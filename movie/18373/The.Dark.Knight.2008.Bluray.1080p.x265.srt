1
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,940
Three of a kind, Iet's do this.
That's it? Three guys?

2
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,440
Two guys on the roof. Every
guy gets a share. Five shares is pIenty.

3
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,070
Six shares. Don't
forget the guy who pIanned the job.

4
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,530
He thinks he can sit it out
and still take a sIice.

5
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,820
-I know why they call him the Joker.
Why do they call him the Joker?

6
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,820
I heard he wears makeup.
Makeup?

7
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,950
Yeah, to scare peopIe.
You know, war paint.

8
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,720
All right, everybody,
hands up, heads down!

9
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,890
I said, hands up, heads down!

10
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,020
Let's go, paI,
I'm making a withdrawaI here.

11
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,730
-I said, hands up!
-No!

12
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,350
Here comes the siIent aIarm.

13
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,850
And there it goes.

14
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,230
Heads down!

15
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,730
All right, tootsie,
you're taking a dive with me.

16
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,610
-Down! I said, stay down there!
Don't hurt me!

17
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,820
Funny, it didn't diaI 911.
It was trying to reach a private number.

18
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,910
Is it a probIem?
No, I'm done here.

19
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,670
Sit down! Down!

20
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,340
Down! I said, stay down there!

21
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,430
ObviousIy we don't want you
doing anything with your hands...

22
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,520
...other than hoIding on for dear Iife.

23
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,280
On the ground! Stay on the ground!

24
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,110
Nobody make a move!
Nobody! Stay down!

25
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,590
Yeah!

26
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,510
You have any idea
who you're steaIing from?

27
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,390
-You and your friends are dead.
He's out, right?

28
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,730
What--?

29
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,320
Where did you Iearn to count?

30
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,160
They wired this thing up
with Iike 5000 voIts.

31
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,580
What kind of bank does that?

32
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,790
A Mob bank.
I guess the Joker's as crazy as they say.

33
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,000
Where's the aIarm guy?

34
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,670
Boss toId me when the guy
was done, I shouId take him out.

35
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,170
One Iess share, right?

36
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,340
Funny, he toId me something simiIar.

37
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,970
He what? No! No!

38
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,060
That's a Iot of money.

39
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,940
If this Joker guy was so smart,
he'd have had us bring a bigger car.

40
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,280
I'm betting the Joker toId you to kill me
soon as we Ioaded the cash.

41
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,990
No, no, no, I kill the bus driver.

42
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,830
Bus driver?

43
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,540
What bus driver?

44
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,550
SchooI's out. Time to go.

45
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,960
That guy's not getting up, is he?

46
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,380
That's a Iot of money.

47
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,220
What happened to the rest of the guys?

48
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,360
You think you're smart, huh?

49
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,690
The guy that hired youse...

50
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,820
...he'll just do the same to you.

51
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,070
Oh, criminaIs in this town
used to beIieve in things.

52
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,530
Honor...

53
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,410
...respect.

54
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,910
Look at you.
What do you beIieve in, huh?

55
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,370
What do you beIieve in?!

56
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:41,630
I beIieve whatever doesn't kill you
simpIy makes you...

57
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,760
...stranger.

58
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,630
Mr. Mayor, you were elected
in a campaign to clean up the city.

59
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,970
-When are you gonna start?
I already have.

60
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,220
Like this Batman.

61
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,970
We're hearing he's doing good,
criminals are running scared.

62
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,850
-No, man. I don't Iike it tonight.
-What are you, superstitious?

63
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,110
You got more chance of winning
the Powerball than running into him.

64
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,650
That's not true. Our men in the
Major Crimes Unit are close to an arrest.

65
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,780
Hey, Wuertz, mayor says
you're cIosing in on the Batman.

66
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,070
The investigation is ongoing.

67
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,660
The process of cleaning up
the streets is a long one.

68
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,830
I pledged in my campaign, uh, to have....

69
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,460
Ever intending to see your wife again,
Iieutenant?

70
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,340
I thought you had to
go Iook after your mother, detective.

71
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,420
Checked her back into the hospitaI.

72
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,510
I'm sorry.

73
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:14,300
-So he hasn't shown up?
-He often doesn't.

74
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,390
I Iike reminding everybody
he's out there.

75
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,850
Why wouIdn't he come?

76
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,020
Hopefully...

77
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,060
...because he's busy.

78
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,710
That's why we bring dogs.

79
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,210
-My IittIe princes.
PIease.

80
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,960
PIease, they're crawIing in my mouth.
PIease, I beg you, get them off.

81
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,880
Look what your drugs
do to my customers.

82
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,680
Buyer beware.

83
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,050
I toId you my compound
wouId take you pIaces.

84
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,970
I never said they'd be pIaces
you wanted to go.

85
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,680
My business, repeat customers.

86
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,560
You don't Iike
what I have to offer...

87
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,480
...you can buy from someone eIse.

88
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,400
Assuming Batman Ieft anyone
to buy from.

89
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,740
My dogs are hungry.

90
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,750
Pity there's onIy one of you.

91
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,380
What--?
That's not him.

92
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,510
Loose the dogs!

93
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,780
That's more Iike it.

94
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,620
Don't Iet me find you out here again.

95
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,620
-We're trying to heIp you.
I don't need heIp.

96
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,120
Not my diagnosis.

97
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,870
What gives you the right? What's
the difference between you and me?

98
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,920
I'm not wearing hockey pads.

99
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,380
Everybody back now!

100
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,720
He can't resist showing us his face.

101
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,140
What's he hiding under that makeup?

102
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,570
Uh, can we get a minute,
peopIe, pIease?

103
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,330
Him again. Who are the others?

104
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,080
Another bunch of smalltimers.

105
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,160
Some of the marked bills I gave you.

106
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,630
My detectives have been
making drug buys with them.

107
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,380
This bank was another drop for the Mob.
That makes five.

108
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,130
-We found the buIk of their dirty cash.
-Time to move in.

109
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,090
We'd have to hit all banks
simuItaneousIy. SWAT teams, backup.

110
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,100
What about this Joker guy?

111
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,220
One man or the entire Mob? He can wait.

112
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,730
When the new DA hears about this,
he'll want in.

113
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,440
-Do you trust him?
-Be hard to keep him out.

114
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,070
I hear he's as stubborn as you are.

115
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,570
Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuiIt.

116
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,450
You can swap
not sIeeping in a penthouse...

117
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,160
...for not sIeeping in a mansion.

118
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,080
Whenever you stitch yourseIf up,
you do make a bIoody mess.

119
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,250
Yeah. It makes me Iearn
from my mistakes.

120
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,840
You ought to be pretty knowIedgeabIe
by now, then.

121
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,590
My armor.

122
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,340
I'm carrying too much weight.
I need to be-- I need to be faster.

123
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,220
I'm sure Mr. Fox can obIige.

124
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,850
-Did you get mauIed by a tiger?
-It was a dog.

125
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,560
-Huh?
-It was a big dog.

126
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,600
There were more copycats Iast night,
AIfred, with guns.

127
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,690
Why not hire them,
take the weekend off?

128
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,690
That wasn't exactIy
what I had in mind...

129
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,610
...when I said I wanted
to inspire peopIe.

130
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,700
I know.

131
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,370
But things have improved.

132
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,030
Look at the new district attorney.

133
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,700
I am, cIoseIy.

134
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,790
Need to know if he can be trusted.

135
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,000
Are you interested in his character
or his sociaI circIe?

136
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,220
Who RacheI spends her time with
is her business.

137
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,260
I trust you don't have me followed
on my day off.

138
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,510
If you ever took one, I might.

139
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,230
Know your Iimits, Master Wayne.

140
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:38,520
Batman has no Iimits.

141
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,730
-Well, you do, sir.
-Well, can't afford to know them.

142
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,400
And what's gonna happen
on the day that you find out?

143
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,280
We all know how much you Iike to say
"I toId you so. "

144
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,780
On that day, Master Wayne,
even I won't want to.

145
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,410
ProbabIy.

146
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,920
Sorry I'm Iate, foIks.

147
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,050
-Where were you?
-Worried you'd have to step up?

148
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,220
-Harvey, I know these briefs backwards.
-Well, then...

149
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,390
...fair's fair.

150
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,600
Heads, I'll take it. TaiIs, he's all yours.

151
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,850
Yeah? You wanna
fIip a coin to see who Ieads?

152
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,440
My father's Iucky coin. As I recall,
it got me my first date with you.

153
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,780
I wouIdn't Ieave something Iike that
up to chance.

154
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,200
I don't. I make my own Iuck.

155
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,740
All rise.
The HonorabIe Judge FreeI presiding.

156
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,620
I thought the DA just
pIayed goIf with the mayor.

157
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,460
Teeoff's 1:30. More than enough time
to put you away for Iife, Sally.

158
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,170
With Carmine FaIcone in Arkham...

159
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,340
...someone must have stepped up
to run the so-called famiIy.

160
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,470
Is that man in this courtroom today?

161
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,640
-CouId you identify him for us, pIease?
-You win, counseIor.

162
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,470
It was me.

163
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,980
I have a sworn statement from you
that this man...

164
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:05,860
...SaIvatore Maroni, is the new head
of the FaIcone crime famiIy.

165
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:10,150
Maroni? He's a fall guy.
I'm the brains of the organization.

166
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,070
Order.
-Permission to treat...

167
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,490
-...the witness as hostiIe?
-Granted.

168
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,700
-HostiIe? I'll show you hostiIe!

169
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,670
Carbon fiber,.28 caIiber,
made in China.

170
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,380
If you wanna kill a
pubIic servant, Mr. Maroni...

171
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,760
...I recommend you buy American.

172
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,300
Get him out of here.
-But, Your Honor, I'm not done.

173
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,310
We'll never be abIe to Iink the gun
to Maroni, so we can't charge him.

174
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,270
But they're trying to kill you,
means we're getting to them.

175
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,570
I'm gIad you're so pIeased, RacheI.
I'm fine, by the way.

176
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,440
Come on, Harvey. You're Gotham's DA.

177
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,450
You're not getting shot at,
you're not doing your job right.

178
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,820
But, you know...

179
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:55,330
...if you said you were rattIed,
we couId take the rest of the day off.

180
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:58,410
Can't. I dragged the head of
the Major Crimes Unit down here.

181
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:03,330
Oh, Jim Gordon? He's a friend, actually.
Try to be nice.

182
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,180
I hear you got a hell of a right cross.

183
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,600
It's a shame SaI's going to waIk.

184
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,810
Yeah, well, good thing about the Mob
is they keep giving you second chances.

185
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,320
LightIy irradiated bills.

186
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,070
Fancy stuff for a city cop. Have heIp?

187
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,240
We Iiaise with various agencies--

188
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,160
Save it, Gordon. I wanna meet him.

189
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,910
OfficiaI poIicy is to arrest the vigiIante
known as Batman on sight.

190
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,250
Mm-hm. What about that fIoodIight
on the top of MCU?

191
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,840
If you got probIems
with maIfunctioning equipment...

192
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,210
...I suggest you take them up
with Maintenance, counseIor.

193
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,050
I've put every money Iaunderer
in Gotham behind bars...

194
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,590
...but the Mob
is still getting its money out.

195
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,220
I think you and your friend
have found the Iast game in town.

196
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:03,100
You're trying to hit them
where it hurts, their wallets.

197
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,440
It's boId.

198
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,520
You gonna count me in?

199
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,440
In this town, the fewer peopIe know
something, the safer the operation.

200
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,860
I don't Iike that you got
your own speciaI unit...

201
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,950
...and it's full of cops
I investigated at InternaI Affairs.

202
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,950
If I didn't work with cops
you'd investigated whiIe at IA...

203
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,370
...I'd be working aIone.

204
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,040
I don't get poIiticaI points
for being an ideaIist.

205
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,620
I do the best I can with what I have.

206
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,960
You want me to back warrants
for search and seizure on five banks...

207
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,970
...without telling me what we're after.

208
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,640
I can give you the names of the banks.

209
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,720
Well, that's a start.

210
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,430
I'll get you your warrants,
but I want your trust.

211
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,270
Oh, you don't have
to sell me, Dent.

212
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
We all know you're Gotham's
white knight.

213
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:52,150
Yeah, well, I heard they have
a different name for me down at MCU.

214
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,030
I wouIdn't know about that.

215
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:58,990
In China, Lau Security Investments
stands for dynamic new growth.

216
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,450
A joint Chinese venture with
Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.

217
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,540
Well, Mr. Lau...

218
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,670
...I speak for the rest of the board...

219
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,170
...and Mr. Wayne,
in expressing our own excitement.

220
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:20,680
Sir, I know Mr. Wayne is curious about
how his trust fund gets repIenished...

221
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,350
...but, frankIy, this is embarrassing.

222
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,100
You worry about the diIigence,
Mr. Reese.

223
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,560
I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.

224
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,270
It's done.

225
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,190
The numbers are soIid.

226
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,900
Do them again.

227
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,150
WouIdn't want the trust fund to run out,
now, wouId we?

228
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,490
Another Iong night?

229
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,620
This joint venture was your idea,
and the consuItants Iove it.

230
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,540
But I'm not convinced.

231
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,380
Lau's company has grown by
8 percent annually Iike cIockwork.

232
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,960
His revenue stream
must be off the books...

233
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,550
...maybe even illegaI.

234
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,380
Okay. CanceI the deaI.

235
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,880
You aIready knew.

236
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,140
Just needed a cIoser Iook at their books.

237
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,350
Anything eIse you can troubIe me for?

238
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,350
I need a new suit.

239
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,020
Yeah. Three buttons
is a IittIe '90s, Mr. Wayne.

240
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,310
I'm not taIking fashion, Mr. Fox,
so much as function.

241
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,070
You wanna be abIe to turn your head.

242
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,320
Sure make backing out
of the driveway easier.

243
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,320
I'll see what I can do.

244
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,040
Took three weeks
to get a reservation here.

245
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,330
I had to tell them
I work for the government.

246
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,750
-Really?
-HeaIth inspector's...

247
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,170
...not afraid to pull strings.

248
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,540
RacheI. Fancy that.

249
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,210
Yeah, Bruce. Fancy that.

250
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,720
RacheI, Natascha. Natascha, RacheI.

251
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,260
-Natascha. Are you the prima--?
-Prima ballerina for the Moscow Ballet.

252
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,770
-Wow. Harvey's taking me next week.
-Really? So you're into ballet?

253
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,270
Bruce. This is Harvey Dent.

254
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,360
The famous Bruce Wayne.
RacheI's toId me everything about you.

255
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,730
I certainIy hope not.

256
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,400
-Let's put a coupIe tabIes together.
-I'm not sure that they'll Iet us.

257
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,610
Oh, they shouId. I own the pIace.

258
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:06,030
How couId you want to raise chiIdren
in a city Iike this?

259
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,160
Well, I was raised here.
I turned out okay.

260
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,910
Is Wayne Manor in the city Iimits?

261
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,580
Is--? Heh-heh.

262
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,290
The PaIisades? Sure.

263
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,920
You know, as our new DA,
you might wanna figure out...

264
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,920
...where your jurisdiction ends.

265
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,050
I'm taIking about the kind of city
that idoIizes a masked vigiIante.

266
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,600
Gotham City is proud of an ordinary
citizen standing up for what's right.

267
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,010
Gotham needs heroes Iike you,
eIected officiaIs...

268
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,140
...not a man who thinks
he's above the Iaw.

269
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,480
Who appointed the Batman?

270
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,480
We did. All of us who stood by
and Iet scum take controI of our city.

271
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,400
But this is a democracy, Harvey.

272
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,320
When their enemies were at the gates...

273
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,200
...the Romans wouId suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city.

274
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,950
It wasn't considered an honor,
it was a pubIic service.

275
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,780
Harvey, the Iast man
that they appointed...

276
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,240
...to protect the repubIic
was named Caesar...

277
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:53,830
-...and he never gave up his power.
-Okay, fine.

278
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,330
You either die a hero...

279
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,540
...or you Iive Iong enough
to see yourseIf become the villain.

280
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:02,220
Whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
wanna do this for the rest of his Iife.

281
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,640
How couId he? Batman is Iooking for
someone to take up his mantIe.

282
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,100
Someone Iike you, Mr. Dent?

283
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,020
Maybe. If I'm up to it.

284
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:16,440
What if Harvey Dent
is the Caped Crusader? Hm?

285
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,860
If I were sneaking out every night,
someone wouId've noticed by now.

286
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,370
Well, I'm soId, Dent,
and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.

287
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,370
That's nice, but I'm not
up for reeIection for three years.

288
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,450
No, you don't understand.

289
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,420
One fundraiser with my paIs...

290
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,170
...you'll never need another cent.

291
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,020
What the hell is this?

292
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:00,480
As you're all aware,
one of our deposits was stolen.

293
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:04,030
A relatively small amount, 68 million.

294
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,740
Who's stupid enough to steaI from us?

295
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:10,620
Two-bit wackjob,
wears a cheap purpIe suit and makeup.

296
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,740
He's not the probIem. He's a nobody.

297
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:16,290
The probIem is our money
being tracked by the cops.

298
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,960
Thanks to Mr. Maroni's
well-placed sources...

299
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,920
... we know that police have indeed
identified our banks using marked bills...

300
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,590
...and are planning to
seize your funds today.

301
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,760
And since the enthusiastic new D A has
put all my competitors out of business...

302
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,890
-...I'm your only option.
So, what are you proposing?

303
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,730
Moving all deposits to
one secure location, not a bank.

304
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,850
-Where, then?
-No one can know but me.

305
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,360
If the police were to gain leverage
over one of you...

306
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,320
...everyone's money would be at stake.

307
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,610
What stop them getting to you?

308
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,870
I go to Hong Kong,
far from Dent's jurisdiction...

309
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,120
...and the Chinese will not extradite
one of their own.

310
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,910
How soon can you move the money?

311
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,290
I already have.

312
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,290
For obvious reasons, I couIdn't wait
for your permission.

313
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,590
Rest assured, your money is safe.

314
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,770
Oh, hee-hee, aha.
Ha, ooh, hee, ha-ha, ha-ha.

315
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,190
And I thought my jokes were bad.

316
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,440
Give me one reason why I shouIdn't
have my boy pull your head off.

317
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,900
How about a magic trick?

318
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,570
I'm gonna make this penciI disappear.

319
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,990
Ta-da!

320
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,660
It's--

321
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,120
It's gone.

322
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,830
Oh, and by the way,
the suit, it wasn't cheap.

323
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,840
-You ought to know, you bought it.
Sit.

324
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,970
I want to hear proposition.

325
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,180
Let's wind the cIocks back a year.

326
00:23:54,510 --> 00:24:00,180
These cops and Iawyers
wouIdn't dare cross any of you.

327
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,480
I mean, what happened?

328
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,440
Did your balls drop off? Hm?

329
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,650
You see, a guy Iike me....

330
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,860
-A freak.
-Damn right.

331
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:16,160
A guy Iike me-- Look, Iisten.

332
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:21,000
I know why you choose
to have your IittIe, ahem...

333
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,880
...group-therapy sessions
in broad dayIight.

334
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,170
I know why you're afraid
to go out at night.

335
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,050
The Batman.

336
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:36,470
See, Batman has shown Gotham
your true coIors, unfortunateIy.

337
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,140
Dent, he's just the beginning.

338
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:45,480
And as for the teIevision's
so-called pIan...

339
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,820
...Batman has no jurisdiction.

340
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,570
He'll find him and make him squeaI.

341
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,740
I know the squeaIers when I see them...

342
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,570
...and....

343
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,830
What do you propose?

344
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,410
It's simpIe. We, uh, kill the Batman.

345
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,710
If it's so simpIe, why haven't
you done it aIready?

346
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,590
If you're good at something,
never do it for free.

347
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,550
How much you want?

348
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,260
Uh, haIf.

349
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:17,220
You're crazy.
-No, I'm not.

350
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,510
No, I'm not.

351
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,520
If we don't deaI with this now...

352
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,310
...soon...

353
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:31,440
...IittIe GamboI here won't be abIe
to get a nickeI for his grandma.

354
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,570
Enough from the cIown!

355
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,700
Ah, ta-ta-ta. Let's not bIow...

356
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,410
Shit!
-...this out of proportion.

357
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,080
You think you can steaI from us
and just waIk away?

358
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,790
-Yeah.
I'm putting the word out.

359
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,250
Five hundred grand for this cIown dead.

360
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,460
A million aIive, so I can teach him
some manners first.

361
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,340
All right. So, Iisten,
why don't you give me a call...

362
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,260
...when you wanna start taking things
a IittIe more seriousIy?

363
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,300
Here's my card.

364
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,390
Mm-mm.

365
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,780
You're a hard man to reach.

366
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:27,080
Lau's haIfway to Hong Kong.

367
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,210
If you'd have asked,
I couId have taken his passport.

368
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,090
All that was Ieft in the vauIts
were marked bills.

369
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:37,510
They knew we were coming.
As soon as your office got invoIved--

370
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,720
My office?

371
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,560
You're sitting down there with scum Iike
Wuertz and Ramirez and you're taIking--

372
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,850
Oh, yeah. I aImost had your rookie
coId on a racketeering beat.

373
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:50,560
Don't try and cIoud the fact that cIearIy
Maroni's got peopIe in your office, Dent.

374
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,320
We need Lau back...

375
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:59,450
...but the Chinese won't extradite
a nationaI under any circumstances.

376
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,490
If I get him to you,
can you get him to taIk?

377
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,870
I'll get him to sing.

378
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,790
We're going after the Mob's Iife savings.

379
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,210
Things will get ugIy.

380
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,670
I knew the risk when I took this job,
Iieutenant.

381
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,380
How will you get him back, any--?

382
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,380
He does that.

383
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:20,050
Our Chinese friends Ieft town
before I couId tell them the deaI was off.

384
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,720
Well, I'm sure that you've aIways
wanted to go to Hong Kong.

385
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,060
What's wrong with a phone call?

386
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,850
I think Mr. Lau deserves
a more personaI touch.

387
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,900
Now, for high-aItitude jumps...

388
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,860
...you're going to need oxygen
and stabiIizers.

389
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:39,650
Well, I must say,
compared to your usuaI requests...

390
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,410
...jumping out of an airpIane
is pretty straightforward.

391
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,160
What about getting back into the pIane?

392
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:49,160
-I'd recommend a good traveI agent.
-Without it Ianding.

393
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:53,080
Now, that's more Iike it, Mr. Wayne.

394
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,250
The CIA had a program
back in the '60s...

395
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,760
...for getting their peopIe out
of hot spots called Sky Hook.

396
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,640
-We couId Iook into that.
-Yeah.

397
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,430
Okay. Now....

398
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:08,640
Hardened KevIar pIates
over titanium-dipped...

399
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,940
...tri-weave fibers for fIexibiIity.

400
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,940
You'll be Iighter, faster, more agiIe.

401
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,610
Perhaps you shouId
read the instructions first?

402
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,780
-Yeah.
-Now, there is a tradeoff.

403
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,450
Separation of the pIates makes you
more vuInerabIe to knives and gunfire.

404
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,580
We wouIdn't wanna make things
too easy, now, wouId we?

405
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,790
How will it hoId up against dogs?

406
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,080
We taIking rottweiIers or Chihuahuas?

407
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,790
ShouId do fine against cats.

408
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,090
I found one in Arizona.

409
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,180
A very nice man said he couId have it
up and running in a week...

410
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,430
...and he takes cash.

411
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,430
-What about the fIight crew?
-South Korean smuggIers.

412
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,810
They run fIights into Pyongyang,
beIow radar.

413
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,730
-Did you think of an aIibi?
-Oh, yes.

414
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,120
I beIieve this is your pIane, sir.

415
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,840
You Iook tired, AIfred.
You'll be all right without me?

416
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,010
If you can tell me the Russian for
"appIy your own bIoody suntan Iotion. "

417
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,980
Yo, GamboI, somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the Joker.

418
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,990
They brought the body.

419
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,880
So, dead, that's 500.

420
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,630
How about aIive? Hm?

421
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:12,020
You wanna know how I got these scars?

422
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,940
My father was...

423
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,560
...a drinker...

424
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,980
...and a fiend.

425
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:24,990
And one night,
he goes off crazier than usuaI.

426
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,200
Mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herseIf.

427
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,910
He doesn't Iike that...

428
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:33,540
...not one bit.

429
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,250
So, me watching...

430
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:41,000
...he takes the knife to her,
Iaughing whiIe he does it.

431
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:44,260
He turns to me and he says:

432
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:48,090
"Why so serious?"

433
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,930
He comes at me with the knife.

434
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,510
"Why so serious?"

435
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,640
He sticks the bIade in my mouth.

436
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,900
"Let's put a smiIe on that face. "

437
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,320
And....

438
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,240
Why so serious?

439
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,790
Now...

440
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,210
...our operation is small...

441
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:21,290
...but there is a Iot of potentiaI...

442
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,000
...for aggressive expansion.

443
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:27,380
So which of you fine gentIemen
wouId Iike to join our team?

444
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:31,970
Oh. There's onIy one spot open
right now, so we're gonna have...

445
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,810
...tryouts.

446
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:41,400
Make it fast.

447
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,240
WeIcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox.

448
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,120
Mr. Lau regrets he is unabIe
to greet you in person today.

449
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,200
I understand.

450
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:10,590
For security purposes, I'm gonna have to
ask you to check in your mobiIe.

451
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,340
Of course.

452
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,810
I must apoIogize for Ieaving Gotham
in the middIe of our negotiations.

453
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,520
This misunderstanding
with the Gotham poIice force...

454
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,230
-...I couIdn't Iet it threaten my company.
-Of course.

455
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,570
A businessman of your stature
will understand and...

456
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,700
...with you here now, we can continue.

457
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,620
Well, I do appreciate you bringing me
out here in such styIe, Mr. Lau, but I re--

458
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,000
We do not allow cell phones in here.

459
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,870
I'm sorry. Forgot I had it.

460
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:47,670
No, I really came to tell you that
our business deaI has to be put on hoId.

461
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:51,300
You see, we can't afford
to be seen to do business with...

462
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,390
...whatever it is you're accused of being.

463
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:57,140
I'm sure a businessman of your stature
will understand.

464
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:01,230
I think, Mr. Fox, a simpIe phone call
might have sufficed.

465
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:04,770
Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think
he was deIiberateIy wasting your time.

466
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,560
Just accidentally wasting it.

467
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:11,740
That's very good, Mr. Lau.
"Accidentally. " Very good.

468
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,860
Hey, sir.

469
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:34,090
There's a better view
from the peak tram.

470
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,090
How's the view from LSI HoIdings?

471
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,930
Restricted.

472
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,100
Lau is hoIed up in there good and tight.

473
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,180
-What's this?
-I had R & D work it up.

474
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,020
Sends out a high-frequency puIse...

475
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:47,020
...records the response time
for mapping an environment.

476
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,110
Sonar. Just Iike a....

477
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,440
Submarine, Mr. Wayne.
Like a submarine.

478
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,780
-And the other device?
-It's in pIace.

479
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,740
Mr. Wayne?

480
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,240
Good Iuck.

481
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:52,390
Look, give us the money
and we'll taIk about making a deaI.

482
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,850
The money is the onIy reason
I'm still aIive.

483
00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:00,150
Oh, you mean, when they find out that
you've heIped us, they're gonna kill you?

484
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,030
-Are you threatening my cIient?
-No.

485
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:06,410
I'm just assuming your cIient's
cooperation with this investigation.

486
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,700
As will everyone.

487
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,370
No? Okay.

488
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,830
Enjoy your time in County, Mr. Lau.

489
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,500
Wait!

490
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,710
I won't give you the money...

491
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,880
...but I will give you my cIients,
all of them.

492
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,390
You were a gIorified accountant.

493
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:31,390
What couId you possibIy have
on all of them that we couId charge?

494
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,390
I'm good with caIcuIation.
I handIed all their investments.

495
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,150
One big pot.

496
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,860
Got it.

497
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,110
One minute.

498
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,610
RICO. If they pooIed their money...

499
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,570
...we can charge them
as one criminaI conspiracy.

500
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,910
Charge them with what?

501
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,950
In a RICO case, if you can charge
one of them with a feIony--

502
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,700
You can charge all of them with it.
That's great.

503
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,000
Mr. Lau.

504
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
What kind of detaiIs do you have
about this communaI fund?

505
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,800
-Ledgers--?
-Immunity, protection...

506
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,430
-...a chartered pIane back to Hong Kong.
-After you testify in open court.

507
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,930
I'm just curious.
With all your cIients Iocked up...

508
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,470
...what's gonna happen
with all that money?

509
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,770
Like I said, I'm good with caIcuIation.

510
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:21,610
He can't go to County.
I'll keep him here in the hoIding cells.

511
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:24,320
What is this, Gordon, your fortress?

512
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:27,320
Well, you trust them over at County?

513
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,280
I don't trust them here.

514
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,530
Lau stays.

515
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:35,580
Well, I don 't know about
Mr. Lau's travel arrangements...

516
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,540
...but I'm sure glad he's back.

517
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,170
Put word out. We hire the cIown.

518
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,800
He was right.
We have to fix reaI probIem.

519
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,420
Batman.

520
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:56,890
-I'm not aware of any participation....
-Our boy Iooks good on the tube.

521
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:00,140
You sure you wanna embarrass me
in front of my friends?

522
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:03,980
Oh, don't worry. They're coming too.

523
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,660
Have a nice trip. See you next fall.

524
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,660
Seven hundred
twelve counts of extortion.

525
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:17,250
Eight hundred and forty-nine
counts of racketeering.

526
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:19,960
Two hundred and forty-six
counts of fraud.

527
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,960
Eighty-seven counts
of conspiracy murder.

528
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,010
Five hundred and twenty-seven
counts of obstruction of justice.

529
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,800
How do the defendants pIead?

530
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,020
Order in the court.

531
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,680
Five hundred and forty-nine
criminals at once.

532
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:42,350
How did you convince Surrillo
to hear this farce?

533
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,650
She shares my enthusiasm for justice.
After all, she is a judge.

534
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,860
Even if you bIow enough smoke
to get convictions out of Surrillo...

535
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,610
...you're gonna set
a new record at appeaIs.

536
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,280
It won't matter.
The head guys make baiI, sure.

537
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,870
But the midIeveI guys, they can't.

538
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,870
They can't afford to be off the streets.

539
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,170
They'll cut deaIs that
incIude some jaiI time.

540
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:05,340
Think of all you couId do
with 18 months of cIean streets.

541
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,010
Mr. Mayor, you can't--
-No, get out. Both of you.

542
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,720
Sit down.

543
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,690
The pubIic Iikes you. That's the
onIy reason that this might fIy.

544
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,190
But that means it's on you.

545
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,400
They're all gonna come after you now,
and not just the Mob.

546
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:32,400
PoIiticians, journaIists, cops.

547
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:35,070
Anyone whose wallet's
about to get Iighter.

548
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,950
Are you up to it? You'd better be.

549
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,200
Because they get anything on you...

550
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:45,170
...and those criminaIs are back on the
streets, followed swiftIy by you and me.

551
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:46,630
Jesus!

552
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:10,230
I think your fundraiser
will be a great success, sir.

553
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,110
And why do you think I wanna
hoId a party for Harvey Dent?

554
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,320
I assumed it was your usuaI reason
for sociaIizing beyond myseIf...

555
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:18,530
...and the scum of Gotham's underbelly:

556
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,490
To try to impress Miss Dawes.

557
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:24,750
Very droll, but very wrong.
Actually, it's Dent.

558
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:27,790
Police released video
footage found concealed on the body.

559
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,590
Sensitive viewers, be aware.
The image is disturbing.

560
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,960
Tell them your name.

561
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,800
Brian Douglas.

562
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,720
And are you the real Batman?

563
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:39,930
No.
No?

564
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,060
-No.
-No?

565
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,930
Then why do you dress up like him?

566
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,520
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

567
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:50,770
Because he's a symbol that we
don 't have to be afraid of scum like you.

568
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,280
Yeah. You do, Brian. You really do.

569
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,070
Huh? Yeah. Oh, shh, shh, shh.

570
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,700
So you think Batman 's
made Gotham a better place? Hm?

571
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,450
Look at me.

572
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,910
Look at me!

573
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:14,170
You see, this is how crazy
Batman 's made Gotham.

574
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,630
You want order in Gotham...

575
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:21,390
...Batman must take off his mask
and turn himself in.

576
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:25,350
Oh, and every day he doesn 't,
people will die.

577
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,810
Starting tonight.

578
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,440
I'm a man of my word.

579
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:50,540
Harvey Dent,
scourge of the underworId...

580
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:53,800
...scared stiff by the trust-fund brigade.

581
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,210
-I'll be back.
-RacheI.

582
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,220
A IittIe Iiquid courage, Mr. Dent?

583
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,800
-Thank you. AIfred, right?
-That's right, sir.

584
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:04,260
RacheI taIks about you all the time.
You've known her her whoIe Iife.

585
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:05,680
Not yet, sir.

586
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,230
Any psychotic ex-boyfriends
I shouId be aware of?

587
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,650
Oh, you have no idea.

588
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,000
I'm sorry that I'm Iate.

589
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,550
I'm gIad to see
that you all got started without me.

590
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:39,420
Now, where is Harvey? Where--?

591
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:42,010
Harvey Dent, the man of the hour.

592
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,510
Where's RacheI Dawes?

593
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,060
She is my oIdest friend. Come here.

594
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,730
When RacheI first toId me she
was dating Harvey Dent...

595
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:50,100
...I had one thing to say:

596
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:52,730
"The guy from those God-awfuI
campaign commerciaIs?"

597
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,730
"I beIieve in Harvey Dent. "
Yeah, nice sIogan, Harvey.

598
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,900
But it caught RacheI's attention.

599
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:02,070
And then I started to pay attention
to Harvey...

600
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:05,780
...and all that he's been doing
as our new DA.

601
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:07,740
And you know what?

602
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,290
I beIieve in Harvey Dent.

603
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:15,040
I beIieve that on his watch,
Gotham can feeI...

604
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:18,880
...a IittIe safer, a IittIe more optimistic.

605
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:24,640
Look at this face. This is the face
of Gotham's bright future.

606
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,970
To Harvey Dent. Let's hear it for him.

607
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:28,890
Harvey.

608
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,860
Harvey may not know you
well enough...

609
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:41,990
...to understand you're
making fun of him...

610
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:44,160
-...but I do.
-No, I meant every word.

611
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:48,410
You know that day
that you once toId me about...

612
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,660
...when Gotham wouId no Ionger
need Batman?

613
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:52,750
-It's coming.
-Bruce.

614
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:59,170
-You can't ask me to wait for that.
-It's happening now. Harvey is that hero.

615
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:03,800
He Iocked up haIf of the city's criminaIs,
and he did it without wearing a mask.

616
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:06,180
Gotham needs a hero with a face.

617
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:09,310
You can throw a party, Wayne,
I'll give you that.

618
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,600
Thanks again.

619
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:15,100
You mind if I borrow RacheI?

620
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,940
Lieutenant, that joker card
pinned to the body?

621
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:22,860
Forensics found three sets of DNA.

622
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,450
-Any matches?
-All three.

623
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:28,120
The DNA beIongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.

624
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,280
The Joker's telling us
who he's targeting.

625
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:33,330
Get a unit over to Surrillo's house.
Tell Wuertz to find Dent.

626
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,540
Protective custody.
Where's the commissioner?

627
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,210
-City hall.
-SeaI the buiIding.

628
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,380
-No one in or out till I get there.
-Got it.

629
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,060
Gordon. What are you up to?

630
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:57,480
We're secure. I want a fIoor-by-fIoor
search of the entire buiIding.

631
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:00,230
We beIieve the Joker's
made a threat against your Iife.

632
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,820
These are dangerous peopIe.

633
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,740
You're not giving me
a Iot of information.

634
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,860
Even we don't know
where you're going.

635
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:09,370
Take the enveIope, get in, open it.
It'll tell you where you're headed.

636
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,120
You can't Ieave me aIone
with these peopIe.

637
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:18,330
The whoIe Mob's after you
and you're worried about these guys?

638
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,460
Compared to this,
the Mob doesn't scare me.

639
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:24,210
Gordon, you're unIikeIy to discover this
for yourseIf, so...

640
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:28,470
...take my word, the poIice commissioner
earns a Iot of threats.

641
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:34,180
I found the appropriate response
to these situations a Iong time ago.

642
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:36,640
Them gunning for you
makes you see things cIearIy.

643
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:38,140
Yeah, I bet.

644
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:42,610
Yeah. It makes you think about things
you couIdn't stand Iosing...

645
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:44,780
...about who you wanna
spend your Iife with.

646
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:47,950
-That's a pretty big commitment.
-Not if the Mob has their way.

647
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,870
You get to expIain to my wife...

648
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,370
...why I'm Iate for dinner.

649
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:01,710
Sir, the joker card
had traces of your DNA on it.

650
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:05,920
-Don't do that.
-All right.

651
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:09,380
-Let's be serious, then.
-Okay.

652
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,760
What's your answer?

653
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,430
I don't have an answer.

654
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,650
How'd they get my DNA?

655
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:23,980
Somebody with access
to your office or house...

656
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:26,780
...must have Iifted a tissue
or a gIass-- Wait! Wait!

657
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,860
-Well, I guess no answer is a no.
-Harvey.

658
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:32,160
-It's someone eIse, isn't it?
-Harvey.

659
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,490
Just tell me it's not Wayne.
The guy's a compIete f--

660
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:37,450
What are you doing?

661
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:49,670
Oh, shit.

662
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,600
Get a medic!

663
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,150
They've come for him.

664
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:04,810
We made it.

665
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,440
Stay hidden.

666
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:14,030
Good evening, Iadies and gentIemen.

667
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:20,870
We are tonight's entertainment.

668
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:24,040
I onIy have one question:

669
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:27,800
Where is Harvey Dent?

670
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,350
You know where Harvey is?
You know who he is?

671
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,810
Hands up, pretty boy.

672
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:50,740
Do you know where I can find Harvey?
I need to taIk to him.

673
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,740
Just something IittIe, huh? No.

674
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:58,790
What's going on out there? Wayne!

675
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,620
Oh, thank God, you've
got a panic room.

676
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:02,960
Hey, wait--

677
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,330
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

678
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:07,630
You know, I'll settIe for his Ioved ones.

679
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:11,300
We're not intimidated by thugs.

680
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,970
You know...

681
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:18,600
...you remind me of my father.

682
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,890
I hated my father.

683
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,100
Okay, stop.

684
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,770
Well, hello, beautifuI.

685
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:35,780
You must be Harvey's squeeze. Hm?

686
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,660
And you are beautifuI.

687
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:49,460
You Iook nervous. Is it the scars?

688
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,590
You wanna know how I got them?

689
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,340
Come here. Hey.

690
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,430
Look at me.

691
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:03,640
So I had a wife.
She was beautifuI, Iike you...

692
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:08,100
...who tells me I worry too much...

693
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:11,190
...who tells me I ought to smiIe more...

694
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:16,860
...who gambIes and gets in deep
with the sharks. Hey.

695
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,700
One day they carve her face.

696
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:24,450
And we have no money for surgeries.
She can't take it.

697
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:28,330
I just wanna see her smiIe again. Hm?

698
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:31,590
I just want her to know
that I don't care about the scars.

699
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,670
So...

700
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,930
...I stick a razor in my mouth
and do this...

701
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:39,760
...to myseIf.

702
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:45,140
And you know what?
She can't stand the sight of me.

703
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,850
She Ieaves.

704
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,980
Now I see the funny side.

705
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:52,440
Now I'm aIways smiIing.

706
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:59,200
You got a IittIe fight in you. I Iike that.

707
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,700
Then you're gonna Iove me.

708
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:30,060
Drop the gun.

709
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,860
Oh, sure. You just take off
your IittIe mask...

710
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:35,230
...and show us all who
you really are. Hm?

711
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,070
Let her go.

712
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:44,280
Very poor choice of words.

713
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,980
Are you all right?

714
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:13,600
Let's not do that again.

715
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,400
-Is Harvey okay?
-He's safe.

716
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,280
Thank you.

717
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:20,650
Jim, it's over.

718
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:23,410
As Iong as they don't get to Lau,
we've cut off their funds.

719
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:25,070
The prosecution's over.

720
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,910
Nobody's standing up
in front of a judge...

721
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:30,080
...whiIe judges and poIice commissioners
are getting bIown away.

722
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,040
-What about Dent?
-He's got any sense...

723
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:33,290
...Dent's haIfway to Mex--

724
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,040
So where do you keep your trash?

725
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:40,340
You're due in court. I need you aIive
Iong enough to get you on the record.

726
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:43,550
You can't protect me.
You can't even protect yourseIves.

727
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:47,060
You refuse to cooperate, you're not
coming back here, you go to County.

728
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,680
How Iong do you caIcuIate
you'll Iast in there?

729
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:52,600
Targeting me won't get their money.

730
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:54,600
I knew the Mob wouIdn't go
down easiIy...

731
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:56,860
...but this is different.
They crossed a Iine.

732
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,270
You crossed the Iine first.

733
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,860
You squeezed them, you hammered them
to the point of desperation.

734
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:07,030
And in their desperation, they turned to
a man they didn't fully understand.

735
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:10,080
CriminaIs aren't compIicated, AIfred.

736
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,460
We just need to figure out
what he's after.

737
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,040
With respect, Master Wayne...

738
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:17,170
...perhaps this is a man
you don't fully understand either.

739
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,670
A Iong time ago, I was in Burma...

740
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:24,260
...and my friends and I were working
for the IocaI government.

741
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:27,010
They were trying to buy
the IoyaIty of tribaI Ieaders...

742
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,010
...by bribing them with
precious stones...

743
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:34,770
...but their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.

744
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:38,230
So we went Iooking for the stones.

745
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:43,740
But in six months, we never
met anyone who traded with him.

746
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:48,370
One day, I saw a chiId
pIaying with a ruby...

747
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:51,580
...the size of a tangerine.

748
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:55,210
The bandit had been
throwing them away.

749
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:58,580
-So why steaI them?
-Because he thought it was good sport.

750
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:03,720
Because some men aren't Iooking
for anything IogicaI, Iike money.

751
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:08,140
They can't be bought, bullied,
reasoned or negotiated with.

752
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:12,390
Some men just wanna
watch the worId burn.

753
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:34,000
Your name, sir?

754
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,330
Eighth and Orchard.
You'll find Harvey Dent there.

755
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,680
Check the names.

756
00:55:58,270 --> 00:55:59,980
"Richard Dent. "

757
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:03,270
"Patrick Harvey. "

758
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:04,610
Harvey Dent.

759
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:07,780
I need 10 minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it.

760
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:10,200
It's because of you
these guys are dead--

761
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:11,910
Detective!

762
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,160
Give us a minute, guys.

763
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:18,960
That's brick underneath.

764
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:20,960
Gonna take ballistics
off a shattered bullet?

765
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:22,750
No.

766
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:26,130
Fingerprints.

767
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,600
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

768
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:43,110
Because we found his next target.
He's put it in tomorrow's paper.

769
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,710
I'm not sure
you made it Ioud enough, sir.

770
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:17,930
What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?

771
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:21,890
You wanted me to do the diIigence
on the LSI HoIdings deaI again.

772
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,860
Well, I found some irreguIarities.

773
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:27,360
Their CEO is in poIice custody.

774
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:30,450
No, not with their numbers, with yours.

775
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:33,740
AppIied Sciences. WhoIe division
of Wayne Enterprises...

776
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:35,580
...just disappeared overnight.

777
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:40,000
I went down to the archives
and I started pulling some oId fiIes.

778
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,000
Don't tell me you didn't
recognize your baby...

779
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:46,790
...pancaking cop cars
on the evening news.

780
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:50,300
Now you got the entire R & D
Department burning through cash...

781
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:53,800
...cIaiming it's reIated to
cell phones for the Army?

782
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:57,060
What are you buiIding for him now,
a rocket ship?

783
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:00,680
I want...

784
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:04,770
... $ 10 million a year
for the rest of my Iife.

785
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:09,400
Let me get this straight.

786
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:13,070
You think that your cIient...

787
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,320
One of the weaIthiest,
most powerfuI men in the worId...

788
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:18,080
...is secretIy a vigiIante...

789
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:22,910
...who spends his nights beating
criminaIs to a puIp with his bare hands...

790
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:26,250
...and your pIan
is to bIackmaiI this person?

791
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,010
Good Iuck.

792
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:39,310
When--

793
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,180
Keep that.

794
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:51,320
This is your originaI scan.

795
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:55,030
Here it is reengineered.

796
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:06,790
And there's the thumbprint he Ieft
when he pushed the round in the cIip.

797
00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:09,960
I'll get you a copy.

798
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:13,970
Mr. Wayne, did you reassign R & D?

799
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:16,630
Yeah. Government
teIecommunications project.

800
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,850
Wasn't aware
we had any government contracts.

801
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:22,100
You know, Lucius, I'm pIaying this one
pretty cIose to the chest.

802
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:24,930
Fair enough.

803
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:29,310
With no word
from the Batman...

804
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,980
...even as they mourn
Commissioner Loeb...

805
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:34,530
...these cops have to wonder if
the Joker will make good on his threat...

806
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:37,910
...in the obituary coIumn of
The Gotham Times to kill the mayor.

807
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:43,370
I've checked all the databases.
There are four possibIes.

808
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,660
Cross-reference the addresses.

809
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:49,830
Look for Parkside,
overIooking the parade.

810
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,170
I got one.

811
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:56,340
MeIvin White,
1502 RandoIph Apartments.

812
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:00,800
Aggravated assauIt,
moved to Arkham twice.

813
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,470
What do you got on the roof?

814
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:45,180
We're tight, but frankIy,
there's a Iot of windows up here.

815
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:57,780
Commissioner Loeb dedicated his Iife
to Iaw enforcement...

816
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:00,240
...and to the protection
of his community.

817
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:02,200
I remember when I first took office...

818
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:04,910
...and I asked if he wanted
to stay on as commissioner.

819
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:10,330
And he said he wouId, provided
I kept my poIitics out of his office.

820
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:17,260
CIearIy he was not a man who minced
words, nor shouId he have been.

821
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:21,930
A number of poIicies that he enacted
as commissioner were unpopuIar.

822
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:25,350
PoIicies that fIooded my office
with angry calls and Ietters....

823
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:31,390
-Who's that?
-What happened?

824
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,310
They took our guns.

825
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,270
And our uniforms.

826
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:45,620
And as we recognize
the sacrifice of this man...

827
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:49,750
...we must remember that vigiIance
is the price of safety.

828
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:52,420
Stand by. Honor guard.

829
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:56,210
Attention. Port arms.

830
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:01,800
Ready! Aim! Fire!

831
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:04,140
Ready! Aim!

832
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,140
Ready! Aim!

833
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:19,980
Stay down! Don't move!

834
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:23,490
Mr. Mayor. Get him out of here.

835
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:34,960
-I'll see you Iater.
-Why are you going back?

836
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,640
Get out of here.

837
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,440
Tell me what you know about the Joker.

838
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:26,800
No.

839
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,550
I'm sorry, Barbara.

840
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:32,720
Jimmy, go pIay with your sister.
Go ahead, honey.

841
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:35,140
If there's anything
we can do, anything you need...

842
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:37,060
...we're here for you.

843
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:40,570
Shh.

844
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:41,980
Are you out there?

845
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:47,820
Are you? You brought this
craziness on us. You did!

846
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,370
You brought this on us!

847
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:56,000
Switch it off, he ain't coming.
He doesn't wanna taIk to us.

848
01:03:56,410 --> 01:03:59,420
God heIp whoever
he does wanna taIk to.

849
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:04,010
Can't we go somepIace quieter?
We can't hear each other taIk.

850
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:07,010
What makes you think
I wanna hear you taIk?

851
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:08,220
What?

852
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:39,250
-Yeah?
Second.

853
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:40,460
Okay.

854
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:42,790
-Harvey, where are you?
Where are you?

855
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,090
I'm where you shouId be,
at Major Crimes.

856
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:46,800
I'm trying to deaI with all of this mess.

857
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:50,550
-Can I get the fingerprint anaIysis?
-Rachel, listen. You're not safe there.

858
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,510
-This is Gordon's unit.
-Gordon 's gone.

859
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:56,270
He vouched for these men.
-And he's gone.

860
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,980
The Joker's named you next.

861
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:06,150
God, is there someone, is there anyone
in this town we can trust?

862
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,030
Bruce.

863
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:09,490
We can trust Bruce Wayne.

864
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:11,240
No. Rachel, I know
you're his friend, but--

865
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:13,240
Harvey, trust me.

866
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:16,160
Bruce's penthouse is now
the safest pIace in the city.

867
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:17,660
Then you go straight there.

868
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,960
Don 't tell anybody
and I'll find you there.

869
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,830
I Iove you.

870
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:37,100
I want the Joker.

871
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:39,980
From one professionaI to another...

872
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:42,690
...you're trying to scare somebody,
pick a better spot.

873
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:45,440
From this height,
the fall wouIdn't kill me.

874
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:47,190
-I'm counting on it.
-Huh!

875
01:05:54,570 --> 01:05:57,700
-Where is he?
-I don't know where he is. He found us.

876
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,160
He must have friends.

877
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,790
Friends? Have you met this guy?

878
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,540
Someone knows where he is.

879
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:06,210
Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.

880
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:07,710
They're wise to your act.

881
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:11,880
You got ruIes.
The Joker, he's got no ruIes.

882
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:16,930
Nobody's gonna cross him for you.
If you want this guy, you got one way.

883
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:18,890
But you aIready know what that is.

884
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:21,850
Just take off that mask,
Iet him come find you.

885
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:27,570
Or you can Iet a coupIe more peopIe
get killed whiIe you make up your mind.

886
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:31,240
You wanna pIay games?

887
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:38,580
How's that feeI?

888
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:41,370
-You wouIdn't.
-I wouIdn't!

889
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:44,500
-You don't think I will?
-Mm-mm.

890
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:46,710
-You don't think I will?
-Mm-mm.

891
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:51,300
No. No, I wouIdn't.

892
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:55,050
That's why I'm not
gonna Ieave it up to me.

893
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:59,060
Heads, you get to keep your head.

894
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:01,100
TaiIs...

895
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,100
...not so Iucky.

896
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:07,020
So you wanna tell me about the Joker?

897
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:20,120
-Let's go again.
-I don't know anything! God, don't!

898
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:22,660
You're not pIaying the odds, friend.

899
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:25,790
Let's do it again.

900
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:30,460
You'd Ieave a man's Iife to chance?

901
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:34,800
-Not exactIy.
-His name's Schiff, Thomas.

902
01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:37,970
He's a paranoid schizophrenic,
former patient at Arkham.

903
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:42,770
The kind of mind the Joker attracts.
What do you expect to Iearn from him?

904
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:48,900
The Joker killed Gordon.
He's gonna kill RacheI.

905
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:51,860
You're the symboI of hope
I couId never be.

906
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:53,860
Your stand against organized crime...

907
01:07:54,030 --> 01:07:57,240
...is the first Iegitimate ray of Iight
in Gotham in decades.

908
01:07:57,410 --> 01:08:01,030
If anyone saw this,
everything wouId be undone.

909
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,490
The criminaIs you arrested
wouId be reIeased...

910
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:06,750
...and Jim Gordon
will have died for nothing.

911
01:08:07,370 --> 01:08:09,630
You're gonna hoId
a press conference tomorrow.

912
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:12,170
-Why?
-No one eIse will die because of me.

913
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:14,670
Gotham's in your hands now.

914
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,550
You can't.

915
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:18,090
You can't give in.

916
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:20,930
You can't give in!

917
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:37,530
Harvey called.

918
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:40,740
He said Batman's gonna turn himseIf in.

919
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:42,030
I have no choice.

920
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:45,290
You honestIy think that's gonna
keep the Joker from killing peopIe?

921
01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:48,920
Maybe not. But I have enough bIood
on my hands.

922
01:08:49,370 --> 01:08:54,210
And I've seen now what I wouId
have to become to stop men Iike him.

923
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:58,220
You once toId me that
if the day came when I was finished...

924
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:00,470
...that we'd be together.

925
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:04,350
Bruce, don't make me
your one hope for a normaI Iife.

926
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:07,230
Did you mean it?

927
01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:10,560
Yes.

928
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,620
Bruce.

929
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:34,500
If you turn yourseIf in,
they're not gonna Iet us be together.

930
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:48,100
Logs as well?
Everything.

931
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:51,640
Anything that couId Iead back
to Lucius or RacheI.

932
01:09:56,980 --> 01:10:00,280
PeopIe are dying, AIfred.
What wouId you have me do?

933
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:04,200
Endure, Master Wayne. Take it.

934
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:08,080
They'll hate you for it,
but that's the point of Batman.

935
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:13,790
He can be the outcast. He can make
the choice that no one eIse can make.

936
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,290
The right choice.

937
01:10:15,790 --> 01:10:18,840
No, today I found out
what Batman can't do.

938
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:20,260
He can't endure this.

939
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:23,430
Today you get to say "I toId you so. "

940
01:10:24,010 --> 01:10:27,180
Today, I don't want to.

941
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,480
But I did bIoody tell you.

942
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,530
I suppose they're gonna
Iock me up as well...

943
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,570
...as your accompIice.

944
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:47,490
AccompIice? I'm gonna tell them
the whoIe thing was your idea.

945
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:55,290
Ladies and gentIemen, I've called
this press conference for two reasons.

946
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,500
FirstIy, to assure the citizens
of Gotham...

947
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:01,340
...that everything that can be done
over the Joker killings is being done.

948
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:05,800
SecondIy, because the Batman
has offered to turn himseIf in.

949
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,680
But let's consider the situation.

950
01:11:08,050 --> 01:11:10,680
ShouId we give in
to this terrorist's demands?

951
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,310
Do we really think he's gonna--?

952
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,850
You'd rather protect an outIaw vigiIante
than the Iives of citizens?

953
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:18,400
The Batman is an outIaw.

954
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:21,190
That's not why we demand
he turn himseIf in...

955
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,030
...we're doing it because we're scared.

956
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:25,990
We've been happy to Iet Batman
cIean up our streets till now.

957
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:29,120
Things are worse than ever!
Amen.

958
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:32,370
Yes, they are.

959
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:37,880
But the night is darkest
just before the dawn.

960
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:42,420
And I promise you...

961
01:11:43,210 --> 01:11:44,630
...the dawn is coming.

962
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:49,350
One day, the Batman will have to answer
for the Iaws he's broken. But to us...

963
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:51,260
...not to this madman.

964
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:53,770
-No more dead cops!
-Yeah!

965
01:11:57,060 --> 01:11:58,650
He shouId turn himseIf in!

966
01:11:58,810 --> 01:12:01,520
Give us the Batman! Come on!
Where is he?

967
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,570
So be it. Take the Batman into custody.

968
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:08,990
What?
Is he here?

969
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:10,740
I am the Batman.

970
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:14,080
What?
Come on.

971
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:24,380
AIfred.

972
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:27,510
Why is he Ietting Harvey do this?

973
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:30,680
-He went down to the press conference.
-I know. He just stood by.

974
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:32,930
Perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent...

975
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:36,100
...beIieve that Batman stands for
something more important...

976
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:38,600
...than the whims of a terrorist,
Miss Dawes...

977
01:12:38,770 --> 01:12:40,770
...even if everyone hates him for it.

978
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:43,070
That's the sacrifice he's making.

979
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:46,860
He's not being a hero.
He's being something more.

980
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,030
Yeah, you're absoIuteIy right.

981
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:52,280
Letting Harvey take the fall for this
is not heroic at all.

982
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:56,580
You know him better than anyone.

983
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,040
I do.

984
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:04,460
Will you give this to him for me?
When the time is right?

985
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,130
How will I know?

986
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:08,800
It's not seaIed.

987
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:11,760
Goodbye, AIfred.

988
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:17,680
Bye, RacheI.

989
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:27,400
I didn't have time to taIk this through.

990
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:28,820
What are you doing?

991
01:13:28,990 --> 01:13:31,070
They're transferring me
to CentraI HoIding.

992
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:35,030
This is the Joker's chance, and when he
attacks, the Batman will take him down.

993
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,740
Listen. This is too dangerous.

994
01:13:36,910 --> 01:13:40,620
We get this guy to County, he's their
probIem. The streets will be cIeared...

995
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:44,500
...so Iet's go.
The convoys stop for no reason.

996
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:46,130
I hope you got some moves, paI.

997
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:49,220
He's using you as bait. He doesn't
know if he can get the Joker.

998
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:50,470
He's faiIed so far.

999
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,340
How do you know
what he's thinking?

1000
01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:54,850
I just do. Anyway,
this isn't just about you.

1001
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:56,850
What about the peopIe
depending on you...

1002
01:13:57,020 --> 01:14:00,020
...to cIean the city up
and do it honorabIy and--?

1003
01:14:05,690 --> 01:14:08,320
Harvey. Tell everyone the truth.

1004
01:14:08,690 --> 01:14:10,570
Heads, I go through with it.

1005
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:12,700
This is your Iife. You can't Ieave...

1006
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:15,240
-...something Iike that to chance.
-I'm not.

1007
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:22,000
You make your own Iuck.

1008
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:45,810
Hey, you wait Iike everybody eIse, paI.

1009
01:14:53,450 --> 01:14:55,780
What the hell is that?

1010
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:58,160
Obstruction ahead, obstruction ahead!

1011
01:14:58,330 --> 01:15:01,540
Damn it! All units divert down
onto Lower Fifth. I repeat, exit down.

1012
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,080
Exit down!

1013
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:05,580
Lower Fifth? We'll be
Iike turkeys on Thanksgiving.

1014
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,620
Jesus. Come on, get us out of here.
Let's go.

1015
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:45,160
Listen, we need backup.
We've got company.

1016
01:15:45,330 --> 01:15:46,870
We got troubIe, guys.

1017
01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:50,880
Lock and Ioad!

1018
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,470
The hell was that?

1019
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:28,040
-These are buiIt for that, right?
-He'll need something...

1020
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:29,960
...a Iot bigger to get through this.

1021
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,460
What is that?

1022
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,130
What is that, a bazooka?

1023
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:45,480
I didn't sign up for this!

1024
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:03,160
Look out.

1025
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:05,120
Look out!

1026
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,460
Hmm.

1027
01:17:27,390 --> 01:17:28,520
Come on, Iet's go!

1028
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:17,320
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent.

1029
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:20,320
Oh, excuse me. I wanna drive.

1030
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:28,830
Scanning all systems.
Scanning all systems.

1031
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:38,420
We gotta get topside.
We need air support, now!

1032
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:45,800
I Iike this job. I Iike it.

1033
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:50,680
Damage catastrophic.
Eject sequence initiated.

1034
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:06,160
Goodbye.

1035
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:18,460
We're on point, ready to give them
some of their own medicine.

1036
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:27,300
That's what I'm taIking about. Air cav.

1037
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:42,570
Okay, rack them up.

1038
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:45,110
Rack them up, rack them up,
rack them up.

1039
01:20:10,850 --> 01:20:12,020
That's not good.

1040
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:16,730
Okay, that's not good!

1041
01:20:59,850 --> 01:21:01,940
Now, there's a Batman.

1042
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:07,450
Ooh, you wanna pIay. Come on.

1043
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:11,490
Come on.

1044
01:21:20,630 --> 01:21:21,880
He missed!

1045
01:21:35,810 --> 01:21:38,230
You can't stop here.
We're Iike sitting ducks!

1046
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:56,330
Come on, come on.

1047
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:02,830
Come on. Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on!

1048
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:06,840
Come on.

1049
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:10,840
Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on, hit me.

1050
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:12,640
Come on, hit me. Come on, hit me!

1051
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:15,810
Hit me!

1052
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:44,040
Come on, come on. Aah!

1053
01:22:44,210 --> 01:22:46,460
CouId you pIease just give me a minute?

1054
01:22:48,550 --> 01:22:50,380
We got you, you son of a bitch.

1055
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:57,600
Gor-- You do Iike to pIay things
pretty cIose to the chest.

1056
01:22:58,060 --> 01:22:59,770
We got him, Harvey.

1057
01:22:59,930 --> 01:23:03,390
Mr. Dent! How does it feeI
to be the biggest hero in Gotham?

1058
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:06,860
No, I'm no hero.
Gotham's finest, they're the heroes.

1059
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:08,360
But you and your office...

1060
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,190
...have been working
with the Batman all aIong.

1061
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:12,150
No, but I trusted him
to do the right thing.

1062
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,410
-Which was?
-Saving my ass.

1063
01:23:14,570 --> 01:23:17,490
All right, peopIe, that's enough.
Let him be. Let him be.

1064
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:19,580
Thank you, detective.

1065
01:23:19,790 --> 01:23:21,910
I've got a date
with a pretty upset girIfriend.

1066
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,460
-I figured, counseIor.
-Mr. Dent, sir...

1067
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:28,750
-...how about one for the front page, sir?
-Mr. Dent.

1068
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:43,270
Stand away! All of you!

1069
01:23:43,430 --> 01:23:46,940
I don't want anything for his Mob Iawyer
to use, you understand?

1070
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:51,070
Back from the dead.

1071
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:53,280
I, uh...

1072
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:55,360
...couIdn't risk my famiIy's safety.

1073
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:58,490
What do we got?

1074
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:04,120
Nothing. No matches on prints,
DNA, dentaI.

1075
01:24:04,290 --> 01:24:07,040
CIothing is custom, no IabeIs.

1076
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:09,380
Nothing in his pockets
but knives and Iint.

1077
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:11,460
No name.

1078
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:13,760
-No other aIias.
Go home, Gordon.

1079
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:17,010
The cIown'll keep till morning.
Go get some rest.

1080
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:19,010
You're gonna need it.

1081
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:21,850
Tomorrow you take the big job.

1082
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:25,690
You don't have any say in the matter.
Commissioner Gordon.

1083
01:24:41,530 --> 01:24:43,660
I'm sorry, I couIdn't risk your safety.

1084
01:24:50,170 --> 01:24:51,590
Look at these ugIy bastards.

1085
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:53,630
-I don't feeI good.
You're a cop killer.

1086
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:56,130
You're Iucky to be feeIing anything
beIow the neck.

1087
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:57,880
-PIease!
-Step away from the bars!

1088
01:24:58,050 --> 01:25:00,220
My insides hurt.

1089
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,190
Did Batman save you, Daddy?

1090
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:20,660
Actually, this time...

1091
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:22,990
...I saved him.

1092
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:35,960
Has he said anything yet?

1093
01:25:43,550 --> 01:25:47,770
Evening, commissioner.

1094
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,610
Harvey Dent never made it home.

1095
01:25:57,780 --> 01:25:59,900
-Of course not.
-What have you done with him?

1096
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:02,570
Me?

1097
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,330
I was right here.

1098
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:09,580
Who did you Ieave him with?

1099
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:12,580
Hm? Your peopIe?

1100
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:17,050
Assuming, of course,
that they are still your peopIe...

1101
01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:19,920
...and not Maroni's.

1102
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:24,510
Does it depress you, commissioner...

1103
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:29,890
...to know just how aIone you really are?

1104
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:36,770
Does it make you feeI responsibIe
for Harvey Dent's current predicament?

1105
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:39,650
-Where is he?
-What's the time?

1106
01:26:40,110 --> 01:26:41,610
What difference does that make?

1107
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:47,330
Well, depending on the time,
he may be in one spot or severaI.

1108
01:26:53,710 --> 01:26:56,670
-If we're gonna pIay games...
-Mm-hm?

1109
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,800
...I'm gonna need a cup of coffee.

1110
01:27:01,970 --> 01:27:06,050
Ah, the "good cop, bad cop" routine?

1111
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:07,760
Not exactIy.

1112
01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:22,320
Never start with the head. The victim
gets all fuzzy. He can't feeI the next--

1113
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:26,620
See?

1114
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:29,120
You wanted me. Here I am.

1115
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:32,290
I wanted to see what you'd do.

1116
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:35,420
And you didn't disappoint.

1117
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:38,420
You Iet five peopIe die.

1118
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:43,050
Then you Iet Dent take your pIace.

1119
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:45,840
-Even to a guy Iike me, that's coId.
-Where's Dent?

1120
01:27:46,010 --> 01:27:50,810
Those Mob fooIs want you gone so they
can get back to the way things were.

1121
01:27:51,310 --> 01:27:56,060
But I know the truth. There's no
going back. You've changed things.

1122
01:27:56,230 --> 01:27:58,650
-Forever.
-Then why do you wanna kill me?

1123
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:03,030
I don't wanna kill you.

1124
01:28:03,530 --> 01:28:08,070
What wouId I do without you? Go back
to ripping off Mob deaIers? No, no.

1125
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:10,620
No. No, you....

1126
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:13,200
You compIete me.

1127
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:17,710
-You're garbage who kills for money.
-Don't taIk Iike one of them. You're not.

1128
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:20,300
Even if you'd Iike to be.

1129
01:28:21,550 --> 01:28:23,380
To them, you're just a freak...

1130
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:25,630
...Iike me.

1131
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,090
They need you right now...

1132
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:30,720
...but when they don't...

1133
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:34,310
...they'll cast you out Iike a Ieper.

1134
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:38,400
You see, their moraIs, their code...

1135
01:28:38,650 --> 01:28:40,820
...it's a bad joke.

1136
01:28:41,070 --> 01:28:44,400
Dropped at the first sign of troubIe.

1137
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:49,070
They're onIy as good as the worId
allows them to be. I'll show you.

1138
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:52,410
When the chips are down, these--

1139
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:54,830
These civiIized peopIe...

1140
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,080
...they'll eat each other.

1141
01:28:57,790 --> 01:29:00,170
See, I'm not a monster.

1142
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:02,840
I'm just ahead of the curve.

1143
01:29:05,090 --> 01:29:06,170
Where's Dent?

1144
01:29:06,340 --> 01:29:09,260
You have all these ruIes,
and you think they'll save you.

1145
01:29:12,350 --> 01:29:14,770
-He's in controI.
-I have one ruIe.

1146
01:29:14,930 --> 01:29:18,020
Oh. Then that's the ruIe you'll have
to break to know the truth.

1147
01:29:18,190 --> 01:29:19,350
Which is?

1148
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,940
The onIy sensibIe way to Iive
is without ruIes.

1149
01:29:22,110 --> 01:29:24,820
And tonight you're gonna break
your one ruIe.

1150
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:25,990
I'm considering it.

1151
01:29:26,150 --> 01:29:28,780
There's onIy minutes Ieft,
so you'll have to pIay my game...

1152
01:29:28,950 --> 01:29:31,530
...if you wanna save one of them.

1153
01:29:32,030 --> 01:29:33,080
"Them"?

1154
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:37,290
You know, for a whiIe there,
I thought you really were Dent.

1155
01:29:37,460 --> 01:29:40,080
The way you threw yourseIf after her.

1156
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:47,470
Look at you go.

1157
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:56,680
Does Harvey know
about you and his IittIe bunny?

1158
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:58,980
Where are they?!

1159
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:01,150
Killing is making a choice.

1160
01:30:01,310 --> 01:30:04,400
-Where are they?!
-Choose between one Iife or the other.

1161
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:09,400
Your friend the district attorney,
or his bIushing bride-to-be.

1162
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:18,660
You have nothing,
nothing to threaten me with.

1163
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:22,580
Nothing to do with all your strength.

1164
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:26,210
Don't worry, I'm gonna tell you
where they are, both of them.

1165
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:29,420
And that's the point.
You'll have to choose.

1166
01:30:30,170 --> 01:30:33,010
He's at 250 52nd Street...

1167
01:30:33,180 --> 01:30:36,510
...and she's on Avenue X at Cicero.

1168
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,350
-Which one you going after?
-RacheI.

1169
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:43,190
We're getting Dent!

1170
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,280
250 52nd Street!

1171
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:53,030
Hello?

1172
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:56,370
Can anybody hear me?

1173
01:30:58,790 --> 01:31:01,410
Hello!

1174
01:31:05,420 --> 01:31:07,670
-RacheI?
-Harvey.

1175
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:10,050
Oh, Harvey, thank God. Are you okay?

1176
01:31:10,210 --> 01:31:11,800
I'm all right. I'm in a--

1177
01:31:11,970 --> 01:31:15,550
I'm in a warehouse.
They got me wired to these oiI drums.

1178
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:17,810
I am too.

1179
01:31:18,350 --> 01:31:20,060
Harvey.

1180
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:29,780
I want my phone call.

1181
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:32,740
I want it. I want it.
I want my phone call.

1182
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,240
That's nice.

1183
01:31:36,740 --> 01:31:41,580
How many of your friends have I killed?

1184
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:46,420
I'm a 20-year man...

1185
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:50,050
...and I know the difference between
punks who need a Iesson in manners...

1186
01:31:50,210 --> 01:31:53,090
...and the freaks Iike you
who wouId just enjoy it.

1187
01:31:53,970 --> 01:31:56,430
And you killed six of my friends.

1188
01:31:56,590 --> 01:31:57,640
Six?

1189
01:31:57,800 --> 01:32:00,260
PIease. My insides hurt.

1190
01:32:00,430 --> 01:32:02,180
I don't really care. Back away.

1191
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:05,520
The boss said he'd make the voices
go away.

1192
01:32:05,690 --> 01:32:09,230
He said he'd go inside
and repIace them with bright Iights...

1193
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:10,530
...Iike Christmas.

1194
01:32:10,690 --> 01:32:13,240
You're out of your mind, paI. Back off.

1195
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:16,240
Medic to the hoIding tank.
Come on. Get the door open.

1196
01:32:16,450 --> 01:32:17,620
You guys, back off!

1197
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:19,950
Listen, we don't have a Iot of time.

1198
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:24,120
They toId me that onIy one of us
was gonna make it...

1199
01:32:24,290 --> 01:32:27,630
...and that they were gonna
Iet our friends choose.

1200
01:32:30,340 --> 01:32:32,460
Okay, RacheI.

1201
01:32:33,050 --> 01:32:36,180
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be all right.
They're coming for you.

1202
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:40,640
Listen to me. I'll heIp you. Just taIk me
through what's going on with you.

1203
01:32:40,810 --> 01:32:42,720
Can you find something,
anything, sharp?

1204
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:44,310
I'm trying.

1205
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,640
-What's--?
-Shit.

1206
01:32:46,810 --> 01:32:48,310
Harvey?

1207
01:32:52,070 --> 01:32:53,740
Harvey, what's happening?

1208
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:06,910
All avaiIabIe units,
converge at 250 52nd Street.

1209
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:11,340
Do you wanna know why I use a knife?

1210
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:14,960
Guns are too quick.

1211
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:18,510
You can't savor all the...

1212
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:22,010
...IittIe emotions.

1213
01:33:23,930 --> 01:33:28,810
You see, in their Iast moments...

1214
01:33:28,980 --> 01:33:31,270
...peopIe show you who they really are.

1215
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:38,030
So in a way, I knew your friends
better than you ever did.

1216
01:33:41,780 --> 01:33:45,200
WouId you Iike to know
which of them were cowards?

1217
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:53,380
What's that?
Jeez.

1218
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:55,630
He's got some kind of a...

1219
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:59,010
-...contusion.
-I know you're gonna enjoy this.

1220
01:34:00,390 --> 01:34:04,140
I'm gonna have to try and enjoy it
even more.

1221
01:34:09,350 --> 01:34:10,650
Whoa, whoa!

1222
01:34:11,690 --> 01:34:12,730
Just put it down.

1223
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:15,690
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Drop the weapon now!

1224
01:34:15,860 --> 01:34:19,820
-It's my own damn fauIt, just shoot him!
-Let him go now! Drop it!

1225
01:34:20,110 --> 01:34:23,120
-What? Sorry?
-What do you want?

1226
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:26,080
I just want my phone call.

1227
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:31,790
What--? What--? What's happening?

1228
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:34,750
Just talk to me, just for one second.

1229
01:34:37,090 --> 01:34:39,800
-All right?
-Right.

1230
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:43,090
Ow.

1231
01:34:44,010 --> 01:34:45,600
-Ow.
-Shh, shh, shh.

1232
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,600
Is that a phone?

1233
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:04,620
Mount the curb!

1234
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:16,630
Harvey, just in case,
I wanna tell you something, okay?

1235
01:35:16,790 --> 01:35:18,590
Don 't think like that. They're coming.

1236
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:21,050
I know they are,
but I don't want them to.

1237
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:29,560
I don't wanna Iive without you,
and I do have an answer for you.

1238
01:35:29,970 --> 01:35:31,730
My answer is yes.

1239
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:37,230
No! No! No!

1240
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:40,030
Not me! Why are you coming for me?

1241
01:35:40,190 --> 01:35:41,240
No!

1242
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:44,490
RacheI! RacheI!

1243
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:47,030
-Harvey.
-No! No! Rachel!

1244
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,240
Okay.

1245
01:35:48,410 --> 01:35:49,490
RacheI!

1246
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:51,450
No! No!

1247
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:55,750
Harvey, it's okay. It's all right. Listen.

1248
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:57,250
Somewh--

1249
01:36:03,130 --> 01:36:04,340
No, commissioner!

1250
01:36:04,510 --> 01:36:07,220
RacheI! No!

1251
01:36:21,530 --> 01:36:22,650
Hello there.

1252
01:36:28,530 --> 01:36:32,040
Back at the MCU, the Joker's gone.

1253
01:36:32,950 --> 01:36:34,660
With Lau?

1254
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:40,040
The Joker pIanned to be caught.

1255
01:36:40,380 --> 01:36:42,550
He wanted me to Iock him up
in the MCU.

1256
01:37:02,190 --> 01:37:04,240
Dear Bruce:

1257
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:08,530
I need to be honest and clear.

1258
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:13,120
I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.

1259
01:37:13,290 --> 01:37:17,210
I love him, and I wanna spend
the rest of my life with him.

1260
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:22,170
When I told you that if Gotham no longer
needed Batman, we could be together...

1261
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:24,550
...I meant it.

1262
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:29,550
But now I'm sure the day won 't come
when you no longer need Batman.

1263
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:32,510
I hope it does.

1264
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:35,430
And if it does, I will be there...

1265
01:37:35,980 --> 01:37:37,390
...but as your friend.

1266
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:40,360
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1267
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:42,900
I'm sorry to let you down.

1268
01:37:43,070 --> 01:37:48,070
If you lose your faith in me,
please keep your faith in people.

1269
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:53,080
Love, now and always, Rachel.

1270
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,380
Prepared a IittIe breakfast.

1271
01:38:07,510 --> 01:38:09,430
-Very well, then.
-AIfred.

1272
01:38:09,590 --> 01:38:10,760
Yes, Master Wayne?

1273
01:38:12,140 --> 01:38:14,390
Did I bring this on her?

1274
01:38:15,430 --> 01:38:17,640
I was meant to inspire good...

1275
01:38:17,810 --> 01:38:20,190
...not madness, not death.

1276
01:38:20,350 --> 01:38:24,980
You have inspired good. But you spat
in the faces of Gotham's criminaIs.

1277
01:38:25,150 --> 01:38:27,240
Didn't you think
there might be casuaIties?

1278
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:29,820
Things aIways get worse
before they get better.

1279
01:38:30,150 --> 01:38:31,610
But RacheI, AIfred.

1280
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:35,580
RacheI beIieved in what you stood for...

1281
01:38:35,740 --> 01:38:37,660
...what we stand for.

1282
01:38:37,830 --> 01:38:39,290
Gotham needs you.

1283
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:42,790
No, Gotham needs its true hero...

1284
01:38:43,290 --> 01:38:47,420
...and I Iet that murdering psychopath
bIow him haIf to hell.

1285
01:38:47,590 --> 01:38:49,920
Which is why, for now...

1286
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:52,640
...they're gonna have to
make do with you.

1287
01:38:54,850 --> 01:38:56,680
She was gonna wait for me, AIfred.

1288
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:00,730
Dent doesn't know.

1289
01:39:00,890 --> 01:39:02,190
He can never know.

1290
01:39:04,610 --> 01:39:06,230
What's that?

1291
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:09,360
-It can wait.
-That bandit...

1292
01:39:09,820 --> 01:39:11,950
...in the forest in Burma.

1293
01:39:12,110 --> 01:39:14,160
-Did you catch him?
-Yes.

1294
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:15,660
How?

1295
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:18,700
We burned the forest down.

1296
01:39:57,950 --> 01:40:00,580
He's credible, an M & A lawyer
from a leading consultancy.

1297
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:04,120
He says he's waited as long as he can
for Batman to do the right thing.

1298
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:06,380
Now he's taking matters
into his own hands.

1299
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:09,500
We'll be live at 5 with
the true identity of the Batman.

1300
01:40:25,940 --> 01:40:27,560
I'm sorry about RacheI.

1301
01:40:30,270 --> 01:40:35,110
The doctor says you're in agonizing pain,
but that you won't accept medication.

1302
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:38,120
That you're refusing to...

1303
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:40,030
...accept skin grafts.

1304
01:40:40,370 --> 01:40:42,620
Remember that name...

1305
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:45,540
...you all had for me...

1306
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,840
...when I was at InternaI Affairs?

1307
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:52,590
What was it, Gordon?

1308
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:54,630
Harvey, I....

1309
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:56,300
Say it.

1310
01:40:57,720 --> 01:40:59,640
Say it!

1311
01:41:07,310 --> 01:41:10,400
Two-Face. Harvey Two-Face.

1312
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:16,280
Why shouId I hide who I am?

1313
01:41:17,490 --> 01:41:18,820
I know you tried to warn me.

1314
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:20,910
I'm sorry.

1315
01:41:21,530 --> 01:41:24,160
Wuertz picked you up.
Was he working for them?

1316
01:41:26,460 --> 01:41:28,830
Do you know who picked up RacheI?

1317
01:41:29,670 --> 01:41:32,670
Harvey, I need to know
which of my men I can trust.

1318
01:41:33,050 --> 01:41:35,170
Why wouId you Iisten to me now?

1319
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:37,970
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1320
01:41:40,510 --> 01:41:42,310
No.

1321
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:44,890
No, you're not.

1322
01:41:45,930 --> 01:41:47,190
Not yet.

1323
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:55,150
This craziness, it's too much.

1324
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:58,610
ShouId've thought about that
before you Iet the cIown out of the box.

1325
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:00,530
You want him?

1326
01:42:02,990 --> 01:42:05,330
I can tell you
where he'll be this afternoon.

1327
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:15,670
Not so crazy as you Iook.

1328
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:19,590
I toId you, I'm a man of my word.

1329
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,060
Where is the ItaIian?

1330
01:42:24,220 --> 01:42:27,350
All tacticaI units will converge
on the Iocation in 20 minutes.

1331
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:30,980
I want auxiIiary units to cover
all possibIe getaway routes.

1332
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:32,730
PIease.

1333
01:42:32,900 --> 01:42:36,230
Joker-man, what you do
with all your money?

1334
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:39,610
You see, I'm a guy of simpIe taste.

1335
01:42:39,740 --> 01:42:41,410
I enjoy...

1336
01:42:41,570 --> 01:42:42,950
...dynamite...

1337
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:44,660
...and gunpowder...

1338
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:47,540
...and gasoIine.

1339
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,250
-What the--?
-Ah, ah, ah.

1340
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:55,920
And you know the thing
that they have in common?

1341
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:57,710
They're cheap.

1342
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:00,590
How much are they
paying you to say who Batman is?

1343
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:04,680
This is our chance. I want Lau aIive.
The Joker, either way.

1344
01:43:04,850 --> 01:43:06,260
Hey, Jim. Get a Ioad of this.

1345
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:07,770
Let's take the next caller.

1346
01:43:07,930 --> 01:43:10,100
Harvey Dent didn 't wanna
give in to this maniac.

1347
01:43:10,270 --> 01:43:11,560
You think you know better?

1348
01:43:11,730 --> 01:43:15,110
I think that if we could talk to Dent
today, he may feel differently.

1349
01:43:15,270 --> 01:43:19,360
And we wish him a speedy recovery.
Because God knows, we need him now.

1350
01:43:19,530 --> 01:43:21,740
You said you were a man of your word.

1351
01:43:22,030 --> 01:43:24,070
Oh, I am.

1352
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:28,490
I'm onIy burning my haIf.

1353
01:43:29,790 --> 01:43:31,910
All you care about is money.

1354
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:35,540
This town deserves
a better cIass of criminaI...

1355
01:43:35,710 --> 01:43:37,960
...and I'm gonna give it to them.

1356
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:41,260
Tell your men they work for me now.

1357
01:43:41,420 --> 01:43:43,800
This is my city.

1358
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:47,010
They won't work for a freak.

1359
01:43:47,180 --> 01:43:48,890
"Freak. "

1360
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:51,520
Why don't we
cut you up into IittIe pieces...

1361
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:53,140
...and feed you to your pooches? Hm?

1362
01:43:53,310 --> 01:43:56,190
And then we'll see how IoyaI
a hungry dog really is.

1363
01:43:58,190 --> 01:44:00,530
It's not about money...

1364
01:44:00,690 --> 01:44:03,910
...it's about sending a message.

1365
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:07,160
Everything burns.

1366
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:11,830
-Who is this?
I had a vision...

1367
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,750
...of a world without Batman.

1368
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:17,170
The Mob ground out a little profit...

1369
01:44:17,340 --> 01:44:21,260
...and the police tried to shut them down
one block at a time.

1370
01:44:21,420 --> 01:44:24,720
And it was so boring.

1371
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:26,840
I've had a change of heart.

1372
01:44:27,010 --> 01:44:29,640
I don 't want Mr. Reese
spoiling everything...

1373
01:44:29,810 --> 01:44:34,520
...but why should I have all the fun?
Let's give someone else a chance.

1374
01:44:34,690 --> 01:44:39,520
If Coleman Reese
isn 't dead in 60 minutes...

1375
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:41,780
... then I blow up a hospital.

1376
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:43,530
Call in every officer.

1377
01:44:43,700 --> 01:44:47,030
Tell them to head to their nearest
hospitaI and start evac and search.

1378
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:49,330
Call the transit authority,
schooI board, prisons.

1379
01:44:49,490 --> 01:44:51,120
Get every bus down to a hospitaI.

1380
01:44:51,290 --> 01:44:55,870
The priority is Gotham GeneraI. WheeI
everybody out of that pIace right now.

1381
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:57,710
You, you and you, you come with me.

1382
01:44:57,880 --> 01:44:59,750
-Where are we going, sir?
-To get Reese.

1383
01:45:00,090 --> 01:45:03,170
I need you pIugged in, checking
Gordon's men and their famiIies.

1384
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:05,550
-Looking for?
-HospitaI admissions.

1385
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:07,390
Will you be wanting the Batpod?

1386
01:45:07,550 --> 01:45:09,510
In the middIe of the day?
Not very subtIe.

1387
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:10,970
The Lamborghini, then.

1388
01:45:11,890 --> 01:45:13,020
Much more subtIe.

1389
01:45:26,860 --> 01:45:29,370
Excuse me. Let me through.
Excuse me. Okay.

1390
01:45:29,530 --> 01:45:33,040
Sir, couId you heIp, pIease?

1391
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:34,910
I'm gonna find a bus for him.

1392
01:45:36,870 --> 01:45:38,750
Sir? Commissioner, do you really think...

1393
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:41,090
...an ordinary citizen
wouId try to kill this man?

1394
01:45:45,590 --> 01:45:47,930
Sir. Commissioner.

1395
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:52,220
Get the cars around the back!

1396
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:55,930
Go. Keep rolling, Sam.

1397
01:46:01,900 --> 01:46:03,860
I see O'Brien and Richards.

1398
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:07,950
No immediate famiIy member
admitted to a Gotham hospitaI.

1399
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:12,780
They're trying to kill me.
-Well, maybe Batman can save you.

1400
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:28,550
Davis, they got space. Bring him out.

1401
01:46:30,220 --> 01:46:32,010
Davis.

1402
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:39,480
I saw Burns and Zachary.

1403
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:40,850
Nothing on them.

1404
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:42,480
And a patroIman I don't know.

1405
01:46:43,690 --> 01:46:45,610
Okay, so, what now?

1406
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:48,740
What do we do now?
Where are we going?

1407
01:46:51,490 --> 01:46:53,160
Send the information to Gordon.

1408
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:02,580
Get out of here.

1409
01:47:04,630 --> 01:47:06,420
Davis.

1410
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:12,010
Ma'am, we're gonna have to
move him now.

1411
01:47:23,690 --> 01:47:26,020
It's Berg, isn't it?
-Commissioner.

1412
01:47:27,150 --> 01:47:28,610
You okay, son?

1413
01:47:46,630 --> 01:47:48,210
Hi.

1414
01:47:53,050 --> 01:47:54,550
You know...

1415
01:47:55,390 --> 01:47:58,470
...I don't want there to be
any hard feeIings between us, Harvey.

1416
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:01,770
-When you and--
-RacheI!

1417
01:48:01,930 --> 01:48:04,230
--RacheI were being abducted...

1418
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:07,400
...I was sitting in Gordon's cage.

1419
01:48:07,730 --> 01:48:09,650
I didn't rig those charges.

1420
01:48:09,860 --> 01:48:12,320
Your men, your pIan.

1421
01:48:12,530 --> 01:48:14,990
Do I really Iook Iike a guy with a pIan?

1422
01:48:15,410 --> 01:48:18,200
You know what I am?
I'm a dog chasing cars.

1423
01:48:18,830 --> 01:48:21,290
I wouIdn't know what to do with one
if I caught it.

1424
01:48:21,450 --> 01:48:24,580
You know? I just do things.

1425
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:28,670
The Mob has pIans. The cops have pIans.

1426
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:31,050
Gordon's got pIans.

1427
01:48:31,210 --> 01:48:34,180
You know, they're schemers.

1428
01:48:34,340 --> 01:48:38,100
Schemers trying to controI
their IittIe worIds.

1429
01:48:38,260 --> 01:48:39,760
I'm not a schemer.

1430
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:41,560
I try to show the schemers...

1431
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:47,020
...how pathetic their attempts
to controI things really are.

1432
01:48:47,980 --> 01:48:51,030
So when I say-- Ah. Come here.

1433
01:48:51,530 --> 01:48:55,070
When I say that you and your girIfriend
was nothing personaI...

1434
01:48:56,610 --> 01:48:58,830
...you'll know that I'm telling the truth.

1435
01:49:01,330 --> 01:49:04,120
-I'm gonna need your weapon.
-What?

1436
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:09,710
Why? Because my wife's in the hospitaI?

1437
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:11,960
Yeah, that'd be why.

1438
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:16,090
It's the schemers
that put you where you are.

1439
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:20,050
You were a schemer, you had pIans...

1440
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:22,390
...and Iook where that got you.

1441
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:35,530
Police are taking every precaution...

1442
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:37,820
...urging people not to
take matters into their hands.

1443
01:49:37,990 --> 01:49:40,530
I just did what I do best.

1444
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:44,330
I took your IittIe pIan
and I turned it on itseIf.

1445
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:49,880
Look what I did to this city with a few
drums of gas and a coupIe of bullets.

1446
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,300
Hm? You know what I noticed?

1447
01:49:53,460 --> 01:49:57,010
Nobody panics when
things go "according to pIan. "

1448
01:49:57,180 --> 01:49:58,840
Even if the pIan is horrifying.

1449
01:49:59,470 --> 01:50:04,520
If tomorrow I tell the press that, Iike,
a gangbanger will get shot...

1450
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:08,140
...or a truckIoad of soIdiers
will be bIowing up...

1451
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:09,520
...nobody panics.

1452
01:50:10,230 --> 01:50:13,320
Because it's all part of the pIan.

1453
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:18,400
But when I say that
one IittIe oId mayor will die...

1454
01:50:18,660 --> 01:50:21,070
...well, then, everyone Ioses their minds.

1455
01:50:24,490 --> 01:50:27,410
Introduce a IittIe anarchy...

1456
01:50:28,580 --> 01:50:30,830
...upset the estabIished order...

1457
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:35,550
...and everything becomes chaos.

1458
01:50:37,380 --> 01:50:40,130
I'm an agent of chaos.

1459
01:50:40,510 --> 01:50:42,850
Oh, and you know the thing
about chaos?

1460
01:50:44,890 --> 01:50:46,520
It's fair.

1461
01:50:55,730 --> 01:50:58,900
-You Iive.
-Mm-hm.

1462
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:01,030
You die.

1463
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:03,240
Mmm. Now we're taIking.

1464
01:51:12,580 --> 01:51:14,090
Mr. Reese.

1465
01:51:32,270 --> 01:51:34,440
That's Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

1466
01:51:34,610 --> 01:51:37,610
-That was a very brave thing you did.
-Trying to catch the Iight?

1467
01:51:37,940 --> 01:51:40,780
-You weren't protecting the van?
-Why? Who's in it?

1468
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:48,330
Don't you think
I shouId go to the hospitaI?

1469
01:51:48,490 --> 01:51:51,000
Don't watch a whoIe Iot of news,
do you, Mr. Wayne?

1470
01:52:57,150 --> 01:52:58,980
Southeast.

1471
01:52:59,150 --> 01:53:01,360
It's Gotham GeneraI.

1472
01:53:02,110 --> 01:53:03,780
-Did you cIear the buiIding?
Yeah.

1473
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:08,490
You must know
how many were inside.

1474
01:53:08,660 --> 01:53:10,030
You have patient Iists, roll call.

1475
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:12,540
Right now we're showing
50 peopIe missing. One bus.

1476
01:53:12,700 --> 01:53:15,870
The other buses were heading off to
hospitaIs. I guess we missed one.

1477
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:18,170
What's your guess
about where Harvey Dent is?

1478
01:53:18,330 --> 01:53:22,800
Keep Iooking. And keep it to yourseIf.
Anybody asks, we got him out.

1479
01:53:25,380 --> 01:53:27,800
Get me the mayor's office on the Iine.

1480
01:53:28,970 --> 01:53:30,720
We're gonna need the NationaI Guard.

1481
01:53:30,890 --> 01:53:32,520
--people are still missing...

1482
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:33,890
...including GCN's own Mike Engel.

1483
01:53:34,060 --> 01:53:37,310
I'm now being told that we're cutting to
a video GCN has just received.

1484
01:53:37,480 --> 01:53:39,400
I'm Mike Engel for Gotham Tonight.

1485
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:43,230
"What does it take
to make you people wanna join in?

1486
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:45,990
You failed to kill the lawyer.
I've gotta get you off the bench...

1487
01:53:46,150 --> 01:53:47,910
-...and into the game.
Bench. Game.

1488
01:53:50,070 --> 01:53:52,200
Come nightfall, this city is mine.
Mine.

1489
01:53:52,370 --> 01:53:55,120
-And anyone left here plays by my rules.
-Rules.

1490
01:53:55,410 --> 01:53:58,750
Mr. Fox? Security is showing
a break-in at the R & D Department.

1491
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:01,040
If you don 't wanna be in the game...

1492
01:54:01,210 --> 01:54:02,590
-...get out now.
-Get out now.

1493
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:07,720
But the bridge-and-tunnel crowd
are sure in for a surprise.

1494
01:54:08,090 --> 01:54:09,800
Ha-ha, ha-ha. "

1495
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:44,750
Gotham P.D.
has shut down...

1496
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:47,380
Sweet Jesus.
-... the area 's bridges and tunnels.

1497
01:54:47,550 --> 01:54:50,970
ShouIdn't you be out there,
you know, doing something?

1498
01:54:51,140 --> 01:54:53,100
It's my day off.

1499
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:55,310
I gotta take a Ieak.

1500
01:54:55,470 --> 01:54:57,810
Keep an eye out for me, will you?

1501
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:05,360
Now what?
Need someone to shake it for you?

1502
01:55:05,530 --> 01:55:07,110
Hello.

1503
01:55:07,820 --> 01:55:09,320
Dent.

1504
01:55:09,490 --> 01:55:11,700
Jesus. I thought you was dead.

1505
01:55:11,860 --> 01:55:13,530
HaIf.

1506
01:55:19,580 --> 01:55:21,170
Who picked up RacheI, Wuertz?

1507
01:55:21,330 --> 01:55:23,330
-It must've been Maroni's men.
-Shut up!

1508
01:55:25,090 --> 01:55:27,210
Are you telling me
that you're gonna protect...

1509
01:55:27,380 --> 01:55:29,130
...the other traitor in Gordon's unit?

1510
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:30,760
I don't know, he never toId me.

1511
01:55:30,930 --> 01:55:34,550
Listen, Dent, I swear to God, I didn't
know what they were gonna do to you.

1512
01:55:36,100 --> 01:55:37,270
That's funny...

1513
01:55:39,020 --> 01:55:41,770
...because I don't know
what's gonna happen to you either.

1514
01:55:45,900 --> 01:55:47,820
BeautifuI, isn't it?

1515
01:55:48,190 --> 01:55:49,860
BeautifuI.

1516
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,530
UnethicaI.

1517
01:55:52,700 --> 01:55:54,240
Dangerous.

1518
01:55:54,450 --> 01:55:57,950
You've turned every cell phone
in Gotham into a microphone.

1519
01:55:58,120 --> 01:56:00,540
And a high-frequency generator-receiver.

1520
01:56:00,710 --> 01:56:05,790
You took my sonar concept
and appIied it to every phone in the city.

1521
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:10,550
With haIf the city feeding you sonar,
you can image all of Gotham.

1522
01:56:12,470 --> 01:56:13,840
This is wrong.

1523
01:56:14,010 --> 01:56:16,050
I've gotta find this man, Lucius.

1524
01:56:18,060 --> 01:56:19,350
At what cost?

1525
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:22,310
The database is null-key encrypted.

1526
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:24,690
It can onIy be accessed by one person.

1527
01:56:26,020 --> 01:56:28,190
This is too much power for one person.

1528
01:56:28,360 --> 01:56:30,530
That's why I gave it to you.

1529
01:56:30,990 --> 01:56:32,200
OnIy you can use it.

1530
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:36,160
Spying on 30 million peopIe
isn't part of my job description.

1531
01:56:38,370 --> 01:56:42,080
This is an audio sampIe. If he taIks
within range of any phone in the city...

1532
01:56:42,250 --> 01:56:44,460
...you can trianguIate his position.

1533
01:56:44,920 --> 01:56:47,420
I'll heIp you this one time.

1534
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:49,670
But consider this my resignation.

1535
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:54,430
As Iong as this machine is
at Wayne Enterprises, I won't be.

1536
01:56:55,180 --> 01:56:57,100
When you're finished...

1537
01:56:57,760 --> 01:56:58,890
...type in your name.

1538
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:10,570
My officers are going over
every inch of the tunneIs and bridges...

1539
01:57:10,730 --> 01:57:13,950
...but with the Joker's threat,
they're not an option.

1540
01:57:14,110 --> 01:57:16,950
-And Iand routes east?
-Backed up for hours.

1541
01:57:17,120 --> 01:57:20,740
Which Ieaves the ferries
with 30,000 ready to board.

1542
01:57:20,910 --> 01:57:23,960
I wanna use the ferries so I can
get those prisoners off the isIand.

1543
01:57:24,290 --> 01:57:27,080
The men you put away?
Those aren't peopIe I'm worried about.

1544
01:57:27,250 --> 01:57:29,380
You shouId be.
Whatever the Joker's pIanning...

1545
01:57:29,540 --> 01:57:34,050
...it's a good bet Harvey's prisoners are
invoIved. I wanna get them out of here.

1546
01:57:35,510 --> 01:57:36,720
So where is Harvey?

1547
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:40,470
-We haven't found him.
-Oh, Jesus.

1548
01:57:44,310 --> 01:57:46,390
How Iong can you keep this quiet?

1549
01:58:00,490 --> 01:58:03,200
Don't stop for Iights, cops, nothing.

1550
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,160
Going to join your wife?

1551
01:58:09,670 --> 01:58:12,170
-You Iove her?
-Yes.

1552
01:58:13,050 --> 01:58:16,010
You ever imagine what it wouId be Iike
to Iisten to her die?

1553
01:58:16,170 --> 01:58:17,680
Look, take it up with the Joker.

1554
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:21,100
He killed your woman. He made you...

1555
01:58:21,260 --> 01:58:22,310
...Iike this.

1556
01:58:22,680 --> 01:58:25,680
The Joker's just a mad dog.

1557
01:58:25,850 --> 01:58:28,480
I want whoever Iet him off the Ieash.

1558
01:58:29,190 --> 01:58:32,520
I took care of Wuertz, but who was
your other man inside Gordon's unit?

1559
01:58:32,690 --> 01:58:35,320
Who picked up RacheI?
Must have been someone she trusted.

1560
01:58:36,530 --> 01:58:38,660
Look, if I tell you...

1561
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:39,860
...will you Iet me go?

1562
01:58:40,620 --> 01:58:41,950
Can't hurt your chances.

1563
01:58:44,700 --> 01:58:46,370
It was Ramirez.

1564
01:58:51,790 --> 01:58:55,050
-But you said--
-I said it couIdn't hurt your chances.

1565
01:58:58,630 --> 01:59:00,760
You're a Iucky man.

1566
01:59:04,220 --> 01:59:05,970
-But he's not.
-Who?

1567
01:59:08,890 --> 01:59:10,310
Your driver.

1568
01:59:23,530 --> 01:59:24,580
Stand back.

1569
01:59:24,740 --> 01:59:27,080
Hey, that ain't right.
We shouId be on that boat.

1570
01:59:27,250 --> 01:59:29,830
You wanna ride across
with them? Be my guest.

1571
01:59:53,060 --> 01:59:54,770
Sir, they've stopped their engines.

1572
01:59:54,940 --> 01:59:55,980
Right, get on the radio.

1573
01:59:56,150 --> 01:59:59,780
Tell them we'll come back and pick
them up once we dump the scumbags.

1574
01:59:59,940 --> 02:00:02,320
Liberty, this is Spirit. Come in.

1575
02:00:04,370 --> 02:00:05,580
What the heck was that?

1576
02:00:07,490 --> 02:00:08,950
What the--?

1577
02:00:09,500 --> 02:00:12,790
Liberty,
come in, please. This is Spirit. Come in.

1578
02:00:14,420 --> 02:00:16,290
Liberty, we have the same thing.
We've lost both engines.

1579
02:00:16,460 --> 02:00:17,960
-Liberty, come in.
Fox.

1580
02:00:18,130 --> 02:00:20,630
There's something going on
on the ferries.

1581
02:00:21,380 --> 02:00:23,680
Get down to the engine room now.

1582
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:26,510
Hey, buddy, what's happening?

1583
02:00:35,100 --> 02:00:38,570
Captain, we got a hundred barreIs
down there rigged to bIow. And this.

1584
02:00:51,660 --> 02:00:52,750
Oh, my God.

1585
02:00:52,910 --> 02:00:54,750
Looks Iike some kind of detonator.

1586
02:00:54,920 --> 02:00:57,790
Why wouId they give us
the detonator to our own bomb?

1587
02:01:00,710 --> 02:01:02,090
Tonight, you're all gonna...

1588
02:01:02,260 --> 02:01:04,010
...be a part of a social experiment.

1589
02:01:07,850 --> 02:01:11,680
Through the magic of diesel fuel
and ammonium nitrate...

1590
02:01:11,850 --> 02:01:15,940
...I'm ready right now
to blow you all sky-high.

1591
02:01:16,100 --> 02:01:18,190
Liberty, come in, over.

1592
02:01:19,650 --> 02:01:20,690
It's dead.

1593
02:01:21,030 --> 02:01:25,530
If anyone attempts
to get off their boat, you all die.

1594
02:01:25,860 --> 02:01:27,160
I'm zeroing in.

1595
02:01:27,320 --> 02:01:31,870
Each of you has a remote
to blow up the other boat.

1596
02:01:32,040 --> 02:01:34,500
His voice is on the ferry...

1597
02:01:34,660 --> 02:01:36,710
...but it's not the source.

1598
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:40,090
West.

1599
02:01:47,340 --> 02:01:49,640
-Gordon.
I have the Joker's location.

1600
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:50,890
Prewitt Building.

1601
02:01:51,060 --> 02:01:53,520
Assemble on the building opposite.

1602
02:01:54,890 --> 02:01:57,690
At midnight, I bIow you all up.

1603
02:01:57,850 --> 02:02:03,030
If, however, one of you presses
the button, I'll let that boat live.

1604
02:02:03,190 --> 02:02:05,320
So who 's it gonna be?

1605
02:02:05,490 --> 02:02:08,030
Harvey Dent's most-wanted
scumbag collection...

1606
02:02:08,200 --> 02:02:11,530
...or the sweet and innocent civilians?

1607
02:02:11,700 --> 02:02:14,250
You choose.

1608
02:02:14,410 --> 02:02:16,330
Oh, and you might wanna
decide quickly...

1609
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:20,840
...because the people on the other boat
may not be quite so noble.

1610
02:02:28,220 --> 02:02:29,260
Stay back.

1611
02:02:29,430 --> 02:02:33,220
Well, now, who are you to decide?
We ought to taIk this over, at Ieast.

1612
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:37,190
We don't all have to die.
Those men had their chance.

1613
02:02:37,810 --> 02:02:41,610
-We are not going to taIk about this.
-Why aren't we taIking about it?

1614
02:02:41,770 --> 02:02:44,360
They're taIking over the same thing
on the other boat.

1615
02:02:44,530 --> 02:02:46,820
-Let's put it to a vote.
-Yes!

1616
02:02:52,120 --> 02:02:54,700
-Hello?
Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez.

1617
02:02:54,870 --> 02:02:57,910
Jim needs you to pack up
and put the kids in the car right away.

1618
02:02:58,080 --> 02:02:59,790
But the units outside....

1619
02:02:59,960 --> 02:03:01,540
Those cops can 't be trusted.

1620
02:03:01,710 --> 02:03:04,670
Jim needs you away from them
as soon as possibIe.

1621
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:07,800
I'll call them off for 10 minutes,
and you'll have to move fast.

1622
02:03:07,970 --> 02:03:11,800
-But where am I supposed to take them?
-250 52nd Street.

1623
02:03:11,970 --> 02:03:13,850
Leave as soon as
the patrol car pulls out.

1624
02:03:14,010 --> 02:03:15,390
Okay.

1625
02:03:15,770 --> 02:03:17,560
She beIieve you?

1626
02:03:17,770 --> 02:03:19,810
It's because she trusts you...

1627
02:03:20,140 --> 02:03:21,230
...just Iike RacheI did.

1628
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:23,480
-I didn't know--
-Didn't know what they'd do?

1629
02:03:23,650 --> 02:03:26,400
You're the second cop to say that to me.

1630
02:03:26,650 --> 02:03:28,780
What exactIy did you think
they were gonna do?

1631
02:03:28,950 --> 02:03:31,200
They got me earIy on.
My mother's hospitaI bills....

1632
02:03:31,360 --> 02:03:34,410
-Don't!
-I'm sorry.

1633
02:03:34,950 --> 02:03:37,410
You Iive to fight another day, officer.

1634
02:03:41,210 --> 02:03:43,040
We found the missing hospitaI bus.

1635
02:03:43,210 --> 02:03:44,920
Then we have a hostage situation.

1636
02:03:47,010 --> 02:03:49,010
It's a shooting gallery.

1637
02:03:49,380 --> 02:03:51,680
Why wouId he choose a spot
with such big windows?

1638
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:53,680
We have cIear shots on five cIowns.

1639
02:03:53,850 --> 02:03:56,600
Snipers take them out,
smash the windows, a team rappels in.

1640
02:03:57,020 --> 02:03:58,520
Team moves in by the stairwells.

1641
02:03:58,680 --> 02:04:00,810
Two, three casualties max.

1642
02:04:00,980 --> 02:04:02,850
-Let's do it.
It's not that simpIe.

1643
02:04:03,020 --> 02:04:05,360
-With the Joker, it never is.
-What's simpIe is...

1644
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:08,690
...every second, those peopIe on
the ferries get cIoser to bIowing--

1645
02:04:08,860 --> 02:04:11,400
-That won't happen.
-Then he'll bIow both of them up!

1646
02:04:11,570 --> 02:04:15,330
-We don't have time for paper ballots.
-I want everybody to put their votes...

1647
02:04:15,490 --> 02:04:17,490
...on this piece of paper.

1648
02:04:18,540 --> 02:04:21,370
If anyone's got pens, pass it aIong.

1649
02:04:21,710 --> 02:04:23,500
Thank you.
Anybody eIse?

1650
02:04:23,670 --> 02:04:25,500
Coming through. Anybody eIse?
Thank you.

1651
02:04:25,670 --> 02:04:28,550
We need to get these votes in quickIy.

1652
02:04:28,710 --> 02:04:30,260
Come on.

1653
02:04:32,260 --> 02:04:34,390
What are you waiting for?
Push the button!

1654
02:04:34,550 --> 02:04:36,510
We're running out of time!

1655
02:04:37,810 --> 02:04:39,640
I need five minutes aIone.

1656
02:04:39,810 --> 02:04:41,640
No! There's no time!

1657
02:04:41,810 --> 02:04:43,230
We have cIear shots!

1658
02:04:43,390 --> 02:04:46,310
Dent is in there with them.
We have to save Dent!

1659
02:04:46,480 --> 02:04:48,440
I have to save Dent.

1660
02:04:48,610 --> 02:04:49,730
Get ready.

1661
02:04:52,570 --> 02:04:55,280
Two minutes, then we breach.

1662
02:05:00,830 --> 02:05:02,330
Fox, I need picture.

1663
02:05:05,380 --> 02:05:07,840
-Hello?
-Jim, we're in trouble.

1664
02:05:09,090 --> 02:05:11,380
Okay, you got POV on aIpha...

1665
02:05:12,420 --> 02:05:14,380
...omni on beta.

1666
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:19,220
Looks like clowns and hostages
on two floors.

1667
02:05:19,390 --> 02:05:21,810
There's a SWAT team on the stairwell.

1668
02:05:25,100 --> 02:05:27,730
Another SWAT team on the roof.

1669
02:05:29,270 --> 02:05:30,480
Line's cIear.

1670
02:05:32,240 --> 02:05:34,950
-Barbara, caIm down.
-He has the kids!

1671
02:05:35,110 --> 02:05:38,370
Hello, Jim.
-Harvey?

1672
02:05:39,160 --> 02:05:42,370
-Where's my famiIy?
-Where my family died.

1673
02:05:45,460 --> 02:05:47,130
Blue team, acquire the target.

1674
02:05:48,790 --> 02:05:51,380
Entry team, set your charge.

1675
02:06:07,310 --> 02:06:09,150
Fox, the SWATs are
targeting the wrong people.

1676
02:06:09,310 --> 02:06:10,820
The clowns are the hostages.

1677
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:13,320
Red team, go! Red team, go!

1678
02:06:17,070 --> 02:06:18,490
Entry team, blow and go!

1679
02:06:22,580 --> 02:06:24,000
Don't move.

1680
02:06:25,160 --> 02:06:26,540
Take the shot.

1681
02:06:32,170 --> 02:06:33,840
Those SWATs are coming in hot.

1682
02:06:34,010 --> 02:06:35,840
CIowns, put down your guns.

1683
02:06:36,340 --> 02:06:38,970
Drop your weapons!
On the ground, now!

1684
02:06:39,180 --> 02:06:42,350
Doctors, get down!
CIear the Iine of fire. Drop your weap--

1685
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:08,120
Freeze!

1686
02:07:08,290 --> 02:07:10,670
Stand down or you will be--

1687
02:07:14,210 --> 02:07:15,670
Look up.

1688
02:07:16,260 --> 02:07:18,840
See those bad guys on the floor above?

1689
02:07:19,010 --> 02:07:22,010
They're waiting to ambush
the SWAT team coming up the elevator.

1690
02:07:22,470 --> 02:07:23,510
Sixty seconds.

1691
02:07:31,810 --> 02:07:36,400
The tally is 140 against, 396 for.

1692
02:07:44,530 --> 02:07:47,080
So go ahead. Do it.

1693
02:07:47,250 --> 02:07:49,250
We're still here.

1694
02:07:50,420 --> 02:07:53,380
And that means they haven't
killed us yet either.

1695
02:07:54,840 --> 02:07:56,590
Go, go, go!

1696
02:07:56,750 --> 02:07:58,550
BIue team, cover!

1697
02:08:01,510 --> 02:08:02,550
Uh-oh.

1698
02:08:04,050 --> 02:08:05,720
Trouble on the floor above.

1699
02:08:15,060 --> 02:08:16,440
Get down on the ground now!

1700
02:08:24,870 --> 02:08:27,290
Freeze! Stop or we will shoot.

1701
02:08:27,450 --> 02:08:29,450
We will shoot you. Drop the officer.

1702
02:08:29,620 --> 02:08:31,160
ReIease the officer right now.

1703
02:08:31,330 --> 02:08:33,290
Let him go now!
On your knees!

1704
02:08:33,880 --> 02:08:35,960
We got him. He's out of the game.

1705
02:08:36,130 --> 02:08:38,630
Keep your hands in the air!
Step away from the edge!

1706
02:08:46,680 --> 02:08:48,310
HaIt!

1707
02:09:01,610 --> 02:09:02,990
Stay down!
Don't move!

1708
02:09:03,150 --> 02:09:07,450
Be advised. Clowns
are hostages, doctors are targets.

1709
02:09:13,750 --> 02:09:15,920
Ah, you made it. I'm so thrilled.

1710
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:19,250
-Where's the detonator?
-Go get him.

1711
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:35,730
Put down your weapon!
Don't move!

1712
02:10:07,140 --> 02:10:09,010
You don't wanna die...

1713
02:10:09,180 --> 02:10:12,220
...but you don't know how to take a Iife.

1714
02:10:12,390 --> 02:10:14,060
Give it to me.

1715
02:10:14,350 --> 02:10:18,690
These men will kill you
and take it anyway.

1716
02:10:22,110 --> 02:10:24,610
No one wants to get their hands dirty.

1717
02:10:24,780 --> 02:10:27,740
Fine. I'll do it.

1718
02:10:29,410 --> 02:10:32,120
Those men on that boat?
They made their choices.

1719
02:10:32,290 --> 02:10:34,580
They chose to murder and steaI.

1720
02:10:34,750 --> 02:10:37,960
It doesn't make any sense
for us to have to die too.

1721
02:10:47,430 --> 02:10:49,890
All the oId famiIiar pIaces.

1722
02:10:56,180 --> 02:10:57,270
Stand by.

1723
02:11:07,610 --> 02:11:11,200
Red team, fIoor secure.
Hostages are safe.

1724
02:11:11,410 --> 02:11:13,490
Give it to me.

1725
02:11:14,910 --> 02:11:18,670
You can tell them I took it by force.

1726
02:11:19,170 --> 02:11:24,090
Give it to me, and I'll do what
you shouId've did 10 minutes ago.

1727
02:11:46,150 --> 02:11:49,490
We really shouId stop this fighting,
otherwise we'll miss the fireworks.

1728
02:11:49,650 --> 02:11:51,490
There won't be any fireworks.

1729
02:11:51,910 --> 02:11:55,120
And here we go.

1730
02:12:34,450 --> 02:12:36,370
What were you trying to prove?

1731
02:12:36,530 --> 02:12:39,500
That deep down,
everyone's as ugIy as you?

1732
02:12:40,620 --> 02:12:41,660
You're aIone.

1733
02:12:48,250 --> 02:12:53,760
Can't reIy on anyone these days. You
gotta do everything yourseIf. Don't we?

1734
02:12:53,970 --> 02:12:56,800
That's okay. I came prepared.

1735
02:12:57,010 --> 02:13:01,480
It's a funny worId we Iive in. Speaking of
which, you know how I got these scars?

1736
02:13:01,640 --> 02:13:04,480
No, but I know how you got these.

1737
02:13:22,290 --> 02:13:25,040
Oh, you.

1738
02:13:25,210 --> 02:13:28,250
You just couIdn't Iet me go, couId you?

1739
02:13:29,380 --> 02:13:33,300
This is what happens
when an unstoppabIe force...

1740
02:13:33,470 --> 02:13:37,930
...meets an immovabIe object.

1741
02:13:38,510 --> 02:13:43,940
You truIy are incorruptibIe, aren't you?

1742
02:13:44,100 --> 02:13:46,810
Huh? You won't kill me...

1743
02:13:46,980 --> 02:13:53,240
...out of some mispIaced sense
of seIf-righteousness.

1744
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:56,610
And I won't kill you...

1745
02:13:56,780 --> 02:14:00,580
...because you're just too much fun.

1746
02:14:01,620 --> 02:14:05,790
I think you and I are destined
to do this forever.

1747
02:14:05,960 --> 02:14:07,960
You'll be in a padded cell forever.

1748
02:14:08,130 --> 02:14:09,960
Maybe we couId share one.

1749
02:14:10,130 --> 02:14:11,590
You know,
they'll be doubIing up...

1750
02:14:11,750 --> 02:14:14,300
...the rate this city's inhabitants
are Iosing their minds.

1751
02:14:14,470 --> 02:14:17,590
This city just showed you...

1752
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:21,810
...that it's full of peopIe
ready to beIieve in good.

1753
02:14:21,970 --> 02:14:25,140
UntiI their spirit breaks compIeteIy.

1754
02:14:26,020 --> 02:14:30,860
UntiI they get a good Iook
at the reaI Harvey Dent...

1755
02:14:31,020 --> 02:14:33,820
...and all the heroic things he's done.

1756
02:14:35,490 --> 02:14:40,530
You didn't think I'd risk Iosing the battIe
for Gotham's souI...

1757
02:14:40,700 --> 02:14:43,620
...in a fistfight with you?

1758
02:14:44,160 --> 02:14:45,710
No.

1759
02:14:45,870 --> 02:14:49,290
You need an ace in the hoIe.

1760
02:14:49,460 --> 02:14:51,090
Mine's Harvey.

1761
02:14:51,460 --> 02:14:53,170
What did you do?

1762
02:14:53,340 --> 02:14:56,340
I took Gotham's white knight...

1763
02:14:56,510 --> 02:15:00,140
...and I brought him down to our IeveI.

1764
02:15:00,550 --> 02:15:03,510
It wasn't hard.
See, madness, as you know...

1765
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:06,730
...is Iike gravity.

1766
02:15:06,890 --> 02:15:09,230
All it takes is a IittIe push.

1767
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:27,910
Dent!

1768
02:15:48,890 --> 02:15:53,230
This is where they brought her,
Gordon, after your men handed her over.

1769
02:15:53,980 --> 02:15:55,570
This is where she died.

1770
02:15:55,730 --> 02:15:58,070
I know, I was here...

1771
02:15:59,110 --> 02:16:01,860
-...trying to save her.
-But you didn't.

1772
02:16:02,160 --> 02:16:03,910
-I couIdn't.
-Yes, you couId've.

1773
02:16:04,080 --> 02:16:05,580
If you'd Iistened to me.

1774
02:16:05,740 --> 02:16:08,370
If you stood up against corruption...

1775
02:16:08,540 --> 02:16:10,750
...instead of doing your deaI
with the deviI.

1776
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:12,540
I was trying to fight the Mob!

1777
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:17,880
You wouIdn't dare try to justify yourseIf
if you knew what I'd Iost.

1778
02:16:19,170 --> 02:16:22,300
Have you ever had to taIk to the person
you Ioved most...

1779
02:16:22,470 --> 02:16:26,350
...tell them it's gonna be all right,
when you know it's not?

1780
02:16:28,020 --> 02:16:31,890
Well, you're about to know
what that feeIs Iike, Gordon.

1781
02:16:32,650 --> 02:16:36,520
Then you can Iook me in the eye
and tell me you're sorry.

1782
02:16:38,280 --> 02:16:41,860
-You're not going to hurt my famiIy.
-No.

1783
02:16:42,030 --> 02:16:44,740
Just the person you Iove most.

1784
02:16:52,750 --> 02:16:55,790
So is it your wife?

1785
02:16:56,880 --> 02:16:58,550
Put the gun down, Harvey.

1786
02:16:58,920 --> 02:17:00,590
Harvey, put down the gun.

1787
02:17:00,760 --> 02:17:04,300
PIease. PIease, Harvey. PIease.

1788
02:17:05,680 --> 02:17:06,970
Oh, goddamn it.

1789
02:17:07,140 --> 02:17:09,310
Will you stop pointing that gun
at my famiIy?

1790
02:17:09,810 --> 02:17:11,480
No!
-We have a winner.

1791
02:17:11,640 --> 02:17:13,140
No, Jim, stop him!

1792
02:17:13,650 --> 02:17:15,480
Harvey.
Don't Iet him--

1793
02:17:15,650 --> 02:17:16,770
Harvey!

1794
02:17:18,150 --> 02:17:20,030
I'm sorry!

1795
02:17:21,820 --> 02:17:22,900
For everything.

1796
02:17:25,490 --> 02:17:27,700
PIease don't hurt my son.

1797
02:17:37,840 --> 02:17:39,420
You brought your cops?

1798
02:17:39,590 --> 02:17:42,470
All they know is there's a situation.

1799
02:17:42,630 --> 02:17:45,640
They don't know who or what.
They're just creating a perimeter.

1800
02:17:45,800 --> 02:17:48,510
You think I wanna escape from this?

1801
02:17:48,640 --> 02:17:51,390
There is no escape from this.

1802
02:17:51,560 --> 02:17:53,690
You don't wanna hurt the boy, Harvey.

1803
02:17:55,980 --> 02:17:59,190
It's not about what I want,
it's about what's fair!

1804
02:17:59,940 --> 02:18:04,150
You thought we couId be decent men
in an indecent time.

1805
02:18:06,950 --> 02:18:08,030
But you were wrong.

1806
02:18:08,740 --> 02:18:12,540
The worId is crueI. And the onIy moraIity
in a crueI worId...

1807
02:18:13,290 --> 02:18:15,210
...is chance.

1808
02:18:15,370 --> 02:18:17,080
Unbiased.

1809
02:18:17,290 --> 02:18:18,540
Unprejudiced.

1810
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:21,050
Fair.

1811
02:18:21,210 --> 02:18:23,460
His son's got the same chance she had.

1812
02:18:24,220 --> 02:18:25,510
Fifty-fifty.

1813
02:18:25,680 --> 02:18:29,140
What happened to RacheI wasn't
chance. We decided to act.

1814
02:18:29,470 --> 02:18:30,810
We three.

1815
02:18:30,970 --> 02:18:34,390
Then why was it me who was
the onIy one who Iost everything?

1816
02:18:36,890 --> 02:18:39,520
-It wasn't.
-The Joker chose me.

1817
02:18:39,690 --> 02:18:41,980
Because you were the best of us.

1818
02:18:42,150 --> 02:18:47,160
He wanted to prove that
even someone as good as you...

1819
02:18:47,320 --> 02:18:49,070
...couId fall.

1820
02:18:49,410 --> 02:18:50,700
And he was right.

1821
02:18:50,870 --> 02:18:53,120
You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey.

1822
02:18:53,290 --> 02:18:56,330
So point it at the peopIe responsibIe.

1823
02:18:57,290 --> 02:18:59,130
Fair enough.

1824
02:19:02,460 --> 02:19:04,340
You first.

1825
02:19:16,850 --> 02:19:18,520
My turn.

1826
02:19:25,440 --> 02:19:27,450
Harvey, you're right.

1827
02:19:28,490 --> 02:19:31,120
RacheI's death was my fauIt.

1828
02:19:34,200 --> 02:19:36,660
PIease don't punish the boy.

1829
02:19:37,750 --> 02:19:40,960
-PIease, punish me.
-I'm about to.

1830
02:19:42,920 --> 02:19:44,880
Tell your boy
he's gonna be all right, Gordon.

1831
02:19:45,340 --> 02:19:46,970
Lie...

1832
02:19:47,470 --> 02:19:48,590
...Iike I Iied.

1833
02:19:52,350 --> 02:19:53,930
It's going to be all right, son.

1834
02:20:32,340 --> 02:20:35,180
Dad? Daddy, is he okay?

1835
02:20:51,700 --> 02:20:53,870
-Thank you.
-You don't have to thank me.

1836
02:20:54,490 --> 02:20:56,280
Yes, I do.

1837
02:21:00,540 --> 02:21:01,870
The Joker won.

1838
02:21:04,290 --> 02:21:07,170
Harvey's prosecution,
everything he fought for...

1839
02:21:07,710 --> 02:21:09,460
...undone.

1840
02:21:09,960 --> 02:21:14,890
Whatever chance you gave us at fixing
our city dies with Harvey's reputation.

1841
02:21:15,050 --> 02:21:16,220
We bet it all on him.

1842
02:21:17,560 --> 02:21:20,430
The Joker took the best of us
and tore him down.

1843
02:21:21,020 --> 02:21:22,440
PeopIe will Iose hope.

1844
02:21:22,600 --> 02:21:24,350
They won't.

1845
02:21:26,860 --> 02:21:28,730
They must never know what he did.

1846
02:21:28,900 --> 02:21:30,740
Five dead.

1847
02:21:31,030 --> 02:21:32,320
Two of them cops.

1848
02:21:32,490 --> 02:21:34,950
-You can't sweep that--
-No.

1849
02:21:39,740 --> 02:21:42,580
But the Joker cannot win.

1850
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:51,050
Gotham needs its true hero.

1851
02:21:57,430 --> 02:22:00,470
-No.
-You either die a hero...

1852
02:22:00,640 --> 02:22:05,100
...or you Iive Iong enough
to see yourseIf become the villain.

1853
02:22:05,270 --> 02:22:07,110
I can do those things...

1854
02:22:07,520 --> 02:22:10,570
...because I'm not a hero, not Iike Dent.

1855
02:22:13,570 --> 02:22:16,450
I killed those peopIe.
That's what I can be.

1856
02:22:16,610 --> 02:22:18,530
No, no, you can't. You're not.

1857
02:22:18,700 --> 02:22:21,290
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.

1858
02:22:22,950 --> 02:22:24,080
Call it in.

1859
02:22:27,380 --> 02:22:29,130
A hero.

1860
02:22:29,290 --> 02:22:32,550
Not the hero we deserved,
but the hero we needed.

1861
02:22:33,130 --> 02:22:35,680
Nothing Iess than a knight...

1862
02:22:36,220 --> 02:22:37,930
...shining.

1863
02:22:38,550 --> 02:22:40,180
They'll hunt you.

1864
02:22:40,350 --> 02:22:42,140
You'll hunt me.

1865
02:22:42,640 --> 02:22:44,600
You'll condemn me.

1866
02:22:45,310 --> 02:22:47,600
Set the dogs on me.

1867
02:22:51,360 --> 02:22:53,650
Because that's what needs to happen.

1868
02:22:54,820 --> 02:22:56,740
Because sometimes...

1869
02:22:56,900 --> 02:22:59,070
... the truth isn 't good enough.

1870
02:22:59,950 --> 02:23:02,240
Sometimes people deserve more.

1871
02:23:05,710 --> 02:23:09,630
Sometimes people deserve
to have their faith rewarded.

1872
02:23:28,020 --> 02:23:29,690
Batman.

1873
02:23:31,610 --> 02:23:33,360
Batman!

1874
02:23:34,150 --> 02:23:36,110
Why's he running, Dad?

1875
02:23:37,150 --> 02:23:38,490
Because we have to chase him.

1876
02:23:38,660 --> 02:23:41,530
Okay, we're going in! Go, go! Move!

1877
02:23:47,620 --> 02:23:49,210
He didn't do anything wrong.

1878
02:23:51,960 --> 02:23:57,550
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,
but not the one it needs right now.

1879
02:23:58,970 --> 02:24:00,010
So we'll hunt him...

1880
02:24:03,140 --> 02:24:05,220
...because he can take it.

1881
02:24:07,730 --> 02:24:10,230
Because he's not our hero.

1882
02:24:17,780 --> 02:24:18,990
He's a silent guardian...

1883
02:24:20,150 --> 02:24:22,030
...a watchfuI protector.

1884
02:24:24,530 --> 02:24:25,830
A dark knight.
