1
00:01:45,096 --> 00:01:47,932
GRUMPY: Three of a kind, let's do this.
CHUCKLES: That's it? Three guys?

2
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:51,435
GRUMPY: Two guys on the roof. Every
guy gets a share. Five shares is plenty.

3
00:01:51,602 --> 00:01:54,063
CHUCKLES: Six shares. Don't
forget the guy who planned the job.

4
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,524
GRUMPY: He thinks he can sit it out
and still take a slice.

5
00:01:56,691 --> 00:01:59,819
- I know why they call him the Joker.
HAPPY: Why do they call him the Joker?

6
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:01,821
DOPEY: I heard he wears makeup.
HAPPY: Makeup?

7
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,948
DOPEY: Yeah, to scare people.
You know, war paint.

8
00:02:16,502 --> 00:02:19,714
GRUMPY: All right, everybody,
hands up, heads down!

9
00:02:20,089 --> 00:02:22,884
I said, hands up, heads down!

10
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,012
Let's go, pal,
I'm making a withdrawal here.

11
00:02:26,262 --> 00:02:27,722
- I said, hands up!
- No!

12
00:02:28,097 --> 00:02:30,349
DOPEY:
Here comes the silent alarm.

13
00:02:30,516 --> 00:02:31,851
And there it goes.

14
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,227
GRUMPY:
Heads down!

15
00:02:33,394 --> 00:02:35,730
All right, tootsie,
you're taking a dive with me.

16
00:02:35,897 --> 00:02:38,566
- Down! I said, stay down there!
WOMAN: Don't hurt me!

17
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:41,819
DOPEY: Funny, it didn't dial 911.
It was trying to reach a private number.

18
00:02:41,986 --> 00:02:43,905
HAPPY: Is it a problem?
DOPEY: No, I'm done here.

19
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:55,666
GRUMPY:
Sit down! Down!

20
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:58,336
Down! I said, stay down there!

21
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,426
GRUMPY: Obviously we don't want you
doing anything with your hands...

22
00:03:05,593 --> 00:03:08,513
...other than holding on for dear life.

23
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,272
CHUCKLES:
On the ground! Stay on the ground!

24
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:22,109
Nobody make a move!
Nobody! Stay down!

25
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:44,507
You have any idea
who you're stealing from?

26
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:48,386
- You and your friends are dead.
GRUMPY: He's out, right?

27
00:03:51,472 --> 00:03:52,723
GRUMPY:
What...?

28
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:02,320
Where did you learn to count?

29
00:04:05,115 --> 00:04:07,159
HAPPY: They wired this thing up
with like 5000 volts.

30
00:04:07,325 --> 00:04:08,577
What kind of bank does that?

31
00:04:08,743 --> 00:04:11,788
GRUMPY: A Mob bank.
I guess the Joker's as crazy as they say.

32
00:04:11,955 --> 00:04:12,998
Where's the alarm guy?

33
00:04:13,165 --> 00:04:15,667
HAPPY: Boss told me when the guy
was done, I should take him out.

34
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:17,169
One less share, right?

35
00:04:18,086 --> 00:04:20,338
GRUMPY:
Funny, he told me something similar.

36
00:04:20,505 --> 00:04:21,965
HAPPY:
He what? No! No!

37
00:04:33,685 --> 00:04:35,061
GRUMPY:
That's a lot of money.

38
00:04:35,228 --> 00:04:38,940
If this Joker guy was so smart,
he'd have had us bring a bigger car.

39
00:04:40,358 --> 00:04:44,279
I'm betting the Joker told you to kill me
soon as we loaded the cash.

40
00:04:45,197 --> 00:04:48,992
BOZO:
No, no, no, I kill the bus driver.

41
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:50,827
GRUMPY:
Bus driver?

42
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:54,539
What bus driver?

43
00:04:58,627 --> 00:05:00,545
DRIVER:
School's out. Time to go.

44
00:05:00,712 --> 00:05:02,964
That guy's not getting up, is he?

45
00:05:03,715 --> 00:05:05,383
That's a lot of money.

46
00:05:08,887 --> 00:05:11,223
What happened to the rest of the guys?

47
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:20,357
MANAGER:
You think you're smart, huh?

48
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:22,692
The guy that hired youse...

49
00:05:23,235 --> 00:05:25,821
...he'll just do the same to you.

50
00:05:26,112 --> 00:05:29,074
Oh, criminals in this town
used to believe in things.

51
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:30,534
Honor...

52
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,410
...respect.

53
00:05:32,577 --> 00:05:34,913
Look at you.
What do you believe in, huh?

54
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,373
What do you believe in?!

55
00:05:36,706 --> 00:05:41,628
I believe whatever doesn't kill you
simply makes you...

56
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:44,756
...stranger.

57
00:06:26,715 --> 00:06:29,634
MAN 1: Mr. Mayor, you were elected
in a campaign to clean up the city.

58
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:31,970
- When are you gonna start?
MAN 2: I already have.

59
00:06:32,137 --> 00:06:33,221
MAN 1: Like this Batman.

60
00:06:33,388 --> 00:06:35,974
We're hearing he's doing good,
criminals are running scared.

61
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:39,853
- No, man. I don't like it tonight.
- What are you, superstitious?

62
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,106
You got more chance of winning
the Powerball than running into him.

63
00:06:43,273 --> 00:06:46,651
That's not true. Our men in the
Major Crimes Unit are close to an arrest.

64
00:06:46,818 --> 00:06:49,779
Hey, Wuertz, mayor says
you're closing in on the Batman.

65
00:06:49,946 --> 00:06:52,073
The investigation is ongoing.

66
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,659
MAYOR: The process of cleaning up
the streets is a long one.

67
00:06:54,826 --> 00:06:56,828
I pledged in my campaign, uh, to have...

68
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,460
Ever intending to see your wife again,
lieutenant?

69
00:07:03,627 --> 00:07:06,296
I thought you had to
go look after your mother, detective.

70
00:07:06,463 --> 00:07:08,423
Checked her back into the hospital.

71
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:10,509
I'm sorry.

72
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:14,304
- So he hasn't shown up?
- He often doesn't.

73
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:16,389
I like reminding everybody
he's out there.

74
00:07:16,556 --> 00:07:17,849
Why wouldn't he come?

75
00:07:18,183 --> 00:07:20,018
Hopefully...

76
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:22,062
...because he's busy.

77
00:07:38,787 --> 00:07:41,706
That's why we bring dogs.

78
00:07:41,873 --> 00:07:44,209
- My little princes.
MAN: Please.

79
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:47,963
Please, they're crawling in my mouth.
Please, I beg you, get them off.

80
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,882
CHECHEN: Look what your drugs
do to my customers.

81
00:07:51,049 --> 00:07:52,676
SCARECROW:
Buyer beware.

82
00:07:52,843 --> 00:07:56,054
I told you my compound
would take you places.

83
00:07:56,221 --> 00:07:58,974
I never said they'd be places
you wanted to go.

84
00:07:59,141 --> 00:08:01,685
My business, repeat customers.

85
00:08:01,852 --> 00:08:03,562
SCARECROW: You don't like
what I have to offer...

86
00:08:03,728 --> 00:08:05,480
...you can buy from someone else.

87
00:08:05,647 --> 00:08:08,400
Assuming Batman left anyone
to buy from.

88
00:08:11,736 --> 00:08:15,740
My dogs are hungry.

89
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:21,746
Pity there's only one of you.

90
00:08:29,713 --> 00:08:31,381
CHECHEN: What...?
SCARECROW: That's not him.

91
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,512
Loose the dogs!

92
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:51,776
SCARECROW:
That's more like it.

93
00:10:19,865 --> 00:10:21,616
Don't let me find you out here again.

94
00:10:21,783 --> 00:10:24,619
- We're trying to help you.
BATMAN: I don't need help.

95
00:10:24,786 --> 00:10:26,121
Not my diagnosis.

96
00:10:26,288 --> 00:10:29,875
What gives you the right? What's
the difference between you and me?

97
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,919
I'm not wearing hockey pads.

98
00:10:36,423 --> 00:10:38,383
OFFICER:
Everybody back now!

99
00:10:40,552 --> 00:10:43,722
He can't resist showing us his face.

100
00:10:47,976 --> 00:10:50,145
GORDON:
What's he hiding under that makeup?

101
00:10:57,861 --> 00:11:00,530
RAMIREZ: Uh, can we get a minute,
people, please?

102
00:11:03,158 --> 00:11:05,327
Him again. Who are the others?

103
00:11:05,494 --> 00:11:07,078
Another bunch of smalltimers.

104
00:11:08,455 --> 00:11:10,165
BATMAN:
Some of the marked bills I gave you.

105
00:11:10,332 --> 00:11:12,626
My detectives have been
making drug buys with them.

106
00:11:12,793 --> 00:11:15,378
This bank was another drop for the Mob.
That makes five.

107
00:11:15,545 --> 00:11:18,131
- We found the bulk of their dirty cash.
- Time to move in.

108
00:11:18,298 --> 00:11:22,093
We'd have to hit all banks
simultaneously. SWAT teams, backup.

109
00:11:22,427 --> 00:11:24,095
What about this Joker guy?

110
00:11:24,262 --> 00:11:27,224
One man or the entire Mob? He can wait.

111
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,726
When the new DA hears about this,
he'll want in.

112
00:11:29,893 --> 00:11:32,437
- Do you trust him?
- Be hard to keep him out.

113
00:11:32,604 --> 00:11:36,066
I hear he's as stubborn as you are.

114
00:12:19,609 --> 00:12:22,571
ALFRED:
Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt.

115
00:12:22,737 --> 00:12:25,448
You can swap
not sleeping in a penthouse...

116
00:12:25,615 --> 00:12:27,159
...for not sleeping in a mansion.

117
00:12:27,325 --> 00:12:31,079
Whenever you stitch yourself up,
you do make a bloody mess.

118
00:12:31,246 --> 00:12:34,249
Yeah. It makes me learn
from my mistakes.

119
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:37,836
You ought to be pretty knowledgeable
by now, then.

120
00:12:39,546 --> 00:12:40,589
My armor.

121
00:12:40,755 --> 00:12:44,342
I'm carrying too much weight.
I need to be... I need to be faster.

122
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:47,179
I'm sure Mr. Fox can oblige.

123
00:12:47,345 --> 00:12:49,848
- Did you get mauled by a tiger?
- It was a dog.

124
00:12:50,015 --> 00:12:52,559
- Huh?
- It was a big dog.

125
00:12:52,726 --> 00:12:56,605
There were more copycats last night,
Alfred, with guns.

126
00:12:56,771 --> 00:12:58,690
Why not hire them,
take the weekend off?

127
00:12:58,857 --> 00:13:01,693
That wasn't exactly
what I had in mind...

128
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,612
...when I said I wanted
to inspire people.

129
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:05,697
I know.

130
00:13:05,864 --> 00:13:07,365
But things have improved.

131
00:13:07,574 --> 00:13:10,035
Look at the new district attorney.

132
00:13:10,702 --> 00:13:12,704
BRUCE:
I am, closely.

133
00:13:12,871 --> 00:13:14,790
Need to know if he can be trusted.

134
00:13:14,956 --> 00:13:19,002
Are you interested in his character
or his social circle?

135
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:25,217
Who Rachel spends her time with
is her business.

136
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,262
I trust you don't have me followed
on my day off.

137
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:31,515
If you ever took one, I might.

138
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,227
Know your limits, Master Wayne.

139
00:13:35,393 --> 00:13:38,522
Batman has no limits.

140
00:13:38,688 --> 00:13:41,733
- Well, you do, sir.
- Well, can't afford to know them.

141
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,402
And what's gonna happen
on the day that you find out?

142
00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:47,280
We all know how much you like to say
"I told you so."

143
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:50,784
On that day, Master Wayne,
even I won't want to.

144
00:13:50,951 --> 00:13:52,410
Probably.

145
00:13:59,251 --> 00:14:00,919
MAN:
Sorry I'm late, folks.

146
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,050
- Where were you?
- Worried you'd have to step up?

147
00:14:07,217 --> 00:14:10,220
- Harvey, I know these briefs backwards.
- Well, then...

148
00:14:10,387 --> 00:14:12,389
...fair's fair.

149
00:14:12,556 --> 00:14:14,599
Heads, I'll take it. Tails, he's all yours.

150
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:16,852
Yeah? You wanna
flip a coin to see who leads?

151
00:14:17,018 --> 00:14:20,438
My father's lucky coin. As I recall,
it got me my first date with you.

152
00:14:20,605 --> 00:14:23,775
I wouldn't leave something like that
up to chance.

153
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:27,195
I don't. I make my own luck.

154
00:14:28,697 --> 00:14:32,742
BAILIFF: All rise.
The Honorable Judge Freel presiding.

155
00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:35,579
I thought the DA just
played golf with the mayor.

156
00:14:35,745 --> 00:14:39,458
Teeoff's 1:30. More than enough time
to put you away for life, Sally.

157
00:14:39,624 --> 00:14:41,168
With Carmine Falcone in Arkham...

158
00:14:41,334 --> 00:14:44,337
...someone must have stepped up
to run the so-called family.

159
00:14:45,213 --> 00:14:47,466
Is that man in this courtroom today?

160
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:52,637
- Could you identify him for us, please?
- You win, counselor.

161
00:14:54,973 --> 00:14:56,475
It was me.

162
00:14:58,185 --> 00:15:01,980
I have a sworn statement from you
that this man...

163
00:15:02,147 --> 00:15:05,859
...Salvatore Maroni, is the new head
of the Falcone crime family.

164
00:15:06,026 --> 00:15:10,155
Maroni? He's a fall guy.
I'm the brains of the organization.

165
00:15:11,531 --> 00:15:13,074
JUDGE: Order.
- Permission to treat...

166
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:14,493
...the witness as hostile?
- Granted.

167
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:15,702
- Hostile? I'll show you hostile!

168
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:24,669
Carbon fiber, .28 caliber,
made in China.

169
00:15:24,836 --> 00:15:26,379
If you wanna kill a
public servant, Mr. Maroni...

170
00:15:26,546 --> 00:15:28,757
...I recommend you buy American.

171
00:15:29,674 --> 00:15:32,302
JUDGE: Get him out of here.
- But, Your Honor, I'm not done.

172
00:15:36,014 --> 00:15:39,309
We'll never be able to link the gun
to Maroni, so we can't charge him.

173
00:15:39,476 --> 00:15:42,270
But they're trying to kill you,
means we're getting to them.

174
00:15:42,437 --> 00:15:45,565
I'm glad you're so pleased, Rachel.
I'm fine, by the way.

175
00:15:45,732 --> 00:15:47,442
Come on, Harvey. You're Gotham's DA.

176
00:15:47,609 --> 00:15:50,445
You're not getting shot at,
you're not doing your job right.

177
00:15:50,612 --> 00:15:51,822
But, you know...

178
00:15:51,988 --> 00:15:55,325
...if you said you were rattled,
we could take the rest of the day off.

179
00:15:55,492 --> 00:15:58,411
Can't. I dragged the head of
the Major Crimes Unit down here.

180
00:15:58,578 --> 00:16:03,333
Oh, Jim Gordon? He's a friend, actually.
Try to be nice.

181
00:16:12,384 --> 00:16:15,178
I hear you got a hell of a right cross.

182
00:16:18,473 --> 00:16:20,600
It's a shame Sal's going to walk.

183
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:24,813
Yeah, well, good thing about the Mob
is they keep giving you second chances.

184
00:16:29,985 --> 00:16:32,320
Lightly irradiated bills.

185
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:35,073
Fancy stuff for a city cop. Have help?

186
00:16:35,532 --> 00:16:37,242
We liaise with various agencies...

187
00:16:37,409 --> 00:16:39,161
Save it, Gordon. I wanna meet him.

188
00:16:39,327 --> 00:16:42,914
Official policy is to arrest the vigilante
known as Batman on sight.

189
00:16:43,081 --> 00:16:45,250
Mm-hm. What about that floodlight
on the top of MCU?

190
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:47,836
If you got problems
with malfunctioning equipment...

191
00:16:48,003 --> 00:16:51,214
...I suggest you take them up
with Maintenance, counselor.

192
00:16:51,506 --> 00:16:54,050
I've put every money launderer
in Gotham behind bars...

193
00:16:54,217 --> 00:16:56,595
...but the Mob
is still getting its money out.

194
00:16:56,761 --> 00:17:00,223
I think you and your friend
have found the last game in town.

195
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:03,101
You're trying to hit them
where it hurts, their wallets.

196
00:17:03,268 --> 00:17:04,436
It's bold.

197
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:06,521
You gonna count me in?

198
00:17:07,063 --> 00:17:10,442
In this town, the fewer people know
something, the safer the operation.

199
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:12,861
I don't like that you got
your own special unit...

200
00:17:13,028 --> 00:17:15,947
...and it's full of cops
I investigated at Internal Affairs.

201
00:17:16,114 --> 00:17:18,950
If I didn't work with cops
you'd investigated while at IA...

202
00:17:19,117 --> 00:17:20,368
...I'd be working alone.

203
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,038
I don't get political points
for being an idealist.

204
00:17:23,205 --> 00:17:25,624
I do the best I can with what I have.

205
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:32,964
You want me to back warrants
for search and seizure on five banks...

206
00:17:33,131 --> 00:17:34,966
...without telling me what we're after.

207
00:17:36,051 --> 00:17:38,637
I can give you the names of the banks.

208
00:17:38,804 --> 00:17:40,722
Well, that's a start.

209
00:17:41,097 --> 00:17:43,433
I'll get you your warrants,
but I want your trust.

210
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,268
Oh, you don't have
to sell me, Dent.

211
00:17:45,435 --> 00:17:47,437
We all know you're Gotham's
white knight.

212
00:17:48,688 --> 00:17:52,150
Yeah, well, I heard they have
a different name for me down at MCU.

213
00:17:52,734 --> 00:17:54,027
I wouldn't know about that.

214
00:17:55,195 --> 00:17:58,990
MAN: In China, Lau Security Investments
stands for dynamic new growth.

215
00:17:59,157 --> 00:18:03,453
A joint Chinese venture with
Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.

216
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,539
FOX:
Well, Mr. Lau...

217
00:18:05,914 --> 00:18:08,667
...I speak for the rest of the board...

218
00:18:09,251 --> 00:18:12,170
...and Mr. Wayne,
in expressing our own excitement.

219
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:20,679
Sir, I know Mr. Wayne is curious about
how his trust fund gets replenished...

220
00:18:20,846 --> 00:18:23,348
...but, frankly, this is embarrassing.

221
00:18:23,515 --> 00:18:26,101
You worry about the diligence,
Mr. Reese.

222
00:18:26,268 --> 00:18:28,562
I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.

223
00:18:28,728 --> 00:18:30,272
It's done.

224
00:18:30,438 --> 00:18:32,190
The numbers are solid.

225
00:18:32,357 --> 00:18:33,900
Do them again.

226
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:37,154
Wouldn't want the trust fund to run out,
now, would we?

227
00:18:39,865 --> 00:18:41,491
FOX:
Another long night?

228
00:18:41,658 --> 00:18:44,619
This joint venture was your idea,
and the consultants love it.

229
00:18:45,287 --> 00:18:46,538
But I'm not convinced.

230
00:18:46,705 --> 00:18:50,375
Lau's company has grown by
8 percent annually like clockwork.

231
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:52,961
His revenue stream
must be off the books...

232
00:18:53,128 --> 00:18:54,546
...maybe even illegal.

233
00:18:54,713 --> 00:18:56,381
Okay. Cancel the deal.

234
00:18:57,716 --> 00:18:58,884
You already knew.

235
00:18:59,593 --> 00:19:02,137
Just needed a closer look at their books.

236
00:19:02,304 --> 00:19:04,347
Anything else you can trouble me for?

237
00:19:04,806 --> 00:19:06,349
I need a new suit.

238
00:19:06,516 --> 00:19:09,019
Yeah. Three buttons
is a little '90s, Mr. Wayne.

239
00:19:09,186 --> 00:19:12,314
I'm not talking fashion, Mr. Fox,
so much as function.

240
00:19:13,356 --> 00:19:15,066
You wanna be able to turn your head.

241
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:17,319
Sure make backing out
of the driveway easier.

242
00:19:17,777 --> 00:19:19,321
I'll see what I can do.

243
00:19:24,075 --> 00:19:26,036
Took three weeks
to get a reservation here.

244
00:19:26,203 --> 00:19:28,330
I had to tell them
I work for the government.

245
00:19:28,497 --> 00:19:29,748
- Really?
- Health inspector's...

246
00:19:29,915 --> 00:19:31,166
...not afraid to pull strings.

247
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,543
Rachel. Fancy that.

248
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,213
Yeah, Bruce. Fancy that.

249
00:19:36,546 --> 00:19:38,715
Rachel, Natascha. Natascha, Rachel.

250
00:19:38,882 --> 00:19:44,262
- Natascha. Are you the prima...?
- Prima ballerina for the Moscow Ballet.

251
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:47,766
- Wow. Harvey's taking me next week.
- Really? So you're into ballet?

252
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:50,268
Bruce. This is Harvey Dent.

253
00:19:50,602 --> 00:19:54,356
The famous Bruce Wayne.
Rachel's told me everything about you.

254
00:19:54,523 --> 00:19:55,732
I certainly hope not.

255
00:19:56,066 --> 00:19:59,402
- Let's put a couple tables together.
- I'm not sure that they'll let us.

256
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:02,614
Oh, they should. I own the place.

257
00:20:03,073 --> 00:20:06,034
How could you want to raise children
in a city like this?

258
00:20:06,201 --> 00:20:08,161
Well, I was raised here.
I turned out okay.

259
00:20:08,328 --> 00:20:09,913
Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?

260
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,581
Is...? Heh-heh.

261
00:20:11,748 --> 00:20:13,291
The Palisades? Sure.

262
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,919
You know, as our new DA,
you might wanna figure out...

263
00:20:16,086 --> 00:20:17,921
...where your jurisdiction ends.

264
00:20:18,088 --> 00:20:22,050
I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante.

265
00:20:22,217 --> 00:20:25,595
Gotham City is proud of an ordinary
citizen standing up for what's right.

266
00:20:25,762 --> 00:20:28,014
Gotham needs heroes like you,
elected officials...

267
00:20:28,181 --> 00:20:30,142
...not a man who thinks
he's above the law.

268
00:20:30,308 --> 00:20:31,476
Who appointed the Batman?

269
00:20:31,643 --> 00:20:35,480
We did. All of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city.

270
00:20:35,647 --> 00:20:37,399
NATASCHA:
But this is a democracy, Harvey.

271
00:20:37,566 --> 00:20:39,317
DENT:
When their enemies were at the gates...

272
00:20:39,484 --> 00:20:43,196
...the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city.

273
00:20:43,363 --> 00:20:45,949
It wasn't considered an honor,
it was a public service.

274
00:20:46,116 --> 00:20:47,784
Harvey, the last man
that they appointed...

275
00:20:47,951 --> 00:20:50,245
...to protect the republic
was named Caesar...

276
00:20:50,412 --> 00:20:53,832
...and he never gave up his power.
- Okay, fine.

277
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:55,333
You either die a hero...

278
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,545
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

279
00:20:58,712 --> 00:21:02,215
Whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
wanna do this for the rest of his life.

280
00:21:02,382 --> 00:21:05,635
How could he? Batman is looking for
someone to take up his mantle.

281
00:21:05,802 --> 00:21:08,096
NATASCHA:
Someone like you, Mr. Dent?

282
00:21:08,555 --> 00:21:11,016
Maybe. If I'm up to it.

283
00:21:11,183 --> 00:21:16,438
What if Harvey Dent
is the Caped Crusader? Hm?

284
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,860
If I were sneaking out every night,
someone would've noticed by now.

285
00:21:24,237 --> 00:21:28,366
Well, I'm sold, Dent,
and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.

286
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:31,369
That's nice, but I'm not
up for reelection for three years.

287
00:21:31,536 --> 00:21:33,455
No, you don't understand.

288
00:21:33,622 --> 00:21:36,416
One fundraiser with my pals...

289
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:39,169
...you'll never need another cent.

290
00:21:53,892 --> 00:21:56,019
What the hell is this?

291
00:21:57,354 --> 00:22:00,482
As you're all aware,
one of our deposits was stolen.

292
00:22:00,649 --> 00:22:04,027
A relatively small amount, 68 million.

293
00:22:04,194 --> 00:22:06,738
Who's stupid enough to steal from us?

294
00:22:07,072 --> 00:22:10,617
Two-bit wackjob,
wears a cheap purple suit and makeup.

295
00:22:10,784 --> 00:22:12,744
He's not the problem. He's a nobody.

296
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:16,289
The problem is our money
being tracked by the cops.

297
00:22:16,456 --> 00:22:18,959
Thanks to Mr. Maroni's
well-placed sources...

298
00:22:19,126 --> 00:22:22,921
...we know that police have indeed
identified our banks using marked bills...

299
00:22:23,088 --> 00:22:25,590
...and are planning to
seize your funds today.

300
00:22:25,757 --> 00:22:29,761
And since the enthusiastic new D A has
put all my competitors out of business...

301
00:22:30,387 --> 00:22:33,890
...I'm your only option.
MARONl: So, what are you proposing?

302
00:22:34,057 --> 00:22:37,727
LAU: Moving all deposits to
one secure location, not a bank.

303
00:22:37,894 --> 00:22:39,855
- Where, then?
- No one can know but me.

304
00:22:40,605 --> 00:22:43,358
If the police were to gain leverage
over one of you...

305
00:22:43,525 --> 00:22:45,318
...everyone's money would be at stake.

306
00:22:45,485 --> 00:22:47,612
What stop them getting to you?

307
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:50,866
I go to Hong Kong,
far from Dent's jurisdiction...

308
00:22:51,241 --> 00:22:54,119
...and the Chinese will not extradite
one of their own.

309
00:22:54,286 --> 00:22:55,912
MARONl:
How soon can you move the money?

310
00:22:56,204 --> 00:22:57,289
LAU:
I already have.

311
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:02,294
For obvious reasons, I couldn't wait
for your permission.

312
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:06,590
Rest assured, your money is safe.

313
00:23:18,935 --> 00:23:21,188
And I thought my jokes were bad.

314
00:23:21,354 --> 00:23:24,441
Give me one reason why I shouldn't
have my boy pull your head off.

315
00:23:24,608 --> 00:23:25,901
How about a magic trick?

316
00:23:29,237 --> 00:23:31,573
I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.

317
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,661
It's...

318
00:23:36,828 --> 00:23:39,122
It's gone.

319
00:23:39,498 --> 00:23:41,833
Oh, and by the way,
the suit, it wasn't cheap.

320
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,836
- You ought to know, you bought it.
CHECHEN: Sit.

321
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:48,965
I want to hear proposition.

322
00:23:51,676 --> 00:23:54,179
JOKER:
Let's wind the clocks back a year.

323
00:23:54,513 --> 00:24:00,185
These cops and lawyers
wouldn't dare cross any of you.

324
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:03,480
I mean, what happened?

325
00:24:03,647 --> 00:24:07,442
Did your balls drop off? Hm?

326
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:09,653
You see, a guy like me...

327
00:24:10,112 --> 00:24:12,864
- A freak.
MOBSTER 1: Damn right.

328
00:24:13,031 --> 00:24:16,159
A guy like me... Look, listen.

329
00:24:16,701 --> 00:24:20,997
I know why you choose
to have your little, ahem...

330
00:24:21,164 --> 00:24:23,875
...group-therapy sessions
in broad daylight.

331
00:24:24,376 --> 00:24:27,170
I know why you're afraid
to go out at night.

332
00:24:29,381 --> 00:24:31,049
The Batman.

333
00:24:31,216 --> 00:24:36,471
See, Batman has shown Gotham
your true colors, unfortunately.

334
00:24:36,638 --> 00:24:40,142
Dent, he's just the beginning.

335
00:24:40,725 --> 00:24:45,480
And as for the television's
so-called plan...

336
00:24:45,939 --> 00:24:47,816
...Batman has no jurisdiction.

337
00:24:47,983 --> 00:24:50,569
He'll find him and make him squeal.

338
00:24:50,735 --> 00:24:53,738
I know the squealers when I see them...

339
00:24:53,905 --> 00:24:55,574
...and...

340
00:24:56,324 --> 00:24:57,826
CHECHEN:
What do you propose?

341
00:24:57,993 --> 00:25:00,412
It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman.

342
00:25:01,746 --> 00:25:04,708
If it's so simple, why haven't
you done it already?

343
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:07,586
If you're good at something,
never do it for free.

344
00:25:08,253 --> 00:25:09,546
How much you want?

345
00:25:10,255 --> 00:25:12,257
Uh, half.

346
00:25:14,468 --> 00:25:17,220
GAMBOL: You're crazy.
- No, I'm not.

347
00:25:17,387 --> 00:25:19,514
No, I'm not.

348
00:25:21,099 --> 00:25:24,519
If we don't deal with this now...

349
00:25:24,686 --> 00:25:26,313
...soon...

350
00:25:26,521 --> 00:25:31,443
...little Gambol here won't be able
to get a nickel for his grandma.

351
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,570
Enough from the clown!

352
00:25:33,737 --> 00:25:36,698
Ah, ta-ta-ta. Let's not blow...

353
00:25:36,865 --> 00:25:39,409
MOBSTER 2: Shit!
...this out of proportion.

354
00:25:39,576 --> 00:25:42,078
You think you can steal from us
and just walk away?

355
00:25:42,245 --> 00:25:43,789
- Yeah.
GAMBOL: I'm putting the word out.

356
00:25:43,955 --> 00:25:46,249
Five hundred grand for this clown dead.

357
00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:49,461
A million alive, so I can teach him
some manners first.

358
00:25:50,754 --> 00:25:53,340
All right. So, listen,
why don't you give me a call...

359
00:25:53,507 --> 00:25:57,260
...when you wanna start taking things
a little more seriously?

360
00:25:57,427 --> 00:25:59,304
Here's my card.

361
00:26:19,407 --> 00:26:21,785
You're a hard man to reach.

362
00:26:24,788 --> 00:26:27,082
Lau's halfway to Hong Kong.

363
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:31,211
If you'd have asked,
I could have taken his passport.

364
00:26:31,378 --> 00:26:34,047
All that was left in the vaults
were marked bills.

365
00:26:34,214 --> 00:26:37,509
They knew we were coming.
As soon as your office got involved...

366
00:26:37,676 --> 00:26:38,718
My office?

367
00:26:38,885 --> 00:26:42,556
You're sitting down there with scum like
Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking...

368
00:26:42,722 --> 00:26:45,851
Oh, yeah. I almost had your rookie
cold on a racketeering beat.

369
00:26:46,017 --> 00:26:50,564
Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly
Maroni's got people in your office, Dent.

370
00:26:53,358 --> 00:26:55,318
We need Lau back...

371
00:26:55,485 --> 00:26:59,448
...but the Chinese won't extradite
a national under any circumstances.

372
00:26:59,781 --> 00:27:02,492
If I get him to you,
can you get him to talk?

373
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:03,869
I'll get him to sing.

374
00:27:04,035 --> 00:27:06,788
We're going after the Mob's life savings.

375
00:27:06,955 --> 00:27:08,206
Things will get ugly.

376
00:27:08,373 --> 00:27:10,667
I knew the risk when I took this job,
lieutenant.

377
00:27:10,834 --> 00:27:12,377
How will you get him back, any...?

378
00:27:14,963 --> 00:27:16,381
He does that.

379
00:27:16,548 --> 00:27:20,051
Our Chinese friends left town
before I could tell them the deal was off.

380
00:27:20,218 --> 00:27:23,722
Well, I'm sure that you've always
wanted to go to Hong Kong.

381
00:27:23,889 --> 00:27:26,057
What's wrong with a phone call?

382
00:27:26,224 --> 00:27:29,853
I think Mr. Lau deserves
a more personal touch.

383
00:27:31,062 --> 00:27:32,898
FOX: Now, for high-altitude jumps...

384
00:27:33,064 --> 00:27:35,859
...you're going to need oxygen
and stabilizers.

385
00:27:36,026 --> 00:27:39,654
Well, I must say,
compared to your usual requests...

386
00:27:39,821 --> 00:27:42,407
...jumping out of an airplane
is pretty straightforward.

387
00:27:43,033 --> 00:27:45,160
BRUCE:
What about getting back into the plane?

388
00:27:45,327 --> 00:27:49,164
- I'd recommend a good travel agent.
- Without it landing.

389
00:27:50,332 --> 00:27:53,084
Now, that's more like it, Mr. Wayne.

390
00:27:53,627 --> 00:27:56,254
The CIA had a program
back in the '60s...

391
00:27:56,421 --> 00:27:59,758
...for getting their people out
of hot spots called Sky Hook.

392
00:27:59,925 --> 00:28:02,594
- We could look into that.
- Yeah.

393
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:04,429
Okay. Now...

394
00:28:05,931 --> 00:28:08,642
Hardened Kevlar plates
over titanium-dipped...

395
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:10,936
...tri-weave fibers for flexibility.

396
00:28:11,102 --> 00:28:13,939
You'll be lighter, faster, more agile.

397
00:28:17,442 --> 00:28:19,611
Perhaps you should
read the instructions first?

398
00:28:19,778 --> 00:28:21,780
- Yeah.
- Now, there is a tradeoff.

399
00:28:21,947 --> 00:28:25,450
Separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.

400
00:28:25,617 --> 00:28:28,578
We wouldn't wanna make things
too easy, now, would we?

401
00:28:28,745 --> 00:28:30,789
How will it hold up against dogs?

402
00:28:30,956 --> 00:28:33,083
We talking rottweilers or Chihuahuas?

403
00:28:34,292 --> 00:28:36,795
Should do fine against cats.

404
00:28:36,962 --> 00:28:39,089
I found one in Arizona.

405
00:28:39,256 --> 00:28:42,175
A very nice man said he could have it
up and running in a week...

406
00:28:42,342 --> 00:28:43,426
...and he takes cash.

407
00:28:43,593 --> 00:28:46,429
- What about the flight crew?
- South Korean smugglers.

408
00:28:46,596 --> 00:28:48,807
They run flights into Pyongyang,
below radar.

409
00:28:48,974 --> 00:28:51,726
- Did you think of an alibi?
- Oh, yes.

410
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,439
PERFORMANCE CANCELLED

411
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:04,781
Love Boat: Billionaire Absconds
With Entire Russian Ballet

412
00:29:10,495 --> 00:29:13,123
I believe this is your plane, sir.

413
00:29:17,335 --> 00:29:20,839
You look tired, Alfred.
You'll be all right without me?

414
00:29:22,507 --> 00:29:26,011
If you can tell me the Russian for
"apply your own bloody suntan lotion."

415
00:29:37,147 --> 00:29:40,984
Yo, Gambol, somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the Joker.

416
00:29:41,151 --> 00:29:42,986
BOD YGUARD:
They brought the body.

417
00:29:59,377 --> 00:30:01,880
So, dead, that's 500.

418
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,634
How about alive? Hm?

419
00:30:08,845 --> 00:30:12,015
You wanna know how I got these scars?

420
00:30:13,934 --> 00:30:16,937
My father was...

421
00:30:17,103 --> 00:30:18,563
...a drinker...

422
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,981
...and a fiend.

423
00:30:20,816 --> 00:30:24,986
And one night,
he goes off crazier than usual.

424
00:30:25,403 --> 00:30:28,198
Mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself.

425
00:30:28,365 --> 00:30:29,908
He doesn't like that...

426
00:30:30,075 --> 00:30:33,537
...not one bit.

427
00:30:33,703 --> 00:30:36,248
So, me watching...

428
00:30:36,414 --> 00:30:41,002
...he takes the knife to her,
laughing while he does it.

429
00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:44,256
He turns to me and he says:

430
00:30:44,422 --> 00:30:48,093
"Why so serious?"

431
00:30:48,343 --> 00:30:49,928
He comes at me with the knife.

432
00:30:50,595 --> 00:30:52,514
"Why so serious?"

433
00:30:54,766 --> 00:30:57,644
He sticks the blade in my mouth.

434
00:30:57,978 --> 00:31:01,898
"Let's put a smile on that face."

435
00:31:03,108 --> 00:31:05,318
And...

436
00:31:07,696 --> 00:31:09,239
Why so serious?

437
00:31:14,286 --> 00:31:15,787
Now...

438
00:31:15,954 --> 00:31:18,206
...our operation is small...

439
00:31:18,373 --> 00:31:21,293
...but there is a lot of potential...

440
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,004
...for aggressive expansion.

441
00:31:24,171 --> 00:31:27,382
So which of you fine gentlemen
would like to join our team?

442
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:31,970
Oh. There's only one spot open
right now, so we're gonna have...

443
00:31:32,637 --> 00:31:34,806
...tryouts.

444
00:31:39,394 --> 00:31:41,396
Make it fast.

445
00:31:50,822 --> 00:31:52,240
MAN:
Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox.

446
00:31:52,407 --> 00:31:55,118
Mr. Lau regrets he is unable
to greet you in person today.

447
00:31:55,285 --> 00:31:57,204
FOX:
I understand.

448
00:32:07,005 --> 00:32:10,592
For security purposes, I'm gonna have to
ask you to check in your mobile.

449
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:12,344
Of course.

450
00:32:15,096 --> 00:32:18,809
I must apologize for leaving Gotham
in the middle of our negotiations.

451
00:32:18,975 --> 00:32:22,521
This misunderstanding
with the Gotham police force...

452
00:32:22,687 --> 00:32:25,232
...I couldn't let it threaten my company.
- Of course.

453
00:32:25,398 --> 00:32:28,568
A businessman of your stature
will understand and...

454
00:32:28,735 --> 00:32:32,697
...with you here now, we can continue.

455
00:32:32,864 --> 00:32:36,618
Well, I do appreciate you bringing me
out here in such style, Mr. Lau, but I re...

456
00:32:38,161 --> 00:32:39,996
We do not allow cell phones in here.

457
00:32:40,163 --> 00:32:42,874
I'm sorry. Forgot I had it.

458
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:47,671
No, I really came to tell you that
our business deal has to be put on hold.

459
00:32:48,213 --> 00:32:51,299
You see, we can't afford
to be seen to do business with...

460
00:32:52,425 --> 00:32:54,386
...whatever it is you're accused of being.

461
00:32:54,553 --> 00:32:57,139
I'm sure a businessman of your stature
will understand.

462
00:32:57,305 --> 00:33:01,226
I think, Mr. Fox, a simple phone call
might have sufficed.

463
00:33:01,393 --> 00:33:04,771
Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think
he was deliberately wasting your time.

464
00:33:04,938 --> 00:33:06,565
Just accidentally wasting it.

465
00:33:07,566 --> 00:33:11,736
That's very good, Mr. Lau.
"Accidentally." Very good.

466
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:13,864
Hey, sir.

467
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:34,092
There's a better view
from the peak tram.

468
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:36,094
How's the view from LSI Holdings?

469
00:33:36,386 --> 00:33:37,929
Restricted.

470
00:33:38,096 --> 00:33:40,098
Lau is holed up in there good and tight.

471
00:33:40,265 --> 00:33:42,184
- What's this?
- I had R & D work it up.

472
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,019
Sends out a high-frequency pulse...

473
00:33:44,186 --> 00:33:47,022
...records the response time
for mapping an environment.

474
00:33:47,522 --> 00:33:50,108
Sonar. Just like a...

475
00:33:50,275 --> 00:33:52,444
Submarine, Mr. Wayne.
Like a submarine.

476
00:33:52,944 --> 00:33:54,780
- And the other device?
- It's in place.

477
00:33:55,697 --> 00:33:56,740
Mr. Wayne?

478
00:33:57,949 --> 00:33:59,242
Good luck.

479
00:37:42,507 --> 00:37:45,343
Please Deliver To
LIEUTENANT GORDON

480
00:37:49,222 --> 00:37:52,392
RACHEL: Look, give us the money
and we'll talk about making a deal.

481
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:55,854
The money is the only reason
I'm still alive.

482
00:37:56,021 --> 00:38:00,150
Oh, you mean, when they find out that
you've helped us, they're gonna kill you?

483
00:38:00,317 --> 00:38:02,027
- Are you threatening my client?
- No.

484
00:38:02,194 --> 00:38:06,406
I'm just assuming your client's
cooperation with this investigation.

485
00:38:08,033 --> 00:38:09,701
As will everyone.

486
00:38:11,036 --> 00:38:14,372
No? Okay.

487
00:38:14,831 --> 00:38:17,834
Enjoy your time in County, Mr. Lau.

488
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:19,503
LAU:
Wait!

489
00:38:19,711 --> 00:38:21,713
I won't give you the money...

490
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,883
...but I will give you my clients,
all of them.

491
00:38:25,175 --> 00:38:27,385
You were a glorified accountant.

492
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:31,389
What could you possibly have
on all of them that we could charge?

493
00:38:31,556 --> 00:38:35,393
I'm good with calculation.
I handled all their investments.

494
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,145
One big pot.

495
00:38:38,522 --> 00:38:39,856
Got it.

496
00:38:40,273 --> 00:38:42,109
One minute.

497
00:38:42,901 --> 00:38:45,612
RICO. If they pooled their money...

498
00:38:45,779 --> 00:38:47,572
...we can charge them
as one criminal conspiracy.

499
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:48,907
Charge them with what?

500
00:38:49,074 --> 00:38:51,952
In a RICO case, if you can charge
one of conspiracy with a felony...

501
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:54,704
You can charge all of  with it.
That's great.

502
00:38:56,081 --> 00:38:57,999
Mr. Lau.

503
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,004
What kind of details do you have
about this communal fund?

504
00:39:03,171 --> 00:39:04,798
- Ledgers...?
- Immunity, protection...

505
00:39:04,965 --> 00:39:08,426
...a chartered plane back to Hong Kong.
- After you testify in open court.

506
00:39:08,593 --> 00:39:10,929
I'm just curious.
With all your clients locked up...

507
00:39:11,263 --> 00:39:13,473
...what's gonna happen
with all that money?

508
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,768
Like I said, I'm good with calculation.

509
00:39:16,935 --> 00:39:21,606
He can't go to County.
I'll keep him here in the holding cells.

510
00:39:21,773 --> 00:39:24,317
What is this, Gordon, your fortress?

511
00:39:24,613 --> 00:39:27,283
Well, you trust them over at County?

512
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,285
I don't trust them here.

513
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:32,538
Lau stays.

514
00:39:32,997 --> 00:39:35,583
Well, I don 't know about
Mr. Lau's travel arrangements...

515
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:37,543
...but I'm sure glad he's back.

516
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,171
Put word out. We hire the clown.

517
00:39:42,965 --> 00:39:46,802
He was right.
We have to fix real problem.

518
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:48,429
Batman.

519
00:39:52,975 --> 00:39:56,896
- I'm not aware of any participation...
- Our boy looks good on the tube.

520
00:39:57,396 --> 00:40:00,149
You sure you wanna embarrass me
in front of my friends?

521
00:40:00,316 --> 00:40:03,986
Oh, don't worry. They're coming too.

522
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:12,661
STEPHENS:
Have a nice trip. See you next fall.

523
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:14,663
WOMAN: Seven hundred
twelve counts of extortion.

524
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:17,249
Eight hundred and forty-nine
counts of racketeering.

525
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:19,960
Two hundred and forty-six
counts of fraud.

526
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:22,963
Eighty-seven counts
of conspiracy murder.

527
00:40:23,881 --> 00:40:27,009
Five hundred and twenty-seven
counts of obstruction of justice.

528
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:28,803
How do the defendants plead?

529
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:37,019
Order in the court.

530
00:40:37,186 --> 00:40:39,688
MAYOR: Five hundred and forty-nine
criminals at once.

531
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:42,358
How did you convince Surrillo
to hear this farce?

532
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:46,654
She shares my enthusiasm for justice.
After all, she is a judge.

533
00:40:46,821 --> 00:40:49,865
Even if you blow enough smoke
to get convictions out of Surrillo...

534
00:40:50,032 --> 00:40:52,618
...you're gonna set
a new record at appeals.

535
00:40:52,785 --> 00:40:55,287
It won't matter.
The head guys make bail, sure.

536
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:57,873
But the midlevel guys, they can't.

537
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,875
They can't afford to be off the streets.

538
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:02,169
They'll cut deals that
include some jail time.

539
00:41:02,336 --> 00:41:05,339
Think of all you could do
with 18 months of clean streets.

540
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:10,010
LOEB: Mr. Mayor, you can't...
- No, get out. Both of you.

541
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:15,724
Sit down.

542
00:41:20,688 --> 00:41:23,691
The public likes you. That's the
only reason that this might fly.

543
00:41:23,858 --> 00:41:25,192
But that means it's on you.

544
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,404
They're all gonna come after you now,
and not just the Mob.

545
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:32,408
Politicians, journalists, cops.

546
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:35,077
Anyone whose wallet's
about to get lighter.

547
00:41:35,244 --> 00:41:37,913
Are you up to it? You'd better be.

548
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,207
Because they get anything on you...

549
00:41:40,374 --> 00:41:45,171
...and those criminals are back on the
streets, followed swiftly by you and me.

550
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:46,630
Jesus!

551
00:42:07,777 --> 00:42:10,237
ALFRED: I think your fundraiser
will be a great success, sir.

552
00:42:10,404 --> 00:42:13,073
BRUCE: And why do you think I wanna
hold a party for Harvey Dent?

553
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,327
I assumed it was your usual reason
for socializing beyond myself...

554
00:42:16,494 --> 00:42:18,537
...and the scum of Gotham's underbelly:

555
00:42:18,704 --> 00:42:20,498
To try to impress Miss Dawes.

556
00:42:20,664 --> 00:42:24,752
Very droll, but very wrong.
Actually, it's Dent.

557
00:42:24,919 --> 00:42:27,797
ENGEL [ON TV]: Police released video
footage found concealed on the body.

558
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:30,591
Sensitive viewers, be aware.
The image is disturbing.

559
00:42:30,758 --> 00:42:32,968
JOKER:
Tell them your name.

560
00:42:33,135 --> 00:42:34,804
Brian Douglas.

561
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:38,724
JOKER:
And are you the real Batman?

562
00:42:38,891 --> 00:42:39,934
BRIAN: No.
JOKER: No?

563
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,061
- No.
- No?

564
00:42:42,228 --> 00:42:43,938
Then why do you dress up like him?

565
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:50,778
BRIAN: Because he's a symbol that we
don 't have to be afraid of scum like you.

566
00:42:50,945 --> 00:42:54,281
Yeah. You do, Brian. You really do.

567
00:42:58,244 --> 00:43:02,706
So you think Batman 's
made Gotham a better place? Hm?

568
00:43:02,915 --> 00:43:04,458
Look at me.

569
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:06,919
Look at me!

570
00:43:10,673 --> 00:43:14,176
You see, this is how crazy
Batman 's made Gotham.

571
00:43:14,343 --> 00:43:16,637
You want order in Gotham...

572
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:21,392
...Batman must take off his mask
and turn himself in.

573
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:25,354
Oh, and every day he doesn 't,
people will die.

574
00:43:25,688 --> 00:43:27,815
Starting tonight.

575
00:43:28,232 --> 00:43:30,443
I'm a man of my word.

576
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:50,546
Harvey Dent,
scourge of the underworld...

577
00:43:50,713 --> 00:43:53,799
...scared stiff by the trust-fund brigade.

578
00:43:53,966 --> 00:43:55,217
- I'll be back.
- Rachel.

579
00:43:55,384 --> 00:43:58,220
A little liquid courage, Mr. Dent?

580
00:43:58,387 --> 00:44:00,806
- Thank you. Alfred, right?
- That's right, sir.

581
00:44:00,973 --> 00:44:04,268
Rachel talks about you all the time.
You've known her her whole life.

582
00:44:04,435 --> 00:44:05,686
Not yet, sir.

583
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,232
Any psychotic ex-boyfriends
I should be aware of?

584
00:44:10,399 --> 00:44:12,651
Oh, you have no idea.

585
00:44:31,587 --> 00:44:33,005
BRUCE: I'm sorry that I'm late.

586
00:44:33,172 --> 00:44:35,549
I'm glad to see
that you all got started without me.

587
00:44:35,716 --> 00:44:39,428
Now, where is Harvey? Where...?

588
00:44:39,595 --> 00:44:42,014
Harvey Dent, the man of the hour.

589
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:43,516
Where's Rachel Dawes?

590
00:44:43,682 --> 00:44:46,060
She is my oldest friend. Come here.

591
00:44:46,227 --> 00:44:48,729
When Rachel first told me she
was dating Harvey Dent...

592
00:44:48,896 --> 00:44:50,105
...I had one thing to say:

593
00:44:50,314 --> 00:44:52,733
"The guy from those God-awful
campaign commercials?"

594
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,737
"I believe in Harvey Dent."
Yeah, nice slogan, Harvey.

595
00:44:56,904 --> 00:44:58,906
But it caught Rachel's attention.

596
00:44:59,073 --> 00:45:02,076
And then I started to pay attention
to Harvey...

597
00:45:02,493 --> 00:45:05,788
...and all that he's been doing
as our new DA.

598
00:45:05,955 --> 00:45:07,748
And you know what?

599
00:45:09,792 --> 00:45:11,293
I believe in Harvey Dent.

600
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:15,047
I believe that on his watch,
Gotham can feel...

601
00:45:15,214 --> 00:45:18,884
...a little safer, a little more optimistic.

602
00:45:20,302 --> 00:45:24,640
Look at this face. This is the face
of Gotham's bright future.

603
00:45:24,807 --> 00:45:26,976
To Harvey Dent. Let's hear it for him.

604
00:45:27,351 --> 00:45:28,894
MAN:
Harvey.

605
00:45:38,404 --> 00:45:39,864
Harvey may not know you
well enough...

606
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:41,991
...to understand you're
making fun of him...

607
00:45:42,158 --> 00:45:44,160
...but I do.
- No, I meant every word.

608
00:45:45,494 --> 00:45:48,414
You know that day
that you once told me about...

609
00:45:48,581 --> 00:45:50,666
...when Gotham would no longer
need Batman?

610
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:52,751
- It's coming.
- Bruce.

611
00:45:53,586 --> 00:45:59,175
- You can't ask me to wait for that.
- It's happening now. Harvey is that hero.

612
00:45:59,341 --> 00:46:03,804
He locked up half of the city's criminals,
and he did it without wearing a mask.

613
00:46:03,971 --> 00:46:06,182
Gotham needs a hero with a face.

614
00:46:07,016 --> 00:46:09,310
DENT: You can throw a party, Wayne,
I'll give you that.

615
00:46:10,686 --> 00:46:12,605
Thanks again.

616
00:46:13,397 --> 00:46:15,107
You mind if I borrow Rachel?

617
00:46:18,569 --> 00:46:20,946
Lieutenant, that joker card
pinned to the body?

618
00:46:21,113 --> 00:46:22,865
Forensics found three sets of DNA.

619
00:46:23,032 --> 00:46:24,450
- Any matches?
- All three.

620
00:46:24,617 --> 00:46:28,120
The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.

621
00:46:28,287 --> 00:46:30,289
The Joker's telling us
who he's targeting.

622
00:46:30,456 --> 00:46:33,334
Get a unit over to Surrillo's house.
Tell Wuertz to find Dent.

623
00:46:33,501 --> 00:46:35,544
Get them both to Protective custody.
Where's the commissioner?

624
00:46:35,711 --> 00:46:37,213
- City hall.
- Seal the building.

625
00:46:37,379 --> 00:46:39,381
- No one in or out till I get there.
- Got it.

626
00:46:51,685 --> 00:46:54,063
Gordon. What are you up to?

627
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:57,483
We're secure. I want a floor-by-floor
search of the entire building.

628
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:00,236
We believe the Joker's
made a threat against your life.

629
00:47:00,402 --> 00:47:01,821
These are dangerous people.

630
00:47:01,987 --> 00:47:03,739
You're not giving me
a lot of information.

631
00:47:03,906 --> 00:47:05,866
Even we don't know
where you're going.

632
00:47:06,033 --> 00:47:09,370
Take the envelope, get in, open it.
It'll tell you where you're headed.

633
00:47:13,207 --> 00:47:15,126
You can't leave me alone
with these people.

634
00:47:15,292 --> 00:47:18,337
The whole Mob's after you
and you're worried about these guys?

635
00:47:18,504 --> 00:47:20,464
Compared to this,
the Mob doesn't scare me.

636
00:47:20,631 --> 00:47:24,218
Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this
for yourself, so...

637
00:47:24,385 --> 00:47:28,472
...take my word, the police commissioner
earns a lot of threats.

638
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:34,186
I found the appropriate response
to these situations a long time ago.

639
00:47:34,395 --> 00:47:36,647
Them gunning for you
makes you see things clearly.

640
00:47:36,814 --> 00:47:38,149
Yeah, I bet.

641
00:47:38,315 --> 00:47:42,611
Yeah. It makes you think about things
you couldn't stand losing...

642
00:47:42,778 --> 00:47:44,780
...about who you wanna
spend your life with.

643
00:47:44,947 --> 00:47:47,950
- That's a pretty big commitment.
- Not if the Mob has their way.

644
00:47:53,164 --> 00:47:55,875
You get to explain to my wife...

645
00:47:56,792 --> 00:47:58,377
...why I'm late for dinner.

646
00:47:58,544 --> 00:48:01,714
Sir, the joker card
had traces of your DNA on it.

647
00:48:03,299 --> 00:48:05,926
- Don't do that.
- All right.

648
00:48:06,469 --> 00:48:09,388
- Let's be serious, then.
- Okay.

649
00:48:09,722 --> 00:48:10,764
What's your answer?

650
00:48:16,937 --> 00:48:18,439
I don't have an answer.

651
00:48:20,608 --> 00:48:21,650
How'd they get my DNA?

652
00:48:21,817 --> 00:48:23,986
Somebody with access
to your office or house...

653
00:48:24,153 --> 00:48:26,781
...must have lifted a tissue
or a glass... Wait! Wait!

654
00:48:26,947 --> 00:48:29,867
- Well, I guess no answer is a no.
- Harvey.

655
00:48:30,034 --> 00:48:32,161
- It's someone else, isn't it?
- Harvey.

656
00:48:32,328 --> 00:48:35,498
Just tell me it's not Wayne.
The guy's a complete f...

657
00:48:35,998 --> 00:48:37,458
What are you doing?

658
00:48:48,636 --> 00:48:49,678
GORDON:
Oh, shit.

659
00:48:55,851 --> 00:48:57,603
GORDON:
Get a medic!

660
00:49:01,023 --> 00:49:02,149
They've come for him.

661
00:49:03,651 --> 00:49:04,819
We made it.

662
00:49:07,404 --> 00:49:08,447
Stay hidden.

663
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:14,036
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

664
00:49:16,956 --> 00:49:20,876
We are tonight's entertainment.

665
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:24,046
I only have one question:

666
00:49:24,255 --> 00:49:27,800
Where is Harvey Dent?

667
00:49:37,268 --> 00:49:39,353
You know where Harvey is?
You know who he is?

668
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,813
THUG:
Hands up, pretty boy.

669
00:49:47,945 --> 00:49:50,739
Do you know where I can find Harvey?
I need to talk to him.

670
00:49:50,906 --> 00:49:53,742
Just something little, huh? No.

671
00:49:56,036 --> 00:49:58,789
What's going on out there? Wayne!

672
00:50:00,249 --> 00:50:01,625
Oh, thank God, you've
got a panic room.

673
00:50:01,792 --> 00:50:02,960
MAN: Hey, wait...

674
00:50:03,544 --> 00:50:05,337
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

675
00:50:05,629 --> 00:50:07,631
You know, I'll settle for his loved ones.

676
00:50:07,798 --> 00:50:11,302
We're not intimidated by thugs.

677
00:50:12,261 --> 00:50:13,971
You know...

678
00:50:15,598 --> 00:50:18,601
...you remind me of my father.

679
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:20,895
I hated my father.

680
00:50:21,061 --> 00:50:23,105
RACHEL:
Okay, stop.

681
00:50:26,942 --> 00:50:29,779
Well, hello, beautiful.

682
00:50:31,947 --> 00:50:35,785
You must be Harvey's squeeze. Hm?

683
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,662
And you are beautiful.

684
00:50:45,586 --> 00:50:49,465
You look nervous. Is it the scars?

685
00:50:50,382 --> 00:50:52,593
You wanna know how I got them?

686
00:50:53,803 --> 00:50:56,347
Come here. Hey.

687
00:50:56,722 --> 00:50:58,432
Look at me.

688
00:50:58,891 --> 00:51:03,646
So I had a wife.
She was beautiful, like you...

689
00:51:03,896 --> 00:51:08,109
...who tells me I worry too much...

690
00:51:08,275 --> 00:51:11,195
...who tells me I ought to smile more...

691
00:51:11,362 --> 00:51:16,867
...who gambles and gets in deep
with the sharks. Hey.

692
00:51:17,284 --> 00:51:19,703
One day they carve her face.

693
00:51:20,204 --> 00:51:24,458
And we have no money for surgeries.
She can't take it.

694
00:51:24,834 --> 00:51:28,337
I just wanna see her smile again. Hm?

695
00:51:28,671 --> 00:51:31,590
I just want her to know
that I don't care about the scars.

696
00:51:32,133 --> 00:51:33,676
So...

697
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,930
...I stick a razor in my mouth
and do this...

698
00:51:38,389 --> 00:51:39,765
...to myself.

699
00:51:40,057 --> 00:51:45,146
And you know what?
She can't stand the sight of me.

700
00:51:45,312 --> 00:51:46,856
She leaves.

701
00:51:47,565 --> 00:51:49,984
Now I see the funny side.

702
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:52,445
Now I'm always smiling.

703
00:51:55,865 --> 00:51:59,201
You got a little fight in you. I like that.

704
00:51:59,368 --> 00:52:00,703
BATMAN:
Then you're gonna love me.

705
00:52:28,856 --> 00:52:30,065
Drop the gun.

706
00:52:30,232 --> 00:52:32,860
Oh, sure. You just take off
your little mask...

707
00:52:33,027 --> 00:52:35,237
...and show us all who
you really are. Hm?

708
00:52:40,868 --> 00:52:42,077
Let her go.

709
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:44,288
Very poor choice of words.

710
00:53:07,103 --> 00:53:08,979
Are you all right?

711
00:53:11,232 --> 00:53:13,609
Let's not do that again.

712
00:53:13,901 --> 00:53:16,403
- Is Harvey okay?
- He's safe.

713
00:53:17,947 --> 00:53:19,281
Thank you.

714
00:53:19,615 --> 00:53:20,658
Jim, it's over.

715
00:53:20,825 --> 00:53:23,410
As long as they don't get to Lau,
we've cut off their funds.

716
00:53:23,577 --> 00:53:25,079
The prosecution's over.

717
00:53:25,246 --> 00:53:26,914
Nobody's standing up
in front of a judge...

718
00:53:27,081 --> 00:53:30,084
...while judges and police commissioners
are getting blown away.

719
00:53:30,251 --> 00:53:32,044
- What about Dent?
- He's got any sense...

720
00:53:32,211 --> 00:53:33,295
...Dent's halfway to Mex...

721
00:53:33,462 --> 00:53:35,047
DENT:
So where do you keep your trash?

722
00:53:36,382 --> 00:53:40,344
You're due in court. I need you alive
long enough to get you on the record.

723
00:53:40,511 --> 00:53:43,556
You can't protect me.
You can't even protect yourselves.

724
00:53:43,722 --> 00:53:47,059
You refuse to cooperate, you're not
coming back here, you go to County.

725
00:53:47,226 --> 00:53:49,687
How long do you calculate
you'll last in there?

726
00:53:51,105 --> 00:53:52,606
Targeting me won't get their money.

727
00:53:52,773 --> 00:53:54,608
I knew the Mob wouldn't go
down easily...

728
00:53:54,775 --> 00:53:56,861
...but this is different.
They crossed a line.

729
00:53:57,027 --> 00:53:58,279
You crossed the line first.

730
00:53:58,446 --> 00:54:01,866
You squeezed them, you hammered them
to the point of desperation.

731
00:54:02,032 --> 00:54:07,037
And in their desperation, they turned to
a man they didn't fully understand.

732
00:54:07,538 --> 00:54:10,082
Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.

733
00:54:10,249 --> 00:54:12,460
We just need to figure out
what he's after.

734
00:54:12,626 --> 00:54:14,044
ALFRED:
With respect, Master Wayne...

735
00:54:14,211 --> 00:54:17,173
...perhaps this is a man
you don't fully understand either.

736
00:54:17,965 --> 00:54:20,676
A long time ago, I was in Burma...

737
00:54:20,843 --> 00:54:24,263
...and my friends and I were working
for the local government.

738
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:27,016
They were trying to buy
the loyalty of tribal leaders...

739
00:54:27,183 --> 00:54:30,019
...by bribing them with
precious stones...

740
00:54:30,186 --> 00:54:34,774
...but their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.

741
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:38,235
So we went looking for the stones.

742
00:54:38,611 --> 00:54:43,741
But in six months, we never
met anyone who traded with him.

743
00:54:44,366 --> 00:54:48,370
One day, I saw a child
playing with a ruby...

744
00:54:48,537 --> 00:54:51,582
...the size of a tangerine.

745
00:54:51,832 --> 00:54:55,211
The bandit had been
throwing them away.

746
00:54:55,878 --> 00:54:58,589
- So why steal them?
- Because he thought it was good sport.

747
00:54:58,756 --> 00:55:03,719
Because some men aren't looking
for anything logical, like money.

748
00:55:03,886 --> 00:55:08,140
They can't be bought, bullied,
reasoned or negotiated with.

749
00:55:08,557 --> 00:55:12,394
Some men just wanna
watch the world burn.

750
00:55:32,832 --> 00:55:33,999
WOMAN:
Your name, sir?

751
00:55:34,166 --> 00:55:37,336
JOKER: Eighth and Orchard.
You'll find Harvey Dent there.

752
00:55:50,224 --> 00:55:51,684
BATMAN:
Check the names.

753
00:55:58,274 --> 00:55:59,984
"Richard Dent."

754
00:56:02,194 --> 00:56:03,279
"Patrick Harvey."

755
00:56:03,571 --> 00:56:04,613
Harvey Dent.

756
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:07,783
I need 10 minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it.

757
00:56:07,992 --> 00:56:10,202
It's because of you
these guys are dead...

758
00:56:10,369 --> 00:56:11,912
Detective!

759
00:56:14,123 --> 00:56:16,167
Give us a minute, guys.

760
00:56:17,376 --> 00:56:18,961
That's brick underneath.

761
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:20,960
Gonna take ballistics
off a shattered bullet?

762
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:22,753
No.

763
00:56:24,213 --> 00:56:26,132
Fingerprints.

764
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:36,601
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

765
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:43,941
Because we found his next target.
He's put it in tomorrow's paper.

766
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:02,710
I'm not sure
you made it loud enough, sir.

767
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:17,934
What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?

768
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:21,896
You wanted me to do the diligence
on the LSI Holdings deal again.

769
00:57:22,563 --> 00:57:24,857
Well, I found some irregularities.

770
00:57:25,274 --> 00:57:27,360
Their CEO is in police custody.

771
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:30,446
No, not with their numbers, with yours.

772
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:33,741
Applied Sciences. Whole division
of Wayne Enterprises...

773
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,576
...just disappeared overnight.

774
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:39,997
I went down to the archives
and I started pulling some old files.

775
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,000
Don't tell me you didn't
recognize your baby...

776
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:46,796
...pancaking cop cars
on the evening news.

777
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:50,299
Now you got the entire R & D
Department burning through cash...

778
00:57:50,466 --> 00:57:53,803
...claiming it's related to
cell phones for the Army?

779
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:57,056
What are you building for him now,
a rocket ship?

780
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,685
I want...

781
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:04,772
...$ 10 million a year
for the rest of my life.

782
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:09,402
Let me get this straight.

783
00:58:10,611 --> 00:58:13,072
You think that your client...

784
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:16,325
One of the wealthiest,
most powerful men in the world...

785
00:58:16,492 --> 00:58:18,077
...is secretly a vigilante...

786
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:22,915
...who spends his nights beating
criminals to a pulp with his bare hands...

787
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:26,252
...and your plan
is to blackmail this person?

788
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,011
Good luck.

789
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,307
When...

790
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:42,185
Keep that.

791
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:51,319
FOX:
This is your original scan.

792
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:55,031
Here it is reengineered.

793
00:59:03,247 --> 00:59:06,793
And there's the thumbprint he left
when he pushed the round in the clip.

794
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:09,962
I'll get you a copy.

795
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:13,966
Mr. Wayne, did you reassign R & D?

796
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:16,636
Yeah. Government
telecommunications project.

797
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,846
Wasn't aware
we had any government contracts.

798
00:59:19,096 --> 00:59:22,100
You know, Lucius, I'm playing this one
pretty close to the chest.

799
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,936
Fair enough.

800
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:29,315
ENGEL: With no word
from the Batman...

801
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:30,983
...even as they mourn
Commissioner Loeb...

802
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:34,529
...these cops have to wonder if
the Joker will make good on his threat...

803
00:59:34,695 --> 00:59:37,907
...in the obituary column of
The Gotham Times to kill the mayor.

804
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:43,371
I've checked all the databases.
There are four possibles.

805
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:45,665
Cross-reference the addresses.

806
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:49,836
Look for Parkside,
overlooking the parade.

807
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:52,171
I got one.

808
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:56,342
Melvin White,
1502 Randolph Apartments.

809
00:59:56,717 --> 01:00:00,805
Aggravated assault,
moved to Arkham twice.

810
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,471
What do you got on the roof?

811
01:00:41,637 --> 01:00:45,183
We're tight, but frankly,
there's a lot of windows up here.

812
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:57,779
Commissioner Loeb dedicated his life
to law enforcement...

813
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:00,239
...and to the protection
of his community.

814
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:02,200
I remember when I first took office...

815
01:01:02,366 --> 01:01:04,911
...and I asked if he wanted
to stay on as commissioner.

816
01:01:05,077 --> 01:01:10,333
And he said he would, provided
I kept my politics out of his office.

817
01:01:14,086 --> 01:01:17,256
Clearly he was not a man who minced
words, nor should he have been.

818
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:21,928
A number of policies that he enacted
as commissioner were unpopular.

819
01:01:22,094 --> 01:01:25,348
Policies that flooded my office
with angry calls and letters...

820
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,395
- Who's that?
- What happened?

821
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:34,315
They took our guns.

822
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,275
And our uniforms.

823
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:45,618
MAYOR: And as we recognize
the sacrifice of this man...

824
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:49,747
...we must remember that vigilance
is the price of safety.

825
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:52,416
Stand by. Honor guard.

826
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:56,212
Attention. Port arms.

827
01:01:57,421 --> 01:02:01,801
Ready! Aim! Fire!

828
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:04,137
Ready! Aim!

829
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:10,143
Ready! Aim!

830
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:19,986
OFFICER:
Stay down! Don't move!

831
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,489
STEPHENS:
Mr. Mayor. Get him out of here.

832
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,959
- I'll see you later.
- Why are you going back?

833
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:48,639
Get out of here.

834
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:54,437
Tell me what you know about the Joker.

835
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:26,803
No.

836
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,554
I'm sorry, Barbara.

837
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:32,725
Jimmy, go play with your sister.
Go ahead, honey.

838
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:35,144
STEPHENS: If there's anything
we can do, anything you need...

839
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,063
...we're here for you.

840
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:41,984
BARBARA:
Are you out there?

841
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:47,824
Are you? You brought this
craziness on us. You did!

842
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,368
You brought this on us!

843
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:55,998
Switch it off, he ain't coming.
He doesn't wanna talk to us.

844
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:59,418
God help whoever
he does wanna talk to.

845
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:04,006
Can't we go someplace quieter?
We can't hear each other talk.

846
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:07,009
What makes you think
I wanna hear you talk?

847
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,219
What?

848
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:39,250
- Yeah?
MAN: Second.

849
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:40,460
Okay.

850
01:04:40,626 --> 01:04:42,795
- Harvey, where are you?
DENT: Where are you?

851
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:45,089
I'm where you should be,
at Major Crimes.

852
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:46,799
I'm trying to deal with all of this mess.

853
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:50,553
- Can I get the fingerprint analysis?
- Rachel, listen. You're not safe there.

854
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,513
- This is Gordon's unit.
- Gordon 's gone.

855
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:56,267
RACHEL: He vouched for these men.
- And he's gone.

856
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,982
The Joker's named you next.

857
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:06,152
God, is there someone, is there anyone
in this town we can trust?

858
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,029
Bruce.

859
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:09,489
We can trust Bruce Wayne.

860
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:11,240
No. Rachel, I know
you're his friend, but...

861
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:13,242
Harvey, trust me.

862
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:16,162
Bruce's penthouse is now
the safest place in the city.

863
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:17,663
Then you go straight there.

864
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,957
Don 't tell anybody
and I'll find you there.

865
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:21,834
I love you.

866
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:37,100
I want the Joker.

867
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:39,977
From one professional to another...

868
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:42,688
...you're trying to scare somebody,
pick a better spot.

869
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:45,441
From this height,
the fall wouldn't kill me.

870
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,193
- I'm counting on it.
- Huh!

871
01:05:54,575 --> 01:05:57,703
- Where is he?
- I don't know where he is. He found us.

872
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,163
He must have friends.

873
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,791
Friends? Have you met this guy?

874
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,543
Someone knows where he is.

875
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:06,212
Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.

876
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:07,713
They're wise to your act.

877
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:11,884
You got rules.
The Joker, he's got no rules.

878
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:16,931
Nobody's gonna cross him for you.
If you want this guy, you got one way.

879
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:18,891
But you already know what that is.

880
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:21,853
Just take off that mask,
let him come find you.

881
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:27,567
Or you can let a couple more people
get killed while you make up your mind.

882
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:31,237
You wanna play games?

883
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:38,578
How's that feel?

884
01:06:38,744 --> 01:06:41,372
- You wouldn't.
- I wouldn't!

885
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:44,500
- You don't think I will?
- Mm-mm.

886
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,711
- You don't think I will?
- Mm-mm.

887
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:51,299
No. No, I wouldn't.

888
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:55,052
That's why I'm not
gonna leave it up to me.

889
01:06:56,053 --> 01:06:59,056
Heads, you get to keep your head.

890
01:06:59,474 --> 01:07:01,100
Tails...

891
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:03,102
...not so lucky.

892
01:07:03,478 --> 01:07:07,023
So you wanna tell me about the Joker?

893
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:20,119
- Let's go again.
- I don't know anything! God, don't!

894
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:22,663
You're not playing the odds, friend.

895
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:25,792
Let's do it again.

896
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:30,463
You'd leave a man's life to chance?

897
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:34,801
- Not exactly.
- His name's Schiff, Thomas.

898
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:37,970
He's a paranoid schizophrenic,
former patient at Arkham.

899
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:42,767
The kind of mind the Joker attracts.
What do you expect to learn from him?

900
01:07:46,104 --> 01:07:48,898
The Joker killed Gordon.
He's gonna kill Rachel.

901
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,859
You're the symbol of hope
I could never be.

902
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:53,861
Your stand against organized crime...

903
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:57,240
...is the first legitimate ray of light
in Gotham in decades.

904
01:07:57,406 --> 01:08:01,035
If anyone saw this,
everything would be undone.

905
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:03,496
The criminals you arrested
would be released...

906
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:06,749
...and Jim Gordon
will have died for nothing.

907
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,627
You're gonna hold
a press conference tomorrow.

908
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:12,171
- Why?
- No one else will die because of me.

909
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:14,674
Gotham's in your hands now.

910
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:16,551
You can't.

911
01:08:16,717 --> 01:08:18,094
You can't give in.

912
01:08:18,386 --> 01:08:20,930
You can't give in!

913
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:37,530
Harvey called.

914
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:40,741
He said Batman's gonna turn himself in.

915
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:42,034
I have no choice.

916
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:45,288
You honestly think that's gonna
keep the Joker from killing people?

917
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:48,916
Maybe not. But I have enough blood
on my hands.

918
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:54,213
And I've seen now what I would
have to become to stop men like him.

919
01:08:54,755 --> 01:08:58,217
You once told me that
if the day came when I was finished...

920
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:00,470
...that we'd be together.

921
01:09:01,179 --> 01:09:04,348
Bruce, don't make me
your one hope for a normal life.

922
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,226
Did you mean it?

923
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:10,563
Yes.

924
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,624
Bruce.

925
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:34,504
If you turn yourself in,
they're not gonna let us be together.

926
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:48,101
ALFRED: Logs as well?
BRUCE: Everything.

927
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:51,646
Anything that could lead back
to Lucius or Rachel.

928
01:09:56,984 --> 01:10:00,279
People are dying, Alfred.
What would you have me do?

929
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:04,200
Endure, Master Wayne. Take it.

930
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:08,079
They'll hate you for it,
but that's the point of Batman.

931
01:10:08,246 --> 01:10:13,793
He can be the outcast. He can make
the choice that no one else can make.

932
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,294
The right choice.

933
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:18,840
No, today I found out
what Batman can't do.

934
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:20,258
He can't endure this.

935
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:23,428
Today you get to say "I told you so."

936
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:27,181
Today, I don't want to.

937
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,480
But I did bloody tell you.

938
01:10:37,525 --> 01:10:40,528
ALFRED: I suppose they're gonna
lock me up as well...

939
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,572
...as your accomplice.

940
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:47,493
BRUCE: Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them
the whole thing was your idea.

941
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:55,293
Ladies and gentlemen, I've called
this press conference for two reasons.

942
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,503
Firstly, to assure the citizens
of Gotham...

943
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:01,340
...that everything that can be done
over the Joker killings is being done.

944
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:05,803
Secondly, because the Batman
has offered to turn himself in.

945
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,680
But let's consider the situation.

946
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:10,683
Should we give in
to this terrorist's demands?

947
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,310
Do we really think he's gonna...?

948
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:15,855
You'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante
than the lives of citizens?

949
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:18,399
The Batman is an outlaw.

950
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:21,194
That's not why we demand
he turn himself in...

951
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,069
...we're doing it because we're scared.

952
01:11:23,236 --> 01:11:26,030
We've been happy to let Batman
clean up our streets till now.

953
01:11:26,197 --> 01:11:29,158
MAN 1: Things are worse than ever!
MAN 2: Amen.

954
01:11:30,493 --> 01:11:32,411
Yes, they are.

955
01:11:34,914 --> 01:11:37,917
But the night is darkest
just before the dawn.

956
01:11:40,378 --> 01:11:42,463
And I promise you...

957
01:11:43,256 --> 01:11:44,674
...the dawn is coming.

958
01:11:44,841 --> 01:11:49,387
One day, the Batman will have to answer
for the laws he's broken. But to us...

959
01:11:49,554 --> 01:11:51,305
...not to this madman.

960
01:11:51,472 --> 01:11:53,808
- No more dead cops!
OFFICERS: Yeah!

961
01:11:57,103 --> 01:11:58,688
He should turn himself in!

962
01:11:58,855 --> 01:12:01,566
MAN 3: Give us the Batman! Come on!
MAN 4: Where is he?

963
01:12:04,443 --> 01:12:06,612
So be it. Take the Batman into custody.

964
01:12:07,071 --> 01:12:09,031
WOMAN: What?
MAN 5: Is he here?

965
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:10,783
I am the Batman.

966
01:12:11,117 --> 01:12:14,120
MAN 6: What?
MAN 7: Come on.

967
01:12:22,503 --> 01:12:24,422
RACHEL:
Alfred.

968
01:12:25,756 --> 01:12:27,550
Why is he letting Harvey do this?

969
01:12:27,717 --> 01:12:30,720
- He went down to the press conference.
- I know. He just stood by.

970
01:12:30,887 --> 01:12:32,972
Perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent...

971
01:12:33,139 --> 01:12:36,142
...believe that Batman stands for
something more important...

972
01:12:36,309 --> 01:12:38,644
...than the whims of a terrorist,
Miss Dawes...

973
01:12:38,811 --> 01:12:40,813
...even if everyone hates him for it.

974
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:43,107
That's the sacrifice he's making.

975
01:12:43,274 --> 01:12:46,903
He's not being a hero.
He's being something more.

976
01:12:47,445 --> 01:12:49,071
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

977
01:12:49,238 --> 01:12:52,325
Letting Harvey take the fall for this
is not heroic at all.

978
01:12:54,994 --> 01:12:56,621
You know him better than anyone.

979
01:12:57,038 --> 01:12:58,080
I do.

980
01:13:01,459 --> 01:13:04,504
Will you give this to him for me?
When the time is right?

981
01:13:05,963 --> 01:13:07,173
How will I know?

982
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:08,841
It's not sealed.

983
01:13:10,259 --> 01:13:11,803
Goodbye, Alfred.

984
01:13:15,973 --> 01:13:17,725
Bye, Rachel.

985
01:13:25,608 --> 01:13:27,443
I didn't have time to talk this through.

986
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:28,861
What are you doing?

987
01:13:29,028 --> 01:13:31,113
They're transferring me
to Central Holding.

988
01:13:31,405 --> 01:13:35,076
This is the Joker's chance, and when he
attacks, the Batman will take him down.

989
01:13:35,243 --> 01:13:36,786
Listen. This is too dangerous.

990
01:13:36,953 --> 01:13:40,665
We get this guy to County, he's their
problem. The streets will be cleared...

991
01:13:40,832 --> 01:13:44,544
...so let's go.
The convoys stop for no reason.

992
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:46,170
I hope you got some moves, pal.

993
01:13:46,337 --> 01:13:49,257
He's using you as bait. He doesn't
know if he can get the Joker.

994
01:13:49,423 --> 01:13:50,508
He's failed so far.

995
01:13:50,842 --> 01:13:52,385
How do you know
what he's thinking?

996
01:13:52,552 --> 01:13:54,887
I just do. Anyway,
this isn't just about you.

997
01:13:55,054 --> 01:13:56,889
What about the people
depending on you...

998
01:13:57,056 --> 01:14:00,059
...to clean the city up
and do it honorably and...?

999
01:14:05,731 --> 01:14:08,359
Harvey. Tell everyone the truth.

1000
01:14:08,734 --> 01:14:10,611
Heads, I go through with it.

1001
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:12,738
This is your life. You can't leave...

1002
01:14:12,905 --> 01:14:15,283
...something like that to chance.
- I'm not.

1003
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:22,039
You make your own luck.

1004
01:14:43,853 --> 01:14:45,855
Hey, you wait like everybody else, pal.

1005
01:14:53,488 --> 01:14:55,823
What the hell is that?

1006
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:58,201
Obstruction ahead, obstruction ahead!

1007
01:14:58,367 --> 01:15:01,579
Damn it! All units divert down
onto Lower Fifth. I repeat, exit down.

1008
01:15:01,996 --> 01:15:03,122
Exit down!

1009
01:15:03,289 --> 01:15:05,625
Lower Fifth? We'll be
like turkeys on Thanksgiving.

1010
01:15:38,324 --> 01:15:40,660
Jesus. Come on, get us out of here.
Let's go.

1011
01:15:42,829 --> 01:15:45,206
Listen, we need backup.
We've got company.

1012
01:15:45,373 --> 01:15:46,916
We got trouble, guys.

1013
01:15:49,836 --> 01:15:50,920
Lock and load!

1014
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:03,516
The hell was that?

1015
01:16:25,371 --> 01:16:28,040
- These are built for that, right?
- He'll need something...

1016
01:16:28,207 --> 01:16:30,001
...a lot bigger to get through this.

1017
01:16:31,043 --> 01:16:32,503
What is that?

1018
01:16:33,838 --> 01:16:35,173
What is that, a bazooka?

1019
01:16:43,806 --> 01:16:45,516
I didn't sign up for this!

1020
01:17:01,866 --> 01:17:03,201
Look out.

1021
01:17:03,993 --> 01:17:05,161
Look out!

1022
01:17:27,433 --> 01:17:28,559
Come on, let's go!

1023
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:17,330
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent.

1024
01:18:17,497 --> 01:18:20,333
Oh, excuse me. I wanna drive.

1025
01:18:25,255 --> 01:18:28,842
COMPUTER: Scanning all systems.
Scanning all systems.

1026
01:18:36,307 --> 01:18:38,434
We gotta get topside.
We need air support, now!

1027
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:45,817
I like this job. I like it.

1028
01:18:48,069 --> 01:18:50,697
COMPUTER: Damage catastrophic.
Eject sequence initiated.

1029
01:19:04,669 --> 01:19:06,171
Goodbye.

1030
01:19:15,263 --> 01:19:18,474
We're on point, ready to give them
some of their own medicine.

1031
01:19:24,856 --> 01:19:27,317
That's what I'm talking about. Air cav.

1032
01:19:40,872 --> 01:19:42,582
Okay, rack them up.

1033
01:19:42,749 --> 01:19:45,126
Rack them up, rack them up,
rack them up.

1034
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:12,028
That's not good.

1035
01:20:15,532 --> 01:20:16,741
Okay, that's not good!

1036
01:20:59,868 --> 01:21:01,953
Now, there's a Batman.

1037
01:21:06,249 --> 01:21:07,458
Ooh, you wanna play. Come on.

1038
01:21:10,378 --> 01:21:11,504
Come on.

1039
01:21:20,638 --> 01:21:21,890
He missed!

1040
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:38,239
You can't stop here.
We're like sitting ducks!

1041
01:21:55,256 --> 01:21:56,341
Come on, come on.

1042
01:21:59,469 --> 01:22:02,847
Come on. Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on!

1043
01:22:05,391 --> 01:22:06,851
Come on.

1044
01:22:07,519 --> 01:22:10,855
Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on, hit me.

1045
01:22:11,022 --> 01:22:12,649
Come on, hit me. Come on, hit me!

1046
01:22:14,776 --> 01:22:15,818
Hit me!

1047
01:22:40,802 --> 01:22:44,055
Come on, come on. Aah!

1048
01:22:44,222 --> 01:22:46,474
Could you please just give me a minute?

1049
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:50,395
We got you, you son of a bitch.

1050
01:22:53,690 --> 01:22:57,610
Gor... You do like to play things
pretty close to the chest.

1051
01:22:58,069 --> 01:22:59,779
We got him, Harvey.

1052
01:22:59,946 --> 01:23:03,408
REPORTER 1: Mr. Dent! How does it feel
to be the biggest hero in Gotham?

1053
01:23:03,575 --> 01:23:06,870
No, I'm no hero.
Gotham's finest, they're the heroes.

1054
01:23:07,036 --> 01:23:08,371
REPORTER 1: But you and your office...

1055
01:23:08,538 --> 01:23:10,206
...have been working
with the Batman all along.

1056
01:23:10,373 --> 01:23:12,167
No, but I trusted him
to do the right thing.

1057
01:23:12,333 --> 01:23:14,419
REPORTER 2: Which was?
- Saving my ass.

1058
01:23:14,586 --> 01:23:17,505
All right, people, that's enough.
Let him be. Let him be.

1059
01:23:17,672 --> 01:23:19,591
Thank you, detective.

1060
01:23:19,799 --> 01:23:21,926
I've got a date
with a pretty upset girlfriend.

1061
01:23:22,093 --> 01:23:24,470
- I figured, counselor.
REPORTER 3: Mr. Dent, sir...

1062
01:23:24,637 --> 01:23:28,766
...how about one for the front page, sir?
REPORTER 4: Mr. Dent.

1063
01:23:40,111 --> 01:23:43,281
Stand away! All of you!

1064
01:23:43,448 --> 01:23:46,951
I don't want anything for his Mob lawyer
to use, you understand?

1065
01:23:49,204 --> 01:23:51,080
Back from the dead.

1066
01:23:51,748 --> 01:23:53,291
I, uh...

1067
01:23:53,458 --> 01:23:55,376
...couldn't risk my family's safety.

1068
01:23:56,669 --> 01:23:58,505
MAYOR:
What do we got?

1069
01:24:00,173 --> 01:24:04,135
Nothing. No matches on prints,
DNA, dental.

1070
01:24:04,302 --> 01:24:07,055
Clothing is custom, no labels.

1071
01:24:07,263 --> 01:24:09,390
Nothing in his pockets
but knives and lint.

1072
01:24:09,557 --> 01:24:11,476
No name.

1073
01:24:11,809 --> 01:24:13,770
- No other alias.
MAYOR: Go home, Gordon.

1074
01:24:13,937 --> 01:24:17,023
The clown'll keep till morning.
Go get some rest.

1075
01:24:17,190 --> 01:24:19,025
You're gonna need it.

1076
01:24:19,275 --> 01:24:21,861
Tomorrow you take the big job.

1077
01:24:22,529 --> 01:24:25,698
You don't have any say in the matter.
Commissioner Gordon.

1078
01:24:41,548 --> 01:24:43,675
I'm sorry, I couldn't risk your safety.

1079
01:24:50,181 --> 01:24:51,599
MURPHY:
Look at these ugly bastards.

1080
01:24:51,766 --> 01:24:53,643
- I don't feel good.
MURPHY: You're a cop killer.

1081
01:24:53,810 --> 01:24:56,145
You're lucky to be feeling anything
below the neck.

1082
01:24:56,312 --> 01:24:57,897
- Please!
- Step away from the bars!

1083
01:24:58,064 --> 01:25:00,233
THUG:
My insides hurt.

1084
01:25:14,414 --> 01:25:16,207
Did Batman save you, Daddy?

1085
01:25:18,376 --> 01:25:20,670
Actually, this time...

1086
01:25:20,837 --> 01:25:23,006
...I saved him.

1087
01:25:34,350 --> 01:25:35,977
GORDON:
Has he said anything yet?

1088
01:25:43,568 --> 01:25:47,780
Evening, commissioner.

1089
01:25:55,413 --> 01:25:57,624
Harvey Dent never made it home.

1090
01:25:57,790 --> 01:25:59,918
- Of course not.
- What have you done with him?

1091
01:26:00,835 --> 01:26:02,587
Me?

1092
01:26:04,214 --> 01:26:06,341
I was right here.

1093
01:26:07,759 --> 01:26:09,594
Who did you leave him with?

1094
01:26:09,761 --> 01:26:12,597
Hm? Your people?

1095
01:26:13,723 --> 01:26:17,060
Assuming, of course,
that they are still your people...

1096
01:26:17,227 --> 01:26:19,938
...and not Maroni's.

1097
01:26:22,148 --> 01:26:24,526
Does it depress you, commissioner...

1098
01:26:24,943 --> 01:26:29,906
...to know just how alone you really are?

1099
01:26:31,908 --> 01:26:36,788
Does it make you feel responsible
for Harvey Dent's current predicament?

1100
01:26:36,955 --> 01:26:39,624
- Where is he?
- What's the time?

1101
01:26:40,124 --> 01:26:41,626
What difference does that make?

1102
01:26:41,876 --> 01:26:47,340
Well, depending on the time,
he may be in one spot or several.

1103
01:26:53,721 --> 01:26:56,683
- Lf we're gonna play games...
- Mm-hm?

1104
01:26:59,853 --> 01:27:01,813
...I'm gonna need a cup of coffee.

1105
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:06,067
Ah, the "good cop, bad cop" routine?

1106
01:27:06,734 --> 01:27:07,777
Not exactly.

1107
01:27:18,288 --> 01:27:22,333
Never start with the head. The victim
gets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next...

1108
01:27:25,503 --> 01:27:26,629
See?

1109
01:27:26,796 --> 01:27:29,132
You wanted me. Here I am.

1110
01:27:30,175 --> 01:27:32,302
JOKER [OVER SPEAKER]:
I wanted to see what you'd do.

1111
01:27:32,844 --> 01:27:35,430
And you didn't disappoint.

1112
01:27:35,597 --> 01:27:38,433
You let five people die.

1113
01:27:39,392 --> 01:27:43,062
Then you let Dent take your place.

1114
01:27:43,229 --> 01:27:45,857
- Even to a guy like me, that's cold.
- Where's Dent?

1115
01:27:46,024 --> 01:27:50,820
Those Mob fools want you gone so they
can get back to the way things were.

1116
01:27:51,321 --> 01:27:56,075
But I know the truth. There's no
going back. You've changed things.

1117
01:27:56,242 --> 01:27:58,661
- Forever.
- Then why do you wanna kill me?

1118
01:28:01,623 --> 01:28:03,041
I don't wanna kill you.

1119
01:28:03,541 --> 01:28:08,087
What would I do without you? Go back
to ripping off Mob dealers? No, no.

1120
01:28:08,254 --> 01:28:10,632
No. No, you...

1121
01:28:10,798 --> 01:28:13,218
You complete me.

1122
01:28:13,384 --> 01:28:17,722
- You're garbage who kills for money.
- Don't talk like one of them. You're not.

1123
01:28:17,889 --> 01:28:20,308
Even if you'd like to be.

1124
01:28:21,559 --> 01:28:23,394
To them, you're just a freak...

1125
01:28:24,312 --> 01:28:25,647
...like me.

1126
01:28:25,813 --> 01:28:28,107
They need you right now...

1127
01:28:28,691 --> 01:28:30,735
...but when they don't...

1128
01:28:31,277 --> 01:28:34,322
...they'll cast you out like a leper.

1129
01:28:34,489 --> 01:28:38,409
You see, their morals, their code...

1130
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:40,829
...it's a bad joke.

1131
01:28:41,079 --> 01:28:44,415
Dropped at the first sign of trouble.

1132
01:28:45,083 --> 01:28:49,087
They're only as good as the world
allows them to be. I'll show you.

1133
01:28:49,254 --> 01:28:52,423
When the chips are down, these...

1134
01:28:52,590 --> 01:28:54,843
These civilized people...

1135
01:28:55,009 --> 01:28:57,095
...they'll eat each other.

1136
01:28:57,804 --> 01:29:00,181
See, I'm not a monster.

1137
01:29:01,558 --> 01:29:02,851
I'm just ahead of the curve.

1138
01:29:05,103 --> 01:29:06,187
Where's Dent?

1139
01:29:06,354 --> 01:29:09,274
You have all these rules,
and you think they'll save you.

1140
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:14,779
- He's in control.
- I have one rule.

1141
01:29:14,946 --> 01:29:18,032
Oh. Then that's the rule you'll have
to break to know the truth.

1142
01:29:18,199 --> 01:29:19,367
Which is?

1143
01:29:19,534 --> 01:29:21,953
The only sensible way to live
is without rules.

1144
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:24,789
And tonight you're gonna break
your one rule.

1145
01:29:24,956 --> 01:29:25,999
I'm considering it.

1146
01:29:26,166 --> 01:29:28,793
There's only minutes left,
so you'll have to play my game...

1147
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:31,546
...if you wanna save one of them.

1148
01:29:32,046 --> 01:29:33,089
"Them"?

1149
01:29:33,256 --> 01:29:37,302
You know, for a while there,
I thought you really were Dent.

1150
01:29:37,468 --> 01:29:40,096
The way you threw yourself after her.

1151
01:29:46,394 --> 01:29:47,478
Look at you go.

1152
01:29:53,109 --> 01:29:56,696
Does Harvey know
about you and his little bunny?

1153
01:29:57,614 --> 01:29:58,990
Where are they?!

1154
01:29:59,157 --> 01:30:01,159
Killing is making a choice.

1155
01:30:01,326 --> 01:30:04,412
- Where are they?!
- Choose between one life or the other.

1156
01:30:05,163 --> 01:30:09,417
Your friend the district attorney,
or his blushing bride-to-be.

1157
01:30:14,589 --> 01:30:18,676
You have nothing,
nothing to threaten me with.

1158
01:30:19,093 --> 01:30:22,597
Nothing to do with all your strength.

1159
01:30:22,805 --> 01:30:26,226
Don't worry, I'm gonna tell you
where they are, both of them.

1160
01:30:26,392 --> 01:30:29,437
And that's the point.
You'll have to choose.

1161
01:30:30,188 --> 01:30:33,024
He's at 25052nd Street...

1162
01:30:33,191 --> 01:30:36,528
...and she's on Avenue X at Cicero.

1163
01:30:38,613 --> 01:30:40,365
- Which one you going after?
- Rachel.

1164
01:30:41,783 --> 01:30:43,201
GORDON:
We're getting Dent!

1165
01:30:45,453 --> 01:30:48,289
25052nd Street!

1166
01:30:51,209 --> 01:30:53,044
RACHEL [OVER PHONE]:
Hello?

1167
01:30:54,003 --> 01:30:56,381
Can anybody hear me?

1168
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:01,427
Hello!

1169
01:31:05,431 --> 01:31:07,684
- Rachel?
- Harvey.

1170
01:31:07,851 --> 01:31:10,061
Oh, Harvey, thank God. Are you okay?

1171
01:31:10,228 --> 01:31:11,813
I'm all right. I'm in a...

1172
01:31:11,980 --> 01:31:15,567
I'm in a warehouse.
They got me wired to these oil drums.

1173
01:31:16,609 --> 01:31:17,819
I am too.

1174
01:31:18,361 --> 01:31:20,071
Harvey.

1175
01:31:27,328 --> 01:31:29,789
I want my phone call.

1176
01:31:29,956 --> 01:31:32,750
I want it. I want it.
I want my phone call.

1177
01:31:33,418 --> 01:31:35,253
That's nice.

1178
01:31:36,754 --> 01:31:41,593
How many of your friends have I killed?

1179
01:31:45,346 --> 01:31:46,431
I'm a 20-year man...

1180
01:31:46,598 --> 01:31:50,059
...and I know the difference between
punks who need a lesson in manners...

1181
01:31:50,226 --> 01:31:53,104
...and the freaks like you
who would just enjoy it.

1182
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:56,441
And you killed six of my friends.

1183
01:31:56,608 --> 01:31:57,650
[MOUTHS]
Six?

1184
01:31:57,817 --> 01:32:00,278
Please. My insides hurt.

1185
01:32:00,445 --> 01:32:02,197
I don't really care. Back away.

1186
01:32:02,363 --> 01:32:05,533
The boss said he'd make the voices
go away.

1187
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:09,245
He said he'd go inside
and replace them with bright lights...

1188
01:32:09,412 --> 01:32:10,538
...like Christmas.

1189
01:32:10,705 --> 01:32:13,249
You're out of your mind, pal. Back off.

1190
01:32:13,416 --> 01:32:16,252
Medic to the holding tank.
Come on. Get the door open.

1191
01:32:16,461 --> 01:32:17,629
You guys, back off!

1192
01:32:17,795 --> 01:32:19,964
Listen, we don't have a lot of time.

1193
01:32:20,131 --> 01:32:24,135
They told me that only one of us
was gonna make it...

1194
01:32:24,302 --> 01:32:27,639
...and that they were gonna
let our friends choose.

1195
01:32:30,350 --> 01:32:32,477
Okay, Rachel.

1196
01:32:33,061 --> 01:32:36,189
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be all right.
They're coming for you.

1197
01:32:36,356 --> 01:32:40,652
Listen to me. I'll help you. Just talk me
through what's going on with you.

1198
01:32:40,818 --> 01:32:42,737
Can you find something,
anything, sharp?

1199
01:32:42,904 --> 01:32:44,322
I'm trying.

1200
01:32:44,489 --> 01:32:46,658
- What's...?
- Shit.

1201
01:32:46,825 --> 01:32:48,326
Harvey?

1202
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:53,748
Harvey, what's happening?

1203
01:33:03,091 --> 01:33:06,928
All available units,
converge at 25052nd Street.

1204
01:33:07,262 --> 01:33:11,349
Do you wanna know why I use a knife?

1205
01:33:13,643 --> 01:33:14,978
Guns are too quick.

1206
01:33:15,144 --> 01:33:18,523
You can't savor all the...

1207
01:33:18,690 --> 01:33:22,026
...little emotions.

1208
01:33:23,945 --> 01:33:28,825
You see, in their last moments...

1209
01:33:28,992 --> 01:33:31,286
...people show you who they really are.

1210
01:33:32,370 --> 01:33:38,042
So in a way, I knew your friends
better than you ever did.

1211
01:33:41,796 --> 01:33:45,216
Would you like to know
which of them were cowards?

1212
01:33:51,723 --> 01:33:53,391
OFFICER: What's that?
MEDIC: Jeez.

1213
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:55,643
He's got some kind of a...

1214
01:33:55,810 --> 01:33:59,022
...contusion.
- I know you're gonna enjoy this.

1215
01:34:00,398 --> 01:34:04,152
I'm gonna have to try and enjoy it
even more.

1216
01:34:09,365 --> 01:34:10,658
OFFICER 1:
Whoa, whoa!

1217
01:34:11,701 --> 01:34:12,744
OFFICER 2:
Just put it down.

1218
01:34:12,911 --> 01:34:15,705
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Drop the weapon now!

1219
01:34:15,872 --> 01:34:19,834
- It's my own damn fault, just shoot him!
- Let him go now! Drop it!

1220
01:34:20,126 --> 01:34:23,129
- What? Sorry?
- What do you want?

1221
01:34:24,172 --> 01:34:26,090
I just want my phone call.

1222
01:34:29,093 --> 01:34:31,763
RACHEL:
What...? What...? What's happening?

1223
01:34:31,930 --> 01:34:34,766
Just talk to me, just for one second.

1224
01:34:37,101 --> 01:34:39,771
- All right?
- Right.

1225
01:34:41,689 --> 01:34:43,107
Ow.

1226
01:34:44,025 --> 01:34:45,610
- Ow.
- Shh, shh, shh.

1227
01:34:51,574 --> 01:34:53,618
Is that a phone?

1228
01:35:03,294 --> 01:35:04,629
Mount the curb!

1229
01:35:12,637 --> 01:35:16,641
Harvey, just in case,
I wanna tell you something, okay?

1230
01:35:16,808 --> 01:35:18,601
Don 't think like that. They're coming.

1231
01:35:18,768 --> 01:35:21,062
I know they are,
but I don't want them to.

1232
01:35:25,483 --> 01:35:29,571
I don't wanna live without you,
and I do have an answer for you.

1233
01:35:29,988 --> 01:35:31,739
My answer is yes.

1234
01:35:34,492 --> 01:35:37,245
No! No! No!

1235
01:35:37,412 --> 01:35:40,039
Not me! Why are you coming for me?

1236
01:35:40,206 --> 01:35:41,249
No!

1237
01:35:42,917 --> 01:35:44,502
Rachel! Rachel!

1238
01:35:44,711 --> 01:35:47,046
- Harvey.
- No! No! Rachel!

1239
01:35:47,213 --> 01:35:48,256
Okay.

1240
01:35:48,423 --> 01:35:49,507
Rachel!

1241
01:35:49,924 --> 01:35:51,467
No! No!

1242
01:35:51,634 --> 01:35:55,763
Harvey, it's okay. It's all right. Listen.

1243
01:35:55,930 --> 01:35:57,265
Somewh...

1244
01:36:03,146 --> 01:36:04,355
RAMIREZ:
No, commissioner!

1245
01:36:04,522 --> 01:36:07,192
Rachel! No!

1246
01:36:21,539 --> 01:36:22,665
Hello there.

1247
01:36:28,546 --> 01:36:32,050
SERGEANT:
Back at the MCU, the Joker's gone.

1248
01:36:32,967 --> 01:36:34,677
With Lau?

1249
01:36:37,472 --> 01:36:40,058
The Joker planned to be caught.

1250
01:36:40,391 --> 01:36:42,560
He wanted me to lock him up
in the MCU.

1251
01:37:02,205 --> 01:37:04,249
RACHEL:
Dear Bruce:

1252
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,545
I need to be honest and clear.

1253
01:37:10,588 --> 01:37:13,132
I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.

1254
01:37:13,299 --> 01:37:17,220
I love him, and I wanna spend
the rest of my life with him.

1255
01:37:17,762 --> 01:37:22,183
When I told you that if Gotham no longer
needed Batman, we could be together...

1256
01:37:22,350 --> 01:37:24,561
...I meant it.

1257
01:37:24,811 --> 01:37:29,566
But now I'm sure the day won 't come
when you no longer need Batman.

1258
01:37:30,608 --> 01:37:32,527
I hope it does.

1259
01:37:32,694 --> 01:37:35,446
And if it does, I will be there...

1260
01:37:35,989 --> 01:37:37,407
...but as your friend.

1261
01:37:38,116 --> 01:37:40,368
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1262
01:37:40,535 --> 01:37:42,912
RACHEL:
I'm sorry to let you down.

1263
01:37:43,079 --> 01:37:48,084
If you lose your faith in me,
please keep your faith in people.

1264
01:37:48,668 --> 01:37:53,089
Love, now and always, Rachel.

1265
01:38:01,055 --> 01:38:03,391
ALFRED:
Prepared a little breakfast.

1266
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:09,439
- Very well, then.
- Alfred.

1267
01:38:09,606 --> 01:38:10,773
Yes, Master Wayne?

1268
01:38:12,150 --> 01:38:14,402
Did I bring this on her?

1269
01:38:15,445 --> 01:38:17,655
I was meant to inspire good...

1270
01:38:17,822 --> 01:38:20,200
...not madness, not death.

1271
01:38:20,366 --> 01:38:24,996
You have inspired good. But you spat
in the faces of Gotham's criminals.

1272
01:38:25,163 --> 01:38:27,248
Didn't you think
there might be casualties?

1273
01:38:27,415 --> 01:38:29,834
Things always get worse
before they get better.

1274
01:38:30,168 --> 01:38:31,628
But Rachel, Alfred.

1275
01:38:31,794 --> 01:38:35,590
Rachel believed in what you stood for...

1276
01:38:35,757 --> 01:38:37,675
...what we stand for.

1277
01:38:37,842 --> 01:38:39,302
Gotham needs you.

1278
01:38:39,844 --> 01:38:42,805
No, Gotham needs its true hero...

1279
01:38:43,306 --> 01:38:47,435
...and I let that murdering psychopath
blow him half to hell.

1280
01:38:47,602 --> 01:38:49,938
Which is why, for now...

1281
01:38:50,730 --> 01:38:52,649
...they're gonna have to
make do with you.

1282
01:38:54,859 --> 01:38:56,694
She was gonna wait for me, Alfred.

1283
01:38:58,696 --> 01:39:00,740
Dent doesn't know.

1284
01:39:00,907 --> 01:39:02,200
He can never know.

1285
01:39:04,619 --> 01:39:06,246
What's that?

1286
01:39:06,412 --> 01:39:09,374
- It can wait.
- That bandit...

1287
01:39:09,825 --> 01:39:11,952
...in the forest in Burma.

1288
01:39:12,118 --> 01:39:14,162
- Did you catch him?
- Yes.

1289
01:39:14,329 --> 01:39:15,664
How?

1290
01:39:17,082 --> 01:39:18,708
We burned the forest down.

1291
01:39:57,956 --> 01:40:00,584
He's credible, an M & A lawyer
from a leading consultancy.

1292
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:04,129
He says he's waited as long as he can
for Batman to do the right thing.

1293
01:40:04,296 --> 01:40:06,381
Now he's taking matters
into his own hands.

1294
01:40:06,548 --> 01:40:09,509
We'll be live at 5 with
the true identity of the Batman.

1295
01:40:25,942 --> 01:40:27,569
I'm sorry about Rachel.

1296
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:35,118
The doctor says you're in agonizing pain,
but that you won't accept medication.

1297
01:40:36,161 --> 01:40:38,121
That you're refusing to...

1298
01:40:38,288 --> 01:40:40,040
...accept skin grafts.

1299
01:40:40,373 --> 01:40:42,626
Remember that name...

1300
01:40:43,210 --> 01:40:45,545
...you all had for me...

1301
01:40:46,004 --> 01:40:48,840
...when I was at Internal Affairs?

1302
01:40:51,301 --> 01:40:52,594
What was it, Gordon?

1303
01:40:53,261 --> 01:40:54,638
Harvey, I...

1304
01:40:54,804 --> 01:40:56,306
Say it.

1305
01:40:57,724 --> 01:40:59,643
Say it!

1306
01:41:07,317 --> 01:41:10,403
Two-Face. Harvey Two-Face.

1307
01:41:11,988 --> 01:41:16,284
Why should I hide who I am?

1308
01:41:17,494 --> 01:41:18,829
I know you tried to warn me.

1309
01:41:19,704 --> 01:41:20,914
I'm sorry.

1310
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:24,167
Wuertz picked you up.
Was he working for them?

1311
01:41:26,461 --> 01:41:28,839
Do you know who picked up Rachel?

1312
01:41:29,673 --> 01:41:32,676
Harvey, I need to know
which of my men I can trust.

1313
01:41:33,051 --> 01:41:35,178
Why would you listen to me now?

1314
01:41:36,304 --> 01:41:37,973
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1315
01:41:40,517 --> 01:41:42,310
No.

1316
01:41:42,769 --> 01:41:44,896
No, you're not.

1317
01:41:45,939 --> 01:41:47,190
Not yet.

1318
01:41:52,445 --> 01:41:55,157
This craziness, it's too much.

1319
01:41:55,365 --> 01:41:58,618
Should've thought about that
before you let the clown out of the box.

1320
01:41:58,785 --> 01:42:00,537
MARONl:
You want him?

1321
01:42:02,998 --> 01:42:05,333
I can tell you
where he'll be this afternoon.

1322
01:42:13,383 --> 01:42:15,677
CHECHEN:
Not so crazy as you look.

1323
01:42:15,844 --> 01:42:19,598
I told you, I'm a man of my word.

1324
01:42:22,809 --> 01:42:24,060
Where is the Italian?

1325
01:42:24,227 --> 01:42:27,355
All tactical units will converge
on the location in 20 minutes.

1326
01:42:27,522 --> 01:42:30,984
I want auxiliary units to cover
all possible getaway routes.

1327
01:42:31,568 --> 01:42:32,736
CHECHEN:
Please.

1328
01:42:32,903 --> 01:42:36,239
Joker-man, what you do
with all your money?

1329
01:42:36,907 --> 01:42:39,576
You see, I'm a guy of simple taste.

1330
01:42:39,743 --> 01:42:41,411
I enjoy...

1331
01:42:41,578 --> 01:42:42,954
...dynamite...

1332
01:42:43,121 --> 01:42:44,664
...and gunpowder...

1333
01:42:45,123 --> 01:42:47,542
...and gasoline.

1334
01:42:49,002 --> 01:42:51,254
- What the...?
- Ah, ah, ah.

1335
01:42:53,089 --> 01:42:55,926
And you know the thing
that they have in common?

1336
01:42:56,426 --> 01:42:57,719
They're cheap.

1337
01:42:57,886 --> 01:43:00,555
CALLER 1 [ON TV]: How much are they
paying you to say who Batman is?

1338
01:43:00,722 --> 01:43:04,684
This is our chance. I want Lau alive.
The Joker, either way.

1339
01:43:04,851 --> 01:43:06,269
Hey, Jim. Get a load of this.

1340
01:43:06,436 --> 01:43:07,771
ENGEL:
Let's take the next caller.

1341
01:43:07,938 --> 01:43:10,106
CALLER 2: Harvey Dent didn 't wanna
give in to this maniac.

1342
01:43:10,273 --> 01:43:11,566
You think you know better?

1343
01:43:11,733 --> 01:43:15,111
I think that if we could talk to Dent
today, he may feel differently.

1344
01:43:15,278 --> 01:43:19,366
And we wish him a speedy recovery.
Because God knows, we need him now.

1345
01:43:19,533 --> 01:43:21,743
You said you were a man of your word.

1346
01:43:22,035 --> 01:43:24,079
Oh, I am.

1347
01:43:25,789 --> 01:43:28,458
I'm only burning my half.

1348
01:43:29,793 --> 01:43:31,920
All you care about is money.

1349
01:43:32,087 --> 01:43:35,549
This town deserves
a better class of criminal...

1350
01:43:35,715 --> 01:43:37,968
...and I'm gonna give it to them.

1351
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:41,263
Tell your men they work for me now.

1352
01:43:41,429 --> 01:43:43,807
This is my city.

1353
01:43:44,474 --> 01:43:47,018
They won't work for a freak.

1354
01:43:47,185 --> 01:43:48,895
[IMITATES CHECHEN]
"Freak."

1355
01:43:49,062 --> 01:43:51,523
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Why don't we
cut you up into little pieces...

1356
01:43:51,690 --> 01:43:53,150
...and feed you to your pooches? Hm?

1357
01:43:53,316 --> 01:43:56,194
And then we'll see how loyal
a hungry dog really is.

1358
01:43:58,196 --> 01:44:00,532
It's not about money...

1359
01:44:00,699 --> 01:44:03,910
...it's about sending a message.

1360
01:44:04,703 --> 01:44:07,164
Everything burns.

1361
01:44:09,666 --> 01:44:11,835
- Who is this?
JOKER: I had a vision...

1362
01:44:12,002 --> 01:44:14,754
...of a world without Batman.

1363
01:44:14,921 --> 01:44:17,174
The Mob ground out a little profit...

1364
01:44:17,340 --> 01:44:21,261
...and the police tried to shut them down
one block at a time.

1365
01:44:21,428 --> 01:44:24,723
And it was so boring.

1366
01:44:24,890 --> 01:44:26,850
I've had a change of heart.

1367
01:44:27,017 --> 01:44:29,644
I don 't want Mr. Reese
spoiling everything...

1368
01:44:29,811 --> 01:44:34,524
...but why should I have all the fun?
Let's give someone else a chance.

1369
01:44:34,691 --> 01:44:39,529
If Coleman Reese
isn 't dead in 60 minutes...

1370
01:44:39,696 --> 01:44:41,781
...then I blow up a hospital.

1371
01:44:41,948 --> 01:44:43,533
Call in every officer.

1372
01:44:43,700 --> 01:44:47,037
Tell them to head to their nearest
hospital and start evac and search.

1373
01:44:47,204 --> 01:44:49,331
Call the transit authority,
school board, prisons.

1374
01:44:49,498 --> 01:44:51,124
Get every bus down to a hospital.

1375
01:44:51,291 --> 01:44:55,879
The priority is Gotham General. Wheel
everybody out of that place right now.

1376
01:44:56,046 --> 01:44:57,714
You, you and you, you come with me.

1377
01:44:57,881 --> 01:44:59,758
- Where are we going, sir?
- To get Reese.

1378
01:45:00,091 --> 01:45:03,178
I need you plugged in, checking
Gordon's men and their families.

- Looking for?
- Hospital admissions.

Will you be wanting the Batpod?

1381

In the middle of the day?
Not very subtle.

1382
01:45:09,684 --> 01:45:10,977
The Lamborghini, then.

1383
01:45:11,895 --> 01:45:13,021
Much more subtle.

1384
01:45:26,868 --> 01:45:29,371
Excuse me. Let me through.
Excuse me. Okay.

1385
01:45:29,538 --> 01:45:33,041
Sir, could you help, please?

1386
01:45:33,208 --> 01:45:34,918

...an ordinary citizen

01:45:50,016 --> 01:45:52,227
Get the cars around the back!

1391
01:45:54,604 --> 01:45:55,939
Go. Keep rolling, Sam.

1392
01:46:01,903 --> 01:46:03,864
I see O'Brien and Richards.

1393
01:46:04,447 --> 01:46:07,951
No immediate family member
admitted to a Gotham hospital.

1394
01:46:09,244 --> 01:46:12,789
REESE: They're trying to kill me.
- Well, maybe Batman can save you.

1395
01:46:25,927 --> 01:46:28,555
Davis, they got space. Bring him out.

1396
01:46:30,223 --> 01:46:32,017
Davis.

1397
01:46:37,147 --> 01:46:39,483
I saw Burns and Zachary.

1398
01:46:39,649 --> 01:46:40,859
ALFRED:
Nothing on them.

1399
01:46:41,026 --> 01:46:42,486
And a patrolman I don't know.

1400
01:46:43,695 --> 01:46:45,614
REESE:
Okay, so, what now?

1401
01:46:46,490 --> 01:46:48,742
What do we do now?
Where are we going?

1402
01:46:51,495 --> 01:46:53,163
Send the information to Gordon.

1403
01:47:01,046 --> 01:47:02,589
Get out of here.

1404
01:47:04,633 --> 01:47:06,426
Davis.

1405
01:47:09,596 --> 01:47:12,015
Ma'am, we're gonna have to
move him now.

1406
01:47:23,693 --> 01:47:26,029
GORDON: It's Berg, isn't it?
- Commissioner.

1407
01:47:27,155 --> 01:47:28,615
You okay, son?

1408
01:47:46,633 --> 01:47:48,218
Hi.

1409
01:47:53,056 --> 01:47:54,558
You know...

1410
01:47:55,392 --> 01:47:58,478
...I don't want there to be
any hard feelings between us, Harvey.

1411
01:47:58,645 --> 01:48:01,773
- When you and...
- Rachel!

1412
01:48:01,940 --> 01:48:04,234
- Rachel were being abducted...

1413
01:48:04,401 --> 01:48:07,404
...I was sitting in Gordon's cage.

1414
01:48:07,737 --> 01:48:09,656
I didn't rig those charges.

1415
01:48:09,865 --> 01:48:12,325
Your men, your plan.

1416
01:48:12,534 --> 01:48:14,995
Do I really look like a guy with a plan?

1417
01:48:15,412 --> 01:48:18,206
You know what I am?
I'm a dog chasing cars.

1418
01:48:18,832 --> 01:48:21,293
I wouldn't know what to do with one
if I caught it.

1419
01:48:21,459 --> 01:48:24,588
You know? I just do things.

1420
01:48:24,963 --> 01:48:28,675
The Mob has plans. The cops have plans.

1421
01:48:28,842 --> 01:48:31,052
Gordon's got plans.

1422
01:48:31,219 --> 01:48:34,181
You know, they're schemers.

1423
01:48:34,347 --> 01:48:38,101
Schemers trying to control
their little worlds.

1424
01:48:38,268 --> 01:48:39,769
I'm not a schemer.

1425
01:48:39,936 --> 01:48:41,563
I try to show the schemers...

1426
01:48:41,730 --> 01:48:47,027
...how pathetic their attempts
to control things really are.

1427
01:48:47,986 --> 01:48:51,031
So when I say... Ah. Come here.

1428
01:48:51,531 --> 01:48:55,076
When I say that you and your girlfriend
was nothing personal...

1429
01:48:56,620 --> 01:48:58,830
...you'll know that I'm telling the truth.

1430
01:49:01,333 --> 01:49:04,127
- I'm gonna need your weapon.
- What?

1431
01:49:07,881 --> 01:49:09,716
Why? Because my wife's in the hospital?

1432
01:49:10,425 --> 01:49:11,968
Yeah, that'd be why.

1433
01:49:12,886 --> 01:49:16,097
It's the schemers
that put you where you are.

1434
01:49:16,264 --> 01:49:20,060
You were a schemer, you had plans...

1435
01:49:20,227 --> 01:49:22,395
...and look where that got you.

1436
01:49:33,156 --> 01:49:35,534
ANNOUNCER [OVER RADIO]:
Police are taking every precaution...

1437
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:37,828
...urging people not to
take matters into their hands.

1438
01:49:37,994 --> 01:49:40,539
I just did what I do best.

1439
01:49:40,705 --> 01:49:44,334
I took your little plan
and I turned it on itself.

1440
01:49:44,501 --> 01:49:49,840
Look what I did to this city with a few
drums of gas and a couple of bullets.

1441
01:49:50,006 --> 01:49:53,301
Hm? You know what I noticed?

1442
01:49:53,468 --> 01:49:57,013
Nobody panics when
things go "according to plan."

1443
01:49:57,180 --> 01:49:58,849
Even if the plan is horrifying.

1444
01:49:59,474 --> 01:50:04,521
If tomorrow I tell the press that, like,
a gangbanger will get shot...

1445
01:50:04,688 --> 01:50:08,150
...or a truckload of soldiers
will be blowing up...

1446
01:50:08,441 --> 01:50:09,526
...nobody panics.

1447
01:50:10,235 --> 01:50:13,321
Because it's all part of the plan.

1448
01:50:13,488 --> 01:50:18,410
But when I say that
one little old mayor will die...

1449
01:50:18,660 --> 01:50:21,079
...well, then, everyone loses their minds.

1450
01:50:24,499 --> 01:50:27,419
Introduce a little anarchy...

1451
01:50:28,587 --> 01:50:30,839
...upset the established order...

1452
01:50:31,006 --> 01:50:35,552
...and everything becomes chaos.

1453
01:50:37,387 --> 01:50:40,140
I'm an agent of chaos.

1454
01:50:40,515 --> 01:50:42,851
Oh, and you know the thing
about chaos?

1455
01:50:44,895 --> 01:50:46,521
It's fair.

1456
01:50:55,739 --> 01:50:58,909
- You live.
- Mm-hm.

1457
01:50:59,409 --> 01:51:01,036
You die.

1458
01:51:01,244 --> 01:51:03,246
Mmm. Now we're talking.

1459
01:51:12,589 --> 01:51:14,090
Mr. Reese.

1460
01:51:32,275 --> 01:51:34,444
That's Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

1461
01:51:34,611 --> 01:51:37,614
- That was a very brave thing you did.
- Trying to catch the light?

1462
01:51:37,948 --> 01:51:40,784
- You weren't protecting the van?
- Why? Who's in it?

1463
01:51:46,248 --> 01:51:48,333
Don't you think
I should go to the hospital?

1464
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:51,002
Don't watch a whole lot of news,
do you, Mr. Wayne?

1465
01:52:57,152 --> 01:52:58,987
Southeast.

1466
01:52:59,154 --> 01:53:01,364
It's Gotham General.

1467
01:53:02,115 --> 01:53:03,783
- Did you clear the building?
OFFICER: Yeah.

1468
01:53:06,786 --> 01:53:08,497
GORDON: You must know
how many were inside.

1469
01:53:08,663 --> 01:53:10,040
You have patient lists, roll call.

1470
01:53:10,207 --> 01:53:12,542
Right now we're showing
50 people missing. One bus.

1471
01:53:12,709 --> 01:53:15,879
The other buses were heading off to
hospitals. I guess we missed one.

1472
01:53:16,046 --> 01:53:18,173
What's your guess
about where Harvey Dent is?

1473
01:53:18,340 --> 01:53:22,802
Keep looking. And keep it to yourself.
Anybody asks, we got him out.

1474
01:53:25,388 --> 01:53:27,808
Get me the mayor's office on the line.

1475
01:53:28,975 --> 01:53:30,727
We're gonna need the National Guard.

1476
01:53:30,894 --> 01:53:32,521
REPORTER [ON TV]:
- People are still missing...

1477
01:53:32,687 --> 01:53:33,897
...including GCN's own Mike Engel.

1478
01:53:34,064 --> 01:53:37,317
I'm now being told that we're cutting to
a video GCN has just received.

1479
01:53:37,484 --> 01:53:39,402
I'm Mike Engel for Gotham Tonight.

1480
01:53:39,903 --> 01:53:43,240
"What does it take
to make you people wanna join in?

1481
01:53:43,406 --> 01:53:45,992
You failed to kill the lawyer.
I've gotta get you off the bench...

1482
01:53:46,159 --> 01:53:47,911
...and into the game.
JOKER: Bench. Game.

1483
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:52,207
ENGEL: Come nightfall, this city is mine.
JOKER: Mine.

1484
01:53:52,374 --> 01:53:55,126
- And anyone left here plays by my rules.
- Rules.

1485
01:53:55,418 --> 01:53:58,755
Mr. Fox? Security is showing
a break-in at the R & D Department.

1486
01:53:58,922 --> 01:54:01,049
If you don 't wanna be in the game...

1487
01:54:01,216 --> 01:54:02,592
...get out now.
- Get out now.

1488
01:54:04,761 --> 01:54:07,722
But the bridge-and-tunnel crowd
are sure in for a surprise.

1489
01:54:08,098 --> 01:54:09,808
Ha-ha, ha-ha."

1490
01:54:43,466 --> 01:54:44,759
REPORTER: Gotham P.D.
Has shut down...

1491
01:54:44,926 --> 01:54:47,387
BARTENDER: Sweet Jesus.
...the area 's bridges and tunnels.

1492
01:54:47,554 --> 01:54:50,974
Shouldn't you be out there,
you know, doing something?

1493
01:54:51,141 --> 01:54:53,101
It's my day off.

1494
01:54:53,727 --> 01:54:55,312
I gotta take a leak.

1495
01:54:55,479 --> 01:54:57,814
Keep an eye out for me, will you?

1496
01:55:03,403 --> 01:55:05,363
Now what?
Need someone to shake it for you?

1497
01:55:05,530 --> 01:55:07,115
DENT:
Hello.

1498
01:55:07,824 --> 01:55:09,326
Dent.

1499
01:55:09,493 --> 01:55:11,703
Jesus. I thought you was dead.

1500
01:55:11,870 --> 01:55:13,538
Half.

1501
01:55:19,586 --> 01:55:21,171
Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?

1502
01:55:21,338 --> 01:55:23,340
- It must've been Maroni's men.
- Shut up!

1503
01:55:25,091 --> 01:55:27,219
Are you telling me
that you're gonna protect...

1504
01:55:27,385 --> 01:55:29,137
...the other traitor in Gordon's unit?

1505
01:55:29,304 --> 01:55:30,764
I don't know, he never told me.

1506
01:55:30,931 --> 01:55:34,559
Listen, Dent, I swear to God, I didn't
know what they were gonna do to you.

1507
01:55:36,102 --> 01:55:37,270
That's funny...

1508
01:55:39,022 --> 01:55:41,775
...because I don't know
what's gonna happen to you either.

1509
01:55:45,904 --> 01:55:47,823
Beautiful, isn't it?

1510
01:55:48,198 --> 01:55:49,866
Beautiful.

1511
01:55:50,408 --> 01:55:51,535
Unethical.

1512
01:55:52,702 --> 01:55:54,246
Dangerous.

1513
01:55:54,454 --> 01:55:57,958
You've turned every cell phone
in Gotham into a microphone.

1514
01:55:58,124 --> 01:56:00,544
BATMAN:
And a high-frequency generator-receiver.

1515
01:56:00,710 --> 01:56:05,799
You took my sonar concept
and applied it to every phone in the city.

1516
01:56:05,966 --> 01:56:10,554
With half the city feeding you sonar,
you can image all of Gotham.

1517
01:56:12,472 --> 01:56:13,849
This is wrong.

1518
01:56:14,015 --> 01:56:16,059
I've gotta find this man, Lucius.

1519
01:56:18,061 --> 01:56:19,354
At what cost?

1520
01:56:19,521 --> 01:56:22,315
The database is null-key encrypted.

1521
01:56:22,482 --> 01:56:24,693
It can only be accessed by one person.

1522
01:56:26,027 --> 01:56:28,196
This is too much power for one person.

1523
01:56:28,363 --> 01:56:30,532
That's why I gave it to you.

1524
01:56:30,991 --> 01:56:32,200
Only you can use it.

1525
01:56:32,367 --> 01:56:36,163
Spying on 30 million people
isn't part of my job description.

1526
01:56:38,373 --> 01:56:42,085
This is an audio sample. If he talks
within range of any phone in the city...

1527
01:56:42,252 --> 01:56:44,462
...you can triangulate his position.

1528
01:56:44,921 --> 01:56:47,424
I'll help you this one time.

1529
01:56:47,883 --> 01:56:49,676
But consider this my resignation.

1530
01:56:49,843 --> 01:56:54,431
As long as this machine is
at Wayne Enterprises, I won't be.

1531
01:56:55,182 --> 01:56:57,100
When you're finished...

1532
01:56:57,767 --> 01:56:58,894
...type in your name.

1533
01:57:07,486 --> 01:57:10,572
GORDON: My officers are going over
every inch of the tunnels and bridges...

1534
01:57:10,739 --> 01:57:13,950
...but with the Joker's threat,
they're not an option.

1535
01:57:14,117 --> 01:57:16,953
- And land routes east?
- Backed up for hours.

1536
01:57:17,120 --> 01:57:20,749
Which leaves the ferries
with 30,000 ready to board.

1537
01:57:20,916 --> 01:57:23,960
I wanna use the ferries so I can
get those prisoners off the island.

1538
01:57:24,294 --> 01:57:27,088
The men you put away?
Those aren't people I'm worried about.

1539
01:57:27,255 --> 01:57:29,382
You should be.
Whatever the Joker's planning...

1540
01:57:29,549 --> 01:57:34,054
...it's a good bet Harvey's prisoners are
involved. I wanna get them out of here.

1541
01:57:35,514 --> 01:57:36,723
So where is Harvey?

1542
01:57:37,307 --> 01:57:40,477
- We haven't found him.
- Oh, Jesus.

1543
01:57:44,314 --> 01:57:46,399
How long can you keep this quiet?

1544
01:58:00,497 --> 01:58:03,166
Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.

1545
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,169
Going to join your wife?

1546
01:58:09,673 --> 01:58:12,175
- You love her?
- Yes.

1547
01:58:13,051 --> 01:58:16,012
You ever imagine what it would be like
to listen to her die?

1548
01:58:16,179 --> 01:58:17,681
Look, take it up with the Joker.

1549
01:58:17,848 --> 01:58:21,101
He killed your woman. He made you...

1550
01:58:21,268 --> 01:58:22,310
...like this.

1551
01:58:22,686 --> 01:58:25,689
The Joker's just a mad dog.

1552
01:58:25,856 --> 01:58:28,483
I want whoever let him off the leash.

1553
01:58:29,192 --> 01:58:32,529
I took care of Wuertz, but who was
your other man inside Gordon's unit?

1554
01:58:32,696 --> 01:58:35,323
Who picked up Rachel?
Must have been someone she trusted.

1555
01:58:36,533 --> 01:58:38,660
Look, if I tell you...

1556
01:58:38,827 --> 01:58:39,870
...will you let me go?

1557
01:58:40,620 --> 01:58:41,955
Can't hurt your chances.

1558
01:58:44,708 --> 01:58:46,376
It was Ramirez.

1559
01:58:51,798 --> 01:58:55,051
- But you said...
- I said it couldn't hurt your chances.

1560
01:58:58,638 --> 01:59:00,765
You're a lucky man.

1561
01:59:04,227 --> 01:59:05,979
- But he's not.
- Who?

1562
01:59:08,899 --> 01:59:10,317
Your driver.

1563
01:59:23,538 --> 01:59:24,581
GUARDSMAN 1:
Stand back.

1564
01:59:24,748 --> 01:59:27,083
Hey, that ain't right.
We should be on that boat.

1565
01:59:27,250 --> 01:59:29,836
GUARDSMAN 2: You wanna ride across
with them? Be my guest.

1566
01:59:53,068 --> 01:59:54,778
FIRST MATE:
Sir, they've stopped their engines.

1567
01:59:54,945 --> 01:59:55,987
Right, get on the radio.

1568
01:59:56,154 --> 01:59:59,783
Tell them we'll come back and pick
them up once we dump the scumbags.

1569
01:59:59,950 --> 02:00:02,327
Liberty, this is Spirit. Come in.

1570
02:00:04,371 --> 02:00:05,580
CAPTAIN:
What the heck was that?

1571
02:00:07,499 --> 02:00:08,959
MAN:
What the...?

1572
02:00:09,501 --> 02:00:12,796
CAPTAIN [OVER RADIO]: Liberty,
come in, please. This is Spirit. Come in.

1573
02:00:14,422 --> 02:00:16,299
Liberty, we have the same thing.
We've lost both engines.

1574
02:00:16,466 --> 02:00:17,968
- Liberty, come in.
BATMAN: Fox.

1575
02:00:18,134 --> 02:00:20,637
There's something going on
on the ferries.

1576
02:00:21,388 --> 02:00:23,682
Get down to the engine room now.

1577
02:00:24,307 --> 02:00:26,518
MAN:
Hey, buddy, what's happening?

1578
02:00:35,110 --> 02:00:38,572
Captain, we got a hundred barrels
down there rigged to blow. And this.

1579
02:00:51,668 --> 02:00:52,752
CAPTAIN:
Oh, my God.

1580
02:00:52,919 --> 02:00:54,754
FIRST MATE:
Looks like some kind of detonator.

1581
02:00:54,921 --> 02:00:57,799
CAPTAIN: Why would they give us
the detonator to our own bomb?

1582
02:01:00,719 --> 02:01:02,095
JOKER [OVER SPEAKER]:
Tonight, you're all gonna...

1583
02:01:02,262 --> 02:01:04,014
...be a part of a social experiment.

1584
02:01:07,851 --> 02:01:11,688
Through the magic of diesel fuel
and ammonium nitrate...

1585
02:01:11,855 --> 02:01:15,942
...I'm ready right now
to blow you all sky-high.

1586
02:01:16,109 --> 02:01:18,195
Liberty, come in, over.

1587
02:01:19,654 --> 02:01:20,697
It's dead.

1588
02:01:21,031 --> 02:01:25,535
JOKER: If anyone attempts
to get off their boat, you all die.

1589
02:01:25,869 --> 02:01:27,162
FOX:
I'm zeroing in.

1590
02:01:27,329 --> 02:01:31,875
JOKER: Each of you has a remote
to blow up the other boat.

1591
02:01:32,042 --> 02:01:34,503
His voice is on the ferry...

1592
02:01:34,669 --> 02:01:36,713
...but it's not the source.

1593
02:01:38,965 --> 02:01:40,091
West.

1594
02:01:47,349 --> 02:01:49,643
- Gordon.
BATMAN: I have the Joker's location.

1595
02:01:49,810 --> 02:01:50,894
Prewitt Building.

1596
02:01:51,061 --> 02:01:53,522
Assemble on the building opposite.

1597
02:01:54,898 --> 02:01:57,692
At midnight, I blow you all up.

1598
02:01:57,859 --> 02:02:03,031
Lf, however, one of you presses
the button, I'll let that boat live.

1599
02:02:03,198 --> 02:02:05,325
So who 's it gonna be?

1600
02:02:05,492 --> 02:02:08,036
Harvey Dent's most-wanted
scumbag collection...

1601
02:02:08,203 --> 02:02:11,540
...or the sweet and innocent civilians?

1602
02:02:11,706 --> 02:02:14,251
You choose.

1603
02:02:14,417 --> 02:02:16,336
Oh, and you might wanna
decide quickly...

1604
02:02:16,503 --> 02:02:20,841
...because the people on the other boat
may not be quite so noble.

1605
02:02:28,223 --> 02:02:29,266
Stay back.

1606
02:02:29,432 --> 02:02:33,228
Well, now, who are you to decide?
We ought to talk this over, at least.

1607
02:02:33,603 --> 02:02:37,190
We don't all have to die.
Those men had their chance.

1608
02:02:37,816 --> 02:02:41,611
- We are not going to talk about this.
- Why aren't we talking about it?

1609
02:02:41,778 --> 02:02:44,364
They're talking over the same thing
on the other boat.

1610
02:02:44,531 --> 02:02:46,825
- Let's put it to a vote.
CROWD: Yes!

1611
02:02:52,122 --> 02:02:54,708
- Hello?
RAMIREZ: Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez.

1612
02:02:54,875 --> 02:02:57,919
Jim needs you to pack up
and put the kids in the car right away.

1613
02:02:58,086 --> 02:02:59,796
But the units outside...

1614
02:02:59,963 --> 02:03:01,548
Those cops can 't be trusted.

1615
02:03:01,715 --> 02:03:04,676
Jim needs you away from them
as soon as possible.

1616
02:03:04,843 --> 02:03:07,804
I'll call them off for 10 minutes,
and you'll have to move fast.

1617
02:03:07,971 --> 02:03:11,808
- But where am I supposed to take them?
- 25052nd Street.

1618
02:03:11,975 --> 02:03:13,852
Leave as soon as
the patrol car pulls out.

1619
02:03:14,019 --> 02:03:15,395
Okay.

1620
02:03:15,770 --> 02:03:17,564
She believe you?

1621
02:03:17,772 --> 02:03:19,816
It's because she trusts you...

1622
02:03:20,150 --> 02:03:21,234
...just like Rachel did.

1623
02:03:21,401 --> 02:03:23,487
- I didn't know...
- Didn't know what they'd do?

1624
02:03:23,653 --> 02:03:26,406
You're the second cop to say that to me.

1625
02:03:26,656 --> 02:03:28,783
What exactly did you think
they were gonna do?

1626
02:03:28,950 --> 02:03:31,203
They got me early on.
My mother's hospital bills...

1627
02:03:31,369 --> 02:03:34,414
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.

1628
02:03:34,956 --> 02:03:37,417
You live to fight another day, officer.

1629
02:03:41,213 --> 02:03:43,048
SWAT LEADER:
We found the missing hospital bus.

1630
02:03:43,215 --> 02:03:44,925
GORDON:
Then we have a hostage situation.

1631
02:03:47,010 --> 02:03:49,012
It's a shooting gallery.

1632
02:03:49,387 --> 02:03:51,681
Why would he choose a spot
with such big windows?

1633
02:03:51,848 --> 02:03:53,683
SWAT LEADER:
We have clear shots on five clowns.

1634
02:03:53,850 --> 02:03:56,603
Snipers take them out,
smash the windows, a team rappels in.

1635
02:03:57,020 --> 02:03:58,522
Team moves in by the stairwells.

1636
02:03:58,688 --> 02:04:00,816
Two, three casualties max.

1637
02:04:00,982 --> 02:04:02,859
- Let's do it.
BATMAN: It's not that simple.

1638
02:04:03,026 --> 02:04:05,362
- With the Joker, it never is.
- What's simple is...

1639
02:04:05,529 --> 02:04:08,698
...every second, those people on
the ferries get closer to blowing...

1640
02:04:08,865 --> 02:04:11,409
- That won't happen.
- Then he'll blow both of them up!

1641
02:04:11,576 --> 02:04:15,330
- We don't have time for paper ballots.
- I want everybody to put their votes...

1642
02:04:15,497 --> 02:04:17,499
...on this piece of paper.

1643
02:04:18,542 --> 02:04:21,378
If anyone's got pens, pass it along.

1644
02:04:21,711 --> 02:04:23,505
GUARDSMAN: Thank you.
Anybody else?

1645
02:04:23,672 --> 02:04:25,507
Coming through. Anybody else?
Thank you.

1646
02:04:25,674 --> 02:04:28,552
COMMANDER:
We need to get these votes in quickly.

1647
02:04:28,718 --> 02:04:30,262
Come on.

1648
02:04:32,264 --> 02:04:34,391
PRISONER 1: What are you waiting for?
Push the button!

1649
02:04:34,558 --> 02:04:36,518
PRISONER 2:
We're running out of time!

1650
02:04:37,811 --> 02:04:39,646
I need five minutes alone.

1651
02:04:39,813 --> 02:04:41,648
No! There's no time!

1652
02:04:41,815 --> 02:04:43,233
We have clear shots!

1653
02:04:43,400 --> 02:04:46,319
Dent is in there with them.
We have to save Dent!

1654
02:04:46,486 --> 02:04:48,446
I have to save Dent.

1655
02:04:48,613 --> 02:04:49,739
Get ready.

1656
02:04:52,576 --> 02:04:55,245
Two minutes, then we breach.

1657
02:05:00,834 --> 02:05:02,335
Fox, I need picture.

1658
02:05:05,380 --> 02:05:07,841
- Hello?
BARBARA: Jim, we're in trouble.

1659
02:05:09,092 --> 02:05:11,386
FOX:
Okay, you got POV on alpha...

1660
02:05:12,429 --> 02:05:14,389
...omni on beta.

1661
02:05:15,849 --> 02:05:19,227
Looks like clowns and hostages
on two floors.

1662
02:05:19,394 --> 02:05:21,813
There's a SWA T team on the stairwell.

1663
02:05:25,108 --> 02:05:27,736
Another SWA T team on the roof.

1664
02:05:29,279 --> 02:05:30,489
TEAM LEADER:
Line's clear.

1665
02:05:32,240 --> 02:05:34,951
- Barbara, calm down.
- He has the kids!

1666
02:05:35,118 --> 02:05:38,371
DENT: Hello, Jim.
- Harvey?

1667
02:05:39,164 --> 02:05:42,375
- Where's my family?
- Where my family died.

1668
02:05:45,462 --> 02:05:47,130
SWAT LEADER:
Blue team, acquire the target.

1669
02:05:48,798 --> 02:05:51,384
Entry team, set your charge.

1670
02:06:07,317 --> 02:06:09,152
BATMAN: Fox, the SWA Ts are
targeting the wrong people.

1671
02:06:09,319 --> 02:06:10,821
The clowns are the hostages.

1672
02:06:11,530 --> 02:06:13,323
Red team, go! Red team, go!

1673
02:06:17,077 --> 02:06:18,495
Entry team, blow and go!

1674
02:06:22,582 --> 02:06:24,000
Don't move.

1675
02:06:25,168 --> 02:06:26,545
SWAT LEADER:
Take the shot.

1676
02:06:32,175 --> 02:06:33,844
FOX:
Those SWA Ts are coming in hot.

1677
02:06:34,010 --> 02:06:35,846
SWAT 1:
Clowns, put down your guns.

1678
02:06:36,346 --> 02:06:38,974
SWAT 2: Drop your weapons!
SWAT 3: On the ground, now!

1679
02:06:39,182 --> 02:06:42,352
SWAT 4: Doctors, get down!
Clear the line of fire. Drop your weap...

1680
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:08,128
SWAT 5:
Freeze!

1681
02:07:08,295 --> 02:07:10,672
Stand down or you will be...

1682
02:07:14,217 --> 02:07:15,677
FOX:
Look up.

1683
02:07:16,261 --> 02:07:18,847
See those bad guys on the floor above?

1684
02:07:19,014 --> 02:07:22,017
They're waiting to ambush
the SWA T team coming up the elevator.

1685
02:07:22,476 --> 02:07:23,518
SWAT LEADER:
Sixty seconds.

1686
02:07:31,818 --> 02:07:36,406
The tally is 140 against, 396 for.

1687
02:07:44,539 --> 02:07:47,083
So go ahead. Do it.

1688
02:07:47,250 --> 02:07:49,252
We're still here.

1689
02:07:50,420 --> 02:07:53,381
And that means they haven't
killed us yet either.

1690
02:07:54,841 --> 02:07:56,593
TEAM LEADER:
Go, go, go!

1691
02:07:56,760 --> 02:07:58,553
Blue team, cover!

1692
02:08:01,515 --> 02:08:02,557
Uh-oh.

1693
02:08:04,059 --> 02:08:05,727
FOX:
Trouble on the floor above.

1694
02:08:15,070 --> 02:08:16,446
SWAT 6:
Get down on the ground now!

1695
02:08:24,871 --> 02:08:27,290
SWAT 7:
Freeze! Stop or we will shoot.

1696
02:08:27,457 --> 02:08:29,459
SWAT 8:
We will shoot you. Drop the officer.

1697
02:08:29,626 --> 02:08:31,169
Release the officer right now.

1698
02:08:31,336 --> 02:08:33,296
SWAT 9: Let him go now!
On your knees!

1699
02:08:33,880 --> 02:08:35,966
PILOT:
We got him. He's out of the game.

1700
02:08:36,133 --> 02:08:38,635
SWAT 9: Keep your hands in the air!
SWAT 8: Step away from the edge!

1701
02:08:46,685 --> 02:08:48,311
SWAT 10:
Halt!

1702
02:09:01,616 --> 02:09:02,993
SWAT 11: Stay down!
SWAT 12: Don't move!

1703
02:09:03,160 --> 02:09:07,455
SWAT LEADER: Be advised. Clowns
are hostages, doctors are targets.

1704
02:09:13,753 --> 02:09:15,922
Ah, you made it. I'm so thrilled.

1705
02:09:16,089 --> 02:09:19,259
- Where's the detonator?
- Go get him.

1706
02:09:32,647 --> 02:09:35,734
SWAT 13: Put down your weapon!
SWAT 14: Don't move!

1707
02:10:07,140 --> 02:10:09,017
You don't wanna die...

1708
02:10:09,184 --> 02:10:12,229
...but you don't know how to take a life.

1709
02:10:12,395 --> 02:10:14,064
Give it to me.

1710
02:10:14,356 --> 02:10:18,693
These men will kill you
and take it anyway.

1711
02:10:22,113 --> 02:10:24,616
No one wants to get their hands dirty.

1712
02:10:24,783 --> 02:10:27,744
Fine. I'll do it.

1713
02:10:29,412 --> 02:10:32,123
Those men on that boat?
They made their choices.

1714
02:10:32,290 --> 02:10:34,584
They chose to murder and steal.

1715
02:10:34,751 --> 02:10:37,963
It doesn't make any sense
for us to have to die too.

1716
02:10:47,430 --> 02:10:49,891
All the old familiar places.

1717
02:10:56,189 --> 02:10:57,274
FOX:
Stand by.

1718
02:11:07,617 --> 02:11:11,204
SWAT 2: Red team, floor secure.
Hostages are safe.

1719
02:11:11,413 --> 02:11:13,498
Give it to me.

1720
02:11:14,916 --> 02:11:18,670
You can tell them I took it by force.

1721
02:11:19,171 --> 02:11:24,092
Give it to me, and I'll do what
you should've did 10 minutes ago.

1722
02:11:46,156 --> 02:11:49,493
We really should stop this fighting,
otherwise we'll miss the fireworks.

1723
02:11:49,659 --> 02:11:51,495
There won't be any fireworks.

1724
02:11:51,912 --> 02:11:55,123
And here we go.

1725
02:12:34,454 --> 02:12:36,373
What were you trying to prove?

1726
02:12:36,540 --> 02:12:39,501
That deep down,
everyone's as ugly as you?

1727
02:12:40,627 --> 02:12:41,670
You're alone.

1728
02:12:48,260 --> 02:12:53,765
Can't rely on anyone these days. You
gotta do everything yourself. Don't we?

1729
02:12:53,974 --> 02:12:56,810
That's okay. I came prepared.

1730
02:12:57,018 --> 02:13:01,481
It's a funny world we live in. Speaking of
which, you know how I got these scars?

1731
02:13:01,648 --> 02:13:04,484
No, but I know how you got these.

1732
02:13:22,294 --> 02:13:25,046
Oh, you.

1733
02:13:25,213 --> 02:13:28,258
You just couldn't let me go, could you?

1734
02:13:29,384 --> 02:13:33,305
This is what happens
when an unstoppable force...

1735
02:13:33,472 --> 02:13:37,934
...meets an immovable object.

1736
02:13:38,518 --> 02:13:43,940
You truly are incorruptible, aren't you?

1737
02:13:44,107 --> 02:13:46,818
Huh? You won't kill me...

1738
02:13:46,985 --> 02:13:53,241
...out of some misplaced sense
of self-righteousness.

1739
02:13:53,408 --> 02:13:56,620
And I won't kill you...

1740
02:13:56,786 --> 02:14:00,582
...because you're just too much fun.

1741
02:14:01,625 --> 02:14:05,795
I think you and I are destined
to do this forever.

1742
02:14:05,962 --> 02:14:07,964
You'll be in a padded cell forever.

1743
02:14:08,131 --> 02:14:09,966
Maybe we could share one.

1744
02:14:10,133 --> 02:14:11,593
You know,
they'll be doubling up...

1745
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:14,304
...the rate this city's inhabitants
are losing their minds.

1746
02:14:14,471 --> 02:14:17,599
This city just showed you...

1747
02:14:17,766 --> 02:14:21,812
...that it's full of people
ready to believe in good.

1748
02:14:21,978 --> 02:14:25,148
Until their spirit breaks completely.

1749
02:14:26,024 --> 02:14:30,862
Until they get a good look
at the real Harvey Dent...

1750
02:14:31,029 --> 02:14:33,824
...and all the heroic things he's done.

1751
02:14:35,492 --> 02:14:40,539
You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle
for Gotham's soul...

1752
02:14:40,705 --> 02:14:43,625
...in a fistfight with you?

1753
02:14:44,167 --> 02:14:45,710
No.

1754
02:14:45,877 --> 02:14:49,297
You need an ace in the hole.

1755
02:14:49,464 --> 02:14:51,091
Mine's Harvey.

1756
02:14:51,466 --> 02:14:53,176
What did you do?

1757
02:14:53,343 --> 02:14:56,346
I took Gotham's white knight...

1758
02:14:56,513 --> 02:15:00,142
...and I brought him down to our level.

1759
02:15:00,559 --> 02:15:03,520
It wasn't hard.
See, madness, as you know...

1760
02:15:03,687 --> 02:15:06,731
...is like gravity.

1761
02:15:06,898 --> 02:15:09,234
All it takes is a little push.

1762
02:15:26,168 --> 02:15:27,919
Dent!

1763
02:15:48,899 --> 02:15:53,236
DENT: This is where they brought her,
Gordon, after your men handed her over.

1764
02:15:53,987 --> 02:15:55,572
This is where she died.

1765
02:15:55,739 --> 02:15:58,074
I know, I was here...

1766
02:15:59,117 --> 02:16:01,870
...trying to save her.
- But you didn't.

1767
02:16:02,162 --> 02:16:03,914
- I couldn't.
- Yes, you could've.

1768
02:16:04,080 --> 02:16:05,582
If you'd listened to me.

1769
02:16:05,749 --> 02:16:08,376
If you stood up against corruption...

1770
02:16:08,543 --> 02:16:10,754
...instead of doing your deal
with the devil.

1771
02:16:10,921 --> 02:16:12,547
I was trying to fight the Mob!

1772
02:16:13,048 --> 02:16:17,886
You wouldn't dare try to justify yourself
if you knew what I'd lost.

1773
02:16:19,179 --> 02:16:22,307
Have you ever had to talk to the person
you loved most...

1774
02:16:22,474 --> 02:16:26,353
...tell them it's gonna be all right,
when you know it's not?

1775
02:16:28,021 --> 02:16:31,900
Well, you're about to know
what that feels like, Gordon.

1776
02:16:32,651 --> 02:16:36,530
Then you can look me in the eye
and tell me you're sorry.

1777
02:16:38,281 --> 02:16:41,868
- You're not going to hurt my family.
- No.

1778
02:16:42,035 --> 02:16:44,746
Just the person you love most.

1779
02:16:52,754 --> 02:16:55,799
So is it your wife?

1780
02:16:56,883 --> 02:16:58,552
Put the gun down, Harvey.

1781
02:16:58,927 --> 02:17:00,595
Harvey, put down the gun.

1782
02:17:00,762 --> 02:17:04,307
Please. Please, Harvey. Please.

1783
02:17:05,684 --> 02:17:06,977
Oh, goddamn it.

1784
02:17:07,144 --> 02:17:09,312
Will you stop pointing that gun
at my family?

1785
02:17:09,813 --> 02:17:11,481
BARBARA: No!
- We have a winner.

1786
02:17:11,648 --> 02:17:13,150
No, Jim, stop him!

1787
02:17:13,650 --> 02:17:15,485
GORDON: Harvey.
BARBARA: Don't let him...

1788
02:17:15,652 --> 02:17:16,778
Harvey!

1789
02:17:18,155 --> 02:17:20,031
I'm sorry!

1790
02:17:21,825 --> 02:17:22,909
For everything.

1791
02:17:25,495 --> 02:17:27,706
Please don't hurt my son.

1792
02:17:37,841 --> 02:17:39,426
You brought your cops?

1793
02:17:39,593 --> 02:17:42,471
All they know is there's a situation.

1794
02:17:42,637 --> 02:17:45,640
They don't know who or what.
They're just creating a perimeter.

1795
02:17:45,807 --> 02:17:48,477
You think I wanna escape from this?

1796
02:17:48,643 --> 02:17:51,396
There is no escape from this.

1797
02:17:51,563 --> 02:17:53,690
You don't wanna hurt the boy, Harvey.

1798
02:17:55,984 --> 02:17:59,196
It's not about what I want,
it's about what's fair!

1799
02:17:59,946 --> 02:18:04,159
You thought we could be decent men
in an indecent time.

1800
02:18:06,953 --> 02:18:08,038
But you were wrong.

1801
02:18:08,747 --> 02:18:12,542
The world is cruel. And the only morality
in a cruel world...

1802
02:18:13,293 --> 02:18:15,212
...is chance.

1803
02:18:15,378 --> 02:18:17,088
Unbiased.

1804
02:18:17,297 --> 02:18:18,548
Unprejudiced.

1805
02:18:19,925 --> 02:18:21,051
Fair.

1806
02:18:21,218 --> 02:18:23,470
His son's got the same chance she had.

1807
02:18:24,221 --> 02:18:25,514
Fifty-fifty.

1808
02:18:25,680 --> 02:18:29,142
What happened to Rachel wasn't
chance. We decided to act.

1809
02:18:29,476 --> 02:18:30,811
We three.

1810
02:18:30,977 --> 02:18:34,397
Then why was it me who was
the only one who lost everything?

1811
02:18:36,900 --> 02:18:39,528
- It wasn't.
- The Joker chose me.

1812
02:18:39,694 --> 02:18:41,988
Because you were the best of us.

1813
02:18:42,155 --> 02:18:47,160
He wanted to prove that
even someone as good as you...

1814
02:18:47,327 --> 02:18:49,079
...could fall.

1815
02:18:49,412 --> 02:18:50,705
And he was right.

1816
02:18:50,872 --> 02:18:53,124
You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey.

1817
02:18:53,291 --> 02:18:56,336
So point it at the people responsible.

1818
02:18:57,295 --> 02:18:59,131
Fair enough.

1819
02:19:02,467 --> 02:19:04,344
You first.

1820
02:19:16,857 --> 02:19:18,525
My turn.

1821
02:19:25,448 --> 02:19:27,450
Harvey, you're right.

1822
02:19:28,493 --> 02:19:31,121
Rachel's death was my fault.

1823
02:19:34,207 --> 02:19:36,668
Please don't punish the boy.

1824
02:19:37,752 --> 02:19:40,964
- Please, punish me.
- I'm about to.

1825
02:19:42,924 --> 02:19:44,885
Tell your boy
he's gonna be all right, Gordon.

1826
02:19:45,343 --> 02:19:46,970
Lie...

1827
02:19:47,471 --> 02:19:48,597
...like I lied.

1828
02:19:52,350 --> 02:19:53,935
It's going to be all right, son.

1829
02:20:32,349 --> 02:20:35,185
Dad? Daddy, is he okay?

1830
02:20:51,701 --> 02:20:53,870
- Thank you.
- You don't have to thank me.

1831
02:20:54,496 --> 02:20:56,289
Yes, I do.

1832
02:21:00,544 --> 02:21:01,878
The Joker won.

1833
02:21:04,297 --> 02:21:07,175
Harvey's prosecution,
everything he fought for...

1834
02:21:07,717 --> 02:21:09,469
...undone.

1835
02:21:09,970 --> 02:21:14,891
Whatever chance you gave us at fixing
our city dies with Harvey's reputation.

1836
02:21:15,058 --> 02:21:16,226
We bet it all on him.

1837
02:21:17,561 --> 02:21:20,438
The Joker took the best of us
and tore him down.

1838
02:21:21,022 --> 02:21:22,440
People will lose hope.

1839
02:21:22,607 --> 02:21:24,359
They won't.

1840
02:21:26,862 --> 02:21:28,738
They must never know what he did.

1841
02:21:28,905 --> 02:21:30,740
Five dead.

1842
02:21:31,032 --> 02:21:32,325
Two of them cops.

1843
02:21:32,492 --> 02:21:34,953
- You can't sweep that...
- No.

1844
02:21:39,749 --> 02:21:42,586
But the Joker cannot win.

1845
02:21:47,841 --> 02:21:51,052
Gotham needs its true hero.

1846
02:21:57,434 --> 02:22:00,479
- No.
- You either die a hero...

1847
02:22:00,645 --> 02:22:05,108
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

1848
02:22:05,275 --> 02:22:07,110
I can do those things...

1849
02:22:07,527 --> 02:22:10,572
...because I'm not a hero, not like Dent.

1850
02:22:13,575 --> 02:22:16,453
I killed those people.
That's what I can be.

1851
02:22:16,620 --> 02:22:18,538
No, no, you can't. You're not.

1852
02:22:18,705 --> 02:22:21,291
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.

1853
02:22:22,959 --> 02:22:24,085
Call it in.

1854
02:22:27,380 --> 02:22:29,132
GORDON:
A hero.

1855
02:22:29,299 --> 02:22:32,552
Not the hero we deserved,
but the hero we needed.

1856
02:22:33,136 --> 02:22:35,680
Nothing less than a knight...

1857
02:22:36,223 --> 02:22:37,933
...shining.

1858
02:22:38,558 --> 02:22:40,185
GORDON:
They'll hunt you.

1859
02:22:40,352 --> 02:22:42,145
BATMAN:
You'll hunt me.

1860
02:22:42,646 --> 02:22:44,606
You'll condemn me.

1861
02:22:45,315 --> 02:22:47,609
Set the dogs on me.

1862
02:22:51,363 --> 02:22:53,657
Because that's what needs to happen.

1863
02:22:54,825 --> 02:22:56,743
Because sometimes...

1864
02:22:56,910 --> 02:22:59,079
...the truth isn 't good enough.

1865
02:22:59,955 --> 02:23:02,249
Sometimes people deserve more.

1866
02:23:05,710 --> 02:23:09,631
Sometimes people deserve
to have their faith rewarded.

1867
02:23:28,024 --> 02:23:29,693
JAMES:
Batman.

1868
02:23:31,611 --> 02:23:33,363
Batman!

1869
02:23:34,156 --> 02:23:36,116
Why's he running, Dad?

1870
02:23:37,159 --> 02:23:38,493
Because we have to chase him.

1871
02:23:38,660 --> 02:23:41,538
Okay, we're going in! Go, go! Move!

1872
02:23:47,627 --> 02:23:49,212
He didn't do anything wrong.

1873
02:23:51,965 --> 02:23:57,554
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,
but not the one it needs right now.

1874
02:23:58,972 --> 02:24:00,015
So we'll hunt him...

1875
02:24:03,143 --> 02:24:05,228
...because he can take it.

1876
02:24:07,731 --> 02:24:10,233
Because he's not our hero.

1877
02:24:17,782 --> 02:24:18,992
He's a silent guardian...

1878
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:22,037
...a watchful protector.

1879
02:24:24,539 --> 02:24:25,832
A dark knight.
