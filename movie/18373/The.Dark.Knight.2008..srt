1
00:01:45,196 --> 00:01:48,032
GRUMPY: Three of a kind, let's do this.
CHUCKLES: That's it? Three guys?

2
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:51,535
GRUMPY: Two guys on the roof. Every
guy gets a share. Five shares is plenty.

3
00:01:51,702 --> 00:01:54,163
CHUCKLES: Six shares. Don't
forget the guy who planned the job.

4
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,624
GRUMPY: He thinks he can sit it out
and still take a slice.

5
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:59,919
- I know why they call him the Joker.
HAPPY: Why do they call him the Joker?

6
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:01,921
DOPEY: I heard he wears makeup.
HAPPY: Makeup?

7
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,048
DOPEY: Yeah, to scare people.
You know, war paint.

8
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:19,814
GRUMPY: All right, everybody,
hands up, heads down!

9
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:22,984
I said, hands up, heads down!

10
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,112
Let's go, pal,
I'm making a withdrawal here.

11
00:02:26,362 --> 00:02:27,822
- I said, hands up!
- No!

12
00:02:28,197 --> 00:02:30,449
DOPEY:
Here comes the silent alarm.

13
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:31,951
And there it goes.

14
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:33,327
GRUMPY:
Heads down!

15
00:02:33,494 --> 00:02:35,830
All right, tootsie,
you're taking a dive with me.

16
00:02:35,997 --> 00:02:38,666
- Down! I said, stay down there!
WOMAN: Don't hurt me!

17
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,919
DOPEY: Funny, it didn't dial 911.
It was trying to reach a private number.

18
00:02:42,086 --> 00:02:44,005
HAPPY: Is it a problem?
DOPEY: No, I'm done here.

19
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:55,766
GRUMPY:
Sit down! Down!

20
00:02:56,267 --> 00:02:58,436
Down! I said, stay down there!

21
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,526
GRUMPY: Obviously we don't want you
doing anything with your hands...

22
00:03:05,693 --> 00:03:08,613
...other than holding on for dear life.

23
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,372
CHUCKLES:
On the ground! Stay on the ground!

24
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:22,209
Nobody make a move!
Nobody! Stay down!

25
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:44,607
You have any idea
who you're stealing from?

26
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:48,486
- You and your friends are dead.
GRUMPY: He's out, right?

27
00:03:51,572 --> 00:03:52,823
GRUMPY:
What...?

28
00:04:00,665 --> 00:04:02,416
Where did you learn to count?

29
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,255
HAPPY: They wired this thing up
with like 5000 volts.

30
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:08,673
What kind of bank does that?

31
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:11,884
GRUMPY: A Mob bank.
I guess the Joker's as crazy as they say.

32
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,094
Where's the alarm guy?

33
00:04:13,261 --> 00:04:15,763
HAPPY: Boss told me when the guy
was done, I should take him out.

34
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,265
One less share, right?

35
00:04:18,182 --> 00:04:20,434
GRUMPY:
Funny, he told me something similar.

36
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:22,061
HAPPY:
He what? No! No!

37
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:35,157
GRUMPY:
That's a lot of money.

38
00:04:35,324 --> 00:04:39,036
If this Joker guy was so smart,
he'd have had us bring a bigger car.

39
00:04:40,454 --> 00:04:44,375
I'm betting the Joker told you to kill me
soon as we loaded the cash.

40
00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:49,088
BOZO:
No, no, no, I kill the bus driver.

41
00:04:49,797 --> 00:04:50,923
GRUMPY:
Bus driver?

42
00:04:53,134 --> 00:04:54,635
What bus driver?

43
00:04:58,723 --> 00:05:00,641
DRIVER:
School's out. Time to go.

44
00:05:00,808 --> 00:05:03,060
That guy's not getting up, is he?

45
00:05:03,811 --> 00:05:05,479
That's a lot of money.

46
00:05:08,983 --> 00:05:11,319
What happened to the rest of the guys?

47
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:20,453
MANAGER:
You think you're smart, huh?

48
00:05:21,162 --> 00:05:22,788
The guy that hired youse...

49
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:25,917
...he'll just do the same to you.

50
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:29,170
Oh, criminals in this town
used to believe in things.

51
00:05:29,337 --> 00:05:30,630
Honor...

52
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:32,506
...respect.

53
00:05:32,673 --> 00:05:35,009
Look at you.
What do you believe in, huh?

54
00:05:35,176 --> 00:05:36,469
What do you believe in?!

55
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:41,724
I believe whatever doesn't kill you
simply makes you...

56
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:44,852
...stranger.

57
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:29,730
MAN 1: Mr. Mayor, you were elected
in a campaign to clean up the city.

58
00:06:29,897 --> 00:06:32,066
- When are you gonna start?
MAN 2: I already have.

59
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:33,317
MAN 1: Like this Batman.

60
00:06:33,484 --> 00:06:36,070
We're hearing he's doing good,
criminals are running scared.

61
00:06:36,237 --> 00:06:39,949
- No, man. I don't like it tonight.
- What are you, superstitious?

62
00:06:40,116 --> 00:06:43,202
You got more chance of winning
the Powerball than running into him.

63
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:46,747
That's not true. Our men in the
Major Crimes Unit are close to an arrest.

64
00:06:46,914 --> 00:06:49,875
Hey, Wuertz, mayor says
you're closing in on the Batman.

65
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,169
The investigation is ongoing.

66
00:06:52,336 --> 00:06:54,755
MAYOR: The process of cleaning up
the streets is a long one.

67
00:06:54,922 --> 00:06:56,924
I pledged in my campaign, uh, to have...

68
00:07:01,262 --> 00:07:03,556
Ever intending to see your wife again,
lieutenant?

69
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,392
I thought you had to
go look after your mother, detective.

70
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,519
Checked her back into the hospital.

71
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:10,605
I'm sorry.

72
00:07:11,105 --> 00:07:14,400
- So he hasn't shown up?
- He often doesn't.

73
00:07:14,775 --> 00:07:16,485
I like reminding everybody
he's out there.

74
00:07:16,652 --> 00:07:17,945
Why wouldn't he come?

75
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,114
Hopefully...

76
00:07:20,615 --> 00:07:22,158
...because he's busy.

77
00:07:38,883 --> 00:07:41,802
That's why we bring dogs.

78
00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:44,305
- My little princes.
MAN: Please.

79
00:07:44,472 --> 00:07:48,059
Please, they're crawling in my mouth.
Please, I beg you, get them off.

80
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:50,978
CHECHEN: Look what your drugs
do to my customers.

81
00:07:51,145 --> 00:07:52,772
SCARECROW:
Buyer beware.

82
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:56,150
I told you my compound
would take you places.

83
00:07:56,317 --> 00:07:59,070
I never said they'd be places
you wanted to go.

84
00:07:59,237 --> 00:08:01,781
My business, repeat customers.

85
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,658
SCARECROW: You don't like
what I have to offer...

86
00:08:03,824 --> 00:08:05,576
...you can buy from someone else.

87
00:08:05,743 --> 00:08:08,496
Assuming Batman left anyone
to buy from.

88
00:08:11,832 --> 00:08:15,836
My dogs are hungry.

89
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,842
Pity there's only one of you.

90
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,477
CHECHEN: What...?
SCARECROW: That's not him.

91
00:08:35,856 --> 00:08:37,608
Loose the dogs!

92
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,872
SCARECROW:
That's more like it.

93
00:10:19,961 --> 00:10:21,712
Don't let me find you out here again.

94
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:24,715
- We're trying to help you.
BATMAN: I don't need help.

95
00:10:24,882 --> 00:10:26,217
Not my diagnosis.

96
00:10:26,384 --> 00:10:29,971
What gives you the right? What's
the difference between you and me?

97
00:10:30,137 --> 00:10:33,015
I'm not wearing hockey pads.

98
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:38,479
OFFICER:
Everybody back now!

99
00:10:40,648 --> 00:10:43,818
He can't resist showing us his face.

100
00:10:48,072 --> 00:10:50,241
GORDON:
What's he hiding under that makeup?

101
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,626
RAMIREZ: Uh, can we get a minute,
people, please?

102
00:11:03,254 --> 00:11:05,423
Him again. Who are the others?

103
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,174
Another bunch of smalltimers.

104
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:10,261
BATMAN:
Some of the marked bills I gave you.

105
00:11:10,428 --> 00:11:12,722
My detectives have been
making drug buys with them.

106
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:15,474
This bank was another drop for the Mob.
That makes five.

107
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:18,227
- We found the bulk of their dirty cash.
- Time to move in.

108
00:11:18,394 --> 00:11:22,189
We'd have to hit all banks
simultaneously. SWAT teams, backup.

109
00:11:22,523 --> 00:11:24,191
What about this Joker guy?

110
00:11:24,358 --> 00:11:27,320
One man or the entire Mob? He can wait.

111
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,822
When the new DA hears about this,
he'll want in.

112
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,533
- Do you trust him?
- Be hard to keep him out.

113
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,162
I hear he's as stubborn as you are.

114
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,667
ALFRED:
Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt.

115
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,544
You can swap
not sleeping in a penthouse...

116
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,255
...for not sleeping in a mansion.

117
00:12:27,421 --> 00:12:31,175
Whenever you stitch yourself up,
you do make a bloody mess.

118
00:12:31,342 --> 00:12:34,345
Yeah. It makes me learn
from my mistakes.

119
00:12:34,512 --> 00:12:37,932
You ought to be pretty knowledgeable
by now, then.

120
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:40,685
My armor.

121
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:44,438
I'm carrying too much weight.
I need to be... I need to be faster.

122
00:12:44,605 --> 00:12:47,275
I'm sure Mr. Fox can oblige.

123
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:49,944
- Did you get mauled by a tiger?
- It was a dog.

124
00:12:50,111 --> 00:12:52,655
- Huh?
- It was a big dog.

125
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:56,701
There were more copycats last night,
Alfred, with guns.

126
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:58,786
Why not hire them,
take the weekend off?

127
00:12:58,953 --> 00:13:01,789
That wasn't exactly
what I had in mind...

128
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:03,708
...when I said I wanted
to inspire people.

129
00:13:03,874 --> 00:13:05,793
I know.

130
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,461
But things have improved.

131
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,131
Look at the new district attorney.

132
00:13:10,798 --> 00:13:12,800
BRUCE:
I am, closely.

133
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:14,886
Need to know if he can be trusted.

134
00:13:15,052 --> 00:13:19,098
Are you interested in his character
or his social circle?

135
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,313
Who Rachel spends her time with
is her business.

136
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,358
I trust you don't have me followed
on my day off.

137
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:31,611
If you ever took one, I might.

138
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,323
Know your limits, Master Wayne.

139
00:13:35,489 --> 00:13:38,618
Batman has no limits.

140
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:41,829
- Well, you do, sir.
- Well, can't afford to know them.

141
00:13:41,996 --> 00:13:44,498
And what's gonna happen
on the day that you find out?

142
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:47,376
We all know how much you like to say
"I told you so."

143
00:13:47,543 --> 00:13:50,880
On that day, Master Wayne,
even I won't want to.

144
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:52,506
Probably.

145
00:13:59,347 --> 00:14:01,015
MAN:
Sorry I'm late, folks.

146
00:14:04,936 --> 00:14:07,146
- Where were you?
- Worried you'd have to step up?

147
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,316
- Harvey, I know these briefs backwards.
- Well, then...

148
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,485
...fair's fair.

149
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:14,695
Heads, I'll take it. Tails, he's all yours.

150
00:14:14,862 --> 00:14:16,948
Yeah? You wanna
flip a coin to see who leads?

151
00:14:17,114 --> 00:14:20,534
My father's lucky coin. As I recall,
it got me my first date with you.

152
00:14:20,701 --> 00:14:23,871
I wouldn't leave something like that
up to chance.

153
00:14:24,205 --> 00:14:27,291
I don't. I make my own luck.

154
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:32,838
BAILIFF: All rise.
The Honorable Judge Freel presiding.

155
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,675
I thought the DA just
played golf with the mayor.

156
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:39,554
Teeoff's 1:30. More than enough time
to put you away for life, Sally.

157
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,264
With Carmine Falcone in Arkham...

158
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,433
...someone must have stepped up
to run the so-called family.

159
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:47,562
Is that man in this courtroom today?

160
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:52,733
- Could you identify him for us, please?
- You win, counselor.

161
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:56,571
It was me.

162
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:02,076
I have a sworn statement from you
that this man...

163
00:15:02,243 --> 00:15:05,955
...Salvatore Maroni, is the new head
of the Falcone crime family.

164
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:10,251
Maroni? He's a fall guy.
I'm the brains of the organization.

165
00:15:11,627 --> 00:15:13,170
JUDGE: Order.
- Permission to treat...

166
00:15:13,337 --> 00:15:14,589
...the witness as hostile?
- Granted.

167
00:15:14,755 --> 00:15:15,798
- Hostile? I'll show you hostile!

168
00:15:22,013 --> 00:15:24,765
Carbon fiber, .28 caliber,
made in China.

169
00:15:24,932 --> 00:15:26,475
If you wanna kill a
public servant, Mr. Maroni...

170
00:15:26,642 --> 00:15:28,853
...I recommend you buy American.

171
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,398
JUDGE: Get him out of here.
- But, Your Honor, I'm not done.

172
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,405
We'll never be able to link the gun
to Maroni, so we can't charge him.

173
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:42,366
But they're trying to kill you,
means we're getting to them.

174
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:45,661
I'm glad you're so pleased, Rachel.
I'm fine, by the way.

175
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:47,538
Come on, Harvey. You're Gotham's DA.

176
00:15:47,705 --> 00:15:50,541
You're not getting shot at,
you're not doing your job right.

177
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:51,918
But, you know...

178
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:55,421
...if you said you were rattled,
we could take the rest of the day off.

179
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:58,507
Can't. I dragged the head of
the Major Crimes Unit down here.

180
00:15:58,674 --> 00:16:03,429
Oh, Jim Gordon? He's a friend, actually.
Try to be nice.

181
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,274
I hear you got a hell of a right cross.

182
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:20,696
It's a shame Sal's going to walk.

183
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:24,909
Yeah, well, good thing about the Mob
is they keep giving you second chances.

184
00:16:30,081 --> 00:16:32,416
Lightly irradiated bills.

185
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,169
Fancy stuff for a city cop. Have help?

186
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:37,338
We liaise with various agencies...

187
00:16:37,505 --> 00:16:39,257
Save it, Gordon. I wanna meet him.

188
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:43,010
Official policy is to arrest the vigilante
known as Batman on sight.

189
00:16:43,177 --> 00:16:45,346
Mm-hm. What about that floodlight
on the top of MCU?

190
00:16:45,513 --> 00:16:47,932
If you got problems
with malfunctioning equipment...

191
00:16:48,099 --> 00:16:51,310
...I suggest you take them up
with Maintenance, counselor.

192
00:16:51,602 --> 00:16:54,146
I've put every money launderer
in Gotham behind bars...

193
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,691
...but the Mob
is still getting its money out.

194
00:16:56,857 --> 00:17:00,319
I think you and your friend
have found the last game in town.

195
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:03,197
You're trying to hit them
where it hurts, their wallets.

196
00:17:03,364 --> 00:17:04,532
It's bold.

197
00:17:05,575 --> 00:17:06,617
You gonna count me in?

198
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:10,538
In this town, the fewer people know
something, the safer the operation.

199
00:17:10,705 --> 00:17:12,957
I don't like that you got
your own special unit...

200
00:17:13,124 --> 00:17:16,043
...and it's full of cops
I investigated at Internal Affairs.

201
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,046
If I didn't work with cops
you'd investigated while at IA...

202
00:17:19,213 --> 00:17:20,464
...I'd be working alone.

203
00:17:21,215 --> 00:17:23,134
I don't get political points
for being an idealist.

204
00:17:23,301 --> 00:17:25,720
I do the best I can with what I have.

205
00:17:29,307 --> 00:17:33,060
You want me to back warrants
for search and seizure on five banks...

206
00:17:33,227 --> 00:17:35,062
...without telling me what we're after.

207
00:17:36,147 --> 00:17:38,733
I can give you the names of the banks.

208
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,818
Well, that's a start.

209
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,529
I'll get you your warrants,
but I want your trust.

210
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,364
Oh, you don't have
to sell me, Dent.

211
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,533
We all know you're Gotham's
white knight.

212
00:17:48,784 --> 00:17:52,246
Yeah, well, I heard they have
a different name for me down at MCU.

213
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,123
I wouldn't know about that.

214
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:59,086
MAN: In China, Lau Security Investments
stands for dynamic new growth.

215
00:17:59,253 --> 00:18:03,549
A joint Chinese venture with
Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.

216
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:05,635
FOX:
Well, Mr. Lau...

217
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,763
...I speak for the rest of the board...

218
00:18:09,347 --> 00:18:12,266
...and Mr. Wayne,
in expressing our own excitement.

219
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:20,775
Sir, I know Mr. Wayne is curious about
how his trust fund gets replenished...

220
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:23,444
...but, frankly, this is embarrassing.

221
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:26,197
You worry about the diligence,
Mr. Reese.

222
00:18:26,364 --> 00:18:28,658
I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.

223
00:18:28,824 --> 00:18:30,368
It's done.

224
00:18:30,534 --> 00:18:32,286
The numbers are solid.

225
00:18:32,453 --> 00:18:33,996
Do them again.

226
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:37,250
Wouldn't want the trust fund to run out,
now, would we?

227
00:18:39,961 --> 00:18:41,587
FOX:
Another long night?

228
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:44,715
This joint venture was your idea,
and the consultants love it.

229
00:18:45,383 --> 00:18:46,634
But I'm not convinced.

230
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:50,471
Lau's company has grown by
8 percent annually like clockwork.

231
00:18:50,638 --> 00:18:53,057
His revenue stream
must be off the books...

232
00:18:53,224 --> 00:18:54,642
...maybe even illegal.

233
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:56,477
Okay. Cancel the deal.

234
00:18:57,812 --> 00:18:58,980
You already knew.

235
00:18:59,689 --> 00:19:02,233
Just needed a closer look at their books.

236
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,443
Anything else you can trouble me for?

237
00:19:04,902 --> 00:19:06,445
I need a new suit.

238
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,115
Yeah. Three buttons
is a little '90s, Mr. Wayne.

239
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:12,410
I'm not talking fashion, Mr. Fox,
so much as function.

240
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,162
You wanna be able to turn your head.

241
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:17,415
Sure make backing out
of the driveway easier.

242
00:19:17,873 --> 00:19:19,417
I'll see what I can do.

243
00:19:24,171 --> 00:19:26,132
Took three weeks
to get a reservation here.

244
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,426
I had to tell them
I work for the government.

245
00:19:28,593 --> 00:19:29,844
- Really?
- Health inspector's...

246
00:19:30,011 --> 00:19:31,262
...not afraid to pull strings.

247
00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:33,639
Rachel. Fancy that.

248
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:36,309
Yeah, Bruce. Fancy that.

249
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,811
Rachel, Natascha. Natascha, Rachel.

250
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:44,358
- Natascha. Are you the prima...?
- Prima ballerina for the Moscow Ballet.

251
00:19:44,525 --> 00:19:47,862
- Wow. Harvey's taking me next week.
- Really? So you're into ballet?

252
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:50,364
Bruce. This is Harvey Dent.

253
00:19:50,698 --> 00:19:54,452
The famous Bruce Wayne.
Rachel's told me everything about you.

254
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:55,828
I certainly hope not.

255
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:59,498
- Let's put a couple tables together.
- I'm not sure that they'll let us.

256
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,710
Oh, they should. I own the place.

257
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:06,130
How could you want to raise children
in a city like this?

258
00:20:06,297 --> 00:20:08,257
Well, I was raised here.
I turned out okay.

259
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:10,009
Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?

260
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:11,677
Is...? Heh-heh.

261
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:13,387
The Palisades? Sure.

262
00:20:13,554 --> 00:20:16,015
You know, as our new DA,
you might wanna figure out...

263
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:18,017
...where your jurisdiction ends.

264
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:22,146
I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante.

265
00:20:22,313 --> 00:20:25,691
Gotham City is proud of an ordinary
citizen standing up for what's right.

266
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:28,110
Gotham needs heroes like you,
elected officials...

267
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:30,238
...not a man who thinks
he's above the law.

268
00:20:30,404 --> 00:20:31,572
Who appointed the Batman?

269
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:35,576
We did. All of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city.

270
00:20:35,743 --> 00:20:37,495
NATASCHA:
But this is a democracy, Harvey.

271
00:20:37,662 --> 00:20:39,413
DENT:
When their enemies were at the gates...

272
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:43,292
...the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city.

273
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:46,045
It wasn't considered an honor,
it was a public service.

274
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:47,880
Harvey, the last man
that they appointed...

275
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:50,341
...to protect the republic
was named Caesar...

276
00:20:50,508 --> 00:20:53,928
...and he never gave up his power.
- Okay, fine.

277
00:20:54,095 --> 00:20:55,429
You either die a hero...

278
00:20:55,596 --> 00:20:58,641
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

279
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:02,311
Whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
wanna do this for the rest of his life.

280
00:21:02,478 --> 00:21:05,731
How could he? Batman is looking for
someone to take up his mantle.

281
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:08,192
NATASCHA:
Someone like you, Mr. Dent?

282
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:11,112
Maybe. If I'm up to it.

283
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:16,534
What if Harvey Dent
is the Caped Crusader? Hm?

284
00:21:18,786 --> 00:21:21,956
If I were sneaking out every night,
someone would've noticed by now.

285
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:28,462
Well, I'm sold, Dent,
and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.

286
00:21:28,629 --> 00:21:31,465
That's nice, but I'm not
up for reelection for three years.

287
00:21:31,632 --> 00:21:33,551
No, you don't understand.

288
00:21:33,718 --> 00:21:36,512
One fundraiser with my pals...

289
00:21:37,138 --> 00:21:39,265
...you'll never need another cent.

290
00:21:53,988 --> 00:21:56,115
What the hell is this?

291
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,578
As you're all aware,
one of our deposits was stolen.

292
00:22:00,745 --> 00:22:04,123
A relatively small amount, 68 million.

293
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,834
Who's stupid enough to steal from us?

294
00:22:07,168 --> 00:22:10,713
Two-bit wackjob,
wears a cheap purple suit and makeup.

295
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,840
He's not the problem. He's a nobody.

296
00:22:13,007 --> 00:22:16,385
The problem is our money
being tracked by the cops.

297
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:19,055
Thanks to Mr. Maroni's
well-placed sources...

298
00:22:19,222 --> 00:22:23,017
...we know that police have indeed
identified our banks using marked bills...

299
00:22:23,184 --> 00:22:25,686
...and are planning to
seize your funds today.

300
00:22:25,853 --> 00:22:29,857
And since the enthusiastic new D A has
put all my competitors out of business...

301
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:33,986
...I'm your only option.
MARONl: So, what are you proposing?

302
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:37,823
LAU: Moving all deposits to
one secure location, not a bank.

303
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,951
- Where, then?
- No one can know but me.

304
00:22:40,701 --> 00:22:43,454
If the police were to gain leverage
over one of you...

305
00:22:43,621 --> 00:22:45,414
...everyone's money would be at stake.

306
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:47,708
What stop them getting to you?

307
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,962
I go to Hong Kong,
far from Dent's jurisdiction...

308
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:54,215
...and the Chinese will not extradite
one of their own.

309
00:22:54,382 --> 00:22:56,008
MARONl:
How soon can you move the money?

310
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,385
LAU:
I already have.

311
00:22:59,762 --> 00:23:02,390
For obvious reasons, I couldn't wait
for your permission.

312
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:06,686
Rest assured, your money is safe.

313
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:21,284
And I thought my jokes were bad.

314
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:24,537
Give me one reason why I shouldn't
have my boy pull your head off.

315
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:25,997
How about a magic trick?

316
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:31,669
I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.

317
00:23:35,256 --> 00:23:36,757
It's...

318
00:23:36,924 --> 00:23:39,218
It's gone.

319
00:23:39,594 --> 00:23:41,929
Oh, and by the way,
the suit, it wasn't cheap.

320
00:23:42,096 --> 00:23:44,932
- You ought to know, you bought it.
CHECHEN: Sit.

321
00:23:46,017 --> 00:23:49,061
I want to hear proposition.

322
00:23:51,772 --> 00:23:54,275
JOKER:
Let's wind the clocks back a year.

323
00:23:54,609 --> 00:24:00,281
These cops and lawyers
wouldn't dare cross any of you.

324
00:24:01,449 --> 00:24:03,576
I mean, what happened?

325
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:07,538
Did your balls drop off? Hm?

326
00:24:07,705 --> 00:24:09,749
You see, a guy like me...

327
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,960
- A freak.
MOBSTER 1: Damn right.

328
00:24:13,127 --> 00:24:16,255
A guy like me... Look, listen.

329
00:24:16,797 --> 00:24:21,093
I know why you choose
to have your little, ahem...

330
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,971
...group-therapy sessions
in broad daylight.

331
00:24:24,472 --> 00:24:27,266
I know why you're afraid
to go out at night.

332
00:24:29,477 --> 00:24:31,145
The Batman.

333
00:24:31,312 --> 00:24:36,567
See, Batman has shown Gotham
your true colors, unfortunately.

334
00:24:36,734 --> 00:24:40,238
Dent, he's just the beginning.

335
00:24:40,821 --> 00:24:45,576
And as for the television's
so-called plan...

336
00:24:46,035 --> 00:24:47,912
...Batman has no jurisdiction.

337
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:50,665
He'll find him and make him squeal.

338
00:24:50,831 --> 00:24:53,834
I know the squealers when I see them...

339
00:24:54,001 --> 00:24:55,670
...and...

340
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,922
CHECHEN:
What do you propose?

341
00:24:58,089 --> 00:25:00,508
It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman.

342
00:25:01,842 --> 00:25:04,804
If it's so simple, why haven't
you done it already?

343
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:07,682
If you're good at something,
never do it for free.

344
00:25:08,349 --> 00:25:09,642
How much you want?

345
00:25:10,351 --> 00:25:12,353
Uh, half.

346
00:25:14,564 --> 00:25:17,316
GAMBOL: You're crazy.
- No, I'm not.

347
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:19,610
No, I'm not.

348
00:25:21,195 --> 00:25:24,615
If we don't deal with this now...

349
00:25:24,782 --> 00:25:26,409
...soon...

350
00:25:26,617 --> 00:25:31,539
...little Gambol here won't be able
to get a nickel for his grandma.

351
00:25:32,206 --> 00:25:33,666
Enough from the clown!

352
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:36,794
Ah, ta-ta-ta. Let's not blow...

353
00:25:36,961 --> 00:25:39,505
MOBSTER 2: Shit!
...this out of proportion.

354
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:42,174
You think you can steal from us
and just walk away?

355
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:43,885
- Yeah.
GAMBOL: I'm putting the word out.

356
00:25:44,051 --> 00:25:46,345
Five hundred grand for this clown dead.

357
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:49,557
A million alive, so I can teach him
some manners first.

358
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,436
All right. So, listen,
why don't you give me a call...

359
00:25:53,603 --> 00:25:57,356
...when you wanna start taking things
a little more seriously?

360
00:25:57,523 --> 00:25:59,400
Here's my card.

361
00:26:19,503 --> 00:26:21,881
You're a hard man to reach.

362
00:26:24,884 --> 00:26:27,178
Lau's halfway to Hong Kong.

363
00:26:28,471 --> 00:26:31,307
If you'd have asked,
I could have taken his passport.

364
00:26:31,474 --> 00:26:34,143
All that was left in the vaults
were marked bills.

365
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:37,605
They knew we were coming.
As soon as your office got involved...

366
00:26:37,772 --> 00:26:38,814
My office?

367
00:26:38,981 --> 00:26:42,652
You're sitting down there with scum like
Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking...

368
00:26:42,818 --> 00:26:45,947
Oh, yeah. I almost had your rookie
cold on a racketeering beat.

369
00:26:46,113 --> 00:26:50,660
Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly
Maroni's got people in your office, Dent.

370
00:26:53,454 --> 00:26:55,414
We need Lau back...

371
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:59,544
...but the Chinese won't extradite
a national under any circumstances.

372
00:26:59,877 --> 00:27:02,588
If I get him to you,
can you get him to talk?

373
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:03,965
I'll get him to sing.

374
00:27:04,131 --> 00:27:06,884
We're going after the Mob's life savings.

375
00:27:07,051 --> 00:27:08,302
Things will get ugly.

376
00:27:08,469 --> 00:27:10,763
I knew the risk when I took this job,
lieutenant.

377
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,473
How will you get him back, any...?

378
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:16,477
He does that.

379
00:27:16,644 --> 00:27:20,147
Our Chinese friends left town
before I could tell them the deal was off.

380
00:27:20,314 --> 00:27:23,818
Well, I'm sure that you've always
wanted to go to Hong Kong.

381
00:27:23,985 --> 00:27:26,153
What's wrong with a phone call?

382
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,949
I think Mr. Lau deserves
a more personal touch.

383
00:27:31,158 --> 00:27:32,994
FOX: Now, for high-altitude jumps...

384
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,955
...you're going to need oxygen
and stabilizers.

385
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:39,750
Well, I must say,
compared to your usual requests...

386
00:27:39,917 --> 00:27:42,503
...jumping out of an airplane
is pretty straightforward.

387
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:45,256
BRUCE:
What about getting back into the plane?

388
00:27:45,423 --> 00:27:49,260
- I'd recommend a good travel agent.
- Without it landing.

389
00:27:50,428 --> 00:27:53,180
Now, that's more like it, Mr. Wayne.

390
00:27:53,723 --> 00:27:56,350
The CIA had a program
back in the '60s...

391
00:27:56,517 --> 00:27:59,854
...for getting their people out
of hot spots called Sky Hook.

392
00:28:00,021 --> 00:28:02,690
- We could look into that.
- Yeah.

393
00:28:02,857 --> 00:28:04,525
Okay. Now...

394
00:28:06,027 --> 00:28:08,738
Hardened Kevlar plates
over titanium-dipped...

395
00:28:08,905 --> 00:28:11,032
...tri-weave fibers for flexibility.

396
00:28:11,198 --> 00:28:14,035
You'll be lighter, faster, more agile.

397
00:28:17,538 --> 00:28:19,707
Perhaps you should
read the instructions first?

398
00:28:19,874 --> 00:28:21,876
- Yeah.
- Now, there is a tradeoff.

399
00:28:22,043 --> 00:28:25,546
Separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.

400
00:28:25,713 --> 00:28:28,674
We wouldn't wanna make things
too easy, now, would we?

401
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:30,885
How will it hold up against dogs?

402
00:28:31,052 --> 00:28:33,179
We talking rottweilers or Chihuahuas?

403
00:28:34,388 --> 00:28:36,891
Should do fine against cats.

404
00:28:37,058 --> 00:28:39,185
I found one in Arizona.

405
00:28:39,352 --> 00:28:42,271
A very nice man said he could have it
up and running in a week...

406
00:28:42,438 --> 00:28:43,522
...and he takes cash.

407
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:46,525
- What about the flight crew?
- South Korean smugglers.

408
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:48,903
They run flights into Pyongyang,
below radar.

409
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,822
- Did you think of an alibi?
- Oh, yes.

410
00:28:54,116 --> 00:28:56,535
PERFORMANCE CANCELLED

411
00:29:00,706 --> 00:29:04,877
Love Boat: Billionaire Absconds
With Entire Russian Ballet

412
00:29:10,591 --> 00:29:13,219
I believe this is your plane, sir.

413
00:29:17,431 --> 00:29:20,935
You look tired, Alfred.
You'll be all right without me?

414
00:29:22,603 --> 00:29:26,107
If you can tell me the Russian for
"apply your own bloody suntan lotion."

415
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:41,080
Yo, Gambol, somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the Joker.

416
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:43,082
BOD YGUARD:
They brought the body.

417
00:29:59,473 --> 00:30:01,976
So, dead, that's 500.

418
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:05,730
How about alive? Hm?

419
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:12,111
You wanna know how I got these scars?

420
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:17,033
My father was...

421
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:18,659
...a drinker...

422
00:30:18,826 --> 00:30:20,077
...and a fiend.

423
00:30:20,912 --> 00:30:25,082
And one night,
he goes off crazier than usual.

424
00:30:25,499 --> 00:30:28,294
Mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself.

425
00:30:28,461 --> 00:30:30,004
He doesn't like that...

426
00:30:30,171 --> 00:30:33,633
...not one bit.

427
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:36,344
So, me watching...

428
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:41,098
...he takes the knife to her,
laughing while he does it.

429
00:30:41,265 --> 00:30:44,352
He turns to me and he says:

430
00:30:44,518 --> 00:30:48,189
"Why so serious?"

431
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:50,024
He comes at me with the knife.

432
00:30:50,691 --> 00:30:52,610
"Why so serious?"

433
00:30:54,862 --> 00:30:57,740
He sticks the blade in my mouth.

434
00:30:58,074 --> 00:31:01,994
"Let's put a smile on that face."

435
00:31:03,204 --> 00:31:05,414
And...

436
00:31:07,792 --> 00:31:09,335
Why so serious?

437
00:31:14,382 --> 00:31:15,883
Now...

438
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:18,302
...our operation is small...

439
00:31:18,469 --> 00:31:21,389
...but there is a lot of potential...

440
00:31:21,556 --> 00:31:24,100
...for aggressive expansion.

441
00:31:24,267 --> 00:31:27,478
So which of you fine gentlemen
would like to join our team?

442
00:31:27,645 --> 00:31:32,066
Oh. There's only one spot open
right now, so we're gonna have...

443
00:31:32,733 --> 00:31:34,902
...tryouts.

444
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:41,492
Make it fast.

445
00:31:50,918 --> 00:31:52,336
MAN:
Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox.

446
00:31:52,503 --> 00:31:55,214
Mr. Lau regrets he is unable
to greet you in person today.

447
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:57,300
FOX:
I understand.

448
00:32:07,101 --> 00:32:10,688
For security purposes, I'm gonna have to
ask you to check in your mobile.

449
00:32:10,855 --> 00:32:12,440
Of course.

450
00:32:15,192 --> 00:32:18,905
I must apologize for leaving Gotham
in the middle of our negotiations.

451
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:22,617
This misunderstanding
with the Gotham police force...

452
00:32:22,783 --> 00:32:25,328
...I couldn't let it threaten my company.
- Of course.

453
00:32:25,494 --> 00:32:28,664
A businessman of your stature
will understand and...

454
00:32:28,831 --> 00:32:32,793
...with you here now, we can continue.

455
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,714
Well, I do appreciate you bringing me
out here in such style, Mr. Lau, but I re...

456
00:32:38,257 --> 00:32:40,092
We do not allow cell phones in here.

457
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:42,970
I'm sorry. Forgot I had it.

458
00:32:43,137 --> 00:32:47,767
No, I really came to tell you that
our business deal has to be put on hold.

459
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:51,395
You see, we can't afford
to be seen to do business with...

460
00:32:52,521 --> 00:32:54,482
...whatever it is you're accused of being.

461
00:32:54,649 --> 00:32:57,235
I'm sure a businessman of your stature
will understand.

462
00:32:57,401 --> 00:33:01,322
I think, Mr. Fox, a simple phone call
might have sufficed.

463
00:33:01,489 --> 00:33:04,867
Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think
he was deliberately wasting your time.

464
00:33:05,034 --> 00:33:06,661
Just accidentally wasting it.

465
00:33:07,662 --> 00:33:11,832
That's very good, Mr. Lau.
"Accidentally." Very good.

466
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:13,960
Hey, sir.

467
00:33:32,186 --> 00:33:34,188
There's a better view
from the peak tram.

468
00:33:34,355 --> 00:33:36,190
How's the view from LSI Holdings?

469
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:38,025
Restricted.

470
00:33:38,192 --> 00:33:40,194
Lau is holed up in there good and tight.

471
00:33:40,361 --> 00:33:42,280
- What's this?
- I had R & D work it up.

472
00:33:42,446 --> 00:33:44,115
Sends out a high-frequency pulse...

473
00:33:44,282 --> 00:33:47,118
...records the response time
for mapping an environment.

474
00:33:47,618 --> 00:33:50,204
Sonar. Just like a...

475
00:33:50,371 --> 00:33:52,540
Submarine, Mr. Wayne.
Like a submarine.

476
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,876
- And the other device?
- It's in place.

477
00:33:55,793 --> 00:33:56,836
Mr. Wayne?

478
00:33:58,045 --> 00:33:59,338
Good luck.

479
00:37:42,603 --> 00:37:45,439
Please Deliver To
LIEUTENANT GORDON

480
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:52,488
RACHEL: Look, give us the money
and we'll talk about making a deal.

481
00:37:52,655 --> 00:37:55,950
The money is the only reason
I'm still alive.

482
00:37:56,117 --> 00:38:00,246
Oh, you mean, when they find out that
you've helped us, they're gonna kill you?

483
00:38:00,413 --> 00:38:02,123
- Are you threatening my client?
- No.

484
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:06,502
I'm just assuming your client's
cooperation with this investigation.

485
00:38:08,129 --> 00:38:09,797
As will everyone.

486
00:38:11,132 --> 00:38:14,468
No? Okay.

487
00:38:14,927 --> 00:38:17,930
Enjoy your time in County, Mr. Lau.

488
00:38:18,097 --> 00:38:19,599
LAU:
Wait!

489
00:38:19,807 --> 00:38:21,809
I won't give you the money...

490
00:38:21,976 --> 00:38:24,979
...but I will give you my clients,
all of them.

491
00:38:25,271 --> 00:38:27,481
You were a glorified accountant.

492
00:38:27,648 --> 00:38:31,485
What could you possibly have
on all of them that we could charge?

493
00:38:31,652 --> 00:38:35,489
I'm good with calculation.
I handled all their investments.

494
00:38:35,656 --> 00:38:37,241
One big pot.

495
00:38:38,618 --> 00:38:39,952
Got it.

496
00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:42,205
One minute.

497
00:38:42,997 --> 00:38:45,708
RICO. If they pooled their money...

498
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:47,668
...we can charge them
as one criminal conspiracy.

499
00:38:47,835 --> 00:38:49,003
Charge them with what?

500
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:52,048
In a RICO case, if you can charge
one of conspiracy with a felony...

501
00:38:52,215 --> 00:38:54,800
You can charge all of  with it.
That's great.

502
00:38:56,177 --> 00:38:58,095
Mr. Lau.

503
00:38:59,096 --> 00:39:03,100
What kind of details do you have
about this communal fund?

504
00:39:03,267 --> 00:39:04,894
- Ledgers...?
- Immunity, protection...

505
00:39:05,061 --> 00:39:08,522
...a chartered plane back to Hong Kong.
- After you testify in open court.

506
00:39:08,689 --> 00:39:11,025
I'm just curious.
With all your clients locked up...

507
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,569
...what's gonna happen
with all that money?

508
00:39:13,736 --> 00:39:16,864
Like I said, I'm good with calculation.

509
00:39:17,031 --> 00:39:21,702
He can't go to County.
I'll keep him here in the holding cells.

510
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:24,413
What is this, Gordon, your fortress?

511
00:39:24,705 --> 00:39:27,375
Well, you trust them over at County?

512
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:29,377
I don't trust them here.

513
00:39:31,128 --> 00:39:32,630
Lau stays.

514
00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:35,675
Well, I don 't know about
Mr. Lau's travel arrangements...

515
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:37,635
...but I'm sure glad he's back.

516
00:39:37,802 --> 00:39:40,263
Put word out. We hire the clown.

517
00:39:43,057 --> 00:39:46,894
He was right.
We have to fix real problem.

518
00:39:47,395 --> 00:39:48,521
Batman.

519
00:39:53,067 --> 00:39:56,988
- I'm not aware of any participation...
- Our boy looks good on the tube.

520
00:39:57,488 --> 00:40:00,241
You sure you wanna embarrass me
in front of my friends?

521
00:40:00,408 --> 00:40:04,078
Oh, don't worry. They're coming too.

522
00:40:10,918 --> 00:40:12,753
STEPHENS:
Have a nice trip. See you next fall.

523
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,755
WOMAN: Seven hundred
twelve counts of extortion.

524
00:40:14,922 --> 00:40:17,341
Eight hundred and forty-nine
counts of racketeering.

525
00:40:17,508 --> 00:40:20,052
Two hundred and forty-six
counts of fraud.

526
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:23,055
Eighty-seven counts
of conspiracy murder.

527
00:40:23,973 --> 00:40:27,101
Five hundred and twenty-seven
counts of obstruction of justice.

528
00:40:27,518 --> 00:40:28,895
How do the defendants plead?

529
00:40:36,068 --> 00:40:37,111
Order in the court.

530
00:40:37,278 --> 00:40:39,780
MAYOR: Five hundred and forty-nine
criminals at once.

531
00:40:39,947 --> 00:40:42,450
How did you convince Surrillo
to hear this farce?

532
00:40:42,617 --> 00:40:46,746
She shares my enthusiasm for justice.
After all, she is a judge.

533
00:40:46,913 --> 00:40:49,957
Even if you blow enough smoke
to get convictions out of Surrillo...

534
00:40:50,124 --> 00:40:52,710
...you're gonna set
a new record at appeals.

535
00:40:52,877 --> 00:40:55,379
It won't matter.
The head guys make bail, sure.

536
00:40:55,546 --> 00:40:57,965
But the midlevel guys, they can't.

537
00:40:58,132 --> 00:40:59,967
They can't afford to be off the streets.

538
00:41:00,134 --> 00:41:02,261
They'll cut deals that
include some jail time.

539
00:41:02,428 --> 00:41:05,431
Think of all you could do
with 18 months of clean streets.

540
00:41:06,974 --> 00:41:10,102
LOEB: Mr. Mayor, you can't...
- No, get out. Both of you.

541
00:41:14,273 --> 00:41:15,816
Sit down.

542
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,783
The public likes you. That's the
only reason that this might fly.

543
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,284
But that means it's on you.

544
00:41:25,451 --> 00:41:28,496
They're all gonna come after you now,
and not just the Mob.

545
00:41:28,663 --> 00:41:32,500
Politicians, journalists, cops.

546
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:35,169
Anyone whose wallet's
about to get lighter.

547
00:41:35,336 --> 00:41:38,005
Are you up to it? You'd better be.

548
00:41:38,172 --> 00:41:40,299
Because they get anything on you...

549
00:41:40,466 --> 00:41:45,263
...and those criminals are back on the
streets, followed swiftly by you and me.

550
00:41:45,429 --> 00:41:46,722
Jesus!

551
00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:10,329
ALFRED: I think your fundraiser
will be a great success, sir.

552
00:42:10,496 --> 00:42:13,165
BRUCE: And why do you think I wanna
hold a party for Harvey Dent?

553
00:42:13,332 --> 00:42:16,419
I assumed it was your usual reason
for socializing beyond myself...

554
00:42:16,586 --> 00:42:18,629
...and the scum of Gotham's underbelly:

555
00:42:18,796 --> 00:42:20,590
To try to impress Miss Dawes.

556
00:42:20,756 --> 00:42:24,844
Very droll, but very wrong.
Actually, it's Dent.

557
00:42:25,011 --> 00:42:27,889
ENGEL [ON TV]: Police released video
footage found concealed on the body.

558
00:42:28,055 --> 00:42:30,683
Sensitive viewers, be aware.
The image is disturbing.

559
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:33,060
JOKER:
Tell them your name.

560
00:42:33,227 --> 00:42:34,896
Brian Douglas.

561
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,816
JOKER:
And are you the real Batman?

562
00:42:38,983 --> 00:42:40,026
BRIAN: No.
JOKER: No?

563
00:42:40,192 --> 00:42:42,153
- No.
- No?

564
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,030
Then why do you dress up like him?

565
00:42:46,782 --> 00:42:50,870
BRIAN: Because he's a symbol that we
don 't have to be afraid of scum like you.

566
00:42:51,037 --> 00:42:54,373
Yeah. You do, Brian. You really do.

567
00:42:58,336 --> 00:43:02,798
So you think Batman 's
made Gotham a better place? Hm?

568
00:43:03,007 --> 00:43:04,550
Look at me.

569
00:43:04,717 --> 00:43:07,011
Look at me!

570
00:43:10,765 --> 00:43:14,268
You see, this is how crazy
Batman 's made Gotham.

571
00:43:14,435 --> 00:43:16,729
You want order in Gotham...

572
00:43:17,063 --> 00:43:21,484
...Batman must take off his mask
and turn himself in.

573
00:43:21,651 --> 00:43:25,446
Oh, and every day he doesn 't,
people will die.

574
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,907
Starting tonight.

575
00:43:28,324 --> 00:43:30,535
I'm a man of my word.

576
00:43:47,802 --> 00:43:50,638
Harvey Dent,
scourge of the underworld...

577
00:43:50,805 --> 00:43:53,891
...scared stiff by the trust-fund brigade.

578
00:43:54,058 --> 00:43:55,309
- I'll be back.
- Rachel.

579
00:43:55,476 --> 00:43:58,312
A little liquid courage, Mr. Dent?

580
00:43:58,479 --> 00:44:00,898
- Thank you. Alfred, right?
- That's right, sir.

581
00:44:01,065 --> 00:44:04,360
Rachel talks about you all the time.
You've known her her whole life.

582
00:44:04,527 --> 00:44:05,778
Not yet, sir.

583
00:44:08,072 --> 00:44:10,324
Any psychotic ex-boyfriends
I should be aware of?

584
00:44:10,491 --> 00:44:12,743
Oh, you have no idea.

585
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:33,097
BRUCE: I'm sorry that I'm late.

586
00:44:33,264 --> 00:44:35,641
I'm glad to see
that you all got started without me.

587
00:44:35,808 --> 00:44:39,520
Now, where is Harvey? Where...?

588
00:44:39,687 --> 00:44:42,106
Harvey Dent, the man of the hour.

589
00:44:42,273 --> 00:44:43,608
Where's Rachel Dawes?

590
00:44:43,774 --> 00:44:46,152
She is my oldest friend. Come here.

591
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,821
When Rachel first told me she
was dating Harvey Dent...

592
00:44:48,988 --> 00:44:50,197
...I had one thing to say:

593
00:44:50,406 --> 00:44:52,825
"The guy from those God-awful
campaign commercials?"

594
00:44:52,992 --> 00:44:56,829
"I believe in Harvey Dent."
Yeah, nice slogan, Harvey.

595
00:44:56,996 --> 00:44:58,998
But it caught Rachel's attention.

596
00:44:59,165 --> 00:45:02,168
And then I started to pay attention
to Harvey...

597
00:45:02,585 --> 00:45:05,880
...and all that he's been doing
as our new DA.

598
00:45:06,047 --> 00:45:07,840
And you know what?

599
00:45:09,884 --> 00:45:11,385
I believe in Harvey Dent.

600
00:45:11,552 --> 00:45:15,139
I believe that on his watch,
Gotham can feel...

601
00:45:15,306 --> 00:45:18,976
...a little safer, a little more optimistic.

602
00:45:20,394 --> 00:45:24,732
Look at this face. This is the face
of Gotham's bright future.

603
00:45:24,899 --> 00:45:27,068
To Harvey Dent. Let's hear it for him.

604
00:45:27,443 --> 00:45:28,986
MAN:
Harvey.

605
00:45:38,496 --> 00:45:39,956
Harvey may not know you
well enough...

606
00:45:40,122 --> 00:45:42,083
...to understand you're
making fun of him...

607
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,252
...but I do.
- No, I meant every word.

608
00:45:45,586 --> 00:45:48,506
You know that day
that you once told me about...

609
00:45:48,673 --> 00:45:50,758
...when Gotham would no longer
need Batman?

610
00:45:50,925 --> 00:45:52,843
- It's coming.
- Bruce.

611
00:45:53,678 --> 00:45:59,267
- You can't ask me to wait for that.
- It's happening now. Harvey is that hero.

612
00:45:59,433 --> 00:46:03,896
He locked up half of the city's criminals,
and he did it without wearing a mask.

613
00:46:04,063 --> 00:46:06,274
Gotham needs a hero with a face.

614
00:46:07,108 --> 00:46:09,402
DENT: You can throw a party, Wayne,
I'll give you that.

615
00:46:10,778 --> 00:46:12,697
Thanks again.

616
00:46:13,489 --> 00:46:15,199
You mind if I borrow Rachel?

617
00:46:18,661 --> 00:46:21,038
Lieutenant, that joker card
pinned to the body?

618
00:46:21,205 --> 00:46:22,957
Forensics found three sets of DNA.

619
00:46:23,124 --> 00:46:24,542
- Any matches?
- All three.

620
00:46:24,709 --> 00:46:28,212
The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.

621
00:46:28,379 --> 00:46:30,381
The Joker's telling us
who he's targeting.

622
00:46:30,548 --> 00:46:33,426
Get a unit over to Surrillo's house.
Tell Wuertz to find Dent.

623
00:46:33,593 --> 00:46:35,636
Get them both to Protective custody.
Where's the commissioner?

624
00:46:35,803 --> 00:46:37,305
- City hall.
- Seal the building.

625
00:46:37,471 --> 00:46:39,473
- No one in or out till I get there.
- Got it.

626
00:46:51,777 --> 00:46:54,155
Gordon. What are you up to?

627
00:46:54,322 --> 00:46:57,575
We're secure. I want a floor-by-floor
search of the entire building.

628
00:46:57,742 --> 00:47:00,328
We believe the Joker's
made a threat against your life.

629
00:47:00,494 --> 00:47:01,913
These are dangerous people.

630
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:03,831
You're not giving me
a lot of information.

631
00:47:03,998 --> 00:47:05,958
Even we don't know
where you're going.

632
00:47:06,125 --> 00:47:09,462
Take the envelope, get in, open it.
It'll tell you where you're headed.

633
00:47:13,299 --> 00:47:15,218
You can't leave me alone
with these people.

634
00:47:15,384 --> 00:47:18,429
The whole Mob's after you
and you're worried about these guys?

635
00:47:18,596 --> 00:47:20,556
Compared to this,
the Mob doesn't scare me.

636
00:47:20,723 --> 00:47:24,310
Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this
for yourself, so...

637
00:47:24,477 --> 00:47:28,564
...take my word, the police commissioner
earns a lot of threats.

638
00:47:28,731 --> 00:47:34,278
I found the appropriate response
to these situations a long time ago.

639
00:47:34,487 --> 00:47:36,739
Them gunning for you
makes you see things clearly.

640
00:47:36,906 --> 00:47:38,241
Yeah, I bet.

641
00:47:38,407 --> 00:47:42,703
Yeah. It makes you think about things
you couldn't stand losing...

642
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:44,872
...about who you wanna
spend your life with.

643
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:48,042
- That's a pretty big commitment.
- Not if the Mob has their way.

644
00:47:53,256 --> 00:47:55,967
You get to explain to my wife...

645
00:47:56,884 --> 00:47:58,469
...why I'm late for dinner.

646
00:47:58,636 --> 00:48:01,806
Sir, the joker card
had traces of your DNA on it.

647
00:48:03,391 --> 00:48:06,018
- Don't do that.
- All right.

648
00:48:06,561 --> 00:48:09,480
- Let's be serious, then.
- Okay.

649
00:48:09,814 --> 00:48:10,856
What's your answer?

650
00:48:17,029 --> 00:48:18,531
I don't have an answer.

651
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:21,742
How'd they get my DNA?

652
00:48:21,909 --> 00:48:24,078
Somebody with access
to your office or house...

653
00:48:24,245 --> 00:48:26,873
...must have lifted a tissue
or a glass... Wait! Wait!

654
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:29,959
- Well, I guess no answer is a no.
- Harvey.

655
00:48:30,126 --> 00:48:32,253
- It's someone else, isn't it?
- Harvey.

656
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:35,590
Just tell me it's not Wayne.
The guy's a complete f...

657
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:37,550
What are you doing?

658
00:48:48,728 --> 00:48:49,770
GORDON:
Oh, shit.

659
00:48:55,943 --> 00:48:57,695
GORDON:
Get a medic!

660
00:49:01,115 --> 00:49:02,241
They've come for him.

661
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,911
We made it.

662
00:49:07,496 --> 00:49:08,539
Stay hidden.

663
00:49:10,791 --> 00:49:14,128
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

664
00:49:17,048 --> 00:49:20,968
We are tonight's entertainment.

665
00:49:21,802 --> 00:49:24,138
I only have one question:

666
00:49:24,347 --> 00:49:27,892
Where is Harvey Dent?

667
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,445
You know where Harvey is?
You know who he is?

668
00:49:39,612 --> 00:49:40,905
THUG:
Hands up, pretty boy.

669
00:49:48,037 --> 00:49:50,831
Do you know where I can find Harvey?
I need to talk to him.

670
00:49:50,998 --> 00:49:53,834
Just something little, huh? No.

671
00:49:56,128 --> 00:49:58,881
What's going on out there? Wayne!

672
00:50:00,341 --> 00:50:01,717
Oh, thank God, you've
got a panic room.

673
00:50:01,884 --> 00:50:03,052
MAN: Hey, wait...

674
00:50:03,636 --> 00:50:05,429
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

675
00:50:05,721 --> 00:50:07,723
You know, I'll settle for his loved ones.

676
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:11,394
We're not intimidated by thugs.

677
00:50:12,353 --> 00:50:14,063
You know...

678
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:18,693
...you remind me of my father.

679
00:50:19,151 --> 00:50:20,987
I hated my father.

680
00:50:21,153 --> 00:50:23,197
RACHEL:
Okay, stop.

681
00:50:27,034 --> 00:50:29,871
Well, hello, beautiful.

682
00:50:32,039 --> 00:50:35,877
You must be Harvey's squeeze. Hm?

683
00:50:36,252 --> 00:50:38,754
And you are beautiful.

684
00:50:45,678 --> 00:50:49,557
You look nervous. Is it the scars?

685
00:50:50,474 --> 00:50:52,685
You wanna know how I got them?

686
00:50:53,895 --> 00:50:56,439
Come here. Hey.

687
00:50:56,814 --> 00:50:58,524
Look at me.

688
00:50:58,983 --> 00:51:03,738
So I had a wife.
She was beautiful, like you...

689
00:51:03,988 --> 00:51:08,201
...who tells me I worry too much...

690
00:51:08,367 --> 00:51:11,287
...who tells me I ought to smile more...

691
00:51:11,454 --> 00:51:16,959
...who gambles and gets in deep
with the sharks. Hey.

692
00:51:17,376 --> 00:51:19,795
One day they carve her face.

693
00:51:20,296 --> 00:51:24,550
And we have no money for surgeries.
She can't take it.

694
00:51:24,926 --> 00:51:28,429
I just wanna see her smile again. Hm?

695
00:51:28,763 --> 00:51:31,682
I just want her to know
that I don't care about the scars.

696
00:51:32,225 --> 00:51:33,768
So...

697
00:51:34,352 --> 00:51:38,022
...I stick a razor in my mouth
and do this...

698
00:51:38,481 --> 00:51:39,857
...to myself.

699
00:51:40,149 --> 00:51:45,238
And you know what?
She can't stand the sight of me.

700
00:51:45,404 --> 00:51:46,948
She leaves.

701
00:51:47,657 --> 00:51:50,076
Now I see the funny side.

702
00:51:50,952 --> 00:51:52,537
Now I'm always smiling.

703
00:51:55,957 --> 00:51:59,293
You got a little fight in you. I like that.

704
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:00,795
BATMAN:
Then you're gonna love me.

705
00:52:28,948 --> 00:52:30,157
Drop the gun.

706
00:52:30,324 --> 00:52:32,952
Oh, sure. You just take off
your little mask...

707
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,329
...and show us all who
you really are. Hm?

708
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,169
Let her go.

709
00:52:42,962 --> 00:52:44,380
Very poor choice of words.

710
00:53:07,195 --> 00:53:09,071
Are you all right?

711
00:53:11,324 --> 00:53:13,701
Let's not do that again.

712
00:53:13,993 --> 00:53:16,495
- Is Harvey okay?
- He's safe.

713
00:53:18,039 --> 00:53:19,373
Thank you.

714
00:53:19,707 --> 00:53:20,750
Jim, it's over.

715
00:53:20,917 --> 00:53:23,502
As long as they don't get to Lau,
we've cut off their funds.

716
00:53:23,669 --> 00:53:25,171
The prosecution's over.

717
00:53:25,338 --> 00:53:27,006
Nobody's standing up
in front of a judge...

718
00:53:27,173 --> 00:53:30,176
...while judges and police commissioners
are getting blown away.

719
00:53:30,343 --> 00:53:32,136
- What about Dent?
- He's got any sense...

720
00:53:32,303 --> 00:53:33,387
...Dent's halfway to Mex...

721
00:53:33,554 --> 00:53:35,139
DENT:
So where do you keep your trash?

722
00:53:36,474 --> 00:53:40,436
You're due in court. I need you alive
long enough to get you on the record.

723
00:53:40,603 --> 00:53:43,648
You can't protect me.
You can't even protect yourselves.

724
00:53:43,814 --> 00:53:47,151
You refuse to cooperate, you're not
coming back here, you go to County.

725
00:53:47,318 --> 00:53:49,779
How long do you calculate
you'll last in there?

726
00:53:51,197 --> 00:53:52,698
Targeting me won't get their money.

727
00:53:52,865 --> 00:53:54,700
I knew the Mob wouldn't go
down easily...

728
00:53:54,867 --> 00:53:56,953
...but this is different.
They crossed a line.

729
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,371
You crossed the line first.

730
00:53:58,538 --> 00:54:01,958
You squeezed them, you hammered them
to the point of desperation.

731
00:54:02,124 --> 00:54:07,129
And in their desperation, they turned to
a man they didn't fully understand.

732
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:10,174
Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.

733
00:54:10,341 --> 00:54:12,552
We just need to figure out
what he's after.

734
00:54:12,718 --> 00:54:14,136
ALFRED:
With respect, Master Wayne...

735
00:54:14,303 --> 00:54:17,265
...perhaps this is a man
you don't fully understand either.

736
00:54:18,057 --> 00:54:20,768
A long time ago, I was in Burma...

737
00:54:20,935 --> 00:54:24,355
...and my friends and I were working
for the local government.

738
00:54:24,522 --> 00:54:27,108
They were trying to buy
the loyalty of tribal leaders...

739
00:54:27,275 --> 00:54:30,111
...by bribing them with
precious stones...

740
00:54:30,278 --> 00:54:34,866
...but their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.

741
00:54:35,032 --> 00:54:38,327
So we went looking for the stones.

742
00:54:38,703 --> 00:54:43,833
But in six months, we never
met anyone who traded with him.

743
00:54:44,458 --> 00:54:48,462
One day, I saw a child
playing with a ruby...

744
00:54:48,629 --> 00:54:51,674
...the size of a tangerine.

745
00:54:51,924 --> 00:54:55,303
The bandit had been
throwing them away.

746
00:54:55,970 --> 00:54:58,681
- So why steal them?
- Because he thought it was good sport.

747
00:54:58,848 --> 00:55:03,811
Because some men aren't looking
for anything logical, like money.

748
00:55:03,978 --> 00:55:08,232
They can't be bought, bullied,
reasoned or negotiated with.

749
00:55:08,649 --> 00:55:12,486
Some men just wanna
watch the world burn.

750
00:55:32,924 --> 00:55:34,091
WOMAN:
Your name, sir?

751
00:55:34,258 --> 00:55:37,428
JOKER: Eighth and Orchard.
You'll find Harvey Dent there.

752
00:55:50,316 --> 00:55:51,776
BATMAN:
Check the names.

753
00:55:58,366 --> 00:56:00,076
"Richard Dent."

754
00:56:02,286 --> 00:56:03,371
"Patrick Harvey."

755
00:56:03,663 --> 00:56:04,705
Harvey Dent.

756
00:56:04,872 --> 00:56:07,875
I need 10 minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it.

757
00:56:08,084 --> 00:56:10,294
It's because of you
these guys are dead...

758
00:56:10,461 --> 00:56:12,004
Detective!

759
00:56:14,215 --> 00:56:16,259
Give us a minute, guys.

760
00:56:17,468 --> 00:56:19,053
That's brick underneath.

761
00:56:19,387 --> 00:56:21,055
Gonna take ballistics
off a shattered bullet?

762
00:56:21,222 --> 00:56:22,848
No.

763
00:56:24,308 --> 00:56:26,227
Fingerprints.

764
00:56:34,777 --> 00:56:36,696
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

765
00:56:38,489 --> 00:56:44,036
Because we found his next target.
He's put it in tomorrow's paper.

766
00:57:00,511 --> 00:57:02,805
I'm not sure
you made it loud enough, sir.

767
00:57:15,902 --> 00:57:18,029
What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?

768
00:57:18,196 --> 00:57:21,991
You wanted me to do the diligence
on the LSI Holdings deal again.

769
00:57:22,658 --> 00:57:24,952
Well, I found some irregularities.

770
00:57:25,369 --> 00:57:27,455
Their CEO is in police custody.

771
00:57:27,622 --> 00:57:30,541
No, not with their numbers, with yours.

772
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,836
Applied Sciences. Whole division
of Wayne Enterprises...

773
00:57:34,003 --> 00:57:35,671
...just disappeared overnight.

774
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:40,092
I went down to the archives
and I started pulling some old files.

775
00:57:41,219 --> 00:57:43,095
Don't tell me you didn't
recognize your baby...

776
00:57:43,262 --> 00:57:46,891
...pancaking cop cars
on the evening news.

777
00:57:47,183 --> 00:57:50,394
Now you got the entire R & D
Department burning through cash...

778
00:57:50,561 --> 00:57:53,898
...claiming it's related to
cell phones for the Army?

779
00:57:54,065 --> 00:57:57,151
What are you building for him now,
a rocket ship?

780
00:57:59,028 --> 00:58:00,780
I want...

781
00:58:00,947 --> 00:58:04,867
...$ 10 million a year
for the rest of my life.

782
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:09,497
Let me get this straight.

783
00:58:10,706 --> 00:58:13,167
You think that your client...

784
00:58:13,334 --> 00:58:16,420
One of the wealthiest,
most powerful men in the world...

785
00:58:16,587 --> 00:58:18,172
...is secretly a vigilante...

786
00:58:18,339 --> 00:58:23,010
...who spends his nights beating
criminals to a pulp with his bare hands...

787
00:58:23,177 --> 00:58:26,347
...and your plan
is to blackmail this person?

788
00:58:33,813 --> 00:58:35,106
Good luck.

789
00:58:37,984 --> 00:58:39,402
When...

790
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,280
Keep that.

791
00:58:48,953 --> 00:58:51,414
FOX:
This is your original scan.

792
00:58:52,832 --> 00:58:55,126
Here it is reengineered.

793
00:59:03,342 --> 00:59:06,888
And there's the thumbprint he left
when he pushed the round in the clip.

794
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:10,057
I'll get you a copy.

795
00:59:10,266 --> 00:59:14,061
Mr. Wayne, did you reassign R & D?

796
00:59:14,228 --> 00:59:16,731
Yeah. Government
telecommunications project.

797
00:59:16,898 --> 00:59:18,941
Wasn't aware
we had any government contracts.

798
00:59:19,191 --> 00:59:22,195
You know, Lucius, I'm playing this one
pretty close to the chest.

799
00:59:23,321 --> 00:59:25,031
Fair enough.

800
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:29,410
ENGEL: With no word
from the Batman...

801
00:59:29,577 --> 00:59:31,078
...even as they mourn
Commissioner Loeb...

802
00:59:31,245 --> 00:59:34,624
...these cops have to wonder if
the Joker will make good on his threat...

803
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:38,002
...in the obituary column of
The Gotham Times to kill the mayor.

804
00:59:39,795 --> 00:59:43,466
I've checked all the databases.
There are four possibles.

805
00:59:43,633 --> 00:59:45,760
Cross-reference the addresses.

806
00:59:45,927 --> 00:59:49,931
Look for Parkside,
overlooking the parade.

807
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:52,266
I got one.

808
00:59:52,433 --> 00:59:56,437
Melvin White,
1502 Randolph Apartments.

809
00:59:56,812 --> 01:00:00,900
Aggravated assault,
moved to Arkham twice.

810
01:00:39,981 --> 01:00:41,566
What do you got on the roof?

811
01:00:41,732 --> 01:00:45,278
We're tight, but frankly,
there's a lot of windows up here.

812
01:00:53,828 --> 01:00:57,874
Commissioner Loeb dedicated his life
to law enforcement...

813
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,334
...and to the protection
of his community.

814
01:01:00,501 --> 01:01:02,295
I remember when I first took office...

815
01:01:02,461 --> 01:01:05,006
...and I asked if he wanted
to stay on as commissioner.

816
01:01:05,172 --> 01:01:10,428
And he said he would, provided
I kept my politics out of his office.

817
01:01:14,181 --> 01:01:17,351
Clearly he was not a man who minced
words, nor should he have been.

818
01:01:18,519 --> 01:01:22,023
A number of policies that he enacted
as commissioner were unpopular.

819
01:01:22,189 --> 01:01:25,443
Policies that flooded my office
with angry calls and letters...

820
01:01:29,822 --> 01:01:31,490
- Who's that?
- What happened?

821
01:01:32,533 --> 01:01:34,410
They took our guns.

822
01:01:34,577 --> 01:01:36,370
And our uniforms.

823
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,713
MAYOR: And as we recognize
the sacrifice of this man...

824
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:49,842
...we must remember that vigilance
is the price of safety.

825
01:01:50,009 --> 01:01:52,511
Stand by. Honor guard.

826
01:01:52,678 --> 01:01:56,307
Attention. Port arms.

827
01:01:57,516 --> 01:02:01,896
Ready! Aim! Fire!

828
01:02:02,688 --> 01:02:04,232
Ready! Aim!

829
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:10,238
Ready! Aim!

830
01:02:18,663 --> 01:02:20,081
OFFICER:
Stay down! Don't move!

831
01:02:21,916 --> 01:02:23,584
STEPHENS:
Mr. Mayor. Get him out of here.

832
01:02:32,802 --> 01:02:35,054
- I'll see you later.
- Why are you going back?

833
01:02:47,692 --> 01:02:48,734
Get out of here.

834
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:54,532
Tell me what you know about the Joker.

835
01:03:25,563 --> 01:03:26,898
No.

836
01:03:27,315 --> 01:03:28,649
I'm sorry, Barbara.

837
01:03:29,567 --> 01:03:32,820
Jimmy, go play with your sister.
Go ahead, honey.

838
01:03:32,987 --> 01:03:35,239
STEPHENS: If there's anything
we can do, anything you need...

839
01:03:35,406 --> 01:03:37,158
...we're here for you.

840
01:03:40,828 --> 01:03:42,079
BARBARA:
Are you out there?

841
01:03:43,414 --> 01:03:47,919
Are you? You brought this
craziness on us. You did!

842
01:03:48,085 --> 01:03:50,463
You brought this on us!

843
01:03:51,505 --> 01:03:56,093
Switch it off, he ain't coming.
He doesn't wanna talk to us.

844
01:03:56,510 --> 01:03:59,513
God help whoever
he does wanna talk to.

845
01:04:01,182 --> 01:04:04,101
Can't we go someplace quieter?
We can't hear each other talk.

846
01:04:04,268 --> 01:04:07,104
What makes you think
I wanna hear you talk?

847
01:04:07,271 --> 01:04:08,314
What?

848
01:04:37,718 --> 01:04:39,345
- Yeah?
MAN: Second.

849
01:04:39,512 --> 01:04:40,555
Okay.

850
01:04:40,721 --> 01:04:42,890
- Harvey, where are you?
DENT: Where are you?

851
01:04:43,057 --> 01:04:45,184
I'm where you should be,
at Major Crimes.

852
01:04:45,351 --> 01:04:46,894
I'm trying to deal with all of this mess.

853
01:04:47,061 --> 01:04:50,648
- Can I get the fingerprint analysis?
- Rachel, listen. You're not safe there.

854
01:04:50,815 --> 01:04:52,608
- This is Gordon's unit.
- Gordon 's gone.

855
01:04:52,775 --> 01:04:56,362
RACHEL: He vouched for these men.
- And he's gone.

856
01:05:00,992 --> 01:05:03,077
The Joker's named you next.

857
01:05:03,244 --> 01:05:06,247
God, is there someone, is there anyone
in this town we can trust?

858
01:05:06,414 --> 01:05:08,124
Bruce.

859
01:05:08,416 --> 01:05:09,584
We can trust Bruce Wayne.

860
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:11,335
No. Rachel, I know
you're his friend, but...

861
01:05:11,502 --> 01:05:13,337
Harvey, trust me.

862
01:05:13,504 --> 01:05:16,257
Bruce's penthouse is now
the safest place in the city.

863
01:05:16,424 --> 01:05:17,758
Then you go straight there.

864
01:05:17,925 --> 01:05:20,052
Don 't tell anybody
and I'll find you there.

865
01:05:20,219 --> 01:05:21,929
I love you.

866
01:05:35,943 --> 01:05:37,195
I want the Joker.

867
01:05:38,404 --> 01:05:40,072
From one professional to another...

868
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:42,783
...you're trying to scare somebody,
pick a better spot.

869
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:45,536
From this height,
the fall wouldn't kill me.

870
01:05:45,703 --> 01:05:47,288
- I'm counting on it.
- Huh!

871
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:57,798
- Where is he?
- I don't know where he is. He found us.

872
01:05:57,965 --> 01:05:59,258
He must have friends.

873
01:05:59,592 --> 01:06:01,886
Friends? Have you met this guy?

874
01:06:02,053 --> 01:06:03,638
Someone knows where he is.

875
01:06:03,804 --> 01:06:06,307
Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.

876
01:06:06,474 --> 01:06:07,808
They're wise to your act.

877
01:06:07,975 --> 01:06:11,979
You got rules.
The Joker, he's got no rules.

878
01:06:12,146 --> 01:06:17,026
Nobody's gonna cross him for you.
If you want this guy, you got one way.

879
01:06:17,193 --> 01:06:18,986
But you already know what that is.

880
01:06:19,153 --> 01:06:21,948
Just take off that mask,
let him come find you.

881
01:06:23,574 --> 01:06:27,662
Or you can let a couple more people
get killed while you make up your mind.

882
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:31,332
You wanna play games?

883
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:38,673
How's that feel?

884
01:06:38,839 --> 01:06:41,467
- You wouldn't.
- I wouldn't!

885
01:06:42,969 --> 01:06:44,595
- You don't think I will?
- Mm-mm.

886
01:06:44,762 --> 01:06:46,806
- You don't think I will?
- Mm-mm.

887
01:06:48,182 --> 01:06:51,394
No. No, I wouldn't.

888
01:06:52,603 --> 01:06:55,147
That's why I'm not
gonna leave it up to me.

889
01:06:56,148 --> 01:06:59,151
Heads, you get to keep your head.

890
01:06:59,569 --> 01:07:01,195
Tails...

891
01:07:02,154 --> 01:07:03,197
...not so lucky.

892
01:07:03,573 --> 01:07:07,118
So you wanna tell me about the Joker?

893
01:07:16,502 --> 01:07:20,214
- Let's go again.
- I don't know anything! God, don't!

894
01:07:20,381 --> 01:07:22,758
You're not playing the odds, friend.

895
01:07:23,885 --> 01:07:25,887
Let's do it again.

896
01:07:28,723 --> 01:07:30,558
You'd leave a man's life to chance?

897
01:07:31,309 --> 01:07:34,896
- Not exactly.
- His name's Schiff, Thomas.

898
01:07:35,062 --> 01:07:38,065
He's a paranoid schizophrenic,
former patient at Arkham.

899
01:07:38,232 --> 01:07:42,862
The kind of mind the Joker attracts.
What do you expect to learn from him?

900
01:07:46,199 --> 01:07:48,993
The Joker killed Gordon.
He's gonna kill Rachel.

901
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:51,954
You're the symbol of hope
I could never be.

902
01:07:52,121 --> 01:07:53,956
Your stand against organized crime...

903
01:07:54,123 --> 01:07:57,335
...is the first legitimate ray of light
in Gotham in decades.

904
01:07:57,501 --> 01:08:01,130
If anyone saw this,
everything would be undone.

905
01:08:01,297 --> 01:08:03,591
The criminals you arrested
would be released...

906
01:08:03,758 --> 01:08:06,844
...and Jim Gordon
will have died for nothing.

907
01:08:07,470 --> 01:08:09,722
You're gonna hold
a press conference tomorrow.

908
01:08:09,889 --> 01:08:12,266
- Why?
- No one else will die because of me.

909
01:08:12,433 --> 01:08:14,769
Gotham's in your hands now.

910
01:08:14,936 --> 01:08:16,646
You can't.

911
01:08:16,812 --> 01:08:18,189
You can't give in.

912
01:08:18,481 --> 01:08:21,025
You can't give in!

913
01:08:36,374 --> 01:08:37,625
Harvey called.

914
01:08:37,792 --> 01:08:40,836
He said Batman's gonna turn himself in.

915
01:08:41,003 --> 01:08:42,129
I have no choice.

916
01:08:42,296 --> 01:08:45,383
You honestly think that's gonna
keep the Joker from killing people?

917
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:49,011
Maybe not. But I have enough blood
on my hands.

918
01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:54,308
And I've seen now what I would
have to become to stop men like him.

919
01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:58,312
You once told me that
if the day came when I was finished...

920
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:00,565
...that we'd be together.

921
01:09:01,274 --> 01:09:04,443
Bruce, don't make me
your one hope for a normal life.

922
01:09:05,987 --> 01:09:07,321
Did you mean it?

923
01:09:08,823 --> 01:09:10,658
Yes.

924
01:09:27,925 --> 01:09:29,719
Bruce.

925
01:09:30,678 --> 01:09:34,599
If you turn yourself in,
they're not gonna let us be together.

926
01:09:45,234 --> 01:09:48,196
ALFRED: Logs as well?
BRUCE: Everything.

927
01:09:48,362 --> 01:09:51,741
Anything that could lead back
to Lucius or Rachel.

928
01:09:57,079 --> 01:10:00,374
People are dying, Alfred.
What would you have me do?

929
01:10:00,541 --> 01:10:04,295
Endure, Master Wayne. Take it.

930
01:10:04,462 --> 01:10:08,174
They'll hate you for it,
but that's the point of Batman.

931
01:10:08,341 --> 01:10:13,888
He can be the outcast. He can make
the choice that no one else can make.

932
01:10:14,055 --> 01:10:15,389
The right choice.

933
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:18,935
No, today I found out
what Batman can't do.

934
01:10:19,101 --> 01:10:20,353
He can't endure this.

935
01:10:20,645 --> 01:10:23,523
Today you get to say "I told you so."

936
01:10:24,106 --> 01:10:27,276
Today, I don't want to.

937
01:10:33,115 --> 01:10:34,575
But I did bloody tell you.

938
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:40,623
ALFRED: I suppose they're gonna
lock me up as well...

939
01:10:41,415 --> 01:10:42,667
...as your accomplice.

940
01:10:42,833 --> 01:10:47,588
BRUCE: Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them
the whole thing was your idea.

941
01:10:51,842 --> 01:10:55,388
Ladies and gentlemen, I've called
this press conference for two reasons.

942
01:10:55,555 --> 01:10:57,598
Firstly, to assure the citizens
of Gotham...

943
01:10:57,765 --> 01:11:01,435
...that everything that can be done
over the Joker killings is being done.

944
01:11:02,812 --> 01:11:05,898
Secondly, because the Batman
has offered to turn himself in.

945
01:11:06,065 --> 01:11:07,775
But let's consider the situation.

946
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:10,778
Should we give in
to this terrorist's demands?

947
01:11:10,945 --> 01:11:12,405
Do we really think he's gonna...?

948
01:11:12,572 --> 01:11:15,950
You'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante
than the lives of citizens?

949
01:11:16,117 --> 01:11:18,494
The Batman is an outlaw.

950
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:21,289
That's not why we demand
he turn himself in...

951
01:11:21,455 --> 01:11:23,124
...we're doing it because we're scared.

952
01:11:23,291 --> 01:11:26,085
We've been happy to let Batman
clean up our streets till now.

953
01:11:26,252 --> 01:11:29,213
MAN 1: Things are worse than ever!
MAN 2: Amen.

954
01:11:30,548 --> 01:11:32,466
Yes, they are.

955
01:11:34,969 --> 01:11:37,972
But the night is darkest
just before the dawn.

956
01:11:40,433 --> 01:11:42,518
And I promise you...

957
01:11:43,311 --> 01:11:44,729
...the dawn is coming.

958
01:11:44,896 --> 01:11:49,442
One day, the Batman will have to answer
for the laws he's broken. But to us...

959
01:11:49,609 --> 01:11:51,360
...not to this madman.

960
01:11:51,527 --> 01:11:53,863
- No more dead cops!
OFFICERS: Yeah!

961
01:11:57,158 --> 01:11:58,743
He should turn himself in!

962
01:11:58,910 --> 01:12:01,621
MAN 3: Give us the Batman! Come on!
MAN 4: Where is he?

963
01:12:04,498 --> 01:12:06,667
So be it. Take the Batman into custody.

964
01:12:07,126 --> 01:12:09,086
WOMAN: What?
MAN 5: Is he here?

965
01:12:09,795 --> 01:12:10,838
I am the Batman.

966
01:12:11,172 --> 01:12:14,175
MAN 6: What?
MAN 7: Come on.

967
01:12:22,558 --> 01:12:24,477
RACHEL:
Alfred.

968
01:12:25,811 --> 01:12:27,605
Why is he letting Harvey do this?

969
01:12:27,772 --> 01:12:30,775
- He went down to the press conference.
- I know. He just stood by.

970
01:12:30,942 --> 01:12:33,027
Perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent...

971
01:12:33,194 --> 01:12:36,197
...believe that Batman stands for
something more important...

972
01:12:36,364 --> 01:12:38,699
...than the whims of a terrorist,
Miss Dawes...

973
01:12:38,866 --> 01:12:40,868
...even if everyone hates him for it.

974
01:12:41,035 --> 01:12:43,162
That's the sacrifice he's making.

975
01:12:43,329 --> 01:12:46,958
He's not being a hero.
He's being something more.

976
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,126
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

977
01:12:49,293 --> 01:12:52,380
Letting Harvey take the fall for this
is not heroic at all.

978
01:12:55,049 --> 01:12:56,676
You know him better than anyone.

979
01:12:57,093 --> 01:12:58,135
I do.

980
01:13:01,514 --> 01:13:04,559
Will you give this to him for me?
When the time is right?

981
01:13:06,018 --> 01:13:07,228
How will I know?

982
01:13:07,395 --> 01:13:08,896
It's not sealed.

983
01:13:10,314 --> 01:13:11,858
Goodbye, Alfred.

984
01:13:16,028 --> 01:13:17,780
Bye, Rachel.

985
01:13:25,663 --> 01:13:27,498
I didn't have time to talk this through.

986
01:13:27,665 --> 01:13:28,916
What are you doing?

987
01:13:29,083 --> 01:13:31,168
They're transferring me
to Central Holding.

988
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:35,131
This is the Joker's chance, and when he
attacks, the Batman will take him down.

989
01:13:35,298 --> 01:13:36,841
Listen. This is too dangerous.

990
01:13:37,008 --> 01:13:40,720
We get this guy to County, he's their
problem. The streets will be cleared...

991
01:13:40,887 --> 01:13:44,599
...so let's go.
The convoys stop for no reason.

992
01:13:44,765 --> 01:13:46,225
I hope you got some moves, pal.

993
01:13:46,392 --> 01:13:49,312
He's using you as bait. He doesn't
know if he can get the Joker.

994
01:13:49,478 --> 01:13:50,563
He's failed so far.

995
01:13:50,897 --> 01:13:52,440
How do you know
what he's thinking?

996
01:13:52,607 --> 01:13:54,942
I just do. Anyway,
this isn't just about you.

997
01:13:55,109 --> 01:13:56,944
What about the people
depending on you...

998
01:13:57,111 --> 01:14:00,114
...to clean the city up
and do it honorably and...?

999
01:14:05,786 --> 01:14:08,414
Harvey. Tell everyone the truth.

1000
01:14:08,789 --> 01:14:10,666
Heads, I go through with it.

1001
01:14:10,875 --> 01:14:12,793
This is your life. You can't leave...

1002
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,338
...something like that to chance.
- I'm not.

1003
01:14:19,675 --> 01:14:22,094
You make your own luck.

1004
01:14:43,908 --> 01:14:45,910
Hey, you wait like everybody else, pal.

1005
01:14:53,543 --> 01:14:55,878
What the hell is that?

1006
01:14:56,045 --> 01:14:58,256
Obstruction ahead, obstruction ahead!

1007
01:14:58,422 --> 01:15:01,634
Damn it! All units divert down
onto Lower Fifth. I repeat, exit down.

1008
01:15:02,051 --> 01:15:03,177
Exit down!

1009
01:15:03,344 --> 01:15:05,680
Lower Fifth? We'll be
like turkeys on Thanksgiving.

1010
01:15:38,379 --> 01:15:40,715
Jesus. Come on, get us out of here.
Let's go.

1011
01:15:42,884 --> 01:15:45,261
Listen, we need backup.
We've got company.

1012
01:15:45,428 --> 01:15:46,971
We got trouble, guys.

1013
01:15:49,891 --> 01:15:50,975
Lock and load!

1014
01:16:02,195 --> 01:16:03,571
The hell was that?

1015
01:16:25,426 --> 01:16:28,095
- These are built for that, right?
- He'll need something...

1016
01:16:28,262 --> 01:16:30,056
...a lot bigger to get through this.

1017
01:16:31,098 --> 01:16:32,558
What is that?

1018
01:16:33,893 --> 01:16:35,228
What is that, a bazooka?

1019
01:16:43,861 --> 01:16:45,571
I didn't sign up for this!

1020
01:17:01,921 --> 01:17:03,256
Look out.

1021
01:17:04,048 --> 01:17:05,216
Look out!

1022
01:17:27,488 --> 01:17:28,614
Come on, let's go!

1023
01:18:15,174 --> 01:18:17,385
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent.

1024
01:18:17,552 --> 01:18:20,388
Oh, excuse me. I wanna drive.

1025
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:28,897
COMPUTER: Scanning all systems.
Scanning all systems.

1026
01:18:36,362 --> 01:18:38,489
We gotta get topside.
We need air support, now!

1027
01:18:43,995 --> 01:18:45,872
I like this job. I like it.

1028
01:18:48,124 --> 01:18:50,752
COMPUTER: Damage catastrophic.
Eject sequence initiated.

1029
01:19:04,724 --> 01:19:06,226
Goodbye.

1030
01:19:15,318 --> 01:19:18,529
We're on point, ready to give them
some of their own medicine.

1031
01:19:24,911 --> 01:19:27,372
That's what I'm talking about. Air cav.

1032
01:19:40,927 --> 01:19:42,637
Okay, rack them up.

1033
01:19:42,804 --> 01:19:45,181
Rack them up, rack them up,
rack them up.

1034
01:20:10,915 --> 01:20:12,083
That's not good.

1035
01:20:15,587 --> 01:20:16,796
Okay, that's not good!

1036
01:20:59,923 --> 01:21:02,008
Now, there's a Batman.

1037
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:07,513
Ooh, you wanna play. Come on.

1038
01:21:10,433 --> 01:21:11,559
Come on.

1039
01:21:20,693 --> 01:21:21,945
He missed!

1040
01:21:35,875 --> 01:21:38,294
You can't stop here.
We're like sitting ducks!

1041
01:21:55,311 --> 01:21:56,396
Come on, come on.

1042
01:21:59,524 --> 01:22:02,902
Come on. Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on!

1043
01:22:05,446 --> 01:22:06,906
Come on.

1044
01:22:07,574 --> 01:22:10,910
Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on, hit me.

1045
01:22:11,077 --> 01:22:12,704
Come on, hit me. Come on, hit me!

1046
01:22:14,831 --> 01:22:15,873
Hit me!

1047
01:22:40,857 --> 01:22:44,110
Come on, come on. Aah!

1048
01:22:44,277 --> 01:22:46,529
Could you please just give me a minute?

1049
01:22:48,615 --> 01:22:50,450
We got you, you son of a bitch.

1050
01:22:53,745 --> 01:22:57,665
Gor... You do like to play things
pretty close to the chest.

1051
01:22:58,124 --> 01:22:59,834
We got him, Harvey.

1052
01:23:00,001 --> 01:23:03,463
REPORTER 1: Mr. Dent! How does it feel
to be the biggest hero in Gotham?

1053
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:06,925
No, I'm no hero.
Gotham's finest, they're the heroes.

1054
01:23:07,091 --> 01:23:08,426
REPORTER 1: But you and your office...

1055
01:23:08,593 --> 01:23:10,261
...have been working
with the Batman all along.

1056
01:23:10,428 --> 01:23:12,222
No, but I trusted him
to do the right thing.

1057
01:23:12,388 --> 01:23:14,474
REPORTER 2: Which was?
- Saving my ass.

1058
01:23:14,641 --> 01:23:17,560
All right, people, that's enough.
Let him be. Let him be.

1059
01:23:17,727 --> 01:23:19,646
Thank you, detective.

1060
01:23:19,854 --> 01:23:21,981
I've got a date
with a pretty upset girlfriend.

1061
01:23:22,148 --> 01:23:24,525
- I figured, counselor.
REPORTER 3: Mr. Dent, sir...

1062
01:23:24,692 --> 01:23:28,821
...how about one for the front page, sir?
REPORTER 4: Mr. Dent.

1063
01:23:40,166 --> 01:23:43,336
Stand away! All of you!

1064
01:23:43,503 --> 01:23:47,006
I don't want anything for his Mob lawyer
to use, you understand?

1065
01:23:49,259 --> 01:23:51,135
Back from the dead.

1066
01:23:51,803 --> 01:23:53,346
I, uh...

1067
01:23:53,513 --> 01:23:55,431
...couldn't risk my family's safety.

1068
01:23:56,724 --> 01:23:58,560
MAYOR:
What do we got?

1069
01:24:00,228 --> 01:24:04,190
Nothing. No matches on prints,
DNA, dental.

1070
01:24:04,357 --> 01:24:07,110
Clothing is custom, no labels.

1071
01:24:07,318 --> 01:24:09,445
Nothing in his pockets
but knives and lint.

1072
01:24:09,612 --> 01:24:11,531
No name.

1073
01:24:11,864 --> 01:24:13,825
- No other alias.
MAYOR: Go home, Gordon.

1074
01:24:13,992 --> 01:24:17,078
The clown'll keep till morning.
Go get some rest.

1075
01:24:17,245 --> 01:24:19,080
You're gonna need it.

1076
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:21,916
Tomorrow you take the big job.

1077
01:24:22,584 --> 01:24:25,753
You don't have any say in the matter.
Commissioner Gordon.

1078
01:24:41,603 --> 01:24:43,730
I'm sorry, I couldn't risk your safety.

1079
01:24:50,236 --> 01:24:51,654
MURPHY:
Look at these ugly bastards.

1080
01:24:51,821 --> 01:24:53,698
- I don't feel good.
MURPHY: You're a cop killer.

1081
01:24:53,865 --> 01:24:56,200
You're lucky to be feeling anything
below the neck.

1082
01:24:56,367 --> 01:24:57,952
- Please!
- Step away from the bars!

1083
01:24:58,119 --> 01:25:00,288
THUG:
My insides hurt.

1084
01:25:14,469 --> 01:25:16,262
Did Batman save you, Daddy?

1085
01:25:18,431 --> 01:25:20,725
Actually, this time...

1086
01:25:20,892 --> 01:25:23,061
...I saved him.

1087
01:25:34,405 --> 01:25:36,032
GORDON:
Has he said anything yet?

1088
01:25:43,623 --> 01:25:47,835
Evening, commissioner.

1089
01:25:55,468 --> 01:25:57,679
Harvey Dent never made it home.

1090
01:25:57,845 --> 01:25:59,973
- Of course not.
- What have you done with him?

1091
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:02,642
Me?

1092
01:26:04,269 --> 01:26:06,396
I was right here.

1093
01:26:07,814 --> 01:26:09,649
Who did you leave him with?

1094
01:26:09,816 --> 01:26:12,652
Hm? Your people?

1095
01:26:13,778 --> 01:26:17,115
Assuming, of course,
that they are still your people...

1096
01:26:17,282 --> 01:26:19,993
...and not Maroni's.

1097
01:26:22,203 --> 01:26:24,581
Does it depress you, commissioner...

1098
01:26:24,998 --> 01:26:29,961
...to know just how alone you really are?

1099
01:26:31,963 --> 01:26:36,843
Does it make you feel responsible
for Harvey Dent's current predicament?

1100
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:39,679
- Where is he?
- What's the time?

1101
01:26:40,179 --> 01:26:41,681
What difference does that make?

1102
01:26:41,931 --> 01:26:47,395
Well, depending on the time,
he may be in one spot or several.

1103
01:26:53,776 --> 01:26:56,738
- Lf we're gonna play games...
- Mm-hm?

1104
01:26:59,908 --> 01:27:01,868
...I'm gonna need a cup of coffee.

1105
01:27:02,035 --> 01:27:06,122
Ah, the "good cop, bad cop" routine?

1106
01:27:06,789 --> 01:27:07,832
Not exactly.

1107
01:27:18,343 --> 01:27:22,388
Never start with the head. The victim
gets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next...

1108
01:27:25,558 --> 01:27:26,684
See?

1109
01:27:26,851 --> 01:27:29,187
You wanted me. Here I am.

1110
01:27:30,230 --> 01:27:32,357
JOKER [OVER SPEAKER]:
I wanted to see what you'd do.

1111
01:27:32,899 --> 01:27:35,485
And you didn't disappoint.

1112
01:27:35,652 --> 01:27:38,488
You let five people die.

1113
01:27:39,447 --> 01:27:43,117
Then you let Dent take your place.

1114
01:27:43,284 --> 01:27:45,912
- Even to a guy like me, that's cold.
- Where's Dent?

1115
01:27:46,079 --> 01:27:50,875
Those Mob fools want you gone so they
can get back to the way things were.

1116
01:27:51,376 --> 01:27:56,130
But I know the truth. There's no
going back. You've changed things.

1117
01:27:56,297 --> 01:27:58,716
- Forever.
- Then why do you wanna kill me?

1118
01:28:01,678 --> 01:28:03,096
I don't wanna kill you.

1119
01:28:03,596 --> 01:28:08,142
What would I do without you? Go back
to ripping off Mob dealers? No, no.

1120
01:28:08,309 --> 01:28:10,687
No. No, you...

1121
01:28:10,853 --> 01:28:13,273
You complete me.

1122
01:28:13,439 --> 01:28:17,777
- You're garbage who kills for money.
- Don't talk like one of them. You're not.

1123
01:28:17,944 --> 01:28:20,363
Even if you'd like to be.

1124
01:28:21,614 --> 01:28:23,449
To them, you're just a freak...

1125
01:28:24,367 --> 01:28:25,702
...like me.

1126
01:28:25,868 --> 01:28:28,162
They need you right now...

1127
01:28:28,746 --> 01:28:30,790
...but when they don't...

1128
01:28:31,332 --> 01:28:34,377
...they'll cast you out like a leper.

1129
01:28:34,544 --> 01:28:38,464
You see, their morals, their code...

1130
01:28:38,715 --> 01:28:40,884
...it's a bad joke.

1131
01:28:41,134 --> 01:28:44,470
Dropped at the first sign of trouble.

1132
01:28:45,138 --> 01:28:49,142
They're only as good as the world
allows them to be. I'll show you.

1133
01:28:49,309 --> 01:28:52,478
When the chips are down, these...

1134
01:28:52,645 --> 01:28:54,898
These civilized people...

1135
01:28:55,064 --> 01:28:57,150
...they'll eat each other.

1136
01:28:57,859 --> 01:29:00,236
See, I'm not a monster.

1137
01:29:01,613 --> 01:29:02,906
I'm just ahead of the curve.

1138
01:29:05,158 --> 01:29:06,242
Where's Dent?

1139
01:29:06,409 --> 01:29:09,329
You have all these rules,
and you think they'll save you.

1140
01:29:12,415 --> 01:29:14,834
- He's in control.
- I have one rule.

1141
01:29:15,001 --> 01:29:18,087
Oh. Then that's the rule you'll have
to break to know the truth.

1142
01:29:18,254 --> 01:29:19,422
Which is?

1143
01:29:19,589 --> 01:29:22,008
The only sensible way to live
is without rules.

1144
01:29:22,175 --> 01:29:24,844
And tonight you're gonna break
your one rule.

1145
01:29:25,011 --> 01:29:26,054
I'm considering it.

1146
01:29:26,221 --> 01:29:28,848
There's only minutes left,
so you'll have to play my game...

1147
01:29:29,015 --> 01:29:31,601
...if you wanna save one of them.

1148
01:29:32,101 --> 01:29:33,144
"Them"?

1149
01:29:33,311 --> 01:29:37,357
You know, for a while there,
I thought you really were Dent.

1150
01:29:37,523 --> 01:29:40,151
The way you threw yourself after her.

1151
01:29:46,449 --> 01:29:47,533
Look at you go.

1152
01:29:53,164 --> 01:29:56,751
Does Harvey know
about you and his little bunny?

1153
01:29:57,669 --> 01:29:59,045
Where are they?!

1154
01:29:59,212 --> 01:30:01,214
Killing is making a choice.

1155
01:30:01,381 --> 01:30:04,467
- Where are they?!
- Choose between one life or the other.

1156
01:30:05,218 --> 01:30:09,472
Your friend the district attorney,
or his blushing bride-to-be.

1157
01:30:14,644 --> 01:30:18,731
You have nothing,
nothing to threaten me with.

1158
01:30:19,148 --> 01:30:22,652
Nothing to do with all your strength.

1159
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:26,281
Don't worry, I'm gonna tell you
where they are, both of them.

1160
01:30:26,447 --> 01:30:29,492
And that's the point.
You'll have to choose.

1161
01:30:30,243 --> 01:30:33,079
He's at 25052nd Street...

1162
01:30:33,246 --> 01:30:36,583
...and she's on Avenue X at Cicero.

1163
01:30:38,668 --> 01:30:40,420
- Which one you going after?
- Rachel.

1164
01:30:41,838 --> 01:30:43,256
GORDON:
We're getting Dent!

1165
01:30:45,508 --> 01:30:48,344
25052nd Street!

1166
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:53,099
RACHEL [OVER PHONE]:
Hello?

1167
01:30:54,058 --> 01:30:56,436
Can anybody hear me?

1168
01:30:58,855 --> 01:31:01,482
Hello!

1169
01:31:05,486 --> 01:31:07,739
- Rachel?
- Harvey.

1170
01:31:07,906 --> 01:31:10,116
Oh, Harvey, thank God. Are you okay?

1171
01:31:10,283 --> 01:31:11,868
I'm all right. I'm in a...

1172
01:31:12,035 --> 01:31:15,622
I'm in a warehouse.
They got me wired to these oil drums.

1173
01:31:16,664 --> 01:31:17,874
I am too.

1174
01:31:18,416 --> 01:31:20,126
Harvey.

1175
01:31:27,383 --> 01:31:29,844
I want my phone call.

1176
01:31:30,011 --> 01:31:32,805
I want it. I want it.
I want my phone call.

1177
01:31:33,473 --> 01:31:35,308
That's nice.

1178
01:31:36,809 --> 01:31:41,648
How many of your friends have I killed?

1179
01:31:45,401 --> 01:31:46,486
I'm a 20-year man...

1180
01:31:46,653 --> 01:31:50,114
...and I know the difference between
punks who need a lesson in manners...

1181
01:31:50,281 --> 01:31:53,159
...and the freaks like you
who would just enjoy it.

1182
01:31:54,035 --> 01:31:56,496
And you killed six of my friends.

1183
01:31:56,663 --> 01:31:57,705
[MOUTHS]
Six?

1184
01:31:57,872 --> 01:32:00,333
Please. My insides hurt.

1185
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:02,252
I don't really care. Back away.

1186
01:32:02,418 --> 01:32:05,588
The boss said he'd make the voices
go away.

1187
01:32:05,755 --> 01:32:09,300
He said he'd go inside
and replace them with bright lights...

1188
01:32:09,467 --> 01:32:10,593
...like Christmas.

1189
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:13,304
You're out of your mind, pal. Back off.

1190
01:32:13,471 --> 01:32:16,307
Medic to the holding tank.
Come on. Get the door open.

1191
01:32:16,516 --> 01:32:17,684
You guys, back off!

1192
01:32:17,850 --> 01:32:20,019
Listen, we don't have a lot of time.

1193
01:32:20,186 --> 01:32:24,190
They told me that only one of us
was gonna make it...

1194
01:32:24,357 --> 01:32:27,694
...and that they were gonna
let our friends choose.

1195
01:32:30,405 --> 01:32:32,532
Okay, Rachel.

1196
01:32:33,116 --> 01:32:36,244
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be all right.
They're coming for you.

1197
01:32:36,411 --> 01:32:40,707
Listen to me. I'll help you. Just talk me
through what's going on with you.

1198
01:32:40,873 --> 01:32:42,792
Can you find something,
anything, sharp?

1199
01:32:42,959 --> 01:32:44,377
I'm trying.

1200
01:32:44,544 --> 01:32:46,713
- What's...?
- Shit.

1201
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:48,381
Harvey?

1202
01:32:52,135 --> 01:32:53,803
Harvey, what's happening?

1203
01:33:03,146 --> 01:33:06,983
All available units,
converge at 25052nd Street.

1204
01:33:07,317 --> 01:33:11,404
Do you wanna know why I use a knife?

1205
01:33:13,698 --> 01:33:15,033
Guns are too quick.

1206
01:33:15,199 --> 01:33:18,578
You can't savor all the...

1207
01:33:18,745 --> 01:33:22,081
...little emotions.

1208
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,880
You see, in their last moments...

1209
01:33:29,047 --> 01:33:31,341
...people show you who they really are.

1210
01:33:32,425 --> 01:33:38,097
So in a way, I knew your friends
better than you ever did.

1211
01:33:41,851 --> 01:33:45,271
Would you like to know
which of them were cowards?

1212
01:33:51,778 --> 01:33:53,446
OFFICER: What's that?
MEDIC: Jeez.

1213
01:33:53,655 --> 01:33:55,698
He's got some kind of a...

1214
01:33:55,865 --> 01:33:59,077
...contusion.
- I know you're gonna enjoy this.

1215
01:34:00,453 --> 01:34:04,207
I'm gonna have to try and enjoy it
even more.

1216
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:10,713
OFFICER 1:
Whoa, whoa!

1217
01:34:11,756 --> 01:34:12,799
OFFICER 2:
Just put it down.

1218
01:34:12,966 --> 01:34:15,760
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Drop the weapon now!

1219
01:34:15,927 --> 01:34:19,889
- It's my own damn fault, just shoot him!
- Let him go now! Drop it!

1220
01:34:20,181 --> 01:34:23,184
- What? Sorry?
- What do you want?

1221
01:34:24,227 --> 01:34:26,145
I just want my phone call.

1222
01:34:29,148 --> 01:34:31,818
RACHEL:
What...? What...? What's happening?

1223
01:34:31,985 --> 01:34:34,821
Just talk to me, just for one second.

1224
01:34:37,156 --> 01:34:39,826
- All right?
- Right.

1225
01:34:41,744 --> 01:34:43,162
Ow.

1226
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:45,665
- Ow.
- Shh, shh, shh.

1227
01:34:51,629 --> 01:34:53,673
Is that a phone?

1228
01:35:03,349 --> 01:35:04,684
Mount the curb!

1229
01:35:12,692 --> 01:35:16,696
Harvey, just in case,
I wanna tell you something, okay?

1230
01:35:16,863 --> 01:35:18,656
Don 't think like that. They're coming.

1231
01:35:18,823 --> 01:35:21,117
I know they are,
but I don't want them to.

1232
01:35:25,538 --> 01:35:29,626
I don't wanna live without you,
and I do have an answer for you.

1233
01:35:30,043 --> 01:35:31,794
My answer is yes.

1234
01:35:34,547 --> 01:35:37,300
No! No! No!

1235
01:35:37,467 --> 01:35:40,094
Not me! Why are you coming for me?

1236
01:35:40,261 --> 01:35:41,304
No!

1237
01:35:42,972 --> 01:35:44,557
Rachel! Rachel!

1238
01:35:44,766 --> 01:35:47,101
- Harvey.
- No! No! Rachel!

1239
01:35:47,268 --> 01:35:48,311
Okay.

1240
01:35:48,478 --> 01:35:49,562
Rachel!

1241
01:35:49,979 --> 01:35:51,522
No! No!

1242
01:35:51,689 --> 01:35:55,818
Harvey, it's okay. It's all right. Listen.

1243
01:35:55,985 --> 01:35:57,320
Somewh...

1244
01:36:03,201 --> 01:36:04,410
RAMIREZ:
No, commissioner!

1245
01:36:04,577 --> 01:36:07,247
Rachel! No!

1246
01:36:21,594 --> 01:36:22,720
Hello there.

1247
01:36:28,601 --> 01:36:32,105
SERGEANT:
Back at the MCU, the Joker's gone.

1248
01:36:33,022 --> 01:36:34,732
With Lau?

1249
01:36:37,527 --> 01:36:40,113
The Joker planned to be caught.

1250
01:36:40,446 --> 01:36:42,615
He wanted me to lock him up
in the MCU.

1251
01:37:02,260 --> 01:37:04,304
RACHEL:
Dear Bruce:

1252
01:37:06,055 --> 01:37:08,600
I need to be honest and clear.

1253
01:37:10,643 --> 01:37:13,187
I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.

1254
01:37:13,354 --> 01:37:17,275
I love him, and I wanna spend
the rest of my life with him.

1255
01:37:17,817 --> 01:37:22,238
When I told you that if Gotham no longer
needed Batman, we could be together...

1256
01:37:22,405 --> 01:37:24,616
...I meant it.

1257
01:37:24,866 --> 01:37:29,621
But now I'm sure the day won 't come
when you no longer need Batman.

1258
01:37:30,663 --> 01:37:32,582
I hope it does.

1259
01:37:32,749 --> 01:37:35,501
And if it does, I will be there...

1260
01:37:36,044 --> 01:37:37,462
...but as your friend.

1261
01:37:38,171 --> 01:37:40,423
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1262
01:37:40,590 --> 01:37:42,967
RACHEL:
I'm sorry to let you down.

1263
01:37:43,134 --> 01:37:48,139
If you lose your faith in me,
please keep your faith in people.

1264
01:37:48,723 --> 01:37:53,144
Love, now and always, Rachel.

1265
01:38:01,110 --> 01:38:03,446
ALFRED:
Prepared a little breakfast.

1266
01:38:07,575 --> 01:38:09,494
- Very well, then.
- Alfred.

1267
01:38:09,661 --> 01:38:10,828
Yes, Master Wayne?

1268
01:38:12,205 --> 01:38:14,457
Did I bring this on her?

1269
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:17,710
I was meant to inspire good...

1270
01:38:17,877 --> 01:38:20,255
...not madness, not death.

1271
01:38:20,421 --> 01:38:25,051
You have inspired good. But you spat
in the faces of Gotham's criminals.

1272
01:38:25,218 --> 01:38:27,303
Didn't you think
there might be casualties?

1273
01:38:27,470 --> 01:38:29,889
Things always get worse
before they get better.

1274
01:38:30,223 --> 01:38:31,683
But Rachel, Alfred.

1275
01:38:31,849 --> 01:38:35,645
Rachel believed in what you stood for...

1276
01:38:35,812 --> 01:38:37,730
...what we stand for.

1277
01:38:37,897 --> 01:38:39,357
Gotham needs you.

1278
01:38:39,899 --> 01:38:42,860
No, Gotham needs its true hero...

1279
01:38:43,361 --> 01:38:47,490
...and I let that murdering psychopath
blow him half to hell.

1280
01:38:47,657 --> 01:38:49,993
Which is why, for now...

1281
01:38:50,785 --> 01:38:52,704
...they're gonna have to
make do with you.

1282
01:38:54,914 --> 01:38:56,749
She was gonna wait for me, Alfred.

1283
01:38:58,751 --> 01:39:00,795
Dent doesn't know.

1284
01:39:00,962 --> 01:39:02,255
He can never know.

1285
01:39:04,674 --> 01:39:06,301
What's that?

1286
01:39:06,467 --> 01:39:09,429
- It can wait.
- That bandit...

1287
01:39:09,888 --> 01:39:12,015
...in the forest in Burma.

1288
01:39:12,181 --> 01:39:14,225
- Did you catch him?
- Yes.

1289
01:39:14,392 --> 01:39:15,727
How?

1290
01:39:17,145 --> 01:39:18,771
We burned the forest down.

1291
01:39:58,019 --> 01:40:00,647
He's credible, an M & A lawyer
from a leading consultancy.

1292
01:40:00,813 --> 01:40:04,192
He says he's waited as long as he can
for Batman to do the right thing.

1293
01:40:04,359 --> 01:40:06,444
Now he's taking matters
into his own hands.

1294
01:40:06,611 --> 01:40:09,572
We'll be live at 5 with
the true identity of the Batman.

1295
01:40:26,005 --> 01:40:27,632
I'm sorry about Rachel.

1296
01:40:30,343 --> 01:40:35,181
The doctor says you're in agonizing pain,
but that you won't accept medication.

1297
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:38,184
That you're refusing to...

1298
01:40:38,351 --> 01:40:40,103
...accept skin grafts.

1299
01:40:40,436 --> 01:40:42,689
Remember that name...

1300
01:40:43,273 --> 01:40:45,608
...you all had for me...

1301
01:40:46,067 --> 01:40:48,903
...when I was at Internal Affairs?

1302
01:40:51,364 --> 01:40:52,657
What was it, Gordon?

1303
01:40:53,324 --> 01:40:54,701
Harvey, I...

1304
01:40:54,867 --> 01:40:56,369
Say it.

1305
01:40:57,787 --> 01:40:59,706
Say it!

1306
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:10,466
Two-Face. Harvey Two-Face.

1307
01:41:12,051 --> 01:41:16,347
Why should I hide who I am?

1308
01:41:17,557 --> 01:41:18,892
I know you tried to warn me.

1309
01:41:19,767 --> 01:41:20,977
I'm sorry.

1310
01:41:21,603 --> 01:41:24,230
Wuertz picked you up.
Was he working for them?

1311
01:41:26,524 --> 01:41:28,902
Do you know who picked up Rachel?

1312
01:41:29,736 --> 01:41:32,739
Harvey, I need to know
which of my men I can trust.

1313
01:41:33,114 --> 01:41:35,241
Why would you listen to me now?

1314
01:41:36,367 --> 01:41:38,036
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1315
01:41:40,580 --> 01:41:42,373
No.

1316
01:41:42,832 --> 01:41:44,959
No, you're not.

1317
01:41:46,002 --> 01:41:47,253
Not yet.

1318
01:41:52,508 --> 01:41:55,220
This craziness, it's too much.

1319
01:41:55,428 --> 01:41:58,681
Should've thought about that
before you let the clown out of the box.

1320
01:41:58,848 --> 01:42:00,600
MARONl:
You want him?

1321
01:42:03,061 --> 01:42:05,396
I can tell you
where he'll be this afternoon.

1322
01:42:13,446 --> 01:42:15,740
CHECHEN:
Not so crazy as you look.

1323
01:42:15,907 --> 01:42:19,661
I told you, I'm a man of my word.

1324
01:42:22,872 --> 01:42:24,123
Where is the Italian?

1325
01:42:24,290 --> 01:42:27,418
All tactical units will converge
on the location in 20 minutes.

1326
01:42:27,585 --> 01:42:31,047
I want auxiliary units to cover
all possible getaway routes.

1327
01:42:31,631 --> 01:42:32,799
CHECHEN:
Please.

1328
01:42:32,966 --> 01:42:36,302
Joker-man, what you do
with all your money?

1329
01:42:36,970 --> 01:42:39,639
You see, I'm a guy of simple taste.

1330
01:42:39,806 --> 01:42:41,474
I enjoy...

1331
01:42:41,641 --> 01:42:43,017
...dynamite...

1332
01:42:43,184 --> 01:42:44,727
...and gunpowder...

1333
01:42:45,186 --> 01:42:47,605
...and gasoline.

1334
01:42:49,065 --> 01:42:51,317
- What the...?
- Ah, ah, ah.

1335
01:42:53,152 --> 01:42:55,989
And you know the thing
that they have in common?

1336
01:42:56,489 --> 01:42:57,782
They're cheap.

1337
01:42:57,949 --> 01:43:00,618
CALLER 1 [ON TV]: How much are they
paying you to say who Batman is?

1338
01:43:00,785 --> 01:43:04,747
This is our chance. I want Lau alive.
The Joker, either way.

1339
01:43:04,914 --> 01:43:06,332
Hey, Jim. Get a load of this.

1340
01:43:06,499 --> 01:43:07,834
ENGEL:
Let's take the next caller.

1341
01:43:08,001 --> 01:43:10,169
CALLER 2: Harvey Dent didn 't wanna
give in to this maniac.

1342
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:11,629
You think you know better?

1343
01:43:11,796 --> 01:43:15,174
I think that if we could talk to Dent
today, he may feel differently.

1344
01:43:15,341 --> 01:43:19,429
And we wish him a speedy recovery.
Because God knows, we need him now.

1345
01:43:19,596 --> 01:43:21,806
You said you were a man of your word.

1346
01:43:22,098 --> 01:43:24,142
Oh, I am.

1347
01:43:25,852 --> 01:43:28,521
I'm only burning my half.

1348
01:43:29,856 --> 01:43:31,983
All you care about is money.

1349
01:43:32,150 --> 01:43:35,612
This town deserves
a better class of criminal...

1350
01:43:35,778 --> 01:43:38,031
...and I'm gonna give it to them.

1351
01:43:38,823 --> 01:43:41,326
Tell your men they work for me now.

1352
01:43:41,492 --> 01:43:43,870
This is my city.

1353
01:43:44,537 --> 01:43:47,081
They won't work for a freak.

1354
01:43:47,248 --> 01:43:48,958
[IMITATES CHECHEN]
"Freak."

1355
01:43:49,125 --> 01:43:51,586
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Why don't we
cut you up into little pieces...

1356
01:43:51,753 --> 01:43:53,213
...and feed you to your pooches? Hm?

1357
01:43:53,379 --> 01:43:56,257
And then we'll see how loyal
a hungry dog really is.

1358
01:43:58,259 --> 01:44:00,595
It's not about money...

1359
01:44:00,762 --> 01:44:03,973
...it's about sending a message.

1360
01:44:04,766 --> 01:44:07,227
Everything burns.

1361
01:44:09,729 --> 01:44:11,898
- Who is this?
JOKER: I had a vision...

1362
01:44:12,065 --> 01:44:14,817
...of a world without Batman.

1363
01:44:14,984 --> 01:44:17,237
The Mob ground out a little profit...

1364
01:44:17,403 --> 01:44:21,324
...and the police tried to shut them down
one block at a time.

1365
01:44:21,491 --> 01:44:24,786
And it was so boring.

1366
01:44:24,953 --> 01:44:26,913
I've had a change of heart.

1367
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:29,707
I don 't want Mr. Reese
spoiling everything...

1368
01:44:29,874 --> 01:44:34,587
...but why should I have all the fun?
Let's give someone else a chance.

1369
01:44:34,754 --> 01:44:39,592
If Coleman Reese
isn 't dead in 60 minutes...

1370
01:44:39,759 --> 01:44:41,844
...then I blow up a hospital.

1371
01:44:42,011 --> 01:44:43,596
Call in every officer.

1372
01:44:43,763 --> 01:44:47,100
Tell them to head to their nearest
hospital and start evac and search.

1373
01:44:47,267 --> 01:44:49,394
Call the transit authority,
school board, prisons.

1374
01:44:49,561 --> 01:44:51,187
Get every bus down to a hospital.

1375
01:44:51,354 --> 01:44:55,942
The priority is Gotham General. Wheel
everybody out of that place right now.

1376
01:44:56,109 --> 01:44:57,777
You, you and you, you come with me.

1377
01:44:57,944 --> 01:44:59,821
- Where are we going, sir?
- To get Reese.

1378
01:45:00,154 --> 01:45:03,241
I need you plugged in, checking
Gordon's men and their families.

1379
01:45:03,408 --> 01:45:05,618
- Looking for?
- Hospital admissions.

Will you be wanting the Batpod?

1381
01:45:07,620 --> 01:45:09,581
In the middle of the day?
Not very subtle.

1382
01:45:09,747 --> 01:45:11,040
The Lamborghini, then.

1383
01:45:11,958 --> 01:45:13,084
Much more subtle.

1384
01:45:26,931 --> 01:45:29,434
Excuse me. Let me through.
Excuse me. Okay.

1385
01:45:29,601 --> 01:45:33,104
Sir, could you help, please?

1386
01:45:33,271 --> 01:45:34,981
I'm gonna find a bus for him.

Sir? Commissioner, do you really think...

1388
01:45:38,985 --> 01:45:41,154
...an ordinary citizen
would try to kill this man?

1389
01:45:45,658 --> 01:45:47,994
ENGEL:
Sir. Commissioner.

1390
01:45:50,079 --> 01:45:52,290
Get the cars around the back!

1391
01:45:54,667 --> 01:45:56,002
Go. Keep rolling, Sam.

1392
01:46:01,966 --> 01:46:03,927
I see O'Brien and Richards.

1393
01:46:04,510 --> 01:46:08,014
No immediate family member
admitted to a Gotham hospital.

1394
01:46:09,307 --> 01:46:12,852
REESE: They're trying to kill me.
- Well, maybe Batman can save you.

1395
01:46:25,990 --> 01:46:28,618
Davis, they got space. Bring him out.

1396
01:46:30,286 --> 01:46:32,080
Davis.

1397
01:46:37,210 --> 01:46:39,546
I saw Burns and Zachary.

1398
01:46:39,712 --> 01:46:40,922
ALFRED:
Nothing on them.

1399
01:46:41,089 --> 01:46:42,549
And a patrolman I don't know.

1400
01:46:43,758 --> 01:46:45,677
REESE:
Okay, so, what now?

1401
01:46:46,553 --> 01:46:48,805
What do we do now?
Where are we going?

1402
01:46:51,558 --> 01:46:53,226
Send the information to Gordon.

1403
01:47:01,109 --> 01:47:02,652
Get out of here.

1404
01:47:04,696 --> 01:47:06,489
Davis.

1405
01:47:09,659 --> 01:47:12,078
Ma'am, we're gonna have to
move him now.

1406
01:47:23,756 --> 01:47:26,092
GORDON: It's Berg, isn't it?
- Commissioner.

1407
01:47:27,218 --> 01:47:28,678
You okay, son?

1408
01:47:46,696 --> 01:47:48,281
Hi.

1409
01:47:53,119 --> 01:47:54,621
You know...

1410
01:47:55,455 --> 01:47:58,541
...I don't want there to be
any hard feelings between us, Harvey.

1411
01:47:58,708 --> 01:48:01,836
- When you and...
- Rachel!

1412
01:48:02,003 --> 01:48:04,297
- Rachel were being abducted...

1413
01:48:04,464 --> 01:48:07,467
...I was sitting in Gordon's cage.

1414
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:09,719
I didn't rig those charges.

1415
01:48:09,928 --> 01:48:12,388
Your men, your plan.

1416
01:48:12,597 --> 01:48:15,058
Do I really look like a guy with a plan?

1417
01:48:15,475 --> 01:48:18,269
You know what I am?
I'm a dog chasing cars.

1418
01:48:18,895 --> 01:48:21,356
I wouldn't know what to do with one
if I caught it.

1419
01:48:21,522 --> 01:48:24,651
You know? I just do things.

1420
01:48:25,026 --> 01:48:28,738
The Mob has plans. The cops have plans.

1421
01:48:28,905 --> 01:48:31,115
Gordon's got plans.

1422
01:48:31,282 --> 01:48:34,244
You know, they're schemers.

1423
01:48:34,410 --> 01:48:38,164
Schemers trying to control
their little worlds.

1424
01:48:38,331 --> 01:48:39,832
I'm not a schemer.

1425
01:48:39,999 --> 01:48:41,626
I try to show the schemers...

1426
01:48:41,793 --> 01:48:47,090
...how pathetic their attempts
to control things really are.

1427
01:48:48,049 --> 01:48:51,094
So when I say... Ah. Come here.

1428
01:48:51,594 --> 01:48:55,139
When I say that you and your girlfriend
was nothing personal...

1429
01:48:56,683 --> 01:48:58,893
...you'll know that I'm telling the truth.

1430
01:49:01,396 --> 01:49:04,190
- I'm gonna need your weapon.
- What?

1431
01:49:07,944 --> 01:49:09,779
Why? Because my wife's in the hospital?

1432
01:49:10,488 --> 01:49:12,031
Yeah, that'd be why.

1433
01:49:12,949 --> 01:49:16,160
It's the schemers
that put you where you are.

1434
01:49:16,327 --> 01:49:20,123
You were a schemer, you had plans...

1435
01:49:20,290 --> 01:49:22,458
...and look where that got you.

1436
01:49:33,219 --> 01:49:35,597
ANNOUNCER [OVER RADIO]:
Police are taking every precaution...

1437
01:49:35,763 --> 01:49:37,891
...urging people not to
take matters into their hands.

1438
01:49:38,057 --> 01:49:40,602
I just did what I do best.

1439
01:49:40,768 --> 01:49:44,397
I took your little plan
and I turned it on itself.

1440
01:49:44,564 --> 01:49:49,903
Look what I did to this city with a few
drums of gas and a couple of bullets.

1441
01:49:50,069 --> 01:49:53,364
Hm? You know what I noticed?

1442
01:49:53,531 --> 01:49:57,076
Nobody panics when
things go "according to plan."

1443
01:49:57,243 --> 01:49:58,912
Even if the plan is horrifying.

1444
01:49:59,537 --> 01:50:04,584
If tomorrow I tell the press that, like,
a gangbanger will get shot...

1445
01:50:04,751 --> 01:50:08,213
...or a truckload of soldiers
will be blowing up...

1446
01:50:08,504 --> 01:50:09,589
...nobody panics.

1447
01:50:10,298 --> 01:50:13,384
Because it's all part of the plan.

1448
01:50:13,551 --> 01:50:18,473
But when I say that
one little old mayor will die...

1449
01:50:18,723 --> 01:50:21,142
...well, then, everyone loses their minds.

1450
01:50:24,562 --> 01:50:27,482
Introduce a little anarchy...

1451
01:50:28,650 --> 01:50:30,902
...upset the established order...

1452
01:50:31,069 --> 01:50:35,615
...and everything becomes chaos.

1453
01:50:37,450 --> 01:50:40,203
I'm an agent of chaos.

1454
01:50:40,578 --> 01:50:42,914
Oh, and you know the thing
about chaos?

1455
01:50:44,958 --> 01:50:46,584
It's fair.

1456
01:50:55,802 --> 01:50:58,972
- You live.
- Mm-hm.

1457
01:50:59,472 --> 01:51:01,099
You die.

1458
01:51:01,307 --> 01:51:03,309
Mmm. Now we're talking.

1459
01:51:12,652 --> 01:51:14,153
Mr. Reese.

1460
01:51:32,338 --> 01:51:34,507
That's Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

1461
01:51:34,674 --> 01:51:37,677
- That was a very brave thing you did.
- Trying to catch the light?

1462
01:51:38,011 --> 01:51:40,847
- You weren't protecting the van?
- Why? Who's in it?

1463
01:51:46,311 --> 01:51:48,396
Don't you think
I should go to the hospital?

1464
01:51:48,563 --> 01:51:51,065
Don't watch a whole lot of news,
do you, Mr. Wayne?

1465
01:52:57,215 --> 01:52:59,050
Southeast.

1466
01:52:59,217 --> 01:53:01,427
It's Gotham General.

1467
01:53:02,178 --> 01:53:03,846
- Did you clear the building?
OFFICER: Yeah.

1468
01:53:06,849 --> 01:53:08,560
GORDON: You must know
how many were inside.

1469
01:53:08,726 --> 01:53:10,103
You have patient lists, roll call.

1470
01:53:10,270 --> 01:53:12,605
Right now we're showing
50 people missing. One bus.

1471
01:53:12,772 --> 01:53:15,942
The other buses were heading off to
hospitals. I guess we missed one.

1472
01:53:16,109 --> 01:53:18,236
What's your guess
about where Harvey Dent is?

1473
01:53:18,403 --> 01:53:22,865
Keep looking. And keep it to yourself.
Anybody asks, we got him out.

1474
01:53:25,451 --> 01:53:27,871
Get me the mayor's office on the line.

1475
01:53:29,038 --> 01:53:30,790
We're gonna need the National Guard.

1476
01:53:30,957 --> 01:53:32,584
REPORTER [ON TV]:
- People are still missing...

1477
01:53:32,750 --> 01:53:33,960
...including GCN's own Mike Engel.

1478
01:53:34,127 --> 01:53:37,380
I'm now being told that we're cutting to
a video GCN has just received.

1479
01:53:37,547 --> 01:53:39,465
I'm Mike Engel for Gotham Tonight.

1480
01:53:39,966 --> 01:53:43,303
"What does it take
to make you people wanna join in?

1481
01:53:43,469 --> 01:53:46,055
You failed to kill the lawyer.
I've gotta get you off the bench...

1482
01:53:46,222 --> 01:53:47,974
...and into the game.
JOKER: Bench. Game.

1483
01:53:50,143 --> 01:53:52,270
ENGEL: Come nightfall, this city is mine.
JOKER: Mine.

1484
01:53:52,437 --> 01:53:55,189
- And anyone left here plays by my rules.
- Rules.

1485
01:53:55,481 --> 01:53:58,818
Mr. Fox? Security is showing
a break-in at the R & D Department.

1486
01:53:58,985 --> 01:54:01,112
If you don 't wanna be in the game...

1487
01:54:01,279 --> 01:54:02,655
...get out now.
- Get out now.

1488
01:54:04,824 --> 01:54:07,785
But the bridge-and-tunnel crowd
are sure in for a surprise.

1489
01:54:08,161 --> 01:54:09,871
Ha-ha, ha-ha."

1490
01:54:43,529 --> 01:54:44,822
REPORTER: Gotham P.D.
Has shut down...

1491
01:54:44,989 --> 01:54:47,450
BARTENDER: Sweet Jesus.
...the area 's bridges and tunnels.

1492
01:54:47,617 --> 01:54:51,037
Shouldn't you be out there,
you know, doing something?

1493
01:54:51,204 --> 01:54:53,164
It's my day off.

1494
01:54:53,790 --> 01:54:55,375
I gotta take a leak.

1495
01:54:55,542 --> 01:54:57,877
Keep an eye out for me, will you?

1496
01:55:03,466 --> 01:55:05,426
Now what?
Need someone to shake it for you?

1497
01:55:05,593 --> 01:55:07,178
DENT:
Hello.

1498
01:55:07,887 --> 01:55:09,389
Dent.

1499
01:55:09,556 --> 01:55:11,766
Jesus. I thought you was dead.

1500
01:55:11,933 --> 01:55:13,601
Half.

1501
01:55:19,649 --> 01:55:21,234
Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?

1502
01:55:21,401 --> 01:55:23,403
- It must've been Maroni's men.
- Shut up!

1503
01:55:25,154 --> 01:55:27,282
Are you telling me
that you're gonna protect...

1504
01:55:27,448 --> 01:55:29,200
...the other traitor in Gordon's unit?

1505
01:55:29,367 --> 01:55:30,827
I don't know, he never told me.

1506
01:55:30,994 --> 01:55:34,622
Listen, Dent, I swear to God, I didn't
know what they were gonna do to you.

1507
01:55:36,165 --> 01:55:37,333
That's funny...

1508
01:55:39,085 --> 01:55:41,838
...because I don't know
what's gonna happen to you either.

1509
01:55:45,967 --> 01:55:47,886
Beautiful, isn't it?

1510
01:55:48,261 --> 01:55:49,929
Beautiful.

1511
01:55:50,471 --> 01:55:51,598
Unethical.

1512
01:55:52,765 --> 01:55:54,309
Dangerous.

1513
01:55:54,517 --> 01:55:58,021
You've turned every cell phone
in Gotham into a microphone.

1514
01:55:58,187 --> 01:56:00,607
BATMAN:
And a high-frequency generator-receiver.

1515
01:56:00,773 --> 01:56:05,862
You took my sonar concept
and applied it to every phone in the city.

1516
01:56:06,029 --> 01:56:10,617
With half the city feeding you sonar,
you can image all of Gotham.

1517
01:56:12,535 --> 01:56:13,912
This is wrong.

1518
01:56:14,078 --> 01:56:16,122
I've gotta find this man, Lucius.

1519
01:56:18,124 --> 01:56:19,417
At what cost?

1520
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:22,378
The database is null-key encrypted.

1521
01:56:22,545 --> 01:56:24,756
It can only be accessed by one person.

1522
01:56:26,090 --> 01:56:28,259
This is too much power for one person.

1523
01:56:28,426 --> 01:56:30,595
That's why I gave it to you.

1524
01:56:31,054 --> 01:56:32,263
Only you can use it.

1525
01:56:32,430 --> 01:56:36,226
Spying on 30 million people
isn't part of my job description.

1526
01:56:38,436 --> 01:56:42,148
This is an audio sample. If he talks
within range of any phone in the city...

1527
01:56:42,315 --> 01:56:44,525
...you can triangulate his position.

1528
01:56:44,984 --> 01:56:47,487
I'll help you this one time.

1529
01:56:47,946 --> 01:56:49,739
But consider this my resignation.

1530
01:56:49,906 --> 01:56:54,494
As long as this machine is
at Wayne Enterprises, I won't be.

1531
01:56:55,245 --> 01:56:57,163
When you're finished...

1532
01:56:57,830 --> 01:56:58,957
...type in your name.

1533
01:57:07,549 --> 01:57:10,635
GORDON: My officers are going over
every inch of the tunnels and bridges...

1534
01:57:10,802 --> 01:57:14,013
...but with the Joker's threat,
they're not an option.

1535
01:57:14,180 --> 01:57:17,016
- And land routes east?
- Backed up for hours.

1536
01:57:17,183 --> 01:57:20,812
Which leaves the ferries
with 30,000 ready to board.

1537
01:57:20,979 --> 01:57:24,023
I wanna use the ferries so I can
get those prisoners off the island.

1538
01:57:24,357 --> 01:57:27,151
The men you put away?
Those aren't people I'm worried about.

1539
01:57:27,318 --> 01:57:29,445
You should be.
Whatever the Joker's planning...

1540
01:57:29,612 --> 01:57:34,117
...it's a good bet Harvey's prisoners are
involved. I wanna get them out of here.

1541
01:57:35,577 --> 01:57:36,786
So where is Harvey?

1542
01:57:37,370 --> 01:57:40,540
- We haven't found him.
- Oh, Jesus.

1543
01:57:44,377 --> 01:57:46,462
How long can you keep this quiet?

1544
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:03,229
Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.

1545
01:58:04,063 --> 01:58:06,232
Going to join your wife?

1546
01:58:09,736 --> 01:58:12,238
- You love her?
- Yes.

1547
01:58:13,114 --> 01:58:16,075
You ever imagine what it would be like
to listen to her die?

1548
01:58:16,242 --> 01:58:17,744
Look, take it up with the Joker.

1549
01:58:17,911 --> 01:58:21,164
He killed your woman. He made you...

1550
01:58:21,331 --> 01:58:22,373
...like this.

1551
01:58:22,749 --> 01:58:25,752
The Joker's just a mad dog.

1552
01:58:25,919 --> 01:58:28,546
I want whoever let him off the leash.

1553
01:58:29,255 --> 01:58:32,592
I took care of Wuertz, but who was
your other man inside Gordon's unit?

1554
01:58:32,759 --> 01:58:35,386
Who picked up Rachel?
Must have been someone she trusted.

1555
01:58:36,596 --> 01:58:38,723
Look, if I tell you...

1556
01:58:38,890 --> 01:58:39,933
...will you let me go?

1557
01:58:40,683 --> 01:58:42,018
Can't hurt your chances.

1558
01:58:44,771 --> 01:58:46,439
It was Ramirez.

1559
01:58:51,861 --> 01:58:55,114
- But you said...
- I said it couldn't hurt your chances.

1560
01:58:58,701 --> 01:59:00,828
You're a lucky man.

1561
01:59:04,290 --> 01:59:06,042
- But he's not.
- Who?

1562
01:59:08,962 --> 01:59:10,380
Your driver.

1563
01:59:23,601 --> 01:59:24,644
GUARDSMAN 1:
Stand back.

1564
01:59:24,811 --> 01:59:27,146
Hey, that ain't right.
We should be on that boat.

1565
01:59:27,313 --> 01:59:29,899
GUARDSMAN 2: You wanna ride across
with them? Be my guest.

1566
01:59:53,131 --> 01:59:54,841
FIRST MATE:
Sir, they've stopped their engines.

1567
01:59:55,008 --> 01:59:56,050
Right, get on the radio.

1568
01:59:56,217 --> 01:59:59,846
Tell them we'll come back and pick
them up once we dump the scumbags.

1569
02:00:00,013 --> 02:00:02,390
Liberty, this is Spirit. Come in.

1570
02:00:04,434 --> 02:00:05,643
CAPTAIN:
What the heck was that?

1571
02:00:07,562 --> 02:00:09,022
MAN:
What the...?

1572
02:00:09,564 --> 02:00:12,859
CAPTAIN [OVER RADIO]: Liberty,
come in, please. This is Spirit. Come in.

1573
02:00:14,485 --> 02:00:16,362
Liberty, we have the same thing.
We've lost both engines.

1574
02:00:16,529 --> 02:00:18,031
- Liberty, come in.
BATMAN: Fox.

1575
02:00:18,197 --> 02:00:20,700
There's something going on
on the ferries.

1576
02:00:21,451 --> 02:00:23,745
Get down to the engine room now.

1577
02:00:24,370 --> 02:00:26,581
MAN:
Hey, buddy, what's happening?

1578
02:00:35,173 --> 02:00:38,635
Captain, we got a hundred barrels
down there rigged to blow. And this.

1579
02:00:51,731 --> 02:00:52,815
CAPTAIN:
Oh, my God.

1580
02:00:52,982 --> 02:00:54,817
FIRST MATE:
Looks like some kind of detonator.

1581
02:00:54,984 --> 02:00:57,862
CAPTAIN: Why would they give us
the detonator to our own bomb?

1582
02:01:00,782 --> 02:01:02,158
JOKER [OVER SPEAKER]:
Tonight, you're all gonna...

1583
02:01:02,325 --> 02:01:04,077
...be a part of a social experiment.

1584
02:01:07,914 --> 02:01:11,751
Through the magic of diesel fuel
and ammonium nitrate...

1585
02:01:11,918 --> 02:01:16,005
...I'm ready right now
to blow you all sky-high.

1586
02:01:16,172 --> 02:01:18,258
Liberty, come in, over.

1587
02:01:19,717 --> 02:01:20,760
It's dead.

1588
02:01:21,094 --> 02:01:25,598
JOKER: If anyone attempts
to get off their boat, you all die.

1589
02:01:25,932 --> 02:01:27,225
FOX:
I'm zeroing in.

1590
02:01:27,392 --> 02:01:31,938
JOKER: Each of you has a remote
to blow up the other boat.

1591
02:01:32,105 --> 02:01:34,566
His voice is on the ferry...

1592
02:01:34,732 --> 02:01:36,776
...but it's not the source.

1593
02:01:39,028 --> 02:01:40,154
West.

1594
02:01:47,412 --> 02:01:49,706
- Gordon.
BATMAN: I have the Joker's location.

1595
02:01:49,873 --> 02:01:50,957
Prewitt Building.

1596
02:01:51,124 --> 02:01:53,585
Assemble on the building opposite.

1597
02:01:54,961 --> 02:01:57,755
At midnight, I blow you all up.

1598
02:01:57,922 --> 02:02:03,094
Lf, however, one of you presses
the button, I'll let that boat live.

1599
02:02:03,261 --> 02:02:05,388
So who 's it gonna be?

1600
02:02:05,555 --> 02:02:08,099
Harvey Dent's most-wanted
scumbag collection...

1601
02:02:08,266 --> 02:02:11,603
...or the sweet and innocent civilians?

1602
02:02:11,769 --> 02:02:14,314
You choose.

1603
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:16,399
Oh, and you might wanna
decide quickly...

1604
02:02:16,566 --> 02:02:20,904
...because the people on the other boat
may not be quite so noble.

1605
02:02:28,286 --> 02:02:29,329
Stay back.

1606
02:02:29,495 --> 02:02:33,291
Well, now, who are you to decide?
We ought to talk this over, at least.

1607
02:02:33,666 --> 02:02:37,253
We don't all have to die.
Those men had their chance.

1608
02:02:37,879 --> 02:02:41,674
- We are not going to talk about this.
- Why aren't we talking about it?

1609
02:02:41,841 --> 02:02:44,427
They're talking over the same thing
on the other boat.

1610
02:02:44,594 --> 02:02:46,888
- Let's put it to a vote.
CROWD: Yes!

1611
02:02:52,185 --> 02:02:54,771
- Hello?
RAMIREZ: Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez.

1612
02:02:54,938 --> 02:02:57,982
Jim needs you to pack up
and put the kids in the car right away.

1613
02:02:58,149 --> 02:02:59,859
But the units outside...

1614
02:03:00,026 --> 02:03:01,611
Those cops can 't be trusted.

1615
02:03:01,778 --> 02:03:04,739
Jim needs you away from them
as soon as possible.

1616
02:03:04,906 --> 02:03:07,867
I'll call them off for 10 minutes,
and you'll have to move fast.

1617
02:03:08,034 --> 02:03:11,871
- But where am I supposed to take them?
- 25052nd Street.

1618
02:03:12,038 --> 02:03:13,915
Leave as soon as
the patrol car pulls out.

1619
02:03:14,082 --> 02:03:15,458
Okay.

1620
02:03:15,833 --> 02:03:17,627
She believe you?

1621
02:03:17,835 --> 02:03:19,879
It's because she trusts you...

1622
02:03:20,213 --> 02:03:21,297
...just like Rachel did.

1623
02:03:21,464 --> 02:03:23,550
- I didn't know...
- Didn't know what they'd do?

1624
02:03:23,716 --> 02:03:26,469
You're the second cop to say that to me.

1625
02:03:26,719 --> 02:03:28,846
What exactly did you think
they were gonna do?

1626
02:03:29,013 --> 02:03:31,266
They got me early on.
My mother's hospital bills...

1627
02:03:31,432 --> 02:03:34,477
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.

1628
02:03:35,019 --> 02:03:37,480
You live to fight another day, officer.

1629
02:03:41,276 --> 02:03:43,111
SWAT LEADER:
We found the missing hospital bus.

1630
02:03:43,278 --> 02:03:44,988
GORDON:
Then we have a hostage situation.

1631
02:03:47,073 --> 02:03:49,075
It's a shooting gallery.

1632
02:03:49,450 --> 02:03:51,744
Why would he choose a spot
with such big windows?

1633
02:03:51,911 --> 02:03:53,746
SWAT LEADER:
We have clear shots on five clowns.

1634
02:03:53,913 --> 02:03:56,666
Snipers take them out,
smash the windows, a team rappels in.

1635
02:03:57,083 --> 02:03:58,585
Team moves in by the stairwells.

1636
02:03:58,751 --> 02:04:00,879
Two, three casualties max.

1637
02:04:01,045 --> 02:04:02,922
- Let's do it.
BATMAN: It's not that simple.

1638
02:04:03,089 --> 02:04:05,425
- With the Joker, it never is.
- What's simple is...

1639
02:04:05,592 --> 02:04:08,761
...every second, those people on
the ferries get closer to blowing...

1640
02:04:08,928 --> 02:04:11,472
- That won't happen.
- Then he'll blow both of them up!

1641
02:04:11,639 --> 02:04:15,393
- We don't have time for paper ballots.
- I want everybody to put their votes...

1642
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:17,562
...on this piece of paper.

1643
02:04:18,605 --> 02:04:21,441
If anyone's got pens, pass it along.

1644
02:04:21,774 --> 02:04:23,568
GUARDSMAN: Thank you.
Anybody else?

1645
02:04:23,735 --> 02:04:25,570
Coming through. Anybody else?
Thank you.

1646
02:04:25,737 --> 02:04:28,615
COMMANDER:
We need to get these votes in quickly.

1647
02:04:28,781 --> 02:04:30,325
Come on.

1648
02:04:32,327 --> 02:04:34,454
PRISONER 1: What are you waiting for?
Push the button!

1649
02:04:34,621 --> 02:04:36,581
PRISONER 2:
We're running out of time!

1650
02:04:37,874 --> 02:04:39,709
I need five minutes alone.

1651
02:04:39,876 --> 02:04:41,711
No! There's no time!

1652
02:04:41,878 --> 02:04:43,296
We have clear shots!

1653
02:04:43,463 --> 02:04:46,382
Dent is in there with them.
We have to save Dent!

1654
02:04:46,549 --> 02:04:48,509
I have to save Dent.

1655
02:04:48,676 --> 02:04:49,802
Get ready.

1656
02:04:52,639 --> 02:04:55,308
Two minutes, then we breach.

1657
02:05:00,897 --> 02:05:02,398
Fox, I need picture.

1658
02:05:05,443 --> 02:05:07,904
- Hello?
BARBARA: Jim, we're in trouble.

1659
02:05:09,155 --> 02:05:11,449
FOX:
Okay, you got POV on alpha...

1660
02:05:12,492 --> 02:05:14,452
...omni on beta.

1661
02:05:15,912 --> 02:05:19,290
Looks like clowns and hostages
on two floors.

1662
02:05:19,457 --> 02:05:21,876
There's a SWA T team on the stairwell.

1663
02:05:25,171 --> 02:05:27,799
Another SWA T team on the roof.

1664
02:05:29,342 --> 02:05:30,552
TEAM LEADER:
Line's clear.

1665
02:05:32,303 --> 02:05:35,014
- Barbara, calm down.
- He has the kids!

1666
02:05:35,181 --> 02:05:38,434
DENT: Hello, Jim.
- Harvey?

1667
02:05:39,227 --> 02:05:42,438
- Where's my family?
- Where my family died.

1668
02:05:45,525 --> 02:05:47,193
SWAT LEADER:
Blue team, acquire the target.

1669
02:05:48,861 --> 02:05:51,447
Entry team, set your charge.

1670
02:06:07,380 --> 02:06:09,215
BATMAN: Fox, the SWA Ts are
targeting the wrong people.

1671
02:06:09,382 --> 02:06:10,884
The clowns are the hostages.

1672
02:06:11,593 --> 02:06:13,386
Red team, go! Red team, go!

1673
02:06:17,140 --> 02:06:18,558
Entry team, blow and go!

1674
02:06:22,645 --> 02:06:24,063
Don't move.

1675
02:06:25,231 --> 02:06:26,608
SWAT LEADER:
Take the shot.

1676
02:06:32,238 --> 02:06:33,907
FOX:
Those SWA Ts are coming in hot.

1677
02:06:34,073 --> 02:06:35,909
SWAT 1:
Clowns, put down your guns.

1678
02:06:36,409 --> 02:06:39,037
SWAT 2: Drop your weapons!
SWAT 3: On the ground, now!

1679
02:06:39,245 --> 02:06:42,415
SWAT 4: Doctors, get down!
Clear the line of fire. Drop your weap...

1680
02:07:07,023 --> 02:07:08,191
SWAT 5:
Freeze!

1681
02:07:08,358 --> 02:07:10,735
Stand down or you will be...

1682
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:15,740
FOX:
Look up.

1683
02:07:16,324 --> 02:07:18,910
See those bad guys on the floor above?

1684
02:07:19,077 --> 02:07:22,080
They're waiting to ambush
the SWA T team coming up the elevator.

1685
02:07:22,539 --> 02:07:23,581
SWAT LEADER:
Sixty seconds.

1686
02:07:31,881 --> 02:07:36,469
The tally is 140 against, 396 for.

1687
02:07:44,602 --> 02:07:47,146
So go ahead. Do it.

1688
02:07:47,313 --> 02:07:49,315
We're still here.

1689
02:07:50,483 --> 02:07:53,444
And that means they haven't
killed us yet either.

1690
02:07:54,904 --> 02:07:56,656
TEAM LEADER:
Go, go, go!

1691
02:07:56,823 --> 02:07:58,616
Blue team, cover!

1692
02:08:01,578 --> 02:08:02,620
Uh-oh.

1693
02:08:04,122 --> 02:08:05,790
FOX:
Trouble on the floor above.

1694
02:08:15,133 --> 02:08:16,509
SWAT 6:
Get down on the ground now!

1695
02:08:24,934 --> 02:08:27,353
SWAT 7:
Freeze! Stop or we will shoot.

1696
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:29,522
SWAT 8:
We will shoot you. Drop the officer.

1697
02:08:29,689 --> 02:08:31,232
Release the officer right now.

1698
02:08:31,399 --> 02:08:33,359
SWAT 9: Let him go now!
On your knees!

1699
02:08:33,943 --> 02:08:36,029
PILOT:
We got him. He's out of the game.

1700
02:08:36,196 --> 02:08:38,698
SWAT 9: Keep your hands in the air!
SWAT 8: Step away from the edge!

1701
02:08:46,748 --> 02:08:48,374
SWAT 10:
Halt!

1702
02:09:01,679 --> 02:09:03,056
SWAT 11: Stay down!
SWAT 12: Don't move!

1703
02:09:03,223 --> 02:09:07,518
SWAT LEADER: Be advised. Clowns
are hostages, doctors are targets.

1704
02:09:13,816 --> 02:09:15,985
Ah, you made it. I'm so thrilled.

1705
02:09:16,152 --> 02:09:19,322
- Where's the detonator?
- Go get him.

1706
02:09:32,710 --> 02:09:35,797
SWAT 13: Put down your weapon!
SWAT 14: Don't move!

1707
02:10:07,203 --> 02:10:09,080
You don't wanna die...

1708
02:10:09,247 --> 02:10:12,292
...but you don't know how to take a life.

1709
02:10:12,458 --> 02:10:14,127
Give it to me.

1710
02:10:14,419 --> 02:10:18,756
These men will kill you
and take it anyway.

1711
02:10:22,176 --> 02:10:24,679
No one wants to get their hands dirty.

1712
02:10:24,846 --> 02:10:27,807
Fine. I'll do it.

1713
02:10:29,475 --> 02:10:32,186
Those men on that boat?
They made their choices.

1714
02:10:32,353 --> 02:10:34,647
They chose to murder and steal.

1715
02:10:34,814 --> 02:10:38,026
It doesn't make any sense
for us to have to die too.

1716
02:10:47,493 --> 02:10:49,954
All the old familiar places.

1717
02:10:56,252 --> 02:10:57,337
FOX:
Stand by.

1718
02:11:07,680 --> 02:11:11,267
SWAT 2: Red team, floor secure.
Hostages are safe.

1719
02:11:11,476 --> 02:11:13,561
Give it to me.

1720
02:11:14,979 --> 02:11:18,733
You can tell them I took it by force.

1721
02:11:19,234 --> 02:11:24,155
Give it to me, and I'll do what
you should've did 10 minutes ago.

1722
02:11:46,219 --> 02:11:49,556
We really should stop this fighting,
otherwise we'll miss the fireworks.

1723
02:11:49,722 --> 02:11:51,558
There won't be any fireworks.

1724
02:11:51,975 --> 02:11:55,186
And here we go.

1725
02:12:34,517 --> 02:12:36,436
What were you trying to prove?

1726
02:12:36,603 --> 02:12:39,564
That deep down,
everyone's as ugly as you?

1727
02:12:40,690 --> 02:12:41,733
You're alone.

1728
02:12:48,323 --> 02:12:53,828
Can't rely on anyone these days. You
gotta do everything yourself. Don't we?

1729
02:12:54,037 --> 02:12:56,873
That's okay. I came prepared.

1730
02:12:57,081 --> 02:13:01,544
It's a funny world we live in. Speaking of
which, you know how I got these scars?

1731
02:13:01,711 --> 02:13:04,547
No, but I know how you got these.

1732
02:13:22,357 --> 02:13:25,109
Oh, you.

1733
02:13:25,276 --> 02:13:28,321
You just couldn't let me go, could you?

1734
02:13:29,447 --> 02:13:33,368
This is what happens
when an unstoppable force...

1735
02:13:33,535 --> 02:13:37,997
...meets an immovable object.

1736
02:13:38,581 --> 02:13:44,003
You truly are incorruptible, aren't you?

1737
02:13:44,170 --> 02:13:46,881
Huh? You won't kill me...

1738
02:13:47,048 --> 02:13:53,304
...out of some misplaced sense
of self-righteousness.

1739
02:13:53,471 --> 02:13:56,683
And I won't kill you...

1740
02:13:56,849 --> 02:14:00,645
...because you're just too much fun.

1741
02:14:01,688 --> 02:14:05,858
I think you and I are destined
to do this forever.

1742
02:14:06,025 --> 02:14:08,027
You'll be in a padded cell forever.

1743
02:14:08,194 --> 02:14:10,029
Maybe we could share one.

1744
02:14:10,196 --> 02:14:11,656
You know,
they'll be doubling up...

1745
02:14:11,823 --> 02:14:14,367
...the rate this city's inhabitants
are losing their minds.

1746
02:14:14,534 --> 02:14:17,662
This city just showed you...

1747
02:14:17,829 --> 02:14:21,875
...that it's full of people
ready to believe in good.

1748
02:14:22,041 --> 02:14:25,211
Until their spirit breaks completely.

1749
02:14:26,087 --> 02:14:30,925
Until they get a good look
at the real Harvey Dent...

1750
02:14:31,092 --> 02:14:33,887
...and all the heroic things he's done.

1751
02:14:35,555 --> 02:14:40,602
You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle
for Gotham's soul...

1752
02:14:40,768 --> 02:14:43,688
...in a fistfight with you?

1753
02:14:44,230 --> 02:14:45,773
No.

1754
02:14:45,940 --> 02:14:49,360
You need an ace in the hole.

1755
02:14:49,527 --> 02:14:51,154
Mine's Harvey.

1756
02:14:51,529 --> 02:14:53,239
What did you do?

1757
02:14:53,406 --> 02:14:56,409
I took Gotham's white knight...

1758
02:14:56,576 --> 02:15:00,205
...and I brought him down to our level.

1759
02:15:00,622 --> 02:15:03,583
It wasn't hard.
See, madness, as you know...

1760
02:15:03,750 --> 02:15:06,794
...is like gravity.

1761
02:15:06,961 --> 02:15:09,297
All it takes is a little push.

1762
02:15:26,231 --> 02:15:27,982
Dent!

1763
02:15:48,962 --> 02:15:53,299
DENT: This is where they brought her,
Gordon, after your men handed her over.

1764
02:15:54,050 --> 02:15:55,635
This is where she died.

1765
02:15:55,802 --> 02:15:58,137
I know, I was here...

1766
02:15:59,180 --> 02:16:01,933
...trying to save her.
- But you didn't.

1767
02:16:02,225 --> 02:16:03,977
- I couldn't.
- Yes, you could've.

1768
02:16:04,143 --> 02:16:05,645
If you'd listened to me.

1769
02:16:05,812 --> 02:16:08,439
If you stood up against corruption...

1770
02:16:08,606 --> 02:16:10,817
...instead of doing your deal
with the devil.

1771
02:16:10,984 --> 02:16:12,610
I was trying to fight the Mob!

1772
02:16:13,111 --> 02:16:17,949
You wouldn't dare try to justify yourself
if you knew what I'd lost.

1773
02:16:19,242 --> 02:16:22,370
Have you ever had to talk to the person
you loved most...

1774
02:16:22,537 --> 02:16:26,416
...tell them it's gonna be all right,
when you know it's not?

1775
02:16:28,084 --> 02:16:31,963
Well, you're about to know
what that feels like, Gordon.

1776
02:16:32,714 --> 02:16:36,593
Then you can look me in the eye
and tell me you're sorry.

1777
02:16:38,344 --> 02:16:41,931
- You're not going to hurt my family.
- No.

1778
02:16:42,098 --> 02:16:44,809
Just the person you love most.

1779
02:16:52,817 --> 02:16:55,862
So is it your wife?

1780
02:16:56,946 --> 02:16:58,615
Put the gun down, Harvey.

1781
02:16:58,990 --> 02:17:00,658
Harvey, put down the gun.

1782
02:17:00,825 --> 02:17:04,370
Please. Please, Harvey. Please.

1783
02:17:05,747 --> 02:17:07,040
Oh, goddamn it.

1784
02:17:07,207 --> 02:17:09,375
Will you stop pointing that gun
at my family?

1785
02:17:09,876 --> 02:17:11,544
BARBARA: No!
- We have a winner.

1786
02:17:11,711 --> 02:17:13,213
No, Jim, stop him!

1787
02:17:13,713 --> 02:17:15,548
GORDON: Harvey.
BARBARA: Don't let him...

1788
02:17:15,715 --> 02:17:16,841
Harvey!

1789
02:17:18,218 --> 02:17:20,094
I'm sorry!

1790
02:17:21,888 --> 02:17:22,972
For everything.

1791
02:17:25,558 --> 02:17:27,769
Please don't hurt my son.

1792
02:17:37,904 --> 02:17:39,489
You brought your cops?

1793
02:17:39,656 --> 02:17:42,534
All they know is there's a situation.

1794
02:17:42,700 --> 02:17:45,703
They don't know who or what.
They're just creating a perimeter.

1795
02:17:45,870 --> 02:17:48,540
You think I wanna escape from this?

1796
02:17:48,706 --> 02:17:51,459
There is no escape from this.

1797
02:17:51,626 --> 02:17:53,753
You don't wanna hurt the boy, Harvey.

1798
02:17:56,047 --> 02:17:59,259
It's not about what I want,
it's about what's fair!

1799
02:18:00,009 --> 02:18:04,222
You thought we could be decent men
in an indecent time.

1800
02:18:07,016 --> 02:18:08,101
But you were wrong.

1801
02:18:08,810 --> 02:18:12,605
The world is cruel. And the only morality
in a cruel world...

1802
02:18:13,356 --> 02:18:15,275
...is chance.

1803
02:18:15,441 --> 02:18:17,151
Unbiased.

1804
02:18:17,360 --> 02:18:18,611
Unprejudiced.

1805
02:18:19,988 --> 02:18:21,114
Fair.

1806
02:18:21,281 --> 02:18:23,533
His son's got the same chance she had.

1807
02:18:24,284 --> 02:18:25,577
Fifty-fifty.

1808
02:18:25,743 --> 02:18:29,205
What happened to Rachel wasn't
chance. We decided to act.

1809
02:18:29,539 --> 02:18:30,874
We three.

1810
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:34,460
Then why was it me who was
the only one who lost everything?

1811
02:18:36,963 --> 02:18:39,591
- It wasn't.
- The Joker chose me.

1812
02:18:39,757 --> 02:18:42,051
Because you were the best of us.

1813
02:18:42,218 --> 02:18:47,223
He wanted to prove that
even someone as good as you...

1814
02:18:47,390 --> 02:18:49,142
...could fall.

1815
02:18:49,475 --> 02:18:50,768
And he was right.

1816
02:18:50,935 --> 02:18:53,187
You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey.

1817
02:18:53,354 --> 02:18:56,399
So point it at the people responsible.

1818
02:18:57,358 --> 02:18:59,194
Fair enough.

1819
02:19:02,530 --> 02:19:04,407
You first.

1820
02:19:16,920 --> 02:19:18,588
My turn.

1821
02:19:25,511 --> 02:19:27,513
Harvey, you're right.

1822
02:19:28,556 --> 02:19:31,184
Rachel's death was my fault.

1823
02:19:34,270 --> 02:19:36,731
Please don't punish the boy.

1824
02:19:37,815 --> 02:19:41,027
- Please, punish me.
- I'm about to.

1825
02:19:42,987 --> 02:19:44,948
Tell your boy
he's gonna be all right, Gordon.

1826
02:19:45,406 --> 02:19:47,033
Lie...

1827
02:19:47,534 --> 02:19:48,660
...like I lied.

1828
02:19:52,413 --> 02:19:53,998
It's going to be all right, son.

1829
02:20:32,412 --> 02:20:35,248
Dad? Daddy, is he okay?

1830
02:20:51,764 --> 02:20:53,933
- Thank you.
- You don't have to thank me.

1831
02:20:54,559 --> 02:20:56,352
Yes, I do.

1832
02:21:00,607 --> 02:21:01,941
The Joker won.

1833
02:21:04,360 --> 02:21:07,238
Harvey's prosecution,
everything he fought for...

1834
02:21:07,780 --> 02:21:09,532
...undone.

1835
02:21:10,033 --> 02:21:14,954
Whatever chance you gave us at fixing
our city dies with Harvey's reputation.

1836
02:21:15,121 --> 02:21:16,289
We bet it all on him.

1837
02:21:17,624 --> 02:21:20,501
The Joker took the best of us
and tore him down.

1838
02:21:21,085 --> 02:21:22,503
People will lose hope.

1839
02:21:22,670 --> 02:21:24,422
They won't.

1840
02:21:26,925 --> 02:21:28,801
They must never know what he did.

1841
02:21:28,968 --> 02:21:30,803
Five dead.

1842
02:21:31,095 --> 02:21:32,388
Two of them cops.

1843
02:21:32,555 --> 02:21:35,016
- You can't sweep that...
- No.

1844
02:21:39,812 --> 02:21:42,649
But the Joker cannot win.

1845
02:21:47,904 --> 02:21:51,115
Gotham needs its true hero.

1846
02:21:57,497 --> 02:22:00,542
- No.
- You either die a hero...

1847
02:22:00,708 --> 02:22:05,171
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

1848
02:22:05,338 --> 02:22:07,173
I can do those things...

1849
02:22:07,590 --> 02:22:10,635
...because I'm not a hero, not like Dent.

1850
02:22:13,638 --> 02:22:16,516
I killed those people.
That's what I can be.

1851
02:22:16,683 --> 02:22:18,601
No, no, you can't. You're not.

1852
02:22:18,768 --> 02:22:21,354
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.

1853
02:22:23,022 --> 02:22:24,148
Call it in.

1854
02:22:27,443 --> 02:22:29,195
GORDON:
A hero.

1855
02:22:29,362 --> 02:22:32,615
Not the hero we deserved,
but the hero we needed.

1856
02:22:33,199 --> 02:22:35,743
Nothing less than a knight...

1857
02:22:36,286 --> 02:22:37,996
...shining.

1858
02:22:38,621 --> 02:22:40,248
GORDON:
They'll hunt you.

1859
02:22:40,415 --> 02:22:42,208
BATMAN:
You'll hunt me.

1860
02:22:42,709 --> 02:22:44,669
You'll condemn me.

1861
02:22:45,378 --> 02:22:47,672
Set the dogs on me.

1862
02:22:51,426 --> 02:22:53,720
Because that's what needs to happen.

1863
02:22:54,888 --> 02:22:56,806
Because sometimes...

1864
02:22:56,973 --> 02:22:59,142
...the truth isn 't good enough.

1865
02:23:00,018 --> 02:23:02,312
Sometimes people deserve more.

1866
02:23:05,773 --> 02:23:09,694
Sometimes people deserve
to have their faith rewarded.

1867
02:23:28,087 --> 02:23:29,756
JAMES:
Batman.

1868
02:23:31,674 --> 02:23:33,426
Batman!

1869
02:23:34,219 --> 02:23:36,179
Why's he running, Dad?

1870
02:23:37,222 --> 02:23:38,556
Because we have to chase him.

1871
02:23:38,723 --> 02:23:41,601
Okay, we're going in! Go, go! Move!

1872
02:23:47,690 --> 02:23:49,275
He didn't do anything wrong.

1873
02:23:52,028 --> 02:23:57,617
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,
but not the one it needs right now.

1874
02:23:59,035 --> 02:24:00,078
So we'll hunt him...

1875
02:24:03,206 --> 02:24:05,291
...because he can take it.

1876
02:24:07,794 --> 02:24:10,296
Because he's not our hero.

1877
02:24:17,845 --> 02:24:19,055
He's a silent guardian...

1878
02:24:20,223 --> 02:24:22,100
...a watchful protector.

1879
02:24:24,602 --> 02:24:25,895
A dark knight.
