1
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,939
Three of a kind, let's do this.
That's it? Three guys?

2
00:01:48,106 --> 00:01:51,438
Two guys on the roof. Every
guy gets a share. Five shares is plenty.

3
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,064
Six shares. Don't
forget the guy who planned the job.

4
00:01:54,237 --> 00:01:56,524
He thinks he can sit it out
and still take a slice.

5
00:01:56,698 --> 00:01:59,816
- I know why they call him the Joker.
Why do they call him the Joker?

6
00:01:59,993 --> 00:02:01,818
I heard he wears makeup.
Makeup?

7
00:02:01,995 --> 00:02:03,951
Yeah, to scare people.
You know, war paint.

8
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:19,711
All right, everybody,
hands up, heads down!

9
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:22,882
I said, hands up, heads down!

10
00:02:23,057 --> 00:02:26,009
Let's go, pal,
I'm making a withdrawal here.

11
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:27,726
- I said, hands up!
- No!

12
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:30,344
Here comes the silent alarm.

13
00:02:30,523 --> 00:02:31,850
And there it goes.

14
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:33,222
Heads down!

15
00:02:33,401 --> 00:02:35,725
All right, tootsie,
you're taking a dive with me.

16
00:02:35,903 --> 00:02:38,571
- Down! I said, stay down there!
Don't hurt me!

17
00:02:38,823 --> 00:02:41,822
Funny, it didn't dial 911.
It was trying to reach a private number.

18
00:02:41,993 --> 00:02:43,901
Is it a problem?
No, I'm done here.

19
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:55,667
Sit down! Down!

20
00:02:56,173 --> 00:02:58,330
Down! I said, stay down there!

21
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:05,430
Obviously we don't want you
doing anything with your hands...

22
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,515
...other than holding on for dear life.

23
00:03:16,277 --> 00:03:18,268
On the ground! Stay on the ground!

24
00:03:18,445 --> 00:03:22,109
Nobody make a move!
Nobody! Stay down!

25
00:03:38,548 --> 00:03:39,578
Yeah!

26
00:03:42,427 --> 00:03:44,501
You have any idea
who you're stealing from?

27
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,379
- You and your friends are dead.
He's out, right?

28
00:03:51,478 --> 00:03:52,721
What...?

29
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,312
Where did you learn to count?

30
00:04:05,116 --> 00:04:07,154
They wired this thing up
with like 5000 volts.

31
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:08,570
What kind of bank does that?

32
00:04:08,745 --> 00:04:11,780
A Mob bank.
I guess the Joker's as crazy as they say.

33
00:04:11,956 --> 00:04:12,986
Where's the alarm guy?

34
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,655
Boss told me when the guy
was done, I should take him out.

35
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:17,162
One less share, right?

36
00:04:18,087 --> 00:04:20,327
Funny, he told me something similar.

37
00:04:20,506 --> 00:04:21,963
He what? No! No!

38
00:04:33,686 --> 00:04:35,060
That's a lot of money.

39
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:38,928
If this Joker guy was so smart,
he'd have had us bring a bigger car.

40
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:44,272
I'm betting the Joker told you to kill me
soon as we loaded the cash.

41
00:04:45,197 --> 00:04:48,979
No, no, no, I kill the bus driver.

42
00:04:49,702 --> 00:04:50,815
Bus driver?

43
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:54,532
What bus driver?

44
00:04:58,627 --> 00:05:00,535
School's out. Time to go.

45
00:05:00,713 --> 00:05:02,953
That guy's not getting up, is he?

46
00:05:03,716 --> 00:05:05,374
That's a lot of money.

47
00:05:08,887 --> 00:05:11,211
What happened to the rest of the guys?

48
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,351
You think you're smart, huh?

49
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:22,689
The guy that hired youse...

50
00:05:23,235 --> 00:05:25,807
...he'll just do the same to you.

51
00:05:26,113 --> 00:05:29,065
Oh, criminals in this town
used to believe in things.

52
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:30,520
Honor...

53
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:32,407
...respect.

54
00:05:32,577 --> 00:05:34,901
Look at you.
What do you believe in, huh?

55
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,359
What do you believe in?!

56
00:05:36,707 --> 00:05:41,617
I believe whatever doesn't kill you
simply makes you...

57
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:44,754
...stranger.

58
00:06:26,714 --> 00:06:29,630
Mr. Mayor, you were elected
in a campaign to clean up the city.

59
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,957
- When are you gonna start?
I already have.

60
00:06:32,136 --> 00:06:33,214
Like this Batman.

61
00:06:33,387 --> 00:06:35,959
We're hearing he's doing good,
criminals are running scared.

62
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,839
- No, man. I don't like it tonight.
- What are you, superstitious?

63
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:43,102
You got more chance of winning
the Powerball than running into him.

64
00:06:43,272 --> 00:06:46,639
That's not true. Our men in the
Major Crimes Unit are close to an arrest.

65
00:06:46,817 --> 00:06:49,769
Hey, Wuertz, mayor says
you're closing in on the Batman.

66
00:06:49,945 --> 00:06:52,066
The investigation is ongoing.

67
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:54,645
The process of cleaning up
the streets is a long one.

68
00:06:54,825 --> 00:06:56,816
I pledged in my campaign, uh, to have...

69
00:07:01,165 --> 00:07:03,452
Ever intending to see your wife again,
lieutenant?

70
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,293
I thought you had to
go look after your mother, detective.

71
00:07:06,462 --> 00:07:08,418
Checked her back into the hospital.

72
00:07:08,881 --> 00:07:10,504
I'm sorry.

73
00:07:11,008 --> 00:07:14,292
- So he hasn't shown up?
- He often doesn't.

74
00:07:14,678 --> 00:07:16,384
I like reminding everybody
he's out there.

75
00:07:16,555 --> 00:07:17,834
Why wouldn't he come?

76
00:07:18,181 --> 00:07:20,006
Hopefully...

77
00:07:20,517 --> 00:07:22,058
...because he's busy.

78
00:07:38,785 --> 00:07:41,701
That's why we bring dogs.

79
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:44,195
- My little princes.
Please.

80
00:07:44,374 --> 00:07:47,955
Please, they're crawling in my mouth.
Please, I beg you, get them off.

81
00:07:48,128 --> 00:07:50,878
Look what your drugs
do to my customers.

82
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:52,670
Buyer beware.

83
00:07:52,841 --> 00:07:56,043
I told you my compound
would take you places.

84
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:58,969
I never said they'd be places
you wanted to go.

85
00:07:59,138 --> 00:08:01,674
My business, repeat customers.

86
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:03,555
You don't like
what I have to offer...

87
00:08:03,726 --> 00:08:05,468
...you can buy from someone else.

88
00:08:05,645 --> 00:08:08,395
Assuming Batman left anyone
to buy from.

89
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:15,730
My dogs are hungry.

90
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:21,738
Pity there's only one of you.

91
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,368
What...?
That's not him.

92
00:08:35,758 --> 00:08:37,500
Loose the dogs!

93
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,771
That's more like it.

94
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,602
Don't let me find you out here again.

95
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:24,613
- We're trying to help you.
I don't need help.

96
00:10:24,782 --> 00:10:26,109
Not my diagnosis.

97
00:10:26,283 --> 00:10:29,864
What gives you the right? What's
the difference between you and me?

98
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:32,906
I'm not wearing hockey pads.

99
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:38,374
Everybody back now!

100
00:10:40,547 --> 00:10:43,712
He can't resist showing us his face.

101
00:10:47,971 --> 00:10:50,128
What's he hiding under that makeup?

102
00:10:57,856 --> 00:11:00,524
Uh, can we get a minute,
people, please?

103
00:11:03,153 --> 00:11:05,310
Him again. Who are the others?

104
00:11:05,489 --> 00:11:07,065
Another bunch of smalltimers.

105
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,156
Some of the marked bills I gave you.

106
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:12,614
My detectives have been
making drug buys with them.

107
00:11:12,787 --> 00:11:15,359
This bank was another drop for the Mob.
That makes five.

108
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:18,111
- We found the bulk of their dirty cash.
- Time to move in.

109
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:22,074
We'd have to hit all banks
simultaneously. SWAT teams, backup.

110
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:24,079
What about this Joker guy?

111
00:11:24,256 --> 00:11:27,208
One man or the entire Mob? He can wait.

112
00:11:27,384 --> 00:11:29,708
When the new DA hears about this,
he'll want in.

113
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:32,423
- Do you trust him?
- Be hard to keep him out.

114
00:11:32,598 --> 00:11:36,048
I hear he's as stubborn as you are.

115
00:12:19,602 --> 00:12:22,554
Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt.

116
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,433
You can swap
not sleeping in a penthouse...

117
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:27,149
...for not sleeping in a mansion.

118
00:12:27,318 --> 00:12:31,065
Whenever you stitch yourself up,
you do make a bloody mess.

119
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:34,238
Yeah. It makes me learn
from my mistakes.

120
00:12:34,408 --> 00:12:37,822
You ought to be pretty knowledgeable
by now, then.

121
00:12:39,538 --> 00:12:40,568
My armor.

122
00:12:40,748 --> 00:12:44,329
I'm carrying too much weight.
I need to be... I need to be faster.

123
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:47,170
I'm sure Mr. Fox can oblige.

124
00:12:47,338 --> 00:12:49,827
- Did you get mauled by a tiger?
- It was a dog.

125
00:12:50,007 --> 00:12:52,543
- Huh?
- It was a big dog.

126
00:12:52,718 --> 00:12:56,584
There were more copycats last night,
Alfred, with guns.

127
00:12:56,764 --> 00:12:58,672
Why not hire them,
take the weekend off?

128
00:12:58,849 --> 00:13:01,683
That wasn't exactly
what I had in mind...

129
00:13:01,852 --> 00:13:03,594
...when I said I wanted
to inspire people.

130
00:13:03,771 --> 00:13:05,679
I know.

131
00:13:05,856 --> 00:13:07,349
But things have improved.

132
00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:10,020
Look at the new district attorney.

133
00:13:10,694 --> 00:13:12,685
I am, closely.

134
00:13:12,863 --> 00:13:14,771
Need to know if he can be trusted.

135
00:13:14,948 --> 00:13:18,991
Are you interested in his character
or his social circle?

136
00:13:22,831 --> 00:13:25,202
Who Rachel spends her time with
is her business.

137
00:13:27,002 --> 00:13:29,242
I trust you don't have me followed
on my day off.

138
00:13:29,421 --> 00:13:31,495
If you ever took one, I might.

139
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:35,213
Know your limits, Master Wayne.

140
00:13:35,385 --> 00:13:38,503
Batman has no limits.

141
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,715
- Well, you do, sir.
- Well, can't afford to know them.

142
00:13:41,892 --> 00:13:44,381
And what's gonna happen
on the day that you find out?

143
00:13:44,561 --> 00:13:47,264
We all know how much you like to say
"I told you so."

144
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:50,771
On that day, Master Wayne,
even I won't want to.

145
00:13:50,942 --> 00:13:52,399
Probably.

146
00:13:59,242 --> 00:14:00,900
Sorry I'm late, folks.

147
00:14:04,831 --> 00:14:07,036
- Where were you?
- Worried you'd have to step up?

148
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,207
- Harvey, I know these briefs backwards.
- Well, then...

149
00:14:10,378 --> 00:14:12,369
...fair's fair.

150
00:14:12,547 --> 00:14:14,585
Heads, I'll take it. Tails, he's all yours.

151
00:14:14,757 --> 00:14:16,831
Yeah? You wanna
flip a coin to see who leads?

152
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:20,423
My father's lucky coin. As I recall,
it got me my first date with you.

153
00:14:20,596 --> 00:14:23,761
I wouldn't leave something like that
up to chance.

154
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,183
I don't. I make my own luck.

155
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:32,731
All rise.
The Honorable Judge Freel presiding.

156
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,568
I thought the DA just
played golf with the mayor.

157
00:14:35,736 --> 00:14:39,435
Teeoff's 1:30. More than enough time
to put you away for life, Sally.

158
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,156
With Carmine Falcone in Arkham...

159
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:44,324
...someone must have stepped up
to run the so-called family.

160
00:14:45,204 --> 00:14:47,444
Is that man in this courtroom today?

161
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:52,616
- Could you identify him for us, please?
- You win, counselor.

162
00:14:54,963 --> 00:14:56,456
It was me.

163
00:14:58,175 --> 00:15:01,957
I have a sworn statement from you
that this man...

164
00:15:02,137 --> 00:15:05,836
...Salvatore Maroni, is the new head
of the Falcone crime family.

165
00:15:06,016 --> 00:15:10,142
Maroni? He's a fall guy.
I'm the brains of the organization.

166
00:15:11,521 --> 00:15:13,062
Order.
- Permission to treat...

167
00:15:13,231 --> 00:15:14,474
...the witness as hostile?
- Granted.

168
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,680
- Hostile? I'll show you hostile!

169
00:15:21,907 --> 00:15:24,657
Carbon fiber, .28 caliber,
made in China.

170
00:15:24,826 --> 00:15:26,367
If you wanna kill a
public servant, Mr. Maroni...

171
00:15:26,536 --> 00:15:28,741
...I recommend you buy American.

172
00:15:29,664 --> 00:15:32,284
Get him out of here.
- But, Your Honor, I'm not done.

173
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:39,288
We'll never be able to link the gun
to Maroni, so we can't charge him.

174
00:15:39,466 --> 00:15:42,252
But they're trying to kill you,
means we're getting to them.

175
00:15:42,427 --> 00:15:45,545
I'm glad you're so pleased, Rachel.
I'm fine, by the way.

176
00:15:45,722 --> 00:15:47,428
Come on, Harvey. You're Gotham's DA.

177
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:50,433
You're not getting shot at,
you're not doing your job right.

178
00:15:50,602 --> 00:15:51,799
But, you know...

179
00:15:51,978 --> 00:15:55,310
...if you said you were rattled,
we could take the rest of the day off.

180
00:15:55,481 --> 00:15:58,397
Can't. I dragged the head of
the Major Crimes Unit down here.

181
00:15:58,568 --> 00:16:03,312
Oh, Jim Gordon? He's a friend, actually.
Try to be nice.

182
00:16:12,373 --> 00:16:15,159
I hear you got a hell of a right cross.

183
00:16:18,462 --> 00:16:20,583
It's a shame Sal's going to walk.

184
00:16:20,756 --> 00:16:24,799
Yeah, well, good thing about the Mob
is they keep giving you second chances.

185
00:16:29,974 --> 00:16:32,298
Lightly irradiated bills.

186
00:16:32,768 --> 00:16:35,055
Fancy stuff for a city cop. Have help?

187
00:16:35,521 --> 00:16:37,227
We liaise with various agencies...

188
00:16:37,398 --> 00:16:39,140
Save it, Gordon. I wanna meet him.

189
00:16:39,316 --> 00:16:42,897
Official policy is to arrest the vigilante
known as Batman on sight.

190
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,227
Mm-hm. What about that floodlight
on the top of MCU?

191
00:16:45,406 --> 00:16:47,812
If you got problems
with malfunctioning equipment...

192
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:51,193
...I suggest you take them up
with Maintenance, counselor.

193
00:16:51,495 --> 00:16:54,031
I've put every money launderer
in Gotham behind bars...

194
00:16:54,206 --> 00:16:56,577
...but the Mob
is still getting its money out.

195
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,200
I think you and your friend
have found the last game in town.

196
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:03,082
You're trying to hit them
where it hurts, their wallets.

197
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:04,417
It's bold.

198
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:06,497
You gonna count me in?

199
00:17:07,052 --> 00:17:10,419
In this town, the fewer people know
something, the safer the operation.

200
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:12,837
I don't like that you got
your own special unit...

201
00:17:13,016 --> 00:17:15,932
...and it's full of cops
I investigated at Internal Affairs.

202
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:18,936
If I didn't work with cops
you'd investigated while at IA...

203
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,348
...I'd be working alone.

204
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:23,015
I don't get political points
for being an idealist.

205
00:17:23,193 --> 00:17:25,599
I do the best I can with what I have.

206
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:32,946
You want me to back warrants
for search and seizure on five banks...

207
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,944
...without telling me what we're after.

208
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:38,611
I can give you the names of the banks.

209
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,699
Well, that's a start.

210
00:17:41,085 --> 00:17:43,409
I'll get you your warrants,
but I want your trust.

211
00:17:43,588 --> 00:17:45,246
Oh, you don't have
to sell me, Dent.

212
00:17:45,423 --> 00:17:47,414
We all know you're Gotham's
white knight.

213
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:52,126
Yeah, well, I heard they have
a different name for me down at MCU.

214
00:17:52,722 --> 00:17:54,001
I wouldn't know about that.

215
00:17:55,183 --> 00:17:58,965
In China, Lau Security Investments
stands for dynamic new growth.

216
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:03,437
A joint Chinese venture with
Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.

217
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:05,516
Well, Mr. Lau...

218
00:18:05,902 --> 00:18:08,652
...I speak for the rest of the board...

219
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:12,154
...and Mr. Wayne,
in expressing our own excitement.

220
00:18:17,037 --> 00:18:20,654
Sir, I know Mr. Wayne is curious about
how his trust fund gets replenished...

221
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,322
...but, frankly, this is embarrassing.

222
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,074
You worry about the diligence,
Mr. Reese.

223
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:28,542
I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.

224
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:30,257
It's done.

225
00:18:30,426 --> 00:18:32,168
The numbers are solid.

226
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:33,885
Do them again.

227
00:18:34,054 --> 00:18:37,137
Wouldn't want the trust fund to run out,
now, would we?

228
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,475
Another long night?

229
00:18:41,645 --> 00:18:44,597
This joint venture was your idea,
and the consultants love it.

230
00:18:45,274 --> 00:18:46,517
But I'm not convinced.

231
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:50,356
Lau's company has grown by
8 percent annually like clockwork.

232
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,935
His revenue stream
must be off the books...

233
00:18:53,115 --> 00:18:54,524
...maybe even illegal.

234
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,358
Okay. Cancel the deal.

235
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:58,864
You already knew.

236
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:02,115
Just needed a closer look at their books.

237
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,328
Anything else you can trouble me for?

238
00:19:04,793 --> 00:19:06,334
I need a new suit.

239
00:19:06,503 --> 00:19:08,992
Yeah. Three buttons
is a little '90s, Mr. Wayne.

240
00:19:09,172 --> 00:19:12,290
I'm not talking fashion, Mr. Fox,
so much as function.

241
00:19:13,343 --> 00:19:15,049
You wanna be able to turn your head.

242
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,294
Sure make backing out
of the driveway easier.

243
00:19:17,764 --> 00:19:19,305
I'll see what I can do.

244
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:26,018
Took three weeks
to get a reservation here.

245
00:19:26,189 --> 00:19:28,310
I had to tell them
I work for the government.

246
00:19:28,483 --> 00:19:29,726
- Really?
- Health inspector's...

247
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:31,144
...not afraid to pull strings.

248
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:33,524
Rachel. Fancy that.

249
00:19:33,696 --> 00:19:36,185
Yeah, Bruce. Fancy that.

250
00:19:36,532 --> 00:19:38,689
Rachel, Natascha. Natascha, Rachel.

251
00:19:38,868 --> 00:19:44,240
- Natascha. Are you the prima...?
- Prima ballerina for the Moscow Ballet.

252
00:19:44,415 --> 00:19:47,747
- Wow. Harvey's taking me next week.
- Really? So you're into ballet?

253
00:19:48,085 --> 00:19:50,242
Bruce. This is Harvey Dent.

254
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:54,335
The famous Bruce Wayne.
Rachel's told me everything about you.

255
00:19:54,508 --> 00:19:55,705
I certainly hope not.

256
00:19:56,052 --> 00:19:59,384
- Let's put a couple tables together.
- I'm not sure that they'll let us.

257
00:19:59,555 --> 00:20:02,590
Oh, they should. I own the place.

258
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:06,011
How could you want to raise children
in a city like this?

259
00:20:06,187 --> 00:20:08,143
Well, I was raised here.
I turned out okay.

260
00:20:08,314 --> 00:20:09,890
Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?

261
00:20:10,065 --> 00:20:11,558
Is...? Heh-heh.

262
00:20:11,734 --> 00:20:13,275
The Palisades? Sure.

263
00:20:13,444 --> 00:20:15,898
You know, as our new DA,
you might wanna figure out...

264
00:20:16,071 --> 00:20:17,896
...where your jurisdiction ends.

265
00:20:18,073 --> 00:20:22,021
I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante.

266
00:20:22,202 --> 00:20:25,569
Gotham City is proud of an ordinary
citizen standing up for what's right.

267
00:20:25,748 --> 00:20:27,988
Gotham needs heroes like you,
elected officials...

268
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:30,123
...not a man who thinks
he's above the law.

269
00:20:30,294 --> 00:20:31,455
Who appointed the Batman?

270
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:35,458
We did. All of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city.

271
00:20:35,632 --> 00:20:37,374
But this is a democracy, Harvey.

272
00:20:37,551 --> 00:20:39,293
When their enemies were at the gates...

273
00:20:39,469 --> 00:20:43,168
...the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city.

274
00:20:43,347 --> 00:20:45,919
It wasn't considered an honor,
it was a public service.

275
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,758
Harvey, the last man
that they appointed...

276
00:20:47,935 --> 00:20:50,222
...to protect the republic
was named Caesar...

277
00:20:50,396 --> 00:20:53,810
...and he never gave up his power.
- Okay, fine.

278
00:20:53,983 --> 00:20:55,310
You either die a hero...

279
00:20:55,484 --> 00:20:58,519
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

280
00:20:58,696 --> 00:21:02,194
Whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
wanna do this for the rest of his life.

281
00:21:02,366 --> 00:21:05,615
How could he? Batman is looking for
someone to take up his mantle.

282
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:08,073
Someone like you, Mr. Dent?

283
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:10,993
Maybe. If I'm up to it.

284
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:16,407
What if Harvey Dent
is the Caped Crusader? Hm?

285
00:21:18,674 --> 00:21:21,839
If I were sneaking out every night,
someone would've noticed by now.

286
00:21:24,221 --> 00:21:28,347
Well, I'm sold, Dent,
and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.

287
00:21:28,517 --> 00:21:31,351
That's nice, but I'm not
up for reelection for three years.

288
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,428
No, you don't understand.

289
00:21:33,605 --> 00:21:36,391
One fundraiser with my pals...

290
00:21:37,025 --> 00:21:39,146
...you'll never need another cent.

291
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,996
What the hell is this?

292
00:21:57,337 --> 00:22:00,455
As you're all aware,
one of our deposits was stolen.

293
00:22:00,632 --> 00:22:03,999
A relatively small amount, 68 million.

294
00:22:04,177 --> 00:22:06,713
Who's stupid enough to steal from us?

295
00:22:07,055 --> 00:22:10,588
Two-bit wackjob,
wears a cheap purple suit and makeup.

296
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:12,723
He's not the problem. He's a nobody.

297
00:22:12,894 --> 00:22:16,261
The problem is our money
being tracked by the cops.

298
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:18,928
Thanks to Mr. Maroni's
well-placed sources...

299
00:22:19,108 --> 00:22:22,890
... we know that police have indeed
identified our banks using marked bills...

300
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:25,559
... and are planning to
seize your funds today.

301
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,736
And since the enthusiastic new D A has
put all my competitors out of business...

302
00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:33,867
...I'm your only option.
MARONl: So, what are you proposing?

303
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:37,703
Moving all deposits to
one secure location, not a bank.

304
00:22:37,877 --> 00:22:39,833
- Where, then?
- No one can know but me.

305
00:22:40,588 --> 00:22:43,338
If the police were to gain leverage
over one of you...

306
00:22:43,507 --> 00:22:45,297
... everyone's money would be at stake.

307
00:22:45,467 --> 00:22:47,588
What stop them getting to you?

308
00:22:47,761 --> 00:22:50,844
I go to Hong Kong,
far from Dent's jurisdiction...

309
00:22:51,223 --> 00:22:54,092
... and the Chinese will not extradite
one of their own.

310
00:22:54,268 --> 00:22:55,891
MARONl:
How soon can you move the money?

311
00:22:56,186 --> 00:22:57,264
I already have.

312
00:22:59,648 --> 00:23:02,268
For obvious reasons, I couldn't wait
for your permission.

313
00:23:02,901 --> 00:23:06,565
Rest assured, your money is safe.

314
00:23:13,745 --> 00:23:18,738
Oh, hee-hee, aha.
Ha, ooh, hee, ha-ha, ha-ha.

315
00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:21,157
And I thought my jokes were bad.

316
00:23:21,336 --> 00:23:24,419
Give me one reason why I shouldn't
have my boy pull your head off.

317
00:23:24,589 --> 00:23:25,868
How about a magic trick?

318
00:23:29,219 --> 00:23:31,543
I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.

319
00:23:33,848 --> 00:23:34,961
Ta-da!

320
00:23:35,141 --> 00:23:36,634
It's...

321
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,097
It's gone.

322
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:41,803
Oh, and by the way,
the suit, it wasn't cheap.

323
00:23:41,981 --> 00:23:44,815
- You ought to know, you bought it.
Sit.

324
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:48,937
I want to hear proposition.

325
00:23:51,658 --> 00:23:54,147
Let's wind the clocks back a year.

326
00:23:54,494 --> 00:24:00,163
These cops and lawyers
wouldn't dare cross any of you.

327
00:24:01,334 --> 00:24:03,455
I mean, what happened?

328
00:24:03,628 --> 00:24:07,410
Did your balls drop off? Hm?

329
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,628
You see, a guy like me...

330
00:24:10,092 --> 00:24:12,842
- A freak.
Damn right.

331
00:24:13,012 --> 00:24:16,130
A guy like me... Look, listen.

332
00:24:16,682 --> 00:24:20,974
I know why you choose
to have your little, ahem...

333
00:24:21,145 --> 00:24:23,848
...group-therapy sessions
in broad daylight.

334
00:24:24,356 --> 00:24:27,142
I know why you're afraid
to go out at night.

335
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:31,019
The Batman.

336
00:24:31,197 --> 00:24:36,438
See, Batman has shown Gotham
your true colors, unfortunately.

337
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:40,117
Dent, he's just the beginning.

338
00:24:40,706 --> 00:24:45,450
And as for the television's
so-called plan...

339
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,791
...Batman has no jurisdiction.

340
00:24:47,963 --> 00:24:50,535
He'll find him and make him squeal.

341
00:24:50,716 --> 00:24:53,715
I know the squealers when I see them...

342
00:24:53,886 --> 00:24:55,544
...and...

343
00:24:56,305 --> 00:24:57,798
What do you propose?

344
00:24:57,973 --> 00:25:00,379
It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman.

345
00:25:01,727 --> 00:25:04,679
If it's so simple, why haven't
you done it already?

346
00:25:04,855 --> 00:25:07,558
If you're good at something,
never do it for free.

347
00:25:08,233 --> 00:25:09,512
How much you want?

348
00:25:10,235 --> 00:25:12,226
Uh, half.

349
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:17,197
You're crazy.
- No, I'm not.

350
00:25:17,367 --> 00:25:19,488
No, I'm not.

351
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:24,493
If we don't deal with this now...

352
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:26,289
...soon...

353
00:25:26,501 --> 00:25:31,411
...little Gambol here won't be able
to get a nickel for his grandma.

354
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,547
Enough from the clown!

355
00:25:33,716 --> 00:25:36,668
Ah, ta-ta-ta. Let's not blow...

356
00:25:36,844 --> 00:25:39,380
Shit!
...this out of proportion.

357
00:25:39,555 --> 00:25:42,044
You think you can steal from us
and just walk away?

358
00:25:42,225 --> 00:25:43,766
- Yeah.
I'm putting the word out.

359
00:25:43,935 --> 00:25:46,222
Five hundred grand for this clown dead.

360
00:25:46,396 --> 00:25:49,431
A million alive, so I can teach him
some manners first.

361
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:53,305
All right. So, listen,
why don't you give me a call...

362
00:25:53,486 --> 00:25:57,233
...when you wanna start taking things
a little more seriously?

363
00:25:57,406 --> 00:25:59,278
Here's my card.

364
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:05,367
Mm-mm.

365
00:26:19,386 --> 00:26:21,757
You're a hard man to reach.

366
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:27,054
Lau's halfway to Hong Kong.

367
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:31,188
If you'd have asked,
I could have taken his passport.

368
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:34,024
All that was left in the vaults
were marked bills.

369
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:37,477
They knew we were coming.
As soon as your office got involved...

370
00:26:37,654 --> 00:26:38,684
My office?

371
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:42,528
You're sitting down there with scum like
Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking...

372
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:45,819
Oh, yeah. I almost had your rookie
cold on a racketeering beat.

373
00:26:45,996 --> 00:26:50,537
Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly
Maroni's got people in your office, Dent.

374
00:26:53,336 --> 00:26:55,292
We need Lau back...

375
00:26:55,464 --> 00:26:59,412
...but the Chinese won't extradite
a national under any circumstances.

376
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:02,462
If I get him to you,
can you get him to talk?

377
00:27:02,637 --> 00:27:03,834
I'll get him to sing.

378
00:27:04,014 --> 00:27:06,764
We're going after the Mob's life savings.

379
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:08,176
Things will get ugly.

380
00:27:08,351 --> 00:27:10,638
I knew the risk when I took this job,
lieutenant.

381
00:27:10,812 --> 00:27:12,353
How will you get him back, any...?

382
00:27:14,941 --> 00:27:16,350
He does that.

383
00:27:16,526 --> 00:27:20,024
Our Chinese friends left town
before I could tell them the deal was off.

384
00:27:20,196 --> 00:27:23,694
Well, I'm sure that you've always
wanted to go to Hong Kong.

385
00:27:23,867 --> 00:27:26,024
What's wrong with a phone call?

386
00:27:26,202 --> 00:27:29,819
I think Mr. Lau deserves
a more personal touch.

387
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,865
Now, for high-altitude jumps...

388
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:35,828
...you're going to need oxygen
and stabilizers.

389
00:27:36,003 --> 00:27:39,620
Well, I must say,
compared to your usual requests...

390
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:42,371
...jumping out of an airplane
is pretty straightforward.

391
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,131
What about getting back into the plane?

392
00:27:45,304 --> 00:27:49,134
- I'd recommend a good travel agent.
- Without it landing.

393
00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:53,059
Now, that's more like it, Mr. Wayne.

394
00:27:53,604 --> 00:27:56,224
The CIA had a program
back in the '60s...

395
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,731
...for getting their people out
of hot spots called Sky Hook.

396
00:27:59,902 --> 00:28:02,570
- We could look into that.
- Yeah.

397
00:28:02,738 --> 00:28:04,396
Okay. Now...

398
00:28:05,908 --> 00:28:08,611
Hardened Kevlar plates
over titanium-dipped...

399
00:28:08,786 --> 00:28:10,907
...tri-weave fibers for flexibility.

400
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,914
You'll be lighter, faster, more agile.

401
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:19,576
Perhaps you should
read the instructions first?

402
00:28:19,755 --> 00:28:21,746
- Yeah.
- Now, there is a tradeoff.

403
00:28:21,924 --> 00:28:25,422
Separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.

404
00:28:25,594 --> 00:28:28,546
We wouldn't wanna make things
too easy, now, would we?

405
00:28:28,722 --> 00:28:30,760
How will it hold up against dogs?

406
00:28:30,933 --> 00:28:33,054
We talking rottweilers or Chihuahuas?

407
00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:36,758
Should do fine against cats.

408
00:28:36,938 --> 00:28:39,059
I found one in Arizona.

409
00:28:39,232 --> 00:28:42,148
A very nice man said he could have it
up and running in a week...

410
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:43,397
...and he takes cash.

411
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:46,404
- What about the flight crew?
- South Korean smugglers.

412
00:28:46,573 --> 00:28:48,778
They run flights into Pyongyang,
below radar.

413
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:51,700
- Did you think of an alibi?
- Oh, yes.

414
00:29:10,472 --> 00:29:13,092
I believe this is your plane, sir.

415
00:29:17,312 --> 00:29:20,810
You look tired, Alfred.
You'll be all right without me?

416
00:29:22,483 --> 00:29:25,981
If you can tell me the Russian for
"apply your own bloody suntan lotion."

417
00:29:37,123 --> 00:29:40,953
Yo, Gambol, somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the Joker.

418
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:42,952
They brought the body.

419
00:29:59,353 --> 00:30:01,842
So, dead, that's 500.

420
00:30:03,816 --> 00:30:05,606
How about alive? Hm?

421
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,985
You wanna know how I got these scars?

422
00:30:13,908 --> 00:30:16,907
My father was...

423
00:30:17,078 --> 00:30:18,535
...a drinker...

424
00:30:18,704 --> 00:30:19,947
...and a fiend.

425
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:24,952
And one night,
he goes off crazier than usual.

426
00:30:25,378 --> 00:30:28,164
Mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself.

427
00:30:28,339 --> 00:30:29,880
He doesn't like that...

428
00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:33,499
...not one bit.

429
00:30:33,677 --> 00:30:36,213
So, me watching...

430
00:30:36,388 --> 00:30:40,965
...he takes the knife to her,
laughing while he does it.

431
00:30:41,143 --> 00:30:44,226
He turns to me and he says:

432
00:30:44,396 --> 00:30:48,060
"Why so serious?"

433
00:30:48,317 --> 00:30:49,893
He comes at me with the knife.

434
00:30:50,569 --> 00:30:52,477
"Why so serious?"

435
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,609
He sticks the blade in my mouth.

436
00:30:57,951 --> 00:31:01,864
"Let's put a smile on that face."

437
00:31:03,081 --> 00:31:05,286
And...

438
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:09,210
Why so serious?

439
00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:15,752
Now...

440
00:31:15,927 --> 00:31:18,167
...our operation is small...

441
00:31:18,346 --> 00:31:21,262
...but there is a lot of potential...

442
00:31:21,433 --> 00:31:23,969
...for aggressive expansion.

443
00:31:24,144 --> 00:31:27,346
So which of you fine gentlemen
would like to join our team?

444
00:31:27,522 --> 00:31:31,933
Oh. There's only one spot open
right now, so we're gonna have...

445
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:34,767
...tryouts.

446
00:31:39,367 --> 00:31:41,358
Make it fast.

447
00:31:50,795 --> 00:31:52,204
Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox.

448
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,083
Mr. Lau regrets he is unable
to greet you in person today.

449
00:31:55,258 --> 00:31:57,166
I understand.

450
00:32:06,978 --> 00:32:10,559
For security purposes, I'm gonna have to
ask you to check in your mobile.

451
00:32:10,731 --> 00:32:12,307
Of course.

452
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:18,768
I must apologize for leaving Gotham
in the middle of our negotiations.

453
00:32:18,948 --> 00:32:22,481
This misunderstanding
with the Gotham police force...

454
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,196
...I couldn't let it threaten my company.
- Of course.

455
00:32:25,371 --> 00:32:28,536
A businessman of your stature
will understand and...

456
00:32:28,707 --> 00:32:32,655
...with you here now, we can continue.

457
00:32:32,836 --> 00:32:36,583
Well, I do appreciate you bringing me
out here in such style, Mr. Lau, but I re...

458
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:39,958
We do not allow cell phones in here.

459
00:32:40,135 --> 00:32:42,838
I'm sorry. Forgot I had it.

460
00:32:43,013 --> 00:32:47,638
No, I really came to tell you that
our business deal has to be put on hold.

461
00:32:48,185 --> 00:32:51,268
You see, we can't afford
to be seen to do business with...

462
00:32:52,397 --> 00:32:54,353
...whatever it is you're accused of being.

463
00:32:54,524 --> 00:32:57,096
I'm sure a businessman of your stature
will understand.

464
00:32:57,277 --> 00:33:01,190
I think, Mr. Fox, a simple phone call
might have sufficed.

465
00:33:01,364 --> 00:33:04,731
Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think
he was deliberately wasting your time.

466
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,533
Just accidentally wasting it.

467
00:33:07,537 --> 00:33:11,699
That's very good, Mr. Lau.
"Accidentally." Very good.

468
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,827
Hey, sir.

469
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:34,052
There's a better view
from the peak tram.

470
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:36,055
How's the view from LSI Holdings?

471
00:33:36,357 --> 00:33:37,898
Restricted.

472
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:40,058
Lau is holed up in there good and tight.

473
00:33:40,236 --> 00:33:42,144
- What's this?
- I had R & D work it up.

474
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:43,979
Sends out a high-frequency pulse...

475
00:33:44,157 --> 00:33:46,991
...records the response time
for mapping an environment.

476
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:50,065
Sonar. Just like a...

477
00:33:50,246 --> 00:33:52,403
Submarine, Mr. Wayne.
Like a submarine.

478
00:33:52,915 --> 00:33:54,740
- And the other device?
- It's in place.

479
00:33:55,668 --> 00:33:56,698
Mr. Wayne?

480
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,199
Good luck.

481
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:52,355
Look, give us the money
and we'll talk about making a deal.

482
00:37:52,526 --> 00:37:55,810
The money is the only reason
I'm still alive.

483
00:37:55,988 --> 00:38:00,114
Oh, you mean, when they find out that
you've helped us, they're gonna kill you?

484
00:38:00,284 --> 00:38:01,990
- Are you threatening my client?
- No.

485
00:38:02,161 --> 00:38:06,371
I'm just assuming your client's
cooperation with this investigation.

486
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,658
As will everyone.

487
00:38:11,003 --> 00:38:14,335
No? Okay.

488
00:38:14,798 --> 00:38:17,797
Enjoy your time in County, Mr. Lau.

489
00:38:17,968 --> 00:38:19,461
Wait!

490
00:38:19,678 --> 00:38:21,669
I won't give you the money...

491
00:38:21,847 --> 00:38:24,846
...but I will give you my clients,
all of them.

492
00:38:25,142 --> 00:38:27,347
You were a glorified accountant.

493
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:31,349
What could you possibly have
on all of them that we could charge?

494
00:38:31,523 --> 00:38:35,353
I'm good with calculation.
I handled all their investments.

495
00:38:35,527 --> 00:38:37,103
One big pot.

496
00:38:38,488 --> 00:38:39,815
Got it.

497
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,065
One minute.

498
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:45,570
RICO. If they pooled their money...

499
00:38:45,745 --> 00:38:47,535
...we can charge them
as one criminal conspiracy.

500
00:38:47,706 --> 00:38:48,867
Charge them with what?

501
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,909
In a RICO case, if you can charge
one of them with a felony...

502
00:38:52,085 --> 00:38:54,657
You can charge all of them with it.
That's great.

503
00:38:56,047 --> 00:38:57,955
Mr. Lau.

504
00:38:58,967 --> 00:39:02,963
What kind of details do you have
about this communal fund?

505
00:39:03,137 --> 00:39:04,760
- Ledgers...?
- Immunity, protection...

506
00:39:04,931 --> 00:39:08,381
...a chartered plane back to Hong Kong.
- After you testify in open court.

507
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:10,883
I'm just curious.
With all your clients locked up...

508
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:13,434
...what's gonna happen
with all that money?

509
00:39:13,606 --> 00:39:16,724
Like I said, I'm good with calculation.

510
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:21,561
He can't go to County.
I'll keep him here in the holding cells.

511
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:24,275
What is this, Gordon, your fortress?

512
00:39:24,575 --> 00:39:27,243
Well, you trust them over at County?

513
00:39:27,411 --> 00:39:29,236
I don't trust them here.

514
00:39:30,998 --> 00:39:32,491
Lau stays.

515
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:35,530
Well, I don 't know about
Mr. Lau's travel arrangements...

516
00:39:35,711 --> 00:39:37,501
... but I'm sure glad he's back.

517
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,124
Put word out. We hire the clown.

518
00:39:42,926 --> 00:39:46,756
He was right.
We have to fix real problem.

519
00:39:47,263 --> 00:39:48,376
Batman.

520
00:39:52,935 --> 00:39:56,848
- I'm not aware of any participation...
- Our boy looks good on the tube.

521
00:39:57,356 --> 00:40:00,106
You sure you wanna embarrass me
in front of my friends?

522
00:40:00,276 --> 00:40:03,940
Oh, don't worry. They're coming too.

523
00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:12,611
Have a nice trip. See you next fall.

524
00:40:12,788 --> 00:40:14,613
Seven hundred
twelve counts of extortion.

525
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:17,196
Eight hundred and forty-nine
counts of racketeering.

526
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:19,912
Two hundred and forty-six
counts of fraud.

527
00:40:20,087 --> 00:40:22,921
Eighty-seven counts
of conspiracy murder.

528
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:26,959
Five hundred and twenty-seven
counts of obstruction of justice.

529
00:40:27,386 --> 00:40:28,760
How do the defendants plead?

530
00:40:35,936 --> 00:40:36,966
Order in the court.

531
00:40:37,146 --> 00:40:39,635
Five hundred and forty-nine
criminals at once.

532
00:40:39,815 --> 00:40:42,304
How did you convince Surrillo
to hear this farce?

533
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:46,610
She shares my enthusiasm for justice.
After all, she is a judge.

534
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,815
Even if you blow enough smoke
to get convictions out of Surrillo...

535
00:40:49,992 --> 00:40:52,564
...you're gonna set
a new record at appeals.

536
00:40:52,744 --> 00:40:55,233
It won't matter.
The head guys make bail, sure.

537
00:40:55,414 --> 00:40:57,820
But the midlevel guys, they can't.

538
00:40:57,999 --> 00:40:59,824
They can't afford to be off the streets.

539
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:02,122
They'll cut deals that
include some jail time.

540
00:41:02,295 --> 00:41:05,294
Think of all you could do
with 18 months of clean streets.

541
00:41:06,841 --> 00:41:09,959
Mr. Mayor, you can't...
- No, get out. Both of you.

542
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,681
Sit down.

543
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:23,646
The public likes you. That's the
only reason that this might fly.

544
00:41:23,817 --> 00:41:25,144
But that means it's on you.

545
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:28,353
They're all gonna come after you now,
and not just the Mob.

546
00:41:28,529 --> 00:41:32,359
Politicians, journalists, cops.

547
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:35,022
Anyone whose wallet's
about to get lighter.

548
00:41:35,203 --> 00:41:37,871
Are you up to it? You'd better be.

549
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:40,160
Because they get anything on you...

550
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:45,124
...and those criminals are back on the
streets, followed swiftly by you and me.

551
00:41:45,296 --> 00:41:46,575
Jesus!

552
00:42:07,735 --> 00:42:10,189
I think your fundraiser
will be a great success, sir.

553
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:13,030
And why do you think I wanna
hold a party for Harvey Dent?

554
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:16,281
I assumed it was your usual reason
for socializing beyond myself...

555
00:42:16,452 --> 00:42:18,490
...and the scum of Gotham's underbelly:

556
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:20,452
To try to impress Miss Dawes.

557
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:24,701
Very droll, but very wrong.
Actually, it's Dent.

558
00:42:24,877 --> 00:42:27,746
Police released video
footage found concealed on the body.

559
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:30,541
Sensitive viewers, be aware.
The image is disturbing.

560
00:42:30,716 --> 00:42:32,921
Tell them your name.

561
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:34,751
Brian Douglas.

562
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:38,670
And are you the real Batman?

563
00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:39,879
No.
No?

564
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:42,014
- No.
- No?

565
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:43,891
Then why do you dress up like him?

566
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:46,469
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

567
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:50,727
Because he's a symbol that we
don 't have to be afraid of scum like you.

568
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:54,234
Yeah. You do, Brian. You really do.

569
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:58,023
Huh? Yeah. Oh, shh, shh, shh.

570
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:02,660
So you think Batman 's
made Gotham a better place? Hm?

571
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:04,413
Look at me.

572
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,869
Look at me!

573
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:14,128
You see, this is how crazy
Batman 's made Gotham.

574
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,587
You want order in Gotham...

575
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:21,339
... Batman must take off his mask
and turn himself in.

576
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:25,298
Oh, and every day he doesn 't,
people will die.

577
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:27,766
Starting tonight.

578
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:30,394
I'm a man of my word.

579
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:50,500
Harvey Dent,
scourge of the underworld...

580
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:53,752
...scared stiff by the trust-fund brigade.

581
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:55,166
- I'll be back.
- Rachel.

582
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:58,175
A little liquid courage, Mr. Dent?

583
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,750
- Thank you. Alfred, right?
- That's right, sir.

584
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:04,214
Rachel talks about you all the time.
You've known her her whole life.

585
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,634
Not yet, sir.

586
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:10,176
Any psychotic ex-boyfriends
I should be aware of?

587
00:44:10,355 --> 00:44:12,595
Oh, you have no idea.

588
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:32,952
I'm sorry that I'm late.

589
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,499
I'm glad to see
that you all got started without me.

590
00:44:35,672 --> 00:44:39,371
Now, where is Harvey? Where...?

591
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,957
Harvey Dent, the man of the hour.

592
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,464
Where's Rachel Dawes?

593
00:44:43,638 --> 00:44:46,009
She is my oldest friend. Come here.

594
00:44:46,182 --> 00:44:48,671
When Rachel first told me she
was dating Harvey Dent...

595
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,049
...I had one thing to say:

596
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,676
"The guy from those God-awful
campaign commercials?"

597
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:56,686
"I believe in Harvey Dent."
Yeah, nice slogan, Harvey.

598
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,851
But it caught Rachel's attention.

599
00:44:59,028 --> 00:45:02,027
And then I started to pay attention
to Harvey...

600
00:45:02,448 --> 00:45:05,732
...and all that he's been doing
as our new DA.

601
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:07,700
And you know what?

602
00:45:09,747 --> 00:45:11,240
I believe in Harvey Dent.

603
00:45:11,416 --> 00:45:14,997
I believe that on his watch,
Gotham can feel...

604
00:45:15,169 --> 00:45:18,833
...a little safer, a little more optimistic.

605
00:45:20,258 --> 00:45:24,586
Look at this face. This is the face
of Gotham's bright future.

606
00:45:24,762 --> 00:45:26,919
To Harvey Dent. Let's hear it for him.

607
00:45:27,306 --> 00:45:28,847
Harvey.

608
00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:39,816
Harvey may not know you
well enough...

609
00:45:39,985 --> 00:45:41,941
...to understand you're
making fun of him...

610
00:45:42,113 --> 00:45:44,104
...but I do.
- No, I meant every word.

611
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:48,365
You know that day
that you once told me about...

612
00:45:48,536 --> 00:45:50,610
...when Gotham would no longer
need Batman?

613
00:45:50,788 --> 00:45:52,696
- It's coming.
- Bruce.

614
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:59,125
- You can't ask me to wait for that.
- It's happening now. Harvey is that hero.

615
00:45:59,296 --> 00:46:03,755
He locked up half of the city's criminals,
and he did it without wearing a mask.

616
00:46:03,926 --> 00:46:06,131
Gotham needs a hero with a face.

617
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:09,257
You can throw a party, Wayne,
I'll give you that.

618
00:46:10,641 --> 00:46:12,549
Thanks again.

619
00:46:13,352 --> 00:46:15,058
You mind if I borrow Rachel?

620
00:46:18,523 --> 00:46:20,894
Lieutenant, that joker card
pinned to the body?

621
00:46:21,068 --> 00:46:22,810
Forensics found three sets of DNA.

622
00:46:22,986 --> 00:46:24,395
- Any matches?
- All three.

623
00:46:24,571 --> 00:46:28,069
The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.

624
00:46:28,241 --> 00:46:30,232
The Joker's telling us
who he's targeting.

625
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:33,279
Get a unit over to Surrillo's house.
Tell Wuertz to find Dent.

626
00:46:33,455 --> 00:46:35,493
Protective custody.
Where's the commissioner?

627
00:46:35,665 --> 00:46:37,158
- City hall.
- Seal the building.

628
00:46:37,334 --> 00:46:39,325
- No one in or out till I get there.
- Got it.

629
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:54,010
Gordon. What are you up to?

630
00:46:54,183 --> 00:46:57,432
We're secure. I want a floor-by-floor
search of the entire building.

631
00:46:57,604 --> 00:47:00,176
We believe the Joker's
made a threat against your life.

632
00:47:00,356 --> 00:47:01,765
These are dangerous people.

633
00:47:01,941 --> 00:47:03,683
You're not giving me
a lot of information.

634
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,816
Even we don't know
where you're going.

635
00:47:05,987 --> 00:47:09,319
Take the envelope, get in, open it.
It'll tell you where you're headed.

636
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,068
You can't leave me alone
with these people.

637
00:47:15,246 --> 00:47:18,281
The whole Mob's after you
and you're worried about these guys?

638
00:47:18,457 --> 00:47:20,413
Compared to this,
the Mob doesn't scare me.

639
00:47:20,584 --> 00:47:24,165
Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this
for yourself, so...

640
00:47:24,338 --> 00:47:28,417
...take my word, the police commissioner
earns a lot of threats.

641
00:47:28,592 --> 00:47:34,130
I found the appropriate response
to these situations a long time ago.

642
00:47:34,348 --> 00:47:36,588
Them gunning for you
makes you see things clearly.

643
00:47:36,767 --> 00:47:38,094
Yeah, I bet.

644
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:42,561
Yeah. It makes you think about things
you couldn't stand losing...

645
00:47:42,731 --> 00:47:44,722
...about who you wanna
spend your life with.

646
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,899
- That's a pretty big commitment.
- Not if the Mob has their way.

647
00:47:53,117 --> 00:47:55,820
You get to explain to my wife...

648
00:47:56,745 --> 00:47:58,321
...why I'm late for dinner.

649
00:47:58,497 --> 00:48:01,662
Sir, the joker card
had traces of your DNA on it.

650
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:05,871
- Don't do that.
- All right.

651
00:48:06,421 --> 00:48:09,337
- Let's be serious, then.
- Okay.

652
00:48:09,674 --> 00:48:10,704
What's your answer?

653
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:18,383
I don't have an answer.

654
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,590
How'd they get my DNA?

655
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,927
Somebody with access
to your office or house...

656
00:48:24,105 --> 00:48:26,725
...must have lifted a tissue
or a glass... Wait! Wait!

657
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,816
- Well, I guess no answer is a no.
- Harvey.

658
00:48:29,986 --> 00:48:32,107
- It's someone else, isn't it?
- Harvey.

659
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,445
Just tell me it's not Wayne.
The guy's a complete f...

660
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:37,407
What are you doing?

661
00:48:48,588 --> 00:48:49,618
Oh, shit.

662
00:48:55,803 --> 00:48:57,545
Get a medic!

663
00:49:00,975 --> 00:49:02,088
They've come for him.

664
00:49:03,603 --> 00:49:04,764
We made it.

665
00:49:07,355 --> 00:49:08,385
Stay hidden.

666
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:13,982
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

667
00:49:16,906 --> 00:49:20,819
We are tonight's entertainment.

668
00:49:21,661 --> 00:49:23,985
I only have one question:

669
00:49:24,205 --> 00:49:27,738
Where is Harvey Dent?

670
00:49:37,218 --> 00:49:39,292
You know where Harvey is?
You know who he is?

671
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:40,749
Hands up, pretty boy.

672
00:49:47,895 --> 00:49:50,681
Do you know where I can find Harvey?
I need to talk to him.

673
00:49:50,856 --> 00:49:53,690
Just something little, huh? No.

674
00:49:55,986 --> 00:49:58,736
What's going on out there? Wayne!

675
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:01,573
Oh, thank God, you've
got a panic room.

676
00:50:01,742 --> 00:50:02,903
Hey, wait...

677
00:50:03,494 --> 00:50:05,284
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

678
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:07,570
You know, I'll settle for his loved ones.

679
00:50:07,748 --> 00:50:11,246
We're not intimidated by thugs.

680
00:50:12,211 --> 00:50:13,917
You know...

681
00:50:15,547 --> 00:50:18,546
...you remind me of my father.

682
00:50:19,009 --> 00:50:20,834
I hated my father.

683
00:50:21,011 --> 00:50:23,049
Okay, stop.

684
00:50:26,892 --> 00:50:29,726
Well, hello, beautiful.

685
00:50:31,897 --> 00:50:35,727
You must be Harvey's squeeze. Hm?

686
00:50:36,109 --> 00:50:38,598
And you are beautiful.

687
00:50:45,535 --> 00:50:49,401
You look nervous. Is it the scars?

688
00:50:50,332 --> 00:50:52,537
You wanna know how I got them?

689
00:50:53,752 --> 00:50:56,288
Come here. Hey.

690
00:50:56,671 --> 00:50:58,377
Look at me.

691
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:03,584
So I had a wife.
She was beautiful, like you...

692
00:51:03,845 --> 00:51:08,055
...who tells me I worry too much...

693
00:51:08,224 --> 00:51:11,140
...who tells me I ought to smile more...

694
00:51:11,311 --> 00:51:16,814
...who gambles and gets in deep
with the sharks. Hey.

695
00:51:17,233 --> 00:51:19,639
One day they carve her face.

696
00:51:20,153 --> 00:51:24,398
And we have no money for surgeries.
She can't take it.

697
00:51:24,782 --> 00:51:28,280
I just wanna see her smile again. Hm?

698
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:31,535
I just want her to know
that I don't care about the scars.

699
00:51:32,081 --> 00:51:33,622
So...

700
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:37,872
...I stick a razor in my mouth
and do this...

701
00:51:38,337 --> 00:51:39,711
...to myself.

702
00:51:40,006 --> 00:51:45,081
And you know what?
She can't stand the sight of me.

703
00:51:45,261 --> 00:51:46,802
She leaves.

704
00:51:47,513 --> 00:51:49,919
Now I see the funny side.

705
00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:52,384
Now I'm always smiling.

706
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:59,145
You got a little fight in you. I like that.

707
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:00,643
Then you're gonna love me.

708
00:52:28,804 --> 00:52:30,001
Drop the gun.

709
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,800
Oh, sure. You just take off
your little mask...

710
00:52:32,974 --> 00:52:35,179
...and show us all who
you really are. Hm?

711
00:52:40,815 --> 00:52:42,012
Let her go.

712
00:52:42,817 --> 00:52:44,226
Very poor choice of words.

713
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,922
Are you all right?

714
00:53:11,179 --> 00:53:13,550
Let's not do that again.

715
00:53:13,848 --> 00:53:16,337
- Is Harvey okay?
- He's safe.

716
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:19,221
Thank you.

717
00:53:19,562 --> 00:53:20,592
Jim, it's over.

718
00:53:20,771 --> 00:53:23,343
As long as they don't get to Lau,
we've cut off their funds.

719
00:53:23,524 --> 00:53:25,017
The prosecution's over.

720
00:53:25,192 --> 00:53:26,850
Nobody's standing up
in front of a judge...

721
00:53:27,028 --> 00:53:30,027
...while judges and police commissioners
are getting blown away.

722
00:53:30,197 --> 00:53:31,987
- What about Dent?
- He's got any sense...

723
00:53:32,158 --> 00:53:33,236
...Dent's halfway to Mex...

724
00:53:33,409 --> 00:53:34,985
So where do you keep your trash?

725
00:53:36,328 --> 00:53:40,276
You're due in court. I need you alive
long enough to get you on the record.

726
00:53:40,457 --> 00:53:43,492
You can't protect me.
You can't even protect yourselves.

727
00:53:43,669 --> 00:53:47,001
You refuse to cooperate, you're not
coming back here, you go to County.

728
00:53:47,172 --> 00:53:49,626
How long do you calculate
you'll last in there?

729
00:53:51,051 --> 00:53:52,544
Targeting me won't get their money.

730
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,545
I knew the Mob wouldn't go
down easily...

731
00:53:54,722 --> 00:53:56,796
...but this is different.
They crossed a line.

732
00:53:56,974 --> 00:53:58,217
You crossed the line first.

733
00:53:58,392 --> 00:54:01,806
You squeezed them, you hammered them
to the point of desperation.

734
00:54:01,979 --> 00:54:06,972
And in their desperation, they turned to
a man they didn't fully understand.

735
00:54:07,484 --> 00:54:10,020
Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.

736
00:54:10,195 --> 00:54:12,400
We just need to figure out
what he's after.

737
00:54:12,572 --> 00:54:13,981
With respect, Master Wayne...

738
00:54:14,157 --> 00:54:17,109
...perhaps this is a man
you don't fully understand either.

739
00:54:17,911 --> 00:54:20,614
A long time ago, I was in Burma...

740
00:54:20,789 --> 00:54:24,203
...and my friends and I were working
for the local government.

741
00:54:24,376 --> 00:54:26,948
They were trying to buy
the loyalty of tribal leaders...

742
00:54:27,128 --> 00:54:29,962
...by bribing them with
precious stones...

743
00:54:30,131 --> 00:54:34,708
...but their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.

744
00:54:34,886 --> 00:54:38,170
So we went looking for the stones.

745
00:54:38,556 --> 00:54:43,679
But in six months, we never
met anyone who traded with him.

746
00:54:44,312 --> 00:54:48,308
One day, I saw a child
playing with a ruby...

747
00:54:48,483 --> 00:54:51,518
...the size of a tangerine.

748
00:54:51,778 --> 00:54:55,145
The bandit had been
throwing them away.

749
00:54:55,823 --> 00:54:58,526
- So why steal them?
- Because he thought it was good sport.

750
00:54:58,701 --> 00:55:03,657
Because some men aren't looking
for anything logical, like money.

751
00:55:03,831 --> 00:55:08,076
They can't be bought, bullied,
reasoned or negotiated with.

752
00:55:08,503 --> 00:55:12,333
Some men just wanna
watch the world burn.

753
00:55:32,776 --> 00:55:33,937
Your name, sir?

754
00:55:34,111 --> 00:55:37,276
Eighth and Orchard.
You'll find Harvey Dent there.

755
00:55:50,169 --> 00:55:51,626
Check the names.

756
00:55:58,218 --> 00:55:59,924
"Richard Dent."

757
00:56:02,139 --> 00:56:03,217
"Patrick Harvey."

758
00:56:03,515 --> 00:56:04,545
Harvey Dent.

759
00:56:04,725 --> 00:56:07,724
I need 10 minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it.

760
00:56:07,936 --> 00:56:10,141
It's because of you
these guys are dead...

761
00:56:10,313 --> 00:56:11,854
Detective!

762
00:56:14,067 --> 00:56:16,105
Give us a minute, guys.

763
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,896
That's brick underneath.

764
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:20,897
Gonna take ballistics
off a shattered bullet?

765
00:56:21,074 --> 00:56:22,697
No.

766
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,068
Fingerprints.

767
00:56:34,629 --> 00:56:36,537
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

768
00:56:38,341 --> 00:56:43,048
Because we found his next target.
He's put it in tomorrow's paper.

769
00:57:00,363 --> 00:57:02,650
I'm not sure
you made it loud enough, sir.

770
00:57:15,753 --> 00:57:17,874
What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?

771
00:57:18,047 --> 00:57:21,829
You wanted me to do the diligence
on the LSI Holdings deal again.

772
00:57:22,509 --> 00:57:24,796
Well, I found some irregularities.

773
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:27,294
Their CEO is in police custody.

774
00:57:27,473 --> 00:57:30,389
No, not with their numbers, with yours.

775
00:57:30,601 --> 00:57:33,684
Applied Sciences. Whole division
of Wayne Enterprises...

776
00:57:33,854 --> 00:57:35,512
...just disappeared overnight.

777
00:57:35,689 --> 00:57:39,934
I went down to the archives
and I started pulling some old files.

778
00:57:41,069 --> 00:57:42,941
Don't tell me you didn't
recognize your baby...

779
00:57:43,113 --> 00:57:46,730
...pancaking cop cars
on the evening news.

780
00:57:47,034 --> 00:57:50,236
Now you got the entire R & D
Department burning through cash...

781
00:57:50,412 --> 00:57:53,744
...claiming it's related to
cell phones for the Army?

782
00:57:53,915 --> 00:57:56,998
What are you building for him now,
a rocket ship?

783
00:57:58,879 --> 00:58:00,621
I want...

784
00:58:00,797 --> 00:58:04,710
...$ 10 million a year
for the rest of my life.

785
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:09,341
Let me get this straight.

786
00:58:10,557 --> 00:58:13,011
You think that your client...

787
00:58:13,184 --> 00:58:16,267
One of the wealthiest,
most powerful men in the world...

788
00:58:16,438 --> 00:58:18,014
...is secretly a vigilante...

789
00:58:18,189 --> 00:58:22,849
...who spends his nights beating
criminals to a pulp with his bare hands...

790
00:58:23,027 --> 00:58:26,192
...and your plan
is to blackmail this person?

791
00:58:33,662 --> 00:58:34,941
Good luck.

792
00:58:37,833 --> 00:58:39,242
When...

793
00:58:40,669 --> 00:58:42,126
Keep that.

794
00:58:48,802 --> 00:58:51,256
This is your original scan.

795
00:58:52,681 --> 00:58:54,968
Here it is reengineered.

796
00:59:03,191 --> 00:59:06,724
And there's the thumbprint he left
when he pushed the round in the clip.

797
00:59:08,738 --> 00:59:09,899
I'll get you a copy.

798
00:59:10,114 --> 00:59:13,896
Mr. Wayne, did you reassign R & D?

799
00:59:14,077 --> 00:59:16,566
Yeah. Government
telecommunications project.

800
00:59:16,746 --> 00:59:18,784
Wasn't aware
we had any government contracts.

801
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,039
You know, Lucius, I'm playing this one
pretty close to the chest.

802
00:59:23,169 --> 00:59:24,875
Fair enough.

803
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:29,255
With no word
from the Batman...

804
00:59:29,425 --> 00:59:30,918
...even as they mourn
Commissioner Loeb...

805
00:59:31,093 --> 00:59:34,460
...these cops have to wonder if
the Joker will make good on his threat...

806
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:37,841
...in the obituary column of
The Gotham Times to kill the mayor.

807
00:59:39,643 --> 00:59:43,307
I've checked all the databases.
There are four possibles.

808
00:59:43,481 --> 00:59:45,602
Cross-reference the addresses.

809
00:59:45,774 --> 00:59:49,770
Look for Parkside,
overlooking the parade.

810
00:59:50,988 --> 00:59:52,101
I got one.

811
00:59:52,281 --> 00:59:56,277
Melvin White,
1502 Randolph Apartments.

812
00:59:56,660 --> 01:00:00,739
Aggravated assault,
moved to Arkham twice.

813
01:00:39,828 --> 01:00:41,404
What do you got on the roof?

814
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:45,112
We're tight, but frankly,
there's a lot of windows up here.

815
01:00:53,675 --> 01:00:57,718
Commissioner Loeb dedicated his life
to law enforcement...

816
01:00:57,887 --> 01:01:00,174
...and to the protection
of his community.

817
01:01:00,348 --> 01:01:02,138
I remember when I first took office...

818
01:01:02,308 --> 01:01:04,844
...and I asked if he wanted
to stay on as commissioner.

819
01:01:05,019 --> 01:01:10,260
And he said he would, provided
I kept my politics out of his office.

820
01:01:14,028 --> 01:01:17,193
Clearly he was not a man who minced
words, nor should he have been.

821
01:01:18,366 --> 01:01:21,864
A number of policies that he enacted
as commissioner were unpopular.

822
01:01:22,036 --> 01:01:25,285
Policies that flooded my office
with angry calls and letters...

823
01:01:29,668 --> 01:01:31,326
- Who's that?
- What happened?

824
01:01:32,379 --> 01:01:34,251
They took our guns.

825
01:01:34,423 --> 01:01:36,213
And our uniforms.

826
01:01:42,806 --> 01:01:45,556
And as we recognize
the sacrifice of this man...

827
01:01:45,726 --> 01:01:49,674
...we must remember that vigilance
is the price of safety.

828
01:01:49,855 --> 01:01:52,344
Stand by. Honor guard.

829
01:01:52,524 --> 01:01:56,141
Attention. Port arms.

830
01:01:57,362 --> 01:02:01,738
Ready! Aim! Fire!

831
01:02:02,534 --> 01:02:04,075
Ready! Aim!

832
01:02:07,706 --> 01:02:10,077
Ready! Aim!

833
01:02:18,508 --> 01:02:19,917
Stay down! Don't move!

834
01:02:21,761 --> 01:02:23,419
Mr. Mayor. Get him out of here.

835
01:02:32,647 --> 01:02:34,887
- I'll see you later.
- Why are you going back?

836
01:02:47,537 --> 01:02:48,567
Get out of here.

837
01:02:52,625 --> 01:02:54,367
Tell me what you know about the Joker.

838
01:03:25,407 --> 01:03:26,734
No.

839
01:03:27,159 --> 01:03:28,486
I'm sorry, Barbara.

840
01:03:29,411 --> 01:03:32,660
Jimmy, go play with your sister.
Go ahead, honey.

841
01:03:32,831 --> 01:03:35,071
If there's anything
we can do, anything you need...

842
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:36,992
...we're here for you.

843
01:03:38,587 --> 01:03:40,495
Shh.

844
01:03:40,672 --> 01:03:41,915
Are you out there?

845
01:03:43,258 --> 01:03:47,753
Are you? You brought this
craziness on us. You did!

846
01:03:47,930 --> 01:03:50,301
You brought this on us!

847
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:55,927
Switch it off, he ain't coming.
He doesn't wanna talk to us.

848
01:03:56,355 --> 01:03:59,354
God help whoever
he does wanna talk to.

849
01:04:01,026 --> 01:04:03,942
Can't we go someplace quieter?
We can't hear each other talk.

850
01:04:04,112 --> 01:04:06,946
What makes you think
I wanna hear you talk?

851
01:04:07,115 --> 01:04:08,145
What?

852
01:04:37,562 --> 01:04:39,185
- Yeah?
Second.

853
01:04:39,355 --> 01:04:40,385
Okay.

854
01:04:40,565 --> 01:04:42,722
- Harvey, where are you?
Where are you?

855
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:45,021
I'm where you should be,
at Major Crimes.

856
01:04:45,194 --> 01:04:46,735
I'm trying to deal with all of this mess.

857
01:04:46,904 --> 01:04:50,485
- Can I get the fingerprint analysis?
- Rachel, listen. You're not safe there.

858
01:04:50,658 --> 01:04:52,448
- This is Gordon's unit.
- Gordon 's gone.

859
01:04:52,618 --> 01:04:56,199
He vouched for these men.
- And he's gone.

860
01:05:00,835 --> 01:05:02,909
The Joker's named you next.

861
01:05:03,087 --> 01:05:06,086
God, is there someone, is there anyone
in this town we can trust?

862
01:05:06,257 --> 01:05:07,963
Bruce.

863
01:05:08,259 --> 01:05:09,420
We can trust Bruce Wayne.

864
01:05:09,593 --> 01:05:11,169
No. Rachel, I know
you're his friend, but...

865
01:05:11,345 --> 01:05:13,170
Harvey, trust me.

866
01:05:13,347 --> 01:05:16,097
Bruce's penthouse is now
the safest place in the city.

867
01:05:16,267 --> 01:05:17,594
Then you go straight there.

868
01:05:17,768 --> 01:05:19,889
Don 't tell anybody
and I'll find you there.

869
01:05:20,062 --> 01:05:21,768
I love you.

870
01:05:35,786 --> 01:05:37,029
I want the Joker.

871
01:05:38,247 --> 01:05:39,905
From one professional to another...

872
01:05:40,082 --> 01:05:42,618
...you're trying to scare somebody,
pick a better spot.

873
01:05:42,793 --> 01:05:45,365
From this height,
the fall wouldn't kill me.

874
01:05:45,545 --> 01:05:47,121
- I'm counting on it.
- Huh!

875
01:05:54,513 --> 01:05:57,631
- Where is he?
- I don't know where he is. He found us.

876
01:05:57,807 --> 01:05:59,086
He must have friends.

877
01:05:59,434 --> 01:06:01,721
Friends? Have you met this guy?

878
01:06:01,895 --> 01:06:03,471
Someone knows where he is.

879
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:06,136
Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.

880
01:06:06,316 --> 01:06:07,643
They're wise to your act.

881
01:06:07,817 --> 01:06:11,813
You got rules.
The Joker, he's got no rules.

882
01:06:11,988 --> 01:06:16,862
Nobody's gonna cross him for you.
If you want this guy, you got one way.

883
01:06:17,035 --> 01:06:18,825
But you already know what that is.

884
01:06:18,995 --> 01:06:21,781
Just take off that mask,
let him come find you.

885
01:06:23,416 --> 01:06:27,495
Or you can let a couple more people
get killed while you make up your mind.

886
01:06:29,172 --> 01:06:31,163
You wanna play games?

887
01:06:37,472 --> 01:06:38,502
How's that feel?

888
01:06:38,681 --> 01:06:41,301
- You wouldn't.
- I wouldn't!

889
01:06:42,810 --> 01:06:44,433
- You don't think I will?
- Mm-mm.

890
01:06:44,604 --> 01:06:46,642
- You don't think I will?
- Mm-mm.

891
01:06:48,024 --> 01:06:51,226
No. No, I wouldn't.

892
01:06:52,445 --> 01:06:54,981
That's why I'm not
gonna leave it up to me.

893
01:06:55,990 --> 01:06:58,989
Heads, you get to keep your head.

894
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:01,033
Tails...

895
01:07:01,996 --> 01:07:03,026
...not so lucky.

896
01:07:03,414 --> 01:07:06,947
So you wanna tell me about the Joker?

897
01:07:16,343 --> 01:07:20,042
- Let's go again.
- I don't know anything! God, don't!

898
01:07:20,222 --> 01:07:22,593
You're not playing the odds, friend.

899
01:07:23,725 --> 01:07:25,716
Let's do it again.

900
01:07:28,564 --> 01:07:30,389
You'd leave a man's life to chance?

901
01:07:31,149 --> 01:07:34,730
- Not exactly.
- His name's Schiff, Thomas.

902
01:07:34,903 --> 01:07:37,902
He's a paranoid schizophrenic,
former patient at Arkham.

903
01:07:38,073 --> 01:07:42,698
The kind of mind the Joker attracts.
What do you expect to learn from him?

904
01:07:46,039 --> 01:07:48,825
The Joker killed Gordon.
He's gonna kill Rachel.

905
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,786
You're the symbol of hope
I could never be.

906
01:07:51,962 --> 01:07:53,787
Your stand against organized crime...

907
01:07:53,964 --> 01:07:57,166
...is the first legitimate ray of light
in Gotham in decades.

908
01:07:57,342 --> 01:08:00,959
If anyone saw this,
everything would be undone.

909
01:08:01,136 --> 01:08:03,423
The criminals you arrested
would be released...

910
01:08:03,597 --> 01:08:06,680
...and Jim Gordon
will have died for nothing.

911
01:08:07,309 --> 01:08:09,549
You're gonna hold
a press conference tomorrow.

912
01:08:09,728 --> 01:08:12,099
- Why?
- No one else will die because of me.

913
01:08:12,272 --> 01:08:14,596
Gotham's in your hands now.

914
01:08:14,775 --> 01:08:16,481
You can't.

915
01:08:16,651 --> 01:08:18,025
You can't give in.

916
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,856
You can't give in!

917
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:37,455
Harvey called.

918
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:40,665
He said Batman's gonna turn himself in.

919
01:08:40,842 --> 01:08:41,955
I have no choice.

920
01:08:42,135 --> 01:08:45,218
You honestly think that's gonna
keep the Joker from killing people?

921
01:08:45,388 --> 01:08:48,838
Maybe not. But I have enough blood
on my hands.

922
01:08:49,309 --> 01:08:54,135
And I've seen now what I would
have to become to stop men like him.

923
01:08:54,689 --> 01:08:58,139
You once told me that
if the day came when I was finished...

924
01:08:58,318 --> 01:09:00,392
...that we'd be together.

925
01:09:01,112 --> 01:09:04,277
Bruce, don't make me
your one hope for a normal life.

926
01:09:05,825 --> 01:09:07,152
Did you mean it?

927
01:09:08,661 --> 01:09:10,486
Yes.

928
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:29,553
Bruce.

929
01:09:30,516 --> 01:09:34,429
If you turn yourself in,
they're not gonna let us be together.

930
01:09:45,072 --> 01:09:48,024
Logs as well?
Everything.

931
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:51,567
Anything that could lead back
to Lucius or Rachel.

932
01:09:56,917 --> 01:10:00,201
People are dying, Alfred.
What would you have me do?

933
01:10:00,379 --> 01:10:04,126
Endure, Master Wayne. Take it.

934
01:10:04,299 --> 01:10:07,998
They'll hate you for it,
but that's the point of Batman.

935
01:10:08,178 --> 01:10:13,716
He can be the outcast. He can make
the choice that no one else can make.

936
01:10:13,892 --> 01:10:15,219
The right choice.

937
01:10:15,727 --> 01:10:18,762
No, today I found out
what Batman can't do.

938
01:10:18,939 --> 01:10:20,182
He can't endure this.

939
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:23,351
Today you get to say "I told you so."

940
01:10:23,943 --> 01:10:27,108
Today, I don't want to.

941
01:10:32,952 --> 01:10:34,409
But I did bloody tell you.

942
01:10:37,457 --> 01:10:40,456
I suppose they're gonna
lock me up as well...

943
01:10:41,252 --> 01:10:42,495
...as your accomplice.

944
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:47,414
Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them
the whole thing was your idea.

945
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:55,212
Ladies and gentlemen, I've called
this press conference for two reasons.

946
01:10:55,391 --> 01:10:57,429
Firstly, to assure the citizens
of Gotham...

947
01:10:57,602 --> 01:11:01,266
...that everything that can be done
over the Joker killings is being done.

948
01:11:02,648 --> 01:11:05,731
Secondly, because the Batman
has offered to turn himself in.

949
01:11:05,901 --> 01:11:07,607
But let's consider the situation.

950
01:11:07,987 --> 01:11:10,607
Should we give in
to this terrorist's demands?

951
01:11:10,781 --> 01:11:12,238
Do we really think he's gonna...?

952
01:11:12,408 --> 01:11:15,775
You'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante
than the lives of citizens?

953
01:11:15,953 --> 01:11:18,324
The Batman is an outlaw.

954
01:11:19,206 --> 01:11:21,114
That's not why we demand
he turn himself in...

955
01:11:21,292 --> 01:11:22,950
...we're doing it because we're scared.

956
01:11:23,127 --> 01:11:25,913
We've been happy to let Batman
clean up our streets till now.

957
01:11:26,088 --> 01:11:29,040
Things are worse than ever!
Amen.

958
01:11:30,384 --> 01:11:32,292
Yes, they are.

959
01:11:34,805 --> 01:11:37,804
But the night is darkest
just before the dawn.

960
01:11:40,269 --> 01:11:42,343
And I promise you...

961
01:11:43,146 --> 01:11:44,555
...the dawn is coming.

962
01:11:44,731 --> 01:11:49,272
One day, the Batman will have to answer
for the laws he's broken. But to us...

963
01:11:49,444 --> 01:11:51,186
...not to this madman.

964
01:11:51,363 --> 01:11:53,687
- No more dead cops!
Yeah!

965
01:11:56,993 --> 01:11:58,569
He should turn himself in!

966
01:11:58,745 --> 01:12:01,448
Give us the Batman! Come on!
Where is he?

967
01:12:04,334 --> 01:12:06,491
So be it. Take the Batman into custody.

968
01:12:06,962 --> 01:12:08,918
What?
Is he here?

969
01:12:09,631 --> 01:12:10,661
I am the Batman.

970
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:14,006
What?
Come on.

971
01:12:22,393 --> 01:12:24,301
Alfred.

972
01:12:25,647 --> 01:12:27,437
Why is he letting Harvey do this?

973
01:12:27,607 --> 01:12:30,606
- He went down to the press conference.
- I know. He just stood by.

974
01:12:30,777 --> 01:12:32,851
Perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent...

975
01:12:33,029 --> 01:12:36,028
...believe that Batman stands for
something more important...

976
01:12:36,199 --> 01:12:38,523
...than the whims of a terrorist,
Miss Dawes...

977
01:12:38,701 --> 01:12:40,692
...even if everyone hates him for it.

978
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:42,991
That's the sacrifice he's making.

979
01:12:43,164 --> 01:12:46,781
He's not being a hero.
He's being something more.

980
01:12:47,335 --> 01:12:48,958
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

981
01:12:49,128 --> 01:12:52,211
Letting Harvey take the fall for this
is not heroic at all.

982
01:12:54,884 --> 01:12:56,507
You know him better than anyone.

983
01:12:56,927 --> 01:12:57,957
I do.

984
01:13:01,348 --> 01:13:04,383
Will you give this to him for me?
When the time is right?

985
01:13:05,853 --> 01:13:07,050
How will I know?

986
01:13:07,229 --> 01:13:08,722
It's not sealed.

987
01:13:10,149 --> 01:13:11,690
Goodbye, Alfred.

988
01:13:15,863 --> 01:13:17,605
Bye, Rachel.

989
01:13:25,497 --> 01:13:27,322
I didn't have time to talk this through.

990
01:13:27,499 --> 01:13:28,742
What are you doing?

991
01:13:28,917 --> 01:13:30,991
They're transferring me
to Central Holding.

992
01:13:31,295 --> 01:13:34,959
This is the Joker's chance, and when he
attacks, the Batman will take him down.

993
01:13:35,132 --> 01:13:36,673
Listen. This is too dangerous.

994
01:13:36,842 --> 01:13:40,541
We get this guy to County, he's their
problem. The streets will be cleared...

995
01:13:40,721 --> 01:13:44,420
...so let's go.
The convoys stop for no reason.

996
01:13:44,599 --> 01:13:46,056
I hope you got some moves, pal.

997
01:13:46,226 --> 01:13:49,142
He's using you as bait. He doesn't
know if he can get the Joker.

998
01:13:49,312 --> 01:13:50,390
He's failed so far.

999
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:52,271
How do you know
what he's thinking?

1000
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,764
I just do. Anyway,
this isn't just about you.

1001
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:56,768
What about the people
depending on you...

1002
01:13:56,945 --> 01:13:59,944
...to clean the city up
and do it honorably and...?

1003
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:08,240
Harvey. Tell everyone the truth.

1004
01:14:08,623 --> 01:14:10,495
Heads, I go through with it.

1005
01:14:10,708 --> 01:14:12,616
This is your life. You can't leave...

1006
01:14:12,794 --> 01:14:15,165
...something like that to chance.
- I'm not.

1007
01:14:19,509 --> 01:14:21,915
You make your own luck.

1008
01:14:43,741 --> 01:14:45,732
Hey, you wait like everybody else, pal.

1009
01:14:53,375 --> 01:14:55,699
What the hell is that?

1010
01:14:55,878 --> 01:14:58,083
Obstruction ahead, obstruction ahead!

1011
01:14:58,255 --> 01:15:01,457
Damn it! All units divert down
onto Lower Fifth. I repeat, exit down.

1012
01:15:01,884 --> 01:15:02,997
Exit down!

1013
01:15:03,177 --> 01:15:05,501
Lower Fifth? We'll be
like turkeys on Thanksgiving.

1014
01:15:38,211 --> 01:15:40,535
Jesus. Come on, get us out of here.
Let's go.

1015
01:15:42,716 --> 01:15:45,087
Listen, we need backup.
We've got company.

1016
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:46,801
We got trouble, guys.

1017
01:15:49,723 --> 01:15:50,801
Lock and load!

1018
01:16:02,026 --> 01:16:03,400
The hell was that?

1019
01:16:25,258 --> 01:16:27,926
- These are built for that, right?
- He'll need something...

1020
01:16:28,094 --> 01:16:29,884
...a lot bigger to get through this.

1021
01:16:30,930 --> 01:16:32,387
What is that?

1022
01:16:33,724 --> 01:16:35,051
What is that, a bazooka?

1023
01:16:43,692 --> 01:16:45,398
I didn't sign up for this!

1024
01:17:01,752 --> 01:17:03,079
Look out.

1025
01:17:03,879 --> 01:17:05,040
Look out!

1026
01:17:13,347 --> 01:17:14,377
Hmm.

1027
01:17:27,319 --> 01:17:28,432
Come on, let's go!

1028
01:18:15,163 --> 01:18:17,369
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent.

1029
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:20,375
Oh, excuse me. I wanna drive.

1030
01:18:25,298 --> 01:18:28,880
Scanning all systems.
Scanning all systems.

1031
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:38,472
We gotta get topside.
We need air support, now!

1032
01:18:43,983 --> 01:18:45,856
I like this job. I like it.

1033
01:18:48,112 --> 01:18:50,733
Damage catastrophic.
Eject sequence initiated.

1034
01:19:04,711 --> 01:19:06,205
Goodbye.

1035
01:19:15,305 --> 01:19:18,508
We're on point, ready to give them
some of their own medicine.

1036
01:19:24,898 --> 01:19:27,353
That's what I'm talking about. Air cav.

1037
01:19:40,914 --> 01:19:42,621
Okay, rack them up.

1038
01:19:42,791 --> 01:19:45,163
Rack them up, rack them up,
rack them up.

1039
01:20:10,902 --> 01:20:12,064
That's not good.

1040
01:20:15,573 --> 01:20:16,771
Okay, that's not good!

1041
01:20:59,908 --> 01:21:01,984
Now, there's a Batman.

1042
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:07,488
Ooh, you wanna play. Come on.

1043
01:21:10,419 --> 01:21:11,533
Come on.

1044
01:21:20,679 --> 01:21:21,923
He missed!

1045
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:38,267
You can't stop here.
We're like sitting ducks!

1046
01:21:55,296 --> 01:21:56,375
Come on, come on.

1047
01:21:59,509 --> 01:22:02,877
Come on. Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on!

1048
01:22:05,431 --> 01:22:06,889
Come on.

1049
01:22:07,558 --> 01:22:10,891
Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on, hit me.

1050
01:22:11,062 --> 01:22:12,686
Come on, hit me. Come on, hit me!

1051
01:22:14,815 --> 01:22:15,846
Hit me!

1052
01:22:40,841 --> 01:22:44,091
Come on, come on. Aah!

1053
01:22:44,261 --> 01:22:46,502
Could you please just give me a minute?

1054
01:22:48,599 --> 01:22:50,425
We got you, you son of a bitch.

1055
01:22:53,729 --> 01:22:57,643
Gor... You do like to play things
pretty close to the chest.

1056
01:22:58,108 --> 01:22:59,815
We got him, Harvey.

1057
01:22:59,985 --> 01:23:03,436
Mr. Dent! How does it feel
to be the biggest hero in Gotham?

1058
01:23:03,613 --> 01:23:06,898
No, I'm no hero.
Gotham's finest, they're the heroes.

1059
01:23:07,075 --> 01:23:08,403
But you and your office...

1060
01:23:08,577 --> 01:23:10,236
...have been working
with the Batman all along.

1061
01:23:10,412 --> 01:23:12,203
No, but I trusted him
to do the right thing.

1062
01:23:12,372 --> 01:23:14,448
Which was?
- Saving my ass.

1063
01:23:14,624 --> 01:23:17,541
All right, people, that's enough.
Let him be. Let him be.

1064
01:23:17,711 --> 01:23:19,620
Thank you, detective.

1065
01:23:19,838 --> 01:23:21,960
I've got a date
with a pretty upset girlfriend.

1066
01:23:22,132 --> 01:23:24,504
- I figured, counselor.
Mr. Dent, sir...

1067
01:23:24,676 --> 01:23:28,804
...how about one for the front page, sir?
Mr. Dent.

1068
01:23:40,149 --> 01:23:43,315
Stand away! All of you!

1069
01:23:43,486 --> 01:23:46,985
I don't want anything for his Mob lawyer
to use, you understand?

1070
01:23:49,242 --> 01:23:51,115
Back from the dead.

1071
01:23:51,786 --> 01:23:53,328
I, uh...

1072
01:23:53,496 --> 01:23:55,405
...couldn't risk my family's safety.

1073
01:23:56,707 --> 01:23:58,533
What do we got?

1074
01:24:00,211 --> 01:24:04,160
Nothing. No matches on prints,
DNA, dental.

1075
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:07,091
Clothing is custom, no labels.

1076
01:24:07,301 --> 01:24:09,423
Nothing in his pockets
but knives and lint.

1077
01:24:09,595 --> 01:24:11,504
No name.

1078
01:24:11,847 --> 01:24:13,804
- No other alias.
Go home, Gordon.

1079
01:24:13,974 --> 01:24:17,058
The clown'll keep till morning.
Go get some rest.

1080
01:24:17,228 --> 01:24:19,054
You're gonna need it.

1081
01:24:19,313 --> 01:24:21,886
Tomorrow you take the big job.

1082
01:24:22,566 --> 01:24:25,732
You don't have any say in the matter.
Commissioner Gordon.

1083
01:24:41,585 --> 01:24:43,707
I'm sorry, I couldn't risk your safety.

1084
01:24:50,218 --> 01:24:51,628
Look at these ugly bastards.

1085
01:24:51,803 --> 01:24:53,676
- I don't feel good.
You're a cop killer.

1086
01:24:53,847 --> 01:24:56,172
You're lucky to be feeling anything
below the neck.

1087
01:24:56,349 --> 01:24:57,926
- Please!
- Step away from the bars!

1088
01:24:58,101 --> 01:25:00,259
My insides hurt.

1089
01:25:14,451 --> 01:25:16,242
Did Batman save you, Daddy?

1090
01:25:18,413 --> 01:25:20,701
Actually, this time...

1091
01:25:20,874 --> 01:25:23,032
...I saved him.

1092
01:25:34,387 --> 01:25:36,011
Has he said anything yet?

1093
01:25:43,604 --> 01:25:47,815
Evening, commissioner.

1094
01:25:55,449 --> 01:25:57,655
Harvey Dent never made it home.

1095
01:25:57,827 --> 01:25:59,949
- Of course not.
- What have you done with him?

1096
01:26:00,871 --> 01:26:02,614
Me?

1097
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:06,372
I was right here.

1098
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:09,621
Who did you leave him with?

1099
01:26:09,797 --> 01:26:12,632
Hm? Your people?

1100
01:26:13,759 --> 01:26:17,092
Assuming, of course,
that they are still your people...

1101
01:26:17,262 --> 01:26:19,966
...and not Maroni's.

1102
01:26:22,184 --> 01:26:24,556
Does it depress you, commissioner...

1103
01:26:24,978 --> 01:26:29,936
...to know just how alone you really are?

1104
01:26:31,944 --> 01:26:36,819
Does it make you feel responsible
for Harvey Dent's current predicament?

1105
01:26:36,990 --> 01:26:39,659
- Where is he?
- What's the time?

1106
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,654
What difference does that make?

1107
01:26:41,912 --> 01:26:47,368
Well, depending on the time,
he may be in one spot or several.

1108
01:26:53,757 --> 01:26:56,710
- lf we're gonna play games...
- Mm-hm?

1109
01:26:59,888 --> 01:27:01,845
...I'm gonna need a cup of coffee.

1110
01:27:02,015 --> 01:27:06,095
Ah, the "good cop, bad cop" routine?

1111
01:27:06,769 --> 01:27:07,800
Not exactly.

1112
01:27:18,323 --> 01:27:22,367
Never start with the head. The victim
gets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next...

1113
01:27:25,538 --> 01:27:26,652
See?

1114
01:27:26,831 --> 01:27:29,156
You wanted me. Here I am.

1115
01:27:30,209 --> 01:27:32,331
I wanted to see what you'd do.

1116
01:27:32,879 --> 01:27:35,452
And you didn't disappoint.

1117
01:27:35,631 --> 01:27:38,466
You let five people die.

1118
01:27:39,427 --> 01:27:43,092
Then you let Dent take your place.

1119
01:27:43,264 --> 01:27:45,885
- Even to a guy like me, that's cold.
- Where's Dent?

1120
01:27:46,058 --> 01:27:50,850
Those Mob fools want you gone so they
can get back to the way things were.

1121
01:27:51,355 --> 01:27:56,100
But I know the truth. There's no
going back. You've changed things.

1122
01:27:56,277 --> 01:27:58,684
- Forever.
- Then why do you wanna kill me?

1123
01:28:01,657 --> 01:28:03,067
I don't wanna kill you.

1124
01:28:03,575 --> 01:28:08,118
What would I do without you? Go back
to ripping off Mob dealers? No, no.

1125
01:28:08,288 --> 01:28:10,660
No. No, you...

1126
01:28:10,833 --> 01:28:13,240
You complete me.

1127
01:28:13,418 --> 01:28:17,747
- You're garbage who kills for money.
- Don't talk like one of them. You're not.

1128
01:28:17,923 --> 01:28:20,330
Even if you'd like to be.

1129
01:28:21,593 --> 01:28:23,419
To them, you're just a freak...

1130
01:28:24,346 --> 01:28:25,674
...like me.

1131
01:28:25,847 --> 01:28:28,135
They need you right now...

1132
01:28:28,725 --> 01:28:30,764
...but when they don't...

1133
01:28:31,311 --> 01:28:34,347
...they'll cast you out like a leper.

1134
01:28:34,523 --> 01:28:38,437
You see, their morals, their code...

1135
01:28:38,693 --> 01:28:40,851
...it's a bad joke.

1136
01:28:41,112 --> 01:28:44,445
Dropped at the first sign of trouble.

1137
01:28:45,116 --> 01:28:49,113
They're only as good as the world
allows them to be. I'll show you.

1138
01:28:49,287 --> 01:28:52,453
When the chips are down, these...

1139
01:28:52,624 --> 01:28:54,865
These civilized people...

1140
01:28:55,043 --> 01:28:57,119
...they'll eat each other.

1141
01:28:57,837 --> 01:29:00,209
See, I'm not a monster.

1142
01:29:01,591 --> 01:29:02,871
I'm just ahead of the curve.

1143
01:29:05,136 --> 01:29:06,215
Where's Dent?

1144
01:29:06,387 --> 01:29:09,304
You have all these rules,
and you think they'll save you.

1145
01:29:12,393 --> 01:29:14,800
- He's in control.
- I have one rule.

1146
01:29:14,979 --> 01:29:18,063
Oh. Then that's the rule you'll have
to break to know the truth.

1147
01:29:18,232 --> 01:29:19,394
Which is?

1148
01:29:19,567 --> 01:29:21,974
The only sensible way to live
is without rules.

1149
01:29:22,153 --> 01:29:24,822
And tonight you're gonna break
your one rule.

1150
01:29:24,989 --> 01:29:26,020
I'm considering it.

1151
01:29:26,198 --> 01:29:28,819
There's only minutes left,
so you'll have to play my game...

1152
01:29:28,993 --> 01:29:31,566
...if you wanna save one of them.

1153
01:29:32,079 --> 01:29:33,110
"Them"?

1154
01:29:33,289 --> 01:29:37,333
You know, for a while there,
I thought you really were Dent.

1155
01:29:37,501 --> 01:29:40,122
The way you threw yourself after her.

1156
01:29:46,427 --> 01:29:47,506
Look at you go.

1157
01:29:53,142 --> 01:29:56,724
Does Harvey know
about you and his little bunny?

1158
01:29:57,646 --> 01:29:59,021
Where are they?!

1159
01:29:59,189 --> 01:30:01,181
Killing is making a choice.

1160
01:30:01,358 --> 01:30:04,442
- Where are they?!
- Choose between one life or the other.

1161
01:30:05,195 --> 01:30:09,441
Your friend the district attorney,
or his blushing bride-to-be.

1162
01:30:14,621 --> 01:30:18,701
You have nothing,
nothing to threaten me with.

1163
01:30:19,126 --> 01:30:22,625
Nothing to do with all your strength.

1164
01:30:22,838 --> 01:30:26,253
Don't worry, I'm gonna tell you
where they are, both of them.

1165
01:30:26,424 --> 01:30:29,460
And that's the point.
You'll have to choose.

1166
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:33,055
He's at 25052nd Street...

1167
01:30:33,223 --> 01:30:36,556
...and she's on Avenue X at Cicero.

1168
01:30:38,645 --> 01:30:40,388
- Which one you going after?
- Rachel.

1169
01:30:41,815 --> 01:30:43,225
We're getting Dent!

1170
01:30:45,485 --> 01:30:48,320
25052nd Street!

1171
01:30:51,241 --> 01:30:53,067
Hello?

1172
01:30:54,035 --> 01:30:56,407
Can anybody hear me?

1173
01:30:58,831 --> 01:31:01,452
Hello!

1174
01:31:05,463 --> 01:31:07,704
- Rachel?
- Harvey.

1175
01:31:07,882 --> 01:31:10,088
Oh, Harvey, thank God. Are you okay?

1176
01:31:10,259 --> 01:31:11,836
I'm all right. I'm in a...

1177
01:31:12,011 --> 01:31:15,593
I'm in a warehouse.
They got me wired to these oil drums.

1178
01:31:16,641 --> 01:31:17,839
I am too.

1179
01:31:18,392 --> 01:31:20,099
Harvey.

1180
01:31:27,359 --> 01:31:29,814
I want my phone call.

1181
01:31:29,987 --> 01:31:32,774
I want it. I want it.
I want my phone call.

1182
01:31:33,449 --> 01:31:35,275
That's nice.

1183
01:31:36,785 --> 01:31:41,612
How many of your friends have I killed?

1184
01:31:45,377 --> 01:31:46,456
I'm a 20-year man...

1185
01:31:46,628 --> 01:31:50,079
...and I know the difference between
punks who need a lesson in manners...

1186
01:31:50,257 --> 01:31:53,127
...and the freaks like you
who would just enjoy it.

1187
01:31:54,011 --> 01:31:56,466
And you killed six of my friends.

1188
01:31:56,638 --> 01:31:57,669
Six?

1189
01:31:57,848 --> 01:32:00,303
Please. My insides hurt.

1190
01:32:00,475 --> 01:32:02,218
I don't really care. Back away.

1191
01:32:02,394 --> 01:32:05,560
The boss said he'd make the voices
go away.

1192
01:32:05,731 --> 01:32:09,265
He said he'd go inside
and replace them with bright lights...

1193
01:32:09,443 --> 01:32:10,557
...like Christmas.

1194
01:32:10,735 --> 01:32:13,272
You're out of your mind, pal. Back off.

1195
01:32:13,446 --> 01:32:16,281
Medic to the holding tank.
Come on. Get the door open.

1196
01:32:16,491 --> 01:32:17,653
You guys, back off!

1197
01:32:17,826 --> 01:32:19,984
Listen, we don't have a lot of time.

1198
01:32:20,161 --> 01:32:24,158
They told me that only one of us
was gonna make it...

1199
01:32:24,332 --> 01:32:27,665
...and that they were gonna
let our friends choose.

1200
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:32,502
Okay, Rachel.

1201
01:32:33,091 --> 01:32:36,210
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be all right.
They're coming for you.

1202
01:32:36,386 --> 01:32:40,679
Listen to me. I'll help you. Just talk me
through what's going on with you.

1203
01:32:40,848 --> 01:32:42,757
Can you find something,
anything, sharp?

1204
01:32:42,934 --> 01:32:44,344
I'm trying.

1205
01:32:44,519 --> 01:32:46,677
- What's...?
- Shit.

1206
01:32:46,854 --> 01:32:48,348
Harvey?

1207
01:32:52,110 --> 01:32:53,769
Harvey, what's happening?

1208
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:06,951
All available units,
converge at 25052nd Street.

1209
01:33:07,291 --> 01:33:11,371
Do you wanna know why I use a knife?

1210
01:33:13,672 --> 01:33:15,000
Guns are too quick.

1211
01:33:15,174 --> 01:33:18,542
You can't savor all the...

1212
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:22,052
...little emotions.

1213
01:33:23,974 --> 01:33:28,849
You see, in their last moments...

1214
01:33:29,021 --> 01:33:31,309
...people show you who they really are.

1215
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:38,069
So in a way, I knew your friends
better than you ever did.

1216
01:33:41,825 --> 01:33:45,240
Would you like to know
which of them were cowards?

1217
01:33:51,752 --> 01:33:53,411
What's that?
Jeez.

1218
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:55,667
He's got some kind of a...

1219
01:33:55,839 --> 01:33:59,042
...contusion.
- I know you're gonna enjoy this.

1220
01:34:00,427 --> 01:34:04,175
I'm gonna have to try and enjoy it
even more.

1221
01:34:09,394 --> 01:34:10,674
Whoa, whoa!

1222
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:12,761
Just put it down.

1223
01:34:12,939 --> 01:34:15,726
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Drop the weapon now!

1224
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:19,849
- It's my own damn fault, just shoot him!
- Let him go now! Drop it!

1225
01:34:20,155 --> 01:34:23,155
- What? Sorry?
- What do you want?

1226
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:26,109
I just want my phone call.

1227
01:34:29,122 --> 01:34:31,791
What...? What...? What's happening?

1228
01:34:31,958 --> 01:34:34,793
Just talk to me, just for one second.

1229
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:39,799
- All right?
- Right.

1230
01:34:41,717 --> 01:34:43,127
Ow.

1231
01:34:44,053 --> 01:34:45,630
- Ow.
- Shh, shh, shh.

1232
01:34:51,602 --> 01:34:53,641
Is that a phone?

1233
01:35:03,322 --> 01:35:04,650
Mount the curb!

1234
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:16,662
Harvey, just in case,
I wanna tell you something, okay?

1235
01:35:16,835 --> 01:35:18,626
Don 't think like that. They're coming.

1236
01:35:18,796 --> 01:35:21,084
I know they are,
but I don't want them to.

1237
01:35:25,511 --> 01:35:29,591
I don't wanna live without you,
and I do have an answer for you.

1238
01:35:30,015 --> 01:35:31,758
My answer is yes.

1239
01:35:34,519 --> 01:35:37,270
No! No! No!

1240
01:35:37,439 --> 01:35:40,060
Not me! Why are you coming for me?

1241
01:35:40,233 --> 01:35:41,264
No!

1242
01:35:42,944 --> 01:35:44,521
Rachel! Rachel!

1243
01:35:44,738 --> 01:35:47,063
- Harvey.
- No! No! Rachel!

1244
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:48,271
Okay.

1245
01:35:48,450 --> 01:35:49,529
Rachel!

1246
01:35:49,951 --> 01:35:51,493
No! No!

1247
01:35:51,661 --> 01:35:55,789
Harvey, it's okay. It's all right. Listen.

1248
01:35:55,957 --> 01:35:57,285
Somewh...

1249
01:36:03,173 --> 01:36:04,371
No, commissioner!

1250
01:36:04,549 --> 01:36:07,218
Rachel! No!

1251
01:36:21,566 --> 01:36:22,680
Hello there.

1252
01:36:28,573 --> 01:36:32,072
Back at the MCU, the Joker's gone.

1253
01:36:32,994 --> 01:36:34,701
With Lau?

1254
01:36:37,498 --> 01:36:40,071
The Joker planned to be caught.

1255
01:36:40,418 --> 01:36:42,576
He wanted me to lock him up
in the MCU.

1256
01:37:02,231 --> 01:37:04,270
Dear Bruce:

1257
01:37:06,026 --> 01:37:08,563
I need to be honest and clear.

1258
01:37:10,614 --> 01:37:13,151
I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.

1259
01:37:13,325 --> 01:37:17,239
I love him, and I wanna spend
the rest of my life with him.

1260
01:37:17,788 --> 01:37:22,200
When I told you that if Gotham no longer
needed Batman, we could be together...

1261
01:37:22,376 --> 01:37:24,582
... I meant it.

1262
01:37:24,836 --> 01:37:29,581
But now I'm sure the day won 't come
when you no longer need Batman.

1263
01:37:30,634 --> 01:37:32,543
I hope it does.

1264
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:35,470
And if it does, I will be there...

1265
01:37:36,014 --> 01:37:37,424
... but as your friend.

1266
01:37:38,141 --> 01:37:40,382
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1267
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:42,932
I'm sorry to let you down.

1268
01:37:43,104 --> 01:37:48,098
If you lose your faith in me,
please keep your faith in people.

1269
01:37:48,693 --> 01:37:53,105
Love, now and always, Rachel.

1270
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:03,405
Prepared a little breakfast.

1271
01:38:07,545 --> 01:38:09,454
- Very well, then.
- Alfred.

1272
01:38:09,631 --> 01:38:10,793
Yes, Master Wayne?

1273
01:38:12,175 --> 01:38:14,416
Did I bring this on her?

1274
01:38:15,470 --> 01:38:17,676
I was meant to inspire good...

1275
01:38:17,847 --> 01:38:20,219
...not madness, not death.

1276
01:38:20,391 --> 01:38:25,017
You have inspired good. But you spat
in the faces of Gotham's criminals.

1277
01:38:25,187 --> 01:38:27,263
Didn't you think
there might be casualties?

1278
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:29,847
Things always get worse
before they get better.

1279
01:38:30,192 --> 01:38:31,650
But Rachel, Alfred.

1280
01:38:31,819 --> 01:38:35,602
Rachel believed in what you stood for...

1281
01:38:35,781 --> 01:38:37,690
...what we stand for.

1282
01:38:37,867 --> 01:38:39,325
Gotham needs you.

1283
01:38:39,869 --> 01:38:42,822
No, Gotham needs its true hero...

1284
01:38:43,330 --> 01:38:47,458
...and I let that murdering psychopath
blow him half to hell.

1285
01:38:47,626 --> 01:38:49,951
Which is why, for now...

1286
01:38:50,754 --> 01:38:52,663
...they're gonna have to
make do with you.

1287
01:38:54,883 --> 01:38:56,709
She was gonna wait for me, Alfred.

1288
01:38:58,721 --> 01:39:00,760
Dent doesn't know.

1289
01:39:00,931 --> 01:39:02,211
He can never know.

1290
01:39:04,643 --> 01:39:06,267
What's that?

1291
01:39:06,436 --> 01:39:09,389
- It can wait.
- That bandit...

1292
01:39:09,856 --> 01:39:11,978
...in the forest in Burma.

1293
01:39:12,150 --> 01:39:14,189
- Did you catch him?
- Yes.

1294
01:39:14,361 --> 01:39:15,689
How?

1295
01:39:17,114 --> 01:39:18,738
We burned the forest down.

1296
01:39:57,987 --> 01:40:00,608
He's credible, an M & A lawyer
from a leading consultancy.

1297
01:40:00,782 --> 01:40:04,150
He says he's waited as long as he can
for Batman to do the right thing.

1298
01:40:04,327 --> 01:40:06,403
Now he's taking matters
into his own hands.

1299
01:40:06,579 --> 01:40:09,532
We'll be live at 5 with
the true identity of the Batman.

1300
01:40:25,973 --> 01:40:27,597
I'm sorry about Rachel.

1301
01:40:30,311 --> 01:40:35,138
The doctor says you're in agonizing pain,
but that you won't accept medication.

1302
01:40:36,191 --> 01:40:38,148
That you're refusing to...

1303
01:40:38,319 --> 01:40:40,062
...accept skin grafts.

1304
01:40:40,404 --> 01:40:42,645
Remember that name...

1305
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:45,565
...you all had for me...

1306
01:40:46,035 --> 01:40:48,870
...when I was at Internal Affairs?

1307
01:40:51,331 --> 01:40:52,611
What was it, Gordon?

1308
01:40:53,292 --> 01:40:54,667
Harvey, I...

1309
01:40:54,835 --> 01:40:56,329
Say it.

1310
01:40:57,754 --> 01:40:59,663
Say it!

1311
01:41:07,347 --> 01:41:10,431
Two-Face. Harvey Two-Face.

1312
01:41:12,018 --> 01:41:16,311
Why should I hide who I am?

1313
01:41:17,524 --> 01:41:18,852
I know you tried to warn me.

1314
01:41:19,734 --> 01:41:20,932
I'm sorry.

1315
01:41:21,569 --> 01:41:24,190
Wuertz picked you up.
Was he working for them?

1316
01:41:26,491 --> 01:41:28,863
Do you know who picked up Rachel?

1317
01:41:29,703 --> 01:41:32,703
Harvey, I need to know
which of my men I can trust.

1318
01:41:33,081 --> 01:41:35,203
Why would you listen to me now?

1319
01:41:36,334 --> 01:41:37,993
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1320
01:41:40,547 --> 01:41:42,338
No.

1321
01:41:42,799 --> 01:41:44,921
No, you're not.

1322
01:41:45,969 --> 01:41:47,213
Not yet.

1323
01:41:52,475 --> 01:41:55,179
This craziness, it's too much.

1324
01:41:55,394 --> 01:41:58,644
Should've thought about that
before you let the clown out of the box.

1325
01:41:58,815 --> 01:42:00,558
MARONl:
You want him?

1326
01:42:03,027 --> 01:42:05,352
I can tell you
where he'll be this afternoon.

1327
01:42:13,412 --> 01:42:15,700
Not so crazy as you look.

1328
01:42:15,873 --> 01:42:19,621
I told you, I'm a man of my word.

1329
01:42:22,838 --> 01:42:24,082
Where is the Italian?

1330
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:27,375
All tactical units will converge
on the location in 20 minutes.

1331
01:42:27,551 --> 01:42:31,002
I want auxiliary units to cover
all possible getaway routes.

1332
01:42:31,597 --> 01:42:32,759
Please.

1333
01:42:32,931 --> 01:42:36,264
Joker-man, what you do
with all your money?

1334
01:42:36,935 --> 01:42:39,604
You see, I'm a guy of simple taste.

1335
01:42:39,771 --> 01:42:41,430
I enjoy...

1336
01:42:41,607 --> 01:42:42,982
...dynamite...

1337
01:42:43,150 --> 01:42:44,692
...and gunpowder...

1338
01:42:45,152 --> 01:42:47,559
...and gasoline.

1339
01:42:49,031 --> 01:42:51,272
- What the...?
- Ah, ah, ah.

1340
01:42:53,118 --> 01:42:55,953
And you know the thing
that they have in common?

1341
01:42:56,455 --> 01:42:57,735
They're cheap.

1342
01:42:57,914 --> 01:43:00,583
How much are they
paying you to say who Batman is?

1343
01:43:00,750 --> 01:43:04,699
This is our chance. I want Lau alive.
The Joker, either way.

1344
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,290
Hey, Jim. Get a load of this.

1345
01:43:06,464 --> 01:43:07,792
Let's take the next caller.

1346
01:43:07,966 --> 01:43:10,124
Harvey Dent didn 't wanna
give in to this maniac.

1347
01:43:10,302 --> 01:43:11,582
You think you know better?

1348
01:43:11,761 --> 01:43:15,129
I think that if we could talk to Dent
today, he may feel differently.

1349
01:43:15,306 --> 01:43:19,386
And we wish him a speedy recovery.
Because God knows, we need him now.

1350
01:43:19,561 --> 01:43:21,767
You said you were a man of your word.

1351
01:43:22,063 --> 01:43:24,102
Oh, I am.

1352
01:43:25,817 --> 01:43:28,486
I'm only burning my half.

1353
01:43:29,821 --> 01:43:31,943
All you care about is money.

1354
01:43:32,115 --> 01:43:35,566
This town deserves
a better class of criminal...

1355
01:43:35,743 --> 01:43:37,984
...and I'm gonna give it to them.

1356
01:43:38,788 --> 01:43:41,278
Tell your men they work for me now.

1357
01:43:41,457 --> 01:43:43,829
This is my city.

1358
01:43:44,502 --> 01:43:47,039
They won't work for a freak.

1359
01:43:47,213 --> 01:43:48,920
"Freak."

1360
01:43:49,090 --> 01:43:51,545
Why don't we
cut you up into little pieces...

1361
01:43:51,717 --> 01:43:53,175
...and feed you to your pooches? Hm?

1362
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:56,214
And then we'll see how loyal
a hungry dog really is.

1363
01:43:58,224 --> 01:44:00,549
It's not about money...

1364
01:44:00,726 --> 01:44:03,929
...it's about sending a message.

1365
01:44:04,730 --> 01:44:07,185
Everything burns.

1366
01:44:09,693 --> 01:44:11,851
- Who is this?
I had a vision...

1367
01:44:12,029 --> 01:44:14,780
... of a world without Batman.

1368
01:44:14,949 --> 01:44:17,190
The Mob ground out a little profit...

1369
01:44:17,368 --> 01:44:21,282
... and the police tried to shut them down
one block at a time.

1370
01:44:21,455 --> 01:44:24,740
And it was so boring.

1371
01:44:24,917 --> 01:44:26,874
I've had a change of heart.

1372
01:44:27,044 --> 01:44:29,665
I don 't want Mr. Reese
spoiling everything...

1373
01:44:29,838 --> 01:44:34,546
... but why should I have all the fun?
Let's give someone else a chance.

1374
01:44:34,718 --> 01:44:39,545
If Coleman Reese
isn 't dead in 60 minutes...

1375
01:44:39,723 --> 01:44:41,799
... then I blow up a hospital.

1376
01:44:41,975 --> 01:44:43,552
Call in every officer.

1377
01:44:43,727 --> 01:44:47,060
Tell them to head to their nearest
hospital and start evac and search.

1378
01:44:47,230 --> 01:44:49,352
Call the transit authority,
school board, prisons.

1379
01:44:49,524 --> 01:44:51,148
Get every bus down to a hospital.

1380
01:44:51,318 --> 01:44:55,896
The priority is Gotham General. Wheel
everybody out of that place right now.

1381
01:44:56,072 --> 01:44:57,731
You, you and you, you come with me.

1382
01:44:57,908 --> 01:44:59,781
- Where are we going, sir?
- To get Reese.

1383
01:45:00,118 --> 01:45:03,202
I need you plugged in, checking
Gordon's men and their families.

1384
01:45:03,371 --> 01:45:05,577
- Looking for?
- Hospital admissions.

1385
01:45:05,749 --> 01:45:07,408
Will you be wanting the Batpod?

1386
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:09,541
In the middle of the day?
Not very subtle.

1387
01:45:09,711 --> 01:45:10,991
The Lamborghini, then.

1388
01:45:11,921 --> 01:45:13,035
Much more subtle.

1389
01:45:26,894 --> 01:45:29,384
Excuse me. Let me through.
Excuse me. Okay.

1390
01:45:29,564 --> 01:45:33,063
Sir, could you help, please?

1391
01:45:33,234 --> 01:45:34,941
I'm gonna find a bus for him.

1392
01:45:36,904 --> 01:45:38,777
Sir? Commissioner, do you really think...

1393
01:45:38,948 --> 01:45:41,106
...an ordinary citizen
would try to kill this man?

1394
01:45:45,621 --> 01:45:47,946
Sir. Commissioner.

1395
01:45:50,042 --> 01:45:52,248
Get the cars around the back!

1396
01:45:54,630 --> 01:45:55,958
Go. Keep rolling, Sam.

1397
01:46:01,929 --> 01:46:03,886
I see O'Brien and Richards.

1398
01:46:04,473 --> 01:46:07,972
No immediate family member
admitted to a Gotham hospital.

1399
01:46:09,269 --> 01:46:12,803
They're trying to kill me.
- Well, maybe Batman can save you.

1400
01:46:25,953 --> 01:46:28,574
Davis, they got space. Bring him out.

1401
01:46:30,248 --> 01:46:32,039
Davis.

1402
01:46:37,172 --> 01:46:39,497
I saw Burns and Zachary.

1403
01:46:39,674 --> 01:46:40,872
Nothing on them.

1404
01:46:41,051 --> 01:46:42,509
And a patrolman I don't know.

1405
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:45,629
Okay, so, what now?

1406
01:46:46,514 --> 01:46:48,755
What do we do now?
Where are we going?

1407
01:46:51,519 --> 01:46:53,178
Send the information to Gordon.

1408
01:47:01,070 --> 01:47:02,612
Get out of here.

1409
01:47:04,657 --> 01:47:06,448
Davis.

1410
01:47:09,621 --> 01:47:12,028
Ma'am, we're gonna have to
move him now.

1411
01:47:23,718 --> 01:47:26,043
It's Berg, isn't it?
- Commissioner.

1412
01:47:27,179 --> 01:47:28,637
You okay, son?

1413
01:47:46,657 --> 01:47:48,234
Hi.

1414
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:54,574
You know...

1415
01:47:55,416 --> 01:47:58,500
...I don't want there to be
any hard feelings between us, Harvey.

1416
01:47:58,669 --> 01:48:01,788
- When you and...
- Rachel!

1417
01:48:01,964 --> 01:48:04,252
- Rachel were being abducted...

1418
01:48:04,425 --> 01:48:07,425
...I was sitting in Gordon's cage.

1419
01:48:07,761 --> 01:48:09,670
I didn't rig those charges.

1420
01:48:09,888 --> 01:48:12,343
Your men, your plan.

1421
01:48:12,558 --> 01:48:15,013
Do I really look like a guy with a plan?

1422
01:48:15,435 --> 01:48:18,222
You know what I am?
I'm a dog chasing cars.

1423
01:48:18,855 --> 01:48:21,310
I wouldn't know what to do with one
if I caught it.

1424
01:48:21,483 --> 01:48:24,602
You know? I just do things.

1425
01:48:24,986 --> 01:48:28,686
The Mob has plans. The cops have plans.

1426
01:48:28,865 --> 01:48:31,071
Gordon's got plans.

1427
01:48:31,243 --> 01:48:34,196
You know, they're schemers.

1428
01:48:34,371 --> 01:48:38,119
Schemers trying to control
their little worlds.

1429
01:48:38,291 --> 01:48:39,785
I'm not a schemer.

1430
01:48:39,959 --> 01:48:41,583
I try to show the schemers...

1431
01:48:41,753 --> 01:48:47,043
...how pathetic their attempts
to control things really are.

1432
01:48:48,009 --> 01:48:51,045
So when I say... Ah. Come here.

1433
01:48:51,554 --> 01:48:55,088
When I say that you and your girlfriend
was nothing personal...

1434
01:48:56,643 --> 01:48:58,849
...you'll know that I'm telling the truth.

1435
01:49:01,356 --> 01:49:04,143
- I'm gonna need your weapon.
- What?

1436
01:49:07,904 --> 01:49:09,730
Why? Because my wife's in the hospital?

1437
01:49:10,448 --> 01:49:11,990
Yeah, that'd be why.

1438
01:49:12,909 --> 01:49:16,112
It's the schemers
that put you where you are.

1439
01:49:16,287 --> 01:49:20,070
You were a schemer, you had plans...

1440
01:49:20,249 --> 01:49:22,407
...and look where that got you.

1441
01:49:33,179 --> 01:49:35,551
Police are taking every precaution...

1442
01:49:35,723 --> 01:49:37,845
... urging people not to
take matters into their hands.

1443
01:49:38,017 --> 01:49:40,554
I just did what I do best.

1444
01:49:40,728 --> 01:49:44,346
I took your little plan
and I turned it on itself.

1445
01:49:44,523 --> 01:49:49,861
Look what I did to this city with a few
drums of gas and a couple of bullets.

1446
01:49:50,028 --> 01:49:53,313
Hm? You know what I noticed?

1447
01:49:53,490 --> 01:49:57,024
Nobody panics when
things go "according to plan."

1448
01:49:57,202 --> 01:49:58,861
Even if the plan is horrifying.

1449
01:49:59,496 --> 01:50:04,537
If tomorrow I tell the press that, like,
a gangbanger will get shot...

1450
01:50:04,710 --> 01:50:08,161
...or a truckload of soldiers
will be blowing up...

1451
01:50:08,463 --> 01:50:09,542
...nobody panics.

1452
01:50:10,257 --> 01:50:13,341
Because it's all part of the plan.

1453
01:50:13,510 --> 01:50:18,421
But when I say that
one little old mayor will die...

1454
01:50:18,682 --> 01:50:21,089
...well, then, everyone loses their minds.

1455
01:50:24,521 --> 01:50:27,438
Introduce a little anarchy...

1456
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:30,849
...upset the established order...

1457
01:50:31,027 --> 01:50:35,570
...and everything becomes chaos.

1458
01:50:37,408 --> 01:50:40,159
I'm an agent of chaos.

1459
01:50:40,537 --> 01:50:42,862
Oh, and you know the thing
about chaos?

1460
01:50:44,916 --> 01:50:46,540
It's fair.

1461
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:58,926
- You live.
- Mm-hm.

1462
01:50:59,430 --> 01:51:01,054
You die.

1463
01:51:01,265 --> 01:51:03,257
Mmm. Now we're talking.

1464
01:51:12,610 --> 01:51:14,104
Mr. Reese.

1465
01:51:32,296 --> 01:51:34,454
That's Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

1466
01:51:34,631 --> 01:51:37,631
- That was a very brave thing you did.
- Trying to catch the light?

1467
01:51:37,968 --> 01:51:40,803
- You weren't protecting the van?
- Why? Who's in it?

1468
01:51:46,268 --> 01:51:48,344
Don't you think
I should go to the hospital?

1469
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:51,010
Don't watch a whole lot of news,
do you, Mr. Wayne?

1470
01:52:57,171 --> 01:52:58,997
Southeast.

1471
01:52:59,173 --> 01:53:01,379
It's Gotham General.

1472
01:53:02,134 --> 01:53:03,793
- Did you clear the building?
Yeah.

1473
01:53:06,806 --> 01:53:08,513
You must know
how many were inside.

1474
01:53:08,682 --> 01:53:10,057
You have patient lists, roll call.

1475
01:53:10,226 --> 01:53:12,551
Right now we're showing
50 people missing. One bus.

1476
01:53:12,728 --> 01:53:15,894
The other buses were heading off to
hospitals. I guess we missed one.

1477
01:53:16,065 --> 01:53:18,187
What's your guess
about where Harvey Dent is?

1478
01:53:18,359 --> 01:53:22,819
Keep looking. And keep it to yourself.
Anybody asks, we got him out.

1479
01:53:25,407 --> 01:53:27,814
Get me the mayor's office on the line.

1480
01:53:28,994 --> 01:53:30,737
We're gonna need the National Guard.

1481
01:53:30,913 --> 01:53:32,537
- people are still missing...

1482
01:53:32,706 --> 01:53:33,904
... including GCN's own Mike Engel.

1483
01:53:34,082 --> 01:53:37,332
I'm now being told that we're cutting to
a video GCN has just received.

1484
01:53:37,502 --> 01:53:39,411
I'm Mike Engel for Gotham Tonight.

1485
01:53:39,922 --> 01:53:43,255
"What does it take
to make you people wanna join in?

1486
01:53:43,425 --> 01:53:45,998
You failed to kill the lawyer.
I've gotta get you off the bench...

1487
01:53:46,178 --> 01:53:47,921
...and into the game.
Bench. Game.

1488
01:53:50,098 --> 01:53:52,220
Come nightfall, this city is mine.
Mine.

1489
01:53:52,392 --> 01:53:55,143
- And anyone left here plays by my rules.
- Rules.

1490
01:53:55,437 --> 01:53:58,770
Mr. Fox? Security is showing
a break-in at the R & D Department.

1491
01:53:58,940 --> 01:54:01,062
If you don 't wanna be in the game...

1492
01:54:01,234 --> 01:54:02,609
...get out now.
- Get out now.

1493
01:54:04,779 --> 01:54:07,732
But the bridge-and-tunnel crowd
are sure in for a surprise.

1494
01:54:08,116 --> 01:54:09,823
Ha-ha, ha-ha. "

1495
01:54:43,484 --> 01:54:44,764
Gotham P.D.
has shut down...

1496
01:54:44,944 --> 01:54:47,399
Sweet Jesus.
...the area 's bridges and tunnels.

1497
01:54:47,571 --> 01:54:50,986
Shouldn't you be out there,
you know, doing something?

1498
01:54:51,158 --> 01:54:53,115
It's my day off.

1499
01:54:53,744 --> 01:54:55,321
I gotta take a leak.

1500
01:54:55,496 --> 01:54:57,821
Keep an eye out for me, will you?

1501
01:55:03,420 --> 01:55:05,377
Now what?
Need someone to shake it for you?

1502
01:55:05,548 --> 01:55:07,125
Hello.

1503
01:55:07,841 --> 01:55:09,335
Dent.

1504
01:55:09,510 --> 01:55:11,716
Jesus. I thought you was dead.

1505
01:55:11,887 --> 01:55:13,546
Half.

1506
01:55:19,603 --> 01:55:21,180
Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?

1507
01:55:21,355 --> 01:55:23,347
- It must've been Maroni's men.
- Shut up!

1508
01:55:25,108 --> 01:55:27,230
Are you telling me
that you're gonna protect...

1509
01:55:27,402 --> 01:55:29,145
...the other traitor in Gordon's unit?

1510
01:55:29,321 --> 01:55:30,779
I don't know, he never told me.

1511
01:55:30,948 --> 01:55:34,566
Listen, Dent, I swear to God, I didn't
know what they were gonna do to you.

1512
01:55:36,119 --> 01:55:37,281
That's funny...

1513
01:55:39,039 --> 01:55:41,790
...because I don't know
what's gonna happen to you either.

1514
01:55:45,921 --> 01:55:47,830
Beautiful, isn't it?

1515
01:55:48,215 --> 01:55:49,874
Beautiful.

1516
01:55:50,425 --> 01:55:51,539
Unethical.

1517
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:54,261
Dangerous.

1518
01:55:54,471 --> 01:55:57,970
You've turned every cell phone
in Gotham into a microphone.

1519
01:55:58,141 --> 01:56:00,548
And a high-frequency generator-receiver.

1520
01:56:00,727 --> 01:56:05,803
You took my sonar concept
and applied it to every phone in the city.

1521
01:56:05,982 --> 01:56:10,560
With half the city feeding you sonar,
you can image all of Gotham.

1522
01:56:12,488 --> 01:56:13,863
This is wrong.

1523
01:56:14,032 --> 01:56:16,071
I've gotta find this man, Lucius.

1524
01:56:18,077 --> 01:56:19,357
At what cost?

1525
01:56:19,537 --> 01:56:22,324
The database is null-key encrypted.

1526
01:56:22,498 --> 01:56:24,704
It can only be accessed by one person.

1527
01:56:26,043 --> 01:56:28,201
This is too much power for one person.

1528
01:56:28,379 --> 01:56:30,537
That's why I gave it to you.

1529
01:56:31,007 --> 01:56:32,205
Only you can use it.

1530
01:56:32,383 --> 01:56:36,166
Spying on 30 million people
isn't part of my job description.

1531
01:56:38,389 --> 01:56:42,089
This is an audio sample. If he talks
within range of any phone in the city...

1532
01:56:42,268 --> 01:56:44,474
...you can triangulate his position.

1533
01:56:44,937 --> 01:56:47,427
I'll help you this one time.

1534
01:56:47,898 --> 01:56:49,689
But consider this my resignation.

1535
01:56:49,859 --> 01:56:54,437
As long as this machine is
at Wayne Enterprises, I won't be.

1536
01:56:55,197 --> 01:56:57,106
When you're finished...

1537
01:56:57,783 --> 01:56:58,897
...type in your name.

1538
01:57:07,501 --> 01:57:10,585
My officers are going over
every inch of the tunnels and bridges...

1539
01:57:10,754 --> 01:57:13,957
...but with the Joker's threat,
they're not an option.

1540
01:57:14,132 --> 01:57:16,967
- And land routes east?
- Backed up for hours.

1541
01:57:17,135 --> 01:57:20,753
Which leaves the ferries
with 30,000 ready to board.

1542
01:57:20,931 --> 01:57:23,967
I wanna use the ferries so I can
get those prisoners off the island.

1543
01:57:24,309 --> 01:57:27,096
The men you put away?
Those aren't people I'm worried about.

1544
01:57:27,270 --> 01:57:29,392
You should be.
Whatever the Joker's planning...

1545
01:57:29,564 --> 01:57:34,060
...it's a good bet Harvey's prisoners are
involved. I wanna get them out of here.

1546
01:57:35,529 --> 01:57:36,727
So where is Harvey?

1547
01:57:37,322 --> 01:57:40,488
- We haven't found him.
- Oh, Jesus.

1548
01:57:44,329 --> 01:57:46,405
How long can you keep this quiet?

1549
01:58:00,511 --> 01:58:03,180
Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.

1550
01:58:04,015 --> 01:58:06,173
Going to join your wife?

1551
01:58:09,687 --> 01:58:12,177
- You love her?
- Yes.

1552
01:58:13,065 --> 01:58:16,018
You ever imagine what it would be like
to listen to her die?

1553
01:58:16,194 --> 01:58:17,688
Look, take it up with the Joker.

1554
01:58:17,862 --> 01:58:21,112
He killed your woman. He made you...

1555
01:58:21,282 --> 01:58:22,313
...like this.

1556
01:58:22,700 --> 01:58:25,700
The Joker's just a mad dog.

1557
01:58:25,870 --> 01:58:28,491
I want whoever let him off the leash.

1558
01:58:29,206 --> 01:58:32,539
I took care of Wuertz, but who was
your other man inside Gordon's unit?

1559
01:58:32,710 --> 01:58:35,331
Who picked up Rachel?
Must have been someone she trusted.

1560
01:58:36,547 --> 01:58:38,669
Look, if I tell you...

1561
01:58:38,841 --> 01:58:39,872
...will you let me go?

1562
01:58:40,634 --> 01:58:41,962
Can't hurt your chances.

1563
01:58:44,722 --> 01:58:46,381
It was Ramirez.

1564
01:58:51,812 --> 01:58:55,062
- But you said...
- I said it couldn't hurt your chances.

1565
01:58:58,652 --> 01:59:00,774
You're a lucky man.

1566
01:59:04,241 --> 01:59:05,984
- But he's not.
- Who?

1567
01:59:08,912 --> 01:59:10,322
Your driver.

1568
01:59:23,552 --> 01:59:24,583
Stand back.

1569
01:59:24,761 --> 01:59:27,086
Hey, that ain't right.
We should be on that boat.

1570
01:59:27,264 --> 01:59:29,837
You wanna ride across
with them? Be my guest.

1571
01:59:53,081 --> 01:59:54,788
Sir, they've stopped their engines.

1572
01:59:54,957 --> 01:59:55,988
Right, get on the radio.

1573
01:59:56,167 --> 01:59:59,785
Tell them we'll come back and pick
them up once we dump the scumbags.

1574
01:59:59,962 --> 02:00:02,334
Liberty, this is Spirit. Come in.

1575
02:00:04,383 --> 02:00:05,581
What the heck was that?

1576
02:00:07,511 --> 02:00:08,969
What the...?

1577
02:00:09,513 --> 02:00:12,798
Liberty,
come in, please. This is Spirit. Come in.

1578
02:00:14,435 --> 02:00:16,308
Liberty, we have the same thing.
We've lost both engines.

1579
02:00:16,479 --> 02:00:17,973
- Liberty, come in.
Fox.

1580
02:00:18,147 --> 02:00:20,637
There's something going on
on the ferries.

1581
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:23,688
Get down to the engine room now.

1582
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:26,526
Hey, buddy, what's happening?

1583
02:00:35,122 --> 02:00:38,573
Captain, we got a hundred barrels
down there rigged to blow. And this.

1584
02:00:51,680 --> 02:00:52,759
Oh, my God.

1585
02:00:52,931 --> 02:00:54,757
Looks like some kind of detonator.

1586
02:00:54,933 --> 02:00:57,803
Why would they give us
the detonator to our own bomb?

1587
02:01:00,731 --> 02:01:02,106
Tonight, you're all gonna...

1588
02:01:02,274 --> 02:01:04,017
... be a part of a social experiment.

1589
02:01:07,863 --> 02:01:11,694
Through the magic of diesel fuel
and ammonium nitrate...

1590
02:01:11,867 --> 02:01:15,947
... I'm ready right now
to blow you all sky-high.

1591
02:01:16,121 --> 02:01:18,197
Liberty, come in, over.

1592
02:01:19,666 --> 02:01:20,697
It's dead.

1593
02:01:21,042 --> 02:01:25,538
If anyone attempts
to get off their boat, you all die.

1594
02:01:25,880 --> 02:01:27,160
I'm zeroing in.

1595
02:01:27,340 --> 02:01:31,883
Each of you has a remote
to blow up the other boat.

1596
02:01:32,053 --> 02:01:34,508
His voice is on the ferry...

1597
02:01:34,681 --> 02:01:36,720
...but it's not the source.

1598
02:01:38,977 --> 02:01:40,091
West.

1599
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:49,648
- Gordon.
I have the Joker's location.

1600
02:01:49,821 --> 02:01:50,900
Prewitt Building.

1601
02:01:51,072 --> 02:01:53,527
Assemble on the building opposite.

1602
02:01:54,909 --> 02:01:57,696
At midnight, I blow you all up.

1603
02:01:57,870 --> 02:02:03,030
lf, however, one of you presses
the button, I'll let that boat live.

1604
02:02:03,209 --> 02:02:05,331
So who 's it gonna be?

1605
02:02:05,503 --> 02:02:08,040
Harvey Dent's most-wanted
scumbag collection...

1606
02:02:08,214 --> 02:02:11,547
... or the sweet and innocent civilians?

1607
02:02:11,717 --> 02:02:14,254
You choose.

1608
02:02:14,428 --> 02:02:16,337
Oh, and you might wanna
decide quickly...

1609
02:02:16,514 --> 02:02:20,843
... because the people on the other boat
may not be quite so noble.

1610
02:02:28,233 --> 02:02:29,264
Stay back.

1611
02:02:29,443 --> 02:02:33,226
Well, now, who are you to decide?
We ought to talk this over, at least.

1612
02:02:33,614 --> 02:02:37,196
We don't all have to die.
Those men had their chance.

1613
02:02:37,826 --> 02:02:41,609
- We are not going to talk about this.
- Why aren't we talking about it?

1614
02:02:41,788 --> 02:02:44,361
They're talking over the same thing
on the other boat.

1615
02:02:44,541 --> 02:02:46,829
- Let's put it to a vote.
Yes!

1616
02:02:52,132 --> 02:02:54,705
- Hello?
Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez.

1617
02:02:54,885 --> 02:02:57,921
Jim needs you to pack up
and put the kids in the car right away.

1618
02:02:58,096 --> 02:02:59,803
But the units outside...

1619
02:02:59,973 --> 02:03:01,550
Those cops can 't be trusted.

1620
02:03:01,725 --> 02:03:04,678
Jim needs you away from them
as soon as possible.

1621
02:03:04,853 --> 02:03:07,806
I'll call them off for 10 minutes,
and you'll have to move fast.

1622
02:03:07,981 --> 02:03:11,812
- But where am I supposed to take them?
- 25052nd Street.

1623
02:03:11,985 --> 02:03:13,858
Leave as soon as
the patrol car pulls out.

1624
02:03:14,028 --> 02:03:15,403
Okay.

1625
02:03:15,780 --> 02:03:17,571
She believe you?

1626
02:03:17,782 --> 02:03:19,821
It's because she trusts you...

1627
02:03:20,160 --> 02:03:21,239
...just like Rachel did.

1628
02:03:21,411 --> 02:03:23,487
- I didn't know...
- Didn't know what they'd do?

1629
02:03:23,663 --> 02:03:26,414
You're the second cop to say that to me.

1630
02:03:26,666 --> 02:03:28,788
What exactly did you think
they were gonna do?

1631
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:31,201
They got me early on.
My mother's hospital bills...

1632
02:03:31,379 --> 02:03:34,415
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.

1633
02:03:34,966 --> 02:03:37,421
You live to fight another day, officer.

1634
02:03:41,222 --> 02:03:43,048
We found the missing hospital bus.

1635
02:03:43,224 --> 02:03:44,931
Then we have a hostage situation.

1636
02:03:47,019 --> 02:03:49,011
It's a shooting gallery.

1637
02:03:49,397 --> 02:03:51,685
Why would he choose a spot
with such big windows?

1638
02:03:51,857 --> 02:03:53,683
We have clear shots on five clowns.

1639
02:03:53,859 --> 02:03:56,610
Snipers take them out,
smash the windows, a team rappels in.

1640
02:03:57,029 --> 02:03:58,523
Team moves in by the stairwells.

1641
02:03:58,697 --> 02:04:00,819
Two, three casualties max.

1642
02:04:00,991 --> 02:04:02,864
- Let's do it.
It's not that simple.

1643
02:04:03,035 --> 02:04:05,360
- With the Joker, it never is.
- What's simple is...

1644
02:04:05,538 --> 02:04:08,704
...every second, those people on
the ferries get closer to blowing...

1645
02:04:08,874 --> 02:04:11,411
- That won't happen.
- Then he'll blow both of them up!

1646
02:04:11,585 --> 02:04:15,333
- We don't have time for paper ballots.
- I want everybody to put their votes...

1647
02:04:15,506 --> 02:04:17,498
...on this piece of paper.

1648
02:04:18,550 --> 02:04:21,385
If anyone's got pens, pass it along.

1649
02:04:21,720 --> 02:04:23,511
Thank you.
Anybody else?

1650
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:25,506
Coming through. Anybody else?
Thank you.

1651
02:04:25,682 --> 02:04:28,552
We need to get these votes in quickly.

1652
02:04:28,727 --> 02:04:30,269
Come on.

1653
02:04:32,272 --> 02:04:34,394
What are you waiting for?
Push the button!

1654
02:04:34,566 --> 02:04:36,523
We're running out of time!

1655
02:04:37,819 --> 02:04:39,645
I need five minutes alone.

1656
02:04:39,821 --> 02:04:41,647
No! There's no time!

1657
02:04:41,823 --> 02:04:43,233
We have clear shots!

1658
02:04:43,408 --> 02:04:46,325
Dent is in there with them.
We have to save Dent!

1659
02:04:46,495 --> 02:04:48,452
I have to save Dent.

1660
02:04:48,622 --> 02:04:49,736
Get ready.

1661
02:04:52,584 --> 02:04:55,253
Two minutes, then we breach.

1662
02:05:00,842 --> 02:05:02,336
Fox, I need picture.

1663
02:05:05,388 --> 02:05:07,843
- Hello?
Jim, we're in trouble.

1664
02:05:09,100 --> 02:05:11,388
Okay, you got POV on alpha...

1665
02:05:12,437 --> 02:05:14,394
... omni on beta.

1666
02:05:15,857 --> 02:05:19,225
Looks like clowns and hostages
on two floors.

1667
02:05:19,402 --> 02:05:21,809
There's a SWA T team on the stairwell.

1668
02:05:25,116 --> 02:05:27,737
Another SWA T team on the roof.

1669
02:05:29,287 --> 02:05:30,485
Line's clear.

1670
02:05:32,248 --> 02:05:34,952
- Barbara, calm down.
- He has the kids!

1671
02:05:35,126 --> 02:05:38,376
Hello, Jim.
- Harvey?

1672
02:05:39,171 --> 02:05:42,374
- Where's my family?
- Where my family died.

1673
02:05:45,469 --> 02:05:47,128
Blue team, acquire the target.

1674
02:05:48,806 --> 02:05:51,379
Entry team, set your charge.

1675
02:06:07,324 --> 02:06:09,150
Fox, the SWA Ts are
targeting the wrong people.

1676
02:06:09,326 --> 02:06:10,820
The clowns are the hostages.

1677
02:06:11,537 --> 02:06:13,328
Red team, go! Red team, go!

1678
02:06:17,084 --> 02:06:18,494
Entry team, blow and go!

1679
02:06:22,589 --> 02:06:23,999
Don't move.

1680
02:06:25,175 --> 02:06:26,550
Take the shot.

1681
02:06:32,182 --> 02:06:33,841
Those SWA Ts are coming in hot.

1682
02:06:34,017 --> 02:06:35,843
Clowns, put down your guns.

1683
02:06:36,353 --> 02:06:38,974
Drop your weapons!
On the ground, now!

1684
02:06:39,189 --> 02:06:42,355
Doctors, get down!
Clear the line of fire. Drop your weap...

1685
02:07:06,966 --> 02:07:08,128
Freeze!

1686
02:07:08,301 --> 02:07:10,673
Stand down or you will be...

1687
02:07:14,223 --> 02:07:15,681
Look up.

1688
02:07:16,267 --> 02:07:18,840
See those bad guys on the floor above?

1689
02:07:19,020 --> 02:07:22,020
They're waiting to ambush
the SWA T team coming up the elevator.

1690
02:07:22,481 --> 02:07:23,512
Sixty seconds.

1691
02:07:31,824 --> 02:07:36,402
The tally is 140 against, 396 for.

1692
02:07:44,545 --> 02:07:47,082
So go ahead. Do it.

1693
02:07:47,256 --> 02:07:49,248
We're still here.

1694
02:07:50,426 --> 02:07:53,379
And that means they haven't
killed us yet either.

1695
02:07:54,847 --> 02:07:56,590
Go, go, go!

1696
02:07:56,765 --> 02:07:58,556
Blue team, cover!

1697
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:02,551
Uh-oh.

1698
02:08:04,064 --> 02:08:05,723
Trouble on the floor above.

1699
02:08:15,075 --> 02:08:16,450
Get down on the ground now!

1700
02:08:24,876 --> 02:08:27,283
Freeze! Stop or we will shoot.

1701
02:08:27,462 --> 02:08:29,454
We will shoot you. Drop the officer.

1702
02:08:29,631 --> 02:08:31,173
Release the officer right now.

1703
02:08:31,341 --> 02:08:33,298
Let him go now!
On your knees!

1704
02:08:33,885 --> 02:08:35,961
We got him. He's out of the game.

1705
02:08:36,137 --> 02:08:38,627
Keep your hands in the air!
Step away from the edge!

1706
02:08:46,689 --> 02:08:48,313
Halt!

1707
02:09:01,621 --> 02:09:02,996
Stay down!
Don't move!

1708
02:09:03,164 --> 02:09:07,457
Be advised. Clowns
are hostages, doctors are targets.

1709
02:09:13,758 --> 02:09:15,916
Ah, you made it. I'm so thrilled.

1710
02:09:16,093 --> 02:09:19,259
- Where's the detonator?
- Go get him.

1711
02:09:32,651 --> 02:09:35,735
Put down your weapon!
Don't move!

1712
02:10:07,144 --> 02:10:09,017
You don't wanna die...

1713
02:10:09,187 --> 02:10:12,223
...but you don't know how to take a life.

1714
02:10:12,399 --> 02:10:14,058
Give it to me.

1715
02:10:14,359 --> 02:10:18,688
These men will kill you
and take it anyway.

1716
02:10:22,117 --> 02:10:24,607
No one wants to get their hands dirty.

1717
02:10:24,786 --> 02:10:27,739
Fine. I'll do it.

1718
02:10:29,416 --> 02:10:32,120
Those men on that boat?
They made their choices.

1719
02:10:32,293 --> 02:10:34,581
They chose to murder and steal.

1720
02:10:34,754 --> 02:10:37,957
It doesn't make any sense
for us to have to die too.

1721
02:10:47,433 --> 02:10:49,888
All the old familiar places.

1722
02:10:56,192 --> 02:10:57,271
Stand by.

1723
02:11:07,620 --> 02:11:11,202
Red team, floor secure.
Hostages are safe.

1724
02:11:11,415 --> 02:11:13,491
Give it to me.

1725
02:11:14,919 --> 02:11:18,667
You can tell them I took it by force.

1726
02:11:19,173 --> 02:11:24,084
Give it to me, and I'll do what
you should've did 10 minutes ago.

1727
02:11:46,158 --> 02:11:49,491
We really should stop this fighting,
otherwise we'll miss the fireworks.

1728
02:11:49,661 --> 02:11:51,487
There won't be any fireworks.

1729
02:11:51,913 --> 02:11:55,116
And here we go.

1730
02:12:34,455 --> 02:12:36,364
What were you trying to prove?

1731
02:12:36,541 --> 02:12:39,494
That deep down,
everyone's as ugly as you?

1732
02:12:40,628 --> 02:12:41,659
You're alone.

1733
02:12:48,261 --> 02:12:53,765
Can't rely on anyone these days. You
gotta do everything yourself. Don't we?

1734
02:12:53,975 --> 02:12:56,810
That's okay. I came prepared.

1735
02:12:57,019 --> 02:13:01,479
It's a funny world we live in. Speaking of
which, you know how I got these scars?

1736
02:13:01,649 --> 02:13:04,484
No, but I know how you got these.

1737
02:13:22,294 --> 02:13:25,045
Oh, you.

1738
02:13:25,214 --> 02:13:28,250
You just couldn't let me go, could you?

1739
02:13:29,384 --> 02:13:33,298
This is what happens
when an unstoppable force...

1740
02:13:33,472 --> 02:13:37,932
...meets an immovable object.

1741
02:13:38,518 --> 02:13:43,938
You truly are incorruptible, aren't you?

1742
02:13:44,107 --> 02:13:46,811
Huh? You won't kill me...

1743
02:13:46,985 --> 02:13:53,236
...out of some misplaced sense
of self-righteousness.

1744
02:13:53,408 --> 02:13:56,611
And I won't kill you...

1745
02:13:56,786 --> 02:14:00,569
...because you're just too much fun.

1746
02:14:01,624 --> 02:14:05,787
I think you and I are destined
to do this forever.

1747
02:14:05,962 --> 02:14:07,954
You'll be in a padded cell forever.

1748
02:14:08,131 --> 02:14:09,957
Maybe we could share one.

1749
02:14:10,133 --> 02:14:11,591
You know,
they'll be doubling up...

1750
02:14:11,759 --> 02:14:14,296
...the rate this city's inhabitants
are losing their minds.

1751
02:14:14,470 --> 02:14:17,589
This city just showed you...

1752
02:14:17,765 --> 02:14:21,809
...that it's full of people
ready to believe in good.

1753
02:14:21,978 --> 02:14:25,144
Until their spirit breaks completely.

1754
02:14:26,024 --> 02:14:30,851
Until they get a good look
at the real Harvey Dent...

1755
02:14:31,028 --> 02:14:33,815
...and all the heroic things he's done.

1756
02:14:35,491 --> 02:14:40,532
You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle
for Gotham's soul...

1757
02:14:40,705 --> 02:14:43,622
...in a fistfight with you?

1758
02:14:44,166 --> 02:14:45,708
No.

1759
02:14:45,876 --> 02:14:49,291
You need an ace in the hole.

1760
02:14:49,463 --> 02:14:51,087
Mine's Harvey.

1761
02:14:51,465 --> 02:14:53,172
What did you do?

1762
02:14:53,342 --> 02:14:56,342
I took Gotham's white knight...

1763
02:14:56,512 --> 02:15:00,130
...and I brought him down to our level.

1764
02:15:00,558 --> 02:15:03,511
It wasn't hard.
See, madness, as you know...

1765
02:15:03,686 --> 02:15:06,722
...is like gravity.

1766
02:15:06,897 --> 02:15:09,222
All it takes is a little push.

1767
02:15:26,166 --> 02:15:27,909
Dent!

1768
02:15:48,897 --> 02:15:53,226
This is where they brought her,
Gordon, after your men handed her over.

1769
02:15:53,985 --> 02:15:55,562
This is where she died.

1770
02:15:55,737 --> 02:15:58,062
I know, I was here...

1771
02:15:59,115 --> 02:16:01,866
...trying to save her.
- But you didn't.

1772
02:16:02,160 --> 02:16:03,903
- I couldn't.
- Yes, you could've.

1773
02:16:04,078 --> 02:16:05,572
If you'd listened to me.

1774
02:16:05,747 --> 02:16:08,368
If you stood up against corruption...

1775
02:16:08,541 --> 02:16:10,747
...instead of doing your deal
with the devil.

1776
02:16:10,918 --> 02:16:12,542
I was trying to fight the Mob!

1777
02:16:13,046 --> 02:16:17,873
You wouldn't dare try to justify yourself
if you knew what I'd lost.

1778
02:16:19,177 --> 02:16:22,296
Have you ever had to talk to the person
you loved most...

1779
02:16:22,472 --> 02:16:26,339
...tell them it's gonna be all right,
when you know it's not?

1780
02:16:28,019 --> 02:16:31,886
Well, you're about to know
what that feels like, Gordon.

1781
02:16:32,648 --> 02:16:36,515
Then you can look me in the eye
and tell me you're sorry.

1782
02:16:38,279 --> 02:16:41,861
- You're not going to hurt my family.
- No.

1783
02:16:42,032 --> 02:16:44,736
Just the person you love most.

1784
02:16:52,751 --> 02:16:55,787
So is it your wife?

1785
02:16:56,880 --> 02:16:58,539
Put the gun down, Harvey.

1786
02:16:58,924 --> 02:17:00,583
Harvey, put down the gun.

1787
02:17:00,759 --> 02:17:04,293
Please. Please, Harvey. Please.

1788
02:17:05,681 --> 02:17:06,961
Oh, goddamn it.

1789
02:17:07,140 --> 02:17:09,298
Will you stop pointing that gun
at my family?

1790
02:17:09,810 --> 02:17:11,469
No!
- We have a winner.

1791
02:17:11,645 --> 02:17:13,139
No, Jim, stop him!

1792
02:17:13,647 --> 02:17:15,473
Harvey.
Don't let him...

1793
02:17:15,649 --> 02:17:16,763
Harvey!

1794
02:17:18,151 --> 02:17:20,024
I'm sorry!

1795
02:17:21,822 --> 02:17:22,901
For everything.

1796
02:17:25,492 --> 02:17:27,698
Please don't hurt my son.

1797
02:17:37,837 --> 02:17:39,414
You brought your cops?

1798
02:17:39,589 --> 02:17:42,459
All they know is there's a situation.

1799
02:17:42,634 --> 02:17:45,634
They don't know who or what.
They're just creating a perimeter.

1800
02:17:45,804 --> 02:17:48,473
You think I wanna escape from this?

1801
02:17:48,640 --> 02:17:51,391
There is no escape from this.

1802
02:17:51,559 --> 02:17:53,681
You don't wanna hurt the boy, Harvey.

1803
02:17:55,980 --> 02:17:59,183
It's not about what I want,
it's about what's fair!

1804
02:17:59,942 --> 02:18:04,153
You thought we could be decent men
in an indecent time.

1805
02:18:06,949 --> 02:18:08,028
But you were wrong.

1806
02:18:08,743 --> 02:18:12,526
The world is cruel. And the only morality
in a cruel world...

1807
02:18:13,289 --> 02:18:15,198
...is chance.

1808
02:18:15,374 --> 02:18:17,081
Unbiased.

1809
02:18:17,293 --> 02:18:18,537
Unprejudiced.

1810
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:21,034
Fair.

1811
02:18:21,213 --> 02:18:23,454
His son's got the same chance she had.

1812
02:18:24,216 --> 02:18:25,496
Fifty-fifty.

1813
02:18:25,676 --> 02:18:29,127
What happened to Rachel wasn't
chance. We decided to act.

1814
02:18:29,472 --> 02:18:30,800
We three.

1815
02:18:30,973 --> 02:18:34,388
Then why was it me who was
the only one who lost everything?

1816
02:18:36,896 --> 02:18:39,517
- It wasn't.
- The Joker chose me.

1817
02:18:39,690 --> 02:18:41,978
Because you were the best of us.

1818
02:18:42,151 --> 02:18:47,145
He wanted to prove that
even someone as good as you...

1819
02:18:47,322 --> 02:18:49,065
...could fall.

1820
02:18:49,408 --> 02:18:50,688
And he was right.

1821
02:18:50,868 --> 02:18:53,109
You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey.

1822
02:18:53,287 --> 02:18:56,323
So point it at the people responsible.

1823
02:18:57,291 --> 02:18:59,117
Fair enough.

1824
02:19:02,462 --> 02:19:04,335
You first.

1825
02:19:16,852 --> 02:19:18,511
My turn.

1826
02:19:25,443 --> 02:19:27,435
Harvey, you're right.

1827
02:19:28,488 --> 02:19:31,109
Rachel's death was my fault.

1828
02:19:34,202 --> 02:19:36,657
Please don't punish the boy.

1829
02:19:37,747 --> 02:19:40,950
- Please, punish me.
- I'm about to.

1830
02:19:42,919 --> 02:19:44,876
Tell your boy
he's gonna be all right, Gordon.

1831
02:19:45,338 --> 02:19:46,962
Lie...

1832
02:19:47,465 --> 02:19:48,579
...like I lied.

1833
02:19:52,345 --> 02:19:53,922
It's going to be all right, son.

1834
02:20:32,343 --> 02:20:35,178
Dad? Daddy, is he okay?

1835
02:20:51,695 --> 02:20:53,853
- Thank you.
- You don't have to thank me.

1836
02:20:54,489 --> 02:20:56,280
Yes, I do.

1837
02:21:00,537 --> 02:21:01,865
The Joker won.

1838
02:21:04,291 --> 02:21:07,161
Harvey's prosecution,
everything he fought for...

1839
02:21:07,711 --> 02:21:09,454
...undone.

1840
02:21:09,963 --> 02:21:14,874
Whatever chance you gave us at fixing
our city dies with Harvey's reputation.

1841
02:21:15,051 --> 02:21:16,213
We bet it all on him.

1842
02:21:17,554 --> 02:21:20,424
The Joker took the best of us
and tore him down.

1843
02:21:21,015 --> 02:21:22,425
People will lose hope.

1844
02:21:22,600 --> 02:21:24,343
They won't.

1845
02:21:26,855 --> 02:21:28,728
They must never know what he did.

1846
02:21:28,898 --> 02:21:30,724
Five dead.

1847
02:21:31,025 --> 02:21:32,305
Two of them cops.

1848
02:21:32,485 --> 02:21:34,940
- You can't sweep that...
- No.

1849
02:21:39,742 --> 02:21:42,577
But the Joker cannot win.

1850
02:21:47,834 --> 02:21:51,037
Gotham needs its true hero.

1851
02:21:57,426 --> 02:22:00,462
- No.
- You either die a hero...

1852
02:22:00,638 --> 02:22:05,098
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

1853
02:22:05,267 --> 02:22:07,093
I can do those things...

1854
02:22:07,520 --> 02:22:10,556
...because I'm not a hero, not like Dent.

1855
02:22:13,567 --> 02:22:16,437
I killed those people.
That's what I can be.

1856
02:22:16,612 --> 02:22:18,521
No, no, you can't. You're not.

1857
02:22:18,697 --> 02:22:21,270
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.

1858
02:22:22,951 --> 02:22:24,065
Call it in.

1859
02:22:27,372 --> 02:22:29,115
A hero.

1860
02:22:29,291 --> 02:22:32,541
Not the hero we deserved,
but the hero we needed.

1861
02:22:33,128 --> 02:22:35,665
Nothing less than a knight...

1862
02:22:36,215 --> 02:22:37,922
...shining.

1863
02:22:38,550 --> 02:22:40,174
They'll hunt you.

1864
02:22:40,344 --> 02:22:42,135
You'll hunt me.

1865
02:22:42,638 --> 02:22:44,595
You'll condemn me.

1866
02:22:45,307 --> 02:22:47,595
Set the dogs on me.

1867
02:22:51,354 --> 02:22:53,642
Because that's what needs to happen.

1868
02:22:54,816 --> 02:22:56,725
Because sometimes...

1869
02:22:56,902 --> 02:22:59,060
... the truth isn 't good enough.

1870
02:22:59,946 --> 02:23:02,234
Sometimes people deserve more.

1871
02:23:05,702 --> 02:23:09,616
Sometimes people deserve
to have their faith rewarded.

1872
02:23:28,016 --> 02:23:29,675
Batman.

1873
02:23:31,602 --> 02:23:33,345
Batman!

1874
02:23:34,147 --> 02:23:36,104
Why's he running, Dad?

1875
02:23:37,150 --> 02:23:38,478
Because we have to chase him.

1876
02:23:38,651 --> 02:23:41,521
Okay, we're going in! Go, go! Move!

1877
02:23:47,618 --> 02:23:49,195
He didn't do anything wrong.

1878
02:23:51,956 --> 02:23:57,542
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,
but not the one it needs right now.

1879
02:23:58,963 --> 02:23:59,994
So we'll hunt him...

1880
02:24:03,133 --> 02:24:05,209
... because he can take it.

1881
02:24:07,721 --> 02:24:10,211
Because he's not our hero.

1882
02:24:17,773 --> 02:24:18,971
He's a silent guardian...

1883
02:24:20,150 --> 02:24:22,023
...a watchful protector.

1884
02:24:24,530 --> 02:24:25,810
A dark knight.
