3
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:47,890
-三个臭皮匠  开工吧  -什么?  就三人?
Three of a kind, let's do this. that's it? three guys?

4
00:01:48,058 --> 00:01:51,392
-房顶上还有俩人  事后五人分成  -五分之一足够了
Two guys on the roof. every guy gets a share. five shares is plenty.

5
00:01:51,562 --> 00:01:54,017
是六人分成  别忘了幕后策划
Six shares. don't forget the guy who planned the job.

6
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:56,478
他以为能坐享其成?
He thinks he can sit it out and still take a slice.

7
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,770
-我知道大家为何叫他小丑了  -为何?
- I know why they call him the Joker. why do they call him the Joker?

8
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:01,772
-我听说他一直化着妆  -化妆?
I heard he wears makeup. makeup?

9
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:03,904
嗯  为了吓吓人  就像战士抹油彩
Yeah, to scare people. you know, war paint.

10
00:02:16,462 --> 00:02:19,665
大家都听着!  举起手来!  低下头!
All right, everybody, hands up, heads down!

11
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:22,836
我说了  双手举过头!
I said, hands up, heads down!

12
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,964
-放轻松  伙计  -我是来取款的
Let's go, pal, I'm making a withdrawal here.

13
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:27,680
-我说了  举起手!  -不!
- I said, hands up! - no!

14
00:02:28,057 --> 00:02:30,298
这就是无声报警器来着
Here comes the silent alarm.

15
00:02:30,476 --> 00:02:31,804
我来搞定
And there it goes.

16
00:02:31,977 --> 00:02:33,175
低下头!
Heads down!

17
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:35,679
好了  亲爱的  你给我趴下吧
All right, tootsie, you're taking a dive with me.

18
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:38,525
-趴下!  我说了别乱动!  -请别伤害我
- down! I said, stay down there! don't hurt me!

19
00:02:38,776 --> 00:02:41,777
有趣  竟然不是拨报警电话  而转到私人号码
Funny, it didn't dial 911. it was trying to reach a private number.

20
00:02:41,946 --> 00:02:43,855
-有什么问题么?  -没  我搞定了
Is it a problem? no, I'm done here.

21
00:02:53,249 --> 00:02:55,621
坐下!  坐下!
Sit down! down!

22
00:02:56,126 --> 00:02:58,285
趴下!  我说了都别动!
Down! I said, stay down there!

23
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:05,385
很显然我希望你们别乱动
Obviously we don't want you doing anything with your hands...

24
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:08,470
否则小命不保了
...other than holding on for dear life.

25
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,222
趴下!  都趴下!
On the ground! stay on the ground!

26
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:22,064
谁都不许动!  都不许动!
Nobody make a move! nobody! stay down!

27
00:03:42,381 --> 00:03:44,457
你们知道在抢谁的钱么?
You have any idea who you're stealing from?

28
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:48,334
-你们死定了  -他没子弹了吧?
- you and your friends are dead. he's out, right?

29
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:52,677
什么...?
What...?

30
00:04:00,524 --> 00:04:02,268
你会数数么?
Where did you learn to count?

31
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,110
这门上有5000伏的高压电
They wired this thing up with like 5000 volts.

32
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:08,526
这是什么银行啊?
What kind of bank does that?

33
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:11,735
流氓银行  我猜小丑跟传闻中一样疯狂
A mob bank. I guess the Joker's as crazy as they say.

34
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:12,942
拆报警器的人呢?
Where's the alarm guy?

35
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,611
老板说等他干完就解决掉
Boss told me when the guy was done, I should take him out.

36
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,118
少个人分钱  对吧?
One less share, right?

37
00:04:18,042 --> 00:04:20,283
有趣  他也跟我这么说的
Funny, he told me something similar.

38
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:21,919
啥?  不  不要!
He what? no! no!

39
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:35,016
钱真多啊
That's a lot of money.

40
00:04:35,184 --> 00:04:38,884
若小丑真够聪明  就该弄辆大车
If this Joker guy was so smart, he'd have had us bring a bigger car.

41
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:44,228
我打赌小丑吩咐你装好钱就杀了我
I'm betting the Joker told you to kill me soon as we loaded the cash.

42
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:48,936
不不不  我要杀的是校车司机
No, no, no, I kill the bus driver.

43
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:50,771
校车司机?
Bus driver?

44
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,487
哪儿来的校车司机?
What bus driver?

45
00:04:58,582 --> 00:05:00,491
放学了  该走了
School's out. time to go.

46
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,909
这家伙再也起不来了吧?
That guy's not getting up, is he?

47
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:05,331
钱可真不少
That's a lot of money.

48
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:11,168
其他人都去哪儿了?
What happened to the rest of the guys?

49
00:05:17,935 --> 00:05:20,307
你以为自己很聪明是吧?
You think you're smart, huh?

50
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,646
雇你们做事的人...
The guy that hired youse...

51
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,764
同样会杀了你
...he'll just do the Same to you.

52
00:05:26,068 --> 00:05:29,022
曾经镇上的罪犯还有信仰
Oh, criminals in this town used to believe in things.

53
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:30,477
荣誉...
Honor...

54
00:05:30,656 --> 00:05:32,364
尊重...
...respect.

55
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,858
看看你  你有信仰么?
Look at you. what do you believe in, huh?

56
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,316
你相信什么?!
What do you believe in?!

57
00:05:36,662 --> 00:05:41,573
我相信杀不死你的  会让你变得更...
I believe whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you...

58
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:44,711
诡异
...stanger.

59
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,588
市长先生  你是为了清剿城市犯罪而被选举出来
Mr. mayor, you were elected in a campaign to clean up the city.

60
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:31,915
-您准备何时行动?  -我已经开始了
- when are you gonna start? I already have.

61
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,172
像是蝙蝠侠么
Like this batman.

62
00:06:33,344 --> 00:06:35,917
我们听说他伸张正义  罪犯被吓得逃窜
We're hearing he's doing good, criminals are running scared.

63
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:39,797
-不行  伙计  今晚不行  -你这算什么?  迷信么?
- no, man. I don't like it tonight. - what are you, superstitious?

64
00:06:39,975 --> 00:06:43,060
你遇上他的几率比中彩票还小
You got more chance of winning the powerball than running into him.

65
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:46,597
不是的  我们重案组的人已经很接近了...
That's not true. our men in the major crimes unit are close to an arrest.

66
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:49,728
嘿  伍尔兹  市长说你要逮到蝙蝠侠了?
Hey, Wuertz, mayor says you're closing in on the batman.

67
00:06:49,902 --> 00:06:52,025
调查仍在进行中
The investigation is ongoing.

68
00:06:52,196 --> 00:06:54,603
街头清剿行动正在进行
The process of cleaning up the streets is a long one.

69
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:56,774
我以我的当选为赌注...
I pledged in my campaign, uh, to have...

70
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:03,410
还想见一面妻子么?  中尉
Ever intending to see your wife again, lieutenant?

71
00:07:03,582 --> 00:07:06,252
我以为你照顾你母亲去了  探员
I thought you had to go look after your mother, detective.

72
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:08,376
我把她送回医院了
Checked her back into the hospital.

73
00:07:08,837 --> 00:07:10,462
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

74
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:14,250
-他还未出现?  -他时常这样
- so he hasn't shown up? - he often doesn't.

75
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,343
我喜欢提醒大家他的存在
I like reminding everybody he's out there.

76
00:07:16,512 --> 00:07:17,792
为何他不出现?
Why wouldn't he come?

77
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,965
希望...
Hopefully...

78
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:22,016
是因为他太忙了
...because he's busy.

79
00:07:38,742 --> 00:07:41,660
这就是为何要带上狗
That's why we bring dogs.

80
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:44,154
-我的小公主  -求求你
- my little princes. please.

81
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:47,914
求求你  它们在我嘴里蠕动  求求你了  弄走它
Please, they're crawling in my mouth. please, I beg you, get them off.

82
00:07:48,085 --> 00:07:50,837
看看你的毒品害我客人成这样
Look what your drugs do to my customers.

83
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:52,629
买者自担风险
Buyer beware.

84
00:07:52,798 --> 00:07:56,001
我有说过我的货会给你幻觉
I told you my compound would take you places.

85
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,928
但从未说过那会是你想要的
I never said they'd be places you wanted to go.

86
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:01,634
我的生意是需要回头客的
My business, repeat customers.

87
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:03,515
你若不喜欢我的货...
You don't like what I have to offer...

88
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,427
你可以找别家买啊
...you can buy from someone else.

89
00:08:05,603 --> 00:08:08,354
前提是蝙蝠侠手下还有漏网之鱼
Assuming batman left anyone to buy from.

90
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:15,690
我的狗可是饿急了
My dogs are hungry.

91
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:21,697
可惜只有你一个人
Pity there's only one of you.

92
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:31,328
什么...?  那不是蝙蝠侠
What...? that's not him.

93
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:37,459
放狗!
Loose the dogs!

94
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:51,731
这才是他的作风
That's more like it.

95
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,563
别让我再看见你们
Don't let me find you out here again.

96
00:10:21,739 --> 00:10:24,574
-我们想帮你  -我不需要帮助!
- we're trying to help you. I don't need help.

97
00:10:24,742 --> 00:10:26,070
我看不然
Not my diagnosis.

98
00:10:26,243 --> 00:10:29,826
你有什么牛气的?  咱俩间有何不同?
What gives you the right? what's the difference between you and me?

99
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:32,867
我可不穿曲棍球垫肩
I'm not wearing hockey pads.

100
00:10:36,378 --> 00:10:38,335
所有人都退后
Everybody back now!

101
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:43,674
他故意暴露他的扮相
He can't resist showing us his face.

102
00:10:47,932 --> 00:10:50,090
化妆下面掩藏的又是什么?
What's he hiding under that makeup?

103
00:10:57,816 --> 00:11:00,486
伙计们  能请离开下么?
Uh, can we get a minute, people, please?

104
00:11:03,113 --> 00:11:05,272
又是他  其他帮凶的身份呢?
Him again. who are the others?

105
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:07,027
一群无关紧要的小虾米
Another bunch of smalltimers.

106
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,118
这些是我给你的有标记的钱
Some of the marked bills I gave you.

107
00:11:10,287 --> 00:11:12,576
我的探员们一直在和他们进行毒品交易
My detectives have been making drug buys with them.

108
00:11:12,748 --> 00:11:15,321
这家银行帮他们洗黑钱  这是第五家
This bank was another drop for the mob. that makes five.

109
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:18,074
-我们找到大量黑钱  -该介入了
- we found the bulk of their dirty cash. - time to move in.

110
00:11:18,254 --> 00:11:22,038
我们要同时审查所有银行  特警队作后援
We'd have to hit all banks simultaneously. swat teams, backup.

111
00:11:22,383 --> 00:11:24,043
这个叫小丑的怎么办?
What about this Joker guy?

112
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:27,172
跟一大群抢匪相比  他可以暂缓
One man or the entire mob? he can wait.

113
00:11:27,346 --> 00:11:29,671
等新的地方检察官听说了  他也要加入的
When the new da hears about this, he'll want in.

114
00:11:29,848 --> 00:11:32,386
-你信任他么?  -我很难阻止他介入
- do you trust him? - be hard to keep him out.

115
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,011
我听说他和你一样固执
I hear he's as stubborn as you are.

116
00:12:19,565 --> 00:12:22,519
维恩庄园重建后肯定很漂亮
Be nice when Wayne manor's rebuilt.

117
00:12:22,693 --> 00:12:25,398
但不论是庄园还是公寓...
You can swap not sleeping in a penthouse...

118
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:27,113
你都不会睡在里面
...for not sleeping in a mansion.

119
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:31,029
每次你给自己缝针都弄得血肉模糊
Whenever you stitch yourself up, you do make a bloody mess.

120
00:12:31,201 --> 00:12:34,202
是啊  这才让我从失误里吸取教训
Yeah. it makes me learn from my mistakes.

121
00:12:34,371 --> 00:12:37,787
那你现在应该经验丰富
You ought to be pretty knowledgeable by now, then.

122
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:40,533
我的那堆盔甲
My armor.

123
00:12:40,711 --> 00:12:44,294
行头太重  我得...变得更轻快些
I'm carrying too much weight. I need to be... I need to be faster.

124
00:12:44,465 --> 00:12:47,134
我相信福克斯先生可以解决
I'm sure mr. Fox can oblige.

125
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:49,792
-你被老虎咬伤了?  -是狗
- did you get mauled by a tiger? - it was a dog.

126
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,508
-啊?  -很大很大的狗
- huh? - it was a big dog.

127
00:12:52,681 --> 00:12:56,549
昨晚模仿者更多了  阿尔弗雷德  还带着枪呢
There were more copycats last night, Alfred, with guns.

128
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:58,636
何不雇他们来干?  给自己放个假
Why not hire them, take the weekend off?

129
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:01,648
我有说过想激励大众...
That wasn't exactly what I had in mind...

130
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:03,559
但可不是用这种方式
...when I said I wanted to inspire people.

131
00:13:03,734 --> 00:13:05,643
我明白
I know.

132
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:07,314
不过情况有所好转
But things have improved.

133
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:09,985
看看新来的地方检察官
Look at the new district attorney.

134
00:13:10,658 --> 00:13:12,650
我正密切关注着
I am, closely.

135
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,736
得看看他是否值得信任
Need to know if he can be trusted.

136
00:13:14,912 --> 00:13:18,957
你是关心他的人品还是社交圈子?
Are you interested in his character or his social circle?

137
00:13:22,795 --> 00:13:25,167
瑞秋和谁在一起是她自己的事
Who Rachel spends her time with is her business.

138
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:29,207
我相信我休假的时候你没跟踪我
I trust you don't have me followed on my day off.

139
00:13:29,385 --> 00:13:31,461
若你真休假了  我会考虑的
If you ever took one, I might.

140
00:13:33,305 --> 00:13:35,179
认清自己的极限  维恩先生
Know your limits, master Wayne.

141
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:38,469
蝙蝠侠可没有极限
Batman has no limits.

142
00:13:38,644 --> 00:13:41,680
-而您有  先生  -我可不期望那天到来
- well, you do, sir. - well, can't afford to know them.

143
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:44,346
等那天来临了你要怎么办呢?
And what's gonna happen on the day that you find out?

144
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:47,230
我俩都清楚你喜欢说"我早提醒过你"
We all know how much you like to say "i told you so."

145
00:13:47,403 --> 00:13:50,736
真到那一天  维恩先生  我甚至都不会说了
On that day, master Wayne, even I won't want to.

146
00:13:50,906 --> 00:13:52,365
或许
Probably.

147
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:00,866
对不起  大伙  我知道了
Sorry I'm late, folks.

148
00:14:04,795 --> 00:14:07,001
-你去哪儿了?  -你担心得自己独当一面?
- where were you? - worried you'd have to step up?

149
00:14:07,172 --> 00:14:10,173
-哈维  这些讼诉材料我倒背如流  -那么...
- Harvey, I know these briefs backwards. - well, then...

150
00:14:10,342 --> 00:14:12,335
为公平起见
...fair's fair.

151
00:14:12,511 --> 00:14:14,551
正面我上  背面你上
Heads, I'll take it. tails, he's all yours.

152
00:14:14,722 --> 00:14:16,798
真的?  你想用硬币决定?
Yeah? you wanna flip a coin to see who leads?

153
00:14:16,974 --> 00:14:20,390
家传幸运硬币  我记得它实现了我俩首次约会
My father's lucky coin. as I recall, it got me my first date with you.

154
00:14:20,561 --> 00:14:23,728
我可不会全凭运气做事
I wouldn't leave something like that up to chance.

155
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:27,149
我不是  我自己制造运气
I don't. I make my own luck.

156
00:14:28,652 --> 00:14:32,697
全体起立  尊敬的富里尔法官入庭
All rise. the honorable judge freel presiding.

157
00:14:32,865 --> 00:14:35,534
我以为地方检察官就是和市长打球的
I thought the da just played golf with the mayor.

158
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:39,402
1:30才发球  够时间把你绳之以法
Teeoff's 1:30. more than enough time to put you away for life, sally.

159
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,122
既然卡曼・费康尼在阿卡姆疯人院...
With Carmine Falcone in Arkham...

160
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,291
那得有人出来领导所谓的家族
...someone must have stepped up to run the so-called family.

161
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:47,411
这个人今天在法庭里么?
Is that man in this courtroom today?

162
00:14:48,964 --> 00:14:52,582
-能请你为我们指认出他么?  -你赢了  律师
- could you iDentify him for us, please? - you win, counselor.

163
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:56,423
这个人就是我
It was me.

164
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,924
我有你起誓的证词  说这个人...
I have a sworn statement from you that this man...

165
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:05,803
塞尔瓦托・玛偌尼就是费康尼犯罪家族的新首领
...Salvatore Maroni, is the new head of the Falcone crime family.

166
00:15:05,981 --> 00:15:10,109
玛偌尼?  他是替罪羔羊  我才是组织的头目
Maroni? he's a fall guy. I'm the brains of the organization.

167
00:15:11,487 --> 00:15:13,029
-肃静  -请求法庭...
Order. - permission to treat...

168
00:15:13,197 --> 00:15:14,442
-判其为恶意证人  -批准
...the witness as hostile? - granted.

169
00:15:14,615 --> 00:15:15,646
恶意?  我来告诉你什么叫恶意!
- hostile? I'll show you hostile!

170
00:15:21,872 --> 00:15:24,624
碳纤维材质  28口径  中国制造
Carbon fiber, .28 caliber, made in china.

171
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:26,334
若你想杀公职人员  玛偌尼先生
If you wanna kill a public servant, mr. Maroni...

172
00:15:26,502 --> 00:15:28,708
我奉劝你买美国货
...i recommend you buy american.

173
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,251
-带他出去  -但  法官大人  我还没问完呢
Get him out of here. - but, your honor, I'm not done.

174
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,255
我们没法证明这枪跟玛偌尼有关  所以无法起诉
We'll never be able to link the gun to Maroni, so we can't charge him.

175
00:15:39,431 --> 00:15:42,219
但他们意图杀你  证明你威胁到他们了
But they're trying to kill you, means we're getting to them.

176
00:15:42,393 --> 00:15:45,512
真高兴你这么开心  顺便说下  我没事
I'm glad you're so pleased, Rachel. I'm fine, by the way.

177
00:15:45,688 --> 00:15:47,396
拜托  哈维  你可是高谭的地方检察官
Come on, Harvey. you're Gotham's da.

178
00:15:47,564 --> 00:15:50,400
你若没被枪指过  反而说明你渎职
You're not getting shot at, you're not doing your job right.

179
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:51,766
不过  你想...
But, you know...

180
00:15:51,944 --> 00:15:55,277
若你以受惊为借口  我们可以请半天假
...if you said you were rattled, we could take the rest of the day off.

181
00:15:55,447 --> 00:15:58,365
不行  我约了重案组领导
Can't. I dragged the head of the major crimes unit down here.

182
00:15:58,534 --> 00:16:03,279
吉姆・戈登?  他是我的朋友  礼貌一点
Oh, Jim Gordon? he's a friend, actually. try to be nice.

183
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:15,126
我听说你差点遇害
I hear you got a hell of a right cross.

184
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:20,552
可惜他要被无罪释放了
It's a shame sal's going to walk.

185
00:16:20,723 --> 00:16:22,638
是啊  不过这些抢匪好在
Yeah, well, good thing about the mob

186
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,767
总给你第二次机会
Is they keep giving you second chances

187
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,265
轻微放射性钞票
Lightly irradiated bills.

188
00:16:32,735 --> 00:16:35,023
对于你们警察来说奢华了点  管用么?
Fancy stuff for a city cop. have help?

189
00:16:35,487 --> 00:16:37,195
我联系了几个中介
We liaise with various agencies...

190
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:39,108
别编了  戈登  我想见他
Save it, Gordon. I wanna meet him.

191
00:16:39,283 --> 00:16:42,866
官方政策是要逮捕这位义务警员蝙蝠侠
Official policy is to arrest the vigilante known as batman on sight.

192
00:16:43,037 --> 00:16:45,195
重案组楼顶上的强光灯是做啥的?
Mm-hm. what about that floodlight on the top of mcu?

193
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,780
若你对机械故障有疑问
If you got problems with malfunctioning equipment...

194
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:51,161
为建议你去找维修部门
...i suggest you take them up with maintenance, counselor.

195
00:16:51,462 --> 00:16:54,000
我已把高谭市所有洗钱者抓起来了
I've put every money Launderer in Gotham behind bars...

196
00:16:54,173 --> 00:16:56,545
但抢匪还是能拿到钱
...but the mob is still getting its money out.

197
00:16:56,717 --> 00:17:00,168
我觉得你和你的朋友该展开最后一击
I think you and your friend have found the last game in town.

198
00:17:00,346 --> 00:17:03,050
打击他们的要害  他们的钱包
You're trying to hit them where it hurts, their wallets.

199
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:04,386
这是个大胆的行动
It's bold.

200
00:17:05,434 --> 00:17:06,465
你要让我参与么?
You gonna count me in?

201
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:10,388
在这地方  越少人知道  行动越安全
In this town, the fewer people know something, the safer the operation.

202
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:12,806
我不喜欢你有自己的特别行动组
I don't like that you got your own special unit...

203
00:17:12,983 --> 00:17:15,901
且这些警察都在接受我内务部的调查
...and it's full of cops I investigated at internal affairs.

204
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,905
若我不和接受你调查的警察合作
If I didn't work with cops you'd investigated while at ia...

205
00:17:19,073 --> 00:17:20,318
那我就得单干了
...i'd be working alone.

206
00:17:21,075 --> 00:17:22,984
我可不是从政治角度看的完美主义者
I don't get political points for being an idealist.

207
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,568
我只是尽我所有做到最好
I do the best I can with what I have.

208
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:32,915
你想让我授权你搜查五家银行
You want me to back warrants for search and seizure on five banks...

209
00:17:33,087 --> 00:17:34,914
却又不告诉我搜查些什么
...without telling me what we're after.

210
00:17:36,006 --> 00:17:38,580
我可以告诉你这些银行的名字
I can give you the names of the banks.

211
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,668
这算是个好的开始
Well, that's a start.

212
00:17:41,053 --> 00:17:43,378
我可以给你搜查证  但我需要你的信任
I'll get you your warrants, but I want your trust.

213
00:17:43,555 --> 00:17:45,215
你不用卖这个人情  登特
Oh, you don't have to sell me, Dent.

214
00:17:45,391 --> 00:17:47,383
我们都知道你是高谭市的光明骑士
We all know you're Gotham's White knight.

215
00:17:48,644 --> 00:17:52,095
不过  我听说重案组对我有个别的称呼
Yeah, well, I heard they have a different name for me down at mcu.

216
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,970
这我就不知道了
I wouldn't know about that.

217
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:58,934
在中国  刘氏证券投资公司代表着快速增长
In china, Lau security investments stands for dynamic new growth.

218
00:17:59,113 --> 00:18:03,407
维恩企业与中国合资前途无量
A joint chinese venture with Wayne enterprises will be a powerhouse.

219
00:18:03,575 --> 00:18:05,485
刘先生...
Well, mr. Lau...

220
00:18:05,869 --> 00:18:08,621
我代表全体董事会...
...i speak for the rest of the board...

221
00:18:09,206 --> 00:18:12,124
和维恩先生...表达我们的欣喜
...and mr. Wayne, in expressing our own excitement.

222
00:18:17,006 --> 00:18:18,509
先生  我知道维恩先生很关心
Sir, I know mr. Wayne is curious

223
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,624
他信托基金的补充
About how his trust fund gets replenished..

224
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:23,292
但说实话  弗兰克里  这太尴尬了
...but, frankly, this is embarrassing.

225
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,044
你去搞定委托事宜  里斯先生
You worry about the diligence, mr. Reese.

226
00:18:26,223 --> 00:18:28,512
我来关心布鲁斯・维恩
I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.

227
00:18:28,684 --> 00:18:30,226
就这样了
It's done.

228
00:18:30,394 --> 00:18:32,137
就是这个数字了
The numbers are solid.

229
00:18:32,313 --> 00:18:33,855
再努力一下
Do them again.

230
00:18:34,023 --> 00:18:37,107
我们都不想信托基金用光吧
Wouldn't want the trust fund to run out, now, would we?

231
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,445
又熬夜了?
Another long night?

232
00:18:41,614 --> 00:18:44,568
合资是你的主意  顾问们也喜欢
This joint venture was your idea, and the consultants love it.

233
00:18:45,242 --> 00:18:46,487
但我不确定
But I'm not convinced.

234
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:50,325
刘氏企业保持每年8%的增长率
Lau's company has grown by 8 percent annually like clockwork.

235
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:52,905
他们准在做假帐
His revenue stream must be off the books...

236
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,494
甚至还有违法勾当
...maybe even illegal.

237
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:56,328
好吧  取消交易
Okay. cancel the deal.

238
00:18:57,671 --> 00:18:58,834
你已经知道了?
You already knew.

239
00:18:59,548 --> 00:19:02,086
我只是想仔细看看他们的账目
Just needed a closer look at their books.

240
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:04,299
那还需要我做什么?
Anything else you can trouble me for?

241
00:19:04,762 --> 00:19:06,304
我需要一身新行头
I need a new suit.

242
00:19:06,472 --> 00:19:08,963
是啊  三纽扣是90年代的款式了  维恩先生
Yeah. three buttons is a little'90s, mr. Wayne.

243
00:19:09,141 --> 00:19:12,261
我不是在讨论时尚  福克斯先生  而是说功能
I'm not talking fashion, mr. Fox, so much as function.

244
00:19:13,312 --> 00:19:15,020
你想方便掉头?
You wanna be able to turn your head.

245
00:19:15,189 --> 00:19:17,265
那样倒车入库更方便
Sure make backing out of the driveway easier.

246
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:19,275
尽我所能吧
I'll see what I can do.

247
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,988
花了3周才订到位置
Took three weeks to get a reservation here.

248
00:19:26,158 --> 00:19:28,281
我还不得不打出政府官员牌
I had to tell them I work for the government.

249
00:19:28,452 --> 00:19:29,697
-真的?  -卫生监查官
- really? - health inspector's...

250
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,115
也暗中帮了点忙
...not afraid to pull strings.

251
00:19:31,288 --> 00:19:33,495
瑞秋  真巧啊
Rachel. fancy that.

252
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,157
是啊  布鲁斯  真巧
Yeah, Bruce. fancy that.

253
00:19:36,502 --> 00:19:38,660
瑞秋  这是娜塔莎  娜塔莎  这是瑞秋
Rachel, natascha. natascha, Rachel.

254
00:19:38,837 --> 00:19:44,212
-娜塔莎  你难道是...  -莫斯科芭蕾舞团首席舞者
- natascha. are you the prima...? - prima ballerina for the moscow ballet.

255
00:19:44,385 --> 00:19:47,718
-哈维下周要带我去看演出  -是吗?  你也喜欢芭蕾?
- wow. Harvey's taking me next week. - really? so you're into ballet?

256
00:19:48,055 --> 00:19:50,213
布鲁斯  这是哈维・登特
Bruce. this is Harvey Dent.

257
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:54,306
大名鼎鼎的布鲁斯・维恩  瑞秋把你的事都讲给我听了
The famous Bruce Wayne. Rachel's told me everything about you.

258
00:19:54,478 --> 00:19:55,676
我倒希望不是
I certainly hope not.

259
00:19:56,021 --> 00:19:59,355
-让我们拼桌吧  -我想他们不会允许
- let's put a couple tables together. - I'm not sure that they'll let us.

260
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:02,561
噢  他们会允许的  这里是我开的
Oh, they should. I own the place.

261
00:20:03,028 --> 00:20:05,982
你怎会打算在这样的城市养孩子?
How could you want to raise children in a city like this?

262
00:20:06,156 --> 00:20:08,114
我就是在这儿长大的  也没啥啊
Well, I was raised here. I turned out okay.

263
00:20:08,284 --> 00:20:09,861
维恩庄园也在市内么?
Is Wayne manor in the city limits?

264
00:20:11,704 --> 00:20:13,246
庄园么?  是的
The palisades? sure.

265
00:20:13,414 --> 00:20:15,869
作为我们新的地方检察官  你想知道...
You know, as our new da, you might wanna figure out...

266
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,868
你的权限到底有多大
...where your jurisdiction ends.

267
00:20:18,043 --> 00:20:21,993
我是说  这个城市把一个蒙面义警作英雄
I'm talking about the kind of city that idolizes a masked vigilante.

268
00:20:22,172 --> 00:20:25,541
高谭市为有伸张正义的普通市民而骄傲
Gotham city is proud of an ordinary citizen standing up for what's right.

269
00:20:25,718 --> 00:20:27,959
高谭市需要你这样的英雄  选举出来的官员
Gotham needs heroes like you, elected officials...

270
00:20:28,137 --> 00:20:30,094
而不是目无王法的人
...not a man who thinks he's above the law.

271
00:20:30,264 --> 00:20:31,426
谁任命了蝙蝠侠?
Who appointed the batman?

272
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,430
我们  是我们这些让恶势力当道的人
We did. all of us who stood by and let scum take control of our city.

273
00:20:35,603 --> 00:20:37,346
但这是民主国家  哈维
But this is a democracy, Harvey.

274
00:20:37,521 --> 00:20:39,265
当敌人兵临城下时...
When their enemies were at the gates...

275
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,195
罗马人抛开民主
...the romans would suspend democracy

276
00:20:41,196 --> 00:20:43,140
任命了首领来保护城市
And appoint one man to protect the city

277
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:45,892
而那不是荣誉  那是为民服务
It wasn't considered an honor, it was a public service.

278
00:20:46,071 --> 00:20:47,731
哈维  最后一个被任命的人...
Harvey, the last man that they appointed...

279
00:20:47,906 --> 00:20:50,195
那个保护共和的人就是凯撒
...to protect the republic was named caesar...

280
00:20:50,367 --> 00:20:53,783
-一个不愿放弃权利的人  -好吧
...and he never gave up his power. - okay, fine.

281
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:55,283
你要么作为英雄而死...
You either die a hero...

282
00:20:55,456 --> 00:20:58,492
要么苟且偷生 目睹你自己也变成坏人
...or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.

283
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:02,167
不管蝙蝠侠是谁  他不会想一辈子都干这个
Whoever the batman is, he doesn't wanna do this for the rest of his life.

284
00:21:02,338 --> 00:21:05,588
肯定不想  蝙蝠侠在寻找接班人
How could he? batman is looking for someone to take up his mantle.

285
00:21:05,758 --> 00:21:08,046
就像是你么?  登特先生
Someone like you, mr. Dent?

286
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,966
也许吧  若我能胜任
Maybe. if I'm up to it.

287
00:21:11,138 --> 00:21:16,381
若哈维・登特就是十字军呢?
What if Harvey Dent is the caped crusader? hm?

288
00:21:18,646 --> 00:21:21,812
若我晚上偷偷溜出去  早有人发现了
If I were sneaking out every night, someone would've noticed by now.

289
00:21:24,193 --> 00:21:28,321
好吧  登特  我决定为你提供选举赞助
Well, I'm sold, Dent, and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.

290
00:21:28,489 --> 00:21:31,324
谢谢你  但我3年内没打算竞选
That's nice, but I'm not up for reelection for three years.

291
00:21:31,492 --> 00:21:33,401
你不明白
No, you don't understand.

292
00:21:33,577 --> 00:21:36,364
若我作你的赞助人
One fundraiser with my pals...

293
00:21:36,997 --> 00:21:39,120
你就衣食无忧了
...you'll never need another cent.

294
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:55,970
这是搞什么?
What the hell is this?

295
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:00,429
你们也都知道了  我们有个钱仓被抢
As you're all aware, one of our deposits was stolen.

296
00:22:00,604 --> 00:22:03,973
损失一笔小数目  6800万
A relatively small amount, 68 million.

297
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:06,687
谁这么傻来抢咱们
Who's stupid enough to steal from us?

298
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:10,562
微不足道的小虾米  穿着廉价紫衣戴着面具
Two-bit wackjob, wears a cheap purple suit and makeup.

299
00:22:10,739 --> 00:22:12,696
他不是问题  无足轻重
He's not the problem. he's a nobody.

300
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:16,235
问题在于我们的钱被警察跟踪了
The problem is our money being tracked by the cops.

301
00:22:16,412 --> 00:22:18,903
多亏玛偌尼先生安排得好
Thanks to mr. Maroni's well-placed sources...

302
00:22:19,081 --> 00:22:20,779
我们知道警方确实使用
... we know that police have indeed

303
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,865
有标记的钞票确认了我们的银行
IDentified our banks using marked bills..

304
00:22:23,043 --> 00:22:25,534
并准备今天没收你们的财产
... and are planning to seize your funds today.

305
00:22:25,713 --> 00:22:27,611
既然热心的新任地方检察官把
And since the enthusiastic new d a has

306
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,710
我所有的竞争者都干掉了
Put all my competitors out of business..

307
00:22:30,342 --> 00:22:33,842
-我是你们唯一的选择  -那么你有什么计划?
...i'm your only option. so, what are you proposing?

308
00:22:34,013 --> 00:22:37,678
把钱都转移到安全地点  不要是银行
Moving all deposits to one secure location, not a bank.

309
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,807
-那是哪儿?  -没人知道  除了我
- where, then? - no one can know but me.

310
00:22:40,561 --> 00:22:43,313
若警方捉到你们其中任何一人
If the police were to gain leverage over one of you...

311
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,272
所有人的钱都完蛋
... everyone's money would be at stake.

312
00:22:45,441 --> 00:22:47,564
那为何他们不会找上你呢?
What stop them getting to you?

313
00:22:47,735 --> 00:22:50,819
我正去往香港  登特鞭长莫及
I go to hong kong, far from Dent's jurisdiction...

314
00:22:51,196 --> 00:22:54,067
且中国人不会引渡自己人
... and the chinese will not extradite one of their own.

315
00:22:54,241 --> 00:22:55,866
你需要多久来转移钱
How soon can you move the money?

316
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,239
我已经转移了
I already have.

317
00:22:59,622 --> 00:23:02,243
显然来不及征求你们同意
For obvious reasons, I couldn't wait for your permission.

318
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:06,540
请放心  你们的钱很安全
Rest assured, your money is safe.

319
00:23:18,891 --> 00:23:21,133
我以为我的笑话够不好笑了
And I thought my jokes were bad.

320
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,394
给我一个不要轰掉你脑壳的理由
Give me one reason why I shouldn't have my boy pull your head off.

321
00:23:24,563 --> 00:23:25,844
变个戏法如何?
How about a magic trick?

322
00:23:29,193 --> 00:23:31,518
我要让这支铅笔..消失
I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.

323
00:23:33,822 --> 00:23:34,937
嗒哒~
Ta-da!

324
00:23:35,115 --> 00:23:36,610
看...
It's...

325
00:23:36,784 --> 00:23:39,072
不见啦
It's gone.

326
00:23:39,453 --> 00:23:41,778
哦  顺便提一下  这西装可不便宜
Oh, and by the way, the suit, it wasn't cheap.

327
00:23:41,956 --> 00:23:44,791
-你们有权知道  你们买的单嘛  -坐下
- you ought to know, you bought it. sit.

328
00:23:45,876 --> 00:23:48,913
我想听听他有什么高见
I want to hear proposition.

329
00:23:51,632 --> 00:23:54,123
让我们把时钟拨回一年前
Let's wind the clocks back a year.

330
00:23:54,468 --> 00:24:00,138
那些警察和律师不敢动你们一根毫毛
These cops and lawyers wouldn't dare cross any of you.

331
00:24:01,308 --> 00:24:03,431
现在呢?  都怎么了?
I mean, what happened?

332
00:24:03,602 --> 00:24:07,386
茄子被霜打了？
Did your balls drop off? hm?

333
00:24:07,564 --> 00:24:09,604
像我这样的人...
You see, a guy like me...

334
00:24:10,067 --> 00:24:12,819
-怪胎  -就是...
- a freak. damn right.

335
00:24:12,987 --> 00:24:16,106
像我这样的人...听着
A guy like me... look, listen.

336
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:20,951
我知道你们为什么在这大白天
I know why you choose to have your little, ahem...

337
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,824
集会搞什么心理治疗
...group-therapy sessions in broad daylight.

338
00:24:24,331 --> 00:24:27,118
我知道你们为何晚上不敢出门
I know why you're afraid to go out at night.

339
00:24:29,336 --> 00:24:30,996
是蝙蝠侠
The batman.

340
00:24:31,171 --> 00:24:36,414
不幸的是  蝙蝠侠让高谭市认清了你们
See, batman has shown Gotham your true colors, unfortunately.

341
00:24:36,594 --> 00:24:40,093
登特  他仅仅是个开始
Dent, he's just the beginning.

342
00:24:40,681 --> 00:24:45,426
至于电视里那人所谓的计划...
And as for the television's so-called plan...

343
00:24:45,894 --> 00:24:47,768
...蝙蝠侠可无所谓权限
...batman has no jurisdiction.

344
00:24:47,938 --> 00:24:50,512
他会找到这家伙逼他交代的
He'll find him and make him squeal.

345
00:24:50,691 --> 00:24:53,692
会告密的人  我一眼就能看出来
I know the squealers when I see them...

346
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,774
那你的计划是?
What do you propose?

347
00:24:57,948 --> 00:25:00,356
很简单  我们 嗯 杀了蝙蝠侠
It's simple. we, uh, kill the batman.

348
00:25:01,702 --> 00:25:04,656
如果有这么简单  你之前为什么没做
If it's so simple, why haven't you done it already?

349
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,535
如果你有一技之长  做了一定得有回报
If you're good at something, never do it for free.

350
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:09,489
你想要多少
How much you want?

351
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,203
一半
Uh, half.

352
00:25:14,423 --> 00:25:17,175
-你疯了吧  -不  我没有
You're crazy. - no, I'm not.

353
00:25:17,343 --> 00:25:19,466
我没有
No, I'm not.

354
00:25:21,055 --> 00:25:24,471
如果我们不现在解决这个问题
If we don't deal with this now...

355
00:25:24,642 --> 00:25:26,266
很快
...soon...

356
00:25:26,477 --> 00:25:31,388
小甘波一个子儿也拿不到
...little Gambol here won't be able to get a nickel for his grandma.

357
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:33,524
别陪这小丑疯了
Enough from the clown!

358
00:25:33,692 --> 00:25:36,646
我们不要...
Ah, ta-ta-ta. let's not blow...

359
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,358
惹毛这些小家伙们
Shit! ...this out of proportion.

360
00:25:39,531 --> 00:25:42,022
你偷了我们的钱就想这么拍拍屁股走人
You think you can steal from us and just walk away?

361
00:25:42,201 --> 00:25:43,743
我先把话放出来
- yeah. I'm putting the word out.

362
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:46,200
如果谁抓到这个小丑  死擒给50万
Five hundred grand for this clown dead.

363
00:25:46,372 --> 00:25:49,408
活捉100万  这样我可以先教教他礼数
A million alive, so I can teach him some manners first.

364
00:25:50,709 --> 00:25:53,283
好的  听着  你们何不等到想认真谈的时候
All right. so, listen, why don't you give me a call...

365
00:25:53,462 --> 00:25:57,211
再给我打电话?
...when you wanna start taking things a little more seriously?

366
00:25:57,383 --> 00:25:59,256
这是我的名片
Here's my card.

367
00:26:19,363 --> 00:26:21,735
你这人真难找啊
You're a hard man to reach.

368
00:26:24,743 --> 00:26:27,032
刘正在去香港的路上
Lau's halfway to hong kong.

369
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:31,165
如果你之前早说  我就会把他护照扣下
If you'd have asked, I could have taken his passport.

370
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:34,003
银行里留下的全是标记了的钞票
All that was left in the vaults were marked bills.

371
00:26:34,169 --> 00:26:37,455
你的手下一插手进来他们就知道我们要来 
They knew we were coming. as soon as your office got involved...

372
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:38,662
我的手下?
My office?

373
00:26:38,841 --> 00:26:40,425
你和那些人渣坐在那
You're sitting down there with scum

374
00:26:40,426 --> 00:26:42,506
就像伍尔兹和莱米斯一样  你还好意思说
Like Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking..

375
00:26:42,678 --> 00:26:45,798
对  你那群菜鸟差点就被敲诈一笔
Oh, yeah. I almost had your rookie cold on a racketeering beat.

376
00:26:45,973 --> 00:26:48,217
别试图掩饰事实  很明显有玛偌尼的人
Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly

377
00:26:48,218 --> 00:26:50,516
混在你的手下之中做内线  登特
Maroni's got people in your office, Dent

378
00:26:53,314 --> 00:26:55,271
我们需要把刘带回来
We need Lau back...

379
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:59,390
但是中国政府无论如何也不会引渡其公民
...but the chinese won't extradite a national under any circumstances.

380
00:26:59,737 --> 00:27:02,441
如果我把他带来给你  你能让他张嘴么
If I get him to you, can you get him to talk?

381
00:27:02,615 --> 00:27:03,813
岂止如此  我还会让他唱歌
I'll get him to sing.

382
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:06,743
我们在追查的是那些暴徒的毕生积蓄
We're going after the mob's life savings.

383
00:27:06,911 --> 00:27:08,155
事情会有难度和风险
Things will get ugly.

384
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:10,617
中尉  我在接受这份工作的时候就知道其中风险
I knew the risk when I took this job, lieutenant.

385
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:12,332
你打算如何将他带回来  有何...?
How will you get him back, any...?

386
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:16,329
他总就是这样的
He does that.

387
00:27:16,503 --> 00:27:20,003
在我未来得及告知我们的中国朋友交易终止之前
Our chinese friends left town before I could tell them the deal was off.

388
00:27:20,174 --> 00:27:23,673
-他们就离开了  -我想你肯定想要去香港
Well, I'm sure that you've always wanted to go to hong kong.

389
00:27:23,844 --> 00:27:26,003
难道打个电话说不行吗
What's wrong with a phone call?

390
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,798
我觉得刘先生值得我们去亲自会面
I think mr. Lau deserves a more personal touch.

391
00:27:31,018 --> 00:27:32,845
现在  为了从高纬度跳下
Now, for high-altitude jumps...

392
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,807
你就需要氧气和稳定器
...you're going to need oxygen and stabilizers.

393
00:27:35,981 --> 00:27:39,599
我不得不说  相比起你以往的要求
Well, I must say, compared to your usual requests...

394
00:27:39,777 --> 00:27:42,350
跳下飞机确实比较直接
...jumping out of an airplane is pretty straightforward.

395
00:27:42,988 --> 00:27:45,111
那要上飞机呢?
What about getting back into the plane?

396
00:27:45,282 --> 00:27:49,114
-我建议去个好的旅行社  -不需要着陆
- I'd recommend a good travel agent. - without it landing.

397
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:53,039
维恩先生  这才差不多
Now, that's more like it, mr. Wayne.

398
00:27:53,582 --> 00:27:56,204
在60年代CIA有一个
The cia had a program back in the'60s...

399
00:27:56,377 --> 00:27:59,710
将其人员带离危险地区的项目叫做天钩
...for getting their people out of hot spots called sky hook.

400
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,549
-我们可以研究这个  -是的
- we could look into that. - yeah.

401
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:04,376
好的  现在
Okay. now...

402
00:28:05,886 --> 00:28:08,591
硬化后的B纤维甲片包裹镀有钛金的
Hardened kevlar plates over titanium-dipped...

403
00:28:08,764 --> 00:28:10,887
绫织纤维来确保弹性
...tri-weave fibers for flexibility.

404
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:13,893
你就可以变得更轻快和灵敏
You'll be lighter, faster, more agile.

405
00:28:17,398 --> 00:28:19,556
也许你应该先看看说明
Perhaps you should read the instructions first?

406
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:21,726
-是的  -但是同样有其弱点
- yeah. - now, there is a tradeoff.

407
00:28:21,902 --> 00:28:25,401
分开的纤维甲片将使得你抵御刀枪的能力变弱
Separation of the plates makes you more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.

408
00:28:25,572 --> 00:28:28,526
有挑战才有意思  不是么?
We wouldn't wanna make things too easy, now, would we?

409
00:28:28,701 --> 00:28:30,740
这个应对狗怎么样
How will it hold up against dogs?

410
00:28:30,911 --> 00:28:33,034
你是说对付大狼狗还是吉娃娃?
We talking rottweilers or chihuahuas?

411
00:28:34,248 --> 00:28:36,739
对付猫是没问题的
Should do fine against cats.

412
00:28:36,917 --> 00:28:39,040
我在亚利桑那州找到了一个
I found one in arizona.

413
00:28:39,211 --> 00:28:42,129
不错的人说他可以在一周内搞定
A very nice man said he could have it up and running in a week...

414
00:28:42,298 --> 00:28:43,377
而且他收现金
...and he takes cash.

415
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:46,384
-那飞行成员呢?  -靠韩国走私者
- what about the flight crew? - south korean smugglers.

416
00:28:46,552 --> 00:28:48,758
他们可以绕过雷达飞入平壤
They run flights into pyongyang, below radar.

417
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:51,681
-你帮我想了不在场证据了么?  -当然
- did you think of an alibi? - oh, yes.

418
00:29:10,451 --> 00:29:13,072
先生  我想这是你的飞机
I believe this is your plane, sir.

419
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:20,790
你看起来很疲倦  阿尔弗雷德  你一个人能行吗
You look tired, Alfred. you'll be all right without me?

420
00:29:22,463 --> 00:29:25,962
如果你能告诉我俄语怎么说"用你自己的防晒霜"
If you can tell me the russian for "apply your own bloody suntan lotion."

421
00:29:37,102 --> 00:29:40,934
甘波  有人找你  他们称已经杀了小丑
Yo, Gambol, somebody here for you. they say they've just killed the Joker.

422
00:29:41,106 --> 00:29:42,933
他们带来了尸体
They brought the body.

423
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:01,824
死的吗  那是50万
So, dead, that's 500.

424
00:30:03,796 --> 00:30:05,587
那活捉的给多少钱呢?
How about alive? hm?

425
00:30:08,801 --> 00:30:11,967
你想知道我怎么弄上这些伤疤的吗
You wanna know how I got these scars?

426
00:30:13,889 --> 00:30:16,890
我爸是个
My father was...

427
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:18,518
酒鬼
...a drinker...

428
00:30:18,686 --> 00:30:19,931
也是一个魔鬼
...and a fiend.

429
00:30:20,771 --> 00:30:24,935
有一天晚上  他比平时还要疯狂
And one night, he goes off crazier than usual.

430
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:28,146
我妈就拿菜刀自卫
Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself.

431
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,862
他不喜欢那样
He doesn't like that...

432
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:33,482
一点也不喜欢
...not one bit.

433
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:36,197
所以我就看着
So, me watching...

434
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:40,948
他拿着刀走向她  一边笑着
...he takes the knife to her, Laughing while he does it.

435
00:30:44,378 --> 00:30:48,043
他转向我说"干嘛这么严肃"
He turns to me and said "why so serious?"

436
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:49,876
他拿着刀走向我
He comes at me with the knife.

437
00:30:50,551 --> 00:30:52,460
"干嘛这么严肃"
"why so serious?"

438
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:57,592
他将刀伸进我的嘴里
He sticks the blade in my mouth.

439
00:30:57,933 --> 00:31:01,848
"我们来画个笑脸"
"let's put a smile on that face."

440
00:31:03,063 --> 00:31:05,270
然后
And...

441
00:31:07,651 --> 00:31:09,193
干嘛这么严肃?
Why so serious?

442
00:31:14,241 --> 00:31:15,735
现在
Now...

443
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:18,151
我们的规模不大
...our operation is small...

444
00:31:18,329 --> 00:31:21,246
但是我们很有潜力...
...but there is a lot of potential...

445
00:31:21,415 --> 00:31:23,953
会急剧扩张
...for aggressive expansion.

446
00:31:24,126 --> 00:31:27,329
所以你们哪位绅士愿意加入我们的团队?
So which of you fine gentlemen would like to join our team?

447
00:31:27,504 --> 00:31:31,917
现在只有一个空缺  那我们就需要
Oh. there's only one spot open right now, so we're gonna have...

448
00:31:32,593 --> 00:31:34,751
挑选一下
...tryouts.

449
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,342
干快一点
Make it fast.

450
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:52,188
福克斯先生  欢迎来到香港
Welcome to hong kong, mr. Fox.

451
00:31:52,363 --> 00:31:55,067
刘先生今天很遗憾不能亲自来迎接你
Mr. Lau regrets he is unable to greet you in person today.

452

我理解

453
00:32:06,961 --> 00:32:10,543
出于安保目的  我们要保管您的手机
For security purposes, I'm gonna have to ask you to check in your mobile.

454
00:32:10,714 --> 00:32:12,292
当然
Of course.

455
00:32:15,052 --> 00:32:18,753
很抱歉我在我们的谈判中途就离开高谭
I must apologize for leaving Gotham in the middle of our negotiations.

456
00:32:18,931 --> 00:32:22,466
由于这个和高谭警方之间的误会
This misunderstanding with the Gotham police force...

457
00:32:22,643 --> 00:32:25,181
-我不能让这威胁到我的公司  -当然
...i couldn't let it threaten my company. - of course.

458
00:32:25,354 --> 00:32:28,521
向你这样大量的商人应该会理解
A businessman of your stature will understand and...

459
00:32:28,691 --> 00:32:32,640
现在既然你在此  我们可以继续
...with you here now, we can continue.

460
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,511
我非常感谢你如此接待带我来到这里
Well, I do appreciate you bringing me

461
00:32:34,512 --> 00:32:36,568
刘先生  但是我...
Out here in such style, mr. Lau, but I re..

462
00:32:38,117 --> 00:32:39,944
我们这里不允许使用手机
We do not allow cell phones in here.

463
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:42,823
抱歉  我忘了我带着手机
I'm sorry. forgot I had it.

464
00:32:42,997 --> 00:32:45,093
我其实是来告诉你
No, I really came to tell you that

465
00:32:45,095 --> 00:32:47,623
我们之间的交易应该暂时缓一缓
Our business deal has to be put on hold

466
00:32:48,168 --> 00:32:51,253
你明白  我们不敢和你这样可能被
You see, we can't afford to be seen to do business with...

467
00:32:52,381 --> 00:32:54,338
起诉的人做生意
...whatever it is you're accused of being.

468
00:32:54,508 --> 00:32:57,082
我认为像您这样大量的商人会理解
I'm sure a businessman of your stature will understand.

469
00:32:57,261 --> 00:33:01,175
福克斯先生  我认为  这事打个电话说就行了
I think, mr. Fox, a simple phone call might have sufficed.

470
00:33:01,348 --> 00:33:04,717
维恩先生不希望你认为他是在故意浪费你的时间
Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think he was deliberately wasting your time.

471
00:33:04,893 --> 00:33:06,518
他只是意外的浪费了时间而已
Just accidentally wasting it.

472
00:33:07,521 --> 00:33:11,685
说得很好  刘先生  "意外的"
That's very good, mr. Lau. "accidentally." very good.

473
00:33:12,484 --> 00:33:13,813
先生
Hey, sir.

474
00:33:32,046 --> 00:33:34,038
从缆车上来看视野更好
There's a better view from the peak tram.

475
00:33:34,214 --> 00:33:36,041
LSI公司的视野如何?
How's the view from lsi holdings?

476
00:33:36,342 --> 00:33:37,884
受限
Restricted.

477
00:33:38,052 --> 00:33:40,044
刘把那里封锁得非常严实
Lau is holed up in there good and tight.

478
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,130
-这是什么  -我让研发部门做的
- what's this? - I had r & d work it up.

479
00:33:42,306 --> 00:33:43,966
发出高频脉冲
Sends out a high-frequency pulse...

480
00:33:44,141 --> 00:33:46,976
以记录绘制一个环境的地图

481
00:33:47,478 --> 00:33:50,051
声纳  就像一个
Sonar. just like a...

482
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,389
潜艇  维恩先生  像一个潜艇

483
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,727
-以及其他设备?  -都安排好了
- and the other device? - it's in place.

484
00:33:55,653 --> 00:33:56,684
维恩先生
Mr. Wayne?

485
00:33:57,905 --> 00:33:59,185
好运
Good luck.

486
00:37:49,178 --> 00:37:52,344
听着  把钱给我们  我们就可以谈
Look, give us the money and we'll talk about making a deal.

487
00:37:52,514 --> 00:37:55,800
钱就是我还活着的唯一原因
The money is the only reason I'm still alive.

488
00:37:55,976 --> 00:37:57,909
你是说  当他们发现
Oh, you mean, when they find out that

489
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:00,104
你帮过我们之后吗  他们会杀了你
You've helped us, they're gonna kill you

490
00:38:00,272 --> 00:38:01,980
-你这是在威胁我的当事人吗?  -不
- are you threatening my client? - no.

491
00:38:02,149 --> 00:38:06,361
我只是在假设你的当事人会协助调查
I'm just assuming your client's cooperation with this investigation.

492
00:38:07,988 --> 00:38:09,648
和其他人一样
As will everyone.

493
00:38:10,991 --> 00:38:14,325
不合作是吧  好的
No? okay.

494
00:38:14,787 --> 00:38:17,788
刘先生  祝你在牢里过得愉快
Enjoy your time in county, mr. Lau.

495
00:38:17,957 --> 00:38:19,451
等等
Wait!

496
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:21,659
我不会给你钱
I won't give you the money...

497
00:38:21,835 --> 00:38:24,836
但是我可以给你所有我客户的名单
...but I will give you my clients, all of them.

498
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:27,337
你充其量只是个会计师
You were a glorified accountant.

499
00:38:27,508 --> 00:38:31,340
你手上能有他们什么来让我们起诉?
What could you possibly have on all of them that we could charge?

500
00:38:31,512 --> 00:38:35,344
我擅长计算  我处理了他们所有的投资
I'm good with calculation. I handled all their investments.

501
00:38:35,516 --> 00:38:37,093
在一个共同的资金池
One big pot.

502
00:38:38,477 --> 00:38:39,805
搞定
Got it.

503
00:38:40,229 --> 00:38:42,056
等一分钟
One minute.

504
00:38:42,856 --> 00:38:45,561
反黑连坐法  如果他们是把钱集在一起
Rico. if they pooled their money...

505
00:38:45,734 --> 00:38:47,526
那么我们可以起诉他们同谋犯罪
...we can charge them as one criminal conspiracy.

506
00:38:47,695 --> 00:38:48,857
起诉他们什么?
Charge them with what?

507
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:51,900
根据反黑连坐法  如果你起诉一个人有罪
In a Rico case, if you can charge one of them with a felony...

508
00:38:52,074 --> 00:38:54,647
那么你就可以起诉他们所有人  太好了
You can charge all of them with it. that's great.

509
00:38:56,036 --> 00:38:57,945
刘先生
Mr. Lau.

510
00:38:58,956 --> 00:39:02,954
对于这个共同资金你有些什么细节可以提供
What kind of details do you have about this communal fund?

511
00:39:03,127 --> 00:39:04,751
-账簿吗?  -无罪释放  人身保护
- ledgers...? - immunity, protection...

512
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,372
一个包机飞回香港  -等你在法庭作证之后
...a chartered plane back to hong kong. - after you testify in open court.

513
00:39:08,549 --> 00:39:10,874
我很好奇  你的客户都被抓起来之后
I'm just curious. with all your clients locked up...

514
00:39:11,218 --> 00:39:13,425
那些钱会怎么样
...what's gonna happen with all that money?

515
00:39:13,596 --> 00:39:16,715
如我所说  我擅长计算
Like I said, I'm good with calculation.

516
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:21,552
他不能到郡立监狱  我会把他关在这里的看守所
He can't go to county. I'll keep him here in the holding cells.

517
00:39:21,729 --> 00:39:24,267
这是什么  你的堡垒吗?
What is this, Gordon, your fortress?

518
00:39:24,565 --> 00:39:27,234
你信任郡立监狱的人吗
Well, you trust them over at county?

519
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:29,228
我不信任这里的人
I don't trust them here.

520
00:39:30,988 --> 00:39:32,482
刘得留下
Lau stays.

521
00:39:32,948 --> 00:39:35,522
我不知道刘先生的旅行安排
Well, I don't know about mr. Lau's travel arrangements...

522
00:39:35,701 --> 00:39:37,492
但是我确实很高兴他回来了
... but I'm sure glad he's back.

523
00:39:37,661 --> 00:39:40,117
放话出去  我们要雇佣小丑
Put word out. we hire the clown.

524
00:39:42,917 --> 00:39:46,748
他是对的  我们必须解决真正的问题
He was right. we have to fix real problem.

525
00:39:47,254 --> 00:39:48,369
蝙蝠侠
Batman.

526
00:39:52,927 --> 00:39:56,841
-我不知道有任何参与...  -他在电视里看来不错
- I'm not aware of any participation... - our boy looks good on the tube.

527
00:39:57,348 --> 00:40:00,099
你真的想在我朋友面前让我难看
You sure you wanna embarrass me in front of my friends?

528
00:40:00,267 --> 00:40:03,932
别担心  他们也要来
Oh, don't worry. they're coming too.

529
00:40:10,778 --> 00:40:12,605
旅途愉快  明年秋天见
Have a nice trip. see you next fall.

530
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,607
712起敲诈案
Seven hundred twelve counts of extortion.

531
00:40:14,782 --> 00:40:17,189
849起诈骗案
Eight hundred and forty-nine counts of racketeering.

532
00:40:17,368 --> 00:40:19,906
246起欺诈案
Two hundred and forty-six counts of fraud.

533
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,914
87起谋杀案
Eighty-seven counts of conspiracy murder.

534
00:40:23,832 --> 00:40:26,952
527起妨碍司法公正
Five hundred and twenty-seven counts of obstruction of justice.

535
00:40:27,378 --> 00:40:28,753
被告如何辩护?
How do the defendants plead?

536
00:40:35,928 --> 00:40:36,959
肃静  肃静
Order in the court.

537
00:40:37,137 --> 00:40:39,628
549宗罪同时起诉
Five hundred and forty-nine criminals at once.

538
00:40:39,807 --> 00:40:42,298
你怎么说服瑟丽罗来听这出闹剧的
How did you convince Surrillo to hear this farce?

539
00:40:42,476 --> 00:40:46,604
她和我一样追求正义  毕竟她是个法官
She shares my enthusiasm for justice. after all, she is a judge.

540
00:40:46,772 --> 00:40:49,808
就算你成功说服索瑞判刑
Even if you blow enough smoke to get convictions out of Surrillo...

541
00:40:49,984 --> 00:40:52,557
也会打破被告上诉的纪录
...you're gonna set a new record at appeals.

542
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:55,227
这没关系  头目会被保释
It won't matter. the head guys make bail, sure.

543
00:40:55,406 --> 00:40:57,813
下边的  就不行了
But the midlevel guys, they can't.

544
00:40:57,992 --> 00:40:59,818
他们负担不起保释金
They can't afford to be off the streets.

545
00:40:59,994 --> 00:41:02,117
他们会终止活动并在监狱里待一段时间
They'll cut deals that include some jail time.

546
00:41:02,288 --> 00:41:05,288
想想你用这18个月的清净时间可以做很多事
Think of all you could do with 18 months of clean streets.

547
00:41:06,834 --> 00:41:09,954
-市长先生  你不能  -不  出去  你们两个
Mr. mayor, you can't... - no, get out. both of you.

548
00:41:14,133 --> 00:41:15,675
请坐
Sit down.

549
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:23,640
公众喜欢你  那就是我放过你胡闹的唯一理由
The public likes you. that's the only reason that this might fly.

550
00:41:23,809 --> 00:41:25,137
但是这也意味着你得独挑大梁
But that means it's on you.

551
00:41:25,311 --> 00:41:28,347
所有人都会来找你麻烦  不光是暴徒们
They're all gonna come after you now, and not just the mob.

552
00:41:28,522 --> 00:41:32,354
政客  记者  警察
Politicians, journalists, cops.

553
00:41:32,526 --> 00:41:35,017
任何钱包不够鼓的人
Anyone whose wallet's about to get lighter.

554
00:41:35,195 --> 00:41:37,865
你准备好这些了吗  但愿吧
Are you up to it? you'd better be.

555
00:41:38,032 --> 00:41:40,155
因为他们一旦找到你的纰漏
Because they get anything on you...

556
00:41:40,326 --> 00:41:42,631
罪犯就会被放回街头
...and those criminals are back on the streets,

557
00:41:42,632 --> 00:41:45,118
很快你我就得下台
followed swiftly by you and me

558
00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:46,569
上帝啊
Jesus!

559
00:42:07,728 --> 00:42:10,184
先生  我认为你的筹款晚会会很成功
I think your fundraiser will be a great success, sir.

560
00:42:10,356 --> 00:42:13,025
你认为我为什么想要给哈维・登特办宴会
And why do you think I wanna hold a party for Harvey Dent?

561
00:42:13,046 --> 00:42:16,276
我认为原因和其它你不用我来做的事一样
I assumed it was your usual reason for socializing beyond myself...

562
00:42:16,278 --> 00:42:18,520
比如社交和打击犯罪
...and the scum of Gotham's underbelly:

563
00:42:18,656 --> 00:42:20,447
都是为了让道斯小姐高兴
To try to impress miss Dawes.

564
00:42:20,616 --> 00:42:24,696
非常幽默  但是错了  实际上是为了登特
Very droll, but very wrong. actually, it's Dent.

565
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:27,741
警方公布了在尸体上发现的影带
Police released video footage found concealed on the body.

566
00:42:27,915 --> 00:42:30,536
敏感的观众  小心  会有让人不舒服的画面
Sensitive viewers, be aware. the image is disturbing.

567
00:42:30,709 --> 00:42:32,916
告诉他们你的名字
Tell them your name.

568
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,747
布莱恩・道格拉斯
Brian Douglas.

569
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,665
你是真的蝙蝠侠吗
And are you the real batman?

570
00:42:38,842 --> 00:42:39,874
-不是  -不是吗
No. no?

571
00:42:40,052 --> 00:42:42,009
-不是  -不是?
- no. - no?

572
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:43,887
那你干嘛穿成他的样子
Then why do you dress up like him?

573
00:42:46,642 --> 00:42:50,722
因为他是我们不惧怕你们这种恶徒的象征
Because he's a symbol that we don't have to be afraid of scum like you.

574
00:42:50,896 --> 00:42:54,230
是啊  你是不怕  布莱恩  确实不怕
Yeah. you do, Brian. you really do.

575
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,018
是吗  嘘  嘘
Huh? yeah. oh, shh, shh, shh.

576
00:42:58,195 --> 00:43:02,656
你认为蝙蝠侠可以让高谭成为更好的地方吗?
So you think batman's made Gotham a better place? hm?

577
00:43:02,866 --> 00:43:04,409
看着我
Look at me.

578
00:43:04,577 --> 00:43:06,865
看着我
Look at me!

579
00:43:10,624 --> 00:43:14,124
你看到了  蝙蝠侠把高谭搞得多么疯狂
You see, this is how crazy batman's made Gotham.

580
00:43:14,295 --> 00:43:16,583
你想要高谭恢复秩序
You want order in Gotham...

581
00:43:16,922 --> 00:43:21,335
那蝙蝠侠必须取下他的面具来向我投降
... batman must take off his mask and turn himself in.

582
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:25,294
只要他一天不这么做  那么就会有人死掉
Oh, and every day he doesn't, people will die.

583
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:27,762
从今晚开始
Starting tonight.

584
00:43:28,183 --> 00:43:30,390
我是个讲信用的人
I'm a man of my word.

585
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:50,496
哈维・登特  罪犯克星
Harvey Dent, scourge of the underworld...

586
00:43:50,664 --> 00:43:53,749
居然被一群筹款富商吓坏了。
...scared stiff by the trust-fund brigade.

587
00:43:53,918 --> 00:43:55,163
-我马上回来  -瑞秋
- I'll be back. - Rachel.

588
00:43:55,336 --> 00:43:58,171
登特先生要来一点酒壮胆吗
A little liquid courage, mr. Dent?

589
00:43:58,339 --> 00:44:00,746
-谢谢  阿尔弗雷德是吧  -对  先生
- thank you. Alfred, right? - that's right, sir.

590
00:44:00,925 --> 00:44:04,210
瑞秋常常提起你  说你了解她所有的事
Rachel talks about you all the time. you've known her her whole life.

591
00:44:04,386 --> 00:44:05,631
还不至于  先生
Not yet, sir.

592
00:44:07,932 --> 00:44:10,173
有没有需要提醒我注意的前男友之类的?
Any psychotic ex-boyfriends I should be aware of?

593
00:44:10,351 --> 00:44:12,592
这很难说哦
Oh, you have no idea.

594
00:44:31,538 --> 00:44:32,949
抱歉我迟到了
I'm sorry that I'm late.

595
00:44:33,123 --> 00:44:35,496
但是我很高兴大家没有我也开始宴会了
I'm glad to see that you all got started without me.

596
00:44:35,668 --> 00:44:39,368
哈维在哪里
Now, where is Harvey? where...?

597
00:44:39,546 --> 00:44:41,954
哈维・登特  今天的男主角
Harvey Dent, the man of the hour.

598
00:44:42,132 --> 00:44:43,461
瑞秋・道斯在哪里
Where's Rachel Dawes?

599
00:44:43,634 --> 00:44:46,006
她是我的老朋友了  过来
She is my oldest friend. come here.

600
00:44:46,178 --> 00:44:48,669
当瑞秋第一次告诉我她在和哈维・登特约会的时候
When Rachel first told me she was dating Harvey Dent...

601
00:44:48,847 --> 00:44:50,046
...我只要说一句
...I had one thing to say

602
00:44:50,266 --> 00:44:52,673
我说"就是到处都是他竞选广告的那个人吗?" 
"the guy from those god-awful campaign commercials?"

603
00:44:52,851 --> 00:44:56,683
"我相信哈维・登特"  非常好的标语
"i believe in Harvey Dent." yeah, nice slogan, Harvey.

604
00:44:56,855 --> 00:44:58,848
但是这引起了瑞秋的注意
But it caught Rachel's attention.

605
00:44:59,024 --> 00:45:02,025
然后我就开始注意到哈维了
And then I started to pay attention to Harvey...

606
00:45:02,444 --> 00:45:05,730
以及所有他作为我们新检察官所做的事
...and all that he's been doing as our new da.

607
00:45:05,906 --> 00:45:07,698
你知道么?
And you know what?

608
00:45:09,743 --> 00:45:11,238
我相信哈维・登特
I believe in Harvey Dent.

609
00:45:11,412 --> 00:45:14,994
我坚信在他的带领下  
I believe that on his watch, Gotham can feel...

610
00:45:15,165 --> 00:45:18,831
高谭会变得更安全  更有前途  
...a little safer, a little more optimistic.

611
00:45:20,254 --> 00:45:24,583
看看他的脸  那是一张高谭光明未来的代表
Look at this face. this is the face of Gotham's bright future.

612
00:45:24,758 --> 00:45:26,917
现在有请哈维・登特讲话
To Harvey Dent. let's hear it for him.

613
00:45:27,303 --> 00:45:28,845
哈维
Harvey.

614
00:45:38,355 --> 00:45:39,814
哈维或许不够了解你
Harvey may not know you well enough...

615
00:45:39,982 --> 00:45:41,939
以至于他并不知道你在开他玩笑
...to understand you're making fun of him...

616
00:45:42,109 --> 00:45:44,102
-但是我知道  -不  我一字一句都是认真的
...but I do. - no, I meant every word.

617
00:45:45,446 --> 00:45:48,363
还记得你曾告诉我
You know that day that you once told me about...

618
00:45:48,532 --> 00:45:50,608
某一天  高谭不会再需要蝙蝠侠
...when Gotham would no longer need batman?

619
00:45:50,784 --> 00:45:52,694
-那天快到了  -布鲁斯
- it's coming. - Bruce.

620
00:45:53,537 --> 00:45:56,083
你不能让我干等
- you can't ask me to wait for that.

621
00:45:56,084 --> 00:45:59,124
那一天正在接近  哈维就是那个英雄
- it's happening now. Harvey is that hero

622
00:45:59,293 --> 00:46:01,022
他关起了这个城市一半的罪犯
He locked up half of the city's

623
00:46:01,023 --> 00:46:03,754
而且他没有戴面具
Criminals, and he did it without wearing a mask

624
00:46:03,923 --> 00:46:06,129
高谭需要能以真面目示人的英雄
Gotham needs a hero with a face.

625
00:46:06,967 --> 00:46:09,256
你本可以不用来参加晚宴的  维恩  我很感激
You can throw a party, Wayne, I'll give you that.

626
00:46:10,638 --> 00:46:12,547
再次感谢
Thanks again.

627
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:15,057
可以借下瑞秋么
You mind if I borrow Rachel?

628
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,893
中尉  从钉在尸体上的小丑扑克牌上
Lieutenant, that Joker card pinned to the body?

629
00:46:21,065 --> 00:46:22,808
法医找到了三组DNA
Forensics found three sets of dna.

630
00:46:22,983 --> 00:46:24,394
-有吻合的么  -全都吻合
- any matches? - all three.

631
00:46:24,568 --> 00:46:28,067
DNA属于瑟丽罗法官  哈维・登特和卢布局长
The dna belongs to judge Surrillo, Harvey Dent and commissioner loeb.

632
00:46:28,238 --> 00:46:30,231
小丑试图告诉我们他的目标
The Joker's telling us who he's targeting.

633
00:46:30,407 --> 00:46:33,278
派一个小组到瑟丽罗的住处  告诉伍尔兹找到登特
Get a unit over to Surrillo's house. tell Wuertz to find Dent.

634
00:46:33,452 --> 00:46:35,492
保护性监视  局长在哪
Protective custody. where's the commissioner?

635
00:46:35,663 --> 00:46:37,157
-市政厅  -封锁大楼
- city hall. - seal the building.

636
00:46:37,331 --> 00:46:39,324
-我到之前不准任何人进出  -知道了
- no one in or out till I get there. - got it.

637
00:46:51,637 --> 00:46:54,009
戈登  你在干嘛
Gordon. what are you up to?

638
00:46:54,181 --> 00:46:57,431
我们暂时安全  我要地毯式搜查整栋大楼
We're secure. I want a floor-by-floor search of the entire building.

639
00:46:57,601 --> 00:47:00,175
抱歉  先生  我们认为小丑对你的生命构成威胁
We believe the Joker's made a threat against your life.

640
00:47:00,354 --> 00:47:01,765
他们都是危险分子  法官
These are dangerous people.

641
00:47:01,939 --> 00:47:03,682
你并没给我提供足够信息
You're not giving me a lot of information.

642
00:47:03,857 --> 00:47:05,815
就连我们也不知道你要去哪
Even we don't know where you're going.

643
00:47:05,985 --> 00:47:09,318
拿着这个信封  打开  会告诉你的目的地
Take the envelope, get in, open it. it'll tell you where you're headed.

644
00:47:13,158 --> 00:47:15,068
你不能把我一个人丢给他们
You can't leave me alone with these people.

645
00:47:15,244 --> 00:47:18,280
所有暴徒都想抓你  你还在担心这些人
The whole mob's after you and you're worried about these guys?

646
00:47:18,455 --> 00:47:20,413
相比而言  我倒不怕那些暴徒
Compared to this, the mob doesn't scare me.

647
00:47:20,583 --> 00:47:24,165
戈登  你可能不会自己发现...
Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this for yourself, so...

648
00:47:24,336 --> 00:47:28,416
相信我  警察局长已经收到许多威胁
...take my word, the police commissioner earns a lot of threats.

649
00:47:28,591 --> 00:47:34,130
很早之前  我就知道该如何应对这种情形
I found the appropriate response to these situations a long time ago.

650
00:47:34,346 --> 00:47:36,588
他们追捕你反而使人看清事实
Them gunning for you makes you see things clearly.

651
00:47:36,765 --> 00:47:38,094
是的  我也相信
Yeah, I bet.

652
00:47:38,267 --> 00:47:42,561
会让你想起你害怕失去的东西
Yeah. it makes you think about things you couldn't stand losing...

653
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:44,722
失去你会共度人生的人
...about who you wanna spend your life with.

654
00:47:44,898 --> 00:47:47,899
-真是沉重的誓言  -除非暴徒有他们自己的方法
- that's a pretty big commitment. - not if the mob has their way.

655
00:47:53,115 --> 00:47:55,820
你需要向我的妻子解释
You get to explain to my wife...

656
00:47:56,744 --> 00:47:58,321
我晚餐迟到的原因
...why I'm late for dinner.

657
00:47:58,495 --> 00:48:01,662
先生  小丑扑克牌上有你的DNA
Sir, the Joker card had traces of your dna on it.

658
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,872
-别那样  -好吧
- don't do that. - all right.

659
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:09,338
-我们认真点吧  -好啊
- let's be serious, then. - okay.

660
00:48:09,673 --> 00:48:10,705
你的答案是什么
What's your answer?

661
00:48:16,889 --> 00:48:18,383
我没有答案
I don't have an answer.

662
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:21,590
他们怎么取得我的DNA的?
How'd they get my dna?

663
00:48:21,769 --> 00:48:23,927
有人可以潜进你的办公室和住处
Somebody with access to your office or house...

664
00:48:24,104 --> 00:48:26,726
可能拿着面纸或者玻璃杯  等等  等
...must have lifted a tissue or a glass... wait! wait!

665
00:48:26,899 --> 00:48:29,816
-那我想没有答案意味着拒绝  -哈维
- well, I guess no answer is a no. - Harvey.

666
00:48:29,985 --> 00:48:32,108
-你心里另有他人  是吧  -哈维
- it's someone else, isn't it? - Harvey.

667
00:48:32,279 --> 00:48:35,446
告诉我不是维恩  那个家伙绝对是...
Just tell me it's not Wayne. the guy's a complete f...

668
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:37,408
你在干什么
What are you doing?

669
00:48:48,587 --> 00:48:49,618
该死的
Oh, shit.

670
00:48:55,803 --> 00:48:57,546
叫医生来
Get a medic!

671
00:49:00,975 --> 00:49:02,089
他们为他而来
They've come for him.

672
00:49:03,602 --> 00:49:04,765
我们成功了
We made it.

673
00:49:07,356 --> 00:49:08,387
躲起来
Stay hidden.

674
00:49:10,651 --> 00:49:13,984
晚安  女士们  先生们
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

675
00:49:16,907 --> 00:49:20,821
我们是今晚的娱乐节目
We are tonight's entertainment.

676
00:49:21,662 --> 00:49:23,987
我只有一个问题
I only have one question:

677
00:49:24,206 --> 00:49:27,741
哈维・登特在哪
Where is Harvey Dent?

678
00:49:37,219 --> 00:49:39,295
你知道哈维在哪  知道他是谁么
You know where Harvey is? you know who he is?

679
00:49:39,471 --> 00:49:40,752
举起手来  小伙子
Hands up, pretty boy.

680
00:49:47,896 --> 00:49:50,684
知道哪里可以找到哈维么  我想和他谈谈
Do you know where I can find Harvey? I need to talk to him.

681
00:49:50,858 --> 00:49:53,693
一点点小事?  不知道  
Just something little, huh? no.

682
00:49:55,988 --> 00:49:58,740
外面怎么了  维恩
What's going on out there? Wayne!

683
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,576
谢天谢地  你还有个暗室
Oh, thank god, you've got a panic room.

684
00:50:01,744 --> 00:50:02,906
嘿  等等
Hey, wait...

685
00:50:03,495 --> 00:50:05,287
你开玩笑吧
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

686
00:50:05,581 --> 00:50:07,573
要知道  我会找到他最爱的人
You know, I'll settle for his loved ones.

687
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:11,249
我们不会惧怕匪徒的
We're not intimidated by thugs.

688
00:50:12,212 --> 00:50:13,920
要知道...
You know...

689
00:50:15,549 --> 00:50:18,550
你让我想起了我父亲
...you remind me of my father.

690
00:50:19,011 --> 00:50:20,838
我恨我的父亲
I hated my father.

691
00:50:21,013 --> 00:50:23,052
够了  住手
Okay, stop.

692
00:50:26,894 --> 00:50:29,729
你好啊  美女
Well, hello, beautiful.

693
00:50:31,899 --> 00:50:35,731
你就是哈维的女友吧  
You must be Harvey's squeeze. hm?

694
00:50:36,111 --> 00:50:38,602
真是漂亮
And you are beautiful.

695
00:50:45,537 --> 00:50:49,405
看起来有点紧张  是因为这些疤痕么
You look nervous. is it the scars?

696
00:50:50,334 --> 00:50:52,540
你知道它们是怎么来的么
You wanna know how I got them?

697
00:50:53,754 --> 00:50:56,292
过来  嘿
Come here. hey.

698
00:50:56,674 --> 00:50:58,382
看着我
Look at me.

699
00:50:58,842 --> 00:51:03,588
我曾有个妻子  和你一样漂亮
So I had a wife. she was beautiful, like you...

700
00:51:03,847 --> 00:51:08,059
她告诉我  不要过于担心
...who tells me I worry too much...

701
00:51:08,227 --> 00:51:11,144
她告诉我  应该多笑笑
...who tells me I ought to smile more...

702
00:51:11,313 --> 00:51:16,818
她赌博  欠一屁股高利贷
...who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. hey.

703
00:51:17,236 --> 00:51:19,643
有一天  他们划花了她的脸
One day they carve her face.

704
00:51:20,155 --> 00:51:24,402
我们没钱医治  她受不了了
And we have no money for surgeries. she can't take it.

705
00:51:24,785 --> 00:51:28,284
我只想看到她重新绽放笑容
I just wanna see her smile again. hm?

706
00:51:28,622 --> 00:51:31,540
我想让她知道  我并不在意那些疤痕
I just want her to know that I don't care about the scars.

707
00:51:32,084 --> 00:51:33,626
所以...
So...

708
00:51:34,211 --> 00:51:37,876
我把剃须刀放进嘴里
...i stick a razor in my mouth and do this...

709
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:39,716
然后自残...
...to myself.

710
00:51:40,009 --> 00:51:45,086
你知道吗?  她却不能忍受再看到我
And you know what? she can't stand the sight of me.

711
00:51:45,264 --> 00:51:46,806
就离开了
She leaves.

712
00:51:47,516 --> 00:51:49,924
我看到了可笑之处
Now I see the funny side.

713
00:51:50,811 --> 00:51:52,389
现在的我经常微笑
Now I'm always smiling.

714
00:51:55,816 --> 00:51:59,150
你还挺辣的呀  我喜欢
You got a little fight in you. I like that.

715
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,648
那你肯定爱死我了
Then you're gonna love me.

716
00:52:28,807 --> 00:52:30,005
放下枪
Drop the gun.

717
00:52:30,184 --> 00:52:32,805
可以  你只要摘下你的面具...
Oh, sure. you just take off your little mask...

718
00:52:32,978 --> 00:52:35,185
露出你的真面目  
...and show us all who you really are. hm?

719
00:52:40,819 --> 00:52:42,017
放开她
Let her go.

720
00:52:42,821 --> 00:52:44,232
用词太没创意啦
Very poor choice of words.

721
00:53:07,054 --> 00:53:08,928
你还好么
Are you all right?

722
00:53:11,183 --> 00:53:13,555
以后别再这样了
Let's not do that again.

723
00:53:13,852 --> 00:53:16,343
-哈维还好么  -他很安全
- is Harvey okay? - he's safe.

724
00:53:17,898 --> 00:53:19,227
谢谢
Thank you.

725
00:53:19,566 --> 00:53:20,598
吉姆  已经结束了
Jim, it's over.

726
00:53:20,776 --> 00:53:23,349
只要他们没有联系上刘  我们就可以切断资金来源
As long as they don't get to Lau, we've cut off their funds.

727
00:53:23,529 --> 00:53:25,023
起诉已经结束了
The prosecution's over.

728
00:53:25,197 --> 00:53:26,857
没人愿意当法官审理这个案子了...
Nobody's standing up in front of a judge...

729
00:53:27,032 --> 00:53:30,033
因为警局局长和法官都已经挂了
...while judges and police commissioners are getting blown away.

730
00:53:30,202 --> 00:53:31,994
-登特怎么办  -他会...
- what about Dent? - he's got any sense...

731
00:53:32,162 --> 00:53:33,242
登特已经到半路...
...Dent's halfway to mex...

732
00:53:33,414 --> 00:53:34,991
你们把垃圾放哪?
So where do you keep your trash?

733
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:37,386
你要上庭了
You're due in court.

734
00:53:37,387 --> 00:53:40,283
我要你活着上庭
I need you alive long enough to get you on the record

735
00:53:40,462 --> 00:53:43,499
你保护不了我  你连自己都保护不了
You can't protect me. you can't even protect yourselves.

736
00:53:43,674 --> 00:53:47,007
如果你拒绝合作  就回不来了  你会坐牢的
You refuse to cooperate, you're not coming back here, you go to county.

737
00:53:47,177 --> 00:53:49,633
你算得了自己会在里面呆多久吗
How long do you calculate you'll last in there?

738
00:53:51,056 --> 00:53:52,551
矛头指向我  并不会拿到他们的钱
Targeting me won't get their money.

739
00:53:52,725 --> 00:53:54,551
我知道这些暴徒不会轻易放弃的
I knew the mob wouldn't go down easily...

740
00:53:54,727 --> 00:53:56,803
但这不同  他们已经越过界限了
...but this is different. they crossed a line.

741
00:53:56,979 --> 00:53:58,224
是你先越界的
You crossed the line first.

742
00:53:58,397 --> 00:54:01,813
是你步步紧逼  把他们逼上了绝望的边缘
You squeezed them, you hammered them to the point of desperation.

743
00:54:01,984 --> 00:54:03,627
当他们绝望时
And in their desperation,

744
00:54:03,628 --> 00:54:06,978
就会投靠于他们并不了解的人
They turned to a man they didn't fully understand

745
00:54:07,489 --> 00:54:10,027
阿尔弗雷德  罪犯的心理并不复杂
Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.

746
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,407
我们只需知道他们想要些什么
We just need to figure out what he's after.

747
00:54:12,578 --> 00:54:13,989
尊敬的维恩阁下
With respect, master Wayne...

748
00:54:14,163 --> 00:54:17,117
或许你也不太了解这个人
...perhaps this is a man you don't fully understand either.

749
00:54:17,917 --> 00:54:20,621
很久以前  当我在缅甸时
A long time ago, I was in burma...

750
00:54:20,794 --> 00:54:24,210
我和朋友为当地政府工作
...and my friends and I were working for the local government.

751
00:54:24,381 --> 00:54:26,955
通过贿赂宝石
They were trying to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders...

752
00:54:27,134 --> 00:54:29,969
他们试图获得当地部落首领的忠诚
...by bribing them with precious stones...

753
00:54:30,137 --> 00:54:32,341
但是他们的车队却在仰光的森林里
...but their caravans were being raided

754
00:54:32,342 --> 00:54:34,716
被歹徒袭击
In a forest north of rangoon by a bandit

755
00:54:34,892 --> 00:54:38,177
我们就去寻找宝石
So we went looking for the stones.

756
00:54:38,562 --> 00:54:43,687
但在半年时间里  我们从没遇到和他有过交易的人
But in six months, we never met anyone who traded with him.

757
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:48,316
有一天  我看见一个小孩玩着一颗红宝石
One day, I saw a child playing with a ruby...

758
00:54:48,489 --> 00:54:51,525
足有橘子那么大一颗
...the size of a tangerine.

759
00:54:51,784 --> 00:54:55,153
匪徒扔掉了那些宝石
The bandit had been throwing them away.

760
00:54:55,829 --> 00:54:58,534
-那他们当初为什么要抢呢  -因为他觉得那很好玩
- so why steal them? - because he thought it was good sport.

761
00:54:58,707 --> 00:55:03,665
有些人并不喜欢那些常人偏爱的东西  比如钱
Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money.

762
00:55:03,837 --> 00:55:08,084
他们不被收买  不被欺凌  不可理喻  不会妥协  
They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with.

763
00:55:08,509 --> 00:55:12,341
有些人就想看着这个世界燃烧
Some men just wanna watch the world burn.

764
00:55:32,783 --> 00:55:33,946
先生  你的名字?
Your name, sir?

765
00:55:34,118 --> 00:55:37,284
艾斯和欧查得  你们会在这里找到哈维・登特
Eighth and Orchard. you'll find Harvey Dent there.

766
00:55:50,175 --> 00:55:51,634
查查名字
Check the names.

767
00:55:58,225 --> 00:55:59,933
理查德・登特
"richard Dent."

768
00:56:02,146 --> 00:56:03,225
帕特里克・哈维
"patrick Harvey."

769
00:56:03,522 --> 00:56:04,553
哈维・登特
Harvey Dent.

770
00:56:04,732 --> 00:56:07,733
在你们的人未破坏现场前  我需要10分钟  
I need 10 minutes with the scene before your men contaminate it.

771
00:56:07,943 --> 00:56:10,150
正是因为你  这些人才会死去
It's because of you these guys are dead...

772
00:56:10,321 --> 00:56:11,863
探员
Detective!

773
00:56:14,074 --> 00:56:16,114
给我们一分钟
Give us a minute, guys.

774
00:56:17,328 --> 00:56:18,905
下面是砖块
That's brick underneath.

775
00:56:19,246 --> 00:56:20,906
会让子弹改变方向吗
Gonna take ballistics off a shattered bullet?

776
00:56:21,081 --> 00:56:22,706
不会
No.

777
00:56:24,168 --> 00:56:26,077
指纹
Fingerprints.

778
00:56:34,637 --> 00:56:36,546
不管你要做什么  尽快
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

779
00:56:38,349 --> 00:56:43,057
因为我们找到他下一个目标  他放进了明天的报纸
Because we found his next target. he's put it in tomorrow's paper.

780
00:57:00,371 --> 00:57:02,659
我想这声音还不够响  先生
I'm not sure you made it loud enough, sir.

781
00:57:15,761 --> 00:57:17,884
里斯先生  有什么能帮忙的么
What can I do for you, mr. Reese?

782
00:57:18,055 --> 00:57:21,839
你想让我重新调查LSI的案子?
You wanted me to do the diligence on the lsi holdings deal again.

783
00:57:22,518 --> 00:57:24,807
我发现一些异常之处
Well, I found some irregularities.

784
00:57:25,229 --> 00:57:27,305
他们的执行总裁已经被警察抓起来了
Their ceo is in police custody.

785
00:57:27,481 --> 00:57:30,399
不  他供出了你的数字  不是他们的
No, not with their numbers, with yours.

786
00:57:30,609 --> 00:57:33,694
应用科学  维恩企业的科技部门
Applied sciences. whole division of Wayne enterprises...

787
00:57:33,862 --> 00:57:35,522
一夜之间消失了
...just disappeared overnight.

788
00:57:35,698 --> 00:57:39,945
我查了档案  发现了一些旧文件
I went down to the archives and I started pulling some old files.

789
00:57:41,078 --> 00:57:42,952
别告诉我  你不认得你的宝贝儿
Don't tell me you didn't recognize your baby...

790
00:57:43,122 --> 00:57:46,740
在晚间新闻上狂碾警车
...pancaking cop cars on the evening news.

791
00:57:47,042 --> 00:57:50,246
现在你让整个研发部门继续烧钱
Now you got the entire r & d department burning through cash...

792
00:57:50,421 --> 00:57:53,754
还声称这和军队设计的手机有关
...claiming it's related to cell phones for the army?

793
00:57:53,924 --> 00:57:57,009
你现在还想给他什么  火箭船吗
What are you building for him now, a rocket ship?

794
00:57:58,887 --> 00:58:00,631
我想...
I want...

795
00:58:00,806 --> 00:58:04,720
以后每年拿到1000万美金
...$ 10 million a year for the rest of my life.

796
00:58:07,229 --> 00:58:09,352
让我直说吧
Let me get this straight.

797
00:58:10,566 --> 00:58:13,021
你觉得你的雇主
You think that your client...

798
00:58:13,193 --> 00:58:16,278
不但是世界上最富有最强势的人
One of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world...

799
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:18,024
还是一个每晚赤手空拳
...is secretly a vigilante...

800
00:58:18,198 --> 00:58:20,188
把罪犯打得血肉模糊
...who spends his nights beating

801
00:58:20,189 --> 00:58:22,860
的秘密义警
Criminals to a pulp with his bare hands..

802
00:58:23,037 --> 00:58:26,203
而你的计划是勒索这个人?
...and your plan is to blackmail this person?

803
00:58:33,672 --> 00:58:34,953
祝你好运
Good luck.

804
00:58:37,843 --> 00:58:39,254
当...
When...

805
00:58:40,679 --> 00:58:42,138
拿着吧
Keep that.

806
00:58:48,812 --> 00:58:51,268
这是你的原始扫描
This is your original scan.

807
00:58:52,691 --> 00:58:54,980
这是重新组装过的
Here it is reengineered.

808
00:59:03,202 --> 00:59:06,737
这是他上子弹时留下的拇指指纹
And there's the thumbprint he left when he pushed the round in the clip.

809
00:59:08,749 --> 00:59:09,912
我拷给你一份
I'll get you a copy.

810
00:59:10,125 --> 00:59:13,909
维恩先生  你重新分配研发部门了么
Mr. Wayne, did you reassign r & d?

811
00:59:14,088 --> 00:59:16,579
是的  政府的通讯项目
Yeah. government telecommunications project.

812
00:59:16,757 --> 00:59:18,797
我还不知道我们和政府还有合作
Wasn't aware we had any government contracts.

813
00:59:19,051 --> 00:59:22,052
卢西斯  你知道  我必须保密的
You know, Lucius, I'm playing this one pretty close to the chest.

814
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:24,888
很好
Fair enough.

815
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:29,268
即使是在卢布局长的葬礼上
With no word from the batman...

816
00:59:29,436 --> 00:59:30,931
依然没有蝙蝠侠的消息
...even as they mourn commissioner loeb...

817
00:59:31,105 --> 00:59:34,474
警察们想知道  小丑是否会实现
...these cops have to wonder if the Joker will make good on his threat...

818
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:37,853
他在高谭时报上发的关于市长的讣告
...in the obituary column of the Gotham times to kill the mayor.

819
00:59:39,655 --> 00:59:43,320
我查了所有的数据库  有四种可能性
I've checked all the databases. there are four possibles.

820
00:59:43,492 --> 00:59:45,615
交叉对照一下地址
Cross-reference the addresses.

821
00:59:45,786 --> 00:59:49,784
看看公园那边  越过游行队伍
Look for parkside, overlooking the parade.

822
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,114
我找到一个
I got one.

823
00:59:52,293 --> 00:59:56,290
梅而文・怀特  1502号拉道夫公寓
Melvin White, 1502 Randolph apartments.

824
00:59:56,672 --> 01:00:00,752
暴力袭击  两次被送进阿卡姆疯人院
Aggravated assault, moved to Arkham twice.

825
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,418
你在房顶上发现什么
What do you got on the roof?

826
01:00:41,592 --> 01:00:45,127
我们严阵以待  但老实说  上面有很多窗户
We're tight, but frankly, there's a lot of windows up here.

827
01:00:53,687 --> 01:00:57,732
卢布局长致力于执法
Commissioner loeb dedicated his life to law enforcement...

828
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,189
和社区安全的保护
...and to the protection of his community.

829
01:01:00,361 --> 01:01:02,152
我还记得我上任时
I remember when I first took office...

830
01:01:02,321 --> 01:01:04,859
问他是否继续担任局长
...and I asked if he wanted to stay on as commissioner.

831
01:01:05,032 --> 01:01:10,275
他说他会  前提是我将政治隔绝在他的房门外
And he said he would, provided I kept my politics out of his office.

832
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:17,208
显然他并不是个绕圈子的人  他也没这样做过
Clearly he was not a man who minced words, nor should he have been.

833
01:01:18,379 --> 01:01:21,878
他任局长期间实行的一些政策都不太受欢迎
A number of policies that he enacted as commissioner were unpopular.

834
01:01:22,049 --> 01:01:25,299
使我的办公室成天被电话和信件淹没
Policies that flooded my office with angry calls and letters...

835
01:01:29,682 --> 01:01:31,342
-是谁  -怎么了
- who's that? - what happened?

836
01:01:32,393 --> 01:01:34,266
他们抢了我们的枪
They took our guns.

837
01:01:34,436 --> 01:01:36,228
还有我们的制服
And our uniforms.

838
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:45,571
我们都意识他所做出的牺牲
And as we recognize the sacrifice of this man...

839
01:01:45,739 --> 01:01:49,689
必须铭记这位警官为安全付出了生命
...we must remember that vigilance is the price of safety.

840
01:01:49,868 --> 01:01:52,359
立正  致礼
Stand by. honor guard.

841
01:01:52,538 --> 01:01:56,156
注意  举枪
Attention. port arms.

842
01:01:57,376 --> 01:02:01,753
准备  瞄准  开枪
Ready! aim! fire!

843
01:02:02,548 --> 01:02:04,090
准备  瞄准
Ready! aim!

844
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,092
准备  瞄准
Ready! aim!

845
01:02:18,522 --> 01:02:19,933
趴下  别动
Stay down! don't move!

846
01:02:21,775 --> 01:02:23,435
市长先生  带他出去
Mr. mayor. get him out of here.

847
01:02:32,661 --> 01:02:34,903
-待会见  -你为什么回去
- I'll see you later. - why are you going back?

848
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,582
出去
Get out of here.

849
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,383
告诉我关于小丑的事
Tell me what you know about the Joker.

850
01:03:25,422 --> 01:03:26,751
不
No.

851
01:03:27,174 --> 01:03:28,503
抱歉  芭芭拉
I'm sorry, Barbara.

852
01:03:29,426 --> 01:03:32,676
吉姆  和你姐姐去玩  去吧  宝贝
Jimmy, go play with your sister. go ahead, honey.

853
01:03:32,846 --> 01:03:35,088
如果有我们能帮忙的事
If there's anything we can do, anything you need...

854
01:03:35,266 --> 01:03:37,009
愿意为你效劳
...we're here for you.

855
01:03:40,688 --> 01:03:41,933
你在那里吗
Are you out there?

856
01:03:43,274 --> 01:03:47,770
是你吗  是你给我们带来了灾难  就是你
Are you? you brought this craziness on us. you did!

857
01:03:47,945 --> 01:03:50,317
是你带来的
You brought this on us!

858
01:03:51,365 --> 01:03:55,943
关掉吧  他不会来的  他根本不想和我们说话
Switch it off, he ain't coming. he doesn't wanna talk to us.

859
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:59,371
如果上帝愿意  他会帮忙的
God help whoever he does wanna talk to.

860
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:03,959
不能换个安静点的地方吗?  都听不到谈话了
Can't we go someplace quieter? we can't hear each other talk.

861
01:04:04,128 --> 01:04:06,963
为什么你会认为我想听你说话
What makes you think I wanna hear you talk?

862
01:04:07,131 --> 01:04:08,162
什么
What?

863
01:04:37,578 --> 01:04:39,202
-恩?  -第二个
- yeah? second.

864
01:04:39,371 --> 01:04:40,403

-哈维  你在哪  -你在哪里
- Harvey, where are you? where are you?

866
01:04:42,917 --> 01:04:45,039
我在你应该出现的地方  重案组
I'm where you should be, at major crimes.

867
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:46,753
我这里乱的一团糟
I'm trying to deal with all of this mess.

868

我能看看指纹分析吗

瑞秋  听我说  你那里并不安全

He vouched for these men. - and he's gone.

872
01:05:00,851 --> 01:05:02,927
小丑点名你是下一个受害者
The Joker's named you next.

873
01:05:03,103 --> 01:05:06,104
天啊  镇上还有我们可以相信的人吗
God, is there someone, is there anyone in this town we can trust?

874
01:05:06,273 --> 01:05:07,981
布鲁斯
Bruce.

875
01:05:08,275 --> 01:05:09,438
我们可以相信布鲁斯・维恩
We can trust Bruce Wayne.

876
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:11,187
瑞秋  不行  我知道你是他的朋友  但是
No. Rachel, I know you're his friend, but...

877
01:05:11,362 --> 01:05:13,188
哈维  相信我
Harvey, trust me.

878
01:05:13,364 --> 01:05:16,115
布鲁斯的楼顶阁楼是整个城市最安全的地方
Bruce's penthouse is now the safest place in the city.

879
01:05:16,283 --> 01:05:17,612
那你去吧
Then you go straight there.

880
01:05:17,785 --> 01:05:19,908
不要告诉其他人  我们在那见面
Don't tell anybody and I'll find you there.

881
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:21,787
我爱你
I love you.

882
01:05:35,803 --> 01:05:37,048
我要见到小丑
I want the Joker.

883
01:05:38,264 --> 01:05:39,924
不管从事什么职业
From one professional to another...

884
01:05:40,099 --> 01:05:42,637
...如果你想吓唬别人  选个好地方吧
...you're trying to scare somebody, pick a better spot.

885
01:05:42,810 --> 01:05:45,383
这个高度掉下去摔不死我的
From this height, the fall wouldn't kill me.

886
01:05:45,562 --> 01:05:47,140
-我知道  -啊
- I'm counting on it. - huh!

887
01:05:54,530 --> 01:05:57,650
-他在哪  -我也不知道  总是他找我们
- where is he? - I don't know where he is. he found us.

888
01:05:57,825 --> 01:05:59,105
他肯定还有朋友
He must have friends.

889
01:05:59,451 --> 01:06:01,740
朋友?  你见过这个家伙吗
Friends? have you met this guy?

890
01:06:01,912 --> 01:06:03,490
总有人知道他在哪
Someone knows where he is.

891
01:06:03,664 --> 01:06:06,155
没人会告诉你任何事的
Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.

892
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:07,662
他们对你了如指掌
They're wise to your act.

893
01:06:07,835 --> 01:06:11,833
你还有原则  小丑他根本没有任何原则
You got rules. the Joker, he's got no rules.

894
01:06:12,006 --> 01:06:16,881
没人会告诉你的  如果你想要他 只有一个办法
Nobody's gonna cross him for you. if you want this guy, you got one way.

895
01:06:17,052 --> 01:06:18,844
但你已知道那个方法了
But you already know what that is.

896
01:06:19,013 --> 01:06:21,800
只要摘下面具  他就会来找你
Just take off that mask, let him come find you.

897
01:06:23,434 --> 01:06:25,338
如果你继续踌躇不定
Or you can let a couple more people

898
01:06:25,339 --> 01:06:27,514
会有更多的人被杀
Get killed while you make up your mind

899
01:06:29,189 --> 01:06:31,182
想玩游戏吗
You wanna play games?

900
01:06:37,489 --> 01:06:38,521
感觉怎样
How's that feel?

901
01:06:38,699 --> 01:06:41,320
-你不会的  -我不会
- you wouldn't. - I wouldn't!

902
01:06:42,828 --> 01:06:44,453
-你认为我不会吗  -恩

903
01:06:44,622 --> 01:06:46,661
-你认为我不会吗  -恩
- you don't think I will? - mm-mm.

904
01:06:48,042 --> 01:06:51,245
不  不  我不会的
No. no, I wouldn't.

905
01:06:52,463 --> 01:06:55,001
我交由上天来决定
That's why I'm not gonna leave it up to me.

906
01:06:56,008 --> 01:06:59,009
正面  就保住你的脑袋
Heads, you get to keep your head.

907
01:06:59,428 --> 01:07:01,053
反面
Tails...

908
01:07:02,014 --> 01:07:03,045
就不走运了
...not so lucky.

909
01:07:03,432 --> 01:07:06,967
你会告诉我小丑的事吗
So you wanna tell me about the Joker?

910
01:07:16,362 --> 01:07:20,062
-再来一次  -我什么都不知道  不知道
- let's go again. - I don't know anything! god, don't!

911
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,613
早晚会中的  朋友
You're not playing the odds, friend.

912
01:07:23,744 --> 01:07:25,737
再来一次
Let's do it again.

913
01:07:28,582 --> 01:07:30,409
你就这么让运气决定一个人的生死
You'd leave a man's life to chance?

914
01:07:31,168 --> 01:07:34,751
-也不完全是  -他叫托马斯・西夫
- not exactly. - his name's Schiff, Thomas.

915
01:07:34,922 --> 01:07:37,923
他以前是阿卡姆的偏执型分裂性精神病患者
He's a paranoid schizophrenic, former patient at Arkham.

916
01:07:38,092 --> 01:07:42,718
正是小丑感兴趣的类型  你期望从他身上得到什么
The kind of mind the Joker attracts. what do you expect to learn from him?

917
01:07:46,058 --> 01:07:48,845
小丑杀了戈登  下一个目标是瑞秋
The Joker killed Gordon. he's gonna kill Rachel.

918
01:07:49,019 --> 01:07:51,806
你是希望的象征  我不是
You're the symbol of hope I could never be.

919
01:07:51,981 --> 01:07:53,807
你和有组织的犯罪抗争
Your stand against organized crime...

920
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:57,186
是几十年来高谭的法制之光
...is the first legitimate ray of light in Gotham in decades.

921
01:07:57,361 --> 01:08:00,979
如果有人看见你这样做  将会前功尽弃的
If anyone saw this, everything would be undone.

922
01:08:01,156 --> 01:08:03,445
你抓住的罪犯就会被放掉
The criminals you arrested would be released...

923
01:08:03,617 --> 01:08:06,702
吉姆・戈登就死的毫无价值了
...and Jim Gordon will have died for nothing.

924
01:08:07,329 --> 01:08:09,571
明天你举行一个新闻发布会
You're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow.

925
01:08:09,748 --> 01:08:12,121
-为什么  -不会有人因为我而死亡了
- why? - no one else will die because of me.

926
01:08:12,293 --> 01:08:14,618
高谭的命运在你的手上了
Gotham's in your hands now.

927
01:08:14,795 --> 01:08:16,503
你不能这样做
You can't.

928
01:08:16,672 --> 01:08:18,047
你不能屈服
You can't give in.

929
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:20,878
你不能屈服
You can't give in!

930
01:08:36,233 --> 01:08:37,478
哈维来电
Harvey called.

931
01:08:37,651 --> 01:08:40,688
他说蝙蝠侠要自首
He said batman's gonna turn himself in.

932
01:08:40,863 --> 01:08:41,977
我别无选择
I have no choice.

933
01:08:42,156 --> 01:08:45,240
你就这么天真认为小丑会因此不再杀人了么
You honestly think that's gonna keep the Joker from killing people?

934
01:08:45,409 --> 01:08:48,860
或许不会  但我双手已经沾满了鲜血
Maybe not. but I have enough blood on my hands.

935
01:08:49,330 --> 01:08:54,157
我很清楚我要怎么做才能阻止他
And I've seen now what I would have to become to stop men like him.

936
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:58,161
你曾告诉我  在我结束那一天
You once told me that if the day came when I was finished...

937
01:08:58,339 --> 01:09:00,415
我们就可以在一起了
...that we'd be together.

938
01:09:01,133 --> 01:09:04,300
布鲁斯  别让我成为你正常生活的唯一希望
Bruce, don't make me your one hope for a normal life.

939
01:09:05,846 --> 01:09:07,175
你是认真的么
Did you mean it?

940
01:09:08,682 --> 01:09:10,509
是的
Yes.

941
01:09:27,785 --> 01:09:29,576
布鲁斯
Bruce.

942
01:09:30,537 --> 01:09:34,452
如果你自首  他们不会让我们在一起的
If you turn yourself in, they're not gonna let us be together.

943
01:09:45,094 --> 01:09:48,048
-都要烧毁么  -全部
Logs as well? everything.

944
01:09:48,222 --> 01:09:51,591
所有可能追踪到卢西斯和瑞秋的一切
Anything that could lead back to Lucius or Rachel.

945
01:09:56,939 --> 01:10:00,224
-阿尔弗雷德  人们处于生死边缘  -你说要怎么做
People are dying, Alfred. what would you have me do?

946
01:10:00,401 --> 01:10:04,149
忍耐  维恩阁下  接受
Endure, master Wayne. take it.

947
01:10:04,321 --> 01:10:08,022
他们会因此恨你  但这是蝙蝠侠应做的
They'll hate you for it, but that's the point of batman.

948
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:13,740
他会被人遗弃  但他可以做出其他人不能做出的选择
He can be the outcast. he can make the choice that no one else can make.

949
01:10:13,914 --> 01:10:15,243
正确的选择
The right choice.

950
01:10:15,749 --> 01:10:18,786
不是  今天我发现了蝙蝠侠力所不能及的事
No, today I found out what batman can't do.

951
01:10:18,961 --> 01:10:20,206
他不能忍耐下去
He can't endure this.

952
01:10:20,504 --> 01:10:23,375
今天你可以说"我早提醒过你"
Today you get to say "i told you so."

953
01:10:23,966 --> 01:10:27,133
但今天  我不想这么说
Today, I don't want to.

954
01:10:32,975 --> 01:10:34,434
但我还是跟你说过
But I did bloody tell you.

955
01:10:37,479 --> 01:10:40,480
我想他们也会把我关起来...
I suppose they're gonna lock me up as well...

956
01:10:41,275 --> 01:10:42,520
当作你的共犯
...as your accomplice.

957
01:10:42,693 --> 01:10:47,438
共犯?  我要告诉他们整个事情都是你的主意
Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea.

958
01:10:51,702 --> 01:10:55,237
女士们先生们  举行这次招待会有两个原因
Ladies and gentlemen, I've called this press conference for two reasons.

959
01:10:55,414 --> 01:10:57,454
第一件  向高谭说明
Firstly, to assure the citizens of Gotham...

960
01:10:57,625 --> 01:11:01,290
关于小丑杀人案  我们已经竭尽所能
...that everything that can be done over the Joker killings is being done.

961
01:11:02,671 --> 01:11:05,756
第二件  虽然蝙蝠侠愿意自首
Secondly, because the batman has offered to turn himself in.

962
01:11:05,925 --> 01:11:07,632
但让我们仔细想想
But let's consider the situation.

963
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:10,631
我们应该向恐怖分子的要求低头吗
Should we give in to this terrorist's demands?

964
01:11:10,804 --> 01:11:12,263
我们真的认为他会...
Do we really think he's gonna...?

965
01:11:12,431 --> 01:11:15,800
你情愿保护一个有罪的义警  也不选择其他人的生命
You'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante than the lives of citizens?

966
01:11:15,976 --> 01:11:18,348
蝙蝠侠超越了法律的界限
The batman is an outlaw.

967
01:11:19,229 --> 01:11:21,139
但这不是我们为什么要抓他...
That's not why we demand he turn himself in...

968
01:11:21,315 --> 01:11:22,975
我们抓他是因为我们被吓坏了
...we're doing it because we're scared.

969
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:25,937
我们很高兴蝙蝠侠打扫我们的街道直到现在  
We've been happy to let batman clean up our streets till now.

970
01:11:26,111 --> 01:11:29,065
-事情更加严重  -神啊
Things are worse than ever! amen.

971
01:11:30,407 --> 01:11:32,317
是的  确实
Yes, they are.

972
01:11:34,828 --> 01:11:37,829
但是黎明前的夜最黑暗
But the night is darkest just before the dawn.

973
01:11:40,292 --> 01:11:42,368
我保证...
And I promise you...

974
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:44,581
黎明就快来临
...the dawn is coming.

975
01:11:44,755 --> 01:11:46,618
总有一天  蝙蝠侠会为他的
One day, the batman will have to

976
01:11:46,619 --> 01:11:49,298
违法行为做个交代  但是是对我们
Answer for the laws he's broken. but to us..

977
01:11:49,468 --> 01:11:51,211
而不是那个疯子
...not to this madman.

978
01:11:51,387 --> 01:11:53,712
-不能再有警察牺牲了  -没错
- no more dead cops! yeah!

979
01:11:57,017 --> 01:11:58,595
他应该自首
He should turn himself in!

980
01:11:58,769 --> 01:12:01,474
-交出蝙蝠侠  -行了  他在哪里?
Give us the batman! come on! where is he?

981
01:12:04,358 --> 01:12:06,516
-就这么办  -逮捕蝙蝠侠
So be it. take the batman into custody.

982
01:12:06,986 --> 01:12:08,943
什么?  他在这儿?
What? is he here?

983
01:12:09,655 --> 01:12:10,686
我就是蝙蝠侠
I am the batman.

984
01:12:11,031 --> 01:12:14,032
-什么  -行了吧
What? come on.

985
01:12:22,418 --> 01:12:24,327
阿尔弗雷德
Alfred.

986
01:12:25,671 --> 01:12:27,462
他为什么要哈维这样做
Why is he letting Harvey do this?

987
01:12:27,631 --> 01:12:30,632
-他去参加了招待会  -我知道  他只是在旁观
- he went down to the press conference. - I know. he just stood by.

988
01:12:30,801 --> 01:12:32,877
或许  布鲁斯和登特先生都...
Perhaps both Bruce and mr. Dent...

989
01:12:33,053 --> 01:12:36,054
...认为"蝙蝠侠"代表了更重要的东西
...believe that batman stands for something more important...

990
01:12:36,223 --> 01:12:38,548
比恐怖分子的怪念头更重要  道斯小姐
...than the whims of a terrorist, miss Dawes...

991
01:12:38,726 --> 01:12:40,718
即使大家都会因此恨他
...even if everyone hates him for it.

992
01:12:40,894 --> 01:12:43,017
这是他做出的牺牲
That's the sacrifice he's making.

993
01:12:43,188 --> 01:12:46,807
他不仅仅是个英雄  他想代表更多的东西
He's not being a hero. he's being something more.

994
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,984
的确  你非常正确
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

995
01:12:49,153 --> 01:12:52,237
让哈维承担这一切并不是英雄行径
Letting Harvey take the fall for this is not heroic at all.

996
01:12:54,908 --> 01:12:56,533
你比其他人更了解他
You know him better than anyone.

997
01:12:56,952 --> 01:12:57,983
是的
I do.

998
01:13:01,373 --> 01:13:04,410
能帮我把这个给他么  在恰当的时候
Will you give this to him for me? when the time is right?

999
01:13:05,878 --> 01:13:07,076
我怎么知道?
How will I know?

1000
01:13:07,254 --> 01:13:08,748
没有密封
It's not sealed.

1001
01:13:10,174 --> 01:13:11,716
再见了  阿尔弗雷德
Goodbye, Alfred.

1002
01:13:15,888 --> 01:13:17,631
拜  瑞秋
Bye, Rachel.

1003
01:13:25,522 --> 01:13:27,349
我没有时间来解释整个事情
I didn't have time to talk this through.

1004
01:13:27,524 --> 01:13:28,769
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

1005
01:13:28,943 --> 01:13:31,019
他们会把我转运到中央看守所
They're transferring me to central holding.

1006
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:32,572
这是小丑的机会
This is the Joker's chance,

1007
01:13:32,573 --> 01:13:34,985
当他进攻时  蝙蝠侠就会制服他
And when he attacks, the batman will take him down

1008
01:13:35,157 --> 01:13:36,699
听着  这太危险了
Listen. this is too dangerous.

1009
01:13:36,867 --> 01:13:38,116
我们把这家伙送进监狱
We get this guy to county,

1010
01:13:38,117 --> 01:13:40,568
然后就是他们的事了  街道会畅通无阻
He's their problem. the streets will be cleared..

1011
01:13:40,746 --> 01:13:44,447
我们走吧  任何情况都不要停车
...so let's go. the convoys stop for no reason.

1012
01:13:44,625 --> 01:13:46,084
希望你有所行动  兄弟
I hope you got some moves, pal.

1013
01:13:46,252 --> 01:13:49,169
他把你当作诱饵  根本不确定自己能否抓到小丑
He's using you as bait. he doesn't know if he can get the Joker.

1014
01:13:49,338 --> 01:13:50,417
到目前为止他都失败了
He's failed so far.

1015
01:13:50,756 --> 01:13:52,298
你怎么知道他是如何想的
How do you know what he's thinking?

1016
01:13:52,466 --> 01:13:54,791
我就知道  不管如何  这并不只关系着你
I just do. anyway, this isn't just about you.

1017
01:13:54,969 --> 01:13:56,795
那些指望你去振兴这个城市...
What about the people depending on you...

1018
01:13:56,971 --> 01:13:59,971
正义打打击罪犯...
...to clean the city up and do it honorably and...?

1019
01:14:05,646 --> 01:14:08,267
哈维  告诉大家真相
Harvey. tell everyone the truth.

1020
01:14:08,649 --> 01:14:10,523
正面  代表我会成功
Heads, I go through with it.

1021
01:14:10,734 --> 01:14:12,644
这是你的生命  你不能...
This is your life. you can't leave...

1022
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:15,192
-让运气决定  -我没有
...something like that to chance. - I'm not.

1023
01:14:19,535 --> 01:14:21,942
你自己创造运气...
You make your own luck.

1024
01:14:43,767 --> 01:14:45,760
兄弟  你和其他人一样在这等着
Hey, you wait like everybody else, pal.

1025
01:14:53,402 --> 01:14:55,727
该死的  那是什么
What the hell is that?

1026
01:14:55,904 --> 01:14:58,111
前方障碍  前方障碍
Obstruction ahead, obstruction ahead!

1027
01:14:58,282 --> 01:15:01,485
该死  所有单位从第五大道地下道走  重复
Damn it! all units divert down onto lower fifth. I repeat, exit down.

1028
01:15:01,911 --> 01:15:03,025
出口
Exit down!

1029
01:15:03,203 --> 01:15:05,529
第五大道地下道？ 我们会变成感恩节的烤火鸡
Lower fifth? we'll be like turkeys on thanksgiving.

1030
01:15:38,238 --> 01:15:40,564
上帝啊  快离开这  走
Jesus. come on, get us out of here. let's go.

1031
01:15:42,743 --> 01:15:45,115
听着  我们需要后援  有人在追我们
Listen, we need backup. we've got company.

1032
01:15:45,287 --> 01:15:46,829
我们有麻烦了  伙计们
We got trouble, guys.

1033
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:50,829
武器准备好
Lock and load!

1034
01:16:02,054 --> 01:16:03,429
见鬼  那是什么
The hell was that?

1035
01:16:25,286 --> 01:16:27,955
-这些都是防弹的对吧?  -他需要更厉害的武器
- these are built for that, right? - he'll need something...

1036
01:16:28,122 --> 01:16:29,913
才能打穿这个
...a lot bigger to get through this.

1037
01:16:30,958 --> 01:16:32,417
那是什么
What is that?

1038
01:16:33,752 --> 01:16:35,081
是什么  火箭筒?
What is that, a bazooka?

1039
01:16:43,721 --> 01:16:45,429
我可没想过要来干这个!
I didn't sign up for this!

1040
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:03,109
当心
Look out.

1041
01:17:03,907 --> 01:17:05,070
当心
Look out!

1042
01:17:27,348 --> 01:17:28,462
快 我们走
Come on, let's go!

1043
01:18:15,113 --> 01:18:17,319
哈维  哈维  哈维・登特
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent.

1044
01:18:17,490 --> 01:18:20,326
不好意思  我想开车
Oh, excuse me. I wanna drive.

1045
01:18:25,248 --> 01:18:28,831
全系统扫描  全系统扫描
Scanning all systems. scanning all systems.

1046
01:18:36,301 --> 01:18:38,424
危急关头  需要空中支援  现在!
We gotta get topside. we need air support, now!

1047
01:18:43,933 --> 01:18:45,807
我喜欢这活儿  真好
I like this job. I like it.

1048
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:50,684
严重损坏  准备弹出
Damage catastrophic. eject sequence initiated.

1049
01:19:04,663 --> 01:19:06,157
再见
Goodbye.

1050
01:19:15,256 --> 01:19:18,460
我们已到现场  准备发射
We're on point, ready to give them some of their own medicine.

1051
01:19:24,849 --> 01:19:27,305
这才像话  空中支援
That's what I'm talking about. air cav.

1052
01:19:40,865 --> 01:19:42,573
好了  截住他们
Okay, rack them up.

1053
01:19:42,742 --> 01:19:45,114
截住他们  截住他们
Rack them up, rack them up, rack them up.

1054
01:20:10,854 --> 01:20:12,016
这可不怎么妙
That's not good.

1055
01:20:15,525 --> 01:20:16,723
别玩了  搞什么飞机
Okay, that's not good!

1056
01:20:59,861 --> 01:21:01,937
好了 这才是蝙蝠侠
Now, there's a batman.

1057
01:21:06,242 --> 01:21:07,441
哦 你想玩  放马过来
Ooh, you wanna play. come on.

1058
01:21:10,372 --> 01:21:11,486
来啊
Come on.

1059
01:21:20,632 --> 01:21:21,877
没打中!
He missed!

1060
01:21:35,814 --> 01:21:38,221
你不能在这儿停车  我们目标太大啦!
You can't stop here. we're like sitting ducks!

1061
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:56,329
快点  来啊
Come on, come on.

1062
01:21:59,462 --> 01:22:02,831
来啊 来啊 我等你来撞 来撞啊 来啊
Come on. come on. I want you to do it, I want you to do it. come on!

1063
01:22:05,385 --> 01:22:06,844
来吧
Come on.

1064
01:22:07,512 --> 01:22:10,846
来啊 我等你来撞 来撞啊 来啊 撞我
Come on. I want you to do it, I want you to do it. come on, hit me.

1065
01:22:11,016 --> 01:22:12,640
快来撞我 快 撞我
Come on, hit me. come on, hit me!

1066
01:22:14,769 --> 01:22:15,801
撞啊
Hit me!

1067
01:22:44,215 --> 01:22:46,457
你就先消停会儿给我一分钟
Could you please just give me a minute?

1068
01:22:48,553 --> 01:22:50,380
抓住你了  狗杂种
We got you, you son of a bitch.

1069
01:22:53,683 --> 01:22:57,598
戈...你真喜欢出其不意啊
Gor... you do like to play things pretty close to the chest.

1070
01:22:58,063 --> 01:22:59,771
抓到他了  哈维
We got him, Harvey.

1071
01:22:59,939 --> 01:23:03,391
登特先生!  作为高谭最伟大的英雄有何感想?
Mr. Dent! how does it feel to be the biggest hero in Gotham?

1072
01:23:03,568 --> 01:23:06,854
我不是英雄  高谭很好  他们才是英雄
No, I'm no hero. Gotham's finest, they're the heroes.

1073
01:23:07,030 --> 01:23:08,358
但你和你的手下...
But you and your office...

1074
01:23:08,531 --> 01:23:10,191
一直和蝙蝠侠合作  惩奸除恶
...have been working with the batman all along.

1075
01:23:10,367 --> 01:23:12,158
没有  不过我相信他做的都是好事
No, but I trusted him to do the right thing.

1076
01:23:12,327 --> 01:23:14,403
-比如?  -比如救我
Which was? - saving my ass.

1077
01:23:14,579 --> 01:23:17,497
好了  先生们  够了  让他走吧
All right, people, that's enough. let him be. let him be.

1078
01:23:17,666 --> 01:23:19,575
谢谢你  警探
Thank you, detective.

1079
01:23:19,793 --> 01:23:21,916
我和我漂亮的女友还有约会呢  她很担心我
I've got a date with a pretty upset girlfriend.

1080
01:23:22,087 --> 01:23:24,459
-我知道  检察官先生  -登特先生!
- I figured, counselor. mr. Dent, sir...

1081
01:23:24,631 --> 01:23:28,759
...来给封面照张相怎样?  登特先生!
...how about one for the front page, sir? mr. Dent.

1082
01:23:40,105 --> 01:23:43,271
安静  你们都给我站好!
Stand away! all of you!

1083
01:23:43,441 --> 01:23:46,941
我可不希望处理暴力纠纷的律师有事可干
I don't want anything for his mob lawyer to use, you understand?

1084
01:23:49,197 --> 01:23:51,071
死里逃生?
Back from the dead.

1085
01:23:51,741 --> 01:23:53,283
我...
I, uh...

1086
01:23:53,451 --> 01:23:55,361
...我不能拿我家人的生命来赌
...couldn't risk my family's safety.

1087
01:23:56,663 --> 01:23:58,490
捞到什么料?
What do we got?

1088
01:24:00,166 --> 01:24:04,116
什么都没有  没有吻合的指纹  DNA  甚至牙齿
Nothing. no matches on prints, dna, Dental.

1089
01:24:04,296 --> 01:24:07,047
衣服是订做的  没有标签
Clothing is custom, no labels.

1090
01:24:07,257 --> 01:24:09,380
他口袋里只有刀和布
Nothing in his pockets but knives and lint.

1091
01:24:09,551 --> 01:24:11,460
甚至套不出名字
No name.

1092
01:24:11,803 --> 01:24:13,760
-没有化名  -回家吧  戈登
- no other alias. go home, Gordon.

1093
01:24:13,930 --> 01:24:17,014
小丑要关到早上呢  你去休息吧
The clown'll keep till morning. go get some rest.

1094
01:24:17,183 --> 01:24:19,010
你需要休息
You're gonna need it.

1095
01:24:19,269 --> 01:24:21,842
明天你将会正式升职
Tomorrow you take the big job.

1096
01:24:22,522 --> 01:24:25,689
不用说什么了  戈登局长
You don't have any say in the matter. commissioner Gordon.

1097
01:24:41,541 --> 01:24:43,664
对不起  我不能拿你冒险
I'm sorry, I couldn't risk your safety.

1098
01:24:50,175 --> 01:24:51,586
看看这些丑陋的混蛋
Look at these ugly bastards.

1099
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,633
-我很不舒服  -你是"警察杀手"啊
- I don't feel good. you're a cop killer.

1100
01:24:53,803 --> 01:24:56,129
没砍头算上天恩赐了
You're lucky to be feeling anything below the neck.

1101
01:24:56,306 --> 01:24:57,883
-求求你们了!  -离栏杆远点儿
- please! - step away from the bars!

1102
01:24:58,058 --> 01:25:00,216
我受伤了!
My insides hurt.

1103
01:25:14,407 --> 01:25:16,199
爸爸  是蝙蝠侠救了你吗?
Did batman save you, daddy?

1104
01:25:18,370 --> 01:25:20,658
事实上  这次...
Actually, this time...

1105
01:25:20,830 --> 01:25:22,989
...是我救了他
...i saved him.

1106
01:25:34,344 --> 01:25:35,968
他说什么了吗?
Has he said anything yet?

1107
01:25:43,561 --> 01:25:47,773
晚上好  局长大人
Evening, commissioner.

1108
01:25:55,407 --> 01:25:57,613
哈维・登特还没回家
Harvey Dent never made it home.

1109
01:25:57,784 --> 01:25:59,907
-当然没有  -你对他做了什么?
- of course not. - what have you done with him?

1110
01:26:00,829 --> 01:26:02,572
我?
Me?

1111
01:26:04,207 --> 01:26:06,330
我就在这儿啊
I was right here.

1112
01:26:07,752 --> 01:26:09,579
你让谁跟他在一起?
Who did you leave him with?

1113
01:26:09,754 --> 01:26:12,589
你的手下?
Hm? your people?

1114
01:26:13,717 --> 01:26:17,050
假设  他们仍然是你的手下...
Assuming, of course, that they are still your people...

1115
01:26:17,220 --> 01:26:19,925
...而不是马洛尼的手下
...and not Maroni's.

1116
01:26:22,142 --> 01:26:24,514
这话让你难过了吗  局长大人?
Does it depress you, commissioner...

1117
01:26:24,936 --> 01:26:29,894
...意识到自己有多么孤独?
...to know just how alone you really are?

1118
01:26:31,901 --> 01:26:36,777
是不是让你感觉应该对哈维・登特的困境负责?
Does it make you feel responsible for Harvey Dent's current predicament?

1119
01:26:36,948 --> 01:26:39,618
-他在哪儿?  -几点了?
- where is he? - what's the time?

1120
01:26:40,118 --> 01:26:41,612
几点有什么关系?
What difference does that make?

1121
01:26:41,870 --> 01:26:47,326
取决于时间早晚 他可能在一个地方或好几个
Well, depending on the time, he may be in one spot or several.

1122
01:26:53,715 --> 01:26:56,669
-如果你想玩...  -怎样?
- lf we're gonna play games... - mm-hm?

1123
01:26:59,846 --> 01:27:01,803
...我去喝杯咖啡
...i'm gonna need a cup of coffee.

1124
01:27:01,973 --> 01:27:06,053
"好警察  坏警察"的例行节目?
Ah, the "good cop, bad cop" routine?

1125
01:27:06,728 --> 01:27:07,759
不算吧
Not exactly.

1126
01:27:18,281 --> 01:27:19,613
没人"从头打起"的
Never start with the head.

1127
01:27:19,614 --> 01:27:22,326
受害者血肉模糊  他就感觉不到下...
The victim gets all fuzzy. he can't feel the next..

1128
01:27:25,497 --> 01:27:26,611
看见没?
See?

1129
01:27:26,790 --> 01:27:29,115
你想要我  我在这儿了
You wanted me. here I am.

1130
01:27:30,168 --> 01:27:32,291
我想看看你上演的好戏
I wanted to see what you'd do.

1131
01:27:32,837 --> 01:27:35,411
你没让我失望
And you didn't disappoint.

1132
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:38,425
你害死了五个人
You let five people die.

1133
01:27:39,386 --> 01:27:43,051
让登特代替了你
Then you let Dent take your place.

1134
01:27:43,223 --> 01:27:45,844
-就算对我来说  那都算冷血的  -登特在哪儿?
- even to a guy like me, that's cold. - where's Dent?

1135
01:27:46,017 --> 01:27:50,810
那些暴徒希望你消失  他们就可以卷土重来
Those mob fools want you gone so they can get back to the way things were.

1136
01:27:51,314 --> 01:27:56,060
不过我知道  回不去了  你已经改变了大环境
But I know the truth. there's no going back. you've changed things.

1137
01:27:56,236 --> 01:27:58,643
-永远的  -那你还想杀我?
- forever. - then why do you wanna kill me?

1138
01:28:01,616 --> 01:28:03,027
谁说我想杀你了
I don't wanna kill you.

1139
01:28:03,535 --> 01:28:08,078
没有你我能干什么?  欺负下小混混?  才不要
What would I do without you? go back to ripping off mob dealers? no, no.

1140
01:28:08,248 --> 01:28:10,620
不  不  你...
No. no, you...

1141
01:28:10,792 --> 01:28:13,200
你让我变得完整
You complete me.

1142
01:28:13,378 --> 01:28:15,380
你就是个为钱杀人的垃圾
- you're garbage who kills for money.

1143
01:28:15,381 --> 01:28:17,707
别像他们似的说教  你不是他们
- don't talk like one of them. you're not

1144
01:28:17,882 --> 01:28:20,290
就算你想成为他们
Even if you'd like to be.

1145
01:28:21,553 --> 01:28:23,380
其实对他们来说  你也就是个怪胎
To them, you're just a freak...

1146
01:28:24,306 --> 01:28:25,634
...跟我一样
...like me.

1147
01:28:25,807 --> 01:28:28,096
他们现在需要你...
They need you right now...

1148
01:28:28,685 --> 01:28:30,724
...但当事情过去...
...but when they don't...

1149
01:28:31,271 --> 01:28:34,307
...你就会像个麻风病人一样被赶走
...they'll cast you out like a leper.

1150
01:28:34,482 --> 01:28:38,397
你也看到了  他们的道德  法规...
You see, their morals, their code...

1151
01:28:38,653 --> 01:28:40,812
...都多么可笑
...it's a bad joke.

1152
01:28:41,072 --> 01:28:44,406
有事发生  这些道德法规就抛诸脑后
Dropped at the first sign of trouble.

1153
01:28:45,076 --> 01:28:49,074
唯有世界平静  他们才平和  我会让你看到
They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show you.

1154
01:28:49,247 --> 01:28:52,414
到了危急关头  这些...
When the chips are down, these...

1155
01:28:52,584 --> 01:28:54,826
这些文明人...
These civilized people...

1156
01:28:55,003 --> 01:28:57,079
...他们会互相蚕食
...they'll eat each other.

1157
01:28:57,797 --> 01:29:00,170
看好了  我不是怪物
See, I'm not a monster.

1158
01:29:01,551 --> 01:29:02,832
我只是遵从人性
I'm just ahead of the curve.

1159
01:29:05,096 --> 01:29:06,176
登特在哪儿?
Where's Dent?

1160
01:29:06,348 --> 01:29:09,265
你有一大堆原则  你以为原则能救你?
You have all these rules, and you think they'll save you.

1161
01:29:12,354 --> 01:29:14,761
-他还没有失控  -我有一条原则
- he's in control. - I have one rule.

1162
01:29:14,939 --> 01:29:18,024
而且你正要打破这条原则来知道真相
Oh. then that's the rule you'll have to break to know the truth.

1163
01:29:18,193 --> 01:29:19,355
真相是?
Which is?

1164
01:29:19,527 --> 01:29:21,935
唯一明智的生活方式  就是不受任何规则束缚
The only sensible way to live is without rules.

1165
01:29:22,113 --> 01:29:24,783
今晚  你将打破你那最后一条原则
And tonight you're gonna break your one rule.

1166
01:29:24,950 --> 01:29:25,981
我在考虑呢
I'm considering it.

1167
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:28,780
没几分钟了  你必须陪我玩游戏
There's only minutes left, so you'll have to play my game...

1168
01:29:28,954 --> 01:29:31,527
...如果你想救他们中的任何一个
...if you wanna save one of them.

1169
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:33,071
他们?
"them"?

1170
01:29:33,249 --> 01:29:37,294
那时  我还以为你是登特呢
You know, for a while there, I thought you really were Dent.

1171
01:29:37,462 --> 01:29:40,083
你和她的互动...
The way you threw yourself after her.

1172
01:29:46,388 --> 01:29:47,467
你完了
Look at you go.

1173
01:29:53,103 --> 01:29:56,685
哈维知不知道你和他亲亲女友的关系?
Does Harvey know about you and his little bunny?

1174
01:29:57,607 --> 01:29:58,982
他们在哪儿?
Where are they?!

1175
01:29:59,150 --> 01:30:01,143
只有杀戮  才能做出选择
Killing is making a choice.

1176
01:30:01,319 --> 01:30:04,404
-他们在哪儿?!  -两条命选其一
- where are they?! - choose between one life or the other.

1177
01:30:05,156 --> 01:30:09,403
你的检察官朋友  或是他的害羞小娘子
Your friend the district attorney, or his blushing bride-to-be.

1178

...露出最真实最丑陋的一面

这么说来  或许我比你更了解你朋友
So in a way, I knew your friends better than you ever did.

1232

1238
01:34:12,904 --> 01:34:15,691
别  别  马上放下武器

别这么说  他们很快就到
Don't think like that. They're coming.

1249
01:35:18,762 --> 01:35:21,050

I know they are,but I don't want them to.

I love him, and I wanna spend the rest of my life with him.

1273
01:37:17,756 --> 01:37:22,168
我说过  如果高谭不再需要蝙蝠侠  我们就能在一起  
When I told you that if Gotham no longer needed Batman, we could be together...

1274
01:37:22,344 --> 01:37:24,550
...我是真心的
... I meant it.

1275
01:37:24,804 --> 01:37:29,550
但我现在确信你永远都需要蝙蝠侠
But now I'm sure the day won't come when you no longer need Batman.

1276
01:37:30,602 --> 01:37:32,511
但我希望这天能到来

是我害了她吗?

1287

我只想伸张正义...
I was meant to inspire good...

1288
01:38:17,816 --> 01:38:20,188
不是疯狂和死亡
...not madness, not death.

1289
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:24,986
你是扬了善  但你扇了所有罪犯的耳光
You have inspired good. But you spat in the faces of Gotham's criminals.

1290
01:38:25,156 --> 01:38:27,232
你觉得这里不会再有人员伤亡了吗？
Didn't you think there might be casualties?

1291
01:38:27,409 --> 01:38:29,816
置之死地而后生
Things always get worse before they get better.

1292
01:38:30,161 --> 01:38:31,620
阿尔弗雷德  但是瑞秋
But Rachel, Alfred.

和我们坚信的
...what we stand for.

1295
01:38:37,836 --> 01:38:39,294
高谭需要你
Gotham needs you.

1296
01:38:39,838 --> 01:38:42,792
不  高谭需要的是真英雄
No, Gotham needs its true hero...

1297
01:38:43,300 --> 01:38:47,428
...而我还让那个疯子杀人魔把他炸得半死
...and I let that murdering psychopath blow him half to hell.

1298
01:38:47,595 --> 01:38:49,921
这就是为什么  现在...
Which is why, for now...

1299
01:38:50,724 --> 01:38:52,633
...他们要你抓住他
...they're gonna have to make do with you.

1300
01:38:54,853 --> 01:38:56,680
她本来要等我的  阿尔弗雷德
She was gonna wait for me, Alfred.

1301
01:38:58,690 --> 01:39:00,729
登特不知道
Dent doesn't know.

1302
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:02,181
他永远都不会知道了
He can never know.

1303
01:39:04,613 --> 01:39:06,237
这是什么?
What's that?

1304
01:39:06,406 --> 01:39:09,360
-这个以后再说  -缅甸森林的...
- it can wait. - that bandit...

1305
01:39:09,826 --> 01:39:11,949
强盗...
...in the forest in burma.

1306
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:14,160
-你们抓住他了?  -是的
- did you catch him? - yes.

1307
01:39:14,331 --> 01:39:15,659
怎么抓的?
How?

1308
01:39:17,083 --> 01:39:18,708
我们把整座森林烧毁了
We burned the forest down.

1309
01:39:57,958 --> 01:40:00,579
他很可靠  是来自首席顾问军团的M&A律师
He's credible, an m & a lawyer from a leading consultancy.

1310
01:40:00,752 --> 01:40:04,121
他说他等蝙蝠侠惩恶扬善等了很久
He says he's waited as long as he can for batman to do the right thing.

1311
01:40:04,297 --> 01:40:06,373
现在他决定亲自上场
Now he's taking matters into his own hands.

1312
01:40:06,549 --> 01:40:09,503
我们将在五点现场直播蝙蝠侠的真面目
We'll be live at 5 with the true iDentity of the batman.

1313
01:40:25,944 --> 01:40:27,568
对瑞秋的事情我很抱歉
I'm sorry about Rachel.

1314
01:40:30,282 --> 01:40:32,420
医生说你痛苦万分
The doctor says you're in agonizing

1315
01:40:32,421 --> 01:40:35,109
却不接受药物治疗
Pain, but that you won't accept medication

1316
01:40:36,162 --> 01:40:38,120
也拒绝接受...
That you're refusing to...

1317
01:40:38,290 --> 01:40:40,033
...皮肤移植
...accept skin grafts.

1318
01:40:40,375 --> 01:40:42,617
还记得那个名字么...
Remember that name...

1319
01:40:43,211 --> 01:40:45,536
当我在内务部时...
...you all had for me...

1320
01:40:46,006 --> 01:40:48,841
所有人给我起的...
...when I was at internal affairs?

1321
01:40:51,303 --> 01:40:52,583
是什么  戈登?
What was it, Gordon?

1322
01:40:53,263 --> 01:40:54,638
哈维  我...

说出来!
Say it!

1325
01:41:07,319 --> 01:41:10,403
双面人  哈维  双面人
Two-face. Harvey two-face.

1326
01:41:11,990 --> 01:41:16,284
我为什么要掩藏自己的真面目?
Why should I hide who I am?

1327
01:41:17,495 --> 01:41:18,824
我知道你警告过我
I know you tried to warn me.

1328
01:41:19,706 --> 01:41:20,904
对不起
I'm sorry.

1329
01:41:21,541 --> 01:41:24,162
伍尔兹接的你  他在为他们工作吗
Wuertz picked you up. was he working for them?

1330
01:41:26,463 --> 01:41:28,835
你知道是谁接的瑞秋?
Do you know who picked up Rachel?

1331
01:41:29,674 --> 01:41:32,675
哈维  我得知道  我还能相信我的哪些手下
Harvey, I need to know which of my men I can trust.

1332
01:41:33,053 --> 01:41:35,176
为什么现在你倒愿意听我讲了?
Why would you listen to me now?

1333
01:41:36,306 --> 01:41:37,966
抱歉  哈维
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1334
01:41:40,518 --> 01:41:42,310
不
No.

1335
01:41:42,771 --> 01:41:44,894
不对  还没到你懊悔的时候
No, you're not.

1336
01:41:45,940 --> 01:41:47,185
有一天你会的
Not yet.

1337
01:41:52,447 --> 01:41:55,152
这疯狂...确实太过了
This craziness, it's too much.

1338
01:41:55,367 --> 01:41:58,617
早知今日  何必当初把小丑放出来
Should've thought about that before you let the clown out of the box.

1339
01:41:58,787 --> 01:42:00,530
你想要他?
You want him?

1340
01:42:02,999 --> 01:42:05,324
我可以告诉你今下午他在哪
I can tell you where he'll be this afternoon.

1341
01:42:13,385 --> 01:42:15,673
远不及你想的疯狂
Not so crazy as you look.

1342
01:42:15,845 --> 01:42:19,594
早告诉你了  我是守信用的人
I told you, I'm a man of my word.

1343
01:42:22,811 --> 01:42:24,056
那意大利佬在哪儿?
Where is the italian?

1344
01:42:24,229 --> 01:42:27,349
所有作战单位二十分钟到位集合
All tactical units will converge on the location in 20 minutes.

1345
01:42:27,524 --> 01:42:30,975
协作单位封锁所有逃逸线路
I want auxiliary units to cover all possible getaway routes.

1346
01:42:31,569 --> 01:42:32,732
拜托
Please.

1347
01:42:32,904 --> 01:42:36,238
小丑  你会拿这些钱干什么?
Joker-man, what you do with all your money?

1348
01:42:36,908 --> 01:42:39,577
要知道  我品味很简单
You see, I'm a guy of simple taste.

1349
01:42:39,744 --> 01:42:41,404
我喜欢...
I enjoy...

1350
01:42:41,579 --> 01:42:42,955

1353
01:42:49,004 --> 01:42:51,245
-你干什么...?  -啊
- what the...? - ah, ah, ah.

1354
01:42:53,091 --> 01:42:55,926
你知道他们臭味相投在什么地方吗?
And you know the thing that they have in common?

1355
01:42:56,428 --> 01:42:57,708
都是可以拿钱收买的贱人  
They're cheap.

1356
01:42:57,887 --> 01:43:00,557
他们花了多少从你嘴里套出蝙蝠侠是谁?
How much are they paying you to say who batman is?

1357
01:43:00,724 --> 01:43:04,673
这是千载良机  我要刘活着  小丑死活都行 
This is our chance. I want Lau alive. the Joker, either way.

1358
01:43:04,853 --> 01:43:06,264
吉姆  来看看这个
Hey, Jim. get a load of this.

1359
01:43:06,438 --> 01:43:07,766
让我们接进下位观众
Let's take the next caller.

1360
01:43:07,939 --> 01:43:10,098
哈维・登特没想过向这疯子屈服
Harvey Dent didn't wanna give in to this maniac.

1361
01:43:10,275 --> 01:43:11,555
你觉得你更了解情况?
You think you know better?

1362
01:43:11,735 --> 01:43:15,104
我认为如果今天能和登特谈谈  他感觉会大不一样
I think that if we could talk to Dent today, he may feel differently.

1363
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:19,360
希望他能迅速康复  天知道  我们现在有多需要他
And we wish him a speedy recovery. because god knows, we need him now.

1364
01:43:19,534 --> 01:43:21,740
你说过你是守信之人
You said you were a man of your word.

1365
01:43:22,037 --> 01:43:24,076
是啊
Oh, I am.

1366
01:43:25,790 --> 01:43:28,460
我只烧掉我那一半
I'm only burning my half.

1367
01:43:29,794 --> 01:43:31,917
你只在乎钱
All you care about is money.

1368
01:43:32,088 --> 01:43:35,540
这地方得有更高明的罪犯才相配...
This town deserves a better class of criminal...

1369
01:43:35,717 --> 01:43:37,959
...而我这就给他们献上
...and I'm gonna give it to them.

1370
01:43:38,762 --> 01:43:41,253
告诉你手下  现在他们跟我了
Tell your men they work for me now.

1371
01:43:41,431 --> 01:43:43,803
这是我的城市
This is my city.

1372
01:43:44,476 --> 01:43:47,014
他们可不会效命于怪胎
They won't work for a freak.

1373
01:43:47,187 --> 01:43:48,895
"怪胎"
"freak."

1374
01:43:49,064 --> 01:43:51,519
我们干嘛不切成肉片...
Why don't we cut you up into little pieces...

1375
01:43:51,691 --> 01:43:53,150
...喂你的杂种狗?
...and feed you to your pooches? hm?

1376
01:43:53,318 --> 01:43:56,188
让我们看看一条饿狗有多么忠诚
And then we'll see how loyal a hungry dog really is.

1377
01:43:58,198 --> 01:44:00,523
钱算什么...
It's not about money...

1378
01:44:00,700 --> 01:44:03,903
...这是警告
...it's about sending a message.

1379
01:44:04,704 --> 01:44:07,160
一切燃烧吧
Everything Burns.

1380
01:44:09,668 --> 01:44:11,826
-哪位?  我预见到...
- who is this? I had a vision...

1381
01:44:12,003 --> 01:44:14,755
...一个没有蝙蝠侠的世界
... of a world without batman.

1382
01:44:14,923 --> 01:44:17,165
暴徒刚有赢利...
The mob ground out a little profit...

1383
01:44:17,342 --> 01:44:21,256
…警方就试图将其隔离个个击破
... and the police tried to shut them down one block at a time.

1384
01:44:21,429 --> 01:44:24,715
这太乏味了
And it was so boring.

1385
01:44:24,891 --> 01:44:26,848
于是我改了主意
I've had a change of heart.

1386
01:44:27,018 --> 01:44:29,640
可不能让里斯先生坏了事...
I don't want mr. Reese spoiling everything...

1387
01:44:29,813 --> 01:44:34,522
...俗话说得好 独乐乐不如众乐乐
... but why should I have all the fun? let's give someone else a chance.

1388
01:44:34,693 --> 01:44:39,520
如果科勒曼・里斯一小时后还没死…
If Coleman Reese isn't dead in 60 minutes...

1389
01:44:39,698 --> 01:44:41,774
…我就炸掉一家医院
... then I blow up a hospital.

1390
01:44:41,950 --> 01:44:43,527
召集所有警力
Call in every officer.

1391
01:44:43,702 --> 01:44:47,035
到最近的医院疏散并搜索

把所有公车都开到医院

1394
01:44:51,293 --> 01:44:53,160
要紧的是高谭总医院

1395
01:44:53,161 --> 01:44:55,871
紧急疏散那儿所有人

1396
01:44:56,047 --> 01:44:57,707
你  你  还有你  你跟我来
You, you and you, you come with me.

我要你插手  查戈登的手下和他们的家人
I need you plugged in, checking Gordon's men and their families.

1399
01:45:03,346 --> 01:45:05,553

1400

要蝙蝠车么?

1401
01:45:07,559 --> 01:45:09,516
大白天的?  太不低调了
In the middle of the day? not very subtle.

1402
01:45:09,686 --> 01:45:10,966
那就兰博基尼吧
The lamborghini, then.

1403
01:45:11,896 --> 01:45:13,011
低调多了
Much more subtle.

1404
01:45:26,870 --> 01:45:29,361
抱歉  让我过去  抱歉  好
Excuse me. let me through. excuse me. okay.

1405
01:45:29,539 --> 01:45:33,038
长官  能帮帮忙吗?
Sir, could you help, please?

1406
01:45:33,209 --> 01:45:34,917
我得给他找辆公车
I'm gonna find a bus for him.

1407
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:38,754
长官? 局长  您真认为...

01:45:38,923 --> 01:45:41,082
...普通市民会企图杀死这个人?
...an ordinary citizen would try to kill this man?

1409
01:45:45,597 --> 01:45:47,922
长官  长官

把车开到后面!

好  那现在干什么?

我并没先发难

是你的人干的  你的阴谋

1435
01:48:12,535 --> 01:48:14,991
我看上去像有阴谋之人吗?
Do I really look like a guy with a plan?

1444
01:48:39,938 --> 01:48:41,562
我得让这些阴谋家们知道...

1445
01:48:41,731 --> 01:48:47,022
...想掌控一切的企图多可悲
...how pathetic their attempts to control things really are.

1446
01:48:47,988 --> 01:48:51,024
所以我说...过来
So when I say... ah. come here.

1447
01:48:51,533 --> 01:48:55,068
我说这并不是针对你和你女朋友...
When I say that you and your girlfriend was nothing personal...

1448
01:48:56,621 --> 01:48:58,828
...你会了解我并没撒谎
...you'll know that I'm telling the truth.

1449
01:49:01,334 --> 01:49:04,121
-我要你交出武器  -什么?
- I'm gonna need your weapon. - what?

1450
01:49:07,882 --> 01:49:09,709
为什么?  就因为我妻子在医院?
Why? because my wife's in the hospital?

1451
01:49:10,427 --> 01:49:11,969
是的  就这理由
Yeah, that'd be why.

1452
01:49:12,887 --> 01:49:16,091
是这些阴谋家把你弄到这步田地
It's the schemers that put you where you are.

1453
01:49:16,266 --> 01:49:20,050
你就是阴谋家  你密谋...
You were a schemer, you had plans...

1454
01:49:20,228 --> 01:49:22,387
...看看你现在这个样子
...and look where that got you.

1455
01:49:33,158 --> 01:49:35,530
警方采取了一切防范措施...
Police are taking every precaution...

1456
01:49:35,702 --> 01:49:37,825
...警告市民别卷入此事
... urging people not to take matters into their hands.

1457
01:49:37,996 --> 01:49:40,534
我只是发挥所长
I just did what I do best.

1458
01:49:40,707 --> 01:49:44,325
以其人之道还治其人之身
I took your little plan and I turned it on itself.

1459
01:49:44,502 --> 01:49:46,929
看看我都为这城市做了些什么
Look what I did to this city with a

1460
01:49:46,930 --> 01:49:49,841
几桶汽油和几发子弹而已
Few drums of gas and a couple of bullets

1461
01:49:50,008 --> 01:49:53,293
你看我注意到什么?
Hm? you know what I noticed?

1462
01:49:53,470 --> 01:49:57,004
当世界"依计而行"时  无人惊恐
Nobody panics when things go "according to plan."

1463
01:49:57,182 --> 01:49:58,842
即便"计划"可怕无比
Even if the plan is horrifying.

1464
01:49:59,476 --> 01:50:04,517
如果明天我告诉媒体说  某个匪徒将被射杀…
If tomorrow I tell the press that, like, a gangbanger will get shot...

1465
01:50:04,689 --> 01:50:08,141
...或一卡车士兵会被炸死...
...or a truckload of soldiers will be blowing up...

1466
01:50:08,443 --> 01:50:09,522
...没人会惊惶
...nobody panics.

1467
01:50:10,236 --> 01:50:13,321
因为一切都"依计而行"
Because it's all part of the plan.

1468
01:50:13,490 --> 01:50:18,401
但如果我说一位可爱可敬的市长将归西...
But when I say that one little old mayor will die...

1469
01:50:18,662 --> 01:50:21,069
...那人们就会丧失理智
...well, then, everyone loses their minds.

1470
01:50:24,501 --> 01:50:27,418
引入点儿无政府状态...
Introduce a little anarchy...

1471
01:50:28,588 --> 01:50:30,830
...调整既定秩序...
...upset the established order...

1472
01:50:31,007 --> 01:50:35,550
...一切归于混沌
...and everything becomes chaos.

1473
01:50:37,389 --> 01:50:40,140
我是混沌之使
I'm an agent of chaos.

1474
01:50:40,517 --> 01:50:42,842
你知道什么是混沌吗
Oh, and you know the thing about chaos?

1475
01:50:44,896 --> 01:50:46,521
它就是...公平
It's fair.

1476
01:50:55,740 --> 01:50:58,907
-你活  -恩
- you live. - mm-hm.

1477
01:50:59,411 --> 01:51:01,035
你死
You die.

1478
01:51:01,246 --> 01:51:03,238
现在我们谈得来了
Mmm. now we're talking.

1479
01:51:12,590 --> 01:51:14,085
里斯先生
Mr. Reese.

1480
01:51:32,277 --> 01:51:34,435
这不是维恩先生吗
That's mr. Wayne, isn't it?

1481
01:51:34,613 --> 01:51:37,613
-你真英勇  -闯绿灯么?
- that was a very brave thing you did. - trying to catch the light?

1482
01:51:37,949 --> 01:51:40,784
-你不是在保护警车?  -何出此问?  谁在里面?
- you weren't protecting the van? - why? who's in it?

1483
01:51:46,249 --> 01:51:48,325
你觉得我该去医院吗?
Don't you think I should go to the hospital?

1484
01:51:48,501 --> 01:51:50,992
不怎么看新闻吧 维恩先生?
Don't watch a whole lot of news, do you, mr. Wayne?

1485
01:52:57,153 --> 01:52:58,980
东南方
Southeast.

1486
01:52:59,155 --> 01:53:01,362
是高谭总医院
It's Gotham general.

1487
01:53:02,117 --> 01:53:03,777
-你疏散了医院?  -恩
- did you clear the building? yeah.

1488
01:53:06,788 --> 01:53:08,496
弄清楚有多少人在里面
You must know how many were inside.

1489
01:53:08,665 --> 01:53:10,040
你有病员名单  点名
You have patient lists, roll call.

1490
01:53:10,208 --> 01:53:12,533
目前失踪50人 一辆公车
Right now we're showing 50 people missing. one bus.

1491
01:53:12,711 --> 01:53:15,877
其他公车都驶往医院了  我想我们丢了一辆
The other buses were heading off to hospitals. I guess we missed one.

1492
01:53:16,047 --> 01:53:18,170
那你猜哈维・登特在哪里?
What's your guess about where Harvey Dent is?

1493
01:53:18,341 --> 01:53:22,802
继续找  别告诉别人  有人问就说我们救出他了
Keep looking. and keep it to yourself. anybody asks, we got him out.

1494
01:53:25,390 --> 01:53:27,798
给我接市长办公室
Get me the mayor's office on the line.

1495
01:53:28,977 --> 01:53:30,720
我们需要国民警卫队
We're gonna need the national guard.

1496
01:53:30,895 --> 01:53:32,520
仍有人员失踪…
- people are still missing...

1497
01:53:32,689 --> 01:53:33,887
包括本台的迈克・恩格尔
... including gcn's own Mike Engel.

1498
01:53:34,065 --> 01:53:37,315
刚被告知  转到市政厅刚刚收到的消息
I'm now being told that we're cutting to a video gcn has just received.

1499
01:53:37,485 --> 01:53:39,395
我是迈克・恩格尔  高谭晚间报道
I'm Mike Engel for Gotham tonight.

1500
01:53:39,904 --> 01:53:43,238
怎样才能让你们加入?
"what does it take to make you people wanna join in?

1501
01:53:43,408 --> 01:53:45,981
你们没杀死那律师  我得把你们从冷板凳上拉起来…
You failed to kill the lawyer. I've gotta get you off the bench...

1502
01:53:46,161 --> 01:53:47,904
-加入这场游戏  -板凳  游戏
...and into the game. bench. game.

1503
01:53:50,081 --> 01:53:52,204
-夜幕降临吧  这个城市就是我的了  -我的
Come nightfall, this city is mine. mine.

1504
01:53:52,375 --> 01:53:55,127
-离开的人得遵守我的游戏规则  -规则
- and anyone left here plays by my rules. - rules.

1505
01:53:55,420 --> 01:53:58,754
福克斯先生?  安全系统显示研发部门有人侵入
Mr. Fox? security is showing a break-in at the r & d department.

1506
01:53:58,923 --> 01:54:01,046
你若不想加入这场游戏
If you don't wanna be in the game...

1507
01:54:01,217 --> 01:54:02,593
-现在就走  -现在就走
...get out now. - get out now.

1508
01:54:04,763 --> 01:54:07,717
但桥上和隧道的人会有惊喜
But the bridge-and-tunnel crowd are sure in for a surprise.

1509
01:54:43,468 --> 01:54:44,748
高谭 p.d.已关闭…
Gotham p.d. has shut down...

1510
01:54:44,928 --> 01:54:47,383
-亲爱的上帝  -这一地区的桥梁和隧道...
Sweet jesus. ...the area's bridges and tunnels.

1511
01:54:47,555 --> 01:54:50,971
你就不出去做点什么?
Shouldn't you be out there, you know, doing something?

1512
01:54:51,142 --> 01:54:53,100
今天我休息
It's my day off.

1513
01:54:53,728 --> 01:54:55,306
我得方便下
I gotta take a leak.

1514
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:57,805
替我看着点儿  好吗
Keep an eye out for me, will you?

1515
01:55:03,405 --> 01:55:05,362
怎么了?  要我给你把尿?
Now what? need someone to shake it for you?

1516
01:55:05,532 --> 01:55:07,109
你好
Hello.

1517
01:55:07,826 --> 01:55:09,320
登特
Dent.

1518
01:55:09,494 --> 01:55:11,700
天  我以为你死了
Jesus. I thought you was dead.

1519
01:55:11,871 --> 01:55:13,531
一半
Half.

1520
01:55:19,587 --> 01:55:21,165
谁接的瑞秋  伍尔兹?
Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?

1521
01:55:21,339 --> 01:55:23,332
-肯定是马洛尼的人干的  -闭嘴?
- it must've been Maroni's men. - shut up!

1522
01:55:25,093 --> 01:55:27,216
你想告诉我  你还想保护...
Are you telling me that you're gonna protect...

1523
01:55:27,387 --> 01:55:29,130
...戈登那儿的另一个叛徒?
...the other traitor in Gordon's unit?

1524
01:55:29,306 --> 01:55:30,764
我不知道  他没告诉我
I don't know, he never told me.

1525
01:55:30,932 --> 01:55:32,331
听着  登特  我向上帝发誓
Listen, Dent, I swear to god,

1526
01:55:32,333 --> 01:55:34,550
我不知道他们打算把你怎样
I didn't know what they were gonna do to you

1527
01:55:36,104 --> 01:55:37,267
这可有趣了...
That's funny...

1528
01:55:39,024 --> 01:55:41,775
...因为我也不知道在你身上会发生什么
...because I don't know what's gonna happen to you either.

1529
01:55:45,905 --> 01:55:47,815
很美妙  是吧?
Beautiful, isn't it?

1530
01:55:48,199 --> 01:55:49,859
美妙
Beautiful.

1531
01:55:50,410 --> 01:55:51,525
但有违常理
Unethical.

1532
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:54,246
并且危险
Dangerous.

1533
01:55:54,456 --> 01:55:57,955
你把高谭的每一部手机都变成了话筒
You've turned every cell phone in Gotham into a microphone.

1534
01:55:58,126 --> 01:56:00,534
和高频发生接受器
And a high-frequency generator-receiver.

1535
01:56:00,712 --> 01:56:05,789
你盗用了我的声纳概念  运用到城里的每一部电话上
You took my sonar concept and applied it to every phone in the city.

1536
01:56:05,967 --> 01:56:10,546
半个城市都能反馈声纳信息  就能采到整个高谭图像 
With half the city feeding you sonar, you can image all of Gotham.

1537
01:56:12,474 --> 01:56:13,849
这可不行
This is wrong.

1538
01:56:14,017 --> 01:56:16,056
我得找出这个人  卢西斯
I've gotta find this man, Lucius.

1539
01:56:18,063 --> 01:56:19,343
代价呢?
At what cost?

1540
01:56:19,522 --> 01:56:22,310
数据库是无密匙加密
The database is null-key encrypted.

1541
01:56:22,484 --> 01:56:24,690
只有一人可进入此系统
It can only be accessed by one person.

1542
01:56:26,029 --> 01:56:28,187
由一人掌控  这权利太大
This is too much power for one person.

1543
01:56:28,365 --> 01:56:30,523
所以我找你
That's why I gave it to you.

1544
01:56:30,992 --> 01:56:32,190
只有你能驾驭它
Only you can use it.

1545
01:56:32,369 --> 01:56:36,153
我的工作描述并不包括监视三千万人
Spying on 30 million people isn't part of my job description.

1546
01:56:38,375 --> 01:56:39,528
这是个声频示范
This is an audio Sample.

1547
01:56:39,529 --> 01:56:42,075
如果他在市内任何电话频率范围内讲话
If he talks within range of any phone in the city..

1548
01:56:42,253 --> 01:56:44,460
...你就可以将他定位
...you can triangulate his position.

1549
01:56:44,923 --> 01:56:47,414
这次  我就帮你
I'll help you this one time.

1550
01:56:47,884 --> 01:56:49,675
也是最后一次
But consider this my resignation.

1551
01:56:49,844 --> 01:56:54,423
只要这机器在维恩企业内  我就离开
As long as this machine is at Wayne enterprises, I won't be.

1552
01:56:55,183 --> 01:56:57,092
任务完成后...
When you're finished...

1553
01:56:57,769 --> 01:56:58,884
...输入你的姓名
...type in your name.

1554
01:57:07,487 --> 01:57:10,571
我的部下正地毯式搜索隧道和桥梁...
My officers are going over every inch of the tunnels and bridges...

1555
01:57:10,740 --> 01:57:13,943
...但根据小丑的威胁  它们不可能是目标
...but with the Joker's threat, they're not an option.

1556
01:57:14,119 --> 01:57:16,954
-东区道路呢?  -已增援数小时
- and land routes east? - backed up for hours.

1557
01:57:17,122 --> 01:57:20,740
所以三千人准备从渡口离开
Which leaves the ferries with 30,000 ready to board.

1558
01:57:20,917 --> 01:57:23,954
我想用渡船把囚徒转移出岛
I wanna use the ferries so I can get those prisoners off the island.

1559
01:57:24,296 --> 01:57:27,083
你打算撤离的人群?  那可不是我担心的对象
The men you put away? those aren't people I'm worried about.

1560
01:57:27,257 --> 01:57:29,380
你应该担心他们  不管小丑打算干嘛...
You should be. whatever the Joker's planning...

1561
01:57:29,551 --> 01:57:31,605
...最好都将哈维的囚徒考虑进来
...it's a good bet Harvey's prisoners

1562
01:57:31,606 --> 01:57:34,047
我想把他们转移走       
Are involved. I wanna get them out of here

1563
01:57:35,515 --> 01:57:36,713
那哈维在哪儿?
So where is Harvey?

1564
01:57:37,309 --> 01:57:40,475
-还没找到他  -天哪
- we haven't found him. - oh, jesus.

1565
01:57:44,316 --> 01:57:46,392
你能把这事儿压多久?
How long can you keep this quiet?

1566
01:58:00,498 --> 01:58:03,168
一直开  任何情况都别停
Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.

1567
01:58:04,002 --> 01:58:06,160
去见你老婆?
Going to join your wife?

1568
01:58:09,674 --> 01:58:12,165
-爱她吗?  -是的
- you love her? - yes.

1569
01:58:13,053 --> 01:58:16,007
想象过听到她死讯  你会怎样么?
You ever imagine what it would be like to listen to her die?

1570
01:58:16,181 --> 01:58:17,675
听着  这事儿你得找小丑算帐
Look, take it up with the Joker.

1571
01:58:17,849 --> 01:58:21,099
是他杀了你的女朋友  是他把你...
He killed your woman. he made you...

1572
01:58:21,269 --> 01:58:22,300
...变成这样
...like this.

1573
01:58:22,687 --> 01:58:25,688
小丑只不过是一条疯狗
The Joker's just a mad dog.

1574
01:58:25,857 --> 01:58:28,478
我找的是解开链子的人
I want whoever let him off the leash.

1575
01:58:29,194 --> 01:58:32,527
我干掉了伍尔兹  你在戈登局里安排的另一个人是谁?
I took care of Wuertz, but who was your other man inside Gordon's unit?

1576
01:58:32,697 --> 01:58:35,319
是谁接的瑞秋?  一定是她信任的某人
Who picked up Rachel? must have been someone she trusted.

1577
01:58:36,534 --> 01:58:38,657
你看  如果我告诉你...
Look, if I tell you...

1578
01:58:38,828 --> 01:58:39,860
...你会放过我吗?
...will you let me go?

1579
01:58:40,622 --> 01:58:41,950
看运气了
Can't hurt your chances.

1580
01:58:44,709 --> 01:58:46,369
是莱米斯
It was Ramirez.

1581
01:58:51,800 --> 01:58:55,050
-但你说过...  -我说要看你的运气
- but you said... - I said it couldn't hurt your chances.

1582
01:58:58,640 --> 01:59:00,763
幸运小伙
You're a lucky man.

1583
01:59:04,229 --> 01:59:05,972
-可他不是  -谁不走运?
- but he's not. - who?

1584
01:59:08,900 --> 01:59:10,311
你的司机
Your driver.

1585
01:59:23,540 --> 01:59:24,571
靠后
Stand back.

1586
01:59:24,749 --> 01:59:27,075
这可不行  我们才应该上船
Hey, that ain't right. we should be on that boat.

1587
01:59:27,252 --> 01:59:29,825
想和他们一道?  随你便
You wanna ride across with them? be my guest.

1588
01:59:53,069 --> 01:59:54,777
长官  他们关了发动机
Sir, they've stopped their engines.

1589
01:59:54,946 --> 01:59:55,977
好  打开无线电
Right, get on the radio.

1590
01:59:56,156 --> 01:59:59,774
告诉他们  送了这些渣滓就回来接他们
Tell them we'll come back and pick them up once we dump the scumbags.

1591
01:59:59,951 --> 02:00:02,323
自由号  这是灵魂号  回话
Liberty, this is Spirit. come in.

1592
02:00:04,372 --> 02:00:05,570
这什么鬼东西
What the heck was that?

1593
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:08,959
什么玩意儿..?
What the...?

1594
02:00:09,502 --> 02:00:12,788
自由号  进入  这是灵魂号  回话
Liberty, come in, please. this is Spirit. come in.

1595
02:00:14,424 --> 02:00:16,298
自由号  我们遇上同样情况  两台发动机都失灵
Liberty, we have the Same thing. we've lost both engines.

1596
02:00:16,468 --> 02:00:17,962
-自由号  回话  -福克斯
- Liberty, come in. Fox.

1597
02:00:18,136 --> 02:00:20,627
渡船上有情况
There's something going on on the ferries.

1598
02:00:21,389 --> 02:00:23,678
下去发动机室看看
Get down to the engine room now.

1599
02:00:24,309 --> 02:00:26,515
伙计  怎么啦?
Hey, buddy, what's happening?

1600
02:00:35,111 --> 02:00:38,563
船长  发动机室有一百桶炸药装置  还有这个
Captain, we got a hundred barrels down there rigged to blow. and this.

1601
02:00:52,921 --> 02:00:54,748
看上去象引爆器
Looks like some kind of detonator.

1602
02:00:54,923 --> 02:00:57,793
他们干嘛把引爆器给我们?
Why would they give us the detonator to our own bomb?

1603
02:01:00,720 --> 02:01:02,096
今晚  你们都将...
Tonight, you're all gonna...

1604
02:01:02,263 --> 02:01:04,007
...成为社会实验的一部分
... be a part of a social experiment.

1605
02:01:07,852 --> 02:01:11,684
通过柴油机和硝酸铵的魔力
Through the magic of diesel fuel and ammonium nitrate...

1606
02:01:11,856 --> 02:01:15,937
...我随时都可以把你们轰得灰飞烟灭
... I'm ready right now to blow you all sky-high.

1607
02:01:16,111 --> 02:01:18,187
自由号  回话  完毕
Liberty, come in, over.

1608
02:01:19,656 --> 02:01:20,687
失灵了
It's dead.

1609
02:01:21,032 --> 02:01:25,528
倘有任何人企图下船  你们就都得死
If anyone attempts to get off their boat, you all die.

1610
02:01:25,870 --> 02:01:27,151
我正在定位
I'm zeroing in.

1611
02:01:27,330 --> 02:01:31,873
你们有遥控器可以炸掉另一艘船
Each of you has a remote to blow up the other boat.

1612
02:01:32,043 --> 02:01:34,499
他的声音在渡口
His voice is on the ferry...

1613
02:01:34,671 --> 02:01:36,710
...但声音来源不在那儿
...but it's not the source.

1614
02:01:38,967 --> 02:01:40,082
西边
West.

1615
02:01:47,350 --> 02:01:49,639
-戈登  找到小丑位置了
- Gordon. I have the Joker's location.

1616
02:01:49,811 --> 02:01:50,890
埔睿威特大楼
Prewitt building.

1617
02:01:51,062 --> 02:01:53,518
在大厦背面集合
Assemble on the building opposite.

1618
02:01:54,899 --> 02:01:57,687
午夜时分  我要把你们全炸飞
At midnight, I blow you all up.

1619
02:01:57,861 --> 02:02:03,021
但只要你们其中一边按钮  我就放过这条船
If, however, one of you presses the button, I'll let that boat live.

1620
02:02:03,199 --> 02:02:05,322
那么  会是谁被炸上云霄呢
So who's it gonna be?

1621
02:02:05,493 --> 02:02:08,031
是这些哈维・登特最狠的臭名昭著的罪犯们...
Harvey Dent's most-wanted scumbag collection...

1622
02:02:08,204 --> 02:02:11,538
还是那些可爱无辜的平民百姓?
... or the sweet and innocent civilians?

1623
02:02:11,708 --> 02:02:14,246
由你们选择
You choose.

1624
02:02:14,419 --> 02:02:16,328
对了  你们最好快点决定...
Oh, and you might wanna decide quickly...

1625
02:02:16,504 --> 02:02:20,834
因为另艘船上的人可能没这么品德高尚
... because the people on the other boat may not be quite so noble.

1626
02:02:28,224 --> 02:02:29,256
退后
Stay back.

1627
02:02:29,434 --> 02:02:33,218
-你算老几  你说了算?  -至少我们得商量一下
Well, now, who are you to decide? we ought to talk this over, at least.

1628
02:02:33,605 --> 02:02:37,188
不该我们都遭殃  那些人是罪犯
We don't all have to die. those men had their chance.

1629
02:02:37,817 --> 02:02:41,601
-我们不会讨论这个问题  -为什么不?
- we are not going to talk about this. - why aren't we talking about it?

1630
02:02:41,780 --> 02:02:44,353
另一艘船上的人也一样在商量
They're talking over the Same thing on the other boat.

1631
02:02:44,532 --> 02:02:46,821
-我们投票表决  -对!
- let's put it to a vote. yes!

1632
02:02:52,123 --> 02:02:54,697
-你好?  -芭芭拉  我是安娜・莱米斯
- hello? Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez.

1633
02:02:54,876 --> 02:02:57,912
吉姆让你赶快打包  马上把孩子送进车里
Jim needs you to pack up and put the kids in the car right away.

1634
02:02:58,088 --> 02:02:59,796
但是外面有这么多警察...
But the units outside...

1635
02:02:59,965 --> 02:03:01,542
他们靠不住
Those cops can't be trusted.

1636
02:03:01,716 --> 02:03:04,670
吉姆要你尽快离开他们
Jim needs you away from them as soon as possible.

1637
02:03:04,844 --> 02:03:07,798
我先把他们调走10分钟  你们赶快走
I'll call them off for 10 minutes, and you'll have to move fast.

1638
02:03:07,973 --> 02:03:11,804
-但我该把孩子带哪儿去?  -2505号第二街
- but where am I supposed to take them? - 2505 2nd street.

1639
02:03:11,977 --> 02:03:13,850
巡逻车一开走就赶快离开
Leave as soon as the patrol car pulls out.

1640
02:03:14,020 --> 02:03:15,396
好的
Okay.

1641
02:03:15,772 --> 02:03:17,563
她信了你的话?
She believe you?

1642
02:03:17,774 --> 02:03:19,814
因为她相信你...
It's because she trusts you...

1643
02:03:20,151 --> 02:03:21,231
就像当初瑞秋一样
...just like rachel did.

1644
02:03:21,403 --> 02:03:23,479
-我不知道...  -不知道他们会怎么做?
- I didn't know... - didn't know what they'd do?

1645
02:03:23,655 --> 02:03:26,407
你是第二个这么跟我说的警察了
You're the second cop to say that to me.

1646
02:03:26,658 --> 02:03:28,781
你到底觉得他们会怎么干?
What exactly did you think they were gonna do?

1647
02:03:28,952 --> 02:03:31,194
早先他们找到我  付了我母亲的住院费
They got me early on. my mother's hospital bills...

1648
02:03:31,371 --> 02:03:34,407
-别说了  -对不起
- don't! - I'm sorry.

1649
02:03:34,958 --> 02:03:37,413
你还能择日再战  警官
You live to fight another day, officer.

1650
02:03:41,214 --> 02:03:43,041
我们找到了失踪的医院用车
We found the missing hospital bus.

1651
02:03:43,216 --> 02:03:44,924
发现对方持有多名人质
Then we have a hostage situation.

1652
02:03:47,012 --> 02:03:49,004
简直就是射击展览馆
It's a shooting gallery.

1653
02:03:49,389 --> 02:03:51,678
他为什么要选有这么大窗户的地方?
Why would he choose a spot with such big windows?

1654
02:03:51,850 --> 02:03:53,677
我们能很容易瞄准那5个小丑
We have clear shots on five clowns.

1655
02:03:53,852 --> 02:03:56,603
阻击手搞定他们  击碎玻璃  一支小队滑绳进入
Snipers take them out, smash the windows, a team rappels in.

1656
02:03:57,022 --> 02:03:58,516
队伍沿楼梯间行动
Team moves in by the stairwells.

1657

至多有2至3人受伤

1658
02:04:00,984 --> 02:04:02,858
-就这么干  -绝没这么简单
- let's do it. it's not that simple.

1659
02:04:03,028 --> 02:04:05,353
-小丑的计划绝不简单  -简单的是...
- with the Joker, it never is. - what's simple is...

1660
02:04:05,530 --> 02:04:08,697
每过一秒  轮船上的人们就离爆炸近一步
...every second, those people on the ferries get closer to blowing...

1661
02:04:08,867 --> 02:04:11,405
-不会爆炸的  -他会把两艘船都炸了的
- that won't happen. - then he'll blow both of them up!

1662
02:04:11,578 --> 02:04:13,406
我们没时间进行投票了
- we don't have time for paper ballots.

1663
02:04:13,407 --> 02:04:15,326
我希望每个人都把自己的选择...

写到这张纸上

1665
02:04:18,543 --> 02:04:21,378
有人带了笔的话  互相传一下

1672
02:04:37,812 --> 02:04:39,639
我只要5分钟
I need five minutes alone.

1673
02:04:39,814 --> 02:04:41,641
不行  没时间了
No! there's no time!

1674
02:04:41,816 --> 02:04:43,227
我们射击的视野很好
We have clear shots!

1675
02:04:43,401 --> 02:04:46,319
登特就在里面  我们要救他

1676
02:04:46,488 --> 02:04:48,445

1677
02:04:48,615 --> 02:04:49,729

贝塔象限有全面成像

1683
02:05:15,850 --> 02:05:19,219
看起来小丑和人质分布在两层
Looks like clowns and hostages on two floors.

1684
02:05:19,396 --> 02:05:21,803
楼梯间有一支特警队

1685
02:05:25,110 --> 02:05:27,731
还有一队在楼顶

1693
02:06:09,321 --> 02:06:10,815
戴面具的才是人质
The clowns are the hostages.

1694
02:06:11,531 --> 02:06:13,322
红队  上  红队  上

小丑  放下武器
Clowns, put down your guns.

1700

放下武器  扔到地上  马上
Drop your weapons! on the ground, now!

02:07:14,219 --> 02:07:15,678
看上面
Look up.

1705
02:07:16,262 --> 02:07:18,836
看到楼上的那些坏家伙了?
See those bad guys on the floor above?

1706
02:07:19,015 --> 02:07:22,016
他们想突袭从电梯上来的特警队
They're waiting to ambush the swat team coming up the elevator.

1707
02:07:22,477 --> 02:07:23,508
还有60秒
Sixty seconds.

1708
02:07:31,820 --> 02:07:36,398
投票结果  140票反对  396票赞成
The tally is 140 against, 396 for.

1709
02:07:44,541 --> 02:07:47,079
那就这么干  按钮吧
So go ahead. do it.

1710
02:07:47,252 --> 02:07:49,244
我们还没死
We're still here.

1711
02:07:50,422 --> 02:07:53,376
说明他们也没想置我们于死地
And that means they haven't killed us yet either.

1712
02:07:54,843 --> 02:07:56,586
上  上  上
Go, go, go!

1713
02:07:56,761 --> 02:07:58,553
蓝队  做掩护
Blue team, cover!

1714
02:08:04,060 --> 02:08:05,720
上面那层有麻烦了
Trouble on the floor above.

1715
02:08:15,071 --> 02:08:16,447
马上跪到地上
Get down on the ground now!

1716
02:08:24,873 --> 02:08:27,280
不许动  否则我们开枪了
Freeze! stop or we will shoot.

1717
02:08:27,459 --> 02:08:29,451
我们会开枪的  放了那个警官
We will shoot you. drop the officer.

1718
02:08:29,628 --> 02:08:31,170
马上放了那个警官
Release the officer right now.

1719
02:08:31,338 --> 02:08:33,295
马上放了他  双膝跪地
Let him go now! on your knees!

1720
02:08:33,882 --> 02:08:35,958
抓到他了  他出局了
We got him. he's out of the game.

1721
02:08:36,134 --> 02:08:38,625
举起双手  离边缘远点
Keep your hands in the air! step away from the edge!

1722
02:08:46,686 --> 02:08:48,311
停住
Halt!

1723
02:09:01,618 --> 02:09:02,993
趴下  别动
Stay down! don't move!

1724
02:09:03,161 --> 02:09:07,455
更正信息  小丑是人质  医生才是目标
Be advised. clowns are hostages, doctors are targets.

1725
02:09:13,755 --> 02:09:15,913
你成功了  我太激动了
Ah, you made it. I'm so thrilled.

1726
02:09:16,091 --> 02:09:19,257
-引爆器在哪儿  -去咬他
- where's the detonator? - go get him.

1727
02:09:32,649 --> 02:09:35,733
放下武器  不许动
Put down your weapon! don't move!

1728
02:10:07,142 --> 02:10:09,015
你不想死
You don't wanna die...

1729
02:10:09,185 --> 02:10:12,222
但你也不知道怎么取他人性命
...but you don't know how to take a life.

1730
02:10:12,397 --> 02:10:14,057
给我
Give it to me.

1731
02:10:14,357 --> 02:10:18,687
不管怎样  那些人终会杀了你然后拿走它
These men will kill you and take it anyway.

1732
02:10:22,115 --> 02:10:24,606
没人想双手沾满鲜血
No one wants to get their hands dirty.

1733
02:10:24,784 --> 02:10:27,738
好吧  我来
Fine. I'll do it.

1734
02:10:29,414 --> 02:10:32,119
那艘船上的人?  他们也选过了
Those men on that boat? they made their choices.

1735
02:10:32,292 --> 02:10:34,581
他们选了杀人放火  打家劫舍
They chose to murder and steal.

1736
02:10:34,753 --> 02:10:37,956
我们没必要和他们同归于尽
It doesn't make any sense for us to have to die too.

1737
02:10:47,432 --> 02:10:49,888
一切都是如此熟悉
All the old familiar places.

1738
02:10:56,191 --> 02:10:57,270
等一下
Stand by.

1739
02:11:07,619 --> 02:11:11,202
红队  本层安全  所有人质安全救出
Red team, floor secure. hostages are safe.

1740
02:11:11,414 --> 02:11:13,490
把引爆器给我
Give it to me.

1741
02:11:14,918 --> 02:11:18,666
你可以告诉他们  是我抢走的
You can tell them I took it by force.

1742
02:11:19,172 --> 02:11:24,083
给我  我会完成你10分钟前该做的事
Give it to me, and I'll do what you should've did 10 minutes ago.

1743
02:11:46,157 --> 02:11:49,491
我们先别干架  不然会错过美丽的焰火
We really should stop this fighting, otherwise we'll miss the fireworks.

1744
02:11:49,661 --> 02:11:51,488
不会有什么焰火的
There won't be any fireworks.

1745
02:11:51,913 --> 02:11:55,116
预备  走
And here we go.

1746
02:12:34,456 --> 02:12:36,365
你想证明什么
What were you trying to prove?

1747
02:12:36,541 --> 02:12:39,495
每个人的内心都和你一样丑陋?
That deep down, everyone's as ugly as you?

1748
02:12:40,629 --> 02:12:41,660
你注定孤身一人
You're alone.

1749
02:12:48,261 --> 02:12:50,579
这年头真是没人靠得住
Can't rely on anyone these days.

1750
02:12:50,580 --> 02:12:53,766
什么事都得亲自来  不是么
You gotta do everything yourself. don't we

1751
02:12:53,975 --> 02:12:56,810
没事  我有备而来
That's okay. I came prepared.

1752
02:12:57,020 --> 02:12:58,672
我们生活的世界真是其乐无穷
It's a funny world we live in.

1753
02:12:58,673 --> 02:13:01,481
说到这儿  你知道我这些疤怎么来的么
Speaking of which, you know how I got these scars

1754
02:13:01,650 --> 02:13:04,485
不  但我知道这个是怎么来的
No, but I know how you got these.

1755
02:13:22,295 --> 02:13:25,047
你
Oh, you.

1756
02:13:25,215 --> 02:13:28,251
你就是放不下我  对么
You just couldn't let me go, could you?

1757
02:13:29,386 --> 02:13:33,300
就是这样  当不可阻挡的力量
This is what happens when an unstoppable force...

1758
02:13:33,473 --> 02:13:37,934
遇到屹然不动的阻挡
...meets an immovable object.

1759
02:13:38,520 --> 02:13:43,941
你的正义感真是不朽  不是么
You truly are incorruptible, aren't you?

1760
02:13:44,109 --> 02:13:46,813
你不杀我
Huh? you won't kill me...

1761
02:13:46,987 --> 02:13:53,239
因为你错误的自我准则
...out of some misplaced sense of self-righteousness.

1762
02:13:53,410 --> 02:13:56,613
我不杀你
And I won't kill you...

1763
02:13:56,788 --> 02:14:00,572
因为你实在是太好玩了
...because you're just too much fun.

1764
02:14:01,626 --> 02:14:05,790
我觉得我们注定要永远这样
I think you and I are destined to do this forever.

1765
02:14:05,964 --> 02:14:07,956
你会永远呆在精神病院里
You'll be in a padded cell forever.

1766
02:14:08,133 --> 02:14:09,960
也许我们可以共享一个病房
Maybe we could share one.

1767
02:14:10,135 --> 02:14:11,593
你知道么  越来越多的人失去理智
You know, they'll be doubling up...

1768
02:14:11,761 --> 02:14:14,299
很快就会有双人病房
...the rate this city's inhabitants are losing their minds.

1769
02:14:14,472 --> 02:14:17,592
这座城市刚刚向你证明
This city just showed you...

1770
02:14:17,767 --> 02:14:21,812
人们都是一心向善的
...that it's full of people ready to believe in good.

1771
02:14:21,980 --> 02:14:25,147
直到他们的信仰完全破灭
Until their spirit breaks completely.

1772
02:14:26,026 --> 02:14:30,853
直到他们看到哈维・登特真正的一面
Until they get a good look at the real Harvey Dent...

1773
02:14:31,031 --> 02:14:33,818
还有他的"丰功伟绩"
...and all the heroic things he's done.

1774
02:14:35,493 --> 02:14:40,535
你以为  我会冒险  输掉高谭的灵魂之战
You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle for gotham's soul...

1775
02:14:40,707 --> 02:14:43,624
只因为和你互殴?
...in a fistfight with you?

1776
02:14:44,169 --> 02:14:45,711
不
No.

1777
02:14:45,879 --> 02:14:49,295
你需要张王牌
You need an ace in the hole.

1778
02:14:49,466 --> 02:14:51,090
我的王牌是哈维
Mine's Harvey.

1779
02:14:51,468 --> 02:14:53,176
你干了什么
What did you do?

1780
02:14:53,345 --> 02:14:56,345
我把高谭的光明骑士
I took gotham's white knight...

1781
02:14:56,514 --> 02:15:00,133
拉低到我们这个档次
...and I brought him down to our level.

1782
02:15:00,560 --> 02:15:03,514
并不难  看到了么  疯狂  如你所知
It wasn't hard. see, madness, as you know...

1783
02:15:03,688 --> 02:15:06,725
就像重力...
...is like gravity.

1784
02:15:06,900 --> 02:15:09,225
要做的只是轻轻一推
All it takes is a little push.

1785
02:15:26,169 --> 02:15:27,912
登特
Dent!

1786
02:15:48,900 --> 02:15:53,229
你的人交接之后  他们带她来了这儿  戈登  
This is where they brought her, gordon, after your men handed her over.

1787
02:15:53,989 --> 02:15:55,566
她就死在这里
This is where she died.

1788
02:15:55,740 --> 02:15:58,066
我知道  我当时在这儿...
I know, I was here...

1789
02:15:59,119 --> 02:16:01,870
-想救她的  -但你没有
...trying to save her. - but you didn't.

1790
02:16:02,163 --> 02:16:03,907
-我没办法  -不  你有办法
- I couldn't. - yes, you could've.

1791
02:16:04,082 --> 02:16:05,576
如果你听我的话
If you'd listened to me.

1792
02:16:05,750 --> 02:16:08,372
如果你直击腐败
If you stood up against corruption...

1793
02:16:08,545 --> 02:16:10,751
而不是和魔鬼交易
...instead of doing your deal with the devil.

1794
02:16:10,922 --> 02:16:12,547
我只是想抓住那些暴徒
I was trying to fight the mob!

1795
02:16:13,049 --> 02:16:17,877
知道我失去了什么后  你就不再敢给自己开脱了
You wouldn't dare try to justify yourself if you knew what I'd lost.

1796
02:16:19,180 --> 02:16:22,300
你有没有和你最爱的人说过
Have you ever had to talk to the person you loved most...

1797
02:16:22,475 --> 02:16:26,343
一切都会好的  即使你知道事实并非如此
...tell them it's gonna be all right, when you know it's not?

1798
02:16:28,023 --> 02:16:31,890
好了  现在你就能体会这种感觉了  戈登
Well, you're about to know what that feels like, gordon.

1799
02:16:32,652 --> 02:16:36,520
然后你就可以直视我的双眼  说你对不起
Then you can look me in the eye and tell me you're sorry.

1800
02:16:38,283 --> 02:16:41,866
-你不会伤害我的家人  -不
- you're not going to hurt my family. - no.

1801
02:16:42,037 --> 02:16:44,741
只是你的最爱
Just the person you love most.

1802
02:16:52,756 --> 02:16:55,792
是你的妻子么
So is it your wife?

1803
02:16:56,885 --> 02:16:58,545
把枪放下  哈维
Put the gun down, Harvey.

1804
02:16:58,928 --> 02:17:00,588
哈维  把枪放下
Harvey, put down the gun.

1805
02:17:00,764 --> 02:17:04,298
求你了  哈维  求你了
Please. please, Harvey. please.

1806
02:17:05,685 --> 02:17:06,966
哦 见鬼
Oh, goddamn it.

1807
02:17:07,145 --> 02:17:09,303
你能不能别再拿枪指着我的家人了
Will you stop pointing that gun at my family?

1808
02:17:09,814 --> 02:17:11,474
-不  -他入选了
No! - we have a winner.

1809
02:17:11,650 --> 02:17:13,144
不  吉姆 快阻止他
No, jim, stop him!

1810
02:17:13,652 --> 02:17:15,478
哈维  别杀他...
Harvey. don't let him...

1811
02:17:15,654 --> 02:17:16,768
哈维
Harvey!

1812
02:17:18,156 --> 02:17:20,030
我很抱歉
I'm sorry!

1813
02:17:21,826 --> 02:17:22,906
为所有事道歉
For everything.

1814
02:17:25,497 --> 02:17:27,703
求你别伤害我儿子
Please don't hurt my son.

1815
02:17:37,842 --> 02:17:39,420
你带警察来了?
You brought your cops?

1816
02:17:39,594 --> 02:17:42,465
他们只知道这里有情况
All they know is there's a situation.

1817
02:17:42,639 --> 02:17:45,640
不知道是什么人和什么事  只是封锁了现场
They don't know who or what. they're just creating a perimeter.

1818
02:17:45,809 --> 02:17:48,478
你以为我要逃么
You think I wanna escape from this?

1819
02:17:48,645 --> 02:17:51,397
我已经没有退路
There is no escape from this.

1820
02:17:51,564 --> 02:17:53,687
你不会伤害那个男孩的  哈维
You don't wanna hurt the boy, Harvey.

1821
02:17:55,986 --> 02:17:59,189
这不关我的意愿  这关于公平
It's not about what I want, it's about what's fair!

1822
02:17:59,948 --> 02:18:04,159
你以为我们在这个不公正的世界里可以做公正的人
You thought we could be decent men in an indecent time.

1823
02:18:06,955 --> 02:18:08,034
但你错了
But you were wrong.

1824
02:18:08,748 --> 02:18:12,532
世界是残酷的  唯一的道德准则就是
The world is cruel. and the only morality in a cruel world...

1825
02:18:13,295 --> 02:18:15,204
运气
...is chance.

1826
02:18:15,380 --> 02:18:17,088
没有偏颇
Unbiased.

1827
02:18:17,299 --> 02:18:18,544
没有成见
Unprejudiced.

1828
02:18:19,926 --> 02:18:21,041
绝对公平
Fair.

1829
02:18:21,219 --> 02:18:23,461
他的儿子和她有同样的机会
His son's got the same chance she had.

1830
02:18:24,222 --> 02:18:25,503
一半一半
Fifty-fifty.

1831
02:18:25,682 --> 02:18:29,133
瑞秋的死不是因为运气  我们决定行动的
What happened to rachel wasn't chance. we decided to act.

1832
02:18:29,477 --> 02:18:30,806
我们三个一起
We three.

1833
02:18:30,979 --> 02:18:34,395
为什么偏偏是我一个人失去一切?
Then why was it me who was the only one who lost everything?

1834
02:18:36,901 --> 02:18:39,523
-不是的  -小丑选了我
- it wasn't. - the Joker chose me.

1835
02:18:39,696 --> 02:18:41,985
因为你是我们中最出色的
Because you were the best of us.

1836
02:18:42,157 --> 02:18:47,151
他想证明像你一样优秀的人
He wanted to prove that even someone as good as you...

1837
02:18:47,329 --> 02:18:49,072
也会堕落
...could fall.

1838
02:18:49,414 --> 02:18:50,694
那么他是对的
And he was right.

1839
02:18:50,874 --> 02:18:53,116
你是持枪之人  哈维
You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey.

1840
02:18:53,293 --> 02:18:56,329
把它指向该负责任的人
So point it at the people responsible.

1841
02:18:57,297 --> 02:18:59,124
很公平
Fair enough.

1842
02:19:02,469 --> 02:19:04,342
你先
You first.

1843
02:19:16,858 --> 02:19:18,518
轮到我了
My turn.

1844
02:19:25,450 --> 02:19:27,443
哈维  你是对的
Harvey, you're right.

1845
02:19:28,495 --> 02:19:31,116
瑞秋的死是我的错
Rachel's death was my fault.

1846
02:19:34,209 --> 02:19:36,664
求你别错罚到孩子身上
Please don't punish the boy.

1847
02:19:37,754 --> 02:19:40,957
-求你  罚我就行  -我正要
- please, punish me. - I'm about to.

1848
02:19:42,926 --> 02:19:44,883
告诉你儿子  他会没事的  戈登
Tell your boy he's gonna be all right, gordon.

1849
02:19:45,345 --> 02:19:46,969
向他说谎
Lie...

1850
02:19:47,472 --> 02:19:48,587
就像我对瑞秋说谎
...like I lied.

1851
02:19:52,352 --> 02:19:53,930
没事的  孩子
It's going to be all right, son.

1852
02:20:32,350 --> 02:20:35,185
爸爸  爸爸  他没事吧
Dad? daddy, is he okay?

1853
02:20:51,703 --> 02:20:53,861
-谢谢  -你没必要谢我
- thank you. - you don't have to thank me.

1854
02:20:54,497 --> 02:20:56,289
我当然得谢你
Yes, I do.

1855
02:21:00,545 --> 02:21:01,874
小丑赢了
The Joker won.

1856
02:21:04,299 --> 02:21:07,169
哈维的苦心经营，他为之奋斗的一切…
Harvey's prosecution, everything he fought for...

1857
02:21:07,719 --> 02:21:09,462
都付之东流
...undone.

1858
02:21:09,971 --> 02:21:12,331
你给我们的重振城市的机会
Whatever chance you gave us at fixing

1859
02:21:12,332 --> 02:21:14,882
也随着哈维的身败名裂而消失了
Our city dies with Harvey's reputation

1860
02:21:15,060 --> 02:21:16,222
我们把一切寄托在他身上
We bet it all on him.

1861
02:21:17,562 --> 02:21:20,433
小丑却把他拉下宝座，让他坠入深渊
The Joker took the best of us and tore him down.

1862
02:21:21,024 --> 02:21:22,435
人们会失去希望
People will lose hope.

1863
02:21:22,609 --> 02:21:24,352
他们不会的
They won't.

1864
02:21:26,863 --> 02:21:28,737
他们永远不会知道他做了什么
They must never know what he did.

1865
02:21:28,907 --> 02:21:30,734
五个人死了
Five dead.

1866
02:21:31,034 --> 02:21:32,314
两个是警察
Two of them cops.

1867
02:21:32,494 --> 02:21:34,949
- 你没法抹煞这件事…  - 不
- you can't sweep that... - no.

1868
02:21:39,751 --> 02:21:42,586
不能让小丑得逞
But the Joker cannot win.

1869
02:21:47,842 --> 02:21:51,046
高谭需要它真正的英雄
Gotham needs its true hero.

1870
02:21:57,435 --> 02:22:00,472
- 不  - 要么舍生取义 作为英雄而死…
- no. - you either die a hero...

1871
02:22:00,647 --> 02:22:05,108
要么苟活  坐等与恶人同流合污
...or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.

1872
02:22:05,276 --> 02:22:07,103
我可以这样做
I can do those things...

1873
02:22:07,529 --> 02:22:10,565
因为我不是个英雄  不像登特
...because I'm not a hero, not like Dent.

1874
02:22:13,576 --> 02:22:16,447
是我杀了那些人  我可以如此
I killed those people. that's what I can be.

1875
02:22:16,621 --> 02:22:18,530
不行 绝对不行 你不是
No, no, you can't. you're not.

1876
02:22:18,707 --> 02:22:21,280
高谭需要什么人  我就是什么
I'm whatever gotham needs me to be.

1877
02:22:22,961 --> 02:22:24,076
叫他们进来吧
Call it in.

1878
02:22:27,382 --> 02:22:29,125
一个英雄
A hero.

1879
02:22:29,301 --> 02:22:32,551
或许我们不配拥有  但我们确实需要
Not the hero we deserved, but the hero we needed.

1880
02:22:33,138 --> 02:22:35,676
就像一个骑士
Nothing less than a knight...

1881
02:22:36,224 --> 02:22:37,932
闪耀着光明
...shining.

1882
02:22:38,560 --> 02:22:40,184
他们会追捕你
They'll hunt you.

1883
02:22:40,353 --> 02:22:42,145
你也要追捕我
You'll hunt me.

1884
02:22:42,647 --> 02:22:44,604
还要声讨我
You'll condemn me.

1885
02:22:45,317 --> 02:22:47,605
在我身后放狗追逐
Set the dogs on me.

1886
02:22:51,364 --> 02:22:53,653
因为事情必须如此
Because that's what needs to happen.

1887
02:22:54,826 --> 02:22:56,735
因为有时
Because sometimes...

1888
02:22:56,911 --> 02:22:59,070
真相并不一定美好
... the truth isn't good enough.

1889
02:22:59,956 --> 02:23:02,245
有时人们应该得到更多
Sometimes people deserve more.

1890
02:23:05,712 --> 02:23:09,626
有些时候 人们的信念必须得到回报
Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded.

1891
02:23:28,026 --> 02:23:29,686
蝙蝠侠
Batman.

1892
02:23:31,613 --> 02:23:33,356
蝙蝠侠
Batman!

1893
02:23:34,157 --> 02:23:36,114
爸爸  他为什么要跑？
Why's he running, dad?

1894
02:23:37,160 --> 02:23:38,488
因为我们得抓他
Because we have to chase him.

1895
02:23:38,662 --> 02:23:41,532
好 大家进去！快！
Okay, we're going in! go, go! move!

1896
02:23:47,629 --> 02:23:49,206
可他并没做错什么
He didn't do anything wrong.

1897
02:23:51,967 --> 02:23:57,553
因为高谭需要他这样的英雄  但还不是现在
Because he's the hero gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now.

1898
02:23:58,974 --> 02:24:00,005
所以我们要追捕他
So we'll hunt him...

1899
02:24:03,144 --> 02:24:05,220
因为他能承受这一切
... because he can take it.

1900
02:24:07,732 --> 02:24:10,223
因为他不是我们心目中的英雄
Because he's not our hero.

1901
02:24:17,784 --> 02:24:18,982
他是静默的守望者
He's a silent guardian...

1902
02:24:20,161 --> 02:24:22,035
时刻警惕的卫士
...a watchful protector.

1903
02:24:24,541 --> 02:24:25,821
暗夜中的骑士
A dark knight.
