米勒的犯規 ， 再次 ！

不它不是!

412
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:41,140
如果你們兩個不能打沒有爭吵 ， 希望你在所有。
If you two cant play without squabbling, wish you wouldn't play at all.

413
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,320
看看誰是我們的裁判。
Look who our referee is.

414
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,320
下午好。 我看。 很高興認識你。

420
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,630
布朗溫不有一個弟弟 ？
Didn't Bronwyn have a brother?

421
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,330
是的 ， 維克多的樓上。
Yes, Victor's upstairs.

422
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,740
等待 ， 以諾和橄欖 ？
Wait, where did Enoch and Olive go?

423
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,100
天知道。
Heaven knows.

424
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:16,570
以諾已有自從我們去尋找傑克。
Enoch's been off ever since we went to look for Jake.

425
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,580
Ms. Peregrine 那兒有個警察在門口。

427

我們稍後討論這個問題 ， 艾瑪。

428
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,060
這不是他們的錯。
It wasn't their fault.

429
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,700
老實說 ， 他們只是想幫我的。
Honestly, just they were just trying to help.

430
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,200
感謝。 你不像我想像中的獸醫。
Thanks. You're not as vet as I thought.

431
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,500
她還沒有真的去殺人 ， 是嗎 ？
She's not really going to kill anyone, is she?

432
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,970
如果她不可以說話。
Not if she can talk her way out of it.

433
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,810
你能幫我做些事。
Would you help me with something.

434
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,360
通常這種以諾 ， 但是正如我說的 ， 他一個勁地鬧彆扭。
Enoch usually does it but, like I said, he is sulking somewhere.

435
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,920
因為那是我的嗎 ？
Is that because of me?

436
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,460
他的佔有慾。
He is possessive.

437
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,530
. 所以.. 你需要幫助嗎 ？

441
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:21,470
天天 ？
That happens every day?

442
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,500
事故發生。
Like clockwork.

443
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:27,100
現在 ， 你能不能把繩子捆在腰間 ？
Now, would you mind tying that rope around my waist?

444
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,710

右。 承諾一定要掌握好嗎?

我知道 ， 我們搞砸了。

這曾經是他的工作

449
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,900
愛瑪 ， 我得告訴你一些事情。

450
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:00,340
他死了。
He is dead.

451
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:04,820
我知道。 Ms. Peregrine 猜 ， 她總是正確的。
I know. Ms. Peregrine guessed and she's always right.

452
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,620
It's okay
It 's Okay

453
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:11,150
我說再見了。
I said goodbye to him a long time ago.

454
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,870
你們關係密切嗎 ？
Were you close?

455
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,040
我是這樣認為的。
I thought we were.

456
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,440
一會兒。
For a while.

457
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:22,110
但我想沒有。
But I suppose not.

458
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:27,490
我可以問一下你喜歡他嗎 ？
Can I ask, was he like you?

459
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,600
他喜歡你。 傑克。
He was like you. Jake.

460
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,970
我要改變吃晚飯。

461
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,880
你會吃飯嗎 ？

462
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,580
我不能在外面呆得很晚。

晚餐下午 5: 30 。

464

這很好。
Well that's pretty early.

465
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:49,050
我們的目標是 8 年 ， 並不是所有的老人 ， 似乎連女士游。
The fact we are not all eight years of old's seems to have eluded Ms. Peregrine.

466
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:53,470
安倍的可以借你的衣服。 他的房間在閣樓上
You can borrow some of Abe's clothes. His room's in the attic

467
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:05,460
傑克。
Jake.

468
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:08,260
來見見 ， 以諾。

469
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:21,120
好吧 ， 你一定感到很不自在。

470
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:25,120
別擔心。 我已經習慣了。
Don't worry. I am used to it.

471
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:28,240
我並不擔心。 儘管一些建議給你。
I wasn't worried. Some advice for you though.

472
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,140
人與人之間。
Man to man.

473
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,970
如果你覺得你住你喜歡只是因為艾瑪
If you think you're staying just because you like Emma,

474
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,440
不要打擾。
Don't bother.

475
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,520
你看到她罵過神來年前當她得到她的心都碎了。
You see she swore off romance years ago when she got her heart broken.

476
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:41,530
她不會改變主意。
And she's never gonna change her mind.

477
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,230
以諾 ， 我沒有。..
Enoch, I wasn't...

478
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,440
你在幹什麼 ？
What are you doing?

479
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,730
並不令人驚奇嗎 ？
Isn't he amazing?

480
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,660
你做了什麼 ？
What did you do?

481
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,430
這個嗎 ？
This?

482
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,150
傑克。 這甚至不是好玩的。
Jake. This is not even the fun part.

483
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,710
您想看看有趣的部分 ？
Do you want to see the fun part?

484
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,060
他們很像木偶。
They are like puppets.

485
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:00,100
我只是告訴他們做什麼。
Just do anything I tell them.

486
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,570
更有趣的人。
It is even more fun with people.

487
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,300
你應該已經看到了一些我曾擁有的史詩戰役。
You should have seen some of the epic battles I used to have.

488
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:07,880
在我父母的殯儀館。
At my parent's funeral parlour.

489
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:13,290
你需要一條領帶。
You need a necktie.

490
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,540
如此。 我爺爺什麼時候做呢 ？
So. What did my grandpa do when he was traveling?

491
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,910
訪問其它回路。
Visited other loops.

492
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,680
真的嗎 ？
Really?

493
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,420
要做什麼 ？
To do what?

494
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,160
傑克 ， 有一些問題我不能回答 ， 好嗎 ？
Jake, there are some questions I can't answer, alright?

495
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,500
這樣就會輕鬆多了 ： 「我只要求他們停止。
So it will be a lot easier for me if you just stopped asking them.

496
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,910
嘿 ， 你在幹什麼 ？
Hey, what are you doing?

497
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,540
米勒 ， 去穿上衣服。
Miller, go and put some clothes on.

498
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,380
人不禮貌的裸體 ！
Polite persons do not take the sup in the nude!

499
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,620
好吧 ！
Alright!

500
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,800
你可以坐在這裡 ， 傑克。
You can sit here Jake.

501
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,270
看看以諾。 他的嫉妒。
Look at Enoch. He's jealous.

502
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:18,510
為什麼我會是嫉妒嗎 ？
Why would I be jealous?

503
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,750
你們可以去嫁給傑克 ， 我才不在乎呢。
All of you can go marry Jake for all I care.

504
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,490
不要被平均 ， 以諾。 她不想要。
Do not be mean, Enoch. She doesn't want to.

505
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,230
她就興奮的遊客。
She's just excited to have a visitor.

506
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:27,350
不嫁給任何人。

507
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,070
現在吃你的食物。
Now eat up your food before it gets cold.

508

休。
Hugh.

00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:38,540
你呢 ？
Where's your net?

510
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,330
它來了你的傑克。
It must be very strange for you Jake.

511
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:55,810
滿足你爺爺的朋友。

512

訪問另一個世紀。

513

喜歡的書籍 Flash Gordon?

現在 ！ 現在 ！ 橄欖 ， 我說過的問題。

我們不在這裡討論的未來。
We don't discuss the future here.

517
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:10,070
我們喜歡住在這裡和現在

518
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:14,470
克萊爾 ， 你為什麼不吃呢 ？
Claire, why aren't you eating?

519
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,640
她不好意思在傑克面前。
She's embarrassed in front of Jake.

520
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,520
不要 ， 請。

521
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,620
所以 ， 傑克 ， 你有什麼特點 ？

And that my friends is why he'll not be staying with us.

不管我們如何努力去說服他。

525
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:50,140
我們談到這 ， 傑克只是參觀。
We've spoken about this, Jake is just visiting.

526
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:53,210
你不會嗎 ， 傑克 ？
Do you not want to stay, Jake?

527
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,910
今晚。。

永遠。 你應該永遠留下來。

529
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,960
他為什麼要有呢 ？
Why would he if he doesn't have to?

530
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:03,800
他可以住在那兒。 長大了 ， 有一個很好的時間。
He can live out there. Grow older and have a good time instead.

531
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,830
然後離開。 就像他的祖父。
And leave. Just like his grandfather did.

532

艾瑪 ！

00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:15,190
請問 ， 到哪裡去 ？
Excuse me, where she's going?

534
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:16,890
那不是很好 ， 伊諾克 ！
That wasn't nice, Enoch!

535
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:18,990
你很明白安倍為什麼離開了我們。
You know perfectly well why Abe left us.

536
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,530
加入軍隊。
To join the army.

537
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,510
然後他遇見。 並有漂亮的婚禮蛋糕。

和一個可愛的小嬰兒。

539
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:27,070
孩子們 ！
Children!

00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,180
我知道你們都會喜歡的新朋友。
I know you'd all like a new friend.

541
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:33,420
但我相信傑克 ， 他自己在佛羅里達州。
But I'm sure Jake has plenty of his own back in Florida.

542
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:40,530
我想你應該準備好所有的電影 ， 我無法回答。
I think you should all get ready for movie-time while I answer that.

543
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:43,970
但你總是讓我們入住。
But you always let us stay for it.

544
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,110
Hi 。 這就是安倍。
Hi. This is Abe.

545
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:07,010
大家都怎麼樣 ？
How is everyone?

546
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:14,590
你有多餘的棉花糖 ， 傑克。
Yours has extra marshmallows, Jake.

547
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,130
米勒 ， 穿上睡衣。
Miller, put some pajamas on.

548
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,730
這是非常熱在這裡。
It is very hot in here.

549
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:21,540
停止抱怨。 打擾一下。
Stop moaning. Excuse me.

550
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:31,920
我爺爺告訴我這件事。
My grandpa told me about this.

551
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,330
Horace 項目自己的夢想 ， 對嗎 ？
Horace projects his dreams, right?

552
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:36,440
他聽收音機。
He used to listen to the radio.

553
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,510
當你變得乏味的知道每個單詞都背下來。
Gets tedious when you know every word off by heart.

554
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,680
精彩 ， 我買了。
Splendid, I'll take it.

555
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:46,790
這聽起來比衣服居多。
It sounds about clothes mostly.

556
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,830
很高興認識你。
Delighted to meet you.

557
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:51,630
超級襯衣。
Super shirt by the way.

558
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,930
當他做這種夢呢 ？
When did he dream this?

559
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,400
昨晚。
Last night.

560
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:59,510
他的一些預言性的夢。
Some of his dreams are prophetic.

561
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,520
但多數情況下他們的衣服。
But mostly they are about clothes.

562
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,450
在預言一樣 ， 他能看到未來 ？
Prophetic as in, he can see into the future?

563
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:24,120
在 ymbryne 。 她是誰 ？ 夫人游 ， 你認識她嗎 ？
The Ymbryne. Who is she? Mrs. Peregrine, you know her?

564
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:27,660
不要犯傻。 霍勒斯是個噩夢。 一切都結束了
Don't be silly. Horace was just having a bad dream. Thats all.

565
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:04,590
這是完全足夠的。 謝謝你看。
Thats quite enough. Thank you Horace.

566
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:07,000
我想可能是走了。
I think probably get going.

567
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:11,600
你可以在那裡過夜。 如果你想。 而不是在黑暗中走路回家。
You could stay the night. If you wanted to. Rather than walk home in the dark.

568
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,810
但該島是非常安全的 ， 不是嗎 ？
But the island is very safe, isn't it?

569
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,480
當然
Of course

570
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:19,370
我是說是非常坎坷的路。 傑克可能跳閘。
I only meant the path is dreadfully bumpy. Jake could trip.

571
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:22,730
也許你可以給他最捷徑 ？
Perhaps you could show him the shortcuts?

572
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:25,450
他應該要避免。.. 。
Should he ever need to avoid... bumps.

573
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:29,510
你不留下來看球。 它真的是太壯觀了。
Wont you stay to see the restart. It is really quite spectacular.

574
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,230
那是什麼 ？
What was that?

575
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,250
這是我的電話。
It was my phone.

576
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:19,230
它已經死了我想現在的環。..
It's been dead the whole time in the loop I guess now...

577
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,120
你的電話嗎 ？
Your phone?

578
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:26,190
是啊 ， 我不喜歡 ， 你的電話嗎 ？ 你可以叫人。..
Yeah, I don't like it, a telephone? You can call people...

579
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:30,040
寫入和發送消息。
And send written messages.

580
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,760
右。 你會喜歡這個。 你可以拍攝照片。
Right. You'll love this. You can take a picture.

581
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:35,180
按。.. 。.. 。。
Press that... there... yeah.

582
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:37,540
看到了嗎 ？
See?

583
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,500
怎麼了 ？
Whats wrong?

584
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:54,180
它只是覺得好笑 ， 有一天你會越來越像安倍了。
Its just funny to think that one day you'll grow up like Abe did.

585
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,750
結婚有小孩一學就會。
Get married... have children.

586
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,850
孫子。
Grandchildren.

587
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:02,290
你甚至可以給他們看看這張照片。
You might even show them this photograph.

588
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,370
而我仍然在這裡。
And I'll still be here.

589
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:08,100
哇。你能.. 離開麼 ？
Wha... can you leave some day?

590
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:10,870
生活在現在 ， 如果你想嗎 ？
And live in the present if you wanted to?

591
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:16,810
沒有。 在幾分鐘時間和你的年會。
No. More than a few minutes in your time and the years would catch up.

592
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:19,530
你的年齡嗎 ？
You'd age?

593
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:21,330
會的你一學就會。..
Would... you're...

594
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:29,470
我認為它是來自 ymbryne 賀拉斯的夢想。
I think it is the Ymbryne from Horace's dream.

595
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:32,550
你確定它不只是鳥類?
Are you sure it's not just a bird?

596
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,700
我不知道.. 這不是改變嗎 ？
I mean, I don't know... wouldn't it change?

597
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:37,690
她不能。 如果她不受傷害。
She can't. Not if she's hurt.

598
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:41,490
我得把她救出來。 你應該去。
I need to take her inside. You should go.

599
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,140
請不要說別的。 我討厭道別
Please do not say anything else. I hate goodbyes

600
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,840
我明天再來。
I'll come back tomorrow.

601
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:55,830
不用急。 我會永遠在這裡。
There's no hurry. I'll be here forever.

602
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,130
嘿。

603
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:08,280
我被這該死的島上所有你到底去哪了 ？
Have I been all this damn island Where the hell were you?

604
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,750
我只是在回來的路上。
I was just on my way back.

605
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,150
對不起 ， 我忘了時間。
Sorry, I lost track of time.

606
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,020
我的比賽有蠕蟲。..
I was having a blast with Worm...

607
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,760
D 和髒嗎 ？

你知道嗎 ？ 這是.. 這是好的。

這就是健康。 這是你真正的朋友。

十幾歲做的事情。

612
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:30,790
我想這都是正常的。 我敢肯定 ， 醫生將戈蘭批准。
I think this is normal. I am sure that Dr. Golan will approve.

613
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:32,130

Listen Sir, I don't know what happened here but my son and his friends.

621

已經在一起。 和傑克絕不會做這種事。
Have been together all day. And Jake would never do anything like this.

622
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:57,770
胡說八道! 我們沒看到他!
Bollocks! We haven't seen him!

623
00:53:58,070 --> 00:54:01,570
你昨天付了我們。 為什麼我們今天跟他出去呢 ？
You paid us yesterday. Why would we hang out with him today for free?

624
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,310
傑克你在場?
Jake were you with them or not?

625

不 ！ 我很抱歉 ！

你真的認為我能這麼做嗎 ？
And you don't seriously think I could do this?

627
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,000
我想我們在這裡完成 ， 先生。

嗯 ， 能傳遞我的消息嗎 ？
Well, can pass on a message for me?

你能告訴戈蘭 ， 若不是她鼓勵這個可笑的旅行
Can you tell Dr. Golan that if she hadn't encouraged this cockamamie trip

630
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:27,550
也許我兒子不會拖地都待在一處廢棄的房子
maybe my son wouldn't be mopping around all day in a derelict house

631
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:29,170

對不起 ， 我撒謊了。

Who is ready to hit the beach?

652

Jake, you're back. How wonderful!

679
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,220
如何做 ？
How's it doing?

680
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:50,500
愛瑪說 ， 這是一種 ymbryne 。
Emma said it was an Ymbryne.

681
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:54,010
她 ， 不是 「它」 。 ymbrynes 總是女性。
She, not 'it'. Ymbrynes are always female.

682
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:57,080
與艾瑪是很正確的。 這是反嘴鷸。
And Emma was quite correct. This is Ms. Avocet.

683
00:58:57,510 --> 00:59:00,610
她在英國的布萊克普爾環路。
Her loop is in Black Pool England.

684
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:05,160
那是一封私人信件 ， 傑克。
That was a private letter, Jake.

685
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:10,330
巴倫先生是誰 ？
Who is Mr Barron?

686
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:15,410
Ms. 游 ， 如果我爺爺有危險的人
Ms. Peregrine, if my grandpa was involved with dangerous people

687
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:18,120
我需要告訴警察。
I need to tell the police.

688
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:20,250
警察嗎 ？
To the police?

689
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:23,590
你是在暗示安倍非正常死亡 ？
Are you implying Abe died an unnatural death?

690
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,900
我發現他的眼睛在森林中失蹤。
I found him in the woods with eyes missing.

691
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:30,840
我可以說是相當不自然。
I'd say that was pretty unnatural.

692
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,410
除非必不可少。 我不討論令人不愉快的事。
Unless essential. I don't discuss unpleasant matters.

693
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,660
一個是 ymbryne 的責任保護孩子 ， 傑克。
An Ymbryne's is a duty to protect children, Jake.

694
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:43,330
我不是一個孩子。
I am not a child.

695
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,700
他想讓你告訴我一切。
He wanted you to tell me everything.

696
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:53,620
哦。 你有多麼沮喪。
Oh. How frustrating for you.

697
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:57,620
MS 之間。百利金融規則和 ******* 我不要嚇跑你。
Between Ms. Peregrine rules and my ******* not to scare you off.

698
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:00,220
這就像沒有人告訴你什麼了嗎 ？ ！
It's like no ones telling you anything?!

699
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:02,960
所以為什麼不呢 ？
So why don't you then?

700
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:05,140
你想要我留在這裡。
It's not like you want me here.

701
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,570
以諾 ， 你不能。
Enoch, you can't.

702
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,410
你答應。
You promised.

703
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:10,180
橄欖是正確的。
Olive is right.

704
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:13,550
然而 ， 我知道有人可以破壞規矩。
However, I know someone who can break the rules.

705
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:16,260
想見他嗎 ？
Want to meet him?

706
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:19,060
以諾 ， 不這樣做 ！ 請。
Enoch, do not do this! Please.

707
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:23,030
你不想讓我們花時間在一起。 你說的就是這個。
You didn't want us to spend time together. That's what you said.

708
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,340
好吧 ， 我們都在這裡。
Well, here we all are.

709
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,620
移動、橄欖。
Move, Olive.

710
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:33,690
如果你那我不想是你的朋友。
If you're going to be like then I do not want to be your friend.

711
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:40,060
以諾 ！ 離開。 bromwyn 總覺得很煩。
Enoch! Leave Victor alone. It really upsets Bromwyn.

712
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:43,670
別大驚小怪的 ， 菲奧娜。 你覺得傑克應該見過大家了嗎 ？
Stop fussing, Fiona. Don't you think Jake should meet everybody?

713
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:45,590
他要叫你走 ， 傑克。
He's trying to frighten you away, Jake.

714
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:48,010
他一直都很羨慕現在的安倍和他的嫉妒你。
He was always jealous of Abe and now he's jealous of you.

715
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:50,950
我們和他一起玩
Come and play with us instead

716
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,400
我很想認識維克多。
I'd quite like to meet Victor.

717
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,040
之後。
After You.

718
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,820
您好維克多。
Hello Victor.

719
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:19,240
我是傑克。 我很抱歉打擾。..
I'm Jake. I'm sorry to disturb...

720
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,780
他聽不到你。
He can't hear you.

721
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,530
你好 ， 傑克 ， 我是 Victor 。 你殺了我嗎 ？
Hello Jake, I'm Victor. Do you want to know what killed me?

722
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:02,360
啊 ， 你回來了。 他不是你的嗎 ？
Ah, there you are. Is he not with you?

723
01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:04,160
它為我們每天的散步時間。
Its time for our daily walk.

724
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:11,430
愛瑪 ， 誰殺了維克多 ？ 它是在人們的白眼 ？
Emma, Who killed Victor? Was it the people with the white eyes?

725
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:15,530
我問你不是要問問題。 我看見一個晚上我爺爺就去世了。
I asked you not to ask questions. I saw one the night my grandpa died.

726
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:21,840
如果這真的是一個 ， 你必須告訴女士 peregrinee 。
If it really was one, you have to tell Ms. Peregrinee.

727
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:24,450
你承認你認得出他的照片嗎 ？
Could you recognize you recognize him from a photograph?

728
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:25,650
你有嗎 ？
Do you have one?

729
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:29,050
那就來吧。 有我的地方去。
Then come on. There's somewhere I go to be alone.

730
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:30,480
我有東西存在。
I have things there.

731
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:11,470
- 是這個嗎 ？ 」 - 沒有。 這就是我們如何到達那裡。
- Is this the place? - No. This is how we get there.

732
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:34,750
艾瑪 ！ 你的鞋 ！ 鉛鞋 ！
Emma! Your shoes! Lead shoes!

733
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:41,740
- 歡迎到我的藏身之處。 - 怎麼 ？ 你。..
- Welcome to my secret hideout. - How? How did you...

734
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:48,130
空氣。 我的特點。 我想要它做什麼
Air. My peculiarity. It does what I want

735
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:12,710
傑克。 你爺爺退休前 ， 他問我要保持這個安全。
Jake. Before your grandfather retired, he asked me to keep this safe.

736
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:34,300
這是我爺爺的老地圖。 這表示你的循環。
This is my grandpa's old map. It shows you where the loops are.

737
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:48,860
這就是他他是我見到的那個人。 他是誰 ？
That's him, thats the man I saw. Who is he?

738
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:51,880
那是巴隆。 他是頭目。
Thats Barron. He is the Leader.

739
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:57,330
什麼的領袖 ？ 這些人是誰 ？
Leader of what? Who are these people?

740
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:00,460
奸人 peculiars 一學就壞。
Bad people... bad peculiars.

741
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:04,380
安倍為了抓捕他們。
Abe dedicated his life to hunting them down.

742
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:06,480
這些是他的身影。
These are the ones he never found.

743
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:09,840
你說什麼 「狩獵」 ？
What do you mean "hunting"?

744
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:17,560
他們搜查民宅。 整個家庭的孩子等死。
They raided homes. Whole homes full of children left for dead.

745
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:19,120
安倍會把生命。..
Abe took lives...

746
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,170
為挽救生命的。
To save life's.

747
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:23,470
他退休時只有你生來是為了保護你。
He only retired when you were born to protect you.

748
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,560
從什麼 ？
From what?

749
01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:32,170
如果我告訴你 ， 你得保證你不會亂跑。
If I tell you the rest, you have to promise not to run away.

750
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:36,070
傑克 ， 你屬於這裡。
Jake, you belong here.

751
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:40,580
你知道 ， 我不知道。 我不喜歡你。
You know that I don't. I'm not like you.

752
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:42,660
我只是普通。
I'm just ordinary.

753
01:07:42,670 --> 01:07:44,150
不 ， 但你不是。
No, but you're not.

754
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:48,210
傑克 ， 只有一個能進入一個奇特的循環時間。
Jake, only a peculiar can enter a time loop.

755
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:53,080
不 ， 那是不可能的。
No, that can't be right.

756
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:55,170
我的意思是。.. 我知道。
I mean... I would know.

757
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:56,230
細。
Fine.

758
01:07:57,150 --> 01:08:00,180
然後我就給你點別的東西。
Then I'll show you something else.

759
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:09,310
快點 ！ 你會錯過它。
Hurry! You'll miss it.

760
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:25,600
ymbrynes 約會的完美挑選產生環。
Ymbrynes usually pick the perfect date to create a loop.

761
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:28,830
但 peregrinee 。。要做到這一點。
But Ms. Peregrinee .. had to make this one in a rush.

762
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:30,990
為什麼呢 ？
Why?

763
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:34,440
因為德國隊準備在家裡。
Because the Germans were about to drop a bomb on the house.

764
01:08:34,450 --> 01:08:36,790
關鍵是 ， 在 9 月 3 日 ， 1943 年。。。
The point is, September the 3rd, 1943...

765
01:08:36,790 --> 01:08:38,280
它並非完美無暇。
wasn't perfect.

766
01:08:38,290 --> 01:08:42,250
維克多殺了回來。
The thing that killed Victor came back.

767
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:11,890
- 等一下 ， 當心 ！ - 噓 ， 那一切都完了。
- Wait, watch out! - Shhh, all bets are off.

768
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:42,280
你可以看到它 ， 不是嗎 ？
You can see it, can't you?

769
01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:43,570
沒有其他人可以。
No one else can.

770
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:48,260
看不見它 ， 傑克。 那是安倍最大的禮物。
Its invisible, Jake. That was Abe's greatest gift of all.

771
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:54,010
他看到了怪物。
He could see the monsters.

772
01:09:58,410 --> 01:10:02,920
我們稱之為 「hollowgasts」 。 空洞。 用於短。
We call them 'Hollowgasts'. Hollows. For short.

773
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:07,130
我爺爺告訴我 ， 他就變成了怪獸。
My grandpa told me about people, who turn into monsters.

774
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:08,830
那是什麼 ？
Is that what they are?

775
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:10,570
我將解釋一切 ， 傑克。
I will explain everything, Jake.

776
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:12,630
我害怕我的職責現在考慮。..
I fear its my duty now considering...

777
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:14,800
但你應該知道 ， 在這樣做。..
but you should know that in doing so...

778
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,940
我鄭重的許諾。
I'm breaking a solemn promise.

779
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:20,120
我知道你是奇特的出生
I knew you were peculiar when you were born

780
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:21,850
但你爺爺。..
but your grandfather...

781
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:23,590
禁止我什麼都告訴你。
forbid me to tell you anything.

782
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,990
他最大的願望是對你過正常的童年。
His dearest wish was for you to have an ordinary childhood.

783
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:28,820
好了 ， 我肯定。
Well I definitely had that.

784
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:32,540
他打算把真相告訴你 ， 當你年滿 18 歲。
He intended to tell you the truth when you turned 18.

785
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:37,930
他希望他的睡前故事鋪平了道路。
He hoped his bed-time stories would pave the way.

786
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:39,660
這是我的書。
Here's my book.

787
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:53,440
許多年前 ，
Many years ago,

788
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:57,050
當中出現了一個小派別。
a splinter faction emerged among our people.

789
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:59,950
不滿 peculiars 在環路。
Disaffected peculiars tired of living in loops.

790
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:02,300
這就是溫馨的。
That's Mr. Barron.

791
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:06,530
他認為 ， 通過治理的實質權力的 ymbryne ，
He believed that by harnessing the essence of an Ymbryne's powers,

792
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:07,700
他和他的親信。
he and his cronies.

793
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:12,470
能得到不朽和生活環外側。
Could gain immortality and be able to live outside loops.

794
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,620
他設計了一個實驗。
He devised an experiment.

795
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,680
他綁架了一名 ymbryne
He kidnapped an Ymbryne

796
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:22,640
不知道或關心自己能否生存的實驗。
not knowing or caring whether she would survive the experiment.

797
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:48,140
但在命運的巴倫和他的團隊仍然是令人震驚。
But the fate of Barron and his group was more horrifying still.

798
01:12:24,610 --> 01:12:27,210
為什麼沒有變成一個巴倫 ？
Why didn't Barron turn into one?

799
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:47,150
他做到了。 但幾年後他找到了一條反向的影響。.. 恢復人性。
He did. But years later he found a way to reverse the effects... to regain humanity.

800
01:12:47,490 --> 01:12:51,480
他們不是神仙 ， 但空洞。
They had become not immortal gods - but Hollows.

801
01:12:51,490 --> 01:12:55,490
隱形怪物 ， 危險 ， 冷酷 ， 致命 ！
Invisible beasts, dangerous, cold-blooded, deadly!

802
01:12:55,800 --> 01:13:00,140
記得我告訴你 ， 他們突擊搜查圈 ？ 這就是為什麼。
Remember I told you they raided loops? This is why.

803
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:04,410
Barron 等發現 ， 通過使用眼睛的其他 peculiars 。..
Barron discovered that by consuming the eyes of other peculiars...

804
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:06,030
尤其是兒童 ，
especially children,

805
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:16,200
他開始改變。
He began to change.

806
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:37,440
消耗足夠 ， 中空和可以形成全面恢復其人。
Consume enough, and a hollow can fully regain its human form.

807
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:42,010
正如巴倫和他的一些朋友。
Just as Barron and some of his friends did.

808
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:54,550
其餘的為凹部。
The rest of them are stuck as Hollows.

809
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:58,440
你是說我叔叔吃 Barron 's...
Are you saying that Barron ate my uncle's...

810
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:00,680
他不需要更多的眼睛 ，
He needs no more eyes himself,

811
01:14:00,690 --> 01:14:04,570
但我擔心他對你爺爺的 ， 是的。
but I fear he led a Hollow to your grandfather, yes.

812
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,400
在攻擊後的第一循環 ，
After the first attacks on Loops,

813
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:12,170
我們都更善於隱藏痛苦。 ..making 新環路。保持我們一學就會。
we all got better at hiding ...making new loops... keeping our.

814
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:13,320
行蹤神秘。
Whereabouts secret.

815
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:16,420
在絕望中更加不顧死活了每年空洞
The Hollows grew more desperate every year

816
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:19,280
Barron 和他的朋友希望能幫忙。
and Barron wishes to help his friends.

817
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:23,420
游小姐 ！ 快來 ！ 反嘴鷸小姐的清醒。
Miss Peregrine! Come quickly! Miss Avocet's awake.

818
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:32,600
游小姐哦 ！ 他們發現我的新循環。
Oh Miss Peregrine! They found my new loop.

819
01:14:32,610 --> 01:14:36,480
孩子們。.. 我想救他們 ， 但那孩子有許多空洞。..
The children... I tried to save them but there were so many Hollows...

820
01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:43,290
- 我不知道我如何逃脫。 - 你現在安全了。
- I don't know how I escaped. - You are safe now.

821
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:44,780
沒有人是安全的。
None of us are safe.

822
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:47,170
他們在我的機器循環。
They set up the machine in my loop.

823
01:14:47,330 --> 01:14:49,630
他們在地下室 blackboat 塔。
They put in in the cellar at Blackboat tower.

824
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,640
- 他們還在那裡.. - 這機器, 好嗎?
- They're still there... - The machine?

825
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:54,870
該實驗。 他們打算做一次 ！
The experiment. They intend to do it again!

826
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:57,520
這一次 ， 他利用 ymbrynes 更多。
This time, he's using more Ymbrynes.

827
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,890
他還想成為神仙。
He still wants to be immortal.

828
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:05,530
做只攻擊 peculiars 空洞 ？
Do Hollows only attack peculiars?

829
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:08,260
當然不是 ！ 他們是怪獸了, 傑克.
Of course not! They're monsters, Jake,

830
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:11,190
他們要殺他們。
they'll slaughter anything in their path.

831
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:14,110
一些綿羊在島上被殺 ，
Well, some sheep on the island were killed,

832
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:16,770
你不認為他們已經到了 ， 你呢 ？
You don't think they're here already, do you?

833
01:15:17,090 --> 01:15:20,890
你看見誰的眼睛 ？
Have you seen anyone with white eyes?

834
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,600
我很抱歉 ， 我們不能留在這裡。
I'm sorry children, we can't remain here.

835
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:26,740
什麼 ？
What?

836
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:29,240
我們離開了渡船 ， 離開島嶼的明天。
We leave on the first ferry, off the island tomorrow.

837
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:30,650
任何包裝的重要性。
Pack anything of importance.

838
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:32,810
我做三明治你走向床。
I'll make sandwiches and lead you to bed.

839
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:35,520
我們回來了嗎 ？ 我們什麼時候回來 ？
Are we leaving for good? When are we coming back?

840
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,360
從來沒有。 如果不在這裡游到重置循環。..
Never. If Ms. Peregrine's not here to reset the loop tomorrow night...

841
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:41,270
- 在房子被炸毀。 - 什麼 ？ 我們的房子 ？
- the house gets bombed. - What? Our house?

842
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:44,390
不要哭泣 ， 你會發現 Miss Peregrine 另一個可愛的家。.. 。
Don't cry, Miss Peregrine will find you another lovely house... somewhere else.

843
01:15:52,290 --> 01:15:56,320
一旦該回路關閉 ， 這就是它 ！ 我不能回到我自己的時間。
Once this loop closes, that's it! I can't get back to my own time.

844
01:15:56,330 --> 01:15:58,930
你看起來不是很開心。
You didn't seem very happy there.

845
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:01,760
我不能就這麼走了 ！ 我有一個家庭。
I can't just leave! I have a family.

846
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:05,810
你覺得和普通。 你想做任何改變。
And you felt ordinary. Like nothing you do changes anything.

847
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:09,770
現在你有機會改變這一切。
And, now you have a chance to do something that changes everything.

848
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:11,780
傑克 ， 甚是危險。..
Jake, were in danger...

849
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:15,220
而你是唯一一個誰可以看到洞穴。
and you're the only one who can see the Hollows.

850
01:16:15,230 --> 01:16:18,530
是啊 ， 但是我看到他們 ， 我不是我爺爺。
Yeah, I see them sure but, I'm not my grandpa.

851
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:19,800
我不是和我。 ..i
I'm not and I...I

852
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:22,940
不行 ， 我不能殺人。..
can't fight, I can't kill somebody...

853
01:16:26,490 --> 01:16:30,680
只有一個原因 ， 我還會住在這裡。
There's only one reason that I'd stay here.

854
01:16:30,690 --> 01:16:32,500
請。只要一學就會。

855
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:04,530
傑克。.. 傑克 ， 你來了 ！ 感謝神 ！
Jake... Jake, here you are! Thank God!

856
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:07,900
當我聽說他們找到了一具屍體 ， 我嚇了一跳。
When I heard they found a body, I freaked.

857
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:36,400
- 有流浪狗 ？ - 你說什麼呢 ？
- Are there stray dogs around here? - What are you talking about?

858
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:37,740
它像 ，
Its like,

859
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:43,050
當他們發現一隻受傷的動物 ， 他們喜歡的柔軟部分。
when they find an injured animal, they go for the soft parts first.

860
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:46,030
同樣的事情發生在我父親。
Same thing happened to my father.

861
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:48,570
警察已經在路上了。
The police are on their way.

862
01:17:50,030 --> 01:17:51,230
爸爸 ， 我得走了 ？
Dad, I gotta go?

863
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:52,810
沒有。你不要傑克.. 。
No... you don't Jake.

864
01:17:52,830 --> 01:17:55,210
如果這不是意外。..
If this wasn't an accident...

865
01:17:55,210 --> 01:17:57,270
有一個瘋子。
there's a lunatic on the island.

866
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:01,980
我知道大家都在這個島上 ， 除了你和我的整個生活。..
I've known everyone on this island, my whole life except you and him...

867
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:04,090
和他在一整個下午。
And he's been in the pub all afternoon.

868
01:18:04,110 --> 01:18:05,630
我也。.. 我正在睡覺。
So have I... I was sleeping.

869
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:07,890
什麼是瞎子 ？ 」 我的意思是。..
What about the blind fellow? I mean...

870
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:11,280
我以為他是盲人。 墨鏡紳士。
I assumed he was blind. The gentleman with the dark glasses.

871
01:18:11,290 --> 01:18:13,100
在渡船到達相同水平。
Arrived on the same ferry as me.

872

- 我看到他。 - 傑克 ！ 傑克 ！

- I can't... - Let me, I run 5 K's all the time.

875
01:18:51,070 --> 01:18:52,340
你好 ！
Hello!

876
01:18:56,820 --> 01:19:00,350
你好 ！ 是你嗎 ， 年輕人 ？
Hello! Is that you, young man?

877

879
01:19:10,470 --> 01:19:14,690
它很難。找到回路.. 。
It's terribly hard... to find loops these days.

880
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:19,570
所以你跟著我從海灘上 ？
So you followed me from the beach on purpose?

881
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:23,930
哦 ， 不。 我一直在關注你的遠不止這些 ！
Oh no. I've been following you much further than that!

882
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:30,650
Dr. 戈蘭 ？ ！
Dr. Golan?!

883
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:35,860
有時當我覺得合適。一學就會的
Sometimes when it suits me... the breadth of

884
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:41,620
我的特點是通過我的想像。
my peculiarity is purely limited by my imagination ..

885
01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:44,070
我唯一不能改變的。..
The only thing I can't change...

886
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:48,880
是我的眼睛。

887
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:57,460
拜倫先生 ， 你好嗎 ？

Ms. Peregrine's address from him, but alas...

890
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:13,620
我的旅伴我捷足先登了。..
my traveling companion got to him before I did...

891
01:20:15,230 --> 01:20:19,450
你們都知道 ， 沒有什麼能阻擋飢餓 hollowgasts 。
and as you know, there's no stopping a hungry Hollowgasts.

892
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:25,140

相信我當我告訴你

894
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:33,570
你不想來這裡。 當他到達。
you don't want to be here. When he arrives.

895
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:40,670
所以 ， 讓我們繼續走你的路就行了嗎 ？
So, lets be on your way... shall we?

896
01:20:57,710 --> 01:20:58,970
我不能忘記我們的日曆。
I mustn't forget our calendar.

897
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:01,390
你能幫它從客廳請 ， 小姐抓不緊 ， 反嘴鷸掉回水面 ？
Could you fetch it from the parlor please, Miss Avocet?

898
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:06,890
去幫助其他人。

899
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:25,520
小姐。 peregrinee 碰到你真高興 ， 終於到了 ！
Miss. Peregrinee what a pleasure to meet you, at last!

01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:27,040
我們可以進來嗎 ？
May we come in?

901
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:37,870
孩子 ， 你是否會讓你樓下了嗎 ？

902
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:40,980
我將在這個家裡 ， 他 ！

903
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:42,240
不是今天。
Not today.

904
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:45,760
你應該知道 ， 傑克已經為自己的目的。
You should know that Jake has served his purpose.

905
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:47,300
如果你珍惜他的生命
If you value his life

906
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:51,500
我建議每個人都會告訴他們的 ！ 孩子們 ！
I suggest everyone does as they are told! Children!

907
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:57,470
噓 ！ 沒有人告訴我的孩子要做什麼。
Shush! No one tells my children what to do.

908
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:00,430
孩子們來到這裡 ， 請。
Children come down here, please.

909
01:22:04,530 --> 01:22:07,300
Ms. Peregrine 。.. 我想我告訴過你要安靜 ！
Ms. Peregrine... I thought I told you to be quiet!

910
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:16,220
孩子們 ， 為了傑克的安全 ， 我們要做什麼 ， 博龍問道。
Children, for jake's safety, we are going to do what Mr. Barron asks.

911
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:19,120
他希望我和他一起到他在布萊克浦會合。
He wishes to take me with him to his rendezvous in Blackpool.

912
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:22,730
所以為了保護他 ， 他願意承擔我的鳥 ，
So for his protection, he would like me to assume bird-form,

913
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:24,690
優選籠狀。..
preferably caged...

914
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:28,250
他想和你開闢自己的可上鎖房間、客廳等。
And he'd like you to make your way into a lockable room, such as the parlor.

915
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:29,300
他不會釋放傑克
As he wont release Jake

916
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:32,790
如果他的攻擊可以被安裝在他一次 ， 他失去了槓桿作用。
if he fears an attack could be mounted upon him once he loses his leverage.

917
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:35,830
正確 ， 巴倫先生嗎 ？
Correct, Mr. Barron?

918
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:40,930
你犧牲自己 ， 和我們大家一學就會的傑克 ？
You are sacrificing yourself and all of us... for Jake?

919
01:22:40,930 --> 01:22:44,310
溫馨的祝福 ， 帶著一個中空 ， 以諾。
Mr. Barron travels with a Hollow, Enoch.

920
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:47,450
一旦到達這裡 ， 我們都死了。
Once it arrives here, we're all dead.

921
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:51,110
以諾 ， 傑克只是看看。
Enoch, only Jake can see them.

922
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,730
她是我們唯一的希望。
She means he's our only hope.

923
01:23:38,030 --> 01:23:43,400
我一直有這樣的特權 ， 關心你所有。
It's been my privilege, to care for you all.

924
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:46,040
再見 ！ 我的孩子。

925
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,100
現在 ， 讓他走。
Now, let him go.

926
01:24:20,370 --> 01:24:24,230
答應我一件事 ， 傑克。
Promise me one thing, Jake.

927
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:30,470
你會嘗試去照顧他們。
That you will try to look after them all.

928
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,400
我保證。
I Promise.

929
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,710
天快黑了。 你不會甚至能夠看到自己的影子。
Its getting dark. You won't even be able to see their shadows.

930
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:15,610
我們不得不呆在裡面。 我們唯一的機會。
We have to stay inside. Its the only place we stand a chance.

931
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:16,980
他很正確。
He's quite right.

932
01:25:16,990 --> 01:25:20,960
現在呢 ， 小姐。 百富勤把武器嗎 ？
Now where does Miss. Peregrine keep her weapon?

933
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:22,880
現在的孩子好了就行了。
Now... all right children.

934
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:25,840
確保所有的門都鎖上了 Windows 和鎖存。
Make sure all the doors are locked and the windows are latched.

935
01:25:25,850 --> 01:25:28,820
一切必須密封得很嚴實。 現在 ， 快 ， 快走。
Everything must be sealed up tight. Now quickly, quickly go.

936
01:25:44,630 --> 01:25:48,460
傑克 ， 我認為 ， 你今晚最好的答案。
Jake, I think tonight you better answer that.

937
01:25:53,510 --> 01:25:57,420
你好嗎 ？
Hello?

938
01:26:00,050 --> 01:26:03,140
你.. 你不認識我。 我是傑克。
You... you don't know me. I'm Jake.

939
01:26:03,150 --> 01:26:07,600
啊 ！ 你是新的。 歡迎來到傑克的家人。
Ah! You're new. Well, welcome to the family Jake.

940
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:08,980
我現在不能說話 ，
Now I can't talk long,

941
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:13,180
Peregrine 小姐 ， 只要告訴我在空軍基地 ， 我沒意見。
so just tell Miss Peregrine that I'm at the airbase, and I'm fine.

942
01:26:15,650 --> 01:26:19,230
我只想說 ， 我想念你
I just wanted to say that, I miss you

943
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:23,100
如果我讓你失望了 ， 對不起。..
and if I disappointed you, I'm sorry...

944
01:26:23,110 --> 01:26:26,970
而且你是爺爺。
and you're the best grandpa in the world.

945
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:53,720
- Fiona! - 找到了 ！
- Fiona! - Got it!

946
01:26:54,720 --> 01:27:00,090
小姐。 反嘴鷸 ！ 現在的孩子 ， 既然你們都在這裡 ， 有一些規則。
Miss. Avocet! Now children, now that you are all here, there's a few rules.

947
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:03,970
你的主要任務是保障自身安全。 離開中空。
Your primary job is to stay safe. Leave the Hollow to me.

948
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:06,180
我不想看到任何豪言壯語。
I don't want to see any heroics.

949
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:11,050
現在 ， 你的花園用工具 ， 我強烈建議你。..
Now, those of you with garden tools, I must insist that you...

950
01:27:34,330 --> 01:27:35,860
以諾沒有 ！ 回來 ！
No Enoch! Get back!

951
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:03,940
去 ！ 到了閣樓。
Go! Get to the attic.

952
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:08,120
抓住她 ！
Take her!

953
01:28:22,450 --> 01:28:25,950
去 ！ 去 ！ 出去 ！ 來吧所有。
Go! Go! Get out! All Come on.

954
01:28:42,990 --> 01:28:46,760
好吧。一學就會 ！ 它幾乎復位。
Alright... crap! Its almost reset.

955
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,200
菲奧娜 ， 你有什麼可以做的嗎 ？
Fiona, is there anything you can do with that tree?

956
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:55,340
小心 ！
Be careful!

957
01:28:58,950 --> 01:29:01,250
我們將通過窗口。 我們走吧 ！
We're going through the windows. Lets go!

958
01:29:25,890 --> 01:29:26,960
來吧 ！
Come on!

959
01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:38,720
克萊爾 ！ 下來吧。
Claire! Come on down.

960
01:30:12,650 --> 01:30:14,020
Fiona 去 ！
Go Fiona!

961
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:22,870
讓我們繼續前進 ！
Let's move on!

962
01:30:46,710 --> 01:30:51,380
- 那是什麼 ？ - 閉合環路。 它不見了。
- What was that? - The loop closing. It is gone.

963
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:15,880
我很抱歉 ， 傑克 ？ 我們現在怎麼辦 ？
I'm sorry Jake? What do we do now?

964
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:18,830
有無 Barron 。..
Is there any sign of Barron...

965
01:31:18,830 --> 01:31:24,210
- 小姐。 peregrinee ？ 《亂世佳人》。 Barron 必須有一條船。
- and Miss. Peregrinee? - Gone. Barron must have had a boat.

966
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:31,620
我們必須去追他們。 我們知道他要帶她去布萊克浦。
Well, we have to go after them. We know he is taking her to Blackpool.

967
01:31:31,630 --> 01:31:34,060
但布萊克浦英里遠 ， 並且下一個渡口
But Blackpool is miles away, and the next ferry

968
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:37,540
不走好幾個小時。。 我們永遠也不能成功。
doesn't go for hours.. We'll never make it in time.

969
01:31:37,540 --> 01:31:40,400
除非我們不是去坐船了 ！
Not unless we go by boat too!

970
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:30,640
所以這裡有一個回路中 ， 其只有六個月大。
So there's a loop here in Blackpool, its only six months old.

971
01:33:30,650 --> 01:33:33,740
1 月 11 日 ， 2016 年。 與小姐。 反嘴鷸了。..
January 11th, 2016. With Miss. Avocet gone...

972
01:33:33,740 --> 01:33:37,610
- 它不能被重置。 - 不會在環路閉合 ？
- It can't be reset. - Won't the loop closes?

973
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:40,400
然後 ， 實際時間。
Then its back to real time.

974
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:44,100
傑克 ， 你知道這意味著什麼 ， 不是嗎 ？
Jake, you know what this means, don't you?

975
01:33:44,110 --> 01:33:45,600
你將會死去。
You're going to die.

976
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,290
我不是這個意思。
Thats not what I mean.

977
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:50,960
我們要建立我們自己的時間。 但你不要。
We have to get to our own time. But you don't.

978
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:53,620
你可以繼續住 2016 年。
You can continue to live in 2016.

979
01:33:54,450 --> 01:33:55,990
但我為什麼要這麼做 ？
But why would I do that?

980
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,350
如果我們殺了拜倫 ， 他就會消失 ， 但時間會進行。
If we kill Barron, he'll be gone but time will carry on.

981
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:02,860
他不會去佛羅里達
He won't go to Florida,

982
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:06,770
安倍不會死 ， 你就可以回家了。
Abe won't die and you can go home.

983
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:11,380
我可以看到我爺爺。
I can see my grandpa.

984
01:34:16,490 --> 01:34:18,450
聽著 ！ 我可以解釋一切。
Listen! I can explain everything to them.

985
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:20,600
我可以說服他們把我送到該島。
I can persuade them to take me to the island.

986
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:28,010
你還在嗎 ？ 我們走了老循環。.. 。
Will you still there? Our old loop's gone... for good.

987
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:31,850
我們不會再相見。
We wouldn't see each other again.

988
01:34:31,860 --> 01:34:34,460
我以為你希望我留下
I thought you wanted me to stay

989
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:43,300
我知道你會選擇安倍。 如果我的我不會告訴你。
I know you'll choose Abe. If I minded I wouldn't have told you.

990
01:34:52,290 --> 01:34:55,830
因此 ， 我們發現小姐。 反嘴鷸的環路上的地圖嗎 ？
So, we found Miss. Avocet's loop on the map yet?

991
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:59,730
在這裡, 但其新 ， 她今年早些時候。
Its here, but its new, she made it earlier this year.

992
01:34:59,730 --> 01:35:00,650
我的一年。
Its my year.

993
01:35:00,670 --> 01:35:04,340
如果我們不離開之前關閉它 ， 我們就被困在 2016 年 1 月。
If we don't get out before it closes, we're stuck in January 2016.

994
01:35:04,350 --> 01:35:08,820
偉大 ！ 所以時間追上我們 ， 除非我們都死了你 ！
Great! So time catches up with all of us, we all die except you!

995
01:35:08,820 --> 01:35:10,470
計劃 ？ 在閉合回路 4 ： 30 。
Plan? Loop closes at 4:30.

996
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:14,520
我的意思是 ， 我們需要培養 ， 搶救 ymbrynes 。一學就會、退出。
I mean, we need to get in, rescue the Ymbrynes... and get out.

997
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:15,890
如果我們不是已經死了。
If we're not dead already.

998
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:20,100
小姐。 反嘴鷸說機器在該地下室黑池塔建築。
Miss. Avocet said the machine is in the cellar of the Blackpool tower building.

999
01:35:20,110 --> 01:35:22,780
這就意味著我們將室內帶有鏤空。
That means we'll be indoors with Hollows.

1000
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:26,920
第.. 我們不能 ！ 我有個計劃 ， 但我需要你的幫助。
No... we wont! I've got a plan, but I'm going to need your help.

1001
01:35:57,770 --> 01:36:01,840
- 這不可能啊 ， 是不是 ？ 閉環入口可位於任何地方。
- This can't be it, can it? - Loop entrances can be anywhere.

1002
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:04,250
一個在倫敦的地鐵隧道。
The one in london is in a subway tunnel.

1003
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:22,380
- 當然 ， 這是它嗎 ？ - 我也這麼想
- Sure, this is it? - I think so

1004
01:36:24,450 --> 01:36:28,040
米勒 ， 我有個事情需要你做第一。
Miller, there's something I need you to do first.

1005
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:29,280
好吧 ， 我知道。
Alright, I know.

1006
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:35,860
看 ！ 有的塔。 其不遠。
Look! There's the tower. Its not far.

1007
01:36:35,870 --> 01:36:38,750
你說的容易 ！ 我好冷。
Easy for you say! I'm freezing.

1008
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:45,630
準備好了嗎 ？
Ready?

1009
01:36:56,720 --> 01:37:01,450
所有的門都是鎖在地下室。 唯一的途徑是 ymbrines 。..
All the doors to the cellar are locked. The only way to reach the Ymbrines is...

1010
01:37:01,450 --> 01:37:05,090
- 那是後台。 - 你能看見多少個坑 ？
- Thats backstage. - How many Hollows can you see?

1011
01:37:05,690 --> 01:37:08,320
四個。 這是好消息。
Four. Its good news.

1012
01:37:08,330 --> 01:37:11,030
我想你和我不同定義的好新聞。
I think you and I have a very different definition of good news.

1013
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:14,110
這意味著 Barron 's 其他朋友還沒有來。..
It means Barron's other friends haven't arrived yet...

1014
01:37:14,110 --> 01:37:19,690
他們還沒有開始實驗。 我們不會太晚。
Means they haven't started the experiment. We're not too late.

1015
01:37:20,890 --> 01:37:24,510
OK ， 你準備好了嗎 ？ 你知道說什麼。
Ok Emma, you ready? You know what to say.

1016
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:25,520
嗨 ， 傑克。
Hey, Jake.

1017
01:37:28,230 --> 01:37:31,570
我們應該接受我們的採訪。
Our brethren should be joining us momentarily.

1018
01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:32,780
此為一天。..
This is a day...

1019
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:34,250
嘿 ！ 你在那裡。
Hey! You down there.

1020
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:37,170
我們殺死你的朋友拜倫先生
We killed your Hollow friend Mr. Barron

1021
01:37:37,180 --> 01:37:40,150
現在又來找小姐。 peregrinee 。
and now we've come for Miss. Peregrinee.

1022
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:43,440
她和所有其他 ymbrines 到碼頭的盡頭
Bring her and all the other Ymbrines to the end of the pier

1023
01:37:43,450 --> 01:37:46,670
在 5 分鐘或者.. 承擔後果。
in five minutes... or face the consequences.

1024
01:37:50,340 --> 01:37:54,030
這些孩子必須做校長的蠢事
These children must be as insane as their headmistress

1025
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:58,340
還有 ， 在空洞會很高興的。
Still... the Hollows will be glad of a feed.

1026
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:02,960
你在哪裡 ？
Where are you?

1027
01:38:02,970 --> 01:38:06,480
我知道你在這裡。
I know you're in here somewhere.

1028
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:11,160
啊.. 好了.. 聽我說。
Ah... good..., listen to me.

1029
01:38:11,170 --> 01:38:13,890
我要你跟阿切爾先生。..
I want you to follow Mr. Archer...

1030
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:15,220
和克拉克先生。
and Mr. Clark.

1031
01:38:15,230 --> 01:38:20,440
他們要把你拉到一個小碼頭的下午茶。
They are going to take you down to the pier for a little afternoon tea.

1032
01:38:21,670 --> 01:38:23,100
阿切爾先生 ， 克拉克先生 ，
Mr. Archer, Mr. Clark,

1033
01:38:23,110 --> 01:38:26,180
收集空穴 ， 並把他們帶到了碼頭。
gather the Hollows and take them to the pier.

1034
01:38:26,270 --> 01:38:27,560
那些遇難學生 malphus ？
Those children killed Malphus?

1035
01:38:27,570 --> 01:38:30,140
居次的是亞歷巴隆 … 巴隆的事 ， 因為他殺死了亞伯 malphus 波特曼。
Barron has had it for Malphus since he killed Abe Portman.

1036
01:38:30,150 --> 01:38:34,930
安倍波特曼就是好幾個月。
Thats Abe Portman for months.

1037
01:38:35,990 --> 01:38:37,660
我只需要幾分鐘
All I needed was a few minutes

1038
01:38:37,670 --> 01:38:40,830
為了得到該位置的小姐。 游隼的環路。
to get the location of Miss. Peregrine's loop from him.

1039
01:38:40,830 --> 01:38:42,400
但沒有。
But no.

1040
01:38:42,410 --> 01:38:46,070
malphus 迫不及待和代替
Malphus couldn't wait and instead

1041
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,650
我曾偽裝成
I had to masquerade as

1042
01:38:48,650 --> 01:38:56,650
精神科醫師的三個星期在佛羅里達州。 你去過佛羅里達嗎 ？
a psychiatrist for three weeks in Florida. Have you ever been to Florida?

1043
01:39:02,170 --> 01:39:04,530
我不是告訴過你的山谷嗎 ？
Did I not tell you to gather the Hollows?

1044
01:39:04,540 --> 01:39:05,710
如果這是個陷阱嗎 ？
What if it's a trap?

1045
01:39:05,710 --> 01:39:08,600
當然 ， 小姐。 愛德華茲 ！ 但是這又怎麼樣呢 ？
Of course it is Miss. Edwards! But what of it?

1046
01:39:08,620 --> 01:39:12,800
幾個孩子針對四個凹穴。 讓我們結束這一切。
A couple of children against four Hollows. Lets get this over with.

1047
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:33,530
傑克 ， 我 atuck ！
Jake, I'm atuck!

1048
01:39:39,870 --> 01:39:41,080
快點 ！
Hurry up!

1049
01:40:02,650 --> 01:40:03,850
他們來了 ！ 」
They are coming!

1050
01:40:27,830 --> 01:40:29,660
以諾 ！
Enoch now!

1051
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:49,700
現在走吧 ！
Go now!

1052
01:41:02,690 --> 01:41:04,330
可以看到現在。
Can be seen now.

1053
01:41:12,780 --> 01:41:13,850
艾瑪 ！ 去 ！
Emma! Go!

1054
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:19,650
不要只是站在那裡 ！ 抓住他們 ！
Don't just stand there! Get them!

1055
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:08,840
好吧 ， 好男人。 用於步驟 2 。
Alright, good job guys. Time for Step 2.

1056
01:43:08,850 --> 01:43:10,390
救人的女士游。
Save the Ms. Peregrine.

1057
01:43:10,390 --> 01:43:15,770
是的.. 3 步驟的排序。 先解決富賈。
That's... sort of step 3. First we've got to deal with Barron.

1058
01:43:18,270 --> 01:43:21,940
- 他們應該回來了。 - 我說這是個陷阱。
- They should've been back by now. - I said it was a trap.

1059
01:43:21,940 --> 01:43:26,920
如果真的是那樣 ， 也許我們現在應該移動 ymbrynes 。
If thats true, perhaps we should move the Ymbrynes now.

1060
