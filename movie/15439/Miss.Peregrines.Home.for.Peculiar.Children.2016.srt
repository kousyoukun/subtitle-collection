蓝光电影网

2
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,710
你是否曾觉得所做的一切都无济于事
Do you ever feel like nothing you do matters?

3
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,430
就像你在沙滩上留下了脚印
You leave footprints on the beach,

4
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,830
可第二天就会消失不见
and tomorrow they're gone.

5
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,710
日复一日过着平淡的生活
Like it's just today over again.

6
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,460
他们说青春年少的时光
They say your teen years

7
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,860
是用来广交朋友  纵情享乐的
are for making friends and having fun...

8
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,420
这让我感觉更难受了
which made me feel even worse.

9
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,270
艾米  我是杰克
Hey, Amy. It's Jake.

10
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,990
我们一起上数学课
I'm in your math class.

11
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,400
别忘了你的成人纸尿裤
Hey, don't forget your adult diapers.

12
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,480
是啊
Yeah, right.

13
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,790
杰克  有你的电话
Jake. Phone for you.

14
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,870
但那一天  一切都改变了
But that day, everything changed.

15
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,630
谢谢你送我  谢莉
Thanks for the ride, Shelley.

16
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,980
为什么要你去照顾你爷爷
So, how come you have to go deal with your grandpa?

17
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,550
我爸工作脱不开身
My dad couldn't get out of work.

18
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,790
我都不知道他居然有工作
I didn't think he worked.

19
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,110
我给爷爷打个电话
I'm just gonna call Grandpa.

20
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,030
你好  我是亚伯
Hello, this is Abe.

21
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,670
我是杰克
Hey, it's Jake.

22
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,070
不  不要过来  听我说
No! Don't come here. Listen to me.

23
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,910
这里不安全
It's not safe.

24
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,110
不要来这里
Stay away.

25
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,630
爷爷  你今天吃药了吗
Grandpa, did you take your pills today?

26
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,500
我枪柜的钥匙本来放在抽屉里
The key to my gun cabinet, it was in the drawer.

27
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,990
可是现在不见了
And now it's gone.

28
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,350
对啊  爸爸拿走了  记得吗
Yeah, Dad took it, all right?

29
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,630
他帮你保管着呢  没事的
For safekeeping. It's okay.

30
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,370
你爸要我赤手空拳对付他们吗
Your father wants I should fight them without a gun?

31
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,590
上帝保佑他
God bless him.

32
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,150
他怎么了  老年痴呆症吗
What's his deal, Alzheimer's?

33
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,990
障碍性痴呆症
Dementia.

34
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,950
那家伙真是吓死我了
That guy gave me the heebie-jeebies.

35
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,590
有事就叫我
Holler if you need me.

36
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,900
爷爷
Grandpa?

37
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,360
谢莉
Shelley!

38
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,280
怎么了
What's goin' on?

39
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,860
有人闯进去过
Someone broke in.

40
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,580
我车里有把38毫米口径的手枪  你在这儿等着
I've got a .38 in my car. You wait there.

41
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,700
爷爷
Grandpa!

42
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,290
911  请问您有什么紧急情况
911. What's your emergency?

43
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,510
911吗  我需要医护人员
911? Yeah, I need the paramedics.

44
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,980
地址是棕榈圈2040号  我爷爷...
It's at 2040 Palm Circle. My grandpa...

45
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,370
先生  请问您有什么紧急情况
Sir, what's your emergency?

46
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
爷爷
Grandpa.

47
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,470
你必须离开这里
You have to get away from here.

48
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,920
先生  能听见我说话吗
Sir, can you hear me?

49
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,790
快走  听我说
Please. Listen.

50
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,670
去岛上
Go to the island.

51
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,630
先生  医务人员已经出发了
Sir, paramedics are on their way.

52
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,910
找到埃莫森
Find Emerson.

53
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,830
那张明信片
The postcard.

54
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,510
去时光圈
Go to the loop.

55
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,390
1943年9月3号
September 3rd, 1943.

56
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,100
没事的
It's okay.

57
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,190
不要动  救护车马上就来了
Just don't move. There's an ambulance coming.

58
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,270
我知道你觉得我疯了
I know you think I'm crazy.

59
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,470
但那只鸟会向你解释清楚一切的
But the bird will explain everything.

60
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,710
你愿意去吗  泰利斯库  向我保证
Will you do this, Tygrysku? Promise me?

61
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,310
我保证
I promise, yes.

62
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,910
我以为我能保护你
I thought I could protect you.

63
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,150
几年前我就该告诉你
I should have told you years ago.

64
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,310
爷爷  告诉我什么
Grandpa. Tell me what?

65
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,900
爷爷
Grandpa!

66
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,070
谢莉  小心身后
Shelley, behind you!

67
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,190
那里根本没人
There was no one there.

68
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,950
容我说一句  杰克
May I say, Jake...

69
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,270
考虑到案发只过了一个月
that considering this was only a month ago...

70
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,900
你现在的状态已经非常好了
I think you're doing exceptionally well.

71
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,780
虽然我是个疯子
Apart from being crazy?

72
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,220
做噩梦和感到焦虑并不代表你是个疯子
Having nightmares and anxiety doesn't make you crazy.

73
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,910
那总是看到本不存在的事物呢
What about seeing things which aren't there?

74
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,170
其实  遭遇精神创伤后
Actually, in traumatic situations,

75
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,420
很容易出现这种情况
it's not at all uncommon.

76
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,190
你的潜意识会将电影中的画面或是...
Your subconscious mind drew an image from a movie or...

77
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,830
是故事
It was a story.

78
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,580
我小时候爷爷给我讲了很多故事
My grandpa told me stories when I was a kid...

79
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,470
关于他在战争中对抗过的那些怪物
about monsters that he fought in the war.

80
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
就是这样
So there you go.

81
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,510
他惨遭歹徒袭击
He was brutally attacked...

82
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,990
在你的脑海中  凶手毫无人性  是个怪物
and in your head, the man who did it was inhuman, a monster.

83
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,430
可他不是被人杀害的
It wasn't a man, though.

84
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,910
警察说是狗
The cops said that dogs

85
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,190
划破了纱门
scratched up the screen door...

86
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,310
他追它们追到了树林里
and he chased them off into the woods.

87
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,670
验尸官说他当时是心脏病突发
And the coroner said he had a heart attack.

88
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,830
警察说...
And the cops said...

89
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,870
狗吃了他的眼睛
that dogs go for the soft parts.

90
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,550
他们对那把叉子做了检测
They DNA tested the fork...

91
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,550
上面有动物DNA
and it had animal DNA.

92
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,990
案子就这么结了
So, that's case closed.

93
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,830
他似乎是一位很优秀的绅士
He sounds like an extraordinary gentleman.

94
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,270
你和他亲近吗
Were you very close?

95
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,920
波多黎各
Puerto Rico.

96
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280
这里
Here.

97
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,430
这里有一片湖  会在黑夜中发光
There's a lake where the water glows in the dark.

98
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,510
还有一个秘密隧道
And a secret tunnel.

99
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,980
我就是在那里躲避怪物的
That's where I hid from the monsters.

100
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,350
他以前经常照看我
He used to babysit me a lot.

101
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,790
和爷爷在一起时  我会觉得自己很特别
When I was with him, I felt special.

102
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,110
我的鸭肉火候又过了
My duck was dry again.

103
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,670
亚伯  都11点了  他怎么还没睡
Abe. It's, like, 11:00. What is he doing up?

104
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,630
我要做一个探险家
I'm gonna be an explorer.

105
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,630
爷爷在帮我计划我的首次出航
Grandpa's helping me plan my first voyage.

106
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,950
孩子  世界上的一切已经都被探索出来了
Everything's already been discovered, buddy.

107
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,250
它们威胁彼此
They terrorize each other...

108
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,950
然后肆意破坏了岛屿其他部分
before wreaking havoc on the rest of the island.

109
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,400
别听你爸的
Pay no attention to your father.

110
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,500
他啥都不懂
He knows bubkes.

111
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,030
来吧  泰利斯库  该去睡觉了
Come, Tygrysku. Off to bed.

112
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,550
它们从不挑食
And they're not choosy.

113
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,350
总是成群结队地撕碎食物
These talons come in squadrons.

114
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,710
触地得分  佛罗里达  太激动人心了
Touchdown, Florida! What a drive.

115
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,910
你能给我讲个故事吗
Can you tell me a story?

116
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
老规矩吗
The usual?

117
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,790
好  很久很久以前
Okay. Once upon a time...

118
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,230
有一个小男孩...
there was a little boy...

119
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,790
要带图片
With the pictures.

120
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,580
图片
Pictures.

121
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,030
很久很久以前
Once upon a time...

122
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,830
有一个叫亚伯的小男孩
there was a little boy called Abe.

123
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,310
就是你啊
That was you.

124
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,760
就是我
That was me.

125
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,150
他住在威尔士附近的一个小岛上
And he lived in a lovely children's home

126
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,870
住在一个温馨的儿童之家里
on a little island near Wales...

127
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,230
那里的阳光每天都很灿烂
where the sun shone every day.

128
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,190
那里的校长  佩格林小姐
The headmistress, Miss Peregrine...

129
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,230
非常聪明
was very clever.

130
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,860
她总是叼着烟斗
And she smoked a pipe.

131
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,180
她可以变成鸟
She could turn into a bird.

132
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,670
那里是专为特殊的孩子设立的...
It was a home for special children...

133
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,070
比如布朗温和维克多
like Bronwyn and Victor.

134
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,790
他们俩身体健硕  力能扛鼎
They were both as strong as 10 men.

135
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,740
还有休...
And Hugh...

136
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,310
休的身体里住着蜜蜂
Hugh had bees living inside him.

137
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
那艾玛呢
Where's Emma?

138
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,550
她可以飘浮
She could float.

139
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,630
她比空气还要轻
She was lighter than air.

140
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,030
必须穿特制的铅鞋
She had to wear special shoes made of lead

141
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,950
才不至于飘走
to keep her from floating away.

142
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,710
她现在在哪儿
Where is she now?

143
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,380
我觉得她应该还在岛上
She's still on the island, I believe.

144
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,470
我的父母送我去那里
My mama and papa sent me there...

145
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,910
和那些特殊的孩子一起生活
to live with the special children.

146
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,430
而你呢  泰利斯库  该睡觉啦
And now, Tygrysku, time for sleep.

147
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,430
他以前总叫我泰利斯库
He used to call me Tygrysku.

148
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,510
是波兰语"小老虎"的意思
It's Polish for "Little tiger."

149
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,190
简直是史上最不恰当的昵称
He couldn't have picked a less appropriate nickname.

150
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,750
我一直是个胆小鬼
I was always a chicken.

151
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,590
你爸妈为什么要把你送走
Why did your mom and dad send you away?

152
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,340
我们在波兰生活的地方并不安全
Well, where we lived in Poland, it wasn't safe.

153
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,310
那里有怪物
There were monsters.

154
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,750
什么样的怪物
What kind of monsters?

155
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,700
有着长手臂的巨型怪物
Huge ones, with long arms...

156
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,790
没有眼睛
and no eyes...

157
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,560
还长着这样的触手
and tentacles like this.

158
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,510
最愚蠢的是
The dumb thing was...

159
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,830
这么多年来  我一直相信着他讲的故事
for years, I actually believed his stories.

160
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,590
这是米勒德  他是隐形的
And this is Millard. He's invisible.

161
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,870
老师说这些只是加了特效的照片
My teacher says they were trick photos.

162
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,150
那你相信她吗
And did you believe her?

163
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,310
爸爸说你大概是旅行时
Dad says you probably found them

164
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,670
在某家旧货商店里
at a junk store someplace...

165
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,220
找到了这些照片
when you went traveling.

166
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,860
我绝不会骗你  小老虎
I would never lie to you, Tygrysku.

167
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,470
但关于儿童之家和那些怪物  你骗了我
But you did, about the home, the monsters.

168
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,110
爸爸告诉我了
Dad told me.

169
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,590
你父亲非常清楚
Your father knows very well

170
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,870
我在儿童之家生活过
I went to live in the children's home.

171
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,990
他说在波兰确实有怪物
He said there really were monsters in Poland...

172
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,270
只不过他们没有长触手
just not the kind with tentacles.

173
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,150
他说你被送到威尔士是因为有坏人作乱
He said you got sent to Wales 'cause there were bad people.

174
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,590
那些坏人想杀掉任何与众不同的人
People who wanted to kill anyone who was different.

175
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,710
我不想再聊这个话题了
I don't wanna talk about this anymore.

176
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,670
他说那些孩子们确实很特别
He said the children were special...

177
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,600
但并不像你所说的那样
but not the way you said.

178
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,150
我只是想说  明天我本来计划要写作的
I'm just saying, tomorrow was supposed to be a writing day.

179
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,990
你已经花了五年时间写那本破书
Five years and counting on that damn book.

180
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,130
你儿子明天生日  你抽一天陪陪他
And taking one day to be with your son on his birthday...

181
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,350
能有什么大不了的
is gonna be a big difference?

182
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,560
好吧
Fine.

183
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,260
找到什么好东西了吗
You find something good?

184
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,150
快看这张照片  真是棒极了
Oh, look at that. That's awesome.

185
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,350
你应该带着
You should take that.

186
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,390
来吧  伙计  我们走吧
Come on, buddy, let's roll.

187
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,830
你怎么能如此淡定
How are you so okay?

188
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,870
杰克  我跟他没有你们那么亲近
Jakey, you were a lot closer to him than I ever was.

189
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,870
他是位很了不起的爷爷
He was a wonderful grandpa...

190
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,870
但却不是位称职的父亲
but not such a great dad.

191
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,420
他的工作
Never seemed to pick a job...

192
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,910
经常要加班到深夜
that didn't involve late nights

193
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,670
或者出差很久
or long trips away, though.

194
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,310
我和你苏茜姑姑总觉得
Me and Aunt Susie always kind of thought

195
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,230
他也许背着你奶奶出轨了
he was, maybe, cheating on our mom.

196
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,680
抱歉  伙计  我知道你有多崇拜他
I'm sorry, buddy. I know how much you worshiped him...

197
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,470
但事实就是这样
but there it is.

198
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,790
惊不惊喜
Surprise!

199
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,100
生日快乐  杰克表哥
Happy birthday, Cousin Jake!

200
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,080
小杰  你能来一起过暑假实在太好了
J-dog, it's great you're coming to spend a summer with us.

201
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,430
回头给你看看我们的新船
Wait till you see the new boat.

202
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,360
真是迫不及待
Can't wait.

203
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,790
是我  苏茜姑姑
It's Aunt Susie.

204
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,670
我觉得你应该挺想打开看看
Thought you might wanna open this one.

205
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,990
是你爷爷留给你的
It's from your grandpa.

206
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,310
我整理他的遗物时发现的
Found it while I was packing up.

207
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,080
我觉得他大概是打算某一天交给你
I figured he meant to give it to you someday.

208
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,460
谢谢
Thanks.

209
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,630
致杰克  以及他尚未探索的那些世界
To Jake, and the worlds he has yet to discover.

210
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,630
我最亲爱的亚伯
My dearest Abe...

211
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,870
希望你收到明信片时一切安好
I hope this card finds you well.

212
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,070
我和孩子们非常渴望听到你的最新见闻
The children and I yearn to hear your news.

213
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,590
希望不久的将来你能再回来看看我们
I do hope you will visit us again soon.

214
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,550
我们非常想念你
We should so love to see you.

215
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,070
羡慕你的
With admiration...

216
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,420
阿尔玛·佩格林
Alma Peregrine.

217
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,910
寄出时间才过了两年
Hmm. Only two years ago.

218
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,070
我猜她应该还活着
I suppose it's possible she could still be alive.

219
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,780
没错
Right.

220
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,510
我可以去见见她
I could meet her.

221
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,110
也许甚至能搞清楚爷爷
Maybe even find out what it was

222
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,590
到底想让我们知道什么
Grandpa wanted me to know.

223
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,070
如果她死了呢
But what if she's dead?

224
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,240
戈兰医生
Dr. Golan...

225
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,590
我们非常担心
we are very concerned

226
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,470
杰克目前的精神状况
with Jake's state of mind right now.

227
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,010
我不可能放下手头的一切
There's no way I'm putting my life on hold

228
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,100
带你去威尔士
to take you to Wales.

229
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,910
爸爸可以带我去
Dad could take me.

230
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,670
他还可以观察鸟类
And he can look at birds...

231
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,980
写写书
and work on his book.

232
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,670
你也可以休息一下
It means you get a break.

233
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,190
正如戈兰医生所说
As Dr. Golan said...

234
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,590
也许这样我就能放开了
maybe I can move on.

235
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,700
放下过去的一切
Like, closure.

236
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,390
让他亲眼见一下这个儿童之家
Having an opportunity to see this children's home...

237
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,670
把现实和幻想分开
and separate fantasy from reality...

238
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,630
也许会有所帮助
may be helpful.

239
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,150
最起码
And at the very least...

240
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,880
这样的旅程可以给他机会
a trip like this provides a chance to...

241
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,190
与过去告别
say goodbye.

242
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,110
"凯恩霍尔姆岛  人口92"
"Cairnholm. Population of 92.

243
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,550
"这里最出名的地方是"
"Best known for its proximity...

244
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,710
"1915年遇难的奥古斯塔游轮"
"to the final resting place of the cruise liner Augusta...

245
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,230
"沉没点在附近"
"which sank in 1915.

246
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,710
"岛上只有一家酒店"
"There is just one hotel..."

247
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,420
就是我们要住的
That's us.

248
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,470
是啊  希望那里有波旁威士忌
Yeah. I hope there's bourbon.

249
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,390
杰克  快看
Jake, check it out.

250
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,670
那是只游隼
That's a peregrine falcon.

251
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,300
一只游隼  跟儿童之家校长名字一样啊
A peregrine, like the headmistress?

252
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,390
好吧
Sure.

253
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,190
你爷爷大概就是根据这个名字
That's probably where Grandpa came up

254
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,030
编出了校长能变成鸟的故事
with that whole turning into a bird thing.

255
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,670
又或者  也许那真的是她
Or maybe, maybe that's really her!

256
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,350
佩格林小姐
Hey, Miss Peregrine.

257
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,910
是我  杰克
It's me, Jake.

258
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,270
我是亚伯·波特曼的孙子
I'm Abe Portman's grandson.

259
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,590
请不要在我们头上拉屎
Please don't crap on us.

260
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,060
天哪  爸  我开玩笑的
Oh, my God. Dad, I'm kidding.

261
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,430
怎么回事  有人吗
What the... Hello?

262
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,580
有人吗
Hello?

263
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,790
有人在吗
Anybody home?

264
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,430
你们知道酒店经理在哪里吗
Any idea where I'd find the manager of this place?

265
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,630
正是在下  抱歉让你久等了
That's me. Sorry to keep you.

266
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,670
我刚推奥吉叔叔上厕所去了
Just helping Uncle Oggie to the loo.

267
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,830
我叫凯夫  楼上有房间
I'm Kev. There's room upstairs.

268
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
好极了
Oh, great.

269
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,190
我去去就回
I'll be back in a bit.

270
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,310
好的
Okay.

271
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,150
凯夫去给我们准备套房了
Kev's just getting our suite ready.

272
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,510
等房间准备好之前
Um, while we're waiting...

273
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,270
我们可以去海滩上看看
I thought maybe we could go check out the beach.

274
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,350
之前不是说去儿童之家吗
I thought we would go to the children's home.

275
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,790
鸟是在海滩边筑巢吗
Is the beach where the birds nest?

276
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,340
我觉得我们可以快速去看一下
I thought we could just check it out real quick.

277
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,110
我可以自己去儿童之家
I could go to the home by myself.

278
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,900
这样你就可以慢慢享受看鸟的时光了
Then, you can really take your time and enjoy it.

279
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,510
拜托  杰克  你妈肯定不让
Come on, Jakey. You know your mom would freak.

280
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,900
要是我找人带我一起去呢
What if we can find someone to take me?

281
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,860
伙计们
Hey, dudes.

282
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,910
-爸  别  -嘘  我来搞定
- Dad. Don't. - Shh! I got this.

283
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,720
我想问问你们谁有兴趣
I was just wondering if any of you guys...

284
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,210
帮忙给我儿子带带路
might be interested in taking my son here

285
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,310
他想去岛的另一边
to the other side of the island.

286
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,470
你们叫什么
So, what are your names?

287
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,630
我是虫仔  这是说唱歌手污迪
I'm Worm. This is MC Dirty D.

288
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,030
说唱歌手污大佬
MC Dirty Bizniz.

289
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,230
你不是改了名字吗
I thought you changed it.

290
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,320
没有
No.

291
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,670
不  你改了  记得吗
No, you did, remember?

292
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,190
露丝说"污大佬"
When Ruth said "MC Dirty Bizniz"

293
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,000
听起来像是拉裤子里了
made it sound like you cacked your trousers.

294
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,030
但是她说"污迪"听起来就像
Yeah, but she said "Dirty D" Sounded like

295
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,180
有个人卫生问题
a personal hygiene problem.

296
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,990
等等  这些是外号还是...
Wait. Are these, like, nicknames, or...

297
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,950
艺名  我们是威尔士最屌的说唱歌手
Stage names. We're the sickest rappers in Wales.

298
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,310
来  虫子  给美国佬秀一个
Go on, Worm. Show this Yank how it's done.

299
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,480
什么  现在吗
What? Now?

300
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,320
*我总在神父洞里烂醉如泥*
*I like to get wrecked down the Priest Hole*

301
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,240
*你爸来这里是因为他一贫如洗*
*Your dad's always here 'cause he's on the dole*

302
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,230
*我们的韵律  紧凑而随意*
*Our rhymes are tight yet I make it look easy*

303
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,470
*我们的节拍  让人啧啧称奇*
*Our beats are hot like chicken jalfrezi*

304
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,510
好吧  挺好的
Oh, yeah, no. It's good.

305
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,230
我们抄近路吧  迪
Should we take the shortcut, D?

306
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,510
这样节省时间  听我的
We'll get there quicker. Take it from me.

307
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,990
从什么下去吗
What, down here?

308
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,160
是的
Yeah.

309
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,320
走吧
Go.

310
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,870
这边吗
This way?

311
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
怎么回事...
What the...

312
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,150
这真的是去儿童之家的路吗
Is this even the way to the children's home?

313
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,990
直走穿过树林
Right through those trees.

314
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,430
没必要计较已经脏了的鞋  小子
No use crying over a lost shoe, boy-o.

315
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,110
儿童之家  到底发生了什么
The children's home. What happened to it?

316
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,980
德国人的一场空袭  炸弹落在了屋顶
A German air raid. Bomb fell right on the roof.

317
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,230
1943年9月3日
September the 3rd, 1943.

318
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,350
后来他们去了哪里
Where did they go after?

319
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,510
校长和孩子们
The headmistress and the children.

320
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,110
没有幸存者  可怜的小家伙们
Not one survivor. Poor little buggers.

321
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,470
他们确实很可爱
And they were lovely, too.

322
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,630
为什么他没告诉我们  他们全死了
Why didn't he tell us that they all died?

323
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,640
他离开去参军  三个月后
He leaves to join the army, and 3 months later,

324
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,870
所有他认识的人都死了
everyone he knows gets killed?

325
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,950
即使是你爷爷也不会当作睡前故事讲给你
Not even Grandpa could turn that into a bedtime story.

326
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,870
难怪他总是不愿与儿子亲近
Well, no wonder he was scared of being a dad...

327
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,670
害怕与人深交
being close to anyone.

328
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,780
听着
Listen.

329
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,110
你得和人好好聊聊  儿子
You need to talk about all this with someone, buddy.

330
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,870
我们应该打给戈兰医生
We should call Dr. Golan.

331
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,150
看来今天是个好日子
Certainly some enjoyment today.

332
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,730
你同意我今天
Er, do you mind if I go hang out

333
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,150
和那些小伙伴出去吗
with those other kids today?

334
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
他们邀请我的
They asked.

335
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,230
是吗  那太好了
Yeah? That's awesome.

336
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,510
亚伯
Abe?

337
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,390
不
No!

338
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
你是艾玛
You're Emma!

339
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,470
还有双胞胎
And the twins.

340
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,830
奥利芙
And Olive.

341
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,910
布朗温
And Bronwyn.

342
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,880
他是米勒德
And he's Millard.

343
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,590
不  你们死了
No, you're dead.

344
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,750
你们全死了
All of you, you're all dead.

345
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,670
他虽然能隐  但他还是死了
He's invisible, but he's still dead.

346
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,140
我们没死
None of us are dead.

347
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,870
我的天哪  是不是我死了
Oh, my God. Am I dead?

348
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,320
没有
No.

349
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,550
在楼里的时候
You called me Abe.

350
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,990
你叫我亚伯  为什么
In the house. Why?

351
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,220
你看起来像他
You looked like him.

352
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,880
只是乍一看而已
Just for a moment,

353
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,030
后来你就开始尖叫
before you started screaming...

354
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,070
冲了出去  还把自己撞晕了
running away, and concussing yourself.

355
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,710
等等  发生了什么
Wait. What's happening?

356
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,330
我们要等到海岸没人的时候
We're waiting until the coast is clear...

357
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,750
回到时光圈
before we go into the loop.

358
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,670
永远不知道有谁会看到
You never know who might be watching.

359
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,350
等等  要回到哪里
Wait. Before we go into what?

360
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,520
拜托  杰克
Please, Jake.

361
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,030
佩格林小姐在等着  她在渡口看到你了
Miss Peregrine's waiting. She saw you on the ferry.

362
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,310
她叫我们来接你
She sent us to get you.

363
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,630
你这是要去哪里
Where do you think you're going?

364
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,830
回我的房间
To my room.

365
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,350
我是这儿的住客
I'm a guest here.

366
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,990
你觉得这里像旅馆吗
Does this look like a hotel to you?

367
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,070
是啊
Yeah.

368
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,630
我有钥匙
No. I've got a key.

369
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,790
你去问老板  他会告诉你
Talk to the manager. He'll tell you.

370
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,700
我就是老板  小子
I'm the manager, boy.

371
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,350
他是美国人  也许他是当兵的
He's American. Maybe he's army?

372
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,670
胡说
Bollocks.

373
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,590
听他这口音  真可怕
Listen to his accent. It's terrible.

374
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,590
他是间谍
He's a spy.

375
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,910
什么
What?

376
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,270
我不是  我只是游客
No, I'm not. I'm a tourist.

377
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,790
不如我们用老方法
I say we should get the truth out of him

378
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,630
逼他开口
the old-fashioned way.

379
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,710
趴下
Get down!

380
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,790
快来
Come on!

381
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,670
杰克  上来
Jake, get on!

382
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,070
快点  上来  小子
Come on! Get on, boy!

383
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,070
你们居然是真的  全是真的
I can't believe you're real. You're all real!

384
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,790
我们一直想告诉你
We have been trying to tell you.

385
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,180
不过我也有特殊能力
But I'm special, too.

386
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,350
什么
What?

387
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,990
在酒馆的时候  奥利芙  你看到了
In the pub. Olive, you saw.

388
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,270
是吧  那些瓶瓶罐罐都凭空飞来飞去
Right? Everything was flying and breaking.

389
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
是我干的
And that was me!

390
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,870
是我用意念控制的
I was doing it with my mind.

391
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,910
不  是我做的
No, that was me.

392
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,200
米勒德
Millard?

393
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,900
是的
Yeah.

394
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,180
你没穿衣服吗
Are you naked?

395
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,310
是的
Yeah.

396
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,950
我不明白...
I don't...

397
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,110
1943年一颗炸弹落到这里
A bomb dropped on you in 1943.

398
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,630
现在是1943年
It is 1943.

399
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,470
1943年9月3日
September the 3rd, 1943.

400
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,350
每一天都是
All day, every day.

401
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,670
这是我们的时光圈
It's our loop.

402
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,780
你们很准时
Right on time.

403
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,950
佩格林小姐  很高兴见到你
Miss Peregrine. Delighted to meet you.

404
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,950
我希望酒馆老板和警察
I do hope I'm not going to have the pub landlord

405
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,910
不要再来敲我家门
knocking on my door with the police again.

406
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,670
这个月我已经被迫杀他们两次
I've had to kill them twice this month.

407
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,590
真够麻烦的
It's been terribly inconvenient.

408
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,870
米勒德摔了一些东西  就这些
Millard broke a few things. That's all.

409
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,550
还有奥利芙大概放了一小把火
And Olive may have started a tiny fire.

410
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,590
可他们当时要伤害杰克
But they were going to hurt Jake.

411
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,950
瞧瞧你
Look at you.

412
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,920
上一次亲爱的亚伯寄给我的照片里
The last time dear Abe sent me a photograph...

413
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,950
你还是个小不点
you were just a tiny tot.

414
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,710
别傻站着  进来吧
Don't just stand there. Come in.

415
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,270
茶要凉了
Your tea's getting cold.

416
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,830
你怎么知道我在酒馆的
How did you know about the pub?

417
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,030
你大概有99斤重  对吧
You weigh approximately 109 pounds, correct?

418
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,150
我不...
I don't...

419
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,600
布朗温和双胞胎在你跑走后6分钟回来
Bronwyn and the twins returned 6 minutes after you ran away.

420
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,030
我还是没听懂
I think I'm missing something.

421
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,290
更何况
And quite apart from the fact

422
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,610
你觉得酒馆很安全
that the perceived safety of the pub...

423
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,730
所以最有可能往那里逃
makes it the most likely place to which you would flee...

424
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,590
你跑到那儿要十八分钟
it would take you 18 minutes to run there.

425
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,720
艾玛和米勒德驾着马车
Emma and Millard would have been moments behind...

426
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,860
紧随其后
on the horse and trap,

427
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,670
以13公里时速前进
traveling at 8.2 miles per hour.

428
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,910
考虑到在酒馆制造混乱的时间
Factoring in some sort of kerfuffle at the pub...

429
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,190
以及返回时因多了你的重量所费的时间
and the return journey with your added weight...

430
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,310
你们会在4点13分到达这里
you would arrive here at 13 minutes past 4.

431
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,500
那么  你的茶里要加糖吗
Now, then, do you take sugar?

432
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,730
可以了  谢谢你  奥利芙
That'll do. Thank you, Olive.

433
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,190
没人喜欢煮过头的茶水
Nobody enjoys over-boiled tea.

434
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,350
我帮你拿吧  伊诺克
Let me help you with those, Enoch.

435
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,120
不必了  不想耽误你的茶话会
Don't bother. Wouldn't want to interrupt your tea party.

436
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,310
节哀顺变  杰克
I'm so sorry for your loss, Jake.

437
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,030
你都知道了
You know, then.

438
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,910
我知道如果亚伯还活着
I know if Abe were alive,

439
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,670
他会提前告诉我你要来
he would have told me you were coming.

440
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,070
我们去外面喝吧
Shall we take our tea outside?

441
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,280
谢谢
Thank you.

442
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,470
他去世前  让我来找你
Before he died, he told me to find you.

443
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,310
他想让我知道一些事
There was something he wanted me to know.

444
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,030
他说你能解释一切
He said you could explain everything.

445
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,550
没错
That's absolutely true.

446
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,020
我无法解释的事情很少
There are very few things I can't explain.

447
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,870
我们通常被称作
We're what's known, in common parlance,

448
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,710
"异能者"
as "Peculiar."

449
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,310
迟了51秒  菲奥娜
51 seconds late, Fiona.

450
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,020
对不起  佩格林小姐
Sorry, Miss Peregrine.

451
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,680
晚饭您需要多少胡萝卜
How many carrots do you need for supper?

452
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,190
一根就行了
Just one will do.

453
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,750
就像我刚才说的  有些人是异能者
As I was saying, some people are peculiar.

454
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,910
这是一种家族遗传的隐性基因
It's a recessive gene carried down through families.

455
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,070
有时候很多代传承下来
Yet, many generations can pass

456
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,540
却没有一个异能者出现
without a peculiar child being born.

457
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,910
这么多年异能者一直饱受迫害
And alas, peculiars have been persecuted through the ages.

458
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,190
因此  我们在这样的地方生活
Hence, we live in places like this.

459
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,200
在威尔士吗
In Wales?

460
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,350
任何地方都可以  只要选对了日子
Anywhere will do if you pick the right day.

461
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,070
可以了  菲奥娜
That's fine now, Fiona.

462
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,750
我是被称作时鸟的异能者
You see, I'm a type of peculiar called an Ymbryne.

463
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,270
意思就是我可以...
That means I can...

464
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,660
你可以变成鸟
Yeah, you turn into a bird.

465
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,550
没错
I do. Yes.

466
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,430
但这个能力没什么用
But that's not very useful.

467
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,550
时鸟最主要的技能是控制时间
An Ymbryne's main skill is the manipulation of time.

468
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,790
我们会选择安全的地方  选安全的一天
We choose a safe place, a safe day...

469
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,070
创造一个时光圈
and create a loop.

470
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,270
什么意思
What do you mean?

471
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,790
一个时光圈能持续24小时
A loop preserves the last 24 hours.

472
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,630
重置一次  就能在里面多生活一天
Reset the loop, and the day is yours to live in again.

473
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,550
每天都重置
Reset it daily...

474
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,630
就能永远待在里面了
and you can stay there forever.

475
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,870
与世隔绝  绝对安全
Entirely safe from the outside world.

476
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,550
刚刚好  布朗温  好孩子
Right on time, Bronwyn. Good girl.

477
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,950
这就是为什么我们时鸟
And that's why we Ymbrynes

478
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,630
总是负责照顾孩子们
are charged with the care of the young.

479
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,310
而且大家都不会变老
And no one ever gets older.

480
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,070
这样对大家都好
It's best for everyone this way.

481
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,470
我向你保证
I assure you.

482
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,950
每一任时鸟都承诺
Every Ymbryne commits herself...

483
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,270
要创造并维护这样的地方
to the creation and upkeep of a place like this.

484
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,950
给异能者孩子一个家
A home for peculiar children.

485
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,060
你想捣乱吗
You wanna muck around?

486
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,240
你的蜜蜂
Your bees.

487
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,750
接着
Get it!

488
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,270
你见过双胞胎了
You met the twins.

489
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,510
这是克莱儿
This is Claire.

490
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,470
米勒德  传球  我们要一起踢
Millard, pass the ball. We're playing together.

491
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,030
米勒德你见过了
Millard you met.

492
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,680
快
Ugh. Come on!

493
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,830
那是休
And that's Hugh.

494
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,870
不许耍赖  休
Stop cheating, Hugh.

495
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,870
米勒德  你又犯规了
Millard, that's a foul again.

496
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,310
我没有  里夫
No, it wasn't. Ref?

497
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,710
如果你俩一定要边踢边吵
If you two can't play soccer without squabbling...

498
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,390
我宁愿你们别玩了
I do wish you wouldn't play at all.

499
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,720
你以为裁判是干什么的
Do you know what a referee is?

500
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,630
下午好  我是贺拉斯
Good afternoon. I'm Horace.

501
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,800
很高兴认识你
Delighted to meet you.

502
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,240
当心
Careful!

503
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,870
这里极度需要新鲜血液
We sorely need some new blood here.

504
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,300
顺便说句  衣服不错
Super shirt, by the way.

505
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,640
谢谢
Thanks.

506
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,510
再加把劲儿
Try harder.

507
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,910
艾玛你已经认识了
You know Emma, of course.

508
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,750
我想介绍的差不多了
And I think that's everyone.

509
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,660
布朗温不是有个哥哥吗
Didn't Bronwyn have a brother?

510
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,590
对  维克多在楼上
Yes. Victor's upstairs.

511
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,120
等等  伊诺克和奥利芙去哪儿了
Wait, where did Enoch and Olive go?

512
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,020
天知道
Heaven knows.

513
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,560
自从我们去救杰克  他就在生闷气
Enoch's been off sulking ever since we went out to get Jake.

514
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,170
佩格林小姐  门口来了个警察
Miss Peregrine, there's a policeman at the door.

515
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,590
他说是关于酒馆的事
He says it's about the pub!

516
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,750
回头跟你算账  艾玛
We'll discuss this later, Emma.

517
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,870
不是他们的错
It wasn't their fault.

518
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,270
老实说  他们只是想帮忙
Honestly, they were just trying to help.

519
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,430
谢谢
Thanks.

520
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,430
你没我想得那么怂
You're not as wet as I thought.

521
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,030
她不会真的杀人  对吗
She's not really gonna kill anyone, is she?

522
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,270
只要她能谈妥就不会
Not if she can talk her way out of it.

523
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,110
你能帮帮我吗
Would you help me with something?

524
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,950
一般是伊诺克帮我  但是...
Enoch usually does it, but like I said,

525
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,390
他现在躲起来生闷气了
he's off sulking somewhere.

526
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,190
是因为我吗
Is that because of me?

527
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,960
他的独占欲很强
He's possessive.

528
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,230
需要我帮你什么呢
So, what did you need help with?

529
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,430
我的一项日常杂务
One of my daily chores.

530
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,980
把松鼠宝宝送回树上
Put the baby squirrel back in the tree.

531
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,300
什么松鼠宝宝
What baby squirrel?

532
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,830
每天都会这样吗
That happens every day?

533
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,270
就像时钟一样准
Like clockwork.

534
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,200
你可以把绳子绕到我的腰上吗
Now, would you mind tying that rope around my waist?

535
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,950
好
Uh, yeah.

536
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,430
好的  答应我要牢牢抓紧
Right. Promise to hold on tight.

537
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,070
我差点搞砸了
I nearly messed that up.

538
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,030
亚伯第一次也是
Abe did, too, the first time.

539
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,910
以前这是他的工作
This used to be his job.

540
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,590
艾玛  我得告诉你一件事
Emma, I need to tell you something.

541
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,900
他去世了
He's dead.

542
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,700
我知道
I know.

543
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,440
佩格林小姐猜到了  她总是能猜对
Miss Peregrine guessed, and she's always right.

544
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,920
没关系
It's okay.

545
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,910
很早之前我就跟他道过别了
I said goodbye to him a long time ago.

546
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,190
你们曾经很亲密吗
Were you close?

547
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,230
我以为我们很亲密
I thought we were.

548
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,950
有那么一阵子
For a while.

549
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,750
大概是我误会了
But I suppose not.

550
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,910
请问  他也像你们一样吗
Can I ask, was he like you?

551
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,710
他跟你一样  杰克
He was like you, Jake.

552
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,830
我得去换衣服  快吃晚餐了
I need to go and change for supper.

553
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,630
你会和我们一起吃晚餐吗
Will you be dining with us?

554
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,950
我不能待太晚
I can't stay out late.

555
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,750
五点半吃晚餐
Supper's at 5:30.

556
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,110
那还真早
Uh... That is pretty early.

557
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,390
我们年龄不一
The fact we're not all eight years old

558
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,110
佩格林小姐也很是为难
seems to have eluded Miss Peregrine.

559
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,110
你可以穿亚伯的衣服
You can borrow some of Abe's clothes.

560
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,310
他的房间在阁楼上
His room's in the attic.

561
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,640
杰克
Jake!

562
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,550
来正式和伊诺克认识一下吧
Come and meet Enoch properly.

563
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,830
你肯定觉得自己格格不入吧
You must feel pretty out of place.

564
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,950
别担心
Don't worry.

565
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,270
我习惯了
I'm used to it.

566
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,620
不  我没有担心
No. I wasn't worried.

567
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,510
不过同为男人  给你一条忠告
Some advice for you though, man to man.

568
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,000
如果你只是因为喜欢艾玛就想留下
If you're thinking of staying just because you like Emma...

569
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,360
别费劲了
don't bother.

570
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,820
告诉你  几十年前她就发誓远离爱情了
You see, she swore off romance decades ago...

571
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,310
因为一次爱情让她心碎了
when she got her heart broken.

572
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,030
而且她永远不会改变心意  所以...
And she's never gonna change her mind. So...

573
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,950
伊诺克  我没有
Enoch, I wasn't...

574
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,880
你这是在干什么
What are you doing?

575
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,790
他很厉害吧
Isn't he amazing?

576
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,380
你做了什么
What did you do?

577
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,470
这个吗
This?

578
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,150
杰克  好玩的部分还没到呢
Jake, this isn't even the fun part.

579
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,920
想知道好玩的部分是什么吗
Do you want to see the fun part?

580
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,980
他们就像木偶
They're like puppets.

581
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,580
我说什么他们就做什么
Just do anything I tell them.

582
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,590
用人更好玩呢
It's even more fun with people.

583
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,880
你真该看看以前
You should have seen some of

584
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,390
他们在我父母葬礼上的表现
the epic battles they used to have...

585
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,870
堪称史诗般的战斗
at my parents' funeral parlor.

586
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,430
你还需要领带
You'll need a necktie.

587
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,630
我爷爷这些年远游都干什么了
So what did my grandpa do when he was traveling?

588
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,190
拜访其他时光圈
Visited other loops.

589
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,230
真的吗  去做什么
Really? To do what?

590
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,630
杰克  有些问题
Jake, there's some questions

591
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,710
我不能回答  好吗
that I can't answer, all right?

592
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,910
所以为了我好  请你...
So, it would be a lot easier for me if you just...

593
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,110
别再问了
stopped asking them.

594
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,050
你干什么呀
Hey! What are you doing?

595
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,080
米勒德
Millard.

596
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,070
去穿上衣服
Go and put some clothes on.

597
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,310
有礼貌的人是不会裸体上餐桌的
Polite persons do not take their supper in the nude.

598
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,510
好啦知道啦
All right. All right.

599
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,590
你可以坐这里  杰克
You can sit here, Jake.

600
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,840
快看伊诺克
Look at Enoch.

601
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,660
他吃醋了
He's jealous.

602
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,830
我为什么要吃醋
Why would I be jealous?

603
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,950
奥利芙就是嫁给他  我也无所谓
Olive can go marry Jake, for all I care.

604
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,500
别这么小气  伊诺克  她也不想嫁
Don't be mean, Enoch. She doesn't want to.

605
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,590
她只是因为来了客人很开心
She's just excited to have a visitor.

606
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,510
没有人要结婚
Nobody is marrying anybody.

607
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,430
趁饭还没凉赶紧吃吧
Now, eat up your food before it gets cold.

608
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,350
休
Hugh!

609
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,310
你的网呢
Where's your net?

610
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,030
休  你不能再这样了  休
Hugh! You have to stop doing this, Hugh.

611
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,190
快走开
Go away!

612
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,630
你肯定觉得很奇怪吧  杰克
Must be very strange for you, Jake.

613
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,950
见到了你祖父的朋友们
Meeting your grandfather's friends.

614
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,710
穿越到了另一个世纪
Visiting another century.

615
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,720
你们的世界里有飞船吗  杰克
Are there spaceships in your time, Jake?

616
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,310
像飞侠哥顿故事里写的那样
Like the Flash Gordon books.

617
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,560
好了  奥利芙
Now, now, Olive.

618
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,390
我不是说过吗  不要乱提问
What did I say about asking questions?

619
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,710
我们不探讨未来
We don't discuss the future here.

620
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,390
我们只享受过去的开心生活
We enjoy living in the good old here and now.

621
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,880
克莱儿  你怎么不吃
Claire, why aren't you eating?

622
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,990
因为杰克在  她不好意思
She's embarrassed in front of Jake.

623
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,710
不用  请随意
Don't be. Please.

624
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,830
杰克  你有什么特殊能力
So, Jake, what's your peculiarity?

625
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,590
我没有特殊能力
Oh, I'm not peculiar.

626
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,900
正因如此  朋友们
And that, my friends,

627
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,830
他不会留下
is why he will not be staying with us...

628
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,430
我们怎么劝他都没用
no matter how hard we try to persuade him.

629
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,190
我们说过这个问题了  杰克只是来做客
We've spoken about this. Jake is just visiting.

630
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,580
也许他想留下呢
He might want to stay.

631
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,510
你想留下对不对  杰克
Don't you want to stay, Jake?

632
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,390
你是说今晚  还是
Tonight? Or...

633
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,670
永远  你应该永远和我们在一起
Forever. You should stay forever.

634
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,180
他又不是不能走  为什么还要留下
Why would he, if he doesn't have to?

635
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,390
他可以活在外面的世界  慢慢变老
He can live out there, grow older...

636
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,070
不像我们  他能拥有幸福的一生
have a good time instead.

637
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,800
他会离开的  像他祖父一样
He'll leave, just like his grandfather did.

638
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,120
艾玛
Emma!

639
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,470
抱歉
Excuse me.

640
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,640
她要去哪里
Where's she going?

641
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,940
你有点过分了  伊诺克
That wasn't nice, Enoch.

642
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,640
你很清楚亚伯当初为什么离开
You know perfectly well why Abe left us.

643
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,800
他去参军
To join the army.

644
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,470
遇到了一位小姐  吃了结婚蛋糕
And then he met a lady, and had a nice wedding cake...

645
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,310
生了个可爱的孩子
and a lovely little baby.

646
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,400
孩子们
Children.

647
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,620
我知道你们都想认识新朋友
I know you'd all like a new friend...

648
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,150
但我想杰克在佛罗里达也有朋友
but I'm sure Jake has plenty of his own back in Florida.

649
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,910
我先去接电话
I think you should all get ready

650
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,380
大家准备进入电影时间吧
for movie time while I answer that.

651
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,550
你以前都让我们等你回来的
But you always let us stay for it.

652
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,110
喂  我是亚伯
Hello, this is Abe.

653
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,470
大家都好吗
How is everyone?

654
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,080
给你多加了棉花糖  杰克
Yours has extra marshmallows, Jake.

655
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,430
米勒德  穿上睡衣
Millard, put some pajamas on.

656
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,950
这里太热了
It's too hot in here.

657
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,310
别抱怨了
Stop moaning.

658
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,560
请让让
Excuse me.

659
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,350
我爷爷跟我讲过
My grandpa told me about this.

660
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,870
贺拉斯能投影他的梦  对吧
Horace projects his dreams, right?

661
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,470
他以前总听收音机
He used to listen to the radio.

662
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,350
把内容倒背如流了  也就没意思了
Gets tedious when you know every word off by heart.

663
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,190
真不错  我要了
Splendid. I'll take it.

664
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,870
他的梦大多都是关于衣服的
He dreams about clothes mostly.

665
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,230
很高兴认识你
Delighted to meet you.

666
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,830
顺便说句  衣服不错
Super shirt, by the way.

667
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,230
这是他什么时候梦到的
When did he dream this?

668
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,670
昨晚
Last night.

669
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,390
他的梦有时能够预言
Some of his dreams are prophetic.

670
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,790
但是  大多都会梦到衣服
But, mostly they're about clothes.

671
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,230
预言是指  能看到未来吗
Prophetic as in, he can see into the future?

672
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,430
时鸟  她是谁
An Ymbryne. Who is she?

673
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,230
佩格林小姐  你认识她吗
Miss Peregrine, do you know her?

674
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,440
别傻了
Don't be silly.

675
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,750
贺拉斯肯定只是做了个噩梦  没什么
Horace must have just had a bad dream. That's all.

676
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,320
就这样吧  谢谢你  贺拉斯
That's quite enough of that. Thank you, Horace.

677
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,590
我想我该走了
I should probably get going.

678
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,860
要是愿意  你可以在这里过夜
You could stay the night, if you wanted to.

679
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,950
不然还得摸黑走夜路回去
Rather than walk home alone in the dark.

680
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,310
但是岛上很安全的  不是吗
But the island is very safe, isn't it?

681
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,700
当然了
Of course!

682
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,470
我只是说路上有些崎岖
I only meant the path is dreadfully bumpy.

683
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,780
他可能会摔跤
Jake could trip.

684
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,710
不如你送他走小路
Perhaps you could show him the shortcuts.

685
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,750
这样他就不用摔跤了
Should he ever need to avoid bumps.

686
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,890
至少留下来看完重置吧  杰克
Won't you at least stay to see the reset, Jake?

687
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,130
真的特别壮观
It's really quite spectacular.

688
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,950
-就是  -留下嘛  杰克
- Yeah! - Stay, Jake!

689
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,270
快来  杰克
Come on, Jake!

690
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,270
*小兔子快跑  小兔子快跑*
*Run, rabbit, run, rabbit*

691
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,870
*跑跑跑*
*Run, run, run*

692
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:11,950
*别让农夫拍手叫好好好好*
*Don't give the farmer his fun, fun, fun*

693
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,990
*没有兔子派  他也过得很愉快*
*He'll get by without his rabbit pie*

694
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:23,350
*所以小兔子快跑  小兔子快跑跑跑*
*So run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run*

695
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,380
*小兔子快跑  小兔子快跑*
*Run, rabbit, run, rabbit*

696
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,430
*砰砰砰  那是农夫的枪声*
*Bang, bang, bang, bang goes the farmer's gun*

697
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,710
*别让农夫拍手叫好好好好*
*Don't give the farmer his fun, fun, fun*

698
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:33,430
*没有兔子派  他也过得很愉快*
*He'll get by without his rabbit pie*

699
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,190
太令人惊叹了
That was fantastic.

700
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,980
什么声音
What was that?

701
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,830
是我的手机
It was my phone.

702
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,750
在时光圈里一直没信号  现在有了...
It's been dead the whole time in the loop. I guess now...

703
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,230
手机
Your phone?

704
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,480
对  就像电话
Yeah. Like a telephone.

705
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,980
你可以打给别人
You can call people...

706
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,150
发送文字信息
send written messages.

707
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,150
等等  有个好功能
Wait, you'll love this.

708
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,910
你可以拿它拍照
You can take a picture.

709
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,350
按那个  那里  对
Press that, there. Yeah.

710
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,980
你看
See?

711
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,630
怎么了
What's wrong?

712
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,670
只是想到有一天你会长大
It's just funny to think that one day, you'll grow up.

713
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,030
就像亚伯一样
Like Abe did.

714
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,350
结婚生子
Get married, have children.

715
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,660
甚至有了孙辈
Grandchildren.

716
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,590
你可能还会给他们看这张照片
You might even show them this photograph.

717
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,470
而我还在这里
And I'll still be here.

718
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,590
你难道不能离开这里吗
Couldn't you leave some day?

719
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,510
如果你想的话  能不能活在当下
And live in the present, if you wanted to?

720
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:11,680
不
No.

721
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,490
在你的世界里  过不了几分钟
More than a few minutes in your time

722
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,150
我落下的那些年月就会补上
and the years would catch up.

723
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,070
你会变老
You would age?

724
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,750
我想它是贺拉斯梦里的那只时鸟
I think it's the Ymbryne from Horace's dream.

725
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,990
你确定这不是普通的鸟吗
Are you sure it's not just a bird?

726
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,670
我不知道  它难道不会变身吗
I don't know, wouldn't it change?

727
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,070
不能  受了伤就变不了
She can't. Not if she's hurt.

728
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,750
我得把她带回家  你走吧
I need to take her inside. You should go.

729
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,670
求你别说话了
Please don't say anything else.

730
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,310
我讨厌分别
I hate goodbyes.

731
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,240
我明天会回来的
I'll come back tomorrow.

732
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,830
不用急  我永远都在这里
There's no hurry. I'll be here forever.

733
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,730
我在这个破岛到处找你
I've been all over this damn island.

734
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:07,870
你跑哪儿去了
Where the hell were you?

735
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,110
我正在往回走
Um, I was just on my way back.

736
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,910
对不起  我没注意时间
I'm sorry. I lost track of time.

737
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,420
我跟虫仔和污迪玩得太开心了
I was having a blast with Worm and Dirty D.

738
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,420
污迪
Dirty D?

739
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,710
好吧
You know what?

740
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,070
这样很棒  很健康
This is good. This is healthy.

741
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,910
你交了奇怪的朋友
You're making weird friends...

742
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,950
做了青少年该做的事情
and doing teenage stuff.

743
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,120
我觉得这很正常
I think this is normal.

744
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,710
我想戈兰医生也会赞成的
I'm sure Doctor Golan will approve.

745
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,590
你们俩美国佬
Hey, you. American!

746
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,950
过来
Get over here.

747
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,940
看  他们也在
Oh, look. There they are.

748
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,310
污迪和虫仔
There's D-Bag and Worm Man.

749
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,590
是你们干的吗
Did you do this?

750
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,310
什么  不是
What? No.

751
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,950
当然不是
Of course not.

752
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,590
不是我们干的
It wasn't us.

753
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,930
先生  我不知道这里发生了什么
Listen, sir. I don't know what happened here.

754
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,990
但是我儿子和他朋友一整天都在一起
But my son and his friends have been together all day.

755
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,430
杰克绝不会做这种事情
Jake would never do anything like this.

756
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,110
胡说  我们今天根本没见过他
Bollocks! We haven't seen him!

757
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,390
你昨天是花钱请我们
You paid us yesterday.

758
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,310
我们怎么会免费跟他玩
Why would we hang out with him today for free?

759
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,150
杰克  你到底有没有和他们在一起
Jake? Were you with them or not?

760
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,630
没有  对不起
No. I'm sorry.

761
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,470
但你不会真以为我能做出这种事吧
But you don't seriously think I could do this?

762
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,310
先生  我们先走了
I think we're done here, sir.

763
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,990
你能给我捎个信吗
Can you pass on a message for me?

764
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,150
请你告诉戈兰医生
Can you tell Doctor Golan...

765
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,710
要不是她怂恿这次荒谬的旅行
that if she hadn't encouraged this cockamamie trip...

766
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,020
也许我儿子就不会
maybe my son wouldn't be

767
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,850
整天在一个废弃房子里待着
moping around all day in a derelict house...

768
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,710
待到整个人都神经崩溃了
having a goddamn breakdown!

769
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,820
人呢
Hello?

770
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,510
爸爸  我没有
Dad, I'm not.

771
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,320
我很好
I'm fine.

772
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,190
不  你不好
No. You're not.

773
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,310
你一点都不好  杰克
You're not fine, Jake.

774
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,990
我们就不应该来这里
Coming here was a terrible, terrible idea.

775
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,630
对不起我撒谎了  我只是想...
Look, I'm sorry I lied. I just wanted...

776
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,300
把你的闹钟设到早上8点
Just set your alarm for 8:00 a.m.

777
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,710
我想早点到海滩
I wanna get to the beach early.

778
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,970
然后就一起
The rest of the time we're stuck

779
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,140
待在这个破岛上
on this craphole island...

780
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,710
一刻也不分开
we're sticking together.

781
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,030
你要去哪里
Where are you going?

782
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,230
下楼喝一杯
Downstairs for a drink.

783
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,200
亲爱的佩小姐
Dear Miss Peregrine...

784
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,390
我不想惊扰到你
I don't wish to alarm you...

785
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,120
这是我一个线人寄给我的
but one of my informants sent me this.

786
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,390
看来巴伦团队的一些成员
It would appear that some of Mr. Barron's group...

787
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,390
此刻正在英国黑池
are in Blackpool, England.

788
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,950
如果我没记错
If I recall...

789
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,420
艾沃赛特女士在那里有个时光圈
Miss Avocet has a loop there.

790
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,990
请提醒她  并建议她
Please warn her and suggest...

791
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,990
立刻重建一个时光圈
that she make a new one right away...

792
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,270
隐藏起来
well-hidden.

793
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,000
请你照顾好自己
And take the greatest care yourself.

794
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,910
爱你的亚伯
With love, Abe.

795
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,070
2016年1月
January, 2016.

796
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,510
准备好登陆海滩了吗
Who's ready to hit the beach?

797
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,670
我的天...
Oh, my...

798
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,360
难以置信
Unbelievable.

799
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,030
在巢区的正中间搭帐篷
Right in the middle of a nesting area?

800
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,470
什么蠢货会这么干
What kind of idiot does that?

801
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,670
其实主要的巢区在那边
Actually, the main nesting area is over there.

802
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,830
如果你有兴趣  我可以带你去看
I can show you if you'd like.

803
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,190
能遇到一位观鸟同好真是太棒了
It's marvelous to meet a fellow bird spotter.

804
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,350
我是约翰·拉蒙特
John Lamont.

805
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,630
我是富兰克林·波特曼  这是我儿子杰克
Franklin Portman. This is my son, Jake.

806
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,500
约翰·拉蒙特
John Lamont.

807
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,240
你的镜头真是太炫了
That's a hell of a camera you got there.

808
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,670
谢谢  确实相当棒
Oh, thanks. It's absolutely fantastic.

809
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:16,190
我来这里是为我的著作拍些照片
I'm here to do some snaps for a book I'm writing.

810
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,190
两位先生是来这里度假的吗
So, you gentlemen here on holiday?

811
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,150
真不幸  她的手臂跟鸟的翅膀一样
Unfortunately, her wings were flapping

812
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,270
上下摇摆
as much as the bird's!

813
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,560
我觉得你们想的
I think you fellas are

814
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,850
可能是另外一种"鸟"
thinking of another kind of bird.

815
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,440
你今天不去海滩了吗
So, you're not going to the beach today?

816
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,350
何必呢
What's the point?

817
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,110
既然那人要把凯恩霍尔姆岛
If that guy is gonna cover Cairnholm

818
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,670
写进他那浮夸高档的书里
in some big, glossy book...

819
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,470
肯定没人会看我的那本书了
no one's gonna even wanna look at mine.

820
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,910
还不如好好睡个午觉
Might just have a nice afternoon nap.

821
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,270
我猜你们今天早上
I don't suppose you saw Uncle Oggie

822
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,190
没在路上看到奥吉叔叔  是吗
on your travels this morning, did you?

823
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,910
通常这时候他应该到了
He's usually here by now.

824
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,190
我可以去找找他
I could go look for him.

825
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,390
你哪也不许去
You're not going anywhere.

826
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,430
杰克  你回来了  来和我们玩吧
Jake, you're back! Come and play!

827
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,070
我得去见佩小姐
I need to see Miss Peregrine first.

828
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,590
你知道她在哪吗
Do you know where she is?

829
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,410
经过那些黑暗的日子...
From the darkest days,

830
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,580
加拿大军队...
the Canadian army...

831
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,550
杰克  你回来了  太棒了
Jake. You're back. How wonderful!

832
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,280
它怎么样了
How's it doing?

833
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,230
艾玛说它是只时鸟
Emma said it was an Ymbryne.

834
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,230
是她  不是它
"She." Not "It."

835
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,270
时鸟总是女性
Ymbrynes are always female.

836
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,830
艾玛说得对
And Emma was quite correct.

837
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,590
这位是艾沃赛特女士
This is Miss Avocet.

838
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,550
她的时光圈在英国黑池
Her loop's in Blackpool. England.

839
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,430
你偷看了我的私人信件  杰克
That was a private letter, Jake.

840
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,630
巴伦先生是谁
Who is Mr. Barron?

841
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,070
佩小姐  如果我爷爷
Miss Peregrine, if my Grandpa

842
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,110
跟什么危险人物有纠葛
was involved with dangerous people...

843
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,830
我得告诉警察
I need to tell the police.

844
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,120
警察
Police?

845
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,670
你是说亚伯的死有蹊跷吗
Are you implying Abe died an unnatural death?

846
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,790
我发现他横尸在树林里
I found him in the woods...

847
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,990
双眼不见了
with his eyes missing.

848
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:28,990
这其中肯定有蹊跷吧
I'd say that was pretty unnatural.

849
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,830
若非必要  我绝不讨论令人不快的事
Unless essential, I don't discuss unpleasant matters.

850
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,460
时鸟的职责是保护孩子们  杰克
An Ymbryne's duty is to protect children, Jake.

851
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,270
我不是孩子
I'm not a child.

852
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,880
他想让你告诉我全部真相
He wanted you to tell me everything!

853
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,830
那你可真惨
Oh. How frustrating for you.

854
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,710
佩小姐有她的规矩
Between Miss Peregrine's rules...

855
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,000
而我的室友们又不想把你吓跑
and my housemates' little pact not to scare you off...

856
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,150
好像没人会告诉你真相
it's like no one's telling you anything!

857
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,310
那不如你来说吧
Why don't you, then?

858
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,830
反正你也不希望我留下
It's not like you want me here.

859
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,820
伊诺克  不行  你保证过的
Enoch, you can't. You promised.

860
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,190
奥利芙说得对
Olive's right.

861
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,330
不过我确实知道一个人
I do know someone who can get away

862
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,710
可以随意违反规矩
with breaking rules though.

863
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,630
你要不要去见他
Want to meet him?

864
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,640
伊诺克  别这样  求你了
Enoch, don't do this. Please!

865
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,170
你想跟我和杰克待在一起
You want to spend time with me and Jake,

866
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,340
你想让大家一起玩
we can all play together.

867
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,830
这是你说的
That's what you said.

868
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,910
这不是都在吗
Here we all are.

869
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,870
让开  奥利芙
Move, Olive.

870
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,280
你要是这样的话
If you're going to be like that,

871
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,660
我就不跟你做朋友了
then I don't want to be your friend.

872
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,390
伊诺克  你别去打扰维克多  布朗温会不开心
Enoch, leave Victor alone. It really upsets Bronwyn.

873
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,350
别吵吵了  菲奥娜
Stop fussing, Fiona.

874
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,120
你不觉得杰克应该跟每个人都见见吗
Don't you think Jake should meet everybody?

875
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,760
他想吓跑你  杰克
He's trying to frighten you away, Jake.

876
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,670
他以前总是嫉妒亚伯  现在又嫉妒你
He was always jealous of Abe. And now he's jealous of you.

877
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,230
你来跟我们一起玩吧
Come and play with us instead.

878
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,270
我挺想见见维克多的
I'd quite like to meet Victor.

879
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,070
你先请
After you.

880
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,630
你好  维克多
Hello, Victor.

881
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,870
我是杰克  抱歉打扰...
I'm Jake. I'm sorry to disturb...

882
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:22,780
他听不见的
Yeah, he can't hear you.

883
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,150
杰克你好  我是维克多
Hello, Jake. I'm Victor.

884
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,670
你想不想知道我是怎么死的
Do you want to know what killed me?

885
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,470
你来了  伊诺克跟你在一起吗
There you are. Is Enoch with you?

886
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,070
我们该去散步了
It's time for our daily walk.

887
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,460
艾玛  是谁杀了维克多
Emma, who killed Victor?

888
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,310
是不是那群白眼人
Was it the people with the white eyes?

889
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,110
我说过  你不要再提问了
I asked you not to ask questions.

890
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:15,270
我爷爷死的那天晚上我看到过一个
I saw one the night my grandpa died.

891
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,470
一个男人
A man.

892
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,470
如果真是这样
If it really was one,

893
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,190
你得告诉佩小姐
you have to tell Miss Peregrine.

894
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,470
你能从照片里认出他来吗
Could you recognize him from a photograph?

895
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,030
你有照片吗
Do you have one?

896
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,310
跟我来  我想一个人待着的时候会去那里
Come on. There's somewhere I go to be alone.

897
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,870
我在里面藏有东西
I have things there.

898
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:08,510
是这里吗
Is this the place?

899
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,870
不是  但是要从这里过去
No. This is how we get there.

900
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,230
艾玛  你的鞋
Oh! Emma! Your shoes!

901
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,830
是铅鞋
Lead shoes!

902
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,350
欢迎来到我的秘密基地
Welcome to my secret hideout.

903
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,470
你是怎么...
How did you...

904
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,620
用空气
Air.

905
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:44,990
这是我的异能
It's my peculiarity.

906
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,510
可以任意控制空气
It does what I want.

907
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:07,750
杰克
Jake...

908
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,550
你爷爷退役前...
before your grandfather retired...

909
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,870
让我帮他保管好这个
he asked me to keep this safe.

910
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,350
这是我爷爷的旧地图
This is my grandpa's old map.

911
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,070
上面会显示时光圈的位置
It shows you where the loops are.

912
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,910
就是他
That's him!

913
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,750
我看到的就是他
That's the man I saw.

914
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,910
-他是谁  -是巴伦
- Who is he? - That's Barron.

915
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,080
他是老大
He's the leader.

916
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,750
什么老大
The leader of what?

917
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,790
他们到底是什么人
Who are these people?

918
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,910
是坏人  暗黑异能者
Bad people. Bad peculiars.

919
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,590
亚伯穷其一生追捕着他们
Abe dedicated his life to hunting them down.

920
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,590
但他从未找到这些人
These are the ones he never found.

921
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,270
什么叫追捕
What do you mean, hunting?

922
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,070
他们会洗劫时光圈
They raided loops.

923
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:16,630
把里面的孩子赶尽杀绝
Whole homes full of children left for dead.

924
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,310
亚伯杀他们是为了救人
Abe took lives to save lives.

925
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,310
你出生后他才退休  他是为了保护你
He only retired when you were born to protect you.

926
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,460
保护我什么
From what?

927
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,660
如果我告诉你实情
If I tell you the rest,

928
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,830
你要保证不被吓跑
you have to promise not to run away.

929
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:36,110
杰克  你属于这里
Jake, you belong here.

930
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,670
你明知我不属于这里
You know I don't.

931
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,790
我跟你们不一样
I'm not like you.

932
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,750
我是普通人
I'm just ordinary.

933
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,270
不  你不是
No, you're not.

934
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,470
杰克
Jake...

935
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,510
只有异能者才能进入时光圈
only a peculiar can enter a time loop.

936
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,150
不  那不可能啊
No. That can't be right.

937
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,190
我应该能感觉到
I would know.

938
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,160
好
Fine.

939
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,830
那我给你看个别的东西
Then I'll show you something else.

940
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,460
快点  不然你就看不到了
Hurry. You'll miss it.

941
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:25,670
时鸟通常会选择好日子来制造时光圈
Ymbrynes usually pick the perfect day to create a loop.

942
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,800
但是佩小姐当时制造这个时光圈有点匆忙
But Miss Peregrine had to make this one in a rush.

943
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,080
为什么
Why?

944
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,890
因为当时德国人的炸弹就要掉下来了
Because the Germans were about to drop a bomb on the house.

945
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,350
重点在于
The point is...

946
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:37,350
1943年9月3日并不完美
September the 3rd, 1943 wasn't perfect.

947
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:40,910
杀死维克多的东西又回来了
The thing that killed Victor came back.

948
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,110
等等  小心
Wait! Watch out!

949
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,100
你会让她分心的
You'll put her off!

950
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,390
你能看到  对吗
You can see it, can't you?

951
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,430
别人都看不到
No one else can.

952
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,070
它是隐形的  杰克
It's invisible, Jake.

953
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:47,680
这是亚伯最厉害的天赋
That was Abe's greatest gift of all.

954
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,430
他能够看到那些怪物
He could see the monsters.

955
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,750
我们称之为虚空怪兽
We call them Hollowgast.

956
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,100
简称虚怪
Hollows for short.

957
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:05,910
我爷爷跟我讲过有人变成了怪物
My grandpa told me about people who turn into monsters.

958
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:07,430
说的就是他们吗
Is that what they are?

959
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,430
我会跟你解释一切  杰克
I will explain everything, Jake.

960
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,750
看来现在这成了我的责任
I fear it's my duty now, considering.

961
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:13,970
但你要明白  我这样做
But you should know that in doing so,

962
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,160
违背了我曾许下的郑重承诺
I'm breaking a solemn promise.

963
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,950
你出生时我就知道你是异能者
I knew you were peculiar when you were born.

964
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,830
但是你爷爷什么都不让我跟你说
But your grandfather forbid me to tell you anything.

965
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,310
他最大的愿望就是你能拥有平凡的童年
His dearest wish was for you to have an ordinary childhood.

966
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:28,630
我童年是够平凡的
I definitely had that.

967
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,310
他想等你成年之后再告诉你实情
He intended to tell you the truth when you turned 18.

968
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:36,310
希望他的睡前故事能够做个铺垫
He hoped his bedtime stories would pave the way.

969
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,510
我的书来了
Here's my book.

970
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,350
许多年前
Many years ago...

971
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,790
我们异能者出现了分化
a splinter faction emerged among our people.

972
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,520
有些异能者厌倦了时光圈内的生活  心生不满
Disaffected peculiars tired of living in loops.

973
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,630
也就是巴伦先生
That's Mr. Barron.

974
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,830
他认为只要想办法获取
He believed that by harnessing the essence

975
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,550
时鸟异能的精华
of an Ymbryne's powers...

976
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,470
他和他的同伙就能获得永生
he and his cronies could gain immortality...

977
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,990
并能在时光圈外生活
and be able to live outside loops.

978
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,310
他开始了一项实验
He devised an experiment.

979
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,310
他绑架了一只时鸟
He kidnapped an Ymbryne...

980
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:19,610
毫不关心
not knowing or caring

981
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:21,650
这次实验是否会危及她的生命
whether she would survive the experiment.

982
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,870
但巴伦和他同伙的命运
But the fate of Barron and his group

983
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,970
却更加骇人听闻
was more horrifying still.

984
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,900
巴伦为什么没变成怪物
Why didn't Barron turn into one?

985
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,790
他也变成了怪物
He did.

986
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,590
但是几年之后...
But years later...

987
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,950
他找到了一种逆转这种后果的方法
he found a way to reverse the effects.

988
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,590
重新变成人类
To regain humanity.

989
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:50,110
他们没有变成永生的神  而是变成了虚怪
They had become not immortal gods, but Hollows.

990
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,580
隐形的野兽  危险...
Invisible beasts, dangerous...

991
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,790
冷血  致命
cold-blooded, deadly.

992
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,680
记得我跟你说过他们洗劫了时光圈吗
Remember I told you they raided loops?

993
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:58,830
这就是原因
This is why.

994
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,440
巴伦发现了通过吸食
Barron discovered that by consuming

995
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,670
其他异能者的眼睛
the eyes of other peculiars...

996
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,950
特别是孩子们的眼睛...
especially children...

997
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,990
他就可以开始转化
he began to change.

998
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,590
吸食足够多的眼睛
Consume enough, and a Hollow

999
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,470
虚怪就能完全恢复人形
can fully regain its human form.

1000
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:37,990
大家用餐愉快
Bon appetit.

1001
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,030
就像巴伦和他的一些朋友所做的那样
Just as Barron and some of his friends did.

1002
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:52,150
其他人只能继续做虚怪
The rest of them are stuck as Hollows.

1003
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:58,190
你是说巴伦吃了我爷爷的...
Are you saying that Barron ate my grand...

1004
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,050
他自己已经不需要眼睛了
He needs no more eyes himself.

1005
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,830
但可能他让一只虚怪去找了你的爷爷  没错
But I fear he led a Hollow to your grandfather. Yes.

1006
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,990
在时光圈第一次惨遭洗劫之后
After the first attacks on loops...

1007
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,510
我们都更加善于隐藏和制造新的时光圈了
we all got better at hiding, making new loops,

1008
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,190
对我们的行踪保密
keeping our whereabouts secret.

1009
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:15,860
虚怪们日渐绝望
The Hollows grow more desperate every year...

1010
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:18,670
而巴伦想要帮助他的朋友们
and Barron wishes to help his friends.

1011
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,070
佩格林小姐  快来  艾沃赛特女士醒了
Miss Peregrine, come quickly. Miss Avocet's awake.

1012
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,430
突然间  我又飞进去了
And suddenly, I flew into it again...

1013
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,830
砰砰的两声  我什么都看不见了
Bang! Bang! I couldn't see anything.

1014
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,860
佩格林小姐  他们发现了我的新时光圈
Oh, Miss Peregrine. They found my new loop.

1015
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,910
孩子们  我想要救他们...
The children. I tried to save them...

1016
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,670
但是虚怪太多了
but there were so many Hollows.

1017
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,550
我不知道我是怎么逃出来的
I don't know how I escaped.

1018
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,220
你现在安全了
You're safe now.

1019
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,230
没人是安全的
None of us are safe.

1020
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,350
他们在我的时光圈放置了机器
They set up the machine in my loop.

1021
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,510
他们把它放在了黑池塔的地窖里
They put it in the cellars at Blackpool Tower.

1022
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:49,900
他们还在那里
They're still there.

1023
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,910
-他们的机器  -那个实验
- Their machine? - The experiment.

1024
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,510
他们想再做一次
They intend to do it again.

1025
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,750
这次  他要用更多时鸟
This time, he's using more Ymbrynes.

1026
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,790
他仍然想得到永生
He still wants to be immortal.

1027
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,790
虚怪们只攻击异能者吗
Do Hollows only attack peculiars?

1028
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,180
当然不是
Of course not.

1029
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,310
他们是怪兽  杰克
They're monsters, Jake.

1030
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,590
他们对挡路者毫不留情
They'll slaughter anything in their path.

1031
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:13,030
以前岛上有一些绵羊被杀了
Some sheep on the island were killed.

1032
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,790
你认为他们还没到这里吗
You don't think they're here already, do you?

1033
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,230
你见过白色眼睛的人吗
Have you seen anyone with white eyes?

1034
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,750
我很抱歉  孩子们  我们不能待在这里了
I'm sorry, children. We can't remain here.

1035
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:25,920
什么
What?

1036
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:28,280
我们明天搭第一班渡轮离开小岛
We'll leave on the first ferry off the island tomorrow.

1037
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,110
把重要物品打包
Pack anything of importance.

1038
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:31,950
然后吃点三明治  早点睡觉
Then it's sandwiches and early to bed.

1039
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:33,430
我们是要永远离开吗
Are we leaving for good?

1040
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,270
-我们什么时候回来  -不回来了
- When are we coming back? - Never.

1041
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,520
如果佩格林小姐明天晚上
If Miss Peregrine's not here

1042
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:37,990
不在这里重置时光圈
to reset the loop tomorrow night...

1043
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,160
这座房子就会被炸掉
the house gets bombed.

1044
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,460
可我们的房子
But our house.

1045
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:41,710
别哭
Don't cry.

1046
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:42,920
佩格林小姐会在别的地方
Miss Peregrine will find you

1047
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,400
给你们找一座漂亮的新房子
another lovely house, somewhere else.

1048
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,430
一旦这个时光圈关闭了  就都结束了
Once this loop closes, that's it.

1049
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,390
我没法回到自己的时代了
I can't get back to my own time.

1050
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:57,430
你在那边看起来并不是很开心
You didn't seem very happy there.

1051
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,950
我不能就这样走掉  我有家人
I can't just leave! I have a family!

1052
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:02,510
而且你觉得自己很平凡
And you felt ordinary.

1053
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:05,110
你无法改变任何事情
Like, nothing you do changes anything!

1054
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:06,870
现在你有机会做点可以
Now you have a chance to do something

1055
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,390
改变一切的事情
that changes everything!

1056
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:11,310
杰克  我们现在有危险
Jake, we're in danger.

1057
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,940
而你是唯一能看见虚怪的人
And you're the only one who can see the Hollows.

1058
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:17,150
是  我是能看到  但我不是我爷爷
Yeah, see them, sure. But I'm not my grandpa!

1059
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:20,350
我不是他  我不会战斗
I'm not, and I can't fight.

1060
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:22,110
我不会杀人
I can't kill somebody.

1061
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,550
我会留下来只有一个原因
There's only one reason that I'd stay here...

1062
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:29,720
拜托
Please.

1063
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,270
离开吧
Just go.

1064
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,360
杰克  你在这里
Jake? Jakey, there you are.

1065
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,550
感谢上帝
Thank God!

1066
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,950
当我听到他们找到一具尸体时我吓坏了
When I heard they found a body, I freaked.

1067
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,270
这附近有流浪狗吗
Are there stray dogs around here?

1068
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,120
你在说什么
What you talking about?

1069
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,190
就好像...
It's like...

1070
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,830
发现了一只受伤动物的时候
when they find an injured animal,

1071
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,990
它们会从最柔软的地方下口
they go for the soft parts first.

1072
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:45,070
同样的事情发生在我父亲身上
Same thing happened to my father.

1073
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,030
警察快来了
The police are on their way.

1074
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,430
爸爸  我得走了
Look, Dad. I've gotta go.

1075
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,670
什么  不  你不能走  杰克
What? No. You don't, Jake.

1076
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,480
如果这不是意外事故的话
If this wasn't an accident,

1077
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:55,800
那现在岛上就有个疯子
there's a lunatic on the island.

1078
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,840
我这辈子都在跟这岛上的每一个人打交道
I've known everyone on this island my whole life.

1079
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,870
除了你和他
Except you, and him.

1080
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,850
他在酒馆里坐了一下午了
And he's been in the pub all afternoon.

1081
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,790
我也是  我在睡觉
So have I. I was sleeping.

1082
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,640
那位盲人朋友呢
What about the blind fellow?

1083
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:09,140
我猜他看不见
I assumed he was blind.

1084
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:10,870
那位戴墨镜的先生
Gentleman with the dark glasses...

1085
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,030
跟我搭一班渡轮而来
arrived on the same ferry as me?

1086
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,070
我老是看到他在附近转悠
I kept seeing him around.

1087
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:16,830
杰克
Jake!

1088
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,630
杰克
Jake!

1089
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:22,430
杰克  等等
Jake! Wait!

1090
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,230
你儿子还好吗
Is your son all right?

1091
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:29,400
不好
No.

1092
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:32,790
他有心理健康问题
He has mental health issues.

1093
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:33,990
我走不动了
I can't go.

1094
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,460
让我去吧  我经常会跑个五公里
Let me. I run 5-Ks all the time.

1095
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,400
有人吗
Hello?

1096
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,070
有人吗
Hello?

1097
01:18:58,120 --> 01:18:59,430
是你吗  年轻人
Is that you, young man?

1098
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,510
你过来了
You came through...

1099
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,830
你是异能者吗
You're peculiar?

1100
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,100
是的
Oh, yes.

1101
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:11,030
我非常感激你
And I'm extremely grateful to you.

1102
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,220
最近很难找到时光圈了
Terribly hard to find loops these days.

1103
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,990
所以你从沙滩那儿一路跟过来是有目的的
So, you followed me from the beach on purpose?

1104
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:19,790
不是的
Oh, no.

1105
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,310
我跟踪你很久了
I've been following you much further than that.

1106
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,070
戈兰医生
Doctor Golan?

1107
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,660
有的时候
Sometimes.

1108
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,710
我觉得时机成熟
When it suits me.

1109
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:37,430
我掌握异能的水平
The breadth of my peculiarity...

1110
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,510
完全局限于我的想像力
is purely limited by my imagination.

1111
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,630
我唯一无法改变的东西
The only thing I can't change...

1112
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,310
就是我的眼睛
is my eyes.

1113
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,780
巴伦先生  你好吗
Mr. Barron. How do you do?

1114
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:03,270
我在你爷爷家见过你
I saw you at your grandfather's.

1115
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:05,190
我原本希望能从
I was hoping to get

1116
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:06,530
他那里得到佩格林小姐的地址
Miss Peregrine's address from him.

1117
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,350
但是  我的旅伴
But, alas, my traveling companion

1118
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:10,230
在我之前找到了他
got to him before I did.

1119
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:12,150
你也知道...
As you know...

1120
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:15,860
一只饥饿的虚怪是无法阻挡的
there's just no stopping a hungry Hollowgast!

1121
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:22,310
说起我的旅伴
Speaking of my traveling companion...

1122
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:24,910
他马上就到
he's coming.

1123
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,910
相信我
Believe me when I say to you...

1124
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,910
等他来了  你是不会想
you don't want to be here...

1125
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,110
留在这里的
when he arrives.

1126
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:37,630
那我们走吧
So, let's be on our way.

1127
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:39,790
请吧
Shall we?

1128
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:46,830
抱歉
Excuse me.

1129
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:52,790
等等我
Wait for me.

1130
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:58,490
我可不能忘了我们的日历
I mustn't forget our calendar.

1131
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,650
劳驾你到客厅把它拿来好吗
Could you fetch it from the parlor

1132
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:00,820
艾沃赛特女士
please, Miss Avocet?

1133
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:06,150
去帮帮其他人
Go and help the others.

1134
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:21,590
佩格林小姐  终于见到你了
Miss Peregrine, what a pleasure

1135
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:22,950
不胜荣幸
to meet you at last!

1136
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:26,030
我们能进来吗
May we come in?

1137
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:34,030
孩子们
Children!

1138
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:37,350
请你们移步到楼下来  好吗
Would you make your way down the stairs, please?

1139
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,270
在这座房子里由我发号施令  巴伦先生
I give the orders in this house, Mr. Barron.

1140
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:41,500
现在不是了
Not today.

1141
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,470
你应该清楚杰克已经没用了
You should know that Jake has served his purpose.

1142
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:47,350
如果你在乎他的小命  我建议
If you value his life, I suggest

1143
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,820
每个人都照我说的去做
everyone does as they're told.

1144
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,550
-孩子们  -安静
- Children! - Shush!

1145
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:55,350
没有人可以对我的孩子们下令
No one tells my children what to do!

1146
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,040
孩子们
Children...

1147
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,390
请下来
come down here, please.

1148
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:04,750
佩格林小姐
Miss Peregrine...

1149
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:06,670
我记得我说过让你安静
I thought I told you to be quiet.

1150
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:10,620
孩子们
Children...

1151
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,750
为了杰克的安危
for Jake's safety...

1152
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:15,380
我们要按照巴伦先生的要求去做
we're going to do what Mr. Barron asks.

1153
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,300
他希望带我一起回到
He wishes to take me with him

1154
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,870
他在黑池的集结地
to his rendezvous in Blackpool.

1155
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,630
因此  为了他的安全
So, for his protection...

1156
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,230
他想让我化成鸟的形态
he'd like me to assume bird form,

1157
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,750
最好关进笼子里
preferably caged.

1158
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,990
他想让你们进到一间能上锁的房间里去
He'd like you to make your way into a lockable room,

1159
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,510
比如说客厅
such as the parlor...

1160
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,310
他不会放了杰克
as he won't release Jake if he fears

1161
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,880
他担心一旦失去了筹码
an attack could be mounted upon him...

1162
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,630
自己就会遭受攻击
once he loses his leverage.

1163
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:34,590
我说的对吗  巴伦先生
Correct, Mr. Barron?

1164
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,960
你要牺牲自己和大家的生命
You're sacrificing yourself and all of us...

1165
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:39,990
去救杰克
for Jake?

1166
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:42,830
巴伦先生是和一只虚怪一起来的  伊诺克
Mr. Barron travels with a Hollow, Enoch.

1167
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,030
一旦它到了这里  我们都会死
Once it arrives here, we're all dead.

1168
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:50,790
伊诺克  只有杰克能看到它们
Enoch. Only Jake can see them.

1169
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,950
她是说他是我们唯一的希望
She means he's our only hope.

1170
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,110
能照顾你们
It's been my privilege...

1171
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,670
是我的荣幸
to care for you all.

1172
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:45,630
再见  我的孩子们
Goodbye, my children.

1173
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:56,560
现在  放了他
Now let him go.

1174
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:21,070
答应我一件事  杰克
Promise me one thing, Jake.

1175
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:27,070
答应我你会尽力照顾他们所有人
That you will try to look after them all.

1176
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,310
我答应你
I promise.

1177
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:09,800
天快黑了
It's getting dark.

1178
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:12,030
你们甚至连它们的影子都看不到
You won't even be able to see their shadows.

1179
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,260
我们必须留在室内
We have to stay inside.

1180
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,950
只有在室内我们才有希望
It's the only place we stand a chance.

1181
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,830
他说得对  谁知道
He's quite right. Now, where does

1182
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:18,430
佩格林小姐把武器放在哪儿了
Miss Peregrine keep her weapon?

1183
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:20,390
在那里  我们走
In there. Let's go.

1184
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:21,950
好了  孩子们
Now, all right, children.

1185
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,330
确认所有房门都锁上了
Make sure all the doors are locked,

1186
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,030
所有窗户都闩上了
and the windows are latched.

1187
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:27,470
所有入口都必须封死了  快
Everything must be sealed up tight. Now quickly.

1188
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,790
快  行动
Quickly! Go!

1189
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:40,470
给
Here.

1190
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:46,830
杰克  我想今晚最好由你来接电话
Jake, I think tonight, you better answer that.

1191
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
好
Okay.

1192
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:53,470
你好
Hello?

1193
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,770
你好  我是亚伯
Hello, this is Abe.

1194
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:55,910
你是哪位
Who's that?

1195
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:03,550
你还不认识我  我是杰克
You don't know me yet. I'm Jake.

1196
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,910
你是新来的  欢迎来到大家庭  杰克
Ah, you're new. Welcome to the family, Jake.

1197
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,510
我不能长聊
Now, I can't talk long...

1198
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:09,990
请转告佩格林小姐
so just tell Miss Peregrine...

1199
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:12,150
我在空军基地  我过得很好
I'm at the air base, and I'm fine.

1200
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:18,740
我只想说我很想你
I just wanted to say that I miss you...

1201
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,550
还有如果我让你失望了
and if I disappointed you...

1202
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:23,150
对不起
I'm sorry.

1203
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,910
你是世界上最好的爷爷
You're the best grandpa in the world.

1204
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:41,550
快点
Quickly.

1205
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,110
-菲奥娜  -好嘞
- Fiona. - Got it.

1206
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,240
艾沃赛特女士
Miss Avocet.

1207
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,140
好了  孩子们
Now, children.

1208
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:59,430
大家到齐了  我们定一些规矩
Now that you're all here, there's a few rules.

1209
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,950
安全第一
Your primary job is to stay safe.

1210
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:03,390
虚怪交给我
Leave the Hollow to me.

1211
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,390
我不想看到任何逞英雄的行为
I don't want to see any heroics.

1212
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:08,190
现在  拿着园艺工具的那些人
Now those of you with garden tools...

1213
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:10,510
我必须强调  你们要
I must insist that you...

1214
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:34,750
不要  伊诺克  回来
No, Enoch. Get back!

1215
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:02,190
走  到阁楼去
Go. Get to the attic!

1216
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:03,390
快走
Come on!

1217
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,320
接着她
Take her.

1218
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,390
走  出去
Go. Get out!

1219
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,600
奥利芙  快
Olive, come on!

1220
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:42,190
好
Okay.

1221
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:43,600
好了
All right, uh...

1222
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,590
糟糕  快要重置了
Crap! It's almost reset!

1223
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:52,660
菲奥娜  你能对那棵树做些什么吗
Fiona, is there anything you can do with that tree?

1224
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:54,510
-能  -当心
- Yes. - Be careful.

1225
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:59,230
我们得翻过那些窗户
We're going through the windows.

1226
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:00,540
我们走  快
Let's go! Quickly!

1227
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:25,860
走
Come on!

1228
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:38,150
克莱儿  下来
Claire, come on down.

1229
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:57,160
来
Come on!

1230
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:59,430
当心啊
Be careful.

1231
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:13,390
走  菲奥娜
Go, Fiona!

1232
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:22,140
我们走
Let's go!

1233
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:47,950
-那是不是  -时光圈关闭了
- Was that... - The loop closing.

1234
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:50,670
它没了
It's gone.

1235
01:30:55,670 --> 01:30:59,670
1943年9月3日

1236
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,140
抱歉  杰克
I'm sorry, Jake.

1237
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:15,670
现在我们怎么办
What do we do now?

1238
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,270
有巴伦和佩格林小姐的迹象吗
Is there any sign of Barron and Miss Peregrine?

1239
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:22,630
已经离开了  巴伦一定有条船
Gone. Barron must have had a boat.

1240
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,830
我们得追上他们
We have to go after them.

1241
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:31,110
他带她去黑池了
We know he's taking her to Blackpool.

1242
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,110
但是黑池离这里很远
But Blackpool is miles away.

1243
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:34,570
下一班渡轮还要很久才离港
The next ferry doesn't go for hours.

1244
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:35,820
我们赶不上的
We'll never make it in time.

1245
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,550
除非我们也坐船去
Not unless we go by boat, too.

1246
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:27,990
所以  在黑池有一个时光圈
So, there's a loop here in Blackpool.

1247
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:31,550
六个月前才刚出现  在2016年1月11日
It's only six months old. January 11th, 2016.

1248
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:34,510
艾沃赛特女士死了  它就无法被重设
With Miss Avocet gone, it can't be reset.

1249
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:36,470
时光圈也不会关闭吧
Won't the loop close?

1250
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:38,710
然后它就回到了现实时间
Then it's back to real time.

1251
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:43,030
杰克  你明白那意味着什么  对吧
Jake, you know what this means, don't you?

1252
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:44,860
你们会死去
You're gonna die.

1253
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,910
我不是指这个
That's not what I mean.

1254
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,390
我们得回到自己的时间里去
We have to get to our own time,

1255
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:49,560
但你不用
but you don't.

1256
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:53,670
你可以继续在2016年生活
You can continue to live in 2016.

1257
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,430
可我为什么要那样做呢
But why would I do that?

1258
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,190
如果我们杀了巴伦
If we kill Barron...

1259
01:33:57,400 --> 01:34:00,030
他就消失了  但时间会继续
he'll be gone, but time will carry on.

1260
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,550
他就去不了弗罗里达了
He won't go to Florida...

1261
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:07,180
亚伯也不会死  你就可以回家了
Abe won't die, and you can go home.

1262
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,070
我就能见到我爷爷了
I could see my grandpa.

1263
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:18,230
听着  我能对他们解释这一切
Listen, I can explain everything to them.

1264
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:21,350
能够说服他们带我去岛上
I can persuade them to take me to the island and...

1265
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,550
等等  你还会在这里吗
Wait, will you still be there?

1266
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:27,390
我们的旧时光圈永远消逝了
Our old loop's gone for good.

1267
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,350
我们不会再见面了
We wouldn't see each other again.

1268
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:34,230
我以为你希望我留下
I thought you wanted me to stay.

1269
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,190
我知道你会选择亚伯的
I know you'll choose Abe.

1270
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:42,750
如果我介意的话我就不会告诉你了
If I minded, I wouldn't have told you.

1271
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,230
你在地图上找到艾沃赛特女士的
So, have you found Miss Avocet's

1272
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:54,590
时光圈了吗
loop on the map yet?

1273
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:57,310
在这里  不过是新的
It's here. But it's new.

1274
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:59,940
她在今年早些时候制造的  是我所在的年份
She made it early this year. That's my year.

1275
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:01,560
如果我们不在时光圈关掉之前出去
If we don't get out before it closes,

1276
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:03,390
我们就会永远困在2016年1月
we're stuck in January 2016.

1277
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:04,510
好极了
Great.

1278
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:06,350
我们的时间都会走到头
Time catches up with all of us,

1279
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:08,270
除了你我们都会死  计划是什么
we all die, except you. Plan?

1280
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:10,470
时光圈会在四点半关闭
The loop closes at 4:30.

1281
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:11,870
意味着我们要进入时光圈
That means we need to get in,

1282
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:13,400
救了时鸟之后再出来
rescue the Ymbrynes and then get out.

1283
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:16,070
如果我们都还能活着的话
Yeah, if we're not already dead.

1284
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:18,000
艾沃赛特女士说机器
Miss Avocet said the machine is in the cellar

1285
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:19,290
在黑池塔大楼的地下室
of the Blackpool Tower building.

1286
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:22,070
这意味着我们会待在室内  和虚怪一起
That means we will be indoors... with Hollows.

1287
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:24,590
不会的  我有个计划
No, we won't. I've got a plan.

1288
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:26,270
但我需要你们的帮助
But I'm gonna need your help.

1289
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,510
不会是在这里吧
This can't be it, can it?

1290
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:01,070
时光圈的入口可能在任何地方
Loop entrances can be anywhere.

1291
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:03,350
伦敦的那个是在一个地铁隧道里
The one in London's in a subway tunnel.

1292
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:17,350
你确定就是这个地方吗
Are you sure this is it?

1293
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,190
我觉得是的
I think so.

1294
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:26,390
米勒德  你要先做一件事
Millard, there's something I need you to do first.

1295
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,860
好吧  我知道
All right. I know.

1296
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:34,750
快看  塔就在那儿  并不远
Look. There's the tower. It's not far.

1297
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:37,590
你说得轻巧  我快冻死了
Easy for you to say. I'm freezing.

1298
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:44,860
准备好了吗
Ready?

1299
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:58,180
所有通往地下室的门都锁住了
All of the doors to the cellar are locked.

1300
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:00,400
要找到时鸟只能从那里进去
The only way to reach the Ymbrynes is through there.

1301
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:02,350
那里是后台
It's backstage.

1302
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:04,550
你能看到多少只虚怪
How many Hollows can you see?

1303
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,350
就四只  还好
Four. That's good news.

1304
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,140
我觉得我们两个
I think you and I have

1305
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:10,910
对于还好的定义完全不同
a very different definition of good news.

1306
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:14,230
只有四只就说明巴伦其他的朋友们还没来
It means Barron's other friends haven't arrived yet.

1307
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,070
他们还没有开始实验
So they haven't started the experiment.

1308
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:18,390
我们来得还不算晚
We're not too late.

1309
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,240
艾玛
Okay, Emma.

1310
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,630
你准备好了吗  你知道要说什么
You ready? You know what to say.

1311
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:25,110
绳子在这儿  杰克
Here, Jake.

1312
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:31,030
我们的兄弟应该很快就会来了
Our brethren should be joining us momentarily.

1313
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:32,790
今天我们要
This is a day to...

1314
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:34,470
下面那个
You down there!

1315
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:37,060
我们杀了你的虚怪朋友  巴伦先生
We killed your Hollow friend, Mr. Barron.

1316
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:39,750
现在我们要来救佩格林小姐
And now we've come for Miss Peregrine.

1317
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,430
五分钟以内把她和
Bring her and all the other Ymbrynes

1318
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:43,590
其他所有时鸟带到码头
to the end of the pier in five minutes...

1319
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,470
不然后果自负
or face the consequences.

1320
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:51,190
这些小孩真是
These children must be

1321
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:53,310
和他们的校长一样疯狂
as insane as their headmistress.

1322
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:57,790
不过虚怪们肯定很高兴能饱餐一顿
Still, the Hollows will be glad of a feed.

1323
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:02,270
你们在哪儿
Where are you?

1324
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,790
我知道你们肯定在这里的某个地方
I know you're in here somewhere!

1325
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,910
很好  听我说
Good. Listen to me.

1326
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:14,950
我要你们跟着阿彻先生和克拉克先生
I want you to follow Mr. Archer and Mr. Clark.

1327
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:16,880
他们会带你们到码头
They're going to take you down to the pier...

1328
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,150
吃顿下午茶
for a little afternoon tea.

1329
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:22,990
阿彻先生  克拉克先生
Mr. Archer, Mr. Clark...

1330
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:25,190
把虚怪们召集过来  带它们去码头
gather the Hollows and take them to the pier.

1331
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:27,740
那些小孩把马尔萨斯杀了吗
Those children killed Malthus?

1332
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:29,310
自从马尔萨斯杀了亚伯·波特曼
Barron's had it in for Malthus

1333
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,150
巴伦就一直对马尔萨斯怀恨在心
ever since he killed Abe Portman.

1334
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:33,310
我跟踪了亚伯·波特曼几个月了
I tracked Abe Portman for months.

1335
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:36,990
我只需要几分钟
All I needed was a few minutes...

1336
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:40,030
就能从他那儿搞到佩格林小姐的时光圈的位置
to get the location of Miss Peregrine's loop from him.

1337
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:41,470
但是事与愿违
But no!

1338
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:43,510
马尔萨斯连几分钟都等不了
Malthus couldn't wait.

1339
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,140
结果
Instead...

1340
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:49,550
我不得不假扮成一个精神病医生
I had to masquerade as a psychiatrist...

1341
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:52,100
整整三个礼拜
for three weeks...

1342
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:53,670
在佛罗里达
in Florida!

1343
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:57,510
你去过佛罗里达吗
Have you ever been to Florida?

1344
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:04,390
我不是叫你们去召集虚怪吗
Did I not tell you to gather the Hollows?

1345
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:05,560
如果这是个陷阱怎么办
What if it's a trap?

1346
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:07,830
这当然是个陷阱  爱德华兹小姐  但又怎样
Of course, it is, Miss Edwards. But what of it?

1347
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:10,390
几个小孩对付四只虚怪
A couple of children against four Hollows.

1348
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,070
赶紧把这破事搞定
Let's get this over with.

1349
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:32,720
杰克  我卡住了
Jake, I'm stuck!

1350
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:40,240
快点
Hurry up!

1351
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:02,820
他们来了
They're coming!

1352
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:18,920
我们走
Let's go.

1353
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:28,870
伊诺克  就是现在
Enoch. Now!

1354
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:48,640
砸  快砸
Go! Now!

1355
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:02,940
可以看到它们了
Starting to see them now.

1356
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:06,960
进入第二阶段
Phase two.

1357
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:13,120
艾玛  上
Emma, go.

1358
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:18,790
别光站那儿  抓住他们
Don't just stand there. Get them!

1359
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,550
好的  干得漂亮伙计们  该第二步了
All right. Good job, guys. It's time for step two.

1360
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:10,110
救佩格林小姐
Save Miss Peregrine!

1361
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:11,790
这应该算第三步
That's sort of step three.

1362
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:13,590
首先我们要对付巴伦
First, we've got to deal with Barron.

1363
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:15,790
我们走
Come on.

1364
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:19,750
他们现在应该已经回来了
They should've been back by now.

1365
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:21,310
我说了这是个陷阱
I said it was a trap.

1366
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:22,950
如果真的是这样
If that's true...

1367
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:26,790
或许我们现在应该转移时鸟了
perhaps we should move the Ymbrynes now.

1368
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,310
你是认真的吗
You're not serious?

1369
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:30,780
我看着不像认真的样子吗
Do I not look serious?

1370
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:34,310
我看着不像是一个搜遍了整个地球
Do I not look like a man who has searched the globe...

1371
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:36,980
就为多吃一颗眼珠
looking for just one more eye to eat...

1372
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:39,940
希望吃了之后能重获人形
in hopes of regaining sufficient humanity...

1373
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:42,230
继续自己的研究的人吗
to return to his research?

1374
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:45,000
我花了这么多年来抓时鸟
A man who's spent years hunting Ymbrynes...

1375
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:47,990
就是为了今晚
in preparation for this night...

1376
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:50,950
在威尔士用了两天  不  是三天
and two, no, three days, in Wales...

1377
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:53,670
假装是在看鸟
pretending to look at birds!

1378
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,190
我向你们保证
I assure you...

1379
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,590
我不会放任我的命运
I will not stand idly by...

1380
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:02,150
于不顾的
to see my destiny derailed.

1381
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,150
休  上吧
Hugh, do it now!

1382
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:25,820
给我回来
Come back here!

1383
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,000
抓住他们
Get them!

1384
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:35,840
快走  趴下
Go. Get down!

1385
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:41,670
你觉得你能阻止我吗
You think you can stand in my way?

1386
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:46,030
你  杰克  满足于生老病死
You, Jake, content to age and die...

1387
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:49,950
好像你根本没有异能的天赋一样是吗
as if you had not the gift of peculiarity at all?

1388
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:58,550
我是更高等的生命
I am a higher being.

1389
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:01,870
我掌握了不死的秘诀
I hold the secret to eternal life!

1390
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:03,180
不好意思打断一下
Sorry to interrupt.

1391
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:05,190
什么
What the...

1392
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:17,520
布朗温
Bronwyn.

1393
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:25,230
你又射偏了  杰克
You missed me again, Jake.

1394
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:28,550
看来你的异能不是精确瞄准
I take it accuracy is not your peculiarity.

1395
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:42,350
亚伯就厉害多了
Abe was a much worthier adversary.

1396
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:47,750
不要让他到时鸟那儿去
Don't let him get to the birds.

1397
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:02,230
你务必把你的裁缝介绍给我认识一下
You must put me in contact with your tailor.

1398
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:07,950
时鸟  时鸟  我来啦
Ymbrynes, Ymbrynes! Here I come!

1399
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:21,380
冷吗
Cold?

1400
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:23,950
等到你浑身的血液都冻住吧
Wait till the blood freezes in your veins.

1401
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:30,680
你就打算这样救你朋友吗
That was your attempt to rescue your friend, was it?

1402
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,670
杰克
Jake.

1403
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:58,170
我会尽力拖住他的
I'll hold him off as long as I can.

1404
01:46:58,200 --> 01:46:59,630
你什么时候才能意识到
When are you going to realize

1405
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:01,430
你用那玩意的准头烂透了
you are a terrible shot with that thing.

1406
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:05,280
找到其他人  我会在时光圈入口和你们碰头的
Get the others. I'll meet you at the loop entrance.

1407
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:19,540
我救你出来
Let's get you out.

1408
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:50,030
最后
Eventually...

1409
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:52,660
你肯定会没气的
you're going to run out of breath.

1410
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:56,030
然后一切就会结束了
And it'll all be over!

1411
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:59,830
你深爱的杰克和佩格林小姐死路一条
Death for your beloved Jake and Miss Peregrine...

1412
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,230
而我则是永生
everlasting life for me!

1413
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,350
你会得到一块薄荷糖
And a mint for you.

1414
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:04,070
奥利芙
Olive.

1415
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:10,270
很抱歉  奥利芙
I'm so sorry, Olive.

1416
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,110
这些年我从来没有感谢过你
All these years, I never appreciated you.

1417
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:17,430
我不知道自己有多幸运
I didn't see how lucky I was.

1418
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:23,070
我太习惯有你的陪伴  我从来没有意识到
I got so used to having you there, I never realized...

1419
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,000
你从来没有意识到什么
You never realized what?

1420
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:24,470
找到你的孩子们  创建新的时光圈
Find your children. Create new loops.

1421
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:29,230
杰克
So, Jake...

1422
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:32,710
看来你继承了你爷爷的异能
I see you've inherited your grandfather's peculiarity.

1423
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:35,150
你跟他一样讨人厌
You're just as annoying as he was.

1424
01:50:38,240 --> 01:50:39,870
说到亚伯
Speaking of Abe...

1425
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:42,820
如果你在来生看到他
if you should see him in the afterlife...

1426
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:45,190
替我向他问好
give him my regards.

1427
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:56,070
拜托了  我们不能再冒险让他把你带走
Please. We can't risk him taking you again.

1428
01:51:15,120 --> 01:51:16,750
伊诺克  其他人在哪里
Enoch! Where are the others?

1429
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:18,850
他们都安全了  奥利芙正把他们带回幽灵列车
They're safe. Olive is leading them back to the Ghost Train.

1430
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:20,750
杰克需要我们  巴伦太强大了
Jake needs us. Barron's too strong.

1431
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:29,910
你已经失去佩格林小姐了
You've lost Miss Peregrine.

1432
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:32,470
你失去了一切  结束了
You've lost everything. It's over.

1433
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,110
杰克
Jake?

1434
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:52,620
杰克
Jake?

1435
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:57,750
杰克
Jake?

1436
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:05,630
艾玛
Emma?

1437
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:07,710
不  等等  看  那不是我  是巴伦
No, wait. Look. That's not me. It's Barron.

1438
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:08,800
别听他的
Don't listen to him.

1439
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:10,060
他是巴伦  不  我是杰克
He's Barron. No, I'm Jake.

1440
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:11,310
那是巴伦
That's Barron.

1441
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:13,470
我比杰克打得准
I've got a better shot than Jake.

1442
01:52:13,640 --> 01:52:15,320
没弄清谁是谁之前都不准动
So, neither of you move until we sort this.

1443
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:16,830
听我说  我是杰克
Listen to me. I'm Jake.

1444
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:19,750
我在佛罗里达州长大  我想成为探险家
I grew up in Florida and I wanted to be an explorer.

1445
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:22,280
我以为一切都不会改变  因为我很平凡
I thought nothing would ever change because I was ordinary.

1446
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:24,190
这是杰克  抓住巴伦
That's Jake. Get Barron.

1447
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:25,570
不  听着  我跟他说了所有的事
No. Look. I told him all of this.

1448
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:26,870
她曾经是我的心理咨询师
She was my psychiatrist.

1449
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:29,670
你解决他  我来找佩格林小姐
Look, you deal with him. I'll go find Miss Peregrine.

1450
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:39,160
等等
Wait.

1451
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:42,310
我能证明我是我
Look, I can prove that I'm me...

1452
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:45,030
因为我不平凡
because I'm not ordinary.

1453
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:49,830
我能做到别人做不到的事情
I can do something no one else can

1454
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:00,670
我能看到怪物
I can see the monsters.

1455
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:09,990
不  等等  是我
No, wait. It's me!

1456
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:28,270
伊诺克
Enoch!

1457
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:46,750
赶紧走  时光圈要关上了
We need to go. The loop is closing.

1458
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:49,080
对
Yeah.

1459
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:51,110
我们要走了
Those of us who are leaving.

1460
01:54:57,320 --> 01:54:58,320
艾玛
Emma.

1461
01:54:58,440 --> 01:54:59,630
你爱你的爷爷
You love your grandfather.

1462
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:01,630
不需要什么解释
There's nothing more to explain.

1463
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:05,270
不  我答应了佩格林小姐我会照顾你们的
No, I promised Miss Peregrine I'd look after you all.

1464
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:07,590
她现在受伤了  你们也没有了时光圈
And with her injured, and you without a loop...

1465
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:09,030
她会康复的
She'll recover.

1466
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:12,950
在那之前  我们会待在1943年
Until then, we'll be in 1943.

1467
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:15,900
我们一天天变老
We'll only age one day at a time.

1468
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:17,300
和普通人一样
Like normal people.

1469
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:19,430
那也不是件坏事
Which can be no bad thing.

1470
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:21,670
虚怪怎么办
What about the Hollows?

1471
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:24,270
只要它们还在  你们就不安全
As long as they're out there, you're not safe.

1472
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:28,030
我们不需要你给我们安全感  杰克
We don't need you to make us feel safe, Jake.

1473
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:31,510
因为你让我们感到勇敢
Because you made us feel brave.

1474
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,470
而那样更重要
And that's even better.

1475
01:56:36,440 --> 01:56:38,870
来吧  大伙儿  走吧
Come on, guys. Let's go.

1476
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:14,500
小老虎
Tygrysku.

1477
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:24,510
然后我们道别
And then we said goodbye...

1478
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:27,070
而时光圈关闭了
and the loop closed.

1479
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:31,150
我很害怕你不在这里
I was so scared that you wouldn't be here.

1480
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:34,830
我再也见不到你
That I'd never see you again.

1481
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:37,310
我很安全
I'm safe.

1482
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:43,430
我要把你的生日礼物给你
Let me give you your birthday present.

1483
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:46,400
爷爷  我的生日还有好几个月
Grandpa, my birthday isn't for months.

1484
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:53,310
你路上用
For your travels.

1485
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:56,030
去找她吧  杰克
Go to her, Jake.

1486
01:57:57,640 --> 01:57:59,310
你有地图
You have the map.

1487
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:02,470
你可以回到1943年
You can get back to 1943.

1488
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,630
不  即使是这样  他们坐着船
No. Even so, they took a boat.

1489
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:09,550
我不知道他们在哪里
I don't know where they are.

1490
01:58:11,680 --> 01:58:14,140
但你知道他们曾经在哪里
But you know where they were.

1491
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:56,870
你没法想象我花了多久才到这儿
You have no idea how long it took me to get here.

1492
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,030
离我最近的时光圈在加利福尼亚州的沙漠里
The closest loop was in the California desert.

1493
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,270
我用它到达了东京的时光圈
I used it to get to the Tokyo loop.

1494
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:19,910
然后带我到了离现在最近的1942年的时光圈
And that led me to the nearest loop back in 1942...

1495
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:22,190
我在那里加入了海军
where I wound up joining the Navy.

1496
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:23,870
别细问
Don't ask.

1497
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:25,950
然后我花了两个月在伦敦试图
Then I spent two months in London trying to...

1498
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:56,230
准备全速前进
Ready for full speed ahead!
