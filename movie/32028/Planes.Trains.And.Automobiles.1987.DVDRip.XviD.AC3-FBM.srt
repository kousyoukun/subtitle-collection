1
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:16,725
Uh...

2
00:01:16,817 --> 00:01:20,435
I gotta go. I gotta go.

3
00:01:22,114 --> 00:01:24,153
Gotta catch a plane.

4
00:02:06,864 --> 00:02:11,940
Two hours of staring at it to decide
to reconvene after the holidays?

5
00:02:12,035 --> 00:02:14,573
It's cosmetics, not curing cancer.

6
00:02:14,662 --> 00:02:18,991
- Aren't you going to the airport?
- To catch a six o'clock flight?

7
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:22,333
Go with me on the eight.
You'll never get a cab.

8
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,246
I said I'd be home by nine.

9
00:02:24,338 --> 00:02:26,496
That's you.

10
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,875
Oh, damn it, I left my gloves
in Brian's office.

11
00:02:29,968 --> 00:02:34,345
I don't need them. I get in the
elevator, taxi, plane and I'm home.

12
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:36,470
Would you pick them up for me?

13
00:02:36,558 --> 00:02:38,716
- Happy holiday.
- See you in Chicago, John.

14
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,304
You'll never make the six.

15
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:05,705
Taxi! Yo!

16
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,042
Taxi!

17
00:03:51,127 --> 00:03:52,621
Oof!

18
00:04:19,194 --> 00:04:21,151
Cab! Cab!

19
00:04:27,118 --> 00:04:28,826
Sir?

20
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:31,070
Sir? Sir? Excuse me.

21
00:04:31,163 --> 00:04:33,654
I'm desperately late for a plane.

22
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:37,449
Could I appeal to your good nature
and ask for your cab?

23
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:40,498
I don't have a good nature.
Excuse me.

24
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:44,538
- Come on!
- Could I offer you $10 for it?

25
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:47,635
- 20. I'll give you $20 for it.
- I'll take 50.

26
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,472
All right.

27
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:55,633
Anyone who would pay $50 for a cab
would certainly pay $75.

28
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,851
Not necessarily.

29
00:04:58,981 --> 00:05:02,100
All right, 75. You're a thief.

30
00:05:02,192 --> 00:05:03,983
Close. I'm an attorney.

31
00:05:06,446 --> 00:05:09,530
- Have a happy holiday.
- This will help.

32
00:05:16,122 --> 00:05:18,328
Hey! Hey! Hey!

33
00:05:18,415 --> 00:05:20,906
Hey, that's my cab! That's my cab!

34
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:23,373
Pull over! Pull over!

35
00:05:23,462 --> 00:05:25,371
All right. Pull over!

36
00:05:25,464 --> 00:05:27,752
That's my cab!

37
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:31,589
Pull over, buddy!
You're messing with the wrong guy!

38
00:05:37,892 --> 00:05:40,561
You son of a bitch!
This is my cab! Out!

39
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:02,032
Excuse me.

40
00:06:03,123 --> 00:06:04,582
Excuse me.

41
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,292
Excuse me.

42
00:06:09,963 --> 00:06:11,374
Excuse me.

43
00:06:14,092 --> 00:06:18,041
'Your attention, please.
Your attention, please.

44
00:06:18,137 --> 00:06:22,965
'Mid-Central flight 909
to Chicago O'Hare has been delayed.

45
00:06:23,058 --> 00:06:27,186
'For further information,
contact the ticket agent. '

46
00:06:27,271 --> 00:06:30,935
When are Grandma
and Grandpa coming?

47
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,313
They'll be here tomorrow, honey.

48
00:06:33,401 --> 00:06:37,814
Mom? Do you think Grandpa Walt
will give me a noogie?

49
00:06:37,905 --> 00:06:42,117
Of course he'll give you a noogie.
It means he loves you.

50
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:45,901
- Why don't I get noogies?
- Because you get Indian burns.

51
00:06:45,996 --> 00:06:48,321
But I prefer noogies.

52
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:53,168
Keep an eye on your brother.

53
00:06:54,337 --> 00:06:56,579
- Hello.
- Who is it?

54
00:06:56,673 --> 00:07:00,041
- Shh. Where are you?
- Who is it?

55
00:07:00,134 --> 00:07:01,712
Shh! It's Daddy.

56
00:07:01,802 --> 00:07:05,302
- Flight delay.
- When do you think you'll be in?

57
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:08,343
- Shouldn't be later than ten.
- I'll wait up for you.

58
00:07:44,008 --> 00:07:45,835
I know you, don't I?

59
00:07:45,926 --> 00:07:49,794
I'm usually good with names,
but I've forgotten yours.

60
00:07:49,888 --> 00:07:52,177
You stole my cab.

61
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:56,263
I've never stolen anything
in my life.

62
00:07:56,353 --> 00:07:59,472
I hailed a cab on Park Avenue
this afternoon.

63
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:02,648
And uh, before I could get in it,
you stole it.

64
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,522
You're the guy
who tried to get my cab.

65
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,488
I knew I knew you. Yeah!

66
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,899
You scared the bejesus out of me.

67
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:20,782
But it was awful easy
getting a cab during rush hour.

68
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,618
- Forget it.
- I can't forget it.

69
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:29,960
I am sorry.
I had no idea that was your cab.

70
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,885
Let me make it up to you somehow,
please?

71
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,128
How about a hot dog and a beer?

72
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:38,843
- Er, no, thanks.
- Just a hot dog, then?

73
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:41,886
I'm picky about what I eat.

74
00:08:41,978 --> 00:08:43,603
- Coffee?
- No.

75
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:45,313
- Milk?
- No.

76
00:08:45,398 --> 00:08:48,731
Soda? Some tea? Lifesavers? Slurpee?

77
00:08:48,818 --> 00:08:50,277
Sir, please.

78
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:53,362
Just let me know. I'm here.

79
00:08:53,447 --> 00:08:55,487
I knew I knew you.

80
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,280
Discuss this with the ticket agent.

81
00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:02,785
I couldn't,
I didn't know he put me in coach.

82
00:09:02,873 --> 00:09:07,368
- I'm sorry. First class is full.
- I have a first class ticket.

83
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,461
You have a coach seat assignment.

84
00:09:10,546 --> 00:09:12,918
- Hi, Larry.
- Hi, Liz.

85
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:18,670
- Here OK?
- Oh, here, there. Anywhere's fine.

86
00:09:18,762 --> 00:09:20,802
Pardon me.

87
00:09:24,226 --> 00:09:26,930
You'll get a refund
on the difference.

88
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,811
I don't want a refund,

89
00:09:28,897 --> 00:09:33,024
I want a seat in first class
where I was booked over a month ago.

90
00:09:33,109 --> 00:09:37,023
I've had just about enough of you.
Now take your seat.

91
00:09:37,112 --> 00:09:39,484
Oh, you've had about enough of me?

92
00:09:39,573 --> 00:09:43,191
You delay me, then you bump me.
What happens next?

93
00:09:43,285 --> 00:09:45,989
Is this a coincidence or what?

94
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:47,906
Have a seat.

95
00:10:08,183 --> 00:10:11,137
I didn't introduce myself.
Del Griffith.

96
00:10:11,227 --> 00:10:14,430
American Light and Fixture,
Sales Director,

97
00:10:14,522 --> 00:10:16,645
shower curtain ring division.

98
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:22,189
I sell shower curtain rings.
Best in the world.

99
00:10:25,782 --> 00:10:27,609
And you are?

100
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:29,527
Uh, Neal Page.

101
00:10:29,619 --> 00:10:31,861
Pleased to meet you, Neal Page.

102
00:10:33,164 --> 00:10:35,785
What do you do for a living,
Neal Page?

103
00:10:36,918 --> 00:10:40,666
- Marketing.
- Marketing? Super. Super. Fabulous.

104
00:10:40,754 --> 00:10:42,462
Isn't that nice?

105
00:10:42,548 --> 00:10:47,589
Look, I don't want to be rude, but
I'm not much of a conversationalist.

106
00:10:47,678 --> 00:10:50,927
I'd like to finish this article.
A friend wrote it, so...

107
00:10:51,014 --> 00:10:53,256
Don't let me stand in your way.

108
00:10:53,349 --> 00:10:57,477
The last thing I want to be
is an annoying blabbermouth.

109
00:10:59,897 --> 00:11:01,937
Nothing grinds my gears worse

110
00:11:02,024 --> 00:11:05,025
than some chowderhead
who can't shut up.

111
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,439
You catch me running off at the
mouth, give me a poke in the chops.

112
00:11:16,871 --> 00:11:18,531
Ohh!

113
00:11:18,623 --> 00:11:20,911
Ohh, that feels good.

114
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,997
Oh, God, I'm telling you,
my dogs are barking today.

115
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:26,914
Whew!

116
00:11:29,383 --> 00:11:32,586
Ohh!

117
00:11:32,677 --> 00:11:35,429
That feels better.

118
00:12:01,746 --> 00:12:05,957
Six bucks and my right nut
says we're not landing in Chicago.

119
00:12:24,016 --> 00:12:25,427
Hello?

120
00:12:25,518 --> 00:12:27,391
- 'Hi. '
- Where are you?

121
00:12:27,478 --> 00:12:32,353
- I'm in Wichita.
- 'Wichita, Kansas? What happened? '

122
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:35,358
We couldn't land in Chicago.

123
00:12:35,444 --> 00:12:39,311
I don't understand what Wichita has
to do with a snowstorm in Chicago?

124
00:12:39,406 --> 00:12:41,896
What's going on, Neal?

125
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:47,116
We took off from New York,
they closed Chicago, we landed here.

126
00:12:48,914 --> 00:12:50,741
Neal.

127
00:12:54,962 --> 00:12:57,038
Trouble on the home front?

128
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,416
I really don't think
that's your concern.

129
00:13:00,508 --> 00:13:02,667
The finest line a man will walk

130
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:06,094
is between success at work
and success at home.

131
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:10,012
I got a motto -
like your work, love your wife.

132
00:13:10,101 --> 00:13:12,140
Well, I'll remember that.

133
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:16,771
- What's the flight situation?
- Simple.

134
00:13:16,857 --> 00:13:20,023
There's no way
we'll get out of here tonight.

135
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,688
We'd have more luck playing
pickup sticks with our butt cheeks.

136
00:13:24,781 --> 00:13:26,690
We'll find out soon enough.

137
00:13:26,783 --> 00:13:31,160
By the time the airline
cancels this flight, which they will,

138
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:36,370
you'd have more of a chance finding
a three-legged ballerina than a room.

139
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:40,503
- I could be stuck in Wichita?
- You are stuck in Wichita.

140
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:47,050
'Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please? '

141
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:50,966
I'm sorry to announce
that we're cancelling flight 909

142
00:13:51,055 --> 00:13:53,344
due to severe weather in Chicago.

143
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:57,560
Hi. I was wondering
if you had any rooms available?

144
00:13:57,645 --> 00:13:59,684
Anything will do.

145
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:02,856
- 'I'm sorry. '
- Is there another motel...

146
00:14:09,697 --> 00:14:11,524
Neal.

147
00:14:11,616 --> 00:14:13,276
Hi.

148
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:15,159
Well...

149
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:18,244
Welcome to Wichita.

150
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:21,201
Did you book a room yet?

151
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,498
I, uh, couldn't get in anywhere.

152
00:14:23,585 --> 00:14:27,713
When we got in, you called home,
I called the Braidwood Inn.

153
00:14:27,797 --> 00:14:29,624
I missed that one.

154
00:14:29,716 --> 00:14:34,176
I got an idea. I know the manager,
I sold him some curtain rings.

155
00:14:34,262 --> 00:14:37,465
If you pick up the cab fare,
I'll get you a room.

156
00:14:37,556 --> 00:14:39,181
Uh...

157
00:14:45,564 --> 00:14:47,390
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Great.

158
00:14:47,482 --> 00:14:50,898
All right! Grab an end of this,
will you? Thanks.

159
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:57,733
- Is this your trunk?
- Yeah.

160
00:14:57,825 --> 00:15:00,909
You should try lugging this thing
around New York City!

161
00:15:11,921 --> 00:15:15,337
# Well, he takes you up

162
00:15:15,425 --> 00:15:18,924
# And he beats you down, yeah

163
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:22,629
# He plays around

164
00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:25,510
# And he spends your money... #

165
00:15:28,186 --> 00:15:30,226
Where the hell is the motel?

166
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:35,352
- Doobby, is it much farther?
- Not much.

167
00:15:35,443 --> 00:15:37,898
Why didn't you take the interstate?

168
00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:40,857
You said your friend
has never been here

169
00:15:40,948 --> 00:15:43,819
so I figured
he'd like to... look around.

170
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:47,907
- Ain't nothing on the interstate.
- It's night.

171
00:15:47,996 --> 00:15:53,500
I know, but he's proud of his town.
That's a damn rare thing these days.

172
00:16:06,138 --> 00:16:09,589
Take care of the luggage,
will you, Doobby?

173
00:16:09,683 --> 00:16:11,510
OK, Del.

174
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,810
Get off of me.

175
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:22,691
Stick with me.

176
00:16:34,456 --> 00:16:36,495
Evening, Gus.

177
00:16:39,502 --> 00:16:42,171
Del Griffith! How the hell are you?

178
00:16:42,255 --> 00:16:45,209
Still a million bucks shy
of a millionaire.

179
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:50,709
Gus, meet an old friend, Neal Page.
Neal, Gus Mooney.

180
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:52,429
Glad to meet you, Nick.

181
00:16:52,514 --> 00:16:56,381
Gus, I told my friend here
you'd fix him up with a room.

182
00:16:56,476 --> 00:16:58,932
You have a major credit card?

183
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,732
You still honour
those discount credit cards?

184
00:17:03,816 --> 00:17:07,399
I'll have to charge you for a double,
but it'll come out even.

185
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:11,614
There you go, saving money already.
We're a good team.

186
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:17,490
We were going to Chicago
and the storm brought us here.

187
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:21,078
I know. I have half your flight
booked in already.

188
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:26,242
Well, I guess you're all fixed,
so, uh... there you are.

189
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:29,006
- Last room in the complex.
- You mean sh-share?

190
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,464
Hey, easy on that. OK.

191
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:06,529
- Hell of a cab ride, wasn't it?
- Yeah, great cab ride.

192
00:18:06,624 --> 00:18:09,329
You don't see cabs like that
too often.

193
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,840
- Want to take a shower?
- No!

194
00:18:18,927 --> 00:18:21,050
I meant did you want to go first.

195
00:18:21,138 --> 00:18:23,593
You thought...

196
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:26,219
I wouldn't...
What do you think I am?

197
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:28,978
Gee, that's funny. That's funny.

198
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:55,415
Ah. Ah.

199
00:18:55,503 --> 00:18:58,373
Oh, come... Come on!

200
00:19:09,641 --> 00:19:11,514
Ah! Ouch, ouch, ouch!

201
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:14,595
Ah! Ah!

202
00:19:16,814 --> 00:19:21,725
'You don't have to be a rock'n'
roller to wear a pompadour... '

203
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,710
Excuse me.

204
00:20:34,052 --> 00:20:37,752
I'd switch pillows
but I'm allergic to sponge.

205
00:20:37,847 --> 00:20:40,303
I'd be sneezing all night with that.

206
00:20:40,391 --> 00:20:44,175
That's why I carry my own pillow.
It's hypoallergenic.

207
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:55,728
I had no idea
those beer cans would blow like that.

208
00:20:55,822 --> 00:21:00,282
You left them on a vibrating bed,
what did you think would happen?

209
00:21:00,368 --> 00:21:03,653
It's been a long day,
it just didn't occur to me.

210
00:21:04,914 --> 00:21:09,042
It didn't occur to you, so I
have to sleep in a puddle of beer.

211
00:21:09,126 --> 00:21:12,127
- You want to switch?
- I just want to sleep.

212
00:21:12,212 --> 00:21:14,703
Me, too. I am bushed.

213
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:17,963
- Good night.
- Good night.

214
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,825
'She's sleeping in our
house! I'll have to burn the sheets! '

215
00:21:49,914 --> 00:21:53,199
'What if the shoe
was on the other foot? '

216
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:55,165
'I'd go barefoot! '

217
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:10,466
Oh!

218
00:22:21,484 --> 00:22:25,612
'Traffic is resuming
at O'Hare field shortly. '

219
00:22:43,296 --> 00:22:44,707
Sorry.

220
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,144
Damn it!

221
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,437
- What? What?
- That's it!

222
00:23:04,524 --> 00:23:07,062
If I don't clear my sinuses
I'll snore.

223
00:23:08,111 --> 00:23:11,147
If your kid spills his milk,
do you slap him?

224
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:15,616
- What is that supposed to mean?
- You're not very tolerant.

225
00:23:15,701 --> 00:23:18,370
You've been under my skin
since New York,

226
00:23:18,454 --> 00:23:20,612
starting with ripping off my cab.

227
00:23:20,706 --> 00:23:25,451
- God, you're a tight-ass.
- Would you like a mouthful of teeth?

228
00:23:25,544 --> 00:23:29,126
Hostile, too.
Nice personality combination.

229
00:23:29,214 --> 00:23:31,336
That's borderline criminal.

230
00:23:31,424 --> 00:23:36,299
Screw you! You spill beer, you smoke,
you mess up the bathroom...

231
00:23:36,387 --> 00:23:41,891
Who let you stay? I even let you pay
so you didn't feel like an intruder.

232
00:23:41,975 --> 00:23:44,466
- Oh, I'm an intruder?
- Yes.

233
00:23:44,561 --> 00:23:47,052
I was having a perfectly nice trip!

234
00:23:47,147 --> 00:23:52,058
Who was it who talked my ear off on
the plane? Who was that? I'm curious.

235
00:23:52,151 --> 00:23:55,852
Who told you to book a room?
I did. From the goodness of my heart!

236
00:23:55,947 --> 00:23:59,113
You're an ungrateful jackass!
Go on, sleep in the lobby.

237
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,948
I hope you wake up so stiff
you can't even move.

238
00:24:03,036 --> 00:24:06,868
You're no saint.
You got a free cab, a free room.

239
00:24:06,957 --> 00:24:10,160
And someone who'll listen
to your boring stories.

240
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:12,458
Didn't you notice on the plane,

241
00:24:12,545 --> 00:24:15,748
eventually I started
reading the vomit bag?

242
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,425
Didn't that give you a clue, like
maybe this guy's not enjoying it?

243
00:24:21,512 --> 00:24:25,556
Everything is not an anecdote.
You have to discriminate.

244
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:30,516
You choose things that are funny
or mildly amusing or interesting.

245
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:34,055
You're a miracle.
Your stories have none of that.

246
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:36,900
They're not even
amusing accidentally.

247
00:24:38,194 --> 00:24:42,737
"Honey, I'd like you to meet Del,
he's got some amusing anecdotes. "

248
00:24:42,823 --> 00:24:46,986
"And here's a gun to blow your brains
out, you'll thank me for it!"

249
00:24:47,995 --> 00:24:51,778
I- I could tolerate
any... any insurance seminar.

250
00:24:51,873 --> 00:24:54,827
For days I could listen to them
go on and on

251
00:24:54,918 --> 00:24:56,791
with a big smile on my face.

252
00:24:56,878 --> 00:24:59,250
They'd say, "How can you stand it?"

253
00:24:59,338 --> 00:25:03,965
And I'd say, "I've been with
Del Griffith. I can take anything. "

254
00:25:05,052 --> 00:25:06,926
You know what they'd say?

255
00:25:07,012 --> 00:25:10,297
"I know what you mean.
The shower curtain ring guy. "

256
00:25:11,933 --> 00:25:15,384
It's like going on a date
with a Chatty Cathy doll.

257
00:25:15,478 --> 00:25:20,223
I expect you have a string on your
chest that I have to pull out.

258
00:25:20,316 --> 00:25:23,186
Except I wouldn't pull it out.
You would.

259
00:25:23,277 --> 00:25:24,771
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

260
00:25:26,405 --> 00:25:29,406
And when you're telling
these stories,

261
00:25:29,491 --> 00:25:31,982
here's a good idea... have a point.

262
00:25:32,077 --> 00:25:35,695
It makes it much more
interesting for the listener.

263
00:25:49,593 --> 00:25:51,502
You want to hurt me?

264
00:25:51,595 --> 00:25:54,430
Go ahead,
if it makes you feel better.

265
00:25:54,514 --> 00:25:56,306
I'm an easy target.

266
00:25:58,476 --> 00:26:02,141
Yeah, you're right, I talk too much.

267
00:26:03,064 --> 00:26:05,103
I also listen too much.

268
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:08,901
I could be a cold-hearted cynic
like you,

269
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:12,152
but I don't like
to hurt people's feelings.

270
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:17,030
Well, think what you want about me.
I'm not changing.

271
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:19,158
I like... I like me.

272
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:21,865
My wife likes me.

273
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:23,783
My customers like me.

274
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:27,706
Cos I'm the real article.
What you see is what you get.

275
00:28:16,312 --> 00:28:20,772
# I'm back in baby's arms

276
00:28:20,858 --> 00:28:25,187
# How I missed those lovin' arms

277
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:29,607
# I am back where I belong

278
00:28:29,699 --> 00:28:33,115
# Back in baby's arms

279
00:28:34,787 --> 00:28:38,156
# Don't know why we quarrelled

280
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:43,325
# We never did before

281
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,587
# Since we found out... #

282
00:28:46,673 --> 00:28:48,084
Del.

283
00:28:48,175 --> 00:28:50,132
Hmm? Hmm?

284
00:28:50,218 --> 00:28:52,258
Why did you kiss my ear?

285
00:28:54,597 --> 00:28:57,266
Why are you holding my hand?

286
00:28:58,643 --> 00:29:00,635
Where's your other hand?

287
00:29:00,728 --> 00:29:02,685
Between two pillows.

288
00:29:03,772 --> 00:29:06,808
Those aren't pillows!

289
00:29:18,995 --> 00:29:21,153
Grr! Whoo!

290
00:29:21,247 --> 00:29:23,156
Oof! Hoo!

291
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:27,666
- See that Bears game last week?
- Hell of a game.

292
00:29:27,753 --> 00:29:31,536
Bears got a great team this year.
They're gonna go all the way.

293
00:29:31,631 --> 00:29:33,458
Ohh, yeeoow!

294
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,392
Ohh...

295
00:29:59,657 --> 00:30:04,817
Take my socks out of the sink
if you're gonna brush your teeth.

296
00:30:10,334 --> 00:30:13,702
Where are you?
'I'm in Wichita. '

297
00:30:13,795 --> 00:30:18,789
- You're still at the airport?
- 'I'm at a motel with a guy I met. '

298
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:22,667
You shared a motel room
with a stranger? Are you crazy?

299
00:30:22,762 --> 00:30:24,422
'I'm getting there. '

300
00:30:24,513 --> 00:30:26,589
Did you call the airline?

301
00:30:26,682 --> 00:30:30,347
They said I have a good chance
of getting on standby.

302
00:30:30,436 --> 00:30:34,765
If they told you wolverines make
good pets would you believe them?

303
00:30:34,856 --> 00:30:38,806
I'm not spending Thanksgiving in
Wichita. I've got a family waiting.

304
00:30:38,902 --> 00:30:41,819
- I'll get home.
- Mm. Not by aeroplane.

305
00:30:41,905 --> 00:30:44,858
They got 18 hours
of air traffic backed up.

306
00:30:44,949 --> 00:30:49,160
Odds are we're gonna be having
our turkey roll right here...

307
00:30:50,162 --> 00:30:54,325
...if we wait for the flight.
- How else can we get home?

308
00:30:55,542 --> 00:30:58,911
Burt Dingman, my buddy,
works for the railroad.

309
00:30:59,004 --> 00:31:01,957
- Train?
- I sold them their curtain rings.

310
00:31:02,048 --> 00:31:04,337
He owes me a favour.

311
00:31:05,843 --> 00:31:10,137
I'll get that. I paid for
everything else. Why break precedent?

312
00:31:10,222 --> 00:31:12,049
I feel like a freeloader.

313
00:31:12,141 --> 00:31:16,055
- Get me on the train, we're square.
- You got it.

314
00:31:16,144 --> 00:31:18,220
That's the easy part.

315
00:31:22,442 --> 00:31:24,399
What?

316
00:31:24,485 --> 00:31:27,059
You know goddam well what.

317
00:31:28,156 --> 00:31:30,195
I'm sorry. I don't.

318
00:31:30,283 --> 00:31:32,524
I had over $700 in here.

319
00:31:33,827 --> 00:31:36,781
I didn't touch your dough.
I'm not a thief.

320
00:31:36,872 --> 00:31:39,244
You went into my stuff last night?

321
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:43,544
I didn't take your money
and I don't care for the accusation.

322
00:31:43,628 --> 00:31:47,246
I had over $700 and you
went into my wallet for pizza.

323
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,341
- Just maybe when you went in...
- Count it!

324
00:31:50,426 --> 00:31:53,961
- Like you'd keep it there.
- There's $263 in there.

325
00:31:54,054 --> 00:31:56,343
If there's more, then I'm a thief.

326
00:31:56,432 --> 00:31:59,551
Just count it. Count it!

327
00:31:59,643 --> 00:32:01,517
263, right?

328
00:32:04,564 --> 00:32:06,391
- Empty.
- What?

329
00:32:06,483 --> 00:32:08,309
Dry.

330
00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:15,908
- We were robbed.
- Do you think so

331
00:32:17,576 --> 00:32:19,699
You know, I've been thinking.

332
00:32:19,787 --> 00:32:23,120
What we're dealing with
is a small-time crook.

333
00:32:23,206 --> 00:32:27,251
He didn't take the credit cards,
so we charge our way home.

334
00:32:27,335 --> 00:32:30,953
- What plastic you carry?
- Visa and a gasoline card.

335
00:32:31,047 --> 00:32:34,996
And a Neiman-Marcus card in case
we want to buy a gift for someone.

336
00:32:35,092 --> 00:32:38,378
- What have you got?
- Chalmer's Big Man Shoppe,

337
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,926
a chain in the Pacific Northwest.

338
00:32:41,014 --> 00:32:43,801
Great stuff.
But it does us no good here.

339
00:32:43,892 --> 00:32:49,052
Never mind. Get me to the station
and I'll take care of everything.

340
00:32:49,147 --> 00:32:51,472
Gus's son's gonna pick us up.

341
00:32:55,778 --> 00:32:59,229
- This is not him, is it?
- Gee, I hope not.

342
00:33:34,606 --> 00:33:37,690
- Are you Gus's son?
- I'm Owen.

343
00:33:41,445 --> 00:33:45,145
- You the shower curtain fella?
- Yeah. Del Griffith.

344
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,067
How are you?

345
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:49,828
- This is Neal Page from Chicago.
- Hi.

346
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:52,402
Pleased to meet you both.

347
00:33:59,795 --> 00:34:02,832
I'm to drive you to Wichita
to catch a train?

348
00:34:02,923 --> 00:34:04,797
Yeah, we'd appreciate it.

349
00:34:04,884 --> 00:34:07,635
- Train don't run out of Wichita.
- Hm?

350
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:10,293
'Lessen you're a hog or cattle.

351
00:34:14,184 --> 00:34:17,599
People train
runs out of S-Stubbville.

352
00:34:17,687 --> 00:34:20,604
That'll be fine.
That'll be just fine.

353
00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:24,733
Leave it be.

354
00:34:24,819 --> 00:34:28,567
Get your lazy behind out
and put that trunk in the back.

355
00:34:28,655 --> 00:34:31,989
- Oh, no. We've got it.
- It's very heavy.

356
00:34:32,075 --> 00:34:36,867
She don't mind. She's short
and skinny, but she's strong.

357
00:34:38,498 --> 00:34:42,080
Her first baby... come out sideways.

358
00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:44,410
She didn't scream or nothing.

359
00:34:44,503 --> 00:34:46,579
Isn't that something?

360
00:34:46,672 --> 00:34:48,415
You're a real trouper.

361
00:34:48,507 --> 00:34:51,176
We've got it already. It's done.

362
00:34:54,763 --> 00:34:58,048
Stubbville's
a little further than Wichita.

363
00:34:58,141 --> 00:35:00,679
- How much further?
- 30 miles.

364
00:35:01,811 --> 00:35:03,519
Maybe 40.

365
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:08,599
No more than 45, though,
depending on which way he goes.

366
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:11,017
On the back roads it could be 70.

367
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:17,441
Give me the glove.

368
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:20,570
Ow! Just nipped the little part. Ooh!

369
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:23,117
Give him the goddam glove!

370
00:35:23,206 --> 00:35:25,079
Are we there yet?

371
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:27,870
No. A little way to go yet.

372
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:31,672
Beautiful country, though, isn't it?

373
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,958
What's the temperature?
One.

374
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:01,983
Thanks.

375
00:36:06,537 --> 00:36:08,744
They didn't have two together.

376
00:36:08,831 --> 00:36:11,832
You got to be kidding me.
Oh, I knew it.

377
00:36:11,917 --> 00:36:17,077
I... The secretary was new,
and I explained it. Oh... I'm sorry.

378
00:36:17,172 --> 00:36:21,300
- I think they're just full.
- It's the holidays, I guess.

379
00:36:21,384 --> 00:36:23,591
Hey, we're lucky we got a ticket.

380
00:36:23,678 --> 00:36:26,928
Yeah. So, if I don't see you again...

381
00:36:27,015 --> 00:36:30,466
Want to get together
for a drink in the bar car?

382
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,679
- I'm gonna get some sleep.
- You sure?

383
00:36:33,771 --> 00:36:36,522
Yeah. Anyway, it's been interesting.

384
00:36:36,607 --> 00:36:39,810
That's the understatement
of the year.

385
00:36:39,902 --> 00:36:41,941
And thanks for the ticket.

386
00:36:43,864 --> 00:36:48,406
Neal! I need your address. I got
to pay you back for this ticket.

387
00:36:48,493 --> 00:36:52,704
- Ticket's a gift.
- No, come on. What's the address?

388
00:36:52,788 --> 00:36:54,496
Del, it's a gift.

389
00:36:54,582 --> 00:36:56,373
Happy holidays.

390
00:36:57,459 --> 00:36:59,499
Same to you.

391
00:37:15,017 --> 00:37:18,303
Hi. Going home for Thanksgiving?

392
00:37:18,395 --> 00:37:20,352
- Yeah.
- Me, too.

393
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:22,478
Just gonna make it.

394
00:37:58,683 --> 00:38:00,177
What did you do here?

395
00:38:00,267 --> 00:38:02,556
Did he say he smelled smoke?

396
00:38:27,876 --> 00:38:30,711
You walk a mile and a half
to the highway,

397
00:38:30,796 --> 00:38:33,962
the trucks will take you
into Jefferson City.

398
00:39:21,968 --> 00:39:24,044
You're in a pretty lousy mood, huh?

399
00:39:24,136 --> 00:39:26,378
To say the least.

400
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:30,721
You ever travelled by bus before?

401
00:39:32,644 --> 00:39:38,065
Hm. Your mood's probably not
gonna improve much.

402
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:51,367
# Well, I got you in my sights

403
00:39:51,453 --> 00:39:54,240
# Just one of those nights with you

404
00:39:55,832 --> 00:39:57,492
# And if you wanna fool around

405
00:39:57,584 --> 00:39:59,623
# Well, let me pin you
to the ground... #

406
00:39:59,711 --> 00:40:02,118
Neal, Neal. Check that out.

407
00:40:02,213 --> 00:40:05,664
# All the little boys are into soul

408
00:40:05,758 --> 00:40:09,423
# And all the girls wanna rock'n'roll

409
00:40:09,512 --> 00:40:12,263
# We all wanna dance... #

410
00:40:12,348 --> 00:40:14,673
Beats a movie on a plane, huh?

411
00:40:22,232 --> 00:40:24,354
Why don't you take a picture

412
00:40:28,654 --> 00:40:30,647
You got busted.

413
00:40:33,242 --> 00:40:35,281
Oh, that was good.

414
00:40:38,205 --> 00:40:41,205
This is as good a time as any
to tell you,

415
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:43,960
our tickets are only good
to St Louis.

416
00:40:44,044 --> 00:40:49,120
St Louis to Chi-town is booked
tighter than Tom Thumb's ass.

417
00:40:53,636 --> 00:40:56,839
#... a glorious Thanksgiving day... #

418
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:58,757
All right!

419
00:40:59,641 --> 00:41:01,598
That was fun, wasn't it?

420
00:41:01,685 --> 00:41:05,813
All right. Who wants to sing a tune?
Who's got a song?

421
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:09,681
- I got one, uh...
- Neal Page has got one!

422
00:41:10,526 --> 00:41:13,397
# Three coins in a fountain

423
00:41:13,487 --> 00:41:15,314
# Each one seeking... #

424
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:17,564
You know this! #... Happiness

425
00:41:17,658 --> 00:41:20,612
# Thrown by three hopeful lovers... #
No?

426
00:41:23,205 --> 00:41:25,778
# Flintstones, meet the Flintstones

427
00:41:25,874 --> 00:41:29,077
# They're the modern
Stone Age family

428
00:41:29,168 --> 00:41:32,122
# From the town of Bedrock

429
00:41:32,213 --> 00:41:35,712
# They're a page right outta history

430
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,966
# When you're with the Flintstones

431
00:41:39,053 --> 00:41:41,425
# Have a yabba-dabba-do time

432
00:41:41,513 --> 00:41:43,173
# A yabba-do time

433
00:41:43,265 --> 00:41:46,384
- # You'll have a gay old time #
- Wilma!

434
00:41:48,061 --> 00:41:51,477
I'm with the
American Light and Fixture Company,

435
00:41:51,564 --> 00:41:55,562
jewellery division,
and I've got the deal of a lifetime.

436
00:41:55,651 --> 00:41:59,067
This is your Diane Sawyer
autographed earring.

437
00:41:59,154 --> 00:42:01,111
You ever watch 60 Minutes?

438
00:42:02,783 --> 00:42:04,111
Thanks.

439
00:42:04,201 --> 00:42:06,952
This is Czechoslovakian ivory.

440
00:42:07,037 --> 00:42:09,195
That's it. That's $5.

441
00:42:09,289 --> 00:42:10,617
Great.

442
00:42:10,707 --> 00:42:14,206
This is your
Walter Cronkite moon ring.

443
00:42:14,293 --> 00:42:15,538
Thank you.

444
00:42:15,628 --> 00:42:18,913
They are filled with helium
so they're light.

445
00:42:19,006 --> 00:42:20,584
Thank you.

446
00:42:20,674 --> 00:42:23,248
This is a Darryl Strawberry earring.

447
00:42:23,343 --> 00:42:25,087
All right!

448
00:42:25,178 --> 00:42:27,467
These are very special earrings.

449
00:42:27,556 --> 00:42:30,011
These were originally handcrafted

450
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,718
for the grand wizard of China
in the fourth century.

451
00:42:33,811 --> 00:42:38,023
These aren't the originals
but they are very good replicas.

452
00:42:38,107 --> 00:42:40,680
They're $5 a pair, two for $7.

453
00:42:40,776 --> 00:42:43,611
# Spring over the ground
like a hunting hound

454
00:42:43,696 --> 00:42:45,818
# For this is Thanksgiving day #

455
00:42:50,785 --> 00:42:55,910
I'm Marti Page, and I'm thankful my
dad's coming home for Thanksgiving.

456
00:43:02,797 --> 00:43:07,043
You know something?
It makes you look older, too.

457
00:43:07,134 --> 00:43:10,467
Not just a little bit.
You could pass for 18 or 19.

458
00:43:12,931 --> 00:43:14,970
Did you call the wife?

459
00:43:15,058 --> 00:43:17,097
No one was home.

460
00:43:17,185 --> 00:43:20,719
Probably at my daughter's
Thanksgiving Pageant.

461
00:43:20,813 --> 00:43:23,482
Ohh. You missed it?

462
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,809
I'm sorry. Those...

463
00:43:26,902 --> 00:43:29,571
those are the precious moments, too.

464
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:33,778
They don't come back again.

465
00:43:36,786 --> 00:43:40,914
- I spend too much time away.
- I haven't been home in years.

466
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:43,665
What, seriously?

467
00:43:44,794 --> 00:43:49,289
No, it's a figure of speech.
I'm on the road so much, you know.

468
00:43:49,381 --> 00:43:54,007
Oh, I called a friend at Eastern
Airlines. It doesn't look good.

469
00:43:54,094 --> 00:43:56,881
I know. I called all the airlines.

470
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:04,474
Well, at least we're sitting on over
100 beans from my brilliant idea.

471
00:44:04,562 --> 00:44:06,519
You're a terrific salesman.

472
00:44:07,648 --> 00:44:10,851
You know, uh, I've been thinking,
that, uh...

473
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:14,358
when we put our heads together,
we really...

474
00:44:14,446 --> 00:44:17,316
We've really gotten nowhere.
And, uh...

475
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:19,649
I think I'm holding you up.

476
00:44:19,743 --> 00:44:24,203
Oh, don't say that about yourself.
That's not true, Neal.

477
00:44:24,288 --> 00:44:28,120
No, I think we'll get
to where we're going a lot faster

478
00:44:28,209 --> 00:44:30,285
if, uh... we were alone.

479
00:44:30,377 --> 00:44:32,204
OK?

480
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:37,797
OK. I see.

481
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:48,926
I think I'll just take care of this
and get going.

482
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:53,099
I appreciate that.
It's harder for two people to travel.

483
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:56,144
- Sure it is.
- You've got reservations...

484
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,476
- I know.
- Thanks for the meal.

485
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:01,939
That's all right.
And I owe you some of this, too.

486
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,656
No, no, no, no.

487
00:45:03,741 --> 00:45:06,446
- This is your cut.
- Del, I told you...

488
00:45:06,536 --> 00:45:09,987
Take the money.
Buy your kids a chocolate turkey.

489
00:45:10,081 --> 00:45:12,369
I'm just gonna leave it there.

490
00:45:12,458 --> 00:45:15,743
Then leave it. If you want to, fine.
I'm done, OK?

491
00:45:15,836 --> 00:45:18,920
I've got to get going,
so if you'll excuse me,

492
00:45:19,006 --> 00:45:23,252
I got things to do, uh... so, uh...

493
00:45:25,386 --> 00:45:28,221
Good luck,
and I hope you get home soon.

494
00:45:28,306 --> 00:45:30,761
- I'll see you.
- Yeah, sure you will.

495
00:45:41,818 --> 00:45:45,021
It's a white Lincoln Town Car.
Space V-5.

496
00:46:01,837 --> 00:46:05,087
V-5... V-5.

497
00:46:07,634 --> 00:46:09,044
V-5.

498
00:46:22,648 --> 00:46:23,762
Hey!

499
00:46:23,857 --> 00:46:25,481
Hey! Hey! Hey!

500
00:46:27,694 --> 00:46:30,399
Hey! Hey! Hey!

501
00:46:30,488 --> 00:46:32,445
The car's not there!

502
00:46:32,532 --> 00:46:35,201
I need a ride back!

503
00:46:39,955 --> 00:46:42,742
Oh! Ah... You...!

504
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:49,504
God damn it, God damn it, God...

505
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:54,010
'You're messin' with the wrong guy! '

506
00:47:23,537 --> 00:47:25,079
Aah!

507
00:47:27,874 --> 00:47:29,417
Whoo!

508
00:47:40,052 --> 00:47:42,626
'You're messin' with the wrong guy! '

509
00:47:59,946 --> 00:48:04,488
Oh, Jean Marie,
you're a stitch.

510
00:48:04,575 --> 00:48:06,651
No. Mom's gonna do the turkey.

511
00:48:06,744 --> 00:48:11,073
Yeah. Dad wants Ambrosia,
so I guess we'll get marshmallows.

512
00:48:11,164 --> 00:48:14,663
I'll do the crescent rolls
and you do the cranberries.

513
00:48:14,751 --> 00:48:17,621
You know I can't cook.

514
00:48:19,881 --> 00:48:22,004
- Ahem.
- Yeah.

515
00:48:22,091 --> 00:48:26,552
I'll see you tomorrow, then.
Gobble gobble.

516
00:48:28,347 --> 00:48:30,174
Ohh... bye-bye.

517
00:48:36,396 --> 00:48:38,934
Welcome to Marathon.
May I help you?

518
00:48:39,023 --> 00:48:41,099
Yes.

519
00:48:41,192 --> 00:48:43,648
How may I help you?

520
00:48:43,736 --> 00:48:47,816
You can start by wiping
that fucking dumb-ass smile

521
00:48:47,907 --> 00:48:51,073
off your rosy fucking cheeks.

522
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,113
Then you can give me
a fucking automobile.

523
00:48:54,204 --> 00:49:00,242
A fucking Datsun, a fucking Toyota,
a fucking Mustang, a fucking Buick.

524
00:49:00,335 --> 00:49:03,335
I don't care for the way
you're speaking to me.

525
00:49:03,421 --> 00:49:08,129
I don't care for the way your company
left me in the middle of nowhere

526
00:49:08,217 --> 00:49:11,752
with fucking keys to a fucking car
that isn't fucking there.

527
00:49:11,845 --> 00:49:16,222
And I really didn't care to fucking
walk down a fucking highway

528
00:49:16,308 --> 00:49:18,217
and across a fucking runway

529
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:21,928
to get back here to have you
smile in my fucking face.

530
00:49:22,021 --> 00:49:29,233
I want a fucking car
right fucking now.

531
00:49:32,323 --> 00:49:35,027
May I see your rental agreement?

532
00:49:35,117 --> 00:49:37,690
I threw it away.

533
00:49:37,786 --> 00:49:40,455
Oh, boy.

534
00:49:41,581 --> 00:49:44,701
- Oh, boy, what?
- You're fucked.

535
00:50:04,102 --> 00:50:06,557
'You're messin' with the wrong guy! '

536
00:50:06,646 --> 00:50:09,849
OK, 86, wake up.
You're gonna block the line.

537
00:50:09,941 --> 00:50:12,514
- Yeah, where you going?
- Chicago.

538
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,733
- Chicago?
- Chicago.

539
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:16,777
You know you're in St Louis?

540
00:50:16,864 --> 00:50:19,189
Yes, I do.

541
00:50:19,283 --> 00:50:23,825
Try the airlines, they're faster
and you get a free meal.

542
00:50:23,912 --> 00:50:27,744
If I wanted a joke
I'd watch you take a leak.

543
00:50:29,542 --> 00:50:33,705
Are you gonna stand there
like a slab of meat with mittens?

544
00:50:47,267 --> 00:50:51,679
What are you doing? I almost
crushed your head like a melon.

545
00:50:51,771 --> 00:50:53,680
Del?

546
00:50:53,773 --> 00:50:57,188
- Get your car out of here!
- Just a minute, OK?

547
00:50:57,276 --> 00:50:59,269
Get it out of here!

548
00:51:00,404 --> 00:51:04,401
What is your problem?
You insensitive asshole!

549
00:51:04,491 --> 00:51:07,243
Can't you see we've got
an injured man here?

550
00:51:07,327 --> 00:51:11,159
Now, I'll move my car
but you help him up.

551
00:51:11,247 --> 00:51:13,619
- No!
- My pleasure.

552
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:32,133
I had a feeling
that when we parted ways,

553
00:51:32,225 --> 00:51:35,475
somehow, someday,
our paths would cross again.

554
00:51:35,561 --> 00:51:37,388
Are you all right?

555
00:51:39,065 --> 00:51:42,683
I've never seen a guy
get picked up by his testicles.

556
00:51:42,776 --> 00:51:45,267
Lucky that cop passed by when he did

557
00:51:45,362 --> 00:51:48,861
or you'd be lifting your schnutz
to tie your shoes.

558
00:51:48,949 --> 00:51:52,068
I'm sorry,
that's terrible.

559
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,829
You know, I'm glad I didn't kill you.

560
00:51:54,913 --> 00:51:57,664
I wish you had.

561
00:51:57,749 --> 00:52:02,327
Oh, you don't mean that.
Remember, go with the flow.

562
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:05,788
How, when the rental agency
leaves me keys

563
00:52:05,881 --> 00:52:07,708
to a car that isn't there,

564
00:52:07,799 --> 00:52:12,544
then I hike three miles back to find
out they don't have any more cars?

565
00:52:12,637 --> 00:52:15,555
I got a car, no sweat at all.

566
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,388
- Well, Del, you're a charmed man.
- Nope.

567
00:52:19,477 --> 00:52:22,513
Oh, I know.
You just go with the flow.

568
00:52:22,605 --> 00:52:27,101
Like a twig on the shoulders
of a mighty stream.

569
00:52:27,192 --> 00:52:30,691
# Pulled out of Pittsburgh
rollin' down the eastern seaboard

570
00:52:30,779 --> 00:52:36,365
# I got my diesel wound up
she's runnin' like never before

571
00:52:38,161 --> 00:52:40,865
# There's a speed zone ahead,
all right

572
00:52:40,955 --> 00:52:43,707
# But I ain't seen a cop all night

573
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,542
# Six days on the road and I'm
gonna make it home tonight... #

574
00:53:01,474 --> 00:53:04,143
Please stop doing that with the seat.

575
00:53:04,227 --> 00:53:07,393
Start screwing with these
and you never get comfortable.

576
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:11,097
- Quit screwing with it.
- I gotta get comfortable.

577
00:53:11,191 --> 00:53:16,861
Do you have a bad back? I do, and
there's only a couple good positions.

578
00:53:16,947 --> 00:53:18,489
You'll break it.

579
00:53:18,573 --> 00:53:20,566
Ahh.

580
00:53:20,658 --> 00:53:22,366
Done.

581
00:53:22,452 --> 00:53:24,278
Ah, lovely.

582
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:26,244
Lovely, lovely.

583
00:53:33,086 --> 00:53:35,756
- Oh, damn it.
- What now?

584
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:39,208
I can't reach my feet
to get my shoes off.

585
00:53:39,301 --> 00:53:42,171
That's fine.
Leave your shoes on.

586
00:53:42,262 --> 00:53:44,384
I can't relax that way.

587
00:53:44,472 --> 00:53:48,137
I don't care to breathe
your foot odour.

588
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:52,009
It must be swell to be so perfect
and odour-free.

589
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:56,564
There's things about you that bother
me but I don't bring them up.

590
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,477
- Really?
- That's right.

591
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,608
- What?
- Lots of things.

592
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:03,447
- Name one.
- You want me to name one?

593
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:05,358
- Yeah.
- Fine, er...

594
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:08,616
You play with your balls a lot. Mm.

595
00:54:12,623 --> 00:54:15,992
I do not play with my balls.

596
00:54:16,084 --> 00:54:20,912
Larry Bird doesn't
do as much ball handling as you.

597
00:54:21,006 --> 00:54:26,545
- Are you trying to start a fight?
- No, I'm stating a fact, that's all.

598
00:54:26,636 --> 00:54:31,796
- You know what'd make me happy?
- More balls and extra fingers?

599
00:54:31,891 --> 00:54:35,888
Oh, that's... that's...
that's real humour!

600
00:54:35,978 --> 00:54:38,516
It would make me happy
if you shut up.

601
00:54:38,605 --> 00:54:41,641
- My pleasure.
- I like silence when I drive.

602
00:54:41,733 --> 00:54:43,607
- No problem.
- Thank you.

603
00:54:43,693 --> 00:54:45,318
You're welcome.

604
00:54:49,991 --> 00:54:51,817
You broke the seat.

605
00:54:51,909 --> 00:54:54,910
You broke the damn seat.
I don't believe it.

606
00:54:54,995 --> 00:54:57,237
It wasn't broken when I got out.

607
00:54:57,331 --> 00:55:01,494
- You messed around and broke it.
- It's impossible to break.

608
00:55:01,585 --> 00:55:02,699
Impossible?

609
00:55:02,794 --> 00:55:05,581
- Wanna drive?
- No. Why did you do this?

610
00:55:07,799 --> 00:55:11,583
I won't be held responsible
for faulty engineering.

611
00:55:11,677 --> 00:55:15,675
Well, this is comfortable.
This is really comfortable.

612
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,511
I don't want to argue.
Let's not fight.

613
00:55:19,601 --> 00:55:21,226
All right, all right.

614
00:55:21,311 --> 00:55:24,478
- I'm gonna go to sleep.
- All right.

615
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:29,519
My wallet's in the glove compartment.
Don't let me forget it.

616
00:55:29,611 --> 00:55:31,021
All right.

617
00:55:40,371 --> 00:55:42,826
# Ah, you can talk about the pit

618
00:55:42,915 --> 00:55:44,373
# Barbecue

619
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:46,284
# The band was jumpin'

620
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:48,701
# The people, too, I mess around

621
00:55:50,004 --> 00:55:51,831
# They're doin' the mess around

622
00:55:53,007 --> 00:55:55,463
# They're doin' the mess around

623
00:55:55,551 --> 00:55:57,876
# Everybody doin' the mess around

624
00:56:00,055 --> 00:56:03,341
# Now-ow, when I say stop
don't you move a peg

625
00:56:03,434 --> 00:56:06,351
# When I say go just shake your leg

626
00:56:06,436 --> 00:56:08,014
# And do the mess around

627
00:56:08,897 --> 00:56:11,518
# I declare, do the mess around

628
00:56:11,608 --> 00:56:13,517
# Now, let me have it there, boy

629
00:56:27,539 --> 00:56:29,247
# Now you got it, boy

630
00:56:30,417 --> 00:56:32,990
# Yeah! Go on, mess around!

631
00:56:37,048 --> 00:56:40,915
# Now this band's gonna play
from nine to one

632
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:43,845
# Everybody here's
gonna have some fun

633
00:56:43,929 --> 00:56:45,969
# Doin' the mess around

634
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:49,013
# They're doin' the mess around

635
00:56:49,101 --> 00:56:51,010
# Everybody do the mess around #

636
00:56:55,565 --> 00:56:59,265
'That was Ray Charles,
"Doin' The Mess Around".

637
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,978
'Looking outside,
the weather's clearing... '

638
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:14,448
Whew.

639
00:57:45,903 --> 00:57:47,528
Oh, come on.

640
00:57:54,119 --> 00:57:56,277
All right.

641
00:58:06,964 --> 00:58:09,122
Ohh, shit!

642
00:58:15,681 --> 00:58:17,839
Ohh... Oh.

643
00:58:24,731 --> 00:58:26,474
There you go.

644
00:58:28,276 --> 00:58:31,276
Think it out. Just relax.

645
00:58:32,238 --> 00:58:34,444
Let go! Let go!

646
00:59:02,057 --> 00:59:03,883
What's happening?

647
00:59:03,975 --> 00:59:06,892
Oh, w-we almost hit a deer.
That's all.

648
00:59:07,854 --> 00:59:09,478
Are you all right?

649
00:59:10,606 --> 00:59:12,646
Yes, I'm fine. Yes, I'm fine.

650
00:59:12,733 --> 00:59:15,224
It's awful hot. Take your parka off.

651
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:16,315
Yes. Yes, I will.

652
00:59:47,015 --> 00:59:52,519
There's a guy on the wrong side
of the highway. He'll kill somebody!

653
00:59:52,603 --> 00:59:55,225
Oh, my God!

654
00:59:55,314 --> 00:59:58,019
Hey! Hey!

655
01:00:01,278 --> 01:00:03,105
Hey, what's going on?

656
01:00:03,196 --> 01:00:05,189
Some joker wants to race.

657
01:00:06,449 --> 01:00:10,150
- Turn around!
- Don't race. That's ridiculous.

658
01:00:10,245 --> 01:00:12,818
All right, come on. Let's go.

659
01:00:12,914 --> 01:00:14,657
Put your window down!

660
01:00:14,749 --> 01:00:18,164
- He wants something.
- He's probably drunk.

661
01:00:18,252 --> 01:00:20,659
You're going the wrong way!

662
01:00:20,754 --> 01:00:24,799
- What?
- You're going the wrong way!

663
01:00:26,885 --> 01:00:30,503
- He says we're going the wrong way.
- Oh, he's drunk.

664
01:00:30,597 --> 01:00:33,052
How would he know where we're going?

665
01:00:33,141 --> 01:00:35,180
Yeah, how would he know?

666
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:38,766
Thank you. Thanks a lot. Terrific.

667
01:00:38,854 --> 01:00:40,811
Thank you.

668
01:00:40,898 --> 01:00:43,353
What a moron.

669
01:00:45,277 --> 01:00:47,850
You're going in the wrong direction!

670
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:55,534
You're going to kill somebody!

671
01:01:03,919 --> 01:01:06,077
You're going the wrong way!

672
01:01:10,926 --> 01:01:13,251
- Truck. Truck.
- What?

673
01:02:15,944 --> 01:02:17,983
Well, this isn't so bad.

674
01:02:19,114 --> 01:02:22,363
I thought it'd be
a lot worse than this.

675
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:24,692
They'll be able to buff this out.

676
01:02:24,785 --> 01:02:26,612
Oh, yeah.

677
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:30,700
Wow!

678
01:02:33,335 --> 01:02:35,374
I mean, that was close.

679
01:02:35,462 --> 01:02:39,162
We can laugh about it now.
We're all right.

680
01:02:39,257 --> 01:02:41,415
The whole, uh...

681
01:02:43,303 --> 01:02:48,011
Maybe we should get my stuff off
the road? What do you think? Yeah.

682
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:50,008
Yeah, that's a good idea.

683
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:53,891
Oh, my back!

684
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:57,348
Ohh! God.

685
01:03:18,001 --> 01:03:19,958
Come on. Here we go.

686
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:22,498
Thanks.

687
01:03:22,589 --> 01:03:24,961
Put it down for a second.

688
01:03:31,097 --> 01:03:33,718
Whew. What a night.

689
01:04:27,148 --> 01:04:28,559
What?

690
01:04:28,942 --> 01:04:30,352
What?

691
01:04:31,319 --> 01:04:33,726
You finally did it to yourself.

692
01:04:33,821 --> 01:04:35,232
Huh?

693
01:04:37,908 --> 01:04:41,692
I mean, good luck
turning the car in.

694
01:04:41,787 --> 01:04:44,871
They'll be happy as pigs in shit
to see you.

695
01:04:55,049 --> 01:04:59,093
How could you rent the thing anyway
without a credit card?

696
01:04:59,178 --> 01:05:02,048
You couldn't. How could you do it?

697
01:05:02,139 --> 01:05:06,599
I gave this gal behind the counter
a set of shower curtain rings.

698
01:05:14,901 --> 01:05:18,519
You can't rent a car
with shower curtain rings.

699
01:05:28,288 --> 01:05:30,411
Well, uh...

700
01:05:30,498 --> 01:05:32,574
somehow your, uh...

701
01:05:32,667 --> 01:05:36,878
Diner's Club card
wound up in my wallet,

702
01:05:36,963 --> 01:05:39,880
- and I, uh, just...
- You stole it!

703
01:05:39,966 --> 01:05:42,373
- Not exactly.
- You stole my card!

704
01:05:42,468 --> 01:05:44,092
I didn't!

705
01:05:44,178 --> 01:05:47,344
You stole my card,
rented a car and burned it!

706
01:05:47,431 --> 01:05:51,179
I found it in my wallet!
I thought you put it there.

707
01:05:52,185 --> 01:05:54,225
Why would I put it there?!

708
01:05:54,312 --> 01:05:58,012
- Kindness?
- Kindness?

709
01:05:58,107 --> 01:06:01,274
Kindness? You stole it!

710
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,187
He stole it!

711
01:06:03,279 --> 01:06:06,232
No, I was going
to send it back to you

712
01:06:06,323 --> 01:06:09,443
with whatever
the rental car charge was.

713
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:13,235
You didn't give me your address!
You just ditched me.

714
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:15,821
I had no money, no cards, nothing.

715
01:06:15,915 --> 01:06:17,955
- Give it back!
- I can't!

716
01:06:19,502 --> 01:06:21,080
Why not?

717
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:22,581
Because!

718
01:06:23,464 --> 01:06:25,088
Because why?

719
01:06:25,174 --> 01:06:29,752
Because when we stopped to gas up
I put the card back in your wallet.

720
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:44,771
Are you mad at me?

721
01:07:00,081 --> 01:07:03,165
You could've killed me,
slugging me in the gut.

722
01:07:05,503 --> 01:07:07,542
That's how Houdini died.

723
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,633
Ow. Ah!

724
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:22,301
One good thing - with all this
fresh air, we'll sleep like babies.

725
01:07:22,393 --> 01:07:25,264
Neal? Hey, hey, Neal, wait up.

726
01:07:27,148 --> 01:07:29,105
I need one room.

727
01:07:29,191 --> 01:07:32,560
If you're pissed,
we should get separate rooms.

728
01:07:32,653 --> 01:07:35,607
- Get your own room.
- I need a credit card.

729
01:07:35,697 --> 01:07:37,856
All right. All right.

730
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:42,487
I have, uh...

731
01:07:43,288 --> 01:07:44,912
Diner's...

732
01:07:46,791 --> 01:07:50,919
Visa... and a gasoline card.

733
01:07:51,003 --> 01:07:55,499
Uh... these aren't...

734
01:07:55,591 --> 01:07:57,334
uh, credit cards.

735
01:07:58,593 --> 01:08:02,128
- All right. I'll pay cash. Cash.
- 42.50.

736
01:08:09,729 --> 01:08:12,932
How about... $17?

737
01:08:14,316 --> 01:08:16,225
I can't do that.

738
01:08:16,318 --> 01:08:19,354
Please. Have mercy.

739
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:23,939
I've been wearing
the same underwear since Tuesday.

740
01:08:24,034 --> 01:08:26,359
I can vouch for that.

741
01:08:28,538 --> 01:08:30,945
I don't... I don't own the place.

742
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:41,878
$17 and a hell of a nice watch.

743
01:08:50,224 --> 01:08:52,264
Ouch.

744
01:08:56,856 --> 01:08:59,263
Um, would you like a room?

745
01:09:05,822 --> 01:09:10,567
I got a slight problem here.
I don't have the 42.50.

746
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:14,111
You have $17 and a good watch?

747
01:09:15,248 --> 01:09:17,287
No, I don't. I have, uh...

748
01:09:20,544 --> 01:09:22,999
I have $2 and, uh...

749
01:09:25,716 --> 01:09:27,542
and a Casio.

750
01:09:30,053 --> 01:09:33,635
Mm. I'm going to have to say
good night, so...

751
01:10:22,393 --> 01:10:26,936
Well, Marie, once again,
my dear, you were as right as rain.

752
01:10:29,399 --> 01:10:32,898
I am, without a doubt,
the biggest pain in the butt

753
01:10:32,986 --> 01:10:35,025
that ever came down the pike.

754
01:10:36,823 --> 01:10:41,781
I meet someone whose company
I really enjoy, and what do I do?

755
01:10:43,329 --> 01:10:45,368
I go overboard.

756
01:10:45,456 --> 01:10:47,532
I smother the poor soul.

757
01:10:47,624 --> 01:10:50,910
I cause him more trouble
than he has a right to.

758
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:55,669
God, I got a big mouth.

759
01:11:02,221 --> 01:11:04,261
When am I ever gonna wake up?

760
01:11:23,699 --> 01:11:26,902
I wish you were here with me
right now.

761
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:34,740
But I guess...
that's not gonna happen.

762
01:11:36,419 --> 01:11:38,910
Not now, anyway.

763
01:11:40,924 --> 01:11:44,624
What did I do to get hooked up
with this guy?

764
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:05,564
You're gonna
freeze to death out there.

765
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:14,617
- How's your drink?
- It's good.

766
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:18,121
Go for another one?

767
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:20,035
Where you been?

768
01:12:20,126 --> 01:12:22,700
Ever been to Italy? You had Amaretto?

769
01:12:22,796 --> 01:12:27,338
Yeah. This is a gin.
Is there a tequila there?

770
01:12:27,425 --> 01:12:29,667
Ahem. A little Mexican trip.

771
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,631
- Tequila?
- Here you go. Coming up.

772
01:12:32,721 --> 01:12:35,177
Is this a good combo or what?

773
01:12:35,265 --> 01:12:37,258
No. Probably not.

774
01:12:38,101 --> 01:12:41,470
Me, I'm going back to, uh, Jamaica.

775
01:12:42,606 --> 01:12:46,733
Jamaica, man. Have some rum, man.

776
01:12:46,818 --> 01:12:49,984
Dig it. Iree, iree, man.

777
01:12:52,448 --> 01:12:54,487
Oh, shit.

778
01:12:58,078 --> 01:13:02,870
You know, when I'm dead and buried,
all I'll have to prove I was here

779
01:13:02,958 --> 01:13:06,658
was some shower curtain rings
that didn't fall down.

780
01:13:06,753 --> 01:13:08,377
Great legacy, huh?

781
01:13:08,463 --> 01:13:12,460
At the very least,
at the absolute minimum,

782
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:16,084
you've got a woman you love
to grow old with, right?

783
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:20,219
You love her, don't you?

784
01:13:25,687 --> 01:13:30,099
Love is not a big enough word.

785
01:13:30,191 --> 01:13:33,891
It's not a big enough word
for how I feel about my wife.

786
01:13:33,986 --> 01:13:36,773
- To the wives.
- To the wives.

787
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:44,951
Wow.

788
01:13:46,248 --> 01:13:49,782
Well, let me just
close this conversation

789
01:13:49,876 --> 01:13:52,830
by saying you are
one unique individual.

790
01:13:54,839 --> 01:13:58,172
What is unique? Latin for "asshole"?

791
01:13:59,218 --> 01:14:02,005
- Grab the vodka or I'll kick 'em.
- Yeah.

792
01:14:04,181 --> 01:14:05,889
Well, I'll tell you...

793
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:10,387
As much trouble as I've had,
one day I'll look back and laugh.

794
01:14:10,478 --> 01:14:13,183
You think so?

795
01:14:13,273 --> 01:14:15,728
Oh, I'm laughing already.

796
01:14:15,817 --> 01:14:17,394
Oh, God.

797
01:14:17,485 --> 01:14:19,358
When that car blew up.

798
01:14:19,445 --> 01:14:22,066
Was that seat hot or what?

799
01:14:22,156 --> 01:14:27,197
I felt like a big Whopper.
Turn me over. I'm done on this side.

800
01:14:27,285 --> 01:14:32,528
I'm afraid to look at my ass,
I'll have griddle marks on my ass...

801
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:37,915
What is that?

802
01:14:38,004 --> 01:14:40,245
Potato chips.

803
01:14:42,258 --> 01:14:44,250
They're everywhere!

804
01:14:44,343 --> 01:14:45,837
Ahh!

805
01:14:47,471 --> 01:14:49,463
This feels like summer camp.

806
01:14:49,556 --> 01:14:53,553
Ahh!

807
01:15:05,613 --> 01:15:08,150
Now, how the hell does this turn off?

808
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:11,075
Oh!

809
01:15:13,828 --> 01:15:15,572
Just a minute.

810
01:15:15,663 --> 01:15:18,700
- Give it a good push.
- All right.

811
01:15:18,791 --> 01:15:20,950
- All right.
- Oh, jeez.

812
01:15:26,298 --> 01:15:28,836
- Push! Push!
- I am! I am!

813
01:15:28,926 --> 01:15:31,595
Push, for Christ's sake!

814
01:15:31,678 --> 01:15:34,928
- We have to rock it.
- All right. OK.

815
01:15:35,015 --> 01:15:37,885
Up and down. Here we go. Ready?

816
01:15:37,976 --> 01:15:40,301
- Yeah.
- Here we go.

817
01:15:40,395 --> 01:15:43,016
Reverse!

818
01:15:49,653 --> 01:15:52,654
- Aww!
- Huh.

819
01:15:57,994 --> 01:15:59,619
Get in!

820
01:16:03,708 --> 01:16:05,118
Go!

821
01:16:21,349 --> 01:16:25,477
# Blue moon of Kentucky,
keep on shinin'

822
01:16:25,561 --> 01:16:29,393
# Shine on the one who's
gone and proved untrue

823
01:16:29,482 --> 01:16:33,811
# Blue moon of Kentucky,
keep on shinin'

824
01:16:33,902 --> 01:16:37,353
# Shine on the one who's
gone and left me blue

825
01:16:37,447 --> 01:16:40,199
# It was on a moonlit night

826
01:16:40,283 --> 01:16:42,074
# Stars shinin' bright

827
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:44,567
# They whispered from on high

828
01:16:44,662 --> 01:16:46,619
# Your love has said goodbye

829
01:16:46,706 --> 01:16:50,324
# Blue moon of Kentucky,
keep on shinin'... #

830
01:17:00,218 --> 01:17:02,009
Oh.

831
01:17:03,972 --> 01:17:07,506
Oh, great. Great. A cop. Watch it!

832
01:17:08,768 --> 01:17:10,595
How fast are you going?

833
01:17:10,686 --> 01:17:13,557
I can't tell.
The speedometer's melted.

834
01:17:13,647 --> 01:17:16,897
Top of the morning, Officer.
Hi.

835
01:17:16,984 --> 01:17:19,854
Is there something
I can help you with?

836
01:17:19,945 --> 01:17:24,772
- What the hell you driving?
- We had a small fire last night.

837
01:17:24,866 --> 01:17:27,535
You know how fast you were going?

838
01:17:27,619 --> 01:17:30,952
I was just talking
to my friend about that.

839
01:17:31,038 --> 01:17:36,245
Our speedometer's melted so it's very
hard to say how fast we were going.

840
01:17:36,335 --> 01:17:38,374
78 miles an hour.

841
01:17:38,462 --> 01:17:40,953
78, huh?

842
01:17:41,048 --> 01:17:43,538
Well, yeah. I could buy that. Sure.

843
01:17:43,633 --> 01:17:47,845
You'd know better than us, specially
since we got a melted speedometer.

844
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:51,428
Do you feel this vehicle
is safe for highway travel?

845
01:17:51,516 --> 01:17:54,267
Yes, I do. I really do.
I believe that...

846
01:17:54,352 --> 01:17:58,052
It's not pretty but it'll
get you where you want to go.

847
01:17:58,147 --> 01:18:01,064
- You got no outside mirror.
- We lost that.

848
01:18:01,149 --> 01:18:04,684
- You have no functioning gauges.
- No, not a one.

849
01:18:04,778 --> 01:18:08,692
However, the radio still works,
funny as that may seem.

850
01:18:08,782 --> 01:18:11,237
The radio's the only thing
that's working.

851
01:18:11,326 --> 01:18:14,196
It's clear as a bell.
Don't ask me how.

852
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:19,662
- I can't let you go in this vehicle.
- Can't what?

853
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:21,577
It's not fit for the road.

854
01:18:21,668 --> 01:18:25,452
It'll be impounded
until it can be made safe for travel.

855
01:18:25,547 --> 01:18:30,505
OK, Officer, I admit I broke the law,
and for that I'm really sorry.

856
01:18:30,593 --> 01:18:35,136
You got me there
and I won't argue one iota, I swear.

857
01:18:35,223 --> 01:18:37,511
However, um...

858
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,639
if you impound our car,

859
01:18:39,727 --> 01:18:44,020
I'm gonna be unable to get my friend
home for his Thanksgiving dinner.

860
01:19:14,717 --> 01:19:17,089
Well, our ship has come in.

861
01:19:22,766 --> 01:19:25,257
It's free, and it's non-stop.

862
01:19:25,352 --> 01:19:29,266
- I said I'd get you home.
- So long as the heater works.

863
01:19:29,356 --> 01:19:33,816
The driver's a little freaky
about people riding in his cab.

864
01:19:34,819 --> 01:19:39,397
- So we can't sit there.
- Then where are we supposed to ride?

865
01:19:41,117 --> 01:19:43,156
Beats walking, huh?

866
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:50,041
You're gonna be in Chicago in
less than three hours, around there.

867
01:19:50,125 --> 01:19:53,743
If we don't hit any traffic,
and I don't think we should.

868
01:19:53,837 --> 01:19:55,876
It's Thanksgiving.

869
01:19:56,423 --> 01:19:58,462
We're moving now.

870
01:20:31,121 --> 01:20:32,663
You believe this?

871
01:20:32,748 --> 01:20:35,951
- It's been a hell of a trip.
- Sure has.

872
01:20:36,042 --> 01:20:41,167
But, uh, after all's said and done,
you got me home and I appreciate it.

873
01:20:41,256 --> 01:20:44,292
Next time,
let's go first class, all right?

874
01:20:44,383 --> 01:20:48,760
- I hope there isn't a next time.
- I know what you mean!

875
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:53,382
This you?

876
01:20:55,227 --> 01:20:56,685
Yeah.

877
01:21:00,732 --> 01:21:04,646
It's been great meeting you.
Sorry if I caused any trouble.

878
01:21:04,736 --> 01:21:09,196
No, you didn't, you got me home,
and, uh... a little late...

879
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:11,238
Coupla days.

880
01:21:11,325 --> 01:21:14,575
But, uh... I'm a little wiser,
too, so...

881
01:21:14,661 --> 01:21:16,369
Me, too.

882
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:20,245
- Happy holidays.
- Same to you.

883
01:21:22,377 --> 01:21:26,161
Happy Thanksgiving, Neal.
Give my love to the family.

884
01:21:26,255 --> 01:21:30,798
- Maybe I'll meet them one day.
- Say hello to Marie for me.

885
01:21:30,885 --> 01:21:32,295
Yeah.

886
01:21:33,137 --> 01:21:34,761
So...

887
01:21:34,847 --> 01:21:36,257
OK.

888
01:21:36,348 --> 01:21:39,931
- And have a happy Thanksgiving.
- Hey, you know it.

889
01:21:40,018 --> 01:21:41,678
So long.

890
01:23:05,305 --> 01:23:07,594
I like... I like me.

891
01:23:07,682 --> 01:23:09,509
My wife likes me.

892
01:23:12,312 --> 01:23:16,060
At the very least,
the absolute minimum,

893
01:23:16,148 --> 01:23:19,731
you've got a woman you love
to grow old with, right?

894
01:23:25,073 --> 01:23:27,564
I spend too much time away.

895
01:23:27,659 --> 01:23:31,953
I haven't been home in years.

896
01:23:57,937 --> 01:24:00,392
Del, what are you doing here?

897
01:24:06,737 --> 01:24:10,437
You said you were going home.
What are you doing here?

898
01:24:11,908 --> 01:24:14,150
I, uh...

899
01:24:16,329 --> 01:24:18,321
I don't have a home.

900
01:24:25,004 --> 01:24:27,459
Marie's been dead for eight years.

901
01:25:03,498 --> 01:25:06,866
Boy, you are one lucky guy, Neal.

902
01:25:06,959 --> 01:25:09,201
I know.

903
01:25:11,171 --> 01:25:15,121
I won't stay long. Maybe I'll just
say hi, then I'll be on my way.

904
01:25:15,217 --> 01:25:17,043
Just come on.

905
01:25:34,484 --> 01:25:35,895
Hiya, kiddo.

906
01:25:35,986 --> 01:25:37,444
Daddy!

907
01:25:37,529 --> 01:25:39,153
Hey! Hey!

908
01:25:39,239 --> 01:25:40,899
Neal's home!

909
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:43,660
Del, my father-in-law, Walt,

910
01:25:43,743 --> 01:25:47,871
my mother-in-law, Peg,
my mother, Joy, and my dad, Martin.

911
01:25:47,955 --> 01:25:51,787
This little guy's Neal Jr,
my little gem, Marti,

912
01:25:51,876 --> 01:25:55,410
and somewhere around here
is my baby boy, Seth.

913
01:26:10,142 --> 01:26:13,179
Honey, I'd like you to meet
a friend of mine.

914
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,357
Hello, Mr Griffith.

915
01:26:21,444 --> 01:26:23,520
Hello, Mrs Page.

916
01:26:30,578 --> 01:26:35,489
# Every time you go away

917
01:26:35,583 --> 01:26:40,458
# You take a piece of me with you

918
01:26:42,339 --> 01:26:46,004
# Every time you go away

919
01:26:47,635 --> 01:26:52,511
# You take a piece of me with you

920
01:26:55,059 --> 01:26:57,810
# Ooh-hoo

921
01:27:05,318 --> 01:27:08,354
# Go on and go free

922
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:15,368
# Maybe you're too close to see

923
01:27:17,121 --> 01:27:20,406
# I can feel your body move

924
01:27:20,499 --> 01:27:22,741
# Yeah

925
01:27:22,834 --> 01:27:26,001
# It doesn't mean that much to me

926
01:27:28,089 --> 01:27:29,833
# Can't go on

927
01:27:29,924 --> 01:27:32,629
# Sayin' the same thing

928
01:27:34,095 --> 01:27:37,012
# Can't you see we've got everything

929
01:27:37,098 --> 01:27:40,597
# Even though, you know,
you know, yeah

930
01:27:40,684 --> 01:27:44,267
# Every time you go away

931
01:27:46,106 --> 01:27:49,190
# You take a piece of me

932
01:27:49,276 --> 01:27:52,146
# Take a piece of me with you #

933
01:28:06,583 --> 01:28:09,288
# You're messing with the wrong guy!

934
01:28:15,341 --> 01:28:17,547
# I can take anything

935
01:28:21,263 --> 01:28:22,888
# Who's that?

936
01:28:23,474 --> 01:28:25,098
# You're no saint

937
01:28:25,184 --> 01:28:27,888
# I never did introduce myself,
Del Griffith

938
01:28:29,021 --> 01:28:30,847
# Del Griffith, Del Griffith

939
01:28:31,773 --> 01:28:34,478
# Del Griffith
# I can take anything

940
01:28:35,777 --> 01:28:38,184
# Wow! #

941
01:28:42,867 --> 01:28:44,906
# I mean, that was close
