Jang-woo!

13
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,433
I brought you lunch!

14
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,868
Why is she here?

15
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:39,970
He's overprotective.

16
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,606
We got a princess in the making.

17
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,378
A little burned?

18
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,495
Not cooked enough?

19
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:04,364
So long as
it tastes good, right?

20

Enjoying your lunch in peace?

21
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,843
Shove it down
and get the rest done!

22
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,444
Look at them
shoving shit down.

23
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:19,578
My brother must be
doing all the work here.

24
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,550
If it weren't for them,
this'd be heaven.

25
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:28,280
My head! She's causing
high blood pressure.

26
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,784
Blood pressure is
supposed to go up!

27
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,157
That brat and her mouth!

28
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,838
Holding out on

29
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,296
Sign the consent form.

30
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,204
Finished already?

31
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,815
Eun-ji, baby.

32
00:02:56,376 --> 00:03:01,086
Are you going to school
or to a bar?

33
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,117
Why's your skirt so short?

34
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,291
I can see your asshole,
you brat!

35
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:18,438
I can take all your shit,
but not about my sis!

36
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:32,455
Here.

37
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,549
Who wears pants
under the skirt?

38
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,756
No way.

39
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,589
So freezing...

40
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,933
Mom! Dad!

41
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:53,500
- Your daughter is indecent!
- Okay, fine!

42
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,635
Fine!

43
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,873
I'll put it on!

44
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,111
Pain in the ass.

45
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,641
Major one!

46
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:07,648
Ow!

47
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,986
Hold on tight.

48
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,488
It hurts!

49
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:54,602
<i>Redevelopment is the only way</i>

50
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:26,391
Timing is key,
half beat faster.

51
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:27,962
Half beat?

52
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,271
This one works well.

53
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,604
You're right.

54
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,906
It swallowed $3 yesterday.

55
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,579
Should I reimburse you?

56
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:43,652
No, that's okay.
It's working now.

57
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,860
Mr. Suh, the claw machine
does the best business here.

58
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:56,023
A freebie to our best client.

59
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:59,797
It's all right,
I got a ton at home.

60
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:03,499
Me too, I got a ton.
See?

61
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:04,972
Here.

62
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,604
From my heart.

63
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,372
Thank you.

64
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,155
Han Eun-ji?

65
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,002
Where is she?

66
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,830
Eun-ji?

67
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,804
Anyone here?

68
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,782
Where did my sister go?

69
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,627
Why does my brother long for me?

70
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,028
Did something happen?

71
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:10,237
She asked me
to fetch that for her.

72
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,302
Pay it for me.

73
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,119
Let's go.

74
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:35,094
Go easy on him,
he's our VIP client.

75
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,332
We make a mint here.

76
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:48,938
How much?

77
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:54,709
You had to come here
when my hubby left for the sea?

78
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,721
Forget it, I'm not selling.

79
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:04,259
You're bad luck.
My day's ruined.

80
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,802
Isn't she the one
who sees ghosts?

81
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:20,741
Really?

82
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,606
<i>Lets hurry.</i>

83
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,718
My back!

84
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:23,066
- Where you at?
- Not again!

85
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,342
Come straight home
after class.

86
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,276
Know what day it is?

87
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:29,812
<i>Come on!</i>

88
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,045
<i>Must we do it every year?
I don't even remember them.</i>

89
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,285
Stop it, what's my motto?

90
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:39,546
<i>Work for you,
books for me.</i>

91
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,453
Good, I'm out.

92
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,459
Was that Eun-ji?
When is she coming?

93
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,533
Mind your business.

94
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,864
Myung-gyu, what's my motto?

95
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:56,732
Um, we're family!
One and only!

96
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,798
You're my mother's sister's...

97
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:03,872
Your mother's sister's,

98
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,878
new husband's stepson.

99
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,380
Super distant.

100
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:15,016
In any case,
we're still family, okay?

101
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:16,887
Line can't be crossed.

102
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:19,190
Not at all!
Very dangerous!

103
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,489
So you know,

104
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:25,528
then why did you call
and text her yesterday?

105
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,299
How did you know!

106
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,272
Run!

107
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:32,875
So it's true?

108
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,502
I told you not to!

109
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,735
Our Father in heaven,
your kingdom come,

110
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:16,948
your will be done,
on earth as in heaven.

111
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,119
Hey.

112
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:19,754
You Okay?

113
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,125
Lee Si-eun.

114
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,000
The ghost whisperer, right?

115
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,406
Is the rumor true?
That you see the future.

116
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:44,039
If it's so painful, just accept it
and become a shaman.

117
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,981
Like that other shaman.

118
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:52,654
What about my future?
What'll happen to me?

119
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,048
You know,

120
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:58,594
how I'll live,
whom I'll live with.

121
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:03,862
I got a big brother,
who will he marry?

122
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,831
IF he can get married.

123
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,168
I don't see that.

124
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,977
Only how one dies.

125
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:20,650
Still want to know?
How you'll die?

126
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,592
Even if you knew,
you'll still die.

127
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,761
Wanna hear it?

128
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,230
That's scary.

129
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,032
Why do you talk like that?

130
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:53,182
Can't you just ignore it?

131
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,942
If they'll die anyway,
it's not your fault.

132
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,850
Why don't you come with me?

133
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:01,889
Come here.

134
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,696
There's a hair shop in town.

135
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:07,993
Come see me there.

136
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,055
I'll wait for you.

137
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,110
<i>My brother will come for me.</i>

138
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:17,091
You only left me with
this house and Eun-ji.

139
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,159
I'll protect both.

140
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,839
Mom, dad!

141
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:37,611
I'll raise her properly.

142
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,116
Don't you worry.

143
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,810
Where the heck is that brat?

144
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:07,383
Have a good night,
and come back soon.

145
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,683
Sir, I'm opening
my own shop next year.

146
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:19,324
Please come see me there.

147
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,897
I'll take good care of you.

148
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,405
Jang-woo.

149
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:34,677
What!

150
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:40,238
Once I get my license,
I'll make a lot of money.

151
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,219
I'll take care of the money!

152
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:49,717
So what?

153
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:54,086
Once I get to college,
what about tuition?

154
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,462
Do you know
how much that costs?

155
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,330
Who asked you to
worry about that?

156
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,491
- I'll take care of it!
- $5,000 per semester!

157
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:01,562
That's nothing!

158
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,129
I can ask my school seniors.

159
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,337
You didn't even graduate.

160
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,940
They're useless.

161
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,622
I really don't need college.

162
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:24,250
I'll save up, open my shop
and live happily with you here.

163
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,702
You'll live like me?

164
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:38,203
In a hick town,
wreaking of bleach,

165
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:42,743
barely making ends meet,
forever like that?

166
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:52,222
Don't you dare go outside,
just study.

167
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,355
I'll go outside!

168
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:55,653
I will!

169
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:10,871
Bro!

170
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,302
What are you doing?
You're locking me inside?

171
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:15,973
Open this door!

172
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,045
Open!

173
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,485
Is he nuts?

174
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,732
We gotta support government's work.

175
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:49,574
You're the only hold out,
take the money and sign.

176
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:55,075
Look at next town over,
people are flocking to it.

177
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:01,649
What if they send gangsters
to harass your sister?

178
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,189
Mr. Kim.

179
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,132
Go all in.

180
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:18,941
Fine, fine.

181
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,273
What'll you wager?

182
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,003
You're almost empty.

183
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:29,352
I got rent to collect,
I'm out.

184
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:30,385
Ill...

185
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:32,643
wager this.

186
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:33,244
<i>Redevelopment Consent Form</i>

187
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,245
Redevelopment Consent Form
Would you look at that.

188
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,226
Would you look at that.

189
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:40,619
You even signed it,
but decided to cause him grief?

190
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,494
Bet everything you got.

191
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:45,798
Your factory, SHOP.

192
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,799
And your kid too.

193
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,606
Don't you dare.

194
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,438
Fine, I'll bite.

195
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:01,778
But if I win,
I'm taking everything.

196
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:04,786
Show me.

197
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,336
Have a great life!

198
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:36,450
My sister and I will live
happily ever after in Seoul.

199
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,780
Fuck...

200
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,417
Jang-woo?

201
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,710
Bro!

202
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,852
Jang-woo!

203
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:20,949
Help!

204
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,694
Help!

205
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,953
Go home,
isn't this for your sis?

206
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:02,989
Why you so drunk?

207
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,431
My brother can...

208
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,134
find me wherever I am.

209
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,946
Even in the middle of the ocean.

210
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,714
My brother will come for me.

211
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,379
How's the claw machine business?

212
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:55,614
Can you save up enough
to get married with those?

213
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:59,922
All right, here and here.

214
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,821
I heard you fought with her.

215
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:10,363
Thought she wouldn't bypass
a locked door?

216
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:17,636
Understand? She took off
after fighting with you.

217
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,837
Just wait 3 days.

218
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:28,380
She gets hungry and cold,
she'll come right back.

219
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:17,932
You...

220
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:08,583
Eun-ji...

221
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:23,932
<i>Eun-ji</i>

222
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:25,724
Where's Jang-woo?
I don't see him.

223
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:32,194
He's probably not himself,
he practically killed her.

224
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:35,030
How could he lock her in?

225
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:38,770
What'll happen to
our poor Jang-woo?

226
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:42,737
Despite his stubbornness,
he loved her so much.

227
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:45,811
But she had it coming.

228
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:50,949
With red lipstick and smile,
she was a jail bait.

229
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:53,451
I knew something was coming.

230
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,591
Look, that must be
'the soul scoop'.

231
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:01,987
What is it?

232
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,325
They float it with rice inside,

233
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,901
ghosts eat the rice,

234
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,971
and leave the dead's
nails and hair.

235
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:54,601
Stop it.

236
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:57,642
What do you want?

237
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,153
Look at that blood!
She's gonna die!

238
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,292
Get down here!

239
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:21,736
Where's the brass bowl?

240
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:44,323
Hey.

241
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,457
Hey, stop!

242
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:35,761
Anything in particular?

243
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,432
Is this a bestseller?

244
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,902
Super Comet?

245
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:45,838
We all got a pair during
last year's election campaign.

246
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:47,338
What's your size?

247
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:04,226
You're bad luck!

248
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:07,564
- What's with her?
- You vile thing!

249
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:24,382
You met Eun-ji,
didn't you?

250
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,782
Tell me how you
came to my place.

251
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,382
You must've known something!

252
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,922
- How did she...
- I saw her.

253
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:38,827
Saw what?
What did you see?

254
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,441
So the rumor's real.

255
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:52,275
'Cursed bitch'.

256
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:55,750
Let go!

257
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,519
I simply followed
my vision there.

258
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:13,593
I hate this
more than anything.

259
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:17,205
Things that I see.

260
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,342
Why does that matter now?

261
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,181
She's dead.

262
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:46,358
Jang-woo,
I'm told we got the killer.

263
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:48,298
Wanna go meet him?

264
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:53,306
He sent 1,000 paper cranes
and over a dozen presents.

265
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:54,633
1,000...

266
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:57,970
He must've imagined it
more than 1,000 times.

267
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:03,306
- And on that day, he called her twice.
- It wasn't me!

268
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:06,049
It'll be over soon.

269
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:07,781
Jang-woo!

270
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:13,786
Also, the victim's underwear
were recovered at his place.

271
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:16,961
Eun-ji's panties and bras.

272
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,562
That's smoking gun.

273
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,036
Jang-woo...

274
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:32,114
So the brass bowl was floating,

275
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,444
and there were waves.

276
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:38,612
And it stopped in front of...

277
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:41,119
- Super...
- Super Comet!

278
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:45,449
And Eun-ji's soul is telling us
who killed her?

279
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,460
Yes.

280
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,757
What a load of bullshit.

281
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:53,799
Don't say those things,
you'll be sent to the asylum.

282
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:56,627
Mister.

283
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:59,903
We should be using forensics
to investigate, right?

284
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:02,011
- What?
- Huh?

285
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:05,013
Shamanism has no place in
modern investigation.

286
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:06,978
He's not the killer!

287
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:08,972
He's a relative,
he's family!

288
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:10,247
More reason to!

289
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,911
About 40% of all rape cases

290
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:19,123
are carried out by
family members, and relatives.

291
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:24,222
And her undies were recovered
at his place!

292
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,937
But he always stole those
since a long time ago!

293
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,264
Right! Right!

294
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:32,201
I don't think rape was involved.

295
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,808
Come on, she was found disrobed!

296
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,947
And all disrobed cases are rape?

297
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:41,545
I think it was just murder,
there's no trace of rape.

298
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,649
Why else would she be
practically naked?

299
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:46,912
Whatever...

300
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:50,213
I couldn't care less about
brass bowl and Super Comet.

301
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:51,557
The evidence is clear.

302
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:55,654
Once you come clean,
this case is all but over.

303
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:58,662
They're so full of crap.

304
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,533
Order my lunch,
don't think.

305
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,241
<i>Li! Sis</i>

306
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:49,544
Hello?

307
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,923
Who is this? Why do you
have Eun-ji's phone?

308
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:02,295
How many times have I told you?

309
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:07,995
Sir, even the police require
a warrant for GPS tracking.

310
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:11,837
Please come back
with the phone owner.

311
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:15,811
It doesn't have an owner.

312
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:19,005
Did he go abroad
or something?

313
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:24,111
She's dead.

314
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,547
She's gone.

315
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,950
Are you happy now?

316
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,165
Oh, she's dead...

317
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:40,132
You should've said so earlier.

318
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,839
We need a death certificate,

319
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:52,878
national ID,
and proof of identity.

320
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:57,077
There's a protocol for this,
one moment, sir.

321
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,816
Sir! Wait!

322
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,146
Look, it's that girl.

323
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:55,506
Hey, I heard
you're like a psychic.

324
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,877
Can you see if we'd be
a good couple?

325
00:38:58,936 --> 00:38:59,836
Go on.

326
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:04,047
Fucking shaman bitch,
listen when someone talks.

327
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:08,080
- What's that?
- What is it?

328
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:11,815
Get with the program.

329
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,762
Bible?

330
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:17,830
- You could go to hell for that.
- Shut your hole.

331
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,492
Am I right?

332
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:21,702
Who the hell are you?

333
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,071
Why bother a harmless person?

334
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:29,069
Come here.

335
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,909
What the fuck, man.

336
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:40,021
Are you her brother
or something?

337
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:42,213
Me?

338
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,691
Yeah, you.

339
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:49,392
I'm a fucking bystander.

340
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,227
- Come with me.
- What the shit?

341
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:59,239
Hey! Bastard.

342
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:15,821
What's your name?

343
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:17,792
Si-eun.

344
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,123
Lee Si-eun.

345
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:28,659
Si-eun, you need to
do me a favor.

346
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:46,418
That's so messed up.

347
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,316
Why say that she's dead
when she's alive?

348
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:18,978
This is my house,
and most of these are empty.

349
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,987
So he called from nearby?

350
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,561
It's the last known position.

351
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:58,613
What happened?

352
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:02,924
Isn't it obvious?
I got it, of course.

353
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:07,828
So she caved in
after making such a fuss.

354
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:11,596
You deserve an award.

355
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:24,371
And the pharmacist?

356
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:28,379
I'm working on it.

357
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,898
<i>Li! Sis</i>

358
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,516
Jang-woo?

359
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:21,128
When did you get out?

360
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:25,996
A moment ago...

361
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:29,203
Not enough evidence...

362
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:31,567
Did you see
a runner just now?

363
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,304
That... way.

364
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:35,601
Saw his face?

365
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:38,846
Um, no, I didn't.

366
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:43,283
You know I didn't
kill her, right?

367
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:45,245
I know, I know.

368
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:46,987
Jang-woo!

369
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:45,472
What'd you like?

370
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,072
One energy drink, please.

371
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,240
Sure.

372
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:55,474
Here you go.

373
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,652
How are you holding up?

374
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:12,859
I know how devastating it is
when your loved one is gone.

375
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:17,003
Sorry, shouldn't have said that.

376
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:19,004
Give me a minute.

377
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:24,301
I wish I can
do something for you.

378
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:29,980
My shop may be small,
but it's got everything.

379
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:33,050
Fishing bait, canned food...

380
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,121
Take it, I insist.

381
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:46,126
And find the killer,

382
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:51,164
he deserves to be punished.

383
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,275
- Welcome.
- So cold...

384
00:48:58,201 --> 00:48:59,077
What can I get you?

385
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:02,546
My soles are hot nowadays.

386
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:05,248
Menopause, maybe?

387
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,017
No way, not a chance.

388
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:10,658
I'm still young.

389
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:15,759
It's because I got no man.

390
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,333
- Give me some cold meds.
- Someone sick?

391
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:23,436
The bane of my existence.

392
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:26,705
Studying makes him sick,
apparently.

393
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:30,105
Give me night time meds.

394
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:38,244
Here you go.

395
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:46,960
Oops, clumsy me.

396
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,738
How much?

397
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:07,471
$7, please.

398
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:19,783
Take care.

399
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:33,305
This is what I made today.

400
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:35,714
Okay.

What are you doing?
Get over here!

412
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:44,971
Rookie, come here.

413
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,839
Stay here for a minute.

414
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,700
I knew she was trouble
the moment she came to town.

415
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:54,204
- Get over here!
- Bring one more unit!

416

Goddammit.

417
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:06,985
It's really him.

418
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:11,265
Shut the hell up!

419
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:18,837
Don't you want to kill anyone
who feels fishy?

420

Jang-woo, of all people out there,
why the pharmacist?

421
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:28,641
He's practically a saint.

422
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:30,339
I found Super Comet there!

423
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,877
I'm more suspicious of you.

424
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:36,449
Her body was found
at your place,

425
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:40,223
and you're at murder scenes
before us.

426
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:42,685
So, tell me.

427
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:45,025
I said Si-eun told me about it.

428
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:51,632
This is nuts.

429
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:56,667
Brass bowl,
and now a shaman.

430
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:01,239
What?

431
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:06,978
Stop this witch hunt,
and go wait over there.

432
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,080
What a load of shit.

433
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:13,124
How long should I wait?

434
00:59:14,617 --> 00:59:18,531
Remember what you said before?

435
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,294
You said to wait just 3 days.

436
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:25,598
And then what happened?

437
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:29,540
After those 3 days,

438
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:33,507
she came back as a body!

439
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:40,611
Beaten up to a pulp,

440
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:45,792
bloody and bruised all over,

441
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:53,493
torn apart like paper...

442
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:04,774
Same as Eun-ji,
but it's not the same killer?

443
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:07,337
We'll investigate thoroughly.

444
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,249
Catch him!

445
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:11,952
Son of a bitch...

446
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:15,655
Catch him
and bring him to me!

447
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:18,125
Go catch him!
You asshole!

448
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:19,855
Bring him to me!

449
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:32,263
Don't ever come back here!

450
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:36,873
What a bad luck!

451
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:13,373
I wanted to...

452
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:18,211
spread her ashes
near my parents.

453
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:22,020
It's too cold,
so I'll do it in the spring.

454
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:28,392
That's what remains of her.

455
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,666
I'm sorry.

456
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,269
That day...

457
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:50,581
I thought it could be her.

458
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:58,025
She treated me
like a friend.

459
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:01,955
But I didn't do anything.

460
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,329
And she died like that.

461
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:09,097
Eun-ji and that woman...

462
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:13,698
Everyone dies around me.

463
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:20,372
Why's that your fault?

464
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:23,682
It's my fault...

465
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,085
for leaving her alone.

466
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:41,528
Si-eun, give me your phone.

467
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:46,173
Hand it over.

call me and
tell me everything.

01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:09,764
I'll be there before him
to catch the bastard.

471

Come here!
I got sweets!

472
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:32,712
Gather around!

473
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:34,609
- Who wants one?
- Me!

474
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:36,678
- Take one each.

I took on every possible jobs
in the old days.

483

I delivered food,
milk, newspaper,

even worked at a gas station.

485
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,373

503
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:37,897
Come on,
shuffle it better.

504
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:41,902
Shall we begin?

505
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:45,343
Buddy.

506
01:06:46,035 --> 01:06:48,106
Why're you bothering
the pharmacist?

507
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:51,684
He's a saint who brings
meds to the sick.

508
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:54,955
Cop! Cop! Cop!

509
01:06:58,214 --> 01:06:59,693
Get rid Of it!

510
01:07:06,989 --> 01:07:08,969
- Hurry up!
- The cards!

511
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:15,467
Hey.

512
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:19,279
Something feels odd.

513
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:22,343
Anyone gambling here?

514
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:26,150
Come on,
no gambling here.

515
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:29,884
Don't do it,
no more warnings.

516
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:32,724
Don't talk nonsense,
we'd never.

517
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:37,329
What was that fish called
'rock trout'?

518
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:43,096
I can't forget that taste,
is it expensive?

519
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:45,336
Not at all,
want one ready?

520
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:47,738
- There's no need.
-When do you need it?

521
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:50,410
- It's okay.
- Should I call you?

522
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:01,116
Hey!

523
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:03,222
<i>Yong-han!</i>

524
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:09,290
I didn't get caught once
after installing this.

525
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:14,428
That boar devours my fish
and just takes off.

526
01:08:18,227 --> 01:08:19,171
Here it is.

527
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:22,034
Whose car is that?

528
01:08:22,164 --> 01:08:25,270
White Avante,
who could it be?

529
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:29,308
It's the pharmacist.

530
01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:31,510
Was he here that day?

531
01:08:43,686 --> 01:08:45,688
What's he doing in the car?

532
01:08:57,533 --> 01:08:58,443
Stop!

533
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:00,407
Again! Go back!

534
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:05,717
That's Myung-gyu.

535
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:08,113
What? Myung-gyu?

536
01:09:09,278 --> 01:09:10,979
So he was with her that day.

537
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,748
Told you he was the one
from day one!

538
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:14,727
Fast forward.

539
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:16,692
You accused the wrong man.

540
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:28,032
Hey- Jang-woo!

541
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:30,042
Where's he going?

542
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:41,019
The boys?

543
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:43,745
They went to blackmail
that bald man.

544
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:44,747
Idiots.

545
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:48,650
But why's that bastard
want me at the school?

546
01:09:48,651 --> 01:09:50,426
Yuhang Middle?

547
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:51,691
Yeah.

548
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:58,935
Perverted bastards,
there's always something.

549
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:00,737
Here.

Where's Myung-gyu?
Did you see him?

554
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:45,484
Myung-gyu?
I think he went home early.

Hey, Jang-woo.

557
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:47,040
That night...

558
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:48,711
when Eun-ji was killed...

559
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:55,209
It wasn't me!
I didn't kill her!

560
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:58,054
Did you go to my place
that night?

561
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:03,597
Yeah, I was there.

562
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:05,666
She said you locked her up,

563
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:08,428
and needed to go to the salon,

564
01:12:08,691 --> 01:12:11,638
but she wasn't there.

565
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:13,932
Did you see the pharmacist?

566
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,631
The pharmacist?

567
01:12:16,632 --> 01:12:19,875
At Yong-han's shop,
a white Avante!

568
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:22,109
Oh, Avante

569
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:25,013
White...

570
01:12:32,781 --> 01:12:34,692
No one was in the car!

571
01:13:19,595 --> 01:13:22,269
You're better than
girls wanting sugar daddies.

572
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:23,372
What?

573
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:25,609
At least you're clear.

574
01:13:26,301 --> 01:13:29,407
All transaction, nothing more.

575
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:32,741
Load of shit.

576
01:13:35,377 --> 01:13:36,879
You already wasted 10 minutes.

577
01:13:40,482 --> 01:13:42,484
I don't buy something like women.

578
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:45,525
"Something"?

579
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:48,692
Then why am I here?

580
01:13:49,324 --> 01:13:52,567
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.

581

01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:10,689

Eun-ji and that woman.

588

I'm kidding,
just messing with you.

589

Do I look like a chump
who hides in the shadow,

590
01:14:46,081 --> 01:14:49,153
and rape and kill?

Asshole, I knew
it was you all along!

617
01:18:29,304 --> 01:18:31,284
I told you
I'd be watching you.

You okay?
Are you hurt?

619

- Sorry, I was mistaken.

623
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:18,986
Si-eun, what's with you?
You said on the phone...

624
01:19:18,987 --> 01:19:21,627
Nothing happened,
there is no girl.

625

What the hell's going on?

626
01:19:25,894 --> 01:19:28,431
She fainted outside,
so I brought her in.

627
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:30,737
He must've overreacted.

Son of a bitch!
He's the one!

Enjoyed playing shaman

Is it fun?

636
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:19,321
Vandalism! Assault!

Obstruction of justice!

638
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:27,966
I'll lock you up for good!

639
01:20:28,089 --> 01:20:29,261
It was me!

640
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:37,041
It's all me,
he didn't do anything.

641
01:20:42,437 --> 01:20:47,887
I'll leave town.

642
01:20:53,215 --> 01:20:54,523
I'll disappear.

643
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:10,172
They're fucking with us.

644
01:21:19,074 --> 01:21:20,246
You'll die.

645
01:21:20,809 --> 01:21:22,720
Please stop.

646
01:21:24,412 --> 01:21:25,755
No more.

647
01:21:43,632 --> 01:21:46,806
Get Mr. Suh's signature
and release him.

648
01:21:49,771 --> 01:21:51,114
And keep Jang-woo overnight.

649
01:21:52,774 --> 01:21:53,775
Yes, sir.

650
01:22:09,124 --> 01:22:10,125
Mr. Suh?

651
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:13,001
Check your name and address,
then sign here.

652
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:17,636
What's the hold up?
Send him home at once.

653
01:22:20,468 --> 01:22:21,310
You're free to go.

654
01:22:36,751 --> 01:22:38,196
What did you do in the car?

655
01:22:41,556 --> 01:22:44,969
It's captured on CCTV.

656
01:22:47,996 --> 01:22:52,706
There's a witness who says
you weren't inside.

657
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:01,882
There are no coincidences.

658
01:23:03,678 --> 01:23:05,749
The brass bowl landed
before you.

659
01:23:07,949 --> 01:23:10,259
And I chased you
through the alleys.

660
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:14,330
You're a tenacious one.

661
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:24,066
Sure, it was me.

662
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:32,577
Your overreaction led us
to this situation.

663
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:41,692
I loathed your sister's
every word, every gesture.

664
01:23:44,586 --> 01:23:45,656
Take a look.

665
01:23:50,658 --> 01:23:51,966

01:24:01,169 --> 01:24:04,616
<i>Even in the middle of the ocean.</i>

668
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:08,111
<i>He'll find me.</i>

669
01:24:30,031 --> 01:24:32,705
You son of a bitch!

670
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:47,881
She really cared about you.

671
01:24:47,882 --> 01:24:52,388
But you were gambling
while she was dying.

672
01:24:56,724 --> 01:25:00,694
Say 'yes',
this evidence disappears.

673
01:25:00,695 --> 01:25:02,732
But she lives.

674
01:25:03,064 --> 01:25:05,766
Say 'no',
you can have this,

675
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:08,111
but she dies.

676
01:25:10,538 --> 01:25:11,881
Who am I talking about?

677
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:26,824
So, delete or not?

678
01:25:30,692 --> 01:25:33,866
Delete?
Just nod your head.

679
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:44,943
Okay, delete.

680
01:25:52,881 --> 01:25:53,916
Jang-woo.

681
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,058
Do you trust me?

682
01:26:31,386 --> 01:26:33,820
I'm taking Mr. Suh back.

683
01:26:33,821 --> 01:26:35,528
<i>Your fish is ready.</i>

684
01:26:35,623 --> 01:26:37,500
If it's a lot, I won't go.

685
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:40,799
- Come by.
- You're killing me.

686
01:26:41,396 --> 01:26:43,137
Okay, fine.

687
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:44,965
I got another call.

688
01:26:44,966 --> 01:26:46,343
- <i>Okay.</i>
- See you.

689
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:54,141
What is it?

690
01:26:54,142 --> 01:26:59,558
<i>You know that abandoned
house on the hill?</i>

691
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:03,954
<i>The one where a family
was murdered.</i>

692
01:27:10,124 --> 01:27:12,764
<i>It was owned by
a pharmacist back then.</i>

693
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:16,137
<i>He got sick after
his second marriage.</i>

694
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:22,348
<i>He had a daughter,
but turns out she was autistic.</i>

695
01:27:22,437 --> 01:27:23,575
<i>Then one day...</i>

696
01:27:47,462 --> 01:27:49,169
I'm sick of that sound.

697
01:27:58,539 --> 01:28:01,816
She won't move
without this snack.

698
01:28:03,177 --> 01:28:06,750
<i>Looks like his entire family died.</i>

699
01:28:07,081 --> 01:28:09,186
<i>Only one person came out alive.</i>

700
01:28:09,484 --> 01:28:10,690
<i>Know who that was?</i>

701
01:28:11,419 --> 01:28:14,025
<i>It was Mr. Suh,
the pharmacist.</i>

702
01:28:14,322 --> 01:28:15,562
<i>Isn't that weird?</i>

703
01:28:16,758 --> 01:28:21,366
<i>He only went to middle school,
can pharmacists do that?</i>

704
01:28:38,346 --> 01:28:40,451
Ma'am!
Dad's acting up!

705
01:28:40,548 --> 01:28:41,822
He's not breathing!

706
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:45,522
Ma'am!
Please help him!

707
01:28:45,887 --> 01:28:47,958
Please! Help!

708
01:28:48,589 --> 01:28:52,359
I told you not to disturb me
when he's here.

709
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:53,930
It looks bad.

710
01:28:54,462 --> 01:28:59,207
Everyone's all messed up,
shouldn't you at least be normal?

711
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:01,503
You stupid moron!

712
01:29:01,803 --> 01:29:06,411
I told you not to disturb us!
Are you deaf and dumb?!

713
01:29:13,047 --> 01:29:15,254
What a fucking moron!

714
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:33,578
Suzy...

715
01:29:37,338 --> 01:29:38,339
Suzy?

716
01:29:41,909 --> 01:29:43,149
Suzy!

717
01:29:47,315 --> 01:29:48,453
What do we do now?

718
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:52,127
The house is almost ours,
let's finish this today.

719
01:29:55,022 --> 01:29:56,057
What about the boy?

720
01:29:56,758 --> 01:29:58,635
Let's eat first.

721
01:29:58,793 --> 01:30:00,466
This crab is so good.

722
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:09,813
I gotta crack this open.

723
01:30:13,908 --> 01:30:15,353
So full of meat inside.

724
01:30:59,887 --> 01:31:02,493
Eat something.

725
01:31:03,057 --> 01:31:04,934
You should eat.

726
01:31:08,529 --> 01:31:11,476
- You son of a bitch!
- Calm down!

727
01:31:11,866 --> 01:31:12,970
You can't do this!

728
01:31:13,334 --> 01:31:16,144
Si-eun, she's in danger.

729
01:31:21,275 --> 01:31:23,983
- You bastard!
- Get him!

730
01:32:44,825 --> 01:32:46,361
It was you.

731
01:33:15,389 --> 01:33:17,960
<i>Cross reflection off a puddle!</i>

732
01:33:18,559 --> 01:33:19,970
The cross...

733
01:33:33,808 --> 01:33:36,015
I heard this place'll
get demolished,

734
01:33:37,478 --> 01:33:40,152
so I moved back
for old times' sake.

735
01:33:43,551 --> 01:33:45,963
Must I move again?

736
01:33:49,023 --> 01:33:50,400
Please stop this.

737
01:33:52,526 --> 01:33:53,436
Suzy...

738
01:33:54,228 --> 01:33:55,901
will want that too.

739
01:34:02,570 --> 01:34:10,011
Wood carving was
my father's favorite hobby.

740
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:15,259
Time would fly
while he was carving.

741
01:34:15,549 --> 01:34:22,626
But that woman said
this made too much mess,

742
01:34:23,457 --> 01:34:27,200
and she nagged
and nagged!

743
01:34:29,397 --> 01:34:31,707
As soon as she joined my family,

744
01:34:34,468 --> 01:34:36,072
it all went to hell.

745
01:34:41,575 --> 01:34:42,679
My father,

746
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:48,118
and Suzy...

747
01:34:51,752 --> 01:34:53,231
Sol killed her.

748
01:34:56,424 --> 01:34:57,528
With that.

749
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:17,690
Did you sleep with him?

750
01:35:31,058 --> 01:35:33,299
All dirty things must die.

751
01:36:57,845 --> 01:36:58,846
Si-eun!

752
01:37:06,887 --> 01:37:07,991
You'll die.

753
01:37:11,392 --> 01:37:12,837
You must leave.

754
01:37:14,895 --> 01:37:16,896
You'll die here.

755
01:37:16,897 --> 01:37:18,342
I won't leave without you!

756
01:37:18,499 --> 01:37:19,375
Jang-woo...

757
01:37:20,167 --> 01:37:21,111
Jang-woo!

758
01:37:27,208 --> 01:37:28,278
No!

759
01:38:08,949 --> 01:38:09,859
Jang-woo!

760
01:38:32,106 --> 01:38:33,084
No!

761
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:34,510
No!

762
01:39:19,219 --> 01:39:20,289
Suzy.

763
01:39:22,456 --> 01:39:23,867
Why're you still here?

764
01:39:30,197 --> 01:39:31,540
No.

765
01:39:33,033 --> 01:39:34,774
I can't stop now.

766
01:39:40,207 --> 01:39:41,049
Suzy?

767
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:47,850
Suzy?

768
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:53,562
Suzy?

769
01:39:53,754 --> 01:39:54,994
When Eun-ji was...

770
01:39:58,892 --> 01:40:00,166
6 or so...

771
01:40:03,998 --> 01:40:07,775
My parents died
in a car accident,

772
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:13,114
and we were at their funeral.

773
01:40:16,777 --> 01:40:18,984
She held my hand tight,

774
01:40:20,881 --> 01:40:21,985
and said to me,

775
01:40:28,122 --> 01:40:29,567
"Don't cry,

776
01:40:33,727 --> 01:40:36,469
I'll always be by your side.

777
01:40:39,066 --> 01:40:40,636
Don't cry."

778
01:40:52,813 --> 01:40:57,660
That's who you took away.

779
01:41:01,121 --> 01:41:02,896
All torn apart,

780
01:41:05,826 --> 01:41:08,033
a bloody mess...

781
01:41:10,798 --> 01:41:12,675
in that cold water...

782
01:41:35,122 --> 01:41:36,328
I'll kill you,

783
01:41:40,227 --> 01:41:41,501
before I die.

784
01:41:43,397 --> 01:41:45,172
Motherfucker!

785
01:43:57,631 --> 01:43:59,966
- Sushi!
- Little one!

786
01:43:59,967 --> 01:44:01,275
Sushi!

787
01:44:38,438 --> 01:44:39,576
A bit burned, right?

788
01:44:39,973 --> 01:44:41,213
It's okay.

789
01:44:41,842 --> 01:44:43,378
So long as it tastes good.
