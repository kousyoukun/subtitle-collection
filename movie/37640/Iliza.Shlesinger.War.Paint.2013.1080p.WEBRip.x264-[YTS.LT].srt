1
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:12,080
- Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:15,216
Iliza Shlesinger!

3
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:25,894
- All right!

4
00:00:25,927 --> 00:00:29,130
Dallas, Texas!

5
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:30,865
Thank you.

6
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:42,443
Oh.

7
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:44,145
How are you guys doing?
Thank you for coming out, y'all.

8
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:46,014
Fantastic.

9
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:50,351
I am so excited and honored
to be shooting my hour special

10
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,820
in my hometown of Dallas, Texas.

11
00:00:51,853 --> 00:00:54,088
Yes, ma'am.

12
00:00:56,424 --> 00:00:57,692
I'm so excited to be here.

13
00:00:57,726 --> 00:00:59,427
Not thrilled with getting here.

14
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,929
I have to be honest.

15
00:01:00,962 --> 00:01:05,299
I fly enough that I feel
I have the right to say this.

16
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,736
If you work for an airline,

17
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:09,904
I hate you.

18
00:01:09,938 --> 00:01:11,940
Okay?
I hate you.

19
00:01:11,973 --> 00:01:13,307
And I don't want to hear,

20
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:15,309
"No, my cousin Sheila's
a real sweetheart.

21
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:16,210
She works for Southwest."

22
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:18,079
Fuck your cousin Sheila.

23
00:01:19,848 --> 00:01:21,783
All right, your cousin Sheila's
a goddamn bitch.

24
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:24,152
And I'll tell you
something else.

25
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:25,720
The only reason
people work for airlines

26
00:01:25,754 --> 00:01:29,257
is because the Nazi party
is no longer hiring.

27
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:33,828
I don't have an issue...
Thank you.

28
00:01:33,862 --> 00:01:35,696
I don't have an issue
with flying.

29
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,698
My issue is with the boarding
of the plane.

30
00:01:37,732 --> 00:01:39,901
Has anyone else here
ever had the misfortune

31
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:43,537
of being stuck
in boarding zone four?

32
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:44,973
Like, that's when
you have a seat...

33
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:46,741
You have a ticket
'cause you're holding it...

34
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:48,709
But you're so low
on the food chain,

35
00:01:48,743 --> 00:01:50,378
it pretty much goes,
like, first-class,

36
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:52,646
luggage, terrorists, maybe you.

37
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:56,918
And they take
such painstaking care

38
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:58,953
to board zones
one through three.

39
00:01:58,987 --> 00:02:00,654
And if you don't fly
that airline often enough,

40
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:02,656
you are S.O.L. In terms
of getting on that plane

41
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,492
'cause they are boarding groups
of people

42
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:05,459
that you didn't even know

43
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:08,997
you could apply to be part of.

44
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,999
We're gonna start boarding
flight 556 to Dallas/Fort Worth.

45
00:02:11,032 --> 00:02:12,967
We're gonna start boarding
zone one.

46
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:14,635
These are
our first-class passengers,

47
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:15,603
our first members,
our gold members,

48
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:16,838
our golden shower members.

49
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:19,307
There you go.
Thank you, there you go.

50
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,741
Right this way.

51
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:22,777
Our Golden Eagle members,
our Eagle Face members.

52
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:24,879
If you have an eagle face
instead of a person face

53
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:27,115
'cause you lost your face

54
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:30,151
in some sort of horrible Holiday
Turkey deep fry accident,

55
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:31,585
you didn't have enough butt fat

56
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:32,921
to get a nose grafted
onto your face,

57
00:02:32,954 --> 00:02:34,755
so you had to borrow one
from an eagle,

58
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:35,656
so now you have a beak,
and you like to eat mice,

59
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,125
you can get on the plane.

60
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:38,860
Boarding zone two...
These are our silver members,

61
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:40,461
our silver star members,
our silver surfer members.

62
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,963
If anybody likes comic books,
you're a fuckin' nerd.

63
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,932
You can sit in the back
of the plane.

64
00:02:43,965 --> 00:02:45,466
Silver hair, if you're old,
hurry the fuck up.

65
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,368
Silver spoons, if you like
Ricky Schroder, '80s TV shows,

66
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,203
you were born really wealthy,
you can get on the plane.

67
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:50,738
Silver bullet summer...
No, ma'am, you cannot bring

68
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,540
your coors light
up in this, bitch.

69
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,675
Boarding zone three.

70
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:59,247
These are our...

71
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,415
These are our Copper members,
our Copper Star members,

72
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:02,783
our Copper Topper members.

73
00:03:02,817 --> 00:03:04,185
Is anybody using
a Duracell-operated device?

74
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:05,653
I don't give a shit
if it's a pacemaker.

75
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,420
You turn that off for takeoff.

76
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:07,655
Copperhead.

77
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,190
If you have a copperhead snake
as a pet

78
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:11,192
instead of a normal goddamn pet
like a dog or a cat,

79
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:12,894
you're like, "Fuck it,
I'm gonna get me a snake."

80
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:15,096
"Yeah, fuck you, dad.
I'm not going to law school."

81
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:16,797
"I'm gonna go
to Art School Online"

82
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:18,132
"and learn how to draw dragons"

83
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,267
"and manage a hot topic
in my spare time."

84
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,768
"I love my snake."

85
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,036
"I'm bringing her
to Thanksgiving."

86
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,804
"Her name is Judy.
We're in snake love."

87
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:24,672
"I love her so much.
Don't touch me, mom."

88
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,107
You get on the plane.

89
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,343
And boarding zone four,
you can go fuck yourself.

90
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,187
Now boarding all zones.

91
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:42,556
I spend a lot of time traveling.

92
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,458
Spend a lot of time in hotels.

93
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:46,794
And as a result of it,
I watch a lot of TV.

94
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,029
And I think
the saddest commercial out there

95
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:52,733
has to be the S.P.C.A.
Sarah McLachlan ad.

96
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,468
Seen it?

97
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:57,105
With the fucked up animals?

98
00:03:57,138 --> 00:04:00,008
Can I tell you a secret
about this commercial?

99
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:03,377
It knows when you're alone.

100
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,948
Do you ever notice
it only comes on

101
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:09,150
when you're by yourself,
maybe you're drunk?

102
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:12,020
You're vulnerable, right?

103
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:13,587
And what's crazy is at first,

104
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:15,723
yes, you are sad
for the animals.

105
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,258
But the longer you watch it,

106
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:20,661
the longer your sadness
kind of begins to turn on you,

107
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:21,896
and by the end of it, somehow,

108
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,967
you just feel really bad
for yourself?

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,936
You're sitting there,
like, "Oh, my God."

110
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:30,704
There's... that cat
doesn't have a face."

111
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:32,640
I don't know.
"I'm so sad.

112
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:33,942
"I feel so bad for him.

113
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:35,709
"And I feel so bad
for his cat family.

114
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:39,247
And I feel so bad for... ME."

115
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,384
"Oh, God.
What am I gonna do?

116
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:44,752
"What should I do?

117
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,355
I should... I should...
I should get a cat."

118
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:48,756
So you get a cat.

119
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,658
But because he's
from the S.P.C.A.,

120
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:54,462
like, let's be honest, he's all,
like, fucked up and autistic.

121
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:56,030
Just shits everywhere.

122
00:04:56,064 --> 00:04:59,100
You're like, "oh, my God.
What did you eat?"

123
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,568
Goes through your stuff.

124
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:03,404
He only eats the buttons
off your good sweaters.

125
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:05,139
You're like, "How did you know
to go to for the good sweaters?"

126
00:05:05,173 --> 00:05:06,807
"Why didn't you go
for the crappy sweaters?

127
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,278
Why do you have
such exquisite taste?"

128
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:13,014
Gotta get rid of him
'cause he's ruining everything.

129
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:15,849
But what do you do?
You can't kill him because...

130
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:18,152
Because that's fucking insane,
I guess.

131
00:05:18,186 --> 00:05:19,587
But you gotta get rid of him.
So what do you do?

132
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,688
I'm gonna tell you.

133
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:22,991
You put kitty in the car.

134
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:24,925
You drive him to a neighborhood
he doesn't know.

135
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:30,464
You let him out of the car.

136
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:31,699
Don't worry.

137
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:36,037
The S.P.C.A.
Will find that cat.

138
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,405
I don't know if you've noticed.

139
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:41,942
They're in the business
of secondhand cattery.

140
00:05:41,976 --> 00:05:44,112
They find the cat.
They clean him off.

141
00:05:44,145 --> 00:05:47,815
They update his résumé.

142
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,783
He gets a job managing,
like, a Chipotle.

143
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:52,753
He's fine, all right?

144
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,022
So in honor of that commercial,

145
00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:57,125
I have a treat for you guys.

146
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:06,000
This is my cat.

147
00:06:18,246 --> 00:06:21,115
This is my dog Blanche,
and I adopted her.

148
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:22,950
And sometimes when you adopt
an animal,

149
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,585
you don't know their back story.

150
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:28,156
So for Blanche, I made one up.

151
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:30,758
In my house,
we pretend that Blanche

152
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,527
used to be a dog prostitute...

153
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,939
Which makes sense,
because as you can tell,

154
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:49,077
she's a little sad
behind the eyes...

155
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,744
But she clearly has no problem

156
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:52,380
with you staring
at her dog vagina.

157
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:04,292
Make it rain.

158
00:07:04,325 --> 00:07:07,295
Shake it for the money.

159
00:07:07,328 --> 00:07:09,797
So in honor of that commercial,
she and I are now going to do

160
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,399
our rendition of it for you.

161
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:14,635
Here we go.

162
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,707
In the arms

163
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,611
of the angel,

164
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:28,082
far away

165
00:07:28,116 --> 00:07:30,918
from here,

166
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:36,424
in this dark, cold hotel room,

167
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:38,759
and the end,

168
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:42,696
dah, dah, dah, dah, dah

169
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:48,236
you were pulled...

170
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:51,239
That's it.
That's it for Blanche.

171
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:58,479
Let's get serious.

172
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:00,013
My dog is so cute,
I want to hurt her.

173
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:02,049
Do you ever get that way?

174
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,451
When something is so cute,
it makes you angry.

175
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:05,553
I just want to rip its nose
and...

176
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:07,388
You ever get that way
when something is so cute,

177
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:08,989
you don't know if you can
trust yourself around it?

178
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,158
I used to get that way
with my Nana.

179
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:12,126
She's, like, this tall,
and you ever hug

180
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,294
your grandparent,
and you're, like, "Oh, my God",

181
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,762
I just wanna push you
down the stairs."

182
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:17,097
You ever feel that way?

183
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:18,132
You ever feel the urge,
just, "What if I just..."

184
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,668
"Just feel like..."

185
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,203
Hypothetically.

186
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:24,372
Sometimes, I get that way
around garbage disposals.

187
00:08:24,405 --> 00:08:27,040
You ever just put your hand in
just to feel the... feel the fear?

188
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:32,480
You reach the other hand over.

189
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,081
You don't touch the switch,
but you hover around it?

190
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,216
You're like,
"What if I just..."

191
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:36,384
"NO!"

192
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:36,384
"No!"

193
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:42,623
I don't do that either.
It was just a joke.

194
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:45,459
Sometimes you get that way
with cute things, like babies.

195
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:46,827
Sometimes babies are so cute.

196
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,162
Sometimes babies
are not so cute.

197
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:50,030
But sometimes babies...
So cute,

198
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,299
you know,
fat, little, baby cheek.

199
00:08:51,332 --> 00:08:54,101
You just want
to rip his cheek off.

200
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,940
But you can't 'cause you won't

201
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,742
be allowed
around the baby anymore.

202
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,577
That's for goddamn sure.

203
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:05,346
There was another version
of that commercial.

204
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,316
What happened was they aired
that commercial.

205
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:11,084
And it was such a hit, so many
people were adopting pets,

206
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:12,820
so many people
were donating money,

207
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:17,191
so many people were
going on antidepressants.

208
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:18,492
And they were like,
"Let's do another one."

209
00:09:18,526 --> 00:09:21,061
So they tried to recreate
the magic of that one.

210
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,263
So in this commercial, they play

211
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:24,498
another Sarah McLachlan song,
okay?

212
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:27,835
I don't know the song,
but it's some lesbian chant.

213
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:28,802
That's happening.

214
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:33,807
And they zoom in
on these pictures

215
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:35,108
of these jacked up animals.

216
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:36,844
And at the bottom of the screen,

217
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:40,548
they put a caption
of what the animal is thinking?

218
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:46,287
Now, where they got
that information, I don't know.

219
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,389
They show a dog,
and he's all no teeth.

220
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:52,059
He's just awful-looking,
like, "Nah!"

221
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,827
"Where's my family?"

222
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:56,264
"I don't know!"

223
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,634
They show another dog,
and he's all muddy and gnarly.

224
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:02,936
He's just, "Nah!"

225
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,105
"I hope they come back
for me."

226
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,207
"Nah!

227
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:09,510
"Dad, you said you was
going for cigarettes.

228
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:11,679
"Why?

229
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:14,582
It's me, Spot."

230
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:15,949
And then, they showed a cat.

231
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:18,252
And this cat was,
like, 45 pounds.

232
00:10:18,286 --> 00:10:21,589
It... it had one eye.

233
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,123
And it turned...
Do you know him?

234
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:26,260
And it turned around...
He turned around in slow motion,

235
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:28,128
and it wasn't a camera trick.

236
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,731
He's just, like,
a 45-pound cat, I guess.

237
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:32,700
He doesn't have,
like, a meeting to rush to.

238
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:33,567
So he's not...

239
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:54,322
"I'm sorry
for whatever I did wrong."

240
00:10:54,355 --> 00:10:56,023
No, that's where I stopped
buying that commercial.

241
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,592
There's no way
a cat has remorse.

242
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,429
You ever met a cat?

243
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:02,863
There's no way he's apologetic.

244
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:04,498
Whatever that cat did
to land him in cat jail,

245
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:06,099
he's not sorry he did it.

246
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,501
He's sorry he got caught.

247
00:11:07,535 --> 00:11:10,771
There's a difference.

248
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:17,277
That cat's as hard as they come.
He doesn't give a shit.

249
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:18,812
He's sitting there
in his little cat cell.

250
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:22,483
He's got "Meow Mix for life"
tattooed on his little belly.

251
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,352
He's got a little rat
that he's made his bitch.

252
00:11:24,385 --> 00:11:27,054
It's carving a shiv
out of cheese in the corner.

253
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:28,456
He's got one sharpened cat claw.

254
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:31,158
He's just running it
against the bars, like, "Brr."

255
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,226
"Brr."

256
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,027
Oh, yeah, he's got one eye.
I forgot.

257
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:36,497
"Brr.  Brr."

258
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,165
He's like, "hear me?"

259
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,934
"I don't give a fuck."

260
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:42,302
"You think I care?

261
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:44,405
"Oh, hell, yeah,
I scratched up your curtains.

262
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:46,807
And I'd do it again.
Fuck you."

263
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:51,011
This is a cat paw.

264
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,620
That commercial is sad.

265
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:01,522
The commercial that makes me
feel the worst about myself,

266
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:05,626
I would have to say, would be
the P90X commercials.

267
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:09,763
That commercial always comes on
when I'm eating...

268
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:12,666
Which is the worst time

269
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,635
for any fitness commercial
comes on 'cause it knows

270
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:16,737
when you're sitting there
being a little fatty,

271
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,572
eatin' Graham Crackers
with your shirt off,

272
00:12:18,606 --> 00:12:19,673
SVU.

273
00:12:19,707 --> 00:12:21,809
It knows.

274
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:24,378
And it comes on, and it gets
you, you're just sittin' there.

275
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:25,546
You're like,
"I'll never find love.

276
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,515
I don't know.
I don't..."

277
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:29,650
"Do you want to get in shape?"

278
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:33,320
You're like...

279
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:38,258
And by the way,
it's not asking you

280
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,694
if you want to get
in regular-person shape.

281
00:12:40,728 --> 00:12:42,329
it's not talking
to normal people.

282
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,264
it's talking
to, like, Navy Seals.

283
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:45,566
it's talking to crazy people.

284
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,568
it's not asking you
if you want to look mediocre

285
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,437
when you go to the pool
this summer, uh-uh.

286
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,038
It's just for crazy...
it's saying,

287
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,841
"Hey, faggot, do you want to get
in such fucking good shape

288
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:55,543
"so fucking quickly
that your arms

289
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:57,411
"and your...
And your chest and your back

290
00:12:57,445 --> 00:12:58,946
"get too big to fit
through normal doorways,

291
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:01,849
"so every time you come through,
you smash into the plaster,

292
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:03,083
"and you're costing your mother
thousands of dollars

293
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,084
"in drywall damage?

294
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,586
"Is that what you want?

295
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,320
"Do you want your friends
and family to fear you

296
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:08,856
"because you drink
horse testosterone

297
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:11,659
"and creatine shakes,
and they make you sleep outside?

298
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:13,961
"Is that what you fuckin' want?

299
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,429
"Do you want to get so huge
so quickly,

300
00:13:15,463 --> 00:13:17,030
"so unnaturally,
that all your clothes

301
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:19,032
"shrink on you,
and they fit like baby clothes

302
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:20,834
"'cause you're like the hulk
mid-transformation,

303
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:22,670
"and you can't afford
to buy new clothes

304
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:25,906
'cause you spent all your money
on these fucking P90X DVDs?"

305
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,182
My question is why?

306
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,184
Why would the average guy

307
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:39,553
want to get that jacked
that fast?

308
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:43,290
Why? so you can, what,
be the strongest manager

309
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:47,394
at the Verizon store?

310
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:48,729
What are you doing
with that muscle?

311
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:50,998
You work in sales.
You're not guarding Sparta.

312
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:53,634
It's fine.

313
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,737
"This is smart phone."

314
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:01,174
I think P90X has
a subliminal message

315
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,976
that a lot of us are missing

316
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,645
'cause I don't think they're
talking to regular people.

317
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,715
I think the commercial needs
to be honest and come clean

318
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:10,450
and say what their product
is really meant for.

319
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:12,419
The commercial
should sound like this.

320
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:14,522
"Hey, P90X guy here.
What's up?

321
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:18,358
"So did you,
like, recently commit a crime,

322
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:20,894
"and you've been sentenced
to prison,

323
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:25,465
and you have to report there
in 90 days, so..."

324
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,841
"You figure in the interim,

325
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,408
"you'll just get as huge
as possible

326
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,778
"for fear of the safety
of your butthole?

327
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:40,013
P90X."

328
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:44,284
Yeah.

329
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:46,186
It's a prison workout.

330
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,521
They're like, "you can do it"

331
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:48,922
from the comfort
of your own living room."

332
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:50,323
That's 'cause your living room
and a jail cell

333
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:51,959
are roughly
the same square footage.

334
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:53,326
Do the math.

335
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,795
Think about it.
"No equipment.

336
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:56,630
No excuses."
No shit there's no equipment.

337
00:14:56,664 --> 00:14:58,265
You'll get raped
with equipment in prison.

338
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,367
You can't have it there.

339
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,102
"We here at P90X
want you to get creative

340
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:03,604
"with your workout.
Fuck your antiques, bro.

341
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:04,705
"Your girlfriend's
gonna break up with you

342
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,106
"when you go to jail anyway.

343
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,708
"May as well use shit
around your house.

344
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,342
"Take your dining room table.
Cut off the back legs.

345
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:10,744
"Put it at an angle.

346
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:12,913
"Now, you have a bench
for incline presses.

347
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:14,548
"P90X.

348
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:16,516
"Go ahead.
Grab your old Kenwood speakers.

349
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,685
"That's right.
Take 'em off the front lawn.

350
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:19,086
"Use those for weight.

351
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:20,287
"You can take water bottles.
Dump that shit out.

352
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,321
"Fill 'em up with sand.

353
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:22,923
"Use those for bicep curls

354
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,592
"'cause you're too cheap
to buy a shake weight.

355
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:25,759
"You're gonna get enough of this
in prison.

356
00:15:25,793 --> 00:15:27,127
P90X."

357
00:15:34,602 --> 00:15:37,638
The problem with P90X
is that it works.

358
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:41,575
Like, yes,
it will change your body,

359
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:45,646
but only from the neck down.

360
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:48,582
They don't tell you
in the commercial

361
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:53,654
your face stays
exactly the same as it was.

362
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:56,356
"Do you want to have the body
of a 20-year-old Adonis,

363
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,458
"but go ahead and keep the face

364
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:02,195
"of a balding,
middle-aged accountant?

365
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:04,297
"P90X, disappoint your wife
from the chin up

366
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:07,200
on a nightly basis."

367
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:08,602
These guys at P90X,

368
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:09,937
you want to look hot,
just get in shape.

369
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,606
I think women in our country
have too many options

370
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,142
for weight loss
to the point of paralysis.

371
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:16,644
There's so many options.

372
00:16:16,677 --> 00:16:18,712
You go on TV, the Internet,
women's magazines.

373
00:16:18,746 --> 00:16:20,914
There's so many,
you can't even make a choice.

374
00:16:20,948 --> 00:16:22,683
I was reading a women's magazin
e
the other day

375
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:25,418
'cause I wanted to punish myself

376
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:26,654
and just feel awful,

377
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:28,789
and they had
all these diet tips.

378
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,523
Diet tips for ladies.

379
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,159
I saw this one
in "Cosmo."

380
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,695
They suggested that women,
if you're on a diet,

381
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:36,930
"Next time you're on a diet
and you're hungry,

382
00:16:36,964 --> 00:16:38,498
don't ruin the day..."
'Cause your whole day is ruined

383
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:39,767
if you eat a doughnut,
by the way.

384
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,770
You have
to kill yourself immediately.

385
00:16:42,803 --> 00:16:44,638
"Don't ruin the day
by grabbing a fried snack.

386
00:16:44,672 --> 00:16:46,974
Instead, just grab
a handful of almonds."

387
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,109
Just go out... just go and grab
a handful of almonds.

388
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,944
You ever do this?

389
00:16:50,978 --> 00:16:52,545
When you're hungry, you get
a handful of... you don't do that?

390
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:53,647
You don't go up
to the nearest tree

391
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:54,982
and just
giraffe yourself like...

392
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,257
"Cindy, I'll be right there."

393
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,625
Handful of almonds.

394
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:07,060
"Cosmo" says get a handful
of almonds.

395
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:08,495
Just go ahead, get a handful
of almonds, and get a hand...

396
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,763
Why don't you go fuck yourself

397
00:17:09,797 --> 00:17:11,498
with a handful
of almonds, "Cosmo"?

398
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,933
See how full you get off that.

399
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:16,970
I'm a grown woman,
not a sugar squirrel.

400
00:17:17,004 --> 00:17:17,805
Almonds.

401
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:19,873
Juicing.
that's a big thing.

402
00:17:19,907 --> 00:17:21,574
"Why don't you just juice it?
Do you want to just juice?

403
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:23,576
"We should do juices
and smoothies.

404
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:24,945
You wanna make
a smoothie?"

405
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:26,947
You pronounce smoothie like this

406
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,149
'cause you only need this much
of your mouth open to drink it.

407
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:34,321
Smoothie.

408
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:35,555
They want women to do this.

409
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:36,790
Take all your food,
juice it down.

410
00:17:36,824 --> 00:17:38,525
Go get your carrots.
Get your kale.

411
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,694
Don't forget the kale.
Get your kale.

412
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:42,262
Get the apples.
Put it in the juicer.

413
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:43,831
Go ahead and juice the apple
and the celery.

414
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:45,632
Put your hand in the juicer.
Juice your hand down.

415
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:47,100
Juice your hand
right down to the nub.

416
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:48,969
Make sure you juice all of it.
You'll lose 2 ounces.

417
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:51,638
Drink your hand, there's lots
of nutrients in your hand.

418
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,573
"Cosmo" never said
to juice your hand.

419
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:54,307
I'm just gonna
put that out there.

420
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:55,776
Make a smoothie.

421
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:57,510
Do you have time in the morning
to make a smoothie?

422
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:58,578
You have time for this?

423
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:00,680
No?
shocking.

424
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:01,915
You don't have time
in the morning

425
00:18:01,949 --> 00:18:04,718
to go out to your own
personal botanical garden

426
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:06,887
and cut down
a brontosaurus brunch

427
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,455
worth of broccoli and asparagus,

428
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:09,489
juice it down to an ounce,

429
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,191
so you can shit green
for a week?

430
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:12,692
You don't have time?

431
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:17,965
I love being
a stand-up comedian.

432
00:18:17,998 --> 00:18:21,101
It's probably the best job ever.

433
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:22,803
Uh, if I could have any job...

434
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:24,537
If I could have any job,
I would be a cat.

435
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,874
But that is not something

436
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:30,577
I'm supposed
to talk about in public.

437
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,279
If I could have any job
besides this,

438
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:36,549
I know this sounds weird,
but I would be a pharmacist

439
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,618
because I would be...

440
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:40,053
Like, I would add
something cool to it.

441
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:42,489
I would be, like, a different
kind of pharmacist, okay?

442
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:43,690
So I would
do it differently, okay?

443
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:45,692
So... so I would look
like a pharmacist.

444
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:46,927
I would wear the white coat,

445
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,461
'cause without the white coat,

446
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:50,230
you're just a drug dealer.

447
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,601
I'd wear the white coat,
but under it,

448
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:55,836
I would go to, like,
a renaissance fair.

449
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:58,038
- We have renaissance fairs here?
- Yeah.

450
00:18:58,071 --> 00:19:00,107
- Yes! of course we do.
Every state's got white trash.

451
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,811
Of course we do.
So I'd go to a renaissance fair.

452
00:19:03,844 --> 00:19:06,013
And I would go to, like,
the witch doctor's tent.

453
00:19:06,046 --> 00:19:08,916
And I would get one of those,
like, medieval witch woman belts

454
00:19:08,949 --> 00:19:10,717
that has, like, some leather.

455
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,685
And it's got bells
and raccoon pelts

456
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:15,088
and a jug
for your ale, whatever.

457
00:19:15,122 --> 00:19:17,825
And it'd have, like, a jar
of pigeon whisperers.

458
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:19,626
I'd have all these things,
all the accoutrement

459
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,061
of a creepy witch on my belt.

460
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:23,130
And I'd put it under the coat
so that when I walked,

461
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:25,598
the coat would flare open,
and you'd get glimpses

462
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,267
of my medieval trickery
under it.

463
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,069
Just...

464
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:31,038
And you'd be in line
at the pharmacy.

465
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:33,006
And you'd be like, "What's up
with that one pharmacist?"

466
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,774
"Is she into the dark arts?

467
00:19:34,808 --> 00:19:36,643
"Is she a sorceress?
Magic with a 'k'?

468
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,346
Does she play "Skyrim" alone?
What is that?"

469
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:42,850
And I wouldn't come up
to the counter.

470
00:19:42,883 --> 00:19:44,818
Instead... instead of a bell
that you ring,

471
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:46,920
I would get...
I would get a raven.

472
00:19:46,954 --> 00:19:49,222
I would stuff a raven.

473
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:51,758
And I would give it a beard.
I'd glue on the beard.

474
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,293
I would spend my time
gluing the beard on,

475
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:54,962
and it would have a beard, and
I would sit him on the perch,

476
00:19:54,995 --> 00:19:56,830
so when you came up
to the counter,

477
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:58,131
you'd have to pull the beard.

478
00:19:58,165 --> 00:20:02,069
And then the raven will go...

479
00:20:02,102 --> 00:20:04,471
That's my cue to appear.

480
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:08,108
And then I'd... pfft.
Yes?

481
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:10,610
Secretly, I was waiting under
the counter to hear the raven.

482
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:12,980
And then... pfft.
Yes?

483
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:14,314
I was right there.
There's no magic.

484
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:15,348
I'm right there.

485
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,650
Yes, my child?

486
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:19,386
I call you my child

487
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,554
'cause that's what
creepy people do.

488
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:23,023
Yes?

489
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,657
And you'd hand me
your prescription.

490
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:27,794
And I'd say,
"Okay, one moment."

491
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:30,497
And I'd have a hump.
Oh, yeah, I have a hump.

492
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,631
You gotta have a hump.

493
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:32,632
If you're gonna be
making medicine,

494
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,334
you gotta have a hump

495
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:37,504
'cause the hump says
that you're serious.

496
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:38,738
A hump is your calling card.

497
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,740
A hump says,
"I'm not out partying.

498
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:41,875
"I'm not out getting drunk.

499
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:43,877
"I'm downstairs in the basement

500
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:46,980
"studying alchemy and...
And witchery.

501
00:20:47,014 --> 00:20:48,681
"And I'm learning how to turn

502
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:49,816
"newt thoughts
into rat eyeballs.

503
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:51,451
"I'm doing things like that.

504
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:53,786
"I'm learning the proper use
for an Erlenmeyer flask.

505
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,688
I'm down there
doing these things, okay?"

506
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:57,490
So I have the hump, and then...

507
00:20:57,524 --> 00:20:59,626
And then, I'd take your...
I'd take your prescription.

508
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:03,663
And... one moment.

509
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:07,267
I have a limp too...

510
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,635
'Cause the limp

511
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:11,304
comes with the hump, standard.

512
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:15,042
And then I would set to work
making your medicine.

513
00:21:15,075 --> 00:21:17,044
So I'd be back here,
and I would have my back to you.

514
00:21:17,077 --> 00:21:19,146
And I'd... I'd have
all these sound effects

515
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:21,781
on, like, a keyboard ready,
so you would be standing there.

516
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:22,849
And you'd hear like...

517
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,820
"Eh, one moment."

518
00:21:31,191 --> 00:21:34,061
And I would also have
a closed-circuit TV right here,

519
00:21:34,094 --> 00:21:37,264
so I could watch everything
in the pharmacy, okay?

520
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:39,066
So you would go to,
like, touch something,

521
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:40,733
and I would see you on the TV.

522
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,135
And I would just say this,

523
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:45,105
"I wouldn't touch that
if I were you."

524
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:48,041
But I'm just watching you.

525
00:21:48,075 --> 00:21:49,943
And I have...
And, like, an hour later,

526
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:52,545
I'd emerge with your medicine

527
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:53,880
in the orange bottle.

528
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:55,448
Like, I didn't make your shit.

529
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:57,584
I had it ready to go.

530
00:21:57,617 --> 00:22:00,087
I was just wasting your time...

531
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,454
'Cause a hump suggests
that I'm making it,

532
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:03,390
so I want you
to follow that fantasy.

533
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:05,658
I didn't... I don't know how
to make medicine out of herbs.

534
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:06,626
I'm not Chinese.

535
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,630
So I have it.

536
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:11,831
And I'd come up to the counter.

537
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:13,366
And I'd say...
And I'd set it down.

538
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,604
And I'd say, "Would you like
a consultation?"

539
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:21,574
And you'd say, "Sure."
And I'd say, "Okay."

540
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:23,243
And I'd hold up your pill
to the light.

541
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:25,078
I shouldn't touch your medicine,
but I'm going to.

542
00:22:25,112 --> 00:22:27,780
I'd hold it up, and I'd say,
"Take one!"

543
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:29,449
One, one.

544
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:31,618
And I'd have all the other
pharmacists flip the lights

545
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:33,453
on and off to make it...

546
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:34,988
And they'd put lighters up
to the sprinklers.

547
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:36,189
And we'd get
one of the fog machines

548
00:22:36,223 --> 00:22:37,324
left over
from our Halloween sale.

549
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:38,658
And pfft,

550
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:39,959
and it would fill the room.

551
00:22:39,993 --> 00:22:41,995
And we'd have people
wafting it with car mats

552
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:44,697
just to make it go
in some sort of circle.

553
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:47,834
"Take one
on the seventh solstice

554
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,303
of the third
vernal equinox."

555
00:22:50,337 --> 00:22:52,839
It's two different times a year,
but it's just a bit.

556
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:56,743
"Take one in the presence...

557
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:58,311
"Presence of a righteous man

558
00:22:58,345 --> 00:22:59,712
"with the blood of a virgin.

559
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:01,114
"Also with crackers,

560
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:05,018
so you don't upset
your tummy."

561
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:07,020
I give it to you,
and as you are going to leave,

562
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:08,121
you didn't even say anything.

563
00:23:08,155 --> 00:23:09,556
I'd say, "Wait!"

564
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:11,991
I grab you...

565
00:23:12,025 --> 00:23:14,261
Grab you with a grabbing hand.

566
00:23:14,294 --> 00:23:15,995
What's a grabbing hand?
I'm gonna tell you.

567
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:17,397
You can't...
If you're gonna grab someone

568
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,099
and you want to instill fear
in their hearts,

569
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:20,800
you can't grab
with a well-manicured hand

570
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:21,668
with, like, a pretty ring.

571
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:23,270
No one's gonna be afraid.

572
00:23:23,303 --> 00:23:24,571
If I grab you with this hand,
you'd be like, "What?"

573
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:25,872
That sounds awesome."

574
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,140
It's got to be creepy, okay?

575
00:23:27,174 --> 00:23:28,908
Someone grabs you
out of a grave.

576
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:30,510
What does it look like?
it's sinewy.

577
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:32,312
It's got dirty nails.
it's all "thriller" -looking.

578
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:34,747
Just nah!
Gonna grab him.

579
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:35,782
How do you make a grabbing hand?

580
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:36,916
I'm going to tell you.

581
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:38,218
You put your hand
outside your car

582
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,053
for two hours a day,

583
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:43,790
so it tans quicker
than the rest of you.

584
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:45,758
You take special liver pills
that prevent your liver

585
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:47,160
from functioning on this side.

586
00:23:47,194 --> 00:23:50,063
So you start to get liver spots
all over, okay?

587
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:51,364
Now, you gotta make
your fingers creepy.

588
00:23:51,398 --> 00:23:53,066
So maybe...
So this finger...

589
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,701
You've got, like, a coke nail
on that finger.

590
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:57,337
This one's got, like... like,
a raccoon eyeball for a ring.

591
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,172
Maybe this...
You don't need this finger.

592
00:23:59,206 --> 00:24:01,074
You cut this one off totally
'cause you lost it...

593
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:02,642
You lost it in the hobbit bore.

594
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:03,843
I don't care.

595
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:06,146
And then you get a bracelet

596
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:08,815
made of, like, whore gypsy
Kardashian hair.

597
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:10,850
You wrap your hand in it.

598
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,355
And just as you're...
I pull out my grabbing hand.

599
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:18,458
I have it sheathed.
it's sheathed in a sheath.

600
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:20,293
And, uh...

601
00:24:20,327 --> 00:24:22,195
Just as you were leaving,
I'd go, "Wait!"

602
00:24:22,229 --> 00:24:24,063
You'd be,
like, "What?"

603
00:24:24,097 --> 00:24:27,934
And I'd say,
"There's one more thing."

604
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,569
And I'd pull out a hand
of magic dust,

605
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:33,173
which is just sand from the
beach aisle in the pharmacy.

606
00:24:33,206 --> 00:24:35,108
I'd pull...
I'd pull out a hand of dust.

607
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:38,578
And I would just go...

608
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:42,782
"Do you have
a CVS card?"

609
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:57,197
I love walking
around pharmacies.

610
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,865
I love doing that.

611
00:24:58,898 --> 00:25:00,233
I can't... I can't go to
a pharmacy and not spend money.

612
00:25:00,267 --> 00:25:02,034
One of the products
that creeps me out...

613
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:03,636
They have a product
at every pharmacy

614
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,973
called "K-Y Intense."

615
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,875
You seen the commercials
for this thing?

616
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:10,177
The commercial for...
First of all,

617
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,879
the commercial for K-Y Intense
is super offensive.

618
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:13,946
And we will talk about that.

619
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,248
In the c...
First of all,

620
00:25:15,282 --> 00:25:17,116
if you've ever used
K-Y Intense,

621
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,452
you know that it's intense
because it burns.

622
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,222
I will volunteer that.

623
00:25:22,255 --> 00:25:23,823
I accidentally used it
one time thinking, like,

624
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:24,824
"this is gonna
be magical."

625
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,259
And it burned.

626
00:25:26,293 --> 00:25:28,228
And I promise you
girls don't want that.

627
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:29,462
In my life,
I've never been, like,

628
00:25:29,496 --> 00:25:31,264
"man, that sex was awesome.

629
00:25:31,298 --> 00:25:33,065
"But you know what I wanted
to feel, like, right after?

630
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:36,869
Fire."

631
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:39,939
Of course, they don't bill it

632
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:42,008
as a burning sensation on TV.

633
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,075
They call it
"A tingling sensation."

634
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:46,012
And they try to, like, talk
to the girls.

635
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,146
They're like,
"Ladies, do you want

636
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,915
"more pleasure
out of your three minutes?

637
00:25:48,948 --> 00:25:50,149
Do you want that?
Okay."

638
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,320
"Well, K-Y Intense
is great

639
00:25:53,353 --> 00:25:55,121
"'cause it's a tingling
sensation for her

640
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:56,689
"and he gets to use his penis.

641
00:25:56,723 --> 00:26:00,193
So everybody wins."

642
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:02,262
But even if it...
Even if it was

643
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:04,364
a tingling sensation,
we live in a society

644
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:06,766
preconditioned to not
want tingling.

645
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,335
We don't like tingling.

646
00:26:08,368 --> 00:26:10,470
We know that tingling, it means
a bad thing is happening.

647
00:26:10,503 --> 00:26:12,939
"Hey, everyone, grandma says
her arm is tingling."

648
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:14,774
"Oh, she must be having
an orgasm."

649
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:19,879
"You don't have to rush her
to the hospital.

650
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,180
"She's laying on the ground

651
00:26:21,214 --> 00:26:22,315
"with her eyes rolled back
in her head.

652
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:25,252
She's clearly
enjoying herself."

653
00:26:25,285 --> 00:26:28,154
Tingling.
it's horrible.

654
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:29,188
You ever hit your funny bone
and been, like...

655
00:26:29,222 --> 00:26:30,590
"Ahh."

656
00:26:32,492 --> 00:26:36,162
The commercial is awful
because it's two British people.

657
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:38,531
And they're sitting there
having breakfast.

658
00:26:38,565 --> 00:26:39,999
And they're discussing
all the sex

659
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:42,569
that they had
the night before...

660
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:45,438
'Cause they used
the K-Y Intense.

661
00:26:45,472 --> 00:26:47,640
But because the Brits are very
tacit about sexual things,

662
00:26:47,674 --> 00:26:49,842
they're not coming right out
and discussing it.

663
00:26:49,876 --> 00:26:50,977
They're speaking in code.

664
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,044
And at the bottom of the screen

665
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:55,147
are the subtitles in American

666
00:26:55,181 --> 00:26:56,549
so we can understand
what they're saying.

667
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:58,084
So they're sitting there,
and they're eating.

668
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,620
They're having
their... porridge.

669
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:04,591
They're eating
their curds and whey.

670
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:07,694
I don't care what the Brits eat.
We won the war, so there.

671
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:09,996
Right?

672
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:11,731
So they're sitting there.
And they're eating it.

673
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:14,967
And it's just very quiet.
And they're just...

674
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:29,248
Teeth out to here.

675
00:27:35,455 --> 00:27:39,459
And the girl looks at the guy.

676
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:42,028
"Wonderful dessert
last night, sire."

677
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:45,197
She didn't say "sire."

678
00:27:45,231 --> 00:27:46,399
They don't talk
like that anymore.

679
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:50,169
So she talks,
and there's subtitles.

680
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:51,771
"Wonderful dessert
last night."

681
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:53,940
"Hey! What'd you put
on my puss, nigga?"

682
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:57,910
And then the guy...

683
00:27:57,944 --> 00:27:59,379
Responds in kind.

684
00:27:59,412 --> 00:28:01,113
He's like, "Oh, yes, 'twas..."

685
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:02,081
"'Twas a bit of a new recipe.

686
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:03,516
Hoped you liked it."

687
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,485
"Put some of that K-Y shit
on my dick, bitch.

688
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,454
How you like me now?"

689
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:12,792
And then, the girl is,
like, "Oh, yes."

690
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:15,161
'Twas quite invigorating.
Didn't expect that one."

691
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,563
"You fucking kidding me
with that shit?

692
00:28:16,596 --> 00:28:18,331
"What'd you put?
Ants on your dick?

693
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:20,232
Is this a joke?"

694
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:21,668
"You want
to fucking die, motherfucker?

695
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:24,003
"You want to end up on snap?
I'll fucking kill you.

696
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,071
This fuckin' hurt."

697
00:28:25,104 --> 00:28:28,508
Then the guy, like, "Oh, yes",

698
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,042
"tried a spin on an old recipe.

699
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:31,744
Tried a dash
of nutmeg."

700
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:34,547
And there were
no subtitles for that

701
00:28:34,581 --> 00:28:36,349
because I think
they fucking do use nutmeg.

702
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:37,984
And that's what makes it
burn so much.

703
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:46,058
I know a lot about sex
and dating.

704
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:46,993
I know a lot about dating

705
00:28:47,026 --> 00:28:48,961
because I watch a lot of dates.

706
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,331
That sounds creepy.
I host a dating show.

707
00:28:52,365 --> 00:28:54,000
So I've learned a lot
about men and women

708
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:55,435
and their interactions.

709
00:28:55,468 --> 00:28:57,504
And one important thing
that I've learned

710
00:28:57,537 --> 00:29:00,940
is that when you like someone
and you want to impress them,

711
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:02,308
what do you do?

712
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:04,343
You lie.

713
00:29:04,377 --> 00:29:06,513
You have to,
because if people knew

714
00:29:06,546 --> 00:29:08,014
how weird you were
in your off time,

715
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:10,550
no one would have you.

716
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,385
A guy says to you, "What do
you like to do for fun?"

717
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:14,186
Girls, you can't be honest.

718
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,523
You can't be honest
about that shit.

719
00:29:16,556 --> 00:29:18,290
You can't be honest
about what you were doing

720
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:20,292
10 minutes before you came
to the door.

721
00:29:20,326 --> 00:29:21,428
You have to lie.

722
00:29:21,461 --> 00:29:22,929
"What do you like
to do for fun?"

723
00:29:22,962 --> 00:29:23,963
You can't tell him.

724
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:25,364
You can't be, like,
"I really enjoy

725
00:29:25,398 --> 00:29:27,066
"choreographing naked
cheerleading routines

726
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,435
"to old Britney Spears CDs.

727
00:29:28,468 --> 00:29:30,470
"And then, I Google
a bunch of Hentai porn,

728
00:29:30,503 --> 00:29:32,104
"masturbate, don't wash
my hands,

729
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:33,740
"Facebook stalk my ex-boyfriend
and his ex-girlfriends,

730
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:35,475
"jot down their place of
employment for future reference.

731
00:29:35,508 --> 00:29:37,243
"And then, I go
bake some cookies.

732
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:38,611
"And then,
I mouth-kiss my dog

733
00:29:38,645 --> 00:29:40,012
and promise her that one day
she'll be my wife."

734
00:29:40,046 --> 00:29:42,415
You can't say that.

735
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:44,517
Nine times out of ten,
a guy asks a girl,

736
00:29:44,551 --> 00:29:46,285
"What do you like to do
for fun?"

737
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:48,688
The girl's answer
will be, "Hiking."

738
00:29:53,993 --> 00:29:55,361
"I love hiking.
I do.

739
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:57,029
I do... don't I?
I do. I love hiking."

740
00:29:58,531 --> 00:29:59,799
"I do, hiking's..."

741
00:29:59,832 --> 00:30:00,833
"I love hiking."

742
00:30:03,536 --> 00:30:05,204
"I do. I love it.
I love hiking."

743
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:06,706
"No, you don't.
Stop lying.

744
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:08,641
"You don't like... really, Stacy?
You like hiking?

745
00:30:08,675 --> 00:30:11,277
"Where are your trail spikes?
Where's your walking stick?

746
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,412
Where's your lesbian
mountain partner?"

747
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:16,015
You don't like hiking.

748
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:17,650
You don't even know
what hiking is.

749
00:30:17,684 --> 00:30:20,386
Most modern girls don't really
know what hiking is, okay?

750
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:22,288
To the average girl, hiking is

751
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,422
you wake up whenever you want,

752
00:30:23,456 --> 00:30:25,057
you put on Lululemon yoga pants

753
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:27,426
'cause they make your butt
look unreasonably good

754
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,463
as they should
for 800 fucking dollars.

755
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:32,364
And you go for a walk
in the park

756
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:33,265
with your best friend
and complain

757
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:34,634
about how hung over you are.

758
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:39,105
That's hiking.

759
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:41,508
Yeah.
I do it too.

760
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:42,909
Promise you this, girls.

761
00:30:42,942 --> 00:30:44,744
It's not a sport
if you can drink a Starbucks

762
00:30:44,777 --> 00:30:47,213
and have a pita
while you're doing it.

763
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:48,314
"Do you want
a piece of pita?"

764
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,583
"I'm hiking."

765
00:30:50,617 --> 00:30:52,351
But there's a method
to our madness.

766
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:54,386
There's a reason women
say "hiking."

767
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,624
We say hiking because we think
guys like hiking.

768
00:30:57,657 --> 00:30:58,891
That's why we're doing it.

769
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:00,126
Be outside where the bugs are?

770
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,894
No!
we think you like that.

771
00:31:01,928 --> 00:31:04,396
We're taught to believe
that men are outdoorsy,

772
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,365
and rugged,
and they like nature.

773
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:08,100
As far as we're concerned,

774
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:11,838
you're the closest thing
we know to a bear.

775
00:31:13,606 --> 00:31:15,341
So we say hiking, hoping to have

776
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:16,208
something in common with you.

777
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:17,644
We honestly say "hiking"

778
00:31:17,677 --> 00:31:19,546
hoping that you'll be,
like, "you like hiking?"

779
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:24,651
I like hiking.
Marry me."

780
00:31:24,684 --> 00:31:26,485
It's the easiest thing
you can say that you do.

781
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:28,287
It's one of the only
outdoor activities

782
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,322
that you can lie
and say that you do it

783
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:32,124
having never done it before,

784
00:31:32,158 --> 00:31:36,428
and then do it and pull it off
because it's walking.

785
00:31:36,462 --> 00:31:38,330
You can't pull that off,

786
00:31:38,364 --> 00:31:40,800
you shouldn't be mating
with anyone.

787
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:42,234
You ca...
Most outdoor activities

788
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:43,970
require a decent amount
of skill.

789
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:46,639
For example, you can't say
you like rock climbing

790
00:31:46,673 --> 00:31:48,608
if you've never been
rock climbing.

791
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:51,477
I mean, you can,
but I promise you this.

792
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,847
You're gonna go.
You're gonna slip.

793
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:57,617
You're gonna get your hand
caught in a rock.

794
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:01,287
127 hours later...

795
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,060
Stump's not getting you
a second date.

796
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:09,862
I promise you that.

797
00:32:09,896 --> 00:32:11,530
I don't know if girls
wanna hear this,

798
00:32:11,564 --> 00:32:13,666
but the truth is
90% of the activities

799
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,034
that women engage in

800
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:17,604
revolve around getting
a guy's attention, okay?

801
00:32:17,637 --> 00:32:19,538
And it's just the way
we're built biologically.

802
00:32:19,572 --> 00:32:21,307
This is just something we do.

803
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,609
We love to get your attention.

804
00:32:22,642 --> 00:32:24,443
it's part of the sport of it,
all right?

805
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:25,745
You think I go to a sports bar

806
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:27,446
because I like warm beer
and sticky barstools?

807
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:29,081
No. I go 'cause there's
guys there.

808
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:30,449
You think I do a pub crawl
every year

809
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:31,784
'cause I like it
when my liver hurts?

810
00:32:31,818 --> 00:32:33,519
No! I go 'cause there's
guys there.

811
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:34,654
We don't wear heels
for our circulation.

812
00:32:34,687 --> 00:32:36,155
We do it to prop up our butt

813
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:38,124
so you'll look at me
and want to mate with me.

814
00:32:38,157 --> 00:32:39,525
That's why we do it.

815
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:40,860
This isn't a fucking game,
all right?

816
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:42,561
This isn't a push-up bra.
it's body armor.

817
00:32:42,595 --> 00:32:43,863
And this ain't
makeup, sweetheart.

818
00:32:43,896 --> 00:32:46,098
it's war paint.
Let's make a baby.

819
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:58,010
Girls know exactly
what they're doing.

820
00:32:58,044 --> 00:32:59,779
We know exactly what you like,
what you don't like.

821
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:01,547
We do our research
when we like a guy.

822
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,016
And by research,
I mean we Facebook stalk you.

823
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,918
We do it.

824
00:33:05,952 --> 00:33:07,319
I know your favorite foods.

825
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:08,554
I know
where you went on vacation.

826
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:10,589
I know that your favorite team
is the Cowboys.

827
00:33:10,623 --> 00:33:12,391
I know all about that.
I'm totally into you.

828
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:13,693
That's right.

829
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:15,628
They say men are hunters
and women are gatherers.

830
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:17,664
Well, kind of.
Women are gatherers.

831
00:33:17,697 --> 00:33:19,398
We like to gather information
about you.

832
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:22,001
And then we hunt you.

833
00:33:22,034 --> 00:33:24,570
You think when I bring you home
to meet mom on Christmas

834
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:25,972
it's 'cause I want her
to meet you?

835
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:28,841
No, it's so I can be, like,
"Mom, look what I caught."

836
00:33:31,577 --> 00:33:33,412
We have to, because guys
are kind of passive

837
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:34,914
when it comes to meeting women.

838
00:33:34,947 --> 00:33:36,816
Sure, they go out.
But girls make a sport of it.

839
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:38,617
My guy friends don't care.

840
00:33:38,651 --> 00:33:39,686
If they had their way,
they'd spend

841
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:41,620
every saturday night
with each other...

842
00:33:41,654 --> 00:33:43,790
Which is weird...
Watching "1000 ways to die,"

843
00:33:43,823 --> 00:33:45,591
eating sandwiches,
ragging on their one friend

844
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:46,926
that has a huge nut sack
for no reason.

845
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:49,495
Like, that's what they would do.

846
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,898
Going out's very important.

847
00:33:51,931 --> 00:33:53,800
You got a real job, your weekend
is very important to you,

848
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:55,768
because a weekend represents
48 hours

849
00:33:55,802 --> 00:33:58,537
that you have
to fuck up the life

850
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,807
that you worked so hard for
all week.

851
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:06,746
That's what your weekend is.

852
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:08,380
If you're a real professional,

853
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:11,784
your weekend starts thursday
at, like, 5:00 P.M.

854
00:34:11,818 --> 00:34:13,652
Right?
you go to happy hour.

855
00:34:13,686 --> 00:34:14,653
Happy hour trickles
into, like, nighttime.

856
00:34:14,687 --> 00:34:16,255
You're drinking a little bit

857
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:18,657
'cause you can go to work
a little hung over, right?

858
00:34:18,691 --> 00:34:20,492
No one's doing real work
on friday.

859
00:34:20,526 --> 00:34:22,729
Nobody's working on a friday.

860
00:34:22,762 --> 00:34:24,163
Nobody's working on a friday
'cause it's what?

861
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:25,597
Shabbat. No.

862
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:28,067
Because it's friday
and nobody cares.

863
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,202
You ever been at work, your boss
is never gonna be, like,

864
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:32,772
"Let's get in those reports
and start brainstorming."

865
00:34:32,805 --> 00:34:34,073
You're, like,
"Okay, I'll be there."

866
00:34:36,776 --> 00:34:38,577
"Oh, you were serious?
Okay, little hand job.

867
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,345
I'll be at my desk.
That's fine."

868
00:34:42,648 --> 00:34:44,216
Girls take going out
very seriously

869
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,385
'cause that's
our hunting grounds.

870
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,020
"Going out.
Let's do it."

871
00:34:50,022 --> 00:34:52,458
"Do you want to do,
like, a girls' night?

872
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:54,827
Do you wanna
do that?"

873
00:34:54,861 --> 00:34:56,528
Every weekend, I get calls
from my girlfriends.

874
00:34:56,562 --> 00:34:58,030
"Do you want to do,
like, just girls?

875
00:34:58,064 --> 00:35:00,566
"Do you want to do,
like, a fun girls' night?

876
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,667
Iliza, I'm talking to you.
Iliza."

877
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,169
"Do you want to do that?"

878
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,169
"DO YOU WANT TO DO THAT?"

879
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,537
"Do you wanna do,

880
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:06,806
"like, a girls'...
We'll just do...

881
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:08,007
"Oh, we'll all wear,
like, fun shoes.

882
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,876
"And we'll all get, like, Apis.

883
00:35:09,909 --> 00:35:10,943
And then, we'll do,
like, a fun girls' night."

884
00:35:10,977 --> 00:35:12,111
"Do you wanna do that?

885
00:35:12,144 --> 00:35:13,512
"I wanna do a girls' night.

886
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:15,081
I made an evite
for the four of us."

887
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:18,918
"You didn't answer."

888
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:20,419
"'Cause I'm standing
right here."

889
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,989
"You're such a bitch."

890
00:35:23,022 --> 00:35:24,056
"Let's do a girls' night.
Let's do just girls.

891
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,691
"No boys.

892
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:28,227
Let's just all wear wedges
and no boys."

893
00:35:30,096 --> 00:35:32,331
"Let's not do boys, just girls.
Just the girls."

894
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:34,333
I'm like, "Why?"

895
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:37,369
We hate each other."

896
00:35:37,403 --> 00:35:38,805
Girls hate each other.

897
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:41,073
Esp... she hates you,
especially during the day.

898
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:45,577
But when the moon comes up
and there's white wine involved,

899
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:49,281
"Oh, my God.
Stacy, you look amazing.

900
00:35:49,315 --> 00:35:51,818
I fucking love you."

901
00:35:51,851 --> 00:35:53,219
And you notice
the drunker you get,

902
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:55,554
the more Spanish
you start speaking?

903
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:58,357
"Oh, my God.
Mamacita, muy caliente.

904
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,526
Whoo!"

905
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:04,696
"Fucking love you, chica."

906
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,165
But the more love you give
to one girlfriend,

907
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:09,902
the more love you must taketh
away from another girlfriend.

908
00:36:09,936 --> 00:36:11,838
It's how we keep balance
in the girl universe.

909
00:36:11,871 --> 00:36:14,573
"I love you.
Can I just tell you?"

910
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:16,976
"I love you, I do."

911
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,377
"But you know who I hate?"

912
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:23,515
"Becky."

913
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:25,852
"She's a bitch."

914
00:36:25,885 --> 00:36:28,754
"No, I hate her
even though she drove me here

915
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:31,190
and I'm wearing
her top."

916
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:35,661
"Can I just tell you that?

917
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:36,795
"Like, for real,
like, I hate her.

918
00:36:36,829 --> 00:36:38,898
"Will you not tell her?
Do you promise?

919
00:36:38,931 --> 00:36:40,900
"Do you... do you prom...
You won't tell her?

920
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:42,134
"Do you pinky swear?

921
00:36:42,168 --> 00:36:43,702
"Do you pinky s...
Do you pinky swear?

922
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:44,770
"Even though
I'm a grown fucking woman

923
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:46,205
"that pays taxes and votes,

924
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:49,675
do you wanna pinky swear?"

925
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,377
"This is ironclad.
Do you pinky swear?

926
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:52,879
"Okay, come here.
No, here, take my hand.

927
00:36:52,912 --> 00:36:55,915
"I wanna talk to you.
Come here.

928
00:36:55,948 --> 00:36:58,150
"No, like, earlier, like...
Here, come here, come here.

929
00:36:58,184 --> 00:37:00,119
"Like, earlier, she was just,
like, being, like, a bitch.

930
00:37:00,152 --> 00:37:01,720
"And I was, like,
'What's your problem?

931
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:04,156
I don't even understand.'"

932
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,624
"Now, she's like, 'Why
are you being, like, so rude?"

933
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:08,260
'And, like... what, are you, like,
bipolar or, like, manic?

934
00:37:08,294 --> 00:37:10,496
'Like I just freely use
these psychological terms

935
00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:11,964
'cause I don't know
what I'm talking about.'

936
00:37:11,998 --> 00:37:14,266
"and she was, like, being,
like... wait, wait."

937
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,268
"Is she looking?"

938
00:37:16,302 --> 00:37:18,104
"Did she hear me talking
about her?"

939
00:37:18,137 --> 00:37:20,339
"Is she... pretend like we're
not talking about her."

940
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:23,809
"Is she gone?"

941
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:25,144
"No, but,
like, that's the thing."

942
00:37:25,177 --> 00:37:26,946
"Like, earlier, she was just,
like, being,"

943
00:37:26,979 --> 00:37:30,582
"like, passive-aggressive
and, like, crazy."

944
00:37:30,616 --> 00:37:32,384
"And, like..."

945
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:34,086
"And I was just, like..."

946
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,821
"She was just being,
like, a freak."

947
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:37,323
"And she was just,
like, disrespecting me."

948
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:41,393
"And, like... no, no, like,
when you do it, it's fine."

949
00:37:44,163 --> 00:37:46,232
"Right?

950
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:49,969
Because we get each other
'cause we're both pisces."

951
00:37:50,002 --> 00:37:51,737
Which means nothing.

952
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,472
"Do you wanna do that?

953
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:54,840
"Do you wanna do a girls night?

954
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:56,208
"Fuck yeah.
Why don't you come over?

955
00:37:56,242 --> 00:37:58,077
"'US Weekly',
Jennifer Aniston, hang out,

956
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,678
"Love actually, '
watch a movie, braid our hair,

957
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:01,013
stiff as a board, "Light
as a feather, have some candy",

958
00:38:01,047 --> 00:38:02,949
"have some cake,
have some cookies,

959
00:38:02,982 --> 00:38:04,216
"have some box wine,
have some fucking Martinis,

960
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,918
"and a low-fat pizza.
Have a goddamn muffin,

961
00:38:05,952 --> 00:38:07,486
"have a piece of cake,
have a piece of brownie,

962
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:09,088
'Fifty Shades of Grey.'"
"Sounds great, Cindy.

963
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:10,889
"Can't wait to be shit-faced
on your couch"

964
00:38:10,923 --> 00:38:12,524
"at 2:00 A.M. with no boy
to make out with."

965
00:38:12,558 --> 00:38:14,994
"You got 'Grey's Anatomy'
on DVD? Awesome."

966
00:38:15,027 --> 00:38:17,997
"Pop it in. Let's lez out.
Where's your brother?"

967
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:28,874
Yeah.
let's make that happen.

968
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:30,742
Tired of feeling
like a sexual deviant

969
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:32,011
'cause I just enjoy a little bit

970
00:38:32,044 --> 00:38:35,147
of mouth-kissing
with my red wine, okay?

971
00:38:35,181 --> 00:38:36,949
Look, that's what most girls
want, by the way.

972
00:38:36,983 --> 00:38:38,884
We just wanna make out,
just a little bit.

973
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:39,785
Right at the beginning
when you first meet,

974
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:40,919
they want to make out.

975
00:38:40,953 --> 00:38:41,954
That's what most girls want.

976
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:43,389
"I wanna do some fun shoes,

977
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:45,624
red wine, make out,
weiner touch, go to bed."

978
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,659
That's what we want...

979
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:48,727
When you first meet someone.

980
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,928
Look, let's not
get crazy, right?

981
00:38:49,962 --> 00:38:51,763
Just make out, and...

982
00:38:51,797 --> 00:38:54,700
And then that's it.

983
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:56,735
Just real quick, in that order.

984
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,836
You don't want
to have drunk sex.

985
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,505
That's a whole mess.

986
00:38:59,538 --> 00:39:01,974
Drunk sex, there's emotions,
ankle sprains, paper work.

987
00:39:02,008 --> 00:39:06,145
There's, like,
a whole thing involved.

988
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:07,946
Girls like making out.

989
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,748
It's a sentiment
echoed by almost any girl

990
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,317
in any bar on any night.

991
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,985
You pick any bar in the country.

992
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:14,586
You find a girl,
she's gonna be drunk,

993
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,654
face on sideways, just, like...

994
00:39:19,158 --> 00:39:21,727
"I just want to make out
with a boy.

995
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,029
"I just want to make out
with a boy.

996
00:39:23,062 --> 00:39:25,797
"I do, I just want to make out
with some boy.

997
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:28,100
That's all I want."

998
00:39:28,134 --> 00:39:29,768
"I do.
I'm pretty, right?"

999
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:35,974
"I just want..."

1000
00:39:40,846 --> 00:39:45,551
"Saved it."

1001
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:46,785
That's what you hear.

1002
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:48,020
You rarely hear a girl talk

1003
00:39:48,054 --> 00:39:49,755
about having sex
with a stranger.

1004
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:51,423
I understand it happens.

1005
00:39:51,457 --> 00:39:52,791
I understand
that there's one-night stands.

1006
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:54,226
But rarely does a girl go out

1007
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,795
with the intention of having sex
with a stranger.

1008
00:39:56,828 --> 00:39:58,064
Rarely do you hear a girl, like,

1009
00:39:58,097 --> 00:40:01,200
"I just want to, like, go out,
and, like, party,

1010
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:02,501
"and, like, meet some dude,
and go home with him,

1011
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:03,835
"and then have sex with him,
and then wake up,

1012
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:05,171
"and realize
I never got his name.

1013
00:40:05,204 --> 00:40:06,572
"But he's already gone
to the gym.

1014
00:40:06,605 --> 00:40:07,739
"So I can't ask him.

1015
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:08,940
"So I go over
to his coffee table,

1016
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:10,142
"and I find a phone bill
with his name on it.

1017
00:40:10,176 --> 00:40:11,510
"And I put it in my pocket,

1018
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:12,478
and I go home
with the phone bill."

1019
00:40:14,146 --> 00:40:16,115
"And I get home to my computer,
and I take it out."

1020
00:40:16,148 --> 00:40:18,217
"I'm like, 'Brian Williamson.
That's a generic fucking name.'"

1021
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,052
"So I look up all 90,000
Brian Williamsons on Facebook"

1022
00:40:20,086 --> 00:40:21,287
"until I find the one
that resembles him."

1023
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,688
"And then,
I send him a message."

1024
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:24,290
"But I have to use bait"

1025
00:40:24,323 --> 00:40:25,824
"'cause I have to make sure
he'll write me back."

1026
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:27,393
"So I'm like,
'I think I'm pregnant.'"

1027
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:29,695
"he writes back.
'J-K, mother fucker.'"

1028
00:40:29,728 --> 00:40:31,897
'but I got you now.'

1029
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,300
"now, we begin
the dance of seduction."

1030
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:36,068
"Now, I say things,
like, 'I just wanna be friends."

1031
00:40:36,102 --> 00:40:38,036
'You were super fun
to have sex with.

1032
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,171
'Let's just be friends
and have sex.

1033
00:40:39,205 --> 00:40:40,772
'Fuck a relationship
and oxytocin.

1034
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:42,007
'I never wanna have a family.

1035
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,442
Let's just do
what you wanna do.'

1036
00:40:43,475 --> 00:40:46,078
he's into it.
So I get your number, right?

1037
00:40:46,112 --> 00:40:48,114
You hold onto the number
until you have an occasion.

1038
00:40:48,147 --> 00:40:49,715
And then,
it's like St. Patrick's day.

1039
00:40:49,748 --> 00:40:52,584
You send out a mass text,
but it's just to one person.

1040
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:54,253
You ever do that?

1041
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:59,658
Me neither.
It was just a joke.

1042
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:00,759
It's the best idea.

1043
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,494
You find one guy that you like.

1044
00:41:02,528 --> 00:41:04,196
And you send out a text
that's, like, "Hey, everyone."

1045
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:06,298
Make sure you write
"everyone" in caps

1046
00:41:06,332 --> 00:41:07,999
so it's clear that it's
for, like, a bunch of people.

1047
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:10,035
"Hey, everyone, L-O-L."

1048
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:12,771
"Whatever, smiley face,
I'm gonna have a party

1049
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,173
"at Kelly's bar
at 9:00 P.M.

1050
00:41:14,206 --> 00:41:15,974
Everybody should come,
you guys."

1051
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:17,309
Triple "z" so he knows

1052
00:41:17,343 --> 00:41:18,744
there's a lot of people
in this text.

1053
00:41:18,777 --> 00:41:19,878
"Okay, see you later."

1054
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:21,213
And then you bring
your one friend

1055
00:41:21,247 --> 00:41:22,881
that has no issue
with you ditching her.

1056
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:23,882
You go to the bar,
and you post up,

1057
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:25,083
and you wait
until he gets there.

1058
00:41:25,117 --> 00:41:26,385
He shows up.

1059
00:41:26,418 --> 00:41:28,019
You're like,
"I guess everybody passed out.

1060
00:41:28,053 --> 00:41:29,721
It's just us standing."

1061
00:41:29,755 --> 00:41:31,223
And then, you make out.

1062
00:41:31,257 --> 00:41:32,424
And he's, like,
"You seem like a cool chick."

1063
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:33,692
You're, like,
"I'm the coolest chick.

1064
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:35,127
I wanna fucking
do it."

1065
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:36,895
And he's, like, "Let's go out
tomorrow night."

1066
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:37,929
You're like,
"Yeah, a second date.

1067
00:41:37,963 --> 00:41:39,064
"It only took me
six fucking months.

1068
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:40,766
Yeah."

1069
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:42,901
So now, you're excited
'cause you have a second date.

1070
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:44,102
And girls love getting ready
for dates.

1071
00:41:44,136 --> 00:41:45,504
Even though it makes us
a little nauseous

1072
00:41:45,537 --> 00:41:46,605
and all we wanna do
is stay home and eat,

1073
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:48,240
we love second dates

1074
00:41:48,274 --> 00:41:49,608
'cause you got to get ready
for your second date.

1075
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:50,942
So what do you do?

1076
00:41:50,976 --> 00:41:52,278
You do your hair,
you do your makeup,

1077
00:41:52,311 --> 00:41:55,214
you shave your big toe.

1078
00:41:58,684 --> 00:42:00,186
You come to play, right?

1079
00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:01,353
Gotta make sure
your underwear's cute.

1080
00:42:01,387 --> 00:42:03,289
Don't wanna go
to Victoria's Secret

1081
00:42:03,322 --> 00:42:04,690
'cause that's a bit too much
of a commitment.

1082
00:42:04,723 --> 00:42:07,859
So where do you go for a cheap
bra that's really cute?

1083
00:42:07,893 --> 00:42:11,129
Target.

1084
00:42:11,163 --> 00:42:12,298
They don't fit,
and you're like, "Fuck it."

1085
00:42:12,331 --> 00:42:14,032
"For $12.50,
I'll wear a bra

1086
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:15,701
"made of ceiling insulation
and barbed wire.

1087
00:42:15,734 --> 00:42:17,803
That's fine."

1088
00:42:17,836 --> 00:42:19,104
"It doesn't fit this boob,

1089
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:20,372
"and it makes this nipple
fall asleep.

1090
00:42:20,406 --> 00:42:23,442
But for 12 bucks,
I'm good."

1091
00:42:23,475 --> 00:42:25,544
You get all excited.
You put on makeup.

1092
00:42:25,577 --> 00:42:27,646
You put on the makeup that
you're okay with sleeping in.

1093
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:29,481
All girls have
to make this decision

1094
00:42:29,515 --> 00:42:31,149
'cause you know you're not
gonna be washing your face

1095
00:42:31,183 --> 00:42:33,219
because girls are so fucked up
that we think,

1096
00:42:33,252 --> 00:42:35,086
"I'd rather fall asleep,
get night zits,

1097
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,457
"and wake up looking
like a melted clown

1098
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:41,126
than ever wash my face and show
him that I'm a human being."

1099
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:43,028
So you go there.
You're all excited.

1100
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,363
You get to his house.
You guys start drinking.

1101
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:47,132
You get so fucking wasted
in the first two hours

1102
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:48,166
that you have sex
for three minutes

1103
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,301
before he goes completely soft.

1104
00:42:49,335 --> 00:42:51,102
And the next thing you know,

1105
00:42:51,136 --> 00:42:52,571
you wake up in your underwear
on his couch.

1106
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:53,872
You look over,
he's eating noodles,

1107
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,073
watching "Harry Potter."

1108
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:57,543
Is this relatable
to anyone else?

1109
00:43:00,279 --> 00:43:02,281
Popular misconception
about girls

1110
00:43:02,314 --> 00:43:04,716
is that we get drunk
and we wanna have sex.

1111
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,151
Here's the truth.

1112
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:08,454
We do.
Have a good night.

1113
00:43:08,487 --> 00:43:10,922
No.

1114
00:43:10,956 --> 00:43:14,293
We do for, like, the first hour
of being drunk, okay?

1115
00:43:14,326 --> 00:43:16,762
Let's talk about the first hour
of being drunk

1116
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:21,099
mostly because many of you
are in that hour right now.

1117
00:43:21,132 --> 00:43:23,969
I call it
"the witching hour."

1118
00:43:24,002 --> 00:43:25,070
The first hour of being drunk

1119
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:27,339
is the best hour of the night

1120
00:43:27,373 --> 00:43:30,141
because your buzz is fresh.

1121
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,744
You're happy.
You don't feel fat.

1122
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:36,214
You haven't cried yet.

1123
00:43:36,248 --> 00:43:37,749
You're still somewhat
of the self you were

1124
00:43:37,783 --> 00:43:38,950
when you were sober.

1125
00:43:38,984 --> 00:43:41,387
You still could ostensibly
operate heavy machinery

1126
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:44,256
if an emergency
were to arise, okay?

1127
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:46,325
You're in that buzz.
You're feeling awesome.

1128
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:48,427
Your synapses haven't been
soaked in alcohol.

1129
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,228
So you're still alert.
You're feeling awesome.

1130
00:43:50,262 --> 00:43:51,830
You walk into that bar
like you own it.

1131
00:43:51,863 --> 00:43:54,266
You fucking kick that door open
even though it's a pull-in door.

1132
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,834
You don't care.
You're just...

1133
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:57,369
Walk in.

1134
00:43:57,403 --> 00:44:01,473
"Let's do shots, bitches."

1135
00:44:01,507 --> 00:44:02,841
You and your awful friends
line up at the bar.

1136
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:04,376
Like, "Let's do shots."

1137
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:06,378
You're doing shots
you have no business doing.

1138
00:44:06,412 --> 00:44:09,348
"Let's get Jagermeister,
Goldschlager,

1139
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:11,082
"Rumple Minze, aftershock.

1140
00:44:11,116 --> 00:44:12,384
"Do you have anything else

1141
00:44:12,418 --> 00:44:14,820
that tastes like Christmas
and vomit?"

1142
00:44:20,258 --> 00:44:21,560
You start doing them.
You're like, "Fuck it."

1143
00:44:21,593 --> 00:44:23,395
"it's my Bachelorette,
21st birthday,"

1144
00:44:23,429 --> 00:44:25,564
"wedding extravaganza,
donkey punch."

1145
00:44:25,597 --> 00:44:27,098
"I don't know what this is...
Do it."

1146
00:44:27,132 --> 00:44:28,867
Shot, shot.

1147
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:32,103
"What is that, hand soap?
Bubbles. I don't care. Awesome."

1148
00:44:32,137 --> 00:44:33,238
Now, you're on the dance floor.

1149
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:35,073
You're like,
"This is so good."

1150
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:36,908
And you're feeling so good,
right? You're dancing.

1151
00:44:36,942 --> 00:44:38,610
You're all excited 'cause
your buzz has just hit you.

1152
00:44:38,644 --> 00:44:39,978
You're like, "this is great.
I fucking love it."

1153
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,480
You're ambitious about life.

1154
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:44,650
You ever plan a workout
when you're drunk?

1155
00:44:44,683 --> 00:44:47,519
When you're drunk, you're, like,
"This is when I get in shape.

1156
00:44:47,553 --> 00:44:49,020
"This is where it starts.

1157
00:44:49,054 --> 00:44:50,221
Going to start tomorrow."

1158
00:44:50,255 --> 00:44:51,222
You try to drag your friends
into it.

1159
00:44:51,256 --> 00:44:53,459
You're like,
"Stacy! Sta..."

1160
00:44:53,492 --> 00:44:54,826
"Stacy."

1161
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:58,229
"Do you wanna work out?"

1162
00:44:58,263 --> 00:44:59,398
You dance like an asshole,
by the way.

1163
00:44:59,431 --> 00:45:01,299
I don't know
who dances like this.

1164
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:03,034
"Do you wanna work out,
like, tomorrow?

1165
00:45:03,068 --> 00:45:04,169
"Do you wanna do that?

1166
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:05,170
"I'm gonna get up early
and work out.

1167
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:06,304
"Do you wanna go with me?

1168
00:45:06,338 --> 00:45:07,806
"Do you want to go
at, like, 6:00?

1169
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:12,043
It's 5:00 now."

1170
00:45:12,077 --> 00:45:13,812
"Do you wanna take
a spin class?"

1171
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:15,113
"Do you wanna spin?"

1172
00:45:15,146 --> 00:45:17,282
"Do you wanna..."

1173
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:18,550
"Do you want...
You don't wanna spin?

1174
00:45:18,584 --> 00:45:20,352
"You don't wanna go spinning?

1175
00:45:20,386 --> 00:45:21,787
"You don't wanna sit
on a stationary bike

1176
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:24,356
"and tolerate getting pounded
in the rectum for an hour

1177
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:26,825
"while some twinked-out
spandex queen yells at you

1178
00:45:26,858 --> 00:45:29,027
"over a shitty remix of U2's
'It's a Beautiful Day'

1179
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,829
in total darkness?"

1180
00:45:32,163 --> 00:45:33,699
"You don't
wanna do that?"

1181
00:45:33,732 --> 00:45:35,467
So you're feeling good
and you're dancing.

1182
00:45:35,501 --> 00:45:37,135
You're like, "I feel so thin."

1183
00:45:37,168 --> 00:45:38,269
"I've never been hotter
in my life.

1184
00:45:38,303 --> 00:45:39,971
I feel so good."
And then, it hits you.

1185
00:45:40,005 --> 00:45:43,341
You're like, "oh, my God.
I feel so good right now."

1186
00:45:43,375 --> 00:45:45,577
"I feel so awesome and happy.

1187
00:45:45,611 --> 00:45:47,679
"I wish I could feel this way
all the time.

1188
00:45:47,713 --> 00:45:51,049
I wish I could feel this buzz
and this happy all the time."

1189
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:53,519
And that's when you realize

1190
00:45:53,552 --> 00:45:57,656
that's how an alcoholic thinks.

1191
00:45:57,689 --> 00:45:59,558
But you're, like, "Screw it.
I'm gonna give it a shot."

1192
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:02,728
I'm gonna see just how far
I can push being drunk."

1193
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:04,195
So you decide to do shots.

1194
00:46:04,229 --> 00:46:06,498
And you decide,
"These shots aren't gonna get me

1195
00:46:06,532 --> 00:46:10,869
'cause tonight's the night
I outsmart the liquor."

1196
00:46:10,902 --> 00:46:14,372
"Not gonna happen tonight
'cause I'm gonna drink water.

1197
00:46:14,406 --> 00:46:16,207
Going to drink a glass of water
with each shot."

1198
00:46:16,241 --> 00:46:17,709
And this is your brilliant idea.

1199
00:46:17,743 --> 00:46:21,112
No one in the thousands of years
of people imbibing alcohol

1200
00:46:21,146 --> 00:46:22,213
has ever thought of this.

1201
00:46:22,247 --> 00:46:24,049
This is your night, Einstein.

1202
00:46:24,082 --> 00:46:25,784
It's your big plan.

1203
00:46:25,817 --> 00:46:28,319
"I'm gonna do a shot
and then have a glass of water,

1204
00:46:28,353 --> 00:46:29,821
"and then a shot,
and then a glass of water.

1205
00:46:29,855 --> 00:46:31,790
"You can't buy me a shot now,
but thank you.

1206
00:46:31,823 --> 00:46:33,559
I'm just having water."

1207
00:46:33,592 --> 00:46:35,293
"I'm just having..."

1208
00:46:35,326 --> 00:46:37,362
"I'm just drinking water,
but thank you."

1209
00:46:37,395 --> 00:46:39,364
Shot and water,
but what you don't realize

1210
00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:40,732
is that five shots in an hour

1211
00:46:40,766 --> 00:46:44,636
is still five fucking shots
in an hour.

1212
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:47,473
You went and drank all
that water like a crazy camel.

1213
00:46:47,506 --> 00:46:49,107
Yeah, good job.
Now, you're bloated.

1214
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,276
And you have to pee.
Way to be.

1215
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:52,478
'Cause when a girl's gotta pee,

1216
00:46:52,511 --> 00:46:54,513
everything has to come
to a halt.

1217
00:46:54,546 --> 00:46:55,714
Every girl's gotta go with her.

1218
00:46:55,747 --> 00:46:58,116
"I have to pee.
Do you have to pee?"

1219
00:47:01,186 --> 00:47:04,856
"I can't go alone.
No."

1220
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:06,525
"Will you stop what you're doing
and come with me?"

1221
00:47:06,558 --> 00:47:08,293
"I have to pee.
Do you have to pee?"

1222
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:10,662
"I have to pee.
I have to go pee."

1223
00:47:16,502 --> 00:47:18,604
Can't go in the bathroom alone.

1224
00:47:18,637 --> 00:47:21,372
You might not come back.

1225
00:47:21,406 --> 00:47:22,708
'Cause no girl's ever been

1226
00:47:22,741 --> 00:47:25,977
to the bathroom alone
and survived.

1227
00:47:26,011 --> 00:47:27,513
it's true.

1228
00:47:27,546 --> 00:47:29,881
The last woman
that attempted it,

1229
00:47:29,915 --> 00:47:32,250
it was 1937...

1230
00:47:32,283 --> 00:47:35,621
And her name was Amelia Earhart.

1231
00:47:42,427 --> 00:47:44,262
It's a big event.

1232
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:45,764
"I have to pee.
Come on. Let's go.

1233
00:47:45,797 --> 00:47:47,265
"Every girl, let's go,
you girls.

1234
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:48,600
"Come on.
I have to pee, come on.

1235
00:47:48,634 --> 00:47:50,001
"Take my hand.
Let's make a chain of whores.

1236
00:47:50,035 --> 00:47:51,336
Everyone holds hands."

1237
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:52,871
As they walk into the bathroom.

1238
00:47:52,904 --> 00:47:55,507
For me, when I'm walking
through a crowded bar,

1239
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:57,909
the amount of aggression
I will display

1240
00:47:57,943 --> 00:48:00,912
toward the other bar patrons
is in direct correlation

1241
00:48:00,946 --> 00:48:03,148
with how many boys
I've gotten to flirt with.

1242
00:48:03,181 --> 00:48:06,451
Meaning if I haven't gotten
to talk to any cute guys,

1243
00:48:06,484 --> 00:48:08,219
mama's gonna be
a little aggressive

1244
00:48:08,253 --> 00:48:09,955
in her walk
to the bathroom, okay?

1245
00:48:09,988 --> 00:48:12,057
Guys, when they get drunk,
sometimes punch walls.

1246
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,491
I like to mule kick other girls
in the shin.

1247
00:48:13,525 --> 00:48:14,993
It's totally fine.

1248
00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:16,427
Every girl's done this.
And you know why we do it?

1249
00:48:16,461 --> 00:48:17,929
'Cause we can get away with it.

1250
00:48:17,963 --> 00:48:19,665
You can knock into a girl
and then be, like, "Oops."

1251
00:48:19,698 --> 00:48:21,166
I didn't mean that."

1252
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:24,936
Our smile
is our Jedi mind trick.

1253
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:27,939
Just, "These are not the droids
you're looking for."

1254
00:48:27,973 --> 00:48:30,709
You ever do that?

1255
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:32,077
You ever just check a girl
into the boards 'cause you can?

1256
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:33,579
You ever just been walking,
and just been, like...

1257
00:48:33,612 --> 00:48:35,847
"I love your shoes. Oops."

1258
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:40,051
Takes you forever,
but you finally get through

1259
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:41,086
that jungle of people.

1260
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,420
You get to the bathroom.

1261
00:48:42,453 --> 00:48:44,389
For those of you
that haven't been

1262
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:45,757
in a women's restroom
late night,

1263
00:48:45,791 --> 00:48:47,926
a women's restroom late night

1264
00:48:47,959 --> 00:48:50,996
looks like a scene out of
"Apocalypse Now."

1265
00:48:52,397 --> 00:48:54,600
There's gunfire, explosions,

1266
00:48:54,633 --> 00:48:56,835
blood everywhere, children,

1267
00:48:56,868 --> 00:48:59,504
a lot of vietnamese men,
which I never quite understood,

1268
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:00,471
like, why they'd be there.

1269
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:01,740
You're with your buddies

1270
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:03,508
just trying
to get through everything.

1271
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:05,577
You go pee.
You get to the sink.

1272
00:49:05,611 --> 00:49:08,747
And then, your night comes
to a screeching halt

1273
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:11,650
'cause for the first time
in, like, four hours,

1274
00:49:11,683 --> 00:49:13,752
you get a look at yourself
in the mirror.

1275
00:49:18,824 --> 00:49:23,228
And you see the swamp witch
that you've become.

1276
00:49:26,765 --> 00:49:28,700
Ten minutes ago, you thought
you looked like Heidi Klum.

1277
00:49:28,734 --> 00:49:31,136
It turns out you look like Seal.

1278
00:49:38,844 --> 00:49:41,046
It hits you like a ton of bricks
out of nowhere.

1279
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:42,547
And you don't know it's coming.

1280
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:43,849
You're sitting there
talking to your friends.

1281
00:49:43,882 --> 00:49:45,717
You're like,
"This is awesome."

1282
00:49:45,751 --> 00:49:50,288
"- I'm gonna be young forever.
- This is..."

1283
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:52,924
"No! what?
What is this?

1284
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:56,828
I was once
a great beauty."

1285
00:49:56,862 --> 00:49:59,497
"No.

1286
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:01,700
What is this?"

1287
00:50:01,733 --> 00:50:03,501
You go to touch it.
It disappears.

1288
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:04,535
You're, like...

1289
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:06,304
"Is it a hologram?
What is that?

1290
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:07,472
I look weird."

1291
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:09,540
One eyeball has migrated here.

1292
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:13,278
You look down.
You're just leaking vodka.

1293
00:50:15,747 --> 00:50:17,983
Now, you don't wanna hook up
with anyone.

1294
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:22,788
Now, all you wanna do is eat.

1295
00:50:22,821 --> 00:50:24,723
I'm a red-blooded
American girl.

1296
00:50:24,756 --> 00:50:26,491
Absolutely, when I get drunk,
I would rather eat

1297
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:27,793
than hook up with you.

1298
00:50:27,826 --> 00:50:30,428
I'm sorry.
I don't know.

1299
00:50:30,461 --> 00:50:32,698
Give you a hand job
or go get fries?

1300
00:50:43,608 --> 00:50:45,576
Both are salty.
One will give me carpal tunnel.

1301
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:48,980
I'll go with the fries.
Every time.

1302
00:50:51,182 --> 00:50:52,718
A popular misconception
about girls

1303
00:50:52,751 --> 00:50:53,752
is that we don't like to eat.

1304
00:50:53,785 --> 00:50:56,855
Girls love to eat.
Yeah.

1305
00:50:56,888 --> 00:50:58,589
We just don't like to eat
in front of a guy that we like.

1306
00:50:58,623 --> 00:50:59,858
That's the difference.

1307
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:01,793
When you first meet a guy
that you like,

1308
00:51:01,827 --> 00:51:03,328
you can't eat the way
you want to on a date.

1309
00:51:03,361 --> 00:51:04,896
You can't.

1310
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:07,165
You can't have that fourth plate
of ribs on a date...

1311
00:51:10,068 --> 00:51:14,539
I found out.

1312
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:15,473
Going on a date,
society dictates

1313
00:51:15,506 --> 00:51:16,574
that guys can do what they want

1314
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,843
and women have to be dainty.

1315
00:51:17,876 --> 00:51:20,245
So he's gonna get fries,
a burger,

1316
00:51:20,278 --> 00:51:23,014
half a gazelle,
whatever he wants to eat.

1317
00:51:23,048 --> 00:51:25,383
Girls, you get the menu,
what are you ordering?

1318
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,418
- Salad.
- Salad.

1319
00:51:27,452 --> 00:51:34,492
Like hot little robots.
Salad.

1320
00:51:34,525 --> 00:51:36,094
And it's
an excruciating experience

1321
00:51:36,127 --> 00:51:37,662
'cause you're trying to just
look pretty the whole time.

1322
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:38,864
He's sitting there
enjoying his burger.

1323
00:51:38,897 --> 00:51:40,631
You're eating your lettuce.

1324
00:51:40,665 --> 00:51:41,599
You're just sitting there
going, "Ugh."

1325
00:51:41,632 --> 00:51:43,201
You've abandoned the utensils.

1326
00:51:43,234 --> 00:51:45,436
You ordered, like, a koala.
You may as well eat like one.

1327
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:46,371
You're just, like...

1328
00:51:53,544 --> 00:51:55,313
He's talking.

1329
00:51:55,346 --> 00:51:56,915
You can't focus
'cause you're starving, right?

1330
00:51:56,948 --> 00:51:58,483
He's yapping.
You're just, like...

1331
00:51:58,516 --> 00:51:59,785
You finished your lettuce.

1332
00:51:59,818 --> 00:52:01,619
There's no more watercress
on the plate.

1333
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:02,653
You're just...
You pull one...

1334
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:04,089
You're looking at his food.

1335
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:05,290
You're, like,
"What's that over there?

1336
00:52:05,323 --> 00:52:06,992
Fry."

1337
00:52:07,025 --> 00:52:09,895
Talking, talking. You can't
focus. You can't focus.

1338
00:52:09,928 --> 00:52:11,696
You're not getting any
nutrients to your brain.

1339
00:52:11,729 --> 00:52:13,664
You're just kind of staring out
the window,

1340
00:52:13,698 --> 00:52:15,133
wondering what birds taste like.

1341
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:17,102
You're just, like...

1342
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:19,737
You finished your lemon wedge,
like, an hour ago.

1343
00:52:19,771 --> 00:52:21,039
He's still eating.
He's still talking.

1344
00:52:21,072 --> 00:52:22,707
And you're... you're starting
to get cold now.

1345
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,810
You're not getting any nutrition
into your bloodstream.

1346
00:52:24,843 --> 00:52:26,644
Your spine is sticking out.
You're shivering.

1347
00:52:26,677 --> 00:52:28,113
You start...
You're like a lost puppy.

1348
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:30,281
You start saying things
that you don't mean.

1349
00:52:30,315 --> 00:52:32,017
He's yapping. You start
just saying things, like,

1350
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:34,052
"I would love to spend
the afternoon with your mother.

1351
00:52:34,085 --> 00:52:36,721
"That sounds great.
And no, I totally cared

1352
00:52:36,754 --> 00:52:38,723
"about that whole replacement
refs thing.

1353
00:52:38,756 --> 00:52:43,494
It really rocked my world
as well."

1354
00:52:43,528 --> 00:52:44,695
Once you're in a relationship,

1355
00:52:44,729 --> 00:52:46,998
you can eat the way you want to.

1356
00:52:47,032 --> 00:52:49,434
Once he loves you, you can roll
out a trough at mealtime.

1357
00:52:49,467 --> 00:52:50,668
It doesn't matter.

1358
00:52:50,701 --> 00:52:51,803
You can put your hands behind
your back,

1359
00:52:51,837 --> 00:52:53,738
county fair
pie-eating-contest-style.

1360
00:52:55,874 --> 00:52:57,508
"I love you.
Is that the house cat?"

1361
00:52:59,911 --> 00:53:02,247
Yeah, you can let it all
hang out when he loves you.

1362
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,782
Then, you can show him
how you eat.

1363
00:53:04,816 --> 00:53:06,151
Once you're in love,
you can show him

1364
00:53:06,184 --> 00:53:09,620
the 12-foot man-eating lizard
you actually are.

1365
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:27,672
Your eyes light up red.
Vwoom, vwoom.

1366
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:30,608
"Let's get cheesecake."

1367
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:32,710
"Oh, cool, sweetheart.

1368
00:53:32,743 --> 00:53:34,245
You wanna share
a piece of cheesecake?"

1369
00:53:34,279 --> 00:53:36,747
"Uh-uh."

1370
00:53:36,781 --> 00:53:39,684
Tail swipe.

1371
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:44,522
"Get your own."

1372
00:53:49,194 --> 00:53:51,096
"All right, sweetheart.
Dinner's over.

1373
00:53:51,129 --> 00:53:53,031
Did you get enough to eat?"
I love when they ask that

1374
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:54,799
'cause I've always wanted
to give this answer.

1375
00:53:54,832 --> 00:53:57,802
"Did you get enough
to eat?"

1376
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:04,709
"Uh-uh."

1377
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:06,244
"Why?
what else do you want?"

1378
00:54:06,277 --> 00:54:08,579
"Your soul!

1379
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:12,483
Fire!"

1380
00:54:19,925 --> 00:54:22,393
Can I ask you...
Can I ask you a question?

1381
00:54:23,995 --> 00:54:25,530
Does this tail
make my butt look big?

1382
00:54:41,512 --> 00:54:43,381
Girls love eating.
We do.

1383
00:54:43,414 --> 00:54:44,749
We were the first ones
to make it fun.

1384
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:46,317
Hello? Apple?
Garden of Eden.

1385
00:54:46,351 --> 00:54:48,386
Mm-hmm.

1386
00:54:48,419 --> 00:54:49,988
Girls love to eat.

1387
00:54:50,021 --> 00:54:51,889
I saw a Bachelorette party
take down a live Buffalo

1388
00:54:51,923 --> 00:54:53,724
at 35 miles an hour
off the freeway.

1389
00:54:53,758 --> 00:54:55,760
It was magnificent.

1390
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:57,095
The girls ran alongside it.

1391
00:54:57,128 --> 00:54:59,897
Like, "Stacy put your veil
over his snout."

1392
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,834
You ever tried
to get a group of drunk girls

1393
00:55:03,868 --> 00:55:07,973
to walk from a bar
to a restaurant?

1394
00:55:08,006 --> 00:55:11,209
It's like herding drunk,
retarded sheep.

1395
00:55:12,877 --> 00:55:14,812
First of all, yes,
I love being a woman.

1396
00:55:14,845 --> 00:55:16,381
We're amazing.
I love Beyoncé.

1397
00:55:16,414 --> 00:55:19,017
But we have no idea
where we're going.

1398
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:21,052
Okay?
We're walking around.

1399
00:55:21,086 --> 00:55:23,388
All we know is that we got
little sheep hooves on

1400
00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:27,392
and we're freezing
because no one brought a jacket.

1401
00:55:29,027 --> 00:55:30,795
Just walking forever, no clue.

1402
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:31,963
"I'm cold.  I'm cold."

1403
00:55:31,997 --> 00:55:33,498
"Why didn't
you bring a jacket?"

1404
00:55:33,531 --> 00:55:35,533
"'Cause I'm in my 20s
and I'm stupid."

1405
00:55:37,935 --> 00:55:39,070
"I'm cold."

1406
00:55:39,104 --> 00:55:40,571
"I have to pee.
I'm cold."

1407
00:55:40,605 --> 00:55:42,440
"I have to pee.
I don't have solutions.

1408
00:55:42,473 --> 00:55:43,908
Just more problems."

1409
00:55:48,113 --> 00:55:49,514
Everybody's got
that one girlfriend

1410
00:55:49,547 --> 00:55:50,615
that's a little filthy.

1411
00:55:50,648 --> 00:55:53,584
She has no issue
with peeing behind a dumpster.

1412
00:55:53,618 --> 00:55:55,486
It holds everyone up.

1413
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,422
You're all trying to walk
and she's back there.

1414
00:55:57,455 --> 00:56:00,491
She's, like...

1415
00:56:00,525 --> 00:56:02,760
"You guys!"

1416
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:03,928
"Wa-a-a-ait."

1417
00:56:06,931 --> 00:56:09,067
"Wait, no, make sure
nobody's watching."

1418
00:56:10,401 --> 00:56:12,170
You're sitting there
running interference

1419
00:56:12,203 --> 00:56:14,705
for your friend, like,
"Don't look at her sheep vagina.

1420
00:56:14,739 --> 00:56:16,174
Just mine."

1421
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:18,043
I promise you nobody's watching.

1422
00:56:18,076 --> 00:56:19,244
I promise you.

1423
00:56:19,277 --> 00:56:21,079
I promise you
no guy is driving by,

1424
00:56:21,112 --> 00:56:23,081
like, "Ugh, well,
tonight really sucks."

1425
00:56:23,114 --> 00:56:24,415
"And I..."

1426
00:56:24,449 --> 00:56:27,118
"Whoa."

1427
00:56:27,152 --> 00:56:29,487
"Is that a drunk girl
peeing on hot garbage?"

1428
00:56:31,522 --> 00:56:32,857
"That's awesome."

1429
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,059
"Oh, what am I doing?

1430
00:56:34,092 --> 00:56:35,660
I got to get
to the craft store."

1431
00:56:42,567 --> 00:56:46,237
Oh.

1432
00:56:46,271 --> 00:56:48,873
So she's... she's done peeing.
You're all wandering.

1433
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:49,840
Now, you're
into the second hour.

1434
00:56:49,874 --> 00:56:51,309
You're still drunk somehow.

1435
00:56:51,342 --> 00:56:53,844
You're cold, you're hungry,
and you...

1436
00:56:53,878 --> 00:56:54,879
Everybody's got
that one girlfriend

1437
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,614
that has a poor moral barometer.

1438
00:56:56,647 --> 00:56:58,949
She'll get in a car
with any guy...

1439
00:56:58,983 --> 00:57:01,652
As long as it looks warm.

1440
00:57:01,686 --> 00:57:04,021
And she'll rationalize
why he's not a rapist

1441
00:57:04,055 --> 00:57:05,923
based solely on the way
that he's dressed.

1442
00:57:05,956 --> 00:57:07,958
Every girl's
had to do this, right?

1443
00:57:07,992 --> 00:57:09,260
You have to make these, like,
game-time decisions.

1444
00:57:09,294 --> 00:57:10,661
You're, like,
"He's not gonna rape me.

1445
00:57:10,695 --> 00:57:12,697
He's wearing Nike dunks."

1446
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:13,931
"Guys, come over here."

1447
00:57:13,964 --> 00:57:15,266
Your friend goes over
to the guy.

1448
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,368
She bends down
like a streetwalker.

1449
00:57:17,402 --> 00:57:18,769
She's, like,
"Hi, what's your name?

1450
00:57:18,803 --> 00:57:20,538
"Todd?
Oh, that's a fun name.

1451
00:57:20,571 --> 00:57:22,540
"That's a really exotic name.
Oh, you'll give us a ride?

1452
00:57:22,573 --> 00:57:24,875
Okay, that's really fun.
My name is Crystal."

1453
00:57:24,909 --> 00:57:25,843
"Nice to meet you.

1454
00:57:25,876 --> 00:57:28,146
"Hold on a second.
You guys!

1455
00:57:28,179 --> 00:57:29,880
He's gonna give us a ride."

1456
00:57:29,914 --> 00:57:32,083
"He's gonna give us a ride."

1457
00:57:32,117 --> 00:57:33,351
"Do you wanna go with him?"
Your friends know better.

1458
00:57:33,384 --> 00:57:35,086
They're on the other side
of the street

1459
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,455
huddled together,
like, "Crystal, get away."

1460
00:57:40,258 --> 00:57:44,229
"We're not... get... he's not..."

1461
00:57:48,233 --> 00:57:49,834
Crystal's stupid,
and she's already...

1462
00:57:49,867 --> 00:57:51,302
She's, like,
"Hold on one second.

1463
00:57:51,336 --> 00:57:53,604
"Thank you so much.
I really like your chin strap.

1464
00:57:53,638 --> 00:57:55,940
It's really attractive."

1465
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:56,974
"Hold on one second.
Hold on.

1466
00:57:57,007 --> 00:57:58,143
"Let me...
You guys!

1467
00:57:58,176 --> 00:57:59,544
"He's gonna give us a ride.

1468
00:57:59,577 --> 00:58:01,746
"Like, do you wanna just
keep walking?

1469
00:58:01,779 --> 00:58:03,714
Sarah, you're being a bitch."

1470
00:58:03,748 --> 00:58:04,915
"You are... like, we talked
about this earlier

1471
00:58:04,949 --> 00:58:06,451
"when you were in the bathroom.

1472
00:58:06,484 --> 00:58:08,085
"You're being... this is,
like, what we talked about.

1473
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:09,354
"You're being a...
Do you not wanna...

1474
00:58:09,387 --> 00:58:10,888
"You don't wanna go with him?

1475
00:58:10,921 --> 00:58:11,922
"You guy...
Hold on one second.

1476
00:58:11,956 --> 00:58:13,090
"Thank you so much.
Hold on one...

1477
00:58:13,124 --> 00:58:14,659
"Okay, hold on.
Hold on a sec.

1478
00:58:14,692 --> 00:58:15,960
"You guys, he's gonna give us...
He's being nice.

1479
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:17,795
"Stop it.
Stop it.

1480
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:20,598
He's not... he's not...
He's not gonna rape us."

1481
00:58:22,767 --> 00:58:24,935
"He's not gonna rape us."

1482
00:58:24,969 --> 00:58:27,972
You have to whisper
the rape part.

1483
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,274
Just in case
that was his intention,

1484
00:58:29,307 --> 00:58:31,442
you don't want to offend him
ahead of time.

1485
00:58:34,145 --> 00:58:35,946
God forbid you offend him
and he leaves.

1486
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,149
Oh, no.
Then what?

1487
00:58:38,183 --> 00:58:42,019
"He's not gonna rape us.
He's wearing skechers."

1488
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:45,022
That's fair.

1489
00:58:45,055 --> 00:58:46,357
Now, you're into hour three.

1490
00:58:46,391 --> 00:58:48,493
You didn't take the ride
from chin strap.

1491
00:58:48,526 --> 00:58:50,395
So you're walking.
You're cold.

1492
00:58:50,428 --> 00:58:52,163
No one knows where they're going

1493
00:58:52,197 --> 00:58:55,233
'cause you're all relying
on girl GPS.

1494
00:58:55,266 --> 00:58:56,867
For those of you
that don't know,

1495
00:58:56,901 --> 00:59:00,571
girl GPS pretty much consists
of one girl doing this:

1496
00:59:00,605 --> 00:59:04,309
"Um..."

1497
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:09,947
"I feel
like it's this way."

1498
00:59:21,959 --> 00:59:23,294
Girls, when you get drunk,

1499
00:59:23,328 --> 00:59:25,730
who are you most likely
to pick a fight with?

1500
00:59:25,763 --> 00:59:26,697
Your boyfriend.

1501
00:59:26,731 --> 00:59:28,366
Do you wanna know why?

1502
00:59:28,399 --> 00:59:29,700
'Cause you know
he's not gonna hit you back.

1503
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:33,170
Every girl in here knows
that your boyfriend

1504
00:59:33,204 --> 00:59:35,373
will take a healthy dose
of your drunk ranting.

1505
00:59:35,406 --> 00:59:37,642
Why?

1506
00:59:37,675 --> 00:59:38,943
'Cause at the end of the night
when you're all tuckered out,

1507
00:59:38,976 --> 00:59:40,144
he's gonna want
to mouth-kiss you

1508
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:43,414
and touch your snootch,
that's why.

1509
00:59:43,448 --> 00:59:45,283
I hate to tell you
it's why they do everything.

1510
00:59:45,316 --> 00:59:47,151
It's why they put up
with your attitude.

1511
00:59:47,184 --> 00:59:48,619
It's why they buy you
expensive drinks.

1512
00:59:48,653 --> 00:59:50,455
It's why they let you make them
turn the game off

1513
00:59:50,488 --> 00:59:52,790
so you can show them
what you did on Pinterest.

1514
00:59:52,823 --> 00:59:55,426
Okay?  For snootches.

1515
00:59:57,295 --> 00:59:59,597
"Steve, come here.
Come look at this.

1516
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:02,066
"No, like, off.
Like, turn it off.

1517
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:03,368
"Don't p...
Just, like, shut it off.

1518
01:00:03,401 --> 01:00:04,935
"I wanna show you something.
Come here.

1519
01:00:04,969 --> 01:00:07,137
Come here.
Come here."

1520
01:00:07,171 --> 01:00:09,307
"Look, look what I have.
Look what I pinned.

1521
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:11,141
"Look at this.

1522
01:00:11,175 --> 01:00:15,413
It's an entire wedding
made of cheese."

1523
01:00:15,446 --> 01:00:18,816
"It can be our wedding."

1524
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:23,388
"Steven?"

1525
01:00:23,421 --> 01:00:24,755
I call it a "snootch"

1526
01:00:24,789 --> 01:00:27,758
'cause I don't like
the word "vagina."

1527
01:00:27,792 --> 01:00:30,060
No one says "vagina."

1528
01:00:30,094 --> 01:00:31,962
Like, no one says that.
That's weird.

1529
01:00:31,996 --> 01:00:33,331
No one here has ever been
hooking up with someone

1530
01:00:33,364 --> 01:00:34,932
and been, like,
"this feels great.

1531
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,567
Continue to touch
my vagina."

1532
01:00:37,835 --> 01:00:39,236
Vagina?
What?

1533
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:41,572
A vagina sounds
like an Indian Casino.

1534
01:00:44,542 --> 01:00:47,512
"This weekend at vagina..."

1535
01:00:47,545 --> 01:00:51,549
"Wayne Newton at vagina."

1536
01:00:51,582 --> 01:00:53,984
I made up "snootch"
'cause it's so cute-sounding.

1537
01:00:54,018 --> 01:00:56,654
Snootch.

1538
01:00:56,687 --> 01:00:58,489
Snootch.

1539
01:00:58,523 --> 01:01:00,558
Maybe it would be,
like, a cartoon character.

1540
01:01:00,591 --> 01:01:03,127
Maybe it would be,
like, a cute, tiny,

1541
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:07,097
furry... obviously...
Character.

1542
01:01:07,131 --> 01:01:09,334
It's got a little top hat.

1543
01:01:09,367 --> 01:01:10,935
And maybe before you have sex,

1544
01:01:10,968 --> 01:01:12,169
you have to summon snootch

1545
01:01:12,202 --> 01:01:15,139
so he can bless the whole thing.

1546
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:16,441
Yeah, that's what
you have to do.

1547
01:01:16,474 --> 01:01:17,775
You're having...
You're about to have sex.

1548
01:01:17,808 --> 01:01:19,644
You have to get out
a snootch flute

1549
01:01:19,677 --> 01:01:20,978
which you have to preorder.

1550
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:23,247
You have to order them online.

1551
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,715
It's a...
It's a dot-gov site.

1552
01:01:24,749 --> 01:01:26,451
You pull it out.

1553
01:01:26,484 --> 01:01:28,419
You're, like,
"You ready to have sex?"

1554
01:01:28,453 --> 01:01:30,355
"Sure, let's... let's...
Let's summon snootch."

1555
01:01:30,388 --> 01:01:31,722
"Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

1556
01:01:31,756 --> 01:01:36,994
Snootch!"

1557
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:38,162
"Hi, folks."
"Hi, snootch.

1558
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:39,229
"We were just about to have sex.

1559
01:01:39,263 --> 01:01:40,164
Do we have
your blessing?"

1560
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:41,366
"Well, you surely do.

1561
01:01:41,399 --> 01:01:42,633
"It was nice meeting
both of you,

1562
01:01:42,667 --> 01:01:44,168
"but I better be on my way.

1563
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:45,235
"Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

1564
01:01:45,269 --> 01:01:48,739
Snootch!"

1565
01:01:48,773 --> 01:01:51,576
So cute.

1566
01:01:51,609 --> 01:01:53,478
I made up "snootch"
'cause I don't like the p-word.

1567
01:01:53,511 --> 01:01:55,279
I don't like saying it.
it's not a lady word.

1568
01:01:55,312 --> 01:01:57,448
Pussy.

1569
01:01:57,482 --> 01:01:59,049
If I got to say it,
there's gonna be

1570
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:01,151
an involuntary facial spasm
that comes with it.

1571
01:02:01,185 --> 01:02:02,353
You should know that.

1572
01:02:02,387 --> 01:02:04,088
I will ruin any sort of moment

1573
01:02:04,121 --> 01:02:05,456
we have going in the bedroom.

1574
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:07,157
"All right, babe.
This is great.

1575
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:08,626
Tell me where you want me
to put it."

1576
01:02:08,659 --> 01:02:10,728
"I'll say it,
but you're not gonna like it."

1577
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:16,200
"Come on. Where do you
want me to put it?"

1578
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:18,736
"Why don't you put it
in my pussy!"

1579
01:02:23,273 --> 01:02:24,575
"I can't."
"What'd you say?"

1580
01:02:24,609 --> 01:02:26,176
"Nothing.
I'm fine, I'm fine."

1581
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:27,244
"All right. Let's do this."

1582
01:02:27,277 --> 01:02:28,312
"Great."
"All right, come on.

1583
01:02:28,345 --> 01:02:29,614
"Let's get back to it.

1584
01:02:29,647 --> 01:02:31,248
All right, where do you
want me to put it?"

1585
01:02:31,281 --> 01:02:33,283
"Why don't you put it
in my pussy!"

1586
01:02:33,317 --> 01:02:36,621
"No!"

1587
01:02:36,654 --> 01:02:39,189
It's not a lady word.
Ladies don't say that word.

1588
01:02:39,223 --> 01:02:40,725
Like, growing up,
did your mom ever say,

1589
01:02:40,758 --> 01:02:42,026
"pussy, you need
to shower?"

1590
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:43,461
No, she didn't, right?

1591
01:02:43,494 --> 01:02:46,697
No, and if she did,
then your mom was white trash.

1592
01:02:49,967 --> 01:02:51,469
It's not a lady word.

1593
01:02:51,502 --> 01:02:54,104
It's not a word that women hear
independent of men.

1594
01:02:54,138 --> 01:02:57,408
Most women don't hear that word
,
like, in professional ether.

1595
01:02:57,442 --> 01:02:59,710
No woman's laying there
at the gynecologist.

1596
01:02:59,744 --> 01:03:01,211
Doctor walks in, he's, like...

1597
01:03:01,245 --> 01:03:03,581
"What's up?"

1598
01:03:03,614 --> 01:03:06,684
"How's it hangin'?
All right, let's see.

1599
01:03:06,717 --> 01:03:12,189
Pussy checks out all right."

1600
01:03:12,222 --> 01:03:13,390
"Great tits, by the way.
Good hustle.

1601
01:03:13,424 --> 01:03:17,495
Get outta here."

1602
01:03:21,098 --> 01:03:22,500
It's... it's a guy word.

1603
01:03:22,533 --> 01:03:24,469
I don't care that guys say it.

1604
01:03:24,502 --> 01:03:26,303
Boys are gross, and that's
why we love them, okay?

1605
01:03:26,336 --> 01:03:27,838
But that's a guy thing.

1606
01:03:27,872 --> 01:03:29,607
That's what guys say
in the locker rooms

1607
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,776
with... with...
With all their grossness.

1608
01:03:31,809 --> 01:03:33,377
I'd imagine they go
to the locker room

1609
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:35,446
after a rousing game
of touch softball,

1610
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:36,747
and they talk
about the p-word.

1611
01:03:36,781 --> 01:03:39,216
"Hey, what's up?
What's up, bro?

1612
01:03:39,249 --> 01:03:40,417
"What's up?
Did you get any...

1613
01:03:40,451 --> 01:03:41,586
Did you get any pussy
last night?"

1614
01:03:41,619 --> 01:03:42,753
"Yeah, a whole bucket."

1615
01:03:42,787 --> 01:03:47,725
I don't know
how you quantify it.

1616
01:03:47,758 --> 01:03:50,127
I don't know if it goes bucket,
mug, ramekin.

1617
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,362
I don't know.

1618
01:03:52,396 --> 01:03:54,499
But that's what guys do
in the locker rooms

1619
01:03:54,532 --> 01:03:56,300
with the butt slaps
and the sword fighting.

1620
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:59,937
That's what they do.

1621
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:01,405
We know about that.

1622
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:03,007
We know you do weird things
with each other

1623
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,675
with your wieners
'cause you do weird things

1624
01:04:04,709 --> 01:04:06,276
with us, and you're trying
to impress us.

1625
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:10,114
So I can only imagine
what creepiness

1626
01:04:10,147 --> 01:04:11,682
goes on behind closed doors.

1627
01:04:11,716 --> 01:04:13,884
I've seen it firsthand.

1628
01:04:13,918 --> 01:04:15,385
Every girl has.

1629
01:04:15,419 --> 01:04:16,487
Every girl's had that boyfriend

1630
01:04:16,521 --> 01:04:18,288
where you're sitting on the bed

1631
01:04:18,322 --> 01:04:19,690
in your target
underwear waiting.

1632
01:04:19,724 --> 01:04:21,992
He comes out
of the bathroom naked

1633
01:04:22,026 --> 01:04:23,561
except for a t-shirt.

1634
01:04:23,594 --> 01:04:27,231
No bottoms,
Donald Ducking it the whole way.

1635
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:37,608
He's got this grin on his face.

1636
01:04:37,642 --> 01:04:40,044
And he's just, like, "Hey, babe."

1637
01:04:40,077 --> 01:04:43,447
Babe, check this out."

1638
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:51,488
Why are you doing that?

1639
01:04:51,522 --> 01:04:54,825
On behalf of all women, why?

1640
01:04:54,859 --> 01:04:58,563
It's never gonna change
a girl's mind, ever.

1641
01:04:58,596 --> 01:05:00,230
You are not helping yourself.

1642
01:05:00,264 --> 01:05:01,732
No woman, I promise you, ever...

1643
01:05:01,766 --> 01:05:04,234
You're sitting there
doing that like a circus monkey,

1644
01:05:04,268 --> 01:05:07,938
no girl is gonna
turn around, like...

1645
01:05:14,278 --> 01:05:17,214
"My, my, my."

1646
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:18,916
"You know what's crazy?"

1647
01:05:18,949 --> 01:05:21,652
"Um..."

1648
01:05:21,686 --> 01:05:26,957
"I didn't want to have sex
with you before."

1649
01:05:26,991 --> 01:05:29,493
"But now..."

1650
01:05:29,526 --> 01:05:35,299
"Now that you've displayed
the agility..."

1651
01:05:35,332 --> 01:05:39,336
"Of your flaccid penis...

1652
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:44,008
"As it slaps
in rhythmic repetition...

1653
01:05:44,041 --> 01:05:45,643
"Against either one

1654
01:05:45,676 --> 01:05:49,714
"of your clearly
never-seen-by-the-sun thighs,

1655
01:05:49,747 --> 01:05:53,217
now, snootch time."

1656
01:06:08,498 --> 01:06:11,468
In closing, I would...

1657
01:06:11,501 --> 01:06:13,604
In closing, I would like to give

1658
01:06:13,638 --> 01:06:16,440
the girls in this room
a bit of advice, okay?

1659
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:18,743
I have a tip for you,
but just the tip.

1660
01:06:24,615 --> 01:06:29,419
Ladies, never order a lobster
on a date.

1661
01:06:29,453 --> 01:06:31,321
The lobster is the most

1662
01:06:31,355 --> 01:06:33,123
expensive thing
on the menu, okay?

1663
01:06:33,157 --> 01:06:36,861
So just know that if you order
and consume a lobster,

1664
01:06:36,894 --> 01:06:40,197
you have to touch
your date's weiner.

1665
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:41,866
You have to, okay?

1666
01:06:41,899 --> 01:06:46,003
It's like a sexual contract
from the sea.

1667
01:06:49,206 --> 01:06:51,041
It's binding.

1668
01:06:51,075 --> 01:06:54,812
Now, keep in mind he wants you
to get the lobster.

1669
01:06:54,845 --> 01:06:57,047
He's not gonna make you get it,

1670
01:06:57,081 --> 01:06:59,083
but he's hoping you'll come
to that conclusion on your own.

1671
01:06:59,116 --> 01:07:00,885
He's hoping you'll be flipping
through the menu,

1672
01:07:00,918 --> 01:07:02,987
and you'll be, like,
"I don't know what to get."

1673
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:04,554
"Like, I'm just... I don't know.
I'm eating fresh this week."

1674
01:07:04,588 --> 01:07:06,156
"I'm eating a lot
of fresh things."

1675
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:08,325
"That's my new thing, fresh.
I'm just gonna do fresh food."

1676
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:10,627
"Lobster?

1677
01:07:10,661 --> 01:07:12,429
"Should I... should I get it?
Should I get it?

1678
01:07:12,462 --> 01:07:13,864
"Should I get the lobster?

1679
01:07:13,898 --> 01:07:15,332
"Should I crack it open
on my head like an otter,

1680
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:16,300
"eat it off my chest?

1681
01:07:16,333 --> 01:07:17,835
Lobster?"

1682
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:19,336
"Yeah, 'cause then,
it's weiner time

1683
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:21,338
this sunday at vagina."

1684
01:07:25,075 --> 01:07:26,777
Here's how it's gonna
go down, okay?

1685
01:07:26,811 --> 01:07:28,178
You're gonna be
making out later.

1686
01:07:28,212 --> 01:07:30,247
And now, guys,
this is for you to know.

1687
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,882
Just so you know, as girls,

1688
01:07:31,916 --> 01:07:34,251
we like to make out with you
when we first meet you.

1689
01:07:34,284 --> 01:07:35,820
We like to make out with you
a couple times

1690
01:07:35,853 --> 01:07:37,454
and then leave
right when you think

1691
01:07:37,487 --> 01:07:39,456
we're gonna sleep
with you, okay?

1692
01:07:39,489 --> 01:07:41,158
We do it to make sure
that you like us.

1693
01:07:41,191 --> 01:07:42,492
But if you want to know
the truth,

1694
01:07:42,526 --> 01:07:46,063
they teach us this shit
in high school.

1695
01:07:46,096 --> 01:07:48,265
While you were off building
a birdhouse in shop class,

1696
01:07:48,298 --> 01:07:50,400
we were off learning
how to be annoying.

1697
01:07:50,434 --> 01:07:52,136
Here's how it happens.

1698
01:07:52,169 --> 01:07:53,503
You're gonna be making out.

1699
01:07:53,537 --> 01:07:54,538
And you'll notice
that when a girl

1700
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:55,773
makes out with you
and leaves you,

1701
01:07:55,806 --> 01:07:57,041
we always leave
in a very sweet way

1702
01:07:57,074 --> 01:07:58,575
because we want you to have

1703
01:07:58,608 --> 01:08:00,845
a nice impression of us
for later, right?

1704
01:08:00,878 --> 01:08:02,780
So it's always, like,
"Okay, well, I gotta go.

1705
01:08:02,813 --> 01:08:05,149
"Bye."
No, you didn't. No.

1706
01:08:05,182 --> 01:08:07,952
"Bye. I love you too.
Stop it."

1707
01:08:07,985 --> 01:08:09,720
It's always very sweet, right?

1708
01:08:09,754 --> 01:08:11,521
I've gone as far
as to sometimes bring

1709
01:08:11,555 --> 01:08:12,790
a little thing
of vanilla body spray.

1710
01:08:12,823 --> 01:08:14,324
And when he gets up
to go to the bathroom,

1711
01:08:14,358 --> 01:08:15,625
I spray it on his pillow.

1712
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:16,593
That way, later,
when he texts me,

1713
01:08:16,626 --> 01:08:17,795
he's like, "Oh, my God."

1714
01:08:17,828 --> 01:08:19,563
My pillow still smells
like you."

1715
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:22,232
I'm like, "That's amazing."

1716
01:08:22,266 --> 01:08:23,500
"I don't know why."

1717
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:24,869
You can get creative with it.

1718
01:08:24,902 --> 01:08:26,737
You can take a handful
of glitter on your date.

1719
01:08:26,771 --> 01:08:28,138
And then after you're leaving,
just be, like,

1720
01:08:28,172 --> 01:08:30,307
"Okay, I gotta go."

1721
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:31,842
"Bye."

1722
01:08:31,876 --> 01:08:34,544
You can bring a smoke bomb...

1723
01:08:34,578 --> 01:08:35,913
And then, like,
still be standing there

1724
01:08:35,946 --> 01:08:38,682
'cause you don't know magic.

1725
01:08:38,715 --> 01:08:40,417
Girls always leave
in a sweet way.

1726
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:41,585
We never leave in a huff.

1727
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:43,287
It's never, like,
"Well, I got mine.

1728
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:44,822
Eat my shit later, fuck-tard."

1729
01:08:46,891 --> 01:08:48,725
Never doing that.

1730
01:08:48,759 --> 01:08:50,060
So we're gonna be
making out later.

1731
01:08:50,094 --> 01:08:51,695
And here's how it's gonna go.

1732
01:08:51,728 --> 01:08:52,596
We're gonna be making out, okay?

1733
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:54,865
So this is making out, okay?

1734
01:08:54,899 --> 01:08:56,600
I'm 12, this is what making out
looks like.

1735
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:57,868
And the guy's gonna be, like,

1736
01:08:57,902 --> 01:08:59,603
"Oh, I like making out with you
so much."

1737
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:00,771
"I like making out
with you."

1738
01:09:00,805 --> 01:09:02,773
"Tonight was so fun."
"It was really fun."

1739
01:09:02,807 --> 01:09:03,941
"You're so hot."
"I know."

1740
01:09:03,974 --> 01:09:05,709
"This is so fun.
I really like you.

1741
01:09:05,742 --> 01:09:06,777
You're so pretty."
"I know, this is great.

1742
01:09:06,811 --> 01:09:09,780
I am pretty."
"Oh, I like you a lot.

1743
01:09:09,814 --> 01:09:12,749
So you wanna keep going?"
Girls, that's your cue.

1744
01:09:12,783 --> 01:09:15,352
"All right, well, I gotta go."
"What?"

1745
01:09:15,385 --> 01:09:19,356
"I gotta go, bye."

1746
01:09:19,389 --> 01:09:21,525
"Later."

1747
01:09:21,558 --> 01:09:23,794
And the guy is gonna try

1748
01:09:23,828 --> 01:09:25,930
to get you to stay, right?
As he should.

1749
01:09:25,963 --> 01:09:28,098
You can't just walk
out of a spider's web.

1750
01:09:30,234 --> 01:09:31,802
"You're really gonna go?
Come on. Come on."

1751
01:09:31,836 --> 01:09:35,339
"Amber.
you really gonna go?"

1752
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:40,344
"You really gonna go?"

1753
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:46,283
"Really gonna go?"

1754
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:57,361
"Really just go?
You're just gonna go? Huh?"

1755
01:10:13,944 --> 01:10:15,512
"You're just gonna leave it
like this?"

1756
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:17,848
"I'm sorry.

1757
01:10:17,882 --> 01:10:19,616
"Were we in the middle
of open heart surgery?

1758
01:10:19,649 --> 01:10:20,384
"I'm pretty sure you're fine.

1759
01:10:20,417 --> 01:10:22,052
"Yeah.

1760
01:10:22,086 --> 01:10:24,821
"I'm not a doctor per se,
but I'm fairly confident

1761
01:10:24,855 --> 01:10:26,090
"that blood will return
to your system.

1762
01:10:26,123 --> 01:10:29,393
Walk it off, champ."

1763
01:10:31,361 --> 01:10:32,596
That might sound harsh,

1764
01:10:32,629 --> 01:10:33,931
but it took ten years
of me dating

1765
01:10:33,964 --> 01:10:36,666
to learn that a boner
isn't a medical condition.

1766
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,402
So I'm paying you back
right now.

1767
01:10:42,472 --> 01:10:43,773
Now, he's pissed,

1768
01:10:43,807 --> 01:10:45,509
mostly because he has
a raging erection

1769
01:10:45,542 --> 01:10:47,344
and you called him "champ."

1770
01:10:47,377 --> 01:10:49,313
Now, he's mad.

1771
01:10:49,346 --> 01:10:51,581
"Really? you're gonna go?
That's messed up.

1772
01:10:51,615 --> 01:10:52,917
That's messed up!"

1773
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:54,618
"It's messed up, Amber.
You're just gonna go.

1774
01:10:54,651 --> 01:10:56,053
"Let me...
Just gonna go?

1775
01:10:56,086 --> 01:10:57,955
"It's funny.
It's funny.

1776
01:10:57,988 --> 01:10:59,957
"You're just gonna go
'cause, uh... huh.

1777
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:04,528
I distinctly remember
I bought you a lobster."

1778
01:11:08,899 --> 01:11:12,736
The man's right.
Time to pay the Piper.

1779
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,371
Girls, you do not have
to sleep with him.

1780
01:11:14,404 --> 01:11:18,675
It's just a crustacean.
That's ridiculous, all right?

1781
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:20,945
But you got
to give him something.

1782
01:11:20,978 --> 01:11:23,213
I- I suggest a beej.
That's what I suggest.

1783
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:26,416
That's proper.
Don't do a hand job.

1784
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:28,085
That's ridiculous.
That's child's play.

1785
01:11:30,587 --> 01:11:32,456
Hand job?
A handy? Really?

1786
01:11:32,489 --> 01:11:34,925
As a grown woman, you're not
doing a hand job, okay?

1787
01:11:34,959 --> 01:11:36,426
If you voted,
you're not doing a hand job.

1788
01:11:38,428 --> 01:11:40,931
Let's send some hand jobs
overseas to China.

1789
01:11:44,168 --> 01:11:45,869
Not doing a hand job.

1790
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:47,004
A hand job, who does...
That's what kids do

1791
01:11:47,037 --> 01:11:48,438
when you're, like, a teenager.

1792
01:11:48,472 --> 01:11:50,774
You do a hand job.
You put on your promise ring.

1793
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:53,077
You revel in your virginity
for the next 10 to 15 years

1794
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:54,711
depending on your involvement
with comic books.

1795
01:11:54,744 --> 01:11:56,046
That's what a hand job is for.

1796
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,015
As an adult, it's not happening.

1797
01:11:58,048 --> 01:12:00,150
It's an intermediary step
in a sexual evolution

1798
01:12:00,184 --> 01:12:02,619
that you've evolved past, okay?

1799
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:06,991
It's like a tail...

1800
01:12:07,024 --> 01:12:08,792
Necessary at one point
for balance,

1801
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:09,994
but if you busted it out
at a house party,

1802
01:12:10,027 --> 01:12:12,396
people would be,
like, weirded out.

1803
01:12:17,067 --> 01:12:19,736
I was out with a guy one time
who I wasn't even into.

1804
01:12:19,769 --> 01:12:23,107
I didn't want to do anything.
And he didn't buy me a lobster.

1805
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:24,508
And I was...
I explained everything.

1806
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:26,010
And after talking to him,

1807
01:12:26,043 --> 01:12:28,412
he's like,
"I'd like a hand job."

1808
01:12:29,879 --> 01:12:31,648
"I think
it sounds great."

1809
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:33,350
And I guess I was frustrated

1810
01:12:33,383 --> 01:12:35,719
'cause he hadn't been listening
to me or my feelings.

1811
01:12:35,752 --> 01:12:36,953
And I was like, "All right."

1812
01:12:36,987 --> 01:12:39,789
"I'll tell you what, son.

1813
01:12:39,823 --> 01:12:42,226
"I'm gonna give you a hand job.

1814
01:12:42,259 --> 01:12:43,994
But it's gonna be
on my terms."

1815
01:12:45,629 --> 01:12:48,698
"45 minutes long..."

1816
01:12:52,936 --> 01:12:56,040
"No lotion..."

1817
01:12:58,908 --> 01:13:00,344
"And you don't break
eye contact.

1818
01:13:00,377 --> 01:13:04,048
Go!"

1819
01:13:20,297 --> 01:13:24,068
What kills me is that you get
that I'm kidding.

1820
01:13:24,101 --> 01:13:27,037
He did not.

1821
01:13:27,071 --> 01:13:30,374
I swear to God he goes,
"Aw, no lotion?"

1822
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:34,111
"That doesn't sound fun."

1823
01:13:34,144 --> 01:13:36,346
Like the 45-minute part
is tolerable?

1824
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:40,984
"Iliza, come on.
You gotta do something.

1825
01:13:41,017 --> 01:13:43,453
You gotta give me lotion
or do something cute."

1826
01:13:43,487 --> 01:13:46,256
It threw me off
that he said "cute"

1827
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:48,358
because that's not an adjective
I believe

1828
01:13:48,392 --> 01:13:52,829
belongs anywhere
near an H.J.

1829
01:13:52,862 --> 01:13:54,464
It sounded creepy in a way.

1830
01:13:54,498 --> 01:13:56,233
I was like,
"What do you mean 'cute'?

1831
01:13:56,266 --> 01:13:58,034
"What... what's cute?
What do you want?

1832
01:13:58,068 --> 01:14:00,404
What do you want,
kitten paws?"

1833
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:19,556
It's probably how that one cat
lost his eye.

1834
01:14:19,589 --> 01:14:20,790
You guys are fantastic.

1835
01:14:20,824 --> 01:14:21,758
Thank you so much
for coming out.
