00:00:10,445 --> 00:00:12,316

[cheers and applause]

7
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:25,547

8
00:00:25,547 --> 00:00:29,377
DALLAS, TEXAS!

00:00:29,377 --> 00:00:30,987
THANK YOU.

10
00:00:30,987 --> 00:00:34,947
[cheers and applause]

11
00:00:40,214 --> 00:00:42,694
OH.

12
00:00:42,694 --> 00:00:44,392
HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOING?
THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT, Y'’ALL.

13
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:46,220
FANTASTIC.

14
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,398
I AM SO EXCITED AND HONORED
TO BE SHOOTING MY HOUR SPECIAL

15
00:00:50,398 --> 00:00:52,182
IN MY HOMETOWN
OF DALLAS, TEXAS.

16
00:00:52,182 --> 00:00:54,315
YES, MA'’AM.
[cheers and applause]

17
00:00:54,315 --> 00:00:56,317
[laughs]

18
00:00:56,317 --> 00:00:58,058
I'’M SO EXCITED
TO BE HERE.

19
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,711
NOT THRILLED
WITH GETTING HERE.

20
00:00:59,711 --> 00:01:01,365
I HAVE TO BE HONEST.

21
00:01:01,365 --> 00:01:05,326
I FLY ENOUGH THAT I FEEL
I HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY THIS.

22
00:01:05,326 --> 00:01:07,850
IF YOU WORK
FOR AN AIRLINE,

23
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,026
I HATE YOU.

24
00:01:10,026 --> 00:01:12,028
OKAY?
I HATE YOU.

25
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:13,508
AND I DON'’T WANT
TO HEAR,

26
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:15,336
"NO, MY COUSIN SHEILA'’S
A REAL SWEETHEART.

27
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:16,467
SHE WORKS FOR SOUTHWEST."

28
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:18,034
FUCK YOUR COUSIN SHEILA.

29
00:01:18,034 --> 00:01:20,167
[laughter]

30
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:22,125
ALL RIGHT, YOUR COUSIN SHEILA'’S
A GODDAMN BITCH.

31
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:24,345
AND I'’LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE.

32
00:01:24,345 --> 00:01:26,086
THE ONLY REASON
PEOPLE WORK FOR AIRLINES

33
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,263
IS BECAUSE THE NAZI PARTY
IS NO LONGER HIRING.

34
00:01:29,263 --> 00:01:31,743
[laughter and applause]

35
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:34,137
I DON'’T HAVE AN ISSUE--
THANK YOU.

36
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:35,791
I DON'’T HAVE AN ISSUE
WITH FLYING.

37
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,836
MY ISSUE IS WITH THE BOARDING
OF THE PLANE.

38
00:01:37,836 --> 00:01:40,317
HAS ANYONE ELSE HERE
EVER HAD THE MISFORTUNE

39
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:43,494
OF BEING STUCK
IN BOARDING ZONE FOUR?

40
00:01:43,494 --> 00:01:45,235
LIKE, THAT'’S WHEN
YOU HAVE A SEAT--

41
00:01:45,235 --> 00:01:47,019
YOU HAVE A TICKET
'’CAUSE YOU'’RE HOLDING IT--

42
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:48,760
BUT YOU'’RE SO LOW
ON THE FOOD CHAIN,

43
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,371
IT PRETTY MUCH GOES,
LIKE, FIRST-CLASS,

44
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:52,677
LUGGAGE, TERRORISTS,
MAYBE YOU.

45
00:01:52,677 --> 00:01:55,071
[laughter]

46
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:57,334
AND THEY TAKE
SUCH PAINSTAKING CARE

47
00:01:57,334 --> 00:01:58,988
TO BOARD ZONES
ONE THROUGH THREE.

48
00:01:58,988 --> 00:02:01,033
AND IF YOU DON'’T FLY
THAT AIRLINE OFTEN ENOUGH,

49
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:02,644
YOU ARE S.O.L. IN TERMS
OF GETTING ON THAT PLANE

50
00:02:02,644 --> 00:02:04,472
'’CAUSE THEY ARE BOARDING GROUPS
OF PEOPLE

51
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:05,777
THAT YOU DIDN'’T EVEN KNOW

52
00:02:05,777 --> 00:02:09,041
YOU COULD APPLY
TO BE PART OF.

53
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,348
WE'’RE GONNA START BOARDING
FLIGHT 556 TO DALLAS/FORT WORTH.

RIGHT THIS WAY.

60
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,143
OUR GOLDEN EAGLE MEMBERS,
OUR EAGLE FACE MEMBERS.

61
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,232
IF YOU HAVE AN EAGLE FACE
INSTEAD OF A PERSON FACE

62
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:27,625
'’CAUSE YOU LOST
YOUR FACE

63
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:30,280
IN SOME SORT OF HORRIBLE HOLIDAY
TURKEY DEEP FRY ACCIDENT,

64
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,586
YOU DIDN'’T HAVE
ENOUGH BUTT FAT

65
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:33,327
TO GET A NOSE GRAFTED
ONTO YOUR FACE,

66
00:02:33,327 --> 00:02:34,850
SO YOU HAD TO BORROW ONE
FROM AN EAGLE,

67
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:35,851
SO NOW YOU HAVE A BEAK,
AND YOU LIKE TO EAT MICE,

68
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:37,505
YOU CAN GET ON THE PLANE.

69

IF ANYBODY LIKES COMIC BOOKS,
YOU'’RE A FUCKIN'’ NERD.

72
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:43,989
YOU CAN SIT IN THE BACK
OF THE PLANE.

73
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:45,904
SILVER HAIR, IF YOU'’RE OLD,
HURRY THE FUCK UP.

74
00:02:45,904 --> 00:02:47,906
SILVER SPOONS, IF YOU LIKE
RICKY SCHRODER, '’80s TV SHOWS,

75
00:02:47,906 --> 00:02:49,604
YOU WERE BORN REALLY WEALTHY,
YOU CAN GET ON THE PLANE.

SILVER BULLET SUMMER--
NO, MA'’AM, YOU CANNOT BRING

77
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,563

IS ANYBODY USING
A DURACELL-OPERATED DEVICE?

83
00:03:04,488 --> 00:03:05,663
I DON'’T GIVE A SHIT
IF IT'’S A PACEMAKER.

84
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:06,664
YOU TURN THAT OFF
FOR TAKEOFF.

85
00:03:06,664 --> 00:03:07,970
COPPERHEAD.

86
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,624
IF YOU HAVE A COPPERHEAD SNAKE
AS A PET

87
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:11,539
INSTEAD OF A NORMAL GODDAMN PET
LIKE A DOG OR A CAT,

88
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:13,236
YOU'’RE LIKE, "FUCK IT,
I'’M GONNA GET ME A SNAKE.

89
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:15,456
"YEAH, FUCK YOU, DAD.
I'’M NOT GOING TO LAW SCHOOL.

90
00:03:15,456 --> 00:03:17,109
"I'’M GONNA GO
TO ART SCHOOL ONLINE

"AND LEARN
HOW TO DRAW DRAGONS

"AND MANAGE A HOT TOPIC
IN MY SPARE TIME.

00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:24,987
"I LOVE HER SO MUCH.
DON'’T TOUCH ME, MOM."

97
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:26,554
YOU GET
ON THE PLANE.

98
00:03:26,554 --> 00:03:29,644
AND BOARDING ZONE FOUR,
YOU CAN GO FUCK YOURSELF.

00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:35,519
[cheers and applause]

100
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:39,393
NOW BOARDING ALL ZONES.

101
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:40,698
[laughter]

102
00:03:40,698 --> 00:03:42,831
I SPEND
A LOT OF TIME TRAVELING.

103
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:44,702
SPEND A LOT OF TIME
IN HOTELS.

104
00:03:44,702 --> 00:03:46,878
AND AS A RESULT OF IT,
I WATCH A LOT OF TV.

105
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:48,358
AND I THINK
THE SADDEST COMMERCIAL OUT THERE

106
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:52,797
HAS TO BE THE S.P.C.A.
SARAH MCLACHLAN AD.

107
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:54,451
SEEN IT?

108
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:57,541
WITH THE FUCKED UP ANIMALS?

109
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,283
CAN I TELL YOU A SECRET
ABOUT THIS COMMERCIAL?

110
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:03,634
IT KNOWS
WHEN YOU'’RE ALONE.

111
00:04:03,634 --> 00:04:05,027
[laughter]

112
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:06,898
DO YOU EVER NOTICE
IT ONLY COMES ON

113
00:04:06,898 --> 00:04:09,249
WHEN YOU'’RE BY YOURSELF,
MAYBE YOU'’RE DRUNK?

114
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,295
YOU'’RE VULNERABLE, RIGHT?

115
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:13,601
AND WHAT'’S CRAZY
IS AT FIRST,

116
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:16,038
YES, YOU ARE SAD
FOR THE ANIMALS.

117
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:17,692
BUT THE LONGER
YOU WATCH IT,

118
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:20,956
THE LONGER YOUR SADNESS
KIND OF BEGINS TO TURN ON YOU,

119
00:04:20,956 --> 00:04:22,305
AND BY THE END OF IT,
SOMEHOW,

120
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:26,004
YOU JUST FEEL REALLY BAD
FOR YOURSELF?

121
00:04:26,004 --> 00:04:28,137
YOU'’RE SITTING THERE,
LIKE, "OH, MY GOD.

122
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:30,574
THERE'’S--THAT CAT
DOESN'’T HAVE A FACE."

123
00:04:30,574 --> 00:04:32,924
I DON'’T KNOW.
"I'’M SO SAD.

124
00:04:32,924 --> 00:04:34,317
"I FEEL SO BAD
FOR HIM.

125
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:36,014
"AND I FEEL SO BAD
FOR HIS CAT FAMILY.

126
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:39,409
AND I FEEL SO BAD FOR...
ME."

127
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:42,282
[cries]

128
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,326
"OH, GOD.
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

129
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:44,762
"WHAT SHOULD I DO?

130
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:47,548
I SHOULD--I SHOULD--
I SHOULD GET A CAT."

131
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:48,984
SO YOU GET A CAT.

132
00:04:48,984 --> 00:04:51,116
BUT BECAUSE HE'’S
FROM THE S.P.C.A.,

133
00:04:51,116 --> 00:04:54,729
LIKE, LET'’S BE HONEST, HE'’S ALL,
LIKE, FUCKED UP AND AUTISTIC.

134
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,339
JUST SHITS EVERYWHERE.

135
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:59,255
YOU'’RE LIKE, "OH, MY GOD.
WHAT DID YOU EAT?"

136
00:04:59,255 --> 00:05:00,865
GOES THROUGH YOUR STUFF.

137
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:03,825
HE ONLY EATS THE BUTTONS
OFF YOUR GOOD SWEATERS.

138
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:05,522
YOU'’RE LIKE, "HOW DID YOU KNOW
TO GO TO FOR THE GOOD SWEATERS?

139
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:06,915
"WHY DIDN'’T YOU GO
FOR THE CRAPPY SWEATERS?

140
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:10,571
WHY DO YOU HAVE
SUCH EXQUISITE TASTE?"

141
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:13,051
GOTTA GET RID OF HIM
'’CAUSE HE'’S RUINING EVERYTHING.

142
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:15,793
BUT WHAT DO YOU DO?
YOU CAN'’T KILL HIM BECAUSE--

143
00:05:15,793 --> 00:05:18,579
BECAUSE THAT'’S FUCKING INSANE,
I GUESS.

144
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:19,797
BUT YOU GOTTA GET RID OF HIM.
SO WHAT DO YOU DO?

145
00:05:19,797 --> 00:05:20,929
I'’M GONNA TELL YOU.

146
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:23,018
YOU PUT KITTY
IN THE CAR.

147
00:05:23,018 --> 00:05:24,976
YOU DRIVE HIM TO A NEIGHBORHOOD
HE DOESN'’T KNOW.

148
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:27,675
[laughter]

149
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:30,373
YOU LET HIM
OUT OF THE CAR.

150
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:31,722
DON'’T WORRY.

151
00:05:31,722 --> 00:05:36,205
THE S.P.C.A.
WILL FIND THAT CAT.

152
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:37,772
I DON'’T KNOW
IF YOU'’VE NOTICED.

153
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:42,037
THEY'’RE IN THE BUSINESS
OF SECONDHAND CATTERY.

154
00:05:42,037 --> 00:05:44,213
THEY FIND THE CAT.
THEY CLEAN HIM OFF.

155
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:47,869
THEY UPDATE HIS RESUME.

156
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:49,958
HE GETS A JOB MANAGING,
LIKE, A CHIPOTLE.

157
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,787
HE'’S FINE,
ALL RIGHT?

158
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:54,397
SO IN HONOR
OF THAT COMMERCIAL,

159
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:57,269
I HAVE A TREAT
FOR YOU GUYS.

160
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:03,058
[cheers and applause]

161
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:06,104
THIS IS MY CAT.

162
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:10,021
[laughter]

163
00:06:10,021 --> 00:06:14,504
[cheers and applause]

164
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,511
THIS IS MY DOG BLANCHE,
AND I ADOPTED HER.

165
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:23,208
AND SOMETIMES WHEN YOU ADOPT
AN ANIMAL,

166
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,558
YOU DON'’T KNOW
THEIR BACK STORY.

167
00:06:24,558 --> 00:06:28,562
SO FOR BLANCHE,
I MADE ONE UP.

168
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:31,042
IN MY HOUSE,
WE PRETEND THAT BLANCHE

169
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:33,784
USED TO BE
A DOG PROSTITUTE...

170
00:06:33,784 --> 00:06:39,224
[laughter]

171
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:43,925
[cheers and applause]

172
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:45,970
WHICH MAKES SENSE,
BECAUSE AS YOU CAN TELL,

173
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,452
SHE'’S A LITTLE SAD
BEHIND THE EYES...

174
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:50,801
BUT SHE CLEARLY
HAS NO PROBLEM

175
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:52,281
WITH YOU STARING
AT HER DOG VAGINA.

176
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:58,200
[laughter]

177
00:07:00,942 --> 00:07:04,424
MAKE IT RAIN.

178
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,470
SHAKE IT
FOR THE MONEY.

179
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,081
SO IN HONOR OF THAT COMMERCIAL,
SHE AND I ARE NOW GOING TO DO

180
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:11,605
OUR RENDITION OF IT
FOR YOU.

181
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:14,869
HERE WE GO.

182
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:16,958
[laughter]

183
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,961
[singing]
IN THE ARMS

184
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:23,834
OF THE ANGEL,

185
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:28,186
FAR AWAY

186
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:30,972
FROM HERE,

187
00:07:30,972 --> 00:07:36,586
IN THIS DARK,
COLD HOTEL ROOM,

188
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:38,806
AND THE END,

189
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:42,679
DAH, DAH, DAH, DAH, DAH

190
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:48,380
YOU WERE PULLED--
[chuckles]

191
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,340
THAT'’S IT.
THAT'’S IT FOR BLANCHE.

192
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:57,346
[cheers and applause]

193
00:07:57,346 --> 00:07:58,782
LET'’S GET SERIOUS.

194
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:00,349
MY DOG IS SO CUTE,
I WANT TO HURT HER.

195
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:02,090
DO YOU EVER GET THAT WAY?

196
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,874
WHEN SOMETHING IS SO CUTE,
IT MAKES YOU ANGRY.

197
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:06,007
I JUST WANT TO RIP ITS NOSE
AND--[growls]

198
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:07,748
YOU EVER GET THAT WAY
WHEN SOMETHING IS SO CUTE,

199
00:08:07,748 --> 00:08:09,140
YOU DON'’T KNOW IF YOU CAN
TRUST YOURSELF AROUND IT?

200
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,490
I USED TO GET THAT WAY
WITH MY NANA.

201
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,143
SHE'’S, LIKE, THIS TALL,
AND YOU EVER HUG

202
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:13,580
YOUR GRANDPARENT,
AND YOU'’RE, LIKE, "OH, MY GOD,

203
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,755
I JUST WANNA PUSH YOU
DOWN THE STAIRS."

204
00:08:14,755 --> 00:08:17,192
YOU EVER FEEL THAT WAY?

205
00:08:17,192 --> 00:08:18,541
YOU EVER FEEL THE URGE,
JUST, "WHAT IF I JUST--"

206
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,891
[growls]
"JUST FEEL LIKE..."

207
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:22,589
HYPOTHETICALLY.
[sighs]

208
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:24,852
SOMETIMES, I GET THAT WAY
AROUND GARBAGE DISPOSALS.

209
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:27,115
YOU EVER JUST PUT YOUR HAND IN
JUST TO FEEL THE--FEEL THE FEAR?

210
00:08:27,115 --> 00:08:29,030
[groans]

211
00:08:31,162 --> 00:08:32,860
YOU REACH
THE OTHER HAND OVER.

212
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,339
YOU DON'’T TOUCH THE SWITCH,
BUT YOU HOVER AROUND IT?

213
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:35,297
YOU'’RE LIKE,
"WHAT IF I JUST..."

214
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:36,559
[groans]
"NO!"

215
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,257
[grunts]

216
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:43,131
I DON'’T DO THAT EITHER.
IT WAS JUST A JOKE.

217
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:45,612
SOMETIMES YOU GET THAT WAY
WITH CUTE THINGS, LIKE BABIES.

218
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:47,091
SOMETIMES BABIES
ARE SO CUTE.

219
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:48,528
SOMETIMES BABIES
ARE NOT SO CUTE.

220
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,355
BUT SOMETIMES BABIES--
SO CUTE,

221
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:51,705
YOU KNOW,
FAT, LITTLE, BABY CHEEK.

222
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:54,142
YOU JUST WANT
TO RIP HIS CHEEK OFF.

223
00:08:54,142 --> 00:08:58,842
[laughter]

224
00:08:58,842 --> 00:09:00,235
BUT YOU CAN'’T
'’CAUSE YOU WON'’T

225
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:01,628
BE ALLOWED
AROUND THE BABY ANYMORE.

226
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:04,021
THAT'’S FOR GODDAMN SURE.

227
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:05,762
THERE WAS ANOTHER VERSION
OF THAT COMMERCIAL.

228
00:09:05,762 --> 00:09:08,460
WHAT HAPPENED WAS THEY AIRED
THAT COMMERCIAL.

229
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,159
AND IT WAS SUCH A HIT, SO MANY
PEOPLE WERE ADOPTING PETS,

230
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,074
SO MANY PEOPLE
WERE DONATING MONEY,

231
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:17,252
SO MANY PEOPLE WERE
GOING ON ANTIDEPRESSANTS.

232
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:18,862
AND THEY WERE LIKE,
"LET'’S DO ANOTHER ONE."

233
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:21,125
SO THEY TRIED TO RECREATE
THE MAGIC OF THAT ONE.

234
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,649
SO IN THIS COMMERCIAL,
THEY PLAY

235
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:24,476
ANOTHER SARAH MCLACHLAN SONG,
OKAY?

236
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:28,045
I DON'’T KNOW THE SONG,
BUT IT'’S SOME LESBIAN CHANT.

237
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:29,046
THAT'’S HAPPENING.

238
00:09:29,046 --> 00:09:31,179
[laughter]

239
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:34,095
AND THEY ZOOM IN
ON THESE PICTURES

240
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:35,444
OF THESE JACKED UP ANIMALS.

241
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:37,098
AND AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE SCREEN,

242
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:40,492
THEY PUT A CAPTION
OF WHAT THE ANIMAL IS THINKING?

243
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:42,712
[laughter]

244
00:09:42,712 --> 00:09:46,586
NOW, WHERE THEY GOT
THAT INFORMATION, I DON'’T KNOW.

245
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,675
THEY SHOW A DOG,
AND HE'’S ALL NO TEETH.

246
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:52,287
HE'’S JUST AWFUL-LOOKING,
LIKE, "NAH!"

247
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:54,028
"WHERE'’S MY FAMILY?"

248
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:56,334
"I DON'’T KNOW!"

249
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:58,380
[mouths words]

250
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,512
THEY SHOW ANOTHER DOG,
AND HE'’S ALL MUDDY AND GNARLY.

251
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:03,254
HE'’S JUST, "NAH!"

252
00:10:03,254 --> 00:10:05,126
"I HOPE THEY COME BACK
FOR ME."

253
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:07,302
"NAH!

254
00:10:07,302 --> 00:10:09,391
"DAD, YOU SAID YOU WAS
GOING FOR CIGARETTES.

255
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:11,872
"WHY?

256
00:10:11,872 --> 00:10:14,744
IT'’S ME, SPOT."

257
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:16,267
AND THEN,
THEY SHOWED A CAT.

258
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:18,661
AND THIS CAT WAS,
LIKE, 45 POUNDS.

259
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:21,751
IT--IT HAD ONE EYE.
[all aw]

260
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:23,405
AND IT TURNED--
DO YOU KNOW HIM?

261
00:10:23,405 --> 00:10:26,582
AND IT TURNED AROUND--
HE TURNED AROUND IN SLOW MOTION,

262
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:28,105
AND IT WASN'’T
A CAMERA TRICK.

263
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:31,108
HE'’S JUST, LIKE,
A 45-POUND CAT, I GUESS.

264
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:32,588
HE DOESN'’T HAVE,
LIKE, A MEETING TO RUSH TO.

265
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:33,763
SO HE'’S NOT...

266
00:10:33,763 --> 00:10:39,639
[groaning]

267
00:10:42,206 --> 00:10:47,429
[laughter]

268
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:54,305
"I'’M SORRY
FOR WHATEVER I DID WRONG."

269
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:56,264
NO, THAT'’S WHERE I STOPPED
BUYING THAT COMMERCIAL.

270
00:10:56,264 --> 00:10:58,745
THERE'’S NO WAY
A CAT HAS REMORSE.

271
00:10:58,745 --> 00:11:00,268
[laughter]

272
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:01,661
YOU EVER MET A CAT?

273
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,097
THERE'’S NO WAY
HE'’S APOLOGETIC.

274
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:04,794
WHATEVER THAT CAT DID
TO LAND HIM IN CAT JAIL,

275
00:11:04,794 --> 00:11:06,274
HE'’S NOT SORRY
HE DID IT.

276
00:11:06,274 --> 00:11:07,579
HE'’S SORRY
HE GOT CAUGHT.

277
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:10,757
THERE'’S A DIFFERENCE.

278
00:11:10,757 --> 00:11:15,718
[cheers and applause]

279
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:17,241
THAT CAT'’S AS HARD AS THEY COME.
HE DOESN'’T GIVE A SHIT.

280
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:19,200
HE'’S SITTING THERE
IN HIS LITTLE CAT CELL.

281
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,725
HE'’S GOT "MEOW MIX FOR LIFE"
TATTOOED ON HIS LITTLE BELLY.

282
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:24,684
HE'’S GOT A LITTLE RAT
THAT HE'’S MADE HIS BITCH.

283
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,990
IT'’S CARVING A SHIV
OUT OF CHEESE IN THE CORNER.

284
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,775
HE'’S GOT
ONE SHARPENED CAT CLAW.

285
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:31,168
HE'’S JUST RUNNING IT
AGAINST THE BARS, LIKE, "BRR.

286
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:33,214
BRR."

287
00:11:33,214 --> 00:11:34,302
OH, YEAH, HE'’S GOT ONE EYE.
I FORGOT.

288
00:11:34,302 --> 00:11:36,870
"BRR.
BRR."

289
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,393
HE'’S LIKE, "HEAR ME?"
[spits]

290
00:11:38,393 --> 00:11:41,222
"I DON'’T GIVE A FUCK."
[meowing]

291
00:11:41,222 --> 00:11:42,702
"YOU THINK I CARE?

292
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,747
"OH, HELL, YEAH,
I SCRATCHED UP YOUR CURTAINS.

293
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:47,054
AND I'’D DO IT AGAIN.
FUCK YOU."

294
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:48,795
[laughter]

295
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:51,319
THIS IS A CAT PAW.

296
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:55,540
[laughter and applause]

297
00:11:58,282 --> 00:12:00,067
THAT COMMERCIAL
IS SAD.

298
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:01,895
THE COMMERCIAL THAT MAKES ME
FEEL THE WORST ABOUT MYSELF,

299
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:05,986
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY, WOULD BE
THE P90X COMMERCIALS.

300
00:12:05,986 --> 00:12:09,946
THAT COMMERCIAL ALWAYS COMES ON
WHEN I'’M EATING...

301
00:12:09,946 --> 00:12:11,382
[laughter]

302
00:12:11,382 --> 00:12:13,036
WHICH IS THE WORST TIME

303
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:15,038
FOR ANY FITNESS COMMERCIAL
COMES ON '’CAUSE IT KNOWS

304
00:12:15,038 --> 00:12:17,127
WHEN YOU'’RE SITTING THERE
BEING A LITTLE FATTY,

305
00:12:17,127 --> 00:12:18,694
EATIN'’ GRAHAM CRACKERS
WITH YOUR SHIRT OFF,

306
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:19,869
WATCHING "LAW & ORDER: SVU."

307
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:22,132
IT KNOWS.

308
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:24,569
AND IT COMES ON, AND IT GETS
YOU, YOU'’RE JUST SITTIN'’ THERE.

309
00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:25,832
YOU'’RE LIKE,
"I'’LL NEVER FIND LOVE.

310
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:27,964
I DON'’T KNOW.
I DON'’T--"

311
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:29,749
[mimics static]
"DO YOU WANT TO GET IN SHAPE?"

312
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,361
YOU'’RE LIKE...
[gasps]

313
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:36,059
[laughter]

314
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:38,322
AND BY THE WAY,
IT'’S NOT ASKING YOU

315
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:41,021
IF YOU WANT TO GET
IN REGULAR-PERSON SHAPE.

316
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:42,544
IT'’S NOT TALKING
TO NORMAL PEOPLE.

317
00:12:42,544 --> 00:12:44,198
IT'’S TALKING
TO, LIKE, NAVY SEALS.

318
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:45,895
IT'’S TALKING
TO CRAZY PEOPLE.

319
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:47,984
IT'’S NOT ASKING YOU
IF YOU WANT TO LOOK MEDIOCRE

320
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:49,638
WHEN YOU GO TO THE POOL
THIS SUMMER, UH-UH.

321
00:12:49,638 --> 00:12:51,379
IT'’S JUST FOR CRAZY--
IT'’S SAYING,

322
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:54,034
"HEY, FAGGOT, DO YOU WANT TO GET

341
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:35,205
MY QUESTION IS WHY?

342
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:37,468
WHY WOULD
THE AVERAGE GUY

343
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:40,036
WANT TO GET THAT JACKED
THAT FAST?

344

BE THE STRONGEST MANAGER

WITH THAT MUSCLE?

347
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:51,134
YOU WORK IN SALES.
YOU'’RE NOT GUARDING SPARTA.

351
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:01,188
I THINK P90X HAS
A SUBLIMINAL MESSAGE

352
00:14:01,188 --> 00:14:03,233
THAT A LOT OF US
ARE MISSING

'’CAUSE I DON'’T THINK THEY'’RE
TALKING TO REGULAR PEOPLE.

354
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:08,108
I THINK THE COMMERCIAL NEEDS
TO BE HONEST AND COME CLEAN

355
00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:10,545
AND SAY WHAT THEIR PRODUCT
IS REALLY MEANT FOR.

356
00:14:10,545 --> 00:14:12,373
THE COMMERCIAL
SHOULD SOUND LIKE THIS.

357

"HEY, P90X GUY HERE.

ANY JOB--

IF I COULD HAVE ANY JOB,
I WOULD BE A CAT.

BUT THAT IS
NOT SOMETHING

00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:30,892
I'’M SUPPOSED

IF I COULD HAVE ANY JOB
BESIDES THIS,

482

SOMETHING COOL TO IT.

I WOULD BE, LIKE, A DIFFERENT
KIND OF PHARMACIST, OKAY?

486

SO I WOULD
DO IT DIFFERENTLY, OKAY?

SO--SO I WOULD LOOK
LIKE A PHARMACIST.

488
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:47,213
I WOULD WEAR
THE WHITE COAT,

492
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,611
I'’D WEAR THE WHITE COAT,
BUT UNDER IT,

I WOULD GO TO, LIKE,
A RENAISSANCE FAIR.

494
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:58,180
WE HAVE RENAISSANCE FAIRS HERE?
all: YEAH.

00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,487
- YES! OF COURSE WE DO.
EVERY STATE'’S GOT WHITE TRASH.

00:19:06,493 --> 00:19:09,278
AND I WOULD GET ONE OF THOSE,
LIKE, MEDIEVAL WITCH WOMAN BELTS

499
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:10,714
THAT HAS,
LIKE, SOME LEATHER.

500
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:13,021
AND IT'’S GOT BELLS
AND RACCOON PELTS

501
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:15,458
AND A JUG
FOR YOUR ALE, WHATEVER.

502
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,895
AND IT'’D HAVE, LIKE, A JAR
OF PIGEON WHISPERERS.

503
00:19:17,895 --> 00:19:19,680
I'’D HAVE ALL THESE THINGS,
ALL THE ACCOUTREMENT

504
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,464
OF A CREEPY WITCH
ON MY BELT.

505
00:19:21,464 --> 00:19:23,510
AND I'’D PUT IT UNDER THE COAT
SO THAT WHEN I WALKED,

506
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,642
THE COAT WOULD FLARE OPEN,
AND YOU'’D GET GLIMPSES

507
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:27,209
OF MY MEDIEVAL TRICKERY
UNDER IT.

508
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:29,429
JUST--
[blows]

509
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:31,344
AND YOU'’D BE IN LINE
AT THE PHARMACY.

510
00:19:31,344 --> 00:19:33,128
AND YOU'’D BE LIKE, "WHAT'’S UP
WITH THAT ONE PHARMACIST?

511
00:19:33,128 --> 00:19:34,738
"IS SHE INTO THE DARK ARTS?

512
00:19:34,738 --> 00:19:36,697
"IS SHE A SORCERESS?
MAGIC WITH A '’K'’?

513
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:39,569
DOES SHE PLAY "SKYRIM" ALONE?
WHAT IS THAT?"

514
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:41,702
[blows]

515
00:19:41,702 --> 00:19:43,138
AND I WOULDN'’T COME UP
TO THE COUNTER.

516
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:45,227
INSTEAD--INSTEAD OF A BELL
THAT YOU RING,

517
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,011
I WOULD GET--
I WOULD GET A RAVEN.

518
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:49,666
I WOULD STUFF A RAVEN.

519
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,842
AND I WOULD GIVE IT A BEARD.
I'’D GLUE ON THE BEARD.

520
00:19:51,842 --> 00:19:53,714
I WOULD SPEND MY TIME
GLUING THE BEARD ON,

521
00:19:53,714 --> 00:19:55,368
AND IT WOULD HAVE A BEARD, AND
I WOULD SIT HIM ON THE PERCH,

522
00:19:55,368 --> 00:19:57,108
SO WHEN YOU CAME UP
TO THE COUNTER,

523
00:19:57,108 --> 00:19:58,545
YOU'’D HAVE
TO PULL THE BEARD.

524
00:19:58,545 --> 00:20:02,375
AND THEN THE RAVEN WILL GO...
[squawks]

525
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,638
THAT'’S MY CUE TO APPEAR.
[squawks]

526
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:08,294
AND THEN I'’D--PFFT.
YES?

527
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:10,905
SECRETLY, I WAS WAITING UNDER
THE COUNTER TO HEAR THE RAVEN.

528
00:20:10,905 --> 00:20:13,299
AND THEN--PFFT.
YES?

529
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:14,256
I WAS RIGHT THERE.
THERE'’S NO MAGIC.

530
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:15,562
I'’M RIGHT THERE.

531
00:20:15,562 --> 00:20:17,694
[in elderly woman voice]
YES, MY CHILD?

532
00:20:17,694 --> 00:20:19,696
[normal voice]
I CALL YOU MY CHILD

533
00:20:19,696 --> 00:20:21,611
'’CAUSE THAT'’S WHAT
CREEPY PEOPLE DO.

534
00:20:21,611 --> 00:20:23,309
[in elderly woman voice]
YES?

535
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:24,614
[normal voice] AND YOU'’D HAND ME
YOUR PRESCRIPTION.

536
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:27,791
AND I'’D SAY,
"OKAY, ONE MOMENT."

537
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,490
AND I'’D HAVE A HUMP.
OH, YEAH, I HAVE A HUMP.

538
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,839
YOU GOTTA HAVE A HUMP.

539
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:32,883
IF YOU'’RE GONNA BE
MAKING MEDICINE,

540
00:20:32,883 --> 00:20:34,581
YOU GOTTA HAVE A HUMP

541
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:37,497
'’CAUSE THE HUMP SAYS
THAT YOU'’RE SERIOUS.

542
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:38,933
A HUMP
IS YOUR CALLING CARD.

543
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:40,935
A HUMP SAYS,
"I'’M NOT OUT PARTYING.

544
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:42,110
"I'’M NOT OUT
GETTING DRUNK.

545
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,286
"I'’M DOWNSTAIRS
IN THE BASEMENT

DOING THESE THINGS, OKAY?"

552
00:20:55,993 --> 00:20:57,908
SO I HAVE THE HUMP,
AND THEN--

553
00:20:57,908 --> 00:20:59,954
AND THEN, I'’D TAKE YOUR--
I'’D TAKE YOUR PRESCRIPTION.

'’CAUSE THE LIMP

557
00:21:08,658 --> 00:21:11,226
COMES WITH THE HUMP,
STANDARD.

558
00:21:11,226 --> 00:21:12,880
[sighs]

559
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,361
AND THEN I WOULD SET TO WORK
MAKING YOUR MEDICINE.

560
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:17,363
SO I'’D BE BACK HERE,
AND I WOULD HAVE MY BACK TO YOU.

561
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:19,321
AND I'’D--I'’D HAVE
ALL THESE SOUND EFFECTS

562
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:22,106
ON, LIKE, A KEYBOARD READY,
SO YOU WOULD BE STANDING THERE.

563
00:21:22,106 --> 00:21:23,107

565
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:26,067
[mimics animals squealing]

566
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:27,895
[mimics thud]
"EH, ONE MOMENT."

567
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:31,333
[mimics bleating, thud,
and animals squealing]

568
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,467
AND I WOULD ALSO HAVE
A CLOSED-CIRCUIT TV RIGHT HERE,

569
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:37,731
SO I COULD WATCH EVERYTHING
IN THE PHARMACY, OKAY?

570
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:39,472
SO YOU WOULD GO TO,
LIKE, TOUCH SOMETHING,

571
00:21:39,472 --> 00:21:40,777
AND I WOULD SEE YOU
ON THE TV.

572
00:21:40,777 --> 00:21:42,518
AND I WOULD
JUST SAY THIS,

573
00:21:42,518 --> 00:21:45,478
"I WOULDN'’T TOUCH THAT
IF I WERE YOU."

574
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:48,394
[chuckles]
BUT I'’M JUST WATCHING YOU.

575
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:50,265
AND I HAVE--
AND, LIKE, AN HOUR LATER,

576
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:52,789
I'’D EMERGE WITH YOUR MEDICINE

577
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:54,182
IN THE ORANGE BOTTLE.

578
00:21:54,182 --> 00:21:55,401
LIKE, I DIDN'’T MAKE
YOUR SHIT.

579
00:21:55,401 --> 00:21:57,577
I HAD IT READY TO GO.

580
00:21:57,577 --> 00:22:00,319
I WAS JUST WASTING YOUR TIME...

581
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,711
'’CAUSE A HUMP SUGGESTS
THAT I'’M MAKING IT,

582
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:03,713
SO I WANT YOU
TO FOLLOW THAT FANTASY.

583
00:22:03,713 --> 00:22:05,889
I DIDN'’T--I DON'’T KNOW HOW
TO MAKE MEDICINE OUT OF HERBS.

584
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:06,890
I'’M NOT CHINESE.

585
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:10,546
SO I HAVE IT.

586
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:12,026
AND I'’D COME UP
TO THE COUNTER.

587
00:22:12,026 --> 00:22:13,767
AND I'’D SAY--
AND I'’D SET IT DOWN.

588
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:17,858
AND I'’D SAY, "WOULD YOU LIKE
A CONSULTATION?"

589
00:22:17,858 --> 00:22:20,208
[laughter]

590
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,862
AND YOU'’D SAY, "SURE."
AND I'’D SAY, "OKAY."

591
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:23,603
AND I'’D HOLD UP YOUR PILL
TO THE LIGHT.

592
00:22:23,603 --> 00:22:25,344
I SHOULDN'’T TOUCH YOUR MEDICINE,
BUT I'’M GOING TO.

593
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,085
I'’D HOLD IT UP, AND I'’D SAY,
"TAKE ONE!"

594
00:22:28,085 --> 00:22:29,913
[mimicking echoes]
ONE, ONE.

595
00:22:29,913 --> 00:22:31,611
AND I'’D HAVE ALL THE OTHER
PHARMACISTS FLIP THE LIGHTS

596
00:22:31,611 --> 00:22:33,874
ON AND OFF TO MAKE IT...

597
00:22:33,874 --> 00:22:35,223
AND THEY'’D PUT LIGHTERS UP
TO THE SPRINKLERS.

598
00:22:35,223 --> 00:22:36,442
AND WE'’D GET
ONE OF THE FOG MACHINES

599
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:37,530
LEFT OVER
FROM OUR HALLOWEEN SALE.

600
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,661
AND PFFT,

601
00:22:38,661 --> 00:22:40,228
AND IT WOULD
FILL THE ROOM.

602
00:22:40,228 --> 00:22:42,099
AND WE'’D HAVE PEOPLE
WAFTING IT WITH CAR MATS

603
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:44,711
JUST TO MAKE IT GO
IN SOME SORT OF CIRCLE.

604

"TAKE ONE

00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:53,154
IT'’S TWO DIFFERENT TIMES A YEAR,
BUT IT'’S JUST A BIT.

607
00:22:53,154 --> 00:22:56,766
"TAKE ONE

00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,255
I GIVE IT TO YOU,
AND AS YOU ARE GOING TO LEAVE,

613
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:08,212
YOU DIDN'’T
EVEN SAY ANYTHING.

614
00:23:08,212 --> 00:23:09,823
I'’D SAY, "WAIT!"

615
00:23:09,823 --> 00:23:12,347
I GRAB YOU...

616
00:23:12,347 --> 00:23:14,567
GRAB YOU
WITH A GRABBING HAND.

617
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:16,177
WHAT'’S A GRABBING HAND?
I'’M GONNA TELL YOU.

618
00:23:16,177 --> 00:23:17,613
YOU CAN'’T--
IF YOU'’RE GONNA GRAB SOMEONE

619
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:19,441
AND YOU WANT TO INSTILL FEAR
IN THEIR HEARTS,

620
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:20,790
YOU CAN'’T GRAB
WITH A WELL-MANICURED HAND

621
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,835
WITH, LIKE,
A PRETTY RING.

622
00:23:21,835 --> 00:23:23,619
NO ONE'’S
GONNA BE AFRAID.

623
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:24,577
IF I GRAB YOU WITH THIS HAND,
YOU'’D BE LIKE, "WHAT?

624
00:23:24,577 --> 00:23:25,795
THAT SOUNDS AWESOME."

625
00:23:25,795 --> 00:23:27,536
IT'’S GOT
TO BE CREEPY, OKAY?

626
00:23:27,536 --> 00:23:28,885
SOMEONE GRABS YOU
OUT OF A GRAVE.

627
00:23:28,885 --> 00:23:30,844
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?
IT'’S SINEWY.

628
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:32,454
IT'’S GOT DIRTY NAILS.
IT'’S ALL "THRILLER"-LOOKING.

629
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:34,804
JUST NAH!
GONNA GRAB HIM.

630
00:23:34,804 --> 00:23:35,979
HOW DO YOU MAKE
A GRABBING HAND?

631
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:37,198
I'’M GOING
TO TELL YOU.

632
00:23:37,198 --> 00:23:38,373
YOU PUT YOUR HAND
OUTSIDE YOUR CAR

633
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:40,157
FOR TWO HOURS A DAY,

634
00:23:40,157 --> 00:23:44,074
SO IT TANS QUICKER
THAN THE REST OF YOU.

635
00:23:44,074 --> 00:23:46,033
YOU TAKE SPECIAL LIVER PILLS
THAT PREVENT YOUR LIVER

636
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:47,469
FROM FUNCTIONING
ON THIS SIDE.

637
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:50,429
SO YOU START TO GET LIVER SPOTS
ALL OVER, OKAY?

638
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,560
NOW, YOU GOTTA MAKE
YOUR FINGERS CREEPY.

639
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,127
SO MAYBE--
SO THIS FINGER--

640
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:55,172
YOU'’VE GOT, LIKE, A COKE NAIL
ON THAT FINGER.

641
00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:57,740
THIS ONE'’S GOT, LIKE--LIKE,
A RACCOON EYEBALL FOR A RING.

642
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,438
MAYBE THIS--
YOU DON'’T NEED THIS FINGER.

643
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,440
YOU CUT THIS ONE OFF TOTALLY
'’CAUSE YOU LOST IT--

644
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,832
YOU LOST IT
IN THE HOBBIT BORE.

645
00:24:02,832 --> 00:24:03,877
I DON'’T CARE.

646
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:06,575
AND THEN
YOU GET A BRACELET

647
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:08,838
MADE OF, LIKE, WHORE GYPSY
KARDASHIAN HAIR.

648
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:11,145
YOU WRAP YOUR HAND IN IT.

649
00:24:11,145 --> 00:24:13,756
[laughter and applause]

650
00:24:13,756 --> 00:24:15,715
AND JUST AS YOU'’RE--
I PULL OUT MY GRABBING HAND.

651
00:24:15,715 --> 00:24:18,413
I HAVE IT SHEATHED.
IT'’S SHEATHED IN A SHEATH.

652
00:24:18,413 --> 00:24:20,676
AND, UH...

653
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:22,504
JUST AS YOU WERE LEAVING,
I'’D GO, "WAIT!"

654
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:24,027
YOU'’D BE,
LIKE, "WHAT?"

655
00:24:24,027 --> 00:24:27,944
AND I'’D SAY,
"THERE'’S ONE MORE THING."

656
00:24:27,944 --> 00:24:30,077
AND I'’D PULL OUT A HAND
OF MAGIC DUST,

657
00:24:30,077 --> 00:24:33,167
WHICH IS JUST SAND FROM THE
BEACH AISLE IN THE PHARMACY.

658
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:35,212
I'’D PULL--
I'’D PULL OUT A HAND OF DUST.

659
00:24:35,212 --> 00:24:38,520
AND I WOULD JUST GO...
[blows into microphone]

660
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,741
[laughter]

661
00:24:41,741 --> 00:24:43,090
"DO YOU HAVE
A CVS CARD?"

662
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,963
[laughter and applause]

663
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:57,278
I LOVE WALKING
AROUND PHARMACIES.

664
00:24:57,278 --> 00:24:59,236
I LOVE DOING THAT.

665
00:24:59,236 --> 00:25:00,629
I CAN'’T--I CAN'’T GO TO
A PHARMACY AND NOT SPEND MONEY.

666
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:02,109
ONE OF THE PRODUCTS
THAT CREEPS ME OUT--

667
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:03,893
THEY HAVE A PRODUCT
AT EVERY PHARMACY

668
00:25:03,893 --> 00:25:07,070
CALLED "K-Y INTENSE."

669
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,898
YOU SEEN THE COMMERCIALS
FOR THIS THING?

670
00:25:08,898 --> 00:25:10,552
THE COMMERCIAL FOR--
FIRST OF ALL,

671
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:13,163
THE COMMERCIAL FOR K-Y INTENSE
IS SUPER OFFENSIVE.

672
00:25:13,163 --> 00:25:14,251
AND WE WILL TALK
ABOUT THAT.

673
00:25:14,251 --> 00:25:15,601
IN THE C--
FIRST OF ALL,

674
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:17,385
IF YOU'’VE EVER USED
K-Y INTENSE,

675
00:25:17,385 --> 00:25:19,648
YOU KNOW THAT IT'’S INTENSE
BECAUSE IT BURNS.

676
00:25:19,648 --> 00:25:21,128
[laughter]

677
00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:22,608
I WILL VOLUNTEER THAT.

678
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:23,826
I ACCIDENTALLY USED IT
ONE TIME THINKING, LIKE,

679
00:25:23,826 --> 00:25:25,088
"THIS IS GONNA
BE MAGICAL."

680
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:26,612
AND IT BURNED.

681
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:28,527
AND I PROMISE YOU
GIRLS DON'’T WANT THAT.

682
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,615
IN MY LIFE,
I'’VE NEVER BEEN, LIKE,

683
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:31,399
"MAN, THAT SEX
WAS AWESOME.

684
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:33,357
"BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I WANTED
TO FEEL, LIKE, RIGHT AFTER?

685
00:25:33,357 --> 00:25:36,883
FIRE."
[laughter]

686
00:25:38,972 --> 00:25:40,147
OF COURSE,
THEY DON'’T BILL IT

687
00:25:40,147 --> 00:25:42,062
AS A BURNING SENSATION
ON TV.

688
00:25:42,062 --> 00:25:43,106
THEY CALL IT
"A TINGLING SENSATION."

689
00:25:43,106 --> 00:25:44,630
[laughter]

690
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,979
AND THEY TRY TO, LIKE, TALK
TO THE GIRLS.

691
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:47,415
THEY'’RE LIKE,
"LADIES, DO YOU WANT

692
00:25:47,415 --> 00:25:48,938
"MORE PLEASURE
OUT OF YOUR THREE MINUTES?

693
00:25:48,938 --> 00:25:50,200
DO YOU WANT THAT?
OKAY."

694
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,898
[laughter]

695
00:25:51,898 --> 00:25:53,595
"WELL, K-Y INTENSE
IS GREAT

696
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:55,510
"'’CAUSE IT'’S A TINGLING
SENSATION FOR HER

697
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,685
"AND HE GETS TO USE
HIS PENIS.

698
00:25:56,685 --> 00:26:00,559
SO EVERYBODY WINS."

699
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,386
BUT EVEN IF IT--
EVEN IF IT WAS

700
00:26:02,386 --> 00:26:04,780
A TINGLING SENSATION,
WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY

701
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,652
PRECONDITIONED TO NOT
WANT TINGLING.

702
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:08,392
WE DON'’T
LIKE TINGLING.

703
00:26:08,392 --> 00:26:10,960
WE KNOW THAT TINGLING, IT MEANS
A BAD THING IS HAPPENING.

704
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,962
"HEY, EVERYONE, GRANDMA SAYS
HER ARM IS TINGLING."

705
00:26:12,962 --> 00:26:14,790
"OH, SHE MUST BE HAVING
AN ORGASM."

706
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:18,620
[laughter and applause]

707
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,839
"YOU DON'’T HAVE TO RUSH HER
TO THE HOSPITAL.

708
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:21,231
"SHE'’S LAYING ON THE GROUND

709
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:22,624
"WITH HER EYES ROLLED BACK
IN HER HEAD.

710
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:25,496
SHE'’S CLEARLY
ENJOYING HERSELF."

711
00:26:25,496 --> 00:26:28,195
TINGLING.
IT'’S HORRIBLE.

712
00:26:28,195 --> 00:26:29,544
YOU EVER HIT YOUR FUNNY BONE
AND BEEN, LIKE...

713
00:26:29,544 --> 00:26:30,545
[mimics thudding]
"AHH."

714
00:26:30,545 --> 00:26:32,765
[laughter]

715
00:26:32,765 --> 00:26:36,159
THE COMMERCIAL IS AWFUL
BECAUSE IT'’S TWO BRITISH PEOPLE.

716
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,901
AND THEY'’RE SITTING THERE
HAVING BREAKFAST.

717
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:40,294
AND THEY'’RE DISCUSSING
ALL THE SEX

718
00:26:40,294 --> 00:26:42,470
THAT THEY HAD
THE NIGHT BEFORE...

719
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,776
[laughter]

720
00:26:43,776 --> 00:26:45,560
'’CAUSE THEY USED
THE K-Y INTENSE.

721
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,041
BUT BECAUSE THE BRITS ARE VERY
TACIT ABOUT SEXUAL THINGS,

722
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:49,695
THEY'’RE NOT COMING RIGHT OUT
AND DISCUSSING IT.

723
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:50,957
THEY'’RE SPEAKING
IN CODE.

724
00:26:50,957 --> 00:26:52,306
AND AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE SCREEN

725
00:26:52,306 --> 00:26:55,135
ARE THE SUBTITLES
IN AMERICAN

726
00:26:55,135 --> 00:26:56,876
SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND
WHAT THEY'’RE SAYING.

727
00:26:56,876 --> 00:26:58,268
SO THEY'’RE SITTING THERE,
AND THEY'’RE EATING.

728
00:26:58,268 --> 00:27:00,575
THEY'’RE HAVING
THEIR...PORRIDGE.

729
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:02,403
[laughter]

730
00:27:02,403 --> 00:27:04,710
THEY'’RE EATING
THEIR CURDS AND WHEY.

731
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,582
I DON'’T CARE WHAT THE BRITS EAT.
WE WON THE WAR, SO THERE.

732
00:27:07,582 --> 00:27:10,411
[cheering]
RIGHT?

733
00:27:10,411 --> 00:27:12,108
SO THEY'’RE SITTING THERE.
AND THEY'’RE EATING IT.

734
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:14,937
AND IT'’S JUST VERY QUIET.
AND THEY'’RE JUST...

735
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:21,378
[laughter]

736
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:23,685
[laughter]

737
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:26,949
[laughter]

738
00:27:26,949 --> 00:27:29,299
[laughter]
TEETH OUT TO HERE.

739
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:32,215
[laughter]

740
00:27:35,784 --> 00:27:39,875
AND THE GIRL
LOOKS AT THE GUY.

741
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:42,225
"WONDERFUL DESSERT
LAST NIGHT, SIRE."

742
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:45,185
SHE DIDN'’T SAY "SIRE."

743
00:27:45,185 --> 00:27:46,708
THEY DON'’T TALK
LIKE THAT ANYMORE.

744
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:50,494
SO SHE TALKS,
AND THERE'’S SUBTITLES.

745
00:27:50,494 --> 00:27:52,192
"WONDERFUL DESSERT
LAST NIGHT."

746
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,933
"HEY! WHAT'’D YOU PUT
ON MY PUSS, NIGGA?"

747
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:58,154
AND THEN THE GUY...

748
00:27:58,154 --> 00:27:59,547
RESPONDS IN KIND.

749
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:01,375
HE'’S LIKE,
"OH, YES, '’TWAS--

750
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:02,376
"'’TWAS A BIT
OF A NEW RECIPE.

751
00:28:02,376 --> 00:28:03,899
HOPED YOU LIKED IT."

752
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:05,901
"PUT SOME OF THAT K-Y SHIT
ON MY DICK, BITCH.

753
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:07,598
HOW YOU LIKE ME NOW?"
[mimics barking]

754
00:28:07,598 --> 00:28:11,254
[laughter and applause]

755
00:28:11,254 --> 00:28:13,126
AND THEN, THE GIRL IS,
LIKE, "OH, YES.

756
00:28:13,126 --> 00:28:15,258
'’TWAS QUITE INVIGORATING.
DIDN'’T EXPECT THAT ONE."

757
00:28:15,258 --> 00:28:16,956
"YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME
WITH THAT SHIT?

758
00:28:16,956 --> 00:28:18,435
"WHAT'’D YOU PUT?
ANTS ON YOUR DICK?

759
00:28:18,435 --> 00:28:20,307
IS THIS A JOKE?"

760
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:22,048
"YOU WANT
TO FUCKING DIE, MOTHERFUCKER?

761
00:28:22,048 --> 00:28:23,963
"YOU WANT TO END UP ON SNAP?
I'’LL FUCKING KILL YOU.

762
00:28:23,963 --> 00:28:25,355
THIS FUCKIN'’ HURT."

763
00:28:25,355 --> 00:28:28,881
THEN THE GUY, LIKE,
"OH, YES,

764
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:30,273
"TRIED A SPIN
ON AN OLD RECIPE.

765
00:28:30,273 --> 00:28:31,927
TRIED A DASH
OF NUTMEG."

766
00:28:31,927 --> 00:28:33,450
[laughter]

767
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,887
AND THERE WERE
NO SUBTITLES FOR THAT

768
00:28:34,887 --> 00:28:36,584
BECAUSE I THINK
THEY FUCKING DO USE NUTMEG.

769
00:28:36,584 --> 00:28:37,977
AND THAT'’S WHAT MAKES IT
BURN SO MUCH.

770
00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:41,371
[laughter and applause]

771
00:28:43,373 --> 00:28:46,072
I KNOW A LOT ABOUT SEX
AND DATING.

772
00:28:46,072 --> 00:28:47,290
I KNOW A LOT
ABOUT DATING

773
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,205
BECAUSE I WATCH
A LOT OF DATES.

774
00:28:49,205 --> 00:28:50,772
[laughter]

775
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:52,339
THAT SOUNDS CREEPY.
I HOST A DATING SHOW.

776
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:54,297
SO I'’VE LEARNED A LOT
ABOUT MEN AND WOMEN

777
00:28:54,297 --> 00:28:55,777
AND THEIR INTERACTIONS.

778
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:57,692
AND ONE IMPORTANT THING
THAT I'’VE LEARNED

779
00:28:57,692 --> 00:29:01,217
IS THAT WHEN YOU LIKE SOMEONE
AND YOU WANT TO IMPRESS THEM,

780
00:29:01,217 --> 00:29:02,392
WHAT DO YOU DO?

781
00:29:02,392 --> 00:29:04,699
YOU LIE.

782
00:29:04,699 --> 00:29:06,919
YOU HAVE TO,
BECAUSE IF PEOPLE KNEW

783
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:08,268
HOW WEIRD YOU WERE
IN YOUR OFF TIME,

784
00:29:08,268 --> 00:29:10,705
NO ONE WOULD HAVE YOU.

785
00:29:10,705 --> 00:29:12,663
A GUY SAYS TO YOU, "WHAT DO
YOU LIKE TO DO FOR FUN?"

786
00:29:12,663 --> 00:29:14,448
GIRLS, YOU CAN'’T
BE HONEST.

787
00:29:14,448 --> 00:29:16,842
YOU CAN'’T BE HONEST
ABOUT THAT SHIT.

788
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:18,365
YOU CAN'’T BE HONEST
ABOUT WHAT YOU WERE DOING

789
00:29:18,365 --> 00:29:20,367
10 MINUTES BEFORE YOU CAME
TO THE DOOR.

790
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:21,803
YOU HAVE TO LIE.

791
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:22,848
"WHAT DO YOU LIKE
TO DO FOR FUN?"

792
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:24,197
YOU CAN'’T TELL HIM.

793
00:29:24,197 --> 00:29:25,720
YOU CAN'’T BE, LIKE,
"I REALLY ENJOY

NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN,
A GUY ASKS A GIRL,

"WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO DO
FOR FUN?"

806
00:29:46,306 --> 00:29:48,569
THE GIRL'’S ANSWER
WILL BE, "HIKING."

YOU DON'’T LIKE HIKING.

YOU DON'’T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HIKING IS.

00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:22,298
TO THE AVERAGE GIRL,
HIKING IS

824
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:23,734
YOU WAKE UP
WHENEVER YOU WANT,

825
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:25,475
YOU PUT ON
LULULEMON YOGA PANTS

826
00:30:25,475 --> 00:30:27,521
'’CAUSE THEY MAKE YOUR BUTT
LOOK UNREASONABLY GOOD

827
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:30,872
AS THEY SHOULD
FOR 800 FUCKING DOLLARS.

828
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:32,395
AND YOU GO FOR A WALK
IN THE PARK

829
00:30:32,395 --> 00:30:33,483
WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND
AND COMPLAIN

830
00:30:33,483 --> 00:30:34,920
ABOUT HOW HUNG OVER
YOU ARE.

831
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:39,054
THAT'’S HIKING.
[laughter and applause]

832
00:30:39,054 --> 00:30:41,622
YEAH.
I DO IT TOO.

833
00:30:41,622 --> 00:30:43,232
PROMISE YOU THIS, GIRLS.

834
00:30:43,232 --> 00:30:45,104
IT'’S NOT A SPORT
IF YOU CAN DRINK A STARBUCKS

835
00:30:45,104 --> 00:30:47,497
AND HAVE A PITA
WHILE YOU'’RE DOING IT.

836
00:30:47,497 --> 00:30:48,542
"DO YOU WANT
A PIECE OF PITA?"

837
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:50,936
[groans]
"I'’M HIKING."

838
00:30:50,936 --> 00:30:52,328
BUT THERE'’S A METHOD
TO OUR MADNESS.

839
00:30:52,328 --> 00:30:54,461
THERE'’S A REASON WOMEN
SAY "HIKING."

840
00:30:54,461 --> 00:30:57,812
WE SAY HIKING BECAUSE WE THINK
GUYS LIKE HIKING.

841
00:30:57,812 --> 00:30:59,074
THAT'’S WHY
WE'’RE DOING IT.

842
00:30:59,074 --> 00:31:00,380
BE OUTSIDE
WHERE THE BUGS ARE?

843
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,338
NO!
WE THINK YOU LIKE THAT.

844
00:31:02,338 --> 00:31:04,732
WE'’RE TAUGHT TO BELIEVE
THAT MEN ARE OUTDOORSY,

845
00:31:04,732 --> 00:31:06,647
AND RUGGED,
AND THEY LIKE NATURE.

846
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:08,301
AS FAR
AS WE'’RE CONCERNED,

847
00:31:08,301 --> 00:31:11,782
YOU'’RE THE CLOSEST THING
WE KNOW TO A BEAR.

848
00:31:11,782 --> 00:31:13,959
[laughter]

849
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:15,351
SO WE SAY HIKING,
HOPING TO HAVE

850
00:31:15,351 --> 00:31:16,439
SOMETHING IN COMMON
WITH YOU.

851
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:18,006
WE HONESTLY
SAY "HIKING"

852
00:31:18,006 --> 00:31:19,921
HOPING THAT YOU'’LL BE,
LIKE, "YOU LIKE HIKING?

853
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:24,926
I LIKE HIKING.
MARRY ME."

854
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:26,493
IT'’S THE EASIEST THING
YOU CAN SAY THAT YOU DO.

855
00:31:26,493 --> 00:31:28,321
IT'’S ONE OF THE ONLY
OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES

856
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:30,627
THAT YOU CAN LIE
AND SAY THAT YOU DO IT

857
00:31:30,627 --> 00:31:32,586
HAVING NEVER
DONE IT BEFORE,

858
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:36,677
AND THEN DO IT AND PULL IT OFF
BECAUSE IT'’S WALKING.

859
00:31:36,677 --> 00:31:38,287
YOU CAN'’T PULL
THAT OFF,

860
00:31:38,287 --> 00:31:40,942
YOU SHOULDN'’T BE MATING
WITH ANYONE.

861
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:42,552
YOU CA--
MOST OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES

862
00:31:42,552 --> 00:31:44,380
REQUIRE A DECENT AMOUNT
OF SKILL.

863
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,905
FOR EXAMPLE, YOU CAN'’T SAY
YOU LIKE ROCK CLIMBING

864
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,994
IF YOU'’VE NEVER BEEN
ROCK CLIMBING.

865
00:31:48,994 --> 00:31:51,431
I MEAN, YOU CAN,
BUT I PROMISE YOU THIS.

866
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:55,217
YOU'’RE GONNA GO.
YOU'’RE GONNA SLIP.

867
00:31:55,217 --> 00:31:58,003
YOU'’RE GONNA GET YOUR HAND
CAUGHT IN A ROCK.

868
00:31:58,003 --> 00:32:01,571
127 HOURS LATER...
[laughter and applause]

869
00:32:06,794 --> 00:32:08,317
STUMP'’S NOT GETTING YOU
A SECOND DATE.

870
00:32:08,317 --> 00:32:10,276
I PROMISE YOU THAT.

871
00:32:10,276 --> 00:32:11,886
I DON'’T KNOW IF GIRLS
WANNA HEAR THIS,

872
00:32:11,886 --> 00:32:13,757
BUT THE TRUTH IS
90% OF THE ACTIVITIES

873
00:32:13,757 --> 00:32:15,368
THAT WOMEN ENGAGE IN

874
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:17,892
REVOLVE AROUND GETTING
A GUY'’S ATTENTION, OKAY?

875
00:32:17,892 --> 00:32:19,894
AND IT'’S JUST THE WAY
WE'’RE BUILT BIOLOGICALLY.

876
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:21,374
THIS IS JUST
SOMETHING WE DO.

877
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:22,897
WE LOVE TO GET
YOUR ATTENTION.

878
00:32:22,897 --> 00:32:24,507
IT'’S PART OF THE SPORT OF IT,
ALL RIGHT?

879
00:32:24,507 --> 00:32:26,205
YOU THINK
I GO TO A SPORTS BAR

880
00:32:26,205 --> 00:32:27,684
BECAUSE I LIKE WARM BEER
AND STICKY BARSTOOLS?

881
00:32:27,684 --> 00:32:29,295
NO. I GO '’CAUSE THERE'’S
GUYS THERE.

882
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:30,687
YOU THINK I DO A PUB CRAWL
EVERY YEAR

883
00:32:30,687 --> 00:32:32,124
'’CAUSE I LIKE IT
WHEN MY LIVER HURTS?

884
00:32:32,124 --> 00:32:33,821
NO! I GO '’CAUSE THERE'’S
GUYS THERE.

885
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:34,909
WE DON'’T WEAR HEELS
FOR OUR CIRCULATION.

886
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:36,606
WE DO IT
TO PROP UP OUR BUTT

887
00:32:36,606 --> 00:32:37,999
SO YOU'’LL LOOK AT ME
AND WANT TO MATE WITH ME.

888
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:39,479
THAT'’S WHY WE DO IT.

889
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:41,133
THIS ISN'’T A FUCKING GAME,
ALL RIGHT?

890
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:42,786
THIS ISN'’T A PUSH-UP BRA.
IT'’S BODY ARMOR.

891
00:32:42,786 --> 00:32:44,179
AND THIS AIN'’T
MAKEUP, SWEETHEART.

892
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:46,312
IT'’S WAR PAINT.
LET'’S MAKE A BABY.

893
00:32:46,312 --> 00:32:49,968
[cheers and applause]

894
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:58,367
GIRLS KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT THEY'’RE DOING.

895
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:00,195
WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU LIKE,
WHAT YOU DON'’T LIKE.

896
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:01,892
WE DO OUR RESEARCH
WHEN WE LIKE A GUY.

897
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:04,199
AND BY RESEARCH,
I MEAN WE FACEBOOK STALK YOU.

898
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:06,071
WE DO IT.

899
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:07,376
I KNOW
YOUR FAVORITE FOODS.

900
00:33:07,376 --> 00:33:08,856
I KNOW
WHERE YOU WENT ON VACATION.

901
00:33:08,856 --> 00:33:10,858
I KNOW THAT YOUR FAVORITE TEAM
IS THE COWBOYS.

902
00:33:10,858 --> 00:33:12,642
I KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT.
I'’M TOTALLY INTO YOU.

903
00:33:12,642 --> 00:33:14,079
THAT'’S RIGHT.

904
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:16,037
THEY SAY MEN ARE HUNTERS
AND WOMEN ARE GATHERERS.

905
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:18,039
WELL, KIND OF.
WOMEN ARE GATHERERS.

906
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:19,693
WE LIKE TO GATHER INFORMATION
ABOUT YOU.

907
00:33:19,693 --> 00:33:22,478
AND THEN WE HUNT YOU.

908
00:33:22,478 --> 00:33:24,480
YOU THINK WHEN I BRING YOU HOME
TO MEET MOM ON CHRISTMAS

909
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,308
IT'’S '’CAUSE I WANT HER
TO MEET YOU?

910
00:33:26,308 --> 00:33:29,007
NO, IT'’S SO I CAN BE, LIKE,
"MOM, LOOK WHAT I CAUGHT."

911
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,879
[laughter and applause]

912
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:33,707
WE HAVE TO, BECAUSE GUYS
ARE KIND OF PASSIVE

913
00:33:33,707 --> 00:33:35,317
WHEN IT COMES
TO MEETING WOMEN.

914
00:33:35,317 --> 00:33:37,189
SURE, THEY GO OUT.
BUT GIRLS MAKE A SPORT OF IT.

915
00:33:37,189 --> 00:33:38,581
MY GUY FRIENDS
DON'’T CARE.

916
00:33:38,581 --> 00:33:39,974
IF THEY HAD THEIR WAY,
THEY'’D SPEND

917
00:33:39,974 --> 00:33:41,715
EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT
WITH EACH OTHER--

918
00:33:41,715 --> 00:33:43,934
WHICH IS WEIRD--
WATCHING "1000 WAYS TO DIE,"

919
00:33:43,934 --> 00:33:45,675
EATING SANDWICHES,
RAGGING ON THEIR ONE FRIEND

920
00:33:45,675 --> 00:33:47,286
THAT HAS A HUGE NUT SACK
FOR NO REASON.

921
00:33:47,286 --> 00:33:49,766
LIKE, THAT'’S WHAT
THEY WOULD DO.

922
00:33:49,766 --> 00:33:52,334
GOING OUT'’S
VERY IMPORTANT.

923
00:33:52,334 --> 00:33:54,249
YOU GOT A REAL JOB, YOUR WEEKEND
IS VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU,

924
00:33:54,249 --> 00:33:56,164
BECAUSE A WEEKEND REPRESENTS
48 HOURS

925
00:33:56,164 --> 00:33:58,601
THAT YOU HAVE
TO FUCK UP THE LIFE

926
00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:00,908
THAT YOU WORKED SO HARD FOR
ALL WEEK.

927
00:34:00,908 --> 00:34:05,782
[laughter and applause]

928
00:34:05,782 --> 00:34:07,088
THAT'’S WHAT
YOUR WEEKEND IS.

929
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:08,655
IF YOU'’RE
A REAL PROFESSIONAL,

930
00:34:08,655 --> 00:34:12,180
YOUR WEEKEND STARTS THURSDAY
AT, LIKE, 5:00 P.M.

931
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,747
RIGHT?
YOU GO TO HAPPY HOUR.

932
00:34:13,747 --> 00:34:14,922
HAPPY HOUR TRICKLES
INTO, LIKE, NIGHTTIME.

933
00:34:14,922 --> 00:34:16,706
YOU'’RE DRINKING
A LITTLE BIT

934
00:34:16,706 --> 00:34:18,882
'’CAUSE YOU CAN GO TO WORK
A LITTLE HUNG OVER, RIGHT?

935
00:34:18,882 --> 00:34:20,667
NO ONE'’S DOING REAL WORK
ON FRIDAY.

936
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:22,843
NOBODY'’S WORKING
ON A FRIDAY.

937
00:34:22,843 --> 00:34:24,105
NOBODY'’S WORKING ON A FRIDAY
'’CAUSE IT'’S WHAT?

938
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:25,628
SHABBAT. NO.

939
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:28,544
BECAUSE IT'’S FRIDAY
AND NOBODY CARES.

940
00:34:28,544 --> 00:34:30,677
YOU EVER BEEN AT WORK, YOUR BOSS
IS NEVER GONNA BE, LIKE,

941
00:34:30,677 --> 00:34:32,722
"LET'’S GET IN THOSE REPORTS
AND START BRAINSTORMING."

942
00:34:32,722 --> 00:34:34,028
YOU'’RE, LIKE,
"OKAY, I'’LL BE THERE."

943
00:34:34,028 --> 00:34:37,075
[chuckles]

944
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,511
"OH, YOU WERE SERIOUS?
OKAY, LITTLE HAND JOB.

945
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:39,599
I'’LL BE AT MY DESK.
THAT'’S FINE."

946
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,950
[laughter]

947
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,560
GIRLS TAKE GOING OUT
VERY SERIOUSLY

948
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,301
'’CAUSE THAT'’S
OUR HUNTING GROUNDS.

949
00:34:46,301 --> 00:34:48,216
"GOING OUT.
LET'’S DO IT."

950
00:34:48,216 --> 00:34:50,349
[laughter]

951
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:52,742
"DO YOU WANT TO DO,
LIKE, A GIRLS'’ NIGHT?

952
00:34:52,742 --> 00:34:54,962
DO YOU WANNA
DO THAT?"

953
00:34:54,962 --> 00:34:56,529
EVERY WEEKEND, I GET CALLS
FROM MY GIRLFRIENDS.

954
00:34:56,529 --> 00:34:58,400
"DO YOU WANT TO DO,
LIKE, JUST GIRLS?

955
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,489
"DO YOU WANT TO DO,
LIKE, A FUN GIRLS'’ NIGHT?

956
00:35:00,489 --> 00:35:02,012
ILIZA, I'’M TALKING TO YOU.
ILIZA."

957
00:35:02,012 --> 00:35:03,101
[mimics baaing]
"DO YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

958
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,319
[laughter]

959
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:05,712
[mimics baaing]
"DO YOU WANNA DO,

960
00:35:05,712 --> 00:35:07,061
"LIKE, A GIRLS'’--
WE'’LL JUST DO--

961
00:35:07,061 --> 00:35:08,410
"OH, WE'’LL ALL WEAR,
LIKE, FUN SHOES.

962
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:10,108
"AND WE'’LL ALL GET,
LIKE, APIS.

963
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,065
AND THEN, WE'’LL DO,
LIKE, A FUN GIRLS'’ NIGHT."

964
00:35:11,065 --> 00:35:12,240
"DO YOU WANNA
DO THAT?

965
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,502
"I WANNA DO
A GIRLS'’ NIGHT.

966
00:35:13,502 --> 00:35:14,982
I MADE AN EVITE
FOR THE FOUR OF US."

967
00:35:14,982 --> 00:35:17,767
[laughter]

968
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:19,204
"YOU DIDN'’T ANSWER."

969
00:35:19,204 --> 00:35:20,553
"'’CAUSE I'’M STANDING
RIGHT HERE."

970
00:35:20,553 --> 00:35:23,164
"YOU'’RE SUCH A BITCH."

971
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:24,209
"LET'’S DO A GIRLS'’ NIGHT.
LET'’S DO JUST GIRLS.

972
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:25,732
"NO BOYS.

973
00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:28,169
LET'’S JUST ALL WEAR WEDGES
AND NO BOYS."

974
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:30,476
[laughter]

975
00:35:30,476 --> 00:35:32,521
"LET'’S NOT DO BOYS, JUST GIRLS.
JUST THE GIRLS."

976
00:35:32,521 --> 00:35:34,567
I'’M LIKE, "WHY?

977
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:37,352
WE HATE EACH OTHER."

978
00:35:37,352 --> 00:35:38,919
GIRLS HATE
EACH OTHER.

979
00:35:38,919 --> 00:35:41,226
ESP--SHE HATES YOU,
ESPECIALLY DURING THE DAY.

980
00:35:41,226 --> 00:35:43,184
[laughter]

981
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:45,621
BUT WHEN THE MOON COMES UP
AND THERE'’S WHITE WINE INVOLVED,

982
00:35:45,621 --> 00:35:49,538
"OH, MY GOD.
STACY, YOU LOOK AMAZING.

983
00:35:49,538 --> 00:35:52,193
I FUCKING LOVE YOU."

984
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:53,412
AND YOU NOTICE
THE DRUNKER YOU GET,

985
00:35:53,412 --> 00:35:55,849
THE MORE SPANISH

00:41:20,216 --> 00:41:21,653
AND THEN YOU BRING
YOUR ONE FRIEND

1144
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:22,915
THAT HAS NO ISSUE
WITH YOU DITCHING HER.

1145
00:41:22,915 --> 00:41:24,177
YOU GO TO THE BAR,
AND YOU POST UP,

1146
00:41:24,177 --> 00:41:25,134
AND YOU WAIT
UNTIL HE GETS THERE.

1147
00:41:25,134 --> 00:41:26,745
HE SHOWS UP.

1148
00:41:26,745 --> 00:41:28,311
YOU'’RE LIKE,
"I GUESS EVERYBODY PASSED OUT.

[groans]

1150
00:41:29,704 --> 00:41:31,271

YOU'’RE LIKE,
"YEAH, A SECOND DATE.

1156
00:41:38,191 --> 00:41:39,148
"IT ONLY TOOK ME
SIX FUCKING MONTHS.

1157
00:41:39,148 --> 00:41:41,107
YEAH."

1158
00:41:41,107 --> 00:41:42,935
SO NOW, YOU'’RE EXCITED
'’CAUSE YOU HAVE A SECOND DATE.

1159
00:41:42,935 --> 00:41:44,371
AND GIRLS LOVE GETTING READY
FOR DATES.

1160
00:41:44,371 --> 00:41:45,851
EVEN THOUGH IT MAKES US
A LITTLE NAUSEOUS

1161
00:41:45,851 --> 00:41:46,852
AND ALL WE WANNA DO
IS STAY HOME AND EAT,

1162
00:41:46,852 --> 00:41:48,593
WE LOVE SECOND DATES

1163
00:41:48,593 --> 00:41:49,550
'’CAUSE YOU GOT TO GET READY

00:41:50,943 --> 00:41:52,422
YOU DO YOUR HAIR,

00:41:52,422 --> 00:41:55,338
YOU SHAVE YOUR BIG TOE.

1167
00:41:58,603 --> 00:42:00,169
YOU COME
TO PLAY, RIGHT?

1168
00:42:00,169 --> 00:42:01,649
GOTTA MAKE SURE
YOUR UNDERWEAR'’S CUTE.

1169
00:42:01,649 --> 00:42:03,259
DON'’T WANNA GO
TO VICTORIA'’S SECRET

1170
00:42:03,259 --> 00:42:05,000
'’CAUSE THAT'’S A BIT TOO MUCH
OF A COMMITMENT.

1171
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,873
SO WHERE DO YOU GO FOR A CHEAP
BRA THAT'’S REALLY CUTE?

1172
00:42:07,873 --> 00:42:11,398
TARGET.
[laughter and applause]

1173
00:42:11,398 --> 00:42:12,573
THEY DON'’T FIT,
AND YOU'’RE LIKE, "FUCK IT.

1174
00:42:12,573 --> 00:42:14,096
"FOR $12.50,

AND BARBED WIRE.

1176
00:42:15,881 --> 00:42:18,013
THAT'’S FINE."

1177
00:42:18,013 --> 00:42:19,406
"IT DOESN'’T FIT
THIS BOOB,

1178
00:42:19,406 --> 00:42:20,755
"AND IT MAKES THIS NIPPLE
FALL ASLEEP.

1179
00:42:20,755 --> 00:42:23,889
BUT FOR 12 BUCKS,
I'’M GOOD."

1180
00:42:23,889 --> 00:42:25,978
YOU GET ALL EXCITED.
YOU PUT ON MAKEUP.

1181
00:42:25,978 --> 00:42:27,849
YOU PUT ON THE MAKEUP THAT
YOU'’RE OKAY WITH SLEEPING IN.

1182
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:29,764
ALL GIRLS HAVE
TO MAKE THIS DECISION

1183
00:42:29,764 --> 00:42:31,505
'’CAUSE YOU KNOW YOU'’RE NOT
GONNA BE WASHING YOUR FACE

1184
00:42:31,505 --> 00:42:33,246
BECAUSE GIRLS ARE SO FUCKED UP
THAT WE THINK,

1185
00:42:33,246 --> 00:42:35,161
"I'’D RATHER FALL ASLEEP,
GET NIGHT ZITS,

1186
00:42:35,161 --> 00:42:38,512
"AND WAKE UP LOOKING
LIKE A MELTED CLOWN

1187
00:42:38,512 --> 00:42:41,428
THAN EVER WASH MY FACE AND SHOW
HIM THAT I'’M A HUMAN BEING."

1188
00:42:41,428 --> 00:42:43,125
SO YOU GO THERE.
YOU'’RE ALL EXCITED.

1189
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:44,736
YOU GET TO HIS HOUSE.
YOU GUYS START DRINKING.

1190
00:42:44,736 --> 00:42:47,173
YOU GET SO FUCKING WASTED
IN THE FIRST TWO HOURS

1191
00:42:47,173 --> 00:42:48,522
THAT YOU HAVE SEX
FOR THREE MINUTES

1192
00:42:48,522 --> 00:42:49,697
BEFORE HE GOES
COMPLETELY SOFT.

1193
00:42:49,697 --> 00:42:51,177
AND THE NEXT THING
YOU KNOW,

1194
00:42:51,177 --> 00:42:52,961
YOU WAKE UP IN YOUR UNDERWEAR
ON HIS COUCH.

1195
00:42:52,961 --> 00:42:53,919
YOU LOOK OVER,
HE'’S EATING NOODLES,

1196
00:42:53,919 --> 00:42:55,137
WATCHING "HARRY POTTER."

1197
00:42:55,137 --> 00:42:57,444
IS THIS RELATABLE
TO ANYONE ELSE?

1198
00:42:57,444 --> 00:43:00,621
[cheering]

1199
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:02,667
POPULAR MISCONCEPTION
ABOUT GIRLS

1200
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:04,886
IS THAT WE GET DRUNK
AND WE WANNA HAVE SEX.

1201
00:43:04,886 --> 00:43:06,496
HERE'’S THE TRUTH.

1202
00:43:06,496 --> 00:43:08,629
WE DO.
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

1203
00:43:08,629 --> 00:43:11,197
NO.

1204
00:43:11,197 --> 00:43:14,592
WE DO FOR, LIKE, THE FIRST HOUR
OF BEING DRUNK, OKAY?

1205
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,246
LET'’S TALK ABOUT THE FIRST HOUR
OF BEING DRUNK

1206
00:43:17,246 --> 00:43:21,163
MOSTLY BECAUSE MANY OF YOU
ARE IN THAT HOUR RIGHT NOW.

1207
00:43:21,163 --> 00:43:23,992
I CALL IT
"THE WITCHING HOUR."

1208
00:43:23,992 --> 00:43:25,428
THE FIRST HOUR
OF BEING DRUNK

1209
00:43:25,428 --> 00:43:27,692
IS THE BEST HOUR
OF THE NIGHT

1210
00:43:27,692 --> 00:43:30,085
BECAUSE YOUR BUZZ
IS FRESH.

1211
00:43:30,085 --> 00:43:32,653
YOU'’RE HAPPY.
YOU DON'’T FEEL FAT.

1212
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:36,526
YOU HAVEN'’T CRIED YET.

1213
00:43:36,526 --> 00:43:37,702
YOU'’RE STILL SOMEWHAT
OF THE SELF YOU WERE

1214
00:43:37,702 --> 00:43:39,268
WHEN YOU WERE SOBER.

1215
00:43:39,268 --> 00:43:41,793
YOU STILL COULD OSTENSIBLY
OPERATE HEAVY MACHINERY

1216
00:43:41,793 --> 00:43:44,534
IF AN EMERGENCY
WERE TO ARISE, OKAY?

1217
00:43:44,534 --> 00:43:46,624
YOU'’RE IN THAT BUZZ.
YOU'’RE FEELING AWESOME.

1218
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,408
YOUR SYNAPSES HAVEN'’T BEEN
SOAKED IN ALCOHOL.

1219
00:43:48,408 --> 00:43:50,323
SO YOU'’RE STILL ALERT.
YOU'’RE FEELING AWESOME.

1220
00:43:50,323 --> 00:43:52,238

[mimics baaing]

1225
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,031
YOU AND YOUR AWFUL FRIENDS
LINE UP AT THE BAR.

00:44:03,031 --> 00:44:04,685
LIKE, "LET'’S DO SHOTS."

1227
00:44:04,685 --> 00:44:06,687
YOU'’RE DOING SHOTS
YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS DOING.

"YOU DON'’T
WANNA DO THAT?"

SO YOU'’RE FEELING GOOD
AND YOU'’RE DANCING.

1274
00:45:35,776 --> 00:45:37,082
YOU'’RE LIKE,
"I FEEL SO THIN.

YOU'’RE LIKE, "OH, MY GOD.
I FEEL SO GOOD RIGHT NOW.

I WISH I COULD FEEL THIS BUZZ
AND THIS HAPPY ALL THE TIME."

1281
00:45:51,226 --> 00:45:53,794
AND THAT'’S
WHEN YOU REALIZE

1282
00:45:53,794 --> 00:45:57,929
THAT'’S HOW
AN ALCOHOLIC THINKS.

1283
00:45:57,929 --> 00:45:59,626
BUT YOU'’RE, LIKE, "SCREW IT.
I'’M GONNA GIVE IT A SHOT.

1284
00:45:59,626 --> 00:46:02,890
I'’M GONNA SEE JUST HOW FAR
I CAN PUSH BEING DRUNK."

1285
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:04,457
SO YOU DECIDE
TO DO SHOTS.

1286
00:46:04,457 --> 00:46:06,720
AND YOU DECIDE,
"THESE SHOTS AREN'’T GONNA GET ME

00:46:16,382 --> 00:46:18,123
AND THIS IS
YOUR BRILLIANT IDEA.

1291
00:46:18,123 --> 00:46:21,126
NO ONE IN THE THOUSANDS OF YEARS
OF PEOPLE IMBIBING ALCOHOL

HAS EVER THOUGHT
OF THIS.

THIS IS
YOUR NIGHT, EINSTEIN.

1294

"I'’M JUST HAVING..."

1300
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:37,620
"I'’M JUST DRINKING WATER,
BUT THANK YOU."

1301
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,709
SHOT AND WATER,
BUT WHAT YOU DON'’T REALIZE

1302
00:46:39,709 --> 00:46:41,146
IS THAT FIVE SHOTS
IN AN HOUR

1303
00:46:41,146 --> 00:46:45,063
IS STILL FIVE FUCKING SHOTS
IN AN HOUR.

1304
00:46:45,063 --> 00:46:47,761
YOU WENT AND DRANK ALL
THAT WATER LIKE A CRAZY CAMEL.

1305
00:46:47,761 --> 00:46:49,110
YEAH, GOOD JOB.
NOW, YOU'’RE BLOATED.

1306
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:51,417
AND YOU HAVE TO PEE.
WAY TO BE.

1307
00:46:51,417 --> 00:46:52,766
'’CAUSE WHEN A GIRL'’S
GOTTA PEE,

1308
00:46:52,766 --> 00:46:54,768
EVERYTHING HAS TO COME
TO A HALT.

1309
00:46:54,768 --> 00:46:56,030
EVERY GIRL'’S
GOTTA GO WITH HER.

1310
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:58,380
"I HAVE TO PEE.
DO YOU HAVE TO PEE?"

1311
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,035
[mimics baaing]

1312
00:47:01,035 --> 00:47:05,300
"I CAN'’T GO ALONE.
NO.

1313
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,911
"WILL YOU STOP WHAT YOU'’RE DOING
AND COME WITH ME?

1314
00:47:06,911 --> 00:47:08,608
"I HAVE TO PEE.
DO YOU HAVE TO PEE?

1315
00:47:08,608 --> 00:47:10,784
"I HAVE TO PEE.
I HAVE TO GO PEE."

1316
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:18,748
CAN'’T GO
IN THE BATHROOM ALONE.

1317
00:47:18,748 --> 00:47:21,534
YOU MIGHT NOT COME BACK.

1318
00:47:21,534 --> 00:47:23,101
'’CAUSE NO GIRL'’S
EVER BEEN

1319
00:47:23,101 --> 00:47:25,799
TO THE BATHROOM ALONE
AND SURVIVED.

1320
00:47:25,799 --> 00:47:27,888
IT'’S TRUE.

1321
00:47:27,888 --> 00:47:29,803
THE LAST WOMAN
THAT ATTEMPTED IT,

1322
00:47:29,803 --> 00:47:32,545
IT WAS 1937...

1323
00:47:32,545 --> 00:47:35,765
AND HER NAME
WAS AMELIA EARHART.

1324
00:47:35,765 --> 00:47:38,681
[laughter and applause]

1325
00:47:42,642 --> 00:47:44,165
IT'’S A BIG EVENT.

1326
00:47:44,165 --> 00:47:46,080
"I HAVE TO PEE.
COME ON. LET'’S GO.

1327
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,299
"EVERY GIRL, LET'’S GO,
YOU GIRLS.

1328
00:47:47,299 --> 00:47:48,909
"COME ON.
I HAVE TO PEE, COME ON.

1329
00:47:48,909 --> 00:47:50,258
"TAKE MY HAND.
LET'’S MAKE A CHAIN OF WHORES.

1330
00:47:50,258 --> 00:47:51,651
EVERYONE HOLDS HANDS."

1331
00:47:51,651 --> 00:47:53,261
AS THEY WALK
INTO THE BATHROOM.

1332
00:47:53,261 --> 00:47:55,916
FOR ME, WHEN I'’M WALKING
THROUGH A CROWDED BAR,

1333
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:58,440
THE AMOUNT OF AGGRESSION
I WILL DISPLAY

1334
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,313
TOWARD THE OTHER BAR PATRONS
IS IN DIRECT CORRELATION

1335
00:48:01,313 --> 00:48:03,619
WITH HOW MANY BOYS
I'’VE GOTTEN TO FLIRT WITH.

1336
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:06,448
MEANING IF I HAVEN'’T GOTTEN
TO TALK TO ANY CUTE GUYS,

1337
00:48:06,448 --> 00:48:08,233
MAMA'’S GONNA BE
A LITTLE AGGRESSIVE

1338
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:10,452
IN HER WALK
TO THE BATHROOM, OKAY?

1339
00:48:10,452 --> 00:48:12,280
GUYS, WHEN THEY GET DRUNK,
SOMETIMES PUNCH WALLS.

1340
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,760
I LIKE TO MULE KICK OTHER GIRLS
IN THE SHIN.

1341
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,414
IT'’S TOTALLY FINE.

1342
00:48:15,414 --> 00:48:16,632
EVERY GIRL'’S DONE THIS.
AND YOU KNOW WHY WE DO IT?

1343
00:48:16,632 --> 00:48:18,330
'’CAUSE WE CAN GET AWAY
WITH IT.

1344
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:19,940
YOU CAN KNOCK INTO A GIRL
AND THEN BE, LIKE, "OOPS.

1345
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,463
I DIDN'’T MEAN THAT."

1346

[laughter]

1347
00:48:23,683 --> 00:48:25,380
OUR SMILE
IS OUR JEDI MIND TRICK.

1348
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:28,209
JUST, "THESE ARE NOT THE DROIDS
YOU'’RE LOOKING FOR."

1349
00:48:28,209 --> 00:48:30,777
YOU EVER DO THAT?

1350
00:48:30,777 --> 00:48:32,431
YOU EVER JUST CHECK A GIRL
INTO THE BOARDS '’CAUSE YOU CAN?

1351
00:48:32,431 --> 00:48:33,911
YOU EVER JUST BEEN WALKING,
AND JUST BEEN, LIKE--

1352
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,738
[mimics thudding]
"I LOVE YOUR SHOES. OOPS."

1353
00:48:35,738 --> 00:48:38,872
[laughter]

1354
00:48:38,872 --> 00:48:40,265
TAKES YOU FOREVER,
BUT YOU FINALLY GET THROUGH

1355
00:48:40,265 --> 00:48:41,353
THAT JUNGLE OF PEOPLE.

1356
00:48:41,353 --> 00:48:42,658
YOU GET TO THE BATHROOM.

1357
00:48:42,658 --> 00:48:44,356
FOR THOSE OF YOU
THAT HAVEN'’T BEEN

1358
00:48:44,356 --> 00:48:46,097
IN A WOMEN'’S RESTROOM
LATE NIGHT,

1359
00:48:46,097 --> 00:48:48,403
A WOMEN'’S RESTROOM
LATE NIGHT

1360
00:48:48,403 --> 00:48:50,928
LOOKS LIKE A SCENE OUT OF
"APOCALYPSE NOW."

1361
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,581
[laughter]

1362
00:48:52,581 --> 00:48:54,975
THERE'’S GUNFIRE,
EXPLOSIONS,

1363
00:48:54,975 --> 00:48:57,064
BLOOD EVERYWHERE,
CHILDREN,

1364
00:48:57,064 --> 00:48:59,762
A LOT OF VIETNAMESE MEN,
WHICH I NEVER QUITE UNDERSTOOD,

1365
00:48:59,762 --> 00:49:00,763
LIKE, WHY THEY'’D BE THERE.

1366
00:49:00,763 --> 00:49:02,156
YOU'’RE WITH YOUR BUDDIES

1367
00:49:02,156 --> 00:49:03,853
JUST TRYING
TO GET THROUGH EVERYTHING.

1368
00:49:03,853 --> 00:49:05,681
YOU GO PEE.
YOU GET TO THE SINK.

1369
00:49:05,681 --> 00:49:08,815
AND THEN, YOUR NIGHT COMES
TO A SCREECHING HALT

1370
00:49:08,815 --> 00:49:12,036
'’CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN, LIKE, FOUR HOURS,

1371
00:49:12,036 --> 00:49:13,907
YOU GET A LOOK AT YOURSELF
IN THE MIRROR.

1372
00:49:13,907 --> 00:49:16,823
[laughter and applause]

1373
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:23,525
AND YOU SEE THE SWAMP WITCH
THAT YOU'’VE BECOME.

1374
00:49:23,525 --> 00:49:27,138
[laughter]

1375
00:49:27,138 --> 00:49:29,096
TEN MINUTES AGO, YOU THOUGHT
YOU LOOKED LIKE HEIDI KLUM.

1376
00:49:29,096 --> 00:49:31,142
IT TURNS OUT
YOU LOOK LIKE SEAL.

1377
00:49:31,142 --> 00:49:34,014
[laughter and applause]

1378
00:49:39,237 --> 00:49:41,369
IT HITS YOU LIKE A TON OF BRICKS
OUT OF NOWHERE.

1379
00:49:41,369 --> 00:49:42,849
AND YOU DON'’T KNOW
IT'’S COMING.

1380
00:49:42,849 --> 00:49:44,242
YOU'’RE SITTING THERE
TALKING TO YOUR FRIENDS.

1381
00:49:44,242 --> 00:49:45,983
YOU'’RE LIKE,
"THIS IS AWESOME.

1382
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:50,291
"I'’M GONNA BE YOUNG FOREVER.
THIS IS--[screams]"

1383
00:49:50,291 --> 00:49:53,077
"NO! WHAT?
WHAT IS THIS?

1384
00:49:53,077 --> 00:49:56,689
I WAS ONCE
A GREAT BEAUTY."

1385
00:49:56,689 --> 00:49:59,561
"NO.

1386
00:49:59,561 --> 00:50:02,086
WHAT IS THIS?"
[babbles indistinctly]

1387
00:50:02,086 --> 00:50:03,478
YOU GO TO TOUCH IT.
IT DISAPPEARS.

1388
00:50:03,478 --> 00:50:04,871
YOU'’RE, LIKE--
[babbles indistinctly]

1389
00:50:04,871 --> 00:50:06,568
"IS IT A HOLOGRAM?
WHAT IS THAT?

1390
00:50:06,568 --> 00:50:07,787
I LOOK WEIRD."

1391
00:50:07,787 --> 00:50:09,571
ONE EYEBALL
HAS MIGRATED HERE.

1392
00:50:09,571 --> 00:50:11,138
[laughter]

1393
00:50:11,138 --> 00:50:13,575
YOU LOOK DOWN.
YOU'’RE JUST LEAKING VODKA.

1394
00:50:13,575 --> 00:50:15,969
[laughter]

1395
00:50:15,969 --> 00:50:18,145
NOW, YOU DON'’T WANNA HOOK UP
WITH ANYONE.

1396
00:50:18,145 --> 00:50:23,150
NOW, ALL YOU WANNA DO
IS EAT.

1397
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,847
I'’M A RED-BLOODED
AMERICAN GIRL.

1398
00:50:24,847 --> 00:50:26,806
ABSOLUTELY, WHEN I GET DRUNK,
I WOULD RATHER EAT

1399
00:50:26,806 --> 00:50:28,068
THAN HOOK UP WITH YOU.

1400
00:50:28,068 --> 00:50:30,723
I'’M SORRY.
I DON'’T KNOW.

1401
00:50:30,723 --> 00:50:32,812
GIVE YOU A HAND JOB
OR GO GET FRIES?

1402
00:50:32,812 --> 00:50:36,729
[laughter and applause]

1403
00:50:43,997 --> 00:50:45,825
BOTH ARE SALTY.
ONE WILL GIVE ME CARPAL TUNNEL.

1404
00:50:45,825 --> 00:50:48,871
I'’LL GO WITH THE FRIES.
EVERY TIME.

1405
00:50:48,871 --> 00:50:51,396
[applause]

1406
00:50:51,396 --> 00:50:52,962
A POPULAR MISCONCEPTION
ABOUT GIRLS

1407
00:50:52,962 --> 00:50:54,094
IS THAT WE DON'’T
LIKE TO EAT.

1408
00:50:54,094 --> 00:50:57,228
GIRLS LOVE TO EAT.
YEAH.

1409
00:50:57,228 --> 00:50:58,838
WE JUST DON'’T LIKE TO EAT
IN FRONT OF A GUY THAT WE LIKE.

1410
00:50:58,838 --> 00:51:00,274
THAT'’S THE DIFFERENCE.

1411
00:51:00,274 --> 00:51:01,841
WHEN YOU FIRST MEET A GUY
THAT YOU LIKE,

1412
00:51:01,841 --> 00:51:03,538
YOU CAN'’T EAT THE WAY
YOU WANT TO ON A DATE.

1413
00:51:03,538 --> 00:51:05,279
YOU CAN'’T.

1414
00:51:05,279 --> 00:51:07,368
YOU CAN'’T HAVE THAT FOURTH PLATE
OF RIBS ON A DATE...

1415
00:51:07,368 --> 00:51:10,197
[laughter]

1416
00:51:10,197 --> 00:51:14,593
I FOUND OUT.

1417
00:51:14,593 --> 00:51:15,724
GOING ON A DATE,
SOCIETY DICTATES

1418
00:51:15,724 --> 00:51:16,899
THAT GUYS CAN DO
WHAT THEY WANT

1419
00:51:16,899 --> 00:51:18,205
AND WOMEN HAVE
TO BE DAINTY.

1420
00:51:18,205 --> 00:51:20,468
SO HE'’S GONNA GET FRIES,
A BURGER,

1421
00:51:20,468 --> 00:51:23,471
HALF A GAZELLE,
WHATEVER HE WANTS TO EAT.

1422
00:51:23,471 --> 00:51:25,386
GIRLS, YOU GET THE MENU,
WHAT ARE YOU ORDERING?

1423
00:51:25,386 --> 00:51:27,736
all: SALAD.
- SALAD.

1424
00:51:27,736 --> 00:51:34,395
LIKE HOT LITTLE ROBOTS.
SALAD.

1425
00:51:34,395 --> 00:51:36,397
AND IT'’S
AN EXCRUCIATING EXPERIENCE

1426
00:51:36,397 --> 00:51:37,877
'’CAUSE YOU'’RE TRYING TO JUST
LOOK PRETTY THE WHOLE TIME.

1427
00:51:37,877 --> 00:51:39,139
HE'’S SITTING THERE
ENJOYING HIS BURGER.

1428
00:51:39,139 --> 00:51:40,619
YOU'’RE EATING
YOUR LETTUCE.

1429
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:41,837
YOU'’RE JUST SITTING THERE
GOING, "UGH."

1430
00:51:41,837 --> 00:51:43,665
YOU'’VE ABANDONED
THE UTENSILS.

1431
00:51:43,665 --> 00:51:45,667
YOU ORDERED, LIKE, A KOALA.
YOU MAY AS WELL EAT LIKE ONE.

1432
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:46,668
YOU'’RE JUST, LIKE--
[groans]

1433
00:51:46,668 --> 00:51:49,541
[laughter]

1434
00:51:53,762 --> 00:51:55,590
HE'’S TALKING.

1435
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:57,201
YOU CAN'’T FOCUS
'’CAUSE YOU'’RE STARVING, RIGHT?

1436
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:58,506
HE'’S YAPPING.
YOU'’RE JUST, LIKE--[growls]

1437
00:51:58,506 --> 00:52:00,073
YOU FINISHED YOUR LETTUCE.

1438
00:52:00,073 --> 00:52:01,596
THERE'’S NO MORE WATERCRESS
ON THE PLATE.

1439
00:52:01,596 --> 00:52:02,902
YOU'’RE JUST--[groans]
YOU PULL ONE--

1440
00:52:02,902 --> 00:52:04,425
YOU'’RE LOOKING AT HIS FOOD.

1441
00:52:04,425 --> 00:52:05,513
YOU'’RE, LIKE,
"WHAT'’S THAT OVER THERE?

1442
00:52:05,513 --> 00:52:07,298
FRY."
[growls]

1443
00:52:07,298 --> 00:52:09,952
TALKING, TALKING. YOU CAN'’T
FOCUS. YOU CAN'’T FOCUS.

1444
00:52:09,952 --> 00:52:11,693
YOU'’RE NOT GETTING ANY
NUTRIENTS TO YOUR BRAIN.

1445
00:52:11,693 --> 00:52:13,739
YOU'’RE JUST KIND OF STARING OUT
THE WINDOW,

1446
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:15,262
WONDERING WHAT BIRDS
TASTE LIKE.

1447
00:52:15,262 --> 00:52:17,569
YOU'’RE JUST, LIKE--
[pants]

1448
00:52:17,569 --> 00:52:19,701
YOU FINISHED YOUR LEMON WEDGE,
LIKE, AN HOUR AGO.

1449
00:52:19,701 --> 00:52:21,312
HE'’S STILL EATING.
HE'’S STILL TALKING.

1450
00:52:21,312 --> 00:52:23,009
AND YOU'’RE--YOU'’RE STARTING
TO GET COLD NOW.

1451
00:52:23,009 --> 00:52:25,142
YOU'’RE NOT GETTING ANY NUTRITION
INTO YOUR BLOODSTREAM.

1452
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,926
YOUR SPINE IS STICKING OUT.
YOU'’RE SHIVERING.

1453
00:52:26,926 --> 00:52:28,493
YOU START--
YOU'’RE LIKE A LOST PUPPY.

1454
00:52:28,493 --> 00:52:30,712
YOU START SAYING THINGS
THAT YOU DON'’T MEAN.

1455
00:52:30,712 --> 00:52:32,453
HE'’S YAPPING. YOU START
JUST SAYING THINGS, LIKE,

1456
00:52:32,453 --> 00:52:34,499
"I WOULD LOVE TO SPEND
THE AFTERNOON WITH YOUR MOTHER.

1457
00:52:34,499 --> 00:52:37,066
"THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
AND NO, I TOTALLY CARED

1458
00:52:37,066 --> 00:52:38,764

OKAY?
WE'’RE WALKING AROUND.

AS LONG AS IT LOOKS WARM.

1566

BASED SOLELY ON THE WAY
THAT HE'’S DRESSED.

HAD TO DO THIS, RIGHT?

00:58:46,697 --> 00:58:48,786
YOU DIDN'’T TAKE THE RIDE
FROM CHIN STRAP.

1621
00:58:48,786 --> 00:58:50,831
SO YOU'’RE WALKING.
YOU'’RE COLD.

1622
00:58:50,831 --> 00:58:52,354
NO ONE KNOWS
WHERE THEY'’RE GOING

1623
00:58:52,354 --> 00:58:55,532
'’CAUSE YOU'’RE ALL RELYING
ON GIRL GPS.

1624
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,142
FOR THOSE OF YOU
THAT DON'’T KNOW,

1625
00:58:57,142 --> 00:59:00,537
GIRL GPS PRETTY MUCH CONSISTS
OF ONE GIRL DOING THIS:

1626
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:04,453
"UM..."

1627
00:59:08,675 --> 00:59:10,242
"I FEEL
LIKE IT'’S THIS WAY."

1628
00:59:10,242 --> 00:59:13,550
[laughter and applause]

1629
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:23,690
GIRLS, WHEN YOU GET DRUNK,

1630
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:25,736
WHO ARE YOU MOST LIKELY
TO PICK A FIGHT WITH?

1631
00:59:25,736 --> 00:59:26,954
YOUR BOYFRIEND.

1632
00:59:26,954 --> 00:59:28,608
DO YOU WANNA KNOW WHY?

1633
00:59:28,608 --> 00:59:29,957
'’CAUSE YOU KNOW
HE'’S NOT GONNA HIT YOU BACK.

1634
00:59:29,957 --> 00:59:31,524
[laughter]

1635
00:59:31,524 --> 00:59:33,570
EVERY GIRL IN HERE KNOWS
THAT YOUR BOYFRIEND

1636
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,223
WILL TAKE A HEALTHY DOSE
OF YOUR DRUNK RANTING.

1637
00:59:35,223 --> 00:59:37,661
WHY?

1638
00:59:37,661 --> 00:59:38,966
'’CAUSE AT THE END OF THE NIGHT
WHEN YOU'’RE ALL TUCKERED OUT,

1639
00:59:38,966 --> 00:59:40,402
HE'’S GONNA WANT
TO MOUTH-KISS YOU

1640
00:59:40,402 --> 00:59:43,710
AND TOUCH YOUR SNOOTCH,
THAT'’S WHY.

1641
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:45,538
I HATE TO TELL YOU
IT'’S WHY THEY DO EVERYTHING.

1642
00:59:45,538 --> 00:59:47,148
IT'’S WHY THEY PUT UP
WITH YOUR ATTITUDE.

1643
00:59:47,148 --> 00:59:49,063
IT'’S WHY THEY BUY YOU
EXPENSIVE DRINKS.

1644
00:59:49,063 --> 00:59:50,848
IT'’S WHY THEY LET YOU MAKE THEM
TURN THE GAME OFF

1645
00:59:50,848 --> 00:59:52,763
SO YOU CAN SHOW THEM
WHAT YOU DID ON PINTEREST.

1646
00:59:52,763 --> 00:59:55,592
OKAY?
FOR SNOOTCHES.

1647
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,637
[laughter and applause]

1648
00:59:57,637 --> 00:59:59,770
"STEVE, COME HERE.
COME LOOK AT THIS.

1649
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:02,294
"NO, LIKE, OFF.
LIKE, TURN IT OFF.

1650
01:00:02,294 --> 01:00:03,687
"DON'’T P--
JUST, LIKE, SHUT IT OFF.

1651
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:04,949
"I WANNA SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
COME HERE.

1652
01:00:04,949 --> 01:00:07,473
COME HERE.
COME HERE."

1653
01:00:07,473 --> 01:00:09,431
"LOOK, LOOK WHAT I HAVE.
LOOK WHAT I PINNED.

1654
01:00:09,431 --> 01:00:11,085
"LOOK AT THIS.

1655
01:00:11,085 --> 01:00:15,568
IT'’S AN ENTIRE WEDDING
MADE OF CHEESE."

1656
01:00:15,568 --> 01:00:19,050
"IT CAN BE OUR WEDDING."

1657
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:23,489
"STEVEN?"

1658
01:00:23,489 --> 01:00:25,099
I CALL IT A "SNOOTCH"

1659
01:00:25,099 --> 01:00:28,015
'’CAUSE I DON'’T LIKE
THE WORD "VAGINA."

1660
01:00:28,015 --> 01:00:30,017
NO ONE SAYS "VAGINA."

1661
01:00:30,017 --> 01:00:32,280
LIKE, NO ONE SAYS THAT.
THAT'’S WEIRD.

1662
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,717
NO ONE HERE HAS EVER BEEN
HOOKING UP WITH SOMEONE

1663
01:00:33,717 --> 01:00:34,892
AND BEEN, LIKE,
"THIS FEELS GREAT.

1664
01:00:34,892 --> 01:00:36,720
CONTINUE TO TOUCH
MY VAGINA."

1665
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,025
[laughter]

1666
01:00:38,025 --> 01:00:39,331
VAGINA?
WHAT?

1667
01:00:39,331 --> 01:00:41,768
A VAGINA SOUNDS
LIKE AN INDIAN CASINO.

1668
01:00:41,768 --> 01:00:44,641
[laughter]

1669
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,644
"THIS WEEKEND AT VAGINA..."

1670
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:51,822
"WAYNE NEWTON AT VAGINA."

1671
01:00:51,822 --> 01:00:53,998
I MADE UP "SNOOTCH"
'’CAUSE IT'’S SO CUTE-SOUNDING.

1672
01:00:53,998 --> 01:00:56,827
[in high-pitched voice]
SNOOTCH.

1673
01:00:56,827 --> 01:00:58,872
SNOOTCH.

1674
01:00:58,872 --> 01:01:00,961
MAYBE IT WOULD BE,
LIKE, A CARTOON CHARACTER.

1675
01:01:00,961 --> 01:01:03,442
MAYBE IT WOULD BE,
LIKE, A CUTE, TINY,

1676
01:01:03,442 --> 01:01:07,359
FURRY...OBVIOUSLY...
CHARACTER.

1677
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:09,709
IT'’S GOT A LITTLE
TOP HAT.

1678
01:01:09,709 --> 01:01:11,232
AND MAYBE BEFORE
YOU HAVE SEX,

1679
01:01:11,232 --> 01:01:12,538
YOU HAVE
TO SUMMON SNOOTCH

1680
01:01:12,538 --> 01:01:15,149
SO HE CAN BLESS
THE WHOLE THING.

1681
01:01:15,149 --> 01:01:16,716
YEAH, THAT'’S WHAT
YOU HAVE TO DO.

1682
01:01:16,716 --> 01:01:18,022
YOU'’RE HAVING--
YOU'’RE ABOUT TO HAVE SEX.

1683
01:01:18,022 --> 01:01:19,806
YOU HAVE TO GET OUT
A SNOOTCH FLUTE

1684
01:01:19,806 --> 01:01:20,938
WHICH YOU HAVE
TO PREORDER.

1685
01:01:20,938 --> 01:01:23,070
YOU HAVE
TO ORDER THEM ONLINE.

1686
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:24,942
IT'’S A--
IT'’S A DOT-GOV SITE.

1687
01:01:24,942 --> 01:01:26,770
YOU PULL IT OUT.

1688
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:28,554
YOU'’RE, LIKE,
"YOU READY TO HAVE SEX?"

1689
01:01:28,554 --> 01:01:30,730
"SURE, LET'’S--LET'’S--
LET'’S SUMMON SNOOTCH."

1690
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:31,905
[singing]
"DOO, DOO, DOO, DOO, DOO, DOO.

1691
01:01:31,905 --> 01:01:36,997
SNOOTCH!"
[laughter and applause]

1692
01:01:36,997 --> 01:01:38,433
"HI, FOLKS."
"HI, SNOOTCH.

1693
01:01:38,433 --> 01:01:39,478
"WE WERE JUST ABOUT
TO HAVE SEX.

1694
01:01:39,478 --> 01:01:40,479
DO WE HAVE
YOUR BLESSING?"

1695
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:41,741
"WELL, YOU SURELY DO.

1696
01:01:41,741 --> 01:01:42,829
"IT WAS NICE MEETING
BOTH OF YOU,

1697
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:44,265
"BUT I BETTER BE
ON MY WAY.

1698
01:01:44,265 --> 01:01:45,484
[singing]
"DOO, DOO, DOO, DOO, DOO, DOO.

1699
01:01:45,484 --> 01:01:48,705
SNOOTCH!"
[laughter and applause]

1700
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:51,620
SO CUTE.

1701
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:53,492
I MADE UP "SNOOTCH"
'’CAUSE I DON'’T LIKE THE P-WORD.

1702
01:01:53,492 --> 01:01:55,363
I DON'’T LIKE SAYING IT.
IT'’S NOT A LADY WORD.

1703
01:01:55,363 --> 01:01:57,757
PUSSY.

1704
01:01:57,757 --> 01:01:59,324
IF I GOT TO SAY IT,
THERE'’S GONNA BE

1705
01:01:59,324 --> 01:02:01,413
AN INVOLUNTARY FACIAL SPASM
THAT COMES WITH IT.

1706
01:02:01,413 --> 01:02:02,719
YOU SHOULD
KNOW THAT.

1707
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,155
I WILL RUIN
ANY SORT OF MOMENT

1708
01:02:04,155 --> 01:02:05,852
WE HAVE GOING
IN THE BEDROOM.

1709
01:02:05,852 --> 01:02:07,201
"ALL RIGHT, BABE.
THIS IS GREAT.

1710
01:02:07,201 --> 01:02:08,899
TELL ME WHERE YOU WANT ME
TO PUT IT."

1711
01:02:08,899 --> 01:02:10,683
"I'’LL SAY IT,
BUT YOU'’RE NOT GONNA LIKE IT."

1712
01:02:10,683 --> 01:02:14,252
[laughter]

1713
01:02:14,252 --> 01:02:16,471
"COME ON. WHERE DO YOU
WANT ME TO PUT IT?"

1714
01:02:16,471 --> 01:02:18,691
"WHY DON'’T YOU PUT IT
IN MY PUSSY!"

1715
01:02:18,691 --> 01:02:23,348
[screams]

1716
01:02:23,348 --> 01:02:24,871
"I CAN'’T."
"WHAT'’D YOU SAY?"

1717
01:02:24,871 --> 01:02:26,438
"NOTHING.
I'’M FINE, I'’M FINE."

1718
01:02:26,438 --> 01:02:27,526
[sighs]
"ALL RIGHT. LET'’S DO THIS."

1719
01:02:27,526 --> 01:02:28,570
"GREAT."
"ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

1720
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:30,007
"LET'’S GET BACK TO IT.

1721
01:02:30,007 --> 01:02:31,530
ALL RIGHT, WHERE DO YOU
WANT ME TO PUT IT?"

1722
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:33,619
"WHY DON'’T YOU PUT IT
IN MY PUSSY!"

1723
01:02:33,619 --> 01:02:36,622
[screams]
"NO!"

1724
01:02:36,622 --> 01:02:39,233
IT'’S NOT A LADY WORD.
LADIES DON'’T SAY THAT WORD.

1725
01:02:39,233 --> 01:02:40,931
LIKE, GROWING UP,
DID YOUR MOM EVER SAY,

1726
01:02:40,931 --> 01:02:41,932
"PUSSY, YOU NEED
TO SHOWER?"

1727
01:02:41,932 --> 01:02:43,585
NO, SHE DIDN'’T, RIGHT?

1728
01:02:43,585 --> 01:02:46,850
NO, AND IF SHE DID,
THEN YOUR MOM WAS WHITE TRASH.

1729
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:50,114
[laughter]

1730
01:02:50,114 --> 01:02:51,811
IT'’S NOT A LADY WORD.

1731
01:02:51,811 --> 01:02:54,553
IT'’S NOT A WORD THAT WOMEN HEAR
INDEPENDENT OF MEN.

1732
01:02:54,553 --> 01:02:57,469
MOST WOMEN DON'’T HEAR THAT WORD,
LIKE, IN PROFESSIONAL ETHER.

1733
01:02:57,469 --> 01:03:00,080
NO WOMAN'’S LAYING THERE
AT THE GYNECOLOGIST.

1734
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,429
DOCTOR WALKS IN, HE'’S, LIKE--
[snorts]

1735
01:03:01,429 --> 01:03:03,736
"WHAT'’S UP?"
[clears throat]

1736
01:03:03,736 --> 01:03:06,826
"HOW'’S IT HANGIN'’?
ALL RIGHT, LET'’S SEE.

1737
01:03:06,826 --> 01:03:12,223
PUSSY CHECKS OUT ALL RIGHT."

1738
01:03:12,223 --> 01:03:13,746
"GREAT TITS, BY THE WAY.
GOOD HUSTLE.

1739
01:03:13,746 --> 01:03:17,619
GET OUTTA HERE."
[laughter and applause]

1740
01:03:21,145 --> 01:03:22,799
IT'’S--IT'’S A GUY WORD.

1741
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,452
I DON'’T CARE
THAT GUYS SAY IT.

1742
01:03:24,452 --> 01:03:26,585
BOYS ARE GROSS, AND THAT'’S
WHY WE LOVE THEM, OKAY?

1743
01:03:26,585 --> 01:03:28,195
BUT THAT'’S A GUY THING.

1744
01:03:28,195 --> 01:03:30,023
THAT'’S WHAT GUYS SAY
IN THE LOCKER ROOMS

1745
01:03:30,023 --> 01:03:32,156
WITH--WITH--
WITH ALL THEIR GROSSNESS.

1746
01:03:32,156 --> 01:03:33,679
I'’D IMAGINE THEY GO
TO THE LOCKER ROOM

1747
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:35,768
AFTER A ROUSING GAME
OF TOUCH SOFTBALL,

1748
01:03:35,768 --> 01:03:37,074
AND THEY TALK
ABOUT THE P-WORD.

1749
01:03:37,074 --> 01:03:39,206
"HEY, WHAT'’S UP?
WHAT'’S UP, BRO?

1750
01:03:39,206 --> 01:03:40,773
"WHAT'’S UP?
DID YOU GET ANY--

1751
01:03:40,773 --> 01:03:41,730
DID YOU GET ANY PUSSY
LAST NIGHT?"

1752
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:43,123
"YEAH, A WHOLE BUCKET."

1753
01:03:43,123 --> 01:03:48,085
I DON'’T KNOW
HOW YOU QUANTIFY IT.

1754
01:03:48,085 --> 01:03:50,348
I DON'’T KNOW IF IT GOES BUCKET,
MUG, RAMEKIN.

1755
01:03:50,348 --> 01:03:52,350
I DON'’T KNOW.

1756
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:54,613
BUT THAT'’S WHAT GUYS DO
IN THE LOCKER ROOMS

1757
01:03:54,613 --> 01:03:56,528
WITH THE BUTT SLAPS
AND THE SWORD FIGHTING.

1758
01:03:56,528 --> 01:04:00,184
THAT'’S WHAT THEY DO.

1759
01:04:00,184 --> 01:04:01,794
WE KNOW ABOUT THAT.

1760
01:04:01,794 --> 01:04:03,448
WE KNOW YOU DO WEIRD THINGS
WITH EACH OTHER

1761
01:04:03,448 --> 01:04:04,971
WITH YOUR WIENERS
'’CAUSE YOU DO WEIRD THINGS

1762
01:04:04,971 --> 01:04:06,581
WITH US, AND YOU'’RE TRYING
TO IMPRESS US.

1763
01:04:06,581 --> 01:04:10,107
SO I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
WHAT CREEPINESS

1764
01:04:10,107 --> 01:04:11,760
GOES ON BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.

1765
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,850
I'’VE SEEN IT FIRSTHAND.

1766
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,329
EVERY GIRL HAS.

1767
01:04:15,329 --> 01:04:16,765
EVERY GIRL'’S
HAD THAT BOYFRIEND

1768
01:04:16,765 --> 01:04:18,332
WHERE YOU'’RE SITTING
ON THE BED

1769
01:04:18,332 --> 01:04:20,073
IN YOUR TARGET
UNDERWEAR WAITING.

1770
01:04:20,073 --> 01:04:22,249
HE COMES OUT
OF THE BATHROOM NAKED

1771
01:04:22,249 --> 01:04:23,685
EXCEPT FOR A T-SHIRT.

1772
01:04:23,685 --> 01:04:27,559
NO BOTTOMS,
DONALD DUCKING IT THE WHOLE WAY.

1773
01:04:27,559 --> 01:04:31,432
[laughter and applause]

1774
01:04:36,481 --> 01:04:37,874
HE'’S GOT THIS GRIN
ON HIS FACE.

1775
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,050
AND HE'’S JUST, LIKE,
"HEY, BABE.

1776
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:43,488
BABE, CHECK THIS OUT."

1777
01:04:43,488 --> 01:04:46,447
[laughter]

1778
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:51,844
WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT?

1779
01:04:51,844 --> 01:04:55,108
ON BEHALF
OF ALL WOMEN, WHY?

1780
01:04:55,108 --> 01:04:58,938
IT'’S NEVER GONNA CHANGE
A GIRL'’S MIND, EVER.

1781
01:04:58,938 --> 01:05:00,200
YOU ARE NOT
HELPING YOURSELF.

1782
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,072
NO WOMAN,
I PROMISE YOU, EVER--

1783
01:05:02,072 --> 01:05:04,291
YOU'’RE SITTING THERE
DOING THAT LIKE A CIRCUS MONKEY,

1784
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:07,860
NO GIRL IS GONNA
TURN AROUND, LIKE...

1785
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:10,776
[sighs]

1786
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:17,435
"MY, MY, MY."

1787
01:05:17,435 --> 01:05:19,089
"YOU KNOW WHAT'’S CRAZY?

1788
01:05:19,089 --> 01:05:22,005
"UM...

1789
01:05:22,005 --> 01:05:26,923
"I DIDN'’T WANT TO HAVE SEX
WITH YOU BEFORE.

1790
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,795
"BUT NOW...

1791
01:05:29,795 --> 01:05:35,627
"NOW THAT YOU'’VE DISPLAYED
THE AGILITY..."

1792
01:05:35,627 --> 01:05:39,413
"OF YOUR FLACCID PENIS...

1793
01:05:39,413 --> 01:05:44,288
"AS IT SLAPS
IN RHYTHMIC REPETITION...

1794
01:05:44,288 --> 01:05:46,029
"AGAINST EITHER ONE

1795
01:05:46,029 --> 01:05:49,858
"OF YOUR CLEARLY
NEVER-SEEN-BY-THE-SUN THIGHS,

1796
01:05:49,858 --> 01:05:53,514
NOW, SNOOTCH TIME."

1797
01:05:53,514 --> 01:05:57,388
[laughter and applause]

1798
01:06:08,529 --> 01:06:11,489
IN CLOSING, I WOULD...
[chuckles]

1799
01:06:11,489 --> 01:06:13,708
IN CLOSING,
I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE

1800
01:06:13,708 --> 01:06:16,494
THE GIRLS IN THIS ROOM
A BIT OF ADVICE, OKAY?

1801
01:06:16,494 --> 01:06:18,844
I HAVE A TIP FOR YOU,
BUT JUST THE TIP.

1802
01:06:18,844 --> 01:06:21,760
[laughter and applause]

1803
01:06:24,937 --> 01:06:29,724
LADIES, NEVER ORDER A LOBSTER
ON A DATE.

1804
01:06:29,724 --> 01:06:31,335
THE LOBSTER IS THE MOST

1805
01:06:31,335 --> 01:06:33,641
EXPENSIVE THING
ON THE MENU, OKAY?

1806
01:06:33,641 --> 01:06:37,254
SO JUST KNOW THAT IF YOU ORDER
AND CONSUME A LOBSTER,

1807
01:06:37,254 --> 01:06:40,431
YOU HAVE TO TOUCH
YOUR DATE'’S WEINER.

1808
01:06:40,431 --> 01:06:42,215
YOU HAVE TO, OKAY?

1809
01:06:42,215 --> 01:06:45,958
IT'’S LIKE A SEXUAL CONTRACT
FROM THE SEA.

1810
01:06:45,958 --> 01:06:49,353
[laughter]

1811
01:06:49,353 --> 01:06:51,529
IT'’S BINDING.

1812
01:06:51,529 --> 01:06:55,098
NOW, KEEP IN MIND HE WANTS YOU
TO GET THE LOBSTER.

1813
01:06:55,098 --> 01:06:57,056
HE'’S NOT GONNA
MAKE YOU GET IT,

1814
01:06:57,056 --> 01:06:59,406
BUT HE'’S HOPING YOU'’LL COME
TO THAT CONCLUSION ON YOUR OWN.

1815
01:06:59,406 --> 01:07:01,147
HE'’S HOPING YOU'’LL BE FLIPPING
THROUGH THE MENU,

1816
01:07:01,147 --> 01:07:03,236
AND YOU'’LL BE, LIKE,
"I DON'’T KNOW WHAT TO GET.

1817
01:07:03,236 --> 01:07:04,498
"LIKE, I'’M JUST--I DON'’T KNOW.
I'’M EATING FRESH THIS WEEK.

1818
01:07:04,498 --> 01:07:06,544
"I'’M EATING A LOT
OF FRESH THINGS.

1819
01:07:06,544 --> 01:07:08,589
"THAT'’S MY NEW THING, FRESH.
I'’M JUST GONNA DO FRESH FOOD."

1820
01:07:08,589 --> 01:07:10,765
[gasps]
"LOBSTER?

1821
01:07:10,765 --> 01:07:12,724
"SHOULD I--SHOULD I GET IT?
SHOULD I GET IT?

1822
01:07:12,724 --> 01:07:14,334
"SHOULD I GET
THE LOBSTER?

1823
01:07:14,334 --> 01:07:15,596
"SHOULD I CRACK IT OPEN
ON MY HEAD LIKE AN OTTER,

1824
01:07:15,596 --> 01:07:16,597
"EAT IT OFF
MY CHEST?

1825
01:07:16,597 --> 01:07:18,077
LOBSTER?"

1826
01:07:18,077 --> 01:07:19,644
"YEAH, '’CAUSE THEN,
IT'’S WEINER TIME

1827
01:07:19,644 --> 01:07:21,385
THIS SUNDAY AT VAGINA."

1828
01:07:21,385 --> 01:07:25,302
[laughter and applause]

1829
01:07:25,302 --> 01:07:27,130
HERE'’S HOW IT'’S GONNA
GO DOWN, OKAY?

1830
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:28,392
YOU'’RE GONNA BE
MAKING OUT LATER.

1831
01:07:28,392 --> 01:07:30,220
AND NOW, GUYS,
THIS IS FOR YOU TO KNOW.

1832
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:32,309
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
AS GIRLS,

1833
01:07:32,309 --> 01:07:34,485
WE LIKE TO MAKE OUT WITH YOU
WHEN WE FIRST MEET YOU.

1834
01:07:34,485 --> 01:07:36,226
WE LIKE TO MAKE OUT WITH YOU
A COUPLE TIMES

1835
01:07:36,226 --> 01:07:37,705
AND THEN LEAVE
RIGHT WHEN YOU THINK

1836
01:07:37,705 --> 01:07:39,490
WE'’RE GONNA SLEEP
WITH YOU, OKAY?

1837
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:41,448
WE DO IT TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU LIKE US.

1838
01:07:41,448 --> 01:07:42,797
BUT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW
THE TRUTH,

1839
01:07:42,797 --> 01:07:46,540
THEY TEACH US THIS SHIT
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

1840
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:48,499
WHILE YOU WERE OFF BUILDING
A BIRDHOUSE IN SHOP CLASS,

1841
01:07:48,499 --> 01:07:50,283
WE WERE OFF LEARNING
HOW TO BE ANNOYING.

1842
01:07:50,283 --> 01:07:52,242
HERE'’S HOW IT HAPPENS.

1843
01:07:52,242 --> 01:07:53,547
YOU'’RE GONNA BE
MAKING OUT.

1844
01:07:53,547 --> 01:07:54,766
AND YOU'’LL NOTICE
THAT WHEN A GIRL

1845
01:07:54,766 --> 01:07:56,028
MAKES OUT WITH YOU
AND LEAVES YOU,

1846
01:07:56,028 --> 01:07:57,203
WE ALWAYS LEAVE
IN A VERY SWEET WAY

1847
01:07:57,203 --> 01:07:58,596
BECAUSE WE WANT YOU
TO HAVE

1848
01:07:58,596 --> 01:08:00,902
A NICE IMPRESSION OF US
FOR LATER, RIGHT?

1849
01:08:00,902 --> 01:08:03,079
SO IT'’S ALWAYS, LIKE,
"OKAY, WELL, I GOTTA GO.

1850
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,603
BYE." [mimics baaing]
NO, YOU DIDN'’T. NO.

1851
01:08:05,603 --> 01:08:08,301
"BYE. I LOVE YOU TOO.
STOP IT." [mimics baaing]

1852
01:08:08,301 --> 01:08:09,781
IT'’S ALWAYS
VERY SWEET, RIGHT?

1853
01:08:09,781 --> 01:08:11,565
I'’VE GONE AS FAR
AS TO SOMETIMES BRING

1854
01:08:11,565 --> 01:08:13,176
A LITTLE THING
OF VANILLA BODY SPRAY.

1855
01:08:13,176 --> 01:08:14,351
AND WHEN HE GETS UP
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM,

1856
01:08:14,351 --> 01:08:15,700
I SPRAY IT ON HIS PILLOW.

1857
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:16,875
THAT WAY, LATER,
WHEN HE TEXTS ME,

1858
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:18,181
HE'’S LIKE, "OH, MY GOD.

1859
01:08:18,181 --> 01:08:19,791
MY PILLOW STILL SMELLS
LIKE YOU."

1860
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:22,402
I'’M LIKE, "THAT'’S AMAZING."

1861
01:08:22,402 --> 01:08:23,795
"I DON'’T KNOW WHY."

1862
01:08:23,795 --> 01:08:25,275
YOU CAN GET CREATIVE
WITH IT.

1863
01:08:25,275 --> 01:08:26,972
YOU CAN TAKE A HANDFUL
OF GLITTER ON YOUR DATE.

1864
01:08:26,972 --> 01:08:28,408
AND THEN AFTER YOU'’RE LEAVING,
JUST BE, LIKE,

1865
01:08:28,408 --> 01:08:30,584
"OKAY, I GOTTA GO."
[blows into microphone]

1866
01:08:30,584 --> 01:08:32,195
"BYE."

1867
01:08:32,195 --> 01:08:34,849
YOU CAN BRING A SMOKE BOMB...
[mimics exploding]

1868
01:08:34,849 --> 01:08:36,155
AND THEN, LIKE,
STILL BE STANDING THERE

1869
01:08:36,155 --> 01:08:39,071
'’CAUSE YOU DON'’T KNOW MAGIC.

1870
01:08:39,071 --> 01:08:40,420
GIRLS ALWAYS LEAVE
IN A SWEET WAY.

1871
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:41,856
WE NEVER LEAVE
IN A HUFF.

1872
01:08:41,856 --> 01:08:43,293
IT'’S NEVER, LIKE,
"WELL, I GOT MINE.

1873
01:08:43,293 --> 01:08:44,903
EAT MY SHIT LATER, FUCK-TARD."

1874
01:08:44,903 --> 01:08:46,992
[mimics thudding]

1875
01:08:46,992 --> 01:08:48,733
NEVER DOING THAT.

1876
01:08:48,733 --> 01:08:50,300
SO WE'’RE GONNA BE
MAKING OUT LATER.

1877
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:51,692
AND HERE'’S
HOW IT'’S GONNA GO.

1878
01:08:51,692 --> 01:08:52,911
WE'’RE GONNA BE
MAKING OUT, OKAY?

1879
01:08:52,911 --> 01:08:54,956
SO THIS IS
MAKING OUT, OKAY?

1880
01:08:54,956 --> 01:08:56,828
I'’M 12, THIS IS WHAT MAKING OUT
LOOKS LIKE.

1881
01:08:56,828 --> 01:08:58,221
AND THE GUY'’S
GONNA BE, LIKE,

1882
01:08:58,221 --> 01:08:59,657
"OH, I LIKE MAKING OUT WITH YOU
SO MUCH."

1883
01:08:59,657 --> 01:09:01,137
"I LIKE MAKING OUT
WITH YOU."

1884
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,008
"TONIGHT WAS SO FUN."
"IT WAS REALLY FUN."

1885
01:09:03,008 --> 01:09:04,270
"YOU'’RE SO HOT."
"I KNOW."

1886
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:05,750
"THIS IS SO FUN.
I REALLY LIKE YOU.

1887
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:07,143
YOU'’RE SO PRETTY."
"I KNOW, THIS IS GREAT.

1888
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:09,884
I AM PRETTY."
"OH, I LIKE YOU A LOT.

1889
01:09:09,884 --> 01:09:13,105
SO YOU WANNA KEEP GOING?"
GIRLS, THAT'’S YOUR CUE.

1890
01:09:13,105 --> 01:09:15,586
"ALL RIGHT, WELL, I GOTTA GO."
"WHAT?"

1891
01:09:15,586 --> 01:09:19,329
"I GOTTA GO, BYE."

1892
01:09:19,329 --> 01:09:21,548
"LATER."
[mimics baaing]

1893
01:09:21,548 --> 01:09:23,855
AND THE GUY
IS GONNA TRY

1894
01:09:23,855 --> 01:09:26,205
TO GET YOU TO STAY, RIGHT?
AS HE SHOULD.

1895
01:09:26,205 --> 01:09:28,294
YOU CAN'’T JUST WALK
OUT OF A SPIDER'’S WEB.

1896
01:09:28,294 --> 01:09:30,557
[laughter]

1897
01:09:30,557 --> 01:09:32,211
"YOU'’RE REALLY GONNA GO?
COME ON. COME ON.

1898
01:09:32,211 --> 01:09:35,258
"AMBER.
YOU REALLY GONNA GO?

1899
01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:40,263
YOU REALLY GONNA GO?"

1900
01:09:42,482 --> 01:09:46,225
"REALLY GONNA GO?"

1901
01:09:46,225 --> 01:09:49,707
[indistinct]

1902
01:09:49,707 --> 01:09:53,798
[trilling]

1903
01:09:53,798 --> 01:09:57,628
"REALLY JUST GO?
YOU'’RE JUST GONNA GO? HUH?"

1904
01:09:57,628 --> 01:10:01,501
[laughter and applause]

1905
01:10:04,765 --> 01:10:08,682
[laughter]

1906
01:10:14,253 --> 01:10:15,733
"YOU'’RE JUST GONNA LEAVE IT
LIKE THIS?"

1907
01:10:15,733 --> 01:10:17,952
"I'’M SORRY.

1908
01:10:17,952 --> 01:10:19,476
"WERE WE IN THE MIDDLE
OF OPEN HEART SURGERY?

1909
01:10:19,476 --> 01:10:20,607
"I'’M PRETTY SURE
YOU'’RE FINE.

1910
01:10:20,607 --> 01:10:22,348
"YEAH.

1911
01:10:22,348 --> 01:10:24,916
"I'’M NOT A DOCTOR PER SE,
BUT I'’M FAIRLY CONFIDENT

01:10:24,916 --> 01:10:26,526
"THAT BLOOD WILL RETURN
TO YOUR SYSTEM.

1913
01:10:26,526 --> 01:10:29,355
WALK IT OFF, CHAMP."
[laughter and applause]

1914
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:32,576
THAT MIGHT SOUND HARSH,

1915
01:10:32,576 --> 01:10:34,273
BUT IT TOOK TEN YEARS
OF ME DATING

1916
01:10:34,273 --> 01:10:36,580
TO LEARN THAT A BONER
ISN'’T A MEDICAL CONDITION.

1917
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:38,669
SO I'’M PAYING YOU BACK
RIGHT NOW.

1918
01:10:38,669 --> 01:10:42,586
[laughter and applause]

1919
01:10:42,586 --> 01:10:44,109
NOW, HE'’S PISSED,

1920
01:10:44,109 --> 01:10:45,545
MOSTLY BECAUSE HE HAS
A RAGING ERECTION

1921
01:10:45,545 --> 01:10:47,243
AND YOU CALLED HIM "CHAMP."

1922
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:49,680
NOW, HE'’S MAD.

1923
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,464
"REALLY? YOU'’RE GONNA GO?
THAT'’S MESSED UP.

1924
01:10:51,464 --> 01:10:53,161
THAT'’S MESSED UP!"
[growls]

1925
01:10:53,161 --> 01:10:54,598
"IT'’S MESSED UP, AMBER.
YOU'’RE JUST GONNA GO.

1926
01:10:54,598 --> 01:10:56,339
"LET ME...
JUST GONNA GO?

1927
01:10:56,339 --> 01:10:57,905
"IT'’S FUNNY.
IT'’S FUNNY.

1928
01:10:57,905 --> 01:11:00,081
"YOU'’RE JUST GONNA GO
'’CAUSE, UH...HUH.

1929
01:11:00,081 --> 01:11:04,521
I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER
I BOUGHT YOU A LOBSTER."

1930
01:11:04,521 --> 01:11:08,873
[laughter and applause]

1931
01:11:08,873 --> 01:11:12,790
THE MAN'’S RIGHT.
TIME TO PAY THE PIPER.

1932
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:14,748
GIRLS, YOU DO NOT HAVE
TO SLEEP WITH HIM.

1933
01:11:14,748 --> 01:11:18,709
IT'’S JUST A CRUSTACEAN.
THAT'’S RIDICULOUS, ALL RIGHT?

1934
01:11:18,709 --> 01:11:20,972
BUT YOU GOT
TO GIVE HIM SOMETHING.

1935
01:11:20,972 --> 01:11:23,409
I-I SUGGEST A BEEJ.
THAT'’S WHAT I SUGGEST.

1936
01:11:23,409 --> 01:11:24,932
[laughter]

1937
01:11:24,932 --> 01:11:26,673
THAT'’S PROPER.
DON'’T DO A HAND JOB.

1938
01:11:26,673 --> 01:11:28,240
THAT'’S RIDICULOUS.
THAT'’S CHILD'’S PLAY.

1939
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,808
[laughter and applause]

1940
01:11:30,808 --> 01:11:32,940
HAND JOB?
A HANDY? REALLY?

1941
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:34,986
AS A GROWN WOMAN, YOU'’RE NOT
DOING A HAND JOB, OKAY?

1942
01:11:34,986 --> 01:11:36,683
IF YOU VOTED,
YOU'’RE NOT DOING A HAND JOB.

1943
01:11:36,683 --> 01:11:38,859
[laughter]

1944
01:11:38,859 --> 01:11:41,079
LET'’S SEND SOME HAND JOBS
OVERSEAS TO CHINA.

1945
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:44,300
[laughter and applause]

1946
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,866
NOT DOING A HAND JOB.

1947
01:11:45,866 --> 01:11:47,259
A HAND JOB, WHO DOES--
THAT'’S WHAT KIDS DO

1948
01:11:47,259 --> 01:11:48,869
WHEN YOU'’RE,
LIKE, A TEENAGER.

1949
01:11:48,869 --> 01:11:51,089
YOU DO A HAND JOB.
YOU PUT ON YOUR PROMISE RING.

1950
01:11:51,089 --> 01:11:53,178
YOU REVEL IN YOUR VIRGINITY
FOR THE NEXT 10 TO 15 YEARS

1951
01:11:53,178 --> 01:11:54,919
DEPENDING ON YOUR INVOLVEMENT
WITH COMIC BOOKS.

1952
01:11:54,919 --> 01:11:56,355
THAT'’S WHAT A HAND JOB
IS FOR.

1953
01:11:56,355 --> 01:11:58,357
AS AN ADULT,
IT'’S NOT HAPPENING.

1954
01:11:58,357 --> 01:12:00,490
IT'’S AN INTERMEDIARY STEP
IN A SEXUAL EVOLUTION

1955
01:12:00,490 --> 01:12:02,579
THAT YOU'’VE
EVOLVED PAST, OKAY?

1956
01:12:02,579 --> 01:12:07,366
IT'’S LIKE A TAIL...

1957
01:12:07,366 --> 01:12:08,846
NECESSARY AT ONE POINT
FOR BALANCE,

1958
01:12:08,846 --> 01:12:10,369
BUT IF YOU BUSTED IT OUT
AT A HOUSE PARTY,

1959
01:12:10,369 --> 01:12:12,589
PEOPLE WOULD BE,
LIKE, WEIRDED OUT.

1960
01:12:12,589 --> 01:12:17,071
[laughter]

1961
01:12:17,071 --> 01:12:20,205
I WAS OUT WITH A GUY ONE TIME
WHO I WASN'’T EVEN INTO.

1962
01:12:20,205 --> 01:12:23,513
I DIDN'’T WANT TO DO ANYTHING.
AND HE DIDN'’T BUY ME A LOBSTER.

1963
01:12:23,513 --> 01:12:24,514
AND I WAS--
I EXPLAINED EVERYTHING.

1964
01:12:24,514 --> 01:12:26,167
AND AFTER TALKING
TO HIM,

1965
01:12:26,167 --> 01:12:28,605
HE'’S LIKE,
"I'’D LIKE A HAND JOB."

1966
01:12:28,605 --> 01:12:30,171
[laughter]

1967
01:12:30,171 --> 01:12:31,912
"I THINK
IT SOUNDS GREAT."

1968
01:12:31,912 --> 01:12:33,740
AND I GUESS
I WAS FRUSTRATED

1969
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:36,003
'’CAUSE HE HADN'’T BEEN LISTENING
TO ME OR MY FEELINGS.

1970
01:12:36,003 --> 01:12:37,265
AND I WAS LIKE,
"ALL RIGHT.

1971
01:12:37,265 --> 01:12:39,790
"I'’LL TELL YOU WHAT, SON.

1972
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:42,575
"I'’M GONNA GIVE YOU
A HAND JOB.

1973
01:12:42,575 --> 01:12:44,098
BUT IT'’S GONNA BE
ON MY TERMS."

1974
01:12:44,098 --> 01:12:45,839
[laughter]

1975
01:12:45,839 --> 01:12:48,712
"45 MINUTES LONG..."

1976
01:12:53,238 --> 01:12:56,110
"NO LOTION..."
[laughter and applause]

1977
01:12:58,809 --> 01:13:00,245
"AND YOU DON'’T BREAK
EYE CONTACT.

1978
01:13:00,245 --> 01:13:04,162
GO!"

1979
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:15,739
[cheers and applause]

1980
01:13:15,739 --> 01:13:20,657
[coughs and sighs]

1981
01:13:20,657 --> 01:13:24,182
WHAT KILLS ME IS THAT YOU GET
THAT I'’M KIDDING.

1982
01:13:24,182 --> 01:13:27,446
HE DID NOT.

1983
01:13:27,446 --> 01:13:30,318
I SWEAR TO GOD HE GOES,
"AW, NO LOTION?"

1984
01:13:30,318 --> 01:13:33,147
[laughter]

1985
01:13:33,147 --> 01:13:34,453
"THAT DOESN'’T SOUND FUN."

1986
01:13:34,453 --> 01:13:36,499
LIKE THE 45-MINUTE PART
IS TOLERABLE?

1987
01:13:36,499 --> 01:13:38,936
[laughter]

1988
01:13:38,936 --> 01:13:41,068
"ILIZA, COME ON.
YOU GOTTA DO SOMETHING.

1989
01:13:41,068 --> 01:13:43,636
YOU GOTTA GIVE ME LOTION
OR DO SOMETHING CUTE."

1990
01:13:43,636 --> 01:13:46,639
IT THREW ME OFF
THAT HE SAID "CUTE"

1991
01:13:46,639 --> 01:13:48,511
BECAUSE THAT'’S NOT AN ADJECTIVE
I BELIEVE

1992
01:13:48,511 --> 01:13:53,124
BELONGS ANYWHERE
NEAR AN H.J.

1993
01:13:53,124 --> 01:13:54,734
IT SOUNDED CREEPY
IN A WAY.

1994
01:13:54,734 --> 01:13:56,562
I WAS LIKE,
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN '’CUTE'’?

1995
01:13:56,562 --> 01:13:58,434
"WHAT--WHAT'’S CUTE?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

1996
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,348
WHAT DO YOU WANT,
KITTEN PAWS?"

1997
01:14:00,348 --> 01:14:03,264
[laughter]

1998
01:14:17,017 --> 01:14:19,585
IT'’S PROBABLY HOW THAT ONE CAT
LOST HIS EYE.

1999
01:14:19,585 --> 01:14:20,804
YOU GUYS ARE FANTASTIC.

2000
01:14:20,804 --> 01:14:22,066
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING OUT.

2001
01:14:22,066 --> 01:14:25,939
[cheers and applause]

2002
01:14:27,419 --> 01:14:30,335
[upbeat music]
