1
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,480
- Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:15,616
Iliza Shlesinger!

3
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:26,294
- All right!

4
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:29,530
Dallas, Texas!

5
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:31,265
Thank you.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,074

7
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,843
Oh.

8
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,545
How are you guys doing?
Thank you for coming out, y'all.

9
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:46,414
Fantastic.

10
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:50,751
I am so excited and honored
to be shooting my hour special

11
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,220
in my hometown of Dallas, Texas.

12
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:54,488
Yes, ma'am.

13
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:58,092
I'm so excited to be here.

14
00:00:58,126 --> 00:00:59,827
Not thrilled with getting here.

15
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,329
I have to be honest.

16
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:05,699
I fly enough that I feel
I have the right to say this.

17
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,136
If you work for an airline,

18
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:10,304
I hate you.

19
00:01:10,338 --> 00:01:12,340
Okay?
I hate you.

20
00:01:12,373 --> 00:01:13,707
And I don't want to hear,

21
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,709
"No, my cousin Sheila's
a real sweetheart.

22
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:16,610
She works for Southwest."

23
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:18,479
Fuck your cousin Sheila.

24
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:22,183
All right, your cousin Sheila's
a goddamn bitch.

25
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:24,552
And I'll tell you
something else.

26
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,120
The only reason
people work for airlines

27
00:01:26,154 --> 00:01:29,657
is because the Nazi party
is no longer hiring.

28
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,228
I don't have an issue...
Thank you.

29
00:01:34,262 --> 00:01:36,096
I don't have an issue
with flying.

30
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,098
My issue is with the boarding
of the plane.

31
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:40,301
Has anyone else here
ever had the misfortune

32
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:43,937
of being stuck
in boarding zone four?

33
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:45,373
Like, that's when
you have a seat...

34
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:47,141
You have a ticket
'cause you're holding it...

35
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:49,109
But you're so low
on the food chain,

36
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:50,778
it pretty much goes,
like, first-class,

37
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:53,046
luggage, terrorists, maybe you.

38
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:57,318
And they take
such painstaking care

39
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:59,353
to board zones
one through three.

40
00:01:59,387 --> 00:02:01,054
And if you don't fly
that airline often enough,

41
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,056
you are S.O.L. In terms
of getting on that plane

42
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,892
'cause they are boarding groups
of people

43
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:05,859
that you didn't even know

44
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:09,397
you could apply to be part of.

45
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,399
We're gonna start boarding
flight 556 to Dallas/Fort Worth.

46
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:13,367
We're gonna start boarding
zone one.

47
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:15,035
These are
our first-class passengers,

48
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,003
our first members,
our gold members,

49
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,238
our golden shower members.

50
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:19,707
There you go.
Thank you, there you go.

51
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,141
Right this way.

52
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:23,177
Our Golden Eagle members,
our Eagle Face members.

53
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:25,279
If you have an eagle face
instead of a person face

54
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:27,515
'cause you lost your face

55
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:30,551
in some sort of horrible Holiday
Turkey deep fry accident,

56
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:31,985
you didn't have enough butt fat

57
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:33,321
to get a nose grafted
onto your face,

58
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:35,155
so you had to borrow one
from an eagle,

59
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:36,056
so now you have a beak,
and you like to eat mice,

60
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,525
you can get on the plane.

61
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:39,260
Boarding zone two...
These are our silver members,

62
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:40,861
our silver star members,
our silver surfer members.

63
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,363
If anybody likes comic books,
you're a fuckin' nerd.

64
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:44,332
You can sit in the back
of the plane.

65
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:45,866
Silver hair, if you're old,
hurry the fuck up.

66
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,768
Silver spoons, if you like
Ricky Schroder, '80s TV shows,

67
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,603
you were born really wealthy,
you can get on the plane.

68
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:51,138
Silver bullet summer...
No, ma'am, you cannot bring

69
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,940
your coors light
up in this, bitch.

70
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,075
Boarding zone three.

71
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:59,647
These are our...

72
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,815
These are our Copper members,
our Copper Star members,

73
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,183
our Copper Topper members.

74
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:04,585
Is anybody using
a Duracell-operated device?

75
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:06,053
I don't give a shit
if it's a pacemaker.

76
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:06,820
You turn that off for takeoff.

77
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,055
Copperhead.

78
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:09,590
If you have a copperhead snake
as a pet

79
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,592
instead of a normal goddamn pet
like a dog or a cat,

80
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,294
you're like, "Fuck it,
I'm gonna get me a snake."

81
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,496
"Yeah, fuck you, dad.
I'm not going to law school."

82
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,197
"I'm gonna go
to Art School Online"

83
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,532
"and learn how to draw dragons"

84
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:19,667
"and manage a hot topic
in my spare time."

85
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,168
"I love my snake."

86
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,436
"I'm bringing her
to Thanksgiving."

87
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,204
"Her name is Judy.
We're in snake love."

88
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:25,072
"I love her so much.
Don't touch me, mom."

89
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:26,507
You get on the plane.

90
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,743
And boarding zone four,
you can go fuck yourself.

91
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,587
Now boarding all zones.

92
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,956
I spend a lot of time traveling.

93
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,858
Spend a lot of time in hotels.

94
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,194
And as a result of it,
I watch a lot of TV.

95
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,429
And I think
the saddest commercial out there

96
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:53,133
has to be the S.P.C.A.
Sarah McLachlan ad.

97
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,868
Seen it?

98
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,505
With the fucked up animals?

99
00:03:57,538 --> 00:04:00,408
Can I tell you a secret
about this commercial?

100
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:03,777
It knows when you're alone.

101
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,348
Do you ever notice
it only comes on

102
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:09,550
when you're by yourself,
maybe you're drunk?

103
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,420
You're vulnerable, right?

104
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:13,987
And what's crazy is at first,

105
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:16,123
yes, you are sad
for the animals.

106
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:17,658
But the longer you watch it,

107
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:21,061
the longer your sadness
kind of begins to turn on you,

108
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,296
and by the end of it, somehow,

109
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:26,367
you just feel really bad
for yourself?

110
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,336
You're sitting there,
like, "Oh, my God."

111
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:31,104
There's... that cat
doesn't have a face."

112
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,040
I don't know.
"I'm so sad.

113
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,342
"I feel so bad for him.

114
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,109
"And I feel so bad
for his cat family.

115
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:39,647
And I feel so bad for... ME."

116
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,784
"Oh, God.
What am I gonna do?

117
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,152
"What should I do?

118
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:47,755
I should... I should...
I should get a cat."

119
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,156
So you get a cat.

120
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,058
But because he's
from the S.P.C.A.,

121
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:54,862
like, let's be honest, he's all,
like, fucked up and autistic.

122
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,430
Just shits everywhere.

123
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:59,500
You're like, "oh, my God.
What did you eat?"

124
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,968
Goes through your stuff.

125
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,804
He only eats the buttons
off your good sweaters.

126
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,539
You're like, "How did you know
to go to for the good sweaters?"

127
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:07,207
"Why didn't you go
for the crappy sweaters?

128
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,678
Why do you have
such exquisite taste?"

129
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:13,414
Gotta get rid of him
'cause he's ruining everything.

130
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:16,249
But what do you do?
You can't kill him because...

131
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:18,552
Because that's fucking insane,
I guess.

132
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:19,987
But you gotta get rid of him.
So what do you do?

133
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,088
I'm gonna tell you.

134
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,391
You put kitty in the car.

135
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:25,325
You drive him to a neighborhood
he doesn't know.

136
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:30,864
You let him out of the car.

137
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:32,099
Don't worry.

138
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:36,437
The S.P.C.A.
Will find that cat.

139
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,805
I don't know if you've noticed.

140
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:42,342
They're in the business
of secondhand cattery.

141
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,512
They find the cat.
They clean him off.

142
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:48,215
They update his résumé.

143
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:50,183
He gets a job managing,
like, a Chipotle.

144
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:53,153
He's fine, all right?

145
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,422
So in honor of that commercial,

146
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:57,525
I have a treat for you guys.

147
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:06,400
This is my cat.

148
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:21,515
This is my dog Blanche,
and I adopted her.

149
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:23,350
And sometimes when you adopt
an animal,

150
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,985
you don't know their back story.

151
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:28,556
So for Blanche, I made one up.

152
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:31,158
In my house,
we pretend that Blanche

153
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:33,927
used to be a dog prostitute...

154
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:46,339
Which makes sense,
because as you can tell,

155
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:49,477
she's a little sad
behind the eyes...

156
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,144
But she clearly has no problem

157
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:52,780
with you staring
at her dog vagina.

158
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:04,692
Make it rain.

159
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:07,695
Shake it for the money.

160
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:10,197
So in honor of that commercial,
she and I are now going to do

161
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,799
our rendition of it for you.

162
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:15,035
Here we go.

163
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,107
In the arms

164
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,011
of the angel,

165
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:28,482
far away

166
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:31,318
from here,

167
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:36,824
in this dark, cold hotel room,

168
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:39,159
and the end,

169
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:43,096
dah, dah, dah, dah, dah

170
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,636
you were pulled...

171
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:51,639
That's it.
That's it for Blanche.

172
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:58,879
Let's get serious.

173
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,413
My dog is so cute,
I want to hurt her.

174
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,449
Do you ever get that way?

175
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,851
When something is so cute,
it makes you angry.

176
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:05,953
I just want to rip its nose
and...

177
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,788
You ever get that way
when something is so cute,

178
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,389
you don't know if you can
trust yourself around it?

179
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,558
I used to get that way
with my Nana.

180
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:12,526
She's, like, this tall,
and you ever hug

181
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,694
your grandparent,
and you're, like, "Oh, my God",

182
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,162
I just wanna push you
down the stairs."

183
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:17,497
You ever feel that way?

184
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:18,532
You ever feel the urge,
just, "What if I just..."

185
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:21,068
"Just feel like..."

186
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,603
Hypothetically.

187
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24,772
Sometimes, I get that way
around garbage disposals.

188
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:27,440
You ever just put your hand in
just to feel the... feel the fear?

189
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,880
You reach the other hand over.

190
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,481
You don't touch the switch,
but you hover around it?

191
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,616
You're like,
"What if I just..."

192
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:36,784
"NO!"

193
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:36,784
"No!"

194
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:43,023
I don't do that either.
It was just a joke.

195
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,859
Sometimes you get that way
with cute things, like babies.

196
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,227
Sometimes babies are so cute.

197
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,562
Sometimes babies
are not so cute.

198
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:50,430
But sometimes babies...
So cute,

199
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,699
you know,
fat, little, baby cheek.

200
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:54,501
You just want
to rip his cheek off.

201
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,340
But you can't 'cause you won't

202
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,142
be allowed
around the baby anymore.

203
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,977
That's for goddamn sure.

204
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:05,746
There was another version
of that commercial.

205
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,716
What happened was they aired
that commercial.

206
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:11,484
And it was such a hit, so many
people were adopting pets,

207
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:13,220
so many people
were donating money,

208
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:17,591
so many people were
going on antidepressants.

209
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:18,892
And they were like,
"Let's do another one."

210
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:21,461
So they tried to recreate
the magic of that one.

211
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,663
So in this commercial, they play

212
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,898
another Sarah McLachlan song,
okay?

213
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:28,235
I don't know the song,
but it's some lesbian chant.

214
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:29,202
That's happening.

215
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:34,207
And they zoom in
on these pictures

216
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,508
of these jacked up animals.

217
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,244
And at the bottom of the screen,

218
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:40,948
they put a caption
of what the animal is thinking?

219
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:46,687
Now, where they got
that information, I don't know.

220
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,789
They show a dog,
and he's all no teeth.

221
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:52,459
He's just awful-looking,
like, "Nah!"

222
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:54,227
"Where's my family?"

223
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,664
"I don't know!"

224
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,034
They show another dog,
and he's all muddy and gnarly.

225
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:03,336
He's just, "Nah!"

226
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,505
"I hope they come back
for me."

227
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,607
"Nah!

228
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:09,910
"Dad, you said you was
going for cigarettes.

229
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,079
"Why?

230
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,982
It's me, Spot."

231
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,349
And then, they showed a cat.

232
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:18,652
And this cat was,
like, 45 pounds.

233
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:21,989
It... it had one eye.

234
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:23,523
And it turned...
Do you know him?

235
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,660
And it turned around...
He turned around in slow motion,

236
00:10:26,694 --> 00:10:28,528
and it wasn't a camera trick.

237
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,131
He's just, like,
a 45-pound cat, I guess.

238
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:33,100
He doesn't have,
like, a meeting to rush to.

239
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:33,967
So he's not...

240
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:54,722
"I'm sorry
for whatever I did wrong."

241
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:56,423
No, that's where I stopped
buying that commercial.

242
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:58,992
There's no way
a cat has remorse.

243
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,829
You ever met a cat?

244
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:03,263
There's no way he's apologetic.

245
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,898
Whatever that cat did
to land him in cat jail,

246
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:06,499
he's not sorry he did it.

247
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:07,901
He's sorry he got caught.

248
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:11,171
There's a difference.

249
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:17,677
That cat's as hard as they come.
He doesn't give a shit.

250
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:19,212
He's sitting there
in his little cat cell.

251
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:22,883
He's got "Meow Mix for life"
tattooed on his little belly.

252
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,752
He's got a little rat
that he's made his bitch.

253
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:27,454
It's carving a shiv
out of cheese in the corner.

254
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:28,856
He's got one sharpened cat claw.

255
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,558
He's just running it
against the bars, like, "Brr."

256
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:33,626
"Brr."

257
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,427
Oh, yeah, he's got one eye.
I forgot.

258
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:36,897
"Brr.  Brr."

259
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,565
He's like, "hear me?"

260
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:41,334
"I don't give a fuck."

261
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:42,702
"You think I care?

262
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:44,805
"Oh, hell, yeah,
I scratched up your curtains.

263
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:47,207
And I'd do it again.
Fuck you."

264
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,411
This is a cat paw.

265
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,020
That commercial is sad.

266
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,922
The commercial that makes me
feel the worst about myself,

267
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:06,026
I would have to say, would be
the P90X commercials.

268
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:10,163
That commercial always comes on
when I'm eating...

269
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:13,066
Which is the worst time

270
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,035
for any fitness commercial
comes on 'cause it knows

271
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,137
when you're sitting there
being a little fatty,

272
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,972
eatin' Graham Crackers
with your shirt off,

273
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:20,073
SVU.

274
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:22,209
It knows.

275
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,778
And it comes on, and it gets
you, you're just sittin' there.

276
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:25,946
You're like,
"I'll never find love.

277
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,915
I don't know.
I don't..."

278
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:30,050
"Do you want to get in shape?"

279
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,720
You're like...

280
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,658
And by the way,
it's not asking you

281
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,094
if you want to get
in regular-person shape.

282
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:42,729
it's not talking
to normal people.

283
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,664
it's talking
to, like, Navy Seals.

284
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:45,966
it's talking to crazy people.

285
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,968
it's not asking you
if you want to look mediocre

286
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,837
when you go to the pool
this summer, uh-uh.

287
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,438
It's just for crazy...
it's saying,

288
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:54,241
"Hey, faggot, do you want to get
in such fucking good shape

289
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,943
"so fucking quickly
that your arms

290
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:57,811
"and your...
And your chest and your back

291
00:12:57,845 --> 00:12:59,346
"get too big to fit
through normal doorways,

292
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,249
"so every time you come through,
you smash into the plaster,

293
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,483
"and you're costing your mother
thousands of dollars

294
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:04,484
"in drywall damage?

295
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:05,986
"Is that what you want?

296
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,720
"Do you want your friends
and family to fear you

297
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:09,256
"because you drink
horse testosterone

298
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,059
"and creatine shakes,
and they make you sleep outside?

299
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:14,361
"Is that what you fuckin' want?

300
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:15,829
"Do you want to get so huge
so quickly,

301
00:13:15,863 --> 00:13:17,430
"so unnaturally,
that all your clothes

302
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,432
"shrink on you,
and they fit like baby clothes

303
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,234
"'cause you're like the hulk
mid-transformation,

304
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:23,070
"and you can't afford
to buy new clothes

305
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:26,306
'cause you spent all your money
on these fucking P90X DVDs?"

306
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,582
My question is why?

307
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,584
Why would the average guy

308
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,953
want to get that jacked
that fast?

309
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:43,690
Why? so you can, what,
be the strongest manager

310
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:47,794
at the Verizon store?

311
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,129
What are you doing
with that muscle?

312
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,398
You work in sales.
You're not guarding Sparta.

313
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:54,034
It's fine.

314
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:57,137
"This is smart phone."

315
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,574
I think P90X has
a subliminal message

316
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,376
that a lot of us are missing

317
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,045
'cause I don't think they're
talking to regular people.

318
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:08,115
I think the commercial needs
to be honest and come clean

319
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:10,850
and say what their product
is really meant for.

320
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,819
The commercial
should sound like this.

321
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,922
"Hey, P90X guy here.
What's up?

322
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:18,758
"So did you,
like, recently commit a crime,

323
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,294
"and you've been sentenced
to prison,

324
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:25,865
and you have to report there
in 90 days, so..."

325
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,241
"You figure in the interim,

326
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:35,808
"you'll just get as huge
as possible

327
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:38,178
"for fear of the safety
of your butthole?

328
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,413
P90X."

329
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:44,684
Yeah.

330
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,586
It's a prison workout.

331
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:47,921
They're like, "you can do it"

332
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:49,322
from the comfort
of your own living room."

333
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:50,723
That's 'cause your living room
and a jail cell

334
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:52,359
are roughly
the same square footage.

335
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,726
Do the math.

336
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,195
Think about it.
"No equipment.

337
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,030
No excuses."
No shit there's no equipment.

338
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,665
You'll get raped
with equipment in prison.

339
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,767
You can't have it there.

340
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,502
"We here at P90X
want you to get creative

341
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,004
"with your workout.
Fuck your antiques, bro.

342
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:05,105
"Your girlfriend's
gonna break up with you

343
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,506
"when you go to jail anyway.

344
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,108
"May as well use shit
around your house.

345
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,742
"Take your dining room table.
Cut off the back legs.

346
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,144
"Put it at an angle.

347
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:13,313
"Now, you have a bench
for incline presses.

348
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:14,948
"P90X.

349
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:16,916
"Go ahead.
Grab your old Kenwood speakers.

350
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,085
"That's right.
Take 'em off the front lawn.

351
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:19,486
"Use those for weight.

352
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,687
"You can take water bottles.
Dump that shit out.

353
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,721
"Fill 'em up with sand.

354
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,323
"Use those for bicep curls

355
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:24,992
"'cause you're too cheap
to buy a shake weight.

356
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,159
"You're gonna get enough of this
in prison.

357
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:27,527
P90X."

358
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:38,038
The problem with P90X
is that it works.

359
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:41,975
Like, yes,
it will change your body,

360
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:46,046
but only from the neck down.

361
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:48,982
They don't tell you
in the commercial

362
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:54,054
your face stays
exactly the same as it was.

363
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,756
"Do you want to have the body
of a 20-year-old Adonis,

364
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,858
"but go ahead and keep the face

365
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:02,595
"of a balding,
middle-aged accountant?

366
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,697
"P90X, disappoint your wife
from the chin up

367
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:07,600
on a nightly basis."

368
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,002
These guys at P90X,

369
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:10,337
you want to look hot,
just get in shape.

370
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,006
I think women in our country
have too many options

371
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,542
for weight loss
to the point of paralysis.

372
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,044
There's so many options.

373
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,112
You go on TV, the Internet,
women's magazines.

374
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:21,314
There's so many,
you can't even make a choice.

375
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:23,083
I was reading a women's magazin
e
the other day

376
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:25,818
'cause I wanted to punish myself

377
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,054
and just feel awful,

378
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:29,189
and they had
all these diet tips.

379
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:30,923
Diet tips for ladies.

380
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:32,559
I saw this one
in "Cosmo."

381
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:35,095
They suggested that women,
if you're on a diet,

382
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,330
"Next time you're on a diet
and you're hungry,

383
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:38,898
don't ruin the day..."
'Cause your whole day is ruined

384
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,167
if you eat a doughnut,
by the way.

385
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,170
You have
to kill yourself immediately.

386
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:45,038
"Don't ruin the day
by grabbing a fried snack.

387
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:47,374
Instead, just grab
a handful of almonds."

388
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,509
Just go out... just go and grab
a handful of almonds.

389
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,344
You ever do this?

390
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:52,945
When you're hungry, you get
a handful of... you don't do that?

391
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,047
You don't go up
to the nearest tree

392
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:55,382
and just
giraffe yourself like...

393
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,657
"Cindy, I'll be right there."

394
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,025
Handful of almonds.

395
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,460
"Cosmo" says get a handful
of almonds.

396
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:08,895
Just go ahead, get a handful
of almonds, and get a hand...

397
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,163
Why don't you go fuck yourself

398
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:11,898
with a handful
of almonds, "Cosmo"?

399
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,333
See how full you get off that.

400
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:17,370
I'm a grown woman,
not a sugar squirrel.

401
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:18,205
Almonds.

402
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:20,273
Juicing.
that's a big thing.

403
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:21,974
"Why don't you just juice it?
Do you want to just juice?

404
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:23,976
"We should do juices
and smoothies.

405
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,345
You wanna make
a smoothie?"

406
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,347
You pronounce smoothie like this

407
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,549
'cause you only need this much
of your mouth open to drink it.

408
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,721
Smoothie.

409
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:35,955
They want women to do this.

410
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,190
Take all your food,
juice it down.

411
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:38,925
Go get your carrots.
Get your kale.

412
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,094
Don't forget the kale.
Get your kale.

413
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:42,662
Get the apples.
Put it in the juicer.

414
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,231
Go ahead and juice the apple
and the celery.

415
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:46,032
Put your hand in the juicer.
Juice your hand down.

416
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,500
Juice your hand
right down to the nub.

417
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:49,369
Make sure you juice all of it.
You'll lose 2 ounces.

418
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,038
Drink your hand, there's lots
of nutrients in your hand.

419
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,973
"Cosmo" never said
to juice your hand.

420
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:54,707
I'm just gonna
put that out there.

421
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,176
Make a smoothie.

422
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:57,910
Do you have time in the morning
to make a smoothie?

423
00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:58,978
You have time for this?

424
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,080
No?
shocking.

425
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:02,315
You don't have time
in the morning

426
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:05,118
to go out to your own
personal botanical garden

427
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:07,287
and cut down
a brontosaurus brunch

428
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,855
worth of broccoli and asparagus,

429
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:09,889
juice it down to an ounce,

430
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,591
so you can shit green
for a week?

431
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,092
You don't have time?

432
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,365
I love being
a stand-up comedian.

433
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:21,501
It's probably the best job ever.

434
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,203
Uh, if I could have any job...

435
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:24,937
If I could have any job,
I would be a cat.

436
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:27,274
But that is not something

437
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:30,977
I'm supposed
to talk about in public.

438
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,679
If I could have any job
besides this,

439
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:36,949
I know this sounds weird,
but I would be a pharmacist

440
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:39,018
because I would be...

441
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,453
Like, I would add
something cool to it.

442
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:42,889
I would be, like, a different
kind of pharmacist, okay?

443
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:44,090
So I would
do it differently, okay?

444
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,092
So... so I would look
like a pharmacist.

445
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,327
I would wear the white coat,

446
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,861
'cause without the white coat,

447
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:50,630
you're just a drug dealer.

448
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:55,001
I'd wear the white coat,
but under it,

449
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:56,236
I would go to, like,
a renaissance fair.

450
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:58,438
- We have renaissance fairs here?
- Yeah.

451
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,507
- Yes! of course we do.
Every state's got white trash.

452
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,211
Of course we do.
So I'd go to a renaissance fair.

453
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:06,413
And I would go to, like,
the witch doctor's tent.

454
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:09,316
And I would get one of those,
like, medieval witch woman belts

455
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,117
that has, like, some leather.

456
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,085
And it's got bells
and raccoon pelts

457
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,488
and a jug
for your ale, whatever.

458
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:18,225
And it'd have, like, a jar
of pigeon whisperers.

459
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:20,026
I'd have all these things,
all the accoutrement

460
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,461
of a creepy witch on my belt.

461
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,530
And I'd put it under the coat
so that when I walked,

462
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:25,998
the coat would flare open,
and you'd get glimpses

463
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:27,667
of my medieval trickery
under it.

464
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,469
Just...

465
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,438
And you'd be in line
at the pharmacy.

466
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,406
And you'd be like, "What's up
with that one pharmacist?"

467
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,174
"Is she into the dark arts?

468
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,043
"Is she a sorceress?
Magic with a 'k'?

469
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:39,746
Does she play "Skyrim" alone?
What is that?"

470
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:43,250
And I wouldn't come up
to the counter.

471
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:45,218
Instead... instead of a bell
that you ring,

472
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:47,320
I would get...
I would get a raven.

473
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:49,622
I would stuff a raven.

474
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:52,158
And I would give it a beard.
I'd glue on the beard.

475
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,693
I would spend my time
gluing the beard on,

476
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,362
and it would have a beard, and
I would sit him on the perch,

477
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,230
so when you came up
to the counter,

478
00:19:57,264 --> 00:19:58,531
you'd have to pull the beard.

479
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:02,469
And then the raven will go...

480
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:04,871
That's my cue to appear.

481
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:08,508
And then I'd... pfft.
Yes?

482
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,010
Secretly, I was waiting under
the counter to hear the raven.

483
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,380
And then... pfft.
Yes?

484
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:14,714
I was right there.
There's no magic.

485
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:15,748
I'm right there.

486
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:18,050
Yes, my child?

487
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,786
I call you my child

488
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,954
'cause that's what
creepy people do.

489
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:23,423
Yes?

490
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:25,057
And you'd hand me
your prescription.

491
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:28,194
And I'd say,
"Okay, one moment."

492
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,897
And I'd have a hump.
Oh, yeah, I have a hump.

493
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,031
You gotta have a hump.

494
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,032
If you're gonna be
making medicine,

495
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,734
you gotta have a hump

496
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:37,904
'cause the hump says
that you're serious.

497
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:39,138
A hump is your calling card.

498
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,140
A hump says,
"I'm not out partying.

499
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,275
"I'm not out getting drunk.

500
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:44,277
"I'm downstairs in the basement

501
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:47,380
"studying alchemy and...
And witchery.

502
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,081
"And I'm learning how to turn

503
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,216
"newt thoughts
into rat eyeballs.

504
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,851
"I'm doing things like that.

505
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:54,186
"I'm learning the proper use
for an Erlenmeyer flask.

506
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,088
I'm down there
doing these things, okay?"

507
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:57,890
So I have the hump, and then...

508
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:00,026
And then, I'd take your...
I'd take your prescription.

509
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:04,063
And... one moment.

510
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,667
I have a limp too...

511
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,035
'Cause the limp

512
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:11,704
comes with the hump, standard.

513
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,442
And then I would set to work
making your medicine.

514
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:17,444
So I'd be back here,
and I would have my back to you.

515
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:19,546
And I'd... I'd have
all these sound effects

516
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:22,181
on, like, a keyboard ready,
so you would be standing there.

517
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,249
And you'd hear like...

518
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:28,220
"Eh, one moment."

519
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:34,461
And I would also have
a closed-circuit TV right here,

520
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:37,664
so I could watch everything
in the pharmacy, okay?

521
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:39,466
So you would go to,
like, touch something,

522
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:41,133
and I would see you on the TV.

523
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:42,535
And I would just say this,

524
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:45,505
"I wouldn't touch that
if I were you."

525
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:48,441
But I'm just watching you.

526
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:50,343
And I have...
And, like, an hour later,

527
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:52,945
I'd emerge with your medicine

528
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,280
in the orange bottle.

529
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,848
Like, I didn't make your shit.

530
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:57,984
I had it ready to go.

531
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:00,487
I was just wasting your time...

532
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,854
'Cause a hump suggests
that I'm making it,

533
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:03,790
so I want you
to follow that fantasy.

534
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,058
I didn't... I don't know how
to make medicine out of herbs.

535
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:07,026
I'm not Chinese.

536
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:11,030
So I have it.

537
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,231
And I'd come up to the counter.

538
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,766
And I'd say...
And I'd set it down.

539
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,004
And I'd say, "Would you like
a consultation?"

540
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:21,974
And you'd say, "Sure."
And I'd say, "Okay."

541
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,643
And I'd hold up your pill
to the light.

542
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,478
I shouldn't touch your medicine,
but I'm going to.

543
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:28,180
I'd hold it up, and I'd say,
"Take one!"

544
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:29,849
One, one.

545
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:32,018
And I'd have all the other
pharmacists flip the lights

546
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:33,853
on and off to make it...

547
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,388
And they'd put lighters up
to the sprinklers.

548
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:36,589
And we'd get
one of the fog machines

549
00:22:36,623 --> 00:22:37,724
left over
from our Halloween sale.

550
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:39,058
And pfft,

551
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:40,359
and it would fill the room.

552
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:42,395
And we'd have people
wafting it with car mats

553
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:45,097
just to make it go
in some sort of circle.

554
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:48,234
"Take one
on the seventh solstice

555
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,703
of the third
vernal equinox."

556
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:53,239
It's two different times a year,
but it's just a bit.

557
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:57,143
"Take one in the presence...

558
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:58,711
"Presence of a righteous man

559
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:00,112
"with the blood of a virgin.

560
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:01,514
"Also with crackers,

561
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:05,418
so you don't upset
your tummy."

562
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:07,420
I give it to you,
and as you are going to leave,

563
00:23:07,454 --> 00:23:08,521
you didn't even say anything.

564
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:09,956
I'd say, "Wait!"

565
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:12,391
I grab you...

566
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:14,661
Grab you with a grabbing hand.

567
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:16,395
What's a grabbing hand?
I'm gonna tell you.

568
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:17,797
You can't...
If you're gonna grab someone

569
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,499
and you want to instill fear
in their hearts,

570
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:21,200
you can't grab
with a well-manicured hand

571
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,068
with, like, a pretty ring.

572
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:23,670
No one's gonna be afraid.

573
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:24,971
If I grab you with this hand,
you'd be like, "What?"

574
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:26,272
That sounds awesome."

575
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:27,540
It's got to be creepy, okay?

576
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:29,308
Someone grabs you
out of a grave.

577
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:30,910
What does it look like?
it's sinewy.

578
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:32,712
It's got dirty nails.
it's all "thriller" -looking.

579
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:35,147
Just nah!
Gonna grab him.

580
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:36,182
How do you make a grabbing hand?

581
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:37,316
I'm going to tell you.

582
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,618
You put your hand
outside your car

583
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:40,453
for two hours a day,

584
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:44,190
so it tans quicker
than the rest of you.

585
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:46,158
You take special liver pills
that prevent your liver

586
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:47,560
from functioning on this side.

587
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:50,463
So you start to get liver spots
all over, okay?

588
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:51,764
Now, you gotta make
your fingers creepy.

589
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:53,466
So maybe...
So this finger...

590
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,101
You've got, like, a coke nail
on that finger.

591
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:57,737
This one's got, like... like,
a raccoon eyeball for a ring.

592
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,572
Maybe this...
You don't need this finger.

593
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:01,474
You cut this one off totally
'cause you lost it...

594
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:03,042
You lost it in the hobbit bore.

595
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:04,243
I don't care.

596
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,546
And then you get a bracelet

597
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:09,215
made of, like, whore gypsy
Kardashian hair.

598
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:11,250
You wrap your hand in it.

599
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,755
And just as you're...
I pull out my grabbing hand.

600
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,858
I have it sheathed.
it's sheathed in a sheath.

601
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,693
And, uh...

602
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:22,595
Just as you were leaving,
I'd go, "Wait!"

603
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:24,463
You'd be,
like, "What?"

604
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:28,334
And I'd say,
"There's one more thing."

605
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:29,969
And I'd pull out a hand
of magic dust,

606
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:33,573
which is just sand from the
beach aisle in the pharmacy.

607
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:35,508
I'd pull...
I'd pull out a hand of dust.

608
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:38,978
And I would just go...

609
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:43,182
"Do you have
a CVS card?"

610
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:57,597
I love walking
around pharmacies.

611
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,265
I love doing that.

612
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:00,633
I can't... I can't go to
a pharmacy and not spend money.

613
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,434
One of the products
that creeps me out...

614
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:04,036
They have a product
at every pharmacy

615
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,373
called "K-Y Intense."

616
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:09,275
You seen the commercials
for this thing?

617
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:10,577
The commercial for...
First of all,

618
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,279
the commercial for K-Y Intense
is super offensive.

619
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:14,346
And we will talk about that.

620
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,648
In the c...
First of all,

621
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:17,516
if you've ever used
K-Y Intense,

622
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,852
you know that it's intense
because it burns.

623
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,622
I will volunteer that.

624
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:24,223
I accidentally used it
one time thinking, like,

625
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:25,224
"this is gonna
be magical."

626
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:26,659
And it burned.

627
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:28,628
And I promise you
girls don't want that.

628
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:29,862
In my life,
I've never been, like,

629
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:31,664
"man, that sex was awesome.

630
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:33,465
"But you know what I wanted
to feel, like, right after?

631
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:37,269
Fire."

632
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:40,339
Of course, they don't bill it

633
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,408
as a burning sensation on TV.

634
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:43,475
They call it
"A tingling sensation."

635
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:46,412
And they try to, like, talk
to the girls.

636
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:47,546
They're like,
"Ladies, do you want

637
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,315
"more pleasure
out of your three minutes?

638
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:50,549
Do you want that?
Okay."

639
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:53,720
"Well, K-Y Intense
is great

640
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:55,521
"'cause it's a tingling
sensation for her

641
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,089
"and he gets to use his penis.

642
00:25:57,123 --> 00:26:00,593
So everybody wins."

643
00:26:00,627 --> 00:26:02,662
But even if it...
Even if it was

644
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:04,764
a tingling sensation,
we live in a society

645
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:07,166
preconditioned to not
want tingling.

646
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,735
We don't like tingling.

647
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,870
We know that tingling, it means
a bad thing is happening.

648
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,339
"Hey, everyone, grandma says
her arm is tingling."

649
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:15,174
"Oh, she must be having
an orgasm."

650
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:20,279
"You don't have to rush her
to the hospital.

651
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:21,580
"She's laying on the ground

652
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:22,715
"with her eyes rolled back
in her head.

653
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:25,652
She's clearly
enjoying herself."

654
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:28,554
Tingling.
it's horrible.

655
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,588
You ever hit your funny bone
and been, like...

656
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:30,990
"Ahh."

657
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:36,562
The commercial is awful
because it's two British people.

658
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,931
And they're sitting there
having breakfast.

659
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:40,399
And they're discussing
all the sex

660
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,969
that they had
the night before...

661
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,838
'Cause they used
the K-Y Intense.

662
00:26:45,872 --> 00:26:48,040
But because the Brits are very
tacit about sexual things,

663
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:50,242
they're not coming right out
and discussing it.

664
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:51,377
They're speaking in code.

665
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,444
And at the bottom of the screen

666
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:55,547
are the subtitles in American

667
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:56,949
so we can understand
what they're saying.

668
00:26:56,983 --> 00:26:58,484
So they're sitting there,
and they're eating.

669
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:01,020
They're having
their... porridge.

670
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:04,991
They're eating
their curds and whey.

671
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:08,094
I don't care what the Brits eat.
We won the war, so there.

672
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,396
Right?

673
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:12,131
So they're sitting there.
And they're eating it.

674
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:15,367
And it's just very quiet.
And they're just...

675
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:29,648
Teeth out to here.

676
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:39,859
And the girl looks at the guy.

677
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:42,428
"Wonderful dessert
last night, sire."

678
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:45,597
She didn't say "sire."

679
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:46,799
They don't talk
like that anymore.

680
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:50,569
So she talks,
and there's subtitles.

681
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:52,171
"Wonderful dessert
last night."

682
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:54,340
"Hey! What'd you put
on my puss, nigga?"

683
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:58,310
And then the guy...

684
00:27:58,344 --> 00:27:59,779
Responds in kind.

685
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:01,513
He's like, "Oh, yes, 'twas..."

686
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:02,481
"'Twas a bit of a new recipe.

687
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,916
Hoped you liked it."

688
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,885
"Put some of that K-Y shit
on my dick, bitch.

689
00:28:05,918 --> 00:28:07,854
How you like me now?"

690
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,192
And then, the girl is,
like, "Oh, yes."

691
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:15,561
'Twas quite invigorating.
Didn't expect that one."

692
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:16,963
"You fucking kidding me
with that shit?

693
00:28:16,996 --> 00:28:18,731
"What'd you put?
Ants on your dick?

694
00:28:18,765 --> 00:28:20,632
Is this a joke?"

695
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:22,068
"You want
to fucking die, motherfucker?

696
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:24,403
"You want to end up on snap?
I'll fucking kill you.

697
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:25,471
This fuckin' hurt."

698
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:28,908
Then the guy, like, "Oh, yes",

699
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:30,442
"tried a spin on an old recipe.

700
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:32,144
Tried a dash
of nutmeg."

701
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:34,947
And there were
no subtitles for that

702
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:36,749
because I think
they fucking do use nutmeg.

703
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:38,384
And that's what makes it
burn so much.

704
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,458
I know a lot about sex
and dating.

705
00:28:46,492 --> 00:28:47,393
I know a lot about dating

706
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:49,361
because I watch a lot of dates.

707
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,731
That sounds creepy.
I host a dating show.

708
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:54,400
So I've learned a lot
about men and women

709
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:55,835
and their interactions.

710
00:28:55,868 --> 00:28:57,904
And one important thing
that I've learned

711
00:28:57,937 --> 00:29:01,340
is that when you like someone
and you want to impress them,

712
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:02,708
what do you do?

713
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,743
You lie.

714
00:29:04,777 --> 00:29:06,913
You have to,
because if people knew

715
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:08,414
how weird you were
in your off time,

716
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:10,950
no one would have you.

717
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:12,785
A guy says to you, "What do
you like to do for fun?"

718
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:14,586
Girls, you can't be honest.

719
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,923
You can't be honest
about that shit.

720
00:29:16,956 --> 00:29:18,690
You can't be honest
about what you were doing

721
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:20,692
10 minutes before you came
to the door.

722
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:21,828
You have to lie.

723
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:23,329
"What do you like
to do for fun?"

724
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:24,363
You can't tell him.

725
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:25,764
You can't be, like,
"I really enjoy

726
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:27,466
"choreographing naked
cheerleading routines

727
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:28,835
"to old Britney Spears CDs.

728
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:30,870
"And then, I Google
a bunch of Hentai porn,

729
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:32,504
"masturbate, don't wash
my hands,

730
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:34,140
"Facebook stalk my ex-boyfriend
and his ex-girlfriends,

731
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:35,875
"jot down their place of
employment for future reference.

732
00:29:35,908 --> 00:29:37,643
"And then, I go
bake some cookies.

733
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:39,011
"And then,
I mouth-kiss my dog

734
00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:40,412
and promise her that one day
she'll be my wife."

735
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:42,815
You can't say that.

736
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:44,917
Nine times out of ten,
a guy asks a girl,

737
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:46,685
"What do you like to do
for fun?"

738
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:49,088
The girl's answer
will be, "Hiking."

739
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:55,761
"I love hiking.
I do.

740
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,429
I do... don't I?
I do. I love hiking."

741
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:00,199
"I do, hiking's..."

742
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:01,233
"I love hiking."

743
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:05,604
"I do. I love it.
I love hiking."

744
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,106
"No, you don't.
Stop lying.

745
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,041
"You don't like... really, Stacy?
You like hiking?

746
00:30:09,075 --> 00:30:11,677
"Where are your trail spikes?
Where's your walking stick?

747
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,812
Where's your lesbian
mountain partner?"

748
00:30:15,381 --> 00:30:16,415
You don't like hiking.

749
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:18,050
You don't even know
what hiking is.

750
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:20,786
Most modern girls don't really
know what hiking is, okay?

751
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,688
To the average girl, hiking is

752
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:23,822
you wake up whenever you want,

753
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:25,457
you put on Lululemon yoga pants

754
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:27,826
'cause they make your butt
look unreasonably good

755
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,863
as they should
for 800 fucking dollars.

756
00:30:30,897 --> 00:30:32,764
And you go for a walk
in the park

757
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:33,665
with your best friend
and complain

758
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:35,034
about how hung over you are.

759
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:39,505
That's hiking.

760
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:41,908
Yeah.
I do it too.

761
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:43,309
Promise you this, girls.

762
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,144
It's not a sport
if you can drink a Starbucks

763
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,613
and have a pita
while you're doing it.

764
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:48,714
"Do you want
a piece of pita?"

765
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:50,983
"I'm hiking."

766
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:52,751
But there's a method
to our madness.

767
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:54,786
There's a reason women
say "hiking."

768
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:58,024
We say hiking because we think
guys like hiking.

769
00:30:58,057 --> 00:30:59,291
That's why we're doing it.

770
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:00,526
Be outside where the bugs are?

771
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,294
No!
we think you like that.

772
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:04,796
We're taught to believe
that men are outdoorsy,

773
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,765
and rugged,
and they like nature.

774
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,500
As far as we're concerned,

775
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:12,238
you're the closest thing
we know to a bear.

776
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:15,741
So we say hiking, hoping to have

777
00:31:15,774 --> 00:31:16,608
something in common with you.

778
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:18,044
We honestly say "hiking"

779
00:31:18,077 --> 00:31:19,946
hoping that you'll be,
like, "you like hiking?"

780
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:25,051
I like hiking.
Marry me."

781
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:26,885
It's the easiest thing
you can say that you do.

782
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:28,687
It's one of the only
outdoor activities

783
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,722
that you can lie
and say that you do it

784
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:32,524
having never done it before,

785
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:36,828
and then do it and pull it off
because it's walking.

786
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:38,730
You can't pull that off,

787
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:41,200
you shouldn't be mating
with anyone.

788
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:42,634
You ca...
Most outdoor activities

789
00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:44,370
require a decent amount
of skill.

790
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:47,039
For example, you can't say
you like rock climbing

791
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:49,008
if you've never been
rock climbing.

792
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:51,877
I mean, you can,
but I promise you this.

793
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,247
You're gonna go.
You're gonna slip.

794
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:58,017
You're gonna get your hand
caught in a rock.

795
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:01,687
127 hours later...

796
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,460
Stump's not getting you
a second date.

797
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:10,262
I promise you that.

798
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:11,930
I don't know if girls
wanna hear this,

799
00:32:11,964 --> 00:32:14,066
but the truth is
90% of the activities

800
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,434
that women engage in

801
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:18,004
revolve around getting
a guy's attention, okay?

802
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:19,938
And it's just the way
we're built biologically.

803
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:21,707
This is just something we do.

804
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,009
We love to get your attention.

805
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:24,843
it's part of the sport of it,
all right?

806
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,145
You think I go to a sports bar

807
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:27,846
because I like warm beer
and sticky barstools?

808
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,481
No. I go 'cause there's
guys there.

809
00:32:29,515 --> 00:32:30,849
You think I do a pub crawl
every year

810
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,184
'cause I like it
when my liver hurts?

811
00:32:32,218 --> 00:32:33,919
No! I go 'cause there's
guys there.

812
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,054
We don't wear heels
for our circulation.

813
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:36,555
We do it to prop up our butt

814
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:38,524
so you'll look at me
and want to mate with me.

815
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:39,925
That's why we do it.

816
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,260
This isn't a fucking game,
all right?

817
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,961
This isn't a push-up bra.
it's body armor.

818
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:44,263
And this ain't
makeup, sweetheart.

819
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,498
it's war paint.
Let's make a baby.

820
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:58,410
Girls know exactly
what they're doing.

821
00:32:58,444 --> 00:33:00,179
We know exactly what you like,
what you don't like.

822
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:01,947
We do our research
when we like a guy.

823
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,416
And by research,
I mean we Facebook stalk you.

824
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,318
We do it.

825
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:07,719
I know your favorite foods.

826
00:33:07,753 --> 00:33:08,954
I know
where you went on vacation.

827
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,989
I know that your favorite team
is the Cowboys.

828
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:12,791
I know all about that.
I'm totally into you.

829
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,093
That's right.

830
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:16,028
They say men are hunters
and women are gatherers.

831
00:33:16,062 --> 00:33:18,064
Well, kind of.
Women are gatherers.

832
00:33:18,097 --> 00:33:19,798
We like to gather information
about you.

833
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,401
And then we hunt you.

834
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:24,970
You think when I bring you home
to meet mom on Christmas

835
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,372
it's 'cause I want her
to meet you?

836
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:29,241
No, it's so I can be, like,
"Mom, look what I caught."

837
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:33,812
We have to, because guys
are kind of passive

838
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,314
when it comes to meeting women.

839
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,216
Sure, they go out.
But girls make a sport of it.

840
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:39,017
My guy friends don't care.

841
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:40,086
If they had their way,
they'd spend

842
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:42,020
every saturday night
with each other...

843
00:33:42,054 --> 00:33:44,190
Which is weird...
Watching "1000 ways to die,"

844
00:33:44,223 --> 00:33:45,991
eating sandwiches,
ragging on their one friend

845
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,326
that has a huge nut sack
for no reason.

846
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,895
Like, that's what they would do.

847
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:52,298
Going out's very important.

848
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:54,200
You got a real job, your weekend
is very important to you,

849
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:56,168
because a weekend represents
48 hours

850
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:58,937
that you have
to fuck up the life

851
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,207
that you worked so hard for
all week.

852
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:07,146
That's what your weekend is.

853
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:08,780
If you're a real professional,

854
00:34:08,814 --> 00:34:12,184
your weekend starts thursday
at, like, 5:00 P.M.

855
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:14,052
Right?
you go to happy hour.

856
00:34:14,086 --> 00:34:15,053
Happy hour trickles
into, like, nighttime.

857
00:34:15,087 --> 00:34:16,655
You're drinking a little bit

858
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:19,057
'cause you can go to work
a little hung over, right?

859
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:20,892
No one's doing real work
on friday.

860
00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:23,129
Nobody's working on a friday.

861
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:24,563
Nobody's working on a friday
'cause it's what?

862
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:25,997
Shabbat. No.

863
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:28,467
Because it's friday
and nobody cares.

864
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,602
You ever been at work, your boss
is never gonna be, like,

865
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:33,172
"Let's get in those reports
and start brainstorming."

866
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:34,473
You're, like,
"Okay, I'll be there."

867
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:38,977
"Oh, you were serious?
Okay, little hand job.

868
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:39,745
I'll be at my desk.
That's fine."

869
00:34:43,048 --> 00:34:44,616
Girls take going out
very seriously

870
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,785
'cause that's
our hunting grounds.

871
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,420
"Going out.
Let's do it."

872
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,858
"Do you want to do,
like, a girls' night?

873
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:55,227
Do you wanna
do that?"

874
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:56,928
Every weekend, I get calls
from my girlfriends.

875
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:58,430
"Do you want to do,
like, just girls?

876
00:34:58,464 --> 00:35:00,966
"Do you want to do,
like, a fun girls' night?

877
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:02,067
Iliza, I'm talking to you.
Iliza."

878
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,569
"Do you want to do that?"

879
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,569
"DO YOU WANT TO DO THAT?"

880
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:05,937
"Do you wanna do,

881
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:07,206
"like, a girls'...
We'll just do...

882
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,407
"Oh, we'll all wear,
like, fun shoes.

883
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,276
"And we'll all get, like, Apis.

884
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:11,343
And then, we'll do,
like, a fun girls' night."

885
00:35:11,377 --> 00:35:12,511
"Do you wanna do that?

886
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:13,912
"I wanna do a girls' night.

887
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,481
I made an evite
for the four of us."

888
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,318
"You didn't answer."

889
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:20,819
"'Cause I'm standing
right here."

890
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:23,389
"You're such a bitch."

891
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:24,456
"Let's do a girls' night.
Let's do just girls.

892
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:26,091
"No boys.

893
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,627
Let's just all wear wedges
and no boys."

894
00:35:30,496 --> 00:35:32,731
"Let's not do boys, just girls.
Just the girls."

895
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:34,733
I'm like, "Why?"

896
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:37,769
We hate each other."

897
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,205
Girls hate each other.

898
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:41,473
Esp... she hates you,
especially during the day.

899
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:45,977
But when the moon comes up
and there's white wine involved,

900
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:49,681
"Oh, my God.
Stacy, you look amazing.

901
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:52,218
I fucking love you."

902
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:53,619
And you notice
the drunker you get,

903
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,954
the more Spanish
you start speaking?

904
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,757
"Oh, my God.
Mamacita, muy caliente.

905
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,926
Whoo!"

906
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:05,096
"Fucking love you, chica."

907
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,565
But the more love you give
to one girlfriend,

908
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:10,302
the more love you must taketh
away from another girlfriend.

909
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:12,238
It's how we keep balance
in the girl universe.

910
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:14,973
"I love you.
Can I just tell you?"

911
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,376
"I love you, I do."

912
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:18,777
"But you know who I hate?"

913
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:23,915
"Becky."

914
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:26,252
"She's a bitch."

915
00:36:26,285 --> 00:36:29,154
"No, I hate her
even though she drove me here

916
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,590
and I'm wearing
her top."

917
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:36,061
"Can I just tell you that?

918
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:37,195
"Like, for real,
like, I hate her.

919
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:39,298
"Will you not tell her?
Do you promise?

920
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:41,300
"Do you... do you prom...
You won't tell her?

921
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:42,534
"Do you pinky swear?

922
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:44,102
"Do you pinky s...
Do you pinky swear?

923
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:45,170
"Even though
I'm a grown fucking woman

924
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,605
"that pays taxes and votes,

925
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:50,075
do you wanna pinky swear?"

926
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:51,777
"This is ironclad.
Do you pinky swear?

927
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,279
"Okay, come here.
No, here, take my hand.

928
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:56,315
"I wanna talk to you.
Come here.

929
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:58,550
"No, like, earlier, like...
Here, come here, come here.

930
00:36:58,584 --> 00:37:00,519
"Like, earlier, she was just,
like, being, like, a bitch.

931
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,120
"And I was, like,
'What's your problem?

932
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:04,556
I don't even understand.'"

933
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,024
"Now, she's like, 'Why
are you being, like, so rude?"

934
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,660
'And, like... what, are you, like,
bipolar or, like, manic?

935
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:10,896
'Like I just freely use
these psychological terms

936
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:12,364
'cause I don't know
what I'm talking about.'

937
00:37:12,398 --> 00:37:14,666
"and she was, like, being,
like... wait, wait."

938
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,668
"Is she looking?"

939
00:37:16,702 --> 00:37:18,504
"Did she hear me talking
about her?"

940
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:20,739
"Is she... pretend like we're
not talking about her."

941
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:24,209
"Is she gone?"

942
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,544
"No, but,
like, that's the thing."

943
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,346
"Like, earlier, she was just,
like, being,"

944
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:30,982
"like, passive-aggressive
and, like, crazy."

945
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:32,784
"And, like..."

946
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:34,486
"And I was just, like..."

947
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,221
"She was just being,
like, a freak."

948
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,723
"And she was just,
like, disrespecting me."

949
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:41,793
"And, like... no, no, like,
when you do it, it's fine."

950
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:46,632
"Right?

951
00:37:46,665 --> 00:37:50,369
Because we get each other
'cause we're both pisces."

952
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:52,137
Which means nothing.

953
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,872
"Do you wanna do that?

954
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:55,240
"Do you wanna do a girls night?

955
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,608
"Fuck yeah.
Why don't you come over?

956
00:37:56,642 --> 00:37:58,477
"'US Weekly',
Jennifer Aniston, hang out,

957
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,078
"Love actually, '
watch a movie, braid our hair,

958
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,413
stiff as a board, "Light
as a feather, have some candy",

959
00:38:01,447 --> 00:38:03,349
"have some cake,
have some cookies,

"have some box wine,
have some fucking Martinis,

"Sounds great, Cindy.

964
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:11,289
"Can't wait to be shit-faced

965
00:38:11,323 --> 00:38:12,924
"at 2:00 A.M. with no boy
to make out with."

966
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,394
"You got 'Grey's Anatomy'
on DVD? Awesome."

967
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:18,397
"Pop it in. Let's lez out.
Where's your brother?"

968
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:29,274
Yeah.
let's make that happen.

969
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,142
Tired of feeling
like a sexual deviant

970
00:38:31,176 --> 00:38:32,411
'cause I just enjoy a little bit

971
00:38:32,444 --> 00:38:35,547
of mouth-kissing
with my red wine, okay?

972
00:38:35,581 --> 00:38:37,349
Look, that's what most girls
want, by the way.

973
00:38:37,383 --> 00:38:39,284
We just wanna make out,
just a little bit.

974
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,185
Right at the beginning
when you first meet,

975
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:41,319
they want to make out.

976
00:38:41,353 --> 00:38:42,354
That's what most girls want.

977
00:38:42,388 --> 00:38:43,789
"I wanna do some fun shoes,

978
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:46,024
red wine, make out,
weiner touch, go to bed."

979
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:48,059
That's what we want...

980
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:49,127
When you first meet someone.

981
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,328
Look, let's not
get crazy, right?

982
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:52,163
Just make out, and...

983
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:55,100
And then that's it.

984
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:57,135
Just real quick, in that order.

985
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,236
You don't want
to have drunk sex.

986
00:38:58,269 --> 00:38:59,905
That's a whole mess.

987
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:02,374
Drunk sex, there's emotions,
ankle sprains, paper work.

988
00:39:02,408 --> 00:39:06,545
There's, like,
a whole thing involved.

989
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:08,346
Girls like making out.

990
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,148
It's a sentiment
echoed by almost any girl

991
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,717
in any bar on any night.

992
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,385
You pick any bar in the country.

993
00:39:13,419 --> 00:39:14,986
You find a girl,
she's gonna be drunk,

994
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,054
face on sideways, just, like...

995
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:22,127
"I just want to make out
with a boy.

996
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,429
"I just want to make out
with a boy.

997
00:39:23,462 --> 00:39:26,197
"I do, I just want to make out
with some boy.

998
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:28,500
That's all I want."

999
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:30,168
"I do.
I'm pretty, right?"

1000
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:36,374
"I just want..."

1001
00:39:41,246 --> 00:39:45,951
"Saved it."

1002
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:47,185
That's what you hear.

1003
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,420
You rarely hear a girl talk

1004
00:39:48,454 --> 00:39:50,155
about having sex
with a stranger.

1005
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:51,823
I understand it happens.

1006
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:53,191
I understand
that there's one-night stands.

1007
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,626
But rarely does a girl go out

1008
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,195
with the intention of having sex
with a stranger.

1009
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,464
Rarely do you hear a girl, like,

1010
00:39:58,497 --> 00:40:01,600
"I just want to, like, go out,
and, like, party,

1011
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:02,901
"and, like, meet some dude,
and go home with him,

1012
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:04,235
"and then have sex with him,
and then wake up,

1013
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:05,571
"and realize
I never got his name.

1014
00:40:05,604 --> 00:40:06,972
"But he's already gone
to the gym.

1015
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:08,139
"So I can't ask him.

1016
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:09,340
"So I go over
to his coffee table,

1017
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:10,542
"and I find a phone bill
with his name on it.

1018
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:11,910
"And I put it in my pocket,

1019
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:12,878
and I go home
with the phone bill."

1020
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:16,515
"And I get home to my computer,
and I take it out."

1021
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:18,617
"I'm like, 'Brian Williamson.
That's a generic fucking name.'"

1022
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,452
"So I look up all 90,000
Brian Williamsons on Facebook"

1023
00:40:20,486 --> 00:40:21,687
"until I find the one
that resembles him."

1024
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,088
"And then,
I send him a message."

1025
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:24,690
"But I have to use bait"

1026
00:40:24,723 --> 00:40:26,224
"'cause I have to make sure
he'll write me back."

1027
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,793
"So I'm like,
'I think I'm pregnant.'"

1028
00:40:27,826 --> 00:40:30,095
"he writes back.
'J-K, mother fucker.'"

1029
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:32,297
'but I got you now.'

1030
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:34,700
"now, we begin
the dance of seduction."

1031
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:36,468
"Now, I say things,
like, 'I just wanna be friends."

1032
00:40:36,502 --> 00:40:38,436
'You were super fun
to have sex with.

1033
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,571
'Let's just be friends
and have sex.

1034
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:41,172
'Fuck a relationship
and oxytocin.

1035
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:42,407
'I never wanna have a family.

1036
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,842
Let's just do
what you wanna do.'

1037
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:46,478
he's into it.
So I get your number, right?

1038
00:40:46,512 --> 00:40:48,514
You hold onto the number
until you have an occasion.

1039
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:50,115
And then,
it's like St. Patrick's day.

1040
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:52,984
You send out a mass text,
but it's just to one person.

1041
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:54,653
You ever do that?

1042
00:40:54,686 --> 00:41:00,058
Me neither.
It was just a joke.

1043
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:01,159
It's the best idea.

1044
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:02,894
You find one guy that you like.

1045
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:04,596
And you send out a text
that's, like, "Hey, everyone."

1046
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,698
Make sure you write
"everyone" in caps

1047
00:41:06,732 --> 00:41:08,399
so it's clear that it's
for, like, a bunch of people.

1048
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:10,435
"Hey, everyone, L-O-L."

1049
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,171
"Whatever, smiley face,
I'm gonna have a party

1050
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:14,573
"at Kelly's bar
at 9:00 P.M.

1051
00:41:14,606 --> 00:41:16,374
Everybody should come,
you guys."

1052
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:17,709
Triple "z" so he knows

1053
00:41:17,743 --> 00:41:19,144
there's a lot of people
in this text.

1054
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:20,278
"Okay, see you later."

1055
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,613
And then you bring
your one friend

1056
00:41:21,647 --> 00:41:23,281
that has no issue
with you ditching her.

1057
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,282
You go to the bar,
and you post up,

1058
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,483
and you wait
until he gets there.

1059
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:26,785
He shows up.

1060
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,419
You're like,
"I guess everybody passed out.

1061
00:41:28,453 --> 00:41:30,121
It's just us standing."

1062
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:31,623
And then, you make out.

1063
00:41:31,657 --> 00:41:32,824
And he's, like,
"You seem like a cool chick."

1064
00:41:32,858 --> 00:41:34,092
You're, like,
"I'm the coolest chick.

1065
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:35,527
I wanna fucking
do it."

1066
00:41:35,561 --> 00:41:37,295
And he's, like, "Let's go out
tomorrow night."

1067
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,329
You're like,
"Yeah, a second date.

1068
00:41:38,363 --> 00:41:39,464
"It only took me
six fucking months.

1069
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,166
Yeah."

1070
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,301
So now, you're excited
'cause you have a second date.

1071
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,502
And girls love getting ready
for dates.

1072
00:41:44,536 --> 00:41:45,904
Even though it makes us
a little nauseous

1073
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:47,005
and all we wanna do
is stay home and eat,

1074
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:48,640
we love second dates

1075
00:41:48,674 --> 00:41:50,008
'cause you got to get ready
for your second date.

1076
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,342
So what do you do?

1077
00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:52,678
You do your hair,
you do your makeup,

1078
00:41:52,711 --> 00:41:55,614
you shave your big toe.

1079
00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:00,586
You come to play, right?

1080
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:01,753
Gotta make sure
your underwear's cute.

1081
00:42:01,787 --> 00:42:03,689
Don't wanna go
to Victoria's Secret

1082
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:05,090
'cause that's a bit too much
of a commitment.

1083
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:08,259
So where do you go for a cheap
bra that's really cute?

1084
00:42:08,293 --> 00:42:11,529
Target.

1085
00:42:11,563 --> 00:42:12,698
They don't fit,
and you're like, "Fuck it."

1086
00:42:12,731 --> 00:42:14,432
"For $12.50,
I'll wear a bra

1087
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:16,101
"made of ceiling insulation
and barbed wire.

1088
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:18,203
That's fine."

1089
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:19,504
"It doesn't fit this boob,

1090
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,772
"and it makes this nipple
fall asleep.

1091
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:23,842
But for 12 bucks,
I'm good."

1092
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,944
You get all excited.
You put on makeup.

1093
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:28,046
You put on the makeup that
you're okay with sleeping in.

1094
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,881
All girls have
to make this decision

1095
00:42:29,915 --> 00:42:31,549
'cause you know you're not
gonna be washing your face

1096
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,619
because girls are so fucked up
that we think,

1097
00:42:33,652 --> 00:42:35,486
"I'd rather fall asleep,
get night zits,

1098
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,857
"and wake up looking
like a melted clown

1099
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,526
than ever wash my face and show
him that I'm a human being."

1100
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,428
So you go there.
You're all excited.

1101
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:44,763
You get to his house.
You guys start drinking.

1102
00:42:44,796 --> 00:42:47,532
You get so fucking wasted
in the first two hours

1103
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,566
that you have sex
for three minutes

1104
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,701
before he goes completely soft.

1105
00:42:49,735 --> 00:42:51,502
And the next thing you know,

1106
00:42:51,536 --> 00:42:52,971
you wake up in your underwear
on his couch.

1107
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:54,272
You look over,
he's eating noodles,

1108
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:55,473
watching "Harry Potter."

1109
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:57,943
Is this relatable
to anyone else?

1110
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:02,681
Popular misconception
about girls

1111
00:43:02,714 --> 00:43:05,116
is that we get drunk
and we wanna have sex.

1112
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,551
Here's the truth.

1113
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,854
We do.
Have a good night.

1114
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:11,322
No.

1115
00:43:11,356 --> 00:43:14,693
We do for, like, the first hour
of being drunk, okay?

1116
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:17,162
Let's talk about the first hour
of being drunk

1117
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:21,499
mostly because many of you
are in that hour right now.

1118
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:24,369
I call it
"the witching hour."

1119
00:43:24,402 --> 00:43:25,470
The first hour of being drunk

1120
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:27,739
is the best hour of the night

1121
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:30,541
because your buzz is fresh.

1122
00:43:30,575 --> 00:43:33,144
You're happy.
You don't feel fat.

1123
00:43:33,178 --> 00:43:36,614
You haven't cried yet.

1124
00:43:36,648 --> 00:43:38,149
You're still somewhat
of the self you were

1125
00:43:38,183 --> 00:43:39,350
when you were sober.

1126
00:43:39,384 --> 00:43:41,787
You still could ostensibly
operate heavy machinery

1127
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:44,656
if an emergency
were to arise, okay?

1128
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:46,725
You're in that buzz.
You're feeling awesome.

1129
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:48,827
Your synapses haven't been
soaked in alcohol.

1130
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,628
So you're still alert.
You're feeling awesome.

1131
00:43:50,662 --> 00:43:52,230
You walk into that bar
like you own it.

1132
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:54,666
You fucking kick that door open
even though it's a pull-in door.

1133
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,234
You don't care.
You're just...

1134
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:57,769
Walk in.

1135
00:43:57,803 --> 00:44:01,873
"Let's do shots, bitches."

1136
00:44:01,907 --> 00:44:03,241
You and your awful friends
line up at the bar.

1137
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:04,776
Like, "Let's do shots."

1138
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:06,778
You're doing shots
you have no business doing.

1139
00:44:06,812 --> 00:44:09,748
"Let's get Jagermeister,
Goldschlager,

1140
00:44:09,781 --> 00:44:11,482
"Rumple Minze, aftershock.

1141
00:44:11,516 --> 00:44:12,784
"Do you have anything else

1142
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:15,220
that tastes like Christmas
and vomit?"

1143
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:21,960
You start doing them.
You're like, "Fuck it."

1144
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:23,795
"it's my Bachelorette,
21st birthday,"

1145
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:25,964
"wedding extravaganza,
donkey punch."

1146
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:27,498
"I don't know what this is...
Do it."

1147
00:44:27,532 --> 00:44:29,267
Shot, shot.

1148
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,503
"What is that, hand soap?
Bubbles. I don't care. Awesome."

1149
00:44:32,537 --> 00:44:33,638
Now, you're on the dance floor.

1150
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,473
You're like,
"This is so good."

1151
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,308
And you're feeling so good,
right? You're dancing.

1152
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:39,010
You're all excited 'cause
your buzz has just hit you.

1153
00:44:39,044 --> 00:44:40,378
You're like, "this is great.
I fucking love it."

1154
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:41,880
You're ambitious about life.

1155
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:45,050
You ever plan a workout
when you're drunk?

1156
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:47,919
When you're drunk, you're, like,
"This is when I get in shape.

1157
00:44:47,953 --> 00:44:49,420
"This is where it starts.

1158
00:44:49,454 --> 00:44:50,621
Going to start tomorrow."

1159
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:51,622
You try to drag your friends
into it.

1160
00:44:51,656 --> 00:44:53,859
You're like,
"Stacy! Sta..."

1161
00:44:53,892 --> 00:44:55,226
"Stacy."

1162
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:58,629
"Do you wanna work out?"

1163
00:44:58,663 --> 00:44:59,798
You dance like an asshole,
by the way.

1164
00:44:59,831 --> 00:45:01,699
I don't know
who dances like this.

1165
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:03,434
"Do you wanna work out,
like, tomorrow?

1166
00:45:03,468 --> 00:45:04,569
"Do you wanna do that?

1167
00:45:04,602 --> 00:45:05,570
"I'm gonna get up early
and work out.

1168
00:45:05,603 --> 00:45:06,704
"Do you wanna go with me?

1169
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:08,206
"Do you want to go
at, like, 6:00?

1170
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:12,443
It's 5:00 now."

1171
00:45:12,477 --> 00:45:14,212
"Do you wanna take
a spin class?"

1172
00:45:14,245 --> 00:45:15,513
"Do you wanna spin?"

1173
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,682
"Do you wanna..."

1174
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,950
"Do you want...
You don't wanna spin?

1175
00:45:18,984 --> 00:45:20,752
"You don't wanna go spinning?

1176
00:45:20,786 --> 00:45:22,187
"You don't wanna sit
on a stationary bike

1177
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,756
"and tolerate getting pounded
in the rectum for an hour

1178
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:27,225
"while some twinked-out
spandex queen yells at you

1179
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:29,427
"over a shitty remix of U2's
'It's a Beautiful Day'

1180
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,229
in total darkness?"

1181
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,099
"You don't
wanna do that?"

1182
00:45:34,132 --> 00:45:35,867
So you're feeling good
and you're dancing.

1183
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:37,535
You're like, "I feel so thin."

1184
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,669
"I've never been hotter
in my life.

1185
00:45:38,703 --> 00:45:40,371
I feel so good."
And then, it hits you.

1186
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:43,741
You're like, "oh, my God.
I feel so good right now."

1187
00:45:43,775 --> 00:45:45,977
"I feel so awesome and happy.

1188
00:45:46,011 --> 00:45:48,079
"I wish I could feel this way
all the time.

1189
00:45:48,113 --> 00:45:51,449
I wish I could feel this buzz
and this happy all the time."

1190
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:53,919
And that's when you realize

1191
00:45:53,952 --> 00:45:58,056
that's how an alcoholic thinks.

1192
00:45:58,089 --> 00:45:59,958
But you're, like, "Screw it.
I'm gonna give it a shot."

1193
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:03,128
I'm gonna see just how far
I can push being drunk."

1194
00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:04,595
So you decide to do shots.

1195
00:46:04,629 --> 00:46:06,898
And you decide,
"These shots aren't gonna get me

1196
00:46:06,932 --> 00:46:11,269
'cause tonight's the night
I outsmart the liquor."

1197
00:46:11,302 --> 00:46:14,772
"Not gonna happen tonight
'cause I'm gonna drink water.

1198
00:46:14,806 --> 00:46:16,607
Going to drink a glass of water
with each shot."

1199
00:46:16,641 --> 00:46:18,109
And this is your brilliant idea.

1200
00:46:18,143 --> 00:46:21,512
No one in the thousands of years
of people imbibing alcohol

1201
00:46:21,546 --> 00:46:22,613
has ever thought of this.

1202
00:46:22,647 --> 00:46:24,449
This is your night, Einstein.

1203
00:46:24,482 --> 00:46:26,184
It's your big plan.

1204
00:46:26,217 --> 00:46:28,719
"I'm gonna do a shot
and then have a glass of water,

1205
00:46:28,753 --> 00:46:30,221
"and then a shot,
and then a glass of water.

1206
00:46:30,255 --> 00:46:32,190
"You can't buy me a shot now,
but thank you.

1207
00:46:32,223 --> 00:46:33,959
I'm just having water."

1208
00:46:33,992 --> 00:46:35,693
"I'm just having..."

1209
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:37,762
"I'm just drinking water,
but thank you."

1210
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,764
Shot and water,
but what you don't realize

1211
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,132
is that five shots in an hour

1212
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:45,036
is still five fucking shots
in an hour.

1213
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:47,873
You went and drank all
that water like a crazy camel.

1214
00:46:47,906 --> 00:46:49,507
Yeah, good job.
Now, you're bloated.

1215
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,676
And you have to pee.
Way to be.

1216
00:46:51,709 --> 00:46:52,878
'Cause when a girl's gotta pee,

1217
00:46:52,911 --> 00:46:54,913
everything has to come
to a halt.

1218
00:46:54,946 --> 00:46:56,114
Every girl's gotta go with her.

1219
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:58,516
"I have to pee.
Do you have to pee?"

1220
00:47:01,586 --> 00:47:05,256
"I can't go alone.
No."

1221
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:06,925
"Will you stop what you're doing
and come with me?"

1222
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:08,693
"I have to pee.
Do you have to pee?"

1223
00:47:08,726 --> 00:47:11,062
"I have to pee.
I have to go pee."

1224
00:47:16,902 --> 00:47:19,004
Can't go in the bathroom alone.

1225
00:47:19,037 --> 00:47:21,772
You might not come back.

1226
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:23,108
'Cause no girl's ever been

1227
00:47:23,141 --> 00:47:26,377
to the bathroom alone
and survived.

1228
00:47:26,411 --> 00:47:27,913
it's true.

1229
00:47:27,946 --> 00:47:30,281
The last woman
that attempted it,

1230
00:47:30,315 --> 00:47:32,650
it was 1937...

1231
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:36,021
And her name was Amelia Earhart.

1232
00:47:42,827 --> 00:47:44,662
It's a big event.

1233
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,164
"I have to pee.
Come on. Let's go.

1234
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:47,665
"Every girl, let's go,
you girls.

1235
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,000
"Come on.
I have to pee, come on.

1236
00:47:49,034 --> 00:47:50,401
"Take my hand.
Let's make a chain of whores.

1237
00:47:50,435 --> 00:47:51,736
Everyone holds hands."

1238
00:47:51,769 --> 00:47:53,271
As they walk into the bathroom.

1239
00:47:53,304 --> 00:47:55,907
For me, when I'm walking
through a crowded bar,

1240
00:47:55,941 --> 00:47:58,309
the amount of aggression
I will display

1241
00:47:58,343 --> 00:48:01,312
toward the other bar patrons
is in direct correlation

1242
00:48:01,346 --> 00:48:03,548
with how many boys
I've gotten to flirt with.

1243
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:06,851
Meaning if I haven't gotten
to talk to any cute guys,

1244
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,619
mama's gonna be
a little aggressive

1245
00:48:08,653 --> 00:48:10,355
in her walk
to the bathroom, okay?

1246
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:12,457
Guys, when they get drunk,
sometimes punch walls.

1247
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:13,891
I like to mule kick other girls
in the shin.

1248
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:15,393
It's totally fine.

1249
00:48:15,426 --> 00:48:16,827
Every girl's done this.
And you know why we do it?

1250
00:48:16,861 --> 00:48:18,329
'Cause we can get away with it.

1251
00:48:18,363 --> 00:48:20,065
You can knock into a girl
and then be, like, "Oops."

1252
00:48:20,098 --> 00:48:21,566
I didn't mean that."

1253
00:48:23,801 --> 00:48:25,336
Our smile
is our Jedi mind trick.

1254
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:28,339
Just, "These are not the droids
you're looking for."

1255
00:48:28,373 --> 00:48:31,109
You ever do that?

1256
00:48:31,142 --> 00:48:32,477
You ever just check a girl
into the boards 'cause you can?

1257
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,979
You ever just been walking,
and just been, like...

1258
00:48:34,012 --> 00:48:36,247
"I love your shoes. Oops."

1259
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,451
Takes you forever,
but you finally get through

1260
00:48:40,485 --> 00:48:41,486
that jungle of people.

1261
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:42,820
You get to the bathroom.

1262
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:44,789
For those of you
that haven't been

1263
00:48:44,822 --> 00:48:46,157
in a women's restroom
late night,

1264
00:48:46,191 --> 00:48:48,326
a women's restroom late night

1265
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:51,396
looks like a scene out of
"Apocalypse Now."

1266
00:48:52,797 --> 00:48:55,000
There's gunfire, explosions,

1267
00:48:55,033 --> 00:48:57,235
blood everywhere, children,

1268
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:59,904
a lot of vietnamese men,
which I never quite understood,

1269
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:00,871
like, why they'd be there.

1270
00:49:00,905 --> 00:49:02,140
You're with your buddies

1271
00:49:02,173 --> 00:49:03,908
just trying
to get through everything.

1272
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,977
You go pee.
You get to the sink.

1273
00:49:06,011 --> 00:49:09,147
And then, your night comes
to a screeching halt

1274
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:12,050
'cause for the first time
in, like, four hours,

1275
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:14,152
you get a look at yourself
in the mirror.

1276
00:49:19,224 --> 00:49:23,628
And you see the swamp witch
that you've become.

1277
00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:29,100
Ten minutes ago, you thought
you looked like Heidi Klum.

1278
00:49:29,134 --> 00:49:31,536
It turns out you look like Seal.

1279
00:49:39,244 --> 00:49:41,446
It hits you like a ton of bricks
out of nowhere.

1280
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:42,947
And you don't know it's coming.

1281
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,249
You're sitting there
talking to your friends.

1282
00:49:44,282 --> 00:49:46,117
You're like,
"This is awesome."

1283
00:49:46,151 --> 00:49:50,688
"- I'm gonna be young forever.
- This is..."

1284
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:53,324
"No! what?
What is this?

1285
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:57,228
I was once
a great beauty."

1286
00:49:57,262 --> 00:49:59,897
"No.

1287
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:02,100
What is this?"

1288
00:50:02,133 --> 00:50:03,901
You go to touch it.
It disappears.

1289
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:04,935
You're, like...

1290
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:06,704
"Is it a hologram?
What is that?

1291
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:07,872
I look weird."

1292
00:50:07,905 --> 00:50:09,940
One eyeball has migrated here.

1293
00:50:11,242 --> 00:50:13,678
You look down.
You're just leaking vodka.

1294
00:50:16,147 --> 00:50:18,383
Now, you don't wanna hook up
with anyone.

1295
00:50:18,416 --> 00:50:23,188
Now, all you wanna do is eat.

1296
00:50:23,221 --> 00:50:25,123
I'm a red-blooded
American girl.

1297
00:50:25,156 --> 00:50:26,891
Absolutely, when I get drunk,
I would rather eat

1298
00:50:26,924 --> 00:50:28,193
than hook up with you.

1299
00:50:28,226 --> 00:50:30,828
I'm sorry.
I don't know.

1300
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,098
Give you a hand job
or go get fries?

1301
00:50:44,008 --> 00:50:45,976
Both are salty.
One will give me carpal tunnel.

1302
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:49,380
I'll go with the fries.
Every time.

1303
00:50:51,582 --> 00:50:53,118
A popular misconception
about girls

1304
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:54,152
is that we don't like to eat.

1305
00:50:54,185 --> 00:50:57,255
Girls love to eat.
Yeah.

1306
00:50:57,288 --> 00:50:58,989
We just don't like to eat
in front of a guy that we like.

1307
00:50:59,023 --> 00:51:00,258
That's the difference.

1308
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:02,193
When you first meet a guy
that you like,

1309
00:51:02,227 --> 00:51:03,728
you can't eat the way
you want to on a date.

1310
00:51:03,761 --> 00:51:05,296
You can't.

1311
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,565
You can't have that fourth plate
of ribs on a date...

1312
00:51:10,468 --> 00:51:14,939
I found out.

1313
00:51:14,972 --> 00:51:15,873
Going on a date,
society dictates

1314
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:16,974
that guys can do what they want

1315
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:18,243
and women have to be dainty.

1316
00:51:18,276 --> 00:51:20,645
So he's gonna get fries,
a burger,

1317
00:51:20,678 --> 00:51:23,414
half a gazelle,
whatever he wants to eat.

1318
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:25,783
Girls, you get the menu,
what are you ordering?

1319
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:27,818
- Salad.
- Salad.

1320
00:51:27,852 --> 00:51:34,892
Like hot little robots.
Salad.

1321
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,494
And it's
an excruciating experience

1322
00:51:36,527 --> 00:51:38,062
'cause you're trying to just
look pretty the whole time.

1323
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,264
He's sitting there
enjoying his burger.

1324
00:51:39,297 --> 00:51:41,031
You're eating your lettuce.

1325
00:51:41,065 --> 00:51:41,999
You're just sitting there
going, "Ugh."

1326
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:43,601
You've abandoned the utensils.

1327
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:45,836
You ordered, like, a koala.
You may as well eat like one.

1328
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:46,771
You're just, like...

1329
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,713
He's talking.

1330
00:51:55,746 --> 00:51:57,315
You can't focus
'cause you're starving, right?

1331
00:51:57,348 --> 00:51:58,883
He's yapping.
You're just, like...

1332
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:00,185
You finished your lettuce.

1333
00:52:00,218 --> 00:52:02,019
There's no more watercress
on the plate.

1334
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:03,053
You're just...
You pull one...

1335
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:04,489
You're looking at his food.

1336
00:52:04,522 --> 00:52:05,690
You're, like,
"What's that over there?

1337
00:52:05,723 --> 00:52:07,392
Fry."

1338
00:52:07,425 --> 00:52:10,295
Talking, talking. You can't
focus. You can't focus.

1339
00:52:10,328 --> 00:52:12,096
You're not getting any
nutrients to your brain.

1340
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,064
You're just kind of staring out
the window,

1341
00:52:14,098 --> 00:52:15,533
wondering what birds taste like.

1342
00:52:15,566 --> 00:52:17,502
You're just, like...

1343
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:20,137
You finished your lemon wedge,
like, an hour ago.

1344
00:52:20,171 --> 00:52:21,439
He's still eating.
He's still talking.

1345
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,107
And you're... you're starting
to get cold now.

1346
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,210
You're not getting any nutrition
into your bloodstream.

1347
00:52:25,243 --> 00:52:27,044
Your spine is sticking out.
You're shivering.

1348
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:28,513
You start...
You're like a lost puppy.

1349
00:52:28,546 --> 00:52:30,681
You start saying things
that you don't mean.

1350
00:52:30,715 --> 00:52:32,417
He's yapping. You start
just saying things, like,

1351
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:34,452
"I would love to spend
the afternoon with your mother.

1352
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:37,121
"That sounds great.
And no, I totally cared

1353
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,123
"about that whole replacement
refs thing.

1354
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:43,894
It really rocked my world
as well."

1355
00:52:43,928 --> 00:52:45,095
Once you're in a relationship,

1356
00:52:45,129 --> 00:52:47,398
you can eat the way you want to.

1357
00:52:47,432 --> 00:52:49,834
Once he loves you, you can roll
out a trough at mealtime.

1358
00:52:49,867 --> 00:52:51,068
It doesn't matter.

1359
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:52,203
You can put your hands behind
your back,

1360
00:52:52,237 --> 00:52:54,138
county fair
pie-eating-contest-style.

1361
00:52:56,274 --> 00:52:57,908
"I love you.
Is that the house cat?"

1362
00:53:00,311 --> 00:53:02,647
Yeah, you can let it all
hang out when he loves you.

1363
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,182
Then, you can show him
how you eat.

1364
00:53:05,216 --> 00:53:06,551
Once you're in love,
you can show him

1365
00:53:06,584 --> 00:53:10,020
the 12-foot man-eating lizard
you actually are.

1366
00:53:25,102 --> 00:53:28,072
Your eyes light up red.
Vwoom, vwoom.

1367
00:53:28,105 --> 00:53:31,008
"Let's get cheesecake."

1368
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,110
"Oh, cool, sweetheart.

1369
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:34,645
You wanna share
a piece of cheesecake?"

1370
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:37,147
"Uh-uh."

1371
00:53:37,181 --> 00:53:40,084
Tail swipe.

1372
00:53:40,117 --> 00:53:44,922
"Get your own."

1373
00:53:49,594 --> 00:53:51,496
"All right, sweetheart.
Dinner's over.

1374
00:53:51,529 --> 00:53:53,431
Did you get enough to eat?"
I love when they ask that

1375
00:53:53,464 --> 00:53:55,199
'cause I've always wanted
to give this answer.

1376
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:58,202
"Did you get enough
to eat?"

1377
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:05,109
"Uh-uh."

1378
00:54:05,142 --> 00:54:06,644
"Why?
what else do you want?"

1379
00:54:06,677 --> 00:54:08,979
"Your soul!

1380
00:54:09,013 --> 00:54:12,883
Fire!"

1381
00:54:20,325 --> 00:54:22,793
Can I ask you...
Can I ask you a question?

1382
00:54:24,395 --> 00:54:25,930
Does this tail
make my butt look big?

1383
00:54:41,912 --> 00:54:43,781
Girls love eating.
We do.

1384
00:54:43,814 --> 00:54:45,149
We were the first ones
to make it fun.

1385
00:54:45,182 --> 00:54:46,717
Hello? Apple?
Garden of Eden.

1386
00:54:46,751 --> 00:54:48,786
Mm-hmm.

1387
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:50,388
Girls love to eat.

1388
00:54:50,421 --> 00:54:52,289
I saw a Bachelorette party
take down a live Buffalo

1389
00:54:52,323 --> 00:54:54,124
at 35 miles an hour
off the freeway.

1390
00:54:54,158 --> 00:54:56,160
It was magnificent.

1391
00:54:56,193 --> 00:54:57,495
The girls ran alongside it.

1392
00:54:57,528 --> 00:55:00,297
Like, "Stacy put your veil
over his snout."

1393
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,234
You ever tried
to get a group of drunk girls

1394
00:55:04,268 --> 00:55:08,373
to walk from a bar
to a restaurant?

1395
00:55:08,406 --> 00:55:11,609
It's like herding drunk,
retarded sheep.

1396
00:55:13,277 --> 00:55:15,212
First of all, yes,
I love being a woman.

1397
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:16,781
We're amazing.
I love Beyoncé.

1398
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:19,417
But we have no idea
where we're going.

1399
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:21,452
Okay?
We're walking around.

1400
00:55:21,486 --> 00:55:23,788
All we know is that we got
little sheep hooves on

1401
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:27,792
and we're freezing
because no one brought a jacket.

1402
00:55:29,427 --> 00:55:31,195
Just walking forever, no clue.

1403
00:55:31,228 --> 00:55:32,363
"I'm cold.  I'm cold."

1404
00:55:32,397 --> 00:55:33,898
"Why didn't
you bring a jacket?"

1405
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:35,933
"'Cause I'm in my 20s
and I'm stupid."

1406
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:39,470
"I'm cold."

1407
00:55:39,504 --> 00:55:40,971
"I have to pee.
I'm cold."

1408
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:42,840
"I have to pee.
I don't have solutions.

1409
00:55:42,873 --> 00:55:44,308
Just more problems."

1410
00:55:48,513 --> 00:55:49,914
Everybody's got
that one girlfriend

1411
00:55:49,947 --> 00:55:51,015
that's a little filthy.

1412
00:55:51,048 --> 00:55:53,984
She has no issue
with peeing behind a dumpster.

1413
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:55,886
It holds everyone up.

1414
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,822
You're all trying to walk
and she's back there.

1415
00:55:57,855 --> 00:56:00,891
She's, like...

1416
00:56:00,925 --> 00:56:03,160
"You guys!"

1417
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,328
"Wa-a-a-ait."

1418
00:56:07,331 --> 00:56:09,467
"Wait, no, make sure
nobody's watching."

1419
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:12,570
You're sitting there
running interference

1420
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:15,105
for your friend, like,
"Don't look at her sheep vagina.

1421
00:56:15,139 --> 00:56:16,574
Just mine."

1422
00:56:16,607 --> 00:56:18,443
I promise you nobody's watching.

1423
00:56:18,476 --> 00:56:19,644
I promise you.

1424
00:56:19,677 --> 00:56:21,479
I promise you
no guy is driving by,

1425
00:56:21,512 --> 00:56:23,481
like, "Ugh, well,
tonight really sucks."

1426
00:56:23,514 --> 00:56:24,815
"And I..."

1427
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:27,518
"Whoa."

1428
00:56:27,552 --> 00:56:29,887
"Is that a drunk girl
peeing on hot garbage?"

1429
00:56:31,922 --> 00:56:33,257
"That's awesome."

1430
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:34,459
"Oh, what am I doing?

1431
00:56:34,492 --> 00:56:36,060
I got to get
to the craft store."

1432
00:56:42,967 --> 00:56:46,637
Oh.

1433
00:56:46,671 --> 00:56:49,273
So she's... she's done peeing.
You're all wandering.

1434
00:56:49,306 --> 00:56:50,240
Now, you're
into the second hour.

1435
00:56:50,274 --> 00:56:51,709
You're still drunk somehow.

1436
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:54,244
You're cold, you're hungry,
and you...

1437
00:56:54,278 --> 00:56:55,279
Everybody's got
that one girlfriend

1438
00:56:55,312 --> 00:56:57,014
that has a poor moral barometer.

1439
00:56:57,047 --> 00:56:59,349
She'll get in a car
with any guy...

1440
00:56:59,383 --> 00:57:02,052
As long as it looks warm.

1441
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:04,421
And she'll rationalize
why he's not a rapist

1442
00:57:04,455 --> 00:57:06,323
based solely on the way
that he's dressed.

1443
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:08,358
Every girl's
had to do this, right?

1444
00:57:08,392 --> 00:57:09,660
You have to make these, like,
game-time decisions.

1445
00:57:09,694 --> 00:57:11,061
You're, like,
"He's not gonna rape me.

1446
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:13,097
He's wearing Nike dunks."

1447
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,331
"Guys, come over here."

1448
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:15,666
Your friend goes over
to the guy.

1449
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,768
She bends down
like a streetwalker.

1450
00:57:17,802 --> 00:57:19,169
She's, like,
"Hi, what's your name?

1451
00:57:19,203 --> 00:57:20,938
"Todd?
Oh, that's a fun name.

1452
00:57:20,971 --> 00:57:22,940
"That's a really exotic name.
Oh, you'll give us a ride?

1453
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:25,275
Okay, that's really fun.
My name is Crystal."

1454
00:57:25,309 --> 00:57:26,243
"Nice to meet you.

1455
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,546
"Hold on a second.
You guys!

1456
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:30,280
He's gonna give us a ride."

1457
00:57:30,314 --> 00:57:32,483
"He's gonna give us a ride."

1458
00:57:32,517 --> 00:57:33,751
"Do you wanna go with him?"
Your friends know better.

1459
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:35,486
They're on the other side
of the street

1460
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,855
huddled together,
like, "Crystal, get away."

1461
00:57:40,658 --> 00:57:44,629
"We're not... get... he's not..."

1462
00:57:48,633 --> 00:57:50,234
Crystal's stupid,
and she's already...

1463
00:57:50,267 --> 00:57:51,702
She's, like,
"Hold on one second.

1464
00:57:51,736 --> 00:57:54,004
"Thank you so much.
I really like your chin strap.

1465
00:57:54,038 --> 00:57:56,340
It's really attractive."

1466
00:57:56,373 --> 00:57:57,374
"Hold on one second.
Hold on.

1467
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:58,543
"Let me...
You guys!

1468
00:57:58,576 --> 00:57:59,944
"He's gonna give us a ride.

1469
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:02,146
"Like, do you wanna just
keep walking?

1470
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:04,114
Sarah, you're being a bitch."

1471
00:58:04,148 --> 00:58:05,315
"You are... like, we talked
about this earlier

1472
00:58:05,349 --> 00:58:06,851
"when you were in the bathroom.

1473
00:58:06,884 --> 00:58:08,485
"You're being... this is,
like, what we talked about.

1474
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:09,754
"You're being a...
Do you not wanna...

1475
00:58:09,787 --> 00:58:11,288
"You don't wanna go with him?

1476
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,322
"You guy...
Hold on one second.

1477
00:58:12,356 --> 00:58:13,490
"Thank you so much.
Hold on one...

1478
00:58:13,524 --> 00:58:15,059
"Okay, hold on.
Hold on a sec.

1479
00:58:15,092 --> 00:58:16,360
"You guys, he's gonna give us...
He's being nice.

1480
00:58:16,393 --> 00:58:18,195
"Stop it.
Stop it.

1481
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:20,998
He's not... he's not...
He's not gonna rape us."

1482
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:25,335
"He's not gonna rape us."

1483
00:58:25,369 --> 00:58:28,372
You have to whisper
the rape part.

1484
00:58:28,405 --> 00:58:29,674
Just in case
that was his intention,

1485
00:58:29,707 --> 00:58:31,842
you don't want to offend him
ahead of time.

1486
00:58:34,545 --> 00:58:36,346
God forbid you offend him
and he leaves.

1487
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,549
Oh, no.
Then what?

1488
00:58:38,583 --> 00:58:42,419
"He's not gonna rape us.
He's wearing skechers."

1489
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:45,422
That's fair.

1490
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:46,757
Now, you're into hour three.

1491
00:58:46,791 --> 00:58:48,893
You didn't take the ride
from chin strap.

1492
00:58:48,926 --> 00:58:50,795
So you're walking.
You're cold.

1493
00:58:50,828 --> 00:58:52,563
No one knows where they're going

1494
00:58:52,597 --> 00:58:55,633
'cause you're all relying
on girl GPS.

1495
00:58:55,666 --> 00:58:57,267
For those of you
that don't know,

1496
00:58:57,301 --> 00:59:00,971
girl GPS pretty much consists
of one girl doing this:

1497
00:59:01,005 --> 00:59:04,709
"Um..."

1498
00:59:08,979 --> 00:59:10,347
"I feel
like it's this way."

1499
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:23,694
Girls, when you get drunk,

1500
00:59:23,728 --> 00:59:26,130
who are you most likely
to pick a fight with?

1501
00:59:26,163 --> 00:59:27,097
Your boyfriend.

1502
00:59:27,131 --> 00:59:28,766
Do you wanna know why?

1503
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,100
'Cause you know
he's not gonna hit you back.

1504
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,570
Every girl in here knows
that your boyfriend

1505
00:59:33,604 --> 00:59:35,773
will take a healthy dose
of your drunk ranting.

1506
00:59:35,806 --> 00:59:38,042
Why?

1507
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:39,343
'Cause at the end of the night
when you're all tuckered out,

1508
00:59:39,376 --> 00:59:40,544
he's gonna want
to mouth-kiss you

1509
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:43,814
and touch your snootch,
that's why.

1510
00:59:43,848 --> 00:59:45,683
I hate to tell you
it's why they do everything.

1511
00:59:45,716 --> 00:59:47,551
It's why they put up
with your attitude.

1512
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,019
It's why they buy you
expensive drinks.

1513
00:59:49,053 --> 00:59:50,855
It's why they let you make them
turn the game off

1514
00:59:50,888 --> 00:59:53,190
so you can show them
what you did on Pinterest.

1515
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:55,826
Okay?  For snootches.

1516
00:59:57,695 --> 00:59:59,997
"Steve, come here.
Come look at this.

1517
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:02,466
"No, like, off.
Like, turn it off.

1518
01:00:02,499 --> 01:00:03,768
"Don't p...
Just, like, shut it off.

1519
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:05,335
"I wanna show you something.
Come here.

1520
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:07,537
Come here.
Come here."

1521
01:00:07,571 --> 01:00:09,707
"Look, look what I have.
Look what I pinned.

1522
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,541
"Look at this.

1523
01:00:11,575 --> 01:00:15,813
It's an entire wedding
made of cheese."

1524
01:00:15,846 --> 01:00:19,216
"It can be our wedding."

1525
01:00:19,249 --> 01:00:23,788
"Steven?"

1526
01:00:23,821 --> 01:00:25,155
I call it a "snootch"

1527
01:00:25,189 --> 01:00:28,158
'cause I don't like
the word "vagina."

1528
01:00:28,192 --> 01:00:30,460
No one says "vagina."

1529
01:00:30,494 --> 01:00:32,362
Like, no one says that.
That's weird.

1530
01:00:32,396 --> 01:00:33,731
No one here has ever been
hooking up with someone

1531
01:00:33,764 --> 01:00:35,332
and been, like,
"this feels great.

1532
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:36,967
Continue to touch
my vagina."

1533
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:39,636
Vagina?
What?

1534
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,972
A vagina sounds
like an Indian Casino.

1535
01:00:44,942 --> 01:00:47,912
"This weekend at vagina..."

1536
01:00:47,945 --> 01:00:51,949
"Wayne Newton at vagina."

1537
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:54,384
I made up "snootch"
'cause it's so cute-sounding.

1538
01:00:54,418 --> 01:00:57,054
Snootch.

1539
01:00:57,087 --> 01:00:58,889
Snootch.

1540
01:00:58,923 --> 01:01:00,958
Maybe it would be,
like, a cartoon character.

1541
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:03,527
Maybe it would be,
like, a cute, tiny,

1542
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:07,497
furry... obviously...
Character.

1543
01:01:07,531 --> 01:01:09,734
It's got a little top hat.

1544
01:01:09,767 --> 01:01:11,335
And maybe before you have sex,

1545
01:01:11,368 --> 01:01:12,569
you have to summon snootch

1546
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:15,539
so he can bless the whole thing.

1547
01:01:15,572 --> 01:01:16,841
Yeah, that's what
you have to do.

1548
01:01:16,874 --> 01:01:18,175
You're having...
You're about to have sex.

1549
01:01:18,208 --> 01:01:20,044
You have to get out
a snootch flute

1550
01:01:20,077 --> 01:01:21,378
which you have to preorder.

1551
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:23,647
You have to order them online.

1552
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,115
It's a...
It's a dot-gov site.

1553
01:01:25,149 --> 01:01:26,851
You pull it out.

1554
01:01:26,884 --> 01:01:28,819
You're, like,
"You ready to have sex?"

1555
01:01:28,853 --> 01:01:30,755
"Sure, let's... let's...
Let's summon snootch."

1556
01:01:30,788 --> 01:01:32,122
"Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

1557
01:01:32,156 --> 01:01:37,394
Snootch!"

1558
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:38,562
"Hi, folks."
"Hi, snootch.

1559
01:01:38,595 --> 01:01:39,629
"We were just about to have sex.

1560
01:01:39,663 --> 01:01:40,564
Do we have
your blessing?"

1561
01:01:40,597 --> 01:01:41,766
"Well, you surely do.

1562
01:01:41,799 --> 01:01:43,033
"It was nice meeting
both of you,

1563
01:01:43,067 --> 01:01:44,568
"but I better be on my way.

1564
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:45,635
"Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

1565
01:01:45,669 --> 01:01:49,139
Snootch!"

1566
01:01:49,173 --> 01:01:51,976
So cute.

1567
01:01:52,009 --> 01:01:53,878
I made up "snootch"
'cause I don't like the p-word.

1568
01:01:53,911 --> 01:01:55,679
I don't like saying it.
it's not a lady word.

1569
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,848
Pussy.

1570
01:01:57,882 --> 01:01:59,449
If I got to say it,
there's gonna be

1571
01:01:59,483 --> 01:02:01,551
an involuntary facial spasm
that comes with it.

1572
01:02:01,585 --> 01:02:02,753
You should know that.

1573
01:02:02,787 --> 01:02:04,488
I will ruin any sort of moment

1574
01:02:04,521 --> 01:02:05,856
we have going in the bedroom.

1575
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:07,557
"All right, babe.
This is great.

1576
01:02:07,591 --> 01:02:09,026
Tell me where you want me
to put it."

1577
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:11,128
"I'll say it,
but you're not gonna like it."

1578
01:02:14,631 --> 01:02:16,600
"Come on. Where do you
want me to put it?"

1579
01:02:16,633 --> 01:02:19,136
"Why don't you put it
in my pussy!"

1580
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:24,975
"I can't."
"What'd you say?"

1581
01:02:25,009 --> 01:02:26,576
"Nothing.
I'm fine, I'm fine."

1582
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:27,644
"All right. Let's do this."

1583
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:28,712
"Great."
"All right, come on.

1584
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,014
"Let's get back to it.

1585
01:02:30,047 --> 01:02:31,648
All right, where do you
want me to put it?"

1586
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:33,683
"Why don't you put it
in my pussy!"

1587
01:02:33,717 --> 01:02:37,021
"No!"

1588
01:02:37,054 --> 01:02:39,589
It's not a lady word.
Ladies don't say that word.

1589
01:02:39,623 --> 01:02:41,125
Like, growing up,
did your mom ever say,

1590
01:02:41,158 --> 01:02:42,426
"pussy, you need
to shower?"

1591
01:02:42,459 --> 01:02:43,861
No, she didn't, right?

1592
01:02:43,894 --> 01:02:47,097
No, and if she did,
then your mom was white trash.

1593
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,869
It's not a lady word.

1594
01:02:51,902 --> 01:02:54,504
It's not a word that women hear
independent of men.

1595
01:02:54,538 --> 01:02:57,808
Most women don't hear that word
,
like, in professional ether.

1596
01:02:57,842 --> 01:03:00,110
No woman's laying there
at the gynecologist.

1597
01:03:00,144 --> 01:03:01,611
Doctor walks in, he's, like...

1598
01:03:01,645 --> 01:03:03,981
"What's up?"

1599
01:03:04,014 --> 01:03:07,084
"How's it hangin'?
All right, let's see.

1600
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:12,589
Pussy checks out all right."

1601
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:13,790
"Great tits, by the way.
Good hustle.

1602
01:03:13,824 --> 01:03:17,895
Get outta here."

1603
01:03:21,498 --> 01:03:22,900
It's... it's a guy word.

1604
01:03:22,933 --> 01:03:24,869
I don't care that guys say it.

1605
01:03:24,902 --> 01:03:26,703
Boys are gross, and that's
why we love them, okay?

1606
01:03:26,736 --> 01:03:28,238
But that's a guy thing.

1607
01:03:28,272 --> 01:03:30,007
That's what guys say
in the locker rooms

1608
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,176
with... with...
With all their grossness.

1609
01:03:32,209 --> 01:03:33,777
I'd imagine they go
to the locker room

1610
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,846
after a rousing game
of touch softball,

1611
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,147
and they talk
about the p-word.

1612
01:03:37,181 --> 01:03:39,616
"Hey, what's up?
What's up, bro?

1613
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:40,817
"What's up?
Did you get any...

1614
01:03:40,851 --> 01:03:41,986
Did you get any pussy
last night?"

1615
01:03:42,019 --> 01:03:43,153
"Yeah, a whole bucket."

1616
01:03:43,187 --> 01:03:48,125
I don't know
how you quantify it.

1617
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:50,527
I don't know if it goes bucket,
mug, ramekin.

1618
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,762
I don't know.

1619
01:03:52,796 --> 01:03:54,899
But that's what guys do
in the locker rooms

1620
01:03:54,932 --> 01:03:56,700
with the butt slaps
and the sword fighting.

1621
01:03:56,733 --> 01:04:00,337
That's what they do.

1622
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:01,805
We know about that.

1623
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,407
We know you do weird things
with each other

1624
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,075
with your wieners
'cause you do weird things

1625
01:04:05,109 --> 01:04:06,676
with us, and you're trying
to impress us.

1626
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:10,514
So I can only imagine
what creepiness

1627
01:04:10,547 --> 01:04:12,082
goes on behind closed doors.

1628
01:04:12,116 --> 01:04:14,284
I've seen it firsthand.

1629
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:15,785
Every girl has.

1630
01:04:15,819 --> 01:04:16,887
Every girl's had that boyfriend

1631
01:04:16,921 --> 01:04:18,688
where you're sitting on the bed

1632
01:04:18,722 --> 01:04:20,090
in your target
underwear waiting.

1633
01:04:20,124 --> 01:04:22,392
He comes out
of the bathroom naked

1634
01:04:22,426 --> 01:04:23,961
except for a t-shirt.

1635
01:04:23,994 --> 01:04:27,631
No bottoms,
Donald Ducking it the whole way.

1636
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:38,008
He's got this grin on his face.

1637
01:04:38,042 --> 01:04:40,444
And he's just, like, "Hey, babe."

1638
01:04:40,477 --> 01:04:43,847
Babe, check this out."

1639
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:51,888
Why are you doing that?

1640
01:04:51,922 --> 01:04:55,225
On behalf of all women, why?

1641
01:04:55,259 --> 01:04:58,963
It's never gonna change
a girl's mind, ever.

1642
01:04:58,996 --> 01:05:00,630
You are not helping yourself.

1643
01:05:00,664 --> 01:05:02,132
No woman, I promise you, ever...

1644
01:05:02,166 --> 01:05:04,634
You're sitting there
doing that like a circus monkey,

1645
01:05:04,668 --> 01:05:08,338
no girl is gonna
turn around, like...

1646
01:05:14,678 --> 01:05:17,614
"My, my, my."

1647
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:19,316
"You know what's crazy?"

1648
01:05:19,349 --> 01:05:22,052
"Um..."

1649
01:05:22,086 --> 01:05:27,357
"I didn't want to have sex
with you before."

1650
01:05:27,391 --> 01:05:29,893
"But now..."

1651
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:35,699
"Now that you've displayed
the agility..."

1652
01:05:35,732 --> 01:05:39,736
"Of your flaccid penis...

1653
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:44,408
"As it slaps
in rhythmic repetition...

1654
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:46,043
"Against either one

1655
01:05:46,076 --> 01:05:50,114
"of your clearly
never-seen-by-the-sun thighs,

1656
01:05:50,147 --> 01:05:53,617
now, snootch time."

1657
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:11,868
In closing, I would...

1658
01:06:11,901 --> 01:06:14,004
In closing, I would like to give

1659
01:06:14,038 --> 01:06:16,840
the girls in this room
a bit of advice, okay?

1660
01:06:16,873 --> 01:06:19,143
I have a tip for you,
but just the tip.

1661
01:06:25,015 --> 01:06:29,819
Ladies, never order a lobster
on a date.

1662
01:06:29,853 --> 01:06:31,721
The lobster is the most

1663
01:06:31,755 --> 01:06:33,523
expensive thing
on the menu, okay?

1664
01:06:33,557 --> 01:06:37,261
So just know that if you order
and consume a lobster,

1665
01:06:37,294 --> 01:06:40,597
you have to touch
your date's weiner.

1666
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:42,266
You have to, okay?

1667
01:06:42,299 --> 01:06:46,403
It's like a sexual contract
from the sea.

1668
01:06:49,606 --> 01:06:51,441
It's binding.

1669
01:06:51,475 --> 01:06:55,212
Now, keep in mind he wants you
to get the lobster.

1670
01:06:55,245 --> 01:06:57,447
He's not gonna make you get it,

1671
01:06:57,481 --> 01:06:59,483
but he's hoping you'll come
to that conclusion on your own.

1672
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:01,285
He's hoping you'll be flipping
through the menu,

1673
01:07:01,318 --> 01:07:03,387
and you'll be, like,
"I don't know what to get."

1674
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:04,954
"Like, I'm just... I don't know.
I'm eating fresh this week."

1675
01:07:04,988 --> 01:07:06,556
"I'm eating a lot
of fresh things."

1676
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:08,725
"That's my new thing, fresh.
I'm just gonna do fresh food."

1677
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:11,027
"Lobster?

1678
01:07:11,061 --> 01:07:12,829
"Should I... should I get it?
Should I get it?

1679
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,264
"Should I get the lobster?

1680
01:07:14,298 --> 01:07:15,732
"Should I crack it open
on my head like an otter,

1681
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:16,700
"eat it off my chest?

1682
01:07:16,733 --> 01:07:18,235
Lobster?"

1683
01:07:18,268 --> 01:07:19,736
"Yeah, 'cause then,
it's weiner time

1684
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:21,738
this sunday at vagina."

1685
01:07:25,475 --> 01:07:27,177
Here's how it's gonna
go down, okay?

1686
01:07:27,211 --> 01:07:28,578
You're gonna be
making out later.

1687
01:07:28,612 --> 01:07:30,647
And now, guys,
this is for you to know.

1688
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,282
Just so you know, as girls,

1689
01:07:32,316 --> 01:07:34,651
we like to make out with you
when we first meet you.

1690
01:07:34,684 --> 01:07:36,220
We like to make out with you
a couple times

1691
01:07:36,253 --> 01:07:37,854
and then leave
right when you think

1692
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,856
we're gonna sleep
with you, okay?

1693
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,558
We do it to make sure
that you like us.

1694
01:07:41,591 --> 01:07:42,892
But if you want to know
the truth,

1695
01:07:42,926 --> 01:07:46,463
they teach us this shit
in high school.

1696
01:07:46,496 --> 01:07:48,665
While you were off building
a birdhouse in shop class,

1697
01:07:48,698 --> 01:07:50,800
we were off learning
how to be annoying.

1698
01:07:50,834 --> 01:07:52,536
Here's how it happens.

1699
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:53,903
You're gonna be making out.

1700
01:07:53,937 --> 01:07:54,938
And you'll notice
that when a girl

1701
01:07:54,971 --> 01:07:56,173
makes out with you
and leaves you,

1702
01:07:56,206 --> 01:07:57,441
we always leave
in a very sweet way

1703
01:07:57,474 --> 01:07:58,975
because we want you to have

1704
01:07:59,008 --> 01:08:01,245
a nice impression of us
for later, right?

1705
01:08:01,278 --> 01:08:03,180
So it's always, like,
"Okay, well, I gotta go.

1706
01:08:03,213 --> 01:08:05,549
"Bye."
No, you didn't. No.

1707
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:08,352
"Bye. I love you too.
Stop it."

1708
01:08:08,385 --> 01:08:10,120
It's always very sweet, right?

1709
01:08:10,154 --> 01:08:11,921
I've gone as far
as to sometimes bring

1710
01:08:11,955 --> 01:08:13,190
a little thing
of vanilla body spray.

1711
01:08:13,223 --> 01:08:14,724
And when he gets up
to go to the bathroom,

1712
01:08:14,758 --> 01:08:16,025
I spray it on his pillow.

1713
01:08:16,059 --> 01:08:16,993
That way, later,
when he texts me,

1714
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:18,195
he's like, "Oh, my God."

1715
01:08:18,228 --> 01:08:19,963
My pillow still smells
like you."

1716
01:08:19,996 --> 01:08:22,632
I'm like, "That's amazing."

1717
01:08:22,666 --> 01:08:23,900
"I don't know why."

1718
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,269
You can get creative with it.

1719
01:08:25,302 --> 01:08:27,137
You can take a handful
of glitter on your date.

1720
01:08:27,171 --> 01:08:28,538
And then after you're leaving,
just be, like,

1721
01:08:28,572 --> 01:08:30,707
"Okay, I gotta go."

1722
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:32,242
"Bye."

1723
01:08:32,276 --> 01:08:34,944
You can bring a smoke bomb...

1724
01:08:34,978 --> 01:08:36,313
And then, like,
still be standing there

1725
01:08:36,346 --> 01:08:39,082
'cause you don't know magic.

1726
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,817
Girls always leave
in a sweet way.

1727
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:41,985
We never leave in a huff.

1728
01:08:42,018 --> 01:08:43,687
It's never, like,
"Well, I got mine.

1729
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,222
Eat my shit later, fuck-tard."

1730
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:49,125
Never doing that.

1731
01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:50,460
So we're gonna be
making out later.

1732
01:08:50,494 --> 01:08:52,095
And here's how it's gonna go.

1733
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:52,996
We're gonna be making out, okay?

1734
01:08:53,029 --> 01:08:55,265
So this is making out, okay?

1735
01:08:55,299 --> 01:08:57,000
I'm 12, this is what making out
looks like.

1736
01:08:57,033 --> 01:08:58,268
And the guy's gonna be, like,

1737
01:08:58,302 --> 01:09:00,003
"Oh, I like making out with you
so much."

1738
01:09:00,036 --> 01:09:01,171
"I like making out
with you."

1739
01:09:01,205 --> 01:09:03,173
"Tonight was so fun."
"It was really fun."

1740
01:09:03,207 --> 01:09:04,341
"You're so hot."
"I know."

1741
01:09:04,374 --> 01:09:06,109
"This is so fun.
I really like you.

1742
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,177
You're so pretty."
"I know, this is great.

1743
01:09:07,211 --> 01:09:10,180
I am pretty."
"Oh, I like you a lot.

1744
01:09:10,214 --> 01:09:13,149
So you wanna keep going?"
Girls, that's your cue.

1745
01:09:13,183 --> 01:09:15,752
"All right, well, I gotta go."
"What?"

1746
01:09:15,785 --> 01:09:19,756
"I gotta go, bye."

1747
01:09:19,789 --> 01:09:21,925
"Later."

1748
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:24,194
And the guy is gonna try

1749
01:09:24,228 --> 01:09:26,330
to get you to stay, right?
As he should.

1750
01:09:26,363 --> 01:09:28,498
You can't just walk
out of a spider's web.

1751
01:09:30,634 --> 01:09:32,202
"You're really gonna go?
Come on. Come on."

1752
01:09:32,236 --> 01:09:35,739
"Amber.
you really gonna go?"

1753
01:09:37,807 --> 01:09:40,744
"You really gonna go?"

1754
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:46,683
"Really gonna go?"

1755
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:57,761
"Really just go?
You're just gonna go? Huh?"

1756
01:10:14,344 --> 01:10:15,912
"You're just gonna leave it
like this?"

1757
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:18,248
"I'm sorry.

1758
01:10:18,282 --> 01:10:20,016
"Were we in the middle
of open heart surgery?

1759
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:20,784
"I'm pretty sure you're fine.

1760
01:10:20,817 --> 01:10:22,452
"Yeah.

1761
01:10:22,486 --> 01:10:25,221
"I'm not a doctor per se,
but I'm fairly confident

1762
01:10:25,255 --> 01:10:26,490
"that blood will return
to your system.

1763
01:10:26,523 --> 01:10:29,793
Walk it off, champ."

1764
01:10:31,761 --> 01:10:32,996
That might sound harsh,

1765
01:10:33,029 --> 01:10:34,331
but it took ten years
of me dating

1766
01:10:34,364 --> 01:10:37,066
to learn that a boner
isn't a medical condition.

1767
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,802
So I'm paying you back
right now.

1768
01:10:42,872 --> 01:10:44,173
Now, he's pissed,

1769
01:10:44,207 --> 01:10:45,909
mostly because he has
a raging erection

1770
01:10:45,942 --> 01:10:47,744
and you called him "champ."

1771
01:10:47,777 --> 01:10:49,713
Now, he's mad.

1772
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:51,981
"Really? you're gonna go?
That's messed up.

1773
01:10:52,015 --> 01:10:53,317
That's messed up!"

1774
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:55,018
"It's messed up, Amber.
You're just gonna go.

1775
01:10:55,051 --> 01:10:56,453
"Let me...
Just gonna go?

1776
01:10:56,486 --> 01:10:58,355
"It's funny.
It's funny.

1777
01:10:58,388 --> 01:11:00,357
"You're just gonna go
'cause, uh... huh.

1778
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:04,928
I distinctly remember
I bought you a lobster."

1779
01:11:09,299 --> 01:11:13,136
The man's right.
Time to pay the Piper.

1780
01:11:13,169 --> 01:11:14,771
Girls, you do not have
to sleep with him.

1781
01:11:14,804 --> 01:11:19,075
It's just a crustacean.
That's ridiculous, all right?

1782
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:21,345
But you got
to give him something.

1783
01:11:21,378 --> 01:11:23,613
I- I suggest a beej.
That's what I suggest.

1784
01:11:25,181 --> 01:11:26,816
That's proper.
Don't do a hand job.

1785
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:28,485
That's ridiculous.
That's child's play.

1786
01:11:30,987 --> 01:11:32,856
Hand job?
A handy? Really?

1787
01:11:32,889 --> 01:11:35,325
As a grown woman, you're not
doing a hand job, okay?

1788
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:36,826
If you voted,
you're not doing a hand job.

1789
01:11:38,828 --> 01:11:41,331
Let's send some hand jobs
overseas to China.

1790
01:11:44,568 --> 01:11:46,269
Not doing a hand job.

1791
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:47,404
A hand job, who does...
That's what kids do

1792
01:11:47,437 --> 01:11:48,838
when you're, like, a teenager.

1793
01:11:48,872 --> 01:11:51,174
You do a hand job.
You put on your promise ring.

1794
01:11:51,207 --> 01:11:53,477
You revel in your virginity
for the next 10 to 15 years

1795
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:55,111
depending on your involvement
with comic books.

1796
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,446
That's what a hand job is for.

1797
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,415
As an adult, it's not happening.

1798
01:11:58,448 --> 01:12:00,550
It's an intermediary step
in a sexual evolution

1799
01:12:00,584 --> 01:12:03,019
that you've evolved past, okay?

1800
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:07,391
It's like a tail...

1801
01:12:07,424 --> 01:12:09,192
Necessary at one point
for balance,

1802
01:12:09,225 --> 01:12:10,394
but if you busted it out
at a house party,

1803
01:12:10,427 --> 01:12:12,796
people would be,
like, weirded out.

1804
01:12:17,467 --> 01:12:20,136
I was out with a guy one time
who I wasn't even into.

1805
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:23,507
I didn't want to do anything.
And he didn't buy me a lobster.

1806
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:24,908
And I was...
I explained everything.

1807
01:12:24,941 --> 01:12:26,410
And after talking to him,

1808
01:12:26,443 --> 01:12:28,812
he's like,
"I'd like a hand job."

1809
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:32,048
"I think
it sounds great."

1810
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:33,750
And I guess I was frustrated

1811
01:12:33,783 --> 01:12:36,119
'cause he hadn't been listening
to me or my feelings.

1812
01:12:36,152 --> 01:12:37,353
And I was like, "All right."

1813
01:12:37,387 --> 01:12:40,189
"I'll tell you what, son.

1814
01:12:40,223 --> 01:12:42,626
"I'm gonna give you a hand job.

1815
01:12:42,659 --> 01:12:44,394
But it's gonna be
on my terms."

1816
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:49,098
"45 minutes long..."

1817
01:12:53,336 --> 01:12:56,440
"No lotion..."

1818
01:12:59,308 --> 01:13:00,744
"And you don't break
eye contact.

1819
01:13:00,777 --> 01:13:04,448
Go!"

1820
01:13:20,697 --> 01:13:24,468
What kills me is that you get
that I'm kidding.

1821
01:13:24,501 --> 01:13:27,437
He did not.

1822
01:13:27,471 --> 01:13:30,774
I swear to God he goes,
"Aw, no lotion?"

1823
01:13:33,309 --> 01:13:34,511
"That doesn't sound fun."

1824
01:13:34,544 --> 01:13:36,746
Like the 45-minute part
is tolerable?

1825
01:13:39,315 --> 01:13:41,384
"Iliza, come on.
You gotta do something.

1826
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,853
You gotta give me lotion
or do something cute."

1827
01:13:43,887 --> 01:13:46,656
It threw me off
that he said "cute"

1828
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:48,758
because that's not an adjective
I believe

1829
01:13:48,792 --> 01:13:53,229
belongs anywhere
near an H.J.

1830
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:54,864
It sounded creepy in a way.

1831
01:13:54,898 --> 01:13:56,633
I was like,
"What do you mean 'cute'?

1832
01:13:56,666 --> 01:13:58,434
"What... what's cute?
What do you want?

1833
01:13:58,468 --> 01:14:00,804
What do you want,
kitten paws?"

1834
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:19,956
It's probably how that one cat
lost his eye.

1835
01:14:19,989 --> 01:14:21,190
You guys are fantastic.

1836
01:14:21,224 --> 01:14:22,158
Thank you so much
for coming out.
