1
00:00:05,902 --> 00:00:07,737
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:07,737 --> 00:00:10,949
iliza shlesinger!

3
00:00:18,499 --> 00:00:20,917
All right!

4
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:24,796
Dallas, Texas!

5
00:00:24,796 --> 00:00:26,423
Thank you.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,060
Oh.

8
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,811
How are you guys doing?
Thank you for coming out, y'all.

9
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:41,522
Fantastic.

10
00:00:41,522 --> 00:00:45,734
I am so excited and honored
to be shooting my hour special

11
00:00:45,734 --> 00:00:47,444
in my hometown of Dallas, Texas.

12
00:00:47,444 --> 00:00:49,779
Yes, ma'am.

13
00:00:51,615 --> 00:00:53,367
I'm so excited to be here.

14
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:55,118
Not thrilled with getting here.

15
00:00:55,118 --> 00:00:56,703
I have to be honest.

16
00:00:56,703 --> 00:01:00,707
I fly enough that I feel
I have the right to say this.

17
00:01:00,707 --> 00:01:03,293
If you work for an airline,

18
00:01:03,293 --> 00:01:05,379
I hate you.

19
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,423
Okay? I hate you.

20
00:01:07,423 --> 00:01:08,840
And I don't want to hear,

21
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,759
"no, my cousin Sheila's
a real sweetheart.

22
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:11,927
She works for southwest."

23
00:01:11,927 --> 00:01:13,470
Fuck your cousin Sheila.

24
00:01:15,514 --> 00:01:17,433
All right, your cousin Sheila's
a goddamn bitch.

25
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:19,768
And I'll tell you
something else.

26
00:01:19,768 --> 00:01:21,395
The only reason
people work for airlines

27
00:01:21,395 --> 00:01:24,731
is because the Nazi party
is no longer hiring.

28
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:29,403
I don't have an issue...
Thank you.

29
00:01:29,403 --> 00:01:31,113
I don't have an issue
with flying.

30
00:01:31,113 --> 00:01:33,198
My issue is with the boarding
of the plane.

31
00:01:33,198 --> 00:01:35,618
Has anyone else here
ever had the misfortune

32
00:01:35,618 --> 00:01:38,787
of being stuck
in boarding zone four?

33
00:01:38,787 --> 00:01:40,456
Like, that's when
you have a seat...

34
00:01:40,456 --> 00:01:42,291
You have a ticket
'cause you're holding it...

35
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:44,084
But you're so low
on the food chain,

36
00:01:44,084 --> 00:01:45,710
it pretty much goes,
like, first-class,

37
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,130
luggage, terrorists, maybe you.

38
00:01:50,382 --> 00:01:52,635
And they take
such painstaking care

39
00:01:52,635 --> 00:01:54,261
to board zones
one through three.

40
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:56,430
And if you don't fly
that airline often enough,

41
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,973
you are s.O.L. In terms
of getting on that plane

42
00:01:57,973 --> 00:01:59,849
'cause they are boarding groups
of people

43
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:01,143
that you didn't even know

44
00:02:01,143 --> 00:02:04,354
you could apply to be part of.

45
00:02:04,354 --> 00:02:06,607
We're gonna start boarding
flight 556 to dallas/fort worth.

46
00:02:06,607 --> 00:02:08,692
We're gonna start boarding
zone one.

47
00:02:08,692 --> 00:02:10,026
These are
our first-class passengers,

48
00:02:10,026 --> 00:02:11,320
our first members,
our gold members,

49
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,571
our golden shower members.

50
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:14,781
There you go.
Thank you, there you go.

51
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:16,241
Right this way.

52
00:02:16,241 --> 00:02:18,494
Our golden eagle members,
our eagle face members.

53
00:02:18,494 --> 00:02:20,537
If you have an eagle face
instead of a person face

54
00:02:20,537 --> 00:02:22,998
'cause you lost your face

55
00:02:22,998 --> 00:02:25,668
in some sort of horrible holiday
Turkey deep fry accident,

56
00:02:25,668 --> 00:02:26,960
you didn't have enough butt fat

57
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,671
to get a nose grafted
onto your face,

58
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:30,213
so you had to borrow one
from an eagle,

59
00:02:30,213 --> 00:02:31,256
so now you have a beak,
and you like to eat mice,

60
00:02:31,256 --> 00:02:32,799
you can get on the plane.

61
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:34,384
Boarding zone two...
These are our silver members,

62
00:02:34,384 --> 00:02:36,094
our silver star members,
our silver surfer members.

63
00:02:36,094 --> 00:02:37,721
If anybody likes comic books,
you're a fuckin' nerd.

64
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:39,264
You can sit in the back
of the plane.

65
00:02:39,264 --> 00:02:41,141
Silver hair, if you're old,
hurry the fuck up.

66
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:43,185
Silver spoons, if you like
Ricky schroder, '80s TV shows,

67
00:02:43,185 --> 00:02:44,853
you were born really wealthy,
you can get on the plane.

68
00:02:44,853 --> 00:02:46,438
Silver bullet summer...
No, ma'am, you cannot bring

69
00:02:46,438 --> 00:02:47,897
your coors light
up in this, bitch.

70
00:02:47,897 --> 00:02:50,150
Boarding zone three.

71
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:55,113
These are our...

72
00:02:55,113 --> 00:02:56,865
These are our copper members,
our copper star members,

73
00:02:56,865 --> 00:02:58,241
our copper topper members.

74
00:02:58,241 --> 00:02:59,702
Is anybody using
a duracell-operated device?

75
00:02:59,702 --> 00:03:00,994
I don't give a shit
if it's a pacemaker.

76
00:03:00,994 --> 00:03:02,078
You turn that off for takeoff.

77
00:03:02,078 --> 00:03:03,330
Copperhead.

78
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,998
If you have a copperhead snake
as a pet

79
00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:06,750
instead of a normal goddamn pet
like a dog or a cat,

80
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,502
you're like, "fuck it,
I'm gonna get me a snake.

81
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:10,713
"Yeah, fuck you, dad.
I'm not going to law school.

82
00:03:10,713 --> 00:03:12,422
"I'm gonna go
to art school online

83
00:03:12,422 --> 00:03:13,840
"and learn how to draw dragons

84
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,924
"and manage a hot topic
in my spare time.

85
00:03:14,924 --> 00:03:16,134
"I love my snake.

86
00:03:16,134 --> 00:03:17,594
"I'm bringing her
to Thanksgiving.

87
00:03:17,594 --> 00:03:19,137
"Her name is Judy.
We're in snake love.

88
00:03:19,137 --> 00:03:20,347
"I love her so much.
Don't touch me, mom."

89
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:21,890
You get on the plane.

90
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,060
And boarding zone four,
you can go fuck yourself.

91
00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:34,819
Now boarding all zones.

92
00:03:36,112 --> 00:03:38,156
I spend a lot of time traveling.

93
00:03:38,156 --> 00:03:40,033
Spend a lot of time in hotels.

94
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:42,244
And as a result of it,
I watch a lot of TV.

95
00:03:42,244 --> 00:03:43,662
And I think
the saddest commercial out there

96
00:03:43,662 --> 00:03:48,291
has to be the s.P.C.A.
Sarah mclachlan ad.

97
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,876
Seen it?

98
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:52,879
With the fucked up animals?

99
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,591
Can I tell you a secret
about this commercial?

100
00:03:55,591 --> 00:03:59,052
It knows when you're alone.

101
00:04:00,387 --> 00:04:02,180
Do you ever notice
it only comes on

102
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,641
when you're by yourself,
maybe you're drunk?

103
00:04:04,641 --> 00:04:07,603
You're vulnerable, right?

104
00:04:07,603 --> 00:04:09,020
And what's crazy is at first,

105
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,356
yes, you are sad
for the animals.

106
00:04:11,356 --> 00:04:13,024
But the longer you watch it,

107
00:04:13,024 --> 00:04:16,319
the longer your sadness
kind of begins to turn on you,

108
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,654
and by the end of it, somehow,

109
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:21,283
you just feel really bad
for yourself?

110
00:04:21,283 --> 00:04:23,368
You're sitting there,
like, "oh, my God.

111
00:04:23,368 --> 00:04:25,829
There's... that cat
doesn't have a face."

112
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:28,331
I don't know. "I'm so sad.

113
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:29,625
"I feel so bad for him.

114
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,376
"And I feel so bad
for his cat family.

115
00:04:31,376 --> 00:04:34,879
And I feel so bad for... Me."

116
00:04:37,591 --> 00:04:38,759
"Oh, God. What am I gonna do?

117
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,093
"What should I do?

118
00:04:40,093 --> 00:04:42,971
I should... i should...
I should get a cat."

119
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:44,306
So you get a cat.

120
00:04:44,306 --> 00:04:46,349
But because he's
from the s.P.C.A.,

121
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:50,145
like, let's be honest, he's all,
like, fucked up and autistic.

122
00:04:50,145 --> 00:04:51,605
Just shits everywhere.

123
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:54,733
You're like, "oh, my God.
What did you eat?"

124
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:56,276
Goes through your stuff.

125
00:04:56,276 --> 00:04:59,112
He only eats the buttons
off your good sweaters.

126
00:04:59,112 --> 00:05:00,823
You're like, "how did you know
to go to for the good sweaters?

127
00:05:00,823 --> 00:05:02,282
"Why didn't you go
for the crappy sweaters?

128
00:05:02,282 --> 00:05:05,828
Why do you have
such exquisite taste?"

129
00:05:05,828 --> 00:05:08,330
Gotta get rid of him
'cause he's ruining everything.

130
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,124
But what do you do?
You can't kill him because...

131
00:05:11,124 --> 00:05:13,877
Because that's fucking insane,
I guess.

132
00:05:13,877 --> 00:05:15,170
But you gotta get rid of him.
So what do you do?

133
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,254
I'm gonna tell you.

134
00:05:16,254 --> 00:05:18,381
You put kitty in the car.

135
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:20,425
You drive him to a neighborhood
he doesn't know.

136
00:05:23,052 --> 00:05:25,764
You let him out of the car.

137
00:05:25,764 --> 00:05:27,056
Don't worry.

138
00:05:27,056 --> 00:05:31,436
The s.P.C.A. Will find that cat.

139
00:05:31,436 --> 00:05:33,062
I don't know if you've noticed.

140
00:05:33,062 --> 00:05:37,359
They're in the business
of secondhand cattery.

141
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:39,695
They find the cat.
They clean him off.

142
00:05:39,695 --> 00:05:43,239
They update his resume.

143
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:45,241
He gets a job managing,
like, a chipotle.

144
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:48,119
He's fine, all right?

145
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,705
So in honor of that commercial,

146
00:05:49,705 --> 00:05:52,875
I have a treat for you guys.

147
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,550
This is my cat.

148
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:16,815
This is my dog blanche,
and I adopted her.

149
00:06:16,815 --> 00:06:18,483
And sometimes when you adopt
an animal,

150
00:06:18,483 --> 00:06:19,943
you don't know their back story.

151
00:06:19,943 --> 00:06:23,906
So for blanche, I made one up.

152
00:06:23,906 --> 00:06:26,366
In my house,
we pretend that blanche

153
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:29,202
used to be a dog prostitute...

154
00:06:39,295 --> 00:06:41,256
Which makes sense,
because as you can tell,

155
00:06:41,256 --> 00:06:44,801
she's a little sad
behind the eyes...

156
00:06:44,801 --> 00:06:46,177
But she clearly has no problem

157
00:06:46,177 --> 00:06:47,721
with you staring
at her dog vagina.

158
00:06:56,354 --> 00:06:59,816
Make it rain.

159
00:06:59,816 --> 00:07:02,819
Shake it for the money.

160
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,447
So in honor of that commercial,
she and I are now going to do

161
00:07:05,447 --> 00:07:07,031
our rendition of it for you.

162
00:07:07,031 --> 00:07:10,285
Here we go.

163
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:15,373
In the arms

164
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:19,294
of the angel,

165
00:07:19,294 --> 00:07:23,632
far away

166
00:07:23,632 --> 00:07:26,342
from here,

167
00:07:26,342 --> 00:07:32,015
in this dark, cold hotel room,

168
00:07:32,015 --> 00:07:34,267
and the end,

169
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:38,313
dah, dah, dah, dah, dah

170
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:43,610
you were pulled...

171
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,780
That's it.
That's it for blanche.

172
00:07:52,744 --> 00:07:54,078
Let's get serious.

173
00:07:54,078 --> 00:07:55,747
My dog is so cute,
I want to hurt her.

174
00:07:55,747 --> 00:07:57,415
Do you ever get that way?

175
00:07:57,415 --> 00:07:59,167
When something is so cute,
it makes you angry.

176
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:01,294
I just want to rip its nose
and...

177
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:03,005
You ever get that way
when something is so cute,

178
00:08:03,005 --> 00:08:04,464
you don't know if you can
trust yourself around it?

179
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:05,841
I used to get that way
with my Nana.

180
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:07,425
She's, like, this tall,
and you ever hug

181
00:08:07,425 --> 00:08:08,885
your grandparent,
and you're, like, "oh, my God,

182
00:08:08,885 --> 00:08:10,219
I just wanna push you
down the stairs."

183
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:12,597
You ever feel that way?

184
00:08:12,597 --> 00:08:13,890
You ever feel the urge,
just, "what if I just..."

185
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,309
"Just feel like..."

186
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:17,894
Hypothetically.

187
00:08:17,894 --> 00:08:20,188
Sometimes, I get that way
around garbage disposals.

188
00:08:20,188 --> 00:08:22,748
You ever just put your hand in
just to feel the... feel the fear?

189
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:28,154
You reach the other hand over.

190
00:08:28,154 --> 00:08:29,614
You don't touch the switch,
but you hover around it?

191
00:08:29,614 --> 00:08:30,699
You're like, "what if I just..."

192
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:32,034
"No!"

193
00:08:34,577 --> 00:08:38,456
I don't do that either.
It was just a joke.

194
00:08:38,456 --> 00:08:41,001
Sometimes you get that way
with cute things, like babies.

195
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:42,502
Sometimes babies are so cute.

196
00:08:42,502 --> 00:08:43,879
Sometimes babies
are not so cute.

197
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:45,714
But sometimes babies... so cute,

198
00:08:45,714 --> 00:08:47,007
you know,
fat, little, baby cheek.

199
00:08:47,007 --> 00:08:49,592
You just want
to rip his cheek off.

200
00:08:54,056 --> 00:08:55,598
But you can't 'cause you won't

201
00:08:55,598 --> 00:08:57,059
be allowed
around the baby anymore.

202
00:08:57,059 --> 00:08:59,310
That's for goddamn sure.

203
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,104
There was another version
of that commercial.

204
00:09:01,104 --> 00:09:03,773
What happened was they aired
that commercial.

205
00:09:03,773 --> 00:09:06,484
And it was such a hit, so many
people were adopting pets,

206
00:09:06,484 --> 00:09:08,403
so many people
were donating money,

207
00:09:08,403 --> 00:09:12,574
so many people were
going on antidepressants.

208
00:09:12,574 --> 00:09:14,158
And they were like,
"let's do another one."

209
00:09:14,158 --> 00:09:16,452
So they tried to recreate
the magic of that one.

210
00:09:16,452 --> 00:09:17,954
So in this commercial, they play

211
00:09:17,954 --> 00:09:19,706
another Sarah mclachlan song,
okay?

212
00:09:19,706 --> 00:09:23,418
I don't know the song,
but it's some lesbian chant.

213
00:09:23,418 --> 00:09:24,460
That's happening.

214
00:09:26,546 --> 00:09:29,507
And they zoom in
on these pictures

215
00:09:29,507 --> 00:09:30,759
of these jacked up animals.

216
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:32,468
And at the bottom of the screen,

217
00:09:32,468 --> 00:09:35,931
they put a caption
of what the animal is thinking?

218
00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:41,895
Now, where they got
that information, I don't know.

219
00:09:41,895 --> 00:09:43,980
They show a dog,
and he's all no teeth.

220
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,650
He's just awful-looking,
like, "nah!"

221
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,444
"Where's my family?"

222
00:09:49,444 --> 00:09:51,780
"I don't know!"

223
00:09:53,656 --> 00:09:55,909
They show another dog,
and he's all muddy and gnarly.

224
00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:58,620
He's just, "nah!"

225
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,580
"I hope they come back for me."

226
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,624
"Nah!

227
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:04,834
"Dad, you said you was
going for cigarettes.

228
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:07,295
"Why?

229
00:10:07,295 --> 00:10:10,090
It's me, spot."

230
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,633
And then, they showed a cat.

231
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:14,010
And this cat was,
like, 45 pounds.

232
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,180
It... it had one eye.

233
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,765
And it turned... do you know him?

234
00:10:18,765 --> 00:10:21,893
And it turned around...
He turned around in slow motion,

235
00:10:21,893 --> 00:10:23,478
and it wasn't a camera trick.

236
00:10:23,478 --> 00:10:26,397
He's just, like,
a 45-pound cat, I guess.

237
00:10:26,397 --> 00:10:27,983
He doesn't have,
like, a meeting to rush to.

238
00:10:27,983 --> 00:10:29,192
So he's not...

239
00:10:44,373 --> 00:10:49,629
"I'm sorry
for whatever I did wrong."

240
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:51,547
No, that's where I stopped
buying that commercial.

241
00:10:51,547 --> 00:10:54,176
There's no way
a cat has remorse.

242
00:10:55,677 --> 00:10:56,928
You ever met a cat?

243
00:10:56,928 --> 00:10:58,471
There's no way he's apologetic.

244
00:10:58,471 --> 00:11:00,056
Whatever that cat did
to land him in cat jail,

245
00:11:00,056 --> 00:11:01,557
he's not sorry he did it.

246
00:11:01,557 --> 00:11:02,976
He's sorry he got caught.

247
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:06,188
There's a difference.

248
00:11:11,026 --> 00:11:12,568
That cat's as hard as they come.
He doesn't give a shit.

249
00:11:12,568 --> 00:11:14,445
He's sitting there
in his little cat cell.

250
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:17,949
He's got "meow mix for life"
tattooed on his little belly.

251
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:19,951
He's got a little rat
that he's made his bitch.

252
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:22,370
It's carving a shiv
out of cheese in the corner.

253
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,039
He's got one sharpened cat claw.

254
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:26,624
He's just running it
against the bars, like, "brr.

255
00:11:26,624 --> 00:11:28,501
Brr."

256
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:29,627
Oh, yeah, he's got one eye.
I forgot.

257
00:11:29,627 --> 00:11:32,172
"Brr. Brr."

258
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:33,673
He's like, "hear me?"

259
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:36,634
"I don't give a fuck."

260
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:38,053
"You think I care?

261
00:11:38,053 --> 00:11:40,013
"Oh, hell, yeah,
I scratched up your curtains.

262
00:11:40,013 --> 00:11:42,473
And I'd do it again. Fuck you."

263
00:11:44,226 --> 00:11:46,769
This is a cat paw.

264
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:55,361
That commercial is sad.

265
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:57,197
The commercial that makes me
feel the worst about myself,

266
00:11:57,197 --> 00:12:01,284
I would have to say, would be
the p90x commercials.

267
00:12:01,284 --> 00:12:05,371
That commercial always comes on
when I'm eating...

268
00:12:06,873 --> 00:12:08,332
Which is the worst time

269
00:12:08,332 --> 00:12:10,293
for any fitness commercial
comes on 'cause it knows

270
00:12:10,293 --> 00:12:12,378
when you're sitting there
being a little fatty,

271
00:12:12,378 --> 00:12:14,130
eatin' Graham crackers
with your shirt off,

272
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,298
watching "Law & Order: SVU."

273
00:12:15,298 --> 00:12:17,383
It knows.

274
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:19,802
And it comes on, and it gets
you, you're just sittin' there.

275
00:12:19,802 --> 00:12:21,054
You're like,
"I'll never find love.

276
00:12:21,054 --> 00:12:23,306
I don't know. I don't..."

277
00:12:23,306 --> 00:12:25,100
"Do you want to get in shape?"

278
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,811
You're like...

279
00:12:31,355 --> 00:12:33,691
And by the way,
it's not asking you

280
00:12:33,691 --> 00:12:36,319
if you want to get
in regular-person shape.

281
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:37,820
It's not talking
to normal people.

282
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,530
It's talking
to, like, Navy seals.

283
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,157
It's talking to crazy people.

284
00:12:41,157 --> 00:12:43,326
It's not asking you
if you want to look mediocre

285
00:12:43,326 --> 00:12:44,869
when you go to the pool
this summer, uh-uh.

286
00:12:44,869 --> 00:12:46,704
It's just for crazy...
It's saying,

287
00:12:46,704 --> 00:12:49,373
"hey, faggot, do you want to get
in such fucking good shape

288
00:12:49,373 --> 00:12:51,251
"so fucking quickly
that your arms

289
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:52,961
"and your...
And your chest and your back

290
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:54,712
"get too big to fit
through normal doorways,

291
00:12:54,712 --> 00:12:57,590
"so every time you come through,
you smash into the plaster,

292
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,800
"and you're costing your mother
thousands of dollars

293
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,842
"in drywall damage?

294
00:12:59,842 --> 00:13:01,303
"Is that what you want?

295
00:13:01,303 --> 00:13:02,929
"Do you want your friends
and family to fear you

296
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:04,597
"because you drink
horse testosterone

297
00:13:04,597 --> 00:13:07,267
"and creatine shakes,
and they make you sleep outside?

298
00:13:07,267 --> 00:13:09,518
"Is that what you fuckin' want?

299
00:13:09,518 --> 00:13:11,146
"Do you want to get so huge
so quickly,

300
00:13:11,146 --> 00:13:12,647
"so unnaturally,
that all your clothes

301
00:13:12,647 --> 00:13:14,649
"shrink on you,
and they fit like baby clothes

302
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:16,484
"'cause you're like the hulk
mid-transformation,

303
00:13:16,484 --> 00:13:18,361
"and you can't afford
to buy new clothes

304
00:13:18,361 --> 00:13:21,323
'cause you spent all your money
on these fucking p90x DVDs?"

305
00:13:28,955 --> 00:13:30,623
My question is why?

306
00:13:30,623 --> 00:13:32,834
Why would the average guy

307
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:35,378
want to get that jacked
that fast?

308
00:13:35,378 --> 00:13:39,048
Why? So you can, what,
be the strongest manager

309
00:13:39,048 --> 00:13:42,760
at the verizon store?

310
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,346
What are you doing
with that muscle?

311
00:13:44,346 --> 00:13:46,514
You work in sales.
You're not guarding sparta.

312
00:13:46,514 --> 00:13:49,351
It's fine.

313
00:13:49,351 --> 00:13:52,061
"This is smart phone."

314
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,565
I think p90x has
a subliminal message

315
00:13:56,565 --> 00:13:58,401
that a lot of us are missing

316
00:13:58,401 --> 00:14:00,362
'cause I don't think they're
talking to regular people.

317
00:14:00,362 --> 00:14:03,406
I think the commercial needs
to be honest and come clean

318
00:14:03,406 --> 00:14:05,908
and say what their product
is really meant for.

319
00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:07,660
The commercial
should sound like this.

320
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,205
"Hey, p90x guy here. What's up?

321
00:14:10,205 --> 00:14:13,833
"So did you,
like, recently commit a crime,

322
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,627
"and you've been sentenced
to prison,

323
00:14:16,627 --> 00:14:20,965
and you have to report there
in 90 days, so..."

324
00:14:26,554 --> 00:14:29,515
"You figure in the interim,

325
00:14:29,515 --> 00:14:31,142
"you'll just get as huge
as possible

326
00:14:31,142 --> 00:14:33,144
"for fear of the safety
of your butthole?

327
00:14:33,144 --> 00:14:35,730
P90x."

328
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:39,859
Yeah.

329
00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:41,444
It's a prison workout.

330
00:14:41,444 --> 00:14:42,904
They're like, "you can do it

331
00:14:42,904 --> 00:14:44,488
from the comfort
of your own living room."

332
00:14:44,488 --> 00:14:46,032
That's 'cause your living room
and a jail cell

333
00:14:46,032 --> 00:14:47,575
are roughly
the same square footage.

334
00:14:47,575 --> 00:14:48,993
Do the math.

335
00:14:48,993 --> 00:14:50,453
Think about it. "No equipment.

336
00:14:50,453 --> 00:14:52,288
No excuses."
No shit there's no equipment.

337
00:14:52,288 --> 00:14:53,956
You'll get raped
with equipment in prison.

338
00:14:53,956 --> 00:14:55,875
You can't have it there.

339
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,710
"We here at p90x
want you to get creative

340
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,170
"with your workout.
Fuck your antiques, bro.

341
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,296
"Your girlfriend's
gonna break up with you

342
00:15:00,296 --> 00:15:01,672
"when you go to jail anyway.

343
00:15:01,672 --> 00:15:03,341
"May as well use shit
around your house.

344
00:15:03,341 --> 00:15:05,093
"Take your dining room table.
Cut off the back legs.

345
00:15:05,093 --> 00:15:06,469
"Put it at an angle.

346
00:15:06,469 --> 00:15:08,263
"Now, you have a bench
for incline presses.

347
00:15:08,263 --> 00:15:10,265
"P90x.

348
00:15:10,265 --> 00:15:11,974
"Go ahead.
Grab your old kenwood speakers.

349
00:15:11,974 --> 00:15:13,226
"That's right.
Take 'em off the front lawn.

350
00:15:13,226 --> 00:15:14,727
"Use those for weight.

351
00:15:14,727 --> 00:15:15,978
"You can take water bottles.
Dump that shit out.

352
00:15:15,978 --> 00:15:16,979
"Fill 'em up with sand.

353
00:15:16,979 --> 00:15:18,522
"Use those for bicep curls

354
00:15:18,522 --> 00:15:20,149
"'cause you're too cheap
to buy a shake weight.

355
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:21,359
"You're gonna get enough of this
in prison.

356
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:22,610
P90x."

357
00:15:29,951 --> 00:15:33,288
The problem with p90x
is that it works.

358
00:15:33,288 --> 00:15:37,333
Like, yes,
it will change your body,

359
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:41,129
but only from the neck down.

360
00:15:42,671 --> 00:15:44,173
They don't tell you
in the commercial

361
00:15:44,173 --> 00:15:49,387
your face stays
exactly the same as it was.

362
00:15:49,387 --> 00:15:51,722
"Do you want to have the body
of a 20-year-old adonis,

363
00:15:51,722 --> 00:15:53,933
"but go ahead and keep the face

364
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:57,812
"of a balding,
middle-aged accountant?

365
00:15:57,812 --> 00:16:00,022
"P90x, disappoint your wife
from the chin up

366
00:16:00,022 --> 00:16:02,608
on a nightly basis."

367
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:03,985
These guys at p90x,

368
00:16:03,985 --> 00:16:05,611
you want to look hot,
just get in shape.

369
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:08,323
I think women in our country
have too many options

370
00:16:08,323 --> 00:16:10,492
for weight loss
to the point of paralysis.

371
00:16:10,492 --> 00:16:11,993
There's so many options.

372
00:16:11,993 --> 00:16:14,245
You go on TV, the Internet,
women's magazines.

373
00:16:14,245 --> 00:16:16,622
There's so many,
you can't even make a choice.

374
00:16:16,622 --> 00:16:18,416
I was reading a women's magazine
the other day

375
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:21,169
'cause I wanted to punish myself

376
00:16:21,169 --> 00:16:22,337
and just feel awful,

377
00:16:22,337 --> 00:16:24,339
and they had
all these diet tips.

378
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:26,174
Diet tips for ladies.

379
00:16:26,174 --> 00:16:27,800
I saw this one in "cosmo."

380
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,927
They suggested that women,
if you're on a diet,

381
00:16:29,927 --> 00:16:32,263
"next time you're on a diet
and you're hungry,

382
00:16:32,263 --> 00:16:34,098
don't ruin the day..."
'cause your whole day is ruined

383
00:16:34,098 --> 00:16:35,433
if you eat a doughnut,
by the way.

384
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:38,102
You have
to kill yourself immediately.

385
00:16:38,102 --> 00:16:40,062
"Don't ruin the day
by grabbing a fried snack.

386
00:16:40,062 --> 00:16:42,690
Instead, just grab
a handful of almonds."

387
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,526
Just go out... just go and grab
a handful of almonds.

388
00:16:44,526 --> 00:16:46,319
You ever do this?

389
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:48,112
When you're hungry, you get
a handful of... you don't do that?

390
00:16:48,112 --> 00:16:49,447
You don't go up
to the nearest tree

391
00:16:49,447 --> 00:16:50,768
and just giraffe yourself like...

392
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:59,665
"Cindy, I'll be right there."

393
00:16:59,665 --> 00:17:01,042
Handful of almonds.

394
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:02,793
"Cosmo" says get a handful
of almonds.

395
00:17:02,793 --> 00:17:04,086
Just go ahead, get a handful
of almonds, and get a hand...

396
00:17:04,086 --> 00:17:05,463
Why don't you go fuck yourself

397
00:17:05,463 --> 00:17:07,131
with a handful
of almonds, "cosmo"?

398
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:08,591
See how full you get off that.

399
00:17:08,591 --> 00:17:12,387
I'm a grown woman,
not a sugar squirrel.

400
00:17:12,387 --> 00:17:13,429
Almonds.

401
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:15,223
Juicing. That's a big thing.

402
00:17:15,223 --> 00:17:16,932
"Why don't you just juice it?
Do you want to just juice?

403
00:17:16,932 --> 00:17:19,227
"We should do juices
and smoothies.

404
00:17:19,227 --> 00:17:20,728
You wanna make a smoothie?"

405
00:17:20,728 --> 00:17:22,605
You pronounce smoothie like this

406
00:17:22,605 --> 00:17:25,046
'cause you only need this much
of your mouth open to drink it.

407
00:17:26,025 --> 00:17:29,945
Smoothie.

408
00:17:29,945 --> 00:17:31,197
They want women to do this.

409
00:17:31,197 --> 00:17:32,490
Take all your food,
juice it down.

410
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,075
Go get your carrots.
Get your kale.

411
00:17:34,075 --> 00:17:36,411
Don't forget the kale.
Get your kale.

412
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:37,870
Get the apples.
Put it in the juicer.

413
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,455
Go ahead and juice the apple
and the celery.

414
00:17:39,455 --> 00:17:41,123
Put your hand in the juicer.
Juice your hand down.

415
00:17:41,123 --> 00:17:42,750
Juice your hand
right down to the nub.

416
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,586
Make sure you juice all of it.
You'll lose 2 ounces.

417
00:17:44,586 --> 00:17:47,255
Drink your hand, there's lots
of nutrients in your hand.

418
00:17:47,255 --> 00:17:48,881
"Cosmo" never said
to juice your hand.

419
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:50,049
I'm just gonna
put that out there.

420
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:51,551
Make a smoothie.

421
00:17:51,551 --> 00:17:53,302
Do you have time in the morning
to make a smoothie?

422
00:17:53,302 --> 00:17:54,220
You have time for this?

423
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,971
No? Shocking.

424
00:17:55,971 --> 00:17:57,599
You don't have time
in the morning

425
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:00,435
to go out to your own
personal botanical garden

426
00:18:00,435 --> 00:18:02,562
and cut down
a brontosaurus brunch

427
00:18:02,562 --> 00:18:03,812
worth of broccoli and asparagus,

428
00:18:03,812 --> 00:18:05,106
juice it down to an ounce,

429
00:18:05,106 --> 00:18:06,441
so you can shit green
for a week?

430
00:18:06,441 --> 00:18:08,192
You don't have time?

431
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,573
I love being
a stand-up comedian.

432
00:18:13,573 --> 00:18:16,618
It's probably the best job ever.

433
00:18:16,618 --> 00:18:18,536
Uh, if I could have any job...

434
00:18:18,536 --> 00:18:19,912
If I could have any job,
I would be a cat.

435
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:22,540
But that is not something

436
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,252
I'm supposed
to talk about in public.

437
00:18:26,252 --> 00:18:28,087
If I could have any job
besides this,

438
00:18:28,087 --> 00:18:32,300
I know this sounds weird,
but I would be a pharmacist

439
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,009
because I would be...

440
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:35,803
Like, I would add
something cool to it.

441
00:18:35,803 --> 00:18:37,888
I would be, like, a different
kind of pharmacist, okay?

442
00:18:37,888 --> 00:18:39,348
So I would
do it differently, okay?

443
00:18:39,348 --> 00:18:41,392
So... so I would look
like a pharmacist.

444
00:18:41,392 --> 00:18:42,560
I would wear the white coat,

445
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,061
'cause without the white coat,

446
00:18:44,061 --> 00:18:45,896
you're just a drug dealer.

447
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,942
I'd wear the white coat,
but under it,

448
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:51,569
I would go to, like,
a renaissance fair.

449
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:53,488
We have renaissance fairs here?
All: Yeah.

450
00:18:53,488 --> 00:18:55,823
Yes! Of course we do.
Every state's got white trash.

451
00:18:55,823 --> 00:18:59,201
Of course we do.
So I'd go to a renaissance fair.

452
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:01,829
And I would go to, like,
the witch doctor's tent.

453
00:19:01,829 --> 00:19:04,624
And I would get one of those,
like, medieval witch woman belts

454
00:19:04,624 --> 00:19:06,000
that has, like, some leather.

455
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,377
And it's got bells
and raccoon pelts

456
00:19:08,377 --> 00:19:10,713
and a jug
for your ale, whatever.

457
00:19:10,713 --> 00:19:13,174
And it'd have, like, a jar
of pigeon whisperers.

458
00:19:13,174 --> 00:19:15,009
I'd have all these things,
all the accoutrement

459
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:16,719
of a creepy witch on my belt.

460
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:18,762
And I'd put it under the coat
so that when I walked,

461
00:19:18,762 --> 00:19:21,015
the coat would flare open,
and you'd get glimpses

462
00:19:21,015 --> 00:19:22,600
of my medieval trickery
under it.

463
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,727
Just...

464
00:19:24,727 --> 00:19:26,562
And you'd be in line
at the pharmacy.

465
00:19:26,562 --> 00:19:28,564
And you'd be like, "what's up
with that one pharmacist?

466
00:19:28,564 --> 00:19:29,982
"Is she into the dark arts?

467
00:19:29,982 --> 00:19:32,026
"Is she a sorceress?
Magic with a 'k'?

468
00:19:32,026 --> 00:19:35,029
Does she play "skyrim" alone?
What is that?"

469
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:38,449
And I wouldn't come up
to the counter.

470
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:40,535
Instead... instead of a bell
that you ring,

471
00:19:40,535 --> 00:19:42,453
I would get...
I would get a raven.

472
00:19:42,453 --> 00:19:44,913
I would stuff a raven.

473
00:19:44,913 --> 00:19:47,166
And I would give it a beard.
I'd glue on the beard.

474
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,001
I would spend my time
gluing the beard on,

475
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:50,712
and it would have a beard, and
I would sit him on the perch,

476
00:19:50,712 --> 00:19:52,380
so when you came up
to the counter,

477
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,839
you'd have to pull the beard.

478
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:57,677
And then the raven will go...

479
00:19:57,677 --> 00:19:59,928
That's my cue to appear.

480
00:19:59,928 --> 00:20:03,599
And then I'd... pfft. Yes?

481
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:06,268
Secretly, I was waiting under
the counter to hear the raven.

482
00:20:06,268 --> 00:20:08,563
And then... pfft. Yes?

483
00:20:08,563 --> 00:20:09,689
I was right there.
There's no magic.

484
00:20:09,689 --> 00:20:10,939
I'm right there.

485
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:13,025
Yes, my child?

486
00:20:13,025 --> 00:20:14,902
I call you my child

487
00:20:14,902 --> 00:20:16,987
'cause that's what
creepy people do.

488
00:20:16,987 --> 00:20:18,614
Yes?

489
00:20:18,614 --> 00:20:19,907
And you'd hand me
your prescription.

490
00:20:19,907 --> 00:20:23,118
And I'd say, "okay, one moment."

491
00:20:23,118 --> 00:20:25,913
And I'd have a hump.
Oh, yeah, I have a hump.

492
00:20:25,913 --> 00:20:27,164
You gotta have a hump.

493
00:20:27,164 --> 00:20:28,332
If you're gonna be
making medicine,

494
00:20:28,332 --> 00:20:29,792
you gotta have a hump

495
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:32,836
'cause the hump says
that you're serious.

496
00:20:32,836 --> 00:20:34,213
A hump is your calling card.

497
00:20:34,213 --> 00:20:36,215
A hump says,
"I'm not out partying.

498
00:20:36,215 --> 00:20:37,466
"I'm not out getting drunk.

499
00:20:37,466 --> 00:20:39,635
"I'm downstairs in the basement

500
00:20:39,635 --> 00:20:42,597
"studying alchemy and...
And witchery.

501
00:20:42,597 --> 00:20:44,056
"And I'm learning how to turn

502
00:20:44,056 --> 00:20:45,391
"newt thoughts
into rat eyeballs.

503
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:47,142
"I'm doing things like that.

504
00:20:47,142 --> 00:20:49,311
"I'm learning the proper use
for an erlenmeyer flask.

505
00:20:49,311 --> 00:20:51,313
I'm down there
doing these things, okay?"

506
00:20:51,313 --> 00:20:53,107
So I have the hump, and then...

507
00:20:53,107 --> 00:20:55,359
And then, I'd take your...
I'd take your prescription.

508
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:59,363
And... one moment.

509
00:20:59,363 --> 00:21:02,575
I have a limp too...

510
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:03,992
'Cause the limp

511
00:21:03,992 --> 00:21:06,704
comes with the hump, standard.

512
00:21:08,205 --> 00:21:10,708
And then I would set to work
making your medicine.

513
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,627
So I'd be back here,
and I would have my back to you.

514
00:21:12,627 --> 00:21:14,670
And I'd... I'd have
all these sound effects

515
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:17,381
on, like, a keyboard ready,
so you would be standing there.

516
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:18,507
And you'd hear like...

517
00:21:21,385 --> 00:21:23,262
"Eh, one moment."

518
00:21:26,682 --> 00:21:29,769
And I would also have
a closed-circuit TV right here,

519
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:33,021
so I could watch everything
in the pharmacy, okay?

520
00:21:33,021 --> 00:21:34,774
So you would go to,
like, touch something,

521
00:21:34,774 --> 00:21:36,108
and I would see you on the TV.

522
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:37,819
And I would just say this,

523
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:40,738
"I wouldn't touch that
if I were you."

524
00:21:40,738 --> 00:21:43,699
But I'm just watching you.

525
00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:45,618
And I have...
And, like, an hour later,

526
00:21:45,618 --> 00:21:48,203
I'd emerge with your medicine

527
00:21:48,203 --> 00:21:49,455
in the orange bottle.

528
00:21:49,455 --> 00:21:50,832
Like, I didn't make your shit.

529
00:21:50,832 --> 00:21:53,041
I had it ready to go.

530
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:55,544
I was just wasting your time...

531
00:21:55,544 --> 00:21:57,087
'Cause a hump suggests
that I'm making it,

532
00:21:57,087 --> 00:21:58,922
so I want you
to follow that fantasy.

533
00:21:58,922 --> 00:22:01,300
I didn't... i don't know how
to make medicine out of herbs.

534
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,301
I'm not Chinese.

535
00:22:02,301 --> 00:22:05,929
So I have it.

536
00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:07,264
And I'd come up to the counter.

537
00:22:07,264 --> 00:22:09,057
And I'd say...
And I'd set it down.

538
00:22:09,057 --> 00:22:13,270
And I'd say, "would you like
a consultation?"

539
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:17,149
And you'd say, "sure."
And I'd say, "okay."

540
00:22:17,149 --> 00:22:18,860
And I'd hold up your pill
to the light.

541
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,569
I shouldn't touch your medicine,
but I'm going to.

542
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:23,405
I'd hold it up, and I'd say,
"take one!"

543
00:22:23,405 --> 00:22:25,157
One, one.

544
00:22:25,157 --> 00:22:27,075
And I'd have all the other
pharmacists flip the lights

545
00:22:27,075 --> 00:22:29,119
on and off to make it...

546
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,538
And they'd put lighters up
to the sprinklers.

547
00:22:30,538 --> 00:22:31,789
And we'd get
one of the fog machines

548
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:32,998
left over
from our Halloween sale.

549
00:22:32,998 --> 00:22:33,999
And pfft,

550
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:35,543
and it would fill the room.

551
00:22:35,543 --> 00:22:37,461
And we'd have people
wafting it with car mats

552
00:22:37,461 --> 00:22:40,088
just to make it go
in some sort of circle.

553
00:22:40,088 --> 00:22:43,509
"Take one
on the seventh solstice

554
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:45,803
of the third vernal equinox."

555
00:22:45,803 --> 00:22:48,472
It's two different times a year,
but it's just a bit.

556
00:22:48,472 --> 00:22:52,184
"Take one in the presence...

557
00:22:52,184 --> 00:22:53,853
"presence of a righteous man

558
00:22:53,853 --> 00:22:55,437
"with the blood of a virgin.

559
00:22:55,437 --> 00:22:56,647
"Also with crackers,

560
00:22:56,647 --> 00:23:00,693
so you don't upset your tummy."

561
00:23:00,693 --> 00:23:02,528
I give it to you,
and as you are going to leave,

562
00:23:02,528 --> 00:23:03,654
you didn't even say anything.

563
00:23:03,654 --> 00:23:05,239
I'd say, "wait!"

564
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:07,700
I grab you...

565
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,827
Grab you with a grabbing hand.

566
00:23:09,827 --> 00:23:11,412
What's a grabbing hand?
I'm gonna tell you.

567
00:23:11,412 --> 00:23:12,955
You can't...
If you're gonna grab someone

568
00:23:12,955 --> 00:23:14,707
and you want to instill fear
in their hearts,

569
00:23:14,707 --> 00:23:16,124
you can't grab
with a well-manicured hand

570
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:17,209
with, like, a pretty ring.

571
00:23:17,209 --> 00:23:18,878
No one's gonna be afraid.

572
00:23:18,878 --> 00:23:20,003
If I grab you with this hand,
you'd be like, "what?

573
00:23:20,003 --> 00:23:21,129
That sounds awesome."

574
00:23:21,129 --> 00:23:22,882
It's got to be creepy, okay?

575
00:23:22,882 --> 00:23:24,216
Someone grabs you
out of a grave.

576
00:23:24,216 --> 00:23:26,051
What does it look like?
It's sinewy.

577
00:23:26,051 --> 00:23:27,845
It's got dirty nails.
It's all "Thriller"-looking.

578
00:23:27,845 --> 00:23:30,222
Just nah! Gonna grab him.

579
00:23:30,222 --> 00:23:31,265
How do you make a grabbing hand?

580
00:23:31,265 --> 00:23:32,558
I'm going to tell you.

581
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:33,809
You put your hand
outside your car

582
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:35,477
for two hours a day,

583
00:23:35,477 --> 00:23:39,440
so it tans quicker
than the rest of you.

584
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,400
You take special liver pills
that prevent your liver

585
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,860
from functioning on this side.

586
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,738
So you start to get liver spots
all over, okay?

587
00:23:45,738 --> 00:23:46,948
Now, you gotta make
your fingers creepy.

588
00:23:46,948 --> 00:23:48,449
So maybe... so this finger...

589
00:23:48,449 --> 00:23:50,409
You've got, like, a coke nail
on that finger.

590
00:23:50,409 --> 00:23:52,995
This one's got, like... like,
a raccoon eyeball for a ring.

591
00:23:52,995 --> 00:23:54,705
Maybe this...
You don't need this finger.

592
00:23:54,705 --> 00:23:56,791
You cut this one off totally
'cause you lost it...

593
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:58,208
You lost it in the hobbit bore.

594
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,251
I don't care.

595
00:23:59,251 --> 00:24:01,921
And then you get a bracelet

596
00:24:01,921 --> 00:24:04,256
made of, like, whore gypsy
Kardashian hair.

597
00:24:04,256 --> 00:24:06,592
You wrap your hand in it.

598
00:24:09,011 --> 00:24:10,972
And just as you're...
I pull out my grabbing hand.

599
00:24:10,972 --> 00:24:13,849
I have it sheathed.
It's sheathed in a sheath.

600
00:24:13,849 --> 00:24:15,977
And, uh...

601
00:24:15,977 --> 00:24:17,770
Just as you were leaving,
I'd go, "wait!"

602
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,271
You'd be, like, "what?"

603
00:24:19,271 --> 00:24:23,275
And I'd say,
"there's one more thing."

604
00:24:23,275 --> 00:24:25,360
And I'd pull out a hand
of magic dust,

605
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,405
which is just sand from the
beach aisle in the pharmacy.

606
00:24:28,405 --> 00:24:30,574
I'd pull...
I'd pull out a hand of dust.

607
00:24:30,574 --> 00:24:33,953
And I would just go...

608
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,582
"Do you have a cvs card?"

609
00:24:51,386 --> 00:24:52,721
I love walking
around pharmacies.

610
00:24:52,721 --> 00:24:54,473
I love doing that.

611
00:24:54,473 --> 00:24:55,933
I can't... i can't go to
a pharmacy and not spend money.

612
00:24:55,933 --> 00:24:57,434
One of the products
that creeps me out...

613
00:24:57,434 --> 00:24:59,311
They have a product
at every pharmacy

614
00:24:59,311 --> 00:25:02,481
called "k-y intense."

615
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:04,232
You seen the commercials
for this thing?

616
00:25:04,232 --> 00:25:05,859
The commercial for...
First of all,

617
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,529
the commercial for k-y intense
is super offensive.

618
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:09,572
And we will talk about that.

619
00:25:09,571 --> 00:25:10,864
In the c... first of all,

620
00:25:10,865 --> 00:25:12,658
if you've ever used k-y intense,

621
00:25:12,658 --> 00:25:15,077
you know that it's intense
because it burns.

622
00:25:16,537 --> 00:25:17,955
I will volunteer that.

623
00:25:17,955 --> 00:25:19,164
I accidentally used it
one time thinking, like,

624
00:25:19,164 --> 00:25:20,541
"this is gonna be magical."

625
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:21,876
And it burned.

626
00:25:21,876 --> 00:25:23,794
And I promise you
girls don't want that.

627
00:25:23,794 --> 00:25:24,962
In my life,
I've never been, like,

628
00:25:24,962 --> 00:25:26,714
"man, that sex was awesome.

629
00:25:26,714 --> 00:25:28,674
"But you know what I wanted
to feel, like, right after?

630
00:25:28,674 --> 00:25:32,511
Fire."

631
00:25:34,262 --> 00:25:35,472
Of course, they don't bill it

632
00:25:35,472 --> 00:25:37,432
as a burning sensation on TV.

633
00:25:37,432 --> 00:25:38,833
They call it
"a tingling sensation."

634
00:25:39,935 --> 00:25:41,269
And they try to, like, talk
to the girls.

635
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:42,730
They're like,
"ladies, do you want

636
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,272
"more pleasure
out of your three minutes?

637
00:25:44,272 --> 00:25:45,649
Do you want that? Okay."

638
00:25:47,275 --> 00:25:48,861
"Well, k-y intense is great

639
00:25:48,861 --> 00:25:50,821
"'cause it's a tingling
sensation for her

640
00:25:50,821 --> 00:25:52,114
"and he gets to use his penis.

641
00:25:52,114 --> 00:25:55,910
So everybody wins."

642
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,703
But even if it... even if it was

643
00:25:57,703 --> 00:26:00,081
a tingling sensation,
we live in a society

644
00:26:00,081 --> 00:26:01,999
preconditioned to not
want tingling.

645
00:26:01,999 --> 00:26:03,751
We don't like tingling.

646
00:26:03,751 --> 00:26:06,253
We know that tingling, it means
a bad thing is happening.

647
00:26:06,253 --> 00:26:08,338
"Hey, everyone, grandma says
her arm is tingling."

648
00:26:08,338 --> 00:26:10,257
"Oh, she must be having
an orgasm."

649
00:26:13,928 --> 00:26:15,220
"You don't have to rush her
to the hospital.

650
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,555
"She's laying on the ground

651
00:26:16,555 --> 00:26:17,890
"with her eyes rolled back
in her head.

652
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:20,768
She's clearly enjoying herself."

653
00:26:20,768 --> 00:26:23,520
Tingling. It's horrible.

654
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,855
You ever hit your funny bone
and been, like...

655
00:26:24,855 --> 00:26:25,981
"Ahh."

656
00:26:28,109 --> 00:26:31,445
The commercial is awful
because it's two British people.

657
00:26:31,445 --> 00:26:34,156
And they're sitting there
having breakfast.

658
00:26:34,156 --> 00:26:35,616
And they're discussing
all the sex

659
00:26:35,616 --> 00:26:37,910
that they had
the night before...

660
00:26:39,161 --> 00:26:40,871
'Cause they used
the k-y intense.

661
00:26:40,871 --> 00:26:43,331
But because the brits are very
tacit about sexual things,

662
00:26:43,331 --> 00:26:45,084
they're not coming right out
and discussing it.

663
00:26:45,084 --> 00:26:46,293
They're speaking in code.

664
00:26:46,293 --> 00:26:47,628
And at the bottom of the screen

665
00:26:47,628 --> 00:26:50,422
are the subtitles in American

666
00:26:50,422 --> 00:26:52,091
so we can understand
what they're saying.

667
00:26:52,091 --> 00:26:53,550
So they're sitting there,
and they're eating.

668
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,011
They're having
their... porridge.

669
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,015
They're eating
their curds and whey.

670
00:27:00,015 --> 00:27:02,935
I don't care what the brits eat.
We won the war, so there.

671
00:27:02,935 --> 00:27:05,604
Right?

672
00:27:05,604 --> 00:27:07,314
So they're sitting there.
And they're eating it.

673
00:27:07,314 --> 00:27:10,567
And it's just very quiet.
And they're just...

674
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:24,748
Teeth out to here.

675
00:27:31,088 --> 00:27:35,176
And the girl looks at the guy.

676
00:27:35,176 --> 00:27:37,594
"Wonderful dessert
last night, sire."

677
00:27:37,594 --> 00:27:40,514
She didn't say "sire."

678
00:27:40,514 --> 00:27:41,974
They don't talk
like that anymore.

679
00:27:41,974 --> 00:27:45,811
So she talks,
and there's subtitles.

680
00:27:45,811 --> 00:27:47,437
"Wonderful dessert last night."

681
00:27:47,437 --> 00:27:49,356
"Hey! What'd you put
on my puss, nigga?"

682
00:27:49,356 --> 00:27:53,568
And then the guy...

683
00:27:53,568 --> 00:27:54,778
Responds in kind.

684
00:27:54,778 --> 00:27:56,697
He's like, "oh, yes, 'twas...

685
00:27:56,697 --> 00:27:57,781
"'twas a bit of a new recipe.

686
00:27:57,781 --> 00:27:59,200
Hoped you liked it."

687
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,243
"Put some of that k-y shit
on my dick, bitch.

688
00:28:01,243 --> 00:28:03,078
How you like me now?"

689
00:28:06,623 --> 00:28:08,416
And then, the girl is,
like, "oh, yes.

690
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:10,669
'Twas quite invigorating.
Didn't expect that one."

691
00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:12,254
"You fucking kidding me
with that shit?

692
00:28:12,254 --> 00:28:13,922
"What'd you put?
Ants on your dick?

693
00:28:13,922 --> 00:28:15,632
Is this a joke?"

694
00:28:15,632 --> 00:28:17,300
"You want
to fucking die, motherfucker?

695
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,344
"You want to end up on snap?
I'll fucking kill you.

696
00:28:19,344 --> 00:28:20,679
This fuckin' hurt."

697
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:24,183
Then the guy, like, "oh, yes,

698
00:28:24,183 --> 00:28:25,600
"tried a spin on an old recipe.

699
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,352
Tried a dash of nutmeg."

700
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,231
And there were
no subtitles for that

701
00:28:30,231 --> 00:28:31,899
because I think
they fucking do use nutmeg.

702
00:28:31,899 --> 00:28:33,441
And that's what makes it
burn so much.

703
00:28:38,697 --> 00:28:41,408
I know a lot about sex
and dating.

704
00:28:41,408 --> 00:28:42,701
I know a lot about dating

705
00:28:42,701 --> 00:28:44,619
because I watch a lot of dates.

706
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,622
That sounds creepy.
I host a dating show.

707
00:28:47,622 --> 00:28:49,750
So I've learned a lot
about men and women

708
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,085
and their interactions.

709
00:28:51,085 --> 00:28:53,003
And one important thing
that I've learned

710
00:28:53,003 --> 00:28:56,673
is that when you like someone
and you want to impress them,

711
00:28:56,673 --> 00:28:57,883
what do you do?

712
00:28:57,883 --> 00:29:00,010
You lie.

713
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:02,221
You have to,
because if people knew

714
00:29:02,221 --> 00:29:03,680
how weird you were
in your off time,

715
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,058
no one would have you.

716
00:29:06,058 --> 00:29:07,976
A guy says to you, "what do
you like to do for fun?"

717
00:29:07,976 --> 00:29:09,770
Girls, you can't be honest.

718
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,106
You can't be honest
about that shit.

719
00:29:12,106 --> 00:29:13,690
You can't be honest
about what you were doing

720
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,859
10 minutes before you came
to the door.

721
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:17,152
You have to lie.

722
00:29:17,152 --> 00:29:18,237
"What do you like
to do for fun?"

723
00:29:18,237 --> 00:29:19,529
You can't tell him.

724
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:21,031
You can't be, like,
"I really enjoy

725
00:29:21,031 --> 00:29:22,741
"choreographing naked
cheerleading routines

726
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:24,160
"to old Britney Spears cds.

727
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,119
"And then, I Google
a bunch of hentai porn,

728
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,788
"masturbate, don't wash
my hands,

729
00:29:27,788 --> 00:29:29,372
"Facebook stalk my ex-boyfriend
and his ex-girlfriends,

730
00:29:29,372 --> 00:29:31,250
"jot down their place of
employment for future reference.

731
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,584
"And then, I go
bake some cookies.

732
00:29:32,584 --> 00:29:34,253
"And then, I mouth-kiss my dog

733
00:29:34,253 --> 00:29:35,587
and promise her that one day
she'll be my wife."

734
00:29:35,587 --> 00:29:37,798
You can't say that.

735
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:40,259
Nine times out of ten,
a guy asks a girl,

736
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:41,593
"what do you like to do
for fun?"

737
00:29:41,593 --> 00:29:44,012
The girl's answer
will be, "hiking."

738
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:50,894
"I love hiking. I do.

739
00:29:50,894 --> 00:29:52,687
I do... don't I?
I do. I love hiking."

740
00:29:54,148 --> 00:29:55,482
"I do, hiking's..."

741
00:29:55,482 --> 00:29:56,441
"I love hiking."

742
00:29:59,236 --> 00:30:00,737
"I do. I love it.
I love hiking."

743
00:30:00,737 --> 00:30:02,447
"No, you don't. Stop lying.

744
00:30:02,447 --> 00:30:04,283
"You don't like... really, Stacy?
You like hiking?

745
00:30:04,283 --> 00:30:06,534
"Where are your trail spikes?
Where's your walking stick?

746
00:30:06,534 --> 00:30:08,954
Where's your lesbian
Mountain partner?"

747
00:30:10,205 --> 00:30:11,498
You don't like hiking.

748
00:30:11,498 --> 00:30:13,334
You don't even know
what hiking is.

749
00:30:13,334 --> 00:30:16,044
Most modern girls don't really
know what hiking is, okay?

750
00:30:16,044 --> 00:30:17,629
To the average girl, hiking is

751
00:30:17,629 --> 00:30:19,047
you wake up whenever you want,

752
00:30:19,047 --> 00:30:20,715
you put on lululemon yoga pants

753
00:30:20,715 --> 00:30:22,884
'cause they make your butt
look unreasonably good

754
00:30:22,884 --> 00:30:26,180
as they should
for 800 fucking dollars.

755
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,722
And you go for a walk
in the park

756
00:30:27,722 --> 00:30:28,849
with your best friend
and complain

757
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:30,225
about how hung over you are.

758
00:30:30,225 --> 00:30:34,396
That's hiking.

759
00:30:34,396 --> 00:30:37,107
Yeah. I do it too.

760
00:30:37,107 --> 00:30:38,525
Promise you this, girls.

761
00:30:38,525 --> 00:30:40,402
It's not a sport
if you can drink a Starbucks

762
00:30:40,402 --> 00:30:42,821
and have a pita
while you're doing it.

763
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:43,864
"Do you want a piece of pita?"

764
00:30:43,864 --> 00:30:46,241
"I'm hiking."

765
00:30:46,241 --> 00:30:47,617
But there's a method
to our madness.

766
00:30:47,617 --> 00:30:49,786
There's a reason women
say "hiking."

767
00:30:49,786 --> 00:30:53,081
We say hiking because we think
guys like hiking.

768
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:54,416
That's why we're doing it.

769
00:30:54,416 --> 00:30:55,750
Be outside where the bugs are?

770
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,669
No! We think you like that.

771
00:30:57,669 --> 00:31:00,047
We're taught to believe
that men are outdoorsy,

772
00:31:00,047 --> 00:31:01,923
and rugged,
and they like nature.

773
00:31:01,923 --> 00:31:03,633
As far as we're concerned,

774
00:31:03,633 --> 00:31:07,221
you're the closest thing
we know to a bear.

775
00:31:09,264 --> 00:31:10,681
So we say hiking, hoping to have

776
00:31:10,682 --> 00:31:11,767
something in common with you.

777
00:31:11,766 --> 00:31:13,310
We honestly say "hiking"

778
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,229
hoping that you'll be,
like, "you like hiking?

779
00:31:15,229 --> 00:31:20,234
I like hiking. Marry me."

780
00:31:20,234 --> 00:31:21,776
It's the easiest thing
you can say that you do.

781
00:31:21,776 --> 00:31:23,695
It's one of the only
outdoor activities

782
00:31:23,695 --> 00:31:25,989
that you can lie
and say that you do it

783
00:31:25,989 --> 00:31:27,824
having never done it before,

784
00:31:27,824 --> 00:31:31,953
and then do it and pull it off
because it's walking.

785
00:31:31,953 --> 00:31:33,621
You can't pull that off,

786
00:31:33,621 --> 00:31:36,375
you shouldn't be mating
with anyone.

787
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:37,918
You ca... most outdoor activities

788
00:31:37,918 --> 00:31:39,627
require a decent amount
of skill.

789
00:31:39,627 --> 00:31:42,172
For example, you can't say
you like rock climbing

790
00:31:42,172 --> 00:31:44,383
if you've never been
rock climbing.

791
00:31:44,383 --> 00:31:46,718
I mean, you can,
but I promise you this.

792
00:31:46,718 --> 00:31:50,472
You're gonna go.
You're gonna slip.

793
00:31:50,472 --> 00:31:53,350
You're gonna get your hand
caught in a rock.

794
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:57,187
127 hours later...

795
00:32:02,109 --> 00:32:03,735
Stump's not getting you
a second date.

796
00:32:03,735 --> 00:32:05,570
I promise you that.

797
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,239
I don't know if girls
wanna hear this,

798
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:09,199
but the truth is
90% of the activities

799
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:10,658
that women engage in

800
00:32:10,658 --> 00:32:13,120
revolve around getting
a guy's attention, okay?

801
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,247
And it's just the way
we're built biologically.

802
00:32:15,247 --> 00:32:16,748
This is just something we do.

803
00:32:16,748 --> 00:32:18,208
We love to get your attention.

804
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:19,834
It's part of the sport of it,
all right?

805
00:32:19,834 --> 00:32:21,544
You think I go to a sports bar

806
00:32:21,544 --> 00:32:22,963
because I like warm beer
and sticky barstools?

807
00:32:22,963 --> 00:32:24,631
No. I go 'cause there's
guys there.

808
00:32:24,631 --> 00:32:26,007
You think I do a pub crawl
every year

809
00:32:26,007 --> 00:32:27,384
'cause I like it
when my liver hurts?

810
00:32:27,384 --> 00:32:29,094
No! I go 'cause there's
guys there.

811
00:32:29,094 --> 00:32:30,262
We don't wear heels
for our circulation.

812
00:32:30,262 --> 00:32:31,846
We do it to prop up our butt

813
00:32:31,846 --> 00:32:33,390
so you'll look at me
and want to mate with me.

814
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,766
That's why we do it.

815
00:32:34,766 --> 00:32:36,393
This isn't a fucking game,
all right?

816
00:32:36,393 --> 00:32:38,061
This isn't a push-up bra.
It's body armor.

817
00:32:38,061 --> 00:32:39,438
And this ain't
makeup, sweetheart.

818
00:32:39,438 --> 00:32:41,731
It's war paint.
Let's make a baby.

819
00:32:50,782 --> 00:32:53,618
Girls know exactly
what they're doing.

820
00:32:53,618 --> 00:32:55,496
We know exactly what you like,
what you don't like.

821
00:32:55,496 --> 00:32:57,247
We do our research
when we like a guy.

822
00:32:57,247 --> 00:32:59,666
And by research,
I mean we Facebook stalk you.

823
00:32:59,666 --> 00:33:01,418
We do it.

824
00:33:01,418 --> 00:33:02,710
I know your favorite foods.

825
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,212
I know
where you went on vacation.

826
00:33:04,212 --> 00:33:06,131
I know that your favorite team
is the cowboys.

827
00:33:06,131 --> 00:33:08,008
I know all about that.
I'm totally into you.

828
00:33:08,008 --> 00:33:09,468
That's right.

829
00:33:09,468 --> 00:33:11,345
They say men are hunters
and women are gatherers.

830
00:33:11,345 --> 00:33:13,347
Well, kind of.
Women are gatherers.

831
00:33:13,347 --> 00:33:15,098
We like to gather information
about you.

832
00:33:15,098 --> 00:33:17,851
And then we hunt you.

833
00:33:17,851 --> 00:33:19,727
You think when I bring you home
to meet mom on Christmas

834
00:33:19,727 --> 00:33:21,563
it's 'cause I want her
to meet you?

835
00:33:21,563 --> 00:33:24,483
No, it's so I can be, like,
"mom, look what I caught."

836
00:33:27,235 --> 00:33:29,029
We have to, because guys
are kind of passive

837
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:30,613
when it comes to meeting women.

838
00:33:30,613 --> 00:33:32,449
Sure, they go out.
But girls make a sport of it.

839
00:33:32,449 --> 00:33:33,867
My guy friends don't care.

840
00:33:33,867 --> 00:33:35,285
If they had their way,
they'd spend

841
00:33:35,285 --> 00:33:37,078
every Saturday night
with each other...

842
00:33:37,078 --> 00:33:39,247
Which is weird...
Watching "1000 ways to die,"

843
00:33:39,247 --> 00:33:41,082
eating sandwiches,
ragging on their one friend

844
00:33:41,082 --> 00:33:42,543
that has a huge nut sack
for no reason.

845
00:33:42,543 --> 00:33:45,086
Like, that's what they would do.

846
00:33:45,086 --> 00:33:47,672
Going out's very important.

847
00:33:47,672 --> 00:33:49,591
You got a real job, your weekend
is very important to you,

848
00:33:49,591 --> 00:33:51,468
because a weekend represents
48 hours

849
00:33:51,468 --> 00:33:53,928
that you have
to fuck up the life

850
00:33:53,928 --> 00:33:56,390
that you worked so hard for
all week.

851
00:34:01,102 --> 00:34:02,354
That's what your weekend is.

852
00:34:02,354 --> 00:34:03,980
If you're a real professional,

853
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:07,484
your weekend starts Thursday
at, like, 5:00 P.M.

854
00:34:07,484 --> 00:34:09,069
Right? You go to happy hour.

855
00:34:09,069 --> 00:34:10,237
Happy hour trickles
into, like, nighttime.

856
00:34:10,237 --> 00:34:11,946
You're drinking a little bit

857
00:34:11,946 --> 00:34:14,199
'cause you can go to work
a little hung over, right?

858
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,992
No one's doing real work
on Friday.

859
00:34:15,992 --> 00:34:17,994
Nobody's working on a Friday.

860
00:34:17,994 --> 00:34:19,538
Nobody's working on a Friday
'cause it's what?

861
00:34:19,538 --> 00:34:20,914
Shabbat. No.

862
00:34:20,914 --> 00:34:23,958
Because it's Friday
and nobody cares.

863
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:25,919
You ever been at work, your boss
is never gonna be, like,

864
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:27,962
"let's get in those reports
and start brainstorming."

865
00:34:27,962 --> 00:34:29,464
You're, like,
"okay, I'll be there."

866
00:34:32,384 --> 00:34:33,760
"Oh, you were serious?
Okay, little hand job.

867
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,040
I'll be at my desk.
That's fine."

868
00:34:38,265 --> 00:34:39,766
Girls take going out
very seriously

869
00:34:39,766 --> 00:34:41,602
'cause that's
our hunting grounds.

870
00:34:41,602 --> 00:34:43,645
"Going out. Let's do it."

871
00:34:45,606 --> 00:34:48,066
"Do you want to do,
like, a girls' night?

872
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:50,277
Do you wanna do that?"

873
00:34:50,277 --> 00:34:51,861
Every weekend, I get calls
from my girlfriends.

874
00:34:51,861 --> 00:34:53,655
"Do you want to do,
like, just girls?

875
00:34:53,655 --> 00:34:55,823
"Do you want to do,
like, a fun girls' night?

876
00:34:55,823 --> 00:34:57,409
Iliza, I'm talking to you.
Iliza."

877
00:34:57,409 --> 00:34:58,535
"Do you want to do that?

878
00:34:59,702 --> 00:35:00,995
"Do you wanna do,

879
00:35:00,995 --> 00:35:02,372
"like, a girls'...
We'll just do...

880
00:35:02,372 --> 00:35:03,665
"oh, we'll all wear,
like, fun shoes.

881
00:35:03,665 --> 00:35:05,375
"And we'll all get, like, apis.

882
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:06,460
And then, we'll do,
like, a fun girls' night."

883
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,586
"Do you wanna do that?

884
00:35:07,586 --> 00:35:08,878
"I wanna do a girls' night.

885
00:35:08,878 --> 00:35:10,422
I made an evite
for the four of us."

886
00:35:13,133 --> 00:35:14,426
"You didn't answer."

887
00:35:14,426 --> 00:35:15,927
"'Cause I'm standing
right here."

888
00:35:15,927 --> 00:35:18,346
"You're such a bitch."

889
00:35:18,346 --> 00:35:19,640
"Let's do a girls' night.
Let's do just girls.

890
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,015
"No boys.

891
00:35:21,015 --> 00:35:23,602
Let's just all wear wedges
and no boys."

892
00:35:25,812 --> 00:35:27,939
"Let's not do boys, just girls.
Just the girls."

893
00:35:27,939 --> 00:35:29,983
I'm like, "why?

894
00:35:29,983 --> 00:35:32,694
We hate each other."

895
00:35:32,694 --> 00:35:34,237
Girls hate each other.

896
00:35:34,237 --> 00:35:36,657
Esp... she hates you,
especially during the day.

897
00:35:38,492 --> 00:35:40,994
But when the moon comes up
and there's white wine involved,

898
00:35:40,994 --> 00:35:44,956
"oh, my God.
Stacy, you look amazing.

899
00:35:44,956 --> 00:35:47,501
I fucking love you."

900
00:35:47,501 --> 00:35:48,793
And you notice
the drunker you get,

901
00:35:48,793 --> 00:35:51,212
the more Spanish
you start speaking?

902
00:35:51,212 --> 00:35:54,048
"Oh, my God.
Mamacita, muy caliente.

903
00:35:54,048 --> 00:35:56,259
Whoo!"

904
00:35:56,259 --> 00:36:00,054
"Fucking love you, chica."

905
00:36:00,054 --> 00:36:01,931
But the more love you give
to one girlfriend,

906
00:36:01,931 --> 00:36:05,477
the more love you must taketh
away from another girlfriend.

907
00:36:05,477 --> 00:36:07,521
It's how we keep balance
in the girl universe.

908
00:36:07,521 --> 00:36:09,981
"I love you.
Can I just tell you?"

909
00:36:09,981 --> 00:36:12,526
"I love you, I do.

910
00:36:12,526 --> 00:36:13,735
"But you know who I hate?

911
00:36:13,735 --> 00:36:14,235
"Becky.

912
00:36:19,115 --> 00:36:21,576
"She's a bitch."

913
00:36:21,576 --> 00:36:24,329
"No, I hate her
even though she drove me here

914
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:26,581
and I'm wearing her top."

915
00:36:29,751 --> 00:36:31,169
"Can I just tell you that?

916
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:32,504
"Like, for real,
like, I hate her.

917
00:36:32,504 --> 00:36:34,214
"Will you not tell her?
Do you promise?

918
00:36:34,214 --> 00:36:36,424
"Do you... do you prom...
You won't tell her?

919
00:36:36,424 --> 00:36:37,800
"Do you pinky swear?

920
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,219
"Do you pinky s...
Do you pinky swear?

921
00:36:39,219 --> 00:36:40,345
"Even though
I'm a grown fucking woman

922
00:36:40,345 --> 00:36:41,888
"that pays taxes and votes,

923
00:36:41,888 --> 00:36:45,308
do you wanna pinky swear?"

924
00:36:45,308 --> 00:36:46,976
"This is ironclad.
Do you pinky swear?

925
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,562
"Okay, come here.
No, here, take my hand.

926
00:36:48,562 --> 00:36:51,314
"I wanna talk to you. Come here.

927
00:36:51,314 --> 00:36:53,650
"No, like, earlier, like...
Here, come here, come here.

928
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,610
"Like, earlier, she was just,
like, being, like, a bitch.

929
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,237
"And I was, like,
'what's your problem?

930
00:36:57,237 --> 00:36:59,364
I don't even understand.'"

931
00:36:59,364 --> 00:37:01,199
"now, she's like, 'why
are you being, like, so rude?

932
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:03,993
'And, like... what, are you, like,
bipolar or, like, manic?

933
00:37:03,993 --> 00:37:05,746
'Like I just freely use
these psychological terms

934
00:37:05,746 --> 00:37:07,414
"cause I don't know
what I'm talking about.'

935
00:37:07,414 --> 00:37:09,999
"and she was, like, being,
like... wait, wait.

936
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:11,834
"Is she looking?

937
00:37:11,834 --> 00:37:13,461
"Did she hear me talking
about her?

938
00:37:13,461 --> 00:37:15,963
"Is she... pretend like we're
not talking about her.

939
00:37:18,216 --> 00:37:19,426
"Is she gone?

940
00:37:19,426 --> 00:37:20,885
"No, but,
like, that's the thing.

941
00:37:20,885 --> 00:37:22,387
"Like, earlier, she was just,
like, being,

942
00:37:22,387 --> 00:37:25,973
"like, passive-aggressive
and, like, crazy.

943
00:37:25,973 --> 00:37:27,809
"And, like..."

944
00:37:27,809 --> 00:37:29,770
"And I was just, like..."

945
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,271
"She was just being,
like, a freak.

946
00:37:31,271 --> 00:37:32,980
"And she was just,
like, disrespecting me.

947
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:36,818
"And, like... no, no, like,
when you do it, it's fine."

948
00:37:39,529 --> 00:37:41,448
"Right?

949
00:37:41,448 --> 00:37:45,493
Because we get each other
'cause we're both pisces."

950
00:37:45,493 --> 00:37:47,454
Which means nothing.

951
00:37:47,454 --> 00:37:48,830
"Do you wanna do that?

952
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,164
"Do you wanna do a girls night?

953
00:37:50,164 --> 00:37:51,750
"Fuck yeah.
Why don't you come over?

954
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,543
"'Us weekly',
Jennifer Aniston, hang out,

955
00:37:53,543 --> 00:37:55,336
"'Love actually"
watch a movie, braid our hair,

956
00:37:55,336 --> 00:37:56,797
stiff as a board, "light
as a feather, have some candy,

957
00:37:56,797 --> 00:37:58,381
"have some cake,

960
00:38:01,426 --> 00:38:03,094
"have a piece of cake,

961
00:38:03,094 --> 00:38:04,679

"Sounds great, Cindy.

962
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:06,306

963
00:38:06,306 --> 00:38:08,057

964
00:38:08,057 --> 00:38:10,477
"You got 'grey's anatomy'
on DVD? Awesome.

965
00:38:10,477 --> 00:38:13,730
"Pop it in. Let's lez out.
Where's your brother?"

966
00:38:20,236 --> 00:38:24,574
Yeah. Let's make that happen.

967
00:38:24,574 --> 00:38:26,284
Tired of feeling
like a sexual deviant

968
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:27,744
'cause I just enjoy a little bit

969
00:38:27,744 --> 00:38:30,705
of mouth-kissing
with my red wine, okay?

970
00:38:30,705 --> 00:38:32,666
Look, that's what most girls
want, by the way.

971
00:38:32,666 --> 00:38:34,292
We just wanna make out,
just a little bit.

972
00:38:34,292 --> 00:38:35,335
Right at the beginning
when you first meet,

973
00:38:35,335 --> 00:38:36,503
they want to make out.

974
00:38:36,503 --> 00:38:37,629
That's what most girls want.

975
00:38:37,629 --> 00:38:39,130
"I wanna do some fun shoes,

976
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:41,132
red wine, make out,
weiner touch, go to bed."

977
00:38:41,132 --> 00:38:43,009
That's what we want...

978
00:38:43,009 --> 00:38:44,302
When you first meet someone.

979
00:38:44,302 --> 00:38:45,595
Look, let's not
get crazy, right?

980
00:38:45,595 --> 00:38:47,388
Just make out, and...

981
00:38:47,388 --> 00:38:50,141
And then that's it.

982
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:51,976
Just real quick, in that order.

983
00:38:51,976 --> 00:38:53,436
You don't want
to have drunk sex.

984
00:38:53,436 --> 00:38:55,188
That's a whole mess.

985
00:38:55,188 --> 00:38:57,607
Drunk sex, there's emotions,
ankle sprains, paper work.

986
00:38:57,607 --> 00:39:01,695
There's, like,
a whole thing involved.

987
00:39:01,695 --> 00:39:03,237
Girls like making out.

988
00:39:03,237 --> 00:39:05,365
It's a sentiment
echoed by almost any girl

989
00:39:05,365 --> 00:39:06,949
in any bar on any night.

990
00:39:06,949 --> 00:39:08,326
You pick any bar in the country.

991
00:39:08,326 --> 00:39:09,911
You find a girl,
she's gonna be drunk,

992
00:39:09,911 --> 00:39:11,287
face on sideways, just, like...

993
00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:17,126
"I just want to make out
with a boy.

994
00:39:17,126 --> 00:39:18,670
"I just want to make out
with a boy.

995
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:21,130
"I do, I just want to make out
with some boy.

996
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:23,675
That's all I want."

997
00:39:23,675 --> 00:39:25,510
"I do. I'm pretty, right?"

998
00:39:27,595 --> 00:39:31,683
"I just want..."

999
00:39:36,479 --> 00:39:41,108
"Saved it."

1000
00:39:41,108 --> 00:39:42,193
That's what you hear.

1001
00:39:42,193 --> 00:39:43,820
You rarely hear a girl talk

1002
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,363
about having sex
with a stranger.

1003
00:39:45,363 --> 00:39:47,031
I understand it happens.

1004
00:39:47,031 --> 00:39:48,408
I understand
that there's one-night stands.

1005
00:39:48,408 --> 00:39:50,034
But rarely does a girl go out

1006
00:39:50,034 --> 00:39:52,161
with the intention of having sex
with a stranger.

1007
00:39:52,161 --> 00:39:53,747
Rarely do you hear a girl, like,

1008
00:39:53,747 --> 00:39:56,624
"I just want to, like, go out,
and, like, party,

1009
00:39:56,624 --> 00:39:58,209
"and, like, meet some dude,
and go home with him,

1010
00:39:58,209 --> 00:39:59,460
"and then have sex with him,
and then wake up,

1011
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,795
"and realize
I never got his name.

1012
00:40:00,795 --> 00:40:01,880
"But he's already gone
to the gym.

1013
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,130
"So I can't ask him.

1014
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,591
"So I go over
to his coffee table,

1015
00:40:04,591 --> 00:40:05,717
"and I find a phone bill
with his name on it.

1016
00:40:05,717 --> 00:40:07,051
"And I put it in my pocket,

1017
00:40:07,051 --> 00:40:08,411
and I go home
with the phone bill."

1018
00:40:09,637 --> 00:40:11,639
"And I get home to my computer,
and I take it out.

1019
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:13,975
"I'm like, 'Brian Williamson.
That's a generic fucking name.'

1020
00:40:13,975 --> 00:40:15,685
"so I look up all 90,000
Brian williamsons on Facebook

1021
00:40:15,685 --> 00:40:16,937
"until I find the one
that resembles him.

1022
00:40:16,937 --> 00:40:18,020
"And then, I send him a message.

1023
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,731
"But I have to use bait

1024
00:40:19,731 --> 00:40:21,315
"'cause I have to make sure
he'll write me back.

1025
00:40:21,315 --> 00:40:22,859
"So I'm like,
'i think I'm pregnant.'

1026
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:24,861
"he writes back.
'J/k, mother fucker.'

1027
00:40:24,861 --> 00:40:27,614
'but I got you now.'

1028
00:40:27,614 --> 00:40:29,741
"now, we begin
the dance of seduction.

1029
00:40:29,741 --> 00:40:31,618
"Now, I say things,
like, 'i just wanna be friends.

1030
00:40:31,618 --> 00:40:33,202
'You were super fun
to have sex with.

1031
00:40:33,202 --> 00:40:34,704
'Let's just be friends
and have sex.

1032
00:40:34,704 --> 00:40:35,997
'Fuck a relationship
and oxytocin.

1033
00:40:35,997 --> 00:40:37,415
'I never wanna have a family.

1034
00:40:37,415 --> 00:40:39,125
Let's just do
what you wanna do.'

1035
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:41,544
he's into it.
So I get your number, right?

1036
00:40:41,544 --> 00:40:43,504
You hold onto the number
until you have an occasion.

1037
00:40:43,504 --> 00:40:45,381
And then,
it's like St. Patrick's day.

1038
00:40:45,381 --> 00:40:48,009
You send out a mass text,
but it's just to one person.

1039
00:40:48,009 --> 00:40:49,970
You ever do that?

1040
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:54,975
Me neither. It was just a joke.

1041
00:40:54,975 --> 00:40:56,392
It's the best idea.

1042
00:40:56,392 --> 00:40:58,144
You find one guy that you like.

1043
00:40:58,144 --> 00:40:59,854
And you send out a text
that's, like, "hey, everyone."

1044
00:40:59,854 --> 00:41:01,606
Make sure you write
"everyone" in caps

1045
00:41:01,606 --> 00:41:03,524
so it's clear that it's
for, like, a bunch of people.

1046
00:41:03,524 --> 00:41:05,359
"Hey, everyone, I-o-l."

1047
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,029
"Whatever, smiley face,
I'm gonna have a party

1048
00:41:08,029 --> 00:41:09,864
"at Kelly's bar at 9:00 P.M.

1049
00:41:09,864 --> 00:41:11,616
Everybody should come,
you guys."

1050
00:41:11,616 --> 00:41:12,993
Triple "z" so he knows

1051
00:41:12,993 --> 00:41:14,410
there's a lot of people
in this text.

1052
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:15,578
"Okay, see you later."

1053
00:41:15,578 --> 00:41:16,955
And then you bring
your one friend

1054
00:41:16,955 --> 00:41:18,289
that has no issue
with you ditching her.

1055
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:19,499
You go to the bar,
and you post up,

1056
00:41:19,499 --> 00:41:20,584
and you wait
until he gets there.

1057
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:22,002
He shows up.

1058
00:41:22,002 --> 00:41:23,670
You're like,
"I guess everybody passed out.

1059
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,046
It's just us standing."

1060
00:41:25,046 --> 00:41:26,589
And then, you make out.

1061
00:41:26,589 --> 00:41:28,008
And he's, like,
"you seem like a cool chick."

1062
00:41:28,008 --> 00:41:29,133
You're, like,
"I'm the coolest chick.

1063
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:30,635
I wanna fucking do it."

1064
00:41:30,635 --> 00:41:32,178
And he's, like, "let's go out
tomorrow night."

1065
00:41:32,178 --> 00:41:33,554
You're like,
"yeah, a second date.

1066
00:41:33,554 --> 00:41:34,597
"It only took me
six fucking months.

1067
00:41:34,597 --> 00:41:36,307
Yeah."

1068
00:41:36,307 --> 00:41:38,267
So now, you're excited
'cause you have a second date.

1069
00:41:38,267 --> 00:41:39,727
And girls love getting ready
for dates.

1070
00:41:39,727 --> 00:41:41,145
Even though it makes us
a little nauseous

1071
00:41:41,145 --> 00:41:42,271
and all we wanna do
is stay home and eat,

1072
00:41:42,271 --> 00:41:43,857
we love second dates

1073
00:41:43,857 --> 00:41:44,983
'cause you got to get ready
for your second date.

1074
00:41:44,983 --> 00:41:46,275
So what do you do?

1075
00:41:46,275 --> 00:41:47,902
You do your hair,
you do your makeup,

1076
00:41:47,902 --> 00:41:50,947
you shave your big toe.

1077
00:41:54,034 --> 00:41:55,493
You come to play, right?

1078
00:41:55,493 --> 00:41:56,870
Gotta make sure
your underwear's cute.

1079
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,538
Don't wanna go
to Victoria's secret

1080
00:41:58,538 --> 00:42:00,289
'cause that's a bit too much
of a commitment.

1081
00:42:00,289 --> 00:42:03,292
So where do you go for a cheap
bra that's really cute?

1082
00:42:03,292 --> 00:42:06,671
Target.

1083
00:42:06,671 --> 00:42:07,881
They don't fit,
and you're like, "fuck it.

1084
00:42:07,881 --> 00:42:09,465
"For $12.50, I'll wear a bra

1085
00:42:09,465 --> 00:42:11,258
"made of ceiling insulation
and barbed wire.

1086
00:42:11,258 --> 00:42:13,344
That's fine."

1087
00:42:13,344 --> 00:42:14,721
"It doesn't fit this boob,

1088
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:16,014
"and it makes this nipple
fall asleep.

1089
00:42:16,014 --> 00:42:19,183
But for 12 bucks, I'm good."

1090
00:42:19,183 --> 00:42:21,227
You get all excited.
You put on makeup.

1091
00:42:21,227 --> 00:42:23,187
You put on the makeup that
you're okay with sleeping in.

1092
00:42:23,187 --> 00:42:24,981
All girls have
to make this decision

1093
00:42:24,981 --> 00:42:26,816
'cause you know you're not
gonna be washing your face

1094
00:42:26,816 --> 00:42:28,609
because girls are so fucked up
that we think,

1095
00:42:28,609 --> 00:42:30,486
"I'd rather fall asleep,
get night zits,

1096
00:42:30,486 --> 00:42:33,823
"and wake up looking
like a melted clown

1097
00:42:33,823 --> 00:42:36,743
than ever wash my face and show
him that I'm a human being."

1098
00:42:36,743 --> 00:42:38,494
So you go there.
You're all excited.

1099
00:42:38,494 --> 00:42:40,038
You get to his house.
You guys start drinking.

1100
00:42:40,038 --> 00:42:42,498
You get so fucking wasted
in the first two hours

1101
00:42:42,498 --> 00:42:43,875
that you have sex
for three minutes

1102
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:45,043
before he goes completely soft.

1103
00:42:45,043 --> 00:42:46,502
And the next thing you know,

1104
00:42:46,502 --> 00:42:48,212
you wake up in your underwear
on his couch.

1105
00:42:48,212 --> 00:42:49,380
You look over,
he's eating noodles,

1106
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,506
watching "Harry Potter."

1107
00:42:50,506 --> 00:42:52,884
Is this relatable
to anyone else?

1108
00:42:55,929 --> 00:42:57,972
Popular misconception
about girls

1109
00:42:57,972 --> 00:43:00,266
is that we get drunk
and we wanna have sex.

1110
00:43:00,266 --> 00:43:01,809
Here's the truth.

1111
00:43:01,809 --> 00:43:04,062
We do. Have a good night.

1112
00:43:04,062 --> 00:43:06,564
No.

1113
00:43:06,564 --> 00:43:09,901
We do for, like, the first hour
of being drunk, okay?

1114
00:43:09,901 --> 00:43:12,528
Let's talk about the first hour
of being drunk

1115
00:43:12,528 --> 00:43:16,490
mostly because many of you
are in that hour right now.

1116
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:19,326
I call it "the witching hour."

1117
00:43:19,326 --> 00:43:20,787
The first hour of being drunk

1118
00:43:20,787 --> 00:43:22,997
is the best hour of the night

1119
00:43:22,997 --> 00:43:25,374
because your buzz is fresh.

1120
00:43:25,374 --> 00:43:28,044
You're happy.
You don't feel fat.

1121
00:43:28,044 --> 00:43:31,798
You haven't cried yet.

1122
00:43:31,798 --> 00:43:33,133
You're still somewhat
of the self you were

1123
00:43:33,133 --> 00:43:34,634
when you were sober.

1124
00:43:34,634 --> 00:43:37,137
You still could ostensibly
operate heavy machinery

1125
00:43:37,137 --> 00:43:39,806
if an emergency
were to arise, okay?

1126
00:43:39,806 --> 00:43:41,891
You're in that buzz.
You're feeling awesome.

1127
00:43:41,891 --> 00:43:43,684
Your synapses haven't been
soaked in alcohol.

1128
00:43:43,684 --> 00:43:45,686
So you're still alert.
You're feeling awesome.

1129
00:43:45,686 --> 00:43:47,563
You walk into that bar
like you own it.

1130
00:43:47,563 --> 00:43:49,774
You fucking kick that door open
even though it's a pull-in door.

1131
00:43:49,774 --> 00:43:51,192
You don't care. You're just...

1132
00:43:51,192 --> 00:43:52,693
Walk in.

1133
00:43:52,693 --> 00:43:57,198
"Let's do shots, bitches."

1134
00:43:57,198 --> 00:43:58,449
You and your awful friends
line up at the bar.

1135
00:43:58,449 --> 00:43:59,951
Like, "let's do shots."

1136
00:43:59,951 --> 00:44:01,995
You're doing shots
you have no business doing.

1137
00:44:01,995 --> 00:44:04,998
"Let's get Jagermeister,
goldschlager,

1138
00:44:04,998 --> 00:44:06,707
"rumple minze, aftershock.

1139
00:44:06,707 --> 00:44:08,126
"Do you have anything else

1140
00:44:08,126 --> 00:44:10,544
that tastes like Christmas
and vomit?"

1141
00:44:15,508 --> 00:44:17,177
You start doing them.
You're like, "fuck it.

1142
00:44:17,177 --> 00:44:19,095
"It's my bachelorette,
21st birthday,

1143
00:44:19,095 --> 00:44:21,181
"wedding extravaganza,
donkey punch.

1144
00:44:21,181 --> 00:44:22,723
"I don't know what this is...
Do it."

1145
00:44:22,723 --> 00:44:24,600
Shot, shot.

1146
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,394
"What is that, hand soap?
Bubbles. I don't care. Awesome."

1147
00:44:27,394 --> 00:44:28,813
Now, you're on the dance floor.

1148
00:44:28,813 --> 00:44:30,648
You're like, "this is so good."

1149
00:44:30,648 --> 00:44:32,525
And you're feeling so good,
right? You're dancing.

1150
00:44:32,525 --> 00:44:34,235
You're all excited 'cause
your buzz has just hit you.

1151
00:44:34,235 --> 00:44:35,528
You're like, "this is great.
I fucking love it."

1152
00:44:35,528 --> 00:44:37,113
You're ambitious about life.

1153
00:44:37,113 --> 00:44:40,200
You ever plan a workout
when you're drunk?

1154
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,119
When you're drunk, you're, like,
"this is when I get in shape.

1155
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,453
"This is where it starts.

1156
00:44:44,453 --> 00:44:45,663
Going to start tomorrow."

1157
00:44:45,663 --> 00:44:46,789
You try to drag your friends
into it.

1158
00:44:46,789 --> 00:44:49,000
You're like, "Stacy! Sta..."

1159
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,251
"Stacy."

1160
00:44:50,251 --> 00:44:53,629
"Do you wanna work out?

1161
00:44:53,629 --> 00:44:54,964
You dance like an asshole,
by the way.

1162
00:44:54,964 --> 00:44:56,799
I don't know
who dances like this.

1163
00:44:56,799 --> 00:44:58,425
"Do you wanna work out,
like, tomorrow?

1164
00:44:58,425 --> 00:44:59,760
"Do you wanna do that?

1165
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,845
"I'm gonna get up early
and work out.

1166
00:45:00,845 --> 00:45:02,013
"Do you wanna go with me?

1167
00:45:02,013 --> 00:45:03,181
"Do you want to go
at, like, 6:00?

1168
00:45:03,181 --> 00:45:07,351
It's 5:00 now."

1169
00:45:07,351 --> 00:45:09,187
"Do you wanna take
a spin class?"

1170
00:45:09,187 --> 00:45:10,813
"Do you wanna spin?

1171
00:45:10,813 --> 00:45:12,815
"Do you wanna..."

1172
00:45:12,815 --> 00:45:14,108
"Do you want...
You don't wanna spin?

1173
00:45:14,108 --> 00:45:15,651
"You don't wanna go spinning?

1174
00:45:15,651 --> 00:45:17,444
"You don't wanna sit
on a stationary bike

1175
00:45:17,444 --> 00:45:19,822
"and tolerate getting pounded
in the rectum for an hour

1176
00:45:19,822 --> 00:45:22,116
"while some twinked-out
spandex queen yells at you

1177
00:45:22,116 --> 00:45:24,744
"over a shitty remix of U2's
'it's a beautiful day'

1178
00:45:24,744 --> 00:45:26,453
in total darkness?"

1179
00:45:27,621 --> 00:45:29,207
"You don't wanna do that?"

1180
00:45:29,207 --> 00:45:31,125
So you're feeling good
and you're dancing.

1181
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:32,418
You're like, "I feel so thin.

1182
00:45:32,418 --> 00:45:33,753
"I've never been hotter
in my life.

1183
00:45:33,753 --> 00:45:35,713
I feel so good."
And then, it hits you.

1184
00:45:35,713 --> 00:45:39,008
You're like, "oh, my God.
I feel so good right now.

1185
00:45:39,008 --> 00:45:41,302
"I feel so awesome and happy.

1186
00:45:41,302 --> 00:45:43,387
"I wish I could feel this way
all the time.

1187
00:45:43,387 --> 00:45:46,557
I wish I could feel this buzz
and this happy all the time."

1188
00:45:46,557 --> 00:45:49,060
And that's when you realize

1189
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:53,147
that's how an alcoholic thinks.

1190
00:45:53,147 --> 00:45:54,941
But you're, like, "screw it.
I'm gonna give it a shot.

1191
00:45:54,941 --> 00:45:58,236
I'm gonna see just how far
I can push being drunk."

1192
00:45:58,236 --> 00:45:59,820
So you decide to do shots.

1193
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,989
And you decide,
"these shots aren't gonna get me

1194
00:46:01,989 --> 00:46:06,452
'cause tonight's the night
I outsmart the liquor."

1195
00:46:06,452 --> 00:46:09,914
"Not gonna happen tonight
'cause I'm gonna drink water.

1196
00:46:09,914 --> 00:46:11,707
Going to drink a glass of water
with each shot."

1197
00:46:11,707 --> 00:46:13,500
And this is your brilliant idea.

1198
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,545
No one in the thousands of years
of people imbibing alcohol

1199
00:46:16,545 --> 00:46:17,630
has ever thought of this.

1200
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:19,381
This is your night, Einstein.

1201
00:46:19,381 --> 00:46:21,425
It's your big plan.

1202
00:46:21,425 --> 00:46:23,761
"I'm gonna do a shot
and then have a glass of water,

1203
00:46:23,761 --> 00:46:25,512
"and then a shot,
and then a glass of water.

1204
00:46:25,512 --> 00:46:27,307
"You can't buy me a shot now,
but thank you.

1205
00:46:27,307 --> 00:46:29,142
I'm just having water."

1206
00:46:29,142 --> 00:46:30,601
"I'm just having..."

1207
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:32,937
"I'm just drinking water,
but thank you."

1208
00:46:32,937 --> 00:46:35,022
Shot and water,
but what you don't realize

1209
00:46:35,022 --> 00:46:36,440
is that five shots in an hour

1210
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:40,361
is still five fucking shots
in an hour.

1211
00:46:40,361 --> 00:46:43,072
You went and drank all
that water like a crazy camel.

1212
00:46:43,072 --> 00:46:44,448
Yeah, good job.
Now, you're bloated.

1213
00:46:44,448 --> 00:46:46,659
And you have to pee. Way to be.

1214
00:46:46,659 --> 00:46:48,077
'Cause when a girl's gotta pee,

1215
00:46:48,077 --> 00:46:50,037
everything has to come
to a halt.

1216
00:46:50,037 --> 00:46:51,372
Every girl's gotta go with her.

1217
00:46:51,372 --> 00:46:53,833
"I have to pee.
Do you have to pee?"

1218
00:46:56,336 --> 00:47:00,589
"I can't go alone. No.

1219
00:47:00,589 --> 00:47:02,258
"Will you stop what you're doing
and come with me?

1220
00:47:02,258 --> 00:47:03,968
"I have to pee.
Do you have to pee?

1221
00:47:03,968 --> 00:47:06,387
"I have to pee.
I have to go pee."

1222
00:47:12,101 --> 00:47:14,228
Can't go in the bathroom alone.

1223
00:47:14,228 --> 00:47:16,814
You might not come back.

1224
00:47:16,814 --> 00:47:18,399
'Cause no girl's ever been

1225
00:47:18,399 --> 00:47:21,194
to the bathroom alone
and survived.

1226
00:47:21,194 --> 00:47:23,196
It's true.

1227
00:47:23,196 --> 00:47:25,239
The last woman
that attempted it,

1228
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:27,867
it was 1937...

1229
00:47:27,867 --> 00:47:31,245
And her name was Amelia earhart.

1230
00:47:38,002 --> 00:47:39,503
It's a big event.

1231
00:47:39,503 --> 00:47:41,339
"I have to pee.
Come on. Let's go.

1232
00:47:41,339 --> 00:47:42,673
"Every girl, let's go,
you girls.

1233
00:47:42,673 --> 00:47:44,175
"Come on.
I have to pee, come on.

1234
00:47:44,175 --> 00:47:45,676
"Take my hand.
Let's make a chain of whores.

1235
00:47:45,676 --> 00:47:46,969
Everyone holds hands."

1236
00:47:46,969 --> 00:47:48,554
As they walk into the bathroom.

1237
00:47:48,554 --> 00:47:51,265
For me, when I'm walking
through a crowded bar,

1238
00:47:51,265 --> 00:47:53,767
the amount of aggression
I will display

1239
00:47:53,767 --> 00:47:56,562
toward the other bar patrons
is in direct correlation

1240
00:47:56,562 --> 00:47:58,856
with how many boys
I've gotten to flirt with.

1241
00:47:58,856 --> 00:48:01,775
Meaning if I haven't gotten
to talk to any cute guys,

1242
00:48:01,775 --> 00:48:03,569
mama's gonna be
a little aggressive

1243
00:48:03,569 --> 00:48:05,738
in her walk
to the bathroom, okay?

1244
00:48:05,738 --> 00:48:07,656
Guys, when they get drunk,
sometimes punch walls.

1245
00:48:07,656 --> 00:48:09,116
I like to mule kick other girls
in the shin.

1246
00:48:09,116 --> 00:48:10,701
It's totally fine.

1247
00:48:10,701 --> 00:48:11,952
Every girl's done this.
And you know why we do it?

1248
00:48:11,952 --> 00:48:13,620
'Cause we can get away with it.

1249
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:15,248
You can knock into a girl
and then be, like, "oops.

1250
00:48:15,248 --> 00:48:16,874
I didn't mean that."

1251
00:48:19,043 --> 00:48:20,669
Our smile
is our jedi mind trick.

1252
00:48:20,669 --> 00:48:23,630
Just, "these are not the droids
you're looking for."

1253
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:26,092
You ever do that?

1254
00:48:26,092 --> 00:48:27,718
You ever just check a girl
into the boards 'cause you can?

1255
00:48:27,718 --> 00:48:29,220
You ever just been walking,
and just been, like...

1256
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,180
"I love your shoes. Oops."

1257
00:48:34,183 --> 00:48:35,684
Takes you forever,
but you finally get through

1258
00:48:35,684 --> 00:48:36,810
that jungle of people.

1259
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:37,978
You get to the bathroom.

1260
00:48:37,978 --> 00:48:39,646
For those of you
that haven't been

1261
00:48:39,646 --> 00:48:41,357
in a women's restroom
late night,

1262
00:48:41,357 --> 00:48:43,692
a women's restroom late night

1263
00:48:43,692 --> 00:48:46,362
looks like a scene out of
"apocalypse now."

1264
00:48:47,905 --> 00:48:50,283
There's gunfire, explosions,

1265
00:48:50,283 --> 00:48:52,452
blood everywhere, children,

1266
00:48:52,452 --> 00:48:55,121
a lot of vietnamese men,
which I never quite understood,

1267
00:48:55,121 --> 00:48:56,163
like, why they'd be there.

1268
00:48:56,163 --> 00:48:57,457
You're with your buddies

1269
00:48:57,457 --> 00:48:59,166
just trying
to get through everything.

1270
00:48:59,166 --> 00:49:01,001
You go pee. You get to the sink.

1271
00:49:01,001 --> 00:49:04,088
And then, your night comes
to a screeching halt

1272
00:49:04,088 --> 00:49:07,341
'cause for the first time
in, like, four hours,

1273
00:49:07,341 --> 00:49:09,385
you get a look at yourself
in the mirror.

1274
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:18,936
And you see the swamp witch
that you've become.

1275
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,400
Ten minutes ago, you thought
you looked like Heidi Klum.

1276
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,610
It turns out you look like seal.

1277
00:49:34,618 --> 00:49:36,578
It hits you like a ton of bricks
out of nowhere.

1278
00:49:36,578 --> 00:49:38,164
And you don't know it's coming.

1279
00:49:38,164 --> 00:49:39,499
You're sitting there
talking to your friends.

1280
00:49:39,499 --> 00:49:41,250
You're like, "this is awesome.

1281
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:45,629
- " I'm gonna be young forever.
- This is..."

1282
00:49:45,629 --> 00:49:48,466
"No! What? What is this?

1283
00:49:48,466 --> 00:49:52,136
I was once a great beauty."

1284
00:49:52,136 --> 00:49:54,888
"No.

1285
00:49:54,888 --> 00:49:57,391
What is this?"

1286
00:49:57,391 --> 00:49:58,767
You go to touch it.
It disappears.

1287
00:49:58,767 --> 00:50:00,186
You're, like...

1288
00:50:00,186 --> 00:50:01,979
"Is it a hologram? What is that?

1289
00:50:01,979 --> 00:50:03,105
I look weird."

1290
00:50:03,105 --> 00:50:05,024
One eyeball has migrated here.

1291
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,986
You look down.
You're just leaking vodka.

1292
00:50:11,238 --> 00:50:13,533
Now, you don't wanna hook up
with anyone.

1293
00:50:13,533 --> 00:50:18,412
Now, all you wanna do is eat.

1294
00:50:18,412 --> 00:50:20,164
I'm a red-blooded American girl.

1295
00:50:20,164 --> 00:50:22,208
Absolutely, when I get drunk,
I would rather eat

1296
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:23,334
than hook up with you.

1297
00:50:23,334 --> 00:50:26,086
I'm sorry. I don't know.

1298
00:50:26,086 --> 00:50:28,297
Give you a hand job
or go get fries?

1299
00:50:39,392 --> 00:50:41,143
Both are salty.
One will give me carpal tunnel.

1300
00:50:41,143 --> 00:50:44,313
I'll go with the fries.
Every time.

1301
00:50:46,773 --> 00:50:48,275
A popular misconception
about girls

1302
00:50:48,275 --> 00:50:49,402
is that we don't like to eat.

1303
00:50:49,402 --> 00:50:52,530
Girls love to eat. Yeah.

1304
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:54,198
We just don't like to eat
in front of a guy that we like.

1305
00:50:54,198 --> 00:50:55,575
That's the difference.

1306
00:50:55,575 --> 00:50:57,117
When you first meet a guy
that you like,

1307
00:50:57,117 --> 00:50:58,911
you can't eat the way
you want to on a date.

1308
00:50:58,911 --> 00:51:00,580
You can't.

1309
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:02,789
You can't have that fourth plate
of ribs on a date...

1310
00:51:05,626 --> 00:51:10,005
I found out.

1311
00:51:10,005 --> 00:51:11,090
Going on a date,
society dictates

1312
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:12,216
that guys can do what they want

1313
00:51:12,216 --> 00:51:13,509
and women have to be dainty.

1314
00:51:13,509 --> 00:51:15,844
So he's gonna get fries,
a burger,

1315
00:51:15,844 --> 00:51:18,805
half a gazelle,
whatever he wants to eat.

1316
00:51:18,805 --> 00:51:20,766
Girls, you get the menu,
what are you ordering?

1317
00:51:20,766 --> 00:51:23,102
- All: Salad.
- Salad.

1318
00:51:23,102 --> 00:51:29,733
Like hot little robots. Salad.

1319
00:51:29,733 --> 00:51:31,611
And it's
an excruciating experience

1320
00:51:31,611 --> 00:51:33,153
'cause you're trying to just
look pretty the whole time.

1321
00:51:33,153 --> 00:51:34,405
He's sitting there
enjoying his burger.

1322
00:51:34,405 --> 00:51:35,906
You're eating your lettuce.

1323
00:51:35,906 --> 00:51:37,157
You're just sitting there
going, "ugh."

1324
00:51:37,157 --> 00:51:38,951
You've abandoned the utensils.

1325
00:51:38,951 --> 00:51:40,994
You ordered, like, a koala.
You may as well eat like one.

1326
00:51:40,994 --> 00:51:42,079
You're just, like...

1327
00:51:49,128 --> 00:51:50,796
He's talking.

1328
00:51:50,796 --> 00:51:52,423
You can't focus
'cause you're starving, right?

1329
00:51:52,423 --> 00:51:53,924
He's yapping.
You're just, like...

1330
00:51:53,924 --> 00:51:55,342
You finished your lettuce.

1331
00:51:55,342 --> 00:51:56,885
There's no more watercress
on the plate.

1332
00:51:56,885 --> 00:51:58,262
You're just... You pull one...

1333
00:51:58,262 --> 00:51:59,680
You're looking at his food.

1334
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,889
You're, like,
"what's that over there?

1335
00:52:00,889 --> 00:52:02,558
Fry."

1336
00:52:02,558 --> 00:52:05,269
Talking, talking. You can't
focus. You can't focus.

1337
00:52:05,269 --> 00:52:07,020
You're not getting any
nutrients to your brain.

1338
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:09,064
You're just kind of staring out
the window,

1339
00:52:09,064 --> 00:52:10,608
wondering what birds taste like.

1340
00:52:10,608 --> 00:52:12,859
You're just, like...

1341
00:52:12,859 --> 00:52:14,945
You finished your lemon wedge,
like, an hour ago.

1342
00:52:14,945 --> 00:52:16,572
He's still eating.
He's still talking.

1343
00:52:16,572 --> 00:52:18,324
And you're... you're starting
to get cold now.

1344
00:52:18,324 --> 00:52:20,409
You're not getting any nutrition
into your bloodstream.

1345
00:52:20,409 --> 00:52:22,202
Your spine is sticking out.
You're shivering.

1346
00:52:22,202 --> 00:52:23,787
You start...
You're like a lost puppy.

1347
00:52:23,787 --> 00:52:25,998
You start saying things
that you don't mean.

1348
00:52:25,998 --> 00:52:27,833
He's yapping. You start
just saying things, like,

1349
00:52:27,833 --> 00:52:29,835
"I would love to spend
the afternoon with your mother.

1350
00:52:29,835 --> 00:52:32,379
"That sounds great.
And no, I totally cared

1351
00:52:32,379 --> 00:52:34,089
"about that whole replacement
refs thing.

1352
00:52:34,089 --> 00:52:39,011
It really rocked my world
as well."

1353
00:52:39,011 --> 00:52:40,304
Once you're in a relationship,

1354
00:52:40,304 --> 00:52:42,556
you can eat the way you want to.

1355
00:52:42,556 --> 00:52:44,684
Once he loves you, you can roll
out a trough at mealtime.

1356
00:52:44,684 --> 00:52:46,059
It doesn't matter.

1357
00:52:46,059 --> 00:52:47,436
You can put your hands behind
your back,

1358
00:52:47,436 --> 00:52:49,313
county fair
pie-eating-contest-style.

1359
00:52:51,565 --> 00:52:53,150
"I love you.
Is that the house cat?"

1360
00:52:55,611 --> 00:52:57,779
Yeah, you can let it all
hang out when he loves you.

1361
00:52:57,779 --> 00:53:00,073
Then, you can show him
how you eat.

1362
00:53:00,073 --> 00:53:01,908
Once you're in love,
you can show him

1363
00:53:01,908 --> 00:53:05,287
the 12-foot man-eating lizard
you actually are.

1364
00:53:20,386 --> 00:53:23,263
Your eyes light up red.
Vwoom, vwoom.

1365
00:53:23,263 --> 00:53:26,308
"Let's get cheesecake."

1366
00:53:26,308 --> 00:53:28,227
"Oh, cool, sweetheart.

1367
00:53:28,227 --> 00:53:29,936
You wanna share
a piece of cheesecake?"

1368
00:53:29,936 --> 00:53:32,189
"Uh-uh."

1369
00:53:32,189 --> 00:53:35,150
Tail swipe.

1370
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:39,988
"Get your own."

1371
00:53:44,785 --> 00:53:46,537
"All right, sweetheart.
Dinner's over.

1372
00:53:46,537 --> 00:53:48,539
Did you get enough to eat?"
I love when they ask that

1373
00:53:48,539 --> 00:53:50,499
'cause I've always wanted
to give this answer.

1374
00:53:50,499 --> 00:53:53,293
"Did you get enough to eat?"

1375
00:53:56,838 --> 00:54:00,133
"Uh-uh."

1376
00:54:00,133 --> 00:54:01,885
"Why? What else do you want?"

1377
00:54:01,885 --> 00:54:03,970
"Your soul!

1378
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:04,470
Fire!"

1379
00:54:15,357 --> 00:54:17,818
Can I ask you...
Can I ask you a question?

1380
00:54:19,612 --> 00:54:21,280
Does this tail
make my butt look big?

1381
00:54:36,754 --> 00:54:38,964
Girls love eating. We do.

1382
00:54:38,964 --> 00:54:40,424
We were the first ones
to make it fun.

1383
00:54:40,424 --> 00:54:42,008
Hello? Apple? Garden of eden.

1384
00:54:42,008 --> 00:54:43,761
Mm-hmm.

1385
00:54:43,761 --> 00:54:45,471
Girls love to eat.

1386
00:54:45,471 --> 00:54:47,640
I saw a bachelorette party
take down a live buffalo

1387
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,433
at 35 Miles an hour
off the freeway.

1388
00:54:49,433 --> 00:54:51,393
It was magnificent.

1389
00:54:51,393 --> 00:54:52,812
The girls ran alongside it.

1390
00:54:52,812 --> 00:54:55,439
Like, "Stacy put your veil
over his snout."

1391
00:54:58,150 --> 00:54:59,526
You ever tried
to get a group of drunk girls

1392
00:54:59,526 --> 00:55:03,614
to walk from a bar
to a restaurant?

1393
00:55:03,614 --> 00:55:06,533
It's like herding drunk,
retarded sheep.

1394
00:55:08,243 --> 00:55:10,329
First of all, yes,
I love being a woman.

1395
00:55:10,329 --> 00:55:12,038
We're amazing. I love Beyonce.

1396
00:55:12,038 --> 00:55:14,625
But we have no idea
where we're going.

1397
00:55:14,625 --> 00:55:16,752
Okay? We're walking around.

1398
00:55:16,752 --> 00:55:19,087
All we know is that we got
little sheep hooves on

1399
00:55:19,087 --> 00:55:22,842
and we're freezing
because no one brought a jacket.

1400
00:55:24,718 --> 00:55:26,178
Just walking forever, no clue.

1401
00:55:26,178 --> 00:55:27,554
"I'm cold. I'm cold."

1402
00:55:27,554 --> 00:55:29,055
"Why didn't you bring a jacket?"

1403
00:55:29,055 --> 00:55:31,266
"'Cause I'm in my 20s
and I'm stupid."

1404
00:55:33,477 --> 00:55:34,687
"I'm cold."

1405
00:55:34,687 --> 00:55:36,146
"I have to pee. I'm cold."

1406
00:55:36,146 --> 00:55:38,023
"I have to pee.
I don't have solutions.

1407
00:55:38,023 --> 00:55:39,650
Just more problems."

1408
00:55:43,696 --> 00:55:44,864
Everybody's got
that one girlfriend

1409
00:55:44,864 --> 00:55:46,281
that's a little filthy.

1410
00:55:46,281 --> 00:55:49,242
She has no issue
with peeing behind a dumpster.

1411
00:55:49,242 --> 00:55:51,036
It holds everyone up.

1412
00:55:51,036 --> 00:55:52,705
You're all trying to walk
and she's back there.

1413
00:55:52,705 --> 00:55:56,124
She's, like...

1414
00:55:56,124 --> 00:55:58,335
"You guys!"

1415
00:55:58,335 --> 00:55:59,419
"Wa-a-a-ait."

1416
00:56:02,464 --> 00:56:04,675
"Wait, no, make sure
nobody's watching."

1417
00:56:06,009 --> 00:56:07,803
You're sitting there
running interference

1418
00:56:07,803 --> 00:56:10,096
for your friend, like,
"don't look at her sheep vagina.

1419
00:56:10,096 --> 00:56:11,765
Just mine."

1420
00:56:11,765 --> 00:56:13,600
I promise you nobody's watching.

1421
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,935
I promise you.

1422
00:56:14,935 --> 00:56:16,770
I promise you
no guy is driving by,

1423
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:18,731
like, "ugh, well,
tonight really sucks.

1424
00:56:18,731 --> 00:56:19,857
"And I..."

1425
00:56:19,857 --> 00:56:22,902
"Whoa."

1426
00:56:22,902 --> 00:56:25,153
"Is that a drunk girl
peeing on hot garbage?"

1427
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:28,574
"That's awesome."

1428
00:56:28,574 --> 00:56:29,742
"Oh, what am I doing?

1429
00:56:29,742 --> 00:56:31,410
I got to get
to the craft store."

1430
00:56:38,166 --> 00:56:41,587
Oh.

1431
00:56:41,587 --> 00:56:44,130
So she's... she's done peeing.
You're all wandering.

1432
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:45,340
Now, you're
into the second hour.

1433
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,842
You're still drunk somehow.

1434
00:56:46,842 --> 00:56:49,177
You're cold, you're hungry,
and you...

1435
00:56:49,177 --> 00:56:50,637
Everybody's got
that one girlfriend

1436
00:56:50,637 --> 00:56:52,097
that has a poor moral barometer.

1437
00:56:52,097 --> 00:56:54,683
She'll get in a car
with any guy...

1438
00:56:54,683 --> 00:56:57,227
As long as it looks warm.

1439
00:56:57,227 --> 00:56:59,396
And she'll rationalize
why he's not a rapist

1440
00:56:59,396 --> 00:57:01,440
based solely on the way
that he's dressed.

1441
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,358
Every girl's
had to do this, right?

1442
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:04,818
You have to make these, like,
game-time decisions.

1443
00:57:04,818 --> 00:57:06,236
You're, like,
"he's not gonna rape me.

1444
00:57:06,236 --> 00:57:08,405
He's wearing nike dunks."

1445
00:57:08,405 --> 00:57:09,573
"Guys, come over here."

1446
00:57:09,573 --> 00:57:10,950
Your friend goes over
to the guy.

1447
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:12,910
She bends down
like a streetwalker.

1448
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:14,244
She's, like,
"hi, what's your name?

1449
00:57:14,244 --> 00:57:16,121
"Todd? Oh, that's a fun name.

1450
00:57:16,121 --> 00:57:18,248
"That's a really exotic name.
Oh, you'll give us a ride?

1451
00:57:18,248 --> 00:57:20,292
Okay, that's really fun.
My name is crystal."

1452
00:57:20,292 --> 00:57:21,418
"Nice to meet you.

1453
00:57:21,418 --> 00:57:23,754
"Hold on a second. You guys!

1454
00:57:23,754 --> 00:57:25,255
He's gonna give us a ride."

1455
00:57:25,255 --> 00:57:27,507
"He's gonna give us a ride."

1456
00:57:27,507 --> 00:57:28,968
"Do you wanna go with him?"
Your friends know better.

1457
00:57:28,968 --> 00:57:30,510
They're on the other side
of the street

1458
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:32,846
huddled together,
like, "crystal, get away."

1459
00:57:35,766 --> 00:57:39,853
"We're not... get... he's not..."

1460
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:45,066
Crystal's stupid,
and she's already...

1461
00:57:45,066 --> 00:57:46,735
She's, like,
"hold on one second.

1462
00:57:46,735 --> 00:57:48,946
"Thank you so much.
I really like your chin strap.

1463
00:57:48,946 --> 00:57:51,657
It's really attractive."

1464
00:57:51,657 --> 00:57:52,616
"Hold on one second. Hold on.

1465
00:57:52,616 --> 00:57:53,784
"Let me... you guys!

1466
00:57:53,784 --> 00:57:55,118
"He's gonna give us a ride.

1467
00:57:55,118 --> 00:57:57,037
"Like, do you wanna just
keep walking?

1468
00:57:57,037 --> 00:57:59,289
Sarah, you're being a bitch."

1469
00:57:59,289 --> 00:58:00,457
"You are... like, we talked
about this earlier

1470
00:58:00,457 --> 00:58:02,125
"when you were in the bathroom.

1471
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:03,627
"You're being... this is,
like, what we talked about.

1472
00:58:03,627 --> 00:58:05,004
"You're being a...
Do you not wanna...

1473
00:58:05,004 --> 00:58:06,254
"you don't wanna go with him?

1474
00:58:06,254 --> 00:58:07,547
"You guy... hold on one second.

1475
00:58:07,547 --> 00:58:08,715
"Thank you so much.
Hold on one...

1476
00:58:08,715 --> 00:58:10,300
"okay, hold on. Hold on a sec.

1477
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:11,635
"You guys, he's gonna give us...
He's being nice.

1478
00:58:11,635 --> 00:58:13,261
"Stop it. Stop it.

1479
00:58:13,261 --> 00:58:16,264
He's not... he's not...
He's not gonna rape us."

1480
00:58:18,308 --> 00:58:20,310
"He's not gonna rape us."

1481
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:23,396
You have to whisper
the rape part.

1482
00:58:23,396 --> 00:58:24,898
Just in case
that was his intention,

1483
00:58:24,898 --> 00:58:27,026
you don't want to offend him
ahead of time.

1484
00:58:29,736 --> 00:58:31,613
God forbid you offend him
and he leaves.

1485
00:58:31,613 --> 00:58:33,740
Oh, no. Then what?

1486
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:37,577
"He's not gonna rape us.
He's wearing skechers."

1487
00:58:37,577 --> 00:58:40,622
That's fair.

1488
00:58:40,622 --> 00:58:42,041
Now, you're into hour three.

1489
00:58:42,041 --> 00:58:44,001
You didn't take the ride
from chin strap.

1490
00:58:44,001 --> 00:58:46,086
So you're walking. You're cold.

1491
00:58:46,086 --> 00:58:47,587
No one knows where they're going

1492
00:58:47,587 --> 00:58:50,883
'cause you're all relying
on girl GPS.

1493
00:58:50,883 --> 00:58:52,509
For those of you
that don't know,

1494
00:58:52,509 --> 00:58:56,013
girl GPS pretty much consists
of one girl doing this:

1495
00:58:56,013 --> 00:58:56,513
"Um..."

1496
00:59:04,021 --> 00:59:05,689
"I feel like it's this way."

1497
00:59:17,617 --> 00:59:19,036
Girls, when you get drunk,

1498
00:59:19,036 --> 00:59:21,204
who are you most likely
to pick a fight with?

1499
00:59:21,204 --> 00:59:22,372
Your boyfriend.

1500
00:59:22,372 --> 00:59:23,874
Do you wanna know why?

1501
00:59:23,874 --> 00:59:25,595
'Cause you know
he's not gonna hit you back.

1502
00:59:26,919 --> 00:59:28,921
Every girl in here knows
that your boyfriend

1503
00:59:28,921 --> 00:59:30,672
will take a healthy dose
of your drunk ranting.

1504
00:59:30,672 --> 00:59:32,883
Why?

1505
00:59:32,883 --> 00:59:34,300
'Cause at the end of the night
when you're all tuckered out,

1506
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,719
he's gonna want
to mouth-kiss you

1507
00:59:35,719 --> 00:59:38,972
and touch your snootch,
that's why.

1508
00:59:38,972 --> 00:59:40,807
I hate to tell you
it's why they do everything.

1509
00:59:40,807 --> 00:59:42,434
It's why they put up
with your attitude.

1510
00:59:42,434 --> 00:59:44,352
It's why they buy you
expensive drinks.

1511
00:59:44,352 --> 00:59:46,146
It's why they let you make them
turn the game off

1512
00:59:46,146 --> 00:59:48,107
so you can show them
what you did on pinterest.

1513
00:59:48,107 --> 00:59:51,068
Okay? For snootches.

1514
00:59:52,945 --> 00:59:55,155
"Steve, come here.
Come look at this.

1515
00:59:55,155 --> 00:59:57,616
"No, like, off.
Like, turn it off.

1516
00:59:57,616 --> 00:59:58,992
"Don't p...
Just, like, shut it off.

1517
00:59:58,992 --> 01:00:00,285
"I wanna show you something.
Come here.

1518
01:00:00,285 --> 01:00:02,829
Come here. Come here."

1519
01:00:02,829 --> 01:00:04,873
"Look, look what I have.
Look what I pinned.

1520
01:00:04,873 --> 01:00:06,416
"Look at this.

1521
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:11,046
It's an entire wedding
made of cheese."

1522
01:00:11,046 --> 01:00:14,466
"It can be our wedding."

1523
01:00:14,466 --> 01:00:18,929
"Steven?"

1524
01:00:18,929 --> 01:00:20,305
I call it a "snootch"

1525
01:00:20,305 --> 01:00:23,433
'cause I don't like
the word "vagina."

1526
01:00:23,433 --> 01:00:25,351
No one says "vagina."

1527
01:00:25,351 --> 01:00:27,646
Like, no one says that.
That's weird.

1528
01:00:27,646 --> 01:00:29,064
No one here has ever been
hooking up with someone

1529
01:00:29,064 --> 01:00:30,231
and been, like,
"this feels great.

1530
01:00:30,231 --> 01:00:32,151
Continue to touch my vagina."

1531
01:00:33,401 --> 01:00:34,694
Vagina? What?

1532
01:00:34,694 --> 01:00:37,197
A vagina sounds
like an Indian casino.

1533
01:00:40,075 --> 01:00:43,078
"This weekend at vagina..."

1534
01:00:43,078 --> 01:00:47,040
"Wayne Newton at vagina."

1535
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,459
I made up "snootch"
'cause it's so cute-sounding.

1536
01:00:49,459 --> 01:00:52,295
Snootch.

1537
01:00:52,295 --> 01:00:54,173
Snootch.

1538
01:00:54,173 --> 01:00:56,257
Maybe it would be,
like, a cartoon character.

1539
01:00:56,257 --> 01:00:58,760
Maybe it would be,
like, a cute, tiny,

1540
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:02,681
furry... obviously... character.

1541
01:01:02,681 --> 01:01:05,058
It's got a little top hat.

1542
01:01:05,058 --> 01:01:06,601
And maybe before you have sex,

1543
01:01:06,601 --> 01:01:07,936
you have to summon snootch

1544
01:01:07,936 --> 01:01:10,480
so he can bless the whole thing.

1545
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,982
Yeah, that's what
you have to do.

1546
01:01:11,982 --> 01:01:13,399
You're having...
You're about to have sex.

1547
01:01:13,399 --> 01:01:15,152
You have to get out
a snootch flute

1548
01:01:15,152 --> 01:01:16,319
which you have to preorder.

1549
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,363
You have to order them online.

1550
01:01:18,363 --> 01:01:20,406
It's a... it's a dot-gov site.

1551
01:01:20,406 --> 01:01:22,075
You pull it out.

1552
01:01:22,075 --> 01:01:23,743
You're, like,
"you ready to have sex?"

1553
01:01:23,743 --> 01:01:26,038
"Sure, let's... let's...
Let's summon snootch."

1554
01:01:26,038 --> 01:01:27,288
"Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

1555
01:01:27,288 --> 01:01:27,900
Snootch!"

1556
01:01:32,335 --> 01:01:33,753
"Hi, folks." "Hi, snootch.

1557
01:01:33,753 --> 01:01:34,838
"We were just about to have sex.

1558
01:01:34,838 --> 01:01:35,881
Do we have your blessing?"

1559
01:01:35,881 --> 01:01:37,049
"Well, you surely do.

1560
01:01:37,049 --> 01:01:38,217
"It was nice meeting
both of you,

1561
01:01:38,217 --> 01:01:39,592
"but I better be on my way.

1562
01:01:39,592 --> 01:01:40,844
"Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

1563
01:01:40,844 --> 01:01:44,181
Snootch!"

1564
01:01:44,181 --> 01:01:46,892
So cute.

1565
01:01:46,892 --> 01:01:48,768
I made up "snootch"
'cause I don't like the p-word.

1566
01:01:48,768 --> 01:01:50,812
I don't like saying it.
It's not a lady word.

1567
01:01:50,812 --> 01:01:53,065
Pussy.

1568
01:01:53,065 --> 01:01:54,649
If I got to say it,
there's gonna be

1569
01:01:54,649 --> 01:01:56,735
an involuntary facial spasm
that comes with it.

1570
01:01:56,735 --> 01:01:58,028
You should know that.

1571
01:01:58,028 --> 01:01:59,529
I will ruin any sort of moment

1572
01:01:59,529 --> 01:02:01,156
we have going in the bedroom.

1573
01:02:01,156 --> 01:02:02,532
"All right, babe. This is great.

1574
01:02:02,532 --> 01:02:04,117
Tell me where you want me
to put it."

1575
01:02:04,117 --> 01:02:06,119
"I'll say it,
but you're not gonna like it."

1576
01:02:09,581 --> 01:02:11,750
"Come on. Where do you
want me to put it?"

1577
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:14,127
"Why don't you put it
in my pussy!"

1578
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:20,092
"I can't." "What'd you say?"

1579
01:02:20,092 --> 01:02:21,760
"Nothing. I'm fine, I'm fine."

1580
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:22,886
"All right. Let's do this."

1581
01:02:22,886 --> 01:02:23,929
"Great." "All right, come on.

1582
01:02:23,929 --> 01:02:25,346
"Let's get back to it.

1583
01:02:25,346 --> 01:02:26,806
All right, where do you
want me to put it?"

1584
01:02:26,806 --> 01:02:28,934
"Why don't you put it
in my pussy!"

1585
01:02:28,934 --> 01:02:31,853
"No!"

1586
01:02:31,853 --> 01:02:34,564
It's not a lady word.
Ladies don't say that word.

1587
01:02:34,564 --> 01:02:36,316
Like, growing up,
did your mom ever say,

1588
01:02:36,316 --> 01:02:37,317
"pussy, you need to shower?"

1589
01:02:37,317 --> 01:02:38,902
No, she didn't, right?

1590
01:02:38,902 --> 01:02:42,281
No, and if she did,
then your mom was white trash.

1591
01:02:45,491 --> 01:02:47,119
It's not a lady word.

1592
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:49,829
It's not a word that women hear
independent of men.

1593
01:02:49,829 --> 01:02:52,791
Most women don't hear that word,
like, in professional ether.

1594
01:02:52,791 --> 01:02:55,418
No woman's laying there
at the gynecologist.

1595
01:02:55,418 --> 01:02:56,753
Doctor walks in, he's, like...

1596
01:02:56,753 --> 01:02:58,922
"What's up?"

1597
01:02:58,922 --> 01:03:02,259
"How's it hangin'?
All right, let's see.

1598
01:03:02,259 --> 01:03:07,597
Pussy checks out all right."

1599
01:03:07,597 --> 01:03:09,141
"Great tits, by the way.
Good hustle.

1600
01:03:09,141 --> 01:03:13,228
Get outta here."

1601
01:03:16,481 --> 01:03:18,066
It's... it's a guy word.

1602
01:03:18,066 --> 01:03:19,776
I don't care that guys say it.

1603
01:03:19,776 --> 01:03:21,987
Boys are gross, and that's
why we love them, okay?

1604
01:03:21,987 --> 01:03:23,446
But that's a guy thing.

1605
01:03:23,446 --> 01:03:25,324
That's what guys say
in the locker rooms

1606
01:03:25,324 --> 01:03:27,408
with... with...
With all their grossness.

1607
01:03:27,408 --> 01:03:28,994
I'd imagine they go
to the locker room

1608
01:03:28,994 --> 01:03:31,079
after a rousing game
of touch softball,

1609
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:32,372
and they talk about the p-word.

1610
01:03:32,372 --> 01:03:34,499
"Hey, what's up? What's up, bro?

1611
01:03:34,499 --> 01:03:36,084
"What's up? Did you get any...

1612
01:03:36,084 --> 01:03:37,210
Did you get any pussy
last night?"

1613
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:38,378
"Yeah, a whole bucket."

1614
01:03:38,378 --> 01:03:43,383
I don't know
how you quantify it.

1615
01:03:43,383 --> 01:03:45,718
I don't know if it goes bucket,
mug, ramekin.

1616
01:03:45,718 --> 01:03:47,679
I don't know.

1617
01:03:47,679 --> 01:03:49,973
But that's what guys do
in the locker rooms

1618
01:03:49,973 --> 01:03:51,891
with the butt slaps
and the sword fighting.

1619
01:03:51,891 --> 01:03:55,603
That's what they do.

1620
01:03:55,603 --> 01:03:57,147
We know about that.

1621
01:03:57,147 --> 01:03:58,690
We know you do weird things
with each other

1622
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:00,233
with your wieners
'cause you do weird things

1623
01:04:00,233 --> 01:04:01,943
with us, and you're trying
to impress us.

1624
01:04:01,943 --> 01:04:05,530
So I can only imagine
what creepiness

1625
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:07,199
goes on behind closed doors.

1626
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:09,326
I've seen it firsthand.

1627
01:04:09,326 --> 01:04:10,618
Every girl has.

1628
01:04:10,618 --> 01:04:12,037
Every girl's had that boyfriend

1629
01:04:12,037 --> 01:04:13,663
where you're sitting on the bed

1630
01:04:13,663 --> 01:04:15,374
in your target
underwear waiting.

1631
01:04:15,374 --> 01:04:17,667
He comes out
of the bathroom naked

1632
01:04:17,667 --> 01:04:19,085
except for a t-shirt.

1633
01:04:19,085 --> 01:04:23,006
No bottoms,
Donald ducking it the whole way.

1634
01:04:31,764 --> 01:04:33,141
He's got this grin on his face.

1635
01:04:33,141 --> 01:04:35,476
And he's just, like, "hey, babe.

1636
01:04:35,476 --> 01:04:38,938
Babe, check this out."

1637
01:04:44,027 --> 01:04:47,155
Why are you doing that?

1638
01:04:47,155 --> 01:04:50,367
On behalf of all women, why?

1639
01:04:50,367 --> 01:04:54,246
It's never gonna change
a girl's mind, ever.

1640
01:04:54,246 --> 01:04:55,538
You are not helping yourself.

1641
01:04:55,538 --> 01:04:57,374
No woman, I promise you, ever...

1642
01:04:57,374 --> 01:04:59,709
You're sitting there
doing that like a circus monkey,

1643
01:04:59,709 --> 01:05:03,338
no girl is gonna
turn around, like...

1644
01:05:09,928 --> 01:05:12,847
"My, my, my."

1645
01:05:12,847 --> 01:05:14,515
"You know what's crazy?

1646
01:05:14,515 --> 01:05:17,310
"Um...

1647
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:22,357
"I didn't want to have sex
with you before.

1648
01:05:22,357 --> 01:05:25,110
"But now...

1649
01:05:25,110 --> 01:05:31,032
"Now that you've displayed
the agility..."

1650
01:05:31,032 --> 01:05:34,744
"Of your flaccid penis...

1651
01:05:34,744 --> 01:05:39,707
"As it slaps
in rhythmic repetition...

1652
01:05:39,707 --> 01:05:41,376
"Against either one

1653
01:05:41,376 --> 01:05:45,297
"of your clearly
never-seen-by-the-sun thighs,

1654
01:05:45,297 --> 01:05:48,967
now, snootch time."

1655
01:06:03,856 --> 01:06:06,818
In closing, I would...

1656
01:06:06,818 --> 01:06:09,028
In closing, I would like to give

1657
01:06:09,028 --> 01:06:11,823
the girls in this room
a bit of advice, okay?

1658
01:06:11,823 --> 01:06:14,326
I have a tip for you,
but just the tip.

1659
01:06:20,248 --> 01:06:25,170
Ladies, never order a lobster
on a date.

1660
01:06:25,170 --> 01:06:26,712
The lobster is the most

1661
01:06:26,712 --> 01:06:28,923
expensive thing
on the menu, okay?

1662
01:06:28,923 --> 01:06:32,511
So just know that if you order
and consume a lobster,

1663
01:06:32,511 --> 01:06:35,847
you have to touch
your date's weiner.

1664
01:06:35,847 --> 01:06:37,474
You have to, okay?

1665
01:06:37,474 --> 01:06:41,394
It's like a sexual contract
from the sea.

1666
01:06:44,730 --> 01:06:46,816
It's binding.

1667
01:06:46,816 --> 01:06:50,403
Now, keep in mind he wants you
to get the lobster.

1668
01:06:50,403 --> 01:06:52,322
He's not gonna make you get it,

1669
01:06:52,322 --> 01:06:54,615
but he's hoping you'll come
to that conclusion on your own.

1670
01:06:54,615 --> 01:06:56,368
He's hoping you'll be flipping
through the menu,

1671
01:06:56,368 --> 01:06:58,411
and you'll be, like,
"I don't know what to get.

1672
01:06:58,411 --> 01:06:59,829
"Like, I'm just... i don't know.
I'm eating fresh this week.

1673
01:06:59,829 --> 01:07:01,747
"I'm eating a lot
of fresh things.

1674
01:07:01,747 --> 01:07:03,958
"That's my new thing, fresh.
I'm just gonna do fresh food."

1675
01:07:03,958 --> 01:07:06,127
"Lobster?

1676
01:07:06,127 --> 01:07:08,046
"Should I... should I get it?
Should I get it?

1677
01:07:08,046 --> 01:07:09,672
"Should I get the lobster?

1678
01:07:09,672 --> 01:07:10,923
"Should I crack it open
on my head like an otter,

1679
01:07:10,923 --> 01:07:12,008
"eat it off my chest?

1680
01:07:12,008 --> 01:07:13,343
Lobster?"

1681
01:07:13,343 --> 01:07:15,094
"Yeah, 'cause then,
it's weiner time

1682
01:07:15,094 --> 01:07:16,846
this Sunday at vagina."

1683
01:07:20,517 --> 01:07:22,435
Here's how it's gonna
go down, okay?

1684
01:07:22,435 --> 01:07:23,769
You're gonna be
making out later.

1685
01:07:23,769 --> 01:07:25,564
And now, guys,
this is for you to know.

1686
01:07:25,564 --> 01:07:27,648
Just so you know, as girls,

1687
01:07:27,648 --> 01:07:29,817
we like to make out with you
when we first meet you.

1688
01:07:29,817 --> 01:07:31,528
We like to make out with you
a couple times

1689
01:07:31,528 --> 01:07:33,029
and then leave
right when you think

1690
01:07:33,029 --> 01:07:34,822
we're gonna sleep
with you, okay?

1691
01:07:34,822 --> 01:07:36,824
We do it to make sure
that you like us.

1692
01:07:36,824 --> 01:07:38,201
But if you want to know
the truth,

1693
01:07:38,201 --> 01:07:41,829
they teach us this shit
in high school.

1694
01:07:41,829 --> 01:07:43,831
While you were off building
a birdhouse in shop class,

1695
01:07:43,831 --> 01:07:45,666
we were off learning
how to be annoying.

1696
01:07:45,666 --> 01:07:47,586
Here's how it happens.

1697
01:07:47,586 --> 01:07:48,878
You're gonna be making out.

1698
01:07:48,878 --> 01:07:50,129
And you'll notice
that when a girl

1699
01:07:50,129 --> 01:07:51,381
makes out with you
and leaves you,

1700
01:07:51,381 --> 01:07:52,591
we always leave
in a very sweet way

1701
01:07:52,591 --> 01:07:53,966
because we want you to have

1702
01:07:53,966 --> 01:07:56,219
a nice impression of us
for later, right?

1703
01:07:56,219 --> 01:07:58,346
So it's always, like,
"okay, well, I gotta go.

1704
01:07:58,346 --> 01:08:00,890
Bye." No, you didn't. No.

1705
01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:03,560
"Bye. I love you too. Stop it."

1706
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,103
It's always very sweet, right?

1707
01:08:05,103 --> 01:08:06,896
I've gone as far
as to sometimes bring

1708
01:08:06,896 --> 01:08:08,481
a little thing
of vanilla body spray.

1709
01:08:08,481 --> 01:08:09,774
And when he gets up
to go to the bathroom,

1710
01:08:09,774 --> 01:08:11,067
I spray it on his pillow.

1711
01:08:11,067 --> 01:08:12,277
That way, later,
when he texts me,

1712
01:08:12,277 --> 01:08:13,486
he's like, "oh, my God.

1713
01:08:13,486 --> 01:08:15,113
My pillow still smells
like you."

1714
01:08:15,113 --> 01:08:17,782
I'm like, "that's amazing."

1715
01:08:17,782 --> 01:08:19,158
"I don't know why."

1716
01:08:19,158 --> 01:08:20,619
You can get creative with it.

1717
01:08:20,619 --> 01:08:22,245
You can take a handful
of glitter on your date.

1718
01:08:22,245 --> 01:08:23,746
And then after you're leaving,
just be, like,

1719
01:08:23,746 --> 01:08:25,998
"okay, I gotta go."

1720
01:08:25,998 --> 01:08:27,500
"Bye."

1721
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:30,253
You can bring a smoke bomb...

1722
01:08:30,253 --> 01:08:31,463
And then, like,
still be standing there

1723
01:08:31,463 --> 01:08:34,424
'cause you don't know magic.

1724
01:08:34,424 --> 01:08:35,758
Girls always leave
in a sweet way.

1725
01:08:35,758 --> 01:08:37,135
We never leave in a huff.

1726
01:08:37,135 --> 01:08:38,719
It's never, like,
"well, I got mine.

1727
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:40,346
Eat my shit later, fuck-tard."

1728
01:08:42,432 --> 01:08:44,016
Never doing that.

1729
01:08:44,016 --> 01:08:45,518
So we're gonna be
making out later.

1730
01:08:45,518 --> 01:08:46,978
And here's how it's gonna go.

1731
01:08:46,978 --> 01:08:48,229
We're gonna be making out, okay?

1732
01:08:48,229 --> 01:08:50,273
So this is making out, okay?

1733
01:08:50,273 --> 01:08:52,150
I'm 12, this is what making out
looks like.

1734
01:08:52,150 --> 01:08:53,568
And the guy's gonna be, like,

1735
01:08:53,568 --> 01:08:54,986
"oh, I like making out with you
so much."

1736
01:08:54,986 --> 01:08:56,446
"I like making out with you."

1737
01:08:56,446 --> 01:08:58,323
"Tonight was so fun."
"It was really fun."

1738
01:08:58,323 --> 01:08:59,616
"You're so hot." "I know."

1739
01:08:59,616 --> 01:09:01,075
"This is so fun.
I really like you.

1740
01:09:01,075 --> 01:09:02,452
You're so pretty."
"I know, this is great.

1741
01:09:02,452 --> 01:09:05,204
I am pretty."
"Oh, I like you a lot.

1742
01:09:05,204 --> 01:09:08,458
So you wanna keep going?"
Girls, that's your cue.

1743
01:09:08,458 --> 01:09:11,002
"All right, well, I gotta go."
"What?"

1744
01:09:11,002 --> 01:09:14,755
"I gotta go, bye."

1745
01:09:14,755 --> 01:09:16,882
"Later."

1746
01:09:16,882 --> 01:09:19,177
And the guy is gonna try

1747
01:09:19,177 --> 01:09:21,429
to get you to stay, right?
As he should.

1748
01:09:21,429 --> 01:09:23,723
You can't just walk
out of a spider's web.

1749
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:27,560
"You're really gonna go?
Come on. Come on.

1750
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:30,896
"Amber. You really gonna go?

1751
01:09:32,815 --> 01:09:35,901
You really gonna go?"

1752
01:09:37,903 --> 01:09:41,658
"Really gonna go?"

1753
01:09:49,123 --> 01:09:53,085
"Really just go?
You're just gonna go? Huh?"

1754
01:10:09,519 --> 01:10:11,103
"You're just gonna leave it
like this?"

1755
01:10:11,103 --> 01:10:13,272
"I'm sorry.

1756
01:10:13,272 --> 01:10:14,774
"Were we in the middle
of open heart surgery?

1757
01:10:14,774 --> 01:10:16,025
"I'm pretty sure you're fine.

1758
01:10:16,025 --> 01:10:17,610
"Yeah.

1759
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:20,321
"I'm not a doctor per se,
but I'm fairly confident

1760
01:10:20,321 --> 01:10:21,864
"that blood will return
to your system.

1761
01:10:21,864 --> 01:10:24,992
Walk it off, champ."

1762
01:10:26,745 --> 01:10:27,912
That might sound harsh,

1763
01:10:27,912 --> 01:10:29,539
but it took ten years
of me dating

1764
01:10:29,539 --> 01:10:31,874
to learn that a boner
isn't a medical condition.

1765
01:10:31,874 --> 01:10:34,168
So I'm paying you back
right now.

1766
01:10:37,963 --> 01:10:39,424
Now, he's pissed,

1767
01:10:39,424 --> 01:10:40,966
mostly because he has
a raging erection

1768
01:10:40,966 --> 01:10:42,635
and you called him "champ."

1769
01:10:42,635 --> 01:10:44,887
Now, he's mad.

1770
01:10:44,887 --> 01:10:46,806
"Really? You're gonna go?
That's messed up.

1771
01:10:46,806 --> 01:10:48,432
That's messed up!"

1772
01:10:48,433 --> 01:10:49,934
"It's messed up, Amber.
You're just gonna go.

1773
01:10:49,934 --> 01:10:51,561
"Let me... Just gonna go?

1774
01:10:51,561 --> 01:10:53,145
"It's funny. It's funny.

1775
01:10:53,145 --> 01:10:55,439
"You're just gonna go
'cause, uh... Huh.

1776
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:59,986
I distinctly remember
I bought you a lobster."

1777
01:11:04,198 --> 01:11:08,119
The man's right.
Time to pay the Piper.

1778
01:11:08,119 --> 01:11:09,995
Girls, you do not have
to sleep with him.

1779
01:11:09,995 --> 01:11:14,041
It's just a crustacean.
That's ridiculous, all right?

1780
01:11:14,041 --> 01:11:16,294
But you got
to give him something.

1781
01:11:16,294 --> 01:11:18,838
I-I suggest a beej.
That's what I suggest.

1782
01:11:20,172 --> 01:11:21,841
That's proper.
Don't do a hand job.

1783
01:11:21,841 --> 01:11:23,718
That's ridiculous.
That's child's play.

1784
01:11:26,178 --> 01:11:28,222
Hand job? A handy? Really?

1785
01:11:28,222 --> 01:11:30,266
As a grown woman, you're not
doing a hand job, okay?

1786
01:11:30,266 --> 01:11:32,101
If you voted,
you're not doing a hand job.

1787
01:11:34,103 --> 01:11:36,564
Let's send some hand jobs
overseas to China.

1788
01:11:39,734 --> 01:11:41,152
Not doing a hand job.

1789
01:11:41,152 --> 01:11:42,528
A hand job, who does...
That's what kids do

1790
01:11:42,528 --> 01:11:44,155
when you're, like, a teenager.

1791
01:11:44,155 --> 01:11:46,407
You do a hand job.
You put on your promise ring.

1792
01:11:46,407 --> 01:11:48,493
You revel in your virginity
for the next 10 to 15 years

1793
01:11:48,493 --> 01:11:50,244
depending on your involvement
with comic books.

1794
01:11:50,244 --> 01:11:51,621
That's what a hand job is for.

1795
01:11:51,621 --> 01:11:53,623
As an adult, it's not happening.

1796
01:11:53,623 --> 01:11:55,750
It's an intermediary step
in a sexual evolution

1797
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:57,960
that you've evolved past, okay?

1798
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:02,674
It's like a tail...

1799
01:12:02,674 --> 01:12:04,216
Necessary at one point
for balance,

1800
01:12:04,216 --> 01:12:05,718
but if you busted it out
at a house party,

1801
01:12:05,718 --> 01:12:08,012
people would be,
like, weirded out.

1802
01:12:12,391 --> 01:12:15,436
I was out with a guy one time
who I wasn't even into.

1803
01:12:15,436 --> 01:12:18,857
I didn't want to do anything.
And he didn't buy me a lobster.

1804
01:12:18,857 --> 01:12:19,899
And I was...
I explained everything.

1805
01:12:19,899 --> 01:12:21,400
And after talking to him,

1806
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:24,028
he's like,
"I'd like a hand job."

1807
01:12:25,530 --> 01:12:27,281
"I think it sounds great."

1808
01:12:27,281 --> 01:12:28,991
And I guess I was frustrated

1809
01:12:28,991 --> 01:12:31,369
'cause he hadn't been listening
to me or my feelings.

1810
01:12:31,369 --> 01:12:32,620
And I was like, "all right.

1811
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:35,080
"I'll tell you what, son.

1812
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:37,834
"I'm gonna give you a hand job.

1813
01:12:37,834 --> 01:12:39,544
But it's gonna be on my terms."

1814
01:12:41,253 --> 01:12:44,340
"45 minutes long..."

1815
01:12:48,594 --> 01:12:51,723
"No lotion..."

1816
01:12:54,099 --> 01:12:55,685
"And you don't break
eye contact.

1817
01:12:55,685 --> 01:12:56,185
Go!"

1818
01:13:15,914 --> 01:13:19,625
What kills me is that you get
that I'm kidding.

1819
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:22,837
He did not.

1820
01:13:22,837 --> 01:13:25,757
I swear to God he goes,
"aw, no lotion?"

1821
01:13:28,509 --> 01:13:29,802
"That doesn't sound fun."

1822
01:13:29,802 --> 01:13:31,930
Like the 45-minute part
is tolerable?

1823
01:13:34,348 --> 01:13:36,434
"Iliza, come on.
You gotta do something.

1824
01:13:36,434 --> 01:13:39,019
You gotta give me lotion
or do something cute."

1825
01:13:39,019 --> 01:13:41,940
It threw me off
that he said "cute"

1826
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:43,900
because that's not an adjective
I believe

1827
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:48,446
belongs anywhere near an h.J.

1828
01:13:48,446 --> 01:13:49,948
It sounded creepy in a way.

1829
01:13:49,948 --> 01:13:51,824
I was like,
"what do you mean 'cute'?

1830
01:13:51,824 --> 01:13:53,743
"What... what's cute?
What do you want?

1831
01:13:53,743 --> 01:13:55,787
What do you want, kitten paws?"

1832
01:14:12,261 --> 01:14:15,055
It's probably how that one cat
lost his eye.

1833
01:14:15,055 --> 01:14:16,181
You guys are fantastic.

1834
01:14:16,181 --> 01:14:17,475
Thank you so much
for coming out.

1835
