Doug, I can't understand it.The dampers won't stay opened.

32
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,030
節氣閘，怎麼不問你好？
-Whatever happened to "hello"?

33

-Thompson G-4s. -Don't you think they should be G-12s?

41
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,510
所以才造成了這該死的混亂局面
That's what comes from last-minute panic.

42
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,920
我去把它修好

56
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,830
對付你我只需要一樣東西在你箱子
All I need to go with you is in that suitcase.

別忘了告訴他們 這是我的主意
...remember to tell them that it was my idea.

媽媽說謝謝

80
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,590
等一下，我把你臉擦擦

什麼反應也沒有
I don't get any reading.

92
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,650
試一試備用電機
Try the auxiliary generator.

93
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,200
怎麼回事…
What the hell?

94
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,330

00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,120
這一層除了公寓還有辦公室嗎？
Are there offices on this floor, as well as apartments?

97

我不喜歡混在一起
I wouldn't like that at all!

105
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,020
什麼地方出了毛病
Something's screwed up.

106
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,580
感測器沒有觸發消防部的警報
The sensor didn't trip the fire alarm.

107
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,090
那是當然？
Why should it?

108
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,890
你會發現其中的原因   因為沒有著火
You can see for yourself.There's no fire.

109
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,990
不對，感測器顯示有失火

I want you up there with me. We can do good things together.

113
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,580
你怎麼啦？
What's the matter?

114
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,230
說吧？
Hello?

Dave's leaving. They've offered me managing editor.

116
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,900
那是好事啊
That's nice.

117
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,360
我是說…
I mean--

118
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,000
我們有點小小的麻煩
I guess we've got ourselves a situation.

119
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,240
好像是的
It seems.

120
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,740
道格，我想過你說的那種生活 我很喜歡
I want the kind of life you're talking about. I want that.

121
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:35,020
我想讓我們的孩子 住在可以自由奔跑的地方
I want a place where our kids can run around and grow and be free.

122
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,420
但是？
But?

123
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,530
我想要這份工作 我盼了五年
I want this job.I wanted it for five years.

124
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,500
為了它我奮鬥了五年

127
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,540
我們可以想個辦法 試著過一種新的生活
I can do something with it that hasn't been done before.

128
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:03,980
意思就是說，我都想要 但魚和雄掌不可兼得，對嗎？
I guess I want both, and I can't have both. Can l?

129
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,810
我不知道
I don't know.

130
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,520
是我
Yeah

131

00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,980
我們起動備用電機 它就短路了
We kicked on the auxiliary, and this shorted out.

136

-What about that? -It should've been conduit.

138
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,320
給我保護手套
Give me a pair of dikes.

139
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,550
我知道，我知道，卡拉罕來過電話
I know, I know. Callahan called me.

140
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,380
情況有多糟糕？
Now just how bad is it?

141
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,890
這要看你的想像力有多麼好
Depends on how good your imagination is.

142
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,230
該死的！施工手冊上說 要做絕緣保護的
Jesus Christ!Specs called for conduit safety covering.

143
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,760
你檢查了幾個保險終端櫃？
How many fuse terminals did you check?

144
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,890
我需要檢查幾個？
How many do I have to?

145
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,430
- 什麼事 - 比其洛先生來了
Mr. Bigelow is here, sir.

146
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,340
好的，請他進來
Okay, send him in.

147
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,680
僅憑一台燒毀的斷路器 上的一斷燒焦的斷路線…
Now, Doug, one piece of scorched wire...

148
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,240
你是很難下決定的
...from a burned-out circuit breaker isn't conclusive.

149
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,340
對，也許不能 但我現在擔心還會發生 多少出乎意料的事情
Maybe not. But now I'm worried about what other shocks we're in for.

150
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:54,250
威爾…道格…J.D…
Will, Doug...J.D.,

151
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,160
你來看看這個
wait till you see this.

152
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:04,930
怎麼啦？有人把一張牆紙貼倒了嗎？
What happened? Was the wallpaper hung wrong?

153
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,270
我們的設備出了毛病
We have an equipment problem.

154
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,940
- 大樓是不會有問題的，對嗎？ - 可能會
-No problem in the tower, is there? -Could be.

155
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,950
我說道格，你只是猜測
Come on. You're just guessing.

156
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:19,610
好的，我只是猜測 我要跟你的女婿談談 我馬上就要跟他談
I want to talk to your son-in-law.I wanna talk to him right away.

157
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,710
好吧
Okey

158
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,980
- 給我接羅傑.西門斯 - 好的，先生
-Get Roger Simmons. -Yes, sir.

159
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,050
我們會把這件事查清的 我向你保證
I guarantee I'll check this out.

160
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,960
我們當然會查清的
We're all going to check it out.

161
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,820
這堥鴝野X了什麼事
I'm missing something.

162
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,000
我們這堮t點起火了
We damn near had a fire.

163
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,570
沒錯，著火
Yeah, a fire.

164
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,600
在這棟樓堙H 得了吧
In this building? Come on.

165
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,680
你知道不知道 我們的安全設備還沒有完全安裝
We haven't finished installing the safety equipment.

166
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,410
這個晚會應該至少推遲一個月
-The party should've been put off--

167
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,180
好了，威爾
-Hold it, Will!

168
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,190
好了，你們過於緊張了
Everybody's overreacting.

169
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,880
- 什麼事？ - 西門斯先生出去了
-Mr. Simmons is out, sir.

170
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,120
他去哪了？
-Out where?

171
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:01,090
沒有知道，先生 我留言讓他回電話
They don 't know, sir, but I left word for him to call.

172
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,560
好吧
OK

173
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:09,330
我們明天找羅傑談談 然後再決定怎麼辦
We'll talk to Roger tomorrow. And then we'll decide what to do.

174
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,770
- 這樣總行了吧？ - 恐怕等不了
-That's okay, isn't it? -Nope. Won't wait.

175
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,740
再試試一號區
Try zone one again.

176
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,960
該死，這是當務之急 我們必須馬上修復電力系統
Damn it! This is top priority.We gotta get these electrical systems on.

177
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,860
沒有它 我們的整個安全系統就崩潰了
Our security program's loused up without them.

178
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,420
別走，等著我
Don't go away.

179
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,930
道格，真沒想到會是你
Doug! Well, what a surprise!

180
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,610
你的那位電器天才在哪？
Where's that electrical genius of yours?

181
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:30,170
我們打電話到他的辦公室 到處都找不到他
I called his office, the club, the marina. No luck.

182
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,720
他幹了什麼？
What's he done?

183
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,550
過來，我給你倒杯喝的
Come on, I'll get you a drink.

184
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,050
他一定幹了壞事 因為我爸爸打來電話了
He must've done something. My father called.

185
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,390
他好多年都沒生過這麼大的氣了
He hasn't been that upset in years.

186
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,190
知道他現在在哪？
Have any idea where he is?

187
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,600
我丈夫的領地範圍非常大
Well my husband's territory ranges rather widely.

188
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,970
幾乎和大灰狼一樣
It's like that of the timber wolf,

189
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,070
可能在方圓五十堨炙k的地方
anywhere within a 50-mile radius.

190
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,410
不過，你要是願意等的話 他一會出現的
But if you wanna wait, he'll show up.

191
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,500
一定的 他的衣服還在這呢
He has to. His clothes are here.

192
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,450
- 給你倒杯酒，好嗎？ - 不，謝謝
-Can I get you a drink? -No, thanks.

193
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,150
看樣子你不想告訴我羅傑幹了些什麼
I guess you don't plan to tell me what Roger's done.

194
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,000
嗨，道格
Hi, Doug.

195
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,730
- 親愛的 - 嗨
-Honey. -Hello.

196
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,570
最近你喝什麼酒？
-What are you drinking these days?

197
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,330
我現在什麼也不喝
-Nothing, right now.

198
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:30,000
歡迎從荒野歸來
Well, welcome back from the wilderness.

199
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,570
大駕當臨有何貴幹？
To what do we owe the pleasure?

200
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,050
卡拉罕測試一台備用電機
Callahan was testing a backup generator.

201
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,640
忽然電流激增造成系統癱瘓
There was a systems failure.

202
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,350
- 怎麼會呢？ - 從理論上說不可能…
How can that be? It can't be, theoretically.

203
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,990
除非你篡改了電路工程標準
Unless you screwed around with the electrical specifications.

204
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,350
你倒是真不客氣？
That's being rather blunt, isn't it?

205
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,090
說得沒錯
You betcha.

206
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,530
那麼別怪我也不客氣了
Then you'll understand my being equally blunt.

207
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,500
這與你有什麼狗屁關係？
What the hell business is it of yours?

208
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:01,600
我只想知道你這麼做拿了多少回扣
I wonder what kickbacks were involved.

209
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,430
我用不著在這媗尼琲獐o話
I don't have to take crap from you.

210
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,570
聽著，主倉庫現在起火
Listen. We had an electrical flare-up in the main utility room.

211
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,090
我認為所用的電線不符合我的要求
Some of that wiring wasn't exactly what I asked for.

212
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,960
我安裝在樓堛漕C根電線都很標準： 並且都經過檢查和批准
All the wire I put in is up to code, inspected and approved.

213
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:22,960
那棟樓不能用普通標準 這你很清楚
Code's not enough for that building! And you know it!

214
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,060
所以我一再強調 所有材料都必須大大高於標準
I asked for installations way above standard.

215
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:30,070
夥計，你生活在夢境 而我生活在現實中
Buddy, you live in a dream world. I deal in realities.

216
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,840
我要你的電路圖表和 所有派工單影本
I want your wiring diagrams and copies of your work orders.

217
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:39,710
都找齊需要幾個星期 你還不夠資格讓我這麼做
That would take weeks and a lot more clout than you have!

218
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,970
送到我辦公室，明早9：00
In my office! Tomorrow, 9:00.

219
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,820
人們說他曾在蒙大納和黑熊摔過跤
They say he used to wrestle grizzly bears in Montana.

220
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,990
當然是他年輕時 可能身體比現在壯
Of course, he was younger then. Probably in better condition.

221
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:59,190
這件事一定讓你樂不可滋
You must have enjoyed all this immensely.

222
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,200
不，我沒有
No, I didn't.

223
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,070
我真是為我們倆個人感到悲哀
Actually, I'm depressed for both of us.

224
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,200
你希望我怎麼做 當頭給他一拳？
What did you expect me to do? Punch him in the nose?

225
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,310
你要是在爸爸的大樓堸竣F手腳 叫上帝去救你吧
If you've done anything to Dad's building, God help you.

226
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,650
親愛的，我不需要乞求上帝 或是你的父親
Baby, I don't need God's help or your old man's. Not anymore.

227
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,650
不再需要了 所以別再指望老頭子一吼…
So don't expect me to shake every time Daddy barks...

228
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,950
我就會全身發抖 如果這是你希望的話
...even if that's what you want me to do.

229
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:29,360
我想要的 只是我當初想要嫁的那個人
All I want is the man I thought I married.

230
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:36,930
我們繼續維持婚姻的理由 已經沒有了，是不是？
I guess we're running out of reasons to stay married, aren't we?

231
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:43,910
天快黑了，出席晚會不能遲到
It's getting late.Mustn't miss the party.

232
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,690
阿納海姆電力

233
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,810
請後退
Stand back, please!

234
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,240
不要越過警界線
Everybody, back of the ropes!

235
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:31,340
後退，請退到繩子後面
Stand back, please. Everybody, back of the ropes!

236
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,490
你好
Hi.

237
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:50,370
現在整7：30 希望你喜歡守時的男人
7:30 sharp. I hope you like your men prompt.

238
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,530
在我這個年齡？我只希望他們不會逃跑
At my age?I only care that they show up at all.

239
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,400
沒那回事
Nonsense.

240
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,440
乖乖別淘氣
Be a good girl, Elke.

241
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:04,070
廚房媯鳩A留了牛奶 咱們回頭見
I left you some milk in the kitchen. See you later.

242
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:11,550
- 找到西門斯了？ - 對，找到了
Did you find Simmons?Yeah, I found him.

243
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,990
他到底改沒改過你的設計？
Did he or didn't he change your specs?

244
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,260
他沒有承認，但我敢打賭他幹了
He didn't admit it, but I bet you he did.

245
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:20,300
他肯定是為了回扣才這麼幹的
Payoffs and kickbacks. The only way he could've swung it.

246
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,470
你看
Here you are...

247
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:27,600
這是你的原設計圖
...your original specs.

248
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:30,340
只有一號區，我們總得從某處入手
Zone one only, but we gotta start somewhere.

249
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,780
這個混蛋給我們出了一個天大的難題
That son of a bitch gave us an impossible job.

250
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,790
- 蘇珊 - 你好，丹，真熱鬧
-Susan. -Hello, Dan.Good evening.

251
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,380
- 你好嗎，親愛的？ - 吉姆，祝賀你
-How are you, dear? -Congratulations.

252
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,490
- 這太壯觀了 - 謝謝
It's magnificent. Thank you.

253
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,760
你先到前面去
I'll meet you out front.

254
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,130
我和蘇姍說幾句話
-I'd like to talk to Susan.

255
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,290
好的
-Right.

256
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,960
能夠找到一個建築師，他設計了你
Find me the architect who designed you...

257
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,600
並且需要道格.羅伯茨？
...and who needs Doug Roberts?

258
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,800
我能
I do.

259
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,780
女士們先生們，在這個歡慶的夜晚
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a gala evening.

260
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:13,440
全城沉浸在節日喜慶氣氛中
The entire city is in a holiday mood.

261
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,820
名人顯貴才子佳麗將齊聚一堂
The list of luminaries reads like a Who's Who.

262
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:19,480
其中有政府要員社交名流
There are leaders from society and government...

263
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,760
電影電視明星
...stars of screen and television.

264
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:26,490
現在到達的是 尊敬的派克.加里參議員
And now, just arriving, the Honorable Gary Parker...

265
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:29,800
聯邦政府城市改造委員會主席
...chairman of the Federal Urban Renewal Commission.

266
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:34,000

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,500
沒想到把我看得這麼緊
I wasn't aware the leash was that tight.

286

I've never seen the bridge look like that.

302
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,380
- 這真是太漂亮了！ - 簡直令人難以置信！
-It's unbelievable! -Astonishing!

303
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,090

要不要留一條夜急專線？
Shall I leave you a night line?

306
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,400
不用了，白天電話已經接過了 全部切斷吧
No, you can disconnect. I've had it with phones for today.

307
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,240
- 晚安 - 晚安

我有封信需要馬上發送
Sorry, but I have a letter that must go out.

310
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,150
星期一見，珍妮特

- 晚安，先生 - 晚安
Good night. Good night.

312
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,550
真沒想到晚會以前他就會回來
Gee, I never thought he'd come back here before the party.

313
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,990
我們要是早走十分鐘就好了
We almost missed him.

314
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,650
沒關係 反正今晚我也沒事
It's all right. I'm not gonna do anything tonight.

315
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,690
- 祝你玩得愉快 - 謝謝，你也是
Have a nice weekend.Thanks. You too.

316
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,290
你好
Hello.

317
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,060
嘿
Hi.

318
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,690
- 答應我一件事？ - 什麼事？
-Promise me something? -What?

319
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:33,260
我開始不珍惜你的話 你要開始採取行動
If I ever start taking you for granted, do something about it.

320
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:35,340
你有什麼建議？
And what do you suggest?

321
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,070
拔斷電話線
Cut off the phone lines.

322
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:41,050
把咖啡潑到我臉上
Pour coffee down my neck.

323
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,240
擰我的鼻子？
Tweak my nose?

324
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,580
我保證
I promise.

325
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,820
- 嗨 - 瑪姬，家堣H都還好吧？
-How's the family?

326
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:01,260

327
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,490
是的

328
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,290
- 我們可否說句話？ - 好的，待會見
-Would you excuse us, gentlemen? -Certainly.

329
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,920
今天我想給你點驚喜
-I've got a surprise for you.

330
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,990
政治家不喜歡驚喜
-Politicians don't like surprises.

331
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,870
- 卡洛斯 - 您喝點什麼，先生
-Carlos? -Yes, sir.

332
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,930
我能為你做些什麼，鄧肯先生？
-What can I fix you?

333
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,970
這位是派克參議員
-Meet Senator Parker.

334
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,240
- 卡洛斯，你好 - 我太榮幸了，派克參議員
-Great pleasure. -It's an honor, senator.

335
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:21,140
把你藏在下面的東西拿給參議員吧
Show him what you've been hiding back there.

336
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,700
好的，先生
Yes, sir.

337
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,340
29年的藏酒！
1929?

338
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,510
今晚你只喝這種酒
-That's all you'll drink tonight.

339
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,850
一整箱嗎？
-A whole case?

340
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,760
喝剩下的，我們給你運回華盛頓去
What you don't drink, we'll ship to Washington.

341
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,960
- 請打開一瓶，好吧 - 好的，先生
-Open a bottle, will you? -Yes, sir.

342
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:43,660
你是從哪兒搞到這種酒的？
How did you ever come by a whole case?

343
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,830
告訴我，吉姆
Come on, Jim.

344
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,160
這算不了什麼
It's nothing.

345
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,650
我猜： 你在找一個人？
I guess you're looking for someone.

346
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,940
你看見他了？
I am. Have you seen him?

347
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,650
我為帕提和我要了杯酒 你想要點什麼？
I've ordered for Patty. What can I get you?

348
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,280
現在不喝，謝謝，羅傑
-Nothing right now. Thank you, Roger.

349
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,290
蘇珊，告訴我，當丈夫決定要離開兩年…
-Susan, tell me,What does a girl do in San Francisco

350
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,490
那姑娘在三藩市幹些什麼？
when her old man decides to leave for two years?

351
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,460
我不知道
Beats me, buddy.

352
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,530
不想找個男朋友？
No headhunting?

353
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,200
幹這種事會有點困難
I've had a little trouble making that work.

354
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,970
要不咱們談談，明天的午餐？
Could we discuss that tomorrow at lunch?

355
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,340
不
No.

356
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,550
你想念你的別墅嗎
-You must miss your villa.

357
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,280
也想也不想
-Well, yes and no.

358
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,190
法國南方令人氣味索然
It gets rather dull in the south of France.

359
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,130
我說的是真的，除了游泳，開快艇
Nothing but swimming and yachting

360
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,030
就是沒完沒了的晚會
partying and all that sort of thing.

361
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:51,370
說來你也許不信 她們為了幾個不多的單身漢爭風吃醋
And believe it or not, they fight over the few eligible bachelors.

362
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:53,960
包括我這樣的老廢物
Even such old scraps as l.

363
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,740
- 你不要這樣謙卑吧 - 請坐？
-No false humility, please. -Oh, shall we?

364
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,430
我…
I. .

365
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:04,000
我決定回到三藩市的現實生活中來…
I decided to come back to the reality of San Francisco.

366
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,520
恢復我的判斷力和謙虛謹慎…
...to regain my perspective and my humility...

367
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:10,990
而且多花點時間在我唯一擅長的事情上
...and spend more time at the one thing I'm really good at:

368
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,020
股票市場
The stock market.

369
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:17,190
你是說蒙特卡洛的損失 三藩市的收穫
Monte Carlo's losses, San Francisco's gains.

370
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,860
謝謝
Thank you.

371
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,130
你… 你相信不相信命運?？
Do you believe in destiny?

372
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,200
所有的好事，我都相信
I believe in all good things.

373
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:33,510
我回家的一個重要的原因
There must be a reason for my coming back home.

374
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,380
和你相會
Meeting you.

375
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,430
肯定有問題
This can't be right.

376
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:08,140
電線燙手，最好馬上關掉
It's too hot.You better leave it off.

377
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,390
控制室，韋斯
Utility. Wes.

378
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,690

Doug, I'm up on 83 with Will.We got a wiring problem.

379
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,750
這堛犒q線有問題 如果超載會有大麻煩的
Overloads could be trouble.

380
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:28,960
你盡可能多的關閉一號區系統的電力
Shut down as many of the zone one systems as you can.

381
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:33,160
我不能這麼做.為了落成儀式 我們打開了所有的燈
I can't do that.All the lights are on for the dedication ceremony.

382
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:36,770
所有的 你是說，整個大樓？
You mean the whole building?

383
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,570
我們這堣@切正常
We're taking the overload just fine.

384
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:42,670
打燈關掉，馬上關掉
Well, shut it down right away.

385
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:46,210
沒有鄧肯先生的直接批准 我不能這麼做
I can't do that without an okay from Mr. Duncan himself.

386
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,690
一切責任由我來負 你馬上關掉那該死的燈
I'll accept the responsibility. Just turn off the lights!

387
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,450
那舞會怎麼辦？
What about the lights in the tower for the party?

388
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,220
我沒有說關掉所有的燈 只說關掉超載的燈
-Not all the power, just the overload!

389
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:56,260
好的，先生
-Yes, sir, Mr. Roberts!

390
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,800
我們馬上到81樓檢查繼電器
We better get down to 81 and check the relay systems.

391
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,930
他們把全樓的燈都打開了
They turned on everything in the whole building.

392
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,730
81樓有問題
There's something on 81.

393
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:24,080
比爾給消防隊打電話 以防自動報警線失靈
Phone it in, in case the lines to the fire department are out.

394
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,450
- 我去81樓 - 好的
-I'll be in 81. -You got it.

395
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,830
把窗簾扯下來！
Get those drapes!

396
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,310
把火壓滅！ 快把火壓滅！

400
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,890
上帝
God

401
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,840
往下，往下一點
Down, down! Stay low!

402
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,120
快點去叫輛救護車
Call an ambulance for this man.

403
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:44,720
快點！ 叫輛救護車！
Get on the ball! Call an ambulance!

404
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,690
叫這個樓層的人馬上撤離
I want everybody off this floor!

405
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:50,200
- 消防隊呢？ - 他們馬上就到
-The fire department? -On their way.

406
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:53,400
叫救護車！ 幫我一下，把他送上電梯
Get that ambulance. Give me a hand. Get him in the elevator.

407
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:57,870
儘量不要用手碰他 抓住他的皮帶
All right, try not to touch him. Try to get him by his belt.

408
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,880
我在81樓 這堨X事故了
This is 81.

409
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:02,180
一個人被燒傷了，叫輛救護車
A man's been burned. Get an ambulance.

410
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,770
- 是的，馬上 - 給頂層的鄧肯打電話
Yes, right away.Call Duncan in the tower.

411
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,790
上面有很多的人
He's got a lot of people up there.

412
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,550
- 什麼？ - 快打電話！
-What? -Do it now!

413
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:28,030
是羅伯茨先生
It's Mr. Roberts.

414
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,010
是我，道格，我們開始擔心你啦
Yeah, Doug. We were getting worried about you.

415
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,340
蘇姍在這，派克參議員 市長還有市長夫人
Susan's here, Senator Parker, the mayor and his wife.

416
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:37,940
他們都想知道世界上最好的建築師在哪
They're asking why the greatest architect isn't here.

417
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:41,350
別管這個了.威爾.吉丁斯被燒傷了 傷勢很嚴重
Never mind that. Will Giddings has been badly burned.

418
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:44,320
威爾燒傷了？怎麼搞的？
Will Giddings burned? How?

419
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,290
我已經叫了救護車
An ambulance is coming,

420
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:50,290
現在最好考慮一下 把上面那些人帶到一層去
but you better think about getting those people down on the ground floor.

421
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,890
為什麼？ 這堶接菑鶪F！
What for? We got a fire here!

422
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:57,130
我想已經控制住了，可是
Well, I think it's under control, but--

423
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,800
那麼，你還瞎緊張什麼？
Well, then why the urgency?

424
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,770
瞎緊張？
Urgency?

425
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,000
鄧肯，我告訴你，如果這是由電線引起的
If fluky wiring in this building caused that fire...

426
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,480
那麼任何地方都可能起火
...fires could break out everywhere!

427
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:10,980
道格，我看你是有點小題大作了
Doug, I think you're overreacting.

428
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:12,850
威爾.吉丁斯受傷，我很難過
I feel sorry for Will Giddings,

429
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,220
我們會照顧他的
but he'll be taken care of.

430
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:17,780
81樓主倉庫著火
But I won't concern myself

431
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,980
我不擔心
with a fire in a storage room on 81 ...

432
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,690
因為它不可能影響到我這
...because it can't possibly affect us up here...

433
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,190
在這棟大樓堙A這是不可能的
...not in this building.

434
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,690
等消防隊到來這後 你馬上派人來通知我
Now, have someone call me when the fire department arrives.

435
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,900
現在你馬上換上禮服 上來參加晚會
Meanwhile, get in your dinner jacket and come up and join the party!

436
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,370
現在，快點！
Now come on!

437
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:10,610
你知道蒙哥馬利街角的是哪棟樓…
What building's on the corner of Montgomery and--

438
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,510
天?
Oh, Jesus!

439
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:18,210
- 是摩天大樓 - 什麼？
-The glass tower! -What?

440
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,080
摩天大樓！
The glass tower!

441
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:24,680
但願著火的是一樓
I sure hope that fire's on the first floor.

442
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:30,090
你參加過高樓滅火嗎？
Did you ever fight one in a high rise?

443
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,250
是的
Yeah

444
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,620
有那麼困難嗎？
Is it as rough as I hear?

445
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:41,260
就像在煙囪媟壑
Like being inside a chimney.

446
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,060
我的天?！
Jesus!

447
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:06,690
這些人比我們先到
How in the hell did they get here before we did?

448
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,160
現在沒人待在家堣F吧？
Don't anybody ever stay home anymore?

449
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:32,060
- 來幾個幫幫忙到那邊去 - 是

450
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,680
你知道我讓你到那邊去？

451
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,060
邁克，著火了，煙很大
-Mike, she's throwing a lot of smoke.

452
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:38,760
- 81樓，是嗎？ - 是的
-Eighty-first floor, right?

453
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:41,130
我們控制了大堂 發出了第二次警報
We've got lobby control, second alarm is in.

454
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,690
- 組織臨時指揮部 - 知道了
-Set up a Forward Command. -Got it.

455
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,240
- 隊長，這是羅伯茨建築師
Chief this is Roberts, the architect.

456
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:51,610
情況怎麼樣，卡菲？
-What do we got here, Kappy?

457
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,770
據我們瞭解 火是從81樓燒起來的 主倉庫情況很糟
-Fire started, 81 st floor, storage room.

458
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:58,650
產生大量濃煙 我們看不清楚火勢蔓延多遠
It's bad. Smoke's so thick, we can't tell how far it's spread.

459
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,150
你們的通風系統呢？
-Exhaust system?

460
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:03,090
它們應該反向自動排煙 一定是電機被燒毀了
Should've reversed automatically. It must be a motor burnout.

461
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,090
- 噴連系統呢？ - 在81層沒人啟動
-Sprinklers? -They're not working on 81.

462
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,930
- 為什麼？ - 我不知道
-Why not? -I don't know.

463
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,530
- 吉姆？ - 我在這
-Jim? -Yes, sir?

464
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,530
簡要描敘一下你們的水塔系統
Give us a quick refresher on your standpipe system.

465
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,660
每層都有出水口  3英寸和1.5英寸兩種水管
-Floors have 3 and 1.5-inch outlets.

466
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:19,790
水流量？
-GPM?

467
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:23,670
1到68層每分鐘1500加侖 68到100層是1000加侖
Fifteen hundred from ground to 68, 1,000 from 68 to 100...

468
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,680
再往上是500加侖
...and 500 from there to the roof.

469
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,680
你肯定這些電梯是按緊急狀態設置的？
Are these elevators programmed for emergencies?

470
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,980
- 這兩層是 - 你的設計圖放在幾樓？
-What floor are your plans on?

471
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,410
79樓，我的辦公室
-79. My office.

472
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,250
很好，離火災低兩層 把臨時指揮部設在那
That's two floors below the fire. It'll be our Forward Command.

473
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,190
好了，夥計們，拿上設備 我們上去
Men, take up the equipment.Let's go.

474
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,860
好的
Okey

475
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,260
- 你們這些建築師啊 - 對，都是我們的錯
Architects!Yeah, it's all our fault.

476
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,940
你們明明知道對七層樓以上 的火災我們沒有把握
You know we can't fight a fire in anything over the 7th floor.

477
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:59,640
可你們還是能蓋多高就蓋多高
But you keep building them as high as you can.

478
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:03,080
你是來滅火的，還是來滅我的？
Are you here to take me on, or the fire?

479
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:08,380
好的，81樓情況怎麼樣？ 所有的人都撤退了嗎？
What about the 81st floor? You got everybody out of there?

480
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:13,310
我要看所有設計圖 81到85樓
I wanna see all floor plans, 81 through 85.

481
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:14,880
沒問題
Gotcha.

482
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:18,190
這些衡梁和玻璃正是我擔心的
This is what worries me. Those beams and that glass.

483
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:22,200
隊長，81樓的房客已經撤走了 但那的情況不妙
Chief, 81 has been evacuated, but it doesn't look too good up there.

484
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:24,390
給我一份承租人名單要多長時間
Give me a list of your tenants.

485
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:26,730
不要擔心他們 我們正要幫他們撤離
Don't worry. We're moving them out now.

486
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,500
不是住戶，是商業房客
Not live-ins. Businesses.

487
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:31,470
這方面我們很幸運 大部份都沒有搬來
We lucked up. Most of them haven't moved in yet.

488
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,480
已經搬進來的今天也不辦公
Those that have are off at night.

489
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:36,140
我想知道他們是誰，我不管他們在哪
I wanna know who they are, not where.

490
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:39,310
就是知道了他們是誰 又能怎麼樣呢？
What's that got to do with anything? Who they are?

491
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:41,980
他們當中有沒有羊毛或是絲綢製造商？
Any wool or silk manufacturers?

492
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:44,890
要知道著火會使羊毛和線綢散發氰化物
In a fire, wool and silk give off cyanide gas.

493
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,080
你們當中有沒有體育用品製造商？
Any sporting-good manufacturers, like table-tennis balls?

494
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,820
例如乒乓球會散發毒氣
They give off toxic gases.

495
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:54,090
- 還需要我繼續解釋？ - 我馬上把租房人的名單給你
Now do you want me to keep going? -One tenant list, coming up.

496
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:55,430
謝謝
-Thank you.

497
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,290
有幾個出口？
What do we got?

498
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:02,310
一層電梯，中央控制. 這兒有服務電梯
Elevator bank, central core.Service elevators here.

499
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:04,640
空調輸送管 6英寸
Air conditioning ducts, 6 inches.

500
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:08,150
- 管道都在這堙H - 1，2，3，4，5
-Pipe alleys here? -One, two, three, four, five.

501
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,540
- 這面是南？ - 對
-This is south? -South.

502
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:12,110
- 81樓有沒有地方正在施工？ - 沒有
Have you got any construction on 81?

503
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:13,340
有沒有易爆物…
Anything that can blow up,

504
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:15,820
比如說汽油，煤油，電池清潔劑？
like gasoline, fabric cleaner?

505
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:19,120
- 我想沒有 - 很好，我這就去81樓
I don't think so.Good. I'll be up on 81.

506
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:20,680
不管怎麼樣，建築師
For what it's worth,

507
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:23,320
我一直認為這棟樓不會著火
this is one building I figured wouldn't burn.

508
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:25,790
我也沒想到
Neither did l.

509
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:30,060
他們在開慶祝晚會
And they're celebrating. A party.

510
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:32,260
晚會？什麼晚會？ 在哪？
What party? Where?

511
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:34,960
在頂樓舞廳 300人
In the Promenade Room. 300 people.

512
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:36,730
你幹嘛不讓他們離開那鬼地方？
Why didn't you get them out?

513
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,740
你為什麼不親自對鄧肯先生說？ 他不肯聽我的
Why don't you go talk to Duncan? He ain't listening to me.

514
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:42,610
我會的
I will.

515
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,180
他來啦
Here he is now.

516
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,090
我是鄧肯
This is Duncan.

517
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,650
消防大隊長？
A battalion chief?

518
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:56,920
我等著他，謝謝
I'll watch out for him. Thank you.

519
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:04,730
特德，把你的人 帶下去檢查那邊的走廊
Ted, take your men down to check that hallway.

520
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,170
傑克
Jack?

521
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,730
傑克，怎麼樣？
Jack, how bad?

522
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:12,140
我感覺不好 火都燒到天花板了
I don't like the looks of it. It's running the ceiling.

523
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,880
轉著噴，包括屋頂
Work it around. Up there.

524
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,150
- 我到頂樓去 - 好的
-I'll be up topside. -Right.

525
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,520
傑克，你們要當心
Jack watch yourself.

526
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,790
再高一點
Keep it high.

527
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:16,300
- 你是找嗎，先生？ - 如果你是頓肯
-Looking for me, chief? -If you're Duncan.

528
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:19,330
我是，火情已經控制住了吧
I am.Everything under control?

529
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:21,570
你必須讓所有的人離開這
Gotta move these people out of here.

530
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:23,610
告訴我情況有多糟
Now, just how bad is it?

531
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,450
這是火災先生，情況很糟
It's a fire, mister, and all fires are bad.

532
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,150
我想你還是不太熟悉…
You're not familiar with the many modern safety systems...

533
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:32,990
專為這大廈設計的現代安全系統
we have designed into this building.

534
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:34,490
都是全套的
We've got them all.

535
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:37,660
大樓是你的 可滅火是我的事
It's your building, but it's our fire.

536
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:40,990
- 快讓他們離開 - 我看你沒有聽懂我的話
Now get out. I don't think you're listening.

537
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:45,200
81樓著火根本不可能燒到這
A fire on 81 can't reach up here, not in this building.

538
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:47,360
那好，我來說
-I'll do it.

539
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,930
等等，你別亂來，市長在那 你是不是想讓他來制止你
-Hold it, hold it.Do you want me to pull rank with the mayor?

540
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:54,440
在火災現場我的級別高於任何人
With a fire, I outrank everybody here.

541
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:56,670
我們不想引起恐慌
One thing we don't want is a panic.

542
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:59,080
我可以告訴他們 應該由你
I could tell them, but you ought to.

543
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:01,680
向你的賓客們解釋…
Just make a nice, cool announcement to all your guests...

544
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:04,880
告訴他們晚會 該在火艙以下繼續進行
...that the party's being moved down below the fire floor. Now.

545
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:06,550
快去
Right row

546
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:49,760
帕提 你和蘇姍待在這
Patty, you and Susan stay right here where I can find you.

547
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:52,000
千萬別離開這張桌子
Now, don't leave this table.

548
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:54,060
我要跟你談談
You, I wanna talk to.

549
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,570
你是不是改變了道格的電路設計圖
Did you change any of Doug's electrical specifications?

550
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:04,640
- 我肯定是的 - 你為什麼要改
-I most certainly did. -For God's sake, why?

551
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,480
原因是顯而易見的，尤其是為你
The reason should be obvious, especially to you.

552
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:10,720
樓堸_火了 如果這跟你有半點聯繫
We've got a fire.If it was caused by what you did,

553
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:14,020
我就把你活活吊死 吊死兩次
I'll hang you out to dry. And then I'm going to hang you!

554
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,820
停一下，請你們也停一下
Would you please stop playing?Stop playing, will you?

555
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,230
女士們先生們…
Ladies and gentlemen... .

556
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,840
女士們先生們，請大家聽我說
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?

557
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:36,580
樓埵雀‘D倉庫起了火…
It seems that we have a small fire...

558
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:41,180
火勢很小，在五十層以下
...in one of our storage rooms 50 floors below.

559
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:44,380
我向大家保證沒有危險
I assure you there's no danger.

560
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:48,590
但根據消防部門的要求
But in accordance with the fire department's orders...

561
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,360
完全是預防程式
...a purely precautionary procedure...

562
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:57,090
我們將晚會轉移到樓下的大堂
...we're going to move the party down to the lobby for a while.

563
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:59,300
大廳堭N有…
And we'll be serving

564
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:01,270
雞尾酒和香檳供應
cocktails and champagne in our Continental Room.

565
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:05,240
我向大家保證 我們的晚宴是絕對不會推遲的
But I promise you, dinner will not be delayed.

566
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:07,940
現在請大家到電梯前去
Now if we can all move to the elevators... .

567
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:30,520
女士們先生們，請你們不必驚慌
Now, ladies and gentlemen there's no reason to rush.

568
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:34,970
派克參議員，你們請這邊
Senator Parker, you and your party.

569
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:38,570
真的不會有事
It's really all right.

570
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,470
在這等我，我馬上回來
Stay here. I'll be right back.

571
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:47,240
易斯萊提
-Lisolette! -Frank!

572
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:51,080
易斯萊提
Lisolette!

573
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,770
- 怎麼樣，隊長？ - 作最壞的打算
-How's it going, chief? -Better get ready.

574
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:15,200
打開82樓設計圖
Kappy, get the floor plans on 82. We got problems.

575
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,710
- 我們有麻煩了 - 火燒上去了
Fire lapping?

576
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:20,440
- 是的，我測試過了 - 每層樓都有電話插座
-Are your com lines tested? -Phone jacks on every floor.

577
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,650
每層樓插入一個有線廣播系統
-I'm plugging into your PA system. -No sweat.

578
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:25,850
- 有什麼緊急設備嗎？ - 電池備用系統
-Emergency setup? -Battery-powered standby system.

579
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:29,450
能不能把這些線接入你的雙向通訊車
Splice these lines into our two-way communications van.

580
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,050
- 當然能 - 沒問題嗎？
Sure. -No problem?

581
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,990
- 沒問題 - 這需要多長時間
-No problem. -How long will this take?

582
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,330
- 一分鐘 - 好極了
-A minute. Not bad.

583
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,830
我們的麻煩是
Here's our problem.

584
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,600
火通過窗戶向上蔓延
The fire's lapping up through the windows.

585
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:44,200
趴下
Get down! Get down!

586
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,000
那是什麼
What was that?

587
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,950
快走，大樓起火了
-Come on! -The ceiling's going!

588
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,830
他們被困住了，我們需要人手
Men trapped! We need help! Bring a line!

589
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:09,430
把他們拖出來.快點
Pull them out, pull them out!

590
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,990
滅火，控制火情
Pass the fire hose! Pass it along!

591
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,450
第二中隊緊急呼叫指揮部
Battalion Two to Forward Command. Urgent!

592
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,490
我是，請講
Forward Command, go ahead.

593
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,680
81樓發生爆炸 火勢順著電梯往上生
Explosion on 81, fire headed toward elevator banks!

594
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,120
請多派些人來
We need more crews up here fast!

595
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:38,360
好的，81樓需要職員，快去
-They need relief on 81. Hit it.

596
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:39,860
他們馬上就到
-They're on their way.

597
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:44,100
- 好了 - 你最好打電話給鄧肯
Done! Tell Duncan to stop those

598
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:47,470
叫他停止用高速電梯轉移上面的人
Tower Room people from using that express elevator,

599
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:49,230
不然會出人命的
or somebody'll get killed.

600
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:51,400
卡菲，發出第三次警報
Ring in a third alarm.

601
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,310
叫救援隊趕快過來 還有直升機
I want some rescue squads and some choppers here.

602
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:56,540
我們可以用他們把上面的人接走
We may need them to get those people down.

603
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:58,240
跟我來
Come on, Park.

604
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:02,880
- 我去81樓 - 知道了
I'll be on 81.

605
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:05,050
火勢順著主電梯向上蔓延
The fire's moving toward the main shaft.

606
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,790
用觀光電梯，最好別超載
Use the scenic elevator. Don't overload.

607
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,190
好的，道格
Okey, Doug

608
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:14,720
我不喜歡你跟我說話的口氣
I don't like how you talk to me.

609
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:16,130
- 你醉了？ - 還沒有
-You drunk? -Not yet.

610
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:17,500
那就走開
-Then get out of my way!

611
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,500
兩年前你不是這樣跟我說話的
-You didn't talk like this before.

612
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:21,330
預算超資，資金匱乏
Running over budget and out of money.

613
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:25,640
你有沒有問過我 開支200萬是怎麼省下來的
Did you ask me then to shave $2,000,000 off our electrical costs?

614
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:27,800
你住嘴，幫我疏散這些人
Shut up and help these people!

615
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,940
我問你親愛的岳父大人
-Let me ask, father-in-law-Excuse me.

616
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:32,850
我是唯一受你慫恿偷工減料的分刀商嗎
Did you encourage other subcontractors to cut corners?

617
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,850
道格原意上的400萬…
Where did you save the other 4,000,000

618
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,510
你是從哪里省下來的
in Doug's original budget?

619
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:53,560
靜一靜，請靜一靜
Please! Please!

620
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:55,300
聽我說
Hold everything.

621
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:57,600
女士們先生們，我非常抱歉
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.

622
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,170
請大家回到舞廳
Move back into the Promenade Room...

623
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:03,010
我們用觀光電梯送你們下去
...and we'll take you down by the scenic elevator.

624
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:06,980
火可能影響這些高速電梯
Now these express elevators can be activated by fire.

625
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:09,680
一旦發生短路
And with the probability of short circuits...

626
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:13,660
電梯就會停在著火的樓層
...the cars might stop on the floor where the fire is.

627
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,350
所以請大家用那邊的觀光電梯
So please, we'll use the scenic elevators over there.

628
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,760
離開這
For God's sake, get out of there!

629
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:25,160
讓開，後退
Please, back!

630
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:53,410
- 糟透了，傑克 - 是啊，已經有兩人受傷了
It looks bad, Jack. It is. I got a couple of men hurt.

631
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,970
火已經蔓延到所有的走廊
The fire's spreading.

632
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,640
我已經叫第三警隊馬上趕來 天花板怎麼了
I got a third alarm in. What about this ceiling?

633
00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:00,620
一定是剛燒著的 我去看看其他的走廊
Must have just happened. I'll check the other corridors.

634
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,620
去把天花板捅下來
Firemen, let's pull it down before it falls down.

635
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:10,220
捅啊，把火壓住
Bring it out!

636
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,920
全力滅火
Take it down!

637
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:15,200
控制住火勢
Empty all the water out.

638
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:17,570
隊長，火已經失控了 壓不住了
Chief, it's out of control.

639
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,070
再拿條水龍袋來
Bring in another line!

640
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,550
再拿條水龍袋來
Get another tank!

641
00:56:57,210 --> 00:57:00,300
安吉拉，安吉拉
Angela?Angela?

642
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,200
菲力浦
Phillip?

643
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,050
菲力浦，快還門啊
Phillip, open the door!

644
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:09,040
你有什麼聰明的主意 讓我向樓上的人解釋…
What ideas can I use upstairs...

645
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:11,310
這段時間我幹什麼去了
...to explain where I've been all this time?

646
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:15,180
我想你可以直接走過去對他說…
Well, what you might do is just...

647
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:19,020
頓肯，實在抱歉我來晚了
...walk right up to him and say, "J.D., I'm sorry for the delay...

648
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:22,650
我的秘書有些私事要辦
...but my secretary had an urgent personal problem. "

649
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,090
如果他問我什麼事 該怎麼辦呢
What happens if he asks what the problem was?

650
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:30,470
他不會問
He won't.

651
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:35,900
- 知道什麼讓我感到驚奇嗎？ - 什麼
-You know what astonishes me? -What?

652
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,310
和一個姑娘做愛…
You make love with a girl...

653
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:40,570
事過之後沒有絲毫的破綻
...and there's no visible evidence.

654
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,510
沒有發生這種事情的跡象
Nothing to mark the event.

655
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,110
你看你
Look at you.

656
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:47,620
看上去要去教堂
You look like you could be going to church.

657
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:50,490
穿這身衣服嗎
In this outfit?

658
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:53,720
我愛你
I love you.

659
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:59,800
你沒有掐滅香煙
Did you leave a cigarette burning?

660
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,470
這不是香煙
That's not a cigarette.

661
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,220
天哪
Jesus!

662
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,360
拿條毛巾來
Get some towels. Stuff them under the door.

663
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,300
- 丹. - 好
Dan?

664
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,680
是嗎
Okey

665
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:53,080
好的，就這樣
Right.

666
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,050
他們怎麼說
-What'd they say?

667
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,990
救援隊馬上就到
-Help's on the way.

668
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,600
沒什麼擔心的
There's nothing to worry about.

669
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:07,790
我們就在這等他們
We'll just sit tight and wait till they get here.

670
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:09,560
我不會驚慌失措的
I won't panic.

671
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,430
放心吧，寶貝
Not to worry, baby.

672
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:20,810
請大家到後面排好隊
Please, just join the end of the line.

673
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:23,840
請不要慌
Oh, no, ma'am. Please.

674
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:27,010
我找不到我的女兒 不知道她跑到哪里去了
But I can't find my daughter. She's here somewhere.

675
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:30,250
- 她一定會沒事的 - 她穿著紫色的裙子
-They're aware of that. -She's wearing a purple dress.

676
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,720
- 我去找她  - 我保證他們會找到她的
-I've got to find her! -I promise, they'll find her.

677
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:36,660
每次只能12個人
Now, only 12 at a time.

678
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:41,530
非常對不起，人已經滿了
I'm sorry. That's it.We'll be in the next group, maybe.

679
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,770
不會很久的
It won't be too long.

680
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:51,400
他在87層幹什麼
What's she doing on 87?

681
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,310
指揮中心嗎 我找傑尼蓋
Forward Command? I wanna speak to Jernigan.

682
01:00:58,350 --> 01:00:59,280
哈
Harry.

683
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:02,250
菲力浦
Jernigan.

684
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:08,120
什麼，見鬼，你應該派人上去
What?Damn it, man! You should've sent a man up there!

685
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:11,560
她怎麼能聽的見電話 她聽不見
How do you expect her to hear a phone call? She's deaf!

686
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:13,460
孩子當然不聾
Sure, the kids can hear!

687
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:17,260
我不知道 也許你打電話時 她正洗澡
I don't know, maybe they were in the shower when you called.

688
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,960
不，你守在那，我去接
You stay there. I'll get them down!

689
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:23,840
我的人已經上去了 我們這還需要人
All my men are committed. I need fresh crews, damn it!

690
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:28,400
87樓還有人 我去接他們
-We'll send them right up. -Still got people on 87.I'll get them down.

691
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,380
我和你一塊去
I'll give you a hand.

692
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,690
把臉轉過去
Turn your face away.

693
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:18,760
沒人來救我們是嗎
There never were any firemen, were there?

694
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,400
我那麼說是想讓你好受點
I said that to make it easier on you.

695
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,530
我把電話掐了
I switched off the phones.

696
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:31,270
電話不可能打出去
There's no way to call out.

697
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:37,350
沒人知道我們在這
Nobody knows we're up here.

698
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:42,990
我希望死在床上
Well, I always did want to die in bed.

699
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:50,220
我們誰也不會死
Nobody's going to die.

700
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:55,600
至少他們誰也發現不了 我們的關係對嗎？
At least they'll never find out about us, will they?

701
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:27,260
我跑過百米十秒的好成績
I used to run the 100 in 10 flat.

702
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:35,310
別出去
Don't go!

703
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,070
我會帶著消防隊回來的
I'll be back with the whole fire department.

704
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:46,620
我走了

705
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:11,040
丹

706
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,160
燒到了那邊的走廊

707
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:40,760
- 你沒事吧？ - 他們在堶
-You all right?

708
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,950
- 媽媽和兩個孩子 - 我們去救他們
-The mother and children are in there.-Don't worry. We'll get them out.

709
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:44,290
等一下
-Wait!

710
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:46,920
夫人，請往後退
Please, Mrs. Mueller! Please stay back.

711
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,160
- 怎麼辦？ - 我不知道，踹開吧
-What do you think? -I don't know. Give it a kick.

712
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,730
我到後面找
I'll take the back.

713
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:31,840
我找到阿爾萊特夫人了
I got Mrs. Allbright.

714
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:37,110
堶惘酗H嗎
Anybody in here?!

715
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:05,430
沒事了，孩子，沒事了，跟我走
It's okay, kid. It's okay. Come on.

716
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:27,770
他沒事了
He's okay.

717
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:30,800
- 媽媽 - 你媽媽沒事
-Mom, Mom! -Your mom's all right.

718
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:32,930
傑尼格先生送她下樓去了
Mr. Jernigan took her downstairs.

719
01:08:33,010 --> 01:08:34,840
還有人嗎？
Anybody else?

720
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:37,500
我妹妹安吉拉在哪
My sister. Where's Angela?

721
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:40,270
會找到她的
He'll get her.

722
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,390
安吉拉？
Angela?

723
01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:56,720
安吉拉？
Angela?

724
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:18,640
安吉拉？
Angela?

725
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:21,750
安吉拉？
Angela?

726
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:27,450
安吉拉？你在哪里
Angela, where are you?

727
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,760
沒事了，安吉拉
It's gonna be okay, Angela.

728
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:56,780
謝天謝地，你總算沒事了
Thank God!

729
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:03,020
我們走

730
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:38,050
等等，等等
Hold it right here. Hold it right here.

731
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:39,860
好了
-All right! -That's it.

732
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:41,870
別按暫停按鈕
Don't crush.

733
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:49,800
大家不要著急，安靜點

734
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:55,340
照這樣下去要花幾小時才能送完
It'll take hours to get everyone down.

735
01:10:55,410 --> 01:10:58,210
我建議身體強壯的男人…
Those of us with stout hearts and

736
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,980
還是走樓梯吧
trim waistlines should use the stairs.

737
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:03,180
- 走135層 - 全是下樓
-That's 135 floors. -All downhill.

738
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:26,040
火離我們很近
It's closer than they told us.

739
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:30,940
看看南面的出口 那邊可能沒火
Let's try the south exit. That might be clear.

740
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:48,000
卡洛斯
Carlos!

741
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,270
幫我們把這門打開
-Yes, sir. -Help us get this thing open.

742
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,000
- 鏽住了？ - 是啊
Is it stuck?

743
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:56,900
我來把它踢開
Here, let me try to kick it.

744
01:12:01,610 --> 01:12:04,410
- 我給保安打個電話 - 好的，先生
-I'll call security. -Yes, sir.

745
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:37,620
38分隊收到第四次警報 已經趕到
Battalion 38 responding to fourth alarm.

746
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:41,780
直升機在哪，卡菲
Where are those choppers, Kappy?

747
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:43,680
海軍已經接到通知了
Navy's been alerted.

748
01:12:46,690 --> 01:12:49,680
他們幹嘛把這鬼東西做的這麼重
Why do they make these goddamn things so heavy?

749
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,520
你還指望什麼呢，隊長？
You want it easy, chief?

750
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,530
我不知道為我們設計的防護服.
They should design a survival suit

751
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:56,120
怎麼不像為足球運動員那麼盡心
for us like for football players.

752
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:59,930
- 誰花錢看我們表演？ - 對，對
Who pays to see us play?

753
01:13:03,910 --> 01:13:05,430
開始工作吧
Let's go to work.

754
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:10,240
我需要兩個人到頂樓
I need two men up the stairwell to the tower.

755
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:12,150
那堛漯飌籉漱F 想辦法打開
The door's jammed. I want it cleared.

756
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:21,120
好吧，你們去，蒂米，你跟我來
Okay, you got it.Timmy, I want you with me.

757
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:24,490
再找兩個人讓他們 帶足30分鐘的氧氣
Get two men with 30 minutes of air. Kappy?

758
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:27,050
玻璃會像天女散花到處亂飛
Glass will be sailing everywhere.

759
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:30,900
你馬上通知員警 向路障再擴大四個街區
Tell the police to move those barricades four blocks back.

760
01:13:30,970 --> 01:13:32,730
- 好的. - 我們走
-Got it. -Let's hit it.

761
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,710
嗨，我是保安，堶惘酗H嗎？
Yo! Security guard. Anyone here?

762
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,390
堶惘酗H嗎
Hello. Security.

763
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:03,100
哦，我差點忘了
Say, kitty, almost missed you.

764
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:13,240
別碰著牆
Keep away from the walls.

765
01:14:14,410 --> 01:14:16,350
牆那邊有火
There's fire on the other side.

766
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:31,510
等一下
Wait a minute.

767
01:14:36,190 --> 01:14:38,960
煤氣管斷裂，快閃開
It's a ruptured gas line. Get back!

768
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:01,210
哦，我的天
Oh, my God!

769
01:15:57,610 --> 01:16:00,240
你們能下來嗎
Is there any way you can get down?

770
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:03,540
- 我想我能 - 菲力浦
I think I can.Phillip!

771
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:05,910
讓他試試吧
Let him try.

772
01:16:07,550 --> 01:16:09,040
沒有別的辦法
There's no other way.

773
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:41,320
來吧，菲力浦，沒問題
Come on, Phillip! Come on.That part's easy.

774
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:52,550
來吧，別著急，腳要踩穩
Come on, boy. Easy does it.Get your foot over there.

775
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:03,140
加油，菲力浦，加油
Ease down. Come on, Phillip. Come on, Phillip!

776
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:20,760
馬上就要到了
It's just a couple of inches away now.

777
01:17:20,830 --> 01:17:22,220
來
There you go.

778
01:17:22,290 --> 01:17:25,130
別急，菲力浦
Easy.Easy.

779
01:17:27,830 --> 01:17:30,060
別往下看
Don't look down!

780
01:17:31,870 --> 01:17:35,030
來，別慌
Come on.

781
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:37,600
我接著你
I gotcha. I gotcha.

782
01:17:47,190 --> 01:17:49,180
我們應該接受消防訓練
We were supposed to have fire drills,

783
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:50,980
可是沒有人告訴我們該怎麼辦
but nobody ever told me anything.

784
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:54,390
他們答應過要給我們進行消防訓練
They said we would have fire drills.

785
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:56,050
可根本不是那麼回事
But they never did.

786
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,990
沒事的，沒事的
It's going to be all right.

787
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:28,460
別怕
It's going to be all right.

788
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:57,710
你沒事吧
You all right?

789
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:03,260
我上來沒問題 可下去就不行了
You know, I had a I got up, but I'll have trouble getting down.

790
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:05,420
你能不能幫忙
Can you help me?

791
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:09,190
抱緊我的脖子
Could you just hold on around my neck, real tight?

792
01:19:09,270 --> 01:19:10,760
不
No

793
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:14,300
別怕，試試
Come on. Give it a try.

794
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:21,010
用手摟緊我的脖子 告訴我該怎麼辦
Just put your arms around me, and you tell me what to do.

795
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:22,510
把她放在我的腰上
Put her legs down.

796
01:19:23,950 --> 01:19:26,920
摟緊了，摟緊了
Hold on tight.

797
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:28,950
摟緊
Hold on real tight, now.

798
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:30,750
摟緊

01:20:55,940 --> 01:20:57,600
這個傷患放在這

808
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:13,050
米爾勒夫人，你別怕

抓緊

813
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:38,830
腳再往外伸一點
Try to get your hand over there.

814
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:46,750
很快就要到了

誰也沒辦法下去了

826
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:16,000
天哪，沒有退路了

-Get me Chief O'Hallorhan. -I'm trying to get through now.

831
01:24:58,450 --> 01:25:00,880
- 我們不能下去了？ - 不行，火在往下蔓
Can't we go down?The fire's below us.

832
01:25:00,950 --> 01:25:03,680
我們只能通向頂樓舞廳
We gotta go up, underneath the Promenade Room.

833
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:05,190
快走
Come on!

834
01:25:16,330 --> 01:25:17,730
吉姆，接電話

835
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,670
檢查你們的通風系統，傑克？

836
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:21,710

01:25:21,810 --> 01:25:23,800
我會再送上一車設備

838
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:26,340
扯掉天花板 打開另一邊通風口
Pull this ceiling, and vent that other side.

839
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:28,930
找你的，隊長，飛機指揮官 是直升飛機的事

841
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:34,450
傑克，我會叫人上去幫你們的
Jack, I know you've been hitting it.I'm getting relief for you and your men.

842
01:25:40,690 --> 01:25:42,390
我是奧霍羅漢，你是哪位？
Who am I speaking to?

843
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:45,020
我是弗萊克指揮官 美國海軍空軍救援隊
Chief Flaker, sir. U.S. Navy, Air Rescue.

844
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:47,720

It's about time. We need your rescue choppers.

845
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:48,960
我馬上下達命令
Right away.

846
01:25:49,030 --> 01:25:52,260
我想挨著你的指揮部建立指揮中心 可以嗎
Our communications will be near the Forward Command center.

847
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:55,200
不，太危險了 離電梯遠點
No, too dangerous. Stay out of those elevators.

848
01:25:55,310 --> 01:25:57,570
那好，先生，我們只好從樓梯跑上去
Then, sir, we'll just trot up the stairs.

849
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:00,610
那你就跑79層吧
You'll just trot right up to 79, huh?

850
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:03,810
- 我們在大堂待命，先生 - 謝謝
Standing by in the lobby.Thank you.

851
01:26:32,580 --> 01:26:35,070
該死的.
This ain't gonna help any!

852
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:44,210
他們聽不到我們 堶惘300個人
They won't hear us in there. There's 300 people!

853
01:26:44,290 --> 01:26:47,280
這個防火門厚2英尺半
It's a fire door. It's over 2.5 inches thick.

854
01:26:48,930 --> 01:26:53,630
- 也許我們可以從空調管道下去 - 我們能不能跟著你？
I could crawl through the duct.Will we be able to go with you?

855
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:57,760
那要經過一個豎井 直接從135樓到頂層
That leads to a pipe shaft that's 135 floors straight down.

856
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:00,960
用這個
This

857
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:04,040
菲力浦，你要好好照顧兩位女士
Phillip, take care of these ladies.

858
01:27:04,110 --> 01:27:06,240
你要對她們付責任
They're your responsibility now.

859
01:28:17,310 --> 01:28:18,710
好的，等一下
All right, I'll tell him.

860
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:22,710
- 隊長？ - 65樓怎麼樣？
-How is it on 65?

861
01:28:22,790 --> 01:28:25,690
- 他們正在控制 - 下面仍然有火
-They're containing it. Well, it's still below us.

862
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:28,880
我們去看看 注意小心電線
Let's take a look. Okay, watch the electrics.

863
01:28:48,110 --> 01:28:49,550
過來
Come here!

864
01:28:50,650 --> 01:28:54,340
發電機燒了 備用機應該啟動了
The master generator's blown.The backup should've kicked on.

865
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:56,650
看看怎麼還沒有動靜
See what's holding up our starters.

866
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:10,300
怎麼回事
What happened?

867
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:17,040
我們到底在哪
Where the hell are we?

868
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:27,880
- 推呀！ - 我在推

869
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:36,220
保安部，我是鄧肯 是主發電機停了嗎
Security, this is Duncan. Have the main breakers gone?

870
01:29:39,830 --> 01:29:41,700
整個系統癱瘓了
The whole system's failed.

871
01:29:41,770 --> 01:29:44,560
知道來這的消防隊走到哪了
What's the last report on the firemen getting here?

872
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,330
快到了
Are they on their way?

873
01:29:49,940 --> 01:29:51,640
等等
Hold on to me a second.

874
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:33,050
等等
Hold on!

875
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:41,050
- 天哪，那是我們的人！ - 哦，天哪
Christ! That's one of our men!Oh, God!

876
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:45,490
好，我們順著繩子爬下去
Go down by rope.

877
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:47,260
注意安全
Better get it.

878
01:30:47,330 --> 01:30:48,630
長官
Sir?

879
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:52,160
我們得把它修好 下到65層跳到電梯頂上
We'll rappel down to 65 and use the top of that elevator

880
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:53,760
我們從那出去
as an exit.

881
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:56,030
不能試著把這門打開嗎
Why not pry open the doors at this level?

882
01:30:57,640 --> 01:30:59,910
我看不行
I don't think so.

883
01:30:59,980 --> 01:31:03,710
我不行，我會掉下去的
I can't make it.I'll fall. I know I'll fall.

884
01:31:06,150 --> 01:31:09,520
那好，你第一個下
Then you better go first.

885
01:31:09,590 --> 01:31:12,780
這樣你掉下去 就不會帶上我們
That way, when you fall, you won't take any of us with you.

886
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:27,090
開始吧
Let's go to work.

887
01:31:37,650 --> 01:31:39,580
檢查那邊的走廊
Check all rooms in that corridor.

888
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:42,420
把這邊的房間門打開
Check this room.

889
01:31:47,690 --> 01:31:49,060
把它踢開
Tear it down.

890
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:51,690
看，和學校上訓練課教的一樣
See? Just like we taught you in training.

891
01:32:53,790 --> 01:32:55,520
來，把它打開
Open it up.

892
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:08,500
我聽見了，我明白
Of course I read you!

893
01:33:08,570 --> 01:33:11,770
我現在不知道他在哪 如果看見他 我會轉告他的
I don't know where he is, but if I see him, I'll tell him.

894
01:33:13,740 --> 01:33:16,240
投入火海 比逃離火海容易的多
-Must be an easier way to get to a fire.

895
01:33:16,310 --> 01:33:18,870
- 對我們不是 - 邁克，你跑哪去了
-Not for us. -Where've you been?

896
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:20,710
來的路上遇到了點小麻煩
-We had trouble getting here.

897
01:33:20,780 --> 01:33:23,080
海軍飛行指揮官需要你馬上到大堂去
The Navy flight commander needs you.

898
01:33:23,150 --> 01:33:25,120
65樓，要我走下去
Just walk 65 floors down?

899
01:33:25,220 --> 01:33:28,250
只要走五樓 你就可以到60樓用輔助電梯
Only five. A freight elevator on 60's running auxiliary power.

900
01:33:28,330 --> 01:33:31,020
- 你能控制嗎？ - 我看沒問題
-Got it controlled? -Getting there.

這是你的人嗎
This one of your men?

904
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:43,860
丹.比奇洛，不是消防隊員
"Dan Bigelow. " Nope.Must be a civilian.

905
01:33:51,050 --> 01:33:53,380
奧霍羅漢他馬上就到
Okay to O'Hallorhan. He's on his way.

906
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:23,040
- 你看！ - 那兒還有一架！
Look!There's another one there!

907
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:53,170
卡洛斯，電話給我，好嗎
Carlos, give me that security phone, will you?

908
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:57,610
- 羅伯茨先生，你怎麼上來了？ - 以後再跟你說吧
How'd you get in here?I'll give it to you later.

909
01:34:58,850 --> 01:35:02,340
幫我接奧霍羅漢 沒關係，找誰都得
Give me O'Hallorhan.Anybody'll do.

910
01:35:02,450 --> 01:35:06,250
聽著，南面南區的通道被堵死了 是水泥
Listen, the south stairwell is blocked. Cement, for chrissake!

911
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,590
你能不能派人上來把它打開？
Can you send somebody up to break it loose?

912
01:35:10,390 --> 01:35:12,020
已經派人上來了？ 怎麼
They're on their way? How--?

913
01:35:13,900 --> 01:35:14,860
好吧
Okey

914
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:18,260
糟了，艾爾卡
Oh, my Lord, Elke.

915
01:35:18,340 --> 01:35:22,000
可憐的小貓，它還在公寓堜O
My poor cat.She's still in the apartment.

916
01:35:22,070 --> 01:35:24,560
不要緊，火不會燒到那
I'm sure the fire didn't get up that high yet.

917
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:26,670
它一定會沒事的
She'll be all right.

918
01:35:32,980 --> 01:35:35,040
- 你們好 - 你好

-How're you doing? -We're fine. Glad to see you.

920
01:35:38,220 --> 01:35:40,950
就是那扇門，它被水泥封死了
That's the door right there. It's blocked with cement.

921
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:42,080
好
Ok

922
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:54,500
我們就去把那玩意兒炸掉
We're gonna have to blow that thing.

923

讓所有的人躲開
Get everybody clear.

927
01:36:13,490 --> 01:36:16,320
你只有30秒鐘，明白嗎？

Step back, please. We're blowing the door.

932
01:36:37,310 --> 01:36:38,750
好的，蹲著
Okay, get down low.

933
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:47,020
你們用什麼炸藥？
-What kind of explosives are you using?

934
01:36:47,090 --> 01:36:50,650
是塑膠炸藥.C- 4. 能把任何東西炸個洞
-It's plastic C-4. Blow a hole in anything.

935
01:37:02,670 --> 01:37:05,330
來，把這個照亮
Here, shine this on the bag for me.

936
01:37:07,110 --> 01:37:08,940
好的，放到那邊
That's it. Keep it up here.

937
01:37:11,980 --> 01:37:15,750
- 是不是會?的一聲？ - 不用擔心，孩子
Is there gonna be a bang?Nothing for you to worry about, baby.

938
01:37:15,820 --> 01:37:17,250
你會很安全的
You'll be safe.

939
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:22,390
都準備好了嗎？
Okay, everybody ready?

940
01:37:40,740 --> 01:37:43,140
快走，夥計們
Good going, Brian.

941
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:44,910
嗨
Hey

942
01:37:46,420 --> 01:37:47,910
你沒事吧？
You all right?

943
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:01,730
我是詹姆士.鄧肯. 我們能不能從這下去？
I'm James Duncan. Can we get down that way?

944
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:04,890
沒希望了，先生.樓梯全被炸毀了
No, not a chance, sir. The stairway below is completely gone.

945
01:38:23,050 --> 01:38:25,020
女士們先生們，聽我說
Everyone, listen!

946
01:38:25,090 --> 01:38:27,250
大家安靜下來 聽我說
-Hold it down! -Listen!

947
01:38:29,060 --> 01:38:31,150
情況是這樣的 消防部門通知我說…
I've been informed that there's no possibility...

948
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:35,060
我們不能從樓梯口下去
...of using this stairway to get out.

949
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:37,960
我，非常抱歉
Now, I'm sorry.

950
01:38:42,110 --> 01:38:46,470
帕提！我們還有希望離開這
Patty!There's still a chance we can get out of here.

951
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:50,810
你沒有聽見我爸爸說的話？ 這條路走不通
Didn't you hear what my father said? You can't get out that way.

952
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:53,710
你到底跟不跟我走？
Are you coming or not?

953
01:38:56,050 --> 01:38:57,110
不
No

954
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:02,850
如果你想得到批准再逃命的話 隨你的便
If you have to wait for permission to save your own life, go ahead.

955
01:39:04,330 --> 01:39:06,060
- 我要走 - 羅傑，你…
-I'm getting out. -Roger, you... .

956
01:39:11,970 --> 01:39:14,700
我們就快要死了

957
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:46,270
快！快！
Come on!Come on!

958
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:51,110
我們到那邊去 你們倆負責頂棚
Let's go. You guys, hose the ceiling.

959
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:54,300
你倆，到那堶悼h！
You two, in there!

960
01:39:59,980 --> 01:40:01,950
我猜你准以為我會失約
-I guess you thought I stood you up.

961
01:40:02,020 --> 01:40:03,920
有過這念頭
-It crossed my mind.

962
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:07,550
- 你真的沒事嗎？
You sure you're all right?

963
01:40:09,830 --> 01:40:13,850
道格，那些直升機  它們能救我們出去，是嗎？
Those helicopters, they'll get us out of here, won't they?

964
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:16,230
如果風不太大的話
Sure they will if there's not too much wind.

965
01:40:18,170 --> 01:40:19,570
一部份人
Some party.

966
01:40:21,370 --> 01:40:22,600
道格…
Nuge

967
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:31,980
你們還想要點什麼？
Can I get you anything else?

968
01:40:32,050 --> 01:40:33,450
不要？
No

969
01:40:56,940 --> 01:40:58,170
該死的！
Damn

970
01:41:02,710 --> 01:41:07,120
直升機已經準備好了 但是樓頂的強風加大了降落的危險性
The choppers are here, but the winds make a landing attempt too risky.

971
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:09,850
還能抽幾個人嗎 讓他們到皮爾斯大廈樓頂
Get some men on top of the Peerless Building...

972
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:12,620
我想在那兒安個吊索 直達樓頂舞廳
...and get a breeches buoy to the Promenade Room.

973
01:41:12,690 --> 01:41:15,210
風這麼大，我們無法把繩索射上去
We can't shoot a line that far in this wind.

974
01:41:15,290 --> 01:41:18,990
- 從升直機上射也不行嗎 - 我馬上去準備
Why not shoot it from a chopper?I'll get right on it.

975
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:23,520
鄧？
-Doc?

976
01:41:23,630 --> 01:41:25,460
隊長，他被天花板壓在身上
-Chief, the ceiling fell in on him.

977
01:41:25,540 --> 01:41:28,470
找到他的時候，他被埋在熱海中
By the time I got to him, he was covered with hot stuff.

978
01:41:54,430 --> 01:41:57,060
我真夠丟人現眼的？
Pretty ridiculous spectacle, right?

979
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,870
- 那兒根本下不去 - 謝天謝地，你沒事
-There's no way down. -Thank God you're all right.

980
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:06,600
- 我們該怎麼辦啊？ - 我知道我該怎麼辦
-Oh, Roger, what are we gonna go? -I know what I'm gonna do.

981
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:08,580
喝個大醉
Get quietly drunk.

982
01:42:11,380 --> 01:42:14,910
如果你該對此負責任 我知道你的感覺
If you're responsible for this, I know what you must be feeling.

983
01:42:14,980 --> 01:42:17,680
你不懂那個詞的含義
You don't know the meaning of the word.

984
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:19,310
- 負責任？ - 感覺！
-Responsible? -Feeling!

985
01:42:19,390 --> 01:42:23,190
負責你懂的很多 那是家族的特點
You know about responsibility. It's a family trait.

986
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:26,630
鄧肯家族的人都是負責的佼佼者 至少表面上是
Duncans are big in that department, at least on the surface.

987
01:42:26,730 --> 01:42:27,890
這不公平！
That's not fair!

988
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,360
我不認為我們有責任感有什麼錯誤
I don't think it's wrong to feel a sense of duty.

989
01:42:31,430 --> 01:42:35,700
有時候你說話時眉毛一揚
Sometimes, when you turn the exact same phrase...

990
01:42:35,770 --> 01:42:38,210
那種口氣
...Iift an eyebrow in the exact same way...

991
01:42:38,270 --> 01:42:40,610
那種動作
...I see and I hear your father.

992
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:42,440
跟你父親一模一樣！
The two of you, one!

993
01:42:42,510 --> 01:42:46,850
就像是棵小樹在一棵大樹的樹蔭下 受到庇護一樣
Like a big tree and a little tree in its shade, where the acorn fell.

994
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:52,220
羅傑，我到你面前來 是因為我認為你需要我
Roger, I came over here to you because I thought you might need me.

995
01:42:56,630 --> 01:42:58,030
現在…
Right now...

996
01:42:59,230 --> 01:43:02,200
我最需要的是…是這個
what I need most...is this.

997
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:10,330
我向自己保證 如果再見到你
I promised myself if I ever saw you again,

998
01:43:10,410 --> 01:43:11,900
我一定向你坦白一切
I'd make a full confession.

999
01:43:11,980 --> 01:43:14,270
謝謝你，不用了
No, but thank you.

1000
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:16,740
可是你一點兒也不瞭解我
-But you don't know anything about me.

1001
01:43:16,810 --> 01:43:18,300
我瞭解你
-But I do.

1002
01:43:18,350 --> 01:43:20,280
你身無分文
You're penniless...

1003
01:43:20,350 --> 01:43:23,510
你在法國南方沒有別墅
...you have no villa in the south of France...

1004
01:43:23,590 --> 01:43:26,580
沒有古董，沒有名畫
...no antiques coming, no paintings.

1005
01:43:26,660 --> 01:43:28,820
不過，我不在乎
But, Harlee, I don't care.

1006
01:43:31,190 --> 01:43:34,720
我是個卑鄙小人.華而不實的騙子
I'm a cheap tinhorn. A two-bit con man.

1007
01:43:34,830 --> 01:43:38,290
你不卑鄙，只是不夠成功
Not cheap. Maybe unsuccessful.

1008
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:40,840
我知道你不是成心的
But you see, your heart isn't in it.

1009
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:43,460
你騙了人心堣]不好受…
How can you cheat people effectively...

1010
01:43:43,540 --> 01:43:45,840
好怎麼能假的像呢？
...if you don't enjoy cheating them?

1011
01:43:45,910 --> 01:43:48,780
我今天帶你來想買你1000股
I came here to sell you 1 000 shares

1012
01:43:48,850 --> 01:43:50,900
阿納海姆公司股票
in Greater Anaheim Power and Light!

1013
01:43:50,980 --> 01:43:52,680
那是一筆好投資嗎？
Is it a good investment?

1014
01:43:52,750 --> 01:43:55,340
根本沒有阿納海姆公司
There is no Greater Anaheim Power and Light.

1015
01:43:55,420 --> 01:43:57,580
只有我自己印的證書
Only the certificate I had printed.

1016
01:43:57,650 --> 01:44:00,280
我要說你一定很欣賞這古董
I think you'd have admired the artwork.

1017
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:01,880
多精美的雕刻
Beautiful engraving.

1018
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:03,590
我想看看
I'd like to see it.

1019
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:06,730
在我上衣口袋
It's in my jacket.

1020
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:10,100
我把它脫了 扔在了別的地方
I took the jacket off. It was needed elsewhere.

1021
01:44:10,170 --> 01:44:11,790
你看我說的是什麼？
You see what I mean?

1022
01:44:11,870 --> 01:44:15,030
我甚至不能給你一張偽造的股票證書
I can't even deliver a phony stock certificate.

1023
01:44:18,810 --> 01:44:20,470
聽見我說的話了嗎？
Did you hear what I said?

1024
01:44:22,110 --> 01:44:23,740
聽見了
Every word.

1025
01:44:24,950 --> 01:44:28,780
那你告訴我你很震驚 至少是很失望
Then tell me you're shocked or at least disappointed.

1026
01:44:28,850 --> 01:44:31,580
- 可我沒有 - 別否認！
-But I'm not. -You must be!

1027
01:44:31,650 --> 01:44:33,710
我沒有，哈瑞
Harlee, I'm not.

1028
01:44:38,930 --> 01:44:40,120
好啊
Okey

1029
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:51,400
我去去就來
I'll be right back.

1030
01:44:52,810 --> 01:44:55,470
我和道格說幾句，好嗎
Give me a few minutes with Doug, will you, dear?

1031
01:44:55,550 --> 01:44:56,840
當然
Sure.

1032
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:09,580
威爾.吉丁斯死了
Will Giddings is dead.

1033
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:13,960
他20分鐘前死的
He died 20 minutes ago.

1034
01:45:19,340 --> 01:45:20,930
天?
Oh, boy.

1035
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:28,140
誰知道天亮前還會死多少人
I wonder how many more will be dead tomorrow?

1036
01:45:28,210 --> 01:45:30,180
我總以為我們蓋的樓…
I thought we were building something...

1037
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:33,740
能讓人們在堶惘w全的工作和生活！
...where people could work, live and be safe.

1038
01:45:33,820 --> 01:45:35,250
如果你要削減成本
If you had to cut costs

1039
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:37,810
幹嘛不減掉幾層樓？
why didn't you cut floors instead of corners?

1040
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:41,080
你聽著 
Now listen.

1041
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:43,790
我是決定…
Any decisions that were made for

1042
01:45:43,790 --> 01:45:46,520
更換了一些建材…
the use of alternate building materials. .

1043
01:45:46,630 --> 01:45:50,620
這麼做是因為我是建材商 我有權作決定…
...were made because l, as a builder, have a right to make those decisions.

1044
01:45:50,730 --> 01:45:54,260
只要我符合標準 可是，我深信我已經做到了這一點！
If I remain within the building code, and goddamn it, I did!

1045
01:45:54,340 --> 01:45:56,460
還是老一套，建築標準
Oh, here we go again!

1046
01:45:56,540 --> 01:45:58,100
建築標準
The building code. Come on.

1047
01:45:58,170 --> 01:46:00,840
每次有麻煩你總是拿它當藉口
That's a standard cop-out when you're in trouble!

1048
01:46:00,910 --> 01:46:03,170
我從通風管道爬過來
I was crawling around up there.

1049
01:46:03,250 --> 01:46:05,650
那些材料都不是阻燒材料！
The duct holes weren't fire-stopped!

1050
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:09,280
走廊堥S有防火門
Corridors without fire doors and the sprinklers won't work.

1051
01:46:09,350 --> 01:46:12,410
電力系統又有什麼用呢？
And an electrical system that's good for what?

1052
01:46:12,490 --> 01:46:14,720
我看只能引起火災
I mean, it's good for starting fires!

1053
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:18,580
當時我又在哪？
Where was I when all this was going on?

1054
01:46:18,690 --> 01:46:22,530
我也有罪 我和你跟你那該死的女婿一樣
Because I'm just as guilty as you and that goddamn son-in-law of yours!

1055
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:27,070
害死人的人該叫什麼？
What do they call it when you kill people?

1056
01:46:38,410 --> 01:46:40,010
小心，往上噴

1057
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:49,950
- 是誰？ - 是隊長
-Who is it? -Chief O'Hallorhan.

1058
01:46:50,030 --> 01:46:51,360
出什麼事了？
-What happened?

1059
01:46:51,460 --> 01:46:55,230
中央走廊發生爆炸 我們已經發出第五次警報
-Part of the central corridor just blew. We've got in the fifth alarm.

1060
01:46:55,300 --> 01:46:57,730
直升機呢
The helicopters?

1061
01:46:57,800 --> 01:46:59,170
風太大了，他們無法降落
It's too windy.

1062
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:02,730
所以我們想在舞廳和 皮爾斯大廈之間拉一條吊索
We'll set up the breeches buoy on the Peerless Building.

1063
01:47:03,910 --> 01:47:05,500
需要我們做什麼
What can we do to help?

1064
01:47:05,580 --> 01:47:08,770
把窗戶邊所有易燃物都搬開
Move your combustible material away from the window.

1065
01:47:09,980 --> 01:47:11,310
好的，明白了
Okay, gotcha.

1066
01:47:25,130 --> 01:47:28,120
- 沒有在窗簾 - 好的，讓我們把它扯下來
There's nobody on those drapes. Let's get them.

1067
01:47:28,230 --> 01:47:30,060
你們過來
Jake, give me a hand.

1068
01:48:09,470 --> 01:48:12,530
- 找到她了？ - 電話都不通啊
Did you reach her?The phones are all out.

1069
01:48:13,710 --> 01:48:16,700
再等一會兒 我們就能回家了
Just a little while longer, and we'll all be home together.

1070
01:48:18,180 --> 01:48:21,120
能和她說下幾句話就好了
If only I could have talked to her.

1071
01:48:21,180 --> 01:48:23,520
讓她知道我們在想她…
Let her know we were thinking of her.

1072
01:48:25,550 --> 01:48:29,580
告訴她… 她是我們的寶貝女兒
Told her how precious she is to us.

1073
01:48:34,060 --> 01:48:36,220
她還是個孩子
She's still such a child.

1074
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:39,030
她甚至不知道…
She doesn't even know

1075
01:48:39,100 --> 01:48:41,830
我把保險箱的鑰匙放在哪
where I keep the key to the safety deposit box.

1076
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:43,840
她怎麼開呢？
How will she be able to get into it?

1077
01:48:46,380 --> 01:48:47,900
我是說…
I mean...

1078
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,770
需要的時候
...if she should have to.

1079
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:56,380
別胡思亂想了
The things you think of.

1080
01:48:57,850 --> 01:48:59,340
能幫我一把嗎？
Do you wanna help me?

1081
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:08,230
好的
-Here he is. -The wind's down a little.

1082
01:49:08,300 --> 01:49:11,490
隊長，現在風小了點 我們想試試降落
We're gonna try for a landing.

1083
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:14,260
接通羅伯茨，我要和他通話
Get Roberts.

1084
01:49:19,910 --> 01:49:22,340
- 是我 - 讓十個人上樓頂
Get 10 people on the roof.

1085
01:49:22,410 --> 01:49:25,900
其餘的十人一組 我們開始準備空運
Have the rest stand by.We're gonna start airlifting.

1086
01:49:26,020 --> 01:49:27,610
我的
Will do.

1087
01:49:31,490 --> 01:49:34,180
把這些放到那 有的時候好拿
Put these over there.

1088
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:37,950
給我一打紙和一支筆 再拿一個白蘭地酒杯
Give me a pad of paper and a pencil.Give me that brandy snifter too.

1089
01:49:38,030 --> 01:49:41,090
- 他們準備降落？ - 他們想試一試
-Doug, are they going to land? -They're gonna try.

1090
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:44,390
我們先送孩子 然後是婦女
We'll send the kids out first, then the women.

1091
01:49:44,470 --> 01:49:47,060
在紙上寫信號 100個左右
Number these up to 100 or so.

1092
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:48,660
摩天樓輪盤賭
High-rise roulette.

1093
01:49:48,740 --> 01:49:51,000
摩天樓輪盤賭 說得對
High-rise roulette. That's right.

1094
01:49:51,110 --> 01:49:53,910
道格，我不再有機會告訴你
-There may not be time to tell you -There will be.

1095
01:49:56,180 --> 01:49:57,740
去通知他們
I'll go tell everybody.

1096
01:49:57,850 --> 01:50:00,480
你寫好後，讓他們抓鬮
Pass those out when you're ready.

1097
01:50:27,550 --> 01:50:30,880
記住上面風很大 尤其是直升機下降時
There'll be a lot of wind up there,

1098
01:50:30,950 --> 01:50:32,710
大家要待在一起，別散開
so everybody stay in one group. Come on.

1099
01:50:49,630 --> 01:50:51,430
靠後！靠後！
Stay back, stay back!

1100
01:50:57,010 --> 01:50:58,130
小心！
Look out!

1101
01:51:42,150 --> 01:51:44,020
羅伯茨，羅伯茨
Roberts! Roberts!

1102
01:51:44,090 --> 01:51:46,820
隊長要找你講話
Chief O'Hallorhan wants to speak to you.

1103
01:51:46,890 --> 01:51:50,230
讓一下 對不起，讓我們過去！
All right, make way. Coming through, coming through!

1104
01:51:55,270 --> 01:51:56,790
他來了
Here he is now.

1105
01:51:59,370 --> 01:52:00,360
聽著
Yeah

1106
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:03,700
聽著，羅伯茨，我知道飛行員死了
Roberts, I know those pilots are dead, and l--

1107
01:52:03,810 --> 01:52:06,110
上面一片混亂
God, it was just awful up there.

1108
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:10,580
現在吊索是我們最大的希望
Listen, our best chance now is the breeches buoy.

1109
01:52:10,650 --> 01:52:13,310
讓我的那兩個人打破玻璃窗
I told my two firemen to knock out a window.

1110
01:52:13,390 --> 01:52:15,880
從直升飛機上給你們發射一根繩子
We'll try to shoot a line from a chopper.

1111
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:17,980
好的
Okey

1112
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:26,160
你們誰帶剪刀了嗎？
Hey, one of you guys got a pair of clippers?

1113
01:52:26,230 --> 01:52:29,760
- 我有，要它幹什麼？ - 我得想個辦法
-Sure, what do you want them for? -I want to try something.

1114
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:45,120
消防隊員要打破玻璃窗 為了安全，請大家後退
Step back. The firemen are gonna knock out the windows.

1115
01:52:46,150 --> 01:52:47,580
請大家後退一些
Step back and you won't get hurt.

1116
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:41,720
大家靜靜，請聽我說？
May I have your attention, please?

1117
01:54:43,490 --> 01:54:46,520
我們起動了一台外面的引力電梯
We've activated a gravity brake on that outside elevator.

1118
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:49,900
它沒有足夠的動力再上來 但至少能把12個人送下去
There's no power to bring it back up, but at least we can get 12 people out.

1119
01:54:49,970 --> 01:54:51,630
哪12個？
Which 12?

1120
01:54:51,740 --> 01:54:55,670
剛才那十個上樓頂的 再加上兩個
The same group that was up on the roof and two additions.

1121
01:54:55,770 --> 01:54:57,740
救孩子的那名女士和消防員…
The woman who saved the children's lives and a fireman!

1122
01:54:57,840 --> 01:55:00,710
我要一個受過訓練的人
I want a trained man in there.

1123
01:55:02,910 --> 01:55:04,810
你去吧，快點上電梯吧
All right, let's move it out!

1124
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:16,790
瑪姬，給你，拿著這個 你就可以走了
Marge!Take this. Take it! You can get out! Go on.

1125
01:55:16,860 --> 01:55:18,690
你在做什麼？
What are you doing?

1126
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:22,300
對不起
I'm sorry.

1127
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:28,690
我要你離開這兒
I want you out of here.

1128
01:55:28,770 --> 01:55:32,000
那樣的話你就不用擔心我了？ 難道我在下面就不會擔心你嗎？
So you can stop worrying about me? What about me worrying about you?

1129
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:35,340
那樣你才能幫助我 親愛的，幫幫我
It's the only way you can help me.Help me.

1130
01:55:48,260 --> 01:55:52,020
如果…如果你讓我去北極
If you asked me to go to the North Pole...

1131
01:55:52,100 --> 01:55:55,900
或者是荒無人煙的沙漠，我答應你
...or even the cliffs of Mendocino, I'd go.

1132
01:55:55,970 --> 01:55:58,060
我明天向你提出，怎麼樣？
What if I ask you tomorrow?

1133
01:56:08,350 --> 01:56:09,710
請吧
Please.

1134
01:56:13,480 --> 01:56:16,150
- 夫人，我來抱她 - 謝謝你
-Ma'am, I'll take her. -Thank you.

1135
01:56:16,220 --> 01:56:18,050
- 跟我來，菲力浦 - 好的
Come on, Phillip.

1136
01:56:20,660 --> 01:56:23,420
以後我再也不會讓你離開我了
I'll never let you go anywhere without me again.

1137
01:56:23,490 --> 01:56:26,520
我再也不想離開你，親愛的
I don't want to.Ever again.

1138
01:56:30,270 --> 01:56:32,760
- 我去大堂找你 - 我等你
-I'll meet you in the lobby. -I'll be waiting.

1139
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:35,240
還有一位女士沒到
We're still a lady short.

1140
01:56:35,310 --> 01:56:37,830
- 你一定要走 - 可我不想離開你
-You've gotta go. -I don't want to leave you.

1141
01:56:37,940 --> 01:56:40,600
親愛的，我不會有事的 我向你保證
Honey, I'll make it. I promise you.

1142
01:56:40,680 --> 01:56:42,910
我有說謊，不算數的時候嗎？
Have I ever broken a promise to you?

1143
01:56:46,420 --> 01:56:47,910
祝你好運，親愛的
Good luck, honey.

1144
01:56:49,250 --> 01:56:50,480
請吧
Please.

1145
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:53,480
準備好了嗎？
All set, everyone?

1146
01:57:02,830 --> 01:57:04,660
好了，我們走
Okay, here we go.

1147
01:58:46,970 --> 01:58:48,800
好了
Out of sight!

1148
01:58:50,610 --> 01:58:52,580
它們來了
Yeah, it's coming.

1149
01:58:52,680 --> 01:58:56,670
拽住繩子！ 往里拉！
Let's untie this, take it off, pull in the rest of the line!

1150
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:13,830
抓緊它！拴緊往里拉
All right, hold it right there!

1151
01:59:13,900 --> 01:59:16,460
抓住主纜繩
Bring in another 20 feet of that main line.

1152
01:59:16,530 --> 01:59:17,900
抓緊
Hold on

1153
01:59:26,410 --> 01:59:27,780
就這樣
That's it.

1154
01:59:29,450 --> 01:59:32,070

1155
01:59:32,150 --> 01:59:34,140
來幫一下
That's it. Hold it now. Brace yourselves.

1156
01:59:41,590 --> 01:59:43,150
當心頭
Watch your heads!

1157
01:59:46,760 --> 01:59:49,290
拉呀，再往堣@點

1158
01:59:51,900 --> 01:59:55,600
好了，先別拉
All right, let it go!Let it go!

1159
01:59:55,710 --> 01:59:57,700
栓好了
All right, go on! Take it out!

1160
02:00:11,120 --> 02:00:12,680
找個地方固定住
Okay, take ahold.

1161
02:00:23,470 --> 02:00:25,530
主纜繩系好了沒有，保險嗎
How about the main line? Secured?

1162
02:00:25,640 --> 02:00:26,900
好
Good!

1163
02:01:16,950 --> 02:01:18,110
隊長
Chief!

1164
02:01:22,230 --> 02:01:26,320
110層發生爆炸，觀光電梯脫離軌道
Explosion above 110 blew the elevator off its track.

1165
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:27,890
只靠一根剛纜吊著
It's hanging by a cable.

1166
02:01:31,070 --> 02:01:34,770
- 上面有多少人？ - 滿的，差不多12個
-How many people in it? -Loaded. I'd say about 12.

1167
02:01:41,450 --> 02:01:43,040
你打算怎麼辦
What're you gonna go?

1168
02:01:49,990 --> 02:01:51,080
弗萊克
Flaker.

1169
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:54,290
- 弗萊克 - 我在
-Flaker! -Sir?

1170
02:01:56,360 --> 02:01:59,190
能不能給我一架帶絞盤個剛纜的直升機
Can you give me a chopper with a winch and some cable?

1171
02:01:59,260 --> 02:02:02,250
送我到皮爾斯大廈樓頂去
Have them pick me up on the Peerless Building.

1172
02:02:02,330 --> 02:02:04,770
- 我們去準備 - 好的
Got it.

1173
02:02:07,470 --> 02:02:09,840
我上去用鉤子鉤住電梯
Try and get a hitch on that elevator.

1174
02:02:09,910 --> 02:02:12,430
用直升飛機把它鉤到地面
Drop it down to the deck by the chopper.

1175
02:02:22,250 --> 02:02:23,880
媽媽，媽媽
Mommy, Mommy!

1176
02:02:33,860 --> 02:02:36,260
你不哭我也不哭
I won't cry if you won't cry.

1177
02:03:26,720 --> 02:03:29,450
好了，放開她
Okay, let her go!

1178
02:03:32,060 --> 02:03:33,550
當心下面
Look out below!

1179
02:03:52,380 --> 02:03:54,740
好了，把它拉過來
All right! There's one in there!

1180
02:03:54,810 --> 02:03:56,570
拉呀
Come on! Pull it in!

1181
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:09,920
鉤住那把椅子
All right, let's haul that chair in! Come on!

1182
02:04:12,330 --> 02:04:13,630
就這樣
That's it!

1183
02:04:18,970 --> 02:04:20,630
好了，拉呀
All right, keep it going!

1184
02:04:21,610 --> 02:04:23,540
就停在這
All right, hold it right there.

1185
02:04:25,110 --> 02:04:26,630
下一個該誰了
Who's next in order?

1186
02:04:26,740 --> 02:04:28,440
是我，是我
I am. I am!

1187
02:04:28,510 --> 02:04:31,170
- 快上來 - 我怕
-Come ahead! -I can't do that.

1188
02:04:31,250 --> 02:04:32,680
沒事的
Yes, you can.

1189
02:04:36,350 --> 02:04:38,450
我會掉下去的
-I can't!

1190
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:40,150
沒事的
-Yes, you can.

1191
02:04:40,220 --> 02:04:44,130
別鬆手，別讓我掉下去
Oh, God! Don't let go of me!Don't let go of me! Don't let me fall!

1192
02:04:46,130 --> 02:04:48,260
別鬆手
Don't let go!

1193
02:04:49,430 --> 02:04:53,100
不要，別鬆手
Don't let go of me!

1194
02:04:56,010 --> 02:04:57,410
好的

1195
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:18,860
好了，到了

1196
02:05:18,930 --> 02:05:21,900
好了，放下那把椅子

1197
02:05:21,970 --> 02:05:23,900
沒事的夫人，到了

1198
02:05:26,540 --> 02:05:28,700
別鬆手
Get me out, please! Hold it right there.

1199
02:05:38,680 --> 02:05:40,710
好了，放下纜繩
Okay, lower the cable.

1200
02:05:46,090 --> 02:05:48,720
抓住鉤子，抓穩
Grab that hook!Steady.

1201
02:05:51,190 --> 02:05:54,600
帶燈了嗎
What about the torch?Lash it tight.

1202
02:06:00,340 --> 02:06:01,700
我是奧霍羅漢
-This is O'Hallorhan.

1203
02:06:01,810 --> 02:06:03,800
聽見了，隊長
-We read you, chief.

1204
02:06:03,910 --> 02:06:06,340
我要你把我個鉤子…
Pick me up with the hook...

1205
02:06:06,440 --> 02:06:09,500
送到觀光電梯的頂上
...and set me down on the scenic elevator.

1206
02:06:09,580 --> 02:06:11,710
你先把電梯吊起來…
Then you'll pick up the elevator

1207
02:06:11,780 --> 02:06:15,050
慢慢的送到地上
and gently set it down on the street.

1208
02:06:15,120 --> 02:06:17,050
你能承受這重量嗎
Can you handle the weight?

1209
02:06:17,120 --> 02:06:20,650
我想我能行
I think we can handle it. We'll find out in a hurry.

1210
02:06:21,790 --> 02:06:22,920
好
Okey

1211
02:06:41,310 --> 02:06:42,470
鉤住
Watch it!

1212
02:06:45,580 --> 02:06:46,880
好
Okey

1213
02:06:47,750 --> 02:06:49,240
出發
Take it away!

1214
02:07:18,780 --> 02:07:20,770
我們還有多長時間
How much time do we have?

1215
02:07:23,620 --> 02:07:25,350
我也不知道
I wish I knew.

1216
02:07:25,420 --> 02:07:28,020
見鬼，這樓不是你蓋的嗎
Goddamn it, Jim, you built the place!

1217
02:07:34,100 --> 02:07:37,400
我們倆恐怕都不能逃出去
I just don't think that all of us are gonna make it.

1218
02:08:34,990 --> 02:08:37,150
下一個該我了
Well, I guess I'm next.

1219
02:08:37,230 --> 02:08:39,750
你一定不允許我留在這
I don't suppose you'll let me stay.

1220
02:08:43,700 --> 02:08:45,670
好吧，回頭見
Come on. I'll see you soon.

1221
02:08:54,540 --> 02:08:55,980
我愛你
I love you.

1222
02:08:59,980 --> 02:09:01,610
放繩子
Let it go!

1223
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:00,570
它能經得住嗎
You think this'll hold it?

1224
02:10:00,640 --> 02:10:03,370
希望能，我們得割斷電梯剛纜
It'd better. We have to cut the elevator cable.

1225
02:10:12,590 --> 02:10:14,820
- 你多少號？
-What's your number? -68.

1226
02:10:14,890 --> 02:10:16,260
我是47
47.

1227
02:12:44,970 --> 02:12:46,570
快到了

1228
02:13:03,230 --> 02:13:05,290
拉姆齊夫人，到了
Here, Mrs. Ramsay,

1229
02:13:05,360 --> 02:13:07,120
你沒事了
you'll be all right now.

1230
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:08,250
請幫我個忙好嗎
-You'll be all right.

1231
02:13:08,330 --> 02:13:10,860
請告訴我丈夫我沒事
-Tell my husband I'm all right.

1232
02:13:10,930 --> 02:13:13,600
- 告訴他我沒事了 - 我會的
-Tell him I'll be all right. -I will.

1233
02:13:13,700 --> 02:13:16,300
我會等著他
-And I'll see him at home later.

1234
02:13:16,410 --> 02:13:18,400
我一定告訴他
-I will.

1235
02:13:18,510 --> 02:13:19,910
該走了
Let's go.

1236
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:29,270
她沒事了
Oh, my God, you're all right!

1237
02:13:33,490 --> 02:13:35,120
小心梯子
Watch the ladder.

1238
02:13:41,340 --> 02:13:42,730
讓開

1239
02:14:20,010 --> 02:14:23,030
嗨，邁克，副局長在叫你
Hey, Mike deputy wants to see you.

1240
02:14:35,690 --> 02:14:37,490
邁克，，我們研究了…
Mike, we've been checking

1241
02:14:37,560 --> 02:14:39,360
樓頂舞廳的情況
the situation in the Promenade Room.

1242
02:14:39,430 --> 02:14:43,020
我們認為他們只剩下17到18分鐘
We figure they've got 17 or 18 minutes left, if that.

1243
02:14:43,100 --> 02:14:46,530
用吊索把所有的人運下來需要三小時
It'll take more than 3 hours to get them down by breeches buoy.

1244
02:14:46,600 --> 02:14:49,160
如果不採取行動他們就會死
They'll die up there if something's not done.

1245
02:14:49,240 --> 02:14:50,900
我們有辦法
We might have the answer.

1246
02:14:50,970 --> 02:14:52,770
詹森先生是結構工程師
Johnson's a structural engineer.

1247
02:14:52,870 --> 02:14:54,810
告訴隊長你的計算結果
Tell the chief your calculations.

1248
02:14:54,910 --> 02:14:58,140
根據我的觀點
The structural strength of the joists in that room...

1249
02:14:58,210 --> 02:15:01,080
頂樓舞廳結構和支架的 承重力肯定能頂住爆破
...could definitely withstand the explosion.

1250
02:15:03,280 --> 02:15:04,510
什麼爆破
What explosion?

1251
02:15:06,220 --> 02:15:10,020
隊長直升機準備好了 在廣場上
Chief, we've got the copter ready.Wait a minute.

1252
02:15:10,090 --> 02:15:12,060
這件事我來處理 你回去幹你的工作吧
We'll handle that. Just get back to your job.

1253
02:15:14,530 --> 02:15:16,020
好的，先生
Yes, sir.

1254
02:15:18,300 --> 02:15:19,530
什麼爆破
What explosion?

1255
02:15:19,600 --> 02:15:23,000
我們可以將舞廳上面的蓄水池炸開
We can blow the tanks two floors above the Promenade Room.

1256
02:15:23,070 --> 02:15:26,510
那堶惘酗@百萬加侖水足以把大火撲滅
They hold 1,000,000 gallons of water. That's enough to drown the fire.

1257
02:15:30,510 --> 02:15:33,040
- 你瘋了 - 這是唯一的辦法
-You're crazy. -Mike, it's the only way.

1258
02:15:33,150 --> 02:15:37,050
你怎麼知道有效 你會把人都殺死
You could kill everybody up there.

1259
02:15:37,120 --> 02:15:38,680
我不這麼想
I don't think so.

1260
02:15:38,750 --> 02:15:40,650
你沒有想
You don't think?

1261
02:15:40,720 --> 02:15:44,320
我們內計算了壓力負荷因數以及
When you take into account the stress factors, the design--

1262
02:15:44,390 --> 02:15:46,420
好了，等一下
Wait a minute. Just hold it.

1263
02:15:46,490 --> 02:15:48,990
沒必要說那麼多了，邁克 我們已經做出了決定
We've already made the decision.

1264
02:15:49,060 --> 02:15:52,900
現在需要一個人上去裝炸藥並引爆
Someone has got to go up there, rig the charges and blow them.

1265
02:15:52,970 --> 02:15:57,600
局堨u有兩個人能勝任，你和康納斯
There's only two people qualified for that. You and Conners.

1266
02:15:57,670 --> 02:15:59,870
他們剛把康納斯送下來
They just brought Conners down.

1267
02:15:59,970 --> 02:16:02,840
正去燒傷醫院的路上
He's on his way to the burn center.

1268
02:16:02,940 --> 02:16:07,110
在目前這種情況下 我不能命令你上去
Under the circumstances, we can't order you to go up there.

1269
02:16:07,180 --> 02:16:10,840
我只能告訴你實情
I'm just laying it out for you.

1270
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:13,220
由你自己…
But you... .

1271
02:16:13,290 --> 02:16:15,380
你明白是嗎？
You see how it is, don't you?

1272
02:16:19,290 --> 02:16:21,320
那我怎麼回來了
How do I get back down?

1273
02:16:27,300 --> 02:16:28,890
盡說些廢話
Oh, shit!

1274
02:16:56,130 --> 02:16:57,620
女人全都走了
The women are gone.

1275
02:16:58,900 --> 02:17:00,630
下面該輪到我們了
We are going next.

1276
02:17:12,680 --> 02:17:17,450
你們都有號碼 你們必須按號碼走
You've all got numbers.And you're gonna take your turn.

1277
02:17:17,520 --> 02:17:19,850
如果能給大家一些安慰的話…
And if it's any consolation...

1278
02:17:23,120 --> 02:17:27,190
我將最後一個離開這 跟我女婿在一起
...I'll be the last one out of here along with my son-in-law.

1279
02:17:36,770 --> 02:17:37,830
羅伯茨

1280
02:17:37,910 --> 02:17:40,870
火已經失控 正朝你們燒過去
It's out of control. And it's coming your way.

1281
02:17:43,710 --> 02:17:45,910
你們也許只有15分鐘
You got about 15 minutes.

1282
02:17:47,580 --> 02:17:49,520
他們想了個辦法
Now, they want to try something.

1283
02:17:49,580 --> 02:17:52,250
他們想炸開你們頭上的蓄水池…
They wanna blow those water tanks above you.

1284
02:17:52,320 --> 02:17:53,950
也許能把火澆滅
They think it'll kill the fire.

1285
02:18:01,700 --> 02:18:03,990
你們怎麼能把炸彈運上來
How are they gonna get the explosives up here?

1286
02:18:05,830 --> 02:18:09,130
他們要找個該死的蠢貨運上去
They'll find some dumb son of a bitch to bring it up.

1287
02:18:16,680 --> 02:18:18,200
等等，我告訴他們
Hang on, I'll tell them.

1288
02:18:23,250 --> 02:18:27,350
他們想打開我們頭上的蓄水池把火澆滅
They want to put out the fire by blowing the water tanks above us.

1289
02:18:27,420 --> 02:18:29,480
那就意味著大量的水，鋼筋和混凝土
We'll eat a lot of water and concrete,

1290
02:18:29,560 --> 02:18:34,020
如果他們不試試 我們都會被燒焦的
but if they don't try it, we'll burn.The fire's out of control.

1291
02:18:34,100 --> 02:18:37,590
我們只有15分鐘
They think we got maybe 15 minutes.

1292
02:18:37,670 --> 02:18:41,070
也許我們有人能活下去 沒有選擇了
This way, some of us might survive. We got no options.

1293
02:18:48,240 --> 02:18:50,680
快，我們走
Come on. Let's go.

1294
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:55,640
抓住繩子
Get that line.

1295
02:19:04,690 --> 02:19:05,660
下來
Get off!

1296
02:19:06,830 --> 02:19:08,950
你瘋了，拉住繩子
-You crazy bastards! Drop this line! -Let go of me!

1297
02:19:09,030 --> 02:19:11,260
- 放開！ - 會斷的
Drop the line. It's not gonna work.

1298
02:19:12,030 --> 02:19:15,520
吊索承受不起這個重力
It won't hold everybody!

1299
02:19:16,970 --> 02:19:18,870
下來
Get off!

1300
02:19:19,510 --> 02:19:21,370
下來
Get off!

1301
02:19:21,440 --> 02:19:23,930
走開
-Get the hell out of there!

1302
02:19:27,350 --> 02:19:29,150
不，不
-Go!

1303
02:19:32,190 --> 02:19:33,780
下來
Get off.

1304
02:19:44,630 --> 02:19:45,720
隊長
Chief.

1305
02:19:47,970 --> 02:19:49,560
是我

1306
02:19:49,640 --> 02:19:51,660
吊索已經不存在了
We lost the breeches buoy.

1307
02:19:51,740 --> 02:19:54,500
這媯o生了騷亂 不過已經過去了
It was panic up here.It's under control now.

1308
02:19:56,080 --> 02:19:58,340
直升機將把我送到樓頂
I'll try and set down on the roof.

1309
02:19:58,410 --> 02:20:00,310
我需要你的幫助
I'll need you up there.

1310
02:20:00,380 --> 02:20:04,820
我知道該在哪放炸藥 但我不會安
I know where to place the charges, but I don't know how.

1311
02:20:04,890 --> 02:20:06,580
我懂
I know how.

1312
02:20:09,220 --> 02:20:10,780
好的

1313
02:20:10,860 --> 02:20:12,490
樓上見
See you up there.

1314
02:20:20,400 --> 02:20:23,300
想辦法把自己固定住
You'll have to tie yourselves down.

1315
02:20:23,370 --> 02:20:26,200
用桌布，繩子，皮帶，找到什麼用什麼
Ropes, tablecloths, belts,anything you can find!

1316
02:20:37,750 --> 02:20:41,350
我的上帝啊.別把自己跟玻璃捆在一起
For God's sakes, Carlos. Don't tie yourself up to a lot of glass.

1317
02:20:41,420 --> 02:20:42,910
那是29年的陳酒
That's the '29.

1318
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:27,660
試試
Try it.

1319
02:21:29,670 --> 02:21:31,100
很好
It's okay.

1320
02:21:36,910 --> 02:21:38,170
道格…
Doug...

1321
02:21:39,550 --> 02:21:42,340
我沒想到會發生這樣的事情
...I never thought this could happen.

1322
02:21:42,420 --> 02:21:43,540
我知道
Sure.

1323
02:24:11,600 --> 02:24:13,190
嗨

1324
02:24:13,270 --> 02:24:15,200
我們還有多少時間
-How much time you think we got?

1325
02:24:15,270 --> 02:24:17,760
十分鐘 也許更少
-Ten minutes, maybe less.

1326
02:24:17,810 --> 02:24:21,240
炸水箱的同時 必須把樓板也炸穿
We'll have to blow the floors as well as the tanks, you know.

1327
02:24:22,240 --> 02:24:24,680
好吧，這是你的雷管
All right. This is your detonator.

1328
02:24:24,750 --> 02:24:27,240
你用瞬間引爆 我用延時引爆
You're running instantaneous. I'm running delayed. Here you go.

1329
02:24:27,350 --> 02:24:30,410
拿著，這是炸藥
This is your explosive.

1330
02:24:30,480 --> 02:24:31,970
這是計時器
This is the timer.

1331
02:24:32,050 --> 02:24:33,540
待會你拿出電線
Later on, after you throw the wire...

1332
02:24:33,590 --> 02:24:37,490
我們那它劈開插入電線 定好時就可以爆炸
...we'll plug it and splice it into the timer, set it, and it blows.

1333
02:24:40,860 --> 02:24:42,520
像這樣.
Set your explosive

1334
02:24:43,630 --> 02:24:44,720
定好炸藥
like this.

1335
02:24:49,100 --> 02:24:50,870
拿好雷管…
Take your detonator,

1336
02:24:50,940 --> 02:24:52,430
拔出插頭…
pull the plug.

1337
02:24:54,070 --> 02:24:55,230
把它扔了
Toss it.

1338
02:24:59,350 --> 02:25:00,370
會了嗎
-Got it?

1339
02:25:00,480 --> 02:25:01,570
會了
-I got it.

1340
02:26:15,660 --> 02:26:18,250
- 祝你好運，回頭見 - 好的，謝謝
-Good luck. See you later. -Okay, thanks.

1341
02:27:01,340 --> 02:27:02,730
給
Here you go.

1342
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:26,720
- 你準備定幾分鐘？ - 5分鐘？
What will you set it for?Five.

1343
02:27:29,560 --> 02:27:31,290
我看來得及
I think we can make that.

1344
02:27:35,770 --> 02:27:37,070
好了
That's it.

1345
02:28:11,870 --> 02:28:14,170
快把自己捆下，快點笨蛋
Tie yourselves down, goddamn it!

1346
02:28:29,590 --> 02:28:31,180
沒有辦法穿過去
You'll never make it through there.

1347
02:28:31,260 --> 02:28:33,090
還剩多少時間
How much time?

1348
02:28:33,160 --> 02:28:34,420
3分鐘
Three and a half.

1349
02:28:35,660 --> 02:28:36,690
氧氣
Here.

1350
02:28:38,570 --> 02:28:39,730
給
Here.

1351
02:29:20,040 --> 02:29:21,410
我燒著了
I'm burning up!

1352
02:29:30,650 --> 02:29:31,950
快走
Let's go!

1353
02:29:38,690 --> 02:29:39,920
消防員
Fireman?

1354
02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:23,280
鮑勃
Bob!

1355
02:33:23,350 --> 02:33:24,610
鮑勃
Bob!

1356
02:33:25,890 --> 02:33:27,410
哦，天哪

1357
02:37:18,690 --> 02:37:21,620
對不起，她跟你在同一個電梯上
Excuse me.She was in the elevator with you.

1358
02:37:21,690 --> 02:37:23,750
一位漂亮的女士，米爾勒夫人
The fine-looking lady. Mrs. Mueller.

1359
02:37:23,820 --> 02:37:25,380
你看見了嗎
Have you seen her?

1360
02:37:27,730 --> 02:37:30,160
對不起，她死了
I'm sorry, she's dead.

1361
02:37:40,470 --> 02:37:41,630
利薩
Lisa!

1362
02:37:42,640 --> 02:37:43,700
利薩
Lisa!

1363
02:37:45,040 --> 02:37:46,240
利薩
Lisa!

1364
02:37:46,310 --> 02:37:48,010
- 克萊包尼 - 什麼？
-Claiborne! -What?

1365
02:38:39,770 --> 02:38:42,100
我不想讓你看到他
I didn't want you to see him.

1366
02:38:45,270 --> 02:38:48,760
我們誰也不能…
You know, there's nothing any of us

1367
02:38:48,880 --> 02:38:50,370
讓死人復活
can do to bring back the dead.

1368
02:38:59,520 --> 02:39:02,250
我只能乞求上帝
All I can do now is pray to God...

1369
02:39:04,290 --> 02:39:06,990
不要讓這種悲劇重演
...that I can stop this from ever happening again.

1370
02:39:46,600 --> 02:39:48,030
誰知道呢
I don't know.

1371
02:39:48,100 --> 02:39:51,630
也許應該留著它像現在這個樣子
Maybe they just ought to leave it the way it is.

1372
02:39:51,700 --> 02:39:54,640
作為警示後人的恥辱柱
Kind of a shrine to all the bullshit in the world.

1373
02:40:04,520 --> 02:40:08,040
今晚我們很幸運 死了不到200人
You know, we were lucky tonight. Body count's less than 200.

1374
02:40:09,320 --> 02:40:12,310
總有一天
One of these days,

1375
02:40:12,390 --> 02:40:14,380
火將使成千上萬的人喪命
they'll kill 1 0,000 in one of these firetraps.

1376
02:40:14,460 --> 02:40:18,120
我還將在延續的火苗中往外抬屍…
And I'll keep eating smoke and bringing out bodies...

1377
02:40:18,200 --> 02:40:20,530
直到有人問我…
...until somebody asks us...

1378
02:40:21,770 --> 02:40:23,630
該怎樣蓋樓
...how to build them.

1379
02:40:35,110 --> 02:40:38,050
好吧，我問你
Okay. I'm asking.

1380
02:40:39,720 --> 02:40:41,690
你能找到我
You know where to reach me.

1381
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:45,010
再見，建築師
So long, architect.
