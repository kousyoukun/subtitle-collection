我不知道

46
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:36,025
- 你不知道是什么意思？　- 那个男人戴着帽子
- What do you mean, you don't know?  - He had a hat on.

47
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,112
把帽子都戴上

00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,409
现在呢？
Well?

你说过那个男人很高，他穿着棕色西服，戴着宽沿帽
He was tall, you say. He had on a brown suit and a wide-brim hat.

50
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,042
你不是正看着他吗？
All right, don't you see him?

51
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,632
快点！是不是这个男人？
Well, come on! Is that him?

52
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,302
不，不是这个男人
No, it isn't him.

53
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,439
- 好吧　- 就这样
- Okay.  - That's all.

54
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,278
- 迪崔克警长？　- 什么事？

局长让你立即去他办公室

56
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,756
坐下，警长
Sit down, Lieutenant.

57
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,551

七起人身侵犯，五起道德侵犯
seven assaults, five morals offenses

60
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,355
这仅仅是过去一个月内的案件
in the past 30 days.

61
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,858
即便是对第四警区来讲，这记录也太严重了
Quite a record, even for the Fourth Precinct, Lieutenant Ditrich.

62
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:01,152
局长，我们知道那个惯犯是谁
We know the guy who's been pulling most of the stickups, Commissioner.

63
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:05,031
他名叫迪克斯·汉德利，他今早被带来做疑犯辨认
Name's Dix Handley. He was in the show-up this morning,

64
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,451
但证人临阵退缩，没有指认他
but our witness got cold feet and backed down.

65
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,412
- 我们能怎么办？　- 把那个证人关起来！逼他说！
- What can you do?  - Lock up the witness! Scare him worse!

66
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,039
你应该知道如何做你的工作
It's your job knowing what to do.

67
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,958
在你的辖区内，唯一完好无损的店铺
As things are, the only merchants safe from harm in your precinct

68
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,086
是那些搞押注赌马的
are those who take wages on the horses.

69
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,672
我想知道那些场所怎么还在运转
I want to know why those parlors are still operating.

70
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,883
我关闭过它们，可它们又死灰复燃了
I close them down, but they only open up again.

71
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,136
你没有斩草除根！你得拔掉他们的电话线！砸烂家具！
You don't close 'em hard enough! Rip out the phones! Smash up the furniture!

72
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:29,765
长官，人们喜欢赌马，仅仅因为法律说不…
People like to bet the horses, sir, and just because the law says no --

73
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,893
轮不到你跟我谈法律
I don't want your opinion of the law.

74
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,987
- 长官，交代完了吗？　- 不，还没完
- Is that all, sir?  - No, that's not all.

75
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,365
厄文·瑞登施奈德在哪里？
Where is Erwin Riedenschneider?

76
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,452
- 我也在打听他，长官　- 你不知道他在哪里吗？
- I'm waiting to hear on that, sir.  - You don't know where he is, do you?

77
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,204
不知道，长官，但我们能从我们的线人那里得到消息
No, sir, but we ought to get word from our stoolies.

78
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,415
你得为此事全权负责
It was all dumped in your lap.

79
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,752
昨天中午十二点，他从州立监狱释放后乘火车来本市
He left state prison yesterday at 12 noon, took a train for this city.

80
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,628
到达时间是三点十七分
Time of arrival, 3:17.

81
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,756
你所要做的只是跟踪他，对他进行二十四小时监控
All you had to do was spot him, stay with him for 24 hours.

82
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,675
如果他没按规定登记，把他关起来
If he didn't register, lock him up.

83
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,970
可结果呢？他在火车站的五个街区外甩掉了你
But what happens? He loses you five blocks from the depot.

84
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,265
一个极其危险的罪犯正在本市逍遥法外
And one of the most dangerous criminals alive is now at large in this city.

85
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,143
跟踪他的两个警员应该为愚蠢失职获得「奖章」
The two men on that detail ought to get medals for dumbness.

86
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,646
是你派他们去的，你也应该获得「奖章」
They were assigned by you. You oughta get one too.

87
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,067
迪崔克，我能用三种方法惩罚你
Ditrich, I can do three things about you.

88
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,153
我能把你贬为巡警，送你到偏僻的街角
I can reduce you to patrolman and send you down to Five Corners,

89
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,448
我也能让内务部以玩忽职守的名义审判你
I can bring you up for departmental trial on charges of incompetence,

90
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,993
或者我还能再给你一次机会去履行你的职责
or I can give you one more chance to make good on your responsibilities.

91
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,871
我觉得最后一种方法是最好的惩罚
I think that'll be the greatest punishment of all.

92
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,332
谢谢，长官
Thank you, sir.

93
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,220
这就是你要找的门牌号
There's the number you're looking for.

94
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,931
但天已经黑了，你想让我等你吗？
But it's dark. You want me to wait?

95
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,605
我要是你就不会拎着提箱在这附近转悠
I wouldn't go parading around this neighborhood with a suitcase.

96
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,734
某些青年混混可能就为了一件干净衬衫打劫你
Some of these young punks might clip ya just to get a clean shirt.

97
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,251
- 什么事？　- 我找考比
- Yeah?  - I want to see Cobby.

98
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:25,380
- 你是谁？　- 就说博士来了，他想见考比
- Who are you?  - Just say Doc is here and would like to see him.

99
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,603
在这里等着，你最好有正当理由，哥们儿
Wait here. You'd better be on the legit, pal.

100
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,405
你有什么筹码？
What do you got?

101
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,365
三张三
Three threes.

102
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,752
他是何方鬼怪？
Well, where the devil is he?

103
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,632
有事快说，我很忙，你想做什么？
All right, make it fast. I'm a busy man. What do you want?

104
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:12,052
- 我今天刚出狱　- 噢，原来如此
- I just got out today.  - Oh, so that's it.

105
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:15,847
我厌倦了你们这种人找我要吃要喝，我又不是银行
I'm tired of you guys that fell putting the bite on me. I'm no First National Bank.

106
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,183
- 我有一份提议给你　- 你们这种人总有提议
- I got a proposition for you.  - All you guys have.

107
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,060
- 也许你还不知道我是谁　- 我从未见过你
- Maybe you didn't get who I was.  - I never seen you before.

108
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,730
- 快说，什么事？　- 也许你听说过我
- Come on, come on. What is it?  - Maybe you've heard of me.

109
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,483
听说过「教授」吗？也有人用德语叫我「博士先生」
The Professor? Or Herr Doktor, maybe.

110
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,570
你的意思是，你就是瑞登施奈德？
You mean, you are Riedenschneider?

111
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,740
你为什么不早说？
Well, why didn't you say so?

112
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,035
快进来，博士，快进来
Come on in, Doc. Come on in.

113
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,249
坐下，博士，坐下
Sit down, Doc. Sit down.

114
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,295
- 喝杯酒吗？　- 不必
- Have a drink?  - Nothing to drink.

115
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,966
我坐牢时把喝酒的喜好戒掉了
I got out of the habit behind the walls.

116
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:57,472
- 戒掉喝酒这喜好很容易　- 那我就为喝酒这喜好干一杯
- That's all it is -- a habit.  - Well, here's to the drink habit.

117
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,850
这是唯一不会给我带来麻烦的喜好
It's the only one I got that don't get me into trouble.

118
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,897
言归正传，博士，你有什么想法？
Well, Doc, what's on your mind?

119
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,483
我有一份提议，很大的提议
I got a proposition. A big one.

120
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,194
- 很大是多大？　- 这提议对你而言太大了，考比
- How big is big?  - Too big for you, Cobby.

121
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,864
博士，我不喜欢吹牛，但我也混得不错
Now, wait, Doc. I don't like to brag, but I'm doing all right.

122
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,575
我从事赌注登记，我有赢钱筹码
Makin' book. I'm in the chips.

123
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:22,205
- 到底是什么提议？　- 一起盗窃计划
- What kind of proposition is it?  - A plan for a caper.

124
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:26,292
绝好的生意，我可以在公开市场把货物卖十万美元
And it's a good one. I could sell it for $100,000 on the open market,

125
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,419
但那样做不值得，相当于把钱扔掉
but that would be throwing money away.

126
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,630
我更喜欢亲自处理货物…
I prefer to execute it myself and make --

127
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,591
- 能赚多少？　- 五十万美元
- How much?  - Half a million dollars.

128
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,802
也许更多
Maybe even more.

129
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,141
当然，我会事先做些准备工作，毕竟这计划搁置了好几年
Of course I will have to do a little checking, as the plan is some years old.

130
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,268
但准备工作要的钱不多，不多
But not much checking. Not much.

131
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,563
我需要大概五万块钱的经费
I need roughly 50,000 to operate.

132
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,569
五万块钱？
Fifty thousand?

133
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,196
不行，我看不行
No, no, no, I don't see.

134
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,408
当然，我想埃默瑞克先生也许能帮忙
Of course. I thought maybe Mr. Emmerich.

135
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,120
你还知道埃默瑞克先生？
What do you know about Mr. Emmerich?

136
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,164
我只是坐牢时有所耳闻
Only what I heard in the walls --

137
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:08,043
他有钱投资，而通过你可以找到他
that he has money to invest and that the way to get to him is through you.

138
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,462
除非我的情报不正确…
Of course, if my information is not correct...

139
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,172
当然正确，完全正确
Correct. Sure. Sure, it's correct.

140
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:17,218
我只是没想到埃默瑞克先生也会和此类交易扯上关联
It's just that I never thought of Mr. Emmerich in connection with this kind of a deal.

141
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,888
失陪一会儿，我马上回来
Excuse me a minute. I'll be right back.

142
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,774
喂？
Hello?

143
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,708
谢谢，稍后见
Thanks. See ya later.

144
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,295
你好，迪克斯，你想要什么？
Hello, Dix. What do you want?

145
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,214
- 我想来押注　- 噢？
- I wanna make a bet.  - Well?

146
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:57,217
- 你的人说得先经你同意　- 你要押注多少？
- Your man says you got to okay it.  - What are you in for?

147
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,427
大概两千三百块钱
2,300 and some.

148
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,180
好的，你可以赊账押注两千五百块钱
Okay. Your tab's good for 2,500.

149
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,809
但那是上限，你要么押个赢家赚钱，要么输光后还我钱
But that's the limit. Either pick a winner or pay me when you get that far.

150
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,560
不要挖苦我！
Don't bone me!

151
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,649
- 我没有挖苦…　- 我赖账过吗？
- Now, look, I'm not boning --  - Did I ever welsh?

152
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,609
- 没人说你赖账　- 你刚才挖苦我
- Nobody said you did.  - You just boned me.

153
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,444
- 迪克斯…　- 我不需要你的人情
- Look, Dix --  - I'm not asking you any favors.

154
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,864
我现在就去给你拿两千三百块钱
I'll go get you your 2,300 right now.

155
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:25,537
别走，迪克斯，你要喝杯酒吗？来吧
Now, Dix. Now, Dix, listen. Will you have a drink? Come on.

156
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,164
迪克斯，回来喝杯酒吧
Dix, come back here. Have a drink.

157
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,208
岂有此理！
Can you beat that?

158
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,336
- 他的脾气为什么总这样火爆？　- 他是谁？
- Where does he come off blowing a fuse?  - Who is he?

159
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,005
一个不入流的恶棍，赌马赌疯了
A small-time hooligan who's crazy for horses.

160
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,300
他一直来我这里押注赌马，却总是输
My book beats him and beats him, he keeps coming back for more.

161
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,136
瞧，博士
Say, Doc.

162
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,471
我都忘记那笔大买卖了
I forgot on account of that big tramp.

163
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,142
我在电话里跟埃默瑞克先生说了，他今晚稍后会见我们
I spoke to Mr. Emmerich on the phone. He's gonna meet us later on tonight.

164
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,145
他正在他市区的房子里为富翁们举办晚宴
He's giving a dinner party at his house in town for a bunch of swells,

165
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,773
但他稍后会在他另一处房子见我们
but he'll be at another address later on.

166
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:56,443
像埃默瑞克这种人总是有不止一处房子用来歇脚
A man like Emmerich has got more than one place to hang his hat.

167
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:07,662
聪明的猫咪，从不干活，晚上出门，白天睡觉
Smart cat. Never does a lick of work, stays out all night, sleeps all day.

168
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,665
把又肥又脏的猫带进餐馆来干嘛？
What's a big, dirty cat doing at an eating joint?

169
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,501
我每次开车碰到猫都会碾压过去
I run over one every time I get a chance.

170
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,796
有人喂猫，而有些孩子却吃不饱饭
People feeding cats, and some kids haven't got enough to eat.

171
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,589
你到底买不买那本杂志？
You gonna buy that magazine?

172
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:22,218
为什么要买？我只看美女插图，已经看完了
Why should I? I seen all the dames in it already.

173
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,845
你对此想怎样？
Wanna make something of it?

174
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,680
浑球，你是不是有点过分？
You're a little off your beat, ain't you, buster?

175
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,515
矮驼子，你什么意思？
How do you mean, Humpty Dumpty?

176
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,352
我的意思是你不属于这里，你只是路过的
I mean, you don't belong around here. You're just passing through.

177
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,479
赶紧滚吧
Only not fast enough.

178
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,816
如果我真看到你碾压猫咪，我会把你打得满地找牙
If I ever see you running over a cat, I'll kick your teeth out.

179
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:41,279
如果你再长高点，也不驼背，我早就把你撕碎了
I'd take you apart if you were about a foot taller and straightened up a little.

180
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,580
我猜你是想拿回你的武器
Suppose you want your heater back.

181
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,957
我不会给你的，你打算把我怎样？
Well, you ain't gonna get it. What do you think of that?

182
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,209
- 戈斯，别开玩笑　- 我认真的
- Quit kidding, Gus.  - I mean it.

183
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,338
发火呀，把我打倒去拿枪
Go on, get sore. Smack me down.

184
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,340
你知道我不会那么做的
You know I wouldn't do that.

185
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,760
迪克斯，听我的建议，先休息一段时间
Look, Dix, take my advice and knock off for a while.

186
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:07,722
那些警察小子在疯狂抓人，总部把他们逼得很紧
The happiness boys are on a rampage. Headquarters has given them the push.

187
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,267
- 我负担不起休息　- 别担心，我会借钱给你
- I can't afford to knock off.  - Oh, stop worrying. I'll stake you.

188
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,229
- 是吗？可我需要两千三百块钱　- 什么？
- Yeah? I need 2,300.  - What?

189
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,898
- 我有事要急用　- 找过考比吗？
- Something I just gotta take care of.  - Cobby, maybe?

190
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:22,445
让考比为此出汗吧，这对他有好处，他能拿出一些钱
Well, let him sweat. It'll do him good. Cobby can spare a few pounds.

191
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,572
你不能给他那种人欠钱
You can't owe money to a guy like him,

192
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,992
那个满嘴铜臭味的小人只会挖苦你
a little loudmouth who bones you when he isn't even trying to.

193
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,660
迪克斯，我没听懂
I don't get you, Dix.

194
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,622
我不想再给考比欠债，我想留点自尊
I just can't be in Cobby's debt and keep my self-respect.

195
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,457
噢
Oh.

196
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,167
好吧
All right.

197
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,628
我手头上有一千块钱，你可以借去用
I got a grand put away. You can have that.

198
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:41,047
我再想办法弄另外一千三百块钱
Maybe I can dig up 1,300 more.

199
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,675
- 我猜你欠我的钱就没问题，是吧？　- 我猜是的
- I guess it's all right to owe me, huh?  - I guess.

200
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,802
那我可真荣幸
Yeah. It's just my luck.

201
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,430
我尽量明天弄到钱
Well, I'll get it tomorrow or bust a gut.

202
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,684
与此同时，你别在街道上转悠，尤其是晚上
In the meantime, stay away from the boulevard, especially at night.

203
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,436
另外，警察抄封了那家高档会所，雷格尔俱乐部
By the way, they knocked over that clip joint, the Club Regal.

204
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,647
- 朵儿不是在那里工作吗？　- 是的
- Wasn't that where Doll worked?  - Yeah.

205
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,233
- 好像来了大批警察　- 是的
- It's coming in bunches, it looks like.  - Yeah.

206
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,652
迪克斯，回家老实待着
Go home, Dix. Stay home.

207
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,031
好吧
Yeah.

208
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:10,785
别垂头丧气的，记住，你仍有老戈斯当后盾
Don't get your flag at half-mast. Remember, you still got old Gus.

209
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,136
一千三百块钱？你疯了吧
Thirteen hundred? You must be crazy.

210
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,347
为了迪克斯？我干嘛关心那个恶棍？
For Dix? What do I care for that hooligan?

211
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,934
戈斯，我也想帮你
I'd like to help you out, Gus,

212
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:38,813
但我要养家糊口，还得交房租之类的
but I got mouths to feed and rent to pay and all that stuff.

213
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,902
<i>你这肥大的意大利佬…道友，你怎么不机灵点？</i>
<i>You great big, fat Italian -- Why don't you wise up, you wise guy?</i>

214
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,863
- 你是个人渣　- 安静！
- You're a low-down scum.  - Shh!

215
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,907
你这人渣竟敢这么跟我说话
A low-down, dirty scum to talk to me like that.

216
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,027
戈斯，听着
Look, Gus.

217
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,779
我猜我可以帮忙
I guess I can make it, all right.

218
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,706
- 谁啊？　<i>- 迪克斯，是我，朵儿</i>
- Yeah?  <i>- Dix, it's me, Doll.</i>

219
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,333
朵儿？
Doll?

220
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,805
嗨，亲爱的
Hi, honey.

221
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,141
进来吧
Come on in.

222
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,399
- 关上门　- 当然，迪克斯
- Close the door.  - Well, sure, Dix. Sure.

223
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:12,907
亲爱的，我很抱歉打搅你，但是…
I'm awful sorry to bother you, honey, but...

224
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,010
朵儿，如果妳想抽烟，记得带火柴
Doll, if you're gonna smoke, you gotta learn to carry matches.

225
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,689
朵儿，妳哭什么？
Doll, what are you crying about?

226
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,859
没什么，迪克斯，没什么
N-Nothin', Dix. Nothing.

227
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,694
对不起
I'm sorry.

228
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:53,156
迪克斯，对不起
I'm sorry, Dix.

229
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:57,869
这么晚还来打搅你，我也不知道我在想什么
I don't know what I was thinking about, bothering you at this time of the night.

230
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,787
我这就走
I'll just run along.

231
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,124
戈斯跟我说雷格尔俱乐部被抄封了
Gus told me the Club Regal got knocked over.

232
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,751
是的，雷格尔竟然被抄封，你能想象吗？
Yeah. Can you imagine, raiding the Regal?

233
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,170
那些警察一定是疯了
The cops must have all gone crazy.

234
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,340
即便是高档会所又怎样？
So it's a clip joint. So what?

235
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,343
而且警察正好在发薪日来抄封
And it would have to happen on pay night.

236
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,805
- 想喝杯酒吗？　- 我不介意来一杯
- How about a drink?  - Hey, I don't care if I do.

237
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,475
我的一个假睫毛掉了
One of my eyelashes is coming off.

238
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,856
妳被房东赶出门了吗？
Were you, uh, locked out of your room?

239
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,233
你怎么猜到的？
How'd you guess?

240
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,652
呃…为倒霉日干杯
Well... here's how.

241
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:40,828
迪克斯，如果不太麻烦的话，我能在你这里待几天吗？
Uh, Dix, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, could I stay here a couple of days?

242
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,959
就一、两天
Just a day or two.

243
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:53,257
好吧，朵儿，妳可以待在这里，但妳不要有别的想法
All right. Stay if you want to. But don't you go getting any ideas, Doll.

244
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,059
一切都已计划周密，从轮流值班看守
Everything is here, from the observed routine of the personnel

245
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,686
到警报系统，门锁的型号
to the alarm system, the type of locks on doors,

246
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:09,190
还有主保险柜的使用年数及其它信息
the age and condition of the main safe and so forth and so forth.

247
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:13,110
埃默瑞克先生，相信我，现在是「万事俱备，只欠东风」
Take my word for it, Mr. Emmerich. This is a ripe plum ready to fall.

248
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,030
朋友，所有江湖人士都说是「小事一桩」
My friend, according to the boys, all takes are easy.

249
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,242
但作为律师，我却以帮助他们洗脱罪名赚大钱
But as a lawyer, I've made a lot of money getting them out of jail.

250
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,702
埃默瑞克先生，也许你知道我的名声
Please, Mr. Emmerich. Perhaps you know my reputation.

251
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,746
我策划过不少大买卖
I've engineered some very big things.

252
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,416
埃默瑞克先生，确实如此，博士是顶尖高手
That's a fact, Mr. Emmerich. Doc here is tops.

253
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:30,336
据我所知，你本来是为了上次行动而搜集的这些信息？
Am I to understand you gathered this information before doing your last stretch?

254
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:33,047
没错，我原本已经准备动手
That is correct. I was ready to begin operations,

255
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,300
然后因为一宗我几乎忘记的陈年盗窃案，臭警察把我抓了
and the coppers grabbed me for an old caper I'd almost forgotten about.

256
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,344
阿德菲亚金融公司盗窃案
The Adelphia Finance caper.

257
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,513
博士从中赚了十六万美元，对吗？
You took 'em for 160,000, didn't you, Doc?

258
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,181
十五万八千美元
A hundred and fifty-eight.

259
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,642
你真觉得这笔买卖可以按百万美元计算吗？
And you really believe there's a million in this thing?

260
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,185
也许更多
Maybe even more.

261
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,648
你的意思是干这一票就可以赚五十万美元现金吗？
You mean by that that the take will be worth half a million to us in actual cash?

262
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,691
但你我都知道
Because you know as well as I do

263
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:55,611
销赃者最多只会给五成价
that in no case will a fence give you more than 50 percent.

264
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,071
没错
That's right, sir.

265
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,116
- 那你的主要问题是什么？　- 有三项难题
- Well, what are your main problems?  - There are three.

266
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,410
行动经费，帮手
Money to operate, personnel,

267
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,537
最后是，货物如何出手
and finally, the disposing of the take.

268
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,414
埃默瑞克先生，第一项没问题，对吧？
No trouble about the first, eh, Mr. Emmerich?

269
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,499
且慢，考比，情况还有待观察
Wait a minute, Cobby. This remains to be seen.

270
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,710
帮手们只会领取固定报酬
The helpers will be paid off like house painters.

271
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,254
我不会告诉他们这笔买卖有多大
They'll be told nothing about the size of the take.

272
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,465
人有时会变得太贪婪
Sometimes men get greedy.

273
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,927
- 那你需要多少帮手？　- 只需三个
- Well, how many helpers do you need?  - Only three.

274
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,470
一个开锁专家
A box man.

275
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:25,348
付给他的报酬最多，大概两万五千美元
Him, we pay most. Maybe $25,000.

276
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:29,270
我想到个人，路易·查维利，芝加哥西区最好的开锁匠
I got a guy for you. Louis Ciavelli. Best box man west of Chicago.

277
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,064
机械锁专家，曾干过一些大型盗窃案
Expert mechanic. Been in some very big capers.

278
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:35,901
我听说他开保险柜跟拆表一样轻松，但他要价很高
From what I hear, he can open a safe like the back of a watch. Only, he costs.

279
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,488
然后我们需要一个顶级车手，以防逃跑时用到他
Then we need a top-notch driver, in case of a rumble.

280
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,991
- 车手只用付一万块钱　- 嗯哼
- He should get 10,000.  - Mm-hmm.

281
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:45,077
最后，不得不说，我们需要一个恶棍
Finally, sad to say, we need a hooligan.

282
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,163
这种人大多数有毒瘾，他们毫无优点
Most of these fellas are drug addicts. They're a no-good lot.

283
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:52,042
他们只知道使用暴力，但遗憾的是此类行动需要恶棍
Violence is all they know, but they are, unfortunately, necessary.

284
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:55,963
如果这恶棍可靠的话，我会付给他一万五千块钱
For a more or less reliable man, I'd say 15,000.

285
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,298
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

286
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:00,175
那总共是五万块钱
Well, that's 50,000 in all.

287
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,928
如何…
How, uh --

288
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,014
如何把赃物卖出去？
How's this take to be handled?

289
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,767
联系中西部最好的销赃者们
We'll get in touch with the best fences in the Midwest

290
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:10,186
把赃物卖给出价最高的人
and deal with whoever makes the highest offer.

291
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,563
也许一个销赃者没那么多钱
Maybe no one fence can handle the whole thing.

292
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:16,233
那样的话，我们卖给两、三个销赃者
In that case, we deal with two or three.

293
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,611
五十万美元，是吧？
Half a million, eh?

294
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,405
我…
I, uh...

295
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,075
我…我在想
I'm, uh... I'm just thinking.

296
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:30,247
如果我决定参与，我…
If I decide to go into this thing, I, uh...

297
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,750
我自己可以买下这些…
I, myself, I might handle the...

298
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,503
埃默瑞克先生，你做销赃者？
You, a fence, Mr. Emmerich?

299
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,964
不，考比，不完全是
Oh, no, no, Cobby. Not exactly.

300
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:42,760
但这笔生意听起来很棒，我想卖它个最高价
But your proposition looks pretty good. I'd like to see the most made of it.

301
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,971
我猜人应该只做自己擅长的事
Oh, I suppose a fella should stick to his own trade,

302
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:49,057
但我也认识本地的一些大人物
but, uh, I know some pretty big men around here

303
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:52,686
如果沟通得当，他们也许会接受这样的交易
that might not be averse to a deal like this, if they're properly approached.

304
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,774
我补充一句，他们是非常受敬仰的大人物
Highly respectable men, I might add.

305
00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:00,778
所以在你寻找销赃者之前，我先帮你问问情况，如何？
So why don't you let me see what I can do before you look for a fence, hmm?

306
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:05,533
就几天时间，我猜对你来说也没什么损失
A few days, more or less, wouldn't make much difference to you, I don't suppose.

307
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,453
- 如果成功，大家一起多赚钱　- 好的
- Might mean a lot more money for all of us.  - Good.

308
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,705
还有一件事，我不愿提起
There's just one thing. I dislike to mention it,

309
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,208
- 但我刚从监狱出来…　- 噢，当然
- but I've just come from prison and...  - Oh. Well, of course.

310
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,337
考比会给你安排住处，以及你需要的一切
Cobby will advance you anything you need, see that you have a place to stay.

311
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,339
- 考比，对吗？　- 那是当然
- Eh, Cobby?  - Well, you bet your life.

312
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,217
而且我还有一些特殊服务电话，博士
And I got some fancy phone numbers for you too, Doc.

313
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:32,393
像你这种有品味的人坐牢七年是什么滋味？
What's it like, a man of your taste, seven years behind the walls?

314
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:35,855
不算太糟，监狱可以磨炼性情
Not too bad. It's a matter of temperament.

315
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,191
我在里面不找麻烦，狱警喜欢犯人这样
I cause no trouble. The prison authorities appreciate that.

316
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,902
然后他们就让我做图书管理员
They made me assistant librarian.

317
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,780
恐怕我可当不了这种模范犯人
I'm afraid I wouldn't make a model prisoner.

318
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:49,201
干完这一票，我就到墨西哥，去过国王般的日子
After this job, it's Mexico for me. I'll live like a king.

319
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,078
墨西哥女孩非常漂亮
Mexican girls are very pretty.

320
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:54,456
我每天什么也不做，就在阳光下追求她们
I'll have nothing to do all day long but chase them in the sunshine.

321
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,587
- 你非常大方，先生　- 晚安
- You've been very kind, sir.  - Good night. Good night.

322
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,215
- 再见，埃默瑞克先生　- 再见，考比
- Mr. Emmerich.  - Cobby.

323
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:32,161
朗大叔，你站在那里盯着我干嘛？
What's the big idea, standing there staring at me, Uncle Lon?

324
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:33,871
别叫我「朗大叔」
Don't call me "Uncle Lon."

325
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:36,332
我还以为你喜欢呢
I thought you liked it.

326
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:38,709
也许我曾经喜欢
Maybe I did.

327
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,836
但现在不了
I don't anymore.

328
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,180
我让卖场给你送些咸水鲭鱼
I had the market send over some salt mackerel for you.

329
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,307
我知道你喜欢把它当早餐
I know how you love it for breakfast.

330
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,518
甜美的女孩
Some sweet kid.

331
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,899
很晚了
It's late.

332
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,026
妳为什么不去睡觉呢？
Why don't you go to bed?

333
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:29,385
甜美的女孩
Some sweet kid.

334
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:56,495
喂，是鲍勃·布兰姆吗？我是埃默瑞克
Hello, Bob Brannom? This is Emmerich.

335
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,499
不，我不是打电话聊天的
No, no. I didn't call you to get the right time.

336
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,877
听着，我有份工作交给你
Listen, I've got a job for you.

337
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,920
不，不是那种事
No, no. Nothing like that.

338
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:07,840
我有十万美元欠债没到帐
I've got over $100,000 standing out on my books.

339
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:11,510
明早到我办公室，我把欠债者的名单给你
Come to my office tomorrow morning, I'll give you a list of people that owe me.

340
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,512
不，不
No, no, no, no.

341
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,806
一个一个的想办法
Use the method called for in each particular case.

342
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,809
别跟我说任何过程，我只要结果
And don't tell me anything about it. All I want is results.

343
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,770
那又怎样？
So what?

344
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,606
放松，孩子，放松
Easy, boy. Easy.

345
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,194
喂
Hello.

346
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,779
你是谁？
Who?

347
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,489
噢，是戈斯呀
Oh, sure, Gus.

348
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,200
他还没睡醒
He's still asleep.

349
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,826
什么？
What?

350
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,372
好的，我会转告他
Yeah. Yeah, I'll tell him.

351
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,337
亲爱的，戈斯打来电话
Honey. Honey, that was Gus.

352
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,299
他说你随时可以去找他，他有东西给你
He says you can come over anytime. He's got something for you.

353
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:51,675
好的
Okay.

354
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,928
亲爱的，喝咖啡吗？我刚弄的
Coffee, honey? I made it fresh.

355
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,512
好的
Yeah. Yeah.

356
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,639
嘿，你肯定做梦了
Hey, you sure were dreaming.

357
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:02,519
- 妳怎么知道？　- 你睡着时还说话
- How do you know?  - You were talking in your sleep.

358
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:05,230
- 我说什么了？　- 都是些零散的话
- What was I saying?  - It was all jumbled up.

359
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:09,026
但有一个词语我听得很清楚，你说了好几次
But I heard one word real plain. You called it out several times.

360
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,111
「玉米饼干」
"Corn cracker."

361
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,072
那是什么意思？
What's that mean?

362
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,449
玉米饼干？
Corn Cracker?

363
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,576
玉米饼干是一匹雄马驹
Corn Cracker was a colt.

364
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,328
是这样啊
Yeah, it would be.

365
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,957
它是一匹高大的黑色雄马驹
Yeah. He was a tall, black colt.

366
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,917
我想起我做的梦了
Yeah, I remember what I was dreaming.

367
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,252
我骑在那匹雄马驹背上
I was up on that colt's back.

368
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:30,255
我父亲和我爷爷在旁边看着我取乐
My father and my grandfather were there, watching the fun.

369
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,216
那匹雄马驹正在跳跃、蹬蹄
That colt was buck-jumping and pitching.

370
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,844
它试图把我甩脱在篱笆上，但我还是骑着它
Once he tried to scrape me off against the fence, but I stayed with him, you bet.

371
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,929
然后我听到我爷爷说：
Then I heard my granddaddy say,

372
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:40,182
「他是汉德利家的棒小伙，正宗男子汉」
"He's a real Handley, that boy. A real Handley."

373
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,059
我当时骄傲极了
And I felt proud as you please.

374
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,937
迪克斯，那是真事吗？在你小时候？
Did that really happen, Dix, when you were a kid?

375
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:48,357
不完全是，那匹黑色雄马驹首次跳跃就把我甩脱在篱笆上
Not exactly. The black colt pitched me into a fence on the first buck.

376
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:51,235
然后我老爸走过来，用他的靴子踢着我说：
My old man come over, prodded me with his boot and said,

377
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,572
「也许这能教会你不要吹嘘自己擅长骑马」
"Maybe that'll teach you not to brag about how good you are on a horse."

378
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,200
很高兴看到你笑了
It's nice to hear you laugh.

379
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:00,744
妳知道吗？
You know something?

380
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:04,581
是我的祖辈首先把爱尔兰良种马引进县里的
One of my ancestors imported the first Irish thoroughbred into our county.

381
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,626
- 真的吗？　- 当然
- Is that a fact?  - Sure.

382
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,713
我们家的农场世代相传
Why, our farm was in the family for generations.

383
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:13,007
总共一百六十英亩的农场
One hundred sixty acres.

384
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,884
有三十英亩的广阔草地，其余的种庄稼
Thirty in bluegrass and the rest in crops.

385
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:19,304
漂亮谷仓，七匹母马
Fine barn and seven brood mares.

386
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:22,307
- 迪克斯，听起来真好　- 本来是的
- Sounds wonderful, Dix.  - It was.

387
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,476
然后一切发生得太突然
And then everything happened at once.

388
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,813
我老爸死了，我们的玉米田没了
My old man died, and we lost our corn crop.

389
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:32,276
那匹黑色雄马驹摔断了腿，我们只能射死它
That black colt I was telling you about, he broke his leg and had to be shot.

390
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:35,237
那是苦涩的一年
That was a rotten year.

391
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,364
我永远忘不了我们离开的那天
I'll never forget the day we left.

392
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:41,285
我和我弟弟发誓，总有一天我们要把山核桃木农场买回来
Me and my brother swore we'd buy Hickorywood Farm back someday.

393
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:45,497
被迫离开从小长大的地方一定很糟糕
Growing up in a place and then having to leave must be awful.

394
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,416
我从未有过一个像样的家
I never had a proper home.

395
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:50,878
一万两千块钱就能买回来，有一次我几乎做到了
Twelve grand would have swung it, and I almost made it once.

396
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,756
我手里有超过五千美元
I had more than $5,000 in my pocket

397
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:56,550
潘彭这匹马要参加比赛
and Pampoon was running in the Suburban.

398
00:27:56,675 --> 00:28:00,262
我觉得这匹马不会输，我把所有钱都押给它
I figured he couldn't lose. I put it all on his nose.

399
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,639
它却输了
He lost by a nose.

400
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,809
亲爱的，喝咖啡吧，免得凉了
Drink your coffee, honey, before it gets cold.

401
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,313
我觉得我就要时来运转了
The way I figure, my luck's just gotta turn.

402
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:12,733
再过几天，我要干件大事，然后我就回老家
One of these days, I'll make a real killing. Then I'm gonna head for home.

403
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:17,654
回老家后我首先去溪流中洗澡，把这座城市的污垢都洗掉
First thing when I get there, I take a bath in the creek and get this city dirt off me.

404
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:26,580
- 怎么了？　- 没事，迪克斯，没事
- What's the matter?  - Nothing, Dix. Nothing. Nothing.

405
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,707
- 我说错什么了吗？　- 没有
- I say something wrong?  - No.

406
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:33,337
这地方一团糟，它需要好好清扫
But, gee, this place is a mess. It needs a good cleaning.

407
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,840
你怎么受得了如此生活？
How can you stand to live like this?

408
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,433
数数
Count it.

409
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,187
数数
Count it.

410
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,439
迪克斯，你不用一次性把赌注付清
Look, Dix. You don't have to pay the whole tab at once.

411
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,525
全数数看
Go ahead and count it.

412
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,152
干嘛生气？没必要生气
Why get sore? There's no reason to get sore.

413
00:28:57,277 --> 00:29:00,114
你在陌生人面前挖苦我，试图贬低我
You boned me in front of a stranger, trying to make me look small.

414
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:03,117
我不是故意的，我这张嘴总说胡话，也许我喝醉了
I didn't mean it. I shoot my mouth off. Maybe I had a slight load on.

415
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:06,078
- 你知道怎么回事　- 不，我不这么认为
- You know how it is.  - No. No, I don't know how it is.

416
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,413
迪克斯
Look, Dix.

417
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:11,708
我犯了个错误，难道你从不犯错吗？
I made a mistake. Don't you ever make a mistake?

418
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,586
是吧
Sure. Sure.

419
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,547
来，喝杯酒
Here, have a drink.

420
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,090
来吧
Here you are.

421
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,718
迪克斯，给你
There you are, Dix.

422
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,095
迪克斯，赌马要放聪明点
You know, Dix, you gotta play the horses the smart way.

423
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,015
省着用钱，下次有内部消息我会告诉你
Save your money. The next time there's a fix going, I'll let you know.

424
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,643
稳赚不赔，稳赚不赔
It'll be money from home. Money from home.

425
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,106
失陪一下
Excuse me.

426
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,902
噢，是博士啊，快进来
Oh, it's the Doc. Come on in, Doc.

427
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:39,987
来见见我的朋友，迪克斯·汉德利
Want you to meet a friend of mine. Dix Handley.

428
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,738
这位是瑞登施奈德博士
This is Doc Riedenschneider.

429
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,532
- 你听说过他，对吧？　- 是的
- You heard of him, I guess, huh?  - Yeah.

430
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:47,452
你觉得威士忌如何？从你家乡产的
Well, how'd you like the whiskey? Made in your home state.

431
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,788
噢，你家乡在哪里？
Oh. Where is that, sir?

432
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,166
肯塔基州，布恩县
Kentucky. Boone County, Kentucky.

433
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,960
- 有美国最好的淡水　- 是吗？
- Best water in the USA.  - Is that so?

434
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:57,754
是的，那里的水让威士忌更可口
Yeah, it's the water makes the whiskey fit to drink.

435
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,506
好了…
Well...

436
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:02,968
我得走了，有机会再见
I gotta be going. I'll see you around sometime maybe.

437
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:05,137
再见，迪克斯
So long, Dix.

438
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:10,184
乡巴佬
Big hick.

439
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:13,103
他的钱很好赚，但他的脾气太敏感
The color of his money's all right, but I wish he wasn't so touchy.

440
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,772
也许这就是他令人尊敬的品质，会对赌债负责
Maybe it's a point of honor with him. A gambling debt.

441
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:19,067
他那恶棍令人尊敬？别让我笑掉大牙
Him? That hooligan? Honor? Don't make me laugh.

442
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,486
- 你说他是个恶棍？　- 对，但是不入流
- He's a hooligan, you say?  - Yeah, but a small-timer.

443
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:25,449
他只是抢劫香烟店、加油站，然后把所有钱拿去赌马
He'll stick up cigar stores, gas stations. And every cent goes to the ponies.

444
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,951
无论如何，我们都有自己的恶习
One way or another, we all work for our vice.

445
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,414
博士，你也有恶习吧？你昨晚的约会如何？
What do you say, Doc? How was your date last night?

446
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,083
那个年轻女士喝得大醉，算不上好伴侣
The young lady drank too much to be good company.

447
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:38,754
但夜晚并未完全浪费，她说的话比她清醒时更多
But the evening wasn't a complete loss. She talked more than if she'd been sober.

448
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:41,715
- 她说了什么？　- 你的朋友埃默瑞克先生
- Yeah? What about?  - Your friend Mr. Emmerich.

449
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,510
埃默瑞克？听着，博士
Emmerich? Now, look here, Doc.

450
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:47,763
这是笔五十万美元的大买卖，我得了解一切情况
There's half a million at stake. I've got to know where I stand.

451
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:50,390
埃默瑞克出资我才能雇佣帮手
Emmerich must put up before I can hire a crew.

452
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,309
对他而言，这是小菜一碟
For him, it's nothing. A dead cinch.

453
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:55,145
可昨晚的女士给我的信息是埃默瑞克破产了
The information she gave me is that he's broke.

454
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,566
你疯了吗？
Are you crazy?

455
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:03,237
我跟埃默瑞克先生打交道二十年了，他只接手大案子
I've seen Mr. Emmerich operate for 20 years. He handles only the biggest cases.

456
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,948
他有两栋房子，四辆车，半打佣人
He's got two houses, four cars, a half a dozen servants.

457
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:07,908
- 还包养了一个金发美女　- 博士！
- And one blond.  - Doc!

458
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:11,453
你相信谁的话？我的还是那个愚蠢小妞的？
Whose word you gonna take? Mine or some dim-witted dame?

459
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,996
当然相信你的
Yours, naturally.

460
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:16,124
如果他破产了，那我也想要像他那样破产
If he's broke, I wanna be broke the same way.

461
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,468
警长！警长！
Lieutenant! Lieutenant!

462
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,265
你在我办公室看见的那个人，他只是路过
That guy you saw in my office, he's just passing through.

463
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,727
闭嘴，我没看见任何人，我怎么可能？我没来过这里
Shut up. I didn't see anybody. How could I? I wasn't here.

464
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,647
对，是…是这样的
Yeah, that -- that's right. That's right.

465
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,566
- 听着…　- 什么事？
- Look, uh...  - Yeah?

466
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:45,070
我只是来通知你，你这里会有一次突击搜捕
I just came to tell you that, uh, you'll have to stand still for a raid.

467
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:47,406
你的意思是要拉我去警局里审讯？
You mean you have to haul me downtown and book me?

468
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:50,117
- 去警局的路程很短　- 我以为你是我的朋友！
- It's a short ride.  - I thought you were a friend of mine!

469
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,535
现在我迪崔克唯一的朋友是我自己
Right now I've got one friend -- Ditrich.

470
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,580
如果我迪崔克不做些抓捕行动，我就自身难保
And Ditrich's going to be out on his ear if he don't make a showing.

471
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:59,167
- 但为什么是我？为什么抓我？　- 因为这才符合常理
- All right, but why me? Why pick on me?  - Because it's logic.

472
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,294
你的赌注登记场所是我辖区内最大的
You're the biggest parlor in my precinct.

473
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,798
市民们知道，报社们知道，连我也知道
The citizens know it, the newspapers know it, and even I know it.

474
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,050
警察局长也知道我知道
And that Mr. Commissioner knows I know it.

475
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,720
我只是讨厌所发生的事
I just hate to have it happen. I just hate it, that's all.

476
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:12,764
- 我也很抱歉　- 警长，听着
- I'm as sorry as you are.  - Look, Lieutenant.

477
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,309
我已经跟你合作这么久了
I've always given you plenty of cooperation.

478
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:18,520
但现在抓我真的不是时候
But you're hitting me at just the wrong time.

479
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,065
那好吧
Well, all right.

480
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,817
关紧门
Close up tight.

481
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,069
不要开灯，不要接任何电话
Keep the place dark. Don't answer any phones.

482
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,863
多谢了，警长
Thanks, Lieutenant.

483
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:29,615
多谢了
Thanks.

484
00:32:37,415 --> 00:32:39,166
那个臭警察认出我了
That copper, he recognized me.

485
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,918
- 你怎么知道他是臭警察？　- 我离一街区就能闻出来
- How'd you know he was a copper?  - I can smell one a block off.

486
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:45,046
别担心迪崔克，他收了我的黑钱，算是合伙人
Don't worry about Ditrich. He's on my payroll. Practically a partner.

487
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,881
我和他是一根绳上的蚂蚱
Me and him, we're like that.

488
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:49,259
经验教导我永远别相信警察
Experience has taught me never to trust a policeman.

489
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,387
当你觉得他靠得住时，他就会背后捅刀
Just when you think one's all right, he turns legit.

490
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:59,102
- 布兰姆先生来了　- 对，让他进来
- A Mr. Brannom is here.  - Oh, yes, show him in.

491
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,522
先生，还有件事，埃默瑞克夫人身体不舒服
Pardon me, sir. Mrs. Emmerich is not feeling well.

492
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:06,067
知道了，通知豪斯曼医生来
Yes, well, send for Dr. Houseman.

493
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,737
- 我已经通知了，先生　- 很好
- I already have, sir.  - Good.

494
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:10,655
告诉我太太…
Tell her I, uh...

495
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,200
说我稍后上楼见她
Say I'll be up to see her later.

496
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:23,835
我的欠债者们如何？有多少人还钱？
Well, what about my debtors? How many of them came through?

497
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,130
- 没有一个　- 什么？
- Not a one.  - What's that?

498
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:30,301
你想知道所有的借口吗？有些借口很精彩
You want all the excuses? I've got some beauts.

499
00:33:30,426 --> 00:33:31,927
情况那么糟糕？
As bad as that, eh?

500
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:34,387
有两、三个人会还一部分钱，他们保证了
Two or three may come through with a part. They promised.

501
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,932
我不要保证，我只要现钱
I don't want promises. I want cash.

502
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:41,019
朋友，听着，私家侦探不能威胁人
Look, my friend, a private detective can't go around threatening people.

503
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,687
否则我会失去执照
I'd lose my license.

504
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,898
九成八的人你只能起诉他们
Ninety-eight percent of them you're gonna have to sue.

505
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,150
没有时间了，我…
There's no time for that. I...

506
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,653
我需要钱，我现在就需要钱
I gotta have money. I gotta have it this minute.

507
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:52,656
怎么回事？因为你那个金发女孩？
What is it? Girl trouble?

508
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:55,659
布兰姆，闭嘴！这不好笑
Shut up, Brannom! That's not funny.

509
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:58,912
什么？没人敢叫我闭嘴
How's that? Nobody tells me to shut up.

510
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,377
鲍勃，对不起
I'm sorry, Bob.

511
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,428
鲍勃，我…
Bob, I...

512
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,473
我破产了
I'm broke.

513
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,767
这是个简单明了的事实
There. Th-That's the plain, simple fact.

514
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,311
我完蛋了，我倒闭了
I'm finished. I'm bankrupt.

515
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:26,106
你怎么会让安吉拉这种女人把你整到破产？
How could you let a dame like Angela take you this way?

516
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:30,193
不是安吉拉的错，是这一切，是我的奢侈生活造成的
It's not Angela. It's everything. It's my whole way of life.

517
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,571
我每次开销都要花费数千美元
Every time I turn around, it costs thousands of dollars --

518
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:34,698
这里花一万美元，那里花一万美元
10,000 here, 10,000 there.

519
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:38,743
我必须…我必须脱身
I got... I gotta get out.

520
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,996
我必须彻底脱身
I gotta get out from under.

521
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:48,003
讽刺的是我现在有个机遇，但我却抓不住
And the irony of it is that I've got an opportunity and I can't take it.

522
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:49,879
很艰难
Tough.

523
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,465
鲍勃
Bob.

524
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:58,263
我会让你大吃一惊
I'm gonna hand you the shock of a lifetime.

525
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,603
你听说过瑞登施奈德博士吗？
Did you ever hear of Doc Riedenschneider?

526
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:06,730
当然，他不是在坐牢吗？
Sure. Behind the walls, isn't he?

527
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:10,275
不，他上周出狱了，考比带他来找我
No, he's out. He got out last week. Cobby brought him to me.

528
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,236
他有个计划，设计得非常完美
He's got a plan, beautifully worked out,

529
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,364
会是中西部有史以来最大的盗窃案
for the biggest caper ever to be pulled in the Middle West.

530
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:19,492
但他需要五万美元的经费
Only he wants $50,000 backing.

531
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,329
目标是谁？
Who would be taken?

532
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:25,415
贝拉提尔珠宝店
Belletier's.

533
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,544
保守地说，仅宝石就价值五十万美元
The rocks alone would be worth, conservatively speaking, half a million.

534
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,672
- 你能拿多少？　- 三分之一
- How much would you get out of it?  - A third of the take.

535
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,633
老兄，你真吓我一跳
Brother. You're knocking me out.

536
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:40,555
那如果我跟你说，我有个计划可以让我独吞一切呢？
What if I were to tell you that I've got a plan worked out to get it all?

537
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:46,019
我告诉他们让我来做销赃者，懂吗？
I could tell them that I'd fence the stuff myself, you see?

538
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,480
答应他们货物一到就付现金
Promise them cash on delivery.

539
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,858
然后…
Then...

540
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,986
等到交货时，我就说现金还没筹到，你明白吗？
when the time comes, I simply wouldn't have the cash. You understand?

541
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:58,114
我告诉他们筹钱还得几天
I'd tell them it'd take a few days more to raise it.

542
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,745
我确定能让他们在等钱时把货物放在我这里
I'm certain I could get them to leave the stuff with me while we're waiting.

543
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,247
- 继续说　- 然后我就消失
- Go on.  - Well, then I'd disappear.

544
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:09,042
坐飞机去别的国家，开始新生活
I'd take a plane to another country, to another life.

545
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:13,630
我可以把黄金和铂金融化成金条卖
The gold and platinum I could melt up and sell as bullion, you see.

546
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:16,675
至于宝石，一次卖一个
And the rocks, sell them one at a time.

547
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,220
不用着急，宝石是不会贬值的
There'd be no hurry. They'd last a lifetime.

548
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,640
我怎么会如此愚蠢？
How wrong can a guy be?

549
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,684
我还一直为你担心呢
Here I was worrying about your nerves,

550
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:28,269
而你却一直在思考如何背叛同伙
and you were dreaming up a double-cross like this.

551
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,231
是的
Yes.

552
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:35,360
但我做不成，因为我没有五万美元
But I can't do it because I haven't got $50,000.

553
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:38,196
- 我可以告诉你如何筹钱　- 你？
- I can tell you how to raise it.  - You?

554
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,615
如何筹钱？
How?

555
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,118
- 我能得到什么好处？　- 五五分账
- What's in it for me?  - Fifty-fifty.

556
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,288
好
Okay.

557
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:48,707
但我们有可能被杀死，朋友
But we may get ourselves killed, my friend.

558
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,545
是的，我…我知道
Yes, I -- I know.

559
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,048
- 到底如何筹钱？　- 很简单，通过考比
- Well, how do we raise the money?  - Simple. Cobby.

560
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,801
- 考比　- 相信我
- Cobby.  - Believe me.

561
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,304
他轻而易举就能搞到钱
He can dig it up without half-trying.

562
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:03,972
是的
Yes.

563
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,850
但如何跟他解释？我为什么需要钱？
But what do we tell him? Why do I need money?

564
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:10,353
交给我吧，考比总想成为大人物
Leave it to me. Cobby wants to feel big.

565
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,021
这就是他的机会
Here's his chance.

566
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:14,649
为伟大的阿隆佐·埃默瑞克筹集预付款
Advancing money for the great Alonzo P. Emmerich.

567
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,360
他会乐于这么做的
Ah, he'll do it.

568
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,612
他会为此出汗，但是他会做的
He'll sweat, but he'll do it.

569
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,948
你开过什么保险箱？
What boxes have you opened?

570
00:37:23,073 --> 00:37:26,911
防加农炮的，双门的，还有几种防火的，什么都有
Cannonball. Double door. Even a few fire chests. All of them.

571
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,831
你能打开那种带定时锁的金库吗？
Can you open a vault with a time lock and a relocking device?

572
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,042
- 当然能　- 你从哪里打开，锁还是缝？
- Sure.  - What do you use, lock or seam?

573
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,752
- 缝　- 曾经打开过吗？
- Seam.  - Ever taken one?

574
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:37,631
- 记得沙浮特失窃案吗？　- 是的，我坐牢时听说过
- Remember the Shafter job?  - Yes, I heard about it behind the walls.

575
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,841
那一票干得很棒
It was a good score.

576
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,677
- 谁给你提供液体炸药？　- 我自己配制
- Who supplies your soup?  - I thrash it myself.

577
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:46,348
- 你的撬锁水平如何？　- 我能在四分钟内撬开任何锁
- How are you as a picklock?  - I can open anything in four minutes.

578
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:48,600
- 他没问题　- 欢迎加入
- He'll do.  - You're in.

579
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:51,561
别急，我分账多少？
Not so fast. What's the cut?

580
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,189
不按比例分账，你会获得担保酬金
No cut. You get a flat guarantee.

581
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:58,026
- 我想要三万块钱　- 三万块钱？路易…
- I want 30,000.  - Thirty thousand? Now, Louis --

582
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,070
我们最多能出两万五千块钱
Twenty-five is what we figured.

583
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:01,988
- 好吧，首款一万五千块钱　- 首款一万块钱
- All right, 15 down.  - Ten down.

584
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,616
我认为一万五千块钱没问题
Fifteen is satisfactory, I think.

585
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,826
找他领钱吧
There's your paymaster.

586
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,843
你为什么流汗？
What are you sweating for?

587
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:27,054
钱让我流汗，我一直就这样
Money makes me sweat, that's all. It's the way I am.

588
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,812
- 博士，干这一票的都有谁？　- 还没找到人手
- Who are the others on this job, Doc?  - Haven't got them yet.

589
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:37,065
就我而言，车手的唯一人选是戈斯·米尼西
There's only one driver, as far as I'm concerned -- Gus Minissi.

590
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:40,193
- 问考比，他认识戈斯　- 戈斯？十分靠谱
- Ask Cobby. He knows him.  - Gus? Hundred percent.

591
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,612
- 那就叫上他　- 他能承担重压，绝不泄密
- Get hold of him.  - He'll take the heat and won't flap his lip.

592
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,948
- 那就叫上他　- 好的，博士
- Get hold of him.  - Sure, Doc.

593
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,825
认识可靠的恶棍吗？
Any ideas about a hooligan?

594
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,913
我认识一个非常棒的大块头，我很久没见他了
I know a very good heavy. I haven't seen him in some time.

595
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:53,040
- 瑞德·特雷纳　- 他还在养伤
- Red Traynor.  - He's taking the cure.

596
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:56,085
- 把他排除　- 提曼斯怎么样？
- Rule him out.  - What about Timmons?

597
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,753
- 那是谁？　- 我的门卫
- Who's that?  - My doorman.

598
00:38:57,878 --> 00:38:59,838
那个落魄的摔跤手？你在开玩笑吧？
That busted-down wrestler? Are you kidding?

599
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:02,424
他是一个四肢发达、头脑简单的家伙
He's got nothing upstairs but solid knuckle.

600
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:06,761
我是外地人，不像你们一样了解本地
I'm a stranger and do not know as much as you gentlemen.

601
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:10,139
那个叫迪克斯的南方人怎么样？
But what about this Southerner, this Dix?

602
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:14,811
他给我的印象是一个非常坚毅的男人，而且也不愚蠢
He impressed me as a very determined man and far from stupid.

603
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:20,316
实话说，我不喜欢那家伙，但我从未喜欢过任何恶棍
Frankly, I don't like the guy, but I never saw a hooligan I did like.

604
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:23,862
他们就像左撇子投球手，身上总有某种缺陷
They're like left-handed pitchers. They all have a screw loose somewhere.

605
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,615
我猜迪克斯跟别的人一样好
I suppose he's as good as anybody though.

606
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,160
戈斯觉得迪克斯很棒，而戈斯通常是对的
Gus thinks he's tops, and Gus is usually right.

607
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:32,912
我喜欢这个人，我们叫上他吧
I like him. I say we take him.

608
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,247
我随便，你是老板
Suits me. You're the boss.

609
00:39:35,372 --> 00:39:38,710
我最好回家，我太太还在担心孩子呢
Well, I better be getting home now. Mrs. Ciavelli's worried about the kid.

610
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:41,838
- 孩子怎么了？　- 他又着凉了
- What's the trouble?  - Oh, he's got a cold again.

611
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:45,091
我太太早晨带孩子出门，当时天冷
She takes him out first thing in the morning. It's cold then.

612
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,594
她声称婴儿应该呼吸新鲜空气
She claims a baby's gotta taste fresh air.

613
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,429
就像我总跟她讲的：
Like I'm always telling her,

614
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:52,557
「如果妳想呼吸新鲜空气，别指望这座城市！」
"If you want fresh air, don't look for it in this town!"

615
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,434
看看照片
Here.

616
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:00,607
这时他九个月大
He's nine months old there.

617
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:03,485
我得说，我嫉妒你这样的居家男人
I must say, I envy you being a family man.

618
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,028
是啊
Yeah.

619
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,697
幸福的烦恼，对吧？
Well, always problems, huh?

620
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:14,954
迪克斯·汉德利有一个好处，给他点钱他就满足了
One good thing about Dix Handley -- you can get him for nickels and dimes.

621
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,373
考比，我问你件事
Tell me something, Cobby.

622
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,209
刚才用的是你的钱，对吗？不是埃默瑞克先生的
It's your money, isn't it? Not Mr. Emmerich's.

623
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,880
- 有什么区别吗？　- 没有
- What difference does it make?  - None, really.

624
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:30,303
事情是这样，埃默瑞克先生不想让这笔交易出现在他的账面上
It's this way. Mr. Emmerich doesn't want this transaction appearing in his books.

625
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,306
我没有冒风险，他这么做也是怕出岔子
I'm not risking anything. He's good for it in case of a runout.

626
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,767
那你一点也不担心吗？
Then you haven't got a worry?

627
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,478
不担心
No.

628
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:46,611
- 妳要去哪里？　- 我找到住处了
- Where are you going?  - I found a place.

629
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:49,531
我有个闺蜜要离开本市，她让我住她的公寓
Girlfriend of mine's leaving town, and she's letting me have her apartment.

630
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:52,242
房租付到了月初
The rent's paid up till the first of the month.

631
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:53,868
妳什么时候联系她的？
When did all this happen?

632
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:57,121
今早，你还没睡醒，我在街上碰见了她
This morning, before you woke up. I bumped into her on the street.

633
00:40:57,246 --> 00:41:00,875
记得那个高挑黑发女人吗？她经常在乐团里跳新潮舞蹈
Remember that tall brunette, used to do the novelty dances at the Bandwagon?

634
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,504
布兰奇·拉露，她人真不错
Blanche La Rue. It sure was nice of her.

635
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:08,383
我不能总住在你这里，对吧？
I can't go living off you forever, can I?

636
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:11,261
- 我很高兴能帮助妳　- 嗯
- I was glad to help out.  - Yeah.

637
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:14,389
也许有机会我也能帮助你
Well, maybe I can do something for you sometime.

638
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,475
妳不欠我什么，算了
You don't owe me a thing. Forget it.

639
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,812
那么…
Well...

640
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:22,313
再见
good-bye.

641
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,316
- 妳还有钱吗？　- 我有几块钱，足够了
- How are you fixed for dough?  - A couple of bucks. Enough.

642
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:28,987
- 给，拿上这些钱…　- 不用，谢谢了，迪克斯
- Here, take this and --  - No. No, thanks, Dix.

643
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:31,114
我一直在打搅你
I'm all through bothering you.

644
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:34,283
我们吻别一下，如何？
Give us a kiss, huh?

645
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,304
朵儿
Doll.

646
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,139
迪克斯，什么事？
Yes, Dix?

647
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,980
也许我想要跟妳保持联系
Maybe I'll wanna get in touch with you.

648
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:07,150
噢，当然了，我的新地址
Oh. Oh, sure, my new address.

649
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,902
我住在默顿街４２号
I'll be at 42 Merton Street.

650
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:12,447
默顿街４２号
42 Merton.

651
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,549
- 喂？　<i>- 是迪克斯吗？</i>
- Hello.  <i>- Hello, Dix?</i>

652
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,217
- 是我　<i>- 我是考比</i>
- Yeah.  <i>- Dix, this is Cobby.</i>

653
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,969
- 你好，考比　<i>- 我找戈斯要到你的电话号码</i>
- Oh. How are ya, Cobby?  <i>- I got your number from Gus.</i>

654
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,764
- 嗯　<i>- 迪克斯，听着</i>
- Yeah.  <i>- Look, Dix.</i>

655
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:40,641
<i>你想做一笔大买卖吗？我是指真正的大买卖</i>
<i>Do you want to get into something big? I mean, real big.</i>

656
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:43,561
<i>如果你想做，今晚十点到戈斯的店铺</i>
<i>If you do, be at Gus's tonight at 10:00.</i>

657
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:44,938
好的
Right.

658
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:46,940
一切都已计划周密
Everything's here.

659
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:51,319
蒸汽管道处是软肋，检修井口就在街角
The soft spot's an old steam tunnel. Manhole's on the corner.

660
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:55,031
十一点四十五分，你进入检修井口，迪克斯帮你把风
You drop into the manhole at 11:45. Dix will cover you.

661
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,866
你把墙壁打穿
You break through the wall.

662
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:00,787
然后从暖气炉到贝拉提尔珠宝店，这大概要花六分钟
It'll take about six minutes to get into Belletier's from the furnace room.

663
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,622
小心地上的电线
Watch out for floor wires.

664
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:06,125
从后楼梯上去，躲开警报系统
Make your way up the back stairs and jump the alarm system.

665
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,252
这又要花三分钟
That'll take another three minutes.

666
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:13,424
十一点五十四分整，迪克斯和我会来到后门
At exactly 11:54, Dix and I will come to the back door.

667
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,385
你要给我们打开门
You open it for us.

668
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,929
- 我会等着你们　- 很好
- I'll be waiting for you.  - Good.

669
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:20,515
还有问题吗？
Any questions?

670
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,101
- 听上去一切很好　- 我也认为很好
- Everything sounds okay.  - Same here.

671
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:25,228
那么我就回家了
Well, guess I better be getting home.

672
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:27,271
- 你儿子怎么样？　- 他没事了
- How's the boy?  - Oh, he's okay.

673
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,816
他昨天发烧，体温相当高
Ran a temperature yesterday. Pretty high too.

674
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:33,152
我们打电话给医生，但发烧对孩子来说不算什么
We called the doctor, but temperatures don't mean so much with kids.

675
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,363
今天他又恢复正常了
He's back to normal today.

676
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:37,907
- 明晚十一点半再见　- 晚安
- See you tomorrow night, 11:30.  - Good night.

677
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:41,369
迪克斯，你有空吗？
Have you got a minute, Dix?

678
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:43,746
当然，你有什么事？
Sure. What's on your mind?

679
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:49,085
朋友，你了解埃默瑞克这家伙吗？
My friend, what do you know about this fellow Emmerich?

680
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:52,880
那个大律师？我仅仅听说过他的名字
You mean the big fixer? I've heard his name, that's all.

681
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,925
- 我可以跟你讲实话吧　- 当然
- I can talk to you, I think.  - Sure.

682
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:59,220
埃默瑞克先生想独吞我们的珠宝
Mr. Emmerich is taking the jewelry off our hands.

683
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:02,724
博士，你这话可吓到我了
You sure are surprising me, Doc.

684
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:05,268
我不完全信任埃默瑞克先生
I don't exactly trust Mr. Emmerich.

685
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:07,812
只是一种感觉，我可能是错的
It's just a feeling. I may be wrong.

686
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:10,857
但珠宝要由我们收集，你和我负责
But it's up to us to collect, you and me.

687
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:14,402
一切都应该很顺利，但如果不顺…
Everything may go smooth, but if it don't...

688
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:17,113
- 如果他变卦，我们收集珠宝　- 很对
- If he's got it, we'll collect.  - Good.

689
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:21,242
盗窃行动完成后，我们带着珠宝去找埃默瑞克先生拿钱
We'll meet Mr. Emmerich after the caper, deliver the jewelry and get our money.

690
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:23,870
他应该立即支付现金
The payment is to be immediate and in cash.

691
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:26,539
最后，我们付清报酬并各自分开
After that, we pay off and scatter.

692
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,126
别担心，博士，我们收集珠宝
Don't worry, Doc. We'll collect.

693
00:44:38,511 --> 00:44:41,514
（护照）

694
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:52,356
朗，是你吗？
Lon. Is that you?

695
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,526
- 朗！　- 是我，梅
- Lon!  - Yes, May.

696
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,697
进来，朗
Come in, Lon.

697
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,533
- 我有笔生意要谈　- 坐一会儿
- I've got a business appointment.  - Sit down a minute.

698
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:08,039
十一点半了，这么晚还谈生意吗？
It's 11:30. Isn't that rather late for business?

699
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:11,042
- 朗　- 梅，什么事？
- Lon.  - Yes, May?

700
00:45:11,168 --> 00:45:12,627
我身体不舒服
I'm not feeling well.

701
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:14,921
亲爱的，妳一直都身体不舒服
My dear, you haven't been feeling well for a long time.

702
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:16,589
我在晚上会紧张
At night, I get nervous.

703
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:20,384
我一紧张，我就讨厌独自待在这栋大房子里
And when I get nervous, I hate to stay in this big house all by myself.

704
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:23,929
梅，听着，妳不是独自一人，房子里有三个佣人呢
Look here. May, you're not here alone. There are three servants in the house.

705
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,890
- 妳想要什么就…　- 我知道，按铃
- All you have to...  - I know. Press a button.

706
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:29,435
那妳想让我做什么？
Well, what do you want me to do?

707
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,439
坐下，朗
Sit down, Lon.

708
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,568
好吧
All right.

709
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:40,780
我就坐在这里看妳读杂志吗？
Do I sit here and watch you read a magazine?

710
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:43,366
- 那样很糟糕吗？　- 不是的，梅…
- Would that be so awful?  - Oh, now, look, May --

711
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:45,326
我们可以玩牌
We could play cards.

712
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:48,079
- 就像以前一样赌牌　- 换个时间玩吧
- Casino, like we used to.  - Some other night.

713
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:51,290
朗，求求你，就玩一把
Please, Lon, just one hand.

714
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,626
昨晚我睡不着
I couldn't sleep last night.

715
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,920
然后我就想起了年轻时
Then I got to thinking of the old days,

716
00:45:56,045 --> 00:46:00,591
我们以前很喜欢一起赌牌，就我们俩
how we used to like to stay up and play casino, just the two of us.

717
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:04,387
是啊，我也想陪妳，但我不能
Yes. I-I wish I could stay, but I can't.

718
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,889
亲爱的，要谈生意
My dear, this is business.

719
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,559
不如这样，我稍后会来看妳
Uh, I tell you what I'll do. I'll look in later,

720
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:13,604
如果到时妳还醒着，我们就小玩一把
and if you're still awake, we'll have a little game.

721
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:40,256
（停车场）

722
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:45,636
请自己拿好钥匙，我们关门了
Take your keys, please. We're closing up.

723
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,388
好的
Okay.

724
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:58,441
- 准备就绪？　- 对
- All set?  - Yeah.

725
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,313
你最好小心这东西
Better be careful how you handle this stuff.

726
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,690
它能把你炸成碎片
They'll pick you up in little pieces.

727
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:46,841
你的表几点钟了？
What time have you got?

728
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,552
好的
Good.

729
00:49:04,484 --> 00:49:06,486
祝你好运，博士
Good luck, Doc.

730
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:09,238
他给你液体炸药了吗？
Did he give you the soup?

731
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,931
这里是红外线电子眼
Here's the electric eye.

732
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,133
液体炸药
Soup.

733
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:00,492
炸开这金库要多用点
It's gonna take a lot to blow this baby.

734
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,384
芝麻开门
Here goes.

735
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:37,881
- 什么声音？　- 继续
- What's that?  - Keep going.

736
00:53:44,806 --> 00:53:47,308
博士，整个街区的警报都响了
Hey, Doc, alarms are going off all over the block.

737
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:49,811
- 爆炸震动了整个警报系统　- 我们怎么办？
- The blast must've shook up the whole system.  - What do we do?

738
00:53:49,936 --> 00:53:52,438
现在离开我会后悔，就快得手了
I would hate to leave now. We're so close.

739
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:55,232
- 我想做完再走　- 路易，你呢？
- I'm for finishing what we started.  - How about you, Louis?

740
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:57,359
- 我没问题　- 戈斯会一直等着吗？
- It's okay with me.  - Will Gus hold still?

741
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,486
不用担心戈斯
Don't worry about Gus.

742
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:06,076
怎么了？
What's the matter?

743
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,036
钻头坏了
The drill broke.

744
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:13,792
我们应该在十二点十五分前完成，那时夜间保安会来
We should finish before 12:15, before the watchman gets here.

745
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,211
店铺警卫？让我来对付他
The store cop? Let me worry about him.

746
00:54:20,717 --> 00:54:22,426
- 迪克斯，听见了吗？　- 听见了
- Hear that, Dix?  - Yeah.

747
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:24,595
- 正往这边来吗？　- 从河边过来，听起来不妙
- Coming this way?  - From the river. Don't sound good.

748
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,722
迪克斯，你去看看怎么回事
Dix, take a look, see what's happening.

749
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:25,864
- 我们得闪人了，快！　- 这就是价值连城的宝贝
- We gotta blow, fast!  - This is everything of real value.

750
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,868
- 很重，是吧？　- 满满一包
- Heavy, ain't she?  - Plenty.

751
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:34,206
这是损失最大的盗窃案
This is the biggest one yet.

752
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,416
你们等着看报纸头条吧
Wait till you see it in the papers.

753
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:05,696
是夜间保安，路易，你把门拉开
Watchman. Pull open the door, Louis.

754
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:08,449
- 也许他会走远　- 照迪克斯的话做
- Maybe he'll go away.  - Do what Dix says.

755
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,328
就现在
Now.

756
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:21,336
跟着我
Follow me.

757
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:41,750
- 戈斯，带我回家　- 你哪里受伤？
- Gus, take me home.  - Where'd it get you?

758
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:44,837
射中大腿，我感觉子弹在往上钻，就像肚子里有虫
In the thigh. I feel it going up. Think I got the slug in my belly.

759
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:46,922
我带你去见个人，他曾经是医生
I'll take you to a guy, used to be a doctor.

760
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:48,966
不，带我回家，戈斯，带我回家
No, take me home, Gus. Take me home.

761
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:51,093
好吧，路易
All right, Louis.

762
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,325
一点多了，他们随时会来
It's after 1:00. They should be here any minute.

763
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:18,871
除非是出事了
Unless there's been trouble.

764
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:20,497
安吉拉今晚在哪里？
Where's Angela tonight?

765
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:23,208
噢，她在她姐姐那里
Hmm? Oh, she's at her sister's.

766
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:26,211
她这么说而已
She says.

767
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:28,880
如果我是你，我会少喝些酒
I'd go easy on that liquor if I were you.

768
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,466
喝得半醉，会让我比大多数人更机敏
Half-drunk, I got better wits than most people.

769
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:35,137
也更有勇气
And more nerve.

770
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:40,267
朋友，你看起来很紧张，有什么烦恼吗？
You look worried, my friend. Something bothering you?

771
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,146
生活真有趣
Ah, live and learn.

772
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:47,607
这些年来，我一直有自卑感
All these years, I've been suffering from an inferiority complex.

773
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:50,235
我应该在几年前就成为有钱人
I should've been in the money years ago.

774
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,904
你这个阔佬，你有什么可烦恼的？
You big boys, what have you got?

775
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:55,657
最好的，什么都用最好的
Front. Nothing but front.

776
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,826
但当你情况变糟时…
And when that slips --

777
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:01,830
我相信是我们的客人到了
I do believe our guests are arriving.

778
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,595
一切顺利吗？
Well, everything go all right?

779
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:21,475
这位是我的朋友，布兰姆先生
This is a friend of mine, Mr. Brannom.

780
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,727
他在本次交易上给了我很大帮助
He's been a great help to me on this deal.

781
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:26,104
跟我来，先生们
Follow me. Follow me, gentlemen.

782
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:28,231
这里面要舒服得多
It's much more comfortable in here.

783
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:42,496
我打赌那里面一定装满了奇珍异宝，对吧？
Say, I'll bet that thing is full of koh-i-noors and Grand Moguls, eh?

784
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:44,081
有可能
Could be.

785
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:47,125
先生们，坐下吧
Sit down, gentlemen. Sit down.

786
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,377
- 我给你们倒杯酒　- 不用，谢谢
- Let me get you a drink.  - No, thanks.

787
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:54,633
- 我们可以看一下吗？　- 你们当然可以看
- Do you mind if we have a look?  - You're entitled to a look, naturally.

788
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:17,572
- 确认了吗？　- 当然
- Convinced?  - Why, of course. Of course.

789
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:21,159
我从未怀疑过，我知道这家伙的信誉很好
There never was any doubt in my mind. I know this fellow's reputation.

790
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:23,870
只是有点好奇而已
Just a matter of curiosity, that's all.

791
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:29,752
- 我打赌这些估价超过了你的预期　- 行了，行了
- I'll bet the appraisal is going to exceed even your estimate.  - Good, good.

792
01:00:29,877 --> 01:00:32,629
既然如此，我只想看看你的钱
In that case, I'd just like to see the color of your money.

793
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:36,800
先生们，此刻我必须承认
Gentlemen, I must admit at this moment,

794
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:39,219
我…我觉得难堪
I, uh -- I'm embarrassed.

795
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,972
你的意思是你还没拿到钱？
You mean you haven't got the money, Mr. Emmerich?

796
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:44,891
我有钱，我保证能拿到钱
Oh, I have it. That is, I have the assurance of it.

797
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:46,268
但你还没拿到
You haven't got it.

798
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:50,271
对，我手上暂时还没有钱
No, I haven't got the currency right here in my hands.

799
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:53,191
可我发誓绝对能拿到
But it's promised by an unimpeachable source.

800
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:56,987
先生们，恐怕我们有点仓促，我们…我们行动得太快了
Gentlemen, I'm afraid we were a little hasty. We, uh -- We moved too fast.

801
01:00:57,112 --> 01:01:00,532
- 我们是照你说的做的　- 先等等
- We moved on your word.  - Well now, wait a minute.

802
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:04,453
那可是一大笔钱，尤其是鉴于目前的状况
That's a large sum of money, you know, considering present-day conditions,

803
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:07,497
尤其是鉴于我们必须用现金换取这些珠宝
and considering the fact that we had to have it in cash.

804
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:12,002
因此，恐怕我…还需要几天才能筹够钱
So I'm afraid... a few days more are needed to raise it.

805
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:15,964
埃默瑞克先生，几天时间对你来说也许不算太长
A few days more may not seem like a very long time to you, Mr. Emmerich.

806
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:19,509
但对我来说，带着这东西到处走，简直是度日如年
But to me, carrying this around, it would seem like years.

807
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:21,887
我能理解，我也有解决办法
I understand. I've got a solution for that too.

808
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:24,014
你们得信任我
That is, if you boys trust me.

809
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:29,394
如果你们不信任我，除了抱歉外我也无话可说
And if you don't, well, there's nothing I can say except that I'm, uh, sorry.

810
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:33,481
埃默瑞克先生，你到底想说什么？
Mr. Emmerich, what are you trying to tell us?

811
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:36,067
当然是关于珠宝
About the jewels.

812
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:39,529
你们带着珠宝到处走动不安全，你自己也这么说
Wouldn't be safe for you to carry that stuff around. You said so yourself.

813
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:42,991
- 你的意思是，让我们把珠宝留给你？　- 听我解释
- You mean, we leave them with you?  - Well, now, look here.

814
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:45,285
当警方明早开始找这些珠宝时
When the police start looking for that stuff tomorrow morning,

815
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,412
他们不会来盘问我
they're not likely to call me up.

816
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:50,790
他们也不会派侦探来搜查我的房子
They're not likely to send detectives out to search my house, you know.

817
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:55,712
而博士你…你刚从监狱出来
You, on the other hand, Doc, you, uh -- you're just out of prison.

818
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:59,674
他们肯定会抓捕像你这样的江洋大盗
They're certainly gonna be looking for the big-timers like yourself.

819
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:05,847
你刚释放就发生入室盗窃案，某个聪明警察会将此关联起来
Some smart cop might even connect this burglary with your release.

820
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:14,397
情况就是这样
Well, th-there you are.

821
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:19,402
当然，正如我所说，这…这取决于你
Of course, as I said, y-you -- it's up to you.

822
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:22,656
你可以通过考比和我保持联系
You can keep in touch with me through Cobby.

823
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:25,742
埃默瑞克，你做得很好，但这行不通
You did a great job, Emmerich, but it's not workin'.

824
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:28,286
- 鲍勃！　- 埃默瑞克，你退后躲开
- Bob!  - Back away and keep out of this, Emmerich.

825
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:32,540
现在，你这农夫，把双手举起来
Now, you, farmer, get your hands up.

826
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:38,255
还有你，德国佬…把包扔在地板上
And you, Fritz... throw the bag on the floor.

827
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:40,882
扔到我脚边
Over here, by my feet.

828
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:44,844
扔的时候小心点，我可是获得过射击奖章
Be careful how you throw it. I got a pistol expert medal.

829
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:47,264
- 迪克斯，你说怎么办？　- 他也没办法
- What do you say, Dix?  - He's got no say.

830
01:02:47,399 --> 01:02:51,027
他要是轻举妄动，就别想再拿起铁叉铲粪
He makes a crooked move, he'll never pitch another forkful of manure.

831
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:55,480
博士，他搞定我们了，把包扔给他
He's got us, Doc. Toss him the bag.

832
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,607
你不像看起来那么笨
You're not as dumb as you look.

833
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:11,913
你算什么男人？
Are you a man or what?

834
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:15,250
试图背叛我，却又毫无胆量
Trying to gyp and double-cross me with no guts for it.

835
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:18,420
你在想什么？你还活着干什么？
What's inside of you? What's keeping you alive?

836
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:28,346
你为什么不杀死我？
Why don't you kill me?

837
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,558
- 你为什么停下？　- 好吧，先生…
- What's stopping you?  - Okay, mister --

838
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:34,769
迪克斯，听我说，别杀他，那样太便宜他了
Dix, listen to me. Don't kill him. It's too easy an out for him.

839
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:36,396
坐下，先生
Sit down, sir.

840
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:40,734
你为什么耍这种手段？
Whatever possessed you to pull such a stunt?

841
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:43,528
我…我破产了，面临倒闭
I wa -- I was broke, facing bankruptcy.

842
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:47,157
博士，他是目击者，他看见我干掉了那家伙，他会告发我！
Doc, he's a witness. He saw me knock off that guy. You think he wouldn't holler?

843
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:49,534
他现在的处境不会告发你
He's in no position to talk.

844
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:53,246
你和地板上那个人，本想如何处理珠宝？
What did you and your man there intend to do with the jewels?

845
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:56,124
离开城市，每次卖掉一点
Leave town. Sell them off a little at a time.

846
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:59,669
行不通，你卖了第一次后警方就会盯上你
No good. The police would have been on you after the first sale.

847
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:02,839
风声很紧时，你不能到处叫卖这东西
You can't go peddling stuff like this around when the heat's on.

848
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:05,132
博士，快闪人吧，别在这里浪费时间
Let's blow, Doc. Let's not fool around here any longer.

849
01:04:05,257 --> 01:04:06,508
迪克斯，耐心点
Be patient, Dix.

850
01:04:06,633 --> 01:04:09,929
埃默瑞克先生带我们落入陷阱，他也要带我们脱身
Mr. Emmerich got us into this hole, and he's going to get us out.

851
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:13,725
我救你的命并非因为我是人道主义者
I didn't save your life because I'm a lover of humanity.

852
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,102
我们带着整包珠宝会惹上麻烦
We're in trouble with this satchel full of jewels.

853
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:19,063
目前无法卖掉珠宝，那它们就只是垃圾
As things stand, it's just so much junk.

854
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:22,567
- 我也无能为力　- 不，你可以出力，埃默瑞克先生
- There's nothing I can do.  - Yes, there is, Mr. Emmerich.

855
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,861
你可以去保险公司谈判
You can go to the insurance company.

856
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:28,031
- 保险公司？　- 他们有理由和你谈判
- Insurance company?  - They'll listen to reason.

857
01:04:28,156 --> 01:04:30,200
保险公司要为珠宝失窃赔付昂贵的保险金
This is a very bad jolt for them,

858
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:33,870
他们很可能愿意买下这些珠宝减少损失，而且不会多嘴
and it's possible they'll be willing to buy the jewels back, no questions asked,

859
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:36,915
大概按四分之一的价值买下
for as high as 25% of what they're worth.

860
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,750
博士，快闪人吧
Doc, let's blow.

861
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:40,877
我明天去处理
I'll start on it tomorrow.

862
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:43,171
迅速点，埃默瑞克
Get busy, Emmerich.

863
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:46,424
记住，你本应和你朋友一起躺死在这里
And remember, you might have been lying here dead with your friend.

864
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:50,678
我通过考比和你联系吗？
Shall I get in touch with you through Cobby?

865
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:52,972
不，由我来联系你
No. I'll get in touch with you.

866
01:04:53,515 --> 01:04:55,016
迪克斯，走吧
Come on, Dix.

867
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:58,520
我建议你料理一下你朋友的后事
I advise you to clean up after your friend.

868
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:06,569
- 别给他喝水　- 他要喝水
- Don't give him any water.  - He asked for it.

869
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,572
- 我说了别给他喝水　- 放开我
- I said don't give him any water.  - Let go.

870
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:12,200
妳想害死他吗？他也许胃部受伤了
You wanna kill him? Maybe he's hurt in the stomach.

871
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:15,245
医生在哪里？他为什么还不来？
Where's the doctor? Why doesn't he come?

872
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:17,914
你说十分钟就来，可已经过去半小时了
You said ten minutes. It's half an hour.

873
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:21,459
这样下去路易会死的，为什么不让我送他去医院？
Louis'll die. Why can't I take my Louis to the hospital?

874
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,796
如果妳送路易去医院手术室，那妳就别想再见到他
If you take him to the hospital, into an operating room, you'll never see him again.

875
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,800
玛利亚，别担心，路易会好起来的
Take it easy, Maria. Louis's gonna be all right.

876
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:31,177
医生会完好如新地治愈他
The doctor will fix him up good as new.

877
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:33,847
妳和路易会再生六个孩子
You and Louis are gonna have six more kids.

878
01:05:33,972 --> 01:05:37,976
每个都白白胖胖，有黑色大眼睛，浓密的头发
All as fat as pigs, big black eyes, lots of hair.

879
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:39,853
就像路易一样，玛利亚，如何？
Just like Louis, eh, Maria?

880
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:41,813
离婴儿远点！
Stay away from the baby!

881
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:52,115
戈斯，跟我说实话，到底怎么回事？
Tell me the truth, Gus. How did it happen?

882
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,451
- 我跟妳说过，打架受伤　- 路易从不打架，这你知道
- I told you. A fight.  - Louis don't fight. You know that.

883
01:05:54,576 --> 01:05:55,827
好吧
All right.

884
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:59,122
为什么总是你？
Why is it always you?

885
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:01,541
每次路易遇到麻烦，总有你的份
Whenever Louis gets into trouble, you're around.

886
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:04,586
你这肮脏的瘸子！驼子！
You dirty cripple! You crooked back!

887
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:07,130
- 你就是邪恶化身！　- 玛利亚，闭上妳的嘴！
- You have the evil eye!  - Shut your mouth, Maria!

888
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:09,257
我不能容忍别人那样说我
I don't let anybody say that to me.

889
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:22,020
戈斯，对不起
I'm sorry, Gus,

890
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,689
但我必须发泄情绪
but I gotta blame somebody.

891
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:27,442
我后背上的东西，我出生时就有
What I carry on my back, I was born with it.

892
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:29,444
不是我要求它长出来的
I didn't grow it myself.

893
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:32,321
戈斯，请原谅我，我不是故意的
Please forgive me, Gus. I didn't mean it.

894
01:06:39,913 --> 01:06:43,625
- 你听那笛声　- 听到了，肯定失火了
- Listen to that.  - Yeah. Must be a fire.

895
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,085
但不在这附近，在别的地方
It's not in this neighborhood though. Someplace else.

896
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:50,006
戈斯，我祈祷那个医生快点到来
Oh, Gus. I pray to God that doctor get here quick.

897
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:52,467
他随时会到，玛利亚
Aw, he'll be here any minute, Maria.

898
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,722
听起来像地狱里幽魂的声音
Sounds like a soul in hell.

899
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:46,521
迪克斯，你为什么不联系戈斯，让他带你去看那个医生
Dix, why don't you get in touch with Gus and let him take you to that doctor.

900
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:47,939
别犯傻
Don't be foolish.

901
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:50,733
我不喜欢医生，我根本没事
I don't like doctors. I'm getting along all right.

902
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:54,279
子弹只是擦破了我的外皮，然后飞走了
That bullet just ripped through my side and went on about its business.

903
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:57,615
- 幸好我跳开了　- 事情怎么会变成这样？
- Good thing I jumped.  - How can things go so wrong?

904
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:01,077
这怎么可能？一个人被杀死，两个人挨枪子
How is it possible? One man killed, two others plugged.

905
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:04,956
我出了三万块钱，我们得到一堆宝石却无法贩卖
I'm out 30 grand. We got a load of rocks we can't even peddle.

906
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:07,792
别发牢骚了，给我倒点波旁威士忌
Why don't you quit cryin' and get me some bourbon.

907
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:14,716
我真是愚蠢至极
I must be awful stupid.

908
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:17,093
我这里有很好的生意
Here I am with a good business,

909
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:19,804
财源滚滚
money rolling in.

910
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:22,223
我却卷进了这样的破事里
I-I gotta get mixed up in a thing like this.

911
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:26,352
我真该检查一下我的脑子
I ought to have my head examined.

912
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:31,983
喂，你好，对，我是考比
Yeah, hello, hello. Yeah, this is Cobby.

913
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:34,360
什么？
What?

914
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:37,363
是戈斯，抓捕网已经撒开，警方正在搜查整个地区
It's Gus. Dragnet's out, and they're combing the district.

915
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:40,033
迪克斯，他要跟你说话
He wants to talk to you. You, Dix.

916
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:45,705
- 戈斯？我是迪克斯　- 仔细听我说，哥们儿
- Gus? Dix.  - Yeah, now listen careful, pal.

917
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:49,250
警方正在搜查街道上的每家店铺和车辆
The cops are knocking over joints along the boulevard, meat wagons and all.

918
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,920
听着，我给一个人打过电话，他叫艾迪·德纳托
Now, look. I already called a guy, Eddie Donato.

919
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:54,964
德纳托在河边有一家食品杂货店，在前街１１６号
Donato's got a grocery down by the river. 116 Front Street.

920
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:57,926
- 你记住了吗？　<i>- 是的，戈斯，谢谢，路易怎么样？</i>
- You got that? Okay.  <i>- Yeah. Thanks, Gus. How's Louis?</i>

921
01:08:58,051 --> 01:09:00,845
路易不太好，他肚子里有一颗子弹，医生正在尽全力
Louis is not so good. He got a slug in his belly. Doc's doing all he can.

922
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:03,389
现在他们来了，那些警察小子
Yeah, here they are now, the happiness boys.

923
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:06,226
喂，你好吗？看来我要加班了
Hello. How are you? Looks like I'm in for a working-over.

924
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:09,020
听着，去艾迪的店铺要走旧车库那条路
Look, go down to Eddie's by way of the old car barn.

925
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,439
晚上那里没人，只要你通过那里就会没事
It's deserted at night. Once you get beyond that, you're okay.

926
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,274
警察从不到艾迪店铺的附近去
The cops never bother Eddie's neighborhood.

927
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,152
再见，迪克斯，赶紧闪人吧
So long, Dix. Blow now, huh?

928
01:09:15,278 --> 01:09:17,114
来了，来了，来了
All right, all right, all right.

929
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:21,953
（艾迪·德纳托食品杂货店）

930
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:26,412
什么？请大声点
What? Uh, please, talk a little louder.

931
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:28,039
我是艾迪·德纳托
This is Eddie Donato.

932
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:30,833
噢，当然，我叫博士来接
Oh, sure, sure. I'll get-a Doc for you.

933
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:33,044
<i>[ 意大利语 ] 博士，</i>是你的人
Hey, <i>dottore,</i> I got your man.

934
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:38,675
喂？
Hello?

935
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:41,135
是的
Yes.

936
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:44,013
可以，很好
Fine, fine. Good.

937
01:09:44,806 --> 01:09:46,599
那也足够满意
That'll be satisfactory.

938
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:55,149
- 考比？　- 是的
- Cobby?  - Yes.

939
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:58,987
埃默瑞克搞定了，保险公司说可以买回珠宝
Emmerich came through. The insurance people say okay.

940
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:02,031
当然，必须等到星期一早上银行开门
Of course, we'll have to wait till the banks open Monday morning,

941
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:05,827
只有二十五万美元，但也不错
but it's 250,000, which is not bad.

942
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:11,332
怎么了？
What's the matter?

943
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:13,459
朗，作为律师，你也许非常精明
As a lawyer, you may be very brilliant, Lon,

944
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:16,587
- 但作为赌牌玩家，你还要学习很多事　- 是啊
- but as a casino player, you have a lot to learn.  - Yeah.

945
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:19,507
- 妳不介意我抽烟吧？　- 当然不介意，朗
- You don't mind if I smoke, do you?  - Of course not, Lon.

946
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:21,134
- 出牌　- 朗
- Oh, here.  - Lon.

947
01:10:21,259 --> 01:10:25,263
你怎么能这样玩？这手牌你一分也得不到
How could you make a play like that? You won't make a single point this hand.

948
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:27,014
进来
Come in.

949
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:30,559
先生，有两位男士要见你，他们是从警察部门来的
Two gentlemen to see you, sir. They are from the police department.

950
01:10:30,685 --> 01:10:33,187
朗，他们来干什么？
What on earth could they want, Lon?

951
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:36,065
我猜可能和某个辩护案件有关吧
Oh, something to do with a case, I suppose.

952
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:39,110
- 失陪一下　- 真扫兴，我们玩得正开心呢
- Excuse me?  - Oh, bother. We were having so much fun.

953
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,320
- 快点回来　- 当然
- Hurry back.  - Sure.

954
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,795
- 什么事？　- 埃默瑞克先生，很抱歉打扰你
- Yes?  - Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Emmerich.

955
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,381
我是安德鲁，这位是詹诺切克警官
I'm Andrews. This is Officer Janocek.

956
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:02,634
- 幸会　- 你好
- How do you do?  - How are you?

957
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:05,553
呃，我能为你们做什么？
Well, uh, what can I do for you?

958
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:07,889
你认识一个叫鲍勃·布兰姆的人吗？
Do you know a man named Robert Brannom?

959
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:09,724
布兰姆，当然认识
Brannom. Yes, of course.

960
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:11,851
怎么了？发生大事了吗？
What is it? Something the matter?

961
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:13,686
是的，埃默瑞克先生
There sure is, Mr. Emmerich.

962
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:16,230
今早在河里发现他的尸体
His body was pulled out of the river this morning.

963
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:19,484
- 老天呐　- 但不是淹死的
- Great heavens.  - But it was no drowning.

964
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:22,695
他胸前有个洞，他是被枪杀的
He had a hole through his pump. He'd been shot.

965
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:27,283
呃，你们能进去谈吗？
Will you, uh, step in here for a minute?

966
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:34,290
我得说，这真是…
Well, I must say, this is, uh --

967
01:11:35,082 --> 01:11:37,126
这真令人吃惊，鲍勃·布兰姆？
It's quite a shock. Bob Brannom, eh?

968
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:40,129
你说他是被谋杀的？老天呐
Murdered, you say? Great heavens.

969
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:44,384
我们在他的衣兜里发现一张名单，是用你的商业信笺写的
We found a list of names in his pocket written on your business stationery.

970
01:11:44,509 --> 01:11:48,179
- 这些人是谁？你认识吗？　- 这是我的欠债者名单
- Who are these people, do you know?  - Oh, that's a list of my debtors.

971
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:51,474
布兰姆为我工作，他正在收回那些旧债
Brannom was working for me. He was trying to collect some old debts.

972
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:53,601
我得说，没取得太大成功
Without much success, I must say.

973
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:55,853
他跟这名单上的什么人有过节吗？
Was he giving the treatment to anybody on this list?

974
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:58,188
「过节」？当然没有
"Giving the treatment"? Certainly not.

975
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:03,194
你觉得他为你工作这件事与他的死没有任何关联吗？
You don't think there's any connection between this work for you and his death?

976
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:05,363
- 完全没关联　- 你最后一次见他是什么时候？
- None whatever.  - When did you see him last?

977
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:08,616
上周三夜晚，就在这房间里
Well now, last Wednesday evening in this room.

978
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:12,245
- 我们一起看了遍那份名单　- 嗯哼
- Yes. We went over that list together.  - Mm-hmm.

979
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:15,373
验尸官说，他是今天凌晨一点或两点钟被打死的
The coroner says he was plugged about 1:00 or 2:00 this morning.

980
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:17,792
比贝拉提尔珠宝店失窃案稍晚一些
Not much after the Belletier job was pulled.

981
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:20,253
我们认为这之间可能有关联
We figure there might be a connection.

982
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:22,547
我们知道其中一个盗贼受了枪伤
One of the heist guys was shot. We know that.

983
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:25,508
珠宝店的地板上有血迹，也许就是布兰姆的
There was blood on the floor. Maybe it was Brannom's.

984
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:28,469
他可能死在逃跑的车中，然后同伙把他扔进了河里
He could've died in the getaway car and the others dropped him in the river.

985
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,304
噢，不，不
Oh, no, no, no.

986
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:33,307
鲍勃·布兰姆虽是粗野之人，但他不是罪犯
Bob Brannom's a good deal of a roughneck, but he's no criminal,

987
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:38,271
据我判断，贝拉提尔珠宝店失窃案是职业大盗所为
and if I'm any judge, Belletier's was the work of big-time professionals.

988
01:12:38,396 --> 01:12:41,732
不，先生们，鲍勃·布兰姆卷进了入室盗窃案
Oh, no, no, gentlemen. Bob Brannom mixed up in any burglary.

989
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:44,193
这是难以想象的事
Why, that's inconceivable.

990
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:46,195
我明白了
I see.

991
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:50,032
埃默瑞克先生，还有一件事，当然只是为了留作记录
Oh, uh, one more thing, Mr. Emmerich. Just for the record, of course.

992
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:53,410
可以告诉我们昨晚你在哪里吗？
Could you give us an account of your whereabouts last night?

993
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:55,037
可以
Yes, I could.

994
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:57,915
为什么？有这个必要吗？
Why? Is it necessary?

995
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,042
恐怕有必要，埃默瑞克先生
I'm afraid so, Mr. Emmerich.

996
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:03,629
小伙子们，我这把年纪的人很讨厌坦白这种事
Well, boys, a man of my years hates to make an admission like this,

997
01:13:03,754 --> 01:13:07,800
有一位芬利小姐住在我河边的小别墅里
but a Miss Phinlay is living in my cottage on the river.

998
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:13,806
昨晚我去拜访她了，大概是十一点半
And last night, I went to visit her at about, uh, 11:30, I think it was.

999
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:16,475
待到很晚
Stayed rather late.

1000
01:13:16,601 --> 01:13:19,228
当然，她会证实这一点
Oh, she'll verify this, of course.

1001
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:24,442
但小伙子们…稍微谨慎点，好吗？
Oh, but, boys -- use a little discretion, eh?

1002
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:26,569
当然，除非这有某种用途
Unless, of course, it serves some useful purpose.

1003
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:29,781
我理解，埃默瑞克先生，非常感谢你的帮助
I understand, Mr. Emmerich, and thank you very much for your help.

1004
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:32,033
没什么，谢谢你们
Not at all. Thank you.

1005
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:34,786
另外，如果我还能帮上什么忙，你们随时找我
And say, if I can be any further help, you just call on me.

1006
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:36,913
- 祝今天愉快　- 祝今天愉快
- Good day.  - Good day.

1007
01:13:54,389 --> 01:13:55,890
- 喂，是安吉拉吗？　<i>- 是的</i>
- Hello, Angela?  <i>- Yes.</i>

1008
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:58,100
- 我是朗　<i>- 朗大叔，你为什么不给我打电话？</i>
- This is Lon.  <i>- Uncle Lon, why haven't you called?</i>

1009
01:13:58,225 --> 01:14:00,645
宝贝，听着，警方可能会拜访妳
Listen, baby, you may have a visit from the police.

1010
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:03,105
<i>- 是因为你妻子吗？</i>　- 不是
<i>- Is it your wife?</i>  - No, no.

1011
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:05,066
不是那样的
No, it's nothing like that.

1012
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:08,319
他们很可能会问妳一些关于昨晚的事
They'll probably ask you some questions about last night.

1013
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:10,154
宝贝，现在听着
Now, listen, baby.

1014
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:13,533
我要妳告诉他们昨晚我和妳在一起
I want you to tell them that I was there with you

1015
01:14:13,658 --> 01:14:17,119
从晚上十一点半直到凌晨三点
from, uh, 11:30 until 3:00 in the morning.

1016
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:19,997
<i>- 几乎一整夜</i>　- 是的，几乎一整夜
<i>- That's most of the night.</i>  - Most of the night. That's right.

1017
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:22,124
- 妳听明白了吗？　<i>- 当然，我明白</i>
- Now, is that clear?  <i>- Sure, it's clear.</i>

1018
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:25,919
不，宝贝，这只是有关政治
Yes. Oh, no, no. Just politics, baby.

1019
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:28,464
- 千年不变的肮脏政治游戏　<i>- 好吧，到时给我打电话</i>
- Good old dirty politics.  <i>- All right. Call me right away.</i>

1020
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:30,591
好的，我稍后给妳打电话
Yes. Yes, I'll call you later.

1021
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,218
<i>- 别忘了</i>　- 是
<i>- Don't forget.</i>  - Yes.

1022
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:48,985
我们继续玩吗？
Can we go on playing?

1023
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:51,821
当然，为什么不呢？
Certainly. Why not?

1024
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:55,950
朗，你的脸色像鬼一样苍白
Why, Lon, you're as pale as a ghost.

1025
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:57,660
怎么回事？
What's the matter?

1026
01:14:57,785 --> 01:14:58,995
我…
Oh, I --

1027
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:02,289
我刚听到一个坏消息
Well, I just had some bad news.

1028
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:05,334
一个为我工作的人死去了
A man who works for me got killed.

1029
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:08,170
朗，太可怕了，是意外吗？
Oh, Lon, how awful. Was it an accident?

1030
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:09,755
不是
No.

1031
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,632
不，那是…
No, it was, uh,

1032
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,177
蓄意谋杀
an intentional killing.

1033
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:17,930
- 他们知道凶手是谁吗？　- 不知道
- Do they know who did it?  - No.

1034
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:22,101
朗，我一想到你和那些可怕的人打交道…
Oh, Lon, when I think of all those awful people you come in contact with --

1035
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:25,396
那些十足的罪犯…我感到害怕
downright criminals -- I get scared.

1036
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:30,276
噢，他们其实没什么不同
Oh, there's nothing's so different about them.

1037
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:34,113
毕竟，犯罪只是…
After all, crime is only...

1038
01:15:34,905 --> 01:15:37,908
人类行为的一种偏差而已
a left-handed form of human endeavor.

1039
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:46,208
- 迪克斯，你去过墨西哥城吗？　- 没有
- Ever been in Mexico City, Dix?  - Nope.

1040
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:49,712
它海拔八千英尺高，空气非常纯净
It's 8,000 feet up. The air is very pure.

1041
01:15:49,837 --> 01:15:53,799
有许多一流俱乐部和饭店，还有一处赛马场
Many first-class clubs and restaurants, a horse track

1042
01:15:53,924 --> 01:15:55,718
以及姑娘们
and girls.

1043
01:15:55,843 --> 01:15:57,470
年轻美貌的姑娘们
Beautiful young girls.

1044
01:15:58,137 --> 01:16:00,389
如果有人为你付账，你愿意去那里吗？
How would you like to go there, all expenses paid?

1045
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:02,975
抱歉，博士，不感兴趣，我要回老家
Sorry, Doc, not interested. I'm headin' home.

1046
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:05,727
迪克斯，你总是能回老家的
Listen, Dix. You can always go home.

1047
01:16:05,853 --> 01:16:07,813
可等你真回去了，又觉得毫无意义
And when you do, it's nothing.

1048
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:10,566
相信我，我回过老家，毫无意义
Believe me. I've done it. Nothing.

1049
01:16:11,192 --> 01:16:13,194
我已经决定了
My mind's made up.

1050
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:15,279
是我
It's me.

1051
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:18,199
看呐，朋友们
Look, my friends.

1052
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,701
朋友们
My friends,

1053
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:23,370
我是个可敬的人
I am a respectable man.

1054
01:16:23,496 --> 01:16:25,873
为了戈斯，我做了人情
For Gus, I do a favor, all right.

1055
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:29,960
（悬赏珠宝盗窃疑犯）
- 看看报纸上的照片…　- 艾迪，你是想要我们闪人吗？好吧
- With this picture in the paper --  - You want us to blow, right, Eddie? Okay.

1056
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:32,129
我们越早离开这里越好
The sooner we get out of here, the better.

1057
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,967
我们的朋友艾迪要去鼓励举报的地方了
Our friend Eddie's getting to the place where he'd talk with encouragement.

1058
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:38,052
不，我不会举报的
Oh, no. I no talk.

1059
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:40,179
否则戈斯会割破我的肚子
Gus cut my belly open.

1060
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:42,765
朋友们，我很抱歉给你们带来这个坏消息
I'm sorry, my friends, to bring you this bad news.

1061
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:45,226
- 我现在就走　- 坐下，德纳托
- I go now, please.  - Sit down, Donato.

1062
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:48,145
我没叫你走，你哪里也不准去
You're not going anyplace till I say so.

1063
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:52,608
待着，艾迪
Stay put, Eddie.

1064
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:56,445
只要你老实坐在这里并闭上你的嘴，就没人会伤害你
Nobody's gonna hurt you so long as you sit still and keep your mouth shut.

1065
01:16:58,114 --> 01:17:01,159
我觉得是保险公司向警方告发了那个大骗子
The way I figure, the insurance guys must have sicced the cops on that big phony,

1066
01:17:01,284 --> 01:17:02,911
然后他就泄露了
and he spilled.

1067
01:17:03,036 --> 01:17:05,455
博士，你就不该阻止我一枪打死他
You never should've stopped me, Doc, when I was gonna blast him.

1068
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:08,041
不，埃默瑞克没有泄露
No, Dix, he hasn't spilled,

1069
01:17:08,166 --> 01:17:11,711
- 否则警方不会只找我一个人　- 那是怎么回事？
- or they wouldn't be looking for just me.  - Then how come?

1070
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:15,715
因为只有三、四个人能干此类大案子
Because there's only three or four men who can manage a job like this.

1071
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:19,510
警局里某个有点脑子的人已经认定我就是疑犯
Somebody in the department with a few brains has decided I'm the guy.

1072
01:17:19,844 --> 01:17:21,804
我已经想到这点了
I've been half expecting it.

1073
01:17:21,929 --> 01:17:23,889
我并不怎么担心
It doesn't worry me much.

1074
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:26,600
我们明天就能拿到钱
We'll get our money tomorrow, you bet.

1075
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:28,394
我希望如此
I hope so.

1076
01:17:28,519 --> 01:17:30,729
- 迪克斯，我们去哪里？　- 我知道一个地方
- Where we going, Dix?  - I know a place.

1077
01:17:31,438 --> 01:17:35,609
艾迪，如果你足够聪明，就当作从未见过我们
Eddie, if you're a smart boy, you'll forget you ever seen us.

1078
01:17:42,575 --> 01:17:44,869
- 我想见局长　- 陈述你的目的
- I wanna see the commissioner.  - State your business.

1079
01:17:44,994 --> 01:17:48,247
我是一个公民，如果我想那我就可以见局长，不是吗？
Look, I'm a citizen. I can see the commissioner if I want to, can't I?

1080
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:50,583
- 是关于瑞登施奈德吗？　- 有可能
- Is it about Riedenschneider?  - Could be.

1081
01:17:51,042 --> 01:17:53,044
那家伙当然在附近
He sure gets around, that guy.

1082
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:56,422
大概有五千人在过去二十四小时内见过他
About 5,000 people have seen him in the last 24 hours.

1083
01:17:56,547 --> 01:18:00,009
你去那里排队等候，轮到你时你就可以讲了
If you get in that line over there and wait your turn, you can tell your story.

1084
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:01,885
除局长以外我不会跟任何人讲
I won't tell anybody but the commissioner.

1085
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:05,013
好吧，伙计，坐下等候，但可能要花些时间
Okay, okay. Sit down and wait, buddy. But it may be some time.

1086
01:18:05,138 --> 01:18:06,639
好的
Okay.

1087
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:09,435
我想要见局长
I'd like to see the commissioner.

1088
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:24,408
你们要去哪里？
Where do you think you're going?

1089
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,952
- 我们正要回家　- 是吗？
- We're on our way home.  - Yeah?

1090
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:29,705
- 你们住在哪里？　- 卡姆登南边
- Where do you live?  - South on Camden.

1091
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:33,667
你们没事别来这里，这里是市政府财产，到处都已标记
You guys got no business in here. This is city property. There are signs.

1092
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:35,628
- 人人都在用　- 可不是嘛
- Everybody uses it.  - You're telling me.

1093
01:18:35,753 --> 01:18:38,047
甚至一群恶棍都带年轻姑娘们来这里厮混
Even a bunch of hoodlums have been bringing young girls here.

1094
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:39,840
- 那是真的吗？　- 是的
- Is that a fact?  - Yeah.

1095
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:43,010
我们的一个同袍因为争执而丢了工作
It's cost one of our boys his job on account of the beefs.

1096
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:45,637
如果我是你们，我就会远离这里，明白吗？
If I were you guys, I'd stay out of here. You understand?

1097
01:18:45,762 --> 01:18:47,264
好的，警官
Okay, Officer.

1098
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:50,851
嘿，等等
Hey, wait a minute.

1099
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:53,228
你，拎包的那个，过来
You, with the bag, come here.

1100
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:38,440
迪克斯
Oh, Dix.

1101
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:41,986
迪克斯，亲爱的
Oh, Dix, honey.

1102
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:44,655
你得原谅我
You'll have to excuse me.

1103
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:48,576
我吃了几片安眠药，我仍然感觉晕乎乎的
I took a couple of sleeping pills, and I guess I'm still kind of groggy.

1104
01:19:48,701 --> 01:19:51,453
我最近总睡不着，迪克斯
I haven't been able to sleep much lately, Dix,

1105
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:53,622
我担心着你的一切
worrying about you and everything.

1106
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:57,459
我去过你住的地方，他们跟我说警方正在抓你
I was up at your place. They told me the cops were after you.

1107
01:19:57,584 --> 01:20:00,129
给我弄些冷水和毛巾，不要瞎扯了
Get me some cold water and some towels and stop yapping.

1108
01:20:00,254 --> 01:20:02,214
当然可以，迪克斯
Well, sure, Dix. Sure.

1109
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:04,216
- 快点去　- 好的
- Get a move on.  - Oh, you bet.

1110
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:06,385
花了那么长时间策划
Put in hours and hours of planning.

1111
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:10,806
详细计算每一件事情，然后怎么样？
Figure everything down to the last detail. Then what?

1112
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:14,685
防盗警报无缘无故地四处乱响
Burglar alarms start going off all over the place for no sensible reason.

1113
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:17,521
一把枪自动开火，而一个人被击中
A gun fires of its own accord, and a man is shot,

1114
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:20,649
还有一个下流老头，除了追求女孩子什么也不擅长
and a broken-down old harness bull, no good for anything but chasing kids,

1115
01:20:20,774 --> 01:20:22,943
这些差点绊倒我们，纯属意外
has to trip over us. Blind accident.

1116
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:25,320
出现意外状况你能怎么办？
What can you do against blind accident?

1117
01:20:25,446 --> 01:20:27,907
我应该意识到但却没做的一件事就是埃默瑞克
One thing I ought to have figured and didn't was Emmerich.

1118
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:30,743
我知道我为什么没意识到，我不能再欺骗自己
I know why I didn't. I'm not kidding myself.

1119
01:20:30,868 --> 01:20:32,703
是因为他承诺会给额外的钱
It was the extra dough he promised.

1120
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:35,915
我太饥渴了，贪婪使我盲目
I got hungry. Greed made me blind.

1121
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:39,543
嘿，迪克斯，他不就是报纸上悬赏的那个人吗？
Hey, Dix. Dix, isn't he the one with the reward on him?

1122
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:41,503
妳别管闲事
Mind your own business.

1123
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:47,968
她证实了埃默瑞克说的话，深夜十一点半到三点，他们在一起
She confirmed what Emmerich said, that he was with her from 11:30 till 3:00.

1124
01:20:48,094 --> 01:20:50,304
- 她给你的印象如何？　- 非常深刻
- How did she impress you?  - Very much.

1125
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:52,556
- 她真是个宝贝　- 我不是这个意思
- She's some babe.  - That's not what I mean.

1126
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:54,641
她的态度坦率吗？
Was her manner straightforward?

1127
01:20:54,766 --> 01:20:57,394
噢，我猜她说的是真话
Oh, I guess she was telling the truth, all right.

1128
01:20:58,145 --> 01:20:59,647
结婚二十年了
Married 20 years.

1129
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:03,317
却还包养一个足够做他孙女的年轻女人，真恶心
Consorting with a woman young enough to be his granddaughter. It's disgusting.

1130
01:21:03,442 --> 01:21:05,444
但埃默瑞克这种人并不会让我惊讶
But nothing about Emmerich would surprise me.

1131
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:08,155
他受过教育，懂得用脑子规避法律
Educated man who uses his brains to circumvent the law.

1132
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,616
最差的一种人，不用为他辩解
Worst type of human being. No excuse for him.

1133
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:12,284
- 局长，打扰一下　- 什么事？
- Excuse me, Commissioner.  - Well?

1134
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:14,453
外面有个出租车司机在等候
There's a taxi driver been waiting outside.

1135
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:17,414
- 他说有一些重要情报　- 关于什么的？
- Says he's got some important information.  - Concerning what?

1136
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:20,709
我试过问他，但他说除你以外不会跟任何人讲
I-I tried to find out, but he wouldn't talk to anyone but you.

1137
01:21:20,834 --> 01:21:22,378
他等候两个小时了
He's been waiting two hours.

1138
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:24,589
- 好吧，让他进来　- 是，长官
- All right, send him in.  - Yes, sir.

1139
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:30,636
- 你叫什么名字？　- 查尔斯·怀特
- What's your name?  - Charles Wright.

1140
01:21:30,761 --> 01:21:33,347
出租车司机工号１４８０３，绿带公司
Hackie number 14803. Green Stripe Company.

1141
01:21:33,472 --> 01:21:34,973
你的情报是什么？
What's this information you've got?

1142
01:21:35,098 --> 01:21:38,351
所有人都在找的那个小老头博士，他坐过我的车
The little doctor everybody's looking for. I think I had him for a fare.

1143
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:41,480
- 你把他载到了某个地方？　- 现在我很肯定就是他
- You drove him someplace?  - Well, now I'm pretty sure it was him

1144
01:21:41,605 --> 01:21:44,608
一周前的星期五，我在火车站载的他
I picked up at the station a week ago Friday.

1145
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:46,318
- １６号星期五？　- 是的，先生
- Friday the 16th?  - Yes, sir.

1146
01:21:46,443 --> 01:21:48,695
- 你把他载到哪里？　- 卡姆登西区的一个门牌号
- Where'd you take him?  - To a number on Camden West.

1147
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:51,198
我记得是因为我问过是否需要我等他
I remember because I asked if he wanted me to wait.

1148
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:53,992
我认识的一个人在卡姆登西区被打劫过
I know a fella that got rolled once on Camden West.

1149
01:21:54,118 --> 01:21:56,370
他身上没钱，劫匪就抢走了他的裤子和鞋子
He didn't have nothin', so they stole his pants and shoes.

1150
01:21:56,495 --> 01:21:58,497
你把他载到哪里？门牌号是什么？
Where did you take him? What number?

1151
01:22:00,082 --> 01:22:03,460
４７１７，像是一间仓库，当时天很黑
4717. Kind of a storeroom. It was dark.

1152
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:05,838
- 再说一遍门牌号？　- ４７１７
- What's that number again?  - 4717.

1153
01:22:05,963 --> 01:22:08,215
局长，那里曾是个赌注登记场所
Used to be a bookie joint, Commissioner.

1154
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:11,218
给我接通迪崔克警长
Get hold of Lieutenant Ditrich.

1155
01:22:14,806 --> 01:22:16,307
对，就是他
Yeah, that's him.

1156
01:22:16,432 --> 01:22:19,518
刚开始我还觉得来这里是很傻的一件事
At first I thought I was making a fool of myself by coming here.

1157
01:22:19,643 --> 01:22:21,520
但那人就是他，局长
But that's him all right, Commissioner.

1158
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:25,649
- 你可能得到赏金，我希望如此　<i>- 迪崔克警长在一号线</i>
- You may be in for a reward. I hope so.  <i>- Lieutenant Ditrich on one.</i>

1159
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,696
- 迪崔克，你在哪里？　<i>- 我在第四街车站，局长</i>
- Where are you, Ditrich?  <i>- I'm at 4th Street Station, Commissioner.</i>

1160
01:22:30,821 --> 01:22:35,659
现在办一张搜查令，然后去卡姆登西区４７１７号
All right. Now, get a search warrant and go to 4717 Camden West.

1161
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:38,161
- 瑞登施奈德去过那里　<i>- 是４７１７号吗？</i>
- Riedenschneider was seen there.  <i>- That's 4717?</i>

1162
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:42,290
是的，你进去前把你的人盯好，快点行动
Yeah. Stake your men out before you go in. Get a move on.

1163
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:44,209
刚接到消息
News just came in.

1164
01:22:44,334 --> 01:22:48,047
一个巡警在车库执勤时碰到两个人，被他们打伤
A patrolman was on duty at the car barn. He ran into two men and was slugged.

1165
01:22:48,172 --> 01:22:50,883
他们逃跑了，但巡警认出其中的小个子是瑞登施奈德
They got away, but he identified the smaller one as Riedenschneider.

1166
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:53,302
非常好，我们要封锁整片地区
Good. Great. We'll block off the whole area.

1167
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:55,637
别拉警笛，我们要秘密行动
And no sirens. We'll make it a sneak.

1168
01:22:55,762 --> 01:22:58,890
- 那个巡警怎么样？伤得严重吗？　- 他头部受伤，有些虚弱
- How about the patrolman? Badly hurt?  - A head wound and he's kinda punchy,

1169
01:22:59,015 --> 01:23:01,142
但医生认为头骨没有破
but the doctor doesn't think he's got a fracture.

1170
01:23:01,268 --> 01:23:05,272
孩子们，看来这起案件终于有进展了
Well, son, looks like maybe we're getting somewhere at last.

1171
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:08,692
警长，我怎么会知道贝拉提尔珠宝店失窃案的事？
Look, Lieutenant, what-what would I know about Belletier's?

1172
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:10,944
我可不会卷进盗窃案，你知道的
I wouldn't mix in no robbery. You know that.

1173
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:13,071
- 你不会吗？　- 不，当然不会！
- Wouldn't you?  - No, of course not!

1174
01:23:13,197 --> 01:23:16,076
你确实在这里见过瑞登施奈德，但那并不意味着…
You saw Riedenschneider here, sure. But that don't say --

1175
01:23:16,201 --> 01:23:18,535
你这笨蛋，我从未在这里见过任何人
You're nuts. Never seen anybody here.

1176
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:21,371
我怎么可能？在此之前我从未来过这里
How could I? I never been here before this.

1177
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:22,706
噢
Well,

1178
01:23:23,499 --> 01:23:25,209
既然是这样
that being the case,

1179
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:28,379
怎么会把我和贝拉提尔珠宝店失窃案关联在一起？
what's to connect me with the Belletier job?

1180
01:23:28,504 --> 01:23:30,631
有人见过他来到这里，我不知道是谁
Somebody saw him here. I don't know who.

1181
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:32,633
也许你这附近有告密者
Maybe you got a fink around.

1182
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:38,013
警长，你确定不喝杯酒吗？
Look. You're sure you won't have one, Lieutenant?

1183
01:23:38,138 --> 01:23:42,184
不，谢谢，我…执勤时从不喝酒，那是违反规定的
No, thanks, I... never drink while on duty. It's against regulations.

1184
01:23:42,309 --> 01:23:45,979
听着，我没什么可隐瞒的，瑞登施奈德待过这里
Look. I got nothing to hide. Riedenschneider holed up here.

1185
01:23:46,104 --> 01:23:49,191
他破产了，我让他在这里的房间住了两天
He was broke. I let him use a room for a couple days.

1186
01:23:49,316 --> 01:23:53,320
后来我厌倦了他待在这里，给了一些钱把他打发走了
I got tired of having him around. I gave him a few bucks to get rid of him.

1187
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:55,280
- 他去了哪里？　- 我不知道
- Where'd he go?  - I don't know.

1188
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:57,282
我不知道！
I don't know!

1189
01:23:57,783 --> 01:24:00,786
考比，你把我当作哥们儿，是不是？
Look, Cobby, do you figure me for a pal, or don't you?

1190
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:04,623
- 当然了，警长　- 那就接受我的建议，改变立场
- I sure do, Lieutenant.  - Then take my advice and turn state's.

1191
01:24:04,748 --> 01:24:06,875
我们会和局长达成一份小协议
We'll make ourselves a little deal with the commissioner.

1192
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,504
- 你最多被判刑一到两年　- 我是清白的
- You won't get more than a year or two.  - Look, I-I'm clean.

1193
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:12,756
我不知道博士去了哪里，这是真话
I don't know where the doc went. That's the truth.

1194
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:14,800
总部的人不会相信你
They won't believe you at headquarters.

1195
01:24:14,925 --> 01:24:16,927
如果你说你不知道，他们会严格审问你
Every time you'd tell them that, they'd work you over,

1196
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:19,054
相信我，你不是吃苦的料
and you ain't the type that can take it, believe me.

1197
01:24:19,179 --> 01:24:21,432
半小时内你就会吐露一切
You'd spill your guts in half an hour.

1198
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:28,272
饶了我吧
Gi-Give me a break.

1199
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:31,441
你当然是来抓人的，但我不在这里
You came to make a pinch, sure. But I'm not here.

1200
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:34,194
我去夏安市做生意了
I had to go to Cheyenne on business.

1201
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:37,155
不，考比，你就在这里
Uh-uh. You're right here, Cobby.

1202
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:39,908
我一直对你很好，警长
I've always treated you right, Lieutenant.

1203
01:24:40,534 --> 01:24:42,536
帮我脱身
Let me duck out.

1204
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:45,330
- 你可以逃过处罚　- 不，我不能
- You can get away with it.  - No, I couldn't.

1205
01:24:45,455 --> 01:24:47,666
局长发疯了，他要放人血
The commissioner's mad. He's out for blood.

1206
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:49,793
而且不能放我的血
And it's not going to be mine.

1207
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:53,338
你阻止不了我
You're not gonna stop me.

1208
01:24:53,463 --> 01:24:55,883
你必须放我走！你必须这样做！
You're gonna let me go! You're gonna do that!

1209
01:24:56,008 --> 01:24:57,134
否则…
If you don't...

1210
01:24:57,259 --> 01:25:01,096
我知道，否则你会揭发我
Yeah, I know. You'll be a Grade-A pigeon.

1211
01:25:01,221 --> 01:25:02,598
没错
That's right.

1212
01:25:02,723 --> 01:25:04,892
我会揭发你在这里见过瑞登施奈德
I'll tell 'em you saw Riedenschneider here

1213
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:06,852
但你却没赶走他，为什么？
and didn't roust him. Why?

1214
01:25:06,977 --> 01:25:09,480
因为你必须解释你来这里干什么
Because you'd have to explain what you were doing here.

1215
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:11,857
我会揭发你从我这里得到了甜头
I'll tell 'em about the juice you've been getting out of me.

1216
01:25:11,982 --> 01:25:14,318
考比，你现在做的事让我很恼火
Cobby, the only thing you're doing is making me sore.

1217
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:16,528
一旦我打开话匣子，我就不会停
Once I start singing, I won't stop.

1218
01:25:16,653 --> 01:25:19,948
- 他们会把你和我关在一起　- 考比，那你就错了
- They'll jug you right alongside of me.  - That's where you're wrong, Cobby.

1219
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:22,618
就算他们相信你，也不会太为难我
Even if they believe you, it won't go too hard with me.

1220
01:25:22,743 --> 01:25:26,538
因为我将成为破获全国最大盗窃案的人
Because I'll be the guy that cracked the biggest case ever pulled in the country.

1221
01:25:27,289 --> 01:25:30,375
- 考比，这会很疼　- 迪崔克！干嘛？你疯了吗？
- Gonna get hurt, Cobby.  - Ditrich! What, have you gone crazy?

1222
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,085
- 站起来！　- 啊！
- Stand up!  - Aaah!

1223
01:25:48,769 --> 01:25:50,979
考比，我说过你吃不了苦
I told you you couldn't take it, Cobby.

1224
01:25:51,104 --> 01:25:52,855
喝杯酒
Here.

1225
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,529
他们会骂我是告密者
They'll call me a fink.

1226
01:25:59,655 --> 01:26:01,156
这才像话
That's my boy.

1227
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:12,041
既然我最近有很多案子要忙，我想妳应该出去旅行
So, since I'm gonna be busy with a lot of cases, I thought you'd like to take a trip.

1228
01:26:12,166 --> 01:26:13,834
- 去哪里？　- 我不知道
- Where to?  - I don't know.

1229
01:26:13,959 --> 01:26:15,961
美国太平洋沿岸，佛罗里达州，妳想去哪里都行
The coast, Florida. Anywhere you like.

1230
01:26:16,086 --> 01:26:19,048
朗大叔，真的吗？任何地方？你没骗我？
Could I, Uncle Lon? Anywhere? No fooling?

1231
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:22,302
是的，我觉得换个环境对妳有好处
Yes. I think a change of scenery might be good for you.

1232
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:25,763
你在这里等着，我有个非常棒的主意
Wait. You wait right here. I've got the most terrific idea.

1233
01:26:33,522 --> 01:26:36,400
噢，古巴，那是一个不错的主意
Oh. Cuba. There, that's not a bad idea.

1234
01:26:36,525 --> 01:26:40,571
想象一下我在这片沙滩上穿着绿色泳装，妙极了
Imagine me on this beach here in my green bathing suit. Yipe.

1235
01:26:40,696 --> 01:26:43,616
我差点买了一件白色的，但不够新潮
I almost bought a white one, but it wasn't quite extreme enough.

1236
01:26:43,741 --> 01:26:47,829
如果我真要追逐新潮，我会买一件法国式比基尼
If I went in for the extreme extreme, I would have bought a French one.

1237
01:26:47,954 --> 01:26:50,414
逃命吧，姑娘们，性感炸弹来了
Run for your lives, girls. The fleet's in.

1238
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:53,751
朗大叔，我太兴奋了，妙极了！
Oh, Uncle Lon, am I excited. Yipe!

1239
01:26:54,877 --> 01:26:58,797
看呐，这是不是很浪漫？真正的棕榈树、海洋、一切美好事物
Look, Uncle Lon. Isn't it romantic? Real palms and ocean and everything.

1240
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,802
这么晚了会是谁？
Who can that be this time of night?

1241
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:07,681
朗大叔，去看看是谁
See who it is, Uncle Lon.

1242
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:12,436
他们为什么如此用力敲门？
Why are they pounding so?

1243
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:14,814
朗大叔，我害怕
I'm scared, Uncle Lon.

1244
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:24,364
年轻人，你有一只铁拳啊
Well, young man, you've got an iron fist.

1245
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,242
噢，你好，哈迪，进来吧
Oh, hello, Hardy. Come in.

1246
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:37,794
里面有火，进去吧，你们看起来很冷
Well, there's a fire in here. Come on in. You look cold.

1247
01:27:48,305 --> 01:27:50,390
埃默瑞克，我是来逮捕你的
I'm here to arrest you, Emmerich.

1248
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:56,897
我能问为什么吗？
May I ask what for?

1249
01:27:57,522 --> 01:28:00,317
盗窃案和谋杀案的共犯
Complicity. In robbery and in murder.

1250
01:28:01,901 --> 01:28:05,113
哈迪，如果我是你，我会想出更多控诉
If I were you, Hardy, I'd think up a few more charges.

1251
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:07,240
可能会有一项控诉站得住脚
You might make one of them stand up

1252
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:10,994
如果你面对的是愚蠢的陪审团和公正的法官的话
if you get an imbecile jury and the right judge.

1253
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:13,914
- 把年轻女士带来　- 是，长官
- Get the young lady.  - Yes, sir.

1254
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:21,338
你也许想知道，你的朋友考比已经签了认罪书
It may interest you to know that your friend Cobb has signed a confession.

1255
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:24,800
想看看吗？给你
Want to take a look at it? Here.

1256
01:28:34,851 --> 01:28:38,271
小姐，破门而入可没什么风度，但不要逼我
Okay, miss, it's a shame to bust this door in, but here goes.

1257
01:28:38,855 --> 01:28:41,358
大香蕉头，你还没烦够我吗？
Haven't you bothered me enough, you big banana head?

1258
01:28:41,483 --> 01:28:44,694
只要你敢踢破我的门，埃默瑞克先生就会把你扔出房子
Just try breaking my door, and Mr. Emmerich will throw you out the house.

1259
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:48,073
恐怕不会，小姐，他自己的麻烦够多了
'Fraid not, miss. He's got troubles enough.

1260
01:28:48,198 --> 01:28:50,325
事实上，他是一只死鸭子了
As a matter of fact, he's a dead duck.

1261
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:53,161
安德鲁，快点，把年轻女士带过来
Hurry up, Andrews. Bring the young lady in here.

1262
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:56,164
我必须和他说话吗？
Do I have to talk to him?

1263
01:28:57,374 --> 01:28:59,626
我不能只和你说话吗？
Couldn't I just talk to you?

1264
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:02,588
来吧，宝贝
Come on, baby.

1265
01:29:02,713 --> 01:29:04,631
克服一下
Get it over with.

1266
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:07,217
还有…放聪明点
And... be smart.

1267
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:10,971
告诉局长真相，只要这样做就行
Tell the commissioner the truth. That's the only thing to do.

1268
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:13,640
来吧
Come on.

1269
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:23,817
坐下
Sit down.

1270
01:29:23,942 --> 01:29:27,654
安德鲁，复述一下芬利小姐昨天下午录的口供
Andrews, repeat the statement Miss Phinlay made yesterday afternoon.

1271
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:30,198
她说上周五晚上从十一点半到凌晨三点
She said Mr. Emmerich was in this house with her

1272
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:33,744
埃默瑞克先生和她一起在这栋房子里
from 11:30 PM to 3:00 AM last Friday night.

1273
01:29:33,869 --> 01:29:35,787
这就是妳的口供吗？
Is that the statement you made?

1274
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:38,623
- 对，先生　- 那是真的吗？
- Yes, sir.  - Was it the truth?

1275
01:29:44,713 --> 01:29:47,883
年轻女士，妳回答前思考清楚，除非妳想去坐牢
You better think before you answer, young lady, unless you wanna go to jail.

1276
01:29:48,008 --> 01:29:49,217
坐牢？
Jail?

1277
01:29:49,342 --> 01:29:53,346
为了包庇罪犯而提供虚假的不在场证明，那就要坐牢
For setting up a false alibi to keep another from being punished for a crime.

1278
01:29:54,556 --> 01:29:57,559
- 埃默瑞克先生不会犯罪　- 他会犯罪而且已经做了
- Mr. Emmerich wouldn't commit a crime.  - He would and did.

1279
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:04,858
- 告诉他真相　- 朗大叔
- Tell him the truth.  - Uncle Lon.

1280
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:08,820
这是妳唯一能做的事，除非妳想因妨碍司法而被起诉
It's the only thing to do, unless you want to be indicted for obstructing justice.

1281
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:10,947
我昨天说的…
What I said yesterday was...

1282
01:30:12,282 --> 01:30:15,744
并非完全…我的意思是…
Well, it wasn't exactly... I mean...

1283
01:30:16,495 --> 01:30:18,497
- 那不是…　- 是事实吗？
- It wasn't really the...  - Was it the truth?

1284
01:30:19,748 --> 01:30:20,958
不是，先生
No, sir.

1285
01:30:21,083 --> 01:30:23,293
- 妳没有和埃默瑞克在一起，对吗？　- 对，先生
- You weren't with Emmerich, were you?  - No, sir.

1286
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:26,838
- 妳在别的地方，而且没和他在一起　- 对，先生
- You were someplace else and you were not with him.  - Yes, sir.

1287
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:30,133
是他告诉妳该说什么，让妳记在心里
He told you what to say, made you learn it by heart.

1288
01:30:31,718 --> 01:30:34,054
- 回答我　- 不
- Answer me.  - No.

1289
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:36,014
我的意思是，对，先生
I mean, yes, sir.

1290
01:30:36,139 --> 01:30:39,268
我的意思是，我记在心里！
I mean, I learned it by heart!

1291
01:30:39,393 --> 01:30:42,479
- 给她重新录口供，让她在上面签字　- 是，长官
- Get a new statement from her. Have her sign it.  - Yes, sir.

1292
01:30:42,604 --> 01:30:44,606
年轻女士，这次我要全部的真相
This time, young lady, I want the whole truth.

1293
01:30:45,565 --> 01:30:47,567
小姐，到这边来
Over here, miss.

1294
01:30:52,739 --> 01:30:54,574
朗大叔，对不起
I'm sorry, Uncle Lon.

1295
01:30:55,408 --> 01:30:57,452
我尽力了
I tried.

1296
01:30:57,577 --> 01:30:59,996
对妳而言，已经做得很好了
You did pretty well, considering.

1297
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:06,753
朗大叔，我的旅行怎么办？我还能去吗？
What about my trip, Uncle Lon? Is it still on?

1298
01:31:07,754 --> 01:31:10,090
宝贝，别担心，妳会有很多旅行的
Don't worry, baby. You'll have plenty of trips.

1299
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:17,055
埃默瑞克，看来一切都结束了
Seems to be all wrapped up, Emmerich.

1300
01:31:20,184 --> 01:31:21,977
还给你
Oh, here.

1301
01:31:22,102 --> 01:31:25,647
如果你不介意，我想打电话给我的妻子
Say, I'd like to, uh, telephone my wife, if you don't mind.

1302
01:31:25,772 --> 01:31:28,775
- 太晚了，她可能会担心　- 你请便
- Getting late. She might be worried.  - Help yourself.

1303
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:31,903
但别想逃跑，你逃不远的
But don't try to run. You won't get very far.

1304
01:32:07,527 --> 01:32:13,533
（亲爱的梅，请原谅我…
我无法面对我所对妳做的事，我…）

1305
01:32:29,711 --> 01:32:31,713
埃默瑞克！
Emmerich!

1306
01:32:56,154 --> 01:32:59,366
- 等等！住手！救命！　- 过来！
- Wait! Stop! Look out!  - Come on!

1307
01:32:59,492 --> 01:33:00,826
- 你等着瞧！　- 松手！
- You wait and see!  - Break loose!

1308
01:33:00,951 --> 01:33:02,786
你等着瞧，肮脏的告密者！
You wait and see, you dirty fink!

1309
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:04,829
你会和你的哥们儿埃默瑞克落得同样下场！
You're gonna wind up where your pal Emmerich is!

1310
01:33:04,954 --> 01:33:08,333
你会躺进停尸房！你等着瞧，肮脏的告密者！
You're gonna wind up in the morgue! You wait and see, you dirty fink!

1311
01:33:08,458 --> 01:33:11,711
- 关他进去！　- 告密者！该死的告密者！
- Haul him in!  - Fink! Fink! Fink!

1312
01:33:16,674 --> 01:33:18,676
去守住防火通道
Fire escape.

1313
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:28,478
我们找路易·查维利
We're looking for Louis Ciavelli.

1314
01:33:32,649 --> 01:33:34,609
[ 玛利亚说意大利语祈祷 ]
[ Maria praying in Italian ]

1315
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:37,946
如果你们不坚持进来的话，我会很感激
I'd consider it a great favor if you didn't insist on going in.

1316
01:33:38,071 --> 01:33:41,241
查维利夫人正在…我不说你们也看得出来
Mrs. Ciavelli is... Well, I don't have to tell you.

1317
01:33:41,366 --> 01:33:43,994
威廉，如果神父说可以，那就可以
If the father says it's okay, Williams, it's okay.

1318
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:45,912
- 给局长办公室打电话　- 是，长官
- Call the commissioner's office.  - Yes, sir.

1319
01:33:46,037 --> 01:33:49,040
局长认识我，提我的名字，索提诺
The commissioner knows me. Mention my name. Sortino.

1320
01:33:49,166 --> 01:33:50,417
谢谢你，神父
Thank you, Father.

1321
01:33:50,584 --> 01:33:53,504
（埃默瑞克律师开枪自杀）
「埃默瑞克毕业于州立法律大学」
"Emmerich was a graduate of the law college of State University

1322
01:33:53,629 --> 01:33:56,381
「并在这里工作超过二十五年」
and had practiced here for over 25 years."

1323
01:33:56,506 --> 01:33:58,466
多么愚蠢，难以置信
What foolishness. Unbelievable.

1324
01:33:58,591 --> 01:34:02,095
- 他最多被判刑两年　- 他甚至背叛了他自己
- He wouldn't have gotten more than two years.  - He even double-crossed himself.

1325
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:06,224
- 博士，你的头怎么样？　- 完好如初，没什么事
- How's your head, Doc?  - Good as it ever was, which isn't saying much.

1326
01:34:06,349 --> 01:34:09,602
到处都在传播你的照片，出城对你来说并不容易
Getting out of town won't be a cinch for you with your picture spread around.

1327
01:34:09,728 --> 01:34:12,022
我会出去的，没问题
Oh, I'll get out, all right.

1328
01:34:12,147 --> 01:34:14,191
我会打辆出租车到城市郊区
I'll take a taxi to the edge of town

1329
01:34:14,316 --> 01:34:16,401
然后让司机载我去克利夫兰市
and have him drive me as far as Cleveland.

1330
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:19,654
迪克斯，你确定不跟我一起走吗？
Sure you wouldn't come along with me, Dix?

1331
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:21,823
留着吧
Keep it.

1332
01:34:22,449 --> 01:34:23,950
不用了，谢谢
No, thank you.

1333
01:34:24,075 --> 01:34:26,161
如果你不来，你能资助我吗？
If you won't come, will you finance me?

1334
01:34:26,286 --> 01:34:28,872
我手里只有四、五美元了
I haven't got but four or five dollars.

1335
01:34:28,997 --> 01:34:31,124
我当然可以资助你，你需要多少？
Sure, I'll finance you. How much you need?

1336
01:34:31,249 --> 01:34:34,377
我有一千美元就够了，非常感谢
I can get along on a thousand dollars, thanks very much.

1337
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:38,214
剩下的宝石留给你，价值五万美元呢
And you can have the rest of these stones. That's $50,000 worth.

1338
01:34:38,339 --> 01:34:42,260
我拿着宝石有什么用？难道我会走进当铺卖掉它们吗？
What would I do? Can you see me walking into a hock shop with that stuff?

1339
01:34:42,385 --> 01:34:45,847
首先他们会认为这是膺品，然后他们就会呼叫防暴警队
First they'd think they were phony, and then they'd yell for the riot squad.

1340
01:34:45,972 --> 01:34:48,933
不，博士，我可以给你一千块钱，但不用给我宝石
No, Doc, you can have the thousand, but no rocks for me.

1341
01:34:49,058 --> 01:34:51,477
好吧，谢谢你，迪克斯
Well, thank you, Dix.

1342
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:57,316
告诉我写信到哪里，至少我可以把五千块钱尾款寄给你
Tell me where to write you. At least I can send you the five grand you got coming.

1343
01:34:57,441 --> 01:34:59,944
- 你在肯塔基州的地址是什么？　- 算了
- What will your address be in Kentucky?  - Forget it.

1344
01:35:00,069 --> 01:35:01,905
也许我还会见到你
Maybe I'll see you around.

1345
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:03,323
好吧…
Well...

1346
01:35:05,325 --> 01:35:07,327
- 那么再见了　- 再见，博士
- Good-bye then.  - Good-bye, Doc.

1347
01:35:08,662 --> 01:35:10,622
等等，你还没有武器
Hey, wait a minute. You haven't got a heater.

1348
01:35:10,747 --> 01:35:13,166
你可以拿我的，但是…朵儿，妳有枪吗？
I'd let you have mine, but... You got a gun, Doll?

1349
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:16,336
没有，迪克斯，我以前有一支，但我猜有人把它偷走了
No, Dix. I used to have one around, but I guess somebody stole it.

1350
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:20,007
我不想要枪，自从二十岁起我就不带枪了
I don't want a gun. Thank you. I haven't carried a gun since my 20s.

1351
01:35:20,132 --> 01:35:23,718
你带着枪，你就会射杀警察，这是坏习惯，很难改变
You carry a gun, you shoot a policeman. Bad rap, hard to beat.

1352
01:35:23,843 --> 01:35:26,679
你不带枪，警察拿枪指着你时，你干脆投降
You don't carry a gun, you give up when they hold one on you.

1353
01:35:26,804 --> 01:35:28,806
好吧，博士，你最了解
All right, Doc. You know best.

1354
01:35:44,197 --> 01:35:46,366
亲爱的，来杯咖啡如何？
How about a cup of coffee, honey?

1355
01:35:46,491 --> 01:35:50,995
这个德国小老头真有趣，我完全搞不懂他
That squarehead. He's a funny little guy. I don't get him at all.

1356
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:54,123
也许因为他是外国人，思维方式和我们不一样
Maybe it's because he's a foreigner. They just don't think like us.

1357
01:35:54,249 --> 01:35:56,918
我也必须在天亮之前离开城市
I gotta get out of town too and before morning.

1358
01:35:57,919 --> 01:36:00,171
总之，他有足够的胆量
Anyway, he's got plenty of guts.

1359
01:36:01,381 --> 01:36:04,259
- 亲爱的，来杯咖啡如何？　- 要么快弄，要么闭嘴
- How about a cup of coffee, honey?  - Make it or shut up about it.

1360
01:36:04,384 --> 01:36:06,427
- 伤口裂开了　- 聪明姑娘
- It's that wound.  - Bright girl.

1361
01:36:06,552 --> 01:36:09,764
迪克斯，伤口又开始流血了，我有止疼药
Dix, it's starting to bleed again. I know, aspirin.

1362
01:36:24,487 --> 01:36:26,656
皮克林大道和中央大街
Pickering Avenue and Center Street.

1363
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:29,325
- 你知道在哪里吗？　- 城市的另一头
- You know where that is?  - Other side of town.

1364
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:31,578
- 有多远？　- 我能在一小时内赶过去
- How far is that?  - I can make it in an hour.

1365
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:33,663
很好，我有亲戚住在那里
Okay. I got relatives living there.

1366
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:35,999
我要换乘火车，没事可做
I'm between trains and I got nothing else to do.

1367
01:36:36,124 --> 01:36:38,502
我了解，我在城市两头都有亲戚
I know how it is. I got relatives myself,

1368
01:36:38,627 --> 01:36:41,963
（弗兰克·舒尔茨 [ 德国姓氏 ] ）
总写信找我要钱
on both sides. Always writing me letters for money.

1369
01:36:42,088 --> 01:36:45,133
[ 双方说德语 ]
[ Speaking German ]

1370
01:36:45,258 --> 01:36:47,468
我很久没讲德语了
I haven't spoken German for a long, long time.

1371
01:36:47,593 --> 01:36:49,971
- 你有慕尼黑口音　<i>- [ 德语 ] 当然，</i>我出生于慕尼黑
- You have a München accent.  <i>- Natürlich.</i> I was born there.

1372
01:36:50,096 --> 01:36:52,265
但你知道人们怎么说的：「有钱的地方就是家」
But you know what they say. "Home is where the money is."

1373
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:53,433
<i>[ 德语 ] 对</i>
<i>Ja.</i>

1374
01:36:53,558 --> 01:36:55,935
弗朗茨，你愿意载我去克利夫兰市吗？
Franz, how would you like to drive me to Cleveland?

1375
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:57,562
那是很远的路，朋友
It's a long way, my friend.

1376
01:36:57,687 --> 01:37:00,148
但还是比明早坐火车要快吧
But it would be quicker than to take the train tomorrow morning.

1377
01:37:00,273 --> 01:37:02,483
- 那你亲戚怎么办？　- 忘掉他们吧
- What about your relatives?  - Ah, forget them.

1378
01:37:03,192 --> 01:37:05,653
我不知道，克利夫兰市非常远
Well, I don't know. Cleveland. That's a long way.

1379
01:37:06,321 --> 01:37:09,950
- 要花很多钱　- 先给你五十美元小费，你说如何？
- Costs a lot of money.  - There's a $50 tip for you. What do you say?

1380
01:37:10,075 --> 01:37:13,078
为了五十美元，我愿意载你去北极
For $50, I'd drive you to the North Pole.

1381
01:37:13,244 --> 01:37:15,371
如果我们要去克利夫兰市，最好加满油
Well, we better get gas if we're going to Cleveland.

1382
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:19,250
我们出城后再停车，然后我们就能一次性把事情做完
Let's not stop till we get out of town. Then we can do everything at once.

1383
01:37:19,375 --> 01:37:22,170
吃晚餐，喝啤酒，抽雪茄，舒服地休息一下
Have a little meal, beer, a cigar and go in comfort.

1384
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:24,672
看来你是一个很懂得享乐的人
I can see you're a man who likes his pleasures.

1385
01:37:24,797 --> 01:37:27,341
弗朗茨，我问你，生命中除了享乐还能干嘛？
Well, Franz, what else is there in life, I ask you?

1386
01:37:29,427 --> 01:37:30,928
<i>[ 德语 ] 请</i>
<i>Bitte.</i>

1387
01:37:38,395 --> 01:37:40,188
妳已经出去了两小时，发生了什么？
You've been gone nearly two hours. What happened?

1388
01:37:40,313 --> 01:37:42,607
很花时间，我被巡逻警车拦住两次
It took time. I was stopped twice. Prowl cars.

1389
01:37:42,732 --> 01:37:44,901
附近都是臭警察，你无法想象…
The neighborhood's crawling with coppers. You can't imagine --

1390
01:37:45,026 --> 01:37:46,986
- 妳弄到车了吗？　- 是的
- All right. Did you get a car?  - Yes.

1391
01:37:47,111 --> 01:37:50,823
这是零钱，只花了四百美元，我从大维维安那里买的
Here's the change. It only came to $400. I got it from Big Vivian.

1392
01:37:50,948 --> 01:37:53,117
车况还很好，除了刹车片需要更换…
It's in good shape, except the brakes need relining --

1393
01:37:53,242 --> 01:37:54,869
- 妳加油了吗？　- 加了
- Did you put gas in it?  - Yes.

1394
01:37:54,994 --> 01:37:56,621
- 停在哪里？　- 三个街区外
- Where'd you park it?  - Three blocks away.

1395
01:37:56,746 --> 01:37:58,164
- 做得好　- 迪克斯
- Good girl.  - Dix.

1396
01:37:58,289 --> 01:38:00,416
- 什么事？　- 我很害怕
- Yeah?  - I'm-I'm scared.

1397
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:03,502
- 外面都是警察　- 我一点也不担心他们
- All those cops out there.  - They don't worry me one little bit.

1398
01:38:03,628 --> 01:38:05,922
我会慢慢驾驶，沿着主大道一直开
I'll drive slow. Head right down the main boulevard,

1399
01:38:06,047 --> 01:38:08,549
十小时之后，我就会回到老家
and in 10 hours, I'll be home.

1400
01:38:08,674 --> 01:38:11,177
- 亲爱的，你如何驾驶那么长的路？　- 我可以做到
- Dix, honey, how you gonna drive all that way?  - I'll make it.

1401
01:38:11,302 --> 01:38:14,180
不行，你现在的状态根本不行
No. Not in the shape you're in. Not in a million years.

1402
01:38:14,305 --> 01:38:16,307
- 我可以做到　- 迪克斯
- I'll make it.  - Dix.

1403
01:38:17,683 --> 01:38:19,435
让我跟你一起走吧？
Let me go with you?

1404
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:21,396
- 迪克斯，求你了　- 妳疯了吗？
- Please, Dix. Please.  - Are you crazy?

1405
01:38:21,521 --> 01:38:23,481
我在逃亡，我正被重金悬赏
I'm on the lam. I'm wanted bad, packing heat.

1406
01:38:23,606 --> 01:38:25,942
- 妳跟着能做什么？　- 我可以开车
- What good would you be?  - I could drive.

1407
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:30,113
不行，朵儿，我犯的是谋杀案，妳知道那是什么意思
No, Doll. I'm wanted on a killing rap. You know what that means.

1408
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:32,407
我不在乎，我只想和你在一起
I don't care. I want to be with you.

1409
01:38:34,951 --> 01:38:37,203
你不能丢下我走，我不让你走
You can't go without me. I won't let you.

1410
01:38:38,204 --> 01:38:40,206
我不告诉你车在哪里
I won't tell you where the car is.

1411
01:38:45,461 --> 01:38:46,963
我不明白
I don't get it.

1412
01:38:47,839 --> 01:38:49,674
我真不明白
I just don't get it.

1413
01:38:51,426 --> 01:38:53,261
好吧，收拾妳的东西
All right. Get your things packed.

1414
01:39:20,497 --> 01:39:21,998
我们再多点播几张唱片
Come on. Let's play some more.

1415
01:39:22,123 --> 01:39:24,333
珍妮，我没有硬币了，瑞德，你呢？
I'm fresh out of nickels, Jeannie. How about you, Red?

1416
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:26,711
- 我一直没有　- 去弄些来
- I'm always fresh out.  - Well, get some.

1417
01:39:26,836 --> 01:39:29,005
妳挺能花男生钱的
You know, you can cost a guy a lot of dough.

1418
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:32,091
他花个硬币还抱怨，真小气
Nickels he's complaining about. What a spender.

1419
01:39:32,216 --> 01:39:34,594
当然，他想要约会，他总是想要约会
Sure, he wants a date. He always wants a date.

1420
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:37,221
而我们去哪里？去看放过三遍的电影
And where do we go? To a third-run movie.

1421
01:39:37,346 --> 01:39:39,515
然后开车兜风，再爆掉两个轮胎
Then we take a ride and blow two tires.

1422
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:42,101
接着我们来到这里，你为我点了什么？可乐
Then we come here, and what do you treat me to? Cokes.

1423
01:39:42,226 --> 01:39:43,727
我甚至无法听唱片
I can't even listen to records.

1424
01:39:43,853 --> 01:39:45,271
- 这是给你的　- 谢谢
- That's for you.  - Thanks.

1425
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:48,316
- 请你把这些钱换成硬币　- 当然
- Would you have change for this in nickels, please?  - Sure thing.

1426
01:39:48,441 --> 01:39:51,069
你至少应该弄到足够的硬币来为我点播音乐
At least dig down for enough to play me some music.

1427
01:39:51,194 --> 01:39:53,029
嗷，珍妮，别说了
Aw, Jeannie, cut it out.

1428
01:39:53,154 --> 01:39:54,989
小伙子们，打扰一下
Excuse me, boys.

1429
01:39:55,114 --> 01:39:57,200
年轻女士，我也喜欢音乐
Young lady, I like music too.

1430
01:39:59,410 --> 01:40:02,371
- 妳可以为我点播一首吗？　- 当然，你想听什么？
- Would you play me a tune?  - Sure. What do you want me to play?

1431
01:40:02,497 --> 01:40:04,707
- 妳随便点　- 天啊，你这里有多少硬币？
- You pick 'em.  - Gosh, how many have you got here?

1432
01:40:04,832 --> 01:40:07,835
- 不是很多，点播妳喜欢的任何音乐　- 好的
- Not very many. Play what you like.  - Okay.

1433
01:41:02,598 --> 01:41:04,058
先生
Mister.

1434
01:41:05,226 --> 01:41:07,228
先生，已经很晚了
Mister, it's getting late.

1435
01:41:10,689 --> 01:41:12,525
先生，我们该走了
Mister, we better be moving along.

1436
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:16,153
还有时间，朋友，还有时间
Plenty of time, my friend. Plenty of time.

1437
01:41:21,158 --> 01:41:23,911
先生，去克利夫兰市的路非常远
Look, mister, it's a long way to Cleveland.

1438
01:41:27,915 --> 01:41:30,585
嗯，我猜我们最好现在就走
Well, I suppose we better go now.

1439
01:41:30,710 --> 01:41:32,670
别走，我们还没用完所有硬币
Don't go. We haven't used all the nickels.

1440
01:41:32,795 --> 01:41:35,214
- 妳用吧　- 谢谢，你真是太好了
- You use 'em.  - Thanks. It's sure nice of you.

1441
01:41:35,339 --> 01:41:38,509
- 不值一提　- 再见，谢谢，非常感谢
- Don't mention it.  - Good-bye, and thanks. Thanks ever so much.

1442
01:41:38,634 --> 01:41:40,511
这是我的荣幸
Pleasure was all mine.

1443
01:42:02,491 --> 01:42:04,326
你们要干什么？
You men want something?

1444
01:42:04,827 --> 01:42:06,579
艾德，你认为呢？
What do you think, Ed?

1445
01:42:06,704 --> 01:42:08,957
可能是头号嫌疑犯
Might be the number one boy.

1446
01:42:09,082 --> 01:42:10,917
- 只是可能　- 这是怎么回事？
- Just might be.  - See, what is this?

1447
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:12,877
- 闭嘴　- 最好搜他的身
- Shut up.  - Better frisk him.

1448
01:42:13,002 --> 01:42:14,921
- 请便　- 举起双手
- Go right ahead.  - Put up your hands.

1449
01:42:15,046 --> 01:42:17,089
你一定是把我和别人弄混了
You must have me mixed up with somebody else.

1450
01:42:17,214 --> 01:42:20,050
我来自克利夫兰市，做进口生意，我名叫克莱珀
I'm from Cleveland. The importing business. My name's Klemper.

1451
01:42:20,175 --> 01:42:22,094
什么也没有，出租车司机，让我看看那外套
Nothing there. Let me see that coat, hackie.

1452
01:42:22,219 --> 01:42:23,971
- 你犯了一个大…　- 闭嘴，别管闲事
- You're making a big --  - Shut up and keep out of this.

1453
01:42:24,096 --> 01:42:27,099
比尔，你最好打电话给城里核实一下
Tell you what, Bill. Better phone the city and check on the description.

1454
01:42:30,519 --> 01:42:33,564
没必要核实了，我会跟城里说我们抓住他了
We don't need a description. I'll tell 'em we got him.

1455
01:42:36,859 --> 01:42:39,445
- 先生，把双手举起来　- 当然
- Okay, mister. Keep those hands up.  - Of course.

1456
01:42:40,029 --> 01:42:42,573
警官，打扰一下，你能告诉我一些事吗？
Excuse me, Officer, but will you tell me something?

1457
01:42:42,698 --> 01:42:45,034
也许吧，脸朝着前方
Maybe. Just keep your face front.

1458
01:42:45,159 --> 01:42:47,078
你们来这里多长时间了？
How long have you been out here?

1459
01:42:47,203 --> 01:42:50,247
- 这问题真有趣　- 它并不重要
- That's a darn funny question.  - It's not important.

1460
01:42:50,372 --> 01:42:53,542
我们通过那扇窗户观察了你两、三分钟
We've been watching you through that window two, three minutes.

1461
01:42:53,667 --> 01:42:57,380
是的，大概正是点播一首唱片的时间
Ah, yes. Say about as long as it takes to play a phonograph record.

1462
01:42:57,505 --> 01:42:59,674
什么意思？你在说什么？
How's that again? What are you talking about?

1463
01:42:59,799 --> 01:43:01,967
- 没什么　- 脸朝着前方
- It doesn't matter.  - Keep your face front.

1464
01:43:02,092 --> 01:43:04,220
我可以抽雪茄吗？
Do you mind if I smoke a cigar?

1465
01:43:04,345 --> 01:43:08,182
老实站在这里，先生，抽雪茄的事稍后再说
Just stand quiet there, mister. We'll talk about smoking a cigar later.

1466
01:43:08,307 --> 01:43:10,351
当然，警官，当然
Certainly, Officer. Certainly.

1467
01:43:12,025 --> 01:43:14,527
（火车轨道，交叉口）

1468
01:43:16,524 --> 01:43:18,442
迪克斯，你现在感觉如何？
How you feeling now, Dix?

1469
01:43:18,567 --> 01:43:21,987
还好，有点冷，往年的这个时候没这么冷
All right. Cold. Didn't used to get cold this time of year.

1470
01:43:25,574 --> 01:43:28,285
亲爱的，你为什么不让我开一会儿呢？
Why don't you let me drive for a while, honey.

1471
01:43:28,410 --> 01:43:31,913
妳不认识路，我不想总给妳指路
You don't know the way. I'd only have to keep telling you.

1472
01:43:33,165 --> 01:43:34,875
还很远…
Much longer, Di --

1473
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,086
迪克斯？迪克斯？
Dix? Dix?

1474
01:43:37,670 --> 01:43:38,879
迪克斯
Dix.

1475
01:43:50,349 --> 01:43:52,727
迪克斯
Dix.

1476
01:43:52,852 --> 01:43:54,937
不，迪克斯
No, Dix. Dix.

1477
01:44:07,408 --> 01:44:10,870
先生，先生，先生！
Mister. Mister. Mister!

1478
01:44:12,455 --> 01:44:14,624
先生，请帮帮我，我要找医生
Mister, you gotta help me. I gotta find a doctor.

1479
01:44:14,749 --> 01:44:17,460
- 我丈夫生病了　- 好的，我指给妳看
- My husband, he's sick.  - Come on. I'll show you.

1480
01:44:17,585 --> 01:44:20,379
向前直走，夫人，一直到街区的尽头
Go straight on, ma'am. Down to the end of the block.

1481
01:44:20,504 --> 01:44:24,008
我们可以找到斯旺森大夫，他就住在榆树街附近
We'll get Doc Swanson. He lives right near here on Elm Street.

1482
01:44:42,943 --> 01:44:44,862
我丈夫，他生病晕倒了
My husband, he's sick, fainted.

1483
01:44:44,987 --> 01:44:48,783
扶他进去，我给他做检查，就在旁边这房间
Get him inside where I can look at him. Right in this other room here, please.

1484
01:44:52,787 --> 01:44:54,747
抬到桌上
Up on the table.

1485
01:44:54,872 --> 01:44:56,373
脱掉他的外套
Take his coat off.

1486
01:44:59,919 --> 01:45:01,420
放到椅子上
Put it on the chair.

1487
01:45:21,649 --> 01:45:24,860
他正在出血，他失血过多，发生了什么？
This man's been hemorrhaging. He's lost a lot of blood. What happened?

1488
01:45:24,985 --> 01:45:27,530
他受伤了，在一场车祸中受的伤
He was hurt. He was hurt in an auto accident.

1489
01:45:27,655 --> 01:45:30,491
- 他受伤多长时间？　- 几天了
- How long has this wound been let go?  - A couple of days.

1490
01:45:31,075 --> 01:45:33,828
医生，严重吗？他伤得很严重吗？
Is it bad, Doctor? Is he hurt real bad?

1491
01:45:33,953 --> 01:45:37,039
情况不好
Well, it's not good.

1492
01:45:38,457 --> 01:45:41,335
- 艾金森先生，你胳膊有劲吗？　- 我猜有劲，大夫
- You got a strong arm, Mr. Atkinson?  - Good as any, Doc, I guess.

1493
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:43,587
到这边来，请帮我拿着这个
Come around here and hold this for me, please.

1494
01:45:46,590 --> 01:45:49,301
好的
That's right.

1495
01:45:49,969 --> 01:45:51,470
这就行了
There we are.

1496
01:46:00,354 --> 01:46:03,524
喂，让汤姆接电话，我是斯旺森医生
Hello, uh, let me talk to Tom. This is Dr. Swanson.

1497
01:46:04,233 --> 01:46:06,068
把他叫醒
Wake him up.

1498
01:46:07,570 --> 01:46:10,364
- 我口渴，倒点水给我喝　- 好的，迪克斯
- I'm thirsty. Get me a drink of water.  - Sure, Dix. Sure.

1499
01:46:10,489 --> 01:46:13,075
躺下，甜心，请躺下
Lie down, sweetheart. Please lie down.

1500
01:46:14,785 --> 01:46:16,787
喂，是汤姆治安官吗？听着
Hello, Sheriff? Listen, Tom.

1501
01:46:16,912 --> 01:46:19,790
我这里有一个男人，身上有枪伤，非常严重
I got a man here with a gunshot wound. Pretty bad.

1502
01:46:19,915 --> 01:46:21,750
- 甜心，喝水　- 那是谁？
- Here, sweetheart.  - Who's that?

1503
01:46:22,376 --> 01:46:25,629
我必须带你看医生，迪克斯，我没办法
I had to take you to the doctor's, Dix. I couldn't help it.

1504
01:46:25,754 --> 01:46:28,799
扣住他？没必要，他现在不省人事
Hold him? I don't have to. The man's unconscious.

1505
01:46:29,508 --> 01:46:31,844
不，我不认识他
No, no, no. He's a stranger to me.

1506
01:46:31,969 --> 01:46:35,139
他妻子和他在一起，她说是一场车祸
His wife's with him. She says it was an auto accident.

1507
01:46:36,974 --> 01:46:38,183
迪克斯
Dix.

1508
01:46:41,270 --> 01:46:43,439
迪克斯，迪克斯！
Dix. Dix!

1509
01:46:45,983 --> 01:46:48,527
迪克斯，迪克斯
Dix. Dix. Dix.

1510
01:46:55,618 --> 01:46:58,287
他肯定走不远的
Well, he won't get very far, that's for sure.

1511
01:46:58,412 --> 01:47:01,832
他身体里剩下的血都不够支撑一只小鸡活命
He hasn't got enough blood left in him to keep a chicken alive.

1512
01:47:03,083 --> 01:47:05,628
- 还有问题吗？　- 我不喜欢纠缠在同一个问题上
- Any more questions?  - I don't like to harp on the same point,

1513
01:47:05,753 --> 01:47:08,506
但迪崔克会怎样？如果这个警察部门过去…
but what about Ditrich? If the past of this police department --

1514
01:47:08,631 --> 01:47:10,633
迪崔克在牢房里，他将接受审判
Ditrich's in jail. He'll go to trial.

1515
01:47:10,758 --> 01:47:13,344
他将被十二个他曾为之服务的陪审团公民审判
He'll be tried by 12 citizens for whom he's been working.

1516
01:47:13,469 --> 01:47:15,763
让他们决定该对迪崔克严惩不贷还是从轻发落
Let them show justice or compassion as they see fit.

1517
01:47:15,888 --> 01:47:17,681
局长，那你的裁决是什么？
What would be your verdict, Commissioner?

1518
01:47:17,806 --> 01:47:20,601
我不确定，我完全不确定
I'm not sure. I'm not sure at all.

1519
01:47:20,726 --> 01:47:22,227
我这样说吧
Let me put it this way.

1520
01:47:22,352 --> 01:47:26,356
警察部门有腐败官员，这并不奇怪
It's not anything strange that there are corrupt officers in police departments.

1521
01:47:26,481 --> 01:47:30,319
警察们试图清除的罪恶会感染某些人，但不是所有人
The dirt they're trying to clean up is bound to rub off on some, but not all.

1522
01:47:30,444 --> 01:47:35,199
也许一百个人中有一个败类，但另外九十九个都是正直的人
Maybe one out of 100. The other 99 are honest men trying to do an honest job.

1523
01:47:37,409 --> 01:47:39,578
<i>- 斯考利大街１９３号发生抢劫</i>　- 听听
<i>- Robbery at 193 Scully Avenue.</i>  - Listen.

1524
01:47:39,703 --> 01:47:41,663
<i>各单位注意，发生抢劫…</i>
<i>All units, robbery at 193 --</i>

1525
01:47:41,789 --> 01:47:44,334
<i>两个白人男子，持蓝钢手枪…</i>
<i>...two male Caucasians armed with blue steel --</i>

1526
01:47:44,459 --> 01:47:46,794
我知道你们警务记者整天都听到这些案件
I know you're police reporters and hear this all day long,

1527
01:47:46,919 --> 01:47:49,797
但请用你们的良心去听，而不只是用耳朵
but listen with your conscience, not just your ears.

1528
01:47:49,922 --> 01:47:51,841
<i>戴一顶棕色毡帽…</i>
<i>...wearing a brown felt hat --</i>

1529
01:47:51,966 --> 01:47:54,802
<i>詹姆斯大道２５号发生枪击，女人在尖叫</i>
<i>...a shooting at 25 James Boulevard. Woman screaming.</i>

1530
01:47:54,927 --> 01:47:57,763
<i>１２号警车，詹姆斯大道２５号发生枪击，女人…</i>
<i>Car 1-2, shooting at 2-5 James Boulevard. Woman --</i>

1531
01:47:57,888 --> 01:48:00,850
<i>各单位注意，强火力枪战，在滨河路３２１６号…</i>
<i>All units, strong-arm slugging, 3216 River Drive --</i>

1532
01:48:00,975 --> 01:48:03,352
每一次呼叫，我们都要派出警察支援
We send police assistance to every one of those calls,

1533
01:48:03,477 --> 01:48:06,981
因为它们不只是电台里的代号，它们是求救的声音
because they're not just codes numbers on a radio beam, they're cries for help.

1534
01:48:07,106 --> 01:48:10,609
人们被诈骗、抢劫、谋杀、强奸
People are being cheated, robbed, murdered, raped.

1535
01:48:11,276 --> 01:48:14,697
一年三百六十五天，一天二十四小时，每时每刻都在发生
And that goes on 24 hours a day, every day in the year.

1536
01:48:15,698 --> 01:48:17,825
犯罪活动并不罕见，它们经常发生
And that's not exceptional, that's usual.

1537
01:48:17,950 --> 01:48:20,369
现代世界的每个城市都是这样
It's the same in every city of the modern world.

1538
01:48:20,911 --> 01:48:23,664
但假设我们没有警察，不论好坏
But suppose we had no police force, good or bad.

1539
01:48:23,789 --> 01:48:25,457
假设我们…
Suppose we had...

1540
01:48:28,460 --> 01:48:30,296
只是沉默
just silence.

1541
01:48:30,421 --> 01:48:32,256
没人收听，没人回答
Nobody to listen. Nobody to answer.

1542
01:48:32,381 --> 01:48:35,593
战斗结束，丛林法则获胜
The battle's finished. The jungle wins.

1543
01:48:35,718 --> 01:48:38,846
肉食野兽占据统治地位，各位试想一下
The predatory beasts take over. Think about it.

1544
01:48:41,056 --> 01:48:42,641
先生们
Well, gentlemen,

1545
01:48:43,142 --> 01:48:46,478
三个男人进了监狱，三个男人死了，其中一个是自杀
three men are in jail, three men dead, one by his own hand.

1546
01:48:46,603 --> 01:48:50,691
还有一个男人在逃亡，而且我们相信他伤得很重
One man's a fugitive, and we have reason to believe seriously wounded.

1547
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:53,235
七个男人抓住了六个，这不错
That's six out of seven. Not bad.

1548
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:55,154
我们也会抓住最后一个
We'll get the last one too.

1549
01:48:55,279 --> 01:48:58,407
某种程度上，他是所有人之中最危险的一个
In some ways, he's the most dangerous of them all.

1550
01:48:58,532 --> 01:49:01,410
一个冷酷杀手，一个恶棍
A hardened killer. A hooligan.

1551
01:49:01,535 --> 01:49:04,621
没有人类情感，没有怜悯之心
A man without human feeling or human mercy.

1552
01:49:35,944 --> 01:49:37,446
我告诉妳…
I tell ya...

1553
01:49:37,988 --> 01:49:41,408
那匹黑马是我们在山核桃木农场最好的一匹
the black one's the best we ever had at Hickorywood.

1554
01:49:42,659 --> 01:49:46,997
那匹枣色的马也不错，但…黑色的是上等雄马驹
The bay's all right, but... the black's a real good colt.

1555
01:49:48,499 --> 01:49:51,418
我们最漂亮的马…
Prettiest we have -- goin' --

1556
01:49:51,543 --> 01:49:54,129
那匹马是…爸养过最好的
anything... Pa ever bred.

1557
01:49:55,756 --> 01:50:00,511
最容易养，而且…它总跑在前面…
Easiest thing, yeah, but... he's always... way out front of...

1558
01:50:01,261 --> 01:50:03,263
比其余小马驹都快
the other yearlings.

1559
01:50:04,431 --> 01:50:07,726
它是我所见过…最棒的一匹赛马
He's a stake horse or... I never saw one.

1560
01:50:08,936 --> 01:50:10,437
我真希望…
I sure hope...

1561
01:50:11,730 --> 01:50:13,607
爸没有卖掉它
Pa don't sell him.

1562
01:50:16,276 --> 01:50:20,823
如果爸留住那匹黑色雄马驹，一切都会很好
If Pa just hangs on to that black colt, everything's gonna be all right.

1563
01:50:21,448 --> 01:50:22,950
噢，天呐
Oh, dear God.

1564
01:50:24,243 --> 01:50:27,121
我说过了，我再说一遍
I said it. I'll say it again.

1565
01:50:27,246 --> 01:50:30,374
如果爸留住那匹黑色雄马驹
If Pa just hangs on to that black colt,

1566
01:50:30,958 --> 01:50:33,836
一切…都会很好
everything's... gonna be okay.

1567
01:50:44,346 --> 01:50:45,806
这是什么…

噢，天呐，噢，我的天呐
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
