- I own the joint.
- No gun.

00:03:01,496 --> 00:03:02,758
I'll search the joint.

14
00:03:02,931 --> 00:03:05,729
- You got a warrant?
- Look, why don't you cooperate.

15
00:03:05,901 --> 00:03:08,096
- Get a warrant.
- Take him in.

16
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,170
- On what?
- We'll book him on vag.

17
00:03:10,338 --> 00:03:12,306
All right. Come on, you.

18
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:15,933

That's enough.

31
00:04:16,104 --> 00:04:19,562
Well, do you see the man
who pulled the stickup last night?

32
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:23,177
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

33
00:04:23,345 --> 00:04:25,575
He had a hat on.

34
00:04:25,747 --> 00:04:26,975
Put on your hats.

35
00:04:31,887 --> 00:04:33,354
Well?

36
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,748
He was tall, you say. He had on
a brown suit and a wide-brim hat.

37
00:04:38,927 --> 00:04:41,122
All right. Don't you see him?

38
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:47,765
Well, come on. Is that him?

39
00:04:49,137 --> 00:04:51,469
No, it isn't him.

40
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:03,847
- Okay.
- That's all.

41
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:12,349
Lieutenant Ditrich, commissioner
wants to see you in his office right away.

42
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:28,670
Sit down, lieutenant.

43
00:05:29,611 --> 00:05:31,545
Thank you, sir.

44
00:05:36,685 --> 00:05:40,746
Thirty-nine thefts, 33 burglaries,
18 robberies, seven assaults...

45
00:05:40,922 --> 00:05:44,153
...five morals offenses
in the past 30 days.

46
00:05:44,326 --> 00:05:46,794
Quite a record,
even for the 4th Precinct.

47
00:05:46,962 --> 00:05:50,022
We know the guy who's been pulling
most of the stickups.

48
00:05:50,198 --> 00:05:51,893
Name's Dix Handley.

49
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:56,470
He was in the show-up this morning, but
our witness got cold feet and backed down.

50
00:05:56,638 --> 00:05:59,266
- What can you do?
- Lock up the witness! Scare him worse!

51
00:05:59,441 --> 00:06:01,068
It's your job, knowing what to do.

52
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,774
The only merchants
safe from harm in your precinct...

53
00:06:04,946 --> 00:06:06,914
...are those who take wagers
on the horses.

54
00:06:07,082 --> 00:06:09,414
I wanna know why those
parlors are still operating.

55
00:06:09,584 --> 00:06:11,814
I close them down,
but they open up again.

56
00:06:11,987 --> 00:06:15,616
You don't close them hard enough.
Rip out the phones, smash up the furniture!

57
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,691
People like to bet the horses,
and just because the law says...

58
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,795
I don't want your opinion of the law.

59
00:06:30,372 --> 00:06:33,364
- Is that all, sir?
- No, that's not all.

60
00:06:34,142 --> 00:06:37,600
- Where's Erwin Riedenschneider?
- I'm waiting to hear on that, sir.

61
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:39,371
You don't know where he is, do you?

62
00:06:39,547 --> 00:06:42,072
No, but we ought to get
a word from our stoolies.

63
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,309
It was all dumped in your lap.

64
00:06:44,486 --> 00:06:49,514
He left prison yesterday at 12 noon, took
a train for this city, time of arrival, 3:17.

65
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:52,616
All you had to do was stay with him
for 24 hours.

66
00:06:52,794 --> 00:06:55,820
If he didn't register, lock him up.
What happens?

67
00:06:55,997 --> 00:06:59,558
He loses you five blocks from the depot,
and a dangerous criminal...

68
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:01,201
...is at large in this city.

69
00:07:01,436 --> 00:07:04,030
Two men on that detail
ought to get medals for dumbness.

70
00:07:04,205 --> 00:07:06,571
They were assigned by you.
You should get one too.

71
00:07:08,143 --> 00:07:10,907
Ditrich, I can do three things about you:

72
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:14,071
I can reduce you to patrolman,
send you down to Five Corners.

73
00:07:14,316 --> 00:07:17,251
I can bring you up for trial
on charges of incompetence.

74
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:20,911
Or I can give you one more chance
to make good on your responsibilities.

75
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:23,751
I think that'll be
the greatest punishment of all.

76
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:26,356
Thank you, sir.

77
00:07:37,305 --> 00:07:40,172
There's the number you're looking for,
but it's dark.

78
00:07:40,342 --> 00:07:42,310
You want me to wait?

79
00:07:46,414 --> 00:07:49,440
I wouldn't go parading around
this neighborhood with a suitcase.

80
00:07:49,617 --> 00:07:54,077
Some of these young punks might clip you
just to get a clean shirt.

81
00:08:08,103 --> 00:08:10,128
- Yeah?
- I want to see Cobby.

82
00:08:10,305 --> 00:08:12,273
- Who are you?
- Just say Doc is here...

83
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,431
...and would like to see him.

84
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:30,323
Wait here.
You'd better be on the legit, pal.

85
00:08:50,478 --> 00:08:53,003
Well, where the devil is he?

86
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,309
I'm a busy man.
What do you want?

87
00:08:57,485 --> 00:08:59,009
I just got out today.

88
00:08:59,187 --> 00:09:01,087
Oh, so that's it.

89
00:09:01,256 --> 00:09:03,247
I'm tired of you guys
putting a bite on me.

90
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:05,484
- I'm no bank.
- I got a proposition for you.

91
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,093
All you guys have.

92
00:09:07,262 --> 00:09:11,096
- Maybe you didn't get who I was.
- I ain't never seen you before. What is it?

93
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:15,862
Maybe you've heard of me.
The Professor? Or Herr Doctor, maybe.

94
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:20,138
You mean, you are Riedenschneider?

95
00:09:20,775 --> 00:09:22,743
Well, why didn't you say so?

96
00:09:23,344 --> 00:09:26,677
Come on in, Doc. Come on in.

97
00:09:30,018 --> 00:09:32,486
Sit down, Doc. Sit down.

98
00:09:33,521 --> 00:09:36,581
- Have a drink?
- Nothing to drink.

99
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:40,660
I got out of the habit behind the walls.

100
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:44,364
That's all it is, a habit.

101
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:49,993
Well, here's to the drink habit, the only one
I got that don't get me into trouble.

102
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,834
Well, Doc. What's on your mind?

103
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:57,273
I got a proposition. A big one.

104
00:09:57,445 --> 00:10:00,005
- How big is big?
- Too big for you, Cobby.

105
00:10:00,181 --> 00:10:03,742
Now, wait, Doc. I don't like to brag,
but I'm doing all right.

106
00:10:03,918 --> 00:10:06,819
Making book. I'm in the chips.

107
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:09,857
What kind of proposition is it?

108
00:10:10,024 --> 00:10:12,424
A plan for a caper.
And it's a good one.

109
00:10:12,594 --> 00:10:15,188
I could sell it for $ 100,000
on the open market...

110
00:10:15,363 --> 00:10:17,331
...but that would be
throwing money away.

111
00:10:17,499 --> 00:10:20,059
- I prefer to execute it myself and make...
- How much?

112
00:10:20,235 --> 00:10:21,463
Half a million dollars.

113
00:10:23,004 --> 00:10:25,404
Maybe even more.

114
00:10:26,474 --> 00:10:30,001
I will have to do a little checking,
as the plan is some years old...

115
00:10:30,178 --> 00:10:32,578
...but not much checking. Not much.

116
00:10:32,981 --> 00:10:36,109
I need roughly 50,000 to operate.

117
00:10:39,687 --> 00:10:41,621
Fifty thousand?

118
00:10:42,524 --> 00:10:45,550
- No, no, no. I don't see.
- Of course.

119
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:48,696
<i>I thought maybe Mr. Emmerich...</i>

120
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,989
What do you know about Mr. Emmerich?

121
00:10:51,165 --> 00:10:53,030
Only what I heard in the walls...

122
00:10:53,201 --> 00:10:57,194
...that he has money to invest and that
the way to get to him is through you.

123
00:10:57,372 --> 00:11:01,832
- If my information is not correct...
- Correct, sure. Sure. It's correct.

124
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,411
I just never thought of Mr. Emmerich
in connection with this kind of deal.

125
00:11:06,214 --> 00:11:09,308
Excuse me a minute.
I'll be right back.

126
00:11:39,414 --> 00:11:42,247
- Hello, Dix. What do you want?
- I wanna make a bet.

127
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:45,250
- Well?
- Your man says you got to okay it.

128
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,321
- What are you in for?
- 2300 and some.

129
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:50,980
Okay. Your tab's good for 2500...

130
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:54,890
...but that's the limit. Either pick a winner
or pay me when you get that far.

131
00:11:55,063 --> 00:11:56,462
Don't bone me!

132
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:01,591
- I'm not...
- Did I ever welsh?

133
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:03,862
- Nobody said you did...
- You just boned me.

134
00:12:04,038 --> 00:12:09,066
I'm not asking you any favors.
I'll go get you your 2300 right now.

135
00:12:10,845 --> 00:12:14,440
Now, Dix. Now, Dix, listen.
Will you have a drink? Come on.

136
00:12:14,616 --> 00:12:17,107
Come on. Come back here.
Have a drink, will you?

137
00:12:17,285 --> 00:12:19,082
Can you beat that?

138
00:12:19,253 --> 00:12:22,188
- Where does he come off, blowing a fuse?
- Who is he?

139
00:12:22,357 --> 00:12:24,723
A smalltime hooligan,
who's crazy for horses.

140
00:12:24,892 --> 00:12:28,020
My book beats him and beats him,
he keeps coming back for more.

141
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:29,891
Say, Doc...

142
00:12:30,131 --> 00:12:32,258
...I forgot on account of that big tramp.

143
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:35,834
I spoke to Mr. Emmerich on the phone.
He's gonna meet us later tonight.

144
00:12:36,004 --> 00:12:38,973
He's giving a party at his house in town
for a bunch of swells...

145
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,472
...but he'll be at another address later on.

146
00:12:41,643 --> 00:12:45,511
A man like Emmerich has got
more than one place to hang his hat.

147
00:12:51,753 --> 00:12:56,417
Smart cat. Never does a lick of work,
stays out all night, sleeps all day.

148
00:12:56,591 --> 00:12:59,458
What's a big, dirty cat
doing at an eating joint?

149
00:12:59,627 --> 00:13:02,289
I run over one every time I get a chance.

150
00:13:02,463 --> 00:13:05,489
People feeding cats,
and some kids haven't got enough to eat.

151
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:07,362
You gonna buy that magazine?

152
00:13:07,535 --> 00:13:10,936
Why should I?
I seen all the dames in it already.

153
00:13:11,105 --> 00:13:12,663
Wanna make something of it?

154
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,276
- You're a little off your beat.
- How do you mean, Humpty Dumpty?

155
00:13:16,444 --> 00:13:18,742
I mean, you don't belong around here.

156
00:13:18,913 --> 00:13:22,644
You're just passing through,
only not fast enough.

157
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:25,718
If I ever see you running over a cat,
I'll kick your teeth out.

158
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:30,347
I'd take you apart if you were about
a foot taller and straightened up a little.

159
00:13:37,331 --> 00:13:39,458
Suppose you want your heater back.

160
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:41,761
Well, you ain't gonna get it.
How about that?

161
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:44,598
- Quit kidding, Gus.
- I mean it.

162
00:13:44,806 --> 00:13:47,104
Go on, get sore. Smack me down.

163
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:50,403
- You know I wouldn't do that.
- Look, Dix...

164
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:52,569
...take my advice
and knock off for a while.

165
00:13:52,747 --> 00:13:56,581
The happiness boys are on a rampage.
Headquarters has given them the push.

166
00:13:56,751 --> 00:14:00,209
- I can't afford to knock off.
- Oh, stop worrying. I'll stake you.

167
00:14:00,388 --> 00:14:03,050
- Yeah? I need 2300.
- What?

168
00:14:03,224 --> 00:14:06,887
- Something I just gotta take care of.
- Cobby, maybe?

169
00:14:07,295 --> 00:14:11,322
Well, let him sweat. It'll do him good.
Cobby can spare a few pounds.

170
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:13,330
You can't owe money
to a guy like him...

171
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:16,766
...a little loudmouth who bones you
when he isn't even trying to.

172
00:14:16,938 --> 00:14:18,303
I don't get you, Dix.

173
00:14:18,473 --> 00:14:22,603
I just can't be in Cobby's debt
and keep my self-respect.

174
00:14:23,478 --> 00:14:24,911
All right.

175
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:27,479
I got a grand put away.
You can have that.

176
00:14:27,648 --> 00:14:29,843
Maybe I can dig up 1300 more.

177
00:14:30,017 --> 00:14:32,542
- I guess it's all right to owe me, huh?
- I guess.

178
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,745
Yeah. It's just my luck.

179
00:14:35,923 --> 00:14:38,153
Well, I'll get it tomorrow or bust a gut.

180
00:14:38,326 --> 00:14:41,727
In the meantime, stay away
from the boulevard, especially at night.

181
00:14:41,896 --> 00:14:44,262
By the way, they knocked over
the Club Regal.

182
00:14:44,432 --> 00:14:46,366
- Wasn't that where Doll worked?
- Yeah.

183
00:14:46,534 --> 00:14:48,934
It's coming in bunches, it looks like.

184
00:14:49,237 --> 00:14:51,899
Go home, Dix. Stay home.

185
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:59,873
Don't get your flag at half-mast.
Remember, you still got old Gus.

186
00:15:14,762 --> 00:15:17,560
Thirteen hundred? You must be crazy.

187
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:21,100
For Dix? What do I care
for that hooligan?

188
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:25,897
I'd like to help you out, Gus,
but I got mouths to feed...

189
00:15:26,073 --> 00:15:28,439
...and rent to pay and all that stuff.

190
00:15:32,113 --> 00:15:33,876
<i>Why don't you wise up,
you wise guy?</i>

191
00:15:34,048 --> 00:15:35,811
You're a low-down scum.

192
00:15:35,983 --> 00:15:39,248
A low-down, dirty scum,
to talk to me like that.

193
00:16:12,687 --> 00:16:14,655
Look, Gus.

194
00:16:15,022 --> 00:16:17,456
I guess I can make it, all right.

195
00:16:24,932 --> 00:16:27,560
<i>- Yeah?
- Dix, it's me, Doll.</i>

196
00:16:27,735 --> 00:16:29,396
Doll?

197
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:44,049
Hi, honey.

198
00:16:44,252 --> 00:16:45,947
Come on in.

199
00:16:51,626 --> 00:16:54,993
- Close the door.
- Well, sure, Dix. Sure.

200
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,800
<i>I'm awful sorry to bother you,
honey, but...</i>

201
00:17:18,486 --> 00:17:21,978
Doll, if you're gonna smoke,
you gotta learn to carry matches.

202
00:17:31,465 --> 00:17:33,763
Doll, what are you crying about?

203
00:17:35,503 --> 00:17:36,800
Nothing...

204
00:17:37,638 --> 00:17:39,162
I'm sorry.

205
00:17:40,241 --> 00:17:41,970
I'm sorry, Dix.

206
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:46,671
I don't know what I was thinking about,
bothering you at this time of the night.

207
00:17:46,948 --> 00:17:48,677
I'll just run along.

208
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,910
Gus told me the Club Regal
got knocked over.

209
00:17:52,086 --> 00:17:57,547
Yeah. Can you imagine, raiding the Regal?
The cops must have all gone crazy.

210
00:17:57,992 --> 00:18:00,153
So it's a clip joint. So what?

211
00:18:00,328 --> 00:18:03,229
And it would have to happen
on pay night.

212
00:18:03,731 --> 00:18:06,700
- How about a drink?
- Hey, don't care if I do.

213
00:18:07,835 --> 00:18:10,804
One of my eyelashes is coming off.

214
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:15,739
Were you locked out of your room?

215
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,901
How'd you guess?

216
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:21,110
Here's how.

217
00:18:24,452 --> 00:18:29,719
Dix, if it wouldn't be too much trouble,
could I stay here a couple of days?

218
00:18:34,161 --> 00:18:35,992
Just a day or two.

219
00:18:38,499 --> 00:18:42,094
All right. Stay if you want to,
but don't you go getting any ideas, Doll.

220
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:52,002
Everything is here, from the observed
routine of the personnel...

221
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:54,704
...to the alarm system,
the type of locks on doors...

222
00:18:54,882 --> 00:18:58,010
...the age and condition of the main safe
and so forth, so forth.

223
00:18:58,185 --> 00:19:02,019
Take my word for it, Mr. Emmerich.
This is a ripe plum ready to fall.

224
00:19:02,423 --> 00:19:04,948
My friend, according to the boys,
all takes are easy...

225
00:19:05,126 --> 00:19:08,152
...but as a lawyer, I make lots of money
getting them out of jail.

226
00:19:08,329 --> 00:19:10,729
Please, Mr. Emmerich.
Perhaps you know my reputation.

227
00:19:10,898 --> 00:19:12,627
I've engineered some very big things.

228
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,264
That's a fact, Mr. Emmerich.
Doc here is tops.

229
00:19:15,436 --> 00:19:19,167
Am I to understand you gathered this
information before doing your last stretch?

230
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,831
That is correct.
I was ready to begin operations...

231
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:25,274
...and the cops grabbed me for
an old caper I'd almost forgotten about.

232
00:19:25,446 --> 00:19:27,277
The Adelphia Finance caper.

233
00:19:27,448 --> 00:19:29,439
You took them for 160,000,
didn't you, Doc?

234
00:19:29,617 --> 00:19:30,879
A hundred and fifty-eight.

235
00:19:31,052 --> 00:19:33,452
You really believe
there's a million in this thing?

236
00:19:33,621 --> 00:19:35,816
- Maybe even more.
- You mean by that...

237
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:39,858
...that the take will be worth
half a million to us in actual cash?

238
00:19:40,027 --> 00:19:42,587
You know as well as I do
that in no case will a fence...

239
00:19:42,763 --> 00:19:45,789
...give you more than 50 percent.
- That's right, sir.

240
00:19:45,966 --> 00:19:49,026
- Well, what are your main problems?
- There are three.

241
00:19:49,203 --> 00:19:53,401
Money to operate, personnel
and finally, the disposing of the take.

242
00:19:53,574 --> 00:19:55,201
No trouble about the first, eh?

243
00:19:55,376 --> 00:19:57,173
Wait a minute.
This remains to be seen.

244
00:19:57,344 --> 00:19:59,574
The helpers will be paid off
like housepainters.

245
00:19:59,747 --> 00:20:02,147
They'll be told nothing
about the size of the take.

246
00:20:02,316 --> 00:20:05,149
Sometimes, men get greedy.

247
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,848
- Well, how many helpers do you need?
- Only three.

248
00:20:09,023 --> 00:20:10,251
A box man.

249
00:20:10,424 --> 00:20:14,087
Him, we pay most.
Maybe $25,000.

250
00:20:14,495 --> 00:20:18,158
I got a guy for you. Louis Ciavelli.
Best box man west of Chicago.

251
00:20:18,332 --> 00:20:20,926
Expert mechanic.
Been in some very big capers.

252
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:24,765
From what I hear, he can open a safe
like the back of a watch. Only, he costs.

253
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:28,365
Then we need a topnotch driver,
in case of a rumble.

254
00:20:28,542 --> 00:20:30,806
He should get 10,000.

255
00:20:30,978 --> 00:20:33,742
And finally, sad to say,
we need a hooligan.

256
00:20:33,914 --> 00:20:36,849
Most of these fellas are drug addicts.
They're a no-good lot.

257
00:20:37,017 --> 00:20:40,851
Violence is all they know,
but they are, unfortunately, necessary.

258
00:20:41,021 --> 00:20:44,855
For a more or less reliable man,
I'd say 15,000.

259
00:20:46,193 --> 00:20:49,321
Well, that's 50,000 in all.

260
00:20:49,997 --> 00:20:51,589
How...?

261
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:53,927
How's this take to be handled?

262
00:20:54,101 --> 00:20:56,535
Get in touch with the best fences
in the Midwest...

263
00:20:56,704 --> 00:20:58,968
...and deal with whoever makes
the highest offer.

264
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,472
Maybe no one fence
can handle the whole thing.

265
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:05,037
In that case, we deal with two or three.

266
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:07,474
Half a million, eh?

267
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,311
<i>I...</i>

268
00:21:11,652 --> 00:21:14,485
I'm just thinking.

269
00:21:15,823 --> 00:21:19,224
<i>If I decide to go into this thing, I...</i>

270
00:21:19,793 --> 00:21:21,624
I, myself, I might handle the...

271
00:21:22,062 --> 00:21:24,530
You, a fence, Mr. Emmerich?

272
00:21:24,698 --> 00:21:27,826
Oh, no, no, Cobby. Not exactly.

273
00:21:28,002 --> 00:21:31,631
But your proposition looks pretty good.
I'd like to see the most made of it.

274
00:21:32,573 --> 00:21:36,202
Oh, I suppose a fella should stick
to his own trade...

275
00:21:36,377 --> 00:21:39,835
...but I know some big men that might
not be averse to a deal like this...

276
00:21:40,014 --> 00:21:41,982
...if they're properly approached.

277
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,648
Highly respectable men, I might add.

278
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:49,653
So why don't you let me see what I can do
before you look for a fence.

279
00:21:51,225 --> 00:21:54,456
A few days wouldn't make
much difference to you, I don't suppose.

280
00:21:54,628 --> 00:21:56,528
Might mean a lot more money
for all of us.

281
00:21:56,697 --> 00:22:00,133
Good. There's just one thing.
I dislike to mention it, but...

282
00:22:00,301 --> 00:22:02,929
<i>...I've just come from prison and...
- Well, of course.</i>

283
00:22:03,103 --> 00:22:05,571
Cobby will be glad to advance you
anything you need.

284
00:22:05,739 --> 00:22:09,106
- See that you have a place to stay. Cobby?
- Well, you bet your life.

285
00:22:09,276 --> 00:22:12,803
And I got some fancy phone numbers
for you too, Doc.

286
00:22:17,418 --> 00:22:21,286
What's it like, a man of your taste,
seven years behind the walls?

287
00:22:21,455 --> 00:22:22,945
Not too bad.

288
00:22:23,123 --> 00:22:24,613
It's a matter of temperament.

289
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:28,057
I cause no trouble.
The prison authorities appreciate that.

290
00:22:28,229 --> 00:22:30,789
They made me assistant librarian.

291
00:22:30,965 --> 00:22:33,695
I'm afraid I wouldn't make
a model prisoner.

292
00:22:33,867 --> 00:22:37,997
After this job, it's Mexico for me.
I'll live like a king.

293
00:22:38,172 --> 00:22:39,799
Mexican girls are very pretty.

294
00:22:39,974 --> 00:22:44,411
I'll have nothing to do all day long
but chase them in the sunshine.

295
00:22:45,913 --> 00:22:48,575
- You've been very kind, sir.
- Good night. Good night.

296
00:22:48,749 --> 00:22:50,979
- Mr. Emmerich.
- Cobby.

297
00:23:18,078 --> 00:23:21,013
What's the big idea, standing there
staring at me, Uncle Lon?

298
00:23:21,181 --> 00:23:22,739
Don't call me "Uncle Lon."

299
00:23:23,484 --> 00:23:25,247
I thought you liked it.

300
00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:27,148
Maybe I did.

301
00:23:27,855 --> 00:23:29,618
I don't anymore.

302
00:23:37,698 --> 00:23:40,292
I had the market send over
some salt mackerel for you.

303
00:23:40,467 --> 00:23:42,196
I know how you love it for breakfast.

304
00:23:43,203 --> 00:23:45,398
Some sweet kid.

305
00:23:49,176 --> 00:23:50,666
It's late.

306
00:23:50,844 --> 00:23:53,142
Why don't you go to bed.

307
00:24:15,536 --> 00:24:18,266
Some sweet kid.

308
00:24:41,862 --> 00:24:43,454
Hello, Bob Brannom?

309
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,291
This is Emmerich.

310
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:49,331
No, no. I didn't call you
to get the right time.

311
00:24:49,503 --> 00:24:51,801
Listen, I've got a job for you.

312
00:24:51,972 --> 00:24:54,338
No, no. Nothing like that.

313
00:24:54,608 --> 00:24:56,769
I've got over $ 100,000
standing out on my books.

314
00:24:56,944 --> 00:25:00,402
Come to my office tomorrow, I'll give you
a list of the people that owe me.

315
00:25:00,581 --> 00:25:02,048
No, no, no.

316
00:25:02,216 --> 00:25:04,684
Use the method called for
in each particular case...

317
00:25:04,852 --> 00:25:07,878
...and don't tell me anything about it.
All I want is results.

318
00:25:09,189 --> 00:25:10,656
Easy, boy.

319
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:13,752
Easy, boy. Easy.

320
00:25:16,764 --> 00:25:19,665
Hello. Who?

321
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:21,664
Oh, sure, Gus.

322
00:25:22,069 --> 00:25:24,128
He's still asleep.

323
00:25:24,304 --> 00:25:25,771
What?

324
00:25:27,241 --> 00:25:29,573
Yeah. Yeah, I'll tell him.

325
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:36,176
Honey. Honey, that was Gus.

326
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:39,046
He says you can come over.
He's got something for you.

327
00:25:39,219 --> 00:25:40,584
Okay.

328
00:25:40,754 --> 00:25:42,813
Coffee, honey? I made fresh.

329
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,480
Yeah, yeah.

330
00:25:44,658 --> 00:25:47,092
Hey, you sure were dreaming.

331
00:25:47,428 --> 00:25:48,827
How do you know?

332
00:25:48,996 --> 00:25:51,556
You were talking in your sleep.

333
00:25:51,732 --> 00:25:52,960
What was I saying?

334
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:55,761
It was all jumbled up,
but I heard one word real plain.

335
00:25:55,936 --> 00:25:58,063
You called it out several times.

336
00:25:58,238 --> 00:26:00,069
"Corn cracker."

337
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,798
What's that mean?

338
00:26:01,975 --> 00:26:03,772
Corn cracker.

339
00:26:04,511 --> 00:26:06,502
Corn Cracker was a colt.

340
00:26:06,814 --> 00:26:08,714
Yeah, it would be.

341
00:26:09,249 --> 00:26:13,208
Yeah. He was a tall, black colt.
Yeah, I remember what I was dreaming.

342
00:26:13,754 --> 00:26:16,086
I was up on that colt's back.

343
00:26:16,256 --> 00:26:19,191
My father and my grandfather were there,
watching the fun.

344
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:21,327
That colt was buckjumping
and pitching...

345
00:26:21,495 --> 00:26:24,794
...and tried to scrape me off against
the fence, but I stayed with him.

346
00:26:24,965 --> 00:26:29,095
Then I heard my granddaddy say, "He's
a real Handley, that boy. A real Handley."

347
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:30,827
And I felt proud as you please.

348
00:26:31,004 --> 00:26:33,871
Did that really happen, Dix,
when you were a kid?

349
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:37,135
No. The black colt pitched me
into a fence on the first buck...

350
00:26:37,311 --> 00:26:40,075
...and my old man come over,
prodded me with his boot, said:

351
00:26:40,247 --> 00:26:43,910
"Maybe that'll teach you not to brag
about how good you are on a horse."

352
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:47,080
It's nice to hear you laugh.

353
00:26:47,988 --> 00:26:49,512
You know something?

354
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:53,490
One of my ancestors imported the first
Irish thoroughbred into our county.

355
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,527
- Is that a fact?
- Sure.

356
00:26:56,697 --> 00:26:59,564
Why, our farm was in the family
for generations.

357
00:26:59,733 --> 00:27:05,330
One hundred sixty acres,
30 in bluegrass and the rest in crops.

358
00:27:05,506 --> 00:27:08,168
Fine barn and seven brood mares.

359
00:27:08,342 --> 00:27:11,209
- It sounds wonderful, Dix.
- It was.

360
00:27:11,378 --> 00:27:13,346
And then everything happened at once.

361
00:27:13,514 --> 00:27:16,608
My old man died,
and we lost our corn crop.

362
00:27:16,783 --> 00:27:20,981
That black colt I was telling you about,
he broke his leg and had to be shot.

363
00:27:21,488 --> 00:27:23,683
That was a rotten year.

364
00:27:24,324 --> 00:27:26,258
I'll never forget the day we left.

365
00:27:26,426 --> 00:27:30,226
Me and my brother swore we'd buy
Hickorywood Farm back someday.

366
00:27:30,397 --> 00:27:34,356
Growing up in a place and then
having to leave must be awful.

367
00:27:34,535 --> 00:27:36,196
I never had a proper home.

368
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:39,134
Twelve grand would have swung it,
and I almost made it once.

369
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,602
I had more than $5000 in my pocket...

370
00:27:42,776 --> 00:27:45,404
...and Pampoon was running
in the Suburban.

371
00:27:45,579 --> 00:27:48,810
I figured he couldn't lose.
I put it all on his nose.

372
00:27:49,283 --> 00:27:51,342
He lost by a nose.

373
00:27:51,618 --> 00:27:54,712
Drink your coffee, honey,
before it gets cold.

374
00:27:54,888 --> 00:27:58,119
The way I figure,
my luck's just gotta turn.

375
00:27:58,325 --> 00:28:01,886
One of these days, I'll make a real killing,
then I'm gonna head for home.

376
00:28:02,062 --> 00:28:06,522
First thing I do, I take a bath in the creek
and get this city dirt off me.

377
00:28:11,838 --> 00:28:15,137
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, Dix. Nothing.

378
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:17,841
- I say something wrong?
- No.

379
00:28:18,745 --> 00:28:22,738
But, gee, this place is a mess.
It needs a good cleaning.

380
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:26,250
How can you stand to live like this?

381
00:28:32,893 --> 00:28:34,155
Count it.

382
00:28:37,998 --> 00:28:40,967
- Count it.
- Don't have to pay the whole tab at once.

383
00:28:41,134 --> 00:28:43,227
Go ahead and count it.

384
00:28:43,537 --> 00:28:45,971
Why get sore?
There's no reason to get sore.

385
00:28:46,139 --> 00:28:48,699
You boned me in front of a stranger,
made me look small.

386
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:50,706
I didn't mean it.
I shoot my mouth off.

387
00:28:50,877 --> 00:28:53,368
Maybe I had a slight load on.
You know how it is.

388
00:28:53,547 --> 00:28:54,980
No, I don't know how it is.

389
00:28:55,582 --> 00:28:57,243
Look, Dix...

390
00:28:57,484 --> 00:28:59,111
...I made a mistake.

391
00:28:59,286 --> 00:29:02,585
Don't you ever make a mistake? Sure.

392
00:29:02,756 --> 00:29:05,452
Sure. Here, have a drink.

393
00:29:05,826 --> 00:29:07,384
Here you are.

394
00:29:08,428 --> 00:29:10,453
There you are, Dix.

395
00:29:11,031 --> 00:29:13,898
You gotta play the horses the smart way.
Save your money.

396
00:29:14,067 --> 00:29:18,936
The next time there's a fix,
I'll let you know. It'll be money from home.

397
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:22,865
Excuse me.

398
00:29:24,611 --> 00:29:26,909
Oh, it's the Doc. Come on in, Doc.

399
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,980
Meet a friend of mine, Dix Handley.

400
00:29:29,149 --> 00:29:31,982
This is Doc Riedenschneider.
You heard of him, I guess.

401
00:29:32,152 --> 00:29:33,483
Yeah.

402
00:29:33,654 --> 00:29:36,384
Well, how'd you like the whiskey?
Made in your home state.

403
00:29:36,957 --> 00:29:38,686
Where is that, sir?

404
00:29:38,859 --> 00:29:41,089
Kentucky. Boone County, Kentucky.

405
00:29:41,461 --> 00:29:43,827
- Best water in the U.S.A.
- Is that so?

406
00:29:43,997 --> 00:29:46,522
Yes, the water makes
the whiskey fit to drink.

407
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,395
Well...

408
00:29:49,536 --> 00:29:51,766
...I gotta be going.
I'll see you around, maybe.

409
00:29:51,938 --> 00:29:53,530
So long, Dix.

410
00:29:57,577 --> 00:29:59,010
Big hick.

411
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:01,977
His money's all right,
but I wish he wasn't so touchy.

412
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:04,617
Maybe it's a point of honor with him.
A gambling debt.

413
00:30:04,785 --> 00:30:07,879
Him, that hooligan? Honor?
Don't make me laugh.

414
00:30:08,055 --> 00:30:10,421
- He's a hooligan?
- Yeah, but a smalltimer.

415
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:14,356
He'll stick up cigar stores, gas stations.
And every cent goes to the ponies.

416
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,826
One way or another,
we all work for our vice.

417
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:21,333
What do you say, Doc?
How was your date last night?

418
00:30:21,501 --> 00:30:25,631
The young lady drank too much,
but the evening wasn't a complete loss.

419
00:30:25,806 --> 00:30:29,071
- She talked more than if she'd been sober.
- Yeah? What about?

420
00:30:29,242 --> 00:30:33,406
- Your friend Mr. Emmerich.
- Emmerich? Now, look here, Doc...

421
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,708
There's half a million at stake.
I've gotta know where I stand.

422
00:30:36,883 --> 00:30:39,317
Emmerich must put up
before I can hire a crew.

423
00:30:39,486 --> 00:30:41,215
For him, it's nothing. A dead cinch.

424
00:30:41,388 --> 00:30:44,050
The information she gave me
is that he's broke.

425
00:30:46,993 --> 00:30:48,483
Are you crazy?

426
00:30:48,662 --> 00:30:51,859
I've seen him operate for 20 years.
He handles only the biggest cases.

427
00:30:52,032 --> 00:30:54,557
He's got two houses, four cars,
half a dozen servants...

428
00:30:54,735 --> 00:30:58,193
- And one blond.
- Doc, whose word you gonna take?

429
00:30:58,371 --> 00:31:00,362
Mine or some dimwitted dame?

430
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,939
Yours, naturally.

431
00:31:02,109 --> 00:31:05,772
If he's broke,
I wanna be broke the same way.

432
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,911
Lieutenant! Lieutenant!

433
00:31:17,924 --> 00:31:21,223
That guy you saw in my office,
he's just passing through.

434
00:31:21,394 --> 00:31:24,659
Shut up. I didn't see anybody.
How could I? I wasn't here.

435
00:31:24,831 --> 00:31:27,857
Yeah, that's right. That's right.

436
00:31:28,034 --> 00:31:29,433
<i>- Look...
- Yeah?</i>

437
00:31:29,603 --> 00:31:33,903
I came to tell you
you'll have to stand still for a raid.

438
00:31:34,074 --> 00:31:37,043
- You mean they'll haul me downtown?
- It's a short ride.

439
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:39,041
I thought you were a friend of mine.

440
00:31:39,212 --> 00:31:41,806
Right now I've got one friend: Ditrich.

441
00:31:41,982 --> 00:31:44,746
And Ditrich's out on his ear
if he don't make a showing.

442
00:31:44,918 --> 00:31:48,012
- Why me? Why pick on me?
- Because it's logic.

443
00:31:48,188 --> 00:31:50,088
You're the biggest parlor in my precinct.

444
00:31:50,257 --> 00:31:53,715
The citizens know it, the newspapers
know it and even I know it.

445
00:31:53,894 --> 00:31:58,524
- And Mr. Commissioner knows I know it.
- I just hate to have it happen, that's all.

446
00:31:58,698 --> 00:32:01,792
- I'm as sorry as you are.
- Look, lieutenant...

447
00:32:01,968 --> 00:32:04,198
...I've always given you
plenty of cooperation...

448
00:32:04,371 --> 00:32:07,738
...but you're hitting me
at just the wrong time.

449
00:32:08,675 --> 00:32:10,870
Well, all right.

450
00:32:11,044 --> 00:32:12,636
Close up tight.

451
00:32:12,813 --> 00:32:14,906
Keep the place dark.
Don't answer any phones.

452
00:32:15,081 --> 00:32:16,673
Thanks, lieutenant.

453
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,249
Thanks.

454
00:32:26,493 --> 00:32:27,960
That copper, he recognized me.

455
00:32:28,128 --> 00:32:31,120
- How'd you know he was a copper?
- I can smell one a block off.

456
00:32:31,298 --> 00:32:33,892
Don't worry about Ditrich.
He's on my payroll.

457
00:32:34,067 --> 00:32:35,659
Me and him, we're like that.

458
00:32:35,836 --> 00:32:38,100
Experience taught me
never to trust a policeman.

459
00:32:38,271 --> 00:32:41,297
Just when you think one's all right,
he turns legit.

460
00:32:44,644 --> 00:32:48,011
- A Mr. Brannom is here.
- Oh, yes, show him in.

461
00:32:48,181 --> 00:32:51,412
Pardon me, sir.
Mrs. Emmerich is not feeling well.

462
00:32:51,585 --> 00:32:53,519
Yes, well...

463
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,286
...send for Dr. Houseman.
- I already have, sir.

464
00:32:56,456 --> 00:32:57,718
Good.

465
00:32:57,891 --> 00:32:59,518
<i>Tell her...</i>

466
00:32:59,693 --> 00:33:01,957
Say I'll be up to see her later.

467
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:12,602
Well, what about my debtors?
How many of them came through?

468
00:33:13,673 --> 00:33:16,005
- Not a one.
- What's that?

469
00:33:16,176 --> 00:33:17,734
You want all the excuses?

470
00:33:17,911 --> 00:33:20,471
- I've got some beauts.
- It's as bad as that, eh?

471
00:33:20,647 --> 00:33:22,672
Two or three may come through with a part.

472
00:33:22,849 --> 00:33:25,841
- They promised.
- I don't want promises, I want cash.

473
00:33:26,152 --> 00:33:29,986
Look, my friend, a private detective
can't go around threatening people.

474
00:33:30,156 --> 00:33:33,683
I'd lose my license. Ninety-eight percent
of them you're gonna have to sue.

475
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,885
There's no time for that.

476
00:33:36,296 --> 00:33:38,628
I gotta have money.
I've gotta have it this minute.

477
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:41,596
What is it, girl trouble?

478
00:33:41,768 --> 00:33:44,100
Shut up, Brannom! That's not funny.

479
00:33:44,838 --> 00:33:47,807
How's that?
Nobody tells me to shut up.

480
00:33:52,178 --> 00:33:54,237
Sorry, Bob.

481
00:34:02,889 --> 00:34:04,516
Bob, I...

482
00:34:05,425 --> 00:34:07,222
I'm broke.

483
00:34:07,661 --> 00:34:09,754
There. That's the plain, simple fact.

484
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:12,228
I'm finished. I'm bankrupt.

485
00:34:13,033 --> 00:34:16,469
- How could you let Angela take you?
- It's not Angela.

486
00:34:16,636 --> 00:34:19,127
It's everything. It's my whole way of life.

487
00:34:19,306 --> 00:34:24,300
Every time I turn around, it costs thousands
of dollars. 10,000 here, 10,000 there.

488
00:34:24,678 --> 00:34:27,738
I gotta... I gotta get out.

489
00:34:27,914 --> 00:34:30,405
I gotta get out from under.

490
00:34:32,552 --> 00:34:35,521
And the irony of it is
that I've got an opportunity...

491
00:34:35,689 --> 00:34:37,680
...and I can't take it.
- Tough.

492
00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:41,326
Bob...

493
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,894
...I'm gonna hand you
the shock of a lifetime.

494
00:34:51,338 --> 00:34:53,602
Did you ever hear of
Doc Riedenschneider?

495
00:34:53,773 --> 00:34:55,536
Sure. Behind the walls, isn't he?

496
00:34:55,709 --> 00:34:59,167
No, he's out. He got out last week.
Cobby brought him to me.

497
00:34:59,346 --> 00:35:02,042
He's got a plan, beautifully worked out...

498
00:35:02,215 --> 00:35:05,446
...for the biggest caper ever to be pulled
in the Middle West.

499
00:35:05,618 --> 00:35:08,485
Only, he wants $50,000 backing.

500
00:35:08,655 --> 00:35:10,452
Who would be taken?

501
00:35:11,558 --> 00:35:13,583
Belletier's.

502
00:35:14,661 --> 00:35:18,427
The rocks alone would be worth,
conservatively speaking, half a million.

503
00:35:18,598 --> 00:35:21,567
- How much would you get out of it?
- A third of the take.

504
00:35:22,102 --> 00:35:24,502
Brother. You're knocking me out.

505
00:35:25,705 --> 00:35:29,436
What if I were to tell you that I've got
a plan worked out to get it all?

506
00:35:31,911 --> 00:35:34,971
I could tell them that I'd fence
the stuff myself, you see?

507
00:35:35,148 --> 00:35:37,981
Promise them cash on delivery.

508
00:35:38,518 --> 00:35:39,985
Then...

509
00:35:40,987 --> 00:35:43,979
...when the time comes,
I simply wouldn't have the cash.

510
00:35:44,157 --> 00:35:46,853
I'd tell them it'd take
a few days more to raise it.

511
00:35:48,728 --> 00:35:52,755
I'm certain I could get them to leave
the stuff with me while we're waiting.

512
00:35:52,932 --> 00:35:55,162
- Go on.
- Well, then I'd disappear.

513
00:35:55,335 --> 00:35:58,304
I'd take a plane to another country,
to another life.

514
00:35:59,005 --> 00:36:02,532
The gold and platinum I could melt up
and sell as bullion, you see.

515
00:36:02,709 --> 00:36:05,576
And the rocks, sell them one at a time.

516
00:36:05,745 --> 00:36:07,406
There'd be no hurry.

517
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,104
They'd last a lifetime.

518
00:36:11,117 --> 00:36:12,982
How wrong can a guy be?

519
00:36:13,153 --> 00:36:15,018
Here I was worrying about your nerves...

520
00:36:15,188 --> 00:36:17,986
...and you were dreaming up
a double-cross like this.

521
00:36:18,725 --> 00:36:20,192
Yes.

522
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:24,194
But I can't do it,
because I haven't got $50,000.

523
00:36:24,364 --> 00:36:25,991
I can tell you how to raise it.

524
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:29,260
You? How?

525
00:36:29,736 --> 00:36:33,536
- What's in it for me?
- Fifty-fifty.

526
00:36:33,706 --> 00:36:35,105
Okay.

527
00:36:35,275 --> 00:36:38,005
But we may get ourselves killed,
my friend.

528
00:36:39,813 --> 00:36:42,304
Yes, I know.

529
00:36:42,682 --> 00:36:46,550
- Well, how do we raise the money?
- Simple. Cobby.

530
00:36:47,353 --> 00:36:48,786
- Cobby.
- Believe me.

531
00:36:48,955 --> 00:36:51,185
He can dig it up without half-trying.

532
00:36:51,357 --> 00:36:53,018
Yes.

533
00:36:53,193 --> 00:36:55,718
But what do we tell him?
Why do I need money?

534
00:36:55,962 --> 00:36:59,193
Leave it to me. Cobby wants to feel big.

535
00:36:59,365 --> 00:37:00,889
Here's his chance.

536
00:37:01,067 --> 00:37:03,535
Advancing money
for the great Alonzo P. Emmerich.

537
00:37:04,604 --> 00:37:06,128
He'll do it.

538
00:37:06,306 --> 00:37:08,706
He'll sweat, but he'll do it.

539
00:37:10,276 --> 00:37:11,743
What boxes have you opened?

540
00:37:11,911 --> 00:37:15,847
Cannonball, double door,
even a few fire chests. All of them.

541
00:37:16,015 --> 00:37:19,178
- Can you open a vault with a time lock?
- Sure.

542
00:37:19,352 --> 00:37:21,445
- What do you use, lock or seam?
- Seam.

543
00:37:21,621 --> 00:37:22,849
Ever taken one?

544
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:26,583
- Remember the Shafter job?
- Yes, I heard about it behind the walls.

545
00:37:26,759 --> 00:37:28,727
It was a good score.

546
00:37:28,995 --> 00:37:31,555
- Who supplies your soup?
- I thrash it myself.

547
00:37:31,731 --> 00:37:35,258
- How are you as a picklock?
- I can open anything in four minutes.

548
00:37:35,435 --> 00:37:37,562
- He'll do.
- You're in.

549
00:37:37,737 --> 00:37:40,467
Not so fast. What's the cut?

550
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,609
No cut. You get a flat guarantee.

551
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:46,936
<i>- I want 30,000.
- 30,000? Now, Louis...</i>

552
00:37:47,113 --> 00:37:48,978
Twenty-five is what we figured.

553
00:37:49,149 --> 00:37:50,810
- All right, 15 down.
- Ten down.

554
00:37:50,984 --> 00:37:53,509
Fifteen is satisfactory, I think.

555
00:37:53,786 --> 00:37:55,754
There's your paymaster.

556
00:38:11,271 --> 00:38:12,670
What are you sweating for?

557
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:15,933
Money makes me sweat, that's all.
It's the way I am.

558
00:38:20,046 --> 00:38:22,810
- Who are the others on this job, Doc?
- Haven't got them yet.

559
00:38:22,982 --> 00:38:25,951
There's only one driver,
as far as I'm concerned. Gus Minissi.

560
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:27,347
Ask Cobby, he knows him.

561
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,545
- Gus, 100 percent.
- Get hold of him.

562
00:38:29,722 --> 00:38:32,555
- He'll take the heat and won't flap his lip.
- Get hold of him.

563
00:38:32,725 --> 00:38:33,953
Sure, Doc.

564
00:38:34,127 --> 00:38:35,685
Any ideas about a hooligan?

565
00:38:37,263 --> 00:38:40,630
I know a very good heavy. I haven't
seen him in some time. Red Traynor.

566
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,530
- He's taking the cure.
- Rule him out.

567
00:38:43,703 --> 00:38:45,068
What about Timmons?

568
00:38:45,238 --> 00:38:46,535
- Who's that?
- My doorman.

569
00:38:46,706 --> 00:38:48,674
That busted-down wrestler,
are you kidding?

570
00:38:48,841 --> 00:38:51,401
He's got nothing upstairs
but solid knuckle.

571
00:38:51,578 --> 00:38:55,708
I'm a stranger and do not know
as much as you gentlemen...

572
00:38:55,882 --> 00:38:59,079
...but what about this southerner,
this Dix?

573
00:38:59,252 --> 00:39:03,689
He impressed me as a very determined man
and far from stupid.

574
00:39:05,491 --> 00:39:09,154
Frankly, I don't like the guy,
but I never saw a hooligan I did like.

575
00:39:09,329 --> 00:39:13,322
They're like left-handed pitchers.
They all have a screw loose somewhere.

576
00:39:13,967 --> 00:39:15,901
I suppose he's as good
as anybody, though.

577
00:39:16,636 --> 00:39:19,002
Gus thinks he's tops,
and Gus is usually right.

578
00:39:19,172 --> 00:39:21,800
I like him. I say we take him.

579
00:39:22,609 --> 00:39:24,008
Suits me. You're the boss.

580
00:39:24,177 --> 00:39:27,578
Well, I better be getting home now.
Mrs. Ciavelli's worried about the kid.

581
00:39:27,747 --> 00:39:30,739
- What's the trouble?
- He's got a cold again.

582
00:39:30,984 --> 00:39:33,976
She takes him out first thing
in the morning. It's cold then.

583
00:39:34,153 --> 00:39:36,417
She claims a baby's gotta taste fresh air.

584
00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:41,526
Like I'm always telling her, "If you want
fresh air, don't look for it in this town!"

585
00:39:41,694 --> 00:39:43,184
Here.

586
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,327
He's 9 months old there.

587
00:39:49,502 --> 00:39:52,300
I must say, I envy you,
being a family man.

588
00:39:52,472 --> 00:39:53,905
Yeah.

589
00:39:54,073 --> 00:39:56,940
Well, always problems, huh?

590
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,843
One good thing about Dix,
you can get him for nickels and dimes.

591
00:40:04,484 --> 00:40:06,247
Tell me something, Cobby.

592
00:40:06,419 --> 00:40:09,752
It's your money, isn't it?
Not Mr. Emmerich's.

593
00:40:10,356 --> 00:40:12,756
- What difference does it make?
- None, really.

594
00:40:15,395 --> 00:40:19,126
It's this way. Mr. Emmerich doesn't want
this transaction appearing in his books.

595
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:22,234
I'm not risking anything.
He's good for it in case of a runout.

596
00:40:22,402 --> 00:40:24,597
Then you haven't got a worry.

597
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:27,305
No.

598
00:40:33,313 --> 00:40:35,543
- Where are you going?
- I found a place.

599
00:40:35,715 --> 00:40:38,445
A girlfriend's leaving town.
She let me have her apartment.

600
00:40:38,951 --> 00:40:41,146
The rent's paid up
till the first of the month.

601
00:40:41,321 --> 00:40:44,222
- When did this happen?
- This morning, before you woke up.

602
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,187
I bumped into her on the street.

603
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:49,954
Remember that tall brunette, used to do
the novelty dances at the Bandwagon?

604
00:40:50,129 --> 00:40:53,587
Blanche LaRue. It sure was nice of her.

605
00:40:53,766 --> 00:40:57,327
I can't go living off you forever, can I?

606
00:40:57,503 --> 00:41:00,199
- I was glad to help out.
- Yeah.

607
00:41:00,373 --> 00:41:03,774
Well, maybe I can do something
for you sometime.

608
00:41:04,243 --> 00:41:06,939
You don't owe me a thing. Forget it.

609
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,347
<i>Well...</i>

610
00:41:10,016 --> 00:41:11,244
Goodbye.

611
00:41:11,417 --> 00:41:14,250
- How are you fixed for dough?
- A couple of bucks. Enough.

612
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,853
Here, take this and...

613
00:41:16,022 --> 00:41:17,887
No. No, thanks, Dix.

614
00:41:18,057 --> 00:41:20,150
I'm all through bothering.

615
00:41:21,294 --> 00:41:23,387
Give us a kiss, huh?

616
00:41:42,415 --> 00:41:43,973
Doll.

617
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:46,279
Yes, Dix?

618
00:41:50,757 --> 00:41:53,021
Maybe I'll wanna get in touch with you.

619
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,084
Sure, my new address.

620
00:41:56,262 --> 00:41:59,561
I'll be at 42 Merton Street.

621
00:41:59,732 --> 00:42:01,700
42 Merton.

622
00:42:19,318 --> 00:42:20,546
<i>- Hello.
- Hello, Dix?</i>

623
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,085
<i>- Yeah.
- Dix, this is Cobby.</i>

624
00:42:22,255 --> 00:42:24,951
<i>- Oh, hiya, Cobby.
- I got your number from Gus.</i>

625
00:42:25,124 --> 00:42:26,682
<i>- Yeah.
- Look, Dix...</i>

626
00:42:26,859 --> 00:42:29,555
<i>... do you want to get into something big?
I mean, real big.</i>

627
00:42:29,729 --> 00:42:32,459
<i>If you do, be at Gus' tonight at 10:00.</i>

628
00:42:32,632 --> 00:42:33,860
Right.

629
00:42:34,033 --> 00:42:35,830
Everything's here.

630
00:42:36,002 --> 00:42:40,234
The soft spot's an old steam tunnel.
Manhole's on the corner.

631
00:42:40,406 --> 00:42:43,967
You drop into the manhole at 11:45.
Dix will cover you.

632
00:42:44,143 --> 00:42:45,667
You break through the wall.

633
00:42:45,845 --> 00:42:49,804
It'll take about six minutes to get
into Belletier's from the furnace room.

634
00:42:49,982 --> 00:42:51,506
Watch out for floor wires.

635
00:42:51,951 --> 00:42:55,045
Make your way up the back stairs
and jump the alarm system.

636
00:42:55,221 --> 00:42:57,189
That will take another three minutes.

637
00:42:57,356 --> 00:43:02,419
At exactly 11:54,
Dix and I will come to the back door.

638
00:43:02,595 --> 00:43:04,222
You open it for us.

639
00:43:04,397 --> 00:43:06,797
- I'll be waiting for you.
- Good.

640
00:43:07,733 --> 00:43:09,394
Any questions?

641
00:43:09,569 --> 00:43:11,935
- Everything sounds okay.
- Same here.

642
00:43:12,104 --> 00:43:13,901
Well, guess I better be getting home.

643
00:43:14,073 --> 00:43:16,132
- How's the boy?
- Oh, he's okay.

644
00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:18,641
Ran a temperature yesterday.
Pretty high too.

645
00:43:18,811 --> 00:43:21,974
We called the doctor, but temperatures
don't mean so much with kids.

646
00:43:22,148 --> 00:43:24,241
He's back to normal today.

647
00:43:24,417 --> 00:43:27,215
- See you tomorrow night, 11:30.
- Good night.

648
00:43:28,054 --> 00:43:30,215
Have you got a minute, Dix?

649
00:43:30,389 --> 00:43:32,619
Sure. What's on your mind?

650
00:43:32,792 --> 00:43:37,957
My friend, what do you know
about this fellow Emmerich?

651
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:41,691
You mean the big fixer?
I've heard his name, that's all.

652
00:43:41,868 --> 00:43:44,803
- I can talk to you, I think.
- Sure.

653
00:43:44,971 --> 00:43:48,532
Mr. Emmerich is taking the jewelry
off our hands.

654
00:43:49,942 --> 00:43:51,432
You sure are surprising me, Doc.

655
00:43:51,611 --> 00:43:54,102
I don't exactly trust Mr. Emmerich.

656
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,646
Just a feeling. I may be wrong.

657
00:43:56,816 --> 00:43:59,717
But it's up to us to collect, you and me.

658
00:43:59,886 --> 00:44:03,253
<i>Everything may go smooth,
but if it don't...</i>

659
00:44:03,422 --> 00:44:06,050
- If he's got it, we'll collect.
- Good.

660
00:44:06,225 --> 00:44:10,093
We'll meet Mr. Emmerich after the caper,
deliver the jewelry and get our money.

661
00:44:10,263 --> 00:44:12,697
The payment is to be immediate
and in cash.

662
00:44:12,865 --> 00:44:15,891
After that, we pay off and scatter.

663
00:44:16,569 --> 00:44:19,436
Don't worry, Doc. We'll collect.

664
00:44:38,624 --> 00:44:40,114
Lon...

665
00:44:40,293 --> 00:44:42,158
...is that you?

666
00:44:42,328 --> 00:44:44,990
- Lon?
- Yes, May.

667
00:44:47,366 --> 00:44:48,594
Come in, Lon.

668
00:44:48,768 --> 00:44:51,703
- I've got a business appointment.
- Sit down a minute.

669
00:44:53,673 --> 00:44:57,302
It's 11:30. Isn't that
rather late for business?

670
00:44:57,777 --> 00:44:59,870
- Lon.
- Yes, May?

671
00:45:00,046 --> 00:45:01,274
I'm not feeling well.

672
00:45:01,447 --> 00:45:03,608
You haven't been feeling well
for a long time.

673
00:45:03,783 --> 00:45:05,307
At night, I get nervous.

674
00:45:05,484 --> 00:45:09,215
And when I get nervous, I hate
to stay in this big house all by myself.

675
00:45:09,388 --> 00:45:12,824
Look here. May, you're not alone.
There are three servants in the house.

676
00:45:13,225 --> 00:45:15,819
- All you have to...
- I know. Press a button.

677
00:45:16,329 --> 00:45:18,490
Well, what do you want me to do?

678
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:22,233
Sit down, Lon.

679
00:45:24,537 --> 00:45:26,129
All right.

680
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:29,631
Do I sit here and watch you
read a magazine?

681
00:45:29,809 --> 00:45:32,209
- Would that be so awful?
- Oh, now, look, May...

682
00:45:32,378 --> 00:45:34,175
We could play cards.

683
00:45:34,347 --> 00:45:36,941
- Casino, like we used to.
- Some other night.

684
00:45:37,483 --> 00:45:40,111
Please, Lon, just one hand.

685
00:45:40,286 --> 00:45:42,481
I couldn't sleep last night.

686
00:45:42,655 --> 00:45:44,714
Then I got to thinking of the old days...

687
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:49,520
...how we used to like to stay up
and play casino. Just the two of us.

688
00:45:49,962 --> 00:45:53,921
Yes. I wish I could stay, but I can't.

689
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,761
My dear, this is business.

690
00:45:57,169 --> 00:45:58,500
I tell you what I'll do.

691
00:45:58,671 --> 00:46:02,732
I'll look in later, and if you're still awake,
we'll have a little game.

692
00:46:32,271 --> 00:46:34,501
Take your keys, please. We're closing up.

693
00:46:34,674 --> 00:46:36,403
Okay.

694
00:46:45,217 --> 00:46:47,651
- All set?
- Yeah.

695
00:47:23,889 --> 00:47:26,119
Better be careful
how you handle this stuff.

696
00:47:26,292 --> 00:47:28,522
They'll pick you up in little pieces.

697
00:48:33,826 --> 00:48:35,817
What time have you got?

698
00:48:36,829 --> 00:48:38,262
Good.

699
00:48:53,512 --> 00:48:54,740
Good luck, Doc.

700
00:48:55,881 --> 00:48:57,940
Did he give you the soup?

701
00:50:03,649 --> 00:50:06,049
Here's the electric eye.

702
00:50:40,252 --> 00:50:41,844
Soup.

703
00:51:46,352 --> 00:51:49,185
It's gonna take a lot to blow this baby.

704
00:52:45,411 --> 00:52:47,345
Here goes.

705
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:27,180
- What's that?
- Keep going.

706
00:53:33,692 --> 00:53:35,956
Hey, Doc, alarms are going off
all over the block.

707
00:53:36,128 --> 00:53:38,790
- The blast must've shook the whole system.
- What do we do?

708
00:53:38,964 --> 00:53:41,125
I would hate to leave now.
We're so close.

709
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,962
- I'm for finishing what we started.
- How about you, Louis?

710
00:53:44,136 --> 00:53:46,104
- It's okay with me.
- Will Gus hold still?

711
00:53:46,271 --> 00:53:48,432
Don't worry about Gus.

712
00:53:53,479 --> 00:53:54,969
What's the matter?

713
00:53:55,147 --> 00:53:57,047
The drill broke.

714
00:53:58,784 --> 00:54:02,584
We should finish before 12:15,
before the watchman gets here.

715
00:54:02,754 --> 00:54:05,086
The store cop? Let me worry about him.

716
00:54:09,695 --> 00:54:11,185
- Hear that, Dix?
- Yeah.

717
00:54:11,363 --> 00:54:13,763
- Coming this way?
- From the river. Don't sound good.

718
00:54:13,932 --> 00:54:15,593
Take a look, see what's happening.

719
00:55:10,856 --> 00:55:12,221
We gotta blow, fast!

720
00:55:12,391 --> 00:55:15,383
This is everything of real value.

721
00:55:16,395 --> 00:55:18,761
- Heavy, ain't she?
- Plenty.

722
00:55:20,966 --> 00:55:23,025
This is the biggest one yet.

723
00:55:23,202 --> 00:55:25,693
Wait till you see it in the papers.

724
00:55:52,598 --> 00:55:54,566
Watchman. Pull open the door, Louis.

725
00:55:54,733 --> 00:55:57,361
- Maybe he'll go away.
- Do what Dix says.

726
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:02,106
Now.

727
00:56:08,313 --> 00:56:09,974
Follow me.

728
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,560
- Gus, take me home.
- Where did it get you?

729
00:57:30,729 --> 00:57:33,755
Thigh. I can feel it going up.
I think I got the slug in my belly.

730
00:57:33,932 --> 00:57:37,800
- I'll take you to a guy, used to be a doctor.
- No, no. Take me home, Gus!

731
00:57:37,969 --> 00:57:39,561
All right, Louis.

732
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:04,686
It's after 1.
They should be here any minute.

733
00:58:05,731 --> 00:58:07,824
Unless there's been trouble.

734
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:10,467
Where is Angela tonight?

735
00:58:10,969 --> 00:58:13,130
She's at her sister's.

736
00:58:13,305 --> 00:58:15,034
She says.

737
00:58:15,574 --> 00:58:17,701
I'd go easy on that liquor if I were you.

738
00:58:17,876 --> 00:58:20,902
Half-drunk, I got better wits
than most people.

739
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,980
And more nerve.

740
00:58:25,884 --> 00:58:27,317
You look worried, my friend.

741
00:58:27,486 --> 00:58:29,477
Something bothering you?

742
00:58:31,523 --> 00:58:32,922
Live and learn.

743
00:58:33,091 --> 00:58:36,527
All these years, I've been suffering
from an inferiority complex.

744
00:58:36,695 --> 00:58:39,061
I should've been in the money
years ago.

745
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:42,223
You big boys, what have you got?

746
00:58:42,401 --> 00:58:44,460
Front. Nothing but front.

747
00:58:44,636 --> 00:58:46,536
<i>And when that slips...</i>

748
00:58:47,806 --> 00:58:50,934
I do believe our guests are arriving.

749
00:59:03,722 --> 00:59:05,986
Well? Everything go all right?

750
00:59:08,493 --> 00:59:10,256
This is a friend of mine, Mr. Brannom.

751
00:59:10,429 --> 00:59:12,488
He's been a great help to me
on this deal.

752
00:59:12,664 --> 00:59:14,996
Follow me. Follow me, gentlemen.

753
00:59:15,167 --> 00:59:17,499
It's much more comfortable in here.

754
00:59:27,646 --> 00:59:31,446
Say, I'll bet that thing is full
of Koh-i-noors and Grand Moguls, eh?

755
00:59:31,616 --> 00:59:33,140
Could be.

756
00:59:34,119 --> 00:59:35,950
Sit down, gentlemen. Sit down.

757
00:59:36,121 --> 00:59:38,851
- Let me get you a drink.
- No, thanks.

758
00:59:39,591 --> 00:59:40,990
Do you mind if we have a look?

759
00:59:41,159 --> 00:59:43,525
You're entitled to a look, naturally.

760
01:00:04,115 --> 01:00:06,413
- Convinced?
- Why, of course. Of course.

761
01:00:06,585 --> 01:00:10,646
There never was any doubt in my mind.
You know, I know this fellow's reputation.

762
01:00:10,822 --> 01:00:13,416
Just a matter of curiosity, that's all.

763
01:00:14,226 --> 01:00:17,059
I'll bet the appraisal is going to exceed
even your estimate...

764
01:00:17,229 --> 01:00:18,662
Good. Good.

765
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:21,492
In that case, I'd just like to see
the color of the money.

766
01:00:22,701 --> 01:00:26,797
<i>Gentlemen, I must admit
at this moment I...</i>

767
01:00:26,972 --> 01:00:28,701
I'm embarrassed.

768
01:00:28,874 --> 01:00:31,900
- You mean you haven't got the money?
- Oh, I have it.

769
01:00:32,077 --> 01:00:35,137
- That is, I have the assurance of it.
- You haven't got it.

770
01:00:35,413 --> 01:00:39,179
No, I haven't got the currency
right here in my hands...

771
01:00:39,351 --> 01:00:41,945
...but it's promised
by an unimpeachable source.

772
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:45,920
Gentlemen, I'm afraid we were
a little hasty. We moved too fast.

773
01:00:46,091 --> 01:00:48,321
We moved on your word.

774
01:00:48,493 --> 01:00:51,087
Wait a minute.
That's a large sum of money, you know...

775
01:00:51,263 --> 01:00:53,288
...considering present-day conditions...

776
01:00:53,465 --> 01:00:56,263
...and considering the fact
that we had to have it in cash.

777
01:00:56,434 --> 01:01:00,928
So I'm afraid a few days more
are needed to raise it.

778
01:01:01,106 --> 01:01:04,940
A few days more may not seem like
a very long time to you, Mr. Emmerich.

779
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:08,443
But to me, carrying this around,
it would seem like years.

780
01:01:08,613 --> 01:01:10,740
I understand.
I've got a solution for that too.

781
01:01:10,916 --> 01:01:13,384
That is, if you boys trust me.

782
01:01:13,552 --> 01:01:18,251
And if you don't, well, there's nothing
I can say except that I'm sorry.

783
01:01:19,457 --> 01:01:22,358
Mr. Emmerich,
what are you trying to tell us?

784
01:01:22,694 --> 01:01:25,162
About the jewels.

785
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:27,855
Wouldn't be safe for you
to carry that stuff around.

786
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,195
You mean, we leave them with you?

787
01:01:30,502 --> 01:01:34,131
Well, when the police start looking
for that stuff tomorrow morning...

788
01:01:34,306 --> 01:01:36,297
...they're not likely to call me up.

789
01:01:36,474 --> 01:01:40,274
They're not likely to send detectives out
to search my house, you know.

790
01:01:40,779 --> 01:01:42,974
<i>You, on the other hand, Doc, you...</i>

791
01:01:43,148 --> 01:01:44,581
You're just out of prison.

792
01:01:45,283 --> 01:01:48,548
They're certainly gonna be looking
for the big-timers like yourself.

793
01:01:50,789 --> 01:01:54,919
Some smart cop might even connect
this burglary with your release.

794
01:02:01,633 --> 01:02:03,999
Well, there you are.

795
01:02:05,437 --> 01:02:08,770
Of course, as I said, it's up to you.

796
01:02:09,674 --> 01:02:11,505
Keep in touch with me through Cobby.

797
01:02:11,676 --> 01:02:14,577
You did a great job, Emmerich,
but it's not working.

798
01:02:14,746 --> 01:02:17,943
- Bob!
- Back away and keep out of this, Emmerich.

799
01:02:18,116 --> 01:02:21,415
Now, you, farmer, get your hands up.

800
01:02:22,787 --> 01:02:24,812
And you, Fritz...

801
01:02:25,557 --> 01:02:27,752
...throw the bag on the floor.

802
01:02:27,926 --> 01:02:29,689
Over here by my feet.

803
01:02:29,861 --> 01:02:31,761
Be careful how you throw it.

804
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:33,727
I got a pistol expert medal.

805
01:02:33,898 --> 01:02:36,128
- What do you say, Dix?
- He's got no say.

806
01:02:36,701 --> 01:02:39,898
He makes a crooked move,
he'll never pitch another forkful of manure.

807
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:44,399
He's got us, Doc. Toss him the bag.

808
01:02:44,843 --> 01:02:46,970
You're not as dumb as you look.

809
01:02:59,224 --> 01:03:00,714
Are you a man or what?

810
01:03:00,892 --> 01:03:04,123
Trying to gyp and double-cross me
with no guts for it.

811
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:07,897
What's inside of you?
What's keeping you alive?

812
01:03:15,507 --> 01:03:17,566
Why don't you kill me?

813
01:03:18,009 --> 01:03:20,273
- What's stopping you?
- Okay, mister...

814
01:03:20,445 --> 01:03:23,608
Dix, listen to me. Don't kill him.
It's too easy an out for him.

815
01:03:23,782 --> 01:03:25,545
Sit down, sir.

816
01:03:27,118 --> 01:03:29,609
Whatever possessed you
to pull such a stunt?

817
01:03:29,788 --> 01:03:32,416
I was broke, facing bankruptcy.

818
01:03:32,624 --> 01:03:34,649
He's a witness.
He saw me knock off that guy.

819
01:03:34,826 --> 01:03:38,626
- You think he wouldn't holler?
- He's in no position to talk.

820
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:42,058
What did you and your man on the floor
intend to do with the jewels?

821
01:03:42,233 --> 01:03:45,031
Leave town.
Sell them off a little at a time.

822
01:03:45,203 --> 01:03:48,639
No good. The police would have been
on you after the first sale.

823
01:03:48,807 --> 01:03:51,776
You can't go peddling stuff like this around
when the heat's on.

824
01:03:51,943 --> 01:03:53,968
Let's not fool around here any longer.

825
01:03:54,145 --> 01:03:55,373
Be patient, Dix.

826
01:03:55,547 --> 01:03:58,846
Mr. Emmerich got us into this hole,
and he's going to get us out.

827
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:02,615
I didn't save your life
because I'm a lover of humanity.

828
01:04:02,787 --> 01:04:05,051
We're in trouble with
this satchel full of jewels.

829
01:04:05,223 --> 01:04:08,249
As things stand, it's just so much junk.

830
01:04:08,526 --> 01:04:11,518
- There's nothing I can do.
- Yes, there is, Mr. Emmerich.

831
01:04:11,696 --> 01:04:14,256
You can go to the insurance company.

832
01:04:14,966 --> 01:04:17,059
- Insurance company?
- They'll listen to reason.

833
01:04:17,235 --> 01:04:18,930
This is a very bad jolt for them.

834
01:04:19,104 --> 01:04:22,699
It's possible they'll be willing to buy
the jewels back, no questions asked...

835
01:04:22,874 --> 01:04:25,866
...for as high as 25 percent
of what they're worth.

836
01:04:26,044 --> 01:04:27,705
Doc, let's blow.

837
01:04:27,879 --> 01:04:29,744
I'll start on it tomorrow.

838
01:04:30,648 --> 01:04:32,081
Get busy, Emmerich.

839
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:35,947
And remember, you might have been
lying here dead with your friend.

840
01:04:37,455 --> 01:04:39,582
Shall I get in touch with you
through Cobby?

841
01:04:39,758 --> 01:04:42,318
No. I'll get in touch with you.

842
01:04:42,494 --> 01:04:44,155
Come on, Dix.

843
01:04:44,696 --> 01:04:47,824
I advise you to clean up after your friend.

844
01:04:53,138 --> 01:04:56,107
- Don't give him any water.
- He asked for it.

845
01:04:56,508 --> 01:04:58,476
- I said, don't give him any water.
- Let go.

846
01:04:58,643 --> 01:05:01,111
You wanna kill him?
Maybe he's hurt in the stomach.

847
01:05:01,279 --> 01:05:04,146
Where's the doctor?
Why doesn't he come?

848
01:05:04,315 --> 01:05:06,806
You said 10 minutes. It's half an hour.

849
01:05:06,985 --> 01:05:08,714
Louis will die.

850
01:05:08,887 --> 01:05:10,616
Why can't I take him to the hospital?

851
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:14,418
They wheel him into an operating room,
you'll never see him again.

852
01:05:14,859 --> 01:05:17,726
Take it easy, Maria.
Louis is gonna be all right.

853
01:05:17,896 --> 01:05:20,057
The doctor will be here,
fix him up good as new.

854
01:05:20,465 --> 01:05:22,729
You and Louis are gonna have
six more kids.

855
01:05:22,901 --> 01:05:26,735
All as fat as pigs, big black eyes,
lots of hair.

856
01:05:26,905 --> 01:05:28,736
Just like Louis, eh, Maria?

857
01:05:28,907 --> 01:05:30,932
Stay away from the baby!

858
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:40,911
Tell me the truth.
How did it happen?

859
01:05:41,085 --> 01:05:44,543
- I told you. A fight.
- Louis don't fight. You know that.

860
01:05:46,457 --> 01:05:47,981
Why is it always you?

861
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:50,889
Whenever Louis gets into trouble,
you're around.

862
01:05:51,062 --> 01:05:53,462
You dirty cripple! You crooked-back!

863
01:05:53,765 --> 01:05:56,029
- You have the evil eye!
- Shut your mouth, Maria!

864
01:05:56,201 --> 01:05:58,601
I don't let anybody say that to me.

865
01:06:09,447 --> 01:06:11,472
I'm sorry, Gus...

866
01:06:11,883 --> 01:06:13,612
...but I gotta blame somebody.

867
01:06:14,018 --> 01:06:16,384
What I carry on my back,
I was born with it.

868
01:06:16,554 --> 01:06:18,215
I didn't grow it myself.

869
01:06:18,389 --> 01:06:21,756
Please forgive me, Gus. I didn't mean it.

870
01:06:28,967 --> 01:06:32,494
- Listen to that.
- Yeah. Must be a fire.

871
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:35,503
It's not in this neighborhood, though.
Someplace else.

872
01:06:36,174 --> 01:06:39,234
Oh, Gus. I pray to God
that doctor get here quick.

873
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:42,004
He'll be here any minute, Maria.

874
01:06:44,515 --> 01:06:47,245
Sounds like a soul in hell.

875
01:07:31,262 --> 01:07:35,426
Dix, why don't you get in touch with Gus
and let him take you to the doctor.

876
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,761
- Don't be foolish.
- I don't like doctors.

877
01:07:37,936 --> 01:07:39,597
I'm getting along all right.

878
01:07:39,771 --> 01:07:43,138
That bullet just ripped through my side
and went on about its business.

879
01:07:43,308 --> 01:07:46,368
- Good thing I jumped.
- How can things go so wrong?

880
01:07:46,544 --> 01:07:47,841
How is it possible?

881
01:07:48,012 --> 01:07:50,378
One man killed,
two others plugged.

882
01:07:50,548 --> 01:07:53,847
I'm out 30 grand. We got a load
of rocks we can't even peddle.

883
01:07:54,018 --> 01:07:56,009
Quit crying and get me some bourbon.

884
01:08:01,192 --> 01:08:03,422
I must be awful stupid.

885
01:08:03,594 --> 01:08:06,028
Here I am with a good business...

886
01:08:07,065 --> 01:08:08,692
...money rolling in...

887
01:08:08,866 --> 01:08:11,892
...I gotta get mixed up
in a thing like this.

888
01:08:12,904 --> 01:08:15,168
I ought to have my head examined.

889
01:08:18,409 --> 01:08:20,877
Yeah, hello, hello.
Yeah, this is Cobby.

890
01:08:21,846 --> 01:08:23,108
What?

891
01:08:23,281 --> 01:08:26,512
It's Gus. Dragnet's out,
and they're combing the district.

892
01:08:26,851 --> 01:08:29,376
He wants to talk to you.
You, Dix.

893
01:08:32,023 --> 01:08:33,285
Gus? Dix.

894
01:08:33,458 --> 01:08:34,720
Yeah. Listen careful.

895
01:08:34,892 --> 01:08:38,225
Cops are knocking over joints along
the boulevard, meat wagons and all.

896
01:08:38,396 --> 01:08:40,728
Now, look, I already called a guy,
Eddie Donato.

897
01:08:40,898 --> 01:08:44,493
Donato's got a grocery down by the river.
116 Front Street. You got that?

898
01:08:44,669 --> 01:08:46,466
<i>Yeah. Thanks, Gus. How's Louis?</i>

899
01:08:46,637 --> 01:08:49,970
Louis is not so good. He got a slug
in his belly. Doc's doing all he can.

900
01:08:50,141 --> 01:08:52,575
Here they are now, the happiness boys.

901
01:08:52,744 --> 01:08:55,372
Hello. How are you?
Looks like I'm in for a working-over.

902
01:08:55,546 --> 01:08:57,946
Look. Go down to Eddie's
by way of the old car barn.

903
01:08:58,116 --> 01:09:00,710
It's deserted at night.
You get beyond that, you're okay.

904
01:09:00,885 --> 01:09:03,877
Cops never bother Eddie's neighborhood.
So long, Dix. Blow now.

905
01:09:04,055 --> 01:09:05,955
All right, all right, all right.

906
01:09:12,059 --> 01:09:15,028
What? Please talk a little louder.

907
01:09:15,196 --> 01:09:16,458
This is Eddie Donato.

908
01:09:16,931 --> 01:09:19,695
Oh, sure, sure.
I'll get Doc for you.

909
01:09:19,867 --> 01:09:21,994
<i>Hey, dottore, I got your man.</i>

910
01:09:26,173 --> 01:09:27,640
Hello.

911
01:09:28,209 --> 01:09:29,471
Yes.

912
01:09:29,977 --> 01:09:32,036
Fine, fine.

913
01:09:32,213 --> 01:09:33,475
Good.

914
01:09:33,648 --> 01:09:35,445
That will be satisfactory.

915
01:09:42,356 --> 01:09:44,017
- Cobby?
- Yes.

916
01:09:44,191 --> 01:09:45,818
Emmerich came through.

917
01:09:45,993 --> 01:09:47,984
The insurance people say okay.

918
01:09:48,162 --> 01:09:51,063
Of course, we have to wait
till the banks open Monday morning.

919
01:09:51,232 --> 01:09:55,134
But it's 250,000, which is not bad.

920
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:02,266
- What's the matter?
- As a lawyer, you may be very brilliant.

921
01:10:02,443 --> 01:10:05,571
But as a casino player,
you have a lot to learn.

922
01:10:05,746 --> 01:10:08,579
- You don't mind if I smoke, do you?
- Of course not, Lon.

923
01:10:09,483 --> 01:10:11,917
Lon, how could you make
a play like that?

924
01:10:12,086 --> 01:10:14,782
You won't make
a single point this hand.

925
01:10:14,955 --> 01:10:17,583
- Come in.
- Two gentlemen to see you, sir.

926
01:10:17,758 --> 01:10:19,419
They are from the police department.

927
01:10:19,593 --> 01:10:21,959
What on earth could they want, Lon?

928
01:10:22,129 --> 01:10:24,927
Well, something to do
with a case, I suppose.

929
01:10:25,099 --> 01:10:27,897
- Excuse me?
- Oh, bother. We were having so much fun.

930
01:10:28,069 --> 01:10:30,196
- Hurry back.
- Sure.

931
01:10:44,318 --> 01:10:46,582
- Yes?
- Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Emmerich.

932
01:10:46,754 --> 01:10:49,222
I'm Andrews.
This is Officer Janocek.

933
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:51,483
- How do you do?
- How are you?

934
01:10:51,659 --> 01:10:54,389
Well, what can I do for you?

935
01:10:54,562 --> 01:10:56,689
Do you know a man named Robert Brannom?

936
01:10:56,864 --> 01:10:58,661
Brannom. Yes, of course.

937
01:10:58,833 --> 01:11:00,801
What is it?
Something the matter?

938
01:11:00,968 --> 01:11:02,458
There sure is, Mr. Emmerich.

939
01:11:02,636 --> 01:11:05,196
His body was pulled
out of the river this morning.

940
01:11:05,706 --> 01:11:08,436
- Great heavens.
- But it was no drowning.

941
01:11:08,609 --> 01:11:10,304
He had a hole through his pump.

942
01:11:10,478 --> 01:11:12,036
He'd been shot.

943
01:11:13,647 --> 01:11:16,480
Will you step in here for a minute?

944
01:11:20,988 --> 01:11:23,548
<i>Well, I must say, this is...</i>

945
01:11:23,958 --> 01:11:26,051
It's quite a shock.
Bob Brannom, eh?

946
01:11:26,227 --> 01:11:29,025
Murdered, you say?
Great heavens.

947
01:11:29,196 --> 01:11:33,098
We found a list of names in his pocket
written on your business stationery.

948
01:11:33,267 --> 01:11:37,033
- Who are these people, do you know?
- Oh, that's a list of my debtors.

949
01:11:37,204 --> 01:11:40,230
Brannom was working for me.
He was trying to collect old debts...

950
01:11:40,407 --> 01:11:42,534
...without much success, I must say.

951
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:45,372
Was he giving the treatment
to anybody on this list?

952
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:47,572
Certainly not.

953
01:11:47,748 --> 01:11:51,878
Then you don't think there's any connection
between this work for you and his death?

954
01:11:52,052 --> 01:11:54,043
- None whatever.
- When did you see him last?

955
01:11:54,221 --> 01:11:57,452
Well, now, last Wednesday evening,
in this room.

956
01:11:57,625 --> 01:12:00,856
Yes. We went over that list together.

957
01:12:01,595 --> 01:12:04,393
The coroner says he was plugged
at 1:00 or 2:00 this morning.

958
01:12:04,565 --> 01:12:06,658
Not much after the Belletier job was pulled.

959
01:12:07,201 --> 01:12:08,998
We figured there might be a connection.

960
01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:11,468
One of the heist guys was shot,
we know that.

961
01:12:11,639 --> 01:12:14,437
There was blood on the floor.
Maybe it was Brannom's.

962
01:12:14,608 --> 01:12:17,372
He could've died in the car,
they dropped him in the river.

963
01:12:17,545 --> 01:12:22,346
Oh, no, no. Bob Brannom's a good deal
of a roughneck, but he's no criminal.

964
01:12:22,516 --> 01:12:25,974
And if I'm any judge, Belletier's was
the work of bigtime professionals.

965
01:12:27,188 --> 01:12:31,284
Oh, no, no, gentlemen.
Bob Brannom mixed up in any burglary...

966
01:12:31,458 --> 01:12:33,119
...why, that's inconceivable.

967
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:34,759
I see.

968
01:12:35,095 --> 01:12:38,826
Oh, one more thing, Mr. Emmerich.
Just for the records, of course.

969
01:12:38,999 --> 01:12:42,059
Could you give us an account
of your whereabouts last night?

970
01:12:42,236 --> 01:12:43,999
Yes, I could.

971
01:12:44,772 --> 01:12:46,672
Why? Is it necessary?

972
01:12:46,841 --> 01:12:48,934
I'm afraid so, Mr. Emmerich.

973
01:12:49,443 --> 01:12:53,402
Well, boys, a man of my years
hates to make an admission like this...

974
01:12:53,581 --> 01:12:57,210
...but a Miss Phinlay is living
in my cottage on the river.

975
01:12:57,384 --> 01:13:03,084
And last night, I went to visit her
at about 11:30, I think it was.

976
01:13:03,357 --> 01:13:05,257
Stayed rather late.

977
01:13:05,426 --> 01:13:08,418
Oh, she'll verify this, of course.

978
01:13:08,896 --> 01:13:10,727
Oh, but boys...

979
01:13:11,298 --> 01:13:13,266
...use a little discretion, eh?

980
01:13:13,434 --> 01:13:15,664
Unless, of course, it serves
some useful purpose.

981
01:13:15,836 --> 01:13:18,862
I understand, Mr. Emmerich,
and thank you very much for your help.

982
01:13:19,039 --> 01:13:21,007
Oh, not at all. Thank you.

983
01:13:21,175 --> 01:13:23,871
And say, if I can be any further help,
you just call on me.

984
01:13:24,044 --> 01:13:26,410
- Good day.
- Good day.

985
01:13:43,397 --> 01:13:44,989
<i>- Hello, Angela?
- Yes.</i>

986
01:13:45,165 --> 01:13:47,030
<i>- This is Lon.
- Why haven't you called me?</i>

987
01:13:47,201 --> 01:13:49,533
Listen, baby,
you may have a visit from the police.

988
01:13:49,703 --> 01:13:53,639
<i>- Is it your wife?
- No, no. It's nothing like that.</i>

989
01:13:54,108 --> 01:13:57,544
They'll probably ask you
some questions about last night.

990
01:13:57,711 --> 01:13:59,042
Now, listen, baby.

991
01:13:59,213 --> 01:14:02,273
I want you to tell them
that I was there with you...

992
01:14:02,449 --> 01:14:06,010
...from 11:30 until 3 in the morning.

993
01:14:06,186 --> 01:14:08,950
<i>- That's most of the night.
- Most of the night, that's right.</i>

994
01:14:09,123 --> 01:14:11,023
<i>- Now, is that clear?
- Sure, it's clear.</i>

995
01:14:11,191 --> 01:14:14,718
Yes. Oh, no, no. Just politics, baby.

996
01:14:14,895 --> 01:14:18,387
<i>- Good old dirty politics.
- All right. Call me right away.</i>

997
01:14:18,565 --> 01:14:20,430
<i>- Yes, I'll call you later.
- Don't forget.</i>

998
01:14:20,601 --> 01:14:22,364
Yes.

999
01:14:36,383 --> 01:14:37,850
Can we go on playing?

1000
01:14:38,786 --> 01:14:40,686
Certainly. Why not?

1001
01:14:41,622 --> 01:14:44,853
Why, Lon, you're as pale as a ghost.

1002
01:14:45,225 --> 01:14:46,624
What's the matter?

1003
01:14:48,829 --> 01:14:51,525
Well, I just had some bad news.

1004
01:14:52,166 --> 01:14:54,191
A man who works for me got killed.

1005
01:14:54,368 --> 01:14:57,030
Oh, Lon, how awful.
Was it an accident?

1006
01:14:57,204 --> 01:14:58,603
No.

1007
01:14:58,772 --> 01:15:00,865
No. It was...

1008
01:15:02,242 --> 01:15:03,504
...an intentional killing.

1009
01:15:04,211 --> 01:15:06,975
- Do they know who did it?
- No.

1010
01:15:07,147 --> 01:15:11,015
Oh, Lon, when I think of all those
awful people you come in contact with...

1011
01:15:11,185 --> 01:15:14,279
...downright criminals, I get scared.

1012
01:15:15,522 --> 01:15:19,458
Oh, there's nothing's
so different about them.

1013
01:15:20,861 --> 01:15:23,523
After all, crime is only...

1014
01:15:23,697 --> 01:15:26,791
...a left-handed form of human endeavor.

1015
01:15:32,506 --> 01:15:34,997
- Ever been in Mexico City, Dix?
- Nope.

1016
01:15:35,175 --> 01:15:38,633
It's 8000 feet up.
The air is very pure.

1017
01:15:39,046 --> 01:15:42,538
Many first-class clubs,
restaurants, a horse track...

1018
01:15:42,716 --> 01:15:44,343
...and girls.

1019
01:15:44,685 --> 01:15:46,346
Beautiful young girls.

1020
01:15:47,021 --> 01:15:49,319
How would you like to go there,
all expenses paid?

1021
01:15:49,490 --> 01:15:51,856
Sorry, Doc, not interested.
I'm heading home.

1022
01:15:52,526 --> 01:15:54,551
Listen, Dix.
You can always go home.

1023
01:15:54,728 --> 01:15:56,525
And when you do, it's nothing.

1024
01:15:56,697 --> 01:15:59,427
Believe me. I've done it. Nothing.

1025
01:16:00,034 --> 01:16:02,161
My mind's made up.

1026
01:16:02,569 --> 01:16:04,196
It's me.

1027
01:16:05,305 --> 01:16:07,170
Look, my friends.

1028
01:16:08,075 --> 01:16:09,770
My friends...

1029
01:16:10,144 --> 01:16:12,112
...I am a respectable man.

1030
01:16:12,279 --> 01:16:16,079
For Gus, I do a favor, all right?
With this picture in the paper...

1031
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:18,844
You mean you want us to blow?
Is that right, Eddie? Okay.

1032
01:16:19,019 --> 01:16:21,544
The sooner we get out of here, the better.

1033
01:16:21,755 --> 01:16:24,724
Eddie's getting to the place where
he'd talk with encouragement.

1034
01:16:24,892 --> 01:16:26,792
Oh, no. I no talk.

1035
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,951
Gus cut my belly open.

1036
01:16:29,129 --> 01:16:31,563
I'm sorry, my friends,
to bring you this bad news.

1037
01:16:31,732 --> 01:16:34,098
- I go now, please.
- Sit down, Donato.

1038
01:16:34,268 --> 01:16:37,032
You're not going anyplace till I say so.

1039
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,439
Stay put, Eddie.

1040
01:16:41,608 --> 01:16:45,408
Nobody's gonna hurt you, so long as you
sit still and keep your mouth shut.

1041
01:16:47,014 --> 01:16:51,246
The way I figure, the insurance guys sicced
the cops on that phony, and he spilled.

1042
01:16:52,019 --> 01:16:54,317
You never should've stopped me
from blasting him.

1043
01:16:54,755 --> 01:16:57,019
No, Dix. He hasn't spilled...

1044
01:16:57,191 --> 01:17:00,558
...or they wouldn't be looking for just me.
- Then how come?

1045
01:17:00,727 --> 01:17:04,527
Because there's only three or four men
who can manage a job like this.

1046
01:17:04,698 --> 01:17:08,896
Somebody in the department with
a few brains has decided I'm the guy.

1047
01:17:09,069 --> 01:17:10,627
I've been half-expecting it.

1048
01:17:10,804 --> 01:17:12,635
It doesn't worry me much.

1049
01:17:12,806 --> 01:17:15,536
We'll get our money tomorrow, you bet.

1050
01:17:15,709 --> 01:17:17,267
I hope so.

1051
01:17:17,444 --> 01:17:20,106
- Where are we going, Dix?
- I know a place.

1052
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:25,013
Eddie, if you're a smart boy,
you'll forget you ever seen us.

1053
01:17:31,458 --> 01:17:33,926
- I wanna see the commissioner.
- State your business.

1054
01:17:34,094 --> 01:17:37,188
I'm a citizen. I can see the
commissioner if I want to, can't I?

1055
01:17:37,364 --> 01:17:39,457
- Is it about Riedenschneider?
- Could be.

1056
01:17:40,033 --> 01:17:41,830
He sure gets around, that guy.

1057
01:17:42,002 --> 01:17:44,766
About 5000 people have seen him
in the last 24 hours.

1058
01:17:45,639 --> 01:17:48,802
If you get in that line and wait your turn,
you can tell your story.

1059
01:17:48,976 --> 01:17:52,673
- I won't tell anybody but the commissioner.
- Okay. Sit down and wait, buddy.

1060
01:17:52,846 --> 01:17:55,576
- But it may be some time.
- Okay.

1061
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:58,377
I'd like to see the commissioner.

1062
01:18:11,732 --> 01:18:13,290
Where do you think you're going?

1063
01:18:13,834 --> 01:18:16,064
- We're on our way home.
- Yeah?

1064
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:18,563
- Where do you live?
- South on Camden.

1065
01:18:18,739 --> 01:18:21,970
You got no business here.
This is city property. There are signs.

1066
01:18:22,676 --> 01:18:24,541
- Everybody uses it.
- You're telling me.

1067
01:18:24,711 --> 01:18:26,941
Even hoodlums have been
bringing girls here.

1068
01:18:27,114 --> 01:18:28,843
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah.

1069
01:18:29,016 --> 01:18:31,849
It's cost one of our boys his job,
on account of the beefs.

1070
01:18:32,019 --> 01:18:34,453
If I were you, I'd stay out of here.
You understand?

1071
01:18:34,621 --> 01:18:36,316
Okay, officer.

1072
01:18:38,458 --> 01:18:40,358
Hey, wait a minute.
You, with the bag.

1073
01:18:41,128 --> 01:18:42,891
Come here.

1074
01:19:25,806 --> 01:19:27,330
Dix!

1075
01:19:29,243 --> 01:19:30,870
Oh, Dix, honey.

1076
01:19:32,012 --> 01:19:33,570
You'll have to excuse me.

1077
01:19:33,747 --> 01:19:37,444
I took a couple of sleeping pills,
and I guess I'm still kind of groggy.

1078
01:19:37,618 --> 01:19:40,246
I haven't been able
to sleep much lately, Dix...

1079
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:42,445
...worrying about you and everything.

1080
01:19:42,623 --> 01:19:44,215
I was up at your place.

1081
01:19:44,391 --> 01:19:46,291
They told me the cops were after you.

1082
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:49,088
Get me some cold water
and some towels and stop yapping.

1083
01:19:49,263 --> 01:19:51,060
Sure, Dix. Sure.

1084
01:19:51,231 --> 01:19:53,062
- Get a move on.
- Oh, you bet.

1085
01:19:53,233 --> 01:19:55,201
Put in hours and hours of planning.

1086
01:19:55,369 --> 01:19:59,738
Figure everything down
to the last detail. Then what?

1087
01:19:59,906 --> 01:20:03,603
Burglar alarms start going off
all over the place for no sensible reason.

1088
01:20:03,777 --> 01:20:06,177
A gun fires of its own accord,
and a man is shot.

1089
01:20:06,346 --> 01:20:09,679
A broken-down old harness bull,
no good for anything but chasing kids...

1090
01:20:09,850 --> 01:20:10,976
...has to trip over us.

1091
01:20:11,151 --> 01:20:14,382
Blind accident.
What can you do against blind accident?

1092
01:20:14,554 --> 01:20:16,715
One thing I ought to have
figured was Emmerich.

1093
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:19,586
I know why I didn't.
I'm not kidding myself.

1094
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,591
It was the extra dough he promised.

1095
01:20:21,762 --> 01:20:24,890
I got hungry.
Greed made me blind.

1096
01:20:25,065 --> 01:20:28,466
Hey, Dix. Dix, isn't he the one
with the reward on him?

1097
01:20:28,635 --> 01:20:30,694
Mind your own business.

1098
01:20:33,373 --> 01:20:36,865
She confirmed what Emmerich said,
that he was with her from 11:30 till 3.

1099
01:20:37,044 --> 01:20:39,205
- How did she impress you?
- Very much.

1100
01:20:39,379 --> 01:20:41,574
- She's some babe.
- That's not what I mean.

1101
01:20:41,748 --> 01:20:43,613
Was her manner straightforward?

1102
01:20:43,784 --> 01:20:46,878
Oh, I guess she was
telling the truth, all right.

1103
01:20:47,054 --> 01:20:49,318
Married 20 years,
consorting with a woman...

1104
01:20:49,489 --> 01:20:52,083
...young enough to be his granddaughter.
It's disgusting.

1105
01:20:52,259 --> 01:20:54,386
But nothing about Emmerich
would surprise me.

1106
01:20:54,561 --> 01:20:56,995
Educated man who uses brains
to circumvent the law.

1107
01:20:57,164 --> 01:20:59,359
Worst type of human being.
No excuse for him.

1108
01:20:59,533 --> 01:21:01,091
- Excuse me, commissioner.
- Well?

1109
01:21:01,268 --> 01:21:03,293
There's a taxi driver
been waiting outside.

1110
01:21:03,470 --> 01:21:06,234
- Says he's got some important information.
- Concerning what?

1111
01:21:06,406 --> 01:21:09,466
I tried to find out, but he
wouldn't talk to anyone but you.

1112
01:21:09,643 --> 01:21:11,167
He's been waiting two hours.

1113
01:21:11,345 --> 01:21:13,313
- All right, send him in.
- Yes, sir.

1114
01:21:17,984 --> 01:21:19,576
- What's your name?
- Charles Wright.

1115
01:21:19,753 --> 01:21:22,313
Hackie number 14803.
Green Stripe Company.

1116
01:21:22,489 --> 01:21:25,890
- What's this information you've got?
- That doctor everybody's looking for.

1117
01:21:26,059 --> 01:21:28,619
- I think I had him for a fare.
- You drove him someplace?

1118
01:21:28,795 --> 01:21:33,562
Well, now, I'm pretty sure it was him I
picked up at the station a week ago Friday.

1119
01:21:33,734 --> 01:21:35,668
Friday the 16th?
Where did you take him?

1120
01:21:35,836 --> 01:21:37,599
To a number on Camden West.

1121
01:21:37,771 --> 01:21:40,069
I remember I asked him
if he wanted me to wait.

1122
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:42,868
I know a fella that got
rolled once on Camden West.

1123
01:21:43,043 --> 01:21:45,204
He didn't have nothing,
so they stole his pants.

1124
01:21:45,379 --> 01:21:47,404
Where did you take him?
What number?

1125
01:21:48,949 --> 01:21:52,146
4717. Kind of a storeroom.
It was dark.

1126
01:21:52,319 --> 01:21:54,810
- What's that number again?
- 4717.

1127
01:21:54,988 --> 01:21:57,115
Used to be a bookie joint, commissioner.

1128
01:21:57,991 --> 01:22:00,118
Get hold of Lieutenant Ditrich.

1129
01:22:03,797 --> 01:22:05,162
Yeah, that's him.

1130
01:22:05,332 --> 01:22:08,529
At first I thought I was making
a fool of myself by coming down here.

1131
01:22:08,702 --> 01:22:10,294
But that's him, all right.

1132
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:12,370
You may be in for a reward.
I hope so.

1133
01:22:12,539 --> 01:22:14,837
<i>Lieutenant Ditrich on one.</i>

1134
01:22:17,144 --> 01:22:19,544
<i>- Where are you, Ditrich?
- I'm at 4th Street and 6th.</i>

1135
01:22:19,713 --> 01:22:24,480
All right. Now, get a search warrant
and go to 4717 Camden West.

1136
01:22:24,651 --> 01:22:27,017
<i>- Riedenschneider was seen there.
- That's 4717?</i>

1137
01:22:27,187 --> 01:22:28,484
Yeah.

1138
01:22:28,655 --> 01:22:31,624
Stake your men out before
you go in. Get a move on.

1139
01:22:31,792 --> 01:22:33,054
Some news just came in.

1140
01:22:33,226 --> 01:22:36,957
A patrolman was on duty at the car barn.
He ran into two men and was slugged.

1141
01:22:37,130 --> 01:22:39,690
They got away, but he identified one
as Riedenschneider.

1142
01:22:39,866 --> 01:22:42,334
Good. Great.
We'll block off the whole area.

1143
01:22:42,502 --> 01:22:45,938
No sirens. We'll make it a sneak.
How about the patrolman? Badly hurt?

1144
01:22:46,206 --> 01:22:47,833
A head wound and he's punchy.

1145
01:22:48,008 --> 01:22:50,135
The doctor doesn't
think he's got a fracture.

1146
01:22:50,310 --> 01:22:53,768
Well, son, looks like maybe
we're getting somewhere at last.

1147
01:22:55,182 --> 01:22:57,707
Look, lieutenant,
what would I know about Belletier's?

1148
01:22:57,884 --> 01:22:59,977
I wouldn't mix into a robbery.
You know that.

1149
01:23:00,153 --> 01:23:01,950
- Wouldn't you?
- No, of course not!

1150
01:23:02,122 --> 01:23:04,147
You saw Riedenschneider here, sure.

1151
01:23:04,324 --> 01:23:05,814
- That don't say...
- You're nuts.

1152
01:23:05,992 --> 01:23:07,391
Never seen anybody here.

1153
01:23:07,561 --> 01:23:11,053
How could I?
I never been here before this.

1154
01:23:12,299 --> 01:23:14,790
Well, that being the case...

1155
01:23:14,968 --> 01:23:17,300
...what's to connect me with the Belletier job?

1156
01:23:17,737 --> 01:23:19,534
Somebody saw him here.
I don't know who.

1157
01:23:19,706 --> 01:23:21,503
Maybe you got a fink around.

1158
01:23:24,177 --> 01:23:26,645
Look. You're sure you
won't have one, lieutenant?

1159
01:23:26,813 --> 01:23:28,303
No, thanks.

1160
01:23:28,482 --> 01:23:30,950
I never drink while on duty.
It's against regulations.

1161
01:23:31,117 --> 01:23:33,551
Look, I got nothing to hide.

1162
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:35,711
Riedenschneider holed up here.
He was broke.

1163
01:23:35,889 --> 01:23:38,119
I let him use one of the rooms
for a couple days.

1164
01:23:38,291 --> 01:23:42,193
I got tired of having him around.
I gave him a few bucks to get rid of him.

1165
01:23:42,362 --> 01:23:44,296
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.

1166
01:23:44,764 --> 01:23:46,163
I don't know.

1167
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:50,092
Look, Cobby, do you figure me
for a pal, or don't you?

1168
01:23:50,270 --> 01:23:51,567
I sure do, lieutenant.

1169
01:23:51,738 --> 01:23:53,535
Then take my advice and turn state's.

1170
01:23:53,707 --> 01:23:55,607
We'll make a deal with the commissioner.

1171
01:23:55,775 --> 01:23:59,302
- You won't get more than a year or two.
- Look, I'm clean.

1172
01:23:59,479 --> 01:24:01,572
I don't know where he went.
That's the truth.

1173
01:24:01,748 --> 01:24:03,682
They won't believe you at headquarters.

1174
01:24:03,850 --> 01:24:06,011
When you tell them that,
they'd work you over.

1175
01:24:06,186 --> 01:24:09,622
You ain't the type that can take it.
You'd spill your guts in a half-hour.

1176
01:24:15,562 --> 01:24:17,553
Give me a break.

1177
01:24:17,931 --> 01:24:20,331
You came to make a pinch, sure.
But I'm not here.

1178
01:24:20,867 --> 01:24:23,097
I had to go to Chi on business.

1179
01:24:24,771 --> 01:24:26,033
You're right here, Cobby.

1180
01:24:26,606 --> 01:24:29,097
I've always treated you right, lieutenant.

1181
01:24:29,276 --> 01:24:31,005
Let me duck out.

1182
01:24:31,478 --> 01:24:34,106
- You can get away with it.
- No, I couldn't.

1183
01:24:34,281 --> 01:24:36,476
The commissioner's mad.
He's out for blood.

1184
01:24:36,650 --> 01:24:39,175
And it's not going to be mine.

1185
01:24:40,587 --> 01:24:42,020
You're not gonna stop me!

1186
01:24:42,188 --> 01:24:44,588
You're gonna let me go!
You're gonna do that!

1187
01:24:44,758 --> 01:24:46,020
If you don't...

1188
01:24:46,192 --> 01:24:48,251
Yeah, I know.

1189
01:24:48,428 --> 01:24:50,020
You'll be a Grade A pigeon.

1190
01:24:50,196 --> 01:24:53,688
That's right. I'll tell them
you saw Riedenschneider here...

1191
01:24:53,867 --> 01:24:55,801
...and didn't roust him. Why?

1192
01:24:55,969 --> 01:24:58,369
You'd have to explain
what you were doing here.

1193
01:24:58,638 --> 01:25:00,970
I'll tell them about the juice
you've been getting.

1194
01:25:01,141 --> 01:25:03,234
The only thing you're doing
is making me sore.

1195
01:25:03,410 --> 01:25:05,241
Once I start singing, I won't stop!

1196
01:25:05,412 --> 01:25:07,243
They'll jug you right alongside of me!

1197
01:25:07,414 --> 01:25:08,813
That's where you're wrong.

1198
01:25:08,982 --> 01:25:11,507
Even if they believe you,
it won't go too hard with me.

1199
01:25:11,685 --> 01:25:15,416
Because I'll be the guy that cracked
the biggest case ever pulled in the country.

1200
01:25:16,122 --> 01:25:19,148
- You're gonna get hurt, Cobby.
- What, have you gone crazy?

1201
01:25:19,326 --> 01:25:20,918
Stand up!

1202
01:25:37,444 --> 01:25:39,708
I told you you couldn't take it, Cobby.

1203
01:25:39,879 --> 01:25:41,369
Here.

1204
01:25:46,486 --> 01:25:48,351
They'll call me a fink.

1205
01:25:48,521 --> 01:25:50,352
That's my boy.

1206
01:25:55,962 --> 01:25:59,625
So since I'm gonna be
busy with a lot of cases...

1207
01:25:59,799 --> 01:26:02,131
...you might like to take a trip.
- Where to?

1208
01:26:02,302 --> 01:26:04,702
I don't know. The coast, Florida.
Anywhere you like.

1209
01:26:04,871 --> 01:26:07,772
Could I, Uncle Lon?
Anywhere? No fooling?

1210
01:26:07,941 --> 01:26:11,138
Yes. I think a change of scenery
might be good for you.

1211
01:26:11,311 --> 01:26:15,179
Wait. You wait right here.
I've got the most terrific idea.

1212
01:26:22,322 --> 01:26:25,257
Oh, Cuba. There, that's not a bad idea.

1213
01:26:25,425 --> 01:26:28,861
Imagine me on this beach here
in my green bathing suit.

1214
01:26:29,596 --> 01:26:32,326
I almost bought a white one,
but it wasn't extreme enough.

1215
01:26:32,499 --> 01:26:36,526
If I really went in for the extreme extreme,
I would have bought a French one.

1216
01:26:36,703 --> 01:26:39,103
Run for your lives, girls.
The fleet's in.

1217
01:26:39,272 --> 01:26:42,070
Oh, Uncle Lon, am I excited!

1218
01:26:44,310 --> 01:26:48,178
Look, Uncle Lon. Isn't it romantic?
Real palms and ocean and everything!

1219
01:26:50,517 --> 01:26:52,610
Who can that be this time of night?

1220
01:26:54,788 --> 01:26:56,949
See who it is, Uncle Lon.

1221
01:26:59,325 --> 01:27:01,555
Why are they pounding so?

1222
01:27:01,995 --> 01:27:04,429
I'm scared, Uncle Lon.

1223
01:27:10,804 --> 01:27:13,898
Well, young man,
you've got an iron fist...

1224
01:27:14,074 --> 01:27:15,871
Oh, hello, Hardy. Come in.

1225
01:27:23,650 --> 01:27:27,177
Well, there's a fire in here.
Come on in. You look cold.

1226
01:27:37,464 --> 01:27:39,762
I'm here to arrest you, Emmerich.

1227
01:27:43,970 --> 01:27:46,063
May I ask what for?

1228
01:27:46,239 --> 01:27:49,902
Complicity in robbery and in murder.

1229
01:27:50,810 --> 01:27:54,075
If I were you, Hardy,
I'd think up a few more charges.

1230
01:27:54,247 --> 01:27:56,306
You might make one of them stand up...

1231
01:27:56,483 --> 01:28:00,180
...if you get an imbecile jury
and the right judge.

1232
01:28:00,587 --> 01:28:03,385
- Get the young lady.
- Yes, sir.

1233
01:28:06,326 --> 01:28:10,285
It may interest you to know that your
friend Cobb has signed a confession.

1234
01:28:11,364 --> 01:28:14,299
Want to take a look at it? Here.

1235
01:28:23,777 --> 01:28:27,440
Okay, miss. It's a shame to bust
this door in, but here goes.

1236
01:28:27,614 --> 01:28:30,048
Haven't you bothered me enough,
you big banana-head?

1237
01:28:30,216 --> 01:28:33,583
Just try breaking my door,
and Mr. Emmerich will throw you out.

1238
01:28:33,887 --> 01:28:36,913
Afraid not, miss.
He's got troubles enough.

1239
01:28:37,090 --> 01:28:39,024
As a matter of fact, he's a dead duck.

1240
01:28:39,192 --> 01:28:41,353
Hurry up, Andrews.
Bring the young lady in here.

1241
01:28:43,029 --> 01:28:45,156
Do I have to talk to him?

1242
01:28:46,132 --> 01:28:48,896
Couldn't I just talk to you?

1243
01:28:49,969 --> 01:28:51,459
Come on, baby.

1244
01:28:51,805 --> 01:28:53,636
Get it over with.

1245
01:28:54,774 --> 01:28:57,641
And be smart.
Tell the commissioner the truth.

1246
01:28:58,311 --> 01:29:00,040
That's the only thing to do.

1247
01:29:00,980 --> 01:29:02,948
Come on.

1248
01:29:10,890 --> 01:29:12,517
Sit down.

1249
01:29:12,792 --> 01:29:16,558
Andrews, repeat the statement Miss Phinlay
made before you yesterday afternoon.

1250
01:29:16,729 --> 01:29:22,531
She said Mr. Emmerich was here with her
from 11:30 p.m. To 3 a.m. Last Friday night.

1251
01:29:22,702 --> 01:29:24,966
Is that the statement you made?

1252
01:29:25,338 --> 01:29:28,068
- Yes, sir.
- Was it the truth?

1253
01:29:33,646 --> 01:29:35,375
You better think before you answer...

1254
01:29:35,548 --> 01:29:38,073
...unless you wanna go to jail.
- Jail?

1255
01:29:38,251 --> 01:29:42,244
For setting up a false alibi to keep
another from being punished for a crime.

1256
01:29:43,289 --> 01:29:46,918
- Mr. Emmerich wouldn't commit a crime.
- He would and did.

1257
01:29:50,496 --> 01:29:51,758
Tell him the truth.

1258
01:29:52,866 --> 01:29:54,731
- Uncle Lon.
- It's the only thing to do...

1259
01:29:54,901 --> 01:29:57,699
...unless you want to be indicted
for obstructing justice.

1260
01:29:57,871 --> 01:30:00,203
<i>What I said yesterday was...</i>

1261
01:30:01,107 --> 01:30:03,166
Well, it wasn't exactly...

1262
01:30:03,343 --> 01:30:04,605
I mean...

1263
01:30:05,478 --> 01:30:07,412
- It wasn't really the...
- Was it the truth?

1264
01:30:08,448 --> 01:30:09,710
No, sir.

1265
01:30:09,883 --> 01:30:12,113
- You weren't with Emmerich, were you?
- No, sir.

1266
01:30:12,285 --> 01:30:15,743
- You were someplace else, not with him.
- Yes, sir.

1267
01:30:15,922 --> 01:30:18,390
He told you what to say,
made you learn it by heart.

1268
01:30:20,493 --> 01:30:22,484
Answer me!

1269
01:30:22,929 --> 01:30:24,760
I mean, yes, sir!

1270
01:30:24,931 --> 01:30:26,558
I mean, I learned it by heart!

1271
01:30:28,368 --> 01:30:31,098
Get a new statement from her.
Have her sign it.

1272
01:30:31,271 --> 01:30:33,466
This time, young lady,
I want the whole truth.

1273
01:30:34,540 --> 01:30:36,030
Over here, miss.

1274
01:30:41,481 --> 01:30:43,972
I'm sorry, Uncle Lon.

1275
01:30:44,150 --> 01:30:46,414
I tried.

1276
01:30:46,586 --> 01:30:49,487
You did pretty well, considering.

1277
01:30:52,058 --> 01:30:55,619
What about my trip, Uncle Lon?
Is it still on?

1278
01:30:56,362 --> 01:30:58,956
Don't worry, baby.
You'll have plenty of trips.

1279
01:31:04,137 --> 01:31:05,934
Seems to be all wrapped up, Emmerich.

1280
01:31:09,008 --> 01:31:10,805
Oh, here.

1281
01:31:10,977 --> 01:31:14,435
Say, I'd like to telephone my wife,
if you don't mind.

1282
01:31:14,614 --> 01:31:16,377
Getting late. She might be worried.

1283
01:31:16,549 --> 01:31:19,746
Help yourself. But don't try to run.
You won't get very far.

1284
01:32:18,745 --> 01:32:20,337
Emmerich!

1285
01:32:46,139 --> 01:32:48,403
- Stop! Stop!
- Come on!

1286
01:32:48,574 --> 01:32:50,439
- You wait and see...
- Break loose!

1287
01:32:50,610 --> 01:32:53,511
You dirty fink. You're gonna
wind up where you belong.

1288
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:57,115
You're gonna wind up in the morgue!
You wait and see, you dirty fink!

1289
01:32:57,283 --> 01:32:58,978
Home of the pigeons!

1290
01:32:59,152 --> 01:33:00,710
Fink! Fink!

1291
01:33:05,625 --> 01:33:07,320
Fire escape.

1292
01:33:15,168 --> 01:33:16,795
We're looking for Louis Ciavelli.

1293
01:33:23,709 --> 01:33:26,610
I'd consider it a great favor
if you didn't insist on going in.

1294
01:33:26,779 --> 01:33:30,180
Mrs. Ciavelli is, well,
I don't have to tell you.

1295
01:33:30,349 --> 01:33:32,909
If the father says it's okay,
Williams, it's okay.

1296
01:33:33,086 --> 01:33:36,055
- Call the commissioner's office.
- The commissioner knows me.

1297
01:33:36,222 --> 01:33:39,191
- Mention my name. Sortino.
- Thank you, Father.

1298
01:33:39,358 --> 01:33:42,384
"Emmerich was a graduate of
the law college of State University...

1299
01:33:42,562 --> 01:33:45,224
...and had practiced here for over 25 years."

1300
01:33:45,398 --> 01:33:47,263
What foolishness. Unbelievable.

1301
01:33:47,433 --> 01:33:49,424
He wouldn't have gotten
more than two years.

1302
01:33:49,602 --> 01:33:52,230
He even double-crossed himself.
How's your head, Doc?

1303
01:33:52,405 --> 01:33:55,203
Good as it ever was,
which isn't saying much.

1304
01:33:55,374 --> 01:33:58,468
You know, getting out of town's
not gonna be a cinch for you.

1305
01:33:58,644 --> 01:34:00,976
Oh, I'll get out, all right.

1306
01:34:01,147 --> 01:34:05,277
I'll take a taxi to the edge of town,
then have him drive me as far as Cleveland.

1307
01:34:06,185 --> 01:34:08,813
Sure you wouldn't come along with me, Dix?

1308
01:34:09,088 --> 01:34:10,783
Keep it.

1309
01:34:11,357 --> 01:34:12,722
No, thank you.

1310
01:34:12,892 --> 01:34:14,917
If you won't come, will you finance me?

1311
01:34:15,094 --> 01:34:17,585
I haven't got but 4 or 5 dollars.

1312
01:34:17,763 --> 01:34:19,890
Sure, I'll finance you.
How much you need?

1313
01:34:20,066 --> 01:34:23,001
I can get along on $ 1000,
thanks very much.

1314
01:34:23,169 --> 01:34:25,103
And you can have the rest of these stones.

1315
01:34:25,271 --> 01:34:27,102
That's $50,000 worth.

1316
01:34:27,273 --> 01:34:30,868
What would I do? Can you see me
walking into a hockshop with that stuff?

1317
01:34:31,043 --> 01:34:34,535
First they'd think they were phony,
then they'd yell for the riot squad.

1318
01:34:34,714 --> 01:34:37,148
No. You can have the thousand,
but no rocks for me.

1319
01:34:37,817 --> 01:34:40,377
Well, thank you, Dix.

1320
01:34:41,954 --> 01:34:46,015
Tell me where to write you. At least I can
send you the 5 grand you got coming.

1321
01:34:46,192 --> 01:34:48,752
- What will your address be in Kentucky?
- Forget it.

1322
01:34:49,028 --> 01:34:50,655
Maybe I'll see you around.

1323
01:34:50,830 --> 01:34:52,297
Well...

1324
01:34:54,066 --> 01:34:56,660
...goodbye, then.
- Goodbye, Doc.

1325
01:34:57,603 --> 01:34:59,298
Hey, wait. You haven't got a heater.

1326
01:34:59,472 --> 01:35:01,963
I'd let you have mine,
but you got a gun, Doll?

1327
01:35:02,141 --> 01:35:05,167
No, Dix. I used to have one around,
but I guess somebody stole it.

1328
01:35:05,344 --> 01:35:06,572
I don't want a gun.

1329
01:35:06,746 --> 01:35:10,842
I haven't carried a gun since my 20s.
You carry a gun, you shoot a policeman.

1330
01:35:11,017 --> 01:35:12,507
Bad rap, hard to beat.

1331
01:35:12,685 --> 01:35:15,586
You don't carry a gun,
you give up and they hold one on you.

1332
01:35:15,788 --> 01:35:17,847
All right, Doc. You know best.

1333
01:35:33,105 --> 01:35:35,096
How about a cup of coffee, honey?

1334
01:35:35,274 --> 01:35:37,834
That squarehead.
He's a funny little guy.

1335
01:35:38,244 --> 01:35:39,734
I don't get him at all.

1336
01:35:39,912 --> 01:35:42,972
Maybe it's because he's a foreigner.
They just don't think like us.

1337
01:35:43,149 --> 01:35:45,083
I gotta get out of town too,
before morning.

1338
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:48,516
Anyway, he's got plenty of guts.

1339
01:35:50,189 --> 01:35:53,124
- How about a cup of coffee, honey?
- Make it or shut up about it.

1340
01:35:53,292 --> 01:35:55,351
- It's that wound.
- Bright girl.

1341
01:35:55,528 --> 01:35:58,691
Dix, it's starting to bleed again.
I know, aspirin.

1342
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:17,043
Pickering Avenue and Center Street.
You know where that is?

1343
01:36:17,216 --> 01:36:19,377
- The other side of town.
- How far is that?

1344
01:36:19,552 --> 01:36:22,544
- I can make it in an hour.
- Okay. I got relatives living there.

1345
01:36:22,722 --> 01:36:24,781
I'm between trains.
I got nothing else to do.

1346
01:36:24,957 --> 01:36:27,721
I know how it is.
I got relatives myself, on both sides.

1347
01:36:29,262 --> 01:36:30,923
Always writing me letters for money.

1348
01:36:34,233 --> 01:36:36,326
I haven't spoken German for a long time.

1349
01:36:36,502 --> 01:36:38,800
<i>- You have a Mnchen accent.
- I was born there.</i>

1350
01:36:38,971 --> 01:36:41,371
You know what they say,
"Home is where the money is."

1351
01:36:41,540 --> 01:36:42,973
- Yeah.
- Franz?

1352
01:36:43,142 --> 01:36:46,202
- Would you drive me to Cleveland?
- It's a long way, my friend.

1353
01:36:46,379 --> 01:36:48,847
But it would still be quicker
than to take the train.

1354
01:36:49,015 --> 01:36:51,449
- What about your relatives?
- Forget them.

1355
01:36:51,951 --> 01:36:54,511
Well, I don't know.
Cleveland, that's a long way.

1356
01:36:55,121 --> 01:36:57,817
- Costs a lot of money.
- There's a $50 tip for you.

1357
01:36:57,990 --> 01:37:01,756
- What do you say?
- For $50, I'd drive you to the North Pole.

1358
01:37:01,927 --> 01:37:04,418
Well, we better get gas
if we're going to Cleveland.

1359
01:37:04,597 --> 01:37:06,622
Let's not stop.
Wait till we get out of town.

1360
01:37:06,799 --> 01:37:08,130
We can do everything at once.

1361
01:37:08,301 --> 01:37:11,498
Have a little meal, beer, a cigar.
Go in comfort.

1362
01:37:11,871 --> 01:37:13,532
You're a man who likes his pleasures.

1363
01:37:13,706 --> 01:37:17,301
Well, Franz, what else
is there in life, I ask you?

1364
01:37:27,186 --> 01:37:29,245
You've been gone two hours.
What happened?

1365
01:37:29,422 --> 01:37:31,583
It took time.
I was stopped twice, prowler cars.

1366
01:37:31,757 --> 01:37:34,157
The neighborhood's
crawling with coppers. Dix, you...

1367
01:37:34,327 --> 01:37:35,726
- Did you get a car?
- Yes.

1368
01:37:35,895 --> 01:37:38,386
Here's the change.
It only came to $400.

1369
01:37:38,564 --> 01:37:42,056
I got it from Big Vivian.
It's in pretty good shape, Dix, except...

1370
01:37:42,234 --> 01:37:43,565
- Did you put gas in it?
- Yes.

1371
01:37:43,736 --> 01:37:45,533
- Where is it parked?
- Three blocks away.

1372
01:37:45,705 --> 01:37:47,002
- Good girl.
- Dix.

1373
01:37:47,173 --> 01:37:49,004
- Yeah?
- I'm scared.

1374
01:37:49,175 --> 01:37:50,802
All those cops out there.

1375
01:37:50,976 --> 01:37:52,273
They don't worry me one bit.

1376
01:37:52,445 --> 01:37:55,881
I'll drive slow. Head down
the main boulevard, and in 10 hours...

1377
01:37:56,048 --> 01:37:57,345
...I'll be home.

1378
01:37:57,516 --> 01:37:59,347
How are you gonna drive all that way?

1379
01:37:59,518 --> 01:38:00,815
- I'll make it.
- No!

1380
01:38:00,986 --> 01:38:03,011
Not in the shape you're in.

1381
01:38:03,189 --> 01:38:04,918
- I'll make it!
- Dix.

1382
01:38:06,525 --> 01:38:08,049
Let me go with you?

1383
01:38:08,361 --> 01:38:09,623
Please, Dix. Please.

1384
01:38:09,795 --> 01:38:12,559
Are you crazy? I'm on the lam.
I'm wanted bad, packing heat.

1385
01:38:12,732 --> 01:38:14,962
- What good would you be?
- I could drive!

1386
01:38:16,669 --> 01:38:18,830
No, Doll. I'm wanted on a killing rap.

1387
01:38:19,004 --> 01:38:21,165
I don't care.
I just want to be with you.

1388
01:38:23,776 --> 01:38:26,336
You can't go without me.
I won't let you.

1389
01:38:27,046 --> 01:38:29,446
I won't tell you where the car is.

1390
01:38:34,186 --> 01:38:35,619
I don't get it.

1391
01:38:36,555 --> 01:38:38,182
I just don't get it.

1392
01:38:40,159 --> 01:38:42,491
All right, kid. Get your things packed.

1393
01:39:09,422 --> 01:39:10,821
Come on, let's play some more.

1394
01:39:10,990 --> 01:39:13,254
I'm fresh out of nickels, Jeannie.
How about you?

1395
01:39:13,426 --> 01:39:15,519
- I'm always fresh out.
- Well, get some.

1396
01:39:15,694 --> 01:39:17,753
You know, you can cost a guy
a lot of dough.

1397
01:39:17,930 --> 01:39:20,398
Nickels he's complaining about.
What a spender.

1398
01:39:20,966 --> 01:39:23,298
Sure, he wants a date.
He always wants a date.

1399
01:39:23,469 --> 01:39:26,097
And where do we go?
To a third-run movie.

1400
01:39:26,272 --> 01:39:28,399
Then we take a ride and blow two tires.

1401
01:39:28,574 --> 01:39:31,407
Then we come in here,
and what do you treat me to? Cokes.

1402
01:39:32,411 --> 01:39:34,003
- That's for you.
- Thanks.

1403
01:39:34,180 --> 01:39:37,240
- Would you have change for this in nickels?
- Sure thing.

1404
01:39:37,416 --> 01:39:40,010
At least you could dig for enough
to play me some music.

1405
01:39:40,186 --> 01:39:41,813
Jeannie, cut it out.

1406
01:39:41,987 --> 01:39:43,716
Excuse me, boys.

1407
01:39:43,889 --> 01:39:46,881
Young lady, I like music too.

1408
01:39:48,461 --> 01:39:51,123
- Would you play me a tune?
- Sure. What do you want?

1409
01:39:51,297 --> 01:39:53,595
- You pick them.
- Gosh, how many have you got here?

1410
01:39:53,766 --> 01:39:57,327
- Not very many. Play what you like.
- Okay.

1411
01:40:51,390 --> 01:40:52,914
Mister.

1412
01:40:54,059 --> 01:40:56,755
Mister. It's getting late.

1413
01:40:59,498 --> 01:41:01,398
Mister, we better be moving along.

1414
01:41:01,567 --> 01:41:05,025
Plenty of time, my friend. Plenty of time.

1415
01:41:09,975 --> 01:41:12,773
Look, mister, it's a long way to Cleveland.

1416
01:41:16,715 --> 01:41:19,377
Well, I suppose we better go now.

1417
01:41:19,552 --> 01:41:22,316
- Don't go. We haven't used all the nickels.
- You use them.

1418
01:41:22,488 --> 01:41:24,820
- Thanks. It's sure nice of you.
- Don't mention it.

1419
01:41:24,990 --> 01:41:27,424
Goodbye and thanks.
Thanks ever so much.

1420
01:41:27,593 --> 01:41:29,527
Pleasure was all mine.

1421
01:41:51,216 --> 01:41:53,480
You men want something?

1422
01:41:53,652 --> 01:41:55,381
What do you think, Ed?

1423
01:41:55,554 --> 01:41:57,954
Might be the number-one boy.

1424
01:41:58,123 --> 01:41:59,715
- Just might be.
- Say, what is this?

1425
01:41:59,892 --> 01:42:01,655
- Shut up.
- Better frisk him.

1426
01:42:01,827 --> 01:42:03,692
- Go right ahead.
- Put up your hands.

1427
01:42:03,862 --> 01:42:05,727
You have me mixed up with somebody else.

1428
01:42:05,898 --> 01:42:08,799
I'm from Cleveland, the importing business.
My name's Kremper.

1429
01:42:08,968 --> 01:42:10,833
Nothing there.
Let me see that coat.

1430
01:42:11,003 --> 01:42:13,267
- You're making a big...
- Shut up. Stay out of this.

1431
01:42:13,439 --> 01:42:16,670
Bill, better phone the city
and check on the description.

1432
01:42:19,244 --> 01:42:20,836
We don't need a description.

1433
01:42:21,013 --> 01:42:22,446
I'll tell them we got him.

1434
01:42:25,517 --> 01:42:28,611
- Okay, mister. Keep those hands up.
- Of course.

1435
01:42:28,787 --> 01:42:31,483
Excuse me, officer,
but will you tell me something?

1436
01:42:31,657 --> 01:42:33,921
Maybe. Just keep your face front.

1437
01:42:34,093 --> 01:42:35,856
How long have you been out here?

1438
01:42:36,028 --> 01:42:39,020
- That's a darn funny question.
- It's not important.

1439
01:42:39,198 --> 01:42:42,224
We've been watching you
through that window two, three minutes.

1440
01:42:42,401 --> 01:42:46,132
Yes. Say, about as long as it takes
to play a phonograph record.

1441
01:42:46,305 --> 01:42:48,432
How's that again?
What are you talking about?

1442
01:42:48,607 --> 01:42:50,837
- It doesn't matter.
- Keep your face front.

1443
01:42:51,010 --> 01:42:52,978
You mind if I smoke a cigar?

1444
01:42:53,145 --> 01:42:57,013
Just stand quiet there, mister.
We'll talk about smoking a cigar later.

1445
01:42:57,182 --> 01:42:59,742
Certainly, officer. Certainly.

1446
01:43:05,357 --> 01:43:07,257
How you feeling now, Dix?

1447
01:43:07,426 --> 01:43:10,862
All right. Cold.
Didn't used to get cold this time of year.

1448
01:43:14,733 --> 01:43:17,167
Why don't you let me drive
for a while, honey.

1449
01:43:17,336 --> 01:43:18,769
You don't know the way.

1450
01:43:18,937 --> 01:43:21,371
I don't wanna have to keep telling you.

1451
01:43:21,874 --> 01:43:23,501
Much longer, Dix?

1452
01:43:23,676 --> 01:43:26,474
Dix. Dix.

1453
01:43:26,645 --> 01:43:27,907
Dix!

1454
01:43:39,258 --> 01:43:40,816
Dix.

1455
01:43:56,442 --> 01:43:58,433
Mister! Mister!

1456
01:43:58,610 --> 01:44:00,510
Mister!

1457
01:44:01,180 --> 01:44:03,307
You gotta help me.
I gotta find a doctor.

1458
01:44:03,482 --> 01:44:04,881
My husband, he's sick.

1459
01:44:05,050 --> 01:44:06,278
Come on. I'll show you.

1460
01:44:06,452 --> 01:44:09,148
Go straight on, ma'am.
Down to the end of the block.

1461
01:44:09,321 --> 01:44:13,348
We'll get Doc Swanson.
He lives right near here, on Elm Street.

1462
01:44:31,677 --> 01:44:33,474
My husband, he's sick. Save him!

1463
01:44:33,645 --> 01:44:38,139
Get him inside here where I can look at him.
Right in this other room here, please.

1464
01:44:41,820 --> 01:44:43,549
On the table.

1465
01:44:43,722 --> 01:44:45,485
Take his coat off.

1466
01:44:49,094 --> 01:44:50,755
On the chair.

1467
01:45:10,516 --> 01:45:13,747
This man's been hemorrhaging.
He's lost a lot of blood. What happened?

1468
01:45:13,919 --> 01:45:16,251
He was hurt.
He was hurt in an auto accident.

1469
01:45:16,421 --> 01:45:19,652
- How long has this wound been let go?
- A couple of days.

1470
01:45:19,825 --> 01:45:22,953
Is it bad, doctor?
Is he hurt real bad?

1471
01:45:23,128 --> 01:45:25,028
It's not good.

1472
01:45:27,533 --> 01:45:30,127
- You got a good, strong arm?
- Good as any, Doc, I guess.

1473
01:45:30,302 --> 01:45:32,827
Come around here
and hold this for me, please.

1474
01:45:35,307 --> 01:45:37,070
That's right.

1475
01:45:38,877 --> 01:45:40,310
There we are.

1476
01:45:49,154 --> 01:45:54,114
Hello. Let me talk to Tom.
This is Dr. Swanson. Well, wake him up!

1477
01:45:56,261 --> 01:45:58,923
- I'm thirsty. Get me a drink of water.
- Sure, Dix. Sure.

1478
01:45:59,097 --> 01:46:02,760
Lie down, sweetheart. Please lie down.

1479
01:46:03,535 --> 01:46:05,002
Hello, sheriff.

1480
01:46:05,170 --> 01:46:08,469
This is Tom. I got a man here
with a gunshot wound. Pretty bad.

1481
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:11,074
- Here, sweetheart.
- Who's that?

1482
01:46:11,243 --> 01:46:14,542
I had to take you to the doctor's, Dix.
I couldn't help it.

1483
01:46:14,713 --> 01:46:17,682
Hold him? I don't have to.
The man's unconscious.

1484
01:46:18,250 --> 01:46:20,377
No, no, no. He's a stranger to me.

1485
01:46:20,552 --> 01:46:24,113
His wife's with him.
She says it was an auto accident.

1486
01:46:25,791 --> 01:46:27,224
Dix.

1487
01:46:29,962 --> 01:46:32,328
Dix. Dix!

1488
01:46:44,543 --> 01:46:47,011
Well, he won't get very far,
that's for sure.

1489
01:46:47,179 --> 01:46:50,580
He hasn't got enough blood left in him
to keep a chicken alive.

1490
01:46:51,783 --> 01:46:54,684
- Any more questions?
- I don't like to harp on the same point...

1491
01:46:54,853 --> 01:46:57,515
...but what about Ditrich?
If the past of the department...

1492
01:46:57,689 --> 01:47:00,715
He's in jail and he'll go to trial.
He'll be tried by 12 citizens.

1493
01:47:00,893 --> 01:47:04,590
The people he's worked for. Let them
show justice or compassion as they see fit.

1494
01:47:04,763 --> 01:47:07,891
- What would be your verdict, commissioner?
- I'm not sure.

1495
01:47:08,066 --> 01:47:10,933
I'm not sure at all.
Let me put it this way.

1496
01:47:11,103 --> 01:47:15,233
It's not anything strange that there
are corrupt officers in police departments.

1497
01:47:15,407 --> 01:47:19,036
The dirt they're trying to clean up
is bound to rub off on some, but not all.

1498
01:47:19,211 --> 01:47:20,644
Maybe one out of 100.

1499
01:47:20,812 --> 01:47:24,748
The other 99 are honest men
trying to do an honest job.

1500
01:47:26,118 --> 01:47:28,484
<i>- Robbery at 193 Scully Avenue.
- Listen.</i>

1501
01:47:28,654 --> 01:47:30,383
<i>All units, robbery at 193...</i>

1502
01:47:30,555 --> 01:47:33,080
<i>- two male Caucasians,
armed with blue steel...</i>

1503
01:47:33,258 --> 01:47:35,818
I know you're police reporters
and hear this all day...

1504
01:47:35,994 --> 01:47:38,656
...but listen with your conscience,
not just your ears.

1505
01:47:38,830 --> 01:47:40,764
<i>- wearing a brown felt hat...</i>

1506
01:47:40,933 --> 01:47:43,424
<i>- a shooting at 25 James Boulevard.
Woman screaming.</i>

1507
01:47:43,602 --> 01:47:46,696
<i>Car 12, shooting at
25 James Boulevard. Woman...</i>

1508
01:47:46,872 --> 01:47:49,773
<i>All units, strong-arm slugging,
3216 River Drive...</i>

1509
01:47:49,942 --> 01:47:52,274
We send police assistance
to each of those calls...

1510
01:47:52,444 --> 01:47:55,902
...because they're not just codes
on a radio, they're cries for help.

1511
01:47:56,081 --> 01:47:59,847
People are being cheated,
robbed, murdered, raped.

1512
01:48:00,018 --> 01:48:04,114
And that goes on 24 hours a day,
every day in the year.

1513
01:48:04,289 --> 01:48:06,553
And that's not exceptional, that's usual.

1514
01:48:06,725 --> 01:48:09,489
It's the same in every city
of the modern world.

1515
01:48:09,661 --> 01:48:12,528
But suppose we had no police force,
good or bad.

1516
01:48:12,698 --> 01:48:14,598
Suppose we had...

1517
01:48:17,169 --> 01:48:18,966
...just silence.

1518
01:48:19,137 --> 01:48:21,128
Nobody to listen. Nobody to answer.

1519
01:48:21,473 --> 01:48:24,340
The battle's finished.
The jungle wins.

1520
01:48:24,509 --> 01:48:26,670
The predatory beasts take over.

1521
01:48:26,845 --> 01:48:28,540
Think about it.

1522
01:48:29,848 --> 01:48:31,713
Well, gentlemen...

1523
01:48:31,883 --> 01:48:36,650
...three men are in jail, three men dead, one
by his own hand. One man's a fugitive...

1524
01:48:36,822 --> 01:48:39,347
...and we have reason to believe
seriously wounded.

1525
01:48:39,524 --> 01:48:42,015
That's six out of seven. Not bad.

1526
01:48:42,194 --> 01:48:44,025
And we'll get the last one too.

1527
01:48:44,329 --> 01:48:47,093
In some ways,
he's the most dangerous of them all.

1528
01:48:47,265 --> 01:48:50,063
A hardened killer. A hooligan.

1529
01:48:50,235 --> 01:48:53,864
A man without human feeling or human mercy.

1530
01:49:25,003 --> 01:49:26,868
I tell you...

1531
01:49:27,039 --> 01:49:30,998
...the black one's the best
we ever had at Hickorywood.

1532
01:49:31,443 --> 01:49:33,070
The bay's all right, but...

1533
01:49:33,245 --> 01:49:36,646
...the black's a real good colt.

1534
01:49:37,249 --> 01:49:40,844
Prettiest way of...
Going of... Anything...

1535
01:49:41,586 --> 01:49:43,611
...Pa ever bred.

1536
01:49:44,456 --> 01:49:46,390
Easiest thing...

1537
01:49:46,558 --> 01:49:49,857
...but he's always way out front...

1538
01:49:50,028 --> 01:49:51,996
...of the other yearlings.

1539
01:49:53,198 --> 01:49:54,927
He's a stake horse...

1540
01:49:55,100 --> 01:49:57,261
...or I never saw one.

1541
01:49:57,669 --> 01:49:59,569
I sure hope...

1542
01:50:00,505 --> 01:50:02,496
...Pa don't sell him.

1543
01:50:05,110 --> 01:50:08,511
If Pa just hangs on to that black colt...

1544
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:12,343
...everything's gonna be all right.
- Oh, Dix. God!

1545
01:50:12,918 --> 01:50:14,215
I said it.

1546
01:50:14,386 --> 01:50:15,876
I'll say it again.

1547
01:50:16,054 --> 01:50:19,581
If Pa just hangs on to that black colt...

1548
01:50:19,758 --> 01:50:23,194
...everything's gonna be okay.

1549
01:50:33,071 --> 01:50:34,732
What's this...?

1550
01:51:04,202 --> 01:51:06,397
Oh, Dix!

1551
01:51:12,177 --> 01:51:13,610
Dix! Dix!

1552
01:51:13,778 --> 01:51:16,542
Oh, God. Oh, my God, Dix.

1553
01:51:16,715 --> 01:51:18,376
Dix.
