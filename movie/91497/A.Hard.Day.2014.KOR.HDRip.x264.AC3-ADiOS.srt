SHOWBOX/MEDIAPLEX presents
a AD406 and DASEPO CLUB production

2
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,460
A HARD DAY

3
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,040
I'm on my way asswipe!

4
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,510
How did you get out of there?

5
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,880
- Where are you?
- Forget it.

6
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,920
If you tell me where the key is
I can just hide it for you.

7
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,560
I have the key,
how many times must I tell you?!

8
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,860
When are they arriving?

9
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,860
The rat squad'll be here
within the hour.

10
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,900
Fine, get off my ass.

11
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,690
I'll be there soon,
don't touch my stuff.

12
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,820
So get here ASAP.

13
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,030
Got another call.

14
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,260
When will you be back?

15
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,140
The elders are upset that
head of the family is gone.

16
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,940
I wouldn't have left the funeral
if it wasn't serious.

17
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:52,880
What's going on?

18
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,710
I'll be there soon,
so sit tight with your hubby.

19
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,280
So much for passing off
as a good son.

20
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,650
Just get here quick!

21
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,920
How's Mina?
What's she doing?

22
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,850
Your kid's fine!

23
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,560
Hey... sis...

24
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,860
What a fucking day!

25
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,140
That fucking mutt...

26
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,760
Hey mister.

27
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,490
Mister.

28
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,400
Hey!

29
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,190
Goddammit!

30
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,000
EMERGENCY CALL

31
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:00,900
SISTER

32
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,740
Yeah, what?

33
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,840
Daddy! Whatcha doing?

34
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,380
Hey Mina... Sweetie...

35
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,350
- Did you buy the cake?
- What?

36
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,120
Huh? What?
Yeah, that...

37
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,280
You promised,
a chocolate cake!

38
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,190
Right, a chocolate cake.

39
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,790
Did buy it yet?

40
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,660
- Daddy?
- Sweetie...

41
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,320
I'll call you back!

42
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,100
Dammit...

43
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,120
Jesus Christ...

44
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,270
Evening.
DUI checkpoint, sir.

45
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,210
- DUI check.
- Evening, officer.

46
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,140
I...

47
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,490
I'm Western District Homicide
Det. Ko Gun-su...

48
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,890
Northern District
officer Lee Dong-yun.

49
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,120
I see, thanks for your work.

50
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,420
Keep at it,
thanks bud.

51
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,160
Could you blow into this?

52
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,730
What?

53
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,400
You drank? Didn't you?

54
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,340
You did.

55
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,280
It's my mother's funeral,
so I had a drink.

56
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,310
Can't you let me off the hook?

57
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,970
Give it a blow please.

58
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,020
My mother passed away.

59
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,890
I see,
one moment please.

60
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,190
- Officer Lee!
- Yeah, one sec.

61
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,780
Get out of the car!

62
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,980
Get out of the car now!

63
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,050
What is it?

64
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,210
He attempted to flee the scene.

65
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,950
Are you deaf?

66
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,350
Evening, officer!

67
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,130
I'm Western District Homicide
Det. Ko.

68
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,060
I had a sip
at my mother's funeral...

69
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,260
Couldn't I get a pass?

70
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,630
No ID, and he was
acting suspicious.

71
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,470
Officer Lee,
come on, man.

72
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,630
What's your ID number?

73
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,280
Come on, we're all cops here.

74
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,670
So what's your ID number?

75
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,450
760625-12653172

76
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,000
There's an extra number.

77
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,420
What?

78
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,560
There are 14 numbers,
ID consists of 13.

79
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,940
- Write it down properly.
- I am sir.

80
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,330
It's... 760625-1265...

81
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,240
Let's check with the database
in my car.

82
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,210
What for?
We're doing that right now.

83
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,610
Call my district and verify!

84
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,310
It'll be simpler that way.

85
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,550
Let's get it over with...
Hey, hey!

86
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,380
- Don't touch my car!
- You had an accident.

87
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,080
- Call and verify!
- Back off, sir.

88
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,290
Officer Choi, pop the trunk.

89
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,650
Yes, sir.

90
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,350
Hey! Stop it!

91
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,660
Don't you dare!

92
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,770
Let's just check the database...

93
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,360
What do you think you're doing?!

94
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,270
Grab him, grab him!

95
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,140
Let go, you son of a bitch!

96
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,070
Let go!

97
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,480
Fucking bitches!

98
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,370
Grab him, now!

99
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,290
Incoming radio from HQ.

100
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,060
Go ahead.

101
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,520
The ID is verified,
he's a Western Det. Ko.

102
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,340
How can you do this
to fellow cops, goddammit!

103
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,010
Open this drawer.

104
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,380
Why so many locks on this?

105
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,620
Is Det. Ko here?

106
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,150
He's mourning at the moment.

107
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,730
Hammer.

108
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,190
What's inside?

109
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,030
He said to leave it.

110
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,190
What?

111
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,190
You know his temper.

112
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,740
God-fucking-damn...

113
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,810
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all, sir.

114
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,370
You, come here.

115
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,210
Mr. 14-digit, come here!

116
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,780
Officer Shin Hyun-jin.

117
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,410
Fuck...

118
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,920
Buddy.

119
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,090
- Don't talk back, okay?
- Yes, sir!

120
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,560
- Watch it.
- Yes, sir!

121
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,180
What?

122
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,700
Sir, you should get
a designated driver...

123
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,710
No problem, good night!

124
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,840
Yo 14-digit!
It's all your fault!

125
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,650
Boys, that's enough!

126
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,260
You're all fucked.

127
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,270
What the hell happened here?!

128
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,540
What brings you here
past midnight?

129
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,440
You're accusing a mourner
over some money without context?

130
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,510
IAD isn't run by humans?

131
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,420
We're only following our orders.

132
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,510
Ship out.

133
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,320
Come back after the funeral.

134
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,450
Don't just stand there,
pack up!

135
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,590
This here is a list,

136
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,700
of those who took bribes
from local businesses.

137
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,500
I said pack up!

138
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,470
Doh Hee-chul, $1,000,

139
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,600
Choi Sang-ho, $3,500,
Ko Gun-su, $3,500,

140
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,140
and over 10 grand...

141
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,510
You're on a different level,
chief.

142
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,680
DET. CHOI - RAIDED BY THE IAD.
ANSWER THE DAMN PHONE!

143
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,790
SISTER

144
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,840
What? What now?

145
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,410
What's with you?!
What's taking so long?!

146
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,650
Just let me be!

147
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,650
Let you be?
Mom's getting prepped!

148
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,820
We need you here!
Get here now!

149
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,350
Fuck, everything's just perfect!

150
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,530
Daddy, your foot!

151
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,600
Hey, sweetie.

152
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,580
Why aren't you sleeping?

153
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,570
I already did.
Where's the cake?

154
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,400
Sorry, I...

155
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,380
I'll buy you next time, okay?

156
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,820
Mina, I'm sorry.
I...

157
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,640
Make room in the grave for us too.

158
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,240
I'm sorry sir.

159
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,510
Chief...

160
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,350
I'm sorry,
but could we do this later?

161
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,150
Yo, Ko Gun-su!

162
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:54,560
Shouldn't you at least pretend to
take some responsibility for this?

163
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,220
What?

164
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,200
Wait...

165
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,410
You want me to...

166
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,840
take the heat for you all?

167
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,210
While grieving?

168
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,520
What a fucking timing!

169
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,850
I'm sorry, we really are.

170
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,720
But we all can't go down.
This should end with you.

171
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,400
I'll take care of you,
so don't worry.

172
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,090
Take care of me?!
Cover your own ass!

173
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,830
You're not getting out of this!

174
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,700
Even your brothel trips
are on record!

175
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,560
'Ms. Autumn' is your regular, right?

176
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,400
Motherfucker, are you nuts?!

177
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,070
Yeah, fuckhead!
I wish I was mental!

178
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,850
- Fuck you man!
- Come at me!

179
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,980
- Hey, hey!
- Let's go!

180
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,710
Gun-su!

181
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,560
Mother's ready for casket.

182
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,300
My condolences.

183
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,200
Take care, sir.

184
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,640
License plate 2644,
please move your car.

185
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,710
It's designated for the hearse

186
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,990
Please do not park there.

187
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,750
The unit was raided,
couldn't even find an envelope.

188
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,590
Give her a good send off.

189
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,590
Insert any of her personal items
you'd like to put in.

190
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,440
We'll hammer the nails
in this order.

191
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,010
Mother!

192
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,460
DET. NAM:
RATS ARE HEADING THERE

193
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,590
MIGHT SEARCH THE CAR,
ANYTHING INSIDE?

194
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,070
- Mr. Ko?
- Yes?

195
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:14,030
License plate 2644,
please move your car.

196
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,510
CHAPEL OF THE REST

197
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,560
Where are you going?!

198
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,830
Gun-su!

199
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,570
What's that there?

200
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,970
Isn't that Gun-su?

201
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:05,940
What's with him?

202
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,640
Chief, let's dig into the IAD guys.

203
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,080
We need leverage.

204
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,080
I doubt there's anything,
they're IAD after all.

205
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,080
Come on, Internal Affairs is
still police.

206
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,560
Don't overestimate Korean cops.

207
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:26,900
Sir?

208
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:05,760
Sir, I'd like some private moment
with my mother one last time.

209
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,940
But...

210
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,340
that's rather unusual.

211
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,340
Okay.

212
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,680
- Until midnight.
- Thank you.

213
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,120
By the way,
what's that for?

214
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,130
These are for my daughter.

215
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,360
I see.

216
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,660
Thank you again.

217
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:02,730
I'm sorry, mom.

218
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,880
EFFECTIVE RANGE: 3M

219
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:27,890
Dammit!

220
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,720
Holy fuck...

221
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,600
Shit...

222
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,160
I'm a terrible son,
I'll make it up to you...

223
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,870
Anyone inside?

224
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,040
Did you hear that,
just now?

225
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,200
I'm not sure.

226
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,510
Security 1, security 1.

227
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,420
Yeah, this is the security office.

228
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,880
Could you check something
on the security feed?

229
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:18,920
I'm outside the chapel,
I got a report of disturbance.

230
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,580
Huh?
What the heck?

231
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,960
Can't see inside.
Have to go in and check.

232
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,330
Is the key there?

233
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,900
I'll ask the funeral director
to check it out now.

234
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,410
Okay, thank you.

235
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,080
Will you stay and wait?

236
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,350
Not really.

237
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,510
- Let's go then.
- Okay.

238
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,410
Stay there!

239
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,520
Thank you.

240
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,230
Mom, I'll get him out soon.

241
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:33,720
I'm so sorry.

242
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,190
What the hell?

243
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,640
Give me a break!

244
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,340
Please, not yet!

245
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,350
I'm begging you!

246
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,490
Hang up! Please!
I'm so close!

247
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,650
Mom, mom, please,
do something!

248
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,100
Hang up! Hang up!
Please!

249
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,250
It's time, Mr. Ko...

250
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:40,880
Okay.

251
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,890
- Mr. Ko?
- Yes?

252
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:43,740
My Lord is always nearby...

253
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,260
Why is this so heavy?

254
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,260
Careful, go slowly.

255
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,190
Mother...

256
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,270
Mom, I'm sorry!

257
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,470
I'll be back soon.

258
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,740
What a great son.

259
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,790
- Mother!
- Gun-su!

260
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,250
Great son indeed.

261
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,620
Gun-su, we should go now.

262
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:41,530
Hey, hey!

263
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,410
What's this?

264
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,030
It's...

265
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,970
Some bastard stole
her toy soldier!

266
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,540
I'll snap that bastard's neck!

267
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,850
She was wailing so I got it
from the hospital shop,

268
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:54,650
it's not expensive.

269
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:55,820
Hospital shop?

270
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,760
It's pretty fast.

271
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,390
Mina, that's enough,
I'm gonna get mad.

272
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,640
IAD backed off quite easily.

273
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:17,030
They confiscated the money
and called it quits.

274
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,470
We all went to great lengths
to save your ass.

275
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,010
We're the best, aren't we?

276
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,480
Thank you,
I'll see you tomorrow.

277
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,280
Okay, I understand.

278
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,490
Mister, get out.

279
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,460
Are you drunk?

280
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,800
Good afternoon.
Western District Det. Ko.

281
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,440
Why did you park
on a right-turn lane?

282
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:31,540
You know better.

283
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,510
This is a recently confiscated
homemade C4,

284
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,620
the explosive yield is tremendous,

285
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,130
and can be remotely detonated.

286
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:45,600
So desperate to make an impression
on the new commissioner.

287
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,820
Not too many reporters.

288
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:50,370
It detonates 2 minutes after
pushing this button.

289
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,600
We'll start the demonstration.

290
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:55,040
DEMONSTRATION OF I.E.D.

291
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:59,640
We'll also blow 4 societal evils
as part of our campaign

292
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,740
with the bomb.

293
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,140
Armed.

294
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,080
Det. Ko's back.

295
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,350
Afternoon.

296
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,580
Sent her off well?

297
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,860
Yes.

298
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,690
It all worked out in the end.

299
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,120
- An emotional turmoil, eh?
- Thanks to you.

300
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:18,990
Don't be sarcastic,
Choi took care of the mess.

301
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,890
Nice, eh?
You owe me a dinner.

302
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,460
Fine.

303
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,160
How's Ms. Autumn?

304
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,160
Goddammit!

305
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,970
Ask this fucker,
fucking newbie.

306
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,570
Careful, they'll be
on your ass again soon.

307
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,910
Looks like it'll go off now.

308
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,040
Making a fuss
over some fireworks.

309
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,950
Holy fuck!

310
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:45,150
- That was huge!
- Someone's fucked.

311
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:47,720
Holy shit!

312
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,180
Chief, look...

313
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,020
Isn't that your new car?

314
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,520
Your Grandeur!

315
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,430
Goddamn son of a bitch!

316
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,890
They should've been more careful...

317
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,830
Why isn't the key working?

318
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,870
Here.

319
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:03,940
What's this?

320
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,430
Cold cases, and cases nearing
statute of limitations,

321
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,810
we're told to focus on these.

322
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,910
Why?

323
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,680
Probably our punishment.

324
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,880
Fuckers...

325
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,590
Suit up!

326
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,690
- We got a tip.
- What?

327
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,120
Lee Gwang-min.

328
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,850
The very definition of a killer's face.

329
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,500
WANTED FOR MURDER

330
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,040
- What are you doing?
- What?

331
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,510
- Let's go!
- Okay.

332
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,570
This fucker was a front for
bars and brothels,

333
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,900
he's suspected of killing
2 of his competitors.

334
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:10,770
This'll not only get us off the hook
but promotions too.

335
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,040
If we get him, you cuff him,
I'll let you have this.

336
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,870
I'm the best, eh?

337
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,100
Fucking dog...

338
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,970
Chief, maybe it was a prank call.

339
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,730
No, I can feel it.

340
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,970
Sir, I don't think he's here either.

341
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,810
Where is he then?

342
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,280
Who... knows?

343
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:54,850
Get your gun out!

344
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,490
Hey!

345
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:00,820
Police! Freeze!

346
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,330
What the hell?
No one's here.

347
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,200
Dammit!

348
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,100
Chief, take a look!

349
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,070
So he did live here.

350
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,880
Maybe he got tipped off.

351
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,980
Let's look around
for any evidence.

352
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:29,750
Okay.

353
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,760
Where could this fucker be?

354
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,390
What are you doing there?

355
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,240
Central District officer Lee Jin-ho.

356
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,070
What's up?

357
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,840
I was checking up
on a car accident report.

358
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:58,970
This must be it.

359
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,680
Any injuries?

360
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,420
The report says,

361
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,880
hit-and-run victim was
carried off in the trunk.

362
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,320
When? Today?

363
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,930
No, a few days ago.

364
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,760
On the night of 21st?

365
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,170
Who was the tipper?

366
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,830
It was from a pay phone,
hung up before we could get ID.

367
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:28,470
Det. Ko!
Find anything?

368
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,340
- Officer Lee!
- Salute!

369
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,030
Hey man!

370
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,410
Remember Lt. Park
who helped us on the IAD matter?

371
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,180
- He's in Park's unit.
- Yeah?

372
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,040
What are you doing?

373
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:42,980
It's a hit-and-run,
the perp left with the body.

374
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,160
Oh yeah?

375
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,250
Brass balls on that one.

376
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,920
Find anything?

377
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,390
I have to check
the security cam feed.

378
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:57,460
Good, we should take a look too.

379
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,110
Maybe Lee makes a cameo.

380
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,700
Sure.

381
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,200
- Go follow up on it.
- Okay.

382
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,840
Chief, I can do that,
I'll check it out.

383
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,210
- Yeah?
- Sure.

384
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,780
- Nah. Choi, you do it.
- Okay.

385
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,940
No, allow me.

386
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,520
Buy Park a round of
drinks afterwards.

387
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,750
You don't know him anyway.

388
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,760
I've been away too long,
I don't mind.

389
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:19,520
I'll take care of it.

390
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,780
I need to take some photos.

391
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,330
- Yeah? I'll meet you later.
- Okay.

392
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,690
See you soon.

393
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:31,170
Is that so?

394
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,300
A big fat raincheck then.

395
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:34,830
Great.

396
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,430
Today was perfect.

397
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,280
What brings you here?

398
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,150
Evening, sir.

399
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,810
What's got into you?
I love you, man.

400
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,710
Snack time.

401
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,820
- Anything?
- Not a thing.

402
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:58,390
How's the hit-and-run case?

403
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,520
The video quality is bad,

404
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:03,930
and this must be the spot,
but nothing yet.

405
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:07,170
Bad quality, huh?

406
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,240
- Officer Lee.
- Yes, sir?

407
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,140
Let's eat.

408
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,340
Come on, take a break.

409
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,210
Wait, rewind a bit.

410
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,850
Sir?

411
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,350
The video, rewind it.

412
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,050
Play.

413
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:28,920
Right there.

414
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,120
A frame forward.

415
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:36,030
There! That's it!

416
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,200
- Brake lights!
- What about it?

417
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:44,200
Other cars just drove off,
but why'd this car brake here?

418
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,210
Because something popped up,
so he braked!

419
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,240
What happened next?

420
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:49,950
Bang!

421
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,280
Where's the accident point?

422
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,450
- About here.
- See?

423
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,080
Made impact here,

424
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,630
and he fell on this spot.

425
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,250
Look, that bitch.

426
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:03,880
The mutt's watching something.

427
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,620
Which means,
something happened here.

428
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,930
This is the night of 21st.
The car type is...

429
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,000
It's Lotze, definitely.

430
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:14,770
A black one.

431
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:15,800
Wait!

432
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,210
- You got a Lotze, right?
- What?

433
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,240
Is this a Lotze?

434
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,140
Yeah...

435
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:22,140
The plate is...

436
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,210
That's an 8, first one.

437
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,150
Gun-su, looks like an 8, right?

438
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,120
8

439
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,390
- More like 3.
- It is indeed 8!

440
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:38,090
Left side is kinda visible too.

441
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,930
It's 8!

442
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,730
Next one is...

443
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:56,050
I can't tell.

444
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:57,670
Can't see shit.

445
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,620
Are we still going away
for the weekend?

446
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,020
For Mina's birthday.

447
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,560
We are,
I told you already.

448
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,660
Gun-su.

449
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:17,100
I wanna talk about something,
don't be mad, okay?

450
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,400
Can't we kick out our shop tenant
and open a toast shop there?

451
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:26,940
I'm told snack shops
do well there!

452
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:28,700
I'll pay the full rent!

453
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,050
We can't kick them out
before lease's up.

454
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,180
But you're a cop.

455
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:33,650
Cops aren't gangsters!

456
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,590
Come on, let me.
Please?

457
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,420
We can't live off you forever.

458
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:42,220
Ow! Hot!

459
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,190
Again?

460
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:45,990
You okay?

461
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,260
Yeah.

462
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:50,960
I gotta do something about
that shower head.

463
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,970
It's a great idea,
don't you think?

464
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,240
Let's talk later, okay?

465
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,140
- By the way.
- What now!

466
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:06,010
Did mom have a man?

467
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,210
What are you saying?

468
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,620
I went to a fortuneteller yesterday,

469
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:13,690
and he said mom had a man.

470
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,490
By her side, even now.

471
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,460
What?

472
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:21,630
It's weird,
he got everything else right.

473
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,240
About his failed flower shop,
even your divorce.

474
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:31,000
Maybe mom did have a lover.

475
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,470
What? She did?

476
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:36,570
Yeah, I guess.

477
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,650
Wow, that's awesome!

478
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,050
Isn't it?

479
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:46,280
NATIONAL LISTING OF
BLACK LOTZE OWNERS

480
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,720
KO GUN-SU

481
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,790
Western District homicide.

482
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:03,140
Good afternoon,
I'd like to report a wanted man.

483
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:04,280
One moment please.

484
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,340
Go ahead.

485
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:09,580
I saw Lee Gwang-min.

486
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,750
What? Who?

487
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,210
I saw Lee Gwang-min.

488
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,090
Listen, mister.

489
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,690
Don't make prank calls, okay?

490
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,570
Western District homicide.

491
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:38,110
I think it's the same dude.

492
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,040
What is it?

493
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,610
He's asking for you.

494
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:47,280
What is it?
I said don't prank call!

495
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:49,850
I wanted to make a report,
why is that a prank?

496
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:54,350
Fine, let's hear it.

497
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,100
Like I said,
I saw Lee Gwang-min.

498
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,460
Where is he now then?

499
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:02,860
That's what I wanted to ask you.

500
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:05,370
Are you jerking me off?
What a guy.

501
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:08,340
No, I mean, where did you
take him, Det. Ko?

502
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,370
Say what?

503
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,570
Did he fly into the sunset
or dug himself into the earth?

504
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,300
Black Lotze's Ko Gun-su.

Yes.

508
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:42,670
Det. Ko.

509
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:43,910
Yeah?

510
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:45,210
He wants you to
answer your phone.

511
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:47,950
What?

512
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:49,140
Your cell phone.

515
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:06,290
The one who knows
you killed Lee.

516
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,540
Sleeping fine after killing a man?

517
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,450
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

518
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,040
Who are you?

519
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,880
Det. Ko, you're beginning to
look pathetic.

520
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:33,850
I think you're gravely
mistaken about something.

521
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,320
Wow, nice job fixing your car.

522
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:38,460
You've been busy.

523
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,490
Oh that...

524
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,640
I had a minor collision
that my insurance took care of.

525
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,400
You got it all wrong, right?

526
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,910
- Already got an alibi?
- I'm hanging up now.

527
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,810
Should I report that Lee was
spotted at Mt. Yangja?

528
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:01,980
I hope you buried him well.

529
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:05,250
That never happened,
so stop calling, motherfucker!

530
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:08,330
I'll report when you hang up.

531
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:12,960
See? You killed him.

532
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,390
Son of a bitch!

533
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:17,800
Tell me,
who are you?

534
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,430
I've had it!

535
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:22,840
Swear at me once more,
I'll report.

536
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:24,040
Got your attention?

537
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,940
- Salute!
- Salute!

538
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:30,410
You're not in the right
mindset to listen.

539
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:34,550
I'll let you sweat a bit
and tell you my demands.

540
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:40,280
And don't bother looking for me,
I'll report if you annoy me.

541
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:43,490
You look better than I expected.

542
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,590
Must not feel guilt.

543
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:47,430
Great attitude.

544
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:32,570
What the hell!

545
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:48,880
The light's green,
why aren't you going?!

546
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,990
Shall we... go?

547
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:54,620
Mister.

548
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:58,990
I said $10 per second.

549
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:02,630
You already made...

550
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:06,400
$150, $160,
wow, $200.

00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:23,650
Get ready.

- What's wrong?
- Huh?

557
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:31,740
Had a nightmare?

558
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,110
Were you napping?

559
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:35,950
We've been hiking all day.

560
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:37,980
Where were you?

561
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:39,050
Mt. Yangja.

562
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,920
Isn't your mother buried there?

563
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:43,660
Yeah.

564
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,130
Wait.

565
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:48,660
Why there?

566
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:51,760
Lee's cell phone's last
known location was there,

567
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:55,130
but due to network overlap,
we didn't get a pinpoint location.

568
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:57,670
The car looks new,
did you replace the bumper?

569
00:52:58,780 --> 00:52:59,240
Had an accident?

570
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,210
Yeah, I told you about that.

571
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:04,020
Right.

572
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:05,180
Replaced the whole front?

573
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:06,820
Good thing you weren't hurt.

574
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,110

00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:40,350
Did you give it a thought?
Can we talk now?

578
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:43,280
- I have a question.
- Okay.

579
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,080
How did you see me...

580
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:52,390
burying Lee?
It was pitch dark.

581
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,370
Dark? Doesn't mean I can't.

582
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:57,290
Let's not get sidetracked.

583
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,370
You didn't see it yourself.

584
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:01,000
You don't know where Lee is.

585
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:06,930
Then...

586
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:12,950
whether you report,
or start digging,

587
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,110
go right ahead.

588
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:18,320
But you'll never find him.

589
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:20,220
Why?

590
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,190
There's no proof that
he was buried, asshole!

591
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:26,020
There's no proof,
you fucking asshole!

592
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,190
I'm done, fucker!

593
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:33,660

00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:38,840
Be cool.

596
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,690
Answer the damn phone.

597
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,990
- Dinner anyone?
- Western District...

598
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,030
- Sure, I'm friggin' starving.
- One moment...

599
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:04,300
He wants to report a car accident.

600
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,730
- Then transfer to traffic.
- Hey, hey, hey!

601
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:12,300
- It's a prank call.
- Yeah?

602
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:24,320
What is it?

603
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,920
We've been getting
prank calls all afternoon.

604
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:32,850
Prank calling should be fined,
that'll teach them.

605
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,000
Go eat, go on.

606
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,060
Sure.

607
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:41,130
They'll bitch at us
for not answering later.

608
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:43,070
What a headache.

609
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,770
Hey, hey!

610
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,870
Stop it!
What's wrong?!

611
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:23,180
What's going on?!

612
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,980
How dare you ignore my calls!
Shall I expose you?!

613
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:27,910
What's wrong?!

614
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:31,990
What's with you?

615
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,320
Shit, it's not him?

616
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:37,960
No, no, no.

617
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,450
What, wrong man?

618
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,500
He's our colleague.

619
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:45,060
- A cop?
- Yeah, a cop.

620
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:48,830
Fuck, I've gone mental.

621
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,810
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

622
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:52,570
You looked like
the man who conned me.

623
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,810
I'm sorry, truly.

624
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:59,350
Chief, this is Lt. Park,
who helped us on the IAD matter.

625
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:04,390
Lieutenant, so good to meet you,
we owe you.

626
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,520
This is our savior!

627
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:09,530
Gun-su, you got a beat
from our savior.

628
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:12,930
- Det. Ko Gun-su?
- Yeah.

629
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:13,960
Seriously?

630
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:15,160
I don't believe this.

631
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:18,200
I hope you're not bleeding.

632
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:21,970
I'm sorry again,
let me formally introduce myself.

633
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:23,930
I'm Park Chang-min.

634
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,270
Something about you two.

635
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,410
Saved you last time,
almost killed you today.

636
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:33,480
You got a great face.

637
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,150
Hold on,
let's see here...

638
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:41,490
I'm sorry.

639
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:42,920
Gonna visit the toilet.

640
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:51,870
Almost had a heart attack.

641
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,400
That's Lt. Park?

642
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:56,310
Yeah.

643
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:18,450
You startled me.

644
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:27,440
There are 2 types of humans.

645
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:31,370
One who lowers his tail
before the alpha.

646
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:36,640
And the one who tries hard
after a beat.

647
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,510
Which one are you?

648
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:47,990
You're a cop?

649
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,220
Didn't I give you a jolt?
That sinking feeling.

650
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:54,690
What do you want?

651
00:58:56,270 --> 00:59:01,470
That was the most important
and smart thing you've ever said.

652
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:05,270
What I want?
It's simple.

653
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,410
Bring Lee.
No questions.

654
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:11,700
Why?

655
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:16,550
Curiosity killed the cat.

656
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:22,120
Let's not mince words,
just get him.

657
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:26,330
That's too bad though.

658
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:31,730
I really don't know where he is.

659
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:42,200
Not good.

660
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,030
Motherfucker!

661
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,730
Wait, wait, wait.

662
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,130
You pack a punch.

663
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:14,340
A cop shouldn't hit another cop.

664
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:16,580
You got a mean hook.

665
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,180
If your hook hurts this much,

666
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:24,310
imagine Lee's pain
when you ran him over.

667
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:26,120
Dammit!

668
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:30,690
Come out!

669
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:35,590
Come out, asshole!

670
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,400
Connecting a few jabs
got your ego through the roof?

671
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,090
You okay?
Still breathing.

672
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:06,360
This is too gay for my taste.

673
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,330
Hold still.

674
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:18,110
Take it easy,
drink up.

675
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,200
I'll get him!

676
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:27,080
I'll get him!
I will!

677
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:34,150
Now we're seeing eye to eye.

678
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:39,350
Dang it.

679
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:52,740
Get Lee ready by tonight.

680
01:01:58,850 --> 01:01:59,610
I'll call.

681
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:49,060
Fuck...

682
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,260
There has to be a reason.

683
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:56,470
Why is he looking for a dead man?

684
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,180
Give me a break!

685
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:12,180
What's this?

686
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:25,230
Bullet holes...

687
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:29,940
He was already dead?

688
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:15,480
Who's there?

689
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:41,340
That bitch...

690
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:58,790
PRIVATE PIGGY BANK

691
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:11,670
Yo, Gwang-min!
Why's it so hard to reach you?!

692
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:14,600
I thought Lt. Park
got to you already.

693
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:16,500
Where are you?

694
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:17,610
Why aren't you answ...

695
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,740
You're not him...
Who are you?

696
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:31,890
38-years old,
Jo Neung-hyun.

697
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:35,100
3 prior convictions,

698
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:38,900
from the same town as Lee,
probably worked together.

699
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:41,030
Triangulate him
at 1-minute interval,

700
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:46,840
and send his mugshot
and current location to my phone!

701
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,440
Sir, that's illegal.

702
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:51,570
I need to get a warrant and...

703
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:54,120
Warrant my ass!
Time's ticking!

704
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:55,810
Just send it,
I'll take the heat!

705
01:05:57,690 --> 01:05:58,950
- Det. Ko?
- Yes, sir.

706
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:00,050
Where is he?

707
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:02,380
I'm not sure.

708
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:05,690
Where is that son of a bitch
roaming around?

709
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:07,560
What's this?

710
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:10,530
Those are our unit's traffic tickets.

711
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:12,730
I wanted to take care of it
before we're fined.

712
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:14,800
- Mine?
- No...

713
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:15,870
Gun-su's, eh?

714
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:19,030
$120.

715
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,010
Like a bat out of hell.

716
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:37,460
JO NEUNG-HYUN

717
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:10,290
Motherfucker!

718
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:16,230
Stop!

719
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,510
Asshole, I'm not here for you!

720
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,880
Let's just chat!

721
01:07:31,550 --> 01:07:32,520
Stop right there!

722
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:39,450
Hey!

723
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:41,790
Buddy, you okay?!

724
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:45,860
Watch out for the cars!

725
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:47,560
Is he nuts?!

726
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,260
Stop!

727
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:53,170
Fucking...

728
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:58,230
What a fucking moron...

729
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,230
I just want to talk...

730
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:04,940
I really don't know!

731
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:06,680
All I want to know is...

732
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:11,050
the reason why
Park's looking for Lee.

733
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:13,060
I don't know, I swear!

734
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:15,990
Please let me go, okay?

735
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:19,760
You really don't?

736
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:21,230
I don't! Fuck you!

737
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:27,570
Fine, just go.

738
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:28,730
Thank you.

739
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:31,010
Go.

740
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:32,870
Step forward.

741
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:35,740
- Go on.
- Wait!

742
01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:37,570
- Keep going.
- I can't!

743
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:38,870
To your next life.

744
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:40,980
Forward.

745
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:43,290
- Go ahead.
- Don't untie it!

746
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:45,150
Don't untie, you assho...
Please!

747
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:46,880
Step forward,
I'm letting you go!

748
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:47,980
I'll talk! I'll tell you!

749
01:08:48,730 --> 01:08:49,890
I'll fucking talk!

750
01:08:50,190 --> 01:08:53,220
Don't swear motherfucker!
Don't fucking swear!

751
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:54,560
I'll tell you.

752
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:02,860
Lee stole Park's key.

753
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:05,670
Key?

754
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:07,940
To a private safe.
Park's key.

755
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:09,700
What's inside?

756
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:12,780
Talk, asshole!

757
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:16,080
Fuck! I'm so fucking scared!
Son of a bitch!

758
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:20,150
From the beginning,
speak concisely!

759
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:21,090
I'll talk.

760
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:23,920
- Don't make me ask you again.
- Okay, I'll talk.

761
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:27,960
The drugs that Park brought in...

762
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:31,200
- Drugs?
- Yes.

763
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:37,040
When Park was in vice squad,

764
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:41,270
he snatched the confiscated drugs.

765
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:18,180
I hear tons of drugs get
confiscated by the customs,

766
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:23,150
he sold some off,
and ran bars and clubs with it.

767
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:25,780
It was a mega hit.

768
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,250
Once you taste it,
you can never go back.

769
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,990
You'll become
a permanent regular.

770
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,090
Even the Yakuza wanted
a piece of it.

771
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:39,730
Park was a major player
in this scene.

772
01:10:59,890 --> 01:11:03,950
When Park went to sign a deal
with Yakuza, Lee took off.

773
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:06,290
With the money and drugs.

774
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,730
So where's the key now?

775
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:14,130
Lee keeps anything important
on his body.

776
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:16,070
Inside.

777
01:11:31,290 --> 01:11:32,950
What the hell am I doing?

778
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:36,450
So nasty!

779
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,050
Fuck!

780
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:02,280
Ko Gun-su!
Stay there!

781
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:04,320
Don't move.

782
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:07,920
What the fuck man?!

783
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:09,790
Drop the knife!

784
01:12:10,990 --> 01:12:11,760
- Listen...
- Drop the knife!

785
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:12,830
Come on, man.

786
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:13,820
Drop the fucking knife!

787
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:15,920
Just relax.

788
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:21,170
Back off.

789
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,840
Hey, hey!

790
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:23,400
I... I didn't do this.

791
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,040
Then why are you here!

792
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:26,400
I didn't! I didn't kill him!

793
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:27,500
What happened is...

794
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:30,110
You have to believe me!

795
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:32,040
Here, take a look.

796
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,940
You had the accident on 23rd.

797
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:36,840
This is from 2 days earlier.

798
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:40,480
Your car was already wrecked
before the accident.

799
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,920
Am I still wrong?
Am I?!

800
01:12:43,890 --> 01:12:45,450
Alright, just lower your gun.

801
01:12:46,330 --> 01:12:49,770
Hey! What are you doing?!

802
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:53,460
We're no model cops,
but you've gone too far!

803
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:56,430
Come on!
You got it all wrong!

804
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,460
Goddammit!

805
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:17,050
How did you end up like this?

806
01:13:17,330 --> 01:13:18,450
Forget it,
just drop it.

807
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:24,230
I'll confess back at the station,
so let's go.

808
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:28,960
I'm really tired today.

809
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:34,270
Whatever happens,
I just wanna rest.

810
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:36,200
Rest?

811
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:38,940
You wanna rest?

812
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,220
Always so nonchalant.

813
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:49,130
Manslaughter and disposal of body
will get you near life.

814
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:51,420
Who cares about you,
but your kid?

815
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:54,490
You drive me insane.

816
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:57,160
Absolutely insane.

817
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:06,870
Fuck it, I don't care.

818
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:09,610
Do whatever, it's up to you.

819
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:14,610
Take it.

820
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:16,950
Fuck it all.

821
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:23,560
Would I live comfortably
with you locked up?

822
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:26,990
You got an interesting fate.

823
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:30,460
Your mother's funeral is barely over,
and now this?

824
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,000
Sang-ho.

825
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:33,890
Don't thank me,
I don't wanna hear it.

826
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:35,600
- Help me.
- What now?!

827
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:39,940
I'm being blackmailed by a cop.

828
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:43,040
What's this nonsense?

829
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:44,380
You know him.

830
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:46,510
Park Chang-min.

831
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:50,880
I think he killed Lee too.

832
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:56,920
That corpse up there,
that's Lee.

833
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:04,630
You have to believe
everything I tell you, okay?

834
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:08,230
That night...

835
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:12,440
I did hit someone.

836
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:15,210
Hold on.

837
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:17,910
UNKNOWN CALLER ID

838
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,190
Hello?

839
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:28,560
It's me,
is Det. Choi with you?

840
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:30,750
What?

841
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:32,990
Get out,
this is important.

842
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,530
Are you watching us now?

843
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:41,090
If you don't want to be
a burden on him, get out.

844
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:47,270
What is it?!

845
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:51,010
You like being a peeping tom?

846
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:57,320
Shut up and come to the street
in front of you.

847
01:15:58,290 --> 01:15:59,310
5 more steps forward.

848
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:04,660
- There?
- Yes, where are you?

849
01:16:05,490 --> 01:16:06,430
Okay.

850
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,230
Hello? Hello!

851
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:10,860
Hey!

852
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:14,370
Son of a bitch...

853
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,770
UNKNOWN CALLER ID

854
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,380
How was the aim?
The driver's good eh?

855
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,620
Chatting up is all but over.

856
01:17:05,190 --> 01:17:07,090
Dig up Lee by 6 a.m.

857
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:10,620
What have you done?

858
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:16,260
I told you I'd bring him, fucker!

859
01:17:17,070 --> 01:17:17,690
Are you crying?

860
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:22,610
Didn't know you were emotional,
focus on the work.

861
01:17:23,070 --> 01:17:23,800
Buddy.

862
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:28,710
It's off.

863
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:32,480
I'm turning myself in.
You're finished too, motherfucker!

864
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,490
You're finished!

865
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,210
Yeah?
Hold on a minute.

866
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:41,690
Who is it?

867
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:44,180
It's Lt. Park,
I called earlier.

868
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:45,850
Oh, hello.

869
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:47,330
Good to see you.

870
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,630
- Gun-su's not here yet.
- It's him on the phone.

871
01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:53,230
- I'm at your house now.
- Don't you dare!

872
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:55,400
Wait inside?

873
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:58,270
I see, hurry now.

874
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:01,200
Hi, you must be Mina!

875
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:03,670
Don't! Please don't!

876
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:23,260
Welcome home.

877
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:24,390
Hey.

878
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,300
Mina's sleeping.

879
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:37,240
Hey!

880
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:41,470
What's wrong with you?

881
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:43,080
Wasn't...

882
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,850
Wasn't someone here?

883
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:49,290
Your friend...

884
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:52,460
He dropped off a toy,
he said he'd be back.

885
01:18:52,930 --> 01:18:53,760
What?

886
01:19:20,190 --> 01:19:24,590
TURNING YOURSELF IN WON'T
END YOUR PROBLEM.

887
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,820
BRING LEE BY 6.

888
01:19:38,570 --> 01:19:39,540
Fucking hell...

889
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:57,790
I made hotel reservations,

890
01:19:58,530 --> 01:20:01,590
so when Mina wakes up,
you guys go on ahead.

891
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:02,920
Got it?

892
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:04,330
You're not coming with?

893
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,360
I'll come as soon as
I finish work.

894
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:08,440
When will that be?

895
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:10,710
I'll be there ASAP,
so get there first!

896
01:20:12,710 --> 01:20:14,510
- Are you in trouble?
- Of course not.

897
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,940
Here, this is the reservation slip.

898
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:19,810
Okay? I gotta go.

899
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:23,710
5 blanks returned,
and here's 5 live rounds.

900
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:24,510
Okay.

901
01:20:24,790 --> 01:20:28,850
Detective, could you
sign the release form?

902
01:20:30,690 --> 01:20:31,320
It's not here...

903
01:20:31,990 --> 01:20:32,790
One moment.

904
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:36,860
Detective, we ordered some food,

905
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:39,230
would you like to join us?

906
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:42,900
Their sauce's a little different.

907
01:20:43,370 --> 01:20:44,400
It's so good.

908
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:05,520
I'll give him back alright!

909
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:38,750
Slow down now.

910
01:21:40,930 --> 01:21:42,660
That's far enough.

911
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:46,430
Bring the body over.

912
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,030
Load him.

913
01:22:26,710 --> 01:22:28,040
Hold it, stay put.

914
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:29,840
Look what we got here?

915
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:34,880
Hold still asshole!
Car key...

916
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:37,540
Got anything else?

917
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:43,060
Well, look at this.

918
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:52,570
Move aside.

919
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:18,690
Still inside.

920
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:24,930
Those bullet holes,
did you shoot him?

921
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:28,500
Yeah, about that.

922
01:23:29,510 --> 01:23:30,400
Okay, I shot him,

923
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:33,440
then bam!
You ran him over.

924
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:35,840
So who killed him?

925
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:38,710
You? Or me?

926
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:41,540
Okay, well...

927
01:23:41,820 --> 01:23:42,750
That's not very important.

928
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:45,980
Are we done here?

929
01:23:46,990 --> 01:23:47,820
Need a receipt or something?

930
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:49,920
I'm going.

931
01:23:54,830 --> 01:23:57,100
Wait, one last thing.

932
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:02,640
It's a blank.

933
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:05,500
Hey, hey! Wait!

934
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:08,810
Look!

935
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:12,880
I've been a fucking cop
for a decade!

936
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:15,740
Would I come here
without an insurance?!

937
01:24:16,650 --> 01:24:18,550
If you fucking kill me,

938
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:26,580
then a timed e-mail will be sent
to the station in the morning.

939
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:32,100
It contains details
of your drug dealings,

940
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,830
illegal brothel operation!

941
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:38,840
As well as the murders of
Lee and Det. Choi!

942
01:24:39,270 --> 01:24:41,240
I'm sure those are
just a few of your crimes,

943
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:45,770
but I bet $180 that you'll
at least get a life sentence!

944
01:24:46,010 --> 01:24:47,570
I think you missed a few others.

945
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:50,110
Go ahead, shoot me!

946
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:55,890
Are you gonna shoot?
Get it over with.

947
01:24:56,690 --> 01:24:58,560
If you won't,
then holster it, fucker!

948
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:00,590
Time's ticking.

949
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:07,740
Okay.

950
01:25:10,070 --> 01:25:12,540
Why would I kill you?

951
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:15,240
You're a useful guy,
why'd I do that?

952
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:18,610
We're on the same boat, right?

953
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:20,610
Let's work together.

954
01:25:22,580 --> 01:25:26,720
It's about time
you play with the big boys.

955
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,260
You gotta live hard.
And raise Mina properly.

956
01:25:30,930 --> 01:25:33,690
Damn, that was awesome.

957
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:36,860
Take care, man.

958
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:56,010
Why is that fucker
coming this way?!

959
01:26:08,130 --> 01:26:09,790
No, no, no!

960
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:13,630
Just keep going!

961
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:22,800
Det. Ko.

962
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:29,080
There's an amazing diner
no one knows near here.

963
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:31,780
I'll let you in on the secret.

964
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:33,920
- The soup there...
- I don't want it!

965
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,020
Your loss.

966
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:05,490
Yeah, I'm on my way.
What's Mina doing?

967
01:30:06,170 --> 01:30:06,790
Hold on.

968
01:30:07,170 --> 01:30:09,300
Mina, it's daddy.

969
01:30:11,570 --> 01:30:14,170
Sweetie, it's dad.

970
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:16,340
Did you eat
your birthday breakfast?

971
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,070
Yes, I ate so much.

972
01:30:19,010 --> 01:30:23,510
While I'm not there,
be good to aunt and uncle.

973
01:30:23,620 --> 01:30:25,990
Have all your meals, okay?

974
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:28,510
Okay. Get here fast, daddy.

975
01:30:29,490 --> 01:30:30,320
Sure, sweetie.

976
01:30:31,990 --> 01:30:33,090
Wait a little longer.

977
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,860
Daddy, bye!

978
01:30:36,930 --> 01:30:37,800
Yeah, bye bye.

979
01:30:38,270 --> 01:30:39,560
I love you, daddy!

980
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:43,540
- When's dad coming?
- Very soon.

981
01:30:43,710 --> 01:30:45,900
- Oh yeah?
- Hey Mina...

982
01:30:57,990 --> 01:30:59,510
CHIEF

983
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:17,430
Good, you were home.

984
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:21,100
Thank you.

985
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:54,000
Surprised?

986
01:31:58,650 --> 01:31:59,580
I was too.

987
01:32:05,150 --> 01:32:05,980
Come in.

988
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:09,850
Come in.

989
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:39,250
CHIEF

990
01:32:44,590 --> 01:32:46,030
MISSED CALL: CHIEF

991
01:32:51,270 --> 01:32:52,290
Son of a bitch!

992
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:14,220
Dead?

993
01:33:21,230 --> 01:33:23,200
Holy shit...

994
01:33:51,660 --> 01:33:53,290
Thanks to you asshole,

995
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:56,650
I broke the diving record.

996
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:35,730
What are you doing?

997
01:34:36,710 --> 01:34:37,700
Come on out!

998
01:34:41,410 --> 01:34:43,610
Wanna go again?!

999
01:34:46,950 --> 01:34:49,380
Open this door, shithead!

1000
01:34:51,150 --> 01:34:52,020
Let's see...

1001
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:14,600
Goddammit!

1002
01:35:37,870 --> 01:35:39,460
What the fuck are you doing?!

1003
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:50,610
You're fucking dead!

1004
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:04,350
Dammit!

1005
01:36:42,660 --> 01:36:44,720
Did you fly?

1006
01:37:06,690 --> 01:37:07,490
Come here, you fuck!

1007
01:37:11,890 --> 01:37:12,660
You're fucking dead!

1008
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:28,000
You fuck!

1009
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:48,260
You fuck!

1010
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:54,560
Fuck off!

1011
01:40:28,660 --> 01:40:35,690
Theft and distribution of narcotics,
operating a brothel,

1012
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:40,800
homicide of an officer,
hit-and-run, theft of evidence...

1013
01:40:42,170 --> 01:40:43,970
This will bury us all.

1014
01:40:45,710 --> 01:40:47,440
Let's cover it up.

1015
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:48,540
Sir?

1016
01:40:49,180 --> 01:40:50,910
What should we do with him?

1017
01:40:55,580 --> 01:40:59,880
Why so soon after
a new commissioner took office?

1018
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:02,490
Chief Jang, right?

1019
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:04,150
Yes, sir.

1020
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:07,460
Can you take this to your grave?

1021
01:41:08,530 --> 01:41:09,090
For his sake.

1022
01:41:12,830 --> 01:41:14,670
Yes, I'll take it to my grave.

1023
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:17,700
Good.

1024
01:41:28,580 --> 01:41:31,250
I understand how you feel,
but life isn't all about that.

1025
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:36,780
A year flies by when you're
relaxing in the country.

1026
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:41,860
Giving your severance to
Choi's mother is fine.

1027
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:46,260
But what can you do
besides being a cop?

1028
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:50,200
There're over 12,000 jobs
in this country.

1029
01:41:51,770 --> 01:41:52,740
I'll find something.

1030
01:41:55,640 --> 01:41:58,040
With you gone,
I got nobody!

1031
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:01,340
Gun-su...

1032
01:42:01,650 --> 01:42:03,620
Remember when you became a cop?

1033
01:42:04,150 --> 01:42:05,750
You had 1 adamant goal.

1034
01:42:08,290 --> 01:42:08,980
Retirement with full benefits.

1035
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:12,890
Yeah, the ultimate goal
of all civil servants.

1036
01:42:13,930 --> 01:42:14,920
Let's not lose focus.

1037
01:42:15,260 --> 01:42:17,860
I'll delay your resignation,
so come back soon.

1038
01:42:29,010 --> 01:42:29,600
I'm off.

1039
01:42:37,790 --> 01:42:42,050
Sir, make a border of the mound,
make it strong.

1040
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:43,150
So it can't be dug up.

1041
01:42:44,690 --> 01:42:47,360
It's not a king's tomb,
no one will dig it up.

1042
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,730
Just make sure
it's strong and firm.

1043
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,160
Your mother raised
her children well.

1044
01:42:52,870 --> 01:42:56,000
No one tends their parents'
graves this well nowadays.

1045
01:42:57,670 --> 01:42:58,770
I've noticed you before.

1046
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:03,280
You're a good son,
a very good son.

1047
01:43:06,810 --> 01:43:07,750
Feels nice? "Good son."

1048
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:13,010
With you out of work,
how will we live now?

1049
01:43:13,890 --> 01:43:14,690
What a life...

1050
01:43:17,690 --> 01:43:18,660
- Young-chul.
- Yes?

1051
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:20,230
- Young-chul.
- Yes?

1052
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:22,230
Used truck? Why?

1053
01:43:25,070 --> 01:43:26,690
Toast shop you mentioned.

1054
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:29,270
We should start with a snack car.

1055
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:31,970
I'll talk to the chief about it,

1056
01:43:33,310 --> 01:43:36,640
we can park in front of
the station and feed the unis.

1057
01:43:37,140 --> 01:43:40,110
- Bro...
- Sir.

1058
01:43:40,750 --> 01:43:42,270
How many dicks work at the station?

1059
01:43:43,150 --> 01:43:44,780
- What?
- Officers, I mean.

1060
01:43:47,190 --> 01:43:50,090
Probably around 370-380 in total?

1061
01:43:51,790 --> 01:43:52,780
Let's see then.

1062
01:43:53,130 --> 01:43:59,030
$1.50 per toast,
low estimate of 250,

1063
01:43:59,030 --> 01:43:59,730
so in a day...

1064
01:44:03,170 --> 01:44:04,070
How much?

1065
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:05,800
Dunno, I wasn't a math major.

1066
01:44:05,910 --> 01:44:07,640
Come on!

1067
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:10,010
Let's pack up and go.

1068
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:11,210
Mina!

1069
01:44:12,010 --> 01:44:14,110
Come up, say good bye
to grandma!

1070
01:44:15,950 --> 01:44:17,710
- Come up!
- Okay!

1071
01:44:22,060 --> 01:44:23,820
Say good bye to her.

1072
01:44:24,330 --> 01:44:25,990
Good bye, grandma!

1073
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:27,020
I'll come again.

1074
01:44:27,130 --> 01:44:28,790
Wipe your hands.
Toss that.

1075
01:44:29,030 --> 01:44:30,260
Very good.

1076
01:44:30,930 --> 01:44:32,420
Clean hands!

1077
01:44:55,390 --> 01:44:59,290
PRIVATE PIGGY BANK

1078
01:45:06,470 --> 01:45:07,800
Boss, we got a client.

1079
01:45:15,210 --> 01:45:17,080
Check him.

1080
01:45:18,410 --> 01:45:19,470
Okay.

1081
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:28,650
Key!

1082
01:45:35,830 --> 01:45:36,760
It's ours.

1083
01:45:37,130 --> 01:45:37,960
Then show him in.

1084
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:41,430
Shouldn't we check his ID?

1085
01:45:41,770 --> 01:45:44,330
Boy, if we did,
we'd be out of business.

1086
01:45:45,540 --> 01:45:47,740
- Withdrawing?
- Yes.

1087
01:45:48,340 --> 01:45:49,810
- How much of it?
- Everything.

1088
01:45:55,450 --> 01:45:58,080
I think the safe owner
gave you bad info.

1089
01:45:58,450 --> 01:45:59,420
What?

1090
01:46:04,130 --> 01:46:06,320
Enter the passcode inside.

1091
01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:03,980
A HARD DAY

1092
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:09,010
LEE Sun-kyun

1093
01:47:09,090 --> 01:47:13,990
