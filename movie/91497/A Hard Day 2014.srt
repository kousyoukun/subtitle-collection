I'm on my way asswipe!

00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:42,863
How did you get out of there?

5
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,234
Where are you?
- Forget it.

6
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:49,271
If you tell me where the key is
I can just hide it for you.

7
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:53,914
I have the key,
how many times must I tell you?!

8
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,213
When are they arriving?

9
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,217
The rat squad'll be here
within the hour.

10
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,253
Fine, get off my ass.

I'll be there soon,
don't touch my stuff.

So get here ASAP.

Got another call.

14
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,616
When will you be back?

15
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:11,495
The elders are upset that
head of the family is gone.

16
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,296
I wouldn't have left the funeral
if it wasn't serious.

17
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,230
What's going on?

18
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:20,065
I'll be there soon,
so sit tight with your hubby.

19
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,633
So much for passing off
as a good son.

20
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,008
Just get here quick!

21
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,276
How's Mina?
What's she doing?

22
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,206
Your kid's fine!

23
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,916
Hey... sis...

24
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,219

00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,492

Daddy! Whatcha doing?

34
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:31,732
Hey Mina... Sweetie...

35
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,705
- Did you buy the cake?
- What?

36
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:35,472
Huh? What?
Yeah, that...

37
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,635
You promised,
a chocolate cake!

38
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:41,542
Right, a chocolate cake.

39
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,148
Did buy it yet?

40
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,011
- Daddy?
- Sweetie...

41
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,679
I'll call you back!

42
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,453
Dammit...

43
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,474
Jesus Christ...

44
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,625
Evening.
DUI checkpoint, sir.

45
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,561
- DUI check.
- Evening, officer.

46
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:18,499
I...

47
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:24,843
I'm Western District Homicide
Det. Ko Gun-su...

48
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,241
Northern District
officer Lee Dong-yun.

49
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,473
I see, thanks for your work.

50
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,774
Keep at it, thanks bud.

51
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,519
Could you blow into this?

52
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,081
What?

53
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:37,751
You drank? Didn't you?

54
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,695
You did.

55
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:45,631
It's my mother's funeral,
so I had a drink.

56
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,663
Can't you let me off the hook?

57
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,328
Give it a blow please.

58
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,372
My mother passed away.

59
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,241
I see,
one moment please.

60
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,547
- Officer Lee!
- Yeah, one sec.

61
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,130
Get out of the car!

62
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,335
Get out of the car now!

63
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,403
What is it?

64
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,568
He attempted to flee the scene.

65
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,307
Are you deaf?

66
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:36,709
Evening, officer!

67
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,481
I'm Western District Homicide
Det. Ko.

68
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:44,417
I had a sip
at my mother's funeral...

69
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:45,616
Couldn't I get a pass?

70
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,985
No ID, and he was acting suspicious.

71
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:49,827
Officer Lee, come on, man.

72
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:50,988
What's your ID number?

73
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,633
Come on, we're all cops here.

74
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,028
So what's your ID number?

75
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,806
760625-12653172

76
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,351
There's an extra number.

77
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:13,779
What?

78
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,913
There are 14 numbers,
ID consists of 13.

79
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,290
- Write it down properly.
- I am sir.

80
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,688
It's... 760625-1265...

81
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,596
Let's check with the database
in my car.

82
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,568
What for?
We're doing that right now.

83
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,968
Call my district and verify!

84
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,664
It'll be simpler that way.

85
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,901
Let's get it over with...
Hey, hey!

86
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,739
- Don't touch my car!
- You had an accident.

87
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,437
- Call and verify!
- Back off, sir.

88
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,640
Officer Choi, pop the trunk.

89
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,006
Yes, sir.

90
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:45,708
Hey! Stop it!

91
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:50,012
Don't you dare!

92
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,124
Let's just check the database...

93
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,717
What do you think you're doing?!

94
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:54,623
Grab him, grab him!

95
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,491
Let go, you son of a bitch!

96
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,428
Let go!

97
00:09:58,931 --> 00:09:59,830
Fucking bitches!

98
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,727
Grab him, now!

99
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,641
Incoming radio from HQ.

100
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:17,414
Go ahead.

101
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,878
The ID is verified,
he's a Western Det. Ko.

102
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:35,698
How can you do this
to fellow cops, goddammit!

103
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,366
Open this drawer.

104
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,736
Why so many locks on this?

105
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:43,974
Is Det. Ko here?

106
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,503
He's mourning at the moment.

107
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,082
Hammer.

108
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,543
What's inside?

109
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,385
He said to leave it.

110
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:56,547
What?

111
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,549
You know his temper.

112
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,091
God-fucking-damn...

113
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,164
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all, sir.

114
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:11,727
You, come here.

115
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,562
Mr. 14-digit, come here!

116
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,134
Officer Shin Hyun-jin.

117
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,768
Fuck...

118
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,279
Buddy.

119
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,444
- Don't talk back, okay?
- Yes, sir!

120
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,919
- Watch it.
- Yes, sir!

121
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:38,531
What?

122
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,056
Sir, you should get
a designated driver...

123
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,060
No problem, good night!

124
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:50,199
Yo 14-digit!
It's all your fault!

125
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,000
Boys, that's enough!

126
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,618
You're all fucked.

127
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,622
What the hell happened here?!

128
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,893
What brings you here
past midnight?

129
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:18,797
You're accusing a mourner
over some money without context?

130
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,867
IAD isn't run by humans?

131
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,770
We're only following our orders.

132
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:23,865
Ship out.

133
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,677
Come back after the funeral.

134
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,805
Don't just stand there,
pack up!

135
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:31,945
This here is a list,

136
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:37,056
of those who took bribes
from local businesses.

137
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,855
I said pack up!

138
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:40,822
Doh Hee-chul, $1,000,

139
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,956
Choi Sang-ho, $3,500,
Ko Gun-su, $3,500,

140
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,494
and over 10 grand...

141
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,866
You're on a different level,
chief.

142
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:00,039
DET. CHOI - RAIDED BY THE IAD.
ANSWER THE DAMN PHONE!

143
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,149
SISTER

144
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,192
What? What now?

145
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:24,760
What's with you?!
What's taking so long?!

146
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:27,006
Just let me be!

147
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,004
Let you be?
Mom's getting prepped!

148
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,177
We need you here!
Get here now!

149
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,709
Fuck, everything's just perfect!

150
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:16,887
Daddy, your foot!

151
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:22,958
Hey, sweetie.

152
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:25,931
Why aren't you sleeping?

153
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,924
I already did.
Where's the cake?

154
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:30,758
Sorry, I...

155
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,731
I'll buy you next time, okay?

156
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,174
Mina, I'm sorry.
I...

157
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,998
Make room in the grave for us too.

158
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,596
I'm sorry sir.

159
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:06,869
Chief...

160
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,703
I'm sorry,
but could we do this later?

161
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,505
Yo, Ko Gun-su!

162
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,910
Shouldn't you at least pretend to
take some responsibility for this?

163
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,577
What?

164
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:29,553
Wait...

165
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:31,762
You want me to...

166
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,199
take the heat for you all?

167
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,566
While grieving?

168
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,873
What a fucking timing!

169
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,203
I'm sorry, we really are.

170
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:50,074
But we all can't go down.
This should end with you.

171
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,750
I'll take care of you,
so don't worry.

172
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,445
Take care of me?!
Cover your own ass!

173
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,185
You're not getting out of this!

174
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:01,059
Even your brothel trips
are on record!

175
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:02,918
'Ms. Autumn' is your regular, right?

176
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,758
Motherfucker, are you nuts?!

177
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,422
Yeah, fuckhead!
I wish I was mental!

178
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,200
- Fuck you man!
- Come at me!

179
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,336
- Hey, hey!
- Let's go!

180
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,065
Gun-su!

181
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,910
Mother's ready for casket.

182
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:32,656
My condolences.

183
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,558
Take care, sir.

184
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:43,992
License plate 2644,
please move your car.

185
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,065
It's designated for the hearse

186
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:49,342
Please do not park there.

187
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,106
The unit was raided,
couldn't even find an envelope.

188
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:56,942
Give her a good send off.

189
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,948
Insert any of her personal items
you'd like to put in.

190
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:46,796
We'll hammer the nails
in this order.

191
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,364
Mother!

192
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,816
DET. NAM:
RATS ARE HEADING THERE

193
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,945
MIGHT SEARCH THE CAR,
ANYTHING INSIDE?

194
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:17,421
- Mr. Ko?
- Yes?

195
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:36,382
License plate 2644,
please move your car.

196
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,866
CHAPEL OF THE REST

197
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,914
Where are you going?!

198
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:14,186
Gun-su!

199
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:21,926
What's that there?

200
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,326
Isn't that Gun-su?

201
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:28,296
What's with him?

202
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,997
Chief, let's dig into the IAD guys.

203
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,431
We need leverage.

204
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:38,434
I doubt there's anything,
they're IAD after all.

205
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,439
Come on, Internal Affairs is
still police.

206
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,914
Don't overestimate Korean cops.

207
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,255
Sir?

208
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:28,119
Sir, I'd like some private moment
with my mother one last time.

209
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,292
But...

210
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:33,694
that's rather unusual.

211
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:36,691
Okay.

212
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,034
- Until midnight.
- Thank you.

213
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,479
By the way,
what's that for?

214
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,483
These are for my daughter.

215
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:54,713
I see.

216
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,017
Thank you again.

217
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:25,080
I'm sorry, mom.

218
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:49,231
EFFECTIVE RANGE: 3M

219
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,240
Dammit!

220
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,073
Holy fuck...

221
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:52,956
Shit...

222
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,510
I'm a terrible son,
I'll make it up to you...

223
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,221
Anyone inside?

224
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:22,394
Did you hear that,
just now?

225
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:24,559
I'm not sure.

226
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,866
Security 1, security 1.

227
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,772
Yeah, this is the security office.

228
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:37,238
Could you check something
on the security feed?

229
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:41,279
I'm outside the chapel,
I got a report of disturbance.

230
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:44,939
Huh?
What the heck?

231
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,317
Can't see inside.
Have to go in and check.

232
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,680
Is the key there?

233
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:57,256
I'll ask the funeral director
to check it out now.

234
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,765
Okay, thank you.

235
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,434
Will you stay and wait?

236
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:03,702
Not really.

237
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:04,863
- Let's go then.
- Okay.

238
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:40,762
Stay there!

239
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:50,876
Thank you.

240
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,580
Mom, I'll get him out soon.

241
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:56,070
I'm so sorry.

242
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,547
What the hell?

243
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:17,994
Give me a break!

244
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,699
Please, not yet!

245
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,706
I'm begging you!

246
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:35,845
Hang up! Please!
I'm so close!

247
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,008
Mom, mom, please, do something!

248
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,454
Hang up! Hang up!
Please!

249
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:01,606
It's time, Mr. Ko...

250
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,234
Okay.

251
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,244
- Mr. Ko?
- Yes?

252
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:06,097
My Lord is always nearby...

253
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:12,610
Why is this so heavy?

254
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,613
Careful, go slowly.

255
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,545
Mother...

256
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:32,628
Mom, I'm sorry!

257
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:34,822
I'll be back soon.

258
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:37,095
What a great son.

259
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:42,140
- Mother!
- Gun-su!

260
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,606
Great son indeed.

261
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,978
Gun-su, we should go now.

262
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:03,888
Hey, hey!

263
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:05,763
What's this?

264
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:06,389
It's...

265
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:09,326
Some bastard stole
her toy soldier!

266
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:10,897
I'll snap that bastard's neck!

267
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:16,207
She was wailing so I got it
from the hospital shop,

268
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:17,002
it's not expensive.

269
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:18,171
Hospital shop?

270
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,116
It's pretty fast.

271
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:30,747
Mina, that's enough,
I'm gonna get mad.

272
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,990
IAD backed off quite easily.

273
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:39,388
They confiscated the money
and called it quits.

274
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,829
We all went to great lengths
to save your ass.

275
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:45,368
We're the best, aren't we?

276
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,834
Thank you,
I'll see you tomorrow.

277
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,633
Okay, I understand.

278
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,848
Mister, get out.

279
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:35,819
Are you drunk?

280
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,155
Good afternoon.
Western District Det. Ko.

281
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:43,790
Why did you park
on a right-turn lane?

282
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:53,894
You know better.

283
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:58,866
This is a recently confiscated
homemade C4,

284
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,979
the explosive yield is tremendous,

285
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:03,480
and can be remotely detonated.

286
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:07,951
So desperate to make an impression
on the new commissioner.

287
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,178
Not too many reporters.

288
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:12,723
It detonates 2 minutes after
pushing this button.

289
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:14,959
We'll start the demonstration.

290
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:17,392
DEMONSTRATION OF I.E.D.

291
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:21,996
We'll also blow 4 societal evils
as part of our campaign

292
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,090
with the bomb.

293
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:24,494
Armed.

294
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,439
Det. Ko's back.

295
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,702
Afternoon.

296
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:30,939
Sent her off well?

297
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:32,210
Yes.

298
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,041
It all worked out in the end.

299
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:36,473
- An emotional turmoil, eh?
- Thanks to you.

300
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:41,347
Don't be sarcastic,
Choi took care of the mess.

301
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:43,248
Nice, eh?
You owe me a dinner.

302
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:45,818
Fine.

303
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:47,516
How's Ms. Autumn?

304
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,518
Goddammit!

305
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,325
Ask this fucker,
fucking newbie.

306
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:55,924
Careful, they'll be
on your ass again soon.

307
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,265
Looks like it'll go off now.

308
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,397
Making a fuss
over some fireworks.

309
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,304
Holy fuck!

310
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:07,508
- That was huge!
- Someone's fucked.

311
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,071
Holy shit!

312
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,538
Chief, look...

313
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:13,376
Isn't that your new car?

314
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:14,877
Your Grandeur!

315
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,784
Goddamn son of a bitch!

316
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:19,246
They should've been more careful...

317
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,187
Why isn't the key working?

318
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:25,229
Here.

319
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,297
What's this?

320
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:28,789
Cold cases, and cases nearing
statute of limitations,

321
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:30,160
we're told to focus on these.

322
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:31,269
Why?

323
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,033
Probably our punishment.

324
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:35,231
Fuckers...

325
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:36,941
Suit up!

326
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,043
- We got a tip.
- What?

327
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:43,478
Lee Gwang-min.

328
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:46,208
The very definition of a killer's face.

329
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,851
WANTED FOR MURDER

330
00:34:58,596 --> 00:34:59,393
- What are you doing?
- What?

331
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:01,865
- Let's go!
- Okay.

332
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,920
This fucker was a front for
bars and brothels,

333
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:30,254
he's suspected of killing
2 of his competitors.

334
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:33,124
This'll not only get us off the hook
but promotions too.

335
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:36,396
If we get him, you cuff him,
I'll let you have this.

336
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,228
I'm the best, eh?

337
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,453
Fucking dog...

338
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:02,322
Chief, maybe it was a prank call.

339
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,084
No, I can feel it.

340
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,324
Sir, I don't think he's here either.

341
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:11,161
Where is he then?

342
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,633
Who... knows?

343
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:17,206
Get your gun out!

344
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:20,842
Hey!

345
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:23,179
Police! Freeze!

346
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,680
What the hell?
No one's here.

347
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,551
Dammit!

348
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,454
Chief, take a look!

349
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:42,424
So he did live here.

350
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:46,233
Maybe he got tipped off.

351
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,335
Let's look around
for any evidence.

352
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,107
Okay.

353
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:56,113
Where could this fucker be?

354
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:05,742
What are you doing there?

355
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,591
Central District officer Lee Jin-ho.

356
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:15,426
What's up?

357
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,190
I was checking up
on a car accident report.

358
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:21,325
This must be it.

359
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,038
Any injuries?

360
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:28,772
The report says,

361
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,232
hit-and-run victim was
carried off in the trunk.

362
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,677
When? Today?

363
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,282
No, a few days ago.

364
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,113
On the night of 21st?

365
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,520
Who was the tipper?

366
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,183
It was from a pay phone,
hung up before we could get ID.

367
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:50,820
Det. Ko!
Find anything?

368
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:53,695
- Officer Lee!
- Salute!

369
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,389
Hey man!

370
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,768
Remember Lt. Park
who helped us on the IAD matter?

371
00:38:58,135 --> 00:38:59,535
- He's in Park's unit.
- Yeah?

372
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:00,397
What are you doing?

373
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:05,334
It's a hit-and-run,
the perp left with the body.

374
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,510
Oh yeah?

375
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,603
Brass balls on that one.

376
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:09,278
Find anything?

377
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:13,742
I have to check
the security cam feed.

378
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:19,819
Good, we should take a look too.

379
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:22,460
Maybe Lee makes a cameo.

380
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,059
Sure.

381
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:25,556
- Go follow up on it.
- Okay.

382
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,191
Chief, I can do that,
I'll check it out.

383
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:30,566
- Yeah?
- Sure.

384
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:33,137
- Nah. Choi, you do it.
- Okay.

385
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,296
No, allow me.

386
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,871
Buy Park a round of
drinks afterwards.

387
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:39,107
You don't know him anyway.

388
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,111
I've been away too long,
I don't mind.

389
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:41,879
I'll take care of it.

390
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,139
I need to take some photos.

391
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:45,680
- Yeah? I'll meet you later.
- Okay.

392
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,048
See you soon.

393
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:53,524
Is that so?

394
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:55,653
A big fat raincheck then.

395
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:57,189
Great.

396
00:39:58,262 --> 00:39:59,787
Today was perfect.

397
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:02,630
What brings you here?

398
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:05,503
Evening, sir.

399
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:08,166
What's got into you?
I love you, man.

400
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:09,068
Snack time.

401
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,172
- Anything?
- Not a thing.

402
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:20,748
How's the hit-and-run case?

403
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:22,879
The video quality is bad,

404
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:26,286
and this must be the spot,
but nothing yet.

405
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,524
Bad quality, huh?

406
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:32,594
- Officer Lee.
- Yes, sir?

407
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:33,490
Let's eat.

408
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:34,699
Come on, take a break.

409
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,562
Wait, rewind a bit.

410
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,200
Sir?

411
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,701
The video, rewind it.

412
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:46,403
Play.

413
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:51,279
Right there.

414
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:55,477
A frame forward.

415
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,386
There! That's it!

416
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:02,550
- Brake lights!
- What about it?

417
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,556
Other cars just drove off,
but why'd this car brake here?

418
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,562
Because something popped up,
so he braked!

419
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:10,596
What happened next?

420
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,300
Bang!

421
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:13,636
Where's the accident point?

422
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:18,808
- About here.
- See?

423
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,437
Made impact here,

424
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:22,980
and he fell on this spot.

425
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,609
Look, that bitch.

426
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:26,239
The mutt's watching something.

427
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:28,979
Which means,
something happened here.

428
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:32,284
This is the night of 21st.
The car type is...

429
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:35,355
It's Lotze, definitely.

430
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,125
A black one.

431
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:38,157
Wait!

432
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:39,562
- You got a Lotze, right?
- What?

433
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:40,590
Is this a Lotze?

434
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:43,498
Yeah...

435
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:44,496
The plate is...

436
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:48,566
That's an 8, first one.

437
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,508
Gun-su, looks like an 8, right?

438
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:52,471
8

439
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,744
- More like 3.
- It is indeed 8!

440
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,442
Left side is kinda visible too.

441
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:02,281
It's 8!

442
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:04,085
Next one is...

443
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:18,401
I can't tell.

444
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:20,028
Can't see shit.

445
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:29,971
Are we still going away
for the weekend?

446
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,372
For Mina's birthday.

447
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:33,917
We are,
I told you already.

448
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:36,011
Gun-su.

449
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:39,455
I wanna talk about something,
don't be mad, okay?

450
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:46,753
Can't we kick out our shop tenant
and open a toast shop there?

451
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:49,293
I'm told snack shops
do well there!

452
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,058
I'll pay the full rent!

453
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:53,403
We can't kick them out
before lease's up.

454
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,539
But you're a cop.

455
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:56,000
Cops aren't gangsters!

456
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,942
Come on, let me.
Please?

457
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:03,775
We can't live off you forever.

458
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:04,576
Ow! Hot!

459
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:06,546
Again?

460
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:08,344
You okay?

461
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:09,617
Yeah.

462
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:13,316
I gotta do something about
that shower head.

463
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,321
It's a great idea,
don't you think?

464
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:16,594
Let's talk later, okay?

465
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,493
- By the way.
- What now!

466
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:28,361
Did mom have a man?

467
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:30,568
What are you saying?

468
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,970
I went to a fortuneteller yesterday,

469
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:36,040
and he said mom had a man.

470
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:37,845
By her side, even now.

471
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:40,818
What?

472
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:43,982
It's weird,
he got everything else right.

473
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:49,593
About his failed flower shop,
even your divorce.

474
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:53,358
Maybe mom did have a lover.

475
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,824
What? She did?

476
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:58,926
Yeah, I guess.

477
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:01,003
Wow, that's awesome!

478
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:02,400
Isn't it?

479
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:08,639
NATIONAL LISTING OF
BLACK LOTZE OWNERS

480
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,079
KO GUN-SU

481
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,148
Western District homicide.

482
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:25,494
Good afternoon,
I'd like to report a wanted man.

483
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:26,631
One moment please.

484
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:29,693
Go ahead.

485
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:31,935
I saw Lee Gwang-min.

486
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,104
What? Who?

487
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,565
I saw Lee Gwang-min.

488
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,442
Listen, mister.

489
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:46,049
Don't make prank calls, okay?

490
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,924
Western District homicide.

491
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:00,463
I think it's the same dude.

492
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,393
What is it?

493
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,966
He's asking for you.

494
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:09,637
What is it?
I said don't prank call!

495
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,209
I wanted to make a report,
why is that a prank?

496
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:16,708
Fine, let's hear it.

497
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:20,450
Like I said,
I saw Lee Gwang-min.

498
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:22,815
Where is he now then?

499
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,213
That's what I wanted to ask you.

500
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:27,724
Are you jerking me off?
What a guy.

501
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:30,693
No, I mean, where did you
take him, Det. Ko?

502
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:31,725
Say what?

503
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:34,929
Did he fly into the sunset
or dug himself into the earth?

504
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,659
Black Lotze's Ko Gun-su.

Yes.

508
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:05,029
Det. Ko.

509
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:06,263
Yeah?

510
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,561
He wants you to
answer your phone.

511
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:10,300
What?

512
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,495

The one who knows
you killed Lee.

516
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:38,893
Sleeping fine after killing a man?

517
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:42,800
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

518
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,397
Who are you?

519
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:48,237
Det. Ko, you're beginning to
look pathetic.

520
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:56,203
I think you're gravely
mistaken about something.

521
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:59,674
Wow, nice job fixing your car.

522
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:00,810
You've been busy.

523
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:04,847
Oh that...

524
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:10,994
I had a minor collision
that my insurance took care of.

525
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:15,758
You got it all wrong, right?

526
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:19,265
- Already got an alibi?
- I'm hanging up now.

527
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:22,162
Should I report that Lee was
spotted at Mt. Yangja?

528
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:24,335
I hope you buried him well.

529
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:27,601
That never happened,
so stop calling, motherfucker!

530
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:30,680
I'll report when you hang up.

531
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:35,310
See? You killed him.

532
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:36,745
Son of a bitch!

533
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:40,154
Tell me,
who are you?

534
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:41,789
I've had it!

535
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:45,192
Swear at me once more,
I'll report.

536
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:46,396
Got your attention?

537
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:48,297
- Salute!
- Salute!

538
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:52,767
You're not in the right
mindset to listen.

539
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:56,907
I'll let you sweat a bit
and tell you my demands.

540
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:02,638
And don't bother looking for me,
I'll report if you annoy me.

541
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:05,840
You look better than I expected.

542
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:07,940
Must not feel guilt.

543
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:09,781
Great attitude.

544
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,925
What the hell!

545
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,236
The light's green,
why aren't you going?!

546
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:15,340
Shall we... go?

547
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:16,970
Mister.

548
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:21,347
I said $10 per second.

549
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,984
You already made...

550
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:28,755
$150, $160,
wow, $200.

- What's wrong?
- Huh?

557
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:54,094
Had a nightmare?

558
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:56,467
Were you napping?

559
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,302
We've been hiking all day.

560
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:00,336
Where were you?

561
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:01,407
Mt. Yangja.

562
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:04,272
Isn't your mother buried there?

563
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:06,011
Yeah.

564
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:08,484
Wait.

565
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,019
Why there?

566
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:14,117
Lee's cell phone's last
known location was there,

567
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:17,486
but due to network overlap,
we didn't get a pinpoint location.

568
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,020
The car looks new,
did you replace the bumper?

569
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:21,598
Had an accident?

570
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:24,564
Yeah, I told you about that.

571
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:26,370
Right.

572
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:27,534
Replaced the whole front?

573
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,173
Good thing you weren't hurt.

574
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:32,465

00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:02,700
Did you give it a thought?
Can we talk now?

578
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:05,639
- I have a question.
- Okay.

579
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:08,438
How did you see me...

580
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:14,743
burying Lee?
It was pitch dark.

581
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,721
Dark? Doesn't mean I can't.

582
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:19,646
Let's not get sidetracked.

583
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:20,724
You didn't see it yourself.

584
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:23,352
You don't know where Lee is.

585
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:29,289
Then...

586
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:35,304
whether you report,
or start digging,

587
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,468
go right ahead.

588
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:40,677
But you'll never find him.

589
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:42,575
Why?

590
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:45,544
There's no proof that
he was buried, asshole!

591
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:48,377
There's no proof,
you fucking asshole!

592
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:50,542
I'm done, fucker!

596
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,043
Answer the damn phone.

00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:22,345
- Dinner anyone?
- Western District...

598
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,382
- Sure, I'm friggin' starving.
- One moment...

599
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:26,651
He wants to report a car accident.

600
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:28,088
- Then transfer to traffic.
- Hey, hey, hey!

601
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,654
- It's a prank call.
- Yeah?

602
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:46,674
What is it?

603
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:50,273
We've been getting
prank calls all afternoon.

604
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:55,209
Prank calling should be fined,
that'll teach them.

605
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:56,351
Go eat, go on.

606
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:57,418
Sure.

607
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:03,484
They'll bitch at us
for not answering later.

608
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:05,423
What a headache.

609
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:42,126
Hey, hey!

610
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,224
Stop it!
What's wrong?!

611
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:45,530
What's going on?!

612
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:49,331
How dare you ignore my calls!
Shall I expose you?!

613
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:50,266
What's wrong?!

614
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:54,343
What's with you?

615
00:56:56,613 --> 00:56:57,672
Shit, it's not him?

616
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:00,316
No, no, no.

617
00:57:00,316 --> 00:57:01,807
What, wrong man?

618
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:03,852
He's our colleague.

619
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:07,418
- A cop?
- Yeah, a cop.

620
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:11,189
Fuck, I've gone mental.

621
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:13,160
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

622
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:14,922
You looked like
the man who conned me.

623
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:17,164
I'm sorry, truly.

624
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:21,701
Chief, this is Lt. Park,
who helped us on the IAD matter.

625
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:26,743
Lieutenant, so good to meet you,
we owe you.

626
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:29,872
This is our savior!

627
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,880
Gun-su, you got a beat
from our savior.

628
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:35,284
- Det. Ko Gun-su?
- Yeah.

629
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:36,318
Seriously?

630
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:37,519
I don't believe this.

631
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:40,550
I hope you're not bleeding.

632
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:44,326
I'm sorry again,
let me formally introduce myself.

633
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:46,288
I'm Park Chang-min.

634
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:49,629
Something about you two.

635
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:52,769
Saved you last time,
almost killed you today.

636
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:55,833
You got a great face.

637
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:59,504
Hold on,
let's see here...

638
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:03,845
I'm sorry.

639
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:05,277
Gonna visit the toilet.

640
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,222
Almost had a heart attack.

641
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:16,756
That's Lt. Park?

642
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:18,662
Yeah.

643
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:40,807
You startled me.

644
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:49,790
There are 2 types of humans.

645
00:58:51,427 --> 00:58:53,726
One who lowers his tail
before the alpha.

646
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:58,997
And the one who tries hard
after a beat.

647
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:00,869
Which one are you?

648
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:10,344
You're a cop?

649
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:13,574
Didn't I give you a jolt?
That sinking feeling.

650
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:17,043
What do you want?

651
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:23,821
That was the most important
and smart thing you've ever said.

652
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:27,622
What I want?
It's simple.

653
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:31,767
Bring Lee.
No questions.

654
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,059
Why?

655
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,909
Curiosity killed the cat.

656
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:44,479
Let's not mince words,
just get him.

657
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:48,683
That's too bad though.

658
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:54,082
I really don't know where he is.

659
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:04,559
Not good.

660
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:25,383
Motherfucker!

661
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,085
Wait, wait, wait.

662
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,487
You pack a punch.

663
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:36,695
A cop shouldn't hit another cop.

664
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:38,930
You got a mean hook.

665
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:43,537
If your hook hurts this much,

666
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,667
imagine Lee's pain
when you ran him over.

667
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:48,474
Dammit!

668
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:53,049
Come out!

669
01:00:56,686 --> 01:00:57,949
Come out, asshole!

670
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:13,759
Connecting a few jabs
got your ego through the roof?

671
01:01:19,575 --> 01:01:21,441
You okay?
Still breathing.

672
01:01:26,482 --> 01:01:28,713
This is too gay for my taste.

673
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:30,687
Hold still.

674
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:40,460
Take it easy,
drink up.

675
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,559
I'll get him!

676
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:49,432
I'll get him!
I will!

677
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:56,508
Now we're seeing eye to eye.

678
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:01,709
Dang it.

679
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:15,090
Get Lee ready by tonight.

680
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:21,967
I'll call.

681
01:03:10,653 --> 01:03:11,416
Fuck...

682
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:14,614
There has to be a reason.

683
01:03:16,192 --> 01:03:18,821
Why is he looking for a dead man?

684
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:24,534
Give me a break!

685
01:03:33,776 --> 01:03:34,539
What's this?

686
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:47,587
Bullet holes...

687
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:52,295
He was already dead?

688
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:37,839
Who's there?

689
01:05:02,265 --> 01:05:03,699
That bitch...

690
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:21,149
PRIVATE PIGGY BANK

691
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:34,026
Yo, Gwang-min!
Why's it so hard to reach you?!

692
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:36,958
I thought Lt. Park
got to you already.

693
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:38,859
Where are you?

694
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:39,962
Why aren't you answ...

695
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:44,097
You're not him...
Who are you?

696
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:54,240
38-years old,
Jo Neung-hyun.

697
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:57,452
3 prior convictions,

698
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:01,253
from the same town as Lee,
probably worked together.

699
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:03,386
Triangulate him
at 1-minute interval,

700
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:09,197
and send his mugshot
and current location to my phone!

701
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,798
Sir, that's illegal.

702
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:13,927
I need to get a warrant and...

703
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:16,471
Warrant my ass!
Time's ticking!

704
01:06:17,073 --> 01:06:18,166
Just send it,
I'll take the heat!

705
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:21,305
- Det. Ko?
- Yes, sir.

706
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:22,400
Where is he?

707
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:24,736
I'm not sure.

708
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:28,049
Where is that son of a bitch
roaming around?

709
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:29,910
What's this?

710
01:06:30,786 --> 01:06:32,880
Those are our unit's traffic tickets.

711
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:35,081
I wanted to take care of it
before we're fined.

712
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:37,152
- Mine?
- No...

713
01:06:37,259 --> 01:06:38,227
Gun-su's, eh?

714
01:06:40,763 --> 01:06:41,389
$120.

715
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,364
Like a bat out of hell.

716
01:06:58,381 --> 01:06:59,815
JO NEUNG-HYUN

717
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:32,647
Motherfucker!

718
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:38,581
Stop!

719
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:49,865
Asshole, I'm not here for you!

720
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:52,231
Let's just chat!

721
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:54,871
Stop right there!

722
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:01,807
Hey!

723
01:08:03,212 --> 01:08:04,145
Buddy, you okay?!

724
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:08,213
Watch out for the cars!

725
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:09,914
Is he nuts?!

726
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:11,612
Stop!

727
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:15,522
Fucking...

728
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:20,585
What a fucking moron...

729
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:23,589
I just want to talk...

730
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:27,298
I really don't know!

731
01:08:27,403 --> 01:08:29,031
All I want to know is...

732
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:33,407
the reason why
Park's looking for Lee.

733
01:08:33,509 --> 01:08:35,410
I don't know, I swear!

734
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:38,344
Please let me go, okay?

735
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:42,113
You really don't?

736
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:43,581
I don't! Fuck you!

737
01:08:48,524 --> 01:08:49,924
Fine, just go.

738
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:51,089
Thank you.

739
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:53,360
Go.

740
01:08:54,196 --> 01:08:55,220
Step forward.

741
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:58,093
- Go on.
- Wait!

742
01:08:58,367 --> 01:08:59,926
- Keep going.
- I can't!

743
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:01,226
To your next life.

744
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:03,333
Forward.

745
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,640
- Go ahead.
- Don't untie it!

746
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:07,505
Don't untie, you assho...
Please!

747
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:09,238
Step forward,
I'm letting you go!

748
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:10,335
I'll talk! I'll tell you!

749
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,241
I'll fucking talk!

750
01:09:12,548 --> 01:09:15,575
Don't swear motherfucker!
Don't fucking swear!

751
01:09:16,218 --> 01:09:16,913
I'll tell you.

752
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:25,219
Lee stole Park's key.

753
01:09:27,129 --> 01:09:28,028
Key?

754
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,299
To a private safe.
Park's key.

755
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:32,056
What's inside?

756
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:35,136
Talk, asshole!

757
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:38,435
Fuck! I'm so fucking scared!
Son of a bitch!

758
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:42,508
From the beginning,
speak concisely!

759
01:09:42,978 --> 01:09:43,445
I'll talk.

760
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:46,279
- Don't make me ask you again.
- Okay, I'll talk.

761
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:50,310
The drugs that Park brought in...

762
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:53,555
- Drugs?
- Yes.

763
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:59,391
When Park was in vice squad,

764
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:03,624
he snatched the confiscated drugs.

765
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:40,533
I hear tons of drugs get
confiscated by the customs,

766
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:45,507
he sold some off,
and ran bars and clubs with it.

767
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:48,133
It was a mega hit.

768
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:50,603
Once you taste it,
you can never go back.

769
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:53,342
You'll become
a permanent regular.

770
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:57,447
Even the Yakuza wanted
a piece of it.

771
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:02,082
Park was a major player
in this scene.

772
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:26,306
When Park went to sign a deal
with Yakuza, Lee took off.

773
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:28,647
With the money and drugs.

774
01:11:31,153 --> 01:11:33,088
So where's the key now?

775
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:36,482
Lee keeps anything important
on his body.

776
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:38,427
Inside.

777
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:55,304
What the hell am I doing?

778
01:11:57,813 --> 01:11:58,803
So nasty!

779
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:01,409
Fuck!

780
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:24,639
Ko Gun-su!
Stay there!

781
01:12:25,441 --> 01:12:26,670
Don't move.

782
01:12:29,111 --> 01:12:30,272
What the fuck man?!

783
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,145
Drop the knife!

784
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:34,112
- Listen...
- Drop the knife!

785
01:12:34,316 --> 01:12:35,184
Come on, man.

786
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:36,174
Drop the fucking knife!

787
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:38,277
Just relax.

788
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:43,525
Back off.

789
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:45,194
Hey, hey!

790
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:45,752
I... I didn't do this.

791
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,390
Then why are you here!

792
01:12:47,496 --> 01:12:48,759
I didn't! I didn't kill him!

793
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:49,858
What happened is...

794
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,460
You have to believe me!

795
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:54,392
Here, take a look.

796
01:12:55,237 --> 01:12:57,297
You had the accident on 23rd.

797
01:12:57,706 --> 01:12:59,197
This is from 2 days earlier.

798
01:13:00,175 --> 01:13:02,838
Your car was already wrecked
before the accident.

799
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:05,277
Am I still wrong?
Am I?!

800
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:07,807
Alright, just lower your gun.

801
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:12,121
Hey! What are you doing?!

802
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:15,817
We're no model cops,
but you've gone too far!

803
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:18,784
Come on!
You got it all wrong!

804
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:20,819
Goddammit!

805
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:39,409
How did you end up like this?

806
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:40,808
Forget it,
just drop it.

807
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:46,582
I'll confess back at the station,
so let's go.

808
01:13:49,691 --> 01:13:51,319
I'm really tired today.

809
01:13:52,861 --> 01:13:56,628
Whatever happens,
I just wanna rest.

810
01:13:57,933 --> 01:13:58,559
Rest?

811
01:14:00,702 --> 01:14:01,294
You wanna rest?

812
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:05,573
Always so nonchalant.

813
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:11,480
Manslaughter and disposal of body
will get you near life.

814
01:14:11,747 --> 01:14:13,773
Who cares about you,
but your kid?

815
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:16,849
You drive me insane.

816
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:19,513
Absolutely insane.

817
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:29,223
Fuck it, I don't care.

818
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:31,964
Do whatever, it's up to you.

819
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:36,962
Take it.

820
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:39,305
Fuck it all.

821
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,914
Would I live comfortably
with you locked up?

822
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:49,348
You got an interesting fate.

823
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:52,811
Your mother's funeral is barely over,
and now this?

824
01:14:53,555 --> 01:14:54,352
Sang-ho.

825
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:56,249
Don't thank me,
I don't wanna hear it.

826
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:57,958
- Help me.
- What now?!

827
01:15:00,529 --> 01:15:02,293
I'm being blackmailed by a cop.

828
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:05,393
What's this nonsense?

829
01:15:05,934 --> 01:15:06,731
You know him.

830
01:15:07,936 --> 01:15:08,869
Park Chang-min.

831
01:15:09,605 --> 01:15:13,235
I think he killed Lee too.

832
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:19,279
That corpse up there,
that's Lee.

833
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:26,985
You have to believe
everything I tell you, okay?

834
01:15:29,758 --> 01:15:30,589
That night...

835
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:34,796
I did hit someone.

836
01:15:36,765 --> 01:15:37,562
Hold on.

837

UNKNOWN CALLER ID

838
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:49,545
Hello?

839
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:50,911
It's me,
is Det. Choi with you?

840
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,107
What?

841
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:55,348
Get out,
this is important.

842
01:15:57,519 --> 01:15:58,885
Are you watching us now?

843
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:03,449
If you don't want to be
a burden on him, get out.

844
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:09,623
What is it?!

845
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:13,364
You like being a peeping tom?

846
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:19,672
Shut up and come to the street
in front of you.

847
01:16:20,642 --> 01:16:21,666
5 more steps forward.

848
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:27,012
- There?
- Yes, where are you?

849
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:28,782
Okay.

850
01:16:30,118 --> 01:16:31,586
Hello? Hello!

851
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:33,217
Hey!

852
01:16:35,857 --> 01:16:36,722
Son of a bitch...

UNKNOWN CALLER ID

854
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:23,735
How was the aim?
The driver's good eh?

855
01:17:24,673 --> 01:17:25,971
Chatting up is all but over.

856
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:29,443
Dig up Lee by 6 a.m.

857
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:32,977
What have you done?

858
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:38,612
I told you I'd bring him, fucker!

859
01:17:39,421 --> 01:17:40,047
Are you crying?

860
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:44,960
Didn't know you were emotional,
focus on the work.

861
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:46,156
Buddy.

862
01:17:50,465 --> 01:17:51,066
It's off.

863
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:54,833
I'm turning myself in.
You're finished too, motherfucker!

864
01:17:56,872 --> 01:17:58,841
You're finished!

865
01:17:59,474 --> 01:18:01,568
Yeah?
Hold on a minute.

866
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:04,046
Who is it?

867
01:18:04,046 --> 01:18:06,538
It's Lt. Park,
I called earlier.

868
01:18:07,616 --> 01:18:08,208
Oh, hello.

869
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:09,681
Good to see you.

870
01:18:10,552 --> 01:18:12,987
- Gun-su's not here yet.
- It's him on the phone.

871
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:15,582
- I'm at your house now.
- Don't you dare!

872
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:17,754
Wait inside?

873
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:20,629
I see, hurry now.

874
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,556
Hi, you must be Mina!

875
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:26,027
Don't! Please don't!

876
01:18:44,853 --> 01:18:45,616
Welcome home.

877
01:18:46,254 --> 01:18:46,744
Hey.

878
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:49,650
Mina's sleeping.

879
01:18:59,101 --> 01:18:59,591
Hey!

880
01:19:02,838 --> 01:19:03,828
What's wrong with you?

881
01:19:04,606 --> 01:19:05,437
Wasn't...

882
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:10,204
Wasn't someone here?

883
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:11,643
Your friend...

884
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:14,811
He dropped off a toy,
he said he'd be back.

885
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:16,114
What?

886
01:19:42,544 --> 01:19:46,948
TURNING YOURSELF IN WON'T
END YOUR PROBLEM.

887
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:50,176
BRING LEE BY 6.

888
01:20:00,929 --> 01:20:01,897
Fucking hell...

889
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:20,146
I made hotel reservations,

890
01:20:20,882 --> 01:20:23,943
so when Mina wakes up,
you guys go on ahead.

891
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:25,279
Got it?

892
01:20:25,854 --> 01:20:26,685
You're not coming with?

893
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:29,715
I'll come as soon as
I finish work.

894
01:20:29,891 --> 01:20:30,790
When will that be?

895
01:20:31,626 --> 01:20:33,060
I'll be there ASAP,
so get there first!

896
01:20:35,063 --> 01:20:36,861
- Are you in trouble?
- Of course not.

897
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:40,295
Here, this is the reservation slip.

898
01:20:41,102 --> 01:20:42,161
Okay? I gotta go.

899
01:20:42,904 --> 01:20:46,068
5 blanks returned,
and here's 5 live rounds.

900
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:46,869
Okay.

901
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:51,204
Detective, could you
sign the release form?

902
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:53,674
It's not here...

903
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:55,146
One moment.

904
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:59,213
Detective, we ordered some food,

905
01:21:00,155 --> 01:21:01,589
would you like to join us?

906
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:05,255
Their sauce's a little different.

907
01:21:05,727 --> 01:21:06,751
It's so good.

908
01:21:25,814 --> 01:21:27,874
I'll give him back alright!

909
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:01,108
Slow down now.

910
01:22:03,285 --> 01:22:05,015
That's far enough.

911
01:22:08,156 --> 01:22:08,782
Bring the body over.

912
01:22:41,356 --> 01:22:42,380
Load him.

913
01:22:49,064 --> 01:22:50,396
Hold it, stay put.

914
01:22:50,932 --> 01:22:52,195
Look what we got here?

915
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:57,238
Hold still asshole!
Car key...

916
01:22:58,340 --> 01:22:59,899
Got anything else?

917
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:05,411
Well, look at this.

918
01:23:13,455 --> 01:23:14,923
Move aside.

919
01:23:40,281 --> 01:23:41,044
Still inside.

920
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:47,283
Those bullet holes,
did you shoot him?

921
01:23:48,456 --> 01:23:50,857
Yeah, about that.

922
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:52,759
Okay, I shot him,

923
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:55,793
then bam!
You ran him over.

924
01:23:57,399 --> 01:23:58,196
So who killed him?

925
01:24:00,135 --> 01:24:01,068
You? Or me?

926
01:24:02,904 --> 01:24:03,894
Okay, well...

927
01:24:04,172 --> 01:24:05,105
That's not very important.

928
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:08,339
Are we done here?

929
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,175
Need a receipt or something?

930
01:24:11,346 --> 01:24:12,279
I'm going.

931
01:24:17,185 --> 01:24:19,450
Wait, one last thing.

932
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:24,993
It's a blank.

933
01:24:26,261 --> 01:24:27,854
Hey, hey! Wait!

934
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:31,164
Look!

935
01:24:32,567 --> 01:24:35,230
I've been a fucking cop
for a decade!

936
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:38,097
Would I come here
without an insurance?!

937
01:24:39,007 --> 01:24:40,908
If you fucking kill me,

938
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:48,939
then a timed e-mail will be sent
to the station in the morning.

939
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:54,453
It contains details
of your drug dealings,

940
01:24:55,356 --> 01:24:57,188
illegal brothel operation!

941
01:24:57,392 --> 01:25:01,193
As well as the murders of
Lee and Det. Choi!

942
01:25:01,629 --> 01:25:03,598
I'm sure those are
just a few of your crimes,

943
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:08,127
but I bet $180 that you'll
at least get a life sentence!

944
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:09,928
I think you missed a few others.

945
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:12,464
Go ahead, shoot me!

946
01:25:15,076 --> 01:25:18,240
Are you gonna shoot?
Get it over with.

947
01:25:19,047 --> 01:25:20,913
If you won't,
then holster it, fucker!

948
01:25:22,283 --> 01:25:22,943
Time's ticking.

949
01:25:29,157 --> 01:25:30,090
Okay.

950
01:25:32,427 --> 01:25:34,896
Why would I kill you?

951
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:37,591
You're a useful guy,
why'd I do that?

952
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:40,962
We're on the same boat, right?

953
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:42,965
Let's work together.

954
01:25:44,939 --> 01:25:49,070
It's about time
you play with the big boys.

955
01:25:49,677 --> 01:25:51,612
You gotta live hard.
And raise Mina properly.

956
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:56,046
Damn, that was awesome.

957
01:25:57,218 --> 01:25:59,210
Take care, man.

958
01:26:16,371 --> 01:26:18,363
Why is that fucker
coming this way?!

959
01:26:30,485 --> 01:26:32,147
No, no, no!

960
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:35,988
Just keep going!

961
01:26:44,632 --> 01:26:45,156
Det. Ko.

962
01:26:46,534 --> 01:26:51,438
There's an amazing diner
no one knows near here.

963
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:54,134
I'll let you in on the secret.

964
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:56,276
- The soup there...
- I don't want it!

965
01:27:01,316 --> 01:27:02,375
Your loss.

966
01:30:25,186 --> 01:30:27,849
Yeah, I'm on my way.
What's Mina doing?

967
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:29,149
Hold on.

968
01:30:29,524 --> 01:30:31,652
Mina, it's daddy.

969
01:30:33,928 --> 01:30:36,523
Sweetie, it's dad.

970
01:30:36,631 --> 01:30:38,691
Did you eat
your birthday breakfast?

971
01:30:39,233 --> 01:30:40,428
Yes, I ate so much.

972
01:30:41,369 --> 01:30:45,864
While I'm not there,
be good to aunt and uncle.

973
01:30:45,973 --> 01:30:48,340
Have all your meals, okay?

974
01:30:48,876 --> 01:30:50,868
Okay. Get here fast, daddy.

975
01:30:51,846 --> 01:30:52,677
Sure, sweetie.

976
01:30:54,348 --> 01:30:55,441
Wait a little longer.

977
01:30:56,918 --> 01:30:58,216
Daddy, bye!

978
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:00,152
Yeah, bye bye.

979
01:31:00,621 --> 01:31:01,919
I love you, daddy!

980
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:05,893
- When's dad coming?
- Very soon.

981
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:08,256
- Oh yeah?
- Hey Mina...

982
01:31:20,341 --> 01:31:21,866
CHIEF

983
01:31:38,793 --> 01:31:39,783
Good, you were home.

984
01:31:42,930 --> 01:31:43,454
Thank you.

985
01:32:15,696 --> 01:32:16,356
Surprised?

986
01:32:21,002 --> 01:32:21,935
I was too.

987
01:32:27,508 --> 01:32:28,339
Come in.

988
01:32:31,445 --> 01:32:32,208
Come in.

989
01:33:00,675 --> 01:33:01,608
CHIEF

990
01:33:06,948 --> 01:33:08,382
MISSED CALL: CHIEF

991
01:33:13,621 --> 01:33:14,645
Son of a bitch!

992
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:36,573
Dead?

993
01:33:43,584 --> 01:33:45,553
Holy shit...

994
01:34:14,015 --> 01:34:15,643
Thanks to you asshole,

995
01:34:17,518 --> 01:34:19,009
I broke the diving record.

996
01:34:56,891 --> 01:34:58,086
What are you doing?

997
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:00,050
Come on out!

998
01:35:03,764 --> 01:35:05,960
Wanna go again?!

999
01:35:09,303 --> 01:35:11,738
Open this door, shithead!

1000
01:35:13,507 --> 01:35:14,372
Let's see...

1001
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:36,954
Goddammit!

1002
01:36:00,221 --> 01:36:01,814
What the fuck are you doing?!

1003
01:36:10,297 --> 01:36:12,960
You're fucking dead!

1004
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:26,709
Dammit!

1005
01:37:05,019 --> 01:37:07,079
Did you fly?

1006
01:37:29,043 --> 01:37:29,840
Come here, you fuck!

1007
01:37:34,248 --> 01:37:35,011
You're fucking dead!

1008
01:37:49,630 --> 01:37:50,359
You fuck!

1009
01:38:08,916 --> 01:38:10,612
You fuck!

1010
01:39:16,016 --> 01:39:16,915
Fuck off!

1011
01:40:51,011 --> 01:40:58,043
Theft and distribution of narcotics,
operating a brothel,

1012
01:40:58,485 --> 01:41:03,150
homicide of an officer,
hit-and-run, theft of evidence...

1013
01:41:04,525 --> 01:41:06,323
This will bury us all.

1014
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:09,792
Let's cover it up.

1015
01:41:10,130 --> 01:41:10,893
Sir?

1016
01:41:11,532 --> 01:41:13,262
What should we do with him?

1017
01:41:17,938 --> 01:41:22,239
Why so soon after
a new commissioner took office?

1018
01:41:23,977 --> 01:41:24,842
Chief Jang, right?

1019
01:41:25,879 --> 01:41:26,505
Yes, sir.

1020
01:41:27,915 --> 01:41:29,816
Can you take this to your grave?

1021
01:41:30,884 --> 01:41:31,442
For his sake.

1022
01:41:35,189 --> 01:41:37,021
Yes, I'll take it to my grave.

1023
01:41:39,159 --> 01:41:40,058
Good.

1024
01:41:50,938 --> 01:41:53,601
I understand how you feel,
but life isn't all about that.

1025
01:41:55,075 --> 01:41:59,137
A year flies by when you're
relaxing in the country.

1026
01:42:01,515 --> 01:42:04,212
Giving your severance to
Choi's mother is fine.

1027
01:42:05,052 --> 01:42:08,614
But what can you do
besides being a cop?

1028
01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:12,555
There're over 12,000 jobs
in this country.

1029
01:42:14,128 --> 01:42:15,096
I'll find something.

1030
01:42:17,998 --> 01:42:20,399
With you gone,
I got nobody!

1031
01:42:22,536 --> 01:42:23,697
Gun-su...

1032
01:42:24,004 --> 01:42:25,973
Remember when you became a cop?

1033
01:42:26,507 --> 01:42:28,100
You had 1 adamant goal.

1034
01:42:30,644 --> 01:42:31,339
Retirement with full benefits.

1035
01:42:32,112 --> 01:42:35,241
Yeah, the ultimate goal
of all civil servants.

1036
01:42:36,283 --> 01:42:37,273
Let's not lose focus.

1037
01:42:37,618 --> 01:42:40,213
I'll delay your resignation,
so come back soon.

1038
01:42:51,365 --> 01:42:51,957
I'm off.

1039
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:04,407
Sir, make a border of the mound,
make it strong.

1040
01:43:04,711 --> 01:43:05,508
So it can't be dug up.

1041
01:43:07,047 --> 01:43:09,710
It's not a king's tomb,
no one will dig it up.

1042
01:43:10,350 --> 01:43:12,080
Just make sure
it's strong and firm.

1043
01:43:12,352 --> 01:43:14,514
Your mother raised
her children well.

1044
01:43:15,222 --> 01:43:18,351
No one tends their parents'
graves this well nowadays.

1045
01:43:20,027 --> 01:43:21,120
I've noticed you before.

1046
01:43:21,695 --> 01:43:25,632
You're a good son,
a very good son.

1047
01:43:29,169 --> 01:43:30,102
Feels nice? "Good son."

1048
01:43:32,272 --> 01:43:35,367
With you out of work,
how will we live now?

1049
01:43:36,243 --> 01:43:37,040
What a life...

1050
01:43:40,047 --> 01:43:41,015
- Young-chul.
- Yes?

1051
01:43:41,114 --> 01:43:42,582
- Young-chul.
- Yes?

1052
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:44,582
Used truck? Why?

1053
01:43:47,421 --> 01:43:49,049
Toast shop you mentioned.

1054
01:43:50,190 --> 01:43:51,624
We should start with a snack car.

1055
01:43:52,693 --> 01:43:54,321
I'll talk to the chief about it,

1056
01:43:55,662 --> 01:43:58,996
we can park in front of
the station and feed the unis.

1057
01:43:59,499 --> 01:44:02,469
- Bro...
- Sir.

1058
01:44:03,103 --> 01:44:04,628
How many dicks work at the station?

1059
01:44:05,505 --> 01:44:07,133
- What?
- Officers, I mean.

1060
01:44:09,543 --> 01:44:12,445
Probably around 370-380 in total?

1061
01:44:14,147 --> 01:44:15,137
Let's see then.

1062
01:44:15,482 --> 01:44:21,388
$1.50 per toast,
low estimate of 250,

1063
01:44:21,388 --> 01:44:22,083
so in a day...

1064
01:44:25,525 --> 01:44:26,424
How much?

1065
01:44:26,593 --> 01:44:28,152
Dunno, I wasn't a math major.

1066
01:44:28,262 --> 01:44:29,992
Come on!

1067
01:44:31,398 --> 01:44:32,366
Let's pack up and go.

1068
01:44:32,733 --> 01:44:33,564
Mina!

1069
01:44:34,368 --> 01:44:36,462
Come up, say good bye
to grandma!

1070
01:44:38,305 --> 01:44:40,069
- Come up!
- Okay!

1071
01:44:44,411 --> 01:44:46,175
Say good bye to her.

1072
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:48,342
Good bye, grandma!

1073
01:44:48,615 --> 01:44:49,378
I'll come again.

1074
01:44:49,483 --> 01:44:51,145
Wipe your hands.
Toss that.

1075
01:44:51,385 --> 01:44:52,614
Very good.

1076
01:44:53,287 --> 01:44:54,778
Clean hands!

1077
01:45:17,744 --> 01:45:21,647
PRIVATE PIGGY BANK

1078
01:45:28,822 --> 01:45:30,154
Boss, we got a client.

1079
01:45:37,564 --> 01:45:39,430
Check him.

1080
01:45:40,767 --> 01:45:41,826
Okay.

1081
01:45:50,277 --> 01:45:51,006
Key!

1082
01:45:58,185 --> 01:45:59,118
It's ours.

1083
01:45:59,486 --> 01:46:00,317
Then show him in.

1084
01:46:02,656 --> 01:46:03,783
Shouldn't we check his ID?

1085
01:46:04,124 --> 01:46:06,684
Boy, if we did,
we'd be out of business.

1086
01:46:07,894 --> 01:46:10,090
- Withdrawing?
- Yes.

1087
01:46:10,697 --> 01:46:12,165
- How much of it?
- Everything.

1088
01:46:17,804 --> 01:46:20,433
I think the safe owner
gave you bad info.

1089
01:46:20,807 --> 01:46:21,775
What?

1090
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:28,676
Enter the passcode inside.

1091
01:47:22,602 --> 01:47:26,334
A HARD DAY

1092
01:47:26,406 --> 01:47:31,367
LEE Sun-kyun

1093
01:47:31,445 --> 01:47:36,349
