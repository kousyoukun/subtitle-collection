2
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,987
嘿,辛普森,看!
Hey, Simpson, look!

3
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:14,783
一个金块。
A gold nugget.

4
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,827
展示给我看!
Show me!

5
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,203
把它还给我。
Give it back to me.

6
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,758
你真讨厌，真倒霉。
You're a pain in the neck and you're out of luck.

7
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,802
这对你来说是件很糟糕的事。
It's a bad deal for you, showing up.

8
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,054
这对你来说是件坏事。
It's a bad deal for you.

9
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,981
- 车上有尸体。  - 尸体?
- There are corpses on that wagon. - Corpses?

10
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,362
有银行家。 让我们看看他说了什么。
There's the banker. Let's see what he says.

11
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,780
让他通过。
Let him through.

12
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,824
本森,可怜的东西!
It's Benson, poor thing!

13
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:10,412
我想提醒你，治安官，本森是我的朋友。
I'd like to remind you, Sheriff, that Benson was my friend.

14
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,415
不管他是不是，我总是绞死杀人犯。
Whether he was or not, I always hang murderers.

15
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:19,421
当然，如果你真的抓住他们。 我们需要行动，长官，不是言语。
Sure, if you actually catch them. We need actions, Sheriff, not words.

16
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:23,425
我们一直平静地生活在印第安溪，
We've always lived in peace in Indian Creek,

17
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,260
我们希望这种情况继续下去。
and we want that to continue.

18
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,012
霍夫曼是正确的。
Hoffman is right.

19
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,935
本森,你说呢?
Benson, you said?

20
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,230
是的，他来自内布拉斯加州。
Yes, he came from Nebraska.

21
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:43,278
他们说他有点疯狂，但我想所有的淘金者都是。
They say he was half-crazy, but I think all gold prospectors are.

22
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,863
不一定。
Not necessarily.

23
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:48,742
我希望我没有冒犯你。 你也在找金子吗?
I hope I haven't offended you. Are you looking for gold too?

24
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,953
是的，除了我在别人的口袋里找它。
Yes, except that I look for it in other people's pockets.

25
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,380
“别死。 我马上就回来。”
"Don't die yet. I'll be right back."

26
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,385
我们的承办人有幽默感。
Our undertaker has a sense of humor.

27
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,619
嗨,・佩格特。 你在这儿干什么?
Hi, Piggot. What are you doing around here?

28
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,832
漂亮的花。 谁支付?
Nice flowers. Who paid for them?

29
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:04,169
这是一个豪华的葬礼。
It's a luxury funeral.

30
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,547
花环成本20美元。
That wreath cost $20.

31
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,925
- 我问你谁买的! - 当有人付钱给我时，
- I asked you who paid for them! - When someone pays me,

32
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:14,763
我数钱，不问问题。
I count the money and don't ask questions.

33
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,640
谁支付你?
Who Paid you?

34
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:25,023
- 谁为葬礼付的钱?  - 我不知道。 我发誓我不知道。
- Who paid for the funeral? - I don't know. I swear I don't know.

35
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,111
说话,你这个老傻瓜!
Talk, you old fool!

36
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,530
我什么都不知道。
I don't know anything.

37
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,262
等待。
Wait.

38
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,066
你还有其他武器吗?
Do you have any other weapons?

39
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,028
是的，大炮，但我从来没带过。
Yes, a cannon, but I never bring it along.

40
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,247
把你的赌注,先生们。
Place your bets, gentlemen.

41
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,793
一个卡吗?
A card?

42
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,015
 - 把你的赌注。 - 13。
- Place your bets. - Thirteen.

43
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,392
19岁。
Nineteen.

44
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:47,647
我今晚在这张桌子上运气不好。
I'm having no luck at this table tonight.

45
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,899
跟我说说吧。 这房子总是赢家。
Tell me about it. The house always wins.

46
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,443
我再弹几下，然后就退出。
I'll play a few more hands, then quit.

47
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,036
21岁。 众议院获胜。
Twenty-one. The house wins.

48
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,832
当运气对你不利时，玩游戏有什么意义?
What's the point of playing when luck's against you?

49
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:10,461
运气并不是针对你。 是这位先生在操纵它。
Luck isn't against you. It's this gentleman who's manipulating it.

50
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,089
你在指责我作弊吗?
Are you accusing me of cheating?

51
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,550
是的。
Yes.

52
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,680
我给你两分钟把钱还给他们。
And I'm giving you two minutes to return their money to them.

53
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,526
半分钟浪费。
Half a minute wasted.

54
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,500
一分钟离开。
One minute left.

55
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,046
我给你一秒钟的时间来道歉。
And I'm giving you just one second to apologize.

56
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,767
更接近。
Come closer.

57
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,937
现在你得和老板打交道。
Now you'll have to deal with the boss.

58
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:21,950
必须把枪留在衣帽间里，皮格特。 你忘记了吗?
Guns must be left in the cloakroom, Piggot. Have you forgotten that?

59
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,912
我不喜欢记忆短的人。
I don't like people with short memories.

60
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:29,207
但是… 你和我是朋友。
But... you and I are friends.

61
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,252
我们是朋友。
We were friends.

62
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:43,554
多么奇怪的手表。 它不是银做的，是吗?
What a strange watch. It's not made of silver, is it?

63
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,516
这是铅做的。
It's made of lead.

64
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:50,353
我只在特殊场合才用银器。
I only use the silver one for special occasions.

65
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,522
嘿!
Hey!

66
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,696
在你和我之间，Piggot是一个非常聪明的骗子。
Between you and me, Piggot is a very clever cheat.

67
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,992
如果你了解他，你一定是个好球员。
You must be a good player if you figured him out.

68
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,620
我邀请你和我玩牌。
I invite you to play cards with me.

69
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,206
我身上没带现金。
I don't have cash on me.

70
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,458
你得替我换这个。
You'd have to exchange this for me.

71
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,044
这是信用证。
It's a letter of credit.

72
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,521
20000美元?
$20,000?

73
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,899
这是可怜的本森为他的土地想要的价钱。
It's the price poor Benson wanted for his land.

74
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:43,281
你打算给本森2万美元买他的土地?
You were planning to pay Benson $20,000 for his land?

75
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,957
“如果你买沙子，你就用玻璃做墙。”
"If you buy sand, you build walls of glass."

76
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,752
孔子说，他是一个智者。
Confucius said that and he was a wise man.

77
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:00,757
他可能很聪明，但他可能不太了解土地价值。
He may have been wise, but he may not have known much about land values.

78
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,260
你可以达到这个数目，我的朋友。
You can play up to this amount, my friend.

79
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,730
一个爱管闲事的人,长官。 一个该死的爱管闲事的人。
A meddler, Sheriff. A damned meddler.

80
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,816
我知道我在说什么，为什么。
I know what I'm saying and why.

81
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,569
你应该让这样的人远离印第安溪。
You should keep people like that away from Indian Creek.

82
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:25,281
这就够了,・佩格特。 没有人告诉我该做什么。
That's enough, Piggot. Nobody tells me what to do.

83
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,657
滚出去!
Get out!

84
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,329
 - 我要喝完威士忌了。  - 去别的地方完成它。
- I'm finishing my whisky. - Go finish it somewhere else.

85
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,747
滚出去!
Get out!

86
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,166
作为你喜欢。
As you prefer.

87
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,252
你在扮演硬汉，是吗? ”
You're playing the tough guy are you? '

88
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,254
晚安,警长。
Good night, Sheriff.

89
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,219
你为什么不让他说话?
Why didn't you let him talk?

90
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,470
他喝醉了。
He was drunk.

91
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,264
在你到达之前，他正在谈论一个葬礼。
Before you arrived, he was talking about a funeral.

92
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:54,227
每个人都知道金矿勘探者已经被埋葬。
Everyone knows the gold prospectors have been buried.

93
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,647
他说的是另一个葬礼，
He was talking about a different funeral,

94
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,734
辛普森和他的手下杀死了勘探者。
the one of Simpson and his men, who killed the prospectors.

95
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,121
考虑到所有的事情，这不算太糟。
All things considered, that didn't go too badly.

96
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:17,083
 - 最后一个忙吗?  - 为什么不呢?
- One last hand? - Why not?

97
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,836
你洗牌。
You shuffle.

98
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,122
一千。
A thousand.

99
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,303
另一个千。
Another thousand.

100
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,237
五千。
Five thousand.

101
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,995
我只有四千。
I only have four thousand.

102
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,457
你最多可以花2万美元。
You can play up to $20,000.

103
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,960
我一千短。
I'm a thousand short.

104
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,759
一个国王。
A king.

105
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,054
和一百一十。
And a ten.

106
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,890
轮到你。
Your turn.

107
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,517
一千。
A thousand.

108
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,521
一千。
A thousand.

109
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:07,109
+一万。
Plus ten thousand.

110
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:11,030
不。 我欠你两千。
No. I owe you two thousand.

111
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,869
把这个兑换掉，然后把余款送到我的酒店。
Exchange this and send the balance to my hotel.

112
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:27,922
孔子说，给你送米和花的人就是你的朋友。
Confucius says that he who brings you rice and flowers is your friend.

113
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:32,009
有些人种植水稻是为了收获更多。
Some people plant rice to harvest more.

114
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,428
孔子不这样说。
Confucius doesn't say this.

115
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:36,555
Sartana。
Sartana does.

116
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,782
漂亮的照片。
Nice shot.

117
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:44,832
你可能擅长欺骗，但你是一个无用的杀人犯。
You may be good at cheating, but you're a useless murderer.

118
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,876
这是怎么呢
What's going on?

119
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,464
这家伙明天早上就要走了。
This guy will be leaving in the morning.

120
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:55,468
他点燃了一些烟火，向印第安河告别。
He's bidden farewell to Indian Creek by setting off a few fireworks.

121
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,595
你决定离开了吗?
Have you decided to leave?

122
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,430
我替他做了决定。
I made the decision for him.

123
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,477
他欠你钱吗?
Does he owe you money, by any chance?

124
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,645
2000美元。
$2,000.

125
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,190
对你这样的人来说，这不算多。
That's not much, for someone like you.

126
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,858
可能更糟。
It could have been worse.

127
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:17,239
你是说这是假的吗?
Do you mean to say this is a fake?

128
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,617
无耻的假的。
Brazenly fake.

129
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,120
此外，很明显他是个骗子。
Besides, it's obvious he's a crook.

130
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:29,960
你说他打算买下本森的土地?
You said he was planning to buy Benson's lands?

131
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,004
他就是这么跟我说的。
That's what he told me.

132
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,964
他当然是在撒谎。
He was lying, of course.

133
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:41,347
事实上，本森从未拥有那块土地。
The fact is that Benson never owned that land.

134
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,183
它属于他的一个侄女。
It belongs to one of his nieces.

135
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:49,146
一个相当漂亮的女孩，至少在可怜的本森看来是这样。
A rather pretty girl, at least according to poor old Benson.

136
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,941
顺便说一下，她今天应该从威奇托回来。
By the way, she should be coming in from Wichita today.

137
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,654
嘿，还有多久才会有马车来?
Hey, how long till the stage coach arrives?

138
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,241
它应该马上就到。
It should be here any second.

139
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:04,829
你真的认为pigget会离开吗?
Do you really think Piggot will leave?

140
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,998
我不知道。 但是我得先跟他说再见。
I don't know. But I'll go and say goodbye to him first.

141
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,542
为什么?
Why?

142
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,919
我还没来得及和他说话。
I haven't managed to speak to him yet.

143
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,467
他昨天和你谈过，我今天也要和他谈。
He had a word with you yesterday, and I'll have a word with him today.

144
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,845
我几乎不把他做的事叫做“有话要说”。
I'd hardly call what he did "having a word".

145
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,932
嘿,你!
Hey, you!

146
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,350
这里・佩格特吗?
Is Piggot here?

147
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:27,726
在那里。
Over there.

148
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:59,800
你不是傻瓜，皮格特，但有人比你聪明。
You were no fool, Piggot, but someone was smarter than you.

149
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,578
 - 茉莉花本森?  - 是吗?
- Jasmine Benson? - Yes?

150
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,206
请允许我自我介绍一下。
Allow me to introduce myself.

151
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,750
我是霍夫曼先生，银行家。
I'm Mr. Hoffman, the banker.

152
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,837
你可能听说过我。 我是你叔叔的好朋友。
You may have heard about me. I was a close friend of your uncle's.

153
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,965
你说的“过去”是什么意思?
What do you mean, you "were"?

154
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,552
他发生了什么事?
What happened to him?

155
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,930
我请求你，先生，告诉我。
I beg you, sir, tell me.

156
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,891
 - 要我帮你打开行李吗?  - 不,谢谢。
- Shall I help you unpack? - No, thank you.

157
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,435
我需要独处。 我很抱歉。
I need to be alone. I'm sorry.

158
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,145
我明白了。
I understand.

159
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,903
如果你需要什么，尽管问。
If you need anything, just ask.

160
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,318
你介意我抽烟吗?
Do you mind if I smoke?

161
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:44,488
不管你是谁，现在就走，不然我就开始尖叫。
Whoever you are, leave right now or I'll start screaming.

162
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:46,407
那将是一个错误。
That would be a mistake.

163
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,452
在这里碰到朋友是很不寻常的。
It's unusual to come across a friend around here.

164
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:54,331
- 我不知道你是谁。 - 我是你叔叔的朋友。
- I don't know who you are. - I was a friend of your uncle's.

165
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:58,043
你也是? 你是我到这儿以来第二个说过这话的人。
You too? You're the second person to have said that since I got here.

166
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,879
在这个镇上许多人都喜欢他。
Many people were fond of him in this town.

167
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,591
考虑到他的遭遇，我对此表示怀疑。
I doubt that, considering what happened to him.

168
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:08,596
甚至朋友也可以是好是坏。 由你来选择。
Even friends can be good or bad. It's up to you to choose well.

169
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,348
我叔叔在印第安克里克没有朋友。
My uncle had no friends here in Indian Creek.

170
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:13,726
你不相信每个人是对的。
You're right to mistrust everyone.

171
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:17,813
任何地方，我都不是本地人。
Anywhere, I'm not from here.

172
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,190
我是来参加葬礼的。
I came over for the funeral.

173
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,694
- 参加我叔叔的葬礼?  - 没有。
- For my uncle's funeral? - No.

174
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,865
为他的凶手的葬礼。
For the funeral of his murderers.

175
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,908
我把他们从眼泪的谷中移开，
I removed them from this vale of tears,

176
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:32,202
我安排了他们的葬礼。
and I arranged their burial.

177
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,456
这是我的一个老习惯。
It's an old habit of mine.

178
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:41,920
 - 你报仇他吗?  - 没有。 他们是刺客。
- You avenged him? - No. They were paid assassins.

179
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:45,424
为了报复他，我需要找出是谁付的钱。
To avenge him, I need to find out who paid them.

180
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:51,388
- 你打算那样做吗? - 既然你来了，
- Is that what you plan to do? - Now that you're here,

181
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,557
- 我还有一个计划。  - 那是什么?
- I also have another plan. - What's that?

182
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,768
来帮助你。
To help you.

183
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,146
你为什么认为我需要帮助?
What makes you think I need help?

184
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:12,576
- 我给你带了些茶。 - 你真是太好了。
- I brought you some tea. - How kind of you.

185
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:28,676
- 你没和别人说话吗?  - 没有。
- Weren't you talking to someone? - No.

186
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,260
我也没有自言自语。
Nor was I talking to myself.

187
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,608
想要一个雪茄吗?
Want a cigar?

188
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,319
这可能是你的最后一次。
It could be your last.

189
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,460
不要动。 举起手来!
Don't move. Hands up!

190
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,631
- 这是一个悲惨的误会。  - 别开枪!
- It's a tragic misunderstanding. - Don't shoot!

191
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:57,134
- 我没有参与。 他们付给我。  - 是谁干的?
- I am not involved. They paid me. - Who did?

192
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,344
如果我告诉你，你会让我走吗?
If I tell you, will you let me go?

193
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,016
这是个老把戏，我的朋友。 它不工作。
That's an old trick, my friend. It doesn't work.

194
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,311
 - 我科罗拉多乔。 - 从没听说过你。
- I'm Colorado Joe. - Never heard of you.

195
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:20,438
你很快就会了解我的。
You'll soon get to know me.

196
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:28,405
你被困。 没有别的办法了。
You're trapped. There's no other way out.

197
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:12,782
亲爱的姑娘，你又轻又漂亮。
My dear girl, you're young and pretty.

198
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:15,744
相信我，印第安克里克没有什么可以给你的。
Believe me, Indian Creek has little to offer you.

199
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:21,124
相信我，这里不适合你。
Trust me, this is not the place for you.

200
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,212
你认为这些土地毫无价值?
So you think those lands are worthless?

201
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:28,715
我很惊讶你叔叔误导了你。
I'm surprised your uncle misled you.

202
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:32,761
不，他建议我把它们卖掉，直到他最后一封信。
No, he advised me to sell them, until his last letter.

203
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:37,224
 - 然后呢? - 然后他打电报叫我过来。
- And then? - Then he cabled me to come over.

204
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:40,352
我得说你很幸运。
I must say you're very lucky.

205
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:46,107
你有一把沙，但是因为它靠近我的财产，
You own a fistful of sand, but since it's adjacent to my property,

206
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,401
我已经决定向你买了。
I've decided to buy it off you.

207
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:52,614
既然你叔叔是个好朋友，
And since your uncle was such a good friend,

208
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:56,117
我准备给你一个夸张的代价，
I'm prepared to pay you an exaggerated price,

209
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:58,119
价值的三倍。
three times what it's worth.

210
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:01,957
我们说… 10000美元?
Shall we say... $10,000?

211
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,709
 - 我…… - 不，不要谢我。
- I... - No, don't thank me.

212
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:09,422
不,不。 我只是觉得他一定是疯了。
No, no. I was just thinking he must be mad.

213
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,468
- 你指的是谁? - 一个叫Sartana的男人。
- To whom do you refer? - A man called Sartana.

214
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,887
他给了我20000美元。
He offered me $20,000.

215
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,599
2万美元是一笔不小的数目。
$20,000 is quite a sum.

216
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:21,935
- 我应该料到的。 - 你认识他吗?
- I should have expected that. - Do you know him?

217
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,854
我很了解他，所以你要提防他。
I know him well enough to put you on your guard.

218
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,024
如果他想用信用证付款给你，
Should he want to pay you with a letter of credit,

219
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:31,027
在签名之前给我看一下。
show it to me before signing it.

220
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,488
我不明白你的意思。
I don't understand.

221
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,240
我已经说过了。
I've already come across it.

222
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:07,272
殡仪员,过来这里。
Undertaker, come over here.

223
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,276
葬礼要花多少钱?
How much does a funeral cost?

224
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:14,237
10美元至15美元。
Between $10 and $15.

225
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:15,822
每具尸体。
Per corpse.

226
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:21,202
我给你20美元，但一定要有很多花。
I'll give you $20, but make sure there are lots of flowers.

227
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:24,456
 - 花吗?  - 很多。 我必须坚持。
- Flowers? - Lots of them. I must insist.

228
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:27,542
你照料葬礼真是太好了。
It's good of you to take care of the burial.

229
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:32,339
但你必须向我证明这是合法的谋杀。
But you must prove to me it was a lawful killing.

230
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:35,508
的证明。 我可以吗?
The proofs in there. May I?

231
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,222
好吧。
All right.

232
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,063
告诉我，布莱克，你在印第安克里克见过这些人吗?
Tell me, Blackie, have you ever seen these men in Indian Creek?

233
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,108
 - 从来没有。 - 这是证据，警长。
- Never. - Here's the proof, Sheriff.

234
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:59,491
考虑到所有的因素，这份工作的费用远远超过了葬礼的费用。
All considered, this job covers the funeral costs by a long margin.

235
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:04,037
长兔,500美元。
Long Harely, $500.

236
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,414
弗雷德俄亥俄州,1000美元。
Fred Ohio, $1,000.

237
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,334
吉米・巴特500美元。
Jimmy Bart, $500.

238
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,378
科罗拉多乔,2000美元。
Colorado Joe, $2,000.

239
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,005
真遗憾。
What a shame.

240
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,966
太多的工作把他拖出去了。
Too much work dragging him out of there.

241
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:58,550
你总是从窗户进来吗?
Do you always come in through the window?

242
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,762
门吵了。 我得敲门。
Doors are noisy. I'd have had to knock.

243
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:13,690
从这一点来看，我不会说你是一个可怜的，毫无防备的女孩。
Judging by this, I wouldn't say you're a poor, defenseless girl.

244
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:17,819
但是我仍然很感激像你这样的人的帮助。
But I can still appreciate the help of a man like you.

245
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,865
我只是想知道你为什么要帮助我。
I just wonder why you are helping me.

246
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:24,868
我已经告诉过你。
I've already told you.

247
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,288
为了纪念一位亲爱的朋友。
In memory of a dear friend.

248
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:35,670
多么奇怪。 我认为还有另外一个原因。
How strange. I thought there was also another reason.

249
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,464
你没有错。
You're not wrong.

250
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:42,218
我这么做是为了朋友，也是为了你。
I'm doing it for a friend, but also for you.

251
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,977
是的，现在我想起来了，主要是为了你。
Yes, now that I think of it, mainly for you.

252
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,127
我今晚的收入记录。
I've recorded tonight's proceeds.

253
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:17,879
你想查一下吗?
Would you like to check?

254
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,756
今晚生意好吗?
Did business go well tonight?

255
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,807
如果你来取结余，
If you're here to collect your balance,

256
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:33,478
你最好把你欠我的2000美元还给我。
you'd be better off handing over the $2,000 you owe me.

257
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:37,524
银行不以伪造的信用证付款。
Banks don't cash in fake letters of credit.

258
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:43,279
- 孔子说过吗? - 不，银行家霍夫曼有。
- Did Confucius say that? - No, Hoffman, the banker, did.

259
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,116
我还以为你比我聪明。
I thought you were smarter than that.

260
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,538
如果他想买那些土地呢?
What if he wanted to buy those lands?

261
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,375
拒绝交换我的信用证，
By refusing to exchange my letter of credit,

262
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,710
他把自己从竞争对手那里抢了过来。
he rids himself of a competitor.

263
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:02,674
他会用一把沙子做什么呢?
And what would he do with a fistful of sand?

264
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:06,636
有些人喜欢用玻璃做墙。
Some people enjoy building walls of glass.

265
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,723
这是您2000美元。
Here are your $2,000.

266
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,226
请交出我的信用证。
Please hand over my letter of credit.

267
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:16,980
它很可能是假的，但还是要退还。
It may well be a fake, but return it all the same.

268
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:52,348
你昨天甩掉的三个。
The three you got rid of yesterday.

269
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,740
那次葬礼上应该有鲜花。
There should have been flowers at that funeral.

270
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,701
没有一个。
And there wasn't a single one.

271
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,732
出来! 开枪! 开枪!
Come out! Shoot! Shoot!

272
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:35,910
该死的!
Damn it!

273
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,497
我不能打他!
I can't hit him!

274
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,179
黑人!
Blackie!

275
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:40,433
你也会得到你的葬礼，但这是一个真正的葬礼。
You'll get your funeral too, but a real one.

276
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,701
 - 对不起,女士。  - 这是什么?
- Excuse me, ma'am. - What is it?

277
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:00,787
布莱克正在仓库里等着。
Blackie is waiting in the storehouse.

278
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,538
在仓库吗?
In the storehouse?

279
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:08,044
他看见我。 明白了吗? 他认出了我。
He saw me. Get it? He recognized me.

280
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:10,546
我不会呆在印度小溪里。
I'm not staying in Indian Creek.

281
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:13,925
你想让我做什么? 把你的警徽还给治安官?
What do you want me to do? Return your badge to the sheriff?

282
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:17,637
钱。 我需要钱尽可能地远离这里。
Money. I need money to get as far from here as possible.

283
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:22,099
不，布莱克，唯一能救你的办法就是先杀了萨塔娜。
No, Blackie, the only way to save your skin is to kill Sartana first.

284
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:24,560
然后你就可以拿到钱了。
Then you'll get your money.

285
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:28,981
很多钱。 冒这么大的风险是值得的。
Lots of money. So much money it will be worth the risk.

286
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:30,858
黑人吗?
Blackie?

287
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:34,028
你不知道他是我的代理人吗?
Don't you know he's my deputy?

288
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:37,615
没有人看见他。 我为什么要相信你?
No one else saw him. Why should I believe you?

289
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,867
不相信我,那么。
Don't believe me, then.

290
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:43,371
但是当你选择你的下一任副手时要更加小心。
But be more careful when you choose your next deputy.

291
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,625
伙计，给我来点戏剧。
Hey, barman, bring me a Drambuie.

292
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:38,301
 - 威士忌不是更好吗?  - 不,Drambuie。
- Wouldn't a whisky be better? - No, a Drambuie.

293
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:04,410
真的很恶心。
It's really disgusting.

294
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:22,887
你有火柴吗?
Do you have a match?

295
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:20,236
"耶和华是应当称颂的，因为他不使我们成为他们的毒牙，
"Blessed be the Lord, who didn't leave us prey to their fangs,

296
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:22,863
“但希望我们的生命被拯救。”
"but wanted our lives to be saved."

297
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:31,872
诗篇124。 感谢上帝。
Psalm 124. Words of gratitude to God.

298
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:35,084
你也应该背诵它，布莱尼，因为你还活着。
You should recite it too, Blackie, because you're still alive.

299
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,838
但如果你不泄露秘密，就不要太久。
But not for long, if you don't spill the beans.

300
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,547
布莱克，告诉我你为谁工作。
Blackie, tell me who you work for.

301
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,840
去地狱。
Go to hell.

302
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,599
我给你时间考虑一下。
I'll give you time to think about it.

303
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,851
同时，我给你放点音乐。
In the meantime, I'll play you some music.

304
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:16,143
够了! 够了!
Enough! Enough!

305
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:21,941
够了! 够了! 好吧,我就说!
Enough! Enough! All right, I'll speak!

306
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:24,110
我会告诉你一切!
I'll tell you everything!

307
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:38,582
海岸是明确的。
The coast is clear.

308
00:48:57,977 --> 00:49:02,273
只有你能证明这是正当防卫，你才有权杀死他。
You had a right to kill him only if you can prove it was self-defense.

309
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:06,610
他的死违反了我的利益。 死人不说话。
His death was against my interests. Dead men don't talk.

310
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:16,620
不，我不会为这个葬礼付钱。
No, I'm not paying for this funeral.

311
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:48,903
我的寒舍，就像李子东说的。
My humble abode, as Lee Tse Tung would say.

312
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,154
谁?
Who?

313
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:54,366
一个中国男人又胖又圆，就像在模仿佛。
A Chinese man so fat and round, he's like a bad imitation of the Buddha.

314
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,577
- 进展如何?  - 好。
- How did it go? - Well.

315
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,455
你不害怕身边有这样的男人吗?
Aren't you afraid of having men like that around?

316
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:02,291
这是个危险的地方，亲爱的。
This is a dangerous place, dear.

317
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:04,543
不幸的是，这样的男人是有用的。
Unfortunately, men like that are useful.

318
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:10,424
萨尔塔纳的提议无疑很有吸引力。
Sartana's proposal is undoubtedly attractive.

319
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,595
我知道为什么，即使知道他是个骗子，你也会…
I can see why, even knowing he's a crook, you'd...

320
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,806
 - 霍夫曼先生,我…  - 没有必要解释。
- Mr. Hoffman, I... - No need to explain.

321
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,851
这是你的土地，你可以自由地做你想做的事。
It's your land and you're free to do what you want.

322
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:25,940
我不想冒险让他做邻居。
I don't want to risk having him as a neighbor.

323
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:30,319
所以我准备好了和他的条件相匹配。
So I'm prepared to match his offer.

324
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:34,406
- 20000美元吗? - 只是我的不是假的。
- $20,000? - Except that mine aren't fake.

325
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,492
 - 你很慷慨。  - 所以我们同意了。
- You're very generous. - So we're agreed.

326
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:39,328
不,对不起。 我有东西要补充。
No, sorry. I have something to add.

327
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,622
萨塔纳退出了这笔交易。
Sartana has pulled out of the deal.

328
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,207
他退出吗?
He's pulled out?

329
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:46,877
我猜他没有现金。
I suppose he didn't have the cash.

330
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:51,257
赌场老板…… 我们只是在说他……
The gambling-house owner... We were just talking about him...

331
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:54,510
 - 李谢霆锋东。 - 他也给了我一个提议。
- Lee Tse Tung. - He made me an offer as well.

332
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:55,970
40000。
40,000.

333
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,763
 - 请问?  - 40000美元。
- Excuse me? - $40,000.

334
00:50:58,264 --> 00:50:59,765
很多，你不觉得吗?
A huge amount, don't you think?

335
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,436
你是一个天才。
You're a genius.

336
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,773
关于你，你一定有一些妖魔鬼怪。
There's something about you that must bewitch men.

337
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:12,319
我给你1万美元，然后Sartana给你双倍的钱，
I offer you $10,000, then Sartana offers you double,

338
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:14,905
现在这个中国男人给你4万美元。
and now the Chinese man is offering you $40,000.

339
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:16,490
我亲爱的茉莉,
My dear Jasmine,

340
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:21,829
我必须请您成为我银行的客户。
I must humbly ask you to become a client of my bank.

341
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,501
嘿，这些骰子装好了。
Hey, these dice are loaded.

342
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:13,255
 - 不要是荒谬的。 阻止它。 - 这就是我一直失败的原因。
- Don't be absurd. Stop it. - That's why I keep losing.

343
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:15,382
 - 给我。  - 在这儿。
- Show me. - Here they are.

344
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,384
 - 你是一个骗子。 - 为什么不检查一下呢?
- You're a cheat. - Why not check them?

345
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,386
我想查查你藏起来的那些。
I want to check those you hid away.

346
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:22,348
- 我只用这双。 - 他是个骗子。
- I only used this pair. - So he's a liar.

347
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:23,724
他说你是个骗子。
He called you a liar.

348
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,584
我一直喜欢敲锣。
I've always loved striking a gong.

349
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,385
啊,这些都是我的。
Ah, these are mine.

350
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:46,515
加油！加油 回去工作了。
Come on, come on. Go back to work.

351
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:51,186
现在我们扯平了。
Now we're even.

352
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,691
只是两个酒鬼。
It was just two drunks.

353
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:57,651
你可以回到你的桌子。
You can return to your tables.

354
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:01,405
你可以回到你的桌子。 轮盘赌游戏将继续。
You can return to your tables. The roulette game will resume.

355
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,574
把你的赌注,先生们。
Place your bets, gentlemen.

356
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:06,952
信不信由你，我的骰子没上。
Believe it or not, my dice aren't loaded.

357
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,871
我的卡片标记。
My cards are marked.

358
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,831
但我没有利用它们来作弊。
But I didn't use them to cheat.

359
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,083
我踢了一场干净的比赛。
I played a clean game.

360
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:15,961
- 把卡片翻过来。  - 卡吗?
- Just turn over the card. - What card?

361
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:18,839
解释就在下面。
The explanation is under there.

362
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:37,065
起来!
Get up!

363
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:46,033
我显然欠你一条命。
I obviously owe you my life.

364
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,161
孔子对此有什么看法吗?
Does Confucius say anything about that?

365
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,288
智者说,
The wise man says,

366
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:55,918
“把老鼠从老虎爪下救出来的猫饿了。”
"The cat who saved the mouse from the tiger's claws was hungry."

367
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:59,421
 - 老虎也饿了。  - 正确的。
- The tiger was hungry too. - Right.

368
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,845
你知道你要拿什么。
You know what you have to fetch.

369
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:14,603
现在土狼会告诉我们关于老虎的一切。
Now the hyena will tell us all about the tiger.

370
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,318
这是一只马来靴子。
This is a Malay boot.

371
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:25,155
这种鞋你只能忍受几分钟，
It's the kind of footwear you can bear for only a few minutes,

372
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:29,034
然后你的余生都会被它折磨。
then it lames you for the rest of your life.

373
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:38,210
送他走。 他对我要告诉你的东西一知半解。
Send him away. He doesn't know half the stuff I'm about to tell you.

374
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:55,102
这也许会让你吃惊，但这一切都与那块土地有关。
This may surprise you, but all this is to do with that land.

375
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:03,151
我们把胡子修剪一下好吗?
Shall we trim the mustache?

376
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:06,196
最好不要。 你的店里有太多的混乱。
Better not. There's too much mayhem in your shop.

377
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,586
你能想象我为什么要找你吗?
Can't you imagine why I called for you?

378
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:24,256
我从不凭空想象任何事情。
I never imagine anything, out of principle.

379
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,632
我应该向你道歉，先生。
I owe you an apology, sir.

380
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:28,594
我犯了一个错误，希望弥补。
I made a mistake and wish to make up for it.

381
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:31,680
我指的是李子东给我看的那张信用证。
I'm referring to that letter of credit Lee Tse Tung showed me.

382
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:34,016
- 是你的，不是吗?  - 是的。
- It was yours, wasn't it? - Yes.

383
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,936
我拒绝兑换，因为我认为它是假的。
I refused to exchange it because I thought it was fake.

384
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,813
但是我犯了一个错误。
But I made a mistake.

385
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,065
我现在愿意付你钱。
I'm willing to pay you now.

386
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:50,365
我想知道你们的情况。
I'd like to know your conditions.

387
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:51,867
我只有一个,
I only have one,

388
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,411
我给你钱的那一刻，你就离开了印度小河。
that you leave Indian Creek the moment I've paid you.

389
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,637
现在是你犯了一个错误。
Now you're the one who's made a mistake.

390
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,972
这不是同一个字母。
This isn't the same letter.

391
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:16,266
你怎么会这么想?
What makes you think that?

392
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,810
量。
The amount.

393
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:22,272
说这100000美元。
This says $100,000.

394
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:24,483
那个中国人给我看了另一封信。
The Chinese man showed me a different letter.

395
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:28,445
这就是我的意思。 这是为20000美元。
That's the one I mean. It was for $20,000.

396
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:32,240
你是说那个是合法的，这个是假的?
You mean that one was legitimate and this one's a fake?

397
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:33,992
当然不是。
Of course not.

398
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:36,912
就是这样，你看，
It's just that, you see,

399
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,790
我的银行没有那么多钱可以支配。
my bank doesn't have that amount at its disposal.

400
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:53,762
先生，这封信和那封信一样假。
Sir, this letter is as fake as the other one.

401
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:57,432
就像你知道的，那个中国男人把那个给了我，
Just so you know, the Chinese man exchanged that one for me,

402
00:57:57,516 --> 00:58:00,268
条件是我留在印第安克里克。
on condition I stayed in Indian Creek.

403
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:08,360
那样的话，我们就没有进一步的讨论了。
In that case, we have nothing further to discuss.

404
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:11,405
不，还有一件事。
No, there is one more thing.

405
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,242
但是…
But...

406
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,328
圣经会告诉你。
the Bible will tell you.

407
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:31,758
追逐黄金的人将成为黄金的牺牲品。
"Who chases gold will be its victim.

408
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:34,428
许多人都被他们对黄金的渴求所毁。
Many have been ruined by their thirst for gold."

409
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:49,818
看看这个。
Look at this.

410
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:53,530
看来圣经给了我一个警告。
It seems that the Bible has given me a warning.

411
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:58,034
那个人害怕我。
That man frightens me.

412
00:58:58,118 --> 00:59:01,621
不要假装。 他也让你们俩害怕。
Don't pretend. He frightens you both too.

413
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:05,375
我们的郡长把这种胡言乱语放到你的脑子里了吗?
Did our sheriff put such nonsense into your head?

414
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:08,253
我不害怕，但我也不疯狂。
I'm not scared, but I'm not crazy either.

415
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:11,256
如果你认为你能用钱摆脱他，那你就是疯了。
You're crazy if you think you can get rid of him with money.

416
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:13,258
他接受了吗? 回答我!
Did he accept? Answer me!

417
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:21,183
- 他的价格太高了。 - 你应该给他钱。
- His price was too high. - You should have paid him.

418
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:25,479
- 我也应该付本森钱。  - 本森不是Sartana。
- I should have paid Benson, too. - Benson wasn't Sartana.

419
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,732
他是个可怜虫。 和他打交道很容易。
He was a poor devil. Dealing with him was easy.

420
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:31,401
你用铅收买了他。 它很容易。
You paid him with lead. It was easy.

421
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:34,029
但对萨尔塔纳来说就不一样了，不，不。
But it won't be the same with Sartana, no, no.

422
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:37,491
那么多人尝试了，结果如何?
So many people tried, and what became of them?

423
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,743
雷德，科罗拉多，还有其他的……
Red, Colorado, all the rest...

424
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:42,621
是的，是的，萨尔塔娜当然让我害怕!
Yes, yes, of course Sartana frightens me!

425
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:46,833
他比我们聪明。 他是怎么发现那里有金子的?
He's smarter than us. How did he find out there was gold there?

426
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:50,170
够了! 从现在开始，我们俩都想从这整件事中脱身!
Enough! From now on, the two of us want out of this whole business!

427
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,839
我不再关心。 我们想要的!
I no longer care. We want out!

428
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:56,885
停止。 我禁止你。
Stop. I forbid you.

429
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:01,640
你不能阻止我做任何事。
You're in no position to forbid me anything.

430
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,726
死了的人太多了。
Too many people have died.

431
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:09,731
你逼我杀了布莱克。 你逼我杀了皮格特。
You forced me to kill Blackie. You forced me to kill Piggot.

432
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:13,318
和所有。 但我已经受够了杀人。
And all for nothing. But I've had enough of killing people.

433
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,444
停止它!
Stop it!

434
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:20,534
别太歇斯底里了，警长。
Don't become hysterical too, Sheriff.

435
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:27,207
我觉得你俩都够可怜的了。
I think you're both pathetic enough as it is.

436
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:31,461
你是什么没用的帮凶。
What useless accomplices you are.

437
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:33,713
我为自己选择了什么无用的帮凶。
What useless accomplices I chose for myself.

438
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:39,177
现在仔细听。
Listen carefully now.

439
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:43,056
到目前为止，Sartana还算幸运。
Up until now, Sartana has just been lucky.

440
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:46,351
而你所做的一切只是显示你的无能。
Whereas all you've done is show your incompetence.

441
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:53,608
我来告诉你怎么把那个混蛋彻底除掉。
I'll tell you how to get rid of that bastard once and for all.

442
01:00:55,777 --> 01:01:00,615
如果你这次失败了，你会后悔的。
And you'll be sorry if you fail this time.

443
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:06,121
- 你去找Piggot的兄弟。  - 佩格特的兄弟吗?
- You'll go fetch Piggot's brothers. - Piggot's brothers?

444
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:10,250
你会告诉他们萨塔娜杀了他们的兄弟。
And you'll tell them that Sartana killed their brother.

445
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,172
他们会报复他。
And they'll avenge him.

446
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:48,640
Sartana !
Sartana!

447
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:52,477
Sartana !
Sartana!

448
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,563
我们・佩格特的兄弟。
We're Piggot's brothers.

449
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:57,774
愿上帝使他的灵魂安息。
May God rest his soul.

450
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,961
 - Sartana在哪?  - 他不在这里。
- Where's Sartana? - He's not here.

451
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,504
你在浪费你的时间。
You're wasting your time.

452
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:21,214
他的房间在哪里?
Where's his room?

453
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:22,924
这是你的葬礼。
It's your funeral.

454
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:24,592
你,在这里。
You, stay here.

455
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:33,309
马!
The horses!

456
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:34,853
拉尔夫! 吉姆! 弗兰克!
Ralph! Jim! Frank!

457
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,616
他们骗了你。
They've lied to you.

458
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,243
我没杀你哥哥。
I didn't kill your brother.

459
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,307
拉尔夫! 拉尔夫!
Ralph! Ralph!

460
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:59,122
萨塔娜，你在哪儿，你这个混蛋?
Sartana, where are you, you bastard?

461
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:02,458
小心!
Careful!

462
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:05,211
冷静点，拉尔夫，否则我们就开枪了。
Calm down, Ralph, or we'll end up shooting each other.

463
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:06,546
那真是个好主意。
That's a really good idea.

464
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:22,020
替我向你弟弟问好。
Say hi to your brother for me.

465
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:28,776
但是有四具尸体。
But there are four bodies.

466
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,320
你为什么给我100美元?
Why are you giving me $100?

467
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:31,905
20美元买一个额外的棺材。
$20 for an extra coffin.

468
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:34,240
- 那将是一份礼物。  - 一个礼物吗?
- It'll be a gift. - A gift?

469
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:37,285
是的，但是不要让我看起来很糟糕。
Yes, but don't make me look bad.

470
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:39,746
把它做成一个漂亮的棺材，上面有装饰品和饰钉。
Make it a nice coffin, with adornments and studs.

471
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:42,415
 - 在红木。  - 是的。
- In red mahogany. - Yes.

472
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,334
内衬丝绸。
Lined with silk.

473
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:48,129
我正好有你需要的东西。
I have just what you need.

474
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:52,008
这对我来说不是。
It's not for me.

475
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:02,936
殡仪员说这是给霍夫曼先生的礼物。
The undertaker said it was a gift for Mr. Hoffman.

476
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:07,398
你为什么要把它带进来?
Why did you have to bring it in here?

477
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:28,002
他厌倦了为木偶买棺材。
He's tired of buying coffins for puppets.

478
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:31,130
这是他写了什么。
That's what he wrote.

479
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:36,344
但埋葬木偶人并不容易。
But it won't be as easy to bury the puppeteers.

480
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:39,138
为自己说话。 我们不再合作伙伴。
Speak for yourself. We're no longer partners.

481
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:40,682
从什么时候开始?
Since when?

482
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:42,141
从现在开始。
From now on.

483
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:46,604
我来这里是为了让你交出我的那份。
I came here so you'd hand over my share.

484
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:48,439
现在。 立即。
Right now. Immediately.

485
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:53,820
有什么事吗? 你想逃跑吗，警长?
What's up? Do you want to run away, Sheriff?

486
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,363
你为什么要这么做?
Why would you want to do that?

487
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:58,408
毕竟，莎塔娜把棺材给了我。
After all, Sartana sent the coffin to me.

488
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:04,330
是的，你说得对，但我可能会进监狱。
Yes, you're right, but I could end up inside it.

489
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:07,500
犯了这么多错误。
So many mistakes are made.

490
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:12,964
- 这不是个错误。 - 你是什么意思?
- It wouldn't really be a mistake. - What do you mean?

491
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:18,344
什么都没有,什么都没有。 你是对的。
Nothing, nothing. You're right.

492
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:21,014
最好不要冒这样的风险。
It's much better not to run such a risk.

493
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,909
你是个胆小鬼，但很有远见。
You're a coward, but a forward-thinking one.

494
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:44,370
不，我不会把武器放在保险箱里。
No, I don't keep weapons in the safe.

495
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:48,416
这是我们所有的商业账户。
Here are all our business accounts.

496
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:55,465
我把每一分钱都记下来了。我知道这次会来的。
I've noted down every last cent. I knew this time would come.

497
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:09,228
是的，就像我说的。
Yes, just as I was saying.

498
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:11,230
它迟早要发生。
It had to happen sooner or later.

499
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:15,026
茉莉花本森小姐吗?
Miss Jasmine Benson?

500
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:17,403
她离开小镇。
She left town.

501
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:19,781
你确定吗?
Are you quite sure?

502
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:21,449
我是。
I am.

503
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:25,078
她说她对这里的暴力感到厌恶，
She said she was disgusted by the violence around here,

504
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,996
于是她回到了威奇托。
so she went back to Wichita.

505
01:09:34,754 --> 01:09:37,298
好吧,我亲爱的茉莉花吗?
Well, my dear Jasmine?

506
01:09:37,382 --> 01:09:40,343
我从没想过你会这样做生意。
I never imagined you'd do business this way.

507
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:44,097
难道你不觉得我这样做是为了你的利益吗?
Can't you see I'm acting in your best interests?

508
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,057
我只能看到我是你的囚犯。
All I can see is that I'm your prisoner.

509
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:47,642
囚犯? 什么一个丑陋的词。
Prisoner? What an ugly word.

510
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:51,771
我只是让你远离那些骗子。
I'm just keeping you away from all those crooks.

511
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:55,566
签署销售清单。
Sign the bill of sale.

512
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:59,445
签了字，你就可以走了。
Sign it and you'll be free to go.

513
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:01,781
但很快。
But not a moment sooner.

514
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:06,202
你没有意识到拥有土地所带来的风险。
You don't realize the risks you're running by owning that land.

515
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:10,039
我不允许你叔叔发生的事发生在你身上。
I won't allow what happened to your uncle to happen to you.

516
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:15,002
拥有一把沙子真的有那么危险吗?
Is it really that dangerous to own a fistful of sand?

517
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:18,881
不适合你，因为你在我家很安全。
Not for you, because you're safe in my house.

518
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:20,716
相信我。
Trust me.

519
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,678
只要你愿意，你可以考虑这个决定。
You can ponder this decision for as long as you like.

520
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:32,186
如果有人想伤害你，
And if someone tries to harm you,

521
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:34,730
他们会后悔的。
they'll regret it.

522
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:58,291
你通常从窗口进来。
You usually come in from the window.

523
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:00,626
守卫大门的人更少了。
There were fewer people guarding the door.

524
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:03,337
你必须离开这里。 一分钟也不能浪费。
You must get out of here. There's not a minute to lose.

525
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:07,466
但是要小心。 在第六次射击后，你的道路才会清晰。
But be careful. Your path will only be clear after the sixth gunshot.

526
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:16,475
没什么。 他休息。
It's nothing. He's resting.

527
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:18,060
走那条路。
Go that way.

528
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:21,272
在走廊的尽头，有一扇门通向后面。
At the end of the corridor, there's a door that leads out the back.

529
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:23,691
等我提到的那一刻再出去。
Wait for the moment I mentioned before going out.

530
01:13:23,774 --> 01:13:25,151
- 你愿意和我一起去吗?  - 没有。
- Will you come with me? - No.

531
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:27,820
我必须向这所房子的主人告别。
I must bid your farewells to the master of the house.

532
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:20,581
 - 射击是谁? - 它是从房子里出来的。
- Who's shooting? - It's coming from the house.

533
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:35,471
这是怎么呢
What's going on?

534
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:15,344
 - 这是怎么回事?  - 我们去看。
- What's going on? - Let's go see.

535
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:55,259
好棒的工作，你们这些白痴!
What a fantastic job, you bunch of idiots!

536
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:57,678
我们只是听从了你的命令。
We just followed your orders.

537
01:15:57,762 --> 01:16:00,765
我从没让你当傻瓜。
I never told you to be played for fools.

538
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:11,025
他们不可能走得很远。 我要去马厩。 搜索的花园。
They can't have gone far. I'll go to the stables. Search the garden.

539
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:24,914
的老板。
Boss.

540
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:45,976
停! 不要碰你的枪。
Stop! Don't touch your gun.

541
01:16:51,065 --> 01:16:54,109
如果你打算去追某人，你就晚了一点。
If you're planning to chase someone, you're a bit late.

542
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:58,322
最重要的是你能准时到达这里。
The main thing is that you got here on time.

543
01:16:58,405 --> 01:17:01,367
他快乐。
Frisk him.

544
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:23,681
离开我们。
Leave us.

545
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:28,644
我必须和这位先生私下谈谈。
I must have a private conversation with this gentleman.

546
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:32,022
啊,还有一件事。
Ah, one more thing.

547
01:17:32,106 --> 01:17:34,733
如果你听到枪声，忽略它们。
If you hear shots, ignore them.

548
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:42,575
你能把屏幕移到一边吗?
Would you be kind enough to move that screen aside?

549
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:03,262
如你所见，我把你的礼物用得很好。
As you can see, I put your gift to good use.

550
01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:05,264
他是一个恶棍。
He was a scoundrel.

551
01:18:06,056 --> 01:18:08,475
在这一点上我们完全同意。
On this we've fully agreed.

552
01:18:08,559 --> 01:18:12,605
本森的死完全是他干的。
Benson's death was entirely his doing.

553
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:14,481
我怀疑。
I doubt that.

554
01:18:14,565 --> 01:18:16,734
你是对的。 这不是真的。
You're right. It's not true.

555
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:19,987
但这就是我在审判时要说的。
But that's what I'll say at the trial.

556
01:18:20,613 --> 01:18:25,117
就像我说的，你发现了他的罪行，
Just as I'll say that you, having discovered his crime,

557
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:28,913
决定为本森报仇，因为他是你的朋友。
decided to avenge Benson, because he was your friend.

558
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:30,247
所以我杀了警长。
So I killed the sheriff.

559
01:18:30,331 --> 01:18:35,169
不，我得说他比你跑得快，先开枪打你，
No, I'll say he was faster and shot you first,

560
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:36,587
所以我杀了他。
so I killed him.

561
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:39,673
你必须听到的东西……
The things one has to hear...

562
01:18:39,757 --> 01:18:41,675
这些事情发生。
These things happen.

563
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:46,805
看，警长杀了你，但他没把我算在内。
See, the sheriff killed you, but he hadn't reckoned with me.

564
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:49,642
毕竟，我也是本森的朋友。
After all, I was Benson's friend too.

565
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:54,188
你决定为本森报仇，我为你报仇。
You'd decided to avenge Benson and I avenged you.

566
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:58,108
- 所以我杀了他。  - 恭喜你。
- That's why I killed him. - Congratulations.

567
01:18:58,192 --> 01:19:00,444
你计划得很好。
You planned it all perfectly.

568
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:02,780
我可以吗?
May I?

569
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:07,618
当然可以。
Of course.

570
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:11,538
对于一只脚还在坟墓里的人来说，抽雪茄是不可能的。
One can't refuse a cigar to a man with one foot in the grave.

571
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:14,833
你很精明,霍夫曼。
You're very shrewd, Hoffman.

572
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:21,757
但是你认为人们会相信你吗?
But do you think you'll be believed?

573
01:19:21,882 --> 01:19:26,178
- 每个人都会相信我的。 - 如果你有时间的话。
- Everyone will believe me. - If you have time to talk.

574
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:35,229
- 那个把戏不再管用了。  - 你永远不知道。
- That trick no longer works. - You never know.

575
01:19:44,488 --> 01:19:46,281
你不会杀了我。
You won't shoot me.

576
01:19:46,365 --> 01:19:50,661
不用拿枪吗? 我没那么懒。
Not to have to pick up the gun? I'm not that lazy.

577
01:19:50,744 --> 01:19:53,831
不，但你也不笨。
No, but you're not stupid either.

578
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:58,002
我们就今天上午讨论的数额达成一致意见好吗?
Shall we agree on the sum we were discussing this morning?

579
01:19:58,085 --> 01:20:00,295
今天早上是一个世纪以前的事了。
This morning was a century ago.

580
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:03,799
我将给你两倍。 200000美元够吗?
I'll offer you double. Will $200,000 be enough?

581
01:20:04,842 --> 01:20:07,302
 - 恐怕不行。  - 那么,比方说……
- I'm afraid not. - Then, let's say...

582
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:13,267
不，现在我看到了。
No, now I see it.

583
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:16,562
你是个赌徒，我知道如何在游戏中生存。
You're a gambler and I know how to stay in the game.

584
01:20:17,438 --> 01:20:19,356
我准备给你一半。
I'm prepared to offer you half.

585
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,191
一半的一切。
Half of everything.

586
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:28,157
听起来你好像在虚张声势。
It sounds to me like you're bluffing.

587
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:33,912
不，我准备出示我的名片。
No, I'm prepared to show my cards.

588
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:35,497
来了,来了。
Come, come.

589
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:38,792
我和治安官达成了协议。 我们是同事。
I had an agreement with the sheriff. We were associates.

590
01:20:38,876 --> 01:20:42,671
- 更像是犯罪伙伴关系。  - 无论如何，我们赚了很多钱。
- A crime partnership, more like. - In any case, we made lots of money.

591
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:44,423
都写在这里。
It's all noted down in here.

592
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:49,803
你介意举起你的手臂吗?
Would you mind lifting your arm?

593
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:53,223
等一下。
Wait a second.

594
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:59,480
- 你在做什么?  - 检查账户。
- What are you doing? - Checking the accounts.

595
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:03,567
听着，除非我解释，否则你永远不会明白。
Listen, you'd never understand unless I explain.

596
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:08,363
这本书是供日常使用的。
This book is for the daily accounts.

597
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:10,449
不值得一看。
It's not worth looking at.

598
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:13,994
完整的账簿，
The full book of accounts,

599
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:16,163
所有的细节,
with all the details,

600
01:21:16,246 --> 01:21:18,874
被锁在保险箱里。
is locked in the safe.

601
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:20,709
让我给你看看。
Let me show it to you.

602
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:13,345
如何巧妙的。
How ingenious.

603
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:22,563
 - 好吗? - 我的答案还是一样。
- Well? - My answer's still the same.

604
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:25,607
除非萨塔娜在场，否则我不会和你讨论任何事情。
I won't discuss anything with you unless Sartana is present.

605
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:32,030
孔子说，被误解的智者是悲伤的智者。
Confucius says that a misunderstood wise man is a sad wise man.

606
01:22:32,573 --> 01:22:34,658
我已经跟你解释过了。
I've already explained it to you.

607
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:38,704
你不需要讨论任何事情，只要签名即可。
You don't need to discuss anything, just sign.

608
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:42,457
我给你一个好价钱。
I'm offering you a great price.

609
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:45,252
10000美元。
$10,000.

610
01:22:45,335 --> 01:22:48,922
我不需要Sartana来拒绝这样的价格。
I don't need Sartana around to refuse that kind of price.

611
01:22:50,424 --> 01:22:53,427
没有他，你的日子就不好过。
Things won't be easy for you without him.

612
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,804
中国有句谚语说，
There's a Chinese proverb that goes,

613
01:22:55,888 --> 01:22:59,224
风轻抚向它弯曲的柳，
"The wind caresses the willow that bends to it,

614
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:02,436
把能抵抗它的橡树打破"
and breaks the oak that resists it."

615
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:21,788
小心些而已。 我把下一个对准你的喉咙。
Be careful. I'll aim the next one at your throat.

616
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:26,627
 - 孔子说……  - 停止。
- Confucius says... - Stop.

617
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:29,922
孔子对此没有发言权。
Confucius has no say in this.

618
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:32,466
我会说话。
I'll do the talking.

619
01:23:33,217 --> 01:23:35,677
如果你准备用这个论点，
If you were prepared to use that argument,

620
01:23:35,761 --> 01:23:38,138
这意味着你的贪婪是无穷无尽的。
it means your greed is boundless.

621
01:23:40,307 --> 01:23:43,644
这意味着你比任何人都更值得拥有这些土地。
That means you deserve those lands more than anyone else.

622
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:50,943
现在我强迫你买它们，即使你不再需要它们。
Now I'd force you to buy them even if you no longer wanted them.

623
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:57,157
你也是一个配得上孔子的智者。
You too are a wise man worthy of Confucius.

624
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:00,160
只有一件事。
There's just one thing.

625
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:07,084
 - 这里少了一个0。 - 100000美元吗?
- A zero is missing here. - $100,000?

626
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:11,713
因为贫瘠的土地是由沙子构成的。
For unproductive lands made of nothing but sand.

627
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:32,693
你现在可以签字，你可以付钱。
You can sign now, and you can pay.

628
01:24:36,196 --> 01:24:40,033
别担心。 我将这样做。 我可以数到10万。
Don't worry. I'll do it. I can count up to 100,000.

629
01:24:51,211 --> 01:24:55,007
我马上就来。 我还有话要对他说。
I'll join you in a minute. I still have something to say to him.

630
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:56,675
不要太久。
Don't be long.

631
01:25:24,036 --> 01:25:27,706
老实说，你认为你做了一笔糟糕的交易吗?
In all honesty, do you think you've made a bad deal?

632
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:29,875
不。
No.

633
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:32,002
这让我感觉好多了。
That makes me feel better.

634
01:25:32,085 --> 01:25:35,130
即使可怜的本森也会很高兴如果他在这里。
Even poor Benson would be happy if he were here.

635
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:38,091
- 你们是好朋友吗?  - 不是。
- Were you close friends? - Not at all.

636
01:25:39,051 --> 01:25:41,845
他骗过的人要我去找他。
Someone he'd swindled asked me to seek him out.

637
01:25:42,596 --> 01:25:46,266
我不会杀了他，但我会给他一个教训。
I wouldn't have killed him, but I would have taught him a lesson.

638
01:25:47,184 --> 01:25:48,769
这是肯定的。
That's for sure.

639
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:50,562
你想说什么?
What are you trying to say?

640
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:55,150
他是个骗子。
That he was a swindler.

641
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:57,986
愿上帝帮助他的灵魂，
May God help his soul,

642
01:25:58,070 --> 01:26:02,074
他是西方历史上最伟大的骗子之一。
he was one of the greatest swindlers the West has ever known.

643
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:06,745
他的专长是卖荒地
His specialty was selling worthless land

644
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:10,624
让人们相信那里有珍贵的矿藏。
by leading people to believe there were precious mineral deposits there.

645
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:16,171
 - 你…… 你是说…… - 我什么都没说。
- Are you... Are you saying... - I'm not saying anything.

646
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:20,342
你是那个总是声称土地就是沙漠的人。
You're the one who always claimed that land was nothing but desert.

647
01:26:21,218 --> 01:26:23,637
你说得很对。
And you were quite right.

648
01:26:24,805 --> 01:26:26,098
在这里。
Here.

649
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:31,228
这是牺牲了Benson生命的黄金样本。
This is a sample of the gold that cost Benson his life.

650
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:54,292
- 我以为你是病人。 - 我只是有点懒。
- I thought you were an invalid. - I'm just a bit lazy.

651
01:27:26,324 --> 01:27:30,328
孔子说:“砍下树荫，
Confucius says, "Cut the tree that gives you shade,

652
01:27:30,412 --> 01:27:31,955
太阳会回到……
and the sun will return to..."

653
01:27:32,038 --> 01:27:34,291
孔子，在你的位置上，会屏息以待。
Confucius, in your position, would save his breath.

654
01:28:33,266 --> 01:28:36,144
休息一下。 你需要它。
Have a rest. You need it.

655
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:44,778
如果我是你，我不会那样做。
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

656
01:28:44,861 --> 01:28:46,530
为什么不呢?
Why not?

657
01:28:48,198 --> 01:28:50,867
首先，因为你并不想杀我。
Firstly, because you don't really want to kill me.

658
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:52,410
其次呢?
And secondly?

659
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:57,165
第二，因为我不会让自己被杀。
Secondly, because I won't let myself be killed.

660
01:29:12,305 --> 01:29:14,724
对不起,主人。 一个快速的词。
Excuse me, master. A quick word.

661
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:21,231
当莎塔娜和你说话时，婕思敏带着所有的钱逃走了。
While Sartana was talking to you, Jasmine fled with all the money.

662
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:42,627
你为什么笑?
Why are you laughing?

663
01:29:43,461 --> 01:29:47,465
我支付了100000美元。 我是唯一有权笑的人。
I paid $100,000. I'm the only one entitled to laugh.

664
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:47,651
 - 你想吃点什么吗?  - 是的。
- Would you like something to eat? - Yes.

665
01:30:47,734 --> 01:30:49,736
也喂我的马。
And feed my horse too.

666
01:30:49,819 --> 01:30:51,237
很好。
Very well.

667
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:05,502
Drambuie吗?
A Drambuie?

668
01:31:11,716 --> 01:31:15,970
喝一杯。 它会增加口服避孕药。
Have a drink. It'll sweeten the pill.

669
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:22,602
 - 那笔钱是我的。 - 有些是。
- That money is mine. - Some of it is.

670
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:25,188
本森答应你多少钱?
How much had Benson promised you?

671
01:31:25,271 --> 01:31:28,483
 - 一半。  - 这不是真的。
- Half. - That's not true.

672
01:31:28,566 --> 01:31:33,113
他从未给过他的妻子、姐妹和婶婶10%以上的钱。
He's never given more than 10% to his wives, sisters and aunts.

673
01:31:33,238 --> 01:31:36,116
我怀疑他会为一个侄女破例。
I doubt he'd have made an exception for a niece.

674
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:39,160
10000美元。
$10,000.

675
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:44,374
你要去哪边?
Which way are you going?

676
01:31:45,417 --> 01:31:47,544
这样的。
That way.

677
01:31:47,627 --> 01:31:50,213
好的，那我就换一种方式。
OK, then I'll go the other way.

678
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:55,760
等等!
Wait!

679
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:13,069
把它。 这是10000美元。
Take it. It's $10,000.

680
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:15,280
他们减少了一半。 它们对我有什么用?
They're cut in half. What use are they to me?

681
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:17,657
赌徒输钱快。
Gamblers lose money fast.

682
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:20,410
当我没钱的时候，我会和另一半一起来找你。
When I'm out of cash, I'll come to you with the other half.

683
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:21,369
等待我。
Wait for me.

684
01:32:51,441 --> 01:32:57,238
结束
THE END
