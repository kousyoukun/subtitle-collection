1
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,987
Hey, Simpson, look!

2
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:14,783
A gold nugget.

3
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,827
Show me!

4
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,203
Give it back to me.

5
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,758
You're a pain in the neck
and you're out of luck.

6
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,802
It's a bad deal for you, showing up.

7
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,054
It's a bad deal for you.

8
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:14,676


9
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,981
- There are corpses on that wagon.
- Corpses?

10
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,362
There's the banker.
Let's see what he says.

11
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,780
Let him through.

12
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,824
It's Benson, poor thing!

13
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:10,412
I'd like to remind you, Sheriff,
that Benson was my friend.

14
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,415
Whether he was or not,
I always hang murderers.

15
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:19,421
Sure, if you actually catch them.
We need actions, Sheriff, not words.

16
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:23,425
We've always lived in peace
in Indian Creek,

17
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,260
and we want that to continue.

18
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,012
Hoffman is right.

19
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,935
Benson, you said?

20
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,230
Yes, he came from Nebraska.

21
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:43,278
They say he was half-crazy,
but I think all gold prospectors are.

22
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,863
Not necessarily.

23
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:48,742
I hope I haven't offended you.
Are you looking for gold too?

24
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,953
Yes, except that I look for it
in other people's pockets.

25
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,380
"Don't die yet. I'll be right back."

26
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,385
Our undertaker has a sense of humor.

27
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,619
Hi, Piggot.
What are you doing around here?

28
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,832
Nice flowers. Who paid for them?

29
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:04,169
It's a luxury funeral.

30
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,547
That wreath cost $20.

31
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,925
- I asked you who paid for them!
- When someone pays me,

32
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:14,763
I count the money
and don't ask questions.

33
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,640
Who Paid you?

34
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:25,023
- Who paid for the funeral?
- I don't know. I swear I don't know.

35
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,111
Talk, you old fool!

36
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,530
I don't know anything.

37
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,262
Wait.

38
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,066
Do you have any other weapons?

39
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,028
Yes, a cannon,
but I never bring it along.

40
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,247
Place your bets, gentlemen.

41
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,793
A card?

42
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,015
- Place your bets.
- Thirteen.

43
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,392
Nineteen.

44
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:47,647
I'm having no luck
at this table tonight.

45
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,899
Tell me about it.
The house always wins.

46
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,443
I'll play a few more hands,
then quit.

47
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,036
Twenty-one. The house wins.

48
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,832
What's the point of playing
when luck's against you?

49
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:10,461
Luck isn't against you. It's this
gentleman who's manipulating it.

50
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,089
Are you accusing me of cheating?

51
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,550
Yes.

52
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,680
And I'm giving you two minutes
to return their money to them.

53
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,526
Half a minute wasted.

54
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,500
One minute left.

55
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,046
And I'm giving you just one second
to apologize.

56
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,767
Come closer.

57
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,937
Now you'll have to
deal with the boss.

58
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:21,950
Guns must be left in the cloakroom,
Piggot. Have you forgotten that?

59
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,912
I don't like people
with short memories.

60
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:29,207
But... you and I are friends.

61
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,252
We were friends.

62
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:43,554
What a strange watch.
It's not made of silver, is it?

63
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,516
It's made of lead.

64
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:50,353
I only use the silver one
for special occasions.

65
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,522
Hey!

66
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,696
Between you and me,
Piggot is a very clever cheat.

67
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,992
You must be a good player
if you figured him out.

68
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,620
I invite you to play cards with me.

69
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,206
I don't have cash on me.

70
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,458
You'd have to exchange this for me.

71
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,044
It's a letter of credit.

72
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,521
$20,000?

73
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,899
It's the price poor Benson
wanted for his land.

74
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:43,281
You were planning to pay Benson
$20,000 for his land?

75
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,957
"If you buy sand,
you build walls of glass."

76
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,752
Confucius said that
and he was a wise man.

77
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:00,757
He may have been wise, but he may not
have known much about land values.

78
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,260
You can play up to this amount,
my friend.

79
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,730
A meddler, Sheriff.
A damned meddler.

80
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,816
I know what I'm saying and why.

81
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,569
You should keep people like that
away from Indian Creek.

82
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:25,281
That's enough, Piggot.
Nobody tells me what to do.

83
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,657
Get out!

84
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,329
- I'm finishing my whisky.
- Go finish it somewhere else.

85
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,747
Get out!

86
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,166
As you prefer.

87
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,252
You're playing the tough guy
are you? '

88
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,254
Good night, Sheriff.

89
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,219
Why didn't you let him talk?

90
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,470
He was drunk.

91
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,264
Before you arrived,
he was talking about a funeral.

92
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:54,227
Everyone knows the gold prospectors
have been buried.

93
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,647
He was talking about
a different funeral,

94
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,734
the one of Simpson and his men,
who killed the prospectors.

95
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,121
All things considered,
that didn't go too badly.

96
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:17,083
- One last hand?
- Why not?

97
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,836
You shuffle.

98
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,122
A thousand.

99
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,303
Another thousand.

100
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,237
Five thousand.

101
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,995
I only have four thousand.

102
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,457
You can play up to $20,000.

103
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,960
I'm a thousand short.

104
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,759
A king.

105
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,054
And a ten.

106
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,890
Your turn.

107
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,517
A thousand.

108
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,521
A thousand.

109
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:07,109
Plus ten thousand.

110
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:11,030
No. I owe you two thousand.

111
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,869
Exchange this
and send the balance to my hotel.

112
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:27,922
Confucius says that he who brings you
rice and flowers is your friend.

113
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:32,009
Some people plant rice
to harvest more.

114
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,428
Confucius doesn't say this.

115
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:36,555
Sartana does.

116
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,782
Nice shot.

117
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:44,832
You may be good at cheating,
but you're a useless murderer.

118
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,876
What's going on?

119
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,464
This guy will be leaving
in the morning.

120
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:55,468
He's bidden farewell to Indian Creek
by setting off a few fireworks.

121
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,595
Have you decided to leave?

122
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,430
I made the decision for him.

123
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,477
Does he owe you money, by any chance?

124
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,645
$2,000.

125
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,190
That's not much,
for someone like you.

126
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,858
It could have been worse.

127
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:17,239
Do you mean to say this is a fake?

128
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,617
Brazenly fake.

129
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,120
Besides, it's obvious he's a crook.

130
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:29,960
You said he was planning to buy
Benson's lands?

131
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,004
That's what he told me.

132
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,964
He was lying, of course.

133
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:41,347
The fact is that Benson
never owned that land.

134
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,183
It belongs to one of his nieces.

135
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:49,146
A rather pretty girl, at least
according to poor old Benson.

136
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,941
By the way, she should be
coming in from Wichita today.

137
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,654
Hey, how long till
the stage coach arrives?

138
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,241
It should be here any second.

139
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:04,829
Do you really think
Piggot will leave?

140
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,998
I don't know. But I'll go
and say goodbye to him first.

141
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,542
Why?

142
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,919
I haven't managed
to speak to him yet.

143
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,467
He had a word with you yesterday,
and I'll have a word with him today.

144
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,845
I'd hardly call what he did
"having a word".

145
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,932
Hey, you!

146
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,350
Is Piggot here?

147
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:27,726
Over there.

148
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:59,800
You were no fool, Piggot,
but someone was smarter than you.

149
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,578
- Jasmine Benson?
- Yes?

150
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,206
Allow me to introduce myself.

151
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,750
I'm Mr. Hoffman, the banker.

152
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,837
You may have heard about me.
I was a close friend of your uncle's.

153
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,965
What do you mean, you "were"?

154
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,552
What happened to him?

155
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,930
I beg you, sir, tell me.

156
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,891
- Shall I help you unpack?
- No, thank you.

157
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,435
I need to be alone. I'm sorry.

158
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,145
I understand.

159
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,903
If you need anything, just ask.

160
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,318
Do you mind if I smoke?

161
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:44,488
Whoever you are, leave right now
or I'll start screaming.

162
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:46,407
That would be a mistake.

163
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,452
It's unusual to come across
a friend around here.

164
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:54,331
- I don't know who you are.
- I was a friend of your uncle's.

165
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:58,043
You too? You're the second person
to have said that since I got here.

166
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,879
Many people were fond of him
in this town.

167
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,591
I doubt that,
considering what happened to him.

168
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:08,596
Even friends can be good or bad.
It's up to you to choose well.

169
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,348
My uncle had no friends
here in Indian Creek.

170
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:13,726
You're right to mistrust everyone.

171
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:17,813
Anywhere, I'm not from here.

172
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,190
I came over for the funeral.

173
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,694
- For my uncle's funeral?
- No.

174
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,865
For the funeral of his murderers.

175
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,908
I removed them
from this vale of tears,

176
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:32,202
and I arranged their burial.

177
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,456
It's an old habit of mine.

178
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:41,920
- You avenged him?
- No. They were paid assassins.

179
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:45,424
To avenge him,
I need to find out who paid them.

180
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:51,388
- Is that what you plan to do?
- Now that you're here,

181
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,557
- I also have another plan.
- What's that?

182
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,768
To help you.

183
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,146
What makes you think I need help?

184
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:12,576
- I brought you some tea.
- How kind of you.

185
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:28,676
- Weren't you talking to someone?
- No.

186
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,260
Nor was I talking to myself.

187
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,608
Want a cigar?

188
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,319
It could be your last.

189
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,460
Don't move. Hands up!

190
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,631
- It's a tragic misunderstanding.
- Don't shoot!

191
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:57,134
- I am not involved. They paid me.
- Who did?

192
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,344
If I tell you, will you let me go?

193
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,016
That's an old trick, my friend.
It doesn't work.

194
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,311
- I'm Colorado Joe.
- Never heard of you.

195
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:20,438
You'll soon get to know me.

196
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:28,405
You're trapped.
There's no other way out.

197
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:12,782
My dear girl,
you're young and pretty.

198
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:15,744
Believe me,
Indian Creek has little to offer you.

199
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:21,124
Trust me,
this is not the place for you.

200
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,212
So you think those lands
are worthless?

201
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:28,715
I'm surprised your uncle misled you.

202
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:32,761
No, he advised me to sell them,
until his last letter.

203
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:37,224
- And then?
- Then he cabled me to come over.

204
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:40,352
I must say you're very lucky.

205
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:46,107
You own a fistful of sand, but since
it's adjacent to my property,

206
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,401
I've decided to buy it off you.

207
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:52,614
And since your uncle
was such a good friend,

208
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:56,117
I'm prepared to pay you
an exaggerated price,

209
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:58,119
three times what it's worth.

210
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:01,957
Shall we say... $10,000?

211
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,709
- I...
- No, don't thank me.

212
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:09,422
No, no.
I was just thinking he must be mad.

213
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,468
- To whom do you refer?
- A man called Sartana.

214
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,887
He offered me $20,000.

215
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,599
$20,000 is quite a sum.

216
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:21,935
- I should have expected that.
- Do you know him?

217
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,854
I know him well enough
to put you on your guard.

218
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,024
Should he want to pay you
with a letter of credit,

219
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:31,027
show it to me before signing it.

220
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,488
I don't understand.

221
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,240
I've already come across it.

222
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:07,272
Undertaker, come over here.

223
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,276
How much does a funeral cost?

224
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:14,237
Between $10 and $15.

225
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:15,822
Per corpse.

226
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:21,202
I'll give you $20, but make sure
there are lots of flowers.

227
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:24,456
- Flowers?
- Lots of them. I must insist.

228
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:27,542
It's good of you
to take care of the burial.

229
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:32,339
But you must prove to me
it was a lawful killing.

230
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:35,508
The proofs in there. May I?

231
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,222
All right.

232
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,063
Tell me, Blackie, have you ever seen
these men in Indian Creek?

233
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,108
- Never.
- Here's the proof, Sheriff.

234
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:59,491
All considered, this job covers
the funeral costs by a long margin.

235
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:04,037
Long Harely, $500.

236
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,414
Fred Ohio, $1,000.

237
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,334
Jimmy Bart, $500.

238
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,378
Colorado Joe, $2,000.

239
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,005
What a shame.

240
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,966
Too much work
dragging him out of there.

241
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:58,550
Do you always come in
through the window?

242
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,762
Doors are noisy.
I'd have had to knock.

243
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:13,690
Judging by this, I wouldn't say
you're a poor, defenseless girl.

244
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:17,819
But I can still appreciate the help
of a man like you.

245
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,865
I just wonder why you are helping me.

246
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:24,868
I've already told you.

247
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,288
In memory of a dear friend.

248
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:35,670
How strange. I thought
there was also another reason.

249
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,464
You're not wrong.

250
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:42,218
I'm doing it for a friend,
but also for you.

251
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,977
Yes, now that I think of it,
mainly for you.

252
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,127
I've recorded tonight's proceeds.

253
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:17,879
Would you like to check?

254
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,756
Did business go well tonight?

255
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,807
If you're here
to collect your balance,

256
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:33,478
you'd be better off handing over
the $2,000 you owe me.

257
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:37,524
Banks don't cash in
fake letters of credit.

258
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:43,279
- Did Confucius say that?
- No, Hoffman, the banker, did.

259
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,116
I thought you were smarter than that.

260
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,538
What if he wanted to buy those lands?

261
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,375
By refusing to exchange
my letter of credit,

262
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,710
he rids himself of a competitor.

263
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:02,674
And what would he do
with a fistful of sand?

264
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:06,636
Some people enjoy building
walls of glass.

265
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,723
Here are your $2,000.

266
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,226
Please hand over my letter of credit.

267
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:16,980
It may well be a fake,
but return it all the same.

268
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:52,348
The three you got rid of yesterday.

269
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,740
There should have been flowers
at that funeral.

270
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,701
And there wasn't a single one.

271
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,732
Come out! Shoot! Shoot!

272
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:35,910
Damn it!

273
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,497
I can't hit him!

274
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,179
Blackie!

275
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:40,433
You'll get your funeral too,
but a real one.

276
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,701
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- What is it?

277
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:00,787
Blackie is waiting in the storehouse.

278
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,538
In the storehouse?

279
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:08,044
He saw me. Get it? He recognized me.

280
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:10,546
I'm not staying in Indian Creek.

281
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:13,925
What do you want me to do?
Return your badge to the sheriff?

282
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:17,637
Money. I need money to get
as far from here as possible.

283
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:22,099
No, Blackie, the only way to save
your skin is to kill Sartana first.

284
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:24,560
Then you'll get your money.

285
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:28,981
Lots of money. So much money
it will be worth the risk.

286
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:30,858
Blackie?

287
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:34,028
Don't you know he's my deputy?

288
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:37,615
No one else saw him.
Why should I believe you?

289
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,867
Don't believe me, then.

290
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:43,371
But be more careful
when you choose your next deputy.

291
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,625
Hey, barman, bring me a Drambuie.

292
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:38,301
- Wouldn't a whisky be better?
- No, a Drambuie.

293
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:04,410
It's really disgusting.

294
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:22,887
Do you have a match?

295
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:20,236
"Blessed be the Lord, who didn't
leave us prey to their fangs,

296
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:22,863
"but wanted our lives to be saved."

297
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:31,872
Psalm 124. Words of gratitude to God.

298
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:35,084
You should recite it too, Blackie,
because you're still alive.

299
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,838
But not for long,
if you don't spill the beans.

300
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,547
Blackie, tell me who you work for.

301
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,840
Go to hell.

302
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,599
I'll give you time to think about it.

303
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,851
In the meantime,
I'll play you some music.

304
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:16,143
Enough! Enough!

305
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:21,941
Enough! Enough!
All right, I'll speak!

306
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:24,110
I'll tell you everything!

307
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:38,582
The coast is clear.

308
00:48:57,977 --> 00:49:02,273
You had a right to kill him only
if you can prove it was self-defense.

309
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:06,610
His death was against my interests.
Dead men don't talk.

310
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:16,620
No, I'm not paying for this funeral.

311
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:48,903
My humble abode,
as Lee Tse Tung would say.

312
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,154
Who?

313
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:54,366
A Chinese man so fat and round, he's
like a bad imitation of the Buddha.

314
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,577
- How did it go?
- Well.

315
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,455
Aren't you afraid
of having men like that around?

316
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:02,291
This is a dangerous place, dear.

317
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:04,543
Unfortunately,
men like that are useful.

318
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:10,424
Sartana's proposal
is undoubtedly attractive.

319
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,595
I can see why,
even knowing he's a crook, you'd...

320
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,806
- Mr. Hoffman, I...
- No need to explain.

321
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,851
It's your land
and you're free to do what you want.

322
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:25,940
I don't want to risk
having him as a neighbor.

323
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:30,319
So I'm prepared to match his offer.

324
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:34,406
- $20,000?
- Except that mine aren't fake.

325
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,492
- You're very generous.
- So we're agreed.

326
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:39,328
No, sorry. I have something to add.

327
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,622
Sartana has pulled out of the deal.

328
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,207
He's pulled out?

329
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:46,877
I suppose he didn't have the cash.

330
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:51,257
The gambling-house owner...
We were just talking about him...

331
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:54,510
- Lee Tse Tung.
- He made me an offer as well.

332
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:55,970
40,000.

333
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,763
- Excuse me?
- $40,000.

334
00:50:58,264 --> 00:50:59,765
A huge amount, don't you think?

335
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,436
You're a genius.

336
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,773
There's something about you
that must bewitch men.

337
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:12,319
I offer you $10,000,
then Sartana offers you double,

338
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:14,905
and now the Chinese man
is offering you $40,000.

339
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:16,490
My dear Jasmine,

340
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:21,829
I must humbly ask you to become
a client of my bank.

341
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,501
Hey, these dice are loaded.

342
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:13,255
- Don't be absurd. Stop it.
- That's why I keep losing.

343
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:15,382
- Show me.
- Here they are.

344
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,384
- You're a cheat.
- Why not check them?

345
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,386
I want to check those you hid away.

346
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:22,348
- I only used this pair.
- So he's a liar.

347
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:23,724
He called you a liar.

348
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,584
I've always loved striking a gong.

349
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,385
Ah, these are mine.

350
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:46,515
Come on, come on. Go back to work.

351
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:51,186
Now we're even.

352
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,691
It was just two drunks.

353
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:57,651
You can return to your tables.

354
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:01,405
You can return to your tables.
The roulette game will resume.

355
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,574
Place your bets, gentlemen.

356
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:06,952
Believe it or not,
my dice aren't loaded.

357
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,871
My cards are marked.

358
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,831
But I didn't use them to cheat.

359
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,083
I played a clean game.

360
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:15,961
- Just turn over the card.
- What card?

361
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:18,839
The explanation is under there.

362
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:37,065
Get up!

363
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:46,033
I obviously owe you my life.

364
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,161
Does Confucius
say anything about that?

365
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,288
The wise man says,

366
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:55,918
"The cat who saved the mouse
from the tiger's claws was hungry."

367
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:59,421
- The tiger was hungry too.
- Right.

368
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,845
You know what you have to fetch.

369
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:14,603
Now the hyena will tell us
all about the tiger.

370
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,318
This is a Malay boot.

371
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:25,155
It's the kind of footwear
you can bear for only a few minutes,

372
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:29,034
then it lames you
for the rest of your life.

373
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:38,210
Send him away. He doesn't know
half the stuff I'm about to tell you.

374
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:55,102
This may surprise you,
but all this is to do with that land.

375
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:03,151
Shall we trim the mustache?

376
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:06,196
Better not.
There's too much mayhem in your shop.

377
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,586
Can't you imagine
why I called for you?

378
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:24,256
I never imagine anything,
out of principle.

379
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,632
I owe you an apology, sir.

380
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:28,594
I made a mistake
and wish to make up for it.

381
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:31,680
I'm referring to that letter
of credit Lee Tse Tung showed me.

382
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:34,016
- It was yours, wasn't it?
- Yes.

383
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,936
I refused to exchange it
because I thought it was fake.

384
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,813
But I made a mistake.

385
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,065
I'm willing to pay you now.

386
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:50,365
I'd like to know your conditions.

387
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:51,867
I only have one,

388
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,411
that you leave Indian Creek
the moment I've paid you.

389
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,637
Now you're the one
who's made a mistake.

390
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,972
This isn't the same letter.

391
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:16,266
What makes you think that?

392
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,810
The amount.

393
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:22,272
This says $100,000.

394
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:24,483
The Chinese man showed me
a different letter.

395
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:28,445
That's the one I mean.
It was for $20,000.

396
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:32,240
You mean that one was legitimate
and this one's a fake?

397
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:33,992
Of course not.

398
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:36,912
It's just that, you see,

399
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,790
my bank doesn't have that amount
at its disposal.

400
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:53,762
Sir, this letter is as fake
as the other one.

401
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:57,432
Just so you know, the Chinese man
exchanged that one for me,

402
00:57:57,516 --> 00:58:00,268
on condition I stayed
in Indian Creek.

403
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:08,360
In that case,
we have nothing further to discuss.

404
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:11,405
No, there is one more thing.

405
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,242
But...

406
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,328
the Bible will tell you.

407
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:31,758
"Who chases gold will be its victim.

408
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:34,428
Many have been ruined
by their thirst for gold."

409
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:49,818
Look at this.

410
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:53,530
It seems that the Bible
has given me a warning.

411
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:58,034
That man frightens me.

412
00:58:58,118 --> 00:59:01,621
Don't pretend.
He frightens you both too.

413
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:05,375
Did our sheriff
put such nonsense into your head?

414
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:08,253
I'm not scared,
but I'm not crazy either.

415
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:11,256
You're crazy if you think you can
get rid of him with money.

416
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:13,258
Did he accept? Answer me!

417
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:21,183
- His price was too high.
- You should have paid him.

418
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:25,479
- I should have paid Benson, too.
- Benson wasn't Sartana.

419
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,732
He was a poor devil.
Dealing with him was easy.

420
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:31,401
You paid him with lead. It was easy.

421
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:34,029
But it won't be the same
with Sartana, no, no.

422
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:37,491
So many people tried,
and what became of them?

423
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,743
Red, Colorado, all the rest...

424
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:42,621
Yes, yes,
of course Sartana frightens me!

425
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:46,833
He's smarter than us. How did he
find out there was gold there?

426
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:50,170
Enough! From now on, the two of us
want out of this whole business!

427
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,839
I no longer care. We want out!

428
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:56,885
Stop. I forbid you.

429
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:01,640
You're in no position
to forbid me anything.

430
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,726
Too many people have died.

431
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:09,731
You forced me to kill Blackie.
You forced me to kill Piggot.

432
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:13,318
And all for nothing. But I've had
enough of killing people.

433
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,444
Stop it!

434
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:20,534
Don't become hysterical too, Sheriff.

435
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:27,207
I think you're both
pathetic enough as it is.

436
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:31,461
What useless accomplices you are.

437
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:33,713
What useless accomplices
I chose for myself.

438
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:39,177
Listen carefully now.

439
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:43,056
Up until now,
Sartana has just been lucky.

440
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:46,351
Whereas all you've done
is show your incompetence.

441
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:53,608
I'll tell you how to get rid of
that bastard once and for all.

442
01:00:55,777 --> 01:01:00,615
And you'll be sorry
if you fail this time.

443
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:06,121
- You'll go fetch Piggot's brothers.
- Piggot's brothers?

444
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:10,250
And you'll tell them
that Sartana killed their brother.

445
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,172
And they'll avenge him.

446
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:48,640
Sartana!

447
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:52,477
Sartana!

448
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,563
We're Piggot's brothers.

449
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:57,774
May God rest his soul.

450
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,961
- Where's Sartana?
- He's not here.

451
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,504
You're wasting your time.

452
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:21,214
Where's his room?

453
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:22,924
It's your funeral.

454
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:24,592
You, stay here.

455
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:33,309
The horses!

456
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:34,853
Ralph! Jim! Frank!

457
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,616
They've lied to you.

458
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,243
I didn't kill your brother.

459
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,307
Ralph! Ralph!

460
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:59,122
Sartana, where are you, you bastard?

461
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:02,458
Careful!

462
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:05,211
Calm down, Ralph,
or we'll end up shooting each other.

463
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:06,546
That's a really good idea.

464
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:22,020
Say hi to your brother for me.

465
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:28,776
But there are four bodies.

466
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,320
Why are you giving me $100?

467
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:31,905
$20 for an extra coffin.

468
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:34,240
- It'll be a gift.
- A gift?

469
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:37,285
Yes, but don't make me look bad.

470
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:39,746
Make it a nice coffin,
with adornments and studs.

471
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:42,415
- In red mahogany.
- Yes.

472
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,334
Lined with silk.

473
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:48,129
I have just what you need.

474
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:52,008
It's not for me.

475
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:02,936
The undertaker said
it was a gift for Mr. Hoffman.

476
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:07,398
Why did you have to bring it in here?

477
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:28,002
He's tired of buying coffins
for puppets.

478
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:31,130
That's what he wrote.

479
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:36,344
But it won't be as easy
to bury the puppeteers.

480
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:39,138
Speak for yourself.
We're no longer partners.

481
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:40,682
Since when?

482
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:42,141
From now on.

483
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:46,604
I came here
so you'd hand over my share.

484
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:48,439
Right now. Immediately.

485
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:53,820
What's up?
Do you want to run away, Sheriff?

486
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,363
Why would you want to do that?

487
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:58,408
After all,
Sartana sent the coffin to me.

488
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:04,330
Yes, you're right,
but I could end up inside it.

489
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:07,500
So many mistakes are made.

490
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:12,964
- It wouldn't really be a mistake.
- What do you mean?

491
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:18,344
Nothing, nothing. You're right.

492
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:21,014
It's much better
not to run such a risk.

493
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,909
You're a coward,
but a forward-thinking one.

494
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:44,370
No, I don't keep weapons in the safe.

495
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:48,416
Here are all our business accounts.

496
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:55,465
I've noted down every last cent.
I knew this time would come.

497
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:09,228
Yes, just as I was saying.

498
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:11,230
It had to happen sooner or later.

499
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:15,026
Miss Jasmine Benson?

500
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:17,403
She left town.

501
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:19,781
Are you quite sure?

502
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:21,449
I am.

503
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:25,078
She said she was disgusted
by the violence around here,

504
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,996
so she went back to Wichita.

505
01:09:34,754 --> 01:09:37,298
Well, my dear Jasmine?

506
01:09:37,382 --> 01:09:40,343
I never imagined
you'd do business this way.

507
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:44,097
Can't you see I'm acting
in your best interests?

508
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,057
All I can see
is that I'm your prisoner.

509
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:47,642
Prisoner? What an ugly word.

510
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:51,771
I'm just keeping you away
from all those crooks.

511
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:55,566
Sign the bill of sale.

512
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:59,445
Sign it and you'll be free to go.

513
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:01,781
But not a moment sooner.

514
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:06,202
You don't realize the risks
you're running by owning that land.

515
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:10,039
I won't allow what happened
to your uncle to happen to you.

516
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:15,002
Is it really that dangerous
to own a fistful of sand?

517
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:18,881
Not for you,
because you're safe in my house.

518
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:20,716
Trust me.

519
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,678
You can ponder this decision
for as long as you like.

520
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:32,186
And if someone tries to harm you,

521
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:34,730
they'll regret it.

522
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:58,291
You usually come in from the window.

523
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:00,626
There were fewer people
guarding the door.

524
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:03,337
You must get out of here.
There's not a minute to lose.

525
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:07,466
But be careful. Your path will only
be clear after the sixth gunshot.

526
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:16,475
It's nothing. He's resting.

527
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:18,060
Go that way.

528
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:21,272
At the end of the corridor, there's
a door that leads out the back.

529
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:23,691
Wait for the moment I mentioned
before going out.

530
01:13:23,774 --> 01:13:25,151
- Will you come with me?
- No.

531
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:27,820
I must bid your farewells
to the master of the house.

532
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:20,581
- Who's shooting?
- It's coming from the house.

533
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:35,471
What's going on?

534
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:15,344
- What's going on?
- Let's go see.

535
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:55,259
What a fantastic job,
you bunch of idiots!

536
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:57,678
We just followed your orders.

537
01:15:57,762 --> 01:16:00,765
I never told you
to be played for fools.

538
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:11,025
They can't have gone far. I'll go
to the stables. Search the garden.

539
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:24,914
Boss.

540
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:45,976
Stop! Don't touch your gun.

541
01:16:51,065 --> 01:16:54,109
If you're planning to chase someone,
you're a bit late.

542
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:58,322
The main thing
is that you got here on time.

543
01:16:58,405 --> 01:17:01,367
Frisk him.

544
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:23,681
Leave us.

545
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:28,644
I must have a private conversation
with this gentleman.

546
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:32,022
Ah, one more thing.

547
01:17:32,106 --> 01:17:34,733
If you hear shots, ignore them.

548
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:42,575
Would you be kind enough
to move that screen aside?

549
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:03,262
As you can see,
I put your gift to good use.

550
01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:05,264
He was a scoundrel.

551
01:18:06,056 --> 01:18:08,475
On this we've fully agreed.

552
01:18:08,559 --> 01:18:12,605
Benson's death
was entirely his doing.

553
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:14,481
I doubt that.

554
01:18:14,565 --> 01:18:16,734
You're right. It's not true.

555
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:19,987
But that's what I'll say
at the trial.

556
01:18:20,613 --> 01:18:25,117
Just as I'll say that you,
having discovered his crime,

557
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:28,913
decided to avenge Benson,
because he was your friend.

558
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:30,247
So I killed the sheriff.

559
01:18:30,331 --> 01:18:35,169
No, I'll say he was faster
and shot you first,

560
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:36,587
so I killed him.

561
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:39,673
The things one has to hear...

562
01:18:39,757 --> 01:18:41,675
These things happen.

563
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:46,805
See, the sheriff killed you,
but he hadn't reckoned with me.

564
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:49,642
After all, I was Benson's friend too.

565
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:54,188
You'd decided to avenge Benson
and I avenged you.

566
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:58,108
- That's why I killed him.
- Congratulations.

567
01:18:58,192 --> 01:19:00,444
You planned it all perfectly.

568
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:02,780
May I?

569
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:07,618
Of course.

570
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:11,538
One can't refuse a cigar
to a man with one foot in the grave.

571
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:14,833
You're very shrewd, Hoffman.

572
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:21,757
But do you think you'll be believed?

573
01:19:21,882 --> 01:19:26,178
- Everyone will believe me.
- If you have time to talk.

574
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:35,229
- That trick no longer works.
- You never know.

575
01:19:44,488 --> 01:19:46,281
You won't shoot me.

576
01:19:46,365 --> 01:19:50,661
Not to have to pick up the gun?
I'm not that lazy.

577
01:19:50,744 --> 01:19:53,831
No, but you're not stupid either.

578
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:58,002
Shall we agree on the sum
we were discussing this morning?

579
01:19:58,085 --> 01:20:00,295
This morning was a century ago.

580
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:03,799
I'll offer you double.
Will $200,000 be enough?

581
01:20:04,842 --> 01:20:07,302
- I'm afraid not.
- Then, let's say...

582
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:13,267
No, now I see it.

583
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:16,562
You're a gambler
and I know how to stay in the game.

584
01:20:17,438 --> 01:20:19,356
I'm prepared to offer you half.

585
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,191
Half of everything.

586
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:28,157
It sounds to me like you're bluffing.

587
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:33,912
No, I'm prepared to show my cards.

588
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:35,497
Come, come.

589
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:38,792
I had an agreement with the sheriff.
We were associates.

590
01:20:38,876 --> 01:20:42,671
- A crime partnership, more like.
- In any case, we made lots of money.

591
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:44,423
It's all noted down in here.

592
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:49,803
Would you mind lifting your arm?

593
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:53,223
Wait a second.

594
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:59,480
- What are you doing?
- Checking the accounts.

595
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:03,567
Listen, you'd never understand
unless I explain.

596
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:08,363
This book is for the daily accounts.

597
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:10,449
It's not worth looking at.

598
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:13,994
The full book of accounts,

599
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:16,163
with all the details,

600
01:21:16,246 --> 01:21:18,874
is locked in the safe.

601
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:20,709
Let me show it to you.

602
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:13,345
How ingenious.

603
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:22,563
- Well?
- My answer's still the same.

604
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:25,607
I won't discuss anything with you
unless Sartana is present.

605
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:32,030
Confucius says that a misunderstood
wise man is a sad wise man.

606
01:22:32,573 --> 01:22:34,658
I've already explained it to you.

607
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:38,704
You don't need to discuss anything,
just sign.

608
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:42,457
I'm offering you a great price.

609
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:45,252
$10,000.

610
01:22:45,335 --> 01:22:48,922
I don't need Sartana around
to refuse that kind of price.

611
01:22:50,424 --> 01:22:53,427
Things won't be easy for you
without him.

612
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,804
There's a Chinese proverb that goes,

613
01:22:55,888 --> 01:22:59,224
"The wind caresses the willow
that bends to it,

614
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:02,436
and breaks the oak that resists it."

615
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:21,788
Be careful.
I'll aim the next one at your throat.

616
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:26,627
- Confucius says...
- Stop.

617
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:29,922
Confucius has no say in this.

618
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:32,466
I'll do the talking.

619
01:23:33,217 --> 01:23:35,677
If you were prepared to use
that argument,

620
01:23:35,761 --> 01:23:38,138
it means your greed is boundless.

621
01:23:40,307 --> 01:23:43,644
That means you deserve those lands
more than anyone else.

622
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:50,943
Now I'd force you to buy them
even if you no longer wanted them.

623
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:57,157
You too are a wise man
worthy of Confucius.

624
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:00,160
There's just one thing.

625
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:07,084
- A zero is missing here.
- $100,000?

626
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:11,713
For unproductive lands
made of nothing but sand.

627
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:32,693
You can sign now, and you can pay.

628
01:24:36,196 --> 01:24:40,033
Don't worry. I'll do it.
I can count up to 100,000.

629
01:24:51,211 --> 01:24:55,007
I'll join you in a minute.
I still have something to say to him.

630
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:56,675
Don't be long.

631
01:25:24,036 --> 01:25:27,706
In all honesty,
do you think you've made a bad deal?

632
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:29,875
No.

633
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:32,002
That makes me feel better.

634
01:25:32,085 --> 01:25:35,130
Even poor Benson would be happy
if he were here.

635
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:38,091
- Were you close friends?
- Not at all.

636
01:25:39,051 --> 01:25:41,845
Someone he'd swindled
asked me to seek him out.

637
01:25:42,596 --> 01:25:46,266
I wouldn't have killed him,
but I would have taught him a lesson.

638
01:25:47,184 --> 01:25:48,769
That's for sure.

639
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:50,562
What are you trying to say?

640
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:55,150
That he was a swindler.

641
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:57,986
May God help his soul,

642
01:25:58,070 --> 01:26:02,074
he was one of the greatest swindlers
the West has ever known.

643
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:06,745
His specialty
was selling worthless land

644
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:10,624
by leading people to believe there
were precious mineral deposits there.

645
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:16,171
- Are you... Are you saying...
- I'm not saying anything.

646
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:20,342
You're the one who always claimed
that land was nothing but desert.

647
01:26:21,218 --> 01:26:23,637
And you were quite right.

648
01:26:24,805 --> 01:26:26,098
Here.

649
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:31,228
This is a sample of the gold
that cost Benson his life.

650
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:54,292
- I thought you were an invalid.
- I'm just a bit lazy.

651
01:27:26,324 --> 01:27:30,328
Confucius says,
"Cut the tree that gives you shade,

652
01:27:30,412 --> 01:27:31,955
and the sun will return to... "

653
01:27:32,038 --> 01:27:34,291
Confucius, in your position,
would save his breath.

654
01:28:33,266 --> 01:28:36,144
Have a rest. You need it.

655
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:44,778
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

656
01:28:44,861 --> 01:28:46,530
Why not?

657
01:28:48,198 --> 01:28:50,867
Firstly, because you don't
really want to kill me.

658
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:52,410
And secondly?

659
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:57,165
Secondly,
because I won't let myself be killed.

660
01:29:12,305 --> 01:29:14,724
Excuse me, master. A quick word.

661
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:21,231
While Sartana was talking to you,
Jasmine fled with all the money.

662
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:42,627
Why are you laughing?

663
01:29:43,461 --> 01:29:47,465
I paid $100,000.
I'm the only one entitled to laugh.

664
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:47,651
- Would you like something to eat?
- Yes.

665
01:30:47,734 --> 01:30:49,736
And feed my horse too.

666
01:30:49,819 --> 01:30:51,237
Very well.

667
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:05,502
A Drambuie?

668
01:31:11,716 --> 01:31:15,970
Have a drink. It'll sweeten the pill.

669
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:22,602
- That money is mine.
- Some of it is.

670
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:25,188
How much had Benson promised you?

671
01:31:25,271 --> 01:31:28,483
- Half.
- That's not true.

672
01:31:28,566 --> 01:31:33,113
He's never given more than 10%
to his wives, sisters and aunts.

673
01:31:33,238 --> 01:31:36,116
I doubt he'd have made an exception
for a niece.

674
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:39,160
$10,000.

675
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:44,374
Which way are you going?

676
01:31:45,417 --> 01:31:47,544
That way.

677
01:31:47,627 --> 01:31:50,213
OK, then I'll go the other way.

678
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:55,760
Wait!

679
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:13,069
Take it. It's $10,000.

680
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:15,280
They're cut in half.
What use are they to me?

681
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:17,657
Gamblers lose money fast.

682
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:20,410
When I'm out of cash,
I'll come to you with the other half.

683
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:21,369
Wait for me.

684
01:32:51,441 --> 01:32:57,238
THE END
