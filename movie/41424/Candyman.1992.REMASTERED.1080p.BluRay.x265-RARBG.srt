1
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,734
(Buzzing)

2
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:37,030
(Candyman) 'They will say
that l have shed innocent blood.

3
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,953
'What's blood for,
if not for shedding?

4
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,791
'With my hook for a hand,

5
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:52,171
'l'll split you from your groin
to your gullet.'

6
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,721
(Woman screaming)

7
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:16,486
(Candyman) 'l came for you.'

8
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:27,289
(Girl) lt's the scariest story
l have ever heard, and it's totally true.

9
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,210
Lt happened a few years ago,
near Moses Lake, in Indiana.

10
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,046
Clara was babysitting
for the Johnsons,

11
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:37,466
and Billy pulls up on his motorcycle.

12
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,384
Now, she wasn't even
going out with Billy.

13
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,179
She was actually going out with Michael
for about six months,

14
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,682
but she always kind of
had the hots for Billy

15
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,851
cos he was, like, a bad boy.

16
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,771
And Michael was just so nice.

17
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:55,192
So, anyway, she decides
that tonight's the night

18
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,028
that she's gonna give Billy
what she never gave to Michael.

19
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,197
Have you ever heard of Candyman?

20
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,365
No.

21
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,285
Well, his right hand is sawn off

22
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,288
and he has a hook jammed
in the bloody stump.

23
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,833
And if you look in the mirror,

24
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,711
and you say his name five times,

25
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,924
he'll appear behind you
breathing down your neck.

26
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,134
You wanna try it?

27
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,139
(Girl) So Billy began.

28
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,809
He looked in the mirror and he said...

29
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,686
Candyman.

30
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,022
Candyman.

31
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,734
Candyman.

32
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,444
(Low rumbling)

33
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,446
Candyman.

34
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,204
No one ever got past four.

35
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,333
Not here.

36
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,586
Go downstairs.

37
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,088
l have a surprise for you.

38
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,969
(Chuckles)

39
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:07,931
(Girl) She looked in the mirror,

40
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,684
and l don't know why,

41
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,020
but she said his name the last time.

42
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,063
Candyman.

43
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,606
(Girl) She turned out the lights...

44
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,568
(Clara screaming)

45
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,739
What he saw turned his hair white
from shock.

46
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,325
Killed her,

47
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:30,662
split her open with his hook,
and then killed the baby, too.

48
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,498
And Billy got away,

49
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:36,626
but soon after he went crazy.

50
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,298
My, er... my roommate's boyfriend
knows him.

51
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,973
So, when did you first hear this story?

52
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:53,143
My friend heard it on the radio.
lt's true. Sick, huh?

53
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,355
The babysitter just roasted the kid,
like it was a turkey or something.

54
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,858
So, what's the deal?

55
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,819
You guys doing a page on serial killers
or something?

56
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:06,782
- Something like that.
- Well, that's it. We're done.

57
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,909
- Alright.
- Thanks.

58
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,452
No problem.

59
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,037
- See ya.
- See ya.

60
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,458
- See ya.
- (Both giggle)

61
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,504
Seems like they're getting younger
every day.

62
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:27,386
(Professor) Does anybody remember
the craze for the pet baby alligators?

63
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,596
(Woman) When they got too large to keep,

64
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,181
people flushed them down the toilet.

65
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,933
They live in the sewers now.

66
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,352
Some of them are 30-feet long.

67
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,937
(Professor) Where did this happen?

68
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,647
(Woman) Ln Miami.

69
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,400
They went blind and albino
from living in the dark.

70
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,776
(Students laughing)

71
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,738
(Man) Sir, it wasn't Miami,
it was New York. l read it in the paper.

72
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:50,158
- Oh, well, then it must be true.
- (All laughing)

73
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:55,497
Why would Danny and Diane both
be suffering from the same delusion,

74
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,333
in two cities, over 1 ,000 miles apart?

75
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,753
Let's face it, folks.

76
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,090
There are no alligators in the sewers.

77
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:09,928
No, it's round the campfire,
it's bedtime stories.

78
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:15,392
See, these stories
are modern, oral folklore.

79
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,355
They are the unselfconscious
reflection of the fears of urban society.

80
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,149
(Bell ringing)

81
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,359
That's lunch.

82
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:44,588
The primordial reptile is then transformed
into this monster, right?

83
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,506
Why?

84
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,385
Ouch! That's bad...

85
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,555
- Ah, the dashing professor.
- The lovely wife.

86
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,765
Hello.

87
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,727
Helen, you know everybody?
The crème de la crème. Harold.

88
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,688
- Hi.
- Diane, Daniel, Stacey.

89
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,690
- Hi.
- Hello.

90
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,526
So, keep up the good work.

91
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,820
- Thank you for the contributions.
- Thanks. Bye.

92
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,989
- Awesome lecture.
- See you.

93
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:12,908
Bye.

94
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,830
See ya.

95
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,254
So you wanna tell me about this girl?

96
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,089
What's her name? Stacey.

97
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,884
She could barely look me
in the eyes, Trevor,

98
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,260
and l swear she was blushing.

99
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,556
Well, l guess that's because
she's madly in love with me.

100
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,476
You know, all those bursting
adolescent hormones.

101
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,439
- You don't really think...
- No, of course not.

102
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,442
Good. l should hope not.

103
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,611
So, what's the matter?

104
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,405
Trevor,

105
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:56,117
you promised you wouldn't do the
urban legends lecture until next semester.

106
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:59,079
You knew that Bernadette and l
were gathering data from the freshmen,

107
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,248
so why did you have to ruin it?

108
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,208
Honey, you're my wife
and l love you dearly,

109
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,085
but you can't expect me
to hold up their education

110
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,921
while the two of you complete your thesis.
l mean, be realistic.

111
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,756
l have a curriculum l have to follow here.

112
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,300
- Yes, l know.
- Well?

113
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,594
So don't be mad at me.

114
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,351
(Girl on tape) 'lf you look in the mirror
and say his name five times,

115
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,813
'he'll appear behind you
breathing down your neck.'

116
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,816
(Keys clattering)

117
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:38,410
- Can l clean the room?
- Oh, sure. Don't mind me.

118
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:42,122
(Girl on tape) 'So Billy began.
He looked in the mirror and he said,

119
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,917
"'Candyman, Candyman, Candyman..."'

120
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,046
Candyman, huh?

121
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,757
Yes, have you heard of him?

122
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,551
Mmm-hmm.
You doing a study on him?

123
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,763
Yes, l am.
What have you heard?

124
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,267
Everybody's scared of him
once it get dark.

125
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:05,812
He live over at Cabrini.
My friend told me about him.

126
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,355
Cabrini-Green?

127
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:08,940
Yeah, in the projects.

128
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,276
l live on the South Side,
so l don't know too much about it,

129
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:15,322
but my friend, she know all about it.
Her cousin live at Cabrini.

130
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,907
They say he killed a lady.

131
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,242
Can l talk to your friend?

132
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,910
Sure.

133
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,752
- Kitty?
- Yeah? What do you want?

134
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,421
Lady down here wanna talk to you.

135
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:32,922
Alright.

136
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,884
She comin'.

137
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,474
l'm Helen Lyle.

138
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,684
Pleased to meet you.
Henrietta Mosely.

139
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,479
- And this is Kitty Culver.
- Hello.

140
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,731
Tell her what you told me
about the Candyman.

141
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,278
All l know was there was some lady in a tub,
and she heard a noise.

142
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,946
Do you remember her name?

143
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,574
l think her name was Ruthie Jean.

144
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,951
And she heard this banging
and smashing,

145
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,162
like somebody was trying
to make a hole in the wall.

146
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:08,958
So Ruthie called 91 1 and she said,
"There's somebody comin' through the walls."

147
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,002
And they didn't believe her.

148
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,380
- They thought the lady was crazy, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

149
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:17,175
So she called 91 1 again,
and they still didn't believe her.

150
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,388
And when they finally got there,
she was dead.

151
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,514
Was she shot?

152
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,892
No. Erm...

153
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:29,020
She was killed with a hook.
(Mimics slicing)

154
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,647
Yeah.

155
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,399
(Henrietta) lt's true.

156
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,609
Yeah, it is.
l read it in the papers.

157
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,028
Candyman killed her.

158
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,866
Yeah, but l don't know nothing
about that.

159
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,011
(Bernadette) Helen, this is sick.

160
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,805
This isn't one of your fairytales.
A woman got killed here.

161
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,474
Jesus.

162
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,809
That's not the half of it.

163
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,689
Now, that's Cabrini-Green,
not that you'd recognize it today.

164
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,692
Yeah, no kidding.
l won't even drive past there.

165
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,737
- Heard a kid got shot there the other day.
- Every day.

166
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,072
OK, now look carefully
at this picture.

167
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,825
And then this one.

168
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,959
You spot it?

169
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,796
No.

170
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,339
That's not Cabrini-Green.

171
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,675
That's this building, Lincoln Village.

172
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,513
My apartment was built
as a housing project.

173
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,015
- No.
- Yeah.

174
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,768
Now take a look at this.

175
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,530
Once it was finished,
the city soon realized

176
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,574
that there was no barrier
between here and the Gold Coast.

177
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,161
Unlike over there, where you got the highway
and the "L" train to keep the ghetto cut off.

178
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,705
Exactly. So they made
some minor alterations.

179
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,000
They covered the cinder block in plaster

180
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,127
and they sold the lot off as condos.

181
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,088
How much did you pay for this place?

182
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,298
- Don't ask.
- (Laughs)

183
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,178
Now wait till you see this.

184
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,682
Here's the proof.

185
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:20,733
The killer, or killers,
they don't know which,

186
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,444
smashed their way
through the back of this cabinet.

187
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,321
See, there's no wall there.

188
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:28,783
lt's only a medicine chest separating us
from the other apartment.

189
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,204
Hey, hey, wait! What are you doing?
There could be somebody on the toilet.

190
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,789
No, the apartment's vacant.

191
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,667
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

192
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,919
There.

193
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,130
OK. Now take a look.

194
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,552
(Bernadette) That is amazing.

195
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,596
- (Gasps)
- What?

196
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,264
There's somebody in there.
l saw a light go on.

197
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,600
There's nobody there.

198
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,686
- Psych.
- That's not funny. That was not funny.

199
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,479
(Laughing)

200
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,399
- You didn't scare me at all.
- Yeah, right.

201
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,195
Ow.

202
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,782
You don't believe
all that nonsense anyway, do you?

203
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,160
l don't. Do you?

204
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,286
No.

205
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,665
Alright.

206
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,043
(Both) Candyman, Candyman,

207
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,837
Candyman, Candyman,

208
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,926
Candyman.

209
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,137
- Oh, you chicken!
- (Laughs)

210
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,723
You have to do it five times.
Go on. Go again.

211
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,476
- (Bernadette) l'm sorry...
- (Helen) l did it...

212
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,242
(Clock ticking)

213
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,289
(Soft thud)

214
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,832
Trevor?

215
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,466
(Screaming)

216
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,803
- Why stop? What's the matter?
- Oh, Trevor!

217
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,888
What? Who were you expecting?

218
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,975
(Sighs) What time is it?

219
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,394
lt's late, and l'm smashed.

220
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,523
Sorry l scared you.

221
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:01,060
What's with the arsenal, Bernadette?
We're only going eight blocks.

222
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,354
You're the one
who got us dressed up like cops.

223
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,233
- l just said dress conservatively.
- Yeah, we look like cops.

224
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,862
- Why are you trying to scare me?
- l'm not trying to scare you, Helen.

225
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,655
l just want you to think, OK?

226
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,782
The gangs hold this whole neighborhood
hostage.

227
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,954
OK, let's just turn around then!

228
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,999
Let's just go back,
and we can write a nice little boring thesis,

229
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,752
regurgitating all the usual crap
about urban legend.

230
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,177
We've got a real shot here, Bernadette.

231
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,597
An entire community starts attributing
the daily horrors of their lives

232
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,766
to a mythical figure.

233
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,936
Now, if Trevor and Archie were in on this,
do you think they'd chicken out?

234
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,646
Ln a second.

235
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,231
Exactly.

236
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,984
(Sighs) Alright.

237
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,560
(indistinct chattering)

238
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,941
- Yo, G, what's up?
- What's up, man?

239
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,115
- You wanna wait here for me?
- No.

240
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,492
Well, then let's go.

241
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,083
- Check them out.
- (Helen) And lock the car.

242
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,422
(Man 1 ) Hey, now. Whoo!

243
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,299
Want somethin', baby?

244
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,634
l got it for you.

245
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,762
(Man 2) Say, yo, mama.
Come over here, baby. Come on, come on.

246
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,097
(Laughs)

247
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,473
Yo, baby.

248
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,308
Which way you goin'?

249
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,060
Just going inside.

250
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,521
- Yeah?
- (Man laughing)

251
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,606
- (Man 1 ) Y'all can't come up in here.
- (Man 2) Can't come up in here.

252
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,733
- Excuse me, y'all can't come up in here.
- Who you lookin' for?

253
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,193
Just going up to see a friend of ours.

254
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,571
Sure you're not the police, huh?

255
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,823
(Man 3) Look like Five-O to me.

256
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,784
Ask Blondie where she goin'.

257
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,536
Who she goin' to see?

258
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,913
- Who you goin' to see?
- Let's take the stairs.

259
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,123
Come on.

260
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,250
Where you all goin' there?

261
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,379
(Whistling)

262
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:37,717
Heads up, people!
Five-O comin' up the back door! Police!

263
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:42,138
lt's OK. They think we're cops.
They're not going to follow us.

264
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,727
(indistinct shouting)

265
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,022
Hang on.

266
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,796
- Look at this.
- Oh, this is great.

267
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,344
(Bernadette) "Sweets to..."

268
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,389
- (Helen) "To the sweet."
- (Bernadette) "Sweets to the sweet."

269
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,100
Hurry up, Helen.

270
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,062
Let me just get the door.

271
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,899
(Barking)

272
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,612
Sorry.

273
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,322
Jesus, Helen.

274
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,244
Here it is.

275
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,829
- Don't go in there.
- Come on.

276
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,208
Come on, come on.

277
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,129
Jesus, it stinks.

278
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,599
See, l was right.
The layout is identical.

279
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,644
Which means
that the bathroom is over there.

280
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,813
- Helen...
- What's the problem?

281
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,357
A woman died in there.
Leave it.

282
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,285
lt's alright.
There's nothing to see.

283
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,959
God.

284
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,796
Wait a minute.

285
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,716
- This is where he crawled through, right?
- Yeah.

286
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,434
- Well, we found it. Let's go.
- Wait a second.

287
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,232
OK. Hang on to this.

288
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:01,777
What?

289
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,946
l'm just gonna go through,

290
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,657
- and when l get back, we're out of here.
- You gotta be kidding.

291
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,743
Oh, come on.
lt's just a derelict apartment.

292
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,619
What if somebody's
packing drugs in there?

293
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,914
You're just gonna apologize
and give them your card?

294
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,499
Huh?

295
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,084
Alright. Let's listen.

296
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,176
(Helen) There's nobody in there.

297
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,345
OK.

298
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,555
But hurry up. Be careful.

299
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:43,152
- Give me the camera.
- You got five minutes.

300
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,196
OK. Five.

301
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,506
(Camera whirring)

302
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,258
Dammit!

303
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,304
(Distant slam)

304
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,813
(Sighs)

305
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,196
- Bernadette!
- (Gasps)

306
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,280
l'm sorry.

307
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:54,200
- l ran out of film. l've gotta go back.
- No way.

308
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,328
- You can't believe what...
- No way, Helen. We're out of here.

309
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,215
- (Dog barks)
- Hey, what y'all doin' in there?

310
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,759
We're just leaving.

311
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,470
- You here for the sweet?
- (Helen) No.

312
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,139
Er, we're not cops.

313
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:20,309
- We're from the university.
- Well, you don't belong here, lady.

314
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,354
You don't belong goin'
through people's apartments and things.

315
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,357
My name is Helen Lyle
and this is Bernadette Walsh.

316
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,566
We're doing a thesis,

317
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,861
and we were wondering if we could just
talk to you for a few minutes.

318
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,739
Here. This is my card.

319
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,746
- (Baby crying)
- My baby. Come on.

320
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,831
Come on. Let's go.
Come on.

321
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:51,090
You know, whites don't ever come here,
except to cause us a problem.

322
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,592
Believe me,
that's not what we want to do.

323
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,559
(Softly) Let's go.

324
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,987
So you say you're doing a study?

325
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,406
What you gonna say?

326
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,575
That we're bad?

327
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,742
Hmm?

328
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,578
We steal?

329
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,037
We gangbang?

330
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,832
We all on drugs, right?

331
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:29,044
We ain't all like them assholes
downstairs, you know?

332
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,506
l just wanna raise my child good.

333
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,050
He's a beautiful little boy.

334
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,678
He's all l got.

335
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,430
What's his name?

336
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:41,682
Anthony.

337
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,728
l'm Anne-Marie.

338
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,442
- Anne-Marie McCoy.
- Nice to meet you.

339
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,319
l'm sorry we disturbed you.

340
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,112
We'll just get out of your way.

341
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,947
lt's OK. l mean...

342
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:59,033
l don't mean to be rude. lt's...

343
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,036
You know, it's just...
The white folks that come round here

344
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,622
ain't too handshakin' with us,
you know?

345
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,790
(Baby gurgles)

346
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,917
- Hey, what you doin'?
- (Helen) Let me help you.

347
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,961
Oh.

348
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,797
Making a mess here, huh?

349
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,216
- Thank you.
- (Chuckles)

350
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,135
Thanks.

351
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,428
You got kids?

352
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,680
No, but l'd love one.

353
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,349
Hey.

354
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,143
Got my eye on this one, big time.

355
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:29,229
Yeah. They're not gonna get him.

356
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,533
You wanna know
about Ruthie Jean?

357
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,912
They all been here, you know?

358
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:49,667
Newspapers,
cops, case workers.

359
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,960
They all wanna know.

360
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,006
l heard her screaming.

361
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,177
l heard her right through the walls.

362
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,431
l dialed 91 1 .

363
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,100
Nobody came.

364
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,143
Nobody came.

365
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,729
Everybody's scared.

366
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,525
He can come right through these walls,
you know?

367
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:16,985
l'm scared.

368
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,864
Scared for my child.

369
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,119
They ain't never gonna catch him.

370
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,787
Who?

371
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,790
Candyman.

372
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,583
(Man laughing)

373
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,461
(indistinct chattering)

374
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,258
lf they asked for something, if they saw
something they liked, they didn't point.

375
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,719
They thought it was rude to point.

376
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,848
What did they do? (Grunts)

377
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,684
Spat over people.
lt's quite extraordinary.

378
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:53,105
- Be nice.
- l am being nice. l'm being very nice.

379
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,024
So how are the two most beautiful
graduate students getting along, then?

380
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,904
Trevor tells me you've been dabbling
in my favorite subject.

381
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,743
Well, l can't wait to review your data.

382
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,746
- l think l can fit you in tomorrow morning.
- We're not ready yet.

383
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:14,626
That's precisely the moment
at which l can be of greatest assistance.

384
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,714
Before you disappear down a path
to academic Bolivia.

385
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,049
- (Trevor) l think l've been there.
- (Laughing)

386
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:25,262
Actually, Purcell,
we're about to bury you.

387
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,805
- Helen...
- What?

388
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,265
(Mouthing)

389
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,643
l'm sure we're gonna have something
for you in a week or so.

390
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,688
- lt's just that we only went to Cabrini today...
- (Purcell) Ah!

391
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,691
Cabrini-Green.

392
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,651
Candyman country.

393
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,946
Well, if you're after the hook man, Helen,

394
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:46,533
you really must read the paper
l wrote about him ten years ago.

395
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,244
You do know the story, don't you?

396
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:50,954
No.

397
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,124
(Laughing pompously)

398
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,590
Then how are you going to bury me?

399
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:08,931
The legend first appeared in 1 890.

400
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,893
Candyman was the son of a slave.

401
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,897
His father had amassed
a considerable fortune

402
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:20,526
from designing a device
for the mass-producing of shoes

403
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,528
after the Civil War.

404
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,532
Candyman had been sent
to all the best schools,

405
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,951
and had grown up in polite society.

406
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:34,665
He had a prodigious talent as an artist

407
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:39,753
and was much sought after
when it came to the documenting

408
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:43,715
of one's wealth and position in society,
in a portrait.

409
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:49,054
Lt was in this latter capacity

410
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,181
that he was commissioned
by a wealthy landowner

411
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:54,059
to capture his daughter's
virginal beauty.

412
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,314
Well, of course,
they fell deeply in love,

413
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,150
and she became pregnant.

414
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,903
(Scoffs)

415
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,531
Poor Candyman.

416
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:14,454
The father executed a terrible revenge.

417
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:19,459
He paid a pack of brutal hooligans
to do the deed.

418
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:25,424
They chased Candyman
through the town to Cabrini-Green,

419
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:30,178
where they proceeded to saw off
his right hand with a rusty blade.

420
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,264
- (Sawing)
- (Man screaming)

421
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,808
And no one came to his aid.

422
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:39,479
But this was just the beginning
of his ordeal.

423
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,940
Nearby, there was an apiary.

424
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,611
Dozens of hives filled with hungry bees.

425
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,196
(Screaming continues)

426
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:51,992
They smashed the hives
and stole the honeycomb,

427
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:55,454
and smeared it over his prone,
naked body.

428
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,585
Candyman was stung to death
by the bees.

429
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,590
They burned his body on a giant pyre

430
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:10,135
and then scattered his ashes
over Cabrini-Green.

431
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,901
Hello.

432
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,948
Anne-Marie ain't in.

433
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,867
Are you sure?

434
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,995
Yeah. She said you'd be back.

435
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,043
(Barking)

436
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,672
What's your name?

437
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,132
Jake.

438
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,887
Well, listen, Jake,
maybe you can help me out.

439
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:57,432
l wanted to find out
about that woman who got killed.

440
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,226
Do you know anything about that?

441
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,729
Her name was Ruthie Jean.

442
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:04,189
l don't know nothing.

443
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,067
Did anybody else talk about it?

444
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:13,907
You know,
it's OK to talk to me, Jake...

445
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,705
cos l'm not a cop.

446
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,374
So nobody's gonna get in trouble.

447
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,878
l can't say nothing,
or Candyman'll get me.

448
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,840
Candyman, huh?

449
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,760
You scared of him?

450
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,138
l ain't scared of nobody.

451
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:39,141
But you're crazy
walking here on your own.

452
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,560
Lt ain't safe around here.

453
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,478
Yeah, l know.

454
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,525
But l don't scare too easy either, Jake.

455
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,530
You know,
you don't have to tell me.

456
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,116
You could just show me.

457
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:01,663
And if you show me where Candyman is,
l'll make you a promise.

458
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,458
it’ll be our secret.

459
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,548
Unless you're too scared.

460
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,353
Somebody building a bonfire?

461
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,773
Yeah, for the party.

462
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,250
Ln there.

463
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,503
Candyman's in there?

464
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,004
My friend Charlie says so.

465
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,215
A boy got killed there.

466
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,470
Who was he?

467
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,389
Ain't sure.
Charlie tell me he was weird.

468
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,517
He was crazy?

469
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,685
No, a retard.

470
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,396
- (Camera clicking)
- His mom was in the store.

471
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,901
And the boy, he needed to go,
you know, to the bathroom.

472
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,573
His mom was taking her time,
choosing this, looking at that.

473
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,283
So the boy started moaning.

474
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:24,162
His mom get mad at him,
sent him across the street.

475
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,707
His mom was at the checkout.
She hears her boy screaming.

476
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,543
(Boy, screaming) 'Mommy!

477
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:30,919
'Mommy!'

478
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,588
There's a big tough guy.

479
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,340
He runs over to check it out.

480
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,217
(Woman screaming)

481
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,678
(Jake) Come out of there
shaking and crying.

482
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,514
He only been in there five seconds.

483
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,935
Come out of there
and his hair turned white.

484
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,647
l mean, it turned white, just like that.

485
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,067
- Was the boy murdered?
- Worse.

486
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:58,363
He's lying on the floor in a pool of blood,
holding himself.

487
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,115
(Boy screaming)

488
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,784
'Mommy! Mommy!'

489
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:07,205
They found it floating in a toilet.

490
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,916
Can't fix that. Better off dead.

491
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,044
Did Candyman do this?

492
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,304
Listen, you wait here for me, OK?

493
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,722
OK.

494
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,146
(Camera clicking)

495
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,241
Hello?

496
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,287
(Gasps)

497
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,920
(Coughing)

498
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,943
(Coughing)

499
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,718
(Buzzing,
Helen exclaims)

500
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,514
(Coughing)

501
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,986
Candyman.

502
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,964
Oh, excuse me.

503
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,133
l'm done here.
l'll just get out of your way.

504
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,392
Listen, l don't want to interfere
with your business.

505
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,394
l'm not a cop.

506
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,230
l'm from the University of Illinois.

507
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,858
Erm...

508
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,402
l'll just get out of your way.

509
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:45,280
Hey, come on! Let me go!

510
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,240
Look, you're not being very smart.

511
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:50,243
My colleagues know where l am
and they're expecting me back.

512
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:51,661
Now let me go!

513
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,709
l hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

514
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,379
- Well, you found him.
- (Groans)

515
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:10,555
(Men laughing)

516
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,857
We hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

517
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:22,484
(Policeman) Step back.

518
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,740
Number four,
step forward and say the line.

519
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,868
We hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

520
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,578
(Policeman) Step back.

521
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,542
Number five,
step forward and say the line.

522
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,795
We hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

523
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,464
(Policeman) Step back.
Take them out.

524
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,311
He's number five.

525
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,772
Good work.

526
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,816
(Sighs)

527
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,568
How'd you catch him?

528
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,445
We swept the place.

529
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,531
We start from the top floor
and work our way down.

530
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,117
That way you can flush them all out.

531
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,285
Whole of Cabrini's locked down now.

532
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,996
You're very lucky to be alive, Ms. Lyle.

533
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:23,795
- Did he kill Ruthie Jean?
- Oh, no question.

534
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,422
Killed that poor kid as well.

535
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,341
He ran the Overlords.

536
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:31,010
Oh, we knew everything about him.

537
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:35,181
Only reason why we didn't bring him in before
because we couldn't find anyone to testify.

538
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,769
We can't protect them down
at Cabrini-Green, and they knew that.

539
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,106
What about the little boy, Jake?

540
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,985
We don't need him.
We have you.

541
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,742
Hey, Jake.

542
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,252
Listen, l just wanted to thank you
for saving my life.

543
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,212
l wanna go home.

544
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,047
We'll get you out of here
right away, kid.

545
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,883
You did good.

546
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,886
You said it was our secret.
You lied.

547
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,389
Lt still is, Jake.
You won't have to go to court.

548
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,103
(Whispers) Candyman will get me.

549
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,440
Candyman isn't real.

550
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,234
He's just a story.

551
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,488
You know, like Dracula or Frankenstein.

552
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,826
A bad man took his name
so he could scare us.

553
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:39,454
But now that he's locked up,
everything's gonna be OK.

554
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,416
Candyman ain't real?

555
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,169
No.

556
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,129
(Door unlocking)

557
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:53,927
Hey, dear!

558
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,888
Whoa! Slow down!
You're supposed to be the invalid here.

559
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,432
No, no, no, it's much better.
Look. See? lt's much better today.

560
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:00,683
Yeah, it looks great.

561
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,936
Come sit down.

562
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,737
(Chuckles)

563
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:21,287
- You haven't eaten already, have you?
- No, of course not.

564
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,206
OK, good.

565
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,642
(Bernadette) Hey!

566
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,644
Welcome back.

567
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,771
- Thanks.
- Let me see.

568
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:51,818
l'm so glad you're OK.
l would've totally freaked.

569
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:54,279
Yeah, but you know
what bugs me about the whole thing?

570
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,906
Two people get brutally murdered
and the cops do nothing.

571
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:59,617
Whereas a white woman goes in there and
gets attacked, and they lock the place down.

572
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,995
(Bernadette) Yeah, l know,
but this was a bad guy.

573
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,914
You got him put away.
That's all that matters.

574
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:09,502
- Oh! l've got a surprise for you.
- What?

575
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:11,629
You're not gonna believe it.

576
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,465
The pictures!

577
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:18,094
A friend of mine in the photography
department managed to save most of them.

578
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,722
l'd written them off.
The camera was smashed.

579
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:23,683
That's not all.

580
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,476
l've been talking to some publishers,

581
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:29,230
and there's a lot of interest
since you made the local section.

582
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:30,648
We're gonna be published.

583
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,485
Alright. So l'll come over tomorrow at 9:00,
and we'll get started, right?

584
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:35,612
- Yeah.
- OK.

585
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,666
(Car horn beeps)

586
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,112
(Candyman) 'Helen.'

587
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,699
Yes?

588
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:24,202
(Candyman) 'Helen.'

589
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,960
Who is that?

590
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,216
Who is that?

591
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,095
Helen.

592
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,639
l came for you.

593
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,744
Do l know you?

594
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:07,995
No.

595
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:12,250
No, but you doubted me.

596
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,128
l'm sorry. l have to go.

597
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,797
No need to leave yet.

598
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,804
But l'm late.

599
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:28,349
You are not content with the stories,

600
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:31,102
so l was obliged to come.

601
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,482
(Sighs)

602
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:39,861
Be my victim.

603
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:46,117
Be my victim.

604
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:52,540
'l am the writing on the wall,

605
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:55,001
'the whisper in the classroom.

606
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:59,380
'Without these things,
l am nothing.

607
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:03,217
'So now,
l must shed innocent blood.

608
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,595
'Come with me.'

609
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,847
(Anne-Marie screaming)

610
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:12,226
(Anne-Marie moaning)

611
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:18,399
(Anne-Marie sobbing)

612
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,067
(Anne-Marie) No!

613
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,695
(Anne-Marie screaming)

614
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,204
(Sobbing)

615
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,919
Anthony!

616
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,087
Anthony!

617
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,468
No, no! No!

618
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,845
No! Anthony!

619
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,389
Anthony!

620
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,266
(Continues sobbing)

621
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,982
Anthony! No!

622
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,692
- Anne-Marie?
- (Shrieks)

623
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,403
You bitch! You bitch!

624
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,447
- Stay back! Stay back!
- Where's my baby?

625
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,449
Where's my baby?

626
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:09,784
My baby!

627
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,286
You murderer!

628
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,497
You... No!

629
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,834
Stop!
Please, stop! Stop.

630
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,670
(Screaming)

631
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:24,966
Now, stop! Stop!

632
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,468
Police! Open up!

633
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,554
Alright, hold it right there!

634
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,763
Back away! Now!

635

- (Screaming)
- Look out, look out!

636
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,104
(Helicopter hovering)

637
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,244
Remove your sweater.

638
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,829
(Sobbing)

639
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:03,421
Drop it and slide it over to me.

640
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:08,676
Take off your brassiere.

641
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:13,347
Can l please take a shower?

642
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,225
(Groans)

643
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,812
Oh, God.

644
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,691
Drop it, slide it over to me.

returned to her apartment.

She discovered her dog
with its head cut off.

663

She cried for assistance,

664

at which point you attacked her
with a meat cleaver.

(Attorney) Cover her face.
Don't say anything.

693

Now, they haven't charged you

(Screaming)

1002
01:30:36,222 --> 01:30:38,348
(Priest) We commend to Almighty God,
our sister, Helen,

1003
01:30:38,474 --> 01:30:40,809
and we commit her body
to the ground.

Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

1005
01:30:45,648 --> 01:30:48,900
The Lord bless her and keep her
and give her peace.

01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:51,611
God of holiness and power,

accept our prayers,
on behalf of your servant, Helen.

1008
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:56,908
Do not count her deeds against her,

1009
01:30:57,034 --> 01:31:00,287
for in her heart she desired
to do your will.

1010
01:31:00,413 --> 01:31:05,292
May Almighty God bless you,
the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

1011
01:31:14,177 --> 01:31:16,052
(Man) My God. Look at that.

Helen.

1029
01:34:31,207 --> 01:34:32,415
Helen.

1030
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:35,251
Ow.

1031
01:34:40,049 --> 01:34:41,758
What's the matter, Trevor?

1032
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:44,219
Scared of something?

1033
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:47,639
(Groaning)

1034
01:34:48,015 --> 01:34:49,349
(Gurgling)

1035
01:34:54,647 --> 01:34:56,523
Trevor?

1036
01:34:56,649 --> 01:34:58,316
My God, Trevor?

1037
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:00,902
Trevor?

1038
01:35:02,113 --> 01:35:03,738
