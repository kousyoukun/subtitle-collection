00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:18,244
(Man) 'They will say that I have shed
innocent blood.

2
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,545
'What's blood for
if not for shedding?

3
00:02:24,468 --> 00:02:27,385
'With my hook for a hand

4
00:02:27,554 --> 00:02:31,599
'l'll split you from your groin
to your gullet.

5
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:56,029
'l came for you.'

6
00:03:01,505 --> 00:03:04,874
(Woman) This is the scariest story
I've ever heard

7
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,710
and it's totally true.

8
00:03:06,927 --> 00:03:10,627
'lt happened a few years ago
near Moses lake in lndiana.

9
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:13,380
'Clara was baby-sitting
for the Johnsons

on his motorcycle.

'She wasn't even
going out with Billy.

12
00:03:19,523 --> 00:03:21,562
'She was going out with Michael
for about six months

13
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:25,061
'but she always kind of had
the hots for Billy

14
00:03:25,362 --> 00:03:27,189
'because he was like a bad boy

15
00:03:27,364 --> 00:03:30,115
'and Michael was...
he was just so nice.

16
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,072
'So anyway, she decides
that tonight's the night

17
00:03:33,203 --> 00:03:37,414
'that she's going to give Billy
what she never gave to Michael.'

18
00:03:37,707 --> 00:03:39,700
Have you ever heard of Candyman?

19
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:40,706
No.

20
00:03:40,836 --> 00:03:43,327
His right hand is sawn off.

21
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:48,381
He has a hook jammed
in the bloody stump

22
00:03:48,552 --> 00:03:51,090
and if you look in the mirror

23
00:03:51,263 --> 00:03:54,050
and you say his name five times

24
00:03:54,224 --> 00:03:58,008
he'll appear behind you,
breathing down your neck.

25
00:03:58,395 --> 00:03:59,889
You want to try it?

26
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:05,567
'So Billy began.

Candyman...

Candyman...

31
00:04:18,582 --> 00:04:20,124
Candyman...

32
00:04:26,298 --> 00:04:28,967
No one ever
got past four.

33
00:04:31,303 --> 00:04:32,845
Not here.

34
00:04:33,722 --> 00:04:37,422
Go downstairs.
I have a surprise for you.

35
00:04:45,776 --> 00:04:47,852
'She looked in the mirror

36
00:04:48,028 --> 00:04:49,937
'and I don't know why

37
00:04:50,113 --> 00:04:52,272
'but she said his name
the last time.'

38
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:54,073
Candyman.

39
00:04:54,284 --> 00:04:56,407
'She turned out the lights...'

40
00:04:56,578 --> 00:04:58,487
(Clara screaming)

41
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:02,999
...and what he saw turned
his hair white from shock.

42
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,783
Killed her.

43
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:07,748
Split her open with his hook

44
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,962
and then killed the baby too.

45
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:12,256
And Billy got away

46
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:15,386
but soon after,
he went crazy.

47
00:05:16,765 --> 00:05:20,763
My...my roommate's
boyfriend knows him.

48
00:05:26,775 --> 00:05:29,230
So when did you first hear this story?

49
00:05:29,402 --> 00:05:31,110
My friend heard it on the radio.

50
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,442
It's true. Sick, huh?

51
00:05:32,614 --> 00:05:35,615
The baby-sitter just roasted the kid
like it was a turkey or something.

52
00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:39,113
So, what's the deal?

53
00:05:39,496 --> 00:05:42,283
You guys doing a page
on serial killers?

54
00:05:42,457 --> 00:05:44,284
Something like that.

55
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:46,251
Well, that's it.
We're done.

56
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,124
- Thanks.
- No problem.

57
00:05:49,297 --> 00:05:51,504
See you.

58
00:05:51,675 --> 00:05:53,134
See you.

59
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:55,260
(lmitates young man)
See you.

60
00:05:55,429 --> 00:05:56,709
(Chuckles)

61
00:05:56,888 --> 00:05:59,759
Seems like they're getting
younger every day.

62
00:06:02,853 --> 00:06:06,685
(Man) Does anybody remember
the craze for the pet baby alligators?

63
00:06:06,815 --> 00:06:10,765
(Woman) When they got too large to keep
people flushed them down the toilet.

64
00:06:10,944 --> 00:06:14,562
They live in the sewers.
Some or them are 30 feet long.

65
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,777
- Where did this happen?
- In Miami.

66
00:06:17,951 --> 00:06:20,905
They went blind and albino
from living in the dark.

67
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,110
(Audience laughs)

68
00:06:22,247 --> 00:06:25,912
(Boy) It wasn't Miami. It was New York.
I read it in the paper.

69
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:27,960
Then it must be true.

70
00:06:28,086 --> 00:06:29,415
(Audience laughs)

71
00:06:29,546 --> 00:06:31,704
Why would Danny and Diane

72
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,841
both be suffering
from the same delusion

73
00:06:34,968 --> 00:06:37,755
in two cities
over 1 ,000 miles apart?

74
00:06:38,388 --> 00:06:40,428
Let's face it, folks.

75
00:06:41,057 --> 00:06:44,343
There are no alligators in the sewers.

76
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:49,644
No, it's...it's round the campfire.
It's bedtime stories.

77
00:06:50,066 --> 00:06:54,859
See, these stories are...
modern oral folklore.

78
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,656
They are the unselfconscious reflection
of the fears of urban society.

79
00:06:59,826 --> 00:07:01,368
(Bell ringing)

80
00:07:01,578 --> 00:07:02,989
That's lunch.

81
00:07:20,472 --> 00:07:24,517
(Man) Like the primordial reptile
it's formed into a monster. Why?

82
00:07:27,354 --> 00:07:29,097
Ouch! Oh...

83
00:07:30,107 --> 00:07:34,235
- The dashing professor.
- The lovely wife.

84
00:07:34,903 --> 00:07:36,611
Helen, you
know everybody?

85
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,358
Crème de la crème...
Harold, Diane, Danny, Stacey.

86
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:43,865
- Hi.
- Hello.

87
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:47,572
So, keep up the good work.
Thank you for your contributions.

88
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:49,243
- Thanks. Bye.
- Awesome lecture.

89
00:07:51,628 --> 00:07:52,743
Bye.

90
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:58,254
See ya.

91
00:08:03,557 --> 00:08:05,633
So, you want to tell me
about this girl?

92
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:08,217
What's her name? Stacey.

93
00:08:08,437 --> 00:08:10,643
She could barely look me
in the eyes, Trevor

94
00:08:10,814 --> 00:08:12,605
and she was blushing.

95
00:08:12,774 --> 00:08:16,642
Well, I guess it's because
she's madly in love with me.

96
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,904
All those bursting
adolescent hormones.

97
00:08:20,907 --> 00:08:24,572
- You don't really think...
- No, of course not.

98
00:08:24,745 --> 00:08:26,737
Good. I should hope not.

99
00:08:26,913 --> 00:08:30,080
So, what's the matter?

100
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:32,783
Trevor, you promised
you wouldn't do

101
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,493
the urban legends lecture
until next semester.

102
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:38,922
You knew Bernadette and I
were gathering data.

103
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:40,966
Why did you have to ruin it?

104
00:08:41,136 --> 00:08:44,671
I love you dearly
but I can't hold up their education

105
00:08:44,806 --> 00:08:47,807
while the two of you
complete your thesis.

106
00:08:47,976 --> 00:08:49,304
I have a curriculum
to follow here.

107
00:08:49,478 --> 00:08:50,758
Yes, I know.

108
00:08:50,937 --> 00:08:53,345
Well...so don't
be mad at me.

109
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,812
(Woman) 'lf you look in the mirror
and say his name five times

110
00:09:01,948 --> 00:09:04,736
'he'll appear behind you,
breathing down your neck.'

111
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:07,737
(Typing)

112
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:15,829
Can I clean your room?

113
00:09:16,004 --> 00:09:17,629
Oh, sure. Don't mind me.

114
00:09:17,798 --> 00:09:19,173
'So Billy began.

115
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,962
'He looked in the mirror

116
00:09:21,134 --> 00:09:25,262
'and he said, "Candyman,
Candyman, Candyman..."'

117
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,512
Candyman, huh?

118
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:32,226
Yes. Have you heard of him?

119
00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:36,808
- You doing a study on him?
- Yes, I am.

120
00:09:36,983 --> 00:09:38,312
What have you heard?

121
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:42,147
Everybody scared of him
once it get dark.

122
00:09:42,322 --> 00:09:45,240
He live over at Cabrini.
My friend told me about him.

123
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:46,565
Cabrini Green?

124
00:09:46,743 --> 00:09:48,024
Yeah, in the Projects.

125
00:09:48,203 --> 00:09:51,738
I live on the South Side
so I don't know much about it.

126
00:09:51,957 --> 00:09:54,993
But my friend know all about it.
Her cousin live at Cabrini.

127
00:09:55,252 --> 00:09:57,079
They say he killed a lady.

128
00:09:57,212 --> 00:09:58,706
Can I talk to your friend?

129
00:09:58,922 --> 00:10:00,202
Sure.

130
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:06,919
Kitty?

131
00:10:07,097 --> 00:10:10,929
- Yeah, what do you want?
- Lady down here want to talk to you.

132
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:12,346
All right.

133
00:10:13,979 --> 00:10:15,971
She coming.

134
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:21,767
I'm Helen Lyle.

135
00:10:21,945 --> 00:10:24,270
Pleased to meet you.
Henrietta Mosely.

136
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:26,072
And this is Kitty Culver.

137
00:10:26,241 --> 00:10:29,112
Tell her what you told me
about the Candyman.

138
00:10:29,327 --> 00:10:34,832
All I know is there was some lady in a tub,
and she heard a noise.

139
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,708
Do you remember her name?

140
00:10:36,877 --> 00:10:39,284
Her name was Ruthie Jean.

141
00:10:39,463 --> 00:10:43,591
She heard banging and smashing like
somebody was making a hole in the wall.

142
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:46,214
So Ruthie called 91 1 .

143
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:48,337
She said, "Somebody is coming
through the wall."

144
00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:50,548
And they didn't believe her.

145
00:10:50,724 --> 00:10:52,800
They thought the lady
was crazy, right?

146
00:10:52,976 --> 00:10:56,594
So she called 91 1 again
and they still didn't believe her.

147
00:10:57,606 --> 00:11:00,476
When they finally got
there, she was dead.

148
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,979
Was she shot?

149
00:11:02,944 --> 00:11:04,984
No.

150
00:11:05,155 --> 00:11:08,488
She was killed with a hook. Schhht!

151
00:11:10,494 --> 00:11:11,869
(Henrietta) It's true.

152
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:13,994
Yeah, I read it in the papers.

153
00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:17,533
(Henrietta) Candyman killed her.

154
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:18,705
(Kitty) Yeah, but...

155
00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:21,711
I don't know nothing about that.

156
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:22,351
(Bernadette) Helen, this is sick.

157
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:25,152
This isn't one of your fairy tales.
The woman got killed here.

158
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,814
That's not the half of it.

159
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,023
That's Cabrini Green
not that you'd recognise it today.

160
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:35,406
Yeah, no kidding.

161
00:12:35,537 --> 00:12:37,411
I won't even drive
past there.

162
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:41,240
- A kid got shot there the other day.
- Everyday.

163
00:12:41,418 --> 00:12:44,585
OK, now look carefully
at this picture

164
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:46,337
and then this one.

165
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:54,595
You spot it?

166
00:12:54,723 --> 00:12:56,300
No.

167
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,633
That's not Cabrini Green.

168
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,977
That's this building,
Lincoln village.

169
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:05,598
My apartment was built
as a housing project.

170
00:13:05,817 --> 00:13:07,062
No.

171
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:08,315
Yeah.

172
00:13:08,528 --> 00:13:10,687
Now take a look at this.

173
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:23,454
Once finished the city realised
there was no barrier

174
00:13:23,627 --> 00:13:25,536
between here and the Gold Coast.

175
00:13:25,712 --> 00:13:27,919
Unlike over there
where the highway

176
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:30,580
and the el train
keep the ghetto cut off.

177
00:13:30,717 --> 00:13:32,840
So they made some
minor alterations.

178
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:35,549
They covered the cinder block
in plaster

179
00:13:35,722 --> 00:13:37,382
and sold the lot off
as condos.

180
00:13:37,974 --> 00:13:40,216
How much did you pay
for this place?

181
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:41,431
Don't ask.

182
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:46,598
Now, wait till you see this.

183
00:13:49,111 --> 00:13:50,486
Here's the proof.

184
00:13:55,283 --> 00:13:57,442
The killer, or killers...

185
00:13:57,577 --> 00:13:59,072
they don't know which...

186
00:13:59,246 --> 00:14:02,579
smashed their way through
the back of this cabinet.

187
00:14:02,749 --> 00:14:04,457
See? There's no wall there.

188
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,535
There's only a medicine chest

189
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:08,704
separating us from
the other apartment.

190
00:14:09,923 --> 00:14:12,794
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
There could be somebody on the toilet.

191
00:14:12,884 --> 00:14:16,004
- No, the apartment is vacant.
- Are you sure?

192
00:14:18,014 --> 00:14:18,963
There.

193
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:20,516
OK, now take a look.

194
00:14:25,188 --> 00:14:27,726
(Bernadette) That is amazing.

195
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:30,651
- What?
- There's somebody there. I saw a light.

196
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:32,064
There's nobody there.

197
00:14:32,195 --> 00:14:33,144
Psych.

198
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:34,899
That's not funny.

199
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:41,694
- You didn't scare me at all.
- Yeah, right.

200
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,666
Ow.

201
00:14:46,543 --> 00:14:48,999
You don't believe
all that nonsense, do you?

202
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:51,288
I don't. Do you?

203
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,539
No.

204
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:56,208
All right.

205
00:14:57,012 --> 00:15:02,386
(Both) Candyman, Candyman,
Candyman, Candyman...

206
00:15:05,395 --> 00:15:08,230
...Candyman.

207
00:15:08,523 --> 00:15:10,849
Oh, you chicken!

208
00:15:10,984 --> 00:15:12,977
You have to do it five times.
Come on.

209
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:16,652
- (Helen) I did it.
- (Bernadette) Better safe than sorry.

210
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,002
(Rattling)

211
00:15:36,843 --> 00:15:38,551
Trevor?

212
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:48,228
No, no!

213
00:15:48,396 --> 00:15:50,223
What's the matter?

214
00:15:50,524 --> 00:15:52,184
Oh, Trevor!

215
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:54,186
Who were you expecting?

216
00:15:55,403 --> 00:15:57,195
What time is it?

217
00:15:57,364 --> 00:16:01,064
It's late and I'm smashed.

218
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:03,069
Sorry I scared you.

219
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:38,855
What's with the arsenal,
Bernadette?

220
00:16:39,197 --> 00:16:40,312
We're only going eight blocks.

221
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:43,236
You're the one who got us
dressed up like cops.

222
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:45,242
I just said dress conservatively.

223
00:16:45,412 --> 00:16:46,443
We look like cops.

224
00:16:47,497 --> 00:16:49,371
Why are you trying to scare me?

225
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,783
I'm not trying to scare you.
I just want you to think.

226
00:16:51,918 --> 00:16:53,994
The gangs hold
this neighbourhood hostage.

227
00:16:57,507 --> 00:16:59,381
OK, let's just turn around then.

228
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:02,256
Let's just go back
and we can write a boring thesis

229
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:04,967
regurgitating the usual crap
on urban legend.

230
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,642
We've got a real shot here,
Bernadette.

231
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:14,513
An entire community

232
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:18,689
starts attributing the daily horrors
of their lives to a mythical figure.

233
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:23,150
Now, if Trevor and Archie were in on this
do you think they'd chicken out?

234
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:24,867
In a second.

235
00:17:25,035 --> 00:17:27,360
Exactly.

236
00:17:27,537 --> 00:17:29,162
All right.

237
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:16,285
- You want to wait here for me?
- No.

238
00:18:17,421 --> 00:18:18,666
Well, let's go.

239
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:26,711
(Helen) And lock the car.

240
00:18:30,434 --> 00:18:31,809
(Man) Hey now.

241
00:18:32,477 --> 00:18:34,553
Want something, baby?

242
00:18:34,729 --> 00:18:36,603
I got it for you.

243
00:18:39,734 --> 00:18:41,110
Yo, baby...

244
00:18:41,862 --> 00:18:43,237
Which way you going?

245
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,486
Just going inside.

246
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:47,654
Yeah?

247
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,866
Hey, come up in here.

248
00:18:50,036 --> 00:18:51,863
Who you looking for?

249
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:53,533
A friend of ours.

250
00:18:53,707 --> 00:18:55,498
Sure you not the police?

251
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:57,910
Look like five-oh to me.

252
00:18:58,086 --> 00:19:00,921
Ask blondie where she going.

253
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:03,129
Who you going to see?

254
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:07,214
Let's take the stairs.
Come on.

255
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:12,344
(Boy whistling)

256
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,179
Hands up, people!

257
00:19:14,352 --> 00:19:17,022
Five-oh coming up
the back door.

258
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,265
It's OK
they think we're cops.

259
00:19:19,483 --> 00:19:22,270
They're not going to follow us.

260
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:29,610
Hang on.

261
00:19:51,473 --> 00:19:53,762
Look at this.

262
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,434
This is great.

263
00:19:56,603 --> 00:19:59,521
(Bernadette) "Sweets to..."

264
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:02,768
(Helen) "...to the sweet."

265
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,852
(Bernadette) "Sweets to the sweet."

266
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,862
Hurry up, Helen.

267
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,231
Let me just get the door.

268
00:20:13,495 --> 00:20:15,238
(Barking)

269
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:18,786
Sorry.

270
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,162
Jesus, Helen.

271
00:20:23,296 --> 00:20:25,372
- Here it is.
- Don't go in there.

272
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:26,966
Come on.

273
00:20:29,636 --> 00:20:30,715
Come on.

274
00:20:33,974 --> 00:20:36,262
Jesus, it stinks.

275
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:45,772
See, I was right.

276
00:20:45,902 --> 00:20:47,859
The layout is identical

277
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:50,947
which means the bathroom
is over there.

278
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,274
- Helen...
- What's the problem?

279
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,411
A woman died in there.
Leave it.

280
00:21:04,045 --> 00:21:06,999
It's all right.
There's nothing to see.

281
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,766
Wait a minute.

282
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,265
This is where he crawled
through, right?

283
00:21:20,437 --> 00:21:22,264
Yeah.

284
00:21:27,402 --> 00:21:29,359
Well, we found it.
Let's go.

285
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:30,602
Wait a second.

286
00:21:35,535 --> 00:21:37,362
OK, hang onto this.

287
00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:40,613
What?

288
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,534
I'm just going to go through

289
00:21:42,626 --> 00:21:44,702
and when I get back,
we're out of here.

290
00:21:44,878 --> 00:21:46,586
You've got to be kidding.

291
00:21:46,755 --> 00:21:48,379
It's just a derelict apartment.

292
00:21:48,548 --> 00:21:50,624
What if somebody's
packing drugs in there?

293
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:52,716
You just going to apologise
and give them your card?

294
00:21:54,763 --> 00:21:56,471
All right, let's listen.

295
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,428
(Helen) There's nobody in there.

296
00:22:04,731 --> 00:22:07,353
OK, but hurry up.

297
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,399
Be careful.

298
00:22:18,912 --> 00:22:20,490
Give me the camera.

299
00:22:20,622 --> 00:22:22,531
You've got five minutes.

300
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,409
OK, five.

301
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:25,095
(Camera motor winding)

302
00:23:25,228 --> 00:23:27,055
Dammit.

303
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:29,406
Bernadette...

304
00:24:30,877 --> 00:24:32,704
I ran out of film. I've got to back.

305
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:34,872
- No way.
- You can't believe...

306
00:24:35,048 --> 00:24:37,041
No way, Helen.
We're out of here.

307
00:24:46,226 --> 00:24:48,634
What you all doing in there?

308
00:24:48,812 --> 00:24:51,220
We're just leaving.

309
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:53,930
You here for the sweep?

310
00:24:54,067 --> 00:24:55,478
No. We're not cops.

311
00:24:55,652 --> 00:24:57,360
We're from the university.

312
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,771
Well, you don't
belong here, lady...

313
00:24:59,906 --> 00:25:02,777
going through
people's apartments and things.

314
00:25:02,951 --> 00:25:05,620
I'm Helen Lyle
and this is Bernadette Walsh.

315
00:25:05,787 --> 00:25:06,985
We're doing a thesis

316
00:25:07,164 --> 00:25:10,200
and were wondering if we could
talk to you for a few minutes.

317
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:13,117
Here, this is my card.

318
00:25:16,006 --> 00:25:17,417
(Baby crying)

319
00:25:17,591 --> 00:25:18,586
My baby.

320
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:20,466
Come on.

321
00:25:20,594 --> 00:25:22,302
Come on, let's go.

322
00:25:26,683 --> 00:25:30,432
You know, whites don't never come
here except to cause us a problem.

323
00:25:30,604 --> 00:25:33,011
Believe me that's not what we want to do.

324
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:39,648
Let's go in.

325
00:25:49,998 --> 00:25:52,667
So you say you're doing a study?

326
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:54,708
What you gonna say?

327
00:25:54,878 --> 00:25:57,369
That we bad?

328
00:25:58,131 --> 00:25:59,542
We steal?

329
00:25:59,674 --> 00:26:01,382
We gang-bang?

330
00:26:02,177 --> 00:26:04,502
We all on drugs, right?

331
00:26:05,472 --> 00:26:08,342
We ain't all like them
assholes downstairs, you know?

332
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:12,104
I just want to raise my child good.

333
00:26:12,646 --> 00:26:14,354
He's a beautiful little boy.

334
00:26:14,523 --> 00:26:16,978
And he's all I got.

335
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:20,851
- What's his name?
- Anthony.

336
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,568
I'm Anne-Marie.

337
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:29,198
Anne-Marie McCoy.

338
00:26:29,371 --> 00:26:30,450
Nice to meet you.

339
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:32,081
Sorry we disturbed you.

340
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:34,414
We'll just get out of your way.

341
00:26:34,918 --> 00:26:35,914
It's OK.

342
00:26:36,086 --> 00:26:38,328
I mean, I don't mean
to be rude, and it's...

343
00:26:38,505 --> 00:26:39,620
you know, it's just...

344
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:42,004
the white folks
that come around here

345
00:26:42,175 --> 00:26:44,666
ain't too hand-shaking
with us, you know?

346
00:26:44,928 --> 00:26:46,256
(Spitting up)

347
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:49,384
- Hey, what you doing?
- Let me help you.

348
00:26:50,767 --> 00:26:54,136
You making
a mess here?

349
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:55,350
Thank you.

350
00:26:55,564 --> 00:26:57,355
Thanks.

351
00:26:57,524 --> 00:26:58,687
You got kids?

352
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,893
No, but I'd love one.

353
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:02,563
Hey.

354
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:05,312
Got my eye on this one big time.

355
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,521
Yeah.

356
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,527
They're not going to get him.

357
00:27:18,378 --> 00:27:20,869
You want to know
about Ruthie Jean?

358
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:24,257
They all been here,
you know.

359
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:28,627
Newspapers, cops,
case workers...

360
00:27:28,805 --> 00:27:31,296
They all want to know.

361
00:27:33,435 --> 00:27:35,059
I heard her screaming.

362
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:39,514
I heard right through the walls.

363
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,982
I dialled 91 1 .

364
00:27:44,154 --> 00:27:45,981
Nobody came.

365
00:27:46,156 --> 00:27:48,065
Nobody came.

366
00:27:48,241 --> 00:27:50,151
Everybody scared.

367
00:27:50,327 --> 00:27:51,406
He could come

368
00:27:51,578 --> 00:27:53,867
right through these walls,
you know?

369
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,830
I'm scared.

370
00:27:58,251 --> 00:28:02,035
Scared for my child.

371
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:04,455
They ain't never gonna catch him.

372
00:28:04,633 --> 00:28:07,883
- Who?
- Candyman.

373
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,263
(Man laughing)

374
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:18,388
(Man) lf they asked for something, if they
saw something they liked, and you point...

375
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:21,481
They thought
it was rude to point.

376
00:28:21,608 --> 00:28:22,983
So what did
they do?

377
00:28:23,151 --> 00:28:24,645
(Grunting)

378
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,018
Spat over people.

379
00:28:26,154 --> 00:28:27,946
It was quite extraordinary.

380
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,696
- Be nice.
- I am being nice.

381
00:28:30,951 --> 00:28:35,411
So, how are the two most beautiful
graduate students getting along?

382
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:40,167
Trevor tells me you've been
dabbling in my favourite subject.

383
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:46,540
I can't wait to review your data.
I can fit you in tomorrow morning.

384
00:28:46,716 --> 00:28:47,997
We're not ready yet.

385
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:51,254
That's precisely the moment

386
00:28:51,346 --> 00:28:54,264
in which I can be
of greatest assistance

387
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:58,015
before you disappear down
a path to academic Bolivia.

388
00:28:58,353 --> 00:29:00,927
(Trevor) I've been there.

389
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,976
Actually, Purcell,
we're about to bury you.

390
00:29:04,151 --> 00:29:06,060
- Helen...
- What?

391
00:29:08,321 --> 00:29:11,157
We'll have something
in a week or so.

392
00:29:11,324 --> 00:29:13,946
It's just that we only
went to Cabrini today...

393
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:17,452
Ah! Cabrini Green?

394
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:18,903
Candyman country.

395
00:29:19,249 --> 00:29:21,954
Well, if you're after
the hook man, Helen,

396
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:25,994
you must read the paper
I wrote about him ten years ago.

397
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:28,669
You do know the story,
don't you?

398
00:29:28,842 --> 00:29:30,384
No.

399
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:42,262
Then how are you going
to bury me?

400
00:29:45,275 --> 00:29:48,359
The legend first appeared
in 1 890.

401
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:52,312
Candyman was
the son of a slave.

402
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:57,068
His father had amassed
a considerable fortune

403
00:29:57,204 --> 00:29:59,113
from designing a device

404
00:29:59,247 --> 00:30:03,459
for the mass producing of shoes
after the civil war.

405
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:06,877
Candyman had been sent
to all the best schools

406
00:30:07,047 --> 00:30:09,170
and had grown up
in polite society.

407
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:14,136
He had a prodigious talent
as an artist

408
00:30:15,305 --> 00:30:17,547
and was much sought after

409
00:30:17,724 --> 00:30:19,800
when it came to
the documenting

410
00:30:19,976 --> 00:30:24,389
of one's wealth and position
in society in a portrait.

411
00:30:24,564 --> 00:30:27,518
Well, it was in this
latter capacity

412
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:31,690
that he was commissioned
by a wealthy landowner

413
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:35,446
to capture his daughter's
virginal beauty.

414
00:30:35,575 --> 00:30:38,742
Well, of course,
they fell deeply in love

415
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,657
and she became pregnant.

416
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:49,160
Poor Candyman.

417
00:30:51,007 --> 00:30:53,961
Her father executed
a terrible revenge.

418
00:30:55,429 --> 00:31:00,304
He paid a pack of
brutal hooligans to do the deed.

419
00:31:00,434 --> 00:31:05,309
They chased Candyman
through the town to Cabrini Green

420
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,478
where they proceeded
to saw off his right hand

421
00:31:09,651 --> 00:31:11,478
with a rusty blade.

422
00:31:11,653 --> 00:31:14,903
No one came to his aid.

423
00:31:15,031 --> 00:31:16,407
(Distant screaming)

424
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:18,900
But this was just the beginning
of his ordeal.

425
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:22,529
Nearby there was
an apiary.

426
00:31:22,622 --> 00:31:25,742
Dozens of hives,
filled with hungry bees.

427
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:27,999
(Distant crying and pleading)

428
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:32,250
They smashed the hives
and stole the honeycomb

429
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:35,508
and smeared it over
his prone, naked body.

430
00:31:37,804 --> 00:31:41,090
Candyman was stung
to death by the bees.

431
00:31:43,018 --> 00:31:46,138
They burned his body
on a giant pyre

432
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,844
then scattered his ashes
over Cabrini Green.

433
00:32:03,371 --> 00:32:04,534
Hello.

434
00:32:08,877 --> 00:32:10,336
Anne-Marie ain't in.

435
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,291
Are you sure?

436
00:32:13,423 --> 00:32:16,377
Yeah. She said you'd be back.

437
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,682
What's your name?

438
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:27,974
Jake.

439
00:32:30,357 --> 00:32:33,358
Listen, Jake, maybe
you can help me out.

440
00:32:33,527 --> 00:32:36,646
I wanted to find out about
that woman who got killed.

441
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:38,613
Do you know
anything about that?

442
00:32:38,782 --> 00:32:41,355
Her name was Ruthie Jean.

443
00:32:41,535 --> 00:32:43,574
I don't know nothing.

444
00:32:44,204 --> 00:32:46,493
Did anybody else talk about it?

445
00:32:50,043 --> 00:32:54,705
You know, it's OK
to talk to me, Jake...

446
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:58,751
because I'm not a cop

447
00:32:58,927 --> 00:33:01,762
so nobody's going
to get in trouble.

448
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,088
I can't say nothing

449
00:33:04,266 --> 00:33:06,887
or Candyman will get me.

450
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,799
Candyman?

451
00:33:09,646 --> 00:33:12,398
You scared of him?

452
00:33:12,566 --> 00:33:15,436
I ain't scared of nobody

453
00:33:15,569 --> 00:33:18,570
but you're crazy
walking here on your own.

454
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:20,689
It ain't safe around here.

455
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:22,657
Yeah, I know.

456
00:33:24,995 --> 00:33:28,494
But I don't scare
too easy either, Jake.

457
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,085
You know,
you don't have to tell me.

458
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,500
You could just show me.

459
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:39,088
And if you show me
where Candyman is

460
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:41,086
I'll make you a promise.

461
00:33:42,137 --> 00:33:44,628
It will be our secret.

462
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:51,344
Unless you're too scared.

463
00:34:02,199 --> 00:34:04,571
Somebody building
a bonfire?

464
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,318
Yeah, for the party.

465
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:26,138
In there.

466
00:34:26,306 --> 00:34:28,133
Candyman's in there?

467
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,306
My friend Charlie say so.

468
00:34:30,477 --> 00:34:32,802
A boy got killed there.

469
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,273
- Who was he?
- Ain't sure.

470
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,566
Charlie tell me he was weird.

471
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:42,771
He was crazy?

472
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:44,857
No, a retard.

473
00:34:45,158 --> 00:34:47,910
His mom was in the store...

474
00:34:48,078 --> 00:34:52,206
and the boy, he need to go,
you know, to the bathroom.

475
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:55,203
His mom was
taking her time

476
00:34:55,377 --> 00:34:56,954
choosing this,
looking at that

477
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:59,584
so the boy start moaning.

478
00:34:59,756 --> 00:35:01,630
His mom get mad at him

479
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,591
send him across the street.

480
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:05,593
His mom is at the checkout.

481
00:35:05,762 --> 00:35:07,007
She hears her boy screaming.

482
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,840
(Screaming) Mommy!

483
00:35:09,015 --> 00:35:10,178
Mommy!

484
00:35:10,392 --> 00:35:12,598
There's a big tough guy.

485
00:35:12,727 --> 00:35:14,637
He runs over to check it out.

486
00:35:16,356 --> 00:35:19,274
He come out of there
shaking and crying.

487
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,856
He only been in there five seconds.

488
00:35:22,028 --> 00:35:26,275
Come out of there
and his hair turned white.

489
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:30,279
I mean, it turned white
just like that.

490
00:35:30,454 --> 00:35:32,031
Was the boy murdered?

491
00:35:32,247 --> 00:35:33,410
Worse.

492
00:35:33,582 --> 00:35:37,662
He's lying on the floor
in a pool of blood holding himself.

493
00:35:37,878 --> 00:35:42,041
(Screaming) Mommy! Mommy!

494
00:35:42,257 --> 00:35:46,207
They found it floating
in the toilet.

495
00:35:46,428 --> 00:35:47,673
Can't fix that.

496
00:35:47,888 --> 00:35:49,263
Better off dead.

497
00:35:49,431 --> 00:35:52,385
Did Candyman do this?

498
00:35:58,023 --> 00:36:01,558
Listen, you wait here for me, OK?

499
00:36:01,735 --> 00:36:02,897
OK.

500
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:21,993
Hello?

501
00:36:32,182 --> 00:36:34,969
(Coughing)

502
00:37:21,022 --> 00:37:24,189
(Buzzing)

503
00:37:38,331 --> 00:37:40,371
Candyman.

504
00:37:58,101 --> 00:38:00,141
Oh, excuse me.
I'm done here.

505
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:02,388
I'll just get out of your way.

506
00:38:08,612 --> 00:38:11,815
Listen, I don't want
to interfere with your business.

507
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,781
I'm not a cop.

508
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:16,572
I'm from the University of Illinois.

509
00:38:19,247 --> 00:38:21,157
I'll just get out of your way.

510
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,246
Come on!

511
00:38:23,418 --> 00:38:24,747
Let me go!

512
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,165
You're not being very smart.

513
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:27,962
My colleagues know where I am

514
00:38:28,131 --> 00:38:29,625
and they're expecting me back.

515
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,998
Now let me go!

516
00:38:34,096 --> 00:38:37,050
I hear you looking
for Candyman, bitch.

517
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,759
Well, you found him.

518
00:38:40,936 --> 00:38:42,763
(Helen moaning)

519
00:38:47,651 --> 00:38:49,608
(Men laughing)

520
00:38:57,244 --> 00:39:00,447
We hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

521
00:39:00,622 --> 00:39:02,330
Step back.

522
00:39:05,168 --> 00:39:06,199
Number four

523
00:39:06,294 --> 00:39:08,370
step forward
and say the line.

524
00:39:08,505 --> 00:39:11,422
We hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

525
00:39:11,508 --> 00:39:12,706
Step back.

526
00:39:15,595 --> 00:39:16,627
Number five

527
00:39:16,805 --> 00:39:18,596
step forward
and say the line.

528
00:39:18,765 --> 00:39:21,303
We hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

529
00:39:21,435 --> 00:39:22,597
Step back.

530
00:39:22,769 --> 00:39:23,884
Take 'em out.

531
00:39:35,449 --> 00:39:37,358
It's number five.

532
00:39:37,492 --> 00:39:38,821
Good work.

533
00:39:43,331 --> 00:39:44,874
How d'you catch him?

534
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,542
We swept the place.

535
00:39:46,668 --> 00:39:49,040
We start from the top floor
and work our way down.

536
00:39:49,171 --> 00:39:51,210
That way you can
flush 'em all out.

537
00:39:51,381 --> 00:39:53,623
Whole of Cabrini
is locked down now.

538
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:56,250
You're very lucky to be alive,
Ms Lyle.

539
00:39:59,681 --> 00:40:01,472
Did he kill Ruthie Jean?

540
00:40:01,641 --> 00:40:02,756
No question.

541
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:04,761
Killed that poor kid as well.

542
00:40:04,895 --> 00:40:07,516
He ran the overlords.

543
00:40:07,689 --> 00:40:09,729
We knew everything about him.

544
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,272
Only reason why we didn't
bring him in before

545
00:40:12,402 --> 00:40:14,525
because we couldn't find
anyone to testify.

546
00:40:14,696 --> 00:40:17,483
We can't protect them
down at Cabrini Green

547
00:40:17,657 --> 00:40:20,148
and they knew that.

548
00:40:20,327 --> 00:40:22,450
What about
the little boy...Jake?

549
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:24,448
We don't need him.

550
00:40:24,623 --> 00:40:26,283
We have you.

551
00:40:32,422 --> 00:40:33,964
Hey, Jake.

552
00:40:40,847 --> 00:40:43,599
I just wanted
to thank you for saving my life.

553
00:40:43,767 --> 00:40:45,558
I wanna go home.

554
00:40:45,727 --> 00:40:47,435
We'll get you out of here.

555
00:40:47,562 --> 00:40:49,222
You did good.

556
00:40:49,356 --> 00:40:52,226
You said it was our secret.
You lied!

557
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,440
It still is, Jake.

558
00:40:54,611 --> 00:40:55,726
You won't have
to go to court.

559
00:40:59,032 --> 00:41:01,488
Candyman will get me.

560
00:41:01,618 --> 00:41:04,821
Candyman isn't real.

561
00:41:04,955 --> 00:41:07,362
He's just a story.

562
00:41:07,582 --> 00:41:08,697
You know, like Dracula

563
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:10,702
or...or Frankenstein.

564
00:41:12,254 --> 00:41:16,203
A bad man took his name
so he could scare us.

565
00:41:16,383 --> 00:41:18,790
But now he's locked up
everything's going to be OK.

566
00:41:18,969 --> 00:41:22,135
Candyman ain't real?

567
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:24,260
No.

568
00:41:31,815 --> 00:41:32,978
Hey there!

569
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,312
Whoa. Slow down.

570
00:41:34,651 --> 00:41:36,311
You're supposed
to be the invalid here.

571
00:41:36,486 --> 00:41:38,526
Look, see?
It's much better today.

572
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:39,895
Yeah, it looks great.

573
00:41:40,073 --> 00:41:41,236
Come sit down.

574
00:41:56,465 --> 00:41:58,291
You haven't eaten already?

575
00:41:58,508 --> 00:42:00,501
No, of course not.

576
00:42:00,635 --> 00:42:02,462
OK, good.

577
00:42:20,447 --> 00:42:21,858
(Bernadette) Hey!

578
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:23,568
Welcome back.

579
00:42:23,742 --> 00:42:24,773
Thanks.

580
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,072
Let me see.

581
00:42:27,454 --> 00:42:30,075
I'm so glad you're OK.

582
00:42:30,248 --> 00:42:33,119
But you know what bugs me
about the whole thing?

583
00:42:33,293 --> 00:42:36,543
Two people get brutally murdered
and the cops do nothing.

584
00:42:36,713 --> 00:42:40,165
A white woman gets attacked
and they lock the place down.

585
00:42:40,342 --> 00:42:42,050
This was a bad guy.

586
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:44,792
You got him put away.
That's what matters.

587
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,681
Oh! I've got
a surprise for you.

588
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:49,094
What?

589
00:42:49,267 --> 00:42:51,805
You're not going to believe it.

590
00:42:51,978 --> 00:42:53,058
The pictures.

591
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:55,353
My friend in
the photography department

592
00:42:55,524 --> 00:42:57,184
managed to save most of them.

593
00:42:57,317 --> 00:42:58,480
I'd written them off.

594
00:42:58,652 --> 00:42:59,932
The camera was smashed.

595
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,232
(Door opens)

596
00:43:01,404 --> 00:43:03,481
I've been talking
to some publishers

597
00:43:03,657 --> 00:43:05,400
and there's a lot of interest

598
00:43:05,575 --> 00:43:07,864
since you made the local section.

599
00:43:08,036 --> 00:43:09,780
We're going to be published.

600
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:12,572
I'll come over
tomorrow at 9:00.

601
00:43:12,749 --> 00:43:14,789
- We'll get started?
- Yeah.

602
00:43:26,054 --> 00:43:27,762
(Horn honks)

603
00:43:55,459 --> 00:43:57,332
(Deep, resonating voice) Helen...

604
00:43:59,087 --> 00:44:00,665
Yes?

605
00:44:00,797 --> 00:44:03,502
Helen...

606
00:44:10,182 --> 00:44:11,842
Who is that?

607
00:44:15,479 --> 00:44:17,388
Who is that?

608
00:44:19,649 --> 00:44:21,309
Helen...

609
00:44:21,485 --> 00:44:24,272
I came for you.

610
00:44:44,216 --> 00:44:45,924
Do I know you?

611
00:44:46,134 --> 00:44:49,135
No...no...

612
00:44:49,262 --> 00:44:51,421
but you doubted me.

613
00:44:51,681 --> 00:44:52,962
I'm sorry.

614
00:44:53,058 --> 00:44:54,338
I have to go.

615
00:44:54,518 --> 00:44:57,009
No need to leave yet.

616
00:45:01,483 --> 00:45:04,021
But I'm late.

617
00:45:04,236 --> 00:45:08,613
You were not content
with the stories

618
00:45:08,782 --> 00:45:10,988
so I was obliged to come.

619
00:45:15,956 --> 00:45:19,075
Be my victim.

620
00:45:23,046 --> 00:45:25,418
Be my victim.

621
00:45:27,592 --> 00:45:31,542
I am the writing on the wall

622
00:45:31,763 --> 00:45:34,764
the whisper in the classroom.

623
00:45:34,933 --> 00:45:38,432
Without these things
I am nothing

624
00:45:38,645 --> 00:45:42,310
so now I must shed
innocent blood.

625
00:45:42,482 --> 00:45:43,763
Come with me.

626
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:47,684
(Woman screaming)

627
00:45:48,071 --> 00:45:50,396
(lncoherent screaming)

628
00:45:53,702 --> 00:45:57,035
(Hysterical crying)

629
00:45:57,205 --> 00:45:59,661
(Woman) No!

630
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:02,329
(Hysterical crying)

631
00:46:15,015 --> 00:46:17,257
Anthony!

632
00:46:17,434 --> 00:46:19,343
Anthony!

633
00:46:20,896 --> 00:46:24,644
No! No! No!

634
00:46:24,775 --> 00:46:27,063
No, Anthony!

635
00:46:27,277 --> 00:46:29,685
Anthony!

636
00:46:29,863 --> 00:46:35,023
(Hysterical screaming)

637
00:46:36,453 --> 00:46:38,860
Anthony!

638
00:46:39,414 --> 00:46:40,908
Anne-Marie?

639
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:42,281
No! You did it!

640
00:46:42,501 --> 00:46:44,244
You! You did it!

641
00:46:44,419 --> 00:46:45,700
You murdered my baby!

642
00:46:45,754 --> 00:46:48,957
(Screaming)

643
00:46:49,966 --> 00:46:51,461
You murderer!

644
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:54,335
No! No!

645
00:46:54,513 --> 00:46:55,841
Stop! Please, stop!

646
00:46:58,683 --> 00:46:59,763
(Screaming)

647
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,183
Now stop!

648
00:47:03,355 --> 00:47:04,814
Stop!

649
00:47:04,981 --> 00:47:06,689
Police! Open up!

650
00:47:06,817 --> 00:47:08,726
All right,
hold it right there!

651
00:47:08,902 --> 00:47:09,933
Back away! Now!

652
00:47:10,779 --> 00:47:11,858
(Screams)

653
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,109
Look out!

654
00:47:15,826 --> 00:47:17,902
(Helicopter flying overhead)

655
00:47:32,134 --> 00:47:33,414
Remove your sweater.

656
00:47:33,552 --> 00:47:35,046
(Weeping)

657
00:47:40,392 --> 00:47:42,799
Drop it and slide it over to me.

658
00:47:46,022 --> 00:47:47,814
Take off your brassiere.

659
00:47:50,235 --> 00:47:53,604
Can I please take a shower?

660
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,654
Oh...

661
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,443
Oh, God...

662
00:48:00,662 --> 00:48:02,951
Drop it,
slide it over to me.

663
00:48:07,127 --> 00:48:08,372
Lift up your arms.

664
00:48:08,545 --> 00:48:10,787
(Crying)

665
00:48:10,964 --> 00:48:13,716
Lift your left breast.

666
00:48:13,884 --> 00:48:14,915
Your right.

667
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,552
Remove your underwear.

668
00:48:21,725 --> 00:48:25,888
Can I please speak
with detective Valento?

669
00:48:25,979 --> 00:48:27,972
Remove your underwear.

670
00:48:31,526 --> 00:48:32,855
Frank.

671
00:48:40,535 --> 00:48:42,694
Ms Lyle, you're under arrest.

672
00:48:42,871 --> 00:48:44,246
Do you understand?

673
00:48:48,877 --> 00:48:51,083
Please let me explain.

674
00:48:51,254 --> 00:48:53,081
Do you understand?

675
00:48:54,382 --> 00:48:55,877
Yes, but...

676
00:48:56,051 --> 00:48:57,213
You have the right

677
00:48:57,344 --> 00:48:58,968
to remain silent.

678
00:48:59,137 --> 00:49:00,881
Do you understand?

679
00:49:01,056 --> 00:49:03,725
This is crazy.
I was attacked.

680
00:49:03,892 --> 00:49:05,351
Respond to the question.

681
00:49:08,271 --> 00:49:10,145
I understand.

682
00:49:10,315 --> 00:49:12,771
(Frank) At approximately 1 0:00 pm.

683
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:16,521
Anne-Marie McCoy
returned to her apartment.

684
00:49:16,738 --> 00:49:20,570
She discovered her dog
with its head cut off.

685
00:49:20,742 --> 00:49:22,534
She cried for assistance

686
00:49:22,702 --> 00:49:26,321
at which point you attacked her
with a meat cleaver.

687
00:49:26,581 --> 00:49:29,416
You were still in possession
of this weapon

688
00:49:29,584 --> 00:49:33,285
when the arresting officers
came to her aid.

689
00:49:33,463 --> 00:49:37,046
(O'Malley) Where's the baby?

690
00:49:37,175 --> 00:49:38,967
I...l don't know.

691
00:49:39,094 --> 00:49:40,374
You're sick.

692
00:49:47,436 --> 00:49:50,009
(Frank) Before I ask any
further questions

693
00:49:50,147 --> 00:49:52,270
would you like
to have counsel?

694
00:49:52,441 --> 00:49:53,603
(Pounds hand on table)

695
00:49:53,733 --> 00:49:56,059
Yes or no?

696
00:49:58,405 --> 00:50:00,444
I...l'd like to make a phone call.

697
00:50:00,615 --> 00:50:02,857
(Ringing)

698
00:50:09,916 --> 00:50:14,662
(Phone continues ringing)

699
00:50:14,838 --> 00:50:17,673
(Trevor) I'm sorry,
we can't take your call.

700
00:50:17,841 --> 00:50:20,546
Please leave a message
after the tone.

701
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:21,750
(Tone beeps)

702
00:50:21,928 --> 00:50:24,336
Trevor, are you there?
Pick up.

703
00:50:26,391 --> 00:50:28,051
It's an emergency, Trevor.

704
00:50:28,226 --> 00:50:29,341
Pick up the phone.

705
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:32,224
I've been arrested.

706
00:50:32,439 --> 00:50:34,764
I'm at the 1 8th district.

707
00:50:34,941 --> 00:50:38,357
Can you...
can you please come pick me up?

708
00:50:38,612 --> 00:50:41,185
That's it.

709
00:50:41,323 --> 00:50:45,023
Do you know what time it is?

710
00:50:45,202 --> 00:50:48,037
3:00 am.

711
00:50:48,205 --> 00:50:49,782
(Door clangs shut)

712
00:50:49,956 --> 00:50:51,581
(Keys jingling)

713
00:51:17,734 --> 00:51:21,269
(Cooing)

714
00:51:21,446 --> 00:51:24,400
(Anne-Marie crying hysterically)
Noooo!

715
00:51:24,574 --> 00:51:26,900
No!

716
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:30,910
(Door being unlocked)

717
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:34,120
Oh, God.

718
00:51:35,419 --> 00:51:37,660
There's got to be
another way out.

719
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:40,163
(Attorney) Cover her face.
Don't say anything.

720
00:51:41,091 --> 00:51:42,633
(Trevor) OK.

721
00:51:42,759 --> 00:51:43,790
(Attorney) All right.

722
00:51:43,969 --> 00:51:46,008
You'll be fine.

723
00:51:46,179 --> 00:51:47,923
(Reporters shouting)

724
00:51:50,058 --> 00:51:51,552
Just keep your head down.

725
00:51:51,726 --> 00:51:53,351
It's going to be fine.

726
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:59,062
All right, people,
back off, back off!

727
00:51:59,234 --> 00:52:00,432
We have no comment.

728
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:02,354
No comment.
Nothing to say.

729
00:52:02,571 --> 00:52:04,480
Do you know
the baby's whereabouts?

730
00:52:04,656 --> 00:52:06,198
My client has
not been charged

731
00:52:06,324 --> 00:52:07,404
with a thing!

732
00:52:07,576 --> 00:52:09,200
(Woman) lnformation has indicated

733
00:52:09,369 --> 00:52:12,536
that baby Anthony was abducted
and may still be alive.

734
00:52:12,789 --> 00:52:15,031
The blood may have come
from the dog.

735
00:52:15,208 --> 00:52:16,868
A suspect was released

736
00:52:17,043 --> 00:52:18,787
this morning after questioning

737
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,411
and I guess we'll just
have to follow this one...

738
00:52:23,341 --> 00:52:26,295
Well, at least they didn't
mention your name.

739
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:27,880
That's good.

740
00:52:30,932 --> 00:52:34,301
Now, they haven't charged you,
because they think

741
00:52:34,436 --> 00:52:35,764
they'll find the body

742
00:52:35,937 --> 00:52:37,480
which means, I'm afraid

743
00:52:37,606 --> 00:52:39,479
they're shooting for murder one,

744
00:52:39,649 --> 00:52:41,725
but I don't think they have a chance.

745
00:52:45,322 --> 00:52:47,231
Do you think I did it?

746
00:52:47,365 --> 00:52:48,908
No. Nobody believes that.

747
00:52:50,786 --> 00:52:52,612
But it's crossed your mind?

748
00:52:57,417 --> 00:52:58,828
Is there anything,

749
00:52:58,919 --> 00:53:02,252
any detail, however small,
that you can recall,

750
00:53:02,422 --> 00:53:06,420
that would help us substantiate
your version of events?

751
00:53:06,593 --> 00:53:08,550
I...l blacked out.

752
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,045
I mean,
I don't know what happened.

753
00:53:11,181 --> 00:53:15,558
I just woke up in that place
and there was blood everywhere.

754
00:53:34,329 --> 00:53:35,574
Can I get you anything?

755
00:53:39,751 --> 00:53:41,827
Are you sure?

756
00:53:52,681 --> 00:53:53,594
Look, honey...

757
00:53:53,765 --> 00:53:56,850
I was supposed to go to the campus
and pick up some work.

758
00:53:57,018 --> 00:53:59,592
I'm concerned about
leaving you alone though.

759
00:54:01,231 --> 00:54:03,271
I'll only be
about 20 minutes.

760
00:54:03,442 --> 00:54:04,390
Trevor...

761
00:54:08,071 --> 00:54:10,645
Where were you last night?

762
00:54:10,824 --> 00:54:13,362
I was here.
I was fast asleep.

763
00:54:13,535 --> 00:54:16,951
I thought you were
with Bernadette.

764
00:54:18,957 --> 00:54:20,748
Look, honey...

765
00:54:20,917 --> 00:54:22,412
I'm going to stand by you.

766
00:54:22,586 --> 00:54:25,705
We're going to get through this OK?

767
00:54:27,507 --> 00:54:29,049
I'll be right back.

768
00:54:36,641 --> 00:54:38,052
(Door closes)

769
00:57:51,503 --> 00:57:52,666
(Screams)

770
00:57:52,838 --> 00:57:54,711
Believe in me.

771
00:57:54,881 --> 00:57:55,961
Be my victim.

772
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:14,351
Do you believe in me?

773
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,985
Keep away from me.

774
00:58:17,154 --> 00:58:18,696
I have the child.

775
00:58:18,864 --> 00:58:23,111
Allow me to take you
or he will die in your place.

776
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:28,654
Your disbelief

777
00:58:28,832 --> 00:58:32,117
destroyed the faith
of my congregation.

778
00:58:32,294 --> 00:58:34,619
Without them,
I am nothing.

779
00:58:34,796 --> 00:58:37,916
So I was obliged to come.

780
00:58:38,091 --> 00:58:40,878
And now I must kill you.

781
00:58:42,095 --> 00:58:45,879
Your death will be a tale
to frighten children,

782
00:58:46,057 --> 00:58:49,806
to make lovers cling closer
in their rapture.

783
00:58:49,936 --> 00:58:54,314
Come with me
and be immortal.

784
00:58:54,483 --> 00:58:56,689
(Groans)

785
00:59:08,205 --> 00:59:09,200
Helen?

786
00:59:16,046 --> 00:59:17,955
Bernadette...

787
00:59:21,259 --> 00:59:22,802
Bernadette, go.

788
00:59:22,969 --> 00:59:24,084
Helen?

789
00:59:26,098 --> 00:59:27,212
Helen, honey.

790
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:28,635
It's Bernadette.

791
00:59:28,809 --> 00:59:29,923
Let me in.

792
00:59:30,102 --> 00:59:31,181
He's here.

793
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,941
Bernadette, go!

794
00:59:43,615 --> 00:59:45,358
Helen!

795
00:59:45,534 --> 00:59:47,076
Helen?

796
00:59:47,244 --> 00:59:49,450
(Helen) Go! Get out!

797
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:52,822
(Moans)

798
00:59:52,958 --> 00:59:56,124
(Helen) Oh, no, no....

799
00:59:59,965 --> 01:00:02,171
(Bernadette screaming)

800
01:00:02,342 --> 01:00:04,833
(Flesh ripping)

801
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:07,675
(Candyman grunting)

802
01:00:14,104 --> 01:00:15,978
(Footsteps approaching)

803
01:00:22,487 --> 01:00:24,231
Trevor...

804
01:00:24,364 --> 01:00:26,689
Trevor, he's here.

805
01:00:26,825 --> 01:00:28,652
He's here. He's...

806
01:00:28,827 --> 01:00:30,369
...here.

807
01:00:34,958 --> 01:00:36,867
(Thinking) Don't let him kill me.

808
01:00:41,131 --> 01:00:42,329
Trevor...

809
01:00:51,183 --> 01:00:52,760
Trevor...

810
01:00:56,229 --> 01:00:57,261
Trevor...

811
01:00:58,982 --> 01:01:00,227
Trevor!

812
01:01:02,903 --> 01:01:04,017
Trevor!

813
01:01:04,196 --> 01:01:07,565
Trevor! Trevor!

814
01:01:07,741 --> 01:01:08,820
(Moans)

815
01:01:16,291 --> 01:01:17,322
Take her outside.

816
01:01:19,544 --> 01:01:22,581
Trevor...

817
01:01:22,756 --> 01:01:24,583
Hold me, Trevor, please?

818
01:01:34,851 --> 01:01:36,393
(Dispatcher) 'That's correct.

819
01:01:40,649 --> 01:01:42,725
'Unit 212, come in, please.'

820
01:01:46,947 --> 01:01:50,565
(Candyman) 'Why do you want to live?

821
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:53,322
'lf you had learned
just a little from me

822
01:01:53,453 --> 01:01:56,205

830
01:02:40,751 --> 01:02:42,126
(Helen) 'Please, God,

831
01:02:42,294 --> 01:02:45,164
'don't let him kill the baby.'

832
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:12,818
Trevor!

833
01:03:14,034 --> 01:03:16,323
Trevor?

834
01:03:18,789 --> 01:03:20,164
Trevor!

835
01:03:36,389 --> 01:03:38,927
Where are you going?

836
01:03:39,101 --> 01:03:40,927
No, you can't leave me here.

837
01:03:41,103 --> 01:03:43,890
I can't defend myself!

838
01:04:04,042 --> 01:04:05,786
No.

839
01:04:07,671 --> 01:04:10,588
What do the good know

840
01:04:10,757 --> 01:04:14,209
except what the bad teach them
by their excesses?

841
01:04:14,386 --> 01:04:16,425
Murderer.

842
01:04:16,596 --> 01:04:18,803
Allow me at least a kiss.

843
01:04:18,974 --> 01:04:22,058
Just one exquisite kiss.

844
01:04:22,227 --> 01:04:23,935
(Crying)

845
01:04:24,104 --> 01:04:25,646
Murderer!

846
01:04:25,814 --> 01:04:27,094
Help!

847
01:04:27,232 --> 01:04:29,225
Listen, he's under the bed!

848
01:04:31,611 --> 01:04:33,355
Bring me 1 ,000 mils!

849
01:04:33,488 --> 01:04:35,148
Listen, he's here.

850
01:04:35,323 --> 01:04:36,652
He's under the bed!

851
01:04:36,825 --> 01:04:38,485
No, don't.

852
01:04:57,429 --> 01:05:00,632
(Baby cooing)

853
01:05:38,553 --> 01:05:40,510
(Coughing)

854
01:05:41,807 --> 01:05:43,598
She's coming around.

855
01:05:43,725 --> 01:05:45,136
Good morning.

856
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:47,386
I'd like to speak
to my husband.

857
01:05:47,562 --> 01:05:48,594
(Chuckles)

858
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:50,059
So would l.

859
01:05:50,232 --> 01:05:51,181
Here we go.

860
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:52,900
What time is it?

861
01:05:53,068 --> 01:05:54,895
Where are we going?

862
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:56,778
We're going to Disneyland.

863
01:06:10,001 --> 01:06:12,160
Clyde, open it up.

864
01:06:12,337 --> 01:06:13,286
Winley?

865
01:06:13,463 --> 01:06:15,123
Clyde, open it up.

866
01:06:15,298 --> 01:06:18,050
What the hell you all
doing back there, huh?

867
01:06:18,218 --> 01:06:19,629
A little reading?

868
01:06:21,346 --> 01:06:23,006
Break.

869
01:06:26,309 --> 01:06:28,053
Dr Burke?

870
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:29,265
Yes?

871
01:06:33,483 --> 01:06:35,808
Miss Lyle,
I'm Dr Burke.

872
01:06:40,699 --> 01:06:44,743
(Door opens, closes)

873
01:06:44,953 --> 01:06:47,409
I'd like to speak to my husband.

874
01:06:47,581 --> 01:06:49,573
I'm sure we can arrange a visit.

875
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:51,327
A visit?

876
01:06:51,501 --> 01:06:53,161
Have I been committed?

877
01:06:59,176 --> 01:07:02,710
Do you really think
these restraints are necessary?

878
01:07:05,932 --> 01:07:08,305
Helen, this...

879
01:07:08,477 --> 01:07:10,101
is a writ of detention

880
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:12,595
from the state
attorney's office.

881
01:07:12,773 --> 01:07:14,564
Now, for
the past month...

882
01:07:14,733 --> 01:07:17,140
- Month?
- Yes.

883
01:07:17,277 --> 01:07:21,489
...we have been stabilizing you
on a heavy dosage of Thorazine.

884
01:07:21,656 --> 01:07:24,741
You probably remember
very little or nothing.

885
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:26,819
Get me my attorney.

886
01:07:26,995 --> 01:07:29,153
I'm working for
your defence.

887
01:07:29,372 --> 01:07:32,788
We have to assess
your ability to stand trial.

888
01:07:32,959 --> 01:07:37,502
Helen, you've been charged
with first-degree murder.

889
01:07:46,848 --> 01:07:49,933
Why don't you tell me
what happened in your apartment?

890
01:08:16,503 --> 01:08:17,748
'Oh!'

891
01:08:20,841 --> 01:08:22,465
The night
you were admitted

892
01:08:22,634 --> 01:08:25,207
did the killer
appear to you?

893
01:08:25,345 --> 01:08:27,254
'Murderer!

894
01:08:27,431 --> 01:08:28,545
'Murderer!

895
01:08:28,682 --> 01:08:30,556
'Murderer!

896
01:08:30,725 --> 01:08:32,184
'Help me!

897
01:08:32,352 --> 01:08:33,727
(Grunting)

898
01:08:33,895 --> 01:08:36,137
'He's here!

899
01:08:36,314 --> 01:08:37,857
'He's under the bed!

900
01:08:38,024 --> 01:08:39,353
'No!

901
01:08:39,526 --> 01:08:40,771
'Help me!'

902
01:08:40,944 --> 01:08:42,319
I don't understand.

903
01:08:42,446 --> 01:08:44,687
'Help! Please!

904
01:08:44,906 --> 01:08:45,938
'He's here!

905
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:48,150
'Help me! Help me!

906
01:08:48,285 --> 01:08:49,447
'Please!

907
01:08:50,579 --> 01:08:51,777
'He's under the bed!

908
01:08:51,913 --> 01:08:53,028
'He's under the bed!'

909
01:08:53,248 --> 01:08:54,493
That's not possible.

910
01:08:54,624 --> 01:08:56,368
(Man) 'Bring me 1 ,000 mils!'

911
01:09:01,798 --> 01:09:03,174
Bernadette...

912
01:09:13,477 --> 01:09:15,469
I'm not capable of that.

913
01:09:21,651 --> 01:09:24,855
No matter what's going wrong...

914
01:09:25,322 --> 01:09:26,816
I know one thing...

915
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:28,781
...that no part of me,

916
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:31,109
no matter how hidden

917
01:09:31,244 --> 01:09:32,787
is capable of that.

918
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,330
I can prove it.

919
01:09:41,463 --> 01:09:42,743
How?

920
01:09:45,842 --> 01:09:47,384
I can call him.

921
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:00,189
Candyman...

922
01:10:00,273 --> 01:10:01,851
Candyman...

923
01:10:02,025 --> 01:10:03,899
Candyman...

924
01:10:04,027 --> 01:10:05,521
Candyman...

925
01:10:15,664 --> 01:10:17,953
...Candyman.

926
01:10:35,642 --> 01:10:36,923
(Grunts)

927
01:10:37,102 --> 01:10:38,679
(Flesh ripping)

928
01:10:38,854 --> 01:10:40,514
Oh! Oh!

929
01:10:40,897 --> 01:10:44,231
(Yelling)

930
01:10:44,609 --> 01:10:47,231
(Grunting)

931
01:10:52,784 --> 01:10:55,192
You're mine now.

932
01:10:55,328 --> 01:11:00,999
Tonight our congregation
shall witness a new...miracle.

933
01:11:01,126 --> 01:11:02,668
(Flesh tearing)

934
01:11:18,643 --> 01:11:20,387
(Alarm ringing)

935
01:11:20,562 --> 01:11:21,760
(Woman) Dr Burke?

936
01:11:25,275 --> 01:11:26,354
(Knocking)

937
01:11:26,526 --> 01:11:28,270
Dr Burke?

938
01:11:28,445 --> 01:11:30,105
Dr Burke!

939
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:32,605
Please answer us!

940
01:11:32,783 --> 01:11:34,905
Dr Burke!

941
01:11:49,549 --> 01:11:51,091
(Grunts)

942
01:12:05,148 --> 01:12:08,564
Code nine to ward b-5, stat.

943
01:12:14,783 --> 01:12:16,491
Check the west wing.

944
01:12:19,746 --> 01:12:21,075
Let's go!

945
01:12:21,248 --> 01:12:22,528
Go, go, go!

946
01:12:24,543 --> 01:12:27,746
Do we have a direction on this one?
Where is she?

947
01:12:27,921 --> 01:12:29,201
(Elevator bell rings)

948
01:12:49,276 --> 01:12:51,149
Please be home, Trevor.

949
01:12:51,278 --> 01:12:52,606
Please be home.

950
01:13:07,586 --> 01:13:10,124
(Creaking)

951
01:13:50,295 --> 01:13:51,789
Get out of my home.

952
01:13:54,508 --> 01:13:56,381
(Agitated) Trevor!

953
01:13:56,551 --> 01:13:58,295
What's the matter, sweetie pie?

954
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:00,546
Did you make another little boo-boo?

955
01:14:01,765 --> 01:14:03,971
What are you doing here?

956
01:14:04,142 --> 01:14:06,894
I live here, remember?

957
01:14:07,062 --> 01:14:08,686
Call the hospital.

958
01:14:12,859 --> 01:14:14,982
Don't touch the phone.

959
01:14:29,084 --> 01:14:30,744
What's the matter, Trevor?

960
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:35,336
Scared of something?

961
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:50,015
I hate the color scheme.

962
01:14:53,066 --> 01:14:54,560
What were you going to do?

963
01:14:54,734 --> 01:14:57,023
Wait till I got out
before you told me?!

964
01:14:57,863 --> 01:14:59,108
Helen...

965
01:14:59,281 --> 01:15:01,736
But you knew
I was never coming out,

966
01:15:01,908 --> 01:15:03,153
didn't you?

967
01:15:04,411 --> 01:15:06,902
I think we should call the hospital.

968
01:15:10,417 --> 01:15:11,876
OK.

969
01:15:13,962 --> 01:15:14,993
(Dial tone)

970
01:15:15,172 --> 01:15:16,120
Go on.

971
01:15:18,258 --> 01:15:19,586
Go on.

972
01:15:19,801 --> 01:15:21,628
Is that what you want to do?

973
01:15:23,305 --> 01:15:26,140
Call them.

974
01:15:51,374 --> 01:15:54,541
I'm not a murderer.

975
01:15:55,087 --> 01:15:57,412
I'm not.

976
01:15:58,006 --> 01:16:01,707
Trevor, you were all I had left.

977
01:16:03,845 --> 01:16:05,090
Oh...

978
01:16:09,684 --> 01:16:12,222
(Fast busy signal)

979
01:16:23,657 --> 01:16:25,032
It's over.

980
01:16:35,544 --> 01:16:37,038
(Busy signal stops)

981
01:16:37,212 --> 01:16:40,663
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

982
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:04,359
(Candyman) They will all abandon you.

983
01:17:14,958 --> 01:17:20,415
All you have left
is my desire for you.

984
01:17:40,859 --> 01:17:42,898
(Laughing and chattering)

985
01:19:42,814 --> 01:19:47,108
(Many voices in the distance
shouting "Candyman!")

986
01:19:52,657 --> 01:19:55,195
(Laughter and shouting
in the distance)

987
01:20:10,801 --> 01:20:12,627
(Rasping, heavy breathing)

988
01:21:09,734 --> 01:21:11,229
Helen.

989
01:21:13,822 --> 01:21:15,980
You came to me.

990
01:21:18,243 --> 01:21:19,737
The child.

991
01:21:22,038 --> 01:21:23,865
We had a deal.

992
01:21:24,082 --> 01:21:26,490
Surrender to me now

993
01:21:26,668 --> 01:21:29,918
and he shall be unharmed.

994
01:21:41,808 --> 01:21:43,600
We have a bargain.

995
01:21:43,769 --> 01:21:45,642
But I'm afraid.

996
01:21:45,771 --> 01:21:48,606
Do you fear the pain
or what is beyond?

997
01:21:48,774 --> 01:21:50,268
Both.

998
01:21:50,442 --> 01:21:54,309
The pain, I can assure you,
will be exquisite.

999
01:21:54,488 --> 01:21:58,188
As for our deaths,
there is nothing to fear.

1000
01:21:58,366 --> 01:22:02,530
Our names will be written
on a thousand walls.

1001
01:22:02,704 --> 01:22:04,531
Our crimes told

1002
01:22:04,706 --> 01:22:08,407
and retold
by our faithful believers.

1003
01:22:08,585 --> 01:22:12,665
We shall die together
in front of their very eyes

1004
01:22:12,839 --> 01:22:15,211
and give them something

1005
01:22:15,383 --> 01:22:17,257
to be haunted by.

1006
01:22:17,385 --> 01:22:18,928
Come with me

1007
01:22:20,055 --> 01:22:22,593
and be immortal.

1008
01:22:30,023 --> 01:22:31,767
(Screaming)

1009
01:22:36,113 --> 01:22:37,311
No!

1010
01:22:46,081 --> 01:22:48,157
No!

1011
01:22:50,335 --> 01:22:52,162
(Crunching)

1012
01:23:05,851 --> 01:23:07,724
(Candyman) Hush.

1013
01:23:09,688 --> 01:23:11,182
Hush.

1014
01:23:11,356 --> 01:23:14,310
You're mine now.

1015
01:23:14,443 --> 01:23:17,693
It's time for a new miracle.

1016
01:23:23,743 --> 01:23:25,072
(Baby squeals)

1017
01:23:38,341 --> 01:23:40,085
(Metallic clattering)

1018
01:24:39,361 --> 01:24:42,564
(Candyman) It was always you, Helen.

1019
01:24:42,739 --> 01:24:44,946
It was always you.

1020
01:24:45,242 --> 01:24:46,866
(Baby crying)

1021
01:24:54,084 --> 01:24:56,373
(Crying continues)

1022
01:24:59,756 --> 01:25:02,128
(Crying gets louder)

1023
01:25:23,447 --> 01:25:25,238
(Crying)

1024
01:26:01,735 --> 01:26:04,060
He's here.

1025
01:26:37,979 --> 01:26:39,355
I'm coming.

1026
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:47,112
It's OK.

1027
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,985
Check it out, man.

1028
01:26:51,993 --> 01:26:54,069
Oh, yes.

1029
01:26:54,246 --> 01:26:56,819
(Man) What happened?

1030
01:26:56,998 --> 01:27:00,450
(Man #2) We got the Candyman out there.

1031
01:27:00,627 --> 01:27:02,916
(Jake) I saw him go in there.

1032
01:27:03,171 --> 01:27:04,998
Candyman's in there.

1033
01:27:05,173 --> 01:27:06,751
I saw him.

1034
01:27:06,925 --> 01:27:09,463
(Crying)

1035
01:27:12,097 --> 01:27:13,971
I knew you'd come.

1036
01:27:15,434 --> 01:27:17,307
Burn him.

1037
01:27:21,648 --> 01:27:23,641
Hush.

1038
01:27:23,817 --> 01:27:27,601
Burn him, burn him,
burn him, burn him...

1039
01:27:27,779 --> 01:27:29,986
(Muffled cry)

1040
01:27:30,157 --> 01:27:33,193
(Crowd chanting)
Burn him, burn him!

1041
01:27:33,368 --> 01:27:35,942
Help!

1042
01:27:36,121 --> 01:27:38,991
Burn him, burn him, burn him!

1043
01:27:39,166 --> 01:27:41,491
Help...help me!

1044
01:27:41,668 --> 01:27:43,577
Burn him, burn him!

1045
01:27:43,754 --> 01:27:46,957
You lied to me!

1046
01:27:47,090 --> 01:27:51,254
We must be on our way now,
you and l.

1047
01:27:51,428 --> 01:27:53,835
Our bones will soon be ashes

1048
01:27:54,014 --> 01:27:56,849
and we shall never

1049
01:27:57,017 --> 01:27:58,428
be separated again.

1050
01:27:58,602 --> 01:27:59,882
Let me go.

1051
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:01,348
I cannot.

1052
01:28:01,521 --> 01:28:04,475
We are already dead.

1053
01:28:04,649 --> 01:28:05,764
(Baby crying)

1054
01:28:12,282 --> 01:28:13,860
Helen!

1055
01:28:14,451 --> 01:28:15,826
(Screaming)

1056
01:28:25,962 --> 01:28:28,880
(Screaming in pain)

1057
01:28:36,598 --> 01:28:38,057
(Angry yelling)

1058
01:28:38,683 --> 01:28:40,226
(Groans loudly)

1059
01:28:48,985 --> 01:28:50,859
Come back to me!

1060
01:29:02,416 --> 01:29:04,325
Come back!

1061
01:29:04,501 --> 01:29:06,873
(Baby crying)

1062
01:29:28,233 --> 01:29:31,068
(Screaming)

1063
01:30:13,862 --> 01:30:17,112
(Minister) We commend to almighty God
our sister Helen

1064
01:30:17,282 --> 01:30:20,069
and we commit her body
to the ground.

1065
01:30:20,243 --> 01:30:23,826
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

1066
01:30:23,997 --> 01:30:27,448
The lord bless her and keep her
and give her peace.

1067
01:30:27,584 --> 01:30:29,624
God of holiness and power

1068
01:30:29,753 --> 01:30:33,122
accept our prayers on behalf
of your servant Helen.

1069
01:30:33,256 --> 01:30:35,582
Do not count
her deeds against her.

1070
01:30:35,842 --> 01:30:39,092
For in her heart she desired
to do your will.

1071
01:30:39,221 --> 01:30:41,094
May almighty God bless you

1072
01:30:41,306 --> 01:30:44,011
the Father and the Son
and the Holy Spirit.

1073
01:30:52,275 --> 01:30:55,110
(Man) My God, look at that.

1074
01:30:57,364 --> 01:30:59,273
Trevor?

1075
01:32:13,648 --> 01:32:15,273
(Stacey) Trevor?

1076
01:32:16,443 --> 01:32:19,112
What is it?

1077
01:32:19,279 --> 01:32:21,070
Trevor, are you all right?

1078
01:32:21,239 --> 01:32:23,861
Yeah, I'm fine.

1079
01:32:23,992 --> 01:32:26,744
Aren't you hungry?

1080
01:32:26,912 --> 01:32:28,406
No, I'm OK.

1081
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:30,738
I'll eat a little bit later.

1082
01:32:30,916 --> 01:32:34,415
I was going to make us
a nice dinner.

1083
01:32:34,628 --> 01:32:36,336
OK, whatever.

1084
01:33:18,422 --> 01:33:21,791
Hey, why don't you help me
make the salad?

1085
01:33:23,260 --> 01:33:26,177
OK, I'll be there
in a minute.

1086
01:33:35,772 --> 01:33:37,599
Helen...

1087
01:33:46,825 --> 01:33:49,530
Oh, Helen.

1088
01:33:54,374 --> 01:33:56,082
Helen.

1089
01:34:01,882 --> 01:34:03,673
Helen.

1090
01:34:09,765 --> 01:34:11,638
Helen.

1091
01:34:11,975 --> 01:34:14,051
Ow.

1092
01:34:18,607 --> 01:34:20,646
What's the matter, Trevor?

1093
01:34:20,776 --> 01:34:22,852
Scared of something?

1094
01:34:25,530 --> 01:34:27,357
(Flesh tearing)

1095
01:34:30,702 --> 01:34:32,908
(Death rattle)

1096
01:34:33,038 --> 01:34:35,280
Trevor?

1097
01:34:35,457 --> 01:34:38,244
My God, Trevor?

1098
01:34:38,418 --> 01:34:39,533
Trevor?

1099
01:34:40,796 --> 01:34:42,705
Trevor!

1100
01:34:42,839 --> 01:34:44,962
(Screaming)
