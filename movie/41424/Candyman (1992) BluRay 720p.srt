1
00:02:34,725 --> 00:02:40,763
"They will say that I have shed
innocent blood."

2
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:46,066
"What's blood for
if not for shedding?"

3
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:49,905
"With my hook for a hand...

4
00:02:50,074 --> 00:02:54,118
I'll split you from your groin
to your gullet."

5
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:18,549
"I came for you."

6
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:27,394
This is the scariest story
I've ever heard

7
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,229
and it's totally true.

8
00:03:29,447 --> 00:03:33,148
"It happened a few years ago
near Moses lake in Indiana."

9
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:35,900
"Clara was baby-sitting
for the Johnsons...

10
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:39,612
and Billy pulls up
on his motorcycle."

11
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:41,866
"She wasn't even
going out with Billy."

12
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:44,082
"She was going out with Michael
for about six months...

13
00:03:44,378 --> 00:03:47,581
but she always kind of had
the hots for Billy..

14
00:03:47,882 --> 00:03:49,708
because he was like a bad boy..

15
00:03:49,884 --> 00:03:52,636
and Michael was...
he was just so nice."

16
00:03:52,971 --> 00:03:55,592
"So anyway, she decides
that tonight's the night..

17
00:03:55,724 --> 00:03:59,936
that she's going to give Billy
what she never gave to Michael."

18
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:02,220
Have you ever heard of Candyman?

19
00:04:02,396 --> 00:04:03,227
No.

20
00:04:03,356 --> 00:04:05,847
His right hand is sawn off.

21
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:10,900
He has a hook jammed
in the bloody stump

22
00:04:11,071 --> 00:04:13,609
and if you look in the mirror

23
00:04:13,783 --> 00:04:16,571
and you say his name five times

24
00:04:16,745 --> 00:04:20,529
he'll appear behind you,
breathing down your neck.

25
00:04:20,915 --> 00:04:22,410
You want to try it?

26
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:28,087
"So Billy began."

27
00:04:28,256 --> 00:04:30,332
"He looked in the mirror,
and he said..."

28
00:04:30,508 --> 00:04:32,002
Candyman...

29
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:35,219
Candyman...

30
00:04:37,432 --> 00:04:38,927
Candyman...

31
00:04:41,102 --> 00:04:42,645
Candyman...

32
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:51,487
No one ever
got past four.

33
00:04:53,822 --> 00:04:55,365
Not here.

34
00:04:56,242 --> 00:04:59,944
Go downstairs.
I have a surprise for you.

35
00:05:08,296 --> 00:05:10,373
"She looked in the mirror..

36
00:05:10,549 --> 00:05:12,458
and I don't know why..

37
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:14,793
but she said his name
the last time."

38
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,594
Candyman.

39
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:18,927
"She turned out the lights..."

40
00:05:22,603 --> 00:05:25,519
...and what he saw turned
his hair white from shock.

41
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,304
Killed her.

42
00:05:28,442 --> 00:05:30,268
Split her open with his hook

43
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,483
and then killed the baby too.

44
00:05:32,654 --> 00:05:34,777
And Billy got away

45
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:37,907
but soon after,
he went crazy.

46
00:05:39,286 --> 00:05:43,283
My... my roommate's
boyfriend knows him.

47
00:05:49,296 --> 00:05:51,752
So when did you first hear this story?

48
00:05:51,924 --> 00:05:53,632
My friend heard it on the radio.

49
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:54,963
It's true. Sick, huh?

50
00:05:55,135 --> 00:05:58,136
The baby-sitter just roasted the kid
like it was a turkey or something.

51
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,634
So, what's the deal?

52
00:06:02,017 --> 00:06:04,804
You guys doing a page
on serial killers?

53
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:06,805
Something like that.

54
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:08,771
Well, that's it.
We're done.

55
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,645
- Thanks.
- No problem.

56
00:06:11,818 --> 00:06:14,025
See you.

57
00:06:14,196 --> 00:06:15,654
See you.

58
00:06:16,073 --> 00:06:17,781
See you.

59
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:22,280
Seems like they're getting
younger every day.

60
00:06:25,374 --> 00:06:29,208
Does anybody remember
the craze for the pet baby alligators?

61
00:06:29,338 --> 00:06:33,286
When they got too large to keep
people flushed them down the toilet.

62
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:37,083
They live in the sewers.
Some or them are 30 feet long.

63
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,298
- Where did this happen?
- In Miami.

64
00:06:40,472 --> 00:06:43,425
They went blind and albino
from living in the dark.

65
00:06:44,768 --> 00:06:48,433
It wasn't Miami. It was New York.
I read it in the paper.

66
00:06:48,938 --> 00:06:50,482
Then it must be true.

67
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:54,226
Why would Danny and Diane

68
00:06:54,362 --> 00:06:57,362
both be suffering
from the same delusion

69
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,277
in two cities
over 1,000 miles apart?

70
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,949
Let's face it, folks.

71
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:06,865
There are no alligators in the sewers.

72
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:12,166
No, it's... it's round the campfire.
It's bedtime stories.

73
00:07:12,588 --> 00:07:17,381
See, these stories are...
modern oral folklore.

74
00:07:17,552 --> 00:07:22,177
They are the un-self-conscious reflection
of the fears of urban society.

75
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:25,510
That's lunch.

76
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:47,039
Like the primordial reptile
it's formed into a monster. Why?

77
00:07:49,874 --> 00:07:51,618
Ouch! Oh...

78
00:07:52,628 --> 00:07:56,757
- The dashing professor.
- The lovely wife.

79
00:07:57,425 --> 00:07:59,133
Helen, you
know everybody?

80
00:07:59,302 --> 00:08:03,881
Crème de la crème...
Harold, Diane, Danny, Stacey.

81
00:08:04,015 --> 00:08:06,387
- Hi.
- Hello.

82
00:08:06,642 --> 00:08:10,094
So, keep up the good work.
Thank you for your contributions.

83
00:08:10,272 --> 00:08:11,764
- Thanks. Bye.
- Awesome lecture.

84
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,264
Bye.

85
00:08:19,782 --> 00:08:20,777
See ya.

86
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,154
So, you want to tell me
about this girl?

87
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,738
What's her name? Stacey.

88
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:33,165
She could barely look me
in the eyes, Trevor

89
00:08:33,336 --> 00:08:35,127
and she was blushing.

90
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:39,162
Well, I guess it's because
she's madly in love with me.

91
00:08:39,341 --> 00:08:42,427
All those bursting
adolescent hormones.

92
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:47,095
- You don't really think...
- No, of course not.

93
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:49,260
Good. I should hope not.

94
00:08:49,436 --> 00:08:52,602
So, what's the matter?

95
00:08:52,814 --> 00:08:55,305
Trevor, you promised
you wouldn't do

96
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:58,015
the urban legends lecture
until next semester.

97
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:01,444
You knew Bernadette and I
were gathering data.

98
00:09:01,614 --> 00:09:03,488
Why did you have to ruin it?

99
00:09:03,658 --> 00:09:07,192
I love you dearly
but I can't hold up their education

100
00:09:07,328 --> 00:09:10,330
while the two of you
complete your thesis.

101
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:11,826
I have a curriculum
to follow here.

102
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,280
Yes, I know.

103
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,868
Well... so don't
be mad at me.

104
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:24,334
"If you look in the mirror
and say his name five times..

105
00:09:24,471 --> 00:09:27,258
he'll appear behind you,
breathing down your neck."

106
00:09:36,608 --> 00:09:38,352
Can I clean your room?

107
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:40,150
Oh, sure. Don't mind me.

108
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:41,695
"So Billy began."

109
00:09:42,321 --> 00:09:43,485
"He looked in the mirror..

110
00:09:43,657 --> 00:09:47,785
and he said": "Candyman,
Candyman, Candyman... "

111
00:09:50,872 --> 00:09:52,034
Candyman, huh?

112
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,748
Yes. Have you heard of him?

113
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:59,330
- You doing a study on him?
- Yes, I am.

114
00:09:59,506 --> 00:10:00,835
What have you heard?

115
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:04,669
Everybody scared of him
once it get dark.

116
00:10:04,844 --> 00:10:07,762
He live over at Cabrini.
My friend told me about him.

117
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:09,088
Cabrini Green?

118
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:10,547
Yeah, in the Projects.

119
00:10:10,727 --> 00:10:14,261
I live on the South Side
so I don't know much about it.

120
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:17,515
But my friend know all about it.
Her cousin live at Cabrini.

121
00:10:17,774 --> 00:10:19,600
They say he killed a lady.

122
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:21,228
Can I talk to your friend?

123
00:10:21,444 --> 00:10:22,725
Sure.

124
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:29,441
Kitty?

125
00:10:29,619 --> 00:10:33,453
- Yeah, what do you want?
- Lady down here want to talk to you.

126
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:34,869
All right.

127
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,496
She coming.

128
00:10:43,091 --> 00:10:44,290
I'm Helen Lyle.

129
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:46,793
Pleased to meet you.
Henrietta Mosely.

130
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,595
And this is Kitty Culver.

131
00:10:48,764 --> 00:10:51,634
Tell her what you told me
about the Candyman.

132
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:57,355
All I know is there was some lady in a tub,
and she heard a noise.

133
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,231
Do you remember her name?

134
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,808
Her name was Ruthie Jean.

135
00:11:01,986 --> 00:11:06,113
She heard banging and smashing like
somebody was making a hole in the wall.

136
00:11:06,282 --> 00:11:08,736
So Ruthie called 911.

137
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:10,860
She said, "Somebody is coming
through the wall. "

138
00:11:11,077 --> 00:11:13,070
And they didn't believe her.

139
00:11:13,247 --> 00:11:15,322
They thought the lady
was crazy, right?

140
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:19,118
So she called 911 again
and they still didn't believe her.

141
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:23,001
When they finally got
there, she was dead.

142
00:11:23,175 --> 00:11:24,503
Was she shot?

143
00:11:25,468 --> 00:11:27,508
No.

144
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:31,011
She was killed with a hook. Schhht!

145
00:11:33,016 --> 00:11:34,392
It's true.

146
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,516
Yeah, I read it in the papers.

147
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:40,057
Candyman killed her.

148
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,228
Yeah, but...

149
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:44,235
I don't know nothing about that.

150
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:44,874
Helen, this is sick.

151
00:12:45,006 --> 00:12:47,675
This isn't one of your fairy tales.
The woman got killed here.

152
00:12:49,593 --> 00:12:51,337
That's not the half of it.

153
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,546
That's Cabrini Green
not that you'd recognise it today.

154
00:12:56,684 --> 00:12:57,930
Yeah, no kidding.

155
00:12:58,061 --> 00:12:59,934
I won't even drive
past there.

156
00:13:00,062 --> 00:13:03,764
- A kid got shot there the other day.
- Everyday.

157
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:07,109
OK, now look carefully
at this picture

158
00:13:07,237 --> 00:13:08,863
and then this one.

159
00:13:15,245 --> 00:13:17,118
You spot it?

160
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:18,825
No.

161
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,157
That's not Cabrini Green.

162
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:24,500
That's this building,
Lincoln village.

163
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,121
My apartment was built
as a housing project.

164
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,587
No.

165
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:30,840
Yeah.

166
00:13:31,053 --> 00:13:33,211
Now take a look at this.

167
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,978
Once finished the city realised
there was no barrier

168
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:48,060
between here and the Gold Coast.

169
00:13:48,236 --> 00:13:50,442
Unlike over there
where the highway

170
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,105
and the el train
keep the ghetto cut off.

171
00:13:53,243 --> 00:13:55,365
So they made some
minor alterations.

172
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:58,074
They covered the cinder block
in plaster

173
00:13:58,248 --> 00:13:59,906
and sold the lot off
as condos.

174
00:14:00,498 --> 00:14:02,740
How much did you pay
for this place?

175
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:03,955
Don't ask.

176
00:14:06,962 --> 00:14:09,121
Now, wait till you see this.

177
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:13,010
Here's the proof.

178
00:14:17,808 --> 00:14:19,967
The killer, or killers...

179
00:14:20,102 --> 00:14:21,597
they don't know which...

180
00:14:21,771 --> 00:14:25,103
smashed their way through
the back of this cabinet.

181
00:14:25,273 --> 00:14:26,982
See? There's no wall there.

182
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,059
There's only a medicine chest

183
00:14:29,152 --> 00:14:31,228
separating us from
the other apartment.

184
00:14:32,448 --> 00:14:35,318
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
There could be somebody on the toilet.

185
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:38,529
- No, the apartment is vacant.
- Are you sure?

186
00:14:40,538 --> 00:14:41,488
There.

187
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:43,041
OK, now take a look.

188
00:14:47,713 --> 00:14:50,250
That is amazing.

189
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:53,175
- What?
- There's somebody there. I saw a light.

190
00:14:53,343 --> 00:14:54,588
There's nobody there.

191
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,668
Psych.

192
00:14:55,845 --> 00:14:57,423
That's not funny.

193
00:15:00,768 --> 00:15:04,219
- You didn't scare me at all.
- Yeah, right.

194
00:15:06,816 --> 00:15:08,191
Ow.

195
00:15:09,068 --> 00:15:11,524
You don't believe
all that nonsense, do you?

196
00:15:11,905 --> 00:15:13,811
I don't. Do you?

197
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:15,062
No.

198
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:18,731
All right.

199
00:15:19,536 --> 00:15:24,910
Candyman, Candyman,
Candyman, Candyman...

200
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,756
...Candyman.

201
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:33,374
Oh, you chicken!

202
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:35,501
You have to do it five times.
Come on.

203
00:15:35,678 --> 00:15:39,177
- I did it.
- Better safe than sorry.

204
00:15:59,368 --> 00:16:01,076
Trevor?

205
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:10,753
No, no!

206
00:16:10,921 --> 00:16:12,749
What's the matter?

207
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:14,708
Oh, Trevor!

208
00:16:14,883 --> 00:16:16,711
Who were you expecting?

209
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:19,720
What time is it?

210
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:23,590
It's late and I'm smashed.

211
00:16:23,768 --> 00:16:25,595
Sorry I scared you.

212
00:16:59,554 --> 00:17:01,382
What's with the arsenal,
Bernadette?

213
00:17:01,723 --> 00:17:02,838
We're only going eight blocks.

214
00:17:02,974 --> 00:17:05,761
You're the one who got us
dressed up like cops.

215
00:17:05,893 --> 00:17:07,767
I just said dress conservatively.

216
00:17:07,937 --> 00:17:08,968
We look like cops.

217
00:17:10,022 --> 00:17:11,897
Why are you trying to scare me?

218
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:14,309
I'm not trying to scare you.
I just want you to think.

219
00:17:14,444 --> 00:17:16,521
The gangs hold
this neighbourhood hostage.

220
00:17:20,032 --> 00:17:21,906
OK, let's just turn around then.

221
00:17:22,076 --> 00:17:24,781
Let's just go back
and we can write a boring thesis

222
00:17:24,954 --> 00:17:27,492
regurgitating the usual crap
on urban legend.

223
00:17:32,796 --> 00:17:35,169
We've got a real shot here,
Bernadette.

224
00:17:36,008 --> 00:17:37,039
An entire community

225
00:17:37,217 --> 00:17:41,215
starts attributing the daily horrors
of their lives to a mythical figure.

226
00:17:41,346 --> 00:17:45,675
Now, if Trevor and Archie were in on this
do you think they'd chicken out?

227
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,392
In a second.

228
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,885
Exactly.

229
00:17:50,062 --> 00:17:51,687
All right.

230
00:18:35,524 --> 00:18:38,810
- You want to wait here for me?
- No.

231
00:18:39,946 --> 00:18:41,193
Well, let's go.

232
00:18:46,996 --> 00:18:49,238
And lock the car.

233
00:18:52,961 --> 00:18:54,336
Hey now.

234
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:57,079
Want something, baby?

235
00:18:57,255 --> 00:18:59,128
I got it for you.

236
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,637
Yo, baby...

237
00:19:04,388 --> 00:19:05,763
Which way you going?

238
00:19:06,556 --> 00:19:09,013
Just going inside.

239
00:19:09,185 --> 00:19:10,180
Yeah?

240
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:12,392
Hey, come up in here.

241
00:19:12,563 --> 00:19:14,389
Who you looking for?

242
00:19:14,566 --> 00:19:16,059
A friend of ours.

243
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:18,024
Sure you not the police?

244
00:19:18,528 --> 00:19:20,437
Look like five-oh to me.

245
00:19:20,613 --> 00:19:23,446
Ask blondie where she going.

246
00:19:23,614 --> 00:19:25,656
Who you going to see?

247
00:19:25,827 --> 00:19:29,741
Let's take the stairs.
Come on.

248
00:19:35,377 --> 00:19:36,706
Hands up, people!

249
00:19:36,879 --> 00:19:39,548
Five-oh coming up
the back door.

250
00:19:39,714 --> 00:19:41,791
It's OK
they think we're cops.

251
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:44,796
They're not going to follow us.

252
00:19:50,642 --> 00:19:52,137
Hang on.

253
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:16,288
Look at this.

254
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:17,960
This is great.

255
00:20:19,129 --> 00:20:22,047
# Sweets to... #

256
00:20:22,258 --> 00:20:25,294
# ... to the sweet. #

257
00:20:25,469 --> 00:20:27,379
# Sweets to the sweet. #

258
00:20:28,597 --> 00:20:30,389
Hurry up, Helen.

259
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,759
Let me just get the door.

260
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:41,312
Sorry.

261
00:20:41,444 --> 00:20:42,689
Jesus, Helen.

262
00:20:45,823 --> 00:20:47,899
- Here it is.
- Don't go in there.

263
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:49,492
Come on.

264
00:20:52,162 --> 00:20:53,242
Come on.

265
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:58,790
Jesus, it stinks.

266
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,298
See, I was right.

267
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:10,386
The layout is identical

268
00:21:10,556 --> 00:21:13,474
which means the bathroom
is over there.

269
00:21:13,642 --> 00:21:15,802
- Helen...
- What's the problem?

270
00:21:15,938 --> 00:21:18,939
A woman died in there.
Leave it.

271
00:21:26,573 --> 00:21:29,526
It's all right.
There's nothing to see.

272
00:21:38,836 --> 00:21:40,294
Wait a minute.

273
00:21:40,504 --> 00:21:42,793
This is where he crawled
through, right?

274
00:21:42,965 --> 00:21:44,792
Yeah.

275
00:21:49,931 --> 00:21:51,886
Well, we found it.
Let's go.

276
00:21:52,014 --> 00:21:53,129
Wait a second.

277
00:21:58,062 --> 00:21:59,889
OK, hang onto this.

278
00:22:02,192 --> 00:22:03,140
What?

279
00:22:03,318 --> 00:22:05,062
I'm just going to go through

280
00:22:05,153 --> 00:22:07,230
and when I get back,
we're out of here.

281
00:22:07,406 --> 00:22:09,113
You've got to be kidding.

282
00:22:09,282 --> 00:22:10,907
It's just a derelict apartment.

283
00:22:11,076 --> 00:22:13,152
What if somebody's
packing drugs in there?

284
00:22:13,287 --> 00:22:15,243
You just going to apologise
and give them your card?

285
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:18,998
All right, let's listen.

286
00:22:24,548 --> 00:22:26,956
There's nobody in there.

287
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:29,881
OK, but hurry up.

288
00:22:30,054 --> 00:22:31,927
Be careful.

289
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:43,016
Give me the camera.

290
00:22:43,148 --> 00:22:45,059
You've got five minutes.

291
00:22:45,193 --> 00:22:46,937
OK, five.

292
00:23:47,757 --> 00:23:49,583
Dammit.

293
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:51,934
Bernadette...

294
00:24:53,406 --> 00:24:55,232
I ran out of film. I've got to back.

295
00:24:55,407 --> 00:24:57,400
- No way.
- You can't believe...

296
00:24:57,577 --> 00:24:59,570
No way, Helen.
We're out of here.

297
00:25:08,755 --> 00:25:11,161
What you all doing in there?

298
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,747
We're just leaving.

299
00:25:13,884 --> 00:25:16,458
You here for the sweep?

300
00:25:16,595 --> 00:25:18,006
No. We're not cops.

301
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,889
We're from the university.

302
00:25:20,058 --> 00:25:22,300
Well, you don't
belong here, lady...

303
00:25:22,435 --> 00:25:25,306
going through
people's apartments and things.

304
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,150
I'm Helen Lyle
and this is Bernadette Walsh.

305
00:25:28,316 --> 00:25:29,514
We're doing a thesis

306
00:25:29,692 --> 00:25:32,730
and were wondering if we could
talk to you for a few minutes.

307
00:25:33,405 --> 00:25:35,647
Here, this is my card.

308
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,115
My baby.

309
00:25:41,287 --> 00:25:42,996
Come on.

310
00:25:43,123 --> 00:25:44,830
Come on, let's go.

311
00:25:49,212 --> 00:25:52,961
You know, whites don't never come
here except to cause us a problem.

312
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:55,540
Believe me that's not what we want to do.

313
00:26:00,931 --> 00:26:02,176
Let's go in.

314
00:26:12,528 --> 00:26:15,197
So you say you're doing a study?

315
00:26:15,364 --> 00:26:17,238
What you gonna say?

316
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:19,898
That we bad?

317
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,071
We steal?

318
00:26:22,204 --> 00:26:23,911
We gang-bang?

319
00:26:24,705 --> 00:26:27,031
We all on drugs, right?

320
00:26:28,001 --> 00:26:30,871
We ain't all like them
assholes downstairs, you know?

321
00:26:31,963 --> 00:26:34,633
I just want to raise my child good.

322
00:26:35,175 --> 00:26:36,883
He's a beautiful little boy.

323
00:26:37,052 --> 00:26:39,508
And he's all I got.

324
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,380
- What's his name?
- Anthony.

325
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:47,097
I'm Anne-Marie.

326
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,727
Anne-Marie McCoy.

327
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,979
Nice to meet you.

328
00:26:53,152 --> 00:26:54,610
Sorry we disturbed you.

329
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,943
We'll just get out of your way.

330
00:26:57,447 --> 00:26:58,442
It's OK.

331
00:26:58,614 --> 00:27:00,857
I mean, I don't mean
to be rude, and it's...

332
00:27:01,034 --> 00:27:02,149
you know, it's just...

333
00:27:02,327 --> 00:27:04,533
the white folks
that come around here

334
00:27:04,704 --> 00:27:07,196
ain't too hand-shaking
with us, you know?

335
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:11,914
- Hey, what you doing?
- Let me help you.

336
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,665
You making
a mess here?

337
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,880
Thank you.

338
00:27:18,093 --> 00:27:19,884
Thanks.

339
00:27:20,053 --> 00:27:21,216
You got kids?

340
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,423
No, but I'd love one.

341
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:25,093
Hey.

342
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,841
Got my eye on this one big time.

343
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,052
Yeah.

344
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,056
They're not going to get him.

345
00:27:40,907 --> 00:27:43,399
You want to know
about Ruthie Jean?

346
00:27:44,995 --> 00:27:46,786
They all been here,
you know.

347
00:27:47,372 --> 00:27:51,157
Newspapers, cops,
case workers...

348
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:53,825
They all want to know.

349
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,590
I heard her screaming.

350
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,045
I heard right through the walls.

351
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,512
I dialled 911.

352
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,511
Nobody came.

353
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,593
Nobody came.

354
00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:12,680
Everybody scared.

355
00:28:12,856 --> 00:28:13,935
He could come

356
00:28:14,107 --> 00:28:16,396
right through these walls,
you know?

357
00:28:16,568 --> 00:28:18,361
I'm scared.

358
00:28:20,781 --> 00:28:24,566
Scared for my child.

359
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,985
They ain't never gonna catch him.

360
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:30,413
- Who?
- Candyman.

361
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:40,919
If they asked for something, if they
saw something they liked, and you point...

362
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:44,011
They thought
it was rude to point.

363
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,514
So what did
they do?

364
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,547
Spat over people.

365
00:28:48,684 --> 00:28:50,476
It was quite extraordinary.

366
00:28:51,103 --> 00:28:53,226
- Be nice.
- I am being nice.

367
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:57,941
So, how are the two most beautiful
graduate students getting along?

368
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:02,698
Trevor tells me you've been
dabbling in my favourite subject.

369
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:09,071
I can't wait to review your data.
I can fit you in tomorrow morning.

370
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,527
We're not ready yet.

371
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,786
That's precisely the moment

372
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,794
in which I can be
of greatest assistance

373
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:20,545
before you disappear down
a path to academic Bolivia.

374
00:29:20,883 --> 00:29:23,457
I've been there.

375
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:26,507
Actually, Purcell,
we're about to bury you.

376
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,590
- Helen...
- What?

377
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,686
We'll have something
in a week or so.

378
00:29:33,854 --> 00:29:36,477
It's just that we only
went to Cabrini today...

379
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:39,983
Ah! Cabrini Green?

380
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,434
Candyman country.

381
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,483
Well, if you're after
the hook man, Helen,

382
00:29:44,656 --> 00:29:48,525
you must read the paper
I wrote about him ten years ago.

383
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:51,200
You do know the story,
don't you?

384
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:52,915
No.

385
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,792
Then how are you going
to bury me?

386
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:10,890
The legend first appeared
in 1890.

387
00:30:12,351 --> 00:30:14,843
Candyman was
the son of a slave.

388
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,599
His father had amassed
a considerable fortune

389
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,644
from designing a device

390
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:25,990
for the mass producing of shoes
after the civil war.

391
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:29,407
Candyman had been sent
to all the best schools

392
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:31,702
and had grown up
in polite society.

393
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:36,667
He had a prodigious talent
as an artist

394
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,077
and was much sought after

395
00:30:40,254 --> 00:30:42,330
when it came to
the documenting

396
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:46,920
of one's wealth and position
in society in a portrait.

397
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:50,049
Well, it was in this
latter capacity

398
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:54,222
that he was commissioned
by a wealthy landowner

399
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:57,978
to capture his daughter's
virginal beauty.

400
00:30:58,107 --> 00:31:01,273
Well, of course,
they fell deeply in love

401
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,188
and she became pregnant.

402
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:11,691
Poor Candyman.

403
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,493
Her father executed
a terrible revenge.

404
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,836
He paid a pack of
brutal hooligans to do the deed.

405
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:27,840
They chased Candyman
through the town to Cabrini Green

406
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:32,009
where they proceeded
to saw off his right hand

407
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,009
with a rusty blade.

408
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:37,435
No one came to his aid.

409
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:41,431
But this was just the beginning
of his ordeal.

410
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:45,061
Nearby there was
an apiary.

411
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:48,274
Dozens of hives,
filled with hungry bees.

412
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:54,781
They smashed the hives
and stole the honeycomb

413
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:58,038
and smeared it over
his prone, naked body.

414
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:03,621
Candyman was stung
to death by the bees.

415
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:08,669
They burned his body
on a giant pyre

416
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:11,377
then scattered his ashes
over Cabrini Green.

417
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:27,066
Hello.

418
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:32,867
Anne-Marie ain't in.

419
00:32:34,412 --> 00:32:35,822
Are you sure?

420
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,908
Yeah. She said you'd be back.

421
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:49,214
What's your name?

422
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:50,507
Jake.

423
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,890
Listen, Jake, maybe
you can help me out.

424
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:59,178
I wanted to find out about
that woman who got killed.

425
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:01,145
Do you know
anything about that?

426
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:03,886
Her name was Ruthie Jean.

427
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,105
I don't know nothing.

428
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:09,024
Did anybody else talk about it?

429
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:17,237
You know, it's OK
to talk to me, Jake...

430
00:33:19,207 --> 00:33:21,282
because I'm not a cop

431
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:24,294
so nobody's going
to get in trouble.

432
00:33:24,462 --> 00:33:26,620
I can't say nothing

433
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:29,420
or Candyman will get me.

434
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:31,331
Candyman?

435
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:34,931
You scared of him?

436
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:37,968
I ain't scared of nobody

437
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,102
but you're crazy
walking here on your own.

438
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:43,220
It ain't safe around here.

439
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:45,188
Yeah, I know.

440
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:51,026
But I don't scare
too easy either, Jake.

441
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:55,617
You know,
you don't have to tell me.

442
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:58,032
You could just show me.

443
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:01,620
And if you show me
where Candyman is

444
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:03,618
I'll make you a promise.

445
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:07,160
It will be our secret.

446
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:13,878
Unless you're too scared.

447
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:27,102
Somebody building
a bonfire?

448
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:29,850
Yeah, for the party.

449
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:48,670
In there.

450
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:50,666
Candyman's in there?

451
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:52,839
My friend Charlie say so.

452
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:55,334
A boy got killed there.

453
00:34:58,932 --> 00:35:00,806
- Who was he?
- Ain't sure.

454
00:35:00,975 --> 00:35:03,099
Charlie tell me he was weird.

455
00:35:03,396 --> 00:35:05,304
He was crazy?

456
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,390
No, a retard.

457
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:10,442
His mom was in the store...

458
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:14,739
and the boy, he need to go,
you know, to the bathroom.

459
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:17,734
His mom was
taking her time

460
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:19,487
choosing this,
looking at that

461
00:35:19,662 --> 00:35:22,117
so the boy start moaning.

462
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:24,163
His mom get mad at him

463
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:26,125
send him across the street.

464
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,126
His mom is at the checkout.

465
00:35:28,295 --> 00:35:29,541
She hears her boy screaming.

466
00:35:29,714 --> 00:35:31,374
Mommy!

467
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,712
Mommy!

468
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:35,130
There's a big tough guy.

469
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:37,169
He runs over to check it out.

470
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:41,806
He come out of there
shaking and crying.

471
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:44,389
He only been in there five seconds.

472
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:48,809
Come out of there
and his hair turned white.

473
00:35:49,858 --> 00:35:52,812
I mean, it turned white
just like that.

474
00:35:52,987 --> 00:35:54,565
Was the boy murdered?

475
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,943
Worse.

476
00:35:56,115 --> 00:36:00,194
He's lying on the floor
in a pool of blood holding himself.

477
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:04,575
Mommy! Mommy!

478
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:08,741
They found it floating
in the toilet.

479
00:36:08,962 --> 00:36:10,207
Can't fix that.

480
00:36:10,422 --> 00:36:11,796
Better off dead.

481
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:14,918
Did Candyman do this?

482
00:36:20,556 --> 00:36:24,089
Listen, you wait here for me, OK?

483
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:25,430
OK.

484
00:36:43,246 --> 00:36:44,526
Hello?

485
00:38:00,867 --> 00:38:02,904
Candyman.

486
00:38:20,635 --> 00:38:22,675
Oh, excuse me.
I'm done here.

487
00:38:22,846 --> 00:38:24,922
I'll just get out of your way.

488
00:38:31,145 --> 00:38:34,349
Listen, I don't want
to interfere with your business.

489
00:38:34,524 --> 00:38:36,315
I'm not a cop.

490
00:38:36,484 --> 00:38:39,106
I'm from the University of Illinois.

491
00:38:41,781 --> 00:38:43,691
I'll just get out of your way.

492
00:38:44,784 --> 00:38:45,781
Come on!

493
00:38:45,953 --> 00:38:47,281
Let me go!

494
00:38:47,454 --> 00:38:48,698
You're not being very smart.

495
00:38:48,872 --> 00:38:50,496
My colleagues know where I am

496
00:38:50,665 --> 00:38:52,159
and they're expecting me back.

497
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:53,531
Now let me go!

498
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:59,583
I hear you looking
for Candyman, bitch.

499
00:39:01,385 --> 00:39:03,294
Well, you found him.

500
00:39:19,777 --> 00:39:22,980
We hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

501
00:39:23,156 --> 00:39:24,865
Step back.

502
00:39:27,703 --> 00:39:28,734
Number four

503
00:39:28,829 --> 00:39:30,905
step forward
and say the line.

504
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,957
We hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

505
00:39:34,043 --> 00:39:35,241
Step back.

506
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,162
Number five

507
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,132
step forward
and say the line.

508
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,837
We hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

509
00:39:43,968 --> 00:39:45,131
Step back.

510
00:39:45,304 --> 00:39:46,419
Take 'em out.

511
00:39:57,983 --> 00:39:59,892
It's number five.

512
00:40:00,026 --> 00:40:01,355
Good work.

513
00:40:05,866 --> 00:40:07,407
How d'you catch him?

514
00:40:07,534 --> 00:40:09,077
We swept the place.

515
00:40:09,203 --> 00:40:11,574
We start from the top floor
and work our way down.

516
00:40:11,705 --> 00:40:13,745
That way you can
flush 'em all out.

517
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:16,158
Whole of Cabrini
is locked down now.

518
00:40:16,293 --> 00:40:18,784
You're very lucky to be alive,
Ms Lyle.

519
00:40:22,216 --> 00:40:24,008
Did he kill Ruthie Jean?

520
00:40:24,176 --> 00:40:25,292
No question.

521
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,296
Killed that poor kid as well.

522
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:30,051
He ran the overlords.

523
00:40:30,224 --> 00:40:32,263
We knew everything about him.

524
00:40:32,434 --> 00:40:34,806
Only reason why we didn't
bring him in before

525
00:40:34,937 --> 00:40:37,060
because we couldn't find
anyone to testify.

526
00:40:37,231 --> 00:40:40,018
We can't protect them
down at Cabrini Green

527
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:42,683
and they knew that.

528
00:40:42,862 --> 00:40:44,984
What about
the little boy... Jake?

529
00:40:45,155 --> 00:40:46,982
We don't need him.

530
00:40:47,157 --> 00:40:48,818
We have you.

531
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:56,500
Hey, Jake.

532
00:41:03,382 --> 00:41:06,134
I just wanted
to thank you for saving my life.

533
00:41:06,302 --> 00:41:08,093
I wanna go home.

534
00:41:08,262 --> 00:41:09,970
We'll get you out of here.

535
00:41:10,097 --> 00:41:11,757
You did good.

536
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:14,762
You said it was our secret.
You lied!

537
00:41:14,936 --> 00:41:16,976
It still is, Jake.

538
00:41:17,146 --> 00:41:18,261
You won't have
to go to court.

539
00:41:21,567 --> 00:41:24,022
Candyman will get me.

540
00:41:24,152 --> 00:41:27,356
Candyman isn't real.

541
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,898
He's just a story.

542
00:41:30,117 --> 00:41:31,232
You know, like Dracula

543
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:33,237
or... or Frankenstein.

544
00:41:34,788 --> 00:41:38,740
A bad man took his name
so he could scare us.

545
00:41:38,919 --> 00:41:41,327
But now he's locked up
everything's going to be OK.

546
00:41:41,505 --> 00:41:44,671
Candyman ain't real?

547
00:41:45,716 --> 00:41:46,795
No.

548
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,512
Hey there!

549
00:41:55,684 --> 00:41:56,846
Whoa. Slow down.

550
00:41:57,185 --> 00:41:58,847
You're supposed
to be the invalid here.

551
00:41:59,022 --> 00:42:01,062
Look, see?
It's much better today.

552
00:42:01,233 --> 00:42:02,430
Yeah, it looks great.

553
00:42:02,609 --> 00:42:03,772
Come sit down.

554
00:42:18,999 --> 00:42:20,827
You haven't eaten already?

555
00:42:21,044 --> 00:42:23,036
No, of course not.

556
00:42:23,171 --> 00:42:24,997
OK, good.

557
00:42:42,983 --> 00:42:44,394
Hey!

558
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:46,104
Welcome back.

559
00:42:46,278 --> 00:42:47,309
Thanks.

560
00:42:47,445 --> 00:42:48,608
Let me see.

561
00:42:49,991 --> 00:42:52,611
I'm so glad you're OK.

562
00:42:52,784 --> 00:42:55,656
But you know what bugs me
about the whole thing?

563
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:59,079
Two people get brutally murdered
and the cops do nothing.

564
00:42:59,249 --> 00:43:02,699
A white woman gets attacked
and they lock the place down.

565
00:43:02,876 --> 00:43:04,585
This was a bad guy.

566
00:43:04,753 --> 00:43:07,328
You got him put away.
That's what matters.

567
00:43:07,466 --> 00:43:10,217
Oh! I've got
a surprise for you.

568
00:43:10,385 --> 00:43:11,631
What?

569
00:43:11,804 --> 00:43:14,341
You're not going to believe it.

570
00:43:14,514 --> 00:43:15,594
The pictures.

571
00:43:15,766 --> 00:43:17,889
My friend in
the photography department

572
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,719
managed to save most of them.

573
00:43:19,853 --> 00:43:21,016
I'd written them off.

574
00:43:21,188 --> 00:43:22,468
The camera was smashed.

575
00:43:23,941 --> 00:43:26,015
I've been talking
to some publishers

576
00:43:26,191 --> 00:43:27,936
and there's a lot of interest

577
00:43:28,111 --> 00:43:30,400
since you made the local section.

578
00:43:30,572 --> 00:43:32,316
We're going to be published.

579
00:43:32,867 --> 00:43:35,108
I'll come over
tomorrow at 9:00.

580
00:43:35,285 --> 00:43:37,324
- We'll get started?
- Yeah.

581
00:44:17,994 --> 00:44:19,868
Helen...

582
00:44:21,622 --> 00:44:23,201
Yes?

583
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:26,038
Helen...

584
00:44:32,717 --> 00:44:34,379
Who is that?

585
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,925
Who is that?

586
00:44:42,186 --> 00:44:43,845
Helen...

587
00:44:44,021 --> 00:44:46,809
I came for you.

588
00:45:06,752 --> 00:45:08,460
Do I know you?

589
00:45:08,671 --> 00:45:11,671
No... no...

590
00:45:11,799 --> 00:45:13,958
but you doubted me.

591
00:45:14,218 --> 00:45:15,498
I'm sorry.

592
00:45:15,594 --> 00:45:16,874
I have to go.

593
00:45:17,053 --> 00:45:19,547
No need to leave yet.

594
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,558
But I'm late.

595
00:45:26,772 --> 00:45:31,149
You were not content
with the stories

596
00:45:31,318 --> 00:45:33,524
so I was obliged to come.

597
00:45:38,491 --> 00:45:41,613
Be my victim.

598
00:45:45,584 --> 00:45:47,956
Be my victim.

599
00:45:50,129 --> 00:45:54,080
I am the writing on the wall

600
00:45:54,301 --> 00:45:57,301
the whisper in the classroom.

601
00:45:57,470 --> 00:46:00,969
Without these things
I am nothing

602
00:46:01,181 --> 00:46:04,847
so now I must shed
innocent blood.

603
00:46:05,019 --> 00:46:06,299
Come with me.

604
00:46:19,742 --> 00:46:22,197
No!

605
00:46:37,553 --> 00:46:39,793
Anthony!

606
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:41,880
Anthony!

607
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:47,181
No! No! No!

608
00:46:47,311 --> 00:46:49,600
No, Anthony!

609
00:46:49,814 --> 00:46:52,222
Anthony!

610
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:01,398
Anthony!

611
00:47:01,951 --> 00:47:03,446
Anne-Marie?

612
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:04,819
No! You did it!

613
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:06,781
You! You did it!

614
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:08,237
You murdered my baby!

615
00:47:12,504 --> 00:47:13,999
You murderer!

616
00:47:14,548 --> 00:47:16,872
No! No!

617
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:18,378
Stop! Please, stop!

618
00:47:24,557 --> 00:47:25,720
Now stop!

619
00:47:25,892 --> 00:47:27,351
Stop!

620
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:29,226
Police! Open up!

621
00:47:29,354 --> 00:47:31,263
All right,
hold it right there!

622
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,472
Back away! Now!

623
00:47:34,567 --> 00:47:35,646
Look out!

624
00:47:54,672 --> 00:47:55,952
Remove your sweater.

625
00:48:02,929 --> 00:48:05,337
Drop it and slide it over to me.

626
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,351
Take off your brassiere.

627
00:48:12,773 --> 00:48:16,142
Can I please take a shower?

628
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,193
Oh...

629
00:48:19,238 --> 00:48:20,982
Oh, God...

630
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:25,488
Drop it,
slide it over to me.

631
00:48:29,665 --> 00:48:30,908
Lift up your arms.

632
00:48:33,502 --> 00:48:36,253
Lift your left breast.

633
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,452
Your right.

634
00:48:42,762 --> 00:48:44,090
Remove your underwear.

635
00:48:44,263 --> 00:48:48,427
Can I please speak
with detective Valento?

636
00:48:48,518 --> 00:48:50,510
Remove your underwear.

637
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:55,392
Frank.

638
00:49:03,074 --> 00:49:05,233
Ms Lyle, you're under arrest.

639
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:06,786
Do you understand?

640
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:13,622
Please let me explain.

641
00:49:13,793 --> 00:49:15,618
Do you understand?

642
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,415
Yes, but...

643
00:49:18,589 --> 00:49:19,751
You have the right

644
00:49:19,881 --> 00:49:21,506
to remain silent.

645
00:49:21,675 --> 00:49:23,420
Do you understand?

646
00:49:23,595 --> 00:49:26,263
This is crazy.
I was attacked.

647
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:27,889
Respond to the question.

648
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:32,684
I understand.

649
00:49:32,854 --> 00:49:35,310
At approximately 10:00 pm.

650
00:49:35,857 --> 00:49:39,059
Anne-Marie McCoy
returned to her apartment.

651
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:43,108
She discovered her dog
with its head cut off.

652
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,072
She cried for assistance

653
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:48,858
at which point you attacked her
with a meat cleaver.

654
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,955
You were still in possession
of this weapon

655
00:49:52,123 --> 00:49:55,823
when the arresting officers
came to her aid.

656
00:49:56,002 --> 00:49:59,584
Where's the baby?

657
00:49:59,713 --> 00:50:01,505
I... I don't know.

658
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:02,913
You're sick.

659
00:50:09,974 --> 00:50:12,548
Before I ask any
further questions

660
00:50:12,685 --> 00:50:14,809
would you like
to have counsel?

661
00:50:16,272 --> 00:50:18,598
Yes or no?

662
00:50:20,944 --> 00:50:22,983
I... I'd like to make a phone call.

663
00:50:37,377 --> 00:50:40,212
I'm sorry,
we can't take your call.

664
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:43,084
Please leave a message
after the tone.

665
00:50:44,467 --> 00:50:46,875
Trevor, are you there?
Pick up.

666
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:50,590
It's an emergency, Trevor.

667
00:50:50,766 --> 00:50:51,881
Pick up the phone.

668
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:54,763
I've been arrested.

669
00:50:54,978 --> 00:50:57,303
I'm at the 18th district.

670
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,895
Can you...
can you please come pick me up?

671
00:51:01,149 --> 00:51:03,724
That's it.

672
00:51:03,862 --> 00:51:07,562
Do you know what time it is?

673
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:10,575
3:00 am.

674
00:51:43,985 --> 00:51:46,939
Noooo!

675
00:51:47,113 --> 00:51:49,438
No!

676
00:51:55,496 --> 00:51:56,659
Oh, God.

677
00:51:57,958 --> 00:52:00,201
There's got to be
another way out.

678
00:52:00,378 --> 00:52:02,703
Cover her face.
Don't say anything.

679
00:52:03,631 --> 00:52:05,174
OK.

680
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,331
All right.

681
00:52:06,509 --> 00:52:08,548
You'll be fine.

682
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:14,091
Just keep your head down.

683
00:52:14,265 --> 00:52:15,890
It's going to be fine.

684
00:52:19,229 --> 00:52:21,602
All right, people,
back off, back off!

685
00:52:21,774 --> 00:52:22,972
We have no comment.

686
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:24,894
No comment.
Nothing to say.

687
00:52:25,111 --> 00:52:27,020
Do you know
the baby's whereabouts?

688
00:52:27,196 --> 00:52:28,738
My client has
not been charged

689
00:52:28,864 --> 00:52:29,943
with a thing!

690
00:52:30,116 --> 00:52:31,740
Information has indicated

691
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:35,074
that baby Anthony was abducted
and may still be alive.

692
00:52:35,328 --> 00:52:37,571
The blood may have come
from the dog.

693
00:52:37,748 --> 00:52:39,407
A suspect was released

694
00:52:39,583 --> 00:52:41,326
this morning after questioning

695
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,952
and I guess we'll just
have to follow this one...

696
00:52:45,881 --> 00:52:48,836
Well, at least they didn't
mention your name.

697
00:52:49,011 --> 00:52:50,420
That's good.

698
00:52:53,472 --> 00:52:56,841
Now, they haven't charged you,
because they think

699
00:52:56,975 --> 00:52:58,303
they'll find the body

700
00:52:58,476 --> 00:53:00,019
which means, I'm afraid

701
00:53:00,145 --> 00:53:02,018
they're shooting for murder one,

702
00:53:02,188 --> 00:53:04,264
but I don't think they have a chance.

703
00:53:07,861 --> 00:53:09,771
Do you think I did it?

704
00:53:09,906 --> 00:53:11,448
No. Nobody believes that.

705
00:53:13,325 --> 00:53:15,153
But it's crossed your mind?

706
00:53:19,957 --> 00:53:21,368
Is there anything,

707
00:53:21,459 --> 00:53:24,791
any detail, however small,
that you can recall,

708
00:53:24,961 --> 00:53:28,960
that would help us substantiate
your version of events?

709
00:53:29,133 --> 00:53:31,089
I... I blacked out.

710
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:33,586
I mean,
I don't know what happened.

711
00:53:33,721 --> 00:53:38,098
I just woke up in that place
and there was blood everywhere.

712
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:58,114
Can I get you anything?

713
00:54:02,292 --> 00:54:04,366
Are you sure?

714
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:16,134
Look, honey...

715
00:54:16,305 --> 00:54:19,390
I was supposed to go to the campus
and pick up some work.

716
00:54:19,558 --> 00:54:22,132
I'm concerned about
leaving you alone though.

717
00:54:23,772 --> 00:54:25,810
I'll only be
about 20 minutes.

718
00:54:25,981 --> 00:54:26,931
Trevor...

719
00:54:30,611 --> 00:54:33,186
Where were you last night?

720
00:54:33,365 --> 00:54:35,903
I was here.
I was fast asleep.

721
00:54:36,076 --> 00:54:39,491
I thought you were
with Bernadette.

722
00:54:41,497 --> 00:54:43,289
Look, honey...

723
00:54:43,457 --> 00:54:44,951
I'm going to stand by you.

724
00:54:45,126 --> 00:54:48,245
We're going to get through this OK?

725
00:54:50,047 --> 00:54:51,590
I'll be right back.

726
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:17,254
Believe in me.

727
00:58:17,424 --> 00:58:18,503
Be my victim.

728
00:58:35,149 --> 00:58:36,892
Do you believe in me?

729
00:58:37,902 --> 00:58:39,527
Keep away from me.

730
00:58:39,696 --> 00:58:41,238
I have the child.

731
00:58:41,406 --> 00:58:45,653
Allow me to take you
or he will die in your place.

732
00:58:50,081 --> 00:58:51,195
Your disbelief

733
00:58:51,374 --> 00:58:54,659
destroyed the faith
of my congregation.

734
00:58:54,836 --> 00:58:57,161
Without them,
I am nothing.

735
00:58:57,338 --> 00:59:00,459
So I was obliged to come.

736
00:59:00,634 --> 00:59:03,420
And now I must kill you.

737
00:59:04,638 --> 00:59:08,421
Your death will be a tale
to frighten children,

738
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:12,348
to make lovers cling closer
in their rapture.

739
00:59:12,478 --> 00:59:16,855
Come with me
and be immortal.

740
00:59:30,747 --> 00:59:31,743
Helen?

741
00:59:38,587 --> 00:59:40,497
Bernadette...

742
00:59:43,802 --> 00:59:45,344
Bernadette, go.

743
00:59:45,512 --> 00:59:46,627
Helen?

744
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:49,755
Helen, honey.

745
00:59:49,933 --> 00:59:51,178
It's Bernadette.

746
00:59:51,351 --> 00:59:52,466
Let me in.

747
00:59:52,644 --> 00:59:53,723
He's here.

748
01:00:02,862 --> 01:00:05,484
Bernadette, go!

749
01:00:06,158 --> 01:00:07,902
Helen!

750
01:00:08,077 --> 01:00:09,619
Helen?

751
01:00:09,786 --> 01:00:11,993
Go! Get out!

752
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,667
Oh, no, no...

753
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:46,774
Trevor...

754
01:00:46,908 --> 01:00:49,232
Trevor, he's here.

755
01:00:49,368 --> 01:00:51,194
He's here. He's...

756
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:52,912
...here.

757
01:00:57,501 --> 01:00:59,410
Don't let him kill me.

758
01:01:03,674 --> 01:01:04,871
Trevor...

759
01:01:13,727 --> 01:01:15,304
Trevor...

760
01:01:18,772 --> 01:01:19,804
Trevor...

761
01:01:21,525 --> 01:01:22,771
Trevor!

762
01:01:25,446 --> 01:01:26,561
Trevor!

763
01:01:26,739 --> 01:01:30,107
Trevor! Trevor!

764
01:01:38,834 --> 01:01:39,866
Take her outside.

765
01:01:42,087 --> 01:01:45,124
Trevor...

766
01:01:45,299 --> 01:01:47,126
Hold me, Trevor, please?

767
01:01:57,395 --> 01:01:58,938
"That's correct."

768
01:02:03,193 --> 01:02:05,267
"Unit 212, come in, please."

769
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:13,108
"Why do you want to live?"

770
01:02:13,243 --> 01:02:15,865
"If you had learned
just a little from me..

771
01:02:15,996 --> 01:02:18,748
you would not beg to live."

772
01:02:18,874 --> 01:02:21,117
"I am rumour."

773
01:02:21,294 --> 01:02:24,295
"It is a blessed condition,
believe me."

774
01:02:24,422 --> 01:02:27,708
"To be whispered about
at street corners..

775
01:02:27,842 --> 01:02:30,415
to live
in other people's dreams..

776
01:02:30,553 --> 01:02:32,711
but not to have to be."

777
01:02:34,723 --> 01:02:37,049
"Do you understand?"

778
01:03:03,294 --> 01:03:04,671
"Please, God,

779
01:03:04,838 --> 01:03:07,708
don't let him kill the baby."

780
01:03:34,034 --> 01:03:35,362
Trevor!

781
01:03:36,578 --> 01:03:38,867
Trevor?

782
01:03:41,332 --> 01:03:42,708
Trevor!

783
01:03:58,933 --> 01:04:01,471
Where are you going?

784
01:04:01,644 --> 01:04:03,471
No, you can't leave me here.

785
01:04:03,647 --> 01:04:06,434
I can't defend myself!

786
01:04:26,587 --> 01:04:28,331
No.

787
01:04:30,215 --> 01:04:33,133
What do the good know

788
01:04:33,303 --> 01:04:36,752
except what the bad teach them
by their excesses?

789
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:38,970
Murderer.

790
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:41,346
Allow me at least a kiss.

791
01:04:41,517 --> 01:04:44,603
Just one exquisite kiss.

792
01:04:46,648 --> 01:04:48,190
Murderer!

793
01:04:48,358 --> 01:04:49,638
Help!

794
01:04:49,776 --> 01:04:51,769
Listen, he's under the bed!

795
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:55,901
Bring me 1,000 mils!

796
01:04:56,034 --> 01:04:57,694
Listen, he's here.

797
01:04:57,869 --> 01:04:59,198
He's under the bed!

798
01:04:59,371 --> 01:05:01,030
No, don't.

799
01:06:04,352 --> 01:06:06,144
She's coming around.

800
01:06:06,271 --> 01:06:07,682
Good morning.

801
01:06:07,856 --> 01:06:09,931
I'd like to speak
to my husband.

802
01:06:11,276 --> 01:06:12,604
So would I.

803
01:06:12,777 --> 01:06:13,727
Here we go.

804
01:06:13,904 --> 01:06:15,444
What time is it?

805
01:06:15,612 --> 01:06:17,440
Where are we going?

806
01:06:17,615 --> 01:06:19,323
We're going to Disneyland.

807
01:06:32,546 --> 01:06:34,705
Clyde, open it up.

808
01:06:34,882 --> 01:06:35,832
Winley?

809
01:06:36,009 --> 01:06:37,668
Clyde, open it up.

810
01:06:37,843 --> 01:06:40,594
What the hell you all
doing back there, huh?

811
01:06:40,762 --> 01:06:42,173
A little reading?

812
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:45,552
Break.

813
01:06:48,855 --> 01:06:50,599
Dr Burke?

814
01:06:50,815 --> 01:06:51,811
Yes?

815
01:06:56,029 --> 01:06:58,355
Miss Lyle,
I'm Dr Burke.

816
01:07:07,497 --> 01:07:09,954
I'd like to speak to my husband.

817
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:12,118
I'm sure we can arrange a visit.

818
01:07:12,295 --> 01:07:13,872
A visit?

819
01:07:14,046 --> 01:07:15,707
Have I been committed?

820
01:07:21,721 --> 01:07:25,257
Do you really think
these restraints are necessary?

821
01:07:28,478 --> 01:07:30,851
Helen, this...

822
01:07:31,023 --> 01:07:32,647
is a writ of detention

823
01:07:32,816 --> 01:07:35,141
from the state
attorney's office.

824
01:07:35,319 --> 01:07:37,110
Now, for
the past month...

825
01:07:37,278 --> 01:07:39,685
- Month?
- Yes.

826
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:44,034
...we have been stabilizing you
on a heavy dosage of Thorazine.

827
01:07:44,202 --> 01:07:47,286
You probably remember
very little or nothing.

828
01:07:47,456 --> 01:07:49,364
Get me my attorney.

829
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:51,699
I'm working for
your defence.

830
01:07:51,918 --> 01:07:55,334
We have to assess
your ability to stand trial.

831
01:07:55,505 --> 01:08:00,048
Helen, you've been charged
with first-degree murder.

832
01:08:09,394 --> 01:08:12,478
Why don't you tell me
what happened in your apartment?

833
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:40,294
'Oh!'

834
01:08:43,387 --> 01:08:45,011
The night
you were admitted

835
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:47,753
did the killer
appear to you?

836
01:08:47,891 --> 01:08:49,801
"Murderer!"

837
01:08:49,977 --> 01:08:51,091
"Murderer!"

838
01:08:51,228 --> 01:08:53,101
"Murderer!"

839
01:08:53,271 --> 01:08:54,730
"Help me!"

840
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,684
"He's here!"

841
01:08:58,861 --> 01:09:00,403
"He's under the bed!"

842
01:09:00,571 --> 01:09:01,899
"No!"

843
01:09:02,072 --> 01:09:03,318
"Help me!"

844
01:09:03,491 --> 01:09:04,866
I don't understand.

845
01:09:04,992 --> 01:09:07,234
"Help! Please!"

846
01:09:07,453 --> 01:09:08,483
"He's here!"

847
01:09:08,703 --> 01:09:10,697
"Help me! Help me!"

848
01:09:10,831 --> 01:09:11,993
"Please!"

849
01:09:13,124 --> 01:09:14,322
"He's under the bed!"

850
01:09:14,459 --> 01:09:15,574
"He's under the bed!"

851
01:09:15,794 --> 01:09:17,039
That's not possible.

852
01:09:17,171 --> 01:09:18,913
'Bring me 1,000 mils!'

853
01:09:24,345 --> 01:09:25,721
Bernadette...

854
01:09:36,022 --> 01:09:38,015
I'm not capable of that.

855
01:09:44,199 --> 01:09:47,401
No matter what's going wrong...

856
01:09:47,869 --> 01:09:49,363
I know one thing...

857
01:09:49,538 --> 01:09:51,328
...that no part of me,

858
01:09:51,497 --> 01:09:53,656
no matter how hidden

859
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:55,334
is capable of that.

860
01:10:02,466 --> 01:10:03,876
I can prove it.

861
01:10:04,009 --> 01:10:05,290
How?

862
01:10:08,389 --> 01:10:09,931
I can call him.

863
01:10:21,277 --> 01:10:24,397
Candyman...

864
01:10:24,571 --> 01:10:26,444
Candyman...

865
01:10:26,573 --> 01:10:28,068
Candyman...

866
01:10:38,211 --> 01:10:40,500
...Candyman.

867
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,061
Oh! Oh!

868
01:11:15,331 --> 01:11:17,739
You're mine now.

869
01:11:17,876 --> 01:11:23,545
Tonight our congregation
shall witness a new... miracle.

870
01:11:43,109 --> 01:11:44,308
Dr Burke?

871
01:11:49,073 --> 01:11:50,817
Dr Burke?

872
01:11:50,992 --> 01:11:52,653
Dr Burke!

873
01:11:52,828 --> 01:11:55,152
Please answer us!

874
01:11:55,330 --> 01:11:57,454
Dr Burke!

875
01:12:27,695 --> 01:12:31,112
Code nine to ward b-5, stat.

876
01:12:37,330 --> 01:12:39,037
Check the west wing.

877
01:12:42,294 --> 01:12:43,622
Let's go!

878
01:12:43,795 --> 01:12:45,075
Go, go, go!

879
01:12:47,091 --> 01:12:50,293
Do we have a direction on this one?
Where is she?

880
01:13:11,823 --> 01:13:13,697
Please be home, Trevor.

881
01:13:13,825 --> 01:13:15,154
Please be home.

882
01:14:12,843 --> 01:14:14,338
Get out of my home.

883
01:14:17,056 --> 01:14:18,930
Trevor!

884
01:14:19,099 --> 01:14:20,843
What's the matter, sweetie pie?

885
01:14:21,018 --> 01:14:23,095
Did you make another little boo-boo?

886
01:14:24,312 --> 01:14:26,519
What are you doing here?

887
01:14:26,690 --> 01:14:29,442
I live here, remember?

888
01:14:29,609 --> 01:14:31,234
Call the hospital.

889
01:14:35,407 --> 01:14:37,530
Don't touch the phone.

890
01:14:51,632 --> 01:14:53,293
What's the matter, Trevor?

891
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,884
Scared of something?

892
01:15:09,859 --> 01:15:12,564
I hate the color scheme.

893
01:15:15,615 --> 01:15:17,110
What were you going to do?

894
01:15:17,284 --> 01:15:19,572
Wait till I got out
before you told me?!

895
01:15:20,411 --> 01:15:21,656
Helen...

896
01:15:21,829 --> 01:15:24,285
But you knew
I was never coming out,

897
01:15:24,457 --> 01:15:25,701
didn't you?

898
01:15:26,959 --> 01:15:29,451
I think we should call the hospital.

899
01:15:32,965 --> 01:15:34,425
OK.

900
01:15:37,721 --> 01:15:38,669
Go on.

901
01:15:40,807 --> 01:15:42,135
Go on.

902
01:15:42,350 --> 01:15:44,177
Is that what you want to do?

903
01:15:45,854 --> 01:15:48,688
Call them.

904
01:16:13,923 --> 01:16:17,089
I'm not a murderer.

905
01:16:17,634 --> 01:16:19,960
I'm not.

906
01:16:20,554 --> 01:16:24,256
Trevor, you were all I had left.

907
01:16:26,394 --> 01:16:27,640
Oh...

908
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:47,582
It's over.

909
01:16:59,761 --> 01:17:03,212
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

910
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:26,908
They will all abandon you.

911
01:17:37,507 --> 01:17:42,964
All you have left
is my desire for you.

912
01:21:32,285 --> 01:21:33,781
Helen.

913
01:21:36,373 --> 01:21:38,532
You came to me.

914
01:21:40,795 --> 01:21:42,288
The child.

915
01:21:44,590 --> 01:21:46,417
We had a deal.

916
01:21:46,634 --> 01:21:49,041
Surrender to me now

917
01:21:49,219 --> 01:21:52,469
and he shall be unharmed.

918
01:22:04,359 --> 01:22:06,151
We have a bargain.

919
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,194
But I'm afraid.

920
01:22:08,322 --> 01:22:11,156
Do you fear the pain
or what is beyond?

921
01:22:11,325 --> 01:22:12,819
Both.

922
01:22:12,993 --> 01:22:16,861
The pain, I can assure you,
will be exquisite.

923
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:20,741
As for our deaths,
there is nothing to fear.

924
01:22:20,919 --> 01:22:25,081
Our names will be written
on a thousand walls.

925
01:22:25,255 --> 01:22:27,081
Our crimes told

926
01:22:27,256 --> 01:22:30,958
and retold
by our faithful believers.

927
01:22:31,136 --> 01:22:35,217
We shall die together
in front of their very eyes

928
01:22:35,391 --> 01:22:37,762
and give them something

929
01:22:37,934 --> 01:22:39,808
to be haunted by.

930
01:22:39,937 --> 01:22:41,480
Come with me

931
01:22:42,607 --> 01:22:45,145
and be immortal.

932
01:22:58,664 --> 01:22:59,862
No!

933
01:23:08,633 --> 01:23:10,709
No!

934
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:30,277
Hush.

935
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,734
Hush.

936
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:36,863
You're mine now.

937
01:23:36,996 --> 01:23:40,244
It's time for a new miracle.

938
01:25:01,913 --> 01:25:05,117
It was always you, Helen.

939
01:25:05,292 --> 01:25:07,498
It was always you.

940
01:26:24,288 --> 01:26:26,614
He's here.

941
01:27:00,532 --> 01:27:01,908
I'm coming.

942
01:27:08,124 --> 01:27:09,666
It's OK.

943
01:27:09,834 --> 01:27:12,539
Check it out, man.

944
01:27:14,547 --> 01:27:16,624
Oh, yes.

945
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:19,373
What happened?

946
01:27:19,553 --> 01:27:23,003
We got the Candyman out there.

947
01:27:23,179 --> 01:27:25,468
I saw him go in there.

948
01:27:25,723 --> 01:27:27,551
Candyman's in there.

949
01:27:27,726 --> 01:27:29,305
I saw him.

950
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:36,524
I knew you'd come.

951
01:27:37,987 --> 01:27:39,861
Burn him.

952
01:27:44,202 --> 01:27:46,195
Hush.

953
01:27:46,371 --> 01:27:50,154
Burn him, burn him,
burn him, burn him...

954
01:27:52,711 --> 01:27:55,747
Burn him, burn him!

955
01:27:55,922 --> 01:27:58,495
Help!

956
01:27:58,674 --> 01:28:01,545
Burn him, burn him, burn him!

957
01:28:01,719 --> 01:28:04,044
Help... help me!

958
01:28:04,222 --> 01:28:06,130
Burn him, burn him!

959
01:28:06,307 --> 01:28:09,510
You lied to me!

960
01:28:09,644 --> 01:28:13,808
We must be on our way now,
you and I.

961
01:28:13,982 --> 01:28:16,389
Our bones will soon be ashes

962
01:28:16,567 --> 01:28:19,403
and we shall never

963
01:28:19,571 --> 01:28:20,981
be separated again.

964
01:28:21,156 --> 01:28:22,436
Let me go.

965
01:28:22,573 --> 01:28:23,902
I cannot.

966
01:28:24,075 --> 01:28:27,029
We are already dead.

967
01:28:34,836 --> 01:28:36,414
Helen!

968
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:13,413
Come back to me!

969
01:29:24,970 --> 01:29:26,880
Come back!

970
01:30:36,417 --> 01:30:39,667
We commend to almighty God
our sister Helen

971
01:30:39,837 --> 01:30:42,623
and we commit her body
to the ground.

972
01:30:42,797 --> 01:30:46,380
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

973
01:30:46,551 --> 01:30:50,004
The lord bless her and keep her
and give her peace.

974
01:30:50,139 --> 01:30:52,178
God of holiness and power

975
01:30:52,308 --> 01:30:55,677
accept our prayers on behalf
of your servant Helen.

976
01:30:55,812 --> 01:30:58,136
Do not count
her deeds against her.

977
01:30:58,398 --> 01:31:01,648
For in her heart she desired
to do your will.

978
01:31:01,776 --> 01:31:03,648
May almighty God bless you

979
01:31:03,861 --> 01:31:06,566
the Father and the Son
and the Holy Spirit.

980
01:31:14,830 --> 01:31:17,666
My God, look at that.

981
01:31:19,918 --> 01:31:21,828
Trevor?

982
01:32:36,204 --> 01:32:37,828
Trevor?

983
01:32:38,998 --> 01:32:41,669
What is it?

984
01:32:41,835 --> 01:32:43,626
Trevor, are you all right?

985
01:32:43,796 --> 01:32:46,418
Yeah, I'm fine.

986
01:32:46,548 --> 01:32:49,300
Aren't you hungry?

987
01:32:49,468 --> 01:32:50,961
No, I'm OK.

988
01:32:51,136 --> 01:32:53,294
I'll eat a little bit later.

989
01:32:53,471 --> 01:32:56,970
I was going to make us
a nice dinner.

990
01:32:57,183 --> 01:32:58,890
OK, whatever.

991
01:33:40,976 --> 01:33:44,345
Hey, why don't you help me
make the salad?

992
01:33:45,816 --> 01:33:48,733
OK, I'll be there
in a minute.

993
01:33:58,329 --> 01:34:00,155
Helen...

994
01:34:09,381 --> 01:34:12,085
Oh, Helen.

995
01:34:16,930 --> 01:34:18,638
Helen.

996
01:34:24,438 --> 01:34:26,229
Helen.

997
01:34:32,321 --> 01:34:34,194
Helen.

998
01:34:34,531 --> 01:34:36,608
Ow.

999
01:34:41,164 --> 01:34:43,203
What's the matter, Trevor?

1000
01:34:43,333 --> 01:34:45,407
Scared of something?

1001
01:34:55,594 --> 01:34:57,836
Trevor?

1002
01:34:58,013 --> 01:35:00,800
