1
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:38,619
<i>They will say</i>
<i>that I have shed innocent blood.</i>

2
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,036
<i>What's blood for...</i>

3
00:02:43,254 --> 00:02:45,377
<i>if not for shedding?</i>

4
00:02:47,174 --> 00:02:49,665
<i>With my hook for a hand,</i>

5
00:02:49,885 --> 00:02:54,381
<i>I'll split you from your groin</i>
<i>to your gullet.</i>

6
00:03:15,077 --> 00:03:18,909
<i>I came for you.</i>

7
00:03:25,671 --> 00:03:29,372
It's the scariest story
I have ever heard, and it's true.

8
00:03:29,592 --> 00:03:33,292
<i>It happened a few years ago</i>
<i>near Moses Lake in Indiana.</i>

9
00:03:33,512 --> 00:03:35,968
<i>Clara was babysitting for the Johnsons.</i>

10
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:39,597
<i>And Billy pulls up on his motorcycle.</i>

11
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,271
<i>She wasn't going out with Billy</i>
<i>but with Michael for about six months.</i>

12
00:03:44,482 --> 00:03:49,820
<i>But she always had the hots for Billy</i>
<i>cos he was like, a bad boy.</i>

13
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:52,864
<i>And Michael was just... so nice.</i>

14
00:03:53,073 --> 00:03:56,525
<i>So, anyway,</i>
<i>she decides that tonight's the night</i>

15
00:03:56,744 --> 00:04:00,113
<i>that she's gonna give Billy</i>
<i>what she never gave to Michael.</i>

16
00:04:00,331 --> 00:04:03,450
Have you ever heard of Candyman?
No.

17
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:07,083
Well, his right hand is sawn off.

18
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:10,250
He has a hook
jammed in the bloody stump.

19
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:15,964
And if you look in the mirror
and you say his name five times,

20
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:21,015
he'll appear behind you
breathing down your neck.

21
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,266
You wanna try it?

22
00:04:26,106 --> 00:04:28,146
<i>So Billy began.</i>

23
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:31,894
<i>He looked in the mirror and he said...</i>
Candyman.

24
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,112
Candyman.

25
00:04:38,035 --> 00:04:40,075
Candyman.

26
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:43,578
Candyman.

27
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:51,294
No one ever got past four.

28
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,418
Not here.

29
00:04:56,637 --> 00:05:00,302
Go downstairs.
I have a surprise for you.

30
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:12,186
<i>She looked in the mirror and,</i>
<i>I don't know why,</i>

31
00:05:12,403 --> 00:05:14,810
<i>but she said his name the last time.</i>

32
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,070
Candyman.

33
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,322
<i>She turned out the lights...</i>

34
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:25,958
What he saw
turned his hair white from shock.

35
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,708
Killed her, split her open with his hook

36
00:05:30,921 --> 00:05:33,412
and then killed the baby too.

37
00:05:33,632 --> 00:05:36,302
Billy got away, but

38
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,550
soon after, he went crazy.

39
00:05:39,638 --> 00:05:43,506
My roommate's boyfriend knows him.

40
00:05:49,565 --> 00:05:51,973
So, when did you first hear this story?

41
00:05:52,193 --> 00:05:55,063
My friend heard it on the radio.
It's sick.

42
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,324
The babysitter just roasted the kid,
like it was a turkey or something.

43
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:04,912
So, what's the deal? You guys doing
a page on serial killers or something?

44
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:08,871
Something like that.
That's it. We're done.

45
00:06:09,084 --> 00:06:10,911
All right.
Thanks.

46
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:12,503
No problem.

47
00:06:12,713 --> 00:06:14,255
See ya.
See ya.

48
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,594
See ya.

49
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:21,962
They get younger every day.

50
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:29,348
Does anybody remember
the craze for pet baby alligators?

51
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:33,146
When they got big,
people flushed them down the toilet.

52
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:37,439
They live in the sewers now.
Some of them are 30 feet long.

53
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:39,694
Where did this happen?

54
00:06:39,907 --> 00:06:43,525
Miami. They went blind
from living in the dark.

55
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:48,821
It wasn't Miami, it was New York.
I read it in the paper.

56
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,244
Then it must be true.

57
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:57,372
Why would Danny and Diane both
be suffering from the same delusion

58
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:59,667
in two cities 1,000 miles apart?

59
00:07:01,804 --> 00:07:07,225
Let's face it, folks.
There are no alligators in the sewers.

60
00:07:07,434 --> 00:07:12,511
No, it's round the campfire,
it's bedtime stories.

61
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:17,477
These stories are modern, oral folklore.

62
00:07:17,695 --> 00:07:22,404
They are the unselfconscious reflection
of the fears of urban society.

63
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:25,072
That's lunch.

64
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:44,922
... primordial reptile.

65
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:47,178
It's a monster, right? Why?

66
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:52,391
Ouch. Ooh. Eugh.

67
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,641
Ah, the dashing professor.
The lovely wife.

68
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:57,767
Hello.

69
00:07:57,985 --> 00:08:03,655
Helen, the crème de la crème.
Harold, Diane, Daniel, Stacey.

70
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:05,905
Hi.
Hello.

71
00:08:06,702 --> 00:08:10,071
Keep up the good work.
Thanks for your contributions.

72
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,246
Thanks. Bye.
See you.

73
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:15,122
Bye.

74
00:08:19,924 --> 00:08:21,038
See ya.

75
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,925
So you wanna tell me about this girl?
What's her name? Stacey.

76
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:35,473
She could barely look me in the eyes,
Trevor, and I swear she was blushing.

77
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:39,105
Well, I guess that's because
she's madly in love with me.

78
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,987
All those bursting adolescent hormones.

79
00:08:43,906 --> 00:08:47,357
You don't really think...
No, of course not.

80
00:08:47,576 --> 00:08:51,526
Good. I should hope not.
So, what's the matter?

81
00:08:52,623 --> 00:08:54,366
Trevor...

82
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:58,201
You said you wouldn't do urban legends
until next semester.

83
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:03,213
You knew Bernadette and I were gathering
data. Why did you have to ruin it?

84
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:06,925
Honey, you can't expect me
to hold up their education

85
00:09:07,138 --> 00:09:09,889
while the two of you
complete your thesis.

86
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:12,804
I have a curriculum to follow.
Yes, I know.

87
00:09:13,018 --> 00:09:15,854
Well? So don't be mad at me.

88
00:09:20,568 --> 00:09:24,400
<i>If you look in the</i>
<i>mirror and say his name five times,</i>

89
00:09:24,613 --> 00:09:27,484
<i>he'll appear behind you</i>
<i>breathing down your neck.</i>

90
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:40,460
Can I clean the room?
Oh, sure. Don't mind me.

91
00:09:40,671 --> 00:09:44,122
<i>So Billy began.</i>
<i>He looked in the mirror and he said,</i>

92
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:47,876
<i>"Candyman, Candyman, Candyman..."</i>

93
00:09:51,348 --> 00:09:53,388
Candyman, huh?

94
00:09:53,601 --> 00:09:56,767
Have you heard of him?
Mm-hmm. You doin' a study on him?

95
00:09:58,772 --> 00:10:00,849
Yes, I am. What have you heard?

96
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:04,317
Everybody's scared of him
once it gets dark.

97
00:10:04,528 --> 00:10:08,028
He live over at Cabrini.
My friend told me about him.

98
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,945
Cabrini-Green?
Yeah, in the projects.

99
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,110
I don't know too much about it,
but my friend, she know all about it.

100
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:17,370
Her cousin live at Cabrini.

101
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,991
They say he killed a lady.

102
00:10:20,211 --> 00:10:22,618
Can I talk to you friend?
Sure.

103
00:10:28,344 --> 00:10:30,835
Kitty?
Yeah? What do you want?

104
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:35,135
Lady down here wanna talk to you.
All right.

105
00:10:36,352 --> 00:10:38,391
She comin'.

106
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,396
I'm Helen Lyle.

107
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,768
Pleased to meet you.
Henrietta Mosely.

108
00:10:46,987 --> 00:10:49,027
And this is Kitty Culver.
Hello.

109
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,821
Tell her about the Candyman.

110
00:10:52,034 --> 00:10:57,277
All I know was there was some lady
in a tub, and she heard a noise.

111
00:10:57,498 --> 00:11:01,661
Do you remember her name?
I think her name was Ruthie Jean.

112
00:11:01,877 --> 00:11:06,255
She heard this bangin' like somebody
was tryin' to make a hole in the wall.

113
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:11,044
So Ruthie called 911 and said there's
somebody comin' through the walls.

114
00:11:11,262 --> 00:11:13,219
They didn't believe her.

115
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,470
They thought she was crazy.
Mm-hm.

116
00:11:15,683 --> 00:11:19,977
So she called 911 again,
and they still didn't believe her.

117
00:11:20,187 --> 00:11:23,437
When they finally got there,
she was dead.

118
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:27,184
Was she shot?
No...

119
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:31,235
Um, she was killed with a hook.

120
00:11:32,783 --> 00:11:35,274
It's true.
Yeah, it is.

121
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:38,744
I read it in the papers.
Candyman killed her.

122
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:44,627
Yeah, but I don't know
nothin' about that.

123
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:46,773
This is sick.
This isn't a fairytale.

124
00:12:46,982 --> 00:12:49,438
A woman got killed here. Jesus.

125
00:12:49,652 --> 00:12:52,024
That's not the half of it.

126
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:56,775
That's Cabrini-Green,
not that you'd recognize it.

127
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:59,566
No kidding.
I won't even drive past there.

128
00:12:59,787 --> 00:13:02,823
A kid got shot there the other day.
Every day.

129
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,911
Look carefully at this picture.

130
00:13:06,126 --> 00:13:08,166
And then this one.

131
00:13:15,386 --> 00:13:17,425
You spot it?

132
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,889
No.

133
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:24,761
That's not Cabrini-Green.
That's this building, Lincoln Village.

134
00:13:24,979 --> 00:13:27,648
My apartment was built
as a housing project.

135
00:13:28,732 --> 00:13:31,105
No?
Yeah.

136
00:13:31,318 --> 00:13:33,358
Now take a look at this.

137
00:13:43,664 --> 00:13:48,575
The city realized there was no barrier
between here and the Gold Coast.

138
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:52,459
Unlike the highway and the El train
to keep the ghetto cut off.

139
00:13:52,673 --> 00:13:55,164
Exactly.
So they made some alterations.

140
00:13:55,384 --> 00:14:00,260
They covered the cinder block in plaster
and sold the lot off as condos.

141
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:04,422
How much did you pay for this place?
Don't ask.

142
00:14:07,271 --> 00:14:09,311
Now wait till you see this.

143
00:14:11,859 --> 00:14:13,898
Here's the proof.

144
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,697
The killer, or killers,

145
00:14:21,368 --> 00:14:25,069
they don't know which, smashed through
the back of this cabinet.

146
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:27,329
See, there's no wall there.

147
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:31,076
Only a medicine chest
separates us from the other apartment.

148
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:35,209
There could be somebody on the toilet!

149
00:14:35,424 --> 00:14:38,875
The apartment's vacant.
Are you sure?

150
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,381
There.

151
00:14:42,264 --> 00:14:44,304
OK. Now take a look.

152
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,511
That is amazing.

153
00:14:50,731 --> 00:14:53,056
What?
I saw a light go on.

154
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:55,315
There's nobody there.

155
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,901
Psyche.
That's not funny.

156
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:03,149
You didn't scare me at all.
Yeah, right.

157
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,913
You don't believe all
that nonsense, do you?

158
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,286
I don't. Do you?

159
00:15:14,505 --> 00:15:15,501
No.

160
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,592
All right.

161
00:15:19,802 --> 00:15:23,005
Candyman, Candyman, Candyman,

162
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,261
Candyman...

163
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,266
Candyman.

164
00:15:31,272 --> 00:15:33,311
Oh, you chicken!

165
00:15:33,524 --> 00:15:35,813
You have to do it five times.
Go again.

166
00:16:00,718 --> 00:16:01,714
Trevor?

167
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:15,856
Oh, Trevor!
What? Who were you expecting?

168
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,644
What time is it?
It's late, and I'm smashed.

169
00:16:23,824 --> 00:16:25,864
Sorry I scared you.

170
00:16:59,944 --> 00:17:03,147
What's with the arsenal?
We're only going eight blocks.

171
00:17:03,364 --> 00:17:07,611
You got us dressed up like cops.
I just said dress conservatively.

172
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:10,199
No, we look like cops.

173
00:17:10,412 --> 00:17:12,950
Why are you trying to scare me?
I'm not.

174
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:17,708
I just want you to know the gangs
hold this whole neighborhood hostage.

175
00:17:20,548 --> 00:17:22,587
OK, let's just turn around.

176
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,335
We can write a boring thesis
regurgitating all the usual crap

177
00:17:26,554 --> 00:17:29,555
about urban legend.

178
00:17:33,102 --> 00:17:36,138
We've got a real shot here, Bernadette.

179
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:41,350
A community attributes the daily horrors
of their lives to a mythical figure.

180
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:46,028
If Trevor and Archie were here,
would they chicken out?

181
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,111
In a second.
Exactly.

182
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:53,326
All right.

183
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,333
You wanna wait here for me?
No.

184
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,625
Well, then let's go.

185
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,594
- Check 'em out.
- Lock the car.

186
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,508
Hey, now.

187
00:18:55,726 --> 00:18:58,846
Want somethin', baby?
I got it for you.

188
00:18:59,063 --> 00:19:01,102
Say, yo, mama.
Come on, baby.

189
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:04,682
Yo, baby.

190
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,774
Which way you goin'?
Just going inside.

191
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:10,400
Yeah?

192
00:19:11,075 --> 00:19:14,942
You can't come up in here.
Who you lookin' for?

193
00:19:15,162 --> 00:19:18,662
Just going up to see a friend.
Sure you're not the police?

194
00:19:18,874 --> 00:19:20,914
Look like Five-O to me.

195
00:19:21,752 --> 00:19:23,792
Ask blondie where she goin'.

196
00:19:24,004 --> 00:19:28,999
Who you goin' to see?
Let's take the stairs. Come on.

197
00:19:29,218 --> 00:19:31,257
Where you all goin' there?

198
00:19:35,683 --> 00:19:39,930
Heads up, people.
Five-O comin' up the back door. Police!

199
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:45,190
It's OK. They think we're cops.
They're not going to follow us.

200
00:19:51,532 --> 00:19:53,571
Hang on.

201
00:20:15,264 --> 00:20:17,304
Look at this.
This is great.

202
00:20:20,895 --> 00:20:22,934
"Sweets to..."

203
00:20:24,482 --> 00:20:27,151
"The sweet."
"Sweets to the sweet."

204
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:32,315
Hurry up, Helen.
Lemme get the door.

205
00:20:40,414 --> 00:20:42,454
Sorry.
Jesus, Helen.

206
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:49,287
Here it is.
Don't go in there.

207
00:20:52,843 --> 00:20:54,883
Come on.

208
00:20:57,348 --> 00:20:59,387
Jesus, it stinks.

209
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:10,519
I was right.
The layout is identical.

210
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:13,571
Which means that the bathroom
is over there.

211
00:21:13,781 --> 00:21:15,939
Helen...
What's the problem?

212
00:21:16,158 --> 00:21:18,198
A woman died in there.
Leave it.

213
00:21:27,002 --> 00:21:29,244
It's all right.
There's nothing to see.

214
00:21:39,515 --> 00:21:42,184
Wait.
This is where he broke through, right?

215
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:43,389
Yeah.

216
00:21:50,317 --> 00:21:53,651
Well, we found it. Let's go.
Wait a second.

217
00:21:58,534 --> 00:22:00,573
OK. Hang onto this.

218
00:22:03,747 --> 00:22:05,823
I'm just gonna go through.

219
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,615
Then we're outta here.
You're kidding.

220
00:22:08,836 --> 00:22:10,330
It's a derelict apartment.

221
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:13,381
What if somebody's
packing drugs in there?

222
00:22:13,591 --> 00:22:17,042
You gonna apologize
and give 'em your card? Huh?

223
00:22:17,261 --> 00:22:19,301
All right. Let's listen.

224
00:22:26,103 --> 00:22:29,270
There's nobody in there.
OK.

225
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:31,521
Hurry up. Be careful.

226
00:22:41,702 --> 00:22:43,908
Give me the camera.

227
00:22:44,121 --> 00:22:46,446
You got five minutes.
OK. Five.

228
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:48,341
Damn it.

229
00:24:51,081 --> 00:24:53,323
Bernadette! Sorry.

230
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:56,080
I ran out of film. I gotta go back.
No way.

231
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:59,082
You can't...
No, way, Helen. We're outta here!

232
00:25:08,182 --> 00:25:11,302
Hey, what y'all doin' in there?

233
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:13,844
We're just leaving.

234
00:25:14,063 --> 00:25:18,641
You here for the sweets?
No. We're not cops.

235
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:22,394
We're from the university.
You don't belong here, lady.

236
00:25:22,613 --> 00:25:25,448
Goin' through people's apartments
and things.

237
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:28,445
My name is Helen Lyle.
This is Bernadette Walsh.

238
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:33,073
We're doing a thesis, and we were
wondering if we could talk to you.

239
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:35,955
Here. This is my card.

240
00:25:40,297 --> 00:25:42,337
My baby.

241
00:25:42,633 --> 00:25:44,673
Come on. Let's go.

242
00:25:49,473 --> 00:25:52,925
Whites don't ever come here,
'cept to cause us a problem.

243
00:25:53,144 --> 00:25:55,813
Believe me, that's not
what we want to do.

244
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:03,900
Let's go in.

245
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:14,828
So you're doing a study?

246
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:20,787
What you gonna say?
That we're bad? Hmm?

247
00:26:21,005 --> 00:26:24,255
We steal? We gang-bang?

248
00:26:24,884 --> 00:26:26,923
We all on drugs, right?

249
00:26:28,512 --> 00:26:31,264
We ain't all like
them assholes downstairs.

250
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:34,264
I just wanna raise my child good.

251
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:39,772
He's a beautiful little boy.
He's all I got.

252
00:26:39,982 --> 00:26:43,066
What's his name?
Anthony.

253
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:47,863
I'm Anne-Marie.

254
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,404
Anne-Marie McCoy.

255
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,158
Nice to meet you.
Sorry we disturbed you.

256
00:26:55,372 --> 00:26:58,788
We'll just get out of your way.
It's OK.

257
00:26:59,001 --> 00:27:01,124
I don't mean to be rude. It's...

258
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:04,836
You know, the white folks
that come round here

259
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:07,088
ain't too handshakin' with us.

260
00:27:08,886 --> 00:27:11,128
Hey, what you doin'?
Let me help you.

261
00:27:13,808 --> 00:27:15,847
Making a mess here, huh?

262
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,142
Thank you. Thanks.

263
00:27:20,356 --> 00:27:22,395
You got kids?
No, but I'd love one.

264
00:27:23,818 --> 00:27:25,442
Hey...

265
00:27:25,653 --> 00:27:27,941
Got my eye on this one, big time.

266
00:27:28,155 --> 00:27:31,441
Yeah.
They're not gonna get him.

267
00:27:41,836 --> 00:27:44,706
You wanna know about Ruthie Jean?

268
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:49,925
They all been here, you know?
Newspapers, cops.

269
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:54,180
Case workers. They all wanna know.

270
00:27:56,016 --> 00:27:58,056
I heard her screamin'.

271
00:28:00,855 --> 00:28:03,428
I heard her right through the walls.

272
00:28:04,358 --> 00:28:07,644
I dialed 911.
Nobody came.

273
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:12,991
Nobody came.
Everybody scared.

274
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:16,743
He come right through these walls,
you know?

275
00:28:17,371 --> 00:28:19,411
I-I'm scared.

276
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:22,872
Scared for my child.

277
00:28:25,462 --> 00:28:28,962
They ain't never gonna catch him.
Who?

278
00:28:30,384 --> 00:28:31,878
Candyman.

279
00:28:38,142 --> 00:28:41,309
If they saw something they liked,
they'd point.

280
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,190
They thought it was rude to point.

281
00:28:44,565 --> 00:28:48,016
What did they do?
They went...

282
00:28:48,235 --> 00:28:50,905
Spat over people.
Quite extraordinary.

283
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:55,152
Be nice.
I am being nice.

284
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:59,317
So how are the two most beautiful
graduate students getting along?

285
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:03,121
Trevor tells me you've been dabbling
in my favorite subject.

286
00:29:06,003 --> 00:29:09,502
I can't wait to review your data.
I can fit you in tomorrow.

287
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:12,420
We're not ready yet.

288
00:29:12,635 --> 00:29:16,549
That's the moment at which
I can be of greatest assistance.

289
00:29:16,764 --> 00:29:20,808
Before you disappear down a path
to academic oblivia.

290
00:29:21,018 --> 00:29:23,853
I think I've been there.

291
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:27,348
Actually, Purcell,
we're about to bury you.

292
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:30,484
Helen...
What?

293
00:29:31,237 --> 00:29:33,562
We'll have something for you soon.

294
00:29:33,781 --> 00:29:38,657
We only went to Cabrini today, and...
Ah! Cabrini-Green.

295
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:41,785
Candyman country.

296
00:29:43,332 --> 00:29:48,623
If you're after the hook man, read the
paper I wrote about him ten years ago.

297
00:29:48,838 --> 00:29:51,459
You do know the story, don't you?

298
00:29:52,174 --> 00:29:53,170
No...

299
00:30:01,475 --> 00:30:03,515
Then how are you going to bury me?

300
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,143
The legend first appeared in 1890.

301
00:30:12,695 --> 00:30:15,067
Candyman was the son of a slave.

302
00:30:16,282 --> 00:30:20,778
His father had amassed a considerable
fortune from designing a device

303
00:30:20,995 --> 00:30:23,996
for the mass-producing of shoes
after the Civil War.

304
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:28,366
Candyman had been
sent to the best schools

305
00:30:28,586 --> 00:30:30,625
and had grown up in polite society.

306
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:36,174
He had a prodigious talent
as an artist

307
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,547
and was much sought after when it came
to the documenting of one's wealth

308
00:30:42,766 --> 00:30:45,518
and position in society in a portrait.

309
00:30:47,229 --> 00:30:50,147
It was in this latter capacity

310
00:30:50,357 --> 00:30:53,109
that he was commissioned
by a wealthy landowner

311
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:56,106
to capture
his daughter's virginal beauty.

312
00:30:58,908 --> 00:31:01,315
Well, of course,
they fell deeply in love,

313
00:31:01,535 --> 00:31:04,370
and she became pregnant.

314
00:31:05,456 --> 00:31:07,365
Hmph.

315
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:09,622
Poor Candyman.

316
00:31:13,506 --> 00:31:16,672
The father executed
a terrible revenge.

317
00:31:18,093 --> 00:31:20,845
He paid a pack of brutal hooligans
to do the deed.

318
00:31:23,057 --> 00:31:26,342
They chased Candyman
through the town to Cabrini-Green,

319
00:31:27,561 --> 00:31:32,354
where they proceeded to saw off
his right hand with a rusty blade.

320
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:38,403
No one came to his aid.

321
00:31:38,614 --> 00:31:41,449
But this was just the beginning
of his ordeal.

322
00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:47,531
Nearby there was an apiary. Dozens
of hives, filled with hungry bees.

323
00:31:50,209 --> 00:31:53,792
They smashed the hives
and stole the honeycomb...

324
00:31:54,004 --> 00:31:57,254
...and smeared it
over his prone, naked body.

325
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:03,802
Candyman was stung to death
by the bees.

326
00:32:05,641 --> 00:32:08,428
<i>They burned his body</i>
<i>on a giant pyre</i>

327
00:32:08,644 --> 00:32:11,515
<i>and then scattered his ashes</i>
<i>over Cabrini-Green.</i>

328
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:27,574
Hello.

329
00:32:31,667 --> 00:32:33,126
Anne-Marie ain't in.

330
00:32:34,962 --> 00:32:39,209
Are you sure?
Yeah. She said you'd be back.

331
00:32:47,183 --> 00:32:49,306
What's your name?

332
00:32:49,518 --> 00:32:50,929
Jake.

333
00:32:53,022 --> 00:32:55,691
Well, listen, Jake,
maybe you can help me out.

334
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,316
I wanted to find out
about that woman who got killed.

335
00:32:59,528 --> 00:33:01,984
Do you know anything about that?

336
00:33:02,198 --> 00:33:03,941
Her name was Ruthie Jean.

337
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:07,156
I don't know nothin'.

338
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:09,243
Did anybody else talk about it?

339
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:15,910
It's OK to talk to me, Jake.

340
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:21,838
Cos I'm not a cop.

341
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,544
So nobody's gonna get in trouble.
I can't say nothin',

342
00:33:26,764 --> 00:33:28,803
or Candyman'll get me.

343
00:33:30,184 --> 00:33:32,223
Candyman, huh?

344
00:33:33,604 --> 00:33:35,513
You scared of him?

345
00:33:35,731 --> 00:33:37,937
I ain't scared of nobody.

346
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:41,235
But you're crazy
walkin' here on your own.

347
00:33:41,445 --> 00:33:44,446
It ain't safe around here.
Yeah, I know.

348
00:33:47,701 --> 00:33:50,572
But I don't scare
too easy either, Jake.

349
00:33:53,082 --> 00:33:56,036
You know, you don't have to tell me.

350
00:33:56,252 --> 00:33:58,291
You could just show me.

351
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:03,883
And if you show me where Candyman is,
I'll make you a promise.

352
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,800
It'll be our secret.

353
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,640
Unless you're too scared.

354
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:29,149
Somebody building a bonfire?
Yeah, for the party.

355
00:34:47,761 --> 00:34:49,837
In there.

356
00:34:50,055 --> 00:34:53,092
Candyman's in there?
My friend Charlie says so.

357
00:34:53,309 --> 00:34:55,800
A boy got killed there.

358
00:34:59,231 --> 00:35:01,271
Who was he?
Ain't sure.

359
00:35:01,484 --> 00:35:03,476
Charlie tell me he was weird.

360
00:35:03,694 --> 00:35:06,814
He was crazy?
No, a retard.

361
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,030
His mom was in the store.

362
00:35:12,578 --> 00:35:15,116
And the boy
needed to go to the bathroom.

363
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:20,490
His mom was takin' her time,
choosin' this, lookin' at that.

364
00:35:20,711 --> 00:35:23,914
So the boy started moanin'.
His mom get mad at him.

365
00:35:24,131 --> 00:35:25,958
Sent him across the street.

366
00:35:26,175 --> 00:35:29,793
His mom's at the checkout.
She hears her boy screamin'.

367
00:35:30,012 --> 00:35:33,013
Mommy! Mommy!

368
00:35:33,224 --> 00:35:37,553
There's a big tough guy.
He runs over to check it out.

369
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:41,845
<i>Come out of there shakin' and cryin'.</i>

370
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:44,682
He only been in there five seconds.

371
00:35:45,694 --> 00:35:49,110
Come out of there
and his hair turned white.

372
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:52,357
I mean, it turned white, just like that.

373
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:55,112
Was the boy murdered?

374
00:35:55,329 --> 00:36:00,454
Worse. He's lyin' on the floor
in a pool of blood, holdin' himself.

375
00:36:00,668 --> 00:36:04,997
Mommy! Mommy!

376
00:36:06,257 --> 00:36:08,961
They found it floating in a toilet.

377
00:36:09,176 --> 00:36:12,130
Can't fix that. Better off dead.

378
00:36:13,597 --> 00:36:15,222
Did Candyman do this?

379
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:25,940
Listen, you wait here for me, OK?
OK.

380
00:36:43,544 --> 00:36:44,540
Hello?

381
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,157
Candyman.

382
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:22,639
Oh, excuse me.

383
00:38:22,852 --> 00:38:25,343
I'm done here.
I'll just get out of your way.

384
00:38:31,902 --> 00:38:34,476
I don't want to interfere
with your business.

385
00:38:34,697 --> 00:38:38,564
I'm not a cop.
I'm from the University of Illinois.

386
00:38:40,327 --> 00:38:44,159
And...
I'll just get out of your way.

387
00:38:44,373 --> 00:38:46,781
Hey, come on! Let me go!

388
00:38:47,001 --> 00:38:49,040
You're not being very smart.

389
00:38:49,253 --> 00:38:52,124
My colleagues know where I am
and are expecting me.

390
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:53,834
Now let me go!

391
00:38:56,927 --> 00:38:59,928
I hear you're lookin'
for Candyman, bitch.

392
00:39:01,557 --> 00:39:03,466
Well, you found him.

393
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,702
We hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

394
00:39:22,912 --> 00:39:24,951
Step back.

395
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:30,657
Number four,
step forward and say the line.

396
00:39:30,878 --> 00:39:33,748
We hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

397
00:39:33,964 --> 00:39:36,004
Step back.

398
00:39:38,469 --> 00:39:40,960
Number five,
step forward and say the line.

399
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,753
We hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

400
00:39:43,974 --> 00:39:46,014
Step back. Take 'em out.

401
00:39:58,656 --> 00:40:01,325
Number five.
Good work.

402
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,283
How'd you catch him?
We swept the place.

403
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,576
Start from the top floor, work down.

404
00:40:11,794 --> 00:40:13,952
That way you can flush them all out.

405
00:40:14,171 --> 00:40:16,378
Whole of Cabrini's locked down now.

406
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:19,212
You're lucky to be alive, Ms Lyle.

407
00:40:22,471 --> 00:40:25,508
Did he kill Ruthie Jean?
No question.

408
00:40:25,724 --> 00:40:30,268
Killed that poor kid as well.
He ran the Overlords.

409
00:40:30,479 --> 00:40:32,768
We knew everything about him.

410
00:40:32,982 --> 00:40:37,276
We didn't bring him in before
because no one would testify.

411
00:40:37,486 --> 00:40:41,104
We can't protect them down
at Cabrini-Green. They knew that.

412
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:45,198
What about the little boy? Jake?

413
00:40:45,411 --> 00:40:47,949
We don't need him. We have you.

414
00:40:55,254 --> 00:40:57,293
Hey, Jake.

415
00:41:03,804 --> 00:41:06,342
I wanted to thank you
for saving my life.

416
00:41:06,557 --> 00:41:10,257
I wanna go home.
We'll get you outta here right away.

417
00:41:10,728 --> 00:41:13,598
You did good.
You said it was our secret.

418
00:41:13,814 --> 00:41:16,899
You lied.
It still is, Jake.

419
00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:19,600
You won't have to go to court.

420
00:41:21,489 --> 00:41:24,324
Candyman will get me.

421
00:41:25,826 --> 00:41:27,534
Candyman isn't real.

422
00:41:27,745 --> 00:41:30,070
He's just a story.

423
00:41:30,289 --> 00:41:33,575
You know, like Dracula or Frankenstein.

424
00:41:35,169 --> 00:41:38,668
A bad man took his name
so he could scare us.

425
00:41:38,881 --> 00:41:41,668
Now he's locked up.
Everything's gonna be OK.

426
00:41:43,093 --> 00:41:45,133
Candyman ain't real?

427
00:41:46,806 --> 00:41:48,348
No.

428
00:41:54,522 --> 00:41:57,060
Hey!
Slow down!

429
00:41:57,274 --> 00:42:01,106
You're supposed to be the invalid.
No, it's better. Look. See?

430
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,771
Yeah, it looks great.
Come and sit.

431
00:42:19,922 --> 00:42:23,208
You haven't eaten already, have you?
No, of course not.

432
00:42:24,135 --> 00:42:25,166
OK, good.

433
00:42:42,903 --> 00:42:45,608
Hey, welcome back.

434
00:42:46,574 --> 00:42:48,613
Thanks.
Let me see.

435
00:42:50,411 --> 00:42:53,281
I'm so glad you're OK.
I would've totally freaked.

436
00:42:53,497 --> 00:42:57,744
You know what bugs me? Two people
get murdered, and the cops do nothing.

437
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,163
A white woman's attacked,
and they lock the place down.

438
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,669
Yeah, I know,
but this was a bad guy.

439
00:43:03,883 --> 00:43:07,417
You got him put away.
That's all that matters.

440
00:43:07,636 --> 00:43:10,174
Oh! I've got a surprise for you.

441
00:43:10,389 --> 00:43:12,962
What?
You're not gonna believe it.

442
00:43:15,478 --> 00:43:19,345
The pictures.
A friend of mine saved most of them.

443
00:43:20,816 --> 00:43:24,019
I'd written them off.
The camera was smashed.

444
00:43:24,236 --> 00:43:27,154
And I've been talking
to some publishers.

445
00:43:27,364 --> 00:43:30,947
There's a lot of interest
since you made the local section.

446
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,283
We're gonna be published.

447
00:43:33,496 --> 00:43:36,366
I'll come over tomorrow,
and we'll get started.

448
00:43:36,582 --> 00:43:38,621
Yeah.
OK.

449
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,080
Helen...

450
00:44:21,919 --> 00:44:23,247
Yes.

451
00:44:23,462 --> 00:44:25,502
Helen...

452
00:44:33,097 --> 00:44:34,924
Who is that?

453
00:44:38,352 --> 00:44:40,179
Who is that?

454
00:44:42,481 --> 00:44:43,940
Helen...

455
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:46,189
I came for you.

456
00:45:07,006 --> 00:45:08,583
Do I know you?

457
00:45:08,799 --> 00:45:10,341
No...

458
00:45:10,551 --> 00:45:14,169
No, but you doubted me.

459
00:45:15,097 --> 00:45:19,759
I'm sorry. I have to go.
No need to leave yet.

460
00:45:24,315 --> 00:45:26,640
But I'm late.

461
00:45:26,859 --> 00:45:29,813
You are not content
with the stories,

462
00:45:30,029 --> 00:45:32,946
so I was obliged to come.

463
00:45:40,122 --> 00:45:41,830
Be my victim.

464
00:45:45,544 --> 00:45:47,584
Be my victim.

465
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:54,216
I am the writing on the wall,

466
00:45:54,428 --> 00:45:57,346
the whisper in the classroom.

467
00:45:57,556 --> 00:46:01,174
Without these things,
I am nothing.

468
00:46:01,393 --> 00:46:04,809
So now I must shed innocent blood.

469
00:46:05,648 --> 00:46:09,562
Come with me.

470
00:46:38,472 --> 00:46:39,883
Anthony!

471
00:46:40,349 --> 00:46:42,057
Anthony!

472
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:46,935
No, no! No...

473
00:46:58,868 --> 00:47:01,785
Anthony! No!

474
00:47:02,037 --> 00:47:05,987
Anne-Marie?
No! You bitch! You bitch!

475
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:08,331
Stay back!
Where's my baby?

476
00:47:10,796 --> 00:47:14,295
My baby!
You murderer! You...

477
00:47:17,511 --> 00:47:19,551
Please, stop!

478
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,599
Now, stop! Stop!

479
00:47:27,688 --> 00:47:29,266
Police! Open up!

480
00:47:29,482 --> 00:47:32,732
Hold it right there!
Back away! Now!

481
00:47:34,945 --> 00:47:36,404
Look out, look out!

482
00:47:53,464 --> 00:47:55,207
Remove your sweater.

483
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:05,180
Drop it and slide it over to me.

484
00:48:09,355 --> 00:48:11,394
Take off your brassiere.

485
00:48:13,067 --> 00:48:15,106
Can I please take a shower?

486
00:48:19,532 --> 00:48:21,571
Oh, God...

487
00:48:23,577 --> 00:48:25,653
Drop it and slide it over to me.

488
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,040
Lift up your arms.

489
00:48:33,629 --> 00:48:35,669
Lift your left breast.

490
00:48:36,966 --> 00:48:39,005
Your right.

491
00:48:42,638 --> 00:48:44,180
Remove your underwear.

492
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:48,434
Can I please speak
with Detective Valento?

493
00:48:48,644 --> 00:48:50,684
Remove your underwear.

494
00:48:54,316 --> 00:48:55,312
Frank...

495
00:49:03,701 --> 00:49:07,034
Ms Lyle, you're under arrest.
Do you understand?

496
00:49:11,834 --> 00:49:15,582
Please let me explain.
Do you understand?

497
00:49:18,215 --> 00:49:21,086
Yes, but...
You have the right to remain silent.

498
00:49:21,302 --> 00:49:23,590
Do you understand?

499
00:49:24,513 --> 00:49:28,048
This is crazy. I was attacked.
Respond to the question!

500
00:49:30,936 --> 00:49:33,178
I understand.

501
00:49:33,397 --> 00:49:39,482
At approximately 10pm, Anne-Marie McCoy
returned to her apartment.

502
00:49:39,695 --> 00:49:43,278
She discovered her dog
with its head cut off.

503
00:49:43,908 --> 00:49:48,985
She cried for assistance, at which point
you attacked her with a meat cleaver.

504
00:49:49,205 --> 00:49:51,956
You were still in possession
of this weapon

505
00:49:52,166 --> 00:49:54,704
when the arresting officers
came to her aid.

506
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,959
Where's the baby?

507
00:50:00,007 --> 00:50:03,091
I-I don't know.
You're sick.

508
00:50:10,476 --> 00:50:14,687
Before any further questions,
would you like to have counsel?

509
00:50:16,023 --> 00:50:18,063
Yes or no?

510
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:23,106
I-I-I would like to make a phone call.

511
00:50:39,421 --> 00:50:43,253
<i>We can't take your call.</i>
<i>Leave a message after the tone.</i>

512
00:50:44,468 --> 00:50:46,508
Trevor, are you there? Pick up.

513
00:50:49,265 --> 00:50:51,969
It's an emergency, Trevor.
Pick up the phone.

514
00:50:53,269 --> 00:50:57,017
<i>I've been arrested.</i>
<i>I'm at the 18th District.</i>

515
00:50:57,857 --> 00:51:01,060
<i>Can you please come pick me up?</i>

516
00:51:01,277 --> 00:51:03,316
That's it.

517
00:51:05,072 --> 00:51:07,112
Do you know what time it is?

518
00:51:07,908 --> 00:51:09,319
3am.

519
00:51:55,623 --> 00:51:56,702
Oh, God.

520
00:51:56,999 --> 00:52:00,333
There's gotta be another way out.

521
00:52:00,544 --> 00:52:03,878
Cover her face.
Don't say anything. Walk to the car.

522
00:52:04,089 --> 00:52:05,500
OK.

523
00:52:06,717 --> 00:52:09,635
You'll be fine. Stick with me.

524
00:52:11,138 --> 00:52:14,756
There she is!
Just keep your head down.

525
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:21,770
Right here!
Back off!

526
00:52:21,982 --> 00:52:25,067
Back off. We have no comment.
Nothing to say.

527
00:52:25,277 --> 00:52:27,317
We have absolutely nothing to say.

528
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:29,985
My client has not been charged
with a thing.

529
00:52:30,199 --> 00:52:32,238
<i>...information has indicated</i>

530
00:52:32,451 --> 00:52:36,069
<i>that baby Anthony was abducted</i>
<i>and may still be alive.</i>

531
00:52:36,288 --> 00:52:38,495
<i>The blood may have come from the dog.</i>

532
00:52:38,707 --> 00:52:41,412
<i>A suspect was released</i>
<i>after questioning,</i>

533
00:52:41,627 --> 00:52:45,376
<i>and I guess we'll just have to</i>
<i>follow this one as it devel...</i>

534
00:52:45,589 --> 00:52:50,335
Well, at least they didn't
mention your name. That's good.

535
00:52:53,681 --> 00:52:57,548
They haven't charged you because
they think they'll find the body.

536
00:52:57,768 --> 00:52:59,891
They're shooting for murder one,

537
00:53:00,104 --> 00:53:02,429
but I don't think
they have a chance.

538
00:53:08,028 --> 00:53:11,647
Do you think I did it?
No, nobody believes that.

539
00:53:13,993 --> 00:53:16,032
But it's crossed your mind?

540
00:53:20,207 --> 00:53:23,956
Is there anything,
any detail, however small,

541
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:28,547
that you can recall that would help us
substantiate your version of events?

542
00:53:28,757 --> 00:53:31,877
I-I blacked out.
I mean, I...

543
00:53:32,094 --> 00:53:34,668
I don't know what happened.

544
00:53:34,889 --> 00:53:38,305
I just woke up in that place,
and there was blood everywhere.

545
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,444
Can I get you anything?

546
00:54:02,416 --> 00:54:04,622
Are you sure?

547
00:54:15,346 --> 00:54:19,474
Honey, I was supposed to go over
to the campus and pick up some work.

548
00:54:19,683 --> 00:54:22,388
I'm concerned about leaving you alone.

549
00:54:24,772 --> 00:54:27,014
I'll be about 20 minutes.
Trevor?

550
00:54:30,611 --> 00:54:32,651
Where were you last night?

551
00:54:33,489 --> 00:54:35,944
I was here. Fast asleep.

552
00:54:36,158 --> 00:54:38,198
I thought you were with Bernadette.

553
00:54:42,081 --> 00:54:45,247
Look, honey, I'm gonna stand by you.

554
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:48,249
We're gonna get through this, OK?

555
00:54:51,048 --> 00:54:53,088
I'll be right back.

556
00:58:14,502 --> 00:58:17,171
Believe in me.

557
00:58:17,379 --> 00:58:19,870
Be my victim.

558
00:58:30,142 --> 00:58:32,182
Please...

559
00:58:34,605 --> 00:58:36,645
Do you believe in me?

560
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:40,734
Keep away from me!
I have the child.

561
00:58:41,862 --> 00:58:44,982
Allow me to take you,
or he will die in your place.

562
00:58:46,826 --> 00:58:48,450
No.

563
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:55,160
Your disbelief destroyed
the faith of my congregation.

564
00:58:55,376 --> 00:58:57,867
Without them, I am nothing.

565
00:58:58,087 --> 00:59:01,041
So I was obliged to come.

566
00:59:01,257 --> 00:59:03,296
And now I must kill you.

567
00:59:05,386 --> 00:59:08,340
Your death will be a tale
to frighten children,

568
00:59:08,556 --> 00:59:11,343
to make lovers
cling closer in their rapture.

569
00:59:13,811 --> 00:59:17,014
Come with me and be immortal.

570
00:59:31,245 --> 00:59:32,324
Helen?

571
00:59:34,165 --> 00:59:36,204
Helen, it's Bernie.

572
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:38,494
Wh...

573
00:59:38,711 --> 00:59:40,750
Bernadette?

574
00:59:43,757 --> 00:59:45,335
Bernadette, go...

575
00:59:45,551 --> 00:59:47,590
Helen.

576
00:59:49,096 --> 00:59:51,801
Helen, honey, it's Bernadette.
Let me in.

577
00:59:52,016 --> 00:59:54,055
He's here...

578
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:05,945
Bernadette... Go!

579
01:00:06,155 --> 01:00:07,566
Helen!

580
01:00:08,532 --> 01:00:09,943
Helen?

581
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:12,282
Go on! Get out!

582
01:00:15,998 --> 01:00:19,201
Oh, no...
No, no, no...

583
01:00:45,444 --> 01:00:47,353
Trevor...

584
01:00:47,571 --> 01:00:49,694
Trevor, he's here.

585
01:00:49,907 --> 01:00:53,358
He's here. He's... here.

586
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,080
<i>Don't let him kill me.</i>

587
01:01:04,505 --> 01:01:05,501
Trevor?

588
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,015
Trevor!

589
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:20,384
Trevor!

590
01:01:22,189 --> 01:01:23,434
Trevor!

591
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:28,149
Trevor. Trevor!

592
01:01:28,821 --> 01:01:30,730
Hey, hey.
Trevor!

593
01:01:39,373 --> 01:01:41,413
Take her outside.

594
01:01:43,169 --> 01:01:44,164
Trevor...

595
01:01:45,796 --> 01:01:47,836
Hold me, Trevor, please?

596
01:02:10,112 --> 01:02:12,437
<i>Why do you want to live?</i>

597
01:02:13,365 --> 01:02:16,366
<i>If you would learn</i>
<i>just a little from me,</i>

598
01:02:16,577 --> 01:02:19,150
<i>you would not beg to live.</i>

599
01:02:19,371 --> 01:02:21,862
<i>I am rumor.</i>

600
01:02:22,082 --> 01:02:25,333
<i>It is a blessed condition,</i>
<i>believe me.</i>

601
01:02:25,544 --> 01:02:28,118
<i>To be whispered about</i>
<i>at street corners.</i>

602
01:02:28,339 --> 01:02:30,746
<i>To live in other people's dreams</i>

603
01:02:30,966 --> 01:02:33,588
<i>but not to have to be.</i>

604
01:02:35,387 --> 01:02:38,139
<i>Do you understand?</i>

605
01:03:04,667 --> 01:03:08,415
<i>Please, God,</i>
<i>don't let him kill the baby.</i>

606
01:03:34,113 --> 01:03:35,109
Trevor!

607
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:39,148
Trevor?

608
01:03:41,495 --> 01:03:42,491
Trevor!

609
01:03:59,013 --> 01:04:01,052
Where are you going?

610
01:04:01,891 --> 01:04:06,683
You can't leave me here.
I can't defend myself!

611
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:28,495
No...

612
01:04:31,795 --> 01:04:33,622
What do the good know,

613
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:37,006
except what the bad teach them
by their excesses.

614
01:04:37,968 --> 01:04:39,083
Murderer...

615
01:04:39,303 --> 01:04:41,628
Allow me at least a kiss.

616
01:04:41,847 --> 01:04:46,177
Just one exquisite kiss.

617
01:04:46,811 --> 01:04:48,305
Murderer!

618
01:04:48,521 --> 01:04:51,640
Help! He's under the bed!

619
01:04:53,818 --> 01:04:56,059
Bring me 1,000 mills.

620
01:04:56,278 --> 01:04:59,030
He's here. He's under the bed!

621
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:01,780
No... Don't...

622
01:06:05,055 --> 01:06:07,095
She's coming around.
Morning.

623
01:06:08,851 --> 01:06:10,890
I'd like to speak to my husband.

624
01:06:11,103 --> 01:06:13,262
So would I.

625
01:06:13,481 --> 01:06:16,481
There we go.
What time is it?

626
01:06:16,692 --> 01:06:19,527
Where are we going?
We're going to Disneyland.

627
01:06:33,083 --> 01:06:35,206
Clyde, open it up.

628
01:06:35,419 --> 01:06:37,661
Whitley, Clyde, open it up.

629
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:43,291
What were you all doing back there?
A little reading, huh?

630
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:45,466
Freak.

631
01:06:50,059 --> 01:06:52,098
Dr. Burke?
Yes.

632
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:58,229
Ms Lyle, I'm Dr. Burke.

633
01:07:08,661 --> 01:07:12,445
I'd like to speak to my husband.
I'm sure we can arrange a visit.

634
01:07:12,665 --> 01:07:14,704
A visit?

635
01:07:14,917 --> 01:07:16,956
Have I been committed?

636
01:07:22,258 --> 01:07:25,259
Do you really think
these restraints are necessary?

637
01:07:28,389 --> 01:07:30,428
Helen, this...

638
01:07:32,434 --> 01:07:36,183
is a writ of detention
from the state attorney's office.

639
01:07:36,397 --> 01:07:38,389
For the past month...
Month?

640
01:07:38,607 --> 01:07:40,102
Yes.

641
01:07:40,317 --> 01:07:43,936
We've been stabilizing you
on a heavy dosage of Thorazine.

642
01:07:44,155 --> 01:07:47,570
You probably remember
very little, or nothing.

643
01:07:47,783 --> 01:07:51,828
Get me my attorney.
I'm working for your defense.

644
01:07:52,746 --> 01:07:55,700
We have to assess your ability
to stand trial.

645
01:07:56,876 --> 01:08:00,042
Helen, you've been charged
with first-degree murder.

646
01:08:10,431 --> 01:08:13,930
Why don't you tell me
what happened in your apartment?

647
01:08:43,631 --> 01:08:47,842
The night you were admitted,
did the killer appear to you?

648
01:08:48,636 --> 01:08:51,340
<i>Murderer! Murderer!</i>

649
01:08:51,555 --> 01:08:54,342
<i>Murderer! Help me!</i>

650
01:08:57,770 --> 01:09:00,724
<i>He's here! He's under the bed!</i>

651
01:09:03,609 --> 01:09:06,100
I don't understand.

652
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,728
<i>Help! Please! He's here!</i>

653
01:09:08,948 --> 01:09:12,780
<i>Help me! Help me! Please!</i>

654
01:09:12,993 --> 01:09:15,567
That...
<i>He's under the bed...</i>

655
01:09:15,788 --> 01:09:17,994
That's not possible.

656
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:26,670
Bernadette.

657
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:38,390
I'm not capable of that.

658
01:09:44,525 --> 01:09:46,564
No matter what's going wrong,

659
01:09:48,696 --> 01:09:51,697
I know one thing.
That no part of me,

660
01:09:51,907 --> 01:09:55,525
no matter how hidden,
is capable of that.

661
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:05,746
I can prove it.
How?

662
01:10:08,799 --> 01:10:10,341
I can call him.

663
01:10:21,729 --> 01:10:23,768
Candyman, Candyman,

664
01:10:24,982 --> 01:10:27,936
Candyman, Candyman...

665
01:10:38,829 --> 01:10:40,869
Candyman.

666
01:11:15,115 --> 01:11:17,155
You're mine now.

667
01:11:18,577 --> 01:11:23,370
Tonight our congregation
shall witness a new miracle.

668
01:11:25,835 --> 01:11:26,830
Ah...

669
01:11:41,851 --> 01:11:44,176
Dr. Burke?

670
01:11:48,107 --> 01:11:50,146
Dr. Burke?

671
01:11:50,359 --> 01:11:54,226
Dr. Burke, please answer.

672
01:11:55,656 --> 01:11:57,696
Dr. Burke!

673
01:12:27,563 --> 01:12:31,477
<i>Code nine,</i>
<i>Ward B-5, stat.</i>

674
01:12:31,692 --> 01:12:34,148
<i>Code nine,</i>
<i>Ward B-5, stat.</i>

675
01:12:36,906 --> 01:12:38,945
Check the west wing!

676
01:12:40,534 --> 01:12:42,990
All clear!
Right!

677
01:12:43,204 --> 01:12:45,243
Go, go, go!

678
01:12:48,918 --> 01:12:51,622
We have
a direction on this one?

679
01:13:11,774 --> 01:13:14,526
Please be home, Trevor.
Please be home.

680
01:14:12,668 --> 01:14:14,708
Get out of my home.

681
01:14:16,964 --> 01:14:18,791
Trevor!

682
01:14:19,008 --> 01:14:23,052
What's the matter, sweetie pie?
Did you make another little boo-boo?

683
01:14:24,138 --> 01:14:26,177
What are you doing here?

684
01:14:27,349 --> 01:14:29,389
I live here. Remember?

685
01:14:30,519 --> 01:14:32,559
Call the hospital.

686
01:14:35,149 --> 01:14:37,188
Don't touch the phone.

687
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:53,580
What's the matter, Trevor?

688
01:14:55,503 --> 01:14:57,958
Scared of something?

689
01:15:09,892 --> 01:15:11,931
I hate the color scheme.

690
01:15:16,690 --> 01:15:19,894
Were you going to wait
till I got out before you told me?

691
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:21,106
Helen...

692
01:15:23,155 --> 01:15:25,611
You knew I was never coming out,
didn't you?

693
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:29,699
I think we should call the hospital.

694
01:15:32,957 --> 01:15:33,952
OK.

695
01:15:37,753 --> 01:15:38,749
Go on.

696
01:15:40,548 --> 01:15:42,836
Go on.

697
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:45,090
Is that what you wanna do?

698
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:48,510
Call them.

699
01:16:13,914 --> 01:16:15,954
I'm not a murderer.

700
01:16:17,543 --> 01:16:19,582
I'm not...

701
01:16:20,254 --> 01:16:24,086
Trevor, you were all I had left.

702
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:48,278
It's over.

703
01:16:59,877 --> 01:17:03,460
<i>If you'd like to make</i>
<i>a call, hang up and try again.</i>

704
01:17:24,485 --> 01:17:26,810
<i>They will all abandon you.</i>

705
01:17:38,624 --> 01:17:43,001
<i>All you have left</i>
<i>is my desire for you.</i>

706
01:21:32,358 --> 01:21:33,982
Helen...

707
01:21:36,445 --> 01:21:38,485
You came to me.

708
01:21:40,783 --> 01:21:42,822
The child...

709
01:21:45,412 --> 01:21:50,074
We had a deal.
Surrender to me now...

710
01:21:50,292 --> 01:21:52,914
...and he shall be unharmed.

711
01:22:04,807 --> 01:22:07,927
We have a bargain.
But I'm afraid.

712
01:22:08,144 --> 01:22:11,228
Do you fear the pain,
or what is beyond?

713
01:22:11,438 --> 01:22:12,434
Both.

714
01:22:12,648 --> 01:22:16,860
The pain, I can assure you,
will be exquisite.

715
01:22:17,069 --> 01:22:20,105
As for our deaths,
there is nothing to fear.

716
01:22:21,699 --> 01:22:25,447
Our names will be written
on a thousand walls,

717
01:22:25,661 --> 01:22:30,240
our crimes told and retold
by our faithful believers.

718
01:22:31,292 --> 01:22:35,336
We shall die together
in front of their very eyes

719
01:22:35,546 --> 01:22:39,330
and give them something
to be haunted by.

720
01:22:40,801 --> 01:22:44,585
Come with me and be immortal.

721
01:22:58,152 --> 01:23:00,191
No!

722
01:23:09,914 --> 01:23:10,909
No...

723
01:23:28,224 --> 01:23:30,263
Shh.

724
01:23:32,895 --> 01:23:34,389
Shh.

725
01:23:34,605 --> 01:23:36,977
You're mine now.

726
01:23:37,191 --> 01:23:40,774
It's time for a new miracle.

727
01:25:02,443 --> 01:25:05,563
<i>It was always you, Helen.</i>

728
01:25:05,779 --> 01:25:07,819
<i>It was always you.</i>

729
01:26:25,067 --> 01:26:26,811
He's here.

730
01:27:00,895 --> 01:27:02,223
I'm coming.

731
01:27:08,777 --> 01:27:11,565
- It's OK.
- Check it out, man.

732
01:27:14,158 --> 01:27:16,827
Oh... Yes.

733
01:27:18,996 --> 01:27:21,119
What happened?

734
01:27:21,332 --> 01:27:25,626
Candyman's in there.
I saw him go in there. I saw his hook.

735
01:27:25,836 --> 01:27:29,371
Candyman's in there!
I saw his hook!

736
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:31,629
Shh.

737
01:27:34,887 --> 01:27:36,926
I knew you'd come.

738
01:27:38,933 --> 01:27:40,047
Burn him.

739
01:27:45,314 --> 01:27:46,310
Hush.

740
01:27:46,524 --> 01:27:50,391
Burn him! Burn him! Burn him!

741
01:27:52,822 --> 01:27:54,861
Burn him!

742
01:27:56,826 --> 01:27:58,617
Help!

743
01:27:58,828 --> 01:28:01,663
Burn! Burn! Burn!

744
01:28:01,872 --> 01:28:04,114
Help! Help me!

745
01:28:07,878 --> 01:28:10,250
You lied to me.

746
01:28:10,464 --> 01:28:13,916
We must be on our way now,
you and I.

747
01:28:14,135 --> 01:28:16,886
Our bones will soon be ashes,

748
01:28:17,096 --> 01:28:20,263
and we shall never be separated again.

749
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:22,760
Let me go.

750
01:28:22,977 --> 01:28:26,677
I cannot.
We are already dead.

751
01:28:35,739 --> 01:28:39,986
Helen!

752
01:29:11,692 --> 01:29:13,649
Come back to me!

753
01:29:25,372 --> 01:29:27,080
Come back!

754
01:30:37,319 --> 01:30:39,775
We commend to Almighty God
our sister Helen

755
01:30:39,989 --> 01:30:42,112
and commit her body to the ground.

756
01:30:42,324 --> 01:30:44,650
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

757
01:30:44,869 --> 01:30:46,908
dust to dust.

758
01:30:47,121 --> 01:30:51,415
The Lord bless her and keep her
and give her peace.

759
01:30:51,625 --> 01:30:56,038
God of holiness and power, accept our
prayers on behalf of your servant Helen.

760
01:30:56,255 --> 01:30:58,294
Do not call her deeds against her,

761
01:30:58,507 --> 01:31:01,674
for in her heart
she desired to do your will.

762
01:31:01,886 --> 01:31:06,797
Almighty God, bless you, the Father
and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

763
01:31:15,566 --> 01:31:17,605
My God.
Look at that.

764
01:31:20,112 --> 01:31:22,152
Trevor?

765
01:32:36,313 --> 01:32:38,353
Trevor?

766
01:32:38,983 --> 01:32:41,604
What is it?

767
01:32:41,819 --> 01:32:45,567
Trevor, are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

768
01:32:47,449 --> 01:32:49,489
Aren't you hungry?

769
01:32:50,953 --> 01:32:53,361
No, I'm OK. I'll eat later.

770
01:32:53,581 --> 01:32:56,535
I was gonna make us a nice dinner.

771
01:32:56,750 --> 01:32:58,790
OK. Whatever.

772
01:33:42,463 --> 01:33:44,788
Hey, why don't you help me
make the salad?

773
01:33:46,425 --> 01:33:48,501
OK. I'll be there in a minute.

774
01:34:10,115 --> 01:34:12,155
Oh, Helen...

775
01:34:17,206 --> 01:34:19,245
Helen...

776
01:34:25,005 --> 01:34:27,045
Helen.

777
01:34:32,638 --> 01:34:34,429
Helen.

778
01:34:35,266 --> 01:34:36,760
Ow!

779
01:34:41,147 --> 01:34:44,231
What's the matter, Trevor?

780
01:34:44,441 --> 01:34:46,481
Scared of something?

781
01:34:55,703 --> 01:34:57,945
Trevor...

782
01:34:58,164 --> 01:35:00,203
My God, Trevor?

783
01:35:00,958 --> 01:35:02,369
Trevor?

784
01:35:03,460 --> 01:35:04,919
Trevor?
