1
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,875
<i>They will say</i>
<i>that I have shed innocent blood.</i>

2
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,111
<i>What's blood for</i>

3
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,356
<i>if not for shedding?</i>

4
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,469
<i>With my hook for a hand,</i>

5
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,992
<i>I'll split you from your groin</i>
<i>to your gullet.</i>

6
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,515
<i>I came for you.</i>

7
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,549
It's the scariest story
I have ever heard, and it's true.

8
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,309
<i>It happened a few years ago</i>
<i>near Moses Lake in Indiana.</i>

9
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,875
<i>Clara was babysitting for the Johnsons.</i>

10
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,356
<i>And Billy pulls up on his motorcycle.</i>

11
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,838
<i>She wasn't going out with Billy</i>
<i>but with Michael for about six months.</i>

12
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,160
<i>But she always had the hots for Billy</i>
<i>cos he was like, a bad boy.</i>

13
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,079
<i>And Michael was just... so nice.</i>

14
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,590
<i>So, anyway,</i>
<i>she decides that tonight's the night</i>

15
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,031
<i>that she's gonna give Billy</i>
<i>what she never gave to Michael.</i>

16
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,232
- Have you ever heard of Candyman?
- No.

17
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,716
Well, his right hand is sawn off.

18
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,753
He has a hook
jammed in the bloody stump.

19
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,233
And if you look in the mirror
and you say his name five times,

20
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,077
he'll appear behind you
breathing down your neck.

21
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,236
You wanna try it?

22
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,916
<i>So Billy began.</i>

23
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,510
<i>- He looked in the mirror and he said...</i>
- Candyman.

24
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,556
Candyman.

25
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,356
Candyman.

26
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,716
Candyman.

27
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,116
No one ever got past four.

28
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,030
Not here.

29
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,755
Go downstairs.
I have a surprise for you.

30
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,152
<i>She looked in the mirror and,</i>
<i>I don't know why,</i>

31
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,669
<i>but she said his name the last time.</i>

32
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,836
Candyman.

33
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,996
<i>She turned out the lights...</i>

34
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,360
What he saw
turned his hair white from shock.

35
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,915
Killed her, split her open with his hook

36
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,509
and then killed the baby too.

37
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,280
Billy got away, but

38
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,436
soon after, he went crazy.

39
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,189
My roommate's boyfriend knows him.

40
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,309
So, when did you first hear this story?

41
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,273
My friend heard it on the radio.
It's sick.

42
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,359
The babysitter just roasted the kid,
like it was a turkey or something.

43
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,718
So, what's the deal? You guys doing
a page on serial killers or something?

44
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,515
- Something like that.
- That's it. We're done.

45
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,472
- All right.
- Thanks.

46
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,999
No problem.

47
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,679
- See ya.
- See ya.

48
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,799
See ya.

49
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,070
They get younger every day.

50
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,154
Does anybody remember
the craze for pet baby alligators?

51
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,796
When they got big,
people flushed them down the toilet.

52
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,913
They live in the sewers now.
Some of them are 30 feet long.

53
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,076
Where did this happen?

54
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,750
Miami. They went blind
from living in the dark.

55
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,829
It wasn't Miami, it was New York.
I read it in the paper.

56
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,112
Then it must be true.

57
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,030
Why would Danny and Diane both
be suffering from the same delusion

58
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,231
in two cities 1,000 miles apart?

59
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,479
Let's face it, folks.
There are no alligators in the sewers.

60
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,549
No, it's round the campfire,
it's bedtime stories.

61
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,311
These stories are modern, oral folklore.

62
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,036
They are the unselfconscious reflection
of the fears of urban society.

63
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,595
That's lunch.

64
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,632
... primordial reptile.

65
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,796
It's a monster, right? Why?

66
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,795
Ouch. Ooh. Eugh.

67
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,912
- Ah, the dashing professor.
- The lovely wife.

68
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,951
Hello.

69
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,598
Helen, the crème de la crème.
Harold, Diane, Daniel, Stacey.

70
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,756
- Hi.
- Hello.

71
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,751
Keep up the good work.
Thanks for your contributions.

72
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,837
- Thanks. Bye.
- See you.

73
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,595
Bye.

74
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,269
See ya.

75
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,751
So you wanna tell me about this girl?
What's her name? Stacey.

76
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,112
She could barely look me in the eyes,
Trevor, and I swear she was blushing.

77
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,596
Well, I guess that's because
she's madly in love with me.

78
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,360
All those bursting adolescent hormones.

79
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,510
- You don't really think...
- No, of course not.

80
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,508
Good. I should hope not.
So, what's the matter?

81
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,232
Trevor...

82
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,910
You said you wouldn't do urban legends
until next semester.

83
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,716
You knew Bernadette and I were gathering
data. Why did you have to ruin it?

84
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,276
Honey, you can't expect me
to hold up their education

85
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,119
while the two of you
complete your thesis.

86
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,914
- I have a curriculum to follow.
- Yes, I know.

87
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,839
Well? So don't be mad at me.

88
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,035
<i>If you look in the</i>
<i>mirror and say his name five times,</i>

89
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,993
<i>he'll appear behind you</i>
<i>breathing down your neck.</i>

90
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,438
- Can I clean the room?
- Oh, sure. Don't mind me.

91
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,950
<i>So Billy began.</i>
<i>He looked in the mirror and he said,</i>

92
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,550
<i>"Candyman, Candyman, Candyman..."</i>

93
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,836
Candyman, huh?

94
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,077
- Have you heard of him?
- Mm-hmm. You doin' a study on him?

95
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,991
Yes, I am. What have you heard?

96
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,317
Everybody's scared of him
once it gets dark.

97
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,876
He live over at Cabrini.
My friend told me about him.

98
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,674
- Cabrini-Green?
- Yeah, in the projects.

99
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,668
I don't know too much about it,
but my friend, she know all about it.

100
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,836
Her cousin live at Cabrini.

101
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,349
They say he killed a lady.

102
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,869
- Can I talk to you friend?
- Sure.

103
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,749
- Kitty?
- Yeah? What do you want?

104
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,873
- Lady down here wanna talk to you.
- All right.

105
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,996
She comin'.

106
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,755
I'm Helen Lyle.

107
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,030
Pleased to meet you.
Henrietta Mosely.

108
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,196
- And this is Kitty Culver.
- Hello.

109
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,876
Tell her about the Candyman.

110
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,108
All I know was there was some lady
in a tub, and she heard a noise.

111
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,313
- Do you remember her name?
- I think her name was Ruthie Jean.

112
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,718
She heard this bangin' like somebody
was tryin' to make a hole in the wall.

113
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,311
So Ruthie called 911 and said there's
somebody comin' through the walls.

114
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,397
They didn't believe her.

115
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,556
- They thought she was crazy.
- Mm-hm.

116
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,878
So she called 911 again,
and they still didn't believe her.

117
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,197
When they finally got there,
she was dead.

118
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,790
- Was she shot?
- No...

119
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,675
Um, she was killed with a hook.

120
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,549
It's true.
Yeah, it is.

121
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,877
I read it in the papers.
Candyman killed her.

122
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,519
Yeah, but I don't know
nothin' about that.

123
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,119
This is sick.
This isn't a fairytale.

124
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,675
A woman got killed here. Jesus.

125
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,155
That's not the half of it.

126
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,712
That's Cabrini-Green,
not that you'd recognize it.

127
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,388
No kidding.
I won't even drive past there.

128
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,512
- A kid got shot there the other day.
- Every day.

129
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,473
Look carefully at this picture.

130
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,636
And then this one.

131
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,516
You spot it?

132
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,879
No.

133
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,551
That's not Cabrini-Green.
That's this building, Lincoln Village.

134
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,320
My apartment was built
as a housing project.

135
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,635
- No?
- Yeah.

136
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,796
Now take a look at this.

137
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,390
The city realized there was no barrier
between here and the Gold Coast.

138
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,115
Unlike the highway and the El train
to keep the ghetto cut off.

139
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,709
Exactly.
So they made some alterations.

140
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,596
They covered the cinder block in plaster
and sold the lot off as condos.

141
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,588
- How much did you pay for this place?
- Don't ask.

142
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,276
Now wait till you see this.

143
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,676
Here's the proof.

144
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,196
The killer, or killers,

145
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,389
they don't know which, smashed through
the back of this cabinet.

146
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,556
See, there's no wall there.

147
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,150
Only a medicine chest
separates us from the other apartment.

148
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,114
There could be somebody on the toilet!

149
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,630
- The apartment's vacant.
- Are you sure?

150
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,033
There.

151
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,836
OK. Now take a look.

152
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,789
That is amazing.

153
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,230
- What?
- I saw a light go on.

154
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,396
There's nobody there.

155
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,876
- Psyche.
- That's not funny.

156
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,909
- You didn't scare me at all.
- Yeah, right.

157
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,314
You don't believe all
that nonsense, do you?

158
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,590
I don't. Do you?

159
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,755
No.

160
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,679
All right.

161
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,952
Candyman, Candyman, Candyman,

162
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,116
Candyman...

163
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,916
Candyman.

164
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,836
Oh, you chicken!

165
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,235
You have to do it five times.
Go again.

166
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,075
Trevor?

167
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,638
- Oh, Trevor!
- What? Who were you expecting?

168
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,189
- What time is it?
- It's late, and I'm smashed.

169
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,236
Sorry I scared you.

170
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,992
What's with the arsenal?
We're only going eight blocks.

171
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,273
- You got us dressed up like cops.
- I just said dress conservatively.

172
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,755
No, we look like cops.

173
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,394
- Why are you trying to scare me?
- I'm not.

174
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,957
I just want you to know the gangs
hold this whole neighborhood hostage.

175
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,636
OK, let's just turn around.

176
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,230
We can write a boring thesis
regurgitating all the usual crap

177
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,318
about urban legend.

178
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,632
We've got a real shot here, Bernadette.

179
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,630
A community attributes the daily horrors
of their lives to a mythical figure.

180
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,117
If Trevor and Archie were here,
would they chicken out?

181
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,073
- In a second.
- Exactly.

182
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,116
All right.

183
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,238
- You wanna wait here for me?
- No.

184
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,396
Well, then let's go.

185
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,079
- Check 'em out.
- Lock the car.

186
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,751
Hey, now.

187
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,952
Want somethin', baby?
I got it for you.

188
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,116
Say, yo, mama.
Come on, baby.

189
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,549
Yo, baby.

190
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,473
- Which way you goin'?
- Just going inside.

191
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,033
Yeah?

192
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,389
- You can't come up in here.
- Who you lookin' for?

193
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,956
- Just going up to see a friend.
- Sure you're not the police?

194
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,116
Look like Five-O to me.

195
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,876
Ask blondie where she goin'.

196
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,870
- Who you goin' to see?
- Let's take the stairs. Come on.

197
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,036
Where you all goin' there?

198
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:50,353
Heads up, people.
Five-O comin' up the back door. Police!

199
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,398
It's OK. They think we're cops.
They're not going to follow us.

200
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,436
Hang on.

201
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,196
- Look at this.
- This is great.

202
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,596
"Sweets to..."

203
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,640
- "The sweet."
- "Sweets to the sweet."

204
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,593
- Hurry up, Helen.
- Lemme get the door.

205
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,316
- Sorry.
- Jesus, Helen.

206
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,869
- Here it is.
- Don't go in there.

207
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,236
Come on.

208
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,556
Jesus, it stinks.

209
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,232
I was right.
The layout is identical.

210
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,159
Which means that the bathroom
is over there.

211
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,430
- Helen...
- What's the problem?

212
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,596
A woman died in there.
Leave it.

213
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,190
It's all right.
There's nothing to see.

214
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,600
- Wait.
- This is where he broke through, right?

215
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,755
Yeah.

216
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,597
- Well, we found it. Let's go.
- Wait a second.

217
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,236
OK. Hang onto this.

218
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,271
I'm just gonna go through.

219
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,948
- Then we're outta here.
- You're kidding.

220
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,593
It's a derelict apartment.

221
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,519
What if somebody's
packing drugs in there?

222
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,030
You gonna apologize
and give 'em your card? Huh?

223
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,196
All right. Let's listen.

224
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,757
- There's nobody in there.
- OK.

225
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,916
Hurry up. Be careful.

226
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,796
Give me the camera.

227
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,230
- You got five minutes.
- OK. Five.

228
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,589
Damn it.

229
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,910
Bernadette! Sorry.

230
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,554
- I ran out of film. I gotta go back.
- No way.

231
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,433
- You can't...
- No, way, Helen. We're outta here!

232
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,152
Hey, what y'all doin' in there?

233
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,590
We're just leaving.

234
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,191
- You here for the sweets?
- No. We're not cops.

235
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,790
- We're from the university.
- You don't belong here, lady.

236
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,719
Goin' through people's apartments
and things.

237
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,593
My name is Helen Lyle.
This is Bernadette Walsh.

238
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:29,032
We're doing a thesis, and we were
wondering if we could talk to you.

239
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,796
Here. This is my card.

240
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,916
My baby.

241
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,156
Come on. Let's go.

242
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,070
Whites don't ever come here,
'cept to cause us a problem.

243
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,840
Believe me, that's not
what we want to do.

244
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,596
Let's go in.

245
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,076
So you're doing a study?

246
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,791
What you gonna say?
That we're bad? Hmm?

247
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,117
We steal? We gang-bang?

248
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,676
We all on drugs, right?

249
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,839
We ain't all like
them assholes downstairs.

250
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,716
I just wanna raise my child good.

251
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,999
- He's a beautiful little boy.
- He's all I got.

252
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,158
- What's his name?
- Anthony.

253
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,758
I'm Anne-Marie.

254
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,113
Anne-Marie McCoy.

255
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,754
- Nice to meet you.
- Sorry we disturbed you.

256
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,236
- We'll just get out of your way.
- It's OK.

257
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,476
I don't mean to be rude. It's...

258
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,036
You know, the white folks
that come round here

259
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,196
ain't too handshakin' with us.

260
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,070
- Hey, what you doin'?
- Let me help you.

261
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,596
Making a mess here, huh?

262
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,756
Thank you. Thanks.

263
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,876
- You got kids?
- No, but I'd love one.

264
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,798
Hey...

265
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,195
Got my eye on this one, big time.

266
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,551
Yeah.
They're not gonna get him.

267
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,273
You wanna know about Ruthie Jean?

268
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,278
They all been here, you know?
Newspapers, cops.

269
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,359
Case workers. They all wanna know.

270
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,076
I heard her screamin'.

271
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,228
I heard her right through the walls.

272
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,271
I dialed 911.
Nobody came.

273
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,399
Nobody came.
Everybody scared.

274
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,998
He come right through these walls,
you know?

275
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,556
I-I'm scared.

276
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,876
Scared for my child.

277
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,716
- They ain't never gonna catch him.
- Who?

278
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,513
Candyman.

279
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,557
If they saw something they liked,
they'd point.

280
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,320
They thought it was rude to point.

281
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,990
- What did they do?
- They went...

282
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,760
Spat over people.
Quite extraordinary.

283
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,833
- Be nice.
- I am being nice.

284
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,828
So how are the two most beautiful
graduate students getting along?

285
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,476
Trevor tells me you've been dabbling
in my favorite subject.

286
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,596
I can't wait to review your data.
I can fit you in tomorrow.

287
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,394
We're not ready yet.

288
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,354
That's the moment at which
I can be of greatest assistance.

289
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,439
Before you disappear down a path
to academic oblivia.

290
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,359
I think I've been there.

291
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,711
Actually, Purcell,
we're about to bury you.

292
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,718
- Helen...
- What?

293
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,670
We'll have something for you soon.

294
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,556
- We only went to Cabrini today, and...
- Ah! Cabrini-Green.

295
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,556
Candyman country.

296
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:34,114
If you're after the hook man, read the
paper I wrote about him ten years ago.

297
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,834
You do know the story, don't you?

298
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,475
No...

299
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,396
Then how are you going to bury me?

300
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,712
The legend first appeared in 1890.

301
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,475
Candyman was the son of a slave.

302
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,952
His father had amassed a considerable
fortune from designing a device

303
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,038
for the mass-producing of shoes
after the Civil War.

304
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,229
Candyman had been
sent to the best schools

305
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,396
and had grown up in polite society.

306
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,718
He had a prodigious talent
as an artist

307
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,830
and was much sought after when it came
to the documenting of one's wealth

308
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,679
and position in society in a portrait.

309
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,118
It was in this latter capacity

310
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,959
that he was commissioned
by a wealthy landowner

311
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,833
to capture
his daughter's virginal beauty.

312
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,829
Well, of course,
they fell deeply in love,

313
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,759
and she became pregnant.

314
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,631
Hmph.

315
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,796
Poor Candyman.

316
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,557
The father executed
a terrible revenge.

317
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,559
He paid a pack of brutal hooligans
to do the deed.

318
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,831
They chased Candyman
through the town to Cabrini-Green,

319
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,596
where they proceeded to saw off
his right hand with a rusty blade.

320
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,398
No one came to his aid.

321
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,319
But this was just the beginning
of his ordeal.

322
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:28,152
Nearby there was an apiary. Dozens
of hives, filled with hungry bees.

323
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,156
They smashed the hives
and stole the honeycomb...

324
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,477
...and smeared it
over his prone, naked body.

325
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,756
Candyman was stung to death
by the bees.

326
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,193
<i>They burned his body</i>
<i>on a giant pyre</i>

327
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,153
<i>and then scattered his ashes</i>
<i>over Cabrini-Green.</i>

328
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,555
Hello.

329
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,879
Anne-Marie ain't in.

330
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,713
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. She said you'd be back.

331
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,396
What's your name?

332
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,953
Jake.

333
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,520
Well, listen, Jake,
maybe you can help me out.

334
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,996
I wanted to find out
about that woman who got killed.

335
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,555
Do you know anything about that?

336
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,432
Her name was Ruthie Jean.

337
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,515
I don't know nothin'.

338
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,517
Did anybody else talk about it?

339
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,911
It's OK to talk to me, Jake.

340
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,596
Cos I'm not a cop.

341
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,109
- So nobody's gonna get in trouble.
- I can't say nothin',

342
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,276
or Candyman'll get me.

343
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,556
Candyman, huh?

344
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,711
You scared of him?

345
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,036
I ain't scared of nobody.

346
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,198
But you're crazy
walkin' here on your own.

347
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,278
- It ain't safe around here.
- Yeah, I know.

348
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,153
But I don't scare
too easy either, Jake.

349
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,393
You know, you don't have to tell me.

350
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,556
You could just show me.

351
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,919
And if you show me where Candyman is,
I'll make you a promise.

352
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,716
It'll be our secret.

353
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,276
Unless you're too scared.

354
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:03,150
- Somebody building a bonfire?
- Yeah, for the party.

355
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,991
In there.

356
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,112
- Candyman's in there?
- My friend Charlie says so.

357
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,709
A boy got killed there.

358
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,956
- Who was he?
- Ain't sure.

359
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,071
Charlie tell me he was weird.

360
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,272
- He was crazy?
- No, a retard.

361
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,356
His mom was in the store.

362
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,234
And the boy
needed to go to the bathroom.

363
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,388
His mom was takin' her time,
choosin' this, lookin' at that.

364
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,672
So the boy started moanin'.
His mom get mad at him.

365
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,632
Sent him across the street.

366
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,310
His mom's at the checkout.
She hears her boy screamin'.

367
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,398
Mommy! Mommy!

368
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,752
There's a big tough guy.
He runs over to check it out.

369
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,868
<i>Come out of there shakin' and cryin'.</i>

370
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,589
He only been in there five seconds.

371
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,836
Come out of there
and his hair turned white.

372
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,950
I mean, it turned white, just like that.

373
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,592
Was the boy murdered?

374
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:30,715
Worse. He's lyin' on the floor
in a pool of blood, holdin' himself.

375
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:35,072
Mommy! Mommy!

376
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,874
They found it floating in a toilet.

377
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,913
Can't fix that. Better off dead.

378
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,878
Did Candyman do this?

379
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,157
- Listen, you wait here for me, OK?
- OK.

380
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,995
Hello?

381
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,392
Candyman.

382
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,076
Oh, excuse me.

383
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,669
I'm done here.
I'll just get out of your way.

384
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,428
I don't want to interfere
with your business.

385
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,349
I'm not a cop.
I'm from the University of Illinois.

386
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,715
And...
I'll just get out of your way.

387
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,229
Hey, come on! Let me go!

388
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,396
You're not being very smart.

389
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,353
My colleagues know where I am
and are expecting me.

390
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,993
Now let me go!

391
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,838
I hear you're lookin'
for Candyman, bitch.

392
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,231
Well, you found him.

393
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,679
We hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

394
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,836
Step back.

395
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,308
Number four,
step forward and say the line.

396
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,273
We hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

397
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,436
Step back.

398
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,189
Number five,
step forward and say the line.

399
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,868
We hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

400
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,036
Step back. Take 'em out.

401
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,720
- Number five.
- Good work.

402
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,352
- How'd you catch him?
- We swept the place.

403
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,551
Start from the top floor, work down.

404
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,830
That way you can flush them all out.

405
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,156
Whole of Cabrini's locked down now.

406
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,874
You're lucky to be alive, Ms Lyle.

407
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,912
- Did he kill Ruthie Jean?
- No question.

408
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,477
Killed that poor kid as well.
He ran the Overlords.

409
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,875
We knew everything about him.

410
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:56,198
We didn't bring him in before
because no one would testify.

411
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,870
We can't protect them down
at Cabrini-Green. They knew that.

412
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,796
What about the little boy? Jake?

413
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,434
We don't need him. We have you.

414
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,396
Hey, Jake.

415
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,074
I wanted to thank you
for saving my life.

416
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,829
- I wanna go home.
- We'll get you outta here right away.

417
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,033
- You did good.
- You said it was our secret.

418
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,198
- You lied.
- It still is, Jake.

419
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,789
You won't have to go to court.

420
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,319
Candyman will get me.

421
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,398
Candyman isn't real.

422
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,830
He's just a story.

423
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,191
You know, like Dracula or Frankenstein.

424
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,076
A bad man took his name
so he could scare us.

425
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,953
Now he's locked up.
Everything's gonna be OK.

426
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,276
Candyman ain't real?

427
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,359
No.

428
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,714
- Hey!
- Slow down!

429
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,595
- You're supposed to be the invalid.
- No, it's better. Look. See?

430
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,110
- Yeah, it looks great.
- Come and sit.

431
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,791
- You haven't eaten already, have you?
- No, of course not.

432
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,669
OK, good.

433
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,274
Hey, welcome back.

434
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,156
- Thanks.
- Let me see.

435
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,633
I'm so glad you're OK.
I would've totally freaked.

436
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,913
You know what bugs me? Two people
get murdered, and the cops do nothing.

437
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,192
A white woman's attacked,
and they lock the place down.

438
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,595
Yeah, I know,
but this was a bad guy.

439
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,190
You got him put away.
That's all that matters.

440
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,834
Oh! I've got a surprise for you.

441
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,508
- What?
- You're not gonna believe it.

442
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,629
- The pictures.
- A friend of mine saved most of them.

443
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,112
I'd written them off.
The camera was smashed.

444
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,118
And I've been talking
to some publishers.

445
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,756
There's a lot of interest
since you made the local section.

446
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,996
We're gonna be published.

447
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,953
I'll come over tomorrow,
and we'll get started.

448
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,116
- Yeah.
- OK.

449
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,876
Helen...

450
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,914
Yes.

451
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,076
Helen...

452
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,112
Who is that?

453
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,152
Who is that?

454
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,759
Helen...

455
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,916
I came for you.

456
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,393
Do I know you?

457
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,079
No...

458
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,750
No, but you doubted me.

459
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,111
- I'm sorry. I have to go.
- No need to leave yet.

460
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,710
But I'm late.

461
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,753
You are not content
with the stories,

462
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,758
so I was obliged to come.

463
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,278
Be my victim.

464
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,796
Be my victim.

465
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,157
I am the writing on the wall,

466
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,158
the whisper in the classroom.

467
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,830
Without these things,
I am nothing.

468
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,316
So now I must shed innocent blood.

469
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,874
Come with me.

470
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,953
Anthony!

471
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,038
Anthony!

472
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,716
No, no! No...

473
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,958
Anthony! No!

474
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,988
- Anne-Marie?
- No! You bitch! You bitch!

475
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,236
- Stay back!
- Where's my baby?

476
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,956
My baby!
You murderer! You...

477
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,996
Please, stop!

478
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,756
Now, stop! Stop!

479
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,313
Police! Open up!

480
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,637
Hold it right there!
Back away! Now!

481
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,159
Look out, look out!

482
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,192
Remove your sweater.

483
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,756
Drop it and slide it over to me.

484
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,716
Take off your brassiere.

485
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,276
Can I please take a shower?

486
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,476
Oh, God...

487
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,391
Drop it and slide it over to me.

488
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,516
Lift up your arms.

489
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,996
Lift your left breast.

490
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,196
Your right.

491
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,159
Remove your underwear.

492
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:47,239
Can I please speak
with Detective Valento?

493
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,396
Remove your underwear.

494
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,835
Frank...

495
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,077
Ms Lyle, you're under arrest.
Do you understand?

496
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,275
- Please let me explain.
- Do you understand?

497
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,553
- Yes, but...
- You have the right to remain silent.

498
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,955
Do you understand?

499
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,230
- This is crazy. I was attacked.
- Respond to the question!

500
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,150
I understand.

501
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:36,196
At approximately 10pm, Anne-Marie McCoy
returned to her apartment.

502
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,836
She discovered her dog
with its head cut off.

503
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:45,309
She cried for assistance, at which point
you attacked her with a meat cleaver.

504
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,159
You were still in possession
of this weapon

505
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,794
when the arresting officers
came to her aid.

506
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,916
Where's the baby?

507
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,838
- I-I don't know.
- You're sick.

508
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,959
Before any further questions,
would you like to have counsel?

509
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,196
Yes or no?

510
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,033
I-I-I would like to make a phone call.

511
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,355
<i>We can't take your call.</i>
<i>Leave a message after the tone.</i>

512
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,476
Trevor, are you there? Pick up.

513
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,714
It's an emergency, Trevor.
Pick up the phone.

514
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,555
<i>I've been arrested.</i>
<i>I'm at the 18th District.</i>

515
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,432
<i>Can you please come pick me up?</i>

516
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,596
That's it.

517
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,236
Do you know what time it is?

518
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,353
3am.

519
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:47,795
Oh, God.

520
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:51,277
There's gotta be another way out.

521
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,677
Cover her face.
Don't say anything. Walk to the car.

522
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,233
OK.

523
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,198
You'll be fine. Stick with me.

524
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:05,110
- There she is!
- Just keep your head down.

525
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,836
- Right here!
- Back off!

526
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,998
Back off. We have no comment.
Nothing to say.

527
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,156
We have absolutely nothing to say.

528
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,715
My client has not been charged
with a thing.

529
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,876
<i>...information has indicated</i>

530
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:25,550
<i>that baby Anthony was abducted</i>
<i>and may still be alive.</i>

531
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,876
<i>The blood may have come from the dog.</i>

532
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,674
<i>A suspect was released</i>
<i>after questioning,</i>

533
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,475
<i>and I guess we'll just have to</i>
<i>follow this one as it devel...</i>

534
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:39,231
Well, at least they didn't
mention your name. That's good.

535
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,149
They haven't charged you because
they think they'll find the body.

536
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,396
They're shooting for murder one,

537
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,830
but I don't think
they have a chance.

538
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,670
- Do you think I did it?
- No, nobody believes that.

539
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,876
But it's crossed your mind?

540
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,475
Is there anything,
any detail, however small,

541
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,878
that you can recall that would help us
substantiate your version of events?

542
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,072
I-I blacked out.
I mean, I...

543
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,748
I don't know what happened.

544
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:25,236
I just woke up in that place,
and there was blood everywhere.

545
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,510
Can I get you anything?

546
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,476
Are you sure?

547
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:04,719
Honey, I was supposed to go over
to the campus and pick up some work.

548
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,514
I'm concerned about leaving you alone.

549
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,950
- I'll be about 20 minutes.
- Trevor?

550
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,356
Where were you last night?

551
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,515
I was here. Fast asleep.

552
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,676
I thought you were with Bernadette.

553
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,437
Look, honey, I'm gonna stand by you.

554
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,316
We're gonna get through this, OK?

555
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,956
I'll be right back.

556
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,680
Believe in me.

557
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,269
Be my victim.

558
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,076
Please...

559
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,356
Do you believe in me?

560
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,278
- Keep away from me!
- I have the child.

561
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,352
Allow me to take you,
or he will die in your place.

562
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,678
No.

563
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,113
Your disbelief destroyed
the faith of my congregation.

564
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,709
Without them, I am nothing.

565
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,753
So I was obliged to come.

566
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,916
And now I must kill you.

567
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,753
Your death will be a tale
to frighten children,

568
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,633
to make lovers
cling closer in their rapture.

569
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,072
Come with me and be immortal.

570
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,755
Helen?

571
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,476
Helen, it's Bernie.

572
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,672
Wh...

573
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,836
Bernadette?

574
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,233
Bernadette, go...

575
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,396
Helen.

576
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,434
Helen, honey, it's Bernadette.
Let me in.

577
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,596
He's here...

578
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,999
Bernadette... Go!

579
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,553
Helen!

580
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,833
Helen?

581
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,076
Go on! Get out!

582
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,712
Oh, no...
No, no, no...

583
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,711
Trevor...

584
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,956
Trevor, he's here.

585
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:22,470
He's here. He's... here.

586
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,916
<i>Don't let him kill me.</i>

587
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,115
Trevor?

588
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,199
Trevor!

589
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,389
Trevor!

590
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,314
Trevor!

591
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,836
Trevor. Trevor!

592
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,311
- Hey, hey.
- Trevor!

593
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,556
Take her outside.

594
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,195
Trevor...

595
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,716
Hold me, Trevor, please?

596
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:38,310
<i>Why do you want to live?</i>

597
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,078
<i>If you would learn</i>
<i>just a little from me,</i>

598
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,748
<i>you would not beg to live.</i>

599
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,349
<i>I am rumor.</i>

600
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:50,677
<i>It is a blessed condition,</i>
<i>believe me.</i>

601
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,348
<i>To be whispered about</i>
<i>at street corners.</i>

602
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:55,869
<i>To live in other people's dreams</i>

603
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,594
<i>but not to have to be.</i>

604
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,959
<i>Do you understand?</i>

605
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,995
<i>Please, God,</i>
<i>don't let him kill the baby.</i>

606
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,595
Trevor!

607
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,469
Trevor?

608
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:04,675
Trevor!

609
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,476
Where are you going?

610
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:27,876
You can't leave me here.
I can't defend myself!

611
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:48,795
No...

612
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,712
What do the good know,

613
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,957
except what the bad teach them
by their excesses.

614
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:58,949
Murderer...

615
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:01,390
Allow me at least a kiss.

616
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:05,752
Just one exquisite kiss.

617
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,793
Murderer!

618
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,992
Help! He's under the bed!

619
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:15,230
Bring me 1,000 mills.

620
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,079
He's here. He's under the bed!

621
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,716
No... Don't...

622
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,356
She's coming around.
Morning.

623
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,996
I'd like to speak to my husband.

624
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,270
So would I.

625
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:32,358
- There we go.
- What time is it?

626
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:35,279
- Where are we going?
- We're going to Disneyland.

627
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,316
Clyde, open it up.

628
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,670
Whitley, Clyde, open it up.

629
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:58,069
What were you all doing back there?
A little reading, huh?

630
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,155
Freak.

631
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,516
- Dr. Burke?
- Yes.

632
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,396
Ms Lyle, I'm Dr. Burke.

633
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:26,029
- I'd like to speak to my husband.
- I'm sure we can arrange a visit.

634
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,196
A visit?

635
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,356
Have I been committed?

636
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,318
Do you really think
these restraints are necessary?

637
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,276
Helen, this...

638
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,795
is a writ of detention
from the state attorney's office.

639
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,911
- For the past month...
- Month?

640
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,553
Yes.

641
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:56,230
We've been stabilizing you
on a heavy dosage of Thorazine.

642
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:59,716
You probably remember
very little, or nothing.

643
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,799
- Get me my attorney.
- I'm working for your defense.

644
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:07,513
We have to assess your ability
to stand trial.

645
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,677
Helen, you've been charged
with first-degree murder.

646
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:24,996
Why don't you tell me
what happened in your apartment?

647
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:57,519
The night you were admitted,
did the killer appear to you?

648
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,874
<i>Murderer! Murderer!</i>

649
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,753
<i>Murderer! Help me!</i>

650
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,873
<i>He's here! He's under the bed!</i>

651
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,029
I don't understand.

652
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,549
<i>Help! Please! He's here!</i>

653
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,435
<i>Help me! Help me! Please!</i>

654
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:24,108
- That...
<i>- He's under the bed...</i>

655
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,436
That's not possible.

656
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:34,756
Bernadette.

657
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,996
I'm not capable of that.

658
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,836
No matter what's going wrong,

659
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:58,758
I know one thing.
That no part of me,

660
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,430
no matter how hidden,
is capable of that.

661
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:12,232
- I can prove it.
- How?

662
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,639
I can call him.

663
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,516
Candyman, Candyman,

664
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:33,513
Candyman, Candyman...

665
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,916
Candyman.

666
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:20,716
You're mine now.

667
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:26,676
Tonight our congregation
shall witness a new miracle.

668
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:29,995
Ah...

669
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,630
Dr. Burke?

670
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,356
Dr. Burke?

671
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,269
Dr. Burke, please answer.

672
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:59,596
Dr. Burke!

673
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:31,994
<i>Code nine,</i>
<i>Ward B-5, stat.</i>

674
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,555
<i>Code nine,</i>
<i>Ward B-5, stat.</i>

675
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,156
Check the west wing!

676
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:43,035
- All clear!
- Right!

677
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:45,196
Go, go, go!

678
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:51,314
We have
a direction on this one?

679
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,279
Please be home, Trevor.
Please be home.

680
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,996
Get out of my home.

681
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:14,912
Trevor!

682
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:18,999
What's the matter, sweetie pie?
Did you make another little boo-boo?

683
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,996
What are you doing here?

684
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,076
I live here. Remember?

685
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:28,116
Call the hospital.

686
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,556
Don't touch the phone.

687
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,276
What's the matter, Trevor?

688
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:52,475
Scared of something?

689
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,876
I hate the color scheme.

690
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:13,512
Were you going to wait
till I got out before you told me?

691
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:14,675
Helen...

692
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,995
You knew I was never coming out,
didn't you?

693
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,916
I think we should call the hospital.

694
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:26,995
OK.

695
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:31,595
Go on.

696
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,515
Go on.

697
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,676
Is that what you wanna do?

698
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,956
Call them.

699
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:07,276
I'm not a murderer.

700
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,756
I'm not...

701
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:15,075
Trevor, you were all I had left.

702
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,276
It's over.

703
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:52,836
<i>If you'd like to make</i>
<i>a call, hang up and try again.</i>

704
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,230
<i>They will all abandon you.</i>

705
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:30,758
<i>All you have left</i>
<i>is my desire for you.</i>

706
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:12,278
Helen...

707
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,596
You came to me.

708
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,756
The child...

709
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:27,711
- We had a deal.
- Surrender to me now...

710
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,434
...and he shall be unharmed.

711
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,832
- We have a bargain.
- But I'm afraid.

712
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,998
Do you fear the pain,
or what is beyond?

713
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,155
Both.

714
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:53,399
The pain, I can assure you,
will be exquisite.

715
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,512
As for our deaths,
there is nothing to fear.

716
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:01,635
Our names will be written
on a thousand walls,

717
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:06,231
our crimes told and retold
by our faithful believers.

718
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:11,119
We shall die together
in front of their very eyes

719
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:14,949
and give them something
to be haunted by.

720
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:19,989
Come with me and be immortal.

721
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,956
No!

722
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:45,235
No...

723
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,796
Shh.

724
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,753
Shh.

725
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:10,235
You're mine now.

726
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:13,876
It's time for a new miracle.

727
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:35,192
<i>It was always you, Helen.</i>

728
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,356
<i>It was always you.</i>

729
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,112
He's here.

730
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,074
I'm coming.

731
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:36,033
- It's OK.
- Check it out, man.

732
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:41,080
Oh... Yes.

733
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:45,196
What happened?

734
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:49,518
Candyman's in there.
I saw him go in there. I saw his hook.

735
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:53,110
Candyman's in there!
I saw his hook!

736
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:55,276
Shh.

737
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,356
I knew you'd come.

738
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:03,349
Burn him.

739
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,355
Hush.

740
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:13,269
Burn him! Burn him! Burn him!

741
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,556
Burn him!

742
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,158
Help!

743
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:24,079
Burn! Burn! Burn!

744
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:26,430
Help! Help me!

745
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:32,315
You lied to me.

746
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:35,830
We must be on our way now,
you and I.

747
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:38,679
Our bones will soon be ashes,

748
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,917
and we shall never be separated again.

749
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:44,312
Let me go.

750
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:48,069
I cannot.
We are already dead.

751
01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:00,833
Helen!

752
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,117
Come back to me!

753
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:45,998
Come back!

754
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,715
We commend to Almighty God
our sister Helen

755
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,956
and commit her body to the ground.

756
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:00,390
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

757
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,556
dust to dust.

758
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:06,878
The Lord bless her and keep her
and give her peace.

759
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:11,312
God of holiness and power, accept our
prayers on behalf of your servant Helen.

760
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:13,476
Do not call her deeds against her,

761
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:16,717
for in her heart
she desired to do your will.

762
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:21,630
Almighty God, bless you, the Father
and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

763
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:31,996
My God.
Look at that.

764
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,356
Trevor?

765
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:49,436
Trevor?

766
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:52,554
What is it?

767
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:56,355
- Trevor, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

768
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:00,116
Aren't you hungry?

769
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,829
No, I'm OK. I'll eat later.

770
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,873
I was gonna make us a nice dinner.

771
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:09,036
OK. Whatever.

772
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:53,150
Hey, why don't you help me
make the salad?

773
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:56,711
OK. I'll be there in a minute.

774
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:19,396
Oh, Helen...

775
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:26,196
Helen...

776
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:33,676
Helen.

777
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,758
Helen.

778
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:42,993
Ow!

779
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:50,158
What's the matter, Trevor?

780
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:52,316
Scared of something?

781
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:03,310
Trevor...

782
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:05,476
My God, Trevor?

783
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:07,553
Trevor?

784
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:09,999
Trevor?
