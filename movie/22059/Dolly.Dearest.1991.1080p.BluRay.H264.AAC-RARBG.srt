00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,719
估計是 是1點15分左右

5
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,845
你剛剛是不是跟我說了什麼？

6
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:07,426
我沒

7
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,184

我們快到了

9
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,483
不錯

10
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,601
你知道 這是一門丟失的藝術

11
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,627
她的技術已經多年沒有使用過了

12
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,901
結果非常棒

13
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,119
嗯哼

14
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,280
這個給蘇西·貝克

好的

19
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,774
我不知道她有這麼多朋友

20
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,547
她大多都寫了兩次

21
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,763
看這個 甜心

22
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,060
這個娃娃就是

23
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,472
你爸爸要在墨西哥做的娃娃

24
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:51,849
你確定嗎

25
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,751
這是我們要給她做衣服

26
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,981
所使用的工廠

27
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,478
她很漂亮 對吧？

28
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,061
而且你會擁有世界上只有一個

我們會非常成功的

32
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,157
那我們可以回洛杉磯嗎？

33
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:28,340
韋德先生

34
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,891
韋德先生

35
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,343

哦

47
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,604
韋德太太 我們付出了很多努力

卡米拉

準備青辣椒

54
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,566
好的

請帶上手提箱

56
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:19,895
是的 女士

57
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,237
這是卡米拉

她會好好照顧你的

59
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:23,649

00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,031
謝謝你

63
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,825
你好 小韋德的孩子

64
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,270
你的東西已經安全到達了

65
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,941
我現在要幫你打開包裝

66
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,250
請進

67
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,010
很棒的房子

68
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,053
我沒想到會這麼好

69
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,551
你喜歡讀書嗎

70
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,662
這些書里有很多我們國家的歷史

71
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:53,686
真的嗎

72
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,056
傑西？

73
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,168
韋德先生
你想去工廠看看嗎？

74
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,192
我們走

75
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,196
爸爸？

76
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,479
我可以和你一起去嗎？

77
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,985
當然可以
親愛的 來吧

78
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,997
來吧
讓我們看看我們的新業務

79
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,991
沒關係 繼續

80
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,057
我們到了

81
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,162
惡心

82
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,789
德魯加夫人做的娃娃

83
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:44,619
是世界上最好的

84
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,796
她贏得了許多獎項

85
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,486
當我還是個小孩子的時候

86
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,876
我會來這裡只是為了看他們畫小臉

87
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,338
以及她臨死前創造的一個
如此美麗的娃娃

88
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,423
能幫你處理這件事

89
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,258
是我的榮幸 韋德先生

90
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,935
這是我第一次賣東西

91
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,513
埃斯特雷拉先生
評估文件顯示

92
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,143
在德盧加死後

93
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,476
工廠還在繼續運作

94
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:08,821
是的 先生

95
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,155
我們會非常小心地

96
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,611
讓一切保持原樣

97
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,908
這就是為什麼從來都沒有人

98
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,326
來看這個工廠的原因

99
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:23,919
是的

100
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,045
我知道了

101
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,069
Come, let me show you over here

102
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,049
where all the molding
equipment's been stored.

103
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,266
Mr. Estrella,

104
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,849
what's this big,
round mixing thing?

105
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,330
Oh, that is where

106
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,470
they combine all the ingredients

107
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:44,815
to make the deluga dolls.

108
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,666
The future
heartthrob of millions

109
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,008
of little girls.

110
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,131
Once in a lifetime opportunity.

111
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,682
Si, of course, seiior,

112
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,258
I understand that.

113
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,389
We need a little
cleaning, perhaps.

114
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,015
The market projections.

115
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,647
The assessments.

116
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,065
Who prepared that material?

117
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,814
1, 1 did that, sir.

118
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,146
I copy from American
business book.

119
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,158
Nice work.

120
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,114
Jessica, are you in here?

121
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,063
I'm up here, daddy.

122
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,285
Look what I found.

123
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,412
May I have one, daddy?

124
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,373
Oh, look at that.

125
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,458
Fabulous.

126
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,958
Every little girl in the world

127
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,009
is going to want one of those.

128
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,056
I want

129
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,434
that one.

130
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,096
Well, you've got it.

131
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,396
My first sale.

132
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,345
Thank you, daddy.

133
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,569
I'm going to love her so much.

134
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,165
Jimmy!

135
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,918
Uh, Mr. Estrella, what is that?

136
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,335
What's going on over there?

137
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,126
That is Mayan ruins.

138
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,798
They uncover much history
of Mayan civilization.

139
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,171
Very important find.

140
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,011
Mayan, huh?

141
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,963
We studied about
them last semester.

142
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,640
They were pretty cool dudes.

143
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:26,977
Cool or not,

144
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,590
I don't want you
going over there.

145
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,332
Yeah, last week they had
an unfortunate accident.

146
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:30,970
A man was crushed

147
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,477
by a stone underneath the earth.

148
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:34,432
Work's been suspended

149
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:35,391
until the archeologist

150
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,318
from the university arrives.

151
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,655
I'm going to

152
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,239
brush your hair.

153
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,326
So the end of a long day.

154
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,914
Tomorrow we'll all
start unpacking.

155
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,082
Now, won't that be fun?

156
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,580
Probably not.

157
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,545
Good night, sweetheart.

158
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,094
Don't forget
to say good night to Dolly.

159
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,926
Sweet dreams, Dolly.

160
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,362
Good night, Dolly.

161
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,153
You're going to be
my new playmate.

162
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,108
You're going to be
my only playmate.

163
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,098
Mmm, these
vegetables smell good.

164
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,188
These all come from
my brother's garden.

165
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,359
I get you good price, of course.

166
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,436
He uses fresh Turkey manure.

167
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,146
Turkey manure is the very best.

168
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,901
It gives you the best crop.

169
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,243
Really?

170
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:06,741
Mm-hmm.

171
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,078
I didn't know that.

172
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,284
Now, my sister,

173
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,578
she makes us all very proud.

174
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,247
She gave her life to the church.

175
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:18,290
She belongs to the nuns of the
carmelitas, the carmelites.

176
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,086
Really?

177
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,424
Uh-huh.

178
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,338
Mommy!

179
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:22,916
Just leave it on the table

180
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,717
with the other letters, honey.

181
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,217
I wanted to tell
you I'll be in the back yard.

182
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,556
You and I can go play
in the Dollhouse.

183
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,242
Jessie, is that you?

184
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,993
We're almost ready to go, honey.

185
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,563
Is anyone out there?

186
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:53,243
What is it?

187
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,369
Mom, what is it?

188
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:07,876
Jessica!

189
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:08,672
Jessica!

190
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:09,465
Jessica!

191
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,588
Tell me what's wrong.

192
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,669
What's wrong with her?

193
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:22,519
No!

194
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,347
I want Dolly!

195
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,692
Jimmy.

196
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:27,861
Camilla.

197
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:28,734
Camilla?

198
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,436
What is the priest doing here?

199
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,381
I called the priest
to bless the house.

200
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,450
It is custom.

201
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:05,889
Professor resnick.

202
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,234
What?

203
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,004
The photos from
hapalla have arrived.

204
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,484
Ah, at last.

205
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,500
What do you think?
Could this be the tomb?

206
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,001
I'm not sure.

207
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,083
Have you ever seen
this symbol before?

208
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,092
No, sir.

209
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,043
I'm certain it's not Mayan.

210
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,139
They haven't disturbed

211
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,304
the sarcophagus, have they?

212
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,786
No, no one has touched a thing

213
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,090
since larabe's body was removed.

214
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,729
When are you leaving?

215
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:46,648
Bob larabe and I

216
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,097
were friends for over 30 years.

217
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,317
Did you know that?

218
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:50,899
No, sir.

219
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,237
I'm leaving right now.

220
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,159
How is she?

221
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,202
She seems all right.

222
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,995
We had a long talk about her
old playmates at school mostly.

223
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,493
I wish you would
have seen her, Elliot.

224
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:06,870
She scared me,

225
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,917
really scared me.

226
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:09,914
There's no reason for it.

227
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,256
None.

228
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,986
I'm gonna take Jimmy with
me to the factory tomorrow

229
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,966
and give you two
some time together.

230
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:16,759
Good.

231
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,096
That, that would help.

232
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,052
The sewing machines arrive
next week. Did I tell you?

233
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:26,855
Oh, yes.

234
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,023
You told me.

235
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,242
It's a secret.

236
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:54,424
That's funny.

237
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,420
Why are you doing that?

238
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,472
Jessica, what are you doing?

239
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,392
Dolly says we're
going to like it here.

240
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,393
Oh, we are going to
like it here, honey.

241
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:17,895
Now, come on.

242
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,446
Let's go to bed.

243
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,438
Well, it looks like
you're enjoying your lunch.

244
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,608
What is that, honey?

245
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,693
I don't know.

246
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,869
Well, did you see it somewhere?

247
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:14,492
Dolly told me.

248
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,594
She says she's been
waiting for a little girl

249
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,870
just like me.

250
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:21,833
Sweetheart.

251
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,280
Jessica!

252
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:46,406
Jessica, I saw that!

253
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:47,939
Camilla, I am so sorry.

254
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,004
She, I, I don't know
what's gotten into her.

255
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,487
Kinta kintero.

256
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,070
What?

257
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,030
Jessica!

258
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,535
Jessica, come back here!

259
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,124
Camilla, I am terribly sorry.

260
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,456
She's never had outbursts
like this before.

261
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,801
It is the sanzia.

262
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,813
She spoke the ancient
language of the sanzia.

263
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,242
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
what are you talking about?

264
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,722
I know of their language.

265
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,638
I know of these people.

266
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,061
Their spirits fly
with the evil one.

267
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:20,846
No.

268
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,191
No.

269
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:42,368
I know that you wouldn't lie.

270
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:45,917
I won't tell.

271
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,839
I can keep a secret.

272
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,891
What do you want?

273
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,059
Don't talk to me in
that tone, young lady.

274
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:03,483
Why did you push Camilla?

275
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:04,431
I saw you do it.

276
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:05,357
Why?

277
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,184
Camilla prays to the spirits,

278
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,066
and her spirits hate Dolly.

279
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,407
Jessie,

280
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:16,360
whatever it was you
said to Camilla,

281
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:17,990
did you hear it from her?

282
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:18,946
Dolly told me.

283
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,077
Stop saying that!

284
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,498
Now, where did you hear it?

285
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,411
Okay come on.

286
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,121
I want you to
apologize to Camilla.

287
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,466
Leave Dolly here.

288
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:45,849
I'm sorry I pushed your plate.

289
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,182
Camilla, I don't
want to interfere

290
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,982
with your religious
practices, but...

291
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,069
Sefora, there is evil here.

292
00:24:58,414 --> 00:24:59,414
I can feel it.

293
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:01,868
I pray to protect us
from the evil spirit.

294
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,209
Right, right, right.

295
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:04,377
That's my point.

296
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,862
In the future, I
would appreciate it

297
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,795
if you could just, uh,

298
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,249
make your observances
more private.

299
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,127
If you could just...

300
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,469
I understand.

301
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:16,963
Today I spoke to my
sister in the convent.

302
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,473
I think it's best that
you find someone else

303
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:21,811
for your house.

304
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:30,984
Where are you going?

305
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,562
We're just going out
for a quick dinner.

306
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,193
Did you have a good
time with mommy today?

307
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,535
It was okay.

308
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,243
She's been acting
very funny lately.

309
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,031
Maybe you should
have a talk with her.

310
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,656
I don't think she likes it here.

311
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,080
Do you know what?

312
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:49,422
I think you're right,

313
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,711
and we're going to have to
be very patient with mommy.

314
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:05,188
Good night, honey.

315
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,221
Good night, daddy.

316
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,976
Good night, Dolly.

317
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,287
Dolly?

318
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,127
Dolly?

319
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,390
Dolly, where are you?

320
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:01,609
Dolly, don't hide
from me, please.

321
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:19,095
Dolly?

322
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,606
Dolly?

323
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,692
Dolly, where are you?

324
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,787
Jessie, follow me.

325
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,141
Jessica.

326
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,164
Jessica!

327
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,330
What are you doing?

328
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,204
Come back in the house.

329
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,878
Jessica!

330
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:20,626
Why aren't you listening to
me qirl?

331
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:23,084
I'm talking to you.

332
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,592
Jessica, you come
back in the house.

333
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:42,822
You sit down.

334
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,149
I'll go around the front.

335
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:06,887
Jimmy!

336
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:09,265
Open the door!

337
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,388
Ay! This kid.

338
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:28,709
Jessica, is that you?

339
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:43,723
Jessie, now we can play.

340
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,220
No lights.

341
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:18,879
Camilla said there was a problem

342
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:20,464
with the fuse box.

343
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:21,809
I'll check.

344
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:07,935
Jimmy?

345
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:09,604
Huh?

346
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:10,941
You scared me.

347
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:12,526
What's with the candle?

348
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:13,854
The electricity is out.

349
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,195
Is your sister in here?

350
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,447
No.

351
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:18,362
Maybe she's with Camilla.

352
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:19,658
I'll go.

353
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,330
Camilla's not there.

354
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,633
Well, then they
must be together.

355
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,130
I bet they're in your room.

356
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,400
Oh.

357
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:38,737
Damn it.

358
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,237
Maybe they're downstairs.

359
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,987
She's so afraid
of the lightning.

360
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:29,865
Jessie?

361
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,366
She's not in there.

362
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:34,543
Oh, my god.

363
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,000
She's in the Dollhouse.

364
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,076
I'll get you all tucked in

365
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,127
and cozy and I'll read
you a bedtime story.

366
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,080
Would you like that?

367
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,665
I just spoke with her family.

368
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,466
They're making all
the arrangements.

369
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,177
Are you okay?

370
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,113
Jessica,
would you lock the door?

371
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,864
Lock the door now.

372
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,873
That's a good girl.

373
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,542
Ah, she's listening.

374
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:53,095
If she comes, don't open it.

375
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:54,433
No, no.

376
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:00,057
Jessica, don't open it.

377
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,355
Jessie, open up the door.

378
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,069
Jessica?

379
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,830
What did you do to your hair?

380
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,416
We cut it.

381
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,126
Don't I look like Dolly now?

382
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:32,961
Jessica, you were
holding the door.

383
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:34,306
Dolly locked the door.

384
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,077
She doesn't like
people coming in here.

385
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:37,511
This is our house.

386
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,808
Jessie, I want you
to leave Dolly here

387
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,386
and I want you to come with me.

388
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:42,103
No, thank you.

389
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,725
We'd rather stay here.

390
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,813
I'm sorry, mommy.

391
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,243
It's just that Dolly's

392
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:56,985
the only friend I have,

393
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,866
and I don't want to lose her.

394
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,908
Can I stay for just
a little while?

395
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,913
I'll leave the door open.

396
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,994
I love you, mommy.

397
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,997
I love you, too.

398
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:11,924
I love you so much.

399
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:15,712
Are you okay?

400
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,048
I'm okay, mommy.

401
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:20,679
I am.

402
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,226
Okay.

403
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:08,230
God!

404
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:09,568
Sorry.

405
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,662
Come on! Get
the hell out of there!

406
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,190
Hi.

407
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,647
Uh, you're the archeologist
from the university?

408
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:16,992
Hi.

409
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,554
I'm Jimmy Wade. My dad owns
the factory over there.

410
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:20,138
Son, the sign up
there says "no pase."

411
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:21,949
That means this entire
area is off limits,

412
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,405
so please, take a hike.

413
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:25,728
Okay, but you're
going to need my help

414
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:26,958
when you get down in there.

415
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,431
Further down, you'll
see the top is caved in,

416
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:31,997
the opening's too small.

417
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,777
You won't be able
to squeeze through.

418
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,257
I'll take my chances.

419
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:36,595
I'll wait.

420
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,454
How far back have
you been in there?

421
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:27,343
Uh, only about halfway,

422
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,895
but I can squeeze
through to the end.

423
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,059
I can do it.

424
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:34,187
I can be like your
eyes and ears for you.

425
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:35,529
What do you think?

426
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,380
Does your father
know you're down here?

427
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:39,606
Sure, he does.

428
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,311
My father's always
looking for ways

429
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:42,984
to further my education,

430
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,911
so let me crawl on top
and take a look for you.

431
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,076
I've done it before,

432
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:48,951
but it's getting
kinda dark in there,

433
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,373
if you know what I mean.

434
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:54,374
Look, I appreciate your
fondness for exploration,

435
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,125
but we'll both just have to wait

436
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,707
to see what's inside the crypt.

437
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,167
A crypt.

438
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:00,843
I knew it was a crypt!

439
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:01,635
Hey!

440
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:03,463
Come back here.

441
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:04,808
Hey.

442
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:05,389
Oh.

443
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:06,726
Neat hat.

444
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,625
What do you see?

445
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,461
Uh,

446
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:44,806
I don't know.

447
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:45,849
It's real small.

448
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,011
It's a coffin, I guess.

449
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,852
But it's made out
of stone maybe?

450
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,270
All right, that's enough.

451
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,357
Come out of there now!

452
00:44:58,654 --> 00:44:59,234
Wow.

453
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:00,106
What a rush.

454
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:00,903
Now what?

455
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,240
Ow!

456
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:02,863
Ow!

457
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:03,781
Don't you ever do that again.

458
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:04,573
I won't.

459
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:05,911
You hear?

460
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:09,405
You know, I've been reading
up you know, on the Mayans

461
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:10,905
because I wanted to be prepared

462
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,083
for when you got here.

463
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,832
I mean, you being
from the university

464
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:15,785
and me only being
in seventh grade.

465
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:18,246
I just didn't want you to think

466
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,004
that I couldn't handle the job,

467
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:20,422
because I can.

468
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,091
I can handle the job.

469
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,634
What job?

470
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:24,971
Your assistant.

471
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,326
Does your dad's
factory have a phone?

472
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:27,971
Oh, sure.

473
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:29,309
Come on.

474
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:29,932
He'll let you use it.

475
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,100
So, uh, who's buried in there?

476
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,396
A Maya king?

477
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:34,933
He must be a short guy.

478
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,980
This is like king tut, right?

479
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:38,318
Are you coming?

480
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,450
I'll go get my dad.

481
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:53,247
Put the boxes over here.

482
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,002
This is my father, Elliot Wade.

483
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:03,002
Karl resnick.

484
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:04,834
I hope this isn't an imposition.

485
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,794
You can use my phone anytime.

486
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,925
These creatures are beautiful.

487
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:10,267
Very haunting.

488
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:11,393
Yes, they are.

489
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:12,519
The more I'm with them,

490
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:14,803
the more they take on
a life of their own.

491
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:18,310
I'm sorry about the
accident at your excavation.

492
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:19,651
Thank you.

493
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,858
Bob larabe was a
very dedicated man.

494
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,402
If his theory is correct,

495
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,855
this excavation will
answer many questions

496
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,861
about a bizarre tribe of people

497
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:29,942
called the sanzia.

498
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:31,994
What do you mean, it's not Maya?

499
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,331
Oh, no.

500
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:34,454
Not Maya.

501
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:38,501
The sanzias occupied this
area about 900 years ago.

502
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:41,625
Sanzia means Satan on earth.

503
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:43,001
Sounds fascinating.

504
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,342
When do you start?

505
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,468
I'll start tonight.

506
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:46,884
My men will arrive tomorrow.

507
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,678
The pipe! The pipe!
There's water all over!

508
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:51,096
Okay water main.

509
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:52,048
Excuse me.

510
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:52,973
The phone is in the corner.

511
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:54,311
Help yourself.

512
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:55,478
Give me a hand.

513
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,648
Tonight, huh?

514
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,182
When the sun disappears,

515
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:02,983
I expect your face
to go with it.

516
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:04,321
Understood?

517
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:10,532
Sanzia.

518
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,030
Sanzia.

519
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,451
"Cult of the dead."

520
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:31,431
Wow.

521
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,163
It's may the third.

522
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:08,708
1900 hours.

523
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:16,351
I'm in the tunnel.

524
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,975
I have already observed

525
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,022
these inscriptions
on the photographs

526
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,225
sent to me by larabe.

527
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,481
They appear to be sanzia.

528
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:32,781
I'm going to remove
the earth by hand.

529
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,458
No, we already finished.

530
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:51,963
When will you be home?

531
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:53,544
In about an hour.

532
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:54,423
The fridge again?

533
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:55,379
No, it's not that.

534
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:56,724
It's, uh,

535
00:48:58,853 --> 00:48:59,888
it's Jessica.

536
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:02,290
What's wrong with her?

537
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:02,723
I don't know what's wrong.

538
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,976
I'm worried about her.

539
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,103
I don't know, uh,

540
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:09,811
I don't know what to do

541
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:11,716
about this fixation
she has on the doll.

542
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,423
Let me finish
here, and I'll be home soon.

543
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:16,487
All right.

544
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:17,829
Okay sure.

545
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:19,612
We'll talk about it
when you get back.

546
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,208
Okay

547
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,960
I love you.

548
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:25,128
I love you, too.

549
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:36,303
Mr. Wade, you join
me in a burrito?

550
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,346
Sounds good, Luis,
but no, thanks.

551
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,175
I'm going to be getting
out of here soon.

552
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:47,932
Well, I think I
better go to bed.

553
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:49,277
So early?

554
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,238
Good night!

555
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:26,561
That's it.

556
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:27,354
I've had it.

557
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:28,180
Luis, it's all yours.

558
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:29,526
Lock up for me.

559
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,277
Good night.

560
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,520
Good night, Mr. Wade.

561
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,266
I can now see
additional inscriptions

562
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,594
on the left side of the crypt.

563
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:07,939
Larabe was right.

564
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:10,191
They're sanzia.

565
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,934
They are warnings,

566
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,989
warnings not to cross the
threshold of the tomb.

567
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:45,435
Senorita.

568
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,852
I say you join me
for dinner, eh?

569
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:53,436
You look very
lovely tonight, huh?

570
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,233
Heh heh heh heh!

571
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:56,571
Of course

572
00:51:57,448 --> 00:51:59,188
you look lovely every night.

573
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,070
You want to lambada, no?

574
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:04,412
Whoo-hoo!

575
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:10,996
You come up to my
room later, eh?

576
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,340
No?

577
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,878
You women, you're
all alike, you know?

578
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,364
Well, let me tell you something.

579
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,503
You're ugly,

580
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:24,930
and your nose is shiny, too.

581
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,267
Heh heh heh heh!

582
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:30,890
You got a big head.

583
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:33,814
All women have big heads.

584
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:50,914
You wait here.

585
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,457
I'll be right back.

586
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,347
Hey, hey, give me a hand.

587
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:37,124
Surprise.

588
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:40,329
We got you.

589
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:42,002
We got you.

590
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:30,876
The interior of the crypt

591
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,381
is three meters

592
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:37,220
by three by 2.5 in height.

593
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:40,052
It doesn't appear that
it's been entered.

594
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:44,150
It's beautiful.

595
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:51,688
It's at least 900 years old.

596
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:54,570
The detail is amazing.

597
00:56:57,789 --> 00:57:01,156
It is the story of creation.

598
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:04,128
It is the story

599
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:09,165
of the birth of evil on earth.

600
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:18,257
Oh, god, larabe.

601
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:21,267
It is the crypt.

602
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,179
This is where the sanzia

603
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,606
have entombed the devil child.

604
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:09,433
Oh, man.

605
00:58:09,778 --> 00:58:10,778
What a screw up.

606
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:53,151
Now we'll have some fun.

607
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,278
Is anybody here?

608
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:18,872
Who are you?

609
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,217
Are you crazy?

610
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:20,715
What are you doing?

611
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,052
You must stop this.

612
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:24,307
Everybody will be killed
if you do not stop this.

613
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:26,029
What are you talking
about? Who are you?

614
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:28,097
You brought their evil back,

615
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:30,346
with your picks
and your shovels.

616
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,678
Close the tomb now and leave.

617
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:34,023
The sanzias are dead.

618
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:35,232
All of them are dead.

619
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:36,648
He opened up the gate to hell,

620
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:38,521
and the killings began.

621
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:40,318
There will be others.

622
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:43,897
The soul of the
sanzia child is alive.

623
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:46,028
It has returned.

624
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:47,734
All of the children
are in danger.

625
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:50,783
Close the tomb now

626
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:53,623
and maybe god will spare us.

627
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:55,878
Wait.

628
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:57,213
Wait!

629
01:01:58,340 --> 01:01:59,340
Wait!

630
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,084
Wait for me!

631
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:09,141
What was that about?

632
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,392
Superstition.

633
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:13,809
There's frequent opposition

634
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:15,561
to dredging up the past,

635
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:17,764
a past descendants
of the sanzias

636
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:19,940
would prefer we left in secrecy.

637
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,278
I'm looking for my son.

638
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:22,403
He snuck out of the house.

639
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,799
I thought he might
be here with you.

640
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:25,939
Jimmy, my assistant,
the explorer?

641
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:28,070
No, I haven't seen him, ha, yet.

642
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:06,067
What's going on here?

643
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:29,794
That's it.

644
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,140
I'm getting out of here.

645
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,682
Dad, there's a man in there.

646
01:03:43,028 --> 01:03:43,483
He's dead!

647
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,229
I saw him!

648
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:45,026
Jimmy, stop it.

649
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:46,363
Calm down.

650
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:46,986
Calm down.

651
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:48,324
Stay here.

652
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:50,659
Luis!

653
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:53,162
Luis?

654
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:58,208
Luis!

655
01:03:58,335 --> 01:03:59,335
Luis!

656
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:07,384
Hello?

657
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:09,129
It's an emergency.

658
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:11,966
We need an ambulance...

659
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:14,672
At camino El Rey

660
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:36,653
Looks like it was
a heart attack.

661
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,416
Under the circumstances
with Luis,

662
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:43,994
I'm not going to punish you,

663
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:47,164
but what you did was
totally irresponsible.

664
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:49,875
Just what did you think you
were gonna do out there?

665
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:51,220
I don't know.

666
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:54,050
Mr. resnick mentioned
that old tribe,

667
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:55,722
and I read all about them,

668
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:58,095
how they were like
really weird dudes.

669
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,392
They tried to make, like,

670
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,266
an evil kid or something,

671
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:04,438
you know, a devil
child, they called it.

672
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:07,271
Sanzias were into
really scary stuff.

673
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:10,194
It just got me going, I guess.

674
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:12,332
What did you say the
name of that tribe was?

675
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:13,565
Sanzia.

676
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,320
From now on, you
can forget about

677
01:05:15,662 --> 01:05:17,462
some of the more exotic
goings-on around here,

678
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:20,238
such as Mr. resnick and
the archeological digs.

679
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,038
What?

680
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:22,912
Dad, come on.

681
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:24,914
The digs are a cool place.

682
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:26,774
What does that have
to do with anything?

683
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:28,398
It has to do with your ability

684
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:30,541
to separate what's
real and what's not.

685
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,145
What are you doing?

686
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,423
I thought that you'd
be more comfortable

687
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:57,013
if Dolly slept over
there in the chair.

688
01:05:57,328 --> 01:05:58,328
Don't touch her.

689
01:05:58,580 --> 01:05:59,640
Jessica, I'm taking the doll

690
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:00,744
out of the bed

691
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:02,802
and I don't want hear
another word about it.

692
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:05,794
I'll kill you!

693
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:07,790
I'll kill you if you
try to separate us!

694
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:08,586
I'll kill you!

695
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:09,582
She's mine!

696
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:10,959
She's mine!

697
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:11,881
Whoa!

698
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:13,754
Neat trick with your voice.

699
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:24,391
Daddy, mommy's trying to
take Dolly away from me.

700
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:27,855
Don't take her, daddy!

701
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:28,727
Calm down.

702
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:30,228
I want my Dolly.

703
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:33,155
It's okay.

704
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:36,031
We keep each other company.

705
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:36,947
Come on.

706
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:38,650
Get under the covers now.

707
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:39,995
Jimmy, go to your room.

708
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:43,363
She said she'd kill me.

709
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:44,993
If you'd heard
her voice, Elliot.

710
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,203
Elliot, she's changing.

711
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:51,548
She's, she's changing.

712
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:52,674
It's,

713
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:54,176
it's the doll.

714
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:56,197
It's controlling her somehow.

715
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:58,553
It's doing something to her.

716
01:06:58,890 --> 01:06:59,890
Don't you see it?

717
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:03,133
No, I don't see it.

718
01:07:03,478 --> 01:07:05,014
I see that you've changed.

719
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:07,075
What you're saying is
completely irrational.

720
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:08,334
I want to get her out of here.

721
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:09,358
I'm afraid for her.

722
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:10,936
I want to take her back to la.

723
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:14,481
Marilyn, we've
invested everything

724
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:15,822
into this factory.

725
01:07:16,074 --> 01:07:17,074
We can't just pack up

726
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,207
because our seven-year-old
is having a tantrum.

727
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:21,912
Honey,

728
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,321
we'll work with her, okay?

729
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:25,666
She'll be all right.

730
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,871
Just let her go
through some changes.

731
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:31,123
You're not hearing
a word I'm saying.

732
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:35,040
That man, that man Karl resnick,

733
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:36,665
what do you know about the crypt

734
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:37,383
in the field?

735
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,960
Why is he so interested in it?

736
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:41,261
He's interested because
he's an archeologist.

737
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:42,599
What are you suggesting?

738
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:43,305
I don't know.

739
01:07:43,643 --> 01:07:44,223
I don't know.

740
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:46,097
I'm trying to make sense of it.

741
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,971
Camilla was frightened
of the sanzia.

742
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:51,316
She said that Jessica

743
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:53,107
spoke to her in their language.

744
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:55,214
You told me yourself
Camilla spent half the day

745
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:56,774
mumbling over burning candles.

746
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:01,324
If Jessica said anything,
she heard it from her.

747
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:02,867
No, she didn't, Elliot.

748
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:03,863
She heard it from someone,

749
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:05,205
but it wasn't her.

750
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:08,948
Okay I'm sorry.

751
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:12,751
I'm tired, I'm hungry,

752
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:14,249
it's the middle of the night,

753
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:16,164
and I don't want to
hear this right now.

754
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:04,879
Mr. resnick, I'm Marilyn Wade.

755
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,385
Oh, happy to meet
you, sefora Wade.

756
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:11,553
I see your beauty
in your son's face.

757
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:12,353
How is he?

758
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:13,690
He had a rough night.

759
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,981
It was an unfortunate
experience.

760
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:17,399
Yes, it was.

761
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:19,318
I wonder if I could talk to you

762
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:20,896
about these carvings down here.

763
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:21,570
Oh, please.

764
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:22,908
These.

765
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:26,071
These were removed
from the tomb?

766
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:27,412
Yes.

767
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:31,368
Well, actually, they're
portions of the damaged door.

768
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:34,166
See, the details are exquisite.

769
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:35,539
These are very old.

770
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:36,880
Sanzia, right?

771
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:38,090
Correct.

772
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:41,583
Our son tells us

773
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:43,338
these people have
a grisly history.

774
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:47,255
What is it that
you're looking for?

775
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,702
We're looking for the remains

776
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:50,432
of the sanzia devil child.

777
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:51,384
The legends say

778
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:53,594
the sanzia prepared a place

779
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:56,022
for the birth of Satan's child.

780
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:56,973
They suckled a child

781
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:58,979
that was neither man nor beast.

782
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,901
It had the body of an infant

783
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:02,775
and the head of a goat.

784
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:04,526
They fed it with the warm blood

785
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:06,232
of slaughtered children.

786
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:08,943
A child so evil that
its reign of terror

787
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:10,994
almost caused their extinction

788
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:12,452
before they put the creature

789
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:13,865
to its howling death.

790
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:16,166
And you knew this before
you opened the crypt?

791
01:10:16,504 --> 01:10:19,337
Sefora, whatever
made the sanzia afraid,

792
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:21,630
this child was not supernatural.

793
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:24,288
- How do you know it wasn't?
- Because I'm a man of reason.

794
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:25,345
It's not possible.

795
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:29,593
Mr. resnick, my daughter
has been drawing these symbols

796
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:31,265
since we arrived here.

797
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:32,602
Our housekeeper Camilla

798
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:35,019
told me that Jessica
spoke sanzia to her.

799
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:37,813
She tried to warn me,
and now she's dead

800
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:39,936
and so is the night watchman,

801
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:42,856
and so is your archeologist,

802
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:45,998
and my daughter is being
touched by something,

803
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:47,524
by some outside force.

804
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:49,972
Sefior resnick!
We need help with the machine!

805
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:51,031
How much time?

806
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:53,328
Sefiora, where are you going?

807
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:54,852
Camilla said she has a sister

808
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:55,876
in the convent.

809
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:58,170
I want to speak with her.

810
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:25,353
Uh, mom said you
should take a nap.

811
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,614
Um, but that's okay,

812
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:36,118
you don't have to if
you don't want to.

813
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:01,897
Do you speak english?

814
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:03,235
Yes, I do.

815
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:05,856
I'm looking for sister alva.

816
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:07,197
Sister alva is ill.

817
01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:09,947
A member of her family
has passed away.

818
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:11,284
Yes, I know.

819
01:12:11,536 --> 01:12:13,216
Please, it's very
important that I see her.

820
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:13,943
She's in seclusion.

821
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:14,868
Please.

822
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:16,912
My daughter's life is in danger.

823
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:47,571
I'm Marilyn Wade.

824
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:50,198
I know who you are.

825
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:56,489
I'm very sorry
about your sister.

826
01:13:05,423 --> 01:13:07,379
Did Camilla tell you
about my daughter?

827
01:13:10,428 --> 01:13:11,964
You of the modern world.

828
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:15,888
You put your faith
in your machines,

829
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:17,590
your science.

830
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:19,971
You ignore the powers
of heaven and hell.

831
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:23,729
My sister tried to warn you.

832
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:26,057
Yes, I know she did.

833
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:28,518
But, please, tell me now.

834
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:30,979
What is happening
to my daughter?

835
01:13:31,324 --> 01:13:32,359
How can I stop it?

836
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:34,367
It's too late.

837
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:37,159
The spirit of the
sanzia devil child

838
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:38,076
has been set free.

839
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:39,414
It's too late.

840
01:13:39,707 --> 01:13:41,698
Listen to me, I'm
not losing my daughter

841
01:13:42,043 --> 01:13:44,659
to a goddamn
900-year-old goat head!

842
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:51,256
Tell me what you know.

843
01:13:53,304 --> 01:13:55,545
How does this thing,

844
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:57,255
this spirit work?

845
01:13:58,643 --> 01:14:00,349
Could it, could it
go into something

846
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:04,307
other than a human?

847
01:14:04,649 --> 01:14:06,185
Could it go into a doll?

848
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:08,481
The devil takes
any form it desires.

849
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:10,442
It can be one,

850
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:11,986
or it can be many.

851
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:16,399
The sanzia devil
child wants children.

852
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:18,742
It will do anything

853
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,786
to spread its word
to the children.

854
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:22,203
Through the dolls?

855
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:25,617
I don't know what
course Satan will travel.

856
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:28,044
All I can do is pray
for their salvation.

857
01:14:41,394 --> 01:14:42,975
You see?

858
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:44,270
It has begun.

859
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:47,103
There will be no end
to its reign of fear.

860
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:57,181
It's fear that
keeps them ignorant.

861
01:14:57,243 --> 01:14:58,858
To believe that
malarkey is insanity.

862
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:00,909
Maybe it is, maybe it is.

863
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,887
I have a husband who
thinks it's insanity,

864
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:05,414
and I'm inclined
to agree with him,

865
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:07,116
but I have a daughter at home

866
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:09,543
who's being controlled
by a fucking doll.

867
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:12,584
Now, you tell me what
the hell that is.

868
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:49,961
Jessica?

869
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:52,672
Are you in there?

870
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,260
Shh.

871
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:41,255
What are you doing in there?

872
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:42,006
I'm hiding.

873
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:43,007
Where's Jessica?

874
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:44,349
They're in their room.

875
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:45,006
Ma, ya gotta go look.

876
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:45,885
The doll talks.

877
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:46,886
I saw it.

878
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:48,228
It moves and everything.

879
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:48,884
The door's locked.

880
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:50,345
I need a...

881
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:04,285
Jessica?

882
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:12,502
Jessie?

883
01:17:57,548 --> 01:17:58,548
Where is she?

884
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:01,006
What have you done with her?

885
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:02,924
She's in here with me.

886
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:04,718
She belongs to me.

887
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:06,636
You'll never get her back now.

888
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:08,134
We're together forever!

889
01:18:08,475 --> 01:18:09,590
Ha ha hal

890
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:11,721
she'll always be mine!

891
01:18:12,062 --> 01:18:13,643
Mommy, mommy, help me!

892
01:18:13,981 --> 01:18:14,436
Help me!

893
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:15,228
No!

894
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:16,566
I want my daughter!

895
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:28,232
Call your father at the factory.

896
01:18:28,454 --> 01:18:29,774
I'm going to get
her out of there.

897
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:04,656
Mom, it's busy.

898
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:05,445
I can't get through.

899
01:19:05,783 --> 01:19:06,783
Keep trying.

900
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:08,862
Jimmy, I want you
to stay downstairs.

901
01:19:09,954 --> 01:19:11,014
Suppose you need me?

902
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:12,494
Do as I say for once!

903
01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:42,151
Jessica?

904
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:09,053
Operator?

905
01:20:09,346 --> 01:20:11,211
Uh, emergencia.

906
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:12,557
Interruption.

907
01:20:13,976 --> 01:20:14,590
No.

908
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:15,935
Interruption.

909
01:20:17,438 --> 01:20:17,893
What?

910
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:19,230
No.

911
01:20:19,398 --> 01:20:20,729
Never, nevermind.

912
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:19,492
Oh, sweetheart.

913
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:21,869
Oh, sweetheart.

914
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:25,749
Jimmy, get in the car!

915
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:27,090
Jimmy, where are you?

916
01:21:31,345 --> 01:21:31,800
Oh, goody.

917
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:33,968
We're going for a ride.

918
01:21:37,601 --> 01:21:38,886
Get out of my way.

919
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:41,640
Jessica, let's play with mommy.

920
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:45,983
Hold her down!

921
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:47,068
Don't let her go!

922
01:21:47,111 --> 01:21:48,111
We'll fix mommy!

923
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:51,152
Get her!

924
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:51,945
Get her!

925
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:53,863
Let's kill her!

926
01:21:54,201 --> 01:21:55,201
I hate you!

927
01:21:56,078 --> 01:21:57,078
Kill her!

928
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:07,419
Play with this, bitch.

929
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:22,645
Uhh, uhh.

930
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:26,190
Mommy.

931
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:29,110
Mommy.

932
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:03,467
It's time to play.

933
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:43,286
Oh, my god.

934
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:44,618
It's true.

935
01:24:44,955 --> 01:24:45,955
What have I done?

936
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:00,970
Pull it!

937
01:25:09,646 --> 01:25:11,056
We've got you now!

938
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:22,241
This is fun!

939
01:25:42,596 --> 01:25:43,596
You!

940
01:25:53,065 --> 01:25:54,425
Ready to go in the mixer?

941
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:02,653
Help!

942
01:26:02,991 --> 01:26:03,991
Help!

943
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:06,324
Oh!

944
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:07,662
You!

945
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:09,869
Help!

946
01:26:10,207 --> 01:26:11,207
Ready?

947
01:26:11,291 --> 01:26:12,291
No!

948
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:16,921
Help!

949
01:26:18,632 --> 01:26:19,632
Help!

950
01:26:22,052 --> 01:26:23,292
No!

951
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:24,637
Help!

952
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:32,096
You want to be next?

953
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:33,437
Help!

954
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,607
Where do you kill the power?

955
01:26:38,944 --> 01:26:40,650
On the wall!

956
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:57,618
Are you all right?

957
01:26:58,714 --> 01:26:59,829
I got to get home.

958
01:27:00,173 --> 01:27:02,414
There's another
one at the house.

959
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:17,102
Thank god you're all right.

960
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:18,149
Elliot,

961
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:20,144
it was alive.

962
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:22,855
It was alive.

963
01:27:23,196 --> 01:27:23,605
I know.

964
01:27:23,947 --> 01:27:24,947
They're all alive.

965
01:27:25,282 --> 01:27:26,692
How is this happening?

966
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:28,113
I don't know.

967
01:27:29,035 --> 01:27:30,035
Wow.

968
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:31,985
Oh, my god. What
are you going to do?

969
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:33,615
We're going back inside.

970
01:27:33,957 --> 01:27:35,077
Take the kids down the hill.

971
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:36,292
Elliot, no.

972
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:37,562
Let's just get out
of here, please.

973
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:39,042
I don't know how this happened,

974
01:27:39,379 --> 01:27:41,210
but we're going to destroy them.

975
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:42,548
All of them.

976
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:44,110
Elliot, we can get
help from someone.

977
01:27:44,134 --> 01:27:45,454
Don't go in there,
please, Elliot!

978
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:49,631
We don't have
time to run a wire.

979
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:51,759
The longest fuse is a minute.

980
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,510
Place it and move
on to the next.

981
01:27:53,852 --> 01:27:55,558
We'll line the inside perimeter.

982
01:27:55,896 --> 01:27:56,305
Take the right.

983
01:27:56,646 --> 01:27:57,646
I'll go to the left,

984
01:27:57,981 --> 01:27:58,515
we'll come down the
center to the door.

985
01:27:58,857 --> 01:27:59,312
Perfect.

986
01:27:59,649 --> 01:28:00,183
Can I go?

987
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:01,525
Can I set one?

988
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:03,045
No. Jimmy, I want
you down the hill

989
01:28:03,069 --> 01:28:04,069
with your mother.

990
01:28:04,321 --> 01:28:06,041
I don't want you anywhere
near this factory.

991
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:07,114
Here.

992
01:28:17,918 --> 01:28:18,918
Get down.

993
01:28:21,421 --> 01:28:22,421
Jimmy.

994
01:28:22,672 --> 01:28:23,672
Jimmy!

995
01:28:24,007 --> 01:28:25,167
I'm going to blow up the pit.

996
01:28:35,185 --> 01:28:36,595
Hey, come here!

997
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,360
Bastards!

998
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:01,168
Mom, get back!

999
01:29:01,294 --> 01:29:02,294
The pit's going to blow!

1000
01:29:29,072 --> 01:29:30,072
Huh?

1001
01:30:08,153 --> 01:30:09,233
Honey, it's over.
