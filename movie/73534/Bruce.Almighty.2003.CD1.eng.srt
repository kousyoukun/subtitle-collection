1
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,611
- Ally, can we get a recap?
- Remember the Kowolskis?

2
00:00:50,696 --> 00:00:55,024
They want to set a record by
making Buffalo's largest cookie.

3
00:00:55,116 --> 00:00:57,073
- You have to wear this.
- A hairnet?

4
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,239
H.ealth Department. If you're around
the cookie, you have to have it on.

5
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,705
I just did the hair.

6
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,165
The hair is perfect.

7
00:01:04,249 --> 00:01:06,455
All right, give it to me.

8
00:01:08,545 --> 00:01:12,044
God... why do you hate me?

9
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:14,883
We're rolling. And speed.

10
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:17,754
For three decades,
the Kowolski Bakery

11
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:20,762
has been a mainstay
in downtown Buffalo,

12
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:24,548
known for their sinfully sweet,
cream-filled Polski pierogies

13
00:01:24,643 --> 00:01:28,592
and the occasional
sugar-induced coma that follows.

14
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:31,523
Today, in honor of their 30th anniversary,

15
00:01:31,607 --> 00:01:35,521
they've invited us to ride along
as they go for the record

16
00:01:36,236 --> 00:01:38,561
on Buffalo's biggest cookie.

17
00:01:41,241 --> 00:01:45,155
Vol. Do you need
a tissue or something?

18
00:01:45,244 --> 00:01:47,913
Can we get Vol a tissue? Or a spoon?

19
00:01:47,997 --> 00:01:49,870
Good thing we're wearing these.

20
00:01:49,957 --> 00:01:53,326
I wouldn't want any stray hairs
to fall into the booger.

21
00:01:53,418 --> 00:01:56,205
- We doing this again?
- No. We can cut to B roll.

22
00:01:56,296 --> 00:01:57,576
Moving on!

23
00:01:57,672 --> 00:02:02,049
Tell me, Mama,
why make Buffalo's biggest cookie?

24
00:02:02,552 --> 00:02:09,514
Well, man from Health Department
say he find rat pellet in our pastry.

25
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,012
But I say no, is big chocolate sprinkle.

26
00:02:14,104 --> 00:02:16,855
But he shut store down.

27
00:02:17,023 --> 00:02:19,478
So we clean up,

28
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:23,813
make big cookie
for to bring customers back.

29
00:02:25,155 --> 00:02:27,194
Well, I admire your candor.

30
00:02:27,282 --> 00:02:29,156
Let's try that again, shall we?

31
00:02:29,242 --> 00:02:33,286
Tell me, Mama,
why make Buffalo's biggest cookie?

32
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,540
So the children of the neighborhood
will be happy.

33
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:42,326
It must be wonderful seeing
the smiles on their little faces.

34
00:02:43,588 --> 00:02:46,079
I work in back. I see no smiles.

35
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:53,595
The previous record was 8 feet
7 inches, baked by Gladys Pelsnick.

36
00:02:53,681 --> 00:02:56,681
If this cookie beats that, it will prove

37
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:59,008
the Kowolskis
have much more free time.

38
00:02:59,102 --> 00:03:02,886
And the cookie is... 1 0 feet, 4 inches!

39
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:05,650
We have a new record!

40
00:03:06,275 --> 00:03:09,062
Cue the cheesy inspirational music!

41
00:03:26,835 --> 00:03:29,243
But what are we really looking at here?

42
00:03:29,338 --> 00:03:31,211
Is it just a big cookie?

43
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:34,464
Or does this cookie represent
the pride of Buffalo?

44
00:03:34,551 --> 00:03:37,919
Its hard-working citizens
the key ingredient -

45
00:03:38,012 --> 00:03:40,088
with a few nuts thrown in.

46
00:03:41,015 --> 00:03:43,221
And finally,
the love of our families,

47
00:03:43,308 --> 00:03:46,060
which provides the warm center,

48
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:50,604
making our beloved Buffalo
the sweetest place to live.

49
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,560
And that's the way
the cookie crumbles.

50
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:56,687
I'm Bruce Nolan, Eyewitness News.

51
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,772
And cut.

52
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,531
So what do you think?

53
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,076
It's really good.

54
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,829
It sucks. It's a story about a cookie.

55
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:10,246
The Pillsbury Doughboy
would be riveted.

56
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:14,745
It made me laugh. Nothing wrong
with making people laugh.

57
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:18,537
I'll never be an anchorman.
The job's there, but I can't reach it.

58
00:04:18,632 --> 00:04:23,626
Every time they make me do
this kind of stuff I have to act like a goof.

59
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,171
I have no credibility. Not good.

60
00:04:27,264 --> 00:04:29,636
- Now you just sound silly.
- Forget it.

61
00:04:29,725 --> 00:04:33,390
It's not important.
Let's watch it one more time.

62
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,512
- No.
- Once more? Please?

63
00:04:35,605 --> 00:04:39,140
No! You promised to help me
with this photo album.

64
00:04:40,276 --> 00:04:42,482
Now get your gooy butt over here.

65
00:04:47,115 --> 00:04:49,191
Looking.

66
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:50,857
OK.

67
00:04:50,952 --> 00:04:55,080
Just go through this stack
and pick your favorites.

68
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,834
Come on. This is fun, right?

69
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,996
Isn't this fun? This is nice.

70
00:05:05,006 --> 00:05:06,999
Evan's going to get that anchor job.

71
00:05:07,092 --> 00:05:08,752
- Bruce!
- He's the favorite.

72
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:12,627
You know what? Just forget it.
This is just our life.

73
00:05:12,722 --> 00:05:15,806
We can always just
have some kid do it for us.

74
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,427
Hold the phone.

75
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,092
I like this one.
Our weekend at the lake.

76
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:24,224
That's supposed to be in our private stash.

77
00:05:24,315 --> 00:05:27,684
- You look perky. Must have been cold.
- Give it to me.

78
00:05:27,777 --> 00:05:30,232
I think I'll put this on my computer.

79
00:05:30,321 --> 00:05:32,360
- Give it to me. Come on.
- No!

80
00:05:32,448 --> 00:05:34,606
Fine. Do with it what you will.

81
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,443
I don't care.

82
00:05:36,535 --> 00:05:39,025
- I will do with it what I will.
- Jesus.

83
00:05:41,164 --> 00:05:43,489
I might even send this in to Playboy.

84
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:47,497
- Their layouts can be quite tasteful.
- Give that to me right now!

85
00:05:48,504 --> 00:05:50,580
- Rough stuff.
- I'm going to hurt you.

86
00:05:56,344 --> 00:05:58,550
Sweetie? Time to get up.

87
00:06:01,098 --> 00:06:03,174
Good dream. No.

88
00:06:12,901 --> 00:06:17,562
The Buffalo Sabres lost again last
night to the Toronto Maple Leafs.

89
00:06:17,655 --> 00:06:20,110
Of course they did. They're my team.

90
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:22,525
That's the way the cookie crumbles.

91
00:06:22,618 --> 00:06:25,618
There might be something
to this cookie line.

92
00:06:25,704 --> 00:06:31,326
The greatest anchors have a signature
sign-off. Like Walter Cronkite.

93
00:06:33,294 --> 00:06:35,582
And that's the way it was.

94
00:06:35,671 --> 00:06:39,004
That's the way the cookie crumbles.

95
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:43,633
That's the way I like it

96
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,215
Oh, no.

97
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:48,927
- Grace, the dog!
- I'm in the shower!

98
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:55,639
No, Sam. Bad dog.

99
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:58,056
Inside, bad. Outside, good.

100
00:07:05,156 --> 00:07:07,232
You're done now. Great.

101
00:07:08,325 --> 00:07:11,112
B-E-A-utiful.

102
00:07:12,913 --> 00:07:15,664
Come on.
Let's go back in and have a shit.

103
00:07:21,128 --> 00:07:24,212
- What is the dillio?
- We are having a blood drive.

104
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:27,671
- Needles. Yuck.
- They need my blood.

105
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,175
I have a very rare blood type.
I'm AB positive.

106
00:07:31,262 --> 00:07:33,421
Really? I'm IB positive.

107
00:07:33,514 --> 00:07:37,594
I B positive they ain't touching me
with no needle. It's just so...

108
00:07:37,685 --> 00:07:40,520
- Helpful and life-saving?
- No. It's blood.

109
00:07:40,604 --> 00:07:44,222
Blood is supposed to stay
inside the body, where it's meant to be.

110
00:07:44,316 --> 00:07:48,313
Besides, they stockpile this stuff
in a warehouse, it's all on ice,

111
00:07:48,403 --> 00:07:50,229
and they say there's a shortage.

112
00:07:50,321 --> 00:07:52,314
Where did you hear that?

113
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:54,363
From a friend of a friend

114
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:58,068
of a girl whose sister is going out with
someone in the government.

115
00:07:58,162 --> 00:08:00,533
For your protection,
I cannot discuss it.

116
00:08:00,622 --> 00:08:03,029
Now get out,
before they see us together.

117
00:08:07,044 --> 00:08:09,915
Here. You need these more than I do.

118
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:11,464
What is "these"?

119
00:08:11,548 --> 00:08:13,790
Prayer beads.
The kids made them for me.

120
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:17,833
- They will keep you safe.
- I hope they're powerful.

121
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:21,464
I'm going to need a friggin' miracle
to get to work on time.

122
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:35,815
This isn't happening.
Not now. Not during sweeps week.

123
00:08:40,074 --> 00:08:41,948
Oh, God.

124
00:08:42,826 --> 00:08:45,364
Yup, meeting started without me.

125
00:08:45,454 --> 00:08:48,075
This is my luck.

126
00:08:54,962 --> 00:08:57,038
Come on.

127
00:09:00,717 --> 00:09:02,793
Jesus.

128
00:09:02,928 --> 00:09:05,004
Get out of there!

129
00:09:09,142 --> 00:09:12,226
"Are you blind?" No, but I'm late.

130
00:09:14,438 --> 00:09:17,355
Is your child in dire jeopardy?

131
00:09:17,441 --> 00:09:19,517
Find out tonight after the game.

132
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:21,353
Promos are approved.

133
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:24,647
Jack? Shouldn't we be focusing
on Pete's retirement?

134
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:28,238
- This is his last week.
- Any word on the anchor position?

135
00:09:28,326 --> 00:09:31,326
Evan, when I know something,
you'll know something.

136
00:09:32,162 --> 00:09:33,822
Sorry I'm late.

137
00:09:33,914 --> 00:09:36,286
Traffic was...

138
00:09:36,374 --> 00:09:38,201
Did you already play the spots?

139
00:09:38,293 --> 00:09:41,044
Nice story,
but we're going with Evan's piece.

140
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:44,497
The sex scandal
in the mayor's office for sweeps.

141
00:09:46,008 --> 00:09:48,713
Yeah. Sweeps.

142
00:09:49,344 --> 00:09:51,669
And that's the way
the cookie crumbles.

143
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:55,507
I'm just messing with you, Bruce.

144
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,851
See, you just gotta remember that
the newsroom is like a big cookie.

145
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:07,480
Do you like jazz, Evan?
Let me play something for you.

146
00:10:14,575 --> 00:10:17,362
- I can hold that note all day.
- Knock it off, guys.

147
00:10:17,912 --> 00:10:20,118
We'll keep your story in reserve.

148
00:10:20,205 --> 00:10:24,368
Can we get back to the board so we'll
have something to put on the air today?

149
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:28,326
Great choice, Jack.
The Cadillac of bolognas.

150
00:10:28,421 --> 00:10:30,295
Jack, can I talk to you?

151
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:33,050
- Sure. What do you need?
- Sweeps.

152
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:37,001
Jack, hear me out.
I'm starting to get desperate.

153
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,426
I'm pushing 40
and what have I got to show?

154
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:44,010
I've hit a kind of ceiling. There's an
anti-Bruce barrier I can't get past.

155
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:47,435
And Evan is loving it.

156
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:51,471
He gets the stories, he gets on sweeps...
I should be more like Evan.

157
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,773
Don't be like Evan. Evan's an asshole.

158
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,695
- I can be an asshole.
- No, Bruce. You can't.

159
00:11:01,617 --> 00:11:04,369
- You going to pick that up?
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

160
00:11:04,453 --> 00:11:08,237
This anchor thing opening up
has got me nuts.

161
00:11:08,332 --> 00:11:10,408
- Hi, Susan.
- Hi, Jack.

162
00:11:12,711 --> 00:11:15,996
You're a good reporter.
You make people laugh.

163
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,500
All right. I'll tell you what.

164
00:11:19,592 --> 00:11:22,877
Today is the 1 56th anniversary
of the Maid Of The Mist.

165
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:27,382
- I want you in Niagara Falls in an hour.
- The Maid Of The Mist is always live.

166
00:11:28,975 --> 00:11:33,352
- Evan always does the live feeds.
- Now you and Evan get the live feeds.

167
00:11:33,438 --> 00:11:35,679
I'm going live? During sweeps?

168
00:11:35,773 --> 00:11:38,180
Watch your step.
I've seen your out takes.

169
00:11:38,275 --> 00:11:40,232
Jack, you will not regret this.

170
00:11:41,236 --> 00:11:43,905
And I won't forget you
when I go national.

171
00:11:43,989 --> 00:11:45,648
Can you...?

172
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:48,775
Thanks, pal.

173
00:11:48,868 --> 00:11:52,700
Can I have your wish now?
I'll put it in the wish jar.

174
00:11:52,788 --> 00:11:54,199
Put your wish in.

175
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,365
- Me, too.
- Put your wish in.

176
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,832
That looks like a big wish.

177
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:01,919
No, Martin, don't eat that.

178
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:05,041
Don't put that in your mouth.
That's paste, honey.

179
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,426
- That must have tasted awful.
- Mommy!

180
00:12:12,723 --> 00:12:15,842
Did you have a good time
with Aunt Gracie today?

181
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:20,394
- See how nice this is? Baby on the hip.
- It's amazing. You've become Mom.

182
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,805
The transformation is complete.

183
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:25,264
I'll get it.

184
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:27,233
- Small Wonders Day Care.
- Grace?

185
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:30,439
It's Debbie, the sister
whose life you're not wasting.

186
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,736
- OK.
- Bye, Debbie!

187
00:12:32,824 --> 00:12:34,900
Hi. Sorry.

188
00:12:34,993 --> 00:12:37,993
Debbie forgot to take her meds today.
Where are you?

189
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,616
A little place
called the winner's circle.

190
00:12:40,706 --> 00:12:42,912
I'm at the falls, doing a live report.

191
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,992
Live? That's great!

192
00:12:45,085 --> 00:12:48,169
Yeah! It's happening, hon.
I got sweeps and I'm live.

193
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,543
They're seeing if I can think on my feet.

194
00:12:50,632 --> 00:12:53,502
Like I might have to do
in a live anchor situation.

195
00:12:53,593 --> 00:12:55,252
Oh, my gosh.

196
00:12:55,344 --> 00:12:59,176
Yeah! Jack practically came out
and told me.

197
00:12:59,264 --> 00:13:00,545
Practically?

198
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:03,558
He didn't spell it out. Legally, he can't.

199
00:13:03,643 --> 00:13:08,139
This is what happened to Susan Ortega
before they bumped her up to the desk.

200
00:13:08,231 --> 00:13:10,437
It's good.

201
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:14,688
Well, honey, I just don't want you
to get too ahead of yourself.

202
00:13:14,778 --> 00:13:16,438
- Bruce.
- I got to go!

203
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,780
- They're calling me in.
- OK, honey. Good luck. I love you.

204
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:23,654
Let's do it.

205
00:13:23,911 --> 00:13:27,778
- They want you close to the falls.
- I'm going to get soaked.

206
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:30,446
That's the point.
They want you to put this on.

207
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:33,626
Part of the condition
of us getting the exclusive.

208
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:37,792
You know what?
Nothing can bother me today. Nothing.

209
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:41,547
Now remember,
it's their 1 56th-year anniversary.

210
00:13:41,636 --> 00:13:45,680
1 49 capacity. They cater
to tourists, honeymooners...

211
00:13:45,764 --> 00:13:48,635
And people who are insanely thirsty.
I get it.

212
00:13:48,725 --> 00:13:51,346
You're going to interview
Irene Dansfield.

213
00:13:51,436 --> 00:13:55,599
Irene, a pleasure to meet you.
You look beautiful.

214
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,062
Irene's mother rode on the maiden voyage.

215
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,059
- Rub that in my face!
- 90 seconds!

216
00:14:00,152 --> 00:14:01,646
Holy hell.

217
00:14:03,989 --> 00:14:06,028
Because of the fast response,

218
00:14:06,116 --> 00:14:10,160
the chemicals were cleaned up
without incident. Susan?

219
00:14:10,245 --> 00:14:12,486
Bruce Nolan is at Niagara Falls.

220
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,913
But before we go live to Bruce,
we have an announcement.

221
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,537
As everyone knows, after 33 years,

222
00:14:18,627 --> 00:14:21,996
our beloved Pete Fineman is retiring.

223
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:26,750
Pete's shoes are virtually impossible
to fill, but the show must go on.

224
00:14:26,843 --> 00:14:32,347
And we could think of no one better
than our very own Evan Baxter.

225
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:35,887
Oh, boy!

226
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,014
- Congratulations.
- I'm thrilled and honored.

227
00:14:39,104 --> 00:14:43,682
As you said, no one can replace
Pete, but I will do my best.

228
00:14:43,775 --> 00:14:48,436
I am so proud to be a part
of our local community of Buffalo.

229
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:53,653
I think, in a lot of ways, a great
city is like a great recipe, really.

230
00:14:53,742 --> 00:14:57,276
You take hard-working citizens,
add some care-givers,

231
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,197
maybe a few nuts!

232
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,248
All sprinkled with the love
and support of our good families.

233
00:15:06,336 --> 00:15:10,416
Ultimately, that makes
one sweet place to live.

234
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,043
- That was amazing.
- I wish I'd written something.

235
00:15:14,135 --> 00:15:17,800
And now let's go live to that wacky
Bruce Nolan at Niagara Falls.

236
00:15:17,888 --> 00:15:19,632
Hey, wacky Bruce!

237
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:27,304
- Talk, Bruce. Hello.
- Talk, honey.

238
00:15:27,397 --> 00:15:29,271
- What's going on?
- A Walt Disney.

239
00:15:29,357 --> 00:15:31,812
- It's frozen solid.
- Check the feed.

240
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:34,107
We may be having technical difficulty.

241
00:15:34,195 --> 00:15:36,152
- The feed's good, Jack.
- Come on.

242
00:15:36,238 --> 00:15:40,022
- Talk, Bruce, damn it.
- Get ready to pull the plug.

243
00:15:40,117 --> 00:15:42,607
Come on, baby. Say something!

244
00:15:42,994 --> 00:15:44,785
Bruce, talk.

245
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,498
- Hi, Susan.
- Thank you, God.

246
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:50,959
Bruce Nolan here,

247
00:15:51,043 --> 00:15:54,626
aboard the Maid Of The Mist
in fabulous Niagara Falls, New York.

248
00:15:55,297 --> 00:15:59,460
First, let me just add another
congratulations to Evan Backstabber.

249
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:01,792
Pardon me, Bastard... Baxter.

250
00:16:01,886 --> 00:16:04,803
It is good to see what
someone with real talent can do

251
00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:08,174
when great opportunities
are given to them instead of me.

252
00:16:09,643 --> 00:16:12,679
Anyway, I'm here
with Katharine Hepburn's mom.

253
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:17,516
Why did you throw the Heart of the Ocean
jewel over the railing of the Titanic ?

254
00:16:18,192 --> 00:16:20,648
Did you feel bad
letting Leo DiCaprio drown

255
00:16:20,736 --> 00:16:23,144
while you were safe
floating on the door?

256
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:24,816
Could you have taken turns?

257
00:16:24,907 --> 00:16:28,406
Or were you too afraid
to freeze your big fat ass off?

258
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:31,321
I guess that's how life is.

259
00:16:31,413 --> 00:16:35,955
Some people are drenched, freezing
on a stupid boat with a stupid hat,

260
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:39,375
while others are in a news studio,
sucking up the glory.

261
00:16:39,461 --> 00:16:41,537
Oh, well. No big deal.

262
00:16:42,923 --> 00:16:46,457
The owner of the Maid Of The Mist.
Let's have a talk with him.

263
00:16:46,551 --> 00:16:49,552
Come on in here, Bill.
No, let's have a talk.

264
00:16:49,637 --> 00:16:51,630
What are you doing?

265
00:16:51,722 --> 00:16:54,925
You've been running
the Maid Of The Mist for 23 years.

266
00:16:55,017 --> 00:16:57,140
Why do you think
I didn't get anchor?

267
00:16:57,227 --> 00:16:59,765
- I don't want any problems.
- Is it my hair?

268
00:16:59,855 --> 00:17:03,105
Are my teeth not white enough?
Or, like the great falls,

269
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:08,351
is the bedrock of my life
eroding beneath me?

270
00:17:08,446 --> 00:17:10,189
Eroding!

271
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:13,815
Eroding!

272
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,996
- Cut the feed. Go to black.
- I'm on it.

273
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:23,578
I'm Bruce Nolan, for Eyewitness News.
Back to you, fuckers!

274
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,912
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, my God.

275
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:33,627
That is perfect.

276
00:17:33,718 --> 00:17:36,636
That is the motivation that I needed!

277
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:38,879
Right there! Thank you!

278
00:17:40,349 --> 00:17:43,599
Thank you, WKBW.

279
00:17:43,686 --> 00:17:47,137
Wimpy... Kitty Baby Whiners!

280
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,306
That's what that stands for!

281
00:17:50,942 --> 00:17:53,314
I'll see you on Channel 5.

282
00:17:53,403 --> 00:17:55,525
Where they do the real news!

283
00:17:56,822 --> 00:17:58,898
Do I look blind to you?

284
00:18:02,202 --> 00:18:04,242
Let's go, man. Come on.

285
00:18:04,996 --> 00:18:06,870
What are you doing?

286
00:18:06,956 --> 00:18:09,163
Come on. Leave the poor guy alone!

287
00:18:10,126 --> 00:18:12,368
You OK, man?

288
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:15,622
Yeah, you better keep walking.

289
00:18:15,965 --> 00:18:19,131
- What'd you say, ese ?
- Run, man!

290
00:18:19,217 --> 00:18:21,293
Run!

291
00:18:22,304 --> 00:18:24,426
Oh, God!

292
00:18:26,682 --> 00:18:28,675
OK, I didn't mean it!

293
00:18:29,226 --> 00:18:32,227
- I was just kidding!
- Hey, you forgot your things.

294
00:18:36,942 --> 00:18:39,017
Say something now!

295
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,447
B-E-A...

296
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:48,983
..utiful.

297
00:18:52,456 --> 00:18:55,029
That's what I get...

298
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:58,161
That's what I get
for trying to help someone.

299
00:19:00,171 --> 00:19:02,626
Don't look at me, Walter.

300
00:19:02,715 --> 00:19:04,791
Oh, no!

301
00:19:09,012 --> 00:19:11,088
That's my payment, I guess.

302
00:19:11,181 --> 00:19:13,588
That is my reward.

303
00:19:18,604 --> 00:19:22,020
Just? Just get a clue!

304
00:19:23,316 --> 00:19:24,976
Thank God you're all right.

305
00:19:25,068 --> 00:19:27,274
God, yeah. Let's thank God.

306
00:19:27,362 --> 00:19:30,113
For his blessings
are raining down upon me.

307
00:19:30,198 --> 00:19:33,234
- Wait! That's not rain!
- Bruce, please don't do that.

308
00:19:33,325 --> 00:19:35,947
Everything happens for a reason.

309
00:19:36,036 --> 00:19:39,239
That I don't need. That is a clich?
That is not helpful.

310
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:41,904
"A bird in the hand
is worth two in the bush."

311
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,036
I have no bird! No bush!
God has taken my bird and my bush.

312
00:19:45,128 --> 00:19:48,294
I see. So God is picking on you?

313
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:50,788
No! He's ignoring me completely.

314
00:19:51,842 --> 00:19:54,380
He's busy giving Evan
everything he wants.

315
00:19:55,512 --> 00:19:58,678
Great, Sam. But you missed
your target. I'm over here!

316
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:01,137
Don't get mad at the dog.
It's not his fault.

317
00:20:01,225 --> 00:20:04,475
It's God's fault.
He gave him the wrong co-ordinates.

318
00:20:04,562 --> 00:20:07,099
Enough!
Will you stop being such a martyr?

319
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:09,727
I am not being a martyr! I'm a victim!

320
00:20:09,816 --> 00:20:13,730
God is a mean kid with
a magnifying glass, and I'm the ant.

321
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,026
He could fix my life if he wanted,

322
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:19,447
but he'd rather burn off my feelers
and watch me squirm.

323
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:21,905
Sweetheart, I know you're mad.

324
00:20:21,994 --> 00:20:25,528
What Evan did was slimy and wrong.

325
00:20:25,622 --> 00:20:29,073
This day could have been so
much worse. I'm just glad you're OK.

326
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:32,661
OK? News flash! I'm not OK.

327
00:20:32,754 --> 00:20:36,253
I'm not OK with a mediocre job!
Or a mediocre apartment!

328
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,009
I'm not OK with a mediocre life!

329
00:20:47,517 --> 00:20:50,636
Is that what you think we have?
A mediocre life?

330
00:20:50,728 --> 00:20:52,720
Don't make this about you.

331
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:56,396
About me?
How could I make this about me?

332
00:20:56,483 --> 00:20:59,733
It's about you. It's always about you.

333
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,145
Perfect.

334
00:21:02,238 --> 00:21:06,699
I'll have the worst day of my life
with a side order of guilt, please!

335
00:21:12,414 --> 00:21:15,949
OK, God. You want me to talk to you?

336
00:21:16,418 --> 00:21:19,335
Then talk back.
Tell me what's going on.

337
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,338
What should I do? Give me a signal.

338
00:21:24,842 --> 00:21:28,791
I need your guidance, Lord.
Please, send me a sign.

339
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:34,967
Oh, what's this joker doing now?

340
00:21:40,731 --> 00:21:43,601
OK. All right. I'll try it your way.

341
00:21:44,401 --> 00:21:49,312
All right. Lord... I need a miracle.

342
00:21:50,698 --> 00:21:52,442
I'm desperate.

343
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:54,277
I need your help, Lord.

344
00:21:54,368 --> 00:21:56,693
Please, reach into my life...

345
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,113
What the...? Where are you?

346
00:22:02,209 --> 00:22:04,285
Got you!

347
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:48,833
Fine!

348
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:50,874
The gloves are off, pal!

349
00:22:50,961 --> 00:22:53,416
Come on! Let me see a little wrath!

350
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:57,336
Smite me, O mighty smiter!

351
00:22:58,217 --> 00:23:00,625
You're the one who should be fired!

352
00:23:00,719 --> 00:23:05,215
The only one around here
not doing his job is you!

353
00:23:06,266 --> 00:23:08,342
Answer me!

354
00:23:23,365 --> 00:23:25,441
Sorry. Don't know you.

355
00:23:26,451 --> 00:23:28,527
Wouldn't call you if I did.

356
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:43,415
Oh, God!

357
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:52,510
Hello, 555 01 23.

358
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:21,040
Oh, no! Sam, this has got to stop!

359
00:24:23,627 --> 00:24:27,292
Get it straight. That's the house.
This is the bathroom.

360
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:31,508
House, bathroom. Bathroom, house.

361
00:24:34,095 --> 00:24:35,886
What's the point?

362
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:03,161
555 01 23.

363
00:25:05,748 --> 00:25:08,665
Denied that promotion?
Is life unfair?

364
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:12,001
Is someone less talented than you
reaping the benefits?

365
00:25:12,087 --> 00:25:13,711
Is your name Bruce?

366
00:25:13,797 --> 00:25:15,955
Then do we have the job for you!

367
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:19,418
We're located at 77256 23rd Street.

368
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:22,961
So come on down -
or we'll just keep beeping you.

369
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,529
"Omni Presents."

370
00:25:42,948 --> 00:25:46,233
Oh, yeah. The glass is half-full.

371
00:25:49,871 --> 00:25:52,907
Come on! Look! What is that?

372
00:25:58,462 --> 00:25:59,956
Thank you again.

373
00:26:07,845 --> 00:26:09,921
What the...?

374
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,096
You're looking for room 7.

375
00:26:21,566 --> 00:26:24,732
- Yeah, I figured.
- Want me to even those up for you?

376
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:32,656
- How do I get to room 7?
- That'd be on the 7th floor.

377
00:26:32,743 --> 00:26:36,360
- Stairs are over there.
- I'll take the elevator.

378
00:26:36,454 --> 00:26:40,119
- Out of order.
- The stairs were my second choice.

379
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:42,912
Do you mind giving me a hand
with this floor?

380
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:46,916
What? That's good.

381
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,499
Are you serious?

382
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:53,511
I'm kind of busy. Rain check.

383
00:26:54,804 --> 00:26:56,631
I'll hold you to it.

384
00:26:57,265 --> 00:26:59,969
I'm free on the 7th at 7.00.

385
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,346
The 7th at 7.00 it is.

386
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:10,771
This looks promising.

387
00:27:16,031 --> 00:27:18,024
Hello?

388
00:27:18,117 --> 00:27:21,651
Another hug antic,
gnostic waste of my life.

389
00:27:22,871 --> 00:27:24,947
Hello?

390
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,079
I'm looking for whoever runs this joint!

391
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:30,872
Be right with you. I'm fixing a light.

392
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:33,120
Tell me if it's working.

393
00:27:33,213 --> 00:27:35,372
Yeah. Seems to be.

394
00:27:35,465 --> 00:27:39,415
- Kind of bright, though.
- Yeah. It is for most people.

395
00:27:39,511 --> 00:27:43,840
Spend their lives in the dark,
trying to hide from me.

396
00:27:45,516 --> 00:27:47,674
The elevator's broken, huh?

397
00:27:47,768 --> 00:27:50,804
Yeah, but I'll get around to it.

398
00:27:52,105 --> 00:27:55,937
- You installed a clapper?
- No, but catchy jingle, isn't it?

399
00:27:56,651 --> 00:27:58,394
Clap on, clap off

400
00:27:59,862 --> 00:28:01,605
The clapper

401
00:28:02,531 --> 00:28:05,069
Just can't get it out of my head.

402
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:07,531
Well, good luck with that.

403
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,446
- I'm going to go now.
- OK.

404
00:28:09,538 --> 00:28:11,826
But the boss will be right out.

405
00:28:19,838 --> 00:28:24,132
You must be Bruce.
I've been expecting you.

406
00:28:26,428 --> 00:28:28,254
This is hilarious.

407
00:28:28,346 --> 00:28:31,097
You're the boss,
electrician and janitor.

408
00:28:31,182 --> 00:28:33,174
Must be a killer Christmas party.

409
00:28:33,267 --> 00:28:36,718
Don't get drunk, though.
One of you might need a ride home.

410
00:28:38,105 --> 00:28:41,473
You always were funny, Bruce.
Just like your father.

411
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:45,145
He didn't mind
rolling up his sleeves either.

412
00:28:45,236 --> 00:28:50,111
People underestimate the benefit of
manual labor. There's freedom in it.

413
00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:54,410
Some of the happiest people smell to
high heaven at the end of the day.

414
00:28:55,454 --> 00:28:57,576
All right, what is this?

415
00:28:57,706 --> 00:29:00,706
How do you know my father
and how did you get my number?

416
00:29:00,792 --> 00:29:02,583
I know a lot about you, Bruce.

417
00:29:04,086 --> 00:29:06,494
Just about everything there is to know.

418
00:29:07,464 --> 00:29:12,292
Everything you've ever said or done
or thought about doing.

419
00:29:13,303 --> 00:29:16,007
Right there in that file cabinet.

420
00:29:16,723 --> 00:29:20,305
- Wow! A whole drawer, just for me.
- Yeah.

421
00:29:20,393 --> 00:29:22,883
Mind if I take a look?

422
00:29:22,978 --> 00:29:25,516
It's your life.

423
00:29:25,606 --> 00:29:27,681
This oughta be good.

424
00:29:41,995 --> 00:29:44,367
This last entry was a little disturbing.

425
00:29:56,633 --> 00:29:58,673
"The gloves are off, God."

426
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,333
"God has taken my bird and my bush."

427
00:30:01,429 --> 00:30:04,845
"God is a mean kid
with a magnifying glass."

428
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:08,218
"Smite me, O mighty smiter."

429
00:30:08,311 --> 00:30:12,390
I'm not much for blaspheming,
but that last one made me laugh.

430
00:30:12,481 --> 00:30:14,557
Are you spying on me?

431
00:30:18,028 --> 00:30:20,601
Who are you?

432
00:30:20,697 --> 00:30:22,772
I am the One.

433
00:30:22,865 --> 00:30:26,115
Creator of the heavens and the earth.
Alpha and Omega.

434
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:29,908
I see where this is going.

435
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:32,783
Bruce... I am God.

436
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:34,914
Bingo! Yahtzee!

437
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:39,129
Is that your final answer?
Our survey says, "God!"

438
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,666
It was nice to meet you, God.

439
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:46,376
Thanks for the Grand Canyon.
Good luck with the Apocalypse.

440
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,921
And by the way, you suck!

441
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,054
It would have been more impressive

442
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:55,225
if you hadn't used
the cheesy file cabinet illusion.

443
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:58,098
Anybody with a brain stem
can tell that drawer

444
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,893
is being fed through the wall
from the other side.

445
00:31:00,983 --> 00:31:04,019
All you have to do
is find the crease right around here.

446
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:07,526
There is a seam here, or a hollow spot.

447
00:31:12,326 --> 00:31:14,235
Where?

448
00:31:14,328 --> 00:31:16,404
Through the dry wall and concrete?

449
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:22,458
OK, that is a good one.

450
00:31:23,169 --> 00:31:27,629
- How many fingers am I holding up?
- Thou shalt not tempt the Lord.

451
00:31:27,715 --> 00:31:29,624
- If you can't do it...
- Three.

452
00:31:29,717 --> 00:31:31,793
Two... four... nine.

453
00:31:31,885 --> 00:31:33,712
Six... eight... one.

454
00:31:36,223 --> 00:31:37,681
OK.

455
00:31:38,475 --> 00:31:40,348
How many now?

456
00:31:40,435 --> 00:31:41,763
Seven.

457
00:31:46,815 --> 00:31:50,599
- How?
- You've been complaining about me.

458
00:31:50,694 --> 00:31:53,778
- I'm tired of it.
- Don't come near me. Seriously.

459
00:31:53,863 --> 00:31:57,030
I don't want to hurt you,
but I will out of instinct.

460
00:31:57,116 --> 00:32:00,983
You haven't won a fight since
grade 5, and that was against a girl.

461
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:05,408
But she was huge.
She'd been held back.

462
00:32:05,499 --> 00:32:07,657
And the sun was in your eyes.

463
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:09,708
Ah, the ego.

464
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:12,463
Anyway, I brought you here
to offer you a job.

465
00:32:12,547 --> 00:32:15,168
- A job? What job?
- My job.

466
00:32:15,258 --> 00:32:18,591
You think you can do it better,
so here's your chance.

467
00:32:18,677 --> 00:32:22,805
When you leave this building,
you will be endowed with all my powers.

468
00:32:23,765 --> 00:32:25,722
Sure. Whatever you say, pal.

469
00:32:28,895 --> 00:32:32,762
OK. That did not happen.
No one needs to hear about it.

470
00:32:32,857 --> 00:32:34,932
I'm deleting the program.

471
00:32:36,693 --> 00:32:38,401
No.

472
00:32:38,487 --> 00:32:40,360
I'm having a breakdown.

473
00:32:40,447 --> 00:32:44,065
Everyday psychotic episode,
caused by a tumor, a brain lesion.

474
00:32:44,992 --> 00:32:46,985
Come on. Start!

475
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:51,114
That was lucky.

476
00:32:55,752 --> 00:32:57,709
Come on. Calm down.

477
00:32:57,796 --> 00:33:00,713
You did not meet God.
You do not have his powers.

478
00:33:01,466 --> 00:33:03,837
If that was God, I'm Clint Eastwood.

479
00:33:03,926 --> 00:33:06,002
Holy hell!

480
00:33:11,725 --> 00:33:14,761
Be careful what you wish for, punk.

481
00:33:15,186 --> 00:33:16,728
Nope!

482
00:33:18,147 --> 00:33:21,895
I am a reasonable,
sane human being.

483
00:33:21,984 --> 00:33:23,811
With a .44 Magnum.

484
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:26,310
The most powerful handgun in the...

485
00:33:27,322 --> 00:33:31,271
I'm not Clint Eastwood.
I'm Bruce Nolan.

486
00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:33,443
I'm Bruce Nolan!

487
00:33:47,632 --> 00:33:49,708
That was not real.

488
00:33:51,761 --> 00:33:54,512
- Coffee?
- Coffee, yeah.

489
00:33:54,596 --> 00:33:56,589
We have a special on soup today.

490
00:33:56,682 --> 00:34:00,845
- No, thank you.
- It's tomato. I made it myself.

491
00:34:02,312 --> 00:34:03,972
OK.

492
00:34:38,094 --> 00:34:40,170
Excuse me, I need a spoo-...

493
00:34:47,394 --> 00:34:49,470
It's OK. I found one.

494
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,652
Here's your soup.

495
00:34:58,737 --> 00:35:00,362
Oh, soup, right.

496
00:35:00,447 --> 00:35:02,523
Yeah, right.

497
00:35:52,035 --> 00:35:54,111
Having fun?

498
00:35:56,664 --> 00:35:58,288
Thy, thou...

499
00:35:58,374 --> 00:36:01,125
Come. Take a closer walk with me.

500
00:36:02,795 --> 00:36:05,036
- Let me explain the rules.
- Rules?

501
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:08,914
You left in such a rush,
I didn't get a chance to explain.

502
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:13,421
The two extra fingers
freaked me out a little.

503
00:36:13,512 --> 00:36:15,968
I figured I'd get your attention.

504
00:36:16,056 --> 00:36:19,259
I did the same to Gandhi.
He didn't eat for three weeks.

505
00:36:20,394 --> 00:36:22,220
Anyway, here's the deal.

506
00:36:22,312 --> 00:36:25,396
You have all my powers.
Use them any way you choose.

507
00:36:25,482 --> 00:36:28,684
There are two rules.
You can't tell anybody you're God.

508
00:36:28,776 --> 00:36:33,319
Believe me, you don't want the attention.
And you can't mess with free will.

509
00:36:36,867 --> 00:36:40,235
- Can I ask why?
- Yes! You can!

510
00:36:40,328 --> 00:36:42,404
That's the beauty of it.

511
00:36:49,795 --> 00:36:53,792
- This is amazing.
- Speaking of amazing, excuse me.

512
00:36:56,968 --> 00:37:00,171
Holy sh-... Cow.

513
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,550
Since you're through with these,
I'll keep them.

514
00:37:04,266 --> 00:37:06,674
Might come in handy some day.

515
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:09,392
See you around, kid.

516
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:13,431
- Where are you going?
- I'm... taking a vacation.

517
00:37:13,525 --> 00:37:15,316
God doesn't take vacations.

518
00:37:15,401 --> 00:37:17,441
Does he? Do... ye?

519
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:20,312
Did you ever hear of the Dark Ages?

520
00:37:20,406 --> 00:37:24,652
I'm covered. You can clear everything up
in five minutes if you want.

521
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,403
Right?

522
00:38:12,536 --> 00:38:14,908
And he saw that it was good.

523
00:38:39,852 --> 00:38:43,434
B-E-A-utiful!

524
00:38:48,776 --> 00:38:50,852
Check it out.

525
00:38:52,572 --> 00:38:54,445
Look, it's the hero.

526
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:57,449
- Whassup, homie?
- Yo, brethren, what up with thee?

527
00:38:58,702 --> 00:39:02,367
- Blessings on your alley.
- Want another can of whup ass?

528
00:39:02,455 --> 00:39:05,741
- You didn't get enough?
- He wants some more!

529
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:09,961
Surely, I say unto you dudes,
I do not wish to fight.

530
00:39:10,045 --> 00:39:14,209
So as soon as you apologize and make
a reckoning of your transgressions,

531
00:39:14,299 --> 00:39:17,964
I shall absolve you and continue
along the path of righteousness.

532
00:39:18,511 --> 00:39:20,587
What are you talking about?

533
00:39:22,724 --> 00:39:27,136
You talk kind of funny. I don't know
if you lost it up here or what.

534
00:39:27,228 --> 00:39:30,430
You want me and the homies
to apologize? Cool.

535
00:39:30,522 --> 00:39:35,267
We'll apologize the day a monkey
comes out of my butt. How about that?

536
00:39:38,905 --> 00:39:42,024
What a coincidence!
Because that's today.

537
00:40:00,132 --> 00:40:02,539
Did that monkey
just come out your crack?

538
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:10,929
This is some voodoo shit!

539
00:40:11,434 --> 00:40:13,510
You guys leaving?

540
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:16,888
Don't forget your parting gifts!

541
00:40:44,046 --> 00:40:46,715
Hey, little anal-dwelling butt monkey.

542
00:40:46,799 --> 00:40:49,586
Time for you to go home.

543
00:41:02,813 --> 00:41:05,220
I am Bruce Almighty.

544
00:41:05,315 --> 00:41:08,186
My will be done!

545
00:41:18,452 --> 00:41:21,536
What if God was one of us

546
00:41:22,331 --> 00:41:24,952
Just a slob like one of us

547
00:41:25,959 --> 00:41:28,532
Just a stranger on a bus

548
00:41:28,628 --> 00:41:30,704
Trying to make his way

549
00:41:31,672 --> 00:41:35,041
Home

550
00:41:35,134 --> 00:41:37,173
- My God.
- Call me Bruce.

551
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,467
What happened to you? You seem so...

552
00:41:44,392 --> 00:41:45,803
happy.

553
00:41:45,893 --> 00:41:48,562
Why shouldn't I be? On a night like this.

554
00:41:48,646 --> 00:41:51,516
Those are amazing. What are these?

555
00:41:51,607 --> 00:41:55,189
A new breed. A cross-pollination
between tulips and daisies.

556
00:41:55,277 --> 00:41:57,946
I call them todayzees.

557
00:41:59,614 --> 00:42:01,690
OK.

558
00:42:07,621 --> 00:42:10,028
Honey, these flowers are beautiful.

559
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:13,661
- But last night...
- Last night, I was only human.

560
00:42:18,923 --> 00:42:20,999
Barry, help me out.

561
00:43:19,143 --> 00:43:21,219
Honey? Hi.

562
00:43:21,979 --> 00:43:25,514
- I've never seen the moon that big.
- Yeah.

563
00:43:26,233 --> 00:43:28,309
We really shouldn't waste it.

564
00:43:38,953 --> 00:43:40,945
Bedroom?

565
00:43:41,038 --> 00:43:43,114
Five minutes.

566
00:43:52,131 --> 00:43:54,207
Let there be light.

567
00:43:57,511 --> 00:43:59,587
I'll be out in a minute!

568
00:44:00,347 --> 00:44:02,090
Don't rush.

569
00:44:02,182 --> 00:44:05,218
Sometimes anticipation
can heighten the...

570
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:06,424
pleasure!

571
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:08,595
Oh, God.

572
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,358
It's a funny thing about pleasure.

573
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:18,946
It can be quite... pleasurable!

574
00:44:21,908 --> 00:44:23,984
Oh, my God.

575
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,736
Pleasuring, pleasurable.

576
00:44:29,999 --> 00:44:31,409
Oh, good God!

577
00:44:41,175 --> 00:44:43,084
In international news:

578
00:44:43,177 --> 00:44:47,388
Japanese relief workers are staging an
effort to rescue hundreds of people

579
00:44:47,473 --> 00:44:50,972
stranded by a freak tidal wave
that hit Kitamoto City.

580
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:53,811
Scientists say the tsunami
may have been caused

581
00:44:53,895 --> 00:44:58,058
by what they are describing
as unusual lunar activity.

582
00:44:58,149 --> 00:45:00,225
More on this as it develops.

583
00:45:04,071 --> 00:45:08,898
Please bless my mommy, my daddy,
and especially my little sister.

584
00:45:10,868 --> 00:45:14,367
Please help me, Lord.
Please get me through this one.

585
00:45:21,336 --> 00:45:24,456
Thank you for everything else
in my life. Amen.

586
00:45:50,279 --> 00:45:52,520
Good boy.

587
00:45:54,199 --> 00:45:56,275
Forget something?

588
00:45:59,537 --> 00:46:02,407
Good boy! There are girls in the house.

589
00:46:06,794 --> 00:46:08,869
- Morning.
- Good morning.

590
00:46:08,962 --> 00:46:12,082
- I made you grilled cheese.
- My favi.

591
00:46:13,007 --> 00:46:16,423
- Honey, last night was...
- Heavenly. I know.

592
00:46:16,511 --> 00:46:21,089
I mean, I woke up and I felt like
my boobs were bigger.

593
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:24,301
- Do they look bigger to you?
- What?

594
00:46:24,393 --> 00:46:26,515
No.

595
00:46:26,603 --> 00:46:29,176
- Bigger?
- Oh, come on!

596
00:46:29,272 --> 00:46:31,063
Look at them.

597
00:46:31,149 --> 00:46:33,390
Please. They are definitely bigger.

598
00:46:33,484 --> 00:46:36,153
I mean, look. They feel huge to me.

599
00:46:36,237 --> 00:46:38,146
I have to go.

600
00:46:38,238 --> 00:46:40,610
But this has been the breast bek...

601
00:46:42,826 --> 00:46:44,106
Thank you.

602
00:46:44,202 --> 00:46:47,784
- Where are you going?
- To get my job back.

603
00:46:49,081 --> 00:46:53,542
Yeah, yeah, I am great

604
00:46:57,089 --> 00:46:59,875
Good grief! Is that what I'm driving?

605
00:47:11,101 --> 00:47:12,761
Nice car, man.

606
00:47:12,853 --> 00:47:15,343
Yeah, it gets me from A to B.

607
00:47:28,533 --> 00:47:31,867
Darn. All this horsepower
and no room to gallop!

608
00:47:35,456 --> 00:47:38,576
Hi-yo, Silver. Away!

609
00:47:46,675 --> 00:47:48,632
I wouldn't want to be a fugitive

610
00:47:48,718 --> 00:47:52,762
with Hank, Buffalo's number one
police dog, on the job.

611
00:47:52,847 --> 00:47:57,508
Phil Sidleman at the police canine
training center, Channel 5 News.

612
00:47:57,601 --> 00:47:59,677
And cut it.

613
00:48:05,275 --> 00:48:06,852
Look what the cat coughed up!

614
00:48:06,943 --> 00:48:09,943
Channel 7, right?
You're the guy that went crazy.

615
00:48:10,029 --> 00:48:13,314
- I had a bad moment.
- What are you doing here?

616
00:48:13,407 --> 00:48:15,613
- Looking for a story.
- No story here.

617
00:48:15,701 --> 00:48:20,243
This pond is all fished out.
Pretty standard stuff, anyway.

618
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:23,663
My instinct tells me
there's something more.

619
00:48:23,749 --> 00:48:26,869
Well, go with that.
It served you well in the past, right?

620
00:48:35,135 --> 00:48:37,044
Hank found something!

621
00:48:38,805 --> 00:48:40,880
We got a body!

622
00:48:41,891 --> 00:48:43,967
Shit. Get the camera! Now!

623
00:48:44,768 --> 00:48:48,468
- It's locked! The keys are inside!
- I guess every dog has his day.

624
00:48:48,939 --> 00:48:51,311
- Kid, you want to make $1 0?
- Sure.

625
00:48:51,399 --> 00:48:53,890
- Know how to use one of these?
- Duh.

626
00:48:55,862 --> 00:48:58,352
Seems to be in tune. Let's do this.

627
00:48:58,447 --> 00:49:01,567
The body of Jimmy Hoffa
was uncovered in a field today

628
00:49:01,658 --> 00:49:04,825
outside a canine training center
in Buffalo, New York.

629
00:49:04,911 --> 00:49:08,529
- Bruce Nolan was first on the scene.
- Thank you, Jane.

630
00:49:08,623 --> 00:49:11,826
As you can see,
the body is being carefully exhumed

631
00:49:11,918 --> 00:49:16,460
for transportation to a facility
where DNA can confirm the identity.

632
00:49:16,547 --> 00:49:19,547
That, however,
merely a formality at this point,

633
00:49:19,633 --> 00:49:25,338
as the body was found with a birth
certificate and dental records.

634
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:28,217
I'd call that a red-letter day
for any canine unit.

635
00:49:28,307 --> 00:49:31,012
But was that enough for Hank?
No, siree.

636
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:34,470
Moments later, he busted
a local news camera crew

637
00:49:34,563 --> 00:49:37,896
with 220 pounds of marijuana.

638
00:49:37,983 --> 00:49:40,438
I never saw it before! I swear!

639
00:49:43,779 --> 00:49:45,819
I'm Bruce Nolan...

640
00:49:45,906 --> 00:49:48,860
and that's the way
the cookie crumbles.

641
00:49:53,455 --> 00:49:55,531
Did you like that?

642
00:49:57,959 --> 00:49:59,868
Thank you, thank you.

643
00:49:59,961 --> 00:50:01,953
- Hi, Bruce.
- Hi, Susan.

644
00:50:02,046 --> 00:50:04,583
Good work. I'm impressed.

645
00:50:08,718 --> 00:50:11,672
- Did you need me for something?
- Bruce!

646
00:50:11,763 --> 00:50:13,802
Just the man I want to see.

647
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:18,136
- Hoffa? What are the odds of that?
- What are the odds of that?

648
00:50:18,227 --> 00:50:20,385
- Bruce, why don't you sit down?
- OK.

649
00:50:20,479 --> 00:50:24,263
I'm going to be straight with you.
We want you back, Bruce.

650
00:50:24,357 --> 00:50:27,892
But I want you to understand
it was not my decision to let you go.

651
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:31,647
- When the big guy gives the order...
- No harm, no foul.

652
00:50:31,739 --> 00:50:35,404
I needed to reassess my goals
and get in touch with my true self.

653
00:50:35,492 --> 00:50:38,659
- You did that in a day?
- Imagine what I could do with seven.

654
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:42,747
It is not in my power
to give you anchor.

655
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:46,283
As far as field reporting goes,
if you're looking for a bump...

656
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:49,544
Let's cut the crap
and get down to brass tacks.

657
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,301
I had you going.

658
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,592
Don't worry about it,
my old friend.

659
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:02,342
Just give me a camera.
I'll give you the news.

660
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:16,778
My secret is that I let the jalapenos
marinate in a spicy sauce

661
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:21,109
for at least 24 hours
before I stir it into the chilli.

662
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,035
Then I let it all come to a simmer.
