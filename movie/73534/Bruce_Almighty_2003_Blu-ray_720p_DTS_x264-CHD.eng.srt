1
00:00:41,422 --> 00:00:45,634
- Ally, can we get a recap?
- Remember the Kowolskis?

2
00:00:46,118 --> 00:00:50,456
They want to set a record by
making Buffalo's largest cookie.

3
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:52,499
- You have to wear this.
- A hairnet?

4
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:56,670
H.ealth Department. If you're around
the cookie, you have to have it on.

5
00:00:56,754 --> 00:00:58,130
I just did the hair.

6
00:00:58,213 --> 00:00:59,590
The hair is perfect.

7
00:00:59,673 --> 00:01:01,884
All right, give it to me.

8
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:07,473
God... why do you hate me?

9
00:01:07,556 --> 00:01:10,309
We're rolling. And speed.

10
00:01:10,392 --> 00:01:13,187
For three decades,
the Kowolski Bakery

11
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,190
has been a mainstay
in downtown Buffalo,

12
00:01:16,273 --> 00:01:19,985
known for their sinfully sweet,
cream-filled Polski pierogies

13
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:24,031
and the occasional
sugar-induced coma that follows.

14
00:01:24,114 --> 00:01:26,950
Today, in honor of their 30th anniversary,

15
00:01:27,034 --> 00:01:30,954
they've invited us to ride along
as they go for the record

16
00:01:31,663 --> 00:01:33,999
on Buffalo's biggest cookie.

17
00:01:36,668 --> 00:01:40,589
Vol. Do you need
a tissue or something?

18
00:01:40,672 --> 00:01:43,342
Can we get Vol a tissue? Or a spoon?

19
00:01:43,425 --> 00:01:45,302
Good thing we're wearing these.

20
00:01:45,385 --> 00:01:48,764
I wouldn't want any stray hairs
to fall into the booger.

21
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:51,642
- We doing this again?
- No. We can cut to B roll.

22
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:53,018
Moving on!

23
00:01:53,102 --> 00:01:57,481
Tell me, Mama,
why make Buffalo's biggest cookie?

24
00:01:57,981 --> 00:02:04,947
Well, man from Health Department
say he find rat pellet in our pastry.

25
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,451
But I say no, is big chocolate sprinkle.

26
00:02:09,535 --> 00:02:12,287
But he shut store down.

27
00:02:12,454 --> 00:02:14,915
So we clean up,

28
00:02:14,998 --> 00:02:19,253
make big cookie
for to bring customers back.

29
00:02:20,587 --> 00:02:22,631
Well, I admire your candor.

30
00:02:22,714 --> 00:02:24,591
Let's try that again, shall we?

31
00:02:24,675 --> 00:02:28,720
Tell me, Mama,
why make Buffalo's biggest cookie?

32
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:33,976
So the children of the neighborhood
will be happy.

33
00:02:34,059 --> 00:02:37,771
It must be wonderful seeing
the smiles on their little faces.

34
00:02:39,022 --> 00:02:41,525
I work in back. I see no smiles.

35
00:02:44,737 --> 00:02:49,032
The previous record was 8 feet
7 inches, baked by Gladys Pelsnick.

36
00:02:49,116 --> 00:02:52,119
If this cookie beats that, it will prove

37
00:02:52,202 --> 00:02:54,455
the Kowolskis
have much more free time.

38
00:02:54,538 --> 00:02:58,333
And the cookie is... 1 0 feet, 4 inches!

39
00:02:58,417 --> 00:03:01,086
We have a new record!

40
00:03:01,712 --> 00:03:04,506
Cue the cheesy inspirational music!

41
00:03:22,274 --> 00:03:24,693
But what are we really looking at here?

42
00:03:24,777 --> 00:03:26,653
Is it just a big cookie?

43
00:03:26,737 --> 00:03:29,907
Or does this cookie represent
the pride of Buffalo?

44
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,368
Its hard-working citizens
the key ingredient -

45
00:03:33,452 --> 00:03:35,537
with a few nuts thrown in.

46
00:03:36,455 --> 00:03:38,665
And finally,
the love of our families,

47
00:03:38,749 --> 00:03:41,502
which provides the warm center,

48
00:03:41,585 --> 00:03:46,048
making our beloved Buffalo
the sweetest place to live.

49
00:03:46,131 --> 00:03:49,009
And that's the way
the cookie crumbles.

50
00:03:49,093 --> 00:03:52,137
I'm Bruce Nolan, Eyewitness News.

51
00:03:53,138 --> 00:03:55,224
And cut.

52
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:57,976
So what do you think?

53
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,520
It's really good.

54
00:03:59,603 --> 00:04:02,272
It sucks. It's a story about a cookie.

55
00:04:02,356 --> 00:04:05,692
The Pillsbury Doughboy
would be riveted.

56
00:04:05,776 --> 00:04:10,197
It made me laugh. Nothing wrong
with making people laugh.

57
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,992
I'll never be an anchorman.
The job's there, but I can't reach it.

58
00:04:14,076 --> 00:04:19,081
Every time they make me do
this kind of stuff I have to act like a goof.

59
00:04:19,164 --> 00:04:22,626
I have no credibility. Not good.

60
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:25,087
- Now you just sound silly.
- Forget it.

61
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,841
It's not important.
Let's watch it one more time.

62
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:30,968
- No.
- Once more? Please?

63
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:34,596
No! You promised to help me
with this photo album.

64
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:37,933
Now get your gooy butt over here.

65
00:04:42,563 --> 00:04:44,648
Looking.

66
00:04:45,274 --> 00:04:46,316
OK.

67
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,529
Just go through this stack
and pick your favorites.

68
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:57,286
Come on. This is fun, right?

69
00:04:57,369 --> 00:04:59,455
Isn't this fun? This is nice.

70
00:05:00,456 --> 00:05:02,458
Evan's going to get that anchor job.

71
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,209
- Bruce!
- He's the favorite.

72
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:08,088
You know what? Just forget it.
This is just our life.

73
00:05:08,172 --> 00:05:11,258
We can always just
have some kid do it for us.

74
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,886
Hold the phone.

75
00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:16,555
I like this one.
Our weekend at the lake.

76
00:05:16,638 --> 00:05:19,683
That's supposed to be in our private stash.

77
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:23,145
- You look perky. Must have been cold.
- Give it to me.

78
00:05:23,228 --> 00:05:25,689
I think I'll put this on my computer.

79
00:05:25,773 --> 00:05:27,816
- Give it to me. Come on.
- No!

80
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,069
Fine. Do with it what you will.

81
00:05:30,152 --> 00:05:31,904
I don't care.

82
00:05:31,987 --> 00:05:34,490
- I will do with it what I will.
- Jesus.

83
00:05:36,617 --> 00:05:38,952
I might even send this in to Playboy.

84
00:05:39,036 --> 00:05:42,956
- Their layouts can be quite tasteful.
- Give that to me right now!

85
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:46,043
- Rough stuff.
- I'm going to hurt you.

86
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:54,009
Sweetie? Time to get up.

87
00:05:56,553 --> 00:05:58,639
Good dream. No.

88
00:06:08,357 --> 00:06:13,028
The Buffalo Sabres lost again last
night to the Toronto Maple Leafs.

89
00:06:13,112 --> 00:06:15,572
Of course they did. They're my team.

90
00:06:15,906 --> 00:06:17,991
That's the way the cookie crumbles.

91
00:06:18,075 --> 00:06:21,078
There might be something
to this cookie line.

92
00:06:21,161 --> 00:06:26,792
The greatest anchors have a signature
sign-off. Like Walter Cronkite.

93
00:06:28,752 --> 00:06:31,046
And that's the way it was.

94
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,466
That's the way the cookie crumbles.

95
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,096
That's the way I like it

96
00:06:40,264 --> 00:06:41,682
Oh, no.

97
00:06:41,765 --> 00:06:44,393
- Grace, the dog!
- I'm in the shower!

98
00:06:49,356 --> 00:06:51,108
No, Sam. Bad dog.

99
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:53,527
Inside, bad. Outside, good.

100
00:07:00,617 --> 00:07:02,703
You're done now. Great.

101
00:07:03,787 --> 00:07:06,582
B-E-A-utiful.

102
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:11,128
Come on.
Let's go back in and have a shit.

103
00:07:16,592 --> 00:07:19,678
- What is the dillio?
- We are having a blood drive.

104
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:23,140
- Needles. Yuck.
- They need my blood.

105
00:07:23,223 --> 00:07:26,643
I have a very rare blood type.
I'm AB positive.

106
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:28,896
Really? I'm IB positive.

107
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:33,067
I B positive they ain't touching me
with no needle. It's just so...

108
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,986
- Helpful and life-saving?
- No. It's blood.

109
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,698
Blood is supposed to stay
inside the body, where it's meant to be.

110
00:07:39,782 --> 00:07:43,786
Besides, they stockpile this stuff
in a warehouse, it's all on ice,

111
00:07:43,869 --> 00:07:45,704
and they say there's a shortage.

112
00:07:45,788 --> 00:07:47,790
Where did you hear that?

113
00:07:47,873 --> 00:07:49,833
From a friend of a friend

114
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:53,545
of a girl whose sister is going out with
someone in the government.

115
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:56,006
For your protection,
I cannot discuss it.

116
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,509
Now get out,
before they see us together.

117
00:08:02,513 --> 00:08:05,390
Here. You need these more than I do.

118
00:08:05,474 --> 00:08:06,934
What is "these"?

119
00:08:07,017 --> 00:08:09,269
Prayer beads.
The kids made them for me.

120
00:08:09,353 --> 00:08:13,315
- They will keep you safe.
- I hope they're powerful.

121
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:16,944
I'm going to need a friggin' miracle
to get to work on time.

122
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:31,291
This isn't happening.
Not now. Not during sweeps week.

123
00:08:35,546 --> 00:08:37,423
Oh, God.

124
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:40,843
Yup, meeting started without me.

125
00:08:40,926 --> 00:08:43,554
This is my luck.

126
00:08:50,436 --> 00:08:52,521
Come on.

127
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:58,277
Jesus.

128
00:08:58,402 --> 00:09:00,487
Get out of there!

129
00:09:04,616 --> 00:09:07,703
"Are you blind?" No, but I'm late.

130
00:09:09,913 --> 00:09:12,833
Is your child in dire jeopardy?

131
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,002
Find out tonight after the game.

132
00:09:15,085 --> 00:09:16,837
Promos are approved.

133
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,132
Jack? Shouldn't we be focusing
on Pete's retirement?

134
00:09:20,215 --> 00:09:23,719
- This is his last week.
- Any word on the anchor position?

135
00:09:23,802 --> 00:09:26,805
Evan, when I know something,
you'll know something.

136
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:29,308
Sorry I'm late.

137
00:09:29,391 --> 00:09:31,769
Traffic was...

138
00:09:31,852 --> 00:09:33,687
Did you already play the spots?

139
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:36,523
Nice story,
but we're going with Evan's piece.

140
00:09:36,607 --> 00:09:39,985
The sex scandal
in the mayor's office for sweeps.

141
00:09:41,487 --> 00:09:44,198
Yeah. Sweeps.

142
00:09:44,823 --> 00:09:47,159
And that's the way
the cookie crumbles.

143
00:09:48,911 --> 00:09:50,996
I'm just messing with you, Bruce.

144
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:57,336
See, you just gotta remember that
the newsroom is like a big cookie.

145
00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:02,966
Do you like jazz, Evan?
Let me play something for you.

146
00:10:10,057 --> 00:10:12,851
- I can hold that note all day.
- Knock it off, guys.

147
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:15,604
We'll keep your story in reserve.

148
00:10:15,687 --> 00:10:19,858
Can we get back to the board so we'll
have something to put on the air today?

149
00:10:19,942 --> 00:10:23,821
Great choice, Jack.
The Cadillac of bolognas.

150
00:10:23,904 --> 00:10:25,781
Jack, can I talk to you?

151
00:10:25,864 --> 00:10:28,534
- Sure. What do you need?
- Sweeps.

152
00:10:28,617 --> 00:10:32,496
Jack, hear me out.
I'm starting to get desperate.

153
00:10:32,621 --> 00:10:34,915
I'm pushing 40
and what have I got to show?

154
00:10:34,998 --> 00:10:39,503
I've hit a kind of ceiling. There's an
anti-Bruce barrier I can't get past.

155
00:10:39,586 --> 00:10:42,923
And Evan is loving it.

156
00:10:43,006 --> 00:10:46,969
He gets the stories, he gets on sweeps...
I should be more like Evan.

157
00:10:47,052 --> 00:10:49,263
Don't be like Evan. Evan's an asshole.

158
00:10:49,346 --> 00:10:52,182
- I can be an asshole.
- No, Bruce. You can't.

159
00:10:57,104 --> 00:10:59,857
- You going to pick that up?
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

160
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,736
This anchor thing opening up
has got me nuts.

161
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:05,904
- Hi, Susan.
- Hi, Jack.

162
00:11:08,198 --> 00:11:11,493
You're a good reporter.
You make people laugh.

163
00:11:13,328 --> 00:11:14,997
All right. I'll tell you what.

164
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,375
Today is the 1 56th anniversary
of the Maid Of The Mist.

165
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:22,880
- I want you in Niagara Falls in an hour.
- The Maid Of The Mist is always live.

166
00:11:24,465 --> 00:11:28,844
- Evan always does the live feeds.
- Now you and Evan get the live feeds.

167
00:11:28,927 --> 00:11:31,180
I'm going live? During sweeps?

168
00:11:31,263 --> 00:11:33,682
Watch your step.
I've seen your out takes.

169
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:35,726
Jack, you will not regret this.

170
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:39,396
And I won't forget you
when I go national.

171
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,148
Can you...?

172
00:11:42,191 --> 00:11:44,276
Thanks, pal.

173
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:48,197
Can I have your wish now?
I'll put it in the wish jar.

174
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,698
Put your wish in.

175
00:11:49,782 --> 00:11:51,867
- Me, too.
- Put your wish in.

176
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:54,328
That looks like a big wish.

177
00:11:54,411 --> 00:11:57,414
No, Martin, don't eat that.

178
00:11:57,498 --> 00:12:00,542
Don't put that in your mouth.
That's paste, honey.

179
00:12:02,753 --> 00:12:05,923
- That must have tasted awful.
- Mommy!

180
00:12:08,217 --> 00:12:11,345
Did you have a good time
with Aunt Gracie today?

181
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:15,891
- See how nice this is? Baby on the hip.
- It's amazing. You've become Mom.

182
00:12:15,974 --> 00:12:18,310
The transformation is complete.

183
00:12:19,561 --> 00:12:20,771
I'll get it.

184
00:12:20,854 --> 00:12:22,731
- Small Wonders Day Care.
- Grace?

185
00:12:22,815 --> 00:12:25,943
It's Debbie, the sister
whose life you're not wasting.

186
00:12:26,026 --> 00:12:28,237
- OK.
- Bye, Debbie!

187
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,406
Hi. Sorry.

188
00:12:30,489 --> 00:12:33,492
Debbie forgot to take her meds today.
Where are you?

189
00:12:33,575 --> 00:12:36,120
A little place
called the winner's circle.

190
00:12:36,203 --> 00:12:38,414
I'm at the falls, doing a live report.

191
00:12:38,497 --> 00:12:40,499
Live? That's great!

192
00:12:40,582 --> 00:12:43,669
Yeah! It's happening, hon.
I got sweeps and I'm live.

193
00:12:43,752 --> 00:12:46,046
They're seeing if I can think on my feet.

194
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:49,007
Like I might have to do
in a live anchor situation.

195
00:12:49,091 --> 00:12:50,759
Oh, my gosh.

196
00:12:50,843 --> 00:12:54,680
Yeah! Jack practically came out
and told me.

197
00:12:54,763 --> 00:12:56,056
Practically?

198
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,059
He didn't spell it out. Legally, he can't.

199
00:12:59,143 --> 00:13:03,647
This is what happened to Susan Ortega
before they bumped her up to the desk.

200
00:13:03,731 --> 00:13:05,941
It's good.

201
00:13:06,024 --> 00:13:10,195
Well, honey, I just don't want you
to get too ahead of yourself.

202
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,947
- Bruce.
- I got to go!

203
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,284
- They're calling me in.
- OK, honey. Good luck. I love you.

204
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:19,163
Let's do it.

205
00:13:19,413 --> 00:13:23,292
- They want you close to the falls.
- I'm going to get soaked.

206
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,961
That's the point.
They want you to put this on.

207
00:13:26,044 --> 00:13:29,131
Part of the condition
of us getting the exclusive.

208
00:13:29,214 --> 00:13:33,302
You know what?
Nothing can bother me today. Nothing.

209
00:13:33,385 --> 00:13:37,055
Now remember,
it's their 1 56th-year anniversary.

210
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:41,185
1 49 capacity. They cater
to tourists, honeymooners...

211
00:13:41,268 --> 00:13:44,146
And people who are insanely thirsty.
I get it.

212
00:13:44,229 --> 00:13:46,857
You're going to interview
Irene Dansfield.

213
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:51,111
Irene, a pleasure to meet you.
You look beautiful.

214
00:13:51,195 --> 00:13:53,572
Irene's mother rode on the maiden voyage.

215
00:13:53,655 --> 00:13:55,574
- Rub that in my face!
- 90 seconds!

216
00:13:55,657 --> 00:13:57,159
Holy hell.

217
00:13:59,495 --> 00:14:01,538
Because of the fast response,

218
00:14:01,622 --> 00:14:05,667
the chemicals were cleaned up
without incident. Susan?

219
00:14:05,751 --> 00:14:08,003
Bruce Nolan is at Niagara Falls.

220
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:11,423
But before we go live to Bruce,
we have an announcement.

221
00:14:11,507 --> 00:14:14,051
As everyone knows, after 33 years,

222
00:14:14,134 --> 00:14:17,513
our beloved Pete Fineman is retiring.

223
00:14:17,596 --> 00:14:22,267
Pete's shoes are virtually impossible
to fill, but the show must go on.

224
00:14:22,351 --> 00:14:27,856
And we could think of no one better
than our very own Evan Baxter.

225
00:14:30,317 --> 00:14:31,402
Oh, boy!

226
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:34,530
- Congratulations.
- I'm thrilled and honored.

227
00:14:34,613 --> 00:14:39,201
As you said, no one can replace
Pete, but I will do my best.

228
00:14:39,284 --> 00:14:43,956
I am so proud to be a part
of our local community of Buffalo.

229
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:49,169
I think, in a lot of ways, a great
city is like a great recipe, really.

230
00:14:49,253 --> 00:14:52,798
You take hard-working citizens,
add some care-givers,

231
00:14:52,881 --> 00:14:54,716
maybe a few nuts!

232
00:14:58,011 --> 00:15:01,765
All sprinkled with the love
and support of our good families.

233
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:05,936
Ultimately, that makes
one sweet place to live.

234
00:15:06,353 --> 00:15:09,565
- That was amazing.
- I wish I'd written something.

235
00:15:09,648 --> 00:15:13,318
And now let's go live to that wacky
Bruce Nolan at Niagara Falls.

236
00:15:13,402 --> 00:15:15,154
Hey, wacky Bruce!

237
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:22,828
- Talk, Bruce. Hello.
- Talk, honey.

238
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:24,788
- What's going on?
- A Walt Disney.

239
00:15:24,872 --> 00:15:27,332
- It's frozen solid.
- Check the feed.

240
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,626
We may be having technical difficulty.

241
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,670
- The feed's good, Jack.
- Come on.

242
00:15:31,754 --> 00:15:35,549
- Talk, Bruce, damn it.
- Get ready to pull the plug.

243
00:15:35,632 --> 00:15:38,135
Come on, baby. Say something!

244
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,304
Bruce, talk.

245
00:15:43,307 --> 00:15:45,017
- Hi, Susan.
- Thank you, God.

246
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,477
Bruce Nolan here,

247
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,147
aboard the Maid Of The Mist
in fabulous Niagara Falls, New York.

248
00:15:50,814 --> 00:15:54,985
First, let me just add another
congratulations to Evan Backstabber.

249
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:57,321
Pardon me, Bastard... Baxter.

250
00:15:57,404 --> 00:16:00,324
It is good to see what
someone with real talent can do

251
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:03,702
when great opportunities
are given to them instead of me.

252
00:16:05,162 --> 00:16:08,207
Anyway, I'm here
with Katharine Hepburn's mom.

253
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:13,045
Why did you throw the Heart of the Ocean
jewel over the railing of the Titanic ?

254
00:16:13,712 --> 00:16:16,173
Did you feel bad
letting Leo DiCaprio drown

255
00:16:16,256 --> 00:16:18,675
while you were safe
floating on the door?

256
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:20,344
Could you have taken turns?

257
00:16:20,427 --> 00:16:23,931
Or were you too afraid
to freeze your big fat ass off?

258
00:16:25,099 --> 00:16:26,850
I guess that's how life is.

259
00:16:26,934 --> 00:16:31,480
Some people are drenched, freezing
on a stupid boat with a stupid hat,

260
00:16:31,563 --> 00:16:34,900
while others are in a news studio,
sucking up the glory.

261
00:16:34,983 --> 00:16:37,069
Oh, well. No big deal.

262
00:16:38,445 --> 00:16:41,990
The owner of the Maid Of The Mist.
Let's have a talk with him.

263
00:16:42,074 --> 00:16:45,077
Come on in here, Bill.
No, let's have a talk.

264
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,162
What are you doing?

265
00:16:47,246 --> 00:16:50,457
You've been running
the Maid Of The Mist for 23 years.

266
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,668
Why do you think
I didn't get anchor?

267
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:55,295
- I don't want any problems.
- Is it my hair?

268
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:58,632
Are my teeth not white enough?
Or, like the great falls,

269
00:16:58,715 --> 00:17:03,887
is the bedrock of my life
eroding beneath me?

270
00:17:03,971 --> 00:17:05,722
Eroding!

271
00:17:05,806 --> 00:17:09,351
Eroding!

272
00:17:10,853 --> 00:17:13,522
- Cut the feed. Go to black.
- I'm on it.

273
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:19,111
I'm Bruce Nolan, for Eyewitness News.
Back to you, fuckers!

274
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:22,448
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, my God.

275
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:29,163
That is perfect.

276
00:17:29,246 --> 00:17:32,166
That is the motivation that I needed!

277
00:17:32,249 --> 00:17:34,418
Right there! Thank you!

278
00:17:35,878 --> 00:17:39,131
Thank you, WKBW.

279
00:17:39,214 --> 00:17:42,676
Wimpy... Kitty Baby Whiners!

280
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,845
That's what that stands for!

281
00:17:46,472 --> 00:17:48,849
I'll see you on Channel 5.

282
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:51,060
Where they do the real news!

283
00:17:52,352 --> 00:17:54,438
Do I look blind to you?

284
00:17:57,733 --> 00:17:59,777
Let's go, man. Come on.

285
00:18:00,527 --> 00:18:02,404
What are you doing?

286
00:18:02,488 --> 00:18:04,698
Come on. Leave the poor guy alone!

287
00:18:05,657 --> 00:18:07,910
You OK, man?

288
00:18:09,161 --> 00:18:11,163
Yeah, you better keep walking.

289
00:18:11,497 --> 00:18:14,666
- What'd you say, ese ?
- Run, man!

290
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,835
Run!

291
00:18:17,836 --> 00:18:19,963
Oh, God!

292
00:18:22,216 --> 00:18:24,218
OK, I didn't mean it!

293
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,763
- I was just kidding!
- Hey, you forgot your things.

294
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:34,561
Say something now!

295
00:18:38,065 --> 00:18:40,984
B-E-A...

296
00:18:42,111 --> 00:18:44,530
..utiful.

297
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:50,577
That's what I get...

298
00:18:50,661 --> 00:18:53,705
That's what I get
for trying to help someone.

299
00:18:55,707 --> 00:18:58,168
Don't look at me, Walter.

300
00:18:58,252 --> 00:19:00,337
Oh, no!

301
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,635
That's my payment, I guess.

302
00:19:06,718 --> 00:19:09,138
That is my reward.

303
00:19:14,143 --> 00:19:17,563
Just? Just get a clue!

304
00:19:18,856 --> 00:19:20,524
Thank God you're all right.

305
00:19:20,607 --> 00:19:22,818
God, yeah. Let's thank God.

306
00:19:22,901 --> 00:19:25,654
For his blessings
are raining down upon me.

307
00:19:25,738 --> 00:19:28,782
- Wait! That's not rain!
- Bruce, please don't do that.

308
00:19:28,866 --> 00:19:31,493
Everything happens for a reason.

309
00:19:31,577 --> 00:19:34,788
That I don't need. That is a clich?
That is not helpful.

310
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:37,458
"A bird in the hand
is worth two in the bush."

311
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:40,586
I have no bird! No bush!
God has taken my bird and my bush.

312
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:43,839
I see. So God is picking on you?

313
00:19:43,922 --> 00:19:46,341
No! He's ignoring me completely.

314
00:19:47,384 --> 00:19:49,928
He's busy giving Evan
everything he wants.

315
00:19:51,054 --> 00:19:54,224
Great, Sam. But you missed
your target. I'm over here!

316
00:19:54,308 --> 00:19:56,685
Don't get mad at the dog.
It's not his fault.

317
00:19:56,769 --> 00:20:00,022
It's God's fault.
He gave him the wrong co-ordinates.

318
00:20:00,105 --> 00:20:02,649
Enough!
Will you stop being such a martyr?

319
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:05,277
I am not being a martyr! I'm a victim!

320
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,281
God is a mean kid with
a magnifying glass, and I'm the ant.

321
00:20:09,364 --> 00:20:11,575
He could fix my life if he wanted,

322
00:20:11,658 --> 00:20:14,995
but he'd rather burn off my feelers
and watch me squirm.

323
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:17,456
Sweetheart, I know you're mad.

324
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:21,085
What Evan did was slimy and wrong.

325
00:20:21,168 --> 00:20:24,630
This day could have been so
much worse. I'm just glad you're OK.

326
00:20:24,838 --> 00:20:28,217
OK? News flash! I'm not OK.

327
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,804
I'm not OK with a mediocre job!
Or a mediocre apartment!

328
00:20:31,887 --> 00:20:34,556
I'm not OK with a mediocre life!

329
00:20:43,065 --> 00:20:46,193
Is that what you think we have?
A mediocre life?

330
00:20:46,276 --> 00:20:48,278
Don't make this about you.

331
00:20:48,362 --> 00:20:51,949
About me?
How could I make this about me?

332
00:20:52,032 --> 00:20:55,285
It's about you. It's always about you.

333
00:20:55,369 --> 00:20:57,704
Perfect.

334
00:20:57,788 --> 00:21:02,251
I'll have the worst day of my life
with a side order of guilt, please!

335
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:11,510
OK, God. You want me to talk to you?

336
00:21:11,969 --> 00:21:14,888
Then talk back.
Tell me what's going on.

337
00:21:14,972 --> 00:21:17,891
What should I do? Give me a signal.

338
00:21:20,394 --> 00:21:24,356
I need your guidance, Lord.
Please, send me a sign.

339
00:21:28,444 --> 00:21:30,529
Oh, what's this joker doing now?

340
00:21:36,285 --> 00:21:39,163
OK. All right. I'll try it your way.

341
00:21:39,955 --> 00:21:44,877
All right. Lord... I need a miracle.

342
00:21:46,253 --> 00:21:48,005
I'm desperate.

343
00:21:48,088 --> 00:21:49,840
I need your help, Lord.

344
00:21:49,923 --> 00:21:52,259
Please, reach into my life...

345
00:21:55,095 --> 00:21:57,681
What the...? Where are you?

346
00:21:57,765 --> 00:21:59,850
Got you!

347
00:22:43,018 --> 00:22:44,395
Fine!

348
00:22:44,478 --> 00:22:46,438
The gloves are off, pal!

349
00:22:46,522 --> 00:22:48,982
Come on! Let me see a little wrath!

350
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:52,903
Smite me, O mighty smiter!

351
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:56,198
You're the one who should be fired!

352
00:22:56,281 --> 00:23:00,786
The only one around here
not doing his job is you!

353
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:03,914
Answer me!

354
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:21,014
Sorry. Don't know you.

355
00:23:22,015 --> 00:23:24,101
Wouldn't call you if I did.

356
00:23:36,905 --> 00:23:38,991
Oh, God!

357
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:48,083
Hello, 555 01 23.

358
00:24:12,483 --> 00:24:16,612
Oh, no! Sam, this has got to stop!

359
00:24:19,198 --> 00:24:22,868
Get it straight. That's the house.
This is the bathroom.

360
00:24:22,951 --> 00:24:27,081
House, bathroom. Bathroom, house.

361
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,460
What's the point?

362
00:24:55,984 --> 00:24:58,737
555 01 23.

363
00:25:01,323 --> 00:25:04,243
Denied that promotion?
Is life unfair?

364
00:25:04,326 --> 00:25:07,579
Is someone less talented than you
reaping the benefits?

365
00:25:07,663 --> 00:25:09,289
Is your name Bruce?

366
00:25:09,373 --> 00:25:11,542
Then do we have the job for you!

367
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:15,003
We're located at 77256 23rd Street.

368
00:25:15,087 --> 00:25:18,549
So come on down -
or we'll just keep beeping you.

369
00:25:35,649 --> 00:25:37,109
"Omni Presents."

370
00:25:38,527 --> 00:25:41,822
Oh, yeah. The glass is half-full.

371
00:25:45,451 --> 00:25:48,495
Come on! Look! What is that?

372
00:25:54,042 --> 00:25:55,544
Thank you again.

373
00:26:03,427 --> 00:26:05,512
What the...?

374
00:26:12,603 --> 00:26:14,688
You're looking for room 7.

375
00:26:17,149 --> 00:26:20,319
- Yeah, I figured.
- Want me to even those up for you?

376
00:26:25,074 --> 00:26:28,243
- How do I get to room 7?
- That'd be on the 7th floor.

377
00:26:28,327 --> 00:26:31,955
- Stairs are over there.
- I'll take the elevator.

378
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:35,709
- Out of order.
- The stairs were my second choice.

379
00:26:35,793 --> 00:26:38,504
Do you mind giving me a hand
with this floor?

380
00:26:38,587 --> 00:26:42,508
What? That's good.

381
00:26:42,591 --> 00:26:44,093
Are you serious?

382
00:26:46,428 --> 00:26:49,098
I'm kind of busy. Rain check.

383
00:26:50,391 --> 00:26:52,226
I'll hold you to it.

384
00:26:52,851 --> 00:26:55,562
I'm free on the 7th at 7.00.

385
00:26:58,857 --> 00:27:00,943
The 7th at 7.00 it is.

386
00:27:03,987 --> 00:27:06,365
This looks promising.

387
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,622
Hello?

388
00:27:13,705 --> 00:27:17,251
Another hug antic,
gnostic waste of my life.

389
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,546
Hello?

390
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,674
I'm looking for whoever runs this joint!

391
00:27:23,757 --> 00:27:26,468
Be right with you. I'm fixing a light.

392
00:27:26,552 --> 00:27:28,720
Tell me if it's working.

393
00:27:28,804 --> 00:27:30,973
Yeah. Seems to be.

394
00:27:31,056 --> 00:27:35,018
- Kind of bright, though.
- Yeah. It is for most people.

395
00:27:35,102 --> 00:27:39,440
Spend their lives in the dark,
trying to hide from me.

396
00:27:41,108 --> 00:27:43,277
The elevator's broken, huh?

397
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,405
Yeah, but I'll get around to it.

398
00:27:47,698 --> 00:27:51,535
- You installed a clapper?
- No, but catchy jingle, isn't it?

399
00:27:52,244 --> 00:27:53,996
Clap on, clap off

400
00:27:55,456 --> 00:27:57,207
The clapper

401
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:00,669
Just can't get it out of my head.

402
00:28:00,753 --> 00:28:03,130
Well, good luck with that.

403
00:28:03,213 --> 00:28:05,048
- I'm going to go now.
- OK.

404
00:28:05,132 --> 00:28:07,426
But the boss will be right out.

405
00:28:15,434 --> 00:28:19,730
You must be Bruce.
I've been expecting you.

406
00:28:22,024 --> 00:28:23,859
This is hilarious.

407
00:28:23,942 --> 00:28:26,695
You're the boss,
electrician and janitor.

408
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:28,781
Must be a killer Christmas party.

409
00:28:28,864 --> 00:28:32,326
Don't get drunk, though.
One of you might need a ride home.

410
00:28:33,702 --> 00:28:37,081
You always were funny, Bruce.
Just like your father.

411
00:28:37,956 --> 00:28:40,751
He didn't mind
rolling up his sleeves either.

412
00:28:40,834 --> 00:28:45,714
People underestimate the benefit of
manual labor. There's freedom in it.

413
00:28:45,798 --> 00:28:50,010
Some of the happiest people smell to
high heaven at the end of the day.

414
00:28:51,053 --> 00:28:53,180
All right, what is this?

415
00:28:53,305 --> 00:28:56,308
How do you know my father
and how did you get my number?

416
00:28:56,392 --> 00:28:58,185
I know a lot about you, Bruce.

417
00:28:59,686 --> 00:29:02,106
Just about everything there is to know.

418
00:29:03,065 --> 00:29:07,903
Everything you've ever said or done
or thought about doing.

419
00:29:08,904 --> 00:29:11,615
Right there in that file cabinet.

420
00:29:12,324 --> 00:29:15,911
- Wow! A whole drawer, just for me.
- Yeah.

421
00:29:15,994 --> 00:29:18,497
Mind if I take a look?

422
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,125
It's your life.

423
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:23,293
This oughta be good.

424
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:39,977
This last entry was a little disturbing.

425
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:54,283
"The gloves are off, God."

426
00:29:54,366 --> 00:29:56,952
"God has taken my bird and my bush."

427
00:29:57,035 --> 00:30:00,456
"God is a mean kid
with a magnifying glass."

428
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:03,834
"Smite me, O mighty smiter."

429
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:08,005
I'm not much for blaspheming,
but that last one made me laugh.

430
00:30:08,088 --> 00:30:10,174
Are you spying on me?

431
00:30:13,635 --> 00:30:16,221
Who are you?

432
00:30:16,305 --> 00:30:18,390
I am the One.

433
00:30:18,474 --> 00:30:21,727
Creator of the heavens and the earth.
Alpha and Omega.

434
00:30:23,145 --> 00:30:25,522
I see where this is going.

435
00:30:25,606 --> 00:30:28,400
Bruce... I am God.

436
00:30:28,484 --> 00:30:30,527
Bingo! Yahtzee!

437
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:34,740
Is that your final answer?
Our survey says, "God!"

438
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,285
It was nice to meet you, God.

439
00:30:38,368 --> 00:30:41,997
Thanks for the Grand Canyon.
Good luck with the Apocalypse.

440
00:30:42,081 --> 00:30:45,542
And by the way, you suck!

441
00:30:45,626 --> 00:30:47,669
It would have been more impressive

442
00:30:47,753 --> 00:30:50,839
if you hadn't used
the cheesy file cabinet illusion.

443
00:30:50,923 --> 00:30:53,717
Anybody with a brain stem
can tell that drawer

444
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:56,512
is being fed through the wall
from the other side.

445
00:30:56,595 --> 00:30:59,640
All you have to do
is find the crease right around here.

446
00:30:59,723 --> 00:31:03,143
There is a seam here, or a hollow spot.

447
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,858
Where?

448
00:31:09,942 --> 00:31:12,027
Through the dry wall and concrete?

449
00:31:15,072 --> 00:31:18,075
OK, that is a good one.

450
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:23,247
- How many fingers am I holding up?
- Thou shalt not tempt the Lord.

451
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,249
- If you can't do it...
- Three.

452
00:31:25,332 --> 00:31:27,418
Two... four... nine.

453
00:31:27,501 --> 00:31:29,336
Six... eight... one.

454
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:33,298
OK.

455
00:31:34,091 --> 00:31:35,968
How many now?

456
00:31:36,051 --> 00:31:37,386
Seven.

457
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:46,228
- How?
- You've been complaining about me.

458
00:31:46,311 --> 00:31:49,398
- I'm tired of it.
- Don't come near me. Seriously.

459
00:31:49,481 --> 00:31:52,651
I don't want to hurt you,
but I will out of instinct.

460
00:31:52,735 --> 00:31:56,613
You haven't won a fight since
grade 5, and that was against a girl.

461
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,034
But she was huge.
She'd been held back.

462
00:32:01,118 --> 00:32:03,287
And the sun was in your eyes.

463
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,330
Ah, the ego.

464
00:32:05,414 --> 00:32:08,083
Anyway, I brought you here
to offer you a job.

465
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:10,794
- A job? What job?
- My job.

466
00:32:10,878 --> 00:32:14,214
You think you can do it better,
so here's your chance.

467
00:32:14,298 --> 00:32:18,427
When you leave this building,
you will be endowed with all my powers.

468
00:32:19,386 --> 00:32:21,346
Sure. Whatever you say, pal.

469
00:32:24,516 --> 00:32:28,395
OK. That did not happen.
No one needs to hear about it.

470
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:30,564
I'm deleting the program.

471
00:32:32,316 --> 00:32:34,026
No.

472
00:32:34,109 --> 00:32:35,986
I'm having a breakdown.

473
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:39,698
Everyday psychotic episode,
caused by a tumor, a brain lesion.

474
00:32:40,616 --> 00:32:42,618
Come on. Start!

475
00:32:44,661 --> 00:32:46,747
That was lucky.

476
00:32:51,376 --> 00:32:53,337
Come on. Calm down.

477
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:56,340
You did not meet God.
You do not have his powers.

478
00:32:57,091 --> 00:32:59,468
If that was God, I'm Clint Eastwood.

479
00:32:59,551 --> 00:33:01,637
Holy hell!

480
00:33:07,351 --> 00:33:10,396
Be careful what you wish for, punk.

481
00:33:10,813 --> 00:33:12,356
Nope!

482
00:33:13,774 --> 00:33:17,528
I am a reasonable,
sane human being.

483
00:33:17,611 --> 00:33:19,446
With a .44 Magnum.

484
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,949
The most powerful handgun in the...

485
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:26,912
I'm not Clint Eastwood.
I'm Bruce Nolan.

486
00:33:26,995 --> 00:33:29,081
I'm Bruce Nolan!

487
00:33:43,262 --> 00:33:45,347
That was not real.

488
00:33:47,391 --> 00:33:50,144
- Coffee?
- Coffee, yeah.

489
00:33:50,227 --> 00:33:52,229
We have a special on soup today.

490
00:33:52,312 --> 00:33:56,483
- No, thank you.
- It's tomato. I made it myself.

491
00:33:57,943 --> 00:33:59,611
OK.

492
00:34:33,729 --> 00:34:35,814
Excuse me, I need a spoo-...

493
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,115
It's OK. I found one.

494
00:34:52,498 --> 00:34:54,291
Here's your soup.

495
00:34:54,374 --> 00:34:56,001
Oh, soup, right.

496
00:34:56,085 --> 00:34:58,170
Yeah, right.

497
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:49,763
Having fun?

498
00:35:52,307 --> 00:35:53,934
Thy, thou...

499
00:35:54,017 --> 00:35:56,770
Come. Take a closer walk with me.

500
00:35:58,439 --> 00:36:00,691
- Let me explain the rules.
- Rules?

501
00:36:00,774 --> 00:36:04,570
You left in such a rush,
I didn't get a chance to explain.

502
00:36:05,946 --> 00:36:09,074
The two extra fingers
freaked me out a little.

503
00:36:09,158 --> 00:36:11,618
I figured I'd get your attention.

504
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:14,913
I did the same to Gandhi.
He didn't eat for three weeks.

505
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:17,875
Anyway, here's the deal.

506
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:21,044
You have all my powers.
Use them any way you choose.

507
00:36:21,128 --> 00:36:24,339
There are two rules.
You can't tell anybody you're God.

508
00:36:24,423 --> 00:36:28,969
Believe me, you don't want the attention.
And you can't mess with free will.

509
00:36:32,514 --> 00:36:35,893
- Can I ask why?
- Yes! You can!

510
00:36:35,976 --> 00:36:38,062
That's the beauty of it.

511
00:36:45,444 --> 00:36:49,448
- This is amazing.
- Speaking of amazing, excuse me.

512
00:36:52,618 --> 00:36:55,829
Holy sh-... Cow.

513
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:59,208
Since you're through with these,
I'll keep them.

514
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:02,336
Might come in handy some day.

515
00:37:03,003 --> 00:37:05,047
See you around, kid.

516
00:37:05,547 --> 00:37:09,093
- Where are you going?
- I'm... taking a vacation.

517
00:37:09,176 --> 00:37:10,969
God doesn't take vacations.

518
00:37:11,053 --> 00:37:13,097
Does he? Do... ye?

519
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:15,974
Did you ever hear of the Dark Ages?

520
00:37:16,058 --> 00:37:20,312
I'm covered. You can clear everything up
in five minutes if you want.

521
00:37:20,396 --> 00:37:22,064
Right?

522
00:38:08,193 --> 00:38:10,571
And he saw that it was good.

523
00:38:35,512 --> 00:38:39,099
B-E-A-utiful!

524
00:38:44,438 --> 00:38:46,523
Check it out.

525
00:38:48,233 --> 00:38:50,110
Look, it's the hero.

526
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:53,113
- Whassup, homie?
- Yo, brethren, what up with thee?

527
00:38:54,364 --> 00:38:58,035
- Blessings on your alley.
- Want another can of whup ass?

528
00:38:58,118 --> 00:39:01,413
- You didn't get enough?
- He wants some more!

529
00:39:01,497 --> 00:39:05,626
Surely, I say unto you dudes,
I do not wish to fight.

530
00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:09,880
So as soon as you apologize and make
a reckoning of your transgressions,

531
00:39:09,963 --> 00:39:13,634
I shall absolve you and continue
along the path of righteousness.

532
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,261
What are you talking about?

533
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:22,810
You talk kind of funny. I don't know
if you lost it up here or what.

534
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:26,105
You want me and the homies
to apologize? Cool.

535
00:39:26,188 --> 00:39:30,943
We'll apologize the day a monkey
comes out of my butt. How about that?

536
00:39:34,571 --> 00:39:37,699
What a coincidence!
Because that's today.

537
00:39:55,801 --> 00:39:58,220
Did that monkey
just come out your crack?

538
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,603
This is some voodoo shit!

539
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,189
You guys leaving?

540
00:40:10,482 --> 00:40:12,568
Don't forget your parting gifts!

541
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,389
Hey, little anal-dwelling butt monkey.

542
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:45,267
Time for you to go home.

543
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:00,908
I am Bruce Almighty.

544
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:03,869
My will be done!

545
00:41:14,129 --> 00:41:17,216
What if God was one of us

546
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:20,636
Just a slob like one of us

547
00:41:21,637 --> 00:41:24,223
Just a stranger on a bus

548
00:41:24,306 --> 00:41:26,392
Trying to make his way

549
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:30,729
Home

550
00:41:30,813 --> 00:41:32,856
- My God.
- Call me Bruce.

551
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,150
What happened to you? You seem so...

552
00:41:40,072 --> 00:41:41,490
happy.

553
00:41:41,573 --> 00:41:44,243
Why shouldn't I be? On a night like this.

554
00:41:44,326 --> 00:41:47,204
Those are amazing. What are these?

555
00:41:47,287 --> 00:41:50,874
A new breed. A cross-pollination
between tulips and daisies.

556
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:53,627
I call them todayzees.

557
00:41:55,295 --> 00:41:57,381
OK.

558
00:42:03,303 --> 00:42:05,723
Honey, these flowers are beautiful.

559
00:42:06,473 --> 00:42:09,351
- But last night...
- Last night, I was only human.

560
00:42:14,606 --> 00:42:16,692
Barry, help me out.

561
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:16,919
Honey? Hi.

562
00:43:17,669 --> 00:43:21,215
- I've never seen the moon that big.
- Yeah.

563
00:43:21,924 --> 00:43:24,009
We really shouldn't waste it.

564
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:36,647
Bedroom?

565
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:38,816
Five minutes.

566
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,910
Let there be light.

567
00:43:53,205 --> 00:43:55,290
I'll be out in a minute!

568
00:43:56,041 --> 00:43:57,793
Don't rush.

569
00:43:57,876 --> 00:44:00,921
Sometimes anticipation
can heighten the...

570
00:44:01,004 --> 00:44:02,131
pleasure!

571
00:44:02,214 --> 00:44:04,299
Oh, God.

572
00:44:06,301 --> 00:44:09,054
It's a funny thing about pleasure.

573
00:44:10,597 --> 00:44:14,643
It can be quite... pleasurable!

574
00:44:17,604 --> 00:44:19,690
Oh, my God.

575
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:22,443
Pleasuring, pleasurable.

576
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:27,114
Oh, good God!

577
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:38,792
In international news:

578
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:43,088
Japanese relief workers are staging an
effort to rescue hundreds of people

579
00:44:43,172 --> 00:44:46,675
stranded by a freak tidal wave
that hit Kitamoto City.

580
00:44:46,759 --> 00:44:49,511
Scientists say the tsunami
may have been caused

581
00:44:49,595 --> 00:44:53,766
by what they are describing
as unusual lunar activity.

582
00:44:53,849 --> 00:44:55,934
More on this as it develops.

583
00:44:59,772 --> 00:45:04,610
Please bless my mommy, my daddy,
and especially my little sister.

584
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:10,074
Please help me, Lord.
Please get me through this one.

585
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:20,167
Thank you for everything else
in my life. Amen.

586
00:45:45,984 --> 00:45:48,237
Good boy.

587
00:45:49,905 --> 00:45:51,990
Forget something?

588
00:45:55,244 --> 00:45:58,122
Good boy! There are girls in the house.

589
00:46:02,501 --> 00:46:04,586
- Morning.
- Good morning.

590
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:07,798
- I made you grilled cheese.
- My favi.

591
00:46:08,716 --> 00:46:12,136
- Honey, last night was...
- Heavenly. I know.

592
00:46:12,219 --> 00:46:16,807
I mean, I woke up and I felt like
my boobs were bigger.

593
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:20,018
- Do they look bigger to you?
- What?

594
00:46:20,102 --> 00:46:22,229
No.

595
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:24,898
- Bigger?
- Oh, come on!

596
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:26,775
Look at them.

597
00:46:26,859 --> 00:46:29,111
Please. They are definitely bigger.

598
00:46:29,194 --> 00:46:31,864
I mean, look. They feel huge to me.

599
00:46:31,947 --> 00:46:33,866
I have to go.

600
00:46:33,949 --> 00:46:36,326
But this has been the breast bek...

601
00:46:38,537 --> 00:46:39,830
Thank you.

602
00:46:39,913 --> 00:46:43,500
- Where are you going?
- To get my job back.

603
00:46:44,793 --> 00:46:49,256
Yeah, yeah, I am great

604
00:46:52,801 --> 00:46:55,596
Good grief! Is that what I'm driving?

605
00:47:06,815 --> 00:47:08,484
Nice car, man.

606
00:47:08,567 --> 00:47:11,070
Yeah, it gets me from A to B.

607
00:47:24,249 --> 00:47:27,586
Darn. All this horsepower
and no room to gallop!

608
00:47:31,173 --> 00:47:34,301
Hi-yo, Silver. Away!

609
00:47:42,393 --> 00:47:44,353
I wouldn't want to be a fugitive

610
00:47:44,436 --> 00:47:48,482
with Hank, Buffalo's number one
police dog, on the job.

611
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:53,237
Phil Sidleman at the police canine
training center, Channel 5 News.

612
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,406
And cut it.

613
00:48:00,994 --> 00:48:02,579
Look what the cat coughed up!

614
00:48:02,663 --> 00:48:05,666
Channel 7, right?
You're the guy that went crazy.

615
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:09,044
- I had a bad moment.
- What are you doing here?

616
00:48:09,128 --> 00:48:11,338
- Looking for a story.
- No story here.

617
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:15,968
This pond is all fished out.
Pretty standard stuff, anyway.

618
00:48:16,051 --> 00:48:19,388
My instinct tells me
there's something more.

619
00:48:19,471 --> 00:48:22,599
Well, go with that.
It served you well in the past, right?

620
00:48:30,858 --> 00:48:32,776
Hank found something!

621
00:48:34,528 --> 00:48:36,613
We got a body!

622
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:39,700
Shit. Get the camera! Now!

623
00:48:40,492 --> 00:48:44,204
- It's locked! The keys are inside!
- I guess every dog has his day.

624
00:48:44,837 --> 00:48:47,214
- Kid, you want to make $1 0?
- Sure.

625
00:48:47,298 --> 00:48:49,800
- Know how to use one of these?
- Duh.

626
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,263
Seems to be in tune. Let's do this.

627
00:48:54,346 --> 00:48:57,474
The body of Jimmy Hoffa
was uncovered in a field today

628
00:48:57,558 --> 00:49:00,728
outside a canine training center
in Buffalo, New York.

629
00:49:00,811 --> 00:49:04,440
- Bruce Nolan was first on the scene.
- Thank you, Jane.

630
00:49:04,523 --> 00:49:07,735
As you can see,
the body is being carefully exhumed

631
00:49:07,818 --> 00:49:12,364
for transportation to a facility
where DNA can confirm the identity.

632
00:49:12,448 --> 00:49:15,451
That, however,
merely a formality at this point,

633
00:49:15,534 --> 00:49:21,248
as the body was found with a birth
certificate and dental records.

634
00:49:21,332 --> 00:49:24,126
I'd call that a red-letter day
for any canine unit.

635
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:26,921
But was that enough for Hank?
No, siree.

636
00:49:27,004 --> 00:49:30,382
Moments later, he busted
a local news camera crew

637
00:49:30,466 --> 00:49:33,802
with 220 pounds of marijuana.

638
00:49:33,886 --> 00:49:36,347
I never saw it before! I swear!

639
00:49:39,683 --> 00:49:41,727
I'm Bruce Nolan...

640
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:44,772
and that's the way
the cookie crumbles.

641
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,445
Did you like that?

642
00:49:53,864 --> 00:49:55,783
Thank you, thank you.

643
00:49:55,866 --> 00:49:57,868
- Hi, Bruce.
- Hi, Susan.

644
00:49:57,952 --> 00:50:00,496
Good work. I'm impressed.

645
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:07,586
- Did you need me for something?
- Bruce!

646
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:09,713
Just the man I want to see.

647
00:50:09,797 --> 00:50:14,051
- Hoffa? What are the odds of that?
- What are the odds of that?

648
00:50:14,134 --> 00:50:16,303
- Bruce, why don't you sit down?
- OK.

649
00:50:16,387 --> 00:50:20,182
I'm going to be straight with you.
We want you back, Bruce.

650
00:50:20,266 --> 00:50:23,811
But I want you to understand
it was not my decision to let you go.

651
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,565
- When the big guy gives the order...
- No harm, no foul.

652
00:50:27,648 --> 00:50:31,318
I needed to reassess my goals
and get in touch with my true self.

653
00:50:31,402 --> 00:50:34,572
- You did that in a day?
- Imagine what I could do with seven.

654
00:50:35,739 --> 00:50:38,659
It is not in my power
to give you anchor.

655
00:50:38,742 --> 00:50:42,204
As far as field reporting goes,
if you're looking for a bump...

656
00:50:42,288 --> 00:50:45,457
Let's cut the crap
and get down to brass tacks.

657
00:50:50,421 --> 00:50:52,214
I had you going.

658
00:50:52,298 --> 00:50:54,508
Don't worry about it,
my old friend.

659
00:50:55,467 --> 00:50:58,262
Just give me a camera.
I'll give you the news.

660
00:51:07,271 --> 00:51:12,693
My secret is that I let the jalapenos
marinate in a spicy sauce

661
00:51:12,776 --> 00:51:17,031
for at least 24 hours
before I stir it into the chilli.

662
00:51:17,114 --> 00:51:19,950
Then I let it all come to a simmer.

663
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:30,252
Hold that thought. It seems as if
an asteroid or meteorite

664
00:51:30,336 --> 00:51:34,173
has just hit ground right outside
the Mark Twain Chilli Cook-Off!

665
00:51:34,924 --> 00:51:37,551
This should certainly
spice things up a bit!

666
00:51:38,177 --> 00:51:39,970
His stories are all over town.

667
00:51:40,054 --> 00:51:41,388
From unearthing Hoffa

668
00:51:41,472 --> 00:51:43,557
..to a meteor crashing,

669
00:51:43,641 --> 00:51:46,977
..Bruce Nolan is rapidly
becoming known as...

670
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:05,329
And that's the way
the cookie crumbles!

671
00:52:09,959 --> 00:52:12,419
This was Bruce's idea?

672
00:52:12,503 --> 00:52:17,007
He wanted me to have a day of beauty
and luxurious serenity.

673
00:52:18,676 --> 00:52:22,054
I got to tell you,
he is impressing me lately.

674
00:52:22,137 --> 00:52:24,306
Know where he's taking me to dinner?

675
00:52:25,683 --> 00:52:27,476
Where?

676
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,938
The Blue Palm?

677
00:52:32,856 --> 00:52:35,901
- My gosh, I got chills.
- I know.

678
00:52:35,985 --> 00:52:39,863
He told me to prepare for the most
memorable night of our lives.

679
00:52:39,947 --> 00:52:42,700
Oh, my gosh. He's going to propose.

680
00:52:42,783 --> 00:52:44,827
Oh, stop it. No. He's...

681
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:47,705
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

682
00:52:47,788 --> 00:52:50,916
Do the math.
He sends you all day to a beauty spa,

683
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,045
he's taking you to a restaurant
where you had your first date. Hello!

684
00:52:55,129 --> 00:52:57,882
I never thought I'd say this,
but Bruce is right.

685
00:52:57,965 --> 00:53:00,259
This is your night.
Relax and enjoy it.

686
00:53:00,342 --> 00:53:02,469
Oh, God.

687
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,144
Welcome to Eyewitness News at Six,
with Susan Ortega,

688
00:53:10,227 --> 00:53:11,645
Evan Baxter,

689
00:53:11,729 --> 00:53:14,523
Fred Donohue, sports,
Dallas Coleman, weather.

690
00:53:14,607 --> 00:53:16,984
And now,
Buffalo's number one news team.

691
00:53:17,067 --> 00:53:19,111
Welcome to Eyewitness News at Six.

692
00:53:19,194 --> 00:53:21,280
- I'm Susan Ortega.
- I'm Evan Baxter.

693
00:53:21,363 --> 00:53:23,407
Here's what's making news.

694
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:26,869
A potential scandal
with the Buffalo PD surfaced today,

695
00:53:26,952 --> 00:53:29,163
when the mayor demanded that...

696
00:53:30,205 --> 00:53:32,625
When the mayor
demanded the chief of...

697
00:53:35,502 --> 00:53:37,588
Issued a response to...

698
00:53:38,339 --> 00:53:40,633
I seem to have something stuck in my...

699
00:53:40,716 --> 00:53:42,676
Get him some water.

700
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,387
Looks like my new co-anchor
may need water.

701
00:53:50,434 --> 00:53:52,353
There we go. Sorry.

702
00:53:52,436 --> 00:53:57,399
In other news, the prime minister of
Sweden visited Washington today,

703
00:53:57,483 --> 00:54:00,653
and my tiny little nipples
went to France.

704
00:54:01,528 --> 00:54:03,739
What did he say? Check the prompter.

705
00:54:07,284 --> 00:54:10,120
- The prompter's fine.
- Evan, read the copy.

706
00:54:10,204 --> 00:54:11,956
The copy's good. Just read it.

707
00:54:12,706 --> 00:54:16,460
The White House committee
greeted the prime rib roast minister,

708
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:19,838
and I do the cha-cha like a sissy girl.

709
00:54:21,715 --> 00:54:24,468
I lika do...

710
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:26,595
da cha-cha.

711
00:54:30,808 --> 00:54:34,603
I'm sorry. We seem to be
having technical difficulties.

712
00:54:34,979 --> 00:54:36,855
In other news...

713
00:54:39,817 --> 00:54:41,902
My apologies.

714
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:37,041
If I ruled the world

715
00:55:38,459 --> 00:55:42,671
Every day would be
the first day of spring

716
00:55:44,381 --> 00:55:48,886
Every heart would have
a new song to sing

717
00:55:50,179 --> 00:55:56,018
And we'd sing of the joy
every morning would bring

718
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:00,064
If I ruled the world

719
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:05,903
Every man would be
as free as a bird

720
00:56:05,986 --> 00:56:08,072
- May I?
- Certainly.

721
00:56:13,494 --> 00:56:16,455
It's perfect. She'll love it.

722
00:56:16,538 --> 00:56:20,501
We would treasure
each day that occurs

723
00:56:21,168 --> 00:56:27,091
You know, I was going to wait
until after the meal,

724
00:56:27,841 --> 00:56:31,554
but it'll burst out of me
like an alien if I don't do it now.

725
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:35,099
Oh, my God. OK.

726
00:56:35,182 --> 00:56:36,976
This is it, isn't it?

727
00:56:37,059 --> 00:56:39,937
I don't know if I'm ready for this.

728
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:44,942
I mean, I'm ready. I just didn't
know if I would... I'm sorry, go on.

729
00:56:45,025 --> 00:56:48,487
- I didn't know it was so important to you.
- Me neither.

730
00:56:52,533 --> 00:56:54,618
- Grace?
- Yes?

731
00:57:02,501 --> 00:57:04,587
I got anchor.

732
00:57:05,337 --> 00:57:06,755
No.

733
00:57:08,382 --> 00:57:12,595
Yes. Apparently it wasn't
working out with Evan,

734
00:57:12,678 --> 00:57:17,141
so he's going to finish out the week
and I go live on Monday.

735
00:57:19,101 --> 00:57:23,022
- That's great, honey.
- I know, I know.

736
00:57:23,105 --> 00:57:24,773
Well...

737
00:57:27,109 --> 00:57:29,987
- So that's what this is all about.
- Well, yeah.

738
00:57:31,488 --> 00:57:32,990
We got anchor.

739
00:57:33,073 --> 00:57:36,744
Jack's throwing me a party at
the Vanderbilt estate to celebrate.

740
00:57:36,827 --> 00:57:38,787
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

741
00:57:39,371 --> 00:57:42,666
Now I lay me down to sleep...

742
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,710
I feel stupid.

743
00:57:44,793 --> 00:57:47,630
- It is loud in here, isn't it?
- No, it's not loud.

744
00:57:47,713 --> 00:57:51,050
Jeez! Can you keep it down
to a dull roar?

745
00:57:51,133 --> 00:57:53,761
- Thank you!
- Is that supposed to be funny?

746
00:57:53,844 --> 00:57:56,639
Cos that is not funny.

747
00:57:56,722 --> 00:58:00,226
- What did you say?
- What is wrong with you? Stop yelling.

748
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:05,648
If you'll excuse me,
I'll take a little trip to the...

749
00:58:05,731 --> 00:58:07,733
Our father, which art in heaven...

750
00:58:07,816 --> 00:58:10,611
The wine is going right through me.

751
00:58:10,694 --> 00:58:13,948
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

752
00:58:14,031 --> 00:58:16,242
- Keep going, Tony!
- Oh, God.

753
00:58:18,744 --> 00:58:20,663
What is going on here?

754
00:58:20,746 --> 00:58:22,706
What is this?

755
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,875
Give me a break!

756
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,966
Really something, isn't it?

757
00:58:34,635 --> 00:58:36,512
Is this heaven?

758
00:58:36,595 --> 00:58:39,181
No, this is Mount Everest.

759
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:42,351
Flip on the Discovery Channel
from time to time.

760
00:58:42,768 --> 00:58:46,355
But I guess you can't now,
being dead and all.

761
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:50,568
- I'm dead?
- I'm just messing with you.

762
00:58:51,026 --> 00:58:53,654
That's not funny, man!

763
00:58:55,739 --> 00:58:59,535
What about the voices in my head?
Is that part of the hilarity?

764
00:58:59,618 --> 00:59:03,956
No, those are prayers. You keep ignoring
them, they're going to build up.

765
00:59:04,081 --> 00:59:06,876
But it's just noise.
I can't understand them.

766
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:10,337
You're not listening, son.

767
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:12,756
Let's see.

768
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:16,927
You had my powers for a little over a week.
How many people have you helped?

769
00:59:21,181 --> 00:59:23,225
I took care of a few things.

770
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:26,562
I righted a few wrongs
in my own life first. OK?

771
00:59:26,645 --> 00:59:28,814
I was going to help the others.

772
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:32,026
- I think I could help the world.
- The world?

773
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:37,364
That wasn't the world. That was just
Buffalo, between 57th and Commonwealth.

774
00:59:40,659 --> 00:59:44,038
I didn't want to start you off with
more than you could handle.

775
00:59:44,121 --> 00:59:47,541
You took the job, Bruce,
so I suggest you get to it.

776
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:52,129
Seeing him smile
would make me so happy.

777
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:54,298
Prayers, prayers, OK.

778
00:59:55,674 --> 00:59:57,801
This creepy whisper thing has to end.

779
00:59:57,885 --> 01:00:00,054
Organization. That's what I need.

780
01:00:00,137 --> 01:00:04,225
I need a system.
Something concrete. Concentrate.

781
01:00:05,392 --> 01:00:09,813
Files. Let all prayers
be organized into files.

782
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:19,448
That takes care of the voices.
Not exactly a space-saver, though.

783
01:00:19,531 --> 01:00:21,951
Grace might notice.

784
01:00:22,034 --> 01:00:24,453
I know. Prayer Post-its!

785
01:00:39,468 --> 01:00:43,847
OK, I need something with a lock.
Security. Combination. A password.

786
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:46,725
A password.

787
01:00:53,315 --> 01:00:56,485
Welcome to the revelation
superhighway.

788
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:59,613
We bless, no mess. Downloading now.

789
01:01:03,367 --> 01:01:05,578
It's good.

790
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,790
This is going to take a while.

791
01:01:15,754 --> 01:01:20,426
1 ,527,503 prayer requests?

792
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,805
I better manifest some coffee.

793
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:48,913
Now that's fresh, mountain-grown
coffee from the hills of Colombia.

794
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:13,395
Good.

795
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:21,111
OK, I had to have made
some kind of a dent by now.

796
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:25,741
Oh, come on!

797
01:02:27,159 --> 01:02:30,955
What a bunch of whiners.
This is going to suck up my whole life.

798
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:34,708
You know what?

799
01:02:36,835 --> 01:02:38,921
Yes. To all.

800
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:44,093
Yeah. There you go.
Now everybody's happy.

801
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:56,564
I'll drink to that. My tech stocks
tripled in five days.

802
01:02:56,647 --> 01:02:58,857
Know something, Joe?
You seem taller.

803
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:01,610
- I am.
- My daughter pitched a no-hitter.

804
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:04,822
I lost 47 pounds
on the Krispy Kreme diet.

805
01:03:04,905 --> 01:03:06,490
There he is!

806
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:08,284
The man of the hour!

807
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:12,121
Bless you! Bless all of you!

808
01:03:12,204 --> 01:03:16,208
Be fruitful and...
do long division or something!

809
01:03:17,209 --> 01:03:19,712
Try that. It's an excellent year.

810
01:03:19,795 --> 01:03:22,381
Bruce!
Who do you like in the game tonight?

811
01:03:22,464 --> 01:03:25,801
I like the Sabres. Coach prays a lot.

812
01:03:47,239 --> 01:03:50,159
This is Bruce, Grace and Sam.
Leave a message.

813
01:03:50,242 --> 01:03:51,994
Grace? Are you there?

814
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:53,454
Hello? It's me.

815
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:58,918
Come on, Grace. Come to the party.

816
01:03:59,835 --> 01:04:01,962
I'll call you later, OK?

817
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:06,300
Come on, Sam.

818
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:11,222
Help me out here.

819
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:15,559
Sam, don't. Come on.

820
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:18,270
- Tell me.
- If I do, it might not come true.

821
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:22,942
What is it you want, Mary?
You want the moon?

822
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:26,487
Say the word and I'll throw a lasso
around it and pull it down.

823
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:30,449
H.ey, that's a pretty good idea.
I'll give you the moon, Mary.

824
01:04:30,532 --> 01:04:32,534
I'll take it.

825
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:35,412
- Then what?
- Then you could swallow it.

826
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:37,706
And it'd all dissolve.

827
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:40,793
Moonbeams would shoot out
of your fingers and toes

828
01:04:40,876 --> 01:04:43,337
and the ends of your hair.

829
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:56,976
This is Bruce, Grace and Sam.

830
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:00,896
Hi, Bruce.

831
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:05,150
What are you doing in here all alone?

832
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:07,027
Oh, I was just going to...

833
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:09,196
I mean...

834
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:14,368
I was going to give Grace a call.

835
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:18,455
Yeah, I didn't see her.
So how are you and Grace doing?

836
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:22,209
Well, actually, we had a bit of a fight.

837
01:05:22,918 --> 01:05:25,713
Kind of. I'm not sure if she's...

838
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:27,965
You're on fire, Bruce.

839
01:05:28,465 --> 01:05:30,134
Some women can't handle fire.

840
01:05:31,468 --> 01:05:33,596
Some can.

841
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:38,392
That's interesting, cos I never
thought we would ever talk...

842
01:05:58,954 --> 01:06:01,790
You might want to stop
touching me now.

843
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:08,172
Grace, come here!

844
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:11,300
This is weird. I was just calling you.

845
01:06:11,383 --> 01:06:13,886
And you thought Susan's mouth
was the phone?

846
01:06:14,803 --> 01:06:17,389
She kissed me. I'm the kissee.

847
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:19,516
You were putting up a big fight.

848
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,186
I tried to stop her,
but she's really strong.

849
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:24,939
OK, I screwed up.
Can I make it up to you?

850
01:06:25,022 --> 01:06:27,816
Yeah. Why don't you get me a boat?

851
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,652
- What?
- A big boat.

852
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:31,695
And maybe two big bags of cash.

853
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:33,739
Then, then, I'll be happy.

854
01:06:33,822 --> 01:06:35,824
Lots of money and lots of stuff!

855
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:40,704
People want crap like getting married
or having babies with the man they love.

856
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:43,290
But not me, Bruce.
Just give me the boat.

857
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:46,669
No wonder you stayed single!

858
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:50,923
- Don't do this.
- I'm not doing this. I'm undoing it.

859
01:06:51,006 --> 01:06:54,760
I'll be at Debbie's. Take care of Sam
until I make arrangements.

860
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:58,639
You can't leave me.

861
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,393
I'm the Alpha, lady!

862
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:05,396
I'm the Omega, baby!

863
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:08,482
Fine! I don't need you!

864
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:18,909
What's the matter, Bruce?
She can't handle a little competition?

865
01:07:20,035 --> 01:07:22,413
Game's been called
on account of rain.

866
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:42,391
An unusually high number of lottery
winners has officials concerned.

867
01:07:42,474 --> 01:07:45,269
So far, 1, 100 winning tickets
have been turned in,

868
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:48,314
all, strangely, from the Buffalo area.

869
01:07:49,356 --> 01:07:51,567
More on this story as it develops.

870
01:07:52,693 --> 01:07:54,570
Enjoying your party?

871
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:58,032
Nothing like spending quality time
with great friends.

872
01:07:59,783 --> 01:08:03,537
- Grace left me.
- Yeah, I know.

873
01:08:03,996 --> 01:08:06,081
She'll take me back.

874
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:12,046
- She'll take me back, right?
- Would you take you back?

875
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:22,806
How do you make somebody love you
without affecting free will?

876
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:24,975
Welcome to my world, son.

877
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:28,020
You come up with an answer
to that one, you let me know.

878
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:40,241
Rise and shine, Buffalo.

879
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:43,452
It's 70 and sunny and the perfect day
to forgive Bruce.

880
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:46,372
I don't know much

881
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:51,335
But I know I love you

882
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,465
- Bye.
- Have fun.

883
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:25,452
- Hi. Can I get a small coffee to go?
- Sure, hon. Just a sec.

884
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:30,416
K-Tel Records brings you the 100
greatest love songs of all time.

885
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:33,961
You'll hear such classics as
"All You Need Is Bruce",

886
01:09:34,044 --> 01:09:37,548
"If You Can't Be With The One
You Love, Then Love Bruce",

887
01:09:37,631 --> 01:09:40,134
"Do That To Bruce One More Time".

888
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:41,927
Who can forget that classic,

889
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:45,222
"Bruce So H.orny
(H.e Love You Long Time)"?

890
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:48,183
Order today and we'll throw in
at no extra charge

891
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:50,436
the video "Sweatin' To Bruce".

892
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:53,439
Just dial 1-900-FORGIVE H.IM.

893
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:57,192
That's 1-900-FORGIVE H.IM. Do it now.

894
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:28,599
No, no! Please don't put that
in your mouth.

895
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:30,059
That's not food.

896
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:34,396
Go to the bathroom. Wash out your mouth.
Wash off your hands.

897
01:10:34,813 --> 01:10:37,274
That kid is gonna poop an ornament.

898
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:40,444
One more time,
you're going to be in a lot of trouble.

899
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:43,989
All right, that's it!

900
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:49,578
I surrender!

901
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:57,002
Hi.

902
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:03,884
I'm... doing my first anchor tonight.

903
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:06,887
Oh, wow. That's great!

904
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:10,891
- How have you been doing?
- Good.

905
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,021
- Debbie won the lottery.
- Oh, yeah? You're kidding.

906
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:22,486
But so did 400,000 other people,
so she only won like $1 7 or something.

907
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,615
I miss you.

908
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,372
I took a first step.

909
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:35,541
Jumped out on a ledge.

910
01:11:37,334 --> 01:11:40,254
- Feeling vulnerable.
- What do you want me to say?

911
01:11:40,337 --> 01:11:42,548
Say you want me back.

912
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:44,967
What about all the signs?

913
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:49,388
How did you know about that?
Did you talk to Debbie?

914
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:52,516
Would it help if I just said
I was a complete ass?

915
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:56,228
- You said ass!
- It's OK if I'm talking about a donkey.

916
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,814
I didn't say "hole". If I said ass...

917
01:11:58,898 --> 01:12:01,734
No, wait. OK, honey, let's go inside.

918
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:04,862
All right, everybody inside.
Time to go inside.

919
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:10,075
Please. None of this
seems right without you.

920
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:16,373
I gotta go.

921
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:18,542
Wait!

922
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:27,426
How do you feel now?

923
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:32,514
Have you completely lost your mind?

924
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:36,352
- Are you drunk?
- Yeah. Drunk with power.

925
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,234
Love me.

926
01:12:50,574 --> 01:12:52,660
I did.

927
01:13:04,672 --> 01:13:06,715
Yeah, I know. Free will.

928
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:12,596
More power outages reported today
caused by last week's meteorite strike.

929
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:18,894
Officials are trying to repair transformers
damaged by the ensuing electrical surge.

930
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:20,896
The scene nearly turned violent

931
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:25,943
when Buffalo residents protested
last week's lottery results.

932
01:13:26,026 --> 01:13:29,822
Doomsayers are pointing to
last week's strange celestial events

933
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:35,244
as signs that prophecy is being fulfilled
and the world may be coming to an end.

934
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:38,330
The world's gone mad.

935
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,374
- 30 seconds to air.
- OK.

936
01:13:40,457 --> 01:13:43,377
There you are. It's your debut.
How are you feeling?

937
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:46,630
You know what? I'm fine. Never better.

938
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:49,300
The show must go on right?

939
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:55,723
-The Sabres just won the Stanley Cup.
- You're kidding me!

940
01:13:56,348 --> 01:13:59,059
Was that tonight? That's great.

941
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:03,647
It's crazy out there. We're going to
kick live to Fred at the stadium, OK?

942
01:14:03,731 --> 01:14:06,233
- Five seconds to the open.
- This is it.

943
01:14:06,317 --> 01:14:08,319
- You ready?
- Born that way.

944
01:14:08,402 --> 01:14:13,908
Welcome to Eyewitness News at Six,
with Susan Ortega, Bruce Nolan,

945
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:16,744
Fred Donohue, sports,
Dallas Coleman, weather.

946
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:18,829
Now Buffalo's number one news team.

947
01:14:18,913 --> 01:14:20,998
- I'm Susan Ortega.
- I'm Bruce Nolan.

948
01:14:21,081 --> 01:14:23,167
And here's what's making news.

949
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,046
- What happened?
- We lost power.

950
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:29,215
- Transformer's down again.
- Jeez.

951
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:31,842
Ever since that damn meteorite hit.

952
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:36,305
- We're back.
- We apologize for the interruption.

953
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:38,599
- Back to the news. Bruce?
- Thank you.

954
01:14:38,682 --> 01:14:41,769
I'm sorry. We're going live
to HSBC Arena,

955
01:14:41,852 --> 01:14:44,980
where the Buffalo Sabres
have won the Stanley Cup.

956
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:46,440
- Great.
- Fred?

957
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:49,193
We're about to uncork
some champagne because

958
01:14:49,276 --> 01:14:54,031
the Sabres have won
their first championship in 22 years!

959
01:14:56,534 --> 01:14:57,952
What in blazes...

960
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:02,748
We'll be back with the Sabres'
victory in just a hot second.

961
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:04,667
In other news...

962
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,336
- Bloody hell!
- What is it now?

963
01:15:07,419 --> 01:15:09,505
- The whole booth is down.
- It's not!

964
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:15,553
In other news, fighting erupted
in the Gaza Strip today,

965
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:17,763
as Israelis and Palestinians...

966
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:19,265
- Bruce.
- What?

967
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:22,685
We've got a situation here.
They're rioting right outside.

968
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:25,604
- You're kidding.
- The whole town has gone crazy.

969
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:32,611
Go on, Bruce. Say something.

970
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:37,116
Ladies and gentlemen, this just in.

971
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:43,330
Possibly the biggest breaking news
story this town has ever seen.

972
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:52,631
And I gotta go.

973
01:15:53,465 --> 01:15:55,551
Sorry, Jack.

974
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:58,512
Susan, it's all yours.

975
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:04,018
Sabres!

976
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:06,353
Sabres rule!

977
01:16:06,437 --> 01:16:08,856
Down with the lottery!

978
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:11,191
Repent! The end is near!

979
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:27,333
The lottery sucks!

980
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:29,710
I only won 1 7 bucks!

981
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:34,089
Channel 7 lies!

982
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:37,843
Oh, no!

983
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:52,358
God!

984
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:56,612
God?

985
01:16:57,404 --> 01:16:59,490
Are you here?

986
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:04,828
Hello? I need your help!

987
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:08,207
Clap on!

988
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:18,175
Figures!

989
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:23,889
Well, hello there, Bruce Almighty.

990
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:30,980
Not as easy as it looks, is it, son?
This God business.

991
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:34,567
They're all out of control.

992
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,819
It's me. I don't know what to do.

993
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:39,947
Well, you're right on time.
Seven o'clock.

994
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:45,411
The 7th at 7.00.

995
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:02,094
All righty, then.

996
01:18:04,471 --> 01:18:07,433
- There we are.
- It's good.

997
01:18:09,727 --> 01:18:11,353
It's a wonderful thing.

998
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:16,442
No matter how filthy something gets,
you can always clean it right up.

999
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:20,821
There were so many.
I just gave them all what they wanted.

1000
01:18:20,905 --> 01:18:22,573
Yeah.

1001
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:26,619
But since when does anyone
have a clue about what they want?

1002
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:32,082
So what do I do?

1003
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:39,006
Parting your soup is not a miracle.
It's a magic trick.

1004
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:42,384
A single mom who's working two jobs

1005
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:46,513
and still finds time to take her kid
to soccer practice, that's a miracle.

1006
01:18:46,931 --> 01:18:50,392
A teenager who says no to drugs
and yes to an education,

1007
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:53,354
that's a miracle.

1008
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:56,523
People want me to do everything for them.

1009
01:18:56,607 --> 01:18:59,693
What they don't realize
is they have the power.

1010
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:03,739
You want to see a miracle, son?

1011
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:05,908
Be the miracle.

1012
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:11,330
Wait. Are you leaving?

1013
01:19:11,956 --> 01:19:14,792
Yeah. I figure you can handle things now.

1014
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:17,670
But what if I need you?
What if I have questions?

1015
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:20,172
That's your problem, Bruce.

1016
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:22,299
That's everybody's problem.

1017
01:19:22,383 --> 01:19:24,468
You keep looking up.

1018
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:32,518
Order has been restored
after this evening's downtown riot.

1019
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,396
State officials
have suspended all lottery sales

1020
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:37,523
pending further investigation.

1021
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:42,278
No injuries were reported in the melee,
however there were dozens of arrests.

1022
01:20:30,284 --> 01:20:31,952
OK.

1023
01:20:33,287 --> 01:20:35,289
- Thanks a million.
- Not a problem.

1024
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:37,458
God bless.

1025
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:46,342
Bruce giveth and Bruce... taketh away.

1026
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:49,094
If you don't like it... mega-bite me.

1027
01:20:57,603 --> 01:20:59,855
- Evan?
- Bruce.

1028
01:21:02,942 --> 01:21:08,030
I suppose you're here to gloat about
the anchor position. Go ahead.

1029
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:10,199
Well, actually, I...

1030
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:14,787
I just came to tell you
that I've been a royal prick.

1031
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:17,706
The anchor position is yours.
I turned down the job.

1032
01:21:18,582 --> 01:21:21,001
And I never really congratulated you.

1033
01:21:22,753 --> 01:21:24,838
Congratulations.

1034
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:28,759
Thanks, Bruce.

1035
01:21:28,842 --> 01:21:31,845
In the financial world,
things are back to normal

1036
01:21:31,929 --> 01:21:35,140
in what analysts are calling
a fluke market fluctuation.

1037
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:37,893
- You made the right move.
- What about you?

1038
01:21:37,977 --> 01:21:40,187
You ready to go back out there?

1039
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:44,066
Do the cutesy stuff?
The lighter side of the news?

1040
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:47,987
Lower and debase myself
for the amusement of strangers?

1041
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:50,447
Yeah, I could do that.
Sounds like fun.

1042
01:21:50,531 --> 01:21:52,116
Good.

1043
01:21:52,867 --> 01:21:56,245
OK, Sammy, let's do it right.
Like all the other dogs.

1044
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:59,999
I don't want to make you feel bad,
but they're laughing at you, pal.

1045
01:22:00,082 --> 01:22:02,293
Come on. Concentrate.

1046
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:04,628
Pump it out, if you have to.

1047
01:22:04,712 --> 01:22:07,214
What am I going to do with you?

1048
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:12,428
I know this seems kind of crazy,

1049
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:16,640
but desperate times
call for desperate measures.

1050
01:22:18,976 --> 01:22:21,687
OK, Sammy. Do your thing.

1051
01:22:22,563 --> 01:22:25,649
That's it. Good boy!

1052
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:29,737
Training my dog.

1053
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:52,635
Yes! We did it!

1054
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:58,641
We're doing it doggy style

1055
01:23:00,017 --> 01:23:02,311
I'll alert Penthouse Forum.

1056
01:23:02,394 --> 01:23:04,480
Hi, Deb. How are you?

1057
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:06,690
How's Grace?

1058
01:23:06,774 --> 01:23:09,610
I didn't come to chat.
I came for Grace's stuff.

1059
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:18,869
- You need a...?
- That's OK. I've got it.

1060
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:27,962
I don't know if she...

1061
01:23:28,045 --> 01:23:30,548
I don't know
if she wants that or not.

1062
01:23:34,552 --> 01:23:37,680
This is full. You did all this?

1063
01:23:48,524 --> 01:23:50,943
You know what I do before I go to bed?

1064
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:54,864
I tuck my kids in, maybe have
some ice cream and watch Conan.

1065
01:23:56,699 --> 01:23:58,784
Know what Grace does?

1066
01:23:59,994 --> 01:24:02,079
She prays.

1067
01:24:03,247 --> 01:24:05,082
Most of the time for you.

1068
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:30,441
Find Grace Connelly.

1069
01:24:33,235 --> 01:24:35,362
The woman does pray a lot.

1070
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:40,075
Find... Grace and Bruce.

1071
01:24:41,285 --> 01:24:43,704
"Dear God,
please help Bruce find himself,

1072
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:45,831
find contentment, find you."

1073
01:24:45,915 --> 01:24:49,501
"Dear God, please help Bruce.
He seems to be struggling."

1074
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:51,629
"Dear God, give Bruce strength."

1075
01:24:51,712 --> 01:24:53,505
"Dear God, bless Bruce."

1076
01:24:58,385 --> 01:25:00,304
It's her.

1077
01:25:00,888 --> 01:25:04,183
Sammy, she's logging on.
She's praying right now.

1078
01:25:11,482 --> 01:25:13,275
Please, God.

1079
01:25:14,902 --> 01:25:16,278
Please.

1080
01:25:16,362 --> 01:25:18,405
I still love him.

1081
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:23,827
But I don't want to love him any more.

1082
01:25:23,911 --> 01:25:26,413
I don't want to hurt any more. Please.

1083
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:29,124
Help me forget.

1084
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:31,961
Please help me to let it go.

1085
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:35,464
Please help me let him go.

1086
01:25:56,569 --> 01:25:58,654
You win!

1087
01:25:59,363 --> 01:26:01,240
I'm done!

1088
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:05,160
Please! I don't want to do this any more!

1089
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:08,205
I don't want to be God.

1090
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:12,334
I want you to decide
what's right for me!

1091
01:26:12,418 --> 01:26:15,254
I surrender to your will!

1092
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:46,911
Am I...?

1093
01:26:46,994 --> 01:26:50,998
You can't kneel down in the middle
of a highway and live to talk about it.

1094
01:26:51,081 --> 01:26:53,167
But why?

1095
01:26:54,418 --> 01:26:56,086
Why now?

1096
01:26:56,170 --> 01:26:57,796
Bruce...

1097
01:26:58,756 --> 01:27:01,592
you have the divine spark.

1098
01:27:01,675 --> 01:27:05,638
You have the gift for bringing joy
and laughter to the world.

1099
01:27:06,764 --> 01:27:08,849
I know. I created you.

1100
01:27:10,267 --> 01:27:12,645
- Quit bragging.
- See?

1101
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:15,022
That's what I'm talking about.

1102
01:27:15,105 --> 01:27:17,191
That's the spark.

1103
01:27:22,029 --> 01:27:24,240
What do you want me to do?

1104
01:27:25,241 --> 01:27:27,159
I want you to pray, son.

1105
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:30,913
Go ahead. Use them.

1106
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:39,880
Lord, feed the hungry.

1107
01:27:39,964 --> 01:27:43,384
And bring peace to...

1108
01:27:44,885 --> 01:27:46,971
all of mankind.

1109
01:27:49,014 --> 01:27:51,308
- How's that?
- Great.

1110
01:27:51,392 --> 01:27:54,186
If you want to be Miss America.

1111
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:57,856
Now, come on.
What do you really care about?

1112
01:28:02,361 --> 01:28:04,738
Grace.

1113
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:09,702
You want her back?

1114
01:28:14,123 --> 01:28:16,208
No.

1115
01:28:17,334 --> 01:28:19,420
I want her to be happy.

1116
01:28:21,755 --> 01:28:24,216
No matter what that means.

1117
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:26,594
I want her to find someone

1118
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:28,762
who'll treat her

1119
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:34,476
with all the love she deserved from me.

1120
01:28:37,104 --> 01:28:39,189
I want her to meet someone

1121
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:46,572
who'll see her always

1122
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:49,825
as I do now.

1123
01:28:54,455 --> 01:28:56,665
Through your eyes.

1124
01:28:57,291 --> 01:29:00,085
- Now that's a prayer.
- Yeah?

1125
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:04,632
Yeah. It's good.

1126
01:29:09,845 --> 01:29:12,056
I'm going to get right on it.

1127
01:29:12,890 --> 01:29:14,850
Clear!

1128
01:29:14,934 --> 01:29:17,394
That didn't feel very good.

1129
01:29:18,354 --> 01:29:21,232
- Got a rhythm.
- I got a pulse.

1130
01:29:21,315 --> 01:29:24,401
- Let's get him up.
- Get the backboard and brace.

1131
01:29:34,995 --> 01:29:37,081
Welcome back.

1132
01:29:37,164 --> 01:29:39,375
You're lucky to be alive, son.

1133
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:41,544
Someone up there must like you.

1134
01:29:56,850 --> 01:30:01,146
I hear all that stuff winds up
in a warehouse somewhere.

1135
01:30:06,944 --> 01:30:09,029
Hi, baby.

1136
01:30:10,865 --> 01:30:14,577
Oh, my God, look at you.

1137
01:30:14,994 --> 01:30:18,080
- I was such an idiot.
- It's OK.

1138
01:30:25,421 --> 01:30:28,299
I don't know what I would have done.

1139
01:30:29,133 --> 01:30:33,721
Oh, God. I swear I wanted
to be mad at you forever.

1140
01:30:45,649 --> 01:30:47,735
Now you're just showing off.

1141
01:30:59,246 --> 01:31:03,292
This is Bruce Nolan here at Buffalo's
first "Be the Miracle" blood drive.

1142
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:06,295
It's a B-E-A-utiful day.

1143
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:09,798
So come on down,
because the life you save could be mine.

1144
01:31:10,216 --> 01:31:15,179
Let's go over here. The Kowolskis have
baked a cookie just for this occasion.

1145
01:31:15,262 --> 01:31:18,390
Sure it's a creepy and a shameless plug,
but we love 'em.

1146
01:31:18,474 --> 01:31:20,684
Thank you, Mama. Vol - finger, nose.

1147
01:31:22,728 --> 01:31:25,064
I will have given blood
twice this week.

1148
01:31:25,147 --> 01:31:27,441
For those of you who haven't heard,

1149
01:31:27,524 --> 01:31:31,153
I'd like to introduce you
to the future Mrs Exclusive.

1150
01:31:31,237 --> 01:31:34,406
Grace Connelly. There she is.

1151
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:37,952
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful?

1152
01:31:39,119 --> 01:31:43,207
She just gave blood and she still
has enough left to fill up her face.

1153
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:47,211
Yes, behind every great man,
there's a woman rolling her eyes, folks.

1154
01:31:47,294 --> 01:31:51,882
I'm Bruce Nolan for Eyewitness News
reminding you to...

1155
01:31:51,966 --> 01:31:54,927
Be the miracle!

1156
01:31:55,844 --> 01:31:57,346
You heard 'em.

1157
01:31:57,429 --> 01:32:00,724
- OK, cut it. Thank you, Bruce.
- Thanks, Ally.

1158
01:32:04,061 --> 01:32:07,523
- How was that?
- Great. That was really great.

1159
01:32:07,606 --> 01:32:10,025
Now go over there.
The nurse is waiting.

1160
01:32:10,109 --> 01:32:12,403
- Do I have to?
- Oh, it's not going to hurt.

1161
01:32:12,486 --> 01:32:14,989
In fact, I think you'll find it pleasurable.

1162
01:32:15,364 --> 01:32:17,157
Baby.

1163
01:33:14,298 --> 01:33:19,428
Who can take a rainbow,
wrap it in a sock

1164
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:24,892
Soak it in the sun
and make a groovy lemon pie?

1165
01:33:30,856 --> 01:33:32,983
Oh, Jesus.

1166
01:33:34,276 --> 01:33:35,444
I'm sorry.

1167
01:33:35,528 --> 01:33:39,573
I'm a very rare blood type. I'm AB positive.

1168
01:33:40,491 --> 01:33:42,576
Sounds delicious.

1169
01:33:45,412 --> 01:33:48,290
Well, there are storehouses
all over the world

1170
01:33:48,374 --> 01:33:51,919
with tons of stuff on ice, and...

1171
01:33:52,795 --> 01:33:55,548
- Sorry.
- You were like this. Sorry, go on.

1172
01:33:57,383 --> 01:33:59,677
Positive, IB positive... Sorry.

1173
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,845
I have a rary...

1174
01:34:03,472 --> 01:34:05,558
She has a rary!

1175
01:34:05,641 --> 01:34:08,102
I have a very rare blood type.

1176
01:34:08,185 --> 01:34:09,812
I'm AB negative.

1177
01:34:09,895 --> 01:34:11,981
- I'm IB positive.
- Am I AB negative?

1178
01:34:12,064 --> 01:34:14,191
I don't know what you are any more.

1179
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:18,529
I'm going to need a frickin' miracle
to get to work on time.

1180
01:34:41,218 --> 01:34:43,095
That'll work.

1181
01:34:43,178 --> 01:34:47,182
Other stories in the...

1182
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:54,481
The prime minister of Sweden
visited Washington today,

1183
01:34:54,565 --> 01:34:58,027
and in other...

01:35:14,293 --> 01:35:16,378
Eyewitness Nose.

1188
01:35:17,046 --> 01:35:19,131
And clear!

1189
01:35:19,632 --> 01:35:21,675
Be the miracle!

1190
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:23,886
That's right!
