哈哈，不管怎样，这是一个梳妆台，所以我要两份
Ha- ha, either way, it's a vanity plate, so I get doubles.

25
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,120
-天啊，嘿…

-哦,亲爱的
- Oh dear.

33
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,030
那是同一辆卡车吗?
Is that the same truck?

34
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,670
-我不认为我们应该看到这个
- I don't think we were supposed to see that.

35
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,100
-这是怎么回事…?

36
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,000

没有发生在我们身上

-我不喜欢，罗尼
- Oh, I don't like it, Ronnie.

61

我一点也不喜欢
I don't like it one bit.

62
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,310
-是“我要打败你了?”
- Was it "I'M BEATING U?"

63
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,830
-我不知道
- I don't know.

64
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,250
-好吧，好吧，好吧

-罗尼?
- Ronnie?

75
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,920
我们应该停下来看看床单是怎么回事
- We should stop and see what was going on with that sheet.

76
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,230
然后我们就可以把一切都告诉警察了
And then we can tell the cops all about it.

77
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,690
我们必须这么做，玛丽
We gotta do it, Marie.

78
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,940
-熟视无睹是不行的

79
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,290
-爱你，宝贝
- Love you, baby.

80
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,320
-罗纳德·…

00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,120

录音:可怕的景象
recorded voice: The horrifying sight

86
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,210
警方认为罗恩和玛丽在那天目睹了
that police believe Ron and Marie witnessed that day

87
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,730
就是坑里那些臭名昭著的尸体
was the infamous bodies in the pit.

88
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,180
从那以后，罗恩和玛丽就再也没有出现过
Ron and Marie themselves have never been seen since.

89
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,870
又是一个来自南方深处的恐怖谜团

90
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,770
-那个视频你肯定看过很多遍了

91
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,360

其实就在这附近

97

-是啊，今晚你就能见到他们所有人的粉丝了
- Yeah, and you'll be meeting fans of all of them by tonight.

-真不敢相信我居然让你拉我来这个书呆子聚会
- I can't believe I let you drag me to this nerd fest.

105
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,570
-是吗?解释我这个
- Yeah? Explain me this.

106
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,570
这是真实的录像
Now, this is real footage.

107
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,400
即使你也不能否认
Even you can't deny it.

108
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,750
-你甚至看不见它
- You can't even see it.

109
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,510
有没有想过为什么那些证明视频总是摇摇晃晃的
Ever wonder why those proof videos are always shaky

110
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,820
浑浊，从不清脆清澈?
and murky, never crisp and clear?

111
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,550
-这是老了

00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,730
-你宝贵的科学没有所有的答案!

过了23天…

133
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,180

00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,660
-然后就消失了我不知道

-听起来像爱虫

它们是实验室里用来杀死蚊子的一种虫子
They were a breed of bugs made in a lab to kill mosquitos.

137

现在它们毫无用处
Now they serve zero purpose.

140
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,500
它们没有功能，

但它们每年会像风暴一样出现两次，

盲目追逐白色的东西
blindly chasing anything white

143
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,340
当他们接触到它的时候就会死亡
before dying when they come into contact with it.

144
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:59,270
-所以你认为爬行者是在实验室里制造的
- So, you think the Creeper was made in a lab.

145
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,450
-我觉得爬行者是在你脑子里造出来的，你个笨蛋
- I think the Creeper was made in your brain, you half-wit.

146
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,800
-爬行者是不会交配的
- Well, the Creeper doesn't mate.

147
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,080
它会杀死……
It kills...

148
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,530
据说它杀死了几百人，甚至几千人
It's said to have killed almost hundreds, maybe thousands.

149
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,320
-等等，他们不是把它拍成电影了吗?
- Wait, didn't they make a movie out of it?

150
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,530
变态爬行者还是什么?
Creepy Creeper or something?

151
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:20,230
-其实是三个，但都不是真的
- Three actually, but none of that is real.

152
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:25,650
它是以一个俗气的洛杉矶有线电视节目命名的…
And it was named after a cheesy LA cable access show...

153
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,850
宝贝?宝贝!
Baby? Baby!

154
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,240
莱恩!
Laine!

155
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,520
-宝贝，我告诉过你玉米煎饼会回来的
- Baby, I told you that burrito would come back

156
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,310
困扰你
to haunt you.

157
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,760
好吧，你知道我打字很烂
all right, you know I suck at typing.

158
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,010
我今晚就去问她
I'm gonna ask her tonight.

159
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,460
我拿到戒指了，所以…
I've got the ring so...

160
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,740
祝我好运吧
Wish me luck.

161
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,750
我爱你，妈妈
I love you, Mom.

162
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,890
-怎么了，姑娘?
- What is up girl?

163
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,030
你好吗?
How are you?

164
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,310
-一切都很疼，我快死了
- Everything hurts and I'm dying.

165
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,070
-哦，很好吧?
- Oh, that good, huh?

166
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,170
-你还好吗?
- Ew, are you all right?

167
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,320
-对我来说太晚了，救你自己吧
- It's too late for me, save yourself.

168
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,770
-你考试了吗?
- So, did you take the test yet?

169
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,250
-我把它带来了
- I brought it with me,

170
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,670
但我认为这是积极的
but I think this counts as a positive.

171
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,600
-你总是那么乐观
- You are always the optimist.

172
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,780
-我不是这个意思，你知道的
- Not at all what I meant and you know it.

173
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,570
-嗯，我想等我到的时候再说
- Well, I was trying to hold it till I got there,

174
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,680
但我要撒尿，裁缝，我的士兵间谍
but I need to tinkle, tailor, my soldier spy.

175
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,990
我待会再打给你
I'm gonna have to call you back.

176
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,270
-我听不进去
- I'm not hearing this.

177
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,860
到了酒店给我打电话，好吗?
Just call me when you get to the hotel, okay?

178
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,240
记得别吐在那些空军一号上
Oh, make sure that you do not puke on those Air Force Ones.

179
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,900
-别拿这个开玩笑
- Don't even joke about that.

180
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,870
-莱恩，我什么时候拿时尚开玩笑过?
- Laine, when have I ever joked about fashion?

181
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,910
-萨姆，我发誓如果你给我施了恶咒
- Sam, I swear if you jinxed me,

182
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,390
我发誓我会…
I swear to God I'll...

183
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,810
-莱恩，我爱你，但你得给我多买几双鞋
- Laine, I love you, but you're buying me some more shoes.

184
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,090
靠……
Fuck...

185
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,340
我看起来像是为丛林而生的吗?
Do I look like I'm built for the woods?

186
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,600
-你带我到最迷人的地方
- You bring me to the most charming places.

187
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,020
提醒我一下我们为什么在这里?
Remind me why we're here again?

188
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,430
-宝贝，我等不及带你去看看这个地方了
- Baby, I can't wait to show you this place.

189
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,190
-你确定我们应该来这里吗?
- Are you sure this is where we're supposed to be?

190
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,780
-是啊，我们应该很接近
- Yeah, we should be close.

191
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,030
现在你知道我们要去哪里了…
Now you know that's where we're going...

192
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,820
-真的吗?
- Really?

193
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,450
-马尼拉夫人，你怎么能不呢?
- Lady Manilla, how could you not?!

194
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,520
嘿，也许她会给你看手相
Hey, maybe she'll read your palm.

195
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,550
是啊!
Yeah!

196
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,020
-相信你能找到最奇怪的人
- Trust you to find the strangest

197
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,510
问路的地方
place to ask for directions.

198
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,960
-该死，看看这些酷东西
- Damn, look at all this cool stuff.

199
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,350
-我不明白
- I don't get it.

200
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,250
走吧，蔡斯，没人，我们走
Come on, Chase, nobody's here, let's go.

201
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,840
蔡斯，别碰所有东西
Chase, don't touch everything.

202
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,120
你吓死我了!
You scared the shit out of me!

203
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,500
-看看这个
- Take a look at this.

204
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,270
我不知道他们在离海岸这么远的地方捕鲸
I didn't know they had whaling this far from the coast.

205
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,410

-我们在找这个地址
- We're looking for this address,

207
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,720
但我在地图上都找不到

208
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,350
-啊，地图上没有
- Ah, it's not on any maps.

209
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,350
卫星有点坏了
The satellites are kind of screwed up

210
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,080
我想是在我们小镇上空
over our town I guess.

211
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,610
在那里
There.

212
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,820

216
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,290
-没有问题

一共50美元，可以吗?

218
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,430
- 50,\n- 50--

219
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,220

她也不知道
Neither does she.

225
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,810
有趣
Interesting.

226
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,360
-好吧，这是…
- Okay, this was, er...

227
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:14,660
-我们有一棵结果的树
- We have a tree bearing fruit.

228

-蔡斯，你要去哪?

235
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,200
-嘿，我是萨姆

我把需要的东西都带来了
I brought everything we need.

245
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,030
你要做的就是选择你想成为的人
All you need to do is choose who you wanna be.

246
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,480
-我不会穿的

247

是啊，反正这主意也太蠢了

250
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:42,980
我是说，我知道你不会穿这些东西
So, I mean, I knew you wouldn't wear some of this stuff.

251
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:46,080
反正也很俗气，所以我不想让你穿
It's tacky anyway, so I don't even want you to wear it.

252
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,290
也许我会穿它
Maybe I'll wear it.

但我说我们都是好的

269
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,460

00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,150
-没错，当地的恐怖传说，爬行者
- That's right, local horror legend, the Creeper.

-不是普通的t恤
- Not just any T-shirt.

276

这件t恤
This T-shirt.

00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,960
-我该拿你怎么办?
- What am I gonna do with you?

278
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,350
-莱恩? !
- Laine?!

279
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,420
宝贝，你没事吧?

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,090
让我们开始…
Let's start going...

284
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,820
这是派对时间
It's party time.

285
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,170
来吧
Come on.

286
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:07,760
-我不知道会有这么多人参加
- I had no idea so many people attended these things.

287
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:11,560
-这是cosplay界的科切拉
- This is the Coachella of cosplay.

288
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,800
-是啊，对变态杀手来说
- Yeah, for psycho killers.

289
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,700
看起来像一群杂耍鬼
It looks like a gathering of juggalos.

290
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,420
-拜托，你喜欢疯狂小丑团
- Oh please, you love Insane Clown Posse.

291
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,670
我看过你的Spotify
I've seen your Spotify.

292
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,630
-离我的手机远点，你这个跟踪狂!
- Stay off my phone you stalker!

293
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,710
-天使回答说
- And the angel answered and

294
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,190
对百姓说，
said unto the people,

295
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:29,990
你们不要惧怕，因为我知道你们寻求
fear not, ye, for I know ye seek

296
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,330
弥赛亚
the Messiah.

297
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,100
因为它已经复活了
For it is risen.

298
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,990
所有喊:哈利路亚!
all shout: Hallelujah!

299
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,240
-我很确定正确的说法是“他复活了”
- I'm pretty sure the correct phrase is, "He is risen."

300
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,920
-耶稣基督!
- Jesus Christ!

301
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,100
没错，欢迎来到恐怖猎犬!
That's right, welcome to Horror Hound!

302
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,550
我们走吧!
Let's go!

303
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,520
-这些人真的很糟糕
-these people are really fucked up.

304
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,320
-你真该看看你的脸-勾，线，沉
- You should have seen your face--hook, line, and sinker.

305
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,260
-嘿，嘿，嘿，嘿
- Hey, hey, hey, hey,

306
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,610
-尿裤子了
- Shitting their pants.

307
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,510
他们脸上的表情
The looks on their faces.

308
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,370
糟了
Shit.

309
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,100
-他们在美化真正的杀手
- They are glorifying actual killers

310
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,210
你真的不介意吗?
and you're honestly okay with that?

311
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,830
-没有……
- No...

312
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,660
不,他们不是
No, they're not.

313
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:32,490
这一切都只是为了好玩
It's all just for fun.

314
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,420
-如果人群中潜伏着一个疯子怎么办?
- What if there's a psycho lurking in the crowd?

315
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,110
你怎么知道?
How the hell would you know?

316
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,980
-宝贝，没有疯子
- Baby, there's no psychos.

317
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,950
只是一群人在玩
Just a bunch of people having fun.

318
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,810
-即使是大型音乐节也有人数统计
- Even big music festivals have a body count.

319
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,300
我不敢想象这里是什么样子
I dread to think what it's like here.

320
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,990
人山人海，每个人都在喝酒、聚会、开车……
Crowds of people, everyone drinking, partying, cars...

321
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,130
-锋利的东西
- Sharp things.

322
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,820
-追逐…
- Chase...

323
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,860
好吧，我去拿饮料
Okay, I'll get the drinks.

324
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:57,650
嘿
Hey.

325
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,800
-我他妈现在就在做
- I'm doing that right freaking now.

326
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,700
-牌子上写着“关门”
- The sign says "closed."

327
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,820
追逐!
Chase!

328
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,960
-你割伤了自己，先生?
- You cut yourself, Sir?

329
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,850
-抱歉各位，我有事耽搁了
- Sorry folks, I got held up

330
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,480
为今晚的大演出做准备
preparing for tonight's big show.

331
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,750
特效之类的
Special effects and such.

332
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,030
没什么大不了的
No big deal.

333
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,420
五比三，从中间挑
It's three for five, pick them from the center.

334
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,980
-可以吗?-太棒了
- Is that all right? - Great.

335
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,910
-从这里?
- From here?

336
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,460
-在中间
- In the center.

337
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,050
中心-好吧，酷
Center. - All right, cool.

338
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:56,540
宝贝，退后，看我工作!
Baby, stand back and watch...me...work!

339
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,130
这是近了!
That was close!

340
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,820
我要用另一只手，好吗?
I'm gonna use my other hand, okay?

341
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,440
宝贝,你在看吗?
Babe, you watching?

342
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,170
好吧，这是我最后一个了
Ah, okay, it's my last one.

343
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,690
-你喜欢吗?
- You like that?

344
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,040
-我从没见过这样的事
- I've never seen anything like this.

345
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:14,320
-那是因为它们都是独一无二的
- That's because they're all unique.

346
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,560
每一个手工制作的
Each one handmade.

347
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,940
爬虫的风格
Creeper style.

348
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,220
你听说过爬行者吗?
You ever heard of the Creeper?

349
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,430
-别让他开口
- Don't get him started.

350
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,220
-就像当地的传说，对吧?
- It-- it's like a local legend, right?

351
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,610
每23年就杀死数百人?
Kills hundreds of people every 23 years?

352
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,710
-差不多吧
- Something like that.

353
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,890
-我告诉…
- I told...

354
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,580
-现在你试试
- Now you try.

355
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,070
-我吗?
- Me?

356
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,970
不，不
No, no, no, no, no.

357
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,930
不-你要这么做
No, no, no, no, no. - You're doing this.

358
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,690
你要这么做你这样做
You are doing this. You're doing this.

359
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,760
来，这边走
Come on, this way.

360
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,940
-成功向人类目标投掷刀片
- Successfully throwing blades at a human target

361
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,360
是一种艺术形式
was an art form.

362
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,600
现在，首先你找到你的投掷线…
Now, first you find your throwing line...

363
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:01,260
就是这个
That's this.

364
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:04,610
好了，现在是成功投掷的关键
Okay, now the key to successfully throwing

365
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,300
刀锋是你和目标之间的距离
a blade is the distance between you and the target.

366
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,720
现在，如果你找到了投掷线，
Now, if you've found your throwing line,

367
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,860
你得往后退一步
you're gonna take a step back.

368
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:16,960
然后向左转45度
And you're gonna turn 45 degrees and to your left.

369
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,280
好了，现在你要走到那条线上
Okay, now you're gonna step up to that line

370
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,560
然后像扔棒球一样扔出去
and throw it just like a baseball pitch.

371
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,280
尽你所能
Hard as you can.

372
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,630
什么!
What!

373
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:34,260
宝贝，这太变态了!
Baby, that was sick!

374
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:37,430
这和爬行者有什么关系?
So, how is this related to the Creeper?

375
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,130
-他们说这些是他最喜欢的玩具
- They say these are some of his favourite toys.

376
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,060
-似乎是低效的
- Seems inefficient.

377
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,990
-为了延长追捕时间
- To prolong the hunt.

378
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,760
有一个小缺点
There is the minor drawback that

379
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,270
即使你达到了目标
even if you hit your target,

380
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,790
你扔掉你的武器
you throw away your weapon.

381
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,760
你需要别的东西来完成任务
You need something else to finish the job.

382
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,660
或者如果爬行者像蔡斯那样投球，那他就需要
Or if the Creeper throws like Chase, then he would need it.

383
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,080
-她今天有笑话
- Oh, she got jokes today.

384
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,500
-噢!啊,该死的
- Ow! Ah, damn it.

385
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,600
-我知道了，我知道了只是割伤，只是割伤
- I got it, I got it. Just a cut, just a cut.

386
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,290
-童子军
- Boy Scout.

387
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:12,740
总是做好准备
Always be prepared.

388
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,370
-你们要来参加大型爬行者抽奖吗?
- You guys coming to the big Creeper Draw?

389
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:19,130
-有什么吸引力?
- What's the draw?

390
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,820
-午夜前开始
- Starts just before midnight after

391
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,380
主舞台上的角色扮演表演
the cosplay show on the main stage.

392
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,000
你们一定要去看看
You guys should definitely check it out.

393
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,860
谁知道呢，说不定你还能赢呢
Who knows, you might even win.

394
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,450
宝贝，没事的，只是划伤
Baby, it's all right, it's a cut.

395
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:58,030
-你没事吧，公主?
- Are you all right there, Princess?

396
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,720
-快点，快点你对吧?
- Come on, come on. You all right?

397
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,230
-嘿，你是来参加爬行者抽奖的吧?
- Hey, you're here for the Creeper Draw, right?

398
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,990
知道布伦特在哪吗?
Any idea where Brent is?

399
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,620
有人看见布伦特了吗?
Has anybody seen Brent?

400
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:07,550
任何人吗?
Anybody at all?

401
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,310
他已经做过箭的特技了吗?
Did he do the arrow stunt already?

402
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,800
-那个箭男?
- The arrow guy?

403
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,940
我们拍摄了他我们录下来了，对吧，麦奇?
We filmed him. We got it on tape, right Mikey?

404
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,970
-是啊，是啊，都录下来了
- Yeah, yeah, it's on tape.

405
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,390
-那他到底在哪儿?
- Well then, where the hell is he?

406
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,350
我是说我们五分钟后就要上台了
I mean we're supposed to be on stage in five minutes.

407
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:26,020
好吧，布伦特会为此挨揍的
All right, Brent's gonna get his ass kicked for this.

408
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,740
听着嘉莉,
Listen Carrie,

409
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,470
恐怕这次你得一个人来了
I'm afraid you're gonna have to do this one alone.

410
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,780
布伦特不在，而且都快半夜了
I mean, Brent's not here and it's nearly midnight.

411
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,950
来吧，我来教你怎么做
Come on, I'll show you the ropes.

412
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,400
很容易-完美
It's easy. - Perfect.

413
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,100
杰米，帮我拿东西好吗?
Jamie, grab my stuff please?

414
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:39,030
-你要做的就是…
- What you're gonna do is you're just gonna...

415
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,440
-在我继续之前能给我来杯姜茶吗?
- Oh, can I get a ginger tea before I go on?

416
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,000
-不，你绝对不能
- No, you absolutely cannot.

417
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,150
-好吧!
- All right!

418
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,980
谢谢你的节目，性感版的杰森
Thank you for the show, uh, sexy version of Jason, I think.

419
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,220
不管怎样,恭喜
Anyway, congrats.

420
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,950

428
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:44,060
你们这些凡人的心

429

但我们来这里是为了一件非常非常特别的事，

-我想没人知道她在说什么
- I don't think anybody knew what she was talking about.

451
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,170
但好吧，我承认，这是小众的
But okay, I give you that, it's niche.

452
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,270
还有一些人也相信这一点，
And there are other people that believe it too,

453
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:03,280
所以你也不完全是个怪胎

-你喜欢现在的每一秒，不是吗?

00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,250
清爽、清晰的光学效果没有任何区别
Crisp, clear optics makes no difference.

562
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,910
-太棒了
- Great.

563
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,940
-如果那个叫约翰的人失踪了
- If that John guy turns out to be missing

564
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,080
我们可能有线索
we might have something.

565
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,560
这是有趣的
This is interesting.

566
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:30,970
-哦,是的
- Uh, yeah.

567
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:33,910
我猜我是用手机点燃的吧?
So I guess I light this using cellphones?

568
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:39,950
-欢迎来到巴纳贝特家族墓地
- Welcome to the Barnabett family cemetery.

569
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:43,260
这是最后的安息之地
This was the final resting place

570
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,510
为了回到18世纪的灵魂
for souls back to the 1700s.

571
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:50,370
当地人认为这里是圣地
The natives believed that this was holy ground.

572
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:52,340
回到人类的黎明
Back to the dawn of man.

573
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,550
神圣的
Sacred.

574
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:59,830
但是非常非常闹鬼
But very, very haunted.

575
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,380
-太棒了
- Awesome.

576
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:03,350
我想知道我能不能葬在这里
I wonder if I could be buried here.

577
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:04,900
-小心你的愿望
- Uh, be careful what you wish for.

578
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,630
-闭嘴
- Shut up.

579
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,530
-我们怎么又来了?
- What are we doing here again?

580
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,840
我们不是该去鬼屋什么的吗?
Weren't we supposed to go to the haunted house or something?

581
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,500
-是的
- Yeah.

582
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:14,050
我们从这里走过去
We walk from here.

583
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:18,540
-看到了吗?
- You see that?

584
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:21,470
-怎么了?来吧，我们一定要拿到这个
- What's wrong? Come on, we gotta get this.

585
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,850
-相机坏了
- Camera won't work.

586
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:24,480
我不晓得
I dunno.

587
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:26,580
-不，不，不，不知道是不够的，伙计
- No, no, no, dunno ain't gonna cut it, pal.

588
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:28,070
我给你钱不是让你扳倒摄制组的
I didn't pay you to bring the film crew down

589
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,690
为我的健康干杯
to Whistling Dixie for my health.

590
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,480
你说没用是什么意思?
Now what do you mean it won't work?

591
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,000
它不能打开?它不会专注?
It doesn't turn on? It won't focus?

592
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,350
不记录?不操自己?
Won't record? Won't fuck itself?

593
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:36,900
我在这里做什么?
What am I even doing out here?

594
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,770
-没人想听起来像他那样
- See, now, nobody wants to sound like that guy.

595
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,250
-我得了艾美奖，该死的
- I have got an Emmy, God damn it.

596
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:42,600
莱恩-莱恩!
- Laine--Laine!

597
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:43,910
-我才不在乎你的艾美奖呢
- I don't give a fuck about your Emmy.

598
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,430
摄像机坏了又不是我的错
It's not my fault the camera doesn't work.

599
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:46,530
-莱恩!
- Laine!

600
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:47,600
-你去死吧
- You can go fuck yourself.

601
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,530
-你有时候真是个混蛋
- You're such an asshole sometimes.

602
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,850
-莱恩!
- Laine!

603
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:06,450
-宝贝，一切都好吗?
- Babe, is everything all right?

604
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,110
-我不知道，你说呢
- I don't know, you tell me.

605
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:10,620
一切都好吗?
Is everything all right?

606
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:13,970
-什么意思?
- What do you mean?

607
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:15,390
-我知道这里面有蹊跷
- I know there's something going on there with that

608
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,770
金发小妞和你
blonde bimbo and you.

609
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,770
说实话，我一点也不介意
Honestly, it doesn't bother me.

610
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,460
我只是觉得它太“有趣”了
I just find it so "interesting."

611
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,150
-哦，得了吧
- Oh, come on.

612
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:26,160
我都没注意到她!-真的吗?
I didn't even notice her! - Really?

613
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:29,020
“太棒了，请把我埋在这里，我是个荡妇!”
"Awesome, bury me here please, I'm a bimbo!"

614
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:30,750
你想让我给你个杯子接口水吗?
You want me to give you a cup to catch your drool?

615
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,160
-不，我没那么说
- No, I didn't say it like that.

616
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,790
这是不公平的
And that's not fair.

617
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:35,820
莱恩!
Laine!

618
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,240
-不，真的，我爱她
- No, really, I love her.

619
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:38,340
她很深沉，我知道
She's deep, I get it.

620
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,580
-拜托，我…
- Come on, I...

621
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:44,660
-你好吗?
- Hello?

622
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,590
嘿，你是参加音乐节的吗?
Hey, are you with the festival?

623
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:52,360
是我,迈克尔!
It's me, Michael!

624
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,910
相机的家伙,
The camera guy--

625
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:55,880
你有电话吗?
Do you have a phone?

626
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:01,810
我只是需要一点系绳
I just need a bit of a tethering

627
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:03,160
为了把我的东西放到网上
in order to get my stuff online.

628
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:07,130
听着，我只需要用一会儿
Look, I only need it for a bit.

629
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,510
我的制片人会杀了我的
My producer's gonna kill me

630
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,170
如果我现在不把这些东西放到网上
if I don't get this stuff online right now.

631
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:16,790
-你好吗?
- Hello?

632
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:22,460
-靠!
- Fuck!

633
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,180
奶个熊……
Well shit...

634
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:46,580
-你在找什么，你的班卓琴吗?
- What are you looking for, your banjo?

635
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:53,180
- 上帝,伙计 -靠!
- Jesus, man--fuck!

636
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:56,140
你的脸!
Your face!

637
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,940
我太逊了
Oh, I did pee myself a little.

638
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:01,940
-现在我们可以走了
- Now we can go.

639
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,120
其他人呢?
Where are the others?

640
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:04,950
-迈克尔?迈克尔!
- Michael? Michael!

641
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:10,160
-那没脑子的东西去哪了?
- Where has that no good shit for brains gone to?

642
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,890
这绝对是我和他最后一次合作了
This is definitely the last gig I'm working with him.

643
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,960
-我是YouTuber，让我离开这里!
- I'm a YouTuber, get me out of here!

644
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:17,990
-啊，没什么!
- Ugh, it was nothing!

645
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:20,100
我只是想看看录影机上有什么…
I just wanted to see what was on that vide...

646
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,480
等等，等等，等等，等等……
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...

647
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,000
你嫉妒了
You're jealous.

648
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,660
-我没有嫉妒-你嫉妒
- I'm not jealous. - You're jealous.

649
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,080
它是可爱的
it's cute.

650
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:36,120
-嫉妒是弱智的表现
- Jealousy is the sign of a weak mind.

651
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,290
-那么，女人的笑话
- So, bimbo jokes.

652
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:42,920
等待,宝贝…
Wait, baby...

653
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,930
莱恩……
Laine...

654
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:56,960

655
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,330
-也许有什么东西抓住了他?
- Maybe something got him?

656
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:22,710
像个大动物
Like a big animal.

657
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,610
-这附近没有大型动物
- There are no big animals 'round here.

658
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:26,480
-拜托，这是路易斯安那州!
- Come on, this is Louisiana!

659
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:28,550
有像…
There's like...

660
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:30,890
鳄鱼、蛇和
gators, snakes and

661
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:33,410
到处都是黑熊
black fucking bears roaming all around.

662
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:34,830
-他们不会来的
- They wouldn't come here.

663
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,380
-莱恩!
- Laine!

664
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:38,630
莱恩!
Laine!

665
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:40,970
-莱恩!-嘿,男人!

666
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:42,980
嘿，嘿，伙计，放轻松!
Hey--hey, man, take it easy!

667
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:44,150
这是怎么呢你的女朋友在哪里?
What's going on? Where's your girlfriend?

668
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,770
-有些……

669
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:50,050

00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:54,260
-我告诉过你，该死的黑熊!
- I told you, black fucking bear!

671
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,680
熊不会飞
- Bears don't fly.

672
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:57,160
冷静点，伙计
Now calm down, man.

673
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,650

00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,860
-我们得走了我们得走了，报警

-它是新鲜的真的很新鲜
- It's fresh. Really fresh.

681
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:34,270
如果他被什么东西抓走了，肯定还在外面

682
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,820
-在里面快!

683
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,770

-这就是你的逃生室吗?
- So this is your escape room, huh?

696
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:11,230
你这是在玩什么游戏吗?
Is this some kind of game you're playing here?

697
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,710
因为你可以停止表演，打开门
'Cause you can stop the show and open the door.

698
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:16,510
我们都很害怕你的乡巴佬把戏
We're all very scared of your hillbilly tricks.

699
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,820

702
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:28,970
迈克尔死了，你们都看到了

我不知道，好吗?

我根本就不应该出现在这里!

雇我来就是为了吓吓你

你现在告诉我莱恩在哪，否则
You tell me where Laine is right now or

719
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:03,870
我会把这东西插进你屁股里，
I'll stick this thing so far up your ass,

720
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,250
你会尝到该死的滋味
you'll taste the fuckin' metal.

721
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,660
-是啊，乡巴佬，该说话了
- Yeah, hillbilly, it's time to start talking.

723
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:10,080
-哇，哇，哇!
- Woah, woah, woah!

724
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:12,080
-不然我就打爆你的头!
- Or I'll blow your fuckin' brains out!

725
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,860
-我的耳朵在嗡嗡叫!
- My ears are fucking ringing!

726
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,180
-我警告过你!退一步!

727
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:40,250

-下次我再这么做，你就什么都听不到了
- Next time I do, you won't hear anything anymore.

729
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:47,050
-好吧，我们来解决这个问题
- Okay, let's figure this out.

730
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,260
这是个逃生室，对吧?
It's an escape room, right?

731
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:52,430
-这他妈不是逃跑的地方
- It's not a fucking escape room.

732
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,330
这是一个陷阱

733
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:56,950
-谁是猎人?
- And who's the trapper?

734

735
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:04,510
爬行者是个童话，孩子

-我看到了

737
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,100
-你们都他妈疯了

-它抓走了莱恩，我会找到她的
- It's got Laine and I'm gonna find her.

739
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,700
-我们原地不动-什么?
- We're staying put. - What?

740
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:18,250
别告诉我，这打乱了你繁忙的日程
Oh, don't tell me, this interrupts your hectic schedule

741
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,870
乡下乡巴佬乱伦和断断续续的爱马
of country hick incest and intermittent horse loving.

742
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:23,290
-去你的，好莱坞

我们得开始团队合作了

虽然我知道这对你来说很困难，
So as difficult as I know it is for you,

745
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:36,100
我要你别再像个混蛋一样!
I need you to stop being a fuckin' asshole!

746
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:39,060
你被我们困住了
You're stuck with us now.

747
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:40,440
把它下来
Put it down.

748
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,030
把枪放下
Put the gun down.

把枪放下
Put the gun down.

750
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,140
在我找到莱恩之前谁都不能走
Nobody's going anywhere until I find Laine.

751
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:54,630
-它的到来

752
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:05,300

我去找个开关

756
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:39,260
屋顶在漏水
The roof is leaking.

757
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,330
-但是没有下雨
- But it's not raining.

758
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:49,170
-你一定是在逗我!

759

-我不知道-她在哪里?

我不知道-她在哪里?

我们唯一的希望就是它对我们失去兴趣，
Our only hope is it loses interest in us,

794
