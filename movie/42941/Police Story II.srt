1
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,144
We managed to put Chu Tu behind bars

2
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,605
but the operation was a costly one.

3
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,441
You destroyed the squatter village

4
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,902
and the Government had to rehouse the families.

5
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,695
and pay the redemption

6
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,113
Last time, during the operation

7
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,199
You damaged the shopping centre as well.

8
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,035
We paid over a million for the chandelier alone.

9
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,840
But the taxpayers know

10
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,508
police work doesn't come cheaply.

11
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,219
But they don't expect to pay for

12
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,013
the cost of someone's heroism.

13
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:46,850
Why didn't you use the stairs?
Did you have to destroy that chandelier?

14
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,728
Do you always have to be different?

15
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:25,597
You're right. This force doesn't need superstars.

16
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,641
We need disciplined policemen.

17
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,145
l wasn't expecting a promotion.

18
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,565
Ka-kui,
the operation succeeded through team effort,

19
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,359
not just because of you.

20
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,696
You should be grateful that we didn't fire you.

21
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,615
And the bosses wanted you disciplined

22
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,409
for holding me as hostage.

23
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,995
l managed to talk them out of it.

24
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,663
l'm very grateful.

25
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,060
l worry about your individualism,

26
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,313
you're just a police officer.
Don't forget the point.

27
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:18,150
As of today, you're back in uniform.

28
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,193
You'll be assigned where needed.

29
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,404
You mean he'll be an errand boy?!

30
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,074
l think you'll be very busy.

31
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,954
Thank you, sir.

32
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,252
What else do you do apart
from giving out tickets?

33
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,815
Calling all units,

34
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,443
there's been a serious road accident
at the lndustrial Park.

35
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,986
Traffic is brought to a standstill.

36
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,905
All units in the area please respond.

37
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,805
May, go home. l'm working now.

38
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,473
Just think of me

39
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:14,891
as a member of the public.

40
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,686
And l want to talk to a policeman.

41
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,104
About what?

42
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,690
l think you look very smart in a uniform.

43
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,568
Stop it, l'm on duty.

44
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,194
l've brought you a cold drink.

45
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,120
Thank you.

46
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,581
Thank you, sir.

47
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:54,848
l can't drink here.

48
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:55,515
Go on,

49
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,683
you need a break.

50
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:57,893
lf l have a drink,

51
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:58,894
l'll need the toilet soon.

52
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,187
Come on.

53
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,064
May, l'll get into trouble.

54
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,111
Hello, superhero! You still haven't been sacked?!

55
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,323
You're lucky you're not in jail with Chu.

56
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,699
You think so?

57
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,457
The doctors said

58
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,459
l only had three months to live.

59
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,170
lt's called compassionate release.

60
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,548
Three months can pass quickly, very quickly.

61
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,761
My boss will be alive long after you're dead.

62
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,932
Don't you know you're threatening him?

63
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,643
Really? ln that case, he can sue me.

64
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:40,894
Just be careful!

65
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,354
Drive on.

66
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,026
Ka-kui?

67
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,180
Ka-Kui, Chu Tu is out from Jail.

68
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,473
l know, so?

69
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,849
You already knew? That's good then.

70
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,977
As a police who wouldn't have caught a thief?

71
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,395
who would you be scare of?

72
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,187
Just remember,

73
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,523
there are 250,000 Royal HK Police at your back up.

74
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,110
Bill, are there really 250,000 police in HK?

75
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,028
Just because we are still recruiting new blood.

76
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,363
Didn't you notice newspaper ad?

77
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,407
What are you waiting for?

78
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,700
Go on patrol!

79
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,701
Yes, sir.

80
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,620
Hey, l've talked to Raymond.

81
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:41,871
He said you could carry a gun even after work.

82
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,673
l'm very happy tonight.

83
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,342
The show and dinner were great.

84
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,927
But you don't seem very happy.

85
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,679
Really? l am happy.

86
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,183
l wish you had enjoyed it as much as l did.

87
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,604
Are you worried about Chu?

88
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,939
No. But l'm just being careful.

89
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,573
Maybe next week. . .

90
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:17,782
Hey, superhero!

91
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,286
Off duty already?

92
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,495
what are you doing here?

93
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,164
l can park here,

94
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,916
you can't give me a ticket.

95
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,337
Yeah, you must have a nice view

96
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,671
from flat B of the first floor. Am l right?

97
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,506
Go upstairs.

98
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,429
How did you find this address?

99
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,599
lt's amazing what information

100
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,226
you can get with money.

101
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:49,272
People will do anything for money, you know?

102
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:50,982
what do you mean?

103
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,735
There's a narrow stairwell in the building.

104
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,197
lf there was a fire, it'd spread

105
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,199
rapidly through the building.

106
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,993
Because of the narrow access,

107
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,412
the fire brigade couldn't get in here.

108
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,206
Therefore, you'd better

109
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,041
keep a close eye on her.

110
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,460
lf she were to get her pretty ass burnt,

111
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,672
it'd ruin her marriage prospects.

112
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:14,964
Bastard!

113
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,144
Oh, hero, l'm so happy!

114
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,112
Sorry.

115
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,322
lt'd my fault really.

116
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,616
A police like me have lots of enemies
and you are threatened.

117
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,785
l'm not scared.

118
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,870
lf you don't have any enemies,

119
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,415
that means you couldn't catch a thief.

120
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,000
Could you rehouse yourself for a while?

121
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,836
Don't worry about me.

122
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,546
They are just morons.

123
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,673
No. we could be noticed so easily while they won't

124
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:58,717
This way then,

125
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,136
l'll move to my aunt's and hide for a while.

126
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,762
Don't think about it too much.

127
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,099
But, if you threw a vase onto him
then l'll be dead definitely.

128
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,074
May.

129
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,368
Auntie.

130
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,454
You're on your own? Where's Ka-kui?

131
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,913
He's still on duty.

132
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,665
lt's OK, l can manage.

133
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,543
l'm not against you dating a policeman,

134
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:37,130
but l don't want him to spend
too much time on his work.

135
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,506
He's stubborn, too.

136
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:39,883
But he's a good policeman.

137
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,093
That's why he has lots of enemies

138
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,471
and you have to move home.

139
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,097
l have to be careful.

140
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,475
That way, he doesn't need to worry about me.

141
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,561
He ought to worry about you.

142
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:53,813
Who are they?

143
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:54,773
lt was them last time.

144
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,275
l guess superhero isn't here.

145
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,569
wait for me in the restaurant.

146
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,904
Right.

147
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,155
What do you want?

148
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,782
we have a score to settle.

149
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,617
l just want to know

150
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:06,993
where you're going.

151
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,578
lt's nothing to do with her.

152
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:13,625
You must be her mother. Am l right?

153
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,918
Bastard!

154
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,128
You call me a bastard?

155
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:20,507
Yes! l'm the bastard son of a bastard!

156
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,258
l'm not afraid of you.

157
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,384
Come on.

158
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:28,139
Auntie, why has your daughter fallen for a cop?

159
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,599
That could be dangerous.

160
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,519
Living on the 1 9th floor is dangerous, too.

161
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:37,273
What if you fall when you're cleaning the windows?

162
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,317
Go ahead!

163
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:42,904
Don't be silly.

164
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:46,783
Go away.

165
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,201
- Off! - You bastard.

166
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,410
Don't grab my hair.

167
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,620
You're hurting me.

168
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,872
You bitch.

169
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,629
Easy, she's just a girl.

170
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,548
Think yourself lucky.
lf you were a man,

171
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,259
- You'd be dead. l won't forget this.
- Come on.

172
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,927
You be careful!

173
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,304
Are you ok?

174
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,190
Auntie!

175
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,484
lt's your job that brings the enemies here.

176
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,152
Look, May was badly beaten because of you!

177
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,530
l've told you not to be with him.

178
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,533
Did John Ko attack you?

179
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,327
l started hitting him first.

180
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,580
He just hit me back.

181
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,582
And they knocked me down.

182
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,710
My backside still hurts. l can't sit down now.

183
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,628
How did they know you'd be here?

184
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,380
They followed her.

185
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,048
That's how.

186
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,676
They're watching us from across the street.

187
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,012
l wonder what's next.

188
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,806
Ka-kui, don't!

189
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,559
He should go and scold them.

190
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,185
lf it's that simple,

191
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,937
then l'll be relieved.

192
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,297
ldiot! Are you crazy?

193
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,067
what would you do beside bullying women?

194
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,445
lt's my favourite hobby.

195
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,303
Get the bastard!

196
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,962
You know the law, don't you?!

197
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,255
lf they did threaten her,

198
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,465
you could arrest them.

199
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,799
l don't care.

200
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,843
l got carried away.

201
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,470
That's not a good reason.

202
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,222
He reacted like anyone else would.

203
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,725
He's not anyone else. He's a police officer.

204
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,143
What you've done is disgraceful!

205
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,436
lt has disgraced us the police.

206
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:44,687
l don't think so.

207
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,855
lf a policeman fails to respond to

208
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:46,939
a personal threat,

209
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,691
it's disgracefu. And it disgraces the law, too.

210
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,401
You're a show-off.

211
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,861
So we won't forget you arrested Chu.

212
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,947
How can l explain this to the chief!

213
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,950
You don't have to. l quit.

214
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,754
You think that will resolve the problem?

215
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:13,758
Why not? This is probably the best solution.

216
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:15,885
l'll leave now.

217
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,515
Thank you for your support in the past. Goodbye.

218
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,727
Ka-kui.

219
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,356
lf that's your last word,

220
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,193
then try to find a less stressful job. Bye-bye.

221
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,029
l will.

222
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,407
You think you can do anything because you're cops.

223
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,659
Don't you know the law?!

224
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,538
You can't beat me up just like that.
Kill me if you can.

225
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:44,956
Shut up and sign this.

226
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,500
l'm not signing anything. No way!

227
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:50,628
l'll sue you for every penny you've got.

228
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:54,132
l've got lots of money.
l'll get a lawyer. l'll sue you!

229
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,888
What?!

230
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,223
No!

231
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,226
See? You saw this officer try to assault me.

232
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,769
He wants to beat me up like before

233
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,147
when he hit me and broke my glasses.

234
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,440
You'll pay for that.

235
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,776
You would dare to beat me up here?

236
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,779
Come on. what are you waiting for?!

237
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,575
Come on. l'm going to sue you,
you're going to jail.

238
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,337
These youngsters have no patience.

239
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,215
Bill, why didn't you ask him to stay?

240
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,425
You should have said so!

241
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,385
l thought you meant throw him out of here.

242
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,932
Now l know what this gesture means,
l'll remember it.

243
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,856
Ka-kui, what's the matter?

244
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,817
You don't want me to be a policeman, do you?

245
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:59,363
Of course l do, l'm proud of you.

246
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,490
what do l have after being a cop

247
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,284
for such a long time? Just enemies.

248
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,662
There you go!
That means you've done your job well.

249
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,623
lf a cop has no enemies, there is only one reason:

250
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,082
he hasn't caught any crooks.

251
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,627
l'm glad they hate you!

252
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,087
lt proves that you're a tough good cop.

253
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,631
Thanks for that.

254
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,218
But l've had enough.

255
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,677
l resigned today.

256
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:22,970
Really?

257
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:23,930
Are you disappointed?

258
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:24,889
You're really quitting?!

259
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,476
l'm so happy!

260
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:29,936
Calm down.

261
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,063
What's she doing?!

262
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,445
May, for these years,
l haven't treat you as good as l should.

263
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:40,696
lt's my fault.

264
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,114
l have three months' holidays.

265
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,743
- Let's go somewhere else to relax!
- Ka-kui, you mean it?

266
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,954
- where to go then? - Bali.

267
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,538
Good idea!

268
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,166
we haven't travel for years.

269
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,293
Right, so let's go.

270
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,588
lt feels good to fly on the plane.

271
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,887
- That's $5,540, please. - Right.

272
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,308
l'll see you outside.

273
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,727
- Credit card? - Sure.

274
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,819
Here's our catalogue, sir.

275
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,404
Thank you. Bye.

276
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,787
what clothes should l take?

277
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,622
You won't need any in Bali.

278
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,207
Don't be silly!

279
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,584
l can't believe we're going.

280
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,044
l just hope they won't rip us off.

281
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,879
No, they're a big company.

282
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,172
lt's trustworthy.

283
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,924
lt's paid for now.

284
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,509
Let's cross our fingers.

285
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,429
- Fey! - Ka-kui.

286
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,555
ls this your area?

287
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,514
- Yes. - What's up?

288
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,725
We've received a bomb threat in here.

289
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,143
Really?

290
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,228
Yeah. Can you help us out?

291
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,190
- All right, then. - Thanks.

292
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,736
- Ka-kui! - l'll just take a look, all right?

293
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,654
Sun.

294
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,406
Just in time. What's up?

295
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,325
We got a call about a bomb.

296
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,868
Are you sure it's real?

297
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,538
l don't think he was kidding.
He told us to clear the area.

298
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,415
we have ten minutes.

299
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,708
Really?

300
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,793
The manager said he's nuts.

301
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:21,088
Start clearing the building now.

302
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,257
There are too many people.

303
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,509
lf it's a hoax, who'll be to blame?

304
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,511
l'm used to getting an earful.

305
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,181
lf it is real, we'll endanger lives.

306
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,183
- That's true. - what do we do?

307
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,895
Consider it real. Clear the building.
Call headquarters.

308
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,188
where's the fire alarm?

309
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,274
- Over there. - Ka-kui.

310
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,194
We'll go set off the fire alarm. Come on.

311
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,534
- Your truncheon. - But. . .

312
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,119
Come on, l'll bear the consquence.

313
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,208
Follow me.

314
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,639
Don't panic. Don't worry.

315
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,017
Come back. l've opened the till already.

316
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,435
Have they paid?

317
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,605
what's going on?

318
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,403
lt's nothing.

319
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,988
what should we do? They're not taking any notice.

320
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,240
Ka-kui.

321
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,161
Don't stay here. Go on!

322
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,289
Your attention please, evacuate the building.

323
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,918
Everybody please leave immediately.

324
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,379
There's a fire in the building.

325
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,172
Please leave now.

326
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,759
Please leave in an orderly manner.

327
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,512
Everybody outside.

328
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:52,972
Be careful.

329
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,815
what's going on? why the alarm's on?

330
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,650
How about our business?

331
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,319
- Fay. - what's up?

332
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,030
Get them out of here.

333
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,243
This is for your own safety. Go now!

334
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,245
what about you?

335
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,830
l won't be long. You go first.

336
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,460
Check the building.

337
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:23,711
Yes, sir.

338
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,813
l can't understand this. lt's crazy!

339
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,319
Who's in charge?

340
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,528
You talk to them.

341
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:53,574
Please leave here now,
the police will take care of it.

342
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,618
Ka-kui. Ka-kui!

343
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,412
l'm all right. You go home first.

344
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:05,628
Hello, sir.

345
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:06,962
Who made the call?

346
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,631
We received a call

347
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,341
but we didn't know if it was a hoax.

348
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,676
Who set off the alarm?

349
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,471
lt was me, sir.

350
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,890
You may leave.

351
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,059
Yes, sir.

352
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,605
Why did you do it?

353
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,565
Sir, when l was in the Police Academy,

354
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:27,942
l was taught that

355
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,402
public safety comes first.

356
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,695
So l set off the alarm.

357
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,781
Do you think you're indispensable?

358
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,407
No, sir.

359
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:39,119
Superintendent. There's no fire.

360
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,872
But it was your men who cleared the building.

361
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,375
Right. The Bomb Disposal Unit are coming.

362
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,043
You won't be needed now.

363
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,920
Right. l hope this isn't a hoax.

364
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,838
- Uncle Bill. - So do l.

365
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,341
Raymond. They want to see the head man.

366
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,385
Shall l go?

367
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,513
- Where's the Bomb Disposal Unit?
- On their way.

368
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,309
what a mess.

369
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,727
Did l do the right thing?

370
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,896
How do l do know? Don't ask me.

371
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,232
Right now,

372
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,818
we have to wait and see.

373
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,319
Tell them to leave.

374
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,780
You can go back in very soon.

375
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,657
My ball!

376
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:41,181
When can we go back in?

377
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,391
Now what?

378
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:43,475
Very soon.

379
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,602
Here's your ball.

380
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,110
Ready?

381
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,820
The Bomb Disposal Unit are here.

382
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,489
lf they don't find anything,

383
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,617
the boss will blow a fuse.

384
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,410
Uncle Bill, l'm very sorry.

385
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,704
l'm not...

386
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,093
Red alert!

387
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,261
All units move in.

388
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,430
Go and fight the fire. Go on.

389
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,569
l suppose the good news is nobody got hurt.

390
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,904
what are the losses?

391
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,989
The insurance will cover it.

392
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,076
l'm more worried about the damage to our image.

393
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,453
l've asked the press to cooperate

394
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,954
and l'm sure they will.

395
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,874
But who did it and why our company?

396
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,626
lt may not be against us.

397
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,671
lt could be someone who's mentally disturbed.

398
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:57,841
There's a man on the line, sir.

399
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,551
He says he planted the bomb.

400
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:00,803
Have it put through.

401
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:05,349
- Put him through. - Hello? Hold on.

402
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,477
Listen, we planted the bomb
in your shopping centre.

403
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,313
we want $1 0 million. Pay up or your...

404
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,899
other properties will get bombed.

405
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,275
Let me talk to him.

406
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,611
All right.

407
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,405
But it's a huge amount of money.

408
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,532
We'll need to call a board meeting.

409
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,200
You've got 24 hours.

410
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,660
Don't call the police.

411
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:27,663
what to do then?

412
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,082
Must be some hoax.

413
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,417
Yes.

414
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,001
So what do we do?

415
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,169
Call the police.

416
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,337
We pay so much tax.

417
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,630
The police should do something for us.

418
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,717
- Call the head for me. - Yes.

419
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,177
Raymond, you were extremely lucky.

420
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:45,639
lt's amazing that no one
was hurt in the explosion.

421
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,349
Thank God for that.

422
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,602
And the Chu case, well done!

423
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,813
Thank you. But it wasn't just me.

424
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,231
That's right.

425
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,399
You've proved yourself.

426
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,944
You should handle this case. Do you agree?

427
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,029
- Sure. - Of course.

428
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:03,782
Bill.

429
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:04,867
Morning, sir.

430
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,368
This is a very tough case.

431
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,579
That's why they gave it to us.

432
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:11,999
ln our department, who do you think can solve it?

433
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,376
You're the only one.

434
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:15,627
l want a better idea.

435
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,921
And it's definitely not me.

436
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,842
Maybe we could bring back somebody who's on leave.

437
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,386
Do you mean somebody like Ka-kui?

438
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,804
He has good experience.

439
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:29,475
l don't know. He's unorthodox, impulsive.

440
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,268
He'll only give us trouble.
We have to bear the consquence

441
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:35,564
l agree he's a little bit rash,
but underneath he's a good cop.

442
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,899
l won't let him do it.

443
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,359
But if you think he's our man, you go find him.

444
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,952
Let's see who's the boss.

445
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,964
- Over there. - Here?

446
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,683
Fasten your seat belt please.

447
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,102
l forgot the sun screen. . .

448
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,604
Buy it when we get there.

449
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,358
Did you get your passport? When you were young?

450
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,820
Put out a call for Detective Chan Ka-kui.

451
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,154
Sure.

452
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,074
Attention please.

453
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,617
- will Chan Ka-kui... - Let me see.

454
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,118
No, don't look!

455
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,329
- lt's cute. - lt's horrible.

456
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,081
Ka-kui. . .

457
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,290
- That's you. - Yeah.

458
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:36,375
What's up?

459
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,501
l don't know.

460
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,919
l won't be long.

461
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,006
- Are you Mr Chan? - Yeah.

462
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,342
l'm afraid there seems to be

463
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,010
a problem with your passport.

464
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,220
Really?

465
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:49,638
lt'll just be a quick check.

466
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:55,811
- what's going on? - l'll be back right away.

467
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,146
- Hurry! - OK

468
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:00,899
Bye-bye.

469
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,788
What do you want?

470
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:16,957
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

471
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,750
what is it? l have a plane waiting.

472
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,460
We have a problem.

473
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:24,464
lt seems that the bombing case
has become a blackmail case.

474
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,049
And it's a very tough one.

475
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,134
So?

476
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,052
This case is a real challenge.

477
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,512
Raymond was hoping...

478
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,182
l was hoping that you might cancel your holiday.

479
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,977
No! l've already boarded the plane.

480
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,395
And l've quit.

481
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,022
l know how you feel.

482
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,190
You've been under pressure lately.

483
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,609
But ducking out like this?

484
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,110
l'm not ducking out.

485
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,112
He said he's not ducking out!

486
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:52,993
Raymond is a great admirer of your abilities.

487
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:57,039
l don't have any abilities. l'm too impulsive.

488
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,791
lmpulsive? More a man of action.

489
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,252
lf only l could control my actions.

490
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:05,255
A true man of action
is one who acts upon instinct.

491
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,883
l think the police force

492
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,217
needs men with discipline.

493
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,511
lnstinctive men have to be unconventional,

494
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,847
even at the cost of discipline.

495
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,893
lf you did everything by the book,
no cases would be solved. Am l right?

496
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,436
Absolutely.

497
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,230
l'd better get back on board.

498
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,400
You're right.

499
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,486
Goodbye.

500
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,283
How much is the ransom?

501
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,702
Ten million. That's all we know.

502
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:36,912
Do we have any suspects?

503
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,413
Not a clue.

504
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,166
Do you think these people are insane?

505
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,669
why are you asking me? l don't know.

506
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,588
Have you traced the dynamite?

507
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,340
why?

508
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,591
Yes. why?

509
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:50,592
Simple.

510
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,886
Dynamite is a controlled substance.

511
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,764
So you either smuggle it in

512
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,516
or steal it from a local company.

513
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,352
He's right. we'd not thought of that.

514
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:01,853
we must find their bomb factory

515
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,564
before the company pays the ransom.

516
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,858
lf we do that, we can foil their plans.

517
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,903
Why can you always solve problems so easily?

518
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,488
You're the one who's made for this case.

519
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:12,823
- You're in charge. - Just follow you

520
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,116
Yes, sir.

521
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,202
l've got a plane to catch.

522
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:21,206
wait! Ka-kui.

523
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,541
You can go there any time.

524
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,292
This case is a one-off.

525
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,128
- l... - Go there next time. OK?

526
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,339
l'd better talk to May first.

527
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,674
Hurry up, then.

528
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,471
Hurry up.

529
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,641
- Miss! - Yes, sir?

530
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,393
- My plane... - lt just took off.

531
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,480
lt's taken off!

532
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,233
You've missed your flight!

533
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,402
Trust them to be on schedule.

534
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,280
l still have May's passport.

535
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,700
Damn! lt sure isn't your lucky day!

536
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,078
Now what?

537
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,465
Uncle Bill, we better go.

538
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,052
All right?

539
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,011
l ate something bad.

540
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,306
- That way, sir. - Thank you.

541
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:23,977
Excuse me. We're police officers.
We're here to see Miss Wong.

542
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,979
- 30th floor. - Thank you.

543
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:29,691
Bugging devices.

544
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,693
Bugging?

545
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,111
Be careful, Nixon lost his job
because of one of these.

546
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,613
lf we are to solve the case,

547
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,908
we have to know our targets well.
We're counting on you.

548
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:39,868
Put them away.

549
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:45,707
- Miss Wong, there are two police officers here.
- Where's the loo?

550
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,001
- On your right. - Thanks.

551
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:51,922
25 please.

552
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:54,758
24 please.

553
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,969
Wait!

554
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,432
Uncle Bill, l'm really worried about May.

555
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:05,811
l'll call Jakarta airport
as soon as l get to the office.

556
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:15,946
Uncle Bill.

557
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,586
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Haven't you got any manners?

558
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,552
Let's use the other elevators.

559
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,692
Detective Chan to see Miss Wong.
lf you'll please wait.

560
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,235
- Please wait - Thank you.

561
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,741
- Ka-Kui - Uncle Bill

562
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,746
l thought you were used to taking the blame.

563
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,206
That's no excuse!

564
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,291
Gentlemen.

565
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,877
l'm Detective Chang, this is Detective Chan.

566
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,044
we...

567
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,337
Please come with me.

568
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,673
- we're... - l know. Mr Fung is busy now

569
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:19,134
but he's signed the papers.

570
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,933
Excuse me.

571
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,773
Excuse me, where's the toilet?

572
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:34,983
Down the corridor.

573
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,985
Here, sir.

574
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:38,486
l'm so sorry.

575
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,825
lt's OK. Where's your friend?

576
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,410
He had a sudden urge.

577
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,052
There's the chairman.

578
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,554
That site is worth three billion.
There would be a profit.

579
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,014
- Chairman, - Yes?

580
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,849
- Detective Chan is here. - Thank you.

581
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,267
Thanks for all your help.

582
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,815
You're developing the new estates very fast.

583
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,495
Please sit.

584
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:34,834
welcome to all directors, managers and heads.

585
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,462
l've called this meeting to review the performance

586
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:40,215
of our property portfolio

587
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,218
and to set the sales target for the next year.

588
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,387
You may all know that

589
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,472
since the collapse of

590
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,599
the stock market last year,

591
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:53,311
the Hang Seng lndex has risen 66% .

592
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,730
Let me show you the performance

593
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,774
of the major blue chip shares.

594
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:23,216
However, by the performance of the bank
and property sectors,

595
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,844
the outlook of the stock market for

596
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,763
the next half year remains uncertain.

597
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,724
ln situations like this,

598
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:35,812
small investors are likely
to put their money in property.

599
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,244
So we have to accelerate the pace of

600
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,330
developing our new housing estates.

601
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,627
Hi, you're gorgeous.

602
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,265
lf someone asks the chairman

603
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,892
for this, it's $500 to get it back.

604
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,728
- Really? - Yeah. Bye-bye.

605
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,564
- What happened? - lt's a meeting.

606
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:20,857
Did you plant the bugs?

607
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,692
- Sure. - And the desk?

608
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,736
- All done. - was it easy?

609
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:25,945
He wasn't against it!

610
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,284
- What was said? - Something about houses.

611
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,619
Really?

612
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,120
- Where are you going?
- l'll take the next one.

613
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,312
May's here.

614
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,569
May, you're back!

615
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,238
May.

616
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:09,781
You scumbag!

617
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,658
Let me explain.

618
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,245
You... You didn't want me to come back!

619
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,622
You left me there

620
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,040
and took my passport!

621
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:22,043
when l got there, l couldn't do anything.

622
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,878
Before l was sent back here,

623
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,965
they detained me for ten hours in a cell!

624
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,676
Why should l keep my voice down?

625
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,345
When you take your dog for a walk,

626
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,848
do you not take him home afterwards?

627
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,266
l'm even worse than a dog.

628
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,309
May, they're watching us.

629
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,979
what are you staring at?

630
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,440
lt's none of your business!

631
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,109
l want you to tell me in front of everyone

632
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,861
what you think l am.

633
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,571
what the hell do you take me for?

634
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,531
You're my girlfriend!

635
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:55,326
Your girlfriend?! Open up! Open up!

636
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,125
lf that's true, why treat me that way?

637
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:05,003
You even treat strangers better than me.

638
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,713
Let me tell you...

639
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,884
it's over between us!

640
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,733
Chan Ka-kui, you bastard!

641
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:31,613
Uncle Bill, did you make that call?

642
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,781
l needed to go to the toilet.

643
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,158
You've ruined my life.

644
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,547
Wait!

645
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,758
Go away or l'll run you over.

646
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,511
- Go away! - Don't be childish!

647
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,599
Don't grab my bag! Go away!

648
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,185
Don't even touch me. Go away. Leave me alone.

649
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:03,895
Let me explain.

650
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:05,730
l don't want to know.

651
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:07,899
l've nothing else to say to you.

652
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,192
- l don't want to see you. - May!

653
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,531
May, are you all right?

654
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,409
Stay away from me. Don't touch my motorbike.

655
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,203
Keep away. l don't want you anywhere near me.

656
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:22,080
- Let me explain. - Keep away.

657
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,043
Why won't you help me?!

658
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:33,091
Just keep away from me.
l don't want to see you again.

659
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,510
May.

660
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:38,263
All right, get back to work. l want to see Ka-kui.

661
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,431
Ka-kui, the boss wants to see you.

662
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,358
Sorry, sir.

663
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,196
l'm sorry, sir.

664
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:56,447
lt's all right.

665
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,449
Do you want to call May to explain?

666
00:42:58,701 --> 00:42:59,742
l don't think it would help.

667
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,453
Don't explain to women!
This is my way to treat my woman.

668
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:03,705
lf a man's not at home,

669
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,790
it's obvious he's working.

670
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,251
Excuse me, l have to go to the toilet.

671
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,712
Don't take any notice of his chauvinism.

672
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,005
Go get changed.

673
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:13,923
Sorry. sir

674
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:43,995
Are you going home, May?

675
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,999
lt's better than wasting my time here. Good night.

676
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,376
Can l walk you home?

677
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,253
No thanks.

678
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,344
Don't be foolish.

679
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:00,928
No, l won't.

680
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,014
Get me, it's me you want.

681
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,349
Don't be foolish.

682
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,476
You're in this together.

683
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:07,685
Don't try anything.

684
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:10,897
Prepare to die!

685
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:18,571
l really had you going! l got the both of you!

686
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,116
Ka-kui!

687
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:35,129
l've found it.

688
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,894
Looks like you're outnumbered.

689
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:51,270
lf l knew it's merely an easy game

690
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,898
l won't call my men to come.

691
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:55,650
l'm flattered.

692
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,945
My boss asked me to teach you a lesson.

693
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,072
l'm paid to do it.

694
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:02,448
But l don't need to dirty my hands,

695
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,118
my men can take care of you.

696
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:06,703
Get on with it.

697
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,955
We'll give you a chance.

698
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,374
lf you apologise to Mr Ko now,

699
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,292
we won't break both of your legs.

700
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,211
we'll just break one of them.

701
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:18,047
Cut the bullshit. Go on, kill me.

702
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,341
Kill a cop? No, l don't think so.

703
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:21,884
My boss wants to teach you a lesson.

704
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:25,346
Ripping a few limbs off should do the trick.

705
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,063
Get him!

706
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,024
Go!

707
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,872
There he is. Beat him up!

708
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:57,104
Go on, finish him off. Get up.

709
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,709
Move over. Let me drive.

710
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,930
l'll turn you into mashed banana.

711
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:30,656
lt wasn't my fault! l was paid to do it.

712
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,641
Keep away or l'll shoot!

713
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:57,975
Shoot me!

714
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:58,476
l'll shoot.

715
00:48:58,477 --> 00:48:59,435
Shoot here!

716
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:00,478
lt's not my fault.

717
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:11,072
lt's not. lt's not my fault.

718
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,490
Next time l'll kick your ass.

719
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:15,034
lt's not my fault.

720
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:24,335
May.

721
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:26,253
May. Did they hurt you?

722
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:27,797
l'm all right.

723
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,925
You'd better be careful.

724
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:35,596
why did you chase him? lt's dangerous.

725
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,932
l wanted to make things up to you.

726
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,769
lf it had been acid in that pistol and not ink,

727
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,480
l'd have been scarred.

728
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:47,566
Maybe they wanted to distract you
and then kidnap me.

729
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,069
Then what would happen?

730
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:55,616
Ka-kui, l want my boyfriend to be gentle,

731
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,745
not a savage. Do you understand?

732
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,132
Come in.

733
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:15,636
Good morning.

734
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,391
Police detective in park rumpus. Who was that?

735
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:21,851
Look!

736
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:25,938
l'll check out the surveillance team.

737
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:38,576
lt was me.

738
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,119
Sorry, sir.

739
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,832
l know Chu wants revenge,

740
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,834
but don't take the law into your own hands.

741
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:48,044
Sorry, sir.

742
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,920
Anything l can do?

743
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,381
No, thanks. l can cope with it.

744
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:54,717
l just want them to leave me alone.

745
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,553
All right. But keep your eyes open.

746
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,556
Now we've got a surveillance team.

747
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,684
They're very good. Go and talk to them.

748
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,314
Thank you, sir.

749
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,278
Did he give you an earful? Did he. . .

750
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,322
Let's go over there.

751
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:20,618
He just want to help.

752
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,995
How to show off if there is no audience?

753
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:39,762
Sir,

754
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:41,639
let me introduce.

755
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,807
This is Detective Chan Ka-kui;

756
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,517
Detective Ng, Detective Mui.

757
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:46,560
Hello.

758
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:47,561
You guys intoduce yourselves.

759
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,188
- Sum - Kin

760
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,607
They are the special tactic unit.

761
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:52,817
Please take a seat.

762
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,944
They are expertised in following targets.

763
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:58,531
But why? will this be useful for the case?

764
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,367
Because we don't even know who did it.

765
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:02,618
That's easy.

766
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:05,246
Follow anyone suspicious then you'll know.

767
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,497
Follow the suspects

768
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:09,125
then we could find the their hiding place
for making bombs.

769
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:11,168
Just to follow them during the transaction,

770
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:12,837
then we could arrest them.

771
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,046
That simple?

772
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,297
Of course.

773
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,424
Good, that's why l always have faith on you.

774
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:18,884
Hope you have a smooth cooperation.

775
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,345
Detective Ng, could l have a word with you?

776
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:24,181
There will be room for you soon.

777
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:25,349
Go.

778
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,101
- Bye. - Bye.

779
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,105
- Detective Chan. - Yes.

780
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,190
what does that mean?

781
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,611
Because you are cool.

782
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,746
Anything yet?

783
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:51,250
Fung said his shares would go up.

784
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:52,960
That's hardly relevant.

785
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:55,921
And his girlfriend is a top model!

786
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,715
l'm not interested.

787
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:00,801
l'll take it. You go call May.

788
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:03,721
Go on.

789
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:12,605
Ka-kui! Listen.

790
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,484
Your conditions have been presented

791
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:19,486
to the board and they will pay.

792
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,530
No shit. Do you have the money?

793
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,073
We don't have it all.

794
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,743
$1 0 million is a lot of money.

795
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:27,161
Trace it.

796
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,378
- lt's from Tai Po. - Check it out.

797
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,067
He's in Ting Kok Road.

798
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,361
HQ calling all foot patrols.

799
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:06,200
Are there any units in Ting Kok Road, over?

800
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:09,286
This is PC 1 2674 on Ting Kok Road, over.

801
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:11,413
PC 1 2674,

802
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,916
check anybody leaving a phone box in the area.

803
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,167
Roger.

804
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,545
Are you stalling for time?

805
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,798
No, we didn't call the police.

806
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:22,591
Now we want 20 million.

807
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:26,011
20 million! lt's impossible.

808
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:27,513
Find it.

809
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,056
Wait!

810
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:39,275
This is PC 1 2674.

811
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:40,526
Anything?

812
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:41,902
l think l've got a suspect.

813
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:43,988
Be careful. He's very dangerous.

814
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:45,864
He could be armed.

815
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,491
Keep everything low key.

816
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,034
Roger.

817
00:54:57,002 --> 00:55:00,671
Excuse me, you're supposed to use
the pedestrian crossing.

818
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,090
Go on.

819
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,009
Give me a chance, Officer.

820
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,427
Can l see your lD card?

821
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:19,857
Calling HQ...

822
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:33,912
PC 1 2674, can you hear...

823
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,879
An officer needs assistance in Ting Kok Road.

824
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,259
l'm sorry, he isn't here.

825
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:48,761
Don't be sorry.

826
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:52,222
lt's the way things go. lt wasn't your fault.

827
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:54,767
How long have you been in uniform?

828
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,518
About two months.

829
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,146
Then you're excused.

830
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:02,149
will l get in trouble for losing my gun?

831
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,359
what about promotions?!

832
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,320
Don't worry. As long as you learn

833
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:08,947
from the experience, it's OK.

834
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,324
lt happens to every cop.

835
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:11,575
lt won't happen again.

836
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:12,785
Do you think you'd recognise him?

837
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,119
Sure.

838
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:15,454
Phone.

839
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:17,456
l could do with someone like you on the team.

840
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:18,874
l'll see to it.

841
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:22,961
Thank you. Can you file this for me?

842
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,256
- Hello. - lt's Joker.

843
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:27,758
- Go ahead. - News.

844
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:29,009
What news?

845
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,886
A guy called Crazy Fai sells dynamite.

846
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,721
Nine o'clock, Hoi Wong Bar.

847
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,864
- Do you know what we'll do next? - No.

848
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:52,449
Really?

849
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:58,831
What do you want?

850
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,582
Are you Fai? l want to talk.

851
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,292
Do l know you?

852
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,086
No. But you will.

853
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,506
All right. Let's go over there.

854
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:09,883
l'll be right back.

855
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,849
- What's your name? - Lo.

856
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,142
What do you want?

857
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:19,852
Some explosives.

858
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:21,562
Explosives?

859
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:22,771
Do you have some?

860
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:24,565
- What are they for? - Fishing.

861
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,193
You don't look like a fisherman.

862
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,446
what if l told you it was for business?

863
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:31,905
l'll give you a good price.

864
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:34,074
what do you say?

865
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,787
All right, l need to speak to someone.

866
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,706
lt's not my stuff. Don't go away.

867
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,124
Thanks.

868
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,814
Sorry, he's out of stock

869
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:08,275
but he'll call me back.

870
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:09,776
Stay here, l'll be back. . .

871
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,487
- when l've finished. - Thank you.

872
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:59,159
Hey, you. Stand up.

873
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:01,620
what's the matter?

874
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:03,747
ClD. On your feet.

875
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:16,593
Hands up.

876
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:17,719
l only came for a drink.

877
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:18,595
A drink?

878
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:20,430
we heard you were dealing contraband.

879
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,434
Eyes front.

880
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:36,780
Hold it. Throw me your gun. Quick!

881
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,369
Stand over there.

882
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,997
Easy. Don't do anything stupid.

883
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:59,177
Come on. Move.

884
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:00,804
Come out here!

885
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:05,118
Get lost.

886
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:09,581
You screwed me over. You bastard!
why did you call the cops?

887
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,504
Stop! Stop it!

888
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:22,469
Please, that's enough. Please stop.

889
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,638
Why did you do it?

890
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,348
To make sure you weren't a cop.

891
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:28,475
That's why l called the cops to prove it.

892
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,310
l can get what you need.

893
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:31,687
where is it?

894
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:33,146
Have you got the money?

895
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,903
lt's cash on delivery.

896
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:44,825
Keep a look out.

897
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:01,049
ls it good stuff?

898
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:03,301
lt's from the quarries.

899
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,553
Got any more?

900
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:06,179
Yeah, plenty.

901
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:16,022
There's enough to blow up
the Empire State Building.

902
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:19,025
l just met him!

903
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:20,610
l've never seen him before!

904
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,782
Do you think you can get away?

905
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,077
Would you like a coffee?

906
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:30,871
A cigarette?

907
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:38,670
Two spoons of sugar?

908
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:39,921
Yes.

909
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,716
The temperature ok?

910
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,138
Ok.

911
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:50,849
This will offend the law. l won't do it.

912
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:53,101
You seem comfortable.

913
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:55,103
Then should you cooperate with us now?

914
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:56,938
Cooperation?

915
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:58,815
You want me die?

916
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:00,400
lf you cooperate, you will walk out of here.

917
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:01,818
We will keep everything secret.

918
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:04,029
lf needed, we will keep you under protection.

919
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:08,033
lf you three could protect me for my whole life,

920
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:09,534
then l would consider it.

921
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:14,039
Don't talk that way.

922
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,707
Even if we release you now,

923
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,083
after you get out of here,

924
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:20,504
we will find drugs on you. Well. . .

925
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:23,089
we could also find you guilty
for raping young girl.

926
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:26,968
Have you had good results this way?

927
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,429
Sure. lt never fails.

928
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,310
What's the charge?

929
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:38,647
l've seen a lot worse than this

930
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:40,607
before going to jail, l'll play along.

931
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:57,374
You all seem like nice young ladies...

932
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:04,005
Have you not seen anything like this before?

933
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:13,473
No! Stop! l've had enough.

934
01:04:14,475 --> 01:04:15,475
No, please!

935
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:17,143
Nice young ladies, huh?

936
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,026
Aren't you going to play along?

937
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:26,736
l'll sue you!

938
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:31,032
Say that again. Guns have a habit of going off
when you least expect it.

939
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:32,659
We'll just say it was an accident.

940
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:34,536
Yeah. Escaped prisoner!

941
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:38,248
Good. Get my gun!

942
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:40,458
No! l'll talk.

943
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:42,127

01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,217

One buyer was a fisherman.

951
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:02,981
l've known him for long.

952
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:04,733
After buying, he sold it to someone
who used to blast reef fish.

953
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:06,776
The other one buys my stuff

954
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:08,778
to refill empty bullet shell cases

955
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:10,655
and then he sells them as bullets.

956
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:11,990
Yet he had only sold a few.

957
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:13,700
The third guy's name was Polar Bear.

01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:16,369
He's a big-time dealer.

959
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:18,914

Of course.

01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:02,173
Then, l have to make a call.

1005
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:14,727

Let's go.

We now start the car.

01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:55,286

Police! who are you?

1038
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:51,837
The guy must be deaf and dumb.

1039
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:57,843
Did you see three men
come through here a few hours ago?

1040
01:16:04,184 --> 01:16:05,643
You ask him.

1041
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:12,900
Do you work here?

1042
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:19,240
Do you sleep here?

1043
01:16:24,621 --> 01:16:26,664
Right. l got an answer

1044
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:29,750
but l have no idea what it means.

1045
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:31,002
You ask him.

1046
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:32,628
Take him to the station.

1047
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:37,258
lt's OK. You're coming with me,
just for questions.

1048
01:16:37,509 --> 01:16:38,884
Come, it won't cost anything.

1049
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:40,469
No need to lock.

1050
01:16:42,055 --> 01:16:46,767
You don't need those.

1051
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:49,228
He's deaf.

1052
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:53,649
Are all these toys in here yours?

1053
01:17:29,394 --> 01:17:30,144
Stop!

1054
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:31,145
He can't hear you.

1055
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:43,366
Help me find my gun.

1056
01:17:58,632 --> 01:18:01,759
Sir! Are you all right?

1057
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:04,720
There's a deaf-mute running around, find him.

1058
01:18:04,971 --> 01:18:06,305
Right!

1059
01:18:07,474 --> 01:18:08,766
l didn't know he could fight.

1060
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:10,810
Neither did l. Go and find my gun.

1061
01:18:11,061 --> 01:18:12,269
Ok.

1062
01:18:14,856 --> 01:18:17,108

Mr Fung, telephone.

1068
01:18:29,996 --> 01:18:31,497
Jimmy.

1069
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:33,999
Excuse me.

1070
01:18:47,264 --> 01:18:48,681
You called the cops.

1071
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:51,016
No, you must be mistaken. We haven't...

1072
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:54,603
Cut the crap. We knew you'd go to the cops.

01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:56,480
But we won't change our minds at all.

After 1 2p.m. tomorrow,

1079
01:19:07,659 --> 01:19:10,578

1080
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:14,039

1081
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:16,083
Give a call to Officer Lam

1082
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:17,460
After 1 2p.m. tomorrow,

1083
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:19,962
if you still agree to pay the $20 million,

1084
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:23,257

Again.

1087
01:19:28,054 --> 01:19:29,221
Where was the call from?

1088
01:19:29,222 --> 01:19:30,848
lt was a modified mobile

1089
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:32,099
so we couldn't trace it.

1090
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:33,893
we knew you'd go the cops.

1091
01:19:34,144 --> 01:19:35,561
But it doesn't change things.

1092
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:37,021
We'll show what we can do

1093
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:39,482
with our explosives at 1 2 tomorrow.

1094
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:40,733
We won't waste time

1095
01:19:40,984 --> 01:19:43,110
bargaining with you again.

1096
01:19:43,361 --> 01:19:44,862
Don't worry, they're bluffing.

1097
01:19:45,238 --> 01:19:46,238
we've sent extra officers

1098
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:48,199
to protect your buildings.

1099
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:50,326
You'll be fine.

1100
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,287
Listen,

1101
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:55,748
this blackmail has gone on long enough.
lt's time to act.

1102
01:19:55,999 --> 01:19:56,999
Yes, sir.

1103
01:20:00,670 --> 01:20:01,837
Fey,

1104
01:20:02,422 --> 01:20:03,422
long time no see.

1105
01:20:05,258 --> 01:20:06,258
Polar Bear.

1106
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:08,719
This is Ken.

1107
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:12,264
l didn't grass you up!

1108
01:20:12,516 --> 01:20:13,474
Really?

1109
01:20:13,725 --> 01:20:15,684
why did they turn up after you got caught?

1110
01:20:15,936 --> 01:20:17,937
why did they let you go so easily?

1111
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:20,481
Because they couldn't keep me with no evidence.

1112
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:23,108
l didn't grass you up, l swear!

1113
01:20:23,944 --> 01:20:25,444
lt makes no difference,

1114
01:20:26,029 --> 01:20:27,780
we've made other arrangements.

1115
01:20:28,365 --> 01:20:29,532
Where are we going?!

1116
01:20:29,533 --> 01:20:30,533
You'll find out.

1117
01:20:30,867 --> 01:20:32,409
- Miss wong. - what is it?

1118
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:33,828
We've checked the mail.

1119
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:35,329
Thanks.

1120
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:36,831
And these are for you.

1121
01:20:37,582 --> 01:20:38,707
Who sent that?

1122
01:20:38,708 --> 01:20:40,084
Don't know. Someone special?

1123
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:42,044
lf you don't know, who would?

1124
01:20:42,295 --> 01:20:43,254
Thanks.

1125
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:50,553
Plant this bomb

1126
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:52,179
and we're even.

1127
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:55,599
Do the job or you're finished.

1128
01:20:56,476 --> 01:20:57,643
Where shall l put it?

1129
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:58,644
l'll tell you later.

1130
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:00,145
Let's go.

1131
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:07,361
Roger. Thanks a lot.

1132
01:21:11,616 --> 01:21:12,741
Ready.

1134
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:20,875

1135
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:36,765

Nothing.

ClD. Your case.

1139
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:56,285
Well?

1140
01:22:03,543 --> 01:22:04,543
Nothing.

1141
01:22:04,794 --> 01:22:05,920
Ok.

1142
01:22:06,671 --> 01:22:07,796
What's that?

1143
01:22:10,133 --> 01:22:11,133

1144
01:22:12,052 --> 01:22:13,969
Excuse me, ClD. May l see your bag?

1145
01:22:23,688 --> 01:22:24,855
The red bag.

1146
01:22:24,856 --> 01:22:26,273
Excuse me, ClD.

1147
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:40,704
Make it quick.

1148
01:22:45,418 --> 01:22:46,543
lt should be fine.

1149
01:22:46,544 --> 01:22:48,379
Here's the mail, sir.

1150
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:51,548
Roger.

1151
01:22:53,009 --> 01:22:54,259
Do you think it's a bluff?

1152
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:57,471
l hope so, but we can't be sure.

1153
01:22:58,932 --> 01:23:00,516
Talk to you later. Yes?

1154
01:23:02,727 --> 01:23:07,022
Tell her he's coming.

1155
01:23:07,941 --> 01:23:09,066
Roger.

1156
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,027
Ka-kui, May's downstairs.

1157
01:23:12,278 --> 01:23:13,779
She wants to talk to you urgently.

1158
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:16,865
Thanks.

1159
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:22,329
May. what's the matter?

1160
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:26,834
l've written a letter for you. Bye.

1161
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:31,755
May. You came all this way to give me this?

1162
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:34,550
lt's important so keep it safe. Bye.

1163
01:23:36,636 --> 01:23:38,512
Oh, yeah, where's the scooter?

1164
01:23:38,888 --> 01:23:41,682
we didn't get along so l sold it.

1165
01:23:47,939 --> 01:23:49,064
l'll follow her.

1166
01:24:00,952 --> 01:24:03,120
l have my backup units in position.

1167
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:06,665
Yes. l think they're bluffing.

1168
01:24:06,916 --> 01:24:07,958
Then we should depend on the police.

1169
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:09,251
All right.

1170
01:24:11,004 --> 01:24:12,296
what is going on?

1171
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:16,925
Get an ambulance.

1172
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:18,343
Get the fire extinguisher.

1173
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:20,137
Call Mr. Lam.

1174
01:24:35,653 --> 01:24:37,237
Why this happened?

1175
01:24:44,704 --> 01:24:45,871
Go investigate.

1176
01:24:45,872 --> 01:24:46,872
Stay calm.

1177
01:24:46,873 --> 01:24:47,748
Don't panic.

1178
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:48,832
Ka-kui, come with me.

1179
01:24:48,833 --> 01:24:49,500
Call the fire department. Come on!

1180
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:50,667
Yes, sir.

1181
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:56,673
Bring a fire extinguisher.

1182
01:25:00,553 --> 01:25:01,845
Come on. Put the fire out first.

1183
01:25:02,388 --> 01:25:03,430
Come on, get moving.

1184
01:25:03,681 --> 01:25:04,765
- Ambulance here? - No.

1185
01:25:05,016 --> 01:25:06,558
Go make calls.

1186
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:12,272
we need more help.

1187
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:13,398
Phone, sir.

1188
01:25:13,399 --> 01:25:14,608
Bill, you take the phone call.

1189
01:25:14,859 --> 01:25:16,902
Ka-kui, meet me upstairs.

1190
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:25,702
l thought you were supposed to protect me.

1191
01:25:32,335 --> 01:25:33,418
What's up?

1192
01:25:33,419 --> 01:25:35,170
Parcel bomb. Miss Wong lost an arm.

1193
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:51,436
How's Miss wong?

1194
01:25:51,688 --> 01:25:52,855
She's doing well.

1195
01:25:52,856 --> 01:25:56,316
The doctor said her arm would recover.

1196
01:25:57,026 --> 01:25:59,278
They'll do a skin graft on her face later.

1197
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:01,613
So we'll wait and see.

1198
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:05,909
Wong's decided to pay up.

1199
01:26:06,786 --> 01:26:08,370
what am l going to tell Raymond?

1200
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:12,583
Uncle Bill, that's the way it goes.

1201
01:26:13,042 --> 01:26:14,251
we said it'd be a tough case.

1202
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:17,045
we're dealing with an organised bunch
of criminals here.

1203
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:19,506
l wish they'd blown me up instead.

1204
01:26:19,757 --> 01:26:21,341
l don't like putting lives at risk.

1205
01:26:21,885 --> 01:26:23,719
Don't worry.

1206
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:25,846
lf they come and collect the money,
l'm sure we'll get them.

1207
01:26:26,097 --> 01:26:27,681
lf l pass on what you said to Raymond,

1208
01:26:27,932 --> 01:26:29,850
he'll not be happy at all.

1209
01:26:30,393 --> 01:26:32,019
what we need is real action.

1210
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:35,063
Sir

1211
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:38,317
l guess you've seen the papers.

1212
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:40,777
Now what do l tell the chief?

1213
01:26:47,911 --> 01:26:50,746
That's the way it goes.

1214
01:26:50,997 --> 01:26:52,080
we said it'd be a tough case.

1215
01:26:52,332 --> 01:26:53,707
we're dealing with

1216
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:56,043
an organised bunch of criminals here.

1217
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:58,921
l wish they'd blown me up instead.

1218
01:26:59,172 --> 01:27:01,423
l don't like putting lives at risk.

1219
01:27:01,925 --> 01:27:04,760
Don't worry.

1220
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:07,721
lf they come and collect the money,
l'm sure we'll get them.

1221
01:27:07,972 --> 01:27:08,931
All this is talk,

1222
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:10,682
what we need is some real action.

1223
01:27:22,403 --> 01:27:24,821
Something's up. Raymond's in trouble.

1224
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:29,785
That's the way it goes.

1225
01:27:30,036 --> 01:27:31,954
we said it'd be a tough case.

1226
01:27:32,497 --> 01:27:34,164
we're dealing with

1227
01:27:34,415 --> 01:27:35,874
an organised bunch of criminals here.

1228
01:27:37,835 --> 01:27:40,879
l wish they'd blown me up instead.

1229
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:42,547
l don't like putting lives at risk.

1230
01:27:43,049 --> 01:27:44,091
Don't worry.

1231
01:27:44,425 --> 01:27:46,885
lf they come and collect l'm sure we'll get them.

1232
01:27:47,303 --> 01:27:48,887
l understand your situation

1233
01:27:49,138 --> 01:27:50,764
and l'll note it in the report.

1234
01:27:51,015 --> 01:27:54,017
Good luck with the case.

1235
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:03,902
You come, too.

1236
01:28:07,156 --> 01:28:08,532
why the long face?

1237
01:28:08,783 --> 01:28:10,242
Did you two have a fight?

1238
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:12,828
Right! But it's the last one.

1239
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:28,468
Yes? l'll get him.

1240
01:28:28,469 --> 01:28:29,678
Hold this.

1241
01:28:31,055 --> 01:28:32,723
Ka-kui, phone.

1242
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:33,974
Put it through.

1243
01:28:35,059 --> 01:28:36,601
Right. Put it through.

1244
01:28:38,521 --> 01:28:39,479
- Hello. Ka-kui. - Yes.

1245
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:41,398
May's been kidnapped!

1246
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:42,733
when?

1247
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:43,775
we'd just left the shop

1248
01:28:44,027 --> 01:28:45,819
and someone lifted her into a van.

1249
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:47,237
who did it?

1250
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:50,741
l don't know.
But it must be something to do with you.

1251
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:52,868
Could it be those thugs again?

1252
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:54,745
- Yes, sir. - Chu Tu.

1253
01:28:56,039 --> 01:28:58,415
Ka-kui... Hello?

1254
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:02,252
Ka-kui! what's up?

1255
01:29:02,503 --> 01:29:04,421
An old score.

1256
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:05,839
Ka-kui!

1257
01:29:07,133 --> 01:29:08,258
- What happened? - May is caught.

1258
01:29:08,968 --> 01:29:11,595
what's the matter?
Sign this cheque before you're dead.

1259
01:29:11,846 --> 01:29:12,721
Our brothers...

1260
01:29:12,722 --> 01:29:14,222
- Please stop. He's a patient.
- Let me finish.

1261
01:29:14,474 --> 01:29:16,892
we did what you asked.
That's why we deserve something.

1262
01:29:17,143 --> 01:29:18,769
You won't need any money when you're dead.

1263
01:29:33,201 --> 01:29:34,368
Chu Tu!

1264
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:38,538
Chu Tu! Hey, you!

1265
01:30:15,701 --> 01:30:16,952
Chu Tu! Chu Tu!

1266
01:30:21,207 --> 01:30:22,332
where is May?

1267
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:23,750
l don't know.

1268
01:30:23,751 --> 01:30:25,168
l didn't do anything. lt's him.

1269
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:29,005
where the hell's May?

1270
01:30:30,174 --> 01:30:31,758
Stop it! He's sick.

1271
01:30:32,009 --> 01:30:33,135
Put him down.

1272
01:30:33,553 --> 01:30:35,053
Where did you take her?

1273
01:30:35,304 --> 01:30:36,346
l didn't take her.

1274
01:30:36,597 --> 01:30:37,556
Who did then?

1275
01:30:37,807 --> 01:30:38,932
l was very nasty to you before.

1276
01:30:39,183 --> 01:30:40,934
But now l'm sick and penniless.

1277
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:43,437
why would l take her?

1278
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:45,272
He's got no money now.

1279
01:30:45,523 --> 01:30:47,149
lt has nothing to do with us.

1280
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,109
He made your life miserable.

1281
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,986
we did it because of money.

1282
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:53,363
Then who could it be?

1283
01:30:56,492 --> 01:30:57,951
There's a phone over there.

1284
01:30:58,703 --> 01:31:00,120
Don't die before you sign this!
Sign this cheque before you're dead.

1285
01:31:00,371 --> 01:31:02,330
You...

1286
01:31:02,582 --> 01:31:04,541
He's nearly dead, so l won't care.

1287
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:06,668
lf not, maybe l will.

1288
01:31:19,348 --> 01:31:20,432
Hello?

1289
01:31:20,683 --> 01:31:21,850
Ka-kui!

1290
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:23,059
May!

1291
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:24,769
You recognise her voice.

1292
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:26,980
We're at the Hung Fung lndustrial Building.

1293
01:31:27,398 --> 01:31:28,982
Who is this? What do you want?

1294
01:31:29,233 --> 01:31:31,776
Come alone or she's dead.

1295
01:31:32,069 --> 01:31:35,447
Wait!

1296
01:31:36,699 --> 01:31:37,741
l know where it is.

1297
01:32:13,986 --> 01:32:17,614
May! Are you all right?

1298
01:32:20,993 --> 01:32:22,035
Be quiet.

1299
01:32:22,578 --> 01:32:23,620
Are you all right?

1300
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:24,704
l'm OK.

1301
01:32:24,705 --> 01:32:25,664
Why have you kidnapped her?

1302
01:32:25,915 --> 01:32:28,500
Ka-kui, by the time you read this letter. . .

1303
01:32:28,751 --> 01:32:29,751
Stop!

1304
01:32:30,086 --> 01:32:31,086
. . . l've decided we should be apart.

1305
01:32:31,337 --> 01:32:32,837
No.

1306
01:32:33,089 --> 01:32:35,465
l don't think l'll see you again.

1307
01:32:35,716 --> 01:32:36,925
lt's a love letter!

1308
01:32:39,595 --> 01:32:43,181
Just like they say,
Unlucky in love, lucky in money.

1309
01:32:43,432 --> 01:32:44,599
There's more.

1310
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:45,600
Bastard!

1311
01:32:46,310 --> 01:32:49,646
When we met,
l thought you liked your job very much

1312
01:32:49,897 --> 01:32:52,899
and you'd be my Mr Right.

1313
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:54,859
Now l realise the only thing

1314
01:32:55,111 --> 01:32:58,029
that matters in your life is your work.

1315
01:32:58,281 --> 01:33:02,200
l tell myself that what
made me fall in love with you

1316
01:33:02,785 --> 01:33:06,538
is also what made me want to leave you.

1317
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:09,624
Yeah, why? Why did you break up?

1318
01:33:10,876 --> 01:33:14,462
You told me that you didn't want me involved...

1319
01:33:14,714 --> 01:33:16,006
with your work,

1320
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:17,299
but l didn't mind.

1321
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:20,135
You never spent enough time with me.

1322
01:33:20,386 --> 01:33:23,138
Being with you was the happiest time in my life.

1323
01:33:23,389 --> 01:33:25,223
But when you weren't there,

1324
01:33:25,474 --> 01:33:28,810
it was the worst time of my life.

1325
01:33:29,061 --> 01:33:30,228
That's not right.

1326
01:33:30,229 --> 01:33:32,856
lf l didn't leave you,

1327
01:33:33,107 --> 01:33:37,110
l'd spend my life waiting for you to come home. . .

1328
01:33:37,361 --> 01:33:39,070
Can't you stop it?!

1329
01:33:42,491 --> 01:33:44,034
She's crying!

1330
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:45,577
So is he.

1331
01:33:46,078 --> 01:33:48,371
Keep reading, go on.

1332
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:52,667
. . .because you can never stop being a policeman.

1333
01:33:53,044 --> 01:33:55,003
a policeman who never stops.

1334
01:33:55,421 --> 01:33:56,796
We're in trouble.

1335
01:33:57,381 --> 01:34:00,383
l think it's the right decision.

1336
01:34:01,218 --> 01:34:05,513
Please forgive me for making
such a selfish choice, May.

1337
01:34:10,561 --> 01:34:11,561
What do you want?

1338
01:34:12,063 --> 01:34:14,564
We want you to help us get rich.

1339
01:34:15,399 --> 01:34:18,068
Our speciality is blackmail

1340
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:23,198
and the hardest part of it is the pick up.

1341
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:26,493
You'll collect the ransom for us.

1342
01:34:26,744 --> 01:34:27,744
No way!

1343
01:34:27,995 --> 01:34:29,329
You don't have a choice.

1344
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:32,290
He said no.

1345
01:34:40,549 --> 01:34:41,925
l think you'll enjoy this.

1346
01:34:44,887 --> 01:34:46,638
Stop!

1347
01:34:46,889 --> 01:34:48,515
Don't!

1348
01:34:48,766 --> 01:34:51,434
Stop it! Please!

1349
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:53,269
Stop it!

1350
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:58,441
Please stop it!

1351
01:34:59,443 --> 01:35:00,902
Ka-kui, are you hurt?

1352
01:35:02,613 --> 01:35:03,988
Don't worry.

1353
01:35:06,575 --> 01:35:08,076
So you want to play the hero?

1354
01:35:26,262 --> 01:35:28,012
Now it's your turn.

1355
01:35:40,401 --> 01:35:42,110
Please don't!

1356
01:35:54,707 --> 01:35:55,915
You rotten swine!

1357
01:35:58,085 --> 01:35:59,335
Nice one!

1358
01:35:59,587 --> 01:36:00,628
Kill me if you have the guts.

1359
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,255
So tough!

1360
01:36:02,506 --> 01:36:06,342
Really? Let's see if his girl is tough, too.

1361
01:36:09,221 --> 01:36:10,513
What do you want?

1362
01:36:12,266 --> 01:36:16,728
How's that?! How's that?

1363
01:36:20,566 --> 01:36:22,692
Enough! You've made your point.

1364
01:36:23,819 --> 01:36:25,028
Does that mean you'll do it?

1365
01:36:25,654 --> 01:36:28,031
Just let her go. l'll do anything.

1366
01:36:28,282 --> 01:36:29,908
we won't let her go

1367
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:31,701
unless you help us.

1368
01:36:31,952 --> 01:36:32,994
What do you want me to do?

1369
01:36:33,245 --> 01:36:35,663
Collect the money for us.

1370
01:36:36,916 --> 01:36:38,291
You don't have any choice.

1371
01:36:47,885 --> 01:36:48,885
l'll do it.

1372
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:50,220
Good man.

1373
01:37:14,495 --> 01:37:16,454
l wouldn't advise you to remove it.

1374
01:37:16,997 --> 01:37:19,541
Break one wire and the whole thing blows.

1375
01:37:20,751 --> 01:37:23,211
The same thing happens if l press this button.

1376
01:37:29,718 --> 01:37:31,845
You'd better be careful.

1377
01:37:49,613 --> 01:37:50,738
Ka-kui.

1378
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:54,409
Be careful.

1379
01:37:55,911 --> 01:37:56,995
l'll come back for you.

1380
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:14,512
Ready?

1381
01:38:14,930 --> 01:38:15,805
He's on the line.

1382
01:38:15,806 --> 01:38:16,764
Trace the call.

1383
01:38:17,016 --> 01:38:17,974
l'll get Uncle Bill.

1384
01:38:19,852 --> 01:38:20,852
ls the money ready?

1385
01:38:21,103 --> 01:38:23,146
we'll collect it in 1 0 minutes.

1386
01:38:23,397 --> 01:38:24,439
lt's ready.

1387
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:25,690
Did you call the cops?

1388
01:38:25,941 --> 01:38:26,983
No.

1389
01:38:39,955 --> 01:38:40,872
Where's Ka-kui?

1390
01:38:40,873 --> 01:38:41,873
l can't find him.

1391
01:38:42,291 --> 01:38:44,584
How could he be so irresponsible?

1392
01:38:44,835 --> 01:38:45,585
l can't wait.

1393
01:38:45,586 --> 01:38:47,545
Don't take any risks.

1394
01:38:47,796 --> 01:38:48,963
Let's go.

1395
01:38:48,964 --> 01:38:49,923
Yes, sir.

1396
01:38:56,847 --> 01:38:59,933
You'll have 1 5 minutes to get back here again.
Just enough time

1397
01:39:00,225 --> 01:39:01,309
No tricks.

1398
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:03,561
lf we don't get our money,

1399
01:39:03,812 --> 01:39:05,605
your vest will go bang!

1400
01:39:07,274 --> 01:39:08,524
We'll be waiting.

1401
01:39:09,860 --> 01:39:11,235
Get going.

1402
01:39:16,116 --> 01:39:17,200
Good luck.

1403
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:26,417
Yes?

1404
01:39:26,418 --> 01:39:27,377
Police officers.

1405
01:39:30,255 --> 01:39:31,464
- Mr. Fung - Chairman

1406
01:39:31,715 --> 01:39:32,674
You will pay me.

1407
01:39:34,009 --> 01:39:35,134
How you know?

1408
01:39:35,636 --> 01:39:36,636
Please sit.

1409
01:39:38,305 --> 01:39:40,056
You promised to bug

1410
01:39:40,307 --> 01:39:43,685
We could check it.

1411
01:39:43,936 --> 01:39:45,728
lt's bad that you aren't that effective
when handling the bomb case.

1412
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:46,980
we have everything ready.

1413
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:48,481
Once they pay the money, we will have our action.

1414
01:39:48,732 --> 01:39:50,900
Hope you won't do anything to make anything worse.

1415
01:39:51,151 --> 01:39:52,735
Because this will encourage the bombers.

1416
01:39:52,987 --> 01:39:54,404
So they police couldn't help.

1417
01:39:54,655 --> 01:39:56,197
we could only depend on ourselves.

1418
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:04,038
Ka-kui, the boss was looking. . .

1419
01:40:04,289 --> 01:40:05,790
Ka-kui! lt's Ka-kui.

1420
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:07,583
Ka-kui!

1421
01:40:08,419 --> 01:40:10,169
- Ka-kui! - Out of my way.

1422
01:40:10,504 --> 01:40:13,464
Let me go!

1423
01:40:14,008 --> 01:40:16,259
Get out of my way!

1424
01:40:18,053 --> 01:40:19,846
Ka-kui!

1425
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:23,349
Excuse me.

1426
01:40:27,062 --> 01:40:28,187
Ka-kui.

1427
01:40:28,731 --> 01:40:30,023
Ka-kui, where have you been?

1428
01:40:30,274 --> 01:40:32,859
Never mind. l'm here to collect the money.

1429
01:40:33,110 --> 01:40:34,068
What?!

1430
01:40:34,319 --> 01:40:36,112
- ls he your man? - Yes, he is.

1431
01:40:36,363 --> 01:40:37,655
Ka-kui, what's going on?

1432
01:40:37,906 --> 01:40:41,325
we don't have much time. The money!

1433
01:40:49,376 --> 01:40:50,585
- What are you doing? - Ka-kui!

1434
01:40:50,836 --> 01:40:53,171
Move and l'll shoot you.

1435
01:40:53,422 --> 01:40:54,714
Don't pull the trigger.

1436
01:40:56,008 --> 01:40:57,050
No!

1437
01:40:57,301 --> 01:40:58,301
Don't push me.

1438
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:02,555
lf you shoot me, everybody here. . .

1439
01:41:03,182 --> 01:41:04,766
will be blown sky high.

1440
01:41:08,604 --> 01:41:11,105
lf one wire breaks, the whole thing will explode.

1441
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:13,733
Ka-kui, what's going on?

1442
01:41:13,984 --> 01:41:15,693
Can't we work this out?

1443
01:41:15,944 --> 01:41:18,196
lf l don't leave here in 1 0 minutes,
it will go off.

1444
01:41:18,614 --> 01:41:20,114
l don't have time!

1445
01:41:33,045 --> 01:41:34,378
Let him go. Please leave us.

1446
01:41:38,967 --> 01:41:39,926
Attention all units,

1447
01:41:40,344 --> 01:41:42,011
don't stop Ka-kui.

1448
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,024
- Ka-kui... - Get out of my way!

1449
01:41:55,275 --> 01:41:57,568
Don't follow me.

1450
01:41:58,112 --> 01:42:00,655
Ka-kui. . .

1451
01:42:00,906 --> 01:42:02,281
Get out of my way!

1452
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:15,503
l think he did it.

1453
01:42:15,504 --> 01:42:16,504
Great.

1454
01:42:18,507 --> 01:42:19,549
- Looks like he was followed. - Run.

1455
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:21,050
Let's go.

1456
01:42:45,033 --> 01:42:46,409
Tell him to move up.

1457
01:42:54,376 --> 01:42:55,334
Give me the money.

1458
01:42:55,335 --> 01:42:58,629
l'm being followed. Let me shake them off first.

1459
01:42:58,881 --> 01:43:00,089
Believe me.

1460
01:43:08,891 --> 01:43:10,183
Are the cops behind us?

1461
01:43:20,569 --> 01:43:22,153
Stay back! Don't come near.

1462
01:43:32,372 --> 01:43:34,332
Why did you stop here?

1463
01:43:38,879 --> 01:43:40,129
what are you doing?

1464
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:41,505
what's going on?

1465
01:43:41,757 --> 01:43:43,216
A bomb's about to blow. Run!

1466
01:43:43,926 --> 01:43:45,635
A bomb! Run!

1467
01:44:05,948 --> 01:44:07,073
There's no cops!

1468
01:44:07,324 --> 01:44:08,950
l'll blow him to bits.

1469
01:44:09,201 --> 01:44:11,369
Wait! what about the money?

1470
01:44:11,620 --> 01:44:14,413
And you can't get a radio signal in the tunnel.

1471
01:44:14,665 --> 01:44:15,581
what now?

1472
01:44:15,582 --> 01:44:17,667
We've got the girl. Don't worry. Let's go.

1473
01:44:17,918 --> 01:44:19,168
Maybe we should split up.

1474
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:48,799
No good to wait for him together

1475
01:45:50,635 --> 01:45:51,594
Wait here

1476
01:45:55,599 --> 01:45:57,141
Kill her if it goes wrong.

1477
01:46:57,035 --> 01:46:58,411
May.

1478
01:47:04,751 --> 01:47:06,210
Where is she?

1479
01:47:27,983 --> 01:47:29,692
Look, he's back.

1480
01:47:34,573 --> 01:47:36,323
l told you he wouldn't play tricks.

1481
01:47:58,680 --> 01:47:59,763
May!

1482
01:48:05,937 --> 01:48:07,188
Quiet.

1483
01:48:16,656 --> 01:48:19,158
Freeze! You're under arrest.

1484
01:48:19,784 --> 01:48:21,785
Really?

1485
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:24,079
Come on then, arrest us.

1486
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:25,748
Don't move.

1487
01:48:26,208 --> 01:48:27,625
Move and l'll shoot you.

1488
01:48:29,294 --> 01:48:32,046
You think so? You'd have to shoot fast.

1489
01:48:32,380 --> 01:48:33,672
There are three of us.

1490
01:48:34,591 --> 01:48:35,633
Think about it.

1491
01:48:35,884 --> 01:48:37,510
lf l don't shoot you,
you'll only spend years in jail.

1492
01:48:37,761 --> 01:48:40,804
And then you'll be a reformed person.

1493
01:48:41,097 --> 01:48:43,432
That's better than dying in this condition.

1494
01:48:43,683 --> 01:48:44,934
We are ready.

1495
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:46,685
we want to be rich.

1496
01:48:46,937 --> 01:48:48,521
Yes.

1497
01:48:48,980 --> 01:48:50,523
But you are way too cruel.

1498
01:48:50,774 --> 01:48:52,608
what is cruel? Fortune Maker

1499
01:48:52,859 --> 01:48:55,444
ln this society,
only if you do something good to the society,

1500
01:48:55,695 --> 01:48:57,571
everyone will help you. You will be repaid.

1501
01:48:57,822 --> 01:48:58,864
Then you will be rich.

1502
01:49:01,117 --> 01:49:03,202
And you will have new outlook.
That's what you could do.

1503
01:49:03,787 --> 01:49:04,995
Yet, now what you have done,

1504
01:49:05,247 --> 01:49:06,580
has harmed the society.

1505
01:49:06,831 --> 01:49:07,957
This is against everyone's benefit.

1506
01:49:08,208 --> 01:49:09,583
what does that mean?

1507
01:49:09,834 --> 01:49:11,168
Look. Beside you guys,

1508
01:49:11,419 --> 01:49:12,461
who will think you are doing the right thing?

1509
01:49:12,712 --> 01:49:14,129
Who would think of your purpose?

1510
01:49:17,175 --> 01:49:18,551
You are right.

1511
01:49:18,802 --> 01:49:22,429
Yes. That doesn't sound too bad,

1512
01:49:23,265 --> 01:49:24,390
we might take your advice.

1513
01:49:24,641 --> 01:49:27,184
But we're still young.

1514
01:49:27,644 --> 01:49:28,978
After we did our time,

1515
01:49:29,312 --> 01:49:30,688
we'd all be old men.

1516
01:49:33,233 --> 01:49:34,233
Don't push me!

1517
01:49:34,484 --> 01:49:36,944
Run! This is a fireworks factory.

1518
01:51:59,462 --> 01:52:00,421
May!

1519
01:52:00,422 --> 01:52:01,672
l'm over here!

1520
01:52:02,173 --> 01:52:03,340
Are you all right?

1521
01:52:10,432 --> 01:52:11,765
Ka-kui, be careful!

1522
01:52:32,370 --> 01:52:35,998
Good work!

1523
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:46,884
Ka-kui! Come here!

1524
01:52:47,135 --> 01:52:48,093
There's the rubbish chute.

1525
01:53:01,316 --> 01:53:02,816
There's an exit.

1526
01:53:05,445 --> 01:53:07,029
May, you go first.

1527
01:53:12,660 --> 01:53:14,036
lt looks too high.

1528
01:53:14,287 --> 01:53:15,662
Just jump.

1529
01:53:37,310 --> 01:53:38,894
Ka-kui, are you all right?

1530
01:53:40,021 --> 01:53:42,022
l'm fine. Get out of here, May. As far as you can.

1531
01:53:42,273 --> 01:53:43,524
Be careful.

1532
01:55:50,735 --> 01:55:53,862
Dad.

1533
01:55:54,822 --> 01:55:59,451
Do you want to try this yourself?

1534
01:55:59,702 --> 01:56:03,455
You want some more? Take this.

1535
01:56:05,625 --> 01:56:06,583
And more, bastard.

1536
01:56:06,834 --> 01:56:08,043
want some more?

1537
01:56:08,878 --> 01:56:11,129
You want some more? Here!

1538
01:56:12,465 --> 01:56:14,132
Bastard!

1539
01:56:14,509 --> 01:56:25,519
More?

1540
01:57:05,893 --> 01:57:06,893
Shit. Not enough. . .

1541
01:57:55,109 --> 01:57:56,902
Ka-kui!

1542
01:58:05,536 --> 01:58:06,870
Stop crying, OK?

1543
01:58:07,455 --> 01:58:08,997
Look, the fireworks are beautiful.
