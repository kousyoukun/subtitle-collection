00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,474
We managed to put Chu Tu behind bars

3
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,212
but the operation was a costly one.

4
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,946
You destroyed the squatter village

5
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,518
and the Government
had to rehouse the families.

6
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,057
and pay the redemption

7
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,718
Last time' during the operation

8
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:17,561
You damaged the shopping centre as well.

9
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,556
We paid over a million
for the chandelier alone.

10
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,535
But the taxpayers know

11
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,579
police work doesn't come cheaply.

12
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,839
But they don't expect to pay for

13
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:40,675
the cost of someone's heroism.

14
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,585
Why didn't you use the stairs?
Did you have to destroy that chandelier?

15
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,392
Do you always have to be different?

16
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:23,151
You're right.
This force doesn't need superstars.

17
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,028
We need disciplined policemen.

18
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,899
l wasn't expecting a promotion.

19
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,139
Ka-kui' the operation
succeeded through team effort'

20
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:34,839
not just because of you.

21
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:38,306
You should be grateful
that we didn't fire you.

22
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,337
And the bosses wanted you disciplined

23
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,876
for holding me as hostage.

24
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,751
l managed to talk them out of it.

25
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,310
l'm very grateful.

26
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,908
l worry about your individualism'

27
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,771
you're just a police officer.
Don't forget the point.

28
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:15,203
As of today' you're back in uniform.

29
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,741
You'll be assigned where needed.

30
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:19,977
You mean he'll be an errand boy?!

31
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:23,746
l think you'll be very busy.

32
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,064
What else do you do apart
from giving out tickets?

33
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,546
Calling all units'

34
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,324
there's been a serious road accident
at the lndustrial Park.

35
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:00,684
Traffic is brought to a standstill.

36
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,654
All units in the area please respond.

37
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,621
May' go home.
l'm working now.

38
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,091
Just think of me

39
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,489
as a member of the public.

40
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,494
And l want to talk to a policeman.

41
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:16,724
About what?

42
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,434
l think you look very smart in a uniform.

43
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,669
Stop it' l'm on duty.

44
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:23,831
l've brought you a cold drink.

45
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,707
Thank you.

46
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,513
Thank you' sir.

47
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:52,560
l can't drink here.

48
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,402
Go on' you need a break.

49
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,530
lf l have a drink'

50
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:56,769
l'll need the toilet soon.

51
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,099
Come on.

52
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,609
May' l'll get into trouble.

53
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,884
Hello' superhero!
You still haven't been sacked?!

54
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,987
You're lucky you're not in jail with Chu.

55
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,278
You think so?

56
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,529
The doctors said

57
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,189
l only had three months to live.

58
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:22,697
lt's called compassionate release.

59
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:26,429
Three months can pass quickly' very quickly.

60
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:30,904
My boss will be alive long after you're dead.

61
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,579
Don't you know you're threatening him?

62
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,647
Really? ln that case' he can sue me.

63
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,010
Just be careful!

64
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,141
Drive on.

65
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:45,846
Ka-kui?

66
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:14,951
Ka-Kui' Chu Tu is out from Jail.

67
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,244
l know' so?

68
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,545
You already knew? That's good then.

69
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,820
As a police
who wouldn't have caught a thief?

70
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,048
Who would you be scare of?

71
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:21,992
Just remember'

72
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,223
there are 250'000 Royal HK Police
at your back up.

73
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,060
Bill' are there really 250'000 police in HK?

74
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:29,731
Just because wer
are still recruiting new blood.

75
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:30,925
Didn't you notice newspaper ad?

76
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,227
What are you waiting for?

77
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:34,262
Go on patrol!

78
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,375
Hey' l've talked to Raymond.

79
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,704
He said you could carry a gun
even after work.

80
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,377
l'm very happy tonight.

81
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,882
The show and dinner were great.

82
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,987
But you don't seem very happy.

83
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,184
Really? l am happy.

84
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,723
l wish you had enjoyed it
as much as l did.

85
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,257
Are you worried about Chu?

86
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,234
No. But l'm just being careful.

87
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,402
Maybe next week...

88
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,436
Hey' superhero!

89
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,180
Off duty already?

90
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,341
What are you doing here?

91
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,712
l can park here'

92
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,779
you can't give me a ticket.

93
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,225
Yeah' you must have a nice view

94
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:29,483
from flat B of the first floor.
Am l right?

95
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,352
Go upstairs.

96
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:36,857
How did you find this address?

97
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,167
lt's amazing what information

98
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,934
you can get with money.

99
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:47,178
People will do anything for money'
you know?

100
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:48,838
What do you mean?

101
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,313
There's a narrow stairwell in the building.

102
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:55,018
lf there was a fire' it'd spread

103
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:56,883
rapidly through the building.

104
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,754
Because of the narrow access'

105
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,221
the fire brigade couldn't get in here.

106
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,986
Therefore' you'd better

107
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,663
keep a close eye on her.

108
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,465
lf she were to get her pretty ass burnt'

109
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:11,933
it'd ruin her marriage prospects.

110
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,094
Bastard!

111
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,944
Oh' hero' l'm so happy!

112
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,749
Sorry.

113
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,790
lt'd my fault really.

114
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,231
A police like me have lots of enemies
and you are threatened.

115
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,291
l'm not scared.

116
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:43,531
lf you don't have any enemies'

117
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,236
that means you couldn't catch a thief.

118
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,567
Could you rehouse yourself for a while?

119
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,606
Don't worry about me.

120
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,267
They are just morons.

121
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,273
No. We could be noticed
so easily while they won't

122
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,203
This way then'

123
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,547
l'll move to my aunt's and hide for a while.

124
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,141
Don't think about it too much.

125
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:04,018
But' if you threw a vase onto him
then l'll be dead definitely.

126
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:20,861
May.

127
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:22,997
Auntie.

128
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,270
You're on your own?
Where's Ka-kui?

129
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,706
He's still on duty.

130
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,345
lt's OK' l can manage.

131
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,945
l'm not against you dating a policeman'

132
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,708
but l don't want him to spend
too much time on his work.

133
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,143
He's stubborn' too.

134
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,713
But he's a good policeman.

135
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,983
That's why he has lots of enemies

136
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,184
and you have to move home.

137
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:43,794
l have to be careful.

138
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,054
That way' he doesn't need to worry about me.

139
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,396
He ought to worry about you.

140
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,225
Who are they?

141
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,426
lt was them last time.

142
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,536
l guess superhero isn't here.

143
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,404
Wait for me in the restaurant.

144
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,799
Right.

145
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:01,575
What do you want?
We have a score to settle.

146
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,111
l just want to know

147
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,009
where you're going.

148
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,173
lt's nothing to do with her.

149
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:11,045
You must be her mother. Am l right?

150
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:12,713
Bastard!

151
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:14,692
You call me a bastard?

152
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,658
Yes! l'm the bastard son of a bastard!

153
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,020
l'm not afraid of you.

154
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,055
Come on.

155
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,900
Auntie' why has your daughter
fallen for a cop?

156
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,366
That could be dangerous.

157
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,235
Living on the 19th floor
is dangerous' too.

158
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:34,913
What if you fall when
you're cleaning the windows?

159
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,004
Go ahead!

160
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,641
Don't be silly.

161
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,079
Go away.

162
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,579
Off!

163
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,853
You bastard.

164
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,182
Don't grab my hair.

165
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:49,925
You're hurting me.

166
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,288
You bitch.

167
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,227
Easy' she's just a girl.

168
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,334
Think yourself lucky.
lf you were a man' you'd be dead.

169
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,628
l won't forget this.

170
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,140
Come on.

171
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,502
You be careful!

172
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,000
Are you ok?

173
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,677
Auntie!

174
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,986
lt's your job that brings the enemies here.

175
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:20,586
Look' May was badly beaten because of you!

176
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,758
l've told you not to be with him.

177
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,022
Did John Ko attack you?

178
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,797
l started hitting him first.

179
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,336
He just hit me back.

180
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:33,028
And they knocked me down.

181
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,772
My backside still hurts.
l can't sit down now.

182
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:37,967
How did they know you'd be here?

183
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,075
They followed her.

184
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:41,678
That's how.

185
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:44,109
They're watching us from across the street.

186
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,813
l wonder what's next.

187
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,516
Ka-kui' don't!

188
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,153
He should go and scold them.

189
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:53,784
lf it's that simple'

190
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:55,885
then l'll be relieved.

191
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,778
ldiolt! Are you crazy?

192
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,431
What would you do beside bullying women?

193
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,942
lt's my favourite hobby.

194
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,190
Get the bastard!

195
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:25,703
You know the law' don't you?!

196
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:26,934
lf they did threaten her'

197
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,035
you could arrest them.

198
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,508
l don't care.

199
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,241
l got carried away.

200
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,082
That's not a good reason.

201
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,917
He reacted like anyone else would.

202
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,316
He's not anyone else.
He's a police officer.

203
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:39,921
What you've done is disgraceful!

204
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:41,115
lt has disgraced us the police.

205
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,127
l don't think so.

206
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,150
lf a policeman fails to respond to

207
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:44,318
a personal threat'

208
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,431
it's disgracefu.
And it disgraces the law' too.

209
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,099
You're a show-off.

210
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,289
So we won't forget you arrested Chu.

211
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,469
How can l explain this to the chief!

212
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,673
You don't have to. l quit.

213
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:07,285
You think that
will resolve the problem?

214
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,814
Why not?
This is probably the best solution.

215
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:13,480
l'll leave now.

216
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:18,059
Thank you for your support in the past.
Goodbye.

217
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,322
Ka-kui.

218
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:25,826
lf that's your last word'

219
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,967
then try to find a less stressful job.
Bye-bye.

220
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,437
l will.

221
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:35,976
You think you can do anything
because you're cops.

222
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:37,237
Don't you know the law?!

223
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:40,477
You can't beat me up just like that.
Kill me if you can.

224
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,481
Shut up and sign this.

225
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,949
l'm not signing anything.
No way!

226
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:48,224
l'll sue you for every penny
you've got.

227
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:51,486
l've got lots of money.
l'll get a lawyer. l'll sue you!

228
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,158
What?!

229
00:18:58,838 --> 00:18:59,827
No!

230
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:03,000
See? You saw this officer
try to assault me.

231
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,503
He wants to beat me up like before

232
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,869
when he hit me and broke my glasses.

233
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,046
You'll pay for that.

234
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,213
You would dare to beat me up here?

235
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,447
Come on. What are you waiting for?!

236
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,281
Come on. l'm going to sue you'
you're going to jail.

237
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,165
These youngsters have no patience.

238
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,601
Bill' why didn't you ask him to stay?

239
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,062
You should have said so!

240
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,664
l thought you meant
throw him out of here.

241
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:42,575
Now l know what this gesture means'
l'll remember it.

242
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,418
Ka-kui' what's the matter?

243
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,179
You don't want me to be a policeman' do you?

244
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,961
Of course l do' l'm proud of you.

245
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:58,996
What do l have after being a cop

246
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,058
for such a long time? Just enemies.

247
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,530
There you go!
That means you've done your job well.

248
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,432
lf a cop has no enemies'
there is only one reason:

249
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:07,628
he hasn't caught any crooks.

250
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,300
l'm glad they hate you!

251
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,567
lt proves that you're a tough good cop.

252
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:14,101
Thanks for that.

253
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,638
But l've had enough.

254
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,510
l resigned today.

255
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,540
Really?

256
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:21,518
Are you disappointed?

257
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,542
You're really quitting?!

258
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,417
l'm so happy!

259
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,115
Calm down.

260
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,018
What's she doing?!

261
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,194
May' for these years'
l haven't treat you as good as l should.

262
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,358
lt's my fault.

263
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:39,493
l have three months' holidays.

264
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,097
Let's go somewhere else to relax!

265
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:43,164
Ka-kui' you mean it?

266
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,808
Where to go then? Bali.

267
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:46,833
Good idea!

268
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,713
We haven't travel for years.

269
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,777
Right' so let's go.

270
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:55,280
lt feels good to fly on the plane.

271
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:02,055
That's $5'540' please.

272
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,183
Right.

273
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:06,887
l'll see you outside.

274
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,632
Credit card?
Sure.

275
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,337
Here's our catalogue' sir.

276
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,837
Thank you. Bye.

277
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,842
What clothes should l take?

278
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:29,614
You won't need any in Bali.

279
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:30,811
Don't be silly!

280
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:33,457
l can't believe we're going.

281
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:34,956
l just hope they won't rip us off.

282
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:36,885
No' they're a big company.

283
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:38,085
lt's trustworthy.

284
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:39,687
lt's paid for now.

285
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,226
Let's cross our fingers.

286
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,359
Fey!
Ka-kui.

287
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:45,392
ls this your area?

288
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:46,597
Yes.
What's up?

289
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,606
We've received a bomb threat
in here.

290
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:49,730
Really?

291
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,902
Yeah. Can you help us out?

292
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:55,535
All right' then. Thanks.

293
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:57,004
Ka-kui!

294
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,381
l'll just take a look' all right?

295
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:01,608
Sun.

296
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,043
Just in time. What's up?

297
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:05,119
We got a call about a bomb.

298
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,449
Are you sure it's real?

299
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:10,293
l don't think he was kidding.
He told us to clear the area.

300
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,793
We have ten minutes.

301
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:13,186
Really?

302
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:15,359
The manager said he's nuts.

303
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,670
Start clearing the building now.

304
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,269
There are too many people.

305
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,408
lf it's a hoax' who'll be to blame?

306
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:25,371
l'm used to getting an earful.

307
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:27,841
lf it is real' we'll endanger lives.

308
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,674
That's true.
What do we do?

309
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:33,378
Consider it real. Clear the building.
Call headquarters.

310
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,008
Where's the fire alarm?

311
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:37,044
Over there.

312
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:38,311
Ka-kui.

313
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,920
We'll go set off the fire alarm. Come on.

314
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,596
Your truncheon. But...

315
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:49,723
Come on' l'll bear the consquence.

316
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:54,795
Follow me.

317
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,080
Don't panic. Don't worry.

318
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:12,084
Come back. l've opened the till already.

319
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:14,181
Have they paid?

320
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:16,961
What's going on?

321
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,223
lt's nothing.

322
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,828
What should we do?
They're not taking any notice.

323
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:26,993
Ka-kui.

324
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,774
Don't stay here. Go on!

325
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:34,944
Your attention please'
evacuate the building.

326
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:38,479
Everybody please leave immediately.

327
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,651
There's a fire in the building.

328
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,578
Please leave now.

329
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,352
Please leave in an orderly manner.

330
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,223
Everybody outside.

331
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:50,650
Be careful.

332
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,133
What's going on? Why the alarm's on?

333
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:02,097
How about our business?

334
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,339
Fay.
What's up?

335
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,436
Get them out of here.

336
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:11,876
This is for your own safety. Go now!

337
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,674
What about you?

338
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,077
l won't be long. You go first.

339
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:20,149
Check the building.

340
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,242
l can't understand this. lt's crazy!

341
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,072
Who's in charge?

342
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:47,207
You talk to them.

343
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,145
Please leave here now'
the police will take care of it.

344
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:53,515
Ka-kui. Ka-kui!

345
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,820
l'm all right. You go home first.

346
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:03,190
Hello' sir.

347
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:04,457
Who made the call?

348
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,467
We received a call

349
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,002
but we didn't know if it was a hoax.

350
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,263
Who set off the alarm?

351
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:12,999
lt was me' sir.

352
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:15,535
You may leave.

353
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,314
Why did you do it?

354
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,382
Sir' when l was in the Police Academy'

355
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,579
l was taught that

356
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:28,259
public safety comes first.

357
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:29,482
So l set off the alarm.

358
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,323
Do you think
you're indispensable?

359
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:36,564
Superintendent. There's no fire.

360
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:39,369
But it was your men
who cleared the building.

361
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:42,096
Right. The Bomb Disposal Unit are coming.

362
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:43,569
You won't be needed now.

363
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:45,936
Right. l hope this isn't a hoax.

364
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:47,437
Uncle Bill. So do l.

365
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,171
Raymond. They want to see
the head man.

366
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:51,748
Shall l go?

367
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,045
Where's the Bomb Disposal Unit?
On their way.

368
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,013
What a mess.

369
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:01,182
Did l do the right thing?

370
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,519
How do l do know? Don't ask me.

371
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:05,690
Right now'

372
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:08,623
we have to wait and see.

373
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:09,756
Tell them to leave.

374
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:11,930
You can go back in very soon.

375
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:14,135
My ball!

376
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,052
When can we go back in?

377
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:40,353
Now what?

378
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:41,161
Very soon.

379
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,131
Here's your ball.

380
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,156
Thank you.

381
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:50,864
Ready?

382
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,103
The Bomb Disposal Unit are here.

383
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:54,774
lf they don't find anything'

384
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:57,170
the boss will blow a fuse.

385
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,239
Uncle Bill' l'm very sorry.

386
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:01,179
l'm not...

387
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:15,955
Red alert!

388
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:16,990
All units move in.

389
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:19,170
Go and fight the fire. Go on.

390
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:33,213
l suppose the good news is
nobody got hurt.

391
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:34,374
What are the losses?

392
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,512
The insurance will cover it.

393
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,382
l'm more worried about
the damage to our image.

394
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,952
l've asked the press to cooperate
and l'm sure they will.

395
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:46,230
But who did it and why our company?

396
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:47,957
lt may not be against us.

397
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,995
lt could be someone
who's mentally disturbed.

398
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:55,300
There's a man on the line' sir.

399
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:56,973
He says he planted the bomb.

400
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:58,531
Have it put through.

401
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:00,900
Put him through.

402
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:02,836
Hello? Hold on.

403
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,980
Listen' we planted the bomb
in your shopping centre.

404
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,816
We want $10 million.

405
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,318
Pay up or your...
other properties will get bombed.

406
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:12,812
Let me talk to him.

407
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,922
All right.

408
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,721
But it's a huge amount of money.

409
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,092
We'll need to call a board meeting.

410
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:20,559
You've got 24 hours.

411
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:22,024
Don't call the police.

412
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:25,158
What to do then?

413
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:27,567
Must be some hoax.

414
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:28,962
Yes.

415
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:30,371
So what do we do?

416
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,531
Call the police.

417
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:32,732
We pay so much tax.

418
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:34,275
The police should do something for us.

419
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:36,771
Call the head for me.

420
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:37,837
Yes.

421
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,748
Raymond' you were extremely lucky.

422
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:43,283
lt's amazing that no one
was hurt in the explosion.

423
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,920
Thank God for that.

424
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:48,223
And the Chu case' well done!

425
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,223
Thank you. But it wasn't just me.

426
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:51,885
That's right.

427
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,124
You've proved yourself.

428
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,299
You should handle this case. Do you agree?

429
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,900
Sure. Of course.

430
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:01,528
Bill.

431
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:03,999
This is a very tough case.

432
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:06,071
That's why they gave it to us.

433
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:09,443
ln our department'
who do you think can solve it?

434
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:11,777
You're the only one.

435
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:13,206
l want a better idea.

436
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,316
And it's definitely not me.

437
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,223
Maybe we could bring back
somebody who's on leave.

438
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,684
Do you mean somebody like Ka-kui?

439
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:23,283
He has good experience.

440
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:26,931
l don't know.
He's unorthodox' impulsive.

441
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,256
He'll only give us trouble.
We have to bear the consquence

442
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,503
l agree he's a little bit rash'
but underneath he's a good cop.

443
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:34,461
l won't let him do it.

444
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,972
But if you think he's our man'
you go find him.

445
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,242
Let's see who's the boss.

446
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:58,318
Over there.

447
00:29:58,363 --> 00:29:59,352
Here?

448
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:09,262
Fasten your seat belt please.

449
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:11,832
l forgot the sun screen...

450
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,170
Buy it when we get there.

451
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:17,181
Did you get your passport?
When you were young?

452
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:20,708
Put out a call
for Detective Chan Ka-kui.

453
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:21,875
Sure.

454
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:24,715
Attention please.

455
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,556
Will Chan Ka-kui....

456
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:28,115
Let me see.
No' don't look!

457
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,024
lt's cute.
lt's horrible.

458
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:32,430
..Ka-kui please contact us.

459
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:33,431
That's you. Yeah.

460
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:35,057
What's up?
l don't know.

461
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,226
l won't be long.

462
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:41,029
Are you Mr Chan?
Yeah.

463
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:43,233
l'm afraid there seems to be

464
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:44,533
a problem with your passport.

465
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,099
Really?

466
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:47,505
lt'll just be a quick check.

467
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:50,570
What's going on?

468
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:53,306
l'll be back right away.

469
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,941
Hurry!

470
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,209
OK

471
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:58,778
Bye-bye.

472
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:12,458
What do you want?

473
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:15,003
Thank you.
You're welcome.

474
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,132
What is it? l have a plane waiting.

475
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:18,234
We have a problem.

476
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:22,138
lt seems that the bombing case
has become a blackmail case.

477
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:23,947
And it's a very tough one.

478
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:24,914
So?

479
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,713
This case is a real challenge.

480
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,007
Raymond was hoping...

481
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:31,618
l was hoping that you might
cancel your holiday.

482
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:34,522
No! l've already boarded the plane.

483
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,386
And l've quit.

484
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,550
l know how you feel.

485
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,826
You've been under pressure lately.

486
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,323
But ducking out like this?

487
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,689
l'm not ducking out.

488
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:44,692
He said he's not ducking out!

489
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:50,399
Raymond is a great admirer of your abilities.

490
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,511
l don't have any abilities.
l'm too impulsive.

491
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:57,344
lmpulsive? More a man of action.

492
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:59,974
lf only l could control my actions.

493
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,742
A true man of action
is one who acts upon instinct.

494
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:05,952
l think the police force

495
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:07,113
needs men with discipline.

496
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,158
lnstinctive men have to be unconventional'

497
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,391
even at the cost of discipline.

498
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,494
lf you did everything by the book'
no cases would be solved. Am l right?

499
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,023
Absolutely.

500
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,759
l'd better get back on board.

501
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:23,196
You're right.

502
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:24,931
Goodbye.

503
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:30,737
How much is the ransom?

504
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:33,113
Ten million. That's all we know.

505
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:34,374
Do we have any suspects?

506
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:35,842
Not a clue.

507
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:38,647
Do you think these people are insane?

508
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:40,953
Why are you asking me? l don't know.

509
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,392
Have you traced the dynamite?

510
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:45,927
Why?

511
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:47,186
Yes. Why?

512
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:48,221
Simple.

513
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,700
Dynamite is a controlled substance.

514
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:53,495
So you either smuggle it in

515
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,262
or steal it from a local company.

516
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:58,106
He's right. We'd not thought of that.

517
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,602
We must find their bomb factory

518
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:02,312
before the company pays the ransom.

519
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,548
lf we do that' we can foil their plans.

520
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:07,584
Why can you always solve problems
so easily?

521
00:33:07,886 --> 00:33:09,410
You're the one
who's made for this case.

522
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:10,849
You're in charge.

523
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,814
l've got a plane to catch.

524
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:18,822
Wait! Ka-kui.

525
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:19,952
You can go there any time.

526
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,023
This case is a one-off.

527
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:23,623
Go there next time. OK?

528
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,099
l'd better talk to May first.

529
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:28,461
Hurry up' then.

530
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:34,934
Hurry up.

531
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,574
Miss!
Yes' sir?

532
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:39,276
My plane...
lt just took off.

533
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,309
lt's taken off!

534
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,853
You've missed your flight!

535
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:47,820
Trust them to be on schedule.

536
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:50,790
l still have May's passport.

537
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:54,224
Damn! lt sure isn't your lucky day!

538
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:57,724
Now what?

539
00:34:07,946 --> 00:34:09,038
Uncle Bill' we better go.

540
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:12,271
All right?

541
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:13,306
l ate something bad.

542
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,509
That way' sir.

543
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,543
Thank you.

544
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:21,358
Excuse me. We're police officers.
We're here to see Miss Wong.

545
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:22,682
30th floor.

546
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:23,883
Thank you.

547
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:27,453
Bugging devices.

548
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:28,992
Bugging?

549
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:30,994
Be careful' Nixon lost his job
because of one of these.

550
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,158
lf we are to solve the case'

551
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,630
we have to know our targets well.
We're counting on you.

552
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:37,463
Put them away.

553
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:42,244
Miss Wong'
there are two police officers here.

554
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:43,436
Where's the loo?

555
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:44,904
On your right.

556
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:46,105
Thanks.

557
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,609
25 please.

558
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:52,445
24 please.

559
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:55,615
Wait!

560
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:59,995
Uncle Bill' l'm really worried about May.

561
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,290
l'll call Jakarta airport
as soon as l get to the office.

562
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:15,677
Uncle Bill.

563
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:29,091
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Haven't you got any manners?

564
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,094
Let's use the other elevators.

565
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,339
Detective Chan
to see Miss Wong.

566
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,471
lf you'll please wait.

567
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:53,506
Thank you.

568
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:58,878
Ka-Kui

569
00:35:58,957 --> 00:35:59,946
Uncle Bill

570
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:04,127
l thought you were used to taking the blame.

571
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,129
That's no excuse!

572
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:07,386
Gentlemen.

573
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,432
l'm Detective Chang' this is Detective Chan.

574
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:10,556
We...

575
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:12,092
Please come with me.

576
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:14,263
We're...
l know. Mr Fung is busy now

577
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:16,507
but he's signed the papers.

578
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:24,537
Excuse me.

579
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:31,547
Excuse me' where's the toilet?

580
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:32,712
Down the corridor.

581
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:34,647
Here' sir.

582
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:36,282
l'm so sorry.

583
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,256
lt's OK. Where's your friend?

584
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:42,994
He had a sudden urge.

585
00:36:58,917 --> 00:36:59,906
There's the chairman.

586
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,208
That site is worth three billion.
There would be a profit.

587
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,050
Chairman'
Yes?

588
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:05,885
Detective Chan is here.
Thank you.

589
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:06,913
Thanks for all your help.

590
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:12,861
You're developing the new estates very fast.

591
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:26,032
Please sit.

592
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,245
Welcome to all directors'
managers and heads.

593
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,617
l've called this meeting
to review the performance

594
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,812
of our property portfolio

595
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:40,782
and to set the sales target
for the next year.

596
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:42,892
You may all know that

597
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,618
since the collapse of

598
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,954
the stock market last year'

599
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,757
the Hang Seng lndex has risen 66%.

600
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:53,594
Let me show you the performance

601
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,204
of the major blue chip shares.

602
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:20,756
However' by the performance of
the bank and property sectors'

603
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,824
the outlook of the stock market for

604
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:26,300
the next half year remains uncertain.

605
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,268
ln situations like this'

606
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:33,476
small investors are likely
to put their money in property.

607
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,085
So we have to accelerate the pace of

608
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,884
developing our new housing estates.

609
00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:57,223
Hi' you're gorgeous.

610
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,070
lf someone asks the chairman

611
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,305
for this' it's $500 to get it back.

612
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:12,772
Really?

613
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:13,806
Yeah. Bye-bye.

614
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:15,975
What happened?

615
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,146
lt's a meeting.

616
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:18,685
Did you plant the bugs?

617
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,619
Sure.
And the desk?

618
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:22,523
All done.
Was it easy?

619
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,549
He wasn't against it!

620
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:27,987
What was said?

621
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,021
Something about houses.

622
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,122
Really?

623
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:32,068
Where are you going?
l'll take the next one.

624
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,116
May's here.

625
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:04,023
May' you're back!

626
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:05,925
May.

627
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:07,426
You scumbag!

628
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,028
Let me explain.

629
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,006
You...
You didn't want me to come back!

630
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,403
You left me there

631
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:16,806
and took my passport!

632
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:19,516
When l got there' l couldn't do anything.

633
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:21,580
Before l was sent back here'

634
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:24,583
they detained me for ten hours in a cell!

635
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:26,823
Why should l keep my voice down?

636
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:30,055
When you take your dog for a walk'

637
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,727
do you not take him home afterwards?

638
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,295
l'm even worse than a dog.

639
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,089
May' they're watching us.

640
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,667
What are you staring at?

641
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:41,096
lt's none of your business!

642
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:43,871
l want you to tell me
in front of everyone

643
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:45,803
what you think l am.

644
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:47,376
What the hell do you take me for?

645
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:49,273
You're my girlfriend!

646
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,177
Your girlfriend?! Open up! Open up!

647
00:40:57,922 --> 00:40:59,890
lf that's true'
why treat me that way?

648
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:02,820
You even treat strangers
better than me.

649
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,084
Let me tell you...

650
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,631
it's over between us!

651
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,706
Chan Ka-kui' you bastard!

652
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:29,018
Uncle Bill' did you make that call?

653
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,454
l needed to go to the toilet.

654
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:32,781
You've ruined my life.

655
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:47,092
Wait!

656
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:49,333
Go away or l'll run you over.

657
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:50,930
Go away!

658
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:51,964
Don't be childish!

659
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,338
Don't grab my bag! Go away!

660
00:41:57,582 --> 00:42:00,244
Don't even touch me. Go away.
Leave me alone.

661
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:01,510
Let me explain.

662
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:03,013
l don't want to know.

663
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,049
l've nothing else to say to you.

664
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,181
May!

665
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:11,923
May' are you all right?

666
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,156
Stay away from me.
Don't touch my motorbike.

667
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,731
Keep away.
l don't want you anywhere near me.

668
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:18,857
Let me explain.

669
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:19,892
Keep away.

670
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,574
Why won't you help me?!

671
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:30,574
Just keep away from me.
l don't want to see you again.

672
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,478
May.

673
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,743
All right' get back to work.
l want to see Ka-kui.

674
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,918
Ka-kui' the boss wants to see you.

675
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,067
l'm sorry' sir.

676
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:54,193
lt's all right.

677
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,865
Do you want to call May to explain?

678
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,635
l don't think it would help.

679
00:42:57,808 --> 00:43:00,208
Don't explain to women!
This is my way to treat my woman.

680
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:01,638
lf a man's not at home'

681
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,038
it's obvious he's working.

682
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,776
Excuse me' l have to go to the toilet.

683
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:08,312
Don't take any notice of his chauvinism.

684
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:09,541
Go get changed.

685
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:42,008
Are you going home' May?

686
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,480
lt's better than wasting my time here.
Good night.

687
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:47,850
Can l walk you home?

688
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:49,982
No thanks.

689
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,367
Don't be foolish.

690
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:58,625
No' l won't.

691
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,835
Get me' it's me you want.

692
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:02,027
Don't be foolish.

693
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:04,541
You're in this together.

694
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:05,731
Don't try anything.

695
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:09,143
Prepare to die!

696
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:16,886
l really had you going! l got the both of you!

697
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:19,845
Ka-kui!

698
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:32,991
l've found it.

699
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:47,784
Looks like you're outnumbered.

700
00:44:47,952 --> 00:44:48,941
lf l knew it's merely an easy game

701
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:51,816
l won't call my men to come.

702
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,345
l'm flattered.

703
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,717
My boss asked me
to teach you a lesson.

704
00:44:56,961 --> 00:44:58,986
l'm paid to do it.

705
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,356
But l don't need to dirty my hands'

706
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:02,828
my men can take care of you.

707
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,292
Get on with it.

708
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:06,635
We'll give you a chance.

709
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:09,032
lf you apologise to Mr Ko now'

710
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:11,036
we won't break both of your legs.

711
00:45:11,242 --> 00:45:12,937
We'll just break one of them.

712
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,801
Cut the bullshit. Go on' kill me.

713
00:45:16,147 --> 00:45:18,172
Kill a cop? No' l don't think so.

714
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,872
My boss wants to teach you a lesson.

715
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:23,052
Ripping a few limbs off should do the trick.

716
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:31,817
Get him!

717
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:34,789
Go!

718
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,343
There he is. Beat him up!

719
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,044
Go on' finish him off.
Get up.

720
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,529
Move over. Let me drive.

721
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:10,579
l'll turn you into mashed banana.

722
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,101
lt wasn't my fault! l was paid to do it.

723
00:48:51,996 --> 00:48:54,726
Keep away or l'll shoot!

724
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:55,595
Shoot me!

725
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:56,429
l'll shoot.

726
00:48:56,467 --> 00:48:57,161
Shoot here!

727
00:48:57,201 --> 00:48:58,190
lt's not my fault.

728
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:08,971
lt's not. lt's not my fault.

729
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:10,373
Next time l'll kick your ass.

730
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,980
lt's not my fault.

731
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:22,147
May.

732
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:23,382
May. Did they hurt you?

733
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:25,350
l'm all right.

734
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:28,420
You'd better be careful.

735
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:33,430
Why did you chase him? lt's dangerous.

736
00:49:33,871 --> 00:49:35,839
l wanted to make things up to you.

737
00:49:36,407 --> 00:49:39,399
lf it had been acid in that pistol
and not ink'

738
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:42,368
l'd have been scarred.

739
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,212
Maybe they wanted to distract you
and then kidnap me.

740
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:47,739
Then what would happen?

741
00:49:49,887 --> 00:49:53,323
Ka-kui' l want my boyfriend
to be gentle'

742
00:49:53,691 --> 00:49:57,422
not a savage. Do you understand?

743
00:50:07,538 --> 00:50:08,527
Come in.

744
00:50:12,076 --> 00:50:13,065
Good morning.

745
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:17,678
Police detective in park rumpus.
Who was that?

746
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:19,204
Look!

747
00:50:21,985 --> 00:50:23,145
l'll check out the surveillance team.

748
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:36,188
lt was me.

749
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,129
l know Chu wants revenge'

750
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:44,371
but don't take the law into your own hands.

751
00:50:44,575 --> 00:50:45,667
Sorry' sir.

752
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:47,499
Anything l can do?

753
00:50:47,845 --> 00:50:50,109
No' thanks.

754
00:50:50,314 --> 00:50:52,043
l can cope with it.
l just want them to leave me alone.

755
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:54,912
All right. But keep your eyes open.

756
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:58,053
Now we've got a surveillance team.

757
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:01,220
They're very good.
Go and talk to them.

758
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:11,929
Did he give you an earful? Did he...

759
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:14,292
Let's go over there.

760
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:18,567
He just want to help.

761
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,673
How to show off if there is no audience?

762
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,384
Sir'

763
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:39,317
let me introduce.

764
00:51:39,363 --> 00:51:40,660
This is Detective Chan Ka-kui;

765
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:42,222
Detective Ng' Detective Mui.

766
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,389
Hello.

767
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:45,423
You guys intoduce yourselves.

768
00:51:45,903 --> 00:51:47,234
Sum Kin

769
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:49,372
They are the special tactic unit.

770
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:50,662
Please take a seat.

771
00:51:51,008 --> 00:51:52,669
They are expertised in following targets.

772
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:56,277
But why?
Will this be useful for the case?

773
00:51:56,814 --> 00:51:59,305
Because we don't even know who did it.

774
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:00,539
That's easy.

775
00:52:00,818 --> 00:52:03,184
Follow anyone suspicious
then you'll know.

776
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:04,476
Follow the suspects

777
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:06,989
then we could find the their hiding place
for making bombs.

778
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:08,847
Just to follow them during the transaction'

779
00:52:08,926 --> 00:52:10,985
then we could arrest them.

780
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:12,250
That simple?

781
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:13,058
Of course.

782
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:15,121
Good' that's why l always have faith on you.

783
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:16,860
Hope you have a smooth cooperation.

784
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,032
Detective Ng' could l have a word with you?

785
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:21,795
There will be room for you soon.

786
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:23,295
Go.

787
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,331
Bye.
Bye.

788
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:29,402
Detective Chan.
Yes.

789
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:31,010
What does that mean?

790
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,884
Because you are cool.

791
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:45,383
Anything yet?

792
00:52:46,129 --> 00:52:48,859
Fung said his shares would go up.

793
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:50,894
That's hardly relevant.

794
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:53,932
And his girlfriend is a top model!

795
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:55,565
l'm not interested.

796
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:58,466
l'll take it. You go call May.

797
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:01,633
Go on.

798
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,342
Ka-kui! Listen.

799
00:53:13,257 --> 00:53:15,020
Your conditions have been presented

800
00:53:15,893 --> 00:53:17,121
to the board and they will pay.

801
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:19,485
No shit. Do you have the money?

802
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:20,787
We don't have it all.

803
00:53:21,265 --> 00:53:23,631
$10 million is a lot of money.

804
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,023
Trace it.

805
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,531
lt's from Tai Po.

806
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:34,566
Check it out.

807
00:53:54,665 --> 00:53:55,654
He's in Ting Kok Road.

808
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,189
HQ calling all foot patrols.

809
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:01,602
Are there any units in Ting Kok Road' over?

810
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:07,203
This is PC 12674 on Ting Kok Road'
over.

811
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,075
PC 12674'

812
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:11,643
check anybody leaving
a phone box in the area.

813
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:16,378
Are you stalling for time?

814
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,588
No' we didn't call the police.

815
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:20,254
Now we want 20 million.

816
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:24,052
20 million! lt's impossible.

817
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:25,417
Find it.

818
00:54:25,796 --> 00:54:27,058
Wait!

819
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:37,028
This is PC 12674.

820
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:38,296
Anything?

821
00:54:38,342 --> 00:54:39,866
l think l've got a suspect.

822
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:41,635
Be careful. He's very dangerous.

823
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:43,470
He could be armed.

824
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,107
Keep everything low key.

825
00:54:54,925 --> 00:54:58,417
Excuse me' you're supposed to use
the pedestrian crossing.

826
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:00,919
Go on.

827
00:55:01,365 --> 00:55:02,662
Give me a chance' Officer.

828
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:04,222
Can l see your lD card?

829
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:17,702
Calling HQ...

830
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:29,554
PC 12674' can you hear...

831
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:39,396
An officer needs assistance
in Ting Kok Road.

832
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:44,870
l'm sorry' he isn't here.

833
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:46,564
Don't be sorry.

834
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:49,909
lt's the way things go.
lt wasn't your fault.

835
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:52,609
How long have you been in uniform?

836
00:55:52,883 --> 00:55:54,316
About two months.

837
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:56,743
Then you're excused.

838
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,682
Will l get in trouble
for losing my gun?

839
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,248
What about promotions?!

840
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:04,325
Don't worry.
As long as you learn

841
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:06,894
from the experience' it's OK.

842
00:56:07,164 --> 00:56:08,153
lt happens to every cop.

843
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,187
lt won't happen again.

844
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:10,799
Do you think you'd recognise him?

845
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:11,923
Sure.

846
00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:13,058
Phone.

847
00:56:13,637 --> 00:56:15,195
l could do with someone like you on the team.

848
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:16,561
l'll see to it.

849
00:56:18,909 --> 00:56:20,706
Thank you. Can you file this for me?

850
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:24,310
Hello.

Go ahead.

00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:28,578
A guy called Crazy Fai sells dynamite.

854
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:30,285
Nine o'clock' Hoi Wong Bar.

855
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,564
Do you know what we'll do next?
No.

856
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:49,594
Really?

857
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:56,334
What do you want?

858
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:57,937
Are you Fai? l want to talk.

859
00:56:58,982 --> 00:56:59,971
Do l know you?

860
00:57:00,117 --> 00:57:01,379
No. But you will.

861
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,953
All right. Let's go over there.

862
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:07,378

863

What's your name?
Lo.

864
00:57:14,865 --> 00:57:15,854
What do you want?

865
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,360
Some explosives.

866
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,257
Explosives?

867
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:20,530
Do you have some?

868
00:57:20,704 --> 00:57:22,729
What are they for?
Fishing.

869
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:25,907
You don't look like a fisherman.

870
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,240
What if l told you it was for business?

871
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:29,400
l'll give you a good price.

872
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:31,738
What do you say?

873
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:36,579
All right' l need to speak to someone.

874
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,544
lt's not my stuff.
Don't go away.

875
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,111
Thanks.

876
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:03,537
Sorry' he's out of stock

877
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:06,074
but he'll call me back.

878
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,784
Stay here' l'll be back
when l've finished.

879
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:09,807
Thank you.

880
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:56,790
Hey' you. Stand up.

881
00:58:58,368 --> 00:58:59,426
What's the matter?

882
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:01,266
ClD. On your feet.

883
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:13,938
Hands up.

884
00:59:13,984 --> 00:59:15,144
l only came for a drink.

885
00:59:15,185 --> 00:59:15,879
A drink?

886
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:17,477
We heard you were dealing contraband.

887
00:59:20,991 --> 00:59:21,980
Eyes front.

888
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:34,199
Hold it.
Throw me your gun. Quick!

889
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:39,897
Stand over there.

890
00:59:40,644 --> 00:59:42,441
Easy. Don't do anything stupid.

891
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:56,524
Come on. Move.

892
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,157
Come out here!

893
01:01:01,558 --> 01:01:02,547
Get lost.

894
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:07,126
You screwed me over. You bastard!
Why did you call the cops?

895
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,634
Stop! Stop it!

896
01:01:17,574 --> 01:01:20,236
Please' that's enough. Please stop.

897
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:22,433
Why did you do it?

898
01:01:22,479 --> 01:01:24,140
To make sure you weren't a cop.

899
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,008
That's why l called the cops to prove it.

900
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:27,978
l can get what you need.

901
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:29,540
Where is it?

902
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:30,675
Have you got the money?

903
01:01:36,126 --> 01:01:37,423
lt's cash on delivery.

904
01:01:41,682 --> 01:01:42,671
Keep a look out.

905
01:01:57,799 --> 01:01:58,788
ls it good stuff?

906
01:01:59,066 --> 01:02:00,465
lt's from the quarries.

907
01:02:01,235 --> 01:02:02,224
Got any more?

908
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:03,459
Yeah' plenty.

909
01:02:11,345 --> 01:02:13,540
There's enough to blow up
the Empire State Building.

910
01:02:14,749 --> 01:02:16,910
l just met him!

911
01:02:17,118 --> 01:02:18,210
l've never seen him before!

912
01:02:22,056 --> 01:02:23,045
Do you think you can get away?
