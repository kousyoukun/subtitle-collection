1
00:03:05,216 --> 00:03:06,774
We managed to put Chu Tu behind bars

2
00:03:07,351 --> 00:03:09,512
but the operation was a costly one.

3
00:03:10,688 --> 00:03:12,246
You destroyed the squatter village

4
00:03:12,657 --> 00:03:14,818
and the Government
had to rehouse the families.

5
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:16,357
And pay the redemption

6
00:03:16,994 --> 00:03:18,018
Last time, during the operation

7
00:03:18,462 --> 00:03:19,861
You damaged the shopping centre as well.

8
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:22,856
We paid over a million
for the chandelier alone.

9
00:03:35,846 --> 00:03:36,835
But the taxpayers know

10
00:03:37,014 --> 00:03:38,879
police work doesn't come cheaply.

11
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,139
But they don't expect to pay for

12
00:03:40,484 --> 00:03:42,975
the cost of someone's heroism.

13
00:03:44,121 --> 00:03:46,885
Why didn't you use the stairs?
Did you have to destroy that chandelier?

14
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:49,692
Do you always have to be different?

15
00:04:21,993 --> 00:04:25,451
You're right.
This force doesn't need superstars.

16
00:04:25,963 --> 00:04:27,328
We need disciplined policemen.

17
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:32,199
I wasn't expecting a promotion.

18
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,439
Ka-kui, the operation
succeeded through team effort,

19
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:37,139
not just because of you.

20
00:04:37,808 --> 00:04:40,606
You should be grateful
that we didn't fire you.

21
00:04:41,112 --> 00:04:43,637
And the bosses wanted you disciplined

22
00:04:43,914 --> 00:04:45,176
for holding me as hostage.

23
00:04:46,117 --> 00:04:48,051
I managed to talk them out of it.

24
00:04:48,552 --> 00:04:49,610
I'm very grateful.

25
00:05:10,308 --> 00:05:12,208
I worry about your individualism,

26
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,071
you're just a police officer.
Don't forget the point.

27
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:17,503
As of today, you're back in uniform.

28
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:20,041
You'll be assigned where needed.

29
00:05:21,185 --> 00:05:22,277
You mean he'll be an errand boy?!

30
00:05:25,022 --> 00:05:26,046
I think you'll be very busy.

31
00:05:35,032 --> 00:05:37,364
What else do you do apart
from giving out tickets?

32
00:05:57,822 --> 00:05:58,846
Calling all units,

33
00:05:59,156 --> 00:06:01,624
there's been a serious road accident
at the Industrial Park.

34
00:06:01,892 --> 00:06:02,984
Traffic is brought to a standstill.

35
00:06:03,327 --> 00:06:04,954
All units in the area please respond.

36
00:07:09,794 --> 00:07:11,921
May, go home.
I'm working now.

37
00:07:12,163 --> 00:07:13,391
Just think of me

38
00:07:13,697 --> 00:07:14,789
as a member of the public.

39
00:07:15,132 --> 00:07:17,794
And I want to talk to a policeman.

40
00:07:18,035 --> 00:07:19,024
About what?

41
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,734
I think you look very smart in a uniform.

42
00:07:23,274 --> 00:07:24,969
Stop it, I'm on duty.

43
00:07:25,142 --> 00:07:26,131
I've brought you a cold drink.

44
00:07:33,517 --> 00:07:35,007
Thank you.

45
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:37,813
Thank you, sir.

46
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:54,860
I can't drink here.

47
00:07:54,905 --> 00:07:56,702
Go on, you need a break.

48
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:57,830
If I have a drink,

49
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,069
I'll need the toilet soon.

50
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,399
Come on.

51
00:08:01,078 --> 00:08:02,909
May, I'll get into trouble.

52
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:08,184
Hello, superhero!
You still haven't been sacked?!

53
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,287
You're lucky you're not in jail with Chu.

54
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:12,578
You think so?

55
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,829
The doctors said

56
00:08:20,965 --> 00:08:22,489
I only had three months to live.

57
00:08:23,234 --> 00:08:24,997
It's called compassionate release.

58
00:08:25,703 --> 00:08:28,729
Three months can pass quickly, very quickly.

59
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:33,204
My boss will be alive long after you're dead.

60
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,879
Don't you know you're threatening him?

61
00:08:37,114 --> 00:08:39,947
Really? In that case, he can sue me.

62
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,310
Just be careful!

63
00:08:41,452 --> 00:08:42,441
Drive on.

64
00:08:47,157 --> 00:08:48,146
Ka-kui?

65
00:09:15,886 --> 00:09:17,251
Ka-Kui, Chu Tu is out from Jail.

66
00:09:17,555 --> 00:09:18,544
I know, so?

67
00:09:18,856 --> 00:09:19,845
You already knew? That's good then.

68
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,120
As a police
who wouldn't have caught a thief?

69
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:23,348
Who would you be scare of?

70
00:09:23,394 --> 00:09:24,292
Just remember,

71
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:26,523
there are 250,000 Royal HK Police
at your back up.

72
00:09:27,698 --> 00:09:30,360
Bill, are there really 250,000 police in HK?

73
00:09:30,734 --> 00:09:32,031
Just because we
are still recruiting new blood.

74
00:09:32,236 --> 00:09:33,225
Didn't you notice newspaper ad?

75
00:09:34,538 --> 00:09:35,527
What are you waiting for?

76
00:09:35,573 --> 00:09:36,562
Go on patrol!

77
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,675
Hey, I've talked to Raymond.

78
00:09:40,878 --> 00:09:42,004
He said you could carry a gun
even after work.

79
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:51,677
I'm very happy tonight.

80
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:54,182
The show and dinner were great.

81
00:09:54,592 --> 00:09:56,287
But you don't seem very happy.

82
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,484
Really? I am happy.

83
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,023
I wish you had enjoyed it
as much as I did.

84
00:10:04,568 --> 00:10:05,557
Are you worried about Chu?

85
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:07,534
No. But I'm just being careful.

86
00:10:15,713 --> 00:10:16,702
Maybe next week...

87
00:10:16,747 --> 00:10:17,736
Hey, superhero!

88
00:10:19,683 --> 00:10:21,480
Off duty already?

89
00:10:21,652 --> 00:10:22,641
What are you doing here?

90
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,012
I can park here,

91
00:10:24,588 --> 00:10:27,079
you can't give me a ticket.

92
00:10:27,658 --> 00:10:30,525
Yeah, you must have a nice view

93
00:10:30,794 --> 00:10:31,783
from flat B of the first floor.
Am I right?

94
00:10:32,663 --> 00:10:33,652
Go upstairs.

95
00:10:38,168 --> 00:10:39,157
How did you find this address?

96
00:10:40,704 --> 00:10:42,467
It's amazing what information

97
00:10:43,073 --> 00:10:45,234
you can get with money.

98
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:49,478
People will do anything for money,
you know?

99
00:10:50,114 --> 00:10:51,138
What do you mean?

100
00:10:51,315 --> 00:10:53,613
There's a narrow stairwell in the building.

101
00:10:53,951 --> 00:10:57,318
If there was a fire, it'd spread

102
00:10:57,488 --> 00:10:59,183
rapidly through the building.

103
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,054
Because of the narrow access,

104
00:11:02,326 --> 00:11:04,521
the fire brigade couldn't get in here.

105
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:06,286
Therefore, you'd better

106
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,963
keep a close eye on her.

107
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:10,765
If she were to get her pretty ass burnt,

108
00:11:10,934 --> 00:11:14,233
it'd ruin her marriage prospects.

109
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:15,394
Bastard!

110
00:11:25,582 --> 00:11:28,244
Oh, hero, I'm so happy!

111
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,049
Sorry.

112
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:39,090
It's my fault really.

113
00:11:39,563 --> 00:11:41,531
A police like me have lots of enemies
and you are threatened.

114
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:43,591
I'm not scared.

115
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:45,831
If you don't have any enemies,

116
00:11:46,136 --> 00:11:48,536
that means you couldn't catch a thief.

117
00:11:49,673 --> 00:11:50,867
Could you rehouse yourself for a while?

118
00:11:51,575 --> 00:11:52,906
Don't worry about me.

119
00:11:53,077 --> 00:11:54,567
They are just morons.

120
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:56,573
No. We could be noticed
so easily while they won't

121
00:11:57,514 --> 00:11:58,503
This way then,

122
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:00,847
I'll move to my aunt's and hide for a while.

123
00:12:01,452 --> 00:12:02,441
Don't think about it too much.

124
00:12:03,053 --> 00:12:06,318
But, if you threw a vase onto him
then I'll be dead definitely.

125
00:12:22,172 --> 00:12:23,161
May.

126
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:25,297
Auntie.

127
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:27,570
You're on your own?
Where's Ka-kui?

128
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:29,006
He's still on duty.

129
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:30,645
It's OK, I can manage.

130
00:12:30,981 --> 00:12:33,245
I'm not against you dating a policeman,

131
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,008
but I don't want him to spend
too much time on his work.

132
00:12:37,454 --> 00:12:38,443
He's stubborn, too.

133
00:12:38,489 --> 00:12:40,013
But he's a good policeman.

134
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:42,283
That's why he has lots of enemies

135
00:12:42,493 --> 00:12:44,484
and you have to move home.

136
00:12:44,695 --> 00:12:46,094
I have to be careful.

137
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:48,354
That way, he doesn't need to worry about me.

138
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:51,696
He ought to worry about you.

139
00:12:52,536 --> 00:12:53,525
Who are they?

140
00:12:53,737 --> 00:12:54,726
It was them last time.

141
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:56,836
I guess superhero isn't here.

142
00:12:58,442 --> 00:12:59,704
Wait for me in the restaurant.

143
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,099
Right.

144
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:03,875
What do you want?
We have a score to settle.

145
00:13:04,114 --> 00:13:05,411
I just want to know

146
00:13:05,682 --> 00:13:07,309
where you're going.

147
00:13:07,484 --> 00:13:08,473
It's nothing to do with her.

148
00:13:09,853 --> 00:13:13,345
You must be her mother. Am I right?

149
00:13:14,024 --> 00:13:15,013
Bastard!

150
00:13:15,058 --> 00:13:16,992
You call me a bastard?

151
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:20,958
Yes! I'm the bastard son of a bastard!

152
00:13:21,331 --> 00:13:22,320
I'm not afraid of you.

153
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:23,355
Come on.

154
00:13:23,934 --> 00:13:28,200
Auntie, why has your daughter
fallen for a cop?

155
00:13:28,438 --> 00:13:29,666
That could be dangerous.

156
00:13:29,907 --> 00:13:32,535
Living on the 19th floor
is dangerous, too.

157
00:13:32,776 --> 00:13:37,213
What if you fall when
you're cleaning the windows?

158
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:39,304
Go ahead!

159
00:13:41,952 --> 00:13:42,941
Don't be silly.

160
00:13:44,855 --> 00:13:46,379
Go away.

161
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:47,879
Off!

162
00:13:47,925 --> 00:13:49,153
You bastard.

163
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:50,482
Don't grab my hair.

164
00:13:50,894 --> 00:13:52,225
You're hurting me.

165
00:13:52,496 --> 00:13:53,588
You bitch.

166
00:13:57,935 --> 00:13:59,527
Easy, she's just a girl.

167
00:13:59,837 --> 00:14:01,634
Think yourself lucky.
If you were a man, you'd be dead.

168
00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:02,928
I won't forget this.

169
00:14:02,973 --> 00:14:04,440
Come on.

170
00:14:04,608 --> 00:14:05,802
You be careful!

171
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:08,300
Are you ok?

172
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:18,977
Auntie!

173
00:14:19,022 --> 00:14:21,286
It's your job that brings the enemies here.

174
00:14:21,692 --> 00:14:22,886
Look, May was badly beaten because of you!

175
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:25,058
I've told you not to be with him.

176
00:14:27,264 --> 00:14:28,322
Did John Ko attack you?

177
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:31,097
I started hitting him first.

178
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:33,636
He just hit me back.

179
00:14:33,804 --> 00:14:35,328
And they knocked me down.

180
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:39,072
My backside still hurts.
I can't sit down now.

181
00:14:39,243 --> 00:14:40,267
How did they know you'd be here?

182
00:14:41,044 --> 00:14:42,375
They followed her.

183
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:43,978
That's how.

184
00:14:44,248 --> 00:14:46,409
They're watching us from across the street.

185
00:14:47,851 --> 00:14:49,113
I wonder what's next.

186
00:14:50,554 --> 00:14:51,816
Ka-kui, don't!

187
00:14:52,155 --> 00:14:54,453
He should go and scold them.

188
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,084
If it's that simple,

189
00:14:56,627 --> 00:14:58,185
then I'll be relieved.

190
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,078
Idiot! Are you crazy?

191
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:43,731
What would you do beside bullying women?

192
00:15:44,341 --> 00:15:47,242
It's my favourite hobby.

193
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:12,490
Get the bastard!

194
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:28,003
You know the law, don't you?!

195
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:29,234
If they did threaten her,

196
00:17:29,346 --> 00:17:30,335
you could arrest them.

197
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,808
I don't care.

198
00:17:32,449 --> 00:17:33,541
I got carried away.

199
00:17:34,017 --> 00:17:35,382
That's not a good reason.

200
00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:38,217
He reacted like anyone else would.

201
00:17:38,455 --> 00:17:40,616
He's not anyone else.
He's a police officer.

202
00:17:40,924 --> 00:17:42,221
What you've done is disgraceful!

203
00:17:42,426 --> 00:17:43,415
It has disgraced us the police.

204
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,427
I don't think so.

205
00:17:44,461 --> 00:17:45,450
If a policeman fails to respond to

206
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:46,618
a personal threat,

207
00:17:46,763 --> 00:17:48,731
it's disgracefu.
And it disgraces the law, too.

208
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:50,399
You're a show-off.

209
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,589
So we won't forget you arrested Chu.

210
00:17:51,868 --> 00:17:54,769
How can I explain this to the chief!

211
00:17:56,073 --> 00:17:57,973
You don't have to. I quit.

212
00:18:07,617 --> 00:18:09,585
You think that
will resolve the problem?

213
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,114
Why not?
This is probably the best solution.

214
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:15,780
I'll leave now.

215
00:18:17,094 --> 00:18:20,359
Thank you for your support in the past.
Goodbye.

216
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:24,622
Ka-kui.

217
00:18:27,137 --> 00:18:28,126
If that's your last word,

218
00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:32,267
then try to find a less stressful job.
Bye-bye.

219
00:18:33,543 --> 00:18:34,737
I will.

220
00:18:36,046 --> 00:18:38,276
You think you can do anything
because you're cops.

221
00:18:38,548 --> 00:18:39,537
Don't you know the law?!

222
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:42,777
You can't beat me up just like that.
Kill me if you can.

223
00:18:43,086 --> 00:18:44,781
Shut up and sign this.

224
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:47,249
I'm not signing anything.
No way!

225
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:50,524
I'll sue you for every penny
you've got.

226
00:18:50,794 --> 00:18:53,786
I've got lots of money.
I'll get a lawyer. I'll sue you!

227
00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:00,458
What?!

228
00:19:01,138 --> 00:19:02,127
No!

229
00:19:02,172 --> 00:19:05,300
See? You saw this officer
try to assault me.

230
00:19:05,575 --> 00:19:06,803
He wants to beat me up like before

231
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,169
when he hit me and broke my glasses.

232
00:19:09,412 --> 00:19:11,346
You'll pay for that.

233
00:19:11,648 --> 00:19:13,513
You would dare to beat me up here?

234
00:19:14,017 --> 00:19:16,747
Come on. What are you waiting for?!

235
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,581
Come on. I'm going to sue you,
you're going to jail.

236
00:19:31,668 --> 00:19:33,465
These youngsters have no patience.

237
00:19:33,637 --> 00:19:35,901
Bill, why didn't you ask him to stay?

238
00:19:36,373 --> 00:19:37,362
You should have said so!

239
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,964
I thought you meant
throw him out of here.

240
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:44,875
Now I know what this gesture means,
I'll remember it.

241
00:19:50,353 --> 00:19:51,718
Ka-kui, what's the matter?

242
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:54,479
You don't want me to be a policeman, do you?

243
00:19:56,326 --> 00:19:59,261
Of course I do, I'm proud of you.

244
00:19:59,863 --> 00:20:01,296
What do I have after being a cop

245
00:20:01,731 --> 00:20:03,358
for such a long time? Just enemies.

246
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:06,830
There you go!
That means you've done your job well.

247
00:20:07,037 --> 00:20:08,732
If a cop has no enemies,
there is only one reason:

248
00:20:08,939 --> 00:20:09,928
He hasn't caught any crooks.

249
00:20:10,507 --> 00:20:12,600
I'm glad they hate you!

250
00:20:12,876 --> 00:20:14,867
It proves that you're a tough good cop.

251
00:20:15,412 --> 00:20:16,401
Thanks for that.

252
00:20:18,448 --> 00:20:19,938
But I've had enough.

253
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,810
I resigned today.

254
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:22,840
Really?

255
00:20:22,886 --> 00:20:23,818
Are you disappointed?

256
00:20:23,853 --> 00:20:24,842
You're really quitting?!

257
00:20:26,556 --> 00:20:28,717
I'm so happy!

258
00:20:29,426 --> 00:20:30,415
Calm down.

259
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:32,318
What's she doing?!

260
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,494
May, for these years,
I haven't treat you as good as I should.

261
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:40,658
It's my fault.

262
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:41,793
I have three months' holidays.

263
00:20:42,305 --> 00:20:43,397
Let's go somewhere else to relax!

264
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:45,464
Ka-kui, you mean it?

265
00:20:46,243 --> 00:20:48,108
Where to go then? Bali.

266
00:20:48,144 --> 00:20:49,133
Good idea!

267
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,013
We haven't travel for years.

268
00:20:52,382 --> 00:20:54,077
Right, so let's go.

269
00:20:54,918 --> 00:20:57,580
It feels good to fly on the plane.

270
00:21:03,093 --> 00:21:04,355
That's $5,540, please.

271
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:05,483
Right.

272
00:21:08,198 --> 00:21:09,187
I'll see you outside.

273
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:11,932
Credit card?
Sure.

274
00:21:17,874 --> 00:21:19,637
Here's our catalogue, sir.

275
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:21,137
Thank you. Bye.

276
00:21:28,618 --> 00:21:30,142
What clothes should I take?

277
00:21:30,287 --> 00:21:31,914
You won't need any in Bali.

278
00:21:32,122 --> 00:21:33,111
Don't be silly!

279
00:21:33,823 --> 00:21:35,757
I can't believe we're going.

280
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:37,256
I just hope they won't rip us off.

281
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:39,185
No, they're a big company.

282
00:21:39,396 --> 00:21:40,385
It's trustworthy.

283
00:21:40,463 --> 00:21:41,987
It's paid for now.

284
00:21:42,332 --> 00:21:43,526
Let's cross our fingers.

285
00:21:44,668 --> 00:21:46,659
Fey!
Ka-kui.

286
00:21:46,703 --> 00:21:47,692
Is this your area?

287
00:21:47,737 --> 00:21:48,897
Yes.
What's up?

288
00:21:48,938 --> 00:21:50,906
We've received a bomb threat
in here.

289
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,030
Really?

290
00:21:52,075 --> 00:21:54,202
Yeah. Can you help us out?

291
00:21:56,846 --> 00:21:57,835
All right, then. Thanks.

292
00:21:58,315 --> 00:21:59,304
Ka-kui!

293
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,681
I'll just take a look, all right?

294
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:03,908
Sun.

295
00:22:04,354 --> 00:22:05,343
Just in time. What's up?

296
00:22:05,588 --> 00:22:07,419
We got a call about a bomb.

297
00:22:07,657 --> 00:22:08,749
Are you sure it's real?

298
00:22:09,726 --> 00:22:12,593
I don't think he was kidding.
He told us to clear the area.

299
00:22:12,796 --> 00:22:14,093
We have ten minutes.

300
00:22:14,497 --> 00:22:15,486
Really?

301
00:22:15,532 --> 00:22:17,659
The manager said he's nuts.

302
00:22:18,001 --> 00:22:20,970
Start clearing the building now.

303
00:22:21,738 --> 00:22:23,569
There are too many people.

304
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,708
If it's a hoax, who'll be to blame?

305
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:27,671
I'm used to getting an earful.

306
00:22:27,877 --> 00:22:30,141
If it is real, we'll endanger lives.

307
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,974
That's true.
What do we do?

308
00:22:32,515 --> 00:22:35,678
Consider it real. Clear the building.
Call headquarters.

309
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:37,308
Where's the fire alarm?

310
00:22:38,355 --> 00:22:39,344
Over there.

311
00:22:39,622 --> 00:22:40,611
Ka-kui.

312
00:22:41,491 --> 00:22:43,220
We'll go set off the fire alarm. Come on.

313
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:50,896
Your truncheon. But...

314
00:22:51,034 --> 00:22:52,023
Come on, I'll bear the consquence.

315
00:22:56,106 --> 00:22:57,095
Follow me.

316
00:23:10,186 --> 00:23:11,380
Don't panic. Don't worry.

317
00:23:11,654 --> 00:23:14,384
Come back. I've opened the till already.

318
00:23:15,492 --> 00:23:16,481
Have they paid?

319
00:23:17,327 --> 00:23:19,261
What's going on?

320
00:23:24,534 --> 00:23:25,523
It's nothing.

321
00:23:25,568 --> 00:23:28,128
What should we do?
They're not taking any notice.

322
00:23:28,304 --> 00:23:29,293
Ka-kui.

323
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:34,074
Don't stay here. Go on!

324
00:23:34,411 --> 00:23:37,244
Your attention please,
evacuate the building.

325
00:23:37,514 --> 00:23:40,779
Everybody please leave immediately.

326
00:23:41,017 --> 00:23:42,951
There's a fire in the building.

327
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:44,878
Please leave now.

328
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,652
Please leave in an orderly manner.

329
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:51,523
Everybody outside.

330
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:52,950
Be careful.

331
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:02,433
What's going on? Why the alarm's on?

332
00:24:03,373 --> 00:24:04,397
How about our business?

333
00:24:05,842 --> 00:24:07,639
Fay.
What's up?

334
00:24:07,677 --> 00:24:09,736
Get them out of here.

335
00:24:11,548 --> 00:24:14,176
This is for your own safety. Go now!

336
00:24:14,484 --> 00:24:15,974
What about you?

337
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,377
I won't be long. You go first.

338
00:24:21,391 --> 00:24:22,449
Check the building.

339
00:24:39,108 --> 00:24:41,542
I can't understand this. It's crazy!

340
00:24:47,383 --> 00:24:48,372
Who's in charge?

341
00:24:48,518 --> 00:24:49,507
You talk to them.

342
00:24:50,453 --> 00:24:53,445
Please leave here now,
the police will take care of it.

343
00:24:54,257 --> 00:24:55,815
Ka-kui. Ka-kui!

344
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:58,120
I'm all right. You go home first.

345
00:25:04,501 --> 00:25:05,490
Hello, sir.

346
00:25:05,768 --> 00:25:06,757
Who made the call?

347
00:25:06,936 --> 00:25:08,767
We received a call

348
00:25:09,005 --> 00:25:10,302
but we didn't know if it was a hoax.

349
00:25:11,574 --> 00:25:12,563
Who set off the alarm?

350
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,299
It was me, sir.

351
00:25:16,846 --> 00:25:17,835
You may leave.

352
00:25:23,386 --> 00:25:24,614
Why did you do it?

353
00:25:25,021 --> 00:25:26,682
Sir, when I was in the Police Academy,

354
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:27,879
I was taught that

355
00:25:28,091 --> 00:25:30,559
public safety comes first.

356
00:25:30,793 --> 00:25:31,782
So I set off the alarm.

357
00:25:31,928 --> 00:25:33,623
Do you think
you're indispensable?

358
00:25:35,565 --> 00:25:38,864
Superintendent. There's no fire.

359
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:41,669
But it was your men
who cleared the building.

360
00:25:41,905 --> 00:25:44,396
Right. The Bomb Disposal Unit are coming.

361
00:25:44,641 --> 00:25:45,869
You won't be needed now.

362
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:48,236
Right. I hope this isn't a hoax.

363
00:25:48,645 --> 00:25:49,737
Uncle Bill. So do I.

364
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,471
Raymond. They want to see
the head man.

365
00:25:52,649 --> 00:25:54,048
Shall I go?

366
00:25:55,184 --> 00:25:57,345
Where's the Bomb Disposal Unit?
On their way.

367
00:26:01,324 --> 00:26:02,313
What a mess.

368
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:03,482
Did I do the right thing?

369
00:26:04,227 --> 00:26:05,819
How do I do know? Don't ask me.

370
00:26:06,796 --> 00:26:07,990
Right now,

371
00:26:08,932 --> 00:26:10,923
we have to wait and see.

372
00:26:11,067 --> 00:26:12,056
Tell them to leave.

373
00:26:13,002 --> 00:26:14,230
You can go back in very soon.

374
00:26:15,138 --> 00:26:16,435
My ball!

375
00:26:40,363 --> 00:26:41,352
When can we go back in?

376
00:26:41,664 --> 00:26:42,653
Now what?

377
00:26:42,699 --> 00:26:43,461
Very soon.

378
00:26:43,499 --> 00:26:44,431
Here's your ball.

379
00:26:44,467 --> 00:26:45,456
Thank you.

380
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:53,164
Ready?

381
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:54,403
The Bomb Disposal Unit are here.

382
00:26:55,345 --> 00:26:57,074
If they don't find anything,

383
00:26:58,481 --> 00:26:59,470
the boss will blow a fuse.

384
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:01,539
Uncle Bill, I'm very sorry.

385
00:27:01,784 --> 00:27:03,479
I'm not...

386
00:27:17,266 --> 00:27:18,255
Red alert!

387
00:27:18,301 --> 00:27:19,290
All units move in.

388
00:27:20,003 --> 00:27:21,470
Go and fight the fire. Go on.

389
00:27:32,749 --> 00:27:35,513
I suppose the good news is
nobody got hurt.

390
00:27:35,685 --> 00:27:36,674
What are the losses?

391
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,812
The insurance will cover it.

392
00:27:39,088 --> 00:27:41,682
I'm more worried about
the damage to our image.

393
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:44,252
I've asked the press to cooperate
and I'm sure they will.

394
00:27:46,062 --> 00:27:48,530
But who did it and why our company?

395
00:27:49,165 --> 00:27:50,257
It may not be against us.

396
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,295
It could be someone
who's mentally disturbed.

397
00:27:56,406 --> 00:27:57,600
There's a man on the line, sir.

398
00:27:57,874 --> 00:27:59,273
He says he planted the bomb.

399
00:27:59,842 --> 00:28:00,831
Have it put through.

400
00:28:02,211 --> 00:28:03,200
Put him through.

401
00:28:04,147 --> 00:28:05,136
Hello? Hold on.

402
00:28:05,948 --> 00:28:08,280
Listen, we planted the bomb
in your shopping centre.

403
00:28:08,818 --> 00:28:11,116
We want $10 million.

404
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,618
Pay up or your...
other properties will get bombed.

405
00:28:14,123 --> 00:28:15,112
Let me talk to him.

406
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:17,222
All right.

407
00:28:17,827 --> 00:28:19,021
But it's a huge amount of money.

408
00:28:19,595 --> 00:28:21,392
We'll need to call a board meeting.

409
00:28:21,597 --> 00:28:22,859
You've got 24 hours.

410
00:28:23,266 --> 00:28:24,324
Don't call the police.

411
00:28:26,469 --> 00:28:27,458
What to do then?

412
00:28:27,637 --> 00:28:29,867
Must be some hoax.

413
00:28:30,273 --> 00:28:31,262
Yes.

414
00:28:31,374 --> 00:28:32,671
So what do we do?

415
00:28:32,842 --> 00:28:33,831
Call the police.

416
00:28:34,043 --> 00:28:35,032
We pay so much tax.

417
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:36,575
The police should do something for us.

418
00:28:38,047 --> 00:28:39,071
Call the head for me.

419
00:28:39,148 --> 00:28:40,137
Yes.

420
00:28:40,183 --> 00:28:42,048
Raymond, you were extremely lucky.

421
00:28:42,318 --> 00:28:45,583
It's amazing that no one
was hurt in the explosion.

422
00:28:45,855 --> 00:28:47,220
Thank God for that.

423
00:28:48,658 --> 00:28:50,523
And the Chu case, well done!

424
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,523
Thank you. But it wasn't just me.

425
00:28:53,196 --> 00:28:54,185
That's right.

426
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,424
You've proved yourself.

427
00:28:55,698 --> 00:28:58,599
You should handle this case. Do you agree?

428
00:28:59,869 --> 00:29:01,200
Sure. Of course.

429
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:03,828
Bill.

430
00:29:04,741 --> 00:29:06,299
This is a very tough case.

431
00:29:06,676 --> 00:29:08,371
That's why they gave it to us.

432
00:29:08,945 --> 00:29:11,743
In our department,
who do you think can solve it?

433
00:29:12,815 --> 00:29:14,077
You're the only one.

434
00:29:14,517 --> 00:29:15,506
I want a better idea.

435
00:29:16,285 --> 00:29:17,616
And it's definitely not me.

436
00:29:18,554 --> 00:29:21,523
Maybe we could bring back
somebody who's on leave.

437
00:29:22,892 --> 00:29:23,984
Do you mean somebody like Ka-kui?

438
00:29:24,594 --> 00:29:25,583
He has good experience.

439
00:29:25,795 --> 00:29:29,231
I don't know.
He's unorthodox, impulsive.

440
00:29:29,565 --> 00:29:31,556
He'll only give us trouble.
We have to bear the consquence

441
00:29:31,834 --> 00:29:34,803
I agree he's a little bit rash,
but underneath he's a good cop.

442
00:29:35,772 --> 00:29:36,761
I won't let him do it.

443
00:29:36,906 --> 00:29:39,272
But if you think he's our man,
you go find him.

444
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,542
Let's see who's the boss.

445
00:29:59,629 --> 00:30:00,618
Over there.

446
00:30:00,663 --> 00:30:01,652
Here?

447
00:30:10,573 --> 00:30:11,562
Fasten your seat belt please.

448
00:30:12,642 --> 00:30:14,132
I forgot the sun screen...

449
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,470
Buy it when we get there.

450
00:30:18,014 --> 00:30:19,481
Did you get your passport?
When you were young?

451
00:30:20,483 --> 00:30:23,008
Put out a call
for Detective Chan Ka-kui.

452
00:30:23,186 --> 00:30:24,175
Sure.

453
00:30:25,855 --> 00:30:27,015
Attention please.

454
00:30:27,423 --> 00:30:28,856
Will Chan Ka-kui...

455
00:30:28,891 --> 00:30:30,415
Let me see.
No, don't look!

456
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:32,324
It's cute.
It's horrible.

457
00:30:32,762 --> 00:30:34,730
...Ka-kui please contact us.

458
00:30:34,764 --> 00:30:35,731
That's you. Yeah.

459
00:30:35,765 --> 00:30:37,357
What's up?
I don't know.

460
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,526
I won't be long.

461
00:30:41,737 --> 00:30:43,329
Are you Mr Chan?
Yeah.

462
00:30:43,372 --> 00:30:45,533
I'm afraid there seems to be

463
00:30:45,741 --> 00:30:46,833
a problem with your passport.

464
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,399
Really?

465
00:30:48,611 --> 00:30:49,805
It'll just be a quick check.

466
00:30:51,881 --> 00:30:52,870
What's going on?

467
00:30:54,116 --> 00:30:55,606
I'll be back right away.

468
00:30:56,252 --> 00:30:57,241
Hurry!

469
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,509
OK

470
00:31:00,089 --> 00:31:01,078
Bye-bye.

471
00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:14,758
What do you want?

472
00:31:15,438 --> 00:31:17,303
Thank you.
You're welcome.

473
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,432
What is it? I have a plane waiting.

474
00:31:19,408 --> 00:31:20,534
We have a problem.

475
00:31:20,877 --> 00:31:24,438
It seems that the bombing case
has become a blackmail case.

476
00:31:24,814 --> 00:31:26,247
And it's a very tough one.

477
00:31:26,282 --> 00:31:27,214
So?

478
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,013
This case is a real challenge.

479
00:31:29,318 --> 00:31:30,307
Raymond was hoping...

480
00:31:31,654 --> 00:31:33,918
I was hoping that you might
cancel your holiday.

481
00:31:34,957 --> 00:31:36,822
No! I've already boarded the plane.

482
00:31:37,526 --> 00:31:38,686
And I've quit.

483
00:31:38,861 --> 00:31:39,850
I know how you feel.

484
00:31:40,329 --> 00:31:42,126
You've been under pressure lately.

485
00:31:42,531 --> 00:31:43,623
But ducking out like this?

486
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,989
I'm not ducking out.

487
00:31:45,468 --> 00:31:46,992
He said he's not ducking out!

488
00:31:49,605 --> 00:31:52,699
Raymond is a great admirer of your abilities.

489
00:31:54,343 --> 00:31:56,811
I don't have any abilities.
I'm too impulsive.

490
00:31:57,346 --> 00:31:59,644
Impulsive? More a man of action.

491
00:32:00,249 --> 00:32:02,274
If only I could control my actions.

492
00:32:02,551 --> 00:32:05,042
A true man of action
is one who acts upon instinct.

493
00:32:06,022 --> 00:32:08,252
I think the police force

494
00:32:08,424 --> 00:32:09,413
needs men with discipline.

495
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:11,458
Instinctive men have to be unconventional,

496
00:32:11,894 --> 00:32:13,691
even at the cost of discipline.

497
00:32:14,063 --> 00:32:17,794
If you did everything by the book,
no cases would be solved. Am I right?

498
00:32:18,334 --> 00:32:19,323
Absolutely.

499
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,059
I'd better get back on board.

500
00:32:24,507 --> 00:32:25,496
You're right.

501
00:32:26,242 --> 00:32:27,231
Goodbye.

502
00:32:32,048 --> 00:32:33,037
How much is the ransom?

503
00:32:33,115 --> 00:32:35,413
Ten million. That's all we know.

504
00:32:35,685 --> 00:32:36,674
Do we have any suspects?

505
00:32:37,153 --> 00:32:38,142
Not a clue.

506
00:32:38,888 --> 00:32:40,947
Do you think these people are insane?

507
00:32:41,524 --> 00:32:43,253
Why are you asking me? I don't know.

508
00:32:44,827 --> 00:32:46,692
Have you traced the dynamite?

509
00:32:46,862 --> 00:32:48,227
Why?

510
00:32:48,497 --> 00:32:49,486
Yes. Why?

511
00:32:49,532 --> 00:32:50,521
Simple.

512
00:32:50,566 --> 00:32:53,000
Dynamite is a controlled substance.

513
00:32:53,235 --> 00:32:55,795
So you either smuggle it in

514
00:32:56,072 --> 00:32:57,562
or steal it from a local company.

515
00:32:58,074 --> 00:33:00,406
He's right. We'd not thought of that.

516
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:01,902
We must find their bomb factory

517
00:33:02,178 --> 00:33:04,612
before the company pays the ransom.

518
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,848
If we do that, we can foil their plans.

519
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:09,884
Why can you always solve problems
so easily?

520
00:33:10,186 --> 00:33:11,710
You're the one
who's made for this case.

521
00:33:11,887 --> 00:33:13,149
You're in charge.

522
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:17,114
I've got a plane to catch.

523
00:33:18,494 --> 00:33:21,122
Wait! Ka-kui.

524
00:33:21,263 --> 00:33:22,252
You can go there any time.

525
00:33:22,298 --> 00:33:24,323
This case is a one-off.

526
00:33:24,934 --> 00:33:25,923
Go there next time. OK?

527
00:33:28,137 --> 00:33:29,399
I'd better talk to May first.

528
00:33:29,772 --> 00:33:30,761
Hurry up, then.

529
00:33:36,245 --> 00:33:37,234
Hurry up.

530
00:33:38,247 --> 00:33:39,874
Miss!
Yes, sir?

531
00:33:39,915 --> 00:33:41,576
My plane...
It just took off.

532
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,609
It's taken off!

533
00:33:46,322 --> 00:33:48,153
You've missed your flight!

534
00:33:48,357 --> 00:33:50,120
Trust them to be on schedule.

535
00:33:51,293 --> 00:33:53,090
I still have May's passport.

536
00:33:53,396 --> 00:33:56,524
Damn! It sure isn't your lucky day!

537
00:33:59,035 --> 00:34:00,024
Now what?

538
00:34:10,246 --> 00:34:11,338
Uncle Bill, we better go.

539
00:34:13,582 --> 00:34:14,571
All right?

540
00:34:14,617 --> 00:34:15,606
I ate something bad.

541
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,809
That way, sir.

542
00:34:18,854 --> 00:34:19,843
Thank you.

543
00:34:20,222 --> 00:34:23,658
Excuse me. We're police officers.
We're here to see Miss Wong.

544
00:34:23,993 --> 00:34:24,982
30th floor.

545
00:34:25,194 --> 00:34:26,183
Thank you.

546
00:34:28,764 --> 00:34:29,753
Bugging devices.

547
00:34:30,132 --> 00:34:31,292
Bugging?

548
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:33,294
Be careful, Nixon lost his job
because of one of these.

549
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:34,458
If we are to solve the case,

550
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:37,930
we have to know our targets well.
We're counting on you.

551
00:34:38,774 --> 00:34:39,763
Put them away.

552
00:34:42,178 --> 00:34:44,544
Miss Wong,
there are two police officers here.

553
00:34:44,747 --> 00:34:45,736
Where's the loo?

554
00:34:46,215 --> 00:34:47,204
On your right.

555
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:48,405
Thanks.

556
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,909
25 please.

557
00:34:53,756 --> 00:34:54,745
24 please.

558
00:34:56,926 --> 00:34:57,915
Wait!

559
00:34:59,462 --> 00:35:02,295
Uncle Bill, I'm really worried about May.

560
00:35:03,065 --> 00:35:05,590
I'll call Jakarta airport
as soon as I get to the office.

561
00:35:15,144 --> 00:35:17,977
Uncle Bill.

562
00:35:28,524 --> 00:35:31,391
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Haven't you got any manners?

563
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:38,394
Let's use the other elevators.

564
00:35:51,614 --> 00:35:53,639
Detective Chan
to see Miss Wong.

565
00:35:53,782 --> 00:35:54,771
If you'll please wait.

566
00:35:54,817 --> 00:35:55,806
Thank you.

567
00:36:00,189 --> 00:36:01,178
Ka-Kui

568
00:36:01,257 --> 00:36:02,246
Uncle Bill

569
00:36:03,993 --> 00:36:06,427
I thought you were used to taking the blame.

570
00:36:06,962 --> 00:36:08,429
That's no excuse!

571
00:36:08,697 --> 00:36:09,686
Gentlemen.

572
00:36:10,299 --> 00:36:11,732
I'm Detective Chang, this is Detective Chan.

573
00:36:11,867 --> 00:36:12,856
We...

574
00:36:12,902 --> 00:36:14,392
Please come with me.

575
00:36:14,436 --> 00:36:16,563
We're...
I know. Mr Fung is busy now

576
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:18,807
but he's signed the papers.

577
00:36:25,848 --> 00:36:26,837
Excuse me.

578
00:36:32,721 --> 00:36:33,847
Excuse me, where's the toilet?

579
00:36:34,023 --> 00:36:35,012
Down the corridor.

580
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:36,947
Here, sir.

581
00:36:37,593 --> 00:36:38,582
I'm so sorry.

582
00:36:41,497 --> 00:36:43,556
It's OK. Where's your friend?

583
00:36:44,066 --> 00:36:45,294
He had a sudden urge.

584
00:37:01,217 --> 00:37:02,206
There's the chairman.

585
00:37:03,018 --> 00:37:04,508
That site is worth three billion.
There would be a profit.

586
00:37:04,553 --> 00:37:06,350
Chairman,
Yes?

587
00:37:06,388 --> 00:37:08,185
Detective Chan is here.
Thank you.

588
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,213
Thanks for all your help.

589
00:37:13,796 --> 00:37:15,161
You're developing the new estates very fast.

590
00:37:27,343 --> 00:37:28,332
Please sit.

591
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,545
Welcome to all directors,
managers and heads.

592
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,917
I've called this meeting
to review the performance

593
00:37:38,053 --> 00:37:40,112
of our property portfolio

594
00:37:40,522 --> 00:37:43,082
and to set the sales target
for the next year.

595
00:37:43,759 --> 00:37:45,192
You may all know that

596
00:37:45,394 --> 00:37:46,918
since the collapse of

597
00:37:47,229 --> 00:37:49,254
the stock market last year,

598
00:37:49,565 --> 00:37:53,057
the Hang Seng Index has risen 66%.

599
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:55,894
Let me show you the performance

600
00:37:56,071 --> 00:37:57,504
of the major blue chip shares.

601
00:38:19,962 --> 00:38:23,056
However, by the performance of
the bank and property sectors,

602
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,124
the outlook of the stock market for

603
00:38:26,302 --> 00:38:28,600
the next half year remains uncertain.

604
00:38:29,271 --> 00:38:30,568
In situations like this,

605
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:35,776
small investors are likely
to put their money in property.

606
00:38:49,758 --> 00:38:51,385
So we have to accelerate the pace of

607
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,184
developing our new housing estates.

608
00:38:58,534 --> 00:38:59,523
Hi, you're gorgeous.

609
00:39:10,379 --> 00:39:12,370
If someone asks the chairman

610
00:39:12,581 --> 00:39:13,605
for this, it's $500 to get it back.

611
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:15,072
Really?

612
00:39:15,117 --> 00:39:16,106
Yeah. Bye-bye.

613
00:39:17,286 --> 00:39:18,275
What happened?

614
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,446
It's a meeting.

615
00:39:19,688 --> 00:39:20,985
Did you plant the bugs?

616
00:39:21,156 --> 00:39:22,919
Sure.
And the desk?

617
00:39:22,958 --> 00:39:24,823
All done.
Was it easy?

618
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:25,849
He wasn't against it!

619
00:39:29,298 --> 00:39:30,287
What was said?

620
00:39:30,332 --> 00:39:31,321
Something about houses.

621
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:32,422
Really?

622
00:39:32,468 --> 00:39:34,368
Where are you going?
I'll take the next one.

623
00:39:58,427 --> 00:39:59,416
May's here.

624
00:40:05,334 --> 00:40:06,323
May, you're back!

625
00:40:07,236 --> 00:40:08,225
May.

626
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:09,726
You scumbag!

627
00:40:10,339 --> 00:40:11,328
Let me explain.

628
00:40:13,475 --> 00:40:15,306
You...
You didn't want me to come back!

629
00:40:15,644 --> 00:40:17,703
You left me there

630
00:40:17,946 --> 00:40:19,106
and took my passport!

631
00:40:19,348 --> 00:40:21,816
When I got there, I couldn't do anything.

632
00:40:22,117 --> 00:40:23,880
Before I was sent back here,

633
00:40:24,153 --> 00:40:26,883
they detained me for ten hours in a cell!

634
00:40:27,189 --> 00:40:29,123
Why should I keep my voice down?

635
00:40:29,591 --> 00:40:32,355
When you take your dog for a walk,

636
00:40:32,661 --> 00:40:35,027
do you not take him home afterwards?

637
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,595
I'm even worse than a dog.

638
00:40:36,899 --> 00:40:38,389
May, they're watching us.

639
00:40:38,567 --> 00:40:40,967
What are you staring at?

640
00:40:41,303 --> 00:40:43,396
It's none of your business!

641
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,171
I want you to tell me
in front of everyone

642
00:40:46,442 --> 00:40:48,103
what you think I am.

643
00:40:48,277 --> 00:40:49,676
What the hell do you take me for?

644
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,573
You're my girlfriend!

645
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:55,477
Your girlfriend?! Open up! Open up!

646
00:41:00,222 --> 00:41:02,190
If that's true,
why treat me that way?

647
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:05,120
You even treat strangers
better than me.

648
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,384
Let me tell you...

649
00:41:08,997 --> 00:41:10,931
it's over between us!

650
00:41:24,446 --> 00:41:27,006
Chan Ka-kui, you bastard!

651
00:41:29,384 --> 00:41:31,318
Uncle Bill, did you make that call?

652
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,754
I needed to go to the toilet.

653
00:41:33,989 --> 00:41:35,081
You've ruined my life.

654
00:41:48,403 --> 00:41:49,392
Wait!

655
00:41:49,438 --> 00:41:51,633
Go away or I'll run you over.

656
00:41:52,241 --> 00:41:53,230
Go away!

657
00:41:53,275 --> 00:41:54,264
Don't be childish!

658
00:41:58,046 --> 00:41:59,638
Don't grab my bag! Go away!

659
00:41:59,882 --> 00:42:02,544
Don't even touch me. Go away.
Leave me alone.

660
00:42:02,718 --> 00:42:03,810
Let me explain.

661
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:05,313
I don't want to know.

662
00:42:06,154 --> 00:42:08,349
I've nothing else to say to you.

663
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:10,481
May!

664
00:42:12,995 --> 00:42:14,223
May, are you all right?

665
00:42:15,931 --> 00:42:18,456
Stay away from me.
Don't touch my motorbike.

666
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,031
Keep away.
I don't want you anywhere near me.

667
00:42:20,168 --> 00:42:21,157
Let me explain.

668
00:42:21,203 --> 00:42:22,192
Keep away.

669
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,874
Why won't you help me?!

670
00:42:29,211 --> 00:42:32,874
Just keep away from me.
I don't want to see you again.

671
00:42:34,516 --> 00:42:35,778
May.

672
00:42:35,984 --> 00:42:38,043
All right, get back to work.
I want to see Ka-kui.

673
00:42:38,353 --> 00:42:40,218
Ka-kui, the boss wants to see you.

674
00:42:54,002 --> 00:42:55,367
I'm sorry, sir.

675
00:42:55,504 --> 00:42:56,493
It's all right.

676
00:42:56,538 --> 00:42:58,165
Do you want to call May to explain?

677
00:42:58,707 --> 00:42:59,935
I don't think it would help.

678
00:43:00,108 --> 00:43:02,508
Don't explain to women!
This is my way to treat my woman.

679
00:43:02,744 --> 00:43:03,938
If a man's not at home,

680
00:43:04,212 --> 00:43:05,338
it's obvious he's working.

681
00:43:06,381 --> 00:43:08,076
Excuse me, I have to go to the toilet.

682
00:43:08,917 --> 00:43:10,612
Don't take any notice of his chauvinism.

683
00:43:10,852 --> 00:43:11,841
Go get changed.

684
00:43:39,848 --> 00:43:44,308
Are you going home, May?

685
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:47,780
It's better than wasting my time here.
Good night.

686
00:43:49,024 --> 00:43:50,150
Can I walk you home?

687
00:43:51,293 --> 00:43:52,282
No thanks.

688
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,667
Don't be foolish.

689
00:43:59,901 --> 00:44:00,925
No, I won't.

690
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:03,135
Get me, it's me you want.

691
00:44:03,338 --> 00:44:04,327
Don't be foolish.

692
00:44:04,373 --> 00:44:06,841
You're in this together.

693
00:44:07,042 --> 00:44:08,031
Don't try anything.

694
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:11,443
Prepare to die!

695
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:19,186
I really had you going! I got the both of you!

696
00:44:21,156 --> 00:44:22,145
Ka-kui!

697
00:44:34,302 --> 00:44:35,291
I've found it.

698
00:44:47,616 --> 00:44:50,084
Looks like you're outnumbered.

699
00:44:50,252 --> 00:44:51,241
If I knew it's merely an easy game

700
00:44:51,386 --> 00:44:54,116
I won't call my men to come.

701
00:44:54,656 --> 00:44:55,645
I'm flattered.

702
00:44:55,991 --> 00:44:59,017
My boss asked me
to teach you a lesson.

703
00:44:59,261 --> 00:45:01,286
I'm paid to do it.

704
00:45:01,496 --> 00:45:02,656
But I don't need to dirty my hands,

705
00:45:02,864 --> 00:45:05,128
my men can take care of you.

706
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,592
Get on with it.

707
00:45:07,035 --> 00:45:08,935
We'll give you a chance.

708
00:45:09,171 --> 00:45:11,332
If you apologise to Mr Ko now,

709
00:45:11,573 --> 00:45:13,336
we won't break both of your legs.

710
00:45:13,542 --> 00:45:15,237
We'll just break one of them.

711
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:18,101
Cut the bullshit. Go on, kill me.

712
00:45:18,447 --> 00:45:20,472
Kill a cop? No, I don't think so.

713
00:45:20,682 --> 00:45:22,172
My boss wants to teach you a lesson.

714
00:45:22,417 --> 00:45:25,352
Ripping a few limbs off should do the trick.

715
00:45:33,128 --> 00:45:34,117
Get him!

716
00:45:36,031 --> 00:45:37,089
Go!

717
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:49,643
There he is. Beat him up!

718
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:57,344
Go on, finish him off.
Get up.

719
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:59,829
Move over. Let me drive.

720
00:48:11,753 --> 00:48:12,879
I'll turn you into mashed banana.

721
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:30,401
It wasn't my fault! I was paid to do it.

722
00:48:54,296 --> 00:48:57,026
Keep away or I'll shoot!

723
00:48:57,065 --> 00:48:57,895
Shoot me!

724
00:48:57,933 --> 00:48:58,729
I'll shoot.

725
00:48:58,767 --> 00:48:59,461
Shoot here!

726
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:00,490
It's not my fault.

727
00:49:06,675 --> 00:49:11,271
It's not. It's not my fault.

728
00:49:11,479 --> 00:49:12,673
Next time I'll kick your ass.

729
00:49:12,914 --> 00:49:15,280
It's not my fault.

730
00:49:23,458 --> 00:49:24,447
May.

731
00:49:24,693 --> 00:49:25,682
May. Did they hurt you?

732
00:49:26,661 --> 00:49:27,650
I'm all right.

733
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:30,720
You'd better be careful.

734
00:49:32,067 --> 00:49:35,730
Why did you chase him? It's dangerous.

735
00:49:36,171 --> 00:49:38,139
I wanted to make things up to you.

736
00:49:38,707 --> 00:49:41,699
If it had been acid in that pistol
and not ink,

737
00:49:43,144 --> 00:49:44,668
I'd have been scarred.

738
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:47,512
Maybe they wanted to distract you
and then kidnap me.

739
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:50,039
Then what would happen?

740
00:49:52,187 --> 00:49:55,623
Ka-kui, I want my boyfriend
to be gentle,

741
00:49:55,991 --> 00:49:59,722
not a savage. Do you understand?

742
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:10,827
Come in.

743
00:50:14,376 --> 00:50:15,365
Good morning.

744
00:50:16,611 --> 00:50:19,978
Police detective in park rumpus.
Who was that?

745
00:50:20,515 --> 00:50:21,504
Look!

746
00:50:24,285 --> 00:50:25,445
I'll check out the surveillance team.

747
00:50:37,499 --> 00:50:38,488
It was me.

748
00:50:42,837 --> 00:50:44,429
I know Chu wants revenge,

749
00:50:45,306 --> 00:50:46,671
but don't take the law into your own hands.

750
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:47,967
Sorry, sir.

751
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:49,799
Anything I can do?

752
00:50:50,145 --> 00:50:52,409
No, thanks.

753
00:50:52,614 --> 00:50:54,343
I can cope with it.
I just want them to leave me alone.

754
00:50:55,517 --> 00:50:57,212
All right. But keep your eyes open.

755
00:50:58,453 --> 00:51:00,353
Now we've got a surveillance team.

756
00:51:00,722 --> 00:51:03,520
They're very good.
Go and talk to them.

757
00:51:12,534 --> 00:51:14,229
Did he give you an earful? Did he...

758
00:51:15,603 --> 00:51:16,592
Let's go over there.

759
00:51:19,741 --> 00:51:20,867
He just want to help.

760
00:51:21,142 --> 00:51:22,973
How to show off if there is no audience?

761
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:39,684
Sir,

762
00:51:40,628 --> 00:51:41,617
let me introduce.

763
00:51:41,663 --> 00:51:42,960
This is Detective Chan Ka-kui;

764
00:51:43,498 --> 00:51:44,522
Detective Ng, Detective Mui.

765
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:46,689
Hello.

766
00:51:46,734 --> 00:51:47,723
You guys intoduce yourselves.

767
00:51:48,203 --> 00:51:49,534
Sum Kin

768
00:51:49,704 --> 00:51:51,672
They are the special tactic unit.

769
00:51:51,973 --> 00:51:52,962
Please take a seat.

770
00:51:53,308 --> 00:51:54,969
They are expertised in following targets.

771
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:58,577
But why?
Will this be useful for the case?

772
00:51:59,114 --> 00:52:01,605
Because we don't even know who did it.

773
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:02,839
That's easy.

774
00:52:03,118 --> 00:52:05,484
Follow anyone suspicious
then you'll know.

775
00:52:05,787 --> 00:52:06,776
Follow the suspects

776
00:52:06,821 --> 00:52:09,289
then we could find the their hiding place
for making bombs.

777
00:52:10,158 --> 00:52:11,147
Just to follow them during the transaction,

778
00:52:11,226 --> 00:52:13,285
then we could arrest them.

779
00:52:13,561 --> 00:52:14,550
That simple?

780
00:52:14,596 --> 00:52:15,358
Of course.

781
00:52:15,396 --> 00:52:17,421
Good, that's why I always have faith on you.

782
00:52:17,932 --> 00:52:19,160
Hope you have a smooth cooperation.

783
00:52:19,467 --> 00:52:21,332
Detective Ng, could I have a word with you?

784
00:52:23,037 --> 00:52:24,095
There will be room for you soon.

785
00:52:24,606 --> 00:52:25,595
Go.

786
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,631
Bye.
Bye.

787
00:52:29,677 --> 00:52:31,702
Detective Chan.
Yes.

788
00:52:32,013 --> 00:52:33,310
What does that mean?

789
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:38,184
Because you are cool.

790
00:52:46,694 --> 00:52:47,683
Anything yet?

791
00:52:48,429 --> 00:52:51,159
Fung said his shares would go up.

792
00:52:51,499 --> 00:52:53,194
That's hardly relevant.

793
00:52:53,434 --> 00:52:56,232
And his girlfriend is a top model!

794
00:52:56,671 --> 00:52:57,865
I'm not interested.

795
00:52:58,673 --> 00:53:00,766
I'll take it. You go call May.

796
00:53:02,944 --> 00:53:03,933
Go on.

797
00:53:11,152 --> 00:53:12,642
Ka-kui! Listen.

798
00:53:15,557 --> 00:53:17,320
Your conditions have been presented

799
00:53:18,193 --> 00:53:19,421
to the board and they will pay.

800
00:53:20,295 --> 00:53:21,785
No shit. Do you have the money?

801
00:53:22,063 --> 00:53:23,087
We don't have it all.

802
00:53:23,565 --> 00:53:25,931
$10 million is a lot of money.

803
00:53:26,334 --> 00:53:27,323
Trace it.

804
00:53:34,842 --> 00:53:35,831
It's from Tai Po.

805
00:53:35,877 --> 00:53:36,866
Check it out.

806
00:53:56,965 --> 00:53:57,954
He's in Ting Kok Road.

807
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,489
HQ calling all foot patrols.

808
00:54:00,535 --> 00:54:03,902
Are there any units in Ting Kok Road, over?

809
00:54:07,308 --> 00:54:09,503
This is PC 12674 on Ting Kok Road,
over.

810
00:54:10,044 --> 00:54:11,375
PC 12674,

811
00:54:12,146 --> 00:54:13,943
check anybody leaving
a phone box in the area.

812
00:54:17,518 --> 00:54:18,678
Are you stalling for time?

813
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,888
No, we didn't call the police.

814
00:54:21,155 --> 00:54:22,554
Now we want 20 million.

815
00:54:23,224 --> 00:54:26,352
20 million! It's impossible.

816
00:54:26,728 --> 00:54:27,717
Find it.

817
00:54:28,096 --> 00:54:29,358
Wait!

818
00:54:38,339 --> 00:54:39,328
This is PC 12674.

819
00:54:39,607 --> 00:54:40,596
Anything?

820
00:54:40,642 --> 00:54:42,166
I think I've got a suspect.

821
00:54:42,343 --> 00:54:43,935
Be careful. He's very dangerous.

822
00:54:44,178 --> 00:54:45,770
He could be armed.

823
00:54:46,247 --> 00:54:47,407
Keep everything low key.

824
00:54:57,225 --> 00:55:00,717
Excuse me, you're supposed to use
the pedestrian crossing.

825
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:03,219
Go on.

826
00:55:03,665 --> 00:55:04,962
Give me a chance, Officer.

827
00:55:05,533 --> 00:55:06,522
Can I see your ID card?

828
00:55:19,013 --> 00:55:20,002
Calling HQ...

829
00:55:22,183 --> 00:55:31,854
PC 12674, can you hear...

830
00:55:38,533 --> 00:55:41,696
An officer needs assistance
in Ting Kok Road.

831
00:55:45,873 --> 00:55:47,170
I'm sorry, he isn't here.

832
00:55:47,875 --> 00:55:48,864
Don't be sorry.

833
00:55:49,877 --> 00:55:52,209
It's the way things go.
It wasn't your fault.

834
00:55:53,681 --> 00:55:54,909
How long have you been in uniform?

835
00:55:55,183 --> 00:55:56,616
About two months.

836
00:55:57,985 --> 00:55:59,043
Then you're excused.

837
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,982
Will I get in trouble
for losing my gun?

838
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:03,548
What about promotions?!

839
00:56:03,758 --> 00:56:06,625
Don't worry.
As long as you learn

840
00:56:06,794 --> 00:56:09,194
from the experience, it's OK.

841
00:56:09,464 --> 00:56:10,453
It happens to every cop.

842
00:56:10,498 --> 00:56:11,487
It won't happen again.

843
00:56:11,632 --> 00:56:13,099
Do you think you'd recognise him?

844
00:56:13,234 --> 00:56:14,223
Sure.

845
00:56:14,369 --> 00:56:15,358
Phone.

846
00:56:15,937 --> 00:56:17,495
I could do with someone like you on the team.

847
00:56:17,872 --> 00:56:18,861
I'll see to it.

848
00:56:21,209 --> 00:56:23,006
Thank you. Can you file this for me?

849
00:56:24,779 --> 00:56:26,610
Hello.
It's Joker.

850
00:56:26,647 --> 00:56:28,137
Go ahead.
News.

851
00:56:28,182 --> 00:56:29,171
What news?

852
00:56:29,217 --> 00:56:30,878
A guy called Crazy Fai sells dynamite.

853
00:56:31,152 --> 00:56:32,585
Nine o'clock, Hoi Wong Bar.

854
00:56:49,203 --> 00:56:50,864
Do you know what we'll do next?
No.

855
00:56:50,905 --> 00:56:51,894
Really?

856
00:56:57,645 --> 00:56:58,634
What do you want?

857
00:56:58,679 --> 00:57:00,237
Are you Fai? I want to talk.

858
00:57:01,282 --> 00:57:02,271
Do I know you?

859
00:57:02,417 --> 00:57:03,679
No. But you will.

860
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:07,253
All right. Let's go over there.

861
00:57:08,689 --> 00:57:09,678
I'll be right back.

862
00:57:15,196 --> 00:57:17,130
What's your name?
Lo.

863
00:57:17,165 --> 00:57:18,154
What do you want?

864
00:57:18,466 --> 00:57:19,660
Some explosives.

865
00:57:20,568 --> 00:57:21,557
Explosives?

866
00:57:21,602 --> 00:57:22,830
Do you have some?

867
00:57:23,004 --> 00:57:25,029
What are they for?
Fishing.

868
00:57:26,774 --> 00:57:28,207
You don't look like a fisherman.

869
00:57:28,743 --> 00:57:30,540
What if I told you it was for business?

870
00:57:30,711 --> 00:57:31,700
I'll give you a good price.

871
00:57:31,979 --> 00:57:34,038
What do you say?

872
00:57:36,684 --> 00:57:38,879
All right, I need to speak to someone.

873
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,844
It's not my stuff.
Don't go away.

874
00:57:41,422 --> 00:57:42,411
Thanks.

875
00:58:04,245 --> 00:58:05,837
Sorry, he's out of stock

876
00:58:06,247 --> 00:58:08,374
but he'll call me back.

877
00:58:08,616 --> 00:58:11,084
Stay here, I'll be back
when I've finished.

878
00:58:11,118 --> 00:58:12,107
Thank you.

879
00:58:58,032 --> 00:58:59,090
Hey, you. Stand up.

880
00:59:00,668 --> 00:59:01,726
What's the matter?

881
00:59:01,769 --> 00:59:03,566
CID. On your feet.

882
00:59:15,249 --> 00:59:16,238
Hands up.

883
00:59:16,284 --> 00:59:17,444
I only came for a drink.

884
00:59:17,485 --> 00:59:18,179
A drink?

885
00:59:18,219 --> 00:59:19,777
We heard you were dealing contraband.

886
00:59:23,291 --> 00:59:24,280
Eyes front.

887
00:59:32,733 --> 00:59:36,499
Hold it.
Throw me your gun. Quick!

888
00:59:41,208 --> 00:59:42,197
Stand over there.

889
00:59:42,944 --> 00:59:44,741
Easy. Don't do anything stupid.

890
00:59:57,391 --> 00:59:58,824
Come on. Move.

891
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,457
Come out here!

892
01:01:03,858 --> 01:01:04,847
Get lost.

893
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:09,426
You screwed me over. You bastard!
Why did you call the cops?

894
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,934
Stop! Stop it!

895
01:01:19,874 --> 01:01:22,536
Please, that's enough. Please stop.

896
01:01:23,744 --> 01:01:24,733
Why did you do it?

897
01:01:24,779 --> 01:01:26,440
To make sure you weren't a cop.

898
01:01:26,647 --> 01:01:28,308
That's why I called the cops to prove it.

899
01:01:29,016 --> 01:01:30,278
I can get what you need.

900
01:01:30,851 --> 01:01:31,840
Where is it?

901
01:01:31,986 --> 01:01:32,975
Have you got the money?

902
01:01:38,426 --> 01:01:39,723
It's cash on delivery.

903
01:01:43,964 --> 01:01:44,953
Keep a look out.

904
01:02:00,081 --> 01:02:01,070
Is it good stuff?

905
01:02:01,348 --> 01:02:02,747
It's from the quarries.

906
01:02:03,517 --> 01:02:04,506
Got any more?

907
01:02:04,752 --> 01:02:05,741
Yeah, plenty.

908
01:02:13,627 --> 01:02:15,822
There's enough to blow up
the Empire State Building.

909
01:02:17,031 --> 01:02:19,192
I just met him!

910
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,492
I've never seen him before!

911
01:02:24,338 --> 01:02:25,327
Do you think you can get away?

912
01:02:27,875 --> 01:02:28,864
Would you like a coffee?

913
01:02:29,844 --> 01:02:30,833
A cigarette?

914
01:02:37,318 --> 01:02:38,478
Two spoons of sugar?

915
01:02:38,986 --> 01:02:39,975
Yes.

916
01:02:41,388 --> 01:02:42,446
The temperature ok?

917
01:02:46,694 --> 01:02:48,218
Ok.

918
01:02:48,429 --> 01:02:50,727
This will offend the law. I won't do it.

919
01:02:52,032 --> 01:02:53,021
You seem comfortable.

920
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,658
Then should you cooperate with us now?

921
01:02:55,770 --> 01:02:56,759
Cooperation?

922
01:02:57,538 --> 01:02:58,527
You want me die?

923
01:02:58,572 --> 01:03:00,130
If you cooperate, you will walk out of here.

924
01:03:00,674 --> 01:03:01,971
We will keep everything secret.

925
01:03:02,176 --> 01:03:03,837
If needed, we will keep you under protection.

926
01:03:04,945 --> 01:03:07,812
If you three could protect me
for my whole life,

927
01:03:08,315 --> 01:03:09,339
then I would consider it.

928
01:03:12,386 --> 01:03:13,785
Don't talk that way.

929
01:03:14,088 --> 01:03:15,419
Even if we release you now,

930
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:16,879
after you get out of here,

931
01:03:17,324 --> 01:03:20,350
we will find drugs on you.
Well...

932
01:03:20,728 --> 01:03:22,787
we could also find you guilty
for raping young girl.

933
01:03:25,166 --> 01:03:26,861
Have you had good results this way?

934
01:03:27,735 --> 01:03:29,134
Sure. It never fails.

935
01:03:33,407 --> 01:03:35,272
What's the charge?

936
01:03:35,576 --> 01:03:38,272
I've seen a lot worse than this

937
01:03:39,113 --> 01:03:40,375
before going to jail, I'll play along.

938
01:03:55,029 --> 01:03:57,088
You all seem like nice young ladies...

939
01:04:02,903 --> 01:04:03,892
Have you not seen anything like this before?

940
01:04:09,376 --> 01:04:11,037
No! Stop! I've had enough.

941
01:04:11,245 --> 01:04:13,543
No, please!

942
01:04:15,583 --> 01:04:16,914
Nice young ladies, huh?

943
01:04:23,624 --> 01:04:24,648
Aren't you going to play along?

944
01:04:25,192 --> 01:04:26,489
I'll sue you!

945
01:04:28,229 --> 01:04:31,027
Say that again. Guns have a habit of
going off when you least expect it.

946
01:04:31,265 --> 01:04:32,459
We'll just say it was an accident.

947
01:04:32,833 --> 01:04:34,528
Yeah. Escaped prisoner!

948
01:04:34,735 --> 01:04:38,034
Good. Get my gun!

949
01:04:38,572 --> 01:04:40,267
No! I'll talk.

950
01:04:40,407 --> 01:04:41,396
Why didn't you say so?

951
01:04:41,442 --> 01:04:43,239
Come on, sit down.

952
01:04:43,677 --> 01:04:45,235
Cigarette?

953
01:04:45,512 --> 01:04:46,501
No.

954
01:04:47,815 --> 01:04:48,804
There are men in here.

955
01:04:53,954 --> 01:04:54,943
Show's over.

956
01:04:57,591 --> 01:04:58,956
I have sold some explosives lately.

957
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:01,052
One buyer was a fisherman.

958
01:05:01,762 --> 01:05:02,751
I've known him for long.

959
01:05:03,197 --> 01:05:04,357
After buying, he sold it to someone
who used to blast reef fish.

960
01:05:05,165 --> 01:05:06,359
The other one buys my stuff

961
01:05:07,101 --> 01:05:08,659
to refill empty bullet shell cases

962
01:05:08,869 --> 01:05:10,268
and then he sells them as bullets.

963
01:05:10,704 --> 01:05:11,762
Yet he had only sold a few.

964
01:05:12,539 --> 01:05:13,528
The third guy's name was Polar Bear.

965
01:05:13,774 --> 01:05:16,072
He's a big-time dealer.

966
01:05:16,877 --> 01:05:18,572
He often hangs out at the Yaumatei Pool Hall.

967
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:44,559
Taxi

968
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:51,099
Target on a taxi.

969
01:05:51,178 --> 01:05:52,440
It's BP5608.

970
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,069
Big mouth, got it?

971
01:05:54,615 --> 01:05:56,276
Taxi number BP5608.

972
01:05:56,517 --> 01:05:57,848
Heading north to Kok Road.

973
01:06:00,254 --> 01:06:01,243
Big mouth copied.

974
01:06:01,288 --> 01:06:03,279
I see target BP5608.

975
01:06:10,564 --> 01:06:12,054
It changes to TST metro station.

976
01:06:13,067 --> 01:06:15,262
All copy.

977
01:06:15,536 --> 01:06:16,525
Renew info.

978
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:18,231
Get to TST metro station.

979
01:07:39,787 --> 01:07:40,913
Target on metro heading Kung Tong.

980
01:07:41,889 --> 01:07:42,878
Copied.

981
01:07:45,626 --> 01:07:46,615
Stay there.

982
01:07:46,727 --> 01:07:47,716
Yes.

983
01:08:19,326 --> 01:08:20,759
Target off metro.

984
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:04,559
Target on a taxi.

985
01:09:04,771 --> 01:09:05,897
It's CW721,

986
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,164
heading Industrial area.

987
01:09:14,248 --> 01:09:15,442
Target off the car.

988
01:09:15,749 --> 01:09:16,738
Heading Yat Sing Street.

989
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:17,839
Copied. Over.

990
01:09:17,885 --> 01:09:18,874
Sum, your team leave first.

991
01:09:22,856 --> 01:09:24,153
Car to Yat Sing Street.

992
01:09:24,491 --> 01:09:26,118
Start supervision. Wait for orders.

993
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:27,449
Yes.

994
01:09:38,138 --> 01:09:39,127
I'll take a look.

995
01:09:49,616 --> 01:09:50,913
Pal, where is Pak Lok Street?

996
01:09:50,984 --> 01:09:51,973
Don't know.

997
01:09:52,019 --> 01:09:53,008
Thanks.

998
01:09:55,055 --> 01:09:57,114
Someone carrying two bags heading your way.

999
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,020
Polar Bear.

1000
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:07,889
You went shopping?

1001
01:10:09,369 --> 01:10:10,358
Were you followed?

1002
01:10:10,404 --> 01:10:11,496
No. Don't worry.

1003
01:10:14,241 --> 01:10:15,230
Come on. Open up.

1004
01:10:16,109 --> 01:10:17,098
There are three of them.

1005
01:10:27,554 --> 01:10:28,987
Detective Chan, it's the him.

1006
01:10:29,323 --> 01:10:30,312
Must be them.

1007
01:10:38,899 --> 01:10:39,888
Three persons' voices.

1008
01:10:48,208 --> 01:10:49,607
Louder, let me hear it.

1009
01:10:51,078 --> 01:10:53,273
Brother, stop waiting...

1010
01:10:53,981 --> 01:10:55,505
All things prepared?

1011
01:10:57,651 --> 01:10:59,346
Of course.

1012
01:11:00,254 --> 01:11:02,085
Then, I have to make a call.

1013
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,789
Not here.

1014
01:11:15,035 --> 01:11:16,161
Make sure no one bugging.

1015
01:11:17,104 --> 01:11:18,571
Find a place in TST.

1016
01:11:18,772 --> 01:11:19,830
Make sure everything is fine.

1017
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:21,698
No wasting time. Get going.

1018
01:11:35,622 --> 01:11:36,611
Three persons.

1019
01:11:39,226 --> 01:11:40,318
They're coming out.

1020
01:11:40,761 --> 01:11:41,750
Copied.

1021
01:11:41,995 --> 01:11:43,189
You don't derseve this.

1022
01:11:43,397 --> 01:11:44,386
It's you who doesn't deserve it.

1023
01:12:02,115 --> 01:12:04,379
Check the number plate
and follow the van.

1024
01:12:05,419 --> 01:12:06,681
You stay here, I'll go and take a look.

1025
01:12:11,091 --> 01:12:13,184
Right.

1026
01:12:13,427 --> 01:12:14,416
Let's go.

1027
01:12:19,433 --> 01:12:20,422
We now start the car.

1028
01:13:02,209 --> 01:13:03,198
Yes.

1029
01:13:03,710 --> 01:13:04,699
Where are you going?

1030
01:13:04,745 --> 01:13:06,406
To take a look.
Be careful.

1031
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:07,469
I will.

1032
01:13:08,115 --> 01:13:09,104
I see.

1033
01:13:09,950 --> 01:13:12,145
Detective Chan,
they've shaken off our unit.

1034
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:14,243
They'll come back.

1035
01:13:14,654 --> 01:13:15,643
Call them off.

1036
01:13:17,557 --> 01:13:18,615
Come back here.

1037
01:15:05,298 --> 01:15:06,595
Don't shoot! It's me!

1038
01:15:06,967 --> 01:15:07,956
Be quiet.

1039
01:15:14,508 --> 01:15:15,497
You scared me.

1040
01:15:15,542 --> 01:15:17,407
I fell over.
Someone's up there.

1041
01:15:35,061 --> 01:15:36,050
Hold it!

1042
01:15:39,733 --> 01:15:40,722
Turn around.

1043
01:15:45,605 --> 01:15:46,833
Police! Who are you?

1044
01:15:50,243 --> 01:15:51,835
The guy must be deaf and dumb.

1045
01:15:52,379 --> 01:15:57,783
Did you see three men
come through here a few hours ago?

1046
01:16:04,457 --> 01:16:05,481
You ask him.

1047
01:16:09,596 --> 01:16:13,293
Do you work here?

1048
01:16:16,269 --> 01:16:19,500
Do you sleep here?

1049
01:16:25,345 --> 01:16:27,108
Right. I got an answer

1050
01:16:27,781 --> 01:16:29,942
but I have no idea what it means.

1051
01:16:30,383 --> 01:16:31,372
You ask him.

1052
01:16:31,618 --> 01:16:32,607
Take him to the station.

1053
01:16:35,288 --> 01:16:37,848
It's OK. You're coming with me,
just for questions.

1054
01:16:38,058 --> 01:16:39,389
Come, it won't cost anything.

1055
01:16:39,726 --> 01:16:40,715
No need to lock.

1056
01:16:44,030 --> 01:16:46,931
You don't need those.

1057
01:16:48,001 --> 01:16:49,525
He's deaf.

1058
01:16:49,836 --> 01:16:54,000
Are all these toys in here yours?

1059
01:17:29,709 --> 01:17:30,698
Stop!

1060
01:17:30,744 --> 01:17:31,733
He can't hear you.

1061
01:17:43,089 --> 01:17:44,078
Help me find my gun.

1062
01:17:59,205 --> 01:18:02,197
Sir! Are you all right?

1063
01:18:02,742 --> 01:18:05,302
There's a deaf-mute running around,
find him.

1064
01:18:05,578 --> 01:18:06,636
Right!

1065
01:18:07,781 --> 01:18:09,180
I didn't know he could fight.

1066
01:18:09,449 --> 01:18:11,212
Neither did I. Go and find my gun.

1067
01:18:11,451 --> 01:18:12,440
Ok.

1068
01:18:15,021 --> 01:18:17,216
If we can find the backing to finance

1069
01:18:17,490 --> 01:18:18,616
the buy out of Indian Ocean Bank,

1070
01:18:18,792 --> 01:18:22,728
it'll be a welcome addition
to our portfolio.

1071
01:18:22,962 --> 01:18:24,486
Mr Fung, telephone.

1072
01:18:25,065 --> 01:18:26,191
I said no calls.

1073
01:18:26,733 --> 01:18:29,031
I know, but it's that man again.

1074
01:18:29,836 --> 01:18:30,825
Jimmy.

1075
01:18:33,239 --> 01:18:34,228
Excuse me.

1076
01:18:47,587 --> 01:18:48,679
You called the cops.

1077
01:18:49,756 --> 01:18:51,121
No, you must be mistaken.
We haven't...

1078
01:18:51,725 --> 01:18:54,558
Cut the crap.
We knew you'd go to the cops.

1079
01:19:15,014 --> 01:19:16,038
But we won't change our minds at all.

1080
01:19:16,616 --> 01:19:17,605
After 12p.m. Tomorrow,

1081
01:19:17,751 --> 01:19:20,083
if you still agree to pay
the $20 million,

1082
01:19:20,386 --> 01:19:23,446
publish an ad for your company in one

1083
01:19:23,723 --> 01:19:25,884
of the newspapers tomorrow morning.

1084
01:19:26,826 --> 01:19:27,815
Again.

1085
01:19:28,228 --> 01:19:29,217
Where was the call from?

1086
01:19:29,295 --> 01:19:31,286
It was a modified mobile

1087
01:19:31,498 --> 01:19:32,487
so we couldn't trace it.

1088
01:19:32,599 --> 01:19:33,759
We knew you'd go the cops.

1089
01:19:34,234 --> 01:19:35,394
But it doesn't change things.

1090
01:19:35,869 --> 01:19:37,393
We'll show what we can do

1091
01:19:37,637 --> 01:19:39,264
with our explosives at 12 tomorrow.

1092
01:19:39,773 --> 01:19:40,762
We won't waste time

1093
01:19:40,807 --> 01:19:42,832
bargaining with you again.

1094
01:19:43,243 --> 01:19:44,642
Don't worry, they're bluffing.

1095
01:19:45,378 --> 01:19:46,367
We've sent extra officers

1096
01:19:46,513 --> 01:19:47,912
to protect your buildings.

1097
01:19:49,382 --> 01:19:50,371
You'll be fine.

1098
01:19:52,185 --> 01:19:53,174
Listen,

1099
01:19:53,319 --> 01:19:55,685
this blackmail has gone on
long enough. It's time to act.

1100
01:20:01,027 --> 01:20:02,016
Fey,

1101
01:20:02,762 --> 01:20:03,751
long time no see.

1102
01:20:05,265 --> 01:20:06,254
Polar Bear.

1103
01:20:06,566 --> 01:20:08,796
This is Ken.

1104
01:20:11,538 --> 01:20:12,527
I didn't grass you up!

1105
01:20:12,572 --> 01:20:13,504
Really?

1106
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:15,565
Why did they turn up after you got caught?

1107
01:20:16,042 --> 01:20:18,033
Why did they let you go so easily?

1108
01:20:18,311 --> 01:20:20,404
Because they couldn't keep me
with no evidence.

1109
01:20:21,581 --> 01:20:22,843
I didn't grass you up, I swear!

1110
01:20:24,083 --> 01:20:25,345
It makes no difference,

1111
01:20:26,085 --> 01:20:27,643
we've made other arrangements.

1112
01:20:28,321 --> 01:20:29,310
Where are we going?!

1113
01:20:29,355 --> 01:20:30,344
You'll find out.

1114
01:20:31,024 --> 01:20:32,013
Miss Wong. What is it?

1115
01:20:32,759 --> 01:20:33,748
We've checked the mail.

1116
01:20:34,561 --> 01:20:35,550
Thanks.

1117
01:20:35,595 --> 01:20:36,584
And these are for you.

1118
01:20:37,597 --> 01:20:38,586
Who sent that?

1119
01:20:38,631 --> 01:20:40,189
Don't know. Someone special?

1120
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,924
If you don't know, who would?

1121
01:20:42,502 --> 01:20:43,491
Thanks.

1122
01:20:49,209 --> 01:20:50,301
Plant this bomb

1123
01:20:50,610 --> 01:20:51,975
and we're even.

1124
01:20:54,113 --> 01:20:55,603
Do the job or you're finished.

1125
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:57,405
Where shall I put it?

1126
01:20:57,450 --> 01:20:58,439
I'll tell you later.

1127
01:20:58,952 --> 01:20:59,941
Let's go.

1128
01:21:05,959 --> 01:21:07,051
Roger. Thanks a lot.

1129
01:21:11,631 --> 01:21:12,620
Ready.

1130
01:21:17,804 --> 01:21:19,203
I'm a cop. What's this?

1131
01:21:20,073 --> 01:21:21,062
I'm a cop.

1132
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:37,353
I.D. Card

1133
01:21:38,858 --> 01:21:39,847
What?

1134
01:21:39,893 --> 01:21:40,882
Nothing.

1135
01:21:42,028 --> 01:21:43,017
Nothing.

1136
01:21:52,171 --> 01:21:54,799
CID. Your case.

1137
01:21:55,074 --> 01:21:56,302
Well?

1138
01:22:03,683 --> 01:22:04,672
Nothing.

1139
01:22:04,918 --> 01:22:06,010
Ok.

1140
01:22:06,786 --> 01:22:07,775
What's that?

1141
01:22:12,392 --> 01:22:13,882
Excuse me, CID. May I see your bag?

1142
01:22:23,736 --> 01:22:24,725
The red bag.

1143
01:22:24,771 --> 01:22:25,760
Excuse me, CID.

1144
01:22:39,786 --> 01:22:40,775
Make it quick.

1145
01:22:45,391 --> 01:22:46,380
It should be fine.

1146
01:22:46,426 --> 01:22:47,654
Here's the mail, sir.

1147
01:22:50,596 --> 01:22:51,585
Roger.

1148
01:22:53,132 --> 01:22:54,121
Do you think it's a bluff?

1149
01:22:54,534 --> 01:22:57,367
I hope so, but we can't be sure.

1150
01:22:59,072 --> 01:23:00,232
Talk to you later. Yes?

1151
01:23:06,179 --> 01:23:07,168
Tell her he's coming.

1152
01:23:08,114 --> 01:23:09,103
Roger.

1153
01:23:10,083 --> 01:23:12,074
Ka-kui, May's downstairs.

1154
01:23:12,452 --> 01:23:13,646
She wants to talk to you urgently.

1155
01:23:15,788 --> 01:23:16,777
Thanks.

1156
01:23:19,058 --> 01:23:21,891
May. What's the matter?

1157
01:23:24,530 --> 01:23:26,657
I've written a letter for you. Bye.

1158
01:23:28,401 --> 01:23:31,564
May. You came all this way
to give me this?

1159
01:23:32,005 --> 01:23:34,803
It's important so keep it safe. Bye.

1160
01:23:36,843 --> 01:23:38,401
Oh, yeah, where's the scooter?

1161
01:23:38,945 --> 01:23:41,846
We didn't get along so I sold it.

1162
01:23:48,054 --> 01:23:49,043
I'll follow her.

1163
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:02,658
I have my backup units in position.

1164
01:24:05,238 --> 01:24:06,671
Yes. I think they're bluffing.

1165
01:24:06,906 --> 01:24:08,100
Then we should depend on the police.

1166
01:24:08,307 --> 01:24:09,296
All right.

1167
01:24:11,077 --> 01:24:12,066
What is going on?

1168
01:24:15,915 --> 01:24:16,904
Get an ambulance.

1169
01:24:16,983 --> 01:24:17,972
Get the fire extinguisher.

1170
01:24:18,418 --> 01:24:19,885
Call Mr. Lam.

1171
01:24:35,701 --> 01:24:36,690
Why this happened?

1172
01:24:44,444 --> 01:24:45,433
Go investigate.

1173
01:24:45,478 --> 01:24:46,502
Stay calm.

1174
01:24:46,546 --> 01:24:47,478
Don't panic.

1175
01:24:47,513 --> 01:24:48,502
Ka-kui, come with me.

1176
01:24:48,548 --> 01:24:49,537
Call the fire department. Come on!

1177
01:24:54,687 --> 01:24:56,086
Bring a fire extinguisher.

1178
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:01,148
Come on. Put the fire out first.

1179
01:25:01,894 --> 01:25:02,883
Come on, get moving.

1180
01:25:03,162 --> 01:25:04,151
Ambulance here?

1181
01:25:04,197 --> 01:25:05,061
No.

1182
01:25:05,098 --> 01:25:06,087
Go make calls.

1183
01:25:10,336 --> 01:25:11,325
We need more help.

1184
01:25:11,370 --> 01:25:12,359
Phone, sir.

1185
01:25:12,638 --> 01:25:13,798
Bill, you take the phone call.

1186
01:25:14,273 --> 01:25:16,207
Ka-kui, meet me upstairs.

1187
01:25:24,050 --> 01:25:25,176
I thought you were supposed to protect me.

1188
01:25:32,024 --> 01:25:33,013
What's up?

1189
01:25:33,292 --> 01:25:34,919
Parcel bomb. Miss Wong lost an arm.

1190
01:25:50,543 --> 01:25:51,532
How's Miss Wong?

1191
01:25:51,577 --> 01:25:53,511
She's doing well.

1192
01:25:53,913 --> 01:25:55,904
The doctor said her arm would recover.

1193
01:25:56,949 --> 01:25:59,076
They'll do a skin graft
on her face later.

1194
01:26:00,419 --> 01:26:01,408
So we'll wait and see.

1195
01:26:04,357 --> 01:26:05,619
Wong's decided to pay up.

1196
01:26:06,826 --> 01:26:08,088
What am I going to tell Raymond?

1197
01:26:10,363 --> 01:26:12,354
Uncle Bill, that's the way it goes.

1198
01:26:12,965 --> 01:26:14,262
We said it'd be a tough case.

1199
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:15,232
We're dealing with

1200
01:26:15,268 --> 01:26:16,895
an organised bunch of criminals here.

1201
01:26:17,770 --> 01:26:19,795
I wish they'd blown me up instead.

1202
01:26:20,006 --> 01:26:21,166
I don't like putting lives at risk.

1203
01:26:22,008 --> 01:26:23,737
Don't worry.

1204
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:25,534
If they come and collect the money,
I'm sure we'll get them.

1205
01:26:26,078 --> 01:26:27,375
If I pass on what you said to Raymond,

1206
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:29,609
he'll not be happy at all.

1207
01:26:30,449 --> 01:26:32,076
What we need is real action.

1208
01:26:33,853 --> 01:26:35,047
Sir

1209
01:26:37,156 --> 01:26:38,145
I guess you've seen the papers.

1210
01:26:38,658 --> 01:26:40,649
Now what do I tell the chief?

1211
01:26:48,134 --> 01:26:50,796
That's the way it goes.

1212
01:26:51,237 --> 01:26:52,261
We said it'd be a tough case.

1213
01:26:52,505 --> 01:26:53,938
We're dealing with

1214
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,969
an organised bunch of criminals here.

1215
01:26:56,909 --> 01:26:59,241
I wish they'd blown me up instead.

1216
01:26:59,545 --> 01:27:01,274
I don't like putting lives at risk.

1217
01:27:02,148 --> 01:27:04,810
Don't worry.

1218
01:27:05,284 --> 01:27:08,082
If they come and collect the money,
I'm sure we'll get them.

1219
01:27:08,287 --> 01:27:09,276
All this is talk,

1220
01:27:09,422 --> 01:27:10,650
what we need is some real action.

1221
01:27:22,501 --> 01:27:25,061
Something's up. Raymond's in trouble.

1222
01:27:28,808 --> 01:27:29,832
That's the way it goes.

1223
01:27:30,209 --> 01:27:32,177
We said it'd be a tough case.

1224
01:27:32,612 --> 01:27:34,477
We're dealing with

1225
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:35,806
an organised bunch of criminals here.

1226
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:41,011
I wish they'd blown me up instead.

1227
01:27:41,487 --> 01:27:42,579
I don't like putting lives at risk.

1228
01:27:43,256 --> 01:27:44,245
Don't worry.

1229
01:27:44,557 --> 01:27:47,390
If they come and collect
I'm sure we'll get them.

1230
01:27:47,727 --> 01:27:49,024
I understand your situation

1231
01:27:49,295 --> 01:27:50,660
and I'll note it in the report.

1232
01:27:50,963 --> 01:27:54,228
Good luck with the case.

1233
01:28:03,075 --> 01:28:04,235
You come, too.

1234
01:28:07,513 --> 01:28:08,844
Why the long face?

1235
01:28:09,081 --> 01:28:10,070
Did you two have a fight?

1236
01:28:10,783 --> 01:28:13,013
Right! But it's the last one.

1237
01:28:27,433 --> 01:28:28,422
Yes? I'll get him.

1238
01:28:28,467 --> 01:28:29,456
Hold this.

1239
01:28:31,103 --> 01:28:33,094
Ka-kui, phone.

1240
01:28:33,339 --> 01:28:34,328
Put it through.

1241
01:28:35,241 --> 01:28:36,230
Right. Put it through.

1242
01:28:38,911 --> 01:28:39,900
Hello. Ka-kui.

1243
01:28:40,112 --> 01:28:41,511
May's been kidnapped!

1244
01:28:41,847 --> 01:28:42,836
When?

1245
01:28:42,882 --> 01:28:44,281
We'd just left the shop

1246
01:28:44,450 --> 01:28:46,008
and someone lifted her into a van.

1247
01:28:46,285 --> 01:28:47,547
Who did it?

1248
01:28:48,054 --> 01:28:51,114
I don't know. But it must be
something to do with you.

1249
01:28:51,324 --> 01:28:53,224
Could it be those thugs again?

1250
01:28:53,659 --> 01:28:55,388
Chu Tu.

1251
01:28:56,262 --> 01:28:58,389
Ka-kui... Hello?

1252
01:29:01,701 --> 01:29:02,690
Ka-kui! What's up?

1253
01:29:02,735 --> 01:29:04,635
An old score.

1254
01:29:05,071 --> 01:29:06,060
Ka-kui!

1255
01:29:06,706 --> 01:29:07,695
What happened?

1256
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:08,729
May is caught.

1257
01:29:09,475 --> 01:29:11,773
What's the matter?
Sign this cheque before you're dead.

1258
01:29:11,811 --> 01:29:12,641
Our brothers...

1259
01:29:12,678 --> 01:29:13,736
Please stop.
He's a patient.

1260
01:29:13,779 --> 01:29:14,711
Let me finish.

1261
01:29:14,747 --> 01:29:17,147
We did what you asked.
That's why we deserve something.

1262
01:29:17,350 --> 01:29:18,749
You won't need
any money when you're dead.

1263
01:29:33,632 --> 01:29:34,621
Chu Tu!

1264
01:29:37,670 --> 01:29:38,659
Chu Tu! Hey, you!

1265
01:30:15,808 --> 01:30:16,797
Chu Tu! Chu Tu!

1266
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:22,369
Where is May?

1267
01:30:22,515 --> 01:30:23,504
I don't know.

1268
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:24,913
I didn't do anything. It's him.

1269
01:30:27,653 --> 01:30:28,745
Where the hell's May?

1270
01:30:30,189 --> 01:30:31,520
Stop it! He's sick.

1271
01:30:32,024 --> 01:30:33,013
Put him down.

1272
01:30:33,626 --> 01:30:35,184
Where did you take her?

1273
01:30:35,428 --> 01:30:36,554
I didn't take her.

1274
01:30:36,796 --> 01:30:37,785
Who did then?

1275
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:39,161
I was very nasty to you before.

1276
01:30:39,365 --> 01:30:40,730
But now I'm sick and penniless.

1277
01:30:41,033 --> 01:30:43,729
Why would I take her?

1278
01:30:43,969 --> 01:30:45,766
He's got no money now.

1279
01:30:45,971 --> 01:30:47,165
It has nothing to do with us.

1280
01:30:47,506 --> 01:30:49,371
He made your life miserable.

1281
01:30:49,542 --> 01:30:50,907
We did it because of money.

1282
01:30:52,378 --> 01:30:53,367
Then who could it be?

1283
01:30:56,248 --> 01:30:57,943
There's a phone over there.

1284
01:30:58,918 --> 01:31:00,476
Don't die before you sign this!
Sign this cheque before you're dead.

1285
01:31:00,653 --> 01:31:02,621
You...

1286
01:31:02,755 --> 01:31:04,814
He's nearly dead, so I won't care.

1287
01:31:04,990 --> 01:31:07,015
If not, maybe I will.

1288
01:31:19,472 --> 01:31:20,461
Hello?

1289
01:31:20,606 --> 01:31:21,595
Ka-kui!

1290
01:31:21,807 --> 01:31:23,172
May!

1291
01:31:23,509 --> 01:31:24,771
You recognise her voice.

1292
01:31:25,077 --> 01:31:26,942
We're at the Hung Fung Industrial Building.

1293
01:31:27,313 --> 01:31:28,905
Who is this? What do you want?

1294
01:31:29,415 --> 01:31:31,883
Come alone or she's dead.

1295
01:31:32,318 --> 01:31:35,617
Wait!

1296
01:31:36,989 --> 01:31:37,978
I know where it is.

1297
01:32:13,859 --> 01:32:17,625
May! Are you all right?

1298
01:32:21,066 --> 01:32:22,055
Be quiet.

1299
01:32:22,334 --> 01:32:23,323
Are you all right?

1300
01:32:23,502 --> 01:32:24,491
I'm OK.

1301
01:32:24,670 --> 01:32:25,659
Why have you kidnapped her?

1302
01:32:26,071 --> 01:32:28,835
Ka-kui, by the time you read
this letter...

1303
01:32:29,041 --> 01:32:30,030
Stop!

1304
01:32:30,175 --> 01:32:31,506
...l've decided we should be apart.

1305
01:32:31,710 --> 01:32:32,699
No.

1306
01:32:33,178 --> 01:32:35,612
I don't think I'll see you again.

1307
01:32:36,148 --> 01:32:38,275
It's a love letter!

1308
01:32:40,152 --> 01:32:43,246
Just like they say,
Unlucky in love, lucky in money.

1309
01:32:43,489 --> 01:32:44,478
There's more.

1310
01:32:44,590 --> 01:32:45,579
Bastard!

1311
01:32:45,724 --> 01:32:49,751
When we met,
I thought you liked your job very much

1312
01:32:50,029 --> 01:32:53,021
and you'd be my Mr Right.

1313
01:32:53,265 --> 01:32:55,233
Now I realise the only thing

1314
01:32:55,401 --> 01:32:58,063
that matters in your life is your work.

1315
01:32:58,304 --> 01:33:02,240
I tell myself that what
made me fall in love with you

1316
01:33:02,575 --> 01:33:06,170
is also what
made me want to leave you.

1317
01:33:06,979 --> 01:33:09,379
Yeah, why? Why did you break up?

1318
01:33:10,783 --> 01:33:14,310
You told me that

1319
01:33:14,687 --> 01:33:15,881
you didn't want me involved with your work,

1320
01:33:16,188 --> 01:33:17,212
but I didn't mind.

1321
01:33:17,423 --> 01:33:20,119
You never spent
enough time with me.

1322
01:33:20,326 --> 01:33:23,022
Being with you was
the happiest time in my life.

1323
01:33:23,295 --> 01:33:25,160
But when you weren't there,

1324
01:33:25,397 --> 01:33:28,764
it was the worst time of my life.

1325
01:33:29,001 --> 01:33:30,229
That's not right.

1326
01:33:30,402 --> 01:33:32,632
If I didn't leave you,

1327
01:33:32,938 --> 01:33:36,635
I'd spend my life waiting
for you to come home...

1328
01:33:37,176 --> 01:33:38,905
Can't you stop it?!

1329
01:33:42,514 --> 01:33:43,674
She's crying!

1330
01:33:44,049 --> 01:33:45,038
So is he.

1331
01:33:46,218 --> 01:33:47,207
Keep reading, go on.

1332
01:33:48,687 --> 01:33:52,521
...because you can never stop
being a policeman.

1333
01:33:52,891 --> 01:33:54,415
A policeman who never stops.

1334
01:33:55,527 --> 01:33:56,619
We're in trouble.

1335
01:33:57,429 --> 01:34:00,193
I think it's the right decision.

1336
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:05,660
Please forgive me for making
such a selfish choice, May.

1337
01:34:10,643 --> 01:34:11,632
What do you want?

1338
01:34:12,077 --> 01:34:14,545
We want you to help us get rich.

1339
01:34:15,547 --> 01:34:17,981
Our speciality is blackmail

1340
01:34:20,285 --> 01:34:22,981
and the hardest part of it is the pick up.

1341
01:34:25,057 --> 01:34:26,581
You'll collect the ransom for us.

1342
01:34:26,792 --> 01:34:27,781
No way!

1343
01:34:28,127 --> 01:34:29,116
You don't have a choice.

1344
01:34:29,628 --> 01:34:32,062
He said no.

1345
01:34:40,506 --> 01:34:42,064
I think you'll enjoy this.

1346
01:34:45,177 --> 01:34:46,166
Stop!

1347
01:34:46,912 --> 01:34:49,107
Don't!

1348
01:34:49,548 --> 01:34:51,277
Stop it! Please!

1349
01:34:51,617 --> 01:34:54,950
Stop it!

1350
01:34:55,220 --> 01:34:58,383
Please stop it!

1351
01:34:59,491 --> 01:35:00,719
Ka-kui, are you hurt?

1352
01:35:02,695 --> 01:35:03,684
Don't worry.

1353
01:35:06,465 --> 01:35:07,625
So you want to play the hero?

1354
01:35:26,251 --> 01:35:27,684
Now it's your turn.

1355
01:35:40,299 --> 01:35:41,288
Please don't!

1356
01:35:54,580 --> 01:35:55,569
You rotten swine!

1357
01:35:57,850 --> 01:35:58,839
Nice one!

1358
01:35:59,685 --> 01:36:00,674
Kill me if you have the guts.

1359
01:36:00,919 --> 01:36:02,045
So tough!

1360
01:36:02,521 --> 01:36:06,423
Really? Let's see if his girl
is tough, too.

1361
01:36:09,328 --> 01:36:10,317
What do you want?

1362
01:36:12,431 --> 01:36:19,599
How's that?! How's that?

1363
01:36:20,539 --> 01:36:22,404
Enough! You've made your point.

1364
01:36:23,909 --> 01:36:24,898
Does that mean you'll do it?

1365
01:36:25,644 --> 01:36:28,408
Just let her go. I'll do anything.

1366
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:29,877
We won't let her go

1367
01:36:30,149 --> 01:36:31,446
unless you help us.

1368
01:36:32,050 --> 01:36:33,278
What do you want me to do?

1369
01:36:33,485 --> 01:36:35,885
Collect the money for us.

1370
01:36:37,156 --> 01:36:38,145
You don't have any choice.

1371
01:36:48,133 --> 01:36:49,122
I'll do it.

1372
01:36:49,434 --> 01:36:50,423
Good man.

1373
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:16,352
I wouldn't advise you to remove it.

1374
01:37:17,129 --> 01:37:19,529
Break one wire and the whole thing blows.

1375
01:37:20,866 --> 01:37:23,357
The same thing happens
if I press this button.

1376
01:37:29,908 --> 01:37:32,035
You'd better be careful.

1377
01:37:49,661 --> 01:37:50,650
Ka-kui.

1378
01:37:53,632 --> 01:37:54,621
Be careful.

1379
01:37:56,068 --> 01:37:57,057
I'll come back for you.

1380
01:38:13,752 --> 01:38:14,741
Ready?

1381
01:38:14,887 --> 01:38:15,876
He's on the line.

1382
01:38:15,921 --> 01:38:16,910
Trace the call.

1383
01:38:17,055 --> 01:38:18,044
I'll get Uncle Bill.

1384
01:38:19,791 --> 01:38:20,780
Is the money ready?

1385
01:38:20,826 --> 01:38:22,953
We'll collect it in 10 minutes.

1386
01:38:23,462 --> 01:38:24,451
It's ready.

1387
01:38:24,663 --> 01:38:25,652
Did you call the cops?

1388
01:38:25,831 --> 01:38:26,820
No.

1389
01:38:39,578 --> 01:38:40,567
Where's Ka-kui?

1390
01:38:40,612 --> 01:38:41,601
I can't find him.

1391
01:38:42,347 --> 01:38:44,406
How could he be so irresponsible?

1392
01:38:44,449 --> 01:38:45,438
I can't wait.

1393
01:38:45,484 --> 01:38:47,384
Don't take any risks.

1394
01:38:47,819 --> 01:38:48,808
Let's go.

1395
01:38:56,929 --> 01:38:59,625
You'll have 10 minutes
to get back here again.

1396
01:39:00,299 --> 01:39:01,391
No tricks.

1397
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:03,267
If we don't get our money,

1398
01:39:03,769 --> 01:39:05,430
your vest will go bang!

1399
01:39:07,306 --> 01:39:08,295
We'll be waiting.

1400
01:39:10,008 --> 01:39:10,997
Get going.

1401
01:39:16,148 --> 01:39:17,137
Good luck.

1402
01:39:25,290 --> 01:39:26,279
Yes?

1403
01:39:26,325 --> 01:39:27,314
Police officers.

1404
01:39:30,395 --> 01:39:31,487
Mr. Fung Chairman

1405
01:39:31,763 --> 01:39:32,752
You will pay me.

1406
01:39:33,432 --> 01:39:34,831
How you know?

1407
01:39:35,367 --> 01:39:36,356
Please sit.

1408
01:39:38,303 --> 01:39:39,998
You promised to bug

1409
01:39:41,807 --> 01:39:43,900
We could check it.

1410
01:39:44,109 --> 01:39:45,906
It's bad that you aren't that effective
when handling the bomb case.

1411
01:39:46,078 --> 01:39:47,067
We have everything ready.

1412
01:39:47,145 --> 01:39:48,635
Once they pay the money,
we will have our action.

1413
01:39:48,814 --> 01:39:50,907
Hope you won't do anything
to make anything worse.

1414
01:39:51,149 --> 01:39:52,844
Because this will encourage the bombers.

1415
01:39:53,118 --> 01:39:54,415
So they police couldn't help.

1416
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:56,051
We could only depend on ourselves.

1417
01:40:02,027 --> 01:40:03,016
Ka-kui, the boss was looking...

1418
01:40:03,061 --> 01:40:05,825
Ka-kui! It's Ka-kui.

1419
01:40:06,398 --> 01:40:07,387
Ka-kui!

1420
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:09,965
Ka-kui! Out of my way.

1421
01:40:10,602 --> 01:40:13,332
Let me go!

1422
01:40:14,106 --> 01:40:16,097
Get out of my way!

1423
01:40:17,876 --> 01:40:19,673
Ka-kui!

1424
01:40:22,447 --> 01:40:23,436
Excuse me.

1425
01:40:27,185 --> 01:40:28,174
Ka-kui.

1426
01:40:28,854 --> 01:40:30,082
Ka-kui, where have you been?

1427
01:40:30,355 --> 01:40:32,755
Never mind. I'm here to collect the money.

1428
01:40:33,191 --> 01:40:34,180
What?!

1429
01:40:34,393 --> 01:40:35,382
Is he your man?

1430
01:40:35,427 --> 01:40:36,394
Yes, he is.

1431
01:40:36,428 --> 01:40:37,588
Ka-kui, what's going on?

1432
01:40:38,196 --> 01:40:41,256
We don't have much time. The money!

1433
01:40:49,374 --> 01:40:50,363
What are you doing?

1434
01:40:50,409 --> 01:40:51,000
Ka-kui!

1435
01:40:51,043 --> 01:40:53,170
Move and I'll shoot you.

1436
01:40:53,545 --> 01:40:54,671
Don't pull the trigger.

1437
01:40:56,081 --> 01:40:57,070
No!

1438
01:40:57,315 --> 01:40:58,304
Don't push me.

1439
01:40:59,551 --> 01:41:02,418
If you shoot me, everybody here...

1440
01:41:03,321 --> 01:41:04,549
will be blown sky high.

1441
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:10,887
If one wire breaks,
the whole thing will explode.

1442
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:13,793
Ka-kui, what's going on?

1443
01:41:14,066 --> 01:41:15,863
Can't we work this out?

1444
01:41:16,068 --> 01:41:18,229
If I don't leave here in 10 minutes,
it will go off.

1445
01:41:18,570 --> 01:41:20,231
I don't have time!

1446
01:41:33,218 --> 01:41:34,207
Let him go. Please leave us.

1447
01:41:38,990 --> 01:41:39,979
Attention all units,

1448
01:41:40,358 --> 01:41:41,882
don't stop Ka-kui.

1449
01:41:53,605 --> 01:41:55,095
Ka-kui...

1450
01:41:55,373 --> 01:41:56,362
Don't follow me.

1451
01:41:58,276 --> 01:42:01,370
Ka-kui...

1452
01:42:01,546 --> 01:42:02,535
Get out of my way!

1453
01:42:14,459 --> 01:42:15,448
I think he did it.

1454
01:42:15,494 --> 01:42:16,483
Great.

1455
01:42:18,330 --> 01:42:19,319
Looks like he was followed.

1456
01:42:19,364 --> 01:42:20,353
Let's go.

1457
01:42:45,257 --> 01:42:46,349
Tell him to move up.

1458
01:42:54,432 --> 01:42:55,421
Give me the money.

1459
01:42:55,467 --> 01:42:58,129
I'm being followed.
Let me shake them off first.

1460
01:42:58,970 --> 01:42:59,959
Believe me.

1461
01:43:09,181 --> 01:43:10,170
Are the cops behind us?

1462
01:43:20,625 --> 01:43:21,785
Stay back! Don't come near.

1463
01:43:32,537 --> 01:43:33,663
Why did you stop here?

1464
01:43:39,211 --> 01:43:40,701
What are you doing?

1465
01:43:40,779 --> 01:43:41,768
What's going on?

1466
01:43:41,813 --> 01:43:43,405
A bomb's about to blow. Run!

1467
01:43:43,949 --> 01:43:45,576
A bomb! Run!

1468
01:44:06,271 --> 01:44:07,260
There's no cops!

1469
01:44:07,405 --> 01:44:08,963
I'll blow him to bits.

1470
01:44:09,241 --> 01:44:11,266
Wait! What about the money?

1471
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:14,210
And you can't get a radio signal
in the tunnel.

1472
01:44:14,613 --> 01:44:15,602
What now?

1473
01:44:15,647 --> 01:44:17,808
We've got the girl. Don't worry.
Let's go.

1474
01:44:18,049 --> 01:44:19,038
Maybe we should split up.

1475
01:45:55,714 --> 01:45:56,703
Kill her if it goes wrong.

1476
01:46:57,242 --> 01:46:58,231
May.

1477
01:47:04,983 --> 01:47:06,041
Where is she?

1478
01:47:28,673 --> 01:47:29,662
Look, he's back.

1479
01:47:34,813 --> 01:47:36,337
I told you he wouldn't play tricks.

1480
01:47:58,903 --> 01:47:59,892
May!

1481
01:48:06,077 --> 01:48:07,066
Quiet.

1482
01:48:16,754 --> 01:48:18,847
Freeze! You're under arrest.

1483
01:48:19,991 --> 01:48:21,822
Really?

1484
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:24,123
Come on then, arrest us.

1485
01:48:24,696 --> 01:48:25,685
Don't move.

1486
01:48:26,498 --> 01:48:27,487
Move and I'll shoot you.

1487
01:48:29,501 --> 01:48:31,992
You think so? You'd have to shoot fast.

1488
01:48:32,604 --> 01:48:33,798
There are three of us.

1489
01:48:34,672 --> 01:48:35,661
Think about it.

1490
01:48:35,707 --> 01:48:37,732
If I don't shoot you,
you'll only spend years in jail.

1491
01:48:37,976 --> 01:48:39,000
And then you'll be a reformed person.

1492
01:48:39,344 --> 01:48:40,811
That's better than dying in this condition.

1493
01:48:43,915 --> 01:48:44,904
We are ready.

1494
01:48:45,783 --> 01:48:47,011
We want to be rich.

1495
01:48:47,252 --> 01:48:48,549
Yes.

1496
01:48:49,187 --> 01:48:50,745
But you are way too cruel.

1497
01:48:50,989 --> 01:48:53,116
What is cruel?
Fortune Maker

1498
01:48:53,291 --> 01:48:55,623
In this society,
only if you do something good to the society,

1499
01:48:55,927 --> 01:48:58,088
everyone will help you.
You will be repaid.

1500
01:48:58,229 --> 01:48:59,218
Then you will be rich.

1501
01:49:01,299 --> 01:49:03,529
And you will have new outlook.
That's what you could do.

1502
01:49:03,902 --> 01:49:05,028
Yet, now what you have done,

1503
01:49:05,270 --> 01:49:06,635
has harmed the society.

1504
01:49:06,938 --> 01:49:07,927
This is against everyone's benefit.

1505
01:49:08,239 --> 01:49:09,604
What does that mean?

1506
01:49:09,674 --> 01:49:10,663
Look.

1507
01:49:10,708 --> 01:49:11,470
Beside you guys,

1508
01:49:11,509 --> 01:49:12,601
who will think you are doing the right thing?

1509
01:49:12,810 --> 01:49:14,107
Who would think of your purpose?

1510
01:49:17,148 --> 01:49:18,342
You are right.

1511
01:49:18,917 --> 01:49:22,409
Yes.

1512
01:49:23,321 --> 01:49:24,345
That doesn't sound too bad,

1513
01:49:24,589 --> 01:49:27,023
we might take your advice.

1514
01:49:27,825 --> 01:49:28,883
But we're still young.

1515
01:49:29,561 --> 01:49:30,926
After we did our time, we'd all be old men.

1516
01:49:33,331 --> 01:49:34,320
Don't push me!

1517
01:49:34,532 --> 01:49:36,500
Run! This is a fireworks factory.

1518
01:51:59,444 --> 01:52:00,433
May!

1519
01:52:00,478 --> 01:52:01,467
I'm over here!

1520
01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:03,269
Are you all right?

1521
01:52:10,321 --> 01:52:11,549
Ka-kui, be careful!

1522
01:52:35,379 --> 01:52:36,368
Good work!

1523
01:52:46,023 --> 01:52:47,012
Ka-kui! Come here!

1524
01:52:47,125 --> 01:52:48,114
There's the rubbish chute.

1525
01:53:01,539 --> 01:53:02,528
There's an exit.

1526
01:53:05,443 --> 01:53:06,432
May, you go first.

1527
01:53:12,884 --> 01:53:13,873
It looks too high.

1528
01:53:14,385 --> 01:53:15,784
Just jump.

1529
01:53:37,308 --> 01:53:38,297
Ka-kui, are you all right?

1530
01:53:40,111 --> 01:53:42,477
I'm fine. Get out of here, May.
As far as you can.

1531
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:43,669
Be careful.

1532
01:55:59,016 --> 01:56:00,040
Dad.

1533
01:56:00,251 --> 01:56:02,412
Do you want to try this yourself?

1534
01:56:02,687 --> 01:56:04,484
You want some more? Take this.

1535
01:56:05,856 --> 01:56:06,948
And more, bastard.

1536
01:56:07,158 --> 01:56:08,785
Want some more?

1537
01:56:09,160 --> 01:56:11,390
You want some more? Here!

1538
01:56:12,496 --> 01:56:18,457
Bastard!

1539
01:56:18,769 --> 01:56:25,607
More?

1540
01:57:06,083 --> 01:57:07,072
Shit. Not enough...

1541
01:57:55,199 --> 01:57:56,530
Ka-kui!

1542
01:58:05,910 --> 01:58:06,899
Stop crying, OK?

1543
01:58:08,012 --> 01:58:10,503
Look, the fireworks are beautiful.
