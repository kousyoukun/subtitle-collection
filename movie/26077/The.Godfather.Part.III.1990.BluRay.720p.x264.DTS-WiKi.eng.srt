1
00:01:51,524 --> 00:01:53,549
My dear children...

2
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,857
it is now better
than several years...

3
00:01:56,963 --> 00:01:59,124
since I moved to New York...

4
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:01,928
and I haven't seen you
as much as I would like to.

5
00:02:03,536 --> 00:02:07,563
I hope you will come
to this ceremony of papal honors...

6
00:02:07,674 --> 00:02:09,562
given for my charitable work.

7
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:15,469
The only wealth
in this world is children.

8
00:02:15,582 --> 00:02:19,541
More than all the money,
power on earth...

9
00:02:19,652 --> 00:02:21,540
you are my treasure.

10
00:02:23,756 --> 00:02:26,088
Anthony and Mary...

11
00:02:26,192 --> 00:02:28,524
although I entrusted
your education to your mother...

12
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:30,994
for your own best interests...

13
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:33,588
you know how I look forward
to seeing you...

14
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,760
and to a new period
of harmony in our lives.

15
00:02:38,204 --> 00:02:40,764
Perhaps you might
prevail upon your mother...

16
00:02:40,874 --> 00:02:43,172
to come to this celebration...

17
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:45,801
and that from time to time...

18
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:49,700
we can all see each other
at family functions.

19
00:02:49,816 --> 00:02:54,480
Anyway, I remain,
your loving father.

20
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,380
Hail Mary, full of grace...

21
00:03:30,256 --> 00:03:32,247
blessed art Thou amongst women...

22
00:03:33,626 --> 00:03:37,722
and blessed is the fruit
of Thy womb,Jesus.

23
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,663
Holy Mary, mother of God...

24
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:43,133
pray for us sinners--

25
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:10,082
Almighty God,
bless the insignia...

26
00:04:10,196 --> 00:04:12,756
of Saint Sebastian the Martyr...

27
00:04:12,865 --> 00:04:17,154
that it may contribute
to the sacredness of him...

28
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,192
to whom it is given.

29
00:04:31,618 --> 00:04:33,506
Do you, Michael...

30
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,748
promise to be faithful
to the noble purposes...

31
00:04:36,856 --> 00:04:38,778
of this order...

32
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:42,019
to have a special care
for the poor, the needy...

33
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:43,891
and those who are ill?

34
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:45,794
l do so promise.

35
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,136
May the blessing
of Almighty God--

36
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:09,210
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit--

37
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:13,486
descend upon you
and remain with you...

38
00:05:13,593 --> 00:05:14,958
forever.

39
00:05:15,061 --> 00:05:16,688
Amen.

40
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:50,079
Vincent, our name's
not on the list.

41
00:06:53,626 --> 00:06:54,923
Write it in.

42
00:06:55,027 --> 00:06:57,518
Mancini. M-A-N-C-l-N-l.

43
00:06:59,298 --> 00:07:01,926
- ls there a problem?
- My name's not on the list.

44
00:07:02,034 --> 00:07:04,457
Then you have to
leave immediately.

45
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,868
- No two ways about it.
- You want to dance?

46
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:09,669
Joe, it's Vinnie.
lt's okay. These are our guests.

47
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,909
l'm sorry, Dave.

48
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:14,900
lt's all right.
Vinnie, welcome to the party.

49
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:09,233
Good to see you.

50
00:08:09,335 --> 00:08:12,190
lt's good to see you again.
This is my husband.

51
00:08:12,305 --> 00:08:14,193
This is my son, Anthony.

52
00:08:15,308 --> 00:08:18,197
The order of Saint Sebastian
is one of the highest honors...

53
00:08:18,311 --> 00:08:20,336
the Catholic Church
can bestow upon a layman.

54
00:08:20,446 --> 00:08:23,244
The award was first granted
by Pope Gregory--

55
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:26,273
What about Mr. Corleone's connections
with Las Vegas gambling?

56
00:08:26,385 --> 00:08:28,717
Press kits have pictures--

57
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:30,982
How about his involvement
with the underworld?

58
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,580
Cut the crap, huh?

59
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:35,923
The pope,
the Holy Father himself...

60
00:08:36,028 --> 00:08:38,724
has this very day
blessed Michael Corleone.

61
00:08:38,831 --> 00:08:40,719
You think you know
better than the pope?

62
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,721
- Do it, do it.
- Vincent!

63
00:08:42,835 --> 00:08:45,224
- Yes?
- She loves you.

64
00:08:50,343 --> 00:08:51,833
- What'd he say?
- l love you too.

65
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,477
Hi, Vincent.
l remember you.

66
00:09:02,655 --> 00:09:04,179
You remember me?
From where?

67
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,679
When we were at
a party together.

68
00:09:06,792 --> 00:09:08,680
Did you come to the club?

69
00:09:08,794 --> 00:09:11,285
- No, it was a wedding.
- A wedding?

70
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:15,890
l was eight, and you were 1 5.

71
00:09:16,002 --> 00:09:19,028
l had a lot of girlfriends
when l was 1 5.

72
00:09:19,138 --> 00:09:21,333
- Eight-year-olds?
- Especially eight-year-olds.

73
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:25,603
Where's Mary?

74
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:28,100
Would somebody please hail Mary?

75
00:09:28,214 --> 00:09:30,409
Excuse me, Your Excellency.

76
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:33,440
You know, you haven't
kissed me hello yet.

77
00:09:33,552 --> 00:09:36,680
- Relatives always kiss.
- Oh, now we're related?

78
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:39,314
l'm your little cousin.

79
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:48,061
Who's your father?

80
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:50,863
l'll give you a hint.

81
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,495
- He's ltalian.
- Mary.

82
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:56,461
Mary, we've been
waiting for you.

83
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:58,668
Remember...

84
00:09:58,778 --> 00:10:00,575
keep your voice low.

85
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,205
Smile. Don't forget to smile.

86
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:22,764
Carissimi Amici...

87
00:10:22,868 --> 00:10:24,756
the honorary chairman...

88
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,134
of the Vito Corleone
Foundation...

89
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:29,867
my daughter, Mary Corleone.

90
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:40,573
Thanks.

91
00:10:42,254 --> 00:10:46,179
l think l inherited my father's love
for speechmaking...

92
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:47,725
but here it goes.

93
00:10:48,894 --> 00:10:50,782
The Vito Corleone Foundation...

94
00:10:50,896 --> 00:10:53,490
helps the impoverished
of every country...

95
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:55,988
gives grants to artists...

96
00:10:56,102 --> 00:10:58,400
funds medical research...

97
00:10:58,504 --> 00:11:03,237
and is particularly dedicated
to the resurrection of Sicily.

98
00:11:03,342 --> 00:11:05,674
Archbishop Gilday...

99
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:10,203
here is $ 1 00 million
for the poor of Sicily...

100
00:11:10,316 --> 00:11:12,511
in the name of Vito Corleone.

101
00:11:12,618 --> 00:11:15,416
Don't spend it all in one place.

102
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:39,136
l'm so proud of you.

103
00:11:47,219 --> 00:11:50,643
You've done a wonderful thing
for Sicily.

104
00:11:50,756 --> 00:11:54,783
Let's just hope the money
gets to the people who need it.

105
00:11:54,894 --> 00:11:58,660
- Amen.
- But the most important part--

106
00:11:58,764 --> 00:12:00,686
Johnny Fontane!

107
00:12:09,642 --> 00:12:11,405
Thank you very much.

108
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,399
l'm happy to be here with you,
and l'd like you to join me...

109
00:12:14,513 --> 00:12:18,142
in honoring
commendatore Michael Corleone.

110
00:12:22,588 --> 00:12:25,978
l have something special
for our host and godfather.

111
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:28,617
l just happen to know
his favorite song.

112
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:30,649
Michael, where are you going?
lt's your favorite song.

113
00:12:30,763 --> 00:12:34,187
l'm off here to the kitchen
to hear some Tony Bennett records.

114
00:12:35,935 --> 00:12:38,267
It's your favorite song.
It's salsiccia's own.

115
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,201
We're getting
a salsiccia sandwich.

116
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:41,739
l'll be back.

117
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:48,967
A rose must remain

118
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:51,641
With the sun and the rain

119
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:56,540
Or its lovely promise
won't come true

120
00:12:57,723 --> 00:13:00,487
To each his own

121
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:04,723
To each his own

122
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:08,425
And my own is you

123
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:18,200
Hello, Kay.

124
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:31,114
Congratulations, Michael.
That's really quite an honor.

125
00:13:31,223 --> 00:13:34,147
lt's a little expensive,
wouldn't you say?

126
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:38,751
Cake?

127
00:13:38,864 --> 00:13:40,525
No, thank you.

128
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,069
- Been a long time, hasn't it?
- Yeah.

129
00:13:57,183 --> 00:13:59,572
Eight years.

130
00:13:59,685 --> 00:14:01,573
You look wonderful.

131
00:14:05,357 --> 00:14:07,723
Your son has something
he wants to talk to you about.

132
00:14:07,826 --> 00:14:10,158
l came here for him.

133
00:14:12,631 --> 00:14:14,519
Nice to see you.
Thank you.

134
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:21,771
If a flame is to grow

135
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:25,230
There must be a glow

136
00:14:25,344 --> 00:14:27,938
To open each door

137
00:14:28,047 --> 00:14:30,777
There's a key

138
00:14:30,883 --> 00:14:33,738
I need you, I know

139
00:14:33,852 --> 00:14:36,480
I can't let you go

140
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,490
- What's wrong with being a lawyer?
- Nothing, except he doesn't want it.

141
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,489
He wants his life
to be in music.

142
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,259
Music is great.
l love music...

143
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:56,762
but he should finish
what he started.

144
00:14:58,143 --> 00:15:01,476
- l'm going my own way.
- Your own way?

145
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,207
- Professional singer?
- That's right.

146
00:15:03,315 --> 00:15:06,739
And what happens if you fail?

147
00:15:06,852 --> 00:15:08,774
l won't fail.

148
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:11,219
- Men always believe that.
- l know.

149
00:15:11,323 --> 00:15:13,211
lf you have a law degree...

150
00:15:13,325 --> 00:15:15,213
you're taking out
insurance.

151
00:15:15,327 --> 00:15:17,352
After that, you can do anything--
work for me--

152
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:19,658
l will never work for you.

153
00:15:19,765 --> 00:15:21,596
l have bad memories.

154
00:15:24,036 --> 00:15:26,664
Every family has bad memories.

155
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:32,569
l will always be your son...

156
00:15:32,678 --> 00:15:37,240
but l will never have anything
to do with your business.

157
00:15:37,349 --> 00:15:41,206
Anthony, finish the law degree.

158
00:16:00,873 --> 00:16:05,196
That he got from you,
that ''no.''

159
00:16:08,013 --> 00:16:11,210
You could have helped me
to convince him, Kay.

160
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:13,205
Oh, yeah.
Convince him of what?

161
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:15,810
Of what?

162
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:18,652
He throws his life away.

163
00:16:18,757 --> 00:16:20,713
He throws greatness away.

164
00:16:21,794 --> 00:16:24,752
This is greatness?

165
00:16:24,863 --> 00:16:26,751
Now that you're
so respectable...

166
00:16:26,865 --> 00:16:29,231
l think you're more dangerous
than you ever were.

167
00:16:29,335 --> 00:16:31,291
ln fact, l preferred you
when you were just...

168
00:16:31,403 --> 00:16:33,735
a common Mafia hood.

169
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:40,565
- Now can we talk common sense here?
- All right.

170
00:16:47,386 --> 00:16:50,344
Tony knows that you killed Fredo.

171
00:16:56,628 --> 00:16:59,984
- What did you come here for?
- To protect my son.

172
00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:02,693
l didn't come to see you disguised
by your church.

173
00:17:02,801 --> 00:17:05,190
l think that was
a shameful ceremony.

174
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:12,273
l spent my life
protecting my son.

175
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:16,269
l spent my life
protecting my family!

176
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:19,271
Let's be reasonable.

177
00:17:19,385 --> 00:17:23,173
That's your big thing,
isn't it, Michael?

178
00:17:23,288 --> 00:17:27,452
Reason backed up by murder.

179
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:29,220
Oh, God.

180
00:17:30,496 --> 00:17:33,056
God, you hate me. You hate me.

181
00:17:33,832 --> 00:17:35,925
l don't hate you.

182
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:38,568
l dread you.

183
00:17:42,975 --> 00:17:46,399
l did what l could, Kay, to protect...

184
00:17:46,512 --> 00:17:49,174
all of you from the horrors
of this world.

185
00:17:50,582 --> 00:17:52,470
But you became my horror.

186
00:18:02,261 --> 00:18:04,593
Our children still love you, though.

187
00:18:04,696 --> 00:18:06,391
Especially Mary.

188
00:18:09,101 --> 00:18:10,659
That's something.

189
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:17,027
We can build on that,
for their sake.

190
00:18:20,813 --> 00:18:22,440
Let's try.

191
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:25,779
Only if you let Tony go free
to have his own life...

192
00:18:26,885 --> 00:18:28,011
away from you.

193
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,148
l'll let Tony go.

194
00:18:39,665 --> 00:18:41,292
Thank you.

195
00:19:19,872 --> 00:19:21,794
You could hurt somebody
with those.

196
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,164
Let me show you around.

197
00:19:25,277 --> 00:19:27,643
Can you get me an interview
with Michael Corleone?

198
00:19:27,746 --> 00:19:30,601
No. l'm a relative,
but l can't do that.

199
00:19:30,716 --> 00:19:33,344
What else could l do for you?

200
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:36,046
- Handsome but useless.
- Oh, yeah?

201
00:19:36,154 --> 00:19:39,351
- That's okay. l'll gamble.
- You like to gamble?

202
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:43,485
Let's go to Atlantic City. lt's my town.
l'll show you how to gamble.

203
00:19:43,595 --> 00:19:45,961
How will l know
what numbers to bet?

204
00:19:46,064 --> 00:19:47,827
Do l look like a loser?

205
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:49,423
Well--

206
00:19:51,837 --> 00:19:54,260
That's a spooky-looking
guy there.

207
00:19:54,373 --> 00:19:57,900
What's a guy like that doing
at Michael Corleone's house?

208
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,342
- That's Joey Zasa's bulldog.
- You know that guy?

209
00:20:00,445 --> 00:20:02,572
Yeah, l know that guy.

210
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:05,570
That guy's name
is Anthony Squigiliaro.

211
00:20:05,684 --> 00:20:07,606
They call him ''the Ant.''

212
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:11,052
He dips his bullets in cyanide.

213
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:20,960
Don Altobello.

214
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:24,990
l come to pay my respects.

215
00:20:29,508 --> 00:20:31,931
You honor my father's friendship.

216
00:20:32,044 --> 00:20:34,205
Where is my goddaughter?

217
00:20:38,884 --> 00:20:43,150
lt was not so long ago
l held you in these old hands.

218
00:20:48,627 --> 00:20:51,255
No, no.
l stand. l stand.

219
00:20:51,363 --> 00:20:54,787
Michael, l lost
all the venom...

220
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,788
all the juice of youth.

221
00:20:56,902 --> 00:20:58,927
l lost the lust
for women...

222
00:20:59,037 --> 00:21:02,529
and now my mind is clear.

223
00:21:02,641 --> 00:21:05,530
My duty to God is clear.

224
00:21:05,644 --> 00:21:09,034
l have a special favor to ask.

225
00:21:10,716 --> 00:21:14,948
Can l attach my name...

226
00:21:15,053 --> 00:21:17,942
to the Vito Corleone Foundation...

227
00:21:18,056 --> 00:21:20,786
so that you and l can be joined...

228
00:21:20,892 --> 00:21:23,588
in name and spirit?

229
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:27,626
One million dollars.

230
00:21:33,772 --> 00:21:36,195
- Godfather.
- Don Altobello...

231
00:21:36,308 --> 00:21:38,196
you have such a heart.

232
00:21:40,712 --> 00:21:43,340
Come, let's go
and sample some of it.

233
00:21:51,556 --> 00:21:55,048
The Vatican knows nothing
about these shareholders.

234
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,550
Good.
l have a tendency to worry.

235
00:21:58,664 --> 00:22:01,462
We've increased our position
substantially...

236
00:22:01,566 --> 00:22:02,726
and naturally, l worry.

237
00:22:02,834 --> 00:22:04,461
Come along now.
Stop worrying.

238
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:06,958
We have an agreement.

239
00:22:07,072 --> 00:22:09,734
Good. How do you think
l got this gray hair?

240
00:22:09,841 --> 00:22:11,138
Mr. Corleone.

241
00:22:11,243 --> 00:22:13,302
- Two seconds.
- Frank, how are you?

242
00:22:13,412 --> 00:22:15,903
Thanks for your swimming pool
contribution...

243
00:22:16,014 --> 00:22:20,246
and we need your help on
Sam Wallace's candidacy for a judgeship.

244
00:22:20,352 --> 00:22:22,582
- We always can use a good judge.
- Thank you.

245
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:24,553
Andrew.

246
00:22:24,656 --> 00:22:26,988
Excellency, my godson,
Andrew Hagen...

247
00:22:27,092 --> 00:22:28,980
my brother Tom Hagen's
eldest boy...

248
00:22:29,094 --> 00:22:32,484
and he's been assistant
to Bishop Breelan three years now.

249
00:22:32,597 --> 00:22:34,929
He's hoping for
a Vatican assignment.

250
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:37,627
There's always a place in Rome
for a fine priest.

251
00:22:37,736 --> 00:22:40,159
His mother, Theresa Hagen.
Bishop Gilday.

252
00:22:40,272 --> 00:22:42,934
Thank you.
lt's an honor to meet you.

253
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:47,501
Mr. Corleone, hi.
Grace Hamilton.

254
00:22:47,612 --> 00:22:50,103
Vincent Mancini promised
he'd tell you about me...

255
00:22:50,182 --> 00:22:52,446
that maybe you'd see me.

256
00:22:52,551 --> 00:22:54,314
Vincent Mancini call about her?

257
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:55,818
No.

258
00:22:55,921 --> 00:22:58,253
Grace, you promised me
you'd stay up there.

259
00:22:58,356 --> 00:23:00,221
- l know.
- Twice.

260
00:23:01,226 --> 00:23:05,048
Joey Zasa showed up.
We got him waiting in the lobby.

261
00:23:05,163 --> 00:23:09,190
Says he wants to personally
congratulate you and show his respect.

262
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:11,223
Do l have to see him?

263
00:23:11,336 --> 00:23:14,533
He says you're his padrone
and he only wants a minute.

264
00:23:18,076 --> 00:23:20,806
Hey, Vinnie.

265
00:23:20,912 --> 00:23:23,073
- Who's your favorite aunt?
- You are.

266
00:23:26,184 --> 00:23:30,348
Today l'm going to talk to Michael
about your problem.

267
00:23:30,455 --> 00:23:33,185
l wish you would have warned me, Con.
l could have worn a better suit.

268
00:23:35,193 --> 00:23:38,219
The Meucci Association
has elected you...

269
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:41,185
their ltalian-American
man of the year.

270
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,997
Hey, Meucci.

271
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:48,495
Who's Meucci?

272
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:52,241
He's the ltalian-American
who invented the telephone.

273
00:23:52,344 --> 00:23:55,734
He did it one year before
Alexander Graham Bell.

274
00:23:55,847 --> 00:23:57,769
Really? Huh.

275
00:23:59,818 --> 00:24:02,776
And this is the reason
you've come to my home?

276
00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:16,860
l got a stone in my shoe,
Mr. Corleone.

277
00:24:18,103 --> 00:24:21,197
A two-bit punk
who works for me...

278
00:24:21,306 --> 00:24:23,399
the one who...

279
00:24:23,508 --> 00:24:25,499
thinks he's related to you.

280
00:24:27,312 --> 00:24:29,200
A bastard.

281
00:24:32,551 --> 00:24:35,679
He's here.
Vincent Mancini.

282
00:24:35,787 --> 00:24:37,118
He's at the party.

283
00:24:40,292 --> 00:24:42,157
Bring him in.

284
00:24:43,428 --> 00:24:46,784
l think it's good we talk.

285
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:53,001
l have a problem...

286
00:24:53,104 --> 00:24:57,268
and l want to find out
if it is my problem...

287
00:24:57,375 --> 00:24:59,502
or your problem.

288
00:24:59,611 --> 00:25:01,533
Your business is your business.

289
00:25:01,646 --> 00:25:03,978
l have no interest
in percentages.

290
00:25:04,082 --> 00:25:05,242
l'm out.

291
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,046
Good.

292
00:25:08,153 --> 00:25:10,041
Then it's my problem.

293
00:25:13,491 --> 00:25:17,655
Michael, you know
Vincent Mancini, Sonny's boy.

294
00:25:20,065 --> 00:25:22,124
How you doing, Mr. Corleone?

295
00:25:22,234 --> 00:25:24,429
- How you doing?
- Good. How you doing?

296
00:25:24,536 --> 00:25:26,094
- Good.
- Good party.

297
00:25:26,204 --> 00:25:28,297
- Oh, you like it.
- Yeah. l had to sneak in.

298
00:25:28,406 --> 00:25:30,294
You're dressed for it.

299
00:25:34,846 --> 00:25:35,938
So...

300
00:25:36,047 --> 00:25:39,210
what's the trouble
between you and Mr.Joe Zasa?

301
00:25:41,152 --> 00:25:43,040
Just trouble.
l'll take care of it.

302
00:25:43,154 --> 00:25:47,250
- That's foolish of you.
- Foolish of me?

303
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:49,520
lt's foolish of this guy,
don't you think?

304
00:25:49,628 --> 00:25:51,858
Right?

305
00:25:51,963 --> 00:25:53,885
Right?

306
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:56,024
Temper like his father.

307
00:25:56,134 --> 00:25:57,692
Vincent...

308
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:01,801
Mr.Joe Zasa now owns
what used to be...

309
00:26:01,907 --> 00:26:04,671
the Corleone family
business in New York.

310
00:26:04,776 --> 00:26:09,008
Out of the kindness of his heart,
he gave you a job in his family.

311
00:26:09,114 --> 00:26:11,969
Contrary to my advice,
you took the job.

312
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:15,678
l offered you something better
in the legitimate world.

313
00:26:15,787 --> 00:26:17,186
You turned me down.

314
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:21,077
Now you both come to me
with this bad blood.

315
00:26:21,192 --> 00:26:22,989
What do you expect me to do?

316
00:26:23,094 --> 00:26:25,722
Am l a gangster?

317
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,752
- No. You're not a gangster.
- That was Papa's neighborhood.

318
00:26:27,866 --> 00:26:30,721
Now it's a sewer.
Zasa runs it like a disgrace.

319
00:26:30,835 --> 00:26:32,268
That's the past.

320
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,565
l earned that territory
with my talent.

321
00:26:34,673 --> 00:26:38,564
The commission gave it to me,
and you approved it.

322
00:26:38,677 --> 00:26:42,238
- Yes.
- l came to the party.

323
00:26:42,347 --> 00:26:44,338
l'm not here for help.
l could kill this bastard.

324
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:47,282
- He needs the help.
- So kill him.

325
00:26:47,385 --> 00:26:50,843
What does all this
have to do with me?

326
00:26:50,956 --> 00:26:54,016
He's going around behind your back
saying, ''Fuck Michael Corleone.''

327
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:56,286
That's one thing
that has to do with you. Right?

328
00:26:56,394 --> 00:26:58,919
Say it to his face one time.
Just one time.

329
00:27:00,632 --> 00:27:03,590
Mr. Corleone,
all bastards are liars.

330
00:27:03,702 --> 00:27:08,332
- Shakespeare wrote poems about it.
- What am l gonna do with this guy?

331
00:27:16,915 --> 00:27:19,839
lf there is some guy
running around this city...

332
00:27:19,951 --> 00:27:22,317
saying, ''Fuck Michael Corleone''...

333
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:26,948
what do we do with a piece of shit
like that?

334
00:27:29,594 --> 00:27:31,084
He's a fucking dog.

335
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:42,160
Yes, it's true.
lf anyone would say such a thing...

336
00:27:42,273 --> 00:27:45,868
they would not be a friend,
they would be a dog.

337
00:27:51,983 --> 00:27:54,315
My interests don't conflict
with Mr.Joe Zasa's.

338
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:58,241
You don't know how much your interests
conflict with Zasa's, Uncle Michael.

339
00:27:58,356 --> 00:28:02,053
Wait.
He needs your support.

340
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,889
Don't let me work
for this guy no more.

341
00:28:03,995 --> 00:28:05,917
- Let me work for you.
- For me?

342
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:07,760
As what? Tough guy?

343
00:28:07,866 --> 00:28:09,754
l don't need tough guys.

344
00:28:09,868 --> 00:28:11,790
l need more lawyers.

345
00:28:14,305 --> 00:28:17,103
Since we have no
conflicts, no debts...

346
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:19,073
l accept your tribute.

347
00:28:19,177 --> 00:28:20,769
l wish you well.

348
00:28:22,347 --> 00:28:25,703
Vincent, make your peace
with Mr.Joe Zasa.

349
00:28:25,817 --> 00:28:27,216
Come on.

350
00:28:30,155 --> 00:28:31,850
Okay. Go on.

351
00:28:37,695 --> 00:28:40,220
Bastardo.

352
00:28:45,003 --> 00:28:47,494
For Christ's sakes, stop!
What's the matter with you?

353
00:28:47,605 --> 00:28:48,902
Get him out of here.

354
00:28:51,643 --> 00:28:54,032
Oh,Jesus.

355
00:28:54,145 --> 00:28:56,875
Uncle Michael, l told Connie
it wasn't the right time for this.

356
00:28:56,981 --> 00:29:00,144
- Close it.
- l know you're into banks and stocks.

357
00:29:00,251 --> 00:29:02,913
Everyone knows you're the final word,
like the Supreme Court.

358
00:29:03,021 --> 00:29:04,852
l want to protect you from these guys.
Your lawyers can't do that.

359
00:29:04,956 --> 00:29:06,947
- And you can?
- Yeah, l can do that.

360
00:29:09,427 --> 00:29:11,349
Why should l be
afraid of Joe Zasa?

361
00:29:11,463 --> 00:29:14,660
He knows you're stopping him
from rising up in the commission.

362
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:17,860
l say we make him dead.
Give me the order, l'll take care of it.

363
00:29:17,969 --> 00:29:20,199
- You'll take care of it?
- Yeah.

364
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:26,772
Maybe you should come with me...

365
00:29:26,878 --> 00:29:29,369
for a few weeks,
see what happens.

366
00:29:30,648 --> 00:29:32,570
See if you learn.

367
00:29:33,551 --> 00:29:36,907
Then we'll talk
about your future.

368
00:29:37,856 --> 00:29:39,744
l won't let you down.

369
00:29:46,064 --> 00:29:47,952
We're just about ready.

370
00:29:54,272 --> 00:29:56,763
- So what happened?
- What happened?

371
00:29:56,841 --> 00:29:59,469
They put me in a room with Zasa,
what's gonna happen? l bit his ear off.

372
00:29:59,577 --> 00:30:03,001
Here we go.
Watch the card.

373
00:30:03,114 --> 00:30:05,674
- There.
- Hold it.

374
00:30:05,783 --> 00:30:08,581
l'll just change
the plate here.

375
00:30:08,686 --> 00:30:10,711
Vincent.

376
00:30:10,822 --> 00:30:13,518
Take the picture with us.
Come on.

377
00:30:20,365 --> 00:30:23,493
- Nice jacket.
- Little girl--

378
00:30:23,601 --> 00:30:26,559
Closer to the center,
if you would, sir.

379
00:30:26,671 --> 00:30:28,400
And here we go.

380
00:30:28,506 --> 00:30:31,566
Ready. Smile.

381
00:30:31,676 --> 00:30:34,236
Excellent.
l'll have it for you on Monday.

382
00:30:49,027 --> 00:30:50,426
Butter cake.
Beautiful.

383
00:30:50,528 --> 00:30:53,190
Godfather, this is the cake
for you and your family...

384
00:30:53,298 --> 00:30:56,461
from Enzo the baker.

385
00:30:56,568 --> 00:30:58,593
Want to do it?
All right.

386
00:31:38,142 --> 00:31:39,575
You lead.

387
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,177
Kathryn, you lead.

388
00:32:47,312 --> 00:32:50,475
- Vincent?
- What do you want, sweetheart?

389
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,438
Do you love me?

390
00:32:55,687 --> 00:32:58,281
- Come on. Go to bed.
- Come on. Say it.

391
00:32:58,389 --> 00:33:00,186
- Go to bed.
- No. Say it.

392
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:02,623
l love you.
l love you.

393
00:33:02,727 --> 00:33:04,558
l love you too.

394
00:33:07,231 --> 00:33:09,222
You got a cat?

395
00:33:15,673 --> 00:33:18,233
Go get us some water,
would you? l'm thirsty.

396
00:33:19,644 --> 00:33:21,202
Come on.

397
00:33:28,453 --> 00:33:30,250
Well, l just guess
l know my place.

398
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:35,680
l can't believe l'm actually
getting up to do this.

399
00:33:35,793 --> 00:33:39,024
''Get me water. Bake me a cake.''
Whatever happened to ''please''?

400
00:34:26,711 --> 00:34:27,643
Come on.

401
00:34:27,745 --> 00:34:30,543
Good boy, Sockface.
Let's go for a walk.

402
00:34:39,023 --> 00:34:40,081
Let her go.

403
00:34:40,191 --> 00:34:42,421
Fuck it.
Cut her throat, man.

404
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:47,318
- What'd you say?
- l said, cut her fucking throat.

405
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:51,932
Let her go.

406
00:34:52,036 --> 00:34:53,992
Drop your gun,
or he'll cut her throat.

407
00:34:54,105 --> 00:34:56,096
l hardly know this broad.

408
00:34:56,207 --> 00:34:58,095
Go ahead and cut her.
What the fuck do l care?

409
00:35:00,545 --> 00:35:03,810
You got no choice, man.
This chick's gonna be dead.

410
00:35:03,915 --> 00:35:06,770
Hurt her,
l'll kill you both.

411
00:35:06,884 --> 00:35:10,274
- Give up that knife, l'll let you go.
- You cut her throat right now.

412
00:35:12,123 --> 00:35:13,852
l'll do something to convince you.
Don't get frightened.

413
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:16,188
Don't do any sudden movements.
Just watch me, all right?

414
00:35:16,294 --> 00:35:17,886
- Hear me?
- Yeah.

415
00:35:21,399 --> 00:35:23,526
Oh, shit!

416
00:35:25,636 --> 00:35:28,025
Drop the knife.
Go ahead. Drop it!

417
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:30,130
Good boy.

418
00:35:30,241 --> 00:35:32,129
Sit down.
l want to talk to you.

419
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:34,973
lt's a wise choice. Sit down.
l want to talk to you.

420
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:37,070
Lose the mask.

421
00:35:39,917 --> 00:35:41,612
Relax. Have a smoke.
You smoke?

422
00:35:44,655 --> 00:35:46,543
Whose idea was this?

423
00:35:46,657 --> 00:35:48,454
Who sent you?

424
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:51,255
Come on. Tell me.
Who sent you?

425
00:35:53,431 --> 00:35:56,093
- No one.
- Take a good look at this guy?

426
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,623
- Yeah.
- So who sent you?

427
00:36:01,405 --> 00:36:03,669
lt was Joey.
Joey Zasa.

428
00:36:18,256 --> 00:36:19,814
You okay?

429
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:26,223
- You were going to let them kill me!
- l wasn't gonna let that happen.

430
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:30,926
You pig!
You sick fuck!

431
00:36:31,035 --> 00:36:33,401
Come on, sweetheart, that's gambling.
You wanted gambling? That's gambling.

432
00:36:33,504 --> 00:36:35,392
Call the police.

433
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:43,603
- You killed the other guy too?
- He went for my gun.

434
00:36:43,714 --> 00:36:47,138
lt's self-defense, justifiable homicide.
Go ahead. Call the police.

435
00:36:48,152 --> 00:36:50,245
- Where are you going? Oh, no.
- l'm going to take pictures first.

436
00:36:50,354 --> 00:36:52,413
No pictures.

437
00:36:53,858 --> 00:36:55,189
You had a gun.

438
00:36:55,293 --> 00:36:57,249
They only had a knife.

439
00:36:57,361 --> 00:37:00,455
You could have talked them into
surrendering, handed them to the police.

440
00:37:00,565 --> 00:37:04,558
Zasa sent these guys.
l just sent him a message, that's all.

441
00:37:05,436 --> 00:37:08,928
- Now he has to send you a message back.
- He's gotta send me a message back?

442
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,929
- Zasa's going to send a message?
- He did the right thing.

443
00:37:12,043 --> 00:37:15,274
- He got Zasa's name.
- What does he got to do with it?

444
00:37:15,379 --> 00:37:18,644
Joey Zasa's a pazzo.
Joey Zasa.

445
00:37:20,918 --> 00:37:23,842
All right.
You are what you are.

446
00:37:23,955 --> 00:37:27,311
lt's your nature.
Stay close to me.

447
00:37:27,425 --> 00:37:29,120
You don't do anything.

448
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:31,217
Keep your mouth shut
and your eyes open.

449
00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:34,594
- Do what l tell you. Understand?
- l understand.

450
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:37,088
l got problems
with the commission.

451
00:37:37,201 --> 00:37:39,931
- l know.
- Yes. You don't make them easier.

452
00:37:40,037 --> 00:37:43,700
l understand that.
lt wasn't my idea that this happened.

453
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,332
All right. Go on.
Get out of here.

454
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,439
Now they'll fear you.

455
00:37:51,549 --> 00:37:53,642
Maybe they
should fear you.

456
00:37:57,221 --> 00:37:59,143
BJ, excuse me.
What's up?

457
00:37:59,256 --> 00:38:01,315
The archbishop just called back.

458
00:38:01,425 --> 00:38:04,349
We've arranged
some amazing things for you.

459
00:38:04,462 --> 00:38:05,952
The publicity is phenomenal.

460
00:38:06,063 --> 00:38:08,395
You're the new Rockefeller,
a philanthropist.

461
00:38:10,701 --> 00:38:14,330
- Sign right here, please.
- Times do change, don't they?

462
00:38:14,438 --> 00:38:17,771
My father hated foundations.

463
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:21,333
He loved doing it
by himself, man to man.

464
00:38:21,445 --> 00:38:23,072
But we're different, huh?

465
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:26,104
lt's no different than
any large corporation.

466
00:38:26,217 --> 00:38:28,583
You control a lot of money
with very little...

467
00:38:28,686 --> 00:38:30,574
minimize taxes...

468
00:38:30,688 --> 00:38:33,077
with no government control.

469
00:38:41,932 --> 00:38:43,627
Godfather?

470
00:38:43,734 --> 00:38:45,725
Andrew.

471
00:38:45,836 --> 00:38:48,691
- Godfather--
- Off to Rome.

472
00:38:48,806 --> 00:38:51,798
l wanted to thank you
for all you've done for me.

473
00:38:51,909 --> 00:38:55,242
- Want to have some breakfast with us?
- No, thanks. l can't.

474
00:38:55,346 --> 00:38:57,234
How's your ltalian?

475
00:39:00,418 --> 00:39:02,841
- His father was a great lawyer.
- l know.

476
00:39:02,953 --> 00:39:05,342
Didn't live to see him ordained.
l did.

477
00:39:05,456 --> 00:39:07,617
Did you ever see one of those?

478
00:39:07,725 --> 00:39:10,785
Beautiful. l was so proud.
Let me walk you out.

479
00:39:12,563 --> 00:39:15,259
Andrew, if you hear any rumors flying
around the Vatican, let me know.

480
00:39:15,366 --> 00:39:17,960
No.
Andrew has the true faith.

481
00:39:27,578 --> 00:39:29,443
Don Corleone...

482
00:39:29,547 --> 00:39:31,572
l need your help.

483
00:39:31,682 --> 00:39:35,140
And not just to light
a little candle.

484
00:39:35,252 --> 00:39:39,746
My gift was to be able
to persuade people...

485
00:39:39,857 --> 00:39:43,122
to give to the Holy Church.

486
00:39:43,227 --> 00:39:45,252
Then Rome decides...

487
00:39:45,362 --> 00:39:48,024
to put me in charge
of the Vatican Bank.

488
00:39:50,101 --> 00:39:52,729
But l was never a true banker.

489
00:39:57,908 --> 00:40:00,240
l trusted my friends.

490
00:40:01,345 --> 00:40:03,301
Friendship and money...

491
00:40:04,615 --> 00:40:06,242
oil and water.

492
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:08,341
lndeed.

493
00:40:08,452 --> 00:40:11,751
But these friends used...

494
00:40:11,856 --> 00:40:13,744
the good name of the Church...

495
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:16,452
to feed their greed.

496
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,018
lf money was lost...

497
00:40:20,131 --> 00:40:22,053
then l am to blame.

498
00:40:23,734 --> 00:40:26,362
Oh, if only prayer
could pay off...

499
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:29,325
our $ 700 million deficit.

500
00:40:30,975 --> 00:40:33,671
769 million.

501
00:40:39,283 --> 00:40:44,573
The Church owns 25%%
of a large corporation-- lmmobiliare.

502
00:40:45,523 --> 00:40:47,650
You know the one l mean.

503
00:40:47,758 --> 00:40:52,024
Largest landlord on earth, real estate
all over the world worth $6 billion.

504
00:40:54,899 --> 00:40:56,560
That's true.

505
00:40:57,334 --> 00:41:00,895
And the Vatican vote
is necessary for control.

506
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:06,704
No. No, no.
You're mistaken.

507
00:41:06,811 --> 00:41:09,439
This isn't a question
of one person deciding--

508
00:41:09,547 --> 00:41:11,208
one deciding vote.

509
00:41:11,315 --> 00:41:13,510
This is like any other
company in the world.

510
00:41:13,617 --> 00:41:17,109
We have directors. We have rules.
We have very old rules.

511
00:41:18,222 --> 00:41:22,545
The pope himself would
have to approve you.

512
00:41:27,198 --> 00:41:28,927
We've sold the casinos...

513
00:41:30,868 --> 00:41:33,757
all businesses having to do
with gambling.

514
00:41:34,872 --> 00:41:38,228
We have no interests
or investments...

515
00:41:38,342 --> 00:41:40,606
in anything illegitimate.

516
00:41:43,614 --> 00:41:48,438
The Corleones are prepared to deposit
$500 million in the Vatican Bank...

517
00:41:48,552 --> 00:41:51,851
at such time as Mr. Corleone receives
majority control of lmmobiliare.

518
00:41:51,956 --> 00:41:54,754
lmmobiliare
could be something new--

519
00:41:54,859 --> 00:41:58,317
a European conglomerate.

520
00:41:58,429 --> 00:42:02,695
Few families have control
of such a company.

521
00:42:06,003 --> 00:42:08,836
lt seems in today's world...

522
00:42:08,939 --> 00:42:10,930
the power to absolve debt
is greater...

523
00:42:11,041 --> 00:42:13,271
than the power of forgiveness.

524
00:42:15,546 --> 00:42:17,434
$600 million.

525
00:42:22,353 --> 00:42:26,119
Don't overestimate
the power of forgiveness.

526
00:42:27,658 --> 00:42:31,685
Don Corleone,
this deal with lmmobiliare...

527
00:42:31,796 --> 00:42:34,651
can make you one of
the richest men in the world.

528
00:42:34,765 --> 00:42:37,962
Your whole past history
and the history of your family...

529
00:42:38,068 --> 00:42:40,298
will be washed away.

530
00:42:44,475 --> 00:42:46,136
600 million.

531
00:43:02,092 --> 00:43:04,014
[Keinszig]
The motion under discussion...

532
00:43:04,128 --> 00:43:07,086
relates to Corleone Group's proposal...

533
00:43:07,198 --> 00:43:09,564
to acquire 1 00 million...

534
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:12,261
newly issued class ''A '' voting shares.

535
00:43:13,704 --> 00:43:15,626
Once issued, the shares will permit...

536
00:43:15,739 --> 00:43:18,128
[B.J. Harrison]
Corleone's capital invested directly...

537
00:43:18,242 --> 00:43:21,370
into International Immobiliare...

538
00:43:21,478 --> 00:43:25,574
an old and respected
European company.

539
00:43:25,683 --> 00:43:28,174
But Michael Corleone
has an ambitious program...

540
00:43:28,252 --> 00:43:31,141
to expand this real estate
holding company...

541
00:43:31,255 --> 00:43:34,884
into an international conglomerate
that can meet the challenge...

542
00:43:34,992 --> 00:43:37,119
not by political ideologies...

543
00:43:37,228 --> 00:43:39,753
but by Eastern
techniques of efficiency...

544
00:43:39,864 --> 00:43:40,762
and focus...

545
00:43:40,865 --> 00:43:42,924
- Mr. Corleone!
- and unlimited--

546
00:43:43,033 --> 00:43:45,331
Mr. Corleone!
Excuse me.

547
00:43:45,436 --> 00:43:49,293
lsn't it true that you deposited
$200 million in the Vatican Bank...

548
00:43:49,406 --> 00:43:52,432
which is affiliated with
lnternational lmmobiliare?

549
00:43:52,543 --> 00:43:55,341
- This is true. Why not?
- Wasn't there any questioning...

550
00:43:55,446 --> 00:43:58,677
about the timing
on this particular deposit...

551
00:43:58,782 --> 00:44:00,670
or wasn't there
some talk about...

552
00:44:00,784 --> 00:44:03,173
- Mr. Chairman, if l may?
- the fact that--

553
00:44:04,655 --> 00:44:06,987
The Vito Andolino Corleone Foundation...

554
00:44:07,091 --> 00:44:09,184
of which Mr. Corleone's
daughter Mary is chairman...

555
00:44:09,293 --> 00:44:12,683
has established an endowment
in the amount of $ 1 00 million.

556
00:44:12,796 --> 00:44:15,026
The money comes from his own family...

557
00:44:15,132 --> 00:44:17,191
and will be administered
by the Vatican.

558
00:44:17,301 --> 00:44:18,791
Answer your question?

559
00:44:20,004 --> 00:44:22,802
l have always believed...

560
00:44:22,907 --> 00:44:26,729
helping your fellow man
is profitable in every sense--

561
00:44:26,844 --> 00:44:29,210
personally and bottom-line.

562
00:44:29,313 --> 00:44:33,477
My fellow shareholders,
if Europe and America...

563
00:44:33,584 --> 00:44:35,381
can learn to cooperate...

564
00:44:35,486 --> 00:44:39,343
if we can learn to pool our wealth,
share our markets...

565
00:44:39,456 --> 00:44:42,721
we can defeat any competition...

566
00:44:42,826 --> 00:44:44,487
anywhere in the world.

567
00:44:45,429 --> 00:44:47,920
Thank you for the time
you've given me today...

568
00:44:47,998 --> 00:44:51,388
and l hope that you
will look favorably on my proposal.

569
00:44:51,502 --> 00:44:52,560
Thank you.

570
00:44:58,208 --> 00:45:01,302
Listen, let me at
this microphone here!

571
00:45:01,412 --> 00:45:04,677
How can we let that criminal
run our company?

572
00:45:04,782 --> 00:45:06,909
He's got the map
of Sicily on his face.

573
00:45:07,017 --> 00:45:10,407
- Order! Order!
- He's either Catholic or mafioso.

574
00:45:10,521 --> 00:45:11,579
l say--

575
00:45:13,557 --> 00:45:15,616
The Hamilton lnvestors Group
cannot support...

576
00:45:15,726 --> 00:45:17,284
this proposal.

577
00:45:18,729 --> 00:45:21,220
Your Excellency?

578
00:45:21,298 --> 00:45:23,357
Mr. Chairman...

579
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:26,095
the Vatican Bank feels...

580
00:45:26,203 --> 00:45:31,459
that lnternational lmmobiliare...

581
00:45:31,575 --> 00:45:35,636
will be safe
in Mr. Corleone's hands.

582
00:45:35,746 --> 00:45:38,840
Subject to audit
and final ratification...

583
00:45:38,949 --> 00:45:41,042
which must
take place in Rome...

584
00:45:41,151 --> 00:45:44,279
please join me in welcoming
Mr. Michael Corleone.

585
00:45:54,732 --> 00:45:56,791
Dad?

586
00:45:59,103 --> 00:46:02,459
Tony says that l'm a front
for the foundation...

587
00:46:04,141 --> 00:46:07,804
that you're using me just to
pull the strings...

588
00:46:07,911 --> 00:46:11,005
- to get the money where you want it.
- Come on. Please.

589
00:46:11,115 --> 00:46:13,538
To shine up
your public image.

590
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:17,942
Mary, this is real,
this foundation.

591
00:46:18,055 --> 00:46:19,647
lt's real.

592
00:46:21,759 --> 00:46:24,387
l wanted Anthony
to be a part of it.

593
00:46:24,495 --> 00:46:27,020
l thought you two
would be together on this.

594
00:46:27,131 --> 00:46:28,962
l won't interfere.

595
00:46:29,066 --> 00:46:31,557
l'll help only if you ask.

596
00:46:31,635 --> 00:46:34,297
But what is this really for?

597
00:46:34,405 --> 00:46:36,293
Why are you doing this?

598
00:46:36,407 --> 00:46:39,137
Why am l doing this?

599
00:46:39,243 --> 00:46:42,371
l'm doing this for my children.

600
00:46:42,479 --> 00:46:44,435
You're doing it
for your children too.

601
00:46:45,215 --> 00:46:48,275
This foundation is supposed
to help all people.

602
00:46:48,385 --> 00:46:50,717
Of course.
That's the purpose.

603
00:46:50,821 --> 00:46:53,449
This is legitimate, Mary.

604
00:46:53,557 --> 00:46:55,445
l swear this is legitimate.

605
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:03,029
Dad, l want this to bring me
closer to you.

606
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:13,430
l would burn in hell...

607
00:47:13,544 --> 00:47:15,432
to keep you safe.

608
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:31,783
No, no. You go in the other car.
l'll ride with Michael.

609
00:47:31,895 --> 00:47:33,487
Go, go, go.

610
00:47:47,945 --> 00:47:50,243
As your family's oldest friend...

611
00:47:50,347 --> 00:47:53,680
l'm always chosen
to bring you messages.

612
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,509
Tell me, Don Altobello.

613
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:04,951
Your old partners are grateful
for the money you made them.

614
00:48:05,062 --> 00:48:08,327
They worship you.

615
00:48:08,432 --> 00:48:11,265
But their hearts are broken...

616
00:48:11,368 --> 00:48:14,826
because they think
you abandoned them.

617
00:48:14,938 --> 00:48:18,567
They want to share your deal
on lmmobiliare...

618
00:48:19,576 --> 00:48:21,464
to be a family again.

619
00:48:21,578 --> 00:48:24,103
lt can purify their money.

620
00:48:26,483 --> 00:48:27,882
This l cannot do.

621
00:48:30,988 --> 00:48:34,048
lmmobiliare must be legitimate.

622
00:48:35,893 --> 00:48:38,657
l know.

623
00:48:38,762 --> 00:48:40,525
But they're unhappy.

624
00:48:43,033 --> 00:48:44,796
And you?

625
00:48:44,902 --> 00:48:48,759
l ask nothing for myself.

626
00:48:48,872 --> 00:48:51,033
Only peace in my old age.

627
00:48:51,141 --> 00:48:54,269
But l must please
the world around me.

628
00:48:56,413 --> 00:49:00,907
Michael, your father was
a reasonable man.

629
00:49:01,018 --> 00:49:02,906
Learn from him.

630
00:49:04,688 --> 00:49:08,579
l learned many things
from my father.

631
00:49:13,664 --> 00:49:15,962
Call a meeting, my friend...

632
00:49:16,066 --> 00:49:20,127
so there are no debts or grudges.

633
00:49:20,237 --> 00:49:22,000
We will make the peace...

634
00:49:22,105 --> 00:49:23,663
you and l.

635
00:50:03,013 --> 00:50:05,072
They just had
a press conference.

636
00:50:05,182 --> 00:50:07,343
They said the pope's
condition is grave--

637
00:50:07,451 --> 00:50:10,079
gravissimo,
they said.

638
00:50:46,123 --> 00:50:48,182
Please...

639
00:50:48,292 --> 00:50:50,021
our group represents...

640
00:50:50,127 --> 00:50:52,925
a consortium
of Catholic businessmen...

641
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:56,124
against the Corleone control.

642
00:50:56,233 --> 00:50:59,122
The Vatican has cast its vote.

643
00:50:59,236 --> 00:51:01,625
The Corleone Group
already controls the board.

644
00:51:01,738 --> 00:51:05,629
According to the Lateran Treaty,
the Vatican's vote must be ratified...

645
00:51:05,742 --> 00:51:09,473
here in Rome by the pope.

646
00:51:13,016 --> 00:51:16,315
The pope is gravely ill.

647
00:51:17,554 --> 00:51:20,045
Until he recovers...

648
00:51:20,157 --> 00:51:22,284
l am powerless.

649
00:51:22,392 --> 00:51:24,622
What if he dies?

650
00:51:24,728 --> 00:51:26,320
Then...

651
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:29,490
as you Americans say,
all bets are off.

652
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,363
Gentlemen, please.

653
00:51:33,337 --> 00:51:35,498
This is a brief delay...

654
00:51:35,605 --> 00:51:37,095
nothing more.

655
00:51:41,611 --> 00:51:45,103
Your Excellency, gentlemen...

656
00:51:45,215 --> 00:51:48,514
l advise you join us
in our prayers...

657
00:51:48,618 --> 00:51:51,951
for the Holy Father's recovery.

658
00:51:52,055 --> 00:51:53,750
We had an agreement!

659
00:51:55,025 --> 00:51:58,916
This meeting was to be merely
a formality. That's all it was.

660
00:51:59,029 --> 00:52:02,453
-Please sit down.
-l'd rather stand. Could someone answer?

661
00:52:02,566 --> 00:52:06,354
- We have put ourselves on the line--
- The lmmobiliare has its roots...

662
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:08,301
in the European tradition.

663
00:52:08,405 --> 00:52:09,895
Please try to understand.

664
00:52:09,973 --> 00:52:11,861
l understand.

665
00:52:11,975 --> 00:52:14,034
Your tactics are despicable.

666
00:52:14,144 --> 00:52:17,910
Well, that's quite an indictment,
coming from a Corleone.

667
00:52:18,014 --> 00:52:19,447
Gentlemen!

668
00:52:19,549 --> 00:52:22,677
Remember you're in the Vatican.
Please.

669
00:52:25,589 --> 00:52:27,978
What is it that you want?

670
00:52:28,091 --> 00:52:29,353
Yes.

671
00:52:29,459 --> 00:52:32,087
You will take control.

672
00:52:32,195 --> 00:52:36,154
We'll gladly put you at the helm
of our little fleet...

673
00:52:36,266 --> 00:52:40,498
but our ships must all sail
in the same direction.

674
00:52:41,738 --> 00:52:43,171
Otherwise...

675
00:52:43,273 --> 00:52:47,471
who can say how long
your stay with us will last?

676
00:52:49,613 --> 00:52:51,672
lt's not personal.

677
00:52:51,782 --> 00:52:53,704
lt's only business.

678
00:52:53,817 --> 00:52:56,047
You should know, Godfather.

679
00:52:59,489 --> 00:53:01,047
Very well.

680
00:53:02,426 --> 00:53:05,054
You want to do
business with me...

681
00:53:05,162 --> 00:53:07,255
l will do business with you.

682
00:53:08,398 --> 00:53:10,286
Vipers, all of them.

683
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,364
- We're back with the Borgias.
- Uncle Michael.

684
00:53:19,476 --> 00:53:21,103
Andrew.

685
00:53:21,211 --> 00:53:24,271
l heard you were here.
lt's so nice to see you.

686
00:53:24,381 --> 00:53:27,145
- Vincent.
- How are you?

687
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:30,742
What is this with the Borgias?
Those days are over, Michael.

688
00:53:36,026 --> 00:53:39,416
- Recognize it?
- Yeah.

689
00:53:39,529 --> 00:53:41,656
Genco Olive Oil.

690
00:53:41,765 --> 00:53:43,960
That's where our grandfather
got his start...

691
00:53:44,067 --> 00:53:46,433
as a delivery boy making
three bucks a week.

692
00:53:46,536 --> 00:53:48,424
Three years later,
he owned the company.

693
00:53:48,538 --> 00:53:51,632
- Only in America.
- That's it.

694
00:53:51,741 --> 00:53:53,834
Vincenzo, where have you been hiding?

695
00:53:53,944 --> 00:53:56,640
You deserted us
when we need your help.

696
00:53:56,746 --> 00:53:58,008
What can l do?

697
00:53:58,114 --> 00:54:01,174
Get rid of Joe Zasa.
He sells drugs to children.

698
00:54:01,284 --> 00:54:03,844
When l was a girl, it was different.
l'm an older woman...

699
00:54:03,954 --> 00:54:05,717
afraid to walk the streets
at night.

700
00:54:05,822 --> 00:54:08,188
Where are they supposed to be at?

701
00:54:08,291 --> 00:54:10,623
- Lou, what's going on?
- He's going pazzo.

702
00:54:10,727 --> 00:54:12,752
- We're late.
- Don't tell me that garbage.

703
00:54:12,863 --> 00:54:15,923
- Have l ever let you down?
- l trust you.

704
00:54:16,032 --> 00:54:18,455
- Don't worry about it.
- Thank you very much.

705
00:54:18,568 --> 00:54:20,399
Enjoy yourself.

706
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:28,243
What was that?

707
00:54:29,546 --> 00:54:31,571
Neighborhood's in trouble.

708
00:54:31,681 --> 00:54:34,741
- You're keeping your eye out for them?
- That's right.

709
00:54:34,851 --> 00:54:37,649
- And for me?
- From now on.

710
00:54:37,754 --> 00:54:39,984
l missed you all this time.

711
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:42,479
l missed you, too, cousin.

712
00:54:42,592 --> 00:54:45,481
l missed growing up
with all my cousins.

713
00:54:45,595 --> 00:54:48,018
l didn't know you,
and l missed you.

714
00:54:48,131 --> 00:54:52,989
Do you remember stories
about our fathers, the old days?

715
00:54:53,103 --> 00:54:55,492
Yeah. What do you
want to know?

716
00:54:57,974 --> 00:54:59,532
What was Sonny like?

717
00:55:02,145 --> 00:55:04,739
He was the prince of the city.

718
00:55:04,848 --> 00:55:08,670
He died before l was born, but l heard
a million stories. He was a legend.

719
00:55:10,453 --> 00:55:12,546
What about my father?

720
00:55:12,656 --> 00:55:15,147
A great man, your father.

721
00:55:15,225 --> 00:55:18,149
He's a hero.
He saved the family.

722
00:55:19,496 --> 00:55:21,384
- Vincent.
- What?

723
00:55:21,498 --> 00:55:24,228
Did he kill
his own brother?

724
00:55:32,075 --> 00:55:34,737
So those are all lies?

725
00:55:38,081 --> 00:55:39,969
Just stories, sweetheart.

726
00:55:48,224 --> 00:55:49,418
l believe you.

727
00:55:51,328 --> 00:55:55,253
- l'm glad you're around.
- l'm glad you're here too.

728
00:56:17,988 --> 00:56:21,321
l'd like to take Joey Zasa up
for a ride in this and drop him.

729
00:56:21,424 --> 00:56:24,313
Joey Zasa is nothing.

730
00:56:24,427 --> 00:56:26,918
He's a small-time enforcer.

731
00:56:26,997 --> 00:56:29,795
He bluffs, threats, but nothing.

732
00:56:29,899 --> 00:56:32,424
You'll be able to see him coming
a mile away.

733
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:35,531
We should kill him
before he kills--

734
00:56:38,775 --> 00:56:41,664
Never hate your enemies.

735
00:56:41,778 --> 00:56:43,803
lt affects your judgment.

736
00:56:58,728 --> 00:57:02,220
Good evening.
Nice to see you again, Mr. Corleone.

737
00:57:22,519 --> 00:57:25,443
Okay, girls, let's go.
Come on, girls.

738
00:57:42,672 --> 00:57:47,029
We trusted you to manage
our money in the casinos.

739
00:57:47,143 --> 00:57:49,338
lt's not even 20 years...

740
00:57:49,446 --> 00:57:53,041
you sold the casinos
and you made fortunes for all of us.

741
00:57:53,149 --> 00:57:55,037
Bravo, Don Corleone!

742
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,646
Thank you.

743
00:57:59,856 --> 00:58:03,189
Friends, l have come here...

744
00:58:03,293 --> 00:58:06,956
because our business
together is done.

745
00:58:08,364 --> 00:58:12,095
We have prospered,
and now it is time for us...

746
00:58:12,202 --> 00:58:15,399
to dissolve the business
relationship between us.

747
00:58:17,207 --> 00:58:19,402
That's it.

748
00:58:19,509 --> 00:58:22,273
But l do have
a little surprise. Al?

749
00:58:25,281 --> 00:58:28,079
Your shares in the casino.

750
00:58:28,184 --> 00:58:30,072
l thought l'd cut through
all the red tape...

751
00:58:30,186 --> 00:58:32,518
so you can get
your money right away.

752
00:58:38,628 --> 00:58:42,917
- $50 million!
- Not everybody gets the same.

753
00:58:43,032 --> 00:58:44,954
- lt depends on how much...
- Nothing for you.

754
00:58:45,068 --> 00:58:46,956
you invested and how long for.

755
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:50,028
Michael,
this is really generous!

756
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:52,199
Oh, wonderful.

757
00:58:55,311 --> 00:58:59,168
- Hey, Parisi, how much did you invest?
- l don't remember.

758
00:58:59,282 --> 00:59:01,409
Michael, you're blessed.

759
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:10,789
My family has done
much of the hard work...

760
00:59:10,894 --> 00:59:12,782
taken many risks...

761
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:17,490
all to make money
for the rest of the families.

762
00:59:19,903 --> 00:59:22,736
You all know Joey Zasa.

763
00:59:22,839 --> 00:59:25,228
He is, l admit, an important man.

764
00:59:26,376 --> 00:59:30,574
His picture is on the cover
of the New York Times Magazine.

765
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:33,274
He gets the Esquire magazine award...

766
00:59:33,383 --> 00:59:35,908
for the best-dressed gangster.

767
00:59:36,019 --> 00:59:37,907
The newspapers praise him...

768
00:59:38,021 --> 00:59:40,819
because he hires blacks
into his family...

769
00:59:40,924 --> 00:59:42,585
which shows he has a good heart.

770
00:59:44,861 --> 00:59:47,386
He is famous.

771
00:59:47,497 --> 00:59:51,285
Who knows?
Maybe one day...

772
00:59:51,401 --> 00:59:53,665
he will make all of you popular.

773
00:59:55,271 --> 00:59:56,670
lt's true.

774
00:59:56,773 --> 01:00:02,097
l make more of a bella figura.
That is my nature.

775
01:00:02,212 --> 01:00:07,445
But l also want to make a move
into legitimate enterprises.

776
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:10,314
l'd like to get a little pin
from the pope.

777
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:15,847
Sure, l take the blacks and the Spanish
into my family...

778
01:00:15,959 --> 01:00:19,349
because that's America.

779
01:00:19,462 --> 01:00:24,217
And you guarantee that they don't
deal drugs in those neighborhoods.

780
01:00:25,335 --> 01:00:30,534
l don't guarantee that.
l guarantee l'll kill anybody who does.

781
01:00:34,644 --> 01:00:37,408
Let me talk to him.

782
01:00:37,513 --> 01:00:39,743
Who can refuse Don Altobello?

783
01:00:43,086 --> 01:00:47,375
l say to all of you,
l have been treated this day...

784
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:49,879
with no respect.

785
01:00:49,993 --> 01:00:53,656
l've earned you all money.
l've made you rich...

786
01:00:53,763 --> 01:00:55,321
and l asked for little.

787
01:00:55,431 --> 01:00:59,322
Good. You will not give?
l'll take.

788
01:01:00,603 --> 01:01:03,163
As for Don Corleone...

789
01:01:03,273 --> 01:01:06,936
well, he makes it
very clear to me today...

790
01:01:07,043 --> 01:01:10,240
that he is my enemy.

791
01:01:13,249 --> 01:01:15,638
You must choose between us.

792
01:01:24,227 --> 01:01:26,286
We can reason together.

793
01:01:30,366 --> 01:01:33,460
Please, let's agree, huh?

794
01:01:33,569 --> 01:01:35,457
He doesn't know what he's--

795
01:01:44,047 --> 01:01:45,935
The news is everywhere.

796
01:01:46,049 --> 01:01:49,940
Everyone is saying
that you control lmmobiliare.

797
01:01:50,053 --> 01:01:54,114
lmmobiliare already is laundering money
in Peru and Nassau.

798
01:01:54,223 --> 01:01:55,451
We know that.

799
01:01:55,558 --> 01:01:59,255
Listen to me. We've been
friends for 40 years.

800
01:01:59,362 --> 01:02:01,125
We should wet
our beaks a little, huh?

801
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:04,495
- We want to do business with you.
- That's right.

802
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,556
- We've been together too much.
- We can wash our money clean...

803
01:02:06,669 --> 01:02:08,432
in the holy water of--

804
01:02:13,776 --> 01:02:15,607
What the hell is that?

805
01:02:15,712 --> 01:02:17,475
- lt's a hit. Let's go. Follow me.
- Let's get outta here!

806
01:02:38,267 --> 01:02:41,156
- My coat! lt's my lucky coat!
- Forget your coat.

807
01:02:42,271 --> 01:02:44,102
lt's my lucky coat!

808
01:02:50,279 --> 01:02:51,678
Stay right behind me!

809
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,686
- Fuck!
- Mikey, this way!

810
01:03:19,475 --> 01:03:21,841
You son of a bitch.

811
01:03:41,597 --> 01:03:43,656
Come on, we're outta here.

812
01:04:16,699 --> 01:04:18,098
You did good.

813
01:04:19,535 --> 01:04:22,629
The old Dons were pretty much
wiped out.

814
01:04:22,738 --> 01:04:25,627
The ones that survived
made deals with Joey Zasa.

815
01:04:28,277 --> 01:04:32,270
He survived. He's with his daughters
now in Staten lsland.

816
01:04:32,381 --> 01:04:34,770
Says he's gonna retire to Sicily.

817
01:04:36,552 --> 01:04:41,512
Joey Zasa would never pull something
like this without the backing.

818
01:04:41,624 --> 01:04:45,014
He's just muscle.
He's an enforcer. He's nothing.

819
01:04:45,128 --> 01:04:47,517
He doesn't have the wit
for that helicopter attack.

820
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:50,224
He doesn't even have the ambition
to wipe out the whole commission.

821
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:54,793
- Certainly not the balls.
- l say we hit back and take Zasa out!

822
01:05:00,543 --> 01:05:03,432
Never let anyone know
what you're thinking.

823
01:05:11,554 --> 01:05:14,443
Well, let's get a message
to Joey Zasa.

824
01:05:17,527 --> 01:05:19,586
l respect what he's done.

825
01:05:21,164 --> 01:05:24,258
The new overthrows the old.
lt's natural.

826
01:05:24,367 --> 01:05:25,766
How can you do business
with this guy?

827
01:05:29,472 --> 01:05:33,533
l'm a businessman, first and foremost.
l want no further conflict with him.

828
01:05:33,643 --> 01:05:36,305
You tell him from me
that he can live or he can die.

829
01:05:36,412 --> 01:05:38,471
Vincent, will you shut up!

830
01:05:56,632 --> 01:05:58,554
That's it.

831
01:06:02,338 --> 01:06:04,727
He can't be doing this alone.

832
01:06:08,477 --> 01:06:13,471
Just when l thought l was out,
they pull me back in.

833
01:06:21,224 --> 01:06:23,920
Our true enemy...

834
01:06:24,026 --> 01:06:26,915
has not yet shown his face.

835
01:06:39,642 --> 01:06:42,031
- Has he had his medicine?
- l don't know what he took.

836
01:06:46,148 --> 01:06:48,639
- l got my wind back.
- Call a doctor.

837
01:06:51,153 --> 01:06:53,246
Run, run!

838
01:06:53,356 --> 01:06:56,416
Run at thunderbolt.
Thunder can't hurt.

839
01:06:56,525 --> 01:06:59,255
Harmless noise.

840
01:06:59,362 --> 01:07:01,455
- Get an ambulance.
- Bullshit!

841
01:07:01,564 --> 01:07:05,352
You deceitful old fuck.

842
01:07:05,468 --> 01:07:07,959
Altobello, you fuck!

843
01:07:26,222 --> 01:07:28,110
Vitals are all steady.

844
01:07:32,962 --> 01:07:34,361
Lift.

845
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,425
Oh, God.

846
01:07:39,535 --> 01:07:41,423
- Okay, okay.
- Dad.

847
01:07:43,539 --> 01:07:45,495
Excuse me. Clear, please.

848
01:07:45,608 --> 01:07:47,496
l'll call Kay.

849
01:07:57,887 --> 01:08:00,447
- Good evening, sir.
- Can we wait here? l'll be right back.

850
01:08:00,556 --> 01:08:01,955
Certainly, sir.

851
01:08:08,497 --> 01:08:12,354
Mr. Harrison,
you said it was urgent.

852
01:08:12,468 --> 01:08:14,993
Have you come to confess your sins?

853
01:08:15,104 --> 01:08:17,163
Michael Corleone suffered
a diabetic stroke.

854
01:08:17,273 --> 01:08:20,367
l thought you should know that
before you read it in the papers.

855
01:08:20,476 --> 01:08:22,637
He's in a coma
on the critical list.

856
01:08:22,745 --> 01:08:25,270
l'm here to insist
the deal goes through in any event.

857
01:08:25,381 --> 01:08:27,474
The pope has not much time left.

858
01:08:29,151 --> 01:08:33,178
So, as you,
l am in a difficult position.

859
01:08:33,289 --> 01:08:35,678
We have to ratify this deal
as soon as possible.

860
01:08:37,393 --> 01:08:39,281
We have an understanding.

861
01:08:39,395 --> 01:08:42,728
Good. l'm going to the hospital.

862
01:08:42,832 --> 01:08:45,721
- l'll pray for Mr. Corleone.
- Thank you.

863
01:08:50,072 --> 01:08:51,630
Our thoughts are with Mr. Corleone.

864
01:08:51,741 --> 01:08:53,629
Thank you, Father.

865
01:08:56,712 --> 01:09:01,502
Everything will be out in the open
if Corleone dies.

866
01:09:01,617 --> 01:09:03,710
Pray for time, Keinszig.

867
01:09:03,819 --> 01:09:09,212
A habit born of...
a long contemplation of eternity.

868
01:09:15,831 --> 01:09:19,562
-Just forget about it, Vinnie.
-Why forget about it? lt's a simple hit.

869
01:09:19,668 --> 01:09:24,128
Look, l'd love to smack Joey Zasa
then whack the fag, okay?

870
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:27,732
But it's impossible.
He's always mingling with people...

871
01:09:27,843 --> 01:09:30,835
in front of TV cameras
in his own neighborhood.

872
01:09:30,946 --> 01:09:33,574
- lt's impossible.
- lt's not. lt'll work for us.

873
01:09:33,682 --> 01:09:35,240
How?

874
01:09:35,351 --> 01:09:40,379
You think he's gonna let Uncle Michael
survive this thing? Would you?

875
01:09:40,489 --> 01:09:44,687
He may not survive anyway.
How would you do it?

876
01:09:44,794 --> 01:09:47,183
l'd do it.
l'd do it myself.

877
01:09:49,298 --> 01:09:51,186
Do it!

878
01:09:53,235 --> 01:09:55,965
- What would you need?
- See if you can get me a couple guys.

879
01:10:31,674 --> 01:10:33,562
lt's Kay.

880
01:10:42,184 --> 01:10:44,277
l never expected you to come.

881
01:10:44,386 --> 01:10:46,775
No, l know, l know.

882
01:10:49,391 --> 01:10:51,120
But l'm here.

883
01:10:54,897 --> 01:10:56,956
- l'm glad.
- You know...

884
01:11:00,636 --> 01:11:03,002
this is the first time
l've seen you look so helpless.

885
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:10,199
lt's not so bad, really.

886
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:15,978
l feel...
l'm getting wiser now.

887
01:11:16,085 --> 01:11:19,384
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

888
01:11:19,488 --> 01:11:21,376
The sicker you get,
the wiser you get, huh?

889
01:11:22,892 --> 01:11:25,122
When l'm dead,
l'm gonna be really smart.

890
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:31,022
- Yeah?
- l want to thank you for Tony.

891
01:11:33,903 --> 01:11:38,192
He's doing really well.
He's gotten some very good notices...

892
01:11:38,307 --> 01:11:41,401
and he's going to be making
his operatic debut in Sicily...

893
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:44,001
in Palermo, this Easter.

894
01:11:45,814 --> 01:11:47,213
So, thank you.

895
01:11:48,817 --> 01:11:51,706
That's a real honor.
ln Sicily.

896
01:11:56,825 --> 01:12:00,784
l will be there.
l won't miss that.

897
01:12:00,896 --> 01:12:02,386
l won't miss that.

898
01:12:12,575 --> 01:12:14,463
Go see Dad.

899
01:12:19,648 --> 01:12:21,673
- Oh, sweetheart.
- Everything's gonna be all right.

900
01:12:24,853 --> 01:12:27,344
- How you doing, Papa?
- Come here.

901
01:12:29,325 --> 01:12:32,385
Your mother told me.
She told me what happened.

902
01:12:32,494 --> 01:12:36,089
About Palermo?
l really want you to be there, Dad.

903
01:12:36,198 --> 01:12:38,587
Of course. Come here, kiss me.

904
01:12:57,853 --> 01:12:59,912
- Cousin Vinnie?
- No, he isn't here.

905
01:13:00,022 --> 01:13:03,913
Why don't you call his apartment,
leave a message on his machine?

906
01:13:04,026 --> 01:13:06,392
- lt's your cousin, Mary.
- Let her in.

907
01:13:10,299 --> 01:13:12,859
- Thanks. Hi, cous.
- Hi.

908
01:13:12,968 --> 01:13:15,528
l just thought l'd drop by.
ls that okay?

909
01:13:15,638 --> 01:13:17,526
l'm gonna get the guys.

910
01:13:19,642 --> 01:13:22,531
No, it's not okay.
You shouldn't have come.

911
01:13:24,179 --> 01:13:26,409
A couple minutes only, okay?

912
01:13:27,816 --> 01:13:30,705
- You look beautiful, cous.
- Thanks.

913
01:13:33,889 --> 01:13:37,188
So this is your club,
your hideout?

914
01:13:37,292 --> 01:13:40,455
- Yeah.
- l came here to check it out.

915
01:13:45,067 --> 01:13:49,060
lt's so strange, just me
and Aunt Connie in the house.

916
01:13:49,171 --> 01:13:52,163
l feel better when l'm with you.

917
01:13:52,274 --> 01:13:53,969
What's wrong, sweetheart?

918
01:13:54,076 --> 01:13:56,806
- l'm really scared about my father.
- Don't be scared.

919
01:13:56,912 --> 01:14:00,734
When l saw them take him out of
that ambulance, l thought he was dead.

920
01:14:00,849 --> 01:14:03,738
l know.
Everybody says he's gonna be better.

921
01:14:05,621 --> 01:14:07,885
Don't worry, okay?

922
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:10,550
l remember them shooting at our house
when l was little.

923
01:14:11,727 --> 01:14:14,491
And Al Neri came one time
with other bodyguards...

924
01:14:14,596 --> 01:14:16,655
and just took me and Tony away.

925
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,659
ls it all happening again?

926
01:14:22,204 --> 01:14:24,092
Not like that, sweetie.

927
01:14:25,874 --> 01:14:31,471
Then why are you hiding here?
ls something going to happen to you?

928
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:35,471
Nothing's gonna happen to me.
l'll take care of you.

929
01:14:46,729 --> 01:14:51,291
- Can l stay here and hide out with you?
- You have to make gnocchi for the boys.

930
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,790
You know l don't know how to cook,
but l'll help.

931
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:10,115
Okay.

932
01:15:10,219 --> 01:15:12,107
What do l do?

933
01:15:44,186 --> 01:15:47,075
- l love you, cous.
- l love you, too, cous.

934
01:15:51,226 --> 01:15:53,114
Okay, let's cook.

935
01:16:09,545 --> 01:16:10,944
Hold me.

936
01:16:47,416 --> 01:16:49,543
You know, the people like you,
the press, the police...

937
01:16:49,651 --> 01:16:52,313
you use words like ''Mafia,''
''Cosa Nostra.''

938
01:16:52,421 --> 01:16:56,278
This is a fantasy.
The ltalian-Americans are great people.

939
01:16:56,391 --> 01:16:58,723
We laid the bricks that built
this city. We have the artists.

940
01:16:58,827 --> 01:17:00,783
We have Meucci.
He invented the telephone.

941
01:17:00,896 --> 01:17:04,627
We have Don Ameche who played the guy
who invented the telephone. Huh?

942
01:17:04,733 --> 01:17:06,792
So, listen, buy yourself
a nice raffle ticket.

943
01:17:06,902 --> 01:17:08,790
Maybe win yourself a Cadillac.

944
01:17:10,305 --> 01:17:12,603
The salciccia is wonderful.

945
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:14,903
Here, have a sandwich.
Let's go.

946
01:17:27,689 --> 01:17:29,611
Nice to see you, Mr. Zasa.

947
01:17:29,725 --> 01:17:31,613
Have a nice time.

948
01:17:32,861 --> 01:17:35,250
Don't forget to buy
your raffle tickets, huh?

949
01:17:38,166 --> 01:17:40,293
What are you doin'?

950
01:17:40,402 --> 01:17:42,893
- He's sorry. Come here, son.
- Okay, let's go.

951
01:18:04,826 --> 01:18:05,952
What's what?
How are you?

952
01:18:07,062 --> 01:18:09,587
How are you, buddy boy, huh?

953
01:18:12,467 --> 01:18:13,525
Up your ass!

954
01:18:15,203 --> 01:18:17,592
- Who is that, huh? You know him?
- lgnore him.

955
01:18:17,706 --> 01:18:21,528
Hey,Joey, who's gonna win the car?
The Ant?

956
01:18:23,445 --> 01:18:25,868
This is the thing that gives
the ltalian-Americans a bad name, huh?

957
01:18:25,981 --> 01:18:27,539
A cappone like this, huh?

958
01:18:27,649 --> 01:18:30,038
Hey,Joey, up your ass!

959
01:18:30,152 --> 01:18:33,110
Get off of that fuckin' car.
You got a raffle ticket?

960
01:18:34,289 --> 01:18:37,645
Take a good look
at my raffle ticket here.

961
01:18:37,759 --> 01:18:41,752
Here's what l think of you
and your raffle ticket.

962
01:18:41,863 --> 01:18:43,751
l told you,
get the fuck outta here, punk.

963
01:18:43,865 --> 01:18:45,594
l'll break your fuckin' arm.

964
01:18:45,701 --> 01:18:48,124
l want you to get the fuck outta here.

965
01:18:48,236 --> 01:18:50,898
Get outta here.
Get outta here.

966
01:19:06,388 --> 01:19:07,912
Run,Joey, you piece of shit!

967
01:19:21,837 --> 01:19:24,203
- Open the door! Open the door!
- Hi,Joe.

968
01:19:47,195 --> 01:19:52,690
Don't ever again give
that kind of order.

969
01:19:52,801 --> 01:19:54,496
Not while l'm alive.

970
01:19:54,603 --> 01:19:56,491
Understand?

971
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:01,567
You were too sick to make a decision.
l got a go-ahead from Neri.

972
01:20:02,677 --> 01:20:04,167
l got a go-ahead from Connie.

973
01:20:16,058 --> 01:20:19,357
lt was the right decision,
Uncle Michael.

974
01:20:19,461 --> 01:20:23,318
lt was the wrong decision.
l command this family.

975
01:20:23,432 --> 01:20:26,731
Right or wrong...

976
01:20:26,835 --> 01:20:29,224
it was not what l wanted!

977
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:50,012
Do you understand?

978
01:20:56,131 --> 01:20:57,962
Yes.

979
01:21:04,873 --> 01:21:06,431
Come on, Michael.

980
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:19,619
Yes!

981
01:21:21,556 --> 01:21:23,547
Good.

982
01:21:23,658 --> 01:21:28,652
Help me to my bed. l wanna
talk to you alone for a minute.

983
01:21:35,871 --> 01:21:40,296
You know, l always felt
responsible for you.

984
01:21:40,408 --> 01:21:41,966
You know that.

985
01:21:43,378 --> 01:21:46,802
Your father-- my brother--

986
01:21:46,915 --> 01:21:49,611
we were opposites.

987
01:21:49,718 --> 01:21:52,482
We would fight and argue...

988
01:21:52,587 --> 01:21:54,578
but l never doubted his love.

989
01:21:54,689 --> 01:21:58,079
He would do anything for me.

990
01:21:58,193 --> 01:21:59,956
But his temper...

991
01:22:03,098 --> 01:22:05,464
it was too much.

992
01:22:05,567 --> 01:22:07,125
Clouded his reason.

993
01:22:08,403 --> 01:22:11,292
l don't want you to make
that mistake.

994
01:22:13,942 --> 01:22:15,341
Also...

995
01:22:16,278 --> 01:22:19,509
he, too, had a way with women.

996
01:22:22,083 --> 01:22:25,871
- So l hear.
- What are you doing with my daughter?

997
01:22:28,557 --> 01:22:30,445
What are you doing with her?

998
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:37,218
lt's too dangerous.

999
01:22:39,968 --> 01:22:41,856
You hear me?

1000
01:23:09,297 --> 01:23:11,492
When they come...

1001
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,989
they'll come at what you love.

1002
01:23:21,843 --> 01:23:25,176
Michael, you must lead
another life.

1003
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,441
You have everything a man could desire.

1004
01:23:27,549 --> 01:23:31,212
lt's time for you to retire.

1005
01:23:31,319 --> 01:23:33,708
l have too much responsibility.

1006
01:23:37,692 --> 01:23:41,082
Too difficult now.
You should really get out.

1007
01:23:41,196 --> 01:23:45,929
What do you know
about those pezzonovante in ltaly?

1008
01:23:49,838 --> 01:23:53,626
l'm too old to know anything
about those new people.

1009
01:23:53,742 --> 01:23:58,372
l must accept my age
and grow my olives and tomatoes.

1010
01:23:59,648 --> 01:24:04,403
- We're not that old.
- But you're very ill.

1011
01:24:07,188 --> 01:24:09,520
Let me see what can be done.

1012
01:24:09,624 --> 01:24:14,049
Let me work to make your path
a little easier.

1013
01:24:14,162 --> 01:24:17,427
Your friendship does that always.

1014
01:24:17,532 --> 01:24:19,420
That makes me happy.

1015
01:24:22,370 --> 01:24:23,803
You were wrong about him.

1016
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:28,530
l trust too much.
That's always been my fault.

1017
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,311
Treachery is everywhere.

1018
01:24:40,422 --> 01:24:46,110
You still have your fingers
on the strings, even now.

1019
01:24:46,227 --> 01:24:48,616
Let's see more of each other.

1020
01:24:50,999 --> 01:24:53,388
- In Sicily?
- In Sicily.

1021
01:25:46,692 --> 01:25:49,024
How are you?

1022
01:25:49,128 --> 01:25:51,653
Don Bendino, my old friend.

1023
01:26:22,995 --> 01:26:25,054
l wanted to bring you here...

1024
01:26:25,164 --> 01:26:28,793
so that my old friend and protector,
Don Tommasino...

1025
01:26:28,901 --> 01:26:30,789
could advise us.

1026
01:26:49,121 --> 01:26:53,080
The bloodbath in Atlantic City
left New York a mess.

1027
01:26:53,192 --> 01:26:56,650
Now,Joey Zasa at least was running
a fairly tight ship.

1028
01:26:56,762 --> 01:27:00,254
But now that he's out of the picture,
we're obligated to step in.

1029
01:27:00,366 --> 01:27:02,425
Step back in?

1030
01:27:02,535 --> 01:27:04,924
lf we don't,
the Chinese and Colombians will.

1031
01:27:36,235 --> 01:27:39,966
Our ships must all sail
in the same direction.

1032
01:27:41,273 --> 01:27:44,333
ltalian politics have had
these kind of men for centuries.

1033
01:27:44,443 --> 01:27:46,934
They are the true Mafia.

1034
01:27:47,046 --> 01:27:50,402
The archbishop and the Vatican Bank,
that's the big problem.

1035
01:27:50,516 --> 01:27:54,839
They're the same problem.
BJ, they're connected.

1036
01:27:54,954 --> 01:27:57,980
The archbishop has
very powerful friends.

1037
01:28:00,993 --> 01:28:02,824
They totally protect him.

1038
01:28:28,454 --> 01:28:31,048
l will go see
this Cardinal Lamberto...

1039
01:28:31,157 --> 01:28:34,012
and see if we can work things out
in a civilized way.

1040
01:28:35,928 --> 01:28:37,987
You honor your agreements...

1041
01:28:38,097 --> 01:28:40,622
but these people
you're dealing with are crooks.

1042
01:28:40,733 --> 01:28:42,621
They have no honor.

1043
01:28:45,738 --> 01:28:47,228
My word is final.

1044
01:29:24,610 --> 01:29:26,703
l've invited you all here...

1045
01:29:26,812 --> 01:29:31,044
to celebrate my son's
first appearance in an opera house.

1046
01:29:31,150 --> 01:29:32,708
- We're playing Philadelphia.
- He'll be appearing...

1047
01:29:32,818 --> 01:29:34,774
- What's Philadelphia?
- in about three weeks...

1048
01:29:34,887 --> 01:29:36,946
Seven cards, two down,
four up, one down...

1049
01:29:37,056 --> 01:29:39,012
- at the Theatre Massimo...
- deuces and one-eyed jacks are wild.

1050
01:29:39,125 --> 01:29:41,753
in the opera ''Cavallaria''Rusticana.

1051
01:29:41,861 --> 01:29:45,683
lt's Cavalleria Rusticana.

1052
01:29:45,798 --> 01:29:48,722
l think l got tickets
to the wrong opera.

1053
01:29:48,834 --> 01:29:51,997
l've been in New York too long.
Anyway...

1054
01:29:52,104 --> 01:29:55,665
you will all receive tickets,
so come on time.

1055
01:29:55,775 --> 01:29:57,663
Dad, l've got a present for you.

1056
01:30:01,847 --> 01:30:03,974
lt comes from the town of Corleone...

1057
01:30:04,083 --> 01:30:06,108
and it's authentic Sicilian.

1058
01:30:07,219 --> 01:30:10,780
And l learned it for you.

1059
01:31:40,045 --> 01:31:44,141
She was wonderful, beautiful,
and I loved her.

1060
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:46,480
Then she died.

1061
01:31:46,585 --> 01:31:50,180
My trusted bodyguard...

1062
01:31:50,289 --> 01:31:53,520
planted a bomb in my car.

1063
01:31:53,626 --> 01:31:55,514
She drove it before l did.

1064
01:31:57,129 --> 01:32:00,792
Why is such a beautiful country
so violent?

1065
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:02,458
History.

1066
01:32:02,568 --> 01:32:04,832
Mom was telling me about the old days.

1067
01:32:04,937 --> 01:32:09,067
- Your biggest worry was passing exams.
- Yes, it was then.

1068
01:32:09,174 --> 01:32:11,165
l worry about you now.

1069
01:32:12,845 --> 01:32:16,406
Mary, you're such a warmhearted girl.
You always were.

1070
01:32:16,515 --> 01:32:20,246
- l love my family.
- Even your cousin Vincent?

1071
01:32:24,256 --> 01:32:26,019
l really love him.

1072
01:32:27,493 --> 01:32:31,725
- He's your first cousin.
- Then l love him first.

1073
01:32:31,830 --> 01:32:34,560
Mary, you can't see him.

1074
01:32:34,667 --> 01:32:38,023
Just don't see him anymore.

1075
01:32:38,137 --> 01:32:41,959
He's right.
lt's too dangerous.

1076
01:32:44,543 --> 01:32:47,876
Listen to me.
You can't see him anymore.

1077
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:49,709
- Not in that fashion.
- No.

1078
01:32:51,550 --> 01:32:53,643
Please, promise me.

1079
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:57,218
- Obey me on this.
- No, Dad!

1080
01:33:02,661 --> 01:33:06,984
Mary's smart, Dad.
She'll understand eventually.

1081
01:33:43,969 --> 01:33:47,166
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

1082
01:33:47,272 --> 01:33:49,934
- l want you to do something for me.
- Okay.

1083
01:33:50,042 --> 01:33:52,465
lt's dangerous.

1084
01:33:52,578 --> 01:33:56,503
Good, l'm in.
What do you need?

1085
01:33:56,615 --> 01:34:00,312
l want you to sell your soul
to Don Altobello...

1086
01:34:00,419 --> 01:34:02,307
to betray me.

1087
01:34:05,657 --> 01:34:08,421
He'd never believe me.
Here.

1088
01:34:08,527 --> 01:34:10,757
- That depends.
- Sit down.

1089
01:34:13,999 --> 01:34:15,887
l have an idea.

1090
01:34:17,169 --> 01:34:21,060
See if you can learn
how high Altobello is connected.

1091
01:34:24,843 --> 01:34:26,731
Arrange a meeting.

1092
01:34:29,281 --> 01:34:34,412
You say how devoted you are to me.
Tell him your problems.

1093
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:37,409
- You ask for his help.
- What problems?

1094
01:34:39,591 --> 01:34:41,479
That you want to run away
with my daughter.

1095
01:34:43,128 --> 01:34:47,519
Only you know that if you do,
l will become your enemy.

1096
01:34:52,271 --> 01:34:54,501
You know l would never do that,
Uncle Mike.

1097
01:34:54,606 --> 01:34:55,664
l know.

1098
01:34:56,942 --> 01:34:59,866
You ask Altobello to speak to me...

1099
01:34:59,978 --> 01:35:01,934
to further the marriage.

1100
01:35:02,047 --> 01:35:04,345
But you're cousins, after all.

1101
01:35:04,450 --> 01:35:07,874
Michael was always
a little old-fashioned.

1102
01:35:07,986 --> 01:35:09,044
Explain to him how...

1103
01:35:09,154 --> 01:35:11,418
you could never be a part
of my legitimate world...

1104
01:35:11,523 --> 01:35:13,081
that you want your own family.

1105
01:35:13,192 --> 01:35:17,083
l could straighten out
what Zasa left behind.

1106
01:35:18,831 --> 01:35:21,220
l could use your friendship
to persuade him.

1107
01:35:22,768 --> 01:35:25,157
l would be indebted to you forever.

1108
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:31,530
Corleones know the value
of such a friend.

1109
01:35:33,011 --> 01:35:35,400
So then you would work for me?

1110
01:35:44,056 --> 01:35:45,717
Remember...

1111
01:35:45,824 --> 01:35:50,750
if he hints that he wants you
to betray me, get insulted...

1112
01:35:50,863 --> 01:35:52,785
because that's his trap.

1113
01:36:00,439 --> 01:36:03,328
You're not telling me
the whole truth.

1114
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:10,643
lsn't it true, with Michael gone...

1115
01:36:10,749 --> 01:36:13,138
the girl controls everything?

1116
01:36:16,655 --> 01:36:18,748
You leave the girl out of this.

1117
01:36:18,857 --> 01:36:22,247
Of course, you love her,
and she loves you.

1118
01:36:43,182 --> 01:36:45,571
l guessed it, huh?

1119
01:36:47,219 --> 01:36:50,609
You're a wise man, Don Altobello.

1120
01:36:50,722 --> 01:36:53,350
l'm gonna be learning a lot
from you.

1121
01:36:53,458 --> 01:36:56,188
The richest man is the one
with the most powerful friends.

1122
01:36:58,964 --> 01:37:02,127
lt's my duty to make
the introductions.

1123
01:37:09,107 --> 01:37:10,995
Don Lucchesi.

1124
01:37:13,845 --> 01:37:16,473
Don Altobello tells me
you have a good character...

1125
01:37:16,582 --> 01:37:19,642
strong,
a man of respect.

1126
01:37:19,751 --> 01:37:23,539
This is the hero
who put Joey Zasa in his grave.

1127
01:37:23,655 --> 01:37:27,944
lf we'd have known of his existence,
we would never have backed Joey.

1128
01:37:28,060 --> 01:37:29,948
No one wants another Joe.

1129
01:37:31,897 --> 01:37:33,194
Let me be your friend.

1130
01:37:34,933 --> 01:37:37,857
Even the strongest man needs friends.

1131
01:37:37,970 --> 01:37:40,359
l'm flattered.

1132
01:37:40,472 --> 01:37:43,066
You're a man of finance and politics,
Don Lucchesi.

1133
01:37:43,175 --> 01:37:45,063
These are things l don't understand.

1134
01:37:46,845 --> 01:37:48,073
You understand guns.

1135
01:37:49,014 --> 01:37:51,039
Finance is a gun.

1136
01:37:51,149 --> 01:37:55,745
Politics is knowing
when to pull the trigger.

1137
01:38:00,292 --> 01:38:01,520
How can l help?

1138
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:09,793
Blessed is the peacemaker...

1139
01:38:09,901 --> 01:38:12,790
for he can be called
the child of God.

1140
01:38:49,007 --> 01:38:52,568
l trusted this business arrangement
with the archbishop.

1141
01:38:52,678 --> 01:38:57,775
l trusted him. l was sure
his honesty was beyond a doubt.

1142
01:38:57,883 --> 01:39:03,173
But, as you see,
l'm now the victim of a swindle.

1143
01:39:03,288 --> 01:39:05,176
He's stalling me.

1144
01:39:05,290 --> 01:39:09,249
Vast money have gone to the pezzonovante
in high political places...

1145
01:39:09,361 --> 01:39:12,091
and the Vatican Bank
is the guarantor.

1146
01:39:12,197 --> 01:39:17,453
lf what you say is true,
there will be a great scandal.

1147
01:39:19,438 --> 01:39:24,569
Look at this stone. lt has been lying
in the water for a very long time...

1148
01:39:24,676 --> 01:39:28,567
but the water has not penetrated it.

1149
01:39:32,617 --> 01:39:36,508
Look, perfectly dry.

1150
01:39:37,756 --> 01:39:40,122
The same thing has happened
to men in Europe.

1151
01:39:40,225 --> 01:39:45,117
For centuries, they have been
surrounded by Christianity...

1152
01:39:45,230 --> 01:39:47,755
but Christ has not penetrated.

1153
01:39:47,866 --> 01:39:51,256
Christ doesn't live within them.

1154
01:39:55,307 --> 01:39:57,434
- What's happening?
- ls it possible...

1155
01:39:57,542 --> 01:40:00,466
that you could get me something sweet.

1156
01:40:00,579 --> 01:40:02,968
Orange juice, anything, a candy.

1157
01:40:06,551 --> 01:40:08,610
l have a little trouble with diabetes.

1158
01:40:12,591 --> 01:40:14,479
Blood sugar goes low.

1159
01:40:15,627 --> 01:40:17,515
l understand.

1160
01:40:40,018 --> 01:40:43,681
When l'm under stress,
sometimes this happens.

1161
01:40:43,789 --> 01:40:45,677
l understand.

1162
01:40:47,526 --> 01:40:50,916
To come to you
on such a delicate matter...

1163
01:40:54,065 --> 01:40:57,023
accusations against your archbishop.

1164
01:40:57,135 --> 01:40:59,194
lt was difficult for me.

1165
01:41:00,439 --> 01:41:02,634
The mind suffers...

1166
01:41:02,741 --> 01:41:06,370
and the body cries out.

1167
01:41:11,216 --> 01:41:13,275
That's true.

1168
01:41:14,753 --> 01:41:19,076
Would you like to make
your confession?

1169
01:41:25,730 --> 01:41:27,789
Your Eminence, l'm--

1170
01:41:31,603 --> 01:41:33,332
lt's been so long.

1171
01:41:33,438 --> 01:41:36,828
l wouldn't know where to--

1172
01:41:38,577 --> 01:41:40,465
lt's been 30 years.

1173
01:41:42,614 --> 01:41:45,105
l'd use up too much of your time,
l think.

1174
01:41:45,217 --> 01:41:48,311
l always have time to save souls.

1175
01:41:49,721 --> 01:41:52,610
Well, l'm beyond redemption.

1176
01:42:03,935 --> 01:42:08,895
l hear the confessions
of my own priests here.

1177
01:42:09,007 --> 01:42:12,829
Sometimes the desire to confess
is overwhelming...

1178
01:42:12,944 --> 01:42:15,333
and we must seize the moment.

1179
01:42:20,352 --> 01:42:24,880
What is the point of confessing
if l don't repent?

1180
01:42:26,591 --> 01:42:29,890
l hear you are a practical man.

1181
01:42:29,995 --> 01:42:33,055
What have you got to lose, huh?

1182
01:42:43,975 --> 01:42:46,205
Go on.

1183
01:42:52,150 --> 01:42:53,549
l...

1184
01:42:54,686 --> 01:42:56,574
betrayed my wife.

1185
01:42:58,223 --> 01:43:00,111
Go on, my son.

1186
01:43:05,530 --> 01:43:07,418
l betrayed myself.

1187
01:43:10,302 --> 01:43:12,190
l killed men.

1188
01:43:15,941 --> 01:43:18,330
And l ordered men to be killed.

1189
01:43:19,978 --> 01:43:21,866
Go on, my son, go on.

1190
01:43:28,019 --> 01:43:29,247
lt's useless.

1191
01:43:31,323 --> 01:43:33,211
Go on, my son.

1192
01:43:34,326 --> 01:43:36,214
l killed--

1193
01:43:40,966 --> 01:43:44,629
l ordered the death of my brother.

1194
01:43:44,736 --> 01:43:46,624
He injured me.

1195
01:43:48,039 --> 01:43:50,633
l killed my mother's son.

1196
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:54,103
l killed my father's son.

1197
01:44:04,823 --> 01:44:06,848
Your sins are terrible...

1198
01:44:06,958 --> 01:44:09,518
and it is just
that you suffer.

1199
01:44:10,795 --> 01:44:13,184
Your life could be redeemed...

1200
01:44:14,432 --> 01:44:16,320
but l know
that you don't believe that.

1201
01:44:16,434 --> 01:44:18,322
You will not change.

1202
01:45:13,925 --> 01:45:17,816
All my life
l kept trying to go up in society...

1203
01:45:19,064 --> 01:45:22,454
where everything higher up
was legal, straight.

1204
01:45:23,935 --> 01:45:26,995
But the higher l go,
the more crooked it becomes.

1205
01:45:30,275 --> 01:45:32,334
Where the hell does it end?

1206
01:45:41,419 --> 01:45:44,308
Killing each other
for centuries here.

1207
01:45:46,157 --> 01:45:50,514
For money, for pride, for family.

1208
01:45:53,598 --> 01:45:57,489
To keep from becoming the slaves
of the rich pezzonovante.

1209
01:46:04,642 --> 01:46:06,701
l made confession, Connie.

1210
01:46:07,812 --> 01:46:10,440
l confessed my sins.

1211
01:46:11,549 --> 01:46:14,040
Why, Michael?
That's not like you.

1212
01:46:14,152 --> 01:46:17,508
You don't have to confess your sins
to a stranger.

1213
01:46:17,622 --> 01:46:19,055
lt was the man.

1214
01:46:20,458 --> 01:46:22,585
A good man...

1215
01:46:22,694 --> 01:46:24,582
a true priest.

1216
01:46:28,299 --> 01:46:30,187
He can change things.

1217
01:46:35,573 --> 01:46:37,302
You know...

1218
01:46:37,408 --> 01:46:40,798
sometimes l think of poor Fredo--
drowned.

1219
01:46:42,380 --> 01:46:44,268
lt was God's will.

1220
01:46:46,151 --> 01:46:48,540
lt was a terrible accident.

1221
01:46:49,654 --> 01:46:51,542
But it's finished.

1222
01:46:56,961 --> 01:46:58,849
Michael, l love you.

1223
01:47:01,232 --> 01:47:03,120
l'll always help you.

1224
01:47:12,944 --> 01:47:14,832
lt's okay.

1225
01:49:54,973 --> 01:49:57,464
- Welcome.
- How are you?

1226
01:49:57,575 --> 01:50:01,067
- Mary, l missed you.
- l missed you too.

1227
01:50:01,179 --> 01:50:03,067
- Hello, Michael.
- Hello.

1228
01:50:03,181 --> 01:50:05,240
- Mom, look at this.
- What?

1229
01:50:06,918 --> 01:50:08,647
Oh, my--

1230
01:50:08,753 --> 01:50:10,880
You know, it's too bad
that Douglas couldn't be with us.

1231
01:50:10,989 --> 01:50:14,686
No, l know. He wanted to come very much,
but he had a very important trial.

1232
01:50:14,792 --> 01:50:17,920
- l know he wanted to come.
- l know.

1233
01:50:18,029 --> 01:50:19,917
- The car is--
- Okay.

1234
01:50:21,966 --> 01:50:26,027
Well, your son's an artist, huh?

1235
01:50:26,137 --> 01:50:28,230
Oh, yes, thanks to you.

1236
01:50:28,339 --> 01:50:29,738
Oh, what for?

1237
01:50:30,908 --> 01:50:33,172
For making me let him go.

1238
01:50:33,277 --> 01:50:35,165
Oh, well.

1239
01:50:35,279 --> 01:50:39,010
After all these years, here l am
in Sicily for the first time.

1240
01:50:39,117 --> 01:50:41,506
- l want a picture of you together.
- Okay.

1241
01:50:44,188 --> 01:50:46,076
Hey, Dad, smile.

1242
01:50:50,061 --> 01:50:53,292
l see you still have Al Neri.
Why?

1243
01:50:54,732 --> 01:50:58,964
Well, l need him. He helps me
get in and out of the car.

1244
01:50:59,070 --> 01:51:01,368
He carries my briefcase.

1245
01:51:01,472 --> 01:51:04,168
You're still a liar, Michael.

1246
01:51:04,275 --> 01:51:07,733
Let me show you Sicily--
the real Sicily.

1247
01:51:07,845 --> 01:51:10,643
Maybe you'll understand
the family history a little better.

1248
01:51:10,748 --> 01:51:13,137
l think l understand it well enough.

1249
01:52:05,169 --> 01:52:08,559
Anthony, l have something
you made for me...

1250
01:52:09,774 --> 01:52:11,662
a very long time ago.

1251
01:52:12,844 --> 01:52:15,972
- To bring you luck.
- Thanks.

1252
01:52:19,717 --> 01:52:21,275
You saved it, huh?

1253
01:52:21,385 --> 01:52:23,876
- Remember?
- l remember.

1254
01:52:26,424 --> 01:52:28,312
Thank you.

1255
01:52:30,595 --> 01:52:31,994
Proud of you.

1256
01:52:32,930 --> 01:52:34,488
Thank you.

1257
01:52:50,681 --> 01:52:53,309
- Are they as good as they look?
- They're better.

1258
01:52:53,417 --> 01:52:55,942
They're the best.

1259
01:52:56,053 --> 01:52:58,248
As long as they're around,
Uncle Michael is safe.

1260
01:52:58,389 --> 01:52:59,754
Good-bye.

1261
01:53:02,860 --> 01:53:04,816
Tell your father
l'll be back for dinner.

1262
01:53:06,597 --> 01:53:09,259
- Have fun.
- Tell Tony to be sure and wait for me.

1263
01:53:09,367 --> 01:53:11,995
Okay, l will.

1264
01:53:12,103 --> 01:53:14,401
Bye, Mom!

1265
01:53:14,505 --> 01:53:16,735
At your service.

1266
01:53:20,344 --> 01:53:23,734
lf l see Dad,
l'll tell him you left.

1267
01:53:28,953 --> 01:53:32,878
You're the only one left in this family
with my father's strength.

1268
01:53:35,126 --> 01:53:39,722
lf anything happens to Michael,
l want you to strike back.

1269
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:43,758
l'll have everything ready.

1270
01:53:47,538 --> 01:53:49,426
You swear?

1271
01:53:56,547 --> 01:53:58,606
l swear to you.

1272
01:54:28,813 --> 01:54:30,701
Here it is.

1273
01:54:32,116 --> 01:54:34,175
The house where my father was born.

1274
01:54:35,820 --> 01:54:40,211
This is where they came to take him
when he was a boy...

1275
01:54:40,324 --> 01:54:42,212
to kill him.

1276
01:54:44,528 --> 01:54:47,918
Wait, listen to that.

1277
01:55:08,185 --> 01:55:11,643
You know, Mary's in love.

1278
01:55:11,756 --> 01:55:14,281
Yes, l know.

1279
01:55:14,392 --> 01:55:19,523
With a handsome young ltalian man
with dark eyes.

1280
01:55:19,630 --> 01:55:21,518
l won't allow it.

1281
01:55:24,335 --> 01:55:28,032
lt's wrong.
lt's wrong, and it's dangerous.

1282
01:56:00,371 --> 01:56:02,032
Honor, huh?

1283
01:56:21,492 --> 01:56:24,450
You know, l remember the time
you came to my parents' house...

1284
01:56:24,562 --> 01:56:27,861
and you took me into that room
and told me about the family business...

1285
01:56:27,965 --> 01:56:31,662
and how you were never going to have
anything to do with it.

1286
01:56:31,769 --> 01:56:34,101
You sounded like Tony.

1287
01:56:34,205 --> 01:56:36,093
l was a lot like Tony.

1288
01:56:43,714 --> 01:56:46,672
- l can barely see. Kay.
- What?

1289
01:56:46,784 --> 01:56:49,446
- You mind driving?
- No. What's wrong?

1290
01:56:49,553 --> 01:56:53,182
My eyes-- sometimes
they're all right, and then--

1291
01:56:53,290 --> 01:56:56,418
- Sure.
- Listen, l have to see Don Tommasino.

1292
01:56:58,496 --> 01:57:00,259
Oh, my God!

1293
01:57:00,364 --> 01:57:01,763
Well--

1294
01:57:02,933 --> 01:57:06,323
- There's no bodyguards today.
- l really snuck away.

1295
01:57:59,523 --> 01:58:01,286
- How are you?
- Hi.

1296
01:58:01,392 --> 01:58:03,280
- Kay, this is Calo, my old friend.
- How do you do?

1297
01:58:03,394 --> 01:58:05,282
One of my bodyguards
in the old days.

1298
01:58:10,701 --> 01:58:12,100
- We can wait here.
- You want drink?

1299
01:58:12,203 --> 01:58:15,593
- Yes. Shall we go in?
- Sure.

1300
01:58:18,175 --> 01:58:20,564
l spent a lot of time in this room...

1301
01:58:22,913 --> 01:58:24,642
thinking of you.

1302
01:58:27,785 --> 01:58:30,345
And then you got married.

1303
01:58:33,524 --> 01:58:35,082
l still thought of you.

1304
01:58:35,860 --> 01:58:37,748
What's in that room?

1305
01:58:41,565 --> 01:58:45,854
l know this is dangerous for you.
This is Sicily.

1306
01:58:48,205 --> 01:58:50,594
- l love this country.
- Why?

1307
01:58:53,310 --> 01:58:56,666
Well, all through history...

1308
01:58:56,780 --> 01:58:59,112
terrible things
have happened to these people.

1309
01:58:59,216 --> 01:59:02,014
Terrible injustices.

1310
01:59:03,120 --> 01:59:08,353
But they still expect good
rather than bad will happen to them.

1311
01:59:08,459 --> 01:59:10,848
Sort of like me and you, huh?

1312
01:59:14,932 --> 01:59:18,288
- How so?
- l'm still here, right?

1313
01:59:18,402 --> 01:59:19,892
We do have a bad history.

1314
01:59:20,838 --> 01:59:24,262
- l'm still here.
- Yes, you are, but with dread.

1315
01:59:29,179 --> 01:59:30,942
Give me the order. Come on.

1316
01:59:31,048 --> 01:59:33,778
What is that supposed to do? ls that
supposed to make me not dread you?

1317
01:59:37,054 --> 01:59:39,443
We're in Sicily. lt's opera.

1318
01:59:41,859 --> 01:59:43,258
Okay.

1319
01:59:45,696 --> 01:59:47,755
What do we do now?

1320
01:59:50,568 --> 01:59:52,627
Be reasonable.

1321
01:59:52,736 --> 01:59:54,624
Let's try not to hurt each other.

1322
02:00:02,012 --> 02:00:03,900
l want you to forgive me.

1323
02:00:06,684 --> 02:00:07,742
For what?

1324
02:00:08,852 --> 02:00:10,410
Everything.

1325
02:00:14,692 --> 02:00:16,421
Like God, huh?

1326
02:00:17,661 --> 02:00:20,186
l need something a little closer.

1327
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,855
You couldn't understand
back in those days...

1328
02:00:27,738 --> 02:00:29,660
l loved my father.

1329
02:00:29,773 --> 02:00:32,662
l swore l would never be
a man like him...

1330
02:00:32,776 --> 02:00:35,267
but l loved him,
and he was in danger.

1331
02:00:35,379 --> 02:00:37,267
What could l do?

1332
02:00:37,381 --> 02:00:40,646
And then later
you were in danger.

1333
02:00:40,751 --> 02:00:45,176
Our children were in danger.
What could l do?

1334
02:00:45,289 --> 02:00:48,781
You were all that l... loved...

1335
02:00:48,892 --> 02:00:51,281
valued most in the world.

1336
02:00:52,396 --> 02:00:54,956
And now l'm losing you.
l lost you anyway.

1337
02:00:56,166 --> 02:00:58,054
You're gone...

1338
02:00:59,169 --> 02:01:01,399
and it was all for nothing.

1339
02:01:01,505 --> 02:01:02,904
So--

1340
02:01:06,744 --> 02:01:09,304
You have to understand...

1341
02:01:09,413 --> 02:01:11,904
l had a whole different
destiny planned.

1342
02:01:15,486 --> 02:01:17,681
All right, l'll stop.

1343
02:01:27,898 --> 02:01:31,595
l really don't know what you want
from me, Michael. l really don't know.

1344
02:01:31,702 --> 02:01:36,833
- l mean--
- l'm not the man that you think l am?

1345
02:01:38,375 --> 02:01:42,232
- l don't know.
- l love you, Kay.

1346
02:01:43,447 --> 02:01:46,405
Don't dread me anymore.

1347
02:01:51,355 --> 02:01:53,585
You know...

1348
02:01:53,691 --> 02:01:56,080
every night here in Sicily...

1349
02:01:57,327 --> 02:01:59,022
l dream...

1350
02:02:00,364 --> 02:02:02,753
about my wife
and my children...

1351
02:02:06,003 --> 02:02:08,426
and how l lost them.

1352
02:02:10,107 --> 02:02:13,702
l guess, if it's any consolation...

1353
02:02:13,811 --> 02:02:15,802
l want you to know that...

1354
02:02:19,183 --> 02:02:20,582
that...

1355
02:02:21,852 --> 02:02:24,241
l always loved you, Michael.

1356
02:02:25,589 --> 02:02:28,922
And, you know...

1357
02:02:29,026 --> 02:02:31,415
l always will.

1358
02:03:29,820 --> 02:03:31,549
lt never ends.

1359
02:05:03,847 --> 02:05:05,769
Frederick Keinszig...

1360
02:05:05,883 --> 02:05:08,215
known for a decade as ''God's banker''...

1361
02:05:08,318 --> 02:05:10,240
has been reported missing.

1362
02:05:10,354 --> 02:05:12,242
He was last seen three days ago...

1363
02:05:12,356 --> 02:05:13,755
leaving the Rome offices...

1364
02:05:13,857 --> 02:05:17,623
of a Vatican-owned corporation,
International Immobiliare.

1365
02:05:17,728 --> 02:05:19,753
Also missing was a large sum of money...

1366
02:05:19,863 --> 02:05:21,888
and several documents.

1367
02:05:21,999 --> 02:05:24,388
Come on, Keinszig, you fool.

1368
02:05:28,405 --> 02:05:30,794
Mr. Keinszig's absence casts
further suspicion...

1369
02:05:30,908 --> 02:05:33,331
on the dealings
of the Vatican Bank.

1370
02:05:33,443 --> 02:05:36,276
For several years, the bank
and its subsidiary companies...

1371
02:05:36,380 --> 02:05:40,840
have been the object of allegations
of disreputable business practices.

1372
02:05:43,153 --> 02:05:46,042
Will you please try and understand?

1373
02:05:47,157 --> 02:05:49,079
l have phoned him.

1374
02:05:49,192 --> 02:05:51,581
l have waited here by the phone.

1375
02:05:54,097 --> 02:05:58,830
You would do well to remember,
Mr. Lucchesi...

1376
02:05:58,936 --> 02:06:03,930
that this pope
has very different ideas...

1377
02:06:04,041 --> 02:06:05,997
from the last one.

1378
02:06:27,564 --> 02:06:29,953
Good-bye, my old friend.

1379
02:06:31,668 --> 02:06:34,057
You could've lived
a little longer.

1380
02:06:35,772 --> 02:06:38,661
l could be closer to my dream.

1381
02:06:44,581 --> 02:06:47,141
You were so loved, Don Tommasino.

1382
02:06:52,155 --> 02:06:56,046
Why was l so feared,
and you were so loved?

1383
02:06:57,160 --> 02:06:59,651
What was it?

1384
02:06:59,730 --> 02:07:01,618
l was no less honorable.

1385
02:07:03,766 --> 02:07:05,654
l wanted to do good.

1386
02:07:09,972 --> 02:07:12,861
What betrayed me?
My mind? My heart?

1387
02:07:15,911 --> 02:07:18,300
Why do l condemn myself so?

1388
02:07:24,820 --> 02:07:29,211
l swear on the lives of my children...

1389
02:07:33,829 --> 02:07:36,718
give me a chance
to redeem myself...

1390
02:07:40,603 --> 02:07:44,494
and l will sin no more.

1391
02:08:07,663 --> 02:08:12,555
You look pale.
Bad news? Tell me right away.

1392
02:08:14,236 --> 02:08:17,763
lt's not just a bad banking deal.

1393
02:08:17,873 --> 02:08:19,761
These guys are butchers.

1394
02:08:21,076 --> 02:08:22,964
What guys?

1395
02:08:23,078 --> 02:08:27,071
Lucchesi--
he controls all of them.

1396
02:08:27,183 --> 02:08:30,072
Altobello, the archbishop...

1397
02:08:31,187 --> 02:08:33,951
other people higher up,
P2, maybe.

1398
02:08:34,056 --> 02:08:37,913
Secret, unknown.
They're running things.

1399
02:08:40,830 --> 02:08:43,719
- l'm in their way.
- Yeah.

1400
02:08:43,833 --> 02:08:46,256
He's hired a professional assassin
to kill you.

1401
02:08:46,368 --> 02:08:47,926
He's Sicilian.

1402
02:08:48,037 --> 02:08:52,428
l don't know his name,
but they say he never fails.

1403
02:08:54,577 --> 02:08:56,465
Then no one is safe.

1404
02:08:59,515 --> 02:09:01,904
Even the new pope
is in danger.

1405
02:09:03,085 --> 02:09:06,976
We still have time.
We can prevent this.

1406
02:09:11,527 --> 02:09:13,415
l tried.

1407
02:09:15,998 --> 02:09:20,890
l tried to keep everything
from coming to this.

1408
02:09:22,071 --> 02:09:27,065
But it's not possible,
not in this world.

1409
02:09:28,177 --> 02:09:30,099
Give me the order.

1410
02:09:33,649 --> 02:09:35,537
You won't be able to go back.

1411
02:09:36,852 --> 02:09:39,980
- You'll be like me.
- Good.

1412
02:09:40,089 --> 02:09:43,513
All my life l wanted out.

1413
02:09:43,626 --> 02:09:45,514
l wanted the family out.

1414
02:09:47,363 --> 02:09:49,524
Well, l don't want out.

1415
02:09:49,632 --> 02:09:53,022
l want the power
to preserve the family.

1416
02:09:57,673 --> 02:09:59,561
l'm asking for the order.

1417
02:10:20,629 --> 02:10:22,517
lt's done.

1418
02:10:23,966 --> 02:10:25,888
Because l can't do it anymore.

1419
02:10:30,105 --> 02:10:32,437
Well, it doesn't matter.

1420
02:10:32,541 --> 02:10:35,806
Vincent knows what to do.
Come on outside.

1421
02:10:35,911 --> 02:10:39,335
Take a rest
and don't think about it.

1422
02:10:39,448 --> 02:10:42,337
- All l do is think about it.
- l'm your son.

1423
02:10:43,619 --> 02:10:45,507
Command me in all things.

1424
02:10:48,123 --> 02:10:50,011
Give up my daughter.

1425
02:10:53,095 --> 02:10:54,983
That's the price you pay...

1426
02:10:56,265 --> 02:10:58,995
for the life you choose.

1427
02:11:24,727 --> 02:11:26,615
Nephew...

1428
02:11:28,597 --> 02:11:30,485
from this moment on...

1429
02:11:32,434 --> 02:11:34,322
call yourself Vincent Corleone.

1430
02:11:39,441 --> 02:11:40,840
Sit.

1431
02:13:46,935 --> 02:13:50,063
l know how you feel about Michael...

1432
02:13:50,172 --> 02:13:52,003
but you can't save him.

1433
02:13:52,107 --> 02:13:53,995
He's lost.

1434
02:13:55,711 --> 02:13:57,201
Think of yourself.

1435
02:13:58,514 --> 02:14:00,903
What's your answer?

1436
02:14:03,118 --> 02:14:05,006
Enjoy the opera.

1437
02:14:07,055 --> 02:14:08,943
lt's all taken care of.

1438
02:14:13,795 --> 02:14:16,184
Check the bar.
l'll check the top floor.

1439
02:14:20,502 --> 02:14:23,391
''Here's hoping Tony sings better
at the Theatro Massimo...

1440
02:14:23,505 --> 02:14:25,894
than he does in the shower--
Love, Douglas.''

1441
02:14:27,676 --> 02:14:29,564
My darling, Costanza.

1442
02:14:32,314 --> 02:14:34,703
- This is a great occasion.
- Come, sit down.

1443
02:14:39,821 --> 02:14:41,709
Happy birthday.

1444
02:14:41,823 --> 02:14:44,348
You're 80 years old,
you don't look more than 60.

1445
02:14:44,459 --> 02:14:46,086
You're the only one
who remembered.

1446
02:14:46,195 --> 02:14:48,561
Michael, we just got the word.

1447
02:14:48,664 --> 02:14:51,861
The pope's ratifying
the lmmobiliare deal. We've won.

1448
02:14:51,967 --> 02:14:53,855
Congratulations.

1449
02:14:56,638 --> 02:14:59,027
How strange, the way things work.

1450
02:14:59,141 --> 02:15:02,531
The pope's doing exactly what you said
he'd do. He's cleaning house.

1451
02:15:04,046 --> 02:15:08,608
He should be careful.
lt's dangerous to be an honest man.

1452
02:15:14,089 --> 02:15:16,478
l wanna put more muscle backstage
with Tony.

1453
02:15:29,204 --> 02:15:32,594
On your birthday,
you used to shower me with treats.

1454
02:15:32,708 --> 02:15:34,596
Tootsie Rolls.

1455
02:15:35,711 --> 02:15:38,669
The nuns who made these cannolis
took a vow of silence.

1456
02:15:38,780 --> 02:15:41,340
They're the very finest.

1457
02:15:46,755 --> 02:15:48,154
Hey, cous.

1458
02:15:51,159 --> 02:15:52,592
Where's your leather?

1459
02:15:56,331 --> 02:15:57,764
Stop it.

1460
02:16:03,939 --> 02:16:06,828
You're so thin.
You eat it.

1461
02:16:30,732 --> 02:16:35,123
lt's over. There are things l have to do
that you can't be a part of.

1462
02:16:35,237 --> 02:16:38,331
Don't look at your father. lt's not
your father's decision. lt's mine.

1463
02:16:40,075 --> 02:16:42,464
Don't hate your father.

1464
02:16:44,246 --> 02:16:48,068
There are things l wanna be a part of,
you can't be around.

1465
02:16:50,118 --> 02:16:52,507
After tonight,
you won't see me anymore.

1466
02:16:57,326 --> 02:17:00,022
You gotta understand.
You gotta understand.

1467
02:17:01,897 --> 02:17:03,785
l'll always love you.

1468
02:17:16,712 --> 02:17:18,202
Love somebody else.

1469
02:17:40,969 --> 02:17:42,857
- To Tony.
- To Tony.

1470
02:20:59,701 --> 02:21:03,762
- They won't try.anything.
- Yeah, everything is fine. lt's clear.

1471
02:21:03,872 --> 02:21:06,932
l've already sent Al Neri
to the Vatican.

1472
02:23:56,344 --> 02:23:58,574
Check out the side.

1473
02:26:22,123 --> 02:26:25,012
Good. You got him.

1474
02:27:16,878 --> 02:27:19,267
Tonight the Corleone family
settles its accounts.

1475
02:27:20,381 --> 02:27:22,303
Keinszig...

1476
02:27:22,417 --> 02:27:25,875
that little Swiss banker fuck.

1477
02:27:25,987 --> 02:27:30,651
He's been swindling everyone
from the beginning. Fuck him.

1478
02:27:31,592 --> 02:27:33,480
Don Lucchesi, my friend...

1479
02:27:34,429 --> 02:27:37,353
Calo will pay him a visit
at his home.

1480
02:27:39,634 --> 02:27:42,523
Neri, take a train to Rome.

1481
02:27:44,605 --> 02:27:46,493
Light a candle
for the archbishop.

1482
02:29:49,897 --> 02:29:53,355
Michael, it's serious.
Our man inside the Vatican says...

1483
02:29:53,468 --> 02:29:54,867
there's a plot
against the pope.

1484
02:29:54,969 --> 02:29:57,130
You mean, he's gonna have
a heart attack?

1485
02:30:04,412 --> 02:30:09,304
This pope has powerful enemies.
We may not be in time to save him.

1486
02:30:12,553 --> 02:30:13,952
Let's go back to the opera.

1487
02:32:38,866 --> 02:32:39,924
Sleep.

1488
02:32:41,135 --> 02:32:43,023
Sleep, Godfather.

1489
02:36:32,366 --> 02:36:34,561
- l like this outfit.
- Yeah, l figured you would.

1490
02:36:34,668 --> 02:36:37,159
- Bravo. Say hello.
- Thank you.

1491
02:36:43,344 --> 02:36:45,574
- Did you like it?
- Great.

1492
02:36:47,414 --> 02:36:49,746
Let's get out of here.

1493
02:36:59,326 --> 02:37:03,092
- Can l please talk to you now?
- Not now, it's not a good time.

1494
02:37:03,197 --> 02:37:07,088
- You're just like my father.
- Come on, stay with the family. Go on.

1495
02:37:08,636 --> 02:37:10,399
- Talk to me.
- The twins are dead.

1496
02:37:10,504 --> 02:37:14,395
ln about one minute, there's gonna be
carabinieri crawling all over the place.

1497
02:37:15,709 --> 02:37:18,269
Okay. Let's get everybody
to the cars, nice and quiet.

1498
02:37:18,379 --> 02:37:20,267
- Got it.
- Quiet.

1499
02:37:34,895 --> 02:37:37,989
When they hear the name Corleone,
they're gonna think of a voice.

1500
02:37:47,942 --> 02:37:49,637
Dad.

1501
02:37:57,618 --> 02:37:59,108
This is my mom.

1502
02:38:08,462 --> 02:38:12,489
Dad, why are you doing this to me?

1503
02:38:21,542 --> 02:38:24,966
- Go on, move back. Go on, move back.
- Hey, move!

1504
02:38:25,079 --> 02:38:28,276
- You don't have to do this to me.
- Doing what?

1505
02:38:28,382 --> 02:38:30,976
What do you mean?

1506
02:38:31,085 --> 02:38:32,677
Mary, will you please--

1507
02:38:56,110 --> 02:38:57,168
Dad--

1508
02:39:15,996 --> 02:39:18,885
- Maybe she's not dead.
- Oh, God!

1509
02:39:23,003 --> 02:39:24,891
God, no, please!

1510
02:39:27,141 --> 02:39:28,540
Mom, come on.

1511
02:39:45,893 --> 02:39:47,292
Let her go.

1512
02:39:52,666 --> 02:39:54,554
Let go.
