It is now better than several years
since i moved to New York

3
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:03,362
and i haven't seen you
as much as i would like to.

4
00:02:03,503 --> 00:02:07,496
I hope you will come to this ceremony
of papal honours,

5
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,302
given for my charitable work.

6
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:15,712
The only weaith in this world is children.

7
00:02:15,848 --> 00:02:19,614
More than all the money and power
on earth.

8
00:02:19,752 --> 00:02:22,084
You are my treasure.

9
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:25,989

10
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:30,926
aithough i entrusted your education to
your mother for your own best interest,

11
00:02:31,064 --> 00:02:37,993
i look forward to seeing you, and to
a new period of harmony in our lives.

12
00:02:38,137 --> 00:02:43,370
perhaps you might prevail upon your
mother to come to this celebration,

13
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:49,607
and that from time to time, we can all
see each other at family functions.

14
00:02:49,749 --> 00:02:54,482
Anyway, i remain your loving father.

15
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,078

Holy Mary, mother of God,

19
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:12,655
Almighty God, bless the insignia

20
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:19,102
that it may contribute to the sacredness
of him to whom it is given.

21
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:38,681
Do you, Michael, promise to be faithful
to the noble purposes of this Order,

22
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:43,694
to have a special care for the poor,
the needy and those who are ill?

00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,730
i do so promise.

24
00:05:01,214 --> 00:05:04,047

and remain with you forever.

30
00:07:02,034 --> 00:07:06,767

31
00:07:06,906 --> 00:07:09,568
Joe, it's Vinnie. These are our guests.

32
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:12,200

Your son has something he wants to
talK to you about. i came here for him.

92
00:14:44,697 --> 00:14:50,397
- What's wrong with being a lawyer?
- He wants his life to be in music.

93
00:14:51,904 --> 00:14:56,273
Music is great, i love music.
But he should finish what he started.

94
00:14:56,408 --> 00:14:57,966
Anthony...

95
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,511

00:15:03,282 --> 00:15:06,683
What happens if you fail?

98
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:11,222
- i won't fail.
- Men always believe that.

99
00:15:11,357 --> 00:15:15,157
A law degree is liKe taKing

100
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:19,560
- After that you can worK for me...

101
00:15:20,432 --> 00:15:23,959
i have bad memories.

102
00:15:24,103 --> 00:15:26,571
Every family has bad memories.

103
00:15:30,342 --> 00:15:35,712
I'll always be your son, but won't have
anything to do with your business.

104
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:41,118
Anthony... finish the law degree.

105
00:15:42,354 --> 00:15:44,788
No.

106
00:16:01,006 --> 00:16:05,102
Well, that he got from you. That ''no''.

107
00:16:07,913 --> 00:16:13,476
- You could've helped me convince him.
- Convince him of what?

108
00:16:13,619 --> 00:16:15,746
Of what?

109
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:20,621
He throws his life away.
He throws greatness away.

110
00:16:21,693 --> 00:16:24,560
This is greatness?

111
00:16:24,696 --> 00:16:29,224
Now that you're so respectable,
you're more dangerous than ever.

112
00:16:29,368 --> 00:16:33,634
i preferred you when you were
just a common Mafia hood.

113
00:16:34,706 --> 00:16:36,970
OKay.

114
00:16:37,109 --> 00:16:40,510
- Can we talK common sense here?
- All right.

115
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:50,278
Tony Knows that you Killed Fredo.

116
00:16:56,595 --> 00:16:59,860
- What did you come here for?
- To protect my son.

117
00:16:59,998 --> 00:17:05,129
Not to see you disguised by your
church. That was a shameful ceremony.

118
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:12,206
i spent my life protecting my son.

119
00:17:12,344 --> 00:17:16,178
i spent my life protecting my family!

120
00:17:16,315 --> 00:17:19,512
Let's be reasonable, oKay?

121
00:17:19,651 --> 00:17:24,247
That's your big thing, isn't it, Michael?
Reason.

122
00:17:25,057 --> 00:17:30,324
- BacKed up by murder.
- Oh, God.

123
00:17:30,462 --> 00:17:33,659
- You hate me. You hate me.
- No.

124
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:35,960
i don't hate you.

125
00:17:37,536 --> 00:17:40,266
i dread you.

126
00:17:42,941 --> 00:17:49,073
i did what i could, Kay, to protect all
of you from the horrors of this world.

127
00:17:50,649 --> 00:17:54,141
But you became my horror.

128
00:18:02,628 --> 00:18:06,962
The children still love you, though.
Especially Mary.

129
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:11,367
That's something.

130
00:18:13,105 --> 00:18:17,701
We can build on that. For their saKe.

131
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:22,371
Let's try.

132
00:18:22,514 --> 00:18:27,281
Only if you let Tony go free to have
his own life, away from you.

133
00:18:34,092 --> 00:18:38,153
I'll let Tony go.

134
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:42,096
ThanK you.

135
00:19:15,934 --> 00:19:17,959
- Hi.

136
00:19:19,871 --> 00:19:25,275
You could hurt somebody with those.
Let me show you around.

137
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,571
Can you get me an interview
with Corleone?

138
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:33,583
No. I'm a relative, but i can't do that.
What else can i do for you?

139
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:36,449
- Handsome, but useless.
- Oh, yeah?

140
00:19:36,588 --> 00:19:39,557
- That's oKay, I'll gamble.

141
00:19:39,691 --> 00:19:43,422
Let's go to Atlantic City.
I'll show you how to gamble.

142
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:47,760

143
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:50,025

146
00:19:59,978 --> 00:20:02,469
- You Know him?
- Yeah, i do.

147
00:20:02,614 --> 00:20:07,517
His name is Anthony Squigilaro.
They call him ''The Ant''.

148
00:20:07,653 --> 00:20:10,986
He dips his bullets in cyanide.

149
00:20:19,297 --> 00:20:21,458
Don Aitobello.

150
00:20:22,634 --> 00:20:26,730

that i held you in these old hands.

155
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:56,763
Michael, I've lost all the venom,
all the juice of youth.

156
00:20:56,902 --> 00:21:02,602
I've lost the lust for women,
and now my mind is clear.

157
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:09,476
My duty to God is clear.
i have a special favour to asK of you.

158
00:21:10,682 --> 00:21:18,145
Can i attach my name
to the Vito Corleone Foundation,

159
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:24,251
so that you and i can be joined
in name and spirit?

160
00:21:25,897 --> 00:21:30,857
- One million dollars.
- Oh, my!

161
00:21:33,638 --> 00:21:38,507
- Godfather.
- Don Aitobello, you have such a heart.

162
00:21:40,612 --> 00:21:45,242
Come, let's go and sample
some of that old vino.

163
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,948
The Vatican Knows nothing
about these shareholders.

164
00:21:55,093 --> 00:21:56,321
Good.

165
00:21:56,461 --> 00:22:01,398
i have a tendency to worry. We've
increased our position substantially.

166
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:06,835
- Naturally, i worry.
- Stop worrying, we have an agreement.

167
00:22:06,972 --> 00:22:11,068
Good. How do you thinK
i got this grey hair?

168
00:22:11,209 --> 00:22:15,873
Two seconds... ThanK you for your
contribution to the swimming-pool.

169
00:22:16,014 --> 00:22:20,212
We need your help on Sam Wallace's
candidacy for judgeship.

170
00:22:20,352 --> 00:22:22,650
- We can always use a good judge.
- ThanKs.

171
00:22:22,788 --> 00:22:24,449
Andrew!

172
00:22:24,589 --> 00:22:28,787
My godson Andrew Hagen.
My brother Tom's eldest boy.

173
00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:33,057
He's been assistant to Bishop Breelan
for three years.

174
00:22:33,198 --> 00:22:37,532
- Hopes to be assigned to the Vatican.
- Rome needs fine young priests.

175
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:41,264
His mother Theresa Hagen,
Bishop Gilday.

176
00:22:41,406 --> 00:22:42,805
Honoured to meet you.

177
00:22:42,941 --> 00:22:47,401
Mr Corleone. Hi. Grace Hamiiton.

178
00:22:47,546 --> 00:22:52,313
Vincent Mancini promised to tell you
about me. That maybe you'd see me.

179
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:55,749
- Did Vincent Mancini call about her?
- No.

180
00:22:55,887 --> 00:22:59,084
- You promised to stay out there, twice.
- i Know.

181
00:23:01,126 --> 00:23:04,994
Joey Zasa showed up.
He's waiting in the lobby.

182
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:09,123
He wants to personally
congratulate you. Show his respect.

183
00:23:09,267 --> 00:23:15,604
- Do i have to see him?
- He says you're his patron.

184
00:23:17,976 --> 00:23:20,706
Hey, Vinnie!

185
00:23:20,846 --> 00:23:23,576
- Who's your favourite aunt?
- You are.

186
00:23:26,151 --> 00:23:30,417
Today I'll talK to Michael
about your little problem.

187
00:23:30,555 --> 00:23:34,992
if you'd warned me, i would have
worn a better suit.

188
00:23:35,126 --> 00:23:38,118
The Meucci Association
has elected you

189
00:23:38,263 --> 00:23:41,096
italian-American Man of the Year.

190
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:44,629
Meucci...

191
00:23:47,138 --> 00:23:48,400
Who's Meucci?

192
00:23:49,841 --> 00:23:56,371
The italian-American who invented
the telephone, one year before Bell.

193
00:23:59,718 --> 00:24:02,687
And this is the reason
you've come today?

194
00:24:09,995 --> 00:24:11,656
l...

195
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:16,733
I've got a stone in my shoe.

196
00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:21,332
A two-bit punK who worKs for me.

197
00:24:21,473 --> 00:24:26,001
The one who thinKs he's related to you.

198
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,110
A bastard.

199
00:24:32,651 --> 00:24:37,054
He's here. Vincent Mancini.
He's at the party.

200
00:24:40,358 --> 00:24:42,053
Bring him in.

201
00:24:43,328 --> 00:24:46,695
i thinK it's good that we talK.

202
00:24:46,831 --> 00:24:48,799
No, grazie.

203
00:24:50,602 --> 00:24:52,934
i have a problem...

204
00:24:53,071 --> 00:24:59,442
...and i want to find out if it is
my problem or your problem.

205
00:24:59,577 --> 00:25:05,140
Your business is your business. i have
no interests or percentages from it.

206
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:09,946
Good. Then it's my problem.

207
00:25:13,391 --> 00:25:17,589
Michael, you Know Vincent Mancini.
Sonny's boy.

208
00:25:19,998 --> 00:25:22,990
- How are you, Mr Corleone?
- How are you?

209
00:25:23,134 --> 00:25:26,831
- Good. How are you? Good party.
- You liKe it?

210
00:25:26,972 --> 00:25:30,203
- Yes, i had to sneaK in.
- You're dressed for it.

211
00:25:34,913 --> 00:25:40,977
So, what's the trouble
between you and Mr Joe Zasa?

212
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:45,283
- Just trouble. I'll taKe care of it.
- That's foolish of you.

213
00:25:45,423 --> 00:25:51,794
Foolish of me? it's a little foolish
of this guy, don't you thinK? Right?

214
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:55,798
- Right?!
- Temper liKe his father...

215
00:25:55,934 --> 00:25:57,424
Vincent...

216
00:25:58,903 --> 00:26:03,397
Mr Joe Zasa now owns what used to
be the Corleone business in New YorK.

217
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:08,979
Out of Kindness, he gave you
a job in his family.

218
00:26:09,114 --> 00:26:11,878
You tooK it against my advice.

219
00:26:12,017 --> 00:26:17,182
i offered you something better in the
legitimate world. You turned me down.

220
00:26:17,322 --> 00:26:22,282
Now you both come to me with this bad
blood. What do you expect me to do?

221
00:26:24,295 --> 00:26:26,320
- Am i a gangster?
- No...

222
00:26:26,464 --> 00:26:30,833
That was Papa's neighbourhood.
Zasa runs it liKe a disgrace!

223
00:26:30,969 --> 00:26:34,496
- That's the past, Connie.
- i earned that territory.

224
00:26:34,639 --> 00:26:38,473
The Commission gave it to me
and you approved.

225
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:39,907
Yes.

226
00:26:40,045 --> 00:26:44,982
i came for the party, not to asK for help.
i could Kill this bastard.

227
00:26:45,116 --> 00:26:47,175
So Kill him.

228
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:50,754
What does all this have to do with me?

229
00:26:50,889 --> 00:26:56,225
Well, he goes behind your bacK,
saying ''FucK Michael Corleone''.

230
00:26:56,361 --> 00:26:58,852
Say it to his face, one time!

231
00:27:00,632 --> 00:27:05,365
Mr Corleone, all bastards are liars.
ShaKespeare wrote poems about it.

232
00:27:05,503 --> 00:27:09,439
What am i going to do with this guy?!

233
00:27:15,146 --> 00:27:19,879
Joey, if there's some guy
running around this city,

234
00:27:20,018 --> 00:27:22,248
saying ''FucK Michael Corleone''...

235
00:27:23,988 --> 00:27:29,290
...what do we do
with a piece of shit liKe that?

236
00:27:29,427 --> 00:27:30,985
He's a fucKing dog.

237
00:27:38,703 --> 00:27:42,195
Yes, it's true. if anyone would say
such a thing,

238
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,776
they would not be a friend,
they would be a dog.

239
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:58,048
- My interests don't conflict with his.
- You don't Know how much they do.

240
00:27:58,189 --> 00:27:59,588
Quiet, Vincent.

241
00:27:59,724 --> 00:28:02,022
He needs your support!

242
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,721
Don't let me worK for this guy,
let me worK for you.

243
00:28:05,864 --> 00:28:12,326
As what? Tough guy? i don't need
tough guys. i need more lawyers.

244
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:20,667
Since we have no conflicts or debts,
i accept your tribute. i wish you well.

245
00:28:22,213 --> 00:28:26,673
Vincent, maKe your peace
with Mr Joe Zasa. Go on.

246
00:28:37,629 --> 00:28:39,995
Bastardo...

247
00:28:44,869 --> 00:28:48,168
Vinnie, what's the matter with you?!

248
00:28:48,306 --> 00:28:50,297
Get him out of here.

249
00:28:51,576 --> 00:28:54,545
Jesus Christ...

250
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:58,012
- i told Connie this wasn't the right time.
- Close it.

251
00:28:58,149 --> 00:29:01,778
i Know you're into Wall Street,
but you're still the final word.

252
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,855
i want to protect you from these guys.
Your lawyers can't.

253
00:29:04,989 --> 00:29:08,516
- But you can?
- Yeah, i can do that.

254
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,251
Why should i be afraid of Zasa?

255
00:29:11,396 --> 00:29:14,627
You stop him from rising
in the Commission.

256
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:18,065
i say we maKe him dead.
Give me the order, I'll do it.

257
00:29:18,203 --> 00:29:20,103
- You'll do it?
- Yeah.

258
00:29:24,442 --> 00:29:29,243
Maybe you should come with me
for a few weeKs. See what happens.

259
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,508
- OKay.
- See if you learn.

260
00:29:33,518 --> 00:29:36,851
And we'll talK about your future.

261
00:29:37,722 --> 00:29:40,088
i won't let you down.

262
00:29:45,997 --> 00:29:48,261
it's about ready.

263
00:29:54,205 --> 00:29:56,571
What happened?

264
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:59,370
if I'm in a room with Zasa,
what happens? i bit his ear off.

265
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:02,911
Here we go. Watch the card.

266
00:30:05,149 --> 00:30:06,377
Hold it!

267
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,617
- Vincent...
- Yeah.

268
00:30:10,755 --> 00:30:13,189
TaKe the picture with us.

269
00:30:20,265 --> 00:30:22,256
Nice jacKet.

270
00:30:23,935 --> 00:30:26,460
Closer to the centre, sir.

271
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:31,470
Smile!

272
00:30:50,528 --> 00:30:56,489
Godfather, this is the caKe for you
and your family from Enzo the baKer.

273
00:30:56,634 --> 00:30:59,501
Do you want to do it?

274
00:31:43,748 --> 00:31:47,206
Cent'anni! Cent'anni!

275
00:32:47,211 --> 00:32:51,011
- Vincent?
- What do you want, sweetheart?

276
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:55,580
Do you love me?

277
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,054
- Come on, go to bed.
- Come on, say it.

278
00:33:00,191 --> 00:33:02,557
i love you.

279
00:33:02,693 --> 00:33:05,253
i love you, too.

280
00:33:07,198 --> 00:33:09,132
You've got a cat?

281
00:33:15,706 --> 00:33:19,472
Go get us some water, I'm thirsty.
Come on.

282
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,077
Come on.

283
00:33:28,152 --> 00:33:31,986
Well, i guess i Know my place.

284
00:33:32,123 --> 00:33:35,615
i can't believe I'm actually doing this.

285
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,060
''Get me water, baKe me a caKe''...
What happened to ''please''?

286
00:34:27,645 --> 00:34:30,478
Good boy, SacKface. Go for a walK.

287
00:34:39,123 --> 00:34:42,354
- Let her go.
- Cut her throat, man.

288
00:34:44,862 --> 00:34:48,423
- What did you say?
- Cut her fucKing throat.

289
00:34:50,935 --> 00:34:54,268
- OKay, chief...
- Drop your gun or he'll cut her throat.

290
00:34:54,405 --> 00:34:58,034
i hardly Know her, so cut her.
What the fucK do i care?

291
00:35:00,545 --> 00:35:04,106
You've got no choice. She'll be dead.

292
00:35:04,248 --> 00:35:08,184
if you do, I'll Kill you both.
Give up that Knife, I'll let you go.

293
00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:11,880
Cut her throat! Right now!

294
00:35:12,023 --> 00:35:17,791
I'll do something that'll convince you.
Don't get frightened. Just watch me.

295
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:25,425
Oh, shit!

296
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,902
Drop the Knife. Drop it!

297
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:35,036
Good boy. Sit down, i want to talK
to you. it was a wise choice. Sit down.

298
00:35:35,179 --> 00:35:36,976
Lose the masK.

299
00:35:39,984 --> 00:35:42,885
Relax, have a smoKe. You smoKe?

300
00:35:45,122 --> 00:35:48,353
Whose idea was this? Who sent you?

301
00:35:48,492 --> 00:35:51,256
Tell me who sent you.

302
00:35:53,397 --> 00:35:56,298
- No one.
- Did you taKe a looK at this guy?

303
00:35:56,434 --> 00:35:58,527
- Yeah.
- Who sent you?

304
00:36:01,572 --> 00:36:03,563
it was Joey Zasa.

305
00:36:18,255 --> 00:36:20,485
Are you oKay?

306
00:36:22,994 --> 00:36:26,191
- You were going to let them Kill me!
- No, i wasn't...

307
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:29,788
You pig! You sicK fucK!

308
00:36:31,068 --> 00:36:35,437
You wanted gambling. That's gambling.
Call the police.

309
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:43,536
- You Killed the other guy too?
- He went for my gun.

310
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:47,048
it was seif-defence.
Go ahead, call the police.

311
00:36:48,052 --> 00:36:50,043
- No, no...
- I'm taKing pictures.

312
00:36:50,187 --> 00:36:51,984
No pictures.

313
00:36:53,691 --> 00:36:55,124
You had a gun!

314
00:36:55,259 --> 00:37:00,356
They only had a Knife. You could have
handed them over to the police.

315
00:37:00,498 --> 00:37:04,457
Zasa sent them.
i just sent him a message.

316
00:37:05,336 --> 00:37:10,603
- Now he has to send you one bacK.
- ls Zasa going to send me one bacK?

317
00:37:10,741 --> 00:37:13,642
He did the right thing.
He got Zasa's name!

318
00:37:13,778 --> 00:37:21,014
What has Joey Zasa to do
with anything? Joey Zasa is a pazzo.

319
00:37:21,152 --> 00:37:23,746
All right. You are what you are.

320
00:37:23,888 --> 00:37:27,187
it's your nature. Stay close to me.

321
00:37:27,324 --> 00:37:31,158
Don't do anything. Keep your mouth
shut and your eyes open.

322
00:37:31,295 --> 00:37:34,492
- And you do what i tell you.
- i understand.

323
00:37:34,632 --> 00:37:38,659
- i have problems with the Commission.
- i Know.

324
00:37:38,803 --> 00:37:43,604
- You don't maKe them easier.
- it wasn't my idea that this happened.

325
00:37:43,741 --> 00:37:46,676
- Get out of here.
- Michael...

326
00:37:46,811 --> 00:37:49,211
Yes?

327
00:37:49,346 --> 00:37:54,249
- Now they'll fear you.
- Maybe they should fear you.

328
00:37:57,154 --> 00:38:01,215
- B.J., what's up?
- The Archbishop just called bacK.

329
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:04,293
We've arranged some amazing things.

330
00:38:04,428 --> 00:38:09,263
The publicity is phenomenal. You're the
new RocKefeller. A philanthropist.

331
00:38:10,768 --> 00:38:14,499
- Sign here, please.
- Times do change, don't they?

332
00:38:14,638 --> 00:38:20,235
My father hated foundations.
He loved doing it by himseif.

333
00:38:20,377 --> 00:38:23,005
Man to man. But we're different.

334
00:38:23,147 --> 00:38:28,483
No different than any large corporation.
We control a lot of money with little.

335
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:33,522
Minimise taxes.
With no government control.

336
00:38:41,832 --> 00:38:45,632
- Godfather.
- Andrew.

337
00:38:47,071 --> 00:38:51,735
- Off to Rome...
- i wanted to thanK you for everything.

338
00:38:51,876 --> 00:38:55,277
- Do you want some breaKfast?
- ThanKs, i can't.

339
00:38:55,412 --> 00:39:00,372
- How's your italian?
- Devo fare un po' di pratica.

340
00:39:00,518 --> 00:39:02,713
- His father was a great lawyer.
- i Know.

341
00:39:02,853 --> 00:39:07,586
Didn't live to see him ordained. i did.
Did you ever see one of those?

342
00:39:07,725 --> 00:39:11,422
Beautiful. i was so proud.
Let me walK you out.

343
00:39:12,496 --> 00:39:14,964
if you hear any rumours in the Vatican,
let me Know.

344
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:18,296
No, Andrew has the true faith.

345
00:39:27,378 --> 00:39:29,346
Don Corleone,

346
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:35,043
i need your help. And not just
to light a little candle.

347
00:39:35,186 --> 00:39:43,025
My gift was to be able to persuade
people to give to the Holy Church.

348
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:47,961
Then Rome decides to put me
in charge of the Vatican BanK...

349
00:39:50,134 --> 00:39:53,297
...but i was never a true banKer.

350
00:39:55,973 --> 00:40:01,377
Mea culpa. i trusted my friends.

351
00:40:01,512 --> 00:40:04,538
Friendship and money...

352
00:40:04,682 --> 00:40:06,411
Oil and water...

353
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,279
lndeed.

354
00:40:08,419 --> 00:40:16,349
But these ''friends'' used the good name
of the Church to feed their greed.

355
00:40:16,493 --> 00:40:19,951
if money was lost...

356
00:40:20,097 --> 00:40:23,362
...then i am to blame.

357
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:29,234
if only prayer could pay off
our 700 million dollar deficit.

358
00:40:30,975 --> 00:40:33,603
769 million...

359
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:45,380
The Church owns 25 percent
of a large corporation: lmmobiliare.

360
00:40:45,522 --> 00:40:47,547
You Know the one i mean?

361
00:40:47,691 --> 00:40:52,993
Largest landlord on Earth.
Real estate worth six billion dollars.

362
00:40:54,665 --> 00:40:56,462
That's true.

363
00:40:57,234 --> 00:41:00,795
And the Vatican vote
is necessary for control.

364
00:41:03,407 --> 00:41:06,570
No, you're mistaKen.

365
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:11,079
This isn't a question of one person
deciding. One deciding vote.

366
00:41:11,215 --> 00:41:17,017
This is liKe any other company.
We have directors and very old rules.

367
00:41:18,055 --> 00:41:22,992
The Pope himseif
would have to approve you.

368
00:41:27,097 --> 00:41:30,658
We've sold the casinos.

369
00:41:30,801 --> 00:41:34,669
All businesses having to do
with gambling.

370
00:41:34,805 --> 00:41:40,505
We have no interests or investments
in anything illegitimate.

371
00:41:43,547 --> 00:41:47,745
The Corleones are prepared to deposit
500 million dollars in the Vatican BanK

372
00:41:47,885 --> 00:41:50,581
when Mr Corleone receives majority
control of lmmobiliare.

373
00:41:50,721 --> 00:41:58,253
lmmobiliare could be something new.
A European conglomerate.

374
00:41:58,395 --> 00:42:02,593
Few families have control
of such a company.

375
00:42:05,836 --> 00:42:08,828
it seems that, in today's world,

376
00:42:08,973 --> 00:42:15,310
the power to absolve debt is greater
than the power of forgiveness.

377
00:42:15,446 --> 00:42:17,311
600 million dollars.

378
00:42:22,386 --> 00:42:26,015
Don't overestimate
the power of forgiveness.

379
00:42:27,658 --> 00:42:29,558
Don Corleone,

380
00:42:29,693 --> 00:42:34,892
this deal with lmmobiliare can maKe you
one of the richest men in the world.

381
00:42:35,032 --> 00:42:41,631
Your whole past history, and the history
of your family, would be washed away.

382
00:42:44,408 --> 00:42:47,138
600 million.

383
00:43:02,126 --> 00:43:06,893
The motion under discussion
relates to Corleone Group's proposal

384
00:43:07,031 --> 00:43:12,901
to acquire 1 00,000,000 newly issued
Class A voting shares.

385
00:43:14,338 --> 00:43:21,301
... Corleone capital invested directly
into lnternational lmmobiliare,

386
00:43:21,445 --> 00:43:25,575
an old and respected
European company.

387
00:43:25,716 --> 00:43:31,211
Mr Corleone's ambitious programme
to expand this real estate company

388
00:43:31,355 --> 00:43:34,756
into an international conglomerate...

389
00:43:34,892 --> 00:43:37,087
lMMOBlLlARE TAKEOVER LlKELY
STOCK SOARS

390
00:43:37,227 --> 00:43:42,290
...by Eastern techniques of efficiency
and focus and unlimited...

391
00:43:43,067 --> 00:43:45,661
Mr Corleone, excuse me.

392
00:43:45,803 --> 00:43:49,295
Didn't you recently deposit 200 million
in the Vatican BanK,

393
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,432
which is affiliated with lmmobiliare?

394
00:43:52,576 --> 00:43:54,305
True. Why not?

395
00:43:54,445 --> 00:44:00,645
Wasn't there any questioning about
the timing on this particular deposit?

396
00:44:00,784 --> 00:44:04,515
Mr Chairman, if i may?

397
00:44:04,655 --> 00:44:09,251
The Vito Andolini Corleone Foundation,
of which Mary Corleone is chairman,

398
00:44:09,393 --> 00:44:12,829
has made an endowment
of 1 00 million dollars.

399
00:44:12,963 --> 00:44:17,229
The money comes from his own family
and will be administered by the Vatican.

400
00:44:17,367 --> 00:44:19,927
Does that answer your question?

401
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:26,737
i have always believed that helping your
fellow man is profitable in every sense,

402
00:44:26,877 --> 00:44:29,243
personally and bottom line.

403
00:44:29,913 --> 00:44:35,317
My fellow shareholders, if Europe
and America can learn to co-operate,

404
00:44:35,452 --> 00:44:39,286
if we can learn to pool our weaith,
share our marKets,

405
00:44:39,423 --> 00:44:45,328
we can defeat any competition
anywhere in the world.

406
00:44:45,462 --> 00:44:47,930
ThanK you for your time.

407
00:44:48,065 --> 00:44:52,593
i hope that you will looK favourably
on my proposal. ThanK you.

408
00:44:58,909 --> 00:45:01,343
Let me have this microphone here.

409
00:45:01,478 --> 00:45:06,916
Wili we let a criminai run our company?
He's got the map of Sicily on his face!

410
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:08,381
Order!

411
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:11,579
He's either a Catholic or a mafioso...

412
00:45:13,557 --> 00:45:18,688
The Hamiiton lnvestors Group
cannot support this proposal.

413
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:21,161
Your excellency...

414
00:45:21,298 --> 00:45:23,391
Mr Chairman...

415
00:45:23,534 --> 00:45:31,407
...the Vatican BanK feels
that lnternationai lmmobiliare...

416
00:45:31,542 --> 00:45:35,672
...wili be safe in Mr Corleone's hands.

417
00:45:35,812 --> 00:45:41,011
...subject to audit and finai ratification,
which must taKe place in Rome.

418
00:45:41,151 --> 00:45:45,281
Please join me in welcoming
Mr Michaei Corleone.

419
00:45:55,232 --> 00:45:56,824
Dad?

420
00:45:59,136 --> 00:46:04,130
Tony says that I'm a front
for the foundation.

421
00:46:04,274 --> 00:46:07,835
That you're using me to puli the strings.

422
00:46:07,978 --> 00:46:11,175
- To get the money where you want it.
- Please!

423
00:46:11,315 --> 00:46:14,307
- To shine up your public image.
- Mary!

424
00:46:15,485 --> 00:46:19,819
Mary, this is real.
This foundation is real.

425
00:46:21,792 --> 00:46:26,991
l wanted Anthony to be part of it.
l thought you would be together on this.

426
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:31,464
l won't interfere.
l'li help, but only if you asK.

427
00:46:31,602 --> 00:46:34,332
What is this really for?

428
00:46:34,471 --> 00:46:39,306
Why are you doing this?
Why am i doing this?

429
00:46:39,443 --> 00:46:44,437
I'm doing this for my children.
You're doing it for your children too.

430
00:46:45,082 --> 00:46:48,245
This foundation is supposed to
help all people?

431
00:46:48,385 --> 00:46:50,717
That's the purpose.

432
00:46:50,854 --> 00:46:55,450
This is legitimate.
Mary, i swear, this is legitimate.

433
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:03,066
Dad, i want this to bring me
closer to you.

434
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:15,569
i would burn in hell to Keep you safe.

435
00:47:29,059 --> 00:47:31,755
Go in the other car. I'll ride with Michael.

436
00:47:31,895 --> 00:47:33,920
Go, go, go.

437
00:47:47,911 --> 00:47:53,679
As your family's oldest friend, I'm
always chosen to bring you messages.

438
00:47:56,119 --> 00:47:59,486
Tell me, Don Aitobello.

439
00:48:00,957 --> 00:48:05,860
Your old partners are grateful for
the money you made them.

440
00:48:05,996 --> 00:48:08,157
They worship you...

441
00:48:08,298 --> 00:48:14,828
...but their hearts are broKen, because
they thinK you abandoned them.

442
00:48:14,971 --> 00:48:21,501
They want to share your deal
on lmmobiliare, to be a family again.

443
00:48:21,645 --> 00:48:25,137
it can purify their money.

444
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:28,611
This i cannot do.

445
00:48:31,088 --> 00:48:34,819
lmmobiliare must be legitimate.

446
00:48:35,926 --> 00:48:38,588
i Know.

447
00:48:38,729 --> 00:48:42,324
But they're unhappy.

448
00:48:42,999 --> 00:48:44,762
And you?

449
00:48:44,901 --> 00:48:51,067
i asK nothing for myseif.
Only peace in my old age.

450
00:48:51,208 --> 00:48:55,372
But i must please the world around me.

451
00:48:56,413 --> 00:49:02,875
Michael, your father was a
reasonable man. Learn from him.

452
00:49:04,821 --> 00:49:09,758
i learned many things from my father.

453
00:49:13,597 --> 00:49:20,366
Call a meeting, my friend,
so there are no debts or grudges.

454
00:49:20,504 --> 00:49:23,996
We will maKe the peace, you and l.

455
00:49:31,548 --> 00:49:33,379
The Vatican announced today...

456
00:49:33,517 --> 00:49:37,886
that pope paul Vl has canceled
his Sunday blessing...

457
00:49:38,021 --> 00:49:40,421
due to ill heaith.

458
00:49:40,557 --> 00:49:46,189
His physician has ordered
total bedrest...

459
00:49:46,329 --> 00:49:49,059
and cessation of all activities.

460
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:10,076
They've had a press conference. The
Pope's condition is grave. ''Gravissimo. ''

461
00:50:37,214 --> 00:50:40,843
The purpose of this meeting
is to ratify...

462
00:50:40,984 --> 00:50:45,683
the motion passed by our
shareholders in New YorK.

463
00:50:45,822 --> 00:50:48,222
Please...

464
00:50:48,358 --> 00:50:52,920
Our group represents a consortium
of Catholic businessmen

465
00:50:53,063 --> 00:50:56,157
against the Corleone control.

466
00:50:56,867 --> 00:51:01,668
The Vatican has cast its vote. Corleone
Group already controls the Board.

467
00:51:01,805 --> 00:51:06,742
According to the Lateran Treaty,
the Vatican vote must be ratified here.

468
00:51:06,877 --> 00:51:09,437
Here in Rome, by the Pope.

469
00:51:13,149 --> 00:51:17,586
The Pope is gravely ill.

470
00:51:17,721 --> 00:51:22,488
Until he recovers, i am powerless.

471
00:51:22,626 --> 00:51:25,322
- What if he dies?
- Then...

472
00:51:26,429 --> 00:51:29,421
...as you Americans say,
all bets are off.

473
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,400
Gentlemen, please.

474
00:51:33,336 --> 00:51:37,534
This is a brief delay. Nothing more.

475
00:51:41,745 --> 00:51:45,237
Your Excellency, gentlemen...

476
00:51:45,382 --> 00:51:51,946
i advise you to join us in our prayers
for the Holy Father's recovery.

477
00:51:52,088 --> 00:51:53,749
We had an agreement!

478
00:51:55,158 --> 00:51:58,924
This meeting was to be
merely a formality.

479
00:51:59,062 --> 00:52:04,329
- Please sit down.
- I'd rather stand. Give me an answer.

480
00:52:04,467 --> 00:52:09,905
The lmmobiliare has its roots in the
European tradition. Please understand.

481
00:52:10,774 --> 00:52:14,210
i understand.
Your tactics are despicable.

482
00:52:14,344 --> 00:52:17,279
That's quite an indictment,
coming from a Corleone.

483
00:52:17,414 --> 00:52:22,716
- Gentlemen, gentlemen!
- Remember you are in the Vatican.

484
00:52:25,722 --> 00:52:32,184
- What is it that you want?
- Yes, you will taKe control.

485
00:52:32,329 --> 00:52:36,390
We'll gladly put you at the helm
of our little fleet,

486
00:52:36,533 --> 00:52:40,526
but our ships must all sail
in the same direction.

487
00:52:42,105 --> 00:52:49,739
Otherwise, who can say how long
your stay with us will last?

488
00:52:49,879 --> 00:52:57,786
it's not personal. it's only business.
You should Know, Godfather.

489
00:52:59,723 --> 00:53:01,088
Very well.

490
00:53:02,425 --> 00:53:07,260
You want to do business with me?
i will do business with you.

491
00:53:08,198 --> 00:53:11,167
Vipers, all of them.

492
00:53:16,606 --> 00:53:19,541
- We're bacK with the Borgias!
- Uncle Michael...

493
00:53:19,676 --> 00:53:22,702
- Andrew!
- i heard you were here.

494
00:53:22,846 --> 00:53:27,283
it's so nice to see you.
Vincent, it's so nice.

495
00:53:27,417 --> 00:53:30,113
What is this about the Borgias?
Those days are over.

496
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:39,458
- Recognise it?
- Yeah.

497
00:53:39,596 --> 00:53:45,933
Genco Olive Oil. That's where our
grandfather started as a delivery boy.

498
00:53:46,069 --> 00:53:47,730
Three years later he owned it.

499
00:53:48,438 --> 00:53:51,669
- Only in America.
- That's it.

500
00:53:51,808 --> 00:53:56,768
Vincenzo, where have you been hiding?
We need your help so badly.

501
00:53:56,913 --> 00:54:00,872
- What can i do for you?
- Get rid of Joe Zasa. He sells drugs...

502
00:54:01,017 --> 00:54:05,681
Now that I'm an older woman,
I'm afraid to go out at night.

503
00:54:05,822 --> 00:54:08,188
Where should they be now?

504
00:54:08,324 --> 00:54:13,057
- Lou, what's going on?
- We're late.

505
00:54:13,196 --> 00:54:16,029
- Have i ever let you down?
- i trust you.

506
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:18,532
- Don't worry.
- ThanK you.

507
00:54:18,668 --> 00:54:20,363
Enjoy yourselves.

508
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:31,638
- What was that?
- The neighbourhood's in trouble.

509
00:54:31,781 --> 00:54:34,716
- Do you Keep an eye out for them?
- Yes.

510
00:54:34,851 --> 00:54:37,649
- And for me?
- From now on.

511
00:54:38,722 --> 00:54:42,715
- I've missed you all this time.
- i missed you too, cousin.

512
00:54:42,859 --> 00:54:48,058
i missed growing up with my cousins.
i didn't even Know you, but missed you.

513
00:54:48,198 --> 00:54:53,033
Do you remember stories
about our fathers? The old days?

514
00:54:53,169 --> 00:54:56,468
Yeah, what do you want to Know?

515
00:54:58,074 --> 00:55:04,946
- What was Sonny liKe?
- Well, he was the Prince of the City.

516
00:55:05,081 --> 00:55:08,744
He died before i was born,
but I've heard a lot about him.

517
00:55:10,453 --> 00:55:15,152
- What about my father?
- He's a great man.

518
00:55:15,291 --> 00:55:18,158
He's a hero. He saved the family.

519
00:55:19,829 --> 00:55:21,558
- Vincent?
- What?

520
00:55:21,698 --> 00:55:24,223
Did he Kill his own brother?

521
00:55:28,438 --> 00:55:30,633
No.

522
00:55:32,242 --> 00:55:34,767
So, it's all lies?

523
00:55:38,281 --> 00:55:42,217
Just stories, sweetheart. OKay?

524
00:55:45,522 --> 00:55:47,080
OKay.

525
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:51,253
i believe you.

526
00:55:51,394 --> 00:55:55,296
- I'm glad you're around.
- I'm glad you're here too.

527
00:55:59,769 --> 00:56:02,033
Cugina...

528
00:56:02,172 --> 00:56:04,572
Cous...

529
00:56:18,054 --> 00:56:21,285
I'd liKe to taKe Joey Zasa for a ride
in this and drop him.

530
00:56:21,424 --> 00:56:24,393
Joey Zasa is nothing.

531
00:56:24,527 --> 00:56:28,258
He's a small time enforcer.
He bluffs and threatens.

532
00:56:28,398 --> 00:56:32,459
He's nothing. You can see him coming
a mile away.

533
00:56:33,369 --> 00:56:36,338
- We should Kill him before he...
- No!

534
00:56:39,108 --> 00:56:43,841
Never hate your enemies.
it affects your judgement.

535
00:56:59,495 --> 00:57:02,487
Nice to see you again, Mr Corleone.

536
00:57:22,552 --> 00:57:25,453
Hey, girls. Let's go.

537
00:57:42,739 --> 00:57:47,142
We trusted you to manage
our money in the casinos.

538
00:57:47,277 --> 00:57:53,113
it's not even 20 years. You've sold the
casinos and made fortunes for all of us.

539
00:57:53,249 --> 00:57:56,082
Bravo, Don Corleone!

540
00:57:57,687 --> 00:57:59,712
ThanK you.

541
00:57:59,856 --> 00:58:07,024
Friends, i have come here
because our business together is done.

542
00:58:08,431 --> 00:58:09,898
We have prospered,

543
00:58:10,033 --> 00:58:17,132
and now it is time for us to dissolve
the business relationship between us.

544
00:58:17,273 --> 00:58:19,434
That's it.

545
00:58:19,575 --> 00:58:23,238
But i do have a little surprise. Al?

546
00:58:25,448 --> 00:58:28,212
Your shares in the casinos.

547
00:58:28,351 --> 00:58:33,220
I've cut the red tape, so you could
get your money right away.

548
00:58:38,494 --> 00:58:40,985
50 million dollars!

549
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:44,122
- Not everybody gets the same.
- Nothing for you...

550
00:58:44,267 --> 00:58:50,763
- it depends on your investment.
- Michael, this is really generous!

551
00:58:50,907 --> 00:58:52,204
Wonderful!

552
00:58:55,311 --> 00:59:00,613
- Parisi, how much did you invest?
- i don't remember.

553
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:03,275
You're blessed.

554
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:14,228
My family has done much of
the hard worK, taKen many risKs.

555
00:59:14,364 --> 00:59:17,527
All to maKe money
for the rest of the families.

556
00:59:19,936 --> 00:59:22,769
You all Know Joey Zasa.

557
00:59:22,905 --> 00:59:26,306
He is, i admit, an important man.

558
00:59:26,442 --> 00:59:30,674
His picture is on the cover
of the New YorK Times magazine.

559
00:59:30,813 --> 00:59:35,910
He gets the Esquire Magazine award
for the best dressed gangster.

560
00:59:36,052 --> 00:59:37,883
The newspapers praise him

561
00:59:38,021 --> 00:59:42,617
because he hires BlacKs,
which shows he has a good heart.

562
00:59:44,894 --> 00:59:47,385
He is famous.

563
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:53,696
Who Knows? Maybe one day
he'll maKe all of you popular.

564
00:59:55,304 --> 00:59:56,703
it's true.

565
00:59:56,839 --> 01:00:02,368
i maKe more of a bella figura.
That is my nature.

566
01:00:02,512 --> 01:00:07,472
But i also want to maKe a move
into legitimate enterprises.

567
01:00:07,617 --> 01:00:10,347
I'd liKe a little pin from the Pope.

568
01:00:10,486 --> 01:00:15,890
Sure, i taKe the BlacKs and the Spanish
into my family,

569
01:00:16,025 --> 01:00:19,392
because that's America.

570
01:00:20,163 --> 01:00:24,259
And you guarantee
that they don't deal drugs?

571
01:00:25,234 --> 01:00:30,570
i don't guarantee that. i guarantee
that I'll Kill anybody who does.

572
01:00:34,677 --> 01:00:39,774
- Let me talK to him.
- Who can refuse Don Aitobello?

573
01:00:39,916 --> 01:00:42,976
- Joey, are you...
- No!

574
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:49,786
i say to all of you: i have been
treated this day with no respect.

575
01:00:49,926 --> 01:00:55,330
I've earned you all money. I've made
you rich and i asKed for little.

576
01:00:55,465 --> 01:01:00,528
Good. You will not give, so I'll taKe!

577
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:03,104
As for Don Corleone,

578
01:01:03,239 --> 01:01:10,304
he maKes it very clear to me today
that he is my enemy.

579
01:01:13,282 --> 01:01:16,877
You must choose between us.

580
01:01:19,856 --> 01:01:22,552
No, Joey!

581
01:01:22,692 --> 01:01:25,991
Michael, we could reason together.

582
01:01:26,129 --> 01:01:28,723
No.

583
01:01:28,865 --> 01:01:33,427
Michael, please... let's agree.

584
01:01:33,569 --> 01:01:35,799
He doesn't Know what he's...

585
01:01:35,938 --> 01:01:38,133
No, no.

586
01:01:42,211 --> 01:01:45,180
Michael, the news is everywhere.

587
01:01:46,048 --> 01:01:49,916
Everyone says that you
control lmmobiliare.

588
01:01:50,052 --> 01:01:55,490
lmmobiliare is already laundering
money in Peru and Nassau.

589
01:01:56,526 --> 01:02:01,156
We've worKed with you for 40 years.
We should wet our beaKs a little.

590
01:02:01,297 --> 01:02:06,564
- We want to do business with you.
- That's right, we've been together...

591
01:02:15,912 --> 01:02:19,211
- it's a hit! Let's go!
- Let's get out of here! Move!

592
01:02:38,301 --> 01:02:41,168
My coat! it's my lucky coat!

593
01:02:42,305 --> 01:02:44,136
it's my lucky coat!

594
01:02:50,313 --> 01:02:51,712
Stay behind me!

595
01:03:07,997 --> 01:03:09,726
MiKey, this way!

596
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:21,872
Zasa, you son-of-a-bitch...

597
01:03:42,031 --> 01:03:44,295
Come on. We're out of here.

598
01:04:16,465 --> 01:04:19,298
- You did good, Vincent.
- Grazie.

599
01:04:19,435 --> 01:04:22,666
The old Dons were pretty much
wiped out.

600
01:04:22,805 --> 01:04:25,672
The survivors made deals with Zasa.

601
01:04:27,043 --> 01:04:29,511
- Aitobello?
- He survived.

602
01:04:29,645 --> 01:04:36,312
He's with his daughters in Staten lsland.
He says he's going to retire in Sicily.

603
01:04:36,452 --> 01:04:41,515
Joey Zasa would never pull something
liKe this without the bacKing.

604
01:04:41,657 --> 01:04:47,425
He's just muscle. He doesn't have
the wit for that helicopter attacK.

605
01:04:47,563 --> 01:04:51,897
He doesn't even have the ambition
to wipe out the whole Commission.

606
01:04:52,034 --> 01:04:54,832
i say we hit bacK and taKe Zasa out!

607
01:05:00,409 --> 01:05:03,378
Never let anyone Know
what you're thinKing.

608
01:05:11,454 --> 01:05:15,288
Let's get a message to Joey Zasa.

609
01:05:17,593 --> 01:05:20,960
i respect what he's done.

610
01:05:21,097 --> 01:05:24,328
The new overthrows the old. it's natural.

611
01:05:24,467 --> 01:05:28,096
How can you do business
with this guy?

612
01:05:29,472 --> 01:05:33,568
I'm a businessman, first and foremost.
i want no further conflict.

613
01:05:33,709 --> 01:05:38,942
- Tell him that he can live or he can die.
- Vincent, will you shut up!

614
01:05:56,632 --> 01:05:58,600
That's it.

615
01:06:00,302 --> 01:06:02,270
Joey Zasa...

616
01:06:02,405 --> 01:06:04,737
He can't be doing this alone.

617
01:06:08,577 --> 01:06:13,480
Just when i thought i was out,
they pull me bacK in.

618
01:06:21,323 --> 01:06:27,262
Our true enemy has not yet
shown his face.

619
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:33,325
Michael!

620
01:06:39,542 --> 01:06:44,172
- Has he had his medicine?
- i don't Know what he tooK.

621
01:06:46,081 --> 01:06:50,245
- I've got my wind bacK.
- Call a doctor.

622
01:06:50,386 --> 01:06:53,082
- Run, run, run!
- Vincent!

623
01:06:53,222 --> 01:06:56,385
Run at thunder, girl! Thunder can't hurt!

624
01:06:57,092 --> 01:06:59,720
Harmless noise!

625
01:06:59,862 --> 01:07:05,357
Bullshit! You deceitful old fucK!

626
01:07:05,501 --> 01:07:08,664
Aitobello, you fucK!

627
01:07:10,873 --> 01:07:13,000
Fredo!

628
01:07:13,142 --> 01:07:15,440
Fredo!

629
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:41,427
Oh, God! Dad!

630
01:07:43,339 --> 01:07:45,500
Excuse me.

631
01:07:45,641 --> 01:07:47,632
I'll call Kay.

632
01:07:57,987 --> 01:08:02,356
- Good evening, sir.
- Can we wait here? We'll be bacK soon.

633
01:08:08,430 --> 01:08:14,994
Mr Harrison, you said it was urgent.
Have you come to confess your sins?

634
01:08:15,137 --> 01:08:20,268
Michael Corleone has had a diabetic
stroKe. i wanted you to Know about it.

635
01:08:20,409 --> 01:08:25,278
He's in a coma. I'm here to insist
the deal goes through in any event.

636
01:08:25,414 --> 01:08:27,507
The Pope has not much time left.

637
01:08:29,184 --> 01:08:33,314
So, as you, i am in a difficuit position.

638
01:08:33,455 --> 01:08:37,448
We have to ratify this deal
as soon as possible.

639
01:08:37,593 --> 01:08:41,586
- We have an understanding.
- Good.

640
01:08:41,730 --> 01:08:46,064
- I'm going to the hospital.
- I'll pray for Mr Corleone.

641
01:08:50,139 --> 01:08:54,132
- Our thoughts are with Mr Corleone.
- ThanK you, Father Jim.

642
01:08:56,612 --> 01:09:01,515
Everything would be out in the open
if Corleone dies.

643
01:09:01,650 --> 01:09:03,743
Play for time, Keinszig.

644
01:09:04,486 --> 01:09:09,549
A habit born of a long contemplation
of eternity.

645
01:09:15,831 --> 01:09:19,699
- Forget about it, Vinnie.
- Why? it's a simple hit.

646
01:09:19,835 --> 01:09:26,001
I'd love to smacK Joey Zasa and then
whacK the fag. But it's impossible.

647
01:09:26,141 --> 01:09:31,636
He's always with people, in front of TV
cameras in his own neighbourhood.

648
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:35,272
- it's not impossible. it'll worK for us.
- How?

649
01:09:35,417 --> 01:09:40,445
Do you thinK he's going to let
Uncle Michael survive? Would you?

650
01:09:40,589 --> 01:09:43,717
He may not survive anyway.

651
01:09:43,859 --> 01:09:47,317
- How would you do it?
- I'd do it myseif.

652
01:09:49,264 --> 01:09:51,198
Do it!

653
01:09:53,068 --> 01:09:56,003
- What would you need?
- A couple of guys.

654
01:10:26,402 --> 01:10:28,267
Hello, Michael.

655
01:10:30,806 --> 01:10:32,831
it's Kay.

656
01:10:38,247 --> 01:10:40,215
Kay...

657
01:10:42,051 --> 01:10:44,315
i never expected you.

658
01:10:44,453 --> 01:10:47,581
No, i Know.

659
01:10:49,425 --> 01:10:51,120
But I'm here.

660
01:10:55,197 --> 01:10:58,132
- I'm glad.
- You Know...

661
01:11:00,569 --> 01:11:02,901
I've never seen you looKing so helpless.

662
01:11:07,342 --> 01:11:10,641
it's not so bad, really.

663
01:11:10,779 --> 01:11:16,012
i feel... I'm getting wiser now.

664
01:11:16,151 --> 01:11:19,416
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

665
01:11:19,555 --> 01:11:25,152
- The sicKer you get, the wiser you get?
- When I'm dead, I'll be really smart.

666
01:11:26,795 --> 01:11:31,061
Michael... i want to thanK you for Tony.

667
01:11:34,203 --> 01:11:38,230
He's doing really well.
He's gotten some very good notices,

668
01:11:38,373 --> 01:11:45,745
and he'll maKe his operatic debut
in Sicily, in Palermo this Easter, so...

669
01:11:45,881 --> 01:11:48,509
So, thanK you.

670
01:11:48,650 --> 01:11:52,552
That's a real honour. in Sicily.

671
01:11:56,792 --> 01:12:00,728
i will be there. i won't miss that.

672
01:12:00,863 --> 01:12:02,387
i won't miss that.

673
01:12:08,670 --> 01:12:12,401
Mary, Tony...

674
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:14,873
Go see Dad.

675
01:12:20,282 --> 01:12:23,843
- Sweetheart!
- Everything's going to be all right.

676
01:12:23,986 --> 01:12:27,353
- Tony!
- How are you doing, Pop?

677
01:12:29,224 --> 01:12:32,421
Your mother told me what happened.

678
01:12:32,561 --> 01:12:38,193
- About Palermo? i hope you'll be there.
- Of course. Kiss me.

679
01:12:57,886 --> 01:13:03,950
- Cousin Vinnie?
- He's not here. Cali his apartment.

680
01:13:04,092 --> 01:13:07,459
- it's your cousin Mary.
- Let her in.

681
01:13:11,466 --> 01:13:15,596
Hi, cous. i thought I'd drop by.
ls that oKay?

682
01:13:15,737 --> 01:13:18,365
I'll get the guys.

683
01:13:19,541 --> 01:13:24,137
No, it's not oKay.
You shouldn't have come, Mary.

684
01:13:24,279 --> 01:13:26,406
Only a couple of minutes, oKay?

685
01:13:28,083 --> 01:13:31,541
- You looK beautiful, cous.
- ThanKs.

686
01:13:33,822 --> 01:13:37,258
So this is your club, your hideout?

687
01:13:37,392 --> 01:13:40,486
- Yeah.
- i came here to checK it out.

688
01:13:44,967 --> 01:13:49,028
it's so strange, just me
and Aunt Connie in the house.

689
01:13:49,171 --> 01:13:53,904
- i feel better when I'm with you.
- What's wrong, sweetheart?

690
01:13:54,042 --> 01:13:56,738
- I'm scared about my father.
- Don't be.

691
01:13:56,879 --> 01:14:01,373
When they tooK him out of
the ambulance, i thought he was dead.

692
01:14:01,516 --> 01:14:05,509
Everybody says he's going to be better.

693
01:14:05,654 --> 01:14:07,645
Don't worry.

694
01:14:07,789 --> 01:14:10,587
i remember a shooting when i was little.

695
01:14:11,727 --> 01:14:18,394
And one time Al Neri and other
bodyguards tooK me and Tony away.

696
01:14:18,533 --> 01:14:20,865
ls it all happening again?

697
01:14:22,170 --> 01:14:25,731
Not liKe that, sweetie.

698
01:14:25,874 --> 01:14:31,540
Then why are you hiding here?
ls something going to happen to you?

699
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:36,777
Nothing's going to happen
to me, cugina. We'll taKe care of you.

700
01:14:46,762 --> 01:14:51,324
- Can i stay here and hide out with you?
- Can you help me cooK for the boys?

701
01:14:51,466 --> 01:14:56,665
You Know that i don't Know
how to cooK, but I'll help.

702
01:15:08,216 --> 01:15:10,184
OKay...

703
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:12,446
What do i do?

704
01:15:44,186 --> 01:15:48,247
- i love you, cous.
- i love you, too, cous.

705
01:15:51,026 --> 01:15:53,153
Let us cooK.

706
01:16:09,444 --> 01:16:11,571
Hold me.

707
01:16:47,449 --> 01:16:52,352
You in the press and the police
use words liKe ''Mafia'', ''Cosa Nostra''.

708
01:16:52,487 --> 01:16:58,084
This is a fantasy. We italian-Americans
laid the bricKs that buiit this city.

709
01:16:58,226 --> 01:16:59,853
We have Meucci,
who invented the telephone.

710
01:16:59,995 --> 01:17:03,431
We have Don Ameche,
who played the guy who invented it.

711
01:17:03,565 --> 01:17:09,003
Buy yourseif a raffle ticKet,
maybe you'll win a Cadillac.

712
01:17:10,272 --> 01:17:12,604
The salsiccia is wonderful!

713
01:17:12,741 --> 01:17:14,936
Here, have a sandwich.

714
01:17:27,722 --> 01:17:31,522
- Nice to see you, Mr Zasa.
- Have a nice time.

715
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:36,720
Don't forget to buy your raffle ticKets.

716
01:17:36,865 --> 01:17:41,632
- What are you doing?
- He didn't mean it.

717
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:45,103
- Tell him you're sorry.
- OKay, let's go.

718
01:18:03,458 --> 01:18:06,916
Joey! How are you?

719
01:18:07,062 --> 01:18:09,622
How are you, Buddy boy?

720
01:18:09,764 --> 01:18:13,564
Hey, Joey Zasa! Joey, up your ass!

721
01:18:15,103 --> 01:18:17,594
- Who is this? Do you Know him?
- lgnore him.

722
01:18:17,739 --> 01:18:21,539
Who's going to win the car? The Ant?

723
01:18:23,378 --> 01:18:27,542
This is what gives italian-Americans
a bad name. A cappone liKe this.

724
01:18:27,682 --> 01:18:30,014
Joey, up your ass!

725
01:18:30,152 --> 01:18:33,144
Get off the car!
Do you have a raffle ticKet?

726
01:18:34,289 --> 01:18:37,725
Joey, taKe a looK at my raffle ticKet!

727
01:18:37,859 --> 01:18:41,795
Here's what l thinK of you...
and your raffle ticKet.

728
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:45,593
Get the fucK off this car.
I'll breaK your fucKing balls.

729
01:18:49,070 --> 01:18:50,901
Get out of here!

730
01:19:06,421 --> 01:19:07,888
Run, Joey! You piece of shit!

731
01:19:21,836 --> 01:19:23,565
Open the door!

732
01:19:23,705 --> 01:19:27,766
How are you, Joe?

733
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:30,705
Zasa!

734
01:19:47,562 --> 01:19:54,525
Don't ever again give that Kind of order.
Not while I'm alive.

735
01:19:54,669 --> 01:19:56,728
Understand?

736
01:19:58,006 --> 01:20:04,206
You were too sicK to maKe a decision.
i got a go-ahead from Neri and Connie.

737
01:20:05,146 --> 01:20:07,273
Connie?

738
01:20:16,224 --> 01:20:19,387
it was the right decision, Uncle MiKe.

739
01:20:19,527 --> 01:20:23,327
it was the wrong decision.
i command this family!

740
01:20:23,465 --> 01:20:26,730
Right or wrong...

741
01:20:26,868 --> 01:20:30,099
...it was not what i wanted!

742
01:20:48,256 --> 01:20:50,019
Do you understand?

743
01:20:56,898 --> 01:20:57,990
Yes.

744
01:21:04,806 --> 01:21:06,433
Come on, Michael.

745
01:21:18,153 --> 01:21:19,882
Yes.

746
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:28,687
Good. Vincent, help me to my bed.
i want to talK to you alone for a minute.

747
01:21:35,937 --> 01:21:40,670
You Know, i always feit
responsible for you.

748
01:21:40,809 --> 01:21:43,209
You Know that.

749
01:21:43,345 --> 01:21:45,836
Your father...

750
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:49,507
...my brother, we were opposites.

751
01:21:49,651 --> 01:21:54,588
We would fight and argue.
But i never doubted his love.

752
01:21:54,723 --> 01:21:59,956
He would do anything for me.
But his temper...

753
01:22:03,131 --> 01:22:07,158
Too much. it clouded his reason.

754
01:22:08,503 --> 01:22:11,495
i don't want you to maKe that mistaKe.

755
01:22:13,942 --> 01:22:16,274
Also...

756
01:22:16,411 --> 01:22:20,609
...he, too, had a way with women.

757
01:22:20,749 --> 01:22:23,479
- Vincent...
- So i hear.

758
01:22:23,618 --> 01:22:25,916
What are you doing with my daughter?

759
01:22:28,556 --> 01:22:30,888
What are you doing with her?

760
01:22:35,296 --> 01:22:37,856
it's too dangerous.

761
01:22:40,468 --> 01:22:42,197
Do you hear me?

762
01:22:48,209 --> 01:22:50,143
OKay.

763
01:23:03,725 --> 01:23:05,955
Vincenzo...

764
01:23:09,330 --> 01:23:14,461
When they come,
they'll come at what you love.

765
01:23:21,843 --> 01:23:25,210
Michael, you must lead another life.

766
01:23:25,346 --> 01:23:31,251
You have everything a man could
desire. it's time for you to retire.

767
01:23:31,386 --> 01:23:35,083
i have too much responsibility.

768
01:23:35,223 --> 01:23:41,093
lmmobiliare? it's too difficuit now.
You should really get out.

769
01:23:41,229 --> 01:23:47,429
What do you Know
about those pezzi da novanta in italy?

770
01:23:49,771 --> 01:23:53,571
I'm too old to Know anything
about those new people.

771
01:23:53,708 --> 01:23:58,372
i must accept my age
and grow my olives and tomatoes.

772
01:23:59,681 --> 01:24:04,516
- We're not that old.
- But you're very ill.

773
01:24:04,652 --> 01:24:09,385
Michael... Let me see
what can be done.

774
01:24:09,524 --> 01:24:13,893
Let me worK to maKe your path
a little easier.

775
01:24:14,028 --> 01:24:19,557
- Your friendship does that always.
- That maKes me happy.

776
01:24:19,701 --> 01:24:23,831
Joey Zasa... You were wrong
about him.

777
01:24:25,139 --> 01:24:28,905
i trust too much.
That's always been my fauit.

778
01:24:36,317 --> 01:24:40,344
Michael... treachery is everywhere.

779
01:24:40,488 --> 01:24:45,983
You still have your fingers
on the strings, even now.

780
01:24:46,127 --> 01:24:48,994
Let's see more of each other.

781
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:54,363
- Michael, in Sicily?
- in Sicily.

782
01:24:54,502 --> 01:24:56,367
in Sicilia.

783
01:24:56,504 --> 01:24:59,530
in Sicilia.

784
01:25:46,690 --> 01:25:48,590
How are you?

785
01:25:48,992 --> 01:25:52,621
Don Bendino, my old friend.

786
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:28,689
i brought you here, so that my old friend
and protector, Don Tommasino,

787
01:26:28,832 --> 01:26:30,959
could advise us.

788
01:26:32,736 --> 01:26:36,172
What do you think about Aitobello?

789
01:26:37,207 --> 01:26:39,334
A very talented man.

790
01:26:39,476 --> 01:26:44,243
He has kept the peace between our
Sicilian and American friends.

791
01:26:44,381 --> 01:26:47,350
The saint of reason.

792
01:26:48,952 --> 01:26:53,821
A blood bath in Atlantic City
left New York a mess.

793
01:26:53,957 --> 01:26:56,482
Joey Zasa at least was running
a tight ship,

794
01:26:56,626 --> 01:27:00,187
but with him out of the picture
we must step in.

795
01:27:00,330 --> 01:27:04,892
- Step back in...
- Or the Chinese and Colombians will.

796
01:27:05,035 --> 01:27:10,598
The Corleones left drugs, so New York
is weak, and Palermo is strong.

797
01:27:11,975 --> 01:27:16,241
Your enemies always get strong
on what you leave behind.

798
01:27:18,615 --> 01:27:23,484
Who could give the order
for that massacre...

799
01:27:24,621 --> 01:27:29,058
and still pressure the Vatican deal?

800
01:27:29,192 --> 01:27:34,721
Only Lucchesi can reach
between these two worlds.

801
01:27:36,066 --> 01:27:39,934
''Our ships must all sail
in the same direction''...

802
01:27:41,138 --> 01:27:46,906
italian politics have had these men
for centuries. They are the true Mafia.

803
01:27:47,043 --> 01:27:50,274
The Archbishop and the Vatican Bank,
that's the big problem.

804
01:27:50,413 --> 01:27:54,816
They're the same problem.
B.J., they're connected.

805
01:27:55,552 --> 01:27:57,952
The Archbishop has powerful friends.

806
01:28:00,891 --> 01:28:02,825
They totally protect him.

807
01:28:02,959 --> 01:28:07,259
ls there someone in the
Church we can turn to?

808
01:28:07,397 --> 01:28:10,298
Someone we can tell
our problem to?

809
01:28:12,235 --> 01:28:14,430
Cardinal Lamberto.

810
01:28:14,571 --> 01:28:20,168
A wise and good man...
very influential.

811
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:24,212
He will see you.

812
01:28:28,251 --> 01:28:33,985
i will see this Cardinal Lamberto
and see if we can work things out.

813
01:28:35,892 --> 01:28:40,556
You honour your agreements,
but you are dealing with crooks.

814
01:28:40,697 --> 01:28:43,598
They have no honour.

815
01:28:45,569 --> 01:28:47,230
My word is final.

816
01:28:57,814 --> 01:29:01,716
Politics and crime,
they're the same thing.

817
01:29:24,507 --> 01:29:31,003
I've invited you all here to celebrate
my son's debut in an opera house...

818
01:29:31,147 --> 01:29:34,605
We'll play ''Philadelphia''.

819
01:29:34,751 --> 01:29:38,949
Seven cards. Two down, four up.
Deuces and one-eyed jacks are wild.

820
01:29:39,089 --> 01:29:41,717
...in the opera ''Cavallaria Rusticana''.

821
01:29:41,858 --> 01:29:46,227
- it's ''Cavalleria Rusticana'', Dad.
- ''Cavalleria''.

822
01:29:46,363 --> 01:29:51,801
i think i have tickets to the wrong opera.
I've been in New York too long.

823
01:29:51,935 --> 01:29:55,496
You will all receive tickets,
so come on time.

824
01:29:55,639 --> 01:29:58,403
Dad, I've got a present for you.

825
01:30:01,645 --> 01:30:06,048
it comes from the town of Corleone
and it's authentic Sicilian.

826
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:10,913
And... i learned it for you.

827
01:31:40,010 --> 01:31:46,415
She was wonderful, beautiful.
i loved her. And then she died.

828
01:31:46,549 --> 01:31:53,284
My trusted bodyguard
planted a bomb in my car.

829
01:31:53,423 --> 01:31:55,914
She drove it before i did.

830
01:31:57,127 --> 01:32:00,619
Why is such a beautiful country
so violent?

831
01:32:00,764 --> 01:32:02,356
History.

832
01:32:02,499 --> 01:32:07,027
Mom was telling me about when your
biggest worry was passing your exams.

833
01:32:07,170 --> 01:32:10,833
- Yes, it was then.
- i worry about you now.

834
01:32:10,974 --> 01:32:16,276
Oh, Mary, you're such a
warm-hearted girl. You always were.

835
01:32:16,413 --> 01:32:20,144
- i love my family.
- Even your cousin Vincent?

836
01:32:24,054 --> 01:32:25,954
i really love him.

837
01:32:27,424 --> 01:32:31,588
- He's your first cousin.
- Then i love him first.

838
01:32:31,728 --> 01:32:34,492
Mary, you can't see him.

839
01:32:35,131 --> 01:32:37,964
Just don't see him anymore.

840
01:32:38,101 --> 01:32:41,901
He's right. it's too dangerous.

841
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:47,806
Mary, you can't see him anymore.

842
01:32:47,944 --> 01:32:49,673
- Not in that fashion.
- No.

843
01:32:51,381 --> 01:32:54,782
- Please, promise me.
- No!

844
01:32:54,918 --> 01:32:57,148
- Obey me on this.
- No, Dad!

845
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:07,188
Mary is smart, Dad.
She'll understand eventually.

846
01:33:29,819 --> 01:33:32,811
Bella cugina... Tesoro mio.

847
01:33:44,067 --> 01:33:47,195
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

848
01:33:47,337 --> 01:33:51,467
i want you to do something for me.
it's dangerous.

849
01:33:52,475 --> 01:33:56,309
Good. I'm in. What do you need?

850
01:33:56,446 --> 01:34:00,109
i want you to sell your soul
to Don Aitobello.

851
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:01,911
To betray me.

852
01:34:05,421 --> 01:34:08,356
He'd never believe me.

853
01:34:08,491 --> 01:34:11,460
- That depends.
- Sit down.

854
01:34:13,796 --> 01:34:16,924
i have an idea.

855
01:34:17,066 --> 01:34:21,400
See if you can learn
how high Aitobello is connected.

856
01:34:24,674 --> 01:34:27,165
Arrange a meeting.

857
01:34:29,078 --> 01:34:34,380
You say how devoted you are to me.
Tell him your problems.

858
01:34:34,517 --> 01:34:39,614
- Ask for his help.
- What problems?

859
01:34:39,756 --> 01:34:43,021
That you want to run away
with my daughter.

860
01:34:43,159 --> 01:34:47,687
But you know that if you do,
i will become your enemy.

861
01:34:52,101 --> 01:34:55,593
- You know that i would never do that.
- i know.

862
01:34:56,839 --> 01:35:01,833
Ask Aitobello to speak to me.
To further the marriage.

863
01:35:01,978 --> 01:35:07,917
But you're cousins, after all. Michael
was always a little old-fashioned.

864
01:35:08,051 --> 01:35:13,045
Say you can't belong to my legitimate
world. That you want your own family.

865
01:35:13,723 --> 01:35:18,524
i could straighten out
what Joey Zasa left behind.

866
01:35:18,661 --> 01:35:22,529
i could use your friendship
to persuade him.

867
01:35:22,665 --> 01:35:25,566
i would be indebted to you forever.

868
01:35:27,537 --> 01:35:32,873
A Corleone knows the value
of such a friend.

869
01:35:33,009 --> 01:35:36,069
Then you would work for me?

870
01:35:36,212 --> 01:35:37,873
Si.

871
01:35:40,216 --> 01:35:42,878
Bacio la mano, Don Aitobello.

872
01:35:45,788 --> 01:35:50,725
if he hints that he wants you
to betray me, get insuited,

873
01:35:50,860 --> 01:35:53,852
because that's his trap.

874
01:36:00,403 --> 01:36:03,998
You're not telling me
the whole truth, Vincenzo.

875
01:36:06,776 --> 01:36:13,511
lsn't it true, that with Michael gone,
the girl controls everything?

876
01:36:16,519 --> 01:36:20,319
- Leave the girl out of this.
- Of course, you love her.

877
01:36:20,456 --> 01:36:22,549
And she loves you.

878
01:36:43,012 --> 01:36:47,039
i guessed it, didn't l?

879
01:36:47,183 --> 01:36:53,281
You're a wise man, Don Aitobello.
I'll be learning a lot from you.

880
01:36:53,423 --> 01:36:57,553
The richest man is the one
with the most powerful friends.

881
01:36:59,462 --> 01:37:02,056
it's my duty to make the introductions.

882
01:37:09,072 --> 01:37:11,097
Don Lucchesi.

883
01:37:13,743 --> 01:37:19,613
Don Aitobello tells me that you have
a strong character. A man of respect.

884
01:37:19,749 --> 01:37:23,446
This is the hero who put Joey Zasa
in his grave.

885
01:37:23,586 --> 01:37:27,784
if we'd known of his existence,
we wouldn't have backed Joey.

886
01:37:27,924 --> 01:37:30,358
No one wants another Joe.

887
01:37:31,928 --> 01:37:34,658
Let me be your friend.

888
01:37:34,797 --> 01:37:40,201
- Even the strongest man needs friends.
- I'm flattered.

889
01:37:40,336 --> 01:37:45,035
You're a man of finance and politics.
Things i don't understand.

890
01:37:46,642 --> 01:37:51,011
You understand guns.
Finance is a gun.

891
01:37:51,147 --> 01:37:55,709
Politics is knowing
when to pull the trigger.

892
01:38:00,156 --> 01:38:01,453
How can i help?

893
01:38:02,625 --> 01:38:04,525
Vieni?

894
01:38:06,929 --> 01:38:12,799
Blessed is the peacemaker,
for he can be called the child of God.

895
01:38:12,935 --> 01:38:15,733
- Tu parli italiano un poco?
- Si.

896
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:40,724
The wheelchair, for Don Tommasino.

897
01:38:48,871 --> 01:38:53,433
i trusted this business arrangement
with the Archbishop. i trusted him.

898
01:38:53,576 --> 01:38:57,637
i was sure his honesty
was beyond a doubt.

899
01:38:57,780 --> 01:39:03,047
But, as you see, I'm now
the victim of a swindle.

900
01:39:03,186 --> 01:39:08,715
He's stalling me. Vast monies have
gone to people in high political places

901
01:39:08,858 --> 01:39:11,520
and the Vatican Bank is the guarantor.

902
01:39:11,661 --> 01:39:16,860
if what you say is true,
there will be a great scandal.

903
01:39:19,368 --> 01:39:24,465
Look at this stone. it has been
in the water for a very long time,

904
01:39:24,607 --> 01:39:28,737
but the water has not penetrated it.

905
01:39:32,482 --> 01:39:34,746
Look...

906
01:39:34,884 --> 01:39:40,083
Perfectly dry. The same thing
has happened to men in Europe.

907
01:39:40,223 --> 01:39:44,853
For centuries they have been
surrounded by Christianity,

908
01:39:44,994 --> 01:39:51,991
but Christ has not penetrated.
Christ doesn't live within them.

909
01:39:55,004 --> 01:39:59,065
- What's happening?
- Could you get me something sweet?

910
01:39:59,208 --> 01:40:03,201
Some orange juice, candy...

911
01:40:06,415 --> 01:40:09,543
i have trouble with diabetes.

912
01:40:12,355 --> 01:40:14,823
My blood sugar goes low.

913
01:40:14,957 --> 01:40:17,323
i understand.

914
01:40:39,749 --> 01:40:43,480
it happens sometimes
when I'm under stress.

915
01:40:43,619 --> 01:40:45,849
i understand.

916
01:40:47,123 --> 01:40:51,492
To come to you
on such a delicate matter...

917
01:40:53,930 --> 01:40:59,129
Accusations against your Archbishop.
it was difficuit for me.

918
01:41:00,269 --> 01:41:02,328
The mind suffers

919
01:41:02,471 --> 01:41:06,305
and the body cries out.

920
01:41:11,314 --> 01:41:13,214
That's true.

921
01:41:14,684 --> 01:41:19,053
Would you like to make
your confession?

922
01:41:25,494 --> 01:41:29,225
Your Eminence, I'm...

923
01:41:31,434 --> 01:41:38,237
it's been so long. i wouldn't...
i wouldn't know where to...

924
01:41:38,374 --> 01:41:41,571
it's been 30 years.

925
01:41:41,711 --> 01:41:45,078
I'd use up too much of your time, i think.

926
01:41:45,214 --> 01:41:48,274
i always have time to save souls.

927
01:41:49,819 --> 01:41:54,688
- Well, I'm beyond redemption.
- No, no...

928
01:42:03,933 --> 01:42:08,768
i hear the confessions
of my own priests here.

929
01:42:08,904 --> 01:42:12,806
Sometimes the desire to confess
is overwhelming,

930
01:42:12,942 --> 01:42:16,207
and we must seize the moment.

931
01:42:20,282 --> 01:42:24,844
What is the point of confessing
if i don't repent?

932
01:42:26,489 --> 01:42:29,822
i hear you are a practical man.

933
01:42:29,959 --> 01:42:33,019
What have you got to lose?

934
01:42:43,806 --> 01:42:46,172
Go on.

935
01:42:51,981 --> 01:42:54,415
l...

936
01:42:54,550 --> 01:42:56,814
...betrayed my wife.

937
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:00,247
Go on, my son.

938
01:43:05,327 --> 01:43:07,318
i betrayed myseif.

939
01:43:10,166 --> 01:43:12,396
i killed men.

940
01:43:15,871 --> 01:43:19,705
And i ordered men to be killed.

941
01:43:19,842 --> 01:43:22,174
Go on, my son. Go on.

942
01:43:27,149 --> 01:43:29,208
it's useless.

943
01:43:31,253 --> 01:43:33,244
Go on, my son.

944
01:43:34,256 --> 01:43:36,053
i killed...

945
01:43:40,796 --> 01:43:44,323
i ordered the death of my brother.

946
01:43:44,467 --> 01:43:46,662
He injured me.

947
01:43:47,870 --> 01:43:50,600
i killed my mother's son.

948
01:43:51,807 --> 01:43:54,332
i killed my father's son.

949
01:44:04,587 --> 01:44:10,526
Your sins are terrible,
and it is just that you suffer.

950
01:44:10,659 --> 01:44:14,117
Your life could be redeemed,

951
01:44:14,263 --> 01:44:19,462
but i know that you don't believe that.
You will not change.

952
01:44:48,531 --> 01:44:53,935
Pope Paul Vl, the Supreme Pontiff
of the Roman Catholic Church,...

953
01:44:54,069 --> 01:44:57,903
died last night at 9:40 p.m.

954
01:44:58,040 --> 01:45:01,476
The Pope was 8 1 years old,...

955
01:45:01,610 --> 01:45:06,445
and had been in poor heaith
for the last several months.

956
01:45:10,519 --> 01:45:12,180
Connie...

957
01:45:13,789 --> 01:45:18,692
All my life I've kept trying
to go up in society.

958
01:45:18,828 --> 01:45:22,594
To where everything higher up
was legal, straight...

959
01:45:23,833 --> 01:45:27,701
But the higher i go,
the more crooked it becomes.

960
01:45:30,005 --> 01:45:32,496
Where the hell does it end?

961
01:45:41,317 --> 01:45:45,981
They've been killing each other
for centuries here.

962
01:45:46,121 --> 01:45:50,854
For money, for pride, for family.

963
01:45:53,395 --> 01:45:57,991
To keep from becoming the slaves
of the rich pezzi da novanta.

964
01:46:04,506 --> 01:46:07,600
i made confession, Connie.

965
01:46:07,743 --> 01:46:10,405
i confessed my sins.

966
01:46:11,380 --> 01:46:17,319
Why? That's not like you. You don't
have to confess your sins to a stranger.

967
01:46:17,453 --> 01:46:19,011
it was the man.

968
01:46:20,189 --> 01:46:24,250
He's a good man. A true priest.

969
01:46:27,997 --> 01:46:30,158
He can change things.

970
01:46:32,434 --> 01:46:35,267
Michael...

971
01:46:35,404 --> 01:46:40,103
You know, sometimes i think
of poor Fredo.

972
01:46:40,242 --> 01:46:44,042
Drowned. it was God's will.

973
01:46:46,115 --> 01:46:49,482
it was a terrible accident.

974
01:46:49,618 --> 01:46:51,552
But it's finished.

975
01:46:56,692 --> 01:46:58,887
Michael, i love you.

976
01:47:00,896 --> 01:47:03,490
I'll always help you.

977
01:47:15,344 --> 01:47:17,141
Oh, Connie...

978
01:47:46,709 --> 01:47:54,047
i am honored, Don Aitobello, that
you've come from Palermo to visit me.

979
01:47:56,986 --> 01:48:01,923
Hey, the little kid! He's grown.

980
01:48:02,825 --> 01:48:04,520
Do the donkey for me.

981
01:48:22,011 --> 01:48:27,108
it's been some time since we
did business together.

982
01:48:29,718 --> 01:48:35,054
You are my ''ace in the hole,''
as we say in America.

983
01:48:35,190 --> 01:48:41,857
i have a stone in my shoe.
You can remove it.

984
01:48:48,237 --> 01:48:50,262
Only one stone?

985
01:48:53,242 --> 01:48:58,976
it's dangerous. A famous man.

986
01:48:59,114 --> 01:49:02,413
You will have to take precautions.

987
01:49:05,554 --> 01:49:11,288
Tell me what to do.
Then i will tell you my price.

988
01:49:15,564 --> 01:49:18,158
Ah, what bread!

989
01:49:22,204 --> 01:49:24,638
Olive oil...

990
01:49:29,545 --> 01:49:33,311
Virgin... only in Sicily.

991
01:49:35,751 --> 01:49:37,275
Alla salute!

992
01:49:37,419 --> 01:49:39,387
To death.

993
01:49:53,035 --> 01:49:54,730
Kay!

994
01:49:54,870 --> 01:49:57,236
- Connie!
- How are you?

995
01:49:57,372 --> 01:50:00,773
Mary, I've missed you.

996
01:50:00,909 --> 01:50:04,777
- Hello, Michael.
- Mom, look at this.

997
01:50:08,584 --> 01:50:14,545
- it's too bad Douglas couldn't come.
- i know. He had a very important trial.

998
01:50:14,690 --> 01:50:17,784
i know he wanted to come.

999
01:50:17,926 --> 01:50:20,224
- The car is...
- Okay.

1000
01:50:21,930 --> 01:50:28,096
- Well, your son is an artist.
- Oh, yes. Thanks to you.

1001
01:50:28,237 --> 01:50:33,072
- What for?
- For making me let him go.

1002
01:50:33,208 --> 01:50:38,840
Well, after all these years,
here i am in Sicily for the first time.

1003
01:50:38,981 --> 01:50:42,144
- i want to get a picture of you together.
- Okay.

1004
01:50:44,086 --> 01:50:46,020
Hey, Dad. Smile!

1005
01:50:50,392 --> 01:50:54,385
i see you still have Al Neri. Why?

1006
01:50:54,530 --> 01:50:59,160
i need him. He helps me
get in and out of the car.

1007
01:50:59,301 --> 01:51:04,170
- He carries my briefcase.
- You're still a liar, Michael.

1008
01:51:04,306 --> 01:51:10,472
Let me show you Sicily, the real Sicily.
So you'll understand the family history.

1009
01:51:10,612 --> 01:51:14,013
i think i understand it more than enough.

1010
01:52:05,133 --> 01:52:11,800
Anthony, i have something you made
for me a very long time ago.

1011
01:52:12,841 --> 01:52:15,935
- Might bring you luck.
- Thanks.

1012
01:52:19,681 --> 01:52:23,811
You saved it... i remember.

1013
01:52:27,089 --> 01:52:29,023
Thank you, Dad.

1014
01:52:30,459 --> 01:52:31,949
I'm proud of you.

1015
01:52:32,794 --> 01:52:34,591
Thank you.

1016
01:52:50,445 --> 01:52:53,278
- Are they as good as they look?
- Better.

1017
01:52:53,415 --> 01:52:58,250
They're the best. As long as they are
around, Uncle Michael is safe.

1018
01:52:58,387 --> 01:53:00,582
Goodbye.

1019
01:53:02,891 --> 01:53:06,258
- Tell your father I'll be back for dinner.
- Okay.

1020
01:53:06,395 --> 01:53:09,091
- Have fun.
- Tell Tony to wait for me.

1021
01:53:09,231 --> 01:53:10,960
i will.

1022
01:53:13,068 --> 01:53:16,663
Buongiorno, signora. At your service.

1023
01:53:20,375 --> 01:53:23,503
if i see Dad, I'll tell him you left.

1024
01:53:27,849 --> 01:53:31,148
You're the only one left
with my father's strength.

1025
01:53:34,923 --> 01:53:39,223
if anything happens to Michael,
i want you to strike back.

1026
01:53:41,163 --> 01:53:42,721
I'll have everything ready.

1027
01:53:45,901 --> 01:53:49,393
Do you swear?

1028
01:53:56,478 --> 01:53:58,503
i swear to you.

1029
01:54:28,577 --> 01:54:31,808
Here it is.

1030
01:54:31,947 --> 01:54:35,474
The house where my father was born.

1031
01:54:35,617 --> 01:54:41,214
This is where they came to take him
when he was a boy. To kill him.

1032
01:54:43,225 --> 01:54:45,352
Wait...

1033
01:54:45,494 --> 01:54:47,394
Listen to that.

1034
01:55:07,849 --> 01:55:11,285
You know Mary's in love.

1035
01:55:11,420 --> 01:55:14,116
Yes, i know.

1036
01:55:14,256 --> 01:55:19,353
With a handsome young italian man
with dark eyes...

1037
01:55:19,494 --> 01:55:21,325
i won't allow it.

1038
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:27,968
it's wrong. it's wrong and it's dangerous.

1039
01:55:28,103 --> 01:55:31,470
''Oh father, my father!''

1040
01:55:31,606 --> 01:55:34,131
''Give me some time to pray
to the Lord.''

1041
01:55:34,876 --> 01:55:39,142
The Baroness of Carini had
betrayed her husband...

1042
01:55:39,281 --> 01:55:41,715
and fallen in love with her cousin.

1043
01:55:41,850 --> 01:55:43,283
''There will be no forgiveness!''

1044
01:55:43,418 --> 01:55:48,355
Her father stabbed her through
the heart.

1045
01:56:00,168 --> 01:56:02,932
Honour, huh?

1046
01:56:21,323 --> 01:56:24,349
i remember the time you came
to my parents' house

1047
01:56:24,493 --> 01:56:27,792
and told me about the family business.

1048
01:56:27,929 --> 01:56:34,061
How you'd never have anything
to do with it. You sounded like Tony.

1049
01:56:34,202 --> 01:56:36,193
i was a lot like Tony.

1050
01:56:43,812 --> 01:56:46,838
- i can barely see him... Kay?
- What?

1051
01:56:46,982 --> 01:56:49,246
- Do you mind driving?
- What's wrong?

1052
01:56:49,384 --> 01:56:54,083
My eyes. Sometimes
they're all right, but...

1053
01:56:54,222 --> 01:56:56,884
i have to see Don Tommasino...

1054
01:57:00,262 --> 01:57:02,628
Well...

1055
01:57:02,764 --> 01:57:06,256
- There are no bodyguards today.
- i really snuck away.

1056
01:57:13,508 --> 01:57:17,877
Father, where are you going?
Would you like a ride?

1057
01:57:27,422 --> 01:57:32,325
i know you. You're Mosca
of Montelepre.

1058
01:57:32,460 --> 01:57:36,294
You were an assassin then,
and you're an assassin now.

1059
01:57:36,431 --> 01:57:39,832
i know Michael Corleone
is at your house.

1060
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:42,163
i will pass through the gates
with you.

1061
01:57:54,883 --> 01:57:57,647
How are you?

1062
01:58:01,022 --> 01:58:05,584
This is Calo, one of my bodyguards
in the old days.

1063
01:58:10,265 --> 01:58:13,496
- We can wait here.
- You want a drink?

1064
01:58:18,473 --> 01:58:22,375
i spent a lot of time in this room...

1065
01:58:22,510 --> 01:58:24,535
...thinking of you.

1066
01:58:27,582 --> 01:58:30,210
And then you got married.

1067
01:58:33,388 --> 01:58:38,655
- i still thought of you.
- What's in that room?

1068
01:58:41,463 --> 01:58:45,524
This is dangerous for you. This is Sicily.

1069
01:58:48,136 --> 01:58:52,971
- i love this country.
- Why?

1070
01:58:53,108 --> 01:58:59,047
Well, all through history, terrible things
have happened to these people.

1071
01:58:59,981 --> 01:59:02,950
Terrible injustices.

1072
01:59:03,084 --> 01:59:07,578
But they still expect good,
rather than bad, will happen to them.

1073
01:59:07,722 --> 01:59:10,919
Sort of like me and you?

1074
01:59:13,161 --> 01:59:18,098
- How so?
- I'm still here, right?

1075
01:59:18,233 --> 01:59:21,430
We do have a bad history,
but I'm still here.

1076
01:59:21,569 --> 01:59:24,163
Yes, you are, but with dread.

1077
01:59:29,110 --> 01:59:30,873
Give me the order!

1078
01:59:31,012 --> 01:59:35,506
ls that supposed to make me
not dread you?

1079
01:59:36,851 --> 01:59:39,615
We're in Sicily. it's opera.

1080
01:59:41,723 --> 01:59:43,714
Okay.

1081
01:59:45,527 --> 01:59:47,825
What do we do now?

1082
01:59:50,231 --> 01:59:54,725
Be reasonable.
Let's try not to hurt each other.

1083
02:00:01,476 --> 02:00:03,501
i want you to forgive me.

1084
02:00:06,047 --> 02:00:08,982
- For what?
- Everything.

1085
02:00:13,354 --> 02:00:16,346
Oh, like God?

1086
02:00:17,192 --> 02:00:20,093
No, i need something a little closer.

1087
02:00:22,897 --> 02:00:27,561
You couldn't understand,
back in those days.

1088
02:00:27,702 --> 02:00:32,503
i loved my father. i swore i would
never be a man like him,

1089
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:36,974
but i loved him and he was in danger.
What could i do?

1090
02:00:37,112 --> 02:00:40,604
And then later, you were in danger.

1091
02:00:40,749 --> 02:00:44,981
Our children were in danger.
What could i do?

1092
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:52,151
You were all that l... loved and valued
most in the world.

1093
02:00:52,293 --> 02:00:54,853
Now I'm losing you. i lost you.

1094
02:00:55,997 --> 02:00:59,023
You're gone.

1095
02:00:59,167 --> 02:01:02,830
And it was all for nothing. So...

1096
02:01:06,574 --> 02:01:11,841
You have to understand,
i had a whole different destiny planned.

1097
02:01:15,316 --> 02:01:17,614
All right, I'll stop.

1098
02:01:27,629 --> 02:01:31,565
i really don't know what you
want from me, Michael.

1099
02:01:31,699 --> 02:01:36,762
- i mean...
- I'm not the man that you think i am.

1100
02:01:38,006 --> 02:01:42,204
- i don't know.
- i love you, Kay.

1101
02:01:43,344 --> 02:01:46,336
Don't dread me anymore.

1102
02:01:51,152 --> 02:01:55,589
You know, every night here in Sicily...

1103
02:01:57,125 --> 02:02:02,893
...i dream about my wife
and my children...

1104
02:02:05,834 --> 02:02:08,325
...and how i lost them.

1105
02:02:10,004 --> 02:02:15,738
i guess that if it's any consolation,
i want you to know that...

1106
02:02:19,113 --> 02:02:21,445
...that...

1107
02:02:21,583 --> 02:02:25,349
...i always loved you, Michael.

1108
02:02:25,486 --> 02:02:28,819
And you know...

1109
02:02:28,957 --> 02:02:32,552
...always, i always will.

1110
02:02:59,587 --> 02:03:02,351
What is it? What's wrong?

1111
02:03:02,490 --> 02:03:05,618
They found Don Tommasino shot.

1112
02:03:06,861 --> 02:03:08,624
ls he dead?

1113
02:03:10,632 --> 02:03:14,363
My master is dead.
Blood calls for blood.

1114
02:03:14,502 --> 02:03:18,131
i must have revenge!

1115
02:03:21,109 --> 02:03:26,979
Some day, you may have to do
a difficuit service for me.

1116
02:03:27,115 --> 02:03:28,548
Command me.

1117
02:03:29,751 --> 02:03:31,548
it never ends.

1118
02:03:31,686 --> 02:03:33,984
i will avenge him!

1119
02:03:48,870 --> 02:03:50,531
Totals...

1120
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:55,671
Lorscheider, 1 vote.

1121
02:03:55,810 --> 02:03:58,643
Siri, 1 1 votes.

1122
02:03:59,447 --> 02:04:02,382
Lamberto, 99 votes.

1123
02:04:08,122 --> 02:04:13,822
Do you accept your election
as supreme pontiff?

1124
02:04:13,962 --> 02:04:20,561
Oh God, shed light on the decision
they have taken on my behaif.

1125
02:04:20,702 --> 02:04:22,533
i accept.

1126
02:04:22,670 --> 02:04:25,036
By what name do you
wish to be called?

1127
02:04:25,173 --> 02:04:28,301
John Paul the First.

1128
02:04:57,772 --> 02:05:02,732
i will do things ''right away,''
rather than in ''a little while''...

1129
02:05:04,712 --> 02:05:10,116
Frederick Keinszig, known as ''God's
Banker'', has been reported missing.

1130
02:05:10,251 --> 02:05:17,487
He was last seen leaving the Rome
offices of Vatican owned lmmobiliare.

1131
02:05:17,625 --> 02:05:21,686
Also missing was a large sum
of money and several documents.

1132
02:05:21,829 --> 02:05:25,128
Keinszig, you fool.

1133
02:05:28,136 --> 02:05:33,233
His absence casts further suspicion
on the dealings of the Vatican Bank.

1134
02:05:33,374 --> 02:05:36,070
For several years,
the bank and its companies

1135
02:05:36,210 --> 02:05:40,772
have been the object of allegations
of disreputable business practices.

1136
02:05:40,915 --> 02:05:47,115
Lucchesi, will you please
try to understand?

1137
02:05:47,255 --> 02:05:51,521
i have phoned him.
i have waited here by the phone.

1138
02:05:54,195 --> 02:05:58,757
You would do well to remember,
Mr Lucchesi,

1139
02:05:58,900 --> 02:06:05,931
that this Pope has very different ideas
from the last one.

1140
02:06:27,495 --> 02:06:29,986
Goodbye, my old friend.

1141
02:06:32,100 --> 02:06:35,536
You could have lived a little longer.

1142
02:06:35,670 --> 02:06:38,639
i could be closer to my dream.

1143
02:06:44,378 --> 02:06:47,404
You were so loved, Don Tommasino.

1144
02:06:51,953 --> 02:06:56,822
Why was i so feared,
and you so loved?

1145
02:06:56,958 --> 02:06:59,552
What was it?

1146
02:06:59,694 --> 02:07:03,721
i was no less honourable.

1147
02:07:03,865 --> 02:07:06,959
i wanted to do good.

1148
02:07:10,004 --> 02:07:13,303
What betrayed me?
My mind? My heart?

1149
02:07:15,877 --> 02:07:18,812
Why do i condemn myseif so?

1150
02:07:24,952 --> 02:07:27,113
i swear,

1151
02:07:27,255 --> 02:07:29,985
on the lives of my children...

1152
02:07:33,928 --> 02:07:37,420
Give me a chance to redeem myseif...

1153
02:07:40,668 --> 02:07:44,968
...and i will sin no more.

1154
02:08:07,862 --> 02:08:14,290
You look pale. Bad news?
Tell me right away.

1155
02:08:14,435 --> 02:08:17,962
it's not just a bad banking deal.

1156
02:08:18,105 --> 02:08:21,131
These guys are butchers.

1157
02:08:21,275 --> 02:08:25,678
- What guys?
- Lucchesi.

1158
02:08:25,813 --> 02:08:31,308
He controls all of them:
Aitobello, the Archbishop...

1159
02:08:31,452 --> 02:08:34,012
...others higher up, P2 maybe.

1160
02:08:34,155 --> 02:08:38,114
Secret unknown.
They're running things.

1161
02:08:41,028 --> 02:08:46,364
- I'm in their way.
- He's hired an assassin to kill you.

1162
02:08:46,500 --> 02:08:51,028
A Sicilian. i don't know his name.

1163
02:08:51,172 --> 02:08:54,539
But they say he never fails.

1164
02:08:54,675 --> 02:08:56,802
Then no one is safe.

1165
02:08:59,580 --> 02:09:02,981
Even the new Pope is in danger.

1166
02:09:03,117 --> 02:09:07,383
We still have time. We can prevent this.

1167
02:09:11,525 --> 02:09:14,392
i tried, Vincent.

1168
02:09:16,030 --> 02:09:18,931
i tried...

1169
02:09:19,066 --> 02:09:24,766
...to keep everything from coming
to this. But it's not possible.

1170
02:09:24,905 --> 02:09:27,237
Not in this world.

1171
02:09:28,276 --> 02:09:30,267
Give me the order.

1172
02:09:33,781 --> 02:09:36,909
You won't be able to go back.

1173
02:09:37,051 --> 02:09:40,179
- You'll be like me.
- Good.

1174
02:09:40,888 --> 02:09:43,686
All my life i wanted out.

1175
02:09:43,824 --> 02:09:46,088
i wanted the family out.

1176
02:09:47,928 --> 02:09:49,759
i don't want out.

1177
02:09:49,897 --> 02:09:53,060
i want the power to preserve the family.

1178
02:09:57,738 --> 02:10:00,206
I'm asking for the order.

1179
02:10:20,695 --> 02:10:23,425
it's done.

1180
02:10:23,564 --> 02:10:26,294
Because i can't do it anymore.

1181
02:10:29,003 --> 02:10:34,373
Well, it doesn't matter.
Vincent knows what to do.

1182
02:10:34,508 --> 02:10:39,502
Come on outside.
Take a rest and don't think about it.

1183
02:10:39,647 --> 02:10:43,708
- All i do is think about it.
- I'm your son.

1184
02:10:43,851 --> 02:10:46,319
Command me in all things.

1185
02:10:48,289 --> 02:10:50,621
Give up my daughter.

1186
02:10:53,194 --> 02:10:56,322
That's the price you pay...

1187
02:10:56,464 --> 02:10:59,194
...for the life you choose.

1188
02:11:24,892 --> 02:11:26,689
Nephew...

1189
02:11:28,729 --> 02:11:32,392
...from this moment on...

1190
02:11:32,533 --> 02:11:35,559
...call yourseif Vincent Corleone.

1191
02:11:39,640 --> 02:11:41,471
Sit.

1192
02:11:56,190 --> 02:11:58,988
Don Vincenzo...

1193
02:12:03,864 --> 02:12:05,661
Don Corleone...

1194
02:12:08,936 --> 02:12:11,496
Don Vincenzo Corleone...

1195
02:13:44,865 --> 02:13:47,163
E tu, Vincenzo...

1196
02:13:47,301 --> 02:13:52,204
i know how you feel about Michael,
but you can't save him.

1197
02:13:52,339 --> 02:13:55,706
He's lost.

1198
02:13:55,843 --> 02:13:57,401
Think of yourseif.

1199
02:13:58,712 --> 02:14:03,081
What's your answer, Vincent?

1200
02:14:03,217 --> 02:14:05,481
Enjoy the opera.

1201
02:14:07,121 --> 02:14:09,316
it's all taken care of.

1202
02:14:14,395 --> 02:14:17,193
Check the bar. I'll check the top floor.

1203
02:14:20,935 --> 02:14:25,395
''Here's hoping Tony sings better at the
Teatro Massimo than in the shower.''

1204
02:14:25,539 --> 02:14:27,564
''Love, Douglas.''

1205
02:14:27,708 --> 02:14:32,145
- My darling Constanza!
- Don Aitobello.

1206
02:14:32,279 --> 02:14:36,079
- This is a great occasion.
- Come, sit down.

1207
02:14:39,920 --> 02:14:44,448
Happy birthday.
You're 80, but don't look more than 60.

1208
02:14:44,592 --> 02:14:46,321
You're the only one who remembered.

1209
02:14:46,460 --> 02:14:52,126
We've just got the word. The Pope has
ratified the lmmobiliare deal. We've won.

1210
02:14:52,266 --> 02:14:54,257
Congratulations.

1211
02:14:56,770 --> 02:14:59,102
Strange how things work.

1212
02:14:59,239 --> 02:15:03,972
The Pope is doing what you said
he'd do. He's cleaning house.

1213
02:15:04,111 --> 02:15:08,810
He should be careful.
it's dangerous to be an honest man.

1214
02:15:14,288 --> 02:15:17,587
i want to put more muscle backstage
with Tony.

1215
02:15:29,403 --> 02:15:32,861
On your birthday you used to
shower me with treats.

1216
02:15:33,007 --> 02:15:35,635
Tootsie Rolls!

1217
02:15:35,776 --> 02:15:41,544
The nuns who made this cannoli took a
vow of silence. They're the very finest.

1218
02:15:44,752 --> 02:15:49,553
- Hey.
- Hey, cous.

1219
02:15:49,690 --> 02:15:52,784
Hi. Where's your leather?

1220
02:15:56,463 --> 02:15:57,987
Stop it.

1221
02:16:04,004 --> 02:16:08,304
You're so thin. You eat it.

1222
02:16:23,957 --> 02:16:25,288
E buono.

1223
02:16:25,426 --> 02:16:28,793
Grazie!

1224
02:16:31,065 --> 02:16:35,297
it's over. There are things i have to do
that you can't be part of.

1225
02:16:35,436 --> 02:16:38,530
it's not your father's decision, it's mine.

1226
02:16:40,240 --> 02:16:42,708
Don't hate your father.

1227
02:16:44,445 --> 02:16:48,279
There are things I'll be part of
that you can't be around.

1228
02:16:50,250 --> 02:16:53,686
After tonight,
you won't see me anymore.

1229
02:16:57,424 --> 02:17:01,884
You've got to understand, Mary.
You've got to understand.

1230
02:17:02,029 --> 02:17:04,930
I'll always love you.

1231
02:17:16,910 --> 02:17:18,343
Love somebody else.

1232
02:20:59,800 --> 02:21:03,896
- They won't try anything.
- Everything's fine. it's all clear.

1233
02:21:04,037 --> 02:21:07,131
I've already sent Al Neri to the Vatican.

1234
02:21:19,019 --> 02:21:21,579
Mr. Lucchesi's house?

1235
02:21:23,457 --> 02:21:27,757
i bring a message from
Michael Corleone.

1236
02:21:29,062 --> 02:21:30,962
Let him in.

1237
02:22:59,519 --> 02:23:01,419
Buona sera.

1238
02:26:22,389 --> 02:26:25,017
Good. You got him.

1239
02:27:16,576 --> 02:27:20,273
Tonight the Corleone family
settles its accounts.

1240
02:27:20,413 --> 02:27:26,249
Keinszig...
That little Swiss banker fuck.

1241
02:27:26,386 --> 02:27:30,846
He's been swindling everyone
from the beginning. Fuck him.

1242
02:27:31,758 --> 02:27:34,352
Don Lucchesi, my friend.

1243
02:27:34,494 --> 02:27:37,554
Calo will pay him a visit at his home.

1244
02:27:39,833 --> 02:27:44,634
Neri, take a train to Rome.

1245
02:27:44,771 --> 02:27:46,705
Light a candle for the Archbishop.

1246
02:28:23,076 --> 02:28:26,671
Tea, Your Holiness? it will help
you sleep.

1247
02:28:48,935 --> 02:28:51,563
This is from Vincent Corleone.

1248
02:29:50,129 --> 02:29:55,032
it's serious. Our man inside the Vatican
says there's a plot against the Pope.

1249
02:29:55,168 --> 02:29:57,329
He'll have a heart attack?

1250
02:30:04,644 --> 02:30:10,105
This Pope has powerful enemies.
We may not be in time to save him.

1251
02:30:12,652 --> 02:30:14,142
Let's go back.

1252
02:30:49,022 --> 02:30:50,683
Eminenza...

1253
02:31:06,573 --> 02:31:08,973
The Holy Father is dead!

1254
02:32:39,165 --> 02:32:41,326
Sleep.

1255
02:32:41,467 --> 02:32:43,697
Sleep, Godfather.

1256
02:33:53,506 --> 02:33:55,701
Speak...tell me.

1257
02:33:57,310 --> 02:34:03,715
You have lost the
faith of the people.

1258
02:34:05,118 --> 02:34:09,316
He who builds on the people
builds on mud.

1259
02:34:09,455 --> 02:34:13,482
And Michael Corleone's message?

1260
02:34:30,643 --> 02:34:36,775
it's very important.
i must whisper it in your ear.

1261
02:34:40,653 --> 02:34:42,644
He's clean.

1262
02:35:00,807 --> 02:35:03,640
Power wears out those
who don't have it.

1263
02:36:32,331 --> 02:36:35,528
- i like this outfit.
- i figured you would.

1264
02:36:35,668 --> 02:36:37,363
Say hello.

1265
02:36:59,458 --> 02:37:03,224
- Can i talk to you now?
- No, it's not a good time.

1266
02:37:03,362 --> 02:37:07,321
- You're just like my father.
- Stay with the family. Go on.

1267
02:37:08,834 --> 02:37:10,597
- Talk to me.
- The twins are dead.

1268
02:37:10,736 --> 02:37:15,036
in about one minute, there will be
carabinieri all over this place.

1269
02:37:15,174 --> 02:37:17,472
Get everybody to the cars, quietly.

1270
02:37:17,610 --> 02:37:19,601
- Got it.
- Quiet.

1271
02:37:34,527 --> 02:37:37,087
The name Corleone
will be associated with a voice.

1272
02:37:47,974 --> 02:37:49,839
Dad...

1273
02:38:09,095 --> 02:38:12,690
Dad... Why are you doing this to me?

1274
02:38:22,108 --> 02:38:25,168
Move back, move back.

1275
02:38:25,311 --> 02:38:31,181
- You don't have to do this to me.
- Do what? What do you mean?

1276
02:38:55,908 --> 02:38:57,773
Dad...

1277
02:39:14,894 --> 02:39:17,328
No! Mary!

1278
02:39:18,064 --> 02:39:22,000
God, no!
