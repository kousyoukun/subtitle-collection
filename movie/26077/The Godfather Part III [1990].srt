(MICHAEL) My dear children,

2
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:50,863
it is now better than several years
since I moved to New York

3
00:01:51,033 --> 00:01:54,946
and I haven't seen you
as much as I would like to.

4
00:01:55,433 --> 00:01:59,062
I hope you will come to this ceremony
of Papal honours,

5
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:01,542
given for my charitable work.

6
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,865
The only wealth in this world is children.

7
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:10,025
More than all the money
and power on Earth.

8
00:02:10,753 --> 00:02:13,108
You are my treasure.

9
00:02:14,513 --> 00:02:16,743
Anthony and Mary,

10
00:02:16,913 --> 00:02:21,464
although I entrusted your education to
your mother for your own best interest,

11
00:02:21,633 --> 00:02:27,583
I look forward to seeing you, and to
a new period of harmony in our lives.

12
00:02:28,673 --> 00:02:33,269
Perhaps you might prevail upon your
mother to come to this celebration,

13
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:38,553
and that from time to time, we can all
see each other at family functions.

14
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:44,029
Anyway, I remain your loving father.

Almighty God, bless the insignia
of Saint Sebastian the Martyr,

31
00:03:59,553 --> 00:04:05,583
that it may contribute to the sacredness
of him to whom it is given.

Do you, Michael, promise to be faithful
to the noble purposes of this Order,

33
00:04:24,713 --> 00:04:29,104
to have a special care for the poor,
the needy and those who are ill?

34

I do so promise.

- Problem?
- My name isn't on the list.

46
00:06:41,713 --> 00:06:46,343
- Then you have to leave immediately.
- You want to dance with me?

Joe, it's Vinnie. These are our guests.

- Sit down.
- My son, Anthony.

56

The Order of Saint Sebastian is one of
the highest honours the Church awards.

57
00:07:56,993 --> 00:07:59,029
It was first granted by Pope...

58
00:07:59,193 --> 00:08:02,503
What about Mr Corleone's connections
with gambling?

59
00:08:02,913 --> 00:08:04,744
The press kits have...

60
00:08:04,913 --> 00:08:08,508
- And involvement with the underworld?
- Cut the crap.

61
00:08:08,793 --> 00:08:11,671
The Pope, the Holy Father himself,

62
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:16,349
has today blessed Michael Corleone.
Do you know better than the Pope?

63
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:20,105
Vincent! She loves you.

64
00:08:20,273 --> 00:08:22,025
Yeah?

65
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:27,032
I love you too.

66
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:36,109
Hi, Vincent. I remember you.

67
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:41,426
- From where?
- The last party we were at together.

68
00:08:41,593 --> 00:08:45,711
- Did you come to the club?
- No, it was a wedding.

69
00:08:46,713 --> 00:08:49,785
I was eight and you were 15.

70
00:08:50,153 --> 00:08:52,986
I had many girlfriends when I was 15.

71
00:08:53,153 --> 00:08:55,303
- Eight-year-olds?
- Especially them.

72
00:08:57,273 --> 00:08:59,468
Where's Mary?

73
00:08:59,633 --> 00:09:04,024
Would somebody please hail Mary?
Excuse me, Your Excellency.

74
00:09:04,393 --> 00:09:08,511
You haven't kissed me hello yet.
Relatives always kiss.

75
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:12,188
- Now we're related?
- I'm your little cousin.

76
00:09:19,273 --> 00:09:22,583
- Who's your father?
- I'll give you a hint.

77
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:25,271
He's Italian.

78
00:09:26,553 --> 00:09:28,908
Mary, we've been waiting for you.

79
00:09:29,073 --> 00:09:32,622
Remember to keep your voice low.

My daughter, Mary Corleone.

83
00:10:10,473 --> 00:10:12,270
Thanks.

84
00:10:12,953 --> 00:10:18,152
I think I inherited my father's love
for speechmaking. Here it goes.

The Vito Corleone Foundation helps

to the resurrection of Sicily.

Archbishop Gilday,

89
00:10:35,313 --> 00:10:41,502
here is 100 million dollars for the poor
of Sicily, in the name of Vito Corleone.

90
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:44,706
Don't spend it all in one place.

91
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:06,712
Mary, I'm so proud of you.

92

Michael...

93
00:11:14,993 --> 00:11:18,269
You've done a wonderful thing for Sicily.

94
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:22,221
Let's hope that the money gets
to the people who need it.

97
00:11:36,633 --> 00:11:39,591
Thank you very much.
I'm happy to be here.

98
00:11:39,753 --> 00:11:44,873
I would like you to join me in honouring
Commendatore Michael Corleone.

99
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:52,384
I have something special
for our godfather.

100
00:11:52,553 --> 00:11:56,865
I happen to know his favourite song.
Michael, where are you going?

101
00:11:57,033 --> 00:12:01,026
I'm off to the kitchen
to hear some Tony Bennett records.

102
00:12:01,713 --> 00:12:04,352
Your favourite song: "Salsiccia's Own".

103
00:12:04,513 --> 00:12:07,949
I'm having a salsiccia sandwich.
I'll be back.

104
00:12:12,313 --> 00:12:17,307
# A rose must remain
With the sun and the rain

won't come true

Hello, Kay.

109
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,905
Congratulations, Michael.
That's quite an honour.

110
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:58,065
But a little expensive, wouldn't you say?

111
00:13:00,273 --> 00:13:03,310
- Cake?
- No, thank you.

112
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:10,306
(HE SINGS IN ITALIAN)

113
00:13:16,673 --> 00:13:19,506
- It's been a long time, hasn't it?
- Yeah.

114
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,107
- Eight years.
- Yeah.

115
00:13:22,273 --> 00:13:24,548
You look wonderful.

116
00:13:27,513 --> 00:13:32,303
Your son has something he wants to
talk to you about. I came here for him.

117
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:47,063
# If a flame has to grow
There must be a glow

118
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:51,465
# To open each door there's a key

119
00:13:52,553 --> 00:13:56,387
# I need you, I know
I can't let you go... #

120
00:14:05,233 --> 00:14:10,990
- What's wrong with being a lawyer?
- He wants his life to be in music.

121
00:14:12,273 --> 00:14:16,585
Music is great, I love music.
But he should finish what he started.

122
00:14:16,753 --> 00:14:18,232
Anthony...

123
00:14:18,393 --> 00:14:21,465
- I'm going my own way.
- Your own way?

124
00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:23,191
- Professional singer?
- Right.

125
00:14:23,353 --> 00:14:26,584
What happens if you fail?

126
00:14:26,753 --> 00:14:30,712
- I won't fail.
- Men always believe that.

127
00:14:30,873 --> 00:14:34,661
A law degree
is like taking out insurance.

128
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,951
- After that you can work for me...
- I will never work for you.

129
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:42,352
I have bad memories.

130
00:14:43,033 --> 00:14:45,672
Every family has bad memories.

131
00:14:49,073 --> 00:14:53,225
I'll always be your son, but won't have
anything to do with your business.

132
00:14:55,753 --> 00:14:59,632
Anthony... finish the law degree.

133
00:15:00,793 --> 00:15:02,306
No.

134
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:22,426
Well, that he got from you. That "no".

135
00:15:25,153 --> 00:15:30,432
- You could've helped me convince him.
- Convince him of what?

136
00:15:30,593 --> 00:15:32,629
Of what?

137
00:15:32,793 --> 00:15:37,503
He throws his life away.
He throws greatness away.

138
00:15:38,273 --> 00:15:40,582
This is greatness?

139
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:45,510
Now that you're so respectable,
you're more dangerous than ever.

140
00:15:45,673 --> 00:15:49,985
I preferred you when you were
just a common Mafia hood.

141
00:15:50,793 --> 00:15:52,465
OK.

142
00:15:53,073 --> 00:15:56,543
- Can we talk common sense here?
- All right.

143
00:16:03,033 --> 00:16:05,945
Tony knows that you killed Fredo.

144
00:16:11,873 --> 00:16:14,990
- What did you come here for?
- To protect my son.

145
00:16:15,153 --> 00:16:20,181
Not to see you disguised by your
church. That was a shameful ceremony.

146
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,952
I spent my life protecting my son.

147
00:16:27,113 --> 00:16:30,662
I spent my life protecting my family!

148
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,506
Let's be reasonable, OK?

149
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:38,549
That's your big thing,
isn't it, Michael? Reason.

150
00:16:39,073 --> 00:16:42,907
- Backed up by murder.
- Oh, God.

151
00:16:44,233 --> 00:16:47,543
- You hate me. You hate me.
- No.

152
00:16:47,713 --> 00:16:49,704
I don't hate you.

153
00:16:51,073 --> 00:16:53,507
I dread you.

154
00:16:56,153 --> 00:17:02,342
I did what I could, Kay, to protect all
of you from the horrors of this world.

155
00:17:03,593 --> 00:17:06,312
But you became my horror.

156
00:17:15,073 --> 00:17:18,827
The children still love you, though.
Especially Mary.

157
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,468
That's something.

158
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:29,226
We can build on that. For their sake.

159
00:17:32,433 --> 00:17:34,264
Let's try.

160
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:39,587
Only if you let Tony go free to have
his own life, away from you.

161
00:17:46,553 --> 00:17:49,021
I'll let Tony go.

162
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:52,544
Thank you.

163
00:18:25,353 --> 00:18:27,583
- Hi.
- Hi.

164
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:34,227
You could hurt somebody with those.
Let me show you around.

165
00:18:34,393 --> 00:18:36,782
Can you get me an interview
with Corleone?

166
00:18:36,953 --> 00:18:41,822
No. I'm a relative, but I can't do that.
What else can I do for you?

167
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:45,106
- Handsome, but useless.
- Oh, yeah?

168
00:18:45,273 --> 00:18:48,106
- That's OK, I'll gamble.
- Do you like to gamble?

169
00:18:48,273 --> 00:18:51,982
Let's go to Atlantic City.
I'll show you how to gamble.

170
00:18:52,153 --> 00:18:56,146
- How will I know what numbers to bet?
- Do I look like a loser?

171
00:18:56,313 --> 00:18:58,224
Well...

172
00:19:00,033 --> 00:19:02,308
Spooky-looking guy there.

173
00:19:02,873 --> 00:19:07,503
- What's a guy like that doing here?
- That's Joey Zasa's bulldog.

174
00:19:07,673 --> 00:19:10,267
- You know him?
- Yeah, I do.

175
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:15,109
His name is Anthony Squigilaro.
They call him "The Ant".

176
00:19:15,273 --> 00:19:18,231
He dips his bullets in cyanide.

177
00:19:18,953 --> 00:19:21,148
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

178
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:28,383
Don Altobello.

179
00:19:29,193 --> 00:19:32,981
- I've come to pay my respects.
- Grazie.

180
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,427
You honour my father's friendship.

181
00:19:38,593 --> 00:19:41,983
Where is my god-daughter?

182
00:19:42,153 --> 00:19:44,792
- Constanza!
- Don Altobello.

183
00:19:44,953 --> 00:19:49,549
It was not so long ago
that I held you in these old hands.

184
00:19:51,313 --> 00:19:52,666
Michael...

185
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,063
(SICILIAN)

186
00:19:57,153 --> 00:20:02,068
Michael, I've lost all the venom,
all the juice of youth.

187
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:07,751
I've lost the lust for women,
and now my mind is clear.

188
00:20:07,913 --> 00:20:14,432
My duty to God is clear.
I have a special favour to ask of you.

189
00:20:15,473 --> 00:20:22,629
Can I attach my name
to the Vito Corleone Foundation,

190
00:20:22,793 --> 00:20:28,186
so that you and I can be joined
in name and spirit?

191
00:20:30,073 --> 00:20:34,749
- One million dollars.
- Oh, my!

192
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:41,267
- Godfather.
- Don Altobello, you have such a heart.

193
00:20:44,273 --> 00:20:48,266
Come, let's go and sample
some of that old vino.

194
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,904
The Vatican knows nothing
about these shareholders.

195
00:20:58,073 --> 00:20:59,392
Good.

196
00:20:59,553 --> 00:21:04,263
I have a tendency to worry. We've
increased our position substantially.

197
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:09,507
- Naturally, I worry.
- Stop worrying, we have an agreement.

198
00:21:09,713 --> 00:21:13,547
Good. How do you think
I got this grey hair?

199
00:21:13,713 --> 00:21:17,911
Two seconds... Thank you for your
contribution to the swimming-pool.

200
00:21:18,113 --> 00:21:22,106
We need your help on Sam Wallace's
candidacy for judgeship.

201
00:21:22,273 --> 00:21:24,628
- We can always use a good judge.
- Thanks.

202
00:21:24,793 --> 00:21:26,272
Andrew!

203
00:21:26,433 --> 00:21:30,426
My godson Andrew Hagen.
My brother Tom's eldest boy.

204
00:21:30,593 --> 00:21:34,472
He's been assistant
to Bishop Breelan for three years.

205
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:38,626
- Hopes to be assigned to the Vatican.
- Rome needs fine young priests.

206
00:21:38,793 --> 00:21:41,990
His mother Theresa Hagen,
Bishop Gilday.

207
00:21:42,353 --> 00:21:44,025
Honoured to meet you.

208
00:21:44,393 --> 00:21:47,351
Mr Corleone. Hi. Grace Hamilton.

209
00:21:48,353 --> 00:21:52,904
Vincent Mancini promised to tell you
about me, that maybe you'd see me.

210
00:21:53,073 --> 00:21:56,224
- Did Vincent Mancini call about her?
- No.

211
00:21:56,393 --> 00:21:59,544
- You promised to stay out there, twice.
- I know.

212
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:05,262
Joey Zasa showed up.
He's waiting in the lobby.

213
00:22:05,433 --> 00:22:09,221
He wants to personally
congratulate you. Show his respect.

214
00:22:09,393 --> 00:22:14,387
- Do I have to see him?
- He says you're his patron.

215
00:22:17,673 --> 00:22:19,789
Hey, Vinnie!

216
00:22:20,313 --> 00:22:23,032
- Who's your favourite aunt?
- You are.

217
00:22:25,433 --> 00:22:28,903
Today I'll talk to Michael
about your little problem.

218
00:22:29,513 --> 00:22:33,108
If you'd warned me,
I would have worn a better suit.

219
00:22:34,113 --> 00:22:37,105
The Meucci Association
has elected you

220
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,912
Italian-American Man of the Year.

221
00:22:41,313 --> 00:22:43,463
Meucci...

222
00:22:45,553 --> 00:22:48,021
Who's Meucci?

223
00:22:48,193 --> 00:22:53,790
The Italian-American who invented
the telephone, one year before Bell.

224
00:22:57,593 --> 00:23:00,630
And this is the reason
you've come today?

225
00:23:07,593 --> 00:23:09,743
I...

226
00:23:11,673 --> 00:23:14,107
I've got a stone in my shoe.

227
00:23:15,473 --> 00:23:18,306
A two-bit punk who works for me.

228
00:23:18,473 --> 00:23:22,466
The one who thinks he's related to you.

229
00:23:24,073 --> 00:23:25,950
A bastard.

230
00:23:29,153 --> 00:23:33,544
He's here. Vincent Mancini.
He's at the party.

231
00:23:36,393 --> 00:23:38,384
Bring him in.

232
00:23:39,433 --> 00:23:42,584
I think it's good that we talk.

233
00:23:42,873 --> 00:23:44,829
No, grazie.

234
00:23:46,433 --> 00:23:48,708
I have a problem...

235
00:23:48,873 --> 00:23:54,903
...and I want to find out if it is
my problem or your problem.

236
00:23:55,073 --> 00:24:00,511
Your business is your business. I have
no interests or percentages from it.

237
00:24:01,113 --> 00:24:04,628
Good. Then it's my problem.

238
00:24:08,353 --> 00:24:12,426
Michael, you know Vincent Mancini.
Sonny's boy.

239
00:24:14,673 --> 00:24:17,551
- How are you, Mr Corleone?
- How are you?

240
00:24:17,713 --> 00:24:21,228
- Good. How are you? Good party.
- You like it?

241
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:24,544
- Yes, I had to sneak in.
- You're dressed for it.

242
00:24:28,993 --> 00:24:33,464
So, what's the trouble
between you and Mr Joe Zasa?

243
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:39,071
- Just trouble. I'll take care of it.
- That's foolish of you.

244
00:24:39,513 --> 00:24:44,507
Foolish of me? It's a little foolish
of this guy, don't you think? Right?

245
00:24:45,593 --> 00:24:49,108
- Right?!
- Temper like his father...

246
00:24:49,273 --> 00:24:51,468
Vincent...

247
00:24:52,473 --> 00:24:57,547
Mr Joe Zasa now owns what used to
be the Corleone business in New York.

248
00:24:57,713 --> 00:25:01,626
Out of kindness,
he gave you a job in his family.

249
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:04,512
You took it against my advice.

250
00:25:04,673 --> 00:25:09,428
I offered you something better in the
legitimate world. You turned me down.

251
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:14,462
Now you both come to me with this bad
blood. What do you expect me to do?

252
00:25:16,233 --> 00:25:18,224
- Am I a gangster?
- No...

253
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:22,545
That was Papa's neighbourhood.
Zasa runs it like a disgrace!

254
00:25:22,713 --> 00:25:26,183
- That's the past, Connie.
- I earned that territory.

255
00:25:26,353 --> 00:25:30,028
The Commission gave it to me
and you approved.

256
00:25:30,193 --> 00:25:31,512
Yes.

257
00:25:31,673 --> 00:25:36,064
I came for the party, not to ask for help.
I could kill this bastard.

258
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:38,383
So kill him.

259
00:25:38,953 --> 00:25:41,831
What does all this have to do with me?

260
00:25:41,993 --> 00:25:46,942
Well, he goes behind your back,
saying "Fuck Michael Corleone".

261
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:49,547
Say it to his face, one time!

262
00:25:50,993 --> 00:25:55,987
Mr Corleone, all bastards are liars.
Shakespeare wrote poems about it.

263
00:25:56,153 --> 00:25:59,702
(VINCENT)
What am I going to do with this guy?!

264
00:26:04,953 --> 00:26:09,469
Joey, if there's some guy
running around this city,

265
00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:11,988
saying "Fuck Michael Corleone"...

266
00:26:13,513 --> 00:26:17,392
...what do we do
with a piece of shit like that?

267
00:26:18,753 --> 00:26:21,665
He's a fucking dog.

268
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:30,983
Yes, it's true.
If anyone would say such a thing,

269
00:26:31,153 --> 00:26:34,589
they would not be a friend,
they would be a dog.

270
00:26:40,313 --> 00:26:45,990
- My interests don't conflict with his.
- You don't know how much they do.

271
00:26:46,153 --> 00:26:47,745
Quiet, Vincent.

272
00:26:47,913 --> 00:26:49,949
He needs your support!

273
00:26:50,113 --> 00:26:53,708
Don't let me work for this guy,
let me work for you.

274
00:26:53,873 --> 00:26:59,584
As what? Tough guy? I don't need
tough guys. I need more lawyers.

275
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:07,749
Since we have no conflicts or debts,
I accept your tribute. I wish you well.

276
00:27:09,433 --> 00:27:13,949
Vincent, make your peace
with Mr Joe Zasa. Go on.

277
00:27:24,073 --> 00:27:26,268
Bastardo...

278
00:27:31,193 --> 00:27:33,946
Vinnie, what's the matter with you?!

279
00:27:34,113 --> 00:27:36,308
Get him out of here.

280
00:27:37,593 --> 00:27:39,584
Jesus Christ...

281
00:27:40,593 --> 00:27:43,630
- I told Connie this wasn't the right time.
- Close it.

282
00:27:43,793 --> 00:27:47,342
I know you're into Wall Street,
but you're still the final word.

283
00:27:47,513 --> 00:27:50,266
I want to protect you from these guys.
Your lawyers can't.

284
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:53,903
- But you can?
- Yeah, I can do that.

285
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:56,464
Why should I be afraid of Zasa?

286
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,466
You stop him from rising
in the Commission.

287
00:27:59,633 --> 00:28:02,864
I say we make him dead.
Give me the order, I'll do it.

288
00:28:03,033 --> 00:28:05,024
- You'll do it?
- Yeah.

289
00:28:08,993 --> 00:28:13,783
Maybe you should come with me
for a few weeks. See what happens.

290
00:28:13,953 --> 00:28:16,911
- OK.
- See if you learn.

291
00:28:17,713 --> 00:28:21,069
And we'll talk about your future.

292
00:28:21,713 --> 00:28:24,147
I won't let you down.

293
00:28:29,873 --> 00:28:32,182
It's about ready.

294
00:28:37,553 --> 00:28:38,872
What happened?

295
00:28:39,033 --> 00:28:42,708
If I'm in a room with Zasa,
what happens? I bit his ear off.

296
00:28:42,873 --> 00:28:45,751
Here we go. Watch the card.

297
00:28:48,073 --> 00:28:49,392
Hold it!

298
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:53,351
- Vincent...
- Yeah.

299
00:28:53,513 --> 00:28:55,981
Take the picture with us.

300
00:29:02,673 --> 00:29:04,903
Nice jacket.

301
00:29:06,073 --> 00:29:08,667
Closer to the centre, sir.

302
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:13,151
Smile!

303
00:29:31,673 --> 00:29:36,667
Godfather, this is the cake for you
and your family from Enzo the baker.

304
00:29:37,273 --> 00:29:39,548
Do you want to do it?

305
00:30:23,433 --> 00:30:26,152
Cent'anni! Cent'anni!

306
00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:26,664
- Vincent?
- What do you want, sweetheart?

307
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,862
Do you love me?

308
00:31:31,593 --> 00:31:35,791
- Come on, go to bed.
- Come on, say it.

309
00:31:35,953 --> 00:31:38,148
I love you.

310
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,463
I love you, too.

311
00:31:40,633 --> 00:31:42,351
(SLIGHT SOUND)

312
00:31:42,513 --> 00:31:44,663
You've got a cat?

313
00:31:50,713 --> 00:31:53,830
Go get us some water, I'm thirsty.
Come on.

314
00:31:54,473 --> 00:31:56,464
Come on.

315
00:32:02,793 --> 00:32:06,024
Well, I guess I know my place.

316
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:09,983
I can't believe I'm actually doing this.

317
00:32:10,153 --> 00:32:14,146
"Get me water, bake me a cake"...
What happened to "please"?

318
00:32:59,913 --> 00:33:02,666
(VINCENT)
Good boy, Sackface. Go for a walk.

319
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:14,064
- Let her go.
- Cut her throat, man.

320
00:33:16,273 --> 00:33:19,424
- What did you say?
- Cut her fucking throat.

321
00:33:22,153 --> 00:33:25,350
- OK, chief...
- Drop your gun or he'll cut her throat.

322
00:33:25,513 --> 00:33:29,108
I hardly know her, so cut her.
What the fuck do I care?

323
00:33:31,193 --> 00:33:34,788
You've got no choice. She'll be dead.

324
00:33:34,953 --> 00:33:38,946
If you do, I'll kill you both.
Give up that knife, I'll let you go.

325
00:33:39,113 --> 00:33:41,388
Cut her throat! Right now!

326
00:33:42,473 --> 00:33:47,149
I'll do something that'll convince you.
Don't get frightened. Just watch me.

327
00:33:51,953 --> 00:33:53,466
Oh, shit!

328
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:57,788
Drop the knife. Drop it!

329
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:03,664
Good boy. Sit down, I want to talk
to you. It was a wise choice. Sit down.

330
00:34:04,473 --> 00:34:06,464
Lose the mask.

331
00:34:09,153 --> 00:34:12,429
Relax, have a smoke. You smoke?

332
00:34:14,073 --> 00:34:17,065
Whose idea was this? Who sent you?

333
00:34:17,393 --> 00:34:20,032
Tell me who sent you.

334
00:34:22,073 --> 00:34:24,712
- No one.
- Did you take a look at this guy?

335
00:34:24,873 --> 00:34:27,148
- Yeah.
- Who sent you?

336
00:34:29,713 --> 00:34:31,988
It was Joey Zasa.

337
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,301
Are you OK?

338
00:34:50,473 --> 00:34:53,465
- You were going to let them kill me!
- No, I wasn't...

339
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,830
You pig! You sick fuck!

340
00:34:57,993 --> 00:35:01,986
You wanted gambling. That's gambling.
Call the police.

341
00:35:06,233 --> 00:35:10,067
- You killed the other guy too?
- He went for my gun.

342
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:13,669
It was self-defence.
Go ahead, call the police.

343
00:35:14,473 --> 00:35:16,464
- No, no...
- I'm taking pictures.

344
00:35:16,633 --> 00:35:18,863
No pictures.

345
00:35:20,033 --> 00:35:21,386
You had a gun!

346
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:26,422
They only had a knife. You could have
handed them over to the police.

347
00:35:26,593 --> 00:35:30,347
Zasa sent them.
I just sent him a message.

348
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:36,027
- Now he has to send you one back.
- Is Zasa going to send me one back?

349
00:35:36,193 --> 00:35:38,946
He did the right thing.
He got Zasa's name!

350
00:35:39,113 --> 00:35:44,107
What has Joey Zasa to do
with anything? Joey Zasa is a pazzo.

351
00:35:46,113 --> 00:35:48,866
All right. You are what you are.

352
00:35:49,193 --> 00:35:52,071
It's your nature. Stay close to me.

353
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,942
Don't do anything. Keep your mouth
shut and your eyes open.

354
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:59,105
- And you do what I tell you.
- I understand.

355
00:35:59,273 --> 00:36:03,027
- I have problems with the Commission.
- I know.

356
00:36:03,193 --> 00:36:07,789
- You don't make them easier.
- It wasn't my idea that this happened.

357
00:36:07,953 --> 00:36:10,751
- Get out of here.
- Michael...

358
00:36:10,913 --> 00:36:12,904
Yes?

359
00:36:13,393 --> 00:36:17,989
- Now they'll fear you.
- Maybe they should fear you.

360
00:36:20,953 --> 00:36:24,582
- B.J., what's up?
- The Archbishop just called back.

361
00:36:24,753 --> 00:36:27,631
We've arranged some amazing things.

362
00:36:27,793 --> 00:36:32,548
The publicity is phenomenal. You're
the new Rockefeller. A philanthropist.

363
00:36:33,673 --> 00:36:37,302
- Sign here, please.
- Times do change, don't they?

364
00:36:37,473 --> 00:36:42,467
My father hated foundations.
He loved doing it by himself.

365
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:45,712
Man to man. But we're different.

366
00:36:45,873 --> 00:36:50,583
No different than any large corporation.
We control a lot of money with little.

367
00:36:50,753 --> 00:36:55,383
Minimise taxes.
With no government control.

368
00:37:03,753 --> 00:37:07,063
- Godfather.
- Andrew.

369
00:37:08,633 --> 00:37:13,070
- Off to Rome...
- I wanted to thank you for everything.

370
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:16,225
- Do you want some breakfast?
- Thanks, I can't.

371
00:37:16,393 --> 00:37:20,227
- How's your Italian?
- Devo fare un po' di pratica.

372
00:37:21,393 --> 00:37:23,668
- His father was a great lawyer.
- I know.

373
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:28,304
Didn't live to see him ordained. I did.
Did you ever see one of those?

374
00:37:28,473 --> 00:37:31,943
Beautiful. I was so proud.
Let me walk you out.

375
00:37:33,033 --> 00:37:36,025
If you hear any rumours in the Vatican,
let me know.

376
00:37:36,193 --> 00:37:38,912
No, Andrew has the true faith.

377
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,270
Don Corleone,

378
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:53,824
I need your help. And not just
to light a little candle.

379
00:37:54,993 --> 00:38:01,705
My gift was to be able to persuade
people to give to the Holy Church.

380
00:38:02,433 --> 00:38:07,188
Then Rome decides to put me
in charge of the Vatican Bank...

381
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,911
...but I was never a true banker.

382
00:38:14,633 --> 00:38:18,945
Mea culpa. I trusted my friends.

383
00:38:19,913 --> 00:38:22,222
Friendship and money...

384
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:24,751
Oil and water...

385
00:38:24,913 --> 00:38:26,505
Indeed.

386
00:38:26,673 --> 00:38:33,385
But these "friends" used the good name
of the Church to feed their greed.

387
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,913
If money was lost...

388
00:38:37,913 --> 00:38:40,473
...then I am to blame.

389
00:38:41,073 --> 00:38:46,705
If only prayer could pay off
our 700 million dollar deficit.

390
00:38:48,313 --> 00:38:50,952
769 million...

391
00:38:56,313 --> 00:39:01,307
The Church owns 25 percent
of a large corporation: Lmmobiliare.

392
00:39:02,153 --> 00:39:04,144
You know the one I mean?

393
00:39:04,313 --> 00:39:09,307
Largest landlord on Earth.
Real estate worth six billion dollars.

394
00:39:10,993 --> 00:39:12,904
That's true.

395
00:39:13,073 --> 00:39:17,066
And the Vatican vote
is necessary for control.

396
00:39:19,473 --> 00:39:22,385
No, you're mistaken.

397
00:39:22,553 --> 00:39:26,751
This isn't a question of one person
deciding, one deciding vote.

398
00:39:26,913 --> 00:39:32,624
This is like any other company.
We have directors and very old rules.

399
00:39:33,393 --> 00:39:38,069
The Pope himself
would have to approve you.

400
00:39:41,953 --> 00:39:44,183
We've sold the casinos.

401
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:49,421
All businesses having to do
with gambling.

402
00:39:49,593 --> 00:39:55,145
We have no interests or investments
in anything illegitimate.

403
00:39:57,833 --> 00:40:02,543
The Corleones are prepared to deposit
500 million dollars in the Vatican Bank

404
00:40:02,713 --> 00:40:05,705
when Mr Corleone receives majority
control at lmmobiliare.

405
00:40:05,873 --> 00:40:11,186
Immobiliare could be something new.
A European conglomerate.

406
00:40:12,193 --> 00:40:16,345
Few families have control
of such a company.

407
00:40:19,313 --> 00:40:22,066
It seems that, in today's world,

408
00:40:22,233 --> 00:40:27,227
the power to absolve debt is greater
than the power of forgiveness.

409
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:30,463
600 million dollars.

410
00:40:35,073 --> 00:40:38,782
Don't overestimate
the power of forgiveness.

411
00:40:40,153 --> 00:40:42,064
Don Corleone,

412
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:47,068
this deal with lmmobiliare can make you
one of the richest men in the world.

413
00:40:47,233 --> 00:40:52,546
Your whole past history, and the history
of your family, would be washed away.

414
00:40:56,233 --> 00:40:58,701
600 million.

415
00:41:13,193 --> 00:41:17,983
The motion under discussion
relates to Corleone Group's proposal

416
00:41:18,153 --> 00:41:23,546
to acquire 100,000,000 newly-issued
Class A voting shares.

417
00:41:25,073 --> 00:41:31,546
...Corleone capital invested directly
into International lmmobiliare,

418
00:41:31,713 --> 00:41:35,467
an old and respected
European company.

419
00:41:35,633 --> 00:41:40,787
Mr Corleone has an ambitious programme
to expand this real estate company

420
00:41:40,953 --> 00:41:43,831
into an international conglomerate...

421
00:41:47,153 --> 00:41:51,943
...threatened by Eastern techniques
of efficiency and focus and unlimited...

422
00:41:52,113 --> 00:41:54,991
Mr Corleone, excuse me.

423
00:41:55,153 --> 00:41:58,668
Didn't you recently deposit 200 million
in the Vatican Bank,

424
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:01,666
which is affiliated with lmmobiliare?

425
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:03,312
True. Why not?

426
00:42:03,473 --> 00:42:08,706
Wasn't there any questioning about
the timing on this particular deposit?

427
00:42:09,433 --> 00:42:11,901
Mr Chairman, if I may?

428
00:42:13,193 --> 00:42:17,664
The Vito Andolini Corleone Foundation,
of which Mary Corleone is chairman,

429
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:21,030
has made an endowment
of 100 million dollars.

430
00:42:21,193 --> 00:42:25,266
The money comes from his own family
and will be administered by the Vatican.

431
00:42:25,433 --> 00:42:27,947
Does that answer your question?

432
00:42:28,113 --> 00:42:34,222
I have always believed that helping your
fellow man is profitable in every sense,

433
00:42:34,393 --> 00:42:36,861
personally and bottom line.

434
00:42:37,113 --> 00:42:42,551
My fellow shareholders, if Europe
and America can learn to co-operate,

435
00:42:42,713 --> 00:42:46,592
if we can learn to pool our wealth,
share our markets,

436
00:42:46,753 --> 00:42:51,588
we can defeat any competition
anywhere in the world.

437
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,747
Thank you for your time.

438
00:42:54,913 --> 00:42:59,350
I hope that you will look favourably
on my proposal. Thank you.

439
00:43:04,713 --> 00:43:07,591
Let me have this microphone here.

440
00:43:07,753 --> 00:43:12,873
Will we let a criminal run our company?
He's got the map of Sicily on his face!

441
00:43:13,033 --> 00:43:14,512
Order!

442
00:43:14,673 --> 00:43:17,585
He's either a Catholic or a mafioso...

443
00:43:19,193 --> 00:43:23,709
The Hamilton Investors Group
cannot support this proposal.

444
00:43:24,273 --> 00:43:25,592
Your Excellency...

445
00:43:26,633 --> 00:43:28,112
Mr Chairman...

446
00:43:28,873 --> 00:43:34,869
...the Vatican Bank feels
that International lmmobiliare...

447
00:43:36,713 --> 00:43:40,672
...will be safe in Mr Corleone's hands.

448
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:45,623
...subject to audit and final ratification,
which must take place in Rome.

449
00:43:45,793 --> 00:43:49,547
Please join me in welcoming
Mr Michael Corleone.

450
00:43:59,153 --> 00:44:00,905
Dad?

451
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:06,702
Tony says that I'm a front
for the foundation.

452
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:11,428
That you're using me to pull the strings.

453
00:44:11,593 --> 00:44:14,585
- To get the money where you want it.
- Please!

454
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:17,790
- To shine up your public image.
- Mary!

455
00:44:18,513 --> 00:44:22,506
Mary, this is real.
This foundation is real.

456
00:44:24,833 --> 00:44:29,668
I wanted Anthony to be part of it.
I thought you would be together on this.

457
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:34,031
I won't interfere.
I'll help, but only if you ask.

458
00:44:34,193 --> 00:44:36,753
What is this really for?

459
00:44:36,913 --> 00:44:41,543
Why are you doing this?
Why am I doing this?

460
00:44:41,713 --> 00:44:46,628
I'm doing this for my children.
You're doing it for your children too.

461
00:44:47,033 --> 00:44:50,105
This foundation is supposed
to help all people?

462
00:44:50,273 --> 00:44:51,752
That's the purpose.

463
00:44:52,593 --> 00:44:57,189
This is legitimate.
Mary, I swear, this is legitimate.

464
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:04,463
Dad, I want this to bring me
closer to you.

465
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:16,065
I would burn in hell to keep you safe.

466
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:31,991
Go in the other car. I'll ride with Michael.

467
00:45:32,153 --> 00:45:34,144
Go, go, go.

468
00:45:47,233 --> 00:45:53,024
As your family's oldest friend, I'm
always chosen to bring you messages.

469
00:45:55,153 --> 00:45:58,145
Tell me, Don Altobello.

470
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:03,666
Your old partners are grateful
for the money you made them.

471
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:06,142
They worship you...

472
00:46:07,113 --> 00:46:12,983
...but their hearts are broken
because they think you abandoned them.

473
00:46:13,433 --> 00:46:19,383
They want to share your deal
on lmmobiliare, to be a family again.

474
00:46:19,713 --> 00:46:22,307
It can purify their money.

475
00:46:24,273 --> 00:46:26,741
This I cannot do.

476
00:46:28,593 --> 00:46:32,302
Immobiliare must be legitimate.

477
00:46:33,433 --> 00:46:35,867
I know.

478
00:46:36,033 --> 00:46:38,547
But they're unhappy.

479
00:46:40,033 --> 00:46:41,864
And you?

480
00:46:42,033 --> 00:46:47,903
I ask nothing for myself,
only peace in my old age.

481
00:46:48,073 --> 00:46:51,622
But I must please the world around me.

482
00:46:52,753 --> 00:46:58,988
Michael, your father was
a reasonable man. Learn from him.

483
00:47:00,993 --> 00:47:04,463
I learned many things from my father.

484
00:47:09,433 --> 00:47:14,951
Call a meeting, my friend,
so there are no debts or grudges.

485
00:47:16,153 --> 00:47:19,225
We will make the peace, you and I.

486
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:28,789
(ITALIAN RADIO) The Vatican
announced today

487
00:47:28,953 --> 00:47:33,071
that Pope Paul VI has cancelled
his Sunday blessing

488
00:47:33,233 --> 00:47:35,383
due to ill health.

489
00:47:35,553 --> 00:47:41,025
His physician has ordered total bedrest

490
00:47:41,193 --> 00:47:43,946
and cessation of all activities.

491
00:47:44,113 --> 00:47:46,104
(RADIO CONTINUES)

492
00:47:57,073 --> 00:48:02,431
They've had a press conference. The
Pope's condition is grave. "Gravissimo."

493
00:48:17,793 --> 00:48:19,909
(THEY PRAY)

494
00:48:28,273 --> 00:48:32,471
Gentlemen, the purpose
of this meeting is to establish

495
00:48:32,633 --> 00:48:37,423
that we all agree to what was decided
at the shareholder meeting in New York.

496
00:48:38,193 --> 00:48:40,184
Please...

497
00:48:40,353 --> 00:48:44,824
Our group represents a consortium
of Catholic businessmen

498
00:48:44,993 --> 00:48:47,985
against the Corleone control.

499
00:48:48,433 --> 00:48:53,268
The Vatican has cast its vote. Corleone
Group already controls the Board.

500
00:48:53,553 --> 00:48:58,069
According to the Lateran Treaty,
the Vatican vote must be ratified here.

501
00:48:58,233 --> 00:49:00,793
Here in Rome, by the Pope.

502
00:49:04,113 --> 00:49:07,583
The Pope is gravely ill.

503
00:49:08,473 --> 00:49:12,546
Until he recovers, I am powerless.

504
00:49:13,073 --> 00:49:15,951
- What if he dies?
- Then...

505
00:49:16,873 --> 00:49:19,990
...as you Americans say,
all bets are off.

506
00:49:20,153 --> 00:49:22,713
Gentlemen, please.

507
00:49:23,433 --> 00:49:27,551
This is a brief delay. Nothing more.

508
00:49:31,393 --> 00:49:34,624
Your Excellency, gentlemen...

509
00:49:35,033 --> 00:49:40,505
I advise you to join us in our prayers
for the Holy Father's recovery.

510
00:49:41,553 --> 00:49:43,225
We had an agreement!

511
00:49:44,473 --> 00:49:48,182
This meeting was to be
merely a formality.

512
00:49:48,353 --> 00:49:53,268
- Please sit down.
- I'd rather stand. Give me an answer.

513
00:49:53,433 --> 00:49:58,712
The lmmobiliare has its roots in the
European tradition. Please understand.

514
00:49:59,353 --> 00:50:02,663
I understand.
Your tactics are despicable.

515
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,825
That's quite an indictment,
coming from a Corleone.

516
00:50:05,993 --> 00:50:10,987
- Gentlemen, gentlemen!
- Remember you are in the Vatican.

517
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:19,429
- What is it that you want?
- Yes, you will take control.

518
00:50:20,073 --> 00:50:23,986
We'll gladly put you at the helm
of our little fleet,

519
00:50:24,153 --> 00:50:28,066
but our ships must all sail
in the same direction.

520
00:50:29,313 --> 00:50:35,229
Otherwise, who can say how long
your stay with us will last?

521
00:50:36,873 --> 00:50:43,142
It's not personal. It's only business.
You should know, Godfather.

522
00:50:46,353 --> 00:50:47,786
Very well.

523
00:50:48,913 --> 00:50:53,748
You want to do business with me?
I will do business with you.

524
00:50:54,713 --> 00:50:57,307
Vipers, all of them.

525
00:51:02,353 --> 00:51:05,345
- We're back with the Borgias!
- Uncle Michael...

526
00:51:05,513 --> 00:51:08,391
- Andrew!
- I heard you were here.

527
00:51:08,553 --> 00:51:12,785
It's so nice to see you.
Vincent, it's so nice.

528
00:51:12,953 --> 00:51:15,990
What is this about the Borgias?
Those days are over.

529
00:51:21,313 --> 00:51:24,111
- Recognise it?
- Yeah.

530
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:29,583
Genco Olive Oil. That's where our
grandfather started as a delivery boy.

531
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,551
Three years later he owned it.

532
00:51:32,993 --> 00:51:35,985
- Only in America.
- That's it.

533
00:51:36,153 --> 00:51:41,147
Vincenzo, where have you been hiding?
We need your help so badly.

534
00:51:41,313 --> 00:51:45,306
- What can I do for you?
- Get rid of Joe Zasa. He sells drugs...

535
00:51:45,473 --> 00:51:49,785
Now that I'm an older woman,
I'm afraid to go out at night.

536
00:51:49,953 --> 00:51:52,103
Where should they be now?

537
00:51:52,273 --> 00:51:55,265
- Lou, what's going on?
- We're late.

538
00:51:57,033 --> 00:51:59,501
- Have I ever let you down?
- I trust you.

539
00:51:59,673 --> 00:52:01,982
- Don't worry.
- Thank you.

540
00:52:02,153 --> 00:52:03,871
Enjoy yourselves.

541
00:52:10,033 --> 00:52:14,345
- What was that?
- The neighbourhood's in trouble.

542
00:52:14,753 --> 00:52:17,392
- Do you keep an eye out for them?
- Yes.

543
00:52:17,553 --> 00:52:20,431
- And for me?
- From now on.

544
00:52:21,233 --> 00:52:25,067
- I've missed you all this time.
- I missed you too, cousin.

545
00:52:25,233 --> 00:52:30,261
I missed growing up with my cousins.
I didn't even know you, but missed you.

546
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:35,145
Do you remember stories
about our fathers? The old days?

547
00:52:35,313 --> 00:52:38,305
Yeah, what do you want to know?

548
00:52:39,873 --> 00:52:45,550
- What was Sonny like?
- Well, he was the Prince of the City.

549
00:52:46,473 --> 00:52:50,227
He died before I was born,
but I've heard a lot about him.

550
00:52:51,713 --> 00:52:55,342
- What about my father?
- He's a great man.

551
00:52:56,553 --> 00:52:59,272
He's a hero. He saved the family.

552
00:53:00,473 --> 00:53:02,464
- Vincent?
- What?

553
00:53:02,633 --> 00:53:05,101
Did he kill his own brother?

554
00:53:09,033 --> 00:53:10,864
No.

555
00:53:12,753 --> 00:53:15,187
So, it's all lies?

556
00:53:18,233 --> 00:53:21,828
Just stories, sweetheart. OK?

557
00:53:25,433 --> 00:53:27,151
OK.

558
00:53:28,433 --> 00:53:30,663
I believe you.

559
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:34,746
- I'm glad you're around.
- I'm glad you're here too.

560
00:53:39,073 --> 00:53:41,029
Cugina...

561
00:53:41,233 --> 00:53:43,224
Cuz...

562
00:53:56,473 --> 00:53:59,704
I'd like to take Joey Zasa
for a ride and drop him.

563
00:53:59,873 --> 00:54:02,512
Joey Zasa is nothing.

564
00:54:02,673 --> 00:54:06,382
He's a small-time enforcer.
He bluffs and threatens.

565
00:54:06,553 --> 00:54:10,387
He's nothing. You can see him coming
a mile away.

566
00:54:11,033 --> 00:54:14,025
- We should kill him before he...
- No!

567
00:54:16,473 --> 00:54:21,069
Never hate your enemies.
It affects your judgement.

568
00:54:36,113 --> 00:54:38,707
Nice to see you again, Mr Corleone.

569
00:54:58,353 --> 00:55:00,992
Hey, girls. Let's go.

570
00:55:17,473 --> 00:55:21,751
We trusted you to manage
our money in the casinos.

571
00:55:21,913 --> 00:55:27,510
It's not even 20 years. You've sold the
casinos and made fortunes for all of us.

572
00:55:27,673 --> 00:55:29,982
Bravo, Don Corleone!

573
00:55:31,713 --> 00:55:33,032
Thank you.

574
00:55:33,953 --> 00:55:40,950
Friends, I have come here
because our business together is done.

575
00:55:42,033 --> 00:55:43,751
We have prospered,

576
00:55:43,913 --> 00:55:49,624
and now it is time for us to dissolve
the business relationship between us.

577
00:55:50,873 --> 00:55:52,829
That's it.

578
00:55:52,993 --> 00:55:56,383
But I do have a little surprise. Al?

579
00:55:58,633 --> 00:56:01,147
Your shares in the casinos.

580
00:56:01,313 --> 00:56:05,306
I've cut the red tape, so you could
get your money right away.

581
00:56:11,673 --> 00:56:13,903
50 million dollars!

582
00:56:14,073 --> 00:56:17,383
- Not everybody gets the same.
- Nothing for you...

583
00:56:17,553 --> 00:56:23,185
- It depends on your investment.
- Michael, this is really generous!

584
00:56:23,353 --> 00:56:24,672
Wonderful!

585
00:56:24,833 --> 00:56:27,301
(WHISTLES) Grazie!

586
00:56:27,553 --> 00:56:32,673
- Parisi, how much did you invest?
- I don't remember.

587
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:34,789
You're blessed.

588
00:56:39,193 --> 00:56:44,392
My family has done much of
the hard work, taken many risks.

589
00:56:45,953 --> 00:56:48,865
All to make money
for the rest of the families.

590
00:56:51,193 --> 00:56:53,661
You all know Joey Zasa.

591
00:56:53,953 --> 00:56:56,945
He is, I admit, an important man.

592
00:56:57,433 --> 00:57:01,585
His picture is on the cover
of the New York Times magazine.

593
00:57:01,753 --> 00:57:06,349
He gets the Esquire Magazine award
for the best-dressed gangster.

594
00:57:06,513 --> 00:57:08,390
The newspapers praise him

595
00:57:08,553 --> 00:57:12,910
because he hires Blacks,
which shows he has a good heart.

596
00:57:15,393 --> 00:57:17,588
He is famous.

597
00:57:17,753 --> 00:57:23,544
Who knows? Maybe one day
he'll make all of you popular.

598
00:57:25,153 --> 00:57:26,472
It's true.

599
00:57:26,633 --> 00:57:31,866
I make more of a bella figura.
That is my nature.

600
00:57:32,033 --> 00:57:36,743
But I also want to make a move
into legitimate enterprises.

601
00:57:36,913 --> 00:57:39,507
I'd like a little pin from the Pope.

602
00:57:39,953 --> 00:57:44,822
Sure, I take the Blacks and the Spanish
into my family,

603
00:57:44,993 --> 00:57:48,144
because that's America.

604
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:52,826
And you guarantee
that they don't deal drugs?

605
00:57:53,673 --> 00:57:58,906
I don't guarantee that. I guarantee
that I'll kill anybody who does.

606
00:58:02,593 --> 00:58:07,621
- Let me talk to him.
- Who can refuse Don Altobello?

607
00:58:07,993 --> 00:58:10,826
- Joey, are you...
- No!

608
00:58:10,993 --> 00:58:16,511
I say to all of you: I have been
treated this day with no respect.

609
00:58:17,353 --> 00:58:22,347
I've earned you all money.
I've made you rich and I asked for little.

610
00:58:22,513 --> 00:58:26,870
Good. You will not give, so I'll take!

611
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:30,181
As for Don Corleone,

612
00:58:30,353 --> 00:58:36,189
he makes it very clear to me today
that he is my enemy.

613
00:58:39,633 --> 00:58:42,386
You must choose between us.

614
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:47,865
No, Joey!

615
00:58:48,913 --> 00:58:51,791
Michael, we could reason together.

616
00:58:51,953 --> 00:58:53,466
No.

617
00:58:54,633 --> 00:58:58,831
Michael, please... let's agree.

618
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:01,268
He doesn't know what he's...

619
00:59:01,433 --> 00:59:03,264
No, no.

620
00:59:07,193 --> 00:59:10,583
Michael, the news is everywhere.

621
00:59:11,313 --> 00:59:14,862
Everyone says that you
control lmmobiliare.

622
00:59:15,033 --> 00:59:20,346
Immobiliare is already laundering
money in Peru and Nassau.

623
00:59:21,233 --> 00:59:25,784
We've worked with you for 40 years.
We should wet our beaks a little.

624
00:59:25,953 --> 00:59:30,981
- We want to do business with you.
- That's right, we've been together...

625
00:59:39,753 --> 00:59:43,063
- It's a hit! Let's go!
- Let's get out of here! Move!

626
01:00:01,353 --> 01:00:04,186
My coat! It's my lucky coat!

627
01:00:05,193 --> 01:00:07,184
It's my lucky coat!

628
01:00:12,833 --> 01:00:15,267
Stay behind me!

629
01:00:29,753 --> 01:00:31,550
Mikey, this way!

630
01:00:39,793 --> 01:00:42,705
Zasa, you son-of-a-bitch...

631
01:01:02,513 --> 01:01:05,073
Come on. We're out of here.

632
01:01:35,553 --> 01:01:38,021
- You did good, Vincent.
- Grazie.

633
01:01:38,193 --> 01:01:41,503
The old Dons were pretty much
wiped out.

634
01:01:41,673 --> 01:01:44,506
The survivors made deals with Zasa.

635
01:01:45,633 --> 01:01:48,022
- Altobello?
- He survived.

636
01:01:48,193 --> 01:01:53,267
He's with his daughters in Staten Island.
He says he's going to retire in Sicily.

637
01:01:54,673 --> 01:01:59,508
Joey Zasa would never pull something
like this without the backing.

638
01:01:59,673 --> 01:02:05,145
He's just muscle. He doesn't have
the wit for that helicopter attack.

639
01:02:05,313 --> 01:02:09,511
He doesn't even have the ambition
to wipe out the whole Commission.

640
01:02:09,673 --> 01:02:12,471
I say we hit back and take Zasa out!

641
01:02:17,593 --> 01:02:20,585
Never let anyone know
what you're thinking.

642
01:02:28,193 --> 01:02:31,185
Let's get a message to Joey Zasa.

643
01:02:34,113 --> 01:02:36,911
I respect what he's done.

644
01:02:37,433 --> 01:02:40,505
The new overthrows the old. It's natural.

645
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:44,302
How can you do business
with this guy?

646
01:02:45,433 --> 01:02:49,426
I'm a businessman, first and foremost.
I want no further conflict.

647
01:02:49,593 --> 01:02:54,383
- Tell him that he can live or he can die.
- Vincent, will you shut up!

648
01:03:11,513 --> 01:03:13,504
That's it.

649
01:03:15,193 --> 01:03:17,024
Joey Zasa...

650
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:19,866
He can't be doing this alone.

651
01:03:22,993 --> 01:03:27,748
Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in.

652
01:03:35,193 --> 01:03:40,745
Our true enemy has not yet
shown his face.

653
01:03:44,953 --> 01:03:46,625
Michael!

654
01:03:52,873 --> 01:03:56,866
- Has he had his medicine?
- I don't know what he took.

655
01:03:59,033 --> 01:04:02,867
- I've got my wind back.
- Call a doctor.

656
01:04:03,033 --> 01:04:05,786
- Run, run, run!
- Vincent!

657
01:04:05,953 --> 01:04:08,023
Run at thunder, girl! Thunder can't hurt!

658
01:04:09,673 --> 01:04:12,107
Harmless noise!

659
01:04:12,273 --> 01:04:16,824
Bullshit! You deceitful old fuck!

660
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:19,908
Altobello, you fuck!

661
01:04:22,833 --> 01:04:24,630
Fredo!

662
01:04:25,033 --> 01:04:26,466
Fredo!

663
01:04:49,033 --> 01:04:51,945
Oh, God! Dad!

664
01:04:53,873 --> 01:04:55,989
Excuse me.

665
01:04:56,153 --> 01:04:58,144
I'll call Kay.

666
01:05:07,913 --> 01:05:11,906
- Good evening, sir.
- Can we wait here? We'll be back soon.

667
01:05:17,953 --> 01:05:24,267
Mr Harrison, you said it was urgent.
Have you come to confess your sins?

668
01:05:24,473 --> 01:05:29,388
Michael Corleone has had a diabetic
stroke. I wanted you to know about it.

669
01:05:29,553 --> 01:05:34,183
He's in a coma. I'm here to insist
the deal goes through in any event.

670
01:05:34,353 --> 01:05:36,389
The Pope has not much time left.

671
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:41,712
So, as you, I am in a difficult position.

672
01:05:41,873 --> 01:05:45,707
We have to ratify this deal
as soon as possible.

673
01:05:45,873 --> 01:05:48,865
- We have an understanding.
- Good.

674
01:05:49,793 --> 01:05:53,786
- I'm going to the hospital.
- I'll pray for Mr Corleone.

675
01:05:57,793 --> 01:06:01,786
- Our thoughts are with Mr Corleone.
- Thank you, Father Jim.

676
01:06:04,073 --> 01:06:08,305
Everything would be out in the open
if Corleone dies.

677
01:06:08,953 --> 01:06:11,069
Play for time, Keinszig.

678
01:06:11,753 --> 01:06:16,429
A habit born of a long contemplation
of eternity.

679
01:06:22,473 --> 01:06:26,466
- Forget about it, Vinnie.
- Why? It's a simple hit.

680
01:06:26,633 --> 01:06:32,310
I'd love to smack Joey Zasa and then
whack the fag. But it's impossible.

681
01:06:32,473 --> 01:06:37,706
He's always with people, in front of TV
cameras in his own neighbourhood.

682
01:06:37,873 --> 01:06:41,263
- It's not impossible. It'll work for us.
- How?

683
01:06:41,433 --> 01:06:46,109
Do you think he's going to let
Uncle Michael survive? Would you?

684
01:06:46,273 --> 01:06:49,071
He may not survive anyway.

685
01:06:49,553 --> 01:06:53,262
- How would you do it?
- I'd do it myself.

686
01:06:54,753 --> 01:06:56,789
Do it!

687
01:06:58,353 --> 01:07:01,231
- What would you need?
- A couple of guys.

688
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:33,022
Hello, Michael.

689
01:07:35,273 --> 01:07:37,264
It's Kay.

690
01:07:41,553 --> 01:07:43,191
Kay...

691
01:07:45,153 --> 01:07:47,508
I never expected you.

692
01:07:47,913 --> 01:07:50,108
No, I know.

693
01:07:52,353 --> 01:07:54,150
But I'm here.

694
01:07:57,713 --> 01:08:00,181
- I'm glad.
- You know...

695
01:08:02,953 --> 01:08:05,547
I've never seen you looking so helpless.

696
01:08:09,833 --> 01:08:12,393
It's not so bad, really.

697
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:17,985
I feel... l'm getting wiser now.

698
01:08:18,153 --> 01:08:20,428
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

699
01:08:21,113 --> 01:08:26,745
- The sicker you get, the wiser you get?
- When I'm dead, I'll be really smart.

700
01:08:28,033 --> 01:08:32,424
Michael... I want to thank you for Tony.

701
01:08:35,113 --> 01:08:39,311
He's doing really well.
He's gotten some very good notices,

702
01:08:39,473 --> 01:08:44,945
and he'll make his operatic debut
in Sicily, in Palermo this Easter, so...

703
01:08:46,353 --> 01:08:47,945
So, thank you.

704
01:08:49,033 --> 01:08:52,582
That's a real honour. In Sicily.

705
01:08:57,033 --> 01:09:00,105
I will be there. I won't miss that.

706
01:09:00,713 --> 01:09:02,510
I won't miss that.

707
01:09:08,313 --> 01:09:10,781
Mary, Tony...

708
01:09:11,993 --> 01:09:14,188
Go see Dad.

709
01:09:19,033 --> 01:09:22,503
- Sweetheart!
- Everything's going to be all right.

710
01:09:22,913 --> 01:09:25,985
- Tony!
- How are you doing, Pop?

711
01:09:27,993 --> 01:09:31,144
Your mother told me what happened.

712
01:09:31,313 --> 01:09:36,990
- About Palermo? I hope you'll be there.
- Of course. Kiss me.

713
01:09:55,633 --> 01:10:01,151
- Cousin Vinnie?
- He's not here. Call his apartmen

714
01:10:01,313 --> 01:10:04,749
- It's your cousin Mary.
- Let her in.

715
01:10:08,513 --> 01:10:12,472
Hi, cuz. I thought I'd drop by.
Is that OK?

716
01:10:12,633 --> 01:10:15,193
I'll get the guys.

717
01:10:16,233 --> 01:10:19,703
No, it's not OK.
You shouldn't have come, Mary.

718
01:10:20,713 --> 01:10:23,068
Only a couple of minutes, OK?

719
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:27,629
- You look beautiful, cuz.
- Thanks.

720
01:10:29,993 --> 01:10:33,269
So this is your club, your hideout?

721
01:10:33,433 --> 01:10:36,550
- Yeah.
- I came here to check it out.

722
01:10:40,633 --> 01:10:44,626
It's so strange, just me
and Aunt Connie in the house.

723
01:10:44,793 --> 01:10:49,264
- I feel better when I'm with you.
- What's wrong, sweetheart?

724
01:10:49,433 --> 01:10:52,027
- I'm scared about my father.
- Don't be.

725
01:10:52,193 --> 01:10:56,505
When they took him out of
the ambulance, I thought he was dead.

726
01:10:56,673 --> 01:10:59,665
Everybody says he's going to be better.

727
01:11:00,473 --> 01:11:02,464
Don't worry.

728
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:05,386
I remember a shooting when I was little.

729
01:11:06,513 --> 01:11:11,303
And one time Al Neri and other
bodyguards took me and Tony away.

730
01:11:12,753 --> 01:11:15,745
Is it all happening again?

731
01:11:16,273 --> 01:11:18,741
Not like that, sweetie.

732
01:11:19,913 --> 01:11:24,384
Then why are you hiding here?
Is something going to happen to you?

733
01:11:25,273 --> 01:11:29,983
Nothing's going to happen to me,
cugina. We'll take care of you.

734
01:11:39,953 --> 01:11:44,310
- Can I stay here and hide out with you?
- Can you help me cook for the boys?

735
01:11:44,473 --> 01:11:48,466
You know that I don't know
how to cook, but I'll help.

736
01:12:00,353 --> 01:12:02,344
OK...

737
01:12:02,513 --> 01:12:04,504
What do I do?

738
01:12:35,033 --> 01:12:38,469
- I love you, cuz.
- I love you, too.

739
01:12:41,593 --> 01:12:43,902
Let us cook.

740
01:12:59,273 --> 01:13:01,264
Hold me.

741
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:40,424
You in the press and the police
use words like "Mafia", "Cosa Nostra".

742
01:13:40,593 --> 01:13:45,826
This is a fantasy. We Italian-Americans
laid the bricks that built this city.

743
01:13:45,993 --> 01:13:48,461
We have Meucci,
who invented the telephone.

744
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:52,148
We have Don Ameche,
who played the guy who invented it.

745
01:13:52,313 --> 01:13:56,226
Buy yourself a raffle ticket,
maybe you'll win a Cadillac.

746
01:13:57,473 --> 01:13:59,862
The salsiccia is wonderful!

747
01:14:00,033 --> 01:14:02,183
Here, have a sandwich.

748
01:14:14,393 --> 01:14:18,227
- Nice to see you, Mr Zasa.
- Have a nice time.

749
01:14:19,153 --> 01:14:22,145
Don't forget to buy your raffle tickets.

750
01:14:24,433 --> 01:14:27,664
- What are you doing?
- He didn't mean it.

751
01:14:27,833 --> 01:14:31,109
- Tell him you're sorry.
- OK, let's go.

752
01:14:48,673 --> 01:14:51,141
Joey! How are you?

753
01:14:51,953 --> 01:14:54,592
How are you, buddy boy?

754
01:14:54,753 --> 01:14:58,382
Hey, Joey Zasa! Joey, up your ass!

755
01:14:59,593 --> 01:15:02,266
- Who is this? Do you know him?
- Ignore him.

756
01:15:02,433 --> 01:15:06,062
Who's going to win the car? The Ant?

757
01:15:07,553 --> 01:15:11,785
This is what gives Italian-Americans
a bad name. A cappone like this.

758
01:15:11,953 --> 01:15:14,183
Joey, up your ass!

759
01:15:14,353 --> 01:15:17,151
Get off the car!
Do you have a raffle ticket?

760
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:21,110
Joey, take a look at my raffle ticket!

761
01:15:22,073 --> 01:15:25,429
Here's what I think of you...
and your raffle ticket.

762
01:15:25,593 --> 01:15:29,108
Get the fuck off this car.
I'll break your fucking balls.

763
01:15:31,593 --> 01:15:34,187
Get out of here!

764
01:15:48,993 --> 01:15:52,224
Run, Joey! You piece of shit!

765
01:16:03,633 --> 01:16:04,952
Open the door!

766
01:16:05,513 --> 01:16:08,266
How are you, Joe?

767
01:16:10,393 --> 01:16:11,712
Zasa!

768
01:16:28,513 --> 01:16:35,191
Don't ever again give that kind of order.
Not while I'm alive.

769
01:16:35,553 --> 01:16:37,350
Understand?

770
01:16:38,473 --> 01:16:44,423
You were too sick to make a decision.
I got a go-ahead from Neri and Connie.

771
01:16:45,193 --> 01:16:46,990
Connie?

772
01:16:55,913 --> 01:16:59,030
It was the right decision, Uncle Mike.

773
01:16:59,193 --> 01:17:02,822
It was the wrong decision.
I command this family!

774
01:17:03,393 --> 01:17:05,463
Right or wrong...

775
01:17:06,193 --> 01:17:09,026
...it was not what I wanted!

776
01:17:26,673 --> 01:17:28,504
Do you understand?

777
01:17:34,833 --> 01:17:36,152
Yes.

778
01:17:42,593 --> 01:17:44,265
Come on, Michael.

779
01:17:55,433 --> 01:17:57,264
Yes.

780
01:17:58,713 --> 01:18:04,470
Good. Vincent, help me to my bed.
I want to talk to you alone for a minute.

781
01:18:12,233 --> 01:18:16,829
You know, I always felt
responsible for you.

782
01:18:16,993 --> 01:18:19,063
You know that.

783
01:18:19,353 --> 01:18:21,105
Your father...

784
01:18:22,033 --> 01:18:25,309
...my brother, we were opposites.

785
01:18:25,473 --> 01:18:30,342
We would fight and argue.
But I never doubted his love.

786
01:18:30,513 --> 01:18:35,143
He would do anything for me.
But his temper...

787
01:18:38,353 --> 01:18:42,426
Too much. It clouded his reason.

788
01:18:43,513 --> 01:18:46,744
I don't want you to make that mistake.

789
01:18:48,793 --> 01:18:51,023
Also...

790
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:54,185
...he, too, had a way with women.

791
01:18:55,393 --> 01:18:57,861
- Vincent...
- So I hear.

792
01:18:58,033 --> 01:19:00,422
What are you doing with my daughter?

793
01:19:02,913 --> 01:19:05,905
What are you doing with her?

794
01:19:09,433 --> 01:19:11,663
It's too dangerous.

795
01:19:14,153 --> 01:19:16,144
Do you hear me?

796
01:19:21,553 --> 01:19:23,544
OK.

797
01:19:36,713 --> 01:19:38,863
Vincenzo...

798
01:19:42,113 --> 01:19:46,903
When they come,
they'll come at what you love.

799
01:19:54,073 --> 01:19:57,224
Michael, you must lead another life.

800
01:19:57,393 --> 01:20:02,626
You have everything a man could
desire. It's time for you to retire.

801
01:20:03,313 --> 01:20:06,146
I have too much responsibility.

802
01:20:06,833 --> 01:20:12,226
Immobiliare? It's too difficult now.
You should really get out.

803
01:20:12,513 --> 01:20:17,303
What do you know
about those pezzi da novanta in Italy?

804
01:20:20,673 --> 01:20:24,382
I'm too old to know anything
about those new people.

805
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:29,104
I must accept my age
and grow my olives and tomatoes.

806
01:20:30,113 --> 01:20:34,345
- We're not that old.
- But you're very ill.

807
01:20:34,833 --> 01:20:39,463
Michael... Let me see
what can be done.

808
01:20:39,633 --> 01:20:43,831
Let me work to make your path
a little easier.

809
01:20:43,993 --> 01:20:49,351
- Your friendship does that always.
- That makes me happy.

810
01:20:49,513 --> 01:20:53,506
Joey Zasa...
You were wrong about him.

811
01:20:54,473 --> 01:20:58,261
I trust too much.
That's always been my fault.

812
01:21:05,433 --> 01:21:09,312
Michael... treachery is everywhere.

813
01:21:09,473 --> 01:21:13,705
You still have your fingers
on the strings, even now.

814
01:21:14,633 --> 01:21:17,625
Let's see more of each other.

815
01:21:17,793 --> 01:21:22,184
- Michael, in Sicily?
- In Sicily.

816
01:21:22,713 --> 01:21:24,704
In Sicilia.

817
01:21:24,953 --> 01:21:27,467
In Sicilia.

818
01:22:12,713 --> 01:22:14,704
How are you?

819
01:22:14,873 --> 01:22:17,341
Don Bendino, my old friend.

820
01:22:47,753 --> 01:22:53,111
I brought you here so that my old friend
and protector, Don Tommasino,

821
01:22:53,273 --> 01:22:55,264
could advise us.

822
01:22:55,433 --> 01:22:59,312
Don Tommasino,
what do you think of Altobello?

823
01:23:01,313 --> 01:23:03,304
A very talented man.

824
01:23:03,473 --> 01:23:08,024
He's kept the peace between
our Sicilian and American friends.

825
01:23:08,193 --> 01:23:10,753
The saint of reason.

826
01:23:12,473 --> 01:23:16,307
A blood-bath in Atlantic City
left New York a mess.

827
01:23:16,473 --> 01:23:19,465
Joey Zasa at least was running
a tight ship,

828
01:23:19,633 --> 01:23:23,387
but with him out of the picture
we must step in.

829
01:23:23,553 --> 01:23:27,865
- Step back in.
- Or the Chinese and Colombians will.

830
01:23:28,033 --> 01:23:33,391
The Corleones didn't do drugs, so New
York is weak and Palermo is strong.

831
01:23:34,273 --> 01:23:38,266
Your enemies always get strong
on what you leave behind.

832
01:23:38,833 --> 01:23:44,988
Don Tommasino, who could give
the order for that massacre...

833
01:23:47,193 --> 01:23:50,868
...and still pressure the Vatican deal?

834
01:23:51,033 --> 01:23:55,788
Only Lucchesi, a man in two worlds.

835
01:23:57,633 --> 01:24:01,512
"Our ships must all sail
in the same direction"...

836
01:24:02,633 --> 01:24:08,151
Italian politics have had these men
for centuries. They are the true Mafia.

837
01:24:08,313 --> 01:24:11,464
The Archbishop and the Vatican Bank,
that's the big problem.

838
01:24:11,633 --> 01:24:15,751
They're the same problem, B.J.
They're connected.

839
01:24:16,273 --> 01:24:18,787
The Archbishop has powerful friends.

840
01:24:21,353 --> 01:24:23,264
They totally protect him.

841
01:24:23,433 --> 01:24:27,665
Is there someone in the Church
who can assist us?

842
01:24:27,833 --> 01:24:31,428
Someone who is honourable?

843
01:24:32,473 --> 01:24:34,464
Cardinal Lamberto.

844
01:24:34,633 --> 01:24:39,832
A good and wise man. Very influential.

845
01:24:39,993 --> 01:24:42,871
He will receive you.

846
01:24:47,673 --> 01:24:53,305
I will see this Cardinal Lamberto
and see if we can work things out.

847
01:24:54,913 --> 01:24:59,623
You honour your agreements,
but you are dealing with crooks.

848
01:25:00,073 --> 01:25:02,541
They have no honour.

849
01:25:04,233 --> 01:25:05,985
My word is final.

850
01:25:16,193 --> 01:25:19,947
Politics and crime,
they're the same thing.

851
01:25:35,393 --> 01:25:38,191
Bravo! Bravo!

852
01:25:41,593 --> 01:25:47,987
I've invited you all here to celebrate
my son's dbut in an opera house...

853
01:25:48,153 --> 01:25:51,145
We'll play "Philadelphia".

854
01:25:51,313 --> 01:25:55,545
Seven cards. Two down, four up.
Deuces and one-eyed jacks are wild.

855
01:25:55,713 --> 01:25:58,273
...in the opera "Cavallaria Rusticana".

856
01:25:58,433 --> 01:26:02,028
- It's "Cavalleria Rusticana", Dad.
- "Cavalleria".

857
01:26:02,193 --> 01:26:07,187
I think I have tickets to the wrong opera.
I've been in New York too long.

858
01:26:08,033 --> 01:26:11,343
You will all receive tickets,
so come on time.

859
01:26:11,513 --> 01:26:14,505
Dad, I've got a present for you.

860
01:26:17,193 --> 01:26:21,630
It comes from the town of Corleone
and it's authentic Sicilian.

861
01:26:22,633 --> 01:26:25,909
And... I learned it for you.

862
01:26:34,673 --> 01:26:37,267
(SINGS SICILIAN LOVE SONG)

863
01:27:51,433 --> 01:27:56,951
She was wonderful, beautiful.
I loved her. And then she died.

864
01:27:58,033 --> 01:28:03,061
My trusted bodyguard
planted a bomb in my car.

865
01:28:04,433 --> 01:28:07,345
She drove it before I did.

866
01:28:07,873 --> 01:28:11,388
Why is such a beautiful country
so violent?

867
01:28:11,553 --> 01:28:12,872
History.

868
01:28:13,033 --> 01:28:17,584
Mom was telling me about when your
biggest worry was passing your exams.

869
01:28:17,753 --> 01:28:21,189
- Yes, it was then.
- I worry about you now.

870
01:28:21,353 --> 01:28:26,347
Oh, Mary, you're such a
warm-hearted girl. You always were.

871
01:28:26,513 --> 01:28:30,267
- I love my family.
- Even your cousin Vincent?

872
01:28:33,713 --> 01:28:35,783
I really love him.

873
01:28:36,913 --> 01:28:41,065
- He's your first cousin.
- Then I love him first.

874
01:28:41,233 --> 01:28:43,952
Mary, you can't see him.

875
01:28:44,433 --> 01:28:47,266
Just don't see him any more.

876
01:28:47,433 --> 01:28:51,108
He's right. It's too dangerous.

877
01:28:52,993 --> 01:28:55,985
Mary, you can't see him any more.

878
01:28:56,153 --> 01:28:58,542
- Not in that fashion.
- No.

879
01:28:59,913 --> 01:29:03,428
- Please, promise me.
- No!

880
01:29:03,593 --> 01:29:05,663
- Obey me on this.
- No, Dad!

881
01:29:10,833 --> 01:29:15,384
Mary is smart, Dad.
She'll understand eventually.

882
01:29:29,753 --> 01:29:32,313
(MUSIC: "MIRACLE MAN"
BY ELVIS COSTELLO)

883
01:29:36,873 --> 01:29:39,865
Bella cugina... Tesoro mio.

884
01:29:50,513 --> 01:29:53,505
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

885
01:29:53,673 --> 01:29:57,188
I want you to do something for me.
It's dangerous.

886
01:29:58,873 --> 01:30:02,229
Good. I'm in. What do you need?

887
01:30:02,393 --> 01:30:05,942
I want you to sell your soul
to Don Altobello.

888
01:30:06,113 --> 01:30:08,547
To betray me.

889
01:30:11,073 --> 01:30:13,826
He'd never believe me.

890
01:30:13,993 --> 01:30:17,110
- That depends.
- Sit down.

891
01:30:19,113 --> 01:30:21,502
I have an idea.

892
01:30:22,113 --> 01:30:26,584
See if you can learn
how high Altobello is connected.

893
01:30:29,433 --> 01:30:31,788
Arrange a meeting.

894
01:30:33,713 --> 01:30:38,628
You say how devoted you are to me.
Tell him your problems.

895
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:42,548
- Ask for his help.
- What problems?

896
01:30:43,873 --> 01:30:47,024
That you want to run away
with my daughter.

897
01:30:47,193 --> 01:30:51,983
But you know that if you do,
I will become your enemy.

898
01:30:55,793 --> 01:30:59,308
- You know that I would never do that.
- I know.

899
01:31:00,313 --> 01:31:05,262
Ask Altobello to speak to me.
To further the marriage.

900
01:31:05,433 --> 01:31:10,791
But you're cousins, after all. Michael
was always a little old-fashioned.

901
01:31:10,953 --> 01:31:15,947
Say you can't belong to my legitimate
world. That you want your own family.

902
01:31:16,553 --> 01:31:20,432
I could straighten out
what Joey Zasa left behind.

903
01:31:21,113 --> 01:31:24,389
I could use your friendship
to persuade him.

904
01:31:24,993 --> 01:31:28,030
I would be indebted to you forever.

905
01:31:29,673 --> 01:31:33,632
A Corleone knows the value
of such a friend.

906
01:31:34,873 --> 01:31:37,262
Then you would work for me?

907
01:31:38,273 --> 01:31:39,547
S.

908
01:31:42,073 --> 01:31:44,746
Bacio la mano, Don Altobello.

909
01:31:47,273 --> 01:31:52,142
If he hints that he wants you
to betray me, get insulted,

910
01:31:52,673 --> 01:31:55,346
because that's his trap.

911
01:32:01,553 --> 01:32:04,943
You're not telling me
the whole truth, Vincenzo.

912
01:32:07,633 --> 01:32:13,310
Isn't it true, that with Michael gone,
the girl controls everything?

913
01:32:16,713 --> 01:32:20,547
- Leave the girl out of this.
- Of course, you love her.

914
01:32:20,713 --> 01:32:23,147
And she loves you.

915
01:32:42,353 --> 01:32:44,992
I guessed it, didn't I?

916
01:32:46,673 --> 01:32:52,031
You're a wise man, Don Altobello.
I'll be learning a lot from you.

917
01:32:52,193 --> 01:32:56,186
The richest man is the one
with the most powerful friends.

918
01:32:57,793 --> 01:33:00,512
It's my duty to make the introductions.

919
01:33:07,313 --> 01:33:09,144
Don Lucchesi.

920
01:33:11,633 --> 01:33:17,185
Don Altobello tells me that you have
a strong character. A man of respect.

921
01:33:17,353 --> 01:33:20,743
This is the hero who put Joey Zasa
in his grave.

922
01:33:20,913 --> 01:33:25,145
If we'd known of his existence,
we wouldn't have backed Joey.

923
01:33:25,313 --> 01:33:27,781
No one wants another Joe.

924
01:33:29,073 --> 01:33:31,667
Let me be your friend.

925
01:33:31,833 --> 01:33:36,145
- Even the strongest man needs friends.
- I'm flattered.

926
01:33:37,113 --> 01:33:41,709
You're a man of finance and politics,
things I don't understand.

927
01:33:43,433 --> 01:33:47,506
You understand guns.
Finance is a gun.

928
01:33:48,033 --> 01:33:52,026
Politics is knowing
when to pull the trigger.

929
01:33:56,153 --> 01:33:58,462
How can I help?

930
01:33:58,633 --> 01:34:00,032
Vieni?

931
01:34:02,873 --> 01:34:08,266
Blessed is the peacemaker,
for he can be called the child of God.

932
01:34:08,433 --> 01:34:11,106
- Tu parli Italiano un poco?
- S.

933
01:34:32,753 --> 01:34:35,506
The wheelchair for Don Tommasino.

934
01:34:43,113 --> 01:34:47,345
I trusted this business arrangement
with the Archbishop. I trusted him.

935
01:34:47,513 --> 01:34:51,267
I was sure his honesty
was beyond a doubt.

936
01:34:51,433 --> 01:34:56,223
But, as you see, I'm now
the victim of a swindle.

937
01:34:56,393 --> 01:35:02,104
He's stalling me. Vast monies have
gone to people in high political places

938
01:35:02,273 --> 01:35:04,946
and the Vatican Bank is the guarantor.

939
01:35:05,113 --> 01:35:10,312
If what you say is true,
there will be a great scandal.

940
01:35:12,233 --> 01:35:16,909
Look at this stone. It has been
in the water for a very long time,

941
01:35:17,073 --> 01:35:21,146
but the water has not penetrated it.

942
01:35:24,793 --> 01:35:26,112
Look...

943
01:35:27,113 --> 01:35:32,062
Perfectly dry. The same thing
has happened to men in Europe.

944
01:35:32,233 --> 01:35:36,624
For centuries they have been
surrounded by Christianity,

945
01:35:36,793 --> 01:35:42,504
but Christ has not penetrated.
Christ doesn't live within them.

946
01:35:46,233 --> 01:35:50,226
- What's happening?
- Could you get me something sweet?

947
01:35:50,393 --> 01:35:53,703
Some orange juice, candy...

948
01:35:57,233 --> 01:36:00,270
I have trouble with diabetes.

949
01:36:02,913 --> 01:36:05,427
My blood sugar goes low.

950
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:07,629
I understand.

951
01:36:29,153 --> 01:36:32,543
It happens sometimes
when I'm under stress.

952
01:36:33,073 --> 01:36:35,303
I understand.

953
01:36:36,393 --> 01:36:40,591
To come to you
on such a delicate matter...

954
01:36:43,033 --> 01:36:47,902
Accusations against your Archbishop.
It was difficult for me.

955
01:36:49,033 --> 01:36:50,910
The mind suffers

956
01:36:51,073 --> 01:36:54,145
and the body cries out.

957
01:36:58,673 --> 01:37:00,629
That's true.

958
01:37:02,753 --> 01:37:06,712
Would you like to make
your confession?

959
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:16,303
Your Eminence, I'm...

960
01:37:18,793 --> 01:37:24,663
It's been so long. I wouldn't...
I wouldn't know where to...

961
01:37:25,513 --> 01:37:27,504
It's been 30 years.

962
01:37:28,513 --> 01:37:31,949
I'd use up too much of your time, I think.

963
01:37:32,673 --> 01:37:35,028
I always have time to save souls.

964
01:37:36,273 --> 01:37:41,188
- Well, I'm beyond redemption.
- No, no...

965
01:37:49,993 --> 01:37:54,271
I hear the confessions
of my own priests here.

966
01:37:54,833 --> 01:37:58,587
Sometimes the desire to confess
is overwhelming,

967
01:37:58,753 --> 01:38:01,506
and we must seize the moment.

968
01:38:05,553 --> 01:38:10,104
What is the point of confessing
if I don't repent?

969
01:38:11,513 --> 01:38:14,903
I hear you are a practical man.

970
01:38:15,073 --> 01:38:17,541
What have you got to lose?

971
01:38:28,273 --> 01:38:30,343
Go on.

972
01:38:36,073 --> 01:38:38,303
I...

973
01:38:38,473 --> 01:38:40,782
...betrayed my wife.

974
01:38:41,833 --> 01:38:44,472
Go on, my son.

975
01:38:48,753 --> 01:38:51,267
I betrayed myself.

976
01:38:53,553 --> 01:38:55,703
I killed men.

977
01:38:58,833 --> 01:39:01,825
And I ordered men to be killed.

978
01:39:02,673 --> 01:39:05,267
Go on, my son. Go on.

979
01:39:10,393 --> 01:39:11,826
It's useless.

980
01:39:13,673 --> 01:39:15,664
Go on, my son.

981
01:39:16,553 --> 01:39:18,862
I killed...

982
01:39:22,833 --> 01:39:25,825
I ordered the death of my brother.

983
01:39:26,393 --> 01:39:28,463
He injured me.

984
01:39:29,633 --> 01:39:32,352
I killed my mother's son.

985
01:39:33,393 --> 01:39:35,748
I killed my father's son.

986
01:39:45,593 --> 01:39:50,348
Your sins are terrible,
and it is just that you suffer.

987
01:39:51,673 --> 01:39:54,824
Your life could be redeemed,

988
01:39:54,993 --> 01:39:59,589
but I know that you don't believe that.
You will not change.

989
01:40:02,833 --> 01:40:04,983
Ego te absolvo,

990
01:40:05,153 --> 01:40:08,384
in nomine Patris et Filiis
et Spiritu Sanctus. Amen.

991
01:40:21,673 --> 01:40:29,671
Pope Paul VI, Supreme Pontiff of the
Catholic Church, died last night at 9:40.

992
01:40:30,193 --> 01:40:34,072
He had been suffering from
bad health for several months.

993
01:40:34,233 --> 01:40:40,229
He was renowned for his intellectual and
spiritual qualities and his compassion.

994
01:40:40,393 --> 01:40:43,510
The loss is a cause
for profound mourning by all of us.

995
01:40:48,873 --> 01:40:50,864
Connie...

996
01:40:51,953 --> 01:40:56,663
All my life I've kept trying
to go up in society.

997
01:40:56,833 --> 01:41:01,270
To where everything higher up
was legal, straight...

998
01:41:01,713 --> 01:41:05,342
But the higher I go,
the more crooked it becomes.

999
01:41:07,513 --> 01:41:10,232
Where the hell does it end?

1000
01:41:18,233 --> 01:41:22,112
They've been killing each other
for centuries here.

1001
01:41:23,033 --> 01:41:27,231
For money, for pride, for family.

1002
01:41:29,993 --> 01:41:34,509
To keep from becoming the slaves
of the rich pezzi da novanta.

1003
01:41:40,673 --> 01:41:43,187
I made confession, Connie.

1004
01:41:43,873 --> 01:41:46,387
I confessed my sins.

1005
01:41:47,353 --> 01:41:52,825
Why? That's not like you. You don't
have to confess your sins to a stranger.

1006
01:41:52,993 --> 01:41:54,665
It was the man.

1007
01:41:55,993 --> 01:41:59,622
He's a good man. A true priest.

1008
01:42:03,233 --> 01:42:05,428
He can change things.

1009
01:42:07,393 --> 01:42:09,384
Michael...

1010
01:42:10,353 --> 01:42:13,982
You know, sometimes I think
of poor Fredo.

1011
01:42:14,993 --> 01:42:18,668
Drowned. It was God's will.

1012
01:42:20,633 --> 01:42:23,067
It was a terrible accident.

1013
01:42:23,993 --> 01:42:26,109
But it's finished.

1014
01:42:30,833 --> 01:42:33,142
Michael, I love you.

1015
01:42:34,873 --> 01:42:37,182
I'll always help you.

1016
01:42:48,513 --> 01:42:50,504
Oh, Connie...

1017
01:43:18,713 --> 01:43:25,232
I'm very honoured, Don Altobello, that
you've come from Palermo to visit me.

1018
01:43:28,593 --> 01:43:33,189
The little kid! He's grown.

1019
01:43:34,273 --> 01:43:35,865
Do the donkey.

1020
01:43:38,033 --> 01:43:40,103
(HE BRAYS)

1021
01:43:52,473 --> 01:43:57,103
It's been some time
since we did business together.

1022
01:43:59,993 --> 01:44:04,384
You are my "ace in the hole",
as we say in America.

1023
01:44:05,273 --> 01:44:11,109
I have a stone in my shoe.
You can remove it.

1024
01:44:17,793 --> 01:44:20,102
Only one stone?

1025
01:44:22,433 --> 01:44:25,664
It's a dangerous job.

1026
01:44:25,833 --> 01:44:28,108
A famous man.

1027
01:44:28,273 --> 01:44:31,390
You will have to take precautions.

1028
01:44:34,273 --> 01:44:39,267
Tell me what you want me to do
and I will tell you my price.

1029
01:44:43,953 --> 01:44:46,342
What bread!

1030
01:44:50,433 --> 01:44:52,424
Olive oil...

1031
01:44:57,473 --> 01:45:01,022
Virgin. Only in Sicily.

1032
01:45:03,433 --> 01:45:04,912
Alla salute!

1033
01:45:05,073 --> 01:45:06,791
To his death.

(TANNO Y ANNOUNCEMENT
IN SICILIAN)

1035
01:45:19,953 --> 01:45:21,625
Kay!

1036
01:45:21,793 --> 01:45:23,863
- Connie!
- How are you?

1037
01:45:24,033 --> 01:45:26,911
Mary, I've missed you.

1038
01:45:27,513 --> 01:45:31,506
- Hello, Michael.
- Mom, look at this.

1039
01:45:34,833 --> 01:45:40,590
- It's too bad Douglas couldn't come.
- I know. He had a very important trial.

1040
01:45:40,753 --> 01:45:43,347
I know he wanted to come.

1041
01:45:43,753 --> 01:45:45,789
- The car is...
- OK.

1042
01:45:47,553 --> 01:45:53,708
- Well, your son is an artist.
- Oh, yes. Thanks to you.

1043
01:45:53,873 --> 01:45:58,424
- What for?
- For making me let him go.

1044
01:45:58,913 --> 01:46:03,748
Well, after all these years,
here I am in Sicily for the first time.

1045
01:46:03,913 --> 01:46:07,144
- I want to get a picture of you together.
- OK.

1046
01:46:08,913 --> 01:46:10,904
Hey, Dad. Smile!

1047
01:46:14,953 --> 01:46:18,662
I see you still have Al Neri. Why?

1048
01:46:18,833 --> 01:46:23,224
I need him. He helps me
get in and out of the car.

1049
01:46:23,393 --> 01:46:27,386
- He carries my briefcase.
- You're still a liar, Michael.

1050
01:46:28,273 --> 01:46:34,143
Let me show you Sicily, the real Sicily.
So you'll understand the family history.

1051
01:46:34,313 --> 01:46:37,385
I think I understand it more than enough.

1052
01:47:26,673 --> 01:47:32,270
Anthony, I have something you made
for me a very long time ago.

1053
01:47:34,113 --> 01:47:37,025
- Might bring you luck.
- Thanks.

1054
01:47:40,513 --> 01:47:43,664
You saved it... I remember.

1055
01:47:47,673 --> 01:47:49,664
Thank you, Dad.

1056
01:47:50,953 --> 01:47:52,466
I'm proud of you.

1057
01:47:53,233 --> 01:47:55,030
Thank you.

1058
01:48:10,233 --> 01:48:12,827
- Are they as good as they look?
- Better.

1059
01:48:12,993 --> 01:48:17,509
They're the best. As long as they are
around, Uncle Michael is safe.

1060
01:48:17,673 --> 01:48:19,982
Goodbye.

1061
01:48:21,833 --> 01:48:25,109
- Tell your father I'll be back for dinner.
- OK.

1062
01:48:25,273 --> 01:48:27,787
- Have fun.
- Tell Tony to wait for me.

1063
01:48:27,953 --> 01:48:29,944
I will.

1064
01:48:31,713 --> 01:48:34,830
Buongiorno, signora. At your service.

1065
01:48:38,953 --> 01:48:42,309
If I see Dad, I'll tell him you left.

1066
01:48:47,193 --> 01:48:50,742
You're the only one left
with my father's strength.

1067
01:48:52,833 --> 01:48:57,111
If anything happens to Michael,
I want you to strike back.

1068
01:48:59,473 --> 01:49:01,191
I'll have everything ready.

1069
01:49:04,713 --> 01:49:07,386
Do you swear?

1070
01:49:13,393 --> 01:49:15,782
I swear to you.

1071
01:49:44,313 --> 01:49:46,543
Here it is.

1072
01:49:47,553 --> 01:49:50,545
The house where my father was born.

1073
01:49:51,073 --> 01:49:56,545
This is where they came to take him
when he was a boy. To kill him.

1074
01:49:59,513 --> 01:50:01,151
Wait...

1075
01:50:01,873 --> 01:50:03,864
Listen to that.

1076
01:50:22,153 --> 01:50:25,065
You know Mary's in love.

1077
01:50:25,433 --> 01:50:27,742
Yes, I know.

With a handsome young Italian man
with dark eyes...

1079
01:50:33,273 --> 01:50:35,389
I won't allow it.

1080
01:50:37,513 --> 01:50:41,188
It's wrong. It's wrong and it's dangerous.

1081
01:50:41,553 --> 01:50:44,226
"Oh, father, my father!"

1082

"Give me time to pray to the Lord."

1083
01:50:47,273 --> 01:50:54,349
When the Baron found out that his
daughter had betrayed her husband...

1084
01:50:54,513 --> 01:50:55,866
"No forgiveness!"

1085
01:50:56,033 --> 01:51:01,107
Her father lifted his sword...
and stabbed her through the heart.

1086
01:51:12,033 --> 01:51:13,910
Honour, huh?

1087
01:51:32,033 --> 01:51:35,025
I remember the time you came
to my parents' house

1088
01:51:35,193 --> 01:51:38,503
and told me about the family business.

1089
01:51:38,673 --> 01:51:44,066
How you'd never have anything
to do with it. You sounded like Tony.

1090
01:51:44,593 --> 01:51:47,585
I was a lot like Tony.

1091
01:51:53,713 --> 01:51:56,591
- I can barely see him... Kay?
- What?

1092
01:51:56,753 --> 01:51:59,062
- Do you mind driving?
- What's wrong?

1093
01:51:59,233 --> 01:52:02,225
My eyes. Sometimes
they're all right, but...

1094
01:52:03,633 --> 01:52:06,352
I have to see Don Tommasino...

1095
01:52:09,353 --> 01:52:11,344
Well...

1096
01:52:11,793 --> 01:52:15,422
- There are no bodyguards today.
- I really snuck away.

1097
01:52:22,273 --> 01:52:26,551
Father, where are you going?
Would you like a ride?

1098
01:52:35,633 --> 01:52:39,421
I know you. You're Mosca
from Montelepre.

1099
01:52:40,593 --> 01:52:44,268
You were an assassin then
and you're an assassin now.

1100
01:52:44,433 --> 01:52:47,630
I know Michael Corleone
is at your house.

1101
01:52:48,073 --> 01:52:50,951
I will pass through the gates with you.

1102
01:53:06,113 --> 01:53:07,705
How are you?

1103
01:53:07,873 --> 01:53:11,866
This is Calo, one of my bodyguards
in the old days.

1104
01:53:16,633 --> 01:53:19,431
- We can wait here.
- You want a drink?

1105
01:53:24,473 --> 01:53:27,465
I spent a lot of time in this room...

1106
01:53:28,313 --> 01:53:30,383
...thinking of you.

1107
01:53:33,473 --> 01:53:36,033
And then you got married.

1108
01:53:39,073 --> 01:53:42,782
- I still thought of you.
- What's in that room?

1109
01:53:46,593 --> 01:53:50,586
This is dangerous for you. This is Sicily.

1110
01:53:52,993 --> 01:53:56,030
- I love this country.
- Why?

1111
01:53:57,713 --> 01:54:03,583
Well, all through history, terrible things
have happened to these people.

1112
01:54:04,233 --> 01:54:06,793
Terrible injustices.

1113
01:54:07,433 --> 01:54:12,461
But they still expect good,
rather than bad, will happen to them.

1114
01:54:12,633 --> 01:54:15,466
Sort of like me and you?

1115
01:54:18,513 --> 01:54:21,903
- How so?
- I'm still here, right?

1116
01:54:22,073 --> 01:54:25,110
We do have a bad history,
but I'm still here.

1117
01:54:25,273 --> 01:54:27,741
Yes, you are, but with dread.

1118
01:54:32,433 --> 01:54:34,071
Give me the order!

1119
01:54:34,553 --> 01:54:38,102
Is that supposed to make me
not dread you?

1120
01:54:39,953 --> 01:54:42,547
We're in Sicily. It's opera.

1121
01:54:44,273 --> 01:54:46,264
OK.

1122
01:54:48,073 --> 01:54:50,382
What do we do now?

1123
01:54:52,833 --> 01:54:57,463
Be reasonable.
Let's try not to hurt each other.

1124
01:55:03,593 --> 01:55:06,312
I want you to forgive me.

1125
01:55:08,593 --> 01:55:11,585
- For what?
- Everything.

1126
01:55:14,833 --> 01:55:17,711
Oh, like God?

1127
01:55:18,393 --> 01:55:21,351
No, I need something a little closer.

1128
01:55:24,073 --> 01:55:27,110
You couldn't understand,
back in those days.

1129
01:55:28,593 --> 01:55:33,223
I loved my father. I swore I would
never be a man like him,

1130
01:55:33,393 --> 01:55:37,466
but I loved him and he was in danger.
What could I do?

1131
01:55:37,633 --> 01:55:40,943
And then later, you were in danger.

1132
01:55:41,113 --> 01:55:44,901
Our children were in danger.
What could I do?

1133
01:55:45,073 --> 01:55:50,511
You were all that I...
Ioved and valued most in the world.

1134
01:55:52,113 --> 01:55:54,673
Now I'm losing you. I lost you.

1135
01:55:55,513 --> 01:55:57,629
You're gone.

1136
01:55:58,593 --> 01:56:02,108
And it was all for nothing. So...

1137
01:56:06,033 --> 01:56:10,948
You have to understand,
I had a whole different destiny planned.

1138
01:56:13,953 --> 01:56:16,513
All right, I'll stop.

1139
01:56:25,953 --> 01:56:29,866
I really don't know what you
want from me, Michael.

1140
01:56:30,033 --> 01:56:34,823
- I mean...
- I'm not the man that you think I am.

1141
01:56:36,113 --> 01:56:40,026
- I don't know.
- I love you, Kay.

1142
01:56:41,273 --> 01:56:43,912
Don't dread me any more.

You know, every night here in Sicily...

1144
01:56:54,513 --> 01:56:59,792
...I dream about my wife
and my children...

1145
01:57:02,913 --> 01:57:05,188
...and how I lost them.

1146
01:57:06,753 --> 01:57:12,271
I guess that if it's any consolation,
I want you to know that...

1147
01:57:15,473 --> 01:57:16,792
...that...

1148
01:57:17,873 --> 01:57:20,512
...I always loved you, Michael.

1149
01:57:21,633 --> 01:57:23,430
And you know...

1150
01:57:24,993 --> 01:57:27,507
...always, I always will.

(RADIO) Frederick Keinszig
known as "God's Banker",

1173
01:59:57,913 --> 01:59:59,505
has been reported missing.

1174
01:59:59,673 --> 02:00:06,112
He was last seen leaving the Rome
offices of Vatican owned lmmobiliare.

1175
02:00:06,793 --> 02:00:10,547
Also missing was a large sum
of money and several documents.

1176

Keinszig, you fool.

1177
02:00:16,633 --> 02:00:21,468
His absence casts further suspicion
on the dealings of the Vatican Bank.

1178

For several years,
the bank and its companies

have been the object of allegations
of disreputable business practices.

Lucchesi, will you please
try to understand?

1181
02:00:34,793 --> 02:00:39,344
I have phoned him.
I have waited here by the phone.

1182
02:00:41,713 --> 02:00:46,150
You would do well to remember,
Mr Lucchesi,

1183
02:00:46,313 --> 02:00:53,025
that this Pope has very different ideas
from the last one.

1184
02:01:13,713 --> 02:01:15,908
Goodbye, my old friend.

1185
02:01:18,193 --> 02:01:21,469
You could have lived a little longer.

1186
02:01:21,633 --> 02:01:24,864
I could be closer to my dream.

1187

You were so loved, Don Tommasino.

and you so loved?

- What guys?
- Lucchesi.

A Sicilian. I don't know his name.

...to keep everything from coming
to this. But it's not possible.

I know how you feel about Michael,
but you can't save him.

He's lost.

1242
02:08:23,673 --> 02:08:25,186
Think of yourself.

1243
02:08:26,553 --> 02:08:29,272
What's your answer, Vincent?

1244
02:08:30,633 --> 02:08:33,227
Enjoy the opera.

You're 80, but don't look more than 60.

02:09:10,433 --> 02:09:12,071
You're the only one who remembered.

1253
02:09:12,473 --> 02:09:17,627
We've just got the word. The Pope has
ratified the lmmobiliare deal. We've won.

1254
02:09:17,793 --> 02:09:19,749
Congratulations.

Strange how things work.

1256
02:09:24,393 --> 02:09:29,183
The Pope is doing what you said
he'd do. He's cleaning house.

1257
02:09:29,353 --> 02:09:33,551
He should be careful.
It's dangerous to be an honest man.

I want to put more muscle backstage

Hi. Where's your leather?

Stop it.

Grazie!

that you can't be part of.

This is from Vincent Corleone!

It's serious. Our man inside the Vatican
says there's a plot against the Pope.

He'll have a heart attack?

We may not be in time to save him.
