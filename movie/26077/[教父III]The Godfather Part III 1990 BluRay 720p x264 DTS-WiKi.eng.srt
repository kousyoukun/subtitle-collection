1
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:56,559

2
00:01:51,524 --> 00:01:53,458
My dear children.

3
00:01:53,993 --> 00:01:59,056
It is now better than several years since I moved to New York

4
00:01:59,165 --> 00:02:02,657
and I haven't seen you as much as I would like to.

5
00:02:03,736 --> 00:02:07,502
I hope you will come to this ceremony of papal honours,

6
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,938
given for my charitable work.

7
00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:12,170

8
00:02:12,312 --> 00:02:15,645
The only wealth in this world is children.

9
00:02:15,748 --> 00:02:18,876
More than all the money and power on earth.

10
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:21,849
You are my treasure.

11
00:02:23,556 --> 00:02:25,922
Anthony and Mary,

12
00:02:26,059 --> 00:02:30,826
although I entrusted your education to your mother for your own best interest,

13
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:33,588
I look forward to seeing you,

14
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,898
and to a new period of harmony in our lives.

15
00:02:38,304 --> 00:02:43,435
perhaps you might prevail upon your mother to come to this celebration,

16
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:49,607
and that from time to time, we can all see each other at family functions.

17
00:02:49,749 --> 00:02:55,779
Anyway, I remain your loving father.

18
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,551
Hail Mary, full of grace...

19
00:03:30,123 --> 00:03:32,091
...blessed art Thou amongst women...

20
00:03:33,526 --> 00:03:36,222
...and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb, Jesus.

21
00:03:37,864 --> 00:03:40,355
Holy Mary, mother of God,

22
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,561
pray for us sinners...

23
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:12,791
Almighty God, bless the insignia of Saint Sebastian the Martyr,

24
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:19,361
that it may contribute to the sacredness of him to whom it is given.

25
00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:35,549
Do you, Michael, promise to be faithful

26
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:38,647
to the noble purposes of this Order,

27
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:43,923
to have a special care for the poor, the needy and those who are ill?

28
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,520
I do so promise.

29
00:05:01,214 --> 00:05:05,708
May the blessing of Almighty God, Father,

30
00:05:05,818 --> 00:05:11,085
Son and Holy Spirit descend upon you

31
00:05:11,224 --> 00:05:14,819
and remain with you forever.

32
00:05:14,994 --> 00:05:16,188

33
00:06:48,287 --> 00:06:50,983
Vincent, our name is not on the list.

34
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:55,356
Write it in. Mancini.

35
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:57,656
M-A-N-C-I-N-I.

36
00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:00,521
Problem?

37
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:01,895
My name isn't on the list.

38
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:05,266
Then you have to leave immediately.

39
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:06,929
You want to dance with me?

40
00:07:07,106 --> 00:07:10,132
Joe, it's Vinnie. These are our guests.

41
00:07:10,243 --> 00:07:12,234
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir.

42
00:07:12,345 --> 00:07:14,438
Welcome to the party.

43
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:09,424
it's good to see you.

44
00:08:09,535 --> 00:08:11,560
Good to see you. This is my husband.

45
00:08:11,671 --> 00:08:14,231
-Sit down.
-My son, Anthony.

46
00:08:15,341 --> 00:08:19,539
The Order of Saint Sebastian is one of the highest honours the Church awards.

47
00:08:19,645 --> 00:08:20,805

48
00:08:20,913 --> 00:08:23,609
it was first granted by Pope...

49
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:26,446
What about Mr Corleone's connections with gambling?

50
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:28,880
The press kits have...

51
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:30,853
And involvement with the underworld?

52
00:08:30,957 --> 00:08:32,652
Cut the crap.

53
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:38,722
The Pope, the Holy Father himself, has today blessed Michael Corleone.

54
00:08:38,831 --> 00:08:40,856
Do you know better than the Pope?

55
00:08:42,034 --> 00:08:43,296
Vincent!

56
00:08:43,402 --> 00:08:45,962
-She loves you.
-Yeah?

57
00:08:50,609 --> 00:08:52,338
I love you too.

58
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,545
Hi, Vincent. I remember you.

59
00:09:02,655 --> 00:09:04,646
From where?

60
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,849
The last party we were at together.

61
00:09:06,993 --> 00:09:08,426
Did you come to the club?

62
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:10,119
No, it was a wedding.

63
00:09:10,229 --> 00:09:11,662

64
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:15,562
I was eight and you were 15.

65
00:09:16,002 --> 00:09:19,028
I had many girifriends when I was 15.

66
00:09:19,105 --> 00:09:20,094
8 year olds?

67
00:09:20,172 --> 00:09:21,696
Especially them.

68
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:25,305
Where's Mary?

69
00:09:25,878 --> 00:09:30,372
Would somebody please hail Mary? Excuse me, Your Excellency.

70
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:35,377
You haven't kissed me hello yet. Relatives always kiss.

71
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:36,818
Now we're related?

72
00:09:36,922 --> 00:09:38,651
I'm your little cousin.

73
00:09:46,465 --> 00:09:48,023
Who's your father?

74
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,603
I'll give you a hint. He's Italian.

75
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:53,865

76
00:09:53,973 --> 00:09:56,134
Mary, we've been waiting for you.

77
00:09:56,275 --> 00:10:00,405
Remember to keep your voice low.

78
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:03,573
And smile. Don't forget to smile.

79
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:27,468
The honorary chairman of the Vito Corleone Foundation:

80
00:10:27,573 --> 00:10:30,064
my daughter, Mary Corleone.

81
00:10:39,752 --> 00:10:42,084
Thanks.

82
00:10:42,521 --> 00:10:46,252
I think I inherited my father's love for speechmaking.

83
00:10:46,358 --> 00:10:47,848
Here it goes.

84
00:10:48,994 --> 00:10:53,624
The Vito Corleone Foundation helps the poor in every country,

85
00:10:53,732 --> 00:10:57,998
gives grants to artists, funds medical research,

86
00:10:58,137 --> 00:11:02,972
and is particularly dedicated to the resurrection of Sicily.

87
00:11:03,476 --> 00:11:05,535
Archbishop Gilday,

88
00:11:05,644 --> 00:11:08,636
here is 100 million dollars

89
00:11:08,747 --> 00:11:10,237
for the poor of Sicily,

90
00:11:10,349 --> 00:11:12,078
in the name of Vito Corleone.

91
00:11:12,685 --> 00:11:14,778
Don't spend it all in one place.

92
00:11:33,072 --> 00:11:38,806
Mary, I'm so proud of you.

93
00:11:45,284 --> 00:11:46,478
Michael...

94
00:11:47,052 --> 00:11:49,714
You've done a wonderful thing for Sicily.

95
00:11:50,656 --> 00:11:54,285
Let's hope that the money gets to the people who need it.

96
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,891
Amen.

97
00:11:55,995 --> 00:11:58,020
...the most important part:

98
00:11:58,764 --> 00:12:01,232
Johnny Fontane!

99
00:12:09,642 --> 00:12:11,405
Thank you very much.

100
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,274
I'm happy to be here. I would like you to join me

101
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,976
in honouring Commendatore Michael Corleone.

102
00:12:22,788 --> 00:12:26,121
I have something special for our godfather.

103
00:12:26,225 --> 00:12:28,591
I happen to know his favourite song.

104
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:29,716
Michael, where are you going?

105
00:12:29,828 --> 00:12:31,193

106
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:34,357
I'm off to the kitchen to hear some Tony Bennett records.

107
00:12:35,901 --> 00:12:38,392
Your favourite song: "Salsiccia's Own".

108
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:41,371
I'm having a salsiccia sandwich. I'll be back.

109
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:51,582

110
00:12:51,684 --> 00:12:57,520

111
00:12:57,623 --> 00:13:04,051

112
00:13:04,597 --> 00:13:08,590

113
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:17,437
Hello, kay.

114
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,378
Congratulations, Michael. That's quite an honour.

115
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,015
But a little expensive, wouldn't you say?

116
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,260
Cake?

117
00:13:38,764 --> 00:13:40,391
No, thank you.

118
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:57,007
-it's been a long time, hasn't it?
-Yeah.

119
00:13:57,116 --> 00:13:59,414
-Eight years.
-Yeah.

120
00:13:59,752 --> 00:14:02,050
You look wonderful.

121
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:07,715
Your son has something he wants to talk to you about.

122
00:14:07,826 --> 00:14:09,589
I came here for him.

123
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:25,308

124
00:14:25,411 --> 00:14:30,849

125
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:35,283

126
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:45,786
What's wrong with being a lawyer?

127
00:14:45,898 --> 00:14:47,729

128
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:51,132
He wants his life to be in music.

129
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:54,097
Music is great, I love music.

130
00:14:54,206 --> 00:14:56,299
But he should finish what he started.

131
00:14:56,408 --> 00:14:57,932
Anthony...

132
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,800
I'm going my own way.

133
00:14:59,912 --> 00:15:01,345
Your own way?

134
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:03,112
-Professional singer?
-Yes.

135
00:15:03,782 --> 00:15:06,808
What happens if you fail?

136
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:08,682
I won't fail.

137
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:10,288
Men always believe that.

138
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:11,345

139
00:15:11,423 --> 00:15:15,154
A law degree is like taking out insurance.

140
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,659
After that you can...

141
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:19,424
-work for me...
-I will never work for you.

142
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:22,391
I have bad memories.

143
00:15:24,002 --> 00:15:27,631
Every family has bad memories.

144
00:15:30,442 --> 00:15:32,501
I'll always be your son,

145
00:15:32,611 --> 00:15:35,876
but won't have anything to do with your business.

146
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:41,716
Anthony... finish the law degree.

147
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:43,912
No.

148
00:16:01,073 --> 00:16:06,409
Well, that he got from you. That "no".

149
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,279
You could've helped me convince him.

150
00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:13,815
Convince him of what?

151
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:15,250
Of what?

152
00:16:15,854 --> 00:16:18,584
He throws his life away.

153
00:16:18,757 --> 00:16:21,351
He throws greatness away.

154
00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:23,561
This is greatness?

155
00:16:24,763 --> 00:16:28,096
Now that you're so respectable, you're more dangerous than ever.

156
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:34,604
I preferred you when you were just a common Mafia hood.

157
00:16:34,706 --> 00:16:39,700
-Can we talk common sense here?
-All right.

158
00:16:39,812 --> 00:16:41,006
Okay.

159
00:16:47,352 --> 00:16:49,912
Tony knows that you killed Fredo.

160
00:16:56,628 --> 00:16:57,925
What did you come here for?

161
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,055
To protect my son.

162
00:17:00,165 --> 00:17:02,759
Not to see you disguised by your church.

163
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:05,928
That was a shameful ceremony.

164
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:12,634
I spent my life protecting my son.

165
00:17:12,744 --> 00:17:16,441
I spent my life protecting my family!

166
00:17:16,548 --> 00:17:18,846
Let's be reasonable, okay?

167
00:17:19,618 --> 00:17:23,019
That's your big thing, isn't it, Michael?

168
00:17:23,222 --> 00:17:27,989
Reason. Backed up by murder.

169
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:33,089
Oh, God. You hate me. You hate me.

170
00:17:33,198 --> 00:17:36,065
No. I don't hate you.

171
00:17:37,603 --> 00:17:39,969
I dread you.

172
00:17:43,108 --> 00:17:44,268
I did what I could, kay,

173
00:17:44,443 --> 00:17:47,879
to protect all of you

174
00:17:48,013 --> 00:17:50,573
from the horrors of this world.

175
00:17:50,682 --> 00:17:53,549
But you became my horror.

176
00:18:02,628 --> 00:18:07,065
The children still love you, though. Especially Mary.

177
00:18:09,034 --> 00:18:15,735
That's something. We can build on that.

178
00:18:15,874 --> 00:18:17,739
For their sake.

179
00:18:20,812 --> 00:18:22,643
Let's try.

180
00:18:22,748 --> 00:18:26,582
Only if you let Tony go free to have his own life,

181
00:18:26,985 --> 00:18:28,953
away from you.

182
00:18:35,427 --> 00:18:37,588
I'll let Tony go.

183
00:18:39,831 --> 00:18:41,526
Thank you.

184
00:19:15,934 --> 00:19:17,959
-Hi.
-Hi.

185
00:19:20,005 --> 00:19:22,803
You could hurt somebody with those.

186
00:19:23,308 --> 00:19:25,333
Let me show you around.

187
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:27,878
Can you get me an interview with Corleone?

188
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,974
No. I'm a relative, but I can't do that. What else can I do for you?

189
00:19:33,685 --> 00:19:35,209
Handsome, but useless.

190
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,617
Oh, yeah?

191
00:19:36,722 --> 00:19:37,984
That's okay, I'll gamble.

192
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,991
Do you like to gamble? Let's go to Atlantic City.

193
00:19:41,093 --> 00:19:43,493
I'll show you how to gamble.

194
00:19:43,595 --> 00:19:46,325
How do I know what numbers to bet?

195
00:19:46,431 --> 00:19:48,422
Do I look like a loser?

196
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:55,063
Well... Spooky-looking guy there.

197
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:58,199
What's a guy like that doing here?

198
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,800
That's Joey Zasa's bulldog.

199
00:19:59,878 --> 00:20:00,867
You know him?

200
00:20:00,946 --> 00:20:02,470
Yeah, I do.

201
00:20:02,948 --> 00:20:05,781
His name is Anthony Squigilaro.

202
00:20:05,884 --> 00:20:07,647
They call him "The Ant".

203
00:20:07,986 --> 00:20:10,784
He dips his bullets in cyanide.

204
00:20:19,297 --> 00:20:21,162
Don Altobello.

205
00:20:22,534 --> 00:20:25,059
I've come to pay my respects.

206
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,694
Grazie.

207
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:31,707
You honour my father's friendship.

208
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,678
Where is my goddaughter?

209
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:38,645
-Constanza!
-Don Altobello.

210
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:43,844
it was not so long ago that I held you in these old hands.

211
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:47,089

212
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:48,556

213
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,458

214
00:20:51,563 --> 00:20:56,899
Michael, I've lost all the venom, all the juice of youth.

215
00:20:57,002 --> 00:21:00,028
I've lost the lust for women,

216
00:21:00,138 --> 00:21:02,663
and now my mind is clear.

217
00:21:02,774 --> 00:21:05,800
My duty to God is clear.

218
00:21:05,911 --> 00:21:10,075
I have a special favour to ask of you.

219
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:18,146
Can I attach my name to the Vito Corleone Foundation,

220
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:24,490
so that you and I can be joined in name and spirit?

221
00:21:25,864 --> 00:21:27,957
-One million dollars.
-Oh, my!

222
00:21:33,605 --> 00:21:34,765
Godfather.

223
00:21:34,873 --> 00:21:37,808
Don Altobello, you have such a heart.

224
00:21:40,645 --> 00:21:45,480
Come, let's go and sample some of that old vino.

225
00:21:51,656 --> 00:21:55,057
The Vatican knows nothing about these shareholders.

226
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,320
Good.

227
00:21:56,428 --> 00:21:58,521
I have a tendency to worry.

228
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:02,464
We've increased our position substantially. Naturally, I worry.

229
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:06,935
Stop worrying, we have an agreement.

230
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:09,939
Good. How do you think I got this grey hair?

231
00:22:10,075 --> 00:22:13,476
Two seconds...

232
00:22:13,578 --> 00:22:15,944
Thank you for your contribution to the swimming-pool.

233
00:22:16,047 --> 00:22:20,211
We need your help on Sam Wallace's candidacy for judgeship.

234
00:22:20,318 --> 00:22:22,752
-We can always use a good judge.
-Thanks.

235
00:22:22,854 --> 00:22:24,287
Andrew!

236
00:22:24,723 --> 00:22:28,819
My godson Andrew Hagen. My brother Tom's eldest boy.

237
00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:33,193
He's been assistant to Bishop Breelan for three years.

238
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:35,129
Hopes to be assigned to the Vatican.

239
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:37,667
Rome needs fine young priests.

240
00:22:37,769 --> 00:22:41,227
His mother Theresa Hagen, Bishop Gilday.

241
00:22:41,706 --> 00:22:43,367
Honoured to meet you.

242
00:22:43,475 --> 00:22:46,273
Mr Corleone. Hi. Grace Hamiiton.

243
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:50,073
Vincent Mancini promised to tell you about me.

244
00:22:50,182 --> 00:22:51,706
That maybe you'd see me.

245
00:22:52,384 --> 00:22:55,751
-Did Vincent Mancini call about her?
-No.

246
00:22:55,887 --> 00:22:58,048
You promised to stay out there,

247
00:22:58,123 --> 00:22:59,112
-I know.
-twice.

248
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:03,050
Joey Zasa showed up.

249
00:23:03,161 --> 00:23:04,958
He's waiting in the lobby.

250
00:23:05,063 --> 00:23:09,466
He wants to personally congratulate you. Show his respect.

251
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,160
Do I have to see him?

252
00:23:11,303 --> 00:23:12,930
He says you're his patron.

253
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:15,029

254
00:23:17,943 --> 00:23:21,743
Hey, Vinnie! Who's your favourite aunt?

255
00:23:21,847 --> 00:23:23,109
You are.

256
00:23:26,251 --> 00:23:29,220
Today I'll talk to Michael about your little problem.

257
00:23:30,422 --> 00:23:34,153
if you'd warned me, I would have worn a better suit.

258
00:23:35,327 --> 00:23:41,391
The Meucci Association has elected you Italian-American Man of the Year.

259
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:44,529
Meucci...

260
00:23:46,972 --> 00:23:48,667
Who's Meucci?

261
00:23:49,774 --> 00:23:52,242
The Italian-American who invented the telephone,

262
00:23:52,344 --> 00:23:55,905
one year before Bell.

263
00:23:59,784 --> 00:24:03,584
And this is the reason you've come today?

264
00:24:05,156 --> 00:24:07,181

265
00:24:10,061 --> 00:24:18,059
I... I've got a stone in my shoe.

266
00:24:18,236 --> 00:24:21,364
A two-bit punk who works for me.

267
00:24:21,506 --> 00:24:26,170
The one who thinks he's related to you.

268
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,577
A bastard.

269
00:24:32,651 --> 00:24:33,913
He's here.

270
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:38,080
Vincent Mancini. He's at the party.

271
00:24:40,358 --> 00:24:42,258
Bring him in.

272
00:24:43,361 --> 00:24:46,626
I think it's good that we talk.

273
00:24:46,731 --> 00:24:49,291
No, grazie.

274
00:24:50,568 --> 00:24:52,502
I have a problem...

275
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:57,600
...and I want to find out if it is my problem

276
00:24:57,943 --> 00:24:59,410
or your problem.

277
00:24:59,544 --> 00:25:01,307
Your business is your business.

278
00:25:01,413 --> 00:25:03,881
I have no interests or percentages from it.

279
00:25:03,982 --> 00:25:05,472

280
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,283
Good.

281
00:25:08,153 --> 00:25:09,848
Then it's my problem.

282
00:25:13,391 --> 00:25:16,690
Michael, you know Vincent Mancini.

283
00:25:16,795 --> 00:25:18,319
Sonny's boy.

284
00:25:19,931 --> 00:25:21,728
How are you, Mr Corleone?

285
00:25:22,067 --> 00:25:23,091
How are you?

286
00:25:23,168 --> 00:25:24,328
Good. How are you?

287
00:25:24,436 --> 00:25:26,131
Good party.

288
00:25:26,204 --> 00:25:27,193
You like it?

289
00:25:27,272 --> 00:25:28,671
Yes, I had to sneak in.

290
00:25:28,773 --> 00:25:30,297
You're dressed for it.

291
00:25:34,879 --> 00:25:39,714
So, what's the trouble between you and Mr Joe Zasa?

292
00:25:41,086 --> 00:25:43,281
Just trouble. I'll take care of it.

293
00:25:44,255 --> 00:25:45,483
That's foolish of you.

294
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,217
Foolish of me?

295
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:49,589
it's a little foolish of this guy, don't you think?

296
00:25:49,694 --> 00:25:51,184
Right?

297
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,927
Right?!

298
00:25:54,232 --> 00:25:56,029
Temper like his father...

299
00:25:56,134 --> 00:26:01,367
Vincent... Mr Joe Zasa now owns

300
00:26:01,473 --> 00:26:05,000
what used to be the Corleone business in New York.

301
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:09,012
Out of kindness, he gave you a job in his family.

302
00:26:09,114 --> 00:26:11,912
You took it against my advice.

303
00:26:12,017 --> 00:26:15,544
I offered you something better in the legitimate world.

304
00:26:15,653 --> 00:26:17,120
You turned me down.

305
00:26:17,222 --> 00:26:21,158
Now you both come to me with this bad blood.

306
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:23,193
What do you expect me to do?

307
00:26:24,229 --> 00:26:25,389
Am I a gangster?

308
00:26:25,497 --> 00:26:26,486
No...

309
00:26:26,598 --> 00:26:28,190
That was Papa's neighbourhood.

310
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:30,392
Zasa runs it like a disgrace!

311
00:26:30,502 --> 00:26:32,333
That's the past, Connie.

312
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:35,065
I earned that territory.

313
00:26:35,173 --> 00:26:38,904
The Commission gave it to me and you approved.

314
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,068
Yes.

315
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:41,338

316
00:26:41,446 --> 00:26:42,936
I came for the party, not to ask for help.

317
00:26:43,048 --> 00:26:44,140
I could kill this bastard.

318
00:26:44,215 --> 00:26:45,204

319
00:26:45,283 --> 00:26:46,978
So kill him.

320
00:26:47,886 --> 00:26:50,946
What does all this have to do with me?

321
00:26:51,056 --> 00:26:53,581
Well, he goes behind your back, saying "Fuck Michael Corleone".

322
00:26:53,758 --> 00:26:56,283

323
00:26:56,394 --> 00:26:59,955
Say it to his face, one time!

324
00:27:00,632 --> 00:27:03,601
Mr Corleone, all bastards are liars.

325
00:27:03,701 --> 00:27:05,532
Shakespeare wrote poems about it.

326
00:27:05,637 --> 00:27:06,899
What am I going to do with this guy?!

327
00:27:07,005 --> 00:27:08,802

328
00:27:15,046 --> 00:27:16,843
Joey,

329
00:27:16,948 --> 00:27:19,974
if there's some guy running around this city,

330
00:27:20,085 --> 00:27:23,111
saying "Fuck Michael Corleone"...

331
00:27:23,955 --> 00:27:28,483
...what do we do with a piece of shit like that?

332
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:32,052
He's a fucking dog.

333
00:27:38,603 --> 00:27:43,734
Yes, it's true. if anyone would say such a thing, they would not be a friend,

334
00:27:43,842 --> 00:27:45,776
they would be a dog.

335
00:27:51,883 --> 00:27:54,215
My interests don't conflict with his.

336
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:57,914
You don't know how much they do.

337
00:27:58,089 --> 00:27:59,522
Quiet, Vincent.

338
00:27:59,691 --> 00:28:01,955
He needs your support!

339
00:28:02,127 --> 00:28:04,857
Don't let me work for this guy, let me work for you.

340
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:05,953

341
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,657
As what? Tough guy?

342
00:28:07,765 --> 00:28:11,963
I don't need tough guys. I need more lawyers.

343
00:28:14,272 --> 00:28:17,002
Since we have no conflicts or debts,

344
00:28:17,108 --> 00:28:22,102
I accept your tribute. I wish you well.

345
00:28:22,213 --> 00:28:26,877
Vincent, make your peace with Mr Joe Zasa.

346
00:28:30,088 --> 00:28:31,521
Go on.

347
00:28:37,662 --> 00:28:39,926
Bastardo...

348
00:28:43,935 --> 00:28:45,493
Vinnie,

349
00:28:45,603 --> 00:28:47,628
what's the matter with you?!

350
00:28:47,939 --> 00:28:49,463
Get him out of here.

351
00:28:51,276 --> 00:28:53,471
Jesus Christ...

352
00:28:54,145 --> 00:28:56,613
I told Connie this wasn't the right time.

353
00:28:56,714 --> 00:28:58,147
Close it.

354
00:28:58,249 --> 00:28:59,477
I know you're into Wall Street,

355
00:28:59,584 --> 00:29:01,882
but you're still the final word.

356
00:29:01,986 --> 00:29:04,921
I want to protect you from these guys. Your lawyers can't.

357
00:29:05,023 --> 00:29:07,389
-But you can?
-Yeah, I can do that.

358
00:29:09,327 --> 00:29:11,352
Why should I be afraid of Zasa?

359
00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:13,724
You stop him from rising in the Commission.

360
00:29:14,866 --> 00:29:18,131
I say we make him dead. Give me the order, I'll do it.

361
00:29:18,236 --> 00:29:21,569
-You'll do it?
-Yeah.

362
00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:28,340
Maybe you should come with me for a few weeks.

363
00:29:28,446 --> 00:29:29,538
See what happens.

364
00:29:29,614 --> 00:29:30,603
Okay.

365
00:29:30,682 --> 00:29:32,206
See if you learn.

366
00:29:33,885 --> 00:29:37,514
And we'll talk about your future.

367
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:39,518
I won't let you down.

368
00:29:46,531 --> 00:29:48,226
it's about ready.

369
00:29:54,172 --> 00:29:55,469
What happened?

370
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,803
if I'm in a room with Zasa, what happens?

371
00:29:58,876 --> 00:29:59,900
I bit his ear off.

372
00:29:59,978 --> 00:30:02,173
Here we go. Watch the card.

373
00:30:05,183 --> 00:30:08,311
Hold it!

374
00:30:08,486 --> 00:30:10,750
-Vincent...
-Yeah.

375
00:30:10,855 --> 00:30:12,982
Take the picture with us.

376
00:30:20,265 --> 00:30:22,130
Nice jacket.

377
00:30:24,002 --> 00:30:26,129
Closer to the centre, sir.

378
00:30:26,237 --> 00:30:28,398

379
00:30:28,506 --> 00:30:29,495

380
00:30:29,607 --> 00:30:31,199
Smile!

381
00:30:31,809 --> 00:30:33,401

382
00:30:34,178 --> 00:30:35,941

383
00:30:48,626 --> 00:30:50,856

384
00:30:50,962 --> 00:30:54,898
Godfather, this is the cake for you and your family from Enzo the baker.

385
00:30:54,999 --> 00:30:56,694

386
00:30:56,801 --> 00:30:58,325
Do you want to do it?

387
00:31:03,975 --> 00:31:05,465

388
00:31:43,748 --> 00:31:47,206
Cent'anni! Cent'anni!

389
00:32:47,345 --> 00:32:48,676
Vincent?

390
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,805
What do you want, sweetheart?

391
00:32:52,517 --> 00:32:54,178
Do you love me?

392
00:32:55,686 --> 00:32:56,778
Come on, go to bed.

393
00:32:56,888 --> 00:32:59,083
Come on, say it.

394
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,886
I love you.

395
00:33:02,026 --> 00:33:05,154
I love you, too.

396
00:33:07,165 --> 00:33:08,928
You've got a cat?

397
00:33:15,606 --> 00:33:17,267
Go get us some water, I'm thirsty.

398
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:21,311
Come on. Come on.

399
00:33:28,486 --> 00:33:31,751
Well, I guess I know my place.

400
00:33:32,223 --> 00:33:35,317
I can't believe I'm actually doing this.

401
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,757
"Get me water, bake me a cake"...

402
00:33:37,862 --> 00:33:40,296
What happened to "please"?

403
00:34:27,011 --> 00:34:30,811
Good boy, Sackface. Go for a walk.

404
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,621
Let her go.

405
00:34:40,725 --> 00:34:42,590
Cut her throat, man.

406
00:34:43,027 --> 00:34:46,019
What did you say?

407
00:34:46,163 --> 00:34:48,028
Cut her fucking throat.

408
00:34:50,935 --> 00:34:52,300
Okay, chief...

409
00:34:52,403 --> 00:34:54,234
Drop your gun or he'll cut her throat.

410
00:34:54,338 --> 00:34:56,203
I hardly know her,

411
00:34:56,307 --> 00:34:58,502
so cut her. What the fuck do I care?

412
00:35:00,545 --> 00:35:04,208
You've got no choice. She'll be dead.

413
00:35:04,315 --> 00:35:06,476
if you do, I'll kill you both.

414
00:35:06,717 --> 00:35:08,207
Give up that knife, I'll let you go.

415
00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:10,617
Cut her throat! Right now!

416
00:35:10,955 --> 00:35:11,944

417
00:35:12,023 --> 00:35:13,684
I'll do something that'll convince you.

418
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:16,157
Don't get frightened. Just watch me.

419
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,318

420
00:35:17,428 --> 00:35:18,861

421
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,500
Oh, shit!

422
00:35:25,603 --> 00:35:28,367
Drop the knife. Drop it!

423
00:35:28,472 --> 00:35:31,600
Good boy. Sit down, I want to talk to you.

424
00:35:31,943 --> 00:35:34,173
it was a wise choice. Sit down.

425
00:35:35,112 --> 00:35:36,943
Lose the mask.

426
00:35:39,951 --> 00:35:42,146
Relax, have a smoke. You smoke?

427
00:35:45,056 --> 00:35:46,614
Whose idea was this?

428
00:35:46,724 --> 00:35:50,660
Who sent you? Tell me who sent you.

429
00:35:53,464 --> 00:35:54,624
No one.

430
00:35:54,732 --> 00:35:56,324
Did you take a look at this guy?

431
00:35:56,434 --> 00:35:57,662
Yeah.

432
00:35:57,768 --> 00:35:59,395
Who sent you?

433
00:36:01,505 --> 00:36:03,871
it was Joey Zasa.

434
00:36:04,075 --> 00:36:05,440

435
00:36:18,255 --> 00:36:20,018
Are you okay?

436
00:36:22,994 --> 00:36:24,791
You were going to let them kill me!

437
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:26,191
No, I wasn't...

438
00:36:26,297 --> 00:36:29,528
You pig! You sick fuck!

439
00:36:31,035 --> 00:36:33,560
You wanted gambling. That's gambling.

440
00:36:33,671 --> 00:36:35,298
Call the police.

441
00:36:38,876 --> 00:36:41,208
You killed the other guy too?

442
00:36:41,312 --> 00:36:45,806
He went for my gun. it was self-defence.

443
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:47,941
Go ahead, call the police.

444
00:36:48,052 --> 00:36:49,280
No, no...

445
00:36:49,387 --> 00:36:51,355
-I'm taking pictures.
-No pictures.

446
00:36:52,623 --> 00:36:53,783

447
00:36:53,891 --> 00:36:55,324
You had a gun!

448
00:36:55,426 --> 00:36:57,257
They only had a knife.

449
00:36:57,361 --> 00:37:00,922
You could have handed them over to the police.

450
00:37:01,098 --> 00:37:04,761
Zasa sent them. I just sent him a message.

451
00:37:05,336 --> 00:37:06,860
Now he has to send you one back.

452
00:37:06,971 --> 00:37:10,600
Is Zasa going to send me one back?

453
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:13,734
He did the right thing. He got Zasa's name!

454
00:37:14,011 --> 00:37:19,711
What has Joey Zasa to do with anything? Joey Zasa is a pazzo.

455
00:37:21,085 --> 00:37:24,213
All right. You are what you are.

456
00:37:24,321 --> 00:37:29,224
It's your nature. Stay close to me. Don't do anything.

457
00:37:29,326 --> 00:37:31,817
keep your mouth shut and your eyes open.

458
00:37:32,063 --> 00:37:34,463
-And you do what I tell you.
-I understand.

459
00:37:34,565 --> 00:37:37,796
-I have problems with the Commission.
-I know.

460
00:37:37,902 --> 00:37:39,995
You don't make them easier.

461
00:37:40,104 --> 00:37:43,403
it wasn't my idea that this happened.

462
00:37:43,674 --> 00:37:45,266
Get out of here.

463
00:37:45,376 --> 00:37:46,775
Michael...

464
00:37:46,877 --> 00:37:48,640
Yes?

465
00:37:49,613 --> 00:37:51,478
Now they'll fear you.

466
00:37:52,049 --> 00:37:53,914
Maybe they should fear you.

467
00:37:58,189 --> 00:37:59,281
B.J., what's up?

468
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,324
The Archbishop just called back.

469
00:38:01,425 --> 00:38:03,791
We've arranged some amazing things.

470
00:38:04,028 --> 00:38:08,465
The publicity is phenomenal. You're the new Rockefeller. A philanthropist.

471
00:38:10,668 --> 00:38:11,896
Sign here, please.

472
00:38:12,002 --> 00:38:14,402
Times do change, don't they?

473
00:38:14,572 --> 00:38:17,666
My father hated foundations.

474
00:38:17,775 --> 00:38:19,970
He loved doing it by himself.

475
00:38:20,277 --> 00:38:23,110
Man to man. But we're different.

476
00:38:23,214 --> 00:38:26,047
No different than any large corporation.

477
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,516
We control a lot of money with little.

478
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:33,682
Minimise taxes. With no government control.

479
00:38:36,794 --> 00:38:38,352

480
00:38:40,164 --> 00:38:41,597

481
00:38:41,866 --> 00:38:43,458
Godfather.

482
00:38:43,634 --> 00:38:45,363
Andrew.

483
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:48,839
Off to Rome...

484
00:38:48,973 --> 00:38:51,441
I wanted to thank you for everything.

485
00:38:51,876 --> 00:38:55,073
-Do you want some breakfast?
-Thanks, I can't.

486
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:56,840
How's your Italian?

487
00:39:00,451 --> 00:39:02,817
-His father was a great lawyer.
-I know.

488
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,388
Didn't live to see him ordained. I did.

489
00:39:05,523 --> 00:39:06,717
Did you ever see one of those?

490
00:39:07,825 --> 00:39:10,988
Beautiful. I was so proud. Let me walk you out.

491
00:39:12,463 --> 00:39:14,431
if you hear any rumours in the Vatican,

492
00:39:14,532 --> 00:39:18,491
-let me know.
-No, Andrew has the true faith.

493
00:39:27,478 --> 00:39:31,414
Don Corleone, I need your help.

494
00:39:31,582 --> 00:39:34,676
And not just to light a little candle.

495
00:39:35,386 --> 00:39:43,088
My gift was to be able to persuade people to give to the Holy Church.

496
00:39:43,194 --> 00:39:48,632
Then Rome decides to put me in charge of the Vatican Bank...

497
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,128
...but I was never a true banker.

498
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:01,103
Mea culpa. I trusted my friends.

499
00:40:01,545 --> 00:40:03,479
Friendship and money...

500
00:40:04,582 --> 00:40:08,313
-Oil and water...
-Indeed.

501
00:40:08,485 --> 00:40:11,386
But these "friends"

502
00:40:11,488 --> 00:40:16,391
used the good name of the Church to feed their greed.

503
00:40:16,493 --> 00:40:19,587
if money was lost...

504
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:22,658
...then I am to blame.

505
00:40:24,702 --> 00:40:30,231
if only prayer could pay off our 700 million dollar deficit.

506
00:40:30,975 --> 00:40:33,500
769 million...

507
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:43,446
The Church owns 25 percent of a large corporation:

508
00:40:43,587 --> 00:40:45,350
Immobiliare.

509
00:40:45,456 --> 00:40:47,219
You know the one I mean?

510
00:40:47,691 --> 00:40:49,124
Largest landlord on Earth.

511
00:40:49,226 --> 00:40:52,753
Real estate worth six billion dollars.

512
00:40:54,732 --> 00:40:57,030
That's true.

513
00:40:57,201 --> 00:40:59,692
And the Vatican vote is necessary

514
00:40:59,803 --> 00:41:01,395
for control.

515
00:41:03,474 --> 00:41:06,602
No, you're mistaken.

516
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,440
This isn't a question of one person deciding.

517
00:41:09,546 --> 00:41:11,104
One deciding vote.

518
00:41:11,215 --> 00:41:13,479
This is like any other company.

519
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:15,017
We have directors

520
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,952
and very old rules.

521
00:41:18,088 --> 00:41:23,788
The Pope himself would have to approve you.

522
00:41:27,031 --> 00:41:30,489
We've sold the casinos.

523
00:41:30,768 --> 00:41:34,602
All businesses having to do with gambling.

524
00:41:34,705 --> 00:41:38,334
We have no interests or investments

525
00:41:38,442 --> 00:41:41,411
in anything illegitimate.

526
00:41:43,514 --> 00:41:45,345
The Corleones are prepared to deposit

527
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:48,043
500 million dollars in the Vatican Bank

528
00:41:48,152 --> 00:41:49,449
when Mr Corleone

529
00:41:49,553 --> 00:41:51,885
receives majority control of Immobiliare.

530
00:41:51,989 --> 00:41:54,753
Immobiliare could be something new.

531
00:41:54,858 --> 00:41:58,191
A European conglomerate.

532
00:41:58,362 --> 00:42:03,265
Few families have control of such a company.

533
00:42:05,936 --> 00:42:08,803
it seems that, in today's world,

534
00:42:08,906 --> 00:42:10,771
the power to absolve debt is greater

535
00:42:10,908 --> 00:42:14,503
than the power of forgiveness.

536
00:42:15,412 --> 00:42:18,404
600 million dollars.

537
00:42:22,286 --> 00:42:26,689
Don't overestimate the power of forgiveness.

538
00:42:27,658 --> 00:42:29,592
Don Corleone,

539
00:42:29,693 --> 00:42:34,926
this deal with Immobiliare can make you one of the richest men in the world.

540
00:42:35,032 --> 00:42:41,460
Your whole past history, and the history of your family, would be washed away.

541
00:42:44,441 --> 00:42:47,137
600 million.

542
00:43:02,259 --> 00:43:04,750
The motion under discussion relates to

543
00:43:04,895 --> 00:43:07,125
Corleone Group's proposal

544
00:43:07,264 --> 00:43:13,203
to acquire 100,000,000 newly issued Class A voting shares.

545
00:43:14,538 --> 00:43:21,341
... Corleone capital invested directly into International Immobiliare,

546
00:43:21,445 --> 00:43:25,245
an old and respected European company.

547
00:43:25,682 --> 00:43:28,708
Mr Corleone's ambitious programme

548
00:43:28,819 --> 00:43:32,983
to expand this real estate company into an international conglomerate...

549
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:35,183
IMMOBILIARE TAKEOVER LIKELY STOCK SOARS

550
00:43:37,594 --> 00:43:40,256
...by Eastern techniques of efficiency

551
00:43:40,431 --> 00:43:41,625
and focus and unlimited...

552
00:43:41,732 --> 00:43:42,994
Mr Corleone

553
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,294
Mr Corleone, excuse me.

554
00:43:44,401 --> 00:43:48,531
Didn't you recently deposit 200 million

555
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:49,901
in the Vatican Bank,

556
00:43:50,007 --> 00:43:52,840
which is affiliated with Immobiliare?

557
00:43:52,943 --> 00:43:54,274
True. Why not?

558
00:43:54,378 --> 00:43:57,176
Wasn't there any questioning about the timing

559
00:43:57,281 --> 00:44:00,717
on this particular deposit?

560
00:44:00,818 --> 00:44:02,445
Mr Chairman, if I may?

561
00:44:04,755 --> 00:44:07,053
The Vito Andolini Corleone Foundation,

562
00:44:07,157 --> 00:44:09,318
of which Mary Corleone is chairman,

563
00:44:09,426 --> 00:44:12,884
has made an endowment of 100 million dollars.

564
00:44:12,996 --> 00:44:17,228
The money comes from his own family and will be administered by the Vatican.

565
00:44:17,334 --> 00:44:19,165
Does that answer your question?

566
00:44:20,037 --> 00:44:26,840
I have always believed that helping your fellow man is profitable in every sense,

567
00:44:26,944 --> 00:44:29,811
personally and bottom line.

568
00:44:29,913 --> 00:44:31,847
My fellow shareholders,

569
00:44:31,949 --> 00:44:35,350
if Europe and America can learn to co-operate,

570
00:44:35,486 --> 00:44:39,650
if we can learn to pool our wealth, share our markets,

571
00:44:39,756 --> 00:44:42,725
we can defeat any competition

572
00:44:42,826 --> 00:44:45,351
anywhere in the world.

573
00:44:45,462 --> 00:44:48,260
Thank you for your time.

574
00:44:48,365 --> 00:44:53,428
I hope that you will look favourably on my proposal. Thank you.

575
00:44:59,143 --> 00:45:01,134
Let me have this microphone here.

576
00:45:01,245 --> 00:45:04,772
Will we let a criminal run our company?

577
00:45:04,882 --> 00:45:07,749
He's got the map of Sicily on his face!

578
00:45:07,818 --> 00:45:08,807
Order!

579
00:45:08,886 --> 00:45:10,751
He's either a Catholic or a mafioso...

580
00:45:13,624 --> 00:45:17,788
The Hamiiton Investors Group cannot support this proposal.

581
00:45:18,795 --> 00:45:20,422
Your excellency...

582
00:45:21,298 --> 00:45:23,061
Mr Chairman...

583
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,162
...the Vatican Bank feels

584
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:30,934
that International Immobiliare...

585
00:45:31,642 --> 00:45:36,272
...will be safe in Mr Corleone's hands.

586
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,508
...subject to audit and final ratification,

587
00:45:39,616 --> 00:45:41,277
which must take place in Rome.

588
00:45:41,385 --> 00:45:45,185
Please join me in welcoming Mr Michael Corleone.

589
00:45:55,232 --> 00:45:56,722
Dad?

590
00:45:59,236 --> 00:46:02,763
Tony says that I'm a front for the foundation.

591
00:46:04,141 --> 00:46:07,770
That you're using me to pull the strings.

592
00:46:07,945 --> 00:46:09,537
To get the money where you want it.

593
00:46:09,646 --> 00:46:11,273
Please!

594
00:46:11,415 --> 00:46:13,610
To shine up your public image.

595
00:46:13,717 --> 00:46:15,446
Mary!

596
00:46:15,586 --> 00:46:18,111
Mary, this is real. This foundation

597
00:46:18,222 --> 00:46:20,190
is real.

598
00:46:21,892 --> 00:46:27,057
I wanted Anthony to be part of it. I thought you would be together on this.

599
00:46:27,164 --> 00:46:29,098
I won't interfere.

600
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:30,689
I'll help, but only if you ask.

601
00:46:30,801 --> 00:46:34,328
What is this really for?

602
00:46:34,504 --> 00:46:36,404
Why are you doing this?

603
00:46:36,506 --> 00:46:38,701
Why am I doing this?

604
00:46:39,443 --> 00:46:42,503
I'm doing this for my children.

605
00:46:42,613 --> 00:46:45,104
You're doing it for your children too.

606
00:46:45,215 --> 00:46:48,343
This foundation is supposed to help all people?

607
00:46:48,452 --> 00:46:50,750
That's the purpose.

608
00:46:50,887 --> 00:46:53,617
This is legitimate. Mary,

609
00:46:53,724 --> 00:46:56,750
I swear, this is legitimate.

610
00:46:59,763 --> 00:47:02,891
Dad, I want this to bring me closer to you.

611
00:47:11,108 --> 00:47:13,133
I would burn in hell

612
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:15,944
to keep you safe.

613
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:33,960
Go in the other car. I'll ride with Michael. Go, go, go.

614
00:47:47,978 --> 00:47:50,640
As your family's oldest friend,

615
00:47:50,781 --> 00:47:54,444
I'm always chosen to bring you messages.

616
00:47:56,219 --> 00:48:01,316
Tell me, Don Altobello.

617
00:48:01,425 --> 00:48:05,862
Your old partners are grateful for the money you made them.

618
00:48:05,962 --> 00:48:07,953
They worship you...

619
00:48:08,365 --> 00:48:15,203
...but their hearts are broken, because they think you abandoned them.

620
00:48:15,305 --> 00:48:19,867
They want to share your deal on Immobiliare,

621
00:48:19,976 --> 00:48:21,739
to be a family again.

622
00:48:21,845 --> 00:48:25,144
it can purify their money.

623
00:48:26,416 --> 00:48:28,475
This I cannot do.

624
00:48:30,987 --> 00:48:35,253
Immobiliare must be legitimate.

625
00:48:35,926 --> 00:48:42,058
I know. But they're unhappy.

626
00:48:42,999 --> 00:48:44,830
And you?

627
00:48:44,935 --> 00:48:48,803
I ask nothing for myself.

628
00:48:48,905 --> 00:48:51,169
Only peace in my old age.

629
00:48:51,274 --> 00:48:56,109
But I must please the world around me.

630
00:48:56,413 --> 00:49:00,873
Michael, your father was a reasonable man.

631
00:49:00,984 --> 00:49:03,350
Learn from him.

632
00:49:04,788 --> 00:49:08,884
I learned many things from my father.

633
00:49:13,697 --> 00:49:16,063
Call a meeting, my friend,

634
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:20,432
so there are no debts or grudges.

635
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:22,265
We will make the peace,

636
00:49:22,372 --> 00:49:24,465
you and I.

637
00:49:34,317 --> 00:49:40,119

638
00:49:40,857 --> 00:49:43,291
The Vatican announced today...

639
00:49:43,393 --> 00:49:46,294
that pope paul Vl

640
00:49:46,396 --> 00:49:49,331
has canceled his Sunday blessing...

641
00:49:49,433 --> 00:49:52,493
due to ill health.

642
00:49:52,602 --> 00:49:56,766
His physician has ordered total bedrest...

643
00:49:56,907 --> 00:50:01,606
and cessation of all activities.

644
00:50:03,046 --> 00:50:05,071
They've had a press conference.

645
00:50:05,215 --> 00:50:09,311
The Pope's condition is grave. "Gravissimo."

646
00:50:20,664 --> 00:50:30,096

647
00:50:35,712 --> 00:50:40,081
The purpose of this meeting is to ratify...

648
00:50:40,217 --> 00:50:45,154
the motion passed by our shareholders in New York.

649
00:50:46,089 --> 00:50:47,852
Please...

650
00:50:48,358 --> 00:50:52,954
Our group represents a consortium of Catholic businessmen

651
00:50:53,063 --> 00:50:56,692
against the Corleone control.

652
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,166
The Vatican has cast its vote.

653
00:50:59,269 --> 00:51:02,261
Corleone Group already controls the Board.

654
00:51:02,372 --> 00:51:04,237
According to the Lateran Treaty,

655
00:51:04,341 --> 00:51:07,970
the Vatican vote must be ratified here. Here in Rome,

656
00:51:08,078 --> 00:51:09,773
by the Pope.

657
00:51:13,149 --> 00:51:17,677
The Pope is gravely ill.

658
00:51:17,821 --> 00:51:20,016
Until he recovers,

659
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:22,554
I am powerless.

660
00:51:22,659 --> 00:51:24,684
-What if he dies?
-Then...

661
00:51:24,861 --> 00:51:28,024
...as you Americans say,

662
00:51:28,131 --> 00:51:29,962
all bets are off.

663
00:51:30,066 --> 00:51:33,263
Gentlemen, please.

664
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:37,864
This is a brief delay. Nothing more.

665
00:51:41,778 --> 00:51:45,305
Your Excellency, gentlemen...

666
00:51:45,415 --> 00:51:48,873
I advise you to join us in our prayers

667
00:51:48,985 --> 00:51:51,715
for the Holy Father's recovery.

668
00:51:52,055 --> 00:51:54,683
We had an agreement!

669
00:51:55,091 --> 00:51:59,050
This meeting was to be merely a formality.

670
00:51:59,162 --> 00:52:02,529
-Please sit down.
-I'd rather stand. Give me an answer.

671
00:52:02,632 --> 00:52:04,463

672
00:52:04,534 --> 00:52:08,197
The Immobiliare has its roots in the European tradition.

673
00:52:08,305 --> 00:52:10,671
Please understand.

674
00:52:10,774 --> 00:52:12,264
I understand.

675
00:52:12,375 --> 00:52:14,240
Your tactics are despicable.

676
00:52:14,344 --> 00:52:17,677
That's quite an indictment, coming from a Corleone.

677
00:52:17,781 --> 00:52:19,749
Gentlemen, gentlemen!

678
00:52:19,883 --> 00:52:22,613
Remember you are in the Vatican.

679
00:52:25,655 --> 00:52:28,123
What is it that you want?

680
00:52:28,224 --> 00:52:31,887
Yes, you will take control.

681
00:52:32,295 --> 00:52:35,924
We'll gladly put you at the helm of our little fleet,

682
00:52:36,466 --> 00:52:41,096
but our ships must all sail in the same direction.

683
00:52:41,972 --> 00:52:43,462
Otherwise,

684
00:52:43,573 --> 00:52:48,738
who can say how long your stay with us will last?

685
00:52:49,779 --> 00:52:51,747
it's not personal.

686
00:52:52,048 --> 00:52:56,849
it's only business. You should know, Godfather.

687
00:52:59,723 --> 00:53:02,021
Very well.

688
00:53:02,359 --> 00:53:04,884
You want to do business with me?

689
00:53:05,295 --> 00:53:08,196
I will do business with you.

690
00:53:08,465 --> 00:53:10,399
Vipers, all of them.

691
00:53:16,673 --> 00:53:18,368
We're back with the Borgias!

692
00:53:18,475 --> 00:53:21,444
-Uncle Michael...
-Andrew!

693
00:53:21,544 --> 00:53:24,206
I heard you were here. it's so nice to see you.

694
00:53:24,314 --> 00:53:27,283
Vincent, it's so nice.

695
00:53:27,417 --> 00:53:30,284
What is this about the Borgias? Those days are over.

696
00:53:36,192 --> 00:53:37,784
Recognise it?

697
00:53:37,894 --> 00:53:39,293
Yeah.

698
00:53:39,829 --> 00:53:41,592
Genco Olive Oil.

699
00:53:41,765 --> 00:53:43,630
That's where our grandfather started

700
00:53:43,733 --> 00:53:45,997
as a delivery boy.

701
00:53:46,102 --> 00:53:48,366
Three years later he owned it.

702
00:53:48,471 --> 00:53:49,563
Only in America.

703
00:53:49,673 --> 00:53:51,265
That's it.

704
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:54,006
Vincenzo, where have you been hiding?

705
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:55,600

706
00:53:55,712 --> 00:53:56,872
We need your help so badly.

707
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,311
What can I do for you?

708
00:53:58,415 --> 00:53:59,780
Get rid of Joe Zasa.

709
00:53:59,883 --> 00:54:01,544
He sells drugs...

710
00:54:01,651 --> 00:54:03,448

711
00:54:03,586 --> 00:54:05,850
Now that I'm an older woman, I'm afraid to go out at night.

712
00:54:05,955 --> 00:54:08,185
Where should they be now?

713
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:10,653
Lou, what's going on?

714
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,022
We're late.

715
00:54:13,697 --> 00:54:14,721
Have I ever let you down?

716
00:54:14,831 --> 00:54:16,093
I trust you.

717
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:17,257
Don't worry.

718
00:54:17,367 --> 00:54:18,698
Thank you.

719
00:54:18,802 --> 00:54:20,235
Enjoy yourselves.

720
00:54:27,043 --> 00:54:28,738
What was that?

721
00:54:29,479 --> 00:54:31,447
The neighbourhood's in trouble.

722
00:54:31,981 --> 00:54:33,471
Do you keep an eye out for them?

723
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:34,811
Yes.

724
00:54:34,918 --> 00:54:36,283
And for me?

725
00:54:36,453 --> 00:54:37,977
From now on.

726
00:54:38,655 --> 00:54:40,020
I've missed you all this time.

727
00:54:40,123 --> 00:54:42,216
I missed you too, cousin.

728
00:54:42,726 --> 00:54:45,627
I missed growing up with my cousins.

729
00:54:45,729 --> 00:54:48,357
I didn't even know you, but missed you.

730
00:54:48,765 --> 00:54:53,395
Do you remember stories about our fathers? The old days?

731
00:54:53,503 --> 00:54:55,437
Yeah, what do you want to know?

732
00:54:58,174 --> 00:55:00,005
What was Sonny like?

733
00:55:02,212 --> 00:55:04,680
Well, he was the Prince of the City.

734
00:55:05,014 --> 00:55:06,538
He died before I was born,

735
00:55:06,649 --> 00:55:10,050
but I've heard a lot about him.

736
00:55:10,453 --> 00:55:12,546
What about my father?

737
00:55:12,655 --> 00:55:14,782
He's a great man.

738
00:55:15,658 --> 00:55:18,354
He's a hero. He saved the family.

739
00:55:19,896 --> 00:55:21,591
-Vincent?
-What?

740
00:55:21,698 --> 00:55:23,859
Did he kill his own brother?

741
00:55:28,404 --> 00:55:30,429
No.

742
00:55:32,308 --> 00:55:34,640
So, it's all lies?

743
00:55:38,314 --> 00:55:42,808
Just stories, sweetheart. Okay?

744
00:55:45,588 --> 00:55:47,749
Okay.

745
00:55:48,525 --> 00:55:50,720
I believe you.

746
00:55:51,494 --> 00:55:52,984
I'm glad you're around.

747
00:55:53,096 --> 00:55:55,223
I'm glad you're here too.

748
00:55:59,769 --> 00:56:02,033
Cugina...

749
00:56:02,238 --> 00:56:04,103
Cous...

750
00:56:18,054 --> 00:56:21,683
I'd like to take Joey Zasa for a ride in this and drop him.

751
00:56:21,791 --> 00:56:24,555
Joey Zasa is nothing.

752
00:56:24,661 --> 00:56:26,959
He's a small time enforcer.

753
00:56:27,063 --> 00:56:29,896
He bluffs and threatens. He's nothing.

754
00:56:29,999 --> 00:56:33,230
You can see him coming a mile away.

755
00:56:33,336 --> 00:56:36,533
-We should kill him before he...
-No!

756
00:56:39,075 --> 00:56:44,012
Never hate your enemies. it affects your judgement.

757
00:56:51,654 --> 00:56:56,717

758
00:56:59,562 --> 00:57:02,793
Nice to see you again, Mr Corleone.

759
00:57:22,552 --> 00:57:25,453
Hey, girls. Let's go.

760
00:57:42,939 --> 00:57:47,239
We trusted you to manage our money in the casinos.

761
00:57:47,343 --> 00:57:50,904
it's not even 20 years. You've sold the casinos

762
00:57:51,014 --> 00:57:53,107
and made fortunes for all of us.

763
00:57:53,216 --> 00:57:57,676
Bravo, Don Corleone!

764
00:57:57,787 --> 00:57:59,584
Thank you.

765
00:57:59,756 --> 00:58:03,283
Friends, I have come here

766
00:58:03,393 --> 00:58:07,853
because our business together is done.

767
00:58:08,331 --> 00:58:09,992
We have prospered,

768
00:58:10,099 --> 00:58:12,124
and now it is time for us

769
00:58:12,235 --> 00:58:15,864
to dissolve the business relationship between us.

770
00:58:17,407 --> 00:58:19,068
That's it.

771
00:58:19,175 --> 00:58:23,509
But I do have a little surprise. Al?

772
00:58:25,515 --> 00:58:28,211
Your shares in the casinos.

773
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:32,049
I've cut the red tape, so you could get your money right away.

774
00:58:32,288 --> 00:58:33,915

775
00:58:34,257 --> 00:58:35,656

776
00:58:35,758 --> 00:58:36,782

777
00:58:38,661 --> 00:58:41,152
50 million dollars!

778
00:58:41,264 --> 00:58:46,930
-Not everybody gets the same. it depends on your investment.
-Nothing for you...

779
00:58:47,036 --> 00:58:50,164
Michael, this is really generous!

780
00:58:50,306 --> 00:58:52,831
Wonderful!

781
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:55,534

782
00:58:55,645 --> 00:58:58,443
Parisi, how much did you invest?

783
00:58:58,715 --> 00:58:59,773
I don't remember.

784
00:58:59,849 --> 00:59:02,317
You're blessed.

785
00:59:07,423 --> 00:59:10,881
My family has done much of the hard work,

786
00:59:10,994 --> 00:59:13,360
taken many risks.

787
00:59:14,364 --> 00:59:18,528
All to make money for the rest of the families.

788
00:59:19,836 --> 00:59:22,771
You all know Joey Zasa.

789
00:59:22,872 --> 00:59:26,205
He is, I admit, an important man.

790
00:59:26,376 --> 00:59:30,676
His picture is on the cover of the New York Times magazine.

791
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:35,911
He gets the Esquire Magazine award for the best dressed gangster.

792
00:59:36,019 --> 00:59:41,116
The newspapers praise him because he hires Blacks,

793
00:59:41,224 --> 00:59:43,351
which shows he has a good heart.

794
00:59:45,094 --> 00:59:49,258
He is famous. Who knows?

795
00:59:49,365 --> 00:59:51,230
Maybe one day

796
00:59:51,334 --> 00:59:54,599
he'll make all of you popular.

797
00:59:55,471 --> 00:59:56,631
it's true.

798
00:59:56,739 --> 01:00:00,573
I make more of a bella figura.

799
01:00:00,676 --> 01:00:02,439
That is my nature.

800
01:00:02,545 --> 01:00:07,505
But I also want to make a move into legitimate enterprises.

801
01:00:07,617 --> 01:00:10,085
I'd like a little pin from the Pope.

802
01:00:10,586 --> 01:00:13,453
Sure, I take the Blacks

803
01:00:13,556 --> 01:00:15,922
and the Spanish into my family,

804
01:00:16,025 --> 01:00:20,086
because that's America.

805
01:00:20,196 --> 01:00:25,224
And you guarantee that they don't deal drugs?

806
01:00:25,334 --> 01:00:27,359
I don't guarantee that.

807
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:31,304
I guarantee that I'll kill anybody who does.

808
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:37,975
Let me talk to him.

809
01:00:38,081 --> 01:00:40,276
Who can refuse Don Altobello?

810
01:00:40,383 --> 01:00:41,645
Joey, are you...

811
01:00:41,751 --> 01:00:43,275
No!

812
01:00:43,419 --> 01:00:44,545
I say to all of you:

813
01:00:44,687 --> 01:00:49,852
I have been treated this day with no respect.

814
01:00:49,959 --> 01:00:51,984
I've earned you all money.

815
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,858
I've made you rich

816
01:00:53,963 --> 01:00:55,396
and I asked for little.

817
01:00:55,498 --> 01:00:58,092
Good. You will not give,

818
01:00:58,201 --> 01:01:00,601
so I'll take!

819
01:01:00,703 --> 01:01:03,467
As for Don Corleone,

820
01:01:03,573 --> 01:01:07,373
he makes it very clear to me today

821
01:01:07,477 --> 01:01:10,969
that he is my enemy.

822
01:01:13,249 --> 01:01:15,877
You must choose between us.

823
01:01:19,021 --> 01:01:24,015
No, Joey!

824
01:01:24,127 --> 01:01:27,426
Michael, we could reason together.

825
01:01:27,997 --> 01:01:31,763
No. Michael, please...

826
01:01:31,901 --> 01:01:33,334
let's agree.

827
01:01:33,436 --> 01:01:35,802
He doesn't know what he's...

828
01:01:35,938 --> 01:01:37,803
No, no.

829
01:01:42,311 --> 01:01:45,940
Michael, the news is everywhere.

830
01:01:46,048 --> 01:01:50,144
Everyone says that you control Immobiliare.

831
01:01:50,286 --> 01:01:53,915
Immobiliare is already laundering money in Peru

832
01:01:54,023 --> 01:01:56,355
and Nassau.

833
01:01:56,526 --> 01:02:00,963
We've worked with you for 40 years. We should wet our beaks a little.

834
01:02:01,063 --> 01:02:03,657
We want to do business with you.

835
01:02:03,766 --> 01:02:08,965
That's right, we've been together...

836
01:02:16,145 --> 01:02:20,172
-it's a hit! Let's go!
-Let's get out of here! Move!

837
01:02:38,434 --> 01:02:39,958
My coat! it's my lucky coat!

838
01:02:40,069 --> 01:02:43,698
it's my lucky coat!

839
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:52,207
Stay behind me!

840
01:03:08,064 --> 01:03:10,191
Mikey, this way!

841
01:03:17,673 --> 01:03:22,007
Zasa, you son-of-a-bitch...

842
01:03:42,131 --> 01:03:43,826
Come on. We're out of here.

843
01:04:16,699 --> 01:04:19,133
-You did good, Vincent.
-Grazie.

844
01:04:19,402 --> 01:04:22,371
The old Dons were pretty much wiped out.

845
01:04:22,605 --> 01:04:26,871
The survivors made deals with Zasa.

846
01:04:27,043 --> 01:04:28,135
Altobello?

847
01:04:28,244 --> 01:04:29,541
He survived.

848
01:04:29,645 --> 01:04:32,375
He's with his daughters in Staten Island.

849
01:04:32,481 --> 01:04:35,348
He says he's going to retire in Sicily.

850
01:04:36,452 --> 01:04:41,856
Joey Zasa would never pull something like this without the backing.

851
01:04:41,957 --> 01:04:45,017
He's just muscle.

852
01:04:45,127 --> 01:04:47,459
He doesn't have the wit for that helicopter attack.

853
01:04:47,563 --> 01:04:52,023
He doesn't even have the ambition to wipe out the whole Commission.

854
01:04:52,134 --> 01:04:56,093
I say we hit back and take Zasa out!

855
01:05:00,543 --> 01:05:03,103
Never let anyone know what you're thinking.

856
01:05:11,387 --> 01:05:14,948
Let's get a message to Joey Zasa.

857
01:05:17,593 --> 01:05:20,061
I respect what he's done.

858
01:05:21,063 --> 01:05:24,396
The new overthrows the old. it's natural.

859
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,491
How can you do business with this guy?

860
01:05:29,472 --> 01:05:31,099
I'm a businessman, first and foremost.

861
01:05:31,207 --> 01:05:33,698
I want no further conflict.

862
01:05:33,809 --> 01:05:36,243
Tell him that he can live or he can die.

863
01:05:36,345 --> 01:05:38,836
Vincent, will you shut up!

864
01:05:56,732 --> 01:05:58,199
That's it.

865
01:06:00,369 --> 01:06:05,033
Joey Zasa... He can't be doing this alone.

866
01:06:08,611 --> 01:06:10,806
Just when I thought I was out,

867
01:06:10,913 --> 01:06:13,609
they pull me back in.

868
01:06:21,857 --> 01:06:28,626
Our true enemy has not yet shown his face.

869
01:06:31,333 --> 01:06:35,633
Michael!

870
01:06:35,805 --> 01:06:37,329

871
01:06:39,575 --> 01:06:40,564
Has he had his medicine?

872
01:06:40,676 --> 01:06:42,234
I don't know what he took.

873
01:06:46,015 --> 01:06:51,146
-I've got my wind back.
-Call a doctor.

874
01:06:51,253 --> 01:06:53,118
-Run, run, run!
-Vincent!

875
01:06:53,222 --> 01:06:57,386
Run at thunder, girl! Thunder can't hurt!

876
01:06:57,493 --> 01:06:59,757
Harmless noise!

877
01:06:59,862 --> 01:07:01,796
Bullshit!

878
01:07:02,164 --> 01:07:05,463
You deceitful old fuck!

879
01:07:05,601 --> 01:07:08,661
Altobello, you fuck!

880
01:07:10,906 --> 01:07:12,464
Fredo!

881
01:07:13,075 --> 01:07:15,270
Fredo!

882
01:07:16,145 --> 01:07:17,578

883
01:07:38,467 --> 01:07:41,595
Oh, God! Dad!

884
01:07:43,339 --> 01:07:45,500
Excuse me.

885
01:07:45,774 --> 01:07:47,207
I'll call kay.

886
01:07:57,753 --> 01:07:58,845
Good evening, sir.

887
01:07:58,921 --> 01:08:00,616
Can we wait here? We'll be back soon.

888
01:08:00,723 --> 01:08:02,054

889
01:08:08,430 --> 01:08:12,491
Mr Harrison, you said it was urgent.

890
01:08:12,601 --> 01:08:14,967
Have you come to confess your sins?

891
01:08:15,137 --> 01:08:17,401
Michael Corleone has had a diabetic stroke. I wanted you to know about it.

892
01:08:17,506 --> 01:08:19,701

893
01:08:20,743 --> 01:08:22,677
He's in a coma.

894
01:08:22,778 --> 01:08:25,804
I'm here to insist the deal goes through in any event.

895
01:08:25,915 --> 01:08:28,645
The Pope has not much time left.

896
01:08:29,151 --> 01:08:33,349
So, as you, I am in a difficuit position.

897
01:08:33,455 --> 01:08:36,618
We have to ratify this deal as soon as possible.

898
01:08:37,526 --> 01:08:39,426
We have an understanding.

899
01:08:39,562 --> 01:08:41,086
Good.

900
01:08:41,697 --> 01:08:42,789
I'm going to the hospital.

901
01:08:42,898 --> 01:08:44,832
I'll pray for Mr Corleone.

902
01:08:44,934 --> 01:08:46,629

903
01:08:50,205 --> 01:08:51,866
Our thoughts are with Mr Corleone.

904
01:08:51,974 --> 01:08:53,498
Thank you, Father Jim.

905
01:08:56,645 --> 01:09:01,309
Everything would be out in the open if Corleone dies.

906
01:09:01,584 --> 01:09:04,417
Play for time, keinszig.

907
01:09:04,486 --> 01:09:10,447
A habit born of a long contemplation of eternity.

908
01:09:15,831 --> 01:09:17,230
Forget about it, Vinnie.

909
01:09:17,333 --> 01:09:19,665
Why? it's a simple hit.

910
01:09:19,768 --> 01:09:24,228
I'd love to smack Joey Zasa and then whack the fag.

911
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:26,103
But it's impossible.

912
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:28,005
He's always with people,

913
01:09:28,110 --> 01:09:29,509
in front of TV cameras

914
01:09:29,612 --> 01:09:31,637
in his own neighbourhood.

915
01:09:31,747 --> 01:09:35,239
-it's not impossible. it'll work for us.
-How?

916
01:09:35,351 --> 01:09:39,754
Do you think he's going to let Uncle Michael survive? Would you?

917
01:09:40,489 --> 01:09:42,980
He may not survive anyway.

918
01:09:43,826 --> 01:09:44,918
How would you do it?

919
01:09:45,027 --> 01:09:47,894
I'd do it myself.

920
01:09:49,231 --> 01:09:50,926
Do it!

921
01:09:53,235 --> 01:09:56,068
-What would you need?
-A couple of guys.

922
01:10:26,935 --> 01:10:28,732
Hello, Michael.

923
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,369
it's kay.

924
01:10:38,313 --> 01:10:44,775
kay... I never expected you.

925
01:10:44,887 --> 01:10:47,822
No, I know.

926
01:10:49,591 --> 01:10:52,992
-But I'm here.
-I'm glad.

927
01:10:56,298 --> 01:10:58,095
You know...

928
01:11:00,569 --> 01:11:04,005
I've never seen you looking so helpless.

929
01:11:07,776 --> 01:11:09,801
it's not so bad, really.

930
01:11:11,814 --> 01:11:13,714
I feel...

931
01:11:14,316 --> 01:11:16,216
I'm getting wiser now.

932
01:11:16,318 --> 01:11:19,116
-Yeah.
-Oh, yeah.

933
01:11:19,722 --> 01:11:22,190
The sicker you get, the wiser you get?

934
01:11:22,958 --> 01:11:25,893
When I'm dead, I'll be really smart.

935
01:11:26,862 --> 01:11:28,557
Michael...

936
01:11:29,131 --> 01:11:32,157
I want to thank you for Tony.

937
01:11:34,369 --> 01:11:38,533
He's doing really well. He's gotten some very good notices,

938
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,767
and he'll make his operatic debut

939
01:11:40,876 --> 01:11:43,970
in Sicily, in Palermo this Easter, so...

940
01:11:45,948 --> 01:11:47,472
So, thank you.

941
01:11:48,684 --> 01:11:53,917
That's a real honour. in Sicily.

942
01:11:56,825 --> 01:12:00,784
I will be there. I won't miss that.

943
01:12:00,896 --> 01:12:03,194
I won't miss that.

944
01:12:08,871 --> 01:12:13,968
Mary, Tony... Go see Dad.

945
01:12:20,249 --> 01:12:21,739
-Sweetheart!
-Everything's going to be all right.

946
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:24,375
Tony!

947
01:12:24,787 --> 01:12:27,278
How are you doing, Pop?

948
01:12:29,224 --> 01:12:32,352
Your mother told me what happened.

949
01:12:32,461 --> 01:12:35,589
About Palermo? I hope you'll be there.

950
01:12:35,697 --> 01:12:38,791
Of course. kiss me.

951
01:12:57,853 --> 01:12:58,911
Cousin Vinnie?

952
01:12:59,021 --> 01:13:02,286
He's not here. Call his apartment.

953
01:13:02,391 --> 01:13:03,949

954
01:13:04,126 --> 01:13:05,457
it's your cousin Mary.

955
01:13:05,561 --> 01:13:07,153
Let her in.

956
01:13:10,132 --> 01:13:11,497

957
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,261
Hi, cous.

958
01:13:13,368 --> 01:13:15,700
I thought I'd drop by. Is that okay?

959
01:13:15,804 --> 01:13:17,601
I'll get the guys.

960
01:13:19,575 --> 01:13:23,534
No, it's not okay. You shouldn't have come, Mary.

961
01:13:24,213 --> 01:13:26,340
Only a couple of minutes, okay?

962
01:13:27,983 --> 01:13:30,349
-You look beautiful, cous.
-Thanks.

963
01:13:33,822 --> 01:13:37,258
So this is your club, your hideout?

964
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:38,656
Yeah.

965
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,625
I came here to check it out.

966
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,096
it's so strange, just me and Aunt Connie in the house.

967
01:13:49,204 --> 01:13:52,139
I feel better when I'm with you.

968
01:13:52,341 --> 01:13:54,172
What's wrong, sweetheart?

969
01:13:54,276 --> 01:13:55,937
I'm scared about my father.

970
01:13:56,011 --> 01:13:57,000
Don't be.

971
01:13:57,079 --> 01:14:00,810
When they took him out of the ambulance, I thought he was dead.

972
01:14:00,916 --> 01:14:03,544
Everybody says he's going to be better.

973
01:14:05,654 --> 01:14:07,679
Don't worry.

974
01:14:07,789 --> 01:14:11,350
I remember a shooting when I was little.

975
01:14:11,693 --> 01:14:14,685
And one time Al Neri and other bodyguards

976
01:14:14,796 --> 01:14:17,424
took me and Tony away.

977
01:14:18,533 --> 01:14:21,024
Is it all happening again?

978
01:14:22,204 --> 01:14:24,638
Not like that, sweetie.

979
01:14:25,941 --> 01:14:30,435
Then why are you hiding here? Is something going to happen to you?

980
01:14:31,713 --> 01:14:34,079
Nothing's going to happen to me, cugina.

981
01:14:34,349 --> 01:14:36,874
We'll take care of you.

982
01:14:46,895 --> 01:14:48,863
Can I stay here and hide out with you?

983
01:14:48,964 --> 01:14:51,330
Can you help me cook for the boys?

984
01:14:51,466 --> 01:14:56,494
You know that I don't know how to cook, but I'll help.

985
01:15:08,150 --> 01:15:11,881
-Okay...
-What do I do?

986
01:15:44,386 --> 01:15:45,546
I love you, cous.

987
01:15:45,654 --> 01:15:47,087
I love you, too, cous.

988
01:15:51,093 --> 01:15:52,856
Let us cook.

989
01:16:09,544 --> 01:16:11,239
Hold me.

990
01:16:47,816 --> 01:16:52,310
You in the press and the police use words like "Mafia", "Cosa Nostra".

991
01:16:52,421 --> 01:16:54,150
This is a fantasy.

992
01:16:54,256 --> 01:16:58,989
We Italian-Americans laid the bricks that buiit this city.

993
01:16:59,094 --> 01:17:00,959
We have Meucci, who invented the telephone.

994
01:17:01,063 --> 01:17:04,464
We have Don Ameche, who played the guy who invented it.

995
01:17:04,633 --> 01:17:06,931
Buy yourself a raffle ticket,

996
01:17:07,069 --> 01:17:09,060
maybe you'll win a Cadillac.

997
01:17:10,238 --> 01:17:12,934
The salsiccia is wonderful!

998
01:17:13,041 --> 01:17:15,407
Here, have a sandwich.

999
01:17:27,856 --> 01:17:30,791
-Nice to see you, Mr Zasa.
-Have a nice time.

1000
01:17:33,028 --> 01:17:35,053
Don't forget to buy your raffle tickets.

1001
01:17:38,133 --> 01:17:40,226
-What are you doing?
-He didn't mean it.

1002
01:17:40,335 --> 01:17:42,462
Tell him you're sorry.

1003
01:17:42,604 --> 01:17:44,401
Okay, let's go.

1004
01:18:03,558 --> 01:18:06,789
Joey! How are you?

1005
01:18:06,895 --> 01:18:09,386
How are you, Buddy boy?

1006
01:18:10,098 --> 01:18:13,932
Hey, Joey Zasa! Joey, up your ass!

1007
01:18:15,003 --> 01:18:16,800
Who is this? Do you know him?

1008
01:18:17,239 --> 01:18:18,263
Ignore him.

1009
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:22,171
Who's going to win the car? The Ant?

1010
01:18:23,311 --> 01:18:26,280
This is what gives Italian-Americans a bad name.

1011
01:18:26,414 --> 01:18:27,938
A cappone like this.

1012
01:18:28,049 --> 01:18:30,847
Joey, up your ass!

1013
01:18:30,952 --> 01:18:33,921
Get off the car! Do you have a raffle ticket?

1014
01:18:34,256 --> 01:18:37,555
Joey, take a look at my raffle ticket!

1015
01:18:40,695 --> 01:18:42,219
Here's what I think of you... and your raffle ticket.

1016
01:18:42,330 --> 01:18:50,897
Get the fuck off this car. I'll break your fucking balls. Get out of here!

1017
01:19:06,521 --> 01:19:08,716
Run, Joey! You piece of shit!

1018
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:23,870
Open the door!

1019
01:19:23,972 --> 01:19:25,200
How are you, Joe?

1020
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:30,443
Zasa!

1021
01:19:47,662 --> 01:19:52,827
Don't ever again give that kind of order.

1022
01:19:52,934 --> 01:19:54,868
Not while I'm alive.

1023
01:19:54,970 --> 01:19:56,562
Understand?

1024
01:19:58,139 --> 01:20:00,403
You were too sick to make a decision.

1025
01:20:00,508 --> 01:20:05,036
I got a go-ahead from Neri and Connie.

1026
01:20:05,146 --> 01:20:06,670
Connie?

1027
01:20:16,191 --> 01:20:19,319
it was the right decision, Uncle Mike.

1028
01:20:19,661 --> 01:20:21,561
it was the wrong decision.

1029
01:20:21,696 --> 01:20:23,823
I command this family!

1030
01:20:23,932 --> 01:20:26,799
Right or wrong...

1031
01:20:26,901 --> 01:20:30,098
...it was not what I wanted!

1032
01:20:48,356 --> 01:20:50,256
Do you understand?

1033
01:20:57,299 --> 01:20:58,823
Yes.

1034
01:21:04,839 --> 01:21:07,034
Come on, Michael.

1035
01:21:18,153 --> 01:21:20,018
Yes.

1036
01:21:21,723 --> 01:21:25,682
Good. Vincent, help me to my bed.

1037
01:21:25,794 --> 01:21:28,786
I want to talk to you alone for a minute.

1038
01:21:35,937 --> 01:21:37,268
You know,

1039
01:21:37,739 --> 01:21:42,438
I always feit responsible for you. You know that.

1040
01:21:43,244 --> 01:21:44,871
Your father...

1041
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:49,711
...my brother, we were opposites.

1042
01:21:49,818 --> 01:21:51,649
We would fight and argue.

1043
01:21:52,253 --> 01:21:54,881
But I never doubted his love.

1044
01:21:54,989 --> 01:21:57,184
He would do anything for me.

1045
01:21:58,193 --> 01:21:59,922
But his temper...

1046
01:22:03,131 --> 01:22:04,894
Too much.

1047
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,468
it clouded his reason.

1048
01:22:08,570 --> 01:22:10,868
I don't want you to make that mistake.

1049
01:22:13,975 --> 01:22:15,670
Also...

1050
01:22:16,277 --> 01:22:19,735
...he, too, had a way with women.

1051
01:22:20,782 --> 01:22:26,618
-Vincent... What are you doing with my daughter?
-So I hear.

1052
01:22:28,623 --> 01:22:30,454
What are you doing with her?

1053
01:22:35,296 --> 01:22:38,026
it's too dangerous.

1054
01:22:40,402 --> 01:22:42,199
Do you hear me?

1055
01:22:48,276 --> 01:22:49,800
Okay.

1056
01:23:03,725 --> 01:23:05,590
Vincenzo...

1057
01:23:09,330 --> 01:23:10,922
When they come,

1058
01:23:11,766 --> 01:23:13,734
they'll come at what you love.

1059
01:23:21,810 --> 01:23:24,677
Michael, you must lead another life.

1060
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,578
You have everything a man could desire.

1061
01:23:27,715 --> 01:23:30,707
it's time for you to retire.

1062
01:23:31,586 --> 01:23:34,521
I have too much responsibility.

1063
01:23:35,190 --> 01:23:37,488
Immobiliare?

1064
01:23:37,592 --> 01:23:41,050
it's too difficuit now. You should really get out.

1065
01:23:41,162 --> 01:23:43,426
What do you know about

1066
01:23:43,531 --> 01:23:45,965
those pezzi da novanta in Italy?

1067
01:23:49,804 --> 01:23:53,638
I'm too old to know anything about those new people.

1068
01:23:53,741 --> 01:23:58,371
I must accept my age and grow my olives and tomatoes.

1069
01:23:59,681 --> 01:24:01,706
We're not that old.

1070
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:04,045
But you're very ill.

1071
01:24:04,519 --> 01:24:06,453
Michael...

1072
01:24:07,121 --> 01:24:09,419
Let me see what can be done.

1073
01:24:09,524 --> 01:24:13,426
Let me work to make your path a little easier.

1074
01:24:13,995 --> 01:24:17,556
Your friendship does that always.

1075
01:24:17,665 --> 01:24:19,656
That makes me happy.

1076
01:24:19,767 --> 01:24:24,602
Joey Zasa... You were wrong about him.

1077
01:24:25,106 --> 01:24:28,598
I trust too much. That's always been my fauit.

1078
01:24:36,317 --> 01:24:37,944
Michael...

1079
01:24:38,186 --> 01:24:40,416
treachery is everywhere.

1080
01:24:40,522 --> 01:24:45,255
You still have your fingers on the strings, even now.

1081
01:24:46,094 --> 01:24:48,392
Let's see more of each other.

1082
01:24:49,163 --> 01:24:50,858
Michael,

1083
01:24:50,965 --> 01:24:52,626
in Sicily?

1084
01:24:52,734 --> 01:24:54,201
in Sicily.

1085
01:24:54,502 --> 01:24:56,527
in Sicilia.

1086
01:24:56,738 --> 01:24:59,673
in Sicilia.

1087
01:25:06,614 --> 01:25:12,575

1088
01:25:46,692 --> 01:25:48,057
How are you?

1089
01:25:49,061 --> 01:25:51,962
Don Bendino, my old friend.

1090
01:26:23,061 --> 01:26:24,756
I brought you here,

1091
01:26:24,863 --> 01:26:26,524
so that my old friend and protector,

1092
01:26:26,632 --> 01:26:28,657
Don Tommasino,

1093
01:26:28,767 --> 01:26:30,564
could advise us.

1094
01:26:30,969 --> 01:26:35,030
What do you think about Altobello?

1095
01:26:37,175 --> 01:26:39,268
A very talented man.

1096
01:26:39,378 --> 01:26:40,936
He has kept the peace

1097
01:26:41,046 --> 01:26:44,209
between our Sicilian and American friends.

1098
01:26:44,316 --> 01:26:46,750
The saint of reason.

1099
01:26:48,887 --> 01:26:51,287
A blood bath in Atlantic City

1100
01:26:51,423 --> 01:26:53,015
left New York a mess.

1101
01:26:53,125 --> 01:26:56,424
Joey Zasa at least was running a tight ship,

1102
01:26:56,528 --> 01:27:00,396
but with him out of the picture we must step in.

1103
01:27:00,499 --> 01:27:02,194
Step back in...

1104
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:03,324
Or the Chinese

1105
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:04,992
and Colombians will.

1106
01:27:05,237 --> 01:27:07,262
The Corleones left drugs,

1107
01:27:07,372 --> 01:27:11,274
so New York is weak, and Palermo is strong.

1108
01:27:11,843 --> 01:27:13,640
Your enemies always get strong

1109
01:27:13,745 --> 01:27:15,838
on what you leave behind.

1110
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:18,282

1111
01:27:18,517 --> 01:27:23,750
Who could give the order for that massacre...

1112
01:27:24,956 --> 01:27:29,120
and still pressure the Vatican deal?

1113
01:27:29,227 --> 01:27:31,058
Only Lucchesi

1114
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:34,724
can reach between these two worlds.

1115
01:27:36,068 --> 01:27:39,560
"Our ships must all sail in the same direction"...

1116
01:27:41,073 --> 01:27:44,133
Italian politics have had these men for centuries.

1117
01:27:44,242 --> 01:27:47,006
They are the true Mafia.

1118
01:27:47,112 --> 01:27:50,309
The Archbishop and the Vatican Bank, that's the big problem.

1119
01:27:50,415 --> 01:27:52,110
They're the same problem.

1120
01:27:52,217 --> 01:27:55,186
B.J., they're connected.

1121
01:27:55,420 --> 01:27:58,480
The Archbishop has powerful friends.

1122
01:28:00,726 --> 01:28:02,591
They totally protect him.

1123
01:28:02,761 --> 01:28:07,562
Is there someone in the Church we can turn to?

1124
01:28:07,666 --> 01:28:09,861
Someone we can tell our problem to?

1125
01:28:12,237 --> 01:28:14,762
Cardinal Lamberto.

1126
01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:18,172
A wise and good man...

1127
01:28:18,276 --> 01:28:20,107
very influential.

1128
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:24,114
He will see you.

1129
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:30,916
I will see this Cardinal Lamberto

1130
01:28:31,022 --> 01:28:34,321
and see if we can work things out.

1131
01:28:35,827 --> 01:28:41,163
You honour your agreements, but you are dealing with crooks.

1132
01:28:41,266 --> 01:28:43,461
They have no honour.

1133
01:28:45,871 --> 01:28:47,634
My word is final.

1134
01:28:57,816 --> 01:29:02,276
Politics and crime, they're the same thing.

1135
01:29:18,503 --> 01:29:22,132

1136
01:29:24,376 --> 01:29:26,606
I've invited you all here

1137
01:29:26,711 --> 01:29:31,375
to celebrate my son's debut in an opera house...

1138
01:29:31,650 --> 01:29:35,677
We'll play "Philadelphia".

1139
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:39,382
Seven cards. Two down, four up. Deuces and one-eyed jacks are wild.

1140
01:29:39,491 --> 01:29:41,789
...in the opera "Cavallaria Rusticana".

1141
01:29:41,893 --> 01:29:44,657
It's "Cavalleria Rusticana", Dad.

1142
01:29:44,763 --> 01:29:48,164
"Cavalleria". I think I have tickets to the wrong opera.

1143
01:29:48,733 --> 01:29:50,166
I've been in New York too long.

1144
01:29:50,268 --> 01:29:53,829
You will all receive tickets,

1145
01:29:53,939 --> 01:29:55,463
so come on time.

1146
01:29:55,607 --> 01:29:56,835
Dad, I've got a present for you.

1147
01:29:56,908 --> 01:29:57,897

1148
01:29:57,976 --> 01:29:59,136

1149
01:30:01,613 --> 01:30:03,945
it comes from the town of Corleone

1150
01:30:04,049 --> 01:30:05,949
and it's authentic Sicilian.

1151
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:11,213
And... I learned it for you.

1152
01:31:40,078 --> 01:31:44,139
She was wonderful, beautiful. I loved her.

1153
01:31:44,249 --> 01:31:45,876
And then she died.

1154
01:31:46,618 --> 01:31:49,086
My trusted bodyguard

1155
01:31:50,021 --> 01:31:52,717
planted a bomb in my car.

1156
01:31:53,325 --> 01:31:55,350
She drove it before I did.

1157
01:31:57,062 --> 01:32:00,691
Why is such a beautiful country so violent?

1158
01:32:00,799 --> 01:32:02,289
History.

1159
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:06,996
Mom was telling me about when your biggest worry was passing your exams.

1160
01:32:07,105 --> 01:32:08,970
Yes, it was then.

1161
01:32:09,107 --> 01:32:10,972
I worry about you now.

1162
01:32:11,076 --> 01:32:16,309
Oh, Mary, you're such a warm-hearted girl. You always were.

1163
01:32:16,414 --> 01:32:18,041
I love my family.

1164
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:20,213
Even your cousin Vincent?

1165
01:32:23,722 --> 01:32:25,986
I really love him.

1166
01:32:27,359 --> 01:32:29,054
He's your first cousin.

1167
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:31,128
Then I love him first.

1168
01:32:31,629 --> 01:32:35,065
Mary, you can't see him.

1169
01:32:35,166 --> 01:32:37,896
Just don't see him anymore.

1170
01:32:38,336 --> 01:32:42,568
He's right. it's too dangerous.

1171
01:32:44,109 --> 01:32:45,371
Mary,

1172
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:48,742
you can't see him anymore. Not in that fashion.

1173
01:32:48,847 --> 01:32:50,178
No.

1174
01:32:51,316 --> 01:32:54,774
-Please, promise me.
-No!

1175
01:32:54,886 --> 01:32:56,148
Obey me on this.

1176
01:32:56,254 --> 01:32:57,949
No, Dad!

1177
01:33:02,494 --> 01:33:04,519
Mary is smart, Dad.

1178
01:33:05,163 --> 01:33:07,256
She'll understand eventually.

1179
01:33:29,821 --> 01:33:33,484
Bella cugina... Tesoro mio.

1180
01:33:44,202 --> 01:33:45,191
You wanted to see me?

1181
01:33:45,303 --> 01:33:46,736
Yeah.

1182
01:33:47,238 --> 01:33:49,536
I want you to do something for me.

1183
01:33:49,641 --> 01:33:51,074
it's dangerous.

1184
01:33:52,410 --> 01:33:56,312
Good. I'm in. What do you need?

1185
01:33:56,414 --> 01:33:59,315
I want you to sell your soul to Don Altobello.

1186
01:34:00,085 --> 01:34:01,746
To betray me.

1187
01:34:05,457 --> 01:34:07,049
He'd never believe me.

1188
01:34:08,426 --> 01:34:11,395
-That depends.
-Sit down.

1189
01:34:13,965 --> 01:34:15,523
I have an idea.

1190
01:34:17,001 --> 01:34:21,301
See if you can learn how high Altobello is connected.

1191
01:34:24,742 --> 01:34:27,176
Arrange a meeting.

1192
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:32,006
You say how devoted you are to me.

1193
01:34:32,283 --> 01:34:34,547
Tell him your problems.

1194
01:34:34,652 --> 01:34:36,847
Ask for his help.

1195
01:34:36,955 --> 01:34:38,547
What problems?

1196
01:34:39,557 --> 01:34:42,117
That you want to run away with my daughter.

1197
01:34:42,994 --> 01:34:47,897
But you know that if you do, I will become your enemy.

1198
01:34:52,036 --> 01:34:54,266
You know that I would never do that.

1199
01:34:54,539 --> 01:34:56,029
I know.

1200
01:34:56,808 --> 01:35:02,075
Ask Altobello to speak to me. To further the marriage.

1201
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:04,307
But you're cousins, after all.

1202
01:35:04,415 --> 01:35:07,782
Michael was always a little old-fashioned.

1203
01:35:07,919 --> 01:35:13,858
Say you can't belong to my legitimate world. That you want your own family.

1204
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:15,983
I could straighten out what Joey Zasa left behind.

1205
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:22,498
I could use your friendship to persuade him.

1206
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:25,330
I would be indebted to you forever.

1207
01:35:27,372 --> 01:35:29,135
A Corleone

1208
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:32,104
knows the value of such a friend.

1209
01:35:32,877 --> 01:35:35,675
Then you would work for me?

1210
01:35:36,347 --> 01:35:42,877
Si. Bacio la mano, Don Altobello.

1211
01:35:44,022 --> 01:35:45,683

1212
01:35:45,790 --> 01:35:49,783
if he hints that he wants you to betray me,

1213
01:35:49,928 --> 01:35:51,327
get insuited,

1214
01:35:51,462 --> 01:35:53,930
because that's his trap.

1215
01:36:00,405 --> 01:36:04,341
You're not telling me the whole truth, Vincenzo.

1216
01:36:06,744 --> 01:36:13,775
Isn't it true, that with Michael gone, the girl controls everything?

1217
01:36:16,521 --> 01:36:18,921
Leave the girl out of this.

1218
01:36:19,057 --> 01:36:22,823
Of course, you love her. And she loves you.

1219
01:36:42,947 --> 01:36:46,815
I guessed it, didn't I?

1220
01:36:47,352 --> 01:36:50,480
You're a wise man, Don Altobello.

1221
01:36:50,622 --> 01:36:53,318
I'll be learning a lot from you.

1222
01:36:53,424 --> 01:36:57,793
The richest man is the one with the most powerful friends.

1223
01:36:59,397 --> 01:37:03,299
it's my duty to make the introductions.

1224
01:37:09,007 --> 01:37:10,838
Don Lucchesi.

1225
01:37:13,745 --> 01:37:18,148
Don Altobello tells me that you have a strong character.

1226
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:19,580
A man of respect.

1227
01:37:19,684 --> 01:37:23,381
This is the hero who put Joey Zasa in his grave.

1228
01:37:23,488 --> 01:37:25,080
if we'd known of his existence,

1229
01:37:25,189 --> 01:37:27,817
we wouldn't have backed Joey.

1230
01:37:27,925 --> 01:37:30,223
No one wants another Joe.

1231
01:37:31,896 --> 01:37:34,694
Let me be your friend.

1232
01:37:34,799 --> 01:37:37,734
Even the strongest man needs friends.

1233
01:37:37,835 --> 01:37:39,359
I'm flattered.

1234
01:37:40,405 --> 01:37:43,238
You're a man of finance and politics.

1235
01:37:43,341 --> 01:37:45,468
Things I don't understand.

1236
01:37:46,577 --> 01:37:48,841
You understand guns.

1237
01:37:48,946 --> 01:37:51,312
Finance is a gun.

1238
01:37:51,416 --> 01:37:53,316
Politics...

1239
01:37:53,484 --> 01:37:56,942
is knowing when to pull the trigger.

1240
01:38:00,191 --> 01:38:01,886
How can I help?

1241
01:38:06,964 --> 01:38:09,728
Blessed is the peacemaker,

1242
01:38:09,834 --> 01:38:12,860
for he can be called the child of God.

1243
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:17,339
-Tu parli Italiano un poco?
-Si.

1244
01:38:38,296 --> 01:38:40,730
The wheelchair, for Don Tommasino.

1245
01:38:48,873 --> 01:38:52,434
I trusted this business arrangement with the Archbishop.

1246
01:38:52,543 --> 01:38:57,674
I trusted him. I was sure his honesty was beyond a doubt.

1247
01:38:57,782 --> 01:39:02,981
But, as you see, I'm now the victim of a swindle.

1248
01:39:03,087 --> 01:39:04,952
He's stalling me.

1249
01:39:05,089 --> 01:39:09,082
Vast monies have gone to people in high political places

1250
01:39:09,193 --> 01:39:12,060
and the Vatican Bank is the guarantor.

1251
01:39:12,163 --> 01:39:14,757
if what you say is true,

1252
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:18,063
there will be a great scandal.

1253
01:39:19,637 --> 01:39:21,127
Look at this stone.

1254
01:39:21,239 --> 01:39:24,538
it has been in the water for a very long time,

1255
01:39:24,642 --> 01:39:29,272
but the water has not penetrated it.

1256
01:39:32,350 --> 01:39:33,783
Look...

1257
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:36,949
Perfectly dry.

1258
01:39:37,522 --> 01:39:40,047
The same thing has happened to men in Europe.

1259
01:39:40,158 --> 01:39:44,959
For centuries they have been surrounded by Christianity,

1260
01:39:45,062 --> 01:39:47,792
but Christ has not penetrated.

1261
01:39:47,899 --> 01:39:52,233
Christ doesn't live within them.

1262
01:39:54,839 --> 01:39:55,897
What's happening?

1263
01:39:55,973 --> 01:40:00,273
Could you get me something sweet?

1264
01:40:00,378 --> 01:40:03,313
Some orange juice, candy...

1265
01:40:06,484 --> 01:40:09,419
I have trouble with diabetes.

1266
01:40:12,423 --> 01:40:14,891
My blood sugar goes low.

1267
01:40:15,026 --> 01:40:17,358
I understand.

1268
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:42,719
it happens sometimes when I'm under stress.

1269
01:40:43,554 --> 01:40:45,351
I understand.

1270
01:40:47,158 --> 01:40:49,149
To come to you

1271
01:40:49,527 --> 01:40:52,223
on such a delicate matter...

1272
01:40:53,865 --> 01:40:57,198
Accusations against your Archbishop.

1273
01:40:57,301 --> 01:40:59,929
it was difficuit for me.

1274
01:41:00,137 --> 01:41:02,230
The mind suffers

1275
01:41:02,406 --> 01:41:06,240
and the body cries out.

1276
01:41:09,146 --> 01:41:13,776
That's true.

1277
01:41:14,619 --> 01:41:19,386
Would you like to make your confession?

1278
01:41:25,429 --> 01:41:27,397
Your Eminence,

1279
01:41:27,965 --> 01:41:33,631
I'm... it's been so long.

1280
01:41:33,738 --> 01:41:38,141
I wouldn't... I wouldn't know where to...

1281
01:41:38,242 --> 01:41:41,268
it's been 30 years.

1282
01:41:41,612 --> 01:41:45,605
I'd use up too much of your time, I think.

1283
01:41:45,716 --> 01:41:49,447
I always have time to save souls.

1284
01:41:51,155 --> 01:41:53,783
Well, I'm beyond redemption.

1285
01:41:53,925 --> 01:41:56,155
No, no...

1286
01:42:03,868 --> 01:42:08,771
I hear the confessions of my own priests here.

1287
01:42:08,873 --> 01:42:13,105
Sometimes the desire to confess is overwhelming,

1288
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:16,077
and we must seize the moment.

1289
01:42:20,184 --> 01:42:22,482
What is the point of confessing

1290
01:42:22,587 --> 01:42:24,782
if I don't repent?

1291
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:29,757
I hear you are a practical man.

1292
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:33,091
What have you got to lose?

1293
01:42:43,708 --> 01:42:45,403
Go on.

1294
01:42:51,949 --> 01:42:54,144
I...

1295
01:42:54,485 --> 01:42:56,783
...betrayed my wife.

1296
01:42:58,055 --> 01:43:00,250
Go on, my son.

1297
01:43:05,363 --> 01:43:07,354
I betrayed myself.

1298
01:43:10,101 --> 01:43:11,966
I killed men.

1299
01:43:15,806 --> 01:43:18,400
And I ordered men to be killed.

1300
01:43:19,710 --> 01:43:23,077
Go on, my son. Go on.

1301
01:43:27,084 --> 01:43:29,609
it's useless.

1302
01:43:31,155 --> 01:43:33,521
Go on, my son.

1303
01:43:34,525 --> 01:43:36,322
I killed...

1304
01:43:40,731 --> 01:43:44,030
I ordered the death of my brother.

1305
01:43:44,468 --> 01:43:47,130
He injured me.

1306
01:43:47,872 --> 01:43:51,330
I killed my mother's son.

1307
01:43:51,776 --> 01:43:55,576
I killed my father's son.

1308
01:44:04,522 --> 01:44:06,786
Your sins are terrible,

1309
01:44:06,891 --> 01:44:10,554
and it is just that you suffer.

1310
01:44:10,695 --> 01:44:14,153
Your life could be redeemed,

1311
01:44:14,265 --> 01:44:16,460
but I know that you don't believe that.

1312
01:44:16,567 --> 01:44:18,660
You will not change.

1313
01:44:41,926 --> 01:44:45,157
the Supreme Pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church,...

1314
01:44:45,262 --> 01:44:50,723
Pope Paul Vl,

1315
01:44:50,835 --> 01:44:54,965
died last night at 9:40 p.m.

1316
01:44:55,072 --> 01:44:59,065
The Pope was 81 years old,...

1317
01:44:59,176 --> 01:45:04,944
and had been in poor health for the last several months.

1318
01:45:10,454 --> 01:45:11,921
Connie...

1319
01:45:13,691 --> 01:45:18,788
All my life I've kept trying to go up in society.

1320
01:45:18,929 --> 01:45:22,922
To where everything higher up was legal, straight...

1321
01:45:23,701 --> 01:45:28,035
But the higher I go, the more crooked it becomes.

1322
01:45:29,974 --> 01:45:32,204
Where the hell does it end?

1323
01:45:41,285 --> 01:45:44,584
They've been killing each other for centuries here.

1324
01:45:45,956 --> 01:45:47,685
For money,

1325
01:45:47,825 --> 01:45:51,488
for pride, for family.

1326
01:45:53,297 --> 01:45:58,030
To keep from becoming the slaves of the rich pezzi da novanta.

1327
01:46:04,508 --> 01:46:07,136
I made confession, Connie.

1328
01:46:07,645 --> 01:46:10,512
I confessed my sins.

1329
01:46:11,382 --> 01:46:13,976
Why? That's not like you.

1330
01:46:14,084 --> 01:46:17,451
You don't have to confess your sins to a stranger.

1331
01:46:17,555 --> 01:46:19,420
it was the man.

1332
01:46:20,257 --> 01:46:22,384
He's a good man.

1333
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:24,528
A true priest.

1334
01:46:27,932 --> 01:46:30,025
He can change things.

1335
01:46:32,436 --> 01:46:34,427
Michael...

1336
01:46:35,306 --> 01:46:37,171
You know,

1337
01:46:37,274 --> 01:46:40,107
sometimes I think of poor Fredo.

1338
01:46:40,211 --> 01:46:42,577
Drowned.

1339
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:44,477
it was God's will.

1340
01:46:46,016 --> 01:46:48,610
it was a terrible accident.

1341
01:46:49,553 --> 01:46:51,783
But it's finished.

1342
01:46:56,794 --> 01:46:58,955
Michael, I love you.

1343
01:47:00,831 --> 01:47:03,994
I'll always help you.

1344
01:47:15,212 --> 01:47:17,237
Oh, Connie...

1345
01:47:46,677 --> 01:47:49,407
I am honored, Don Altobello,

1346
01:47:49,513 --> 01:47:54,143
that you've come from Palermo to visit me.

1347
01:47:58,088 --> 01:48:02,616
Hey, the little kid! He's grown.

1348
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:05,285
Do the donkey for me.

1349
01:48:21,946 --> 01:48:24,414
it's been some time

1350
01:48:24,515 --> 01:48:27,382
since we did business together.

1351
01:48:29,853 --> 01:48:31,286
You are my "ace in the hole,"

1352
01:48:31,388 --> 01:48:34,687
as we say in America.

1353
01:48:35,092 --> 01:48:38,289
I have a stone in my shoe.

1354
01:48:38,395 --> 01:48:41,694
You can remove it.

1355
01:48:48,172 --> 01:48:50,606
Only one stone?

1356
01:48:53,277 --> 01:48:56,838
it's dangerous.

1357
01:48:56,981 --> 01:48:59,006
A famous man.

1358
01:48:59,116 --> 01:49:03,610
You will have to take precautions.

1359
01:49:05,489 --> 01:49:08,117
Tell me what to do.

1360
01:49:08,225 --> 01:49:11,752
Then I will tell you my price.

1361
01:49:16,266 --> 01:49:18,461
Ah, what bread!

1362
01:49:22,172 --> 01:49:24,663
Olive oil...

1363
01:49:29,580 --> 01:49:31,070
Virgin...

1364
01:49:31,181 --> 01:49:33,547
only in Sicily.

1365
01:49:35,686 --> 01:49:37,278
Alla salute!

1366
01:49:37,388 --> 01:49:39,356
To death.

1367
01:49:53,170 --> 01:49:54,501
kay!

1368
01:49:54,938 --> 01:49:56,701
-Connie!
-How are you?

1369
01:49:57,174 --> 01:49:59,608
Mary, I've missed you.

1370
01:50:00,778 --> 01:50:02,837
Hello, Michael.

1371
01:50:02,946 --> 01:50:04,743
Mom, look at this.

1372
01:50:04,848 --> 01:50:08,409

1373
01:50:08,552 --> 01:50:10,679
it's too bad Douglas couldn't come.

1374
01:50:10,788 --> 01:50:14,588
I know. He had a very important trial.

1375
01:50:14,725 --> 01:50:16,750
I know he wanted to come.

1376
01:50:17,926 --> 01:50:20,224
-The car is...
-Okay.

1377
01:50:21,799 --> 01:50:25,758
Well, your son is an artist.

1378
01:50:25,869 --> 01:50:28,394
Oh, yes. Thanks to you.

1379
01:50:28,572 --> 01:50:30,005
What for?

1380
01:50:30,607 --> 01:50:33,167
For making me let him go.

1381
01:50:33,744 --> 01:50:35,109
Well,

1382
01:50:35,212 --> 01:50:36,611
after all these years,

1383
01:50:36,713 --> 01:50:38,840
here I am in Sicily for the first time.

1384
01:50:38,949 --> 01:50:41,076
-I want to get a picture of you together.
-Okay.

1385
01:50:44,121 --> 01:50:45,884
Hey, Dad. Smile!

1386
01:50:50,327 --> 01:50:53,956
I see you still have Al Neri. Why?

1387
01:50:54,465 --> 01:50:58,526
I need him. He helps me get in and out of the car.

1388
01:50:59,169 --> 01:51:00,932
He carries my briefcase.

1389
01:51:01,271 --> 01:51:03,296
You're still a liar, Michael.

1390
01:51:04,441 --> 01:51:07,842
Let me show you Sicily, the real Sicily.

1391
01:51:07,945 --> 01:51:10,436
So you'll understand the family history.

1392
01:51:10,547 --> 01:51:13,175
I think I understand it more than enough.

1393
01:51:42,379 --> 01:51:44,006

1394
01:52:05,068 --> 01:52:06,626
Anthony,

1395
01:52:06,737 --> 01:52:12,073
I have something you made for me a very long time ago.

1396
01:52:12,776 --> 01:52:15,074
-Might bring you luck.
-Thanks.

1397
01:52:19,583 --> 01:52:21,050
You saved it...

1398
01:52:21,185 --> 01:52:23,085
I remember.

1399
01:52:27,057 --> 01:52:28,581
Thank you, Dad.

1400
01:52:30,427 --> 01:52:31,951
I'm proud of you.

1401
01:52:32,829 --> 01:52:34,091
Thank you.

1402
01:52:50,447 --> 01:52:52,506
Are they as good as they look?

1403
01:52:52,616 --> 01:52:55,642
Better. They're the best.

1404
01:52:55,986 --> 01:52:58,477
As long as they are around, Uncle Michael is safe.

1405
01:52:58,589 --> 01:53:00,682
Goodbye.

1406
01:53:02,726 --> 01:53:04,318
Tell your father I'll be back for dinner.

1407
01:53:04,428 --> 01:53:05,395
Okay.

1408
01:53:06,263 --> 01:53:07,321
Have fun.

1409
01:53:07,397 --> 01:53:09,024
Tell Tony to wait for me.

1410
01:53:09,132 --> 01:53:10,724
I will.

1411
01:53:11,969 --> 01:53:13,027

1412
01:53:13,103 --> 01:53:16,834
Buongiorno, signora. At your service.

1413
01:53:20,744 --> 01:53:23,941
if I see Dad, I'll tell him you left.

1414
01:53:28,986 --> 01:53:33,423
You're the only one left with my father's strength.

1415
01:53:34,825 --> 01:53:38,727
if anything happens to Michael, I want you to strike back.

1416
01:53:41,865 --> 01:53:44,595
I'll have everything ready.

1417
01:53:47,337 --> 01:53:48,998
Do you swear?

1418
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:58,072
I swear to you.

1419
01:54:28,512 --> 01:54:34,644
Here it is. The house where my father was born.

1420
01:54:35,585 --> 01:54:37,576
This is where they came

1421
01:54:37,688 --> 01:54:42,182
to take him when he was a boy. To kill him.

1422
01:54:44,227 --> 01:54:45,922
Wait...

1423
01:54:46,697 --> 01:54:48,392
Listen to that.

1424
01:55:07,818 --> 01:55:10,184
You know Mary's in love.

1425
01:55:11,288 --> 01:55:12,915
Yes, I know.

1426
01:55:14,124 --> 01:55:18,857
With a handsome young Italian man with dark eyes...

1427
01:55:19,429 --> 01:55:21,329
I won't allow it.

1428
01:55:23,967 --> 01:55:25,400
it's wrong.

1429
01:55:25,736 --> 01:55:28,034
it's wrong and it's dangerous.

1430
01:55:28,171 --> 01:55:31,231
"Oh father, my father!"

1431
01:55:31,341 --> 01:55:34,139
"Give me some time to pray to the Lord."

1432
01:55:34,244 --> 01:55:37,475
The Baroness of Carini had betrayed her husband...

1433
01:55:37,681 --> 01:55:41,845
and fallen in love with her cousin.

1434
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:45,444
"There will be no forgiveness!"

1435
01:55:46,456 --> 01:55:48,754
Her father stabbed her

1436
01:55:48,859 --> 01:55:52,920
through the heart.

1437
01:56:00,103 --> 01:56:01,661
Honour, huh?

1438
01:56:21,324 --> 01:56:24,452
I remember the time you came to my parents' house

1439
01:56:24,561 --> 01:56:28,463
and told me about the family business.

1440
01:56:28,565 --> 01:56:31,295
How you'd never have anything to do with it.

1441
01:56:31,468 --> 01:56:33,902
You sounded like Tony.

1442
01:56:34,104 --> 01:56:36,129
I was a lot like Tony.

1443
01:56:43,812 --> 01:56:44,938
I can barely see him...

1444
01:56:45,015 --> 01:56:46,277
-kay?
-What?

1445
01:56:46,683 --> 01:56:47,741
Do you mind driving?

1446
01:56:47,818 --> 01:56:49,080
What's wrong?

1447
01:56:49,252 --> 01:56:52,085
My eyes. Sometimes they're all right, but...

1448
01:56:54,090 --> 01:56:55,819
I have to see Don Tommasino...

1449
01:56:55,926 --> 01:56:57,257

1450
01:57:00,262 --> 01:57:02,628
Well...

1451
01:57:02,632 --> 01:57:04,395
There are no bodyguards today.

1452
01:57:04,668 --> 01:57:06,260
I really snuck away.

1453
01:57:13,376 --> 01:57:20,578
Father, where are you going? Would you like a ride?

1454
01:57:27,357 --> 01:57:29,552
I know you.

1455
01:57:29,659 --> 01:57:32,253
You're Mosca of Montelepre.

1456
01:57:32,362 --> 01:57:33,989
You were an assassin then,

1457
01:57:34,097 --> 01:57:36,190
and you're an assassin now.

1458
01:57:36,299 --> 01:57:40,235
I know Michael Corleone is at your house.

1459
01:57:40,337 --> 01:57:42,328
I will pass through the gates with you.

1460
01:57:59,422 --> 01:58:00,582
How are you?

1461
01:58:00,924 --> 01:58:04,519
This is Calo, one of my bodyguards in the old days.

1462
01:58:10,333 --> 01:58:12,733
-We can wait here.
-You want a drink?

1463
01:58:12,869 --> 01:58:14,166

1464
01:58:18,341 --> 01:58:21,037
I spent a lot of time in this room...

1465
01:58:22,412 --> 01:58:24,175
...thinking of you.

1466
01:58:27,484 --> 01:58:29,008
And then you got married.

1467
01:58:33,323 --> 01:58:34,881
I still thought of you.

1468
01:58:35,725 --> 01:58:37,352
What's in that room?

1469
01:58:41,431 --> 01:58:43,865
This is dangerous for you.

1470
01:58:43,967 --> 01:58:45,662
This is Sicily.

1471
01:58:48,038 --> 01:58:49,471
I love this country.

1472
01:58:49,573 --> 01:58:51,097
Why?

1473
01:58:53,043 --> 01:58:56,535
Well, all through history,

1474
01:58:56,646 --> 01:58:59,809
terrible things have happened to these people.

1475
01:58:59,916 --> 01:59:02,646
Terrible injustices.

1476
01:59:03,186 --> 01:59:06,212
But they still expect good,

1477
01:59:06,323 --> 01:59:08,518
rather than bad, will happen to them.

1478
01:59:08,625 --> 01:59:10,786
Sort of like me and you?

1479
01:59:14,698 --> 01:59:15,756
How so?

1480
01:59:15,832 --> 01:59:17,527
I'm still here, right?

1481
01:59:18,301 --> 01:59:20,496
We do have a bad history,

1482
01:59:20,604 --> 01:59:21,730
but I'm still here.

1483
01:59:21,838 --> 01:59:24,739
Yes, you are, but with dread.

1484
01:59:29,112 --> 01:59:31,342
Give me the order!

1485
01:59:31,448 --> 01:59:34,611
Is that supposed to make me not dread you?

1486
01:59:36,886 --> 01:59:39,184
We're in Sicily. it's opera.

1487
01:59:41,591 --> 01:59:42,853
Okay.

1488
01:59:45,495 --> 01:59:47,486
What do we do now?

1489
01:59:50,233 --> 01:59:51,928
Be reasonable.

1490
01:59:52,802 --> 01:59:54,667
Let's try not to hurt each other.

1491
02:00:01,778 --> 02:00:03,871
I want you to forgive me.

1492
02:00:06,683 --> 02:00:08,310
For what?

1493
02:00:08,918 --> 02:00:10,613
Everything.

1494
02:00:13,423 --> 02:00:16,790
Oh, like God?

1495
02:00:17,227 --> 02:00:20,788
No, I need something a little closer.

1496
02:00:22,832 --> 02:00:27,064
You couldn't understand, back in those days.

1497
02:00:27,504 --> 02:00:29,529
I loved my father.

1498
02:00:29,639 --> 02:00:32,506
I swore I would never be a man like him,

1499
02:00:32,609 --> 02:00:35,305
but I loved him and he was in danger.

1500
02:00:35,412 --> 02:00:36,902
What could I do?

1501
02:00:37,013 --> 02:00:40,471
And then later, you were in danger.

1502
02:00:40,583 --> 02:00:44,314
Our children were in danger. What could I do?

1503
02:00:44,921 --> 02:00:51,690
You were all that I... loved and valued most in the world.

1504
02:00:52,662 --> 02:00:55,859
Now I'm losing you. I lost you.

1505
02:00:55,965 --> 02:00:57,899
You're gone.

1506
02:00:58,968 --> 02:01:01,163
And it was all for nothing.

1507
02:01:01,304 --> 02:01:03,272
So...

1508
02:01:06,543 --> 02:01:12,379
You have to understand, I had a whole different destiny planned.

1509
02:01:15,218 --> 02:01:16,981
All right, I'll stop.

1510
02:01:27,597 --> 02:01:29,531
I really don't know what you want from me, Michael.

1511
02:01:29,632 --> 02:01:31,600

1512
02:01:32,001 --> 02:01:33,628
I mean...

1513
02:01:33,803 --> 02:01:37,330
I'm not the man that you think I am.

1514
02:01:37,974 --> 02:01:40,238
I don't know.

1515
02:01:40,343 --> 02:01:42,277
I love you, kay.

1516
02:01:43,279 --> 02:01:46,715
Don't dread me anymore.

1517
02:01:51,087 --> 02:01:56,855
You know, every night here in Sicily...

1518
02:01:57,060 --> 02:01:59,153
...I dream

1519
02:02:00,130 --> 02:02:03,258
about my wife and my children...

1520
02:02:05,769 --> 02:02:08,704
...and how I lost them.

1521
02:02:09,873 --> 02:02:16,676
I guess that if it's any consolation, I want you to know that...

1522
02:02:19,115 --> 02:02:24,382
that... I always loved you, Michael.

1523
02:02:25,321 --> 02:02:32,784
And you know... always, I always will.

1524
02:02:59,455 --> 02:03:00,945
What is it? What's wrong?

1525
02:03:02,392 --> 02:03:06,658
They found Don Tommasino shot.

1526
02:03:06,830 --> 02:03:08,354
Is he dead?

1527
02:03:10,667 --> 02:03:14,569
My master is dead. Blood calls for blood.

1528
02:03:14,704 --> 02:03:19,141
I must have revenge!

1529
02:03:21,010 --> 02:03:26,846
Some day, you may have to do a difficuit service for me.

1530
02:03:26,950 --> 02:03:30,408
- Command me.
- It never ends.

1531
02:03:31,554 --> 02:03:34,648
I will avenge him!

1532
02:03:48,838 --> 02:03:50,533
Totals...

1533
02:03:52,375 --> 02:03:55,344
Lorscheider, 1 vote.

1534
02:03:55,678 --> 02:03:59,170
Siri, 11 votes.

1535
02:03:59,282 --> 02:04:03,343
Lamberto, 99 votes.

1536
02:04:08,157 --> 02:04:11,524
Do you accept your election

1537
02:04:11,628 --> 02:04:13,960
as supreme pontiff?

1538
02:04:14,097 --> 02:04:20,127
Oh God, shed light on the decision they have taken on my behaif.

1539
02:04:20,503 --> 02:04:22,334
I accept.

1540
02:04:22,505 --> 02:04:25,030
By what name do you wish to be called?

1541
02:04:25,141 --> 02:04:28,599
John Paul the First.

1542
02:04:58,274 --> 02:05:00,367
I will do things "right away,"

1543
02:05:00,476 --> 02:05:04,640
rather than in "a little while"...

1544
02:05:04,781 --> 02:05:12,017
Frederick keinszig, known as "God's Banker", has been reported missing.

1545
02:05:12,155 --> 02:05:17,457
He was last seen leaving the Rome offices of Vatican owned Immobiliare.

1546
02:05:17,593 --> 02:05:21,393
Also missing was a large sum of money and several documents.

1547
02:05:21,497 --> 02:05:26,161
keinszig, you fool.

1548
02:05:28,104 --> 02:05:30,072
His absence casts

1549
02:05:30,173 --> 02:05:33,074
further suspicion on the dealings of the Vatican Bank.

1550
02:05:33,176 --> 02:05:36,043
For several years, the bank and its companies

1551
02:05:36,145 --> 02:05:41,742
have been the object of allegations of disreputable business practices.

1552
02:05:41,851 --> 02:05:46,220
Lucchesi, will you please try to understand?

1553
02:05:47,156 --> 02:05:48,919
I have phoned him.

1554
02:05:49,025 --> 02:05:51,357
I have waited here by the phone.

1555
02:05:54,464 --> 02:05:58,423
You would do well to remember, Mr Lucchesi,

1556
02:05:58,534 --> 02:06:01,002
that this Pope

1557
02:06:01,104 --> 02:06:06,098
has very different ideas from the last one.

1558
02:06:27,397 --> 02:06:29,729
Goodbye, my old friend.

1559
02:06:32,001 --> 02:06:34,367
You could have lived a little longer.

1560
02:06:35,638 --> 02:06:38,869
I could be closer to my dream.

1561
02:06:44,380 --> 02:06:47,281
You were so loved, Don Tommasino.

1562
02:06:51,888 --> 02:06:54,288
Why was I so feared,

1563
02:06:54,390 --> 02:06:56,517
and you so loved?

1564
02:06:56,893 --> 02:06:58,724
What was it?

1565
02:06:59,529 --> 02:07:02,020
I was no less honourable.

1566
02:07:03,766 --> 02:07:06,462
I wanted to do good.

1567
02:07:09,972 --> 02:07:11,166
What betrayed me?

1568
02:07:11,274 --> 02:07:14,107
My mind? My heart?

1569
02:07:15,878 --> 02:07:19,041
Why do I condemn myself so?

1570
02:07:24,954 --> 02:07:26,979
I swear,

1571
02:07:27,156 --> 02:07:30,250
on the lives of my children...

1572
02:07:33,896 --> 02:07:37,957
Give me a chance to redeem myself...

1573
02:07:40,603 --> 02:07:45,097
...and I will sin no more.

1574
02:08:08,364 --> 02:08:11,231
You look pale. Bad news?

1575
02:08:11,334 --> 02:08:12,858
Tell me right away.

1576
02:08:14,303 --> 02:08:16,771
it's not just a bad banking deal.

1577
02:08:18,040 --> 02:08:20,065
These guys are butchers.

1578
02:08:21,177 --> 02:08:23,042
What guys?

1579
02:08:23,146 --> 02:08:24,807
Lucchesi.

1580
02:08:25,681 --> 02:08:27,114
He controls all of them:

1581
02:08:27,216 --> 02:08:28,774
Altobello,

1582
02:08:28,885 --> 02:08:30,785
the Archbishop...

1583
02:08:31,420 --> 02:08:34,253
...others higher up, P2 maybe.

1584
02:08:34,390 --> 02:08:36,290
Secret unknown.

1585
02:08:36,425 --> 02:08:38,325
They're running things.

1586
02:08:41,030 --> 02:08:42,463
I'm in their way.

1587
02:08:43,833 --> 02:08:46,358
He's hired an assassin to kill you.

1588
02:08:46,469 --> 02:08:47,959
A Sicilian.

1589
02:08:48,070 --> 02:08:49,833
I don't know his name.

1590
02:08:51,140 --> 02:08:53,165
But they say he never fails.

1591
02:08:54,610 --> 02:08:56,635
Then no one is safe.

1592
02:08:59,549 --> 02:09:02,575
Even the new Pope is in danger.

1593
02:09:03,219 --> 02:09:07,451
We still have time. We can prevent this.

1594
02:09:11,460 --> 02:09:13,121
I tried, Vincent.

1595
02:09:15,932 --> 02:09:17,957
I tried...

1596
02:09:19,001 --> 02:09:21,902
...to keep everything from coming to this.

1597
02:09:22,138 --> 02:09:24,766
But it's not possible.

1598
02:09:24,874 --> 02:09:27,843
Not in this world.

1599
02:09:28,177 --> 02:09:30,372
Give me the order.

1600
02:09:33,683 --> 02:09:35,742
You won't be able to go back.

1601
02:09:37,019 --> 02:09:38,543
You'll be like me.

1602
02:09:38,688 --> 02:09:40,246
Good.

1603
02:09:40,923 --> 02:09:43,619
All my life I wanted out.

1604
02:09:43,793 --> 02:09:47,024
I wanted the family out.

1605
02:09:47,930 --> 02:09:50,262
I don't want out.

1606
02:09:50,399 --> 02:09:53,027
I want the power to preserve the family.

1607
02:09:57,740 --> 02:10:00,334
I'm asking for the order.

1608
02:10:20,830 --> 02:10:22,491
it's done.

1609
02:10:24,133 --> 02:10:26,829
Because I can't do it anymore.

1610
02:10:31,240 --> 02:10:32,605
Well, it doesn't matter.

1611
02:10:32,708 --> 02:10:36,007
Vincent knows what to do. Come on outside.

1612
02:10:36,112 --> 02:10:39,639
Take a rest and don't think about it.

1613
02:10:39,749 --> 02:10:41,239
All I do is think about it.

1614
02:10:41,350 --> 02:10:43,113
I'm your son.

1615
02:10:43,786 --> 02:10:46,118
Command me in all things.

1616
02:10:48,124 --> 02:10:50,524
Give up my daughter.

1617
02:10:53,062 --> 02:10:55,189
That's the price you pay...

1618
02:10:56,365 --> 02:10:58,663
...for the life you choose.

1619
02:11:24,927 --> 02:11:26,417
Nephew...

1620
02:11:28,664 --> 02:11:30,928
...from this moment on...

1621
02:11:32,401 --> 02:11:34,995
...call yourself Vincent Corleone.

1622
02:11:39,775 --> 02:11:42,835
Sit.

1623
02:11:56,225 --> 02:11:57,954
Don Vincenzo...

1624
02:12:00,062 --> 02:12:01,757

1625
02:12:03,699 --> 02:12:05,564
Don Corleone...

1626
02:12:08,871 --> 02:12:11,567
Don Vincenzo Corleone...

1627
02:12:59,889 --> 02:13:01,083

1628
02:13:24,413 --> 02:13:26,779

1629
02:13:44,733 --> 02:13:47,133
E tu, Vincenzo...

1630
02:13:47,269 --> 02:13:50,136
I know how you feel about Michael,

1631
02:13:50,239 --> 02:13:52,469
but you can't save him.

1632
02:13:52,708 --> 02:13:54,608
He's lost.

1633
02:13:55,678 --> 02:13:57,976
Think of yourself.

1634
02:13:58,647 --> 02:14:01,275
What's your answer, Vincent?

1635
02:14:03,085 --> 02:14:05,451
Enjoy the opera.

1636
02:14:06,956 --> 02:14:08,947
it's all taken care of.

1637
02:14:14,363 --> 02:14:16,888
Check the bar. I'll check the top floor.

1638
02:14:20,970 --> 02:14:23,962
"Here's hoping Tony sings better at the Teatro Massimo

1639
02:14:24,106 --> 02:14:25,573
than in the shower."

1640
02:14:25,539 --> 02:14:27,564
"Love, Douglas."

1641
02:14:27,843 --> 02:14:30,175
My darling Constanza!

1642
02:14:30,479 --> 02:14:32,174
Don Altobello.

1643
02:14:32,281 --> 02:14:33,942
This is a great occasion.

1644
02:14:34,049 --> 02:14:35,676
Come, sit down.

1645
02:14:39,755 --> 02:14:41,620
Happy birthday.

1646
02:14:42,024 --> 02:14:44,492
You're 80, but don't look more than 60.

1647
02:14:44,593 --> 02:14:46,754
You're the only one who remembered.

1648
02:14:46,862 --> 02:14:50,491
We've just got the word. The Pope has ratified the Immobiliare deal.

1649
02:14:50,599 --> 02:14:51,861
We've won.

1650
02:14:52,067 --> 02:14:53,728
Congratulations.

1651
02:14:56,705 --> 02:14:59,105
Strange how things work.

1652
02:14:59,208 --> 02:15:00,937
The Pope is doing what you said he'd do.

1653
02:15:01,043 --> 02:15:02,510
He's cleaning house.

1654
02:15:03,679 --> 02:15:05,909
He should be careful.

1655
02:15:06,081 --> 02:15:07,776
it's dangerous to be an honest man.

1656
02:15:14,557 --> 02:15:17,287
I want to put more muscle backstage with Tony.

1657
02:15:29,505 --> 02:15:32,838
On your birthday you used to shower me with treats.

1658
02:15:32,975 --> 02:15:34,533
Tootsie Rolls!

1659
02:15:35,644 --> 02:15:39,102
The nuns who made this cannoli took a vow of silence.

1660
02:15:39,214 --> 02:15:41,045
They're the very finest.

1661
02:15:46,822 --> 02:15:48,289
Hey, cous.

1662
02:15:51,493 --> 02:15:53,051
Where's your leather?

1663
02:15:56,432 --> 02:15:57,899
Stop it.

1664
02:16:03,906 --> 02:16:08,240
You're so thin. You eat it.

1665
02:16:23,859 --> 02:16:29,661
E buono. Grazie!

1666
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:32,331
it's over.

1667
02:16:32,434 --> 02:16:35,403
There are things I have to do that you can't be part of.

1668
02:16:35,504 --> 02:16:39,838
it's not your father's decision, it's mine.

1669
02:16:40,175 --> 02:16:42,234
Don't hate your father.

1670
02:16:44,613 --> 02:16:49,107
There are things I'll be part of that you can't be around.

1671
02:16:50,185 --> 02:16:53,313
After tonight, you won't see me anymore.

1672
02:16:53,856 --> 02:16:55,551

1673
02:16:57,359 --> 02:17:00,886
You've got to understand, Mary. You've got to understand.

1674
02:17:02,031 --> 02:17:04,124
I'll always love you.

1675
02:17:16,812 --> 02:17:19,440
Love somebody else.

1676
02:17:41,370 --> 02:17:43,702

1677
02:20:59,935 --> 02:21:01,368
They won't try anything.

1678
02:21:01,470 --> 02:21:03,199
Everything's fine. it's all clear.

1679
02:21:03,972 --> 02:21:06,668
I've already sent Al Neri to the Vatican.

1680
02:21:18,954 --> 02:21:22,890
Mr. Lucchesi's house?

1681
02:21:23,292 --> 02:21:28,127
I bring a message from Michael Corleone.

1682
02:21:28,897 --> 02:21:30,922
Let him in.

1683
02:22:59,488 --> 02:23:00,853
Buona sera.

1684
02:26:22,389 --> 02:26:25,017
Good. You got him.

1685
02:27:16,611 --> 02:27:19,546
Tonight the Corleone family settles its accounts.

1686
02:27:20,315 --> 02:27:22,044
keinszig...

1687
02:27:22,617 --> 02:27:25,916
That little Swiss banker fuck.

1688
02:27:26,187 --> 02:27:31,022
He's been swindling everyone from the beginning. Fuck him.

1689
02:27:31,626 --> 02:27:34,322
Don Lucchesi, my friend.

1690
02:27:34,429 --> 02:27:38,661
Calo will pay him a visit at his home.

1691
02:27:39,768 --> 02:27:41,292
Neri,

1692
02:27:41,636 --> 02:27:43,604
take a train to Rome.

1693
02:27:44,673 --> 02:27:47,506
Light a candle for the Archbishop.

1694
02:28:23,244 --> 02:28:27,203
Tea, Your Holiness? it will help you sleep.

1695
02:28:48,970 --> 02:28:51,939
This is from Vincent Corleone.

1696
02:29:50,298 --> 02:29:55,292
it's serious. Our man inside the Vatican says there's a plot against the Pope.

1697
02:29:55,403 --> 02:29:58,133
He'll have a heart attack?

1698
02:30:04,512 --> 02:30:07,003
This Pope has powerful enemies.

1699
02:30:07,115 --> 02:30:10,243
We may not be in time to save him.

1700
02:30:12,654 --> 02:30:14,679
Let's go back.

1701
02:30:48,923 --> 02:30:50,515
Eminenza...

1702
02:30:56,197 --> 02:31:01,191

1703
02:31:04,405 --> 02:31:09,502
The Holy Father is dead!

1704
02:32:39,067 --> 02:32:40,432
Sleep.

1705
02:32:41,302 --> 02:32:43,600
Sleep, Godfather.

1706
02:33:53,541 --> 02:33:55,566
Speak...tell me.

1707
02:33:55,677 --> 02:34:01,115
You have lost

1708
02:34:01,215 --> 02:34:03,581
the faith of the people.

1709
02:34:05,019 --> 02:34:08,716
He who builds on the people builds on mud.

1710
02:34:09,323 --> 02:34:14,351
And Michael Corleone's message?

1711
02:34:28,376 --> 02:34:33,541
it's very important.

1712
02:34:33,681 --> 02:34:37,879
I must whisper it in your ear.

1713
02:34:40,922 --> 02:34:43,015
He's clean.

1714
02:35:00,708 --> 02:35:03,506
Power wears out those who don't have it.

1715
02:36:32,300 --> 02:36:34,666
-I like this outfit.
-I figured you would.

1716
02:36:34,802 --> 02:36:36,963
Say hello.

1717
02:36:59,460 --> 02:37:00,859
Can I talk to you now?

1718
02:37:00,962 --> 02:37:03,123
No, it's not a good time.

1719
02:37:03,297 --> 02:37:04,491
You're just like my father.

1720
02:37:04,532 --> 02:37:07,365
Stay with the family. Go on.

1721
02:37:08,736 --> 02:37:10,636
-Talk to me.
-The twins are dead.

1722
02:37:10,738 --> 02:37:14,504
in about one minute, there will be carabinieri all over this place.

1723
02:37:15,710 --> 02:37:20,477
Get everybody to the cars, quietly.

1724
02:37:35,229 --> 02:37:38,630
The name Corleone will be associated with a voice.

1725
02:37:48,075 --> 02:37:49,474
Dad...

1726
02:38:09,430 --> 02:38:13,423
Dad... Why are you doing this to me?

1727
02:38:22,410 --> 02:38:25,470
Move back, move back.

1728
02:38:25,613 --> 02:38:27,979
You don't have to do this to me.

1729
02:38:28,082 --> 02:38:34,021
Do what? What do you mean?

1730
02:38:56,610 --> 02:38:58,635
Dad...

1731
02:39:08,456 --> 02:39:14,452

1732
02:39:14,862 --> 02:39:19,026
No! Mary!

1733
02:39:19,133 --> 02:39:23,263
God, no!
