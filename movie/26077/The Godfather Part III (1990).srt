1
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,049
My dear children...

2
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,357
it is now better
than several years...

3
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:55,624
since I moved to New York...

4
00:01:55,732 --> 00:01:58,428
and I haven't seen you
as much as I would like to.

5
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:04,063
I hope you will come
to this ceremony of papal honors...

6
00:02:04,174 --> 00:02:06,062
given for my charitable work.

7
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,969
The only wealth
in this world is children.

8
00:02:12,082 --> 00:02:16,041
More than all the money,
power on earth...

9
00:02:16,152 --> 00:02:18,040
you are my treasure.

10
00:02:20,256 --> 00:02:22,588
Anthony and Mary...

11
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:25,024
although I entrusted
your education to your mother...

12
00:02:25,128 --> 00:02:27,494
for your own best interests...

13
00:02:27,597 --> 00:02:30,088
you know how I look forward
to seeing you...

14
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,260
and to a new period
of harmony in our lives.

15
00:02:34,704 --> 00:02:37,264
Perhaps you might
prevail upon your mother...

16
00:02:37,374 --> 00:02:39,672
to come to this celebration...

17
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:42,301
and that from time to time...

18
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:46,200
we can all see each other
at family functions.

19
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:50,980
Anyway, I remain,
your loving father.

20
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,880
Hail Mary, full of grace...

21
00:03:26,756 --> 00:03:28,747
blessed art Thou amongst women...

22
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:34,222
and blessed is the fruit
of Thy womb,Jesus.

23
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,163
Holy Mary, mother of God...

24
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:39,633
pray for us sinners--

25
00:04:03,226 --> 00:04:06,582
Almighty God,
bless the insignia...

26
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:09,256
of Saint Sebastian the Martyr...

27
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:13,654
that it may contribute
to the sacredness of him...

28
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,692
to whom it is given.

29
00:04:28,118 --> 00:04:30,006
Do you, Michael...

30
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,248
promise to be faithful
to the noble purposes...

31
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,278
of this order...

32
00:04:35,391 --> 00:04:38,519
to have a special care
for the poor, the needy...

33
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:40,391
and those who are ill?

34
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:42,294
l do so promise.

35
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,636
May the blessing
of Almighty God--

36
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:05,710
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit--

37
00:05:05,822 --> 00:05:09,986
descend upon you
and remain with you...

38
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:11,458
forever.

39
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,188
Amen.

40
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:46,579
Vincent, our name's
not on the list.

41
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:51,423
Write it in.

42
00:06:51,527 --> 00:06:54,018
Mancini. M-A-N-C-l-N-l.

43
00:06:55,798 --> 00:06:58,426
- ls there a problem?
- My name's not on the list.

44
00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:00,957
Then you have to
leave immediately.

45
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,368
- No two ways about it.
- You want to dance?

46
00:07:03,473 --> 00:07:06,169
Joe, it's Vinnie.
lt's okay. These are our guests.

47
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,409
l'm sorry, Dave.

48
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,400
lt's all right.
Vinnie, welcome to the party.

49
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:05,733
Good to see you.

50
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:08,690
lt's good to see you again.
This is my husband.

51
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:10,693
This is my son, Anthony.

52
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:14,697
The order of Saint Sebastian
is one of the highest honors...

53
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:16,836
the Catholic Church
can bestow upon a layman.

54
00:08:16,946 --> 00:08:19,744
The award was first granted
by Pope Gregory--

55
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:22,773
What about Mr. Corleone's connections
with Las Vegas gambling?

56
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:25,217
Press kits have pictures--

57
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:27,482
How about his involvement
with the underworld?

58
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,080
Cut the crap, huh?

59
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:32,423
The pope,
the Holy Father himself...

60
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:35,224
has this very day
blessed Michael Corleone.

61
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:37,219
You think you know
better than the pope?

62
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,221
- Do it, do it.
- Vincent!

63
00:08:39,335 --> 00:08:41,724
- Yes?
- She loves you.

64
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:48,333
- What'd he say?
- l love you too.

65
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,977
Hi, Vincent.
l remember you.

66
00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:00,679
You remember me?
From where?

67
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,179
When we were at
a party together.

68
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,180
Did you come to the club?

69
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,785
- No, it was a wedding.
- A wedding?

70
00:09:08,898 --> 00:09:12,390
l was eight, and you were 1 5.

71
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:15,528
l had a lot of girlfriends
when l was 1 5.

72
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,833
- Eight-year-olds?
- Especially eight-year-olds.

73
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,103
Where's Mary?

74
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:24,600
Would somebody please hail Mary?

75
00:09:24,714 --> 00:09:26,909
Excuse me, Your Excellency.

76
00:09:27,016 --> 00:09:29,940
You know, you haven't
kissed me hello yet.

77
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:33,180
- Relatives always kiss.
- Oh, now we're related?

78
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:35,814
l'm your little cousin.

79
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,561
Who's your father?

80
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,363
l'll give you a hint.

81
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,995
- He's ltalian.
- Mary.

82
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:52,961
Mary, we've been
waiting for you.

83
00:09:53,075 --> 00:09:55,168
Remember...

84
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:57,075
keep your voice low.

85
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,705
Smile. Don't forget to smile.

86
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:19,264
Carissimi Amici...

87
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,256
the honorary chairman...

88
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,634
of the Vito Corleone
Foundation...

89
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:26,367
my daughter, Mary Corleone.

90
00:10:36,118 --> 00:10:37,073
Thanks.

91
00:10:38,754 --> 00:10:42,679
l think l inherited my father's love
for speechmaking...

92
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:44,225
but here it goes.

93
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,282
The Vito Corleone Foundation...

94
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,990
helps the impoverished
of every country...

95
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:52,488
gives grants to artists...

96
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:54,900
funds medical research...

97
00:10:55,004 --> 00:10:59,737
and is particularly dedicated
to the resurrection of Sicily.

98
00:10:59,842 --> 00:11:02,174
Archbishop Gilday...

99
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:06,703
here is $ 1 00 million
for the poor of Sicily...

100
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:09,011
in the name of Vito Corleone.

101
00:11:09,118 --> 00:11:11,916
Don't spend it all in one place.

102
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:35,636
l'm so proud of you.

103
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:47,143
You've done a wonderful thing
for Sicily.

104
00:11:47,256 --> 00:11:51,283
Let's just hope the money
gets to the people who need it.

105
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:55,160
- Amen.
- But the most important part--

106
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:57,186
Johnny Fontane!

107
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,905
Thank you very much.

108
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,899
l'm happy to be here with you,
and l'd like you to join me...

109
00:12:11,013 --> 00:12:14,642
in honoring
commendatore Michael Corleone.

110
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:22,478
l have something special
for our host and godfather.

111
00:12:22,592 --> 00:12:25,117
l just happen to know
his favorite song.

112
00:12:25,227 --> 00:12:27,149
Michael, where are you going?
lt's your favorite song.

113
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,687
l'm off here to the kitchen
to hear some Tony Bennett records.

114
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:34,767
It's your favorite song.
It's salsiccia's own.

115
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,701
We're getting
a salsiccia sandwich.

116
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:38,239
l'll be back.

117
00:12:42,578 --> 00:12:45,467
A rose must remain

118
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:48,141
With the sun and the rain

119
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:53,040
Or its lovely promise
won't come true

120
00:12:54,223 --> 00:12:56,987
To each his own

121
00:12:57,093 --> 00:13:01,223
To each his own

122
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,925
And my own is you

123
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:14,700
Hello, Kay.

124
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,614
Congratulations, Michael.
That's really quite an honor.

125
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,647
lt's a little expensive,
wouldn't you say?

126
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:35,251
Cake?

127
00:13:35,364 --> 00:13:37,025
No, thank you.

128
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,569
- Been a long time, hasn't it?
- Yeah.

129
00:13:53,683 --> 00:13:56,072
Eight years.

130
00:13:56,185 --> 00:13:58,073
You look wonderful.

131
00:14:01,857 --> 00:14:04,223
Your son has something
he wants to talk to you about.

132
00:14:04,326 --> 00:14:06,658
l came here for him.

133
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:11,019
Nice to see you.
Thank you.

134
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,271
If a flame is to grow

135
00:14:18,374 --> 00:14:21,730
There must be a glow

136
00:14:21,844 --> 00:14:24,438
To open each door

137
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:27,277
There's a key

138
00:14:27,383 --> 00:14:30,238
I need you, I know

139
00:14:30,352 --> 00:14:32,980
I can't let you go

140
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,990
- What's wrong with being a lawyer?
- Nothing, except he doesn't want it.

141
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,989
He wants his life
to be in music.

142
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,759
Music is great.
l love music...

143
00:14:50,873 --> 00:14:53,262
but he should finish
what he started.

144
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,976
- l'm going my own way.
- Your own way?

145
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,707
- Professional singer?
- That's right.

146
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:03,239
And what happens if you fail?

147
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:05,274
l won't fail.

148
00:15:05,387 --> 00:15:07,719
- Men always believe that.
- l know.

149
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,711
lf you have a law degree...

150
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,713
you're taking out
insurance.

151
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,852
After that, you can do anything--
work for me--

152
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:16,158
l will never work for you.

153
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:18,096
l have bad memories.

154
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:23,164
Every family has bad memories.

155
00:15:26,976 --> 00:15:29,069
l will always be your son...

156
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:33,740
but l will never have anything
to do with your business.

157
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:37,706
Anthony, finish the law degree.

158
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:01,696
That he got from you,
that ''no.''

159
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:07,710
You could have helped me
to convince him, Kay.

160
00:16:07,817 --> 00:16:09,705
Oh, yeah.
Convince him of what?

161
00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:12,310
Of what?

162
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,152
He throws his life away.

163
00:16:15,257 --> 00:16:17,213
He throws greatness away.

164
00:16:18,294 --> 00:16:21,252
This is greatness?

165
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:23,251
Now that you're
so respectable...

166
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:25,731
l think you're more dangerous
than you ever were.

167
00:16:25,835 --> 00:16:27,791
ln fact, l preferred you
when you were just...

168
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,235
a common Mafia hood.

169
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:37,065
- Now can we talk common sense here?
- All right.

170
00:16:43,886 --> 00:16:46,844
Tony knows that you killed Fredo.

171
00:16:53,128 --> 00:16:56,484
- What did you come here for?
- To protect my son.

172
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:59,193
l didn't come to see you disguised
by your church.

173
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:01,690
l think that was
a shameful ceremony.

174
00:17:05,975 --> 00:17:08,773
l spent my life
protecting my son.

175
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:12,769
l spent my life
protecting my family!

176
00:17:12,882 --> 00:17:15,771
Let's be reasonable.

177
00:17:15,885 --> 00:17:19,673
That's your big thing,
isn't it, Michael?

178
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:23,952
Reason backed up by murder.

179
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,720
Oh, God.

180
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:29,556
God, you hate me. You hate me.

181
00:17:30,332 --> 00:17:32,425
l don't hate you.

182
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:35,068
l dread you.

183
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,899
l did what l could, Kay, to protect...

184
00:17:43,012 --> 00:17:45,674
all of you from the horrors
of this world.

185
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:48,970
But you became my horror.

186
00:17:58,761 --> 00:18:01,093
Our children still love you, though.

187
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:02,891
Especially Mary.

188
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:07,159
That's something.

189
00:18:09,705 --> 00:18:13,527
We can build on that,
for their sake.

190
00:18:17,313 --> 00:18:18,940
Let's try.

191
00:18:19,048 --> 00:18:22,279
Only if you let Tony go free
to have his own life...

192
00:18:23,385 --> 00:18:24,511
away from you.

193
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,648
l'll let Tony go.

194
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:37,792
Thank you.

195
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:18,294
You could hurt somebody
with those.

196
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,664
Let me show you around.

197
00:19:21,777 --> 00:19:24,143
Can you get me an interview
with Michael Corleone?

198
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,101
No. l'm a relative,
but l can't do that.

199
00:19:27,216 --> 00:19:29,844
What else could l do for you?

200
00:19:29,952 --> 00:19:32,546
- Handsome but useless.
- Oh, yeah?

201
00:19:32,654 --> 00:19:35,851
- That's okay. l'll gamble.
- You like to gamble?

202
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:39,985
Let's go to Atlantic City. lt's my town.
l'll show you how to gamble.

203
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,461
How will l know
what numbers to bet?

204
00:19:42,564 --> 00:19:44,327
Do l look like a loser?

205
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,923
Well--

206
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:50,760
That's a spooky-looking
guy there.

207
00:19:50,873 --> 00:19:54,400
What's a guy like that doing
at Michael Corleone's house?

208
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,842
- That's Joey Zasa's bulldog.
- You know that guy?

209
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,072
Yeah, l know that guy.

210
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:02,070
That guy's name
is Anthony Squigiliaro.

211
00:20:02,184 --> 00:20:04,106
They call him ''the Ant.''

212
00:20:04,219 --> 00:20:07,552
He dips his bullets in cyanide.

213
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:17,460
Don Altobello.

214
00:20:19,101 --> 00:20:21,490
l come to pay my respects.

215
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:28,431
You honor my father's friendship.

216
00:20:28,544 --> 00:20:30,705
Where is my goddaughter?

217
00:20:35,384 --> 00:20:39,650
lt was not so long ago
l held you in these old hands.

218
00:20:45,127 --> 00:20:47,755
No, no.
l stand. l stand.

219
00:20:47,863 --> 00:20:51,287
Michael, l lost
all the venom...

220
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,288
all the juice of youth.

221
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:55,427
l lost the lust
for women...

222
00:20:55,537 --> 00:20:59,029
and now my mind is clear.

223
00:20:59,141 --> 00:21:02,030
My duty to God is clear.

224
00:21:02,144 --> 00:21:05,534
l have a special favor to ask.

225
00:21:07,216 --> 00:21:11,448
Can l attach my name...

226
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:14,442
to the Vito Corleone Foundation...

227
00:21:14,556 --> 00:21:17,286
so that you and l can be joined...

228
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:20,088
in name and spirit?

229
00:21:22,431 --> 00:21:24,126
One million dollars.

230
00:21:30,272 --> 00:21:32,695
- Godfather.
- Don Altobello...

231
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:34,696
you have such a heart.

232
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,840
Come, let's go
and sample some of it.

233
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:51,548
The Vatican knows nothing
about these shareholders.

234
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:55,050
Good.
l have a tendency to worry.

235
00:21:55,164 --> 00:21:57,962
We've increased our position
substantially...

236
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,226
and naturally, l worry.

237
00:21:59,334 --> 00:22:00,961
Come along now.
Stop worrying.

238
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,458
We have an agreement.

239
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,234
Good. How do you think
l got this gray hair?

240
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:07,638
Mr. Corleone.

241
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,802
- Two seconds.
- Frank, how are you?

242
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:12,403
Thanks for your swimming pool
contribution...

243
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:16,746
and we need your help on
Sam Wallace's candidacy for a judgeship.

244
00:22:16,852 --> 00:22:19,082
- We always can use a good judge.
- Thank you.

245
00:22:19,188 --> 00:22:21,053
Andrew.

246
00:22:21,156 --> 00:22:23,488
Excellency, my godson,
Andrew Hagen...

247
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,480
my brother Tom Hagen's
eldest boy...

248
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,984
and he's been assistant
to Bishop Breelan three years now.

249
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,429
He's hoping for
a Vatican assignment.

250
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:34,127
There's always a place in Rome
for a fine priest.

251
00:22:34,236 --> 00:22:36,659
His mother, Theresa Hagen.
Bishop Gilday.

252
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,434
Thank you.
lt's an honor to meet you.

253
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:44,001
Mr. Corleone, hi.
Grace Hamilton.

254
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,603
Vincent Mancini promised
he'd tell you about me...

255
00:22:46,682 --> 00:22:48,946
that maybe you'd see me.

256
00:22:49,051 --> 00:22:50,814
Vincent Mancini call about her?

257
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:52,318
No.

258
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:54,753
Grace, you promised me
you'd stay up there.

259
00:22:54,856 --> 00:22:56,721
- l know.
- Twice.

260
00:22:57,726 --> 00:23:01,548
Joey Zasa showed up.
We got him waiting in the lobby.

261
00:23:01,663 --> 00:23:05,690
Says he wants to personally
congratulate you and show his respect.

262
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,723
Do l have to see him?

263
00:23:07,836 --> 00:23:11,033
He says you're his padrone
and he only wants a minute.

264
00:23:14,576 --> 00:23:17,306
Hey, Vinnie.

265
00:23:17,412 --> 00:23:19,573
- Who's your favorite aunt?
- You are.

266
00:23:22,684 --> 00:23:26,848
Today l'm going to talk to Michael
about your problem.

267
00:23:26,955 --> 00:23:29,685
l wish you would have warned me, Con.
l could have worn a better suit.

268
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:34,719
The Meucci Association
has elected you...

269
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,685
their ltalian-American
man of the year.

270
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,497
Hey, Meucci.

271
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,995
Who's Meucci?

272
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,741
He's the ltalian-American
who invented the telephone.

273
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:52,234
He did it one year before
Alexander Graham Bell.

274
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,269
Really? Huh.

275
00:23:56,318 --> 00:23:59,276
And this is the reason
you've come to my home?

276
00:24:10,766 --> 00:24:13,360
l got a stone in my shoe,
Mr. Corleone.

277
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:17,697
A two-bit punk
who works for me...

278
00:24:17,806 --> 00:24:19,899
the one who...

279
00:24:20,008 --> 00:24:21,999
thinks he's related to you.

280
00:24:23,812 --> 00:24:25,700
A bastard.

281
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:32,179
He's here.
Vincent Mancini.

282
00:24:32,287 --> 00:24:33,618
He's at the party.

283
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:38,657
Bring him in.

284
00:24:39,928 --> 00:24:43,284
l think it's good we talk.

285
00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:49,501
l have a problem...

286
00:24:49,604 --> 00:24:53,768
and l want to find out
if it is my problem...

287
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:56,002
or your problem.

288
00:24:56,111 --> 00:24:58,033
Your business is your business.

289
00:24:58,146 --> 00:25:00,478
l have no interest
in percentages.

290
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,742
l'm out.

291
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,546
Good.

292
00:25:04,653 --> 00:25:06,541
Then it's my problem.

293
00:25:09,991 --> 00:25:14,155
Michael, you know
Vincent Mancini, Sonny's boy.

294
00:25:16,565 --> 00:25:18,624
How you doing, Mr. Corleone?

295
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:20,929
- How you doing?
- Good. How you doing?

296
00:25:21,036 --> 00:25:22,594
- Good.
- Good party.

297
00:25:22,704 --> 00:25:24,797
- Oh, you like it.
- Yeah. l had to sneak in.

298
00:25:24,906 --> 00:25:26,794
You're dressed for it.

299
00:25:31,346 --> 00:25:32,438
So...

300
00:25:32,547 --> 00:25:35,710
what's the trouble
between you and Mr.Joe Zasa?

301
00:25:37,652 --> 00:25:39,540
Just trouble.
l'll take care of it.

302
00:25:39,654 --> 00:25:43,750
- That's foolish of you.
- Foolish of me?

303
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:46,020
lt's foolish of this guy,
don't you think?

304
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:48,358
Right?

305
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,385
Right?

306
00:25:50,499 --> 00:25:52,524
Temper like his father.

307
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,192
Vincent...

308
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:58,301
Mr.Joe Zasa now owns
what used to be...

309
00:25:58,407 --> 00:26:01,171
the Corleone family
business in New York.

310
00:26:01,276 --> 00:26:05,508
Out of the kindness of his heart,
he gave you a job in his family.

311
00:26:05,614 --> 00:26:08,469
Contrary to my advice,
you took the job.

312
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:12,178
l offered you something better
in the legitimate world.

313
00:26:12,287 --> 00:26:13,686
You turned me down.

314
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:17,577
Now you both come to me
with this bad blood.

315
00:26:17,692 --> 00:26:19,489
What do you expect me to do?

316
00:26:19,594 --> 00:26:22,222
Am l a gangster?

317
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,252
- No. You're not a gangster.
- That was Papa's neighborhood.

318
00:26:24,366 --> 00:26:27,221
Now it's a sewer.
Zasa runs it like a disgrace.

319
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,768
That's the past.

320
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,065
l earned that territory
with my talent.

321
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:35,064
The commission gave it to me,
and you approved it.

322
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:38,738
- Yes.
- l came to the party.

323
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,838
l'm not here for help.
l could kill this bastard.

324
00:26:40,949 --> 00:26:43,782
- He needs the help.
- So kill him.

325
00:26:43,885 --> 00:26:47,343
What does all this
have to do with me?

326
00:26:47,456 --> 00:26:50,516
He's going around behind your back
saying, ''Fuck Michael Corleone.''

327
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:52,786
That's one thing
that has to do with you. Right?

328
00:26:52,894 --> 00:26:55,419
Say it to his face one time.
Just one time.

329
00:26:57,132 --> 00:27:00,090
Mr. Corleone,
all bastards are liars.

330
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:04,832
- Shakespeare wrote poems about it.
- What am l gonna do with this guy?

331
00:27:13,415 --> 00:27:16,339
lf there is some guy
running around this city...

332
00:27:16,451 --> 00:27:18,817
saying, ''Fuck Michael Corleone''...

333
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:23,448
what do we do with a piece of shit
like that?

334
00:27:26,094 --> 00:27:27,584
He's a fucking dog.

335
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:38,660
Yes, it's true.
lf anyone would say such a thing...

336
00:27:38,773 --> 00:27:42,368
they would not be a friend,
they would be a dog.

337
00:27:48,483 --> 00:27:50,815
My interests don't conflict
with Mr.Joe Zasa's.

338
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,741
You don't know how much your interests
conflict with Zasa's, Uncle Michael.

339
00:27:54,856 --> 00:27:58,553
Wait.
He needs your support.

340
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,389
Don't let me work
for this guy no more.

341
00:28:00,495 --> 00:28:02,417
- Let me work for you.
- For me?

342
00:28:02,531 --> 00:28:04,260
As what? Tough guy?

343
00:28:04,366 --> 00:28:06,254
l don't need tough guys.

344
00:28:06,368 --> 00:28:08,290
l need more lawyers.

345
00:28:10,805 --> 00:28:13,603
Since we have no
conflicts, no debts...

346
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:15,573
l accept your tribute.

347
00:28:15,677 --> 00:28:17,269
l wish you well.

348
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:22,203
Vincent, make your peace
with Mr.Joe Zasa.

349
00:28:22,317 --> 00:28:23,716
Come on.

350
00:28:26,655 --> 00:28:28,350
Okay. Go on.

351
00:28:34,195 --> 00:28:36,720
Bastardo.

352
00:28:41,503 --> 00:28:43,994
For Christ's sakes, stop!
What's the matter with you?

353
00:28:44,105 --> 00:28:45,402
Get him out of here.

354
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,532
Oh,Jesus.

355
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:53,375
Uncle Michael, l told Connie
it wasn't the right time for this.

356
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:56,644
- Close it.
- l know you're into banks and stocks.

357
00:28:56,751 --> 00:28:59,413
Everyone knows you're the final word,
like the Supreme Court.

358
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:01,352
l want to protect you from these guys.
Your lawyers can't do that.

359
00:29:01,456 --> 00:29:03,447
- And you can?
- Yeah, l can do that.

360
00:29:05,927 --> 00:29:07,849
Why should l be
afraid of Joe Zasa?

361
00:29:07,963 --> 00:29:11,160
He knows you're stopping him
from rising up in the commission.

362
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:14,360
l say we make him dead.
Give me the order, l'll take care of it.

363
00:29:14,469 --> 00:29:16,699
- You'll take care of it?
- Yeah.

364
00:29:21,042 --> 00:29:23,272
Maybe you should come with me...

365
00:29:23,378 --> 00:29:25,869
for a few weeks,
see what happens.

366
00:29:27,148 --> 00:29:29,070
See if you learn.

367
00:29:30,051 --> 00:29:33,407
Then we'll talk
about your future.

368
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:36,244
l won't let you down.

369
00:29:42,564 --> 00:29:44,452
We're just about ready.

370
00:29:50,772 --> 00:29:53,263
- So what happened?
- What happened?

371
00:29:53,341 --> 00:29:55,969
They put me in a room with Zasa,
what's gonna happen? l bit his ear off.

372
00:29:56,077 --> 00:29:59,501
Here we go.
Watch the card.

373
00:29:59,614 --> 00:30:02,174
- There.
- Hold it.

374
00:30:02,283 --> 00:30:05,081
l'll just change
the plate here.

375
00:30:05,186 --> 00:30:07,211
Vincent.

376
00:30:07,322 --> 00:30:10,018
Take the picture with us.
Come on.

377
00:30:16,865 --> 00:30:19,993
- Nice jacket.
- Little girl--

378
00:30:20,101 --> 00:30:23,059
Closer to the center,
if you would, sir.

379
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:24,900
And here we go.

380
00:30:25,006 --> 00:30:28,066
Ready. Smile.

381
00:30:28,176 --> 00:30:30,736
Excellent.
l'll have it for you on Monday.

382
00:30:45,527 --> 00:30:46,926
Butter cake.
Beautiful.

383
00:30:47,028 --> 00:30:49,690
Godfather, this is the cake
for you and your family...

384
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:52,961
from Enzo the baker.

385
00:30:53,068 --> 00:30:55,093
Want to do it?
All right.

386
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,075
You lead.

387
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:39,677
Kathryn, you lead.

388
00:32:43,812 --> 00:32:46,975
- Vincent?
- What do you want, sweetheart?

389
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,938
Do you love me?

390
00:32:52,187 --> 00:32:54,781
- Come on. Go to bed.
- Come on. Say it.

391
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,686
- Go to bed.
- No. Say it.

392
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:59,123
l love you.
l love you.

393
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,058
l love you too.

394
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,722
You got a cat?

395
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:14,733
Go get us some water,
would you? l'm thirsty.

396
00:33:16,144 --> 00:33:17,702
Come on.

397
00:33:24,953 --> 00:33:26,750
Well, l just guess
l know my place.

398
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:32,180
l can't believe l'm actually
getting up to do this.

399
00:33:32,293 --> 00:33:35,524
''Get me water. Bake me a cake.''
Whatever happened to ''please''?

400
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:24,143
Come on.

401
00:34:24,245 --> 00:34:27,043
Good boy, Sockface.
Let's go for a walk.

402
00:34:35,523 --> 00:34:36,581
Let her go.

403
00:34:36,691 --> 00:34:38,921
Fuck it.
Cut her throat, man.

404
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:43,818
- What'd you say?
- l said, cut her fucking throat.

405
00:34:47,101 --> 00:34:48,432
Let her go.

406
00:34:48,536 --> 00:34:50,492
Drop your gun,
or he'll cut her throat.

407
00:34:50,605 --> 00:34:52,596
l hardly know this broad.

408
00:34:52,707 --> 00:34:54,595
Go ahead and cut her.
What the fuck do l care?

409
00:34:57,045 --> 00:35:00,310
You got no choice, man.
This chick's gonna be dead.

410
00:35:00,415 --> 00:35:03,270
Hurt her,
l'll kill you both.

411
00:35:03,384 --> 00:35:06,774
- Give up that knife, l'll let you go.
- You cut her throat right now.

412
00:35:08,623 --> 00:35:10,352
l'll do something to convince you.
Don't get frightened.

413
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:12,688
Don't do any sudden movements.
Just watch me, all right?

414
00:35:12,794 --> 00:35:14,386
- Hear me?
- Yeah.

415
00:35:17,899 --> 00:35:20,026
Oh, shit!

416
00:35:22,136 --> 00:35:24,525
Drop the knife.
Go ahead. Drop it!

417
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:26,630
Good boy.

418
00:35:26,741 --> 00:35:28,629
Sit down.
l want to talk to you.

419
00:35:28,743 --> 00:35:31,473
lt's a wise choice. Sit down.
l want to talk to you.

420
00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:33,570
Lose the mask.

421
00:35:36,417 --> 00:35:38,112
Relax. Have a smoke.
You smoke?

422
00:35:41,155 --> 00:35:43,043
Whose idea was this?

423
00:35:43,157 --> 00:35:44,954
Who sent you?

424
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,755
Come on. Tell me.
Who sent you?

425
00:35:49,931 --> 00:35:52,593
- No one.
- Take a good look at this guy?

426
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,123
- Yeah.
- So who sent you?

427
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:00,169
lt was Joey.
Joey Zasa.

428
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:16,314
You okay?

429
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,723
- You were going to let them kill me!
- l wasn't gonna let that happen.

430
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:27,426
You pig!
You sick fuck!

431
00:36:27,535 --> 00:36:29,901
Come on, sweetheart, that's gambling.
You wanted gambling? That's gambling.

432
00:36:30,004 --> 00:36:31,892
Call the police.

433
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:40,103
- You killed the other guy too?
- He went for my gun.

434
00:36:40,214 --> 00:36:43,638
lt's self-defense, justifiable homicide.
Go ahead. Call the police.

435
00:36:44,652 --> 00:36:46,745
- Where are you going? Oh, no.
- l'm going to take pictures first.

436
00:36:46,854 --> 00:36:48,913
No pictures.

437
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:51,689
You had a gun.

438
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:53,749
They only had a knife.

439
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:56,955
You could have talked them into
surrendering, handed them to the police.

440
00:36:57,065 --> 00:37:01,058
Zasa sent these guys.
l just sent him a message, that's all.

441
00:37:01,936 --> 00:37:05,428
- Now he has to send you a message back.
- He's gotta send me a message back?

442
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,429
- Zasa's going to send a message?
- He did the right thing.

443
00:37:08,543 --> 00:37:11,774
- He got Zasa's name.
- What does he got to do with it?

444
00:37:11,879 --> 00:37:15,144
Joey Zasa's a pazzo.
Joey Zasa.

445
00:37:17,418 --> 00:37:20,342
All right.
You are what you are.

446
00:37:20,455 --> 00:37:23,811
lt's your nature.
Stay close to me.

447
00:37:23,925 --> 00:37:25,620
You don't do anything.

448
00:37:25,726 --> 00:37:27,717
Keep your mouth shut
and your eyes open.

449
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:31,094
- Do what l tell you. Understand?
- l understand.

450
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:33,588
l got problems
with the commission.

451
00:37:33,701 --> 00:37:36,431
- l know.
- Yes. You don't make them easier.

452
00:37:36,537 --> 00:37:40,200
l understand that.
lt wasn't my idea that this happened.

453
00:37:40,308 --> 00:37:41,832
All right. Go on.
Get out of here.

454
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,939
Now they'll fear you.

455
00:37:48,049 --> 00:37:50,142
Maybe they
should fear you.

456
00:37:53,721 --> 00:37:55,643
BJ, excuse me.
What's up?

457
00:37:55,756 --> 00:37:57,815
The archbishop just called back.

458
00:37:57,925 --> 00:38:00,849
We've arranged
some amazing things for you.

459
00:38:00,962 --> 00:38:02,452
The publicity is phenomenal.

460
00:38:02,563 --> 00:38:04,895
You're the new Rockefeller,
a philanthropist.

461
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:10,830
- Sign right here, please.
- Times do change, don't they?

462
00:38:10,938 --> 00:38:14,271
My father hated foundations.

463
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,833
He loved doing it
by himself, man to man.

464
00:38:17,945 --> 00:38:19,572
But we're different, huh?

465
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,604
lt's no different than
any large corporation.

466
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,083
You control a lot of money
with very little...

467
00:38:25,186 --> 00:38:27,074
minimize taxes...

468
00:38:27,188 --> 00:38:29,577
with no government control.

469
00:38:38,432 --> 00:38:40,127
Godfather?

470
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,225
Andrew.

471
00:38:42,336 --> 00:38:45,191
- Godfather--
- Off to Rome.

472
00:38:45,306 --> 00:38:48,298
l wanted to thank you
for all you've done for me.

473
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:51,742
- Want to have some breakfast with us?
- No, thanks. l can't.

474
00:38:51,846 --> 00:38:53,734
How's your ltalian?

475
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:59,341
- His father was a great lawyer.
- l know.

476
00:38:59,453 --> 00:39:01,842
Didn't live to see him ordained.
l did.

477
00:39:01,956 --> 00:39:04,117
Did you ever see one of those?

478
00:39:04,225 --> 00:39:07,285
Beautiful. l was so proud.
Let me walk you out.

479
00:39:09,063 --> 00:39:11,759
Andrew, if you hear any rumors flying
around the Vatican, let me know.

480
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:14,460
No.
Andrew has the true faith.

481
00:39:24,078 --> 00:39:25,943
Don Corleone...

482
00:39:26,047 --> 00:39:28,072
l need your help.

483
00:39:28,182 --> 00:39:31,640
And not just to light
a little candle.

484
00:39:31,752 --> 00:39:36,246
My gift was to be able
to persuade people...

485
00:39:36,357 --> 00:39:39,622
to give to the Holy Church.

486
00:39:39,727 --> 00:39:41,752
Then Rome decides...

487
00:39:41,862 --> 00:39:44,524
to put me in charge
of the Vatican Bank.

488
00:39:46,601 --> 00:39:49,229
But l was never a true banker.

489
00:39:54,408 --> 00:39:56,740
l trusted my friends.

490
00:39:57,845 --> 00:39:59,801
Friendship and money...

491
00:40:01,115 --> 00:40:02,742
oil and water.

492
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,841
lndeed.

493
00:40:04,952 --> 00:40:08,251
But these friends used...

494
00:40:08,356 --> 00:40:10,244
the good name of the Church...

495
00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:12,952
to feed their greed.

496
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:16,518
lf money was lost...

497
00:40:16,631 --> 00:40:18,553
then l am to blame.

498
00:40:20,234 --> 00:40:22,862
Oh, if only prayer
could pay off...

499
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:25,825
our $ 700 million deficit.

500
00:40:27,475 --> 00:40:30,171
769 million.

501
00:40:35,783 --> 00:40:41,073
The Church owns 25%%
of a large corporation-- lmmobiliare.

502
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:44,150
You know the one l mean.

503
00:40:44,258 --> 00:40:48,524
Largest landlord on earth, real estate
all over the world worth $6 billion.

504
00:40:51,399 --> 00:40:53,060
That's true.

505
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:57,395
And the Vatican vote
is necessary for control.

506
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:03,204
No. No, no.
You're mistaken.

507
00:41:03,311 --> 00:41:05,939
This isn't a question
of one person deciding--

508
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:07,708
one deciding vote.

509
00:41:07,815 --> 00:41:10,010
This is like any other
company in the world.

510
00:41:10,117 --> 00:41:13,609
We have directors. We have rules.
We have very old rules.

511
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:19,045
The pope himself would
have to approve you.

512
00:41:23,698 --> 00:41:25,427
We've sold the casinos...

513
00:41:27,368 --> 00:41:30,257
all businesses having to do
with gambling.

514
00:41:31,372 --> 00:41:34,728
We have no interests
or investments...

515
00:41:34,842 --> 00:41:37,106
in anything illegitimate.

516
00:41:40,114 --> 00:41:44,938
The Corleones are prepared to deposit
$500 million in the Vatican Bank...

517
00:41:45,052 --> 00:41:48,351
at such time as Mr. Corleone receives
majority control of lmmobiliare.

518
00:41:48,456 --> 00:41:51,254
lmmobiliare
could be something new--

519
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,817
a European conglomerate.

520
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:59,195
Few families have control
of such a company.

521
00:42:02,503 --> 00:42:05,336
lt seems in today's world...

522
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,430
the power to absolve debt
is greater...

523
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:09,771
than the power of forgiveness.

524
00:42:12,046 --> 00:42:13,934
$600 million.

525
00:42:18,853 --> 00:42:22,619
Don't overestimate
the power of forgiveness.

526
00:42:24,158 --> 00:42:28,185
Don Corleone,
this deal with lmmobiliare...

527
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:31,151
can make you one of
the richest men in the world.

528
00:42:31,265 --> 00:42:34,462
Your whole past history
and the history of your family...

529
00:42:34,568 --> 00:42:36,798
will be washed away.

530
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,636
600 million.

531
00:42:58,592 --> 00:43:00,514
[Keinszig]
The motion under discussion...

532
00:43:00,628 --> 00:43:03,586
relates to Corleone Group's proposal...

533
00:43:03,698 --> 00:43:06,064
to acquire 1 00 million...

534
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,761
newly issued class ''A '' voting shares.

535
00:43:10,204 --> 00:43:12,126
Once issued, the shares will permit...

536
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:14,628
[B.J. Harrison]
Corleone's capital invested directly...

537
00:43:14,742 --> 00:43:17,870
into International Immobiliare...

538
00:43:17,978 --> 00:43:22,074
an old and respected
European company.

539
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:24,674
But Michael Corleone
has an ambitious program...

540
00:43:24,752 --> 00:43:27,641
to expand this real estate
holding company...

541
00:43:27,755 --> 00:43:31,384
into an international conglomerate
that can meet the challenge...

542
00:43:31,492 --> 00:43:33,619
not by political ideologies...

543
00:43:33,728 --> 00:43:36,253
but by Eastern
techniques of efficiency...

544
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:37,262
and focus...

545
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,424
- Mr. Corleone!
- and unlimited--

546
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,831
Mr. Corleone!
Excuse me.

547
00:43:41,936 --> 00:43:45,793
lsn't it true that you deposited
$200 million in the Vatican Bank...

548
00:43:45,906 --> 00:43:48,932
which is affiliated with
lnternational lmmobiliare?

549
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,841
- This is true. Why not?
- Wasn't there any questioning...

550
00:43:51,946 --> 00:43:55,177
about the timing
on this particular deposit...

551
00:43:55,282 --> 00:43:57,170
or wasn't there
some talk about...

552
00:43:57,284 --> 00:43:59,673
- Mr. Chairman, if l may?
- the fact that--

553
00:44:01,155 --> 00:44:03,487
The Vito Andolino Corleone Foundation...

554
00:44:03,591 --> 00:44:05,684
of which Mr. Corleone's
daughter Mary is chairman...

555
00:44:05,793 --> 00:44:09,183
has established an endowment
in the amount of $ 1 00 million.

556
00:44:09,296 --> 00:44:11,526
The money comes from his own family...

557
00:44:11,632 --> 00:44:13,691
and will be administered
by the Vatican.

558
00:44:13,801 --> 00:44:15,291
Answer your question?

559
00:44:16,504 --> 00:44:19,302
l have always believed...

560
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:23,229
helping your fellow man
is profitable in every sense--

561
00:44:23,344 --> 00:44:25,710
personally and bottom-line.

562
00:44:25,813 --> 00:44:29,977
My fellow shareholders,
if Europe and America...

563
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,881
can learn to cooperate...

564
00:44:31,986 --> 00:44:35,843
if we can learn to pool our wealth,
share our markets...

565
00:44:35,956 --> 00:44:39,221
we can defeat any competition...

566
00:44:39,326 --> 00:44:40,987
anywhere in the world.

567
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,420
Thank you for the time
you've given me today...

568
00:44:44,498 --> 00:44:47,888
and l hope that you
will look favorably on my proposal.

569
00:44:48,002 --> 00:44:49,060
Thank you.

570
00:44:54,708 --> 00:44:57,802
Listen, let me at
this microphone here!

571
00:44:57,912 --> 00:45:01,177
How can we let that criminal
run our company?

572
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:03,409
He's got the map
of Sicily on his face.

573
00:45:03,517 --> 00:45:06,907
- Order! Order!
- He's either Catholic or mafioso.

574
00:45:07,021 --> 00:45:08,079
l say--

575
00:45:10,057 --> 00:45:12,116
The Hamilton lnvestors Group
cannot support...

576
00:45:12,226 --> 00:45:13,784
this proposal.

577
00:45:15,229 --> 00:45:17,720
Your Excellency?

578
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:19,857
Mr. Chairman...

579
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,595
the Vatican Bank feels...

580
00:45:22,703 --> 00:45:27,959
that lnternational lmmobiliare...

581
00:45:28,075 --> 00:45:32,136
will be safe
in Mr. Corleone's hands.

582
00:45:32,246 --> 00:45:35,340
Subject to audit
and final ratification...

583
00:45:35,449 --> 00:45:37,542
which must
take place in Rome...

584
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:40,779
please join me in welcoming
Mr. Michael Corleone.

585
00:45:51,232 --> 00:45:53,291
Dad?

586
00:45:55,603 --> 00:45:58,959
Tony says that l'm a front
for the foundation...

587
00:46:00,641 --> 00:46:04,304
that you're using me just to
pull the strings...

588
00:46:04,411 --> 00:46:07,505
- to get the money where you want it.
- Come on. Please.

589
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:10,038
To shine up
your public image.

590
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,442
Mary, this is real,
this foundation.

591
00:46:14,555 --> 00:46:16,147
lt's real.

592
00:46:18,259 --> 00:46:20,887
l wanted Anthony
to be a part of it.

593
00:46:20,995 --> 00:46:23,520
l thought you two
would be together on this.

594
00:46:23,631 --> 00:46:25,462
l won't interfere.

595
00:46:25,566 --> 00:46:28,057
l'll help only if you ask.

596
00:46:28,135 --> 00:46:30,797
But what is this really for?

597
00:46:30,905 --> 00:46:32,793
Why are you doing this?

598
00:46:32,907 --> 00:46:35,637
Why am l doing this?

599
00:46:35,743 --> 00:46:38,871
l'm doing this for my children.

600
00:46:38,979 --> 00:46:40,935
You're doing it
for your children too.

601
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:44,775
This foundation is supposed
to help all people.

602
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,217
Of course.
That's the purpose.

603
00:46:47,321 --> 00:46:49,949
This is legitimate, Mary.

604
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,945
l swear this is legitimate.

605
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:59,529
Dad, l want this to bring me
closer to you.

606
00:47:07,541 --> 00:47:09,930
l would burn in hell...

607
00:47:10,044 --> 00:47:11,932
to keep you safe.

608
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,283
No, no. You go in the other car.
l'll ride with Michael.

609
00:47:28,395 --> 00:47:29,987
Go, go, go.

610
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:46,743
As your family's oldest friend...

611
00:47:46,847 --> 00:47:50,180
l'm always chosen
to bring you messages.

612
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,009
Tell me, Don Altobello.

613
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:01,451
Your old partners are grateful
for the money you made them.

614
00:48:01,562 --> 00:48:04,827
They worship you.

615
00:48:04,932 --> 00:48:07,765
But their hearts are broken...

616
00:48:07,868 --> 00:48:11,326
because they think
you abandoned them.

617
00:48:11,438 --> 00:48:15,067
They want to share your deal
on lmmobiliare...

618
00:48:16,076 --> 00:48:17,964
to be a family again.

619
00:48:18,078 --> 00:48:20,603
lt can purify their money.

620
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,382
This l cannot do.

621
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:30,548
lmmobiliare must be legitimate.

622
00:48:32,393 --> 00:48:35,157
l know.

623
00:48:35,262 --> 00:48:37,025
But they're unhappy.

624
00:48:39,533 --> 00:48:41,296
And you?

625
00:48:41,402 --> 00:48:45,259
l ask nothing for myself.

626
00:48:45,372 --> 00:48:47,533
Only peace in my old age.

627
00:48:47,641 --> 00:48:50,769
But l must please
the world around me.

628
00:48:52,913 --> 00:48:57,407
Michael, your father was
a reasonable man.

629
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:59,406
Learn from him.

630
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:05,079
l learned many things
from my father.

631
00:49:10,164 --> 00:49:12,462
Call a meeting, my friend...

632
00:49:12,566 --> 00:49:16,627
so there are no debts or grudges.

633
00:49:16,737 --> 00:49:18,500
We will make the peace...

634
00:49:18,605 --> 00:49:20,163
you and l.

635
00:49:59,513 --> 00:50:01,572
They just had
a press conference.

636
00:50:01,682 --> 00:50:03,843
They said the pope's
condition is grave--

637
00:50:03,951 --> 00:50:06,579
gravissimo,
they said.

638
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:44,682
Please...

639
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:46,521
our group represents...

640
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:49,425
a consortium
of Catholic businessmen...

641
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:52,624
against the Corleone control.

642
00:50:52,733 --> 00:50:55,622
The Vatican has cast its vote.

643
00:50:55,736 --> 00:50:58,125
The Corleone Group
already controls the board.

644
00:50:58,238 --> 00:51:02,129
According to the Lateran Treaty,
the Vatican's vote must be ratified...

645
00:51:02,242 --> 00:51:05,973
here in Rome by the pope.

646
00:51:09,516 --> 00:51:12,815
The pope is gravely ill.

647
00:51:14,054 --> 00:51:16,545
Until he recovers...

648
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:18,784
l am powerless.

649
00:51:18,892 --> 00:51:21,122
What if he dies?

650
00:51:21,228 --> 00:51:22,820
Then...

651
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:25,990
as you Americans say,
all bets are off.

652
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:28,863
Gentlemen, please.

653
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:31,998
This is a brief delay...

654
00:51:32,105 --> 00:51:33,595
nothing more.

655
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:41,603
Your Excellency, gentlemen...

656
00:51:41,715 --> 00:51:45,014
l advise you join us
in our prayers...

657
00:51:45,118 --> 00:51:48,451
for the Holy Father's recovery.

658
00:51:48,555 --> 00:51:50,250
We had an agreement!

659
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:55,416
This meeting was to be merely
a formality. That's all it was.

660
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:58,953
-Please sit down.
-l'd rather stand. Could someone answer?

661
00:51:59,066 --> 00:52:02,854
- We have put ourselves on the line--
- The lmmobiliare has its roots...

662
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:04,801
in the European tradition.

663
00:52:04,905 --> 00:52:06,395
Please try to understand.

664
00:52:06,473 --> 00:52:08,361
l understand.

665
00:52:08,475 --> 00:52:10,534
Your tactics are despicable.

666
00:52:10,644 --> 00:52:14,410
Well, that's quite an indictment,
coming from a Corleone.

667
00:52:14,514 --> 00:52:15,947
Gentlemen!

668
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:19,177
Remember you're in the Vatican.
Please.

669
00:52:22,089 --> 00:52:24,478
What is it that you want?

670
00:52:24,591 --> 00:52:25,853
Yes.

671
00:52:25,959 --> 00:52:28,587
You will take control.

672
00:52:28,695 --> 00:52:32,654
We'll gladly put you at the helm
of our little fleet...

673
00:52:32,766 --> 00:52:36,998
but our ships must all sail
in the same direction.

674
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,671
Otherwise...

675
00:52:39,773 --> 00:52:43,971
who can say how long
your stay with us will last?

676
00:52:46,113 --> 00:52:48,172
lt's not personal.

677
00:52:48,282 --> 00:52:50,204
lt's only business.

678
00:52:50,317 --> 00:52:52,547
You should know, Godfather.

679
00:52:55,989 --> 00:52:57,547
Very well.

680
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:01,554
You want to do
business with me...

681
00:53:01,662 --> 00:53:03,755
l will do business with you.

682
00:53:04,898 --> 00:53:06,786
Vipers, all of them.

683
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,864
- We're back with the Borgias.
- Uncle Michael.

684
00:53:15,976 --> 00:53:17,603
Andrew.

685
00:53:17,711 --> 00:53:20,771
l heard you were here.
lt's so nice to see you.

686
00:53:20,881 --> 00:53:23,645
- Vincent.
- How are you?

687
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:27,242
What is this with the Borgias?
Those days are over, Michael.

688
00:53:32,526 --> 00:53:35,916
- Recognize it?
- Yeah.

689
00:53:36,029 --> 00:53:38,156
Genco Olive Oil.

690
00:53:38,265 --> 00:53:40,460
That's where our grandfather
got his start...

691
00:53:40,567 --> 00:53:42,933
as a delivery boy making
three bucks a week.

692
00:53:43,036 --> 00:53:44,924
Three years later,
he owned the company.

693
00:53:45,038 --> 00:53:48,132
- Only in America.
- That's it.

694
00:53:48,241 --> 00:53:50,334
Vincenzo, where have you been hiding?

695
00:53:50,444 --> 00:53:53,140
You deserted us
when we need your help.

696
00:53:53,246 --> 00:53:54,508
What can l do?

697
00:53:54,614 --> 00:53:57,674
Get rid of Joe Zasa.
He sells drugs to children.

698
00:53:57,784 --> 00:54:00,344
When l was a girl, it was different.
l'm an older woman...

699
00:54:00,454 --> 00:54:02,217
afraid to walk the streets
at night.

700
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:04,688
Where are they supposed to be at?

701
00:54:04,791 --> 00:54:07,123
- Lou, what's going on?
- He's going pazzo.

702
00:54:07,227 --> 00:54:09,252
- We're late.
- Don't tell me that garbage.

703
00:54:09,363 --> 00:54:12,423
- Have l ever let you down?
- l trust you.

704
00:54:12,532 --> 00:54:14,955
- Don't worry about it.
- Thank you very much.

705
00:54:15,068 --> 00:54:16,899
Enjoy yourself.

706
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:24,743
What was that?

707
00:54:26,046 --> 00:54:28,071
Neighborhood's in trouble.

708
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:31,241
- You're keeping your eye out for them?
- That's right.

709
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:34,149
- And for me?
- From now on.

710
00:54:34,254 --> 00:54:36,484
l missed you all this time.

711
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:38,979
l missed you, too, cousin.

712
00:54:39,092 --> 00:54:41,981
l missed growing up
with all my cousins.

713
00:54:42,095 --> 00:54:44,518
l didn't know you,
and l missed you.

714
00:54:44,631 --> 00:54:49,489
Do you remember stories
about our fathers, the old days?

715
00:54:49,603 --> 00:54:51,992
Yeah. What do you
want to know?

716
00:54:54,474 --> 00:54:56,032
What was Sonny like?

717
00:54:58,645 --> 00:55:01,239
He was the prince of the city.

718
00:55:01,348 --> 00:55:05,170
He died before l was born, but l heard
a million stories. He was a legend.

719
00:55:06,953 --> 00:55:09,046
What about my father?

720
00:55:09,156 --> 00:55:11,647
A great man, your father.

721
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:14,649
He's a hero.
He saved the family.

722
00:55:15,996 --> 00:55:17,884
- Vincent.
- What?

723
00:55:17,998 --> 00:55:20,728
Did he kill
his own brother?

724
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:31,237
So those are all lies?

725
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,469
Just stories, sweetheart.

726
00:55:44,724 --> 00:55:45,918
l believe you.

727
00:55:47,828 --> 00:55:51,753
- l'm glad you're around.
- l'm glad you're here too.

728
00:56:14,488 --> 00:56:17,821
l'd like to take Joey Zasa up
for a ride in this and drop him.

729
00:56:17,924 --> 00:56:20,813
Joey Zasa is nothing.

730
00:56:20,927 --> 00:56:23,418
He's a small-time enforcer.

731
00:56:23,497 --> 00:56:26,295
He bluffs, threats, but nothing.

732
00:56:26,399 --> 00:56:28,924
You'll be able to see him coming
a mile away.

733
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:32,031
We should kill him
before he kills--

734
00:56:35,275 --> 00:56:38,164
Never hate your enemies.

735
00:56:38,278 --> 00:56:40,303
lt affects your judgment.

736
00:56:55,228 --> 00:56:58,720
Good evening.
Nice to see you again, Mr. Corleone.

737
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:21,943
Okay, girls, let's go.
Come on, girls.

738
00:57:39,172 --> 00:57:43,529
We trusted you to manage
our money in the casinos.

739
00:57:43,643 --> 00:57:45,838
lt's not even 20 years...

740
00:57:45,946 --> 00:57:49,541
you sold the casinos
and you made fortunes for all of us.

741
00:57:49,649 --> 00:57:51,537
Bravo, Don Corleone!

742
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:55,146
Thank you.

743
00:57:56,356 --> 00:57:59,689
Friends, l have come here...

744
00:57:59,793 --> 00:58:03,456
because our business
together is done.

745
00:58:04,864 --> 00:58:08,595
We have prospered,
and now it is time for us...

746
00:58:08,702 --> 00:58:11,899
to dissolve the business
relationship between us.

747
00:58:13,707 --> 00:58:15,902
That's it.

748
00:58:16,009 --> 00:58:18,773
But l do have
a little surprise. Al?

749
00:58:21,781 --> 00:58:24,579
Your shares in the casino.

750
00:58:24,684 --> 00:58:26,572
l thought l'd cut through
all the red tape...

751
00:58:26,686 --> 00:58:29,018
so you can get
your money right away.

752
00:58:35,128 --> 00:58:39,417
- $50 million!
- Not everybody gets the same.

753
00:58:39,532 --> 00:58:41,454
- lt depends on how much...
- Nothing for you.

754
00:58:41,568 --> 00:58:43,456
you invested and how long for.

755
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:46,528
Michael,
this is really generous!

756
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,699
Oh, wonderful.

757
00:58:51,811 --> 00:58:55,668
- Hey, Parisi, how much did you invest?
- l don't remember.

758
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,909
Michael, you're blessed.

759
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:07,289
My family has done
much of the hard work...

760
00:59:07,394 --> 00:59:09,282
taken many risks...

761
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:13,990
all to make money
for the rest of the families.

762
00:59:16,403 --> 00:59:19,236
You all know Joey Zasa.

763
00:59:19,339 --> 00:59:21,728
He is, l admit, an important man.

764
00:59:22,876 --> 00:59:27,074
His picture is on the cover
of the New York Times Magazine.

765
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,774
He gets the Esquire magazine award...

766
00:59:29,883 --> 00:59:32,408
for the best-dressed gangster.

767
00:59:32,519 --> 00:59:34,407
The newspapers praise him...

768
00:59:34,521 --> 00:59:37,319
because he hires blacks
into his family...

769
00:59:37,424 --> 00:59:39,085
which shows he has a good heart.

770
00:59:41,361 --> 00:59:43,886
He is famous.

771
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:47,785
Who knows?
Maybe one day...

772
00:59:47,901 --> 00:59:50,165
he will make all of you popular.

773
00:59:51,771 --> 00:59:53,170
lt's true.

774
00:59:53,273 --> 00:59:58,597
l make more of a bella figura.
That is my nature.

775
00:59:58,712 --> 01:00:03,945
But l also want to make a move
into legitimate enterprises.

776
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:06,814
l'd like to get a little pin
from the pope.

777
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:12,347
Sure, l take the blacks and the Spanish
into my family...

778
01:00:12,459 --> 01:00:15,849
because that's America.

779
01:00:15,962 --> 01:00:20,717
And you guarantee that they don't
deal drugs in those neighborhoods.

780
01:00:21,835 --> 01:00:27,034
l don't guarantee that.
l guarantee l'll kill anybody who does.

781
01:00:31,144 --> 01:00:33,908
Let me talk to him.

782
01:00:34,013 --> 01:00:36,243
Who can refuse Don Altobello?

783
01:00:39,586 --> 01:00:43,875
l say to all of you,
l have been treated this day...

784
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:46,379
with no respect.

785
01:00:46,493 --> 01:00:50,156
l've earned you all money.
l've made you rich...

786
01:00:50,263 --> 01:00:51,821
and l asked for little.

787
01:00:51,931 --> 01:00:55,822
Good. You will not give?
l'll take.

788
01:00:57,103 --> 01:00:59,663
As for Don Corleone...

789
01:00:59,773 --> 01:01:03,436
well, he makes it
very clear to me today...

790
01:01:03,543 --> 01:01:06,740
that he is my enemy.

791
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:12,138
You must choose between us.

792
01:01:20,727 --> 01:01:22,786
We can reason together.

793
01:01:26,866 --> 01:01:29,960
Please, let's agree, huh?

794
01:01:30,069 --> 01:01:31,957
He doesn't know what he's--

795
01:01:40,547 --> 01:01:42,435
The news is everywhere.

796
01:01:42,549 --> 01:01:46,440
Everyone is saying
that you control lmmobiliare.

797
01:01:46,553 --> 01:01:50,614
lmmobiliare already is laundering money
in Peru and Nassau.

798
01:01:50,723 --> 01:01:51,951
We know that.

799
01:01:52,058 --> 01:01:55,755
Listen to me. We've been
friends for 40 years.

800
01:01:55,862 --> 01:01:57,625
We should wet
our beaks a little, huh?

801
01:01:57,730 --> 01:02:00,995
- We want to do business with you.
- That's right.

802
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:03,056
- We've been together too much.
- We can wash our money clean...

803
01:02:03,169 --> 01:02:04,932
in the holy water of--

804
01:02:10,276 --> 01:02:12,107
What the hell is that?

805
01:02:12,212 --> 01:02:13,975
- lt's a hit. Let's go. Follow me.
- Let's get outta here!

806
01:02:34,767 --> 01:02:37,656
- My coat! lt's my lucky coat!
- Forget your coat.

807
01:02:38,771 --> 01:02:40,602
lt's my lucky coat!

808
01:02:46,779 --> 01:02:48,178
Stay right behind me!

809
01:03:03,763 --> 01:03:06,186
- Fuck!
- Mikey, this way!

810
01:03:15,975 --> 01:03:18,341
You son of a bitch.

811
01:03:38,097 --> 01:03:40,156
Come on, we're outta here.

812
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:14,598
You did good.

813
01:04:16,035 --> 01:04:19,129
The old Dons were pretty much
wiped out.

814
01:04:19,238 --> 01:04:22,127
The ones that survived
made deals with Joey Zasa.

815
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:28,770
He survived. He's with his daughters
now in Staten lsland.

816
01:04:28,881 --> 01:04:31,270
Says he's gonna retire to Sicily.

817
01:04:33,052 --> 01:04:38,012
Joey Zasa would never pull something
like this without the backing.

818
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:41,514
He's just muscle.
He's an enforcer. He's nothing.

819
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:44,017
He doesn't have the wit
for that helicopter attack.

820
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,724
He doesn't even have the ambition
to wipe out the whole commission.

821
01:04:46,833 --> 01:04:51,293
- Certainly not the balls.
- l say we hit back and take Zasa out!

822
01:04:57,043 --> 01:04:59,932
Never let anyone know
what you're thinking.

823
01:05:08,054 --> 01:05:10,943
Well, let's get a message
to Joey Zasa.

824
01:05:14,027 --> 01:05:16,086
l respect what he's done.

825
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:20,758
The new overthrows the old.
lt's natural.

826
01:05:20,867 --> 01:05:22,266
How can you do business
with this guy?

827
01:05:25,972 --> 01:05:30,033
l'm a businessman, first and foremost.
l want no further conflict with him.

828
01:05:30,143 --> 01:05:32,805
You tell him from me
that he can live or he can die.

829
01:05:32,912 --> 01:05:34,971
Vincent, will you shut up!

830
01:05:53,132 --> 01:05:55,054
That's it.

831
01:05:58,838 --> 01:06:01,227
He can't be doing this alone.

832
01:06:04,977 --> 01:06:09,971
Just when l thought l was out,
they pull me back in.

833
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:20,420
Our true enemy...

834
01:06:20,526 --> 01:06:23,415
has not yet shown his face.

835
01:06:36,142 --> 01:06:38,531
- Has he had his medicine?
- l don't know what he took.

836
01:06:42,648 --> 01:06:45,139
- l got my wind back.
- Call a doctor.

837
01:06:47,653 --> 01:06:49,746
Run, run!

838
01:06:49,856 --> 01:06:52,916
Run at thunderbolt.
Thunder can't hurt.

839
01:06:53,025 --> 01:06:55,755
Harmless noise.

840
01:06:55,862 --> 01:06:57,955
- Get an ambulance.
- Bullshit!

841
01:06:58,064 --> 01:07:01,852
You deceitful old fuck.

842
01:07:01,968 --> 01:07:04,459
Altobello, you fuck!

843
01:07:22,722 --> 01:07:24,610
Vitals are all steady.

844
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:30,861
Lift.

845
01:07:34,867 --> 01:07:35,925
Oh, God.

846
01:07:36,035 --> 01:07:37,923
- Okay, okay.
- Dad.

847
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:41,995
Excuse me. Clear, please.

848
01:07:42,108 --> 01:07:43,996
l'll call Kay.

849
01:07:54,387 --> 01:07:56,947
- Good evening, sir.
- Can we wait here? l'll be right back.

850
01:07:57,056 --> 01:07:58,455
Certainly, sir.

851
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:08,854
Mr. Harrison,
you said it was urgent.

852
01:08:08,968 --> 01:08:11,493
Have you come to confess your sins?

853
01:08:11,604 --> 01:08:13,663
Michael Corleone suffered
a diabetic stroke.

854
01:08:13,773 --> 01:08:16,867
l thought you should know that
before you read it in the papers.

855
01:08:16,976 --> 01:08:19,137
He's in a coma
on the critical list.

856
01:08:19,245 --> 01:08:21,770
l'm here to insist
the deal goes through in any event.

857
01:08:21,881 --> 01:08:23,974
The pope has not much time left.

858
01:08:25,651 --> 01:08:29,678
So, as you,
l am in a difficult position.

859
01:08:29,789 --> 01:08:32,178
We have to ratify this deal
as soon as possible.

860
01:08:33,893 --> 01:08:35,781
We have an understanding.

861
01:08:35,895 --> 01:08:39,228
Good. l'm going to the hospital.

862
01:08:39,332 --> 01:08:42,221
- l'll pray for Mr. Corleone.
- Thank you.

863
01:08:46,572 --> 01:08:48,130
Our thoughts are with Mr. Corleone.

864
01:08:48,241 --> 01:08:50,129
Thank you, Father.

865
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:58,002
Everything will be out in the open
if Corleone dies.

866
01:08:58,117 --> 01:09:00,210
Pray for time, Keinszig.

867
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:05,712
A habit born of...
a long contemplation of eternity.

868
01:09:12,331 --> 01:09:16,062
-Just forget about it, Vinnie.
-Why forget about it? lt's a simple hit.

869
01:09:16,168 --> 01:09:20,628
Look, l'd love to smack Joey Zasa
then whack the fag, okay?

870
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:24,232
But it's impossible.
He's always mingling with people...

871
01:09:24,343 --> 01:09:27,335
in front of TV cameras
in his own neighborhood.

872
01:09:27,446 --> 01:09:30,074
- lt's impossible.
- lt's not. lt'll work for us.

873
01:09:30,182 --> 01:09:31,740
How?

874
01:09:31,851 --> 01:09:36,879
You think he's gonna let Uncle Michael
survive this thing? Would you?

875
01:09:36,989 --> 01:09:41,187
He may not survive anyway.
How would you do it?

876
01:09:41,294 --> 01:09:43,683
l'd do it.
l'd do it myself.

877
01:09:45,798 --> 01:09:47,686
Do it!

878
01:09:49,735 --> 01:09:52,465
- What would you need?
- See if you can get me a couple guys.

879
01:10:28,174 --> 01:10:30,062
lt's Kay.

880
01:10:38,684 --> 01:10:40,777
l never expected you to come.

881
01:10:40,886 --> 01:10:43,275
No, l know, l know.

882
01:10:45,891 --> 01:10:47,620
But l'm here.

883
01:10:51,397 --> 01:10:53,456
- l'm glad.
- You know...

884
01:10:57,136 --> 01:10:59,502
this is the first time
l've seen you look so helpless.

885
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:06,699
lt's not so bad, really.

886
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:12,478
l feel...
l'm getting wiser now.

887
01:11:12,585 --> 01:11:15,884
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

888
01:11:15,988 --> 01:11:17,876
The sicker you get,
the wiser you get, huh?

889
01:11:19,392 --> 01:11:21,622
When l'm dead,
l'm gonna be really smart.

890
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:27,522
- Yeah?
- l want to thank you for Tony.

891
01:11:30,403 --> 01:11:34,692
He's doing really well.
He's gotten some very good notices...

892
01:11:34,807 --> 01:11:37,901
and he's going to be making
his operatic debut in Sicily...

893
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:40,501
in Palermo, this Easter.

894
01:11:42,314 --> 01:11:43,713
So, thank you.

895
01:11:45,317 --> 01:11:48,206
That's a real honor.
ln Sicily.

896
01:11:53,325 --> 01:11:57,284
l will be there.
l won't miss that.

897
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:58,886
l won't miss that.

898
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:10,963
Go see Dad.

899
01:12:16,148 --> 01:12:18,173
- Oh, sweetheart.
- Everything's gonna be all right.

900
01:12:21,353 --> 01:12:23,844
- How you doing, Papa?
- Come here.

901
01:12:25,825 --> 01:12:28,885
Your mother told me.
She told me what happened.

902
01:12:28,994 --> 01:12:32,589
About Palermo?
l really want you to be there, Dad.

903
01:12:32,698 --> 01:12:35,087
Of course. Come here, kiss me.

904
01:12:54,353 --> 01:12:56,412
- Cousin Vinnie?
- No, he isn't here.

905
01:12:56,522 --> 01:13:00,413
Why don't you call his apartment,
leave a message on his machine?

906
01:13:00,526 --> 01:13:02,892
- lt's your cousin, Mary.
- Let her in.

907
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:09,359
- Thanks. Hi, cous.
- Hi.

908
01:13:09,468 --> 01:13:12,028
l just thought l'd drop by.
ls that okay?

909
01:13:12,138 --> 01:13:14,026
l'm gonna get the guys.

910
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:19,031
No, it's not okay.
You shouldn't have come.

911
01:13:20,679 --> 01:13:22,909
A couple minutes only, okay?

912
01:13:24,316 --> 01:13:27,205
- You look beautiful, cous.
- Thanks.

913
01:13:30,389 --> 01:13:33,688
So this is your club,
your hideout?

914
01:13:33,792 --> 01:13:36,955
- Yeah.
- l came here to check it out.

915
01:13:41,567 --> 01:13:45,560
lt's so strange, just me
and Aunt Connie in the house.

916
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:48,663
l feel better when l'm with you.

917
01:13:48,774 --> 01:13:50,469
What's wrong, sweetheart?

918
01:13:50,576 --> 01:13:53,306
- l'm really scared about my father.
- Don't be scared.

919
01:13:53,412 --> 01:13:57,234
When l saw them take him out of
that ambulance, l thought he was dead.

920
01:13:57,349 --> 01:14:00,238
l know.
Everybody says he's gonna be better.

921
01:14:02,121 --> 01:14:04,385
Don't worry, okay?

922
01:14:04,490 --> 01:14:07,050
l remember them shooting at our house
when l was little.

923
01:14:08,227 --> 01:14:10,991
And Al Neri came one time
with other bodyguards...

924
01:14:11,096 --> 01:14:13,155
and just took me and Tony away.

925
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:17,159
ls it all happening again?

926
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:20,592
Not like that, sweetie.

927
01:14:22,374 --> 01:14:27,971
Then why are you hiding here?
ls something going to happen to you?

928
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:31,971
Nothing's gonna happen to me.
l'll take care of you.

929
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:47,791
- Can l stay here and hide out with you?
- You have to make gnocchi for the boys.

930
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:51,290
You know l don't know how to cook,
but l'll help.

931
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,615
Okay.

932
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:08,607
What do l do?

933
01:15:40,686 --> 01:15:43,575
- l love you, cous.
- l love you, too, cous.

934
01:15:47,726 --> 01:15:49,614
Okay, let's cook.

935
01:16:06,045 --> 01:16:07,444
Hold me.

936
01:16:43,916 --> 01:16:46,043
You know, the people like you,
the press, the police...

937
01:16:46,151 --> 01:16:48,813
you use words like ''Mafia,''
''Cosa Nostra.''

938
01:16:48,921 --> 01:16:52,778
This is a fantasy.
The ltalian-Americans are great people.

939
01:16:52,891 --> 01:16:55,223
We laid the bricks that built
this city. We have the artists.

940
01:16:55,327 --> 01:16:57,283
We have Meucci.
He invented the telephone.

941
01:16:57,396 --> 01:17:01,127
We have Don Ameche who played the guy
who invented the telephone. Huh?

942
01:17:01,233 --> 01:17:03,292
So, listen, buy yourself
a nice raffle ticket.

943
01:17:03,402 --> 01:17:05,290
Maybe win yourself a Cadillac.

944
01:17:06,805 --> 01:17:09,103
The salciccia is wonderful.

945
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,403
Here, have a sandwich.
Let's go.

946
01:17:24,189 --> 01:17:26,111
Nice to see you, Mr. Zasa.

947
01:17:26,225 --> 01:17:28,113
Have a nice time.

948
01:17:29,361 --> 01:17:31,750
Don't forget to buy
your raffle tickets, huh?

949
01:17:34,666 --> 01:17:36,793
What are you doin'?

950
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:39,393
- He's sorry. Come here, son.
- Okay, let's go.

951
01:18:01,326 --> 01:18:02,452
What's what?
How are you?

952
01:18:03,562 --> 01:18:06,087
How are you, buddy boy, huh?

953
01:18:08,967 --> 01:18:10,025
Up your ass!

954
01:18:11,703 --> 01:18:14,092
- Who is that, huh? You know him?
- lgnore him.

955
01:18:14,206 --> 01:18:18,028
Hey,Joey, who's gonna win the car?
The Ant?

956
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:22,368
This is the thing that gives
the ltalian-Americans a bad name, huh?

957
01:18:22,481 --> 01:18:24,039
A cappone like this, huh?

958
01:18:24,149 --> 01:18:26,538
Hey,Joey, up your ass!

959
01:18:26,652 --> 01:18:29,610
Get off of that fuckin' car.
You got a raffle ticket?

960
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:34,145
Take a good look
at my raffle ticket here.

961
01:18:34,259 --> 01:18:38,252
Here's what l think of you
and your raffle ticket.

962
01:18:38,363 --> 01:18:40,251
l told you,
get the fuck outta here, punk.

963
01:18:40,365 --> 01:18:42,094
l'll break your fuckin' arm.

964
01:18:42,201 --> 01:18:44,624
l want you to get the fuck outta here.

965
01:18:44,736 --> 01:18:47,398
Get outta here.
Get outta here.

966
01:19:02,888 --> 01:19:04,412
Run,Joey, you piece of shit!

967
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:20,703
- Open the door! Open the door!
- Hi,Joe.

968
01:19:43,695 --> 01:19:49,190
Don't ever again give
that kind of order.

969
01:19:49,301 --> 01:19:50,996
Not while l'm alive.

970
01:19:51,103 --> 01:19:52,991
Understand?

971
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:58,067
You were too sick to make a decision.
l got a go-ahead from Neri.

972
01:19:59,177 --> 01:20:00,667
l got a go-ahead from Connie.

973
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:15,857
lt was the right decision,
Uncle Michael.

974
01:20:15,961 --> 01:20:19,818
lt was the wrong decision.
l command this family.

975
01:20:19,932 --> 01:20:23,231
Right or wrong...

976
01:20:23,335 --> 01:20:25,724
it was not what l wanted!

977
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:46,512
Do you understand?

978
01:20:52,631 --> 01:20:54,462
Yes.

979
01:21:01,373 --> 01:21:02,931
Come on, Michael.

980
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:16,119
Yes!

981
01:21:18,056 --> 01:21:20,047
Good.

982
01:21:20,158 --> 01:21:25,152
Help me to my bed. l wanna
talk to you alone for a minute.

983
01:21:32,371 --> 01:21:36,796
You know, l always felt
responsible for you.

984
01:21:36,908 --> 01:21:38,466
You know that.

985
01:21:39,878 --> 01:21:43,302
Your father-- my brother--

986
01:21:43,415 --> 01:21:46,111
we were opposites.

987
01:21:46,218 --> 01:21:48,982
We would fight and argue...

988
01:21:49,087 --> 01:21:51,078
but l never doubted his love.

989
01:21:51,189 --> 01:21:54,579
He would do anything for me.

990
01:21:54,693 --> 01:21:56,456
But his temper...

991
01:21:59,598 --> 01:22:01,964
it was too much.

992
01:22:02,067 --> 01:22:03,625
Clouded his reason.

993
01:22:04,903 --> 01:22:07,792
l don't want you to make
that mistake.

994
01:22:10,442 --> 01:22:11,841
Also...

995
01:22:12,778 --> 01:22:16,009
he, too, had a way with women.

996
01:22:18,583 --> 01:22:22,371
- So l hear.
- What are you doing with my daughter?

997
01:22:25,057 --> 01:22:26,945
What are you doing with her?

998
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:33,718
lt's too dangerous.

999
01:22:36,468 --> 01:22:38,356
You hear me?

1000
01:23:05,797 --> 01:23:07,992
When they come...

1001
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:10,489
they'll come at what you love.

1002
01:23:18,343 --> 01:23:21,676
Michael, you must lead
another life.

1003
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:23,941
You have everything a man could desire.

1004
01:23:24,049 --> 01:23:27,712
lt's time for you to retire.

1005
01:23:27,819 --> 01:23:30,208
l have too much responsibility.

1006
01:23:34,192 --> 01:23:37,582
Too difficult now.
You should really get out.

1007
01:23:37,696 --> 01:23:42,429
What do you know
about those pezzonovante in ltaly?

1008
01:23:46,338 --> 01:23:50,126
l'm too old to know anything
about those new people.

1009
01:23:50,242 --> 01:23:54,872
l must accept my age
and grow my olives and tomatoes.

1010
01:23:56,148 --> 01:24:00,903
- We're not that old.
- But you're very ill.

1011
01:24:03,688 --> 01:24:06,020
Let me see what can be done.

1012
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:10,549
Let me work to make your path
a little easier.

1013
01:24:10,662 --> 01:24:13,927
Your friendship does that always.

1014
01:24:14,032 --> 01:24:15,920
That makes me happy.

1015
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:20,303
You were wrong about him.

1016
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:25,030
l trust too much.
That's always been my fault.

1017
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:36,811
Treachery is everywhere.

1018
01:24:36,922 --> 01:24:42,610
You still have your fingers
on the strings, even now.

1019
01:24:42,727 --> 01:24:45,116
Let's see more of each other.

1020
01:24:47,499 --> 01:24:49,888
- In Sicily?
- In Sicily.

1021
01:25:43,192 --> 01:25:45,524
How are you?

1022
01:25:45,628 --> 01:25:48,153
Don Bendino, my old friend.

1023
01:26:19,495 --> 01:26:21,554
l wanted to bring you here...

1024
01:26:21,664 --> 01:26:25,293
so that my old friend and protector,
Don Tommasino...

1025
01:26:25,401 --> 01:26:27,289
could advise us.

1026
01:26:45,621 --> 01:26:49,580
The bloodbath in Atlantic City
left New York a mess.

1027
01:26:49,692 --> 01:26:53,150
Now,Joey Zasa at least was running
a fairly tight ship.

1028
01:26:53,262 --> 01:26:56,754
But now that he's out of the picture,
we're obligated to step in.

1029
01:26:56,866 --> 01:26:58,925
Step back in?

1030
01:26:59,035 --> 01:27:01,424
lf we don't,
the Chinese and Colombians will.

1031
01:27:32,735 --> 01:27:36,466
Our ships must all sail
in the same direction.

1032
01:27:37,773 --> 01:27:40,833
ltalian politics have had
these kind of men for centuries.

1033
01:27:40,943 --> 01:27:43,434
They are the true Mafia.

1034
01:27:43,546 --> 01:27:46,902
The archbishop and the Vatican Bank,
that's the big problem.

1035
01:27:47,016 --> 01:27:51,339
They're the same problem.
BJ, they're connected.

1036
01:27:51,454 --> 01:27:54,480
The archbishop has
very powerful friends.

1037
01:27:57,493 --> 01:27:59,324
They totally protect him.

1038
01:28:24,954 --> 01:28:27,548
l will go see
this Cardinal Lamberto...

1039
01:28:27,657 --> 01:28:30,512
and see if we can work things out
in a civilized way.

1040
01:28:32,428 --> 01:28:34,487
You honor your agreements...

1041
01:28:34,597 --> 01:28:37,122
but these people
you're dealing with are crooks.

1042
01:28:37,233 --> 01:28:39,121
They have no honor.

1043
01:28:42,238 --> 01:28:43,728
My word is final.

1044
01:29:21,110 --> 01:29:23,203
l've invited you all here...

1045
01:29:23,312 --> 01:29:27,544
to celebrate my son's
first appearance in an opera house.

1046
01:29:27,650 --> 01:29:29,208
- We're playing Philadelphia.
- He'll be appearing...

1047
01:29:29,318 --> 01:29:31,274
- What's Philadelphia?
- in about three weeks...

1048
01:29:31,387 --> 01:29:33,446
Seven cards, two down,
four up, one down...

1049
01:29:33,556 --> 01:29:35,512
- at the Theatre Massimo...
- deuces and one-eyed jacks are wild.

1050
01:29:35,625 --> 01:29:38,253
in the opera ''Cavallaria''Rusticana.

1051
01:29:38,361 --> 01:29:42,183
lt's Cavalleria Rusticana.

1052
01:29:42,298 --> 01:29:45,222
l think l got tickets
to the wrong opera.

1053
01:29:45,334 --> 01:29:48,497
l've been in New York too long.
Anyway...

1054
01:29:48,604 --> 01:29:52,165
you will all receive tickets,
so come on time.

1055
01:29:52,275 --> 01:29:54,163
Dad, l've got a present for you.

1056
01:29:58,347 --> 01:30:00,474
lt comes from the town of Corleone...

1057
01:30:00,583 --> 01:30:02,608
and it's authentic Sicilian.

1058
01:30:03,719 --> 01:30:07,280
And l learned it for you.

1059
01:31:36,545 --> 01:31:40,641
She was wonderful, beautiful,
and I loved her.

1060
01:31:40,750 --> 01:31:42,980
Then she died.

1061
01:31:43,085 --> 01:31:46,680
My trusted bodyguard...

1062
01:31:46,789 --> 01:31:50,020
planted a bomb in my car.

1063
01:31:50,126 --> 01:31:52,014
She drove it before l did.

1064
01:31:53,629 --> 01:31:57,292
Why is such a beautiful country
so violent?

1065
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:58,958
History.

1066
01:31:59,068 --> 01:32:01,332
Mom was telling me about the old days.

1067
01:32:01,437 --> 01:32:05,567
- Your biggest worry was passing exams.
- Yes, it was then.

1068
01:32:05,674 --> 01:32:07,665
l worry about you now.

1069
01:32:09,345 --> 01:32:12,906
Mary, you're such a warmhearted girl.
You always were.

1070
01:32:13,015 --> 01:32:16,746
- l love my family.
- Even your cousin Vincent?

1071
01:32:20,756 --> 01:32:22,519
l really love him.

1072
01:32:23,993 --> 01:32:28,225
- He's your first cousin.
- Then l love him first.

1073
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:31,060
Mary, you can't see him.

1074
01:32:31,167 --> 01:32:34,523
Just don't see him anymore.

1075
01:32:34,637 --> 01:32:38,459
He's right.
lt's too dangerous.

1076
01:32:41,043 --> 01:32:44,376
Listen to me.
You can't see him anymore.

1077
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,209
- Not in that fashion.
- No.

1078
01:32:48,050 --> 01:32:50,143
Please, promise me.

1079
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:53,718
- Obey me on this.
- No, Dad!

1080
01:32:59,161 --> 01:33:03,484
Mary's smart, Dad.
She'll understand eventually.

1081
01:33:40,469 --> 01:33:43,666
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

1082
01:33:43,772 --> 01:33:46,434
- l want you to do something for me.
- Okay.

1083
01:33:46,542 --> 01:33:48,965
lt's dangerous.

1084
01:33:49,078 --> 01:33:53,003
Good, l'm in.
What do you need?

1085
01:33:53,115 --> 01:33:56,812
l want you to sell your soul
to Don Altobello...

1086
01:33:56,919 --> 01:33:58,807
to betray me.

1087
01:34:02,157 --> 01:34:04,921
He'd never believe me.
Here.

1088
01:34:05,027 --> 01:34:07,257
- That depends.
- Sit down.

1089
01:34:10,499 --> 01:34:12,387
l have an idea.

1090
01:34:13,669 --> 01:34:17,560
See if you can learn
how high Altobello is connected.

1091
01:34:21,343 --> 01:34:23,231
Arrange a meeting.

1092
01:34:25,781 --> 01:34:30,912
You say how devoted you are to me.
Tell him your problems.

1093
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:33,909
- You ask for his help.
- What problems?

1094
01:34:36,091 --> 01:34:37,979
That you want to run away
with my daughter.

1095
01:34:39,628 --> 01:34:44,019
Only you know that if you do,
l will become your enemy.

1096
01:34:48,771 --> 01:34:51,001
You know l would never do that,
Uncle Mike.

1097
01:34:51,106 --> 01:34:52,164
l know.

1098
01:34:53,442 --> 01:34:56,366
You ask Altobello to speak to me...

1099
01:34:56,478 --> 01:34:58,434
to further the marriage.

1100
01:34:58,547 --> 01:35:00,845
But you're cousins, after all.

1101
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:04,374
Michael was always
a little old-fashioned.

1102
01:35:04,486 --> 01:35:05,544
Explain to him how...

1103
01:35:05,654 --> 01:35:07,918
you could never be a part
of my legitimate world...

1104
01:35:08,023 --> 01:35:09,581
that you want your own family.

1105
01:35:09,692 --> 01:35:13,583
l could straighten out
what Zasa left behind.

1106
01:35:15,331 --> 01:35:17,720
l could use your friendship
to persuade him.

1107
01:35:19,268 --> 01:35:21,657
l would be indebted to you forever.

1108
01:35:24,139 --> 01:35:28,030
Corleones know the value
of such a friend.

1109
01:35:29,511 --> 01:35:31,900
So then you would work for me?

1110
01:35:40,556 --> 01:35:42,217
Remember...

1111
01:35:42,324 --> 01:35:47,250
if he hints that he wants you
to betray me, get insulted...

1112
01:35:47,363 --> 01:35:49,285
because that's his trap.

1113
01:35:56,939 --> 01:35:59,828
You're not telling me
the whole truth.

1114
01:36:03,412 --> 01:36:07,143
lsn't it true, with Michael gone...

1115
01:36:07,249 --> 01:36:09,638
the girl controls everything?

1116
01:36:13,155 --> 01:36:15,248
You leave the girl out of this.

1117
01:36:15,357 --> 01:36:18,747
Of course, you love her,
and she loves you.

1118
01:36:39,682 --> 01:36:42,071
l guessed it, huh?

1119
01:36:43,719 --> 01:36:47,109
You're a wise man, Don Altobello.

1120
01:36:47,222 --> 01:36:49,850
l'm gonna be learning a lot
from you.

1121
01:36:49,958 --> 01:36:52,688
The richest man is the one
with the most powerful friends.

1122
01:36:55,464 --> 01:36:58,627
lt's my duty to make
the introductions.

1123
01:37:05,607 --> 01:37:07,495
Don Lucchesi.

1124
01:37:10,345 --> 01:37:12,973
Don Altobello tells me
you have a good character...

1125
01:37:13,082 --> 01:37:16,142
strong,
a man of respect.

1126
01:37:16,251 --> 01:37:20,039
This is the hero
who put Joey Zasa in his grave.

1127
01:37:20,155 --> 01:37:24,444
lf we'd have known of his existence,
we would never have backed Joey.

1128
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:26,448
No one wants another Joe.

1129
01:37:28,397 --> 01:37:29,694
Let me be your friend.

1130
01:37:31,433 --> 01:37:34,357
Even the strongest man needs friends.

1131
01:37:34,470 --> 01:37:36,859
l'm flattered.

1132
01:37:36,972 --> 01:37:39,566
You're a man of finance and politics,
Don Lucchesi.

1133
01:37:39,675 --> 01:37:41,563
These are things l don't understand.

1134
01:37:43,345 --> 01:37:44,573
You understand guns.

1135
01:37:45,514 --> 01:37:47,539
Finance is a gun.

1136
01:37:47,649 --> 01:37:52,245
Politics is knowing
when to pull the trigger.

1137
01:37:56,792 --> 01:37:58,020
How can l help?

1138
01:38:03,699 --> 01:38:06,293
Blessed is the peacemaker...

1139
01:38:06,401 --> 01:38:09,290
for he can be called
the child of God.

1140
01:38:45,507 --> 01:38:49,068
l trusted this business arrangement
with the archbishop.

1141
01:38:49,178 --> 01:38:54,275
l trusted him. l was sure
his honesty was beyond a doubt.

1142
01:38:54,383 --> 01:38:59,673
But, as you see,
l'm now the victim of a swindle.

1143
01:38:59,788 --> 01:39:01,676
He's stalling me.

1144
01:39:01,790 --> 01:39:05,749
Vast money have gone to the pezzonovante
in high political places...

1145
01:39:05,861 --> 01:39:08,591
and the Vatican Bank
is the guarantor.

1146
01:39:08,697 --> 01:39:13,953
lf what you say is true,
there will be a great scandal.

1147
01:39:15,938 --> 01:39:21,069
Look at this stone. lt has been lying
in the water for a very long time...

1148
01:39:21,176 --> 01:39:25,067
but the water has not penetrated it.

1149
01:39:29,117 --> 01:39:33,008
Look, perfectly dry.

1150
01:39:34,256 --> 01:39:36,622
The same thing has happened
to men in Europe.

1151
01:39:36,725 --> 01:39:41,617
For centuries, they have been
surrounded by Christianity...

1152
01:39:41,730 --> 01:39:44,255
but Christ has not penetrated.

1153
01:39:44,366 --> 01:39:47,756
Christ doesn't live within them.

1154
01:39:51,807 --> 01:39:53,934
- What's happening?
- ls it possible...

1155
01:39:54,042 --> 01:39:56,966
that you could get me something sweet.

1156
01:39:57,079 --> 01:39:59,468
Orange juice, anything, a candy.

1157
01:40:03,051 --> 01:40:05,110
l have a little trouble with diabetes.

1158
01:40:09,091 --> 01:40:10,979
Blood sugar goes low.

1159
01:40:12,127 --> 01:40:14,015
l understand.

1160
01:40:36,518 --> 01:40:40,181
When l'm under stress,
sometimes this happens.

1161
01:40:40,289 --> 01:40:42,177
l understand.

1162
01:40:44,026 --> 01:40:47,416
To come to you
on such a delicate matter...

1163
01:40:50,565 --> 01:40:53,523
accusations against your archbishop.

1164
01:40:53,635 --> 01:40:55,694
lt was difficult for me.

1165
01:40:56,939 --> 01:40:59,134
The mind suffers...

1166
01:40:59,241 --> 01:41:02,870
and the body cries out.

1167
01:41:07,716 --> 01:41:09,775
That's true.

1168
01:41:11,253 --> 01:41:15,576
Would you like to make
your confession?

1169
01:41:22,230 --> 01:41:24,289
Your Eminence, l'm--

1170
01:41:28,103 --> 01:41:29,832
lt's been so long.

1171
01:41:29,938 --> 01:41:33,328
l wouldn't know where to--

1172
01:41:35,077 --> 01:41:36,965
lt's been 30 years.

1173
01:41:39,114 --> 01:41:41,605
l'd use up too much of your time,
l think.

1174
01:41:41,717 --> 01:41:44,811
l always have time to save souls.

1175
01:41:46,221 --> 01:41:49,110
Well, l'm beyond redemption.

1176
01:42:00,435 --> 01:42:05,395
l hear the confessions
of my own priests here.

1177
01:42:05,507 --> 01:42:09,329
Sometimes the desire to confess
is overwhelming...

1178
01:42:09,444 --> 01:42:11,833
and we must seize the moment.

1179
01:42:16,852 --> 01:42:21,380
What is the point of confessing
if l don't repent?

1180
01:42:23,091 --> 01:42:26,390
l hear you are a practical man.

1181
01:42:26,495 --> 01:42:29,555
What have you got to lose, huh?

1182
01:42:40,475 --> 01:42:42,705
Go on.

1183
01:42:48,650 --> 01:42:50,049
l...

1184
01:42:51,186 --> 01:42:53,074
betrayed my wife.

1185
01:42:54,723 --> 01:42:56,611
Go on, my son.

1186
01:43:02,030 --> 01:43:03,918
l betrayed myself.

1187
01:43:06,802 --> 01:43:08,690
l killed men.

1188
01:43:12,441 --> 01:43:14,830
And l ordered men to be killed.

1189
01:43:16,478 --> 01:43:18,366
Go on, my son, go on.

1190
01:43:24,519 --> 01:43:25,747
lt's useless.

1191
01:43:27,823 --> 01:43:29,711
Go on, my son.

1192
01:43:30,826 --> 01:43:32,714
l killed--

1193
01:43:37,466 --> 01:43:41,129
l ordered the death of my brother.

1194
01:43:41,236 --> 01:43:43,124
He injured me.

1195
01:43:44,539 --> 01:43:47,133
l killed my mother's son.

1196
01:43:48,510 --> 01:43:50,603
l killed my father's son.

1197
01:44:01,323 --> 01:44:03,348
Your sins are terrible...

1198
01:44:03,458 --> 01:44:06,018
and it is just
that you suffer.

1199
01:44:07,295 --> 01:44:09,684
Your life could be redeemed...

1200
01:44:10,932 --> 01:44:12,820
but l know
that you don't believe that.

1201
01:44:12,934 --> 01:44:14,822
You will not change.

1202
01:45:10,425 --> 01:45:14,316
All my life
l kept trying to go up in society...

1203
01:45:15,564 --> 01:45:18,954
where everything higher up
was legal, straight.

1204
01:45:20,435 --> 01:45:23,495
But the higher l go,
the more crooked it becomes.

1205
01:45:26,775 --> 01:45:28,834
Where the hell does it end?

1206
01:45:37,919 --> 01:45:40,808
Killing each other
for centuries here.

1207
01:45:42,657 --> 01:45:47,014
For money, for pride, for family.

1208
01:45:50,098 --> 01:45:53,989
To keep from becoming the slaves
of the rich pezzonovante.

1209
01:46:01,142 --> 01:46:03,201
l made confession, Connie.

1210
01:46:04,312 --> 01:46:06,940
l confessed my sins.

1211
01:46:08,049 --> 01:46:10,540
Why, Michael?
That's not like you.

1212
01:46:10,652 --> 01:46:14,008
You don't have to confess your sins
to a stranger.

1213
01:46:14,122 --> 01:46:15,555
lt was the man.

1214
01:46:16,958 --> 01:46:19,085
A good man...

1215
01:46:19,194 --> 01:46:21,082
a true priest.

1216
01:46:24,799 --> 01:46:26,687
He can change things.

1217
01:46:32,073 --> 01:46:33,802
You know...

1218
01:46:33,908 --> 01:46:37,298
sometimes l think of poor Fredo--
drowned.

1219
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:40,768
lt was God's will.

1220
01:46:42,651 --> 01:46:45,040
lt was a terrible accident.

1221
01:46:46,154 --> 01:46:48,042
But it's finished.

1222
01:46:53,461 --> 01:46:55,349
Michael, l love you.

1223
01:46:57,732 --> 01:46:59,620
l'll always help you.

1224
01:47:09,444 --> 01:47:11,332
lt's okay.

1225
01:49:51,473 --> 01:49:53,964
- Welcome.
- How are you?

1226
01:49:54,075 --> 01:49:57,567
- Mary, l missed you.
- l missed you too.

1227
01:49:57,679 --> 01:49:59,567
- Hello, Michael.
- Hello.

1228
01:49:59,681 --> 01:50:01,740
- Mom, look at this.
- What?

1229
01:50:03,418 --> 01:50:05,147
Oh, my--

1230
01:50:05,253 --> 01:50:07,380
You know, it's too bad
that Douglas couldn't be with us.

1231
01:50:07,489 --> 01:50:11,186
No, l know. He wanted to come very much,
but he had a very important trial.

1232
01:50:11,292 --> 01:50:14,420
- l know he wanted to come.
- l know.

1233
01:50:14,529 --> 01:50:16,417
- The car is--
- Okay.

1234
01:50:18,466 --> 01:50:22,527
Well, your son's an artist, huh?

1235
01:50:22,637 --> 01:50:24,730
Oh, yes, thanks to you.

1236
01:50:24,839 --> 01:50:26,238
Oh, what for?

1237
01:50:27,408 --> 01:50:29,672
For making me let him go.

1238
01:50:29,777 --> 01:50:31,665
Oh, well.

1239
01:50:31,779 --> 01:50:35,510
After all these years, here l am
in Sicily for the first time.

1240
01:50:35,617 --> 01:50:38,006
- l want a picture of you together.
- Okay.

1241
01:50:40,688 --> 01:50:42,576
Hey, Dad, smile.

1242
01:50:46,561 --> 01:50:49,792
l see you still have Al Neri.
Why?

1243
01:50:51,232 --> 01:50:55,464
Well, l need him. He helps me
get in and out of the car.

1244
01:50:55,570 --> 01:50:57,868
He carries my briefcase.

1245
01:50:57,972 --> 01:51:00,668
You're still a liar, Michael.

1246
01:51:00,775 --> 01:51:04,233
Let me show you Sicily--
the real Sicily.

1247
01:51:04,345 --> 01:51:07,143
Maybe you'll understand
the family history a little better.

1248
01:51:07,248 --> 01:51:09,637
l think l understand it well enough.

1249
01:52:01,669 --> 01:52:05,059
Anthony, l have something
you made for me...

1250
01:52:06,274 --> 01:52:08,162
a very long time ago.

1251
01:52:09,344 --> 01:52:12,472
- To bring you luck.
- Thanks.

1252
01:52:16,217 --> 01:52:17,775
You saved it, huh?

1253
01:52:17,885 --> 01:52:20,376
- Remember?
- l remember.

1254
01:52:22,924 --> 01:52:24,812
Thank you.

1255
01:52:27,095 --> 01:52:28,494
Proud of you.

1256
01:52:29,430 --> 01:52:30,988
Thank you.

1257
01:52:47,181 --> 01:52:49,809
- Are they as good as they look?
- They're better.

1258
01:52:49,917 --> 01:52:52,442
They're the best.

1259
01:52:52,553 --> 01:52:54,748
As long as they're around,
Uncle Michael is safe.

1260
01:52:54,889 --> 01:52:56,254
Good-bye.

1261
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:01,316
Tell your father
l'll be back for dinner.

1262
01:53:03,097 --> 01:53:05,759
- Have fun.
- Tell Tony to be sure and wait for me.

1263
01:53:05,867 --> 01:53:08,495
Okay, l will.

1264
01:53:08,603 --> 01:53:10,901
Bye, Mom!

1265
01:53:11,005 --> 01:53:13,235
At your service.

1266
01:53:16,844 --> 01:53:20,234
lf l see Dad,
l'll tell him you left.

1267
01:53:25,453 --> 01:53:29,378
You're the only one left in this family
with my father's strength.

1268
01:53:31,626 --> 01:53:36,222
lf anything happens to Michael,
l want you to strike back.

1269
01:53:38,700 --> 01:53:40,258
l'll have everything ready.

1270
01:53:44,038 --> 01:53:45,926
You swear?

1271
01:53:53,047 --> 01:53:55,106
l swear to you.

1272
01:54:25,313 --> 01:54:27,201
Here it is.

1273
01:54:28,616 --> 01:54:30,675
The house where my father was born.

1274
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:36,711
This is where they came to take him
when he was a boy...

1275
01:54:36,824 --> 01:54:38,712
to kill him.

1276
01:54:41,028 --> 01:54:44,418
Wait, listen to that.

1277
01:55:04,685 --> 01:55:08,143
You know, Mary's in love.

1278
01:55:08,256 --> 01:55:10,781
Yes, l know.

1279
01:55:10,892 --> 01:55:16,023
With a handsome young ltalian man
with dark eyes.

1280
01:55:16,130 --> 01:55:18,018
l won't allow it.

1281
01:55:20,835 --> 01:55:24,532
lt's wrong.
lt's wrong, and it's dangerous.

1282
01:55:56,871 --> 01:55:58,532
Honor, huh?

1283
01:56:17,992 --> 01:56:20,950
You know, l remember the time
you came to my parents' house...

1284
01:56:21,062 --> 01:56:24,361
and you took me into that room
and told me about the family business...

1285
01:56:24,465 --> 01:56:28,162
and how you were never going to have
anything to do with it.

1286
01:56:28,269 --> 01:56:30,601
You sounded like Tony.

1287
01:56:30,705 --> 01:56:32,593
l was a lot like Tony.

1288
01:56:40,214 --> 01:56:43,172
- l can barely see. Kay.
- What?

1289
01:56:43,284 --> 01:56:45,946
- You mind driving?
- No. What's wrong?

1290
01:56:46,053 --> 01:56:49,682
My eyes-- sometimes
they're all right, and then--

1291
01:56:49,790 --> 01:56:52,918
- Sure.
- Listen, l have to see Don Tommasino.

1292
01:56:54,996 --> 01:56:56,759
Oh, my God!

1293
01:56:56,864 --> 01:56:58,263
Well--

1294
01:56:59,433 --> 01:57:02,823
- There's no bodyguards today.
- l really snuck away.

1295
01:57:56,023 --> 01:57:57,786
- How are you?
- Hi.

1296
01:57:57,892 --> 01:57:59,780
- Kay, this is Calo, my old friend.
- How do you do?

1297
01:57:59,894 --> 01:58:01,782
One of my bodyguards
in the old days.

1298
01:58:07,201 --> 01:58:08,600
- We can wait here.
- You want drink?

1299
01:58:08,703 --> 01:58:12,093
- Yes. Shall we go in?
- Sure.

1300
01:58:14,675 --> 01:58:17,064
l spent a lot of time in this room...

1301
01:58:19,413 --> 01:58:21,142
thinking of you.

1302
01:58:24,285 --> 01:58:26,845
And then you got married.

1303
01:58:30,024 --> 01:58:31,582
l still thought of you.

1304
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:34,248
What's in that room?

1305
01:58:38,065 --> 01:58:42,354
l know this is dangerous for you.
This is Sicily.

1306
01:58:44,705 --> 01:58:47,094
- l love this country.
- Why?

1307
01:58:49,810 --> 01:58:53,166
Well, all through history...

1308
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:55,612
terrible things
have happened to these people.

1309
01:58:55,716 --> 01:58:58,514
Terrible injustices.

1310
01:58:59,620 --> 01:59:04,853
But they still expect good
rather than bad will happen to them.

1311
01:59:04,959 --> 01:59:07,348
Sort of like me and you, huh?

1312
01:59:11,432 --> 01:59:14,788
- How so?
- l'm still here, right?

1313
01:59:14,902 --> 01:59:16,392
We do have a bad history.

1314
01:59:17,338 --> 01:59:20,762
- l'm still here.
- Yes, you are, but with dread.

1315
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:27,442
Give me the order. Come on.

1316
01:59:27,548 --> 01:59:30,278
What is that supposed to do? ls that
supposed to make me not dread you?

1317
01:59:33,554 --> 01:59:35,943
We're in Sicily. lt's opera.

1318
01:59:38,359 --> 01:59:39,758
Okay.

1319
01:59:42,196 --> 01:59:44,255
What do we do now?

1320
01:59:47,068 --> 01:59:49,127
Be reasonable.

1321
01:59:49,236 --> 01:59:51,124
Let's try not to hurt each other.

1322
01:59:58,512 --> 02:00:00,400
l want you to forgive me.

1323
02:00:03,184 --> 02:00:04,242
For what?

1324
02:00:05,352 --> 02:00:06,910
Everything.

1325
02:00:11,192 --> 02:00:12,921
Like God, huh?

1326
02:00:14,161 --> 02:00:16,686
l need something a little closer.

1327
02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:22,355
You couldn't understand
back in those days...

1328
02:00:24,238 --> 02:00:26,160
l loved my father.

1329
02:00:26,273 --> 02:00:29,162
l swore l would never be
a man like him...

1330
02:00:29,276 --> 02:00:31,767
but l loved him,
and he was in danger.

1331
02:00:31,879 --> 02:00:33,767
What could l do?

1332
02:00:33,881 --> 02:00:37,146
And then later
you were in danger.

1333
02:00:37,251 --> 02:00:41,676
Our children were in danger.
What could l do?

1334
02:00:41,789 --> 02:00:45,281
You were all that l... loved...

1335
02:00:45,392 --> 02:00:47,781
valued most in the world.

1336
02:00:48,896 --> 02:00:51,456
And now l'm losing you.
l lost you anyway.

1337
02:00:52,666 --> 02:00:54,554
You're gone...

1338
02:00:55,669 --> 02:00:57,899
and it was all for nothing.

1339
02:00:58,005 --> 02:00:59,404
So--

1340
02:01:03,244 --> 02:01:05,804
You have to understand...

1341
02:01:05,913 --> 02:01:08,404
l had a whole different
destiny planned.

1342
02:01:11,986 --> 02:01:14,181
All right, l'll stop.

1343
02:01:24,398 --> 02:01:28,095
l really don't know what you want
from me, Michael. l really don't know.

1344
02:01:28,202 --> 02:01:33,333
- l mean--
- l'm not the man that you think l am?

1345
02:01:34,875 --> 02:01:38,732
- l don't know.
- l love you, Kay.

1346
02:01:39,947 --> 02:01:42,905
Don't dread me anymore.

1347
02:01:47,855 --> 02:01:50,085
You know...

1348
02:01:50,191 --> 02:01:52,580
every night here in Sicily...

1349
02:01:53,827 --> 02:01:55,522
l dream...

1350
02:01:56,864 --> 02:01:59,253
about my wife
and my children...

1351
02:02:02,503 --> 02:02:04,926
and how l lost them.

1352
02:02:06,607 --> 02:02:10,202
l guess, if it's any consolation...

1353
02:02:10,311 --> 02:02:12,302
l want you to know that...

1354
02:02:15,683 --> 02:02:17,082
that...

1355
02:02:18,352 --> 02:02:20,741
l always loved you, Michael.

1356
02:02:22,089 --> 02:02:25,422
And, you know...

1357
02:02:25,526 --> 02:02:27,915
l always will.

1358
02:03:26,320 --> 02:03:28,049
lt never ends.

1359
02:05:00,347 --> 02:05:02,269
Frederick Keinszig...

1360
02:05:02,383 --> 02:05:04,715
known for a decade as ''God's banker''...

1361
02:05:04,818 --> 02:05:06,740
has been reported missing.

1362
02:05:06,854 --> 02:05:08,742
He was last seen three days ago...

1363
02:05:08,856 --> 02:05:10,255
leaving the Rome offices...

1364
02:05:10,357 --> 02:05:14,123
of a Vatican-owned corporation,
International Immobiliare.

1365
02:05:14,228 --> 02:05:16,253
Also missing was a large sum of money...

1366
02:05:16,363 --> 02:05:18,388
and several documents.

1367
02:05:18,499 --> 02:05:20,888
Come on, Keinszig, you fool.

1368
02:05:24,905 --> 02:05:27,294
Mr. Keinszig's absence casts
further suspicion...

1369
02:05:27,408 --> 02:05:29,831
on the dealings
of the Vatican Bank.

1370
02:05:29,943 --> 02:05:32,776
For several years, the bank
and its subsidiary companies...

1371
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:37,340
have been the object of allegations
of disreputable business practices.

1372
02:05:39,653 --> 02:05:42,542
Will you please try and understand?

1373
02:05:43,657 --> 02:05:45,579
l have phoned him.

1374
02:05:45,692 --> 02:05:48,081
l have waited here by the phone.

1375
02:05:50,597 --> 02:05:55,330
You would do well to remember,
Mr. Lucchesi...

1376
02:05:55,436 --> 02:06:00,430
that this pope
has very different ideas...

1377
02:06:00,541 --> 02:06:02,497
from the last one.

1378
02:06:24,064 --> 02:06:26,453
Good-bye, my old friend.

1379
02:06:28,168 --> 02:06:30,557
You could've lived
a little longer.

1380
02:06:32,272 --> 02:06:35,161
l could be closer to my dream.

1381
02:06:41,081 --> 02:06:43,641
You were so loved, Don Tommasino.

1382
02:06:48,655 --> 02:06:52,546
Why was l so feared,
and you were so loved?

1383
02:06:53,660 --> 02:06:56,151
What was it?

1384
02:06:56,230 --> 02:06:58,118
l was no less honorable.

1385
02:07:00,266 --> 02:07:02,154
l wanted to do good.

1386
02:07:06,472 --> 02:07:09,361
What betrayed me?
My mind? My heart?

1387
02:07:12,411 --> 02:07:14,800
Why do l condemn myself so?

1388
02:07:21,320 --> 02:07:25,711
l swear on the lives of my children...

1389
02:07:30,329 --> 02:07:33,218
give me a chance
to redeem myself...

1390
02:07:37,103 --> 02:07:40,994
and l will sin no more.

1391
02:08:04,163 --> 02:08:09,055
You look pale.
Bad news? Tell me right away.

1392
02:08:10,736 --> 02:08:14,263
lt's not just a bad banking deal.

1393
02:08:14,373 --> 02:08:16,261
These guys are butchers.

1394
02:08:17,576 --> 02:08:19,464
What guys?

1395
02:08:19,578 --> 02:08:23,571
Lucchesi--
he controls all of them.

1396
02:08:23,683 --> 02:08:26,572
Altobello, the archbishop...

1397
02:08:27,687 --> 02:08:30,451
other people higher up,
P2, maybe.

1398
02:08:30,556 --> 02:08:34,413
Secret, unknown.
They're running things.

1399
02:08:37,330 --> 02:08:40,219
- l'm in their way.
- Yeah.

1400
02:08:40,333 --> 02:08:42,756
He's hired a professional assassin
to kill you.

1401
02:08:42,868 --> 02:08:44,426
He's Sicilian.

1402
02:08:44,537 --> 02:08:48,928
l don't know his name,
but they say he never fails.

1403
02:08:51,077 --> 02:08:52,965
Then no one is safe.

1404
02:08:56,015 --> 02:08:58,404
Even the new pope
is in danger.

1405
02:08:59,585 --> 02:09:03,476
We still have time.
We can prevent this.

1406
02:09:08,027 --> 02:09:09,915
l tried.

1407
02:09:12,498 --> 02:09:17,390
l tried to keep everything
from coming to this.

1408
02:09:18,571 --> 02:09:23,565
But it's not possible,
not in this world.

1409
02:09:24,677 --> 02:09:26,599
Give me the order.

1410
02:09:30,149 --> 02:09:32,037
You won't be able to go back.

1411
02:09:33,352 --> 02:09:36,480
- You'll be like me.
- Good.

1412
02:09:36,589 --> 02:09:40,013
All my life l wanted out.

1413
02:09:40,126 --> 02:09:42,014
l wanted the family out.

1414
02:09:43,863 --> 02:09:46,024
Well, l don't want out.

1415
02:09:46,132 --> 02:09:49,522
l want the power
to preserve the family.

1416
02:09:54,173 --> 02:09:56,061
l'm asking for the order.

1417
02:10:17,129 --> 02:10:19,017
lt's done.

1418
02:10:20,466 --> 02:10:22,388
Because l can't do it anymore.

1419
02:10:26,605 --> 02:10:28,937
Well, it doesn't matter.

1420
02:10:29,041 --> 02:10:32,306
Vincent knows what to do.
Come on outside.

1421
02:10:32,411 --> 02:10:35,835
Take a rest
and don't think about it.

1422
02:10:35,948 --> 02:10:38,837
- All l do is think about it.
- l'm your son.

1423
02:10:40,119 --> 02:10:42,007
Command me in all things.

1424
02:10:44,623 --> 02:10:46,511
Give up my daughter.

1425
02:10:49,595 --> 02:10:51,483
That's the price you pay...

1426
02:10:52,765 --> 02:10:55,495
for the life you choose.

1427
02:11:21,227 --> 02:11:23,115
Nephew...

1428
02:11:25,097 --> 02:11:26,985
from this moment on...

1429
02:11:28,934 --> 02:11:30,822
call yourself Vincent Corleone.

1430
02:11:35,941 --> 02:11:37,340
Sit.

1431
02:13:43,435 --> 02:13:46,563
l know how you feel about Michael...

1432
02:13:46,672 --> 02:13:48,503
but you can't save him.

1433
02:13:48,607 --> 02:13:50,495
He's lost.

1434
02:13:52,211 --> 02:13:53,701
Think of yourself.

1435
02:13:55,014 --> 02:13:57,403
What's your answer?

1436
02:13:59,618 --> 02:14:01,506
Enjoy the opera.

1437
02:14:03,555 --> 02:14:05,443
lt's all taken care of.

1438
02:14:10,295 --> 02:14:12,684
Check the bar.
l'll check the top floor.

1439
02:14:17,002 --> 02:14:19,891
''Here's hoping Tony sings better
at the Theatro Massimo...

1440
02:14:20,005 --> 02:14:22,394
than he does in the shower--
Love, Douglas.''

1441
02:14:24,176 --> 02:14:26,064
My darling, Costanza.

1442
02:14:28,814 --> 02:14:31,203
- This is a great occasion.
- Come, sit down.

1443
02:14:36,321 --> 02:14:38,209
Happy birthday.

1444
02:14:38,323 --> 02:14:40,848
You're 80 years old,
you don't look more than 60.

1445
02:14:40,959 --> 02:14:42,586
You're the only one
who remembered.

1446
02:14:42,695 --> 02:14:45,061
Michael, we just got the word.

1447
02:14:45,164 --> 02:14:48,361
The pope's ratifying
the lmmobiliare deal. We've won.

1448
02:14:48,467 --> 02:14:50,355
Congratulations.

1449
02:14:53,138 --> 02:14:55,527
How strange, the way things work.

1450
02:14:55,641 --> 02:14:59,031
The pope's doing exactly what you said
he'd do. He's cleaning house.

1451
02:15:00,546 --> 02:15:05,108
He should be careful.
lt's dangerous to be an honest man.

1452
02:15:10,589 --> 02:15:12,978
l wanna put more muscle backstage
with Tony.

1453
02:15:25,704 --> 02:15:29,094
On your birthday,
you used to shower me with treats.

1454
02:15:29,208 --> 02:15:31,096
Tootsie Rolls.

1455
02:15:32,211 --> 02:15:35,169
The nuns who made these cannolis
took a vow of silence.

1456
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:37,840
They're the very finest.

1457
02:15:43,255 --> 02:15:44,654
Hey, cous.

1458
02:15:47,659 --> 02:15:49,092
Where's your leather?

1459
02:15:52,831 --> 02:15:54,264
Stop it.

1460
02:16:00,439 --> 02:16:03,328
You're so thin.
You eat it.

1461
02:16:27,232 --> 02:16:31,623
lt's over. There are things l have to do
that you can't be a part of.

1462
02:16:31,737 --> 02:16:34,831
Don't look at your father. lt's not
your father's decision. lt's mine.

1463
02:16:36,575 --> 02:16:38,964
Don't hate your father.

1464
02:16:40,746 --> 02:16:44,568
There are things l wanna be a part of,
you can't be around.

1465
02:16:46,618 --> 02:16:49,007
After tonight,
you won't see me anymore.

1466
02:16:53,826 --> 02:16:56,522
You gotta understand.
You gotta understand.

1467
02:16:58,397 --> 02:17:00,285
l'll always love you.

1468
02:17:13,212 --> 02:17:14,702
Love somebody else.

1469
02:17:37,469 --> 02:17:39,357
- To Tony.
- To Tony.

1470
02:20:56,201 --> 02:21:00,262
- They won't try.anything.
- Yeah, everything is fine. lt's clear.

1471
02:21:00,372 --> 02:21:03,432
l've already sent Al Neri
to the Vatican.

1472
02:23:52,844 --> 02:23:55,074
Check out the side.

1473
02:26:18,623 --> 02:26:21,512
Good. You got him.

1474
02:27:13,378 --> 02:27:15,767
Tonight the Corleone family
settles its accounts.

1475
02:27:16,881 --> 02:27:18,803
Keinszig...

1476
02:27:18,917 --> 02:27:22,375
that little Swiss banker fuck.

1477
02:27:22,487 --> 02:27:27,151
He's been swindling everyone
from the beginning. Fuck him.

1478
02:27:28,092 --> 02:27:29,980
Don Lucchesi, my friend...

1479
02:27:30,929 --> 02:27:33,853
Calo will pay him a visit
at his home.

1480
02:27:36,134 --> 02:27:39,023
Neri, take a train to Rome.

1481
02:27:41,105 --> 02:27:42,993
Light a candle
for the archbishop.

1482
02:29:46,397 --> 02:29:49,855
Michael, it's serious.
Our man inside the Vatican says...

1483
02:29:49,968 --> 02:29:51,367
there's a plot
against the pope.

1484
02:29:51,469 --> 02:29:53,630
You mean, he's gonna have
a heart attack?

1485
02:30:00,912 --> 02:30:05,804
This pope has powerful enemies.
We may not be in time to save him.

1486
02:30:09,053 --> 02:30:10,452
Let's go back to the opera.

1487
02:32:35,366 --> 02:32:36,424
Sleep.

1488
02:32:37,635 --> 02:32:39,523
Sleep, Godfather.

1489
02:36:28,866 --> 02:36:31,061
- l like this outfit.
- Yeah, l figured you would.

1490
02:36:31,168 --> 02:36:33,659
- Bravo. Say hello.
- Thank you.

1491
02:36:39,844 --> 02:36:42,074
- Did you like it?
- Great.

1492
02:36:43,914 --> 02:36:46,246
Let's get out of here.

1493
02:36:55,826 --> 02:36:59,592
- Can l please talk to you now?
- Not now, it's not a good time.

1494
02:36:59,697 --> 02:37:03,588
- You're just like my father.
- Come on, stay with the family. Go on.

1495
02:37:05,136 --> 02:37:06,899
- Talk to me.
- The twins are dead.

1496
02:37:07,004 --> 02:37:10,895
ln about one minute, there's gonna be
carabinieri crawling all over the place.

1497
02:37:12,209 --> 02:37:14,769
Okay. Let's get everybody
to the cars, nice and quiet.

1498
02:37:14,879 --> 02:37:16,767
- Got it.
- Quiet.

1499
02:37:31,395 --> 02:37:34,489
When they hear the name Corleone,
they're gonna think of a voice.

1500
02:37:44,442 --> 02:37:46,137
Dad.

1501
02:37:54,118 --> 02:37:55,608
This is my mom.

1502
02:38:04,962 --> 02:38:08,989
Dad, why are you doing this to me?

1503
02:38:18,042 --> 02:38:21,466
- Go on, move back. Go on, move back.
- Hey, move!

1504
02:38:21,579 --> 02:38:24,776
- You don't have to do this to me.
- Doing what?

1505
02:38:24,882 --> 02:38:27,476
What do you mean?

1506
02:38:27,585 --> 02:38:29,177
Mary, will you please--

1507
02:38:52,610 --> 02:38:53,668
Dad--

1508
02:39:12,496 --> 02:39:15,385
- Maybe she's not dead.
- Oh, God!

1509
02:39:19,503 --> 02:39:21,391
God, no, please!

1510
02:39:23,641 --> 02:39:25,040
Mom, come on.

1511
02:39:42,393 --> 02:39:43,792
Let her go.

1512
02:39:49,166 --> 02:39:51,054
Let go.
