1
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:33,091
I know you.

2
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,971
You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family... right?

3
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:42,976
I think you and I can do business.

4
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:47,481
I need someone strong like you.

5
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,943
I heard you are not happy...

6
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:53,654
... with the Corleone family.

7
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,156
Want to join me?

8
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:59,284
What's in it for me?

9
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,831
$50,000 to start with.

10
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,085
Not bad!

11
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,380
Agreed?

12
01:37:39,604 --> 01:37:42,231
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

13
01:37:47,779 --> 01:37:49,780
Why are you so far
from the house?

14
01:37:50,448 --> 01:37:53,116
You know I'm responsible to your
father for your life.

15
01:37:53,201 --> 01:37:54,493
The bodyguards are here.

16
01:37:55,411 --> 01:37:56,745
It's still dangerous...

17
01:37:57,872 --> 01:37:59,623
We've heard from Santino
in New York...

18
01:38:01,042 --> 01:38:03,293
Your enemies know you're here.

19
01:38:05,296 --> 01:38:07,047
Did Santino say when
I can go back?

20
01:38:07,715 --> 01:38:09,007
Not yet.

21
01:38:09,676 --> 01:38:11,510
It's out of the question.

22
01:38:14,973 --> 01:38:16,390
Where are you going now?

23
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:20,978
Take my car.

24
01:38:24,315 --> 01:38:25,357
I want to walk.

25
01:38:27,986 --> 01:38:29,152
Be careful.

26
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:05,063
Where have all the men gone?

27
01:39:06,107 --> 01:39:08,317
They're all dead from vendettas.

28
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:12,362
There are the names of the dead.

29
01:40:00,578 --> 01:40:02,621
Mamma mia what a beauty.

30
01:40:10,797 --> 01:40:13,882
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

31
01:40:20,098 --> 01:40:24,101
In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

32
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:48,959
Did you have a good hunt?

33
01:40:49,919 --> 01:40:52,295
You know all the girls
around here?

34
01:40:52,797 --> 01:40:54,297
We saw some real beauties.

35
01:40:55,133 --> 01:40:58,635
One of them struck our friend
like a thunderbolt.

36
01:41:01,848 --> 01:41:04,599
She would tempt the devil himself.

37
01:41:12,233 --> 01:41:14,401
Really put together.

38
01:41:19,282 --> 01:41:21,283
Such hair, such mouth!

39
01:41:23,661 --> 01:41:26,830
The girls around here are
beautiful...but virtuous.

40
01:41:27,373 --> 01:41:29,750
This one had a purple dress...

41
01:41:30,126 --> 01:41:32,252
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

42
01:41:33,129 --> 01:41:36,298
A type more Greek than Italian.

43
01:41:38,718 --> 01:41:40,552
Do you know her?

44
01:41:44,974 --> 01:41:47,768
There's no girl like that
in this town.

45
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:51,688
My God, I understand!

46
01:41:55,818 --> 01:41:56,818
What's wrong?

47
01:41:59,030 --> 01:42:00,405
Let's go.

48
01:42:02,366 --> 01:42:03,617
It's his daughter.

49
01:42:04,076 --> 01:42:05,577
Tell him to come here.

50
01:42:08,998 --> 01:42:10,332
Call him.

51
01:42:30,394 --> 01:42:32,729
Fabrizio, you translate.

52
01:43:37,795 --> 01:43:41,798
Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.

53
01:43:47,305 --> 01:43:48,805
What's her name?

54
02:03:41,998 --> 02:03:45,250
It's safer to teach you English!

55
02:03:46,002 --> 02:03:47,419
I know English...

56
02:03:59,516 --> 02:04:01,308
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

57
02:04:02,018 --> 02:04:04,019
How are things in Palermo?

58
02:04:10,026 --> 02:04:14,071
Michael is teaching me to
drive... watch, I'll show you.

59
02:04:16,866 --> 02:04:18,700
How are things in Palermo?

60
02:04:19,077 --> 02:04:22,204
Young people don't respect
anything anymore...

61
02:04:23,289 --> 02:04:26,667
Times are changing for the worse.

62
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:32,339
This place has become
too dangerous for you.

63
02:04:35,051 --> 02:04:40,222
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa... right now.

64
02:04:46,229 --> 02:04:47,396
What's wrong?

65
02:04:48,523 --> 02:04:50,732
Bad news from America.

66
02:04:53,194 --> 02:04:56,905
Your brother, Santino,
they killed him.

67
02:05:03,496 --> 02:05:05,330
Let's go... you promised.

68
02:05:25,226 --> 02:05:26,643
Get the car.

69
02:05:43,786 --> 02:05:45,537
Calo, where is Apollonia?

70
02:05:46,289 --> 02:05:49,791
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

71
02:05:52,086 --> 02:05:54,129
She'll make a good American wife.

72
02:05:55,590 --> 02:05:58,133
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

73
02:06:10,647 --> 02:06:12,314
Where are you going?

74
02:06:14,025 --> 02:06:16,443
Wait there! I'll drive to you.
