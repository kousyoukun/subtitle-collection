安东尼 完成法律学位课程
Anthony, finish the Law degree.

140
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,890
不要!
No.

141
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,300
这句"不要"可是得自于你
Well, that he got from you. That "no."

142
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,180
凯 你刚才应该帮我说服他
You could have helped me to convince him, Kay.

143
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,640
是吗? 说服他干什么?
Oh, convince him of what?

144
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,180
干什么?
Of what?

145
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,480
他糟蹋了自己的人生
He throws his life away.

146
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,310
他抛弃了自己将有的伟业
He throws greatness away.

147
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,520
这叫做伟业?
This is greatness?

148
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,110
麦克 你知道吗 你现在那么受人尊敬
You know Michael, now that you're so respectable

149
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,920
我反而觉得你更加可怕
I think you're more dangerous than you ever were.

150
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:34,390
其实我反而更喜欢还是普通帮派分子时的你
In fact, I preferred you when you were just a common Mafia hood.

151
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:39,500
- 好了 讲讲道理好不好? - 好
- Kay, now can we talk common sense here? - All right.

152
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,940

你来这里到底是为了什么?
What did you come here for?

155
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,920
来保护我儿子
I came here to protect my son.

156
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,590
我不是来看教廷褒扬你
I didn't come here to see you disguised by your church.

157
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,830
在我看来这场典礼很可耻
I think that was a shameful ceremony.

158
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,400
我一辈子都在保护我的儿子
I spent my life protecting my son.

159

在保护我的家庭!

你讲讲道理好吗?
Let's be reasonable, Okay?

161
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,940
你不是最讲道理的吗?
That's your big thing, isn't it, Michael?

162
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:27,950
用杀人 来建立的道理
Reason. Backed up by murder.

163

天啊你恨我 你恨我

凯 我尽我所能来保护你们
I did what I could,  Kay, to protect all of you

168
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,400
不受世上的恐怖威胁
from the horrors of this world.

169
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:53,510
你却成为了我的恐惧
But you became my horror.

170
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:06,990
可子孩子们依然爱你 尤其是玛莉
The children still love you though. Especially Mary.

171
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:15,530
这一点很重要 我们可以从这一点上下手
That's something. We can build on that

172
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,640
为了他们
For their sake.

173
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,440
我们试试吧
Let's try.

174
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,510
除非你让安东尼走自己的路
Only if you let Tony go free to have his own life.

175
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,920
远离你
Away from you.

176
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,550
我让安东尼走
I'll let Tony go.

177

你那鞋都能用来做武器了
You could hurt somebody with those.

179
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,100

你能不能帮我安排采访麦克柯里昂?
Can you get me an interview with Michael Corleone?

181
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,410
不行 虽然我是他的亲属也帮不上忙
Uh, no. I'm a relative but I can't do that.

182
00:19:30,445 --> 00:19:32,880
还有其他可以为你效劳的吗?

绣花枕头一个

Yeah, but I like to win. How will I know what numbers to pick?

189

你看我像个输家吗?
Do I look okay like a guy who's gonna lose?

190
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:54,860
那个人一脸凶相吓人
Spooky looking guy there.

191
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:58,000
这种凶煞来柯家干什么?
What is a guy like that doing at Michael Corleone's house?

很好!
Good.

277
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,780
那么就是我的麻烦了
Then it's my problem.

278
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,520
麦克 你认得文森
Michael, you know Vincent Mancini

279
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,290
大哥的遗孤
Sonny's boy.

280
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,690
柯里昂先生 你好吗?
How you doin' Mr. Corleone?

281
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,860
你好吗?
How you doing?

282
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,120
很好 你好吗?
I'm doin' good. How you doin'?

283
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,890
- 很好! - 好一场盛宴
- Good. - Good party.

284
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,960
你喜欢?
Oh you like it?

285
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,460
是 我溜进来的
Yeah, I had to sneak in.

286
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,240
至少你盛装前来
Well, you're dressed for it.

287
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:39,680
你和札萨先生有什么过节吗?
So, what's the trouble between you and Mr. Joe Zasa?

288
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:43,240
小麻烦 我会摆平
There's trouble. I'll take care of it.

289
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,350
你这样非常愚蠢
That's foolish of you.

290
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,110
我愚蠢?
Foolish of ME?

291
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,450
这家伙才愚蠢
It's a little foolish of this guy

292
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,190
对不对?
Don't you think?

293
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,920
对不对? 对不对?
Right? RIGHT?

294
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,860
脾气火爆还真像他爸
Temper like his father.

295
00:25:55,870 --> 00:26:01,190
文森 目前札萨先生拥有…
Vincent. Mr. Joe Zasa now owns

296
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,760
昔日柯里昂家在纽约的生意
what used to be the Corleone family business, in New York.

297
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:08,770
他好意把你安插在他帮中
Out of the kindness of his heart he gave you a job in his family.

298
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,700
你不听我劝硬要接受
Contrary to my advice, you took the job.

299
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:15,380
我给你提供一了个更好的合法工作
I'd offered you something, better, in the legitimate world.

300
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,940
你回绝了
You turned me down.

301
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,980
现在你们结了怨便来找我
Now, you both come to me with this bad blood.

302
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,160
你还指望我怎么做?
And what do you expect me to do?

303
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,220
难道我是个流氓头吗?
Am I a gangster?

304
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,320
不是!你不是流氓头
No, you're not a gangster.

305
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,990
爸爸的以前的老邻里都被搞得乌烟瘴气
That's was Papa's neighborhood, now it's a sewer.

306
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,190
札萨根本没有用心在打理
Zasa runs it like a disgrace that's what the women tell me.

307
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,130
康妮 那是旧事
That's the past Connie.

308
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,860
我靠自己的本事赚得那块地盘
I earned that territory with my talent.

309
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:38,700
帮会分配给我 你也同意
Commission gave it to me, and you approved.

310
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,870
是的!
Yes.

311
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,130
麦克叔
Uncle Michael

312
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,770
我来赴宴不是求援
I came to the party here I'm not here to ask for any kind of help

313
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,940
我完全杀的了这混帐
I could just kill this bastard

314
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,000
需要帮助的是他
He's the one who needs the help.

315
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,910
那杀了他啊
So kill him

316
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:50,810
你们的事和我有什么关系?
What has all this have to do with me?

317
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,020
背着你他经常骂
Well, he's going around behind your back saying

318
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,510
"去他妈的麦克柯里昂"
fuck Michael Corleone all time.

319
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,150
这跟你相干了吧
That's it, see, that's one thing it has to do with you

320
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,950
当他的面骂一次 当他的面骂一次啊！
Say it to his face, one time. Say it to his face, one time!

321
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,420
柯里昂先生 混蛋都撒谎
Mr. Corleone, all bastards are liars.

322
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,290
莎士比亚的诗句中都这么写
Shakespeare wrote poems about it.

323
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,660
麦克叔 我该怎么处置他?
What am I gonna do with this guy, Uncle Michael?

324
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,700
怎么处置他?
WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH THIS GUY?

325
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,640
乔
Joey

326
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:19,810
如有人在市里到处跑
If there's some guy running around this city

327
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:23,050
还骂"妈的麦克柯里昂"
saying "fuck Michael Corleone"

328
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:28,420
这种杂碎我们怎么处置?
what do we do, with a piece of shit like that?

329
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:32,030
把他当狗东西 不是吗?
He's a fucking dog. No?

330
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:41,820
对! 说这种话的人
Yes it's true. If anyone would say such a thing,

331
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,530
肯定不是朋友
they would not be a friend.

332
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,700
就是个狗东西
They would be a dog.

333
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:54,070
我同札萨先生没有利害冲突
My interests don't conflict with Mr. Joe Zasa's

334
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,800
你只是还不知道
Oh you don't know how much

335
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,840
你跟他大有冲突
your interests conflict with Mr. Joe Zasa's, Uncle Michael.

336
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,450
文森
Vinnie

337
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,880
麦克 支持他
He needs your support, Michael.

338
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,180
别让我再做他手下了
Don't let me word for this guy no more Uncle Michael.

339
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,620
让我来帮你
let me come work for you.

340
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:05,720
- 替我做事? - 是的
- For me? - Yeah.

341
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,450
做什么? 当打手?
As what? Tough guy?

342
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,890
我用不着打手 律师倒多多益善
I don't need tough guys. I need more lawyers.

343
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,760
既然无怨无债
Since we have no conflicts, no debts

344
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:21,900
我接受馈赠并祝你如意
I accept your tribute. I wish you well.

345
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:26,770
文森 同札萨先生和好 来!
Vincent, Make your peace with Mr. Joe Zasa. C'mon

346
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,480
好 去啊
Okay. Go on.

347
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,890
小混蛋
Bastardo.

348
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,290
文森
Vincent

349
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,570
天啊! 快停下来 你疯了?
For Christ's sakes, stop! What's the matter with you?

350
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,400
把他弄走!
Get him out of here.

351
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,400
我的天!
Oh,Jesus.

352
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,440
麦克叔 我跟姑姑说过现在还不是时候
Uncle Michael, I told Connie it wasn't the right time for this.

353
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:57,970
关门
Close it.

354
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,340
我知道你现在转入金融证券界
I know you're into banks and Wall Street

355
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,740
但帮里事务仍由你作主
But everyone knows you're the final word, like the Supreme Court.

356
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,710
我要保护你 你的律师办不到
I want to protect you from these guys. Your lawyers can't do that.

357
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,320
- 你办得到? - 是 我办得到
- And you can? - Yeah, I can do that.

358
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,220
我何必怕札萨?
And why should I be afraid of Joe Zasa?

359
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,280
他知道你妨碍他
Well, he knows you're stopping him

360
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,520
在帮里往上爬
from rising up in the commission, Uncle Mike

361
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:17,890
要我说就杀了他 你下令我摆平
I say we make him dead. You give me the order, I'll take care of it.

362
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,470
- 你来摆平? - 是的
- You'll take care of it? - Yeah.

363
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:28,100
也许你应该跟随我几周
Maybe you should come with me for a few weeks

364
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,270
观察观察
See what happens.

365
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,370
好的
Okay.

366
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,110
看你学到多少
See if you learn

367
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:37,440
然后再商量你的前途
And, umm, we'll talk about your future.

368
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,450
我不会令你失望的
I won't let you down.

369

370
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,330

此事非一人能决定

556
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,860
不过麦克柯里昂野心勃勃

00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,430

565
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,020
存入梵蒂冈银行?

566
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:52,950
该银行为"屹立"的关系企业

567
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,390
确有此事 不行吗?
This is true. Why not?

568

存款时机
Wasn't there any questioning about

569

是否有蹊跷
the timing on this particular deposit

570
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:00,900
存款之事据说

571
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:02,700
主席 容我发言

利人利己

各位股东同仁

拨冗赴会谨此致谢

对不起 容我说句话
Listen, let me at this microphone here.

588
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:04,860
我们怎么能让这样一个罪犯掌管公司?
How can we let a criminal like thar run our company?

589
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:07,830
他一脸西西里匪相 你们看不到吗?
He's got the map of Sicily on his face. Can't you see it?

590
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,900
秩序! 秩序!

主席
Mr. Chairman

安东尼告诉我有关基金会的事
Tony says that I'm a front for the foundation

603
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:07,890
说你利用我来做门面
that you're using me just to pull the strings

604
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,590
获得自己想要的利益
to get the money where you want it.

605
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,390
请别这么说
Come on. Please.

606
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,730
提升个人形象
To shine up your public image

607

玛莉
Mary

608
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:18,230
这个基金是为了它现在的宗旨而建立的
this is real, this foundation

609
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,440
这是真的
It's real.

610
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:24,450
我之前想要安东尼加入
I wanted Anthony to be a part of it.

611
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:27,170
你们两个可以同心协力
I thought you two would be together on this.

612
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,180
我不会干涉你
I won't interfere.

613
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:30,780
除非你来向我求助
I'll help only if you ask.

614
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:34,480
但这些到底是为了什么?
But what is this really for?

615
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,480
你这么做是为了什么?
Why are you doing this?

616
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:38,920
而我又是为了什么?
Why am I doing this?

617
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:42,590
我这么做是为了我的孩子们
I'm doing this for my children.

618
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,230
你也是为你的孩子们
You're doing it for your children too.

619
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,500
但这基金会应该帮助所有人
This foundation is supposed to help all people.

620
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:50,930
当然 这是宗旨
Of course. That's the purpose.

621
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:53,770
这是合法的 玛莉
This is legitimate, Mary.

622
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:57,010
我保证这是合法的
I swear this is legitimate.

623
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:03,180
爸 我希望这件事令我们更加亲密
Dad, I want this to bring me closer to you.

624
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:13,330
我会不惜一切
I would burn in hell

625
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:16,130
保护你的安全
to keep you safe.

626
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:34,210
不要 你乘那辆 我跟麦克一道走
No, no. You go in the other car. I'll ride with Michael.

627
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:50,790
我与你家交情最深
As your family's oldest friend

628
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,660
一向由我给你通风报信
I'm always chosen to bring you messages.

629
00:47:56,270 --> 00:48:01,470
艾图贝洛阁下 请说!
Tell me, Don Altobello.

630
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:05,940
你以前给那些老伙计赚的钱 他们很感激
Your old partners are grateful for the money you made them.

631
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:08,180
可以说他们都崇拜你

632
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:15,250
但现在你抛弃了他们 这让他们很伤心
But their hearts are broken because they think you abandoned them.

633
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:19,920
"屹立"的生意 他们也要入股
They want to share your deal on Immobiliare

634
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,790
大家还是一家人
to be a family again.

635
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,330
也能帮他们洗钱
It can purify their money.

636
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,670
这件事我办不到
This I cannot do.

637
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:35,510
"屹立"必须是桩合法生意
Immobiliare must be legitimate.

638
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:42,310
我明白 可是他们不高兴
I know. But they're unhappy.

639
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:44,910
你呢?
And you?

640
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,880
我自己别无所求
I ask nothing for myself.

641
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:51,250
只盼着能怡养天年

642
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:56,330
可是我得抚慰身边的人
But I must please the world around me.

643
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,030
麦克 你爸通情达理
Michael, your father was a reasonable man.

644
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,600
学学他吧
Learn from him.

645
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:09,070
我从父亲那里学到许多
I learned many things from my father.

646
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,110
大家见个面吧 老伙计
Call a meeting, my friend

647
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:20,510
借此来解决我们的恩怨
so there are no debts or grudges.

648
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,320
我们会解决所有的问题
We will make the peace

649
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:24,650
你和我一起

650
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:40,370
罗马 梵蒂冈

651
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,400
今天梵蒂冈宣称

医生要求卧床静养

纽约各股东通过的动议

660
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,170
稍等
Please

661
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:53,140
本集团代表天主教友财团
our group represents a consortium of Catholic businessmen

662
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:56,840
反对柯氏掌权
against the Corleone control.

663
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:59,310
梵蒂冈已经投赞成票
The Vatican has cast its vote.

664
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,420
柯氏集团也已控制了董事会
The Corleone Group already controls the board.

665
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:04,320
但根据拉特兰之约
According to the Lateran Treaty

666
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:08,060
梵蒂冈投的票必须在罗马

667
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:09,990
由教皇亲自批准

教皇病重
The pope is gravely ill.

669
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:20,270
在他康复之前

670
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:22,700
我无能为力
I am powerless.

671
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:24,910
那万一他一病不起呢?
What if he dies?

672
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:28,140
那么套句美国俗话
Then as you Americans say

673
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:30,080
过往一切一笔勾消
All bets are off.

674

00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:38,130
这只是个短暂耽搁 仅此而已

679
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,970
我们早就说好了
We had an agreement

680
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:59,240
这场会议只是形式罢了 只是个形式
This meeting was to be merely a formality. That's all it was.

681
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:02,680
- 请坐下 - 我宁可站着 谁能回答我?
- Please sit down. - I'd rather stand. Could someone answer?

682
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:04,510
是我们把自己逼到了这里
We have put ourselves on the line

683
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:08,280
"屹立"在欧洲根深蒂固

685
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,350
我了解
I understand.

686
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,320
我了解你们的卑鄙手段
Your tactics are despicable.

687
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:17,790
这话从柯里昂先生口中说出来 可真是个不小的罪名
Well, that's quite an indictment, coming from a Corleone.

688
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,890
各位
Gentlemen

689
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:22,830
请别忘了你们现在是在梵蒂冈
Remember you're in the Vatican. Please.

690
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:28,270
你们到底 想要什么?
What is it that you want?

691
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,170
你可以取得控制权

696
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,030
这并不是针对你

仁科橄榄油

710
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:43,740
我们的祖父就是从这里开始的
That's where our grandfather got his start.

711
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:46,110
每周靠送货赚3美元

文森 你最近躲到哪儿去了?

716

要你帮忙的时候
You deserted us

717
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:56,990
扔下我们不管

718
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,460

他在我出生之前就死了

- 文森 - 什么?

751
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:24,080
他有没有杀自己的亲兄弟?
Did he kill his own brother?

752
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:30,660
没有
No.

753
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,860
所以那些传言都是谎话?

只是传言 知道吗?

I'd like to take Joey Zasa up for a ride in this and drop him.

761
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:24,670
札萨算什么
Joey Zasa is nothing.

762
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:27,070
不过是个微不足道的小跑腿
He's a small-time enforcer.

763
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,980
也就吹吹牛 吓唬吓唬人 没什么
He bluffs, threats, but nothing.

764
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:33,310
老远你就能知道他来了
You'll be able to see him coming a mile away.

765
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,750
- 我们应该趁早杀了他以免... - 不行!
- We should kill him before he kills... - No!

766
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:44,230
永远不要恨你的敌人 这会影响你的判断

We trusted you to manage our money in the casinos.

It's not even 20 years you sold the casinos

771
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,230

朋友们 我到这里来

775
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:08,080
是因为我们的共同事业已经结束了

776
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,040
我们都赚了大钱
We have prospered

777
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:12,180
现在是时候
and now it is time for us

778
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:16,050
解除我们之间的合作关系了
to dissolve the business relationship between us.

779
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,120
到此为止
That's it.

780
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:23,700
不过我有份小礼物
But I do have a little surprise

781

785
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:44,040
每个人都不一样 按当初...
Not everybody gets the same. It depends on how much...

786
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:47,010
- 没你的份儿 - 你资的额度及时间长短
- Nothing for you. - you invested and how long for.

787
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:50,280
麦克 你真大方!

791
00:58:58,740 --> 00:58:59,860
记不得了
I don't remember.

792
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:02,570
上帝会保佑你的 麦克

各位都认识乔札萨

我承认他是个大人物

798
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:30,720
时代周刊封面登过他的照片
His picture is on the cover of the New York Times Magazine.

He gets the Esquire magazine award for the best-dressed gangster.

他是个名人 天知道

803

00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:54,820
他会让在做各位都成为名人
he will make all of you popular.

805
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:56,720

我讲究穿着和仪容

这是我的天性

808
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:07,660
但我也想让自己的事业合法化

Sure, I take the blacks

811
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,070
甚至是南美籍人
and the Spanish into my family

812
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:20,240
因为这里是美国
because that's America.

813
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:25,350
你敢担保他们不在我们的地盘上贩毒?
And you guarantee that they don't deal drugs in those neighborhoods.

814
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,480
这个我不担保
I don't guarantee that.

815
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:31,560
我只担保谁贩毒我杀谁
I guarantee I'll kill anybody who does.

816
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:38,120

我让你们发财

824
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,540

今天他讲得很清楚
well he makes it, very clear to me today

829
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:11,200
摆明与我为敌
that he is my enemy.

830
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:16,090
你们必须在我们两个当中选一个
You must choose between us.

831
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:24,170
乔 不要这样 乔
Hey Joey, no, Joey, no, Joey

832
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:27,710
大家可以坐下来谈
We can reason together.

833
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:31,910
拜托 麦克
Michael, Michael

834
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,450
我们慢慢谈
let's agree, huh?

835
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:35,950
他根本不知道自己刚才
He doesn't know what he's

836
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,060
不行
No, no no.

837
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:46,090
麦克 到处都有消息说
Uh, Michael, Michael. The news is everywhere.

838
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:50,360
你已经控制了"屹立"
Everyone is saying that, you control Immobiliare.

839
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:54,100
"屹立"已经在秘鲁洗黑钱了
Immobiliare already is laundering money in Peru

840
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:56,600
还有拿骚 我们都知道
and Nassau. We know that.

841
01:01:56,610 --> 01:01:58,780
麦克 我们朋友也做了四十年了
Listen to me. We've been friends for 40 years.

842
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:01,110
我们也应该沾一点光
We should wet our beaks a little, huh?

843
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,810
我们想和你一起做生意
We want to do business with you.

844
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:09,180
- 好... - 用圣水洗净我们的钱...
- That's right... - We can wash our money clean in the holy water of...

845
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:20,390
暗杀 快走 跟我来 快走!
It's a hit. Let's go. Follow me. Let's get outta here!

846
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:40,080
- 我的外套! - 不要外套了
- My coat! - Forget your coat.

847
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:43,950
这是我的幸运外套! 幸运外套!
It's my lucky coat! It's my lucky coat!

848
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,460
跟在我后面!
Stay right behind me!

849
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:10,410
麦克 走这边!
Mikey, this way!

850
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:22,230
札萨 你这混帐东西!
Zasa you son of bitch!

851
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:44,080
走 我们赶紧离开
Come on, we're outta here.

852
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:19,350
- 你干得很好 - 谢谢
- You did good. - Grazier.

853
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:22,555
所有老头目几乎全死了
The old Dons were pretty much wiped out.

854
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:27,020
幸存下来的也都改投乔札萨了
The ones that survived made deals with Joey Zasa.

855
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,220
艾图贝洛呢?
Don Altobello?

856
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:29,620
他活下来了
He survived.

857
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:32,490
在他女儿斯达坦岛上的家里
He's with his daughters now in Staten Island.

858
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:35,600
他说要退隐 回西西里
Says he's gonna retire to Sicily.

859
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:42,000
没人撑腰 札萨决不会来这一手
Joey Zasa would never pull something like this without the backing.

860
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:45,170
他只会听人做事 其他什么都不会
He's just muscle. He's an enforcer. He's nothing.

861
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:47,610
用直升机行刺 他还想不出来这招
He doesn't have the wit for that helicopter attack.

862
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:52,150
他甚至都没那点野心和胆量敢消灭全帮
He doesn't even have the ambition to wipe out the whole commission.

863
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:56,360
我说我们要反击 也弄死他!
I say we hit back and take Zasa out!

864
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:03,350
决不能让别人知道你在想什么
Never let anyone know what you're thinking.

865
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:15,170
传话给乔札萨
Well, let's get a message to Joey Zasa.

866
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:20,310
对于他所做的事情 我很敬佩
I respect what he's done.

867
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:24,480
长江后浪推前浪 真很正常
The new overthrows the old. It's natural.

868
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:26,720
你怎么能跟这种家伙做生意?
How can you do business with this guy?

869
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,180
我现在首先是个生意人
I'm a businessman, first and foremost.

870
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:33,790
不想跟他再起冲突
I want no further conflict with him.

871
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,320
告诉他 我决定他的死活
You tell him from me that he can live or he can die.

872
01:05:36,330 --> 01:05:39,070
文森 住口!
Vincent, will you shut up!

873
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:58,450
好了
That's it.

874
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:05,220
乔札萨一个人干不出这种事
He can't be doing this alone.

875
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,860
我刚以为自己退出江湖了
Just when I thought I was out,

876
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:13,800
又被拖回去
they pull me back in.

877
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:28,880
真正的大敌还没有露面呢
Our true enemy has not yet shown his face.

878
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:35,780
麦克! 麦克!
Michael! Michael!

879
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:37,560
挺住!
No!

880
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,650
他有没有带药?
Has he taken his medicine?

881
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:42,450
我不知道他吃什么药
I don't know what he took.

882
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:51,300
- 我能喘气了 - 快叫医生
- I've got my wind back. - Call a doctor.

883
01:06:51,310 --> 01:06:53,270
- 快去 快去! - 文森!
- Run, run! - Vincent!

884
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:57,540
快奔向雷电 雷声伤不了任何人
Run at thunderbolt. Thunder can't hurt.

885
01:06:57,550 --> 01:06:59,910
声音伤不了任何东西
Harmless noise.

886
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,080
胡说八道
Bullshit.

887
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:05,540
他妈的老狐狸
You deceitful old fuck.

888
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:08,850
老艾 你个天杀的老狐狸!
Altobello, you fuck!

889
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,650
弗雷德!
Fredo!

890
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:15,460
弗雷德!
Fredo!

891
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:41,810
天啊爸
Oh, God. Dad.

892
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,430
我通知凯!
I'll call Kay.

893
01:07:57,810 --> 01:07:58,970
先生 晚上好
Good evening, sir.

894
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:00,770
能不能停一下? 我马上回来
Can we wait here? I'll be right back.

895
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:02,340
好的 先生!
Certainly, sir.

896
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:12,550
你说有紧急事故 哈里森先生
Mr. Harrison, you said it was urgent.

897
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:15,080
你来告解过吗?
Have you come to confess your sins?

898
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:17,450
柯里昂先生因糖尿病中风
Michael Corleone suffered a diabetic stroke.

899
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,890
我想见报之前应先通知你
I thought you should know that before you read it in the papers.

900
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,720
他现在昏迷不醒
He's in a coma on the critical list.

901
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:25,890
我来这里是为了确保我们的交易将不受任何影响
I'm here to insist the deal goes through in any event.

902
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:28,830
教皇的日子不多了
The pope has not much time left.

903
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:33,470
我跟你一样处境为难
So, as you, I am in a difficult position.

904
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:36,840
我们得尽早争取核准
We have to ratify this deal as soon as possible.

905
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:39,570
这一点我们有共识
We have an understanding.

906
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:41,350
很好
Good.

907
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:42,880
我现在要去医院
I'm going to the hospital.

908
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:44,910
我会为柯里昂先生祈祷
I'll pray for Mr. Corleone.

909
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,850
谢谢你
Thank you.

910
01:08:50,190 --> 01:08:51,950
我们都会为柯里昂先生祈福
Our thoughts are with Mr. Corleone.

911
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,730
谢谢你神父!
Thank you, Father.

912
01:08:56,630 --> 01:09:01,530
如柯里昂一死 内幕会揭开
Everything will be out in the open if Corleone dies.

913
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,460
祈求我们能有更多的时间吧 凯斯济
Pray for time, Keinszig.

914
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:10,680
这是从我对永恒的长久思考中养成的习惯
A habit born of, a long contemplation of eternity.

915
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:17,280
文森 算了
Just forget about it, Vinnie

916
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:19,710
为什么算了? 这很简单
Why forget about it? It's a simple hit.

917
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:24,280
我何尝不想干掉札萨
Look, I'd love to smack Joey Zasa then whack the fag, okay?

918
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:26,150
但不可能下手
But it's impossible.

919
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,050
他老在人群里
He's always mingling with people

920
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:29,560
还是在电视镜头前
in front of TV cameras

921
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:31,690
在自己的地盘上 我们不可能得手!
in his own neighborhood. It's impossible.

922
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:35,360
－不 我们办得到 －怎么做?
- It's not. It'll work for us. - How?

923
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:40,010
你以为他能让麦克叔活下去? 换了你会吗?
You think he's gonna let Uncle Michael survive this thing? Would you?

924
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:43,210
他也可能一病不起
He may not survive anyway.

925
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:45,040
你怎么下手?
How would you do it?

926
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:48,150
我会亲自动手
I'd do it. I'd do it myself.

927
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:51,150
你去办!
Do it!

928
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:56,290
- 你需要什么? - 派几个人给我
- What would you need? - See if you can get me a couple guys.

929
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,990
麦克
Hello, Michael.

930
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:33,620
是我 凯
It's Kay.

931
01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:44,960
凯 想不到你会来
Kay, I never expected you to come.

932
01:10:44,970 --> 01:10:48,140
我知道 知道
No, I know, I know.

933
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:53,310
- 但是我来了 - 我很高兴
- But I'm here. - I'm glad.

934
01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:58,380
你知道
You know

935
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:04,290
我从来没见过你那么脆弱
this is the first time I've seen you look so helpless.

936
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,030
这没那么严重 真的
It's not so bad, really.

937
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,930
我反而觉得
I feel

938
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:16,360
我现在更聪明了
I'm getting wiser now.

939
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:19,370
- 是吗? - 是!
- Yeah? - Oh, yeah.

940
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:22,480
病得越重越聪明 嗯?
The sicker you get, the wiser you get, huh?

941
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:26,180
我死的时候会聪明绝顶
When I'm dead, I'm gonna be really smart.

942
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,840
麦克
Michael

943
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:32,420
安东尼的事要谢谢你
I want to thank you for Tony.

944
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:38,650
他表现得很好 非常受瞩目
He's doing really well. He's gotten some very good notices

945
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:40,890
而且复活节要在巴勒摩
and he's going to be making his operatic debut in Sicily

946
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:44,220
首次登台
in Palermo, this Easter.

947
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,730
所以 谢谢你
So, thank you.

948
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:54,200
在西西里老家献艺 那真是无上光荣
That's a real honor. In Sicily.

949
01:11:56,910 --> 01:12:00,940
我会去的 不会错过
I will be there. I won't miss that.

950
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:03,480
决对不会
I won't miss that.

951
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:14,190
玛莉 安东尼 去看爸爸
Mary, Tony. Go see dad.

952
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:21,860
- 宝贝女儿 - 你会好起来的
- Oh, sweetheart. - Everything's going to be all right.

953
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:24,640
- 爸 - 安东尼
- Hey, dad. - Tony.

954
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,540

955
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,500
你妈告诉我了 你演出的事
Your mother told me. She told me what happened.

956
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:35,710
巴勒摩登台的事? 我真希望你能去
About Palermo? I really wanted you to be there.

957
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:39,040

Of course. Come here, kiss me.

958

Cousin Vinnie?

959
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:02,470
他不在 你打他的公寓电话
No, he isn't here. Why don't you call his apartment

960
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,140
给他留个电话录音吧
leave a message on his machine?

961
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:05,570
你堂妹玛莉
It's your cousin, Mary.

962
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:07,410
让她进来
Let her in.

963
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,580
谢了
Thanks.

964
01:13:11,590 --> 01:13:13,350
堂哥
Hey, cuz

965
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,780
顺便过来看看你 行吗?
I just thought I'd drop by. Is that okay?

966
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:17,820
我去叫弟兄
I'm gonna get the guys.

967
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:23,760
不好 你不应该来的
No, it's not okay. You shouldn't have come.

968
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:26,560
只能呆几分钟 知道吗?
A couple minutes only, okay?

969
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,600
- 你很漂亮 - 谢谢
- You look beautiful, cous. - Thanks.

970
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:37,400
这是你的俱乐部也是藏身之地?
So this is your club, your hideout?

971
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:38,800
是的
Yeah

972
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:40,910
我只是来看一下
I came here to check it out.

973
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:49,210
家里只有我和姑姑 感觉很奇怪
It's so strange, just me and Aunt Connie in the house.

974
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:52,350
跟你在一起就好多了
I feel better when I'm with you.

975
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:54,290
怎么回事?
What's wrong, sweetheart?

976
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,020
爸爸的事让我害怕极了
I'm really scared about my father.

977
01:13:56,030 --> 01:13:57,090
不要怕
Don't be scared.

978
01:13:57,100 --> 01:14:00,960
当我看到他被抬出救护车时 我以为他死了
When I saw them take him out of that ambulance, I thought he was dead.

979
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:03,790
我了解 但他会好起来
I know. Everybody says he's gonna be better.

980
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:07,800
不要担心了 嗯?
Don't worry, okay?

981
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:11,570
我还记得小时候家里被乱枪扫射
I remember them shooting at our house when I was little.

982
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:14,770
纳利带了些保镖来
And Al Neri came one time with other bodyguards

983
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:17,640
只带我和安东尼离开了
and just took me and Tony away.

984
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:21,250
是不是那种事又发生了?
Is it all happening again?

985
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:24,860
不是那样的
Not like that, sweetie.

986
01:14:25,930 --> 01:14:30,670
那你为什么躲在这里? 有什么事对你不利吗?
Then why are you hiding here? Is something going to happen to you?

987
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:34,300
我不会出事的
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

988
01:14:34,370 --> 01:14:37,140
我会照顾你
I'll take care of you.

989
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:48,970
我能跟你一起躲在这里吗?
Can I stay here and hide out with you?

990
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:51,480
那你要为弟兄们做饺子
You have to make gnocchi for the boys.

991
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:56,750
明知道我不会做菜 不过我可以帮忙
You know I don't know how to cook, but I'll help.

992
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:12,100
- 好 - 该怎么弄?
- Okay. - What do I do?

993
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:45,700
我爱你 堂哥
I love you, cuz

994
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:47,370
我也爱你 堂妹
I love you, too, cuz.

995
01:15:51,150 --> 01:15:53,140
接着做吧
Okay, let's cook.

996
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,430
抱我
Hold me.

997
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,040
像你们这样在新闻界的人
You know the people like you in the press,

998
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:52,460
或是警察都说什么黑手党 科萨·诺斯特拉
the police use words like Mafia, Cosa Nostra.

999
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:54,300
简直是笑话
This is a fantasy.

1000
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:55,490
我们意裔人都是些伟大的人物
The Italian-Americans are great people.

1001
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:59,140
我们辛苦建了这座城市 我们中有艺术家
We laid the bricks that built this city. We have the artists.

1002
01:16:59,150 --> 01:17:01,070
有发明电话的米乌奇
We have Meucci. He invented the telephone.

1003
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:02,700
还有饰演米乌奇的
We have Don Ameche who played the guy

1004
01:17:02,710 --> 01:17:04,580
阿密奇阁下
who invented the telephone. Huh?

1005
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:07,010
各位还是赶紧去买张抽奖券
So, listen, buy yourself a nice raffle ticket.

1006
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:09,260
说不定还能赢辆凯迪拉克
Maybe win yourself a Cadillac.

1007
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:12,990
这香肠真好吃
The salciccia is wonderful.

1008
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,590
吃个三明治吧 我们走
Here, have a sandwich. Let's go.

1009
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:31,040
- 札萨先生 你好 - 你好
- Nice to see you, Mr. Zasa. - Have a nice time.

1010
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:35,320
别忘了去买抽奖券 嗯?
Don't forget to buy your raffle tickets, huh?

1011
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,310
你干什么?
What are you doin'?

1012
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,580
真抱歉 快过来
He's sorry. Come here, son.

1013
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:44,620
好了 我们走
OK, OK, let's go.

1014
01:18:03,610 --> 01:18:06,870
乔 你好吗?
Joey how are you, pal?

1015
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,620
老弟 你好吗?
Hey, how are you, Buddy Boy!

1016
01:18:10,050 --> 01:18:14,120
乔札萨 去你的!
Hey, Joey Zasa! Joey! Up your ass!

1017
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,990
那是谁? 你认识?
Who is this? You know him?

1018
01:18:17,190 --> 01:18:18,380
别理他
Ignore him.

1019
01:18:18,390 --> 01:18:22,360
喂 乔 谁会赢这辆汽车? 你旁边的安特吗?
Hey,Joey, who's gonna win the car? The Ant?

1020
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:26,390
意裔美籍人的名声就是被这种人败坏的
This is the thing that gives the Italian-Americans a bad name, huh?

1021
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,030
这种阉鸡败类
A caponi like this, huh?

1022
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:30,960
去你的 乔!
Hey,Joey, up your ass!

1023
01:18:30,970 --> 01:18:34,170
你他妈给我从车上下来 你有抽奖券吗?
Get off of that fuckin' car. You got a raffle ticket?

1024
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:37,810
看看我的奖券 好好看看
Take a good look at my raffle ticket here.

1025
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,310
你的奖券不过这样而已
Here's what I think of you and your raffle ticket.

1026
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:51,120
快给我滚开 小瘪三 快滚
I told you, get the fuck outta here, get outta here.

1027
01:19:06,510 --> 01:19:08,900
还想跑 乔你这狗东西
Run,Joey, you piece of shit!

1028
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,920
开门 快开门!
Open the door! Open the door!

1029
01:19:23,930 --> 01:19:25,390
乔 你好吗?
Hi,Joe.

1030
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,630
札萨
Zasa.

1031
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:52,910
再也不准做这种事情
Don't ever again give that kind of order.

1032
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:54,950
只要我活着就不行
Not while I'm alive.

1033
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,780
懂吗?
Understand?

1034
01:19:58,130 --> 01:20:00,490
你当时的情况根本不能做决定
You were too sick to make a decision.

1035
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:05,120
纳利和康妮都同意我这么做
I got a go-ahead from Neri, I got a go-ahead from Connie.

1036
01:20:05,130 --> 01:20:06,900
康妮?
Connie?

1037
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:19,600
这个决定很正确 麦克叔
It was the right decision, Uncle Michael.

1038
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:21,710
这是错误的决定
It was the wrong decision.

1039
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:23,940
这个家我作主
I command this family.

1040
01:20:23,950 --> 01:20:26,910
不管是对的还是错的
Right or wrong

1041
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:30,350
这都不是我想要的
it was not what I wanted!

1042
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:50,570
明不明白?
Do you understand?

1043
01:20:57,350 --> 01:20:59,120
明白
Yes.

1044
01:21:04,830 --> 01:21:07,250
够了 麦克
Come on, Michael.

1045
01:21:18,210 --> 01:21:20,300
懂了!
Yes!

1046
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:25,840
好 文森 扶我回床上
Good. Vincent, help me to my bed.

1047
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:29,080
我要跟你谈一会
I wanna talk to you, alone, for a minute.

1048
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:37,520
你知道
You know

1049
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:42,690
对你 我总觉得有一分责任
I always felt responsible for you

1050
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:45,120
你知道 你父亲
You know, your father

1051
01:21:46,030 --> 01:21:49,900
我大哥 我们兄弟对立
my brother, we were opposites.

1052
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:51,930
我们总是吵架争辩
We would fight and argue

1053
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:55,070
但我没有怀疑过他对我的爱
but I never doubted his love.

1054
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:57,500
他愿意为我做任何事
He would do anything for me.

1055
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,240
但他的脾气
But his temper

1056
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:05,110
太急躁了
it was too much.

1057
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:07,690
这总让他失去理智
Clouded his reason.

1058
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,090
我不希望你也犯这种错误
I don't want you to make that mistak

1059
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:15,890
另外
Also

1060
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:19,970
他对女人也很有一套
he, too, had a way with women.

1061
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:26,900
- 文森 你跟我女儿是怎么回事? - 我也这么听说
- Vincent, what are you doing with my daughter? - So I hear.

1062
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:30,740
你跟她是怎么回事?
What are you doing with her?

1063
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:38,280
这太危险
It's too dangerous.

1064
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:42,450
知道吗?
You hear me?

1065
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:50,060
好
OK.

1066
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:05,840
文森
Vincenzo

1067
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:11,140
敌人动手时
When they come

1068
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:13,950
会向你所爱的人下手
they'll come at what you love.

1069
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:24,890
麦克 你应该换一种生活了
Michael, you must lead another life.

1070
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:27,730
人所能要求的你都拥有了
You have everything a man could desire.

1071
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:30,940
是时候该退休了
It's time for you to retire.

1072
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:34,810
我身上的责任太重
I have too much responsibility.

1073
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:37,640
- 为"屹立"? - 是的!
- Immobiliare? - Si.

1074
01:23:37,650 --> 01:23:41,170
如今太棘手 你真的应该抽身出来
Too difficult now. You should really get out.

1075
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:43,540
意大利那些权贵
What do you know

1076
01:23:43,550 --> 01:23:46,220
你知道多少?
about those pezzonovante in Italy?

1077
01:23:49,820 --> 01:23:53,750
我年纪已经大了 对那些年轻人的事不了解
I'm too old to know anything about those new people.

1078
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:58,620
我只能服老 回老家过清闲日子
I must accept my age and grow my olives and tomatoes.

1079
01:23:59,730 --> 01:24:01,890
我们还没那么老
We're not that old

1080
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:04,300
但你的病很重
But you're very ill.

1081
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,700
麦克
Michael

1082
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:09,530
让我知道我能做些什么
Let me see what can be done.

1083
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:13,680
让我帮你把路开得宽敞一点
Let me work to make your path a little easier.

1084
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:17,640
你的友谊一直很有助益
Your friendship does that always.

1085
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:19,740
那我就放心了
That makes me happy.

1086
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:24,820
乔札萨 你看错他了
Joe Zasa, You were wrong about him.

1087
01:24:25,090 --> 01:24:28,830
我的毛病就是太容易相信别人
I trust too much. That's always been my fault.

1088
01:24:36,370 --> 01:24:38,160
麦克
Michael

1089
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,570
到处都有背叛者
Treachery is everywhere.

1090
01:24:40,580 --> 01:24:45,540
你现在还有左右局势的能力
You still have your fingers on the strings, even now.

1091
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:48,680
我们要多见面
Let's see more of each other.

1092
01:24:49,180 --> 01:24:50,980
麦克
Michael

1093
01:24:50,990 --> 01:24:52,740
在西西里见?
In Sicily?

1094
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:54,450
在西西里
In Sicily.

1095
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:56,750
在西西里
In Sicilia.

1096
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:59,930
西西里
In Sicilia.

1097
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:12,810
西西里 巴格里亚

1098
01:25:46,310 --> 01:25:47,910
你好吗?
How are you?

1099
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:51,820
班甸奴阁下 我的老朋友
Don Bendino, my old friend.

1100
01:26:22,650 --> 01:26:24,440
我带你们来这里
I wanted to bring you here

1101
01:26:24,450 --> 01:26:26,210
好让我的老朋友及庇护人
so that my old friend and protector

1102
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:28,310
汤马西诺阁下
Don Tommasino

1103
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,350
给我们出主意
could advise us.

1104
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:34,820
汤马西诺阁下 你以为老艾如何?
Don Tommasino, what do you think about Altobello?

1105
01:26:36,730 --> 01:26:38,920
他是个聪明人
A very talented man.

1106
01:26:38,930 --> 01:26:40,590
维持了我们西西里人
He has kept the peace between our Sicilian

1107
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:43,860
与美国朋友之间的和平
and American friends.

1108
01:26:43,870 --> 01:26:46,540
讲道理的高手
The saint of reason.

1109
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:51,040
亚特兰大城里的那次血洗行动
The bloodbath in Atlantic City,

1110
01:26:51,050 --> 01:26:52,740
把纽约城搞得鸡飞狗跳
left New York a mess.

1111
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:56,140
本来札萨想控制这个艰难的时局
Now, Joey Zasa at least was running a very tight ship,

1112
01:26:56,150 --> 01:27:00,110
现在他死了 我们必须介入
but now that he's out of the picture, we're obligated to step in.

1113
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:01,880
又回去
Step back in.

1114
01:27:01,890 --> 01:27:03,050
我们不去 迟早华人
If we don't, the Chinese,

1115
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:04,970
或者哥伦比亚人会趁虚而入
the Colombians will.

1116
01:27:05,005 --> 01:27:06,880
柯里昂家族从不贩毒
The Corleone's left drugs,

1117
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:11,030
所以纽约弱 巴勒摩强
so New York is weak, and Palermo is strong

1118
01:27:11,370 --> 01:27:13,260
你丢下的地方
Your enemies always get strong

1119
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:15,590
敌人就能乘机坐大
on what you leave behind

1120
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:18,005
汤马西诺阁下
Don Tommasino

1121
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:23,500
谁可能指使那场屠杀
who could give the order for that massacre

1122
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:28,810
而且还能在梵蒂冈的交易上施压?
and still pressure the Vatican deal?

1123
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:30,740
只有鲁加西
Only Lucchesi

1124
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:34,540
能在黑白两道都吃得开
can reach between these two worlds.

1125
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:39,360
我们的船必须朝同一个方向航行
Our ships must all sail in the same direction

1126
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:43,790
几百年来意大利政界都有这种人
Italian politics have had these kind of men for centuries.

1127
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:46,660
他们 才是真正的黑手党
They're, the true Mafia

1128
01:27:46,670 --> 01:27:49,960
大主教和梵蒂冈银行的事是个大问题
The Archbishop and the Vatican bank, that's the big problem.

1129
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:51,760
是一样的
They're the same problem

1130
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:54,975
他们之间有勾结
B.J., they're connected.

1131
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:58,280
大主教有些权贵朋友
The Archbishop has very powerful friends.

1132
01:28:00,350 --> 01:28:02,370
他们会全力维护他
They totally protect him.

1133
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:07,210
教会方面 我们有谁能够投靠吗?
Is there someone in the church we can turn to?

1134
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:09,650
德高望重的人
Someone we can tell our problem to.

1135
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:14,380
红衣主教龙巴度
Cardinal Lamberto.

1136
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:17,790
为人和善睿智
A wise and good man

1137
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,720
极有影响力
very influential.

1138
01:28:19,730 --> 01:28:23,870
他会见你的
He will see you.

1139
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:30,600
好 我会去拜见龙巴度枢机
Bene. I will go see this Cardinal Lamberto

1140
01:28:30,610 --> 01:28:34,110
看看这件事能不能以文明的方式了解
and see if we can work things out in a civilized way

1141
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:38,040
就算你遵守协约
You honor your agreements

1142
01:28:38,050 --> 01:28:40,810
可是你要对付的那帮人全是些无赖
But these people you're dealing with are crooks

1143
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:43,250
他们是不会守信的
they have no honor.

1144
01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:47,420
一切由我作主
My word is final.

1145
01:28:57,370 --> 01:29:02,070
政治与犯罪本来就是一回事
Politics and crime. They're the same thing

1146
01:29:18,030 --> 01:29:21,890
好! 精彩!
Bravo! Bravo, Bravo!

1147
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:26,220
今天我邀请各位到此
I have invited you all here

1148
01:29:26,230 --> 01:29:31,130
是为了庆祝我的儿子首次登台演出
to celebrate, my son's first appearance in an opera house

1149
01:29:31,170 --> 01:29:35,330
他将于三周后
He will be appearing, in about three weeks

1150
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:39,070
在玛西摩剧院登台
in the Theatre Maximo

1151
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:41,470
演出"乡间骑士"
in the opera, Cavalleria Rusticana.

1152
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:44,340
爸爸 是乡间骑士
It's Cavalleria Rusticana dad.

1153
01:29:44,350 --> 01:29:47,980
骑士看来我买错歌剧票了
Cavalleria. I think I've got tickets to the wrong opera.

1154
01:29:48,290 --> 01:29:49,810
我在纽约待得太久了
I've been in New York too long.

1155
01:29:49,820 --> 01:29:53,480
大家都会收到门票
Anyway, you will all receive tickets.

1156
01:29:53,490 --> 01:29:55,150
多多捧场啊
So come on down.

1157
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:56,620
爸 我有一份礼物给你
Uh, dad, I've got a present for you

1158
01:30:01,170 --> 01:30:03,590
从柯里昂乡城流传而来
It comes from the town of Corleone and uh,

1159
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,740
是道地的西西里歌谣
it's authentic Sicilian

1160
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:11,010
我 是为你学的
And uh, I learned it for you

1161
01:31:39,670 --> 01:31:43,830
她又漂亮又善良 我爱她
She was, wonderful, beautiful. I loved her.

1162
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:45,700
然而她死了
And then she died.

1163
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:48,940
我的亲信保镖
My trusted bodyguard

1164
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:52,540
在我车上装炸弹
planted a bomb in my car

1165
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:55,210
她却在我之前驾驶那辆车
she drove it before I did.

1166
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:00,410
为什么在这么美丽的地方却充满了暴力?
Why is such a beautiful country, so violent?

1167
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:02,010
这是历史渊源
History.

1168
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:04,240
妈妈告诉我说她以前最担心的
You know, mom was telling me about the old days,

1169
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:06,650
就是怕考试不及格
when her biggest worry was just passing exams

1170
01:32:06,660 --> 01:32:08,650
没错
Yes it was, then.

1171
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:10,620
现在我为你担心
I worry about you now.

1172
01:32:10,630 --> 01:32:15,960
玛莉 你真是个心地善良的孩子 你总是这样
Oh Mary. Mary you're such a warm-hearted girl, you always were.

1173
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:17,830
我爱我的家人
I love my family.

1174
01:32:18,010 --> 01:32:20,000
甚至是你的堂兄文森?
Even your cousin Vincent?

1175
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:25,800
我是真心爱他
I really love him.

1176
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:28,770
他是你的近亲
He's your first cousin.

1177
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:30,980
那我更加爱他
Then I love him first.

1178
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:34,750
玛莉 你不能见他
Mary, you can't see him.

1179
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:37,720
不要再见他了
Just don't see him any more

1180
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:42,390
他说的对 太危险了
He's right. it's too dangerous

1181
01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:45,060
玛丽 听我说
Mary, listen to me.

1182
01:32:45,070 --> 01:32:48,430
你不能再见他了 不能以那种关系
You can't see him anymore. Not in that fashion.

1183
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:50,000
不要
No.

1184
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:54,500
- 答应我 - 不要
- Please promise me - No.

1185
01:32:54,510 --> 01:32:55,870
这件事你一定要答应!
Obey me on this Mary!

1186
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:57,770
不要 爸爸!
No, dad!

1187
01:33:02,150 --> 01:33:04,350
玛莉是个聪明的孩子
Mary's smart, dad

1188
01:33:04,750 --> 01:33:07,080
她会明白的
she'll understand eventually.

1189
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:33,270
美丽的堂妹 我的宝贝

1190
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:44,880
你要见我?
You wanted to see me?

1191
01:33:44,890 --> 01:33:46,560
是的
Yeah.

1192
01:33:46,830 --> 01:33:49,220
- 我要你去办件事 - 好的
- I want you to do something for me. - Okay.

1193
01:33:49,230 --> 01:33:50,890
这很危险
It's dangerous.

1194
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,990
好 我做 要我做什么?
Good. I'm in. What do you need?

1195
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,140
我要你投靠艾图贝洛
I want you to sell your soul to Don Altobello.

1196
01:33:59,710 --> 01:34:01,560
背叛我
To betray me.

1197
01:34:05,050 --> 01:34:06,810
他不可能相信我 这里
He'll never believe me. Here.

1198
01:34:08,010 --> 01:34:11,220
- 那要看情形 - 坐下
- That depends. - Sit down.

1199
01:34:13,550 --> 01:34:15,340
我有办法
I have an idea.

1200
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:21,090
你去探听老艾的关系攀到了多高
See if you can learn how high Altobello is connected.

1201
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:26,960
安排一次见面
Arrange a meeting.

1202
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:31,800
你说你对我忠心耿耿
You say how devoted you are to me.

1203
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:34,230
再告诉他你的问题
Tell him your problems.

1204
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:36,570
向他求助
You ask for his help.

1205
01:34:36,580 --> 01:34:38,340
什么问题?
What problems?

1206
01:34:39,180 --> 01:34:41,950
说你想和我女儿私奔
That you want to run away with my daughter.

1207
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:47,750
又怕这样会与我反目成仇
Only you know that if you do, I will become your enemy.

1208
01:34:51,630 --> 01:34:54,090
你知道我决不会这么做的 麦克叔
You know I'd never do that, Uncle Mike.

1209
01:34:54,130 --> 01:34:55,860
我知道
I know.

1210
01:34:56,400 --> 01:35:01,760
你求老艾来找我为你们说情
You ask Altobello to speak to me. To further the marriage.

1211
01:35:01,770 --> 01:35:03,930
你们毕竟是堂兄妹
You're cousins

1212
01:35:03,940 --> 01:35:07,460
麦克一向都保守
Michael was always a little old fashioned.

1213
01:35:07,470 --> 01:35:11,410
跟他说你不愿跟我做合法生意
Explain to him how, you can never be part of my, legitimate world.

1214
01:35:11,420 --> 01:35:13,540
要自立门户
That you want your own family.

1215
01:35:13,550 --> 01:35:15,780
我能接下札萨的摊子
straighten out with Joey Zasa

1216
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:22,150
如果你能够说服他
If you could use your friendship to persuade him

1217
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:25,120
我会永远记得你的恩情
I would be indebted to you forever.

1218
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:28,890
柯里昂家的人
A Corleone

1219
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:31,890
都非常重情谊
knows the value of such a friend.

1220
01:35:32,430 --> 01:35:35,460
那你肯为我做事?
So, then, you would work for me?

1221
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:42,660
是
Si.

1222
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:45,400
记住
Remember

1223
01:35:45,410 --> 01:35:49,540
假如他暗示要你背叛我
if he hints that he wants you to betray me

1224
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:51,070
你要装出收到侮辱的样子
get insulted.

1225
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:53,780
他只是试探你
Because that's his trap.

1226
01:35:59,990 --> 01:36:04,090
你没有告诉我所有实情 文森
You're not telling me the whole truth, Vincenzo.

1227
01:36:06,270 --> 01:36:13,530
只要麦克一死 一切不都是由那个女孩儿继承?
Isn't it true, with Michael gone, the girl controls everything?

1228
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:18,640
你别扯上那女孩
You leave the girl out of this.

1229
01:36:18,650 --> 01:36:22,610
当然 你爱她 她也爱你
Of course, you love her. And she loves you.

1230
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:46,600
我猜中了吧 文森
I guessed it Vincenzo, huh?

1231
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:50,230
你是位智者 艾图贝洛阁下
You're a wise man, Don Altobello.

1232
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:53,040
有好多事我要跟你学习
I'm going to be learning a lot from you.

1233
01:36:53,050 --> 01:36:57,650
最富有的人是拥有最多权贵朋友的人
The richest man is the one with the most powerful friends.

1234
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:03,150
我有责任为你介绍
It's my duty to make the introductions.

1235
01:37:08,530 --> 01:37:10,590
鲁加西阁下
Don Lucchesi

1236
01:37:13,270 --> 01:37:17,760
老艾说你是个坚强的人
Don Altobello tells me you have good character, strong

1237
01:37:17,770 --> 01:37:19,200
是个值得人尊重的人
a man of respect.

1238
01:37:19,210 --> 01:37:23,030
这就是令札萨长眠的英雄
This is the hero who put Joey Zasa in his grave.

1239
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:24,770
早认识他
If we'd known of his existence

1240
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:27,500
我们就不会支持札萨了
we would never have backed Joey.

1241
01:37:27,510 --> 01:37:30,040
没有人会愿意的
No one wants another Joe

1242
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:34,340
我们交个朋友吧
Let me be your friend.

1243
01:37:34,350 --> 01:37:37,380
最坚强的人也要交朋友
Even the strongest man needs friends.

1244
01:37:37,390 --> 01:37:39,160
这太荣幸了
I'm flattered.

1245
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:42,890
但鲁西尼阁下你是金融政治人物
But you're a man of finance and politics, Don Lucchesi

1246

那些事我都不懂
these are things I don't understand.

1247
01:37:46,130 --> 01:37:48,490
你知道怎么用枪吗?
You understand guns?

1248
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:50,960
金融就是一把枪
Finance is a gun.

1249
01:37:50,970 --> 01:37:53,060
政治
Politics

就是知道适时扣扳机

1251
01:37:59,810 --> 01:38:01,710
我要做些什么?
How can I help?

1252
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:09,350
追求和平的人总是受到赐福
Blessed is the peacemaker

1253
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:12,480
因为他可以被称为是神的儿子

1254
01:38:12,490 --> 01:38:17,090
- 懂说一点意大利语吗? - 懂
- Can you speak Italian well? - Yes.

1255
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:40,550
汤马西诺阁下的轮椅
The wheelchair, for Don Tommasino.

1256
01:38:48,430 --> 01:38:52,090
这笔交易我托给了大主教
I trusted this business arrangement with the archbishop.

1257
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:57,330
我那么相信他 相信他的诚实
I trusted him. I was sure his honesty was beyond a doubt.

1258
01:38:57,340 --> 01:39:02,670
但现在 我完全被骗了
But, as you see, I'm now the victim of a swindle.

1259
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:04,630
他一直在拖延着我
He's stalling me.

1260
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:08,740
巨额的钱财都到了政界高层手里
Vast money have gone to the pezzonovante in high political places

1261
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:11,710
而梵蒂冈银行为其做担保人
and the Vatican Bank is the guarantor.

1262
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:14,380
如过你说的话属实
If uh, what you say is true

1263
01:39:14,390 --> 01:39:17,820
这将是个大丑闻
there will be a great scandal.

1264
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:20,750
你看这块石头
Look at this stone.

1265
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:24,150
它泡在水里已经很久了
It has been lying in the water for a very long time

1266
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:29,030
水却仍然没有能够浸透它
but the water has not penetrated it.

1267
01:39:31,870 --> 01:39:33,540
你看
Look.

1268
01:39:34,270 --> 01:39:36,700
还是干的
Perfectly dry.

1269
01:39:37,110 --> 01:39:39,740
欧洲人也是这样
The same thing has happened to men in Europe.

1270
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:44,640
多少个世纪以来 他们一直受基督教教诲
For centuries they have been surrounded by Christianity

1271
01:39:44,650 --> 01:39:47,440
但基督却仍然没能进入他们的心里
but Christ has not penetrated.

1272
01:39:47,450 --> 01:39:52,020
不能与他们在生活中相伴
Christ doesn't breathe within them.

1273
01:39:54,390 --> 01:39:55,520
这是怎么回事?
What's happened?

1274
01:39:55,530 --> 01:39:59,920
能不能 给我点甜的东西?
Is it possible, that you could get me something sweet?

1275
01:39:59,930 --> 01:40:03,100
柳橙汁 随便什么 糖果
Orange juice, anything, candy.

1276
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:09,240
我有糖尿病
Trouble with diabetes.

1277
01:40:12,050 --> 01:40:14,640
血糖一定要保持低水平
Blood sugar levels must be low.

1278
01:40:14,650 --> 01:40:17,210
我了解
I understand.

1279
01:40:39,340 --> 01:40:42,570
压力一大 有时候就这样
When I'm under stress sometimes this happens.

1280
01:40:43,210 --> 01:40:45,200
我了解
I understand.

1281
01:40:46,810 --> 01:40:49,010
来见你
I come to you

1282
01:40:49,180 --> 01:40:52,110
说这种敏感的事
on such a delicate matter

1283
01:40:53,490 --> 01:40:56,910
指控大主教
accusations against your Archbishop

1284
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:59,750
对我而言太难受
was difficult for me.

1285
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:02,020
精神收到折磨
The mind suffers

1286
01:41:02,030 --> 01:41:06,030
身体自然不好
and the body, cries out.

1287
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:13,560
的确如此
That's true.

1288
01:41:14,210 --> 01:41:19,210
你要不要做告解?
Would you like, to make your confession?

1289
01:41:25,050 --> 01:41:27,250
阁下
Your Eminence

1290
01:41:27,550 --> 01:41:33,320
我 我 很久没有做告解了
I'm uh, I'm uh, it's been so long,

1291
01:41:33,330 --> 01:41:37,820
我不 不 不知道从哪里...
I wouldn't, wouldn't, wouldn't know where to uh...

1292
01:41:37,830 --> 01:41:41,100
都有三十年了
it's been thirty years

1293
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:45,300
我也许会耽误你很久
I'd, I'd, I'd use up too much of your time, I think.

1294
01:41:45,310 --> 01:41:49,270
拯救灵魂 我总是有时间的
I always have time to save souls.

1295
01:41:50,810 --> 01:41:53,600
我想 我已经罪无可赦
Well, I'm, I'm beyond redemption.

1296
01:42:03,490 --> 01:42:08,420
这里的教士也会向我告解
I hear the confessions of my own priests here.

1297
01:42:08,430 --> 01:42:12,760
有时候告解的心情已到极致
Sometimes the desire to confess is overwhelming

1298
01:42:12,770 --> 01:42:15,860
我们就要把握时机
and we must seize the moment.

1299
01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:22,170
假如我没有悔意
What is the point of confessing

1300
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:26,000
告解有什么用?
if I don't repent?

1301
01:42:26,010 --> 01:42:29,470
我听说你精打细算
I hear you are a practical man

1302
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:32,950
你认为告解会有什么损失吗?
What have you got to lose, huh?

1303
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:45,220
说吧
Go on.

1304
01:42:51,540 --> 01:42:53,960
我
I

1305
01:42:54,110 --> 01:42:56,600
对妻子不忠
betrayed my wife.

1306
01:42:57,710 --> 01:43:00,070
说下去 孩子
Go on, my son.

1307
01:43:04,950 --> 01:43:07,190
背叛了自己的心
I betrayed myself.

1308
01:43:09,660 --> 01:43:11,750
我曾经杀过人
I killed men.

1309
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:18,190
也曾令手下去杀人
And I ordered men to be killed.

1310
01:43:19,270 --> 01:43:22,860
接着说 孩子 接着说
Go on, my son, go on

1311
01:43:26,670 --> 01:43:29,410
这根本没用
It's useless.

1312
01:43:30,780 --> 01:43:33,340
说吧 孩子
Go on, my son.

我杀了
I killed

1314
01:43:40,350 --> 01:43:43,880
我让人杀了我的兄弟
I ordered the death of my brother.

1315
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:46,950
他伤害了我

1316
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:51,160
我杀了我母亲的儿子
I killed my mother's son.

1317
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:55,400
我杀了自己的同胞兄弟
I killed my mother's son.

1318
01:44:04,110 --> 01:44:06,470
你的确罪大恶极
Your sins are terrible

1319
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:10,270
因此你身心遭受苦痛
and it is just that you suffer

1320
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:13,810
你的人生仍可获得救赎
Your life could be redeemed

1321
01:44:13,820 --> 01:44:16,110
但我知道你不相信
but I know that you don't believe that.

1322
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:18,450
你也不会有所改变
You will not change.

1323
01:44:41,550 --> 01:44:44,870
教皇保禄六世

1329
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:18,510
我这一辈子都在力争上游
all my life I, kept trying to go up in society

1330
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:22,750
希望成为一个干净清白的人
where everything higher up was legal, straight.

1331
01:45:23,260 --> 01:45:27,820
但是我爬得越高 世界就越险恶
But the higher I go, the crookeder it becomes.

1332
01:45:29,530 --> 01:45:31,990
这些事什么时候才能结束?
How in the hell does it end?

1333
01:45:40,870 --> 01:45:44,370
千百年来人类相互残杀

为钱

为名 为家族

为了免于沦为富贵者的奴隶

为什么 麦克? 这可不像你的作风

1340
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:17,130
何必向一个陌生人坦白罪行
You don't have to confess your sins to a stranger.

1341
01:46:17,140 --> 01:46:19,210
这个人不一样

你知道
you know

1347

有时候我会想起弗雷多
sometimes I think of poor Fredo

1348
01:46:39,770 --> 01:46:42,230
淹死在湖里
drowned.

1349
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:44,260

套句美国话
You are my 'ace in the hole'

1362
01:48:30,980 --> 01:48:34,470
你是我盖着的王牌
as we say in America.

1363
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:37,970
我有个麻烦
I have a stone in my shoe.

1364
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:41,520
你能帮我除掉

1365
01:48:47,730 --> 01:48:50,390
只有一个麻烦?
Only one stone?

他很想来
No, no, I know. He wanted to come very much,

1385
01:50:12,260 --> 01:50:14,340
可是有重要的官司
but he had a very important trial.

1386

1440
01:55:27,730 --> 01:55:30,890
父亲 我的父亲!

她父亲举起宝剑

1447
01:55:59,690 --> 01:56:01,480
为了家庭的名声吗

我还记得当年你去见我父母
You know, I remember the time that you came to my parent's house.

说你决不会沾手

那口气就像安东尼
You sounded like Tony

1453
01:56:33,660 --> 01:56:35,930
当年的我的确很像
I was a lot like Tony.

1454
01:56:44,570 --> 01:56:46,060
- 这里 凯 - 什么?

1456
01:56:47,370 --> 01:56:48,830
出什么事了吗?

看来今天没有随身保镖跟着啊

1461
01:57:04,190 --> 01:57:06,010
我可是真的偷跑出来的

1462
01:57:12,900 --> 01:57:20,330
神父 上哪儿去? 要搭便车吗?
Father, where are you going? Would you like a ride?"

1463

以前的保镖

我以前在这里度过了很长时间

然后你结婚了
And then you got married.

1477
01:58:32,910 --> 01:58:34,640
但我依然想念你
I still thought of you.

1478
01:58:35,310 --> 01:58:37,140
那间房里有什么?
What's in that room?

1479
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:43,510
麦克 你知道来这里很危险
You know this is dangerous for you, Michael.

1480
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:45,450
这儿是西西里
This is Sicily.

1481
01:58:47,590 --> 01:58:49,120
我爱这里

1482
01:58:49,130 --> 01:58:50,890
为什么?
Why?

1483
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:56,190
世代以来
Well, all through history

1484
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:59,460
这里的人受尽折磨
terrible things have happened to these people.

1485
01:58:59,470 --> 01:59:02,430
各种不公正的事
Terrible injustice.

1486
01:59:02,770 --> 01:59:05,870
但是他们依旧期待
But they still expect good

1487
01:59:05,880 --> 01:59:08,170
会有好的事情发生
rather than bad will happen to them.

1488
01:59:08,180 --> 01:59:10,540
就像我和你
Sort of like me and you, huh?

1489
01:59:14,250 --> 01:59:15,340
哪里?
How so?

1490
01:59:15,350 --> 01:59:17,280
我现在在这里啊
Well I'm still here, right?

1491
01:59:17,820 --> 01:59:20,120
我们的过去也不很愉快

1492
01:59:20,130 --> 01:59:21,350
但我还在这里

1493
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:24,490
是的 你还在 但是心里只有恐惧
Oh yes you are. But with dread.

1494
01:59:28,630 --> 01:59:30,960
说出你的心意!
Gimme the order! C'mon!

1495
01:59:30,970 --> 01:59:34,360
为什么要这么做? 让我不怕你?
What's that supposed to do, is that supposed to make me not dread you?

1496
01:59:36,440 --> 01:59:38,970
我们来这里是为了看歌剧
We're in Sicily, the opera.

1497
01:59:41,180 --> 01:59:42,640
好吧
Okay

1498
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:47,320
现在干什么?
what do we do now?

1499
01:59:49,790 --> 01:59:51,720
讲道理
Be reasonable.

1500
01:59:52,360 --> 01:59:54,450
我希望我们不要再伤害彼此
Let's try not to hurt each other.

1501
02:00:01,330 --> 02:00:03,660
我希望你能原谅我
I want you to forgive me.

1502
02:00:06,240 --> 02:00:08,100
原谅你什么?
For what?

1503
02:00:08,510 --> 02:00:10,400
所有事情
Everything.

1504
02:00:13,050 --> 02:00:16,640
像上帝那样?
Oh, like God, huh?

1505
02:00:16,850 --> 02:00:20,610
不用那么夸张
Oh, I, I need something a little closer.

1506
02:00:22,420 --> 02:00:26,890
你当时不了解我的处境
You couldn't understand, back in those days.

1507
02:00:27,090 --> 02:00:29,220
我爱我的父亲
I love my father

1508
02:00:29,230 --> 02:00:32,190
我曾经发誓不会成为他那样的人
I swore I would never be, a man like him

1509
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:34,990
但是我爱他 而他又身处险境
but I loved him. And he was in danger

1510
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:36,590
我能怎么办?
what could I do?

1511
02:00:36,600 --> 02:00:40,160
然后 你也身处险境
And then later, you were in danger.

1512
02:00:40,170 --> 02:00:44,140
孩子也一样 我能怎么办?
Our children, were in danger. what could I do?

1513
02:00:44,540 --> 02:00:51,580
你们是我在这个世界上最重要的人
You were all that I loved, valued, most in the world.

1514
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:55,580

And, I'm losing you, I lost you, anyway.

1515
02:00:55,590 --> 02:00:57,750
你离开了我
You're gone.

1516
02:00:58,590 --> 02:01:00,920
我失去了一切
and it was all for nothing

1517
02:01:00,930 --> 02:01:03,130

you have to understand, I had a whole different destiny planned.

1519
02:01:14,770 --> 02:01:16,770
好吧 我不说了
All right, I'll stop.

1520
02:01:27,220 --> 02:01:29,210
麦克 我不知道你到底要我怎么做
I really don't konw what you want from me,Michael.

1521
02:01:29,220 --> 02:01:31,420
我真的不知道
I really don't know.

1522
02:01:31,590 --> 02:01:33,380
我是说
I mean

1523
02:01:33,390 --> 02:01:37,150
我并不是你想像的那种人
I'm not the man that you think I am.

02:01:42,870 --> 02:01:46,540
不要再害怕我
Don't dread me, anymore.

1527
02:01:50,740 --> 02:01:56,710
其实 在这里的每个晚上
You know, every night here in Sicily

1528
02:01:56,720 --> 02:01:59,010
我作梦
I dream

1529
02:01:59,790 --> 02:02:03,150
梦见我的妻子和孩子
about my wife and my children.

1530
02:02:05,320 --> 02:02:08,490
梦见我如何失去他们
And how I lost them.

1531
02:02:09,430 --> 02:02:16,460
如果这对你是种安慰我想告诉你
I guess, if it's any consolation, I want you to know that

1532
02:02:18,670 --> 02:02:24,170
麦克 过去我一直爱你
I always loved you, Michael.

1533
02:02:24,940 --> 02:02:32,620
以后是一样
I always, I always will.

1534
02:02:59,110 --> 02:03:00,810
出什么事了?
What is it? What's wrong?

1535
02:03:02,050 --> 02:03:06,410
汤马西诺阁下被人枪杀了
They found Don Tommasino shot.

1536
02:03:06,420 --> 02:03:08,150
他死了?
Is he dead?

1537
02:03:10,220 --> 02:03:14,250
我家主人死了 血债血偿
My master is dead. Blood calls for blood.

1538
02:03:14,260 --> 02:03:18,930
我一定要报仇
I must have revenge

1539
02:03:20,570 --> 02:03:26,490
将来也许有难事要你去办
Some day, you may have to do a difficult service for me.

1540
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:30,210
尽管吩咐
Command me.

1541
02:03:31,140 --> 02:03:34,430
我会为他报仇
I will avenge him

1542
02:03:48,430 --> 02:03:50,350

Do you accept your election

1547
02:04:11,220 --> 02:04:13,680
担任教皇圣职?
as supreme pontiff?

1548
02:04:13,690 --> 02:04:19,950
上帝明鉴 赐福吾同僚之决策
My God, shed light on the decision they have taken on my behalf

1549
02:04:20,060 --> 02:04:22,050
我接受

1550
02:04:22,060 --> 02:04:24,690
你希望被如何称呼?
By what name do you wish to be called?

1551
02:04:24,700 --> 02:04:28,400
若望保禄一世
John Paul the First.

1552
02:04:57,860 --> 02:05:00,060
我将即刻执行此事
I will do things 'right away'

1553
02:05:00,070 --> 02:05:04,290
而不再考量拖延
rather than in 'a little while.'

1554
02:05:04,300 --> 02:05:07,870
梵蒂冈会计师凯斯济
Frederik Keinszig, known for a decade as "God's banker,"

1555
02:05:07,880 --> 02:05:11,730
已失踪三天 最后被见于

1556
02:05:11,740 --> 02:05:14,350
梵蒂冈辖下
leaving the Rome offices of the Vatican owned

1557
02:05:14,360 --> 02:05:17,170
"屹立"的罗马办公室内

02:05:17,180 --> 02:05:21,040
随之失踪的还有大笔款项 及多份文件
Also missing was a large sum of money, and several documents.

1559
02:05:21,050 --> 02:05:25,950
凯斯济快接电话啊白痴
Come on, Keinszig, you fool.

1560
02:05:27,660 --> 02:05:29,720
凯斯济的失踪
Mr. Keinszig's absence

1561
02:05:29,730 --> 02:05:32,720
使得梵蒂冈银行的交易越显蹊跷
casts further suspicion on the dealings of the Vatican bank.

1562
02:05:32,730 --> 02:05:35,690
多年以来该行及其下属子公司
For several years the bank and its subsidiary companies

1563
02:05:35,700 --> 02:05:37,450

1564
02:05:37,460 --> 02:05:41,400
进行非法交易
disreputable business practices.

1565
02:05:41,410 --> 02:05:46,040
鲁加西 请你尽量要了解
Lucchesi, will you please try and understand.

1566
02:05:46,780 --> 02:05:48,640
我打电话找过他

1567
02:05:48,650 --> 02:05:51,210
也一直在等他的电话
I have waited here by the phone.

1568
02:05:54,050 --> 02:05:58,110
你一定要记住鲁西尼
You would do well to remember, Mr. Lucchesi

1569
02:05:58,120 --> 02:06:00,680
当今教皇的想法
that this Pope

1570
02:06:00,690 --> 02:06:05,860
与其上任大为不同
has very, different ideas from the last one.

1571
02:06:26,990 --> 02:06:29,550
再见 老朋友
Goodbye my old friend.

1572
02:06:31,560 --> 02:06:34,150
你本可以多活几年
You could have lived a little longer

1573
02:06:35,190 --> 02:06:38,660
我也可以更接近我的理想

1574
02:06:43,940 --> 02:06:47,070
汤马西诺阁下 你深受爱戴
You were so loved, Don Tommasino.

1575
02:06:51,510 --> 02:06:54,000
为什么我招人畏惧
Why was I so feared

1576
02:06:54,010 --> 02:06:56,300
你却受人爱戴?
and you so loved?

1577
02:06:56,510 --> 02:06:58,580
是什么原因?
What was it?

1578
02:06:59,150 --> 02:07:01,880
我也做过不少好事
I was no less honorable.

1579
02:07:03,530 --> 02:07:06,390
我也想做好人
I wanted to do good.

1580
02:07:09,670 --> 02:07:10,970
到底是什么背弃了我?
What betrayed me?

1581
02:07:10,980 --> 02:07:14,040
我的想法? 还是我的心?
My mind? My heart?

1582
02:07:15,580 --> 02:07:18,970
为什么我要逼迫我自己呢?
Why do I condemn myself so?

1583
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:26,910
我发誓
I swear

1584
02:07:26,920 --> 02:07:30,190
以我子女的性命发誓
on the lives of my children

1585
02:07:33,670 --> 02:07:37,960
给我赎罪的机会
Give me a chance to redeem myself

1586
02:07:40,340 --> 02:07:45,080
我再也不会犯下罪行
and I will sin, no more.

1587
02:08:08,070 --> 02:08:11,030
你脸色不好 有坏消息
You look pale. Bad news.

1588
02:08:11,040 --> 02:08:12,800
告诉我
Tell me right away

1589
02:08:14,010 --> 02:08:16,710
现在不仅是银行舞弊
It's not just a bad banking deal.

1590
02:08:17,740 --> 02:08:20,010
这些人就是屠夫
These guys are butchers.

1591
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:22,840
哪些人?
What guys?

1592
02:08:22,850 --> 02:08:24,740
鲁加西
Lucchesi.

1593
02:08:25,380 --> 02:08:26,910
他控制了所有人
He controls all of them

1594
02:08:26,920 --> 02:08:28,610
包括老艾
Altobello,

1595
02:08:28,620 --> 02:08:30,750
大主教
the Archbishop

1596
02:08:31,160 --> 02:08:34,150
还有其他更高的人
other people higher up, P2, maybe

1597
02:08:34,160 --> 02:08:36,180
还有秘密不知道
Secret, unknown.

1598
02:08:36,190 --> 02:08:38,330
他们正在做什么事情
They're running things.

1599
02:08:40,770 --> 02:08:42,430
我是他们的障碍
I'm in their way.

1600
02:08:43,570 --> 02:08:46,190
他雇了职业杀手要杀你
He's hired a professional assassin to kill you.

1601
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:47,800
是西西里人
He's Sicilian.

1602
02:08:47,810 --> 02:08:49,800
不知道名字
I don't know his name,

1603
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:53,140
据说他从没有失手过
but they say he never fails.

1604
02:08:54,350 --> 02:08:56,610
我们都很危险
Then no one is safe.

1605
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:02,550
新教皇的处境也很危险
Even the new pope is in danger.

1606
02:09:02,990 --> 02:09:07,350
我们还来得及阻止
We still have time. We can prevent this.

1607
02:09:11,200 --> 02:09:13,090
我尽力了
I tried

1608
02:09:15,630 --> 02:09:17,900
我已经尽力
I tried

1609
02:09:18,700 --> 02:09:21,840
想避免走到这田地
to keep everything from coming to this.

1610
02:09:21,875 --> 02:09:24,570
但是躲不开
But it's not possible,

1611
02:09:24,580 --> 02:09:27,780
在世上躲不开
not in this world.

1612
02:09:27,880 --> 02:09:30,310
下命令吧
Give me the order.

1613
02:09:33,380 --> 02:09:35,680
那你就没有回头路了
You won't be able to go back.

1614
02:09:36,750 --> 02:09:38,410
你会步我的后尘
You'll be like me.

1615
02:09:38,420 --> 02:09:40,190
好啊
Good.

1616
02:09:40,690 --> 02:09:43,550
我一辈子都想脱离江湖
All my life I wanted out.

1617
02:09:43,560 --> 02:09:47,020
希望我的家庭远离是非
I wanted the family out.

1618
02:09:47,670 --> 02:09:50,120
我不想
Well, I don't want out.

1619
02:09:50,130 --> 02:09:52,990
我渴望拥有保护这个家族声誉的权利
I want the power to preserve the family.

1620
02:09:57,480 --> 02:10:00,300
下命令吧
I'm asking for the order.

1621
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:22,490
行了
It's done.

1622
02:10:23,900 --> 02:10:26,830
我干不下去了
Because I can't do it anymore.

1623
02:10:31,010 --> 02:10:32,470
没关系
Well, it doesn't matter.

1624
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:35,870
文森会处理的 出去吧
Vincent knows what to do. Come on outside.

1625
02:10:35,880 --> 02:10:39,510
歇会儿 不要再想了
Take a rest and don't think about it.

1626
02:10:39,520 --> 02:10:41,110
我能做的就是一直思考
All I do is think about it.

1627
02:10:41,120 --> 02:10:43,110
我就是你的儿子
I'm your son.

1628
02:10:43,590 --> 02:10:46,150
一切交给我
Command me in all things.

1629
02:10:47,960 --> 02:10:50,590
放弃我女儿
Give up my daughter.

1630
02:10:52,900 --> 02:10:55,260
这是你要付的代价
That's the price you pay

1631
02:10:56,170 --> 02:10:58,700
为你选择的人生
for the life you choose.

1632
02:11:24,730 --> 02:11:26,430
侄子
Nephew

1633
02:11:28,430 --> 02:11:30,930
从今以后
from this moment on

1634
02:11:32,170 --> 02:11:34,990
你就是文森柯里昂

1636
02:11:56,060 --> 02:11:57,990

02:12:08,610 --> 02:12:11,530
文森柯里昂阁下!
Don Vincenzo Corleone.

1640
02:12:59,720 --> 02:13:01,080
玛莉
Mary.

1641
02:13:24,150 --> 02:13:26,750
"乡间骑士"歌剧

1642
02:13:44,500 --> 02:13:47,030
文森
Et Tu, Vincenzo

1643
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:50,000
你对麦克的感情我了解
I know how you feel about Michael

1644
02:13:50,010 --> 02:13:52,470
但你救不了他
but you, you can't save him.

1645
02:13:52,480 --> 02:13:54,610
他失败了
He's lost.

1646
02:13:55,450 --> 02:13:57,980
为自己打算吧
Think of yourself.

1647
02:13:58,420 --> 02:14:01,280
你的答案是什么?
What's your answer, Vincent?

1648
02:14:02,890 --> 02:14:05,380
欣赏歌剧
Enjoy the opera.

1649
02:14:06,720 --> 02:14:08,920
一切都安排妥当
It's all taken care of.

1650
02:14:14,130 --> 02:14:16,900
察看一下酒吧 我去检查屋顶
Check the bar. I'll check the top floor.

1651
02:14:20,710 --> 02:14:23,830
但愿安东尼在台上演唱
Here's hoping Tony sings better at Theatre Maximo

1652
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:25,540
胜过他在洗澡时的歌声
than he does in the shower.

1653
02:14:27,580 --> 02:14:30,140
亲爱的康妮
My darling, Constanzia.

1654
02:14:30,210 --> 02:14:32,010
艾图贝洛阁下
Oh, Don Altobello.

1655
02:14:32,020 --> 02:14:33,770
这真是件大事

1656
02:14:33,780 --> 02:14:35,640
来 坐

1657
02:14:39,560 --> 02:14:41,620
生日快乐
Happy birthday.

1658
02:14:41,830 --> 02:14:44,390
八十岁的人看来像六十
You're eighty years old.You don't look more than sixty.

1659
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:46,650
我的生日只有你记得
You're the only one who remembered.

1660
02:14:46,660 --> 02:14:48,430
刚得到的消息
Michael, we just got the word.

1661
02:14:48,440 --> 02:14:50,360
"屹立"的交易教皇签署了
The Pope's ratified the Immobiliare deal.

1662
02:14:50,370 --> 02:14:51,830
我们赢了
We've won.

1663
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:53,730
恭喜
Congratulations.

1664
02:14:56,470 --> 02:14:58,970
世事的发展还真是奇妙
How strange, the way things work.

1665
02:14:58,980 --> 02:15:00,800
正如你所预言的
The Pope's doing exactly what you said he'd do

1666
02:15:00,810 --> 02:15:02,510
教皇清理门户了
he's cleaning house.

1667
02:15:03,450 --> 02:15:05,770
他应该谨慎
He should be careful.

1668
02:15:05,780 --> 02:15:07,710
