1
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,880
Don't you stop, mate.

2
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,000
Gimme.

3
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,920
Whoo-hoo! Been playing poker?

4
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,576
You Air Force pussy boys
wanna play for cash?

5
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,640
Fuck!

6
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,840
I can't even deal myself
a good hand.

7
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,640
Bets. I don't have any more.
So, check, then.

8
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,080
Check. OK.

9
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,160
I'll check too, then.
Show us your cards, Mikey.

10
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,360
Pair of Queens.

11
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,800
Full house.

12
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,800
Let's just call me moneybags!
Mullah, man!

13
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,400
Give it back, man. I need it.

14
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,136
It's not my money. I've gotta pick
my mum's prescription up.

15
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,200
Shouldn't gamble
if he can't afford to lose it.

16
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,960
Don't be a shit. Just give it back.

17
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,456
You know his mum's sick. You've
still got the rest of the money.

18
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,520
OK, I'll give you
your ten bucks back.

19
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,040
If... you jump.

20
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,760
I can't do that, man.
I-I'm afraid of heights.

21
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,440
And the rocks move. It'll be fine,
bro. Three steps. We checked it out.

22
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,440
Just give me the fucking money, man!
What fucking money?

23
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,840
Any money around here belongs to me.
Cough it up.

24
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,120
What are you playing, 52 pick up?
Piss off, Victor.

25
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,120
Paul, tell your brother Jake won
that money fair and square.

26
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,120
Shut your mouth, septic.
I'll bash you just for fun.

27
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,160
You got any money?

28
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,400
We could play a hand.

29
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,560
Two. Two. Three.

30
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,240
Three.

31
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,560
All right... show you cards.

32
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,160
- Pair of Aces.
- What've you got?

33
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,320
Three nines. Let's go, boys!

34
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,800
Fuck you!

35
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,880
Oh, shit! Fuck!

36
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,080
Be safe, boys!

37
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,080
Whoo!

38
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,360
Foley! I'll fucking get you!

39
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,200
I will fucking find you! Fuck!

40
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,720
Fuck!

41
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,000
Come on!

42
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,880
Hey, Mikey? Yeah.
Here's your tenner. For what?

43
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,920
You jumped! I didn't mean to.

44
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,560
I'm at the gallery.

45
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,760
No, no, just dropped something off.
Excuse me?

46
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,960
OK? Bye.

47
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,440
Yeah. Sorry?

48
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,080
No, I'm sorry.
This is gonna sound really odd,

49
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,960
but I wanna thank you. I took these
shots of you in the gallery.

50
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,760
And I really am sorry.

51
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,560
I just saw the way
you were looking at the art.

52
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,200
There was just something
in the way you were taking it in.

53
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,920
Can I buy you a coffee or something?
Can we talk?

54
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,040
I don't want a coffee.
Do you know what the Archibald is?

55
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,880
It's a portrait prize. Yeah.
Yeah? I wanna paint you for that.

56
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,480
But, technically, we've gotta
spend a bit of time together.

57
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,016
Thing is, there's a form that needs
to be signed, and I don't have it,

58
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,640
but maybe... you could just say,

59
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,216
"Alira Morley has permission
to paint my portrait."

60
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,960
You just have to say your name.

61
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,280
The competition's not for six
months, so I've got plenty of time.

62
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,840
Alira Morley has permission
to paint my porch.

63
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,040
OK, I'm gonna go that way. No, not
yet. You gotta say your name.

64
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,560
Jake Foley.

65
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,320
Could you maybe say your age
and what you do? Is that OK?

66
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,680
I'm 57.

67
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,000
And I'm a gambler.

68
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,120
Is that for real?

69
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,440
You're a gambler? Yeah.

70
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,960
Like on sports, horses, greyhounds,
that kind of thing?

71
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,600
No.

72
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,240
I play poker.

73
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,280
Right on!

74
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,520
Well, thanks.

75
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,440
Maybe if I make the shortlist,
I'll see you at the exhibition?

76
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,760
No, you won't.

77
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,400
An object won't change its motion

78
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,016
Unless a force acts on it.

79
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,240
That's one of Newton's laws.

80
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,976
From the time we were teenagers,
Mikey, Alex. Paul, Drew and I.

81
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,336
From the time we were teenagers,
Mikey, Alex. Paul, Drew and I

82
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,840
were an inseparable band of pirates.

83
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
But for quite a while now,

84
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,880
Life and circumstance...
have been pulling us apart.

85
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,880
And time is running out
to apply the force

86
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
that would bring us back together.

87
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,320
Of all the boys,
my best friend was Drew.

88
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,920
We had a lot in common.
Our dad's were Air Force pilots,

89
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,560
We liked to take risks, and we both
love card games, specifically poker.

90
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,896
Five card draw, seven card stud,
Texas Hold'em, Omaha,

91
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,680
Razz, Badugi, Chinese,
deuce to seven triple draw,

92
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,720
any kind of poker.

93
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,760
When the first personal computers
came along,

94
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,480
we were all over it, adapting them
to suit us,

95
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,040
Writing our own programs
for the games we wanted to play.

96
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,080
And in '94, we set up the world's
first online poker system.

97
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:23,977
When the larger markets
opened to us...

98
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:26,080
When the larger markets
opened to us

99
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,040
that was a waterfall.

100
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,440
More money
than we'd ever dreamed of.

101
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,280
Then Drew hit on something else.

102
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,600
By restructuring the code
from cards to countries,

103
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,520
he retooled the program

104
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,816
Into a sale able military grade
surveillance software.

105
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,160
We called it RIFFLE.
Shit name, I know.

106
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,520
Our customers are governments.

107
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,240
But life's just a game, right?

108
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,160
It's all in how you read
and respond to your opponents.

109
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,480
You watch how they bet,
how much they bet.

110
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,440
Everything they do informs you more.

111
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,080
If luck is leaving you, apply
what you can to change its motion.

112
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,120
Hey, I'm Jake.

113
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,840
Keep walking.

114
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,976
Maximise your wins,
minimise your losses...

115
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,080
Maximise your wins,
minimise your losses,

116
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,240
and stay in the game
as long as you can.

117
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,120
I'm Paje.

118
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,760
You can call me Bill. Jake.

119
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,040
Yeah.

120
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,040
Did you bring something else
to wear? Yeah. Yeah.

121
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,320
This is your space.

122
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,360
Join me outside.

123
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,280
The medicine is telling me
you're not ready yet.

124
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
So we wait.

125
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,960
We can talk if you want.

126
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,200
I'll talk, then.

127
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,320
Most people come here...
for the shared experience.

128
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,360
Safety in numbers.

129
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,400
A shared journey.

130
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:39,977
There are only three types of people
who come here.

131
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:42,360
There are only three types of people
who come here

132
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,560
for a private appointment.

133
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,320
There's the morbidly famous
who are afraid of their own shadow.

134
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,920
The drug fucked

135
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,880
who quite mistakenly think
this is the next great high.

136
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,000
And the incurably curious.

137
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,600
Now, I don't recognise your face.

138
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,320
You don't appear to be in need.

139
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,160
But there is a weight on you

140
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:15,080
And... it's related
to your mortality.

141
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,200
How am I doing so far?

142
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,680
100%.

143
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,280
Death is inevitable.

144
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,080
All living things will die.

145
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,360
You have to recognise that
with relief.

146
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,360
Embrace that knowledge.

147
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,360
In my entire life

148
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,880
the time I've spent
pondering my own mortality

149
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,600
Would add up to minutes, if that.

150
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,000
Maybe when my wife Allison died,

151
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,896
I... I did ask the universe a lot
of questions then.

152
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,480
I never got
any satisfactory answers.

153
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,120
The answers don't always have
the structure we expect.

154
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,680
Sometimes,
the insistence of the question

155
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,080
Can drown out the response.

156
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,920
Let's go and untie some knots.

157
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,960
The next few years.

158
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:45,320
Over the next few days, there will
always be someone here with you.

159
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,360
Sometimes the body wants to merge.

160
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,800
...is for
what comes out of your mouth.

161
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,640
You will know
when it's time to drink.

162
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,976
Reject the quest
for your question...

163
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,440
Reject the quest
for your question

164
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,920
to the front of your mind.

165
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,600
You will know

166
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,120
When it's time.

167
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,200
Opening up to yourself...
is one thing.

168
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,840
Opening up to others
may still be hard.

169
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:19,977
When the time's right...

170
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:21,880
When the time's right

171
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,560
you might be able to use this.

172
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,760
What is it?

173
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Let's just call it a truth serum.

174
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,600
A couple of drops and you'll say
what's on your mind.

175
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,520
Perfectly harmless in small doses.

176
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,360
You're sweating.
It can unlock doors.

177
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:43,977
It would take 10mls or more...

178
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:47,280
It would take 10mls or more

179
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,520
directly injected to be lethal.

180
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,976
Some people take comfort.

181
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,920
Some people take comfort

182
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,080
in knowing that they have...
some means of control.

183
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,000
Hone that strength.

184
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,960
Go!

185
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,080
Good, girl. Break there.

186
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,640
Ready?

187
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,920
Hey, you.

188
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,016
You got in here like a ninja.

189
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,640
I didn't hear one step.
What are you doing?

190
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,400
Just checking out the house,
making sure everything's ready. Oh.

191
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
Yes, big poker game.

192
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,160
You haven't done that in years.

193
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,056
Yeah, well, they've been busy,
I've been busy, that's all.

194
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,880
Anyway, taking a break from old
friends sometimes

195
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,080
just reminds you how much they
mean to you. I love those guys.

196
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,977
They are just as much
my posse of delinquent uncles.

197
00:20:08,001 --> 00:20:10,680
They are just as much
my posse of delinquent uncles

198
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,560
as they are your school buddies. I
will make sure they hear that, baby.

199
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,560
I have a more serious question.

200
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,400
Does it involve cash?
Am I your favourite child

201
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,240
and most special daughter?

202
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,696
I can guarantee that,
mainly because you are

203
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,640
my only child and only daughter.

204
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,120
Hmm. As your favourite child
and most special daughter,

205
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,720
There's the cutest denim jacket
down in the arcade. Mm-hm.

206
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,760
So I was wondering...

207
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,360
Yeah. Yeah.

208
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,240
It's cuter than that.

209
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,200
Hmm.

210
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,520
Look at what you've built.

211
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,840
Mum would have been so proud of you.

212
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,976
Hey, come on...

213
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,200
Hey, come on

214
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,120
don't get yourself upset.

215
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,320
Your mum... is with us every day.

216
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,000
She sees everything.

217
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,080
And you know what, she'd much
rather see you laughing than crying.

218
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,440
I just miss her.

219
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,960
I didn't think
I could live... a day without her,

220
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
let alone ten years.

221
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,600
Jake. Sam.

222
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,920
Let me see. Fuck!

223
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,800
Now... if you decide
on a testamentary trust,

224
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,040
and we know
that time is of the essence,

225
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,560
then you will have to nominate
a trustee. That trustee

226
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,440
can be a person or persons,
an organisation or a trust company.

227
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,456
If you still wanna explore the idea
of a charitable trust,

228
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,800
then, in addition, the trustee
will have to nominate...

229
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,920
The trust administrator
will report back,

230
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,800
And defend the rights
of your beneficiaries.

231
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,040
Now, look, I know this is a lot
to take in.

232
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,840
If you do the structure right, I
guarantee it'll be tight as a drum.

233
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,560
And in regards to tonight,
everything's in place.

234
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,960
I'm gonna meet the guys
down in the garage in ten minutes.

235
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,560
Once I'm done, I'll meet you at
the pad. The pilot's standing by.

236
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,880
Good.

237
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
Have you told Drew?

238
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,920
Not all the details, no.

239
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,440
Devil's advocate.

240
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,880
Tonight is all very elaborate, Jake.

241
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,480
You certain
you wanna go through with it?

242
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,720
And this time I'm not asking
as your lawyer.

243
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,920
Plenty of people get by
with flowers and cards.

244
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,920
Well, they might not be the best
decisions I've ever made,

245
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,600
but at least I won't live
to regret them.

246
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,560
See you down there.

247
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,280
Yes.

248
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,440
Sorry.

249
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,480
What for?

250
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,720
It was necessary.

251
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,976
Minister. Minister. The report
on Family Affairs released today.

252
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,056
Minister. Minister. The report
on Family Affairs released today

253
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,200
seems to contradict the stated
intentions of your department

254
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,040
just earlier this year.
Beverly, what you're really saying

255
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,600
is the press contrived
to misunderstand

256
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,200
the position we took last year.

257
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,480
My department is putting the needs
of lower-income families first.

258
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,256
And I know you personally support
that, Beverly. No, minister...

259
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,280
Minister!

260
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,920
Did you get the text? What the fuck
are we doing meeting in a car park?

261
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,080
I thought we were
meeting in the penthouse.

262
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,920
Hello, Paul. Good to see you too.

263
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,200
Maybe the car park's where the
private lift is, Minister? Yeah,

264
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,760
course it is. Let's do this.

265
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,600
You wanna wait for Alex? That
arselicker's probably already here.

266
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,320
You look like shit, by the way.
Tremendous.

267
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,080
Beautiful.

268
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,360
OK? Yeah.

269
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,000
You just have to tell him.
Get it done.

270
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,000
Yeah.

271
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:28,640
It's on tonight, all right.
Just... don't forget the gear.

272
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,320
You never know
who you're gonna bump into, Billy.

273
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,240
Some old mate you owe a favour to.

274
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,720
Look, this bloke's different,
he's Polish or something,

275
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,560
But we need him. He's connected
and he knows what's what.

276
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,280
So just don't use your prison charm,
OK?

277
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,880
That's all I'm asking, mate,
just nice and easy.

278
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,360
Gentlemen. Alex.

279
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,560
How are you, mate?
I'm good. You?

280
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,600
The annoying one's
apologised. Nice to meet you.

281
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:11,977
So, are are we going upstairs or...?
Actually, Jake thought.

282
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:15,160
So, are are we going upstairs or...?
Actually, Jake thought

283
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,720
you might like to meet him down at
Pebble Cove.

284
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,520
So he would like you guys to pick
a car to drive.

285
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,120
Anyone you like. You're kidding?

286
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,400
Keys are all in 'em. SatNavs are
programmed with the scenic route.

287
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,241
Travel time's about 90 minutes,

288
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,760
but Jake would like you to think
of it as a race.

289
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,576
Jakey, Jakey, Jakey!
Where are you going?

290
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,800
Mike, I'm Sam. Hey, Sam.

291
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,400
Cars! You keep away,
that thing's mine.

292
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,160
You keep away.

293
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,480
So, have you caught up with Jake
much lately.

294
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,560
Oh, not much. I've...
I've been travelling.

295
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,680
A coupla book tours and such.
Yeah.

296
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,080
Yeah, life gets busy, eh?
Yeah, it does.

297
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,800
Mike, I'm afraid,
I'm gonna have to drive you.

298
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,200
You're kidding me?
It was a fucking sip!

299
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,600
Ahh!

300
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,880
We're taking that one.
Nice choice.

301
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,800
Is anyone gonna say go?

302
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,480
"Turn right."

303
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,160
Hey. You good?

304
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,320
"Yeah, brother. How you all doing?"

305
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,240
You gonna tune in tonight?
"Right on showtime.

306
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,880
Look, Jake, are you really sure you
want it to go down this way, man?"

307
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,120
There needs to be a catalyst.

308
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,536
We haven't had
an honest conversation in years.

309
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,680
And I don't have time to wait around

310
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,640
for these guys to get comfortable
enough to tell me the truth.

311
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,800
"Yeah... I get it, brother."

312
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,120
See you soon. "Yeah, see you."

313
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,360
Fuck me, mate!

314
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,400
Everything OK? Super car race
with a soft cock for a chauffeur.

315
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,800
Everything's peachy!

316
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,576
Yeah, all the specs say
we have the fastest car.

317
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,680
Mm-hm. It's got a race engine.

318
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,800
You're in a race.

319
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,040
Maybe put your fucking foot down!

320
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,976
There are fresh ingredients
in the fridge if you wanna cook.

321
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,200
Everything you need
for grilled oysters

322
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,040
is in the fridge by the barbecue.
Great. Is Penelope here?

323
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,096
Yes, she is. Downstairs, sir.

324
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,480
The guests are gonna be arriving
in three separate cars.

325
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,760
Meet them in the garage, take them
to their rooms down the backstairs.

326
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,136
No problem. After that, you guys
can take the night off.

327
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,160
Put the gate on code only.

328
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,216
Hello, Mr Jake. Everything good?
Everything in place, sir? Great.

329
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,960
I think I might cook tonight.
You sure you wanna do that, Mr Jake?

330
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,920
I'll try not to make a mess.

331
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,920
"Hello."
Thank fuck! Did you get my message?

332
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,640
Don't go to the house tonight.
The plan has changed.

333
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,776
"I'm not changing plans.
Everything's been organised."

334
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,760
No, no, you have to change the plan.
I thought the house would be empty.

335
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,120
He'll be there.
"It's going ahead.

336
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:04,160
Time to clear your debt."
No, it can't go ahead tonight!

337
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,800
You hear me? He'll be there!

338
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,160
I'll be there.
It's too close! He'll know.

339
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,040
Please, man, just back the fuck off!

340
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,880
Fuck! Fuck!

341
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,080
Having fun, Mr Foley?

342
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,840
Penelope.

343
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,976
Did Sam tell you what's going on?
Only that it's big stakes.

344
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,960
Did Sam tell you what's going on?
Only that it's big stakes

345
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,920
and that I'll probably finish early.
He didn't elaborate.

346
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,960
RFID chips. Live and legal tender.

347
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,400
Cash.

348
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,960
Five equal stacks, Texas Hold'em.

349
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Yes, boss.

350
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,120
Yes, of course.

351
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,320
Hey, look... I gotta go.

352
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,040
Bye. Love you.

353
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,680
Mikey! Let's go!

354
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,840
You all right? Yep.

355
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,000
Let's hit it.

356
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,840
There he is. Alex.

357
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,320
Good to see you, Jake. Hiya.

358
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,120
Paul.
Jakey boy. Always a pleasure.

359
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,600
Mike.
Jake. Look at this!

360
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,640
OK?

361
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,920
All good, Mr Foley? All good, Chris.
See you tomorrow.

362
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,800
You do know there are other wines
beside Henschke.

363
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,440
Yeah, I have a rule with wine, don't
buy it unless you're gonna drink it.

364
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,760
I knew you would say something like
that, so small vineyard,

365
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,840
McLaren Vale shiraz. Nice.
A velvet glove.

366
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,840
Hmm. Salute. It's been too long.

367
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,280
Cheers, lads.
To Drew and to you Jake.

368
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,120
Absent friends.

369
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,320
How is Drew? Good.

370
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,440
Mmm! How were the cars?

371
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,720
Oh, that Maybach is amazing!
I put my foot down and I was here.

372
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,120
Yeah, I wouldn't know
how mine was to drive,

373
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,840
cos you sent the fucking fun police
over there.

374
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,720
Well, I'm glad you liked the cars,
because they're yours.

375
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,080
My gift. What?

376
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,320
I mean, that Maybach
is a million-dollar car, Jake.

377
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,240
Forgive my cynicism, but what's
the catch? There's no catch.

378
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,376
I just thought we'd have a bit
of fun and up the stakes tonight.

379
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,320
The cars are yours,
titles signed over to you,

380
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,200
or... you can give up the dream car

381
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,240
and exchange it,

382
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,256
For $5 million in chips each.

383
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,480
Holy shit! $5 million?
Texas Hold'em.

384
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,520
Winner take all.

385
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:08,760
There's a couple of wrinkles. One,
you have to play, you can't sit out.

386
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,176
Two, if one of you wants to keep
the car, then that's that.

387
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,880
It's one in, all in, and we'll
just play for our usual stakes.

388
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,680
Fuck! Which car came first?
The Maybach.

389
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,080
That puts you on the button, Alex.
You just gotta make the decision.

390
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,160
Do you want the car,
or do you want the chips?

391
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,920
I'll leave you to discuss it.
Sam, can answer your questions?

392
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,720
Just remember, if you do play

393
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,120
you have to accept the outcome.

394
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,160
If you don't play

395
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,520
You have to accept
that outcome too.

396
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,880
W-Wait. Before we start,

397
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,640
We can't do this. Can't do what?

398
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,600
We can't take the cars. You're damn
right we can't take the cars.

399
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,096
It's five million in chips. It's
poker night, let's fucking go!

400
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,800
We can't take the cars or the chips.

401
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,840
This is crazy!

402
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,280
I mean, let's just play
for our normal stakes, eh?

403
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,800
I don't wanna feel like
I owe Jake anything.

404
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,640
This is five million in chips each.

405
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,840
Right, Sam? Mm-hm.

406
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,880
So, what's it gonna be, gents?

407
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,440
25 million on the table.

408
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,840
Who are these guys?
The guys I grew up with.

409
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,280
I'm giving 'em
a couple of the big experiences,

410
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,360
and fucking with their heads
for old times' sake.

411
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,640
They will probably say stupid shit.
When they drink, OK?

412
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,800
And they'll flirt with the bedposts
if they think they've half a chance.

413
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,920
Mikey, wait. Just...

414
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
This is too much.

415
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,880
You know, I'm doing OK,
I don't need this.

416
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,560
I'm happy for you, Alex,
that you're doing OK,

417
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,320
that your books are selling,
that's great.

418
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,000
I'm not doing OK.

419
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,360
And I wanna play.

420
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,400
Just say yes, Alex. Fine.

421
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,400
What about you, Paul?

422
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:13,456
I think we should... just say yes,
Alex.

423
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,480
Mm-hm.

424
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,240
They're in. Good.

425
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,960
We're doing this.
Yeah, we're doing this.

426
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,280
You don't do things by halves, Jake.
Cheers. Cheers.

427
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,000
It's just a game, Alex.

428
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,320
This is a beautiful drop.

429
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,520
Sweet Jesus! Fuck me!

430
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,560
Not that I don't appreciate the
wine, Jake, it's fucking lovely,

431
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,480
but I'll grab myself
a poker player's drink.

432
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,920
Take the bottle. Cheers.

433
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,960
Let's go, eh?

434
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,840
There's a humidor over there
if you like. Don't mind if I do.

435
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,136
Hello. I'm Michael.
I'm Penelope.

436
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,080
Are you left or right-handed?
I'm right.

437
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,760
You'll be fine.

438
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,760
Good evening, gentlemen.
I'm your dealer for tonight.

439
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,240
My name is Penelope.
Hello, Penelope, I'm Paul.

440
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,440
Hi, Paul. Alex. Alex.

441
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,120
On my right hand here, Michael.

442
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,456
It's a five million buy in.
No rebuys. Texas Hold'em.

443
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,080
Winner takes all. We will start
the small blind at 25,000,

444
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,720
the big blind at 50,000.

445
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,400
Good luck to you all.

446
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,880
So, if you love art so much,
then why do you steal it?

447
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,920
To possess it.

448
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,600
Even just briefly, to be close
enough to smell the canvas,

449
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,760
to touch the brush strokes,

450
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,280
To have possessed it.

451
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,640
Maybe it's just a bit too obtuse

452
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,680
and deep for you, Billy.

453
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,920
Maybe you're just not smart enough
to understand.

454
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,440
I'm smart enough to know
which part of your face

455
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,480
Is gonna bleed the most.

456
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,600
Fucking ferret!

457
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Here comes the target.

458
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,000
Call. Call.

459
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,840
Raise... 175.

460
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,800
Raise 175,000.

461
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,360
Out. Alex is out.

462
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,400
Call. Call.

463
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,720
Call. Call.

464
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,080
Check. Check.

465
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,680
Check. Bet. Bet 100,000.

466
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,400
Raise 400. Raise 400.

467
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,000
Call.

468
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,360
Call.

469
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,160
Sam's out.

470
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,000
Check. Check.

471
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,600
700,000.

472
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,280
Michael?

473
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,920
Raise two million.
Raise two million.

474
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,000
Paul is out.

475
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,200
All in. Jake goes all in.

476
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,720
Michael?

477
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,120
A quick game
is a good game, eh, Jake?

478
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,600
Thanks for the invite.
I call. All in.

479
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,520
First fucking hand.

480
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,760
Ten million in the pot.

481
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,680
Oh!
Oh, you both have the same cards.

482
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,280
Jack and ten. Michael has hearts,
Jake has diamonds.

483
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:02,040
We have a straight
or a possible flush draw on both.

484
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,560
Split pot, gentlemen.

485
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,680
Right down the middle.

486
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,760
Straight down the middle.

487
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,120
Talking about you walking
from Melbourne to Sydney,

488
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,136
For about 25 fucking years.

489
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,640
And the bit of the story
I've never figured out,

490
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,520
you didn't actually complete
the journey? Oh, I did, yeah.

491
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,600
I did. I did.

492
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,440
In a car.
Start telling that story

493
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,640
in the future about the walk you
did from Melbourne to Sydney,

494
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,640
Tell the story about the walk from
Melbourne to Orbost. That's right.

495
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,640
It is false advertising, mate.

496
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,536
It's a big title, and the story
doesn't live up to the title.

497
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,280
Absolutely false advertising.
A bit like your last book.

498
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,640
And then he proceeded to offer me
this... cigarette.

499
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,080
Did you imbibe? I did.
I thought it would be rude not to.

500
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,920
So, anyway, I don't feel
particularly different,

501
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,536
until later that night, I went
upstairs to the restaurant,

502
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,880
and I'm watching this band,
and then I turn around

503
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,160
And look out the window, and I came
back and there's the kitchen.

504
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,520
The band's fucking disappeared!

505
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,840
So I look out the window again,
there's the band again.

506
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,840
And I'm fucking falling over
all the time going,

507
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,040
"I must be really
out of my mind here."

508
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,000
It took me about an hour to realise

509
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:53,136
That it was a revolving rooftop
restaurant.

510
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,120
You fucking idiot! I know.
That's brilliant!

511
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,960
And that was my start in politics.

512
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,040
Oh, fuck off!

513
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,096
Mr Foley
left me a gift in my locker.

514
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,600
No, I'm gonna show you
when I get home.

515
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,176
We can go anywhere you want.
Look, I'm excited.

516
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,560
You've gotta see it to believe it.
Look, I'm on my way home now,

517
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,600
I'll see you soon.

518
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,200
What's going on, man?!

519
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,520
We get to Vegas,
we get to the hotel rooms,

520
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:03,000
so I start go ogling...
arse problems.

521
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,920
Caution! Caution!
My arse is in danger!

522
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,720
Right. Every time
you flinch your sphincter,

523
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,960
it was like an electric shock
through my body.

524
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
We get to this specialist, and I lay
down, and Alex is there with me.

525
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,440
Thank you, Alex. And I lay down,

526
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,960
And he has a look at it.
He's like, "Oh, yep!"

527
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,920
"Yeah, you've got
a perianal abscess." Ohh!

528
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,680
It was a terrific weekend in Vegas,
wasn't it, Alex?

529
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,400
"Hey, Bec."

530
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,680
When were you going to tell me?

531
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,720
Er, hey, I'm driving,

532
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,760
this is some pretty big stuff.

533
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,320
Just let me pull over and we can
talk properly.

534
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:47,080
I'm a kid, is that it? I can't
handle reality or something?

535
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,440
"What's the reason
for keeping me in that dark?"

536
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,976
Listen, kiddo...

537
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Listen, kiddo

538
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,880
about five months ago...

539
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,760
This is really hard.

540
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,160
Your dad had a vasectomy. OK?

541
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:13,280
"He didn't... He just did it,
he didn't discuss it with me."

542
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:15,977
Now I've always known
that your dad, he...

543
00:48:16,001 --> 00:48:18,560
Now I've always known
that your dad, he

544
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:23,240
he loves you so much. And he didn't
wanna complicate your life

545
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,721
"With a half-sibling
when you were younger."

546
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,640
But I always thought that

547
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,720
we would eventually get the chance
to have a baby.

548
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,360
So the vasectomy news

549
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,560
that was, er

550
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,960
I've been in his office

551
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,960
looking at his medical records.

552
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:47,977
He was diagnosed in September.

553
00:48:48,001 --> 00:48:50,080
He was diagnosed in September

554
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,960
with pancreatic cancer.

555
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,000
"He's dying!

556
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,800
He's dying!"

557
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,920
He wasn't going to tell me!

558
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,440
It's OK, Bec,

559
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,760
I'm gonna come and get you, OK?"

560
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:13,616
Just stay where you are, OK?
It's OK, honey, I'm coming.

561
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,760
I'm gonna come and get you and then

562
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,640
we'll both go and talk to your dad
together, OK?

563
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,000
500.

564
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:41,120
Hey, Sam,
go and check that out for me.

565
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,280
The door might not be closed,
it's activating the system.

566
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,320
Yeah, no problem.

567
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:53,376
Just two pair.
Didn't actually have the eight.

568
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,400
Again!

569
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,440
Look at this guy.

570
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,976
I hope he's a better lawyer.

571
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,840
I hope he's a better lawyer

572
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,760
than he is a card player.
So do I.

573
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,800
Call.

574
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,520
Anyone of you motherfuckers
gonna deal me in? Drew!

575
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,360
Drew! Hey, Drew!

576
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,320
What's up, brother? How you doing?

577
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:45,160
What's up, brother?

578
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,320
Get the man a drink.
What are you having, Drew?

579
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:50,200
Tequila on ice, slice of pineapple.

580
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,480
Alrighty. He likes his fruit.

581
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:56,320
Hey. Some things
I need to catch you up on.

582
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,840
Yeah, I'm seeing the big money move.

583
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,320
I know I said I wasn't
gonna make it, but...

584
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,160
Are we gonna keep playing?
No, I don't think so.

585
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,560
Where's she going?
We're still playing, aren't we?

586
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,880
Fuck me!

587
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,240
Jake asked me to turn RIFFLE
on to you guys this week.

588
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,240
Why would you turn a military grade
surveillance program me on us?

589
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,960
At first it was just for laughs,

590
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,680
maybe catch you scratching
your balls in your driveway,

591
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,560
show it on poker night. But RIFFLE
doesn't stop,

592
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:59,520
it crisscrosses your cell phones,
home security, computers.

593
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:02,120
Now, I'm not saying
we know everything,

594
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,440
but we know enough to get me
on a motherfucking plane.

595
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,480
I feel sick!

596
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:19,600
I'm not surprised, Alex.
I poisoned you.

597
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,720
On the base
of your toasting glasses.

598
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:26,080
It would have got on your hands...
your faces.

599
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,560
And now it's in your bloodstream.

600
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,320
That's not funny.

601
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,520
Are you serious?!

602
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,960
Poisoned? Fuck off, he's joking.

603
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,920
Is he?

604
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,960
I'm sweating like a motherfucker.

605
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,960
I don't feel too good.
First signs are sweating

606
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,880
Loss of balance, nausea, and then...
Then what?

607
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,920
Stop fucking around.

608
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,960
You want us dead?

609
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:06,400
I've been diagnosed with an
inoperable pancreatic cancer.

610
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,800
It's a death sentence.

611
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,320
So now we're all on the same level.

612
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,320
Touch pad. Bring him over.

613
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,240
Beautiful.

614
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:27,360
You've done the job for me.
Jesus! Fuck!

615
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:32,080
What the fuck, Mikey? What was you
gonna do, shoot us? Shoot Jake? Me.

616
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,800
I was gonna shoot me.

617
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,640
That was the plan.

618
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:43,560
I was gonna say goodbye to you
all and... shoot myself.

619
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:47,200
Is this about the business? You
think, we was gonna let you drown?

620
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:51,520
Why didn't you reach out? Yeah. I
had no idea you were this unhappy.

621
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:56,040
I put back two bottles of vodka
a day, Alex.

622
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,840
That's not the habit
of a happy person.

623
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,560
I'm all right with death.

624
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,840
I'm not!

625
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,840
I have a wife and kids.
I've got people who depend on me.

626
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,000
What is the code?

627
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,560
I can't tell you.
What's the code?

628
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,840
You want another one?
What is the fucking code?

629
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Car! Car, car!

630
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,920
Get rid of the van! Come on.

631
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,280
I said get down! Get down!

632
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,800
Hey... no noise, you hear me?

633
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,680
Right, when the car goes through,

634
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,800
Jumped in front of the gates,
stop 'em from closing.

635
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,200
What?

636
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,800
It doesn't work that way,
it keeps going.

637
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:57,736
- The gate can crush the car.
- Is that right? Thanks.

638
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,560
You got a bunch of bank accounts,
Paul. Savings, checking,

639
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,720
all on zero. How's that taking care
of your family?

640
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,840
I'm being blackmailed.

641
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,080
They've got video of me with a girl.
If it comes out, I'm

642
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:27,880
I gave them all the money I have,
they want more than I have.

643
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,520
Tell me the code.

644
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,560
Tell me the code
or you're gonna get crushed!

645
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,576
Fucking hurry up, mates. Tell me the
code or you're gonna get crushed.

646
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:41,480
Oi! Code. You're gonna turn into
a puddle in a minute. Code.

647
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,840
Tell him!

648
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,480
1967!

649
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:03,000
I thought we were just here
to steal, we are murderers now?

650
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,720
You'll only get manslaughter
at most.

651
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,576
And after you couldn't give the
dude no more money, what did you do?

652
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,600
What did you give 'em, Paul?

653
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,160
Jake.

654
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:23,400
Email addresses, phone numbers

655
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,080
sensitive information.

656
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:30,880
I was just trying to buy time.
I promise, Jake. I'm sorry, man.

657
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,920
Who's blackmailing you?

658
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,400
Victor. Your brother?!

659
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,360
Yeah, my brother.

660
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:53,600
I'm just so fucking ashamed!

661
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,840
Oh, fuck! What is it?

662
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,560
I'm having an affair.

663
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:13,000
A terribly inexact word.

664
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,280
Insufficient.

665
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:22,200
It was never my intention
to deliberately betray anyone.

666
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:27,800
What happened to me, Jake,
is that I fell in love.

667
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:31,160
It just so happens I fell in love
with the woman you're married to.

668
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,640
I can't die.

669
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,360
We're having a baby.

670
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,920
I can't die.

671
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,600
You're not gonna fucking die.

672
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,200
Not tonight, anyway.

673
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:00,280
I just used a couple of drops,
nowhere near enough to kill you.

674
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:03,280
Just enough to fuck you up
and get you thinking.

675
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,160
It'll wear off soon.

676
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,961
I just wanted you for a moment
to feel where I am.

677
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,960
To see things through my eyes.

678
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,400
My little girl
is about to be hit by a train.

679
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,976
And there's nothing
I can do about it...

680
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,560
And there's nothing
I can do about it

681
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,640
cos I am the train.

682
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,800
So how long have you got, man?

683
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,480
Long enough to finish the game?

684
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,680
Fuck!

685
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:57,456
Lawyers recommend trust funds so
they can keep charging annual fees.

686
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:00,400
In fact, in most instances, simply
transferring money

687
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,880
is a tax-free gift
to any normal bank account.

688
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,880
That's the better option.

689
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,960
You fucking guys don't get it.

690
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,840
Jake and I brought you into
the company at the ground level.

691
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:20,080
Mikey, you sold your shares in a
week. Alex traded his for a Rolex.

692
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:23,200
And Paul goes to Vegas first class.

693
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,400
Now, if it was up to me,

694
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,760
I would have given you all
that we put aside for you.

695
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,640
And I told him, "Chill the fuck out,
let's just start them with half."

696
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,720
Because we know you motherfuckers.

697
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,840
What do you mean?
We've still got shares? Yeah.

698
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,040
How much?

699
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,800
$25 million in poker chips.

700
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,920
Get fucked!

701
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:02,840
Erm, Jake?

702
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,960
What the fuck?

703
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,216
I hope this isn't another one
of your surprises, Jake? No.

704
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,440
It's Victor. He's here for the art.

705
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,480
Ah, fuck!

706
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,400
When you said then house
was full of Australian art,

707
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:23,440
did you mean pieces like this?
They don't know where we are,

708
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:27,560
Let's fuck off before they find
the stairs. Through the cellar.

709
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,440
Aboriginal art is not my forte.

710
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,920
Are they worth anything?
Well, yes, some of them are.

711
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,440
Very expensive, but...
the market for this art

712
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,480
attracts a certain type of buyer

713
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,640
who connects with it
on a spiritual plane.

714
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,320
It's a big house, find us something
we can sell.

715
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,640
Do you think the place is empty?

716
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,760
Three cars came in, four came out,
all different cars.

717
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,040
Shush! Don't fucking shush me!

718
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,120
They have guns.

719
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,640
Don't worry about that.

720
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,680
Warhol.

721
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:23,000
Well, he's famous, right?
Too famous.

722
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,160
It's a Sunday B Morning print.

723
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,280
A couple of grand retail if that.

724
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,320
Not for us.

725
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,720
Not bad.

726
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,000
Henry James John stone.

727
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,440
Hard to find in this condition.

728
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:01,136
Look at the way
he painted the light.

729
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,720
He came to Australia
to mine for gold,

730
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,320
ironically, became a photographer.

731
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:09,200
Valuable? Hmm.

732
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,800
We could probably sell them.

733
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:14,080
It wouldn't be a big ticket, though.

734
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,360
Oi!

735
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,560
Stairs down here.

736
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:33,000
Shh!

737
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,920
"All right, here we go."

738
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,760
You want a drink?

739
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,000
Somebody already has.

740
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,360
Oh.

741
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,600
Look at this! Nice!

742
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,240
And this is a fucking
two storeys underground. Boom!

743
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:21,160
Nobody's home. Yes, there is.

744
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,960
This cigar didn't light itself.

745
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,720
There's a lot of eye candy in here.

746
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
They're hiding somewhere.

747
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,960
Billy, check around.

748
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,720
OK, we got the guns, let's stop
these fuckers. I don't have guns.

749
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,320
You got a panic room, no firearms?

750
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:47,320
I've got a panic room
so I don't need firearms.

751
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:51,040
Victor, they probably
just fucked off. Look around!

752
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,960
OK.

753
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:58,280
Victor.
Victor, look at this room, man!

754
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:03,160
Top dollar!
It's like Ali Baba's cave, man!

755
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:08,360
What am I looking at?
1889. Melbourne.

756
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,840
9x5 Impression exhibition.

757
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,840
182 works painted mainly
on cigar box lids.

758
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:16,720
They sold for a guinea each,
a couple of bucks.

759
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:20,920
Tom Roberts, Arthur Street on,
Charles Conder.

760
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,960
You've hit the trifecta!

761
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,480
Now you are looking at three million
at auction, easy.

762
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,440
Grey market to us,
high six figures.

763
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:31,880
Happy days!

764
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,240
I know you're still here, Jake.

765
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,960
Ha! Yes, you fucking are,
aren't you!

766
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,720
Hello, Jake. It's been a while.

767
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,640
Aren't you gonna say
hey to an old mate?

768
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:56,480
We ain't gonna hurt anyone,
we're just gonna take the art.

769
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,440
Ask the Minister why it's safer
not to call the cops.

770
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,440
Why the fuck are we on TV?

771
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,320
Because our host
is still somewhere in the house.

772
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:10,000
Check up those stairs.

773
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,440
What else is in here?

774
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:19,440
We were just gonna hit this place
in darkness.

775
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:19,977
Nothing personal. Then Paul said.

776
01:05:20,001 --> 01:05:22,040
Nothing personal. Then Paul said

777
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:25,480
you were gonna be here
and I thought, "Fuck it!

778
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,400
I wanna make it personal!"

779
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,360
A panic room? You can't shoot
a motherfucker with it.

780
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,880
We've got Mike's gun.
It's only got one bullet.

781
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:38,880
I was planning on killing myself,
you only need one bullet for that.

782
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:42,680
Clarice Beckett. Genius!

783
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,520
We can move these in a heartbeat.

784
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,720
Another Street on.

785
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,680
William Do bell.
Woman In Restaurant.

786
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,920
Last sold for 935,000!

787
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:01,016
John Peter Russell! So rare!
He had hardly ever exhibited.

788
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,400
Classmate of Lautrec and Van Gogh.

789
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:08,000
He destroyed 400 of his masterworks
in grief when his wife died.

790
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,960
This is real fucking money!
How much?

791
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,240
Even at bargain basement,
we are walking away

792
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,960
With a couple of million.

793
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,800
You hear that, Jake?

794
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,760
We know what you've got here!

795
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:24,360
Oi. The stairs lead to the kitchen.
I didn't see anyone there.

796
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,040
Just like I haven't seen anyone out
here or in the garage.

797
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,960
And you know what that is, Victor?
Cos there's no one fucking here.

798
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,520
Help Styx.

799
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,400
Let's go!

800
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,680
Jake, there's six of us and three of
them, we can take 'em.

801
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,160
It's only fucking Victor.

802
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,200
They've got three shotguns
against one bullet.

803
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,320
Let's just stay down here
until he fucks off, OK?

804
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:51,400
The more adrenalized he gets,
the harder that drug's gonna hit.

805
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:17,200
So, what's this worth?
A couple of hundred K maybe.

806
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:22,376
He painted a lot Street on. Even
with a less significant work,

807
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,960
he leaves his mark of genius. Look.

808
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,976
A lot of people believe that these
marks of reflection.

809
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:28,280
A lot of people believe that these
marks of reflection

810
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:32,480
are Street on painting a portrait of
himself painting the glass.

811
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:37,840
You see? It's like a man leaning
over an easel.

812
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,160
So, our mate had a green head,
did he?

813
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,400
I tell ya, there's a really good
painting in the kitchen.

814
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:47,160
It's a couple of men playing cards,
one's smoking a pipe,

815
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:51,120
wearing funny hats. That's the type
of painting I like. You know why?

816
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:54,720
Hmm? Cos it tells a fucking story.

817
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,640
A couple of blokes playing poker,

818
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:59,200
they're on the piss,
they're talking shit.

819
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:02,400
I mean,
that's just a fucking goblet.

820
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,960
A white pipe? Yeah.

821
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,640
A tall hat? Yeah, a funny hat.

822
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,520
Fuck!

823
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,800
Jesus! What's she doing here?

824
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:47,040
Billy! Visitors.

825
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:49,520
Who's this, Jake?

826
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:54,560
Plan's changed. Give me the gun.
There's only one bullet in it, man.

827
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:58,360
They don't know that. Mikey, we're
gonna go with your plan.

828
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:02,480
I'll bluff this prick and I'll split
'em up. I'll come with you.

829
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,000
Get the door, Mike.

830
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:07,600
Dad? Dad?

831
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:11,000
Hello, ladies.
Oh, hello, ladies!

832
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:14,240
- Come on, come here.
- Come here.

833
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,520
Get off!

834
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,920
Come here. Argh!

835
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,240
Shit!

836
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:27,960
Come here!

837
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,560
Come...
Come here you...

838
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,320
Come here!

839
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,920
Victor. Victor.

840
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:54,760
Victor! The painting in the kitchen
is a fucking Cezanne!

841
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:58,080
That's a $200 million item!

842
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:00,120
Who are we dealing with here?

843
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:04,320
People who own art like that have
got many ways of fucking you up.

844
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:07,680
Go... away!

845
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,520
My lucky day after all.

846
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,960
You know, things were looking dull
as shit till you turned up.

847
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,960
Well, this changes things,
doesn't it, Jake?

848
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,120
I'm assuming you know these women.

849
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:28,480
Come on in here, you prick!

850
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:32,840
- Do you hear me, Jake?
- Get your arse in here!

851
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,160
What the fuck, man?!

852
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,200
Dad! Shit!

853
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:40,120
Who the fuck is this?! Our host.

854
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:44,400
Jake... Fucking... Foley!

855
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:50,336
Lok at you, Big Shot. You come into
the room, gun in your hand,

856
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:55,400
like a common criminal. Victor.
I see you're the same shit magnet

857
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,616
Who goes around stealing
other people's stuff.

858
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:01,040
Don't get too cocky, Foley, you've
got three shotguns trained on you,

859
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:06,200
You can't get all of us!
I'm only aiming at you, Victor.

860
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:11,240
Well, I guess we're in
a Mexican stand-off my friend.

861
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,800
You shoot me,

862
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:18,320
I may or may not die, depends if you
can shoot really, doesn't it?

863
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:19,976
And even if you get me, these two
will still shoot you, take your art.

864
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,416
And even if you get me, these two
will still shoot you, take your art

865
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:25,800
and damage these fine specimens.
No, I won't.

866
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:28,200
I'm here to steal,
I'm not damaging anyone.

867
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:31,480
I will. If he kills you, Vic,
I'll defend your hon our.

868
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:34,960
The art'll just be a bonus. If you
you wanna still art to make money,

869
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:37,736
Upstairs in the kitchen, that's the
one. I told you.

870
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:41,720
Cezanne. 200 fucking million!
No, you didn't, I told you that.

871
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,160
You were going gaga
about the fucking goblet.

872
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:47,840
Just take it and fuck off. You don't
tell me what to fucking do!

873
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,000
Go and get it.

874
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,040
It's a two-man job.

875
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,800
Then fucking get it, both of you!

876
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,960
They're going to the kitchen.
Right. Righto. Let's go.

877
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:06,720
Ahh! Don't be a clever Dick, Foley.

878
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,240
These girls'll get the blast
before you do.

879
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,360
How do you wanna play this, Jake?

880
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:42,000
Dad, I'm scared! It's OK, baby.
It's gonna be OK.

881
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,800
What's going on? Who is this guy?

882
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:49,056
Where is everyone else?
We are old friends.

883
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:52,160
Aren't we, Jake?
He's Paul's brother.

884
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:55,600
The others are sick. Sick?

885
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:59,280
Sick from what? Poison. Poison?!

886
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:00,920
Jake, what's going on?!

887
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:05,296
Have you ever tried to sell
high-end stolen art, Victor?

888
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:07,560
Whatever that kid's telling you

889
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,360
art collectors,
they like to show off.

890
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,720
Who you gonna sell it to?

891
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:16,200
I'm connected,
I can fence anything.

892
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:18,240
Are you feeling OK?

893
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,720
You don't look so good.

894
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:27,680
Did you touch that glass?

895
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:31,640
Yeah, yeah, I touched the glass.
So... so what?

896
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:35,280
Well,
you might have a problem with that.

897
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:38,560
That's where the poison was...
on the glass.

898
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:43,920
Bullshit, Foley. Why would there be
poisoned on the glass?

899
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,960
I'll let you ask my soon-to-be
ex-wife Nicole here.

900
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,920
She's been having an affair.
I decided to poison her lover.

901
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,000
What have you done?

902
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,680
I don't believe ya. Ask her.

903
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:59,600
Nicole, have you or have you not
been fucking one of my friends?

904
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,400
Where's Alex?

905
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:10,600
Where's Alex?! You can feel the
poison taking hold now, can't you?

906
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:14,080
Right there... I've got a safe,

907
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:18,680
In it is a bunch of cash and what
you'll need to stop the poison.

908
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:25,000
I need it too.

909
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:29,120
OK...
I'm gonna go and open the safe.

910
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,480
One jumps, we all jump.

911
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,320
Oh, boy!

912
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,720
Go, go, go!
What's this? Watch out!

913
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:11,280
Get him! Get him!

914
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,200
Slowly. Slowly.

915
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,000
Got him?

916
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,760
Got him?

917
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:16,360
You think I'm gonna let you have
this, you dumb motherfucker?

918
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,400
I don't give a shit if you die!

919
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,840
Thanks for the money. I win!

920
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:24,800
Enjoy your death from poison,
you shit cunt!

921
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,720
Yargh!

922
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:43,880
So far up your own arse,
aren't you, Foley?

923
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:48,000
You always thought you were better
than anyone else!

924
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:53,880
Well, I'll leave you here
so these women can watch you die!

925
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,600
Dad!

926
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:04,240
'Life's just the game, right?

927
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:07,480
A game of karma, luck and physics.

928
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:11,976
People don't always get to know.

929
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,640
People don't always get to know

930
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:15,680
when the game will finish.'

931
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,880
Are you ready?

932
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,240
'On reflection,

933
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,280
it's been a gift.'

934
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:27,976
Let's go. 'I've never been misguided
in understanding.

935
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,120
Let's go. 'I've never been misguided
in understanding

936
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:33,240
that the way we've created
opportunity for ourselves

937
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:37,720
Hasn't had an effect
in the lives of others.

938
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,320
That's another one of Newton's laws.

939
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,760
I can't change that.

940
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,560
But I can try to rebalance.

941
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:50,720
To that extent, half of my estate
