Gimme.

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Gimme.

5
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,920
Whoo-hoo! Been playing poker?

6
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,976
You Air Force pussy boys
wanna play for cash?

Fuck!

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,976
I can't even deal myself
a good hand.

11
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,840
I can't even deal myself
a good hand.

12
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,640
Bets. I don't have any more.
So, check, then.

13
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,976
Check. OK.

14
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,080
Check. OK.

15
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,160
I'll check too, then.
Show us your cards, Mikey.

16
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,360
Pair of Queens.

17
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,800
Full house. (LAUGHS)

18
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:55,977
Let's just call me moneybags!
Mullah, man!

Let's just call me moneybags!
Mullah, man!

20
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,400
Give it back, man. I need it.

21
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,976
It's not my money. I've gotta pick
my mum's prescription up.

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,136
It's not my money. I've gotta pick
my mum's prescription up.

23
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,200
Shouldn't gamble
if he can't afford to lose it.

24
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,960
Don't be a shit. Just give it back.

25
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,976
You know his mum's sick. You've
still got the rest of the money.

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,456
You know his mum's sick. You've
still got the rest of the money.

27
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,520
OK, I'll give you
your ten bucks back.

28
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,040
If... you jump.

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,760
I can't do that, man.
I-I'm afraid of heights.

30
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,976
And the rocks move. It'll be fine,
bro. Three steps. We checked it out.

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,440
And the rocks move. It'll be fine,
bro. Three steps. We checked it out.

32
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,440
Just give me the fucking money, man!
What fucking money?

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,840
Any money around here belongs to me.
Cough it up.

00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,976
What are you playing, 52 pick up?
Piss off, Victor.

What are you playing, 52 pick up?
Piss off, Victor.

00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,120
Paul, tell your brother Jake won
that money fair and square.

37
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,120
Shut your mouth, septic.
I'll bash you just for fun.

38
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,977
You got any money?

Hey, Mikey? Yeah.
Here's your tenner. For what?

(SHUTTER CLICKS)
I'm at the gallery.

69
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,760
No, no, just dropped something off.
Excuse me?

70
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:19,977
OK? Bye.

71

Yeah. Sorry?

73
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,976
(LAUGHS SOFTLY) No, I'm sorry.
This is gonna sound really odd,

74
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,080
(LAUGHS SOFTLY) No, I'm sorry.
This is gonna sound really odd,

75
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,960
but I wanna thank you. I took these
shots of you in the gallery.

76
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,760
And I really am sorry.

77
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,976
I just saw the way
you were looking at the art.

78
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,560
I just saw the way
you were looking at the art.

79
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,200
There was just something
in the way you were taking it in.

80
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,976
Can I buy you a coffee or something?
Can we talk?

81
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,920
Can I buy you a coffee or something?
Can we talk?

82
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,040
I don't want a coffee.
Do you know what the Archibald is?

83
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,977
It's a portrait prize. Yeah.
Yeah? I wanna paint you for that.

84
00:07:52,001 --> 00:07:54,880
It's a portrait prize. Yeah.
Yeah? I wanna paint you for that.

85
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,480
But, technically, we've gotta
spend a bit of time together.

86
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,976
Thing is, there's a form that needs
to be signed, and I don't have it,

87
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,016
Thing is, there's a form that needs
to be signed, and I don't have it,

88
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,640
but maybe... you could just say,

89
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,976
"Alira Morley has permission
to paint my portrait."

90
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,216
"Alira Morley has permission
to paint my portrait."

91
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,960
You just have to say your name.

92
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,280
The competition's not for six
months, so I've got plenty of time.

93
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,840
Alira Morley has permission
to paint my porch.

94
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,040
OK, I'm gonna go that way. No, not
yet. You gotta say your name.

95
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:23,977
Jake Foley.

96
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:25,560
Jake Foley.

97
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,320
Could you maybe say your age
and what you do? Is that OK?

98
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,680
I'm 57.

99
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,976
And I'm a gambler.

100
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And I'm a gambler.

101
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,120
(LAUGHS SOFTLY) Is that for real?

102
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,440
You're a gambler? Yeah.

103
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:47,977
Like on sports, horses, greyhounds,
that kind of thing?

104
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:50,960
Like on sports, horses, greyhounds,
that kind of thing?

105
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,600
No.

106
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,976
I play poker.

107
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,240
I play poker.

108
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,280
(LAUGHS SOFTLY) Right on!

109
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,520
Well, thanks.

110
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,976
Maybe if I make the shortlist,
I'll see you at the exhibition?

111
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,440
Maybe if I make the shortlist,
I'll see you at the exhibition?

112
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,760
No, you won't.

113
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,400
An object won't change its motion

114
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,976
unless a force acts on it.

115
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,016
Unless a force acts on it.

116
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,240
That's one of Newton's laws.

117
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,976
From the time we were teenagers,
Mikey, Alex. Paul, Drew and I.

118
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,336
From the time we were teenagers,
Mikey, Alex. Paul, Drew and I

119
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,840
were an inseparable band of pirates.

120
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
But for quite a while now,

121
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,977
life and circumstance...
have been pulling us apart.

122
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:38,880
Life and circumstance...
have been pulling us apart.

123
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,880
And time is running out
to apply the force

124
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
that would bring us back together.

125
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,320
Of all the boys,
my best friend was Drew.

126
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,920
We had a lot in common.
Our dad's were Air Force pilots,

127
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:51,977
we liked to take risks, and we both
love card games, specifically poker.

128
00:09:52,001 --> 00:09:57,560
We liked to take risks, and we both
love card games, specifically poker.

129
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,976
Five card draw, seven card stud,
Texas Hold'em, Omaha,

130
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,896
Five card draw, seven card stud,
Texas Hold'em, Omaha,

131
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,680
Razz, Badugi, Chinese,
deuce to seven triple draw,

132
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,720
any kind of poker.

133
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,760
When the first personal computers
came along,

134
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,480
we were all over it, adapting them
to suit us,

135
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,976
writing our own programs
for the games we wanted to play.

136
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,040
Writing our own programs
for the games we wanted to play.

137
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,080
And in '94, we set up the world's
first online poker system.

138
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:23,977
When the larger markets
opened to us...

139
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:26,080
When the larger markets
opened to us

140
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,040
that was a waterfall.

141
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,976
More money
than we'd ever dreamed of.

142
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,440
More money
than we'd ever dreamed of.

143
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,976
Then Drew hit on something else.

144
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,280
Then Drew hit on something else.

145
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,600
By restructuring the code
from cards to countries,

146
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,520
he retooled the program

147
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,976
into a sale able military grade
surveillance software.

148
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,816
Into a sale able military grade
surveillance software.

149
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,160
We called it RIFFLE.
Shit name, I know.

150
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,976
Our customers are governments.

151
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,520
Our customers are governments.

152
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,560
(BIRDSONG)

153
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,240
But life's just a game, right?

154
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,976
It's all in how you read
and respond to your opponents.

155
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,160
It's all in how you read
and respond to your opponents.

156
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,480
You watch how they bet,
how much they bet.

157
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,976
Everything they do informs you more.

(ENGINE REVS / TYRES SCREECH)

790
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,520
We get to Vegas,
we get to the hotel rooms,

791
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:03,000
so I start go ogling...
arse problems.

792
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:03,977
(LAUGHTER) Caution! Caution!
My arse is in danger!

793
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:06,920
(LAUGHTER) Caution! Caution!
My arse is in danger!

794
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,720
Right. Every time
you flinch your sphincter,

795
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,960
it was like an electric shock
through my body.

796
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
We get to this specialist, and I lay
down, and Alex is there with me.

797
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,440
Thank you, Alex. And I lay down,

798
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,976
and he has a look at it.
He's like, "Oh, yep!"

799
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,960
And he has a look at it.
He's like, "Oh, yep!"

800
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,920
"Yeah, you've got
a perianal abscess." Ohh!

801
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,680
It was a terrific weekend in Vegas,
wasn't it, Alex? (LAUGHTER)

805
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,976
Er, hey, I'm driving,

806
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,720
Er, hey, I'm driving,

807
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,760
this is some pretty big stuff.

808
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,320
Just let me pull over and we can
talk properly.

809
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,976
I'm a kid, is that it? I can't
handle reality or something?

about five months ago...

815
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,760
This is really hard.

816
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,976
Your dad had a vasectomy. OK?

817
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,160
Your dad had a vasectomy. OK?

818
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:13,280
"He didn't... He just did it,
he didn't discuss it with me."

819
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:15,977
Now I've always known
that your dad, he...

820
00:48:16,001 --> 00:48:18,560
Now I've always known
that your dad, he

821
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:23,240
he loves you so much. And he didn't
wanna complicate your life

822
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:23,977
"with a half-sibling
when you were younger."

823

"With a half-sibling
when you were younger."

824
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,640
But I always thought that

825
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,720
we would eventually get the chance
to have a baby.

826
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,360
So the vasectomy news

827
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,560
that was, er

828
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,960
I've been in his office

829
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,960

00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,440
It's OK, Bec,

it crisscrosses your cell phones,

Now, I'm not saying
we know everything,

we know everything,

I feel sick!

896
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:19,600
I'm not surprised, Alex.
I poisoned you.

897
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,720
On the base
of your toasting glasses.

898
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,976
It would have got on your hands...
your faces.

It would have got on your hands...
your faces.

Are you serious?!

00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,976
I'm sweating like a motherfucker.

I don't feel too good.
First signs are sweating

909
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,976
loss of balance, nausea, and then...
Then what?

910
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:56,880
Loss of balance, nausea, and then...
Then what?

911
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,920
Stop fucking around.

912
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,960
You want us dead?

913
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,976
I've been diagnosed with an
inoperable pancreatic cancer.

914

I've been diagnosed with an
inoperable pancreatic cancer.

915
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,800
It's a death sentence.

916
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:11,977
So now we're all on the same level.

917
00:53:12,001 --> 00:53:14,320
So now we're all on the same level.

918
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,320
Touch pad. Bring him over.

919
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,240
Beautiful.

920
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:27,360
You've done the job for me.
Jesus! Fuck!

921
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:27,977
What the fuck, Mikey? What was you
gonna do, shoot us? Shoot Jake? Me.

922
00:53:28,001 --> 00:53:32,080
What the fuck, Mikey? What was you
gonna do, shoot us? Shoot Jake? Me.

923
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,800
I was gonna shoot me.

924
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,640
That was the plan.

925
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:43,560
I was gonna say goodbye to you
all and... shoot myself.

926
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:43,977
Is this about the business? You
think, we was gonna let you drown?

927
00:53:44,001 --> 00:53:47,200
Is this about the business? You
think, we was gonna let you drown?

928
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:51,520
Why didn't you reach out? Yeah. I
had no idea you were this unhappy.

929
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:56,040
I put back two bottles of vodka
a day, Alex.

930
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,840
That's not the habit
of a happy person.

931
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,560
I'm all right with death.

932
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,840
I'm not!

933
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:07,977
I have a wife and kids.
I've got people who depend on me.

00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,560
I can't tell you.
What's the code?

938
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,976
You want another one?
What is the fucking code?

You want another one?
What is the fucking code?

01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,760
You want a drink?

1098
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:39,976
Somebody already has.

1099
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Somebody already has.

1100
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,976
Oh. (LAUGHS)

1101
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:12,360
Oh. (LAUGHS)

1102
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,600
Look at this! Nice!

1103
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,240
And this is a fucking
two storeys underground. Boom!

1104
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,976
Nobody's home. Yes, there is.

1105
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,160
Nobody's home. Yes, there is.

1106
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,960
This cigar didn't light itself.

(SNIFFS)

1108
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,720
There's a lot of eye candy in here.

1109
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:35,976
They're hiding somewhere.

1110
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
They're hiding somewhere.

1111
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,960
Billy, check around.

1112
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,720
OK, we got the guns, let's stop
these fuckers. I don't have guns.

1113
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:43,976
You got a panic room, no firearms?

1114
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:44,320
You got a panic room, no firearms?

1115
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:47,320
I've got a panic room
so I don't need firearms.

1116
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:51,040
Victor, they probably
just fucked off. Look around!

1117
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:51,977
OK.

1118
01:03:52,001 --> 01:03:53,960
OK.

1119
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:58,280
Victor.
Victor, look at this room, man!

1120
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,976
Top dollar!
It's like Ali Baba's cave, man!

1121
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,160
Top dollar!
It's like Ali Baba's cave, man!

1122
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,976
What am I looking at?
1889. Melbourne.

1123
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:08,360
What am I looking at?

1124
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,840
9x5 Impression exhibition.

1125
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,840
182 works painted mainly
on cigar box lids.

1126
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,976
They sold for a guinea each,
a couple of bucks.

1127
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:16,720
They sold for a guinea each,
a couple of bucks.

1128
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:20,920
Tom Roberts, Arthur Street on,
Charles Conder.

1129
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,960
You've hit the trifecta!

1130
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:23,977
Now you are looking at three million
at auction, easy.

1131
01:04:24,001 --> 01:04:26,480
Now you are looking at three million
at auction, easy.

1132
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,440
Grey market to us,

1133

(CHUCKLES) Happy days!

1134
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,976
I know you're still here, Jake.

1135
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,240
I know you're still here, Jake.

1136
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,960
Ha! Yes, you fucking are,
aren't you!

1137
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:47,977
Hello, Jake. It's been a while.

1138
01:04:48,001 --> 01:04:49,720
Hello, Jake. It's been a while.

1139
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,640
Aren't you gonna say
hey to an old mate?

1140
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,976
We ain't gonna hurt anyone,
we're just gonna take the art.

1141
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:56,480
We ain't gonna hurt anyone,
we're just gonna take the art.

1142
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,440
Ask the Minister why it's safer
not to call the cops.

1143
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,976
Why the fuck are we on TV?

1144
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:04,440
Why the fuck are we on TV?

1145
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,320
Because our host
is still somewhere in the house.

1146
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:10,000
Check up those stairs.

1147
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,440
What else is in here?

1148
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:19,440
We were just gonna hit this place
in darkness.

1149
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:19,977
Nothing personal. Then Paul said.

1150
01:05:20,001 --> 01:05:22,040
Nothing personal. Then Paul said

1151
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:25,480
you were gonna be here
and I thought, "Fuck it!

1152
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,400
I wanna make it personal!"

1153
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:27,977
A panic room? You can't shoot
a motherfucker with it.

1154
01:05:28,001 --> 01:05:30,360
A panic room? You can't shoot
a motherfucker with it.

1155
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,880
We've got Mike's gun.
It's only got one bullet.

1156
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:35,977
I was planning on killing myself,
you only need one bullet for that.

1157
01:05:36,001 --> 01:05:38,880
I was planning on killing myself,
you only need one bullet for that.

1158
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:42,680
Clarice Beckett. Genius!

1159
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,520
We can move these in a heartbeat.

1160
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,720
Another Street on.

1161
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,976
William Do bell.

1162

1163
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,920
Last sold for 935,000!

1164
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:59,976
John Peter Russell! So rare!
He had hardly ever exhibited.

1165
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,016
John Peter Russell! So rare!
He had hardly ever exhibited.

1166
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,400
Classmate of Lautrec and Van Gogh.

1167
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:08,000
He destroyed 400 of his masterworks
in grief when his wife died.

1168
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,960
This is real fucking money!
How much?

1169
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,240
Even at bargain basement,
we are walking away

1170
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,976
with a couple of million.
(LAUGHS)

1171
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:16,960
With a couple of million.
(LAUGHS)

1172
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,800
You hear that, Jake?

1173
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,760
We know what you've got here!

1174
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,976
Oi. The stairs lead to the kitchen.
I didn't see anyone there.

1175
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:24,360
Oi. The stairs lead to the kitchen.
I didn't see anyone there.

1176
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,040
Just like I haven't seen anyone out
here or in the garage.

1177
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,960
And you know what that is, Victor?
Cos there's no one fucking here.

1178
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,520
Help Styx.

1179
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,400
Let's go!

1180
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,680
Jake, there's six of us and three of
them, we can take 'em.

1181
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:39,976
It's only fucking Victor.

1182
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,160
It's only fucking Victor.

1183
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,200
They've got three shotguns
against one bullet.

1184
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,320
Let's just stay down here
until he fucks off, OK?

1185
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:47,977
The more adrenalized he gets,
the harder that drug's gonna hit.

1186
01:06:48,001 --> 01:06:51,400

So, what's this worth?
A couple of hundred K maybe.

1192
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:19,976
He painted a lot Street on. Even
with a less significant work,

1193
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,376
He painted a lot Street on. Even
with a less significant work,

1194
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,960
he leaves his mark of genius. Look.

1195
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,976
A lot of people believe that these
marks of reflection.

1196
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:28,280
A lot of people believe that these
marks of reflection

1197
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:32,480
are Street on painting a portrait of
himself painting the glass.

1198
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:35,976
You see? It's like a man leaning
over an easel.

1199
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,840
You see? It's like a man leaning
over an easel.

1200
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,160
So, our mate had a green head,
did he?

1201
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,976
I tell ya, there's a really good
painting in the kitchen.

1202
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:44,400
I tell ya, there's a really good
painting in the kitchen.

1203
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:47,160
It's a couple of men playing cards,
one's smoking a pipe,

1204
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:51,120
wearing funny hats. That's the type
of painting I like. You know why?

1205
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:51,977
Hmm? Cos it tells a fucking story.

1206
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:54,720
Hmm? Cos it tells a fucking story.

1207
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,640
A couple of blokes playing poker,

1208
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:59,200
they're on the piss,
they're talking shit.

1209
01:07:59,240 --> 01:07:59,977
I mean,
that's just a fucking goblet.

1210

I mean,
that's just a fucking goblet.

1211
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,960

Who's this, Jake?

1219
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:54,560
Plan's changed. Give me the gun.
There's only one bullet in it, man.

1220
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:55,976
They don't know that. Mikey, we're

(PANTS) Well, this changes things,

Don't get too cocky, Foley, you've
got three shotguns trained on you,

1267
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,976
you can't get all of us!
I'm only aiming at you, Victor.

I may or may not die, depends if you
can shoot really, doesn't it?

1273
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:19,976
And even if you get me, these two
will still shoot you, take your art.

1274
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,416
And even if you get me, these two

1275
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:25,800

No, I won't.

1276
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:27,976
I'm here to steal,
I'm not damaging anyone.

1277

I'll defend your hon our.

Well,
you might have a problem with that.

poisoned on the glass?

I decided to poison her lover.
