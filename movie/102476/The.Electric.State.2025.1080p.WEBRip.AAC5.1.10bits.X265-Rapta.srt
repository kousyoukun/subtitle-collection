1
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:03,333
Stuck, aren't you?

2
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,333
No.

3
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,583
I'm done.

4
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:16,790
That professor said that test
took Einstein three days. Three days!

5
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:18,332
Yeah, then he stole his brain.

6
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,540
You know, it's just embarrassing.
You can't go to college before me.

7
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:24,124
No, Einstein took that test,

8
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,707
became Einstein,
then they stole his brain.

9
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:29,582
Chris, it doesn't matter
'cause you just aced that test.

10
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:31,082
Doesn't mean I <i>have</i> to go here-- Uh.

11
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:34,791
Watch where you're goin', son.

12
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,416
You must think you're real funny.

13
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,207
A robot on your shirt?

14
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:42,624
No, it's a cartoon.
Is that a crime now too?

15
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,999
Join humanity, son! War is coming!

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Sorry.

17
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,915
I don't know
how you're gonna survive college.

18
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:49,957
Yeah, by not going.

19
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,749
What are you talking about?

20
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,332
Well, Mom and Dad would've gone
nuts if I didn't take the test,

21
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:59,666
so I took the test,
and I... I kinda wanted to see how I'd do.

22
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,832
But... I don't know.

23
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:05,208
- You always know.
- I'm not ready.

24
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:06,916
Hey.

25
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:11,457
Your brain is the single
most annoying thing in my life.

26
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:15,290
It's also the most amazing.
You can't just hide that in your room.

27
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:18,665
That professor said
he's never seen scores like yours.

28
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,708
You could change the world.

29
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:24,874
Okay, I... I...
I'd rather do it with you around.

30
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:27,540
Aw!

31
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:30,208
Okay, to buy me pizza and do my laundry.

32
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:34,707
It doesn't matter
if you're down the hall or on the moon,

33
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:35,999
we're always connected.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,916
That's actually theoretically possible.

35
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,915
Quantum physics says
that particles can stay linked

36
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,540
way after they come into contact.

37
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,874
And if everything exists
in a state of electricity,

38
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:51,041
then it's possible our consciousness
could transcend physical boundaries.

39
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:52,708
Cool.

40
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,083
Then my particles
will come visit your particles.

41
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,000
In your dorm.

42

57
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,124
You famously never owned robots, did you?

58
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,415
I never trusted them.

59
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,874
They're not us.

60
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:57,624
So how would they possibly understand

<i>but the day eventually came</i>

68
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,040
<i>when they grew tired

69

00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,415
Postwar Robot Internment Act.

155
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,958
Hey. She said put on your caster.

156
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:42,582
Oh. I'm sorry, I have a condition
where I can only live in reality.

157
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,000
Sucks,
but you go right ahead!

158
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,957
I see you're new here, Michelle,

159
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:51,500
but Neurocasters are mandatory
in grades nine and above.

160
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,041
Tough day.

161
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,582
I wouldn't limit it to today.

162
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,583
Well, maybe I should have a talk
with your mom?

163
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,541
Turn the page.

164
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,207
"Ward of the state."

165
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,333
"Two parents, one brother."

166
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:16,875
Oh.

167
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,208
A lot of kids here lost family in the war.

168
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,166
It wasn't from the bots, actually.

169
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,916
Our car hit a deer.

170
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,083
- In the road.
- I'm sorry.

171
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,583
So was the deer.

172
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,499
You know, neurotherapy
could take some of that weight,

173
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,208
give you a... a few hours to forget.

174
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:48,915
It's okay. It's all right.
We'll fix it when we get back in the car.

175
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:53,916
Hey, look at me.

176
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:55,666
You're okay.

177
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:58,916
Do you feel the sand?

178
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,208
Do you feel the air on your face?

179
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,333
Yeah. Yeah.

180
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,000
Okay. Look at me.

181
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:11,958
You're okay.

182
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,166
- Yeah.
- We're good.

183
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,040
- I know.
- Yeah, we're good.

184
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,125
- We're good.
- We're good.

185
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,333
-We're good.
-Yeah.

186
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,041
Okay?

187
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,000
Okay, come 'ere.

188
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,041
<i>Hey, Michelle.</i>

189
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:34,958
Michelle.

190
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,416
Can I go now?

191
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,000
Dad? Dad!

192
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:28,999
Hello?

193
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,874
Uh-oh!

194
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,708
Ted! Ted!

195
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,916
No, no, no.

196
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,957
Come on. Ted, there's a robot outside!

197
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:04,791
Stay back!

198
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,583
Freeze!

199
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,207
Now, what do you want?

200
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,500
Stay back!

201
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,957
Me?

202
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:17,207
Why?

203
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,540
I don't know what you're saying.
Can you talk?

204
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,083
Stop moving.

205
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,750
Look out. Look out for the rock monster!

206
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:48,333
Jessie. Jessie. Jessie. Jessie.

207
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,875
- There's trouble on the moon.
- Put that back.

208
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,333
- You're my special friend.
- That's me.

209
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,082
No.

210
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,832
We can team up.
We can defeat the rock monster.

211
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,915
- Why are you here?
- We can team up.

212
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,499
- We can team up.
- Put it back.

213
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,707
We can team up.

214
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,457
- We can team up.
- Put it back.

215
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,415
- We can team up.
- Put...

216
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:14,750
We can team up.

217
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,790
-Hey! What was that?
-Oh God.

218
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,457
You gotta get out of here.

219
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,041
You gotta leave now.

220
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,250
You have got to go. Right now!

221
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,375
Is that a bot?!

222
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,165
I tried telling you.
I tried waking you up--

223
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,665
Do you have any idea

224
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,582
what the state would do to me
if they found a frickin' bot in my house?

225
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:38,582
It is not my fault!

226
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,915
It's not my fault either.
Get it the hell outta here!

227
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,540
- That's what I'm trying to do!
- Well, try harder!

228
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:55,125
Hey, robot! You speak the human?
Get the hell outta here.

229
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,083
Put on your jetpack.
It's time to zoom!

230
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:00,457
Listen, brother.

231
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:06,915
You are looking at the captain
of the 1953 Topeka varsity wrestling team.

232
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,083
Ya!

233
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,583
All right.
Now you're gonna get all the pain.

234
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,750
That's what you're gonna get.
All the pain.

235
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,124
Yeah. Come on.

236
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,708
Come on, you little toothy bastard!

237
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,750
No!

238
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,749
You...

239
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:36,915
Attempted murder.

240
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,415
That's what that is!

241
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:43,332
I'm calling the cops on him <i>and</i> you.
You're going to jail, you little shit.

242
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:50,624
I may lose a couple of bucks, but nobody,
<i>nobody</i> shoves Ted Finister around.

243
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:51,540
<i>911.</i>

244
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:56,665
I wanna report a 100%,
I kid you not, robot attack--

245
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,666
Ah!

246
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,082
Oh God.

247
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:08,415
<i>Sir, are you there? Do you wanna report?
Is everything all r--</i>

248
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,832
Put on your jetpack.
It's time to zoom!

249
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,708
Can you do anything about that?

250
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,666
Please don't be a psycho.

251
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:37,458
Whoa. Okay, it's on. Uh...
you wouldn't happen to know how to drive?

252
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,166
No, me either.

253
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,124
Okay, we're going in reverse!

254
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,125
Hey, that's my mother's car!

255
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,583
Stop!

256
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,000
Oh boy!

257
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,375
Stay here.

258
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:36,458
Really?

259
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,916
Oh, dammit, Ted.

260
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,249
Hey.
Hey, come back here.

261
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,458
- Come on. You shouldn't be out here.
- Get word to Cosmo Command!

262
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,250
We're in trouble!

263
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,665
- Hey, listen...
- Come in.

264
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,915
- ...get in the car.
- Come in. Do you read me?

265
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,958
No more catchphrases.
No more Cosmo bullshit.

266
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,875
You died. And now you're here.

267
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,541
How did this happen?

268
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,833
Are you a robot now?

269
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,041
But you're alive.

270
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:30,833
You're out there.
The real you is out there somewhere.

271
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,416
Are you all right?

272
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,208
How do I find you?

273
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:42,125
- Hey, wait.
- Jessie! Jessie!

274
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,625
Better hurry. There's trouble on the Moon!

275
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,207
Sentre?

276
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,541
We can team up!

277
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,291
We can defeat the rock monster!

278
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:58,957
Sentre's all over the world.
Where exactly are you?

279
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,457
The solar system's gone haywire!

280
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,416
Well, is there anyone who does know?

281
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,166
Eyes?

282
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,833
Glasses.

283
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,041
The person who knows where you are
wears glasses?

284
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,790
Well, that really narrows it down,
doesn't it?

285
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,958
Available for a limited time only!

286
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,165
Doctor.

287
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,875
Doctor with glasses.

288
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,125
Michelle.

289
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,208
Michelle.

290
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,166
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

291
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,750
I'm afraid I have bad news.

292
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,458
Your brother Christopher...

293
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,083
he passed this morning.

294
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:03,250
Where is he?

295
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,958
Believe in yourself!

296
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:17,249
- That's the middle of the Exclusion Zone.
- You can do it!

297
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:21,833
The EX is a prison
for robots to not break out of.

298
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,915
How the hell are we supposed to break in?

299
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:27,540
Kid Cosmo thinks you're out of this world!

300
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:38,207
"NEW2U Gifts and Goods,
P.O. Box 1616, Clayton, New Mexico."

301
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,500
This stuff is from the Exclusion Zone,

302
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,083
which means whoever owns this PO box
knows how to get in and out.

303
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:51,915
How far is New Mexico?

304
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:30,457
Come on!

305
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,000
Chris, I wanted to...

306
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,708
Chris. Chris!

307
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:34,832
- What are you doing?
- There's only one chance.

308
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:36,999
We've got to combine our Cosmo modules.

309
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,125
Jessie, the Earth is in danger!

310
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:42,958
There's not... much we can do.

311
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:58,541
Oh shit. Come on! Come on, let's go.

312
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:17,708
<i>♪ Mother ♪</i>

313
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:21,166
<i>♪ Tell your children not to walk my way ♪</i>

314
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:24,790
<i>♪ Tell your children
Not to hear my words ♪</i>

315

Said I'm shocked!

355
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,499

I can't believe that shit worked!

is to go to prison for harborin' a bot.

- You're not harboring me!
- Cops come, I'll pretend I don't know you.

363
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:11,040

You work out of the back of a truck.

421
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:57,874
Did you unplug this

422
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:00,375
and take my extension cord
to your charging station?

423
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,082
- No.
- You're blinking.

424
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:04,582
I can see that you're blinking,
so I know that you're lying.

425
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:07,333
- I'm not lying.
- So you did take it. Now, what I need...

426
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:10,207
is for you to admit it.

427
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:15,040
All relationships are built on trust.
Be honest with me, and I won't get mad.

428
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:16,625
Just tell me that you took it,

and I won't get mad.

430
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:22,915

436
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,332
Unlike you.
You need energy from the outlet.

437
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:40,374
You get the energy from the outlet,
you put the extension cord back. Okay?

438
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,957
-We've been on the road ten days.
-Where do I plug in?

439
00:32:42,958 --> 00:32:46,082
No place to plug in if there's
no power source. What am I supposed to do?

440
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:49,624
You can plug in any time.
You don't have to keep your energy cold.

441
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:53,915

I don't care. It's none of my business.
You can stay here with <i>your</i> bot.

466
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:13,291
- I'll go with my bot.
- No, you're not.

467
00:34:15,416 --> 00:34:18,958
The EX.
Kid, it's not some spring-break hotspot.

468
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:22,165
Only thing you're gonna do
in there is die.

469
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:26,332
So why don't you get back in the elevator
and forget you ever saw this place.

470
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:27,249
Now.

471
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:31,708
Oh boy.

472
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:34,332
What the hell is goin' on?
Do you have friends?

473
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:35,707
Would I be here if I did?

474
00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:38,415
Hey, they followed us.
Maybe someone followed them.

475
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:40,666
Great. All right.

476
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,291
We run Omaha-3, low voltage.

477
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:47,290
- Take the bot with you.
- It's not a bot. It's my brother.

478
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:49,374
Whatever, kid.

479
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:51,957
You want it to live?
You're gonna have to trust me.

480
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,874
-Uh, this is a red alert!
-It's okay.

481
00:34:57,875 --> 00:35:01,874
-Jessie, this is a red alert!
-Come on. We're about to run Omaha. C'mon.

482
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:04,290
Wait. All right.
Take my hand. You're my kid sister.

483
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:07,040
That's our backstory.
Your name is, uh, Veronica.

484
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:08,250
Beronica with a B?

485
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:11,290
Have you ever met anyone
named Beronica with a B?

486
00:35:11,291 --> 00:35:13,415
- Actually, I have.
- Okay. No, it's V... it's V.

487
00:35:13,416 --> 00:35:14,874
- Okay, <i>Veronica.</i>
- Like <i>Veronica</i>.

488
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:16,915
- Last name?
- Know what? Your character is a mute.

489
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:18,708
So stand behind me and shut up.

490
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:40,333
Attention, suspects.

491
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:43,249
This facility
is now under the jurisdiction

492
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,832
of the Robot Deactivation Task Force.

493
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:47,208
Who the hell is that?

494
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:52,083
Consider yourselves detained.

495
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:54,540
Trouble.

496
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:59,041
Now, do me a kindness.

497
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:01,625
Raise those hands.

498
00:36:02,625 --> 00:36:05,166
I'd love to avoid
any unwarranted violence.

499
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,165
Well, I... I would as well.

500
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:12,124
And so would my mute sister here,
uh, Veronica.

501
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:15,290
We can assure you there are receipts
for each of these unique items.

502
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:18,124
- Happy to drum those up for you.
- Michelle Leona Greene.

503
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:22,165
You're under arrest for malicious assault,
grand theft auto, truancy,

504
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:24,041
and abetting an enemy of the state.

505
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:26,040
Holy crap.

506
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:27,666
- I want a lawyer.
- What...

507
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:30,290
You can speak?!

508
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:33,416
Oh, you're gonna get a lawyer.
Where's the bot?

509
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,916
What? Bot?

510
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:37,582
That's crazy.

511
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:40,083
There are bots?

512
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:41,999
Why are you talking?

513
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,249
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

514
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,915
Pardon me
for trying to assist law enforcement.

515
00:36:46,916 --> 00:36:50,040
You know, I really gotta say,
as a taxpaying citizen

516
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,832
who loves flags and line dancing,

517
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:55,082
all of it, big American here,

518
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:57,415
I'm stunned that you would think
I'm harboring robots.

519
00:36:57,416 --> 00:36:59,916
In fact, I... I would go so far as to say

520
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:01,499
I'm shocked.

521
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:16,750
I've got you now.

522
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:36,165
You wanna help yourself,
Miss Greene?

523
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:37,208
Give up the bot.

524
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:39,874
You keep playing this out,

525
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:42,832
come sentencing time,
you'll be old enough for grown-up prison.

526
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:44,375
<i>♪ Take me to the river ♪</i>

527
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,374
You destroyed a 25,000-dollar pistol.

528
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:10,208
-I'll give it to ya for 15.
-Stop!

529
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,208
Don't hurt him.

530
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:19,583
Step away from the bot.

531
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:23,457
What are you gonna do?

532
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:26,957
Miss, I have a job,
and you can't stop it.

533
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:30,625
Now, do yourself a favor
and step away from the bot.

534
00:38:31,791 --> 00:38:33,415
He needs to get back to the EX.

535
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:35,749
You are in violation
of the treaty.

536
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:38,457
-He's marked for deactivation.
-You're heartless.

537
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:41,374
You can't be heartless
to things with no heart.

538
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:50,665
-We gotta move, Lemonhead. Chief!
-Come on.

539
00:38:50,666 --> 00:38:52,915
Okay,
looks like we're goin' to the EX.

540
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:54,665
-We are?
-Get in! Get in! Let's go!

541
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:55,582
Okay.

542
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,583
-Keats, you better not be dead!
-Here we go!

543
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:02,040
-Hang on.
-This is a treaty violation.

544
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:03,040
This is treason!

545
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,915
Okay.

546
00:39:05,916 --> 00:39:08,040
- I told you to color code.
- I know which one it is!

547
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:10,374
-Why do you have so many keys?
-Come on! Come on!

548
00:39:10,375 --> 00:39:13,958
- I'm a very important man.
- You're gonna be very important in jail.

549
00:39:17,416 --> 00:39:18,708
Shall we just run at this point?

550
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:20,666
Ha ha!

551
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,499
Everybody hang on. Here we go.

552
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:35,750
Ow!

553
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:47,125
SOS. This is Kid Cosmo
sending out a distress signal.

554
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:51,375
I got a spot for you
right over my fireplace.

555
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:54,750
Not in my house!

556
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:56,958
Get some!

557
00:39:59,708 --> 00:40:01,457
Nobody's getting deactivated today!

558
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:03,541
You, I'll kill you just for fun.

559
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:08,291
Get off!

560
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,916
Ugh! Damn it.

561
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:16,208
Come on. Come on!

562
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:42,083
This...

563
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:51,625
You see that wall?

564
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,708
If you follow it for about ten years...

565
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:58,916
you'll end up right back here!

566
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,707
No way out. We live here now.

567
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:04,207
Congratulations, kid.

568
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:09,375
Oh crap. That's all we need.

569
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:13,040
You can be brave
in the face of danger!

570
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:14,540
All right. Come on.

571
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:19,541
Oh, yay!

572
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:25,291
What the hell are those?

573
00:41:25,791 --> 00:41:27,457
Scavenger bots.

574
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:30,332
They survive by hot-rodding themselves
with parts of other robots.

575
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:31,832
Robots they've killed.

576
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:34,125
-Human. Human.
-Shit.

577
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:36,415
-Human! Human!
-Hey.

578
00:41:36,416 --> 00:41:41,875
-Keats, shut him up!
-Human! Human! Human! Huma--

579
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:46,665
What do they do with people?

580
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:49,249
I've never stuck around
long enough to find out.

581
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:51,124
You gave me a whole new chance,
haven't you?

582
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:53,207
Now that you've buried my life
under a mountain.

583
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:57,374
Hey. My brother needed me.
I'm not sorry we're here.

584
00:41:57,375 --> 00:42:00,290
You realize your brother
is a Lemonhead robot, right?

585
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:02,665
He's not a robot.
He's a person.

586
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:06,082
Chris is operating Cosmo.
Although Chris doesn't know where he is.

587
00:42:06,083 --> 00:42:08,540
The only person who does
is the doctor who gave him to Sentre.

588
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:10,958
Oh yeah!
And where's this doctor supposed to be?

589
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:12,415
Tabletop Mountain.

590
00:42:12,416 --> 00:42:16,124
Oh, um, what is that?
Herm, 300 miles south?

591
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:19,041
- Hope you got good walking shoes, kid.
- You got a better idea?

592
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:21,666
I'll find one.

593
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,875
Love the confidence. I don't share it,
but I totally love it for you.

594
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:33,166
-Does that van work?
-Depends. You got a motor on ya?

595
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,707
It's time to bulk up, Herm.

596
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:38,124
Hey, you know gettin' bulky
is my thing.

597
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:41,374
Oh! Of course! Hundred percent charged.

598
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:43,375
Good to know someone's eaten today.

599
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:47,916
Here I come to save the day!
Oh yeah, Hermdog!

600
00:42:50,458 --> 00:42:51,583
What the hell is that?

601
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:56,375
The HRM component system.
I've got a body size for every job.

602
00:42:57,041 --> 00:43:00,374
What do you think, Keats, we head north?
We never checked the wall around Moab.

603
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:03,999
Oh, sure. Why not?

604
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,374
As far as beautiful places
to starve to death, Moab's fine!

605
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:10,290
Or you could just whine yourself to death.

606
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:12,540
You know, I want you
to think about this moment

607
00:43:12,541 --> 00:43:15,500
when you're begging me
for drinking water in 24 hours.

608
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:21,082
If Chris and I are right
and if that doctor did have a way in here,

609
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:23,082
- he probably has a way out.
- Unlikely.

610
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:25,791
Which is more than you have,
so I've got a plan.

611
00:43:26,833 --> 00:43:28,165
And you've got a ride.

612
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:29,624
So let's make a deal.

613
00:43:29,625 --> 00:43:31,749
Well, if you think for one second

614
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:34,624
that Herm's gonna put
you two and me in that van

615
00:43:34,625 --> 00:43:36,374
and carry us on his shoulder,

616
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:37,791
you're outta your mind.

617
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:06,624
-Where are your parents anyway?
-None of your business.

618
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:07,916
Eh, got it.

619
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:09,624
Dead.

620
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:11,040
Just as well, I suppose.

621
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:13,957
Are you trying to be a dick,
or it just... just comes naturally to you?

622
00:44:13,958 --> 00:44:15,165
That's naturally him.

623
00:44:15,166 --> 00:44:20,458
It... Obviously, it's sad...
when parents cross over,

624
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,165
but this way, you still get to think
nice things about them.

625
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:27,624
- They never had a chance to let you down.
- They wouldn't let us down.

626
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:30,749
-Kid, kid, kid, and alleged kid.
-Happy birthday!

627
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:33,332
-Everybody lets you down.
-Merry Christmas!

628
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:35,582
Stick around long enough,
I'll let you down.

629
00:44:35,583 --> 00:44:38,082
Well, lucky for you,
we won't be sticking around.

630
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:40,333
Yeah! That's the attitude, huh?

631
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:43,457
What do they say? Make money...

632
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:46,083
...and keep runnin', baby.

633
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:48,625
Live by that motto, kid.

634
00:44:50,166 --> 00:44:51,208
That's what I do.

635
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:55,208
- How'd you two meet?
- We actually met in the war.

636
00:44:55,791 --> 00:44:58,666
-Weren't you supposed to kill each other?
-We tried.

637
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,416
Bots had my whole platoon surrounded,
broke my leg in two.

638
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:06,957
The tin men circled up
to finish off the job.

639
00:45:06,958 --> 00:45:10,915
I look up, I see this big dumb
construction bot peering down at me.

640
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,832
I close my eyes, get ready to die,

641
00:45:12,833 --> 00:45:15,749
and instead, he just lifts me up,
carries me out.

642
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:20,332
-You were cryin' like a baby.
-Ha ha ha! Yeah, right. Not like a baby.

643
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:22,499
You know they don't really know
human emotion.

644
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,749
It was a war cry.
Like, "Yeah! W... Wolverines!"

645
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:30,540
Please. You were sucking your thumb
and begging me to save your ass.

646
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:32,791
He's... he's correct.

647
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,291
A few days later,

648
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:39,874
well, Sentre drones found us,
and I tried to tell 'em,

649
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:44,332
"Hey, this guy saved my life.
Herm's a good guy. Don't shoot."

650
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:46,791
They opened fire anyway.

651
00:45:48,041 --> 00:45:49,875
Tried to kill us both, so we ran.

652
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:52,874
We been runnin' ever since, huh?

653
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,832
Most people would think
it was weird, right?

654
00:45:54,833 --> 00:45:57,290
A robot and a guy gettin' along.
Hangin' out.

655
00:45:57,291 --> 00:45:58,833
At least you have each other.

656
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:02,290
So what are you gonna do
if you find your brother?

657
00:46:02,291 --> 00:46:04,583
I mean, you know, the rest of him.

658
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:06,166
What do you do then?

659
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,166
Whatever we want.

660
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:15,375
What you makin', Mama?

661
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:19,540
It's Sunday.
What do I always make on Sunday?

662
00:46:21,125 --> 00:46:22,582
Stuffed peppers.

663
00:46:22,583 --> 00:46:25,250
What my boy wants, my boy gets.

664
00:46:26,208 --> 00:46:29,874
As long as it's less than a nickel
and on the day-old shelf.

665
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:31,333
You, hush.

666
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:35,458
But, not for nothing, a cannoli.

667
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:38,791
- Day old?
- Two.

668
00:46:39,291 --> 00:46:41,541
Mrs. Vella gave it on the house.

669
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,125
It's good to see you like this, Mama.

670
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:50,958
- Up and around, and...
- Why wouldn't I be?

671
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:53,750
No reason.

672
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:58,290
My <i>angioletto</i>.

673
00:46:58,291 --> 00:47:00,125
Such a funny boy.

674
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,375
Such a funny boy.

675
00:47:03,333 --> 00:47:05,040
Such a funny boy.

676
00:47:10,083 --> 00:47:11,708
Son of a bitch!

677
00:47:23,666 --> 00:47:26,416
<i>The data-transfer rate
is dropping like a rock.</i>

678
00:47:27,916 --> 00:47:28,749
Explain.

679
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:33,332
- Well... he told me it could wait, so--
- Uh, until I had all the facts.

680
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:37,790
The fact is that the service
we provide for the world

681
00:47:37,791 --> 00:47:40,207
is going from utterly flawless

682
00:47:40,208 --> 00:47:43,291
to complete dog shit!

683
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,875
Why?

684
00:47:47,583 --> 00:47:48,999
- Christopher's gone.
- Louder.

685
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,541
Christopher... is... gone.

686
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:56,457
That's physically impossible.

687
00:47:56,458 --> 00:48:00,290
But cerebrally,
n... neurologically, he... he's not there.

688
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:04,499
Are you telling me
that my breakthrough broke out?

689
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:08,790
There was a, uh,
tiny unsecured node in his data matrix.

690
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:10,582
Barely noticeable really.

691
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:14,958
And... over time,
it allowed his consciousness to, um...

692
00:48:16,041 --> 00:48:18,708
uh, well, drip past our firewalls.

693
00:48:19,583 --> 00:48:22,999
It appears that it was constructed
that way d... deliberately.

694
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,832
- It was Amherst.
- Well, it wasn't us, sir.

695
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:28,249
No. Theoretically, if the Neurocaster
data speed keeps dropping...

696
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:30,290
A... and there's no reason
to think it won't.

697
00:48:30,291 --> 00:48:32,415
Sentre is screwed eight ways to Sunday.

698
00:48:32,416 --> 00:48:34,540
-More like Saturday.
-This Saturday?

699
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:38,165
- My company collapses on Saturday?
- Friday, more likely.

700
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:39,916
-Shut up.
-It could be Saturday.

701
00:48:44,958 --> 00:48:45,958
<i>You've got mail!</i>

702
00:49:13,375 --> 00:49:17,250
I... I've... I've... I've always
found the natural world very soothing.

703
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:21,333
You know me?

704
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,707
Who doesn't know
the Butcher of Schenectady?

705
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:27,832
The baddest ass on the Task Force.

706
00:49:27,833 --> 00:49:31,040
I saw your puff piece
on <i>60 Minutes</i> when you retired.

707
00:49:31,041 --> 00:49:32,458
I didn't retire.

708
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:35,041
I just ran out of bots to hunt.

709
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:42,541
I understand that you're hunting
for a juvenile delinquent

710
00:49:43,416 --> 00:49:46,874
and her... mechanical companion.

711
00:49:46,875 --> 00:49:48,957
Task Force calls, I answer.

712
00:49:48,958 --> 00:49:52,166
Hmm. Well, seems that
you and I share a common goal, then.

713
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:57,125
The girl's machine... belongs to Sentre.

714
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:01,665
- I want it back.
- The bot's wanted for assault.

715
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:04,708
- And that's an automatic termination.
- Yeah, but you could delay that.

716
00:50:05,416 --> 00:50:06,832
Once Sentre has what it needs,

717
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:09,166
you can do whatever you want
to whatever is left.

718
00:50:13,666 --> 00:50:14,832
It's a nice spot.

719
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:17,124
- Thank you. Made it myself.
- I know.

720
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:19,582
I saw your puff piece on <i>20/20</i>.

721
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,625
Then, you know

722
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,541
the incredible resources that I have.

723
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,165
Suppose I could get
your drone back online.

724
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:33,582
Why not go get him yourself?
Sentre's got the toys.

725
00:50:33,583 --> 00:50:34,666
Peace accords.

726
00:50:35,291 --> 00:50:37,124
Not allowed to go into the EX

727
00:50:37,125 --> 00:50:40,207
unless there's evidence
that the treaty has been broken.

728
00:50:40,208 --> 00:50:42,166
So are you asking me to get the bot?

729
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:44,374
Or to get you evidence?

730
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:47,500
Let's just see where the day takes us...
shall we?

731
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:07,291
Hey, meat puppets.
Look ahead of you.

732
00:51:07,916 --> 00:51:10,750
Wow! Tabletop Mountain, huh?

733
00:51:11,583 --> 00:51:13,540
That right there is a natural wonder.

734
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:15,999
If you were this doctor,
where would you be?

735
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,124
There's a Martian base
just past the asteroid field.

736
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:20,458
Is that a mall?

737
00:51:22,666 --> 00:51:26,208
Seems to be in pretty good shape.
Guess the Scavs haven't found it yet.

738
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:30,415
There's supplies,
shelter, defensible perimeter.

739
00:51:30,416 --> 00:51:32,291
Not the worst place in the world to hide.

740
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,124
-Think the food court's still open?
-Here we go.

741
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:37,290
We found an old Panda Express in the EX.

742
00:51:37,291 --> 00:51:39,040
All the food was still good.

743
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:43,374
We got fortune cookies,
General Tso's chicken, orange chicken,

744
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:45,749
chicken fried rice, pork fried dumplings.

745
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,833
All that stuff, it just doesn't go bad.

746
00:51:55,375 --> 00:51:56,958
-Uh-oh.
-Look out!

747
00:51:58,666 --> 00:52:01,040
That son of a bitch
threw a fridge at us!

748
00:52:01,041 --> 00:52:04,000
- Herm, get us outta here!
- I'm tryin'!

749
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,665
Incoming!

750
00:52:08,666 --> 00:52:11,541
Ow! Oh, he got me in the hammy! Oh no!

751
00:52:12,125 --> 00:52:14,540
Hold on! Oh no, we're goin' down! No, no!

752
00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:15,708
Ow!

753
00:52:19,416 --> 00:52:22,165
Who throws refriger-- Son of a...

754
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:23,458
Huh?

755
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,999
Ah, shit.

756
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:33,499
Ladies and gentlemen...

757
00:52:34,958 --> 00:52:36,000
...you're captured.

758
00:52:39,875 --> 00:52:43,750
-You ever seen these guys before?
-Dude, we don't all know each other.

759
00:52:45,041 --> 00:52:48,540
Hey, I better not see
one ding on that thing.

760
00:52:48,541 --> 00:52:49,499
Too late.

761
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,750
I must ask you to halt.

762
00:52:51,458 --> 00:52:53,874
- Right there.
- Watch where you're stickin' that thing.

763
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:56,290
Prepare yourselves
to witness the wonderment,

764
00:52:56,291 --> 00:52:58,082
to behold the beguiling,

765
00:52:58,083 --> 00:53:04,333
to perceive the prodigious
prestidigitations of Perplexo.

766
00:53:06,458 --> 00:53:09,749
Spirits of the netherworld, hear me!

767
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:14,125
I command this gate to rise!

768
00:53:20,125 --> 00:53:22,915
We rehearsed this a thousand times.
Come on!

769
00:53:22,916 --> 00:53:26,624
All right, now,
newly awakened spirits of the underworld!

770
00:53:26,625 --> 00:53:29,791
-Unbelievable.
-I command this gate to rise!

771
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:35,291
Are you not amazed?

772
00:53:36,583 --> 00:53:41,041
- Where are you taking us?
- All questions will be answered within.

773
00:53:53,916 --> 00:53:57,249
Here's the plan.
I'm gonna fake a seizure.

774
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:58,540
You get to the roof.

775
00:53:58,541 --> 00:54:02,832
- I'm not leaving until I find that doctor.
- Hey, you want some juice?

776
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:05,540
-Don't talk to strangers!
-Come on.

777
00:54:05,541 --> 00:54:09,832
Well, here if you need me.

778
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:18,458
Oh me, oh my! Taco, humans.

779
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:23,708
Oh my God.

780
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:26,291
This is crazy.

781
00:54:34,958 --> 00:54:37,665
Ah, jeez, people.
Where the heck did they come from?

782
00:54:37,666 --> 00:54:40,833
-They're prisoners.
-It's a Kid Cosmo bot.

783
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:42,708
They're not human!

784
00:54:44,333 --> 00:54:46,166
Hey. Hey.

785
00:54:57,333 --> 00:55:00,540
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to bring a very special guest

786
00:55:00,541 --> 00:55:01,957
onto our stage tonight.

787
00:55:01,958 --> 00:55:03,582
A personage so august,

788
00:55:03,583 --> 00:55:05,790
a leader so towering,

789
00:55:05,791 --> 00:55:09,625
he goes only by the awe-inspiring title of

790
00:55:10,208 --> 00:55:12,708
Mr. Peanut!

791
00:55:13,208 --> 00:55:14,541
No way.

792
00:55:15,041 --> 00:55:16,540
Cut the guff, P.

793
00:55:16,541 --> 00:55:19,416
You know I don't care
for all that hyperbole.

794
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:25,166
Afternoon. I'd... I'd tip my hat,
but, uh, well, it's bolted on.

795
00:55:25,666 --> 00:55:29,124
We took you down
because we thought you were Scavs.

796
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:32,540
- Excuse me?
- See, they come round every now and again.

797
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:35,540
Just lookin' to rip us limb from limb.

798
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:38,540
Y'all don't really look like limb-rippers,

799
00:55:38,541 --> 00:55:40,749
but, you know, looks can be deceivin'.

800
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:42,499
We need to talk to you, sir.

801
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,832
Yeah, humans always want
somethin' from us.

802
00:55:44,833 --> 00:55:46,874
Kinda like stink on a skunk.

803
00:55:46,875 --> 00:55:48,583
We're looking for a doctor.

804
00:55:49,541 --> 00:55:51,916
With... glasses.

805
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:57,000
Mmm, well, walk with me, will ya?

806
00:55:58,291 --> 00:56:02,749
Stupid question, I know,
but... what exactly is this place?

807
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:07,125
Well, uh, we haven't put up
the sign yet, but try this on for size.

808
00:56:07,666 --> 00:56:12,957
"Blue Sky Acres,
an oasis of safety in an uncaring desert."

809
00:56:12,958 --> 00:56:14,124
Pretty catchy.

810
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:17,915
You're lookin' at the cradle
of a new mechanized civilization.

811
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,332
- Hey, Mr. Peanut.
- How do, Blitz?

812
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:21,665
Ralphie, slow down!

813
00:56:21,666 --> 00:56:28,040
At Blue Sky Acres, robots can evolve past
the job descriptions humans stuck on them.

814
00:56:28,041 --> 00:56:31,082
- They can pick up a new trade.
- Hair!

815
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:34,415
- Maybe even find their true selves.
- Hair!

816
00:56:34,416 --> 00:56:35,457
Uh-uh. Like, whoa.

817
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:38,165
Mrs. Scissors,
we don't do that anymore.

818
00:56:38,166 --> 00:56:40,749
-Hair.
-Leave the man alone, please.

819
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:42,999
Oh!

820
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,499
Sir. Mr... Peanut. We need your help.

821
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:49,374
I'm sure you do, but the actual fact is

822
00:56:49,375 --> 00:56:52,540
your presence here
provides legal justification

823
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:56,499
for Sentre to wipe out
everything these robots have built.

824
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:00,707
Best I can do is escort you
ten miles into the desert

825
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:02,375
and leave you on your lonesome.

826
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:05,375
I mean, after chow, of course.

827
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:09,749
Free as a bird!
Now, I hope you brought your appetite.

828
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:12,374
I did. I never got my burrito.

829
00:57:12,375 --> 00:57:14,874
Hey, read the room. It's a burger joint.

830
00:57:14,875 --> 00:57:18,540
All right, well... I'll have a cheeseburger.

831
00:57:18,541 --> 00:57:20,124
Oh, sorry. We're outta cheese.

832
00:57:20,125 --> 00:57:22,249
That... that's fine. Burger and fries.

833
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,624
Well, more bad news. We're outta that too.

834
00:57:24,625 --> 00:57:26,707
What do you have?

835
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:28,624
I'mma break it down to you for real.

836
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:31,124
Ain't nobody ate up in here
in a long time.

837
00:57:31,125 --> 00:57:33,290
If it was good, it's bad now.

838
00:57:33,291 --> 00:57:35,958
We got spaghetti.
We got canned beans on a Twinkie.

839
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,583
What kind of beans?

840
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:45,499
So your brother has no idea
where his actual human body is?

841
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:46,749
All he knows is Sentre.

842
00:57:48,416 --> 00:57:53,165
Hmm! Why in the hell
would Sentre steal a little boy?

843
00:57:53,166 --> 00:57:54,625
I know. It's nuts.

844
00:57:56,875 --> 00:57:59,124
- No offense.
- Get it all the time.

845
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:02,375
Chris said the doctor that took him
would be here at Tabletop.

846
00:58:03,166 --> 00:58:04,000
Okay.

847
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:07,165
Might as well tell you the truth.

848
00:58:07,166 --> 00:58:09,041
There was a doctor here.

849
00:58:09,708 --> 00:58:11,207
-Here we go!
-What did you say?

850
00:58:11,208 --> 00:58:16,207
Dr. Clark Amherst,
PhD in Human-Machine Interaction.

851
00:58:16,208 --> 00:58:17,415
Well, where is he now?

852
00:58:17,416 --> 00:58:19,749
Obviously,
I gave him the boot.

853
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:21,082
At least he's consistent.

854
00:58:21,083 --> 00:58:23,915
You don't know any other way outta here,
and the one person who did,

855
00:58:23,916 --> 00:58:26,165
you sent him off in the wilderness to die?

856
00:58:26,166 --> 00:58:27,457
Damn right I did.

857
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:33,041
I signed that peace treaty
because it recognized robots as a people.

858
00:58:33,875 --> 00:58:36,124
I don't guess you'd know what it's like

859
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:39,166
to have your very right to exist
depend on a piece of paper.

860
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:42,250
All this, it's fragile, man,

861
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:45,665
and there was no way
I was gonna let that doctor threaten it

862
00:58:45,666 --> 00:58:47,082
any more than I'll let you.

863
00:58:47,083 --> 00:58:49,499
Dr. Amherst is a kidnapper.

864
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:53,165
This is the little boy he took.
You gonna treat those two people the same?

865
00:58:53,166 --> 00:58:56,832
But all humans <i>are</i> the same.
Selfish and lazy.

866
00:58:56,833 --> 00:59:00,665
Once you figure that out, little girl,
you'll live a much simpler life.

867
00:59:00,666 --> 00:59:01,708
Come on.

868
00:59:02,708 --> 00:59:03,541
Young lady?

869
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:07,457
I would not advise you
to go out there at night.

870
00:59:07,458 --> 00:59:09,499
I really don't care
about what you would advise.

871
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,415
Think you're building
something special here?

872
00:59:11,416 --> 00:59:13,333
You're just like everyone out there.

873
00:59:14,791 --> 00:59:15,791
Thanks for the ride.

874
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,040
Bon appétit.

875
00:59:22,041 --> 00:59:22,999
Keats.

876
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,499
-What?
-Really?

877
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,500
- I gotta eat.
- This is lame, man. Even for you.

878
00:59:32,416 --> 00:59:35,165
- Where you goin'?
- There are cars in the parking lot.

879
00:59:35,166 --> 00:59:38,040
I'll get one
and drive until I find the doctor.

880
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:40,249
Come on,
it's 100,000 square miles out there.

881
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:44,040
- Chances of finding them are pretty slim.
- Chances of finding him in here are zero.

882
00:59:44,041 --> 00:59:47,082
The chances of not dyin' in here
are pretty high.

883
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,957
You can't go out in the EX after dark.

884
00:59:48,958 --> 00:59:51,249
I mean, listen,
you're just gonna have to trust me.

885
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:55,125
Hey. For real.
Your sister's no good to you dead.

886
00:59:57,791 --> 00:59:59,000
Look at that face.

887
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:03,249
How can you deny
that weird robot-head face?

888
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:04,500
Hang out!

889
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,332
Go to Orange Julius.

890
01:00:06,333 --> 01:00:08,333
It's a mall. Steal some shit.

891
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:10,708
Leave in the mornin'.

892
01:00:14,166 --> 01:00:15,000
Fine.

893
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:18,333
We'll get killed in the morning.

894
01:00:22,791 --> 01:00:25,750
- Ah, hair!
- Touch my hair, and I'll kill you.

895
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:28,916
-Ah, hair.
-He could use a haircut.

896
01:00:45,458 --> 01:00:47,290
<i>That should just about do it, Beemo.</i>

897
01:00:47,291 --> 01:00:50,625
<i>-Hot dog, Cosmo. With these upgrades...</i>
<i>-Hi, stranger!</i>

898
01:00:51,333 --> 01:00:53,582
- Merry Christmas!
- Where've <i>you</i> been?

899
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:56,499
<i>-There's trouble on the moon!</i>
-Lisa Stewart had a party.

900
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:59,540
- Mom said you were at the library.
- I'm pretty sure that's what I told her.

901
01:00:59,541 --> 01:01:00,666
You have any fun "reading"?

902
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:02,707
Better than here.

903
01:01:02,708 --> 01:01:04,124
Ever since you left,

904
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:07,541
if Mom and Dad aren't yelling
at each other, they're yelling at me.

905
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:12,249
- Good thing I'm moving home, then.
- Shut up. I'll be fine.

906
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:15,457
That's super debatable,
but I wouldn't be doing it for you.

907
01:01:15,458 --> 01:01:18,290
- What, you graduate early or something?
- Not exactly.

908
01:01:18,291 --> 01:01:20,915
My professor shows me off
like I'm some sort of prized monkey,

909
01:01:20,916 --> 01:01:24,208
but he never listens to my ideas,
then I get back to my dorm,

910
01:01:24,791 --> 01:01:29,833
and my roommate calls me Doogie Howser
and pees in my garbage can.

911
01:01:30,708 --> 01:01:32,874
I'm moving home.

912
01:01:32,875 --> 01:01:36,166
You do that,
and <i>I'll</i> pee in your garbage can.

913
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:41,000
Remember when I said
you were gonna change the world?

914
01:01:41,625 --> 01:01:42,707
I do.

915
01:01:42,708 --> 01:01:45,457
- Have you done that yet?
- Not exactly.

916
01:01:45,458 --> 01:01:48,250
Then, I suggest
you get your ass back to college.

917
01:01:54,458 --> 01:01:56,082
After Christmas.

918
01:01:56,083 --> 01:01:57,666
<i>Cosmo modules, unite!</i>

919
01:02:00,458 --> 01:02:04,124
Bet if Cosmo went to college,
Jessie would visit him all the time.

920
01:02:04,125 --> 01:02:06,791
How dare you?

921
01:02:07,541 --> 01:02:08,832
Jessie has a jetpack.

922
01:02:08,833 --> 01:02:11,416
- Okay, I'll build <i>you</i> a jetpack.
- Fine.

923
01:02:11,916 --> 01:02:13,625
Deal. I'd love a jetpack.

924
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:19,040
<i>- Thanks for coming, Cosmo.</i>
- I missed you, dude.

925
01:02:19,041 --> 01:02:20,874
<i>Always remember,
Kid Cosmo's your pal.</i>

926
01:02:20,875 --> 01:02:22,041
I missed you too.

927
01:02:43,583 --> 01:02:45,833
<i>I better hurry.
There's trouble on the moon!</i>

928
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:50,416
<i>That's no way to treat a friend.</i>

929
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:54,125
<i>Hey, Webby, no snacking between meals!</i>

930
01:03:04,083 --> 01:03:06,124
<i>You can if you believe you can!</i>

931
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:12,250
<i>Next time, try a sandwich!</i>

932
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:16,832
<i>Thanks for coming, Cosmo.</i>

933
01:03:16,833 --> 01:03:19,166
<i>Always remember,
Kid Cosmo's your pal.</i>

934
01:03:26,833 --> 01:03:29,041
Uh, hi. Hello?

935
01:03:31,958 --> 01:03:33,499
- Ding-dong!
- Did you hear that?

936
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:34,874
Oh, hi!

937
01:03:34,875 --> 01:03:36,458
Huh?!

938
01:03:37,041 --> 01:03:40,666
I'm not even supposed to be here.
Um, we should be really quiet.

939
01:03:41,166 --> 01:03:44,040
I'm looking for a "Christopher Greene"?

940
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:45,749
Double asteroid!

941
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:47,458
I've got some mail for you.

942
01:03:48,541 --> 01:03:50,790
Oh God, Herm, I got the Twinkie sweats.

943
01:03:50,791 --> 01:03:55,207
Just before Mr. Peanut sent him away,
Dr. Amherst gave me that letter,

944
01:03:55,208 --> 01:03:58,374
and he said to deliver it to Christopher
if he ever showed up.

945
01:03:58,375 --> 01:04:00,540
Oh, and that there...
there's no signature required.

946
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:02,874
"Christopher, if you find this, find me."

947
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:05,165
"2201 Pinnacle Peak Road."

948
01:04:05,166 --> 01:04:06,540
"I will wait. Clark."

949
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:09,207
I guess I already
broke the rules by taking it from him.

950
01:04:09,208 --> 01:04:11,999
I don't know where I'm at with this.
Guess there's no use crying over--

951
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,915
- How can I get to this place?
- Well, I know where it is. It's not that.

952
01:04:14,916 --> 01:04:17,249
It's that if I help you,
I'm gonna get in even more trouble

953
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:21,040
than I'd already probably get in,
and it makes me feel really bad to say it,

954
01:04:21,041 --> 01:04:23,082
but I... I can't tell you.

955
01:04:23,083 --> 01:04:25,582
But I do know. I do know.
It's not that I don't know.

956
01:04:25,583 --> 01:04:30,207
Look, if that's the doctor... that might be
able to get us the hell outta here,

957
01:04:30,208 --> 01:04:36,207
then could be your terrible idea is...
slightly less terrible.

958
01:04:36,208 --> 01:04:37,374
We can get you there.

959
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:40,957
Keats, that's Scav territory.
You know we're gonna need muscle.

960
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:44,332
Muscles are antiquated and unreliable.

961
01:04:44,333 --> 01:04:48,708
Oh, he heard us. We were too loud.
I was too loud! It was me. I was loud.

962
01:04:49,291 --> 01:04:53,541
A pneumatic piston, on the other hand,
that's a quality component.

963
01:04:54,166 --> 01:04:57,207
And a baseball bat,
well, that'll get 'er done.

964
01:04:57,208 --> 01:05:01,290
- Meaning what?
- The treaty doesn't allow you to stay.

965
01:05:01,291 --> 01:05:03,749
That doesn't mean I can't help you leave.

966
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:05,540
I thought we were the enemy.

967
01:05:05,541 --> 01:05:09,415
Could be the human factory
made some good models after all.

968
01:05:09,416 --> 01:05:10,415
Thank you.

969
01:05:10,416 --> 01:05:12,291
Well, I was talkin' to her.

970
01:05:13,166 --> 01:05:18,333
Now, if we're headin' into Scav country,
there's a fella you're gonna wanna meet.

971
01:05:24,375 --> 01:05:27,250
Would you like to hear
a funny story about Scavs?

972
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,790
Oh yeah! I love to laugh.

973
01:05:29,791 --> 01:05:32,207
I once saw a Scav hunting party

974
01:05:32,208 --> 01:05:36,790
attack and dismember
ten of my closest friends

975
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:37,874
in front of my eyes!

976
01:05:37,875 --> 01:05:39,999
How is that funny?

977
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,332
Nothing left...

978
01:05:41,333 --> 01:05:43,125
...but oil stains.

979
01:05:44,666 --> 01:05:45,583
Oh... Uh...

980
01:05:48,583 --> 01:05:50,665
Oil stains and screws!

981
01:05:50,666 --> 01:05:54,540
A Scav is a walkin', talkin' chop shop

982
01:05:54,541 --> 01:06:00,165
who wants to eat you whole
and poop you out... <i>raw.</i>

983
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:04,790
I've beaten dozens of Scavs to a pulp
with this very bat.

984
01:06:04,791 --> 01:06:07,166
Even then, they kept comin'.

985
01:06:08,166 --> 01:06:10,499
That's the funny thing
about Scavs...

986
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:14,916
...they'll not stop until you're dead.
All right, then!

987
01:06:16,041 --> 01:06:18,666
Tighten your guts and loosen your nuts.

988
01:06:19,541 --> 01:06:22,124
We've got Scavs... ...to kill.

989
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:23,624
-Oh. Pop?
-Oh boy.

990
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:25,874
Is he gonna fall asleep
in the middle of combat?

991
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:28,457
I... feel as though
that might be a liability.

992
01:06:28,458 --> 01:06:30,332
Oh! Huh-hoh!

993
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:32,708
That was a brushback.

994
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:52,707
Fly, Cyril, fly!

995
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:54,207
Ooh!

996
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,125
Oh, are we sure this is it?

997
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:32,749
There are 160 million
addresses in the continental US,

998
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:35,458
and every single one
is hard-burned into my circuits.

999
01:07:35,958 --> 01:07:38,957
If Dr. Amherst said
he was at 2201 Pinnacle Peak,

1000
01:07:38,958 --> 01:07:40,415
then this is where he is!

1001
01:07:40,416 --> 01:07:43,708
If you were a package,
this is exactly where I'd drop ya.

1002
01:07:45,916 --> 01:07:47,250
Lay ya down right here!

1003
01:07:48,208 --> 01:07:49,416
Then I would run away.

1004
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:51,999
I don't like it.

1005
01:07:53,541 --> 01:07:56,416
This place is a Scav buffet.

1006
01:07:57,083 --> 01:07:59,249
-I wouldn't...
-Where you goin'?

1007
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:00,958
- ...climb on anything, I...
- Hey.

1008
01:08:01,583 --> 01:08:05,833
-I guess I wouldn't, but...
-Hey.

1009
01:08:08,708 --> 01:08:09,875
Someone's here.

1010
01:08:12,208 --> 01:08:13,208
Could be him.

1011
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:29,750
What's the call, Pops?

1012
01:08:30,833 --> 01:08:32,749
Leg it out!

1013
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:38,875
Scav!

1014
01:08:45,791 --> 01:08:46,875
Uh-oh!

1015
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:50,624
-No!
-Hang onto your mail.

1016
01:08:50,625 --> 01:08:53,124
Thank you so much.
I appreciate the teamwork.

1017
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:56,290
Stay calm. Right, stay calm.

1018
01:08:56,291 --> 01:08:58,040
Scavs are still machines.

1019
01:08:58,041 --> 01:08:59,540
They're rational.

1020
01:09:00,583 --> 01:09:03,374
- Open those damn doors!
- These aren't real doors.

1021
01:09:04,416 --> 01:09:06,416
Well, I don't think
we're gonna make it.

1022
01:09:11,333 --> 01:09:12,291
Okay.

1023
01:09:13,041 --> 01:09:14,540
Out of here!

1024
01:09:14,541 --> 01:09:16,374
Quick, everybody,
get behind Penny!

1025
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:17,291
That feels personal.

1026
01:09:26,666 --> 01:09:28,082
Oh no!

1027
01:09:28,083 --> 01:09:29,707
No!

1028
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:32,290
<i>♪ Sweet sensation ♪</i>

1029
01:09:32,291 --> 01:09:34,875
<i>♪ It's such a good vibration... ♪</i>

1030
01:09:36,791 --> 01:09:39,415
I am not dying
to Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch!

1031
01:09:39,416 --> 01:09:40,957
I actually like this song.

1032
01:09:40,958 --> 01:09:43,249
-Whoa.
-Whoa!

1033
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:53,458
<i>Welcome, subjects,
to Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory.</i>

1034
01:09:53,958 --> 01:09:57,041
<i>I hope you enjoyed your ride.</i>

1035
01:09:59,375 --> 01:10:04,958
<i>Kindly step all the way inside
and make room for everyone.</i>

1036
01:10:06,333 --> 01:10:12,207
<i>Too late to turn back now.</i>

1037
01:10:26,625 --> 01:10:27,583
It worked.

1038
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:30,790
Remember me, Doctor?

1039
01:10:30,791 --> 01:10:32,415
Where is my brother?

1040
01:10:32,416 --> 01:10:34,125
- I can't.
- I think you can.

1041
01:10:37,208 --> 01:10:38,040
Ow!

1042
01:10:38,041 --> 01:10:39,125
Answer her question, doc.

1043
01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:44,500
- Seattle. Sentre's island campus.
- Why did you take him?

1044
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:46,833
People were dying.

1045
01:10:47,666 --> 01:10:49,499
We were losing the war.

1046
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,040
Until we found him.

1047
01:10:51,041 --> 01:10:52,582
<i>After your accident,</i>

1048
01:10:52,583 --> 01:10:56,374
<i>a Sentre imaging machine
alerted us to Christopher.</i>

1049
01:10:56,375 --> 01:10:58,374
<i>He was special, okay?</i>

1050
01:10:58,375 --> 01:11:03,041
He was exactly what we needed.
Christopher was like...

1051
01:11:04,291 --> 01:11:06,208
He was like a gift from God.

1052
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:10,333
You held my hand,

1053
01:11:11,625 --> 01:11:12,875
and you lied to me.

1054
01:11:14,666 --> 01:11:16,707
Please. You need to understand.

1055
01:11:16,708 --> 01:11:18,625
Don't tell me what I need.

1056
01:11:19,958 --> 01:11:23,833
Don't tell me about the damn war
and gifts from God.

1057
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:28,000
Just tell me what you did with my brother.

1058
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,291
Will you join us, please?

1059
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,582
-Herm, Herm, Herm!
-Oh my God.

1060
01:11:44,583 --> 01:11:46,999
Whoa, whoa. Hey, pal,
you been creepin' on us the whole time?

1061
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,374
If by "creeping,"
you mean responsibly avoiding the threat

1062
01:11:50,375 --> 01:11:52,290
of monitor burn-in, then yes!

1063
01:11:52,291 --> 01:11:55,624
Why the heck
does this bot speak with your voice?

1064
01:11:55,625 --> 01:11:58,290
Dr. Amherst rescued me
from the Scavengers.

1065
01:11:58,291 --> 01:12:00,375
My voice module had been torn out.

1066
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,083
I recorded PC a vocabulary
of over 100,000 words.

1067
01:12:05,458 --> 01:12:07,625
He's my hard drive and friend.

1068
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:09,791
He knows what I know.

1069
01:12:10,708 --> 01:12:12,040
Show them 17-9.

1070
01:12:12,041 --> 01:12:13,458
Yes, Doctor.

1071
01:12:15,708 --> 01:12:18,541
<i>Blueprint Trial Nine. Test Subject Alpha.</i>

1072
01:12:19,125 --> 01:12:21,750
Christopher was comatose.
We thought it was permanent.

1073
01:12:23,416 --> 01:12:26,124
We looked at it like... organ donation.

1074
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:27,915
Damn, it's like human Scavs.

1075
01:12:27,916 --> 01:12:31,875
We needed an impossible amount
of computing power to run the network.

1076
01:12:32,541 --> 01:12:34,790
Your brother's mind
was the breakthrough Skate needed

1077
01:12:34,791 --> 01:12:37,332
to link the Neurocasters and the drones.

1078
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:40,290
<i>Congratulations, doc.
I think you just won us the war.</i>

1079
01:12:40,291 --> 01:12:41,749
You're disgusting.

1080
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:46,082
If we didn't do what we did,
Christopher would've died in the hospital.

1081
01:12:46,083 --> 01:12:47,624
We saved his life.

1082
01:12:47,625 --> 01:12:50,500
- That's not your choice.
- So you would've pulled the plug?

1083
01:12:52,541 --> 01:12:53,541
If I had to.

1084
01:12:54,208 --> 01:12:56,458
Then you would've been as wrong as I was.

1085
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:00,041
23-6.

1086
01:13:01,541 --> 01:13:03,166
Thirteen months later...

1087
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:25,916
Oh my God.

1088
01:13:29,583 --> 01:13:31,207
Oh, I can't look.

1089
01:13:31,208 --> 01:13:32,291
<i>Shut it down.</i>

1090
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:36,083
I told Skate we had to disconnect him.

1091
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,666
Skate threatened to kill me.

1092
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:42,415
There was no way
I could get Chris out of Sentre.

1093
01:13:42,416 --> 01:13:44,166
So, before I ran,

1094
01:13:44,875 --> 01:13:48,499
I established a tiny connection
between Chris and the outside network.

1095
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,208
His mind could escape

1096
01:13:51,208 --> 01:13:52,540
even if his body couldn't.

1097
01:13:52,541 --> 01:13:54,540
You told him to head to Blue Sky.

1098
01:13:54,541 --> 01:13:58,415
I heard about what you were building,
so I implanted the location in his mind.

1099
01:13:58,416 --> 01:13:59,333
Why?

1100
01:14:01,416 --> 01:14:03,332
I wanted him to find a family.

1101
01:14:03,333 --> 01:14:05,582
-He already had a family!
-Hey.

1102
01:14:05,583 --> 01:14:06,500
Relax.

1103
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,415
Everybody, relax.

1104
01:14:10,541 --> 01:14:13,415
-Oh!
-Hurts more when they're relaxed.

1105
01:14:13,416 --> 01:14:14,624
That was unexpected.

1106
01:14:14,625 --> 01:14:15,750
I saw it comin'.

1107
01:14:16,791 --> 01:14:19,165
- We're gonna go get Chris.
- You can't do that.

1108
01:14:19,166 --> 01:14:21,249
Yes, I can.

1109
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:24,040
- And you're gonna help.
- It's not possible.

1110
01:14:24,041 --> 01:14:27,374
You got into the EX,
which means you can get us out.

1111
01:14:27,375 --> 01:14:29,583
-You have no idea the s--
-Guys?

1112
01:14:31,833 --> 01:14:33,333
Not this asshole again.

1113
01:14:34,833 --> 01:14:38,499
- Who is that?
- The Butcher of Schenectady.

1114
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:40,499
Oh! Oh.

1115
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,083
We have to act quickly.

1116
01:15:02,625 --> 01:15:04,416
<i>This one of yours, Skate?</i>

1117
01:15:06,583 --> 01:15:08,041
Not anymore.

1118
01:15:31,333 --> 01:15:33,457
Well, if it isn't the king of misfit toys.

1119
01:15:33,458 --> 01:15:34,916
No kings here.

1120
01:15:37,708 --> 01:15:39,125
Our people are free.

1121
01:15:40,208 --> 01:15:42,291
Your people ain't people.

1122
01:15:49,041 --> 01:15:50,791
I'm gonna crack that shell.

1123
01:15:52,208 --> 01:15:55,832
Who's got the keys to the peanut?

1124
01:15:55,833 --> 01:15:57,874
The peanut has the keys to his peanut.

1125
01:15:57,875 --> 01:16:01,082
Hold... hold up. Hold on, quiet.

1126
01:16:01,083 --> 01:16:03,125
-What?
-You hear that?

1127
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:08,290
I don't hear anything.

1128
01:16:09,625 --> 01:16:11,041
There it is.

1129
01:16:11,916 --> 01:16:14,083
Hide your brother. Now.

1130
01:16:15,333 --> 01:16:16,290
Come on.

1131
01:16:18,708 --> 01:16:21,333
- Get ready.
- Get ready for... for what now?

1132
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:29,540
Drop your weapons. Hand over the bot.

1133
01:16:29,541 --> 01:16:31,915
I don't really take orders anymore.

1134
01:16:31,916 --> 01:16:34,457
Failure to comply-- Jesus!

1135
01:16:34,458 --> 01:16:38,458
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo!

1136
01:16:39,375 --> 01:16:41,832
- Oh, he did <i>not</i> comply.
- Let's play ball!

1137
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:44,791
Ha ha!

1138
01:16:45,375 --> 01:16:48,374
-Sir, they're attacking.
-Then, attack back!

1139
01:16:48,375 --> 01:16:50,500
Find the target. Find it!

1140
01:16:52,333 --> 01:16:53,750
Everyone else is collateral.

1141
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,290
Come out now,
or you'll be deactivated.

1142
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:06,291
All right, you asked for it!

1143
01:17:15,208 --> 01:17:17,082
-Great work, Jessie!
-Come on.

1144
01:17:17,083 --> 01:17:18,624
-You did it!
-C'mon, let's go.

1145
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:19,957
-Uh-oh!
-End of the line.

1146
01:17:19,958 --> 01:17:21,457
Hey.

1147
01:17:24,958 --> 01:17:26,500
Come on. I know a way out.

1148
01:17:33,833 --> 01:17:34,666
Yeah.

1149
01:17:35,666 --> 01:17:38,250
What in the hell
does the US Postal Service need that for?

1150
01:17:39,166 --> 01:17:39,999
It's for Dobermans.

1151
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,082
Dobermans?!

1152
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:47,499
Ah, ah, ah. No.

1153
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,583
You broke the treaty, Mr. Peanut.

1154
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:51,875
That means consequences.

1155
01:17:57,750 --> 01:18:01,333
A lesson your tin friends at the mall
should be learning right about now.

1156
01:18:04,833 --> 01:18:08,624
You go back and tell the ones who are left
this is your fault.

1157
01:18:23,625 --> 01:18:26,208
Oh no. Hide.

1158
01:18:27,416 --> 01:18:28,291
Come on.

1159
01:18:31,416 --> 01:18:34,250
All right, Miss Greene.
No need for anyone to get hurt.

1160
01:18:34,916 --> 01:18:36,041
Let's call it a night.

1161
01:18:43,791 --> 01:18:45,333
You really want me to keep doin' this?

1162
01:18:48,458 --> 01:18:51,250
You take Christopher and run. Got it?

1163
01:18:59,291 --> 01:19:00,625
Last chance.

1164
01:19:08,666 --> 01:19:09,708
Leave them alone!

1165
01:19:11,875 --> 01:19:14,333
You really think you're gonna win
a gunfight against me, Doctor?

1166
01:19:19,875 --> 01:19:20,708
No.

1167
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:23,458
Good. Now put it on the ground.

1168
01:19:27,083 --> 01:19:29,124
You're not allowed
to kill living things, are you?

1169
01:19:29,125 --> 01:19:31,958
That's right. I put metal down.

1170
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
If you want 'em...

1171
01:19:39,041 --> 01:19:40,208
you'll have to kill me.

1172
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,291
Goddamn it, Skate.

1173
01:19:47,625 --> 01:19:48,832
I had him handled.

1174
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:51,250
Dr. Amherst was in violation
of the treaty.

1175
01:19:52,333 --> 01:19:54,208
Now, get me the bot.

1176
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:16,791
Hold it right there.

1177
01:20:19,583 --> 01:20:20,833
No!

1178
01:20:22,416 --> 01:20:23,541
No!

1179
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,375
Go home, Miss Greene.

1180
01:20:36,041 --> 01:20:37,000
Go home.

1181
01:20:45,583 --> 01:20:46,875
Where they goin'?

1182
01:21:04,791 --> 01:21:09,166
Oh no. Oh no, no, no.

1183
01:21:41,541 --> 01:21:42,416
Hair?

1184
01:21:53,666 --> 01:21:55,791
I'm so sorry, my friend.

1185
01:22:39,166 --> 01:22:40,541
Welcome back, Christopher.

1186
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:46,708
I'm not gonna lie.

1187
01:22:47,291 --> 01:22:49,458
You had me worried there
for a little while.

1188
01:22:50,583 --> 01:22:51,958
It's okay. I'm not mad.

1189
01:22:53,208 --> 01:22:56,083
I understand. Scary stuff, the future.

1190
01:22:56,916 --> 01:22:58,958
Especially when it's all in your hands.

1191
01:23:01,125 --> 01:23:01,958
Don't worry.

1192
01:23:07,416 --> 01:23:08,625
You're not alone.

1193
01:23:12,375 --> 01:23:14,541
That was very touching,
Mr. Skate.

1194
01:23:15,375 --> 01:23:16,375
Just one thing.

1195
01:23:17,583 --> 01:23:18,499
You're a murderer.

1196
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:19,457
Debatable.

1197
01:23:19,458 --> 01:23:21,500
And you lied to me.

1198
01:23:22,375 --> 01:23:23,290
That's not a bot.

1199
01:23:23,291 --> 01:23:25,415
His name is Christopher Greene.

1200
01:23:25,416 --> 01:23:27,625
You had me hunt a boy.

1201
01:23:28,416 --> 01:23:33,041
Look, Colonel Bradbury,
or Butcher... if I may.

1202
01:23:33,625 --> 01:23:34,750
How shall I put this?

1203
01:23:35,791 --> 01:23:36,625
Who cares?

1204
01:23:37,333 --> 01:23:38,166
Who cares?

1205
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,374
That war that you won,

1206
01:23:40,375 --> 01:23:42,790
<i>your impeccable kill record,
that wasn't you.</i>

1207
01:23:42,791 --> 01:23:45,625
That was me and this boy.

1208
01:23:46,333 --> 01:23:47,833
You're just a witness to history.

1209
01:23:48,541 --> 01:23:50,124
This is history?

1210
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:52,625
What? You'd prefer evolution?

1211
01:23:53,666 --> 01:23:58,166
Our world is a tire fire
floating on an ocean of piss.

1212
01:23:58,833 --> 01:23:59,665
Always has been.

1213
01:23:59,666 --> 01:24:05,458
Christopher gives humanity the chance
to leave all that suffering behind.

1214
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:10,332
In my experience, suffering and life
kinda go hand in hand.

1215
01:24:10,333 --> 01:24:11,499
Mine too.

1216
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,665
My mother was a three-bottle-a-day drunk.

1217
01:24:13,666 --> 01:24:15,499
When she tied one on, she was mean.

1218
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:17,708
When she was sober, she was worse.

1219
01:24:18,291 --> 01:24:24,041
But in here,
she's all soft hugs and... stuffed peppers.

1220
01:24:25,541 --> 01:24:26,416
And peace.

1221
01:24:30,166 --> 01:24:33,999
I wanna bring that peace
to every single person on Earth.

1222
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,832
Give or take a few.

1223
01:24:35,833 --> 01:24:40,208
It requires sacrifice
to move a species forward.

1224
01:24:41,041 --> 01:24:42,457
How did it go before?

1225
01:24:42,458 --> 01:24:44,375
Oh, right. Father.

1226
01:24:45,208 --> 01:24:46,041
Son.

1227
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:48,541
Holy Ghost.

1228
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:55,999
There's a chance
that you might not be right in the head.

1229
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,083
Again, who cares?

1230
01:24:58,625 --> 01:24:59,458
Okay.

1231
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:03,416
Let's get Christopher
back where he belongs.

1232
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,083
And maybe just lock the door this time?

1233
01:25:25,375 --> 01:25:28,875
If you really want that thing,
you could probably just break the glass.

1234
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,708
I'm not sure anybody'd notice.

1235
01:25:33,750 --> 01:25:34,832
You got a job interview?

1236
01:25:34,833 --> 01:25:36,375
Oh. Yeah.

1237
01:25:37,458 --> 01:25:39,625
Freakin' robot guilt-tripped me into...

1238
01:25:41,666 --> 01:25:42,500
I hate it.

1239
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:00,875
He was all I had.

1240
01:26:02,958 --> 01:26:04,208
And I lost him twice.

1241
01:26:06,916 --> 01:26:08,208
So go for three.

1242
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:14,458
Your brother's not the only special one
from your family, kid.

1243
01:26:16,375 --> 01:26:19,249
Look, I quit fightin'
because the war was wrong,

1244
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:21,125
but I, you know, I gave up on everything.

1245
01:26:21,791 --> 01:26:25,208
Really I quit... life
because the world sucked.

1246
01:26:26,583 --> 01:26:27,416
And it still does.

1247
01:26:29,208 --> 01:26:31,125
But there are some good people in it.

1248
01:26:32,333 --> 01:26:35,041
And some of 'em wouldn't know
how to quit even if you paid 'em.

1249
01:26:36,541 --> 01:26:39,333
So you wanna go get your brother back?
I'll go with ya.

1250
01:26:41,041 --> 01:26:43,416
You got me. You got Herm.

1251
01:26:44,625 --> 01:26:46,458
Pretty sure we're not the only ones.

1252
01:26:48,583 --> 01:26:50,416
When did you stop being an asshole?

1253
01:26:51,416 --> 01:26:53,416
No, I didn't. I just got a haircut.

1254
01:27:13,791 --> 01:27:15,041
Excuse me, PC.

1255
01:27:16,625 --> 01:27:19,000
Dr. Amherst said
you were his hard drive, right?

1256
01:27:19,583 --> 01:27:21,665
Yes. I knew everything he knew.

1257
01:27:21,666 --> 01:27:24,499
You wouldn't happen to have
the security codes to get us outta the EX?

1258
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:26,082
Yes. I do.

1259
01:27:26,083 --> 01:27:28,499
What about the building that
they're holding Christopher in?

1260
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:30,750
- Could you get me in there?
- Of course I can.

1261
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,375
- I'm going to Seattle.
- <i>We're</i> going to Seattle.

1262
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,499
Herm, remember the big rigs
broken down on the interstate?

1263
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:39,290
- Think you could hot-wire 'em?
- Hell yeah.

1264
01:27:39,291 --> 01:27:41,457
And I could stuff 'em with an HRM 60.

1265
01:27:41,458 --> 01:27:42,957
That 60'd be good in a fight.

1266
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:46,290
I'm sorry,
but you cannot free Christopher.

1267
01:27:46,291 --> 01:27:47,624
Why not?

1268
01:27:47,625 --> 01:27:51,000
If you disconnect him from the mainframe,
all of Sentre will collapse.

1269
01:27:52,416 --> 01:27:54,750
What do you mean Sentre would collapse?

1270
01:27:55,875 --> 01:27:58,540
Sentre's network
runs through your brother's brain.

1271
01:27:58,541 --> 01:28:01,375
Without it, none of the drones will work.

1272
01:28:01,875 --> 01:28:04,708
His removal would cause
a complete system failure.

1273
01:28:06,791 --> 01:28:07,625
Holy shit.

1274
01:28:12,208 --> 01:28:13,916
If we all went to Sentre together...

1275
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:18,832
we could shut them down permanently.

1276
01:28:18,833 --> 01:28:20,415
Oh, I like the way she thinks.

1277
01:28:20,416 --> 01:28:21,707
Jumpin' Joe Morgan!

1278
01:28:21,708 --> 01:28:24,125
-It's a damn double play.
-Hey.

1279
01:28:25,041 --> 01:28:27,041
What are you asking us to do here?

1280
01:28:27,625 --> 01:28:28,708
Fight some more?

1281
01:28:29,625 --> 01:28:31,916
Fighting wasn't the dream.

1282
01:28:32,416 --> 01:28:33,624
Peace was.

1283
01:28:33,625 --> 01:28:36,333
I think Sentre changed that
when they burnt this place to the ground.

1284
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,832
Separating yourself
from the world doesn't work.

1285
01:28:39,833 --> 01:28:41,166
Trust me, I know.

1286
01:28:41,666 --> 01:28:46,791
We have a chance... to tear
their whole sick system down together.

1287
01:28:48,250 --> 01:28:50,916
Bots... and humans

1288
01:28:52,083 --> 01:28:53,707
fighting against the real enemy.

1289
01:28:53,708 --> 01:28:55,582
They beat us before.

1290
01:28:55,583 --> 01:28:57,041
Because they had Chris.

1291
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:02,000
Get me to him... and they won't.

1292
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:05,624
Seattle is 1,230 miles away,

1293
01:29:05,625 --> 01:29:09,082
which is not that far to go for freedom.

1294
01:29:09,083 --> 01:29:13,040
"Take me out to the ball game.
Take me out to the crowd."

1295
01:29:13,041 --> 01:29:15,249
"Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack."

1296
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:18,374
"I don't care if I never get back!"

1297
01:29:18,375 --> 01:29:20,124
We might never get back.

1298
01:29:20,125 --> 01:29:21,583
It's time, Peanut.

1299
01:29:22,666 --> 01:29:25,208
Metal and meat, together.

1300
01:29:27,125 --> 01:29:28,833
You guys are relentless.

1301
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:34,665
Hell, I guess I'd better go get my hat.

1302
01:29:34,666 --> 01:29:36,457
Taco, hit it.

1303
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:24,415
<i>Network capacity is 100%.</i>

1304
01:30:24,416 --> 01:30:27,000
And... we're back.

1305
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:53,165
Suck on this!

1306
01:30:53,166 --> 01:30:55,791
<i>♪ Breaking the law, breaking the law ♪</i>

1307
01:30:56,458 --> 01:30:58,833
<i>♪ Breaking the law, breaking the law... ♪</i>

1308
01:30:59,416 --> 01:31:02,040
Security, we've a situation
in the executive parking lot.

1309
01:31:02,041 --> 01:31:05,958
- You think they noticed?
- I don't know. Do the red one.

1310
01:31:12,125 --> 01:31:14,375
Oh, these Porsches
can really go, baby!

1311
01:31:17,541 --> 01:31:20,874
- Ah, shanked it.
- It stuck? It frickin' stuck?!

1312
01:31:22,333 --> 01:31:26,291
<i>Mr. Skate, we appear
to be under some kind of attack.</i>

1313
01:31:33,666 --> 01:31:35,041
That's very impressive.

1314
01:31:35,625 --> 01:31:36,874
You've made a friend.

1315
01:31:36,875 --> 01:31:39,875
That's a 60-foot HRM
heavy construction bot.

1316
01:31:40,791 --> 01:31:42,666
Nothin' friendly about it.

1317
01:31:44,041 --> 01:31:47,290
Full security response.
I want this put down now.

1318
01:31:47,291 --> 01:31:50,707
<i>Emergency.
All drones report to the north entrance.</i>

1319
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,583
<i>Emergency. All drones report
to the north entrance.</i>

1320
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:03,416
Showtime, kid.

1321
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,916
All right. Let's go. Come on.

1322
01:32:14,916 --> 01:32:17,416
Let's boogie, guys.

1323
01:32:26,125 --> 01:32:28,124
-Hup! They're followin' us!
-Yeah, they are!

1324
01:32:28,125 --> 01:32:31,332
-Was this your stupid idea or mine?
-If it works, it was my idea.

1325
01:32:41,791 --> 01:32:43,541
Come on!

1326
01:32:53,458 --> 01:32:54,500
Herm, look out!

1327
01:32:55,416 --> 01:32:56,791
Argh!

1328
01:32:58,458 --> 01:32:59,291
Jump!

1329
01:33:04,291 --> 01:33:05,124
Herm!

1330
01:33:05,125 --> 01:33:06,041
Herm!

1331
01:33:12,291 --> 01:33:14,999
Hey, I lost a big body,
but I'm still bigger than you.

1332
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,457
Shut up and keep runnin'.

1333
01:33:26,916 --> 01:33:28,291
They are gone.

1334
01:33:29,166 --> 01:33:31,125
You look bigger from the outside.

1335
01:33:31,791 --> 01:33:33,832
Blow it, Herm! Second shift!

1336
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:46,708
Heads up, meat boys!

1337
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:52,500
I got you, my dude! Hold on!

1338
01:34:00,708 --> 01:34:02,958
Bots, show 'em your metal!

1339
01:34:05,083 --> 01:34:06,040
Let's go!

1340
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:09,000
Bots forever!

1341
01:34:09,708 --> 01:34:10,708
Eighty-six!

1342
01:34:12,416 --> 01:34:13,416
You're out!

1343
01:34:14,916 --> 01:34:15,832
Bullseye!

1344
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:21,541
Charge!

1345
01:34:27,291 --> 01:34:29,415
Ha ha!

1346
01:34:29,416 --> 01:34:33,040
He... could... go... all... the... way!

1347
01:34:35,416 --> 01:34:37,500
Tallyho!

1348
01:34:47,083 --> 01:34:50,124
-Keep going. I'll be in Wep-Dev.
-Yes, sir.

1349
01:34:50,125 --> 01:34:53,249
-What are you gonna do?
-What I always do.

1350
01:34:53,250 --> 01:34:54,791
Win.

1351
01:35:07,791 --> 01:35:09,999
<i>The building is on
full security lockdown.</i>

1352
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,916
<i>Repeat, the building is on
full security lockdown.</i>

1353
01:35:21,541 --> 01:35:23,041
You think you could take 'em?

1354
01:35:23,541 --> 01:35:24,416
No.

1355
01:35:30,916 --> 01:35:33,375
Must kill humans!

1356
01:35:34,125 --> 01:35:35,749
Death to humans!

1357
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:38,833
You all must die!

1358
01:35:43,833 --> 01:35:44,874
Argh!

1359
01:35:44,875 --> 01:35:46,750
Waargh!

1360
01:35:52,625 --> 01:35:54,625
We are locked in.

1361
01:35:56,458 --> 01:35:57,625
Is he alive?

1362
01:35:58,500 --> 01:35:59,333
Yes.

1363
01:36:00,583 --> 01:36:02,041
Can I talk to him?

1364
01:36:03,041 --> 01:36:03,875
No.

1365
01:36:04,458 --> 01:36:08,791
The only way to reach your brother
is from inside.

1366
01:36:11,625 --> 01:36:12,625
Inside what?

1367
01:36:13,291 --> 01:36:14,625
His mind.

1368
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:32,374
<i>Order up!</i>

1369
01:36:32,375 --> 01:36:33,458
Savages.

1370
01:36:35,958 --> 01:36:37,708
Oh, it's on now.

1371
01:36:38,583 --> 01:36:40,624
Herm, we might actually win this thing!

1372
01:36:45,333 --> 01:36:49,000
Aha. Oh--

1373
01:36:49,583 --> 01:36:54,583
Guys, uh, they made a... a big one.

1374
01:36:55,166 --> 01:36:56,916
No, like, a really big one.

1375
01:36:57,833 --> 01:36:59,957
I'm afraid you're on private property.

1376
01:36:59,958 --> 01:37:02,749
Well, as an employee
of the United States Postal Service,

1377
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:04,540
I have access to this property.

1378
01:37:04,541 --> 01:37:06,540
Play, Taco. Now! Play!

1379
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,416
Whoa. No!

1380
01:37:13,041 --> 01:37:14,500
No!

1381
01:37:17,541 --> 01:37:20,290
Stop!

1382
01:37:40,333 --> 01:37:41,332
No, Skate!

1383
01:37:42,458 --> 01:37:43,583
Ow!

1384
01:37:46,375 --> 01:37:47,875
You can't beat them.

1385
01:37:48,375 --> 01:37:50,165
No reason not to try.

1386
01:37:50,166 --> 01:37:52,499
Even after what they did to you
at the mall?

1387
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,875
All those bots down,
you're still fightin'?

1388
01:37:55,458 --> 01:37:56,499
How come?

1389
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:58,958
Freedom's worth any cost.

1390
01:37:59,833 --> 01:38:00,957
Even dyin'?

1391
01:38:02,625 --> 01:38:05,666
We'd have to be alive to die.

1392
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:07,333
Yeah.

1393
01:38:08,166 --> 01:38:09,666
Yeah, you would, wouldn't ya?

1394
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,375
Skate's on Level 4.

1395
01:38:15,916 --> 01:38:16,916
Weapons Development.

1396
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:18,916
Why are you tellin' me this?

1397
01:38:19,958 --> 01:38:21,000
Because...

1398
01:38:22,583 --> 01:38:27,000
I finally met someone
less human than a robot.

1399
01:39:54,958 --> 01:39:55,916
Michelle?

1400
01:39:57,333 --> 01:39:58,500
How did you get here?

1401
01:40:00,375 --> 01:40:01,749
I... I thought we lost.

1402
01:40:01,750 --> 01:40:03,708
- Come on. Let's get you out.
- Wait.

1403
01:40:04,833 --> 01:40:05,750
Not yet.

1404
01:40:06,708 --> 01:40:10,165
Chris, I'm kind of in the middle
of committing, like, 20 crimes right now.

1405
01:40:10,166 --> 01:40:14,125
I've been thinking about it
ever since Skate hooked me back up.

1406
01:40:18,416 --> 01:40:19,707
It's all my fault.

1407
01:40:19,708 --> 01:40:22,332
He kidnapped you.
None of this is your fault.

1408
01:40:22,333 --> 01:40:24,707
Out there with you, I saw the world,

1409
01:40:24,708 --> 01:40:29,832
and I saw every evil thing
Sentre is doing to people.

1410
01:40:29,833 --> 01:40:33,000
- And it's all happening because of me.
- Well, we'll stop them.

1411
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,665
Well, we'll take them down.
If we get you out.

1412
01:40:36,666 --> 01:40:37,875
There's no out.

1413
01:40:41,208 --> 01:40:44,582
When they took me back to the lab,
I saw the real me for the first time,

1414
01:40:44,583 --> 01:40:46,791
and you must have too.

1415
01:40:47,916 --> 01:40:48,875
Be honest.

1416
01:40:49,666 --> 01:40:50,875
How do I look?

1417
01:40:52,666 --> 01:40:57,165
My physical connection to Sentre,
it's... it's symbiotic.

1418
01:40:57,166 --> 01:40:59,666
Without me... they die.

1419
01:41:01,583 --> 01:41:02,458
And without them...

1420
01:41:04,125 --> 01:41:04,958
Yeah.

1421
01:41:09,833 --> 01:41:12,458
So what do you expect me to do?
Just... just leave you here?

1422
01:41:13,541 --> 01:41:14,416
No.

1423
01:41:15,958 --> 01:41:20,166
Sentre can keep me alive like this
for a hundred years.

1424
01:41:24,041 --> 01:41:24,875
I think...

1425
01:41:30,416 --> 01:41:31,750
I think I need to die.

1426
01:41:34,291 --> 01:41:36,457
And I think you have to be
the one to do it.

1427
01:41:41,166 --> 01:41:43,791
You want some?

1428
01:41:45,291 --> 01:41:46,666
You bastard!

1429
01:41:47,333 --> 01:41:49,082
Get him, Herm! Here.

1430
01:41:49,083 --> 01:41:52,832
Hey, get me in position!
In position, Herm, get me in position!

1431
01:41:52,833 --> 01:41:53,791
Gah!

1432
01:41:55,791 --> 01:41:57,874
-Argh!
-Ow!

1433
01:42:00,875 --> 01:42:02,208
Ugh!

1434
01:42:04,250 --> 01:42:06,499
<i>Mr. Skate,
the central lab has been breached,</i>

1435
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:08,624
<i>and there are intruders in the building.</i>

1436
01:42:08,625 --> 01:42:10,958
-Take him out.
-Affirmative, sir.

1437
01:42:11,458 --> 01:42:12,832
Keats, get up!

1438
01:42:12,833 --> 01:42:15,458
Aaaargh!

1439
01:42:22,416 --> 01:42:23,458
Howdy do, Ethan.

1440
01:42:24,750 --> 01:42:27,707
Look, I don't know, um,

1441
01:42:27,708 --> 01:42:31,250
what you think you're trying to
achieve here, Mr... Nut.

1442
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:34,750
I'm here to renegotiate the treaty.

1443
01:42:41,041 --> 01:42:44,540
Come on! Come out here
and fight me like a man!

1444
01:42:44,541 --> 01:42:47,165
You want some of me, come and get me!

1445
01:42:47,166 --> 01:42:50,790
- Okay, Herm. All right. Herm!
- Don't send a drone to do a man's...

1446
01:42:50,791 --> 01:42:52,958
-Think you got 'im.
-...job!

1447
01:42:54,458 --> 01:42:57,375
Thing is, he might've got me too.

1448
01:42:58,583 --> 01:43:00,791
You got a big hole
in your guts here, buddy.

1449
01:43:01,833 --> 01:43:05,665
- I'm gonna power save for a... a little bit.
- Oh no. Hang on.

1450
01:43:05,666 --> 01:43:07,083
Ow! Ow!

1451
01:43:07,583 --> 01:43:10,499
How the hell
are you still alive?

1452
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:13,541
How am I still alive?
I'm alive because of you, you bastard.

1453
01:43:15,958 --> 01:43:17,500
You're damn right.

1454
01:43:23,166 --> 01:43:24,124
<i>Michelle?</i>

1455
01:43:24,125 --> 01:43:25,874
I'm so sorry to interrupt,

1456
01:43:25,875 --> 01:43:29,457
<i>but our friends
are in a lot of trouble out there.</i>

1457
01:43:29,458 --> 01:43:32,374
- I'm working on it.
- Uh, we may be running out of time.

1458
01:43:32,375 --> 01:43:33,333
He's right.

1459
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:37,207
- I'm not pulling your plug.
- You said you would if you had to.

1460
01:43:37,208 --> 01:43:40,665
I <i>don't</i> have to. We'll find another robot.
You can use that.

1461
01:43:40,666 --> 01:43:42,583
They locked me in tight this time.

1462
01:43:43,875 --> 01:43:47,291
- There's no choice here.
- There's always a choice.

1463
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:52,416
Everybody told me to move on,
but I couldn't.

1464
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:54,915
You were all I had.

1465
01:43:54,916 --> 01:43:56,207
I held onto you.

1466
01:43:56,208 --> 01:43:57,290
And it worked.

1467
01:43:57,291 --> 01:43:58,832
I got you back.

1468
01:43:58,833 --> 01:44:00,290
That's why this is okay.

1469
01:44:00,291 --> 01:44:01,208
No.

1470
01:44:01,791 --> 01:44:03,416
None of this is okay.

1471
01:44:04,458 --> 01:44:08,166
I haven't felt anything in three years.

1472
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:13,333
But out there with you,
I felt everything, and it was awesome.

1473
01:44:14,708 --> 01:44:15,916
And you gave me that.

1474
01:44:18,708 --> 01:44:19,791
If that's all I get,

1475
01:44:21,041 --> 01:44:23,791
it... it's enough.

1476
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:28,416
Michelle, we are running out of time.

1477
01:44:30,083 --> 01:44:32,291
Oh, I can't. I can't.

1478
01:44:44,208 --> 01:44:46,208
I don't wanna lose you all over again.

1479
01:44:47,541 --> 01:44:48,791
You can't lose me.

1480
01:44:49,458 --> 01:44:51,041
<i>Michelle, can you hear me?</i>

1481
01:44:52,166 --> 01:44:53,375
<i>Please answer me.</i>

1482
01:44:55,041 --> 01:44:56,375
But you <i>can</i> lose them.

1483
01:44:59,458 --> 01:45:03,000
You. You're the one
who's gonna change the world.

1484
01:45:04,333 --> 01:45:06,166
You know,
I never got to say goodbye to you.

1485
01:45:07,666 --> 01:45:08,916
You never have to.

1486
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,041
I love you.

1487
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:18,458
I love you too.

1488
01:47:06,083 --> 01:47:08,416
Oh no, no, no!

1489
01:47:09,083 --> 01:47:10,165
No!

1490
01:47:10,166 --> 01:47:12,291
Seems like the day is ours.

1491
01:47:13,250 --> 01:47:14,749
We won!

1492
01:47:14,750 --> 01:47:15,916
Yeah!

1493
01:47:17,041 --> 01:47:18,249
<i>We</i> won!

1494
01:47:18,250 --> 01:47:19,166
No!

1495
01:47:21,041 --> 01:47:22,875
-Hey, Penny!
-We did it.

1496
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:24,333
Woo-hoo!

1497
01:47:26,166 --> 01:47:27,166
We won, Pops.

1498
01:47:27,708 --> 01:47:29,208
Funny thing about winning.

1499
01:47:29,750 --> 01:47:32,125
Someone always loses.

1500
01:47:39,625 --> 01:47:40,625
She did it, Herm.

1501
01:47:43,625 --> 01:47:45,041
Can you believe it? We won.

1502
01:48:00,833 --> 01:48:02,582
What am I supposed to do without ya, huh?

1503
01:48:02,583 --> 01:48:05,666
What am I gonna do
without my best friend?

1504
01:48:08,208 --> 01:48:09,708
I love you, Herm.

1505
01:48:11,125 --> 01:48:12,415
I love you.

1506
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:13,541
I mean, really.

1507
01:48:15,958 --> 01:48:17,375
Maybe more than a friend.

1508
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:20,582
You make me smile.
You used to make me smile.

1509
01:48:20,583 --> 01:48:23,875
Now what am I supposed to do?
Just go back to being a... what?

1510
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:27,791
Get the band back together?
Those guys are all married.

1511
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:31,875
I ain't got no friends now, Herm.

1512
01:48:41,583 --> 01:48:44,457
Hey, beefcake. You miss me?

1513
01:48:44,458 --> 01:48:49,790
What... What is this?!

1514
01:48:49,791 --> 01:48:52,457
Oh, it's the eight-inch model
for detail work.

1515
01:48:52,458 --> 01:48:55,124
Detail? I... You... I never...
I've never seen this!

1516
01:48:55,125 --> 01:48:58,916
I've never seen your eight-inch model,
and I imagine I'm being generous.

1517
01:48:59,541 --> 01:49:00,375
Wait...

1518
01:49:01,458 --> 01:49:02,582
You said you were dyin'.

1519
01:49:02,583 --> 01:49:06,082
No, I said I had to sleep
to save power for the transfer.

1520
01:49:06,083 --> 01:49:08,540
Not my fault you got all emotional
and told your truth.

1521
01:49:08,541 --> 01:49:11,207
Emotional?!

1522
01:49:11,208 --> 01:49:14,749
By the way, I didn't catch everything
you were sayin' out here.

1523
01:49:14,750 --> 01:49:16,915
Uh, would you mind repeatin' some of it?

1524
01:49:16,916 --> 01:49:18,832
I... I said we won.

1525
01:49:18,833 --> 01:49:21,958
I said we won! What...
Look around, we won. She did it.

1526
01:49:22,541 --> 01:49:25,290
That's not what I heard.
I heard, "I love you."

1527
01:49:25,291 --> 01:49:27,916
- I heard, "More than a friend."
- I don't think I said that.

1528
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:30,040
Holy shit, did we win?

1529
01:49:30,041 --> 01:49:31,500
-Oh yeah.
-Where's the girl?

1530
01:49:32,833 --> 01:49:34,750
Let's go see. Come on.

1531
01:49:35,333 --> 01:49:36,375
So what now?

1532
01:49:39,125 --> 01:49:40,333
Do I die?

1533
01:49:43,166 --> 01:49:44,166
No.

1534
01:49:46,583 --> 01:49:48,083
<i>We</i> live.

1535
01:49:57,125 --> 01:49:59,124
<i>The entire city
is shut down.</i>

1536
01:49:59,125 --> 01:50:02,415
<i>The entire state,
the country is at a standstill.</i>

1537
01:50:02,416 --> 01:50:04,332
<i>Chaos reigns
in New York City today</i>

1538
01:50:04,333 --> 01:50:07,332
<i>as all Sentre drones have gone offline.</i>

1539
01:50:07,333 --> 01:50:10,040
<i>Flights are grounded
across the globe. Traffic control is...</i>

1540
01:50:10,041 --> 01:50:13,290
<i>Radio silence from Sentre
as millions of panicked users</i>

1541
01:50:13,291 --> 01:50:16,457
<i>wait for any word, any sign,
of how to get back online.</i>

1542
01:50:16,458 --> 01:50:20,207
<i>Explosive accusations today
as a videotape was released</i>

1543
01:50:20,208 --> 01:50:24,583
<i>purporting to show
Sentre's experimentation on a human child.</i>

1544
01:50:25,291 --> 01:50:27,915
<i>Congress is readying subpoenas
for Sentre executives...</i>

1545
01:50:27,916 --> 01:50:31,874
<i>Ethan Skate was arrested in
Miami trying to board a plane to Ecuador.</i>

<i>Protestors are calling for the end
of the Robot Exclusion Zone...</i>

1547
01:50:35,875 --> 01:50:38,415
<i>Ethan Skate is a sicko!</i>

1548
01:50:38,416 --> 01:50:41,124
<i>Lock him up, throw away the key,
sell your stock!</i>

1549
01:50:41,125 --> 01:50:43,415
<i>I don't wanna waste another word
on this guy.</i>

1550
01:50:43,416 --> 01:50:45,332
<i>But you know who I wanna talk about?</i>

1551
01:50:45,333 --> 01:50:49,290
<i>The girl who trucked a ton of bots
to Seattle to kick Skate's butt.</i>

1552
01:50:49,291 --> 01:50:51,290
<i>Absolutely right.
We should find that kid...</i>

1553
01:50:51,291 --> 01:50:54,875
<i>Who is she?
Somebody please tell me who this kid is.</i>

1554
01:51:00,458 --> 01:51:02,583
Herm says he got the camera
up and runnin'.

1555
01:51:03,375 --> 01:51:04,208
Okay.

1556
01:51:06,375 --> 01:51:07,958
Are you sure you wanna do this?

1557
01:51:11,583 --> 01:51:13,916
- Gotta connect those particles.
- Mm.

1558
01:51:16,083 --> 01:51:18,000
Mm-hmm. I don't know what that means.

1559
01:51:20,583 --> 01:51:22,291
<i>Give 'em hell, kid. You got this.</i>

1560
01:51:24,166 --> 01:51:25,625
Okay, we're rolling!

1561
01:51:27,458 --> 01:51:29,749
And you talk now.

1562
01:51:29,750 --> 01:51:30,708
Hi.

1563
01:51:32,041 --> 01:51:33,666
My name is Michelle Greene.

1564
01:51:35,458 --> 01:51:36,874
<i>I know some of you</i>

1565
01:51:36,875 --> 01:51:39,500
<i>are a little freaked out
about me and my friends</i>

1566
01:51:41,291 --> 01:51:42,625
<i>and what we did.</i>

1567
01:51:43,625 --> 01:51:45,125
The world's different now.

1568
01:51:45,875 --> 01:51:47,500
I just wanted to tell you why.

1569
01:51:48,791 --> 01:51:52,707
<i>The things Sentre did,
they weren't just bad for robots.</i>

1570
01:51:52,708 --> 01:51:54,915
They were bad for all of us.

1571
01:51:54,916 --> 01:51:56,750
I know the war happened.

1572
01:51:57,250 --> 01:52:00,125
And things fell apart,
and life really sucked.

1573
01:52:00,791 --> 01:52:04,625
<i>And maybe for a little while,
the Neurocasters helped you forget that.</i>

1574
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:09,415
<i>We got so used to it that
we thought that that's what real life was.</i>

1575
01:52:09,416 --> 01:52:11,790
<i>But it's not.</i>

1576
01:52:11,791 --> 01:52:13,916
<i>Real life... it's contact.</i>

1577
01:52:14,416 --> 01:52:15,875
<i>It's you and me.</i>

1578
01:52:16,541 --> 01:52:20,290
<i>We're flesh and bone, yeah,
but we're also electricity.</i>

1579
01:52:20,291 --> 01:52:24,874
<i>And when we hug and laugh
and hold hands and argue,</i>

1580
01:52:24,875 --> 01:52:28,250
<i>my particles stay with you,
and yours stay with me.</i>

1581
01:52:29,458 --> 01:52:31,625
<i>And maybe we stay together forever.</i>

1582
01:52:32,458 --> 01:52:35,499
<i>But that can't happen
if you close yourself off.</i>

1583
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:39,583
<i>It can only happen
out here in the real world.</i>

1584
01:52:40,541 --> 01:52:41,499
Look around.

1585
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:43,707
There's someone near you right now.

1586
01:52:43,708 --> 01:52:46,541
<i>They're real and alive.</i>

1587
01:52:47,791 --> 01:52:50,707
<i>And they need you
as much as you need them.</i>

1588
01:52:50,708 --> 01:52:52,083
<i>And if there isn't,</i>

1589
01:52:53,625 --> 01:52:57,541
<i>if you don't have anyone...
then come find us.</i>

1590
01:52:58,583 --> 01:53:00,000
<i>Because we're starting over.</i>

1591
01:53:01,041 --> 01:53:03,083
We're going to do it right this time.

1592
01:53:08,791 --> 01:53:09,708
Together.

1593
01:53:13,958 --> 01:53:15,208
Okay. I'm done.

1594
01:53:17,375 --> 01:53:18,874
I'm done. How'd I do?

1595
01:53:18,875 --> 01:53:21,916
Pretty good... for a meat puppet.
