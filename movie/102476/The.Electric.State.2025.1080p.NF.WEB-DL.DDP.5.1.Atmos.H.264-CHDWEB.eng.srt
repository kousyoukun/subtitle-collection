That's actually theoretically possible.

44
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,916
Quantum physics says
that particles can stay linked

45

way after they come into contact.

46
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,875
And if everything exists
in a state of electricity,

47
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:51,041
then it's possible our consciousness
could transcend physical boundaries.

Cool.

00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:10,916
[chuckles] I look up, I see this big dumb
construction bot peering down at me.

787
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,833
I close my eyes, get ready to die,

788
00:45:12,916 --> 00:45:15,750
and instead, he just lifts me up,
carries me out.

789
00:45:15,833 --> 00:45:20,333
-[Herm] You were cryin' like a baby.
-Ha ha ha! Yeah, right. Not like a baby.

790
00:45:20,416 --> 00:45:22,500
You know they don't really know
human emotion.

791
00:45:22,583 --> 00:45:26,750
It was a war cry.
Like, "Yeah! W… Wolverines!"

792
00:45:26,833 --> 00:45:30,541
Please. You were sucking your thumb
and begging me to save your ass.

793
00:45:30,625 --> 00:45:32,791
He's… he's correct.

794
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,291
A few days later,

795
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:39,875
well, Sentre drones found us,
and I tried to tell 'em,

796
00:45:39,958 --> 00:45:44,333
"Hey, this guy saved my life.
Herm's a good guy. Don't shoot."

797
00:45:44,416 --> 00:45:46,791
[scoffs] They opened fire anyway.

798
00:45:48,041 --> 00:45:49,875
Tried to kill us both, so we ran.

799
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:52,875
We been runnin' ever since, huh?

800
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,833
Most people would think
it was weird, right?

801
00:45:54,916 --> 00:45:57,291
A robot and a guy gettin' along.
Hangin' out.

802
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,833
At least you have each other.

803
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:02,291
[Keats] So what are you gonna do
if you find your brother?

804
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:04,583
I mean, you know, the rest of him.

805
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:06,166
What do you do then?

806
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,166
Whatever we want.

807
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:11,250
[music fades]

808
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:15,375
What you makin', Mama?

809
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:19,541
[woman] It's Sunday.
What do I always make on Sunday?

810
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:21,125
[1940s music playing on radio]

811
00:46:21,208 --> 00:46:22,583
Stuffed peppers.

812
00:46:22,666 --> 00:46:25,250
-[woman] What my boy wants, my boy gets.
-[chuckles]

813
00:46:26,208 --> 00:46:29,875
As long as it's less than a nickel
and on the day-old shelf.

814
00:46:29,958 --> 00:46:31,333
You, hush.

815
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:35,458
But, not for nothing, a cannoli.

816
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:38,791
-Day old?
-Two.

817
00:46:39,291 --> 00:46:41,541
Mrs. Vella gave it on the house.

818
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,125
It's good to see you like this, Mama.

819
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:50,958
-Up and around, and…
-Why wouldn't I be?

820
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:53,750
No reason.

821
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:58,291
[chuckles] My angioletto.

822
00:46:58,375 --> 00:47:00,125
Such a funny boy.

823
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,375
Such a funny boy.

824
00:47:03,333 --> 00:47:05,041
[echoing] Such a funny boy.

[somber music playing]

828
00:47:23,666 --> 00:47:26,416
[Skate] The data-transfer rate
is dropping like a rock.

829
00:47:27,916 --> 00:47:28,750
Explain.

830
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:33,333
-Well… he told me it could wait, so--
-Uh, until I had all the facts.

831
00:47:33,416 --> 00:47:37,791
[Skate] The fact is that the service
we provide for the world

832
00:47:37,875 --> 00:47:40,208
is going from utterly flawless

833
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:43,291
to complete dog shit!

834
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,875
Why?

835
00:47:47,583 --> 00:47:49,000
-Christopher's gone.
-Louder.

836
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:51,541
Christopher… is… gone.

837
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:56,458
That's physically impossible.

838
00:47:56,541 --> 00:48:00,291
But cerebrally,
n… neurologically, he… he's not there.

839
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:04,500
Are you telling me
that my breakthrough broke out?

840
00:48:04,583 --> 00:48:08,791
[softly] There was a, uh,
tiny unsecured node in his data matrix.

841
00:48:08,875 --> 00:48:10,583
Barely noticeable really.

842
00:48:10,666 --> 00:48:14,958
And… over time,
it allowed his consciousness to, um…

843
00:48:16,041 --> 00:48:18,708
uh, well, drip past our firewalls.

844
00:48:19,583 --> 00:48:23,000
It appears that it was constructed
that way d… deliberately.

845
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:24,833
-It was Amherst.
-Well, it wasn't us, sir.

846
00:48:24,916 --> 00:48:28,250
No. Theoretically, if the Neurocaster
data speed keeps dropping…

847
00:48:28,333 --> 00:48:30,291
[man] A… and there's no reason
to think it won't.

848
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:32,416
Sentre is screwed eight ways to Sunday.

849
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,541
-More like Saturday.
-[Skate] This Saturday?

850
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:38,166
-My company collapses on Saturday?
-Friday, more likely.

851
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,916
-Shut up.
-[whispers] It could be Saturday.

852
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,375
[sighs]

853
00:48:44,958 --> 00:48:45,958
You've got mail!

[Neurocaster powering up]

856
00:49:13,375 --> 00:49:17,250
[Skate] I… I've… I've… I've always
found the natural world very soothing.

857
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:21,333
You know me?

858
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,708
Who doesn't know
the Butcher of Schenectady?

859
00:49:24,791 --> 00:49:27,833
The baddest ass on the Task Force.

860
00:49:27,916 --> 00:49:31,041
I saw your puff piece
on 60 Minutes when you retired.

861
00:49:31,125 --> 00:49:32,458
[Butcher] I didn't retire.

862
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:35,041
I just ran out of bots to hunt.

863
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:42,541
I understand that you're hunting
for a juvenile delinquent

864
00:49:43,416 --> 00:49:46,875
and her… mechanical companion.

865
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:48,958
Task Force calls, I answer.

866
00:49:49,041 --> 00:49:52,166
Hmm. Well, seems that
you and I share a common goal, then.

867
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:57,125
The girl's machine… belongs to Sentre.

868
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:01,666
-I want it back.
-The bot's wanted for assault.

869
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:04,708
-And that's an automatic termination.
-Yeah, but you could delay that.

870
00:50:05,416 --> 00:50:06,833
Once Sentre has what it needs,

871
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:09,166
you can do whatever you want
to whatever is left.

872
00:50:13,666 --> 00:50:14,833
It's a nice spot.

873
00:50:14,916 --> 00:50:17,125
-Thank you. Made it myself.
-I know.

874
00:50:17,208 --> 00:50:19,583
I saw your puff piece on 20/20.

875
00:50:19,666 --> 00:50:21,625
Then, you know

876
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,541
the incredible resources that I have.

877
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,166
Suppose I could get
your drone back online.

878
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:33,583
Why not go get him yourself?
Sentre's got the toys.

879
00:50:33,666 --> 00:50:34,666

unless there's evidence
that the treaty has been broken.

882
00:50:40,291 --> 00:50:42,166
So are you asking me to get the bot?

883
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:44,375
Or to get you evidence?

884

shall we?

where would you be?

just past the asteroid field.

shelter, defensible perimeter.

00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,291
Not the worst place in the world to hide.

-Think the food court's still open?
-[Herm] Here we go.

All the food was still good.

We got fortune cookies,
General Tso's chicken, orange chicken,

chicken fried rice, pork fried dumplings.

Oh me, oh my! Taco, humans.

943
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:23,708
Oh my God.

944
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:26,291
This is crazy.

Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to bring a very special guest

955
00:55:00,625 --> 00:55:01,958
onto our stage tonight.

956
00:55:02,041 --> 00:55:03,583
A personage so august,

957
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:05,791
a leader so towering,

958
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:09,625
he goes only by the awe-inspiring title of

959
00:55:10,208 --> 00:55:12,708
Mr. Peanut!

960
00:55:13,208 --> 00:55:14,541
No way.

961
00:55:15,041 --> 00:55:16,541
[Southern accent] Cut the guff, P.

962
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:19,416
[chuckles] You know I don't care
for all that hyperbole.

963
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:25,166
Afternoon. I'd… I'd tip my hat,
but, uh, well, it's bolted on.

964
00:55:25,666 --> 00:55:29,125
We took you down
because we thought you were Scavs.

965
00:55:29,208 --> 00:55:32,541
-Excuse me?
-See, they come round every now and again.

966
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:35,541
Just lookin' to rip us limb from limb.

967
00:55:35,625 --> 00:55:38,541
Y'all don't really look like limb-rippers,

968
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:40,750
but, you know, looks can be deceivin'.

969
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:42,500
We need to talk to you, sir.

970
00:55:42,583 --> 00:55:44,833
Yeah, humans always want
somethin' from us.

971
00:55:44,916 --> 00:55:46,875
Kinda like stink on a skunk.

972
00:55:46,958 --> 00:55:48,583
We're looking for a doctor.

973
00:55:49,541 --> 00:55:51,916
With… glasses.

974
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:57,000
Mmm, well, walk with me, will ya?

975
00:55:58,291 --> 00:56:02,750
Stupid question, I know,
but… what exactly is this place?

976
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:07,125
[Mr. Peanut] Well, uh, we haven't put up
the sign yet, but try this on for size.

977
00:56:07,666 --> 00:56:12,958
"Blue Sky Acres,
an oasis of safety in an uncaring desert."

978
00:56:13,041 --> 00:56:14,125
[Herm] Pretty catchy.

979
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:17,916
You're lookin' at the cradle
of a new mechanized civilization.

980
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,333
-Hey, Mr. Peanut.
-How do, Blitz?

981
00:56:20,416 --> 00:56:21,666
[Blitz] Ralphie, slow down!

982
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:28,041
At Blue Sky Acres, robots can evolve past
the job descriptions humans stuck on them.

983
00:56:28,125 --> 00:56:31,083
-They can pick up a new trade.
-Hair!

984

-Maybe even find their true selves.
-Hair!

00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,458
Uh-uh. Like, whoa.

986
00:56:35,541 --> 00:56:38,166
[Mr. Peanut] Mrs. Scissors,
we don't do that anymore.

987
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:40,750
-Hair.
-[Mr. Peanut] Leave the man alone, please.

988
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:43,000
-[Mrs. Scissors sighs sadly]
-Oh!

989
00:56:43,083 --> 00:56:46,500
Sir. Mr… Peanut. We need your help.

990
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:49,375
I'm sure you do, but the actual fact is

991
00:56:49,458 --> 00:56:52,541
your presence here
provides legal justification

992
00:56:52,625 --> 00:56:56,500
for Sentre to wipe out
everything these robots have built.

993
00:56:56,583 --> 00:57:00,708
Best I can do is escort you
ten miles into the desert

994
00:57:00,791 --> 00:57:02,375
and leave you on your lonesome.

995
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:05,375
I mean, after chow, of course.

Free as a bird!
Now, I hope you brought your appetite.

998
00:57:09,833 --> 00:57:12,375
I did. I never got my burrito.

999
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:14,875
Hey, read the room. It's a burger joint.

1000
00:57:14,958 --> 00:57:18,541
All right, well… I'll have a cheeseburger.

1001
00:57:18,625 --> 00:57:20,125
Oh, sorry. We're outta cheese.

1002
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:22,250
That… that's fine. Burger and fries.

1003
00:57:22,333 --> 00:57:24,625
Well, more bad news. We're outta that too.

I'mma break it down to you for real.

1006
00:57:28,708 --> 00:57:31,125
Ain't nobody ate up in here
in a long time.

1007
00:57:31,208 --> 00:57:33,291
If it was good, it's bad now.

1008
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:35,958
We got spaghetti.
We got canned beans on a Twinkie.

1009
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,583
What kind of beans?

1010
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:45,500
So your brother has no idea
where his actual human body is?

1011
00:57:45,583 --> 00:57:46,750
All he knows is Sentre.

1012

[jaunty music playing in background]

1013

Hmm! Why in the hell
would Sentre steal a little boy?

1014
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:54,625
I know. It's nuts.

-No offense.
-Get it all the time.

Chris said the doctor that took him
would be here at Tabletop.

1017
00:58:03,166 --> 00:58:04,000
Okay.

1018
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:07,166
Might as well tell you the truth.

1019
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,041
[chuckles] There was a doctor here.

1020
00:58:09,708 --> 00:58:11,208
-[Cosmo] Here we go!
-What did you say?

1021
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:16,208
Dr. Clark Amherst,
PhD in Human-Machine Interaction.

1022
00:58:16,291 --> 00:58:17,416
Well, where is he now?

1023
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,750
[Mr. Peanut] Obviously,
I gave him the boot.

1024
00:58:19,833 --> 00:58:21,083
At least he's consistent.

1025
00:58:21,166 --> 00:58:23,916
You don't know any other way outta here,
and the one person who did,

1026
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,166
you sent him off in the wilderness to die?

1027
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:27,458
Damn right I did.

1028
00:58:27,541 --> 00:58:33,041
I signed that peace treaty
because it recognized robots as a people.

1029
00:58:33,875 --> 00:58:36,125
I don't guess you'd know what it's like

1030
00:58:36,208 --> 00:58:39,166
to have your very right to exist
depend on a piece of paper.

1031
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:42,250
All this, it's fragile, man,

1032
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:45,666
and there was no way
I was gonna let that doctor threaten it

1033
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:47,083
any more than I'll let you.

1034
00:58:47,166 --> 00:58:49,500
Dr. Amherst is a kidnapper.

1035
00:58:49,583 --> 00:58:53,166
This is the little boy he took.
You gonna treat those two people the same?

1036
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:56,833
But all humans are the same.
Selfish and lazy.

1037
00:58:56,916 --> 00:59:00,666
Once you figure that out, little girl,
you'll live a much simpler life.

1038
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:01,708
Come on.

1039
00:59:02,708 --> 00:59:03,541
Young lady?

1040
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:07,458
I would not advise you
to go out there at night.

1041
00:59:07,541 --> 00:59:09,500
I really don't care
about what you would advise.

1042
00:59:09,583 --> 00:59:11,416
Think you're building
something special here?

1043
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,333
You're just like everyone out there.

1044
00:59:14,791 --> 00:59:15,791
Thanks for the ride.

1045
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,041
Bon appétit.

-What?
-[Herm] Really?

1048
00:59:24,583 --> 00:59:27,500
-I gotta eat.

[Keats growls]

1050

-Where you goin'?
-There are cars in the parking lot.

1051
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:38,041
I'll get one
and drive until I find the doctor.

1052
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:40,250
Come on,
it's 100,000 square miles out there.

1053
00:59:40,333 --> 00:59:44,041
-Chances of finding them are pretty slim.
-Chances of finding him in here are zero.

1054
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:47,083
The chances of not dyin' in here
are pretty high.

1055
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,958
You can't go out in the EX after dark.

1056
00:59:49,041 --> 00:59:51,250
I mean, listen,
you're just gonna have to trust me.

Hey. For real.
Your sister's no good to you dead.

Look at that face.

1059
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:03,250
How can you deny
that weird robot-head face?

1060
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:04,500
Hang out!

1061
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,333
Go to Orange Julius.

1062
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:08,333
It's a mall. Steal some shit.

1063
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:10,708
Leave in the mornin'.

1064
01:00:14,166 --> 01:00:15,000
Fine.

1065
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:18,333
We'll get killed in the morning.

You have any fun "reading"?

1076
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:02,708
Better than here.

1077
01:01:02,791 --> 01:01:04,125
Ever since you left,

if Mom and Dad aren't yelling
at each other, they're yelling at me.

-Good thing I'm moving home, then.
-Shut up. I'll be fine.

1080
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:15,458
That's super debatable,
but I wouldn't be doing it for you.

-What, you graduate early or something?
-Not exactly.

01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:44,500
-Seattle. Sentre's island campus.
-Why did you take him?

1247
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:46,833
People were dying.

1248
01:10:47,666 --> 01:10:49,500
We were losing the war.

1249
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:51,041
Until we found him.

1250
01:10:51,125 --> 01:10:52,583
After your accident,

1251
01:10:52,666 --> 01:10:56,375
a Sentre imaging machine
alerted us to Christopher.

1252
01:10:56,458 --> 01:10:58,375
He was special, okay?

1253
01:10:58,458 --> 01:11:03,041
He was exactly what we needed.
Christopher was like…

1254
01:11:04,291 --> 01:11:06,208
He was like a gift from God.

1255
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:10,333
You held my hand,

1256
01:11:11,625 --> 01:11:12,875
and you lied to me.

1257
01:11:14,666 --> 01:11:16,708
Please. You need to understand.

1258
01:11:16,791 --> 01:11:18,625
Don't tell me what I need.

1259
01:11:19,958 --> 01:11:23,833
Don't tell me about the damn war
and gifts from God.

1260
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:28,000
Just tell me what you did with my brother.

1261
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:33,166
[poignant music playing]

1262
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:35,791
PC.

1263
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,291
Will you join us, please?

1264
01:11:39,125 --> 01:11:41,125
[computer booting up]

1265
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,583
-Herm, Herm, Herm!
-[Penny] Oh my God.

1266
01:11:44,666 --> 01:11:47,000
Whoa, whoa. Hey, pal,
you been creepin' on us the whole time?

1267
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:50,375
[Amherst's voice] If by "creeping,"
you mean responsibly avoiding the threat

1268
01:11:50,458 --> 01:11:52,291
of monitor burn-in, then yes!

1269
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:55,625
Why the heck
does this bot speak with your voice?

1270
01:11:55,708 --> 01:11:58,291
[PC] Dr. Amherst rescued me
from the Scavengers.

1271
01:11:58,375 --> 01:12:00,375
My voice module had been torn out.

1272
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,083
I recorded PC a vocabulary
of over 100,000 words.

1273
01:12:05,458 --> 01:12:07,625
He's my hard drive and friend.

1274
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:09,791
He knows what I know.

1275
01:12:10,708 --> 01:12:12,041
Show them 17-9.

1276
01:12:12,125 --> 01:12:13,458
Yes, Doctor.

1277
01:12:15,708 --> 01:12:18,541
Blueprint Trial Nine. Test Subject Alpha.

1278
01:12:19,125 --> 01:12:21,750
Christopher was comatose.
We thought it was permanent.

1279
01:12:23,416 --> 01:12:26,125
We looked at it like… organ donation.

1280
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:27,916
Damn, it's like human Scavs.

1281
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,875
[Amherst] We needed an impossible amount
of computing power to run the network.

1282
01:12:32,541 --> 01:12:34,791
Your brother's mind
was the breakthrough Skate needed

1283
01:12:34,875 --> 01:12:37,333
to link the Neurocasters and the drones.

1284
01:12:37,416 --> 01:12:40,291
Congratulations, doc.
I think you just won us the war.

1285
01:12:40,375 --> 01:12:41,750
You're disgusting.

1286
01:12:41,833 --> 01:12:46,083
If we didn't do what we did,
Christopher would've died in the hospital.

1287
01:12:46,166 --> 01:12:47,625
We saved his life.

1288
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:50,500
-That's not your choice.
-So you would've pulled the plug?

1289
01:12:52,541 --> 01:12:53,541
If I had to.

1290
01:12:54,208 --> 01:12:56,458
Then you would've been as wrong as I was.

1291
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:00,041
23-6.

1292
01:13:01,541 --> 01:13:03,166
Thirteen months later…

1293
01:13:03,916 --> 01:13:05,833
[music intensifies]

[somber music playing]

1295
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:25,916
[whispers] Oh my God.

1296
01:13:29,583 --> 01:13:31,208
Oh, I can't look.

1297
01:13:31,291 --> 01:13:32,291
Shut it down.

1298
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:36,083
I told Skate we had to disconnect him.

1299
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,666
Skate threatened to kill me.

1300
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:42,416
There was no way
I could get Chris out of Sentre.

1301
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,166
So, before I ran,

1302
01:13:44,875 --> 01:13:48,500
I established a tiny connection
between Chris and the outside network.

1303
01:13:48,583 --> 01:13:50,208
His mind could escape

1304
01:13:51,208 --> 01:13:52,541
even if his body couldn't.

1305
01:13:52,625 --> 01:13:54,541
You told him to head to Blue Sky.

1306
01:13:54,625 --> 01:13:58,416
I heard about what you were building,
so I implanted the location in his mind.

1307
01:13:58,500 --> 01:13:59,333
Why?

1308
01:14:01,416 --> 01:14:03,333
I wanted him to find a family.

1309
01:14:03,416 --> 01:14:05,583
-He already had a family!
-[Keats] Hey.

1310
01:14:05,666 --> 01:14:06,500
Relax.

1311
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,416
Everybody, relax.

1312

-[Penny] Oh!
-[Keats] Hurts more when they're relaxed.

1314
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:14,625
That was unexpected.

1315
01:14:14,708 --> 01:14:15,750
I saw it comin'.

1316
01:14:16,791 --> 01:14:19,166
-We're gonna go get Chris.
-You can't do that.

1317
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:21,250
Yes, I can.

1318
01:14:21,333 --> 01:14:24,041
-And you're gonna help.
-It's not possible.

1319
01:14:24,125 --> 01:14:27,375
You got into the EX,
which means you can get us out.

1320

-You have no idea the s--
-[Penny] Guys?

-Who is that?
-The Butcher of Schenectady.

1323

Oh! Oh.

1324
01:14:40,583 --> 01:14:42,083
We have to act quickly.

Not anymore.

Well, if it isn't the king of misfit toys.

[Mr. Peanut] No kings here.

1724
01:42:06,583 --> 01:42:08,625
and there are intruders in the building.

1725
01:42:08,708 --> 01:42:10,958
-[Skate] Take him out.
-[drone] Affirmative, sir.

1726
01:42:11,458 --> 01:42:12,833
Keats, get up!

1727
01:42:12,916 --> 01:42:15,458
Aaaargh! [groaning with effort]

1728
01:42:20,041 --> 01:42:20,916
[Skate gasps]

1729
01:42:22,416 --> 01:42:23,458
Howdy do, Ethan.

1730
01:42:24,750 --> 01:42:27,708
[chuckles] Look, I don't know, um,

1731
01:42:27,791 --> 01:42:31,250
what you think you're trying to
achieve here, Mr… Nut.

1732
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:34,750
I'm here to renegotiate the treaty.

1733
01:42:41,041 --> 01:42:44,541
Come on! Come out here
and fight me like a man!

1734
01:42:44,625 --> 01:42:47,166
You want some of me, come and get me!

1735
01:42:47,250 --> 01:42:50,791
-Okay, Herm. All right. Herm!
-Don't send a drone to do a man's…

1736
01:42:50,875 --> 01:42:52,958
-Think you got 'im.
-…job! [groaning]

1737
01:42:54,458 --> 01:42:57,375
Thing is, he might've got me too.

1738
01:42:58,583 --> 01:43:00,791
You got a big hole
in your guts here, buddy.

1739
01:43:01,833 --> 01:43:05,666
-I'm gonna power save for a… a little bit.
-Oh no. Hang on.

1740
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:07,083
[Herm] Ow! Ow! [moans]

1741
01:43:07,583 --> 01:43:10,500
[chuckling] How the hell
are you still alive?

1742
01:43:10,583 --> 01:43:13,541
How am I still alive?
I'm alive because of you, you bastard.

1743
01:43:15,958 --> 01:43:17,500
You're damn right.

1744
01:43:23,166 --> 01:43:24,125
[PC] Michelle?

1745
01:43:24,208 --> 01:43:25,875
I'm so sorry to interrupt,

1746
01:43:25,958 --> 01:43:29,458
but our friends
are in a lot of trouble out there.

1747
01:43:29,541 --> 01:43:32,375
-I'm working on it.
-Uh, we may be running out of time.

1748
01:43:32,458 --> 01:43:33,333
He's right.

1749
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:37,208
-I'm not pulling your plug.
-You said you would if you had to.

1750
01:43:37,291 --> 01:43:40,666
I don't have to. We'll find another robot.
You can use that.

1751
01:43:40,750 --> 01:43:42,583
They locked me in tight this time.

1752
01:43:43,875 --> 01:43:47,291
-There's no choice here.
-There's always a choice.

1753
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:52,416
Everybody told me to move on,
but I couldn't.

1754
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:54,916
You were all I had.

1755
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,208
I held onto you.

1756
01:43:56,291 --> 01:43:57,291
And it worked.

1757
01:43:57,375 --> 01:43:58,833
I got you back.

1758
01:43:58,916 --> 01:44:00,291
That's why this is okay.

1759
01:44:00,375 --> 01:44:01,208
No.

1760
01:44:01,791 --> 01:44:03,416
None of this is okay.

1761
01:44:04,458 --> 01:44:08,166
I haven't felt anything in three years.

1762
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:13,333
But out there with you,
I felt everything, and it was awesome.

1763
01:44:14,708 --> 01:44:15,916
And you gave me that.

1764
01:44:18,708 --> 01:44:19,791
If that's all I get,

1765
01:44:21,041 --> 01:44:23,791
it… it's enough. [exhales]

1766
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:28,416
Michelle, we are running out of time.

1767
01:44:30,083 --> 01:44:32,291
[voice breaking] Oh, I can't. I can't.

1768

[poignant music playing]

1769
01:44:44,208 --> 01:44:46,208
I don't wanna lose you all over again.

1770
01:44:47,541 --> 01:44:48,791
You can't lose me.

1771
01:44:49,458 --> 01:44:51,041
[PC] Michelle, can you hear me?

1772
01:44:52,166 --> 01:44:53,375
Please answer me.

1773
01:44:55,041 --> 01:44:56,375
But you can lose them.

1774
01:44:59,458 --> 01:45:03,000
You. You're the one
who's gonna change the world.

1775
01:45:04,333 --> 01:45:06,166
You know,
I never got to say goodbye to you.

1776
01:45:07,666 --> 01:45:08,916
You never have to.

1777
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,041
I love you.

1778
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:18,458
I love you too.

Yeah!

Woo-hoo!

We won, Pops.

1795

Funny thing about winning.

1796

Someone always loses.

without my best friend? [sniffs]

You make me smile.
You used to make me smile.

Now what am I supposed to do?
Just go back to being a… what?

Get the band back together?
Those guys are all married.

Oh, it's the eight-inch model
for detail work.

1818

Detail? I… You… I never…
I've never seen this!

1819
01:48:55,208 --> 01:48:58,916
I've never seen your eight-inch model,
and I imagine I'm being generous.

1820
01:48:59,541 --> 01:49:00,375
Wait…

1821
01:49:01,458 --> 01:49:02,583
You said you were dyin'.

1822
01:49:02,666 --> 01:49:06,083
No, I said I had to sleep
to save power for the transfer.

1823
01:49:06,166 --> 01:49:08,541
Not my fault you got all emotional
and told your truth.

1824
01:49:08,625 --> 01:49:11,208
[laughs sarcastically, sniffs] Emotional?!

1825
01:49:11,291 --> 01:49:14,750
By the way, I didn't catch everything
you were sayin' out here.

1826
01:49:14,833 --> 01:49:16,916
Uh, would you mind repeatin' some of it?

1827
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,833
I… I said we won.

1828
01:49:18,916 --> 01:49:21,958
I said we won! What…
Look around, we won. She did it.

1829
01:49:22,541 --> 01:49:25,291
That's not what I heard.
I heard, "I love you."

01:49:25,375 --> 01:49:27,916
-I heard, "More than a friend."
-I don't think I said that.

Holy shit, did we win?

[Skate] So what now?

1835
01:49:39,125 --> 01:49:40,333
Do I die?

1836

[Mr. Peanut] No.

sell your stock!

I don't wanna waste another word
on this guy.

But you know who I wanna talk about?

The girl who trucked a ton of bots
to Seattle to kick Skate's butt.

01:51:06,375 --> 01:51:07,958
Are you sure you wanna do this?

1862

-Gotta connect those particles.
-Mm.

[Herm] Okay, we're rolling!

1866
01:51:27,458 --> 01:51:29,750
And you talk now.

1867
01:51:29,833 --> 01:51:30,708
Hi.

1868
01:51:32,041 --> 01:51:33,666
My name is Michelle Greene.

1869
01:51:35,458 --> 01:51:36,875
I know some of you

1870
01:51:36,958 --> 01:51:39,500
are a little freaked out
about me and my friends

1871
01:51:41,291 --> 01:51:42,625
and what we did.

1872
01:51:43,625 --> 01:51:45,125
The world's different now.

1873
01:51:45,875 --> 01:51:47,500
I just wanted to tell you why.

1874
01:51:48,791 --> 01:51:52,708
The things Sentre did,
they weren't just bad for robots.

1875
01:51:52,791 --> 01:51:54,916
They were bad for all of us.

1876
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,750
I know the war happened.

1877
01:51:57,250 --> 01:52:00,125
And things fell apart,
and life really sucked.

1878
01:52:00,791 --> 01:52:04,625
And maybe for a little while,
the Neurocasters helped you forget that.

1879
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:09,416
We got so used to it that
we thought that that's what real life was.

01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:11,791
-But it's not.

[Michelle] Real life… it's contact.

1882
01:52:14,416 --> 01:52:15,875
It's you and me.

1883
01:52:16,541 --> 01:52:20,291
We're flesh and bone, yeah,
but we're also electricity.

1884
01:52:20,375 --> 01:52:24,875
And when we hug and laugh
and hold hands and argue,

1885
01:52:24,958 --> 01:52:28,250
my particles stay with you,
and yours stay with me.

1886
01:52:29,458 --> 01:52:31,625
And maybe we stay together forever.

1887
01:52:32,458 --> 01:52:35,500
But that can't happen
if you close yourself off.

1888
01:52:35,583 --> 01:52:39,583
It can only happen
out here in the real world.

1889

Look around.

1890
01:52:41,583 --> 01:52:43,708
There's someone near you right now.

1891
01:52:43,791 --> 01:52:46,541
They're real and alive.

1892
01:52:47,791 --> 01:52:50,708
And they need you
as much as you need them.

1893
01:52:50,791 --> 01:52:52,083

if you don't have anyone…
then come find us.

Because we're starting over.

We're going to do it right this time.
