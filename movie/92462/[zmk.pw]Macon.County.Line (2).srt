This is your cat on the mic,Dr. Daddy-O - Put your leg up.

00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:27,452
在节奏的综合播放一些旧的，一些新的，一些借来的和一些蓝色。
Moving right along on Rhythm Roundup playing some old, some new,some borrowed and some blue.

4
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,670
你爱我吗，宝贝?

你的脚后跟跟在我后面，快点。

00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,712
这是另一个10美元。

把屁股抬高一点。

00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,430
该死的，把你的手从我屁股上拿开。

11
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,928
对不起。

12
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:10,419
好吧。

13
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,708
像这样挤压它。

14
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:12,580
到这里来。

你最好把排气管穿好。

31
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,118
你这个混蛋。

放开我，该死的，放开我。

33
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,457
该死的你。

34
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,707
有人会回来睡觉吗?
Would somebody come on back to bed?

35
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:17,922
-你个混蛋-我的牛仔裤呢?
- You son of a bitch. - Where's my jeans?

36
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:18,755
我的鞋子在哪里?

我找不到我的裤子了。

41
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,757
我拿了钱包，来吧。

42
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,636
韦恩,帮帮我!

43
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,386
操，你个狗娘养的!

44
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,639
嘿，你要去哪儿?
Hey, where are you going?

45
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,856
你混蛋。
You bastards.

46
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,353
该死的六块钱，那个婊子。
Six lousy goddamn dollars, that whore.

47
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,770
我以为我一个人就值那么多钱。
I thought I was worth that much alone.

48
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,396
看来你没拿到钱啊，兄弟。
Looks like you didn't get paid, brother.

49
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,737
来吧，克里斯，我们走。

50
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,478
好吧，车在哪儿?
All right, where's the car?

51
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,689
它已经被拖走了。
It's been towed away.

52
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,225
你怎么知道?
How do you know?

53
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,904
你怎么知道?
How do you know?

54
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,240
因为它不在这里，我能读。
Because it's not here and I can read.

55
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,074
哦,太好了。
Aw, that's great.

56
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,739
现在我们到底该怎么办?
Now what the hell are we gonna do?

57

58
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,408
在哪里?
Where?

59
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,787
他们把车拖到了那里。
To where they towed it.

60
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,830
嗯，我不知道。
Well, I don't know.

61
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:19,702
哦,狗屎。
Oh, shit.

62
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,504
嘿，你这个混蛋!
Hey, you son of a bitch!

63
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,275
我让她叫了，韦恩。
I had her barking, Wayne.

64
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,867
-你看到了吗?——是的。
- Did you see that? - Yep.

65
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,330
那是我的车。
That's my car there.

66
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:51,880
看到,850 - 263。——是啊，跟你的注册记录相符。
See that, 850-263. - Yeah,that checks with your registration.

67
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,632
你有钱把它弄出来吗?
You got the dough to get it out?

68
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:55,925
你在开玩笑吧?
Are you kidding?

69
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,011
不。
No.

70
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:58,925
是的，我有钱。
Yeah, I got the dough.

71
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,094
你需要多少，老爸?
How much you need, pops?

72
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,392
15美元,拖曳。
$15, towing.

73
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,889
5美元,存储。
$5, storage.

74
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,098
税是21美元。
And tax comes to $21.

75
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,683
嘿，这对你来说会容易很多。
Hey, this will make it a lot easier for you.

76
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,026
嘿，这是什么狗屁税收?
Hey, what's this tax crap here?

77
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,237
男人说:“收州税。”
The man says, "Collect the state tax."

78
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,981
所以我们征收州税。
So we collect the state tax.

79
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,566
法律不是我定的。
I don't make the laws.

80
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,119
是啊，我知道，你只是遵守它们，不是吗?
Yeah, I know, you just abide by them, don't you?

81
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,408
含税21美元，你有1美元吗?
It's $21 including tax, you got a dollar?

82
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:40,011
-是这样吗?-我感谢你们，国家感谢你们。
- Is that right? - I thank you and the state thanks you.

83
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,719
顺便说一下，你放在后座上的装备在后备箱里，这样就不会被偷了。
By the way, the gear you left in the back seat is in the trunk compartment so it wouldn't be stolen.

84
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,608
我感谢你，我的朋友也感谢你。
I thank you and my friend thanks you.

85
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,478
这老头。
That old fart.

86
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,694
税收，你能相信吗?
Tax, can you believe that?

87
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:04,370
他们会来抢你的车，收取你5美元的停车费，然后再向你收税。
They come snatch your car,charge you $5 storage and then they tax you to get it out.

88
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,158
该死的。
Goddamn.

89
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,494
税。

90
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,540
嘿,女士。
Hey, ma'am.

91
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,173
男厕所在哪里?
Where's the men's restroom?

92
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,504
就在点唱机的左边。
It's right down there to the left of the jukebox.

93
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,552
好的，能再给我来点咖啡吗?
Okay, can I have some more coffee?

94
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:51,051
好的，再来一份吐司，好吗?
Yeah, and another order of toast, please?

95
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,269
你要加黄油吗?
You want it buttered?

96
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,479
是的。
Yeah.

97
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:00,818

汤姆。-嗨。

00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,747
来两杯咖啡，维娜。
Two cups of coffee, Verna.

101
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,379
给老汤姆一块苹果派。
And give old Tom here a piece of apple pie.

102
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,457
嘿，艾德，你怎么没去詹姆斯医生家?
Hey, Ed, how come you ain't over at Doc James' house?

103
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,668
斗鸡大约一点半开始。
Cockfight starts about 1:30.

104
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,333
你知道我再也不去看詹姆斯医生了。

106
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,166
这是正确的。

他靠经营经营赚的钱更多。

我再也不去看詹姆斯医生了。

110
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,638
我不再去看詹姆斯医生了。
I don't go to Doc James anymore.

111
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:21,312
我不去看詹姆斯医生，已经有三四个星期没去了。
I don't go to Doc James,haven't been there for three or four weeks.

112
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,606

那个孩子和另一个人?

他们刚把我从支票上扣了下来，去拿吧。

I wanna see their faces so bad I'm almost tempted to turn around and go back.

Next time, son of a bitch, you drink the coffee and I eat the breakfast, I'm starved.

126

-你饿了吗?——我饿死了。

140
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,664
<i>把它放在你的Studebaker上
<i>Put it on your Studebaker.</i>

141
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,454
<i>现在有请卡尔·帕金斯先生
<i>And now, Mr. Carl Perkins.</i>

142
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:46,795
<i>他有点白，但他还好
<i>He's a little white, but he's all right.</i>

143
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,292
嗨,红薯。
Hi, sweet potato.

144
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,716
-我叫珍妮·斯科特，好吗?——好的。
- Name's Jenny Scott, okay? - Okay.

145
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,210
我20岁了。
I'm 20 years old.

146
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,428
好。
Good.

147
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,426
昨天我被一个老南方男孩接走了。
Yesterday I got picked up by this old Southern boy.

148
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,803
他说我让他想起了他的女儿。
He said I reminded him of his daughter.

149
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,100
在她14岁的时候上了她。
Screwed her when she was 14.

150
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,727
今天有个古巴移民和他的胖老婆来接我。
Today this Cuban immigrant and his fat wife picked me up.

151
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:15,657
他不停地摸我的腿  而她却对此一笑置之。
He kept putting his goddamn hand on my leg and all she could do was laugh about it.

152
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,578
你们俩有什么打算?
So what do you two got in mind, hm?

153
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,626
我们只是想把手放在你腿上，仅此而已。
Oh, we just wanna put our hand on your leg, that's all.

154
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:36,386
于是法官说，“孩子，你会被判三年。你要么去参军，要么进监狱。
So the judge said,"Son, you're gonna get three years.You're either going in the military or you're going to jail.

155
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:43,602
我说，“法官大人，既然我不喜欢监禁，美军将在接下来的三年里拥有我。
I said, "Your Honor, since I'm not partial to incarceration, the United States Military's gonna have my company for the next three years.

156
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,557
然后他又入伍了这样我们就能加入伙伴制度了。
Then he re-enlisted so we could go in on the buddy system.

157
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,685
是啊，法官给了我们几周时间再入伍。
Yeah, the judge gave us a couple of weeks before we re-enlist.

158
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:57,274
所以这两周，我们就在外面鬼混，尽情狂欢。
So for these two weeks,we're just gonna be out catting around and having us a ball.

159
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,948
就这样，下周一，我们就走了。
That's it, a week from Monday, we're gone.

160
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:00,740
再见。
Goodbye.

161
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,909
但与此同时，你看。
But in the meantime, see.

162
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:08,957
嘿，别碰她的腿。
Hey, don't be touching her leg.

163
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:11,171
顺便说一下，这是我弟弟，韦恩，我是克里斯。
By the way this is my brother, Wayne, and I'm Chris.

164
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,254
-嗨。-嗨。
- Hi. - Hi.

165
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,420
你做了什么才被判三年的?
What did you do to get three years?

166
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:18,761
用专业术语来说，我所做的是什么?
Well, the technical term for what I did was,what was it?

167
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:23,133
这是用友方武器攻击，意图造成身体伤害。
It was assault with a friendly weapon with the intent of doing bodily harm.

168
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,134
都是他的错。
It's all his fault.

169
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:27,099
从我们小时候起，他就一直给我们惹麻烦。
Ever since we were kids,he's been getting us into trouble.

170
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,223
这是千真万确的事实。
That's the God's honest truth.

171
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,690
你就是那个总是给我们惹麻烦的人。
You're the one that's always getting us into trouble.

172
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,563
是我帮我们摆脱困境的。-你在说什么?
I'm the one that's getting us out of it. - What're you talking about?

173
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,311
你做了什么…-你开玩笑吧?
What did you do... - You shitting me?

174
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,939
我要，我是救我们出去的人。
I'm getting, I'm the one that gets us out.

175
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,654
那上次你在工地上用M-80向警长扔枪呢。
What about that time you threw an M-80 at that sheriff out there on that construction site.

176
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,406
-嘿，等一下。-就在他脑袋旁边爆炸了。——对不起。
- Hey, wait a minute. - It went off right next to his head. - Excuse me.

177
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:43,449
照亮了整个天空。
Lit up the whole sky.

178
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,989
-嘿，你可以跑的。-你做了什么被判三年?
- Hey, you could've run. - What did you do to get three years?

179
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,536
我做了。
I did run.

180
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,953
不，我跟你说，一切都始于，我打了我老妈
No, I tell you what, it all started,you see, when I hit my old lady.

181
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,124
你打了你妈妈，是吗?
You hit your mother, huh?

182
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,918
就几次，没什么大不了的。
Just a couple of times, it wasn't a big deal.

183
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,587
伟大的,为什么?
Great, great why?

184
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,551
我们在和她约会。
We were rolling some of her dates.

185
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,805
她觉得自己没有得到应得的那份面包。
And she didn't think that she was getting her fair share of the bread.

186
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,764
她以为我们把钱都装进了自己的口袋。
She thought we were pocketing all the money.

187
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:09,979
所以她像野兽一样冲过来   她的钉鞋正好打在了我的脖子后面。
So she charged at me like an animal and she sunk this spiked-heel shoe right in the back of my neck.

188
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:10,813
是吗?
Yeah?

189
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,767
事实上，你可以把手指插进去。
As a matter of fact,you can stick your finger in it.

190
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,860
就在这里，你的食指。
Right there, your index finger.

191
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,899
就在我的表皮丛里。
Right there in my cutepus plexus.

192
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:25,787
所以她，呃，当她这么做的时候，我就像那样喂了她一拳
And so she, uh,when she did that, I went like that and I fed her a knuckle sandwich.

193
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:32,627
是啊，我把她绑在了双导火索上  把她的脖子弯下来，把她撑起来。
Yeah, I had her in a double firebrand had her neck bent down, stretched her out.

194
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,416
我有它。
I had it.

195
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,339
韦恩，每次我们讲这个故事，都会越来越精彩。
Wayne, every time we tell that story,it gets better and better.

196
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,544
相信你所做的。
Sure you did.

197
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,386
——嗨,里德。——嗨,Gurn。
- Hi, Reed. - Hi, Gurn.

198
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,064
运来了一批艾萨卡斯。
Got a shipment of Ithacas in.

199
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:56,026
好价钱，在开季前打八折。
Good price, 20% off before the season starts.

200
00:19:56,028 --> 00:20:00,155
这个你想卖多少钱?
Hey, uh,how much you want for this one?

201
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,738
哦，大概在60美元左右。
Oh, roughly in the neighborhood of $60.

202
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:13,126
加上你的折扣，大概是50美元。
Now, with your discount, that'll be about 50.

203
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,745
但你还想要把枪干什么?
But what do you want another gun for?

204
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,498
你一个月前就买了那辆勃朗宁。
You bought that Browning over and under a month back.

205
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,374
那不是给我的，是给卢克的。
That isn't for me, it's for Luke.

206
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,344
你为什么要给卢克买那样的大枪?
What do you wanna get Luke a big gun like that for?

207
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:26,222
我有一堆。410和20口径在后面  那对他来说很合适。
I got a bunch of. 410s and 20-gauges back there that'd be just right for him.

208
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:27,470
嘿，葛恩，过来。
Hey, Gurn, come here.

209
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,265
我去给卢克拿个12口径的。
I'm gonna get Luke a 12-gauge.

210
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,013
他能搞定我的。
He can handle mine pretty good.

211
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,605
他现在多大了?
How old is he now?

212
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,644
他是10。
He's 10.

213
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,937
管你呢。
The hell you say.

214
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:37,730
是的。
Yeah.

215
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,856
我十岁的时候就能很好地应付我爸的12口径手枪。
I could handle my daddy's 12-gauge pretty good when I was 10.

216
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:47,198
该死，我一定是老了。
Goddamn, I must be getting old.

217
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,614
我还记得你爸爸给你买的第一把枪。
I can remember when your daddy bought you your first gun.

218
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,332
但我发誓你比那个年纪大。
But I could've swore you were older than that.

219
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:56,252
当你到了我这个年纪时，头脑会捉弄你。
Mind plays tricks on you when you get my age.

220
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,544
除非你说的是钱。
Except when you're talking about money.

221
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:04,545
它来自于一种真正强烈的想要规律饮食的欲望。
It comes from a real strong desire to eat regular.

222
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,430
你看起来不像会错过很多晚餐。
Well, you don't look like you miss many meals.

223
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,550
你最多只能出50块?
Hey, 50 the best you can do?

224
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,143
是的。
Yep.

225
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,308
但我要20，你可以欠我30。
But I'll take 20 and you can owe me 30.

226
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,726
月底把钱付给我。
Pay me at the end of the month.

227
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,941
甚至不会收你任何利息。
Won't even charge you any interest.

228
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:21,687
好吧，那我给你十块钱怎么样?
Yeah, but, what about I give you 10?

229
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:26,283
瑞德，我的大脑不会对我耍那么多花招。
Reed, my mind don't play me that many tricks.

230
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,071
好吧。
Okay.

231
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:32,534
但听着，如果我晚一点还你剩下的钱，你可别生气。
But look it, don't get mad if I'm a little late in paying you the rest.

232
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,543
可能又是油泵的问题。
It's probably that fuel pump again.

233
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,503
你停车让我来开吧?
Why don't you pull over and let me drive?

234
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:41,373
你不累吗?
Aren't you tired?

235
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,124
不，我一点也不累。
No, I'm not tired at all.

236
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,717
好吧。
All right.

237
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,507
你想坐到后座上去好好爽一下吗?
You wanna get in the back seat and rack it up?

238
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:47,345
你知道我想要什么吗?
You know what I want?

239
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:49,806
我要一个花生酱和果冻三明治。
I want a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

240
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,523
好吗?
Well?

241
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:52,782
你确定你不愿意用那匹母马  换四个翻新版和两个拖拉机轮胎吗?
Well, you're,you sure you won't trade that mare for the four retreads and the two tractor tires?

242
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:58,249
我跟你说过了，汉普，这匹母马是小马驹，你可以花一块钱买两匹。
I've told you, Hamp, the mare's in foal and you'd be getting two for the price of one.

243
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:59,038
没有,先生。
No, sir.

244
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:01,244
没有,先生。
No, sir.

245
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:05,423
如果那匹母马没有产下小马驹，我就会给你四个改版。
If that mare hadn't been in foal,I would have given you the four retreads.

246
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:09,377
单是这匹马就值四个翻新版和四个拖拉机轮胎。
The mare alone is worth four retreads and four tractor tires.

247
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:18,937
你一定认为我是个乡巴佬才会同意这样的交易。
You must think I'm some kind of hick to go for a deal like that.

248
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:25,777
如果上帝要给这个世界灌肠  他就会在这里用软管。
If the Lord was gonna give the world an enema right here is where he'd stick the hose.

249
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:40,371
好。
Well.

250
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:50,968
去年，你说你想用母马换四个翻新版和两个拖拉机轮胎。
Last year, you said that you wanted to trade the mare for four retreads and two tractor tires.

251
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:55,298
我告诉过你我会考虑的，我已经考虑过了，你懂的。
And I told you I'd think about it,and I have thought about it you get the idea.

252
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:57,767
我要接受你的提议。
And I'm gonna take you up on your offer.

253
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,931
好吧，我告诉你。
Well, let me tell you something.

254
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,476
去年是七个月前。
Last year was seven months ago.

255
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:05,851
我已经从老吉姆·古奇那里拿到了翻新版和拖拉机轮胎。
And I already got the retreads and the tractor tires from old Jim Gooch.

256
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:10,488
我也不知道我们做交易的时候母马会产下马驹。
And I also didn't know the mare was gonna get herself in foal when we made the deal.

257
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:14,743
所以如果你还想要那匹母马，你就得加点甜头。
So if you still want that mare,you gotta sweeten the pie.

258
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:18,951
我现在得回家了以免丽塔开始嚷嚷我毁了她的晚餐。
Now, I gotta get home now before Rita starts yelling about my ruining her supper.

259
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,574
周日见。
I'll see you Sunday.

260
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:25,329
记住，如果你还在思考这个问题想想给派加糖。
And remember, if you're still thinking on it think of sweetening that pie.

261
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:27,588
再见。
Goodbye.

262
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,548
待会儿见。
I'll see you later on.

263
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:37,345
汉普，你找到那匹母马了吗?
Hamp, did you get the mare?

264
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:42,645
不，不，他说他会考虑一下然后周日告诉我们。
No, no, he said he's gonna think on it and let us know Sunday.

265
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:48,522
我几个月前就叫你去换那匹母马了  但你一直说他只能换四个翻新的
I told you to trade for that mare months ago but you kept saying he'd come down to four retreads.

266
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:49,940
好吧,他没有。
Well, he didn't.

267
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:52,030
现在他正在思考这个问题。
And now he's thinking on it.

268
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,984
你们俩之间，什么都不能做。
Between the two of you, nothing never be done.

269
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,278
她是我生活的祸害。
Oh, she's the bane of my existence.

270
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,870
我可以填满吗?
Can I fill it?

271
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:00,909
没有,先生。
No, sir.

272
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,203
是燃油泵的问题。
It's the fuel pump.

273
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,418
不是卡住了就是坏了。
Think it's either jammed or broken.

274
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,413
让我看看。
Let me see it.

275
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,961
像这样多久了?
How long has it been like that?

276
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:15,261
挺长时间了，但我们还是走到了这一步。
Oh, quite some time,but it got us to here, though.

277
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,223
好吧，你不会有别的地方了。
Well, it won't get you any place else.

278
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,262
你看到那个球了吗?
You see that catch there?

279
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,177
是的。
Yeah.

280
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,022
你得把那个钓索修好，不然它会掉下去。
You gotta fix that catch before it'll go any place.

281
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:29,439
现在，你需要的是一个新泵。
Now, what you need is a new pump.

282
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,232
我们卖新的泵。
And we sell new pumps.

283
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,637
嗨,蜂蜜。
Hi, honey.

284
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:06,933
嗨。
Hi.

285
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,147
嘿，你怎么回来了?
Hey, what are you doing home?

286
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,140
我得换件衬衫。
I gotta change this shirt.

287
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,359
外面太热了。
It's so damn hot out there.

288
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,938
嘿,李在哪儿?
Hey, where's Lee?

289
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,985
他打电话说他不来了。
Oh, he called to say he wasn't coming by.

290
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,362
他不得不去看医生治疗糖尿病。
And he had to go to the doctor about his diabetes.

291
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,951
糖尿病
Diabetes.

292
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,991
他只是宿醉没醒，就这样。
He's just hung-over, that's all.

293
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,619
我觉得我们永远都建不了新房子了。
I don't think we're ever gonna get that new house built.

294
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,993
在李看来，一切都结束了。
As far as Lee's concerned, it's finished.

295
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,619
他还没开始呢。
He hasn't even started on it yet.

296
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,416
嘿。
Hey.

297
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,163
抢手货。
Good catch.

298
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,712
嘿,你饿了吗?
Hey, you hungry?

299
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,960
没有，我之前吃过东西了。
No, man, I had something to eat earlier.

300
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:38,420
那是一把新枪吗?
Is that a new gun?

301
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,421
哦,是的。
Oh, yeah.

302
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,515
在轮尼医院有个交易。
Got a deal on it down at Gurney's.

303
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:44,934
他说我月底前都不用给他钱。
Said I didn't have to pay him till the end of the month.

304
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,724
我的信用很好。
My credit's good.

305
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,767
这是给卢克的惊喜。
It's a surprise for Luke.

306
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,851
能给我拿瓶啤酒吗?
Would you get me a beer?

307
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,273
卡萝，你能帮我拿一个吗?
Carol, would you get me a?

308
00:26:58,492 --> 00:26:59,152
能给我拿瓶啤酒吗?
Oh, would you get me a beer?

309
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:20,052
嘿，先生，我想我们最好去拿那个油泵。
Hey, mister, I guess we'd better go and take that fuel pump.

310
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,755
那你能付得起钱吗?
Well, can you pay for it?

311
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,473
是的，我有信用卡。
I got a credit card, yeah.

312
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,014
我不打卡。
Well, I don't take cards.

313
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,636
为什么不呢，见鬼，这很好。
Why not, hell, it's good.

314
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:29,888
你可以去看看。
You can check it out.

315
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,265
他们负责拿到钱。
They're responsible for getting the money.

316
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:34,108
我们在路易斯安那州和阿拉巴马州使用过。
We used it in Louisiana, Alabama.

317
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,522
佛罗里达、密西西比。
Florida, Mississippi.

318
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,486
不，我不打卡。
No, I don't take cards.

319
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,775
我们甚至用它买了个轮胎。
We even bought a tire with it.

320
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:41,608
我跟你说，我拿过一次卡，以后就不收了
I'll tell you, I took cards once,I don't take them no more.

321
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,449
明白了吗?
You get the idea?

322
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,660
要么付现金，要么刷卡。
It's either cash or charge.

323
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,201
好吧，我们来刷卡。
All right, we'll charge it.

324
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,664
你不能刷卡。
You can't charge it.

325
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:49,908
我不知道你是谁。
I don't know who you are.

326
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,126
你得付现金。
You're just gonna have to pay cash.

327
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:53,665
多少钱?
How much is it?

328
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,460
好的，请稍等，我查查看。
Well, just a second, I'll check.

329
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,800
我们有多少钱?
How much we got?

330
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,634
我有3块，你有多少?
I got $3, how much you got?

331
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:09,640
我有四个。
I got four.

332
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:15,183
含税一共27美元。
That's, uh, $27 including tax.

333
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,568
克里斯。
Chris.

334
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:18,357
什么?
What?

335
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,357
我收到3美元。
I got $3.

336
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,233
不，没关系。
No, that's all right.

337
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,242
把枪。
Get the gun.

338
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,364
什么枪?
What gun?

339
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,784
把枪。
Get the gun.

340
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,236
你看到了吗?
You see that?

341
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,200
泵动。
Pump-action.

342
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,537
那是一把22口径的步枪。
That's a.22 caliber rifle.

343
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:17,415
现在，我们要做的是用这个换你的燃油泵。
Now, what we wanna do is trade you that for that fuel pump.

344
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,044
哦。
Oh.

345
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,088
我告诉你，我用不了a。22。
Well, I'll tell you, I got no use for a.22.

346
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,055
嘿，你有猎枪吗?
Hey, you got a shotgun?

347
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:29,970
我需要一把猎枪。
I could use a shotgun.

348
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:30,967
我来告诉你我们要做什么。
I'll tell you what we'll do.

349
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:35,221
我们跟你交换这个。22步枪和8。3美元的燃油泵。
We'll trade you this.22 rifle and that $8.30 for a fuel pump.

350
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:36,643
现在，这是一个便宜货。
Now, that's a bargain.

351
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,358
不，不，我用不了a。22。
No, no, I got no use for a.22.

352
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,696
他不是说他可以用钩子什么的暂时修好它吗?
Didn't he say he could fix it temporarily with a catch or something?

353
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:48,614
你不是这么说的吗?
Didn't you say that?

354
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,656
你说了，不是吗?
You did, didn't you?

355
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:50,949
那要花多少钱?
How much would that cost?

356
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:54,908
是啊，我花五块钱就能修好，但也不会让你跑多远。
Yeah, I could fix that for about five bucks,but it wouldn't take you very far.

357
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,786
大概20英里左右吧，我不知道。
Maybe 20 miles or so, I don't know.

358
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:01,460
看，离这里最近的车站有多远?
Look, how far is the nearest station from here?

359
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,959
这取决于你往哪个方向走。
Well, that would depend on which direction you're going in.

360
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,422
嗯，我们要往西走，但我们得先到最近的车站。
Well, we're going west, but we have to go to the nearest station first.

361
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:11,095
哦，韦斯特，让我想想。
Oh, west, well, let's see.

362
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:15,721
也许，梅肯在这里，85英里，但是。
That's probably,well, Macon's down here, 85 miles, but.

363
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,472
好吧，让我考虑一下。
Well, let me think on it a minute.

364
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,519
花你的时间。
Take your time.

365
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,484
让我看看，你走到这，然后你会摇摆
Let's see, you go down here and you'd swing around

366
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,856
哦，是的，是的，是的。
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

367
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:28,654
那里有个加油站。
They got a gas station there.

368
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,491
,在这里吗?
Where, down here?

369
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,326
不，在桑顿这里。
No, over here in Thornton.

370
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,571
它是。
It's.

371
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:33,571
是多少，40?
What is it, 40?

372
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:34,789
我觉得有40英里。
I'd say it's 40 miles.

373
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,953
有45英里，你明白吗?
It's 45 miles, you get the idea?

374
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,917
是啊，我以前也在那放过油。
Yeah, I got gas there myself once.

375
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,708
他们会收你的信用卡。
They'll take your credit card for you.

376
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:48,965
听着，去做那笔交易吧，你花5美元修理一下，你知道的，暂时的。
Look, go ahead and do that deal where you fix it for $5, you know temporarily.

377
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,722
如果你能在天黑前搞定，我们会很感激的。
We'd appreciate it if you could do that before it gets dark.

378
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:54,468
我们得离开这里，去警局。
We gotta get out of here so we can go to the station.

379
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:55,559
——当然,是的。——好吧?
- Sure, yeah. - All right?

380
00:30:55,562 --> 00:31:00,978
就算我抓对了人，也得花点时间。
Well, even if I do have the right catch,it's gonna take a little while.

381
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,649
你的洗手间在哪里?
Say, where's your restroom?

382
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:11,651
就在这里就在后面。
It's right oh, it's right around in the back here.

383
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,368
到处走走，那里有个标志。
Just swing around, there's a sign there.

384
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,362
就在招牌附近。
It's right near the sign.

385
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:15,204
在那里?
Right around there?

386
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,039
是啊，我得去看看我有没有抓到把柄。
Yeah, I gotta go see if I got the catch.

387
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:17,828
好吧。
Okay.

388
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,211
天啊，我真希望他能补上这一招。
Man, I sure hope he can fix that catch.

389
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,669
我可不想在这地方耽搁时间。
I'd hate to get hung up in this place.

390
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:34,424
天啊，你说得对。
Boy, you can say that again.

391
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,800
天啊，我真希望他能补上这一招。
Man, I sure hope he can fix that catch.

392
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,770
我可不想在这地方耽搁时间。
I'd hate to get hung up in this place.

393
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:39,558
嘘。
Boo.

394
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,856
你觉得那个女孩怎么样?
What do you think of that girl?

395
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,238
哦，她很好。
Oh, she's all right.

396
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:03,661
是的，她很好。
Yeah, she is all right.

397
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,792
你看到她多快就弄到钱了吗?
Did you see how fast she came up with that money?

398
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:10,794
她本可以一走了之的。
She could've just left, you know.

399
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:19,594
你觉得我们能和那个妞搞到一起吗?
Well, you think we're gonna score with that broad?

400
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,062
这算什么"我们"啊?
What's this we shit, huh?

401
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,432
她说你有口臭。
She said you had bad breath.

402
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:25,604
她没那么说。
She didn't say that.

403
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,475
是的,她做的。
Yeah, she did.

404
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,773
你是认真的吗?
Are you serious, huh?

405
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,066
离开这里。
Get out of here.

406
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,244
-嗨。-嗨。
- Hi. - Hi.

407
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,871
你有多余的牙刷吗?
Have you got an extra toothbrush?

408
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,669
不，我有我自己的。
No, I just got my own.

409
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:48,922
你想用吗?
You wanna use it?

410
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:49,756
嗯?
Huh?

411
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,749
你想用吗?
Do you wanna use it?

412
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,217
是的，如果可以的话。
Yeah, if it's all right.

413
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,006
确定。
Sure.

414
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,962
如果上面没有任何食物的话。
If it doesn't have any food on it.

415
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,675
——哦,克里斯?——什么?
- Oh, Chris? - What?

416
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,845
用这个可能会容易些。
Might be a little easier with this.

417
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,518
——再见。——谢谢。
- Bye. - Thank you.

418
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,230
嘿，艾达，怎么了?
Hey, Ida, what's going on?

419
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,399
里德，你这个帅呆了的混蛋。
Reed, you good-looking son of a gun.

420
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,399
你不应该把尸体吓个半死。
You're not supposed to scare a body half to death.

421
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,822
你们进来的时候弄出点声音来。
Now, make some damn noise when y'all come in.

422
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,739
声音?
Noise?

423
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,661
该死，我弄出的声音都能把死人吵醒了。
Hell, I made enough noise to wake the dead.

424
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,706
珍妮?
Jenny?

425
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,075
来了。
Coming.

426
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,672
肯定是果冻，因为果酱不会那样摇晃。
Must be jelly, because jam don't shake like that.

427
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,383
天啊，好热。
Oh, God, it's hot.

428
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:42,847
嘿。
Hey.

429
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,892
艾达，我不相信你。
Hey, Ida, I don't believe you.

430
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,435
你作弊。
You're cheating.

431
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,525
现在我知道你为什么不愿称体重了。
Now I know why you won't get on that scale.

432
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:52,896
我一看临床医学书籍就紧张。
Oh, I get nervous when I read them clinical books.

433
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:53,737
临床吗?
Clinical?

434
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,652
临床、我的屁股。
Clinical, my ass.

435
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:57,992
你只是喜欢给他们看黄书，仅此而已。
You just like reading them dirty books, that's all.

436
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,735
你知道那不是事实。
You know that ain't the truth.

437
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:06,917
我只是在生意不好的时候坐在这里  对着那个懒汉大喊大叫会很紧张。
I just get nervous sitting around here when business is slow and yelling at that lazy Hamp.

438
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,173
加满油，爸爸。
Fill it up, dad.

439
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,676
艾达，别跟我说那个但是，但是。
Hey, Ida, don't give me that but, but.

440
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:21,595
你听起来像Hamp。
You sound like Hamp.

441
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:27,764
你知道吗，事实是你根本没有你一直吹嘘的勇气。
Hey, you know, the truth of the matter is that you just ain't got all that intestinal fortitude you was always bragging about.

442
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,074
看那边。
Look over there.

443
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,617
他们比我早来多久了?
How long they been here before me?

444
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:44,909
他们三个孩子?
Them three kids?

445
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:45,952
是的。
Yep.

446
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:51,875
我猜他们是在奥吉离开的时候来的。
I guess they got here about the time that Augie left.

447
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:56,384
那一定是15分钟前的事了。
Oh, that must have been about 15 minutes ago.

448
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,214
快点起来。
Hurry it up.

449
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,359
爸，我说了快点。
Hey, dad, I said hurry it up.

450
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,569
足够了。
Enough.

451
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,652
放轻松，朗。
Take it easy, Lon.

452
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,659
快点，快点。
Come on, hurry it up.

453
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,336
我知道你需要的是啤酒。
I know what you need is a beer.

454
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,585
我不需要警察。
Well, I don't need no cops.

455
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:38,334
Hamp贷款吗?
Hamp?

456
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,051
嘿,Hamp贷款?
Hey, Hamp?

457
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:50,520
Hamp贷款!
Hamp!

458
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,059
Hamp，你在后面吗?
Hamp, are you back there?

459
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,225
是的，我在后面，在后面。
Yeah, I'm back here in the back.

460
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,063
你的车真不错。
Sure is a nice car you got there.

461
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,577
我就知道是你，里德。
I thought that was you, Reed.

462
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,952
我以为你在为明天的大日子做准备呢。
I figured you'd be getting ready for the big day tomorrow.

463
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,621
你知道，狩猎季节开始了。
Hunting season starts, you know.

464
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:12,459
我是。
I am.

465
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:15,959
我现在要去胡德的军校接卢克。
I'm on my way to pick up Luke over at military school in Hood right now.

466
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:18,378
你知道他刚当上警督吗?
Hey, you know he just made lieutenant?

467
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:21,339
在军队里，挣得最多的就是上士。
In the Army, I never made more than staff sergeant.

468
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,098
你到底在找什么?
What the hell are you looking for?

469
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,889
哦，我在找机会。
Oh, I'm looking for a catch.

470
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,852
抓，抓什么?
Catch, catch for what?

471
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:37,147
外面那辆别克车里的水泵。
A catch for that,for the water pump in that Buick outside.

472
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,152
Hamp，那不是别克，那是克莱斯勒。
Hamp, that's not a Buick, that's a Chrysler.

473
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:47,574
那我找错地方了。
I'm looking in the wrong place then.

474
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:54,619
孩子们需要的是一个新水泵。
What them kids need anyway is a new pump.

475
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:58,164
但他们没钱付钱。
But they ain't got the money to pay for it.

476
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:05,926
好吧，再见。
Yeah, well, see you.

477
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,261
是的。
Yeah.

478
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,021
有什么麻烦吗?
What's the trouble?

479
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,694
我们的燃油泵卡住了。
Our fuel pump's jammed up.

480
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:23,656
连杆在上面失灵了。
The linkage is messed up on it.

481
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,115
你们从哪来?
Where y'all from?

482
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:25,904
芝加哥。
Chicago.

483
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,159
你在这里做什么?
Well, uh, what are you doing here?

484
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,869
我们只是路过，直到我们的车抛锚了。
We were just passing through,until our car broke down.

485
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,330
一旦修好，我们就会继续前进。
Soon as we get it fixed, we'll be moving on.

486
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:41,795
如果你能影响到广场上的人，我们会很感激的。
If you got any influence on hurrying the square in there, we'd appreciate it.

487
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:45,841
是的，Hamp有时候有点慢。
Yeah, Hamp is kind of slow sometimes.

488
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:49,549
你们现在不介意给我看看你的证件吧?
Say, y'all wouldn't mind showing me some identification now, would you?

489
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,596
不。
No.

490
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,144
不，一点也不。
No, not at all.

491
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,972
我想我钓到一条会管用的鱼了。
I think I got me a catch that's gonna work.

492
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,068
你在哪里?
Where you been?

493
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,812
把它拿出来，好吗?
Take it out, will you?

494
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:05,902
谢谢你！
Thank you.

495
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,358
在新奥尔良。
Down in New Orleans.

496
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,527
是吗?
Yeah?

497
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,654
你在那儿干什么?
What were you doing there?

498
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,666
我去体检了。
I went down there to take my physical.

499
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,749
你从达拉斯吗?
You from Dallas?

500
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:17,789
是的,是的。
Yeah, yeah.

501
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,087
把你的身体吗?
Take your physical?

502
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,547
身体为了什么?
Physical for what?

503
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,258
的军队。
For the Army.

504
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,002
你被征召了吗?
Did you get drafted?

505
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,804
不,我参军。
No, I enlisted.

506
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,716
继续。
Go on.

507
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:32,766
你在开玩笑吧?
You're kidding?

508
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:34,468
不。
No.

509
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,310
你参军?
You enlisted?

510
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,099
是的。
Yeah.

511
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,306
给你。
Here you go.

512
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:42,022
告诉我，你身上带钱了吗?
Say, uh, tell me, you got some money on you?

513
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:42,814
是的,为什么?
Yeah, why?

514
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:48,900
你得给我10块，总共30块   否则你就是流浪汉。
Well, you see, you've got to have $10 a piece, 30 total or you're considered vagrants.

515
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,526
你知道那是什么，对吧?
You know what that is, don't you?

516
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,073
是的,流浪者。
Yeah, vagrants.

517
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,912
是的，我知道那是什么。
Yeah, I know what that is.

518
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,157
瞧，我们这里有条法律。
See, we got a law here.

519
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,250
你一定要有那30美元。
You got to have that $30.

520
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,210
你想给我看看吗?
You wanna show it to me?

521
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:04,923
不，我不想去。
No, I'd rather not.

522
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:08,127
我想我明白你的意思。
I think I know what you mean.

523
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:13,640
你是说你会在汉普修完车后马上离开吗?
You say you're gonna be moving on just as quick as Hamp finishes working on the car?

524
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:16,681
越快越好，好的，先生。
Just as soon as possible, yes, sir.

525
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,310
没别的理由再待下去了，是吧?
Got no reason to stick around for nothing else, do you?

526
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,352
不。
No.

527
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,190
好。
Good.

528
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:26,479
不，等修好了，我们就走，修好了就走。
No, as soon as we get it fixed,we're moving out, just as soon as we get it fixed.

529
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,446
这是真正的好。
That's real good.

530
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,781
嘿,Hamp
Hey, Hamp.

531
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:30,615
是吗?
Yeah?

532
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,484
那边，快上车。
Hurry up on the car, there.

533
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:36,197
除非万不得已，我们不想让这些人在这里待太久。
Don't wanna keep these nice folk here any longer than we have to.

534
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,415
他们可能会慢慢喜欢上的。
They might grow to like it.

535
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,915
我一点也不喜欢那样。
I wouldn't like that at all.

536
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:45,623
好,看到你。
Well, see you.

537
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:48,129
那是什么?
What was that?

538
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,260
愚蠢的乡巴佬。
Dumb hick.

539
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,325
特里?
Terry?

540
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:15,911
芦苇。
Reed.

541

这是850 - 263。
That's 850-263.

543
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:30,964

00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:35,013
嘿,比尔?
Hey, Bill?

547
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,052
嗯嗯?
Mm-hm?

548
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:39,268
里德需要马上做个调查。
Reed needs a make on this right away.

549
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:52,860
他是好的吗?
Is he okay?

550
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,161
是的，他很好。
Yeah, he's all right.

551
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,374
只是我们已经在一起很久很久了。
It's just that we've been together for a long, long time.

552
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:11,171
嘿，那边那个地方怎么样?
Hey, how about that place there?

553
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,299
它和其他的一样好。
It's as good as any.

554
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,613
让我们得到它。

555
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,321

嘿，让我看看你。

562
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:42,512
那些警督酒吧看起来真不错。
Those lieutenant bars really look good.

563
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:45,010
你让你妈妈和我都为你骄傲。
You made your mom and me mighty proud.

564
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:47,308
嘿，明天和我一起去打猎怎么样?
Hey, how about going hunting with me tomorrow?

565
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:49,181
我一定要去吗，爸爸?
Do I have to go, dad?

566
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:51,730
我还想做些别的事。
There were some other things I wanted to do.

567

不，你不必去，孩子 我很想和你待一会儿。
No, you don't have to go, boy but I sure would like to spend some time with you.

568
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:03,661
你知道吗，自从你来这里上学我们就没怎么在一起过，都没时间说话。
You know, since you've been going to school here we haven't been together too much,haven't had any time to talk.

569
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:08,284
我也想去，但我想和海盗们一起打球。
I'd like to go, but I wanna play ball with the Pirates.

570
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,581
他们是杰夫·戴维斯家的几个孩子。
They're some of the kids from Jeff Davis.

571
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:13,585
他们要我加入他们的队伍，我答应了。
They asked me to be on their team and I said I would.

572
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,583
好吧，如果你答应过。
Well, if you promised.

573
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,301
是的，爸爸，真的。
I did, dad, honest.

574
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:22,798
卢克，你觉得他们会介意你不去吗?
Hey, Luke, do you think they'd mind very much if you didn't?

575
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:29,229
不，孩子，你去跟他们玩吧。
No, son, you go ahead and play with them.

576
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,690
我们下周末去打猎。

577
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,695
谢谢，爸爸，他们真的很需要我。

我是个好击球手。

579
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,659
嘿，你和妈妈为什么不来看比赛呢?
Hey, why don't you and Mom come to the game?

580
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:44,619
我想妈妈不会去的。
I don't think Mom would go.

581
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,955
你知道她有多担心你。
You know how she worries about you.

582
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:49,200
她甚至不想让我明天带你去打猎。
She didn't even want me to take you hunting tomorrow.

583
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,497
或者任何一天都可以。
Or any day, for that matter.

584
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:53,461
哦,男孩。
Oh, boy.

585
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:57,503
Luke?
Luke?

586
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,257
来吧，我们回家吧。
Come on, let's go home.

587
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:07,476
下周见，詹姆斯。
See you next week, James.

588
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,886
再见,Luke。
See you, Luke.

589
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,142
再见,查尔斯。
Bye, Charles.

590
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:24,451
<我>你没有体面的感觉吗? < / i >
<i>Have you left no sense of decency?</i>

591
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,530
我知道这伤害了你，韦尔奇先生
<i>I know this hurts you, Mr. Welch.</i>

592
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,827
<i>参议员，我想这也伤害了你，先生
<i>Senator, I think it hurts you too, sir.</i>

593
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,120
<i> 我想把这个做完。
<i>I'd like to finish this.</i>

594
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:37,209
他每天都在说  他想在日落前把任何被共产主义玷污的人赶出去。
He's been talking day after day about the way he wants to get anyone tainted with communism out before sundown.

595
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:47,974
军队与麦卡锡的争议  今天爆发了新的耸人听闻的指控和否认，涉及到艾森豪威尔政府的另一位高级官员。
The Army-McCarthy controversy erupted today with new sensational charges and denials involving another high official of the Eisenhower administration.

596
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:54,898
这么多天来，一直在党团会议大厅为约瑟夫·麦卡锡参议员鼓掌的人群突然沉默下来。
The crowds that had long applauded senator Joseph McCarthy in the Caucus Room for so many days were suddenly silent.

597
00:44:54,901 --> 00:45:00,772
他们似乎有了一个新的英雄，也叫乔.约瑟夫·韦尔奇。
They seem to have acquired a new hero,also named Joe. Joseph Welch.

598
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:01,855
韦尔奇先生
<i>Mr. Welch.</i>

599
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,951
不，不，不，别吵。
No, no, no, don't make a noise.

600
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,615
<i>Had been针刺他…</i>
<i>Had been needling him...</i>

601
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:09,113
嗨,妈妈。
Hi, Momma.

602
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:11,619
如果你不发出声音，我们就不会伤害你。
We ain't gonna hurt you if you don't make no noise.

603
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,627
我们只是来拿点东西。
We just came to take a few things.

604
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:18,623
<i>证人在麦卡锡面前的声音
<i>Witnesses had sounded in front of McCarthy.</i>

605
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:20,625
韦尔奇进门时，麦卡锡开始局促不安
<i>As Welch bore in, McCarthy began squirming.</i>

606
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:21,466
你看到了什么?
You see?

607
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:23,836
他的助手接受了他所享受的惩罚
<i>His aide took the punishment he enjoyed.</i>

608
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,462
那是我的朋友。
That's my friend over here.

609
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:29,387
韦尔奇成为了一名特别军事顾问，这是众所周知的事。
It was common knowledge that Mr. Welch became a special Army counsel.

610
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,811
他曾考虑聘请年轻的律师弗雷德·费希尔。
He had considered using the young attorney named Fred Fisher.

611
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:35,181
然而,<我>学习。< / i >
<i>Learning, however.</i>

612
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:38,605
朗，你说得对，周围没人。
Lon, you're right, there ain't nobody around.

613
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:42,938
<我>韦尔奇,让更多。< / i >
<i>Welch, toward making additional.</i>

614
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:47,280
我要把你带回去，绑在房间里，这样你就不会弄出太多噪音。
I'm gonna take you back and tie you up in the room,just so you don't make a lot of noise.

615
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:50,324
你别动，我们不会伤害你的。
You stay still and we won't hurt you at all.

616
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,497
来吧,妈妈。
Come on, Momma.

617
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:55,538
来吧。
Come on.

618
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:01,252
-求你了-没事的妈妈
- Please - No, it's all right, Momma.

619
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,719
只是坐下来。
Just sit down.

620
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:16,688
我要把你绑起来。
I'm gonna tie you up.

621
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:37,181
那是你爸爸吗，妈妈?
That your old man, Momma?

622
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,062
你老爸是警察?
Your old man a cop?

623
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,738
他是个大男人，对吧，妈妈?
He's a big man, huh, Momma?

624
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,371
他一周给你几次，妈妈?
How many times a week does he give it to you, Momma?

625
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:02,418
他是自己拿的还是自己要的，妈妈?
Does he take it from you or does he ask you for it, Momma?

626
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,088
请
Please

627
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,968
嘿，需要男人吗，妈妈?
Hey, need a man, Momma?

628
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:18,639
不!
No!

629
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:08,815
它在我们身上。
It's pegging on us.

630
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:13,274
他说至少能开20英里。
He said it'd get at least 20 miles.

631
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:14,115
嗯,差不多。
Well, almost.

632
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:16,201
我们只差10英里了。
Hell, we're only 10 miles short.

633
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:17,739
他已经尽力了。
Well, hell, he did the best he could.

634
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:20,363
他花了大约五个小时。
He worked on it for about five hours.

635
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:23,246
唯一的问题是他的智商只有八。
The only problem was he had an IQ of about eight.

636
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:25,581
你好,阳光。
Hello, sunshine.

637
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,079
你睡了吗?
Did you sleep?

638
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:29,961
是的，有一点。
Yeah, a little bit.

639
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:34,010
这辆车怎么了?
What's the matter with the car?

640
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:35,629
这是胡来了。
It's crapping out.

641
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,681
就这样了，伙计，我们买下来了。
Well, that's it, man, we bought it.

642
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:44,896
不会再继续下去了。
It's not going any further.

643
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:50,234
我来告诉你我是干什么的。
I'll tell you what I'm for.

644
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,478
睡一觉，明天再考虑吧。
Get some sleep and worry about it tomorrow.

645
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:53,905
现在我们也无能为力了。
There's nothing we can do about it now anyways.

646
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:55,865
我想你是对的。
I think you're right.

647
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:59,827
明天早上我们搭便车去桑顿拿个燃油泵自己把它接上。
Tomorrow morning we'll hitch a ride to Thornton get a fuel pump and hook it up ourselves.

648
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:01,826
你能做到，不是吗?
You can do that, can't you?

649
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:06,668
我不知道，如果我有合适的工具，我可能会，我不知道。
I don't know, if I had the right tools,I might be able to, I don't know.

650
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,411
什么意思，如果你有工具?
What do you mean, if you had the tools?

651
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,709
什么，你要被哄着吗?
What, you gotta be coaxed?

652
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:11,752
这和被哄骗无关。
It has nothing to do with being coaxed.

653
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,004
我只是不知道我能不能做到。
I just don't know if I can do it.

654
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,045
如果你不。
If you don't.

655
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,096
如果你不解决，我们就会陷入困境。
If you don't fix it, we're stuck.

656
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:23,886
现在，我只想睡个好觉。
Right now, all I care about is getting some sleep.

657
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,720
我们可以明天再担心。
We can worry about it tomorrow.

658
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,856
也许车会被拖走——我们根本就不用担心了。
Maybe the car will get towed off we won't have to worry about it at all.

659
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:32,978
我们要让珍妮伸出她的腿，好让我们搭便车。
We'll get Jenny out there to stick out her leg so we can hitchhike.

660
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,159
那样我们就没人骑了。
We wouldn't get any rides that way.

661
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:49,582
我想说的是，如果我们不修好它，我们就会被困住。
All that I'm saying is,if we don't get it fixed, we're stuck.

662
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,499
这就是我要说的。
That's all I'm saying.

663
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:51,337
好了,我们被困住了。
Okay, we're stuck.

664
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,707
我他妈该怎么做?
What the hell am I supposed to do about it?

665
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,505
那我们睡会儿吧，好吗?
Let's get some sleep then, okay?

666
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:00,138
这辆车归我。
Dibs on the car.

667
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:05,639
不，我们得找个地方睡觉。
No, we gotta look for a place to sleep.

668
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:06,853
好。
Good.

669
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:27,926
我们应该做的是在车上留个便条以防警长来过这里。
You know, what we ought to do is put a note on the car in case that sheriff came by here.

670
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,222
你不觉得吗?
Don't you think?

671
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,269
韦恩?
Well, Wayne?

672
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:40,147
好吧，我会的。
All right, I'll do it.

673
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,364
什么?
What?

674
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,868
我说过我会做的。
I said I'd do it.

675
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:52,367
我告诉你吧。
I'll tell you what.

676
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:54,665
你们俩解决我们的问题。
You two solve our problem.

677
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:57,460
我要去车里睡觉了。
I'm gonna go sleep in the car.

678
00:52:57,466 --> 00:52:59,082
晚安,韦恩。
Good night, Wayne.

679
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,762
(他为什么这么不高兴?)
What's he so upset about?

680
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:05,972
我不知道。
I don't know.

681
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,933
可能是因为只有一个女孩。
It's probably because there's just one girl.

682
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:28,157
到这里来。
Come here.

683
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:55,472
你还没告诉我们你为什么要去达拉斯。
You never did tell us why you were going to Dallas.

684
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:07,150
我在这家酒吧工作，他们发现我未成年。
Well, I was working in this bar and they found out I was underage.

685
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,157
他们怎么知道的?
How'd they find that out?

686
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:19,162
我有一个室友，我们经常在一起聊天，有天晚上我们交换了生活中的故事。
I had a roommate and we talked a lot together and one night we exchanged life stories.

687
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:27,296
酒吧的经理是她的男朋友。
See, the manager of the bar was her boyfriend.

688
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:29,847
哦。
Oh.

689
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:30,636
,嗯。
And, uh.

690
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:35,811
他看我的次数开始多于看她的次数。
He kind of started looking at me more than he did her.

691
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:40,980
总之，有一晚他跟我调情。
Anyway, one night,one night he made a pass at me.

692
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,402
,嗯。
And, uh.

693
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:50,448
不知怎么的，她发现了。
Somehow she found out about it.

694
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:54,372
我不知道，也许他已经告诉她了。
I don't know, maybe he even told her.

695
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:58,914
有趣的是你从没告诉过我  你为什么要去达拉斯。
You know, what's funny is you never did tell me why you were going to Dallas.

696
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,583
这有关系吗?
Look, does it matter?

697
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,587
不，没关系。
No, it doesn't matter.

698
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:11,305
那为什么还要问?
Well, then why ask?

699
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,928
我很感兴趣，好奇或者。
I was interested or curious or.

700
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:17,474
见鬼，我也不知道。
Hell, I don't know.

701
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:26,191
儿子吗?
Son?

702
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:27,188
是的,先生?
Yes, sir?

703
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:29,694
你还记得我们离开学校时你向他招手的那个男孩吗?
You know that boy you waved to back there as we left school?

704
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:31,693
是的，先生，他叫詹姆斯。
Yes, sir, his name's James.

705
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:32,568
你怎么认识他的，孩子?
How do you know him, son?

706
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,037
他不上你们学校，是吗?
He doesn't go to your school, does he?

707
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:42,746
嗯，有一天自习结束后，我有一些空闲时间，所以我去了篮球场，他们在那里。
Well, one day after study hall,I had some free time so I went to use the basketball court and there they were.

708
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:47,342
我们选了队，到目前为止，我们队在10场比赛中赢了7场。
We chose up teams, and so far my team's won seven out of 10 games.

709
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:49,131
但我觉得学校不希望他们去。
But I don't think the school wants them there.

710
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:52,346
他们已经跑了好几次了。
They've been run off a couple of times.

711
00:55:56,353 --> 00:56:02,102
你知道在学校你必须遵守规章制度吗?
You know how in school you have rules and laws that you have to follow?

712
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:04,271
就像你要遵守法律一样。
Just like you have laws to follow.

713
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:05,610
正确的。
Right.

714
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:06,398
好。
Well.

715
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:10,239
在萨特，他们只是。
At Sutter, they just.

716
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:12,484
他们只是不接受黑人，仅此而已。
They just don't take blacks, that's all.

717
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:16,112
不是因为他们没钱，而是他们不收钱。
Not because they don't have the money,but they just don't take them.

718
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:19,082
但是，爸爸，这好像不对。
But, dad, that doesn't seem right.

719
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:25,877
学校认为黑人应该和其他黑人一起上学   白人应该和其他白人一起上学，孩子。
The school feels that blacks should go to school with other blacks and whites should go with other whites, son.

720
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,879
这样事情就简单多了。
It just seems to make things a whole lot easier.

721
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,386
你妈妈和我也是这么想的。
Your mom and I feel the same way.

722
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:42,055
那是不是意味着我不能再和他们一起打篮球了?
Does that mean I can't play basketball with them anymore?

723
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:46,025
我希望你不要。
I wish you wouldn't.

724
00:56:47,446 --> 00:56:48,482
好吧?——好的。
Okay? - Okay.

725
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:53,278
谢谢。
Thanks.

726
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:55,572
非常感谢。
Thanks a lot.

727
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,403
你看看，好吗?
Look at that, will you?

728
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:28,247
我想我最好让他们靠边停车  告诉他们把灯修好  免得他们屁股被撞坏了。
I think I'd better have them pull over and tell them to get their lights fixed before their ass-end gets bashed in.

729
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,120
哦,狗屎。
Oh, shit.

730
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,880
我们穿这玩意跑不过他们。
We can't outrun them in this thing.

731
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:45,052
我要靠边停车。
I'm gonna pull over.

732
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:50,679
不要这样做。
Don't do it.

733
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,356
不要崩溃。
Don't you fall apart.

734
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:05,151
闭上你的嘴。
Just keep your mouth shut.

735
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:12,784
-你好。-嗨。
- Howdy. - Hi.

736
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:13,659
我看见你开车经过。
I seen you drive by.

737
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,956
我注意到你的尾灯坏了。
I noticed your taillights were out.

738
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:16,829
不想让别人撞见你。
Didn't want nobody to run into you.

739
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,877
该死，他们一定是出去了。
Damn they must have just gone out.

740
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:21,758
我们在路上加油的时候他们正在工作。
They were working when we got gas back down the road.

741
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:23,047
好的，我会把它们修好的。
Well, I'll get them fixed.

742
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:24,636
是啊，我要是你就这么做。
Yeah, I'd do that if I were you.

743
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:26,471
不想让你们都受伤。
Don't want y'all to get hurt.

744
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:29,137
你会发现六英里外有个车站。
Now, you'll find a station about six miles.

745
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:31,056
一直沿着高速公路走。
Just keep following the highway.

746
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:31,927
嘿,比尔,
Hey, Bill,

747
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:35,773
看看后座上的这些东西。
look at this stuff here in the back seat.

748
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:38,313
好了，你们都下车。
All right, you guys, get out of the car.

749
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:49,028
——我们死了。——继续开车。
- We're dead. - Keep driving.

750
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:51,656
<i>36号车，代码10
<i>Car 36, code 10.</i>

751
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:53,373
<我>重复、代码10。< / i >
<i>Repeat, code 10.</i>

752
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:59,706
我正在追踪一辆新款史蒂贝克车  在特纳路209号路口向北行驶。
I'm in pursuit of a late-model Studebaker heading north on Turner Road near Junction 209.

753
01:01:59,925 --> 01:02:02,417
所有单位请回复10号代码。
All available units respond to code 10.

754
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:14,137
我知道他们会抓到我们的。
I know they're gonna get us.

755
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,389
来吧，开车。
Come on and drive.

756
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:17,435
我们死了。
We're dead.

朗。

758
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:40,834
你来吧。
You come on.

759
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:42,460
你开车像个女人。
You're driving like a woman.

760
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:47,757
我们会成功的。
We're gonna make it.

761
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,596
不，我们不会的。
No, we ain't gonna.

762
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,012
我们不会，我知道，我看得出来。
We're not gonna, I know, I can see.

763
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:54,476
别再让他们抓到我了。
Don't let them get me again.

764
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:02,852
你别再哭哭啼啼地开车了。
You quit sniveling and drive.

765
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:06,568
天啊，如果他抓到我，我就杀了你。
Oh, boy, if he catches me, I'm gonna kill you.

766
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:08,531
当心那辆卡车!
Look out for that truck!

767
01:04:33,912 --> 01:04:34,698
Luke?
Luke?

768
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:36,491
Luke?
Luke?

769
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:39,664
Luke?
Luke?

770
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:41,078
嗨,Luke。
Hey, Luke.

771
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:42,785
你没事吧，孩子，醒醒。
You all right, boy, wake up.

772
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:44,499
卢克。
Luke.

773
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:47,210
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

774
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:50,130
是的，我只是做了个梦，爸爸。
Yeah, I was only having a dream, dad.

775
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:52,674
好吧，你让我担心了。
Oh, okay, you had me worried.

776
01:04:56,184 --> 01:04:58,141
-比尔，我想和你谈谈-威廉姆斯先生
- Bill, I wanna talk - Mr. Williams.

777
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:01,721
我的搭档有妻子和两个孩子  我刚跟他们谈过。
My partner had a wife and two kids and I just got done talking to them.

778
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:07,439
但我是法庭指派来维护这些人的权利的  他们有权见自己的律师。
But I'm appointed by the court to defend these people's rights and they have a right to see their attorney.

779
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:09,107
我什么时候可以看?
When can I see them?

780
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:11,902
-等我准备好了。——比尔。
- When I'm good and ready. - Bill.

781
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:21,582
把你的脚从桌子上拿开。
Get your foot off the table.

782
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,748
好了，把手铐解开。
All right, take the cuffs off this garbage.

783
01:05:37,976 --> 01:05:41,515
恰克，出去喝杯咖啡。
Chuck, go out and get yourself some coffee.

784
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,153
好吧，签了这些文件。
Okay, sign these papers.

785
01:05:58,538 --> 01:05:59,403
对什么?
What for?

786
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:02,031
对什么?
What for?

787
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:05,584
这些是被你这人渣杀的警察的招供。
These are confessions for the cop you scum killed.

788
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,539
我不会认罪的。
I ain't signing no confession.

789
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:13,964
爸，我想和公设辩护律师谈谈。
Hey, dad, I wanna talk to the public defender.

790
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:17,429
你签了供词就能见到他了。
You'll see him after you sign these confessions.

791
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:18,548
现在签字。
Now sign them.

792
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:21,134
现在签字。
Now sign them.

793
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:26,688
我不会认罪的。
I ain't signing no confession.

794
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:28,648
我们知道我们的权利。
We know what our rights are.

795
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:29,482
废话。
Bullshit.

796
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:32,194
在我看来，你没有任何权利。
You ain't got no rights as far as I'm concerned.

797
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:33,313
现在开始吧。
Now get to it.

798
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:39,652
我什么都不会签的。
I ain't signing nothing.

799
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:47,744
把你的手放在桌子上。
Put your hands on the table.

800
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:50,708
对什么?
What for?

801
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:59,631
我说，把手放在桌子上。
I said, put your hands on the table.

802
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:04,890
平，你个混蛋，平。
Flat, you son of a bitch, flat.

803
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:13,357
现在你是右撇子还是左撇子?
Now you right-handed or left-handed?

804
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:16,484
我是右撇子。
I'm right-handed.

805
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:30,332
现在，要么你开始写作，要么你马上就会变成左撇子。
Now, either you start writing or you're gonna become left-handed immediately.

806
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:31,624
等一下。
Wait a minute.

807
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:33,793
嘿,男人。
Hey, man.

808
01:07:34,842 --> 01:07:35,628
