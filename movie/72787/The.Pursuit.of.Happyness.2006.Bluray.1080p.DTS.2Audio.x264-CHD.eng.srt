1
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,300
Time to get up, man.

2
00:01:39,137 --> 00:01:41,435
- All right, Dad.    - Come on.

3
00:02:49,274 --> 00:02:51,139
Should be here soon.

4
00:03:38,623 --> 00:03:40,784
- I think I should make a list.    - What do mean?

5
00:03:40,992 --> 00:03:43,392
- For your birthday gifts?    - Yeah.

6
00:03:43,595 --> 00:03:46,120
You know you're only getting a couple of things, right?

7
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:50,392
Yeah, I know. Just to look at and study so I can choose better.

8
00:03:50,602 --> 00:03:53,537
Okay, well, that's smart. Yeah, make a list.

9
00:03:54,038 --> 00:03:55,938
Can you spell everything you're thinking of?

10
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,735
- I think so.    - All right. That's good.

11
00:04:03,681 --> 00:04:06,582
- How you doing in here, man?    - Okay.

12
00:04:13,825 --> 00:04:16,794
Can we go to the park today, after?

13
00:04:17,595 --> 00:04:21,053
No, I gotta go to Oakland. Well, maybe, we'll see.

14
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:22,824
Give me a kiss.

15
00:04:23,701 --> 00:04:25,601
I'll talk to you later.

16
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:30,702
Excuse me.

17
00:04:31,476 --> 00:04:33,205
Oh, excuse me...

18
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:35,675
...when is somebody gonna clean this off?

19
00:04:38,683 --> 00:04:41,243
And the Y? The Y. We talked about this.

20
00:04:41,452 --> 00:04:44,853
It's an I in "happiness." There's no Y in "happiness." It's an I.

21
00:04:47,158 --> 00:04:49,023
I'm Chris Gardner.

22
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,554
I met my father for the first time when I was 28 years old.

23
00:04:53,331 --> 00:04:54,992
And I made up my mind as a young kid...

24
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,723
...that when I had children...

25
00:04:56,935 --> 00:05:00,268
...my children were gonna know who their father was.

26
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,904
This is part of my life story.

27
00:05:05,677 --> 00:05:09,078
This part is called "Riding the Bus."

28
00:05:15,553 --> 00:05:17,214
What's that?

29
00:05:17,822 --> 00:05:20,052
It's a time machine, isn't it?

30
00:05:20,858 --> 00:05:22,450
Seems like a time machine.

31
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,754
That seems like a time machine. It's a time machine. Take me with you.

32
00:05:25,964 --> 00:05:27,158
This machine...

33
00:05:27,632 --> 00:05:28,860
...this machine on my lap...

34
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:31,035
This guy, he has a time machine.

35
00:05:31,235 --> 00:05:34,295
He travels in the past with this machine and...

36
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:36,735
- it is not a time machine.

37
00:05:37,308 --> 00:05:39,902
It' a portable bone-density scanner.

38
00:05:40,745 --> 00:05:43,373
A medical device I sell for a living.

39
00:05:43,581 --> 00:05:46,072
Thank you for the opportunity to discuss it with you.

40
00:05:46,284 --> 00:05:48,377
- I appreciate it.    - We just don't need it, Chris.

41
00:05:48,586 --> 00:05:50,349
It's unnecessary and expensive.

42
00:05:50,555 --> 00:05:52,682
- Well, maybe next...    - Thank you.

43
00:05:53,758 --> 00:05:58,855
It gave a slightly denser picture than an x-ray for twice the money.

44
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:03,458
- Hey.    - Hey, baby.

45
00:06:03,668 --> 00:06:05,329
- What happened?    - No, nothing.

46
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:07,094
Look, I can't get Christopher today.

47
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,834
Oh, no, you don't, Chris. I'm back on at 7.

48
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,770
I know. I have got to go to Oakland.

49
00:06:12,243 --> 00:06:15,144
So I gotta get Christopher home, feed him, bathe him...

50
00:06:15,346 --> 00:06:17,940
...get him in bed, and be back here by 7?

51
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:20,276
- Yes.    - And we got the tax-bill notice today.

52
00:06:20,485 --> 00:06:24,012
- What are you gonna do about that?    - Look, this is what we gotta do.

53
00:06:28,326 --> 00:06:32,524
You see that car? The one with the pretty yellow shoe on it?

54
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,095
That' mine.

55
00:06:34,298 --> 00:06:36,266
There' no parking near hospitals.

56
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:38,958
That' what happens when you're always in a rush.

57
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,070
Thanks anyway. Very much.

58
00:06:41,272 --> 00:06:44,207
- Maybe next quarter.    - It's possible.

59
00:06:45,076 --> 00:06:50,605
I needed to sell at least two scanners a month for rent and daycare.

60
00:06:51,482 --> 00:06:52,847
I'd have to sell one more...

61
00:06:53,051 --> 00:06:56,817
...to pay off all of those tickets under my windshield wiper.

62
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:05,619
The problem is...

63
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:09,022
...I haven't sold any for a while.

64
00:07:10,702 --> 00:07:13,398
Since when do you not like macaroni and cheese?

65
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:16,129
Since birth?

66
00:07:18,609 --> 00:07:20,634
- What's that?    - What?

67
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:23,939
- What is this?    - It's a gift for Christopher.

68
00:07:24,148 --> 00:07:26,639
- From who?    - Cynthia from work.

69
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:29,945
It's for adults. Chris can't use it. She didn't know.

70
00:07:30,154 --> 00:07:32,145
What are you supposed to do with it?

71
00:07:32,857 --> 00:07:35,951
Make every side the same color.

72
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:39,526
Did you pay the taxes?

73
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:42,959
No, I'm gonna have to file an extension.

74
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:47,899
- You already filed an extension.    - Yeah, well, I gotta file another one.

75
00:07:48,272 --> 00:07:51,969
That's... It's $650. I'll have it in the next month.

76
00:07:52,477 --> 00:07:54,308
That means interest, right?

77
00:07:54,512 --> 00:07:56,878
- And a penalty?    - Yeah, a little bit.

78
00:07:57,081 --> 00:08:02,713
Look, why don't you let me do this? All right, just relax. Okay?

79
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,084
- Come here. Calm down.    - I have to go back to work.

80
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:18,728
Let's get ready for bed. Hey, put your plate in the sink.

81
00:08:19,437 --> 00:08:22,372
A few days ago I was presented with a report I'd asked for...

82
00:08:22,573 --> 00:08:26,304
...a comprehensive audit, if you will, of our economic condition.

83
00:08:26,978 --> 00:08:29,708
You won't like it. I didn't like it.

84
00:08:29,914 --> 00:08:31,575
But we have to face the truth...

85
00:08:31,783 --> 00:08:34,411
...and then go to work to turn things around.

86
00:08:34,619 --> 00:08:38,385
And make no mistake about it, we can turn them around.

87
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:41,683
The federal budget is out of control.

88
00:08:41,893 --> 00:08:45,260
And we face runaway deficits of almost $80 billion...

89
00:08:45,463 --> 00:08:48,899
...for this budget year that ends September 30th.

90
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,333
That deficit is larger than the entire federal budget in 1957.

91
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:57,099
And so is the almost $80 billion...

92
00:08:57,308 --> 00:09:01,608
...we will pay in interest this year on the national debt.

93
00:09:02,246 --> 00:09:04,771
Twenty years ago, in 1960...

94
00:09:04,982 --> 00:09:09,146
...our federal government payroll was less than $ 13 billion.

95
00:09:09,353 --> 00:09:12,049
Today it is 75 billion.

96
00:09:12,256 --> 00:09:17,819
During these 20 years, our population has only increased by 23.3 percent...

97
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,744
Man, I got two questions for you:

98
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,078
What do you do? And how do you do it?

99
00:09:43,588 --> 00:09:46,682
- I'm a stockbroker.    - Stockbroker. Oh, goodness.

100
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:48,859
Had to go to college to be a stockbroker, huh?

101
00:09:49,126 --> 00:09:52,823
You don't have to. Have to be good with numbers and good with people.

102
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,430
- That's it.    - Hey, you take care.

103
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:57,692
I'll let you hang on to my car for the weekend.

104
00:09:57,902 --> 00:10:00,370
- But I need it back for Monday.    - Feed the meter.

105
00:10:07,545 --> 00:10:09,945
I still remember that moment.

106
00:10:14,218 --> 00:10:18,882
They all looked so damn happy to me.

107
00:10:26,063 --> 00:10:28,463
Why couldn't I look like that?

108
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,415
I'm gonna try to get home by 6.

109
00:10:47,618 --> 00:10:50,746
I'm gonna stop by a brokerage firm after work.

110
00:10:50,955 --> 00:10:54,220
- For what?    - I wanna see about a job there.

111
00:10:54,425 --> 00:10:57,053
Yeah? What job?

112
00:10:57,561 --> 00:10:59,586
You know, when l...

113
00:10:59,797 --> 00:11:02,425
When I was a kid, I could go through a math book in a week.

114
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:05,966
So I'm gonna go see about what job they got down there.

115
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:09,005
What job?

116
00:11:11,976 --> 00:11:13,705
Stockbroker.

117
00:11:16,013 --> 00:11:19,210
- Stockbroker?    - Yeah.

118
00:11:19,617 --> 00:11:21,608
Not an astronaut?

119
00:11:38,602 --> 00:11:40,092
Don't talk to me like that, Linda.

120
00:11:41,238 --> 00:11:45,038
I'm gonna go down and see about this, and I'm gonna do it during the day.

121
00:11:45,242 --> 00:11:46,937
You should probably do your sales calls.

122
00:11:47,411 --> 00:11:49,845
I don't need you to tell me about my sales calls, Linda.

123
00:11:50,047 --> 00:11:53,244
I got three of them before the damn office is even open.

124
00:11:53,784 --> 00:11:56,218
Do you remember that rent is due next week?

125
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,285
Probably not.

126
00:11:58,923 --> 00:12:00,982
We're already two months behind.

127
00:12:01,192 --> 00:12:04,218
Next week we'll owe three months.

128
00:12:04,695 --> 00:12:08,825
I've been pulling double shifts for four months now, Chris.

129
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:13,533
Just sell what's in your contract. Get us out of that business.

130
00:12:13,738 --> 00:12:17,435
Linda, that is what I am trying to do.

131
00:12:18,175 --> 00:12:20,871
This is what I'm trying to do for my family...

132
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:22,443
...for you and for Christopher.

133
00:12:23,881 --> 00:12:25,974
What's the matter with you?

134
00:12:30,154 --> 00:12:31,849
Linda.

135
00:12:32,423 --> 00:12:33,947
Linda.

136
00:13:00,951 --> 00:13:06,048
This part of my life is called "Being Stupid."

137
00:13:08,092 --> 00:13:09,389
Can I ask you a favor, miss?

138
00:13:09,593 --> 00:13:13,461
Do you mind if I leave this here with you just for five minutes?

139
00:13:13,664 --> 00:13:16,155
I have a meeting in there and I don't wanna carry that...

140
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:18,392
...Iooking smalltime.

141
00:13:19,203 --> 00:13:23,663
Here is a dollar and I'll give you more money when I come back out.

142
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:27,139
Okay? It's not valuable. You can't sell it anywhere.

143
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,243
I can't even sell it, and it's my job. All right?

144
00:13:39,924 --> 00:13:42,290
- Chris? Tim Brophy, Resources.    - Yes. How are you?

145
00:13:42,493 --> 00:13:43,824
- Come with me.    - Yes, sir.

146
00:13:44,028 --> 00:13:46,792
Let me see if I can find you an application for our internship.

147
00:13:46,997 --> 00:13:50,228
I'm afraid that's all we can do for you. See, this is a satellite office.

148
00:13:50,434 --> 00:13:53,096
Jay Twistle in the main office, he oversees Witter Resources.

149
00:13:53,304 --> 00:13:55,397
I mean, I'm... You know, I'm just this office.

150
00:13:55,606 --> 00:13:58,541
As you can see, we got a hell of lot of applications here, so...

151
00:13:58,742 --> 00:14:01,768
Normally I have a resume sheet, but I can't seem to find it anywhere.

152
00:14:01,979 --> 00:14:05,380
- We...    - Thank you very much.

153
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:06,743
I need to go.

154
00:14:07,351 --> 00:14:09,046
I'll bring this back.

155
00:14:09,286 --> 00:14:12,414
- Thank you.    - Okay.

156
00:14:18,796 --> 00:14:23,290
Trusting a hippie girl with my scanner. Why did I do that?

157
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:25,128
Excuse me. Excuse me.

158
00:14:25,336 --> 00:14:30,774
Like I said, this part of my life is called "Being Stupid."

159
00:14:33,944 --> 00:14:38,677
Hey! Hey! Hey! Don't move! Don't move! Stay...!

160
00:14:46,624 --> 00:14:48,990
Stop! Stop!

161
00:14:49,193 --> 00:14:52,390
Don't move! Stop this...! Stop the train!

162
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,728
Stop! Stop!

163
00:15:10,648 --> 00:15:14,379
The program took just 20 people every six months.

164
00:15:14,585 --> 00:15:16,678
One got the job.

165
00:15:18,222 --> 00:15:23,592
There were three blank lines after "high school" to list more education.

166
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:27,927
I didn't need that many lines.

167
00:15:33,003 --> 00:15:35,995
Try and sleep. It's late.

168
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:49,578
It' a puzzle measuring just 3 inches by 3 inches on each side...

169
00:15:49,787 --> 00:15:52,221
...made up of multiple colors that you twist and turn...

170
00:15:52,423 --> 00:15:55,017
...and try to get to a solid color on each side.

171
00:15:55,226 --> 00:15:58,855
This little cube is the gift sensation of 1981.

172
00:15:59,063 --> 00:16:00,462
Don't expect to solve it easily.

173
00:16:00,664 --> 00:16:03,098
Although we did encounter one math professor at USF...

174
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,791
...who took just 30 minutes on his.

175
00:16:06,003 --> 00:16:08,233
This is as far as I've gotten on mine.

176
00:16:08,439 --> 00:16:11,806
As you can see, I still have a long way to go.

177
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:14,637
This is Jim Finnerty reporting for KJSF in Richmond.

178
00:16:14,845 --> 00:16:17,541
Hey, wake up.

179
00:16:17,748 --> 00:16:19,272
Eat.

180
00:16:20,384 --> 00:16:22,852
- Bye, Mom.    - Bye, baby.

181
00:16:23,053 --> 00:16:26,045
- Come back without that, please.    - Oh, yeah, I'm going to.

182
00:16:26,257 --> 00:16:29,192
So go ahead, say goodbye to it, because I'm coming back without it.

183
00:16:29,393 --> 00:16:31,827
Goodbye and good riddance.

184
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:33,997
You ain't had to add the "good riddance" part.

185
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:35,256
Bye, Mom.

186
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:38,132
Bye.

187
00:16:38,335 --> 00:16:41,930
It's written as P-P-Y, but it's supposed to be an I in "happiness."

188
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:45,267
- Is it an adjective?    - No, actually it's a noun.

189
00:16:45,476 --> 00:16:47,205
But it's not spelled right.

190
00:16:47,411 --> 00:16:51,006
- Is "fuck" spelled right?    - Yeah, that's spelled right.

191
00:16:51,215 --> 00:16:54,343
But that's not part of the motto, so you're not supposed to learn that.

192
00:16:54,551 --> 00:16:59,454
That's an adult word to show anger and other things.

193
00:16:59,657 --> 00:17:02,524
- But just don't use that one, okay?    - Okay.

194
00:17:02,726 --> 00:17:04,887
What's that say on the back of your bag?

195
00:17:05,229 --> 00:17:07,197
My nickname.

196
00:17:07,398 --> 00:17:08,990
We pick nicknames.

197
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,566
- Oh, yeah? What's it say?    - "Hot Rod."

198
00:17:15,572 --> 00:17:17,597
- Did you have a nickname?    - Yep.

199
00:17:17,808 --> 00:17:20,538
- What?    - "Ten-Gallon Head."

200
00:17:20,744 --> 00:17:23,645
- What's that?    - I grew up in Louisiana, near Texas.

201
00:17:23,847 --> 00:17:28,477
Everybody wears cowboy hats. And a ten-gallors a big hat.

202
00:17:28,686 --> 00:17:32,247
I was smart back then, so they called me Ten-Gallon Head.

203
00:17:32,856 --> 00:17:34,983
- Hoss wears that hat.    - Hoss?

204
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:36,988
Hoss Can'twright on Bonanza.

205
00:17:37,428 --> 00:17:40,955
- How do you know Bonanza?    - We watch it at Mrs. Chu's.

206
00:17:41,632 --> 00:17:44,726
- You watch Bonanza at daycare?    - Yeah.

207
00:17:45,803 --> 00:17:47,862
When? When do you watch it?

208
00:17:48,072 --> 00:17:51,735
- After snack? After your nap?    - After Love Boat.

209
00:17:56,647 --> 00:17:58,808
I made my list for my birthday.

210
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:04,111
- Yeah, what'd you put on there?    - A basketball or an ant farm.

211
00:18:07,725 --> 00:18:11,991
- He says he's been watching TV.    - Oh, little TV for history.

212
00:18:12,196 --> 00:18:15,290
- Love Boat?    - For history. Navy.

213
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:17,762
That's not the Navy.

214
00:18:17,968 --> 00:18:20,095
I mean, he could watch television at home.

215
00:18:20,304 --> 00:18:24,673
We're paying you $ 150 a month. If he's gonna be sitting around...

216
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,275
...watching TV all day, we're taking him out of here.

217
00:18:27,478 --> 00:18:31,278
Go pay more at other daycare if you don't like Navy TV.

218
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:38,349
You late pay anyway. You complain. I complain.

219
00:18:39,857 --> 00:18:43,657
Can you at least put the dog upstairs in your room or something?

220
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:45,328
Bye.

221
00:19:29,706 --> 00:19:33,608
I was waiting for Witter Resource head Jay Twistle...

222
00:19:33,844 --> 00:19:39,339
...whose name sounded so delightful, like he'd give me a job and a hug.

223
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:43,543
I just had to show him I was good with numbers and good with people.

224
00:19:43,754 --> 00:19:45,312
- Morning, Mr. Twistle.    - Good morning.

225
00:19:45,522 --> 00:19:46,921
- Mr. Twistle, Chris Gardner.    - Hi.

226
00:19:47,124 --> 00:19:49,922
I wanted to drop this off personally and make your acquaintance.

227
00:19:50,127 --> 00:19:53,528
I thought I'd catch you on the way in. I'd love the opportunity to discuss...

228
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,960
...what may seem like weaknesses on my application.

229
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,964
We'll start with this, and we'll call you if we wanna sit down.

230
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:02,138
- Yes, sir. You have a great day.    - You too.

231
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:10,771
Hey, yeah, how you doing?

232
00:20:10,981 --> 00:20:13,176
This is Chris Gardner calling for Dr. Delsey.

233
00:20:13,383 --> 00:20:15,544
Yeah, I'm running a little late for a sales call.

234
00:20:15,752 --> 00:20:19,244
I was wondering if... Yeah, Osteo National.

235
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,015
Right. We can still...? Half an hour?

236
00:20:22,226 --> 00:20:25,889
Yes. Beautiful. Beautiful. Thank you, thank you.

237
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:38,567
Hey! Hey!

238
00:20:39,676 --> 00:20:41,041
Hey!

239
00:20:41,245 --> 00:20:42,610
This part of my life...

240
00:20:42,813 --> 00:20:45,509
- Wait! ...this part here...

241
00:20:47,084 --> 00:20:48,711
...it' called "Running."

242
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:50,853
Hey! Hey!

243
00:20:51,054 --> 00:20:52,612
Wait!

244
00:20:53,524 --> 00:20:56,357
Hey! Wait!

245
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,926
That was my stolen machine.

246
00:20:59,129 --> 00:21:01,188
Unless she was with a guy who sold them too.

247
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:03,961
Which was unlikely...

248
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:06,829
...because I was the only one selling them in the Bay Area.

249
00:21:07,037 --> 00:21:09,699
I spent our entire life savings on these things.

250
00:21:12,109 --> 00:21:15,704
It was such a revolutionary machine.

251
00:21:16,847 --> 00:21:18,280
- Can you feel it, baby?    - Oh, yeah.

252
00:21:18,482 --> 00:21:20,006
You got me doing all the work.

253
00:21:20,217 --> 00:21:22,742
What I didn't know is that doctors and hospitals...

254
00:21:22,953 --> 00:21:26,821
...would consider them unnecessary luxuries.

255
00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:32,895
I even asked the landlord to take a picture.

256
00:21:34,164 --> 00:21:39,067
So if I lost one, it was like losing a month' groceries.

257
00:21:41,972 --> 00:21:44,941
Hey, hey! Wait! Wait!

258
00:21:47,811 --> 00:21:50,507
Hey, get back here!

259
00:21:55,085 --> 00:21:57,576
Hey, man, l...

260
00:21:59,423 --> 00:22:01,755
- Who's he?    - He's that guy...

261
00:22:12,235 --> 00:22:16,137
- Did you forget?    - Forget what?

262
00:22:17,074 --> 00:22:19,565
You're not supposed to have any of those.

263
00:22:19,776 --> 00:22:23,007
- Yeah, I know.    - You have two now.

264
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,914
Hey.

265
00:22:37,861 --> 00:22:39,488
Hey, Mom.

266
00:22:44,835 --> 00:22:48,703
One, two, three!

267
00:22:49,773 --> 00:22:52,901
- That's a basketball!    - Hey, hey. What do you mean?

268
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,839
You don't know that that's a basketball.

269
00:22:55,045 --> 00:22:58,947
This could be an ant farm. This could be a microscope or anything.

270
00:22:59,149 --> 00:23:01,617
- No, it's not.    - There, there.

271
00:23:02,052 --> 00:23:05,112
All right, come on. Open him up. Open him up.

272
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:15,398
- That paper's a little heavy, huh?    - Yeah, but I got it.

273
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,170
You should've seen me out there today.

274
00:23:29,379 --> 00:23:31,904
Somebody stole a scanner. I had to run the old girl down...

275
00:23:32,115 --> 00:23:33,707
Whatever.

276
00:23:35,285 --> 00:23:38,379
- What?    - Whatever, Chris.

277
00:23:38,955 --> 00:23:40,786
What the hell you got attitude about?

278
00:23:40,991 --> 00:23:43,789
- "Whatever" what?    - Every day's got some damn story.

279
00:23:43,994 --> 00:23:45,359
Hey, Roy. Roy!

280
00:23:45,562 --> 00:23:47,860
Can you beat your little rug when nobody's out here?

281
00:23:48,065 --> 00:23:49,498
There's dust and shit all over.

282
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,100
- I'm trying to keep a clean house.    - Hey, wait a second.

283
00:23:52,302 --> 00:23:55,066
Look, Linda, relax.

284
00:23:55,272 --> 00:23:58,605
We're gonna come out of this. Everything is gonna be fine, all right?

285
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:03,612
You said that before, when I got pregnant. "lt'll be fine."

286
00:24:03,814 --> 00:24:08,808
- So you don't trust me now?    - Whatever. I don't care.

287
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,230
- Taxi!    - Mr. Twistle.

288
00:24:26,436 --> 00:24:29,098
- Yeah, hi.    - Hi. Chris Gardner.

289
00:24:29,306 --> 00:24:31,137
Yeah, hi. Listen. What can I do for you?

290
00:24:31,341 --> 00:24:34,401
I submitted an application for the intern program about a month ago...

291
00:24:34,611 --> 00:24:36,841
...and I would just love to sit with you briefly...

292
00:24:37,047 --> 00:24:39,015
Listen, I'm going to Noe Valley, Chris.

293
00:24:39,216 --> 00:24:42,515
- Take care of yourself.    - Mr. Twistle.

294
00:24:42,719 --> 00:24:45,085
Actually, I'm on my way to Noe Valley also.

295
00:24:45,288 --> 00:24:47,017
How about we share a ride?

296
00:24:48,525 --> 00:24:50,686
- All right, get in.    - All right.

297
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,530
So when I was in the Navy, I worked for a doctor...

298
00:24:59,736 --> 00:25:02,569
...who loved to play golf, hours every day...

299
00:25:02,773 --> 00:25:07,403
...and I would actually perform medical procedures...

300
00:25:07,611 --> 00:25:09,169
...when he'd leave me in the office.

301
00:25:09,379 --> 00:25:14,646
So I'm used to being in a position where I have to make decisions and...

302
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:18,952
Mr. Twistle, listen. This is a very important...

303
00:25:19,156 --> 00:25:21,351
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. This thing's impossible.

304
00:25:23,426 --> 00:25:25,553
- I can do it.    - No, you can't. No one can.

305
00:25:25,762 --> 00:25:28,424
- That's bullshit.    - No, I'm pretty sure I can do it.

306
00:25:28,899 --> 00:25:32,062
- No, you can't.    - Let me see it.

307
00:25:32,636 --> 00:25:33,864
Give it here.

308
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:41,140
Oh, yeah. Oh, wow, you really messed it up.

309
00:25:41,344 --> 00:25:42,868
Sorry.

310
00:25:43,413 --> 00:25:49,374
It looks like it works around a swivel, so the center pieces never move.

311
00:25:49,586 --> 00:25:52,680
So if it's yellow in the center, that's the yellow side.

312
00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:55,380
If it's red in the center, that's the red side.

313
00:25:55,592 --> 00:25:59,221
- Okay.    - So... You can slow down.

314
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:02,489
Listen, we can drive around all day. I don't believe you can do this.

315
00:26:02,699 --> 00:26:04,394
- Yeah, I can.    - No, you can't.

316
00:26:04,601 --> 00:26:05,761
- Yes, I can.    - No, you can't.

317
00:26:05,969 --> 00:26:07,903
I'm telling you, no one can.

318
00:26:09,806 --> 00:26:12,070
See? That's all I ever do.

319
00:26:24,955 --> 00:26:27,253
You almost have this side.

320
00:26:27,858 --> 00:26:29,325
Holy cow.

321
00:26:39,536 --> 00:26:43,336
- You almost had that one.    - I'm gonna get it.

322
00:26:50,881 --> 00:26:52,644
Look at that.

323
00:27:15,906 --> 00:27:17,134
You're almost there.

324
00:27:40,864 --> 00:27:44,561
- 17.10.    - This is me.

325
00:27:46,703 --> 00:27:48,102
Good job.

326
00:27:49,906 --> 00:27:53,034
- Goodbye.    - Yeah. I'll see you soon.

327
00:27:55,445 --> 00:27:57,174
Where are you going, sir?

328
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,372
Excuse me, sir. Where are you going, please?

329
00:28:03,687 --> 00:28:05,450
Two... A couple of blocks.

330
00:28:05,655 --> 00:28:09,056
- Just flip around.    - Okay.

331
00:28:50,967 --> 00:28:53,731
Hey! Stop it! Hey!

332
00:28:54,104 --> 00:28:55,662
- Where are you going? Come here!    - No!

333
00:28:55,872 --> 00:28:58,705
- No, no, no!    - You asshole, give me my money!

334
00:28:58,908 --> 00:29:00,239
- Give me my money.    - Please stop.

335
00:29:00,443 --> 00:29:02,434
- Please, please, please!    - Son of a bitch.

336
00:29:02,645 --> 00:29:05,205
Please! He should've paid you!

337
00:29:05,415 --> 00:29:06,939
- Come here!    - I'm sorry.

338
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,845
- I'm so sorry.    - I'll kick your ass!

339
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:12,482
- I'm sorry!    - Idiot.

340
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:24,630
I'll get you!

341
00:29:24,834 --> 00:29:28,326
I'm going to kill you! I'm going to kill you!

342
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,813
Hey!

343
00:29:46,022 --> 00:29:48,923
Stop it, you son of a bitch!

344
00:29:49,192 --> 00:29:51,285
Stop him!

345
00:29:54,697 --> 00:29:57,222
Stop him!

346
00:30:02,472 --> 00:30:04,167
The doors are closing.

347
00:30:04,374 --> 00:30:07,207
Please stand clear of the doors.

348
00:30:15,151 --> 00:30:18,279
No! No! No!

349
00:30:20,957 --> 00:30:22,754
No!

350
00:30:45,915 --> 00:30:48,281
- Hello?    - Hey, yeah.

351
00:30:48,485 --> 00:30:50,180
Sorry I couldn't make it home on time.

352
00:30:50,386 --> 00:30:54,618
- Chris, I missed my shift.    - Yeah, I know. I'm sorry about that.

353
00:30:54,824 --> 00:30:58,123
Look, I'm on my way right now. Are you all right with Christopher?

354
00:30:58,328 --> 00:31:00,694
I'm leaving. Chris, I'm leaving.

355
00:31:00,897 --> 00:31:02,888
- What?    - Did you hear what I said?

356
00:31:03,766 --> 00:31:07,702
I have my things together, and I'm taking our son...

357
00:31:07,904 --> 00:31:09,428
...and we're gonna leave now.

358
00:31:09,806 --> 00:31:11,205
I'm gonna put the phone down.

359
00:31:11,407 --> 00:31:14,934
- Linda, wait a minute. Hold it, hold...    - I'm going to leave. We are leaving.

360
00:31:20,116 --> 00:31:24,075
It was right then that I started thinking about Thomas Jefferson...

361
00:31:25,388 --> 00:31:27,856
...the Declaration of Independence...

362
00:31:28,191 --> 00:31:34,152
...and the part about our right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

363
00:31:34,364 --> 00:31:36,195
And I remember thinking:

364
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,768
How did he know to put the "pursuit" part in there?

365
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:45,669
That maybe happiness is something that we can only pursue.

366
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:48,901
And maybe we can actually never have it...

367
00:31:49,245 --> 00:31:50,906
...no matter what.

368
00:31:51,114 --> 00:31:52,809
How did he know that?

369
00:31:58,054 --> 00:32:00,852
Linda. Linda.

370
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,485
- Hello?    - Chris.

371
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:38,320
- Who is this?    - Jay Twistle.

372
00:32:39,162 --> 00:32:40,993
- Hey.    - Dean Witter.

373
00:32:41,197 --> 00:32:43,893
Yeah, of course. How are you?

374
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,568
I'm fine. Listen, do you still wanna come in and talk?

375
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:48,031
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

376
00:32:48,238 --> 00:32:51,139
I'll tell you what. Come on by day after tomorrow, in the morning.

377
00:32:51,341 --> 00:32:55,107
We're interviewing for the internships. You got a pen and paper?

378
00:32:55,345 --> 00:32:56,869
Yes. Yes, I do.

379
00:32:59,849 --> 00:33:02,613
- Hold on one second.    - All right.

380
00:33:06,489 --> 00:33:08,616
Hello?

381
00:33:08,825 --> 00:33:11,157
- Chris?    - Go ahead. I have one.

382
00:33:11,361 --> 00:33:13,989
Write this number down so you can call my secretary, Janice.

383
00:33:14,197 --> 00:33:16,256
- She can give you all the specifics.    - Yep.

384
00:33:16,466 --> 00:33:18,331
- Okay, 415.    - 415.

385
00:33:18,534 --> 00:33:20,229
- 864.    - 864.

386
00:33:20,436 --> 00:33:22,461
- 0256.    - 0256.

387
00:33:22,672 --> 00:33:25,664
- Yeah, extension 4796.    - 4796.

388
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:30,141
- Right. Call her tomorrow.    - Yes, sir. 415-864-0256.

389
00:33:30,346 --> 00:33:31,643
- Okay, buddy.    - All right, yes.

390
00:33:31,848 --> 00:33:34,009
- Thank you very much.    - We'll see you soon.

391
00:33:34,784 --> 00:33:37,947
864-0256.

392
00:33:38,154 --> 00:33:41,351
4796. Janice.

393
00:33:44,394 --> 00:33:46,225
- Chris.    - Hey.

394
00:33:46,429 --> 00:33:48,693
Did you...? Have you seen Linda and Christopher?

395
00:33:48,898 --> 00:33:50,798
- No. You catch the game last night?    - No, no.

396
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,365
You didn't see that, 118, 1...?

397
00:33:52,568 --> 00:33:54,763
Excuse me, did Linda and Christopher come in here?

398
00:33:54,971 --> 00:33:58,634
- No, I haven't see them.    - 119-120. Double overtime.

399
00:33:58,841 --> 00:34:00,968
Moons hits a three-pointer at 17 seconds left.

400
00:34:01,177 --> 00:34:02,769
Wayne, Wayne, Wayne.

401
00:34:02,979 --> 00:34:05,106
Can't talk to you about numbers right now.

402
00:34:05,315 --> 00:34:07,943
- What's your problem with numbers?    - 864-2...

403
00:34:08,151 --> 00:34:10,085
- And you owe me money.    - Yeah.

404
00:34:10,286 --> 00:34:12,049
You owe me $ 14.

405
00:34:12,255 --> 00:34:14,120
I'm gonna get that to you.

406
00:34:14,991 --> 00:34:17,459
I need my money. I need my money.

407
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:20,654
Fourteers a number.

408
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:50,321
Hey, don't you ever take my son away from me again.

409
00:34:50,526 --> 00:34:51,823
- You hear me?    - Leave me alone!

410
00:34:52,028 --> 00:34:53,859
Don't take my son away from me again.

411
00:34:54,063 --> 00:34:55,826
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

412
00:34:56,032 --> 00:34:59,331
Don't you walk away from me when I'm talking to you. Do you hear me?

413
00:34:59,535 --> 00:35:01,059
- Do you wanna leave?    - Yeah.

414
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:04,103
- You wanna leave?    - Yes, I want to leave!

415
00:35:05,341 --> 00:35:07,206
Get the hell out of here, then, Linda.

416
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,935
Get the hell out of here. Christopher's staying with me.

417
00:35:10,146 --> 00:35:12,444
You're the one that dragged us down. You hear me?

418
00:35:12,648 --> 00:35:15,742
- You are so weak.    - No. I am not happy anymore.

419
00:35:15,952 --> 00:35:18,546
- I'm just not happy!    - Then go get happy, Linda!

420
00:35:18,755 --> 00:35:20,120
Just go get happy.

421
00:35:20,656 --> 00:35:22,521
But Christopher's living with me.

422
00:35:22,725 --> 00:35:24,522
- Stop!    - Did you hear what I said?

423
00:35:24,827 --> 00:35:27,227
Christopher's living with me!

424
00:35:53,389 --> 00:35:56,324
Hey. Come on, let's go.

425
00:35:56,526 --> 00:35:58,858
- How you doing, Mrs. Chu?    - Hi.

426
00:36:02,532 --> 00:36:05,092
- Where's Mom?    - Look, just get your stuff.

427
00:36:05,301 --> 00:36:08,759
But she told me she was coming to pick me up today.

428
00:36:08,971 --> 00:36:10,996
Yeah, I know.

429
00:36:12,141 --> 00:36:16,771
I talked to Mom earlier. Everything's fine, okay?

430
00:36:22,218 --> 00:36:24,413
Where do I sleep tonight?

431
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,747
Let me ask you something. Are you happy?

432
00:36:26,956 --> 00:36:29,618
- Yeah.    - All right. Because I'm happy.

433
00:36:29,826 --> 00:36:33,284
And if you're happy and I'm happy, then that's a good thing, right?

434
00:36:33,496 --> 00:36:35,020
- Yeah.    - All right.

435
00:36:35,231 --> 00:36:37,256
You're sleeping with me.

436
00:36:37,467 --> 00:36:42,131
You're staying at home, where you belong, all right?

437
00:36:56,586 --> 00:36:58,247
Christopher.

438
00:37:15,805 --> 00:37:18,638
Hey, listen. I need the rent.

439
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:20,274
I can't wait anymore.

440
00:37:20,476 --> 00:37:22,876
Yeah, I'm good for that, Charlie. I'm gonna get it.

441
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:26,105
Why don't you go two blocks over at the Mission Inn motel?

442
00:37:26,315 --> 00:37:27,873
It's half what you pay here.

443
00:37:28,084 --> 00:37:31,485
Listen, Chris. I need you out of here in the morning.

444
00:37:32,855 --> 00:37:35,016
The hell am I supposed to be out of here tomorrow?

445
00:37:35,224 --> 00:37:36,418
I got painters coming in.

446
00:37:36,626 --> 00:37:38,924
- All right, look. I need more time.    - No.

447
00:37:39,128 --> 00:37:41,255
All right, I'll paint it myself.

448
00:37:41,464 --> 00:37:46,834
All right, but I just... I gotta have some more time... I got my son up in here.

449
00:37:51,674 --> 00:37:56,509
All right. One week. And you paint it.

450
00:38:48,397 --> 00:38:50,024
Chris Gardner?

451
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,330
Yeah. What happened?

452
00:38:53,536 --> 00:38:57,404
- Payable to the City of San francisco.    - Does it have to be the full amount?

453
00:38:57,607 --> 00:39:01,099
You gotta pay each parking ticket, otherwise, you're staying.

454
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,777
This is all I got.

455
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,946
You verify at 9:30 tomorrow morning.

456
00:39:11,487 --> 00:39:14,513
- What?    - You gotta stay until this thing clears.

457
00:39:16,692 --> 00:39:18,250
No.

458
00:39:18,461 --> 00:39:20,258
No, I can't spend the night here.

459
00:39:20,463 --> 00:39:23,057
- I have to pick up my son.    - You verify at 9:30 tomorrow.

460
00:39:23,265 --> 00:39:27,895
Sir, I have a job interview at Dean Witter at 10:15 tomorrow morning.

461
00:39:28,104 --> 00:39:29,799
- I cannot stay...    - 9:30 tomorrow morning.

462
00:39:30,006 --> 00:39:32,338
What am I supposed to do with my son?

463
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:35,009
- Is there anyone else who can...?    - I take care of him.

464
00:39:35,211 --> 00:39:38,237
Maybe we can go and have Social Services pick him up.

465
00:39:42,284 --> 00:39:45,981
All right. Can I have my phone call, please?

466
00:39:49,158 --> 00:39:51,422
- Hello.    - Hey.

467
00:39:51,627 --> 00:39:53,356
What do you want?

468
00:39:54,497 --> 00:39:59,127
You gotta get Christopher from daycare. I can't.

469
00:40:00,302 --> 00:40:03,965
Just keep him for the night and I'm... And... Just one night.

470
00:40:04,173 --> 00:40:06,232
What happened?

471
00:40:06,442 --> 00:40:09,900
I'll pick him up from daycare tomorrow.

472
00:40:10,112 --> 00:40:11,875
I'm gonna go right... You can just...

473
00:40:12,081 --> 00:40:14,379
You can drop him off and I'll pick him up.

474
00:40:14,717 --> 00:40:18,153
- No.    - Come on, Linda.

475
00:40:18,354 --> 00:40:22,620
- Why you doing that?    - No, I wanna take him to the park.

476
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:27,155
To Golden Gate after daycare tomorrow.

477
00:40:28,431 --> 00:40:30,558
- How is he?    - He's fine.

478
00:40:30,766 --> 00:40:33,826
All right, just... All right, take him to the park...

479
00:40:34,036 --> 00:40:37,836
...and bring him back, all right?

480
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,009
All right, just bring me my son back.

481
00:40:41,977 --> 00:40:43,877
Okay?

482
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,604
Linda?

483
00:40:45,815 --> 00:40:47,715
I'll bring him back around 6.

484
00:40:49,585 --> 00:40:51,746
All right, all right.

485
00:40:51,954 --> 00:40:53,819
Thank you.

486
00:40:56,258 --> 00:40:57,748
Bye.

487
00:41:22,551 --> 00:41:24,280
I'm okay?

488
00:41:59,221 --> 00:42:01,348
Excuse me. Excuse me.

489
00:42:01,891 --> 00:42:03,358
Yes, I did.

490
00:42:12,001 --> 00:42:13,798
Mr. Gardner.

491
00:42:20,876 --> 00:42:22,776
This way.

492
00:42:25,014 --> 00:42:27,039
It'll be right this way.

493
00:42:39,128 --> 00:42:40,561
What is the word on that one?

494
00:43:02,218 --> 00:43:04,083
Chris Gardner.

495
00:43:06,655 --> 00:43:08,316
Chris Gardner.

496
00:43:08,757 --> 00:43:10,748
How are you? Good morning.

497
00:43:11,327 --> 00:43:15,229
Chris Gardner. Chris Gardner. Good to see you again.

498
00:43:15,431 --> 00:43:17,399
Chris Gardner. Pleasure.

499
00:43:19,034 --> 00:43:21,127
I've been sitting there for the last half-hour...

500
00:43:21,337 --> 00:43:22,895
...trying to come up with a story...

501
00:43:23,105 --> 00:43:27,371
...that would explain my being here dressed like this.

502
00:43:27,576 --> 00:43:31,603
And I wanted to come up with a story that would demonstrate qualities...

503
00:43:31,814 --> 00:43:36,649
...that I'm sure you all admire here, like earnestness or diligence.

504
00:43:36,852 --> 00:43:41,551
Team-playing, something. And I couldn't think of anything.

505
00:43:42,725 --> 00:43:44,488
So the truth is...

506
00:43:44,693 --> 00:43:47,321
...I was arrested for failure to pay parking tickets.

507
00:43:47,529 --> 00:43:49,394
Parking tickets?

508
00:43:49,899 --> 00:43:53,460
And I ran all the way here from the Polk Station, the police station.

509
00:43:53,669 --> 00:43:55,660
What were you doing before you were arrested?

510
00:43:55,871 --> 00:43:58,897
I was painting my apartment.

511
00:43:59,108 --> 00:44:01,269
Is it dry now?

512
00:44:02,011 --> 00:44:03,205
I hope so.

513
00:44:03,412 --> 00:44:05,141
Jay says you're pretty determined.

514
00:44:05,347 --> 00:44:07,713
He's been waiting outside the front of the building...

515
00:44:07,917 --> 00:44:10,044
...with some 40-pound gizmo for over a month.

516
00:44:10,252 --> 00:44:13,653
- He said you're smart.    - Well, I like to think so.

517
00:44:13,856 --> 00:44:16,848
- And you want to learn this business?    - Yes, sir, I wanna learn.

518
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:19,084
Have you already started learning on your own?

519
00:44:19,295 --> 00:44:20,956
Absolutely.

520
00:44:21,697 --> 00:44:23,494
- Jay?    - Yes, sir.

521
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:25,792
How many times have you seen Chris?

522
00:44:26,001 --> 00:44:28,663
I don't know. One too many, apparently.

523
00:44:29,271 --> 00:44:31,637
- Was he ever dressed like this?    - No.

524
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,035
No. Jacket and tie.

525
00:44:35,945 --> 00:44:38,846
First in your class in school?

526
00:44:39,048 --> 00:44:40,879
- High school?    - Yes, sir.

527
00:44:41,317 --> 00:44:44,309
- How many in the class?    - Twelve.

528
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,249
It was a small town.

529
00:44:46,689 --> 00:44:50,056
- I'll say.    - But I was also first in my radar class...

530
00:44:50,259 --> 00:44:53,524
...in the Navy, and that was a class of 20.

531
00:44:55,998 --> 00:44:57,829
Can I say something?

532
00:44:59,001 --> 00:45:00,696
I'm the type of person...

533
00:45:00,903 --> 00:45:04,168
...if you ask me a question, and I don't know the answer...

534
00:45:04,373 --> 00:45:06,637
...I 'm gonna tell you that I don't know.

535
00:45:06,842 --> 00:45:08,173
But I bet you what.

536
00:45:08,377 --> 00:45:13,371
I know how to find the answer, and I will find the answer.

537
00:45:14,583 --> 00:45:16,312
Is that fair enough?

538
00:45:17,553 --> 00:45:18,747
Chris.

539
00:45:20,089 --> 00:45:23,820
What would you say if a guy walked in for an interview...

540
00:45:24,026 --> 00:45:26,017
...without a shirt on...

541
00:45:26,228 --> 00:45:29,163
...and I hired him? What would you say?

542
00:45:33,402 --> 00:45:36,496
He must've had on some really nice pants.

543
00:45:51,186 --> 00:45:54,747
Chris, I don't know how you did it dressed as a garbage man...

544
00:45:54,957 --> 00:45:57,221
...but you pulled it off.    - Thank you, Mr. Twistle.

545
00:45:57,426 --> 00:45:59,826
Hey, now you can call me Jay. We'll talk to you soon.

546
00:46:00,429 --> 00:46:02,954
All right, so I'll let you know, Jay.

547
00:46:03,766 --> 00:46:06,064
"You'll let me know, Jay"? What do you mean?

548
00:46:06,268 --> 00:46:08,236
Yeah, I'll give you a call tomorrow sometime...

549
00:46:08,437 --> 00:46:10,564
What are you talking...? You hounded me for this.

550
00:46:10,773 --> 00:46:13,537
- You stood here...    - Listen, there's no salary.

551
00:46:13,742 --> 00:46:15,107
- No.    - I was not aware of that.

552
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:16,902
My circumstances have changed some...

553
00:46:17,446 --> 00:46:21,143
...and I need to be certain that I'll be...    - All right. Okay.

554
00:46:24,286 --> 00:46:25,878
Tonight.

555
00:46:26,088 --> 00:46:29,580
I swear I will fill your spot. I promise.

556
00:46:29,792 --> 00:46:32,784
If you back out, you know what I'll look like to the partners?

557
00:46:32,995 --> 00:46:35,964
Yes, an ass... A-hole.

558
00:46:36,265 --> 00:46:39,666
Yeah, an ass A-hole, all the way.

559
00:46:42,538 --> 00:46:45,132
You are a piece of work.

560
00:46:46,175 --> 00:46:47,733
Tonight.

561
00:46:56,018 --> 00:46:57,986
There was no salary.

562
00:46:58,187 --> 00:47:01,350
Not even a reasonable promise of a job.

563
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:12,660
One intern was hired at the end of the program from a pool of 20.

564
00:47:13,001 --> 00:47:14,298
And if you werert that guy...

565
00:47:14,503 --> 00:47:16,869
...you couldn't even apply the six months' training...

566
00:47:17,072 --> 00:47:18,903
...to another brokerage.

567
00:47:21,443 --> 00:47:23,570
The only resource I would have for six months...

568
00:47:23,779 --> 00:47:27,715
...would be my six scanners, which I could still try to sell.

569
00:47:28,917 --> 00:47:32,375
If I sold them all, maybe we might get by.

570
00:48:19,268 --> 00:48:22,499
- I got him. I got him.    - He's asleep.

571
00:48:22,704 --> 00:48:24,228
All right.

572
00:48:30,612 --> 00:48:32,512
Okay, baby.

573
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,823
I got it.

574
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,859
I'm going to New York.

575
00:49:23,298 --> 00:49:25,630
My sister's boyfriend...

576
00:49:26,201 --> 00:49:29,693
...opened a restaurant, and they may have a job for me there.

577
00:49:30,472 --> 00:49:32,963
So I'm going to New York, Chris.

578
00:49:35,944 --> 00:49:37,844
Christopher's staying with me.

579
00:49:44,786 --> 00:49:47,619
I'm his mom, you know?

580
00:49:47,823 --> 00:49:49,916
He should be with his mom.

581
00:49:50,125 --> 00:49:51,990
I should have him, right?

582
00:49:52,861 --> 00:49:55,227
You know you can't take care of him.

583
00:50:03,138 --> 00:50:04,662
What are you gonna do for money?

584
00:50:06,908 --> 00:50:12,403
I had an interview at Dean Witter for an internship...

585
00:50:12,614 --> 00:50:14,081
...and I got it.

586
00:50:14,283 --> 00:50:16,843
So I'm gonna stand out in my program.

587
00:50:18,553 --> 00:50:20,646
Salesman to interrs backwards.

588
00:50:20,856 --> 00:50:22,790
No, it's not.

589
00:50:24,926 --> 00:50:26,621
I gotta go.

590
00:51:00,195 --> 00:51:02,561
Tell him I love him, okay?

591
00:51:03,198 --> 00:51:04,790
And...

592
00:51:10,739 --> 00:51:13,071
I know you'll take care of him, Chris.

593
00:51:13,275 --> 00:51:14,970
I know that.

594
00:51:56,585 --> 00:51:59,315
- Dean Witter.    - Yes, hi.

595
00:51:59,621 --> 00:52:03,352
Yes, I'd like to leave a message for Mr. Jay Twistle.

596
00:52:03,558 --> 00:52:07,119
- Your name?    - Yeah, my name is Chris Gardner.

597
00:52:07,329 --> 00:52:08,455
The message is:

598
00:52:08,663 --> 00:52:14,329
Thank you very much for inviting me into the program.

599
00:52:14,536 --> 00:52:20,406
I really appreciate it and I'd be very pleased to accept your invitation.

600
00:52:20,609 --> 00:52:22,474
Is that all?

601
00:52:22,744 --> 00:52:24,302
Yes, that's it.

602
00:52:24,513 --> 00:52:26,276
- Okay.    - Thank you.

603
00:52:26,481 --> 00:52:28,039
Bye.

604
00:52:54,643 --> 00:52:55,940
- Be careful with that.    - What?

605
00:52:56,144 --> 00:52:58,908
Be care... Go ahead.

606
00:53:22,771 --> 00:53:25,706
- Are we there?    - Yep.

607
00:53:38,987 --> 00:53:41,547
- Hey, you know what today is?    - Yeah.

608
00:53:41,756 --> 00:53:43,417
- What?    - Saturday.

609
00:53:43,625 --> 00:53:45,923
- You know what Saturday is, right?    - Yeah.

610
00:53:46,127 --> 00:53:48,561
- What?    - Basketball.

611
00:53:48,763 --> 00:53:51,664
- You wanna go play some basketball?    - Okay.

612
00:53:51,867 --> 00:53:54,427
All right, then we're gonna go sell a bone-density scanner.

613
00:53:54,636 --> 00:53:58,902
- How about that? Wanna do that?    - No.

614
00:54:00,108 --> 00:54:02,508
Hey, Dad. I'm going pro.

615
00:54:04,212 --> 00:54:06,180
I'm going pro.

616
00:54:07,449 --> 00:54:08,814
Okay.

617
00:54:09,017 --> 00:54:11,815
Yeah, I don't know, you know.

618
00:54:12,554 --> 00:54:14,784
You'll probably be about as good as I was.

619
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:18,084
That's kind of the way it works, you know. I was below average.

620
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:22,089
You know, so you'll probably ultimately rank...

621
00:54:22,297 --> 00:54:24,925
...somewhere around there, you know, so...

622
00:54:25,133 --> 00:54:28,000
...I really... You'll excel at a lot of things, just not this.

623
00:54:28,203 --> 00:54:30,637
I don't want you shooting this ball all day and night.

624
00:54:30,839 --> 00:54:32,363
- All right?    - All right.

625
00:54:32,574 --> 00:54:34,405
Okay.

626
00:54:35,544 --> 00:54:37,171
All right, go ahead.

627
00:55:01,002 --> 00:55:02,629
Hey.

628
00:55:05,807 --> 00:55:08,139
Don't ever let somebody tell you...

629
00:55:08,343 --> 00:55:10,903
...you can't do something.

630
00:55:11,613 --> 00:55:13,706
Not even me.

631
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:18,247
- All right?    - All right.

632
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,115
You got a dream...

633
00:55:21,323 --> 00:55:23,553
...you gotta protect it.

634
00:55:24,659 --> 00:55:26,320
People can't do something themselves...

635
00:55:26,528 --> 00:55:28,962
...they wanna tell you you can't do it.

636
00:55:33,301 --> 00:55:37,101
If you want something, go get it. Period.

637
00:55:45,146 --> 00:55:46,704
Let's go.

638
00:55:48,883 --> 00:55:50,614
Dad, why did we move to a motel?

639
00:55:50,615 --> 00:55:52,346
Dad, why did we move to a motel?

640
00:55:52,554 --> 00:55:55,022
I told you. Because I'm getting a better job.

641
00:55:56,291 --> 00:55:59,317
- You gotta trust me, all right?    - I trust you.

642
00:55:59,527 --> 00:56:02,257
All right, here. Come on, come on. Keep up.

643
00:56:03,498 --> 00:56:06,467
Dad, whers Mom coming back?

644
00:56:07,002 --> 00:56:09,197
Dad, whers Mom coming back?

645
00:56:09,404 --> 00:56:11,634
I don't know, Christopher.

646
00:56:11,973 --> 00:56:13,907
Dad, listen to this.

647
00:56:14,109 --> 00:56:17,567
One day, a man was drowning in the water.

648
00:56:17,779 --> 00:56:20,247
And a boat came by and said, "Do you need any help?"

649
00:56:20,448 --> 00:56:22,780
He said, "No, thank you. God will save me."

650
00:56:22,984 --> 00:56:26,181
Then another boat came by. Said, "Do you need any help?"

651
00:56:26,388 --> 00:56:28,754
And he said, "No, thank you. God will save me."

652
00:56:28,957 --> 00:56:31,084
Then he drowned, and he went to heaven.

653
00:56:31,292 --> 00:56:34,523
And he said, "God, why didn't you save me?"

654
00:56:34,729 --> 00:56:38,221
And God said, "I sent you two big boats, you dummy."

655
00:56:39,534 --> 00:56:40,967
Do you like it?

656
00:56:41,169 --> 00:56:43,899
Yeah, that's very funny, man. Give me your hand.

657
00:56:49,911 --> 00:56:51,572
- Thank you very much, sir.    - Yes, sir.

658
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:53,407
- You got the bill of sale here.    - Yes.

659
00:56:53,615 --> 00:56:55,014
All the information you'll need.

660
00:56:55,216 --> 00:56:56,843
Thank you very much for your business.

661
00:56:57,052 --> 00:56:58,542
Thank you.

662
00:57:01,256 --> 00:57:03,986
One hundred, 200, 20, 40, 45, 46...

663
00:57:04,192 --> 00:57:05,819
...7, 8, 9, 10.

664
00:57:06,428 --> 00:57:07,520
Thank you.

665
00:57:09,864 --> 00:57:12,799
- Hey, you want one of those?    - No, it's okay.

666
00:57:13,001 --> 00:57:15,299
Come on, you can have one. Which one?

667
00:57:16,204 --> 00:57:19,731
- You like that one? How much?    - Twenty-five cents.

668
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:37,697
This part of my life is called "Internship."

669
00:57:37,698 --> 00:57:41,065
The 1200 building is Medley Industrial and Sanko Oil.

670
00:57:41,268 --> 00:57:43,532
The building across the street is Lee-Ray Shipping.

671
00:57:43,737 --> 00:57:45,637
In a couple weeks, you'll get call sheets...

672
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,670
...with the phone numbers of employees...

673
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:51,003
...from every Fortune 500 company in the financial district.

674
00:57:51,312 --> 00:57:54,008
You will be pooling from 60 Fortune companies.

675
00:57:54,214 --> 00:57:56,978
You will mainly be cold-calling potential clients.

676
00:57:57,184 --> 00:58:00,176
But if you have to have lunch with them, have breakfast with them...

677
00:58:00,387 --> 00:58:03,652
...even baby-sit for them, do whatever it takes to familiarize them...

678
00:58:03,857 --> 00:58:06,792
...with our packages. We need you to match their needs and goals...

679
00:58:06,994 --> 00:58:11,931
...to one of our many financial plans. In essence, you reel them in...

680
00:58:12,132 --> 00:58:14,225
...we'll cook the fish.

681
00:58:15,035 --> 00:58:17,060
Some of you are here because you know somebody.

682
00:58:17,271 --> 00:58:19,671
Some of you are here because you think you're somebody.

683
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:22,431
There's one guy in here who's gonna be somebody.

684
00:58:22,643 --> 00:58:24,838
That persors gonna be the guy...

685
00:58:25,045 --> 00:58:27,309
...who can turn this into this.

686
00:58:27,514 --> 00:58:30,574
Eight hundred thousand in commission dollars.

687
00:58:31,118 --> 00:58:32,949
You, you, help me hand these out.

688
00:58:33,787 --> 00:58:36,847
This is going to be your bible.

689
00:58:37,057 --> 00:58:38,388
You'll eat with it.

690
00:58:38,592 --> 00:58:40,287
- You'll drink with it.    - It was simple.

691
00:58:40,494 --> 00:58:43,463
X number of calls equals X number of prospects.

692
00:58:43,664 --> 00:58:46,633
X number of prospects equals X number of customers.

693
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,994
X number of customers equals X number of dollars...

694
00:58:50,204 --> 00:58:52,365
...in the company' pocket.    - Your board exam.

695
00:58:52,573 --> 00:58:58,443
Last year, we had an intern score a 96.4 percent on the written exam.

696
00:58:58,646 --> 00:59:02,013
He wasrt chosen. It's not a simple passlfail.

697
00:59:02,216 --> 00:59:05,617
It's an evaluation tool we use to separate applicants.

698
00:59:05,819 --> 00:59:08,185
Be safe, score a hundred.

699
00:59:09,156 --> 00:59:10,656
Okay,

700
00:59:10,656 --> 00:59:13,156
let's take a break. Be back in 10.

701
00:59:22,001 --> 00:59:24,436
-Hey,Mr. Frohm. Chris.    -Hi.

702
00:59:24,637 --> 00:59:26,832
-Chris,how are you?-I'm good. How you doing?

703
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:31,136
-Fine,thank you for asking.    -First day in there. It was exciting.

704
00:59:31,344 --> 00:59:33,437
You're not quitting on us yet,are you?

705
00:59:33,646 --> 00:59:35,477
No,sir. Ten-minute break.

706
00:59:35,682 --> 00:59:38,480
Pop out,get a quick bite and then back in there for board prep.

707
00:59:38,685 --> 00:59:40,380
Oh,man,I remember mine.

708
00:59:40,587 --> 00:59:43,112
And ours were only an hour,not three like yours.

709
00:59:43,323 --> 00:59:45,723
We didn't do world markets,didn't bother with taxes...

710
00:59:45,925 --> 00:59:49,326
...and it was still a pain in the ass. Funny what you remember.

711
00:59:49,529 --> 00:59:51,690
There was a beautiful girl in that class.

712
00:59:51,898 --> 00:59:54,264
I can't remember her name,but her face was so...

713
00:59:54,467 --> 00:59:56,799
I've seen an old friend of mine. Do you mind?

714
00:59:57,003 --> 00:59:59,801
-No,go ahead.    -Good talking to you,sir.

715
01:00:29,302 --> 01:00:33,238
Hey,asshole. Are you all right,asshole?

716
01:00:33,539 --> 01:00:36,406
Are you okay?What were you thinking?

717
01:00:36,609 --> 01:00:38,804
What are you doing?I could've killed you.

718
01:00:39,012 --> 01:00:41,276
I'm trying to cross the street.

719
01:00:41,481 --> 01:00:44,939
-Well,you're all right?-Yeah,yeah.

720
01:00:45,284 --> 01:00:46,842
-Where's my shoe?-What?

721
01:00:47,053 --> 01:00:50,853
-You knocked off my shoe!-I don't know where your shoe is.

722
01:00:52,291 --> 01:00:55,192
-Where's my damn shoe?-I don't know.

723
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,467
Hey.

724
01:01:03,369 --> 01:01:06,634
-Did you see it?I lost my shoe.    -No,I'm sorry.

725
01:01:06,839 --> 01:01:10,206
Hey. Hey,where are you going?

726
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:13,311
-We should wait for the police.    -I gotta go to work.

727
01:01:14,013 --> 01:01:17,744
Hey,you just got hit by a car. Go to the hospital.

728
01:01:18,084 --> 01:01:21,611
I'm in a competitive internship at Dean Witter.

729
01:01:32,198 --> 01:01:33,859
Hey,man,you're missing a shoe.

730
01:01:34,067 --> 01:01:38,128
Oh,yeah,thanks. Thank you.

731
01:01:43,976 --> 01:01:45,375
Dad.

732
01:01:45,912 --> 01:01:48,904
-You don't have a shoe.    -Yeah,I know.

733
01:01:49,115 --> 01:01:52,175
-Wanna know what happened?-Yeah.

734
01:01:52,919 --> 01:01:54,409
I got hit by a car.

735
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:57,282
-You got hit by a car?-Yep.

736
01:01:57,490 --> 01:02:01,119
-Where?-Just right by the office.

737
01:02:01,327 --> 01:02:04,387
-No,where in your body?-Like,the back of my legs.

738
01:02:04,597 --> 01:02:06,428
-Hey,goodbye,Mrs. Chu.    -Goodbye.

739
01:02:06,632 --> 01:02:09,795
-Where you on the street?-Yeah,I was running in the street.

740
01:02:10,002 --> 01:02:12,903
Don't do that. You can get hurt.

741
01:02:13,239 --> 01:02:15,104
Yeah,thanks.

742
01:02:15,308 --> 01:02:17,037
I'll remember that next time.

743
01:02:19,345 --> 01:02:20,744
And here I was again.

744
01:02:20,947 --> 01:02:23,541
-Show up early.    -While qualified persons...

745
01:02:23,816 --> 01:02:27,684
...qualified persons are interested in investing and have money to invest.

746
01:02:27,887 --> 01:02:29,787
-Now,Chris.    -Yes,sir.

747
01:02:29,989 --> 01:02:32,014
Would you get me some coffee,please?

748
01:02:32,225 --> 01:02:36,127
Favors for Frakesh,our office manager. All day.

749
01:02:36,329 --> 01:02:38,889
My name is Chris Gardner calling for Mr. Michael Anderson.

750
01:02:39,098 --> 01:02:41,532
Yes,sir,we're having a lunch actually this Thursday.

751
01:02:41,734 --> 01:02:44,635
Okay,next time. All right,I'm gonna hold you to that.

752
01:02:44,837 --> 01:02:46,168
Okay,yes,thank you.

753
01:02:46,372 --> 01:02:47,737
Who wants to get me a doughnut?

754
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:51,671
-Chris?-Yes,sir.

755
01:02:53,045 --> 01:02:56,208
Feeling underrated and unappreciated.

756
01:02:56,516 --> 01:02:58,040
Hello,Mr. Ronald fryer.

757
01:02:58,251 --> 01:03:00,549
Good morning to you,sir. My name is Chris Gardner.

758
01:03:00,753 --> 01:03:02,118
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

759
01:03:02,321 --> 01:03:05,518
Yes,I have some very,very valuable information on what's called a tax...

760
01:03:05,725 --> 01:03:07,989
Okay,thank you,sir.

761
01:03:09,095 --> 01:03:13,794
Then catch the bus by 4 to the place where they can't spell "happiness."

762
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,763
Then the cross-town.

763
01:03:16,369 --> 01:03:18,132
The 22 home.

764
01:03:19,405 --> 01:03:22,033
-Hey,Chris!-Hey. Hi,Ralph.

765
01:03:22,241 --> 01:03:25,142
-I'm waiting.    -All right,I got that for you,Ralph.

766
01:03:25,344 --> 01:03:27,403
I'm gonna get that for you.

767
01:03:35,588 --> 01:03:39,024
Whoever brought in the most money after six months was usually hired.

768
01:03:39,225 --> 01:03:41,318
Hello,Chris Gardner calling for Mr. Walter Hobb.

769
01:03:41,527 --> 01:03:44,587
We were all working our way up call sheets to sign clients.

770
01:03:44,797 --> 01:03:47,095
-From the bottom to the top.    -Yes,sir.

771
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:49,996
-From the doorman to the CEO.    -Okay.

772
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:53,398
They'd stay till 7,but I had Christopher.

773
01:03:53,606 --> 01:03:56,632
I had to do in six hours what they do in nine.

774
01:03:56,843 --> 01:03:59,971
Good afternoon,my name is Chris Gardner. I'm calling from Dean Witter.

775
01:04:00,179 --> 01:04:01,771
In order not to waste any time...

776
01:04:01,981 --> 01:04:04,176
...I wasrt hanging up the phone in between calls.

777
01:04:04,383 --> 01:04:06,442
Okay,thank you very much.

778
01:04:08,054 --> 01:04:10,215
I realized that by not hanging up the phone...

779
01:04:10,423 --> 01:04:12,391
...I gained another eight minutes a day.

780
01:04:12,592 --> 01:04:14,822
Why,good morning to you,my name is Chris Gardner.

781
01:04:15,027 --> 01:04:17,552
-I'm calling from Dean Witter.    -I wasrt drinking water...

782
01:04:17,763 --> 01:04:19,788
...so I didn't ' waste any time in the bathroom.

783
01:04:19,999 --> 01:04:22,194
Yes,I'd love to have the opportunity...

784
01:04:22,401 --> 01:04:25,461
Okay,no problem at all,sir. Thank you very much.

785
01:04:25,671 --> 01:04:27,002
But even doing all this...

786
01:04:27,206 --> 01:04:31,302
...after two months,I still didn't have time to work my way up a sheet.

787
01:04:44,523 --> 01:04:47,048
We're feeling really confident about that one as well.

788
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:48,454
Walter Ribbor office.

789
01:04:48,694 --> 01:04:51,857
Yes,hello,my name is Chris Gardner. I'm calling for Mr. Walter Ribbon.

790
01:04:52,064 --> 01:04:53,224
-Concerning?-Yes,ma'am.

791
01:04:53,432 --> 01:04:54,763
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

792
01:04:54,967 --> 01:04:56,662
Just a moment.

793
01:04:58,571 --> 01:05:00,300
-Hello?-Mr. Ribbon.

794
01:05:00,506 --> 01:05:03,475
Hello,sir. My name's Chris Gardner. I'm calling from Dean Witter.

795
01:05:03,676 --> 01:05:05,405
-Yeah,Chris.    -Yes,Mr. Ribbon...

796
01:05:05,611 --> 01:05:09,012
...I would love to have the opportunity to discuss some of our products.

797
01:05:09,215 --> 01:05:11,649
I'm certain that I could be of some assistance to you.

798
01:05:11,851 --> 01:05:13,682
Can you be here in 20 minutes?

799
01:05:14,987 --> 01:05:17,922
-Twenty minutes. Absolutely.    -Just had someone cancel.

800
01:05:18,124 --> 01:05:20,217
I can give you a few minutes before the 49ers.

801
01:05:20,426 --> 01:05:23,554
-Monday Night football,buddy.    -Yes,sir. Thank you very much.

802
01:05:23,763 --> 01:05:26,061
-See you soon.    -Bye-bye.

803
01:05:28,701 --> 01:05:30,794
Excuse me. Thank you.

804
01:05:31,003 --> 01:05:32,561
-Chris,what's up?-Hey,Mr. Frakesh.

805
01:05:32,772 --> 01:05:34,069
Hey,do you have five minutes?

806
01:05:34,273 --> 01:05:35,968
I got a green light from Walter Ribbon...

807
01:05:36,175 --> 01:05:39,235
I'm supposed to present commodities to Bromer. Could you move my car?

808
01:05:39,445 --> 01:05:42,710
That'd really help me out. It's on Samson,half block,silver Caprice.

809
01:05:42,915 --> 01:05:46,112
Just move it to the other side. They're street sweeping. There's spaces.

810
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,879
Hang on to these. I have backups in my desk.

811
01:05:49,088 --> 01:05:50,578
And you have to jimmy that.

812
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:52,781
-Jimmy what?-You have to jimmy the key.

813
01:05:52,992 --> 01:05:57,656
And the other doors don't unlock. You have to jimmy it.

814
01:06:13,846 --> 01:06:15,575
Come on,I'm jimmying it.

815
01:06:18,818 --> 01:06:20,251
Oh,no!

816
01:06:21,587 --> 01:06:23,020
Come on.

817
01:06:36,068 --> 01:06:38,093
-Here's the file,Mr. Ribbon.    -Thank you.

818
01:06:43,042 --> 01:06:45,806
-Thanks a lot.    -Oh,yeah,thanks. Great idea.

819
01:06:50,116 --> 01:06:53,085
No,no,no!

820
01:07:03,195 --> 01:07:05,959
Rachel,get Ristuccia on the phone for me,please.

821
01:07:54,447 --> 01:07:55,607
-Hi.    -Hi.

822
01:07:55,815 --> 01:07:58,409
I'm Chris Gardner. I have an appointment with Mr. Ribbon.

823
01:07:58,617 --> 01:08:00,016
Oh,you just missed him.

824
01:08:02,621 --> 01:08:04,145
Thank you.

825
01:08:28,247 --> 01:08:32,149
-What's that?-Just filling out a check...

826
01:08:32,351 --> 01:08:34,842
...paying some bills...

827
01:08:35,054 --> 01:08:37,079
...and a parking ticket.

828
01:08:38,958 --> 01:08:41,017
We don't have a car anymore.

829
01:08:41,227 --> 01:08:43,457
Yep,I know.

830
01:08:46,966 --> 01:08:50,026
I'm gonna need to take you with me this weekend.

831
01:08:50,236 --> 01:08:52,500
A couple of doctors' offices.

832
01:08:52,938 --> 01:08:56,806
-On sales calls,okay?-Okay.

833
01:08:59,712 --> 01:09:03,705
Then,possibly,we'll go to the football game.

834
01:09:03,916 --> 01:09:06,749
-Really?-Possibly.

835
01:09:07,186 --> 01:09:09,620
-All right?-All right.

836
01:09:09,822 --> 01:09:11,915
Come on,finish up.

837
01:09:12,424 --> 01:09:15,393
-Are you sure?-Possibly.

838
01:09:16,595 --> 01:09:18,187
Really?

839
01:09:48,127 --> 01:09:52,655
-Are you bringing it to the game?-Yeah,I don't wanna leave it.

840
01:09:52,865 --> 01:09:55,834
And maybe we're going to the game.

841
01:09:57,336 --> 01:10:01,295
-Where are we going now?-To see someone about my job.

842
01:10:01,674 --> 01:10:03,369
I don't understand.

843
01:10:03,576 --> 01:10:06,773
-You don't understand what?-Are we going to the game?

844
01:10:06,979 --> 01:10:09,504
I said possibly we're going to the game.

845
01:10:09,715 --> 01:10:12,081
-You know what "possibly" means?-Like probably.

846
01:10:12,284 --> 01:10:14,912
No,"probably" means there's a good chance that we're going.

847
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,850
"Possibly" means we might,we might not.

848
01:10:18,057 --> 01:10:21,117
-What does "probably" mean?-It means we have a good chance.

849
01:10:21,327 --> 01:10:22,692
And what does "possibly" mean?

850
01:10:22,895 --> 01:10:25,363
-I know what it means.    -What does it mean?

851
01:10:25,564 --> 01:10:28,124
It means that we're not going to the game.

852
01:10:29,802 --> 01:10:33,067
-How did you get so smart?-Because you're smart.

853
01:10:38,143 --> 01:10:40,907
-Are we there?-Yeah.

854
01:10:46,418 --> 01:10:47,976
-Mr. Ribbon.    -Yes?

855
01:10:48,187 --> 01:10:51,088
How are you,sir?Chris Gardner. Dean Witter.

856
01:10:51,624 --> 01:10:54,058
-Oh,hi. Hi.    -This is my son,Christopher.

857
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:55,784
-Hi.    -Hey,Christopher.

858
01:10:55,995 --> 01:10:58,395
-What are you doing up here?-I came to apologize...

859
01:10:58,597 --> 01:11:01,259
...for missing our appointment.    -You didn't need to come up.

860
01:11:01,467 --> 01:11:04,061
We were in the neighborhood visiting a very close friend...

861
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:07,797
...and I wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you for your time.

862
01:11:08,007 --> 01:11:10,840
-I know you probably waited for me.    -Little bit.

863
01:11:11,043 --> 01:11:13,568
I want you to know that I do not take that for granted.

864
01:11:13,779 --> 01:11:15,838
Oh,come on. What's that?

865
01:11:16,048 --> 01:11:19,506
Oh,it's an Osteo National bone-density scanner.

866
01:11:20,352 --> 01:11:23,253
A company I bought into prior to going to work at Witter.

867
01:11:23,489 --> 01:11:26,117
-I have a meeting after the game.    -You're going to the game?

868
01:11:26,325 --> 01:11:28,088
-Yeah.    -Possibly.

869
01:11:29,128 --> 01:11:30,493
-Possibly.    -We're going too.

870
01:11:30,696 --> 01:11:32,357
I'm taking my son,Tim. My 12-year-old.

871
01:11:32,564 --> 01:11:33,690
We were just leaving. Tim!

872
01:11:33,966 --> 01:11:35,900
Listen,we'll get out of your way.

873
01:11:36,101 --> 01:11:38,831
Again,thank you very much,and I'm sorry about the other day.

874
01:11:39,038 --> 01:11:41,097
And I hope that we can reschedule for later.

875
01:11:41,307 --> 01:11:42,831
-You got it.    -Thank you very much.

876
01:11:43,042 --> 01:11:44,703
You take care. Here,come on.

877
01:11:44,910 --> 01:11:46,241
-Say bye-bye,Chris.    -Bye.

878
01:11:46,445 --> 01:11:48,072
Bye,Christopher.

879
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:49,804
Hey,you guys wanna come with us?

880
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:52,950
-What...?To Candlestick?-We're going now. Come with us.

881
01:11:53,152 --> 01:11:56,315
-Where are your seats?-We've... We're upper deck.

882
01:11:56,522 --> 01:11:57,750
We got a box. Come on.

883
01:11:57,956 --> 01:12:00,117
-You wanna sit in the box?-No.

884
01:12:01,293 --> 01:12:05,252
It's not actually a box. It's,you know,a private section.

885
01:12:05,464 --> 01:12:07,932
It's more comfortable. You wanna go?

886
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:12,331
-Okay.    -Okay,kids in the back.

887
01:12:12,938 --> 01:12:15,168
Hey,why don't you just put that in your car?

888
01:12:17,843 --> 01:12:20,812
-Yeah,okay. Sure,sure.    -We don't have a car.

889
01:12:21,714 --> 01:12:23,909
-Oh,my...    -What happened?

890
01:12:24,116 --> 01:12:25,481
I think I got stung by a bee.

891
01:12:25,684 --> 01:12:28,619
-You all right?-Oh,yeah. Goodness. I'm fine.

892
01:12:28,821 --> 01:12:31,415
-You're not allergic or anything?-No,no,no.

893
01:12:31,623 --> 01:12:34,956
-Where'd he get you?-Just right at the back of my head.

894
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,594
-Are you okay?-Yeah,I'm fine,Christopher.

895
01:12:37,796 --> 01:12:39,923
-Does it hurt?-Christopher,I'm fine.

896
01:12:40,132 --> 01:12:44,000
-Let me see.    -Christopher,sit back. Sit back.

897
01:12:44,203 --> 01:12:46,569
Thomas Jefferson mentions happiness a couple times...

898
01:12:46,772 --> 01:12:49,570
...in the Declaration of Independence.

899
01:12:50,008 --> 01:12:52,568
May seem like a strange word to be in that document...

900
01:12:52,778 --> 01:12:57,715
...but he was sort of... He was an artist.

901
01:12:57,950 --> 01:13:02,512
He called the English "the disturbers of our harmony."

902
01:13:02,821 --> 01:13:04,584
And I remember standing there that day...

903
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:07,088
...thinking about the disturbers of mine.

904
01:13:07,292 --> 01:13:11,558
Questions I had: Whether all this was good.

905
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:13,693
Whether I'd make it.

906
01:13:16,702 --> 01:13:19,694
And Walter Ribbon and his Pacific Bell pension money...

907
01:13:19,905 --> 01:13:21,270
...which was millions.

908
01:13:21,473 --> 01:13:23,100
Yeah!

909
01:13:23,542 --> 01:13:26,477
It was a way to another place.

910
01:13:27,212 --> 01:13:29,339
Wow,this is...

911
01:13:29,715 --> 01:13:31,683
This is the way to watch a football game here.

912
01:13:31,884 --> 01:13:34,978
-Thank you very much for this,really.    -Hey,it's my pleasure,Chris.

913
01:13:35,187 --> 01:13:38,452
And,Mr. Ribbon,I also wanna thank you for giving me the opportunity...

914
01:13:38,657 --> 01:13:41,524
...to discuss the asset management capabilities of Dean Witter...

915
01:13:41,827 --> 01:13:43,988
...which we believe to be far superior...

916
01:13:44,196 --> 01:13:46,790
...to anything you got going over at Morgan Stanley.

917
01:13:46,999 --> 01:13:48,830
Really,I think you're gonna be blown away.

918
01:13:49,334 --> 01:13:54,067
Point blank,Dean Witter needs to be managing your retirement portfolio.

919
01:13:54,273 --> 01:13:56,833
You know,I didn't have any notion that you were new there.

920
01:13:57,042 --> 01:14:00,500
I like you,but there's not a chance I'm gonna let you direct our fund.

921
01:14:00,712 --> 01:14:02,805
That's just not gonna happen anytime soon,buddy.

922
01:14:03,015 --> 01:14:06,143
So,you know,come on,relax. Let's play the game. Go,go,go!

923
01:14:07,085 --> 01:14:08,382
Yes!

924
01:14:11,390 --> 01:14:13,449
Yes!Yeah!

925
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:19,188
-Here you go.    -All right.

926
01:14:19,398 --> 01:14:21,161
I've had a few ideas already,absolutely.

927
01:14:21,366 --> 01:14:23,926
-Chris,I'll talk to you later.    -I'm gonna give you a call.

928
01:14:24,136 --> 01:14:25,831
Nice to meet you,Chris. Give me a call.

929
01:14:26,038 --> 01:14:27,630
Yes,absolutely. Thank you.

930
01:14:34,446 --> 01:14:37,210
-Bye.    -Bye,Christopher.

931
01:15:06,712 --> 01:15:11,240
After four months,we had sold all our scanners.

932
01:15:12,518 --> 01:15:13,917
It seemed we were making it.

933
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:16,082
What's the...

934
01:15:16,455 --> 01:15:18,946
...fastest animal in the world?-Jackrabbit.

935
01:15:21,159 --> 01:15:24,595
It seemed we were doing good.

936
01:15:24,796 --> 01:15:26,559
Till one day...

937
01:15:26,798 --> 01:15:28,493
...that day...

938
01:15:29,067 --> 01:15:31,001
...that letter brought me back to earth.

939
01:15:38,377 --> 01:15:40,971
This part of my life is called "Paying Taxes."

940
01:15:43,015 --> 01:15:44,346
If you didn't pay them...

941
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:47,485
...the government could stick their hands into your bank account...

942
01:15:48,153 --> 01:15:49,381
...and take your money.

943
01:15:49,588 --> 01:15:50,555
Dad.

944
01:15:50,756 --> 01:15:52,747
No warning. Nothing.

945
01:15:52,958 --> 01:15:56,086
It can't be too late. That's my money.

946
01:15:56,295 --> 01:15:59,423
How is somebody just gonna just take my money?

947
01:15:59,731 --> 01:16:01,028
I was... I was...

948
01:16:01,233 --> 01:16:04,566
Listen,l... That's all the money that I have.

949
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:09,070
You cannot go into my bank acc... No...

950
01:16:09,274 --> 01:16:11,640
It was the 25th of September.

951
01:16:11,843 --> 01:16:13,538
I remember that day.

952
01:16:13,745 --> 01:16:15,838
Because that' the day that I found out...

953
01:16:16,048 --> 01:16:21,179
...there was only 21 dollars and 33 cents left in my bank account.

954
01:16:21,386 --> 01:16:23,081
I was broke.

955
01:16:33,432 --> 01:16:35,764
-Dressed yet?-No.

956
01:16:39,638 --> 01:16:42,971
Chris!Chris!Don't jerk me around,okay,Chris?

957
01:16:43,175 --> 01:16:45,939
I'm not jerking you around,Ralph,all right?I'm gonna get it.

958
01:16:46,144 --> 01:16:49,705
-I need that money now,not later.    -When I get it,you get it,Ralph.

959
01:16:49,915 --> 01:16:51,815
Now!

960
01:16:55,454 --> 01:16:57,547
Hey,what's happening,man?

961
01:16:57,789 --> 01:17:00,656
Wayne,I need to get that $ 14 from you.

962
01:17:02,327 --> 01:17:04,192
I thought I didn't owe you that now.

963
01:17:04,396 --> 01:17:07,456
-What?Why?-Why what?

964
01:17:07,666 --> 01:17:10,032
Why would you think you don't owe me my money?

965
01:17:10,235 --> 01:17:12,203
I helped you move.

966
01:17:14,439 --> 01:17:17,340
You drove me two blocks,Wayne.

967
01:17:17,542 --> 01:17:19,305
That's 200 yards.

968
01:17:19,511 --> 01:17:21,445
It's been four months,Wayne.

969
01:17:21,647 --> 01:17:25,242
I need my money. I need my money. I need my money right now.

970
01:17:25,450 --> 01:17:27,782
-I don't have it,man. I'm sorry.    -Go get my money.

971
01:17:27,986 --> 01:17:30,216
-Wayne,get my mo...    -I really don't,man. It's $ 14.

972
01:17:30,422 --> 01:17:32,117
It's my $ 14!Go get my money!

973
01:17:32,324 --> 01:17:34,884
-All of this for $ 14.    -Get my money,Wayne.

974
01:17:53,245 --> 01:17:55,406
Dad,look at me!

975
01:17:55,847 --> 01:17:57,576
Dad.

976
01:17:58,583 --> 01:18:02,110
-Should I go?-Sure,man. Why not?

977
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:19,228
-Stay here.    -Dad,look.

978
01:18:19,438 --> 01:18:21,030
-No,no. Stay right here.    -Dad.

979
01:18:21,239 --> 01:18:24,003
Did you hear what I said?Did you hear me?

980
01:18:29,114 --> 01:18:32,606
-Dad,where you going?-Hey,what did I say?

981
01:18:35,654 --> 01:18:37,281
Dad!

982
01:18:37,489 --> 01:18:40,890
Dad,wait!Dad!

983
01:18:49,034 --> 01:18:51,093
-Dad.    -I gotta...

984
01:18:51,303 --> 01:18:54,670
I gotta get back to the '60s,man. That's what I wanna do.

985
01:18:54,873 --> 01:18:59,173
When I was younger. I wanna see Jimi Hendrix do that guitar on fire.

986
01:19:02,247 --> 01:19:04,943
Bring back my time machine!

987
01:19:06,284 --> 01:19:07,945
Bring my time machine back!

988
01:19:16,828 --> 01:19:20,423
-Dad,where are we going?-Just be quiet.

989
01:19:21,032 --> 01:19:23,762
Go get your things. Go.

990
01:19:46,958 --> 01:19:48,653
-Chris?-Yes.

991
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:52,762
Dr. Telm can't get back to meet you. I'm sorry.

992
01:20:03,942 --> 01:20:06,410
Where are we going now?

993
01:20:07,179 --> 01:20:10,444
Gotta... We gotta see somebody else.

994
01:20:12,551 --> 01:20:14,678
I'm tired.

995
01:20:16,688 --> 01:20:18,315
I know.

996
01:20:25,697 --> 01:20:29,793
Doesrt seem to be functioning right now.

997
01:20:30,235 --> 01:20:32,533
-I have to go now,Chris.    -No,no,no.

998
01:20:32,737 --> 01:20:36,605
Just give me a second. I'm sure I'm gonna be able to figure it out.

999
01:20:38,410 --> 01:20:40,708
Chris. Chris,just come back when it's working.

1000
01:20:40,912 --> 01:20:43,745
-No,no. I have to fix it now.    -No.

1001
01:20:43,949 --> 01:20:49,182
Look,I'll still be putting money in the office,then,all right?

1002
01:20:49,387 --> 01:20:51,514
I really have to go,Chris.

1003
01:20:52,724 --> 01:20:54,419
Thank you. Thank you.

1004
01:20:54,626 --> 01:20:56,491
Thank you for your time. I appreciate it.

1005
01:20:56,695 --> 01:20:58,390
I'll see you soon.

1006
01:21:50,382 --> 01:21:52,816
Why are our things here?

1007
01:21:53,818 --> 01:21:55,445
Dad.

1008
01:22:37,963 --> 01:22:40,693
-Let's go. Come on.    -Where?

1009
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:44,632
-Just out of here.    -Why?

1010
01:22:44,836 --> 01:22:47,828
-We can't stay here tonight.    -Yes,we can. Open the door!

1011
01:22:48,039 --> 01:22:51,008
-Did you hear what I said?Let's go.    -Open the door!

1012
01:22:52,711 --> 01:22:56,579
Hey,did you hear what I said?Stop it.

1013
01:22:56,781 --> 01:22:58,271
Stop it.

1014
01:23:02,487 --> 01:23:03,977
Come on.

1015
01:23:13,064 --> 01:23:14,554
Come on.

1016
01:23:31,549 --> 01:23:33,210
Wayne!

1017
01:23:34,285 --> 01:23:36,185
Wayne!

1018
01:23:43,361 --> 01:23:45,693
Wayne!

1019
01:24:01,212 --> 01:24:04,943
Get up. Stand up. Come on.

1020
01:24:20,799 --> 01:24:22,824
Where are we going?

1021
01:24:25,003 --> 01:24:28,336
-Dad,where are we going?-I don't know.

1022
01:24:43,822 --> 01:24:46,222
It's not a time machine.

1023
01:24:46,424 --> 01:24:47,857
Dad.

1024
01:24:48,226 --> 01:24:49,557
It's not a time machine.

1025
01:24:49,761 --> 01:24:53,026
The guy said it was a time machine. It's not a time machine. He was wrong.

1026
01:24:53,431 --> 01:24:55,797
-What guy?-The guy. He was at the park.

1027
01:24:56,034 --> 01:24:57,934
He said it was a time machine.

1028
01:25:04,242 --> 01:25:05,504
Yes,it is.

1029
01:25:07,078 --> 01:25:08,875
No,it's not.

1030
01:25:10,882 --> 01:25:12,850
-It is.    -No,it's not.

1031
01:25:19,057 --> 01:25:23,585
All we gotta do is push this black button right here.

1032
01:25:26,764 --> 01:25:27,924
Wanna push it?

1033
01:25:32,437 --> 01:25:34,098
Okay.

1034
01:25:35,673 --> 01:25:37,231
Come on.

1035
01:25:38,743 --> 01:25:40,370
Come on,man.

1036
01:25:46,050 --> 01:25:47,108
Right here.

1037
01:25:47,519 --> 01:25:49,111
Wait a minute. Where you wanna go?

1038
01:25:49,454 --> 01:25:51,479
I don't know. Some place from before.

1039
01:25:52,023 --> 01:25:53,251
You gotta close your eyes.

1040
01:25:53,558 --> 01:25:55,423
You close your eyes. I wanna see.

1041
01:25:57,595 --> 01:26:00,029
All right,come on. We'll push it together.

1042
01:26:05,803 --> 01:26:07,634
You gotta close your eyes. Close your eyes.

1043
01:26:08,339 --> 01:26:10,534
It takes a few seconds.

1044
01:26:12,944 --> 01:26:14,844
Oh,my goodness.

1045
01:26:15,046 --> 01:26:17,241
Open,open,open!

1046
01:26:20,618 --> 01:26:23,280
-What is it?-Dinosaurs.

1047
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:25,683
-Where?-You don't see all these dinosaurs?

1048
01:26:27,058 --> 01:26:30,721
Look around. Look at all these dinosaurs.

1049
01:26:32,463 --> 01:26:34,863
-Can you see them?-Yeah.

1050
01:26:35,066 --> 01:26:36,465
Wait. Come on,come on.

1051
01:26:36,668 --> 01:26:37,999
-Wait,watch out.    -What is it?

1052
01:26:38,203 --> 01:26:40,262
Don't step in the fire. We're cavemen.

1053
01:26:40,605 --> 01:26:42,869
We need this fire,because there's no electricity...

1054
01:26:43,074 --> 01:26:44,473
...and it's cold out here,okay?

1055
01:26:45,176 --> 01:26:47,542
-Watch out!-Whoa!Oh,my good... A T. Rex.

1056
01:26:47,745 --> 01:26:51,374
Get your stuff. Get your stuff. Get it.

1057
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:55,444
-We gotta find someplace safe.    -Like what?

1058
01:26:55,653 --> 01:26:57,621
We need a cave.

1059
01:26:57,822 --> 01:26:58,914
A cave?

1060
01:26:59,123 --> 01:27:01,148
-We gotta find a cave. Come on.    -Okay.

1061
01:27:01,359 --> 01:27:03,122
Come on,come on.

1062
01:27:04,696 --> 01:27:06,095
Watch your back!Look out.

1063
01:27:06,297 --> 01:27:08,322
Here it is. Here's a cave. Come on.

1064
01:27:08,533 --> 01:27:11,434
Right here,right here. Go,go,go.

1065
01:27:11,636 --> 01:27:12,864
Go ahead. Get in.

1066
01:27:13,071 --> 01:27:14,936
Hurry,hurry,hurry.

1067
01:27:18,543 --> 01:27:22,309
-Are we safe?-Yeah,I think so.

1068
01:28:30,281 --> 01:28:31,908
Hey.

1069
01:28:33,484 --> 01:28:35,145
-How you doing,Jay?-I'm doing good.

1070
01:28:35,353 --> 01:28:36,786
How are you getting along?

1071
01:28:36,988 --> 01:28:39,183
-Good. I'm good.    -You doing good?

1072
01:28:39,390 --> 01:28:41,915
-How you doing?-I'm doing great.

1073
01:28:43,061 --> 01:28:44,688
Where you going?

1074
01:28:47,965 --> 01:28:50,991
L... Sacramento.

1075
01:28:51,669 --> 01:28:54,297
Because I'm trying to move a couple guys from...

1076
01:28:54,505 --> 01:28:57,133
They're at PacBell,and I'm trying to bring them over...

1077
01:28:57,342 --> 01:28:58,604
Get them over to us.

1078
01:28:58,810 --> 01:29:00,539
So they got me going out there golfing.

1079
01:29:00,745 --> 01:29:02,576
Awesome.

1080
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:04,748
Hey,let them win a round.

1081
01:29:09,921 --> 01:29:11,912
Deborah,someone's asking for you.

1082
01:29:12,123 --> 01:29:15,217
-Where?-He's outside. Please come with me.

1083
01:29:23,067 --> 01:29:24,625
Hi.

1084
01:29:27,972 --> 01:29:30,497
-Can I ask you a question?-Sure.

1085
01:29:32,744 --> 01:29:34,371
We need a room.

1086
01:29:34,979 --> 01:29:37,948
Just until I can fix this and sell it.

1087
01:29:38,149 --> 01:29:40,777
-There's just some glass work.    -Let me stop you right there.

1088
01:29:40,985 --> 01:29:43,453
-I wish I could help you...    -This is my son,Christopher.

1089
01:29:43,788 --> 01:29:45,779
-He's 5 years old.    -Hi,baby.

1090
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:49,050
-We need some place to stay.    -Okay,and I would love to help you...

1091
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:52,127
...but we don't take men here. It's only women and children.

1092
01:29:52,330 --> 01:29:55,390
He can stay here,but you have to find someplace else to go.

1093
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:56,999
We gotta stay together.

1094
01:29:57,201 --> 01:29:58,566
We got... We're...

1095
01:29:58,770 --> 01:30:00,601
-Okay,listen.    -You gotta have some place...

1096
01:30:00,805 --> 01:30:03,672
Try Glide Memorial. The building books up at 5.

1097
01:30:03,875 --> 01:30:05,365
So you hurry up. There's a line.

1098
01:30:05,576 --> 01:30:08,977
-And where is it?Come on.    -Ellis and Jones.

1099
01:30:44,215 --> 01:30:49,847
Hey,everybody. We have four spots left,and that's all.

1100
01:30:50,254 --> 01:30:53,155
-Man.    -Hey,come on,man.

1101
01:30:53,357 --> 01:30:54,551
-Come on.    -Come on,what?

1102
01:30:54,759 --> 01:30:56,351
-Hey,that's my spot.    -Back off.

1103
01:30:56,561 --> 01:30:58,995
Come on,don't do this to me. Don't...

1104
01:31:01,365 --> 01:31:02,923
Dad!

1105
01:31:03,367 --> 01:31:05,426
Stop it!Break it up!Break it up!

1106
01:31:05,636 --> 01:31:07,228
Stop!Stop!

1107
01:31:07,438 --> 01:31:09,736
Get out of the line,both of you. Both of you.

1108
01:31:09,941 --> 01:31:12,535
I was here first. They told me that we had to be on time.

1109
01:31:12,844 --> 01:31:14,778
I got here on time. I was in line.

1110
01:31:14,979 --> 01:31:16,742
I came from work,I got my son.

1111
01:31:16,948 --> 01:31:19,473
I was here on time. We were here on time!

1112
01:31:19,684 --> 01:31:21,276
He sliced in front of him in line.

1113
01:31:21,486 --> 01:31:23,784
-Who did?-He did.

1114
01:31:24,055 --> 01:31:28,583
Come on,come on,Rodney. Come on. Let's go. Get out of line.

1115
01:31:37,835 --> 01:31:39,826
That's it. No more.

1116
01:31:46,844 --> 01:31:49,813
-What's your favorite color?-Green.

1117
01:31:50,014 --> 01:31:51,276
Green?

1118
01:31:51,482 --> 01:31:54,474
-What do you like that's green?-Trees.

1119
01:31:54,685 --> 01:31:57,677
Trees. What else?

1120
01:31:57,889 --> 01:31:59,356
Holly.

1121
01:32:01,125 --> 01:32:05,084
-Holly. What's holly?-The Christmas stuff.

1122
01:32:05,830 --> 01:32:07,821
Christmas stuff.

1123
01:32:08,633 --> 01:32:10,396
What's that?

1124
01:32:13,604 --> 01:32:16,505
I guess they want us to go to sleep.

1125
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:28,074
Here you go. We gotta make sure Captain America's warm in there.

1126
01:32:28,519 --> 01:32:30,248
Can you breathe?

1127
01:32:30,454 --> 01:32:32,718
-You're good?-Yeah.

1128
01:32:33,157 --> 01:32:35,148
-I gotta go work on the scanner...    -Don't go.

1129
01:32:35,359 --> 01:32:38,556
No,no,no. I'm gonna be right outside the door.

1130
01:32:38,763 --> 01:32:42,893
All right?I'm just gonna be right there. I'll leave the door open a little bit.

1131
01:32:43,367 --> 01:32:46,063
And I'll be able to hear you if you call me.

1132
01:32:46,270 --> 01:32:48,761
I wanna go home.

1133
01:32:50,841 --> 01:32:54,641
But that's why I gotta work on the scanner.

1134
01:32:55,580 --> 01:32:57,343
All right?

1135
01:32:57,548 --> 01:32:59,482
I'm gonna go out there.

1136
01:32:59,684 --> 01:33:03,051
I'm gonna leave the door open. I'll be right up the stairs.

1137
01:33:04,155 --> 01:33:05,850
I'll be able to hear you if you call me.

1138
01:33:06,824 --> 01:33:08,951
-All right?-All right.

1139
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:11,492
You gotta trust me,okay?

1140
01:33:11,696 --> 01:33:13,721
You gotta trust me.

1141
01:33:14,599 --> 01:33:17,261
I trust you. I trust you.

1142
01:33:17,468 --> 01:33:18,901
I trust you.

1143
01:33:19,103 --> 01:33:22,095
-I can't hear you.    -I trust you. I trust you.

1144
01:33:25,910 --> 01:33:27,639
Give me a kiss.

1145
01:33:40,291 --> 01:33:43,260
-I'll just be a little while,okay?-All right.

1146
01:33:43,728 --> 01:33:46,196
-I'll be right here.    -Okay.

1147
01:33:46,397 --> 01:33:48,592
-Can you still hear me?-Yeah.

1148
01:33:48,799 --> 01:33:50,289
-Can you hear me?-Yeah.

1149
01:33:50,534 --> 01:33:53,002
-Do you trust me?-Yeah.

1150
01:34:40,217 --> 01:34:41,878
-Yeah.    -Like that?

1151
01:34:42,086 --> 01:34:45,749
-Yeah,put that...    -Then you go like that.

1152
01:34:45,956 --> 01:34:49,448
-Is that okay?-I don't know. What do you think?

1153
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:50,718
Good.

1154
01:34:52,063 --> 01:34:54,293
Let's go. Get your stuff.

1155
01:34:55,533 --> 01:34:58,502
-Hey,why don't you leave it?-We can't.

1156
01:34:58,703 --> 01:35:00,830
We're gonna have a different room later.

1157
01:35:01,038 --> 01:35:02,596
Go.

1158
01:35:07,945 --> 01:35:09,310
Hey,Chris.

1159
01:35:09,513 --> 01:35:12,846
-Hey,good morning,Mr. Frakesh.    -What's up?

1160
01:35:13,884 --> 01:35:15,044
Work trip.

1161
01:35:15,252 --> 01:35:17,516
Your wife,Martha,works at PacBell also,correct?

1162
01:35:17,722 --> 01:35:19,485
-Yes,she does.    -And you guys are both...

1163
01:35:19,690 --> 01:35:21,351
...Iooking to retire at the same time?

1164
01:35:21,559 --> 01:35:23,652
We'd like to retire and maintain our lifestyle...

1165
01:35:23,861 --> 01:35:25,294
...without paying a lot of taxes.

1166
01:35:25,496 --> 01:35:28,988
So basically,you want nobody's hands in your pockets but your own?

1167
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:31,500
Are you familiar with tax-free municipal...

1168
01:35:31,702 --> 01:35:33,602
I learned to finish my work quickly.

1169
01:35:33,904 --> 01:35:36,099
I had to finish quickly.

1170
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:39,932
To get in line at Glide by 5.

1171
01:35:43,647 --> 01:35:45,581
Come on.

1172
01:35:46,050 --> 01:35:47,642
Come on.

1173
01:35:51,722 --> 01:35:54,520
Hold that bus!Hold the bus!

1174
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:57,155
My Captain America!

1175
01:35:57,394 --> 01:35:59,692
Dad!Dad!Dad!

1176
01:35:59,897 --> 01:36:03,162
Stop it!Shut up!Shut up!

1177
01:36:05,503 --> 01:36:07,528
-Why don't you let the lady in?-Hey,back up.

1178
01:36:07,738 --> 01:36:10,798
-Hey,man,that's not cool.    -Back up!Back up!

1179
01:36:19,116 --> 01:36:20,583
Come on.

1180
01:36:23,587 --> 01:36:25,817
Dad,we need to get it!

1181
01:36:28,425 --> 01:36:31,053
The important thing about that freedom train...

1182
01:36:31,262 --> 01:36:33,423
...is it' got to climb mountains.

1183
01:36:33,631 --> 01:36:36,395
We all have to deal with mountains.

1184
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:39,535
You know,mountains that go way up high.

1185
01:36:39,937 --> 01:36:41,962
And mountains that go deep and low.

1186
01:36:42,173 --> 01:36:43,435
-Amen,preacher!-Yes.

1187
01:36:43,641 --> 01:36:45,939
We know what those mountains are,here at Glide.

1188
01:36:46,243 --> 01:36:48,370
We sing about them.

1189
01:36:49,146 --> 01:36:54,675
Lord,don't move that mountain

1190
01:36:56,086 --> 01:37:02,514
Give me strength to climb it

1191
01:37:03,027 --> 01:37:09,694
Please don't move That stumbling block

1192
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:16,464
But lead me,Lord,around it

1193
01:37:18,108 --> 01:37:23,136
My burdens,they get so heavy

1194
01:37:24,982 --> 01:37:30,614
Seems hard to bear

1195
01:37:31,555 --> 01:37:35,116
But I won't give up No,no

1196
01:37:35,326 --> 01:37:37,351
Because you promised me

1197
01:37:37,561 --> 01:37:44,296
You'd meet me at the altar of prayer

1198
01:37:44,501 --> 01:37:52,033
-Lord don't move that mountain    -Please don't move that mountain

1199
01:37:52,243 --> 01:37:57,510
But give me strength to climb it

1200
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:01,741
Whers your test?

1201
01:38:02,953 --> 01:38:04,443
Tomorrow.

1202
01:38:08,826 --> 01:38:10,623
Are you ready?

1203
01:38:14,531 --> 01:38:15,964
Of course.

1204
01:38:55,072 --> 01:38:56,369
Thank you,sir.

1205
01:39:05,749 --> 01:39:07,944
-Hey. How you doing?-Hey.

1206
01:39:11,956 --> 01:39:14,948
So did you finish the whole thing,or you have to go somewhere...

1207
01:39:15,159 --> 01:39:17,627
I have to go somewhere.

1208
01:39:18,195 --> 01:39:21,028
-But I finished the whole thing too.    -Oh,good.

1209
01:39:21,231 --> 01:39:23,165
-You?-Yeah.

1210
01:39:23,667 --> 01:39:26,636
-How'd you feel about the graphs?-Easy.

1211
01:39:27,638 --> 01:39:31,699
I struggled with the essay question on the back. What did you write?

1212
01:39:31,909 --> 01:39:35,538
-Essay question?-Yeah,on the back.

1213
01:39:45,456 --> 01:39:46,821
Hey,Chris.

1214
01:39:47,024 --> 01:39:50,289
-Hey. Jeff,right?49ers game.    -Yeah.

1215
01:39:50,494 --> 01:39:53,986
-Yeah,you were gonna give me a call?-I never actually got your number.

1216
01:39:55,733 --> 01:39:57,701
Here's my number. Call me,okay?

1217
01:39:57,901 --> 01:40:00,563
Yes,sir. Absolutely. Thank you very much.

1218
01:40:01,338 --> 01:40:05,104
Chris,you got five bucks?I left my wallet upstairs.

1219
01:40:05,309 --> 01:40:07,573
Let me run up and grab that for you,Mr. Frohm.

1220
01:40:07,778 --> 01:40:10,770
No,I gotta be at CAL Bank at 4,and I'm late.

1221
01:40:16,153 --> 01:40:18,314
-I'll pay you back,honest.    -Five is good?

1222
01:40:18,522 --> 01:40:22,151
Five is lovely. Thank you. Thank you.

1223
01:40:35,506 --> 01:40:37,997
That's it. That's the room quota.

1224
01:40:38,375 --> 01:40:41,139
There's no more space. You gotta head out.

1225
01:40:41,345 --> 01:40:44,246
That's it for today. Come back tomorrow.

1226
01:40:44,448 --> 01:40:47,440
All the rooms are full. It's completely full.

1227
01:40:47,651 --> 01:40:51,951
That's it. Just keep heading out. Come back tomorrow.

1228
01:41:26,924 --> 01:41:28,687
You like it?

1229
01:42:19,743 --> 01:42:23,406
Twenty. One,two,three,four.

1230
01:42:26,517 --> 01:42:30,112
Now,here's your bulb,and there's your ferrite core inductor.

1231
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:33,118
-How much?-Eight dollars.

1232
01:42:34,224 --> 01:42:37,557
-What's that?-It's to repair the light.

1233
01:42:37,761 --> 01:42:39,786
Can I see it?

1234
01:42:41,698 --> 01:42:44,758
Yeah,sure. Just don't break it.

1235
01:42:44,968 --> 01:42:49,462
Unless you wanna sleep in a room with me for the rest of your life.

1236
01:42:50,674 --> 01:42:52,539
I don't mind.

1237
01:42:53,010 --> 01:42:54,841
Yeah,you will.

1238
01:43:11,128 --> 01:43:13,494
Why don't you get some sleep,okay?

1239
01:43:13,697 --> 01:43:14,857
Okay.

1240
01:43:15,065 --> 01:43:18,159
-Warm enough?-Yeah.

1241
01:43:18,435 --> 01:43:20,096
All right.

1242
01:43:22,206 --> 01:43:25,107
Did Mom leave because of me?

1243
01:43:28,445 --> 01:43:32,643
-What?-Did Mom leave because of me?

1244
01:43:37,221 --> 01:43:41,749
Don't... Don't even think something like that.

1245
01:43:42,826 --> 01:43:44,953
Mom left because of Mom.

1246
01:43:45,162 --> 01:43:47,426
And you didn't have anything to do with that,okay?

1247
01:43:48,131 --> 01:43:50,031
Okay.

1248
01:43:59,876 --> 01:44:01,935
You're a good papa.

1249
01:44:09,786 --> 01:44:11,777
All right,go to sleep.

1250
01:44:12,589 --> 01:44:15,524
-I love you.    -I love you too.

1251
01:45:11,982 --> 01:45:13,973
So far,so good,Chris.

1252
01:45:20,057 --> 01:45:22,617
-It works.    -Thank you very much.

1253
01:45:22,826 --> 01:45:26,660
Two hundred and fifty dollars. Four more weeks of oxygen.

1254
01:45:26,997 --> 01:45:31,229
One hundred,20,40,60,80,200.

1255
01:45:31,435 --> 01:45:34,199
Twenty,30,40,50.

1256
01:45:35,339 --> 01:45:36,966
-Anything else?-No,sir.

1257
01:45:37,174 --> 01:45:38,505
Thank you. Thank you.

1258
01:45:38,709 --> 01:45:40,643
-You ready?-Yep.

1259
01:45:42,579 --> 01:45:45,480
-Are we going to the church place?-No.

1260
01:45:45,682 --> 01:45:47,650
Where are we going,then?

1261
01:45:48,452 --> 01:45:51,012
-Probably stay at a hotel.    -A hotel?

1262
01:45:51,221 --> 01:45:52,279
Just for the night.

1263
01:45:52,489 --> 01:45:55,253
We can go back to the cave if you like.

1264
01:45:55,459 --> 01:45:57,188
No,thank you.

1265
01:45:57,394 --> 01:45:59,919
-Ever?-I hope not.

1266
01:46:00,130 --> 01:46:01,597
Why not?

1267
01:46:01,798 --> 01:46:04,596
Well,because some things are fun the first time you do them...

1268
01:46:04,801 --> 01:46:07,133
...and then not so much the next.

1269
01:46:07,337 --> 01:46:10,238
-Like the bus?-Yeah,like the bus.

1270
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:13,637
I'm sorry,I shouldn't laugh,should I?

1271
01:46:26,656 --> 01:46:28,351
Sometimes when we're moving at night...

1272
01:46:28,558 --> 01:46:31,288
...we pass houses with lights and people.

1273
01:46:32,062 --> 01:46:33,927
Sometimes you can hear them laugh.

1274
01:46:39,336 --> 01:46:42,703
The next day,after work...

1275
01:46:42,906 --> 01:46:45,136
...we just went to the beach.

1276
01:46:45,342 --> 01:46:47,242
Far away from anything.

1277
01:46:47,444 --> 01:46:48,809
Everything.

1278
01:46:49,012 --> 01:46:50,673
Just Christopher and me.

1279
01:46:52,315 --> 01:46:54,681
-Did you see me?-Yeah.

1280
01:46:54,885 --> 01:46:57,979
Far away from buses and noise...

1281
01:46:58,188 --> 01:47:03,820
...and a constant disappointment in my ten-gallon head...

1282
01:47:04,995 --> 01:47:06,860
...and myself.

1283
01:47:07,464 --> 01:47:09,830
-Chris,thank you very much.    -Well,thank you,Dean.

1284
01:47:10,033 --> 01:47:11,864
-Take care.    -You made all the right moves.

1285
01:47:12,068 --> 01:47:13,592
Thanks,Chris.

1286
01:47:15,672 --> 01:47:17,003
Because when I was young...

1287
01:47:17,207 --> 01:47:20,973
...and I'd get an A on a history test or whatever...

1288
01:47:21,178 --> 01:47:25,774
...I'd get this good feeling about all the things that I could be.

1289
01:47:27,684 --> 01:47:31,313
And then I never became any of them.

1290
01:47:38,829 --> 01:47:41,354
-Hey,Chris.    -Hey.

1291
01:47:41,565 --> 01:47:44,193
-How you doing,Jay?-I'm doing fine.

1292
01:47:44,401 --> 01:47:48,531
Rumor has it you signed 31 accounts for us from Pacific Bell.

1293
01:47:48,738 --> 01:47:50,171
Yeah,yeah.

1294
01:47:50,373 --> 01:47:54,173
Met some guys at a ball game,got some cards. I've been working.

1295
01:47:54,377 --> 01:47:56,004
I guess.

1296
01:47:58,982 --> 01:48:01,212
So one more day.

1297
01:48:01,418 --> 01:48:03,010
Getting nervous?

1298
01:48:03,587 --> 01:48:05,953
-No,I'm okay.    -Yeah?

1299
01:48:06,156 --> 01:48:08,090
Listen,whatever happens...

1300
01:48:08,291 --> 01:48:10,725
...you've done a fantastic job,Chris.

1301
01:48:10,927 --> 01:48:12,485
I mean that.

1302
01:48:13,330 --> 01:48:15,161
Take care of yourself.

1303
01:48:30,146 --> 01:48:33,343
Yes,Mr. Johnson. Chris Gardner,Dean Witter.

1304
01:48:33,650 --> 01:48:35,743
Yes,sir. Just calling to thank you very much...

1305
01:48:35,952 --> 01:48:38,443
...for your support at last month's seminar.

1306
01:48:38,989 --> 01:48:40,650
Yes,sir. Absolutely.

1307
01:48:41,291 --> 01:48:42,918
Yes,sir.

1308
01:48:43,126 --> 01:48:44,491
No,sir,that's it.

1309
01:48:44,694 --> 01:48:47,185
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

1310
01:48:48,798 --> 01:48:51,665
Chris. Come.

1311
01:49:19,062 --> 01:49:22,156
-Hi,Chris.    -Mr. Frohm,good to see you.

1312
01:49:23,300 --> 01:49:25,234
-Nice shirt.    -Thank you,sir.

1313
01:49:25,435 --> 01:49:26,629
-Chris.    -Hey,Jay.

1314
01:49:27,070 --> 01:49:31,336
-Chris.    -Chris,sit down,please.

1315
01:49:34,277 --> 01:49:38,338
I thought I'd wear a shirt today.

1316
01:49:38,548 --> 01:49:40,516
You know,being the last day and all.

1317
01:49:40,717 --> 01:49:44,050
Well,thank you. Thank you. We appreciate that.

1318
01:49:44,955 --> 01:49:46,718
But...

1319
01:49:46,923 --> 01:49:49,721
...wear one tomorrow though,okay?

1320
01:49:49,926 --> 01:49:52,861
Because tomorrow's going to be your first day...

1321
01:49:53,597 --> 01:49:56,828
...if you'd like to work here as a broker.

1322
01:49:58,168 --> 01:49:59,999
Would you like that,Chris?

1323
01:50:00,904 --> 01:50:02,496
Yes,sir.

1324
01:50:02,706 --> 01:50:06,073
Good. We couldn't be happier.

1325
01:50:07,043 --> 01:50:10,206
So welcome.

1326
01:50:12,082 --> 01:50:17,076
-Was it as easy as it looked?-No,sir. No,sir,it wasrt.

1327
01:50:19,422 --> 01:50:21,822
-Good luck,Chris.    -Thank you. Thank you.

1328
01:50:28,231 --> 01:50:30,096
Oh,Chris.

1329
01:50:32,602 --> 01:50:34,695
I almost forgot.

1330
01:50:36,740 --> 01:50:38,298
Thank you.

1331
01:50:58,695 --> 01:51:00,890
This part of my life...

1332
01:51:01,798 --> 01:51:03,993
...this little part...

1333
01:51:07,337 --> 01:51:09,965
...is called "Happiness."

1334
01:51:56,686 --> 01:52:00,315
Christopher. Christopher. Come here.

1335
01:52:29,986 --> 01:52:32,386
So how many...

1336
01:52:32,589 --> 01:52:34,523
...planets are there?

1337
01:52:35,825 --> 01:52:37,622
-Seven.    -Seven?

1338
01:52:38,128 --> 01:52:39,959
Nine.

1339
01:52:42,332 --> 01:52:44,391
Who's the king of the jungle?

1340
01:52:44,801 --> 01:52:47,531
-Gorilla.    -The gorilla?

1341
01:52:47,837 --> 01:52:49,236
The gorilla?

1342
01:52:49,439 --> 01:52:51,100
No. Lion.

1343
01:52:51,307 --> 01:52:53,901
Oh,yeah. Lion,lion,lion.

1344
01:52:55,979 --> 01:52:58,971
Hey,Dad,listen to this. Knock,knock.

1345
01:52:59,182 --> 01:53:01,116
-Who's there?-Shelby.

1346
01:53:01,317 --> 01:53:02,409
Shelby who?

1347
01:53:02,619 --> 01:53:06,419
Shelby coming around the mountain When she comes

1348
01:53:07,257 --> 01:53:08,622
-Knock knock.    -Who's there?

1349
01:53:08,825 --> 01:53:11,293
-Nobody.    -Nobody who?

1350
01:53:12,195 --> 01:53:13,958
Nobody who?

1351
01:53:17,267 --> 01:53:20,236
Now,that's funny. I like that one.
