1
00:01:35,194 --> 00:01:37,094
Time to get up, man.

2
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:41,229
- All right, Dad.
- Come on.

3
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:50,932
Should be here soon.

4
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:40,578
- I think I should make a list.
- What do mean?

5
00:03:40,786 --> 00:03:43,186
- For your birthday gifts?
- Yeah.

6
00:03:43,388 --> 00:03:45,913
You know you're only getting
a couple of things, right?

7
00:03:46,124 --> 00:03:50,185
Yeah, I know. Just to look at
and study so I can choose better.

8
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:53,330
Okay, well, that's smart.
Yeah, make a list.

9
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:55,732
Can you spell everything
you're thinking of?

10
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:59,529
- I think so.
- All right. That's good.

11
00:04:03,475 --> 00:04:06,376
- How you doing in here, man?
- Okay.

12
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:16,588
Can we go to the park today, after?

13
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:20,847
No, I gotta go to Oakland.
Well, maybe, we'll see.

14
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:22,617
Give me a kiss.

15
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:25,395
I'll talk to you later.

16
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,495
Excuse me.

17
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,999
Oh, excuse me...

18
00:04:33,205 --> 00:04:35,469
...when is somebody
gonna clean this off?

19
00:04:38,477 --> 00:04:41,037
And the Y?
The Y. We talked about this.

20
00:04:41,246 --> 00:04:44,647
It's an I in "happiness."
There's no Y in "happiness." It's an I.

21
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:48,817
I'm Chris Gardner.

22
00:04:49,254 --> 00:04:52,348
I met my father for the first time
when I was 28 years old.

23
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,786
And I made up my mind
as a young kid...

24
00:04:54,993 --> 00:04:56,517
...that when I had children...

25
00:04:56,728 --> 00:05:00,061
...my children were gonna know
who their father was.

26
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:04,697
This is part of my life story.

27
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,871
This part is called "Riding the Bus."

28
00:05:15,347 --> 00:05:17,008
What's that?

29
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:19,846
It's a time machine, isn't it?

30
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:22,244
Seems like a time machine.

31
00:05:22,454 --> 00:05:25,548
That seems like a time machine.
It's a time machine. Take me with you.

32
00:05:25,757 --> 00:05:26,951
This machine...

33
00:05:27,426 --> 00:05:28,654
...this machine on my lap...

34
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,828
This guy, he has a time machine.

35
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:34,089
He travels in the past
with this machine and...

36
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:36,529
- it is not a time machine.

37
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:39,696
It's a portable
bone-density scanner.

38
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:43,167
A medical device I sell for a living.

39
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,866
Thank you for the opportunity
to discuss it with you.

40
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:48,171
- I appreciate it.
- We just don't need it, Chris.

41
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,143
It's unnecessary and expensive.

42
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,476
- Well, maybe next...
- Thank you.

43
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:58,649
It gave a slightly denser picture
than an x-ray for twice the money.

44
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,252
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.

45
00:06:03,462 --> 00:06:05,123
- What happened?
- No, nothing.

46
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,888
Look, I can't get Christopher today.

47
00:06:07,432 --> 00:06:09,627
Oh, no, you don't, Chris.
I'm back on at 7.

48
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:11,564
I know. I have got to go to Oakland.

49
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:14,938
So I gotta get Christopher home,
feed him, bathe him...

50
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,734
...get him in bed,
and be back here by 7?

51
00:06:17,943 --> 00:06:20,070
- Yes.
- And we got the tax-bill notice today.

52
00:06:20,278 --> 00:06:23,805
- What are you gonna do about that?
- Look, this is what we gotta do.

53
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,318
You see that car? The one
with the pretty yellow shoe on it?

54
00:06:32,524 --> 00:06:33,889
That's mine.

55
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:36,060
There's no parking near hospitals.

56
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:38,752
That's what happens
when you're always in a rush.

57
00:06:38,964 --> 00:06:40,864
Thanks anyway. Very much.

58
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:44,001
- Maybe next quarter.
- It's possible.

59
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:50,399
I needed to sell at least two scanners
a month for rent and daycare.

60
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:52,641
I'd have to sell one more...

61
00:06:52,844 --> 00:06:56,610
...to pay off all of those tickets
under my windshield wiper.

62
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,413
The problem is...

63
00:07:06,324 --> 00:07:08,815
...I haven't sold any for a while.

64
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:13,191
Since when do you not like
macaroni and cheese?

65
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:15,923
Since birth?

66
00:07:18,403 --> 00:07:20,428
- What's that?
- What?

67
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,733
- What is this?
- It's a gift for Christopher.

68
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:26,433
- From who?
- Cynthia from work.

69
00:07:26,645 --> 00:07:29,739
It's for adults. Chris can't use it.
She didn't know.

70
00:07:29,948 --> 00:07:31,939
What are you supposed
to do with it?

71
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:35,745
Make every side the same color.

72
00:07:37,022 --> 00:07:39,320
Did you pay the taxes?

73
00:07:39,624 --> 00:07:42,752
No, I'm gonna
have to file an extension.

74
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:47,692
- You already filed an extension.
- Yeah, well, I gotta file another one.

75
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:51,763
That's... It's $650.
I'll have it in the next month.

76
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,101
That means interest, right?

77
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:56,672
- And a penalty?
- Yeah, a little bit.

78
00:07:56,875 --> 00:08:02,507
Look, why don't you let me do this?
All right, just relax. Okay?

79
00:08:02,714 --> 00:08:06,878
- Come here. Calm down.
- I have to go back to work.

80
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:18,522
Let's get ready for bed.
Hey, put your plate in the sink.

81
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:22,166
A few days ago I was presented
with a report I'd asked for...

82
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:26,098
...a comprehensive audit, if you will,
of our economic condition.

83
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:29,501
You won't like it. I didn't like it.

84
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,369
But we have to face the truth...

85
00:08:31,576 --> 00:08:34,204
...and then go to work
to turn things around.

86
00:08:34,412 --> 00:08:38,178
And make no mistake about it,
we can turn them around.

87
00:08:38,383 --> 00:08:41,477
The federal budget is out of control.

88
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:45,053
And we face runaway deficits
of almost $80 billion...

89
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:48,693
...for this budget year
that ends September 30th.

90
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:54,127
That deficit is larger than
the entire federal budget in 1957.

91
00:08:54,332 --> 00:08:56,892
And so is the almost $80 billion...

92
00:08:57,102 --> 00:09:01,402
...we will pay in interest
this year on the national debt.

93
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,565
Twenty years ago, in 1960...

94
00:09:04,776 --> 00:09:08,940
...our federal government payroll
was less than $ 13 billion.

95
00:09:09,147 --> 00:09:11,843
Today it is 75 billion.

96
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:17,613
During these 20 years, our population
has only increased by 23.3 percent...

97
00:09:35,774 --> 00:09:38,538
Man, I got two questions for you:

98
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:41,871
What do you do?
And how do you do it?

99
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:46,475
- I'm a stockbroker.
- Stockbroker. Oh, goodness.

100
00:09:46,685 --> 00:09:48,653
Had to go to college
to be a stockbroker, huh?

101
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,617
You don't have to. Have to be good
with numbers and good with people.

102
00:09:52,824 --> 00:09:55,224
- That's it.
- Hey, you take care.

103
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:57,486
I'll let you hang on to my car
for the weekend.

104
00:09:57,696 --> 00:10:00,164
- But I need it back for Monday.
- Feed the meter.

105
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:09,739
I still remember that moment.

106
00:10:14,012 --> 00:10:18,676
They all looked
so damn happy to me.

107
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:28,257
Why couldn't I look like that?

108
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:47,209
I'm gonna try to get home by 6.

109
00:10:47,412 --> 00:10:50,540
I'm gonna stop by a brokerage firm
after work.

110
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:54,014
- For what?
- I wanna see about a job there.

111
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:56,847
Yeah? What job?

112
00:10:57,355 --> 00:10:59,380
You know, when I...

113
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:02,219
When I was a kid, I could go through
a math book in a week.

114
00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:05,760
So I'm gonna go see about
what job they got down there.

115
00:11:06,865 --> 00:11:08,799
What job?

116
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,499
Stockbroker.

117
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:19,004
- Stockbroker?
- Yeah.

118
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:21,402
Not an astronaut?

119
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:39,886
Don't talk to me like that, Linda.

120
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:44,832
I'm gonna go down and see about this,
and I'm gonna do it during the day.

121
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:46,731
You should probably
do your sales calls.

122
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:49,639
I don't need you to tell me
about my sales calls, Linda.

123
00:11:49,841 --> 00:11:53,038
I got three of them
before the damn office is even open.

124
00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:56,012
Do you remember
that rent is due next week?

125
00:11:56,214 --> 00:11:58,079
Probably not.

126
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,776
We're already two months behind.

127
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:04,011
Next week we'll owe three months.

128
00:12:04,489 --> 00:12:08,619
I've been pulling double shifts
for four months now, Chris.

129
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:13,327
Just sell what's in your contract.
Get us out of that business.

130
00:12:13,531 --> 00:12:17,228
Linda, that is what I am trying to do.

131
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:20,665
This is what I'm trying to do
for my family...

132
00:12:20,872 --> 00:12:22,237
...for you and for Christopher.

133
00:12:23,675 --> 00:12:25,768
What's the matter with you?

134
00:12:29,948 --> 00:12:31,643
Linda.

135
00:12:32,217 --> 00:12:33,741
Linda.

136
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:05,842
This part of my life
is called "Being Stupid."

137
00:13:07,886 --> 00:13:09,183
Can I ask you a favor, miss?

138
00:13:09,387 --> 00:13:13,255
Do you mind if I leave this here
with you just for five minutes?

139
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,949
I have a meeting in there
and I don't wanna carry that...

140
00:13:16,161 --> 00:13:18,186
...looking smalltime.

141
00:13:18,997 --> 00:13:23,457
Here is a dollar and I'll give you
more money when I come back out.

142
00:13:23,668 --> 00:13:26,933
Okay? It's not valuable.
You can't sell it anywhere.

143
00:13:27,872 --> 00:13:32,036
I can't even sell it, and it's my job.
All right?

144
00:13:39,717 --> 00:13:42,083
- Chris? Tim Brophy, Resources.
- Yes. How are you?

145
00:13:42,287 --> 00:13:43,618
- Come with me.
- Yes, sir.

146
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:46,586
Let me see if I can find you
an application for our internship.

147
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:50,022
I'm afraid that's all we can do for you.
See, this is a satellite office.

148
00:13:50,228 --> 00:13:52,890
Jay Twistle in the main office,
he oversees Witter Resources.

149
00:13:53,097 --> 00:13:55,190
I mean, I'm... You know,
I'm just this office.

150
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,335
As you can see, we got a hell of lot
of applications here, so...

151
00:13:58,536 --> 00:14:01,562
Normally I have a resume sheet,
but I can't seem to find it anywhere.

152
00:14:01,773 --> 00:14:05,174
- We...
- Thank you very much.

153
00:14:05,376 --> 00:14:06,536
I need to go.

154
00:14:07,145 --> 00:14:08,840
I'll bring this back.

155
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,208
- Thank you.
- Okay.

156
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:23,084
Trusting a hippie girl with my scanner.
Why did I do that?

157
00:14:23,294 --> 00:14:24,921
Excuse me. Excuse me.

158
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:30,567
Like I said, this part of my life
is called "Being Stupid."

159
00:14:33,738 --> 00:14:38,471
Hey! Hey! Hey! Don't move!
Don't move! Stay!

160
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:48,783
Stop! Stop!

161
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:52,184
Don't move!
Stop this! Stop the train!

162
00:14:53,224 --> 00:14:55,522
Stop! Stop!

163
00:15:10,441 --> 00:15:14,172
The program took just 20 people
every six months.

164
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:16,472
One got the job.

165
00:15:18,016 --> 00:15:23,386
There were three blank lines after
"high school" to list more education.

166
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:27,721
I didn't need that many lines.

167
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:35,789
Try and sleep. It's late.

168
00:15:45,777 --> 00:15:49,372
It's a puzzle measuring just 3 inches
by 3 inches on each side...

169
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,014
...made up of multiple colors
that you twist and turn...

170
00:15:52,216 --> 00:15:54,810
...and try to get
to a solid color on each side.

171
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:58,648
This little cube
is the gift sensation of 1981.

172
00:15:58,856 --> 00:16:00,255
Don't expect to solve it easily.

173
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,892
Although we did encounter
one math professor at USF...

174
00:16:03,094 --> 00:16:05,585
...who took just 30 minutes on his.

175
00:16:05,797 --> 00:16:08,027
This is as far as I've gotten
on mine.

176
00:16:08,232 --> 00:16:11,599
As you can see,
I still have a long way to go.

177
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:14,431
This is Jim Finnerty reporting
for KJSF in Richmond.

178
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,335
Hey, wake up.

179
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:19,066
Eat.

180
00:16:20,178 --> 00:16:22,646
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, baby.

181
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:25,839
- Come back without that, please.
- Oh, yeah, I'm going to.

182
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,985
So go ahead, say goodbye to it,
because I'm coming back without it.

183
00:16:29,187 --> 00:16:31,621
Goodbye and good riddance.

184
00:16:31,823 --> 00:16:33,791
You ain't had to add
the "good riddance" part.

185
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:35,050
Bye, Mom.

186
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:37,926
Bye.

187
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:41,724
It's written as P-P-Y, but it's
supposed to be an I in "happiness."

188
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:45,061
- Is it an adjective?
- No, actually it's a noun.

189
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:46,998
But it's not spelled right.

190
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:50,800
- Is "fuck" spelled right?
- Yeah, that's spelled right.

191
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:54,137
But that's not part of the motto,
so you're not supposed to learn that.

192
00:16:54,345 --> 00:16:59,248
That's an adult word to show anger
and other things.

193
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:02,317
- But just don't use that one, okay?
- Okay.

194
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,681
What's that say
on the back of your bag?

195
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,991
My nickname.

196
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:08,783
We pick nicknames.

197
00:17:08,993 --> 00:17:12,360
- Oh, yeah? What's it say?
- "Hot Rod."

198
00:17:15,366 --> 00:17:17,391
- Did you have a nickname?
- Yep.

199
00:17:17,602 --> 00:17:20,332
- What?
- "Ten-Gallon Head."

200
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:23,439
- What's that?
- I grew up in Louisiana, near Texas.

201
00:17:23,641 --> 00:17:28,271
Everybody wears cowboy hats.
And a ten-gallon's a big hat.

202
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:32,040
I was smart back then,
so they called me Ten-Gallon Head.

203
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,777
- Hoss wears that hat.
- Hoss?

204
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:36,782
Hoss Cartwright on Bonanza.

205
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:40,748
- How do you know Bonanza?
- We watch it at Mrs. Chu's.

206
00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:44,520
- You watch Bonanza at daycare?
- Yeah.

207
00:17:45,596 --> 00:17:47,655
When? When do you watch it?

208
00:17:47,865 --> 00:17:51,528
- After snack? After your nap?
- After Love Boat.

209
00:17:56,441 --> 00:17:58,602
I made my list for my birthday.

210
00:17:59,377 --> 00:18:03,905
- Yeah, what'd you put on there?
- A basketball or an ant farm.

211
00:18:07,518 --> 00:18:11,784
- He says he's been watching TV.
- Oh, little TV for history.

212
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:15,083
- Love Boat?
- For history. Navy.

213
00:18:15,793 --> 00:18:17,556
That's not the Navy.

214
00:18:17,762 --> 00:18:19,889
I mean, he could
watch television at home.

215
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:24,467
We're paying you $ 150 a month.
If he's gonna be sitting around...

216
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:27,069
...watching TV all day,
we're taking him out of here.

217
00:18:27,271 --> 00:18:31,071
Go pay more at other daycare
if you don't like Navy TV.

218
00:18:32,944 --> 00:18:38,143
You late pay anyway.
You complain. I complain.

219
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:43,450
Can you at least put the dog upstairs
in your room or something?

220
00:18:43,654 --> 00:18:45,121
Bye.

221
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,402
I was waiting for
Witter Resource head Jay Twistle...

222
00:19:33,638 --> 00:19:39,133
...whose name sounded so delightful,
like he'd give me a job and a hug.

223
00:19:39,343 --> 00:19:43,336
I just had to show him I was good
with numbers and good with people.

224
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:45,106
- Morning, Mr. Twistle.
- Good morning.

225
00:19:45,316 --> 00:19:46,715
- Mr. Twistle, Chris Gardner.
- Hi.

226
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:49,716
I wanted to drop this off personally
and make your acquaintance.

227
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:53,322
I thought I'd catch you on the way in.
I'd love the opportunity to discuss...

228
00:19:53,524 --> 00:19:55,754
...what may seem like weaknesses
on my application.

229
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,758
We'll start with this, and we'll call you
if we wanna sit down.

230
00:19:58,963 --> 00:20:01,932
- Yes, sir. You have a great day.
- You too.

231
00:20:08,973 --> 00:20:10,565
Hey, yeah, how you doing?

232
00:20:10,775 --> 00:20:12,970
This is Chris Gardner calling
for Dr. Delsey.

233
00:20:13,177 --> 00:20:15,338
Yeah, I'm running a little late
for a sales call.

234
00:20:15,546 --> 00:20:19,038
I was wondering if...
Yeah, Osteo National.

235
00:20:19,283 --> 00:20:21,808
Right. We can still? Half an hour?

236
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:25,682
Yes. Beautiful. Beautiful.
Thank you, thank you.

237
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:38,361
Hey! Hey!

238
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,835
Hey!

239
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:42,403
This part of my life...

240
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:45,303
- Wait!
...this part here...

241
00:20:46,877 --> 00:20:48,504
...it's called "Running."

242
00:20:48,713 --> 00:20:50,647
Hey! Hey!

243
00:20:50,848 --> 00:20:52,406
Wait!

244
00:20:53,317 --> 00:20:56,150
Hey! Wait!

245
00:20:56,354 --> 00:20:58,720
That was my stolen machine.

246
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:00,982
Unless she was with
a guy who sold them too.

247
00:21:02,526 --> 00:21:03,754
Which was unlikely...

248
00:21:03,961 --> 00:21:06,623
...because I was the only one
selling them in the Bay Area.

249
00:21:06,831 --> 00:21:09,493
I spent our entire life savings
on these things.

250
00:21:11,902 --> 00:21:15,497
It was such
a revolutionary machine.

251
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:18,074
- Can you feel it, baby?
- Oh, yeah.

252
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:19,800
You got me doing all the work.

253
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:22,536
What I didn't know
is that doctors and hospitals...

254
00:21:22,747 --> 00:21:26,615
...would consider them
unnecessary luxuries.

255
00:21:29,253 --> 00:21:32,689
I even asked the landlord
to take a picture.

256
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:38,861
So if I lost one, it was like losing
a month's groceries.

257
00:21:41,766 --> 00:21:44,735
Hey, hey! Wait! Wait!

258
00:21:47,605 --> 00:21:50,301
Hey, get back here!

259
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:57,370
Hey, man, I...

260
00:21:59,216 --> 00:22:01,548
- Who's he?
- He's that guy...

261
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:15,931
- Did you forget?
- Forget what?

262
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:19,358
You're not supposed
to have any of those.

263
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,801
- Yeah, I know.
- You have two now.

264
00:22:33,184 --> 00:22:34,708
Hey.

265
00:22:37,655 --> 00:22:39,282
Hey, Mom.

266
00:22:44,628 --> 00:22:48,496
One, two, three!

267
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:52,695
- That's a basketball!
- Hey, hey. What do you mean?

268
00:22:52,903 --> 00:22:54,632
You don't know that
that's a basketball.

269
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:58,741
This could be an ant farm. This could
be a microscope or anything.

270
00:22:58,943 --> 00:23:01,411
- No, it's not.
- There, there.

271
00:23:01,846 --> 00:23:04,906
All right, come on.
Open him up. Open him up.

272
00:23:10,755 --> 00:23:15,192
- That paper's a little heavy, huh?
- Yeah, but I got it.

273
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,964
You should've seen me
out there today.

274
00:23:29,173 --> 00:23:31,698
Somebody stole a scanner.
I had to run the old girl down...

275
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:33,501
Whatever.

276
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:38,173
- What?
- Whatever, Chris.

277
00:23:38,749 --> 00:23:40,580
What the hell
you got attitude about?

278
00:23:40,785 --> 00:23:43,583
- "Whatever" what?
- Every day's got some damn story.

279
00:23:43,788 --> 00:23:45,153
Hey, Roy. Roy!

280
00:23:45,356 --> 00:23:47,654
Can you beat your little rug
when nobody's out here?

281
00:23:47,858 --> 00:23:49,291
There's dust and shit all over.

282
00:23:49,493 --> 00:23:51,893
- I'm trying to keep a clean house.
- Hey, wait a second.

283
00:23:52,096 --> 00:23:54,860
Look, Linda, relax.

284
00:23:55,065 --> 00:23:58,398
We're gonna come out of this.
Everything is gonna be fine, all right?

285
00:23:59,503 --> 00:24:03,405
You said that before,
when I got pregnant. "lt'll be fine."

286
00:24:03,607 --> 00:24:08,601
- So you don't trust me now?
- Whatever. I don't care.

287
00:24:23,794 --> 00:24:26,024
- Taxi!
- Mr. Twistle.

288
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,892
- Yeah, hi.
- Hi. Chris Gardner.

289
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:30,930
Yeah, hi. Listen.
What can I do for you?

290
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:34,195
I submitted an application for the
intern program about a month ago...

291
00:24:34,405 --> 00:24:36,635
...and I would just love
to sit with you briefly...

292
00:24:36,841 --> 00:24:38,809
Listen, I'm going
to Noe Valley, Chris.

293
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:42,308
- Take care of yourself.
- Mr. Twistle.

294
00:24:42,513 --> 00:24:44,879
Actually, I'm on my way
to Noe Valley also.

295
00:24:45,082 --> 00:24:46,811
How about we share a ride?

296
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:50,480
- All right, get in.
- All right.

297
00:24:56,594 --> 00:24:59,324
So when I was in the Navy,
I worked for a doctor...

298
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,363
...who loved to play golf,
hours every day...

299
00:25:02,566 --> 00:25:07,196
...and I would actually
perform medical procedures...

300
00:25:07,404 --> 00:25:08,962
...when he'd leave me in the office.

301
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:14,440
So I'm used to being in a position
where I have to make decisions and...

302
00:25:15,913 --> 00:25:18,746
Mr. Twistle, listen.
This is a very important...

303
00:25:18,949 --> 00:25:21,144
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
This thing's impossible.

304
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,347
- I can do it.
- No, you can't. No one can.

305
00:25:25,556 --> 00:25:28,218
- That's bullshit.
- No, I'm pretty sure I can do it.

306
00:25:28,692 --> 00:25:31,855
- No, you can't.
- Let me see it.

307
00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:33,657
Give it here.

308
00:25:36,634 --> 00:25:40,934
Oh, yeah. Oh, wow,
you really messed it up.

309
00:25:41,138 --> 00:25:42,662
Sorry.

310
00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:49,168
It looks like it works around a swivel,
so the center pieces never move.

311
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,474
So if it's yellow in the center,
that's the yellow side.

312
00:25:52,683 --> 00:25:55,174
If it's red in the center,
that's the red side.

313
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:59,015
- Okay.
- So... You can slow down.

314
00:25:59,223 --> 00:26:02,283
Listen, we can drive around all day.
I don't believe you can do this.

315
00:26:02,493 --> 00:26:04,188
- Yeah, I can.
- No, you can't.

316
00:26:04,395 --> 00:26:05,555
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

317
00:26:05,763 --> 00:26:07,697
I'm telling you, no one can.

318
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,864
See? That's all I ever do.

319
00:26:24,748 --> 00:26:27,046
You almost have this side.

320
00:26:27,651 --> 00:26:29,118
Holy cow.

321
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:43,130
- You almost had that one.
- I'm gonna get it.

322
00:26:50,674 --> 00:26:52,437
Look at that.

323
00:27:15,699 --> 00:27:16,927
You're almost there.

324
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:44,355
- 17.10.
- This is me.

325
00:27:46,497 --> 00:27:47,896
Good job.

326
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,828
- Goodbye.
- Yeah. I'll see you soon.

327
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:56,968
Where are you going, sir?

328
00:27:57,174 --> 00:28:00,166
Excuse me, sir.
Where are you going, please?

329
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,243
Two... A couple of blocks.

330
00:28:05,449 --> 00:28:08,850
- Just flip around.
- Okay.

331
00:28:50,761 --> 00:28:53,525
Hey! Stop it! Hey!

332
00:28:53,897 --> 00:28:55,455
- Where are you going? Come here!
- No!

333
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:58,499
- No, no, no!
- You asshole, give me my money!

334
00:28:58,702 --> 00:29:00,033
- Give me my money.
- Please stop.

335
00:29:00,237 --> 00:29:02,228
- Please, please, please!
- Son of a bitch.

336
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:04,999
Please! He should've paid you!

337
00:29:05,209 --> 00:29:06,733
- Come here!
- I'm sorry.

338
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,639
- I'm so sorry.
- I'll kick your ass!

339
00:29:09,113 --> 00:29:12,276
- I'm sorry!
- Idiot.

340
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:24,424
I'll get you!

341
00:29:24,628 --> 00:29:28,120
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!

342
00:29:43,514 --> 00:29:45,607
Hey!

343
00:29:45,816 --> 00:29:48,717
Stop it, you son of a bitch!

344
00:29:48,986 --> 00:29:51,079
Stop him!

345
00:29:54,491 --> 00:29:57,016
Stop him!

346
00:30:02,266 --> 00:30:03,961
The doors are closing.

347
00:30:04,168 --> 00:30:07,001
Please stand clear of the doors.

348
00:30:14,945 --> 00:30:18,073
No! No! No!

349
00:30:20,751 --> 00:30:22,548
No!

350
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:48,075
- Hello?
- Hey, yeah.

351
00:30:48,278 --> 00:30:49,973
Sorry I couldn't
make it home on time.

352
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:54,412
- Chris, I missed my shift.
- Yeah, I know. I'm sorry about that.

353
00:30:54,618 --> 00:30:57,917
Look, I'm on my way right now.
Are you all right with Christopher?

354
00:30:58,121 --> 00:31:00,487
I'm leaving. Chris, I'm leaving.

355
00:31:00,691 --> 00:31:02,682
- What?
- Did you hear what I said?

356
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,496
I have my things together,
and I'm taking our son...

357
00:31:07,698 --> 00:31:09,222
...and we're gonna leave now.

358
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,999
I'm gonna put the phone down.

359
00:31:11,201 --> 00:31:14,728
- Linda, wait a minute. Hold it, hold...
- I'm going to leave. We are leaving.

360
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:23,869
It was right then that I started
thinking about Thomas Jefferson...

361
00:31:25,182 --> 00:31:27,650
...the Declaration of Independence...

362
00:31:27,985 --> 00:31:33,946
...and the part about our right to life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

363
00:31:34,157 --> 00:31:35,988
And I remember thinking:

364
00:31:36,193 --> 00:31:40,562
How did he know
to put the "pursuit" part in there?

365
00:31:40,764 --> 00:31:45,463
That maybe happiness is something
that we can only pursue.

366
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:48,695
And maybe we can actually
never have it...

367
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,700
...no matter what.

368
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:52,603
How did he know that?

369
00:31:57,848 --> 00:32:00,646
Linda. Linda.

370
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:35,278
- Hello?
- Chris.

371
00:32:35,485 --> 00:32:38,113
- Who is this?
- Jay Twistle.

372
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:40,787
- Hey.
- Dean Witter.

373
00:32:40,991 --> 00:32:43,687
Yeah, of course. How are you?

374
00:32:43,894 --> 00:32:46,362
I'm fine. Listen, do you still
wanna come in and talk?

375
00:32:46,563 --> 00:32:47,825
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

376
00:32:48,031 --> 00:32:50,932
I'll tell you what. Come on by
day after tomorrow, in the morning.

377
00:32:51,134 --> 00:32:54,900
We're interviewing for the internships.
You got a pen and paper?

378
00:32:55,138 --> 00:32:56,662
Yes. Yes, I do.

379
00:32:59,643 --> 00:33:02,407
- Hold on one second.
- All right.

380
00:33:06,283 --> 00:33:08,410
Hello?

381
00:33:08,618 --> 00:33:10,950
- Chris?
- Go ahead. I have one.

382
00:33:11,154 --> 00:33:13,782
Write this number down so you can
call my secretary, Janice.

383
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:16,050
- She can give you all the specifics.
- Yep.

384
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:18,124
- Okay, 415.
- 415.

385
00:33:18,328 --> 00:33:20,023
- 864.
- 864.

386
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,255
- 0256.
- 0256.

387
00:33:22,466 --> 00:33:25,458
- Yeah, extension 4796.
- 4796.

388
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:29,935
- Right. Call her tomorrow.
- Yes, sir. 415-864-0256.

389
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,437
- Okay, buddy.
- All right, yes.

390
00:33:31,641 --> 00:33:33,802
- Thank you very much.
- We'll see you soon.

391
00:33:34,578 --> 00:33:37,741
864-0256.

392
00:33:37,948 --> 00:33:41,145
4796. Janice.

393
00:33:44,187 --> 00:33:46,018
- Chris.
- Hey.

394
00:33:46,223 --> 00:33:48,487
Did you? Have you seen
Linda and Christopher?

395
00:33:48,692 --> 00:33:50,592
- No. You catch the game last night?
- No, no.

396
00:33:50,794 --> 00:33:52,159
You didn't see that, 118, 1?

397
00:33:52,362 --> 00:33:54,557
Excuse me, did Linda
and Christopher come in here?

398
00:33:54,765 --> 00:33:58,428
- No, I haven't see them.
- 119-120. Double overtime.

399
00:33:58,635 --> 00:34:00,762
Moons hits a three-pointer
at 17 seconds left.

400
00:34:00,971 --> 00:34:02,563
Wayne, Wayne, Wayne.

401
00:34:02,773 --> 00:34:04,900
Can't talk to you
about numbers right now.

402
00:34:05,108 --> 00:34:07,736
- What's your problem with numbers?
- 864-2...

403
00:34:07,944 --> 00:34:09,878
- And you owe me money.
- Yeah.

404
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,843
You owe me $ 14.

405
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:13,914
I'm gonna get that to you.

406
00:34:14,785 --> 00:34:17,253
I need my money.
I need my money.

407
00:34:18,355 --> 00:34:20,448
Fourteen's a number.

408
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:50,114
Hey, don't you ever take my son
away from me again.

409
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,617
- You hear me?
- Leave me alone!

410
00:34:51,822 --> 00:34:53,653
Don't take my son away
from me again.

411
00:34:53,857 --> 00:34:55,620
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

412
00:34:55,826 --> 00:34:59,125
Don't you walk away from me when
I'm talking to you. Do you hear me?

413
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:00,853
- Do you wanna leave?
- Yeah.

414
00:35:01,064 --> 00:35:03,897
- You wanna leave?
- Yes, I want to leave!

415
00:35:05,135 --> 00:35:07,000
Get the hell out of here,
then, Linda.

416
00:35:07,204 --> 00:35:09,729
Get the hell out of here.
Christopher's staying with me.

417
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,238
You're the one that dragged
us down. You hear me?

418
00:35:12,442 --> 00:35:15,536
- You are so weak.
- No. I am not happy anymore.

419
00:35:15,745 --> 00:35:18,339
- I'm just not happy!
- Then go get happy, Linda!

420
00:35:18,548 --> 00:35:19,913
Just go get happy.

421
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,315
But Christopher's living with me.

422
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:24,316
- Stop!
- Did you hear what I said?

423
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:27,021
Christopher's living with me!

424
00:35:53,183 --> 00:35:56,118
Hey. Come on, let's go.

425
00:35:56,319 --> 00:35:58,651
- How you doing, Mrs. Chu?
- Hi.

426
00:36:02,325 --> 00:36:04,885
- Where's Mom?
- Look, just get your stuff.

427
00:36:05,095 --> 00:36:08,553
But she told me she was
coming to pick me up today.

428
00:36:08,765 --> 00:36:10,790
Yeah, I know.

429
00:36:11,935 --> 00:36:16,565
I talked to Mom earlier.
Everything's fine, okay?

430
00:36:22,012 --> 00:36:24,207
Where do I sleep tonight?

431
00:36:24,414 --> 00:36:26,541
Let me ask you something.
Are you happy?

432
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,412
- Yeah.
- All right. Because I'm happy.

433
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:33,077
And if you're happy and I'm happy,
then that's a good thing, right?

434
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,814
- Yeah.
- All right.

435
00:36:35,025 --> 00:36:37,050
You're sleeping with me.

436
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:41,924
You're staying at home,
where you belong, all right?

437
00:36:56,379 --> 00:36:58,040
Christopher.

438
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,432
Hey, listen. I need the rent.

439
00:37:18,635 --> 00:37:20,068
I can't wait anymore.

440
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:22,670
Yeah, I'm good for that, Charlie.
I'm gonna get it.

441
00:37:22,872 --> 00:37:25,898
Why don't you go two blocks over
at the Mission Inn motel?

442
00:37:26,109 --> 00:37:27,667
It's half what you pay here.

443
00:37:27,877 --> 00:37:31,278
Listen, Chris. I need you out
of here in the morning.

444
00:37:32,649 --> 00:37:34,810
The hell am I supposed
to be out of here tomorrow?

445
00:37:35,018 --> 00:37:36,212
I got painters coming in.

446
00:37:36,419 --> 00:37:38,717
- All right, look. I need more time.
- No.

447
00:37:38,922 --> 00:37:41,049
All right, I'll paint it myself.

448
00:37:41,258 --> 00:37:46,628
All right, but I just... I gotta have some
more time... I got my son up in here.

449
00:37:51,468 --> 00:37:56,303
All right. One week.
And you paint it.

450
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:49,818
Chris Gardner?

451
00:38:50,393 --> 00:38:53,123
Yeah. What happened?

452
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:57,198
- Payable to the City of San Francisco.
- Does it have to be the full amount?

453
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,892
You gotta pay each parking ticket,
otherwise, you're staying.

454
00:39:01,104 --> 00:39:02,571
This is all I got.

455
00:39:08,044 --> 00:39:10,740
You verify at 9:30
tomorrow morning.

456
00:39:11,281 --> 00:39:14,307
- What?
- You gotta stay until this thing clears.

457
00:39:16,486 --> 00:39:18,044
No.

458
00:39:18,254 --> 00:39:20,051
No, I can't spend the night here.

459
00:39:20,256 --> 00:39:22,850
- I have to pick up my son.
- You verify at 9:30 tomorrow.

460
00:39:23,059 --> 00:39:27,689
Sir, I have a job interview at Dean
Witter at 10:15 tomorrow morning.

461
00:39:27,897 --> 00:39:29,592
- I cannot stay...
- 9:30 tomorrow morning.

462
00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:32,131
What am I supposed to do
with my son?

463
00:39:32,335 --> 00:39:34,803
- Is there anyone else who can?
- I take care of him.

464
00:39:35,004 --> 00:39:38,030
Maybe we can go and have
Social Services pick him up.

465
00:39:42,078 --> 00:39:45,775
All right.
Can I have my phone call, please?

466
00:39:48,952 --> 00:39:51,216
- Hello.
- Hey.

467
00:39:51,421 --> 00:39:53,150
What do you want?

468
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:58,920
You gotta get Christopher
from daycare. I can't.

469
00:40:00,096 --> 00:40:03,759
Just keep him for the night and I'm...
And... Just one night.

470
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:06,026
What happened?

471
00:40:06,236 --> 00:40:09,694
I'll pick him up
from daycare tomorrow.

472
00:40:09,906 --> 00:40:11,669
I'm gonna go right...
You can just...

473
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:14,173
You can drop him off
and I'll pick him up.

474
00:40:14,511 --> 00:40:17,947
- No.
- Come on, Linda.

475
00:40:18,148 --> 00:40:22,414
- Why you doing that?
- No, I wanna take him to the park.

476
00:40:22,852 --> 00:40:26,948
To Golden Gate
after daycare tomorrow.

477
00:40:28,224 --> 00:40:30,351
- How is he?
- He's fine.

478
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,620
All right, just... All right,
take him to the park...

479
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:37,630
...and bring him back, all right?

480
00:40:37,834 --> 00:40:40,803
All right, just bring me my son back.

481
00:40:41,771 --> 00:40:43,671
Okay?

482
00:40:43,873 --> 00:40:45,397
Linda?

483
00:40:45,608 --> 00:40:47,508
I'll bring him back around 6.

484
00:40:49,379 --> 00:40:51,540
All right, all right.

485
00:40:51,748 --> 00:40:53,613
Thank you.

486
00:40:56,052 --> 00:40:57,542
Bye.

487
00:41:22,345 --> 00:41:24,074
I'm okay?

488
00:41:59,015 --> 00:42:01,142
Excuse me. Excuse me.

489
00:42:01,684 --> 00:42:03,151
Yes, I did.

490
00:42:11,794 --> 00:42:13,591
Mr. Gardner.

491
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,570
This way.

492
00:42:24,807 --> 00:42:26,832
It'll be right this way.

493
00:42:38,922 --> 00:42:40,355
What is the word on that one?

494
00:43:02,011 --> 00:43:03,876
Chris Gardner.

495
00:43:06,449 --> 00:43:08,110
Chris Gardner.

496
00:43:08,551 --> 00:43:10,542
How are you? Good morning.

497
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:15,022
Chris Gardner. Chris Gardner.
Good to see you again.

498
00:43:15,224 --> 00:43:17,192
Chris Gardner. Pleasure.

499
00:43:18,828 --> 00:43:20,921
I've been sitting there
for the last half-hour...

500
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:22,688
...trying to come up with a story...

501
00:43:22,899 --> 00:43:27,165
...that would explain my being here
dressed like this.

502
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:31,397
And I wanted to come up with a story
that would demonstrate qualities...

503
00:43:31,608 --> 00:43:36,443
...that I'm sure you all admire here,
like earnestness or diligence.

504
00:43:36,646 --> 00:43:41,345
Team-playing, something.
And I couldn't think of anything.

505
00:43:42,518 --> 00:43:44,281
So the truth is...

506
00:43:44,487 --> 00:43:47,115
...I was arrested
for failure to pay parking tickets.

507
00:43:47,323 --> 00:43:49,188
Parking tickets?

508
00:43:49,692 --> 00:43:53,253
And I ran all the way here from
the Polk Station, the police station.

509
00:43:53,463 --> 00:43:55,454
What were you doing
before you were arrested?

510
00:43:55,665 --> 00:43:58,691
I was painting my apartment.

511
00:43:58,901 --> 00:44:01,062
Is it dry now?

512
00:44:01,804 --> 00:44:02,998
I hope so.

513
00:44:03,206 --> 00:44:04,935
Jay says you're pretty determined.

514
00:44:05,141 --> 00:44:07,507
He's been waiting outside
the front of the building...

515
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:09,837
...with some 40-pound gizmo
for over a month.

516
00:44:10,046 --> 00:44:13,447
- He said you're smart.
- Well, I like to think so.

517
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:16,642
- And you want to learn this business?
- Yes, sir, I wanna learn.

518
00:44:16,853 --> 00:44:18,878
Have you already started learning
on your own?

519
00:44:19,088 --> 00:44:20,749
Absolutely.

520
00:44:21,491 --> 00:44:23,288
- Jay?
- Yes, sir.

521
00:44:23,493 --> 00:44:25,586
How many times
have you seen Chris?

522
00:44:25,795 --> 00:44:28,457
I don't know.
One too many, apparently.

523
00:44:29,065 --> 00:44:31,431
- Was he ever dressed like this?
- No.

524
00:44:31,634 --> 00:44:33,829
No. Jacket and tie.

525
00:44:35,738 --> 00:44:38,639
First in your class in school?

526
00:44:38,841 --> 00:44:40,672
- High school?
- Yes, sir.

527
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:44,102
- How many in the class?
- Twelve.

528
00:44:44,313 --> 00:44:46,042
It was a small town.

529
00:44:46,482 --> 00:44:49,849
- I'll say.
- But I was also first in my radar class...

530
00:44:50,053 --> 00:44:53,318
...in the Navy,
and that was a class of 20.

531
00:44:55,792 --> 00:44:57,623
Can I say something?

532
00:44:58,795 --> 00:45:00,490
I'm the type of person...

533
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:03,962
...if you ask me a question,
and I don't know the answer...

534
00:45:04,167 --> 00:45:06,431
...l'm gonna tell you
that I don't know.

535
00:45:06,636 --> 00:45:07,967
But I bet you what.

536
00:45:08,171 --> 00:45:13,165
I know how to find the answer,
and I will find the answer.

537
00:45:14,377 --> 00:45:16,106
Is that fair enough?

538
00:45:17,346 --> 00:45:18,540
Chris.

539
00:45:19,882 --> 00:45:23,613
What would you say
if a guy walked in for an interview...

540
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,811
...without a shirt on...

541
00:45:26,022 --> 00:45:28,957
...and I hired him?
What would you say?

542
00:45:33,196 --> 00:45:36,290
He must've had on
some really nice pants.

543
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:54,541
Chris, I don't know how you did it
dressed as a garbage man...

544
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:57,015
...but you pulled it off.
- Thank you, Mr. Twistle.

545
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,620
Hey, now you can call me Jay.
We'll talk to you soon.

546
00:46:00,223 --> 00:46:02,748
All right, so I'll let you know, Jay.

547
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:05,857
"You'll let me know, Jay"?
What do you mean?

548
00:46:06,062 --> 00:46:08,030
Yeah, I'll give you a call
tomorrow sometime...

549
00:46:08,231 --> 00:46:10,358
What are you talking?
You hounded me for this.

550
00:46:10,566 --> 00:46:13,330
- You stood here...
- Listen, there's no salary.

551
00:46:13,536 --> 00:46:14,901
- No.
- I was not aware of that.

552
00:46:15,104 --> 00:46:16,696
My circumstances
have changed some...

553
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,937
...and I need to be certain that I'll be...
- All right. Okay.

554
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,672
Tonight.

555
00:46:25,882 --> 00:46:29,374
I swear I will fill your spot. I promise.

556
00:46:29,585 --> 00:46:32,577
If you back out, you know what
I'll look like to the partners?

557
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:35,758
Yes, an ass... A-hole.

558
00:46:36,058 --> 00:46:39,459
Yeah, an ass A-hole, all the way.

559
00:46:42,331 --> 00:46:44,925
You are a piece of work.

560
00:46:45,968 --> 00:46:47,526
Tonight.

561
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:57,780
There was no salary.

562
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:01,143
Not even a reasonable promise
of a job.

563
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:12,454
One intern was hired at the end
of the program from a pool of 20.

564
00:47:12,795 --> 00:47:14,092
And if you weren't that guy...

565
00:47:14,297 --> 00:47:16,663
...you couldn't even apply
the six months' training...

566
00:47:16,866 --> 00:47:18,697
...to another brokerage.

567
00:47:21,237 --> 00:47:23,364
The only resource I would have
for six months...

568
00:47:23,573 --> 00:47:27,509
...would be my six scanners,
which I could still try to sell.

569
00:47:28,711 --> 00:47:32,169
If I sold them all,
maybe we might get by.

570
00:48:19,061 --> 00:48:22,292
- I got him. I got him.
- He's asleep.

571
00:48:22,498 --> 00:48:24,022
All right.

572
00:48:30,406 --> 00:48:32,306
Okay, baby.

573
00:48:44,854 --> 00:48:46,617
I got it.

574
00:48:51,594 --> 00:48:53,653
I'm going to New York.

575
00:49:23,092 --> 00:49:25,424
My sister's boyfriend...

576
00:49:25,995 --> 00:49:29,487
...opened a restaurant,
and they may have a job for me there.

577
00:49:30,266 --> 00:49:32,757
So I'm going to New York, Chris.

578
00:49:35,738 --> 00:49:37,638
Christopher's staying with me.

579
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:47,413
I'm his mom, you know?

580
00:49:47,616 --> 00:49:49,709
He should be with his mom.

581
00:49:49,919 --> 00:49:51,784
I should have him, right?

582
00:49:52,655 --> 00:49:55,021
You know
you can't take care of him.

583
00:50:02,932 --> 00:50:04,456
What are you gonna do for money?

584
00:50:06,702 --> 00:50:12,197
I had an interview
at Dean Witter for an internship...

585
00:50:12,408 --> 00:50:13,875
...and I got it.

586
00:50:14,076 --> 00:50:16,636
So I'm gonna stand out
in my program.

587
00:50:18,347 --> 00:50:20,440
Salesman to intern's backwards.

588
00:50:20,649 --> 00:50:22,583
No, it's not.

589
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,415
I gotta go.

590
00:50:59,989 --> 00:51:02,355
Tell him I love him, okay?

591
00:51:02,992 --> 00:51:04,584
And...

592
00:51:10,533 --> 00:51:12,865
I know you'll take care of him, Chris.

593
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:14,764
I know that.

594
00:51:56,378 --> 00:51:59,108
- Dean Witter.
- Yes, hi.

595
00:51:59,415 --> 00:52:03,146
Yes, I'd like to leave a message
for Mr. Jay Twistle.

596
00:52:03,352 --> 00:52:06,913
- Your name?
- Yeah, my name is Chris Gardner.

597
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:08,249
The message is:

598
00:52:08,457 --> 00:52:14,123
Thank you very much
for inviting me into the program.

599
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:20,200
I really appreciate it and I'd be
very pleased to accept your invitation.

600
00:52:20,402 --> 00:52:22,267
Is that all?

601
00:52:22,538 --> 00:52:24,096
Yes, that's it.

602
00:52:24,306 --> 00:52:26,069
- Okay.
- Thank you.

603
00:52:26,275 --> 00:52:27,833
Bye.

604
00:52:54,436 --> 00:52:55,733
- Be careful with that.
- What?

605
00:52:55,938 --> 00:52:58,702
Be care... Go ahead.

606
00:53:22,565 --> 00:53:25,500
- Are we there?
- Yep.

607
00:53:38,781 --> 00:53:41,341
- Hey, you know what today is?
- Yeah.

608
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:43,211
- What?
- Saturday.

609
00:53:43,419 --> 00:53:45,717
- You know what Saturday is, right?
- Yeah.

610
00:53:45,921 --> 00:53:48,355
- What?
- Basketball.

611
00:53:48,557 --> 00:53:51,458
- You wanna go play some basketball?
- Okay.

612
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:54,220
All right, then we're gonna go
sell a bone-density scanner.

613
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:58,696
- How about that? Wanna do that?
- No.

614
00:53:59,902 --> 00:54:02,302
Hey, Dad. I'm going pro.

615
00:54:04,006 --> 00:54:05,974
I'm going pro.

616
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:08,608
Okay.

617
00:54:08,811 --> 00:54:11,609
Yeah, I don't know, you know.

618
00:54:12,348 --> 00:54:14,578
You'll probably be about as good
as I was.

619
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:17,877
That's kind of the way it works,
you know. I was below average.

620
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:21,883
You know, so you'll probably
ultimately rank...

621
00:54:22,091 --> 00:54:24,719
...somewhere around there,
you know, so...

622
00:54:24,927 --> 00:54:27,794
...I really... You'll excel at
a lot of things, just not this.

623
00:54:27,997 --> 00:54:30,431
I don't want you shooting
this ball all day and night.

624
00:54:30,633 --> 00:54:32,157
- All right?
- All right.

625
00:54:32,368 --> 00:54:34,199
Okay.

626
00:54:35,337 --> 00:54:36,964
All right, go ahead.

627
00:55:00,796 --> 00:55:02,423
Hey.

628
00:55:05,601 --> 00:55:07,933
Don't ever let somebody tell you...

629
00:55:08,137 --> 00:55:10,697
...you can't do something.

630
00:55:11,407 --> 00:55:13,500
Not even me.

631
00:55:14,843 --> 00:55:18,040
- All right?
- All right.

632
00:55:18,714 --> 00:55:20,909
You got a dream...

633
00:55:21,116 --> 00:55:23,346
...you gotta protect it.

634
00:55:24,453 --> 00:55:26,114
People can't do something
themselves...

635
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:28,756
...they wanna tell you
you can't do it.

636
00:55:33,095 --> 00:55:36,895
If you want something,
go get it. Period.

637
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,498
Let's go.

638
00:55:48,677 --> 00:55:49,511
Dad, why did we move to a motel?

639
00:55:49,511 --> 00:55:52,139
Dad, why did we move to a motel?

640
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:54,816
I told you. Because I'm getting
a better job.

641
00:55:56,085 --> 00:55:59,111
- You gotta trust me, all right?
- I trust you.

642
00:55:59,321 --> 00:56:02,051
All right, here.
Come on, come on. Keep up.

643
00:56:03,292 --> 00:56:06,261
Dad, when's Mom coming back?

644
00:56:06,795 --> 00:56:08,990
Dad, when's Mom coming back?

645
00:56:09,198 --> 00:56:11,428
I don't know, Christopher.

646
00:56:11,767 --> 00:56:13,701
Dad, listen to this.

647
00:56:13,902 --> 00:56:17,360
One day, a man was drowning
in the water.

648
00:56:17,573 --> 00:56:20,041
And a boat came by and said,
"Do you need any help?"

649
00:56:20,242 --> 00:56:22,574
He said, "No, thank you.
God will save me."

650
00:56:22,778 --> 00:56:25,975
Then another boat came by.
Said, "Do you need any help?"

651
00:56:26,181 --> 00:56:28,547
And he said, "No, thank you.
God will save me."

652
00:56:28,751 --> 00:56:30,878
Then he drowned,
and he went to heaven.

653
00:56:31,086 --> 00:56:34,317
And he said, "God,
why didn't you save me?"

654
00:56:34,523 --> 00:56:38,015
And God said, "I sent you
two big boats, you dummy."

655
00:56:39,328 --> 00:56:40,761
Do you like it?

656
00:56:40,963 --> 00:56:43,693
Yeah, that's very funny, man.
Give me your hand.

657
00:56:49,705 --> 00:56:51,366
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Yes, sir.

658
00:56:51,573 --> 00:56:53,200
- You got the bill of sale here.
- Yes.

659
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:54,808
All the information you'll need.

660
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:56,637
Thank you very much
for your business.

661
00:56:56,845 --> 00:56:58,335
Thank you.

662
00:57:01,049 --> 00:57:03,779
One hundred, 200,
20, 40, 45, 46...

663
00:57:03,986 --> 00:57:05,613
...7, 8, 9, 10.

664
00:57:06,221 --> 00:57:07,313
Thank you.

665
00:57:09,658 --> 00:57:12,593
- Hey, you want one of those?
- No, it's okay.

666
00:57:12,795 --> 00:57:15,093
Come on, you can have one.
Which one?

667
00:57:15,998 --> 00:57:19,525
- You like that one? How much?
- Twenty-five cents.

668
00:57:33,749 --> 00:57:37,446
This part of my life
is called "Internship."

669
00:57:37,653 --> 00:57:41,020
The 1200 building is
Medley Industrial and Sanko Oil.

670
00:57:41,223 --> 00:57:43,487
The building across the street
is Lee-Ray Shipping.

671
00:57:43,692 --> 00:57:45,592
In a couple weeks,
you'll get call sheets...

672
00:57:45,794 --> 00:57:47,625
...with the phone numbers
of employees...

673
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:50,958
...from every Fortune 500 company
in the financial district.

674
00:57:51,266 --> 00:57:53,962
You will be pooling
from 60 Fortune companies.

675
00:57:54,169 --> 00:57:56,933
You will mainly be cold-calling
potential clients.

676
00:57:57,139 --> 00:58:00,131
But if you have to have lunch
with them, have breakfast with them...

677
00:58:00,342 --> 00:58:03,607
...even baby-sit for them, do whatever
it takes to familiarize them...

678
00:58:03,812 --> 00:58:06,747
...with our packages. We need you
to match their needs and goals...

679
00:58:06,949 --> 00:58:11,886
...to one of our many financial plans.
In essence, you reel them in...

680
00:58:12,087 --> 00:58:14,180
...we'll cook the fish.

681
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:17,015
Some of you are here
because you know somebody.

682
00:58:17,226 --> 00:58:19,626
Some of you are here because
you think you're somebody.

683
00:58:19,895 --> 00:58:22,386
There's one guy in here
who's gonna be somebody.

684
00:58:22,598 --> 00:58:24,793
That person's gonna be the guy...

685
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,264
...who can turn this into this.

686
00:58:27,469 --> 00:58:30,529
Eight hundred thousand
in commission dollars.

687
00:58:31,073 --> 00:58:32,904
You, you, help me hand these out.

688
00:58:33,742 --> 00:58:36,802
This is going to be your bible.

689
00:58:37,012 --> 00:58:38,343
You'll eat with it.

690
00:58:38,547 --> 00:58:40,242
- You'll drink with it.
- It was simple.

691
00:58:40,449 --> 00:58:43,418
X number of calls
equals X number of prospects.

692
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:46,588
X number of prospects
equals X number of customers.

693
00:58:46,855 --> 00:58:49,949
X number of customers
equals X number of dollars...

694
00:58:50,158 --> 00:58:52,319
...in the company's pocket.
- Your board exam.

695
00:58:52,528 --> 00:58:58,398
Last year, we had an intern score
a 96.4 percent on the written exam.

696
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,967
He wasn't chosen.
It's not a simple passlfail.

697
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:05,571
It's an evaluation tool we use
to separate applicants.

698
00:59:05,774 --> 00:59:08,140
Be safe, score a hundred.

699
00:59:09,111 --> 00:59:12,274
Okay, let's take a break.
Be back in 10.

700
00:59:21,557 --> 00:59:24,492
- Hey, Mr. Frohm. Chris.
- Hi.

701
00:59:24,693 --> 00:59:26,888
- Chris, how are you?
- I'm good. How you doing?

702
00:59:27,095 --> 00:59:31,191
- Fine, thank you for asking.
- First day in there. It was exciting.

703
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,493
You're not quitting on us yet,
are you?

704
00:59:33,702 --> 00:59:35,533
No, sir. Ten-minute break.

705
00:59:35,737 --> 00:59:38,535
Pop out, get a quick bite and then
back in there for board prep.

706
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:40,435
Oh, man, I remember mine.

707
00:59:40,642 --> 00:59:43,167
And ours were only an hour,
not three like yours.

708
00:59:43,378 --> 00:59:45,778
We didn't do world markets,
didn't bother with taxes...

709
00:59:45,981 --> 00:59:49,382
...and it was still a pain in the ass.
Funny what you remember.

710
00:59:49,585 --> 00:59:51,746
There was a beautiful girl
in that class.

711
00:59:51,954 --> 00:59:54,320
I can't remember her name,
but her face was so...

712
00:59:54,523 --> 00:59:56,855
I've seen an old friend of mine.
Do you mind?

713
00:59:57,059 --> 00:59:59,857
- No, go ahead.
- Good talking to you, sir.

714
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:33,294
Hey, asshole.
Are you all right, asshole?

715
01:00:33,595 --> 01:00:36,462
Are you okay?
What were you thinking?

716
01:00:36,665 --> 01:00:38,860
What are you doing?
I could've killed you.

717
01:00:39,067 --> 01:00:41,331
I'm trying to cross the street.

718
01:00:41,536 --> 01:00:44,994
- Well, you're all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

719
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:46,898
- Where's my shoe?
- What?

720
01:00:47,109 --> 01:00:50,909
- You knocked off my shoe!
- I don't know where your shoe is.

721
01:00:52,347 --> 01:00:55,248
- Where's my damn shoe?
- I don't know.

722
01:01:01,056 --> 01:01:02,523
Hey.

723
01:01:03,425 --> 01:01:06,690
- Did you see it? I lost my shoe.
- No, I'm sorry.

724
01:01:06,895 --> 01:01:10,262
Hey. Hey, where are you going?

725
01:01:10,465 --> 01:01:13,366
- We should wait for the police.
- I gotta go to work.

726
01:01:14,069 --> 01:01:17,800
Hey, you just got hit by a car.
Go to the hospital.

727
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:21,667
I'm in a competitive internship
at Dean Witter.

728
01:01:32,254 --> 01:01:33,915
Hey, man, you're missing a shoe.

729
01:01:34,122 --> 01:01:38,183
Oh, yeah, thanks. Thank you.

730
01:01:44,032 --> 01:01:45,431
Dad.

731
01:01:45,967 --> 01:01:48,959
- You don't have a shoe.
- Yeah, I know.

732
01:01:49,171 --> 01:01:52,231
- Wanna know what happened?
- Yeah.

733
01:01:52,974 --> 01:01:54,464
I got hit by a car.

734
01:01:54,676 --> 01:01:57,338
- You got hit by a car?
- Yep.

735
01:01:57,546 --> 01:02:01,175
- Where?
- Just right by the office.

736
01:02:01,383 --> 01:02:04,443
- No, where in your body?
- Like, the back of my legs.

737
01:02:04,653 --> 01:02:06,484
- Hey, goodbye, Mrs. Chu.
- Goodbye.

738
01:02:06,688 --> 01:02:09,851
- Where you on the street?
- Yeah, I was running in the street.

739
01:02:10,058 --> 01:02:12,959
Don't do that. You can get hurt.

740
01:02:13,295 --> 01:02:15,160
Yeah, thanks.

741
01:02:15,363 --> 01:02:17,092
I'll remember that next time.

742
01:02:19,401 --> 01:02:20,800
And here I was again.

743
01:02:21,002 --> 01:02:23,596
- Show up early.
- While qualified persons...

744
01:02:23,872 --> 01:02:27,740
...qualified persons are interested in
investing and have money to invest.

745
01:02:27,943 --> 01:02:29,843
- Now, Chris.
- Yes, sir.

746
01:02:30,045 --> 01:02:32,070
Would you get me
some coffee, please?

747
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:36,182
Favors for Frakesh,
our office manager. All day.

748
01:02:36,384 --> 01:02:38,944
My name is Chris Gardner
calling for Mr. Michael Anderson.

749
01:02:39,154 --> 01:02:41,588
Yes, sir, we're having a lunch
actually this Thursday.

750
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:44,691
Okay, next time.
All right, I'm gonna hold you to that.

751
01:02:44,893 --> 01:02:46,224
Okay, yes, thank you.

752
01:02:46,428 --> 01:02:47,793
Who wants to get me a doughnut?

753
01:02:47,996 --> 01:02:51,727
- Chris?
- Yes, sir.

754
01:02:53,101 --> 01:02:56,264
Feeling underrated
and unappreciated.

755
01:02:56,571 --> 01:02:58,095
Hello, Mr. Ronald Fryer.

756
01:02:58,306 --> 01:03:00,604
Good morning to you, sir.
My name is Chris Gardner.

757
01:03:00,809 --> 01:03:02,174
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

758
01:03:02,377 --> 01:03:05,574
Yes, I have some very, very valuable
information on what's called a tax...

759
01:03:05,781 --> 01:03:08,045
Okay, thank you, sir.

760
01:03:09,151 --> 01:03:13,850
Then catch the bus by 4 to the place
where they can't spell "happiness."

761
01:03:14,055 --> 01:03:15,818
Then the cross-town.

762
01:03:16,424 --> 01:03:18,187
The 22 home.

763
01:03:19,461 --> 01:03:22,089
- Hey, Chris!
- Hey. Hi, Ralph.

764
01:03:22,297 --> 01:03:25,198
- I'm waiting.
- All right, I got that for you, Ralph.

765
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,459
I'm gonna get that for you.

766
01:03:35,644 --> 01:03:39,080
Whoever brought in the most money
after six months was usually hired.

767
01:03:39,281 --> 01:03:41,374
Hello, Chris Gardner calling
for Mr. Walter Hobb.

768
01:03:41,583 --> 01:03:44,643
We were all working our way
up call sheets to sign clients.

769
01:03:44,853 --> 01:03:47,151
- From the bottom to the top.
- Yes, sir.

770
01:03:47,355 --> 01:03:50,051
- From the doorman to the CEO.
- Okay.

771
01:03:50,826 --> 01:03:53,454
They'd stay till 7,
but I had Christopher.

772
01:03:53,662 --> 01:03:56,688
I had to do in six hours
what they do in nine.

773
01:03:56,898 --> 01:04:00,026
Good afternoon, my name is Chris
Gardner. I'm calling from Dean Witter.

774
01:04:00,235 --> 01:04:01,827
In order not to waste any time...

775
01:04:02,037 --> 01:04:04,232
...I wasn't hanging up the phone
in between calls.

776
01:04:04,439 --> 01:04:06,498
Okay, thank you very much.

777
01:04:08,109 --> 01:04:10,270
I realized that
by not hanging up the phone...

778
01:04:10,478 --> 01:04:12,446
...I gained another eight minutes
a day.

779
01:04:12,647 --> 01:04:14,877
Why, good morning to you,
my name is Chris Gardner.

780
01:04:15,083 --> 01:04:17,608
- I'm calling from Dean Witter.
- I wasn't drinking water...

781
01:04:17,819 --> 01:04:19,844
...so I didn't' waste any time
in the bathroom.

782
01:04:20,055 --> 01:04:22,250
Yes, I'd love to have
the opportunity...

783
01:04:22,457 --> 01:04:25,517
Okay, no problem at all, sir.
Thank you very much.

784
01:04:25,727 --> 01:04:27,058
But even doing all this...

785
01:04:27,262 --> 01:04:31,358
...after two months, I still didn't have
time to work my way up a sheet.

786
01:04:44,579 --> 01:04:47,104
We're feeling really confident
about that one as well.

787
01:04:47,315 --> 01:04:48,509
Walter Ribbon's office.

788
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:51,913
Yes, hello, my name is Chris Gardner.
I'm calling for Mr. Walter Ribbon.

789
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,280
- Concerning?
- Yes, ma'am.

790
01:04:53,488 --> 01:04:54,819
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

791
01:04:55,023 --> 01:04:56,718
Just a moment.

792
01:04:58,627 --> 01:05:00,356
- Hello?
- Mr. Ribbon.

793
01:05:00,562 --> 01:05:03,531
Hello, sir. My name's Chris Gardner.
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

794
01:05:03,732 --> 01:05:05,461
- Yeah, Chris.
- Yes, Mr. Ribbon...

795
01:05:05,667 --> 01:05:09,068
...I would love to have the opportunity
to discuss some of our products.

796
01:05:09,271 --> 01:05:11,705
I'm certain that I could
be of some assistance to you.

797
01:05:11,907 --> 01:05:13,738
Can you be here in 20 minutes?

798
01:05:15,043 --> 01:05:17,978
- Twenty minutes. Absolutely.
- Just had someone cancel.

799
01:05:18,179 --> 01:05:20,272
I can give you a few minutes
before the 49ers.

800
01:05:20,482 --> 01:05:23,610
- Monday Night Football, buddy.
- Yes, sir. Thank you very much.

801
01:05:23,818 --> 01:05:26,116
- See you soon.
- Bye-bye.

802
01:05:28,757 --> 01:05:30,850
Excuse me. Thank you.

803
01:05:31,059 --> 01:05:32,617
- Chris, what's up?
- Hey, Mr. Frakesh.

804
01:05:32,827 --> 01:05:34,124
Hey, do you have five minutes?

805
01:05:34,329 --> 01:05:36,024
I got a green light
from Walter Ribbon...

806
01:05:36,231 --> 01:05:39,291
I'm supposed to present commodities
to Bromer. Could you move my car?

807
01:05:39,501 --> 01:05:42,766
That'd really help me out. It's on
Samson, half block, silver Caprice.

808
01:05:42,971 --> 01:05:46,168
Just move it to the other side. They're
street sweeping. There's spaces.

809
01:05:46,374 --> 01:05:48,934
Hang on to these.
I have backups in my desk.

810
01:05:49,144 --> 01:05:50,634
And you have to jimmy that.

811
01:05:50,845 --> 01:05:52,836
- Jimmy what?
- You have to jimmy the key.

812
01:05:53,048 --> 01:05:57,712
And the other doors don't unlock.
You have to jimmy it.

813
01:06:13,902 --> 01:06:15,631
Come on, I'm jimmying it.

814
01:06:18,873 --> 01:06:20,306
Oh, no!

815
01:06:21,643 --> 01:06:23,076
Come on.

816
01:06:36,124 --> 01:06:38,149
- Here's the file, Mr. Ribbon.
- Thank you.

817
01:06:43,098 --> 01:06:45,862
- Thanks a lot.
- Oh, yeah, thanks. Great idea.

818
01:06:50,171 --> 01:06:53,140
No, no, no!

819
01:07:03,251 --> 01:07:06,015
Rachel, get Ristuccia on the phone
for me, please.

820
01:07:54,502 --> 01:07:55,662
- Hi.
- Hi.

821
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:58,464
I'm Chris Gardner. I have
an appointment with Mr. Ribbon.

822
01:07:58,673 --> 01:08:00,072
Oh, you just missed him.

823
01:08:02,677 --> 01:08:04,201
Thank you.

824
01:08:28,303 --> 01:08:32,205
- What's that?
- Just filling out a check...

825
01:08:32,407 --> 01:08:34,898
...paying some bills...

826
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:37,135
...and a parking ticket.

827
01:08:39,013 --> 01:08:41,072
We don't have a car anymore.

828
01:08:41,282 --> 01:08:43,512
Yep, I know.

829
01:08:47,021 --> 01:08:50,081
I'm gonna need to take you
with me this weekend.

830
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:52,555
A couple of doctors' offices.

831
01:08:52,994 --> 01:08:56,862
- On sales calls, okay?
- Okay.

832
01:08:59,767 --> 01:09:03,760
Then, possibly,
we'll go to the football game.

833
01:09:03,972 --> 01:09:06,805
- Really?
- Possibly.

834
01:09:07,242 --> 01:09:09,676
- All right?
- All right.

835
01:09:09,878 --> 01:09:11,971
Come on, finish up.

836
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:15,449
- Are you sure?
- Possibly.

837
01:09:16,651 --> 01:09:18,243
Really?

838
01:09:48,183 --> 01:09:52,711
- Are you bringing it to the game?
- Yeah, I don't wanna leave it.

839
01:09:52,921 --> 01:09:55,890
And maybe
we're going to the game.

840
01:09:57,392 --> 01:10:01,351
- Where are we going now?
- To see someone about my job.

841
01:10:01,729 --> 01:10:03,424
I don't understand.

842
01:10:03,631 --> 01:10:06,828
- You don't understand what?
- Are we going to the game?

843
01:10:07,035 --> 01:10:09,560
I said possibly
we're going to the game.

844
01:10:09,771 --> 01:10:12,137
- You know what "possibly" means?
- Like probably.

845
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:14,968
No, "probably" means there's
a good chance that we're going.

846
01:10:15,176 --> 01:10:17,906
"Possibly" means we might,
we might not.

847
01:10:18,112 --> 01:10:21,172
- What does "probably" mean?
- It means we have a good chance.

848
01:10:21,382 --> 01:10:22,747
And what does "possibly" mean?

849
01:10:22,951 --> 01:10:25,419
- I know what it means.
- What does it mean?

850
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:28,180
It means that we're not going
to the game.

851
01:10:29,857 --> 01:10:33,122
- How did you get so smart?
- Because you're smart.

852
01:10:38,199 --> 01:10:40,963
- Are we there?
- Yeah.

853
01:10:46,474 --> 01:10:48,032
- Mr. Ribbon.
- Yes?

854
01:10:48,243 --> 01:10:51,144
How are you, sir?
Chris Gardner. Dean Witter.

855
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:54,113
- Oh, hi. Hi.
- This is my son, Christopher.

856
01:10:54,315 --> 01:10:55,839
- Hi.
- Hey, Christopher.

857
01:10:56,050 --> 01:10:58,450
- What are you doing up here?
- I came to apologize...

858
01:10:58,653 --> 01:11:01,315
...for missing our appointment.
- You didn't need to come up.

859
01:11:01,522 --> 01:11:04,116
We were in the neighborhood
visiting a very close friend...

860
01:11:04,325 --> 01:11:07,852
...and I wanted to take this opportunity
to say thank you for your time.

861
01:11:08,062 --> 01:11:10,895
- I know you probably waited for me.
- Little bit.

862
01:11:11,099 --> 01:11:13,624
I want you to know
that I do not take that for granted.

863
01:11:13,835 --> 01:11:15,894
Oh, come on. What's that?

864
01:11:16,104 --> 01:11:19,562
Oh, it's an Osteo National
bone-density scanner.

865
01:11:20,408 --> 01:11:23,309
A company I bought into
prior to going to work at Witter.

866
01:11:23,544 --> 01:11:26,172
- I have a meeting after the game.
- You're going to the game?

867
01:11:26,381 --> 01:11:28,144
- Yeah.
- Possibly.

868
01:11:29,183 --> 01:11:30,548
- Possibly.
- We're going too.

869
01:11:30,752 --> 01:11:32,413
I'm taking my son, Tim.
My 12-year-old.

870
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:33,746
We were just leaving. Tim!

871
01:11:34,022 --> 01:11:35,956
Listen, we'll get out of your way.

872
01:11:36,157 --> 01:11:38,887
Again, thank you very much,
and I'm sorry about the other day.

873
01:11:39,093 --> 01:11:41,152
And I hope that
we can reschedule for later.

874
01:11:41,362 --> 01:11:42,886
- You got it.
- Thank you very much.

875
01:11:43,097 --> 01:11:44,758
You take care. Here, come on.

876
01:11:44,966 --> 01:11:46,297
- Say bye-bye, Chris.
- Bye.

877
01:11:46,501 --> 01:11:48,128
Bye, Christopher.

878
01:11:48,336 --> 01:11:49,860
Hey, you guys wanna
come with us?

879
01:11:50,071 --> 01:11:53,006
- What? To Candlestick?
- We're going now. Come with us.

880
01:11:53,207 --> 01:11:56,370
- Where are your seats?
- We've... We're upper deck.

881
01:11:56,577 --> 01:11:57,805
We got a box. Come on.

882
01:11:58,012 --> 01:12:00,173
- You wanna sit in the box?
- No.

883
01:12:01,349 --> 01:12:05,308
It's not actually a box.
It's, you know, a private section.

884
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,988
It's more comfortable.
You wanna go?

885
01:12:08,656 --> 01:12:12,387
- Okay.
- Okay, kids in the back.

886
01:12:12,994 --> 01:12:15,224
Hey, why don't you just put that
in your car?

887
01:12:17,899 --> 01:12:20,868
- Yeah, okay. Sure, sure.
- We don't have a car.

888
01:12:21,769 --> 01:12:23,964
- Oh, my...
- What happened?

889
01:12:24,172 --> 01:12:25,537
I think I got stung by a bee.

890
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:28,675
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah. Goodness. I'm fine.

891
01:12:28,876 --> 01:12:31,470
- You're not allergic or anything?
- No, no, no.

892
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:35,012
- Where'd he get you?
- Just right at the back of my head.

893
01:12:35,216 --> 01:12:37,650
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, Christopher.

894
01:12:37,852 --> 01:12:39,979
- Does it hurt?
- Christopher, I'm fine.

895
01:12:40,188 --> 01:12:44,056
- Let me see.
- Christopher, sit back. Sit back.

896
01:12:44,258 --> 01:12:46,624
Thomas Jefferson mentions
happiness a couple times...

897
01:12:46,828 --> 01:12:49,626
...in the Declaration
of Independence.

898
01:12:50,064 --> 01:12:52,624
May seem like a strange word
to be in that document...

899
01:12:52,834 --> 01:12:57,771
...but he was sort of...
He was an artist.

900
01:12:58,005 --> 01:13:02,567
He called the English
"the disturbers of our harmony."

901
01:13:02,877 --> 01:13:04,640
And I remember standing there
that day...

902
01:13:04,846 --> 01:13:07,144
...thinking about
the disturbers of mine.

903
01:13:07,348 --> 01:13:11,614
Questions I had:
Whether all this was good.

904
01:13:11,986 --> 01:13:13,749
Whether I'd make it.

905
01:13:16,758 --> 01:13:19,750
And Walter Ribbon
and his Pacific Bell pension money...

906
01:13:19,961 --> 01:13:21,326
...which was millions.

907
01:13:21,529 --> 01:13:23,156
Yeah!

908
01:13:23,598 --> 01:13:26,533
It was a way to another place.

909
01:13:27,268 --> 01:13:29,395
Wow, this is...

910
01:13:29,771 --> 01:13:31,739
This is the way
to watch a football game here.

911
01:13:31,939 --> 01:13:35,033
- Thank you very much for this, really.
- Hey, it's my pleasure, Chris.

912
01:13:35,243 --> 01:13:38,508
And, Mr. Ribbon, I also wanna thank
you for giving me the opportunity...

913
01:13:38,713 --> 01:13:41,580
...to discuss the asset management
capabilities of Dean Witter...

914
01:13:41,883 --> 01:13:44,044
...which we believe
to be far superior...

915
01:13:44,252 --> 01:13:46,846
...to anything you got going
over at Morgan Stanley.

916
01:13:47,054 --> 01:13:48,885
Really, I think you're gonna
be blown away.

917
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:54,123
Point blank, Dean Witter needs to be
managing your retirement portfolio.

918
01:13:54,328 --> 01:13:56,888
You know, I didn't have any notion
that you were new there.

919
01:13:57,098 --> 01:14:00,556
I like you, but there's not a chance
I'm gonna let you direct our fund.

920
01:14:00,768 --> 01:14:02,861
That's just not gonna happen
anytime soon, buddy.

921
01:14:03,070 --> 01:14:06,198
So, you know, come on, relax.
Let's play the game. Go, go, go!

922
01:14:07,141 --> 01:14:08,438
Yes!

923
01:14:11,446 --> 01:14:13,505
Yes! Yeah!

924
01:14:18,186 --> 01:14:19,244
- Here you go.
- All right.

925
01:14:19,454 --> 01:14:21,217
I've had a few ideas
already, absolutely.

926
01:14:21,422 --> 01:14:23,982
- Chris, I'll talk to you later.
- I'm gonna give you a call.

927
01:14:24,192 --> 01:14:25,887
Nice to meet you, Chris.
Give me a call.

928
01:14:26,093 --> 01:14:27,685
Yes, absolutely. Thank you.

929
01:14:34,502 --> 01:14:37,266
- Bye.
- Bye, Christopher.

930
01:15:06,767 --> 01:15:11,295
After four months, we had sold
all our scanners.

931
01:15:12,573 --> 01:15:13,972
It seemed we were making it.

932
01:15:14,876 --> 01:15:16,138
What's the...

933
01:15:16,511 --> 01:15:19,002
...fastest animal in the world?
- Jackrabbit.

934
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:24,651
It seemed we were doing good.

935
01:15:24,852 --> 01:15:26,615
Till one day...

936
01:15:26,854 --> 01:15:28,549
...that day...

937
01:15:29,123 --> 01:15:31,057
...that letter brought me
back to earth.

938
01:15:38,432 --> 01:15:41,026
This part of my life is called
"Paying Taxes."

939
01:15:43,070 --> 01:15:44,401
If you didn't pay them...

940
01:15:44,605 --> 01:15:47,540
...the government could stick
their hands into your bank account...

941
01:15:48,209 --> 01:15:49,437
...and take your money.

942
01:15:49,644 --> 01:15:50,611
Dad.

943
01:15:50,811 --> 01:15:52,802
No warning. Nothing.

944
01:15:53,014 --> 01:15:56,142
It can't be too late.
That's my money.

945
01:15:56,350 --> 01:15:59,478
How is somebody just gonna
just take my money?

946
01:15:59,787 --> 01:16:01,084
I was... I was...

947
01:16:01,289 --> 01:16:04,622
Listen, I...
That's all the money that I have.

948
01:16:04,825 --> 01:16:09,125
You cannot go into my bank acc...
No...

949
01:16:09,330 --> 01:16:11,696
It was the 25th of September.

950
01:16:11,899 --> 01:16:13,594
I remember that day.

951
01:16:13,801 --> 01:16:15,894
Because that's the day
that I found out...

952
01:16:16,103 --> 01:16:21,234
...there was only 21 dollars
and 33 cents left in my bank account.

953
01:16:21,442 --> 01:16:23,137
I was broke.

954
01:16:33,487 --> 01:16:35,819
- Dressed yet?
- No.

955
01:16:39,694 --> 01:16:43,027
Chris! Chris!
Don't jerk me around, okay, Chris?

956
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:45,994
I'm not jerking you around, Ralph,
all right? I'm gonna get it.

957
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:49,761
- I need that money now, not later.
- When I get it, you get it, Ralph.

958
01:16:49,971 --> 01:16:51,871
Now!

959
01:16:55,509 --> 01:16:57,602
Hey, what's happening, man?

960
01:16:57,845 --> 01:17:00,712
Wayne, I need to get
that $ 14 from you.

961
01:17:02,383 --> 01:17:04,248
I thought I didn't owe you that now.

962
01:17:04,452 --> 01:17:07,512
- What? Why?
- Why what?

963
01:17:07,722 --> 01:17:10,088
Why would you think
you don't owe me my money?

964
01:17:10,291 --> 01:17:12,259
I helped you move.

965
01:17:14,495 --> 01:17:17,396
You drove me two blocks, Wayne.

966
01:17:17,598 --> 01:17:19,361
That's 200 yards.

967
01:17:19,567 --> 01:17:21,501
It's been four months, Wayne.

968
01:17:21,702 --> 01:17:25,297
I need my money. I need my money.
I need my money right now.

969
01:17:25,506 --> 01:17:27,838
- I don't have it, man. I'm sorry.
- Go get my money.

970
01:17:28,042 --> 01:17:30,272
- Wayne, get my mo...
- I really don't, man. It's $ 14.

971
01:17:30,478 --> 01:17:32,173
It's my $ 14!
Go get my money!

972
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:34,940
- All of this for $ 14.
- Get my money, Wayne.

973
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:55,461
Dad, look at me!

974
01:17:55,903 --> 01:17:57,632
Dad.

975
01:17:58,639 --> 01:18:02,166
- Should I go?
- Sure, man. Why not?

976
01:18:18,225 --> 01:18:19,283
- Stay here.
- Dad, look.

977
01:18:19,493 --> 01:18:21,085
- No, no. Stay right here.
- Dad.

978
01:18:21,295 --> 01:18:24,059
Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear me?

979
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:32,662
- Dad, where you going?
- Hey, what did I say?

980
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:37,337
Dad!

981
01:18:37,545 --> 01:18:40,946
Dad, wait! Dad!

982
01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:51,149
- Dad.
- I gotta...

983
01:18:51,358 --> 01:18:54,725
I gotta get back to the '60s, man.
That's what I wanna do.

984
01:18:54,929 --> 01:18:59,229
When I was younger. I wanna see
Jimi Hendrix do that guitar on fire.

985
01:19:02,303 --> 01:19:04,999
Bring back my time machine!

986
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:08,001
Bring my time machine back!

987
01:19:16,884 --> 01:19:20,479
- Dad, where are we going?
- Just be quiet.

988
01:19:21,088 --> 01:19:23,818
Go get your things. Go.

989
01:19:47,014 --> 01:19:48,709
- Chris?
- Yes.

990
01:19:48,916 --> 01:19:52,818
Dr. Telm can't get back to meet you.
I'm sorry.

991
01:20:03,998 --> 01:20:06,466
Where are we going now?

992
01:20:07,234 --> 01:20:10,499
Gotta... We gotta
see somebody else.

993
01:20:12,606 --> 01:20:14,733
I'm tired.

994
01:20:16,744 --> 01:20:18,371
I know.

995
01:20:25,753 --> 01:20:29,849
Doesn't seem to be functioning
right now.

996
01:20:30,291 --> 01:20:32,589
- I have to go now, Chris.
- No, no, no.

997
01:20:32,793 --> 01:20:36,661
Just give me a second. I'm sure
I'm gonna be able to figure it out.

998
01:20:38,465 --> 01:20:40,763
Chris. Chris, just come back
when it's working.

999
01:20:40,968 --> 01:20:43,801
- No, no. I have to fix it now.
- No.

1000
01:20:44,004 --> 01:20:49,237
Look, I'll still be putting money
in the office, then, all right?

1001
01:20:49,443 --> 01:20:51,570
I really have to go, Chris.

1002
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:54,475
Thank you. Thank you.

1003
01:20:54,682 --> 01:20:56,547
Thank you for your time.
I appreciate it.

1004
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:58,445
I'll see you soon.

1005
01:21:50,437 --> 01:21:52,871
Why are our things here?

1006
01:21:53,874 --> 01:21:55,501
Dad.

1007
01:22:38,018 --> 01:22:40,748
- Let's go. Come on.
- Where?

1008
01:22:42,356 --> 01:22:44,688
- Just out of here.
- Why?

1009
01:22:44,892 --> 01:22:47,884
- We can't stay here tonight.
- Yes, we can. Open the door!

1010
01:22:48,095 --> 01:22:51,064
- Did you hear what I said? Let's go.
- Open the door!

1011
01:22:52,766 --> 01:22:56,634
Hey, did you hear what I said?
Stop it.

1012
01:22:56,837 --> 01:22:58,327
Stop it.

1013
01:23:02,543 --> 01:23:04,033
Come on.

1014
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,610
Come on.

1015
01:23:31,605 --> 01:23:33,266
Wayne!

1016
01:23:34,341 --> 01:23:36,241
Wayne!

1017
01:23:43,417 --> 01:23:45,749
Wayne!

1018
01:24:01,268 --> 01:24:04,999
Get up. Stand up. Come on.

1019
01:24:20,854 --> 01:24:22,879
Where are we going?

1020
01:24:25,059 --> 01:24:28,392
- Dad, where are we going?
- I don't know.

1021
01:24:43,877 --> 01:24:46,277
It's not a time machine.

1022
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:47,913
Dad.

1023
01:24:48,282 --> 01:24:49,613
It's not a time machine.

1024
01:24:49,817 --> 01:24:53,082
The guy said it was a time machine.
It's not a time machine. He was wrong.

1025
01:24:53,487 --> 01:24:55,853
- What guy?
- The guy. He was at the park.

1026
01:24:56,090 --> 01:24:57,990
He said it was a time machine.

1027
01:25:04,298 --> 01:25:05,560
Yes, it is.

1028
01:25:07,134 --> 01:25:08,931
No, it's not.

1029
01:25:10,938 --> 01:25:12,906
- It is.
- No, it's not.

1030
01:25:19,113 --> 01:25:23,641
All we gotta do is push
this black button right here.

1031
01:25:26,820 --> 01:25:27,980
Wanna push it?

1032
01:25:32,493 --> 01:25:34,154
Okay.

1033
01:25:35,729 --> 01:25:37,287
Come on.

1034
01:25:38,799 --> 01:25:40,426
Come on, man.

1035
01:25:46,106 --> 01:25:47,164
Right here.

1036
01:25:47,574 --> 01:25:49,166
Wait a minute.
Where you wanna go?

1037
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:51,535
I don't know.
Some place from before.

1038
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:53,307
You gotta close your eyes.

1039
01:25:53,614 --> 01:25:55,479
You close your eyes. I wanna see.

1040
01:25:57,651 --> 01:26:00,085
All right, come on.
We'll push it together.

1041
01:26:05,859 --> 01:26:07,690
You gotta close your eyes.
Close your eyes.

1042
01:26:08,395 --> 01:26:10,590
It takes a few seconds.

1043
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,900
Oh, my goodness.

1044
01:26:15,102 --> 01:26:17,297
Open, open, open!

1045
01:26:20,674 --> 01:26:23,336
- What is it?
- Dinosaurs.

1046
01:26:23,544 --> 01:26:25,739
- Where?
- You don't see all these dinosaurs?

1047
01:26:27,114 --> 01:26:30,777
Look around.
Look at all these dinosaurs.

1048
01:26:32,519 --> 01:26:34,919
- Can you see them?
- Yeah.

1049
01:26:35,122 --> 01:26:36,521
Wait. Come on, come on.

1050
01:26:36,723 --> 01:26:38,054
- Wait, watch out.
- What is it?

1051
01:26:38,258 --> 01:26:40,317
Don't step in the fire.
We're cavemen.

1052
01:26:40,661 --> 01:26:42,925
We need this fire,
because there's no electricity...

1053
01:26:43,130 --> 01:26:44,529
...and it's cold out here, okay?

1054
01:26:45,232 --> 01:26:47,598
- Watch out!
- Whoa! Oh, my good... A T. Rex.

1055
01:26:47,801 --> 01:26:51,430
Get your stuff.
Get your stuff. Get it.

1056
01:26:52,406 --> 01:26:55,500
- We gotta find someplace safe.
- Like what?

1057
01:26:55,709 --> 01:26:57,677
We need a cave.

1058
01:26:57,878 --> 01:26:58,970
A cave?

1059
01:26:59,179 --> 01:27:01,204
- We gotta find a cave. Come on.
- Okay.

1060
01:27:01,415 --> 01:27:03,178
Come on, come on.

1061
01:27:04,751 --> 01:27:06,150
Watch your back! Look out.

1062
01:27:06,353 --> 01:27:08,378
Here it is. Here's a cave. Come on.

1063
01:27:08,589 --> 01:27:11,490
Right here, right here.
Go, go, go.

1064
01:27:11,692 --> 01:27:12,920
Go ahead. Get in.

1065
01:27:13,126 --> 01:27:14,991
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1066
01:27:18,599 --> 01:27:22,365
- Are we safe?
- Yeah, I think so.

1067
01:28:30,337 --> 01:28:31,964
Hey.

1068
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:35,201
- How you doing, Jay?
- I'm doing good.

1069
01:28:35,409 --> 01:28:36,842
How are you getting along?

1070
01:28:37,044 --> 01:28:39,239
- Good. I'm good.
- You doing good?

1071
01:28:39,446 --> 01:28:41,971
- How you doing?
- I'm doing great.

1072
01:28:43,116 --> 01:28:44,743
Where you going?

1073
01:28:48,021 --> 01:28:51,047
L... Sacramento.

1074
01:28:51,725 --> 01:28:54,353
Because I'm trying to move
a couple guys from...

1075
01:28:54,561 --> 01:28:57,189
They're at PacBell,
and I'm trying to bring them over...

1076
01:28:57,397 --> 01:28:58,659
Get them over to us.

1077
01:28:58,865 --> 01:29:00,594
So they got me
going out there golfing.

1078
01:29:00,801 --> 01:29:02,632
Awesome.

1079
01:29:02,836 --> 01:29:04,804
Hey, let them win a round.

1080
01:29:09,976 --> 01:29:11,967
Deborah, someone's asking for you.

1081
01:29:12,179 --> 01:29:15,273
- Where?
- He's outside. Please come with me.

1082
01:29:23,123 --> 01:29:24,681
Hi.

1083
01:29:28,028 --> 01:29:30,553
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

1084
01:29:32,799 --> 01:29:34,426
We need a room.

1085
01:29:35,035 --> 01:29:38,004
Just until I can fix this and sell it.

1086
01:29:38,205 --> 01:29:40,833
- There's just some glass work.
- Let me stop you right there.

1087
01:29:41,041 --> 01:29:43,509
- I wish I could help you...
- This is my son, Christopher.

1088
01:29:43,844 --> 01:29:45,835
- He's 5 years old.
- Hi, baby.

1089
01:29:46,046 --> 01:29:49,106
- We need some place to stay.
- Okay, and I would love to help you...

1090
01:29:49,316 --> 01:29:52,183
...but we don't take men here.
It's only women and children.

1091
01:29:52,386 --> 01:29:55,446
He can stay here, but you have
to find someplace else to go.

1092
01:29:55,655 --> 01:29:57,054
We gotta stay together.

1093
01:29:57,257 --> 01:29:58,622
We got... We're...

1094
01:29:58,825 --> 01:30:00,656
- Okay, listen.
- You gotta have some place...

1095
01:30:00,861 --> 01:30:03,728
Try Glide Memorial.
The building books up at 5.

1096
01:30:03,930 --> 01:30:05,420
So you hurry up. There's a line.

1097
01:30:05,632 --> 01:30:09,033
- And where is it? Come on.
- Ellis and Jones.

1098
01:30:44,271 --> 01:30:49,903
Hey, everybody. We have
four spots left, and that's all.

1099
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:53,211
- Man.
- Hey, come on, man.

1100
01:30:53,413 --> 01:30:54,607
- Come on.
- Come on, what?

1101
01:30:54,815 --> 01:30:56,407
- Hey, that's my spot.
- Back off.

1102
01:30:56,616 --> 01:30:59,050
Come on, don't do this to me.
Don't...

1103
01:31:01,421 --> 01:31:02,979
Dad!

1104
01:31:03,423 --> 01:31:05,482
Stop it! Break it up!
Break it up!

1105
01:31:05,692 --> 01:31:07,284
Stop! Stop!

1106
01:31:07,494 --> 01:31:09,792
Get out of the line, both of you.
Both of you.

1107
01:31:09,996 --> 01:31:12,590
I was here first. They told me
that we had to be on time.

1108
01:31:12,899 --> 01:31:14,833
I got here on time. I was in line.

1109
01:31:15,035 --> 01:31:16,798
I came from work, I got my son.

1110
01:31:17,003 --> 01:31:19,528
I was here on time.
We were here on time!

1111
01:31:19,739 --> 01:31:21,331
He sliced in front of him in line.

1112
01:31:21,541 --> 01:31:23,839
- Who did?
- He did.

1113
01:31:24,110 --> 01:31:28,638
Come on, come on, Rodney.
Come on. Let's go. Get out of line.

1114
01:31:37,891 --> 01:31:39,882
That's it. No more.

1115
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:49,869
- What's your favorite color?
- Green.

1116
01:31:50,070 --> 01:31:51,332
Green?

1117
01:31:51,538 --> 01:31:54,530
- What do you like that's green?
- Trees.

1118
01:31:54,741 --> 01:31:57,733
Trees. What else?

1119
01:31:57,944 --> 01:31:59,411
Holly.

1120
01:32:01,181 --> 01:32:05,140
- Holly. What's holly?
- The Christmas stuff.

1121
01:32:05,886 --> 01:32:07,877
Christmas stuff.

1122
01:32:08,688 --> 01:32:10,451
What's that?

1123
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:16,561
I guess they want us to go to sleep.

1124
01:32:23,136 --> 01:32:28,130
Here you go. We gotta make sure
Captain America's warm in there.

1125
01:32:28,575 --> 01:32:30,304
Can you breathe?

1126
01:32:30,510 --> 01:32:32,774
- You're good?
- Yeah.

1127
01:32:33,213 --> 01:32:35,204
- I gotta go work on the scanner...
- Don't go.

1128
01:32:35,415 --> 01:32:38,612
No, no, no. I'm gonna be
right outside the door.

1129
01:32:38,818 --> 01:32:42,948
All right? I'm just gonna be right there.
I'll leave the door open a little bit.

1130
01:32:43,423 --> 01:32:46,119
And I'll be able to hear you
if you call me.

1131
01:32:46,326 --> 01:32:48,817
I wanna go home.

1132
01:32:50,897 --> 01:32:54,697
But that's why I gotta
work on the scanner.

1133
01:32:55,635 --> 01:32:57,398
All right?

1134
01:32:57,604 --> 01:32:59,538
I'm gonna go out there.

1135
01:32:59,739 --> 01:33:03,106
I'm gonna leave the door open.
I'll be right up the stairs.

1136
01:33:04,210 --> 01:33:05,905
I'll be able to hear you
if you call me.

1137
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:09,007
- All right?
- All right.

1138
01:33:09,215 --> 01:33:11,547
You gotta trust me, okay?

1139
01:33:11,751 --> 01:33:13,776
You gotta trust me.

1140
01:33:14,654 --> 01:33:17,316
I trust you. I trust you.

1141
01:33:17,524 --> 01:33:18,957
I trust you.

1142
01:33:19,159 --> 01:33:22,151
- I can't hear you.
- I trust you. I trust you.

1143
01:33:25,966 --> 01:33:27,695
Give me a kiss.

1144
01:33:40,347 --> 01:33:43,316
- I'll just be a little while, okay?
- All right.

1145
01:33:43,783 --> 01:33:46,251
- I'll be right here.
- Okay.

1146
01:33:46,453 --> 01:33:48,648
- Can you still hear me?
- Yeah.

1147
01:33:48,855 --> 01:33:50,345
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

1148
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:53,058
- Do you trust me?
- Yeah.

1149
01:34:40,273 --> 01:34:41,934
- Yeah.
- Like that?

1150
01:34:42,142 --> 01:34:45,805
- Yeah, put that...
- Then you go like that.

1151
01:34:46,012 --> 01:34:49,504
- Is that okay?
- I don't know. What do you think?

1152
01:34:49,716 --> 01:34:50,774
Good.

1153
01:34:52,118 --> 01:34:54,348
Let's go. Get your stuff.

1154
01:34:55,588 --> 01:34:58,557
- Hey, why don't you leave it?
- We can't.

1155
01:34:58,758 --> 01:35:00,885
We're gonna have
a different room later.

1156
01:35:01,094 --> 01:35:02,652
Go.

1157
01:35:08,001 --> 01:35:09,366
Hey, Chris.

1158
01:35:09,569 --> 01:35:12,902
- Hey, good morning, Mr. Frakesh.
- What's up?

1159
01:35:13,940 --> 01:35:15,100
Work trip.

1160
01:35:15,308 --> 01:35:17,572
Your wife, Martha, works at
PacBell also, correct?

1161
01:35:17,777 --> 01:35:19,540
- Yes, she does.
- And you guys are both...

1162
01:35:19,746 --> 01:35:21,407
...looking to retire at the same time?

1163
01:35:21,614 --> 01:35:23,707
We'd like to retire
and maintain our lifestyle...

1164
01:35:23,917 --> 01:35:25,350
...without paying a lot of taxes.

1165
01:35:25,552 --> 01:35:29,044
So basically, you want nobody's hands
in your pockets but your own?

1166
01:35:29,656 --> 01:35:31,556
Are you familiar with
tax-free municipal?

1167
01:35:31,758 --> 01:35:33,658
I learned to finish my work quickly.

1168
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:36,155
I had to finish quickly.

1169
01:35:36,496 --> 01:35:39,988
To get in line at Glide by 5.

1170
01:35:43,703 --> 01:35:45,637
Come on.

1171
01:35:46,106 --> 01:35:47,698
Come on.

1172
01:35:51,778 --> 01:35:54,576
Hold that bus! Hold the bus!

1173
01:35:55,448 --> 01:35:57,211
My Captain America!

1174
01:35:57,450 --> 01:35:59,748
Dad! Dad! Dad!

1175
01:35:59,953 --> 01:36:03,218
Stop it! Shut up! Shut up!

1176
01:36:05,558 --> 01:36:07,583
- Why don't you let the lady in?
- Hey, back up.

1177
01:36:07,794 --> 01:36:10,854
- Hey, man, that's not cool.
- Back up! Back up!

1178
01:36:19,172 --> 01:36:20,639
Come on.

1179
01:36:23,643 --> 01:36:25,873
Dad, we need to get it!

1180
01:36:28,481 --> 01:36:31,109
The important thing about
that freedom train...

1181
01:36:31,317 --> 01:36:33,478
...is it's got to climb mountains.

1182
01:36:33,686 --> 01:36:36,450
We all have to deal with mountains.

1183
01:36:36,656 --> 01:36:39,591
You know, mountains
that go way up high.

1184
01:36:39,993 --> 01:36:42,018
And mountains that go
deep and low.

1185
01:36:42,228 --> 01:36:43,490
- Amen, preacher!
- Yes.

1186
01:36:43,696 --> 01:36:45,994
We know what those mountains are,
here at Glide.

1187
01:36:46,299 --> 01:36:48,426
We sing about them.

1188
01:36:49,202 --> 01:36:54,731
Lord, don't move that mountain

1189
01:36:56,142 --> 01:37:02,570
Give me strength to climb it

1190
01:37:03,082 --> 01:37:09,749
Please don't move
That stumbling block

1191
01:37:09,956 --> 01:37:16,520
But lead me, Lord, around it

1192
01:37:18,164 --> 01:37:23,192
My burdens, they get so heavy

1193
01:37:25,038 --> 01:37:30,670
Seems hard to bear

1194
01:37:31,611 --> 01:37:35,172
But I won't give up
No, no

1195
01:37:35,381 --> 01:37:37,406
Because you promised me

1196
01:37:37,617 --> 01:37:44,352
You'd meet me at the altar of prayer

1197
01:37:44,557 --> 01:37:52,089
- Lord don't move that mountain
- Please don't move that mountain

1198
01:37:52,298 --> 01:37:57,565
But give me strength to climb it

1199
01:37:59,806 --> 01:38:01,797
When's your test?

1200
01:38:03,009 --> 01:38:04,499
Tomorrow.

1201
01:38:08,882 --> 01:38:10,679
Are you ready?

1202
01:38:14,587 --> 01:38:16,020
Of course.

1203
01:38:55,128 --> 01:38:56,425
Thank you, sir.

1204
01:39:05,805 --> 01:39:08,000
- Hey. How you doing?
- Hey.

1205
01:39:12,011 --> 01:39:15,003
So did you finish the whole thing,
or you have to go somewhere?

1206
01:39:15,214 --> 01:39:17,682
I have to go somewhere.

1207
01:39:18,251 --> 01:39:21,084
- But I finished the whole thing too.
- Oh, good.

1208
01:39:21,287 --> 01:39:23,221
- You?
- Yeah.

1209
01:39:23,723 --> 01:39:26,692
- How'd you feel about the graphs?
- Easy.

1210
01:39:27,694 --> 01:39:31,755
I struggled with the essay question
on the back. What did you write?

1211
01:39:31,965 --> 01:39:35,594
- Essay question?
- Yeah, on the back.

1212
01:39:45,511 --> 01:39:46,876
Hey, Chris.

1213
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:50,345
- Hey. Jeff, right? 49ers game.
- Yeah.

1214
01:39:50,550 --> 01:39:54,042
- Yeah, you were gonna give me a call?
- I never actually got your number.

1215
01:39:55,788 --> 01:39:57,756
Here's my number. Call me, okay?

1216
01:39:57,957 --> 01:40:00,619
Yes, sir. Absolutely.
Thank you very much.

1217
01:40:01,394 --> 01:40:05,160
Chris, you got five bucks?
I left my wallet upstairs.

1218
01:40:05,365 --> 01:40:07,629
Let me run up and grab that
for you, Mr. Frohm.

1219
01:40:07,834 --> 01:40:10,826
No, I gotta be at CAL Bank at 4,
and I'm late.

1220
01:40:16,209 --> 01:40:18,370
- I'll pay you back, honest.
- Five is good?

1221
01:40:18,578 --> 01:40:22,207
Five is lovely. Thank you.
Thank you.

1222
01:40:35,561 --> 01:40:38,052
That's it. That's the room quota.

1223
01:40:38,431 --> 01:40:41,195
There's no more space.
You gotta head out.

1224
01:40:41,401 --> 01:40:44,302
That's it for today.
Come back tomorrow.

1225
01:40:44,504 --> 01:40:47,496
All the rooms are full.
It's completely full.

1226
01:40:47,707 --> 01:40:52,007
That's it. Just keep heading out.
Come back tomorrow.

1227
01:41:26,979 --> 01:41:28,742
You like it?

1228
01:42:19,799 --> 01:42:23,462
Twenty. One, two, three, four.

1229
01:42:26,572 --> 01:42:30,167
Now, here's your bulb,
and there's your ferrite core inductor.

1230
01:42:30,376 --> 01:42:33,174
- How much?
- Eight dollars.

1231
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:37,613
- What's that?
- It's to repair the light.

1232
01:42:37,817 --> 01:42:39,842
Can I see it?

1233
01:42:41,754 --> 01:42:44,814
Yeah, sure. Just don't break it.

1234
01:42:45,024 --> 01:42:49,518
Unless you wanna sleep in a room
with me for the rest of your life.

1235
01:42:50,730 --> 01:42:52,595
I don't mind.

1236
01:42:53,065 --> 01:42:54,896
Yeah, you will.

1237
01:43:11,184 --> 01:43:13,550
Why don't you
get some sleep, okay?

1238
01:43:13,753 --> 01:43:14,913
Okay.

1239
01:43:15,121 --> 01:43:18,215
- Warm enough?
- Yeah.

1240
01:43:18,491 --> 01:43:20,152
All right.

1241
01:43:22,261 --> 01:43:25,162
Did Mom leave because of me?

1242
01:43:28,501 --> 01:43:32,699
- What?
- Did Mom leave because of me?

1243
01:43:37,276 --> 01:43:41,804
Don't... Don't even think
something like that.

1244
01:43:42,882 --> 01:43:45,009
Mom left because of Mom.

1245
01:43:45,218 --> 01:43:47,482
And you didn't have anything
to do with that, okay?

1246
01:43:48,187 --> 01:43:50,087
Okay.

1247
01:43:59,932 --> 01:44:01,991
You're a good papa.

1248
01:44:09,842 --> 01:44:11,833
All right, go to sleep.

1249
01:44:12,645 --> 01:44:15,580
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1250
01:45:12,038 --> 01:45:14,029
So far, so good, Chris.

1251
01:45:20,112 --> 01:45:22,672
- It works.
- Thank you very much.

1252
01:45:22,882 --> 01:45:26,716
Two hundred and fifty dollars.
Four more weeks of oxygen.

1253
01:45:27,053 --> 01:45:31,285
One hundred, 20, 40, 60, 80, 200.

1254
01:45:31,490 --> 01:45:34,254
Twenty, 30, 40, 50.

1255
01:45:35,394 --> 01:45:37,021
- Anything else?
- No, sir.

1256
01:45:37,229 --> 01:45:38,560
Thank you. Thank you.

1257
01:45:38,764 --> 01:45:40,698
- You ready?
- Yep.

1258
01:45:42,635 --> 01:45:45,536
- Are we going to the church place?
- No.

1259
01:45:45,738 --> 01:45:47,706
Where are we going, then?

1260
01:45:48,507 --> 01:45:51,067
- Probably stay at a hotel.
- A hotel?

1261
01:45:51,277 --> 01:45:52,335
Just for the night.

1262
01:45:52,545 --> 01:45:55,309
We can go back to the cave
if you like.

1263
01:45:55,514 --> 01:45:57,243
No, thank you.

1264
01:45:57,450 --> 01:45:59,975
- Ever?
- I hope not.

1265
01:46:00,186 --> 01:46:01,653
Why not?

1266
01:46:01,854 --> 01:46:04,652
Well, because some things are fun
the first time you do them...

1267
01:46:04,857 --> 01:46:07,189
...and then not so much the next.

1268
01:46:07,393 --> 01:46:10,294
- Like the bus?
- Yeah, like the bus.

1269
01:46:10,496 --> 01:46:13,693
I'm sorry, I shouldn't laugh,
should I?

1270
01:46:26,712 --> 01:46:28,407
Sometimes when we're moving
at night...

1271
01:46:28,614 --> 01:46:31,344
...we pass houses with lights
and people.

1272
01:46:32,118 --> 01:46:33,983
Sometimes you can
hear them laugh.

1273
01:46:39,392 --> 01:46:42,759
The next day, after work...

1274
01:46:42,962 --> 01:46:45,192
...we just went to the beach.

1275
01:46:45,398 --> 01:46:47,298
Far away from anything.

1276
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:48,865
Everything.

1277
01:46:49,068 --> 01:46:50,729
Just Christopher and me.

1278
01:46:52,371 --> 01:46:54,737
- Did you see me?
- Yeah.

1279
01:46:54,940 --> 01:46:58,034
Far away from buses and noise...

1280
01:46:58,244 --> 01:47:03,876
...and a constant disappointment
in my ten-gallon head...

1281
01:47:05,050 --> 01:47:06,915
...and myself.

1282
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:09,886
- Chris, thank you very much.
- Well, thank you, Dean.

1283
01:47:10,089 --> 01:47:11,920
- Take care.
- You made all the right moves.

1284
01:47:12,124 --> 01:47:13,648
Thanks, Chris.

1285
01:47:15,728 --> 01:47:17,059
Because when I was young...

1286
01:47:17,263 --> 01:47:21,029
...and I'd get an A on a history test
or whatever...

1287
01:47:21,233 --> 01:47:25,829
...I'd get this good feeling about
all the things that I could be.

1288
01:47:27,740 --> 01:47:31,369
And then I never became
any of them.

1289
01:47:38,884 --> 01:47:41,409
- Hey, Chris.
- Hey.

1290
01:47:41,620 --> 01:47:44,248
- How you doing, Jay?
- I'm doing fine.

1291
01:47:44,457 --> 01:47:48,587
Rumor has it you signed 31 accounts
for us from Pacific Bell.

1292
01:47:48,794 --> 01:47:50,227
Yeah, yeah.

1293
01:47:50,429 --> 01:47:54,229
Met some guys at a ball game,
got some cards. I've been working.

1294
01:47:54,433 --> 01:47:56,060
I guess.

1295
01:47:59,038 --> 01:48:01,268
So one more day.

1296
01:48:01,474 --> 01:48:03,066
Getting nervous?

1297
01:48:03,642 --> 01:48:06,008
- No, I'm okay.
- Yeah?

1298
01:48:06,212 --> 01:48:08,146
Listen, whatever happens...

1299
01:48:08,347 --> 01:48:10,781
...you've done a fantastic job, Chris.

1300
01:48:10,983 --> 01:48:12,541
I mean that.

1301
01:48:13,385 --> 01:48:15,216
Take care of yourself.

1302
01:48:30,202 --> 01:48:33,399
Yes, Mr. Johnson.
Chris Gardner, Dean Witter.

1303
01:48:33,706 --> 01:48:35,799
Yes, sir. Just calling
to thank you very much...

1304
01:48:36,008 --> 01:48:38,499
...for your support
at last month's seminar.

1305
01:48:39,044 --> 01:48:40,705
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

1306
01:48:41,347 --> 01:48:42,974
Yes, sir.

1307
01:48:43,182 --> 01:48:44,547
No, sir, that's it.

1308
01:48:44,750 --> 01:48:47,241
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

1309
01:48:48,854 --> 01:48:51,721
Chris. Come.

1310
01:49:19,118 --> 01:49:22,212
- Hi, Chris.
- Mr. Frohm, good to see you.

1311
01:49:23,355 --> 01:49:25,289
- Nice shirt.
- Thank you, sir.

1312
01:49:25,491 --> 01:49:26,685
- Chris.
- Hey, Jay.

1313
01:49:27,126 --> 01:49:31,392
- Chris.
- Chris, sit down, please.

1314
01:49:34,333 --> 01:49:38,394
I thought I'd wear a shirt today.

1315
01:49:38,604 --> 01:49:40,572
You know,
being the last day and all.

1316
01:49:40,773 --> 01:49:44,106
Well, thank you. Thank you.
We appreciate that.

1317
01:49:45,010 --> 01:49:46,773
But...

1318
01:49:46,979 --> 01:49:49,777
...wear one tomorrow though, okay?

1319
01:49:49,982 --> 01:49:52,917
Because tomorrow's
going to be your first day...

1320
01:49:53,652 --> 01:49:56,883
...if you'd like to work here
as a broker.

1321
01:49:58,223 --> 01:50:00,054
Would you like that, Chris?

1322
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,552
Yes, sir.

1323
01:50:02,761 --> 01:50:06,128
Good. We couldn't be happier.

1324
01:50:07,099 --> 01:50:10,262
So welcome.

1325
01:50:12,137 --> 01:50:17,131
- Was it as easy as it looked?
- No, sir. No, sir, it wasn't.

1326
01:50:19,478 --> 01:50:21,878
- Good luck, Chris.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1327
01:50:28,287 --> 01:50:30,152
Oh, Chris.

1328
01:50:32,658 --> 01:50:34,751
I almost forgot.

1329
01:50:36,795 --> 01:50:38,353
Thank you.

1330
01:50:58,751 --> 01:51:00,946
This part of my life...

1331
01:51:01,854 --> 01:51:04,049
...this little part...

1332
01:51:07,393 --> 01:51:10,021
...is called "Happiness."

1333
01:51:56,742 --> 01:52:00,371
Christopher. Christopher.
Come here.

1334
01:52:30,042 --> 01:52:32,442
So how many...

1335
01:52:32,644 --> 01:52:34,578
...planets are there?

1336
01:52:35,881 --> 01:52:37,678
- Seven.
- Seven?

1337
01:52:38,183 --> 01:52:40,014
Nine.

1338
01:52:42,387 --> 01:52:44,446
Who's the king of the jungle?

1339
01:52:44,857 --> 01:52:47,587
- Gorilla.
- The gorilla?

1340
01:52:47,893 --> 01:52:49,292
The gorilla?

1341
01:52:49,495 --> 01:52:51,156
No. Lion.

1342
01:52:51,363 --> 01:52:53,957
Oh, yeah. Lion, lion, lion.

1343
01:52:56,034 --> 01:52:59,026
Hey, Dad, listen to this.
Knock, knock.

1344
01:52:59,238 --> 01:53:01,172
- Who's there?
- Shelby.

1345
01:53:01,373 --> 01:53:02,465
Shelby who?

1346
01:53:02,674 --> 01:53:06,474
Shelby coming around the mountain
When she comes

1347
01:53:07,312 --> 01:53:08,677
- Knock knock.
- Who's there?

1348
01:53:08,881 --> 01:53:11,349
- Nobody.
- Nobody who?

1349
01:53:12,251 --> 01:53:14,014
Nobody who?

1350
01:53:17,322 --> 01:53:20,291
Now, that's funny. I like that one.
