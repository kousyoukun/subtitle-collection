1
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:55,357
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

2
00:01:55,487 --> 00:01:57,523
Tell them we wish
to board at once.

3
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:00,320
With all due respect...

4
00:02:00,447 --> 00:02:03,519
the ambassadors for the supreme
chancellor wish to board immediately.

5
00:02:03,647 --> 00:02:05,444
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

6
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:08,525
<i>As you know,
our blockade is perfectly legal...</i>

7
00:02:08,647 --> 00:02:12,560
<i>and we'd be happy
to receive the ambassadors.</i>

8
00:02:34,127 --> 00:02:36,641
I'm TC-14 at your service.

9
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:38,564
This way, please.

10
00:02:44,447 --> 00:02:47,359
We are greatly honoured
by your visit, Ambassadors.

11
00:02:47,487 --> 00:02:49,284
Make yourselves comfortable.

12
00:02:49,407 --> 00:02:51,637
My master
will be with you shortly.

13
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:57,562
I have a bad feeling about this.

14
00:02:57,687 --> 00:03:00,565
- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.

15
00:03:00,687 --> 00:03:04,441
It's something elsewhere, elusive.

16
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:06,842
Don't centre on your anxieties,
Obi-Wan.

17
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:09,959
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.

18
00:03:10,087 --> 00:03:12,806
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

19
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:14,838
But not at the expense
of the moment.

20
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:17,765
<i>Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.</i>

21
00:03:17,887 --> 00:03:19,718
Yes, Master.

22
00:03:21,847 --> 00:03:25,317
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

23
00:03:25,447 --> 00:03:27,483
These Federation types are cowards.

24
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,326
The negotiations will be short.

25
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:33,601
What? What did you say?

26
00:03:33,727 --> 00:03:36,560
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

27
00:03:37,287 --> 00:03:38,436
I knew it.

28
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:40,717
They're here to force a settlement.

29
00:03:42,007 --> 00:03:44,965
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

30
00:03:45,087 --> 00:03:46,600
Are you brain-dead?

31
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,446
I'm not going in there
with two Jedi.

32
00:03:51,047 --> 00:03:52,400
Send a droid.

33
00:03:57,647 --> 00:03:59,444
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

34
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:01,762
No. I sense
an unusual amount of fear...

35
00:04:01,887 --> 00:04:03,923
for something as trivial
as this trade dispute.

36
00:04:14,407 --> 00:04:16,204
<i>What is it?</i>

37
00:04:16,327 --> 00:04:18,887
This scheme of yours has failed,
Lord Sidious.

38
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:22,397
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

39
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:27,123
<i>Viceroy, I don't want
this stunted slime in my sight again.</i>

40
00:04:28,447 --> 00:04:32,326
<i>This turn of events is unfortunate.
We must accelerate our plans.</i>

41
00:04:32,447 --> 00:04:34,881
<i>Begin landing your troops.</i>

42
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:38,556
My lord, is that legal?

43
00:04:38,687 --> 00:04:40,882
<i>I will make it legal.</i>

44
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:43,202
And the Jedi?

45
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:45,716
<i>The chancellor should never have
brought them into this.</i>

46
00:04:45,847 --> 00:04:47,519
<i>Kill them immediately.</i>

47
00:04:47,647 --> 00:04:51,765
Yes, my lord.
As you wish.

48
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:55,285
Captain, look!

49
00:04:56,367 --> 00:04:57,686
Shields-

50
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:02,844
Sorry.

51
00:05:04,527 --> 00:05:06,324
Dioxis.

52
00:05:11,007 --> 00:05:13,475
<i>They must be dead by now.</i>

53
00:05:13,607 --> 00:05:16,167
<i>Destroy what's left of them.</i>

54
00:05:23,967 --> 00:05:26,242
Oh! Excuse me.

55
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,200
- Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
- Roger, roger.

56
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:31,719
Uh-oh. Blast them.

57
00:05:37,247 --> 00:05:38,726
What is going on down there?

58
00:05:38,847 --> 00:05:40,724
We lost the transmission, sir.

59
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:47,925
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?

60
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,880
Well, no, but I don't-
Seal off the bridge.

61
00:05:51,007 --> 00:05:53,601
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

62
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:55,604
I want droidekas
up here at once!

63
00:05:55,727 --> 00:05:58,161
We will not survive this.

64
00:06:09,247 --> 00:06:10,600
Close the blast doors!

65
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:19,037
That will hold them.

66
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:29,761
They are still coming through.

67
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,718
This is impossible!

68
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:38,766
Where are those droidekas?

69
00:06:40,287 --> 00:06:41,959
Master! Destroyers!

70
00:06:48,127 --> 00:06:49,446
They have shield generators!

71
00:06:50,847 --> 00:06:53,441
It's a standoff.
Let's go.

72
00:06:57,447 --> 00:06:59,836
They're no match for droidekas.

73
00:06:59,967 --> 00:07:01,559
Sir!

74
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:04,247
They've gone up
the ventilation shaft.

75
00:07:12,687 --> 00:07:15,247
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.

76
00:07:16,927 --> 00:07:19,487
This is an odd play
for the Trade Federation.

77
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:22,565
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

78
00:07:22,687 --> 00:07:24,166
Let's split up.

79
00:07:24,287 --> 00:07:27,359
Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.

80
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,239
You were right
about one thing, Master.

81
00:07:31,127 --> 00:07:33,687
The negotiations were short.

82
00:07:34,807 --> 00:07:37,116
Sir, a transmission
from the planet.

83
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:39,238
It's Queen Amidala herself.

84
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:41,676
At last we are getting results.

85
00:07:43,007 --> 00:07:45,885
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.

86
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,965
<i>You will not be so pleased when you hear
what I have to say, Viceroy.</i>

87
00:07:49,087 --> 00:07:52,636
<i>Your trade boycott
of our planet has ended.</i>

88
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:55,201
I was not aware of such failure.

89
00:07:55,327 --> 00:07:57,921
<i>I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...</i>

90
00:07:58,047 --> 00:08:00,641
<i>and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.</i>

91
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,917
I know nothing
of any ambassadors.

92
00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:05,322
You must be mistaken.

93
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:07,358
<i>Beware, Viceroy.</i>

94
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,081
<i>The Federation
has gone too far this time.</i>

95
00:08:10,207 --> 00:08:14,086
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

96
00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:16,596
You assume too much.

97
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:18,046
<i>We will see.</i>

98
00:08:19,607 --> 00:08:23,441
- She's right. The senate will never-
- It's too late now.

99
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:26,400
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

100
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:30,679
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.

101
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:39,562
<i>Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?</i>

102
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,757
<i>How could that be true?</i>

103
00:08:41,887 --> 00:08:46,039
<i>I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.</i>

104
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:49,762
<i>It must- handiwork-
negotiate- ambassadors-</i>

105
00:08:49,887 --> 00:08:52,401
<i>- nobody would-
- Senator Palpatine.</i>

106
00:08:52,527 --> 00:08:54,324
What's happening?

107
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:56,244
Check the transmission generator.

108
00:08:56,367 --> 00:09:00,997
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.

109
00:09:01,127 --> 00:09:03,322
The Federation
would not dare go that far.

110
00:09:03,447 --> 00:09:07,076
The senate would revoke their trade
franchise, and they'd be finished.

111
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:09,926
We must continue to rely
on negotiation.

112
00:09:10,047 --> 00:09:13,119
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.

113
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:15,477
And where are
the chancellor's ambassadors?

114
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:19,122
This is a dangerous situation,
Your Highness.

115
00:09:19,247 --> 00:09:21,238
Our security volunteers
will be no match...

116
00:09:21,367 --> 00:09:23,403
against a battle-hardened
Federation army.

117
00:09:24,927 --> 00:09:28,476
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

118
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:06,405
<i>- Yes, Viceroy?
- Captain, we've searched the ship...</i>

119
00:10:06,527 --> 00:10:08,563
<i>and there is no trace of theJedi.</i>

120
00:10:08,687 --> 00:10:11,326
<i>They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.</i>

121
00:10:11,447 --> 00:10:13,802
If they're down here, sir,
we'll find them.

122
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:18,079
<i>Use caution.
TheseJedi are not to be underestimated.</i>

123
00:10:31,327 --> 00:10:33,045
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!

124
00:10:33,927 --> 00:10:35,758
Get down!

125
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:48,120
Was'n dat?
Hey, wait!

126
00:10:49,007 --> 00:10:50,679
Oh, mooie-mooie,
I love you.

127
00:10:50,807 --> 00:10:52,763
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

128
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:54,445
I spake.

129
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:56,603
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

130
00:10:56,727 --> 00:10:59,480
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.

131
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:02,519
Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

132
00:11:02,647 --> 00:11:04,638
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, but it 'tis.

133
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:07,520
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.

134
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,478
- Oh, no!
- Stay down!

135
00:11:17,487 --> 00:11:19,159
You saved my again.

136
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:21,084
- What's this?
- A local.

137
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:23,641
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.

138
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,998
More?
"More" did you spake?

139
00:11:27,127 --> 00:11:31,803
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

140
00:11:31,927 --> 00:11:34,999
Is where I grew up.
'Tis a hidden city.

141
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:38,364
- A city?
- Uh-huh.

142
00:11:38,487 --> 00:11:40,205
Can you take us there?

143
00:11:40,727 --> 00:11:42,445
On second thought, no.

144
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,956
- Not really, no.
- No?

145
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:47,123
'Tis embarrassing...

146
00:11:47,247 --> 00:11:51,035
but my afraid
my've been banished.

147
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:54,125
My forgotten. Da bosses
would do terrible tings to me.

148
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:57,159
Terrible tings to me
if me goen back dare.

149
00:11:57,287 --> 00:12:00,165
- You hear that?
- Yah.

150
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:03,882
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

151
00:12:04,007 --> 00:12:06,475
If they find us,
they will crush us...

152
00:12:06,607 --> 00:12:10,964
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

153
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:12,725
Oh.

154
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:14,838
Yousa point is well seen.

155
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,197
Dis way. Hurry!

156
00:12:22,287 --> 00:12:25,438
- How much further?
- Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

157
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:27,364
Ah, my warning you.

158
00:12:27,487 --> 00:12:31,446
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.

159
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:34,764
Don't worry. This hasn't been
our day for warm welcomes.

160
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:47,076
Yousa follow me now, okeyday?

161
00:13:30,527 --> 00:13:33,325
So good bein home!

162
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:51,515
Hey, yousa.
Stopa dare.

163
00:13:51,647 --> 00:13:53,877
Heyo-dales, Cap'n Tarpals.

00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:55,804

00:13:58,847 --> 00:14:01,361
Yousa in big dudu dis time.

00:14:06,927 --> 00:14:08,440
How wude.

168
00:14:16,727 --> 00:14:19,036
Yousa cannot bees hair.

169
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:23,524
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.

170
00:14:23,647 --> 00:14:28,323
A droid army is about to attack
the Naboo. We must warn them.

171
00:14:28,447 --> 00:14:31,883
Wesa no like da Naboo.

172
00:14:32,007 --> 00:14:34,680
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.

173
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,605
Day tink day brains so big.

174
00:14:37,727 --> 00:14:41,686
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control of you.

175
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:44,002
Mesa no tink so.

176
00:14:44,127 --> 00:14:46,880
Day not know of uss-en.

177
00:14:47,007 --> 00:14:49,805
You and the Naboo form
a symbiont circle.

178
00:14:49,927 --> 00:14:53,158
What happens to one of you will affect
the other. You must understand this.

179
00:14:53,287 --> 00:14:57,883
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

180
00:14:58,007 --> 00:15:00,441
Then speed us on our way.

181
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,956
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

182
00:15:03,087 --> 00:15:05,760
We could use a transport.

183
00:15:05,887 --> 00:15:08,606
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

184
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:11,685
Da speediest way tooda Naboo...

185
00:15:11,807 --> 00:15:16,323
'tis goen through the planet core.

186
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:18,244
Now...

187
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:20,085
go.

188
00:15:20,207 --> 00:15:22,357
Thank you for your help.
We leave in peace.

189
00:15:22,487 --> 00:15:24,443
Master, what's a bongo?

190
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:26,444
A transport, I hope.

191
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:28,558
Deysa setten yousa up.

192
00:15:28,687 --> 00:15:32,157
Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.

193
00:15:33,607 --> 00:15:36,280
Any help here would be hot.

194
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:39,364
Master, we're short on time.

195
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:42,961
We'll need a navigator to get us
through the planet's core.

196
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:44,964
This Gungan may be of help.

197
00:15:47,007 --> 00:15:49,919
What is to become
of Jar Jar Binks here?

198
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:54,757
Hisen to be pune-ished.

199
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,966
I saved his life.

200
00:15:57,087 --> 00:15:59,476
He owes me
what you call a "life-debt. "

201
00:15:59,607 --> 00:16:03,282
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.

202
00:16:03,407 --> 00:16:05,637
Binks...

203
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:09,555
<i>yousa havena liveplay
with thisen hisen?</i>

204
00:16:16,047 --> 00:16:17,799
Begone wit him!

205
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:22,642
Count me outta dis one.

206
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:25,759
Better dead here
than dead in da core.

207
00:16:25,887 --> 00:16:28,879
Yee gods!
What mesa sayin?

208
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:49,040
Dis is nutsen.
Oh, gooberfish!

209
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:52,284
- Why were you banished,Jar Jar?
- It's a longo tale-o...

210
00:16:52,407 --> 00:16:57,242
buta a small part of it
would be mesa... clumsy.

211
00:16:57,367 --> 00:17:01,963
- You were banished for being clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

212
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:18,406
Mesa caused mabee one two-y
lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

213
00:17:18,527 --> 00:17:20,483
Yud-say boom da gasser...

214
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:23,280
den crashin der boss's heyblibber,
den banished.

215
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:32,238
Big gooberfish!
Huge-o teeth!

216
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:46,486
- There's always a bigger fish.
- Mesa tink we goen back now.

217
00:17:57,407 --> 00:18:00,479
The invasion is on schedule,
my lord.

218
00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:03,485
<i>I have the senate
bogged down in procedures.</i>

219
00:18:03,607 --> 00:18:07,839
<i>They will have no choice but
to accept your control of the system.</i>

220
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:12,483
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

221
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,440
<i>Queen Amidala is young and naive.</i>

222
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:18,877
<i>You will find controlling her
will not be difficult.</i>

223
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,804
Yes, my lord.

224
00:18:22,207 --> 00:18:24,960
You didn't tell him
about the missing Jedi.

225
00:18:25,087 --> 00:18:29,399
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

226
00:18:33,727 --> 00:18:37,276
- Where wesa goin?
- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

227
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,080
Oh, maxi big, da Force.

228
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:42,878
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

229
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,482
- We're losing power.
- Oh, no!

230
00:18:52,207 --> 00:18:54,357
Wesa dyin' here.

231
00:18:54,487 --> 00:18:57,047
- Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
- What "yet"?

232
00:18:57,167 --> 00:19:00,000
Monsters out dare.
Leak'n in here.

233
00:19:00,127 --> 00:19:04,882
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

234
00:19:06,127 --> 00:19:08,322
Power's back.

235
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,438
Monster's back!

236
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:19,639
Relax.

237
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:21,166
You overdid it.

238
00:19:37,247 --> 00:19:39,203
Head for that outcropping.

239
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:41,158
Oh, boy.

240
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,038
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

241
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:19,727
Ah, victory.

242
00:20:32,687 --> 00:20:34,757
Dis'n loverly.

243
00:20:40,687 --> 00:20:42,917
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?

244
00:20:43,047 --> 00:20:47,040
The queen and I will sign a treaty that
will legitimize our occupation here.

245
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:50,204
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

246
00:20:50,327 --> 00:20:53,637
- I will not cooperate.
- Now, now, Your Highness.

247
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:57,726
In time, your people's suffering will
persuade you to see our point of view.

248
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,838
- Commander.
- Yes, sir.

249
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:02,525
Process them.

250
00:21:02,647 --> 00:21:04,365
Captain, take them to Camp 4.

251
00:21:04,487 --> 00:21:06,045
Roger, roger.

252
00:21:58,687 --> 00:22:00,803
We should leave the street,
Your Highness.

253
00:22:00,927 --> 00:22:02,485
Get their weapons.

254
00:22:04,247 --> 00:22:06,397
Yousa guys bombad!

255
00:22:07,967 --> 00:22:10,242
We're ambassadors
for the supreme chancellor.

256
00:22:10,367 --> 00:22:12,164
Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.

257
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:14,039
The negotiations
never took place.

258
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,442
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

259
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:18,558
They've knocked out
all our communications.

260
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:21,884
- Do you have transports?
- In the main hangar. This way.

261
00:22:26,647 --> 00:22:29,605
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

262
00:22:29,727 --> 00:22:33,117
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

263
00:22:33,247 --> 00:22:36,159
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

264
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:38,881
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

265
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:40,963
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.

266
00:22:41,087 --> 00:22:42,566
They can't afford to kill her.

267
00:22:42,687 --> 00:22:44,723
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

268
00:22:44,847 --> 00:22:46,724
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.

269
00:22:46,847 --> 00:22:48,724
My feelings tell me
they will destroy you.

270
00:22:48,847 --> 00:22:51,122
Our only hope is for the senate
to side with us.

271
00:22:51,247 --> 00:22:53,602
Senator Palpatine
will need your help.

272
00:22:53,727 --> 00:22:57,515
Either choice presents great danger...
to us all.

273
00:22:57,647 --> 00:22:59,444
We are brave, Your Highness.

274
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:02,684
If you are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.

275
00:23:02,807 --> 00:23:05,162
Then I will plead our case
to the senate.

276
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:07,885
Be careful, Governor.

277
00:23:16,447 --> 00:23:18,438
We'll need to free those pilots.

278
00:23:19,647 --> 00:23:21,444
I'll deal with that.

279
00:23:24,767 --> 00:23:25,756
Halt.

280
00:23:25,887 --> 00:23:27,479
I'm ambassador
to the supreme chancellor.

281
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:29,120
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

282
00:23:29,247 --> 00:23:32,319
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

283
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:34,961
Coruscant?
Uh, that doesn't compute.

284
00:23:35,087 --> 00:23:36,918
Uh, wait.
Uh, you're under arrest.

285
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:43,316
Come on. Move!

286
00:23:48,487 --> 00:23:49,397
Go!

287
00:24:13,927 --> 00:24:17,078
Now, stay here
and keep out of trouble.

288
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:22,797
Hello, boyos.

289
00:24:28,887 --> 00:24:30,445
There's the blockade.

290
00:24:40,447 --> 00:24:42,005
The shield generator's been hit!

291
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:51,680
How wude!

292
00:25:01,287 --> 00:25:02,800
We're losing droids fast.

293
00:25:03,607 --> 00:25:06,121
If we can't get the shield generator
fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.

294
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:09,401
The shields are gone.

295
00:25:17,207 --> 00:25:18,481
The power's back!

296
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:24,477
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

297
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:27,075
Deflector shields up at maximum.

298
00:25:36,287 --> 00:25:39,836
There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.

299
00:25:39,967 --> 00:25:42,720
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

300
00:25:42,847 --> 00:25:44,917
Here, Master.
Tatooine.

301
00:25:45,047 --> 00:25:46,639
It's small, out of the way, poor.

302
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:48,439
The Trade Federation
have no presence there.

303
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:50,364
How can you be sure?

304
00:25:50,487 --> 00:25:52,318
It's controlled by the Hutts.

305
00:25:52,447 --> 00:25:55,120
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

306
00:25:55,247 --> 00:25:57,442
- If they discovered her-
- It'd be no different than landing...

307
00:25:57,567 --> 00:25:59,364
on a system controlled
by the Federation...

308
00:25:59,487 --> 00:26:01,478
except that the Hutts
aren't looking for her...

309
00:26:01,607 --> 00:26:03,598
which gives us the advantage.

310
00:26:07,887 --> 00:26:10,765
<i>And Queen Amidala,
has she signed the treaty?</i>

311
00:26:10,887 --> 00:26:14,357
She has disappeared, my lord.

312
00:26:14,487 --> 00:26:18,480
One Naboo cruiser
got past the blockade.

313
00:26:19,127 --> 00:26:21,402
<i>I want that treaty signed.</i>

314
00:26:21,527 --> 00:26:23,483
My lord...

315
00:26:23,607 --> 00:26:26,041
it's impossible to locate the ship.

316
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,283
It's out of our range.

317
00:26:28,407 --> 00:26:30,557
<i>Not for a Sith.</i>

318
00:26:31,127 --> 00:26:32,924
<i>This is my apprentice...</i>

319
00:26:33,047 --> 00:26:34,878
<i>Darth Maul.</i>

320
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:39,318
<i>He will find your lost ship.</i>

321
00:26:43,487 --> 00:26:45,682
This is getting out of hand.

322
00:26:45,807 --> 00:26:47,763
Now there are two of them.

323
00:26:47,887 --> 00:26:50,765
We should not
have made this bargain.

324
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:59,237
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

325
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,120
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.

326
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:05,444
It is to be commended.
What is its number?

327
00:27:08,007 --> 00:27:10,043
R2-D2, Your Highness.

328
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:11,520
Thank you, R2-D2.

329
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:16,520
Padm¨¦.

330
00:27:18,007 --> 00:27:20,043
Clean this droid up
as best you can.

331
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:22,044
It deserves our gratitude.

332
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,246
Continue, Captain.

333
00:27:28,087 --> 00:27:29,839
Your Highness,
with your permission...

334
00:27:29,967 --> 00:27:32,606
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

335
00:27:32,727 --> 00:27:35,924
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

336
00:27:36,047 --> 00:27:38,515
I do not agree
with the Jedi on this.

337
00:27:38,647 --> 00:27:41,445
You must trust my judgment,
Your Highness.

338
00:27:44,727 --> 00:27:46,365
Hello.

339
00:27:46,487 --> 00:27:49,320
Sorry. Husa are yousa?

340
00:27:50,447 --> 00:27:51,800
I'm Padm¨¦.

341
00:27:52,887 --> 00:27:54,798
Mesa Jar Jar Binks.

342
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:56,835
You're a Gungan, aren't you?

343
00:27:59,047 --> 00:28:02,483
- How'd you end up here with us?
- My no know.

344
00:28:02,607 --> 00:28:06,122
Mesa day starten pitty okeyday
witda brisky morning munchen.

345
00:28:06,247 --> 00:28:08,920
Den boom!
Getten berry scared...

346
00:28:09,047 --> 00:28:12,198
and grabben dat Jedi, and pow-
mesa here.

347
00:28:13,527 --> 00:28:15,916
Mesa getten
berry, berry scared.

348
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:24,925
- That's it- Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.

349
00:28:25,047 --> 00:28:28,960
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

350
00:28:45,527 --> 00:28:48,200
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

351
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:50,682
That'll complicate things.
Be wary.

352
00:28:50,807 --> 00:28:53,799
- I sense a disturbance in the Force.
- I feel it also, Master.

353
00:28:53,927 --> 00:28:55,883
Don't let them send
any transmissions.

354
00:29:01,727 --> 00:29:04,036
The sun doen murder to mesa skin.

355
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:05,600
Wait!

356
00:29:06,647 --> 00:29:08,000
Wait.

357
00:29:11,287 --> 00:29:14,040
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

358
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:17,762
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

359
00:29:17,887 --> 00:29:19,878
The spaceport
is not going to be pleasant.

360
00:29:20,007 --> 00:29:22,043
The queen wishes it.

361
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:23,998
She's curious about the planet.

362
00:29:26,487 --> 00:29:29,399
This is not a good idea.
Stay close to me.

363
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:45,366
Moisture farms,
for the most part.

364
00:29:46,607 --> 00:29:50,156
Some indigenous tribes
and scavengers.

365
00:29:50,287 --> 00:29:52,084
The few spaceports like this one...

366
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,402
are havens for those
that don't wish to be found.

367
00:29:54,527 --> 00:29:56,358
Like us.

368
00:29:57,647 --> 00:30:00,320
Dissen berry, berry bad.

369
00:30:01,647 --> 00:30:03,285
Icky, icky goo!

370
00:30:15,767 --> 00:30:18,076
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

371
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:25,364
Good day to you.

372
00:30:26,967 --> 00:30:28,286
What do you want?

373
00:30:28,407 --> 00:30:31,365
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

374
00:30:31,487 --> 00:30:35,366
Ah, yes! Nubian.
We have lots of that.

375
00:30:36,087 --> 00:30:37,884
Boy, get in here now!

376
00:30:38,007 --> 00:30:39,804
My droid has a readout of what I need.

377
00:30:42,327 --> 00:30:43,919
What took you so long?

378
00:30:44,727 --> 00:30:46,046
I was cleaning the fan switches.

379
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:48,806
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

380
00:30:48,927 --> 00:30:52,044
So, let me take thee out back, huh?

381
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:53,964
We'll find what you need.

382
00:30:56,367 --> 00:30:58,005
Don't touch anything.

383
00:31:07,927 --> 00:31:10,680
- Are you an angel?
- What?

384
00:31:10,807 --> 00:31:14,356
An angel. I heard the deep space
pilots talk about them.

385
00:31:14,487 --> 00:31:17,240
They're the most beautiful
creatures in the universe.

386
00:31:17,367 --> 00:31:19,835
They live on the moons of lego,
I think.

387
00:31:20,607 --> 00:31:24,122
You're a funny little boy.
How do you know so much?

388
00:31:24,247 --> 00:31:27,922
I listen to all the traders
and star pilots who come through here.

389
00:31:28,047 --> 00:31:32,165
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

390
00:31:32,287 --> 00:31:36,075
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm. All my life.

391
00:31:36,207 --> 00:31:38,402
How long have you been here?

392
00:31:38,527 --> 00:31:42,361
Since I was very little.
Three, I think.

393
00:31:42,487 --> 00:31:45,081
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt...

394
00:31:45,207 --> 00:31:47,801
but she lost us
betting on the Podraces.

395
00:31:47,927 --> 00:31:49,645
You're a slave?

396
00:31:49,767 --> 00:31:53,726
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.

397
00:31:53,847 --> 00:31:57,442
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

398
00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:10,846
- I got ya.
- Hey!

399
00:32:10,967 --> 00:32:12,639
Hit the nose.

400
00:32:17,127 --> 00:32:20,517
A T-14 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.

401
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,161
I'm the only one hereabouts
who has one.

402
00:32:23,287 --> 00:32:26,643
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, I think, huh.

403
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:29,566
Saying of which...

404
00:32:29,687 --> 00:32:31,962
how's thee gonna pay
for all this, huh?

405
00:32:32,087 --> 00:32:34,043
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

406
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:35,919
Republic credits?

407
00:32:36,047 --> 00:32:38,845
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

408
00:32:38,967 --> 00:32:41,959
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

409
00:32:42,087 --> 00:32:45,557
<i>- No, they won't.
- Credits will do fine.</i>

410
00:32:45,687 --> 00:32:47,439
No, they won't!

411
00:32:47,567 --> 00:32:51,560
What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,
waving your hand around like that?

412
00:32:51,687 --> 00:32:55,760
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.

413
00:32:56,567 --> 00:32:59,798
No money, no parts, no deal.

414
00:32:59,927 --> 00:33:04,284
And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

415
00:33:10,887 --> 00:33:14,960
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.

416
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:20,364
We're leaving. Jar Jar.

417
00:33:22,887 --> 00:33:25,321
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

418
00:33:25,447 --> 00:33:27,199
I was glad to meet you too.

419
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:39,604
Outlanders.
They think we know nothing.

420
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:41,558
They seemed nice to me.

421
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,518
Clean the racks.

422
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:44,921
Then you can go home.

423
00:33:45,047 --> 00:33:46,765
Yippee!

424
00:33:52,567 --> 00:33:54,842
<i>And you're sure there's
nothing left on board?</i>

425
00:33:54,967 --> 00:33:56,764
A few containers of supplies.

426
00:33:56,887 --> 00:33:59,799
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with...

427
00:33:59,927 --> 00:34:02,157
<i>not in the amount
you're talking about.</i>

428
00:34:02,287 --> 00:34:05,085
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.

429
00:34:05,207 --> 00:34:06,526
I'll check back later.

430
00:34:07,287 --> 00:34:08,879
Noah gain. Noah gain.

431
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:11,726
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

432
00:34:11,847 --> 00:34:14,202
Wesa be wobbed un crunched.

433
00:34:14,327 --> 00:34:17,364
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.

434
00:34:32,007 --> 00:34:33,360
Are you going to pay for that?

435
00:34:35,287 --> 00:34:37,084
It costs seven wupiupi.

436
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:43,441
Oops.

437
00:34:47,767 --> 00:34:49,564
Is this yours?

438
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,359
Who, mesa-

439
00:34:55,367 --> 00:34:57,403
Careful, Sebulba.

440
00:34:57,527 --> 00:34:59,438
He's a big-time outlander.

441
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:02,957
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

442
00:35:03,087 --> 00:35:06,796
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end of you.

443
00:35:06,927 --> 00:35:09,839
If you weren't a slave,
I'd squash you now.

444
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:13,246
Yeah, it'd be a pity
if you had to pay for me.

445
00:35:14,327 --> 00:35:17,319
- Hi.
- Hi there.

446
00:35:17,447 --> 00:35:19,165
Your buddy here was
about to be turned into orange goo.

447
00:35:19,287 --> 00:35:21,084
He picked a fight with a Dug...

448
00:35:21,207 --> 00:35:23,596
an especially dangerous Dug
called Sebulba.

449
00:35:23,727 --> 00:35:27,163
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

450
00:35:27,287 --> 00:35:31,121
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

451
00:35:31,647 --> 00:35:33,046
Thanks, my young friend.

452
00:35:35,247 --> 00:35:37,044
But mesa doen nutten!

453
00:35:45,207 --> 00:35:47,675
This storm will slow them down.

454
00:35:47,807 --> 00:35:49,240
Looks pretty bad.

455
00:35:50,527 --> 00:35:52,916
<i>- Panaka.
- Receiving a message from home.</i>

456
00:35:53,047 --> 00:35:54,765
We'll be right there.

457
00:36:00,927 --> 00:36:02,997
Here, you'll like these pallies.

458
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:05,595
- Here.
- Thank you.

459
00:36:06,727 --> 00:36:08,922
My bones are aching.

460
00:36:09,047 --> 00:36:13,404
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

461
00:36:13,527 --> 00:36:16,246
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

462
00:36:16,367 --> 00:36:18,835
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

463
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:21,242
You'll never reach
the outskirts in time.

464
00:36:21,367 --> 00:36:25,076
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.

465
00:36:25,207 --> 00:36:27,562
Come on.
I'll take you to my place.

466
00:36:41,687 --> 00:36:42,836
Mom!

467
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:46,516
- Mom, I'm home!
- Ah, dissen cosy.

468
00:36:46,647 --> 00:36:48,922
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

469
00:36:49,047 --> 00:36:52,437
- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

470
00:36:52,567 --> 00:36:54,842
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

471
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:56,844
Come on. I'll show you 3PO.

472
00:37:06,247 --> 00:37:09,364
Isn't he great?
He's not finished yet.

473
00:37:09,487 --> 00:37:10,715
He's wonderful.

474
00:37:11,927 --> 00:37:13,565
You really like him?

475
00:37:13,687 --> 00:37:16,485
He's a protocol droid
to help Mom. Watch.

476
00:37:20,727 --> 00:37:21,955
Where is everybody?

477
00:37:22,087 --> 00:37:23,202
Whoops.

478
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:27,402
Oh, hello.

479
00:37:27,527 --> 00:37:30,678
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

480
00:37:30,807 --> 00:37:32,604
How might I serve you?

481
00:37:32,727 --> 00:37:35,400
- He's perfect.
- Oh. Perfect.

482
00:37:35,527 --> 00:37:38,917
When the storm is over, I'll show you
my racer. I'm building a Podracer.

483
00:37:40,247 --> 00:37:42,681
I'm not sure this floor
is entirely stable.

484
00:37:42,807 --> 00:37:45,879
Hello. I don't believe
we have been introduced.

485
00:37:47,727 --> 00:37:49,877
R2-D2.
A pleasure to meet you.

486
00:37:50,007 --> 00:37:52,919
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

487
00:37:55,447 --> 00:37:58,519
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, "naked"?

488
00:38:00,127 --> 00:38:03,244
My parts are showing?
My goodness!

489
00:38:07,687 --> 00:38:10,042
<i>The death toll is catastrophic.</i>

490
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:12,442
<i>We must bow to their wishes.</i>

491
00:38:12,567 --> 00:38:14,523
<i>You must contact me.</i>

492
00:38:14,647 --> 00:38:17,207
It's a trick.
Send no reply.

493
00:38:17,327 --> 00:38:19,238
Send no transmissions of any kind.

494
00:38:21,447 --> 00:38:24,200
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

495
00:38:24,327 --> 00:38:28,115
<i>What if it is true,
and the people are dying?</i>

496
00:38:28,247 --> 00:38:30,602
Either way,
we're running out of time.

497
00:38:43,687 --> 00:38:45,723
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

498
00:38:45,847 --> 00:38:48,520
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

499
00:38:48,647 --> 00:38:50,444
Move against the Jedi first.

500
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:53,161
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo...

501
00:38:53,287 --> 00:38:55,084
to sign the treaty.

502
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:57,277
At last we will reveal ourselves
to the Jedi.

503
00:38:57,407 --> 00:38:59,716
At last we will have revenge.

504
00:38:59,847 --> 00:39:02,600
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

505
00:39:02,727 --> 00:39:05,002
They will be no match for you.

506
00:39:09,687 --> 00:39:13,521
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

507
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:17,445
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

508
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:20,923
- Any attempt to escape-
- And they blow you up!

509
00:39:21,807 --> 00:39:23,320
How wude!

510
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:25,756
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

511
00:39:25,887 --> 00:39:27,684
The Republic's antislavery laws-

512
00:39:27,807 --> 00:39:30,037
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

513
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,237
We must survive on our own.

514
00:39:33,207 --> 00:39:34,640
Xcuse me.

515
00:39:36,647 --> 00:39:39,081
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

516
00:39:39,207 --> 00:39:40,925
They have Podracing
on Malastare.

517
00:39:41,047 --> 00:39:43,641
Very fast, very dangerous.

518
00:39:44,407 --> 00:39:46,204
I'm the only human who can do it.

519
00:39:46,327 --> 00:39:49,205
You must have Jedi reflexes
if you race pods.

520
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:51,606
Don't do that again.

521
00:39:56,847 --> 00:39:59,315
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

522
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:04,920
- What makes you think that?
- I saw your laser sword.

523
00:40:05,047 --> 00:40:07,800
Only Jedis carry
that kind of weapon.

524
00:40:07,927 --> 00:40:10,919
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

525
00:40:11,047 --> 00:40:12,605
I don't think so.

526
00:40:12,727 --> 00:40:14,797
No one can kill a Jedi.

527
00:40:15,607 --> 00:40:17,563
I wish that were so.

528
00:40:17,687 --> 00:40:19,643
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

529
00:40:19,767 --> 00:40:22,804
I came back here
and freed all the slaves.

530
00:40:22,927 --> 00:40:26,124
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

531
00:40:26,247 --> 00:40:30,399
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

532
00:40:35,087 --> 00:40:37,726
I can see there's
no fooling you, Anakin.

533
00:40:37,847 --> 00:40:40,725
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic...

534
00:40:40,847 --> 00:40:42,758
on a very important mission.

535
00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:45,799
How did you end up out here
in the outer rim?

536
00:40:45,927 --> 00:40:49,397
Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.

537
00:40:50,607 --> 00:40:53,679
I can help.
I can fix anything.

538
00:40:53,807 --> 00:40:55,240
I believe you can.

539
00:40:55,367 --> 00:40:58,040
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.

540
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:00,761
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

541
00:41:00,887 --> 00:41:04,277
These junk dealers
must have a weakness of some kind.

542
00:41:04,407 --> 00:41:08,525
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

543
00:41:08,647 --> 00:41:09,841
Podracing.

544
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,765
Greed can be a powerful ally.

545
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,640
I built a racer.
It's the fastest ever.

546
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:17,962
There's a big race tomorrow
on Boonta Eve.

547
00:41:18,087 --> 00:41:19,964
You could enter my pod.

548
00:41:20,887 --> 00:41:23,799
- Anakin, Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

549
00:41:23,927 --> 00:41:25,724
You could make him think
it was yours...

550
00:41:25,847 --> 00:41:27,963
and get him
to let me pilot it for you.

551
00:41:28,087 --> 00:41:29,600
I don't want you to race.
It's awful.

552
00:41:29,727 --> 00:41:32,116
I die every time
Watto makes you do it.

553
00:41:32,247 --> 00:41:34,283
But, Mom, I love it.

554
00:41:34,407 --> 00:41:37,797
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

555
00:41:37,927 --> 00:41:40,122
Anakin.

556
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,886
Your mother's right.

557
00:41:43,007 --> 00:41:45,965
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

558
00:41:47,407 --> 00:41:48,999
No.

559
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:58,324
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

560
00:42:02,967 --> 00:42:05,720
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

561
00:42:05,847 --> 00:42:07,678
We'll find some other way.

562
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:12,402
There is no other way.

563
00:42:12,527 --> 00:42:16,679
I may not like it,
but he can help you.

564
00:42:17,527 --> 00:42:19,324
He was meant to help you.

565
00:42:32,327 --> 00:42:34,124
Are you sure about this?

566
00:42:34,247 --> 00:42:36,761
Trusting our fate
to a boy we hardly know?

567
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,843
The queen will not approve.

568
00:42:38,967 --> 00:42:40,764
The queen doesn't need to know.

569
00:42:41,847 --> 00:42:43,405
Well, I don't approve.

570
00:42:44,487 --> 00:42:47,001
The boy tells me you want
to sponsor him in the race.

571
00:42:47,127 --> 00:42:48,685
How can you do this?

572
00:42:48,807 --> 00:42:51,958
Not on the Republic credits,
I think.

573
00:42:52,087 --> 00:42:54,157
My ship will be the entry fee.

574
00:42:54,647 --> 00:42:56,285
Not bad!

575
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,240
Not bad, huh?
Nubian, huh?

576
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:02,518
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

577
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:05,036
What would the boy ride?

578
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:08,557
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It would take some long time to fix it.

579
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:10,917
It wasn't my fault.
Really.

580
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:12,605
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

581
00:43:12,727 --> 00:43:15,958
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

582
00:43:17,047 --> 00:43:19,402
That you did.

583
00:43:19,527 --> 00:43:22,200
The boy's good.
No doubts there, huh?

584
00:43:22,327 --> 00:43:24,716
I have acquired a pod
in a game of chance.

585
00:43:24,847 --> 00:43:26,439
The fastest ever built.

586
00:43:26,567 --> 00:43:31,482
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

587
00:43:33,367 --> 00:43:36,757
So, you supply the pod
and the entry fee...

588
00:43:36,887 --> 00:43:38,206
and I supply the boy.

589
00:43:38,327 --> 00:43:42,036
We split the winnings 50-50,
I think, huh?

590
00:43:42,167 --> 00:43:43,964
If it's going to be 50-50...

591
00:43:44,087 --> 00:43:46,601
I suggest you front the cash
for the entry.

592
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:48,683
If we win...

593
00:43:48,807 --> 00:43:52,436
<i>you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.</i>

594
00:43:52,567 --> 00:43:55,639
<i>And if we lose,
you keep my ship.</i>

595
00:43:58,007 --> 00:43:59,360
Either way, you win.

596
00:44:04,927 --> 00:44:06,201
Deal!

597
00:44:11,207 --> 00:44:15,280
Your friend
is a foolish one, methinks.

598
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:25,725
What if this plan fails, Master?

599
00:44:25,847 --> 00:44:28,441
We could be stuck here
a very long time.

600
00:44:28,567 --> 00:44:31,001
<i>Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help...</i>

601
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:34,358
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

602
00:44:34,487 --> 00:44:36,364
And...

603
00:44:36,487 --> 00:44:38,284
there's something about this boy.

604
00:44:44,847 --> 00:44:47,077
You should be very proud of your son.

605
00:44:47,807 --> 00:44:50,037
He gives without any thought
of reward.

606
00:44:50,167 --> 00:44:52,920
He knows nothing of greed.

607
00:44:53,047 --> 00:44:54,082
He has-

608
00:44:55,047 --> 00:44:56,844
He has special powers.

609
00:44:58,567 --> 00:44:59,716
Yes.

610
00:44:59,847 --> 00:45:02,361
He can see things
before they happen.

611
00:45:02,487 --> 00:45:05,160
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.

612
00:45:05,287 --> 00:45:07,084
It's a Jedi trait.

613
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:09,880
He deserves better
than a slave's life.

614
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:13,238
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

615
00:45:15,567 --> 00:45:19,162
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

616
00:45:19,287 --> 00:45:20,959
Who was his father?

617
00:45:23,567 --> 00:45:25,398
There was no father.

618
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:30,004
I carried him,
I gave birth, I raised him.

619
00:45:30,847 --> 00:45:33,236
I can't explain what happened.

620
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,565
Can you help him?

621
00:45:36,687 --> 00:45:38,484
I don't know.

622
00:45:40,887 --> 00:45:44,357
I didn't actually come here
to free slaves.

623
00:45:56,967 --> 00:45:58,764
Wow, a real astro droid!

624
00:46:00,607 --> 00:46:04,202
- How do you get so lucky?
- That isn't the half of it.

625
00:46:04,327 --> 00:46:07,160
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
- What?

626
00:46:07,287 --> 00:46:08,925
With this?

627
00:46:09,047 --> 00:46:11,686
You're such a joker, Ani.

628
00:46:11,807 --> 00:46:14,879
- You've been working on that for years.
- It's never gonna run.

629
00:46:15,007 --> 00:46:17,077
Come on.
Let's go and play ball.

630
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:20,358
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

631
00:46:28,567 --> 00:46:30,842
Keep away from
those energy binders.

632
00:46:30,967 --> 00:46:34,277
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

633
00:46:34,407 --> 00:46:35,726
Okay.

634
00:46:39,287 --> 00:46:41,721
My tongue is fat.

635
00:46:41,847 --> 00:46:44,805
My tongue- Wrench.

636
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:47,487
Where is de wrench?
Oh, dare it is.

637
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,246
I'm stuck.

638
00:46:53,367 --> 00:46:57,201
You know, I find that Jar Jar creature
to be a little odd.

639
00:46:58,967 --> 00:47:01,686
You don't even know
if this thing's gonna run.

640
00:47:01,807 --> 00:47:03,798
- It will.
- I think it's time we found out.

641
00:47:03,927 --> 00:47:06,043
- Here, use this power charge.
- Yes, sir!

642
00:47:06,167 --> 00:47:08,123
Come on, Kitster.
Let's move away.

643
00:47:08,247 --> 00:47:10,363
My mouth.

644
00:47:10,487 --> 00:47:11,761
Ani, I'm stuck.

645
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:18,837
My tongue is fat.

646
00:47:18,967 --> 00:47:21,800
You're quite right.
He's very odd indeed.

647
00:47:23,927 --> 00:47:25,883
Thank you.

648
00:47:26,007 --> 00:47:27,360
Go.

649
00:47:41,287 --> 00:47:44,757
It's working!
It's working!

650
00:47:54,967 --> 00:47:57,356
Stay still, Ani.
Let me clean this cut.

651
00:47:57,487 --> 00:48:01,241
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

652
00:48:01,367 --> 00:48:03,164
Most of them.

653
00:48:03,287 --> 00:48:05,164
Has anyone been to 'em all?

654
00:48:06,807 --> 00:48:07,956
Not likely.

655
00:48:09,047 --> 00:48:11,163
I wanna be the first one
to see 'em all.

656
00:48:12,327 --> 00:48:14,602
Ani, bedtime!

657
00:48:14,727 --> 00:48:17,366
There we are.
Good as new.

658
00:48:17,487 --> 00:48:20,240
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

659
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:23,643
- What are you doing?
- Checking your blood for infections.

660
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:25,246
Go on.

661
00:48:25,367 --> 00:48:27,244
You have a big day tomorrow.

662
00:48:27,367 --> 00:48:29,164
Sleep well, Ani.

663
00:48:31,807 --> 00:48:33,718
<i>- Obi-Wan?
- Yes, Master?</i>

664
00:48:33,847 --> 00:48:36,441
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.

665
00:48:36,567 --> 00:48:38,205
Wait a minute.

666
00:48:39,847 --> 00:48:41,724
I need a midi-chlorian count.

667
00:48:44,567 --> 00:48:47,081
The reading is off the chart.

668
00:48:47,207 --> 00:48:49,004
Over 20,000.

669
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:52,597
<i>Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high.</i>

670
00:48:52,727 --> 00:48:54,445
No Jedi has.

671
00:48:54,567 --> 00:48:56,523
What does that mean?

672
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:58,925
I'm not sure.

673
00:50:06,007 --> 00:50:08,760
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

674
00:50:08,887 --> 00:50:10,559
Patience, my blue friend.

675
00:50:10,687 --> 00:50:12,837
You'll have your winnings
before the suns set.

676
00:50:12,967 --> 00:50:14,685
And we'll be far away from here.

677
00:50:14,807 --> 00:50:18,686
Not if your ship belongs to me,
I think, huh?

678
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:22,038
I warn you, no funny business.

679
00:50:22,167 --> 00:50:25,159
- You don't think Anakin can win?
- Don't get me wrongo.

680
00:50:25,287 --> 00:50:27,642
I have great faith in the boy.

681
00:50:27,767 --> 00:50:29,803
He's a credit to your race...

682
00:50:29,927 --> 00:50:32,999
but Sebulba there
is going to win, I think.

683
00:50:35,047 --> 00:50:36,719
Oh, no!

684
00:50:40,727 --> 00:50:42,479
Why do you think that?

685
00:50:42,607 --> 00:50:44,404
He always wins!

686
00:50:46,327 --> 00:50:48,682
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

687
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:53,041
- I'll take that bet.
- What?

688
00:50:53,767 --> 00:50:56,964
I'll wager my new racing pod
against, say...

689
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:58,884
the boy and his mother.

690
00:50:59,007 --> 00:51:02,556
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

691
00:51:03,447 --> 00:51:05,119
The boy, then.

692
00:51:11,087 --> 00:51:13,476
We'll let fate decide, huh?

693
00:51:13,607 --> 00:51:16,883
I just happen to have
a chance cube here.

694
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:19,919
Blue, it's the boy.

695
00:51:20,047 --> 00:51:21,116
Red...

696
00:51:22,487 --> 00:51:24,045
his mother.

697
00:51:33,367 --> 00:51:35,676
You won this small toss,
outlander...

698
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,843
but you won't win the race!

699
00:51:37,967 --> 00:51:39,958
So it makes little difference!

700
00:51:49,367 --> 00:51:54,077
Better stop your friend's betting
or I'll end up owning him too.

701
00:51:57,687 --> 00:52:00,076
- What'd he mean by that?
- I'll tell you later.

702
00:52:00,207 --> 00:52:01,526
Good morning.

703
00:52:03,567 --> 00:52:06,206
Oh, my.
Space travel sounds rather perilous.

704
00:52:08,207 --> 00:52:12,041
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.

705
00:52:12,167 --> 00:52:15,398
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

706
00:52:15,527 --> 00:52:16,562
Do what?

707
00:52:16,687 --> 00:52:19,599
Finish the race, of course.

708
00:52:19,727 --> 00:52:21,399
You've never won a race?

709
00:52:21,527 --> 00:52:24,121
Well, not exactly.

710
00:52:24,247 --> 00:52:26,158
Not even finished?

711
00:52:26,287 --> 00:52:28,642
Kitster's right.
I will this time.

712
00:52:28,767 --> 00:52:30,723
Of course you will.

713
00:52:59,167 --> 00:53:00,919
That's absolutely right.

714
00:53:01,047 --> 00:53:05,882
And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.

715
00:53:06,007 --> 00:53:09,477
I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.

716
00:53:11,487 --> 00:53:14,206
<i>I see Ben Quadinaros
from the Tund System.</i>

717
00:53:19,647 --> 00:53:22,002
<i>Two-time winner Boles Roor.</i>

718
00:53:24,447 --> 00:53:26,165
<i>Sebulba!</i>

719
00:53:36,167 --> 00:53:39,125
And in the front row,
nearside pole position...

720
00:53:39,247 --> 00:53:41,158
<i>Mawhonic!</i>

721
00:53:42,327 --> 00:53:44,283
<i>A hearty hello...</i>

722
00:53:44,407 --> 00:53:47,956
<i>to Clegg Holdfast
and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!</i>

723
00:53:50,847 --> 00:53:53,725
<i>And back again,
it's the mighty Dud Bolt...</i>

724
00:53:53,847 --> 00:53:58,238
<i>with that incredible racing machine,
the Vulptereen 327.</i>

725
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:03,642
<i>And hoping for a big win today...</i>

726
00:54:03,767 --> 00:54:07,999
<i>Ody Mandrell,
with his record-setting pit droid team.</i>

727
00:54:12,687 --> 00:54:15,804
<i>And a late entry,
young Anakin Skywalker...</i>

728
00:54:15,927 --> 00:54:17,155
<i>a local boy.</i>

729
00:54:19,767 --> 00:54:21,917
I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.

730
00:54:41,327 --> 00:54:42,806
Be safe.

731
00:54:42,927 --> 00:54:45,157
I will, Mom. I promise.

732
00:55:00,687 --> 00:55:03,247
You won't walk away from this one...

733
00:55:03,367 --> 00:55:05,517
<i>you slave scum.</i>

734
00:55:05,647 --> 00:55:08,764
Don't count on it, slime ball.

735
00:55:08,887 --> 00:55:11,162
You're bantha fodder!

736
00:55:15,567 --> 00:55:17,683
- You all set, Ani?
- Yep.

737
00:55:17,807 --> 00:55:19,365
Right.

738
00:55:23,327 --> 00:55:25,841
Remember, concentrate
on the moment.

739
00:55:25,967 --> 00:55:29,562
Feel, don't think.
Use your instincts.

740
00:55:29,687 --> 00:55:31,245
I will.

741
00:55:31,367 --> 00:55:33,483
May the Force be with you.

742
00:55:42,087 --> 00:55:43,998
Jabba the Hutt.

743
00:55:53,807 --> 00:55:58,039
Welcome.

744
00:55:58,967 --> 00:56:02,084
Begin the race!

745
00:56:12,207 --> 00:56:15,244
<i>Hey, looks like
they're clearing the grid.</i>

746
00:56:16,407 --> 00:56:18,204
- Is he nervous?
- He's fine.

747
00:56:19,767 --> 00:56:22,520
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not-

748
00:56:22,647 --> 00:56:25,400
<i>The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.</i>

749
00:56:25,527 --> 00:56:27,643
You should too.

750
00:56:27,767 --> 00:56:29,758
You assume too much.

751
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:32,796
<i>Start your engines.</i>

752
00:57:10,487 --> 00:57:13,684
Oh, dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!

753
00:57:32,887 --> 00:57:34,115
Oh, no!

754
00:57:39,527 --> 00:57:42,678
Wait.
Little Skywalker has stalled.

755
00:57:52,727 --> 00:57:56,766
<i>It looks like Quadinaros
is having engine trouble also.</i>

756
00:57:58,287 --> 00:57:59,515
Come on, Ani!

757
00:58:05,687 --> 00:58:07,200
<i>And there goes Skywalker!</i>

758
00:58:07,327 --> 00:58:08,726
Go, Ani, go!

759
00:58:08,847 --> 00:58:10,883
<i>He will be hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.</i>

760
00:59:21,967 --> 00:59:24,765
<i>Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are camped out...</i>

761
00:59:24,887 --> 00:59:27,082
<i>on the canyon dune turn.</i>

762
00:59:37,847 --> 00:59:41,396
There goes Quadinaros'
power coupling.

763
01:00:08,007 --> 01:00:10,123
Oh, no!

764
01:00:14,727 --> 01:00:16,524
Where is Master Anakin?

765
01:00:19,647 --> 01:00:21,763
Look. Here he comes.

766
01:00:24,527 --> 01:00:26,757
<i>It looks like Skywalker
is moving up in the field.</i>

767
01:00:27,607 --> 01:00:28,960
Yay! Yippee!

768
01:00:36,167 --> 01:00:39,603
He has to complete
two more circuits? Oh, dear.

769
01:01:44,447 --> 01:01:46,244
Skywalker's
spinning out of control!

770
01:02:41,807 --> 01:02:45,595
I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!

771
01:02:52,367 --> 01:02:54,005
Here he comes!

772
01:02:54,127 --> 01:02:57,119
<i>At the start of the third and final lap,
Sebulba's in the lead...</i>

773
01:02:57,247 --> 01:02:59,636
<i>followed closely by Skywalker!</i>

774
01:02:59,767 --> 01:03:00,597
Go, Ani!

775
01:03:26,527 --> 01:03:28,757
Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!

776
01:03:49,567 --> 01:03:50,886
It's Skywalker!

777
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:53,081
Sebulba!

778
01:03:53,207 --> 01:03:57,280
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!

779
01:03:57,407 --> 01:03:59,079
Did he crash-ed?

780
01:04:38,367 --> 01:04:41,439
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!

781
01:05:32,287 --> 01:05:33,879
He's catching Sebulba!

782
01:05:34,967 --> 01:05:37,356
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

783
01:06:06,487 --> 01:06:08,762
That little human being
is out of his mind!

784
01:06:09,847 --> 01:06:10,962
<i>They're side by side!</i>

785
01:06:38,447 --> 01:06:40,244
- Yippee!
- Yay!

786
01:06:44,287 --> 01:06:45,925
I can't believe it.

787
01:06:46,047 --> 01:06:47,878
The crowds are going nuts!

788
01:06:56,447 --> 01:06:58,403
Yay, Ani!

789
01:06:59,687 --> 01:07:02,599
Mom, I did it! Yay!

790
01:07:12,687 --> 01:07:14,484
Good going, Ani!

791
01:07:18,687 --> 01:07:20,564
We owe you everything, Ani.

792
01:07:23,087 --> 01:07:25,123
It's so wonderful, Ani.

793
01:07:25,247 --> 01:07:27,841
You have brought hope
to those who have none.

794
01:07:27,967 --> 01:07:30,083
I'm so very proud of you.

795
01:07:40,127 --> 01:07:41,924
You!

796
01:07:42,047 --> 01:07:44,242
You swindled me.

797
01:07:44,367 --> 01:07:47,996
You knew the boy was going to win.
Somehow you knew it.

798
01:07:48,127 --> 01:07:49,924
I lost everything.

799
01:07:50,047 --> 01:07:53,437
Whenever you gamble, my friend,
eventually you lose.

800
01:07:53,567 --> 01:07:55,922
Bring the parts
to the main hangar.

801
01:07:56,047 --> 01:07:59,005
I'll come by your shop later on
so you can release the boy.

802
01:07:59,127 --> 01:08:02,278
You can't have him.
It wasn't a fair bet.

803
01:08:04,927 --> 01:08:08,237
Would you like to discuss it
with the Hutts?

804
01:08:08,367 --> 01:08:10,756
I'm sure they can settle this.

805
01:08:12,207 --> 01:08:14,004
Take him.

806
01:08:20,687 --> 01:08:21,676
Hidoe!

807
01:08:23,247 --> 01:08:25,238
Well, we have all
the essential parts we need.

808
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:26,356
I'm going back.

809
01:08:26,487 --> 01:08:28,478
Some unfinished business.
I won't be long.

810
01:08:28,607 --> 01:08:31,917
Why do I sense we've picked up
another pathetic life-form?

811
01:08:32,687 --> 01:08:35,679
It's the boy who's responsible
for getting us these parts.

812
01:08:35,807 --> 01:08:37,604
Get this hyperdrive
generator installed.

813
01:08:37,727 --> 01:08:40,161
Yes, Master.
That shouldn't take long.

814
01:08:40,287 --> 01:08:42,357
Come on. Hup!

815
01:08:46,807 --> 01:08:48,604
Hey. These are yours.

816
01:08:50,527 --> 01:08:51,721
Yes!

817
01:08:53,207 --> 01:08:55,846
Mom, we sold the pod!
Look at all the money we have!

818
01:08:55,967 --> 01:08:58,242
My goodness!
But that's so wonderful, Ani.

819
01:08:58,367 --> 01:09:01,200
- And he has been freed.
- What?

820
01:09:01,327 --> 01:09:03,045
You're no longer a slave.

821
01:09:04,887 --> 01:09:06,718
Did you hear that?

822
01:09:07,487 --> 01:09:09,842
<i>Now you can make
your dreams come true, Ani.</i>

823
01:09:10,687 --> 01:09:12,518
You are free.

824
01:09:15,967 --> 01:09:17,366
Will you take him with you?

825
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:19,045
Is he to become a Jedi?

826
01:09:19,167 --> 01:09:21,601
Yes. Our meeting
was not a coincidence.

827
01:09:22,407 --> 01:09:23,999
Nothing happens by accident.

828
01:09:24,127 --> 01:09:27,517
You mean I get to come with you
in your starship?

829
01:09:27,647 --> 01:09:29,000
Anakin...

830
01:09:30,847 --> 01:09:33,998
training to become a Jedi
is not an easy challenge...

831
01:09:34,127 --> 01:09:36,880
and even if you succeed,
it's a hard life.

832
01:09:37,007 --> 01:09:40,044
But I wanna go. It's what
I've always dreamed of doing.

833
01:09:40,847 --> 01:09:42,883
Can I go, Mom?

834
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:45,399
Anakin...

835
01:09:45,527 --> 01:09:48,325
this path has been placed
before you.

836
01:09:48,447 --> 01:09:50,802
The choice is yours alone.

837
01:09:54,327 --> 01:09:56,124
I wanna do it.

838
01:09:58,607 --> 01:10:00,723
Then pack your things.
We haven't much time.

839
01:10:07,087 --> 01:10:08,600
What about Mom?

840
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:13,404
Is she free too?

841
01:10:13,527 --> 01:10:16,883
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.

842
01:10:17,887 --> 01:10:19,764
You're coming with us,
aren't you, Mom?

843
01:10:27,447 --> 01:10:30,644
Son, my place is here.
My future is here.

844
01:10:30,767 --> 01:10:33,042
It is time for you to let go.

845
01:10:34,127 --> 01:10:36,163
I don't want things to change.

846
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:38,562
But you can't stop the change...

847
01:10:38,687 --> 01:10:41,645
any more than you can
stop the suns from setting.

848
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:44,518
I love you.

849
01:10:49,967 --> 01:10:51,764
Now hurry.

850
01:10:57,087 --> 01:10:58,406
Thank you.

851
01:10:58,527 --> 01:11:01,325
I'll watch after him.
You have my word.

852
01:11:03,487 --> 01:11:04,920
Will you be all right?

853
01:11:06,327 --> 01:11:07,726
Yeah.

854
01:11:12,567 --> 01:11:14,080
Hello, Master Anakin.

855
01:11:14,207 --> 01:11:16,198
Well, 3PO, I've been freed...

856
01:11:16,327 --> 01:11:18,602
and I'm going away in a starship.

857
01:11:18,727 --> 01:11:21,525
Master Anakin, you are my maker
and I wish you well.

858
01:11:21,647 --> 01:11:25,686
However, I should prefer it
if I were a little more completed.

859
01:11:25,807 --> 01:11:28,799
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to finish you, 3PO...

860
01:11:28,927 --> 01:11:30,883
give you coverings and all.

861
01:11:31,007 --> 01:11:32,565
I'm gonna miss working on you.

862
01:11:32,687 --> 01:11:35,042
You've been a great pal.

863
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:37,681
I'll make sure Mom
doesn't sell you or anything.

864
01:11:38,447 --> 01:11:39,436
Sell me?

865
01:11:39,567 --> 01:11:41,125
Bye.

866
01:11:41,247 --> 01:11:42,566
Oh, my.

867
01:12:06,207 --> 01:12:08,323
I can't do it, Mom.
I just can't do it.

868
01:12:12,447 --> 01:12:14,358
Will I ever see you again?

869
01:12:15,767 --> 01:12:18,520
What does your heart tell you?

870
01:12:19,807 --> 01:12:21,638
I hope so.

871
01:12:22,367 --> 01:12:24,164
Yes.

872
01:12:24,287 --> 01:12:25,800
I guess.

873
01:12:26,807 --> 01:12:29,275
Then we will
see each other again.

874
01:12:31,887 --> 01:12:34,560
I will come back
and free you, Mom.

875
01:12:34,687 --> 01:12:36,325
I promise.

876
01:12:44,247 --> 01:12:47,080
Now, be brave...

877
01:12:47,847 --> 01:12:49,758
and don't look back.

878
01:12:50,527 --> 01:12:52,324
Don't look back.

879
01:13:35,087 --> 01:13:36,122
Qui-Gon, sir, wait!

880
01:13:36,247 --> 01:13:37,919
- I'm tired!
- Anakin! Drop!

881
01:13:40,287 --> 01:13:41,197
Go!

882
01:13:42,207 --> 01:13:44,038
Tell them to take off!

883
01:13:56,127 --> 01:13:57,526
Qui-Gon's in trouble.

884
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:00,086
Take off.

885
01:14:00,767 --> 01:14:02,439
Over there. Fly low.

886
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:26,045
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

887
01:14:26,167 --> 01:14:27,646
What was it?

888
01:14:27,767 --> 01:14:29,439
I'm not sure...

889
01:14:29,567 --> 01:14:32,001
but it was well-trained
in the Jedi arts.

890
01:14:32,247 --> 01:14:34,522
My guess is
it was after the queen.

891
01:14:34,647 --> 01:14:37,036
What are we gonna do about it?

892
01:14:38,927 --> 01:14:40,485
We shall be patient.

893
01:14:40,607 --> 01:14:41,676
Anakin Skywalker...

894
01:14:41,807 --> 01:14:43,525
meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

895
01:14:45,847 --> 01:14:48,281
You're a Jedi too?
Pleased to meet you.

896
01:14:56,887 --> 01:14:59,321
<i>Your queen is lost,
your people are starving...</i>

897
01:14:59,447 --> 01:15:01,358
and you, Governor,
are going to die...

898
01:15:01,487 --> 01:15:03,523
much sooner than your people,
I'm afraid.

899
01:15:03,647 --> 01:15:06,036
This invasion
will gain you nothing.

900
01:15:06,167 --> 01:15:09,045
We're a democracy.
The people have decided.

901
01:15:09,167 --> 01:15:10,964
Take him away.

902
01:15:14,287 --> 01:15:16,642
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps...

903
01:15:16,767 --> 01:15:19,201
for these rumoured
underwater villages.

904
01:15:19,327 --> 01:15:21,841
They will not
stay hidden for long.

905
01:15:32,447 --> 01:15:35,041
<i>The death toll is catastrophic.</i>

906
01:15:35,167 --> 01:15:37,681
<i>We must bow to their wishes.</i>

907
01:15:37,807 --> 01:15:39,923
<i>You must contact me.</i>

908
01:15:53,487 --> 01:15:55,318
You all right?

909
01:15:56,327 --> 01:15:58,158
It's very cold.

910
01:16:05,807 --> 01:16:08,446
You come from
a warm planet, Ani.

911
01:16:08,567 --> 01:16:10,842
A little too warm
for my taste.

912
01:16:10,967 --> 01:16:13,117
Space is cold.

913
01:16:13,247 --> 01:16:15,283
You seem sad.

914
01:16:16,407 --> 01:16:18,557
The queen is worried.

915
01:16:18,687 --> 01:16:20,996
Her people are suffering, dying.

916
01:16:21,127 --> 01:16:24,483
She must convince the senate
to intervene or...

917
01:16:25,887 --> 01:16:28,082
I'm not sure what'll happen.

918
01:16:29,487 --> 01:16:31,443
I made this for you...

919
01:16:32,887 --> 01:16:34,684
so you'd remember me.

920
01:16:35,367 --> 01:16:37,927
I carved it
out of a japor snippet.

921
01:16:38,047 --> 01:16:40,766
It'll bring you good fortune.

922
01:16:40,887 --> 01:16:42,684
It's beautiful.

923
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:45,082
But I don't need this
to remember you by.

924
01:16:48,607 --> 01:16:51,838
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani...

925
01:16:51,967 --> 01:16:54,401
but my caring for you will remain.

926
01:16:57,007 --> 01:16:59,999
I care for you, too, only I-

927
01:17:00,127 --> 01:17:02,197
Miss your mother.

928
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:23,920
Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.

929
01:17:24,047 --> 01:17:25,719
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.

930
01:17:25,847 --> 01:17:28,964
And look over there.
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.

931
01:17:57,247 --> 01:18:00,159
It is a great gift
to see you alive, Your Majesty.

932
01:18:00,287 --> 01:18:03,120
With the communications breakdown,
we've been very concerned.

933
01:18:03,247 --> 01:18:05,602
I'm anxious to hear your report
on the situation.

934
01:18:05,727 --> 01:18:08,241
May I present
Supreme Chancellor Valorum.

935
01:18:08,367 --> 01:18:10,244
Welcome, Your Highness.

936
01:18:10,367 --> 01:18:12,323
It's an honour to finally
meet you in person.

937
01:18:12,447 --> 01:18:13,846
Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.

938
01:18:13,967 --> 01:18:17,323
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.

939
01:18:17,447 --> 01:18:20,723
I've called for a special session
of the senate to hear your position.

940
01:18:21,847 --> 01:18:24,805
I'm grateful for your concern,
Chancellor.

941
01:18:24,927 --> 01:18:26,724
There is a question
of procedure...

942
01:18:26,847 --> 01:18:29,236
but I'm confident
we can overcome it.

943
01:18:30,047 --> 01:18:32,117
I must speak with the Jedi Council
immediately.

944
01:18:32,247 --> 01:18:34,920
The situation has become
much more complicated.

945
01:18:40,447 --> 01:18:42,278
Ani, come on.

946
01:18:53,047 --> 01:18:55,641
Da queen's a bein grossly nice,
mesa tinks.

947
01:18:56,927 --> 01:18:58,804
Pitty hot.

948
01:19:25,567 --> 01:19:28,559
There is no civility,
only politics.

949
01:19:29,807 --> 01:19:33,516
The Republic
is not what it once was.

950
01:19:33,647 --> 01:19:38,675
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.

951
01:19:39,447 --> 01:19:42,723
There is no interest
in the common good.

952
01:19:43,567 --> 01:19:45,125
I must be frank, Your Majesty.

953
01:19:45,247 --> 01:19:47,841
There is little chance the senate
will act on the invasion.

954
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:50,561
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.

955
01:19:50,687 --> 01:19:52,484
If I may say so, Your Majesty...

956
01:19:52,607 --> 01:19:54,723
the chancellor
has little real power.

957
01:19:54,847 --> 01:19:58,556
He is mired by baseless
accusations of corruption.

958
01:19:58,687 --> 01:20:02,282
- The bureaucrats are in charge now.
- What options have we?

959
01:20:03,007 --> 01:20:05,760
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...

960
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:08,003
of a stronger
supreme chancellor...

961
01:20:08,127 --> 01:20:10,197
one who could control
the bureaucrats...

962
01:20:10,327 --> 01:20:12,079
and give us justice.

963
01:20:12,927 --> 01:20:18,206
You could call for a vote of
no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.

964
01:20:18,327 --> 01:20:20,716
He has been
our strongest supporter.

965
01:20:20,847 --> 01:20:25,841
Our only other choice would be
to submit a plea to the courts.

966
01:20:25,967 --> 01:20:29,164
The courts take even longer
to decide things than the senate.

967
01:20:30,047 --> 01:20:32,038
Our people are dying, Senator.

968
01:20:32,807 --> 01:20:35,685
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

969
01:20:35,807 --> 01:20:38,196
To be realistic, Your Majesty...

970
01:20:38,327 --> 01:20:40,716
I think we're going to have to
accept Federation control...

971
01:20:40,847 --> 01:20:43,236
for the time being.

972
01:20:44,927 --> 01:20:46,918
That is something I cannot do.

973
01:20:53,967 --> 01:20:56,435
He was trained in the Jedi arts.

974
01:20:56,567 --> 01:21:00,321
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord.

975
01:21:00,447 --> 01:21:01,766
Impossible.

976
01:21:01,887 --> 01:21:04,447
The Sith have been extinct
for a millennium.

977
01:21:04,567 --> 01:21:08,560
I do not believe the Sith could
have returned without us knowing.

978
01:21:09,527 --> 01:21:11,643
Hard to see,
the dark side is.

979
01:21:11,767 --> 01:21:14,520
We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.

980
01:21:14,647 --> 01:21:17,719
We will discover the identity
of your attacker.

981
01:21:17,847 --> 01:21:19,439
May the Force be with you.

982
01:21:23,327 --> 01:21:24,726
Master Qui-Gon.

983
01:21:25,567 --> 01:21:27,285
More to say have you?

984
01:21:29,327 --> 01:21:31,124
With your permission, my master...

985
01:21:32,607 --> 01:21:35,485
I have encountered
a vergence in the Force.

986
01:21:36,567 --> 01:21:38,478
A vergence, you say.

987
01:21:38,607 --> 01:21:40,643
Located around a person?

988
01:21:40,767 --> 01:21:41,961
A boy.

989
01:21:42,087 --> 01:21:44,476
His cells have the highest
concentration of midi-chlorians...

990
01:21:44,607 --> 01:21:46,325
I have seen in a life-form.

991
01:21:46,447 --> 01:21:49,200
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

992
01:21:50,847 --> 01:21:54,556
You refer to the prophecy of the one
who will bring balance to the Force.

993
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:57,363
You believe it's this boy?

994
01:21:57,487 --> 01:21:59,955
- I don't presume to-
- But you do.

995
01:22:00,687 --> 01:22:02,564
Revealed your opinion is.

996
01:22:02,687 --> 01:22:04,643
I request the boy be tested,
Master.

997
01:22:06,687 --> 01:22:09,759
<i>Trained as a Jedi
you request for him, hmm?</i>

998
01:22:09,887 --> 01:22:12,162
Finding him
was the will of the Force.

999
01:22:12,287 --> 01:22:14,437
I have no doubt of that.

1000
01:22:20,847 --> 01:22:22,803
Bring him before us, then.

1001
01:22:33,447 --> 01:22:35,244
The boy's here to see Padm¨¦.

1002
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:36,880
<i>Let him in.</i>

1003
01:22:39,967 --> 01:22:43,676
I'm sorry, Ani, but Padm¨¦'s
not here right now.

1004
01:22:43,807 --> 01:22:45,399
Who is it?

1005
01:22:46,167 --> 01:22:49,045
Anakin Skywalker to see Padm¨¦,
Your Highness.

1006
01:22:49,167 --> 01:22:50,885
I've sent Padm¨¦ on an errand.

1007
01:22:51,007 --> 01:22:52,804
I'm on my way
to the Jedi temple...

1008
01:22:52,927 --> 01:22:55,077
to start my training, I hope.

1009
01:22:55,887 --> 01:22:59,562
I may never see her again,
so I came to say goodbye.

1010
01:23:00,607 --> 01:23:04,077
We will tell her for you.
We are sure her heart goes with you.

1011
01:23:05,167 --> 01:23:06,156
Thank you, Your Highness.

1012
01:23:19,607 --> 01:23:23,520
The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.

1013
01:23:30,047 --> 01:23:33,278
Supreme Chancellor,
delegates of the senate...

1014
01:23:34,367 --> 01:23:36,642
a tragedy has occurred...

1015
01:23:36,767 --> 01:23:40,123
which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes...

1016
01:23:40,247 --> 01:23:43,125
and has now engulfed
our entire planet...

1017
01:23:43,247 --> 01:23:45,158
in the oppression
of the Trade Federation.

1018
01:23:46,007 --> 01:23:47,360
This is outrageous!

1019
01:23:47,487 --> 01:23:49,921
I object
to the senator's statements.

1020
01:23:50,047 --> 01:23:53,926
The chair does not recognize the senator
from the Trade Federation at this time.

1021
01:23:54,047 --> 01:23:57,756
To state our allegations,
I present Queen Amidala...

1022
01:23:57,887 --> 01:23:59,798
recently elected
ruler of the Naboo...

1023
01:23:59,927 --> 01:24:01,724
who speaks on our behalf.

1024
01:24:07,487 --> 01:24:10,126
Honourable representatives
of the Republic...

1025
01:24:10,847 --> 01:24:13,202
I come to you under the gravest
of circumstances.

1026
01:24:13,327 --> 01:24:16,080
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade-

1027
01:24:16,207 --> 01:24:19,597
I object!
There is no proof!

1028
01:24:19,727 --> 01:24:21,524
This is incredible.

1029
01:24:21,647 --> 01:24:25,435
We recommend a commission be sent
to Naboo to ascertain the truth.

1030
01:24:25,567 --> 01:24:26,795
The Congress of Malastare...

1031
01:24:26,927 --> 01:24:29,805
concurs with the honourable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

1032
01:24:29,927 --> 01:24:31,883
A commission must be appointed.

1033
01:24:32,007 --> 01:24:34,396
- The point-
- Excuse me, Chancellor.

1034
01:24:34,527 --> 01:24:36,085
Enter the bureaucrat.

1035
01:24:36,207 --> 01:24:38,721
The true rulers of the Republic.

1036
01:24:38,847 --> 01:24:42,840
And on the payroll
of the Trade Federation, I might add.

1037
01:24:42,967 --> 01:24:47,006
This is where Chancellor Valorum's
strength will disappear.

1038
01:24:48,527 --> 01:24:50,722
The point is conceded.

1039
01:24:50,847 --> 01:24:53,361
Will you defer your motion
to allow a commission...

1040
01:24:53,487 --> 01:24:56,160
to explore the validity
of your accusations?

1041
01:24:56,287 --> 01:24:58,084
I will not defer.

1042
01:24:58,207 --> 01:25:01,563
I've come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now.

1043
01:25:01,687 --> 01:25:04,565
I was not elected to watch
my people suffer and die...

1044
01:25:04,687 --> 01:25:07,247
while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.

1045
01:25:10,087 --> 01:25:12,317
If this body
is not capable of action...

1046
01:25:12,447 --> 01:25:14,403
I suggest new leadership is needed.

1047
01:25:17,687 --> 01:25:19,803
I move for a vote
of no confidence...

1048
01:25:19,927 --> 01:25:21,838
in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

1049
01:25:28,607 --> 01:25:30,677
Vote now! Vote now!

1050
01:25:34,327 --> 01:25:36,158
Order!

1051
01:25:36,287 --> 01:25:39,040
Now they will elect
a new chancellor...

1052
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:40,964
a strong chancellor...

1053
01:25:41,087 --> 01:25:43,885
one who will not
let our tragedy continue.

1054
01:25:45,527 --> 01:25:49,600
The boy will not pass the council's
test, Master. He's too old.

1055
01:25:49,727 --> 01:25:52,719
Anakin will become a Jedi,
I promise you.

1056
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:55,441
Do not defy the council,
Master, not again.

1057
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:58,161
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.

1058
01:26:00,007 --> 01:26:03,602
<i>If you would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.</i>

1059
01:26:03,727 --> 01:26:05,683
They will not go along
with you this time.

1060
01:26:07,127 --> 01:26:09,595
You still have much to learn,
my young apprentice.

1061
01:26:12,767 --> 01:26:14,086
A ship.

1062
01:26:15,647 --> 01:26:17,524
A cup.

1063
01:26:17,647 --> 01:26:19,365
A ship.

1064
01:26:20,447 --> 01:26:21,846
A speeder.

1065
01:26:29,087 --> 01:26:30,918
How feel you?

1066
01:26:31,487 --> 01:26:33,079
Cold, sir.

1067
01:26:34,687 --> 01:26:36,757
- Afraid are you?
- No, sir.

1068
01:26:37,887 --> 01:26:40,401
See through you we can.

1069
01:26:40,527 --> 01:26:42,324
Be mindful of your feelings.

1070
01:26:42,447 --> 01:26:45,086
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.

1071
01:26:46,687 --> 01:26:48,040
I miss her.

1072
01:26:49,247 --> 01:26:51,602
Afraid to lose her,
I think, mmm?

1073
01:26:51,727 --> 01:26:53,763
What has that got to do
with anything?

1074
01:26:53,887 --> 01:26:56,117
Everything.

1075
01:26:56,247 --> 01:26:59,159
Fear is the path to the dark side.

1076
01:26:59,287 --> 01:27:02,040
Fear leads to anger.
Anger leads to hate.

1077
01:27:02,167 --> 01:27:05,364
Hate leads to suffering.

1078
01:27:11,647 --> 01:27:14,445
I sense much fear in you.

1079
01:27:26,847 --> 01:27:30,078
<i>Yousa tinking
yousa people ganna die?</i>

1080
01:27:30,207 --> 01:27:31,481
I don't know.

1081
01:27:32,767 --> 01:27:34,564
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

1082
01:27:36,927 --> 01:27:38,883
I hope not.

1083
01:27:39,647 --> 01:27:41,763
Gungans no die'n without a fight.

1084
01:27:41,887 --> 01:27:43,684
Wesa warriors.

1085
01:27:43,807 --> 01:27:46,924
Wesa got a grand army.

1086
01:27:47,047 --> 01:27:50,119
Dat's why you no liken us,
mesa tinks.

1087
01:27:50,247 --> 01:27:51,521
Your Highness?

1088
01:27:54,087 --> 01:27:56,123
Your Highness...

1089
01:27:56,247 --> 01:27:59,205
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum...

1090
01:27:59,327 --> 01:28:00,646
as supreme chancellor.

1091
01:28:00,767 --> 01:28:04,476
A surprise, to be sure,
but a welcome one.

1092
01:28:04,607 --> 01:28:08,805
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

1093
01:28:08,927 --> 01:28:10,519
Who else has been nominated?

1094
01:28:10,647 --> 01:28:14,765
Bail Antilles of Alderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

1095
01:28:14,887 --> 01:28:19,597
I feel confident our situation will
create a strong sympathy vote for us.

1096
01:28:21,247 --> 01:28:23,158
I will be chancellor.

1097
01:28:23,287 --> 01:28:25,755
I fear by the time you have control
of the bureaucrats, Senator...

1098
01:28:25,887 --> 01:28:28,959
there'll be nothing left
of our people, our way of life.

1099
01:28:29,087 --> 01:28:30,884
I understand your concern,
Your Majesty.

1100
01:28:31,007 --> 01:28:34,397
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.

1101
01:28:36,127 --> 01:28:39,756
Senator, this is your arena.

1102
01:28:40,127 --> 01:28:41,958
I feel I must return to mine.

1103
01:28:45,087 --> 01:28:47,282
I've decided to go back to Naboo.

1104
01:28:47,407 --> 01:28:48,237
Go back?

1105
01:28:48,367 --> 01:28:51,200
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.
They'll force you to sign the treaty.

1106
01:28:51,327 --> 01:28:53,602
I will sign no treaty, Senator.

1107
01:28:53,727 --> 01:28:56,400
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

1108
01:28:56,527 --> 01:28:58,040
- Captain.
- Your Highness.

1109
01:28:58,167 --> 01:29:00,362
- Ready my ship.
- Please, Your Majesty.

1110
01:29:00,487 --> 01:29:02,284
Stay here where it's safe.

1111
01:29:03,727 --> 01:29:06,764
It is clear to me now that
the Republic no longer functions.

1112
01:29:07,487 --> 01:29:11,446
I pray you will bring sanity
and compassion back to the senate.

1113
01:29:20,767 --> 01:29:23,235
The Force is strong with him.

1114
01:29:23,367 --> 01:29:25,198
He is to be trained, then?

1115
01:29:27,247 --> 01:29:29,522
No, he will not be trained.

1116
01:29:29,647 --> 01:29:31,239
No?

1117
01:29:33,207 --> 01:29:35,163
He is too old.

1118
01:29:35,287 --> 01:29:38,916
He is the chosen one.
You must see it.

1119
01:29:40,047 --> 01:29:43,437
Clouded this boy's future is.

1120
01:29:45,567 --> 01:29:47,319
I will train him, then.

1121
01:29:51,487 --> 01:29:54,206
I take Anakin
as my Padawan learner.

1122
01:29:54,327 --> 01:29:57,125
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.

1123
01:29:57,247 --> 01:29:59,522
Impossible to take on a second.

1124
01:29:59,647 --> 01:30:01,239
The code forbids it.

1125
01:30:01,367 --> 01:30:04,598
- Obi-Wan is ready.
- I am ready to face the trials.

1126
01:30:04,727 --> 01:30:08,197
Our own counsel we will keep
on who is ready.

1127
01:30:09,167 --> 01:30:11,681
He is headstrong and he has much
to learn of the living Force...

1128
01:30:11,807 --> 01:30:13,445
but he is capable.

1129
01:30:13,567 --> 01:30:15,478
There is little more
he can learn from me.

1130
01:30:17,967 --> 01:30:21,596
Young Skywalker's fate
will be decided later.

1131
01:30:21,727 --> 01:30:24,195
Now is not the time for this.

1132
01:30:24,967 --> 01:30:26,844
The senate is voting
for a new supreme chancellor...

1133
01:30:26,967 --> 01:30:29,527
and Queen Amidala
is returning home...

1134
01:30:29,647 --> 01:30:32,719
which puts pressure on the Federation
and could widen the confrontation.

1135
01:30:32,847 --> 01:30:35,042
And draw out the queen's attacker.

1136
01:30:35,167 --> 01:30:39,365
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.

1137
01:30:40,607 --> 01:30:42,086
This is the clue we need...

1138
01:30:42,207 --> 01:30:44,675
to unravel
the mystery of the Sith.

1139
01:30:45,367 --> 01:30:47,483
May the Force be with you.

1140
01:31:00,127 --> 01:31:02,880
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.

1141
01:31:03,007 --> 01:31:04,804
From your point of view.

1142
01:31:04,927 --> 01:31:08,158
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

1143
01:31:08,287 --> 01:31:11,040
His fate is uncertain.
He's not dangerous.

1144
01:31:11,167 --> 01:31:13,442
The council will decide
Anakin's future.

1145
01:31:13,567 --> 01:31:16,365
That should be enough for you.
Now get on board.

1146
01:31:21,807 --> 01:31:25,402
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.

1147
01:31:25,527 --> 01:31:27,643
You won't be, Ani.

1148
01:31:27,767 --> 01:31:29,598
I'm not allowed to train you...

1149
01:31:29,727 --> 01:31:31,683
so I want you to watch me
and be mindful.

1150
01:31:31,807 --> 01:31:33,798
Always remember:

1151
01:31:34,687 --> 01:31:37,201
Your focus determines your reality.

1152
01:31:37,327 --> 01:31:40,763
Stay close to me
and you'll be safe.

1153
01:31:40,887 --> 01:31:42,206
Master, sir...

1154
01:31:42,327 --> 01:31:45,763
I heard Yoda talking
about midi-chlorians.

1155
01:31:45,887 --> 01:31:49,243
I've been wondering-
What are midi-chlorians?

1156
01:31:50,487 --> 01:31:52,762
Midi-chlorians are
a microscopic life-form...

1157
01:31:52,887 --> 01:31:55,037
that resides
within all living cells.

1158
01:31:56,447 --> 01:31:59,200
- They live inside me?
- Inside your cells, yes.

1159
01:31:59,327 --> 01:32:02,637
- And we are symbionts with them.
- Symbionts?

1160
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:06,476
Life-forms living together
for mutual advantage.

1161
01:32:06,607 --> 01:32:09,360
Without the midi-chlorians,
life could not exist...

1162
01:32:09,487 --> 01:32:12,160
and we would have
no knowledge of the Force.

1163
01:32:12,287 --> 01:32:14,084
They continually speak to us...

1164
01:32:14,207 --> 01:32:16,767
telling us the will of the Force.

1165
01:32:16,887 --> 01:32:18,878
When you learn
to quiet your mind...

1166
01:32:19,007 --> 01:32:20,804
<i>you'll hear them speaking to you.</i>

1167
01:32:20,927 --> 01:32:22,724
I don't understand.

1168
01:32:22,847 --> 01:32:26,203
<i>With time and training, Ani,
you will. You will.</i>

1169
01:32:30,087 --> 01:32:33,682
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure
to continue to serve and protect you.

1170
01:32:34,367 --> 01:32:35,720
I welcome your help.

1171
01:32:35,847 --> 01:32:39,396
Senator Palpatine fears that
the Federation means to destroy me.

1172
01:32:39,527 --> 01:32:42,405
I assure you I will not
allow that to happen.

1173
01:32:42,527 --> 01:32:45,280
Wesa goin' home!

1174
01:32:45,407 --> 01:32:47,204
Come on, R2.

1175
01:32:57,047 --> 01:32:59,322
<i>Is the planet secure?</i>

1176
01:32:59,447 --> 01:33:03,156
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

1177
01:33:03,287 --> 01:33:06,245
We are in complete control
of the planet now.

1178
01:33:06,367 --> 01:33:09,404
<i>Good. I will see to it
that in the senate...</i>

1179
01:33:09,527 --> 01:33:12,325
<i>things stay as they are.</i>

1180
01:33:12,447 --> 01:33:15,803
<i>I am sending my apprentice,
Darth Maul, to join you.</i>

1181
01:33:15,927 --> 01:33:17,724
Yes, my lord.

1182
01:33:17,847 --> 01:33:19,644
A Sith here?

1183
01:33:24,847 --> 01:33:27,202
Those are the forward stabilizers.

1184
01:33:27,327 --> 01:33:29,602
And those two control the pitch?

1185
01:33:31,127 --> 01:33:32,924
You catch on pretty quick.

1186
01:33:33,047 --> 01:33:34,719
As soon as we land...

1187
01:33:34,847 --> 01:33:37,361
the Federation will arrest you
and force you to sign the treaty.

1188
01:33:37,487 --> 01:33:38,476
I agree.

1189
01:33:38,607 --> 01:33:41,246
I'm not sure what you wish
to accomplish by this.

1190
01:33:41,367 --> 01:33:43,722
I will take back what's ours.

1191
01:33:44,487 --> 01:33:46,557
There are too few of us,
Your Highness.

1192
01:33:46,687 --> 01:33:48,484
We have no army.

1193
01:33:48,607 --> 01:33:49,926
And I can only protect you.

1194
01:33:50,047 --> 01:33:52,003
I can't fight a war for you.

1195
01:33:53,007 --> 01:33:53,996
Jar Jar Binks.

1196
01:33:54,887 --> 01:33:56,957
Mesa, Your Highness?

1197
01:33:57,087 --> 01:33:59,885
Yes. I need your help.

1198
01:34:04,927 --> 01:34:07,043
I have one battleship on my scope.

1199
01:34:07,167 --> 01:34:09,123
It's a droid control ship.

1200
01:34:09,247 --> 01:34:11,363
They've probably spotted us.

1201
01:34:11,487 --> 01:34:13,125
We haven't much time.

1202
01:34:24,367 --> 01:34:26,927
Jar Jar is on his way
to the Gungan city, Master.

1203
01:34:27,047 --> 01:34:28,275
Good.

1204
01:34:28,407 --> 01:34:30,557
Do you think
the queen's idea will work?

1205
01:34:30,687 --> 01:34:32,245
The Gungans will not
be easily swayed.

1206
01:34:34,247 --> 01:34:36,477
And we cannot use our power
to help her.

1207
01:34:38,207 --> 01:34:41,165
I'm sorry for
my behaviour, Master.

1208
01:34:41,287 --> 01:34:44,836
It's not my place to disagree
with you about the boy.

1209
01:34:46,687 --> 01:34:49,838
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.

1210
01:34:50,967 --> 01:34:52,764
You've been a good apprentice,
Obi-Wan.

1211
01:34:54,167 --> 01:34:56,727
And you're a much wiser man
than I am.

1212
01:34:57,407 --> 01:35:00,604
I foresee you will become
a great Jedi knight.

1213
01:35:13,087 --> 01:35:15,362
Desa nobody dare!

1214
01:35:15,487 --> 01:35:17,557
The Gungan city is deserted!

1215
01:35:17,687 --> 01:35:20,121
Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.

1216
01:35:20,247 --> 01:35:23,205
Do you think they have been taken
to the camps?

1217
01:35:23,327 --> 01:35:25,557
More likely they were wiped out.

1218
01:35:25,687 --> 01:35:28,599
- Mesa no tink so.
- Do you know where they are,Jar Jar?

1219
01:35:28,727 --> 01:35:32,003
When in trouble,
Gungans go to sacred place.

1220
01:35:32,127 --> 01:35:34,880
Mesa show you.
Come on. Mesa show you!

1221
01:35:52,487 --> 01:35:55,923
Your Honour,
Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1222
01:36:02,327 --> 01:36:05,524
Heyo dadee
Big Boss Nass, Your Honour.

1223
01:36:06,287 --> 01:36:08,596
Jar Jar Binks.

1224
01:36:09,087 --> 01:36:12,204
Who's da uss-en uthers?

1225
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:14,962
I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1226
01:36:15,767 --> 01:36:18,076
I come before you in peace.

1227
01:36:18,207 --> 01:36:20,926
Ah, Naboo biggen.

1228
01:36:21,047 --> 01:36:24,084
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.

1229
01:36:24,207 --> 01:36:27,756
Yousa all bombad.

1230
01:36:28,607 --> 01:36:31,326
We have searched you out
because we wish to form an alliance.

1231
01:36:31,447 --> 01:36:32,766
Your Honour.

1232
01:36:34,847 --> 01:36:37,680
Whosa dis?

1233
01:36:37,807 --> 01:36:39,923
I am Queen Amidala.

1234
01:36:41,527 --> 01:36:43,040
This is my decoy...

1235
01:36:43,167 --> 01:36:46,637
my protection,
my loyal bodyguard.

1236
01:36:46,767 --> 01:36:50,885
I'm sorry for my deception,
but it was necessary to protect myself.

1237
01:36:51,007 --> 01:36:53,441
Although we do not always agree,
Your Honour...

1238
01:36:53,567 --> 01:36:56,001
our two great societies
have always lived in peace.

1239
01:36:57,727 --> 01:37:00,764
The Trade Federation has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build.

1240
01:37:00,887 --> 01:37:04,004
If we do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.

1241
01:37:04,127 --> 01:37:06,243
I ask you to help us.

1242
01:37:06,367 --> 01:37:08,961
No, I beg you to help us.

1243
01:37:09,087 --> 01:37:11,362
We are your humble servants.

1244
01:37:14,487 --> 01:37:17,160
Our fate is in your hands.

1245
01:37:33,687 --> 01:37:37,760
Yousa no tinken yousa
greater den da Gungans?

1246
01:37:40,127 --> 01:37:43,881
Mesa lika dis!

1247
01:37:44,887 --> 01:37:45,717
Maybe...

1248
01:37:45,847 --> 01:37:48,281
wesa...

1249
01:37:48,407 --> 01:37:50,204
being friends.

1250
01:37:58,567 --> 01:38:00,285
We've sent our patrols.

1251
01:38:00,407 --> 01:38:03,717
We already located
their starship in the swamp.

1252
01:38:03,847 --> 01:38:05,917
It won't be long, my lord.

1253
01:38:06,047 --> 01:38:09,039
<i>This is
an unexpected move for her.</i>

1254
01:38:09,167 --> 01:38:11,078
<i>It's too aggressive.</i>

1255
01:38:11,207 --> 01:38:13,516
<i>Lord Maul, be mindful.</i>

1256
01:38:13,647 --> 01:38:16,081
<i>Let them make the first move.</i>

1257
01:38:16,207 --> 01:38:18,004
Yes, my master.

1258
01:38:21,407 --> 01:38:22,999
Deysa comin!

1259
01:38:23,127 --> 01:38:24,401
All right!

1260
01:38:27,847 --> 01:38:29,485
They're here!

1261
01:38:29,607 --> 01:38:30,926
Good. They made it.

1262
01:38:35,327 --> 01:38:37,887
Yousa doen grand.

1263
01:38:38,007 --> 01:38:40,965
Jar Jar bring uss-en
and da Naboo together.

1264
01:38:41,087 --> 01:38:42,884
Oh, no, no, no.

1265
01:38:43,007 --> 01:38:45,840
So, wesa make you...

1266
01:38:45,967 --> 01:38:48,356
bombad general.

1267
01:38:48,487 --> 01:38:49,840
General?

1268
01:38:52,807 --> 01:38:54,206
Captain.

1269
01:38:54,327 --> 01:38:56,795
- Your Highness.
- What is the situation?

1270
01:38:56,927 --> 01:38:58,724
Almost everyone's in camps.

1271
01:38:58,847 --> 01:39:01,919
A few hundred police and guards formed
an underground resistance movement.

1272
01:39:02,047 --> 01:39:04,481
I brought back as many
of the leaders as I could.

1273
01:39:04,607 --> 01:39:07,360
The Federation army's also
much larger than we thought...

1274
01:39:07,487 --> 01:39:09,079
and much stronger.

1275
01:39:10,327 --> 01:39:13,285
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

1276
01:39:13,407 --> 01:39:15,523
The battle is a diversion.

1277
01:39:15,647 --> 01:39:18,400
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.

1278
01:39:18,527 --> 01:39:20,006
R2.

1279
01:39:21,087 --> 01:39:24,397
We can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side.

1280
01:39:24,527 --> 01:39:26,165
Once we get
to the main entrance...

1281
01:39:26,287 --> 01:39:29,245
Captain Panaka
will create a diversion.

1282
01:39:29,367 --> 01:39:32,165
Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.

1283
01:39:32,887 --> 01:39:35,560
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

1284
01:39:35,687 --> 01:39:37,279
What do you think, Master Jedi?

1285
01:39:37,407 --> 01:39:39,477
The viceroy will be well-guarded.

1286
01:39:39,607 --> 01:39:41,996
The difficulty is getting
into the throne room.

1287
01:39:42,127 --> 01:39:44,322
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.

1288
01:39:44,447 --> 01:39:48,963
There is a possibility, with this
diversion, many Gungans will be killed.

1289
01:39:49,087 --> 01:39:52,238
Wesa ready to do our-san part.

1290
01:39:52,367 --> 01:39:55,359
We have a plan which should
immobilize the droid army.

1291
01:39:55,487 --> 01:39:57,284
We will send
what pilots we have...

1292
01:39:57,407 --> 01:40:00,319
to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.

1293
01:40:00,447 --> 01:40:03,359
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.

1294
01:40:03,487 --> 01:40:06,479
The weapons on your fighters
may not penetrate the shields.

1295
01:40:06,607 --> 01:40:08,165
There's an even bigger danger.

1296
01:40:08,287 --> 01:40:10,084
If the viceroy escapes,
Your Highness...

1297
01:40:10,207 --> 01:40:12,323
he will return
with another droid army.

1298
01:40:12,447 --> 01:40:15,519
Well, that is why we must not fail
to get the viceroy.

1299
01:40:15,647 --> 01:40:17,478
Everything depends on it.

1300
01:40:22,607 --> 01:40:25,121
<i>She is more foolish
than I thought.</i>

1301
01:40:25,247 --> 01:40:27,124
We are sending all troops...

1302
01:40:27,247 --> 01:40:30,000
to meet this army
assembling near the swamp.

1303
01:40:30,127 --> 01:40:32,641
It appears to be made up
of primitives.

1304
01:40:32,767 --> 01:40:35,201
<i>This will work to our advantage.</i>

1305
01:40:35,327 --> 01:40:38,000
I have your approval
to proceed, then, my lord?

1306
01:40:38,767 --> 01:40:40,405
<i>Wipe them out.</i>

1307
01:40:42,047 --> 01:40:43,844
<i>All of them.</i>

1308
01:41:13,487 --> 01:41:14,806
Halt!

1309
01:41:18,127 --> 01:41:20,277
Starting up the shield.

1310
01:41:48,607 --> 01:41:49,756
Open fire.

1311
01:42:05,207 --> 01:42:08,279
Once we get inside, you find
a safe place to hide and stay there.

1312
01:42:08,407 --> 01:42:10,238
- Sure.
- Stay there.

1313
01:42:25,567 --> 01:42:27,523
Roger, roger.

1314
01:42:35,247 --> 01:42:38,239
I thought the battle was going
to take place far from here.

1315
01:42:39,287 --> 01:42:40,720
This is too close.

1316
01:42:46,447 --> 01:42:48,722
Ani, find cover.

1317
01:42:48,847 --> 01:42:51,042
- Quick!
- Get to your ships!

1318
01:43:47,407 --> 01:43:48,476
Fighters straight ahead.

1319
01:43:48,607 --> 01:43:49,676
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1320
01:43:49,807 --> 01:43:50,956
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1321
01:43:59,287 --> 01:44:00,322
Cease fire.

1322
01:44:07,567 --> 01:44:09,876
Steady. Steady.

1323
01:44:41,647 --> 01:44:44,719
- Activate the droids.
- Yes, sir.

1324
01:45:00,567 --> 01:45:02,398
Ouch time.

1325
01:45:15,927 --> 01:45:16,962
Fire!

1326
01:45:38,327 --> 01:45:40,079
My guess is the viceroy's
in the throne room.

1327
01:45:40,207 --> 01:45:41,606
Red group! Blue group!

1328
01:45:41,727 --> 01:45:43,445
Everybody, this way!

1329
01:45:43,567 --> 01:45:45,523
Hey, wait for me!

1330
01:45:45,647 --> 01:45:47,922
Anakin, stay where you are.
You'll be safe there.

1331
01:45:48,047 --> 01:45:49,958
- But I-
- Stay in that cockpit.

1332
01:46:01,647 --> 01:46:04,719
- We'll handle this.
- We'll take the long way.

1333
01:46:24,087 --> 01:46:25,918
We gotta do something, R2.

1334
01:46:47,807 --> 01:46:50,685
I'm trying to!
I don't know where the trigger is!

1335
01:46:54,007 --> 01:46:56,919
Oops, wrong one.
Maybe it's this one.

1336
01:46:57,887 --> 01:47:00,238
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

1337
01:47:02,367 --> 01:47:03,277
Yeah!

1338
01:47:08,447 --> 01:47:09,880
Let's go!

1339
01:47:10,927 --> 01:47:13,077
It's on automatic pilot.

1340
01:47:21,807 --> 01:47:23,604
Try to override it.

1341
01:48:21,207 --> 01:48:23,038
We don't have time for this,
Captain.

1342
01:48:28,927 --> 01:48:30,679
Look, there they are.

1343
01:48:30,807 --> 01:48:33,082
That's where
the autopilot's taking us.

1344
01:48:49,407 --> 01:48:51,921
Dumb droid. Take that!

1345
01:48:52,047 --> 01:48:53,878
Get off! Get off! Get off!

1346
01:48:54,007 --> 01:48:55,122
Get off!

1347
01:49:04,767 --> 01:49:07,042
The deflector shield
is too strong.

1348
01:49:15,967 --> 01:49:17,559
This is tense!

1349
01:49:19,767 --> 01:49:21,678
R2, get us off this autopilot.

1350
01:49:21,807 --> 01:49:23,604
It's gonna get us both killed.

1351
01:49:25,207 --> 01:49:27,516
You did it, R2!

1352
01:49:27,647 --> 01:49:28,796
Let's go left.

1353
01:49:33,807 --> 01:49:34,876
Go back?

1354
01:49:35,007 --> 01:49:39,125
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

1355
01:49:45,727 --> 01:49:48,082
I'll try spinning.
That's a good trick.

1356
01:49:53,527 --> 01:49:55,961
I know we're in trouble.
Just hang on.

1357
01:50:02,527 --> 01:50:03,482
Go!

1358
01:50:08,127 --> 01:50:09,765
Ascension guns!

1359
01:52:10,767 --> 01:52:12,325
Retreat! Retreat!

1360
01:52:14,007 --> 01:52:15,838
Dis is nutsen.

1361
01:52:25,327 --> 01:52:27,204
Uh-oh. Big boomers.

1362
01:52:47,087 --> 01:52:49,396
Give me a lift!

1363
01:52:56,367 --> 01:52:57,880
Jar Jar, usen da booma!

1364
01:52:58,007 --> 01:52:59,838
What?
Mesa no have a booma!

1365
01:52:59,967 --> 01:53:01,844
Here. Taken dis one.

1366
01:53:17,607 --> 01:53:18,642
Jar Jar!

1367
01:53:18,767 --> 01:53:20,644
Jump,Jar Jar, jump!

1368
01:53:30,407 --> 01:53:33,080
Put down your weapons.
They win this round.

1369
01:53:45,487 --> 01:53:47,523
We're hit, R2!

1370
01:54:00,207 --> 01:54:03,040
I'm trying to stop!
I'm trying to stop!

1371
01:54:09,967 --> 01:54:11,446
Everything's overheated.

1372
01:54:12,847 --> 01:54:14,724
Oops. This is not good.

1373
01:55:24,207 --> 01:55:26,323
No giben up, General Jar Jar.

1374
01:55:26,447 --> 01:55:28,244
Mesa think of something.

1375
01:55:28,367 --> 01:55:29,686
Hands up.

1376
01:55:29,807 --> 01:55:32,560
My give up. My give up.

1377
01:55:40,927 --> 01:55:43,919
Your little insurrection
is at an end, Your Highness.

1378
01:55:44,047 --> 01:55:45,844
Time for you
to sign the treaty and end...

1379
01:55:45,967 --> 01:55:47,764
this pointless debate in the senate.

1380
01:55:47,887 --> 01:55:49,559
Viceroy!

1381
01:55:49,687 --> 01:55:51,518
Your occupation here has ended.

1382
01:55:53,047 --> 01:55:56,278
After her.
This one's a decoy.

1383
01:56:02,607 --> 01:56:04,006
Captain!

1384
01:56:12,887 --> 01:56:14,843
Jam the doors.

1385
01:56:18,167 --> 01:56:20,920
Now, Viceroy,
we will discuss a new treaty.

1386
01:57:21,527 --> 01:57:23,916
Yes! We have power.
Shields up.

1387
01:57:27,087 --> 01:57:28,076
Take this!

1388
01:57:30,007 --> 01:57:31,042
And this!

1389
01:57:38,607 --> 01:57:40,279
- Oops.
- We're losing power.

1390
01:57:40,407 --> 01:57:42,159
There seems to be a problem
with the main reactor.

1391
01:57:42,287 --> 01:57:43,606
Impossible!

1392
01:57:43,727 --> 01:57:45,524
Nothing can get through our shield.

1393
01:57:46,767 --> 01:57:48,485
Let's get outta here.

1394
01:57:56,207 --> 01:57:58,721
What's that?
It's blowing up from the inside!

1395
01:58:01,647 --> 01:58:03,160
We didn't hit it.

1396
01:58:06,127 --> 01:58:08,083
Now, this is Podracing.

1397
01:58:09,647 --> 01:58:11,285
Look, one of ours,
out of the main hold!

1398
01:58:31,807 --> 01:58:33,206
What the-

1399
01:58:33,327 --> 01:58:35,443
Was'n they doing?

1400
01:58:35,567 --> 01:58:39,003
The control ship
has been destroyed. Look!

1401
01:58:40,647 --> 01:58:42,877
They all broke-ed.

1402
01:59:29,327 --> 01:59:32,558
No, it's too late.

1403
01:59:32,687 --> 01:59:34,882
- No.
- Obi-Wan.

1404
01:59:36,127 --> 01:59:37,924
Promise-

1405
01:59:38,047 --> 01:59:40,481
<i>Promise me
you will train the boy.</i>

1406
01:59:40,607 --> 01:59:42,086
Yes, Master.

1407
01:59:46,007 --> 01:59:48,475
He is the chosen one.

1408
01:59:48,607 --> 01:59:51,679
He will bring balance.

1409
01:59:52,847 --> 01:59:54,200
Train him.

1410
02:00:20,607 --> 02:00:22,325
Now, Viceroy...

1411
02:00:22,447 --> 02:00:25,723
<i>you're going to have to go back
to the senate and explain all this.</i>

1412
02:00:27,407 --> 02:00:30,558
<i>I think you can kiss
your trade franchise goodbye.</i>

1413
02:00:43,727 --> 02:00:47,117
We are indebted to you
for your bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1414
02:00:47,247 --> 02:00:49,044
And you, young Skywalker.

1415
02:00:49,807 --> 02:00:52,958
We will watch your career
with great interest.

1416
02:00:59,247 --> 02:01:01,681
Congratulations on your election,
Chancellor.

1417
02:01:01,807 --> 02:01:05,083
Your boldness has saved our people,
Your Majesty.

1418
02:01:05,207 --> 02:01:07,482
It's you who should be
congratulated.

1419
02:01:07,607 --> 02:01:11,361
Together we shall bring peace
and prosperity to the Republic.

1420
02:01:16,207 --> 02:01:20,439
Confer on you the level
of Jedi knight the council does.

1421
02:01:20,567 --> 02:01:25,083
But agree with your taking this boy
as your Padawan learner...

1422
02:01:25,207 --> 02:01:27,004
I do not.

1423
02:01:27,127 --> 02:01:29,118
Qui-Gon believed in him.

1424
02:01:31,927 --> 02:01:34,487
The chosen one the boy may be.

1425
02:01:34,607 --> 02:01:36,165
Nevertheless...

1426
02:01:36,287 --> 02:01:39,040
grave danger I fear
in his training.

1427
02:01:39,167 --> 02:01:43,126
Master Yoda,
I gave Qui-Gon my word.

1428
02:01:43,247 --> 02:01:45,078
I will train Anakin.

1429
02:01:47,247 --> 02:01:49,477
Without the approval
of the council, if I must.

1430
02:01:49,607 --> 02:01:51,962
Qui-Gon's defiance
I sense in you.

1431
02:01:52,087 --> 02:01:53,918
Need that you do not.

1432
02:01:56,087 --> 02:01:59,204
Agree with you the council does.

1433
02:02:00,287 --> 02:02:03,438
Your apprentice Skywalker will be.

1434
02:02:30,127 --> 02:02:31,799
What will happen to me now?

1435
02:02:31,927 --> 02:02:34,839
The council have granted me
permission to train you.

1436
02:02:34,967 --> 02:02:38,243
You will be a Jedi, I promise.

1437
02:02:47,287 --> 02:02:50,518
There's no doubt
the mysterious warrior was a Sith.

1438
02:02:50,647 --> 02:02:53,002
Always two there are.

1439
02:02:53,127 --> 02:02:56,199
No more, no less.

1440
02:02:56,327 --> 02:02:59,125
A master and an apprentice.

1441
02:02:59,247 --> 02:03:00,726
But which was destroyed?

1442
02:03:00,847 --> 02:03:03,680
The master or the apprentice?

1443
02:03:27,327 --> 02:03:29,283
Hidoe, everybody!

1444
02:04:14,007 --> 02:04:15,838
Peace!
