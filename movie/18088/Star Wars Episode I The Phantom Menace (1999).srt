1
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,980
很久以前在遙遠的銀河系...

2
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,860
星際大戰

3
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:49,470
首部曲：威脅潛伏

4
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,280
銀河共和國內已爆發動亂

5
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,350
銀河系之間的貿易重稅

6
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,350
是爭論的主因

7
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,410
為達到殺一儆百的作用

8
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,490
貪婪的貿易聯邦以致命戰艦

9
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,560
封鎖一切進入那卜星球的貨運

10
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,640
當共和國各會員國

11
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,700
對這一連串危機爭論不休之際

12
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,770
最高議長秘密派遣兩名

13
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,840
維護和平與正義的絕地武士

14
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,920
前往處理這件糾紛

15
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,040
船長    是的
- Captain. - Yes, sir?

16
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,640
通知他們，我們要登艦
Tell them we wish to board at once.

17
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:10,930
最高議長派遣的大使要登艦
- [ Machinery Beeping ] - With all due respect, the ambassadors for the supreme chancellor wish to board immediately.

18
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,490
好的
Yes, of course.

19
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,050
這項封鎖行動完全合法
As you know, our blockade is perfectly legal,

20
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,700
我們很樂意接待兩位大使
and we'd be happy to receive the ambassadors.

21
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,430
我負責接待兩位，這邊請
I'm TC-1 4 at your service. This way, please.

22
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,830
兩位來訪我們深感榮幸
We are greatly honored by your visit, Ambassadors.

23
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,900
請隨便坐，主人馬上就到
Make yourselves comfortable. My master will be with you shortly.

24
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,010
我有不祥的預感
I have a bad feeling about this.

25
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,850
我沒有感覺
- I don't sense anything. - It's not about the mission, Master.

26
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,480
不是這項任務，師父 而是一種模糊的預兆
It's something... elsewhere, elusive.

27
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,850
歐比王，別只顧著擔心
Don't center on your anxieties, Obi-Wan.

28
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,020
把心思放在現在的處境
Keep your concentration here and now, where it belongs.

29
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,030
尤達大師說我應該擔心未來
But Master Yoda said I should be mindful of the future.

30
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,130
別忽略眼前的問題
But not at the expense of the moment.

31
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,960
你要專心想著你的原力
Be mindful of the living Force, young Padawan.

32
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,440
是，師父
Yes, Master.

33
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,210
總督會怎麼回應議長的要求？
How do you think this trade viceroy will deal with the chancellor's demands?

34
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,510
貿易聯邦總督是個懦夫
These Federation types are cowards.

35
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,410
談判一定會很快結束
The negotiations will be short.

36
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,740
什麼？你說什麼？
What? What did you say?

37
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,850
兩位大使是絕地武士
The ambassadors areJedi knights, I believe.

38
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,220
我就知道，他們要來硬的
I knew it. They're here to force a settlement.

39
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,620
去應付他們，我通知達斯西帝
Distract them. I will contact Lord Sidious.

40
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:02,400
別傻了，我才不惹絕地武士
Are you brain-dead? I'm not going in there with twoJedi.

41
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,360
派機械人去
Send a droid.

42
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,680
通常都要等這麼久嗎？  不是
Is it in their nature to make us wait this long?

43
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,380
我感應到他們對談判充滿恐懼
No. I sense an unusual amount of fear for something as trivial as this trade dispute.

44
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,630
什麼事？
What is it?

45
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,860
西帝，你的計劃失敗了
This scheme of yours has failed, Lord Sidious.

46
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,630
我們不敢對抗絕地武士
The blockade is finished. We dare not go against theseJedi.

47
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,600
總督，別讓我再看到這矮冬瓜
Viceroy, I don't want this stunted slime in my sight again.

48
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,610
很不幸，我們必須速戰速決
This turn of events is unfortunate.

49
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,740
開始派遣部隊登陸
We must accelerate our plans. Begin landing your troops.

50
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,550
西帝，這合法嗎？
My lord, is that legal?

51
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,950
我會讓它合法
I will make it legal.

52
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,380
絕地武士呢？
And theJedi?

53
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,090
最高議長不應該找他們來
The chancellor should never have brought them into this.

54
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,860
馬上殺了他們
Kill them immediately.

55
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,760
是，西帝，馬上照辦
Yes. Yes, my lord. Uh, as you wish.

56
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:09,790
船長，你看
Captain, look!

57
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,470
打開防護罩
Shields up!

58
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,180
不好意思
Sorry.

59
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,210
毒氣
Dioxis.

60
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:33,030
他們應該死了，把他們趕盡殺絕
They must be dead by now. Destroy what's left of them.

61
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,990
對不起
Oh! Excuse me.

62
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,930
你進去看看
- Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.

63
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,270
遵命
- Roger, roger.

64
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,960
把他們轟掉
Uh-oh. Blast them.

65
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,270
發生什麼事？
What is going on down there?

66
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,310
我們失去通訊
We lost the transmission, sir.

67
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,930
你見過絕地武士嗎？
Have you ever encountered a Jedi knight before, sir?

68
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,390
沒有
Well, no, but I don't--

69
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,820
封鎖艦橋    是，長官
Seal off the bridge. - Yes, sir.

70
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,290
這還不夠
- That won't be enough, sir.

71
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,400
派出毀滅者機械人
I want droidekas up here at once!

72
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,200
咱們死定了
We will not survive this.

73
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,480
關閉霹靂門
Close the blast doors!

74
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,620
這就能擋住他們
That will hold them.

75
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,430
他們還是衝進來了！
They are still coming through.

76
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,470
不可能
This is impossible!

77
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,800
毀滅者機械人呢？
Where are those droidekas?

78
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,710
師父，是毀滅者
Master! Destroyers!

79
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,980
它們有防護罩
They have shield generators!

80
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,720
走吧
It's a standoff. Let's go.

81
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,860
他們打不過毀滅者
They're no match for droidekas.

82
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,440
他們逃進通風孔
Sir! They've gone up the ventilation shaft.

83
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,350
戰鬥機械人
- Battle droids.

84
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,880
這是支侵略部隊
- It's an invasion army.

85
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,320
貿易聯邦這一棋下得很險
This is an odd play for the Trade Federation.

86
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,550
要警告那卜星，通知魏倫議長
We've got to warn the Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum.

87
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,890
分開行動
Let's split up.

88
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,720
藏在不同戰艦，在地面會合
Stow aboard separate ships and meet down on the planet.

89
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,450
師父，你說對一件事
You were right about one thing, Master.

90
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,360
談判很快就結束
The negotiations were short.

91
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,470
來自那卜星的訊號
Sir, a transmission from the planet.

92
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,000
是艾米達拉皇后
It's Queen Amidala herself.

93
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,370
事情終於有進展了
At last we are getting results.

94
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,940
陛下，很高興再見面
Again you come before us, Your Highness.

95
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,080
總督，別高興得太早
You will not be so pleased when you hear what I have to say, Viceroy.

96
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,020
你們的封鎖行動已經失敗
Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.

97
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,410
我怎麼不知道？
I was not aware of such failure.

98
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,220
我知道兩位大使已經抵達
I have word that the chancellor's ambassadors are with you now...

99
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,690
現在應該已經達成協議
and that you have been commanded to reach settlement.

100
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,630
我不知道大使要來
I know nothing of any ambassadors.

101
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,130
你一定搞錯了
You must be mistaken.

102
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,100
請你聽好
Beware, Viceroy.

103
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,840
貿易聯邦這次太過份了
The Federation has gone too far this time.

104
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,200
沒議長允許，我們決不敢亂來
We would never do anything without the approval of the senate.

105
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,040
你太多心了
You assume too much.

106
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,240
等著瞧吧
We will see.

107
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,610
她說得對
- She's right.

108
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,910
議會絕不容許    來不及了
The senate will never-- - It's too late now.

109
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,050
她懷疑我們要進攻嗎？
- Do you think she suspects an attack?

110
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,050
不曉得
- I don't know.

111
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,350
我們得趕快切斷他們的通訊
But we must move quickly to disrupt all communications down there.

112
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,830
大使缺席所以談判不成？
Negotiations haven't started because the ambassadors aren't there?

113
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,730
怎麼會？
How could that be true?

114
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,610
議長說他的大使早就到了
I have assurances from the chancellor his ambassadors did arrive.

115
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,850
一定是...談判...
[ Distorted Voice ] It must-- handiwork-- negotiate-- ambassadors--

116
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,780
白卜庭議員？
-nobody would-- - Senator Palpatine.

117
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,550
怎麼回事？
What's happening?

118
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,220
去檢查傳訊器
Check the transmission generator.

119
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,920
通訊中斷只有一個解釋
A communications disruption can mean only one thing:

120
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,160
開始入侵
invasion.

121
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,600
他們不敢這麼做
The Federation would not dare go that far.

122
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,420
共和國會撤銷他們的貿易特權
The senate would revoke their trade franchise, and they'd be finished.

123
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,400
我們必須繼續談判
We must continue to rely on negotiation.

124
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,870
談判？通訊完全中斷
Negotiation? We've lost all communications.

125
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,280
大使又不知去向
And where are the chancellor's ambassadors?

126
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,070
情況十分危急
This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness.

127
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,540
保安隊無法抵抗貿易聯邦軍隊
Our security volunteers will be no match against a battle-hardened Federation army.

128
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,380
我絕不容許挑釁宣戰的行為
I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war.

129
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,450
是，總督
- Yes, Viceroy? - Captain, we've searched the ship,

130
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,660
指揮艦沒有絕地武士的蹤影
and there is no trace of theJedi.

131
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,490
他們一定藏在戰艦上
They may have gotten on one of your landing craft.

132
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,900
我們會找到他們
If they're down here, sir, we'll find them.

133
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:46,370
千萬小心，別低估絕地武士
Use caution. TheseJedi are not to be underestimated.

134
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,140
快躲開
- Oh, no! - Get away! Get out of here!

135
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,080
快躲開
- Get down!

136
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,600
什麼東東呀？
Was'n dat?

137
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,030
等一下
Hey, wait!

138
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,600
呀呀呀！我愛你
Oh, mooie-mooie! I love you!

139
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,840
差點害死我們！用腦袋想想
You almost got us killed. Are you brainless?

140
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,310
我會講話喔
- I spake.

141
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,570
會講話不代表有智慧，快走吧
- The ability to speak does not make you intelligent.

142
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,850
我不走，我是恰恰冰克斯
- Now, get out of here. - No, no, mesa stay.

143
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,910
我是你的僕人
Mesa culled JarJar Binks. Mesa your humble servant.

144
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,940
不必了
- That won't be necessary. - Oh, but it 'tis.

145
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,160
不行，這是老天的安排
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.

146
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,700
趴下來
- Oh, no! Whoo! - Stay down!

147
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,470
你又救了我一命
You saved my again.

148
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,330
這是什麼？    本地人
- What's this? - A local.

149
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,870
快走吧，機械人要來了
- Let's get out of here before more droids show up. - More?

150
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:58,470
機械人？還有嗎？
'' More'' did you spake?

151
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,210
對不起哦
Ex-squeeze-me,

152
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:03,750
最安全的地方是剛戈市
but de mostest safest place would be Gunga City.

153
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,620
那是我長大的城市，很隱密
Is where I grew up. 'Tis a hidden city.

154
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,120
城市？
- A city? - Uh-huh.

155
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,520
你能帶我們去嗎？
- Can you take us there? - Uh, on second thought, no.

156
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:17,150
讓我想一想，不行咧 不行？
- Not really, no. - No?

157
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,460
說起來挺丟臉的
'Tis embarrassing,

158
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:24,910
不過我被放逐了，差點忘了
but, uh, my afraid my've been banished. My forgotten. Da bosses would do terrible tings to me.

159
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,900
我回去一定會被那斯老大宰了
- Terrible tings to me if me goen back dare. -[ Rumbling Sound ]

160
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,710
你聽到嗎？
- You hear that?

161
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,180
聽到
- Yah.

162
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,610
成千上萬的機器人正殺過來
That is the sound of a thousand terrible things heading this way.

163
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,380
一旦發現我們
If they find us,

164
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,580
我們就會粉身碎骨
they will crush us,

165
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,450
體無完膚，連骨頭都找不到
grind us into tiny pieces and blast us into oblivion.

166
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,260
你說得有道理
Oh. Yousa point is well seen.

167
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,420
這裏，快點
This way. Hurry!

168
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,200
還有多遠？
- How much further?

169
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,530
咱們得潛水
- Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

170
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,440
我警告你們，剛耿族不喜歡外人
Ah, my warning you.

171
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,810
他們不歡迎你們
Gungans no liken outsiders, so don't spect a warm welcome.

172
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,940
放心，很多人都不歡迎我們
Oh, don't worry. This hasn't been our day for warm welcomes.

173
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,850
跟著我，知道嗎？
Yousa follow me now, okeyday?

174
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,080
回老家真好
[JarJar] So good bein home!

175
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,690
你站住！
- [ Creature Growling ] - Hey, yousa. - Stopa dare! - Heyo-dales, Cap'n Tarpals.

176
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,570
哈羅，大炮隊長，我回來了
Mesa back!

177
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,560
恰恰，又是你，去見老大
Noah gain,JarJar. Yousa goen tada bosses.

178
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,900
你這次麻煩大了
Yousa in big dudu dis time.

179
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,740
太沒禮貌了
[ Gasps ] How wude.

180
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:58,080
你們不能來這兒
Tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk! Yousa cannot bees hair.

181
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:02,420
機械兵團是你們招惹來的
Dis army of Mackineeks up dare is new weesong.

182
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,930
它們準備侵略那卜星
A droid army is about to attack the Naboo.

183
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,430
我們得警告他們
We must warn them.

184
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,200
我不喜歡那卜人
Wesa no like da Naboo. Tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk.

185
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,070
他們自以為很聰明
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.

186
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,110
自以為很偉大
Day tink day brains so big.

187
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,540
機械兵團一旦掌控那卜族
Once those droids take control of the surface,

188
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,310
你們也難逃一死
they will take control of you.

189
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,880
才怪
Mesa no tink so.

190
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,590
它們找不到咱們
Day not know of uss-en.

191
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,920
你們和那卜人是生命共同體
You and the Naboo form a symbiont circle.

192
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,360
必須同生共死，明白嗎？
What happens to one of you will affect the other. You must understand this.

193
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:38,160
咱們才不管那卜人死活
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

194
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,660
那就把我們送走
Then speed us on our way.

195
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,600
要走就快滾
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

196
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,470
我們要交通工具
We could use a transport.

197
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,440
我給你一艘邦戈
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

198
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,780
到那卜星最快的方法是
- Hmm? - Da speediest way tooda Naboo...

199
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:57,610
從地心穿出去
'tis goen through the planet core.

200
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,450
去吧
Now... go.

201
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,820
多謝相助，我們和平離去
Thank you for your help. We leave in peace.

202
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,060
師父，邦戈是什麼？
Master, what's a bongo?

203
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,650
希望是艘船
A transport, I hope.

204
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,160
他們在耍你們
Deysa setten yousa up.

205
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:14,130
從地心穿出去會要人命
Goen through da planet core? Bad bombin'.

206
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:18,330
你們要幫幫我
Mmm... any help here would be hot.

207
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,500
師父，沒時間了
Master, we're short on time.

208
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,310
我們需要一個嚮導
We'll need a navigator to get us through the planet's core.

209
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,300
他也許幫得上忙
This Gungan may be of help.

210
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,450
恰恰冰克斯會怎麼樣？
What is to become ofJarJar Binks here?

211
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:36,920
他會受到處罰
Hisen soon to be pune-ished.

212
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,890
我救了他一命
- Ohh. - I saved his life.

213
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,460
他欠我一條人命
He owes me what you call a ''life-debt.''

214
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,420
照你們的規矩他的命是我的
Your gods demand that his life belongs to me now.

215
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,840
冰克斯
Binkssssss,

216
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:56,170
你欠這個人一條命嗎？
yousa havena liveplay with thisen hisen? Mm, uh-huh.

217
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,570
跟他去吧
Begone wit him!

218
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,780
別把我拖下水
Count me outta dis one.

219
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,790
我死都不穿過地心
Better dead here than dead in da core.

220
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,620
老天，我在說什麼？
Yee gods! What mesa sayin?

221
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,740
我秀逗啦
Dis is nutsen.

222
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,310
奧比海怪
Oh, gooberfish!

223
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,750
你為什麼被放逐？
- Why were you banished,JarJar? - It's a longo tale-o,

224
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:42,750
說來話長，大概是因為我... 笨笨的
buta small part of it would be mesa... clumsy.

225
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,650
你很拙所以被放逐？
- You were banished because you were clumsy?

226
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,650
可以這麼說
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

227
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:04,810
我出了一、兩個小小的意外
Mesa caused mabbe one, two-y lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

228
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,110
不小心把老大的船炸掉
Yud-say boom da gassar,

229
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,910
然後就被放逐
den crashin der boss's heyblibber, den banished.

230
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,220
大海怪！大尖牙！
Big gooberfish! Huge-o teeth!

231
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,240
永遠是大魚吃小魚
- There's always a bigger fish.

232
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,110
咱們應該回家去
- Mesa tink we goen back now.

233
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,750
侵略行動按時進行
The invasion is on schedule, my lord.

234
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,790
議會還在慢慢討論議程
I have the senate bogged down in procedures.

235
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,400
他們只得讓你佔領那卜星
They will have no choice but to accept your control of the system.

236
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,730
皇后相信議會一定會支持她
The queen has great faith that the senate will side with her.

237
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,300
艾米達拉皇后年幼無知
Queen Amidala is young and naive.

238
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,840
你能把她玩弄於股掌
You will find controlling her will not be difficult.

239
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,510
是，西帝
Yes, my lord.

240
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,140
你沒提到失蹤的絕地武士
You didn't tell him about the missing Jedi.

241
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:18,710
等我們找到他們再向他報告
No need to report that to him until we have something to report.

242
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,220
搞什麼東東？
- Where wesa goin?

243
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,660
原力會引導我們
- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

244
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,920
什麼原力有這麼大？
Ohh, maxi big, da Force.

245
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,870
好像不太可靠
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

246
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,390
我們失去動力
-[ Alarm Blaring ] - We're losing power. [ Whimpers ] Ohhh, no!

247
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,740
咱們死定了
Wesa dyin' here. [ Sobbing ]

248
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,680
放心，問題不大
-Just relax. We're not in trouble yet. - What ''yet''?

249
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,580
什麼？外面有怪物
Monsters out dare. Leak'n in here.

250
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:55,860
潛艇沒有動力又在下沉 你還說問題不大？
All sink'n and no power? Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

251
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,220
動力恢復了
- Power's back. - Huh?

252
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,550
怪物也回來了
Aah, monster's back! [ Blubbering ]

253
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,590
放輕鬆
- [ Whimpering ] - Relax.

254
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,770
你把他嚇昏了
- Ohh. - You overdid it.

255
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,720
往那上面去
- Horrible. - Head for that outcropping.

256
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,690
天啊
[ Blubbers ] Oh, boy.

257
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,030
總督，我們抓到皇后
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

258
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,230
勝利了
Ah, victory.

259
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,910
好美的地方
Mmm, dis'n loverly.

260
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,080
你要怎麼向議會解釋？
How will you explain this invasion to the senate?

261
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:42,360
我和皇后要簽署合法的條約
The queen and I will sign a treaty that will legitimize our occupation here.

262
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,760
我相信議會一定同意
I have assurances it will be ratified by the senate.

263
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:49,360
我絕不合作    別這樣，陛下
- I will not cooperate. - Now, now, Your Highness.

264
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:53,460
當百姓受苦，你就會改變主意
In time, the suffering of your people will persuade you to see our point of view.

265
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,670
少校    是，長官
- Commander. - Yes, sir.

266
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,280
把他們帶走
- Process them. - Captain, take them to Camp 4.

267
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,480
帶到四號戰俘營    遵命
Roger, roger.

268
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,300
陛下，請跟我們走
- We should leave the street, Your Highness.

269
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:00,900
奪走它們的武器
- Get their weapons.

270
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,600
你們真是棒呆了
Whoa! Yousa guys bombad!

271
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,880
我們是議長派來的大使
We're ambassadors for the supreme chancellor.

272
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,110
你們的談判失敗了
Your negotiations seemed to have failed, Ambassador.

273
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,050
根本就沒有談判
The negotiations never took place.

274
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,550
我們必須聯絡上共和國
It's urgent that we make contact with the Republic.

275
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,780
他們切斷所有通訊
- They've knocked out all our communications.

276
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,080
有飛船嗎？
- Do you have transports?

277
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,920
在停機棚，這兒
In the main hangar. This way.

278
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,720
敵人太多了
- There are too many of them.

279
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,190
沒問題
- That won't be a problem.

280
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,940
請你跟我們到科魯斯根行星
Your Highness, under the circumstances, I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

281
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,140
謝謝，但我要和人民同生共死
Thank you, Ambassador, but my place is with my people.

282
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,670
他們會殺了你
- They will kill you if you stay.

283
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,010
他們不敢
- They wouldn't dare.

284
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,670
他們需要她簽署條約
They need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion legal.

285
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,810
不會殺死她
They can't afford to kill her.

286
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,920
他們另有陰謀
There is something else behind all this, Your Highness.

287
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,150
侵略行動不合邏輯
There's no logic in the Federation's move here.

288
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,190
我認為他們想消滅你們
My feelings tell me they will destroy you.

289
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,950
我們只能仰賴議會
Our only hope is for the senate to side with us.

290
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,290
白卜庭需要你的幫忙
Senator Palpatine will need your help.

291
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,590
不管怎樣我們都很危險
Either choice presents great danger... to us all.

292
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,300
但我們都很勇敢
We are brave, Your Highness.

293
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:03,160
你要走就得馬上走
If you are to leave, Your Highness, it must be now.

294
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,330
我會親自向議會請求
Then I will plead our case to the senate.

295
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:09,200
保重，總督
Be careful, Governor.

296
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,980
我們得救出飛行員
We'll need to free those pilots.

297
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,780
交給我
I'll deal with that.

298
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:27,620
站住
- Halt! - I'm ambassador to the supreme chancellor.

299
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:31,390
我是議長大使，要去科魯斯根
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

300
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,460
你去哪兒？
- Where are you taking them?

301
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,690
科魯斯根星
- To Coruscant.

302
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,970
不對，我查不出來
Coruscant? Uh, that doesn't compute.

303
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,400
站住，你被捕了
Uh, wait. You're under arrest.

304
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,240
快走吧
Come on. Move!

305
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,410
快走
Go!

306
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:21,310
別亂跑，別惹麻煩
Now, stay here and keep out of trouble.

307
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,950
大家好
- Hello, boyos. - [ Beeping, Whistling ]

308
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,260
敵方戰艦
There's the blockade.

309
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,370
防護罩受損
- [ Alarm Beeping ] - The shield generator's been hit!

310
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,110
好兇哦
How wude!

311
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,990
修護機械人都被打中
We're losing droids fast.

312
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:12,460
沒有防護罩就死定了
If we can't get the shield generator fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.

313
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,730
失去防護罩
- The shields are gone. - [ Whistling, Beeping ]

314
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,370
動力恢復了
The power's back!

315
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,550
那小機械人修好了主動力引擎
That little droid did it. He bypassed the main power drive.

316
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,880
防護罩完全發揮效能
Deflector shields up at maximum.

317
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,790
到不了科魯斯根星
There's not enough power to get us to Coruscant.

318
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,620
超光速引擎受損
The hyperdrive is leaking.

319
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:50,630
一定得到哪兒加油和維修
We'll have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship.

320
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,840
這兒，塔土印星
Here, Master. Tatooine.

321
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,070
這麼偏遠一定沒貿易聯邦爪牙
Small, out of the way, poor. The Trade Federation have no presence there.

322
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,440
你怎麼知道？
How can you be sure?

323
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,540
它受到赫特族控制
It's controlled by the Hutts.

324
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,640
不能帶皇后到土匪窩
You can't take Her Royal Highness there. The Hutts are gangsters.

325
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,980
要是他們發現她
- If they discovered her-- - It'd be no different than if we landed...

326
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,020
總比降落在貿易聯邦地盤好
on a system controlled by the Federation,

327
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,010
因為赫特族沒有在找她
except that the Hutts aren't looking for her, which gives us the advantage.

328
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,890
皇后簽好條約了嗎？
And Queen Amidala, has she signed the treaty?

329
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:23,140
西帝，她失蹤了
She has disappeared, my lord.

330
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,540
一艘飛船穿過我們的封鎖
One Naboo cruiser got past the blockade.

331
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,070
我要她簽署條約
[ Snarls ] I want that treaty signed.

332
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,740
西帝
My lord,

333
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:38,210
太遠了，找不到那艘飛船
it's impossible to locate the ship. It's out of our range.

334
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,150
西斯人就找得到
Not for a Sith.

335
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,050
這是我的徒弟
This is my apprentice,

336
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,810
達斯魔
Darth Maul.

337
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,630
他會找到那艘飛船
He will find your lost ship.

338
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,860
情況越來越糟
This is getting out of hand.

339
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,230
他們有兩個人
Now there are two of them.

340
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:01,270
我們不應該聽他的話
We should not have made this bargain.

341
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:10,410
陛下，這小機械人很勇敢
An extremely well-put-together little droid, Your Highness.

342
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,620
它救了我們的命
Without a doubt, it saved the ship, as well as our lives.

343
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,850
我要表揚它，它叫什麼？
It is to be commended. What is its number?

344
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,790
阿土低土（R2D2）
R2-D2, Your Highness.

345
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,260
謝謝你，阿土低土（R2D2）
- Thank you, R2-D2. - [ Happy Chirping ]

346
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,130
珮米
Padme.

347
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,990
把它清洗乾淨
Clean this droid up as best you can.

348
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,230
我們得好好謝謝它
It deserves our gratitude.

349
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,470
請繼續，隊長
Continue, Captain.

350
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:45,280
我們要去偏遠的塔土印星
Your Highness, with your permission, we're heading for a remote planet called Tatooine.

351
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,540
那是個三不管地帶
It's in a system far beyond the reach of the Trade Federation.

352
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,450
我不同意他的決定
I do not agree with theJedi on this.

353
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,090
請你相信我的判斷
You must trust my judgment, Your Highness.

354
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,700
哈羅
[JarJar ] Hello.

355
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,660
對不起，你是誰？
Sorry. Husa are yousa?

356
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,300
我是珮米
I'm Padme.

357
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,040
我是恰恰冰克斯
Mesa JarJar Binks.

358
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,500
你是剛耿人
You're a Gungan, aren't you?

359
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,440
怎麼會跑來這兒？
- How'd you end up here with us? - My no know.

360
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:20,350
不知道 我正在高高興興地吃早飯
Mesa day starten pitty okeyday witda brisky morning munchen.

361
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:23,250
結果砰的一聲
Den boom! Getten berry scared...

362
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,720
那個絕地武士救了我一命 我就跑來了
and grabben datJedi, and pow-- mesa here.

363
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:30,360
我現在怕得要命
- [ Chirps ] - Huh. Mesa getten berry, berry scared.

364
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,830
塔土印星到了
- That's it-- Tatooine.

365
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:39,800
城鎮在那兒
- There's a settlement.

366
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:43,230
降落在城外，別引起注意
Land near the outskirts. We don't want to attract attention.

367
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:04,190
超光速引擎毀了，一定得換新
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master. We'll need a new one.

368
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,730
事情更棘手
That'll complicate things. Be wary.

369
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:08,330
我感到原力受到干擾
- I sense a disturbance in the Force.

370
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,960
我也有感應
- I feel it also, Master.

371
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,040
別讓他們發出訊號
Don't let them send any transmissions.

372
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:20,440
這太陽會曬死人
This sun doen murder to mesa skin.

373
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,580
等等
[ Captain ] Wait!

374
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,250
等等
Wait.

375
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:31,010
陛下請你帶她的女侍一起去
Her Highness commands you to take her handmaiden with you.

376
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,250
我不想聽她的命令
No more commands from Her Highness today, Captain.

377
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,090
這座太空港很危險
The spaceport is not going to be pleasant.

378
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,470
皇后的願望，她對這星球好奇
The queen wishes it. She's curious about the planet.

379
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:45,090
這麼做不好
[ Sighs ] This is not a good idea.

380
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,540
緊跟著我
Stay close to me.

381
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,950
多半都是濾水廠
Moisture farms, for the most part.

382
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,660
有一些本地部落和清道夫
Some indigenous tribes and scavengers.

383
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,890
這種太空港通常都是龍蛇雜混
The few spaceports like this one are havens for those that don't wish to be found.

384
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,160
跟我們一樣
Like us.

385
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,170
情況不太妙
Dissen berry berry bad.

386
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,170
好噁心哦
- [ Sloshing Sound ] - Oh! Icky icky goo!

387
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,120
我們找小一點的店
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

388
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:45,400
你好
[ Bell Dinging ] [ Speaking Huttese ] Good day to you.

389
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,290
你要什麼？
What do you want?

390
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:51,530
我要J型327那卜號引擎
I need parts for a J-type 3 27 Nubian.

391
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,800
是了，那卜號引擎多得是
Ah, yes! Nubian. We have lots of that.

392
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,270
小鬼，給我過來
Boy, get in here now!

393
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,440
機械人有一切資料
- My droid has a readout of what I need. - [ Grunting ]

394
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,710
你怎麼這麼慢？
[ Speaking Huttese ] What took you so long?

395
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,880
我正在清洗扇葉開關
I was cleaning the fan switches.

396
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,590
幫我看店，我有買賣上門
Watch the store. I've got some selling to do.

397
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:17,230
我帶你到後面看你要的貨
So... let me take thee out back, huh? Ni you'll find what you need. [ Chuckling ]

398
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,360
什麼也別碰
- Hmm? - Don't touch anything.

399
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,240
你是天使嗎？
- Are you an angel?

400
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:32,710
什麼？
- What?

401
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,520
我聽飛行員提到天使的事
An angel. I heard the deep space pilots talk about them.

402
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,520
她們是宇宙最美的生物
They're the most beautiful creatures in the universe.

403
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,190
住在伊果月球上
They live on the moons of Iego, I think.

404
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,520
你真古靈精怪
You're a funny little boy.

405
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,460
怎麼知道這麼多事？
How do you know so much?

406
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:50,390
都是聽商人和飛行員說的
I listen to all the traders and star pilots who come through here.

407
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,960
我也是飛行員 有一天我要離開這兒
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday I'm gonna fly away from this place.

408
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,360
你是飛行員？
- You're a pilot?

409
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:58,900
這輩子都是
- Mm-hmm. All my life.

410
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,870
你在這裏多久了？
How long have you been here?

411
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,910
很小的時候就來了
Since I was very little.

412
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,840
三歲吧
Three, I think.

413
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,580
我跟我媽被賣給赫特族賈杜拉
My mom and I were sold to Gardulla the Hutt,

414
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,340
她又把我們輸給瓦頭
but she lost us betting on the Podraces.

415
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,880
你是個奴隸？
You're a slave?

416
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,480
我是個人，名叫安納金
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.

417
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,550
對不起
- I'm sorry.

418
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,390
我不太懂，這一切都很陌生
I don't fully understand. This is a strange place to me.

419
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,800
你去哪兒？
Where-- Wheres yousa goin?

420
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:37,270
按它的鼻子
- [ Blubbering ] I got ya. - Hey! - What? - Hit the nose.

421
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:44,570
T14型超光速引擎
A T-1 4 hyperdrive generator. Thee in luck.

422
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,950
算你走運，只有我才有
I'm the only one hereabouts who has one.

423
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:51,850
不過你買艘新船還比較便宜
But thee might as well buy a new ship. It would be cheaper, huh?

424
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:57,430
對了，你要怎麼付錢？
[ Chuckles ] Saying of which, how's thee gonna pay for all this, huh?

425
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,600
我有兩萬元共和幣
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

426
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,260
共和幣？
Republic credits?

427
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,600
共和幣不值錢 我要更值錢的東西
Republic credits are no good out here. I need something more real.

428
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:07,800
我沒有了，你要收共和幣
I don't have anything else, but credits will do fine.

429
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,470
我不收
- No, they won't.

430
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,610
你要收共和幣
- Credits will do fine.

431
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,540
我才不收
No, they won't!

432
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:17,650
別學絕地武士亂揮手
What, you think you're some kind of Jedi, waving your hand around like that?

433
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:18,980
我是鐸多利人
I'm a Toydarian.

434
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,220
不吃念力那套，我只愛錢
Mind tricks don't work on me. Only money.

435
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:25,480
沒有錢，一切免談
- No money, no parts, no deal. - [ Beeping ]

436
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,960
我保證別人沒有超光速引擎
And no one else has a T-1 4 hyperdrive, I promise you that.

437
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:44,400
幸好我會修東西才能活下來
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways if I wasn't so good at building things. Oh! Aw! Ooh! Uh!

438
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:48,040
我們走了，恰恰
- Ai, ai! Whoa, ai! - We're leaving.JarJar.

439
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,450
很高興認識你，安納金
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

440
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,980
我也很高興認識你
I was glad to meet you too.

441
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,930
外地人以為我們什麼都不懂
[ Speaking In Huttese ] Outlanders. They think we know nothing.

442
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,960
他們的人很好
They seemed nice to me.

443
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,930
打掃乾淨
Clean the racks.

444
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,410
就回家去吧
Then you can go home. Yippee!

445
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,640
船上什麼也沒有？
[ Qui-Gon ] And you're sure there's nothing left on board?

446
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,850
只有箱子和補給品
A few containers of supplies.

447
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,110
還有皇后的衣物
The queen's wardrobe, maybe, but not enough for you to barter with,

448
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,310
肯定換不了你要的引擎
not in the amount you're talking about.

449
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:34,460
一定有別的辦法
All right. I'm sure another solution will present itself.

450
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,720
我會再聯絡
I'll check back later.

451
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,630
我不去了
Noah gain! Noah gain.

452
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:41,390
這地方好恐怖
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

453
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,230
我們會被洗劫一空
Wesa be wobbed un crunched!

454
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:47,100
問題是，我們身無分文
Not likely. We have nothing of value. That's our problem.

455
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:59,410
好東西
Hmm? Ah, mooie-mooie.

456
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:04,020
你要付錢嗎？
Hey, hey! [ Speaking Huttese ] Are you going to pay for that?

457
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,630
七塊錢
It costs seven wupiupi.

458
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,970
這是你的嗎？
[ Speaking Huttese ] Is this yours?

459
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,470
你說我嗎？
Who, mesa? [ Gags ]

460
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,900
賽步霸，別亂來
[ Speaking Huttese ] Careful, Sebulba.

461
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,980
他是大人物
He's a big-time outlander.

462
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:34,340
你得留條小命跟我比賽
I'd hate to see you diced before we race again.

463
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:38,990
下次你這條小命就會保不住
Next time we race, boy, it will be the end of you.

464
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:41,860
你不是奴隸我早就宰了你
If you weren't a slave, I'd squash you now.

465
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,920
你得先把我買下來
Yeah, it'd be a pity if you had to pay for me.

466
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,860
你好
- Hi. - Hi there.

467
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,770
你朋友差點變成肉餅
Your buddy here was about to be turned into orange goo.

468
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,770
他惹毛了地頭蛇
He picked a fight with a Dug,

469
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,370
賽步霸是危險人物
an especially dangerous Dug called Sebulba.

470
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,110
我愛好和平，不想打架
Mesa haten crunchen. Das da las ting mesa want.

471
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:03,570
你差點惹上大麻煩
Nevertheless, the boy is right. You were heading into trouble.

472
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,210
謝了，小朋友
Thanks, my young friend.

473
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:11,850
我什麼也沒幹
But-- But-- - But mesa doen nutten! - [ Growls ]

474
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,930
他們會被大風沙延誤
This storm will slow them down.

475
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:22,820
情況很糟
- Looks pretty bad. - [ Beeps ]

476
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,900
來自家鄉的訊號
- Panaka. - [ Man ] Receiving a message from home.

477
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:27,700
我馬上來
- We'll be right there. - [ Beeps ]

478
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,450
你會喜歡這些
[ Anakin ] Here,you'll like these pallies.

479
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,310
拿著
- Here.

480
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,120
謝謝
- Thank you.

481
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,390
我這身老骨頭好酸
Oh, my bones are aching.

482
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:47,630
起風了，你最好快回家
Storm's coming up, Ani. You better get home quick.

483
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:49,750
你們有地方住嗎？
- Do you have shelter?

484
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,260
我們得回到飛船上
- We'll head back to our ship.

485
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:53,760
很遠嗎？   在城外
- Is it far? - It's on the outskirts.

486
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,500
你們趕不到的
You'll never reach the outskirts in time.

487
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:00,540
大風沙很危險
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.

488
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,830
來吧，到我家去
Come on. I'll take you to my place.

489
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,130
媽，我回來了
[ Exhaling ] Mom!

490
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,860
好溫暖的窩
- Mom, I'm home! -[JarJar ] Ahh, dissen cozy.

491
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:25,330
這些是我的朋友  你好
- These are my friends, Mom. - [JarJar] Hello.

492
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:26,860
我是金魁剛
- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.

493
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,990
想看我做的機械人嗎？
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

494
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,490
令郎好心請我們來住
Your son was kind enough to offer us shelter.

495
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,530
我給你看C3PO（嘻三屁歐）
- Come on. I'll show you 3PO. - Oh, mooie-mooie.

496
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,250
很棒吧，不過還沒完成
Isn't he great? He's not finished yet.

497
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,050
他是很棒
He's wonderful.

498
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:51,050
你喜歡他嗎？
- [ Beeping ] -[ Anakin ] You really like him?

499
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,320
他是幫媽媽忙的公關機械人
He's a protocol droid to help Mom.

500
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,050
你瞧
Watch.

501
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:59,830
人都在哪兒？
Oh. Oh. Uh-- Where is everybody?

502
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:08,910
我是C3PO，公關機械人
Oh, hello. I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.

503
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:11,710
我能效勞嗎？  他太完美了
How might I serve you?

504
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,070
完美
- He's perfect. - Oh. Perfect.

505
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:17,450
晚一點我帶你看我做的賽艇
When the storm is over, I'll show you my racer. I'm building a Podracer.

506
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:22,110
地板好像不太平
- [ Whistling ] - I'm not sure this floor is entirely stable.

507
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,710
我們好像不認識
Oh, hello. I don't believe we have been introduced.

508
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,920
阿土低土（R2D2），幸會了
R2-D2. A pleasure to meet you.

509
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:32,050
我是C3PO，公關機械人
I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.

510
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:37,900
你為什麼說我裸體？
I beg your pardon, but what do you mean, ''naked''?

511
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:43,240
我的零件走光了，老天啊
My parts are showing? My goodness! Oh!

512
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:52,450
人民死傷慘重，我們必須屈服
The death toll is catastrophic. We must bow to their wishes.

513
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,520
你們要跟我聯絡
You must contact me.

514
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:01,050
這是圈套，別發出任何訊號
It's a trick. Send no reply. Send no transmissions of any kind.

515
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,660
他們想找出我們的位置
It sounds like bait to establish a connection trace.

516
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:08,600
要是他們真的死傷慘重呢？
What if it is true, and the people are dying?

517
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,290
我們的時間不多
Either way, we're running out of time.

518
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,180
塔土印人口稀少
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

519
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:30,080
只要鎖定位置就找得到他們
If the trace was correct, I will find them quickly, Master.

520
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,280
先向絕地武士下手
Move against theJedi first.

521
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:36,830
然後就能逼皇后簽署條約
You will then have no difficulty in taking the queen to Naboo... to sign the treaty.

522
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:39,200
終於能和絕地武士對決
At last we will reveal ourselves to theJedi.

523
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,520
終於能夠報仇
At last we will have revenge.

524
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:47,270
好徒弟，你已學得絕技 他們打不過你
You have been well-trained, my young apprentice. They will be no match for you.

525
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:55,810
每個奴隸身上都裝了追蹤器
All slaves have a transmitter placed inside their bodies somewhere.

526
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:00,380
我想做掃瞄器找出來
I've been working on a scanner to try and locate mine.

527
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:01,890
只要企圖逃跑
- Any attempt to escape--

528
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:04,620
就會被炸成碎片 就會被炸成碎片
- And they blow you up! - Boom!

529
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:06,050
好可怕
- How wude!

530
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,230
銀河竟然還有奴隸
I can't believe there's still slavery in the galaxy.

531
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,890
共和國立法禁止奴隸
The Republic's antislavery laws--

532
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,100
共和國管不到這兒
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

533
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,800
我們得靠自己
We must survive on our own.

534
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,070
不好意思
[ Gulps ] Xcuse me.

535
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:22,810
誰看過雙引擎賽艇大賽？
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

536
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,670
我在麥洛斯塔看過
They have Podracing on Malastare.

537
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,910
速度很快，很危險
Very fast, very dangerous.

538
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,970
我是唯一能開賽艇的人類
I'm the only human who can do it.

539
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,150
你一定有絕地武士的本能
You must haveJedi reflexes if you race pods.

540
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,880
別這樣
- [ Gasps ] - Don't do that again.

541
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,290
你是絕地武士，對吧？
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

542
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:48,400
你怎麼知道？
What makes you think that?

543
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:49,930
我看到你的光劍
I saw your laser sword.

544
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,270
只有絕地武士才有
OnlyJedis carry that kind of weapon.

545
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,410
也許我殺了一個絕地武士
Perhaps I killed a Jedi and took it from him.

546
00:41:56,710 --> 00:42:00,040
不可能，誰也殺不了絕地武士
I don't think so. No one can kill a Jedi.

547
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,180
希望真是如此
I wish that were so.

548
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,210
我夢想成為絕地武士
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

549
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,810
回來解放所有奴隸
I came back here and freed all the slaves.

550
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,820
你來解放我們嗎？
- Have you come to free us?

551
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:11,550
不是的
- No, I'm afraid not.

552
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:15,250
一定是，要不然你來幹麼？
I think you have. Why else would you be here?

553
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,630
什麼事都瞞不了你
I can see there's no fooling you, Anakin.

554
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,230
我們必須趕到科魯斯根星
We're on our way to Coruscant, the central system in the Republic,

555
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,970
有重要任務
on a very important mission.

556
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,940
你們怎麼會跑來這兒？
How did you end up out here in the outer rim?

557
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:35,910
我們的飛船受損，修好才能走
Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair it.

558
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,450
讓我來，我什麼都會修
I can help.

559
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:42,220
我相信
- I can fix anything. -[ Qui-Gon ] I believe you can.

560
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:45,150
不過我們先得買到需要的零件
But first we must acquire the parts we need.

561
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,790
可是咱們身無分文
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

562
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:51,590
這些店東一定有弱點
These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.

563
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,920
賭博
Gambling.

564
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:56,300
為了比賽他們什麼都肯賭
Everything here revolves around betting on those awful races.

565
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,390
賽艇大賽
Podracing.

566
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,470
我能利用他們的貪心
Greed can be a powerful ally.

567
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:03,540
我打造的賽艇最快
I built a racer. It's the fastest ever.

568
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,140
明天的奔塔之夜有賽艇大賽
There's a big race tomorrow on Boonta Eve.

569
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,610
你可以用我的賽艇
- You could enter my pod.

570
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:08,740
安納金
-[ Mother ] Anakin!

571
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,710
瓦頭不會答應
- Watto won't let you.

572
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,310
他不知道我有賽艇
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

573
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:16,260
就說是你的，再讓我參賽
You could make him think it was yours... and get him to let me pilot it for you.

574
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:20,190
瓦頭逼你參賽我都擔心得要死
I don't want you to race. It's awful. I die every time Watto makes you do it.

575
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,550
媽，可是我很想
But, Mom, I love it.

576
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:26,460
獎金可以幫他們買零件
The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need.

577
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:28,530
安納金
Anakin.

578
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:30,560
你媽說得對
Your mother's right.

579
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:35,070
有什麼人能幫助我們？
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who can help us?

580
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,410
沒有
No.

581
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:47,720
你老說這宇宙的人都太自私
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this universe is nobody helps each other.

582
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:55,690
金魁剛不想讓他冒險
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger.

583
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:57,390
我們另外想辦法
We'll find some other way.

584
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:02,670
沒有別的辦法
No. There is no other way.

585
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:06,740
我不放心，不過他能幫你們
I may not like it, but he can help you.

586
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:09,630
他注定要幫你們
He was meant to help you.

587
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,730
你確定嗎？
Are you sure about this?

588
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,700
把命運交給一個陌生男孩？
Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know?

589
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:29,570
皇后不會同意
The queen will not approve.

590
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,510
不必讓她知道
The queen doesn't need to know.

591
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,650
我不同意
Well, I don't approve.

592
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:38,480
那小鬼說你要讓他參賽
-[ Bell Dings ] - The boy tells me you want to sponsor him in the race.

593
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:40,120
怎麼可能？
How can you do this?

594
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,180
你的共和幣不管用
Not on the Republic credits, I think, huh?

595
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,120
我用我的飛船做抵押
My ship will be the entry fee.

596
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:51,220
不錯嘛，那卜號
Oh, not bad! Not bad, huh? A Nubian, huh?

597
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,260
狀況很好，只缺一具引擎
It's in good order, except for the parts I need.

598
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:56,170
小鬼要開什麼？
What would the boy ride?

599
00:44:56,270 --> 00:45:00,930
上次他撞爛我的賽艇 得花時間修好
He smashed up my pod in the last race. It will take some long time to fix it.

600
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:03,570
不是我的錯
It wasn't my fault, really.

601
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,140
賽步霸偷襲我
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

602
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:08,750
是我救了那艘賽艇
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

603
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:12,240
這倒是沒錯
Mmm. That you did, huh. [ Chuckling ]

604
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:15,150
這小鬼的確很高竿
The boy's good. No doubts there, huh?

605
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:19,410
我贏來一艘最快的賽艇
I have acquired a pod in a game of chance, the fastest ever built.

606
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:24,790
希望沒把我認識的人殺了
I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it, huh?

607
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,600
你提供賽艇和參賽費
So, you supply the pod and the entry fee,

608
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:35,910
我提供那小鬼，二一添作五
and I supply the boy. We split the winnings, um, 50-50, I think, huh?

609
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:39,840
這樣的話你得拿出參賽費
If it's going to be 50-50, I suggest you front the cash for the entry.

610
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,140
要是我們贏
If we win,

611
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:46,180
我只要零件，獎金都歸你
you keep all the winnings, minus the cost of the parts I need.

612
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:48,120
要是我們輸
And if we lose,

613
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:50,090
我的飛船就歸你
you keep my ship.

614
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,920
不管怎樣你都贏
Either way, you win.

615
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:00,760
一言為定
Deal!

616
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,800
我覺得你朋友很笨
[ Speaking Huttese ] Your friend is a foolish one, methinks.

617
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,690
這計劃也許會失敗
What if this plan fails, Master?

618
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:24,160
我們會一直被困在這兒
We could be stuck here a very long time.

619
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,860
向別人求助太冒險
Well, it's too dangerous to call for help,

620
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:29,920
沒引擎的飛船哪兒都去不了
and a ship without a power supply isn't going to get us anywhere.

621
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:34,420
這孩子很特別
there's something about this boy.

622
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,000
你應該以令郎為榮
You should be very proud of your son.

623
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,480
他沒想到獎賞
He gives without any thought of reward.

624
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:49,850
他一點也不貪心，他擁有...
Well, he knows nothing of greed.

625
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:53,780
他擁有特殊的力量
- He has a-- - He has special powers.

626
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:56,450
是的
Yes.

627
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,320
他能夠預知未來
He can see things before they happen.

628
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:02,520
所以反應才這麼敏捷
That's why he appears to have such quick reflexes.

629
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,090
像一個絕地武士
It's a Jedi trait.

630
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:06,490
他不該當個奴隸
-He deserves better than a slave's life. -Why, certainly.

631
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:10,830
如果他在共和國早就被發掘了
Had he been born in the Republic, we would have identified him early.

632
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:16,170
他身上的原力異常強大
The Force is unusually strong with him. That much is clear.

633
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:18,600
他父親是誰？
Who was his father?

634
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:23,110
他沒有父親
There was no father.

635
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:28,380
我一個人懷孕，撫養他長大
I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him.

636
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,950
我不會解釋怎麼回事
I can't explain what happened.

637
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:34,820
你能幫助他嗎？
Can you help him?

638
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,050
不知道
I don't know.

639
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,230
我不是來解放奴隸
I didn't actually come here to free slaves.

640
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:58,410
真的修護機械人耶
-[ R2-D2 Beeping ] - Wow, a real astro droid.

641
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:02,180
你好幸運哦
- How did you get so lucky?

642
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:03,910
不只是這樣
- That isn't the half of it.

643
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:06,380
我要參加明天的賽艇大賽
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.

644
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:07,120
什麼？
- What?

645
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:08,820
開這玩意？
With this?

646
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:11,720
安納，別鬧了
[ Speaking Alien Language ] You're such a joker, Ani.

647
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,020
你花了好幾年打造
- You've been working on that thing for years. - It's never gonna run.

648
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:17,530
一定跑不了  我們去玩球
Come on. Let's go and play ball.

649
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:21,230
你再做白日夢就會被撞扁
Keep racing, Ani. You're gonna be bug squash.

650
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:31,810
恰恰，遠離那道電流
Hey,JarJar. - [ Gasps ] - Keep away from those energy binders.

651
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,390
要是觸電就會麻痹很久
If your hand gets caught in the beam, it's gonna go numb for hours.

652
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:36,880
好啦
Sorry. Okay.

653
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,160
我的舌頭麻了
[ Muffled ] My tongue is fat.

654
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:46,530
我有大舌頭，螺絲起子呢？
My tongue-- Wrench.

655
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:49,190
那兒
Where is da wrench? Oh, dare it is.

656
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,200
安納，我被卡住了
Uh, Ani, I'm stuck. Ani--

657
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:59,300
我覺得恰恰有一點奇怪
You know, I find thatJarJar creature to be a little odd.

658
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:03,880
你不知道能不能跑
You don't even know if this thing's gonna run.

659
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:04,740
一定能
- It will. - I think it's time we found out.

660
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:08,020
試試看，用這個試試
- Here, use this power charge. - Yes, sir!

661
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,420
好的   小奇，讓開
Come on, Kitster. Let's move away.

662
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,020
我的嘴巴
[ Muffled ] My-- My mouth.

663
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,490
我被卡住了
Ani, I'm stuck. [ Babbling ]

664
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,920
我的舌頭麻了
Uh, hey. My tongue is fat. Ani!

665
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:24,660
你說得對，他很古怪
You're quite right. He's very odd indeed.

666
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:28,770
謝謝你，來吧
Oh. Th-- Thank you.

667
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:30,770
走
Go.

668
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:48,890
成功了，成功了
It's working! It's working!

669
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,900
別動，讓我擦乾淨
Stay still, Ani. Let me clean this cut.

670
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:06,110
好多行星，都有人住嗎？
There's so many. Do they all have a system of planets?

671
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:07,910
大多數都有
Most of them.

672
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,210
有人去過每一顆星球嗎？
Has anyone been to 'em all?

673
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:13,140
應該沒有
[ Chuckles ] Not likely.

674
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,980
我要當第一個，走遍每個星球
I wanna be the first one to see 'em all.

675
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:20,020
該睡覺了
-[ Mother ] Ani, bedtime! - Ow!

676
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:22,620
好了，沒事了
There we are. Good as new.

677
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:25,430
安納，我不想再說一遍
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

678
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:27,200
你在做什麼？
- What are you doing?

679
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:29,460
替你驗血，免得受感染
- Checking your blood for infections.

680
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:32,900
去睡吧，明天有得忙了
Go on. You have a big day tomorrow.

681
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:34,730
好好睡吧
Sleep well, Ani.

682
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,140
歐比王   是，師父
- Obi-Wan? - Yes, Master?

683
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,780
我要你驗一下血
I need an analysis of this blood sample I'm sending you.

684
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:44,480
等一下
- Wait a minute. - [ Beeping ]

685
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,210
有多少迷地原蟲？
I need a midi-chlorian count.

686
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:55,930
指數太高了，超過兩萬點
The reading is off the chart. Over 20,000.

687
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,430
連尤達大師都沒這麼多
Even Master Yoda doesn't have a midi-chlorian count that high.

688
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:01,130
絕地武士也沒有
NoJedi has.

689
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:02,990
這代表什麼？
What does that mean?

690
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,760
我不確定
I'm not sure.

691
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:19,170
比賽結束就給我看飛船
I wanna see your spaceship the moment the race is over.

692
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,800
你要有點耐心
Patience, my blue friend. You'll have your winnings before the suns set.

693
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:25,280
等你領到獎金我們就會離開
And we'll be far away from here.

694
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:28,940
除非你把飛船輸給我
Not if your ship belongs to me, I think, huh?

695
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:33,210
我警告你，別搞鬼
[ Laughs ] I warn you, no funny business.

696
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:34,950
你不認為安納金會贏
- You don't think Anakin can win? - Don't get me wrong, no.

697
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:39,000
別想歪，我對他有信心
I have great faith in the boy.

698
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,030
他真的很高竿
He's a credit to your race,

699
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:44,730
不過我覺得賽步霸會贏
but, uh, Sebulba there is going to win, I think.

700
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:47,940
糟糕
Oh, no!

701
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,110
為什麼？
Why do you think that?

702
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,240
他每次都贏
He always wins! [ Laughing ]

703
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,580
我在他身上下了重注
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

704
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:03,620
我跟你賭了
- I'll take that bet.

705
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:05,040
什麼？
- You what?

706
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:09,490
我用那艘新的賽艇賭
I'll wager my new racing pod against, say,

707
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,330
那孩子和他母親
the boy and his mother.

708
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:15,120
一艘賽艇值不了兩個奴隸
No pod is worth two slaves, not by a long shot.

709
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:17,830
我賭那孩子
The boy, then.

710
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:26,580
讓命運決定吧
We'll let fate decide, huh?

711
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:30,070
我有一粒命運骰
I just happen to have a chance cube here.

712
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:33,390
藍色放走男孩，紅色
Blue, it's the boy.

713
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:37,580
就放走他母親
Red, uh... his mother.

714
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:50,030
你贏了骰子
You won this small toss, outlander,

715
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:51,930
但贏不了比賽
but you won't win the race!

716
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,660
反正你輸定了
So it makes little difference!

717
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:02,280
別讓他再賭下去
[ Watto Speaking Huttese ]

718
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:10,280
否則他連自己都會輸給我
Better stop your friend's betting, or I'll end up owning him too.

719
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:14,150
那是什麼意思？
- What'd he mean by that? - I'll tell you later.

720
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:17,320
待會再說，早安
Good morning.

721
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:21,430
太空旅行聽起來很危險
-[ Bleeping ] - Oh, my. Space travel sounds rather perilous.

722
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:27,570
我絕對不會坐上那些太空船
I can assure you, they will never get me onto one of those dreadful starships.

723
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:31,570
棒呆了，這次你一定會成功
This is so wizard, Ani. I'm sure you'll do it this time.

724
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,300
什麼事？
- Do what?

725
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:35,070
完成比賽呀
- Finish the race, of course.

726
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:37,350
你沒贏過嗎？
- You've never won a race?

727
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:40,020
沒有吧
- Well, not exactly.

728
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:42,080
也沒跑完全程？
Not even finished?

729
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:44,350
小奇說得對，這次沒問題
Kitster's right. I will this time.

730
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:46,280
當然了
Of course you will.

731
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:16,610
比賽馬上開始
[ Continues ] ...Podracers.

732
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,720
是的，一點也沒錯
That's absolutely right.

733
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:24,060
觀眾來自宇宙各個角落
And a big turnout here from all corners of the outer rim territories.

734
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,790
參賽者正要走到起點
I see the contestants are making their way out onto the starting grid.

735
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:32,560
我看到土丹星來的班貴
[ Announcer #2 ] I see Ben Quadinaros from the Tund System.

736
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,540
兩度贏家羅包勒
[ Announcer #2 ] Two-time winner Boles Roor.

737
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:44,750
賽步霸
Sebulba!

738
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:58,420
站在前排中央的...
And in the front row, nearside pole position,

739
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:00,560
馬哈尼
Mawhonic!

740
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:03,790
熱烈歡迎
- [ Shouts ] -A hearty hello...

741
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:07,630
赫力格和他的大黃蜂9號
to Clegg Holdfast and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!

742
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:13,630
再次參賽的波達
And back again, it's the mighty Dud Bolt...

743
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:18,340
和他的動力賽艇 327維普特號
with that incredible racing machine, the Vulptereen 3 2 7.

744
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:24,090
希望今天贏得冠軍的歐曼迪
-And hoping for a big win today, - [Jabbering ]

745
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:28,690
和他的機器人維修隊
Ody Mandrell, with his record-setting pit droid team.

746
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:39,260
最後的參賽者安納金天行者
And a late entry, young Anakin Skywalker, -a local boy. - [ Cheering ]

747
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:43,000
參賽者的旗幟一一出現在跑道
I see the flags are moving out onto the track.

748
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,090
臭死了
[ Blubbering ] Pee yousa!

749
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:04,820
小心
Be safe.

750
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:08,030
我會的，媽，我保證
I will, Mom. I promise.

751
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:26,110
這次你活不了
[ Speaking In Huttese ] You won't walk away from this one,

752
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,180
死奴隸
you slave scum.

753
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:31,580
你想得美，臭頭
Don't count on it, slime ball.

754
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,990
你會死得很難看
You're bantha fodder!

755
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,320
準備好了嗎？
- You all set, Ani? - Yep.

756
00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:41,830
很好
- Right. - Whoa!

757
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,200
記住，專心一意
Remember, concentrate on the moment.

758
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:53,330
用感覺，別去想，憑你的直覺
Feel, don't think. Use your instincts.

759
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:54,870
我會的
I will.

760
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:57,140
願原力與你同在
May the Force be with you.

761
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,880
賈霸
Jabba the Hutt. [ Ululating ]

762
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:22,230
歡迎大家
[ Speaking Huttese ] Welcome.

763
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:26,700
開始吧
Begin the race!

764
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,720
他們要清除跑道
[ Announcer #2 ] Hey, it looks like they're clearing the grid.

765
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:44,160
他緊張嗎？   他很好
- Is he nervous? - He's fine.

766
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:48,790
你們太魯莽了，皇后...
You Jedi are far too reckless. The queen is not--

767
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,600
皇后相信我的判斷
The queen trusts my judgment, young handmaiden.

768
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:52,890
你也應該相信
You should too.

769
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:55,710
你太武斷了
You assume too much.

770
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,100
啟動引擎
[ Announcer #2 ] Start your engines.

771
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:42,050
一定會很慘，我不敢看
Oh, dissen gonna be messy. Me no watch'n!

772
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,170
糟糕
Oh, no! No!

773
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,350
慢著，小天行者動不了
[ Chuckles ] Wait. Little Skywalker has stalled.

774
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:26,760
看來班貴也有麻煩
[ Announcer #2 ] Well, it looks like Quadinaros is having engine trouble also.

775
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:29,930
加油，安納
- Come on, Ani! - [ Engine Clicking, Whirring ]

776
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:37,970
天行者衝出去了
-[ Announcer #2 ] -And there goes Skywalker!

777
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,500
安納，加油
- Go, Ani, go!

778
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,770
他想迎頭趕上很困難
He will be hard-pressed to catch up with the leaders.

779
01:01:55,790 --> 01:02:00,350
突斯肯游擊隊在等著他們
Looks like a few Tusken Raiders are camped out on the canyon dune turn.

780
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:10,090
什麼破東西
Doowat macroon!

781
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:15,970
班貴的雙引擎毀了
Ooh, there goes Quadinaros' power coupling.

782
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,070
哦  不
Oh, no!

783
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,470
安納金主人呢？
- Where is Master Anakin? - [ Beeping ]

784
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:57,570
他來了
Look. Here he comes.

785
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:03,420
天行者正迎頭趕上
[ Announcer #2 ] It looks like Skywalker is moving up in the field.

786
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:16,770
他還得繞兩圈嗎？天啊
- [ Beeping ] - He has to complete two more circuits? Oh, dear.

787
01:04:24,370 --> 01:04:26,230
天行者失去控制打轉
Skywalker's spinning out of control!

788
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:28,130
不管是從哪兒來，一定很痛
Oh, I don't care what universe you're from. That's gotta hurt!

789
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:36,800
他來了
Here he comes! Owoo!

790
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:40,070
只剩最後一圈，賽步霸領先
[ Announcer #2 ] At the start of the final lap, Sebulba's in the lead,

791
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:42,270
天行者緊跟在後
followed closely by Skywalker!

792
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,850
加油  安
Go, Ani!

793
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:13,140
天行者被逼到旁邊
-[ Spectators Gasping ] - Skywalker's been forced onto the service ramp!

794
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:36,090
天行者領先了
- It's Skywalker! - Sebulba!

795
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:43,130
不可思議，他巧妙地回到跑道
Amazing! A quick control thrust, and he's back on course!

796
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:44,400
他撞毀了嗎？
Did he crash-ed?

797
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,810
天行者有麻煩，賽步霸領先
Skywalker's in trouble! Sebulba takes the lead!

798
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:24,470
他正趕上賽步霸
- He's catching Sebulba! - Inkabunga!

799
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:27,070
小心點，安納
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

800
01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:00,840
這小鬼發瘋了
- That little human being is out of his mind. - Punda tah punda!

801
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:02,140
他們並駕齊驅
- They're side by side! - Bangu du bangu!

802
01:09:35,610 --> 01:09:38,740
我不敢相信
- [ Beeping ] - I can't believe it.

803
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,040
觀眾為之瘋狂
The crowds are going nuts!

804
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:54,790
媽，我贏了
Mom, I did it! Yeah!

805
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:08,240
幹得好
[JarJar] Good going, Ani!

806
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:14,450
你救了我們
We owe you everything, Ani.

807
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,480
太好了
It's so wonderful, Ani.

808
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,060
你為奴隸帶來希望
You have brought hope to those who have none.

809
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:25,190
我以你為榮
I'm so very proud of you.

810
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:36,600
你
You.

811
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,730
你騙了我
You swindled me!

812
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:43,470
你早就知道那小鬼會贏
You knew the boy was going to win. Somehow you knew it.

813
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:45,380
我失去一切
I lost everything.

814
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:48,470
只要賭博就會輸
Whenever you gamble, my friend, eventually you'll lose.

815
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:51,290
把零件帶到停機棚
Bring the parts to the main hangar.

816
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:54,760
我會到店裏把那小孩帶走
I'll come by your shop later on so you can release the boy.

817
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:58,220
不行，這不公平
You can't have him. It wasn't a fair bet.

818
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:03,420
你想跟赫特族理論嗎？
- Would you like to discuss it with the Hutts? -[ Grumbles ]

819
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:06,290
他們一定有辦法裁決
I'm sure they can settle this.

820
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:09,970
把他帶走吧
Take him.

821
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:22,520
零件拿到了，我要再回去
Well, we have all the essential parts we need.

822
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:25,650
我還有點事
I'm going back. Some unfinished business. I won't be long.

823
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:29,120
我猜你又要帶來另一個人
Why do I sense we've picked up another pathetic life-form?

824
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:33,090
零件是那小孩贏來的
It's the boy who's responsible for getting us these parts.

825
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:35,490
把超光速引擎裝好
Get this hyperdrive generator installed.

826
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,330
是，師父，馬上就好
Yes, Master. That shouldn't take long.

827
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:39,100
走吧
- Come on. Hup! -[ Creature Grunts ]

828
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:47,170
這是你的
Hey. These are yours.

829
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:53,410
我們把賽艇賣掉有好多錢哦
Mom, we sold the pod!

830
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:55,910
太好了，安納
- Look at all the money we have! - My goodness!

831
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:58,810
他自由了
- But that's so wonderful, Ani. -And he has been freed.

832
01:11:58,950 --> 01:11:59,710
什麼？
- What?

833
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:01,310
你不再是奴隸
- You're no longer a slave.

834
01:12:03,890 --> 01:12:05,350
你聽到了嗎？
Did you hear that?

835
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,660
你可以實現夢想了
Now you can make your dreams come true, Ani.

836
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:10,650
你自由了
You are free.

837
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:16,490
你要帶他走
Will you take him with you?

838
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:18,430
讓他當絕地武士
- Is he to become a Jedi? - Yes.

839
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:20,940
是的，我們會碰面
Our meeting was not a coincidence.

840
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:23,430
絕對不是意外
Nothing happens by accident.

841
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:27,140
我可以跟你坐太空船嗎？
You mean I get to come with you in your starship?

842
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:28,510
安納金
Anakin,

843
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:33,780
絕地武士的訓練很困難
training to become a Jedi is not an easy challenge,

844
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:36,780
就算成功也很辛苦
and even if you succeed, it's a hard life.

845
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:40,160
我想去，這是我的夢想
But I wanna go. It's what I've always dreamed of doing.

846
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,750
媽，我能去嗎？
Can I go, Mom?

847
01:12:44,290 --> 01:12:45,230
安納金
Anakin,

848
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:51,490
這是你的機會，你必須自己決定
this path has been placed before you. The choice is yours alone.

849
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:56,900
我想要去
I wanna do it.

850
01:12:59,510 --> 01:13:03,000
那就去收拾，時間不多
Then pack your things. We haven't much time. Yippee!

851
01:13:08,690 --> 01:13:09,810
媽媽呢？
What about Mom?

852
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:14,890
她也自由嗎？
Is she free too?

853
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:18,550
我很想救她，瓦頭不肯
I tried to free your mother, Ani, but Watto wouldn't have it.

854
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,800
你要跟我們來，對吧？
You're coming with us, aren't you, Mom?

855
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:32,910
我得留下來，我命該如此
Son, my place is here. My future is here.

856
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:35,410
你要學會割捨
It is time for you to let go.

857
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,940
我不想要改變
I don't want things to change.

858
01:13:39,050 --> 01:13:41,240
你不能抗拒改變
But you can't stop the change...

859
01:13:41,490 --> 01:13:44,220
你也不能阻止太陽下山
any more than you can stop the suns from setting.

860
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:46,820
我愛你
Oh, I love you.

861
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:55,100
快去吧
Now hurry.

862
01:14:00,670 --> 01:14:01,600
謝謝你
Thank you.

863
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:04,900
我保證一定會照顧他
I'll watch after him. You have my word.

864
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:08,280
你不會有事吧？
Will you be all right?

865
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,250
你好，安納金主人
Hello, Master Anakin.

866
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:23,120
我自由了，我要去坐太空船
Well, 3PO, I've been freed... and I'm going away in a starship.

867
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:25,960
我是你做的，請你保重
Master Anakin, you are my maker and I wish you well.

868
01:14:26,330 --> 01:14:30,290
不過我希望你能把我完成
However, I should prefer it if I were a little more completed.

869
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:33,490
抱歉我沒辦法把你做完
I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish you,

870
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,730
給你穿衣服
3PO, give you coverings and all.

871
01:14:36,210 --> 01:14:39,770
我會想念你，你是好夥伴
I'm gonna miss working on you. You've been a great pal.

872
01:14:40,410 --> 01:14:42,740
我會叫媽別把你賣掉
I'll make sure Mom doesn't sell you or anything.

873
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:44,650
把我賣掉？
Sell me?

874
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:45,880
再見
Bye.

875
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,380
天啊
Oh, my.

876
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:14,770
我不能丟下你一個人不管
I can't do it, Mom. I just can't do it.

877
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:16,240
安納
Ani.

878
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:20,980
我能再見到你嗎？
Will I ever see you again?

879
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:24,410
你的心是怎麼想的？
What does your heart tell you?

880
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:28,220
我當然希望
I hope so.

881
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:33,100
但是我又非走不可
Yes. I guess.

882
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:36,000
那麼我們就會再見面
Then we will see each other again.

883
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:44,070
我會回來救你，我保證
I will come back and free you, Mom. I promise.

884
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:55,280
勇敢點
Now, be brave...

885
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:57,710
不要回頭
and don't look back.

886
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,320
不要留戀過去
Don't look back.

887
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:47,260
等等，我累了
- Qui-Gon, sir, wait! I'm tired!

888
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:48,200
快趴下
- Anakin! Drop!

889
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:51,570
快走
Go!

890
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:53,570
叫他們起飛
Tell them to take off!

891
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:08,490
金魁剛有麻煩
Qui-Gon's in trouble.

892
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:10,990
起飛
Take off.

893
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,560
那兒，飛低點
Over there. Fly low.

894
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:36,680
你沒事吧？
Are you all right?

895
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:38,310
沒事
I think so.

896
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:39,590
那是什麼？
What was it?

897
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,260
我不確定
I'm not sure,

898
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:44,350
不過他會絕地武藝
but it was well-trained in theJedi arts.

899
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:47,190
我猜他來抓皇后
- [ Beeps ] - My guess is it was after the queen.

900
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:49,100
我們該怎麼辦？
What are we gonna do about it?

901
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,230
有點耐心
We shall be patient.

902
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:54,700
安納金天行者
Anakin Skywalker, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

903
01:17:55,670 --> 01:17:59,000
這是歐比王肯諾比
- Hi. -[ R2-D2 Beeping ]

904
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:02,040
你也是絕地武士？幸會了
You're a Jedi too? Pleased to meet you.

905
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:13,350
皇后不見蹤影，百姓在挨餓
Your queen is lost, your people are starving,

906
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:17,830
你很快會跟他們一起送死
and you, Governor, are going to die... much sooner than your people, I'm afraid.

907
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:20,060
侵略行動無效
This invasion will gain you nothing.

908
01:18:20,430 --> 01:18:23,400
這是人民作主的民主政府
We're a democracy. The people have decided.

909
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:25,290
把他帶走
Take him away.

910
01:18:28,910 --> 01:18:34,140
軍隊在搜索傳說的水底城市
My troops are in position to begin searching the swamps... for these rumored underwater villages.

911
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:36,200
他們躲不了多久
They will not stay hidden for long.

912
01:18:48,130 --> 01:18:50,360
人民死傷慘重
The death toll is catastrophic.

913
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:55,530
我們必須屈服，快跟我聯絡
We must bow to their wishes. You must contact me.

914
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:11,110
你還好吧？
You all right?

915
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:14,340
好冷
It's very cold.

916
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,730
你來自炎熱的星球
You come from a warm planet, Ani.

917
01:19:25,530 --> 01:19:27,430
我都有點受不了
A little too warm for my taste.

918
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:29,060
外太空很冷
Space is cold.

919
01:19:30,430 --> 01:19:31,900
你好像很悲傷
You seem sad.

920
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:35,230
皇后很擔心
The queen is worried.

921
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:38,200
她的人民在受苦受難
Her people are suffering, dying.

922
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:41,640
她必須說服議會出面干涉
She must convince the senate to intervene, or...

923
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:45,240
我不確定能成功
I'm not sure what'll happen.

924
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:48,750
我為你做的
I made this for you...

925
01:19:51,150 --> 01:19:52,490
希望你能記得我
so you'd remember me.

926
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:55,920
我用茄柏木塊刻的
I carved it out of a japor snippet.

927
01:19:56,590 --> 01:19:58,030
會為你帶來好運
It'll bring you good fortune.

928
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:00,120
好漂亮
It's beautiful.

929
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:03,330
我一定會記得你
But I don't need this to remember you by.

930
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:10,000
到了首都會有很多改變
Many things will change when we reach the capital, Ani,

931
01:20:10,910 --> 01:20:13,070
不過我會一直關心你
but my caring for you will remain.

932
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:18,950
我也關心你，只是...
I care for you, too, only I--

933
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:20,880
你想念你媽
Miss your mother.

934
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:43,830
科魯斯根星是座龐大城市
Coruscant. The entire planet is one big city.

935
01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:45,770
那是議長的飛船
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.

936
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:49,110
你們看，白議員在等我們
And look over there. Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.

937
01:21:18,910 --> 01:21:21,640
陛下，很高興你還活著
It is a great gift to see you alive, Your Majesty.

938
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:24,970
通訊中斷讓我們非常擔憂
With the communications breakdown, we've been very concerned.

939
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,350
我急著想聽你的消息
I'm anxious to hear your report on the situation.

940
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:30,280
這是最高議長魏倫
May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.

941
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:31,750
陛下，歡迎
Welcome, Your Highness.

942
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,320
很榮幸終於見到你
It's an honor to finally meet you in person.

943
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:36,120
謝謝你，議長
Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.

944
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:40,390
大家都對這件事憂心忡忡
I must relay to you how distressed everyone is over the current situation.

945
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,130
我召開緊急會議聽你的訴求
I've called for a special session of the senate to hear your position.

946
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,600
謝謝你的關心，議長
I'm grateful for your concern, Chancellor.

947
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:52,070
議程有些爭議 但我相信能克服
There is a question of procedure, but I'm confident we can overcome it.

948
01:21:52,910 --> 01:21:54,930
我必須趕到絕地議會
I must speak with theJedi Council immediately.

949
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:57,810
情況變得很複雜
The situation has become much more complicated.

950
01:22:03,850 --> 01:22:05,650
安納，走吧
Ani, come on.

951
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:20,030
我覺得皇后人蠻好的
The queen's a bein' grossly nice, mesa tinks.

952
01:22:21,070 --> 01:22:22,900
長得不錯
Pitty hot.

953
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:54,090
只有政治考量，沒有正義可言
[ Palpatine ] There is no civility, only politics.

954
01:22:55,370 --> 01:22:58,830
共和國已經大不如前
The Republic is not what it once was.

955
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:04,380
貪得無厭的議員成天爭吵不休
The senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates.

956
01:23:05,150 --> 01:23:08,680
根本就罔顧人民福祉
There is no interest... in the common good.

957
01:23:09,690 --> 01:23:14,350
老實說，議會 絕不會阻止侵略行動
I must be frank, Your Majesty. There is little chance the senate will act on the invasion.

958
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:16,950
魏倫議長認為有希望
Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope.

959
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:18,760
恕我直言
If I may say so, Your Majesty,

960
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:21,520
議長沒有實權
the chancellor has little real power.

961
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:25,090
他被貪污腐敗的流言拖累
He is mired by baseless accusations of corruption.

962
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:27,660
官僚才有權力
- The bureaucrats are in charge now.

963
01:23:27,870 --> 01:23:28,960
我們有何選擇？
- What options have we?

964
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:35,140
要求議會選出更強勢的議長
Our best choice would be to push for the election... of a stronger supreme chancellor,

965
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:37,210
能夠約束官僚
one who could control the bureaucrats...

966
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:39,180
伸張正義
and give us justice.

967
01:23:40,150 --> 01:23:45,690
你可以對魏倫投下不信任票
You could call for a vote of no confidence... in Chancellor Valorum.

968
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:48,080
他一直支持我們
He has been our strongest supporter.

969
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:53,250
要不然，就一狀告上法庭
Our only other choice would be to submit a plea to the courts.

970
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:57,000
那得花更多的時間
The courts take even longer to decide things than the senate.

971
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:00,000
老百姓死傷慘重
Our people are dying, Senator.

972
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:03,800
我們必須盡快阻止貿易聯邦
We must do something quickly to stop the Federation.

973
01:24:03,970 --> 01:24:06,530
請你面對事實
To be realistic, Your Majesty,

974
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:11,180
我們目前得接受他們的統治
I think we're going to have to accept Federation control for the time being.

975
01:24:13,950 --> 01:24:15,750
我絕對不能接受
That is something I cannot do.

976
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:25,450
他身負絕地武藝
He was trained in theJedi arts.

977
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:29,500
我猜他是一名西斯武士
My only conclusion can be that it was a Sith lord.

978
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:30,790
不可能
Impossible.

979
01:24:31,330 --> 01:24:33,770
西斯人絕種了一千年
The Sith have been extinct for a millennium.

980
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:38,070
如果他們回來我們一定知道
I do not believe the Sith could have returned without us knowing.

981
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:41,210
很難察覺黑暗的一面
Ah, hard to see, the dark side is.

982
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:44,280
我們得盡全力解開這個謎
We will use all our resources to unravel this mystery.

983
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:47,720
揭開神秘武士的身份
We will discover the identity of your attacker.

984
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:49,420
願原力與你同在
May the Force be with you.

985
01:24:53,690 --> 01:24:54,920
金師父
[ Yoda ] Master Qui-Gon.

986
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:57,650
你還有話要說？
More to say have you?

987
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:01,360
請容我發言，大師
With your permission, my master,

988
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,830
我發現了原力磁場
I have encountered a vergence in the Force.

989
01:25:07,370 --> 01:25:09,270
原力磁場？
A vergence, you say?

990
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:11,530
在一個人的身上？
Located around a person?

991
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:12,600
一個小男孩
A boy.

992
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:17,440
他的細胞含有驚人的迷地原蟲
His cells have the highest concentration of midi-chlorians I have seen in a life-form.

993
01:25:17,950 --> 01:25:20,440
也許是原蟲直接受孕而生
It is possible he was conceived by the midi-chlorians.

994
01:25:22,390 --> 01:25:27,060
預言說有人將為原力帶來平衡
You refer to the prophecy... of the one who will bring balance to the Force.

995
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:28,920
你相信就是這男孩？
You believe it's this boy?

996
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:31,580
我不敢說   不過你相信是
- I don't presume to-- -[ Yoda ] But you do.

997
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:34,290
把你的想法說出來
Revealed your opinion is.

998
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:36,530
請你們讓他接受測驗
I request the boy be tested, Master.

999
01:25:36,770 --> 01:25:42,000
你要讓他成為絕地武士？
Oh? Trained as a Jedi you request for him, hmm?

1000
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:46,870
我相信是原力讓我找到他
Finding him was the will of the Force. I have no doubt of that.

1001
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:55,240
把他帶來吧
Bring him before us, then.

1002
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:10,600
他要見珮米  讓他進來
- [ Beeps ] - The boy's here to see Padme. [ Woman ] Let him in.

1003
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:16,500
對不起，珮米不在這兒
I'm sorry, Ani, but Padme's not here right now.

1004
01:26:17,710 --> 01:26:18,540
什麼人？
Who is it?

1005
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:22,610
安納金天行者來找珮米
Anakin Skywalker to see Padme, Your Highness.

1006
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:24,940
我派珮米去辦事
I've sent Padme on an errand.

1007
01:26:25,110 --> 01:26:26,740
我就要去絕地神殿
I'm on my way to theJedi temple

1008
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:29,040
開始接受訓練
to start my training, I hope.

1009
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:33,520
可能見不到她了，我想來道別
I may never see her again, so I came to say good-bye.

1010
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:38,650
我會轉告她，她一定為你祝福
We will tell her for you. We are sure her heart goes with you.

1011
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,820
謝謝你，陛下
Thank you, Your Highness.

1012
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:58,810
來自那卜星的議員請發言
The chair recognizes the senator from the sovereign system of Naboo.

1013
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:09,060
最高議長，各位議員
[ Palpatine ] Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the senate,

1014
01:27:10,530 --> 01:27:12,490
發生一場悲劇
a tragedy has occurred...

1015
01:27:12,830 --> 01:27:16,090
全是因為貿易重稅而造成
which started right here with the taxation of trade routes...

1016
01:27:16,770 --> 01:27:21,460
貿易聯邦非法侵佔了那卜星
and has now engulfed our entire planet... in the oppression of the Trade Federation.

1017
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:26,470
你太過份了，我要抗議
This is outrageous! I object to the senator's statements.

1018
01:27:26,810 --> 01:27:30,840
貿易聯邦議員不准發言
The chair does not recognize the senator from the Trade Federation at this time.

1019
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:34,510
那卜星新任的艾米達拉皇后
To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala,

1020
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:38,750
將為我們的人民提出控訴
recently elected ruler of the Naboo, who speaks on our behalf.

1021
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:47,390
諸位共和國議員
Honorable representatives of the Republic,

1022
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:51,100
情況十分危急
I come to you under the gravest of circumstances.

1023
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:53,860
那卜星遭到貿易聯邦侵略...
The Naboo system has been invaded by the droid armies of the Trade--

1024
01:27:53,970 --> 01:27:56,560
我抗議，她沒有證據
I object! There is no proof!.

1025
01:27:58,010 --> 01:27:59,370
太過份了
This is incredible.

1026
01:27:59,710 --> 01:28:03,700
請派代表到那卜星查明真相
We recommend a commission be sent to Naboo to ascertain the truth.

1027
01:28:03,810 --> 01:28:08,450
麥洛斯塔國會支持貿易聯邦
The Congress of Malastare concurs... with the honorable delegate from the Trade Federation.

1028
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:10,210
一定要派出代表團
- A commission must be appointed. - The point--

1029
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:13,190
對不起，議長
- Excuse me, Chancellor. -[ Palpatine ] Enter the bureaucrat.

1030
01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:17,350
這些官僚在幕後操控議會
The true rulers of the Republic.

1031
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:21,160
他們被貿易聯邦收買
And on the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add.

1032
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:26,130
魏倫議長一點權力也沒有
This is where Chancellor Valorum's strength will disappear.

1033
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:29,530
我同意這一點
[ Valorum ] The point is conceded.

1034
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:35,500
請你等調查結束再提出控訴
Will you defer your motion to allow a commission... to explore the validity of your accusations?

1035
01:28:36,150 --> 01:28:41,140
我不能再等 請你馬上阻止這項侵略行動
I will not defer. I've come before you to resolve this attack on our sovereignty now.

1036
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:44,150
我不能看著你們高談闊論
I was not elected to watch my people suffer and die...

1037
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:46,950
卻讓老百姓白白送死
while you discuss this invasion in a committee.

1038
01:28:50,190 --> 01:28:52,590
如果議會無法裁決
If this body is not capable of action,

1039
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,790
也許就需要一名新議長
I suggest new leadership is needed.

1040
01:28:57,870 --> 01:29:02,500
請對魏倫議長投出不信任票
I move for a vote of no confidence... in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

1041
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:11,510
立即投票  立即投票
Vote now! Vote now!

1042
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:15,220
投票！投票！
Vote now! Vote now!

1043
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:16,620
安靜！
- [ Chanting Continues ] Vote now! Vote now! - Order!

1044
01:29:17,490 --> 01:29:19,650
他們會選出新議長
Now they will elect a new chancellor,

1045
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,290
強勢的議長
a strong chancellor,

1046
01:29:22,530 --> 01:29:25,150
他會阻止這場悲劇
one who will not let our tragedy continue.

1047
01:29:27,230 --> 01:29:31,330
他通過不了絕地議會的考驗 他年紀太大了
The boy will not pass the council's test, Master. He's too old.

1048
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:34,530
安納金將成為絕地武士
Anakin will become a Jedi, I promise you.

1049
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:37,170
師父，別再違抗議會的決定
Do not defy the council, Master, not again.

1050
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:39,800
我必須這麼做
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.

1051
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:45,080
要是你守規定早就是議會長老
If you would just follow the code, you would be on the council.

1052
01:29:46,050 --> 01:29:47,910
他們這次不會答應你
They will not go along with you this time.

1053
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,820
你還有得學呢，徒弟
You still have much to learn, my young apprentice.

1054
01:29:55,490 --> 01:29:56,650
一艘飛船
A ship.

1055
01:29:58,560 --> 01:29:59,390
一個杯子
A cup.

1056
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:01,660
一艘飛船
A ship.

1057
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:04,760
一艘飛速快艇
A speeder.

1058
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:14,170
你感覺如何？
How feel you?

1059
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:16,240
很冷
Cold, sir.

1060
01:30:18,310 --> 01:30:21,480
你感到害怕嗎？   不會
Afraid are you? No, sir.

1061
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:24,080
我們能看穿你的心
See through you we can.

1062
01:30:24,590 --> 01:30:26,250
你要控制感覺
Be mindful of your feelings.

1063
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:28,950
你正想著你母親
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.

1064
01:30:30,830 --> 01:30:32,020
我想念她
- I miss her. -[ Yoda ] Mmm.

1065
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:35,660
你怕會失去她嗎？
Afraid to lose her, I think, mmm?

1066
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,990
這有什麼關係？
What has that got to do with anything?

1067
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:39,860
一切都有關係
Everything.

1068
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:43,870
恐懼會引入黑暗之途
Fear is the path to the dark side.

1069
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:46,700
恐懼令人憤怒，憤怒產生仇恨
Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate.

1070
01:30:46,810 --> 01:30:49,640
仇恨帶來苦難
Hate leads to suffering.

1071
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:59,410
你心中充滿恐懼
I sense much fear in you.

1072
01:31:13,310 --> 01:31:16,140
你的人民會死嗎？
Yousa tinking yousa people ganna die?

1073
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:17,600
不知道
I don't know.

1074
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,670
剛耿人也會遭殃？
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

1075
01:31:23,550 --> 01:31:24,810
希望不會
I hope not.

1076
01:31:26,050 --> 01:31:30,050
剛耿人是戰士，死也不投降
Gungans no dyin' without a fight. Wesa warriors.

1077
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:32,690
咱們有強大軍隊
Wesa got a grand army.

1078
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:36,090
所以你們才討厭咱們
Dat's why you no liken us, mesa tinks.

1079
01:31:37,530 --> 01:31:38,360
陛下？
Your Highness?

1080
01:31:41,270 --> 01:31:42,200
陛下
Your Highness.

1081
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:48,070
白議員是最高議長的候選人
Senator Palpatine has been nominated to succeed Valorum... as supreme chancellor.

1082
01:31:48,070 --> 01:31:51,240
這是個令人意外的驚喜
A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.

1083
01:31:52,310 --> 01:31:56,680
要是我當選一定會終結貪污
Your Majesty, if I am elected, I promise to put an end to corruption.

1084
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:58,180
還有誰被提名？
Who else has been nominated?

1085
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:00,180
艾岱倫星的巴安提斯
Bail Antilles of Alderaan

1086
01:32:00,290 --> 01:32:02,520
和麥洛斯塔的李安迪
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

1087
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:07,520
我們的處境會有許多同情票
I feel confident our situation will create a strong sympathy vote for us.

1088
01:32:09,730 --> 01:32:11,250
我會當上議長
I will be chancellor.

1089
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:14,760
我怕等到你能掌權
I fear by the time you have control of the bureaucrats,

1090
01:32:14,870 --> 01:32:17,460
我國人民早就慘遭滅絕
there'll be nothing left of our people, our way of life.

1091
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:23,200
我知道你很擔憂 可是貿易聯邦佔領那卜星
I understand your concern, Your Majesty. Unfortunately, the Federation has possession of our planet.

1092
01:32:25,310 --> 01:32:28,610
議員，這是你的戰場
Senator, this is your arena.

1093
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:30,950
我必須回到我的戰場
I feel I must return to mine.

1094
01:32:34,590 --> 01:32:36,450
我決定回到那卜星
I've decided to go back to Naboo.

1095
01:32:36,860 --> 01:32:37,510
回去？
Go back? But, Your Majesty, be realistic.

1096
01:32:37,820 --> 01:32:40,720
他們會逼你簽署條約
They'll force you to sign the treaty.

1097
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:43,280
我不會簽署條約
I will sign no treaty, Senator.

1098
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:46,090
我將與我的人民同生共死
My fate will be no different than that of our people.

1099
01:32:46,570 --> 01:32:47,730
隊長    陛下
- Captain. - Your Highness.

1100
01:32:48,130 --> 01:32:49,100
準備我的座機
Ready my ship.

1101
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:52,430
請你留下來，這裏比較安全
Please, Your Majesty, stay here where it's safe.

1102
01:32:54,010 --> 01:32:56,840
共和國已經完全腐化
It is clear to me now that the Republic no longer functions.

1103
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:01,180
我希望你能讓議會恢復理性
I pray you will bring sanity and compassion back to the senate.

1104
01:33:11,890 --> 01:33:14,380
他的原力很強大
The Force is strong with him.

1105
01:33:14,490 --> 01:33:15,890
他能接受訓練嗎？
He is to be trained, then?

1106
01:33:18,230 --> 01:33:20,560
不能，他不能接受訓練
No, he will not be trained.

1107
01:33:21,170 --> 01:33:21,890
不能？
No?

1108
01:33:24,770 --> 01:33:25,860
他年紀太大了
He is too old.

1109
01:33:26,970 --> 01:33:29,910
相信我，他能實現預言
He is the chosen one. You must see it.

1110
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:35,210
他的未來充滿烏雲
Mmm. Clouded this boy's future is.

1111
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:39,040
讓我來教他
I will train him, then.

1112
01:33:43,690 --> 01:33:45,820
我收安納金當徒弟
I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.

1113
01:33:47,030 --> 01:33:51,960
你有一個徒弟，不能再收第二個
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible to take on a second.

1114
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:53,220
這違反規定
The code forbids it.

1115
01:33:54,270 --> 01:33:55,320
歐比王準備好了
- Obi-Wan is ready.

1116
01:33:55,430 --> 01:33:57,130
我已經可以接受考驗
- I am ready to face the trials.

1117
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:00,900
我們會決定誰能接受考驗
Our own counsel we will keep on who is ready.

1118
01:34:01,110 --> 01:34:06,340
他很頑固，原力仍須加強
He is headstrong, and he has much to learn of the living Force, but he is capable.

1119
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:08,250
但我不能再教他什麼了
There is little more he can learn from me.

1120
01:34:11,450 --> 01:34:15,020
以後再決定天行者的命運
Young Skywalker's fate... will be decided later.

1121
01:34:15,450 --> 01:34:17,580
現在不是時候
Now is not the time for this.

1122
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:23,260
議會要選出新議長 艾米達拉皇后要回家
The senate is voting for a new supreme chancellor, and Queen Amidala is returning home,

1123
01:34:23,260 --> 01:34:26,460
對貿易聯邦施壓，會擴大對立
which will put pressure on the Federation and could widen the confrontation.

1124
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:29,360
把那名神秘武士引出來
And draw out the queen's attacker.

1125
01:34:29,470 --> 01:34:33,230
跟皇后回去，查出他的身份
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover the identity of this dark warrior.

1126
01:34:35,110 --> 01:34:39,040
他是揭開西斯族之謎的關鍵
This is the clue we need... to unravel the mystery of the Sith.

1127
01:34:39,710 --> 01:34:41,610
願原力與你同在
May the Force be with you.

1128
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:58,120
無意冒犯，但我說的是事實
It's not disrespect, Master. It's the truth.

1129
01:34:58,230 --> 01:34:59,530
這是你的想法
From your point of view.

1130
01:34:59,970 --> 01:35:01,760
這男孩很危險
The boy is dangerous.

1131
01:35:01,870 --> 01:35:03,630
除了你，大家都看得出來
They all sense it. Why can't you?

1132
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:06,700
他是未知數，並不危險
His fate is uncertain. He's not dangerous.

1133
01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:09,100
長老將決定他的命運
The council will decide Anakin's future.

1134
01:35:09,210 --> 01:35:11,680
放心了吧，上船吧
That should be enough for you. Now get on board.

1135
01:35:17,980 --> 01:35:21,750
金師父，我不想惹麻煩
Qui-Gon, sir, I don't want to be a problem.

1136
01:35:21,850 --> 01:35:23,050
你不會
You won't be, Ani.

1137
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:27,920
我不能教你，不過 你要看著我專心學
I'm not allowed to train you, so I want you to watch me and be mindful.

1138
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:29,760
千萬要記得
Always remember:

1139
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:33,460
專心一意才能面對現實
Your focus determines your reality.

1140
01:35:34,230 --> 01:35:36,930
你跟著我就很安全
Stay close to me and you'll be safe.

1141
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:38,890
大師
Master, sir,

1142
01:35:39,570 --> 01:35:42,630
我聽尤達提到迷地原蟲
I heard Yoda talking about midi-chlorians.

1143
01:35:43,110 --> 01:35:46,240
我在想，那是什麼？
I've been wondering-- What are midi-chlorians?

1144
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:52,410
它們是活在細胞的微小生物
Midi-chlorians are a microscopic life-form... that resides within all living cells.

1145
01:35:54,090 --> 01:35:55,180
我身上也有嗎？
- They live inside me?

1146
01:35:55,290 --> 01:35:56,650
活在你的細胞裏
- Inside your cells, yes.

1147
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:59,020
我們是生命共同體
- And we are symbionts with them.

1148
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:00,650
生命共同體？
- Symbionts?

1149
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:04,160
共同生存、互相幫助的個體
Life-forms living together for mutual advantage.

1150
01:36:04,660 --> 01:36:07,290
沒有迷地原蟲就沒有生命
Without the midi-chlorians, life could not exist...

1151
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:09,420
也就沒有原力
and we would have no knowledge of the Force.

1152
01:36:10,570 --> 01:36:15,070
它們不斷發出原力的聲音
They continually speak to us, telling us the will of the Force.

1153
01:36:15,610 --> 01:36:19,310
你只要靜下心就能聽到
When you learn to quiet your mind, you'll hear them speaking to you.

1154
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:21,210
我不明白
I don't understand.

1155
01:36:21,850 --> 01:36:24,820
日子久了你就會明白
With time and training, Ani, you will. You will.

1156
01:36:28,990 --> 01:36:32,620
我很高興能繼續保護你
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure to continue to serve and protect you.

1157
01:36:33,390 --> 01:36:34,790
謝謝你的幫助
I welcome your help.

1158
01:36:34,890 --> 01:36:38,490
白議員說貿易聯邦要殺我
Senator Palpatine fears that the Federation means to destroy me.

1159
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:41,070
我不會讓他們得逞
I assure you I will not allow that to happen.

1160
01:36:42,270 --> 01:36:44,790
咱們要回家了
Wesa goin' ho-o-o-me!

1161
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:46,230
來吧，阿土（R2）
- Come on, R2. - [ Whistles ]

1162
01:36:56,950 --> 01:36:58,880
佔領那卜星了嗎？
Is the planet secure?

1163
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:03,590
我們已經摧毀原始部落
We have taken over the last pockets of primitive life-forms.

1164
01:37:03,690 --> 01:37:06,590
完全佔領那卜星
We are in complete control of the planet now.

1165
01:37:06,690 --> 01:37:12,220
很好，我會繼續控制議會
Good. I will see to it that in the senate things stay as they are.

1166
01:37:13,230 --> 01:37:16,830
我派我的徒弟達斯魔去幫你
I am sending my apprentice, Darth Maul, to join you.

1167
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:18,300
好的，西帝
Yes, my lord.

1168
01:37:18,670 --> 01:37:20,100
西斯人要來？
A Sith here?

1169
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:28,200
這是前進操縱桿
Those are the forward stabilizers.

1170
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:31,070
這些控制起落
And those two control the pitch?

1171
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:34,340
你學得很快
You catch on pretty quick.

1172
01:37:34,950 --> 01:37:39,320
你一去就會被迫簽署條約
[ Panaka ] As soon as we land, the Federation will arrest you and force you to sign the treaty.

1173
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:40,190
沒錯
I agree.

1174
01:37:40,630 --> 01:37:43,030
你這麼做有什麼用？
I'm not sure what you wish to accomplish by this.

1175
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:45,260
我要奪回我們的星球
I will take back what's ours.

1176
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:50,700
我們沒有軍隊，力量薄弱
There are too few of us, Your Highness. We have no army.

1177
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:54,240
我能保護你，不能為你作戰
And I can only protect you. I can't fight a war for you.

1178
01:37:54,470 --> 01:37:56,460
恰恰冰克斯
JarJar Binks.

1179
01:37:57,140 --> 01:37:59,010
你叫我嗎？
Mesa, Your Highness?

1180
01:37:59,980 --> 01:38:02,410
對，我需要你幫忙
Yes. I need your help.

1181
01:38:08,020 --> 01:38:09,920
前面有一艘戰艦
I have one battleship on my scope.

1182
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:12,150
戰鬥機械人的指揮艦
[ Obi-Wan ] It's a droid control ship.

1183
01:38:12,290 --> 01:38:13,920
我們被發現了
They've probably spotted us.

1184
01:38:14,790 --> 01:38:15,990
時間不多
We haven't much time.

1185
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:30,800
恰恰已經趕去剛戈市
-JarJar is on his way to the Gungan city, Master.

1186
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:31,840
很好
- Good.

1187
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:34,300
皇后的計劃有用嗎？
Do you think the queen's idea will work?

1188
01:38:34,810 --> 01:38:36,210
剛耿人很頑固
The Gungans will not be easily swayed.

1189
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:40,640
我們也幫不了她
And we cannot use our power to help her.

1190
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:45,810
師父，我太無禮了
I'm-- I'm sorry for my behavior, Master.

1191
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:48,550
我不該和你爭辯那孩子的事
It's not my place to disagree with you about the boy.

1192
01:38:51,630 --> 01:38:54,330
謝謝你覺得我能接受考驗
And I am grateful you think I'm ready to take the trials.

1193
01:38:55,870 --> 01:38:57,770
你是個好徒弟
You've been a good apprentice, Obi-Wan.

1194
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:01,570
你也比我有智慧
And you're a much wiser man than I am.

1195
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:04,800
你會成為很好的絕地武士
I foresee you will become a greatJedi knight.

1196
01:39:19,090 --> 01:39:20,920
一個人也沒有
Desa nobody dare.

1197
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:23,430
剛戈市空無一人
The Gungan city is deserted.

1198
01:39:24,030 --> 01:39:25,930
那兒一定打過仗
Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.

1199
01:39:26,630 --> 01:39:28,530
他們被抓走了嗎？
Do you think they have been taken to the camps?

1200
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:31,400
我看是被殺光了
More likely they were wiped out.

1201
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:33,530
不見得
- Mesa no tink so.

1202
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:34,900
你知道他們的下落？
- Do you know where they are,JarJar?

1203
01:39:35,370 --> 01:39:38,540
剛耿人有麻煩會到聖地
When in trouble, Gungans go to sacred place.

1204
01:39:39,010 --> 01:39:41,340
我帶你們去，來吧
Mesa show you. Come on. Mesa show you!

1205
01:40:00,100 --> 01:40:03,470
老大，那卜星的艾米達拉皇后
Your Honor, Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1206
01:40:08,810 --> 01:40:13,610
你好呀，那斯老大
Uh, h-heyo dadee, Big Boss Nass, Your Honor.

1207
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:16,610
恰恰冰克斯
JarJar Binks.

1208
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:20,270
他們是什麼人？
Who's da uss-en uthers?

1209
01:40:21,620 --> 01:40:23,310
我是那卜星的艾米達拉皇后
I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1210
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:26,190
我沒有惡意
I come before you in peace.

1211
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:29,520
那卜人真了不起
Ah, Naboo biggen.

1212
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:32,730
你們自以為很聰明
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.

1213
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:36,160
結果招惹上機械兵團
Yousa all bombad.

1214
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:40,600
我們想跟你們結盟
We have searched you out because we wish to form an alliance.

1215
01:40:40,710 --> 01:40:41,570
大人
Your Honor.

1216
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:46,840
她是誰？
Whosa dis?

1217
01:40:47,510 --> 01:40:49,170
我才是艾米達拉皇后
- I am Queen Amidala. - Huh?

1218
01:40:51,050 --> 01:40:53,120
她是我的替身
This is my decoy,

1219
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:56,480
我的帖身侍衛
my protection, my loyal bodyguard.

1220
01:40:56,990 --> 01:41:00,690
很抱歉，我必須保護自己
I'm sorry for my deception, but it was necessary to protect myself.

1221
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:03,520
雖然我們意見相左
Although we do not always agree, Your Honor,

1222
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:06,490
但卻能和平相處
our two great societies have always lived in peace.

1223
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:11,200
貿易聯邦毀了我們的家園
- Ah. - The Trade Federation... has destroyed all that we have worked so hard to build.

1224
01:41:11,700 --> 01:41:14,330
我們不反抗就會滅亡
If we do not act quickly, all will be lost forever.

1225
01:41:14,770 --> 01:41:16,400
請你幫助我們
I ask you to help us.

1226
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:19,040
不，我求你幫助我們
No, I beg you to help us.

1227
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:21,710
我們是你的僕人
We are your humble servants.

1228
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:28,180
把命運交在你手中
Our fate is in your hands.

1229
01:41:45,540 --> 01:41:49,670
你們不覺得剛耿人很低等？
Yousa no tinken yousa greater den da Gungans?

1230
01:41:52,510 --> 01:41:56,040
我高興得很
Me-e-esa lika dis!

1231
01:41:56,250 --> 01:42:00,150
也許咱們...
Maybe... wesa...

1232
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:02,850
可以交朋友
bein friends.

1233
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:13,160
我們派出巡邏隊
We've sent our patrols.

1234
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:16,590
在沼澤發現敵船
We already located their starship in the swamp.

1235
01:42:17,170 --> 01:42:18,930
很快就抓到她
It won't be long, my lord.

1236
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:22,470
沒想到她會這麼做
This is an unexpected move for her.

1237
01:42:22,670 --> 01:42:24,160
太冒險了
It's too aggressive.

1238
01:42:24,810 --> 01:42:26,940
達斯魔，你要小心
Lord Maul, be mindful.

1239
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:29,870
記得要後發制人
Let them make the first move.

1240
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:31,810
是，師父
Yes, my master.

1241
01:42:35,490 --> 01:42:36,750
他們來了
Deysa comin!

1242
01:42:37,190 --> 01:42:38,350
好耶
All right!

1243
01:42:42,060 --> 01:42:43,290
他們來了
They're here!

1244
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:45,020
很好，他們到了
Good. They made it.

1245
01:42:50,030 --> 01:42:52,330
你幹得很好
Yousa doen grand.

1246
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:57,670
恰恰讓我們和那卜人結盟
- [ Chuckles ] -JarJar bring uss-en and da Naboo together. Ah, no, no, no.

1247
01:42:58,040 --> 01:42:58,840
所以
So, wesa make you...

1248
01:42:59,310 --> 01:43:03,470
我要把你升為大將軍
bombad general.

1249
01:43:03,650 --> 01:43:04,620
將軍？
General?

1250
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:12,010
情況如何？
- Your Highness. - What is the situation?

1251
01:43:12,290 --> 01:43:13,950
老百姓大多被捕
Almost everyone's in camps.

1252
01:43:14,060 --> 01:43:17,760
保安隊員和警察組成叛軍
A few hundred police and guards have formed an underground resistance movement.

1253
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:20,130
我把隊長帶回來
I brought back as many of the leaders as I could.

1254
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:24,830
聯邦大軍比我想像的更強大
The Federation army's also much larger than we thought, and much stronger.

1255
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:29,400
我們打不贏這場仗
Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think that we can win.

1256
01:43:29,740 --> 01:43:31,610
這只是幌子
The battle is a diversion.

1257
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:34,540
剛耿人會把機械人引到城外
The Gungans must draw the droid army away from the cities.

1258
01:43:35,150 --> 01:43:35,870
阿土（R2）
- R2. - [ Beeps ]

1259
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:40,940
我們從瀑布底的秘道潛進去
We can enter the city using the secret passages on the waterfall side.

1260
01:43:41,350 --> 01:43:46,020
隊長在入口引開敵人
Once we get to the main entrance, Captain Panaka will create a diversion.

1261
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:48,690
我們趁機衝進皇宮抓住總督
Then we can enter the palace and capture the viceroy.

1262
01:43:49,790 --> 01:43:52,490
敵人就會群龍無首
Without the viceroy, they will be lost and confused.

1263
01:43:53,330 --> 01:43:54,320
大師，你覺得如何？
What do you think, MasterJedi?

1264
01:43:54,870 --> 01:43:56,530
皇宮一定戒備森嚴
The viceroy will be well-guarded.

1265
01:43:56,830 --> 01:43:58,960
只要攻進正殿
The difficulty is getting into the throne room.

1266
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:01,630
應該就不成問題
Once we're inside, we shouldn't have a problem.

1267
01:44:02,210 --> 01:44:06,010
許多剛耿人很可能會戰死
There is a possibility, with this diversion, many Gungans will be killed.

1268
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:09,750
咱們願意犧牲
Wesa ready to do our-san part.

1269
01:44:10,050 --> 01:44:12,980
我們可以瓦解機械兵團
[ Amidala ] We have a plan which should immobilize the droid army.

1270
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:18,410
只要派戰機擊毀指揮艦就行
We will send what pilots we have... to knock out the droid control ship orbiting the planet.

1271
01:44:18,620 --> 01:44:21,520
很好的計劃，不過很冒險
A well-conceived plan. However, there's great risk.

1272
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,920
你的戰機無法穿越防護罩
The weapons on your fighters may not penetrate the shields.

1273
01:44:25,030 --> 01:44:26,520
危險更大
[ Obi-Wan ] There's an even bigger danger.

1274
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:30,960
總督逃走，會引來更多機械兵團
If the viceroy escapes, Your Highness, he will return with another droid army.

1275
01:44:31,300 --> 01:44:34,030
所以一定要抓到他
Well, that is why we must not fail to get the viceroy.

1276
01:44:34,710 --> 01:44:36,430
這是一切的關鍵
Everything depends on it.

1277
01:44:41,710 --> 01:44:44,040
她比我想像更傻
She is more foolish than I thought.

1278
01:44:44,450 --> 01:44:49,080
我們派出全部兵力迎敵
We are sending all troops to meet this army assembling near the swamp.

1279
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:51,880
他們都是土人
It appears to be made up of primitives.

1280
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:54,550
這樣最好
This will work to our advantage.

1281
01:44:54,990 --> 01:44:57,430
你同意我出兵嗎？
I have your approval to proceed, then, my lord?

1282
01:44:58,460 --> 01:44:59,930
把他們殺光
Wipe them out.

1283
01:45:01,970 --> 01:45:03,460
趕盡殺絕
All of them.

1284
01:45:34,930 --> 01:45:35,660
停下來
Halt!

1285
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:41,500
啟動防護罩
Starting up the shield.

1286
01:46:11,270 --> 01:46:12,240
開火
Open fire.

1287
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:31,780
等我們進去你就躲起來
Once we get inside, you find a safe place to hide and stay there.

1288
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:33,590
好   不要亂跑
- Sure. - Stay there.

1289
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:39,890
他們在那兒
[ Droids Squawking ]

1290
01:46:49,770 --> 01:46:51,830
開火  開火
Roger. Roger.

1291
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:02,780
我以為這兒很安全
I thought the battle was going to take place far from here.

1292
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:05,320
太危險了
This is too close.

1293
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:12,720
安納，躲起來
Ani, find cover.

1294
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:14,760
快點
- Quick!

1295
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,160
快上戰機
- Get to your ships!

1296
01:48:14,930 --> 01:48:16,090
前方有敵機
- Fighters straight ahead. - Roger, Bravo Leader.

1297
01:48:16,430 --> 01:48:18,820
收到了     收到
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1298
01:48:26,670 --> 01:48:28,570
停火
Cease fire.

1299
01:48:36,580 --> 01:48:38,510
穩住，穩住
Steady. Steady.

1300
01:49:11,820 --> 01:49:13,580
啟動戰鬥機械人
- Activate the droids.

1301
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:14,680
遵命
- Yes, sir.

1302
01:49:31,640 --> 01:49:33,100
咱們拼了
Ouch time.

1303
01:49:47,590 --> 01:49:48,350
發射
Fire!

1304
01:50:10,780 --> 01:50:12,440
總督在正殿裏
My guess is the viceroy's in the throne room.

1305
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:14,010
紅隊、藍隊
Red group! Blue group!

1306
01:50:14,580 --> 01:50:15,740
我們走
Everybody, this way!

1307
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:18,080
等等我
Hey, wait for me!

1308
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:20,580
你留下來比較安全
Stay where you are. You'll be safe there.

1309
01:50:20,990 --> 01:50:22,650
可是...    留在駕駛艙
- But I-- - Stay in that cockpit.

1310
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:35,860
讓我們對付他
- We'll handle this.

1311
01:50:36,730 --> 01:50:37,960
我們繞過去
- We'll take the long way.

1312
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:00,220
我們得想辦法
We gotta do something, R2.

1313
01:51:23,050 --> 01:51:25,980
我正在找，扳機在哪兒？
I'm trying to! I don't know where the trigger is!

1314
01:51:29,650 --> 01:51:32,520
糟糕，錯了，也許是這個
Oops, wrong one. Maybe it's this one.

1315
01:51:32,820 --> 01:51:35,550
不對，找到了
Nope. Wait. Here it is. Nope. Wait. Here it is.

1316
01:51:44,670 --> 01:51:45,460
走吧
Let's go!

1317
01:51:47,170 --> 01:51:49,370
這是自動駕駛
It's on automatic pilot.

1318
01:51:58,650 --> 01:51:59,980
取消它
- Try to override it. -[ R2-D2 Beeping ]

1319
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:02,240
不能浪費時間
We don't have time for this, Captain.

1320
01:53:08,790 --> 01:53:10,310
他們在那兒
Look! There they are.

1321
01:53:10,590 --> 01:53:12,780
戰機自動飛到這兒
That's where the autopilot's taking us.

1322
01:53:28,810 --> 01:53:32,540
臭機械人，看我的
Aaah! Hmm! Dumb droid. Take that!

1323
01:53:32,540 --> 01:53:34,370
走開，走開
Get off! Get off! Get off! Get off!

1324
01:53:46,060 --> 01:53:48,150
防護罩太強了
The deflector shield is too strong.

1325
01:53:57,640 --> 01:53:58,860
好刺激
- [ Whistles ] - This is tense!

1326
01:54:00,470 --> 01:54:05,670
不取消自動駕駛我們就死定了
Whoa! R2, get us off this autopilot. It's gonna get us both killed.

1327
01:54:05,780 --> 01:54:09,770
你成功了，阿土（R2）
- [ Continues Beeping ] - You did it, R2!

1328
01:54:09,980 --> 01:54:10,910
飛到左邊
Okay, let's go left.

1329
01:54:14,690 --> 01:54:17,450
回去？
- [ Continues Beeping ] - Go back?

1330
01:54:17,790 --> 01:54:21,220
是金師父要我留在駕駛艙的
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit, so that's what I'm gonna do.

1331
01:54:28,900 --> 01:54:30,990
來翻滾一下，對付他們
I'll try spinning. That's a good trick.

1332
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:39,400
我知道有麻煩，坐好
- [ Whistles ] - I know we're in trouble.Just hang on.

1333
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:46,810
快去
Go!

1334
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:53,620
攀爬槍
Ascension guns!

1335
01:57:00,150 --> 01:57:01,050
撤退
Retreat! Retreat!

1336
01:57:03,490 --> 01:57:04,850
太瘋狂了
Dis is nutsen.

1337
01:57:15,400 --> 01:57:16,890
慘了，大麻煩
Uh-oh. Big boomers.

1338
01:57:37,860 --> 01:57:39,250
把我拉上來
Give me a lift! Aaah! Oh!

1339
01:57:47,430 --> 01:57:48,920
恰恰，用熔漿球
JarJar, usen da booma!

1340
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:50,990
我沒有熔漿球
What? Mesa no have a booma!

1341
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:53,030
來，用這顆
Here. Taken dis one.

1342
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:08,310
救我
Help me!

1343
01:58:09,650 --> 01:58:10,550
恰恰
JarJar!

1344
01:58:10,990 --> 01:58:12,220
快跳下來
Jump,JarJar,jump!

1345
01:58:23,130 --> 01:58:25,600
把槍放下，他們贏了
Put down your weapons. They win this round.

1346
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:39,980
我們被擊中了，阿土（R2）
We're hit, R2! Aah!

1347
01:58:53,900 --> 01:58:56,660
我正試著停下來
I'm trying to stop! I'm trying to stop!

1348
01:59:04,110 --> 01:59:05,600
引擎過熱
Everything's overheated.

1349
01:59:05,910 --> 01:59:09,240
情況不太妙
-[ R2-D2 Beeps ] - Oops. This is not good.

1350
01:59:54,830 --> 01:59:58,690
不
No!

1351
02:00:21,790 --> 02:00:23,880
別放棄，恰恰將軍
No giben up, GeneralJarJar.

1352
02:00:24,290 --> 02:00:25,690
我會想辦法
Mesa tink of something.

1353
02:00:26,490 --> 02:00:27,220
舉手投降
- Hands up. - My give up.

1354
02:00:27,590 --> 02:00:29,790
我投降，我投降
- My give up. - [ Groans ]

1355
02:00:39,070 --> 02:00:42,000
你再怎麼反抗也沒用
Your little insurrection is at an end, Your Highness.

1356
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:46,230
簽下條約，乖乖投降吧
Time for you to sign the treaty and end this pointless debate in the senate.

1357
02:00:46,340 --> 02:00:47,280
總督
Viceroy!

1358
02:00:48,150 --> 02:00:49,870
我不會讓你得逞
Your occupation here has ended.

1359
02:00:51,850 --> 02:00:52,970
追上去
After her.

1360
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:54,850
這個是替身
This one's a decoy.

1361
02:01:01,590 --> 02:01:02,520
隊長
Captain!

1362
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:13,630
把門關上
Jam the doors.

1363
02:01:17,970 --> 02:01:20,570
我們要擬一項新條約
Now, Viceroy, we will discuss a new treaty.

1364
02:02:23,940 --> 02:02:27,940
有動力了，啟動防護罩
-[ R2-D2 Beeps ] - Yes! We have power. Shields up.

1365
02:02:29,710 --> 02:02:30,650
看我的
Take this!

1366
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:33,740
再來一下
And this!

1367
02:02:42,630 --> 02:02:43,830
主反應爐正失去動力
- Oops. - We're losing power.

1368
02:02:43,830 --> 02:02:47,020
不可能
- There seems to be a problem with the main reactor. - Impossible!

1369
02:02:47,230 --> 02:02:48,860
他們攻不破防護罩
Nothing can get through our shield.

1370
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:51,090
快走吧
- Let's get outta here. - [ Beeping ]

1371
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:02,610
指揮艦從內部爆炸
What's that? It's blowing up from the inside!

1372
02:03:06,350 --> 02:03:07,210
不是我們幹的
We didn't hit it.

1373
02:03:10,350 --> 02:03:12,340
這樣才過癮
- Now, this is Podracing. - [ Whistles ]

1374
02:03:13,990 --> 02:03:15,690
是我們的戰機
- Look, one of ours, out of the main hold! - Whoo!

1375
02:03:35,580 --> 02:03:38,740
搞什麼？
- [ Motors Winding Down ] - What the--

1376
02:03:39,480 --> 02:03:40,810
它們怎麼了？
Was'n they doing?

1377
02:03:41,180 --> 02:03:43,180
指揮艦被擊毀，你看
The control ship has been destroyed. Look!

1378
02:03:46,660 --> 02:03:47,850
它們都壞了
They all broke-ed.

1379
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:40,240
太...太遲了
[ Muttering ] No, it-- it's too late.

1380
02:04:41,010 --> 02:04:41,740
不
- No.

1381
02:04:41,950 --> 02:04:43,070
歐比王
- Obi-Wan.

1382
02:04:44,410 --> 02:04:45,470
答應我
Promise--

1383
02:04:46,680 --> 02:04:48,780
好好地教那孩子
Promise me you will train the boy.

1384
02:04:49,090 --> 02:04:50,210
是，師父
Yes, Master.

1385
02:04:54,660 --> 02:04:57,060
他會實現預言
He is the chosen one.

1386
02:04:57,630 --> 02:05:00,620
為原力帶來平衡
He... will bring balance.

1387
02:05:02,070 --> 02:05:02,930
好好地教他
Train him.

1388
02:05:30,690 --> 02:05:31,920
總督
Now, Viceroy,

1389
02:05:32,860 --> 02:05:35,700
你得向議會解釋這一切
you're going to have to go back to the senate and explain all this.

1390
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:40,530
你們的貿易特權沒了
I think you can kiss your trade franchise good-bye.

1391
02:05:55,020 --> 02:05:58,250
謝謝你，歐比王肯諾比
We are indebted to you for your bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1392
02:05:58,560 --> 02:06:00,180
還有你，天行者
And you, young Skywalker.

1393
02:06:01,160 --> 02:06:03,750
我相信你一定前途無量
We will watch your career with great interest.

1394
02:06:10,970 --> 02:06:13,270
恭喜你當選議長
Congratulations on your election, Chancellor.

1395
02:06:14,100 --> 02:06:18,810
你的勇氣救了人民 我們應該恭喜你
Your boldness has saved our people, Your Majesty. It's you who should be congratulated.

1396
02:06:18,810 --> 02:06:23,180
讓我們攜手為銀河系帶來和平
Together we shall bring peace and prosperity to the Republic.

1397
02:06:28,550 --> 02:06:32,990
長老同意讓你成為絕地武士
Confer on you the level of Jedi knight the council does.

1398
02:06:33,690 --> 02:06:37,820
至於讓你收這小孩當徒弟
But agree with your taking this boy as your Padawan learner...

1399
02:06:38,190 --> 02:06:39,590
我不同意
I do not.

1400
02:06:40,100 --> 02:06:41,690
金師父對他有信心
Qui-Gon believed in him.

1401
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,600
他也許能實現預言
The chosen one the boy may be.

1402
02:06:47,770 --> 02:06:52,540
但是他會帶來很大的危險
Nevertheless, grave danger I fear in his training.

1403
02:06:52,940 --> 02:06:56,500
尤達大師，我答應了金師父
Master Yoda, I gave Qui-Gon my word.

1404
02:06:56,880 --> 02:07:00,680
我要收安納金為徒
I will train Anakin. Ohh! [ Grunting ]

1405
02:07:00,920 --> 02:07:03,320
有必要我會抗命
Without the approval of the council, if I must.

1406
02:07:03,420 --> 02:07:08,190
你跟魁剛一樣叛逆，這是不好的
Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you. Need that you do not.

1407
02:07:10,430 --> 02:07:12,490
我們答應你
Agree with you the council does.

1408
02:07:14,730 --> 02:07:18,100
讓你收天行者為徒
Your apprentice Skywalker will be.

1409
02:07:45,400 --> 02:07:47,360
我現在該怎麼辦？
What will happen to me now?

1410
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:50,130
長老答應讓我收你為徒
The council have granted me permission to train you.

1411
02:07:50,930 --> 02:07:53,900
你會成為絕地武士
You will be a Jedi, I promise.

1412
02:08:03,480 --> 02:08:06,220
神秘武士毫無疑問是西斯人
There's no doubt the mysterious warrior was a Sith.

1413
02:08:06,220 --> 02:08:09,650
一定有兩個人
Mmm. Always two there are.

1414
02:08:09,850 --> 02:08:12,320
不多也不少
No more, no less.

1415
02:08:13,060 --> 02:08:16,150
師父...和徒弟
A master and an apprentice.

1416
02:08:16,260 --> 02:08:20,760
死的到底是師父還是徒弟？
But which was destroyed? The master or the apprentice?

1417
02:09:34,170 --> 02:09:35,830
和平萬歲
Peace!
