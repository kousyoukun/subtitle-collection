1
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,413
Captain.
Yes, sir?

2
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:04,665
Tell them we wish to board at once.

3
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,460
[Machinery Beeping]
With all due respect,

4
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,963
the ambassadors for the supreme chancellor
wish to board immediately.

5
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,965
Yes, of course.

6
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,177
As you know, our blockade is perfectly legal,

7
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:20,389
and we'd be happy to receive the ambassadors.

8
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,498
I'm TC-14 at your service.

9
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,500
This way, please.

10
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,676
We are greatly honored by your visit, Ambassadors.

11
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,678
Make yourselves comfortable.

12
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,973
My master will be with you shortly.

13
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:07,270
I have a bad feeling about this.

14
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:10,439
I don't sense anything.
It's not about the mission, Master.

15
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:14,485
It's something... elsewhere, elusive.

16
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,988
Don't center on your anxieties, Obi-Wan.

17
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:20,241
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.

18
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,202
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

19
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,329
But not at the expense of the moment.

20
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:28,374
Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.

21
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,418
Yes, Master.

22
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:36,257
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

23
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,509
These Federation types are cowards.

24
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:41,470
The negotiations will be short.

25
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,849
What? What did you say?

26
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,935
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

27
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,937
I knew it.

28
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:52,273
They're here to force a settlement.

29
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:56,444
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

30
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,446
Are you brain-dead?

31
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,450
I'm not going in there with two Jedi.

32
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,493
Send a droid.

33
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,792
Is it in their nature to make us wait this long?

34
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:16,505
No. I sense an unusual amount of fear
for something as trivial as this trade dispute.

35
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,310
What is it?

36
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,063
This scheme of yours has failed, Lord Sidious.

37
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:35,733
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

38
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:40,696
Viceroy, I don't want this stunted slime
in my sight again.

39
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,575
This turn of events is unfortunate.

40
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,788
We must accelerate our plans.
Begin landing your troops.

41
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:52,625
My lord, is that legal?

42
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,044
I will make it legal.

43
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,463
And the Jedi?

44
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:01,967
The chancellor should never
have brought them into this.
Kill them immediately.

45
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:06,389
Yes. Yes, my lord. Uh, as you wish.

46
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,017
Captain, look!

47
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,561
Shields up!

48
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,900
Sorry.

49
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,570
Dioxis.

50
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,036
They must be dead by now.

51
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:33,082
Destroy what's left of them.

52
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,341
Oh! Excuse me.

53
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:45,386
- Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
- Roger, roger.

54
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,055
Uh-oh. Blast them.

55
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:55,354
What is going on down there?

56
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,440
We lost the transmission, sir.

57
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,947
Have you ever encountered a Jedi knight before, sir?

58
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,992
Well, no, but I don't— Seal off the bridge.

59
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,828
Yes, sir.
That won't be enough, sir.

60
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,913
I want droidekas up here at once!

61
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,624
We will not survive this.

62
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,010
[Whining]

63
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,597
Close the blast doors!

64
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,354
That will hold them.

65
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,574
They are still coming through.

66
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,618
This is impossible!

67
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,958
Where are those droidekas?

68
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,295
Master! Destroyers!

69
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,429
They have shield generators!

70
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:13,224
It's a standoff. Let's go.

71
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,939
They're no match for droidekas.

72
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:24,527
Sir! They've gone up the ventilation shaft.

73
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,996
Battle droids.
It's an invasion army.

74
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,376
This is an odd play for the Trade Federation.

75
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,629
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

76
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:48,634
Let's split up. Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.

77
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,637
You were right about one thing, Master.

78
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,224
The negotiations were short.

79
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,811
Sir, a transmission from the planet.

80
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,021
It's Queen Amidala herself.

81
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:04,817
At last we are getting results.

82
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,945
Again you come before us, Your Highness.

83
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,156
You will not be so pleased
when you hear what I have to say, Viceroy.

84
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,994
Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.

85
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,663
I was not aware of such failure.

86
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,499
I have word that the chancellor's ambassadors
are with you now...

87
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:23,335
and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.

88
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,713
I know nothing of any ambassadors.

89
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,215
You must be mistaken.

90
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,342
Beware, Viceroy.

91
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,137
The Federation has gone too far this time.

92
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:37,308
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

93
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,977
You assume too much.

94
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,897
We will see.

95
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:47,026
She's right. The senate will never...
It's too late now.

96
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:50,154
Do you think she suspects an attack?
I don't know.

97
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:54,658
But we must move quickly
to disrupt all communications down there.

98
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:03,918
Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?

99
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,211
How could that be true?

100
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:10,674
I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.

101
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,511
[Distorted Voice]
It must— handiwork— negotiate... ambassadors-

102
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:17,306
nobody would—
Senator Palpatine.

103
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,308
What's happening?

104
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,310
Check the transmission generator.

105
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:26,273
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: Invasion.

106
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,692
The Federation would not dare go that far.

107
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:32,655
The senate would revoke their trade franchise,
and they'd be finished.

108
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,616
We must continue to rely on negotiation.

109
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,953
Negotiation? We've lost all communications.

110
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,372
And where are the chancellor's ambassadors?

111
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,167
This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness.

112
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:49,672
Our security volunteers will be no match
against a battle-hardened Federation army.

113
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:55,844
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

114
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,508
- Yes, Viceroy?
- Captain, we've searched the ship,

115
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,719
and there is no trace of the Jedi.

116
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,596
They may have gotten on one of your landing craft.

117
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:42,182
If they're down here, sir, we'll find them.

118
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:47,146
Use caution.
These Jedi are not to be underestimated.

00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:11,285
Wesa no like da Naboo.
Tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk.

176
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:14,162
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.

177
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:17,207
Day tink day brains so big.

178
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:21,461
Once those droids take control of the surface,
they will take control of you.

179
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,922
Mesa no tink so.

180

Day not know of uss-en.

181
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,970
You and the Naboo form a symbiont circle.

182
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,473
What happens to one of you will affect the other.
You must understand this.

183
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:38,353
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

184
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,023
Then speed us on our way.

Wesa ganna speed yous away.

186
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,570
We could use a transport.

Wesa give yousa una bongo.

188
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,743
Hmm?
Da speediest way tooda Naboo...

'tis goen through the planet core.

190
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,583
Now...

191
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,543

192
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,879
Thank you for your help. We leave in peace.

193
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,089
Master, what's a bongo?

194
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,175
A transport, I hope.

Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.

197
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:18,393
Mmm... any help here would be hot.

198
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,605
Master, we're short on time.

199
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:25,400
We'll need a navigator
to get us through the planet's core.

200
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,444
This Gungan may be of help.

201
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:32,657
What is to become of Jar Jar Binks here?

202
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:37,621
Hisen to be pune-ished.

203
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,998
Ohh.
I saved his life.

204
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,584
He owes me what you call a "life-debt."

205
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:46,546
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.

206
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,049

210
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,728
Begone wit him!

211
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,775
Count me outta dis one.

212
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,028
Better dead here than dead in da core.

213
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:13,281
Yee gods! What mesa sayin?

Dis is nutsen. Oh, gooberfish!

216
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,639
Why were you banished, Jar Jar?
It's a longo tale-o,

217
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:42,811
buta small part of it would be mesa... clumsy.

218
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:47,774
- You were banished because you were clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

Mesa caused mabbe

Big gooberfish! Huge-o teeth!

225
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:34,196
- There's always a bigger fish.

[Engines Howling]

228
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,793
The invasion is on schedule, my lord.

229
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,880
I have the senate
bogged down in procedures.

230
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:56,468
They will have no choice
but to accept your control of the system.

231
00:18:56,552 --> 00:19:01,264
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

232
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:04,392
Queen Amidala is young and naive.

233
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,938
You will find controlling her will not be difficult.

234
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,981
Yes, my lord.

235
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,319
You didn't tell him about the missing Jedi.

236
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:18,949
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

237
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:27,165
Where wesa goin?
Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

238
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,043
Ohh, maxi big, da Force.

239
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,921
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

240

[Alarm Blaring]
We're losing power.

Ohhh, no!

Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

Aah, monster's back!
[Blubbering]

248
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,910
[Roars]

249
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,834
[Whimpering]
Relax.

250
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,919
Ohh.
You overdid it.

251
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,590

253
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,687
Horrible.
Head for that outcropping.

00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,773
[Blubbers]
Oh, boy.

255
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,144
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

256
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,980
Ah, victory.

257
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,493
[Birds Squawking]

258
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:29,621
Mmm, dis'n loverly.

259
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,165
[Engine Powering Down]

260
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:38,171
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?

261
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:42,467
The queen and I will sign a treaty
that will legitimize our occupation here.

262
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,720
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

263
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:49,349
I will not cooperate.
Now, now, Your Highness.

264
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:53,561
In time, the suffering of your people
will persuade you to see our point ofview.

265
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,815
Commander.
Yes, sir.

266
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,527
Process them.
Captain, take them to Camp 4.

268
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,447
Whoops!

269
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,991
[Jar Jar]
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

270
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:01,087
- We should leave the street, Your Highness.
- Get their weapons.

271
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:04,716
Whoa! Yousa guys bombad!

272
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,220
We're ambassadors for the supreme chancellor.

273
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,222
Your negotiations seemed to have failed, Ambassador.

274
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,141
The negotiations never took place.

275
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,643
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

276
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:19,189
- They've knocked out all our communications.
- Do you have transports?

277
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,733
In the main hangar. This way.

278
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,407
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

279
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:33,036
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

280
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,247
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

281
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,083
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

282
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:42,921
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.
They can't afford to kill her.

283
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,173
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

284
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,258
There's no logic in the Federation's move here.

285
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,302
My feelings tell me they will destroy you.

286
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,846
Our only hope is for the senate to side with us.

287
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,390
Senator Palpatine will need your help.

288
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:58,520
Either choice presents great danger... to us all.

289
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,522
We are brave, Your Highness.

290
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,858
If you are to leave, Your Highness, it must be now.

291
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,444
Then I will plead our case to the senate.

292
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:09,322
Be careful, Governor.

293
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:21,417
We'll need to free those pilots.

294
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:23,461
I'll deal with that.

295
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,384
Halt!
I'm ambassador to
the supreme chancellor.

296
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,469
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

297
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:34,806
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

298
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,559
Coruscant? Uh, that doesn't compute.

299
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,561
Uh, wait. You're under arrest.

300
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,360
Come on. Move!

301
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,242
Go!

302
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:21,477
Now, stay here and keep out of trouble.

303
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,401
Hello, boyos.
[Beeping, Whistling]

304
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,408
There's the blockade.

305
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,420
- [Alarm Beeping]
- The shield generator's been hit!

306
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,465
[Alarm Blaring]

309
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,513
How wude!

00:25:57,598 --> 00:26:01,309
[Whistling]

311
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,108
We're losing droids fast.

312
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:12,612
If we can't get the shield generator fixed,
we'll be sitting ducks.

313
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:18,826
- The shields are gone.
- [Whistling, Beeping]

314
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:25,458
The power's back!

315
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,127
[Beeping]

316
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:31,756
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

317
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,467
Deflector shields up at maximum.

318
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:47,730
There's not enough power to get us to Coruscant.
The hyperdrive is leaking.

319
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:50,733
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

320
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,027
Here, Master. Tatooine.

321
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:56,739
Small, out of the way, poor.
The Trade Federation have no presence there.

322
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,700
How can you be sure?

323
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,743
It's controlled by the Hutts.

324
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:03,705
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

325
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,124
- If they discovered her...
- It'd be no different than if we landed...

326
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,084
on a system controlled by the Federation,

327
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:12,547
except that the Hutts aren't looking for her,
which gives us the advantage.

328
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:20,013
And Queen Amidala, has she signed the treaty?

329
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:23,808
She has disappeared, my lord.

330
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:28,062
One Naboo cruiser got past the blockade.

331
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:31,149
[Snarls]
I want that treaty signed.

332
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,317
My lord,

333
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,987
it's impossible to locate the ship.

334
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,322
It's out of our range.

335
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:41,159
Not for a Sith.

336
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,161
This is my apprentice,

337
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,204
Darth Maul.

338
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:49,834
He will find your lost ship.

339
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:56,466
This is getting out of hand.

340
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,593
Now there are two of them.

341
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,763
We should not have made this bargain.

342
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:10,605
An extremely well-put-together little droid,
Your Highness.

343
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,608
Without a doubt,
it saved the ship, as well as our lives.

344
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:17,028
It is to be commended. What is its number?

345
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,614

00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,699
[Whistling, Beeping]

518
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,088
[Exhaling]
Mom!

519
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:22,883
Mom, I'm home!
[Jar Jar]
Ahh, dissen cozy.

520
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,386
These are my friends, Mom.
[Jar Jar] Hello.

521
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:29,098
I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

522
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:31,558
Your son was kind enough to offer us shelter.

523
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:35,187
Come on. I'll show you 3 PO.
Oh, mooie-mooie.

524
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:38,232
[Beeping, Chirping]

525
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:46,156
Isn't he great? He's not finished yet.

526
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:48,117
He's wonderful.

527
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:51,120
[Beeping]
[Anakin]
You really like him?

528
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:54,206
He's a protocol droid to help Mom. Watch.

529
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:59,878
Oh. Oh. Uh— Where is everybody?

530
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:03,298
Whoops. Yeah.

531
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,592
Oh, hello.

532
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:09,012
I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.

533
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,973
How might I serve you?

534
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,934
He's perfect.
Oh. Perfect.

535
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,563
When the storm is over,
I'll show you my racer.
I'm building a Podracer.

536
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:21,525
- [Whistling]
- I'm not sure this floor is entirely stable.

537
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,820
Oh, hello.
I don't believe we have been introduced.

538
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,613
[Excited Beeping]

539
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:29,032
R2-D2. A pleasure to meet you.

540
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,161
I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.

541
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:34,705
[Chirping, Bleeping]

542
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:38,000
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, "naked"?

543
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:42,963
My parts are showing? My goodness! Oh!

544
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,053
The death toll is catastrophic.

545
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,514
We must bow to their wishes.

546
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,683
You must contact me.

547
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:57,519
It's a trick. Send no reply.

548
00:39:57,604 --> 00:40:01,106
Send no transmissions of any kind.

549
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:04,777
It sounds like bait to establish a connection trace.

550
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:08,864
What if it is true, and the people are dying?

551
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,492
Either way, we're running out of time.

552
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,257
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

553
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:30,177
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

554
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,179
Move against the Jedi first.

555
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,015
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo...

556
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,017
to sign the treaty.

557
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,311
At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi.

558
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,855
At last we will have revenge.

559
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,858
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

560
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,361
They will be no match for you.

561
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:57,204
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

562
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,290
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

563
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,919
Any attempt to escape-
And they blow you up!

564
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,463
Boom!
How wude!

565
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:09,007
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

566
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,009
The Republic's antislavery laws...

567
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:13,470
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

568
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:16,598
We must survive on our own.

569
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:19,351
[Gulps]
Xcuse me.

570
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:22,855
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

571
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:27,609
They have Podracing on Malastare.
Very fast, very dangerous.

572
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:30,279
I'm the only human who can do it.

573
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:33,574
You must have Jedi reflexes if you race pods.

574
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:35,951
[Gasps]
Don't do that again.

575
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:39,788
[Yelping, Blubbering]

576
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:43,959
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

577
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:48,463
What makes you think that?

578
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:52,843
I saw your laser sword.
Only Jedis carry that kind of weapon.

579
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,846
Perhaps I killed a Jedi and took it from him.

580
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,848
I don't think so.

581
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,100
No one can kill a Jedi.

582
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,020
I wish that were so.

583
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,188
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

584
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:08,400
I came back here and freed all the slaves.

585
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,945
Have you come to free us?
No, I'm afraid not.

586
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:16,408
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

587
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,999
I can see there's no fooling you, Anakin.

588
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:27,169
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic,

589
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,254
on a very important mission.

590
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:32,466
How did you end up out here in the outer rim?

591
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,178
Our ship was damaged,
and we're stranded here
until we can repair it.

592
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,388
I can help.

593
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:42,267
I can fix anything.
[Qui-Gon]
I believe you can.

594
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:45,228
But first we must acquire the parts we need.

595
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:48,065
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

596
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:51,693
These junk dealers must have
a weakness of some kind.

597
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:56,281
Gambling. Everything here revolves around
betting on those awful races.

598
00:42:56,366 --> 00:43:00,577
Podracing. Greed can be a powerful ally.

599
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:03,580
I built a racer. It's the fastest ever.

600
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:06,166
There's a big race tomorrow on Boonta Eve.

601
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,877
You could enter my pod.
[Mother]
Anakin!

602
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:12,089
- Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

603
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,049
You could make him think it was yours...

604
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,426
and get him to let me pilot it for you.

605
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:20,722
I don't want you to race. It's awful.
I die every time Watto makes you do it.

606
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:23,016
But, Mom, I love it.

607
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:26,645
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

608
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,064
Anakin.

609
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,984
Your mother's right.

610
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:35,195
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

611
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:38,407
No.

612
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:48,041
Mom, you say the biggest problem
in this universe is nobody helps each other.

613
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:55,799
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

614
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,801
We'll find some other way.

615
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,178
No.

616
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:02,764
There is no other way.

617
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:07,185
I may not like it, but he can help you.

618
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,896
He was meant to help you.

619
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,531
[Growling]

620
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,370
Are you sure about this?

621
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:28,165
Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know?

622
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,292
The queen will not approve.

623
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:33,336
The queen doesn't need to know.

624
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,005
Well, I don't approve.

625
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:38,842
[Bell Dings]
The boy tells me you want to
sponsor him in the race.

626
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:43,972
How can you do this?
Not on the Republic credits, I think, huh?

627
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:46,266
My ship will be the entry fee.

628
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,477
Oh, not bad!

629
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:51,563
Not bad, huh? A Nubian, huh?

630
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:54,983
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

631
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:57,611
What would the boy ride?

632
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:01,281
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It will take some long time to fix it.

633
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:05,535
It wasn't my fault, really.
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

634
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:09,039
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

635
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:12,626
Mmm. That you did, huh.
[Chuckling]

636
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,545
The boy's good. No doubts there, huh?

637
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:19,966
I have acquired a pod in a game of chance,
the fastest ever built.

638
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:25,180
I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it, huh?

639
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,057
[Laughing]

640
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:30,227
So, you supply the pod and the entry fee,

641
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:32,229
and I supply the boy.

642
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:36,233
We split the winnings,
um, 50-50, I think, huh?

643
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:40,987
If it's going to be 50-50,
I suggest you front the cash for the entry.

644
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:43,156
If we win,

645
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:47,077
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

646
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:50,413
And if we lose, you keep my ship.

647
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:54,251
Either way, you win.

648
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:56,044
[Grumbling]

649
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:58,672
[Grumbling Continues]

650
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:02,384
Deal!

651
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:10,851
[Huttese]
Your friend is a foolish one, methinks.

652
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:21,778
What if this plan fails, Master?

653
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:24,614
We could be stuck here a very long time.

654
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,242
Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help,

655
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:30,787
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

656
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:32,873
And...

657
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:35,834
there's something about this boy.

658
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:44,009
You should be very proud of your son.

659
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:47,137
He gives without any thought of reward.

660
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:50,098
Well, he knows nothing of greed.

661
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:54,186
He has a-
He has special powers.

662
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,189
Yes.

663
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,983
He can see things before they happen.

664
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,903
That's why he appears to have such quick reflexes.

665
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,863
It's a Jedi trait.

666
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:07,824
He deserves better than a slave's life.
Why, certainly.

667
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:11,286
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

668
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,333
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

669
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:19,377
Who was his father?

670
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:23,965
There was no father.

671
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:28,762
I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him.

672
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:32,140
I can't explain what happened.

673
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,602
Can you help him?

674
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,646
I don't know.

675
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:43,777
I didn't actually come here to free slaves.

676
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:50,825
[Giggling]

677
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,869
Hey, hi, Ani.

678
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:55,455
Hi.

679
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,792
[R2-D2 Beeping]
Wow, a real astro droid.

680
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,502
[Beeping]

681
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:04,381
How did you get so lucky?
That isn't the half of it.

682
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:07,509
I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
What?

683
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,344
With this?

684
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:12,222
[Alien Language]
You're such a joker, Ani.

685
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:15,600
[Basic] You've been working
on that thing for years.
It's never gonna run.

686

1037
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:15,356
and you, Governor, are going to die...

1038
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:18,359
much sooner than your people, I'm afraid.

1039
01:18:18,444 --> 01:18:20,612
This invasion will gain you nothing.

1040
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:23,740
We're a democracy. The people have decided.

1041
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:25,784
Take him away.

1042
01:18:29,163 --> 01:18:32,082
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps...

1043
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:34,584
for these rumored underwater villages.

1044
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:37,128
They will not stay hidden for long.

1045
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,718
[Muttering, Snoring]

1046
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:50,892
The death toll is catastrophic.

1047
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:53,603
We must bow to their wishes.

1048
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:55,980
You must contact me.

1049
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:11,996
You all right?

1050
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:14,791
It's very cold.

1051
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:19,087
[Continues Muttering, Snoring]

1052
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:25,677
You come from a warm planet, Ani.

1053
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:28,179
A little too warm for my taste.

1054
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:30,557
Space is cold.

1055
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:32,851
You seem sad.

1056
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:36,271
The queen is worried.

1057
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:38,731
Her people are suffering, dying.

1058
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:42,402
She must convince the senate to intervene, or...

1059
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:46,197
I'm not sure what'll happen.

1060
01:19:47,575 --> 01:19:49,701
I made this for you...

1061
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,037
so you'd remember me.

1062
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:56,457
I carved it out of a japor snippet.

1063
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:59,377
It'll bring you good fortune.

1064
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,379
It's beautiful.

1065
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:03,882
But I don't need this to remember you by.

1066
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:10,930
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani,

1067
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:13,600
but my caring for you will remain.

1068
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:19,480
I care for you, too, only l-

1069
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:21,733
Miss your mother.

1070
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:44,380
Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.

1071
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:46,257
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.

1072
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:49,636
And look over there.
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.

1073
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:22,168
It is a great gift to see you alive, Your Majesty.

1074
01:21:22,253 --> 01:21:25,088
With the communications breakdown,
we've been very concerned.

1075
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:27,882
I'm anxious to hearyour report on the situation.

1076
01:21:27,967 --> 01:21:30,593
May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.

1077
01:21:30,678 --> 01:21:34,847
Welcome, Your Highness.
It's an honor to finally meet you in person.

1078
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:37,558
Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.

1079
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:40,812
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.

1080
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:43,648
I've called for a special session
of the senate to hear your position.

1081
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:47,652
I'm grateful for your concern, Chancellor.

1082
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:49,654
There is a question of procedure,

1083
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:52,490
but I'm confident we can overcome it.

1084
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:55,493
I must speak with the Jedi Council immediately.

1085
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:58,454
The situation has become much more complicated.

1086
01:22:04,169 --> 01:22:06,129
Ani, come on.

1087
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:20,018
The queen's a bein' grossly nice, mesa tinks.

1088
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:23,354
Pitty hot.

1089
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:51,090
[Men Conversing, Faint]

1090
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:55,511
[Palpatine]
There is no civility, only politics.

1091
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:59,515
The Republic is not what it once was.

1092
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:04,896
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.

1093
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,898
There is no interest...

1094
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:09,108
in the common good.

1095
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:11,444
I must be frank, Your Majesty.

1096
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:14,447
There is little chance
the senate will act on the invasion.

1097
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:17,450
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.

1098
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:21,662
If I may say so, Your Majesty,
the chancellor has little real power.

1099
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:25,625
He is mired by baseless accusations of corruption.

1100
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:29,504
The bureaucrats are in charge now.
What options have we?

1101
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:33,174
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...

1102
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:35,176
of a stronger supreme chancellor,

1103
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,762
one who could control the bureaucrats...

1104
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:39,722
and give us justice.

1105
01:23:39,807 --> 01:23:44,102
You could call for a vote of no confidence...

1106
01:23:44,186 --> 01:23:46,104
in Chancellor Valorum.

1107
01:23:46,188 --> 01:23:48,731
He has been our strongest supporter.

1108
01:23:48,816 --> 01:23:54,070
Our only other choice
would be to submit a plea to the courts.

1109
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:57,532
The courts take even longer to decide things
than the senate.

1110
01:23:57,616 --> 01:24:00,535
Our people are dying, Senator.

1111
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:04,372
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

1112
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:07,083
To be realistic, Your Majesty,

1113
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:12,255
I think we're going to have to accept
Federation control for the time being.

1114
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:16,050
That is something I cannot do.

1115
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:25,977
He was trained in the Jedi arts.

1116
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:30,022
My only conclusion can be that it was a Sith lord.

1117
01:24:30,107 --> 01:24:34,318
Impossible.
The Sith have been extinct
for a millennium.

1118
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:38,614
I do not believe the Sith
could have returned without us knowing.

1119
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:41,826
Ah, hard to see, the dark side is.

1120
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:44,829
We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.

1121
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:47,957
We will discover the identity
of your attacker.

1122
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:50,001
May the Force be with you.

1123
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:55,465
[Yoda]
Master Qui-Gon.

1124
01:24:55,549 --> 01:24:58,009
More to say have you?

1125
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:02,180
With your permission, my master,

1126
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:06,684
I have encountered a vergence in the Force.

1127
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:09,812
A vergence, you say?

1128
01:25:09,897 --> 01:25:12,064
Located around a person?

1129
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:14,066
A boy.

1130
01:25:14,151 --> 01:25:17,987
His cells have the highest concentration
of midi-chlorians I have seen in a life-form.

1131
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:21,032
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

1132
01:25:22,659 --> 01:25:25,036
You refer to the prophecy...

1133
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,538
of the one who will bring balance to the Force.

1134
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:29,457
You believe it's this boy?

1135
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:32,210
I don't presume to...
[Yoda]
But you do.

1136
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:34,962
Revealed your opinion is.

1137
01:25:35,047 --> 01:25:37,089
I request the boy be tested, Master.

1138
01:25:37,174 --> 01:25:42,428
Oh? Trained as a Jedi you request for him, hmm?

1139
01:25:42,513 --> 01:25:45,306
Finding him was the will of the Force.

1140
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:47,350
I have no doubt of that.

1141
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:53,397
[Sighs]

1142
01:25:53,482 --> 01:25:56,067
Bring him before us, then.

1143
01:26:06,078 --> 01:26:08,996
[Beeps]
The boy's here to see Padmé.

1144
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:11,040
[Woman]
Let him in.

1145
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:17,838
I'm sorry, Ani,
but Padmé's not here right now.

1146
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:20,258
Who is it?

1147
01:26:20,342 --> 01:26:23,386
Anakin Skywalker to see Padmé,
Your Highness.

1148
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:25,388
I've sent Padmé on an errand.

1149
01:26:25,472 --> 01:26:30,393
I'm on my way to the Jedi temple
to start my training, I hope.

1150
01:26:30,477 --> 01:26:34,355
I may never see her again,
so I came to say good-bye.

1151
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:36,357
We will tell her for you.

1152
01:26:36,441 --> 01:26:39,068
We are sure her heart goes with you.

1153
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:41,279
Thank you, Your Highness.

1154
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:59,338
The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.

1155
01:26:59,423 --> 01:27:02,508
[Senators Murmuring]

1156
01:27:06,096 --> 01:27:10,516
[Palpatine]
Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the senate,

1157
01:27:10,601 --> 01:27:13,019
a tragedy has occurred...

1158
01:27:13,103 --> 01:27:16,647
which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes...

1159
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:19,775
and has now engulfed our entire planet...

1160
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:21,902
in the oppression of the Trade Federation.

1161
01:27:21,987 --> 01:27:24,238
This is outrageous!

1162
01:27:24,323 --> 01:27:26,907
I object to the senator's statements.

1163
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:31,078
The chair does not recognize
the senator from the Trade Federation at this time.

1164
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:35,082
To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala,

1165
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:37,168
recently elected ruler of the Naboo,

1166
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,170
who speaks on our behalf.

1167
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:41,172
[Murmuring Continues]

1168
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:47,928
Honorable representatives of the Republic,

1169
01:27:48,013 --> 01:27:51,140
I come to you
under the gravest of circumstances.

1170
01:27:51,224 --> 01:27:54,268
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade...

1171
01:27:54,353 --> 01:27:57,813
I object! There is no proof!

1172
01:27:57,898 --> 01:27:59,815
This is incredible.

1173
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:03,986
We recommend a commission be sent to Naboo
to ascertain the truth.

1174
01:28:04,071 --> 01:28:06,322
The Congress of Malastare concurs...

1175
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:09,241
with the honorable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

1176
01:28:09,326 --> 01:28:11,744
A commission must be appointed.
The point—

1177
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:14,997
Excuse me, Chancellor.
[Palpatine]
Enter the bureaucrat.

1178
01:28:15,082 --> 01:28:17,792
The true rulers of the Republic.

1179
01:28:17,876 --> 01:28:22,046
And on the payroll of the Trade Federation,
I might add.

1180
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:26,384
This is where Chancellor Valorum's strength
will disappear.

1181
01:28:27,928 --> 01:28:30,304
[Valorum]
The point is conceded.

1182
01:28:30,389 --> 01:28:33,307
Will you defer your motion
to allow a commission...

1183
01:28:33,392 --> 01:28:35,935
to explore the validity of your accusations?

1184
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:37,937
I will not defer.

1185
01:28:38,021 --> 01:28:41,565
I've come before you to resolve this attack
on our sovereignty now.

1186
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:44,694
I was not elected
to watch my people suffer and die...

1187
01:28:44,778 --> 01:28:47,530
while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.

1188
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:52,827
If this body is not capable of action,

1189
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:55,955
I suggest new leadership is needed.

1190
01:28:57,708 --> 01:29:00,584
I move for a vote of no confidence...

1191
01:29:00,669 --> 01:29:02,670
in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

01:29:02,754 --> 01:29:06,173
[Senators Murmuring, Shouting]

1193
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:14,807
Vote now! Vote now!

Vote now! Vote now!

1195
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:20,688

01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:22,690
a strong chancellor,

1197
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:25,693
one who will not let our tragedy continue.

1198
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:31,699
The boy will not pass the council's test, Master.
He's too old.

1199
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:34,744
Anakin will become a Jedi, I promise you.

1200
01:29:34,828 --> 01:29:37,747
Do not defy the council, Master,
not again.

1201
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:40,624
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.

1202
01:29:42,461 --> 01:29:46,255
If you would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.

1203
01:29:46,339 --> 01:29:49,508
They will not
go along with you this time.

1204
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:52,511
You still have much to learn,
my young apprentice.

1205
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:57,183
A ship.

1206
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:00,770
A cup.

1207
01:30:00,854 --> 01:30:02,688
A ship.

1208
01:30:03,774 --> 01:30:06,317
A speeder.

1209
01:30:08,278 --> 01:30:10,196
Hmm.

1210
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:14,742
How feel you?

1211
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:16,744
Cold, sir.

1212
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:19,872
Afraid are you?

1213
01:30:19,956 --> 01:30:21,916
No, sir.

1214
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,627
See through you we can.

1215
01:30:24,711 --> 01:30:26,629
Be mindful of your feelings.

1216
01:30:26,713 --> 01:30:29,507
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.

1217
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:33,719
I miss her.
[Yoda]
Mmm.

1218
01:30:33,804 --> 01:30:36,305
Afraid to lose her, I think, mmm?

1219
01:30:36,389 --> 01:30:38,599
What has that got to do with anything?

1220
01:30:38,683 --> 01:30:41,018
Everything.

1221
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:44,188
Fear is the path to the dark side.

1222
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:47,191
Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate.

1223
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:50,694
Hate leads to suffering.

1224
01:30:57,202 --> 01:31:00,120
I sense much fear in you.

1225
01:31:13,009 --> 01:31:16,428
Yousa tinking
yousa people ganna die?

1226
01:31:16,513 --> 01:31:18,430
I don't know.

1227
01:31:18,515 --> 01:31:21,100
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

1228
01:31:22,853 --> 01:31:25,604
I hope not.

1229
01:31:25,689 --> 01:31:28,315
Gungans no dyin' without a fight.

1230
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,317
Wesa warriors.

1231
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:33,821
Wesa got a grand army.

1232
01:31:33,905 --> 01:31:37,324
Dat's why you no liken us,
mesa tinks.

1233
01:31:37,409 --> 01:31:40,286
Your Highness?

1234
01:31:41,413 --> 01:31:43,581
Your Highness.

1235
01:31:43,665 --> 01:31:46,834
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum...

1236
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:49,003
as supreme chancellor.

1237
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:52,006
A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.

1238
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:56,802
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

1239
01:31:56,887 --> 01:31:58,596
Who else has been nominated?

1240
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:03,017
Bail Antilles of Alderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

1241
01:32:03,101 --> 01:32:08,063
I feel confident our situation
will create a strong sympathy vote for us.

1242
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:11,775
I will be chancellor.

1243
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:14,528
I fear by the time you have control
of the bureaucrats,

1244
01:32:14,613 --> 01:32:17,865
there'll be nothing left of our people,
our way of life.

1245
01:32:17,949 --> 01:32:19,867
I understand your concern, Your Majesty.

1246
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:23,495
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.

1247
01:32:25,248 --> 01:32:29,376
Senator, this is your arena.

1248
01:32:29,461 --> 01:32:31,420
I feel I must return to mine.

1249
01:32:34,007 --> 01:32:36,926
I've decided to go back to Naboo.

1250
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:39,011
Go back?
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.

1251
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:41,013
They'll force you to sign the treaty.

1252
01:32:41,097 --> 01:32:43,515
I will sign no treaty, Senator.

1253
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:46,143
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

1254
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:48,145
Captain.
Your Highness.

1255
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:50,147
Ready my ship.

1256
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:53,943
Please, Your Majesty, stay here where it's safe.

1257
01:32:54,027 --> 01:32:57,237
It is clear to me now
that the Republic no longer functions.

1258
01:32:57,322 --> 01:33:01,659
I pray you will bring
sanity and compassion back to the senate.

1259
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:14,421
The Force is strong with him.

1260
01:33:14,506 --> 01:33:16,465
He is to be trained, then?

1261
01:33:17,884 --> 01:33:20,970
No, he will not be trained.

1262
01:33:21,054 --> 01:33:22,805
No?

1263
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:26,850
He is too old.

1264
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:30,771
He is the chosen one. You must see it.

1265
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:35,526
Mmm. Clouded this boy's future is.

1266
01:33:37,696 --> 01:33:39,530
I will train him, then.

1267
01:33:43,868 --> 01:33:46,704
I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.

1268
01:33:46,788 --> 01:33:49,790
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.

1269
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:52,251
Impossible to take on a second.

1270
01:33:52,335 --> 01:33:54,003
The code forbids it.

1271
01:33:54,129 --> 01:33:57,548
Obi-Wan is ready.
I am ready to face the trials.

1272
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:01,301
Our own counsel we will keep on who is ready.

1273
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:03,303
He is headstrong,

1274
01:34:03,388 --> 01:34:06,765
and he has much to learn of the living Force,
but he is capable.

1275
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:08,892
There is little more he can learn from me.

1276
01:34:11,438 --> 01:34:13,355
Young Skywalker's fate...

1277
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:15,315
will be decided later.

1278
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,985
Now is not the time for this.

1279
01:34:18,069 --> 01:34:20,738
The senate is voting for a new supreme chancellor,

1280
01:34:20,822 --> 01:34:23,532
and Queen Amidala is returning home,

1281
01:34:23,616 --> 01:34:26,869
which will put pressure on the Federation and
could widen the confrontation.

1282
01:34:26,953 --> 01:34:29,288
And draw out the queen's attacker.

1283
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:33,792
Go with the queen to Naboo
and discover the identity of this dark warrior.

1284
01:34:35,045 --> 01:34:36,962
This is the clue we need...

1285
01:34:37,047 --> 01:34:39,339
to unravel the mystery of the Sith.

1286
01:34:39,424 --> 01:34:42,259
May the Force be with you.

1287
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:58,358
It's not disrespect, Master. It's the truth.

1288
01:34:58,443 --> 01:35:00,360
From your point ofview.

1289
01:35:00,445 --> 01:35:03,864
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

1290
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:06,867
His fate is uncertain. He's not dangerous.

1291
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:09,369
The council will decide Anakin's future.

1292
01:35:09,454 --> 01:35:12,372
That should be enough for you. Now get on board.

1293
01:35:16,211 --> 01:35:18,128
[Whimpers]

1294
01:35:18,213 --> 01:35:21,799
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.

1295
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:24,134
You won't be, Ani.

1296
01:35:24,219 --> 01:35:28,347
I'm not allowed to train you,
so I want you to watch me and be mindful.

1297
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:31,350
Always remember:

1298
01:35:31,434 --> 01:35:34,103
Your focus determines your reality.

1299
01:35:34,187 --> 01:35:37,397
Stay close to me and you'll be safe.

1300
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:39,316
Master, sir,

1301
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:43,028
I heard Yoda talking about midi-chlorians.

1302
01:35:43,113 --> 01:35:46,657
I've been wondering— What are midi-chlorians?

1303
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:50,327
Midi-chlorians are a microscopic life-form...

1304
01:35:50,411 --> 01:35:52,704
that resides within all living cells.

1305
01:35:54,124 --> 01:35:57,000
They live inside me?
Inside your cells, yes.

1306
01:35:57,127 --> 01:36:00,629
And we are symbionts with them.
Symbionts?

1307
01:36:00,713 --> 01:36:04,633
Life-forms living together for mutual advantage.

1308
01:36:04,717 --> 01:36:07,636
Without the midi-chlorians, life could not exist...

1309
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:10,556
and we would have no knowledge of the Force.

1310
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:12,558
They continually speak to us,

1311
01:36:12,642 --> 01:36:15,352
telling us the will of the Force.

1312
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:17,604
When you learn to quiet your mind,

1313
01:36:17,689 --> 01:36:19,606
you'll hear them speaking to you.

1314
01:36:19,691 --> 01:36:21,608
I don't understand.

1315
01:36:21,693 --> 01:36:25,195
With time and training, Ani, you will. You will.

1316
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:33,287
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure to continue
to serve and protect you.

1317
01:36:33,371 --> 01:36:35,289
I welcome your help.

1318
01:36:35,373 --> 01:36:38,792
Senator Palpatine fears
that the Federation means to destroy me.

1319
01:36:38,877 --> 01:36:42,087
I assure you I will not allow that to happen.

1320
01:36:42,172 --> 01:36:45,090
Wesa goin' ho-o-o-me!

1321
01:36:45,175 --> 01:36:48,093
Come on, R2.
[Whistles]

1322
01:36:56,644 --> 01:36:59,730
Is the planet secure?

1323
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:03,734
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

1324
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:06,945
We are in complete control
of the planet now.

1325
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:12,910
Good. I will see to it that in the senate
things stay as they are.

1326
01:37:12,994 --> 01:37:16,914
I am sending my apprentice,
Darth Maul, to join you.

1327
01:37:16,998 --> 01:37:18,916
Yes, my lord.

1328
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,918
A Sith here?

1329
01:37:26,299 --> 01:37:28,800
Those are the forward stabilizers.

1330
01:37:28,885 --> 01:37:31,303
And those two control the pitch?

1331
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:34,765
You catch on pretty quick.

1332
01:37:34,849 --> 01:37:36,767
[Panaka]
As soon as we land,

1333
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:39,603
the Federation will arrest you
and force you to sign the treaty.

1334
01:37:39,687 --> 01:37:43,440
I agree. I'm not sure
what you wish to accomplish by this.

1335
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:46,443
I will take back what's ours.

1336
01:37:46,527 --> 01:37:48,987
There are too few of us, Your Highness.

1337
01:37:49,072 --> 01:37:50,989
We have no army.

1338
01:37:51,074 --> 01:37:54,660
And I can only protect you.
I can't fight a war for you.

1339
01:37:54,744 --> 01:37:56,745
Jar Jar Binks.

1340
01:37:56,829 --> 01:37:59,873
Mesa, Your Highness?

1341
01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:02,876
Yes. I need your help.

1342
01:38:08,091 --> 01:38:10,342
I have one battleship on my scope.

1343
01:38:10,426 --> 01:38:12,552
[Obi-Wan]
It's a droid control ship.

1344
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:14,554
They've probably spotted us.

1345
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:16,682
We haven't much time.

1346
01:38:28,152 --> 01:38:32,072
Jar Jar is on his way
to the Gungan city, Master.
Good.

1347
01:38:32,156 --> 01:38:35,075
Do you think
the queen's idea will work?

1348
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:38,078
The Gungans will not be easily swayed.

1349
01:38:38,162 --> 01:38:41,039
And we cannot use our power to help her.

1350
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:45,919
I'm— I'm sorry for my behavior, Master.

1351
01:38:46,004 --> 01:38:49,798
It's not my place
to disagree with you about the boy.

1352
01:38:51,676 --> 01:38:55,012
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.

1353
01:38:56,097 --> 01:38:58,015
You've been a good apprentice, Obi-Wan.

1354
01:38:59,434 --> 01:39:02,352
And you're a much wiser man than I am.

1355
01:39:02,437 --> 01:39:06,189
I foresee you will become a great Jedi knight.

1356
01:39:09,068 --> 01:39:11,028
[Grunts]

1357

[Blubbering]

1358
01:39:19,162 --> 01:39:21,580
Desa nobody dare.

1359
01:39:21,664 --> 01:39:23,874
The Gungan city is deserted.

1360
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:26,543
Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.

1361
01:39:26,627 --> 01:39:29,755
Do you think they have been
taken to the camps?

1362
01:39:29,839 --> 01:39:32,174
More likely they were wiped out.

1363
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:35,385
Mesa no tink so.
Do you know where they are, Jar Jar?

1364
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:38,930
When in trouble, Gungans go to sacred place.

1365
01:39:39,015 --> 01:39:41,933
Mesa show you. Come on. Mesa show you!

1366
01:39:45,646 --> 01:39:48,065
[Creatures Bleating]

1367
01:39:59,452 --> 01:40:03,914
Your Honor, Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

01:40:09,087 --> 01:40:13,882
Uh, h-heyo dadee,

I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

I come before you in peace.

because we wish to form an alliance.

01:40:40,868 --> 01:40:42,786
Your Honor.

1378
01:40:44,455 --> 01:40:47,374
Whosa dis?

1379
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:50,419
I am Queen Amidala.
Huh?

1380
01:40:51,379 --> 01:40:53,296
This is my decoy,

1381
01:40:53,381 --> 01:40:56,758
my protection, my loyal bodyguard.

1382
01:40:56,843 --> 01:41:01,179
I'm sorry for my deception,
but it was necessary to protect myself.

1383
01:41:01,264 --> 01:41:04,182
Although we do not always agree, Your Honor,

1384
01:41:04,267 --> 01:41:07,185
our two great societies
have always lived in peace.

1385
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:09,187
- Ah.
- The Trade Federation...

1386
01:41:09,272 --> 01:41:11,481
has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build.

1387
01:41:11,566 --> 01:41:14,901
If we do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.

1388
01:41:14,986 --> 01:41:17,237
I ask you to help us.

1389
01:41:17,321 --> 01:41:20,073
No, I beg you to help us.

1390
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:22,534
We are your humble servants.

1391
01:41:24,996 --> 01:41:28,582
Our fate is in your hands.

1392
01:41:28,666 --> 01:41:31,168
Mmm.

1393
01:41:33,463 --> 01:41:35,172

[All Cheering, Shouting]

01:42:08,206 --> 01:42:11,124
Yippee! Ya-hoo!

1405
01:42:11,209 --> 01:42:13,543
We've sent our patrols.

1406
01:42:13,628 --> 01:42:17,130
We already located
their starship in the swamp.

1407
01:42:17,215 --> 01:42:19,424
It won't be long, my lord.

1408
01:42:19,509 --> 01:42:22,677
This is an unexpected move for her.

1409
01:42:22,762 --> 01:42:24,804
It's too aggressive.

1410
01:42:24,889 --> 01:42:27,349
Lord Maul, be mindful.

1411
01:42:27,433 --> 01:42:30,018
Let them make the first move.

1412
01:42:30,102 --> 01:42:32,062
Yes, my master.

1413
01:42:35,525 --> 01:42:37,234
Deysa comin!

1414
01:42:37,318 --> 01:42:39,736
All right!

1415
01:42:41,572 --> 01:42:43,490
They're here!

1416
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:45,534
Good. They made it.

1417
01:42:50,039 --> 01:42:51,915

and da Naboo together.

1419
01:42:56,045 --> 01:42:57,963
Ah, no, no, no.

01:42:58,047 --> 01:43:01,049

1422
01:43:03,261 --> 01:43:05,679
General?

1423
01:43:05,763 --> 01:43:07,639
[Moaning]

1424
01:43:07,765 --> 01:43:09,766
[Qui-Gon]
Captain.
[Laughing]

1425
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:12,519
Your Highness.
What is the situation?

1426
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:14,521
Almost everyone's in camps.

1427
01:43:14,605 --> 01:43:17,857
A few hundred police and guards
have formed an underground resistance movement.

1428
01:43:17,942 --> 01:43:20,527
I brought back
as many of the leaders as I could.

1429
01:43:20,611 --> 01:43:25,282
The Federation army's also
much larger than we thought, and much stronger.

1430
01:43:25,366 --> 01:43:29,703
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

1431
01:43:29,787 --> 01:43:31,705
The battle is a diversion.

1432
01:43:31,789 --> 01:43:35,000
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.

1433
01:43:35,084 --> 01:43:37,669
R2.
[Beeps]

1434
01:43:37,753 --> 01:43:41,381
We can enter the city using the secret passages
on the waterfall side.

1435
01:43:41,465 --> 01:43:43,383
Once we get to the main entrance,

1436
01:43:43,467 --> 01:43:46,303
Captain Panaka will create a diversion.

1437
01:43:46,387 --> 01:43:49,347
Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.

1438
01:43:49,432 --> 01:43:52,726
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

1439
01:43:52,810 --> 01:43:54,728
What do you think, Master Jedi?

1440
01:43:54,812 --> 01:43:56,980
The viceroy will be well-guarded.

1441
01:43:57,064 --> 01:43:59,482
The difficulty is getting into the throne room.

1442
01:43:59,567 --> 01:44:02,027
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.

1443
01:44:02,111 --> 01:44:06,865
There is a possibility, with this diversion,
many Gungans will be killed.

1444
01:44:06,949 --> 01:44:10,285
Wesa ready to do our-san part.

1445
01:44:10,369 --> 01:44:13,580
[Amidala] We have a plan which should
immobilize the droid army.

1446
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:15,582
We will send what pilots we have...

1447
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:18,710
to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.

1448
01:44:18,794 --> 01:44:21,921
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.

1449
01:44:22,006 --> 01:44:24,924
The weapons on your fighters
may not penetrate the shields.

1450
01:44:25,009 --> 01:44:26,926
[Obi-Wan]
There's an even bigger danger.

1451
01:44:27,011 --> 01:44:28,928
If the viceroy escapes, Your Highness,

1452
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:31,264
he will return with another droid army.

1453
01:44:31,349 --> 01:44:34,601
Well, that is why we must not
fail to get the viceroy.

1454
01:44:34,685 --> 01:44:36,603
Everything depends on it.

1455
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:40,607
[Beeps, Whistles]

1456
01:44:42,026 --> 01:44:44,611
She is more foolish than I thought.

1457
01:44:44,695 --> 01:44:49,658
We are sending all troops to meet this army
assembling near the swamp.

1458
01:44:49,742 --> 01:44:52,452
It appears to be made up of primitives.

1459
01:44:52,536 --> 01:44:55,121
This will work to our advantage.

1460
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:57,999
I have your approval to proceed, then, my lord?

1461
01:44:58,084 --> 01:45:00,543
Wipe them out.

1462
01:45:02,213 --> 01:45:04,172
All of them.

1463
01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:21,189

1464
01:45:34,954 --> 01:45:36,913

1468
01:46:11,282 --> 01:46:12,824
Open fire.

1469
01:46:28,257 --> 01:46:32,177
Once we get inside,
you find a safe place to hide and stay there.

1470
01:46:32,303 --> 01:46:34,220
Sure.
Stay there.

1473
01:47:00,247 --> 01:47:03,374
I thought the battle
was going to take place far from here.

1474
01:47:03,459 --> 01:47:06,002
This is too close.

1475
01:47:11,091 --> 01:47:12,634

in the throne room.
