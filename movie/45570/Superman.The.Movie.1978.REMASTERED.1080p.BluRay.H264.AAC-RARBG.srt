{\fn幼圆}你指责我不听令行事?
You would accuse me of insurrection?

80
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,240
{\fn幼圆}现在对生命慈悲变成罪行了吗?

{\fn幼圆}这是唯一的出路

89
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,800
{\fn幼圆}你会死 就像我们会死一般

90
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,380
{\fn幼圆}但为何选地球?乔罗

He will need that advantage to survive.

93
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,890
{\fn幼圆}他们非常的正常

{\fn幼圆}那是他停留之地

{\fn幼圆}你会弄清楚他们的强夺性

100
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,590
{\fn幼圆}他会非常优秀与众不同
He'll be odd. Different.

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,600
{\fn幼圆}他会非常的快 终极上会非常的荣耀
He'll be fast. Virtually invulnerable.

102
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,180

103
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:29,600
{\fn幼圆}他不会是一个人

104
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,820
{\fn幼圆}永远不会是一个人
He will never be alone.

105
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,190
{\fn幼圆}他会旅行很远 我的小葛洛
You will travel far, my little Kal-El.

106
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,240
{\fn幼圆}我们永远不会离开你

107
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,570
{\fn幼圆}即使在我们面对死亡之时

108
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,830
{\fn幼圆}我们生命中丰富的一面

...I bequeath you, my son.

113
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,720
{\fn幼圆}你会在内心中负荷着我
You will carry me inside you...

114
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,020
{\fn幼圆}在你的一生中
...all the days of your life.

115
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,530
{\fn幼圆}你会把我的力量变成你自己的
You will make my strength your own...

116
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,820
{\fn幼圆}由你的眼中看到我的一生

{\fn幼圆}这是所有我所能…
This is all I...

121
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,760
{\fn幼圆}我所能给予你的 葛洛
...all I can send you, Kal-El.

122
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,920
{\fn幼圆}这是爱因斯坦所谓的相对论
... which Einstein called his theory of relativity.

123
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
{\fn幼圆}全都藏在你面前的水晶中

00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:52,200
{\fn幼圆}及你会经过的六个银行系
Each of the six galaxies which you will pass through...

134
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,280
{\fn幼圆}都拥有他们各自的法律
... contain their own individual law of space and time.

135
00:22:55,370 --> 00:23:02,090
{\fn幼圆}在太空中所不允许的 是干扰人类的历史

{\fn幼圆}不会全凑到一块了吗? 你能不能…
Now wouldn't that beat all get out. Well, you...

141
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,200
{\fn幼圆}我一直向上帝祈祷 给我们一个孩子
...how I've prayed the good Lord would see fit to give us a child.

142
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,900
{\fn幼圆}亲爱的 请把那抹布递给我
Honey, will you hand me that rag up there.

143
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,780
{\fn幼圆}你最好慢慢来 强纳森
You take things easy now.

144
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,740
{\fn幼圆}记住费莱医生所说的你的心脏
Remember what Doc Frye said about that heart of yours.

145
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,230
{\fn幼圆}我们回家后所要做的第一件事 就是要查出
Now the first thing we've got to do when we get home is find out...

146
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,340
{\fn幼圆}那男孩是那一家的
...who that boy's proper family is.

147
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,090
{\fn幼圆}他没有家 总之不是在这一带
He hasn't got any. Not around here, anyway.

148
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:26,020
{\fn幼圆}马莎 你是否在想我以为你在想的?
Martha, Are you thinking what I think you are thinking?

149
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,250
{\fn幼圆}我们可以说他是我们在北卡州 表兄的孩子
We could say he's the child of my cousin in North Dakota...

150
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,150
{\fn幼圆}而现在是孤儿了
...and just now orphaned.

151
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,370
{\fn幼圆}老马莎
Old Martha.

152
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,940
{\fn幼圆}强纳森 他只是个孩子
Jonathan, he's only a baby.

153
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:43,830

Martha, now you saw how we found him.

154
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:48,270
{\fn幼圆}马莎克拉克肯  你听到我说的话了吗?
Martha Clark Kent, are you listening to what I'm saying?

155
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:53,260

161
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,340

...by tomorrow, and looking like a football team.

162
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,050
{\fn幼圆}克拉克 全得为明天的比赛洗好
Let's have those clothes washed and ready for tomorrow's game.

163

Don't bother with these. I'll take them in with the other equipment.

167
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:02,660
{\fn幼圆}谢谢 克拉克 当然
- Thank you, Clark. - Sure.

{\fn幼圆}听我说 我们一大群要去马丽欧兰斯
Listen, a whole bunch of us are going up to Mary Ellen's.

Kent can't make it. Still got a lot of work to do.

173

What are you talking about? I've just finished stacking...

175
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,970

184
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,420
{\fn幼圆}看 克拉克在那
Hey, look, there's Clark!

185
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,260
{\fn幼圆}他怎么可能在这边?
Oh, how could him here?

186
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,460
{\fn幼圆}克拉克

187
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,130
{\fn幼圆}你怎么能这么快的到这的?
How did you get here so fast?

188
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,170
{\fn幼圆}我跑来的
I ran.

189
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,680
{\fn幼圆}跑的?
Ran, huh?

190
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:49,510
{\fn幼圆}我告诉过你们他是个怪胎 我们快离开这里
Told you he was an oddball, let's get out of here.

191
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,100
{\fn幼圆}眩耀了一下 是吧?儿子
Been showing off a bit, haven't you, Son?

192
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,830
{\fn幼圆}我不是故意要眩耀的 爸
I didn't mean to show off, Pa.

193
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:17,300
{\fn幼圆}只是那个叫布莱得的家伙 我想把他撕成碎片
It's just that guys like that Brad, I just want to tear them apart.

194
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,500
{\fn幼圆}是 我知道 我知道
Yeah, I know.

195
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,840
{\fn幼圆}是 我知道我不应该
Yeah, I know I shouldn't.

196
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,760
{\fn幼圆}是 我知道你能做这些奇妙的事
Yeah, I know you can do all these amazing things...

197
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,590
{\fn幼圆}有时你想 若不能告诉别人
...and sometimes you think that you will just go bust...

198
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,640
{\fn幼圆}你会爆掉的
...unless you can tell people about it.

199
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,010
{\fn幼圆}是没错
- Yeah. - That's right.

200
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,060
{\fn幼圆}每次我打橄榄球都能触地得分的
I mean, every time I get the football I can make a touchdown.

201
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,980
{\fn幼圆}这我确定 每一次
- That's for sure. - Every time.

202
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:38,860
{\fn幼圆}我是说让别人在做的事 而他也能做
Is it showing off when somebody's doing the things he's capable of doing?

203
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,940
{\fn幼圆}那是眩耀吗?
Is a bird showing off when it flies?

204
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:44,370
{\fn幼圆}不 你听我说
No, now, you listen to me.

205
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:45,410
{\fn幼圆}当你刚到我们身边时 我们认为...
When you came to us, we thought...

206
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,580
{\fn幼圆}别人发现你所能做的事
...people would take you away...

207
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,420
{\fn幼圆}他们会把你由我们身边带走
...when they found out the things that you do.

208
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,340
{\fn幼圆}而那非常令我们担忧
It worried us a lot.

209
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:56,870
{\fn幼圆}而当我们逐渐老了 非常的不同
Then when a man gets older and he thinks very differently.

210
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,170
{\fn幼圆}事情也变的非常清楚
And things get very clear.

211
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:04,600
{\fn幼圆}有一件事我很清楚 儿子 那就是你来这是有原因的
And there's one thing I do know, Son, and that is you are here for a reason.

212
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,640
{\fn幼圆}我不知道谁是那个原因 或不管那原因是什么 你知道吗
I don't know whose reason, or whatever the reason is...

213
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,300
{\fn幼圆}也许只是因为…
...maybe it's because...

214
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:14,560
{\fn幼圆}我不知道 那是…
I don't know.

215
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:23,610
{\fn幼圆}但我的确知道一件事 那不是触地得分的分数
But I do know one thing. It's not to score touchdowns.

216
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,110
{\fn幼圆}谢谢 爸
Thanks, Dad.

217
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,490

Oh, no.

222
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:51,630
{\fn幼圆}但…
But...

223
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:06,290
{\fn幼圆}强纳森
Jonathan?

224
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:07,950
{\fn幼圆}强纳森

225
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,290
{\fn幼圆}爸?
Dad.

226
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:26,670
{\fn幼圆}强纳森
Jonathan.

227
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,680

{\fn幼圆}不
No.

230
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,800
{\fn幼圆}我能做的那些事情
All those things I can do...

231
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,510
{\fn幼圆}那些力量
...all those powers...

232
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,720
{\fn幼圆}而我甚至救不了他
...and I couldn't even save him.

233
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,600
{\fn幼圆}我必须走了
I have to leave.

234
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:14,070
{\fn幼圆}我知道这个时刻会来的
I knew this time would come.

235
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,030
{\fn幼圆}我们两在找到你的那一天就晓得
We both knew it from the day we found you.

236
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,010
{\fn幼圆}我昨天和班哈
I talked to Ben Hubbard yesterday.

237
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:41,020
{\fn幼圆}他说 从今以后他很乐意来帮忙
He said that he'd be happy to help out from now on.

238
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,360

Mother!

239
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,070

240
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,650
{\fn幼圆}我知道

241
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,830
{\fn幼圆}你知道…你要往那去吗?
Do you know where you're headed?

242
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,460

243
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,630

245
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:56,560
{\fn幼圆}我的儿子
My son...

246
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:06,970
{\fn幼圆}你不会记得我

247
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:08,360
{\fn幼圆}我是乔罗
I am Jor-El.

248
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,450
{\fn幼圆}我是你的父亲

249
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:16,980

By now you will have reached your eighteenth year...

250
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:18,830
{\fn幼圆}那是在地球上的算法
... as it is measured on Earth.

251
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:22,000
{\fn幼圆}在那个时刻 以你们的算法
By that reckoning...

252
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:25,750
{\fn幼圆}我已经死了好几千年了
... I will have been dead for many thousands of your years.

253
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,550
{\fn幼圆}我所拥有的
The knowledge...

254
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,010
{\fn幼圆}生理及历史上的知识

255
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:37,720
{\fn幼圆}在你的新家中我会彻底传授给你
... I have given you fully on your voyage to your new home.

256
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:41,780
{\fn幼圆}那是很重要的事务
These are important matters to be sure...

257
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,190
{\fn幼圆}但事实仍然是很重要的
... but still matters of mere fact.

258
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,730
{\fn幼圆}而你所要问的问题
There are questions to be asked...

259
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:53,020

888
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:31,390
{\fn幼圆}可能有他们自己的太阳系
...and the proximity to our own solar system...

889
01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:37,730
{\fn幼圆}那真的太奇妙了 太奇妙了
It's amazing. Amazing!

890
01:34:37,930 --> 01:34:39,060
{\fn幼圆}好的不像是真的
Too good to be true.

891
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:42,400

It's too good to be true. 6' 4", black hair, blue eyes...

892
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:43,880
{\fn幼圆}不抽烟不喝酒而且说实话
...doesn't drink or smoke and tells the truth.

893
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:45,030
{\fn幼圆}黛丝马克小姐
Miss Teschmacher.

894
01:34:45,230 --> 01:34:48,050
{\fn幼圆}有人能看战争与和平
Some people can read War and Peace...

895
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:49,890
{\fn幼圆}而把它看成单纯的冒险故事
...and think it was an adventure story.

896
01:34:50,090 --> 01:34:52,890
{\fn幼圆}有人能看口香糖的包装纸
Others can read the ingredients on a gum wrapper...

897
01:34:53,090 --> 01:34:57,050
{\fn幼圆}而破解宇宙的连锁
...and unlock the secrets of the universe.

898
01:34:57,700 --> 01:35:04,060
{\fn幼圆}赖克斯 口香糖和宇宙的连锁 又有什么关系?
Lex, what has chewing gum got to do with the secrets of the universe?

899
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:05,960
{\fn幼圆}对的 对的 黛丝马克小姐
Right, Miss Teschmacher.

900
01:35:09,590 --> 01:35:11,090
{\fn幼圆}以及…以及

901
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:15,080
{\fn幼圆}M 你要M部份?路梭先生 马上就到
"M"? You want "M," Mr. Luthor? Coming right up.

902
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:17,600
{\fn幼圆}好了 到了 M部份
So there you go, "M."

903
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:18,920
{\fn幼圆}M是代表神经病
"M" as in "moron," Otis? No.

904
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:22,060

{\fn幼圆}我只是没看...
I didn't see...

908
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:31,240
{\fn幼圆}我很抱歉 路梭先生
I'm sorry, Mr. Luthor.

909
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:36,160
{\fn幼圆}在专访中说克莱顿星…
In the interview he says that the Planet Krypton...

910
01:35:37,140 --> 01:35:40,110
{\fn幼圆}1948年爆炸了
...exploded in 1948.

911
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:42,460
{\fn幼圆}那荒谬的怪谈
That ridiculous little freak...

912
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:45,380
{\fn幼圆}花了三年陨石才到达地球
...took three years in a rocket to get to earth.

913
01:35:46,130 --> 01:35:47,750
{\fn幼圆}- 这里开始了 - 这里开始了
- Ergo... - Ergo.

914
01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:51,120
{\fn幼圆}1948年 花了三年…
Ergo 1948, that's three years on.

915
01:35:51,550 --> 01:35:51,950
{\fn幼圆}他身高6尺4寸 你知道吗?
He's 6' 4", you know that?

916
01:35:52,150 --> 01:35:58,120
{\fn幼圆}你知道为何两百这数字 和你我都有关系吗?
Do you know why the number 200 is so vitally descriptive to both you and me?

917
01:35:58,560 --> 01:35:58,960
{\fn幼圆}是你的体重与我的智商
It's your weight and my I.Q.

918
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:02,130
{\fn幼圆}现在 人们 想想看 想想看
Think, people, think.

919
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:07,120
{\fn幼圆}综合那些理由 那是那游戏之名
Deductive reasoning. That's the name of the game.

920
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:10,140
{\fn幼圆}克莱顿星的物质在爆炸时
Fragments from the Planet Krypton...

921
01:36:10,570 --> 01:36:12,650
{\fn幼圆}进入了外太空
...exploded and went into outer space.

922
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:14,610
{\fn幼圆}假设其中的部分...
It is reasonable to assume...

923
01:36:14,740 --> 01:36:17,740
{\fn幼圆}坠落在地球是有道理的...that some of those particles of debris
drifted to Earth.

924
01:36:20,660 --> 01:36:21,580
{\fn幼圆}陨石
Meteorites!

925
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:40,160
{\fn幼圆}在阿利斯阿拉巴发现一块陨石
A meteorite found in Addis Ababa?

926
01:36:40,930 --> 01:36:43,390
{\fn幼圆}我知道我要因此到山上走一遭 但是…
I know I'll get rapped in the mouth for this, but...

927
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:44,640
{\fn幼圆}又怎么样?
...so what?

928
01:36:45,270 --> 01:36:47,940
{\fn幼圆}你是说对我们它只是块陨石
So what? You mean to us they're just meteorites.

929
01:36:48,860 --> 01:36:49,820
{\fn幼圆}很公平
Fair enough.

930
01:36:50,770 --> 01:36:53,280
{\fn幼圆}但它的辐射线的水准是那么高
But the level of specific radioactivity...

931
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:56,030
{\fn幼圆}这东西对来自克莱顿的人而言
...is so high to anyone from the Planet Krypton...

932
01:36:56,450 --> 01:36:58,030
{\fn幼圆}是致命物质
...this substance is lethal.

933
01:36:58,700 --> 01:37:00,160
{\fn幼圆}等一下 路梭先生
Wait a minute, Mr. Luthor.

934
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:02,020
{\fn幼圆}你是说火与子弹不能伤到这家伙
Fire and bullets can't hurt this guy...

935
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:04,790
{\fn幼圆}而这里的这个东西…
...but this stuff here...

936
01:37:04,870 --> 01:37:07,040
{\fn幼圆}会杀了他
...will kill him.

937
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:12,500
{\fn幼圆}和我待在同一间房里
Doesn't it give you a kind of...

938
01:37:12,590 --> 01:37:16,300
{\fn幼圆}对你们不是种震惊或电击吗?
...a shudder of electricity through you to be in the same room with me?

939
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:20,850
{\fn幼圆}不会比你试着把那块石头 装到他身上时更震惊
Not like the shudder you'll get when you lay that rock on him.

940
01:37:20,970 --> 01:37:24,220
{\fn幼圆}你以他的千里眼能看到 你从几哩路以外来了
He can see you coming for miles with those super peepers of his.

941
01:37:24,430 --> 01:37:28,210
{\fn幼圆}我的天  你给了他们双眼但却看不见
O Lord, you gave them eyes, but they cannot see...

942
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:30,650
{\fn幼圆}即使是超人也不能看透铅
...nor can Superman, through lead.

943
01:37:32,690 --> 01:37:34,050
{\fn幼圆}他不能看透铅
He can't see through lead?

944
01:37:34,250 --> 01:37:39,210
{\fn幼圆}而克莱顿的陨石会毁灭他
And Kryptonite will destroy him.

945
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:43,230
{\fn幼圆}有任何问题吗?学生们
Any questions, class?

946
01:37:43,830 --> 01:37:46,120
{\fn幼圆}不知道在阿利斯阿拉巴穿着什么
I wonder what they're wearing in Addis Ababa?

947
01:37:46,790 --> 01:37:48,250
{\fn幼圆}看起来像是僧袍 你知道…
Looks like a burnoose.

948
01:37:48,370 --> 01:37:50,540
{\fn幼圆}我们走 要24…
It's just a wraparound.

949
01:37:50,670 --> 01:37:53,070
{\fn幼圆}我们要去阿利斯阿拉巴? 路梭先生
Are we going to Addis Ababa, Mr. Luthor?

950
01:37:53,270 --> 01:37:56,510
{\fn幼圆}母鸟对飞弹运输队 请回答
Mother Bird to Missile Convoy, over.

951
01:37:56,970 --> 01:37:59,220
{\fn幼圆}这是运输队对母鸟 请讲
Missile Convoy to Mother Bird, go ahead.

952
01:37:59,470 --> 01:38:03,390
{\fn幼圆}一切看起来都很好 基地见了 通话完毕
Everything looks good, see you at the base. Over and out.

953
01:38:03,890 --> 01:38:06,270
{\fn幼圆}知道了 母鸟 通话完毕
Roger, Mother Bird. Over and out.

954
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:50,640
{\fn幼圆}看看这个
Look at this!

955
01:38:51,350 --> 01:38:52,560
{\fn幼圆}蛮严重的
Looks pretty bad.

956
01:38:56,340 --> 01:39:01,300
{\fn幼圆}最好量一下她的脉博
Take her pulse.

957
01:39:08,950 --> 01:39:10,660
{\fn幼圆}好了 用无线电叫辆救护车来
Get an ambulance down here.

958
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:14,040
{\fn幼圆}我不想把全部的人都挡在这里
I don't want to hold this convoy up more than I have to.

959
01:39:14,130 --> 01:39:16,470
{\fn幼圆}她呼吸有困难 长官 你认为呢
She's having trouble breathing. What do you think?

960
01:39:16,670 --> 01:39:19,670
{\fn幼圆}我建议给她做点胸部按摩
I suggest a vigorous chest massage.

961
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:22,260
{\fn幼圆}再做…口对口人工呼吸
If that doesn't work, mouth-to-mouth.

962
01:39:22,340 --> 01:39:23,340
{\fn幼圆}是的 长官
Yes, sir!

963
01:39:24,970 --> 01:39:28,330
{\fn幼圆}中士 我不会让我的人 做任何我不会亲自做的事
I won't have my men do anything I wouldn't be prepared to do myself.

964
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:29,730
{\fn幼圆}是 但是 长官去叫救护车
Get an ambulance.

965

{\fn幼圆}好了 弟兄们 靠在一起
Gather around.

966
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:34,020
{\fn幼圆}向后转
Turn around!

967
01:40:02,220 --> 01:40:03,220

01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:24,390
{\fn幼圆}我办到了 路梭先生

It isn't that I don't trust you, but...

973
01:40:32,430 --> 01:40:35,240
{\fn幼圆}我不信任你 欧帝斯你做了什么
I don't trust you, Otis. What did you do?

974
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:40,400
{\fn幼圆}我将第一组导向器
I set the first directional vector...

975
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:42,260
{\fn幼圆}设定在38上

The third one was supposed to be 11, and the fourth one, 7.

982
01:41:03,490 --> 01:41:05,650
{\fn幼圆}哦 路梭先生

I guess my arm wasn't long enough, see.

984
01:41:07,470 --> 01:41:10,870

Would you like to see a long arm?

01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:14,660
{\fn幼圆}欧帝斯 你想要有很长的手臂吗
Otis, would you like to see a very, very, long arm?

Back that thing off the road. Back it off the road.

{\fn幼圆}好了 听着 你必须调头回去 我没时间和你争执
You'll have to circle back. I don't have time to argue.

993
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:04,920
{\fn幼圆}你开回你来的地方 行吗?
It's a heck of a day, isn't it?

994
01:42:10,530 --> 01:42:11,500
{\fn幼圆}那是12号道路
Route 12.

995
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:15,500
{\fn幼圆}12号道路 那是在那后面 不是吗?不 长官 在那上面
- Route 12? That's back there. - No, sir, it's up there.

996
01:42:15,540 --> 01:42:17,500
{\fn幼圆}你确定吗?你们是打那来的?

997
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:24,500
{\fn幼圆}中士 我们转错弯了 我是上尉 你在和海军军官说话
- Sergeant, we took the wrong road. - I'm a Lieutenant. A Naval Officer.

998
01:42:28,550 --> 01:42:33,510
{\fn幼圆}闭嘴 现在12号道路在哪条路后面了
Shut up! Now Route 12 is back that way.

999
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:41,080
{\fn幼圆}这个人有糖尿病 你知道吗?
This man is a diabetic, you see.

1000
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:55,380
{\fn幼圆}如同你所知 我们的星球日报社 对那便宜的地价觉得很有趣
As you know, the Daily Planet is very interested in that dam...

1001
01:42:55,580 --> 01:42:58,140
{\fn幼圆}但是我所不了解的是
...but what I don't understand...

1002
01:42:58,230 --> 01:43:01,230
{\fn幼圆}你为何会卖给一个素未谋面之人
...is why you'd sell out to a faceless person you've never met?

1003
01:43:01,310 --> 01:43:02,690
{\fn幼圆}我是说你甚至不知他的姓名
You don't know his name.

1004
01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:07,390
{\fn幼圆}在他对这一无用处的沙漠
At the stupid high price he offered...

1005
01:43:07,590 --> 01:43:10,390
{\fn幼圆}所开出来那么离谱的高价之后
...for this worthless piece of desert...

1006
01:43:10,590 --> 01:43:14,550
{\fn幼圆}我希望它是坏地方
...I hope it's Custer!

1007
