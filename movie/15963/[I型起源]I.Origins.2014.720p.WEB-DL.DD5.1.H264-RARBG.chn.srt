        in one instant.

Happy because she sees that,

be a glorified note taker,

"Z" as in Zoolander,

131
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,938

color-blind mice

135
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,315
stare straight.

136
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,317

00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:22,253
fingers crossed...

138
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:24,823
the muted mice... shh...

139

Holy fucking shit.

141

 I can put together a sentence.

145
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:45,877
      Sorry, I... I asked
  my last three lab assistants

146
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,313
         not to come in
  and I'd sign their credits.

147
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:51,683
Anyway,
this is just one step

148
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:55,320
in a very, very long... process.

149
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:58,156
  This is a rough estimation,

150
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,191
       but let's just say
       that the human eye

151
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,260
  has 12 working parts, right?

152
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,095
Simplest eye having one.

153
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,231
So if we can
fill in the gaps--

154
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,332
the evolutionary gaps--

155
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,835
    using single mutations,

156
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:14,039
         we can map out
  the most logical progression

157
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,274
    of the most basic eye...

158
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:20,278
      to the most complex,
    fully formed human eye.

159
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,914
I don't understand--
why take the time?

160
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,916
    We know that it evolved.

161
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:27,686
             It's an assumption;
                it's not a fact.

162
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:31,322
     When you're no longer
    a first-year, you'll see

163
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,091
        how important facts are.

164
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,793
             Right.

165
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:40,331
Each of these animals has an eye

166
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,001
      that's best selected
      for its environment.

167
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,071
         It would be...

168
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,006
   cleaner-- less variables--

169
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:50,408
    if you... had an origin.

170
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,178
             Go on.

171
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,246
You start with one...

172
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:56,748
         to get to 12.

173
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,017
   But what if you had zero--

174
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,252
    a non-seeing organism--

175
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:04,322
    and built, genetically,
      an eye from scratch,

176
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,157
         a zero to 12?

177
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,127
    It'd be a perfect proof,
         unassailable.

178
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:12,997
      Non-seeing organisms
   don't have the PAX6 gene.

179
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:16,167
  How do you know? Has anyone
   ever checked all of them?

180
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:19,738
      I don't think anyone
      has ever checked...

181
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,272
          all of them.

182
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,843
 You've thought of this before?

183
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,378
  Why did you look surprised?

184
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,781
      Because so have you.

185
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,453
             Okay.

186
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,294
Who were those girls?

187
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:47,365
Which girls?
                 The ones at the
                 Halloween party

188
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,400
      in the S&M outfits.

189
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,236
        S&M outfits...?

190
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,538
            I-I met one of them;
          I don't know her name.

191
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,508
   I don't know her face, but
she had these most amazing eyes.

192
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,910
          So specific.

193
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,178
     Central heterochromia.

194
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,514
    Oh, reminds me.

195
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:04,382
Guess what I did.

196
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:05,850
             What?

197
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,919
  I... figured out an improved

198
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,220
    implementation technique

199
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:12,357
for Daugman's
biometrics algo.

200
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:14,459
You ever feel like
     when you met someone,

201
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,060
      they fill this hole
         inside of you,

202
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,362
 and then when they're gone...

203
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:21,299
      you feel that space
       painfully vacant?

204
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,269
       Are you okay, man?

205
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,173
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

206
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:29,407
         Are you okay?

207
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,576
     What did you just say?
        Did you just...

208
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:33,578
    The way you talked was,
         like, poetic.

209
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,880
It was weird.
               Shut the fuck up.

210
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:38,016
        So weird, dude,
       I can't believe...

211
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,851
           Oh, shit.

212
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,389
 This guy is painfully vacant.

213
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,391
Ian, look at him--
he's so painfully va...

214
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:49,994
   He's so painfully vacant.

215
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,197
Fuck off.

216
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,072
 Can I get a-a pack of Verdict

217
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,241
        and a Powerball?

218
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:08,112
How much is that?

219
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:11,983
                         $11.11.

Karen.
Mm-hmm?

233
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,198
      What are you doing?

234
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,667
  Five percent of all animals
       don't have vision,

235
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,037
         and there are
      8.7 million species.

236
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,773
       So I blasted PAX6
        at the database,

237
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:23,508
but nothing came up.

238
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,143
So I started sequencing
by myself.

239
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,245
      How many did you sequence?

240
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,816
              12.
                 You've done 12.

241
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:35,219
                  So how many do
                  you have left?

242
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:39,323
Like, approximately
426,000.

243
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:43,628
          Are you going to write
                   426,000 names

244
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,396
                  on the window?

245
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,835
I'm going to find it before
I get to the end of the window.

246
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:52,203
             Okay.

247
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:54,172
What are you doing?

248
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,542
 I'm... I'm not doing anything.

264
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,996
 So many places, I don't know.

265
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:42,500
         Which places?

266
00:21:42,502 --> 00:21:44,802
             Mm...

267
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:48,673
       To make it short,
    I was born in Argentina,

268
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:52,510
   and when I was 11, I moved
 to France with my grandmother.

269
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:59,383
     And your-your parents?

270
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,420
             Next.

271
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:09,026
So, what do you do?

272
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:10,461
                           Next.

273
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:19,337
       Why did you sleep
      with me that night?

274
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,873
         Poor judgment.

275
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,713
          I was lonely
    for a long time, and...

276
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,684
 ...when I saw you that night,

277
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:37,555
     I... I had the feeling
     that I had known you.

278
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:40,958
     Actually, I felt like
          you knew me.

279
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,428
       What do you mean?

280
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,599
     Like we are connected
        from past lives.

281
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:52,069
    I don't believe in that.

282
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:56,774
    What do you believe in?

283
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:59,443
        I'm a scientist;
       I believe in data.

284
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:00,878
                    A scientist?
            Mm-hmm.

285
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,480
    What kind of scientist?

286
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:03,781
Molecular biology.

287
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:06,517
      I'm most fascinated
         with the eye.

288
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,985
    The eye... the-the eyes?

289
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,120
The eyes.
                    Why the eye?

290
00:23:09,122 --> 00:23:10,788
The eye is

291
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,790
     the one sticking point
   that religious people use

00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:18,129
  They use it as proof of a...
     intelligent designer.

294
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:19,964
    Intelligent designer...?

295
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:21,732
God.

296
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:25,436
 I'm looking to end the debate
    once and for all with...

297
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,474
     ...clear, clean facts.

298
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:32,610
   Data points of every stage
       of eye evolution.

299
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:36,614
  Why are you working so hard
        to disprove God?

300
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:39,784
 Disprove? Who proved that God
 was there in the first place?

301
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:45,489
Anyway,
let's get some real

302
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:47,124
   data points on you, okay?

303
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:48,559
                    Be my guest.

304
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:51,195
        I prefer talking
     about myself anyways.

305
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:53,097
Okay.

306

   <i> I'll take you to see it.</i>

342
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,209
   I start to see these elevens,
               like, everywhere.

343
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:46,911
               Too many elevens.

344
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:50,281
                  The amount was
     so staggering, so unlikely,

345
00:25:50,283 --> 00:25:53,150
           that I followed them.

346
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,619
       And when I followed them,
              I found your eyes,

347
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:58,055
       which then led me to you.

348
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,291
             Because I found you
              through your eyes.

349
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:03,060
                Also unlikely...

350
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,162
               like life itself.

351
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:08,799
            I know.

352
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:10,801
      I sent them to you.

353
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,770
                       Bullshit.

354
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,842
You know you have it.

355
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:20,811
                      Have what?
But you're scared of it.

356
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,249
                    I have what?

357
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,358
             Okay.

358
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,031
 You live in this room, right?

359
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,199
                         Mm-hmm.

360
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,134
            Reality.

361
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:47,805
You have a bed, you have books,

362
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:51,675
  um, a desk, a chair, lamps.

363
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:54,144
             Logic.

364
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:55,980
       But in this room,

365
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:58,716
you have a door...

366
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:00,050
to the other side.

367
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,988
              See?

368
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,358
      Light comes through.

369
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,259
           It's open

370
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:14,231
just a tiny bit,
but it is open.

371
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:18,202
You keep trying to close
that door because you're scared.

372
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:23,140
But you won't always
be scared.

373
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,345
What's behind the door?

374
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:30,214
Besides my dirty laundry.

375
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:32,216
                  You have to go
                 in to find out.

376
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,953
You know
what I'm talking about.

377
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,292
                 I have no idea.

378
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:44,795
You will.

379
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:46,764
You will.

380
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,867
             Oh...

381
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:52,136
 You want to move to my place?

382
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:53,671
You have a place?

383
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:56,006
              Mm-hmm. Of course.

384
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,676
Can I move in tomorrow?

385

Is this your family?

389
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:37,114
       Yes, it's my grandmother.

390
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,151
   Such an eccentric beauty.

391
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:44,221
             And...

          Um, the white peacock.

00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:56,867
                    But you have
                 met him before.

395
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:58,969
                             Mm!

396
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:02,306
        This is a proof

                           What?

399
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:08,345
  It's the name of the statue,
         of the statue

400
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:10,080
         in St. Anne's Cemetery.

401
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,315
It's in
St. Anne's Cemetery?

402
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:12,850
                         Mm-hmm.

403
00:29:12,852 --> 00:29:15,152
           But look at the eyes.

404
00:29:15,154 --> 00:29:17,821
They're alive.

405
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:19,423
Yeah.

406
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,825
It's amazing what you can do
on Photoshop these days.

407
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:24,061
There's no Photoshop!

408
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:29,066
The eyes appeared
just when she took the picture.

00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:30,334
Just...

              fortune await you.

If you find that PAX6 gene,

we'll be well on our way

00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,971
     Well, it is important
that people know about the work.

420
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:12,810
  To me, the best thing about
    living like a lab rat...

421
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:15,946
      is that sometimes...

422
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:18,182
       really rare times,

423
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:21,585
                    you actually
             discover something.

424
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:27,224
  On the night of a discovery,
   when you're lying in bed,

425
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:31,028
   you are the only person in
the world that knows it's true.

426
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:46,910
                 Can you promise
                   me something?

427
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:48,545
Promise you something?
                         Mm-hmm.

428
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:50,180
What?

429
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,882
                        Promise.

430
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:53,550
I can't promise
if you don't tell me what...

431
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:55,052
                  Promise first.

432
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:57,955
Before you tell me
what it is?
                         Mm-hmm.

433
00:30:57,957 --> 00:31:00,390
I keep my promises.

434
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:02,860
         Whatever, I won't tell.

435
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:04,628
                        Promise.

436
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:09,233
Okay, I promise.

437
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:11,101
          I want you to burn me.

00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:12,436
Burn you?

439
00:31:12,438 --> 00:31:14,504
             I don't want to rot
            in a box when I die.

440
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:16,874
Oh, you mean like
cremate you.

441
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:17,975
                       Mm, yeah.

442
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:19,276
Oh, no, no.

443
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:20,878
I don't want to be cremated.

444
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:27,184
   This is a big disagreement
     I didn't know we had.

445
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:29,953
Cremation
           is like obliteration.

446
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:32,422
I mean, what if in the future,
the scientists...

447
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:36,660
what if they can reconstitute
ourselves through our DNA?

448
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:39,429
I want to be clear with you.

449
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:41,198
                            Hmm?
I don't want that.

450
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,033
            You don't want what?

451
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:44,968
I don't want to be cloning.

452
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,103
"Cl-Cloneed." Cl...

453
00:31:46,105 --> 00:31:47,437
 "I don't want to be cloning."

454
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:50,374
"Cloneed."

455
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:53,343
        No, but I'd reconstitute
                   myself first,

456
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:55,545
and then I'd reconstitute you,
and then I'd ask you,

457
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:57,648
"Do you want to be alive?"

458
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,550
And then if you didn't,
I'd kill you.

459
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,226
        No, but then we could be
   together forever, like, like,

460
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:11,495
       for real, scientifically.
You can't do...

461
00:32:11,497 --> 00:32:13,597
      Reanimated, reconstituted.

462
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,068
You have a hard time
letting go.

463
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,704
          Don't worry.

464
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:23,307
  We'll find each other again.

465
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:36,219
       I love your smell.

466
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:37,955
          What is it?

467
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:39,323
                   I won't tell.

468
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:40,457
       Come on, tell me.

469
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:43,627
                      Mm-mm. Mm.

470
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,098
       Will you marry me?

471
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,236
              ¶ ¶

472
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:00,544
Next?

473
00:33:00,546 --> 00:33:02,045
Can I help you?

474
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:03,347
We'd like to get married.

475
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:04,548
Do you have
your I.D.'s?

476
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,516
             Yeah.
                            Yes.

477
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:13,123
Okay, first you have
to get your marriage license,

478
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:14,291
so you have to
fill these out.

479
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:15,459
             Okay.
Okay.

480
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:17,995
You're gonna have
to wait 24 hours

481
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:19,529
before you can
actually get married.

482
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:20,697
                      24 hours?!

483
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:22,065
Yeah.
                      Why?

484
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:23,533
        Well, this way,
       you have 24 hours

485
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:25,502
   to decide whether you want
    to marry this young man.

486
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,270
                      But I want
                   to marry him!

487
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:29,706
In 24 hours.

488
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:32,275
             So...
     Okay. All right. Yeah.

489
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:35,479
 So we can't get married today.

490
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:38,782
Okay...

491
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,153
This system really...

492
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:46,390
           kills the spontaneity
                    factor, huh?

493
00:33:46,392 --> 00:33:48,692
We're already married
in the spirit world.

494
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,195
Shit.

495
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,430
             Hello?

496
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:54,564
Hi.

497
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:55,565
                    Hi.

498
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:57,267
              Hi.

499
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:59,536
         Hi. What's up?
 You called, like, five times.

500
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,771
             I did.

501
00:34:00,773 --> 00:34:02,806
    Why-why would I do that?

502
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:04,808
  Why might I call five times?

503
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,443
                   I don't know.

504
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:08,311
       I was running the
    electrophoretic drill--

505
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:10,313
           you know,
     just another Tuesday--

506
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:12,349
         and I started
      sequencing the genes

507
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:16,153
      of this strange worm
     called<i> Eisenia fetida.</i>

508
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:17,554
             Go on.

509
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,456
           And, uh...

510
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:22,292
       I-I found the PAX6
         master switch.

511
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,228
              No.

512
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,397
             Yeah.
   Are you serious right now?

513
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,633
      You fucking with me?
  Do you know what this means?

514
00:34:29,635 --> 00:34:31,301
  We found an origin species,

515
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:33,470
and we can build
      an eye from scratch.

516
00:34:33,472 --> 00:34:36,306
          Holy sh...!

517
00:34:38,177 --> 00:34:40,477
       Um, uh, does it...
          does it have

518
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:42,345
  the same amino acid sequence
           as humans?

519
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:43,513
I-I can't even...

520
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:44,815
  I can't even talk right now.

521
00:34:44,817 --> 00:34:46,616
          I feel like
     I'm gonna piss myself.

522
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:48,085
   Can you just come in here?

523
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:49,219
 Okay, I'm coming in right now.

524
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:50,220
        You're amazing.

525
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:51,855
              Bye. Bye-bye. Bye.

526
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,392
         Who was that?

527
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:56,860
           That was Karen, uh...

528
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:58,261
                  my rotating...

529
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:00,464
         well... my lab partner.

530
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:04,501
               I have to go into
             the lab, right now.

531
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:07,504
    Do you want to come with me?
On our wedding day?

532
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,407
   It's... well, it's not...

533
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:12,609
          technically,
it's not our wedding day today.

534
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,845
         And we've been
       married... forever

535
00:35:14,847 --> 00:35:17,114
 in the spiritual world, right?

536
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:19,249
                   Sofi, please,
                come in with me.

537
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:20,450
          It's really important.

538
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,685
             Sure.

539
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:23,553
                           Yeah?

540
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:25,622
         Mm. It's fine.
           Let's go.

541
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,291
                Well, d... don't
              be upset about it.

542
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,160
Let's put our rings on.

543
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:31,728
                I don't want to;
                  it's bad luck.

544
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,730
I don't believe in luck.

545
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,200
I do believe we've
known each other

546
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:40,170
since forever, though.

547
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:41,438
            Really?

548
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,807
Yeah.
You know how?

549
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:47,410
When the big bang
happened,

550
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:49,913
 all the atoms in the universe,
 they were all smashed together

551
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:52,883
      into one little dot
     that exploded outward.

552
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:56,219
   So my atoms and your atoms
 were certainly together then,

553
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:57,721
  and, who knows, probably...

554
00:35:57,723 --> 00:36:01,424
smashed together several
times in the last 13.7

555
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:03,727
billion years.

556
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:07,297
So my atoms have
known your atoms...

557
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:10,400
and they've always
known your atoms.

558
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:13,637
My atoms have...
always loved your atoms.

559
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:21,178
              ¶ ¶

560
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:23,446
Let's go.

561
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,322
Karen.

562
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:38,428
                        Hey.
Hi.

563
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,864
                  Hi. This is...
            Sofi, this is Karen.

564
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:42,532
Karen, this is Sofi.
Hi.

565
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,568
She's my wife.

566
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:47,804
         Welcome. Um...

567
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:50,640
    What do you want to see?

568
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:51,808
                   I want to see
                     everything.

569
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,876
Uh...

570
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:55,245
So, I have this gel.

571
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:58,348
And it aligns?

572
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:01,551
The alignment crossed
        PAX6 proteins...

573
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:04,221
         98% identity.

574
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:06,456
Are these the worms?

575
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,461
 They-they can't see anything.

576
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:14,264
Not for long.

577
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:35,252
You know, um...

578
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:37,787
I should... I'm gonna
go take a shower.

579
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,923
You've seen it.

580
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:42,425
   I should... take a shower,
                    IAN: Shower?

581
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,728
brush my teeth...
                  Wait a minute,
                 you're gonna go

582
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,630
right now?
Um... yeah.

583
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:50,600
Yeah, I'm sure you want to show
your wife around the lab and...

584
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,669
      Okay. Are you sure?

585
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,539
       Okay. Well, uh...

586
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:58,541
        this is amazing.

587
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:00,043
The beginning
of something...

588
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:01,745
amazing.

589
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,417
It was nice
to meet you.

590
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:10,020
Amazing stuff, Karen.

591
00:38:10,022 --> 00:38:11,588
              Bye.
                            Bye.

592
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,956
Bye.

593
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:33,476
         What's wrong?

594
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,048
I know something's
wrong, so...

595
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:41,651
     You leave me every day
    to torture little worms?

596
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:49,359
      We're not torturing
         worms... Sofi.

597
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:51,061
     If you're interested,

598
00:38:51,063 --> 00:38:53,430
we're modifying organisms.

599
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:56,333
In this case,
they happen to be worms,

600
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:57,867
that are blind,

601
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,602
    and we're modifying them
        to have vision.

602
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:03,373
 You can make blind worms see?

603
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:04,974
            Kind of.

604
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:07,043
   I mean, we can now, maybe.

605
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:10,547
 You think that's a good idea?

606
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:13,550
 Do you think it's a bad idea?

607
00:39:13,552 --> 00:39:15,485
           I think...

608
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:18,054
  it's dangerous to play God.

609
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:21,124
Sofi, I believe
in proof.

610
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:24,027
       There is no proof

611
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:27,530
         that there is
     some magical spirit...

612
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:30,367
     uh, that's invisible,
        living above us,

613
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:31,768
     right on top of us...

614
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,537
 How many senses do worms have?

615
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,439
They have two:

616
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:37,941
            smell...

617
00:39:37,943 --> 00:39:39,476
           and touch.

618
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:40,643
              Why?

619
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:42,579
             So...

620
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:45,048
       they live without
       any ability to see

621
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,385
or even know about light, right?

622
00:39:48,387 --> 00:39:51,388
      The notion of light
         to them is...

623
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,756
         unimaginable.

624
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:55,792
             Yeah.

625
00:39:55,794 --> 00:39:56,993
                          But...

626
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:59,062
                    we humans...

627
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:01,598
           we know...

628
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,634
      that light exists...

629
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:06,770
        all around them,

630
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:09,806
     right on top of them.

631
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:11,975
                     They cannot
                sense it, but...

632
00:40:11,977 --> 00:40:14,677
with a little mutation, they do.

633
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,045
             Right?

634
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:17,881
            Correct.

635
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,018
             So...

636
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,788
           Dr. Eye...

637
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,790
     perhaps some humans--

638
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:28,491
         rare humans--

639
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:31,995
      have mutated to have
        another sense--

640
00:40:31,997 --> 00:40:34,964
        a spirit sense--

641
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:37,033
        and can perceive a world

642
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:39,502
                   that is right
                 on top of us...

643
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:41,971
                   everywhere...

644
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:45,942
          just... like the light
                 on these worms.

645
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:54,150
      So you're a mutant.

646
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:56,119
                         Mm-hmm.

647
00:40:57,188 --> 00:41:00,156
       And I'm not the only one.

648
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:17,740
Aah! Oh, sh...

649
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:19,609
Jesus!
                   Are you okay?
               Here, let me see.

650
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:22,011
I got formaldehyde in my eye.
Get the splash kit.

651
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:23,746
                     What is it?
Aah! Fuck!

652
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:26,249
            What is it? Tell me!
      It's-it's... yellow!

653
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:27,884
It's right over there.

654
00:41:27,886 --> 00:41:30,687
It's yellow. Call Karen.
Fucking call Karen now.

655
00:41:30,689 --> 00:41:32,889
      Where's the number!
The number's
by the door.

656
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:34,824
By the door.

657
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:37,727
Got it.

658
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:49,038
       We should do this
         every Friday.

659
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,210
        How many fingers
        am I holding up?

660
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:58,081
                             12.
He's not blind.

661
00:41:58,083 --> 00:41:59,616
        So that's good.

662
00:41:59,618 --> 00:42:01,050
 I think you're gonna be fine.

663
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:02,285
Are you okay?

664
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:04,787
                           Yeah.

665
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:08,091
Okay.

666
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:10,527
               Thank you.
    Yeah.

667
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:12,529
  You're gonna feel fine in...

668
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:14,197
     12 hours or something.

669
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,199
       I'll call tomorrow
      and check in on him.

670
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,635
Thank you.
                Yeah, of course.

671
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:38,087
This is funny.

672
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:41,758
Yeah. It's, um...

673
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,327
...strange.

674
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,897
                        Find me.

675
00:42:49,868 --> 00:42:51,234
                           Whoa.

676
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:54,604
Whoa what?

677
00:42:58,643 --> 00:43:00,910
We are in the middle
of two floors.

678
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,645
We stopped.

679
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:05,315
Hmm.

680
00:43:05,317 --> 00:43:06,950
Hmm.

681
00:43:06,952 --> 00:43:08,918
   We should call the super.

682
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,086
The super what?

683
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,155
           The super.
    The superintendent. Um,

684
00:43:12,157 --> 00:43:13,890
the guy that fixes
the building.

685
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:15,592
Can you call him?

686
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:18,795
     I don't know this guy.
    I don't have his number.

687
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:20,797
Of course you don't.

688
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:21,931
Here.

689
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:26,736
             It's under "super."

690
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:28,838
What?

691
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,873
Your phone is dead.

692
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:33,343
                      It's dead?
             Yeah.

693
00:43:33,345 --> 00:43:35,878
Now, come on, relax.

694
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,314
You're so irresponsible.

695
00:43:38,316 --> 00:43:40,917
Okay...

696
00:43:48,026 --> 00:43:50,259
Want me to call Karen?

697
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:56,666
       Don't be a child.

698
00:43:57,868 --> 00:44:00,937
                You live in this
               fairy, magical...

699
00:44:00,939 --> 00:44:03,973
                   fantasy land.

700
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:06,209
      It's a fucking lie,
    and you know it's a lie.

701
00:44:06,211 --> 00:44:07,944
           That's...

702
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:10,947
        it's a lie that you want
       to believe, like a child.

703
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:12,148
                   Like a child.

704
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:33,870
          Okay. Okay.

705
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:35,438
                        Come on.

706
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,907
What's gonna happen?
     I got... I'll boost you up.

707
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:39,842
No, no, no, you go first,
                        Come on.

708
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,277
and you pull me up.
                Sofi, come on...

709
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:43,112
      I'm not going first.
         You go first.

710
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:44,814
                    Look at you.
      You're so scared. Come on.

711
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:50,086
Be careful.

712
00:44:50,088 --> 00:44:51,821
    Look how easy that was.

713
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:53,089
            Come on.

714
00:44:53,091 --> 00:44:55,091
Come on, let's go.

715
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:58,094
        Sofia, come on!

716
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:03,733
              Give me your hand.

717
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:07,770
              Give me your hand.

718
00:45:07,772 --> 00:45:09,105
Oh...

719
00:45:09,107 --> 00:45:10,239
                  Okay, come on.

720
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:45,742
                           Sofi?

721
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:54,150
                     Sofi? Sofi?

722
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:58,054

              No.

             Maybe.

        that I know will
     take your breath away.

00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:50,593
It has an eye.

 light-sensitive cells, but...

You did it.

        That's the first step in

00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:16,839
       and now you expect

 But I do implore them to look

760

    at the evidence and data

       Dr. Ian Gray, uh,
     thanks for being here.

764
00:51:33,858 --> 00:51:35,257
           Thanks for having me.

That thing where you're,
like...

You did nothing with your face.
It was good,

Wow, that's...

00:58:53,063 --> 00:58:55,731
    We've had it in our lab
     for a... for a decade.

863
00:58:55,733 --> 00:58:58,567
      Well, it's still new
     to the general public.

864
00:58:58,569 --> 00:59:01,270
             Now, we are not yet
                legally required

865
00:59:01,272 --> 00:59:04,907
            to scan eyes, but we
          adopted the technology

866
00:59:04,909 --> 00:59:08,277
             and use it with the
               parents' consent.

867
00:59:08,279 --> 00:59:10,712
      I-I'm fine with it.
         Do you, uh...?

868
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:13,949
- Scan, yeah. Do the scan.
- I dim the lights.

869
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:18,220
  The system is non-obtrusive,

870
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:20,055
            and in all actuality

871
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:23,992
                  is just taking
              photo of the eyes.

872
00:59:23,994 --> 00:59:25,961
                   There you go.
Come here, Tobias.

873
00:59:25,963 --> 00:59:27,729
                  Oh, thank you.
You got it?

874
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:30,766
             Y... Yes, I got it.
                      Thank you.

875
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:34,937
           What happens then is,
              the computer finds

876
00:59:34,939 --> 00:59:37,606
        a bunch of points in the
          crevices of the eye...

877
00:59:37,608 --> 00:59:39,041
     Yeah, we-we understand
         how it works.

878
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:50,752
Oh, forgive me.

879
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:54,122
  These systems are sort of new.
                   Can you tell?

880
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:57,025
       Paul Edgar Dairy?

881
00:59:57,027 --> 00:59:59,661
Sounds like a pirate.

882
00:59:59,663 --> 01:00:02,764
                If this happens,
  I'm supposed to punch in a key

883
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:04,866
                     and reboot.

884
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:10,872
Wait.

885
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:20,916
                    There we go.

886
01:00:20,918 --> 01:00:22,918
                    So I'll just
                put in his info.

887
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:26,054
               What is his name?

888
01:00:26,056 --> 01:00:28,790
    I like Paul Edgar Dairy.
           It's fine.

889
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:31,093
     Tobias... George Gray.

890
01:00:31,095 --> 01:00:33,161
     After his grandfather.

891
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:42,671
- Hello?
- Hi. Is this Ian Gray?

892
01:00:42,673 --> 01:00:45,073
             It is.
    My name is Dr. Simmons.

893
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:48,076
I work in conjunction with Yale
   and the Greenwich hospital

894
01:00:48,078 --> 01:00:51,013
    where you and your wife
      gave birth in July.

895
01:00:51,015 --> 01:00:53,849
         Y-Yeah, yeah.
  Is every... everything okay?

896
01:00:53,851 --> 01:00:56,752
    Yes, everything's okay.
    Please don't be alarmed.

897
01:00:56,754 --> 01:00:58,754
       We would, however,
          like to run

898
01:00:58,756 --> 01:01:01,390
       a few simple tests
           on Tobias.

899
01:01:01,392 --> 01:01:05,293
 His test results may suggest,
   although highly unlikely,

900
01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:08,230
     the... the possibility
        of early autism.

901
01:01:08,232 --> 01:01:11,233
     You know I'm a doctor.
       What test results?

902
01:01:11,235 --> 01:01:13,735
   The... We've pinpointed...
             Uh...

903
01:01:13,737 --> 01:01:16,304
        Can you hold on
       a moment, please?

904
01:01:16,306 --> 01:01:19,274
Karen, listen to this.

905
01:01:19,276 --> 01:01:21,109
Yeah.

906
01:01:21,111 --> 01:01:23,311
We've pinpointed
an array of molecular compounds

907
01:01:23,313 --> 01:01:25,013
    that appear in the urine

908
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:27,149
   of children with autism...

909
01:01:27,151 --> 01:01:29,184
      and Tobias showcased

910
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:31,753
         a few of them.
    I promise it's unlikely,

911
01:01:31,755 --> 01:01:35,757
    but worth checking out,
    and we have very simple,

912
01:01:35,759 --> 01:01:38,794
      non-obtrusive tests,
 and we'll be done in an hour.

913
01:01:38,796 --> 01:01:40,996
       What was your name
        and affiliation?

914
01:01:40,998 --> 01:01:42,464
       Dr. Janet Simmons.

915
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:45,000
      I run a research lab
        on child autism

916
01:01:45,002 --> 01:01:47,803
    in conjunction with Yale
  and the Greenwich hospital.

917
01:01:47,805 --> 01:01:50,272
       Simmons, you said?
         Janet Simmons.

918
01:01:50,274 --> 01:01:53,375
   Our clinic is in Stamford,
    not too far from there.

919
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:56,445
         It's important
      to check this soon.

920
01:01:56,447 --> 01:01:57,979
           There's...

921
01:01:57,981 --> 01:02:01,283
    no alarming rush, but...
    we could see him today.

922
01:02:01,285 --> 01:02:02,851
        Okay. Thank you.
      You'll hear from us.

923
01:02:03,954 --> 01:02:06,988
              ¶ ¶

924
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:16,898
Tobias.

925
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:19,401
     Look here. Look here.

926
01:02:36,019 --> 01:02:38,019
I'm not sure I understand

927
01:02:38,021 --> 01:02:39,788
how this is testing for autism.

928
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:42,891
The blood and urine tests will
check for molecular compounds.

929
01:02:42,893 --> 01:02:45,026
This test is
purely perceptual,

930
01:02:45,028 --> 01:02:47,195
tracking the child's
eye movements

931
01:02:47,197 --> 01:02:50,031
and attractions.

932
01:03:56,265 --> 01:03:59,367
              ¶ ¶

933
01:04:20,457 --> 01:04:23,425
Okay, that's enough. I'm...
    Yeah. The test is over.

934
01:04:24,927 --> 01:04:27,095
              ¶ ¶

935
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:35,604
If you are calling regarding

936
01:04:35,606 --> 01:04:37,172
       an existing child,

937
01:04:37,174 --> 01:04:39,608
 please enter your seven-digit
        session number.

938
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:44,379
        This Dr. Simmons
      is up to something.

939
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:46,581
     Child autism, my ass.

940
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:48,350
     I keep running through
          her studies.

941
01:04:48,352 --> 01:04:51,386
      What was she doing?
    Two images side by side.

942
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:53,622
                     Two images,
          similar but different.

943
01:04:53,624 --> 01:04:55,323
       Tobias would look
      at one or the other.

944
01:04:55,325 --> 01:04:57,592
    Do you remember anything
   specific about the images?

945
01:04:57,594 --> 01:05:00,028
      Something connected
         to something?

946
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:02,297
  Something we could look up?

947
01:05:02,299 --> 01:05:05,133
                  There was a...
                      farmhouse.

948
01:05:08,372 --> 01:05:09,938
        There was, um...

949
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:12,140
  Dan's Diner in Boise, Idaho.

950
01:05:12,142 --> 01:05:13,642
            Whatever that means.

951
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:17,579
   Well, that's a real place.

952
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:33,662
              ¶ ¶

953
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:43,305
                          Hello.

954
01:05:43,307 --> 01:05:44,940
      What can I get you?

955
01:05:44,942 --> 01:05:47,409
       Um, just a cup of coffee.

956
01:05:47,411 --> 01:05:49,377
Sure thing.

957
01:05:55,685 --> 01:05:57,385
   I'm not from around here.

958
01:05:57,387 --> 01:05:59,554
      I was wondering, uh,
 is there anything interesting

959
01:05:59,556 --> 01:06:01,256
                 in town to see?

960
01:06:01,258 --> 01:06:02,557
Not much around
these parts.

961
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:04,492
        Unless you, uh,
    fancy visiting some cows

962
01:06:04,494 --> 01:06:06,094
    down at the dairy farm.

963
01:06:06,096 --> 01:06:08,296
     There's a dairy farm?

964
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:09,698
Mm-hmm.
That'll be a dollar.

965
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,066
              Oh.

966
01:06:11,068 --> 01:06:13,335
           Of course.

967
01:06:13,337 --> 01:06:15,170
              Where is the dairy
                   farm located?

968
01:06:15,172 --> 01:06:17,238
        Uh, take a left,
 about two miles down the road.

969
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,707
Can't miss it.

970
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:28,383
              ¶ ¶

971
01:06:32,022 --> 01:06:33,254
     We'll have 'em through
          in a moment.

972
01:06:33,256 --> 01:06:34,689
O-Okay.

973
01:06:34,691 --> 01:06:35,690
            Come on!

974
01:06:39,261 --> 01:06:42,063
    Is this the dairy farm?

975
01:06:42,065 --> 01:06:43,999
Indeed it is.

976
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:47,302
    These are milking cows?

977
01:06:47,304 --> 01:06:48,770
These are meat cows,
not milking cows.

978
01:06:48,772 --> 01:06:50,338
        I'm Julie Dairy.

979
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,539
   This is my family's farm.

980
01:06:51,541 --> 01:06:54,242
          Julie Dairy?

981
01:06:54,244 --> 01:06:56,244
     Uh, Paul Edgar Dairy.

982
01:06:56,246 --> 01:06:57,545
    Are you related to him?

983
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:00,682
      Yes, he's my father.

984
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,553
          Is he here?

985
01:07:05,555 --> 01:07:08,423
       You're clearly not
with the biography association.

986
01:07:08,425 --> 01:07:09,524
             The, um, I'm sorry.

987
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:11,192
        I don't follow.

988
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:13,762
Some documentary crew came
through here a few months ago,

989
01:07:13,764 --> 01:07:16,231
     wanting to do a story
 on the great Paul Edgar Dairy,

990
01:07:16,233 --> 01:07:18,533
the only black farmer in Boise.

991
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:20,502
They took some pictures.

992
01:07:20,504 --> 01:07:23,338
          I liked the story, and
     they said they'd follow up.

993
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:27,042
You okay?

994
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:32,347
      How you doing there?

995
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,184
           I'm okay.

996
01:07:36,186 --> 01:07:38,086
 I'm just, uh, having a moment

997
01:07:38,088 --> 01:07:39,621
                     of déjà vu.

998
01:07:39,623 --> 01:07:41,456
  Can we fetch you some water?

999
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:43,391
        Or a cup of tea?

1000
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:46,828
 I'd really love to meet Paul,
     if that was possible.

1001
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:52,634
What if we just start at
the beginning and break it down?

1002
01:07:52,636 --> 01:07:55,437
        In the hospital,
Tobias's eyes come up as a match

1003
01:07:55,439 --> 01:07:57,372
          with Paul Edgar Dairy,
           which is not correct,

1004
01:07:57,374 --> 01:07:59,307
    because Tobias has blue eyes

1005
01:07:59,309 --> 01:08:00,775
      and Paul Edgar Dairy
        has brown eyes.

1006
01:08:00,777 --> 01:08:04,145
         Uh, no, iris biometrics
          is not based on color.

1007
01:08:04,147 --> 01:08:05,780
                   It's based on
              the unique crypts,

1008
01:08:05,782 --> 01:08:07,749
       furrows and shapes
        in the texture.

1009
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:11,252
    So maybe Tobias and Paul
  have the same iris pattern.

1010
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:12,720
   Statistically impossible.

1011
01:08:12,722 --> 01:08:15,090
Second data point.

1012
01:08:15,092 --> 01:08:17,425
      Tobias and Paul have
    some kind of connection.

1013
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:19,627
              It's not our test,
               so we don't know.

1014
01:08:19,629 --> 01:08:21,729
And the third data point
is that

1015
01:08:21,731 --> 01:08:25,600
     Paul Edgar Dairy dies
     before Tobias is born.

1016
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:27,569
         Was conceived.

1017
01:08:27,571 --> 01:08:31,206
Was conceived,
because Tobias is born

1018
01:08:31,208 --> 01:08:33,374
            in July,
   and Paul Edgar Dairy dies

1019
01:08:33,376 --> 01:08:35,477
  in September 2012; that's...

1020
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:36,544
...that's ten months.
    Okay, what-what are you guys

1021
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:37,879
        talking about right now?

1022
01:08:37,881 --> 01:08:39,481
          This... you guys sound
              like crazy people.

1023
01:08:39,483 --> 01:08:41,649
              Okay? What is this
         connection referencing?

1024
01:08:41,651 --> 01:08:44,252
Doctor...
              Ja... Dr. Simmons.

1025
01:08:44,254 --> 01:08:45,420
From Yale.

1026
01:08:45,422 --> 01:08:47,155
  She did this test on Tobias.

1027
01:08:47,157 --> 01:08:48,490
Dr. Simmons?

1028
01:08:48,492 --> 01:08:49,891
                      From Yale?

1029
01:08:49,893 --> 01:08:52,460
  She's one-one of five people
        who have access

1030
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:54,362
            to the eye database.
What?

1031
01:08:54,364 --> 01:08:57,599
        My company owns a patent
              on iris biometrics

1032
01:08:57,601 --> 01:09:00,435
       and consolidate all their
         data into one database.

1033
01:09:00,437 --> 01:09:03,171
      And Simmons is one of five
        people that have access.

1034
01:09:03,173 --> 01:09:05,173
      But you have access
          to it, too.

1035
01:09:05,175 --> 01:09:06,641
Sort of.

1036
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:08,610
                  I can find the
                iris code, okay?

1037
01:09:08,612 --> 01:09:10,678
         Run it and see
     if it's in the system,

1038
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,580
 and then check the IP address

1039
01:09:12,582 --> 01:09:14,349
      and check-check when
  and where it was registered.

1040
01:09:14,351 --> 01:09:15,517
         I can do that.

1041
01:09:15,519 --> 01:09:17,152
How do you do that?

1042
01:09:17,154 --> 01:09:18,419
Look into that.

1043
01:09:18,421 --> 01:09:19,888
                Okay, other eye.

1044
01:09:21,258 --> 01:09:23,158
                      All right.
Okay.

1045
01:09:24,593 --> 01:09:27,762
        So I can't get your name
               or biographicals,

1046
01:09:27,764 --> 01:09:29,864
              but I can see that
          you are in the system.

1047
01:09:29,866 --> 01:09:32,300
            Amazing.
                          Right?

1048
01:09:32,302 --> 01:09:34,903
                     And that...

1049
01:09:34,905 --> 01:09:36,304
             you were registered

1050
01:09:36,306 --> 01:09:37,705
             at the lab in 2005,

1051
01:09:37,707 --> 01:09:39,807
          and the same should be
           for Karen and myself.

1052
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:44,512
   What are you thinking, Karen?

1053
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:45,847
Well, check this out.

1054
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:48,483
       So Paul and Tobias

1055
01:09:48,485 --> 01:09:50,618
  have the same iris patterns,
        let's just say,

1056
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:52,253
     and there's some sort
         of connection.

1057
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:54,822
So the next logical step
in our scientific inquiry

1058
01:09:54,824 --> 01:09:58,293
is to find someone

1059
01:09:58,295 --> 01:10:01,229
        that we do know
who's a duplicate in the system.

1060
01:10:01,231 --> 01:10:02,897
      Like a family member
         who has died.

1061
01:10:02,899 --> 01:10:04,632
That's it.
          We need another match.

1062
01:10:04,634 --> 01:10:07,268
                   Guys, this is
       statistically impossible.

1063
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:08,336
You're not gonna find anything.

1064
01:10:08,338 --> 01:10:09,504
Can you get a scan

1065
01:10:09,506 --> 01:10:10,772
         from a photo?

1066
01:10:10,774 --> 01:10:12,640
           It has to be high-res
                   and in focus.

1067
01:10:12,642 --> 01:10:13,942
                    Technically,
             I can do it, but...

1068
01:10:13,944 --> 01:10:17,345
        I have hundreds
       of high-res photos

1069
01:10:17,347 --> 01:10:18,746
of people's eyes.
           All right.

1070
01:10:18,748 --> 01:10:19,914
You can scan these.

1071
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:22,483
         Give me the hard drive.

1072
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:24,919
This is ridiculous.

1073
01:10:24,921 --> 01:10:26,487
Who do you want me to run?

1074
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:28,489
             Hmm, run my father.

1075
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:29,924
             Tobias George Gray.

1076
01:10:29,926 --> 01:10:31,893
All right.
          He died two years ago.

1077
01:10:34,797 --> 01:10:37,465
He's in the system, and...

1078
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:39,467
             and he's registered

1079
01:10:39,469 --> 01:10:41,469
- at Heathrow 2006.
- Okay.

1080
01:10:41,471 --> 01:10:42,770
       That makes sense.

1081
01:10:42,772 --> 01:10:45,306
   He-he was traveling there
          frequently.

1082
01:10:45,308 --> 01:10:47,609
    Try, um, my Uncle Basil.

1083
01:10:48,877 --> 01:10:51,246
             He died seven years
                  ago of cancer.

1084
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:54,015
All right.

1085
01:10:54,017 --> 01:10:55,450
Not found.

1086
01:10:55,452 --> 01:10:56,851
     Try your grandparents.
My grandparents.

1087
01:10:56,853 --> 01:10:58,353
                 Yeah.
Bev and Barry.

1088
01:10:58,355 --> 01:11:00,321
Bev...

1089
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:03,658
      She's in the system.

1090
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:05,860
                   Registered...

1091
01:11:05,862 --> 01:11:08,696
at Schiphol Airport,
Amsterdam, in 1998.

1092
01:11:08,698 --> 01:11:10,598
      How many people are
        in the database?

1093
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,500
         There's, like,
     hundreds of millions.

1094
01:11:12,502 --> 01:11:14,269
    There's a billion soon.

1095
01:11:14,271 --> 01:11:15,470
            Try my grandparents.

1096
01:11:15,472 --> 01:11:17,338
        Okay.
                    Right there.

1097
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:18,840
Judy is in the system.

1098
01:11:18,842 --> 01:11:22,043
She was registered
in a nursing home in New Haven

1099
01:11:22,045 --> 01:11:23,845
                        in 2009.
            And Malcolm?

1100
01:11:23,847 --> 01:11:25,713
Malcolm...

1101
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:26,814
Not found.
Not registered.

1102
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:30,285
  All right, so anybody else?

1103
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:34,555
             Sofi.

1104
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:40,361
      Okay, try-try Sofi.

1105
01:11:40,363 --> 01:11:41,596
                           Okay.

1106
01:11:41,598 --> 01:11:43,865
             Sofi.

1107
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:55,777
      She's in the system.

1108
01:11:55,779 --> 01:11:57,011
    Yeah, that makes sense.

1109
01:11:57,013 --> 01:11:58,913
    She was probably scanned

1110
01:11:58,915 --> 01:12:00,515
  when she came through Customs.

1111
01:12:00,517 --> 01:12:03,084
No. It says that...

1112
01:12:03,086 --> 01:12:05,920
   the IP address coordinates
    say that she was scanned

1113
01:12:05,922 --> 01:12:08,056
     in a community center
        in Delhi, India.

1114
01:12:08,058 --> 01:12:10,792
 She must have traveled there.

1115
01:12:10,794 --> 01:12:12,593
       Three months ago?

1116
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:16,964
That doesn't make any sense.

1117
01:12:16,966 --> 01:12:18,066
That's not right.

1118
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:24,339
                  It's an error.

1119
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:28,042
It's only the seventh one
we tried.

1120
01:12:28,044 --> 01:12:30,611
         I need to get some air.

1121
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:33,748
What the fuck
                   is happening?

1122
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:43,424
              ¶ ¶

1123
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,368
              ¶ ¶

1124
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:03,478
              ¶ ¶

1125
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:13,521
              ¶ ¶

1126
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:22,697
    Did you put him to bed?

1127
01:13:22,699 --> 01:13:24,665
             Yeah.

1128
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,108
    You should go to India.

1129
01:13:39,715 --> 01:13:41,182
      I can't go to India.

1130
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,954
        Can't or won't?

1131
01:13:46,956 --> 01:13:50,091
                    India is not
            Boise, Idaho, Karen.

1132
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:52,827
There is someone there
with Sofi's exact iris pattern.

1133
01:13:55,063 --> 01:13:57,565
     The eyes and the brain
         are connected.

1134
01:13:57,567 --> 01:14:00,001
  If-if the cellular structure
           in the eye

1135
01:14:00,003 --> 01:14:01,936
is reoccurring
from person to person,

1136
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:04,005
then maybe something
in the brain

1137
01:14:04,007 --> 01:14:05,540
     carries over as well,

1138
01:14:05,542 --> 01:14:08,142
  like a neurological link...

1139
01:14:08,144 --> 01:14:11,746
    Maybe the eye really is
        some kind of...

1140
01:14:11,748 --> 01:14:14,515
      window to the soul.

1141
01:14:14,517 --> 01:14:16,184
       Soul, Karen? Soul?

1142
01:14:16,186 --> 01:14:19,620
    Is my wife really using
        the word "soul"?

1143
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:22,023
Like you hold
any validity in that?

1144
01:14:22,025 --> 01:14:23,758
   Call it whatever you want
          to call it.

1145
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,626
    Dr. Simmons was testing
      a memory connection

1146
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:29,163
        between our son
     and Paul Edgar Dairy.

1147
01:14:29,165 --> 01:14:32,133
    And it wasn't our test,
    but you can go to India,

1148
01:14:32,135 --> 01:14:34,502
  and you can find this person
       with Sofi's eyes,

1149
01:14:34,504 --> 01:14:35,703
    and you can do the same.

1150
01:14:35,705 --> 01:14:37,038
               I can't go there.

1151
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,739
It's just India.
Why can't you make...

1152
01:14:38,741 --> 01:14:40,141
    Not India. I can't go there!

1153
01:14:40,143 --> 01:14:41,609
     I can't go back there!

1154
01:14:41,611 --> 01:14:43,478
        I can't go back
    to that part of my life!

1155
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:44,712
         I can't do it!

1156
01:14:57,826 --> 01:15:00,761
    I gotta just let it go.

1157

      The man I married...

1159
01:15:19,082 --> 01:15:21,749
   I don't think he would let
         his own grief,

1160
01:15:21,751 --> 01:15:24,085
  even if it was overwhelming,

1161
01:15:24,087 --> 01:15:26,187
         get in the way
  of what could potentially be

1162
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:28,222
          the greatest
      scientific discovery

1163
01:15:28,224 --> 01:15:30,057
    the world has ever seen.

1164
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:34,962
    This is bigger than you.

1165
01:15:34,964 --> 01:15:36,931
      It's bigger than me.

1166
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:39,934
     It's bigger than Sofi.

1167
01:15:39,936 --> 01:15:42,169
 Then-then maybe you should go.

1168
01:15:42,171 --> 01:15:44,272
I would...

1169
01:15:44,274 --> 01:15:48,175
   but I-I didn't know Sofi.

1170
01:15:48,177 --> 01:15:49,977
     It's a false positive,
        you understand?

1171
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:51,846
         It's an error;
     it has to be an error.

1172
01:15:51,848 --> 01:15:54,749
It's st... it's a statistically
     impossible data point.

1173
01:15:57,619 --> 01:16:00,254
      If I drop this phone
       a thousand times,

1174
01:16:00,256 --> 01:16:02,123
        a million times,

1175
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:04,559
 and one time it doesn't fall,

1176
01:16:04,561 --> 01:16:06,861
           just once,

1177
01:16:06,863 --> 01:16:08,963
          it hovers...

1178
01:16:08,965 --> 01:16:10,798
         in the air...

1179
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:15,303
      ...that is an error
    that's worth looking at.

1180
01:16:15,305 --> 01:16:18,272
  You're so fucking stubborn.

      Uh, can I help you?

1224
01:19:18,221 --> 01:19:20,087
You seem like the boss
of this place.

1225
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:22,156
       Boss? No, circus manager,

I'm Dr. Ian Gray.

1229
01:19:26,028 --> 01:19:27,795
I'm visiting from America.

1230
01:19:27,797 --> 01:19:31,232
I have a very strange request.

1231
01:19:31,234 --> 01:19:32,967
                            Yes?

1232
01:19:32,969 --> 01:19:35,069
    I'm looking for someone

1233
01:19:35,071 --> 01:19:37,037
      who was scanned here
         a while back.

1234
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:39,473
The thing is,
I-I don't have their name.

1235
01:19:39,475 --> 01:19:42,243
All I have is a picture
of their eyes.

1236
01:19:46,414 --> 01:19:48,516
              This is what their
                 eyes look like.

1237
01:19:48,518 --> 01:19:50,851
                 They may not be
               this exact color.

1238
01:19:50,853 --> 01:19:52,453
             Uh...

1239
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:55,489
  Why are you looking for her?

1240
01:19:55,491 --> 01:19:57,057
Is she in some kind of trouble?

1241
01:19:57,059 --> 01:19:58,859
              Her?

1242
01:19:58,861 --> 01:20:00,494
     Uh, no, of course not.

1243
01:20:00,496 --> 01:20:01,929
     She's not in trouble.

1244
01:20:01,931 --> 01:20:03,998
She's-she's incredibly special.

1245
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,267
   So you do recognize them?

1246
01:20:06,269 --> 01:20:08,569
         I do, if it is
       who I think it is,

1247
01:20:08,571 --> 01:20:10,504
but why are you looking for her?

1248
01:20:10,506 --> 01:20:12,473
Here's another photo.

1249
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:16,443
           Okay, um,
    this doesn't make sense.

1250
01:20:16,445 --> 01:20:17,845
These are her eyes,

1251
01:20:17,847 --> 01:20:20,147
but this isn't her face
around them.

1252
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:23,484
       That's exactly why
      I'm looking for her.

1253
01:20:27,055 --> 01:20:28,255
           Salomina.

1254
01:20:28,257 --> 01:20:29,423
Salomina?
             Yeah.

1255
01:20:29,425 --> 01:20:32,860
                 Sweet girl, uh,
                very smart girl.

1256
01:20:32,862 --> 01:20:35,996
            But, uh,
  I haven't seen her recently.

1257
01:20:35,998 --> 01:20:38,532
When was the last time
you saw her?

1258
01:20:38,534 --> 01:20:41,101
     Uh, a few months ago.

1259
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:45,206
  Could you help me find her?

1260
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:46,907
             Um...

1261
01:20:46,909 --> 01:20:49,543
I could make a donation
to the community center.

1262
01:20:49,545 --> 01:20:52,112
     I mean, I'm-I'm going
       to make a donation

1263
01:20:52,114 --> 01:20:53,948
    to the community center.

1264
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:56,517
  I don't want to sound crass,
     like I'm bribing you,

1265
01:20:56,519 --> 01:20:58,385
 but I am kind of bribing you.

1266
01:20:58,387 --> 01:21:00,087
     No, no, no, of course.

1267
01:21:00,089 --> 01:21:02,890
I mean, of course, any donation
     would help the center.

1268
01:21:02,892 --> 01:21:05,092
             Uh...

1269
01:21:05,094 --> 01:21:06,927
It's very important.

1270
01:21:06,929 --> 01:21:08,896
            Please.

1271
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:11,532
             Okay.

1272
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:14,635
   You meet me tomorrow at 12:00

01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:48,535
You want me to take
a photo of you?

1277
01:21:50,473 --> 01:21:52,306
        You want to see?

01:22:03,618 --> 01:22:05,519
     I almost didn't come.

1281
01:22:05,521 --> 01:22:07,354
Yeah, I was worried.

1282
01:22:07,356 --> 01:22:09,423
What changed your mind?

1283
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:10,958
            I, um...

1284
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,593
  I did some research on you.

1285
01:22:12,595 --> 01:22:14,662
Uh-oh.

1286
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:16,597
             Come.

1287
01:22:22,939 --> 01:22:25,439
Hello.

1288
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:27,107
Do all these children...

1289
01:22:27,109 --> 01:22:29,643
do they eventually end up
at the community center or...

1290
01:22:29,645 --> 01:22:31,979
                        Some do,

1291
01:22:31,981 --> 01:22:34,081
              but there are over
              one million people

1292
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:37,084
                  living in this
          30-block radius alone.

1293
01:22:37,086 --> 01:22:38,986
  According to the registrar,

1294
01:22:38,988 --> 01:22:41,288
    Salomina and her parents
           live here.

1295
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:43,958
     Somebody's here-- I'm gonna
             ask this lady here.

1296
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:45,726
             Okay.

1297
01:22:50,366 --> 01:22:51,699
          ...Salomina.
Ah, Salomina...

1298
01:23:10,518 --> 01:23:12,152
                   What's wrong?

1299
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:13,554
                 What'd she say?

1300
01:23:19,094 --> 01:23:22,396
<i> She could be living</i>
       <i> like a stray dog.</i>

1301
01:23:22,398 --> 01:23:24,064
      She's totally alone.

1302
01:23:24,066 --> 01:23:26,433
       Her mother's dead;
       her father's dead.

1303
01:23:26,435 --> 01:23:29,570
She knows the address
    of the community center,

1304
01:23:29,572 --> 01:23:32,740
   but Priya said she hasn't
      been there in weeks.

1305
01:23:32,742 --> 01:23:35,642
There's a million people living
     in a ten-block radius.

1306
01:23:35,644 --> 01:23:38,312
    It's gonna be impossible
          to find her.

1307
01:23:41,316 --> 01:23:43,550
  Well, you shouldn't give up.

1308
01:23:43,552 --> 01:23:45,185
        You flew halfway
       around the world.

1309
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:46,453
    You should keep looking.

1310
01:23:46,455 --> 01:23:49,723
  At least give it a few days.

1311
01:23:49,725 --> 01:23:51,759
      I'm gonna go to bed.

1312
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:54,728
                     Good night.

1313
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:56,497
              Bye.

1314
01:24:03,739 --> 01:24:05,706
What am I doing here?

1315
01:24:13,314 --> 01:24:15,282

1317
01:24:33,768 --> 01:24:36,470
You're mad.

1318
01:24:36,472 --> 01:24:38,705
            It's a smoke signal.

1319
01:24:38,707 --> 01:24:41,708
Someone she knows will see it.

1320
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:45,079
             I'm glad you didn't
         put my number up there.

1321
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:53,520
Hello?

1322
01:24:53,522 --> 01:24:54,655
Hello?

1323
01:24:54,657 --> 01:24:56,723
Hi, yes?

1324
01:24:56,725 --> 01:24:59,159
  Yeah, my niece has eyes like
the picture board, cash reward.

1325
01:24:59,161 --> 01:25:01,128
Are they just like the ones
in the picture?

1326
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:03,130
        Yes, I think so.

1327
01:25:03,132 --> 01:25:04,298
         Like, exactly?

1328
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:05,399
       Uh, very much so.

1329
01:25:05,401 --> 01:25:06,633
     How old is your niece?

1330
01:25:06,635 --> 01:25:07,801
           Eighteen.

1331
01:25:07,803 --> 01:25:09,770
     My other niece is 15.

1332
01:25:09,772 --> 01:25:12,873
       Oh, no, um, sorry.

1333
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:14,274
                  Thank you, no.

1334
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:15,642
            Sorry, wrong person.

1335
01:25:15,644 --> 01:25:17,111
                            Bye.

1336
01:25:24,153 --> 01:25:25,619
            <i> Hello?</i>

1337
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:30,491
Do you speak English?

1338
01:25:30,493 --> 01:25:31,792
Yes, I do.

1339
01:25:31,794 --> 01:25:34,495
I'm sorry,
what-what were you saying?

1340
01:25:34,497 --> 01:25:37,431
  I have the eyes you took up
     the advertisement for.

1341
01:25:37,433 --> 01:25:38,732
How old are you?

1342
01:25:38,734 --> 01:25:40,234
          Twenty-four.

1343
01:25:40,236 --> 01:25:41,835
No, sorry.

1344
01:25:41,837 --> 01:25:43,871
The person I'm looking for
is much younger.

1345
01:25:43,873 --> 01:25:45,372
   No, thank you for calling.

1346
01:25:45,374 --> 01:25:46,507
             Sorry.

1347
01:26:00,222 --> 01:26:01,722
Very good!

1348
01:26:01,724 --> 01:26:03,590
I'm the best!
              I'm the very best?

1349
01:26:03,592 --> 01:26:05,225
I'm the very best.

1350
01:26:05,227 --> 01:26:06,727
Very good.

1351
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:20,440
Dr. Gray, are you...
              are you religious?

1352
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:24,878
        Am I religious?

1353
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,947
  I thought you researched me.

1354
01:26:26,949 --> 01:26:28,649
I'm not religious.

1355
01:26:28,651 --> 01:26:30,584
            Why not?

1356
01:26:32,587 --> 01:26:35,756
Religion is based
on scripture written by men

1357
01:26:35,758 --> 01:26:37,457
thousands of years ago.

1358
01:26:37,459 --> 01:26:40,727
Those beliefs can't be
changed or challenged.

1359
01:26:40,729 --> 01:26:41,929
They're fixed.

1360
01:26:41,931 --> 01:26:43,363
In science,

1361
01:26:43,365 --> 01:26:45,732
         great thinkers
      have written things

1362
01:26:45,734 --> 01:26:47,401
         very long ago,

1363
01:26:47,403 --> 01:26:50,771
      but every generation
      improves upon them.

1364
01:26:50,773 --> 01:26:52,806
    The words are not holy.

1365
01:26:52,808 --> 01:26:55,742
  Einstein is a brilliant man,
     but he's not our god.

1366
01:26:57,478 --> 01:27:01,281
 He's one step in the evolution
         of knowledge,

1367
01:27:01,283 --> 01:27:03,584
     but we always continue
        to step forward.

1368
01:27:03,586 --> 01:27:04,818
                     You know...

1369
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:07,487
     a scientist once asked
        the Dalai Lama,

1370
01:27:07,489 --> 01:27:10,524
       "What would you do
    if something scientific

1371
01:27:10,526 --> 01:27:13,427
         disproved your
      religious beliefs?"

1372
01:27:13,429 --> 01:27:15,629
                    And he said,
             after much thought,

1373
01:27:15,631 --> 01:27:17,698
                   "I would look
              at all the papers.

1374
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:19,533
                "I'd take a look
             at all the research

1375
01:27:19,535 --> 01:27:22,803
              "and really try to
              understand things.

1376
01:27:22,805 --> 01:27:24,638
"And in the end, if it was clear

1377
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:28,675
 "that the scientific evidence
disproved my spiritual beliefs,

1378
01:27:28,677 --> 01:27:32,446
  I would change my beliefs."

1379
01:27:32,448 --> 01:27:34,414
     That's a good answer.

1380
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:39,786
             Ian...

1381
01:27:41,422 --> 01:27:44,625
            ...what would you do
          if something spiritual

1382
01:27:44,627 --> 01:27:47,928
           disproved
    your scientific beliefs?

1383
01:28:16,357 --> 01:28:18,025
Hello, love.

1384
01:28:18,027 --> 01:28:20,327
     The bank called today.

1385
01:28:20,329 --> 01:28:22,296
  They said that $2,000 a day

1386
01:28:22,298 --> 01:28:23,997
    is going to some sketchy
     Planet India company.

1387
01:28:23,999 --> 01:28:25,465
    It's, like, 20k already.

1388
01:28:25,467 --> 01:28:27,534
        What's going on?

1389
01:28:27,536 --> 01:28:28,969
     I put up a billboard.

1390
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:30,704
       I-I know it sounds
         a bit extreme,

1391
01:28:30,706 --> 01:28:32,039
 but it's all I could think of.

1392
01:28:32,041 --> 01:28:34,941
     Ian, it's been weeks.

1393
01:28:34,943 --> 01:28:37,477
 I think you should come back.

1394
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,682
   Karen, what-what happened

1395
01:28:41,684 --> 01:28:44,484
     to turning over rocks
and finding nothing is progress?

1396
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:46,620
         I'm down with
  the big picture of all this.

1397
01:28:46,622 --> 01:28:48,955
          I'm the one
     who wanted you to go.

1398
01:28:48,957 --> 01:28:51,892
     But failed experiments
 are not unknown to us, right?

1399
01:28:51,894 --> 01:28:53,360
          We regroup.

1400
01:28:53,362 --> 01:28:54,828
   We look for more matches.

1401
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:57,364
         We try again.

1402
01:28:57,366 --> 01:28:59,499
       Please come home.
