1
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,062
Every living person on this planet
has their own unique pair of eyes.

2
00:01:02,272 --> 00:01:04,524
Each their own universe.

3
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:20,873
My name is Dr. Ian Gray.

4
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:23,751
I'm a father, a husband...

5
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:26,462
and I'm a scientist.

6
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:36,764
When I was a child,
I realized that...

7
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:40,435
the camera was designed
exactly like the human eye...

8
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:44,772
taking in light through a
lens, forming it into images.

9
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:50,111
I began taking as many pictures
of eyes as I possibly could.

10
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:14,052
I'd like to tell you the story of
the eyes that changed my world.

11
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:17,013
Remember these eyes.

12
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:20,183
Remember all the details
in these eyes.

13
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:24,437
Okay!

14
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:37,367
It started when I was a 26-year-old Ph.D.
student living in New York.

15
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:40,411
It was Halloween,
eight years ago.

16
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,367
You Okay?

17
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:25,206
I'm watching the moon.

18
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,926
Can I take a picture
of your eyes?

19
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:39,679
Why?

20
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:43,266
It's just something I do.

21
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:48,896
Okay.

22
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:51,941
Yeah? I've perfected this.

23
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:19,135
Hi.

24
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:20,887
Hi.

25
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:25,433
Do you know the story
of the Phasianidae?

26
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:28,478
The... No, what's that?

27
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:30,062
It's a bird...

28
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:33,900
that experiences all
of time in one instant.

29
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:37,779
And she sings the song
of love and anger...

30
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:41,365
and fear and joy
and sadness all at once.

31
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:45,661
All combined into
one magnificent sound.

32
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:47,246
Where are you from?

33
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,791
Another planet.

34
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,212
What's the bird sound like?

35
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:58,049
It sounds like this.
Lean closer.

36
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:04,889
It's more like noise.

37
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:06,265
Yeah.

38
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:13,356
And this bird...

39
00:05:14,232 --> 00:05:17,443
when she meets
the love of her life...

40
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,488
is both happy and sad.

41
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:24,867
Happy because she sees that
for him is the beginning...

42
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:28,871
and sad because she
knows it is already over.

43
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:44,804
Hey, hey, do you
wanna get a drink?

44
00:05:44,971 --> 00:05:46,472
I don't drink.

45
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:50,893
Like, anything?

46
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:39,525
You're not gonna regret
this in the morning, right?

47
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:58,419
Hold your memory for a moment.

48
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:02,465
With a blind hand.

49
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:06,427
Write some stories.

50
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:10,056
For tomorrow.

51
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:43,839
Your identity confirmed.

52
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:53,432
I finished that transcription
factor program.

53
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:58,729
Last night?

54
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:02,108
No, this morning.

55
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,735
Because, bitch, I don't play.

56
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:08,197
Got the input genes and then you
put your transcription factor...

57
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:10,825
Wait a minute.
You stink of vodka.

58
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:12,472
I mean, like, bad.
Like it smells bad.

59
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,787
Yeah, I know.
I know I reek of vodka.

60
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,330
Stop talking so loud.

61
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:19,750
Okay, I consolidated all of
your data into one database.

62
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:21,377
You are welcome.

63
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:23,379
You're amazing. I hate you.

64
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:26,340
Oh, I love you,
that's why I do it.

65
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,176
Oh, hey, you got
a new rotating student.

66
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:30,511
First year.

67
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,596
- Oh, shi...
- Yeah.

68
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:33,848
Yeah, yeah.

69
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:35,850
Have fun babysitting, buddy.

70
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:37,518
You need gum.

71
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:40,187
You need...
to have fun babysitting.

72
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:42,356
Karen.

73
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,108
Hi, Ian.

74
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:45,443
Can I...

75
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:55,870
Follow me.

76
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,625
You're attempting to
make colorblind mice see color?

77
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,085
That's the idea.

78
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:08,174
But after failed
experiment 352, we'll see.

79
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:09,300
Why?

80
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:11,552
Why what?

81
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,304
Do so many experiments fail?

82
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:17,016
Why are you interested in making
colorblind mice see color?

83
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:18,476
Oh.

84
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,352
Why not?

85
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:24,732
How are you testing
that they see color?

86
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,901
As the new rotating
lab assistant...

87
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:30,362
your job will be
to do very boring,

88
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:31,989
very repetitive experiments...

89
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:34,575
be a glorified note-taker...

90
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:36,744
and not ask me "why"
every five minutes.

91
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:38,662
Okay? Cool.

92
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:43,459
Commencing experiment 353...

93
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:46,504
response to photo pigment
protein in Mus musculus.

94
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:49,215
The control subjects B Beta...

95
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:53,594
G Gamma, E Euphoria...

96
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:56,806
Psychopannychia.

97
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:58,516
I don't know what that means.

98
00:09:58,641 --> 00:09:59,683
Look it up.

99
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:00,807
G as in Goodness gracious.

100
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:03,312
H as in Help me, please.

101
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:04,980
Z as in Zoolander.

102
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:09,610
Are the mice muted with
the photo pigment protein?

103
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,154
When we animate the lines...

104
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:16,826
colorblind mice stare straight.

105
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,328
Whereas...

106
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:21,122
fingers crossed...

107
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,792
the muted mice sh...

108
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,421
Track the lines with their eyes.

109
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:31,924
Holy shit. Holy fucking shit.

110
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,636
Is this on the background
of PAX6 overexpression?

111
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:39,390
You're a first year?

112
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:42,560
I know, it's surprising I can
put together a sentence.

113
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:47,022
Sorry, I asked my last three lab
assistants not to come in...

114
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:49,024
and I'd sign their credits.

115
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:55,322
Anyway, this is just one step
in a very, very long process.

116
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,159
This is a rough estimation...

117
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:02,246
but let's just say that the human
eye has 12 working parts, right?

118
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:04,331
Simplest eye having one.

119
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:07,376
So, if we can fill in the gaps,
the evolutionary gaps...

120
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,754
using single mutations...

121
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:14,216
we can map out the most
logical progression...

122
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,260
of the most basic eye...

123
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:19,638
to the most complex,
fully formed human eye.

124
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:22,850
I don't understand,
why take the time?

125
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:25,019
We know that it evolved.

126
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,521
It's an assumption,
it's not a fact.

127
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:31,066
When you're
no longer a first year,

128
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,027
you'll see how
important facts are.

129
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:34,528
Right.

130
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,492
Each of these animals has an eye

131
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:42,995
that's best selected
for its environment.

132
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,832
It would be cleaner...

133
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:50,377
less variables,
if you had an origin.

134
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,297
Go on.

135
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:55,216
You start with one...

136
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:59,136
to get to 12.
But what if you had zero?

137
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:04,141
A non-seeing organism and built
genetically an eye from scratch...

138
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:06,060
a zero to 12.

139
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:09,063
It'd be a perfect proof,
unassailable.

140
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,900
Non-seeing organisms
don't have the PAX6 gene.

141
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:16,111
How do you know? Has anyone
ever checked all of them?

142
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,325
I don't think anyone has ever checked...
all of them.

143
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:24,828
You've thought of this before?

144
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:27,414
Why did you look surprised?

145
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,166
Because so have you.

146
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:34,588
Okay.

147
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,973
Who were those girls?

148
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:46,058
Which girls?

149
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:49,436
The ones at the Halloween
party in the S&M outfits.

150
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:51,897
S&M outfits?

151
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:53,607
I met one of them.
Don't know her name.

152
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,417
I don't know her face,
but she had these

153
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:58,237
most amazing eyes. So specific.

154
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:01,365
Central heterochromia.

155
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,535
Oh, reminds me.
Guess what I did?

156
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:05,703
What?

157
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:09,164
I figured out an improved
implementation technique...

158
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,917
for Daugman's biometrics algo.

159
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:14,753
You ever feel like
when you met someone,

160
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:17,256
they fill this hole
inside of you...

161
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:18,543
and that when they're gone

162
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,343
you feel that space
painfully vacant?

163
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:24,305
Are you okay, man?

164
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,435
Yeah, yeah.
I'm okay, are you okay?

165
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,895
What did you just say? Did you say...

166
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,647
The way you talked was,
like, poetic.

167
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,733
It was weird. Shut the fuck up.

168
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,818
It was so weird, dude. I can't believe...

169
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,653
Oh, shit.

170
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:44,408
This guy is painfully vacant.

171
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:47,244
Ian, look at him.
He's so painfully vac...

172
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:49,913
He's so painfully vacant.

173
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,041
Fuck off.

174
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:03,177
Can I get a pack of
Verdict and a Powerball?

175
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,139
How much is that?

176
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:11,935
$11.11.

177
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,896
Oh.

178
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:22,696
Lucky elevens.

179
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:26,992
Thanks.

180
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,115
Karen. Mmm-hmm?

181
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:13,700
What are you doing?

182
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,620
Five percent of all animals
don't have vision...

183
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:19,081
and there are 8.7
million species...

184
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:23,460
So I blasted PAX6 at the
database, but nothing came up.

185
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:25,462
So I started
sequencing by myself.

186
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:27,631
How many did you sequence?

187
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:29,883
Twelve.

188
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:31,885
You've done 12.

189
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,179
So, how many do you have left?

190
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:38,725
Like, approximately 426,000.

191
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:45,148
Are you going to write
426,000 names on the window?

192
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:50,529
I'm going to find it before I
get to the end of the window.

193
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,155
Okay.

194
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,116
What are you doing?

195
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:57,578
I'm not doing anything.

196
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:51,048
You know we could be looking
forever and find nothing.

197
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:55,010
Turning over rocks and
finding nothing is progress.

198
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:35,360
Burning papers into ashes.

199
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:38,864
What a season.

200
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:42,492
How they fly high.

201
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:46,621
From the ground, oh.

202
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:53,336
There is yet another fountain.

203
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:56,798
Flowing over.

204
00:20:57,424 --> 00:21:00,469
As the night falls.

205
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:04,556
Keep dreaming.

206
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:08,226
(A W3)'

207
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:19,154
<i>If you hold onto that past.</i>

208
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:25,869
Don't you lock yourself inside.

209
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:32,167
Nothing has been done before.

210
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:35,212
So, are you gonna
tell me where you're from?

211
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:39,216
So many places, I don't know.

212
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:40,926
Which places?

213
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,054
Mmm...

214
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:48,683
To make it short,
I was born in Argentina...

215
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:53,021
and when I was 11, I moved
to France with my grandmother.

216
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,069
And your parents?

217
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,239
Next.

218
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:09,538
So, what do you do?

219
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:10,747
Next.

220
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,339
Why did you sleep
with me that night?

221
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,425
Poor judgment.

222
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:29,266
I was lonely for
a long time and...

223
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,688
when I saw you that night I...

224
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,566
I had the feeling
that I had known you.

225
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:41,069
Actually, I felt
like you knew me.

226
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:44,072
What do you mean?

227
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:48,535
Like we are connected
from past lives.

228
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:51,955
I don't believe in that.

229
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,959
What do you believe in?

230
00:22:57,294 --> 00:22:59,296
I'm a scientist.
I believe in data.

231
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:00,964
A scientist? Mmm-hmm.

232
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:02,299
What kind of scientist?

233
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:03,884
Molecular biology.

234
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,969
I'm most fascinated
with the eye.

235
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:08,555
The eye, the eyes? The eyes.

236
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:09,723
Why the eye?

237
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:12,559
The eye is the one sticking
point that religious people use

238
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:14,769
to discredit evolution.

239
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:18,231
They use it as proof of
an intelligent designer.

240
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:21,776
- Intelligent designer?
- God.

241
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:25,655
I'm looking to end the debate
once and for all with...

242
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:30,160
clear, clean facts.

243
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:33,496
Data points of every
stage of eye-evolution.

244
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:36,625
Why are you working
so hard to disprove God?

245
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:39,920
Disprove? Who proved that God
was there in the first place?

246
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:47,636
Anyway, let's get some real
data points on you, okay?

247
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:49,137
Be my guest.

248
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:51,348
I prefer talking about myself anyway.

249
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,183
Okay.

250
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,060
Um...

251
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,103
What's your favorite...

252
00:23:57,187 --> 00:23:59,648
<i>Candy? Strawberry Mentos.</i>

253
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:00,857
Food?

254
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:05,153
Veggie burritos. I'm
vegetarian, you should know that.

255
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:08,490
What's your favorite flower?

256
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:11,159
Dandelions.

257
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:12,827
Okay. Why?

258
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:18,124
'Cause they're free,
wild, and you can't buy them.

259
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:21,127
What's your favorite
field of study?

260
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:22,796
<i>The stars.</i>

261
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:24,631
What's your favorite animal?

262
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:28,301
The white peacock.
You ever see one?

263
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:29,594
Mmm.

264
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:32,806
There's one in New York. I'll
take you to see it.

265
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,225
So, you're gonna see me again?

266
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:37,811
Maybe.

267
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:51,408
You know, in Indian mythology...

268
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:54,536
the white peacock
symbolizes souls

269
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:56,788
being dispersed
throughout the world.

270
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,666
Did you ever think
it just symbolizes

271
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:02,335
a lack of melanin
or pigment in the cells?

272
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:07,465
The control subjects T...

273
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:08,925
T as in Tsunami.

274
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:11,553
- G as in...
- Gnome.

275
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:14,014
P as in... Pneumonia.

276
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:17,434
M as in... Mnemonic.

277
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:46,880
I start to see these elevens, like,
everywhere. Too many elevens.

278
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,090
The amount was so staggering,

279
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:52,302
so unlikely,
that I followed them.

280
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:54,262
And when I followed them,

281
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:57,265
I found your eyes,
which then led me to you.

282
00:25:58,058 --> 00:26:00,310
Because I found you
through your eyes.

283
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:04,814
So unlikely, like life itself.

284
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:06,649
I know.

285
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,737
I sent them to you.

286
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,114
Bullshit.

287
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:18,495
You know you have it.

288
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:20,997
Have what?
But you're scared of it.

289
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,667
I have what?

290
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:35,178
Okay.

291
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:42,018
You live in this room, right?
Mmm-hmm.

292
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:43,520
Reality.

293
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:48,191
You have a bed,
you have books, um...

294
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:51,444
a desk, a chair, lamps.

295
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:52,612
Logic.

296
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:57,700
But in this room,
you have a door...

297
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,203
to the other side.

298
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:04,040
See?

299
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,960
Light comes through.

300
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:09,129
It's open.

301
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:13,716
Just a tiny bit, but it is open.

302
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:18,888
You keep trying to close that
door because you're scared.

303
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:22,308
But you won't always be scared.

304
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:28,439
What's behind the door?

305
00:27:28,523 --> 00:27:30,066
Besides my dirty laundry.

306
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,527
You have to go in to find out.

307
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:36,573
You know what I'm talking about.

308
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:41,411
I have no idea.

309
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:43,496
You Will.

310
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,040
You Will.

311
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:47,250
Mmm!

312
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:51,838
You want to move to my place?

313
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:54,048
You have a place? Mmm-hmm.

314
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:55,592
Of course.

315
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:58,720
Can I move in tomorrow?

316
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:34,964
Is this your family?

317
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:36,966
Yes, it's my grandmother.

318
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:41,221
Such an eccentric beauty.

319
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:42,639
And...

320
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:49,979
My parents and me
when I was baby.

321
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,819
Um, the white peacock, but you
have met him before. Mmm.

322
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:02,325
This is a proof
of the spirit world.

323
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:04,619
El Angel de la Resurreccién.

324
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:05,787
What?

325
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:07,413
It's the name of the statue.

326
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:09,832
Of the statue in
Saint Anne's Cemetery.

327
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:12,460
It's in Saint Anne's Cemetery?
Mmm-hmm.

328
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:15,171
But look at the eyes.

329
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:17,799
They're alive.

330
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:21,803
It's amazing what you can
do on Photoshop these days.

331
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,930
There's no Photoshop!

332
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:28,518
The eyes appeared just
when she took the picture.

333
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:30,186
Just“.

334
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:32,021
You're so beautiful.

335
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:34,274
Let's get more boxes.

336
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:45,868
Nineteen days gestation period.
She is ready.

337
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:49,998
Fame, science grants...

338
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:52,625
fortune await you.

339
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:56,671
If you find that PAX6 gene,

340
00:29:56,754 --> 00:29:58,798
we'll be well on our way
to all of that.

341
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:03,177
Recognition makes me
extremely nauseous.

342
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:07,890
Well, it is important that
people know about the work.

343
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:11,978
To me, the best thing about
living like a lab rat...

344
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:14,731
is that sometimes...

345
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:18,192
really rare times...

346
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:21,195
you actually discover something.

347
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:26,409
On the night of a discovery
when you're lying in bed...

348
00:30:27,368 --> 00:30:30,580
you are the only person in
the world that knows it's true.

349
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:45,553
Can you promise me something?

350
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:48,056
Promise you something?

351
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,682
Mmm-hmm. What?

352
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:52,852
Promise. I can't promise
if you don't tell me...

353
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:54,771
Promise first.

354
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:57,273
Before you tell me what it is?
Mmm-hmm.

355
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,234
I keep my promises.

356
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:02,570
Whatever, I won't tell.

357
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:04,030
Promise.

358
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:08,618
Okay, I promise.

359
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:10,953
I want you to burn me.

360
00:31:11,746 --> 00:31:14,624
Burn you? I don't want to
rot in a box when I die.

361
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:17,543
Oh, you mean like cremate you.
Mmm...

362
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,922
Yeah. Oh, no. I don't
want to be cremated.

363
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:23,674
Mmm.

364
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:27,136
This is a big disagreement
I didn't know we had.

365
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:29,806
Cremation is like obliteration.

366
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:32,475
I mean, what if in the
future, the scientists...

367
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:36,813
What if they can reconstitute
ourselves through our DNA?

368
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:39,649
I want to be clear with you.
Mmm.

369
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:41,275
I don't want that.

370
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:42,652
You don't want what?

371
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:45,321
I don't want to be cloning.
Cloneed.

372
00:31:45,488 --> 00:31:47,657
"L don't want to be cloning."

373
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:49,242
Cloneed!

374
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:53,246
No, but I'd reconstitute
myself first...

375
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:54,414
then I'd reconstitute you

376
00:31:54,497 --> 00:31:57,250
and then I'd ask you,
"Do you wanna be alive?"

377
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:00,420
And then if you didn't,
I'd kill you.

378
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:08,302
No, but then we could
be together forever,

379
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:11,264
like, for real, scientifically.

380
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:13,850
Reanimated, reconstituted.

381
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:18,020
You have a hard time letting go.

382
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:20,606
Don't worry.

383
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:23,109
We'll find each other again.

384
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:34,954
I love your smell.

385
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:37,623
What is it?

386
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,041
I won't tell.

387
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:41,169
Come on, tell me. Mmm-mmm.

388
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:47,675
Will you marry me?

389
00:32:58,728 --> 00:33:00,021
Next?

390
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:01,898
Can I help you?

391
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:03,232
We'd like to get married.

392
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:04,400
Do you have your lD's?

393
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:05,902
Yeah. Yes.

394
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,960
First you have to get
your marriage license,

395
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:14,577
so you have to fill these out.

396
00:33:14,744 --> 00:33:15,828
Okay.

397
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:18,164
You're gonna have
to wait 24 hours

398
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:19,665
before you can
actually get married.

399
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:21,000
Twenty-four hours? Yeah.

400
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,084
VVhy?

401
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:23,920
Well, this way, you
have 24 hours to decide

402
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:25,603
whether you want to
marry this young man.

403
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:27,089
But I want to marry him!

404
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:29,050
In 24 hours.

405
00:33:29,884 --> 00:33:34,096
So, okay. All right. Yeah, so
we can't get married today.

406
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:38,267
Okay.

407
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:45,983
This system really kills the
spontaneity factor, hmm?

408
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:49,654
We're already married in the spirit world.

409
00:33:50,363 --> 00:33:51,364
Shit.

410
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:53,449
Hello?

411
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:54,742
Hi.

412
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:55,910
Hi.

413
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:57,078
Hi.

414
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,454
Hi. What's up?

415
00:33:58,538 --> 00:33:59,747
You called like five times.

416
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:00,998
I did.

417
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:02,875
Why would I do that?

418
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:05,002
Why might I call five times?

419
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:06,837
I don't know.

420
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:08,381
I was running
the electrophoretic drill,

421
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:10,299
you know, just another Tuesday.

422
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:13,636
And I started sequencing the
genes of this strange worm...

423
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:16,222
called Eisenia fetida.

424
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:17,557
Go on.

425
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:19,475
And, uh...

426
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:22,645
I found the PAX6 master switch.

427
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:25,231
No.

428
00:34:25,523 --> 00:34:26,607
Yeah.

429
00:34:26,774 --> 00:34:28,234
Are you serious right now?
Are you fucking with me?

430
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:29,694
Do you know what this means?

431
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:33,447
We found an origin species and we can
build an eye from scratch.

432
00:34:34,574 --> 00:34:35,700
Holy sh...

433
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:42,164
Um, does it have the same amino
acid sequence as humans?

434
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:44,875
I can't even talk right now.

435
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:46,669
I feel like I'm gonna
piss myself.

436
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:48,045
Can you just come in here?

437
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:50,172
Okay, I'm coming in right now.
You're amazing.

438
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:51,882
Bye-BYe, bye, bye.

439
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,761
Who was that?

440
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:58,264
That was Karen, um,
my rotating...

441
00:34:58,431 --> 00:35:00,850
Well, my lab partner.

442
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:04,770
I have to go into
the lab right now.

443
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:06,522
Do you want to come with me?

444
00:35:06,856 --> 00:35:08,983
On our wedding day?

445
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,570
Well, technically, it's not
our wedding day today.

446
00:35:12,737 --> 00:35:15,114
And we've been married forever

447
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:16,991
in the spiritual world, right?

448
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,578
Sofi, please come in with me.
It's really important.

449
00:35:20,745 --> 00:35:21,746
Sure.

450
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:22,830
Yeah?

451
00:35:23,748 --> 00:35:25,666
Mmm. It's fine. Let's go.

452
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,461
Well, don't be upset about it.

453
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:30,087
Let's put our rings on.

454
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:31,661
I don't want to, it's bad luck.

455
00:35:31,756 --> 00:35:34,175
I don't believe in luck.

456
00:35:35,635 --> 00:35:38,512
I do believe we've known each
other since forever, though.

457
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,641
Really?

458
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:44,060
Yeah. You know how?

459
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:47,229
When the Big Bang happened...

460
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:48,636
all the atoms in the universe

461
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:50,066
were all smashed together...

462
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,902
into one little dot
that exploded outward.

463
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:56,739
So my atoms and your atoms were
certainly together then...

464
00:35:56,906 --> 00:36:00,159
and, who knows, probably
smashed together several times...

465
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:03,287
in the last 13.7 billion years.

466
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:06,540
So my atoms have
known your atoms...

467
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:10,002
and they've always
known your atoms.

468
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:13,714
My atoms have always
loved your atoms.

469
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:23,641
Let's go!

470
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:32,274
Karen.

471
00:36:35,111 --> 00:36:36,278
Hi.

472
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:38,823
Hey. Hi.

473
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:40,950
This is Sofi. This is Karen.

474
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:42,535
Karen, this is Sofi. Hi.

475
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:45,663
She's my wife.

476
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:47,915
Welcome, um...

477
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:50,418
What do you wanna see?

478
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:52,128
I wanna see everything.

479
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:55,131
Uh, so, I have this gel.

480
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:58,259
And it aligns?

481
00:36:58,843 --> 00:37:03,097
The alignment crossed PAX6
proteins, 98 percent identity.

482
00:37:04,724 --> 00:37:06,475
Are these the worms?

483
00:37:09,353 --> 00:37:11,439
They can't see anything.

484
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:13,941
Not for long.

485
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:37,840
You know, um, I should...
I'm gonna go take a shower.

486
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:40,426
You've seen it.

487
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:42,261
Shower?

488
00:37:42,428 --> 00:37:43,596
I should shower,
brush my teeth...

489
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:44,919
Wait, you're gonna go right now?

490
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,515
Um, yeah.

491
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:50,436
I'm sure you want to show your
wife around the lab and...

492
00:37:50,603 --> 00:37:52,730
Okay. Are you sure?

493
00:37:54,857 --> 00:37:57,943
Okay, well, uh, this is amazing.

494
00:37:58,486 --> 00:38:01,197
The beginning of
something amazing.

495
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,411
It was nice to meet you.

496
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:10,456
Amazing stuff, Karen.

497
00:38:10,623 --> 00:38:12,625
- Bye.
- Bye.

498
00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:32,561
What's wrong?

499
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:37,358
I know something's wrong, so...

500
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:42,196
You leave me everyday
to torture little worms?

501
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:49,328
We're not torturing worms, Sofi.

502
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:53,499
If you're interested,
we're modifying organisms.

503
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:57,795
In this case, they happen to
be worms that are blind...

504
00:38:57,962 --> 00:38:59,642
and we're modifying
them to have vision.

505
00:39:00,214 --> 00:39:02,675
You can make blind worms see?

506
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:05,010
Kind of.

507
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:07,137
I mean, we can now, maybe.

508
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:10,349
You think that's a good idea?

509
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:12,476
Do you think it's a bad idea?

510
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:17,606
I think it's dangerous
to play God.

511
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,235
Sofi, I believe in proof.

512
00:39:22,278 --> 00:39:26,699
There is no proof that there
is some magical spirit...

513
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,787
uh, that's invisible, living
above us, right on top of us.

514
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:34,832
How many senses do worms have?

515
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:36,375
They have two.

516
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:39,128
Smell and touch.

517
00:39:39,587 --> 00:39:40,588
VVhy?

518
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:41,755
So...

519
00:39:42,882 --> 00:39:45,050
they live without
any ability to see

520
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:47,595
or even know about light, right?

521
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:53,058
The notion of light
to them is unimaginable.

522
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:55,227
Yeah.

523
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:58,731
But we humans...

524
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:03,402
we know that light exists.

525
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:06,572
All around them...

526
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:08,908
right on top of them...

527
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:11,911
they can't sense it.

528
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:16,081
But with a little mutation,
they do. Right?

529
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:17,374
Correct.

530
00:40:20,044 --> 00:40:21,045
So...

531
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:24,089
Doctor Eye...

532
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:26,926
perhaps some humans,

533
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:28,677
rare humans...

534
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:31,680
have mutated to
have another sense.

535
00:40:32,306 --> 00:40:34,224
A spirit sense.

536
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:39,438
And can perceive a world that
is right on top of us...

537
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,190
everywhere.

538
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:46,111
Just like the light
on these worms.

539
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:54,411
So, you're a mutant.

540
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:55,704
Mmm-hmm.

541
00:40:57,581 --> 00:41:00,167
And I'm not the only one.

542
00:41:16,767 --> 00:41:17,810
Ow! Oh...

543
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,895
Jesus! Are you okay?

544
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:21,188
I got formaldehyde in my eye.
Here, let me see.

545
00:41:21,355 --> 00:41:22,356
Get the splash kit.

546
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:23,607
What is it?

547
00:41:23,774 --> 00:41:25,609
Fuck! What is it? Tell me!

548
00:41:25,776 --> 00:41:27,778
It's yellow,
it's right over there!

549
00:41:27,945 --> 00:41:30,656
It's yellow! Call Karen!
Fucking call Karen, now!

550
00:41:30,823 --> 00:41:32,908
Where's the number?
The number's by the door.

551
00:41:33,534 --> 00:41:34,868
By the door.

552
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:37,204
Got it.

553
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:49,091
We should do this every Friday.

554
00:41:51,969 --> 00:41:53,762
How many fingers
am I holding up?

555
00:41:55,973 --> 00:41:56,974
Twelve.

556
00:41:57,474 --> 00:41:59,560
He's not blind, so that's good.

557
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:01,429
I think you're gonna be fine.

558
00:42:01,437 --> 00:42:02,479
Are you okay?

559
00:42:03,939 --> 00:42:04,940
Yeah.

560
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:08,068
Okay.

561
00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:09,737
Thank you. Yeah.

562
00:42:10,738 --> 00:42:14,450
You're gonna feel fine
in 12 hours or something.

563
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:16,452
I'll call tomorrow
to check in on him.

564
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:18,328
Thank you. Yeah, of course.

565
00:42:36,597 --> 00:42:38,557
This is funny.

566
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,893
Yeah. It's, um...

567
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,480
strange.

568
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:47,566
Find me.

569
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:51,195
Whoa.

570
00:42:52,738 --> 00:42:53,947
Whoa, what?

571
00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:00,913
We are in the middle
of two floors.

572
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,498
We stopped.

573
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:06,001
Hmm? Mmm.

574
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:08,962
We should call the super.

575
00:43:09,213 --> 00:43:12,132
The super what? The super.
The superintendent.

576
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:13,967
The guy that fixes the building.

577
00:43:14,051 --> 00:43:15,427
Can you call him?

578
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:18,388
I don't know this guy.
I don't have his number.

579
00:43:19,181 --> 00:43:20,599
Of course you don't.

580
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:22,017
Here.

581
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:25,938
It's under "Super."

582
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,776
What? Your phone is dead.

583
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,986
It's dead? Yeah.

584
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:35,864
Oh, come on, relax.

585
00:43:36,323 --> 00:43:38,450
You're so irresponsible.

586
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:40,369
Okay.

587
00:43:48,669 --> 00:43:50,420
Want me to call Karen?

588
00:43:55,843 --> 00:43:56,844
Don't be a child.

589
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:02,307
You live in this fairy,
magical, fantasy land.

590
00:44:04,268 --> 00:44:07,646
It's a fucking lie
and you know it's a lie.

591
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:09,606
That's a lie that
you wanna believe,

592
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,192
like a child. Like a child.

593
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,921
Okay.

594
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,132
Okay. Come on.

595
00:44:35,632 --> 00:44:36,675
What's gonna happen?

596
00:44:36,842 --> 00:44:38,177
I'll boost you up.

597
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:40,554
No. You go first
and you pull me up.

598
00:44:40,721 --> 00:44:42,848
Sofi, come on, go. I'm not going first.
You go first.

599
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:44,808
Look at you, you're so scared.
Come on.

600
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:49,188
Be careful.

601
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:51,982
Look how easy that was.

602
00:44:52,149 --> 00:44:53,150
Come on.

603
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,818
Come on, let's go.

604
00:44:56,904 --> 00:44:58,113
Sofia, come on!

605
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:03,493
Give me your hand.

606
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:06,580
Give me your hand.

607
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,041
SOFII Oh.

608
00:45:09,124 --> 00:45:10,292
Okay, come on.

609
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:13,128
There you go, you're fine.

610
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:15,923
Here we go.

611
00:45:20,302 --> 00:45:21,303
Oh.

612
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:45,035
SOfi?

613
00:45:52,334 --> 00:45:53,460
SOfi?

614
00:45:53,794 --> 00:45:54,920
SOfi?

615
00:45:56,088 --> 00:45:57,381
SOfi?

616
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,761
Ah!

617
00:46:03,262 --> 00:46:04,638
SOfil.

618
00:48:31,201 --> 00:48:32,369
Hello?

619
00:48:32,452 --> 00:48:33,829
Can I come over?

620
00:48:35,038 --> 00:48:36,039
No.

621
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:39,835
Maybe.

622
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:42,337
What if I bring
you something that

623
00:48:42,421 --> 00:48:44,047
I know will take
your breath away?

624
00:48:49,428 --> 00:48:50,929
It has an eye.

625
00:48:51,096 --> 00:48:54,391
I mean, just light-sensitive
cells, but we did it.

626
00:48:54,558 --> 00:48:56,685
Mutations are holding.

627
00:48:57,853 --> 00:48:59,229
You did it.

628
00:49:03,692 --> 00:49:06,570
That's the first step
in a really long process.

629
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:10,949
It's gonna end as a worm in a box ifyou
don't get your ass back in the lab.

630
00:49:16,872 --> 00:49:18,457
Why don't you eat something?

631
00:49:43,565 --> 00:49:44,566
Fuck.

632
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:08,775
He claims to
have put to rest the notion...

633
00:51:08,942 --> 00:51:12,445
that the eye was made
by an intelligent designer.

634
00:51:12,612 --> 00:51:14,739
Dr. Gray, you made some
mutants in a laboratory...

635
00:51:14,906 --> 00:51:17,075
and now you expect
all religious people

636
00:51:17,158 --> 00:51:19,286
to just throw away
their beliefs?

637
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:23,164
Well, I expect them to fight
me every step of the way.

638
00:51:23,373 --> 00:51:25,875
But I do implore them to look
at the evidence and data

639
00:51:25,959 --> 00:51:27,502
we've collected here.

640
00:51:27,669 --> 00:51:29,963
These specimens are
practical examples

641
00:51:30,046 --> 00:51:32,507
of every stage
of eye development.

642
00:51:32,674 --> 00:51:33,967
Dr. Ian Gray, uh,
thanks for being here.

643
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:35,343
Thanks for having me.

644
00:51:35,635 --> 00:51:38,054
The book is The Complete Eye.

645
00:51:38,972 --> 00:51:40,015
All right.

646
00:51:44,728 --> 00:51:45,729
How'd I do?

647
00:51:45,895 --> 00:51:47,856
Why do you do that
thing with your face?

648
00:51:48,023 --> 00:51:49,065
What? What thing?

649
00:51:49,149 --> 00:51:50,400
The thing. Where you're like...

650
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:51,818
You did nothing with your face.

651
00:51:51,901 --> 00:51:53,361
It was good, it was good.

652
00:51:53,528 --> 00:51:56,865
Man, you should have joined the
private sector, Professor.

653
00:51:57,032 --> 00:52:01,995
It's crazy. Iris Biometrics is
exploding all over the world.

654
00:52:02,537 --> 00:52:04,539
Pfltakelove over money any day.

655
00:52:04,706 --> 00:52:07,000
Wow, that's mature of you.

656
00:52:07,709 --> 00:52:09,878
You think I could really get a job there?

657
00:52:11,713 --> 00:52:12,881
Thank you.

658
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:18,720
You all right?

659
00:52:19,596 --> 00:52:21,056
Any more drinks?

660
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:25,560
Uh, yeah, it's just a
smell, I can't place it.

661
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,729
Maybe it's your perfume?

662
00:52:28,438 --> 00:52:30,065
Any more drinks?

663
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:33,443
Uh, no, actually, we'd
like to know what your perfume is.

664
00:52:33,568 --> 00:52:34,768
You don't have to answer that.

665
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:36,154
It's Trésor.

666
00:52:36,363 --> 00:52:37,572
Tréso r?

667
00:52:38,031 --> 00:52:40,075
- It's lovely.
- Thank you.

668
00:52:40,492 --> 00:52:42,661
I'm okay with drink.

669
00:52:43,536 --> 00:52:44,704
It's Trésor.

670
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:45,872
It's French.

671
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:47,415
Are you hitting on the waitress

672
00:52:47,499 --> 00:52:49,918
in front of your pregnant wife?

673
00:52:50,377 --> 00:52:51,961
I don't know if you know
this about me, Kenny,

674
00:52:52,045 --> 00:52:53,546
but the gene forjealousy?

675
00:52:53,713 --> 00:52:56,091
- Recessive.
- That's good.

676
00:52:56,257 --> 00:52:59,803
I'm going to the dance floor
with my pregnant, lovely wife.

677
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:02,042
I'm gonna
get her number for you.

678
00:53:02,055 --> 00:53:03,223
Please, thank you.

679
00:53:07,477 --> 00:53:11,856
I'm so looking forward to
brainwashing this child with you.

680
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,652
You want to know
what I was thinking?

681
00:53:15,902 --> 00:53:16,986
IAN; What?

682
00:53:21,241 --> 00:53:24,369
What if we turn
the garage into a lab?

683
00:53:25,912 --> 00:53:28,915
And the baby could be
our first test subject.

684
00:53:31,835 --> 00:53:33,503
That's a great idea.

685
00:53:34,671 --> 00:53:36,965
Is there something
ethically wrong with that?

686
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:41,886
No.

687
00:53:50,061 --> 00:53:51,855
You know what I wanna do?

688
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:55,942
I think we should leave.

689
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:22,343
I'm, uh, picking up a prescription
for my wife, Karen Gray.

690
00:54:39,402 --> 00:54:41,863
How about if I sing to you?

691
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:47,202
Beautiful dreamer.

692
00:54:49,204 --> 00:54:50,789
Wake onto me.

693
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,805
Sounds of the rude world.

694
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:09,057
Heard in the day.

695
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:14,813
Lulled by the moonlight
Have all passed away.

696
00:55:21,361 --> 00:55:24,155
Beautiful dreamer.

697
00:55:25,615 --> 00:55:27,659
Wake onto me.

698
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:35,250
Starlight and dew drops
are waiting for thee.

699
00:55:45,385 --> 00:55:48,596
Say hello to the camera.

700
00:55:51,057 --> 00:55:53,268
Sofi, come on.

701
00:55:54,978 --> 00:55:56,396
Be nice.

702
00:55:56,563 --> 00:55:58,481
Be nice. Come on,
act like a lady.

703
00:56:00,149 --> 00:56:02,110
Hello. Hello.

704
00:56:02,735 --> 00:56:04,028
Hello.

705
00:56:04,696 --> 00:56:07,323
I want you. I want you more.

706
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:26,009
Don't stop.

707
00:56:29,554 --> 00:56:31,973
I wanna know
what's turning you on.

708
00:56:51,367 --> 00:56:53,828
I never do this.

709
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:14,140
I sometimes think about the
cause and effect of it...

710
00:57:15,725 --> 00:57:19,062
And I think about how, and I
don't feel guilty for this...

711
00:57:20,772 --> 00:57:24,567
but I think about how if I hadn't
called you into the lab that day...

712
00:57:27,612 --> 00:57:31,616
she would maybe still be
here and you would be with her.

713
00:57:35,203 --> 00:57:38,498
Can I tell you something that
makes me feel like a monster?

714
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:43,628
That day in the elevator...

715
00:57:44,462 --> 00:57:46,089
I thought to myself...

716
00:57:46,255 --> 00:57:50,009
"Am I going to be stuck with
this child the rest of my life?"

717
00:57:51,678 --> 00:57:54,806
And then the next moment
she was dead.

718
00:57:55,932 --> 00:57:59,811
We were never gonna
be together, Karen.

719
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:03,982
I just never got closure.

720
00:58:04,983 --> 00:58:08,319
Inevergot to say goodbye.

721
00:58:14,492 --> 00:58:15,785
Kiss me.

722
00:58:45,398 --> 00:58:48,526
Iris scanning is a new
identification measure...

723
00:58:48,693 --> 00:58:50,903
taken up by the more
sophisticated hospitals.

724
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,239
We know what iris scanning is.

725
00:58:53,406 --> 00:58:55,616
We've had it in our lab
for a decade.

726
00:58:55,783 --> 00:58:58,536
Well, it's still new
to the general public.

727
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:03,249
Now, we are not yet legally
required to scan eyes...

728
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:05,209
but we adopted the technology

729
00:59:05,293 --> 00:59:08,337
and use it with
the parents' consent.

730
00:59:08,713 --> 00:59:10,590
I'm fine with it. You, uh...

731
00:59:10,757 --> 00:59:12,925
Scan. Yeah, do the scan.

732
00:59:13,092 --> 00:59:14,635
I dim the lights.

733
00:59:15,803 --> 00:59:18,264
The system is non-obtrusive...

734
00:59:18,723 --> 00:59:22,894
and, in all actuality, is
just taking photo of the eyes.

735
00:59:24,062 --> 00:59:25,063
There you go.

736
00:59:25,146 --> 00:59:26,147
Come here, Tobias.

737
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:27,732
- Oh, thank you.
- You got it?

738
00:59:28,316 --> 00:59:31,069
Yes, I got it. Thank you.

739
00:59:32,278 --> 00:59:33,696
What happens then is...

740
00:59:33,863 --> 00:59:37,825
the computer finds a bunch of
points in the crevices of the eye...

741
00:59:37,992 --> 00:59:40,244
Yeah, we understand
how it works.

742
00:59:50,755 --> 00:59:51,756
Forgive me.

743
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:54,634
These systems are sort of new.
Can you tell?

744
00:59:55,593 --> 00:59:57,178
Paul Edgar Dairy?

745
00:59:57,261 --> 00:59:59,097
Sounds like a pirate.

746
00:59:59,722 --> 01:00:04,644
If this happens, I'm supposed
to punch in a key and reboot.

747
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:20,827
There we go.

748
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:24,789
So I'll just put in his info.
What is his name?

749
01:00:26,207 --> 01:00:28,751
I like Paul Edgar Dairy,
it's fine.

750
01:00:28,918 --> 01:00:33,339
Tobias George Gray,
after his grandfather.

751
01:00:40,179 --> 01:00:41,180
Hello?

752
01:00:41,222 --> 01:00:42,515
Hi, is this Ian Gray?

753
01:00:42,682 --> 01:00:43,683
It is.

754
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:45,143
My name is Dr. Simmons.

755
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:46,894
I work in conjunction with Yale

756
01:00:46,978 --> 01:00:48,146
and the Greenwich Hospital...

757
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:51,149
where you and your wife
gave birth in July.

758
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:53,651
Yeah? Ls everything okay?

759
01:00:53,818 --> 01:00:57,280
Yes. Everything's okay,
please don't be alarmed.

760
01:00:57,446 --> 01:01:01,701
We would however like to run a
few simple tests on Tobias.

761
01:01:01,951 --> 01:01:05,746
His test results may suggest,
although highly unlikely...

762
01:01:05,913 --> 01:01:08,207
the possibility of early autism.

763
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:11,252
You know I'm a doctor.
What test results?

764
01:01:11,419 --> 01:01:14,005
The... We've pinpointed, uh...
Uh...

765
01:01:14,172 --> 01:01:16,257
Uh, can you hold
on a moment, please?

766
01:01:16,465 --> 01:01:17,967
Karen, listen to this.

767
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:21,220
Yeah.

768
01:01:21,304 --> 01:01:23,014
We've pinpointed
an array of molecular

769
01:01:23,097 --> 01:01:24,932
<i>compounds that
appear in the urine...</i>

770
01:01:25,099 --> 01:01:26,934
of children with autism.

771
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:29,979
And Tobias showcased
a few of them.

772
01:01:30,146 --> 01:01:33,900
I promise it's unlikely,
but worth checking out...

773
01:01:34,066 --> 01:01:38,738
and we have very simple non-obtrusive
tests and we'll be done in an hour.

774
01:01:39,071 --> 01:01:41,073
What was your name
and affiliation?

775
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:42,491
Dr. Janet Simmons.

776
01:01:42,658 --> 01:01:45,203
I run a research lab
on child autism...

777
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:47,872
in conjunction with Yale
and the Greenwich Hospital.

778
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:49,040
Simmons, you said?

779
01:01:49,207 --> 01:01:50,374
Janet Simmons.

780
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:53,544
Our clinic is in Stamford,
not too far from there.

781
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:56,714
It's important to
check this soon.

782
01:01:56,881 --> 01:01:59,091
There's no alarming rush,

783
01:01:59,175 --> 01:02:01,260
but we could see him today.

784
01:02:01,427 --> 01:02:04,055
Okay, thank you. You'll hear from us.

785
01:02:11,854 --> 01:02:13,481
Baby, I love you.

786
01:02:15,233 --> 01:02:18,778
Tobias. Look here, look here.

787
01:02:36,837 --> 01:02:37,838
I'm not sure I understand

788
01:02:37,922 --> 01:02:39,757
how this is testing for autism.

789
01:02:40,132 --> 01:02:41,550
The blood and urine
test will check

790
01:02:41,634 --> 01:02:42,927
for molecular compounds.

791
01:02:43,135 --> 01:02:45,054
This test is purely perceptual.

792
01:02:45,221 --> 01:02:48,641
Tracking the child's eye
movements and attractions.

793
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:22,318
Okay, that's enough.
I'm gonna...

794
01:04:22,401 --> 01:04:24,070
Yeah. The test is over.

795
01:04:34,663 --> 01:04:36,999
If you are calling
regarding an existing file...

796
01:04:37,166 --> 01:04:39,460
please enter your
seven-digit session number.

797
01:04:42,755 --> 01:04:46,592
This Dr. Simmons is up to something.
Child autism my ass.

798
01:04:46,759 --> 01:04:49,637
I keep running through her studies.
What was she doing?

799
01:04:49,804 --> 01:04:51,263
Two images side by side.

800
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:53,766
Two images,
similar but different.

801
01:04:53,933 --> 01:04:55,413
Tobias would look
at one or the other.

802
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:58,479
Do you remember anything
specific about the images?

803
01:04:58,646 --> 01:05:01,357
Something connected to something?
Something we could look up?

804
01:05:02,441 --> 01:05:05,403
There was a farmhouse.

805
01:05:08,489 --> 01:05:11,992
There was, um... Dan's
Diner in Boise, Idaho.

806
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:13,869
Whatever that means.

807
01:05:16,247 --> 01:05:17,790
Why, that's a real place.

808
01:05:42,231 --> 01:05:43,315
Hello.

809
01:05:43,482 --> 01:05:44,650
Vvhatcanl getyou?

810
01:05:44,817 --> 01:05:47,403
Um, just a cup of coffee.

811
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:48,988
Sure thing.

812
01:05:55,911 --> 01:05:58,247
I'm not from around here.
I was wondering...

813
01:05:58,414 --> 01:06:01,125
is there anything
interesting in town to see?

814
01:06:01,292 --> 01:06:02,585
Not much around these parts.

815
01:06:02,793 --> 01:06:06,005
'Less you, uh, fancy visiting
some cows down at the Dairy farm.

816
01:06:07,006 --> 01:06:08,799
- There's a dairy farm. Mmm-hmm.

817
01:06:08,883 --> 01:06:10,634
That'll be a dollar. Oh.

818
01:06:11,177 --> 01:06:12,261
Of course.

819
01:06:13,804 --> 01:06:15,723
Where is the dairy farm located?

820
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:17,433
Uh, take a left, about
two miles down the road.

821
01:06:17,516 --> 01:06:18,851
Can't miss it.

822
01:06:31,822 --> 01:06:33,222
We'll have them
through in a moment.

823
01:06:33,324 --> 01:06:34,325
Oh. Okay.

824
01:06:34,742 --> 01:06:36,785
Come on.

825
01:06:39,788 --> 01:06:41,832
Is this the dairy farm?

826
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:44,043
Indeed, it is.

827
01:06:45,544 --> 01:06:47,129
These are milking cows?

828
01:06:47,296 --> 01:06:48,881
These are meat cows,
not milking cows.

829
01:06:49,507 --> 01:06:51,550
I'm Julie Dairy.
This is my family's farm.

830
01:06:52,343 --> 01:06:53,385
Julie Dairy.

831
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:57,598
Uh, Paul Edgar Dairy.
Are you related to him?

832
01:06:59,225 --> 01:07:00,768
Yes, he's my father.

833
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:04,688
Is he here?

834
01:07:06,023 --> 01:07:09,026
You're clearly not with
the biography association.

835
01:07:09,193 --> 01:07:10,903
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

836
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:13,822
Some documentary crew came
through here a few months ago...

837
01:07:13,989 --> 01:07:16,283
wanting to do a story on
the great Paul Edgar Dairy...

838
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:18,536
the only black farmer in Boise.

839
01:07:18,827 --> 01:07:20,371
They took some pictures.

840
01:07:20,538 --> 01:07:23,374
I liked the story and they
said they'd follow up.

841
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:26,835
You Okay?

842
01:07:30,673 --> 01:07:32,383
How you doing there?

843
01:07:34,802 --> 01:07:35,886
I'm okay.

844
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:39,014
I'm just, uh, having
a moment of déjé vu.

845
01:07:39,557 --> 01:07:42,977
Can we fetch you some
water, or a cup of tea?

846
01:07:43,352 --> 01:07:46,939
I'd really love to meet
Paul if that was possible.

847
01:07:49,525 --> 01:07:52,653
What if we just start at
the beginning and break it down?

848
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:54,738
In the hospital,
Tobias' eyes come up

849
01:07:54,822 --> 01:07:56,323
as a match with
Paul Edgar Dairy...

850
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:57,700
which is not correct

851
01:07:57,783 --> 01:07:59,243
because Tobias has blue eyes...

852
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:00,953
and Paul Edgar Dairy
has brown eyes.

853
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:04,123
Uh, no, iris biometrics
is not based on color.

854
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:05,916
It's based on the unique crypts,

855
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,793
furrows and shapes
in the texture.

856
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:11,171
S0, maybe Tobias and Paul have the
same iris pattern.

857
01:08:11,338 --> 01:08:12,715
Statistically impossible.

858
01:08:12,881 --> 01:08:14,842
Second data point...

859
01:08:15,009 --> 01:08:17,386
Tobias and Paul have
some kind ofconnecflon.

860
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:19,638
It's not our test,
so we don't know.

861
01:08:19,805 --> 01:08:21,765
And the third
data point is that...

862
01:08:21,932 --> 01:08:25,603
Paul Edgar Dairy dies
before Tobias is born.

863
01:08:25,853 --> 01:08:27,396
Was conceived.

864
01:08:28,314 --> 01:08:31,108
Was conceived. Because
Tobias was born in July...

865
01:08:31,275 --> 01:08:34,612
and Paul Edgar Dairy
dies in September 2012.

866
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:36,113
That's ten months.

867
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:37,823
What are you guys
talking about right now?

868
01:08:37,906 --> 01:08:39,450
You guys sound
like crazy people.

869
01:08:39,617 --> 01:08:41,660
Okay? What is this
connection referencing?

870
01:08:41,827 --> 01:08:42,953
Doctor...

871
01:08:43,037 --> 01:08:44,163
Jan... Dr. Simmons.

872
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:45,331
From Yale.

873
01:08:45,414 --> 01:08:46,915
She did this test on Tobias.

874
01:08:47,082 --> 01:08:48,542
Dr. Simmons?

875
01:08:48,709 --> 01:08:49,793
From Yale?

876
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,379
She's one of five people
who have access

877
01:08:52,463 --> 01:08:54,173
to the eye database.

878
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:57,635
My company owns a
patent on iris biometrics...

879
01:08:57,801 --> 01:09:00,429
and consolidate all their
data into one database...

880
01:09:00,596 --> 01:09:03,015
and Simmons is one of five
people that have access.

881
01:09:03,182 --> 01:09:05,059
But you have access to it, too.

882
01:09:05,684 --> 01:09:06,685
Sort of.

883
01:09:06,852 --> 01:09:08,604
I can find the iris code...

884
01:09:08,771 --> 01:09:10,606
run it and see
if it's in the system

885
01:09:10,689 --> 01:09:12,483
and then check the IP address...

886
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:14,526
and check when and where
it was registered.

887
01:09:14,693 --> 01:09:15,693
I can do that.

888
01:09:15,736 --> 01:09:17,029
How do you do that?

889
01:09:17,196 --> 01:09:18,322
Look into that.

890
01:09:18,489 --> 01:09:20,449
Okay. Other eye.

891
01:09:21,325 --> 01:09:23,160
All right. Okay.

892
01:09:24,703 --> 01:09:27,831
So, I can't get your
name or biographicals...

893
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:30,000
but I can see that
you are in the system.

894
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:31,168
Amazing.

895
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:32,252
Right. Hmm.

896
01:09:32,378 --> 01:09:36,173
And that you were registered

897
01:09:36,256 --> 01:09:37,716
at the lab in 2005...

898
01:09:37,883 --> 01:09:40,636
and the same should
be for Karen and myself.

899
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:44,340
What are you thinking, Karen?

900
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:46,225
Well, check this out.

901
01:09:46,392 --> 01:09:48,560
So, Paul and Tobias

902
01:09:48,644 --> 01:09:50,771
have the same iris
patterns, let's just say.

903
01:09:50,854 --> 01:09:52,147
Mmm. And there's some
sort of connection.

904
01:09:52,314 --> 01:09:56,443
So the next logical step in
our scientific inquiry is...

905
01:09:57,111 --> 01:09:59,238
to find someone that we do know

906
01:09:59,321 --> 01:10:00,989
who's a duplicate in the system.

907
01:10:01,156 --> 01:10:02,616
Like a family
member who has died.

908
01:10:02,783 --> 01:10:04,660
That's it. We need another match.

909
01:10:05,077 --> 01:10:07,037
Guys, this is
statistically impossible.

910
01:10:07,204 --> 01:10:08,539
You're not gonna find anything.

911
01:10:08,622 --> 01:10:10,666
Can you get a scan from a photo?

912
01:10:10,833 --> 01:10:12,626
It has to be high-res
and in focus.

913
01:10:12,793 --> 01:10:14,002
Technically, I can do it.

914
01:10:14,169 --> 01:10:18,132
I have hundreds of high-res
photos of people's eyes.

915
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:19,967
All right. You can scan these.

916
01:10:20,134 --> 01:10:21,593
Give me the hard drive.

917
01:10:24,221 --> 01:10:26,432
This is ridiculous.
Who do you want me to run?

918
01:10:26,515 --> 01:10:28,684
Mmm. Run my father,

919
01:10:28,809 --> 01:10:31,645
Tobias George Gray.
He died two years ago.

920
01:10:34,565 --> 01:10:36,191
He's in the system...

921
01:10:37,818 --> 01:10:41,447
and he's registered
at Heathrow, 2006.

922
01:10:41,613 --> 01:10:44,950
That makes sense. He was
traveling there frequently.

923
01:10:45,117 --> 01:10:47,703
Try, um, my uncle, Basil.

924
01:10:49,455 --> 01:10:51,623
Died seven years ago ofcancen.

925
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:55,377
All right. Not found.

926
01:10:55,544 --> 01:10:56,920
Try your grandparents.

927
01:10:57,004 --> 01:10:58,255
My grandparents. Bev and Barry.

928
01:10:58,630 --> 01:10:59,631
Bev.

929
01:11:01,675 --> 01:11:03,260
She's in the system.

930
01:11:03,677 --> 01:11:05,512
Registered...

931
01:11:06,472 --> 01:11:08,682
at Schiphol airport
in Amsterdam, 1998.

932
01:11:08,849 --> 01:11:10,601
How many people
are in the database?

933
01:11:10,768 --> 01:11:14,021
There's like hundreds of millions.
There's a billion soon.

934
01:11:14,188 --> 01:11:16,523
- Try my grandparents.
- Right there.

935
01:11:17,149 --> 01:11:18,859
Judy is in the system.

936
01:11:19,067 --> 01:11:21,445
She's registered
at a nursing home

937
01:11:21,528 --> 01:11:22,696
in New Haven in 2009.

938
01:11:22,863 --> 01:11:23,864
And Malcolm?

939
01:11:24,031 --> 01:11:25,032
Malcolm.

940
01:11:25,491 --> 01:11:26,909
Not found.

941
01:11:28,827 --> 01:11:30,245
All right, so anybody else?

942
01:11:33,165 --> 01:11:34,500
Sofi.

943
01:11:39,588 --> 01:11:41,548
- Okay, try Sofi.
- Okay.

944
01:11:42,216 --> 01:11:43,217
Sofi.

945
01:11:54,144 --> 01:11:55,771
She's in the system.

946
01:11:55,938 --> 01:11:58,190
That makes sense.
She was probably

947
01:11:58,273 --> 01:12:00,651
scanned when she
came through customs.

948
01:12:01,401 --> 01:12:02,402
No.

949
01:12:02,569 --> 01:12:04,196
It says that the IP
address coordinates

950
01:12:04,279 --> 01:12:05,781
say that she was scanned...

951
01:12:05,948 --> 01:12:08,075
in a community center
in Delhi, India.

952
01:12:08,742 --> 01:12:10,702
She must have traveled there.

953
01:12:10,869 --> 01:12:12,246
Three months ago?

954
01:12:16,416 --> 01:12:18,376
- That doesn't make any sense.
- That's not right.

955
01:12:22,381 --> 01:12:23,757
It's an error.

956
01:12:26,385 --> 01:12:28,762
It's only the seventh one
we've tried.

957
01:12:29,388 --> 01:12:31,014
I need to get some air.

958
01:12:32,516 --> 01:12:35,143
What the fuck is happening?

959
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,649
Did you put him to bed?

960
01:13:22,941 --> 01:13:23,942
Yeah.

961
01:13:32,576 --> 01:13:34,244
You should go to India.

962
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:41,293
Can't go to India.

963
01:13:45,255 --> 01:13:46,965
Can't or won't?

964
01:13:47,132 --> 01:13:49,635
India is not Boise,
Idaho, Karen.

965
01:13:50,177 --> 01:13:53,764
There is someone there with
Sofi's exact iris pattern.

966
01:13:55,807 --> 01:13:57,768
The eyes and the brain
are connected.

967
01:13:57,935 --> 01:14:00,020
If the cellular
structure in the eye

968
01:14:00,103 --> 01:14:01,772
is reoccurring from
person to person...

969
01:14:01,939 --> 01:14:04,024
then maybe
something in the brain...

970
01:14:04,191 --> 01:14:08,028
carries over as well,
like a neurological link.

971
01:14:08,737 --> 01:14:11,823
Maybe the eye really
is some kind of...

972
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:14,284
window to the soul.

973
01:14:14,451 --> 01:14:15,994
Soul, Karen? Soul?

974
01:14:16,161 --> 01:14:19,247
Is my wife really
using the word "soul"?

975
01:14:19,873 --> 01:14:22,000
Like you hold any
validity in that?

976
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:23,293
Call it whatever
you wanna call it.

977
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:26,129
Dr. Simmons was testing
a memory connection...

978
01:14:26,296 --> 01:14:28,799
between our son
and Paul Edgar Dairy.

979
01:14:29,257 --> 01:14:32,427
And it wasn't our test,
but you can go to India...

980
01:14:32,594 --> 01:14:33,994
and you can find
this person with.

981
01:14:34,012 --> 01:14:35,472
Sofi's eyes and you can
do the same.

982
01:14:35,639 --> 01:14:37,015
I can't go there.

983
01:14:37,182 --> 01:14:38,642
It's just India...

984
01:14:38,725 --> 01:14:40,310
Not India! I can't go there!

985
01:14:40,477 --> 01:14:42,479
I can't go back there!
I can't go back

986
01:14:42,562 --> 01:14:44,690
to that part of my life!
I can't do it!

987
01:14:58,078 --> 01:15:00,080
I gotta just let it go.

988
01:15:16,888 --> 01:15:18,682
The man I married...

989
01:15:19,391 --> 01:15:21,685
I don't think he would
let his own grief,

990
01:15:21,768 --> 01:15:24,312
even if it was overwhelming...

991
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:26,399
get in the way of what
could potentially be...

992
01:15:26,481 --> 01:15:30,193
the greatest scientific
discovery the world has ever seen.

993
01:15:33,113 --> 01:15:34,740
This is bigger than you.

994
01:15:35,449 --> 01:15:37,117
It's bigger than me.

995
01:15:38,076 --> 01:15:39,786
It's bigger than Sofi.

996
01:15:39,953 --> 01:15:41,705
Then maybe you should go.

997
01:15:42,414 --> 01:15:46,877
I would, but I...
I didn't know Sofi.

998
01:15:48,503 --> 01:15:50,338
It's a false positive,
you understand?

999
01:15:50,422 --> 01:15:52,174
It's an error.
It has to be an error.

1000
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:54,760
It's statistically
impossible. Data point.

1001
01:15:57,429 --> 01:16:00,223
If I drop this phone
a thousand times,

1002
01:16:00,307 --> 01:16:02,142
a million times...

1003
01:16:02,309 --> 01:16:05,020
and one time, it doesn't fall...

1004
01:16:05,729 --> 01:16:09,608
just once, it hovers in the air.

1005
01:16:12,694 --> 01:16:15,363
That is an error
that's worth looking at.

1006
01:16:16,656 --> 01:16:18,825
You're so fucking stubborn.

1007
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:42,265
Technology has barely touched.

1008
01:16:42,349 --> 01:16:44,017
Mira Devi's daily life.

1009
01:16:44,184 --> 01:16:47,813
In her hut, muscle, not
machines, gets the chores done.

1010
01:16:47,979 --> 01:16:52,150
That is about to change for Mira
and perhaps millions like her.

1011
01:16:52,317 --> 01:16:56,488
At this center, her irises are
scanned with biometric devices.

1012
01:16:57,114 --> 01:17:00,450
They're uploaded and then
sent to a massive server.

1013
01:17:00,617 --> 01:17:02,577
Once this information
is processed...

1014
01:17:02,744 --> 01:17:06,623
out comes a twelve-digit
number for her and her only.

1015
01:17:06,957 --> 01:17:11,169
India's unique identification
program started just a year ago.

1016
01:17:11,336 --> 01:17:13,463
If it succeeds,
India will become

1017
01:17:13,547 --> 01:17:15,632
the first country
in the world...

1018
01:17:15,799 --> 01:17:20,053
using biometric data for identity
purposes on a national scale.

1019
01:17:40,198 --> 01:17:41,199
Oh.

1020
01:17:49,457 --> 01:17:50,750
First time to India?

1021
01:17:52,752 --> 01:17:54,004
It is, actually. Yeah.

1022
01:17:56,047 --> 01:17:57,174
Darryl Mackenzie.

1023
01:17:57,465 --> 01:17:59,050
Uh, Dr. Ian Gray.

1024
01:17:59,593 --> 01:18:01,720
Oh. Doctor. Well.

1025
01:18:03,013 --> 01:18:05,223
Two men, both doing good work.

1026
01:18:07,225 --> 01:18:08,518
What do you do?

1027
01:18:08,685 --> 01:18:10,854
Well, I'm in sales, but, uh...

1028
01:18:13,023 --> 01:18:14,691
Also do The Man's work.

1029
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:19,946
The Lord's work. Oh.

1030
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:22,157
Uh, of course.

1031
01:18:25,702 --> 01:18:26,995
Good night, Dr. Gray.

1032
01:18:27,621 --> 01:18:28,914
Uh, have a good night.

1033
01:18:29,706 --> 01:18:31,541
Hope our paths cross again.

1034
01:19:14,334 --> 01:19:15,627
Hello.

1035
01:19:15,794 --> 01:19:17,379
Hi. Can I help you?

1036
01:19:17,671 --> 01:19:19,673
You seem like
the boss of this place.

1037
01:19:19,839 --> 01:19:22,259
Boss, no. Circus
manager more like it.

1038
01:19:22,425 --> 01:19:24,511
I'm Priya Varma,
how can I help you?

1039
01:19:24,678 --> 01:19:25,929
I'm Dr. Ian Gray.

1040
01:19:26,096 --> 01:19:28,265
I'm visiting from America.

1041
01:19:28,515 --> 01:19:31,226
I have a very strange request.

1042
01:19:31,393 --> 01:19:32,394
Yes?

1043
01:19:33,812 --> 01:19:36,898
I'm looking for someone who was
scanned here a while back.

1044
01:19:37,065 --> 01:19:40,110
The thing is, I don't
have their name.

1045
01:19:40,402 --> 01:19:42,737
All I have is a picture
of their eyes.

1046
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:48,785
This is what
their eyes look like.

1047
01:19:49,077 --> 01:19:50,620
They may not be
this exact color.

1048
01:19:51,454 --> 01:19:52,455
Uh...

1049
01:19:54,249 --> 01:19:55,667
Why are you looking for her?

1050
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:56,990
Is she in some kind of trouble?

1051
01:19:57,544 --> 01:19:58,545
Her?

1052
01:19:59,421 --> 01:20:04,551
Uh, no. Of course not. She's not in
trouble. She's incredibly special.

1053
01:20:04,968 --> 01:20:06,219
You do recognize them?

1054
01:20:06,469 --> 01:20:08,388
I do, if it is
who I think it is.

1055
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:10,307
But why are you looking for her?

1056
01:20:10,473 --> 01:20:12,434
Here's another photo.

1057
01:20:14,269 --> 01:20:16,313
Okay, um, this doesn't
make sense.

1058
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:20,233
These are her eyes, but this
isn't her face around them.

1059
01:20:21,735 --> 01:20:23,611
That's exactly why
I'm looking for her.

1060
01:20:26,990 --> 01:20:28,158
Salomina.

1061
01:20:28,325 --> 01:20:29,451
Salomina? Yeah.

1062
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:32,704
Sweet girl. Very smart girl.

1063
01:20:32,871 --> 01:20:35,498
ButlhavenW seen her recently.

1064
01:20:35,707 --> 01:20:37,834
When was the last time
you saw her?

1065
01:20:38,752 --> 01:20:40,920
Uh... A few months ago.

1066
01:20:42,756 --> 01:20:44,591
Could you help me find her?

1067
01:20:45,175 --> 01:20:46,259
Um...

1068
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,596
I could make a donation
to the community center.

1069
01:20:49,888 --> 01:20:53,600
I mean, I'm going to make a
donation to the community center.

1070
01:20:53,767 --> 01:20:56,269
I don't want to sound crass,
like I'm bribing you...

1071
01:20:56,436 --> 01:20:58,646
but I am kind of bribing you.

1072
01:20:58,813 --> 01:21:00,565
No, of course, I mean, of course

1073
01:21:00,648 --> 01:21:03,276
any donation
would help the center.

1074
01:21:03,610 --> 01:21:04,652
Uh...

1075
01:21:04,903 --> 01:21:06,780
It's very important.

1076
01:21:07,197 --> 01:21:08,490
Please.

1077
01:21:10,033 --> 01:21:11,076
Okay.

1078
01:21:11,576 --> 01:21:14,662
You meet me tomorrow at 12:00...

1079
01:21:15,205 --> 01:21:18,208
at the Okhla market, okay?

1080
01:21:41,022 --> 01:21:43,400
(UANLAUGHS)

1081
01:21:44,901 --> 01:21:46,736
All right.

1082
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:48,530
So you want me
to take a photo of you?

1083
01:21:50,365 --> 01:21:51,783
You wanna see?

1084
01:21:55,245 --> 01:21:56,996
You see? Okay.

1085
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:58,081
Hello.

1086
01:22:03,711 --> 01:22:05,672
I almost didn't come.

1087
01:22:05,839 --> 01:22:07,465
Yeah, I was worried.

1088
01:22:08,174 --> 01:22:09,759
What changed your mind?

1089
01:22:09,926 --> 01:22:12,595
I, uh, did some research on you.

1090
01:22:12,846 --> 01:22:14,139
Uh-Oh.

1091
01:22:16,474 --> 01:22:17,725
Come.

1092
01:22:22,856 --> 01:22:23,857
Hello.

1093
01:22:25,817 --> 01:22:30,113
Do all these children eventually
end up at the community center?

1094
01:22:30,905 --> 01:22:33,867
Some do, but there are
over one million people...

1095
01:22:34,033 --> 01:22:36,953
living in this
30-block radius alone.

1096
01:22:37,328 --> 01:22:39,330
According to the registrar,

1097
01:22:39,414 --> 01:22:41,207
Salomina and her
parents live here.

1098
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:43,710
I'm gonna ask this lady here.

1099
01:22:43,877 --> 01:22:44,961
Okay.

1100
01:23:11,070 --> 01:23:13,615
What's wrong? What'd she say?

1101
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:22,415
She could be living
like a stray dog.

1102
01:23:22,582 --> 01:23:26,377
She's totally alone. Her mother's
dead, her father's dead.

1103
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:29,589
She knows the address
of the community center...

1104
01:23:29,756 --> 01:23:32,800
but Priya said she
hasn't been there in weeks.

1105
01:23:32,967 --> 01:23:35,678
There's a million people
living in a ten-block radius.

1106
01:23:35,845 --> 01:23:38,306
It's gonna be
impossible to find her.

1107
01:23:41,559 --> 01:23:43,311
Well, you shouldn't give up.

1108
01:23:43,478 --> 01:23:46,397
You flew halfway around the world.
You should keep looking.

1109
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,817
At least give it a few days.

1110
01:23:50,527 --> 01:23:52,111
I'm gonna go to bed.

1111
01:23:53,196 --> 01:23:54,197
Goodnight.

1112
01:23:54,614 --> 01:23:55,615
Bye.

1113
01:24:04,374 --> 01:24:05,917
What am I doing here?

1114
01:24:34,153 --> 01:24:35,905
You're mad.

1115
01:24:37,073 --> 01:24:38,741
It's a smoke signal.

1116
01:24:39,033 --> 01:24:40,827
Someone she knows will see it.

1117
01:24:42,245 --> 01:24:45,039
I'm glad you didn't
put my number up there.

1118
01:24:52,255 --> 01:24:53,256
Hello?

1119
01:24:53,423 --> 01:24:54,424
Hello.

1120
01:24:55,216 --> 01:24:56,593
Hi, yes?

1121
01:24:56,759 --> 01:24:59,119
Yeah, my niece has eyes like the
picture board, cash reward.

1122
01:24:59,262 --> 01:25:00,972
Are they just like
the ones in the picture?

1123
01:25:01,139 --> 01:25:02,890
Yes, I think so.

1124
01:25:03,057 --> 01:25:04,100
Like exactly?

1125
01:25:04,267 --> 01:25:05,351
Uh, very much so.

1126
01:25:05,518 --> 01:25:06,519
How old is your niece?

1127
01:25:06,686 --> 01:25:09,772
Eighteen. My other niece is 15.

1128
01:25:10,398 --> 01:25:12,567
Oh. No. Uh, sorry.

1129
01:25:12,984 --> 01:25:15,778
Thank you, no.
Sorry. Wrong person.

1130
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:17,071
Bye.

1131
01:25:24,454 --> 01:25:25,538
Hello?

1132
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,543
Do you speak English?

1133
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:32,253
Yes, I do.

1134
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:34,339
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

1135
01:25:34,505 --> 01:25:37,842
I have the eyes you took
up the advertisement for.

1136
01:25:38,009 --> 01:25:39,052
How old are you?

1137
01:25:39,135 --> 01:25:40,595
24.

1138
01:25:41,012 --> 01:25:43,931
No, sorry. The person I'm
looking for is much younger.

1139
01:25:44,265 --> 01:25:46,517
No, thank you
for calling. Sorry.

1140
01:26:00,490 --> 01:26:01,658
Very good!

1141
01:26:01,866 --> 01:26:03,576
- I'm the best.
- I'm the very best.

1142
01:26:03,743 --> 01:26:05,411
I'm the very best.

1143
01:26:05,495 --> 01:26:06,496
Very good.

1144
01:26:18,508 --> 01:26:21,135
Dr. Gray, are you religious?

1145
01:26:22,345 --> 01:26:23,971
Am I religious?

1146
01:26:24,806 --> 01:26:26,974
Ithoughtyou researched me.

1147
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:28,935
I'm not religious.

1148
01:26:29,102 --> 01:26:30,395
Why not?

1149
01:26:32,730 --> 01:26:35,024
Religion is based on scripture

1150
01:26:35,108 --> 01:26:37,235
written by men
thousands of years ago.

1151
01:26:37,402 --> 01:26:40,446
Those beliefs can't be
changed or challenged.

1152
01:26:40,530 --> 01:26:42,156
They're fixed.

1153
01:26:42,448 --> 01:26:45,576
In science, great thinkers
have written things

1154
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:47,245
very long ago...

1155
01:26:47,412 --> 01:26:50,206
but every generation
improves upon them.

1156
01:26:51,082 --> 01:26:53,000
The words are not holy.

1157
01:26:53,418 --> 01:26:56,629
Einstein is a brilliant man,
but he is not our god.

1158
01:26:57,714 --> 01:26:59,924
He's one step in the evolution

1159
01:27:00,007 --> 01:27:01,175
of knowledge...

1160
01:27:01,342 --> 01:27:04,387
but we always
continue to step forward.

1161
01:27:04,887 --> 01:27:07,557
You know, a scientist
once asked the Dalai Lama...

1162
01:27:07,724 --> 01:27:10,935
"What would you do
if something scientific..."

1163
01:27:11,102 --> 01:27:13,354
"disproved your
religious beliefs?"

1164
01:27:13,855 --> 01:27:15,940
And he said
after much thought...

1165
01:27:16,107 --> 01:27:17,567
"I would look at all the papers"

1166
01:27:17,692 --> 01:27:19,252
"and take a look at
all the research..."

1167
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:22,572
"and really try to
understand things."

1168
01:27:22,905 --> 01:27:24,449
"And in the end, if it was clear"

1169
01:27:24,532 --> 01:27:26,033
"that the scientific evidence..."

1170
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:29,412
"disproved my
spiritual beliefs..."

1171
01:27:29,662 --> 01:27:32,373
"I would change my beliefs."

1172
01:27:32,749 --> 01:27:34,375
That's a good answer.

1173
01:27:38,796 --> 01:27:39,839
Ian.

1174
01:27:41,507 --> 01:27:44,594
What would you do if
something spiritual...

1175
01:27:45,344 --> 01:27:47,889
disproved your
scientific beliefs?

1176
01:28:17,043 --> 01:28:18,628
Hello, love.

1177
01:28:19,003 --> 01:28:20,463
The bank called today.

1178
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:22,298
They said $2,000 a day is going

1179
01:28:22,381 --> 01:28:24,008
to some sketchy
Planet India company.

1180
01:28:24,217 --> 01:28:27,470
It's like 20 K already.
What's going on?

1181
01:28:27,887 --> 01:28:30,306
I put up a billboard.
It know it sounds a bit

1182
01:28:30,389 --> 01:28:32,683
extreme, but it's all
I could think of.

1183
01:28:32,850 --> 01:28:34,560
Ian, it's been weeks.

1184
01:28:35,102 --> 01:28:37,063
I think you should come back.

1185
01:28:39,148 --> 01:28:42,109
Karen, what happened
to turning over

1186
01:28:42,235 --> 01:28:44,070
rocks and finding
nothing is progress?

1187
01:28:44,237 --> 01:28:46,781
I'm down with the big
picture of all this.

1188
01:28:46,864 --> 01:28:48,950
I'm the one who
wanted you to go.

1189
01:28:49,033 --> 01:28:52,370
But failed experiments are
not unknown to us, right?

1190
01:28:52,537 --> 01:28:56,082
We regroup, we look for
more matches, we try again.

1191
01:28:57,959 --> 01:28:59,794
Please come home.

1192
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:36,515
Do you speak English?

1193
01:30:36,682 --> 01:30:38,309
A little.

1194
01:30:38,517 --> 01:30:39,560
A little?

1195
01:30:40,102 --> 01:30:41,270
Yes.

1196
01:30:42,939 --> 01:30:44,357
What's your name?

1197
01:30:44,523 --> 01:30:45,983
Salomina.

1198
01:30:46,150 --> 01:30:47,151
Salomina?

1199
01:30:47,318 --> 01:30:48,319
Yes.

1200
01:30:49,487 --> 01:30:52,198
Salomina, I'm Ian.

1201
01:30:53,532 --> 01:30:55,034
My name's Ian.

1202
01:30:56,786 --> 01:30:57,912
Are you hungry?

1203
01:30:57,995 --> 01:30:59,080
Yes.

1204
01:30:59,246 --> 01:31:00,456
You are?

1205
01:31:00,539 --> 01:31:01,624
Yes.

1206
01:31:04,001 --> 01:31:06,796
Come on, let's get
you some food.

1207
01:31:07,546 --> 01:31:08,589
Come on.

1208
01:31:11,217 --> 01:31:13,135
Priya, I found her.

1209
01:31:13,219 --> 01:31:15,346
I'm going to the hotel.

1210
01:31:15,513 --> 01:31:17,473
Hey! Meet me there.

1211
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:19,475
Listen, I'll be
right there, okay?

1212
01:31:39,286 --> 01:31:41,080
What's your favorite food?

1213
01:31:41,789 --> 01:31:43,332
Strawberry.

1214
01:31:44,458 --> 01:31:46,002
Strawberry? J ust strawberry?

1215
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:54,969
What's your favorite color?

1216
01:31:55,428 --> 01:31:59,432
Pink, purple, blue and green.

1217
01:31:59,598 --> 01:32:01,559
Pink, purple, blue and green?
Blue and green.

1218
01:32:01,642 --> 01:32:02,768
That's so many.

1219
01:32:02,852 --> 01:32:05,438
See my finger?
Can you follow it?

1220
01:32:06,605 --> 01:32:08,024
Very good.

1221
01:32:08,774 --> 01:32:11,360
Very good. Very good. Very good.

1222
01:32:47,521 --> 01:32:48,981
You okay? You comfortable?

1223
01:32:49,482 --> 01:32:51,067
You okay? Yes.

1224
01:32:58,491 --> 01:33:00,076
Are you there? Yeah.

1225
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:09,585
I wanna show you something that
will take your breath away.

1226
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:23,557
Karen, this is Salomina.

1227
01:33:23,724 --> 01:33:26,268
Salomina, this is Karen.

1228
01:33:31,023 --> 01:33:32,525
I need my lab partner.

1229
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:35,528
Okay. Yeah.

1230
01:33:36,695 --> 01:33:37,947
I'm ready.

1231
01:33:38,948 --> 01:33:40,866
Okay, so, Salomina...

1232
01:33:41,784 --> 01:33:44,036
it's a very easy game.

1233
01:33:44,203 --> 01:33:46,080
I'm gonna show you three things

1234
01:33:46,163 --> 01:33:48,040
and you pick the one
that's your favorite.

1235
01:33:48,207 --> 01:33:49,375
Okay. You understand?

1236
01:33:49,542 --> 01:33:50,709
Yes. Okay.

1237
01:33:50,876 --> 01:33:53,212
Commencing experiment one.

1238
01:33:53,671 --> 01:33:55,923
Memory connection
between subjects

1239
01:33:56,006 --> 01:33:57,383
with identical iris patterns.

1240
01:33:57,550 --> 01:33:58,592
Got it.

1241
01:33:59,301 --> 01:34:01,804
Subject, Salomina.

1242
01:34:02,138 --> 01:34:03,222
Sas in...

1243
01:34:03,305 --> 01:34:04,348
Shut the front door.

1244
01:34:05,558 --> 01:34:07,560
- A as in...
- Amazing.

1245
01:34:07,726 --> 01:34:08,811
Lasin...

1246
01:34:08,894 --> 01:34:09,979
Love you.

1247
01:34:12,148 --> 01:34:13,149
O...

1248
01:34:13,232 --> 01:34:14,233
Open-minded.

1249
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:15,401
Masin...

1250
01:34:15,568 --> 01:34:16,569
Maestro.

1251
01:34:16,735 --> 01:34:17,736
Iasin...

1252
01:34:18,237 --> 01:34:19,738
Ian Gray.

1253
01:34:19,905 --> 01:34:21,240
Nasin...

1254
01:34:21,699 --> 01:34:23,576
No way this is true.

1255
01:34:23,742 --> 01:34:25,035
Aasin...

1256
01:34:27,496 --> 01:34:28,914
Afterlife.

1257
01:34:30,416 --> 01:34:31,417
Okay.

1258
01:34:31,709 --> 01:34:33,836
Let's start. You ready?

1259
01:34:34,003 --> 01:34:35,880
Yes. Yes? Okay.

1260
01:34:38,757 --> 01:34:39,925
Here we go.

1261
01:34:47,766 --> 01:34:49,059
Alpha.

1262
01:34:49,727 --> 01:34:50,895
Correct.

1263
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:06,118
Beta, correct.

1264
01:35:17,213 --> 01:35:18,422
Charlie...

1265
01:35:19,715 --> 01:35:20,716
correct.

1266
01:35:30,643 --> 01:35:31,977
Delta...

1267
01:35:32,144 --> 01:35:34,813
incorrect,
but it's not a good one.

1268
01:35:40,319 --> 01:35:42,446
Echo, incorrect.

1269
01:35:43,656 --> 01:35:44,657
Sort of.

1270
01:35:46,075 --> 01:35:47,076
Okay.

1271
01:35:54,917 --> 01:35:57,253
Foxtrot, incorrect.

1272
01:36:03,008 --> 01:36:05,511
Gamma, incorrect.

1273
01:36:07,137 --> 01:36:09,682
Howie, incorrect.

1274
01:36:13,978 --> 01:36:16,188
India, correct.

1275
01:36:17,690 --> 01:36:19,108
Joker, incorrect.

1276
01:36:19,358 --> 01:36:20,526
Kimo, incorrect.

1277
01:36:20,693 --> 01:36:23,529
Love, correct.

1278
01:36:26,448 --> 01:36:27,449
Incorrect.

1279
01:36:27,616 --> 01:36:28,617
Incorrect.

1280
01:36:29,493 --> 01:36:31,453
Universe, correct.

1281
01:36:33,163 --> 01:36:34,999
Vito, incorrect.

1282
01:36:35,541 --> 01:36:37,543
Wendy, incorrect.

1283
01:36:41,714 --> 01:36:43,382
X-ray, incorrect.

1284
01:37:24,089 --> 01:37:25,090
Yoga...

1285
01:37:27,384 --> 01:37:28,594
correct.

1286
01:37:33,682 --> 01:37:34,683
Okay.

1287
01:37:47,071 --> 01:37:48,447
What's the tally?

1288
01:37:50,115 --> 01:37:51,784
44 percent.

1289
01:37:52,785 --> 01:37:55,954
Which is, um,
a touch above random...

1290
01:37:56,121 --> 01:38:00,125
by an unfortunately
standard margin.

1291
01:38:07,716 --> 01:38:09,301
How do you feel?

1292
01:38:13,972 --> 01:38:15,641
I think numbers don't lie.

1293
01:38:15,808 --> 01:38:18,644
I didn't ask what you think,
I asked what you feel.

1294
01:38:20,813 --> 01:38:22,147
I feel...

1295
01:38:24,983 --> 01:38:26,318
kind of foolish.

1296
01:38:32,282 --> 01:38:33,659
I'll see you soon.

1297
01:38:34,993 --> 01:38:36,161
Okay.

1298
01:38:43,293 --> 01:38:46,004
I make bad test?

1299
01:38:47,589 --> 01:38:48,715
What?

1300
01:38:48,799 --> 01:38:50,342
I made bad test?

1301
01:38:51,176 --> 01:38:53,679
No. No, you did fine.

1302
01:38:54,513 --> 01:38:55,597
You did perfect.

1303
01:38:56,181 --> 01:38:59,351
It's just a stupid test.

1304
01:39:54,907 --> 01:39:58,911
Red wine.

1305
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:03,332
And sleeping pills.

1306
01:40:04,082 --> 01:40:09,254
Help me get back to your arms.

1307
01:40:13,091 --> 01:40:17,012
Cheap sex.

1308
01:40:17,721 --> 01:40:21,225
And sad films.

1309
01:40:22,184 --> 01:40:27,898
Help me get back where I belong

1310
01:40:30,442 --> 01:40:35,864
I think you're crazy.

1311
01:40:36,823 --> 01:40:40,160
Maybe

1312
01:40:40,244 --> 01:40:45,332
I think you're crazy.

1313
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:50,837
Maybe.

1314
01:40:54,299 --> 01:41:01,306
Stop sending letters.

1315
01:41:03,559 --> 01:41:09,022
Letters always get burned.

1316
01:41:12,526 --> 01:41:19,491
It's not like the movies.

1317
01:41:21,660 --> 01:41:28,667
They fed us on little white lies

1318
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:35,424
I think you're crazy.

1319
01:41:36,633 --> 01:41:39,720
Maybe

1320
01:41:39,803 --> 01:41:44,766
I think you're crazy.

1321
01:41:46,018 --> 01:41:50,022
Maybe

1322
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:55,861
I will see you.

1323
01:41:56,695 --> 01:42:02,534
In the next life...

1324
01:46:39,978 --> 01:46:42,480
Give me an update
on the archivist images.

1325
01:46:42,647 --> 01:46:45,817
We've collected hundreds of
images at high enough resolution.

1326
01:46:49,279 --> 01:46:51,907
Just waiting
on your approval to scan.

1327
01:46:54,492 --> 01:46:56,494
No time like the present.
