...and I'd sign
their credits.

136
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:55,321
Anyway, this is just
one step in a very,
very long process.

137
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,157
This is a rough
estimation...

138
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:02,244
...but let's just say
that the human eye has
12 working parts, right?

...using single mutations...

142
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:14,214
we can map out the most
logical progression...

143
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,258
...of the most
basic eye...

144
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,636
...to the most complex,
fully formed human eye.

KAREN:
I don't understand,
why take the time?

it's not a fact.

When you're
no longer a first year,

important facts are.

150
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,526
Right.

151
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,491
Each of these animals
has an eye

152
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,993
that's best selected
for its environment.

153
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,830
It would be cleaner...

154
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:50,376
...less variables,
if you had an origin.

155
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,295
Go on.

156
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,214
You start with one...

157
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:59,134
...to get to 12.
But what if you had zero?

158
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:04,139
A non-seeing organism
and built genetically
an eye from scratch...

159
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,058
...a zero to 12.

160
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,061
It'd be a perfect proof,
unassailable.

161
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,898
Non-seeing organisms
don't have the PAX6 gene.

I don't believe in luck.

510
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:38,511
I do believe
we've known each other

Yeah. You know how?

513
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,228
When the
Big Bang happened...

514
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,604
...all the atoms
in the universe

515
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,064
were all smashed together...

516
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,900
...into one little dot
that exploded outward.

517
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:56,737
So my atoms and
your atoms were
certainly together then...

518
00:35:56,905 --> 00:36:00,157
...and, who knows,
probably smashed together
several times...

519
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:03,285
...in the last
13.7 billion years.

520
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:06,539
So my atoms have
known your atoms...

521
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:10,000
...and they've always
known your atoms.

522
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,712
My atoms have always
loved your atoms.

We're not

If you're interested,
we're modifying organisms.

562

In this case,
they happen to be worms
that are blind...

...and we're
modifying them

Sofi, I believe in proof.

571
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:26,697
There is no proof
that there is some
magical spirit...

Why?

577
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:41,754
So...

578
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,049
...they live without
any ability to see

579
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,593
or even know
about light, right?

580
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:53,057
The notion of light
to them is unimaginable.

00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,225

that light exists.

...they can't sense it.

587
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:16,080
But with a little mutation,
they do. Right?

588
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,372
Correct.

KAREN: What if we just
start at the beginning
and break it down?

960
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:54,737
(PILLS RATTLE)
In the hospital,
Tobias' eyes come up

961
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:56,321
as a match with
Paul Edgar Dairy...

962
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:57,698
...which is not correct

963
01:07:57,782 --> 01:07:59,241
because Tobias
has blue eyes...

964
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:00,951
...and Paul Edgar Dairy
has brown eyes.

965
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:04,121
Uh, no, iris biometrics
is not based on color.

966
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:05,914
It's based on
the unique crypts,

967
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:07,791
furrows and shapes
in the texture.

968
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:11,170
So, maybe Tobias and Paul
have the same iris pattern.
(IAN CLEARS THROAT)

Statistically impossible.

KAREN: Second data point...

971
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:17,384
...Tobias and Paul
have some kind
of connection.

972
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:19,636
It's not our test,
so we don't know.

973
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:21,764
And the third
data point is that...

974
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:25,601
...Paul Edgar Dairy dies
before Tobias is born.

975
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:27,394
Was conceived.

976
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:31,106
Was conceived.
Because Tobias
was born in July...

977
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:34,610
...and Paul Edgar Dairy
dies in September 2012.

all their data

...and check when and where
it was registered.

1010

Well, check this out.

have the same

let's just say.

Mmm.
And there's some
sort of connection.

So the next logical step
in our scientific
inquiry is...
