00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,823
这星球上的每个人
Every living person on this planet

3
00:00:57,825 --> 00:01:02,061
都拥有独一无二的双眼
has their own unique pair of eyes,

4
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:03,829
每双眼睛自成一个宇宙
each their own universe.

5
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:19,711
我是伊恩·格雷博士
My name is Dr. Ian Gray.

6
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:22,614
我是一位父亲
I'm a father,

7
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,750
一位丈夫
a husband

8
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,152
也是一名科学家
and I'm a scientist.

9
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:37,196
当我还是孩子时就发现
When I was a child I realized that the camera

10
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:40,866
相机的原理与人眼相同
was designed exactly like the human eye,

11
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:42,234
光线从镜头中穿过
taking in light through a lens,

12
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:45,471
再被转化为图像
forming it into images.

13
00:01:45,473 --> 00:01:47,739
我开始尽可能多地
I began taking as many pictures of eyes

14
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,541
用相机记录他人的双眼
as I possibly could.

15
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,864
我想为你们讲述一个故事
I'd like to tell you the story

16
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:14,500
有一双眼睛 改变了我的世界
of the eyes that changed my world.

17
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:16,602
请记住这双眼睛
Remember these eyes.

18
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:19,638
记住眼睛中的每一处细节
Remember all the details in these eyes.

19
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,409
好了
Okay.

20
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:35,854
在故事的开头 我还是一名26岁的博士在读生
It started when I was a 26-year-old PhD student

21
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:37,422
在纽约生活
living in New York.

22
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:40,626
那是八年前的万圣夜
It was Halloween,eight years ago.

23
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,698
你还好吧
You okay?

24
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,304
我在赏月
I'm watching the moon.

25
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,915
能给你的眼睛拍张照吗
Can I take a picture of your eyes?

26
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,951
为什么
Why?

27
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,555
个人爱好
It's just something I do.

28
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,761
好吧
Okay.

29
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,730
相机被我改良过了
I've perfected this.

30
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,658
嗨
Hi.

31
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,726
嗨
Hi.

32
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:25,530
你知道雉的故事吗
Do you know the story of the Phasianidae?

33
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,266
不知道
No.

34
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:28,567
那是什么
What's that?

35
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,402
那是种鸟
It's a bird...

36
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:33,905
它能在眨眼间感受全部的时间
that experiences all of time in one instant.

37
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:37,442
它能同时歌唱爱和愤怒
And she sings the song of love and anger

38
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,611
恐惧与快乐
and fear and joy and sadness

39
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,947
还有悲伤
all at once...

40
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,717
所有的感情都会化作一种美妙的声音
all combined into one magnificent sound.

41
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,452
你是何方神圣
Where are you from?

42
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,555
外星人
Another planet.

43
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:54,593
那种鸟的声音是什么样的
What does the bird sound like?

44
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:56,528
就像这样
It sounds like this.

45
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,563
靠近点
Lean closer.

46
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,502
老天
Geez...

47
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,037
更像是噪音
It's more like noise.

48
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,005
是啊
Yeah.

49
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,545
当这种鸟
And this bird...

50
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:16,915
遇见它此生所爱的时候
when she meets the love of her life,

51
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:20,585
它会快乐 也会难过
is both happy and sad.

52
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:24,990
快乐是因为另一半的幸福才刚刚刚开始
Happy because she sees that,for him, it is the beginning,

53
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:29,361
难过是因为这幸福于它在眨眼间已然结束
and sad because she knows it is already over.

54
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:44,076
嘿 你想喝点什么吗
Hey, hey, do you want to get a drink?

55
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:45,744
不喝
I don't drink.

56
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:50,982
什么都不喝吗
Like, anything?

57
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,698
你明早醒来后不会后悔吧
You're not gonna regret this in the morning, right?

58
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,961
身份已确认
Your identity confirmed.

59
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:53,705
那个DNA转录因子项目 我做完了
I finished that transcription factor program.

60
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,810
昨晚做的？
Last night?

61
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,645
不是
No.

62
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,147
今早做的
This morning.

63
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,650
我干事可麻利了 小贱人
'Cause, bitch, I don't play.

64
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,052
这是录入基因  然后
Got the input genes, and then you put

65
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:08,220
你把转录因子... - 等等
your transcription factor... - Wait a minute.

66
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:10,889
你身上都是伏特加味
You stink of vodka.

67
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,624
我是说 这味道很难闻
I mean, like, bad. Like, it smells...

68
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,793
我知道 我知道我浑身酒臭味
Yeah, I know, I know I reek off vodka.

69
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:16,228
别那么大声说话
Stop talking so loud.

70
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,096
我把你全部的数据
Okay, I consolidated all your data

71
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,798
都整合进一个数据库了
into one database.

72
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,199
不用谢
You are welcome.

73
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,068
你太厉害了 我讨厌你
You're amazing.I hate you.

74
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,237
我爱你才帮你整理的
Well, I love you--that's why I do it.

75
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:26,505
对了
Oh, hey.

76
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:29,174
有个新的轮换学生给你带
You got a new rotating student.

77
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,642
一年级的
It's a first-year.

78
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,644
我了个...
Oh, sh...

79
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:35,947
好好当个保姆吧 伙计
Have fun babysitting, buddy.

80
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,516
你该嚼口香糖了
You need gum.

81
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:41,119
你该带孩子去了
You need to have fun babysitting.

82
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:44,122
凯伦 - 嗨 我是伊恩
Karen. - Hi. Ian.

83
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,824
稍等
Can I...?

84
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,234
跟我来
Follow me.

85
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,105
你正在尝试
You're attempting to make

86
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:02,674
让色盲老鼠分辨颜色？ - 最初的设想是这样
color-blind mice see color? - That's the idea.

87
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,676
不过在失败试验 编号...
But after failed experiment

88
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:06,945
352之后
352...

89
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:08,146
也许吧
we'll see.

104
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,314
为什么
Why?

90
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:10,949
什么为什么
Why what?

91
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,285
为什么这么多实验都失败吗
Do so many experiments fail?

92
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:17,055
为什么你想让色盲老鼠分辨颜色呢
Why are you interested in making color-blind mice see color?

93
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,325
为什么不呢
Why not?

94
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:23,295
你怎么确定它们能不能分辨颜色
How are you testing that they see color?

95
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,798
作为新来的实验室轮换助手
As the new rotating lab assistant,

96
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,968
你的工作就是
your job will be to do very boring,

97
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,037
做些无聊又重复的实验
very repetitive experiments,

98
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,706
说好听些还能算个笔记员
be a glorified note taker,

99
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,841
以及不要不停问我『为什么』
and not ask me "why" every five minutes.

100
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:37,976
好吗
Okay?

101
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,177
很好
Cool.

102
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,046
开始实验...
Commencing experiment...

103
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:43,715
编号353

response to photopigment protein in Mus musculus.

105
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:49,220
对照组对象 B 贝塔的B
The control subjects B Beta

灵魂睡眠的P
Psychopannychia.

110
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,630
那词什么意思
I don't know what that means.

111
00:09:58,632 --> 00:09:59,631
你可以查字典
Look it up.

112
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:00,799
感谢上帝的G
"G" as in goodness gracious,

113
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:03,301
拜托帮帮忙的H
"H" as in help me, please,

114
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,003
《祖兰德》的Z
"Z" as in Zoolander,

115
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,938
对照组对象为
are the mice muted

116
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,675
抑制光色素蛋白后的小鼠
with the photopigment protein.

117
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,177
当线条开始移动时
When we animate the lines...

118
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:14,112
色盲的小鼠
color-blind mice

119
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,315
会凝视前方
stare straight.

120
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,317
然后
Whereas...

121
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:22,253
祝我们好运吧
fingers crossed...

122
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:24,823
被抑制的小鼠
the muted mice..

123
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:30,028
视线会跟随线条移动
...track the lines with their eyes.

124
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,963
我的天 - 我的天啊
Holy shit. - Holy fucking shit.

125
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,832
这是在PAX6基因
Is this on the background

126
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:36,134
超表达的情况下发生的吗
of PAX6 overexpression?

127
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,738
你真是一年级生？
You're a first-year?

128
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,707
我知道了 你觉得一年级生什么都不懂
I know-- it's surprising I can put together a sentence.

129
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:45,877
抱歉 不过我之前那三个实验助手
Sorry, I... I asked my last three lab assistants

130
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,313
都让我直接给了学分送走了
not to come in and I'd sign their credits.

131
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:51,683
不管怎么说 这只是第一步
Anyway,this is just one step

132
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:55,320
后面还有很长很长的路要走
in a very, very long... process.

133
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:58,156
这只是个粗略的估计
This is a rough estimation,

134
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,191
人类的眼睛
but let's just say that the human eye

135
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,260
由12个重要部分组成
has 12 working parts, right?

136
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,095
而构造最简单的眼睛只含有一个部分
Simplest eye having one.

137
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,231
如果我们能通过单基因突变
So if we can fill in the gaps--

138
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,332
补全这之间的断层
the evolutionary gaps--

139
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,835
这之间的进化断层
using single mutations,

140
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:14,039
我们就可以描绘出
we can map out the most logical progression

141
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,274
构造最简单的眼睛
of the most basic eye...

142
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:20,278
向最复杂完备的人眼的演变过程
to the most complex, fully formed human eye.

143
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,914
我不明白 为什么要花时间做这件事
I don't understand--why take the time?

144
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,916
我们都知道眼睛是会进化的
We know that it evolved.

145
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:27,686
这只是个假设 还不是事实
It's an assumption;it's not a fact.

146
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:31,322
当你不再是一年级生的时候 你就会明白
When you're no longer a first-year, you'll see

147
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,091
事实的重要性
how important facts are.

148
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,793
好吧
Right.

149
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:40,331
这里的每一种动物
Each of these animals has an eye

150
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,001
都拥有最适应其生存环境的眼睛
that's best selected for its environment.

151
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,071
如果
It would be...

152
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,006
你能找到一个起源点的话
cleaner-- less variables--

153
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:50,408
就能排除更多不确定因素
if you had an origin.

154
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,178
继续
Go on.

155
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,246
你现在的起点是一
You start with one...

156
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:56,748
最后到达十二
to get to 12.

157
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,017
但如果存在零呢
But what if you had zero--

158
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,252
一个非视觉性组织
a non-seeing organism--

159
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:04,322
但拥有能演变为一只眼睛的基因构成
and built, genetically,an eye from scratch,

160
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,157
一个能演变成十二的零点
a zero to 12?

161
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,127
这个理论成立的证明 无懈可击
It'd be a perfect proof, unassailable.

162
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:12,997
非视觉性组织里不存在PAX6基因
Non-seeing organisms don't have the PAX6 gene.

163
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:16,167
你怎么知道 有人研究过所有的组织吗
How do you know? Has anyone ever checked all of them?

164
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:19,738
我不认为有人...
I don't think anyone has ever checked...

165
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,272
这么做过
all of them.

166
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,843
你之前就想到这点了
You've thought of this before?

167
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,378
那你为什么要惊讶
Why did you look surprised?

168
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,781
因为你也想到了
Because so have you.

169
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,453
好吧
Okay.

170
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,294
那群女孩是谁
Who were those girls?

171
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:47,365
哪群女孩？ - 万圣节派对上的
Which girls? - The ones at the Halloween party

172
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,400
都穿着SM行头
in the S&M outfits.

173
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,236
SM行头？
S&M outfits?

174
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,538
我遇到了其中一个女孩 但是不知道她的名字
I-I met one of them;I don't know her name.

175
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,508
我也没看见她的脸 但她的眼睛太美了
I don't know her face, but she had these most amazing eyes.

176
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,910
太特别了
So specific.

177
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,178
中心虹膜异色
Central heterochromia.

178
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,514
你提醒我了
Oh, reminds me.

179
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:04,382
猜我做了什么
Guess what I did.

180
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:05,850
什么
What?

181
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,919
我想到了
I figured out an improved

182
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,220
一种改良技术
implementation technique

183
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:12,357
来实践道格曼的生物测定学算法
for Daugman's biometrics algo.

184
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:14,459
你有没有过这种感觉 当你遇上某个
You ever feel like when you met someone,

185
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,060
填上了你心里一块空缺的人
they fill this hole inside of you,

186
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,362
在他们离开后
and then when they're gone...

187
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:21,299
你感觉身体变得空荡荡的
you feel that space painfully vacant?

188
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,269
你还好吧
Are you okay, man?

189
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,173
我很好啊
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

190
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:29,407
你还好吧
Are you okay?

191
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,576
你刚刚说什么 你刚才...
What did you just say? Did you just...

192
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:33,578
说话的方式 就像个诗人
The way you talked was,like, poetic.

193
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,880
太诡异了 - 你闭嘴
It was weird. - Shut the fuck up.

194
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:38,016
太诡异了 老兄 你居然也会...
So weird, dude, I can't believe...

195
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,851
糟了
Oh, shit.

196
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,389
这家伙的身体也空荡荡的
This guy is painfully vacant.

197
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,391
伊恩 瞧啊 他的身体也空...
Ian, look at him-- he's so painfully va...

198
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:49,994
他的身体也空荡荡了
He's so painfully vacant.

199
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,197
走开
Fuck off.

200
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,072
我要一包Verdict香烟
Can I get a pack of Verdict

201
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,241
再买一张威力球彩票
and a Powerball?

202
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:08,112
多少钱
How much is that?

203
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:11,983
十一块十一
$11.11.

204
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,184
十一
Eleven...

205
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,360
幸运十一号
Lucky elevens.

206
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,299
谢谢
Thanks.

207
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:12,196
凯伦
Karen.

208
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,198
你在做什么
What are you doing?

209
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,667
没有视觉的动物占物种总数的5%
Five percent of all animals don't have vision,

210
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,037
而世界上共有870万个物种
and there are 8.7 million species.

211
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,773
我把PAX6基因列导入数据库检索
So I blasted PAX6 at the database,

212
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:23,508
什么都没有发现
but nothing came up.

213
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,143
所以我开始手动测序DNA了
So I started sequencing by myself.

214
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,245
你测了多少种生物
How many did you sequence?

215
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,816
十二种 - 你已经测了十二种
12. - You've done 12.

216
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:35,219
那还剩下多少种呢
So how many do you have left?

217
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:39,323
大约四十二万六千种吧
Like, approximately 426,000.

218
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:43,628
你打算把那四十二万六千个名字
Are you going to write 426,000 names

219
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,396
都写在窗户上吗
on the window?

220
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,835
我会在窗户写满前找到结果的
I'm going to find it before I get to the end of the window.

221
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:52,203
好吧
Okay.

222
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:54,172
你在做什么
What are you doing?

223
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,542
我...什么都没做
I'm... I'm not doing anything.

224
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:50,695
我们可能永远也发现不了什么
You know we could be looking forever and find nothing.

225
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:55,399
寻找后一无所获也算一种发现
Turning over rocks and finding nothing is progress.

226
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,059
你现在能告诉我你从哪里来了么
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,996’
太多地方了 不好说
So, are you gonna tell me where you're from?
264
So many places, I don't know.

227
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:42,500
哪些地方
Which places?

228
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:48,673
简单来说 我在阿根廷出生
To make it short,I was born in Argentina,

229
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:52,510
11岁那年 我跟祖母一起搬到了法国
and when I was 11, I moved to France with my grandmother.

230
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:59,383
你的父母呢
And your parents?

231
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,420
下一个问题
Next.

232
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:09,026
你做什么工作
So, what do you do?

233
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:10,461
下一个问题
Next.

234
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:19,337
你那天为什么要和我上床
Why did you sleep with me that night?

235
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,873
判断失误
Poor judgment.

236
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,713
我寂寞了很久
I was lonely for a long time, and...

237
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,684
那天晚上我看到你时
...when I saw you that night,

238
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:37,555
感觉我们似曾相识
I had the feeling that I had known you.

239
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:40,958
事实上 我觉得你认识我
Actually, I felt like you knew me.

240
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,428
什么意思
What do you mean?

241
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,599
就像我们前世有过交集
Like we are connected from past lives.

242
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:52,069
我不相信这个
I don't believe in that.

243
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:56,774
那你相信什么
What do you believe in?

244
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:59,443
我是科学家 我相信数据
I'm a scientist;I believe in data.

245
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:00,878
科学家
A scientist?

246
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,480
哪种科学家
What kind of scientist?

247
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:03,781
分子生物学
Molecular biology.

248
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:06,517
我对眼睛最感兴趣
I'm most fascinated with the eye.

249
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,985
眼睛 这种眼睛吗
The eye...the eyes?

250
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,120
就是眼睛 - 为什么是眼睛
The eyes. - Why the eye?

251
00:23:09,122 --> 00:23:10,788
眼睛
The eye is

252
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,790
是信仰宗教的人
the one sticking point that religious people use

253
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:15,059
拒绝承认进化论的根据
to discredit evolution.

254
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:18,129
他们把眼睛看作智慧的造物者存在的证明
They use it as proof of a intelligent designer.

255
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:19,964
造物者？
Intelligent designer?

256
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:21,732
就是上帝
God.

257
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:25,436
我打算用清晰 彻底的事实
I'm looking to end the debate once and for all with...

258
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,474
来终结这场争论
...clear, clean facts.

259
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:32,610
也就是眼睛每个进化阶段的数据
Data points of every stage of eye evolution.

260
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:36,614
你为什么要努力去证明上帝是不存在的呢
Why are you working so hard to disprove God?

261
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:39,784
证明？又有谁证明过上帝是存在的吗？
Disprove? Who proved that God was there in the first place?

262
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:45,489
总之 我想先拿到
Anyway,let's get some real

263
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:47,124
关于你的数据 可以吗
data points on you, okay?

264
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:48,559
请便
Be my guest.

265
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:51,195
我也更喜欢说关于自己的事
I prefer talking about myself anyways.

266
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:53,097
好吧
Okay.

267
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:55,966
你最喜欢的...
Um, what's your favorite,

268
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:58,436
糖果？
Candy?

269
00:23:58,438 --> 00:23:59,637
草莓曼妥斯
Strawberry Mentos.

270
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:01,739
喜欢的食物？
Food?

271
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:03,707
蔬菜玉米卷
Veggie burritos.

272
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:05,075
先说一声 我是素食主义者
I'm vegetarian,you should know that.

273
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:09,046
你最喜欢哪种花
What's your favorite flower?

274
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:11,115
蒲公英
Dandelions.

275
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:13,050
为什么
Okay. Why?

276
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:16,220
因为它们在野外自由生长
'Cause, they're free, wild,

277
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:18,656
不会被放在花店里出售
and you can't buy them.

278
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:21,192
你喜欢哪门学科？
What's your favorite field of study?

279
00:24:21,194 --> 00:24:22,760
星象学
The stars.

280
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:24,628
最喜欢的动物
What's your favorite animal?

281
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,996
白孔雀
The white peacock.

282
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,965
你见过白孔雀吗
You ever see one?

283
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,467
没有
No.

284
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:30,801
纽约有一只
There's one in New York.

285
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:33,237
我带你去看
I'll take you to see it.

286
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:36,540
所以我们还会见面？
So, you're gonna see me again?

287
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:38,008
也许吧
Maybe.

288
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:51,789
在印度神话中
You know,in Indian mythology,

289
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:53,724
白孔雀象征着
the white peacock symbolizes

290
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:56,760
散落在世上的灵魂
souls being dispersed throughout the world.

291
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:59,196
你有没想过 它可能只意味着
Did you ever think it just symbolizes

292
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:02,132
细胞中缺乏色素的孔雀
a lack of melanin or pigment in the cells?

293
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,704
对照组对象 T
The control subjects "T..."

294
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:09,106
海啸的T
"T" as in tsunami.

295
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:10,574
G是...

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,209
我看见了很多个11 到处都是

302
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:46,911
太多11了
Too many elevens.

303
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:50,281
数量多到难以置信
The amount was so staggering, so unlikely,

304
00:25:50,283 --> 00:25:53,150
于是我就沿着数字向前走
that I followed them.

305
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,619
数字带我找到了你的眼睛
And when I followed them,I found your eyes,

306
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:58,055
然后带我找到了你
which then led me to you.

307
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,291
我通过你的眼睛找到了你
Because I found you through your eyes.

308
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:03,060
难以置信
Also unlikely...

309
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,162
像生命本身一样神奇

312
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,770
怎么可能
Bullshit.

313
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,842
你明白的
You know you have it.

314
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:20,811
明白什么 - 但是你害怕它
Have what? - But you're scared of it.

315
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,249
什么东西
I have what?

316
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,358
好吧
Okay.

317
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,031
你住在这个房间里 对吧
You live in this room, right?

318
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,134
这房间代表现实
Reality.

319
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:47,805
你有一张床 你有书
You have a bed, you have books,

320
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:51,675
还有一张桌子 椅子 台灯

321
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:54,144
逻辑
Logic.

322
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:55,980
但这房间
But in this room,

323
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:58,716
同时也有一扇门
you have a door...

366
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:00,050
通往另一侧
to the other side.

324
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,988
看到没
See?

325
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,358
光可以照进来
Light comes through.

326
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,259
门是开着的
It's open

327
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:14,231
虽然只是很窄一条缝 但门是开着的
just a tiny bit,but it is open.

328
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:18,202
你因为害怕所以一直试图关上那扇门
You keep trying to close that door because you're scared.

329
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:23,140
但你不会永远害怕
But you won't always be scared.

330
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,345
门后面有什么
What's behind the door?

331
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:30,214
除了我的脏衣服之外
Besides my dirty laundry.

332
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:32,216
你要走到另一边才能知道
You have to go in to find out.

333
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,953
你明白我的意思
You know what I'm talking about.

334
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,292
我不明白
I have no idea.

335
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:44,795
你会明白的
You will.

336
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:46,764
你会的
You will.

337
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:52,136
想要搬到我那里住吗
You want to move to my place?

338
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:53,671
你也有住的地方？
You have a place?

339
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:56,006
当然了
Of course.

340
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,676
明天就搬可以吗
Can I move in tomorrow?

341
00:28:33,468 --> 00:28:34,535
这是你家人吗
Is this your family?

342
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:37,114
嗯 这是我的祖母
Yes, it's my grandmother.

343
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,151
她有种奇特的美
Such an eccentric beauty.

344
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:44,221
然后
And...

345
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,893
这是我父母和小时候的我
...my parents and me when I was a baby.

346
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,997
白孔雀
Um, the white peacock.

347
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:56,867
你已经见过了
But you have met him before.

348
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:02,306
这是灵魂存在的证明
This is a proof of the spirit world.

349
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:04,341
『重生天使』
"El Ángel de la Resurreccion."

350
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:06,009
什么
What?

351
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:08,345
这座雕像的名字
It's the name of the statue,of the statue

352
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:10,080
圣安妮公墓的一尊雕像
in St. Anne's Cemetery.

353
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,315
圣安妮公墓里的雕像？
It's in St. Anne's Cemetery?

354
00:29:12,852 --> 00:29:15,152
看他的眼睛
But look at the eyes.

355
00:29:15,154 --> 00:29:17,821
这双眼睛是有生命的
They're alive.

356
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:19,423
是啊
Yeah.

357
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,825
现在什么照片都能用电脑做出来
It's amazing what you can do on Photoshop these days.

358
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:24,061
这不是电脑做的
There's no Photoshop!

359
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:29,066
眼睛是在她拍下照片时浮现出来的
The eyes appeared just when she took the picture.

360
00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:30,334
就在...
Just...

361
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:32,770
你真美
You're so beautiful.

362
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:34,204
去把盒子搬进来

妊娠期第19天

365
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:50,120
名誉 研究经费

366
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:53,791
还有财富 都在未来等着你
fortune await you.

367
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:56,493
如果你找到PAX6基因
If you find that PAX6 gene,

368
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:58,896
那些东西离我们也不远了
we'll be well on our way to all of that.

369
00:29:58,898 --> 00:30:02,533
知名度这种事让我觉得恶心
Recognition makes me extremely nauseous.

370
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,971
但让人们了解研究成果是很重要的
Well, it is important that people know about the work.

371
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:12,810
对我来说 做实验室里的小白鼠 最好的一点...
To me, the best thing about living like a lab rat...

372
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:15,946
就是有时候...
is that sometimes...

373
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:18,182
在屈指可数的几个时刻
really rare times,

374
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:21,585
当你真的发现了什么的时候
you actually discover something.

375
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:27,224
带着新发现的喜悦躺在床上的那个夜晚
On the night of a discovery,when you're lying in bed,

376
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:31,028
你就是世界上唯一掌握着全新真理的人
you are the only person in the world that knows it's true.

377
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:46,910
能答应我一件事吗
Can you promise me something?

378
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:48,545
答应你什么
Promise you something?

379
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:50,180
什么
What?

380
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,882
答应我
Promise.

381
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:53,550
你得先告诉我是什么事 我才能...
I can't promise if you don't tell me what...

382
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:55,052
先答应我
Promise first.

383
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:57,955
在你告诉我是什么事之前？
Before you tell me what it is?

384
00:30:57,957 --> 00:31:00,390
我是守信的人
I keep my promises.

385
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:02,860
不管 不答应就不说
Whatever, I won't tell.

386
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:04,628
答应我
Promise.

387
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:09,233
好吧 我答应你
Okay, I promise.

388
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:11,101
我希望你把我烧掉
I want you to burn me.

389
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:12,436
烧掉？
Burn you?

390
00:31:12,438 --> 00:31:14,504
我不想死后烂在一个箱子里
I don't want to rot in a box when I die.

391
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:16,874
噢 你是说 火化你
Oh, you mean like cremate you.

392
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:17,975
对

393
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:19,276
不行 不行
Oh, no, no.

394
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:20,878
我不想被火化
I don't want to be cremated.

395
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:27,184
我都不知道我们还有这种分歧
This is a big disagreement I didn't know we had.

396
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:29,953
火化相当于彻底抹消了存在
Cremation is like obliteration.

397
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:32,422
我是说 如果在未来 科学家们...
I mean, what if in the future,the scientists...

398
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:36,660
发现了通过DNA构造一个新的我们的方法怎么办
what if they can reconstitute ourselves through our DNA?

399
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:39,429
我要和你说清楚
I want to be clear with you.

400
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:41,198
我不想那样
I don't want that.

401
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,033
你不想做什么
You don't want what?

402
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:44,968
我不想被克伦
I don't want to be cloning.

403
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,103
克隆 克...
"Cl-Cloneed." Cl...

404
00:31:46,105 --> 00:31:47,437
『我不想被克伦』
"I don't want to be cloning."

405
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:50,374
克隆
"Cloneed."

406
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:53,343
我会先重组一个自己
No, but I'd reconstitute myself first,

407
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:55,545
然后再重组你 接着我会问你
and then I'd reconstitute you,and then I'd ask you,

408
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:57,648
『你想活下去吗』
"Do you want to be alive?"

409
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,550
如果你不想的话 我再把你杀了
And then if you didn't,I'd kill you.

410
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,226
开玩笑的 我们到时候可以永远在一起了
No, but then we could be together forever, like, like,

411
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:11,495
从科学角度说 我们真的可以被... - 你不能...
for real, scientifically. - You can't do...

412
00:32:11,497 --> 00:32:13,597
被复活 被重组
Reanimated, reconstituted.

413
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,068
你是个放不下过去的人
You have a hard time letting go.

414
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,704
别担心
Don't worry.

415
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:23,307
我们会再次找到对方的
We'll find each other again.

416
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:36,219
我喜欢你的香水
I love your smell.

417
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:37,955
是什么
What is it?

418
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:39,323
不告诉你
I won't tell.

419
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:40,457
告诉我吧
Come on, tell me.

420
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,098
嫁给我好吗
Will you marry me?

421
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:00,544
下一位
Next?

422
00:33:00,546 --> 00:33:02,045
请问要办理什么
Can I help you?

423
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:03,347
我们要结婚
We'd like to get married.

424
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:04,548
你们身份证带了吗
Do you have your I.D.'s?

425
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,516
带了
Yeah.

426
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:13,123
可以了 首先你们需要领取结婚证
Okay, first you have to get your marriage license,

427
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:14,291
这些表格需要你们填写
so you have to fill these out.

428
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:15,459
好的
Okay.

429
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:17,995
你们需要等待24小时
You're gonna have to wait 24 hours

430
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:19,529
才能成为合法夫妻
before you can actually get married.

431
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:20,697
24小时
24 hours?!

432
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:22,065
是的 - 为什么
Yeah. - Why?

433
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:23,533
这样一来 你就有24小时
Well, this way,you have 24 hours

434
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:25,502
决定你是否真的想嫁给这位年轻人
to decide whether you want to marry this young man.

435
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,270
我想嫁给他啊
But I want to marry him!

436
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:29,706
24小时后才行
In 24 hours.

437
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:32,275
所以...好吧 我知道了
So... Okay. All right. Yeah.

438
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:35,479
我们不能今天结婚了
So we can't get married today.

439
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:38,782
好吧
Okay...

440
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,153
这个规定确实...
This system really...

441
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:46,390
有点儿泼冷水的感觉 是吧
kills the spontaneity factor, huh?

442
00:33:46,392 --> 00:33:48,692
没关系 我们精神上在一起了
We're already married in the spirit world.

443
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,195
该死
Shit.

444
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,430
喂
Hello?

445
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:54,564
嗨
Hi.

446
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:55,565
嗨
Hi.

447
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:57,267
嗨
Hi.

448
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:59,536
怎么了 你打了我五通电话了
Hi. What's up? You called, like, five times.

449
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,771
是啊
I did.

450
00:34:00,773 --> 00:34:02,806
我为什么会打那么多次呢
Why would I do that?

451
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:04,808
我为什么会打五次呢
Why might I call five times?

452
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,443
我不知道
I don't know.

453
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:08,311
我今天在做电泳测试
I was running the electrophoretic drill--

454
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:10,313
就是周二的日常
you know,just another Tuesday--

455
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:12,349
然后我开始给一种
and I started sequencing the genes

456
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:16,153
叫赤子爱胜蚓的奇怪虫子做基因测序
of this strange worm called Eisenia fetida.

457
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:17,554
继续
Go on.

458
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,456
然后
And, uh...

459
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:22,292
我发现了PAX6的总开关基因
I found the PAX6 master switch.

460
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,228
不可能
No.

461
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,397
是真的 - 你是认真的吗
Yeah. - Are you serious right now?

462
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,633
你没开玩笑吧 你知道这意味着什么吗
You fucking with me? Do you know what this means?

463
00:34:29,635 --> 00:34:31,301
我们发现了原初物种
We found an origin species,

464
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:33,470
我们可以创造出眼睛了
and we can build an eye from scratch.

465
00:34:33,472 --> 00:34:36,306
我的天...！
Holy sh...!

466
00:34:38,177 --> 00:34:40,477
那个...它有没有..
Um, uh, does it...does it have

467
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:42,345
和人类相同的氨基酸序列
the same amino acid sequence as humans?

468
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:43,513
我现在...
I-I can't even...

469
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:44,815
我现在已经说不出话了
I can't even talk right now.

470
00:34:44,817 --> 00:34:46,616
我觉得我快失禁了
I feel like I'm gonna piss myself.

471
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:48,085
你能直接过来吗
Can you just come in here?

472
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:49,219
好的 我马上过去
Okay, I'm coming in right now.

473
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:50,220
你太棒了
You're amazing.

474
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:51,855
再见 先挂了
Bye. Bye-bye. Bye.

475
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,392
谁的电话
Who was that?

476
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:56,860
是凯伦...
That was Karen, uh...

477
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:58,261
我的轮换...
my rotating...

478
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:00,464
我的实验伙伴
well... my lab partner.

479
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:04,501
我现在得去实验室一趟
I have to go into the lab, right now.

480
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:07,504
你要和我一起来吗 - 今天不是我们结婚的日子吗
Do you want to come with me? - On our wedding day?

481
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,407
今天...不是
It's... well, it's not...

482
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:12,609
严格来说 今天不是我们结婚的日子
technically,it's not our wedding day today.

483
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,845
而且我们的灵魂
And we've been married forever

484
00:35:14,847 --> 00:35:17,114
不是已经永远结合了吗
in the spiritual world, right?

485
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:19,249
苏菲 求你了 跟我一起去吧
Sofi, please,come in with me.

486
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:20,450
这真的很重要
It's really important.

487
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,685
好吧
Sure.

488
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:25,622
不要紧的 我们走吧
It's fine. Let's go.

489
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,291
别难过了
Well,don'be upset about it.

490
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,160
我们把戒指戴上吧
Let's put our rings on.

491
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:31,728
不要 这会走霉运的
I don't want to;it's bad luck.

492
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,730
我不相信运气
I don't believe in luck.

493
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,200
不过我相信 我们从很久很久以前
I do believe we've known each other

494
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:40,170
就已经认识彼此了
since forever, though.

495
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:41,438
真的吗
Really?

496
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,807
是啊 知道为什么吗
Yeah.You know how?

497
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:47,410
当宇宙大爆炸发生的时候
When the big bang happened,

498
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:49,913
宇宙中的所有原子都碰撞在一起
all the atoms in the universe,they were all smashed together

499
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:52,883
变成一个小点 然后从里面迸发开来
into one little dot that exploded outward.

500
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:56,219
所以我的原子和你的原子 在那时候一定是靠在一起的
So my atoms and your atoms were certainly together then,

501
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:57,721
然后 也许...
and, who knows, probably...

502
00:35:57,723 --> 00:36:01,424
在过去的13.7亿年中
smashed together several times in the last 13.7

503
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:03,727
也碰撞过几次
billion years.

504
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:07,297
所以的原子认识你的原子
So my atoms have known your atoms...

505
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:10,400
它们长久以来都认识你的原子
and they've always known your atoms.

506
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:13,637
我的原子一直爱着你的原子
My atoms have always loved your atoms.

507
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:23,446
走吧
Let's go.

508
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,322
凯伦
Karen.

509
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:38,428
嘿 - 嗨
Hey. - Hi.

510
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,864
嗨 这位是...苏菲 这是凯伦
Hi. This is...Sofi, this is Karen.

511
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:42,532
凯伦 这是苏菲 - 嗨
Karen, this is Sofi. - Hi.

512
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,568
她是我妻子
She's my wife.

513
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:47,804
欢迎
Welcome. Um...

514
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:50,640
你想看什么
What do you want to see?

515
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:51,808
所有的东西
I want to see everything.

516
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:55,245
我现在得到了这样的胶体
So, I have this gel.

517
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:58,348
是一致的吗
And it aligns?

518
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:01,551
和PAX6蛋白的交叉比对结果
The alignment crossed PAX6 proteins...

519
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:04,221
重合度98%
98% identity.

520
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:06,456
这就是那种虫子吗
Are these the worms?

521
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,461
它们还什么都看不见呢
They can't see anything.

522
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:14,264
很快就可以了
Not for long.

523
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:35,252
我...
You know, um...

524
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:37,787
我想先回去洗个澡
I should... I'm gonna go take a shower.

525
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,923
你也已经看过了
You've seen it.

526
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:42,425
我得去洗个澡 - 洗澡？
I should take a shower - Shower?

527
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,728
再刷个牙 - 等一下 你这就走了？
brush my teeth... - Wait a minute,you're gonna go right now

528
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,630
嗯
yeah.

529
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:50,600
是啊 我觉得你可以带你妻子参观下实验室
Yeah, I'm sure you want to show your wife around the lab and...

530
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,669
好的 你确定吗
Okay. Are you sure?

531
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,539
好吧 那么...
Okay. Well, uh...

532
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:58,541
你做得很棒
this is amazing.

533
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:00,043
大发现的开始
The beginning of something...

534
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:01,745
棒极了
amazing.

535
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,417
很高兴认识你
It was nice to meet you.

536
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:10,020
你太棒了 凯伦
Amazing stuff, Karen.

537
00:38:10,022 --> 00:38:11,588
拜 - 拜
Bye. - Bye.

538
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,956
拜
Bye.

539
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:33,476
怎么了
What's wrong?

540
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,048
我知道你不高兴了
I know something's wrong, so...

541
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:41,651
你每天离开我到这里折磨这些小虫子？
You leave me every day to torture little worms?

542
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:49,359
我们没有折磨它们 苏菲
We're not torturing worms... Sofi.

543
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:51,061
如果你想知道的话
If you're interested,

544
00:38:51,063 --> 00:38:53,430
我们在改造生物
we're modifying organisms.

545
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:56,333
在这个实验中 对象碰巧是虫子
In this case,they happen to be worms,

546
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:57,867
它们看不见东西
that are blind,

547
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,602
我们正试图赋予它们视力
and we're modifying them to have vision.

548
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:03,373
你可以让没有视力的虫子看见东西？
You can make blind worms see?

549
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:04,974
差不多吧
Kind of.

550
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:07,043
我是说 现在我们应该有这个能力了
I mean, we can now, maybe.

551
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:10,547
你觉得这是个好主意吗
You think that's a good idea?

552
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:13,550
你觉得这是个坏主意吗
Do you think it's a bad idea?

553
00:39:13,552 --> 00:39:15,485
我觉得
I think...

554
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:18,054
以上帝自居是要付出代价的
it's dangerous to play God.

555
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:21,124
苏菲 我相信的是实证
Sofi, I believe in proof.

556
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:24,027
没有证据可以表明
There is no proof

557
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:27,530
世间存在某种
that there is some magical spirit...

558
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:30,367
不可见的 凌驾于我们之上的
uh, that's invisible,living above us,

559
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:31,768
神灵之力
right on top of us...

560
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,537
这些小虫有多少种感觉
How many senses do worms have?

561
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,439
两种
They have two:

562
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:37,941
嗅觉
smell...

563
00:39:37,943 --> 00:39:39,476
和触觉
and touch.

564
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:40,643
为什么问这个
Why?

565
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:42,579
那么...
So...

566
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:45,048
它们一直在没有视觉的情况下生活着
they live without any ability to see

567
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,385
更不知道光的存在 对吗
or even know about light, right?

568
00:39:48,387 --> 00:39:51,388
光线的概念之于它们
The notion of light to them is...

569
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,756
是不可想象的
unimaginable.

570
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:55,792
是的
Yeah.

571
00:39:55,794 --> 00:39:56,993
但是
But...

572
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:59,062
我们人类
we humans...

573
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:01,598
我们知道
we know...

574
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,634
光是存在的
that light exists...

575
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:06,770
它们的四周有光
all around them,

576
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:09,806
它们头顶上也有光
right on top of them.

577
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:11,975
它们感觉不到光 但
They cannot sense it, but...

578
00:40:11,977 --> 00:40:14,677
经过一些小小的变异 它们就能看见光了
with a little mutation, they do.

579
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,045
是吗
Right?

580
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:17,881
没错
Correct.

581
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,018
所以...
So...

582
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,788
眼睛博士
Dr. Eye...

583
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,790
也许某些人类
perhaps some humans--

584
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:28,491
极少数人类
rare humans--

585
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:31,995
也发生了变异 得到了一种全新的感觉
have mutated to have another sense--

586
00:40:31,997 --> 00:40:34,964
他们能感觉灵魂的存在
a spirit sense--

587
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:37,033
他们能看见
and can perceive a world

588
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:39,502
我们头顶上存在的另一个世界
that is right on top of us...

589
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:41,971
无处不在的另一个世界
everywhere...

590
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:45,942
就像光线之于这些小虫一样
just... like the light on these worms.

591
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:54,150
那么 你是变种人咯
So you're a mutant.

592
00:40:57,188 --> 00:41:00,156
不止我一个
And I'm not the only one.

593
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:19,609
老天 - 你没事吧 我看看
- Jesus! - Are you okay? Here, let me see.

594
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:22,011
福尔马林进到我眼睛里了 拿冲洗设备来
I got formaldehyde in my eye. Get the splash kit.

595
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:23,746
- 那是什么 - 该死的！
- What is it? - Aah! Fuck!

596
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:26,249
那是什么 告诉我 - 是黄色的
What is it? Tell me! - It's-it's... yellow!

597
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:27,884
就在那儿
It's right over there.

598
00:41:27,886 --> 00:41:30,687
黄色的 打电话给凯伦 快点打电话给凯伦
It's yellow. Call Karen. Fucking call Karen now.

599
00:41:30,689 --> 00:41:32,889
号码是多少！ - 就写在门边上
Where's the number! - The number's by the door.

600
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:34,824
门边上
By the door.

601
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:37,727
找到了
Got it.

602
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:49,038
我们每周五都该演练下这种情况
We should do this every Friday.

603
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,210
看一下这是几
How many fingers am I holding up?

604
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:58,081
12 - 他没瞎
12. - He's not blind.

605
00:41:58,083 --> 00:41:59,616
这是个好消息
So that's good.

606
00:41:59,618 --> 00:42:01,050
我觉得你不要紧了
I think you're gonna be fine.

607
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:02,285
你还好吧
Are you okay?

608
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:04,787
还好
Yeah.

609
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:08,091
好了
Okay.

610
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:10,527
谢谢你 - 没事
- Thank you. - Yeah.

611
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:12,529
差不多过...
You're gonna feel fine in...

612
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:14,197
12小时左右就好了
12 hours or something.

613
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,199
我明天再打电话问下情况
I'll call tomorrow and check in on him.

614
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,635
谢谢 - 不客气
Thank you. - Yeah, of course.

615
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:38,087
真有趣
This is funny.

616
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:41,758
嗯 我觉得...
Yeah. It's, um...

617
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,327
有点奇怪
...strange.

618
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,897
猜我在哪
Find me.

619
00:42:49,868 --> 00:42:51,234
诶呀
Whoa.

620
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:54,604
怎么了
Whoa what?

621
00:42:58,643 --> 00:43:00,910
我们停在两层楼中间了
We are in the middle of two floors.

622
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,645
电梯卡住了
We stopped.

623
00:43:06,952 --> 00:43:08,918
我们该给楼管打电话
We should call the super.

624
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,086
什么楼管
The super what?

625
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,155
楼管 大楼管理员
The super. The superintendent. Um,

626
00:43:12,157 --> 00:43:13,890
负责检修楼房的人
the guy that fixes the building.

627
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:15,592
你能给他打个电话吗
Can you call him?

628
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:18,795
我不认识这个人 我没有他的号码
I don't know this guy.I don't have his number.

629
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:20,797
我都忘了这回事
Of course you don't.

630
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:21,931
拿着
Here.

631
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:26,736
通讯录里的那个『楼管』
It's under "super."

632
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:28,838
怎么了
What?

633
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,873
你手机没电了
Your phone is dead.

634
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:33,343
没电了？ - 是啊
It's dead? - Yeah.

635
00:43:33,345 --> 00:43:35,878
别这样 放轻松
Now, come on, relax.

636
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,314
你真是靠不住
You're so irresponsible.

637
00:43:38,316 --> 00:43:40,917
哦
Okay...

638
00:43:48,026 --> 00:43:50,259
要我给凯伦打电话吗
Want me to call Karen?

639
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:56,666
别耍小孩子脾气
Don't be a child.

640
00:43:57,868 --> 00:44:00,937
你一直活在童话 魔法
You live in this fairy, magical...

641
00:44:00,939 --> 00:44:03,973
幻想的世界里
fantasy land.

642
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:06,209
那些都他妈是骗人的 你知道那是骗人的
It's a fucking lie,and you know it's a lie.

643
00:44:06,211 --> 00:44:07,944
你总是...
That's...

644
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:10,947
你总是想要去相信这种谎话 就像个孩子一样
it's a lie that you want to believe, like a child.

645
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:12,148
像个孩子一样
Like a child.

646
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:33,870
好了 好了
Okay. Okay.

647
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:35,438
过来
Come on.

648
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,907
我们该怎么办 - 我把你推上去
What's gonna happen? - I'll boost you up.
707
00:44:37,909 - -> 00:44:39,842
我不要 你先上去 - 来吧
No, no, no, you go first - Come on.

649
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,277
然后再拉我上去 - 苏菲 别这样
and you pull me up. - Sofi, come on...

650
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:43,112
我不要先上去 你先上去
I'm not going first. You go first.

651
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:44,814
瞧你 怕成这个样子 快来
Look at you. You're so scared. Come on.

652
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:50,086
当心
Be careful.

653
00:44:50,088 --> 00:44:51,821
你看 很容易就上来了吧
Look how easy that was.

654
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:53,089
来吧
Come on.

655
00:44:53,091 --> 00:44:55,091
来吧 上来
Come on, let's go.

656
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:58,094
上来啊 苏菲雅
Sofia, come on!

657
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:03,733
抓住我的手
Give me your hand.

658
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:07,770
抓住我的手
Give me your hand.

659
00:45:09,107 --> 00:45:10,239
好了 来吧
Okay, come on.

660
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:45,742
苏菲？
Sofi?

661
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:54,150
苏菲？苏菲？
Sofi? Sofi?

662
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:58,054
苏菲 苏菲？
Sofi? Sofi?

663
00:45:58,056 --> 00:45:59,489
苏菲？
Sofi?

664
00:46:03,128 --> 00:46:05,161
苏菲！
Sofi!

665
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,408
喂
Hello?

666
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,610
我可以过去吗
Can I come over?

667
00:48:34,612 --> 00:48:36,312
不行
No.

668
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,082
大概吧
Maybe.

669
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:41,918
如果说我这里有一样
What if I bring you something

670
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,020
会让你大吃一惊的东西呢
that I know will take your breath away.

671
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:50,593
它有眼睛了
It has an eye.

672
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:53,195
虽然还是简单的感光细胞 不过...
I mean, just light-sensitive cells, but...

673
00:48:53,197 --> 00:48:54,397
我们做到了
we did it.

674
00:48:54,399 --> 00:48:56,632
变异保留了下来
Mutations are holding.

675
00:48:57,668 --> 00:48:59,936
是你做到的
You did it.

676
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:06,509
这只是一小步 前面的路还很长
That's the first step in a really long process.

677
00:49:06,511 --> 00:49:08,511
如果你不能打起精神回到实验室工作
It's gonna end as a worm in a box

678
00:49:08,513 --> 00:49:10,947
这项发现可能会止步于盒子里的一只小虫
if you don't get your ass back in the lab.

679
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:18,354
吃点东西吧
Why don't you eat something.

680
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:08,731
他声称已经找到了
He claims to have put to rest the notion

681
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:12,501
能让人们相信眼睛并非上帝造物的证据
that the eye was made by an intelligent designer.

682
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:14,737
格雷博士 你认为单凭实验室中创造的几个变异体
Dr. Gray, you made some mutants in a laboratory,

683
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:16,839
就足以让信仰宗教的人们
and now you expect all religious people

684
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:19,408
摒弃自己的信仰吗
to what, just throw away their beliefs?

685
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,410
我认为他们会
Well, I expect them to fight me

686
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:23,112
反对我提出的每一个观点
every step of the way.

687
00:51:23,114 --> 00:51:24,613
但我恳切地希望
But I do implore them to look

688
00:51:24,615 --> 00:51:27,383
他们能够看看我们迄今为止收集的数据与证明
at the evidence and data that we've collected here.

689
00:51:27,385 --> 00:51:29,785
这些样本充分说明了
These specimens are practical examples

690
00:51:29,787 --> 00:51:32,488
眼睛每个阶段的演化过程
of every stage of eye development.

691
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:33,856
很高兴您今天能来 伊恩·格雷博士
Dr. Ian Gray,thanks for being here.

692
00:51:33,858 --> 00:51:35,257
谢谢你们的邀请
Thanks for having me.

693
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:37,860
这本书的名字是《完全之眼》
Uh, the book is The Complete Eye.

694
00:51:37,862 --> 00:51:39,562
好了
All right.

695
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:45,401
我表现如何
How'd I do?

696
00:51:45,403 --> 00:51:47,136
你干嘛做出那个表情
Why do you do that thing with your face?

697
00:51:47,138 --> 00:51:48,437
你说什...
What-what do you...?

698
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,206
你刚才就像这样 这样
That thing where you're,like...

699
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:53,275
你表情很正常 - 表现很好 很好
You did nothing with your face. - It was good,it was good.

700
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:54,643
我觉得你应该
Man, you should have joined

701
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:56,812
去私企工作 教授先生
the private sector, Professor.

702
00:51:56,814 --> 00:51:59,548
太疯狂了 虹膜识别技术
It's crazy.Iris biometrics is...

703
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:02,151
已经在世界各地流行开来了
exploding all over the world.

704
00:52:02,153 --> 00:52:04,520
我可是把爱人放在第一位的
I'll take love over money any day.

705
00:52:04,522 --> 00:52:06,755
你还真成熟呢
Wow, that's mature of you.

706
00:52:06,757 --> 00:52:09,525
你觉得他们会聘用我吗
You think I could really get a job there?

707
00:52:11,129 --> 00:52:12,862
谢谢
Thank you.

708
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:18,868
怎么了
You all right?

709
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:20,703
还需要酒水吗
Any more drinks?

710
00:52:20,705 --> 00:52:22,805
没事 我只是...
Uh, yeah, I just...

711
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:24,840
闻到了似曾相识的味道
there's a smell,I can't place it.

712
00:52:24,842 --> 00:52:27,543
可能是你的香水
Maybe it's your perfume.

713
00:52:27,545 --> 00:52:29,478
还需要酒水吗
Any more drinks?

714
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,314
不用了 我们想知道
Uh, no, actually,we'd like to know

715
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:34,316
你香水的牌子 - 不用回答这个问题
what your perfume is? - You don't have to answer that.

716
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,252
兰蔻璀璨
It's Tresor.

717
00:52:36,254 --> 00:52:37,586
璀璨？
Tresor?

718
00:52:37,588 --> 00:52:40,456
很好闻 - 谢谢
It's lovely. - Thank you.

719
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:42,892
我不介意再来一杯
I'm okay with drink.

720
00:52:42,894 --> 00:52:44,493
璀璨
It's Tresor.

721
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:45,594
这是法语词
It's French.

722
00:52:45,596 --> 00:52:46,929
你该不会...
Are you hitting on the...

723
00:52:46,931 --> 00:52:50,332
当着怀孕老婆的面勾搭女服务生吧
waitress in front of your pregnant wife?

724
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:51,901
我确定你是不是了解我 肯尼
I don't know if you know this about me, Kenny,

725
00:52:51,903 --> 00:52:54,370
我负责嫉妒的基因是 隐性的
but the gene for jealousy--recessive.

726
00:52:54,372 --> 00:52:56,205
那挺好的 对他来说
That's... that's good, for him.

727
00:52:56,207 --> 00:52:59,742
我要带着我漂亮的 怀孕的老婆去跳舞了
I'm going to the dance floor with my pregnant, lovely wife.

728
00:52:59,744 --> 00:53:01,777
我待会帮你问她的号码
I'm gonna get her number for you.

729
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:03,946
失陪啦
Please. Thank you.

730
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:08,784
我已经等不及
I'm so looking forward

731
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:11,654
要和你一起给宝宝洗脑了
to brainwashing this child with you.

732
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,658
你知道我怎么想吗
You know what I was thinking?

733
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:16,892
什么
What?

734
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:24,233
如果我们把车库改造成实验室
What if we turn the garage into a lab?

735
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:28,604
然后拿宝宝当我们的第一个实验对象
And the baby could be our first test subject.

736
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,310
真是个好主意
That's a great idea.

737
00:53:34,312 --> 00:53:36,812
从道德上讲有不对的地方吗
Is there something ethically wrong with that?

738
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:42,284
没有
No.

739
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:52,394
你知道我在想什么吗
You know what I want to do?

740
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:55,864
我们该离开这里
I think we should leave.

741
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,855
我来帮我妻子
I'm, uh, picking up a prescription

742
00:54:19,857 --> 00:54:22,391
凯伦·格雷 取药
for my wife, Karen Gray.

743
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:41,777
妈妈唱首歌给你听吧
How about if I sing to you?

744
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:47,516
美丽的梦中人
Beautiful dreamer

745
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:52,321
请为我醒来
Wake unto me...

746
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:07,336
白日的喧嚣
Sounds of the rude world

747
00:55:07,338 --> 00:55:09,438
已经过去
Heard in the day

748
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,875
银色的月光
Lull'd by the moonlight

749
00:55:12,877 --> 00:55:14,977
散发光彩
Have all pass'd away...

750
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:25,421
美丽的梦中人
Beautiful dreamer

751
00:55:25,423 --> 00:55:27,589
请为我醒来
Wake unto me

752
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:32,728
星光和露珠
Starlight and dewdrops

753
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:34,963
正为你等待
Are waiting for thee

754
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:49,345
看镜头 说你好
Say hello to the camera.

755
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,682
苏菲 快点
Sofi, come on.

756
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:56,051
温柔点
Be nice.

757
00:55:56,053 --> 00:55:58,420
温柔点 像个淑女那样
Be nice. Come on, act like a lady.

758
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:02,624
你好 - 你好
Hello.- Hello.

759
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:05,594
你好 - 我想要你
Hello. - I want you.

760
00:56:05,596 --> 00:56:07,830
我更想要你
I want you more.

761
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,014
别停下来
Don't stop.

762
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:31,854
我想看看什么东西让你这么兴奋
I want to know what's turning you on.

763
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:53,175
我之前从没这样过
I never do this.

764
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:15,431
有时我会思考那件事的前因后果是什么
I sometimes think about the cause and effect of it,

765
00:57:15,433 --> 00:57:19,034
我想 —— 我并没有觉得内疚
and I think about how-- and I don't feel guilty for this...

766
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:21,937
但是我会想
...but I think about how

767
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:25,841
如果我那天没有打电话叫你去实验室
if I hadn't called you into the lab that day...

768
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,778
她可能不会...她可能还会活着
she would...maybe still be here,

769
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,681
而你还和她在一起
and you would be with her.

770
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:38,987
跟你说一件让我觉得自己很残忍的事
Can I tell you something that makes me feel like a monster?

771
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:44,493
那天 在电梯里
That day in the elevator,

772
00:57:44,495 --> 00:57:47,496
我想 『我是不是这辈子』
I thought,"Am I going to be stuck

773
00:57:47,498 --> 00:57:50,899
『都要和这个长不大的孩子困在这里了』
with this child the rest of my life?"

774
00:57:50,901 --> 00:57:54,236
然后下一秒 她就死了
And then the next moment, she was dead.

775
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:59,875
我们不可能在一起的 凯伦
We were never gonna be...together, Karen.

776
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,911
我只是一直没有...
I just never got...

777
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:04,646
解脱出来
closure.

778
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:07,082
我一直没机会...
I never got to say...

779
00:58:07,084 --> 00:58:09,051
和她告别
good-bye.

780
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:16,725
吻我
Kiss me.

781
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:49,224
虹膜扫描技术是现在许多大医院
Iris scanning is a new identification measure taken up

782
00:58:49,226 --> 00:58:51,226
都开始采用的新型身份识别技术
by the more sophisticated hospitals.

783
00:58:51,228 --> 00:58:53,061
我们知道什么是虹膜扫描
We know what iris scanning is.

784
00:58:53,063 --> 00:58:55,731
我们的实验室已经用了有十年了
We've had it in our lab for a... for a decade.

785
00:58:55,733 --> 00:58:58,567
这对于大众来说还是项新技术
Well, it's still new to the general public.

786
00:58:58,569 --> 00:59:01,270
虽然现在法律还没有规定
Now, we are not yet legally required

787
00:59:01,272 --> 00:59:04,907
要做虹膜扫描登记 不过我们已经启用了机器
to scan eyes, but we adopted the technology

788
00:59:04,909 --> 00:59:08,277
只要父母同意就可以给孩子扫描
and use it with the parents' consent.

789
00:59:08,279 --> 00:59:10,712
我不介意 你觉得呢
I'm fine with it. Do you, uh...?

790
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:13,949
我也不介意 扫描吧 - 我先把灯关掉
Scan, yeah. Do the scan.  - I dim the lights.

791
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:18,220
扫描不会造成伤害
The system is non-obtrusive,

792
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:20,055
事实上
and in all actuality

793
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:23,992
就是给眼睛拍照而已
is just taking photo of the eyes.

794
00:59:23,994 --> 00:59:25,961
开始咯 - 躺好 托比亚斯
There you go. - Come here, Tobias.

795
00:59:25,963 --> 00:59:27,729
谢谢 - 可以了吗
Oh, thank you. - You got it?

796
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:30,766
可以了 谢谢
Yes, I got it. Thank you.

797
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:34,937
接下来 电脑会处理图像
What happens then is,the computer finds

798
00:59:34,939 --> 00:59:37,606
在眼睛的缝隙中找出许多定点
a bunch of points in the crevices of the eye...

799
00:59:37,608 --> 00:59:39,041
我们知道这个原理的
Yeah, we-we understand how it works.

800
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:50,752
噢 抱歉
Oh, forgive me.

801
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:54,122
这是新系统 能看出来吧
These systems are sort of new.Can you tell?

802
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:57,025
保罗·埃德加·戴瑞？
Paul Edgar Dairy?

803
00:59:57,027 --> 00:59:59,661
像海盗的名字
Sounds like a pirate.

804
00:59:59,663 --> 01:00:02,764
出现这种情况的时候 我就得输入操作码
If this happens,I'm supposed to punch in a key

805
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:04,866
然后重启
and reboot.

806
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:10,872
稍等
Wait.

807
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:20,916
好了
There we go.

808
01:00:20,918 --> 01:00:22,918
现在我要录入他的身份信息
So I'll just put in his info.

809
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:26,054
宝宝叫什么名字
What is his name?

810
01:00:26,056 --> 01:00:28,790
我觉得叫保罗·埃德加·戴瑞也挺好
I like Paul Edgar Dairy.It's fine.

811
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:31,093
托比亚斯·乔治·格雷
Tobias George Gray.

812
01:00:31,095 --> 01:00:33,161
和他祖父的名字一样
After his grandfather.

813
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:42,671
喂？ - 你好 是伊恩·格雷吗
Hello? - Hi. Is this Ian Gray?

814
01:00:42,673 --> 01:00:45,073
是的 - 我是西蒙斯博士
It is. - My name is Dr. Simmons.

815
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:48,076
我是耶鲁大学和格林威治医院合作机构的
I work in conjunction with Yale and the Greenwich hospital

816
01:00:48,078 --> 01:00:51,013
您妻子七月份是在那里生产的对吧
where you and your wife gave birth in July.

817
01:00:51,015 --> 01:00:53,849
是的 有什么问题吗
Yeah, yeah.Is everything okay?

818
01:00:53,851 --> 01:00:56,752
没什么问题 请不要紧张
Yes, everything's okay.Please don't be alarmed.

819
01:00:56,754 --> 01:00:58,754
不过 我们有几项简单的测试
We would, however,like to run

820
01:00:58,756 --> 01:01:01,390
想要让托比亚斯参与
a few simple tests on Tobias.

821
01:01:01,392 --> 01:01:05,293
他的检查结果显示...虽然这概率非常小
His test results may suggest, although highly unlikely,

822
01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:08,230
但他有患上早期自闭症的风险
the possibility of early autism.

823
01:01:08,232 --> 01:01:11,233
我也是内行人 什么测试
You know I'm a doctor. What test results?

824
01:01:11,235 --> 01:01:13,735
我们确定了...
We've pinpointed...

825
01:01:13,737 --> 01:01:16,304
麻烦稍等一下
Can you hold on a moment, please?

826
01:01:16,306 --> 01:01:19,274
凯伦 听电话
Karen, listen to this.

827
01:01:19,276 --> 01:01:21,109
请讲
Yeah.

828
01:01:21,111 --> 01:01:23,311
我们已经确定了一系列
We've pinpointed an array of molecular compounds

829
01:01:23,313 --> 01:01:25,013
自闭症患儿尿液中
that appear in the urine

830
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:27,149
会包含的分子化合物
of children with autism...

831
01:01:27,151 --> 01:01:29,184
而托比亚斯的样本包含了
and Tobias showcased

832
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:31,753
部分此类化合物 但我保证他患病的几率很小
a few of them.I promise it's unlikely,

833
01:01:31,755 --> 01:01:35,757
但还是应该检查一下 过程很简单
but worth checking out,and we have very simple,

834
01:01:35,759 --> 01:01:38,794
不会造成任何伤害 大概一小时内就能完成
non-obtrusive tests,and we'll be done in an hour.

835
01:01:38,796 --> 01:01:40,996
请问您的名字和所属机构是？
What was your name and affiliation?

836
01:01:40,998 --> 01:01:42,464
詹妮特·西蒙斯博士
Dr. Janet Simmons.

837
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:45,000
我与耶鲁大学和格林威治医院
I run a research lab on child autism

838
01:01:45,002 --> 01:01:47,803
合作运营一所儿童自闭症研究实验室
in conjunction with Yale and the Greenwich hospital.

839
01:01:47,805 --> 01:01:50,272
西蒙斯对吧 - 詹妮特·西蒙斯
Simmons, you said? - Janet Simmons.

840
01:01:50,274 --> 01:01:53,375
我们的诊所离斯坦福德市不远
Our clinic is in Stamford,not too far from there.

841
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:56,445
我建议还是尽早检查比较好
It's important to check this soon.

842
01:01:56,447 --> 01:01:57,979
你们...
There's...

843
01:01:57,981 --> 01:02:01,283
不用太急 但今天内能来最好
no alarming rush, but we could see him today.

844
01:02:01,285 --> 01:02:02,851
好的 谢谢 我们再联系
Okay. Thank you.You'll hear from us.

845
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:16,898
托比亚斯
Tobias.

846
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:19,401
看这里 看这里
Look here. Look here.

847
01:02:36,019 --> 01:02:38,019
我不太明白
I'm not sure I understand

848
01:02:38,021 --> 01:02:39,788
这个测试和自闭症有什么关系
how this is testing for autism.

849
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:42,891
血检和尿检可以检测出分子化合物
The blood and urine tests will check for molecular compounds.

850
01:02:42,893 --> 01:02:45,026
而通过这项感知能力测试
This test is purely perceptual,

851
01:02:45,028 --> 01:02:47,195
我们追踪孩子的眼部运动
tracking the child's eye movements

852
01:02:47,197 --> 01:02:50,031
看他们会被什么所吸引
and attractions.

853
01:04:20,457 --> 01:04:23,425
行了 可以了 - 好了 测试结束了
Okay, that's enough. - Yeah. The test is over.

854
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:35,604
如果您来电查询
If you are calling regarding

855
01:04:35,606 --> 01:04:37,172
现存的孩童资料
an existing child,

856
01:04:37,174 --> 01:04:39,608
请输入对应的七位数查询编码
please enter your seven-digit session number.

857
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:44,379
这个西蒙斯博士在研究某种东西
This Dr. Simmons is up to something.

858
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:46,581
儿童自闭症 鬼才相信
Child autism, my ass.

859
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:48,350
我一直在观察她的测试
I keep running through her studies.

860
01:04:48,352 --> 01:04:51,386
两张并排的图片 她到底在研究什么
What was she doing? Two images side by side.

861
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:53,622
两张图片 相似但又有区别
Two images,similar but different.

862
01:04:53,624 --> 01:04:55,323
托比亚斯会望向其中的一张
Tobias would look at one or the other.

863
01:04:55,325 --> 01:04:57,592
你还记得那些图片的细节吗
Do you remember anything specific about the images?

864
01:04:57,594 --> 01:05:00,028
能看出什么联系吗
Something connected to something?

865
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:02,297
有什么可以查到的吗
Something we could look up?

866
01:05:02,299 --> 01:05:05,133
我记得有一个...农场
There was a...farmhouse.

867
01:05:08,372 --> 01:05:09,938
还有...
There was, um...

868
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:12,140
爱达荷州博伊西的丹氏餐车
Dan's Diner in Boise, Idaho.

869
01:05:12,142 --> 01:05:13,642
不知道什么意思
Whatever that means.

870
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:17,579
真有这么个地方
Well, that's a real place.

871
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:43,305
你好
Hello.

872
01:05:43,307 --> 01:05:44,940
要点些什么
What can I get you?

873
01:05:44,942 --> 01:05:47,409
一杯咖啡就好
Um, just a cup of coffee.

874
01:05:47,411 --> 01:05:49,377
没问题
Sure thing.

875
01:05:55,685 --> 01:05:57,385
我是外地来的
I'm not from around here.

876
01:05:57,387 --> 01:05:59,554
我想问问 这里有没有什么地方
I was wondering, is there anything interesting

877
01:05:59,556 --> 01:06:01,256
值得参观的
in town to see?

878
01:06:01,258 --> 01:06:02,557
这块儿没什么好看的
Not much around these parts.

879
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:04,492
除非你对奶牛有兴趣
Unless you,fancy visiting some cows

880
01:06:04,494 --> 01:06:06,094
附近有个奶牛农场
down at the dairy farm.

881
01:06:06,096 --> 01:06:08,296
奶牛农场？
There's a dairy farm?

882
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:09,698
总共一美元
That'll be a dollar.

883
01:06:11,068 --> 01:06:13,335
好的
Of course.

884
01:06:13,337 --> 01:06:15,170
那个奶牛农场在什么地方
Where is the dairy farm located?

885
01:06:15,172 --> 01:06:17,238
这儿左转 开个两英里左右就能看见了
Uh, take a left,about two miles down the road.

886
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,707
很好找的
Can't miss it.

887
01:06:32,022 --> 01:06:33,254
稍等一会就好
We'll have 'em through in a moment.

888
01:06:33,256 --> 01:06:34,689
好的
Okay.

889
01:06:34,691 --> 01:06:35,690
快点
Come on!

890
01:06:39,261 --> 01:06:42,063
这里是奶牛场吗
Is this the dairy farm?

891
01:06:42,065 --> 01:06:43,999
是的
Indeed it is.

892
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:47,302
这些是奶牛吗
These are milking cows?

893
01:06:47,304 --> 01:06:48,770
这些是肉牛 不是奶牛
These are meat cows,not milking cows.

894
01:06:48,772 --> 01:06:50,338
我是茱丽·戴瑞
I'm Julie Dairy.

895
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,539
这是我们家的农场
This is my family's farm.

896
01:06:51,541 --> 01:06:54,242
茱丽·戴瑞
Julie Dairy?

897
01:06:54,244 --> 01:06:56,244
保罗·埃德加·戴瑞
Uh, Paul Edgar Dairy.

898
01:06:56,246 --> 01:06:57,545
是你的家人吗
Are you related to him?

899
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:00,682
对 他是我父亲
Yes, he's my father.

900
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,553
他在吗
Is he here?

901
01:07:05,555 --> 01:07:08,423
所以你不是和做人物采访的那些人一起的
You're clearly not with the biography association.

902
01:07:08,425 --> 01:07:09,524
不好意思
The, um, I'm sorry.

903
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:11,192
我没听明白
I don't follow.

904
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:13,762
几个月前有一群拍纪录片的人来这儿
Some documentary crew came through here a few months ago,

905
01:07:13,764 --> 01:07:16,231
说是要做一期保罗·埃德加·戴瑞的故事
wanting to do a story on the great Paul Edgar Dairy,

906
01:07:16,233 --> 01:07:18,533
博伊西唯一的黑人农场主
the only black farmer in Boise.

907
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:20,502
他们拍了些照片
They took some pictures.

908
01:07:20,504 --> 01:07:23,338
我喜欢这个故事 然后他们说还会再来的
I liked the story, and they said they'd follow up.

909
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:27,042
你没事吧？
You okay?

910
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:32,347
你好啊
How you doing there?

911
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,184
我没事
I'm okay.

912
01:07:36,186 --> 01:07:38,086
我只是突然有种...
I'm just, uh, having a moment

913
01:07:38,088 --> 01:07:39,621
即视感
of déjà vu.

914
01:07:39,623 --> 01:07:41,456
要喝点水吗
Can we fetch you some water?

915
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:43,391
或者茶
Or a cup of tea?

916
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:46,828
如果可能的话 我想见见保罗
I'd really love to meet Paul,if that was possible.

917
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:52,634
不如我们回到最开始 一步步来看
What if we just start at the beginning and break it down?

918
01:07:52,636 --> 01:07:55,437
先是在医院里 托比亚斯的眼部扫描
In the hospital,Tobias's eyes come up as a match

919
01:07:55,439 --> 01:07:57,372
和保罗·埃德加·戴瑞的结果匹配 但明显是不对的
with Paul Edgar Dairy,which is not correct,

920
01:07:57,374 --> 01:07:59,307
托比亚斯的眼睛是蓝色
because Tobias has blue eyes

921
01:07:59,309 --> 01:08:00,775
保罗·埃德加·戴瑞的是褐色
and Paul Edgar Dairy has brown eyes.

922
01:08:00,777 --> 01:08:04,145
不是这样的 虹膜识别技术不以眼睛颜色做区分
Uh, no, iris biometrics is not based on color.

923
01:08:04,147 --> 01:08:05,780
而是每双眼睛独一无二的结构
It's based on the unique crypts,

924
01:08:05,782 --> 01:08:07,749
纹路以及形状
furrows and shapes in the texture.

925
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:11,252
所以托比亚斯和保罗的虹膜结构可能是一样的
So maybe Tobias and Paul have the same iris pattern.

926
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:12,720
从统计学角度看是不可能的
Statistically impossible.

927
01:08:12,722 --> 01:08:15,090
第二个关键点
Second data point.

928
01:08:15,092 --> 01:08:17,425
托比亚斯和保罗有着某种联系
Tobias and Paul have some kind of connection.

929
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:19,627
但测试不是我们做的 所以无从得知
It's not our test,so we don't know.

930
01:08:19,629 --> 01:08:21,729
第三点就是
And the third data point is that

931
01:08:21,731 --> 01:08:25,600
保罗·埃德加·戴瑞 在托比亚斯出生前去世
Paul Edgar Dairy dies before Tobias is born.

932
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:27,569
正好是怀孕的日子
was conceived.

933
01:08:27,571 --> 01:08:31,206
正好是怀孕的日子 因为托比亚斯
Was conceived,because Tobias is born

934
01:08:31,208 --> 01:08:33,374
2013年七月出生 保罗·埃德加·戴瑞去世于
in July, and Paul Edgar Dairy dies

935
01:08:33,376 --> 01:08:35,477
2012年九月 正好...
in September 2012; that's...

936
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:36,544
正好十个月 - 我有点听不懂
...that's ten months. - Okay, what are you guys

937
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:37,879
你们俩说的话了
talking about right now?

938
01:08:37,881 --> 01:08:39,481
你们就像精神错乱了一样
You guys sound like crazy people.

939
01:08:39,483 --> 01:08:41,649
知道吗 这些联系有什么含义吗
Okay? What is this connection referencing?

940
01:08:41,651 --> 01:08:44,252
博士 - 西蒙斯博士
Doctor...- Dr. Simmons.

941
01:08:44,254 --> 01:08:45,420
耶鲁大学的
From Yale.

942
01:08:45,422 --> 01:08:47,155
她给托比亚斯做了这项测试
She did this test on Tobias.

943
01:08:47,157 --> 01:08:48,490
西蒙斯博士？
Dr. Simmons?

944
01:08:48,492 --> 01:08:49,891
耶鲁大学的？
From Yale?

945
01:08:49,893 --> 01:08:52,460
她是能够访问眼部数据库的
She's one of five people who have access

946
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:54,362
五个人之一 - 什么
to the eye database. - What?

947
01:08:54,364 --> 01:08:57,599
我的公司持有虹膜识别技术的专利
My company owns a patent on iris biometrics

948
01:08:57,601 --> 01:09:00,435
所有眼部扫描的资料都被整合进了一个数据库里
and consolidate all their data into one database.

949
01:09:00,437 --> 01:09:03,171
西蒙斯是有数据库访问权的五人之一
And Simmons is one of five people that have access.

950
01:09:03,173 --> 01:09:05,173
但你也有访问权对吧
But you have access to it, too.

951
01:09:05,175 --> 01:09:06,641
算是吧
Sort of.

952
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:08,610
我可以找到虹膜数据
I can find the iris code, okay?

953
01:09:08,612 --> 01:09:10,678
查找一个人的资料是否在系统里
Run it and see if it's in the system,

954
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,580
然后查找扫描者的IP地址
and then check the IP address

955
01:09:12,582 --> 01:09:14,349
确认他是何时何地做的眼部扫描
and check when and where it was registered.

956
01:09:14,351 --> 01:09:15,517
这是我能做的
I can do that.

957
01:09:15,519 --> 01:09:17,152
要怎么做
How do you do that?

958
01:09:17,154 --> 01:09:18,419
看这里
Look into that.

959
01:09:18,421 --> 01:09:19,888
好了 另一只眼睛
Okay, other eye.

960
01:09:21,258 --> 01:09:23,158
行了
All right.

961
01:09:24,593 --> 01:09:27,762
虽然看不到你的姓名和个人资料
So I can't get your name or biographicals,

962
01:09:27,764 --> 01:09:29,864
但我可以确认你在这个系统里
but I can see that you are in the system.

963
01:09:29,866 --> 01:09:32,300
好极了 - 是吧
Amazing. - Right?

964
01:09:32,302 --> 01:09:34,903
然后
And that...

965
01:09:34,905 --> 01:09:36,304
你的注册时间地点是
you were registered

966
01:09:36,306 --> 01:09:37,705
2005年 实验室
at the lab in 2005,

967
01:09:37,707 --> 01:09:39,807
我和凯伦应该也是这个时候注册的
and the same should be for Karen and myself.

968
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:44,512
你怎么想 凯伦
What are you thinking, Karen?

969
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:45,847
你们听我说
Well, check this out.

970
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:48,483
保罗和托比亚斯
So Paul and Tobias

971
01:09:48,485 --> 01:09:50,618
假设他们有相同的虹膜结构
have the same iris patterns,let's just say,

972
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:52,253
并且他们之间存在某种联系
and there's some sort of connection.

973
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:54,822
那么我们调查的下一步
So the next logical step in our scientific inquiry

974
01:09:54,824 --> 01:09:58,293
就应该是
is to find someone

975
01:09:58,295 --> 01:10:01,229
找到系统中另一对与我们认识的人相同的眼睛
that we do know who's a duplicate in the system.

976
01:10:01,231 --> 01:10:02,897
比如某个已经过世的家人
Like a family member who has died.

977
01:10:02,899 --> 01:10:04,632
就是这样 我们需要另一对案例
That's it. We need another match.

978
01:10:04,634 --> 01:10:07,268
你们知道这从统计学角度来看是不可能的吧
Guys, this is statistically impossible.

979
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:08,336
什么都不可能找到的
You're not gonna find anything.

980
01:10:08,338 --> 01:10:09,504
你能不能
Can you get a scan

981
01:10:09,506 --> 01:10:10,772
扫描照片上的眼睛
from a photo?

982
01:10:10,774 --> 01:10:12,640
必须是准确对焦的高清照片
It has to be high-res and in focus.

983
01:10:12,642 --> 01:10:13,942
技术上来说是可以的 但是...
Technically,I can do it, but...

984
01:10:13,944 --> 01:10:17,345
我有几百张高清照片
I have hundreds of high-res photos

985
01:10:17,347 --> 01:10:18,746
都是眼部特写 - 好吧
of people's eyes. - All right.

986
01:10:18,748 --> 01:10:19,914
你可以扫描这些
You can scan these.

987
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:22,483
把硬盘给我
Give me the hard drive.

988
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:24,919
这太荒唐了
This is ridiculous.

989
01:10:24,921 --> 01:10:26,487
要扫描谁的照片
Who do you want me to run?

990
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:28,489
先看看我爸的
Hmm, run my father.

991
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:29,924
托比亚斯·乔治·格雷
Tobias George Gray.

992
01:10:29,926 --> 01:10:31,893
好 - 他两年前过世的
All right.- He died two years ago.

993
01:10:34,797 --> 01:10:37,465
系统里有他的资料
He's in the system, and...

994
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:39,467
他注册于
and he's registered

995
01:10:39,469 --> 01:10:41,469
希思罗机场 2006年 - 好的
at Heathrow 2006. - Okay.

996
01:10:41,471 --> 01:10:42,770
应该没错
That makes sense.

997
01:10:42,772 --> 01:10:45,306
他经常去伦敦
He was traveling there frequently.

998
01:10:45,308 --> 01:10:47,609
再试试我的叔叔 巴塞尔
Try, um, my Uncle Basil.

999
01:10:48,877 --> 01:10:51,246
他七年前因为癌症去世
He died seven years ago of cancer.

1000
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:54,015
好的
All right.

1001
01:10:54,017 --> 01:10:55,450
没有找到

试试你的祖父母 - 我的祖父母
Try your grandparents. - My grandparents.

1003
01:10:56,853 --> 01:10:58,353
对 - 贝芙和巴里
Yeah. - Bev and Barry.

1004
01:10:58,355 --> 01:11:00,321
贝芙
Bev...

1005
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:03,658
她在系统里
She's in the system.

1006
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:05,860
注册于...
Registered...

1007
01:11:05,862 --> 01:11:08,696
阿姆斯特丹史基浦机场 1998年
at Schiphol Airport,Amsterdam, in 1998.

1008
01:11:08,698 --> 01:11:10,598
数据库里有多少人
How many people are in the database?

1009
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,500
大概 几亿人
There's, like, hundreds of millions.

1010
01:11:12,502 --> 01:11:14,269
很快就会破十亿了
There's a billion soon.

1011
01:11:14,271 --> 01:11:15,470
试试我的祖父母
Try my grandparents.

1012
01:11:15,472 --> 01:11:17,338
好的 - 有了
Okay. - Right there.

1013
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:18,840
朱迪在系统里
Judy is in the system.

1014
01:11:18,842 --> 01:11:22,043
注册于纽黑文的一家老人院
She was registered in a nursing home in New Haven

1015
01:11:22,045 --> 01:11:23,845
2009年 - 马尔科姆呢
in 2009. - And Malcolm?

1016
01:11:23,847 --> 01:11:25,713
马尔科姆
Malcolm...

1017
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:26,814
没找到 没有注册
Not found. Not registered.

1018
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:30,285
好了 还有谁吗
All right, so anybody else?

1019
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:34,555
苏菲
Sofi.

1020
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:40,361
好吧 查一下苏菲
Okay, try Sofi.

1021
01:11:40,363 --> 01:11:41,596
好
Okay.

1022
01:11:41,598 --> 01:11:43,865
苏菲
Sofi.

1023
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:55,777
她在系统里
She's in the system.

1024
01:11:55,779 --> 01:11:57,011
应该没错
Yeah, that makes sense.

1025
01:11:57,013 --> 01:11:58,913
她可能是在
She was probably scanned

1026
01:11:58,915 --> 01:12:00,515
过海关时做的扫描
when she came through Customs.

1027
01:12:00,517 --> 01:12:03,084
不 数据显示...
No. It says that...

1028
01:12:03,086 --> 01:12:05,920
IP地址的坐标显示 她是在...
the IP address coordinates say that she was scanned

1029
01:12:05,922 --> 01:12:08,056
印度德里的一个社区中心做的扫描
in a community center in Delhi, India.

1030
01:12:08,058 --> 01:12:10,792
她肯定去过那里
She must have traveled there.

1031
01:12:10,794 --> 01:12:12,593
三个月前？
Three months ago?

1032
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:16,964
这不可能
That doesn't make any sense.

1033
01:12:16,966 --> 01:12:18,066
肯定是弄错了
That's not right.

1034
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:24,339
一定是系统错误
It's an error.

1035
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:28,042
我们才试到第七个人
It's only the seventh one we tried.

1036
01:12:28,044 --> 01:12:30,611
我要出去透透气
I need to get some air.

1037
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:33,748
这到底是怎么回事
What the fuck is happening?

1038
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:22,697
宝宝睡着了吗
Did you put him to bed?

1039
01:13:22,699 --> 01:13:24,665
嗯
Yeah.

1040
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,108
你该去印度看看
You should go to India.

1041
01:13:39,715 --> 01:13:41,182
我不能去印度
I can't go to India.

1042
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,954
是不能还是不想
Can't or won't?

1043
01:13:46,956 --> 01:13:50,091
印度可没有爱达荷的博伊西那么近 凯伦
India is not Boise, Idaho, Karen.

1044
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:52,827
但那里有个拥有和苏菲相同虹膜结构的人
There is someone there with Sofi's exact iris pattern.

1045
01:13:55,063 --> 01:13:57,565
眼睛和大脑是相通的
The eyes and the brain are connected.

1046
01:13:57,567 --> 01:14:00,001
如果不同的人能够拥有
If the cellular structure in the eye

1047
01:14:00,003 --> 01:14:01,936
相同的眼部细胞结构
is reoccurring from person to person,

1048
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:04,005
那或许大脑中的某些东西
then maybe something in the brain

1049
01:14:04,007 --> 01:14:05,540
也是能够被复制的
carries over as well,

1050
01:14:05,542 --> 01:14:08,142
比如某种神经系统上的联系
like a neurological link...

1051
01:14:08,144 --> 01:14:11,746
也许眼睛从某种程度上说真的是...
Maybe the eye really is some kind of...

1052
01:14:11,748 --> 01:14:14,515
灵魂的窗口
window to the soul.

1053
01:14:14,517 --> 01:14:16,184
灵魂？凯伦 灵魂？
Soul, Karen? Soul?

1054
01:14:16,186 --> 01:14:19,620
我的妻子居然会说『灵魂』这个词？
Is my wife really using the word "soul"?

1055
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:22,023
就像你相信它真的存在一样？
Like you hold any validity in that?

1056
01:14:22,025 --> 01:14:23,758
你想怎么称呼它都可以
Call it whatever you want to call it.

1057
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,626
西蒙斯博士测试的是我们的儿子
Dr. Simmons was testing a memory connection

1058
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:29,163
和保罗·埃德加·戴瑞间的记忆联系
between our son and Paul Edgar Dairy.

1059
01:14:29,165 --> 01:14:32,133
这不是我们的实验 但你可以去印度寻找答案
And it wasn't our test,but you can go to India,

1060
01:14:32,135 --> 01:14:34,502
你可以去找那个和苏菲有着一样眼睛的人
and you can find this person with Sofi's eyes,

1061
01:14:34,504 --> 01:14:35,703
然后也做一个相同的测试
and you can do the same.

1062
01:14:35,705 --> 01:14:37,038
我不能去那里
I can't go there.

1063
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,739
不就是印度吗 你为什么不...
It's just India. Why can't you make...

1064
01:14:38,741 --> 01:14:40,141
不是印度 我不能回到那个地方！
Not India. I can't go there!

1065
01:14:40,143 --> 01:14:41,609
不能回到那段记忆里！
I can't go back there!

1066
01:14:41,611 --> 01:14:43,478
我不能回到那一段人生里！
I can't go back to that part of my life!

1067
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:44,712
我做不到！
I can't do it!

1068
01:14:57,826 --> 01:15:00,761
我想做的只有放手
I gotta just let it go.

1069
01:15:16,778 --> 01:15:19,080
我知道我的丈夫
The man I married...

1070
01:15:19,082 --> 01:15:21,749
不是这样的人 他不会让悲伤
I don't think he would let his own grief,

1071
01:15:21,751 --> 01:15:24,085
哪怕是巨大的悲伤
even if it was overwhelming,

1072
01:15:24,087 --> 01:15:26,187
去阻止自己探索一个
get in the way of what could potentially be

1073
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:28,222
可能是全世界迄今为止
the greatest scientific discovery

1074
01:15:28,224 --> 01:15:30,057
最伟大的科学发现
the world has ever seen.

1075
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:34,962
这比你更重要
This is bigger than you.

1076
01:15:34,964 --> 01:15:36,931
比我更重要
It's bigger than me.

1077
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:39,934
比苏菲更重要
It's bigger than Sofi.

1078
01:15:39,936 --> 01:15:42,169
你应该自己去
Then maybe you should go.

1079
01:15:42,171 --> 01:15:44,272
我想去
I would...

1080
01:15:44,274 --> 01:15:48,175
但我不了解苏菲
but I didn't know Sofi.

1081
01:15:48,177 --> 01:15:49,977
这个结果只是巧合罢了 你明白吧
It's a false positive,you understand?

1082
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:51,846
一定是出错了 一定是的
It's an error;it has to be an error.

1083
01:15:51,848 --> 01:15:54,749
从统计学来说这不可能
It's a statistically impossible data point.

1084
01:15:57,619 --> 01:16:00,254
如果我让这把手机掉落一千次
If I drop this phone a thousand times,

1085
01:16:00,256 --> 01:16:02,123
一百万次
a million times,

1086
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:04,559
有那么一次 它没有下坠
and one time it doesn't fall,

1087
01:16:04,561 --> 01:16:06,861
就一次
just once,

1088
01:16:06,863 --> 01:16:08,963
它飘了起来
it hovers...

1089
01:16:08,965 --> 01:16:10,798
悬在了空中
in the air...

1090
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:15,303
哪怕这是个错误 也是值得探究的错误
...that is an error that's worth looking at.

1091
01:16:15,305 --> 01:16:18,272
你真是个固执的人
You're so fucking stubborn.

1092
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:42,229
米拉·戴维的生活
Technology has barely touched

1093
01:16:42,231 --> 01:16:44,031
几乎没有享受过科技的福祉
Mira Devi's daily life.

1094
01:16:44,033 --> 01:16:45,299
在她的小棚屋里
In her hut, muscle,

1095
01:16:45,301 --> 01:16:47,868
日常家务都由双手而非机器完成
not machines,gets the chores done.

1096
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:49,870
但米拉以及数百万相同处境的妇女
That is about to change for Mira

1097
01:16:49,872 --> 01:16:52,139
即将迎来生活的转变
and perhaps millions like her.

1098
01:16:52,141 --> 01:16:53,207
在服务中心
At this center,

1099
01:16:53,209 --> 01:16:55,242
凭借生物识别技术
her irises are scanned

1100
01:16:55,244 --> 01:16:56,377
她的虹膜被扫描登记
with biometric devices.

1101
01:16:56,379 --> 01:16:58,713
资料随后被上载
They're uploaded and then sent

1102
01:16:58,715 --> 01:17:00,381
传送到大型服务器内
to a massive server.

1103
01:17:00,383 --> 01:17:02,817
当资料处理完成后
Once this information is processed,

1104
01:17:02,819 --> 01:17:06,687
她将获得属于自己 独一无二的12位编码
out comes a 12-digit number for her and her only.

1105
01:17:06,689 --> 01:17:08,723
印度独特的身份识别计划
India's unique identification program

1106
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:10,725
于一年前开始实施
started just a year ago.

1107
01:17:10,727 --> 01:17:12,326
一旦成功完成
If it succeeds,

1108
01:17:12,328 --> 01:17:15,830
印度将成为世界上
India will become the first country in the world

1109
01:17:15,832 --> 01:17:17,798
首个在全国范围内实行
using biometric data for identity purposes

1110
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,767
生物身份识别技术的国家
on a national scale.

1111
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:50,831
第一次来印度？
First time to India?

1112
01:17:52,435 --> 01:17:54,035
是的
It is, actually.

1113
01:17:54,037 --> 01:17:55,703
没错
Yeah.

1114
01:17:55,705 --> 01:17:57,171
我叫达里尔·麦肯锡
Darryl Mackenzie.

1115
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:59,073
我是伊恩·格雷博士
Uh, Dr. Ian Gray.

1116
01:17:59,075 --> 01:18:00,808
是个博士呢
Oh, "Doctor."

1117
01:18:03,112 --> 01:18:06,047
两个做着杰出工作的人
Two men, both doing good work.

1118
01:18:06,049 --> 01:18:08,115
你是做什么的
What do you do?

1119
01:18:08,117 --> 01:18:10,818
我是个商人 不过...
Well, I'm in sales,but, uh...

1120
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:14,722
我也为『那个人』服务
...also do The Man's work.

1121
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:19,260
我是牧师
The Lord's work.

1122
01:18:20,697 --> 01:18:22,730
我明白
Uh, of course.

1123
01:18:25,435 --> 01:18:27,702
晚安 格雷博士
Good night, Dr. Gray.

1124
01:18:27,704 --> 01:18:28,969
你也晚安
Uh, have a good night.

1125
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:32,106
希望我们会再见
Hope our paths cross again.

1126
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:15,950
你好
Hello.

1127
01:19:15,952 --> 01:19:18,219
有什么事吗
Uh, can I help you?

1128
01:19:18,221 --> 01:19:20,087
你看着像这里的负责人
You seem like the boss of this place.

1129
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:22,156
负责人？我更像是管马戏团的吧
Boss? No, circus manager, more like it.

1130
01:19:22,158 --> 01:19:23,457
我叫普莉娅·瓦尔玛
I'm Priya Varma.

1131
01:19:23,459 --> 01:19:24,859
请问有什么事
How can I help you?

1132
01:19:24,861 --> 01:19:26,026
我是伊恩·格雷博士
I'm Dr. Ian Gray.

1133
01:19:26,028 --> 01:19:27,795
我是从美国来的
I'm visiting from America.

1134
01:19:27,797 --> 01:19:31,232
我有个请求 听着可能很奇怪
I have a very strange request.

1135
01:19:31,234 --> 01:19:32,967
请说
Yes?

1136
01:19:32,969 --> 01:19:35,069
我在找一个人
I'm looking for someone

1137
01:19:35,071 --> 01:19:37,037
他前不久在这里做的扫描
who was scanned here a while back.

1138
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:39,473
但我不知道他的名字
The thing is, I don't have their name.

1139
01:19:39,475 --> 01:19:42,243
只有他眼睛的照片
All I have is a picture of their eyes.

1140
01:19:46,414 --> 01:19:48,516
他的眼睛是这样的
This is what their eyes look like.

1141
01:19:48,518 --> 01:19:50,851
可能颜色会有点差异
They may not be this exact color.

1142
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:55,489
你为什么要找她
Why are you looking for her?

1143
01:19:55,491 --> 01:19:57,057
她遇到什么麻烦了吗
Is she in some kind of trouble?

1144
01:19:57,059 --> 01:19:58,859
是个女孩？
Her?

1145
01:19:58,861 --> 01:20:00,494
不 当然不是
Uh, no, of course not.

1146
01:20:00,496 --> 01:20:01,929
她没有遇到什么麻烦
She's not in trouble.

1147
01:20:01,931 --> 01:20:03,998
她的眼睛很特别
She's incredibly special.

1148
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,267
你认出她的眼睛来了？
So you do recognize them?

1149
01:20:06,269 --> 01:20:08,569
是的 如果我没认错的话
I do, if it is who I think it is,

1150
01:20:08,571 --> 01:20:10,504
你为什么要找她
but why are you looking for her?

1151
01:20:10,506 --> 01:20:12,473
你看这张照片
Here's another photo.

1152
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:16,443
这是怎么回事
Okay, um,this doesn't make sense.

1153
01:20:16,445 --> 01:20:17,845
这是她的眼睛没错
These are her eyes,

1154
01:20:17,847 --> 01:20:20,147
但这不是她的脸
but this isn't her face around them.

1155
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:23,484
这就是我要找她的原因
That's exactly why I'm looking for her.

1156
01:20:27,055 --> 01:20:28,255
她叫萨罗米娜
Salomina.

1157
01:20:28,257 --> 01:20:29,423
萨罗米娜 - 是的
- Salomina? - Yeah.

1158
01:20:29,425 --> 01:20:32,860
很可爱的女孩 很聪明
Sweet girl, uh,very smart girl.

1159
01:20:32,862 --> 01:20:35,996
但是我有段时间没看见她了
But, uh,I haven't seen her recently.

1160
01:20:35,998 --> 01:20:38,532
你最后一次看见她是什么时候
When was the last time you saw her?

1161
01:20:38,534 --> 01:20:41,101
几个月前
Uh, a few months ago.

1162
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:45,206
你能帮我找到她吗
Could you help me find her?

1163
01:20:46,909 --> 01:20:49,543
我可以给社区中心捐一笔钱
I could make a donation to the community center.

1164
01:20:49,545 --> 01:20:52,112
我是说 我打算给社区中心
I mean,I'm going to make a donation

1165
01:20:52,114 --> 01:20:53,948
捐一笔钱
to the community center.

1166
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:56,517
我不想说得好像我要收买你一样
I don't want to sound crass,like I'm bribing you,

1167
01:20:56,519 --> 01:20:58,385
不过从某种程度上说我是想收买你
but I am kind of bribing you.

1168
01:20:58,387 --> 01:21:00,087
不不不 没关系
No, no, no, of course.

1169
01:21:00,089 --> 01:21:02,890
我是说 任何捐助都会对社区有很大的帮助
I mean, of course, any donation would help the center.

1170
01:21:05,094 --> 01:21:06,927
这件事很重要
It's very important.

1171
01:21:06,929 --> 01:21:08,896
求你了
Please.

1172
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:11,532
好吧
Okay.

1173
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:14,635
你明天中午12点
You meet me tomorrow at 12:00

1174
01:21:14,637 --> 01:21:17,938
到奥卡拉集市等我 可以吗
at the Okhla market, okay?

1175
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:46,567
好吧 我来帮你们...
All right, I'll take a...

1176
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:48,535
你们想让我拍张照吗
You want me to take a photo of you?

1177
01:21:50,473 --> 01:21:52,306
想看吗
You want to see?

1178
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:56,944
看到没 好的
You see? Okay.

1179
01:21:56,946 --> 01:21:58,045
你好
Hello.

1180
01:22:03,618 --> 01:22:05,519
我本来不想来的
I almost didn't come.

1181
01:22:05,521 --> 01:22:07,354
我也担心你不会出现
Yeah, I was worried.

1182
01:22:07,356 --> 01:22:09,423
是什么让你改变了心意
What changed your mind?

1183
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:10,958
我...
I, um...

1184
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,593
我查了你的背景资料
I did some research on you.

1185
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:16,597
来吧
Come.

1186
01:22:22,939 --> 01:22:25,439
你好
Hello.

1187
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:27,107
这些孩子...
Do all these children...

1188
01:22:27,109 --> 01:22:29,643
最后都会到社区中心生活吗 还是...
do they eventually end up at the community center or...

1189
01:22:29,645 --> 01:22:31,979
一部分会
Some do,

1190
01:22:31,981 --> 01:22:34,081
但单单这附近三十个街区
but there are over one million people

1191
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:37,084
就住着一百万多人
living in this 30-block radius alone.

1192
01:22:37,086 --> 01:22:38,986
根据登记的资料
According to the registrar,

1193
01:22:38,988 --> 01:22:41,288
萨罗米娜和她父母住在这里
Salomina and her parents live here.

1194
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:43,958
我去问问那位女士
I'm gonna ask this lady here.

1195
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:45,726
好的
Okay.

1196
01:23:10,518 --> 01:23:12,152
怎么了
What's wrong?

1197
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:13,554
她说什么
What'd she say?

1198
01:23:19,094 --> 01:23:22,396
她现在可能像条流浪狗一样生活
She could be living like a stray dog.

1199
01:23:22,398 --> 01:23:24,064
她孤身一人
She's totally alone.

1200
01:23:24,066 --> 01:23:26,433
她母亲死了 她父亲也死了
Her mother's dead; her father's dead.

1201
01:23:26,435 --> 01:23:29,570
她知道社区中心的地址
She knows the address of the community center,

1202
01:23:29,572 --> 01:23:32,740
但普莉娅说她已经几周没去过那里了
but Priya said she hasn't been there in weeks.

1203
01:23:32,742 --> 01:23:35,642
单是方圆十个街区就有一百万人口
There's a million people living in a ten-block radius.

1204
01:23:35,644 --> 01:23:38,312
要找到她几乎是不可能的事
It's gonna be impossible to find her.

1205
01:23:41,316 --> 01:23:43,550
你不能现在放弃
Well, you shouldn't give up.

1206
01:23:43,552 --> 01:23:45,185
你飞过了半个地球的距离
You flew halfway around the world.

1207
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:46,453
你该继续找下去
You should keep looking.

1208
01:23:46,455 --> 01:23:49,723
至少在那里多待几天
At least give it a few days.

1209
01:23:49,725 --> 01:23:51,759
我要睡了
I'm gonna go to bed.

1210
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:54,728
晚安
Good night.

1211
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:56,497
再见
Bye.

1212
01:24:03,739 --> 01:24:05,706
我到底来这里做什么
What am I doing here?

1213
01:24:33,768 --> 01:24:36,470
你疯了
You're mad.

1214
01:24:36,472 --> 01:24:38,705
这相当于一枚信号弹
It's a smoke signal.

1215
01:24:38,707 --> 01:24:41,708
某个认识她的人会看见的
Someone she knows will see it.

1216
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:45,079
感谢你没把我的号码写在上面
I'm glad you didn't put my number up there.

1217
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:53,520
你好
Hello?

1218
01:24:53,522 --> 01:24:54,655
你好
Hello?

1219
01:24:54,657 --> 01:24:56,723
是的
Hi, yes

1220
01:24:56,725 --> 01:24:59,159
我侄女的眼睛和那板上印的一样 写着现金奖励的那个
Yeah, my niece has eyes like the picture board, cash reward.

1221
01:24:59,161 --> 01:25:01,128
和图片上一样吗
Are they just like the ones in the picture?

1222
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:03,130
我想是的
Yes, I think so.

1223
01:25:03,132 --> 01:25:04,298
完全一样吗
Like, exactly?

1224
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:05,399
几乎一样
Uh, very much so.

1225
01:25:05,401 --> 01:25:06,633
你侄女几岁了
How old is your niece?

1226
01:25:06,635 --> 01:25:07,801
18岁
Eighteen.

1227
01:25:07,803 --> 01:25:09,770
我的小侄女15岁
My other niece is 15.

1228
01:25:09,772 --> 01:25:12,873
那不是的 抱歉
Oh, no, um, sorry.

1229
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:14,274
谢谢 不是的
Thank you, no.

1230
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:15,642
抱歉 不是我找的人
Sorry, wrong person.

1231
01:25:15,644 --> 01:25:17,111
再见
Bye.

1232
01:25:24,153 --> 01:25:25,619
你好
Hello?

1233
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:30,491
你会说英语吗
Do you speak English?

1234
01:25:30,493 --> 01:25:31,792
我会
Yes, I do.

1235
01:25:31,794 --> 01:25:34,495
不好意思 你刚才说什么
I'm sorry, what-what were you saying?

1236
01:25:34,497 --> 01:25:37,431
我的眼睛和你登广告寻找的一样
I have the eyes you took up the advertisement for.

1237
01:25:37,433 --> 01:25:38,732
你多大了
How old are you?

1238
01:25:38,734 --> 01:25:40,234
24岁
Twenty-four.

1239
01:25:40,236 --> 01:25:41,835
抱歉
No, sorry.

1240
01:25:41,837 --> 01:25:43,871
我要找的是一个小女孩
The person I'm looking for is much younger.

1241
01:25:43,873 --> 01:25:45,372
谢谢你打电话过来
No, thank you for calling.

1242
01:25:45,374 --> 01:25:46,507
抱歉
Sorry.

1243
01:26:00,222 --> 01:26:01,722
真棒
Very good!

1244
01:26:01,724 --> 01:26:03,590
我是最棒的 - 我是最棒的吗
I'm the best! - I'm the very best?

1245
01:26:03,592 --> 01:26:05,225
我是最棒的
I'm the very best.

1246
01:26:05,227 --> 01:26:06,727
棒极了
Very good.

1247
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:20,440
格雷博士 你信教么
Dr. Gray, are you religious?

1248
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:24,878
我信教吗
Am I religious?

1249
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,947
你不是调查过我吗
I thought you researched me.

1250
01:26:26,949 --> 01:26:28,649
我不信教
I'm not religious.

1251
01:26:28,651 --> 01:26:30,584
为什么
Why not?

1252
01:26:32,587 --> 01:26:35,756
宗教的基础 是人类于数千年前
Religion is based on scripture written by men

1253
01:26:35,758 --> 01:26:37,457
写下的经文
thousands of years ago.

1254
01:26:37,459 --> 01:26:40,727
那些观点不容改变也不容置疑
Those beliefs can't be changed or challenged.

1255
01:26:40,729 --> 01:26:41,929
是一成不变的
They're fixed.

1256
01:26:41,931 --> 01:26:43,363
而在科学中
In science,

1257
01:26:43,365 --> 01:26:45,732
伟大的思想家 也在很久以前
great thinkers have written things

1258
01:26:45,734 --> 01:26:47,401
写下了各种理论
very long ago,

1259
01:26:47,403 --> 01:26:50,771
但那些理论会不断为后来人所修正
but every generation improves upon them.

1260
01:26:50,773 --> 01:26:52,806
那些文字不是神圣的
The words are not holy.

1261
01:26:52,808 --> 01:26:55,742
爱因斯坦是个伟人 但他并非我们的神
Einstein is a brilliant man,but he's not our god.

1262
01:26:57,478 --> 01:27:01,281
他是知识体系进化过程中的一步
He's one step in the evolution of knowledge,

1263
01:27:01,283 --> 01:27:03,584
但我们还会继续向前跨越
but we always continue to step forward.

1264
01:27:03,586 --> 01:27:04,818
你知道吗
You know...

1265
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:07,487
曾经有位科学家问达赖喇嘛
a scientist once asked the Dalai Lama,

1266
01:27:07,489 --> 01:27:10,524
『如果某天科学将你的信仰证伪』
"What would you do if something scientific

1267
01:27:10,526 --> 01:27:13,427
『你会怎么做？』
disproved your religious beliefs?"

1268
01:27:13,429 --> 01:27:15,629
他在思考良久后回答
And he said, after much thought,

1269
01:27:15,631 --> 01:27:17,698
『我会把所有的文章读上一遍』
"I would look at all the papers.

1270
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:19,533
『我会翻看所有的研究结果』
"I'd take a look at all the research

1271
01:27:19,535 --> 01:27:22,803
『并试着去理解里面的东西』
"and really try tounderstand things.

1272
01:27:22,805 --> 01:27:24,638
『到最后 如果结论清楚地表明』
"And in the end, if it was clear

1273
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:28,675
『科学证据推翻了我的宗教信条』
"that the scientific evidence disproved my spiritual beliefs,

1274
01:27:28,677 --> 01:27:32,446
『那我会重新选择我的信仰』
I would change my beliefs."

1275
01:27:32,448 --> 01:27:34,414
这回答很好
That's a good answer.

1276
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:39,786
伊恩
Ian...

1277
01:27:41,422 --> 01:27:44,625
如果你的科学思想被某些宗教理念证伪
...what would you do if something spiritual

1278
01:27:44,627 --> 01:27:47,928
你又会怎么做呢
disproved your scientific beliefs?

1279
01:28:16,357 --> 01:28:18,025
亲爱的
Hello, love.

1280
01:28:18,027 --> 01:28:20,327
今天银行打电话来
The bank called today.

1281
01:28:20,329 --> 01:28:22,296
他们说有每天都有一笔2000美元的转账
They said that $2,000 a day

1282
01:28:22,298 --> 01:28:23,997
流向一家印度广告公司
is going to some sketchy Planet India company.

1283
01:28:23,999 --> 01:28:25,465
已经累计有两万块了
It's, like, 20k already.

1284
01:28:25,467 --> 01:28:27,534
怎么回事
What's going on?

1285
01:28:27,536 --> 01:28:28,969
我立了块广告牌

1287

1292

我觉得这个研究的前景不是很乐观
I'm down with the big picture of all this.

1293
01:28:46,622 --> 01:28:48,955
虽然当初是我让你去的
I'm the one who wanted you to go.

1294
01:28:48,957 --> 01:28:51,892
但我们也做过不少失败的实验不是吗
But failed experiments are not unknown to us, right?

1295
01:28:51,894 --> 01:28:53,360
