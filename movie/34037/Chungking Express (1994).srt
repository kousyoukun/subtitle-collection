0
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,500


1
00:00:12,501 --> 00:00:29,202


1
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,646
You brush past
so many people every day.

2
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,774
Some you may never know
anything about,

3
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,320
but others might become
your friend someday.

4
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,324
I'm a cop.
My name is He Qiwu,

5
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,077
and 223 is my badge number.

6
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,079
Move it!

7
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,503
Freeze!

8
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,006
Out of the way!

9
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:24,977
Hey!

10
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,741
That was the closest
we ever got -

11
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:43,036
just 0.01 cm between us.

12
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,165
Fifty-seven hours later,

13
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,041
I fell in love with this woman.

14
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,713
Hello? Ma'am?
This is Qiwu.

15
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,259
No, I called to talk to you,
not May.

16
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,011
How are you?

17
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:02,389
Oh, I'm fine.

18
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,726
Yes, best to let May
cool down for a while.

19
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,437
l'm sure she'II caII
when she's ready.

20
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:13,025
Please don't tell her
l caIIed, okay?

21
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,237
You're going to a movie?
l won't keep you.

22
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,198
Is your husband there?

23
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,495
Sir? This is Qiwu.

24
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,667
No, don't caII May.
I just called to say hi to you.

25
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,502
Is your cough better?

26
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:38,300
You're rushing out?
I won't keep you then. No, it's all right.

27
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:41,220
Is May's sister there?
No?

28
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,847
How about her other sister?
l just wanted to say hi.

29
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:47,017
We all have our habits.
Mine is to wait here

30
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,519
for May to get off work.

31
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:54,191
The boss here says she looks like
Yamaguchi Momoe. She likes that.

32
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,318
She and l just broke up.

33
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:59,363
She wished I were more like
Tomokazu Miura myself.

34
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,490
Message for account 368?

35
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,744
Password is
"Love You for 10,000 Years."

36
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,749
Call Ming?
You mean May?

37
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,585
Spell it.

38
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:18,048
M-l-N-G? It's not M-A-Y?

39
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,135
Sure there's no mistake?
You're sure?

40
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,429
Don't you know English?

41
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,978
Ming? I knew it!

42
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,355
l guess May
asked you to call.

43
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,692
I'm fine.
Tell her not to worry, okay?

44
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,319
I'll take good care of myself.

45
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:43,490
But tell her she can call
anytime she wants.

46
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,951
No reason to bother you.

47
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,788
She didn't tell you to call me?

48
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,040
Then why did you page me?

49
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,252
You're jogging?
Did you get dumped again?

50
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,380
No?
Then why go jogging?

51
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,134
A race?
You've lost your mind!

52
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,053
Jogging is private.
You don't jog for an audience.

53
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,972
Forget it. Bye.

54
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,395
We all get our hearts broken
sometime.

55
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,690
Whenever I do,
l go jogging.

56
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,569
The body loses water
when you jog,

57
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,280
so l don't cry as easily.

58
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,324
l can't be crying.

59
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:29,161
May always thought
l was a cool guy.

60
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,292
Still no go with your girlfriend?

61
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,377
It's been a month.

62
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,504
Find someone else.

63
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,424
How about May here?
She's not bad.

64
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,684
She's off early tonight.
Ask her out.

65
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,644
She has a crush on you.

66
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,938
Can't.
I have a date tonight.

67
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,774
Some other time.

68
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,225
Is this one okay, miss?

69
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,936
Get a bigger one,
but nothing fancy.

70
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,674
Give them some beers.

71
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,032
Check, please.

72
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,453
Sometimes I'd spend
the night at May's.

73
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,248
So her parents
wouldn't find out,

74
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:05,085
l'd cIimb down
from the balcony.

75
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,214
Will l ever get
to do that again?

76
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,074
- How much?
- $2,500.

77
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,737
These too.

78
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,592
The date on the can tells me

79
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,052
I don't have much time left.

80
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:47,140
If I don't find those Indians,
I'II be in deep troubIe.

81
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:09,621
I don't know when
l started being so cautious.

82
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:13,583
If I put on a raincoat.
l wear sunglasses too.

83
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:18,379
You never know if it's going
to rain or be sunny.

84

"Love You for 10,000 Years."

87
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,055
Anyone page me?

88
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,641
No, no one's called
for you all day.

89
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,392
Okay. Thanks.

90
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:40,360
We broke up on April Fool's Day,
so l took it as a joke.

91
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,905
l'm willing to humor her
for a month.

92
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,075
Every day l buy

93
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,203
a can of pineappIe
with an expiration date of May 1,

94
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,540
because May loves pineapple,

95
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,668
and May 1 is my birthday.

96
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,503
l tell myself

97
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,590
that if May hasn't come back
by the time l've bought 30 cans,

98
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,426
then our Iove wiII expire too.

99
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,099
Sir, this can expires tomorrow.

100
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,560
Why don't you get
another one?

101
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,353
It's all right.

102
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,860
What time's
your earliest flight tomorrow?

103
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,698
I want to reserve a seat.

104
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,579
One person.

105
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,395
- Have you seen these people?
- No.

106
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,273
Look carefully.
They have kids with them.

107
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,358
I really don't know.

108
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,321
- You really don't know him?
- No, I don't.

109
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,657
I've seen you talking to him!

110
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,243
- Papa!
- It's all right.

111
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,629
My daughter!

112
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,593
Hello?

113
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,762
What do you want?

114
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:16,474
If you don't have some news
within an hour,

115
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,227
you'II never see
your daughter again.

116
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,703
An ice cream for her, please.

117
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,601
Papa!

118
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,484
Some men might sacrifice
their own kid for money,

119
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:12,613
but he wasn't one of them.
One hour later, I left.

120
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,371
Freeze!

121
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,220
It's been six months
since l nabbed anyone,

122
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:39,557
but l finally caught
a wanted man today.

123
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,394
Whenever l had good news,
l always wanted May

124
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,563
to be the first to know.

125
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:52,153
Hello?

126
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:13,633
I'll kill you, Tomokazu Miura!

127
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:32,110
You have any pineapple
that expires on May 1?

128
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,321
- What's the date today?
- April 30.

129
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:39,033
That's right.
Think I stock outdated goods?

130
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,036
There's still two hours to go.

131
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:45,915
Nobody wants stale goods.
Get a fresh can.

132
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:51,003
With you peopIe it's always
"Out with the old, in with the new!"

133
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,423
You reaIize what goes
into making a can of pineapple?

134
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,094
The fruit is grown, harvested, sliced -
and you just throw it away!

135
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,263
How do you think
the pineapple feels?

136
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,307
Buddy, I just work here.

137
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,144
Who cares about the pineapple?
What about how l feeI?

138
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,313
I stock and restock
this stuff aII day.

139
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:13,401
I wish it would never expire.
lt'd save me Ioads of work.

140
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,404
You like expired goods?

141
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,031
Have a whole case
on the house.

142
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,829
When did everything start

143
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,415
having an expiration date?

144
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,335
Swordfish expires.
Meat sauce expires.

145
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,130
Even pIastic wrap expires.

146
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:39,552
l'm starting to  wonder: ls there
anything in this  world that doesn't?

147
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,805
Buddy,
how about some swordfish?

148
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,017
It's expired.
I don't want it.

149
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,480
You don't want it?

150
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,211
l finally found my 30th can

151
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,589
in a convenience store.

152
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,886
As May 1 begins,
l begin to understand.

153
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,889
ln May's eyes,

154
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,017
l'm no different
from a can of pineappIe.

155
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:06,842
You don't want any?
It's delicious.

156
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,346
People say dogs
are man's best friend.

157
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:15,559
So how come mine
won't share my grief now?

158
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:39,041
This must be
some kind of record.

159
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:42,545
l ate all 30 cans that night.

160
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:48,217
Good thing for me
that May wasn't into durian.

161
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,553
l feel like going out
and celebrating.

162
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,973
May's probably in bed by now.

163
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,475
But what about that other May?

164
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:05,276
What brings you back here?

165
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:15,035
I'm thinking of going
to a Iate movie.

166
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,413
She's long gone.

167
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,956
Gone?

168
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:22,793
You thought she'd wait around?
Women can't afford to.

169
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,880
The longer they wait,
the more nervous they get.

170
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,007
Drives them crazy.

171
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,509
She just left with Richard.

172
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,304
You gotta move quickly.

173
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,140
I never dreamed

174
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,143
two Mays could dump me
in one night.

175
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,978
To get over it, l resolve

176
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,063
never to go out
with another May.

177
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,982
Hello? Lulu?

178
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,067
This is Qiwu.

179
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,320
Want to come out for a drink?

180
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,864
You're in bed already?

181
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,241
This early?

182
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,244
You were asleep?

183
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,623
Never mind. Bye.

184
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,543
Hello?

185
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,546
Guess who.

186
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,091
Bingo!

187
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,677
Want to come out for a drink?

188
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:19,099
Your husband won't let you?
When did you get married?

189
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,644
Five years ago?

190
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,647
We haven't seen each other
in over five years?

191
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,899
You have two kids?

192
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,694
You're happy.
That's great.

193
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,198
Well, all the best.

194
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,033
Bye.

195
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,873
Is Kong Siu-Wai there?

196
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,876
This is He Qiwu.

197
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:52,091
We went to fourth grade together.
You remember?

198
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,721
You don't?

199
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,890
Doesn't matter. Bye.

200
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:37,595
Those 30 cans of pineappIe
had left me feeling queasy,

201
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,847
so I went to a bar.

202
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:43,058
I'd heard alcohol
can settle the stomach.

203
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,335
Are you okay?

204
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:13,297
Fine. Another double.

205
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,682
There's a song called
"Love Dies at Dawn."

206
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,352
That's how I feel now.

207
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,604
What can l do to forget May?

208
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,816
l tell myself l'll fall in love

209
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:36,278
with the first woman
who waIks in.

210
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,074
What can I get you?

211
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,825
Whiskey, please.

212
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,632
l have a feeling she'll like me,

213
00:27:56,758 --> 00:28:00,135
but just to be safe,
I decide to ask her a question.

214
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:13,399
Excuse me, miss,
do you like pineapple?

215
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,779
Maybe she's not Cantonese.

216
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,990
Tell me, do you like pineapple?

217
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,549
Do you like pineapple, miss?

218
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,719
Your Mandarin's not bad.

219
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,179
I grew up in Taiwan.
What about you?

220
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:47,057
I'm not in the mood to talk.

221
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,143
Please leave me alone.

222
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,146
We don't have to talk.

223
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,398
Could I just sit here?

224
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:58,986
There are Iots of seats.
Why do you have to sit next to me?

225
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,030
I can tell you're lonely.

226
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,574
Really?

227
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,242
Yes.

228
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:09,580
There are only three reasons
a woman would wear shades this late.

229
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:13,083
First, she's blind.

230
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,378
Second, she's a poseur.

231
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:19,214
Or third, she got jilted

232
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,593
and doesn't want peopIe
to see she's been crying.

233
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,763
And which one am I?

234
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,556
The jilted woman.

235
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,559
It's okay.

236
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:33,937
It happens all the time.
Why cry about it?

237
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:38,567
l've been there too.
I usually go jogging.

238
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,986
I run until I work up a sweat.

239
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,864
Then there's no water left
for tears.

240
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,282
Wanna try it?

241
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,994
I've been running around
aII night. l'm exhausted.

242
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:52,122
If you're looking to chat,

243
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:54,333
please find someone else.

244
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,253
I don't particularly
want to taIk.

245
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,631
I just want
to keep you company.

246
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,927
l know how it feeIs
to have your heart broken.

247
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:09,473
A heartbroken woman
needs a shoulder to lean on.

248
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:14,645
You can pretend
I'm your boyfriend if you want.

249
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,146
I don't have a boyfriend.

250
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,357
And I don't have a girlfriend.

251
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,652
How old are you?

252
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:27,991
Two hours ago, I was still 24.
Now I'm 25.

253
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,578
I won't like you.

254
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,665
Don't be so sure.

255
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:38,502
Give me a chance.
We might hit it off.

256
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,296
Do you like pineapple?

257
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:44,591
What business is that
of yours?

258
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:47,344
I'm just trying
to learn more about you.

259
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,724
I was involved
with a girl for five years.

260
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,520
But then she dumped me.

261
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:59,481
She said
I didn't understand her.

262
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:02,025
So I want to get to know you.

263
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,196
You'll never get to know me.

264
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:11,785
Fine.
Then try to get to know me.

265
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:14,037
What kind of man do you like?

266
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:23,046
Actually, really knowing someone
doesn't mean anything.

267
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,632
People change.

268
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,634
A person may like
pineapple today

269
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,053
and something else tomorrow.

270
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,824
Sir!

271
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,035
We're closing up.

272
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,875
They're closing.

273
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,338
Wanna go jogging?

274
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:50,008
I just want
somewhere to rest.

275
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:42,102
When she said "rest,"
l didn't think she actually meant it.

276
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:48,316
That night, l watched
two old movies on TV

277
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,777
and had four chef's salads.

278
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,817
When the sun rose,
l knew l had to go.

279
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:17,072
As l was leaving,
I took off her shoes.

280
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:22,285
My mother used to say
a woman's feet sweII up

281
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,538
if she sleeps in high heels.

282
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:40,137
She must have walked
a lot that night.

283
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:44,641
Such a pretty woman
should have clean shoes.

284
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:58,548
l was actually born
at 6:00 a.m.,

285
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:02,052
so l'll really be 25
two minutes from now.

286
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:07,390
l've spent a quarter of a century
on this pIanet!

287
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:13,230
To celebrate this historic moment,
l go jogging.

288
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:18,485
l'll get rid of my body's
excess water.

289
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,488
lt feels good.

290
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:27,118
As l Ieave the track,
l decide to ditch my pager.

291
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:31,498
l know very well
no one's gonna call me today.

292
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,801
Account 368.

293
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,928
Password, pIease.

294
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,638
"Love You for 10,000 Years."

295
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:32,350
Your friend in room 702 says
happy birthday.

296
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,770
Thank you.

297
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,316
On May 1, 1994,

298
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:43,111
a woman wishes me
happy birthday.

299
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:48,199
Now I'll remember her
all my life.

300
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:51,911
If memories ever come in a can,

301
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,706
I hope that can never expires.

302
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:59,753
If it has to have a shelf life,
l hope it's 10,000 years.

303
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,965
A Coke, please.

304
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:11,259
Jogging again?

305
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:21,019
Running around
isn't gonna solve anything.

306
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:25,023
Listen, Faye's not bad either.

307
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,066
Who's Faye?

308
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:30,111
Just started here today.

309
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:34,282
Make your move
before Richard beats you to it.

310
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,166
- I'm not into guys.
- Guys?

311
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,626
Coming through!

312
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,753
That was the closest
we ever got -

313
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:49,839
just 0.01 cm between us.

314
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,342
l knew nothing about her.

315
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,011
Six hours later,

316
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,347
she fell in love
with another man.

317
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,907
Chef's salad, please.

318
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,202
For here or to go?

319
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,787
To go.

320
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,960
You new here?
I haven't seen you before.

321
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,508
You like listening
to loud music?

322
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,845
Yes. The louder the better.

323
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,391
Keeps me
from thinking so much.

324
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,562
You don't like to think?

325
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,608
What do you like?

326
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,571
I'll tell you when I find out.

327
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,864
And what do you like?

328
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,494
Chef's salad.

329
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,138
A chef's salad, boss.

330
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,140
Chef's salad again?

331
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:06,225
Aren't you tired of them yet?

332
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,478
- It's not for me.
- Your girlfriend?

333
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,523
Is that her favorite?

334
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:16,319
She never said it wasn't.

335
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,697
Maybe she'd like
something different for once.

336
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,159
Try fish and chips.
lt's deIicious.

337
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:25,370
What if she doesn't like it?

338
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,748
Get both and let her choose.

339
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:30,958
You can't go wrong.

340
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:34,837
- Isn't that wasting money?
- It's not that much.

341
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,548
It's good to give her a choice.

342
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,260
Okay. One chef's salad,
one fish and chips.

343
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,887
All right!

344
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:47,850
Thanks.

345
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,897
Fish and chips, please, boss.

346
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,566
See?

347
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,901
I told you she'd like it.

348
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,695
You were right.

349
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,364
She never toId me
she didn't like chef's salad.

350
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,116
You never -

351
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,250
You never gave her a choice.

352
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,544
lf you had,
she might have told you.

353
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:00,757
Anyway, now you broke the routine.
Try pizza tonight.

354
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,093
l don't know
if she'd like pizza.

355
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:09,932
Then do the same thing:
Get both.

356
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,685
It won't break the bank.

357
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,438
Okay.

358
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:24,739
Want to try
something different again?

359
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:27,658
The hot dogs are good.

360
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,286
No, thanks.
Just black coffee.

361
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:33,122
Nothing for your girlfriend?

362
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:34,791
She left.

363
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,459
Why?

364
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,961
Said she wanted
to try some new dishes.

365
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:41,214
I guess she's right.

366
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,717
Plenty of choice in men,
just like food.

367
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:50,807
I guess I should've stuck
with the chef's saIad.

368
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,894
It's no big deal.

369
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,897
She'll try someone else
and see you're better.

370
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:02,235
She'll come running back.
Don't worry.

371
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,778
Thanks.

372
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:30,680
On every flight, there's one stewardess
you long to seduce.

373
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:34,016
This time last year,
at 25,000 feet,

374
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:37,019
l actually seduced one.

375
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:51,028
l thought we'd stay together
for the long haul,

376
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:54,407
flying like a jumbo jet
on a fuII tank.

377
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,952
But there was an unexpected
change of course.

378
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,582
BIack coffee, pIease.

379
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,252
A week and she's not back?

380
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,046
Excuse me.

381
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,884
Maybe she does have
lots of choices.

382
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:57,470
Then put her out of your mind.

383
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:00,723
You have
plenty of choices too.

384
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,017
Black coffee every night's
no good for you.

385
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:06,771
Can't change just like that.
Have to go slow.

386
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,858
Don't worry.
I'll be okay.

387
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,236
If you say so.

388
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:55,653
Excuse me. The policeman who buys
a chef's salad here every night...

389
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,489
You mean No. 633?

390
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,783
He's off today.

391
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,160
Isn't he off on Saturdays?

392
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:06,789
He changed shifts.
Didn't he teII you?

393
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:22,304
lf you see him again,
could you please give him this?

394
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,099
Sure, no problem.

395
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,460
Thank you.

396
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,401
I have to step out.

397
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:02,780
I have some things
to take care of.

398
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:08,911
We're taking a break.

399
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:18,754
- Where are you going?
- l have to go out too.

400
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:59,128
You here alone tonight?

401
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,172
Everyone was here
a minute ago.

402
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,051
They ran off
just as you walked up.

403
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,305
Something wrong with me?

404
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:11,640
No.

405
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,935
Black coffee.
- Thanks.

406
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,442
Last night...

407
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:25,988
some girl -

408
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,156
What?

409
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,867
Last night some girl -

410
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:33,078
Can you turn that music
down a bit?

411
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:48,093
A girl waited around
a long time for you last night.

412
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:51,638
She left a letter for you.

413
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,975
Really?

414
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:58,187
A stewardess.

415
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:03,817
You wanna read it?
- After my coffee.

416
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,814
Hey, your letter!

417
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,942
Keep it for me.
I'll get it next time.

418
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,424
Hey, boss.

419
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,259
What are you doing here?

420
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:11,385
I'm on duty.

421
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:13,929
- Where's No. 633?
- He's on leave.

422
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:15,389
On leave?

423
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:19,768
Said he got hurt by a pin.
He's recuperating at home.

424
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:22,396
Hurt by a pin?
What's he talking about?

425
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:29,945
Ever since she Ieft,
everything in the apartment is sad.

426
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:33,365
I have to comfort them all
before l go to sleep.

427
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:35,909
You've lost a lot of weight,
you know.

428
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,704
You were so chubby before.

429
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:43,250
Now look at yourself.
You're so skinny.

430
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:48,213
Have more confidence
in yourseIf.

431
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:57,973
l toId you to stop crying.
How long are you going to cry?

432
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:01,310
You have to be strong.

433
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:04,813
You're so limp and shapeless.
Look at you.

434
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,650
I'll help you.

435
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:21,497
There.
Isn't that more comfy?

436
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,999
Why don't you say something?

437
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,169
Don't be mad at her.

438
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,173
We all have moments of doubt.

439
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:34,176
Give her a chance.

440
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,179
Okay?

441
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:40,474
Feeling lonely?

442
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:44,269
You're a real mess.

443
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:47,898
You cold?
l'll warm you up.

444
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,532
- Hello.
- How are you?

445
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:59,785
lt's aII ready.
Need any help?

446
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:02,538
It's not much. I'll manage.

447
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,583
Excuse me.

448
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,587
Pardon me.

449
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,091
- HeIIo.
- Oh, it's you.

450
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,386
Are you better?

451
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:18,762
Better?

452
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:22,516
He said
you got hurt by a pin.

453
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:26,687
Don't listen to his nonsense.

454
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,232
You haven't been
around much lately.

455
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:33,610
l changed shifts.
I'm on this beat now.

456
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:34,903
Really?

457
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:37,406
- Want some help?
- Sure.

458
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,578
See you later.

459
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,084
It's so heavy!

460
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,295
It's light today.

461
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:54,298
Your job must be hard.

462
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:57,217
Work's never fun.

463
00:59:57,885 --> 01:00:00,095
Why'd you take this job?

464
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:03,348
My cousin couldn't find
anyone eIse.

465
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:06,268
I'm just helping out for now.

466
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,604
What did you do before?

467
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:10,939
Lots of things.

468
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,109
I'm saving up.

469
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,944
To go to school?

470
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,447
Never thought of that.

471
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:20,574
I just want to enjoy life.

472
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:22,492
How? Where?

473
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,411
Anywhere.

474
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:26,121
Maybe California.

475
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,792
CaIifornia?
Is it fun there?

476
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:36,131
l said maybe.
If it's not, I can move on.

477
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:39,134
You like to travel?

478
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,887
Don't you?

479
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:45,098
I can take it or leave it.

480
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:52,481
You can come with me.
I almost have enough.

481
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:55,150
We'll see.

482
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:59,321
Are you always like this?

483
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,324
You never came to get
that letter.

484
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:05,369
I've been busy.

485
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:09,665
Give me your address.
l'II maiI it.

486
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:12,084
Otherwise it'll get lost.

487
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,169
Okay.

488
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,781
You live close by.

489
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:47,577
Yeah, right down there.
Drop by sometime.

490
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,371
I will.

491
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,625
Well, let's keep going.

492
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:56,169
You're really sweating.

493
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:58,088
Sure you can manage?

494
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,173
I'm fine.

495
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:57,439
Stop daydreaming, will you?

496
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,775
Think you're a rock star?

497
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:03,862
You've been fooling around
with that all day.

498
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:06,114
Who'd wanna eat it now?

499
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,533
Use a toilet roll or something.

500
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:16,666
You too!

501
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,461
I'm not daydreaming.

502
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:22,672
That's right.
You're sleepwalking!

503
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:28,136
That's right.
I'm sleepwalking.

504
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,264
Whatever you say.

505
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:34,476
I'm sleepwalking.

506
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:38,647
I had a dream that afternoon.

507
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:40,941
lt seemed l was
in his apartment

508
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:44,444
and that I'd wake up
when l Ieft.

509
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,947
l didn't know you never wake up
from some dreams.

510
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:57,874
Some days
l go home for lunch,

511
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,585
because there's always
a chance...

512
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,965
I know you're in there.

513
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:08,176
Come on out.

514
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:10,971
I'll count to three.

515
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:13,598
One...

516
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:15,517
two...

517
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:16,685
three!

518
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:20,188
She used to jump out
and scare me,

519
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:22,858
but she hasn't done it
much recently.

520
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:26,194
l guess games get old
after a whiIe.

521
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:37,789
Maybe she's hiding
in the bathroom.

522
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:39,142
Hello.

523
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:43,271
Hello!

524
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,623
Dummy.

525
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:04,584
- Roast pork and rice.
- Thanks.

526
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:09,005
Excuse me.

527
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,258
Hi.

528
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:15,595
Eating here again, huh?
- Yes.

529
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:20,809
Will you be here a while?

530
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:23,812
Why?

531
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:26,106
No reason.

532
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:31,903
Where are you going?

533
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:34,781
I forgot something.

534
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:38,994
Oh, I still haven't
mailed your letter.

535
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,745
No hurry.

536
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:43,957
AII right.
I'll get around to it.

537
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:52,424
Why are you back?

538
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:56,177
I have to pay the electricity bill.
Can l Ieave this here?

539
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:03,268
Hello? Cousin?

540
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:05,854
I'm still at the market.

541
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:09,941
It's pouring rain here.

542
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:13,862
It's pouring. Listen.

543
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:17,490
What are you talking about?
It's sunny over here.

544
01:07:17,616 --> 01:07:21,202
Really?
Must be a local shower.

545
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:23,329
I'll be back when it stops.

546
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:24,956
Don't forget
the electricity bill.

547
01:07:25,082 --> 01:07:26,708
I won't.

548
01:09:12,606 --> 01:09:14,023
I'm going now.

549
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,109
It's okay.

550
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:18,528
I'll be back to see you soon.

551
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:44,762
These are for you.

552
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:49,350
Why all the lychees?

553
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:51,603
They're for a friend.

554
01:09:57,401 --> 01:09:58,943
Where are you?

555
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,112
Paying the electricity bill.

556
01:10:01,238 --> 01:10:03,031
All this time?

557
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:06,492
It's packed here.
I can hardly get in the store.

558
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,161
I have to wait in line.

559
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:12,207
How come it's always so crowded?
You've been trying for days.

560
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:16,628
I don't want to.

561
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:22,550
l'm doing my best.
Should I try again tomorrow?

562
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:25,470
Try another store.

563
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:27,972
Another store?

564
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:32,060
Okay. You're sure?

565
01:10:35,272 --> 01:10:36,606
Hi.

566
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:38,900
Been shopping?

567
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,861
A friend is redecorating
his place.

568
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:45,240
- You sure are busy.
- l certainIy am.

569
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:50,578
Black coffee again.
lt's bad for you.

570
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:53,873
If you can't sleep at night,
drink water.

571
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:31,411
Man in my dreams

572
01:11:31,578 --> 01:11:34,998
l hold you tight for a minute

573
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:38,626
And kiss you for hours

574
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:46,426
Stranger

575
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:50,263
You stole into my heart

576
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:54,058
And set it all awhirl

577
01:11:56,895 --> 01:12:00,648
I've been in love
with you before

578
01:12:00,774 --> 01:12:03,943
But never felt so close
to you as now

579
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:08,489
My thoughts careen
out of control

580
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:15,830
Why have you taken me
by storm

581
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:19,625
Bursting into my dreary dreams

582
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:23,755
Sending shock waves
in every direction

583
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:47,070
Man in my dreams

584
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:50,740
l want you to be real

585
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:54,827
My heart can no longer resist

586
01:12:58,582 --> 01:13:02,502
Searching in my dreams

587
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:05,213
At this minute l'm waiting

588
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:09,550
To kiss you for hours

589
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:18,202
Hi, it's me.

590
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:21,664
The plane's back in Hong Kong.
Want to make a reservation?

591
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:24,834
I'm at the same number. Call me.
Bye-bye.

592
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:20,181
Nice hair!
Did it take long to grow?

593
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:22,433
None of your business.

594
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:27,688
Kind of a flirt, isn't she?

595
01:15:27,814 --> 01:15:29,357
I guess so.

596
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:34,820
What is it?

597
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:37,657
Have you known her long?

598
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:39,283
No.

599
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:50,628
One day l had this sudden
feeling she was back.

600
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:27,081
Did l leave the faucet running,

601
01:16:27,207 --> 01:16:30,084
or is the apartment
getting more weepy?

602
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,753
l thought it  would cope all right.

603
01:16:32,879 --> 01:16:34,880
I didn't expect it
to weep this much.

604
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:39,093
When people cry,
you just give them a tissue.

605
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:43,180
But when an apartment cries,
it's a Iot of work to mop it up.

606
01:17:02,659 --> 01:17:04,619
What are you doing here?

607
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:07,538
- l Iive here.
- You live here?

608
01:17:07,664 --> 01:17:09,624
What are you doing here?

609
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:11,917
I came to buy goldfish.

610
01:17:12,753 --> 01:17:15,421
- Someone around here sell goldfish?
- No.

611
01:17:15,547 --> 01:17:18,799
Then why come to buy goldfish?
You buying or selling?

612
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:21,927
What? No -
I mean, I'm buying.

613
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:26,265
Stop it! I forget everything
when l'm scared.

614
01:17:26,391 --> 01:17:27,642
Why are you scared?

615
01:17:27,768 --> 01:17:30,936
l got scared
when I saw you here.

616
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:32,688
I'm going now.

617
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:40,446
You said you were going.
Well?

618
01:17:40,947 --> 01:17:44,867
I can't move my legs.
l'd go if l couId.

619
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,661
You have a cramp?

620
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:49,789
I don't know.
It's never happened before.

621
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,625
Maybe you should come in
and sit down.

622
01:18:02,636 --> 01:18:06,472
When she'd return from a long flight,
l'd massage her legs.

623
01:18:06,598 --> 01:18:09,016
Being a stewardess
is a tough job.

624
01:18:09,601 --> 01:18:11,852
l've always found
women's legs sexy.

625
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:15,856
But l haven't touched any
since she left.

626
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:26,200
- Better?
- I guess.

627
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:28,536
Can I go now?
- Stay a while longer.

628
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:30,621
I'll put on some music.

629
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:55,563
You like this song too?

630
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:58,816
Not really.
My girlfriend liked it.

631
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:04,989
She really liked this song?

632
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:07,241
Yes.

633
01:19:15,876 --> 01:19:18,753
I know it isn't true.

634
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:22,590
That's my CD.
l left it here a few days ago.

635
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:27,762
l'm starting to  wonder:
can sleepwalking be contagious?

636
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:30,264
l guess l've been too nervous.

637
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:32,850
After a whiIe, I feII asIeep.

638
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:58,793
The girl fell asleep
in my place that afternoon.

639
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:02,004
l thought
about waking her up,

640
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:04,298
but for some reason I didn't.

641
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:37,790
Oh, no!

642
01:20:42,128 --> 01:20:43,879
Watch out for the flames.

643
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:48,175
Make sure
those candles are secure.

644
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:50,761
Don't burn yourself.

645
01:20:52,973 --> 01:20:55,099
What's gotten into you lately?

646
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:58,686
Why didn't you pay
the eIectricity biII?

647
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:01,021
Where have you been
going every day?

648
01:21:02,148 --> 01:21:03,774
I went to see the doctor.

649
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:07,444
The doctor? I haven't seen you
taking any medicine.

650
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:10,322
You just didn't notice.

651
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:14,702
Did he say
when you'd get better?

652
01:21:14,911 --> 01:21:17,663
Should be any day now.

653
01:21:23,628 --> 01:21:25,296
You're crazy!

654
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:40,853
Maybe it's the change of season,

655
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:43,272
but lately l've changed a lot.

656
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:45,691
I've become more observant.

657
01:21:45,817 --> 01:21:48,569
l notice things
l used to take for granted.

658
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:54,909
Even the sardines taste different.

659
01:22:49,172 --> 01:22:51,507
You mustn't let yourself go.

660
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:57,513
You were fine before.
Now you've suddenly put on weight.

661
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:03,143
She Ieft,
but you have to carry on.

662
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:07,523
You can't go on
indulging yourself.

663
01:23:08,066 --> 01:23:10,275
You know, I have to tell you:

664
01:23:10,777 --> 01:23:12,903
you've totally changed.

665
01:23:13,446 --> 01:23:15,864
You can't just
change personality like this.

666
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:20,035
Her walking out is no excuse.

667
01:23:22,038 --> 01:23:24,373
l want you
to think about that.

668
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:33,048
It was a relief
when l saw it crying.

669
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:36,010
lt may look different
on the outside.

670
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:38,971
but it's still true to itself.

671
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:40,889
lt's stiII
a very emotional towel.

672
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:43,392
Have you noticed
I've perked up?

673
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:46,520
Things are starting
to look better.

674
01:23:47,313 --> 01:23:49,481
You used to look sorta dumb,

675
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:52,860
but now you're looking
quite cute.

676
01:23:53,486 --> 01:23:56,196
But you mustn't
let yourself get so dirty.

677
01:23:56,322 --> 01:23:59,033
You used to be
so clean and white.

678
01:23:59,492 --> 01:24:01,952
Now you've turned all yellow.

679
01:24:02,078 --> 01:24:05,039
Look at these scars.

680
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:10,002
Have you been
getting in fights?

681
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:17,843
Why were you hiding in there?

682
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:21,388
I've been looking
aII over for you.

683
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:24,808
What's the point of hiding?

684
01:24:24,934 --> 01:24:27,478
You have to face reality.

685
01:24:30,398 --> 01:24:32,566
You're all moldy.

686
01:24:33,693 --> 01:24:36,945
Tell you what.
I'm not busy tomorrow.

687
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:39,406
I'll take you out for some sun.

688
01:25:25,703 --> 01:25:27,371
What are you doing
in my apartment?

689
01:25:27,497 --> 01:25:29,790
You said to drop by!

690
01:25:32,335 --> 01:25:36,213
Open up
or I'll break the door down!

691
01:26:07,078 --> 01:26:09,788
There's someone
Iooking for you.

692
01:26:09,914 --> 01:26:11,582
- Me?
- Yeah.

693
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:20,465
- What do you want?
- I've come for my letter.

694
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:22,718
What Ietter?
Ask the boss.

695
01:26:23,595 --> 01:26:26,180
You were keeping it.

696
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:28,098
He said you had it.

697
01:26:28,224 --> 01:26:29,516
I do?

698
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:33,145
I have it?

699
01:26:33,271 --> 01:26:34,938
Oh, right.

700
01:26:38,776 --> 01:26:42,196
I was afraid someone might take it.
I didn't read it.

701
01:26:46,951 --> 01:26:48,035
Thanks.

702
01:26:50,455 --> 01:26:52,915
Are you free tomorrow night?

703
01:26:53,124 --> 01:26:55,042
Why do you ask?

704
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,544
- I want to ask you out.
- On a date?

705
01:26:57,670 --> 01:27:00,130
The boss says
you're off tomorrow.

706
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:04,051
So I have to go on a date?

707
01:27:04,177 --> 01:27:06,053
Think it over.

708
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:11,016
I'll meet you across the street
at the California at 8:00.

709
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:15,979
That music's not your style.

710
01:27:16,105 --> 01:27:17,940
Here's your CD back.

711
01:27:30,787 --> 01:27:32,579
Damn it!

712
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:36,583
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

713
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:42,756
No. 633
is a smooth operator.

714
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:45,884
- lt's 663.
- Whatever it is!

715
01:27:51,683 --> 01:27:54,101
Wait!

716
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:08,573
- Where's my Coke?
- I'm out of cups!

717
01:28:18,793 --> 01:28:21,670
l gave my place
a thorough cleaning that afternoon.

718
01:28:21,796 --> 01:28:25,716
lt was like clearing the runway
for another pIane to Iand.

719
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:07,507
l got to the California
really early that night.

720
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:09,843
l half expected a flight delay,

721
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:12,304
so l got
some loose change.

722
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:25,734
Change, please.

723
01:29:44,754 --> 01:29:48,090
Half an hour later,
l broke another $10 bill.

724
01:29:49,008 --> 01:29:51,968
l started thinking
maybe the flight was canceled.

725
01:30:15,451 --> 01:30:17,244
She isn't coming.

726
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:20,163
She asked me
to give you this.

727
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:24,751
Don't look so down.

728
01:30:24,919 --> 01:30:28,088
She didn't work out,
so try another girl.

729
01:30:28,214 --> 01:30:32,050
May's coming back tomorrow.
Give her a try.

730
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:35,595
- Where is she?
- She quit.

731
01:30:35,721 --> 01:30:37,973
Said she was going
to California.

732
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:40,434
That's all.

733
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:42,227
Thanks.

734
01:30:47,024 --> 01:30:49,234
I didn't read the letter.

735
01:30:50,069 --> 01:30:52,821
Some things take time
to sink in.

736
01:30:53,197 --> 01:30:55,699
After the snack-bar manager left,

737
01:30:55,825 --> 01:30:58,201
l started talking
to the beer bottles.

738
01:30:58,786 --> 01:31:00,579
Disappointed?

739
01:31:01,164 --> 01:31:02,914
Not really.

740
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:07,127
Go home to bed.
She's not coming.

741
01:31:18,014 --> 01:31:19,973
Actually, she wasn't
a no-show that night.

742
01:31:20,099 --> 01:31:22,309
She just got the place wrong.

743
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:25,145
We were
in different Californias

744
01:31:25,646 --> 01:31:28,440
15 hours apart.

745
01:31:29,358 --> 01:31:32,944
It must be 11:00 a.m.
over there now.

746
01:31:34,071 --> 01:31:37,657
I wonder if she'll remember
our 8:00 p.m. date here.

747
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:56,218
What a coincidence!

748
01:31:59,055 --> 01:32:00,847
Not on duty tonight?

749
01:32:01,098 --> 01:32:02,682
That's right.

750
01:32:04,268 --> 01:32:05,936
How are you?

751
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:08,355
Fine. And you?

752
01:32:08,731 --> 01:32:10,065
I'm okay.

753
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:12,984
You alone?

754
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:16,196
No, I'm with a friend.

755
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:19,866
He's your type.

756
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:23,286
You still have stuff
at my place.

757
01:32:23,663 --> 01:32:25,080
Come get it sometime.

758
01:32:25,623 --> 01:32:28,542
That's aII right.
Just throw it out.

759
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:32,796
All right.

760
01:32:36,676 --> 01:32:38,301
I gotta go.

761
01:32:41,097 --> 01:32:43,974
l stiII think
you look better in uniform.

762
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:45,433
So do you.

763
01:32:49,689 --> 01:32:51,273
Hey, you didn't pay.

764
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:52,732
You pay for me.

765
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:26,016
How much is it?

766
01:35:08,327 --> 01:35:12,622
The Ietter turned out to be
a boarding pass dated for one year later,

767
01:35:13,082 --> 01:35:15,542
but I couldn't make out

768
01:35:15,668 --> 01:35:17,335
the destination.

769
01:35:29,348 --> 01:35:31,975
l actually did show up
that evening.

770
01:35:32,101 --> 01:35:35,729
l knew it  would get crowded,
so l got there at 7:15.

771
01:35:36,689 --> 01:35:38,940
lt was pouring outside.

772
01:35:39,066 --> 01:35:43,486
Watching through the window,
l saw a rainy California.

773
01:35:44,572 --> 01:35:48,283
l needed to know if the other
California was warm and sunny.

774
01:35:48,534 --> 01:35:50,910
l decided to give myself
one year.

775
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:56,332
Tonight it's raining
as hard as it was then.

776
01:35:56,709 --> 01:35:58,626
Looking out this window,

777
01:35:58,753 --> 01:36:01,212
there's just one person
in my thoughts.

778
01:36:02,673 --> 01:36:05,258
I wonder if he ever
opened my letter.

779
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:03,107
What are you doing here?

780
01:37:04,985 --> 01:37:06,444
Hey!

781
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:09,697
What are you doing here?

782
01:37:10,366 --> 01:37:11,658
Is that really you?

783
01:37:12,243 --> 01:37:14,786
Yeah.
What are you doing here?

784
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:16,162
Renovating.

785
01:37:16,622 --> 01:37:18,248
Renovating?

786
01:37:19,124 --> 01:37:20,792
Where's my cousin?

787
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:23,711
He opened a karaoke bar.

788
01:37:25,798 --> 01:37:27,799
Said he needed a change.

789
01:37:27,925 --> 01:37:31,052
He let me take over here.
Didn't he teII you?

790
01:37:31,762 --> 01:37:34,514
No, I haven't seen him.

791
01:37:34,765 --> 01:37:37,141
He's a shrewd businessman.

792
01:37:38,185 --> 01:37:40,687
First he sells me
fish and chips,

793
01:37:40,813 --> 01:37:42,355
and then the whole shop.

794
01:37:42,523 --> 01:37:43,940
What?

795
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:47,193
I said your cousin
is a shrewd businessman!

796
01:37:52,533 --> 01:37:55,368
Since when do you like
this loud music?

797
01:37:57,413 --> 01:38:00,290
With a little time,
I get used to things.

798
01:38:02,042 --> 01:38:17,223
Did you go to California?
Was it fun?

799
01:38:17,808 --> 01:38:19,726
California...

800
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:22,562
was okay.
Nothing special.

801
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:32,030
You look good in uniform.

802
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:35,450
You look nice like that too.

803
01:38:35,784 --> 01:38:37,577
Want something to eat?

804
01:38:37,786 --> 01:38:39,454
I better not.

805
01:38:40,748 --> 01:38:43,166
I fly out real early tomorrow.

806
01:38:45,419 --> 01:38:47,503
When will you be back?

807
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:50,465
My grand opening
is in two days.

808
01:38:52,301 --> 01:38:53,843
I don't know.

809
01:38:54,303 --> 01:38:57,305
This might be a long trip.

810
01:39:00,643 --> 01:39:03,144
Write to me when you reach
wherever it is.

811
01:39:05,981 --> 01:39:08,274
You probably
wouldn't read it anyway.

812
01:39:10,819 --> 01:39:13,237
I have to ask you something.

813
01:39:23,832 --> 01:39:25,875
Would you let someone board

814
01:39:26,001 --> 01:39:28,086
with a boarding pass like this?

815
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:35,885
It's dated today,
but it got blurred in the rain.

816
01:39:36,512 --> 01:39:38,471
I can't tell

817
01:39:38,597 --> 01:39:41,474
where it's taking me.
Do you know?

818
01:39:43,352 --> 01:39:44,894
No...

819
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:48,731
but I'll give you
another one.

820
01:39:52,653 --> 01:39:54,153
Great.

821
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:06,541
Where do you want to go?

822
01:40:07,751 --> 01:40:11,546
Doesn't matter.
Wherever you want to take me.
