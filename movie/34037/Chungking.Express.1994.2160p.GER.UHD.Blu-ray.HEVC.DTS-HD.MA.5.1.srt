1
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,590
每天你都有机会跟别人擦身而过
You brush past so many people every day.

2
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,700
你也许对他一无所知
Some you may never know anything about,

3
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:22,270
不过也许有一天  他会变成一个朋友或者是知己
but others might become your friend someday.

4
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,280
我是一个警察  我的名字叫作何志武
I'm a cop. My name is He Qiwu,

5
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,010
编号223
and 223 is my badge number.

6
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,010
让开
Move it!

7
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,450
站住
Freeze!

8
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,960
别挡路
Out of the way!

9
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,980
我们最接近的时侯  我跟她之间的距离只有0.01公分
That was the closest we ever got just 0.01 cm between us.

10
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,080
57个小时之后
Fifty-seven hours later,

11
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,990
我爱上了这个女人
I fell in love with this woman.

12
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,660
喂  伯母  我是阿武
Hello? Ma'am? This is Qiwu.

13
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,330
我不是找阿May的
No, I called to talk to you, not May.

14
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,270
我是特地打电话来问候你的
No, I called to talk to you, not May.

15
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,930
你好吗?
How are you?

16
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,340
我?  没事没事
Oh, I'm fine.

17
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,670
她呢  是脾气大了一点  让她冷静一下
Yes, best to let May cool down for a while.

18
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,370
她想通了会打电话给我的
I'm sure she'll call when she's ready.

19
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,990
喂  伯母  你千万别跟她说我打过电话来  好不好?
Please don't tell her I called, okay?

20
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,180
噢  你要去看电影啊?  那我不打扰了
You're going to a movie? I won't keep you.

21
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,160
伯父呢?
Is your husband there?

22
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,430
喂  伯父  我是阿武
Sir? This is Qiwu.

23
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,600
不是  不是  我不是找阿May的  我是特地打电话来问候你的
No, don't call May. I just called to say hi to you.

24
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,430
你的咳嗽好了没有?
Is your cough better?

25
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:07,240
噢  你们赶时间啊?  那么我不打扰你们了  你们去啊  没关系
You're rushing out? I won't keep you then. No, it's all right.

26
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,140
噢  四姐在不在你这边啊?  不在啊?
Is May's sister there? No?

27
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,780
三姐呢?  我想问候她
How about her other sister? I just wanted to say hi.

28
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,940
每一个人都有一个习惯  我的习惯呢
We all have our habits. Mine is to wait here

29
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,450
就是来这边等阿May下班
for May to get off work.

30
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,120
阿May很喜欢来这边  因为那个老板说她很像山口百惠
The boss here says she looks like Yamaguchi Momoe. She likes that.

31
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,260
最近我跟她分手了
She and I just broke up.

32
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,300
因为她说我越来越不像三埔友和
She wished I were more like Tomokazu Miura myself.

33
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,440
368复机
Message for account 368?

34
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,710
密码  "爱你一万年"
Password is "Love You for 10,000 Years."

35
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,680
阿明找我?  阿May吧?
Call Ming? You mean May?

36
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,510
拼给我听啊
Spell it.

37
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,980
M-I-N-G?  M-A-Y吧?
M-I-N-G? It's not M-A-Y?

38
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,090
你有没有听错啊你?  没有?
Sure there's no mistake? You're sure?

39
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,350
你懂不懂英文?
Don't you know English?

40
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,920
喂?  阿明啊?  我知道我知道
Ming? I knew it!

41
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,290
是阿May叫你打给我的吗?
I guess May asked you to call.

42
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,630
噢  我没事  叫她不要担心  好不好?
I'm fine. Tell her not to worry, okay?

43
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,270
我会好好地照顾我自己的
I'll take good care of myself.

44
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,430
可是如果她这么想念我的话呢?  你叫她自己打给我嘛
But tell her she can call anytime she wants.

45
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,910
不用麻烦你  对不对?
No reason to bother you.

46
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,740
啊?  她没叫你打给我?
She didn't tell you to call me?

47
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,980
那你找我什么事?
Then why did you page me?

48
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,180
去跑步?  你失恋了?
You're jogging? Did you get dumped again?

49
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,320
没有?  那为什么去跑步呢?
No? Then why go jogging?

50
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,060
比赛?  你神经啊
A race? You've lost your mind!

51
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,990
跑步这么私人的事情  怎么可以随便跑给人家看?
Jogging is private. You don't jog for an audience.

52
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,900
就这样  拜拜
Forget it. Bye.

53
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,330
每个人都有失恋的时候
We all get our hearts broken sometime.

54
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,640
而每一次我失恋呢  我就会去跑步
Whenever I do, I go jogging.

55
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,510
因为跑步可以将你身体里面的水分蒸发掉
The body loses water when you jog,

56
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,210
而让我不那么容易流泪
so I don't cry as easily.

57
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,250
我怎么可以流泪呢?
I can't be crying.

58
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,080
在阿May的心里  我可是一个很酷的男人
May always thought I was a cool guy.

59
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,220
还没和好啊?
Still no go with your girlfriend?

60
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,330
都一个月了
It's been a month.

61
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,430
再找一个吧
Find someone else.

62
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,360
阿May吧  阿May不错的
How about May here? She's not bad.

63
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,800
你好
Hello.

64
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,640
她今天晚上早下班  你约她逛街吧
She's off early tonight. Ask her out.

65
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,580
她暗恋你很久了
She has a crush on you.

66
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,880
不行啊  今天约了人家
Can't. I have a date tonight.

67
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,710
改天吧
Some other time.

68
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,220
- 你们真的愿意做吗?  - 是的
- Are you sure you want to do it?  - Yes.

69
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,050

Give me your passports.

Next.

71
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,870
下一个
Next.

72
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,960
下一个
Next.

73
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,910
你  坐下
Hey, You! You! Sit down.

74
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,170
这个可以吗?
Is this one okay, miss?

75
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,860
- 一个大的  一个普通的  - 0K
- Get a bigger one, but nothing fancy. - OK.

76
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,560
喂  放下
Hey, Put it down!

77
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,460
别拍了  放下
I said don't shot, put it down.

78
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,000
别摸
Don't touch!

79
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,630
给大家啤酒
Give them some beers.

80
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,990
结帐
Check, please.

81
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,390
有时候我会在阿May家过夜
Sometimes I'd spend the night at May's.

82
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,190
可是为了不想让她爸爸妈妈知道呢
So her parents wouldn't find out,

83
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,030
每次我走的时候  我都会从阳台爬下去
I'd climb down from the balcony.

84
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,140
也不知道以后会不会有这个机会呢?
Will I ever get to do that again?

85
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,990
- 多少钱?  - 两千五百
- How much? - $2,500.

86
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,560
以后再说  好吗?
Latter, OK?

87
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,140
你在干嘛?  走
What are you doing? Go!

88
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,790
你们两个  过来
Hey, you two, come here.

89
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,480
跟着我  去结账
Follow me, go check it.

90
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,670
这个也是
These too.

91
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,580
过来
Come.

92
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,830
他不在这里
He's not here.

93
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,410
- 你知道他在哪里吗?  - 不知道  他说把这个交给你
- Do you konw where he is? - No. He left this for you.

94
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,550
罐头上面的日子告诉我
The date on the can tells me,

95
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,990
我剩的时间不多
I don't have much time left.

96
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,790
如果我找不到那班印度人  我就会有麻烦
If I don't find those Indians, I'll be in deep trouble.

97
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,610
为何穿雨衣?
Why the raincoat?

98
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,760
好像快要下雨了
I think it will rain.

99
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,540
不知道什么时候开始  我变成一个很小心的人
I don't know when I started being so cautious.

100
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,520
每次穿雨衣  我都会戴太阳眼镜
If I put on a raincoat, I wear sunglasses too.

101
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:47,320
你永远都不会知道什么时候会下雨  什么时候出太阳
You never know if it's going to rain or be sunny.

102

106

没有啊  整天没有人找你
No, no one's called for you all day.

107
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,330
谢谢
Okay. Thanks.

108
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,310
我们分手的那天是愚人节  所以我一直当她是开玩笑
We broke up on April Fool's Day, so I took it as a joke.

109
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,840
我愿意让她这个玩笑维持一个月
I'm willing to humor her for a month.

110
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,020
从分手的那一天开始
Every day I buy

111
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:19,160
我每天都买一罐5月1号到期的凤梨罐头
a can of pineapple with an expiration date of May 1,

112
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,490
因为凤梨是阿May最爱吃的东西
because May loves pineapple,

113
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,630
而5月1号是我的生日
and May 1 is my birthday.

114
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,450
我告诉我自己
I tell myself

115
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:31,530
当我买满30罐的时侯  她如果还不回来
that if May hasn't come back by the time I've bought 30 cans,

116
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,370
这一段感情就会过期
then our love will expire too.

117
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,030
先生  这个罐头明天就过期了
Sir, this can expires tomorrow.

118
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,510
那边还有很多  你再换一罐吧
Why don't you get another one?

119
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,310
没关系
It's all right.

120
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,790
明天早上最早一班班机是几点?
What time's your earliest flight tomorrow?

121
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,650
我要定位置
I want to reserve a seat.

122
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,520
一个人
One person.

123
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,320
- 你看过这几个人吗?  - 没有
- Have you seen these people? - No.

124
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,220
你要看清楚  也有孩子
Look carefully. They have kids with them.

125
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,290
我真的不知道
I really don't know.

- 你看过这些人吗?  - 没有

127
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,180
- 这个人呢?  - 没有

128
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,610
没有吗?
No?

129
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,270
- 你真的不认识他吗?  - 不认识
- You really don't know him? - No, I don't.

130
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,600
我看见你跟他说过话
I've seen you talking to him!

131
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:23,180
- 爸爸  - 没事的

132
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,550
我的女儿呢?
Where's my daughter?

133
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,530

00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,540
爸爸
Papa!

139
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,420
有的人为了钱  连子女都不要  但是他不像
Some men might sacrifice their own kid for money, but he wasn't one of them.

140
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:41,550
一个钟头之后  我就走了
One hour later, I left.

141
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,300
我是警察  站住
Police! Freeze!

142
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,150
我已经六个月都没有破过案
It's been six months since I nabbed anyone,

143
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,510
可是今天呢  终于抓到一个通缉犯
but I finally caught a wanted man today.

144
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,350
每一次我有好消息  我第一个想通知的就是我女朋友阿May
Whenever I had good news, I always wanted May to be the first to know.

145
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,490
喂?
Hello?

146
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,100
喂?
Hello?

147
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,580
三埔友和  我要杀了你
I'll kill you, Tomokazu Miura!

148
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,070
啊  请问有没有5月1号到期的凤梨罐头?
You have any pineapple that expires on May 1?

149
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,270
- 今天几号了?  - 4月30啊
- What's the date today? - April 30.

150
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,970
是啊  明天过期的东西我们不会摆出来的
That's right. Think I stock outdated goods?

151
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,980
还有两个钟头  这么早就收掉了?
There's still two hours to go.

152
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:14,850
过期的东西没人要的  人家要买也要买新鲜的
Nobody wants stale goods. Get a fresh can.

153
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:19,960
新鲜新鲜  什么新鲜啊?  就是你这种人  喜新厌旧
With you people it's always "Out with the old, in with the new!"

154
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,350
喂  弄一罐凤梨罐头  要花多少新鲜  你知道吗?
You realize what goes into making a can of pineapple?

155
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:27,020
又要种  又要摘  又要切  你说不要就不要啊?
The fruit is grown, harvested, sliced -- and you just throw it away!

156
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,190
你有没有想过罐头的感受?
How do you think the pineapple feels?

157
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,270
先生  我只是职员  我负责卖东西的
Buddy, I just work here.

158
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,600
你叫我去想罐头的感受?
Who cares about the pineapple?

159
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,170
你有没有想过我的感受?
What about how I feel?

160
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,240
又要抬  又要搬  还要负责扔
I stock and restock this stuff all day.

161
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:42,350
我也希望那些罐头永远不会过期  我还省功夫呢
I wish it would never expire. It'd save me loads of work.

162
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,340
你那么爱过期罐头是吗?
You like expired canned food?

163
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,990
我这里有一箱  全送给你  不收你钱
Here you are. Take as much as you like. It's on the house.

164
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,790
不知道从什么时候开始
When did everything start

165
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,360
在每个东西上面都有一个日子
having an expiration date?

166
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,290
秋刀鱼会过期  肉酱也会过期
Swordfish expires. Meat sauce expires.

167
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,060
连保鲜纸都会过期
Even plastic wrap expires.

168
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:08,510
我开始怀疑  在这个世界上  还有什么东西是不会过期的?
I'm starting to wonder: Is there anything in this world that doesn't?

169
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:11,730
老师傅  秋刀鱼要不要?
Buddy, how about some swordfish?

170
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,980
过期的  不要  你要吧
It's expired. I don't want it.

171
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,410
不要?
You don't want it?

172
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,160
终于在一家便利商店  让我找到第30罐凤梨罐头
I finally found my 30th can of pineapples in a convenience store.

173
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,830
就在5月l号的早晨  我开始明白一件事情
As May 1 begins, I begin to understand.

174
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,840
在阿May的心中
In May's eyes,

175
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,950
我跟这个凤梨罐头没有什么分别
I'm no different from a can of pineapple.

176
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,780
不吃?  这么好的东西你都不吃
You don't want any? It's delicious.

177
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,280
有人说  狗是人类最好的朋友
People say dogs are man's best friend.

178
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:44,480
可是为什么在这个时候  它却不肯跟我分享我的痛苦呢?
So how come mine won't share my grief now?

179
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,970
不知道算不算是一个记录呢?
This must be some kind of record.

180
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:11,480
那一天晚上我吃掉所有的凤梨
I ate all 30 cans that night.

181
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,150
还好阿May不喜欢吃榴莲  要不然我一定是完蛋了
Good thing for me that May wasn't into durian.

182
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,480
我好想去庆祝一下
I feel like going out and celebrating.

183
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,920
阿May可能已经睡着了
May's probably in bed by now.

184
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:25,430
可是我不知道另外一个阿May呢?
But what about that other May?

185
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,200
哎  你回来干什么?
What brings you back here?

186
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,980
我今天心情好  想看子夜场
I'm thinking of going to a late movie.

187
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,340
嘿嘿  她走了  她走了
She's long gone.

188
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,880
走了?
Gone?

189
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:51,720
难道等你啊?  女人不能等的
You thought she'd wait around? Women can't afford to.

190
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:54,820
越等越会晚  越晚越担心
The longer they wait, the more nervous they get.

191
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,960
最后担心得像发疯一样
Drives them crazy.

192
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,460
刚刚跟路口那个Richard出去了
She just left with Richard.

193
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,260
你有意思的话早点儿来嘛
You gotta move quickly.

194
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,100
没想到在一夜之间
I never dreamed

195
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:08,100
我居然被两个叫阿May的女人抛弃
two Mays could dump me in one night.

196
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,930
为了要平复我的创伤
To get over it,

197
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,010
我决定不再找叫阿May的女人
I resolve never to go out with another May.

198
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,940
喂?  Lulu啊?
Hello? Lulu?

199
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,010
我是阿武啊
This is Qiwu.

200
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,240
出来喝杯酒吧?
Want to come out for a drink?

201
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,810
睡着了?
You're in bed already?

202
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,180
这么早啊?  这么早你能睡得着吗?
How can you sleep this early?

203
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,190
睡得着啊
You were asleep?

204
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,560
那没事了  拜拜
Never mind. Bye.

205
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,500
喂  千子惠吗?
Hello? Chieko san?

206
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,500
你猜我是谁?
Guess who I am?

207
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:40,030
对了  我是阿武啊
Bingo!

208
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,630
出来喝杯咖啡怎样?
Want to come out for a coffee?

209
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,040
什么?  你老公不答应  你什么时候结婚了?
Your husband won't let you? When did you get married?

210
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,580
五年多?
Five years ago?

211
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,580
怎么我们五年多没见了吗?
We haven't seen each other in over five years?

212
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,840
女儿都两个了
You have two kids?

213
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,650
你开心就好
You're happy. That's great.

214
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,120
祝你幸福
Well, all the best.

215
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,990
拜拜
Bye.

216
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,800
喂  请问江秀惠在不在?
Is Kong Siu-Wai there?

217
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,800
我是何志武
This is He Qiwu.

218
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:19,570
小学四年级同班同学  坐你隔壁的那一个啊
We went to fourth grade together.

219
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,190
你记不记得啊?
You remember?

220
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,640
哈哈  不记得啊?
You don't?

221
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,840
没事了  拜拜
Doesn't matter. Bye.

222
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:06,560
那30罐凤梨罐头吃得我的胃非常不舒服
Those 30 cans of pineapple had left me feeling queasy,

223
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,780
所以我去了一家酒吧
so I went to a bar.

224
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,990
因为听说酒可以帮助消化
I'd heard alcohol can settle the stomach.

225
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,280
你没事吧?
Are you okay?

226
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,260
没事  没事  再给我一杯啊
Fine. Another double.

227
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,630
有一首歌叫作"日出时让恋爱终结"
There's a song called "Love Dies at Dawn."

228
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,290
我现在的心情就是这样
That's how I feel now.

229
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,530
怎么样才可以让我忘记阿May呢?
What can I do to forget May?

230
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,770
我跟我自己说
I tell myself,

231
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,210
从这一分钟开始  第一个进来的女人  我就会喜欢她
I'll fall in love with the first woman who walks in.

232
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,010
小姐  喝点什么?
What can I get you?

233
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,740
威士忌  谢谢
Whiskey, please.

234
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,570
我有一个预感  她一定会喜欢我
I have a feeling she'll like me,

235
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,070
可是为了保障我自己  我要问她一个问题
but just to be safe, I decide to ask her a question.

236
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:42,350
小姐  请问你喜不喜欢吃菠萝?
Excuse me, miss, do you like pineapple?

237
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,710
噢  她可能不是本地人
Maybe she's not Cantonese.

238
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,930
你喜欢菠萝吗?
Tell me, do you like pineapple?

239
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,190
你喜欢菠萝吗?
Do you like Pineapple?

240
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:07,510
小姐  请问你喜不喜欢吃凤梨?
Do you like pineapple, miss?

241
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:10,640
国语讲得还不错嘛
Your Mandarin's not bad.

242
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,110
噢  我台湾来的嘛  你呢?
I grew up in Taiwan. What about you?

243
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,980
我现在不想说话
I'm not in the mood to talk.

244
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,090
请你走开
Please leave me alone.

245
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,090
你不用说话没关系啊
We don't have to talk.

246
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,320
我可以坐在这边吗?
Could I just sit here?

247
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:27,930
这里那么多位子  你干嘛一定要坐我旁边呢?
There are lots of seats. Why do you have to sit next to me?

248
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:30,960
因为我看你  你很寂寞啊
I can tell you're lonely.

249
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,500
是吗?
Really?

250
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,200
是
Yes.

251
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:38,500
一个女人  这么晚了还戴墨镜  只为了三个理由
There are only three reasons a woman would wear shades this late.

252
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,040
第一个呢  就说明她是个瞎子
First, she's blind.

253
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:45,310
第二个呢  就说明她在耍帅  所以要戴墨镜
Second, she's a poseur.

254
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,150
第三个呢  就因为她失恋
Or third, she got jilted

255
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,550
因为她不想让人家看出来她哭过
and doesn't want people to see she's been crying.

256
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,720
那你觉得我是属于哪一种呢?
And which one am I?

257
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,480
失恋
The jilted woman.

258
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,490
其实没关系嘛
It's okay.

259
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,890
失恋很平常啊  何必哭成这样子呢?
It happens all the time. Why cry about it?

260
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,660
失恋我也试过啊
I've been there too.

261
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,570
呐  我失恋的时候呢  我就去跑
I usually go jogging.

262
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,940
然后跑跑跑  跑到满身大汗的
I run until I work up a sweat.

263
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,800
这样子呢  我就没有泪可以流了
Then there's no water left for tears.

264
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,240
真的  你要不要试试看跑步?
Wanna try it?

265
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:17,940
我今天已经跑了一个晚上了  我很疲倦
I've been running around all night. I'm exhausted.

266
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:21,050
如果你想找人陪你聊天的话
If you're looking to chat,

267
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,280
请你找别人好吗?
please find someone else.

268
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:27,180
我不是想找人聊天的
I don't particularly want to talk.

269
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,590
我只是想陪你
I just want to keep you company.

270
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,860
因为我了解失恋的感觉
I know how it feels to have your heart broken.

271
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:38,400
一个女人失恋的时候  最需要就是一个肩膀
A heartbroken woman needs a shoulder to lean on.

272
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:43,610
你可以把我当成是你男朋友也没有关系啊
You can pretend I'm your boyfriend if you want.

273
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,100
我没有男朋友
I don't have a boyfriend.

274
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,300
我也没有女朋友啊
And I don't have a girlfriend.

275
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,610
你今年几岁?
How old are you?

276
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,710
我啊  我两个钟头之前呢  是24岁
Two hours ago, I was still 24.

277
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,710
可是我现在已经25岁了
Now I'm 25.

278
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,520
我是不会喜欢你的
I won't like you.

279
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,590
不要说得这么肯定嘛
Don't be so sure.

280
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,460
搞不好你再给我多一点时间  你就会喜欢我  对不对?
Give me a chance. We might hit it off.

281
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:10,230
你喜不喜欢吃凤梨嘛?
Do you like pineapple?

282
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,530
我喜不喜欢吃凤梨关你什么事?
What business is that of yours?

283
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,260
因为我想多了解你啊
I'm just trying to learn more about you.

284
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,670
我以前交一个女朋友  我们在一起5年
I was involved with a girl for five years.

285
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,440
可是之后呢  她跟我分手
But then she dumped me.

286
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,410
因为她说我根本就不了解她
She said I didn't understand her.

287
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,950
所以我想多多了解你啊
So I want to get to know you.

288
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,120
你是不会了解我的
You'll never get to know me.

289
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:40,720
你不让我了解你没有关系啊  可是你可以了解我啊  对不对?
Fine. Then try to get to know me.

290
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,990
你喜欢什么样的男人?
What kind of man do you like?

291
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:51,970
其实了解一个人并不代表什么
Actually, really knowing someone doesn't mean anything.

292
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,570
人是会变的
People change.

293
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,580
今天他喜欢凤梨
A person may like pineapple today

294
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,010
明天他可以喜欢别的
and something else tomorrow.

295
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,780
先生  先生
Sir!

296
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,970
打烊了
We're closing up.

297
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,820
打烊了
They're closing.

298
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,290
要不要去跑步啊?
Wanna go jogging?

299
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:18,950
我  我想找个地方休息一下
I just want somewhere to rest.

300
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,040
我没有想到  她说的休息就是真正的休息
When she said "rest", I didn't think she actually meant it.

301
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:17,250
整个晚上  我看了两套粤语长片
That night, I watched two old movies on TV

302
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,720
吃了四次厨师沙拉
and had four chef's salads.

303
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:40,760
当天差不多快亮的时候  我知道我该走了
When the sun rose, I knew I had to go.

304
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:46,000
在我要走的时候  我帮她脱了鞋子
As I was leaving, I took off her shoes.

305
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:51,210
我记得我妈说过  如果女人穿高跟鞋睡觉
My mother used to say a woman's feet swell up

306
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,470
第二天脚会肿
if she sleeps in high heels.

307
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,060
她昨天晚上一定是走了很长的路
She must have walked a lot that night.

308
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:13,600
像她这样漂亮的女人  高跟鞋应该是要很干净的才对
Such a pretty woman should have clean shoes.

309
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:27,470
我是早上六点钟出生的
I was actually born at 6:00 a. m.,

310
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,010
还有两分钟我就25岁了
so I'll really be 25 two minutes from now.

311
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,240
换句话来讲
In other words,

312
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,310
我已经在这个世界上  经历了四分之一个世纪
I've spent a quarter of a century on this planet!

313
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:42,150
在这个历史性的时候  我去跑步了
To celebrate this historic moment, I go jogging.

314
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:47,430
我很成功地  让我身体里多余的水份蒸发掉
I'll get rid of my body's excess water.

315
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,420
我觉得很开心
It feels good.

316
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:56,070
要离开这个球场的时候  我留下了我的Call机
As I leave the track, I decide to ditch my pager.

317
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:00,440
因为我知道今天没有人再会Call我
I know very well no one's gonna call me today.

318
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,720
368复机
Account 368.

319
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,870
请说出密码
Password, please.

320
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,560
"爱你一万年"
"Love You for 10,000 Years."

321
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:01,300
你702号房间的朋友跟你说  "生日快乐"
Your friend in room 702 says happy birthday.

322
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,710
谢谢
Thank you.

323
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:08,280
在1994年的5月1号
On May 1, 1994,

324
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:12,050
有一个女人跟我讲了一声  "生日快乐"
a woman wishes me happy birthday.

325
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:17,150
因为这一句话  我会一直记住这个女人
Now I'll remember her all my life.

326
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:22,850
如果记忆也是一个罐头的话  我希望这罐罐头不会过期
If memories ever come in a can, I hope that can never expires.

327
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:28,690
如果一定要加一个日子的话  我希望它是一万年
If it has to have a shelf life, I hope it's 10,000 years.

328
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:46,200
给我一支烟
Give me a cigarette.

329
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,960
- 下雨了  - 是吗?
- It's raining. - Oh, yeah?

330
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:29,570
[期限: 1994年5月1日]

331
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,880
一杯可乐
A Coke, please.

332
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,190
哎  你又去跑步了?
Jogging again?

333
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:49,960
大男人一天到晚去跑步  这可不是办法
Running around isn't gonna solve anything.

334
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,980
阿菲呀  阿菲不错的
Listen, Faye's not bad either.

335
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,000
谁是阿菲啊?
Who's Faye?

336
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:59,040
啊  老朋友才告诉你  她今天才上班
Just started here today.

337
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:03,210
你要就快点  要不然又便宜Richard了
Make your move before Richard beats you to it.

338
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,090
- 可是我不喜欢男人  - 男人?
- I'm not into guys. - Guys?

339
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,560
让一让  让一让
Coming through!

340
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:18,770
我跟她最接近的时候  我们之间的距离只有0.01公分
That was the closest we ever got just 0.01 cm between us.

341
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,270
我对她一无所知
I knew nothing about her.

342
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:23,970
六个钟头之后
Six hours later,

343
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,270
她喜欢上了另外一个男人
she fell in love with another man.

344
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:44,850
一份厨师沙拉  谢谢
Chef's salad, please.

345
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,160
拿走还是在这儿吃的?
For here or to go?

346
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:49,730
拿走的
To go.

347
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,900
你新来的?  没见过你啊
You new here? I haven't seen you before.

348
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,440
你喜欢听这么吵的音乐啊?
You like listening to loud music?

349
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:06,780
对啊  吵一点挺好
Yes. The louder the better.

350
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,310
不用想那么多事啊
Keeps me from thinking so much.

351
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,520
你不喜欢想事情啊?
You don't like to think?

352
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,550
那你喜欢什么?
What do you like?

353
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,490
不知道  想起来再告诉你
I'll tell you when I find out.

354
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,790
你呢?
And what do you like?

355
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,430
厨师沙拉
Chef's salad.

356
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,060
老板  一份厨师沙拉
A chef's salad, boss.

357
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,070
又是厨师沙拉?
Chef's salad again?

358
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,170
每天晚上吃不烦啊
Aren't you tired of them yet?

359
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,430
- 买给别人吃的  - 女朋友啊?
- It's not for me. - Your girlfriend?

360
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:41,480
她爱吃厨师沙拉啊?
Is that her favorite?

361
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:45,270
买惯了嘛  她也没说她不爱吃
She never said it wasn't.

362
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:48,650
她是没说出来  你怎么知道她不想尝尝新东西呢?
Maybe she'd like something different for once.

363
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,080
炸鱼薯条  很好吃的
Try fish and chips. It's delicious.

364
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,310
万一她不喜欢吃怎么办?
What if she doesn't like it?

365
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:57,690
那么你就买一份厨师沙拉  再买一份炸鱼薯条
Get both and let her choose.

366
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,890
不就得了
You can't go wrong.

367
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:03,760
- 浪费钱  - 十几二十块嘛
- Isn't that wasting money? - It's not that much.

368
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:06,490
让她有个选择不好吗?
It's good to give her a choice.

369
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,200
好啊  一份厨师沙拉  一份炸鱼薯条
Okay. One chef's salad, one fish and chips.

370
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:11,840
好
All right!

371
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:16,780
谢谢
Thanks.

372
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:03,820
老板  一份炸鱼薯条
Fish and chips, please, boss.

373
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:05,520
对不对?
See?

374
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,860
我早说过她会爱吃  你不信?
I told you she'd like it.

375
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:09,620
就是嘛
You were right.

376
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,290
不爱吃厨师沙拉也不说
She never told me she didn't like chef's salad.

377
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:14,060
你又...
You never --

378
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,210
你又没有让她选择
You never gave her a choice.

379
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,470
有选择  她自然会说话啦
If you had, she might have told you.

380
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:29,710
反正换口味  今天晚上尝尝Pizza吧?
Anyway, now you broke the routine. Try pizza tonight.

381
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:33,050
Pizza?  不知道她喜不喜欢吃
I don't know if she'd like pizza.

382
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:38,880
还是那一招  一份炸鱼薯条  一份Pizza
Then do the same thing: Get both.

383
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,620
多花几十块嘛  别担心
It won't break the bank.

384
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:44,390
好吧
Okay.

385
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:53,670
怎么样?  今天晚上要不要尝点儿什么新的啊?
Want to try something different again?

386
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,600
热狗啊?  热狗不错啊
The hot dogs are good.

387
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,210
不用了  给我一杯咖啡
No, thanks. Just black coffee.

388
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:02,080
嗯?  你不买宵夜给女朋友吃了?
Nothing for your girlfriend?

389
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:03,710
她走了
She left.

390
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:05,380
为什么啊?
Why?

391
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,890
她说想换换口味
Said she wanted to try some new dishes.

392
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,150
也对
I guess she's right.

393
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:13,660
宵夜都那么多选择  何况男朋友
Plenty of choice in men, just like food.

394
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:19,760
好好的厨师沙拉嘛  换什么炸鱼薯条
I guess I should've stuck with the chef's salad.

395
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,830
小事情
It's no big deal.

396
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:26,840
她不换换口味  又怎么知道你是真材实料
She'll try someone else and see you're better.

397
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:31,170
早晚会回来找你的  你放心
She'll come running back. Don't worry.

398
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:32,710
谢谢
Thanks.

399
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:59,640
每一架飞机上面  一定有一位空中小姐是你想泡的
On every flight, there's one stewardess you long to seduce.

400
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:02,970
去年的这个时侯  我非常成功地
This time last year, at 25,000 feet,

401
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:05,980
在两万五千尺的高空上泡了一位
I actually seduced one.

402
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:19,970
我以为会跟她在一起很久
I thought we'd stay together for the long haul,

403
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:23,350
就像一架加满了油的飞机一样  可以飞得很远
flying like a jumbo jet on a full tank.

404
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,890
谁知道飞机中途转站
But there was an unexpected change of course.

405
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:13,530
给我一杯咖啡
Black coffee, please.

406
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,200
都一个星期了  她还没回来找你啊?
A week and she's not back?

407
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:19,000
让一下
Excuse me.

408

也许她在外面真的有很多选择吧
Maybe she does have lots of choices.

409
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:26,410
那你不要等了  她选择她的

你也换换口味嘛

411
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:31,950
每晚都喝咖啡  可不行啊
Black coffee every night's no good for you.

412
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,920
说换就换

413
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:36,610
慢慢来好了
Have to go slow.

00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:48,730
他说被大头钉扎伤了  要留在家里养伤
Said he got hurt by a pin. He's recuperating at home.

456
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:51,330

Hurt by a pin? What's he talking about?

457
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:58,860
她走了之后  家里很多东西都很伤心
Ever since she left, everything in the apartment is sad.

458
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,310
每天晚上  我都要安慰它们才能睡觉

459
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,840
你知不知道你瘦了?

以前你胖嘟嘟的

你看你  现在都扁了
Now look at yourself. You're so skinny.

462
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:17,160
何苦来的呢?  要对自己有信心才行
Have more confidence in yourself.

463
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,930
我叫你不要哭嘛  你要哭到什么时候啊?
I told you to stop crying. How long are you going to cry?

464
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:30,270
做人要坚强一点嘛
You have to be strong.

465

468
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:52,950
怎么不说话?
Why don't you say something?

469
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,130
别生她的气了
Don't be mad at her.

470
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:00,130
每个人都有不清醒的时候
We all have moments of doubt.

471
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:03,100
给她个机会
Give her a chance.

472
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,100
好不好?
Okay?

473
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,410
是不是很寂寞啊?
Feeling lonely?

474
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:13,210
才几天嘛  用得着这样
You're a real mess.

475
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,850
你冷啊?  我给你点温暖
You cold? I'll warm you up.

476
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:23,830
老板

让一下  让一下  对不起
Excuse me.

481
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,540
让一下  让一下  对不起  让一下  让一下

什么好了?
Better?

485
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,450
他不是说你被大头钉扎伤了啊
He said you got hurt by a pin.

486
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:55,620
听他瞎掰
Don't listen to his nonsense.

487
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:59,160
怎么最近老没见你啊?
You haven't been around much lately.

488
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:02,560
换早班了  现在巡这一区
I changed shifts. I'm on this beat now.

489
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:03,860

490
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:06,370
- 要不要我帮忙啊?  - 行啊
- Want some help? - Sure.

491
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:11,500

492
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:18,050
哇  真够重的
It's so heavy!

493
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:20,240
这算轻的了
It's light today.

494
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:23,250
你的工作蛮辛苦的嘛
Your job must be hard.

495
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:26,140
打工就这么辛苦呗
Work's never fun.

496
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:29,020
为什么你会做这份工?
Why'd you take this job?

497
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:32,280
我表哥请不着人
My cousin couldn't find anyone else.

498
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:35,190
让我来帮忙  就暂时帮他了
I'm just helping out for now.

499
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:37,530
那你以前做什么?
What did you do before?

500

我存钱呢
I'm saving up.

502
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,870
读书啊?
To go to school?

503
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:47,380
没想过
Never thought of that.

504
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:49,510
我就是想玩
I just want to enjoy life.

505
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:51,440
打算去哪里玩?
How? Where?

506
00:59:51,610 --> 00:59:53,340
随便呀
Anywhere.

507
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,070
加州
Maybe California.

508
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:59,710
加州?  加州好玩吗?
California? Is it fun there?

509
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:05,050
不知道  不好玩就到别的地方去
I said maybe. If it's not, I can move on.

510
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,090
你喜欢到处去玩啊?
You like to travel?

511
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:10,830
你不喜欢啊?
Don't you?

512
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,030
我无所谓  去也行  不去也行
I can take it or leave it.

513
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:21,440
那咱们约着一起去吧  我的钱就快存够了
You can come with me. I almost have enough.

514
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,110
改天再说吧
We'll see.

515
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:28,280
你这人怎么老这样啊?
Are you always like this?

516
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:31,250
那封信你到现在也没拿
You never came to get that letter.

517
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:34,320
我没空嘛
I've been busy.

518
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:38,590
这样吧  你把你的地址告诉我  我寄给你
Give me your address. I'll mail it.

519
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,030
免得丢了
Otherwise it'll get lost.

520
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:43,120
好啊
Okay.

521
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:11,720
就是这个地址?  咦?  你家挺近的啊?
You live close by.

522
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:16,520
是呀  就在前面有空上来坐啊
Yeah, right down there. Drop by sometime.

523
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,290

I will.

524
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:22,570
来  继续吧
Well, let's keep going.

525
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:25,100
哇  你出了那么多汗
You're really sweating.

526
01:01:25,270 --> 01:01:27,040
你还行吗?
Sure you can manage?

527
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,110
行  没问题
I'm fine.

528
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:26,400
拜托  你不要老做白日梦了
Stop daydreaming, will you?

529
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:28,700
你以为你会唱两句就是歌星吗?
Think you're a rock star?

530
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:32,810
工作不做  老是拿着红萝卜当麦克风
You've been fooling around with that all day.

531
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:35,030
这是人家要来吃的
Who'd wanna eat it now?

532
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:37,470
要拿  拿卷卫生纸去
Use a toilet roll or something.

533
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:45,610
你呀你呀
You too!

534
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:48,390
我  我没做梦啊
I'm not daydreaming.

535
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:51,620
对对  你没做梦  你这是在梦游
That's right. You're sleepwalking!

536
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:57,090
对  梦游  梦游呗
That's right. I'm sleepwalking.

537
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,190
那就梦游吧
Whatever you say.

538
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:03,430
游吧
I'm sleepwalking.

539
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:07,570
那天下午我做了个梦
I had a dream that afternoon.

540
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,870
我好像是上他家去了
It seemed I was in his apartment

541
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:13,380
离开的时候  我以为我会醒过来
and that I'd wake up when I left.

542
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:15,880
谁知道  有的梦是怎么样都不会醒的
I didn't know you never wake up from some dreams.

543
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:26,820
有时候  我会回家吃饭
Some days I go home for lunch,

544
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,520
因为每一次回来我都可以有一个希望
because there's always a chance ...

545
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:33,890
我知道你回来了
I know you're in there.

546
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,090
你快点出来啊
Come on out.

547
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:39,900
我数三下
I'll count to three.

548
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,540
一
One ...

549
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:44,440
二
two ...

550
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:45,640
三
three!

551
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:49,150
她以前很喜欢从衣柜里跳出来吓我
She used to jump out and scare me,

552
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:51,790
可是最近少多了
but she hasn't done it much recently.

553
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:55,120
哼  说的也是  玩得多也会厌啊
I guess games get old after a while.

554
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:06,730
那她会不会藏在厕所呢?
Maybe she's hiding in the bathroom.

555
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:08,090
喂
Hello.

556
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:12,230
喂
Hello!

557
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:30,580
傻瓜
Dummy.

558
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:33,520
- 你的叉烧饭  - 谢谢
- Roast pork and rice. - Thanks.

559
01:05:35,790 --> 01:05:37,950
让一下  让一下  让...
Excuse me.

560
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:41,190
嗨
Hi.

561
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:44,520
- 又在这吃饭啊?  - 是啊
- Eating here again, huh? - Yes.

562
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:49,760
你还没吃完了吗?
Will you be here a while?

563
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:52,730
什么事啊?
Why?

564
01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:55,040
啊?  没事  没什么
No reason.

565
01:05:59,210 --> 01:06:00,840
你去哪里呀?
Where are you going?

566
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:03,710
我忘了拿点东西  得回去拿一下
I forgot something.

567
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:07,920
喂  对了  你那封信我还没寄呢
Oh, I still haven't mailed your letter.

568
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:09,680
没关系  有空再寄吧
No hurry.

569
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:12,880
没关系啊?  那等我有空再说吧
All right. I'll get around to it.

570
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:21,360
你怎么又搬回来了?
Why are you back?

571
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:25,130
我得赶交电费  先放这一会儿
I have to pay the electricity bill. Can I leave this here?

572
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:32,210
喂  表哥啊?
Hello? Cousin?

573
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:34,780
我现在还在菜市场了
I'm still at the market.

574
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:38,880
对啊  我这下大雨
It's pouring rain here.

575
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:42,820
特大  你听听
It's pouring. Listen.

576
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:46,430
真的假的?  我们这里出大太阳呢
What are you talking about? It's sunny over here.

577
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:50,160
地区性雷阵雨吧
Really? Must be a local shower.

578
01:06:50,330 --> 01:06:52,270
行了  雨停了  我就马上回来了
I'll be back when it stops.

579
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:53,900
记住把电费交了
Don't forget the electricity bill.

580
01:06:54,070 --> 01:06:55,660
知道了  知道了
I won't.

581
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:42,980
我走了
I'm going now.

582
01:08:43,150 --> 01:08:45,050
行了  行了  知道了
It's okay.

583
01:08:45,210 --> 01:08:46,740
我再来看你们  拜拜
I'll be back to see you soon.

584
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,170
拜
Bye.

585
01:09:11,970 --> 01:09:13,700
请你吃的
These are for you.

586
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:18,270
干嘛买那么多荔枝啊?
Why all the lychees?

587
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:20,550
我串门去
They're for a friend.

588
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:27,880
你跑哪儿去了?
Where are you?

589
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,060
我不是交电费嘛
Paying the electricity bill.

590
01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:31,950
要交这么久啊?
All this time?

591
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:35,430
对呀  人特多  挤都挤不过去
It's packed here. I can hardly get in the store.

592
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,090
我看且得交呢
I have to wait in line.

593
01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:41,130
怎么可能每天都那么多人呐?  你交了好几天了
How come it's always so crowded? You've been trying for days.

594
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:45,570
我也没办法啊
I don't want to.

595
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:51,000
尽量吧  今天交不了  明天再来呗
I'm doing my best. Should I try again tomorrow?

596
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:54,410
不要了  这家人太多  你换别的地方去
Try another store.

597
01:09:55,150 --> 01:09:56,910
换别的地方去?
Another store?

598
01:09:57,890 --> 01:10:01,010
那我换了啊  我真的换了啊
Okay. You're sure?

599
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:05,000
你好
Hello.

600
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,860
嗨  你去逛公司啊?
Been shopping?

601
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:10,800
没有  我在帮一个朋友装修嘛
A friend is redecorating his place.

602
01:10:11,070 --> 01:10:14,160
- 你很忙啊  - 对啊  我事特多
- You sure are busy. - I certainly am.

603
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:19,540
还喝咖啡呢?  别喝那么多  伤身体
Black coffee again. It's bad for you.

604
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:22,800
晚上睡不着多喝点水
If you can't sleep at night, drink water.

605
01:10:56,750 --> 01:11:00,340
梦中人
Man in my dreams

606
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:03,950
一分钟抱紧
I hold you tight for a minute

607
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:07,590
接十分钟的吻
And kiss you for hours

608
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:15,350
陌生人
Stranger

609
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,190
怎样走进内心
You stole into my heart

610
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:23,000
制造这次兴奋
And set it all awhirl

611
01:11:25,870 --> 01:11:29,570
我仿似跟你热恋过
I've been in love with you before

612
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:32,870
和你未似现在这样近
But never felt so close to you as now

613
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:37,410
思想开始过份
My thoughts careen out of control

614
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:44,790
为何突然袭击我
Why have you taken me by storm

615
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:48,550
来进入我闷透梦窝
Bursting into my dreary dreams

616
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:52,690
激起一股震撼
Sending shock waves in every direction

617
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:16,020
梦中人
Man in my dreams

618
01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:19,680
多么想变真
I want you to be real

619
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:23,760
我在心里不禁
My heart can no longer resist

620
01:12:27,570 --> 01:12:31,440
梦中嫱
Searching in my dreams

621
01:12:31,610 --> 01:12:34,130
这分钟我在等
At this minute I'm waiting

622
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:38,500
你万分钟的吻
To kiss you for hours

623
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:47,150
喂  是我啊
Hi, it's me.

624
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:50,610
班机回香港了  要不要把位子留给你啊?
The plane's back in Hong Kong. Want to make a reservation?

625
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:53,780
我还是以前的那个电话  打给我吧  拜拜
I'm at the same number. Call me. Bye-bye.

626
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:49,140
哇  你的头发多漂亮啊  留了一些日子了吧?
Nice hair! Did it take long to grow?

627
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:51,370
关你什么事啊  神经病
None of your business.

628
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:56,610
够骚的啊?
Kind of a flirt, isn't she?

629
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:58,270
是啊
I guess so.

630
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,750
怎么了?
What is it?

631
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:06,590
没什么  不  你跟她挺熟的?
Have you known her long?

632
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,230
不是啊
No.

633
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:19,570
有一天  我突然心血来潮  我有一个感觉  她好像回来了
One day I had this sudden feeling she was back.

634
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:56,000
不知道是我忘了关水龙头
Did I leave the faucet running,

635
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:59,010
还是房子越来越有感情?
or is the apartment getting more weepy?

636
01:15:59,410 --> 01:16:01,680
我一直以为它是最坚强的
I thought it would cope all right.

637
01:16:01,850 --> 01:16:03,820
没想到它会哭得最厉害
I didn't expect it to weep this much.

638
01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:08,050
一个人哭  你只需要给他一包纸巾
When people cry, you just give them a tissue.

639
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:12,120
可是一间房子哭  你可要多做很多功夫
But when an apartment cries, it's a lot of work to mop it up.

640
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:33,580
你怎么会在这儿啊?
What are you doing here?

641
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:36,480
- 这里是我的家  我当然在这里  - 你的家?
- I live here. - You live here?

642
01:16:36,650 --> 01:16:38,550
你来这儿干什么?
What are you doing here?

643
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,850
我没事  我买金鱼呗
I came to buy goldfish.

644
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:44,350
- 这里有金鱼卖吗?  - 没有啊
- Someone around here sell goldfish? - No.

645
01:16:44,530 --> 01:16:47,760
- 那你说你来买金鱼?  - 对啊
Then why come to buy goldfish? - Yes.

646
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:48,800
你到底是买金鱼还是卖金鱼的?
You buying or selling?

647
01:16:48,850 --> 01:16:50,860
什么呀?  你说什么呢?  我就是买金鱼呗
What? No -- I mean, I'm buying.

648
01:16:51,330 --> 01:16:55,200
你问什么呀  我不知道  你别吓唬我
Stop it! I forget everything when I'm scared.

649
01:16:55,370 --> 01:16:56,560
你怕什么?
Why are you scared?

650
01:16:56,740 --> 01:16:59,870
我怕你呗  我看见你就害怕
I got scared when I saw you here.

651
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:01,630
那我走了
I'm going now.

652
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:09,370
你说要走  还站在这儿  还不走?
You said you were going. Well?

653
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:13,820
我动不了  我这腿能动我不早走了吗?
I can't move my legs. I'd go if I could.

654
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:15,590
你是不是抽筋了?
You have a cramp?

655
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,730
我不知道  我没抽过筋
I don't know. It's never happened before.

656
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:21,550
你还是进来坐一会儿吧  来啊
Maybe you should come in and sit down.

657
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:35,410
每一次她回来  我都会为她按摩小腿
When she'd return from a long flight, I'd massage her legs.

658
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:37,980
因为做空姐真的很辛苦
Being a stewardess is a tough job.

659
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:40,810
女人的小腿是最性感的
I've always found women's legs sexy.

660
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:44,780
自从她走了之后  我很久没有接触过了
But I haven't touched any since she left.

661
01:17:52,490 --> 01:17:55,160
- 好一点没有?  - 好一点儿了
- Better? - I guess.

662
01:17:55,330 --> 01:17:57,460
- 我能走了吧?  - 再坐一会儿
- Can I go now? - Stay a while longer.

663
01:17:58,030 --> 01:17:59,560
给你听首歌
I'll put on some music.

664
01:18:22,390 --> 01:18:24,480
你喜欢这首歌啊?
You like this song too?

665
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:27,750
我无所谓  我女朋友喜欢它
Not really. My girlfriend liked it.

666
01:18:31,230 --> 01:18:33,930
你肯定你女朋友喜欢这首歌?
She really liked this song?

667
01:18:34,870 --> 01:18:36,170
是呀
Yes.

668
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:47,680
我知道他女朋友喜欢的不是这首歌
I know it isn't true.

669
01:18:48,450 --> 01:18:51,510
因为这张唱片是我前几天梦游的时候留在这儿的
That's my CD. I left it here a few days ago.

670
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:56,710
我开始怀疑梦游是否会传染?
I'm starting to wonder: Can sleepwalking be contagious?

671
01:18:57,130 --> 01:18:59,180
可能因为刚才太紧张了吧
I guess I've been too nervous.

672
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,790
坐一坐就睡着了
After a while, I fell asleep.

673
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:27,750
那天下午  那个女孩子在我家里睡着了
The girl fell asleep in my place that afternoon.

674
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:30,950
本来我想叫她起床
I thought about waking her up,

675
01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:33,220
不知道为什么我没有这么做
but for some reason I didn't.

676
01:20:05,630 --> 01:20:06,720
糟了  糟了
Oh, no!

677
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:12,830
当心着火  小心啊
Watch out for the flames.

678
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,130
小心那些蜡烛啊
Make sure those candles are secure.

679
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:24,040
我真不明白你最近做什么?
What's gotten into you lately?

680
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:27,610
电费也不交  好了吧  现在电也被人剪了
Why didn't you pay the electricity bill?

681
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:29,940
你每天下午都去哪儿了?
Where have you been going every day?

682
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,710
我看病去了
I went to see the doctor.

683
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:36,390
看医生?  我怎么没见你吃药啊?
The doctor? I haven't seen you taking any medicine.

684
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:39,250
我吃了啊  你没看见嘛
You just didn't notice.

685
01:20:39,530 --> 01:20:43,620
是  我没注意  那么医生说你什么时候会好呀?
Did he say when you'd get better?

686
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:46,590
快了  就快好了
Should be any day now.

687
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:52,510
祝你生日快乐
Happy birthday to you.

688
01:20:52,610 --> 01:20:54,230
神经病
You're crazy!

689
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:09,790
不知道是不是因为换季
Maybe it's the change of season,

690
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,220
我觉得自己变了很多
but lately I've changed a lot.

691
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:14,620
我的观察力强了
I've become more observant.

692
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,530
开始注意一些我平常不会注意的事情
I notice things I used to take for granted.

693
01:21:21,370 --> 01:21:23,860
怎么番茄青鱼有生鱼的味道?
Even the sardines taste different.

694
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:20,460
你不要自暴自弃嘛
You mustn't let yourself go.

695
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:26,460
前阵子看你还好好的  怎么一下子胖这么多啊?
You were fine before. Now you've suddenly put on weight.

696
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:32,100
她虽然不在  你还得见人啊
She left, but you have to carry on.

697
01:22:33,610 --> 01:22:36,470
不要再放纵自己了  减肥
You can't go on indulging yourself.

698
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,210
我早就想骂你了
You know, I have to tell you:

699
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:41,840
你变了  你知不知道?
You've totally changed.

700
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:44,820
做人要有性格嘛
You can't just change personality like this.

701
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:48,980
就算她真的不回来  你也不要改变你自己啊
Her walking out is no excuse.

702
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:53,320
好好反省反省
I want you to think about that.

703
01:22:59,070 --> 01:23:02,000
看着它哭的时候  我很开心
It was a relief when I saw it crying.

704
01:23:02,170 --> 01:23:04,970
因为它外表好像改变了
It may look different on the outside,

705
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:07,900
可是它的本质没有变
but it's still true to itself.

706
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,840
它依然是条感情丰富的毛巾
It's still a very emotional towel.

707
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:12,340
觉不觉得我开朗了?
Have you noticed I've perked up?

708
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:15,480
我突然觉得什么东西都好看多了
Things are starting to look better.

709
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:18,410
以前我觉得你很笨
You used to look sorta dumb,

710
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:21,780
现在看起来蛮可爱的
but now you're looking quite cute.

711
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:25,120
别把自己弄得那么脏嘛
But you mustn't let yourself get so dirty.

712
01:23:25,290 --> 01:23:27,990
以前白白的多好啊
You used to be so clean and white.

713
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:30,900
现在弄得黄黄的
Now you've turned all yellow.

714
01:23:31,070 --> 01:23:34,000
你看你  还弄那么多疤
Look at these scars.

715
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:38,940
跟别人打架了?  啊?
Have you been getting in fights?

716
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:46,780
你怎么躲在这里啊?
Why were you hiding in there?

717
01:23:48,050 --> 01:23:50,310
知不知道我找你多久了?
I've been looking all over for you.

718
01:23:51,150 --> 01:23:53,750
你躲起来没有用啊
What's the point of hiding?

719
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:56,410
要面对现实才行
You have to face reality.

720
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,490
哇噻  发霉了
You're all moldy.

721
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:05,890
明天吧
Tell you what. I'm not busy tomorrow.

722
01:24:06,230 --> 01:24:08,360
明天我有空带你晒太阳
I'll take you out for some sun.

723
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,310
你怎么会在我家里啊?
What are you doing in my apartment?

724
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,710
不是你叫我有空到你家来坐的吗?
You said to drop by!

725
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:05,160
快开门啊  不然我撞门了啊
Open up or I'll break the door down!

726
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:38,720
喂  有人找你啊
There's someone looking for you.

727
01:25:38,890 --> 01:25:40,520
- 找我?  - 是啊
- Me? - Yeah.

728
01:25:46,170 --> 01:25:49,400
- 你怎么会在这儿?  - 我来拿封信
- What do you want? - I've come for my letter.

729
01:25:49,570 --> 01:25:51,660
什么信啊?  你问老板啊
What letter? Ask the boss.

730
01:25:52,570 --> 01:25:55,130
问我干嘛?  在你那儿嘛
You were keeping it.

731
01:25:55,310 --> 01:25:57,040
老板说在你那儿
He said you had it.

732
01:25:57,210 --> 01:25:58,440
在我这儿?
I do?

733
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:02,070
在我这儿吗?
I have it?

734
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:03,880
对了
Oh, right.

735
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:11,120
我怕丢了  我帮你收起来了  我没有看过啊
I was afraid someone might take it. I didn't read it.

736
01:26:15,930 --> 01:26:16,990
谢谢你啊
Thanks.

737
01:26:19,430 --> 01:26:21,870
明天晚上有没有空?
Are you free tomorrow night?

738
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:24,000
干嘛问我明天晚上有没有空?
Why do you ask?

739
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:26,470
- 想约你出去  - 干嘛约我出去?
- I want to ask you out. - On a date?

740
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:29,070
老板说你明天晚上不用上班
The boss says you're off tomorrow.

741
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:32,970
不上班就得跟你出去啊?
So I have to go on a date?

742
01:26:33,150 --> 01:26:35,010
你考虑一下
Think it over.

743
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:39,950
明天晚上八点  在对面那家"加州"等你
I'll meet you across the street at the California at 8:00.

744
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:44,920
这首歌不适合你听
That music's not your style.

745
01:26:45,090 --> 01:26:46,890
听这首
Listen to this.

746
01:26:59,770 --> 01:27:01,540
完了  完了
Damn it!

747
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:05,540
完了  完了  完了
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

748
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,710
喂  663泡妞真有一套啊
No. 663 is a smooth operator.

749
01:27:11,890 --> 01:27:14,820
- 老板  你要学学663  - 神经病
- It's 663. - Whatever it is!

750
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:23,060
稍等
Wait!

751
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:30,330
- 加酱汁吗?  - 好的
- Chilli sauce? - Okay.

752
01:27:35,110 --> 01:27:37,510
- 我的可乐呢?  - 可乐  没有杯子啊
- Where's my Coke? - I'm out of cups!

753
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:50,620
那天下午我在家里大扫除
I gave my place a thorough cleaning that afternoon.

754
01:27:50,790 --> 01:27:54,660
我好像在清理跑道  准备第二架飞机降落
It was like clearing the runway for another plane to land.

755
01:28:33,970 --> 01:28:36,460
那天晚上我早就到了"加州"
I got to the California really early that night.

756
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:38,800
因为我不知道飞机会不会Delay
I half expected a flight delay,

757
01:28:38,970 --> 01:28:41,240
我换了十块钱零钱
so I got some loose change.

758
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:54,680
喂  麻烦你帮我换零钱
Change, please.

759
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:17,040
半个钟头后  我又换了十块钱零钱
Half an hour later, I broke another $10 bill.

760
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:20,910
我开始有预感那班飞机已经Cancel了
I started thinking maybe the flight was canceled.

761
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:46,200
她不会来了
She isn't coming.

762
01:29:46,370 --> 01:29:49,100
她叫我把这封信交给你
She asked me to give you this.

763
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:53,710
用不着那么失望
Don't look so down.

764
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:57,010
泡不上她  可以泡别人嘛  对不对?
She didn't work out, so try another girl.

765
01:29:57,180 --> 01:30:00,980
阿May明天又回来做了  泡阿May吧
May's coming back tomorrow. Give her a try.

766
01:30:01,490 --> 01:30:04,510
- 她人呢?  - 她辞职了
- Where is she? - She quit.

767
01:30:04,690 --> 01:30:06,920
她说去什么  加州什么的
Said she was going to California.

768
01:30:08,060 --> 01:30:09,390
我走了
That's all.

769
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:11,160
谢谢
Thanks.

770
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,160
我没看那封信
I didn't read the letter.

771
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:21,770
因为有些事情需要时间去接受
Some things take time to sink in.

772
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:24,640
老板走了之后
After the snack-bar manager left,

773
01:30:24,810 --> 01:30:27,140
我开始跟啤酒瓶讲话
I started talking to the beer bottles.

774
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:29,510
你失望了?
Disappointed?

775
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:31,850
不会啊
Not really.

776
01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:36,080
回家睡觉吧  她不会来了
Go home to bed. She's not coming.

777
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,900
其实她不是没有来
Actually, she wasn't a no-show that night.

778
01:30:49,070 --> 01:30:51,260
只是走错了地方
She just got the place wrong.

779
01:30:51,970 --> 01:30:54,100
那天晚上我们大家都在加州
We were in different Californias

780
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:57,370
只不过我们之间相差了15个钟头
15 hours apart.

781
01:30:58,350 --> 01:31:01,870
现在是她那边早上11点
It must be 11:00 a. m. over there now.

782
01:31:03,050 --> 01:31:06,610
不知道今天晚上8点  她会不会记得约了我呢
I wonder if she'll remember our 8:00 p. m. date here.

783
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:21,960
嗨
Hi.

784
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,170
这么巧啊
What a coincidence!

785
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:29,800
不用值班啊?
Not on duty tonight?

786
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,640
放假
That's right.

787
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:34,870
你好吗?
How are you?

788
01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:37,310
还不错  你呢?
Fine. And you?

789
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:39,020
很好啊
I'm okay.

790
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:41,920
一个人?
You alone?

791
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:45,120
不是  跟朋友
No, I'm with a friend.

792
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:48,790
很配啊
He's your type.

793
01:31:49,630 --> 01:31:52,220
你还有东西在我家里
You still have stuff at my place.

794
01:31:52,630 --> 01:31:54,030
有空上来拿吧
Come get it sometime.

795
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:57,500
我不要了  帮我丢掉了吧
That's all right. Just throw it out.

796
01:32:00,210 --> 01:32:01,730
好
All right.

797
01:32:05,650 --> 01:32:07,240
我要走了
I gotta go.

798
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:12,920
我还是比较想看你穿制服
I still think you look better in uniform.

799
01:32:13,090 --> 01:32:14,380
你也是
So do you.

800
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:15,950
- 拜  - 拜
- Bye. - Bye.

801
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:20,220
哎  你买了东西  还没给钱呐
Hey, you didn't pay.

802
01:32:20,390 --> 01:32:21,660
你帮我给吧
You pay for me.

803
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:54,960
- 多少钱?  谢谢  - 262元
- How much is it? - $262

804
01:33:04,630 --> 01:33:05,750
谢谢
Thanks.

805
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:41,560
那天晚上我收到一张登机证  时间是一年以后
The letter turned out to be a boarding pass dated for one year later,

806
01:34:42,070 --> 01:34:46,270
至于地点我一直没有看清楚
but I couldn't make out the destination.

807
01:34:48,230 --> 01:34:50,220
[经济位  663先生]

808
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,910
其实那天我去了
I actually did show up that evening.

809
01:35:01,090 --> 01:35:04,680
我知道八点的时候人多  我七点一刻就到了
I knew it would get crowded, so I got there at 7:15.

810
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:07,890
那天的雨特大
It was pouring outside.

811
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:12,430
看着窗户外边  我看见了下雨的加州
Watching through the window, I saw a rainy California.

812
01:35:13,570 --> 01:35:17,230
我特想知道  另外一个加州是否阳光明媚?
I needed to know if the other California was warm and sunny.

813
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:19,870
所以我给了自己一年的时间
I decided to give myself one year.

814
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:25,280
今天和那天一样那么大雨
Tonight it's raining as hard as it was then.

815
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:27,580
望着窗户外边儿
Looking out this window,

816
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:30,150
我只是想着一个人
there's just one person in my thoughts.

817
01:35:31,650 --> 01:35:34,210
不知道他到底打开那封信没有?
I wonder if he ever opened my letter.

818
01:36:30,180 --> 01:36:32,040
你怎么会在这儿啊?
What are you doing here?

819
01:36:36,220 --> 01:36:38,650
喂  你怎么会在这儿?
Hey! What are you doing here?

820
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:40,610
怎么是你啊?
Is that really you?

821
01:36:41,220 --> 01:36:43,710
你干嘛?
Yeah. What are you doing here?

822
01:36:43,890 --> 01:36:45,120
装修啊
Renovating.

823
01:36:45,590 --> 01:36:47,180
装修?
Renovating?

824
01:36:48,090 --> 01:36:49,720
我表哥呢?
