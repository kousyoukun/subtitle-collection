we move closer to the light that awaits us.

into that instantaneous eternity right now?"

12
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:54,967
It's, like, let's say you love peppermint ice cream.

13
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:57,231
And they say, "Well, you can have peppermint ice cream,

14
00:00:57,274 --> 00:01:01,322
but only if you wait like 75 or 80 years." Hm.

15
00:01:01,365 --> 00:01:03,411
But then you look and there's that whole tub of,

00:01:03,454 --> 00:01:06,762
pile of peppermint ice cream, the hog-and-dance stuff,

17
00:01:06,805 --> 00:01:10,113
the expensive stuff, right there in the freezer.

00:01:10,157 --> 00:01:12,550
What are you gonna do? You're just gonna look at it?

19
00:01:12,594 --> 00:01:15,727
No. You're gonna eat it, right?

Yeah, well, there wasn't one in the box.

00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:37,521
Cute. Okay, that's great. Well...

47
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:38,914
Hey, how was your first day?

00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:40,394
Oh, it was, it was really good, actually.

65
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:13,035
Well, some very serious progress on the job front.

66
00:04:13,078 --> 00:04:14,297

Yeah, of course we did.

116
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,044

00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,163
What do we do?

147
00:08:35,863 --> 00:08:38,779
Okay, Wallace, enough!

148
00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:41,564
I-i-it's photographed. He's standing still.

00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:44,828
Goddammit! That flash gives me migraines.

150
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:47,875
You need 900 pictures? Are you makin' a 3D model?

151
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:52,836
All right, I'm gonna need to take your statements.

152
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,011
Just tell me everything that you know

153
00:08:54,055 --> 00:08:56,884
in your own words, Mr., uh...

154
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:59,060
Boyd. Paul Boyd.

155
00:08:59,103 --> 00:09:00,278
And you're Mrs. Boyd?

156
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:01,976
Oh, no, we're, we're not married.

157
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:05,501
Claire and I need to get our things sorted.

158
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,850
Mm.

159
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:20,516
All right. You kids have fun.

160
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,520
Wait a second. A guy just killed himself in our bathtub.

161
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,349
-Yeah. -Why?

162
00:09:30,526 --> 00:09:33,355
From time to time, members of a deranged cult

163
00:09:33,398 --> 00:09:34,791
break and enter into this dwelling

164
00:09:34,835 --> 00:09:36,445
in order to commit self-murder.

165
00:09:36,488 --> 00:09:37,925
Did the super not go over this with you

166
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:39,056
when you looked at the apartment?

167
00:09:40,144 --> 00:09:42,407
Knock, knock! Hi!

168
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:44,584
Hello, Beatrice. You're looking wonderful.

169
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:46,586
And you are looking great, Bloyce.

170
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:47,891
-Stop it.

171
00:09:47,935 --> 00:09:51,068
-Oh, here you go. -Oh, what's this?

172
00:09:51,112 --> 00:09:53,941
Oh, I always buy my tenants a carrot cake

173
00:09:53,984 --> 00:09:57,509
for their first tub death. It's just a little tradition.

174
00:09:57,553 --> 00:10:00,774
-"Their first tub death?" -Save me a piece.

175
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:03,820
I'm making fish sticks later.

176
00:10:03,864 --> 00:10:05,648
Look, honestly, these cultist

177
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:07,171
t-they're basically harmless.

178
00:10:07,215 --> 00:10:09,783
Their only goal is an exit strategy.

179
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,352
Are they that different? What am I doing?

180
00:10:14,396 --> 00:10:15,919
I really do have to go.

181
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:18,139
Hey! You can't just leave.

182
00:10:18,182 --> 00:10:20,532
We're totally exposed here.

183
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:22,317
You're totally exposed?

184
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,886
I'm the one that has to clean up this mess night after night.

185
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:28,497
Do you think this is how I planned to spend my evening?

186
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,674
I'm planned to be home working on my screenplay.

187
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:33,981
I just got a note that the detective character doesn't have

188
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:36,331
enough conflict. I'm a detective.

189
00:10:36,374 --> 00:10:38,768
It's a screenplay about a detective.

190
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:40,378
There's conflict.

191
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:43,207
This industry is bullshit.

192
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:47,647
The point is, instead, I'm here.

193
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,345
More often then you guys, by the way.

194
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:53,304
Good luck.

195
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:56,786
What do we do now?

196
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,223
If I were you, I'd move!

197
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:13,020
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

198
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:16,023
Look on the bright side.

199
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:18,678
Maybe now we can try Winnipeg.

Mm...

208
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:21,017
Claire.

209
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:26,980
Come to me, my child.

210
00:13:35,597 --> 00:13:37,555
Claire.

211
00:13:44,562 --> 00:13:46,913
Yeah, that's it.

212
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:56,531
Ah, yeah.

213
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,390
Wake up! Wake up, Paul! Wake up!

214
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:31,435
-Come on. -I'm up, I'm up, I'm up...

215
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:33,916
I was up all night and I had a revelation.

216
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,396
-You did? What is it? -Yeah.

217
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:37,746
We aren't going anywhere.

218
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:39,095
-We're not? -No.

219
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:41,097
-We're not? -No, because we're in LA.

220
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:42,969
It's like the land of, of movie stars

221
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:44,884
and fancy cars, you know?

222
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:46,798
There's like five places alone on this block

223
00:14:46,842 --> 00:14:48,931
where you can get kombucha.

224
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:50,715
What's that? What is kombucha?

225
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:53,022
I don't even know. A-and that's my point.

226
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:55,024
You know, 'cause if we're gonna be LA-ians,

227
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:57,679
we-we gotta, we gotta adapt, right?

228
00:14:57,722 --> 00:14:59,811
Yeah, yes, yes, I do know,

229
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:02,771
what you, like a, mm, like an adaptation.

230
00:15:02,814 --> 00:15:04,991
Yes, and we-we're, we're not just gonna run away

231
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:07,863
because some idiots wanna spill their guts in our bathtub.

232
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,910
No, no. This is our dream, this is our destiny.

233
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:13,390
Yes, I don't wanna run, Claire.

234
00:15:13,434 --> 00:15:15,958
I'm, I'm... Like you always say, I'm lazy.

235
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:19,179
We are strong and we are, we are adaptable

236
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:22,051
and we are, we are Los Angelenos.

237
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:25,663
Oh, gosh, dang it. I love you.

238
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:28,188
-I love you. -I love you, too.

239
00:15:28,231 --> 00:15:29,667
-I love you, Claire.

240
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:31,626
-Let me go back to bed, though. -Oh, no.

241
00:15:34,237 --> 00:15:37,675
Claire, this meeting started 15 minutes ago.

242
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:41,636
I am so sorry, some guy broke into our apartment last night

243
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,333
and then committed suicide in the bathtub.

244
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:44,987
I-I think he was like, part of some cult.

245
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:46,336
The cult of Storsh.

246
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,035
You're living in the Tabula Building? Why?

247
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:51,254
Great location, it's close to freeways.

248
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:53,996
Moving on. Meegan Nordheim.

249
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,000
You all know her, star of the reality show Meal Ticket,

250
00:15:58,044 --> 00:15:59,915
stands to inherit half a billion dollars

251
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,918
from insecticide king, Armund Nordheim,

252
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,095
who is currently 96 years old

253
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:08,141
and counting.

254
00:16:08,184 --> 00:16:10,795
And she is now running for congress

255
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:12,841
because that's a thing now.

256
00:16:12,884 --> 00:16:14,364
The woman's a monster.

257
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:16,366
Yeah. She wants an increase in kill shelters.

258
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,455
I mean, who campaigns on killing puppies?

259
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:21,023
She's retained us at the rate of 50,000 a month.

260
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:23,025
-She has my full support. -Our country needs her.

261
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:25,027
Yeah, well, she was up in the polls as of last night,

262
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:27,247
but all that's gonna change because this morning

263
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:31,164
the Los Angeles Tatlerran this series of paparazzi photos

264
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:34,471
showing Ms. Nordheim enjoying the company

265
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:39,433
of 20-year-old personal trainer slash actor, Dake Wharton.

266
00:16:39,476 --> 00:16:42,740
-Oh, my God. -Is that a squash?

267
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:45,091
Look, this one's easy. It's a classic redirect.

268
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:47,354
She repents, goes to church every Sunday,

269
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:51,053
does a couple of guest sermons, talks about rebirth through God.

270
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:52,446
Somethin' there. Tony.

271
00:16:52,489 --> 00:16:53,795
I mean, I say, we blame the dude.

272
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:55,666
Nordheim was manipulated

273
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:59,757
by some Hollywood pretty boy who preys on middle-aged women

274
00:16:59,801 --> 00:17:01,629
in order to extort money for sex.

275
00:17:01,672 --> 00:17:03,413
Okay, she is the victim here.

276
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:10,290
-Claire? -Uh ... um ...

277
00:17:12,988 --> 00:17:14,685
When I was in eight grade

278
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:18,472
Ben Barnes, he drew private parts on my notebook,

279
00:17:18,515 --> 00:17:20,430
but I-I put stickers over top of them

280
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:21,866
and I turned them into unicorn.

281
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,260
I actually still have it, it's kinda cool.

282
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:31,354
Moving on.

283
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:50,678
-Do you yield? -No.

284
00:17:50,721 --> 00:17:51,766
W-wh-what's your book?

285
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:53,985
I'm not, I'm not part of this.

286
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:55,813
You're not here to use the bathtub?

287
00:17:55,857 --> 00:17:57,119
No, well, I mean, I use the bathtub.

288
00:17:57,163 --> 00:17:58,990
-It's my apartment. -You live here?

289
00:17:59,034 --> 00:18:00,818
That's, that's disgusting.

290
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:02,646
This is our house. Me and Claire.

291
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,778
Get out, get out.

292
00:18:17,357 --> 00:18:19,141
Oh, hello, Barry.

293
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:21,230
Danielle, you're looking well.

294
00:18:21,274 --> 00:18:24,233
Please spare me the pleasantries.

295
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:26,017
Do you yield?

296
00:18:26,061 --> 00:18:30,152
I do not!

297
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:32,459
-What's your book? -The honorable Robert Perkins.

298
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:35,244
The book of the honorable Robert Perkins.

299
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:38,552
I choose verse 60!

300
00:18:38,595 --> 00:18:40,119
"Despite having shown

301
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:41,859
no remorse for these brutal

302
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:45,385
and cold-blooded murders, it is my regret that the state

303
00:18:45,428 --> 00:18:48,953
must refile these charges due to improper warrant

304
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:52,348
for the search and seizure of evidence relating to the murder

305
00:18:52,392 --> 00:18:54,263
of Ms. Elizabeth Watson!"

306
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:56,831
-Watkins! - No!

307
00:18:56,874 --> 00:18:58,311
Watkins!

308
00:18:58,354 --> 00:19:00,356
It's kins! Dammit!

309
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,534
Who knows the book? I know the book, Barry!

310
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:06,536
I can tell you this.

311
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,059
This is not over.

312
00:19:09,844 --> 00:19:11,150
Now that is how it's done.

313
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:12,499
What w-was that?

314
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:13,804
The challenge,

315
00:19:13,848 --> 00:19:17,373
and next talent.

316
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:20,550
What I Did Over Spring Break by Danielle Carter.

317
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:24,641
"This summer, my mom and step-dad took us all to Denmark.

318
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:28,036
We went to Legoland and it was really cool.

319
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,039
There was a giant dragon made from Legos

320
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:34,216
and they serve vanilla pudding in the cafeteria.

321
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,524
My favorite thing about Legoland was the hotel.

322
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:40,179
The bed was made from giant Legos

323
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:43,269
and, uh, they serve pancakes for breakfast.

324
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:46,010
In conclusion, Legoland is a very good place

325
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:47,925
to go for your spring vacation.

326
00:19:47,969 --> 00:19:50,145
I recommend it highly

327
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,539
for friends and family alike."

328
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:55,106
That's great, that's, seriously, that's a,

329
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,283
that's a really nice piece of writing.

330
00:19:57,326 --> 00:19:59,154
Oh, I did... I got an A on it.

331
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,852
-Did you? Oh. -Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

332
00:20:01,896 --> 00:20:06,553
Oh, well. Time for me to achieve eternal bliss.

333
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:11,993
Oh, shit!

334
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:13,386
I forgot my knife. Do you have a knife?

335
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:15,301
-A knife to kill yourself with? -Yeah, yeah.

336
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:17,041
Well, I'm not gonna, I don't want your blood and guts

337
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:18,391
all over one of my knives. That's gross.

338
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:20,044
That's what dishwashers are for.

339
00:20:20,088 --> 00:20:21,307
Then I'm gonna think about what

340
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,656
you did with it every time I use it.

341
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:23,787
Well, just put it in

342
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:25,049
amongst all the other knives

343
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:26,616
and then you wouldn't even remember.

344
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,183
Then I-I'm gonna think about that with all my knives.

345
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,837
Well, th-throw it away then.

346
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,665
So now I'm giving you a knife?

347
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,711
No. Is there anything else I can provide you with?

348
00:20:34,755 --> 00:20:38,541
Maybe like a spoon to scoop your eyeballs out

349
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:41,544
or maybe a cheese grater to shave off your nipples?

350
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:44,243
Jesus! I don't appreciate this kind of talk.

351
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:46,245
Well, I don't appreciate a complete stranger

352
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:50,118
doing a suicide in my bathtub. Ah!

353
00:20:50,161 --> 00:20:52,033
We haven't unpacked the knives yet.

354
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:55,079
But you do have a screwdriver!

355
00:20:55,123 --> 00:20:58,126
No! No!

356
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:03,523
Stop it! Claire! Help! Help me!

357
00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:06,656
-Oh, God! -Oh!

358
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,397
-Oh, God. -Oh!

359
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:10,747
What the fudge? You stabbed me!

360
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:14,403
Oh, my God!

361
00:21:14,447 --> 00:21:16,840
-Oh, right in the spine. -Oh, my God!

362
00:21:16,884 --> 00:21:18,233
Why did you shove her like that?

363
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,670
-She was attacking you! -No, she was...

364
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:22,455
She was trying to kill herself! She's a cult member.

365
00:21:24,587 --> 00:21:26,067
Stop screaming!

366
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,068
Ah! So loud!

367
00:21:27,111 --> 00:21:28,504
Stop screaming!

368
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:39,472
-Oh, God. -Ah!

369
00:21:40,777 --> 00:21:43,345
He's never gonna believe us.

370
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:47,088
-Who? -Th-that Detective Cartwright.

371
00:21:47,131 --> 00:21:48,350
-He's never gonna believe us. -Why?

372
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:50,047
-Why wouldn't he believe us? -Uh...

373
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:52,398
Uh, look around. I mean...

374
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:55,226
The screwdriver in her back and there's blood on the wall and--

375
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,707
-Oh, my God! You're right! -Oh, God!

376
00:21:57,751 --> 00:22:00,188
You're right! What, what are we gonna do?

377
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:01,494
-Tell us what to do, Claire! -I don't know.

378
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:02,712
-Tell us what to do! -I don't know!

379
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:03,800
Just let me think, let me think,

380
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:05,324
let me think, please.

381
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:12,679
Change the story.

382
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:21,252
This is how we found her.

383
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:24,212
Yeah, she totally committed self-murder in the bathtub.

384
00:22:24,255 --> 00:22:28,999
She stabbed herself in the back?

385
00:22:29,043 --> 00:22:31,567
I know. Right?

386
00:22:31,611 --> 00:22:34,222
This is the sloppiest tub death I've ever seen.

387
00:22:34,265 --> 00:22:35,963
Yeah, 'cause how many times do you get to practice

388
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:38,226
your own suicide?

389
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:40,184
Yes, that's actually a good point.

390
00:22:40,228 --> 00:22:41,795
-'Cause he gets, he gets... -Just in one shot.

391
00:22:41,838 --> 00:22:42,883
Yeah.

392
00:22:46,277 --> 00:22:49,106
Here comes Wallace on the comedy bus five minutes late.

393
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,325
That's how humor works.

394
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,718
It's an involuntary reaction

395
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:52,719
when you find something funny.

396
00:22:52,762 --> 00:22:54,198
You can't fake it after you hear

397
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:56,375
two people laughing, you child.

398
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:07,690
You've been unpacking.

399
00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:10,345
You kids planning on staying?

400
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,347
Yeah, uh, you know, it's a great location,

401
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,523
it's close to freeways.

402
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:17,178
Really?

403
00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:19,833
Y-you know, that really shows some backbone.

404
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:23,706
To be honest, a lot of the people just leave right away.

405
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,665
That's good. Y-you're gonna like it.

406
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:27,362
There is a, um...

407
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,670
There is a nice pizza place about three blocks up

408
00:23:30,713 --> 00:23:32,193
called Schneider's

409
00:23:32,236 --> 00:23:34,935
and they have a two-for-one deal

410
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:37,851
where you get a can of Pepsi for free on weekdays.

411
00:23:37,894 --> 00:23:39,896
I don't know if you guys, uh,

412
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,856
like pizza. Everybody does.

413
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:45,467
- O-oh. -Oh, you...

414
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:48,818
Yeah, I... Well, we... I have to, I have to work.

415
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:51,038
I don't know why you're telling me that.

416
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:52,692
I have work, too. Everyone has work.

417
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:55,172
That's... Uh, why are you telling me you have work?

418
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:56,739
-Is it non sequitur? -Oh, no, I didn't mean--

419
00:23:56,783 --> 00:23:59,350
'Cause I wasn't asking you guys to hang out with me.

420
00:23:59,394 --> 00:24:01,004
-I'm a police officer. -Oh, of course.

421
00:24:01,048 --> 00:24:03,442
I'm a detective. I, I work.

422
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:04,921
Oh, no, I didn't mean--

423
00:24:04,965 --> 00:24:06,967
The job's frankly all I got.

424
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:10,579
It's, uh... Which is probably why I caught Storsh.

425
00:24:10,623 --> 00:24:12,407
He did not get away from me.

426
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,497
He got away from a department with its head up its ass.

427
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:18,848
I was not the one asleep at the switch.

428
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:21,372
You know, this Storsh character,

429
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:24,680
i-it's like, a lot of the stuff in this book makes sense.

430
00:24:24,724 --> 00:24:26,508
You know, I mean, some of it's crazy, obviously,

431
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:29,685
but some of it isn't. Like, okay, for example...

432
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:32,514
One of the things is being the best you you can be.

433
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:33,733
Well, I don't see anything wrong with being

434
00:24:33,776 --> 00:24:34,908
the best you I can be.

435
00:24:34,951 --> 00:24:37,127
No, the best you youcan be.

436
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,130
That's what I said.

437
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:41,784
OK. Around...

438
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:43,525
For example, here's another really good one.

439
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:45,266
Uh... Oh, here. Listen to this.

440
00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:48,182
"When one liberates oneself from the shackles of overthought,

441
00:24:48,225 --> 00:24:49,966
life can truly be free.

442
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,534
Open yourself to your inner will and close the door

443
00:24:52,578 --> 00:24:54,623
on the addiction to outside approval."

444
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:58,584
I mean, this is me at work. I totally relate to this.

445
00:24:58,627 --> 00:25:00,673
Like, I'm always worried about what other people are thinking.

446
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:01,978
I don't even know what I'm thinking.

447
00:25:02,022 --> 00:25:04,111
This stuff really makes sense.

448
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,768
You know, I'm not smart like you are, Claire.

449
00:25:08,811 --> 00:25:10,552
Oh, Paul.

450
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:14,164
But I don't have to be smart because I've got you.

451
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:16,950
And-and now that we're casting off the shackles of overthought,

452
00:25:16,993 --> 00:25:19,300
I swear my most deepest swear

453
00:25:19,343 --> 00:25:21,215
that I'm gonna get a job,

454
00:25:21,258 --> 00:25:23,696
like, as soon as possible.

455
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:26,568
New city, new Paul, new us.

456
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:28,657
-Oh, Paul.

457
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:30,703
-I believe in you. -Oh.

458
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:32,531
-I believe in you. -Yeah?

459
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:36,360
Oh, I love you, my Claire.

460
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:48,242
Claire, Claire, hi. So we just got the call.

461
00:25:48,285 --> 00:25:50,331
Nordheim is coming in to see what we have for the campaign.

462
00:25:50,374 --> 00:25:51,680
-Now? -Yeah, now.

463
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,815
Ah.

464
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:06,521
We weren't expecting Mr. Nordheim.

465
00:26:09,437 --> 00:26:11,134
-Oh...

466
00:26:15,443 --> 00:26:18,707
Well, we were thinking,

467
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:22,798
what if you were to repent.

468
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:24,017
The religious angle.

469
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,672
-You find Jesus. -I'm Jewish.

470
00:26:26,715 --> 00:26:30,066
Obviously you did a workup on me and you already know that.

471
00:26:32,112 --> 00:26:34,810
Okay.

472
00:26:34,854 --> 00:26:36,464
We put a story in the paper

473
00:26:36,507 --> 00:26:39,554
that the young man with whom you had relations

474
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,383
is actually a con artist

475
00:26:42,426 --> 00:26:44,559
preying on...

476
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:50,434
Preying on?

477
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,002
Praying...

478
00:26:55,091 --> 00:26:57,398
Tony, why don't you take this one since it's your idea?

479
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:02,446
Sure. Uh...

480
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:07,190
Um, uh... I see sort of like a, uh,

481
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:09,453
a basketball player, but instead of legs,

482
00:27:09,497 --> 00:27:13,544
um, it's got tang threads. So, like a ro...

483
00:27:13,588 --> 00:27:15,459
Ro...

484
00:27:17,766 --> 00:27:20,595
Okay, I'm gonna speak now.

485
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:24,425
I am not impressed with any of this.

486
00:27:24,468 --> 00:27:26,340
And if this is all you have, I'm going to be

487
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:30,213
very, very, very disappointed.

488
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,785
I have an idea.

489
00:27:51,452 --> 00:27:54,281
What exactly would you say your strengths are?

490
00:27:54,324 --> 00:27:57,806
Well, uh, first and foremost, I am a people-pleaser.

491
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,939
-Pe-people like me. -Well, I don't like you.

492
00:27:59,982 --> 00:28:03,116
And I have a hard time seeing how anyone would.

493
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:04,726
Please, just, sir, just give me a chance.

494
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,511
Do you even know what it is we do here?

495
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:10,514
Y-y-you guys design roller coasters, right?

496
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:12,299
Well, you managed to get that right.

497
00:28:12,342 --> 00:28:15,606
How many years of mechanical engineering do you have?

498
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,565
No, no, no, no. I'm sorry. Listen.

499
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:19,306
Listen, I really need this job.

500
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:20,960
My girlfriend said that I-I have to get my job thing

501
00:28:21,003 --> 00:28:22,135
sorted or we can never get married.

502
00:28:22,178 --> 00:28:24,354
-Uh! Your girlfriend? -Yeah.

503
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:27,227
You're in here wasting my time because of your girlfriend?

504
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,358
-No, no, please-- -I'm shocked...

505
00:28:28,402 --> 00:28:30,578
You even have a girlfriend.

506
00:28:30,621 --> 00:28:31,927
I wouldn't be surprised if she leaves you

507
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:33,712
by the end of the week because

508
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:36,584
there is no job for you here

509
00:28:36,627 --> 00:28:38,717
or anywhere in this city.

510
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:42,285
-No... -Now get out of my office!

511
00:29:00,434 --> 00:29:03,524
Hi, Paul. Why so glumy, chummy?

512
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,358
I can't get a job.

513
00:29:12,838 --> 00:29:15,797
No one will hire me.

514
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:18,234
Uh, not after what happened in Ohio.

515
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:20,541
What's the what in Ohio, huh?

516
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,242
Okay.

517
00:29:26,286 --> 00:29:28,549
Did you know that in 33% of marriages

518
00:29:28,592 --> 00:29:30,029
somebody commits infidelity?

519
00:29:30,072 --> 00:29:32,901
And that's only the ones who admitted, so...

520
00:29:32,945 --> 00:29:36,078
So you were caught having a little fun on the side.

521
00:29:36,122 --> 00:29:39,081
I'm sure every woman in America would understand

522
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,692
if you just put it into context. Yeah.

523
00:29:41,736 --> 00:29:44,565
What context is that?

524
00:29:44,608 --> 00:29:46,132
Let's break the shackles of approval

525
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:50,484
and show everyone it's okay to be the real you.

526
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:52,616
I made this thing. It's a...

527
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,531
Really, a-all you need to do is

528
00:29:54,575 --> 00:29:58,144
show these, these two pictures side-by-side

529
00:29:58,187 --> 00:30:00,537
and then simply ask...

549
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,340
This one time last year...

550
00:31:04,384 --> 00:31:07,909
I stayed up really late to watch The Storage Warsmarathon.

551
00:31:07,953 --> 00:31:10,520
It's a really awesome show because I like stuff

552
00:31:10,564 --> 00:31:12,914
about storage units.

553
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,785
Anyway, I was gonna go to bed, but then I remembered

554
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:16,352
that Claire had asked me to do the laundry,

555
00:31:16,396 --> 00:31:17,876
so I stayed up for the rest of the night

556
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,921
and did the laundry.

557
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:22,097
Um, but then, then,

558
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:23,490
the-the dryer didn't finish in time,

559
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:25,013
and I had to go to my job

560
00:31:25,057 --> 00:31:28,016
at the water filtration plant.

561
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:31,759
And so I just wore my uniform damp.

562
00:31:31,802 --> 00:31:36,111
But then on my walk to work, um, I got really, really cold.

563
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:41,334
And I couldn't stop shivering, so I stopped at the gas station

564
00:31:41,377 --> 00:31:43,945
and got a Mountain Dew.

565
00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:47,035
And when I got to work, I tried to heat the Mountain,

566
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:50,386
Mountain Dew up on a hot plate.

567
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,649
But then the plastic melted

568
00:31:52,693 --> 00:31:56,566
and-and, and then the melted plastic and the Mountain Dew

569
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,959
got all over my hands

570
00:31:58,003 --> 00:32:01,963
and I knocked over a can of turpentine

571
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:03,573
and that mixed with some oldie peanuts

572
00:32:03,617 --> 00:32:06,185
and then that dripped into the filtration fluids.

573
00:32:06,228 --> 00:32:10,667
And then the, the melty Mountain-Dewie plastic

574
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:13,714
and the, and the mold and the turpentine

575
00:32:13,757 --> 00:32:16,717
all mixed together and made some w-weird chemical reaction

576
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:21,330
and-and then that... that got into the town's water supply.

577
00:32:23,071 --> 00:32:26,901
And the entire town lost their hair.

578
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:30,731
All their hair.

579
00:32:30,774 --> 00:32:33,864
Their arms and their legs and their eyebrows.

580
00:32:33,908 --> 00:32:38,608
And then... and then about half the town,

581
00:32:38,652 --> 00:32:40,915
let's say, about 80,000 people,

582
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,874
got rage madness and they started foaming at the mouth

583
00:32:43,918 --> 00:32:46,051
and attacking each other for no reason.

584
00:32:46,094 --> 00:32:49,271
And then the whole town became a war zone.

585
00:32:49,315 --> 00:32:52,318
And we had to stay inside, but everybody got so hungry.

586
00:32:52,361 --> 00:32:54,450
But then the rage people stole all the food

587
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:57,018
and they, they hid it in a used tire yard.

588
00:32:57,062 --> 00:33:01,457
And they built this massive fort out of used tires.

589
00:33:01,501 --> 00:33:04,330
It was like a beehive, and then they stayed in,

590
00:33:04,373 --> 00:33:06,201
in the tire hive and they wouldn't come out.

591
00:33:06,245 --> 00:33:07,811
And so then all the

592
00:33:07,855 --> 00:33:09,639
then the normal people burned down the tire hive.

593
00:33:09,683 --> 00:33:12,555
But then the fire, the fire burned for months

594
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:15,689
because it was just millions of used tires.

595
00:33:15,732 --> 00:33:17,734
And then we all had to go to the woods

596
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:19,345
and hunt for animals.

597
00:33:19,388 --> 00:33:21,347
But it was the summer and, and it was so hot

598
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:24,132
and we all took off all of our, our clothes

599
00:33:24,176 --> 00:33:26,265
and then we ran out of bullets.

600
00:33:26,308 --> 00:33:29,616
And so there's just a bunch of hairless naked people

601
00:33:29,659 --> 00:33:32,880
running around the woods, hunting for deer

602
00:33:32,923 --> 00:33:36,231
and raccoons and squirrels with our bare hands.

603
00:33:36,275 --> 00:33:39,234
And then, t-then everyone

604
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:42,672
got really hungry again 'cause we ran out of animals.

605
00:33:42,716 --> 00:33:47,068
And then... then you couldn't tell the normal people

606
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:48,852
from the rage people

607
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:51,681
and-and you couldn't tell who was who.

608
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:53,292
And then a militia came from another state

609
00:33:53,335 --> 00:33:55,337
and they called us all s-skinners

610
00:33:55,381 --> 00:33:58,166
and th-they hunted us for sport.

611
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:01,387
And then the National Guard came to fight the militia

612
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:04,085
and then the government sent in the army

613
00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:06,479
to rescue us all

614
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:09,525
and then when it was all done...

615
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:12,354
they told me I couldn't go back to Ohio anymore.

616
00:34:18,404 --> 00:34:20,232
Oh, Paul.

617
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:22,756
Sounds like you've been on quite the journey.

618
00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:24,410
But your true journey of bliss

619
00:34:24,453 --> 00:34:26,499
found on the instantaneous eternity

620
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:29,415
only begins when you change your story.

621
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:32,374
It's time to loose the Os in Ohio

622
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:34,942
and say hito the new Paul,

623
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:38,989
a Paul who's his own boss, a Paul who answers to Paul.

624
00:34:39,033 --> 00:34:40,513
To-me?

625
00:34:40,556 --> 00:34:42,123
It's like the Book Of Storiessays.

626
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:45,518
The only thing you've to worry about is what you think.

627
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:48,303
If there's no job for you, make your own job.

628
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:52,264
Be like me. Be free. Free like a bird, bird.

629
00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:56,398
Free? Like a bird, bird?

630
00:34:57,747 --> 00:34:59,749
Like a bird, bird.

631
00:35:00,663 --> 00:35:01,838
Yeah.

632
00:35:08,976 --> 00:35:10,282
- Hey-hey!

633
00:35:10,325 --> 00:35:13,067
-Hey! -I had the best day.

634
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,851
Me, too. I had, I have huge news.

635
00:35:14,895 --> 00:35:16,114
Oh, okay. You first.

636
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:17,767
So I-I slammed the door

637
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:19,160
on the jackals of over-thoughts.

638
00:35:19,204 --> 00:35:20,683
Just like you said, I've been so worried

639
00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:22,076
about what everyone else thinks I should be

640
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,078
that I forgot what I want to be.

641
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,906
Oh, well, that-that's amazing. What do you wanna be, Paul?

642
00:35:25,949 --> 00:35:28,169
A bird housemaker.

643
00:35:28,213 --> 00:35:30,606
I make birdhouses now.

644
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,695
How, how, how.

645
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:35,307
Oh, wow! You, you made all of these?

646
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,917
Yeah, I'm in the zone.

647
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,919
Look, so this one's a little pool house, right?

648
00:35:38,962 --> 00:35:40,747
And it's got a little lounge chair, a little changing room

649
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,531
where the birds can change out of their red clothes.

650
00:35:42,575 --> 00:35:44,185
A simple mother-daughter apartment

651
00:35:44,229 --> 00:35:46,013
for when mom gets really old and she could die,

652
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:47,493
she could die at any moment.

653
00:35:47,536 --> 00:35:48,711
There's a little mechanical chair

654
00:35:48,755 --> 00:35:50,191
that goes up and down the stairs.

655
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:51,714
This one is modelled after Chuck E. Cheese,

656
00:35:51,758 --> 00:35:53,368
but I call it Chick E. Cheese.

657
00:35:53,412 --> 00:35:55,196
And there's a little bosspit.

658
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,155
And there's a fake band and then this one is a honeymoon suite,

659
00:35:57,198 --> 00:36:01,202
it's got a, um, a heart-shaped bed for getting it on.

660
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:05,598
Oh, look. Claire, I almost forgot.

661
00:36:05,641 --> 00:36:08,253
This one's for you.

662
00:36:08,296 --> 00:36:10,994
It's an exact replica scale

663
00:36:11,038 --> 00:36:13,171
of the Full Houseliving room, season one.

664
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:16,565
Paul, this is, this is amazing!

665
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:18,045
You don't have to say that.

666
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:21,570
No, Paul. No. I-I'm really proud of you.

667
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,747
-Mm. -Thank you.

668
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:28,229
-Tell me about your day! -Oh--

669
00:36:28,273 --> 00:36:30,144
I can't believe. I've been so focused on, I...

670
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,624
What about your day? Take the mic.

671
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:33,756
-Okay.

672
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,758
- Is it on? Okay. - You...

673
00:36:35,802 --> 00:36:37,456
Um, so, yeah, we had this, the surprise visit

674
00:36:37,499 --> 00:36:39,849
from a client at work and everyone was, like, stressed out

675
00:36:39,893 --> 00:36:42,504
and losing their minds, but I kept my cool and I saved the day

676
00:36:42,548 --> 00:36:44,506
with a stunning pitch when everyone else had nothing.

677
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,247
-And Pearl even shook my hand. -That hand?

678
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:47,248
-Yeah! -All right!

679
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:48,771
I knew you could do it!

680
00:36:48,815 --> 00:36:50,556
You know, and I-I just applied the teachings

681
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:52,166
of Storsh and it actually worked.

682
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,473
-Oh, my God. I love Storsh. -Yeah, I know. Me, too.

683
00:36:54,516 --> 00:36:56,779
I'm so jacked up right now, I can sell anything.

684
00:36:56,823 --> 00:36:59,217
-Well, sell me a birdhouse. -How about a pun?

685
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,958
Like, uh, Paul's birdhouse, when nature Pauls.

686
00:37:02,002 --> 00:37:03,308
-That's brilliant!

687
00:37:03,351 --> 00:37:04,918
Okay, here's another... Uh, uh...

688
00:37:04,961 --> 00:37:07,703
This birdhouse will never Paul out of a tree.

689
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:09,444
You gotta slow down. I gotta write this down. Seriously. I--

690
00:37:09,488 --> 00:37:11,403
Oh, no, no. Don't even sweat it. I got a million of 'em.

691
00:37:11,446 --> 00:37:13,492
Okay, how about this one? Uh, uh, Paul's Boyd...

692
00:37:13,535 --> 00:37:15,581
Paul Boyd's birdie birdhouse building.

693
00:37:15,624 --> 00:37:17,757
-Ah! You know what your name is? -What?

694
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,193
-Little Ms. Ideas. Yes. -No.

695
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,281
-You're amazing. -No, you're amazing.

696
00:37:20,325 --> 00:37:21,500
-We're amazing. -Yeah.

697
00:37:21,543 --> 00:37:22,936
You know what this means, Claire?

698
00:37:22,979 --> 00:37:24,764
We're finally getting our stuff sorted.

699
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:25,982
Yeah.

700
00:37:42,216 --> 00:37:44,305
It was the '90s,

701
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:47,526
a different time, a simpler time.

702
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:50,964
When a man committed a crime, you kicked in the door

703
00:37:51,007 --> 00:37:53,532
and worried about paperwork later.

704
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:57,405
But like all good times,

705
00:37:57,449 --> 00:37:59,625
that time was a time

706
00:37:59,668 --> 00:38:02,497
whose time has come to an end.

707
00:38:04,847 --> 00:38:08,068
Then on April 2nd, 1997,

708
00:38:08,111 --> 00:38:11,767
I came face-to-face with pure evil.

709
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:13,378
Reginald Euclid Storsh,

710
00:38:13,421 --> 00:38:15,728
incited over two dozen innocent victims

711
00:38:15,771 --> 00:38:17,425
to self-murder.

712
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:20,341
An adversary so brilliant, so cunning

713
00:38:20,385 --> 00:38:22,038
that to merely be in his presence

714
00:38:22,082 --> 00:38:23,692
was to risk total mental

715
00:38:23,736 --> 00:38:26,347
and spiritual annihilation.

716
00:38:26,391 --> 00:38:29,263
"Detective Cartwright, did you have a warrant

717
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,004
for these proceedings?"

718
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:34,442
"A warrant? Hell, no, Your Honor, he's guilty."

719
00:38:34,486 --> 00:38:37,402
"Well, I don't care how ridiculous or stupid

720
00:38:37,445 --> 00:38:40,318
or unfair it is, I declare a mistrial.

721
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:42,145
Case dismissed."

722
00:38:42,189 --> 00:38:44,539
"Your Honor, no!"

723
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:46,889
So I made my life's goal up

724
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:49,544
to not give him a moment's rest.

725
00:38:49,588 --> 00:38:51,720
I dogged him like a dog.

726
00:38:51,764 --> 00:38:54,854
But six months into it, he committed suicide

727
00:38:54,897 --> 00:38:56,508
in a bath tub.

728
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:58,945
Then his followers started committing suicide

729
00:38:58,988 --> 00:39:00,076
in the same tub.

730
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,122
Cultist after cultist

731
00:39:02,165 --> 00:39:04,385
dove into a porcelain nightmare

732
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:06,779
of blood and death.

733
00:39:06,822 --> 00:39:09,347
The chief still has the case open.

734
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,000
And guess who has to clean up

735
00:39:11,044 --> 00:39:13,133
every time one of these morons

736
00:39:13,176 --> 00:39:15,744
commits a see-pa-coo in the tub?

737
00:39:15,788 --> 00:39:18,704
That's right. Me. Cartwright.

738
00:39:18,747 --> 00:39:20,749
The last good cop.

739
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:38,854
Go, go, go, go, go, go. Go, go, go.

740
00:39:57,612 --> 00:39:59,832
-Hey. -Mm!

741
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:02,835
Oh... Oh, come on, man!

742
00:40:02,878 --> 00:40:05,315
-What? -I booked the tub!

743
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,579
It's been on the schedule for months.

744
00:40:07,622 --> 00:40:10,277
Okay. Just do it.

745
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,672
Three-way challenge. Do you yield?

746
00:40:13,715 --> 00:40:15,674
I-I, I don't, I don't know. Do we?

747
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:20,635
The invocation.

748
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:22,463
"In order to get to instantaneous eternity,

749
00:40:22,507 --> 00:40:23,899
you must pass through the gateway

750
00:40:23,943 --> 00:40:25,771
chosen by the Holy Storsh."

751
00:40:29,949 --> 00:40:34,040
What? Oh, my God! You're initiates, aren't you?

752
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,955
Uh, initiates. Yeah.

753
00:40:35,998 --> 00:40:38,392
Actually, do you, do you think you could teach us

754
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,612
some initiate stuff?

755
00:40:43,832 --> 00:40:47,009
Well, maybe I'll break the rules this one time.

756
00:40:48,707 --> 00:40:50,404
- Awesome. -Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

757
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:54,321
All right, um, you know, you two guys really lucked out.

758
00:40:54,364 --> 00:40:57,672
It's not every day that two initiates

759
00:40:57,716 --> 00:41:00,240
get taught their invocation

760
00:41:00,283 --> 00:41:02,416
by a level-six instructor.

761
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,678
-Level six? -Yeah.

762
00:41:03,722 --> 00:41:05,071
Is that, uh, is that a good level?

763
00:41:05,114 --> 00:41:06,812
Uh, there's only 11 levels

764
00:41:06,855 --> 00:41:09,858
and I'm level six, which is basically level seven,

765
00:41:09,902 --> 00:41:11,425
so really I'm an eight.

766
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,559
So, yeah, I'd say it's pretty damn good.

767
00:41:14,602 --> 00:41:17,605
And I specialize in invocation training.

768
00:41:17,649 --> 00:41:20,086
You could say I'm kind of a big deal

769
00:41:20,129 --> 00:41:21,827
down at East Side Bethel, you know?

770
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:23,306
-Huh. Mm! - Okay.

771
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,265
-Uh, so lie down. -All right.

772
00:41:25,308 --> 00:41:26,919
Here.

773
00:41:26,962 --> 00:41:29,704
Okay. Like the...

774
00:41:29,748 --> 00:41:34,448
Uh, okay, um, scooch down towards me a little.

775
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,755
Okay, now go left, uh, just a little bit.

776
00:41:36,798 --> 00:41:38,757
Okay. Actually, scooch back up just a couple of...

777
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,020
Yeah, okay, that's good. And come over to your right.

778
00:41:41,063 --> 00:41:42,412
Okay, you're moving faster, so, so just...

779
00:41:42,456 --> 00:41:43,413
-Yeah. And then... -Me? Oh. Okay.

780
00:41:43,457 --> 00:41:45,111
You come down just a touch.

781
00:41:45,154 --> 00:41:46,155
Perfect.

782
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:51,073
Actually, you know what? Go, go back a little bit.

783
00:41:51,117 --> 00:41:55,208
That's it. That's it! Nice.

784
00:41:55,251 --> 00:41:57,471
This guy is awesome. I mean, he's basically a level eight.

785
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,473
- I know.

786
00:42:02,911 --> 00:42:04,783
Okay.

787
00:42:04,826 --> 00:42:08,003
Now look up to the light.

788
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:12,181
That's life.

789
00:42:12,225 --> 00:42:15,881
It's bright, it's inviting, it's warm.

790
00:42:15,924 --> 00:42:18,361
That's light. That's life.

791
00:42:18,405 --> 00:42:21,103
And this is death.

792
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,587
What do you see?

793
00:42:28,067 --> 00:42:31,070
I-I can still see an outline.

794
00:42:31,113 --> 00:42:32,854
But it's fading.

795
00:42:32,898 --> 00:42:34,247
Exactly.

796
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:37,380
See, normally when someone dies,

797
00:42:37,424 --> 00:42:40,775
there's a little bit of afterglow that lingers.

798
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:43,430
But then unfortunately, it just disperses

799
00:42:43,473 --> 00:42:45,171
into the ether.

800
00:42:45,214 --> 00:42:49,088
But thanks to the great Storsh,

801
00:42:49,131 --> 00:42:52,787
his chosen will bask in the light of eternity.

802
00:42:52,831 --> 00:42:55,573
Just because the magical Storsh

803
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:58,750
spilled his magical blood in that bath tub,

804
00:42:58,793 --> 00:43:00,708
the bath tub is magical

805
00:43:00,752 --> 00:43:03,624
and will magically hold on to the afterglow

806
00:43:03,668 --> 00:43:06,279
for all eternity.

807
00:43:06,322 --> 00:43:08,542
All of that in a bath tub?

808
00:43:19,988 --> 00:43:22,556
Would you like to bear witness to my exodus?

809
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:35,090
Cyanide. It's quick. Painless.

810
00:43:50,715 --> 00:43:52,717
Well...

811
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,154
I'm sorry, I didn't think I would get emotional.

812
00:43:56,808 --> 00:44:00,289
You know, you two are gonna be great followers.

813
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:02,030
Hm.

814
00:44:02,074 --> 00:44:03,641
I'm gonna tell Storsh about you

815
00:44:03,684 --> 00:44:06,121
when I get to the other side.

816
00:44:06,165 --> 00:44:08,080
-That's neat.

817
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:11,997
Yeah.

818
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,302
Bye.

819
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:23,051
It's just a sec.

820
00:44:33,409 --> 00:44:34,541
Any second.

821
00:44:47,032 --> 00:44:49,077
-Oh! Oh! Ow! Whoa! -Oh...

822
00:44:49,121 --> 00:44:51,558
Whoa, wait, hey, this actually hurts quite a bit.

823
00:44:51,601 --> 00:44:53,778
-Oh, Go... Oh, no! -Ah! Oh, God!

824
00:44:53,821 --> 00:44:55,997
Oh! Oh, actually, this hurts quite a lot actually!

825
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:58,696
-Do you want some water? -Oh, for the love of Christ!

826
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:01,046
They're inside of my body,

827
00:45:01,089 --> 00:45:02,656
burning like a thousand suns!

828
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,702
-No! Oh, no! -I'll go get a first-aid kit!

829
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:06,747
-No! You idiot!

830
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:09,663
I wanna die! Kill me!

831
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:10,838
-Kill me! -Just go!

832
00:45:10,882 --> 00:45:11,926
Oh, my God!

833
00:45:17,105 --> 00:45:18,759
Use this! Use this!

834
00:45:18,803 --> 00:45:20,239
-Me? -Yes!

835
00:45:20,282 --> 00:45:21,849
Oh! Oh!

836
00:45:25,157 --> 00:45:27,289
-I am sorry!

837
00:45:28,551 --> 00:45:31,032
What kind of cheap knife is that?

838
00:45:31,076 --> 00:45:32,773
-We're on a budget, okay? -No!

839
00:45:32,817 --> 00:45:35,341
-Stab harder! Do it!

840
00:45:41,913 --> 00:45:44,002
-Come on! -No!

841
00:45:44,045 --> 00:45:46,047
Oh! Claire, stop it!

842
00:45:46,091 --> 00:45:49,703
-Stop! Claire, no!

843
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,444
We need better killing!

844
00:45:55,578 --> 00:45:58,364
Oh, God! You can't kill me with that stapler!

845
00:45:58,407 --> 00:46:01,149
-Oh, God! Aah! -Oh!

846
00:46:01,193 --> 00:46:03,848
You have no idea how much this hurts!

847
00:46:03,891 --> 00:46:05,414
Plug it in!

848
00:46:08,461 --> 00:46:10,376
Why won't you die?

849
00:46:13,858 --> 00:46:15,816
I gotta get 'em out!

850
00:46:19,733 --> 00:46:20,690
Oh!

851
00:46:30,352 --> 00:46:32,964
Is there something you wanna tell me, Claire?

852
00:46:33,007 --> 00:46:35,880
Uh, no, I-I don't think so.

853
00:46:35,923 --> 00:46:38,317
You're sure about that?

854
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,275
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

855
00:46:43,757 --> 00:46:45,890
I get why you would, but it's not a good idea

856
00:46:45,933 --> 00:46:47,892
to lie to a detective, it's...

857
00:46:47,935 --> 00:46:49,763
I detect.

858
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:53,419
I get to the bottom of things. It's my job.

859
00:46:53,462 --> 00:46:55,682
And your job is,

860
00:46:55,725 --> 00:46:58,380
you work in the business.

861
00:46:58,424 --> 00:47:00,295
-The business? -Yeah.

862
00:47:00,339 --> 00:47:02,558
The ad business? I found out.

863
00:47:02,602 --> 00:47:05,039
You work at Global Creative.

864
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:08,738
Okay, come on. I-I... Let me wet my beak.

865
00:47:08,782 --> 00:47:12,133
Do you understand how you could help a person in my situation?

866
00:47:12,177 --> 00:47:14,266
Just...

867
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:16,703
Oh, hey! Is this your screenplay? Cool!

868
00:47:16,746 --> 00:47:18,966
I didn't exactly pick a title yet, but...

869
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:22,143
Well, what exactly do you want me to do with this?

870
00:47:22,187 --> 00:47:23,884
Well, do what you do. Talk to people.

871
00:47:23,928 --> 00:47:26,844
You must know actors, right? D-do you know Wesley Snipes?

872
00:47:26,887 --> 00:47:28,976
He's who I always picture when I'm writing about myself.

873
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:31,196
Uh, he needs this.

874
00:47:31,239 --> 00:47:35,417
Yeah. Totally. I... You know, I'll make some calls.

875
00:47:35,461 --> 00:47:37,376
-You're not just saying that? -No.

876
00:47:40,814 --> 00:47:44,165
I had a feeling about you two. First two aside.

877
00:47:44,209 --> 00:47:47,690
You know? I know I can count on my new friends.

878
00:47:47,734 --> 00:47:48,909
And sorry about this all.

879
00:47:48,953 --> 00:47:51,042
Well, I'll mark it down as the usual...

880
00:47:51,085 --> 00:47:52,913
And give me feedback. Give me notes.

881
00:47:52,957 --> 00:47:54,872
I-I'm not precious, I collaborate.

00:47:57,613 --> 00:47:59,006
Uh...

884
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,538
You know, I've been thinking.

885
00:48:09,582 --> 00:48:12,411
When those guys first showed up and were gonna kill themselves

886
00:48:12,454 --> 00:48:15,240
in our bath tub, I was like, "Okay, t-this is crazy."

887
00:48:15,283 --> 00:48:17,503
And then when, you know, the more we learned about Storsh,

888
00:48:17,546 --> 00:48:19,374
I can see why these people follow him.

889
00:48:19,418 --> 00:48:21,072
You know, I mean, sure, it's not for everybody,

890
00:48:21,115 --> 00:48:22,943
but think about what good he's done for us

891
00:48:22,987 --> 00:48:24,423
and we're not even in his cult.

892
00:48:24,466 --> 00:48:26,425
Well, w-we can't be in a cult. We're from Ohio.

893
00:48:26,468 --> 00:48:27,992
Yeah, but, you know, when you think about it,

894
00:48:28,035 --> 00:48:29,732
all religions have good and bad.

895
00:48:29,776 --> 00:48:32,387
So, like, maybe we can just take the good from Storsh

896
00:48:32,431 --> 00:48:34,172
and, like, apply it to our own lives.

897
00:48:34,215 --> 00:48:36,000
Like, you know, the other day when you burned your finger

898
00:48:36,043 --> 00:48:37,827
on the glue gun, and you're like, "Oh, Jesus H. Christ,"

899
00:48:37,871 --> 00:48:39,220
but, like, you're not even a Christian.

900
00:48:39,264 --> 00:48:41,353
No, you listen, I'm totally good with having

901
00:48:41,396 --> 00:48:42,920
a little Storsh in our lives, I mean, it means

902
00:48:42,963 --> 00:48:44,922
a little more blood and violence, no biggie.

903
00:48:44,965 --> 00:48:46,749
But that's my point, you know, these poor souls

904
00:48:46,793 --> 00:48:48,795
work so hard to meet Storsh in the instantaneous eternity,

905
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:51,015
but they really have trouble with the-the, like,

906
00:48:51,058 --> 00:48:52,103
the final commitment, you know?

907
00:48:52,146 --> 00:48:53,147
It's like Cartwright said,

908
00:48:53,191 --> 00:48:54,322
"How many chances do you have

909
00:48:54,366 --> 00:48:55,758
to practice your own suicide?"

910
00:48:55,802 --> 00:48:57,325
-They totally suck at suicide. -Yeah.

911
00:48:57,369 --> 00:48:58,979
-Yeah. -So this is what I'm thinking.

912
00:48:59,023 --> 00:49:00,981
You know, it's our apartment, so what's, what's wrong

913
00:49:01,025 --> 00:49:03,679
with helping our visitors with a quick, clean transition

914
00:49:03,723 --> 00:49:05,159
into the instantaneous eternity?

915
00:49:05,203 --> 00:49:07,031
Helping our visitors is the least we can do.

916
00:49:07,074 --> 00:49:09,076
It is the least we can do. This is our home.

917
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,992
This is our temple. It's the reason we left Ohio.

918
00:49:12,036 --> 00:49:14,647
To serve the good word of Storsh.

919
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:17,215
Reginald E. Storsh, Claire. I love you.

920
00:49:17,258 --> 00:49:19,739

and Fred, uh, Fred Burm-Burm,

00:51:57,766 --> 00:52:00,073
that he was gonna give it to Wesley and that he was gonna

976
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,640

977
00:52:01,683 --> 00:52:03,032

-No. -You gotta be lying!

979
00:52:08,777 --> 00:52:10,997
He said those words? Fred Burminton said that?

980
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,955
Uh, yeah, absolutely. He...

981
00:52:12,999 --> 00:52:14,914
-You, I told you about... -She told...

982
00:52:14,957 --> 00:52:16,829
I... He, he definitely did.

983
00:52:16,872 --> 00:52:18,700
Well, here we go!

984
00:52:20,093 --> 00:52:22,051
-Yeah. -This is it!

985
00:52:22,095 --> 00:52:23,749
Oh, uh, uh, tell him, uh,

986
00:52:23,792 --> 00:52:25,751
I'm gonna take the thing about the super soldiers out.

987
00:52:25,794 --> 00:52:27,970
Uh, my sister's boyfriend is a bloom operator

988
00:52:28,014 --> 00:52:30,147
on General Hospital and he said, um,

989
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:31,931
that that technically makes it sci-fi,

990
00:52:31,974 --> 00:52:33,933
which is an issue in Germany, uh,

991
00:52:33,976 --> 00:52:36,022
and I wanted this to play internationally.

992
00:52:36,065 --> 00:52:38,198
I can't believe I just said that.

993
00:52:38,242 --> 00:52:40,548
Okay, so then, no super soldiers.

994
00:52:40,592 --> 00:52:41,593
Got it.

995
00:52:41,636 --> 00:52:43,072
Claire, you are amazing.

996
00:52:43,116 --> 00:52:45,640
Oh, oh... Oh...

997
00:52:48,252 --> 00:52:50,950
Thank you.

998
00:52:50,993 --> 00:52:53,909
-Oh, that's... Tha-that happens. -Hey...

999
00:53:06,966 --> 00:53:08,533
Claire.

1000
00:53:08,576 --> 00:53:10,752
Ms. Nordheim. What are you doing here?

1001
00:53:10,796 --> 00:53:12,537
I just came from a fundraising dinner.

1002
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:14,756
We made a record raise.

1003
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,671
You managed to turn my whole campaign around, Claire.

1004
00:53:16,715 --> 00:53:18,456
I wanted to thank you.

1005
00:53:19,805 --> 00:53:22,851
Oh. Wow, that is so sweet of you.

1006
00:53:22,895 --> 00:53:26,420
I'm gonna have to start drinking wine.

1007
00:53:26,464 --> 00:53:29,423
Well, well, well. What a beauty.

1008
00:53:29,467 --> 00:53:31,425
I am impressed, Claire. Is it yours?

1009
00:53:31,469 --> 00:53:34,733
Oh. Yeah, the birdhouse? My, uh, my boyfriend makes 'em.

1010
00:53:34,776 --> 00:53:36,909
Hm. Well.

1011
00:53:38,432 --> 00:53:39,738
I'll tell you what, Claire.

1012
00:53:39,781 --> 00:53:41,261
I am in the market

1013
00:53:41,305 --> 00:53:42,784
of furry birdhouse.

1014
00:53:42,828 --> 00:53:44,699
I would love to meet the artist.

1015
00:53:44,743 --> 00:53:47,093
Oh, I'm-I'm sure Paul would be thrilled.

1016
00:53:47,136 --> 00:53:49,878
I-I would, I'd be happy to make the connection for you.

1017
00:53:49,922 --> 00:53:51,837
I... We'll have to do that sometime.

1018
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,230
How about now?

1019
00:54:02,282 --> 00:54:03,588
Oh, uh...

1020
00:54:05,154 --> 00:54:07,069
We're still moving in, so...

1021
00:54:08,854 --> 00:54:12,205
Can I, uh, offer you anything?

1022
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:15,774
-Are these the birdhouses? -Oh, yeah, th-those are them.

1023
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:20,082
Where's the boyfriend? He around?

1024
00:54:20,126 --> 00:54:22,041
He must be out, which is...

1025
00:54:22,084 --> 00:54:23,477
You know, and he pretty much never goes out,

1026
00:54:23,521 --> 00:54:25,044
so it's kinda weird.

1027
00:54:25,087 --> 00:54:26,872
-I'm gonna paint one of those. -Oh.

1028
00:54:26,915 --> 00:54:30,658
I've always wanted to dive head first into the arts.

1029
00:54:32,051 --> 00:54:33,008
Hm.

1030
00:54:36,751 --> 00:54:39,841
I like you, Claire. Frankly, I see myself in you.

1031
00:54:39,885 --> 00:54:41,843
And I'm sure my upbringing wasn't that different from you

1032
00:54:41,887 --> 00:54:43,628
other than, you know...

1033
00:54:45,804 --> 00:54:47,240
I look like this.

1034
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,155
And I realized pretty quickly, that as a woman,

1035
00:54:49,198 --> 00:54:51,766
you have tremendous power.

1036
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:52,985
Have you ever felt the kind of power

1037
00:54:53,028 --> 00:54:54,116
that I'm talking about, Claire?

1038
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,379
Oh, you know, o-once I played

1039
00:54:55,422 --> 00:54:57,294
the Powerball and I won five dollars.

1040
00:54:57,337 --> 00:55:00,384
Yeah, that was pretty cool.

1041
00:55:00,427 --> 00:55:02,777
So I figured if these men are gonna have their way with me,

1042
00:55:02,821 --> 00:55:05,040
then I'm gonna have my way with them.

1043
00:55:05,084 --> 00:55:08,566
Armund was 82 when I married him.

1044
00:55:08,609 --> 00:55:12,352
Today he is 96.

1045
00:55:12,396 --> 00:55:15,137
Turns out, the old guy is built like a machine.

1046
00:55:15,181 --> 00:55:17,183
And he just keeps going

1047
00:55:17,226 --> 00:55:20,055
and going and going and going

1048
00:55:20,099 --> 00:55:23,407
and going and going and going and going and going!

1049
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:26,410
Point is, Claire, this young boyfriend of yours

1050
00:55:26,453 --> 00:55:29,021
who builds birdhouses, I am sure he's just peachy.

1051
00:55:29,064 --> 00:55:32,764
But you have got to take the power that is rightfully yours.

1052
00:55:32,807 --> 00:55:34,940
You've got to milk this world for everything

1053
00:55:34,983 --> 00:55:36,376
that it has to give.

1054
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:40,424
-You know, t-that must be Paul.

1055
00:55:40,467 --> 00:55:41,947
Oh.

1056
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:44,515
-Oh, my gosh. Mr. Nordheim!

1057
00:55:44,558 --> 00:55:47,300
Did-did you climb up all of those stairs?

1058
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,910
Are you okay? Here.

1059
00:55:48,954 --> 00:55:51,565
D-does he need, like, a defibrillator o-or something?

1060
00:55:51,609 --> 00:55:53,088
Uh, should I get him some water?

1061
00:55:53,132 --> 00:55:54,438
He's already had his water today.

1062
00:55:54,481 --> 00:55:56,396
Claire, let him go. Claire, he's fine.

1063
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,963
What I am trying to tell you is

1064
00:55:58,006 --> 00:56:00,095
that I have come here to liberate you

1065
00:56:00,139 --> 00:56:01,967
from the prison

1066
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:03,490
that you call love.

1067
00:56:03,534 --> 00:56:06,058
And, yes, it will be painful at first,

1068
00:56:06,101 --> 00:56:07,842
but eventually you're gonna thank me.

1069
00:56:07,886 --> 00:56:11,542
And I can't say that I'm not going to enjoy liberating you

1070
00:56:11,585 --> 00:56:13,413
by liberating Paul

1071
00:56:13,457 --> 00:56:16,155
the way I liberated that boy in the gym

1072
00:56:16,198 --> 00:56:19,463
over and over and over and over--

1073
00:56:19,506 --> 00:56:20,855
Oh, my God!

1074
00:56:20,899 --> 00:56:23,249
Oh, oh... Oh, my God! Ho!

1075
00:56:23,292 --> 00:56:25,382
I'll go get the first-aid kit.

1076
00:56:36,654 --> 00:56:38,699
Oh, I'm free. I'm free.

1077
00:56:38,743 --> 00:56:40,788
I am free. I am finally free!

1078
00:56:40,832 --> 00:56:42,442
Oh, my God. I'm finally free.

1079
00:56:42,486 --> 00:56:44,488
Thank you, thank you. Thank you, God, thank you.

1080
00:56:44,531 --> 00:56:46,925
I so deserved this. Thank you!

1081
00:56:46,968 --> 00:56:49,014
Thank you, thank you, thank you...

1082
00:56:49,057 --> 00:56:50,885
-Paul. -Oh, my gosh!

1083
00:56:50,929 --> 00:56:52,409
You're Meegan Nordheim.

1084
00:56:52,452 --> 00:56:55,499
Paul, I want you to liberate me.

1085
00:56:55,542 --> 00:56:57,152
Liberate me now.

1086
00:56:57,196 --> 00:56:59,241
-Uh, is Claire home? -Forget Claire!

1087
00:56:59,285 --> 00:57:01,722
There is no Claire. There is only you and there is me.

1088
00:57:01,766 --> 00:57:03,681
-Okay. I'll get the juice. -No, no, no...

1089
00:57:03,724 --> 00:57:05,509
Paul, come to me. Paul, I want my bliss now.

1090
00:57:05,552 --> 00:57:07,380
Please don't make me wait for it. Don't make me wait, Paul.

1091
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:09,208
Please, please, please, I want my bliss. Please, Paul, Paul...

1092
00:57:09,251 --> 00:57:10,470
Paul, please, now.

1093
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:13,168
-Oh... Okay, o-okay, okay. -Okay.

1094
00:57:23,962 --> 00:57:26,965
Oh, no. Paul, what did you do?

1095
00:57:27,008 --> 00:57:29,620
-I saved her. -What? Why?

1096
00:57:29,663 --> 00:57:31,796
She was a visitor. You said that we had to help them.

1097
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:33,624
No... Children of Storsh.

1098
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:35,016
Well, how was I supposed to know that?

1099
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:37,541
It's called logic, Paul!

1100
00:57:37,584 --> 00:57:39,456
-Oh, shoot! -My God!

1101
00:57:39,499 --> 00:57:42,154
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1102
00:57:42,197 --> 00:57:44,199
You let her paint the country house?

1103
00:57:44,243 --> 00:57:46,680
I'd hardly call that a country house.

1104
00:57:46,724 --> 00:57:48,290
No no no no no.

1105
00:57:48,334 --> 00:57:49,683
Country house, Boyd house,

1106
00:57:49,727 --> 00:57:51,250
complete with a little front-porch swing

1107
00:57:51,293 --> 00:57:53,382
and a bird-watching tower for watching birds.

1108
00:57:53,426 --> 00:57:55,733
Looks more like a fire station.

1109
00:57:55,776 --> 00:57:57,952
What kind of fire station has a porch swing?

1110
00:57:57,996 --> 00:57:59,867
Forget about the birdhouse, Paul.

1111
00:57:59,911 --> 00:58:01,913
We gotta deal with this now, okay?

1112
00:58:01,956 --> 00:58:03,871
No, no, no. She's-she's... It's gonna be fine.

1113
00:58:03,915 --> 00:58:06,265
I mean, she's still alive. Everything's, everything's okay.

1114
00:58:06,308 --> 00:58:07,875
She's gonna tell everyone what you did

1115
00:58:07,919 --> 00:58:09,007
and you're gonna go to jail!

1116
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:10,965
How can you be so stupid?

1117
00:58:14,621 --> 00:58:15,579
Paul!

1118
00:58:21,585 --> 00:58:23,500
I'm sorry, Ms. Nordheim.

1119
00:58:23,543 --> 00:58:25,806
Not the fire station.

1120
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:27,982
It's a country house.

1121
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:46,305
Cartwright's on his way.

1122
00:58:48,089 --> 00:58:50,570
What are you gonna tell him?

1123
00:58:50,614 --> 00:58:51,963
A story.

1124
00:58:54,008 --> 00:58:55,662
A love story

1125
00:58:55,706 --> 00:58:57,969
about a woman who married a man

1126
00:58:58,012 --> 00:58:59,927
for all of the right reasons,

1127
00:58:59,971 --> 00:59:02,321
and not for his money and-and not for his power,

1128
00:59:02,364 --> 00:59:05,759
but because she saw who he really was.

1129
00:59:05,803 --> 00:59:07,761
A man who needed her

1130
00:59:07,805 --> 00:59:10,634
more than she needed him.

1131
00:59:10,677 --> 00:59:12,810
It started out as a pure kind of love,

1132
00:59:12,853 --> 00:59:16,683
but it quickly became something else.

1133
00:59:16,727 --> 00:59:20,644
An obligation, not for her, but for him.

1134
00:59:22,341 --> 00:59:25,736
For her it was never a romantic kind of love.

1135
00:59:25,779 --> 00:59:28,565
It was a friend kind of love.

1136
00:59:28,608 --> 00:59:31,219
She knew that if she left him,

1137
00:59:31,263 --> 00:59:33,613
it would destroy him.

1138
00:59:33,657 --> 00:59:37,617
So she stayed by his side and hoped that he would realize

1139
00:59:37,661 --> 00:59:40,228
that he bet on the wrong horse.

1140
00:59:41,621 --> 00:59:43,362
But he never did.

1141
00:59:44,711 --> 00:59:47,845
So she was trapped...

1142
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,500
until she found Storsh.

1143
00:59:53,328 --> 00:59:55,417
What she never found in her marriage,

1144
00:59:55,461 --> 00:59:58,899
she found in the open arms of Storsh and his followers,

1145
00:59:58,943 --> 01:00:01,162
seekers of the instantaneous eternity,

1146
01:00:01,206 --> 01:00:03,208
that one brief moment of bliss

1147
01:00:03,251 --> 01:00:05,906
that can go on for forever.

1148
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:08,692
Armund was so distraught, so devastated

1149
01:00:08,735 --> 01:00:11,085
by the loss of his one true love

1150
01:00:11,129 --> 01:00:13,392
that he sought to follow her.

1151
01:00:13,435 --> 01:00:14,872
He'd rather die in her arms

1152
01:00:14,915 --> 01:00:17,265
than live without her for one more day.

1153
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:21,574
Wow.

1154
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:23,358
Gosh, darn it, Claire.

1155
01:00:25,099 --> 01:00:27,449
I have to say something to you right now.

1156
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:32,585
You-you know what? We had a problem, right?

1157
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,021
And what do we do?

1158
01:00:34,065 --> 01:00:35,762
-We sorted it. -Uh-huh.

1159
01:00:35,806 --> 01:00:38,765
This problem is sorted. It's sorted.

1160
01:00:38,809 --> 01:00:40,680
And it's not just this problem, it's everything, our...

1161
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:42,464
The-the apartment, your job, my job.

1162
01:00:42,508 --> 01:00:46,251
We... we are, are sorted.

1163
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:53,824
What are you doing?

1164
01:00:53,867 --> 01:00:54,999
Listen...

1165
01:00:56,870 --> 01:01:01,396
Claire Annabelle McKenty, will you, will you marry me?

1166
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,225
Y-you're doing this right now?

1167
01:01:04,269 --> 01:01:06,706
No, I know, I know I said I wouldn't ask again

1168
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:08,229
until we got our-our stuff figured out.

1169
01:01:08,273 --> 01:01:11,015
But guess what? We did! We did!

1170
01:01:11,058 --> 01:01:12,277
I wanna be with you forever, Claire.

1171
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,410
I want... I need you to marry me.

1172
01:01:15,454 --> 01:01:17,978
-Oh, well, okay... -Okay.

1173
01:01:19,501 --> 01:01:22,809

D-did we get any visitors?

1196
01:02:47,633 --> 01:02:50,941
Oh, no. No, it's been pretty quiet.

1197
01:02:54,118 --> 01:02:56,729
Y-you know, I was thinking, maybe we could go for a walk

1198
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,470
in the neighborhood and then when we get back,

1199
01:02:58,513 --> 01:03:01,473
we could play some shrabes.

1200
01:03:01,516 --> 01:03:06,478
I was kinda hoping for like a Storshy kind of evening.

1201
01:03:06,521 --> 01:03:07,827
So...

1202
01:03:29,414 --> 01:03:30,545
Go for Cartwright.

1203
01:03:30,589 --> 01:03:33,461
Detective, hey. It's Claire.

1204
01:03:33,505 --> 01:03:35,681
Claire, got any news for me?

1205
01:03:35,724 --> 01:03:39,293
News? Oh! Yeah! You know, I...

1206
01:03:39,337 --> 01:03:41,252
Uh, I, uh, heard from Snipes

1207
01:03:41,295 --> 01:03:43,689
and he loved the script, so...

1208
01:03:43,732 --> 01:03:46,083
You're kidding. Are you kidding?

1209
01:03:46,126 --> 01:03:49,477
No, I'm, I wouldn't, I wouldn't kid with you, Boyce-boy.

1210
01:03:49,521 --> 01:03:51,871
Uh, uh, please hold one...

1211
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:02,403
Yeah!

1212
01:04:02,447 --> 01:04:04,884
Yeah! Yeah!

1213
01:04:04,928 --> 01:04:08,018
Yeah!

1214
01:04:19,203 --> 01:04:21,161
Ah, that's such a good news.

1215
01:04:21,205 --> 01:04:22,859
Claire, this is huge.

1216
01:04:22,902 --> 01:04:25,078
I should, I gotta put in notice with my captain, right?

1217
01:04:25,122 --> 01:04:27,037
Because I can't work active cases if I'm gonna be on set.

1218
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,169
Is he gonna want a producer credit? 'Cause I...

1219
01:04:29,213 --> 01:04:31,084
Between you and me, he doesn't deserve anything

1220
01:04:31,128 --> 01:04:33,913
more than associate executive producer.

1221
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:35,436
Hey, uh, question for you.

1222
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,221
Anything, Claire, shoot.

1223
01:04:37,264 --> 01:04:39,136
We haven't had a cult member in a while

1224
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:41,747
and I just wondered, like, is there some sort of, like,

1225
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:43,488
Storsh holiday that we're not aware of?

1226
01:04:43,531 --> 01:04:46,360
Like a, like a suicide Yom Kippur?

1227
01:04:46,404 --> 01:04:49,929
Oh, well, it hasn't been that long, it's three days ago.

1228
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:51,975
Oh, yeah, okay, cool, no, it just seems like

1229
01:04:52,018 --> 01:04:53,672
there should've been one by now.

1230
01:04:53,715 --> 01:04:55,935
Actually, uh, a few years ago, there was a dry spell

1231
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:57,676
that lasted six months.

1232
01:04:57,719 --> 01:05:00,897
I mean, I thought it was over,

1233
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:03,203
but then it all started up again.

1234
01:05:03,247 --> 01:05:07,164
Uh, eventually, Claire, they always come back.

1235
01:05:07,207 --> 01:05:09,296
That's what you gotta understand about these people.

1236
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:12,430
If it helps, think of yourself as switching places

1237
01:05:12,473 --> 01:05:14,823
with me narratively.

1238
01:05:14,867 --> 01:05:16,913
You know, you're becoming kind of the lonely beat cop

1239
01:05:16,956 --> 01:05:19,176
in the wasteland of death,

1240
01:05:19,219 --> 01:05:21,656
I'm becoming the Hollywood screenwriter.

1241
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:24,790
Hey, Claire, do you think

1242
01:05:24,833 --> 01:05:26,966
that a guy like me

1243
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:30,404
would be able to pen a romcom,

1244
01:05:30,448 --> 01:05:31,971
a romantic comedy?

1245
01:05:32,015 --> 01:05:34,234
I had this story, you know what they say,

1246
01:05:34,278 --> 01:05:35,453
"Write what you know."

1247
01:05:35,496 --> 01:05:38,325
My ex-wife, she went to Ireland

1248
01:05:38,369 --> 01:05:40,980
o-once and she just never came back,

1249
01:05:41,024 --> 01:05:43,591
and e-eventually we divorced through the mail

1250
01:05:43,635 --> 01:05:45,637
and it was, it was kinda like a Lake House

1251
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,900
meets, um, Lady And The Tramp.

1252
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:51,164
Because we were really better friends

1253
01:05:51,208 --> 01:05:54,689
through letters that when w-when we were sharing a bed.

1254
01:05:54,733 --> 01:05:57,257
And then I eventually, you know, started talking

1255
01:05:57,301 --> 01:05:59,477
to her new husband.

1256
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,044
Um, he's a firefighter.

1257
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:03,655
Uh, I mean, and Irish firefighter, you gotta...

1258
01:06:03,698 --> 01:06:05,178
It's pretty cool. Like, like...

1259
01:06:05,222 --> 01:06:07,050
As-as much as I don't wanna admit it, like,

1260
01:06:07,093 --> 01:06:09,182
that's pretty much a manlier occupation.

1261
01:06:09,226 --> 01:06:12,272
I mean, an the Irish already fight everything.

1262
01:06:12,316 --> 01:06:14,100
This guy fights fire.

1263
01:06:14,144 --> 01:06:16,624
Uh, , I-I-I just thought, like,

1264
01:06:16,668 --> 01:06:18,670
kind of a, like a triangle thing

1265
01:06:18,713 --> 01:06:21,673
with like Matthew McConaughey, uh,

1266
01:06:21,716 --> 01:06:24,067
Kate Hudson and maybe like Wesley Snipes.

1267
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:27,026
If he gets one on this one...

1268
01:06:38,777 --> 01:06:41,171
Okay, so listen, Nordheim wasn't in the cult.

1269
01:06:41,214 --> 01:06:42,868
-But we saved her anyway. -Well, she needed to be saved.

1270
01:06:42,911 --> 01:06:44,783
-She wanted to kill puppies. -Exactly.

1271
01:06:44,826 --> 01:06:46,393
So before we were saving people

1272
01:06:46,437 --> 01:06:48,308
into the instantaneous eternity who wanted to be saved,

1273
01:06:48,352 --> 01:06:50,136
but maybe we save people who need to be saved

1274
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:51,485
that don't even know they need to be saved.

1275
01:06:51,529 --> 01:06:52,530
That's great, like murderers

1276
01:06:52,573 --> 01:06:54,227
and rapists or celebrity chefs.

1277
01:06:54,271 --> 01:06:57,013
Exactly. Okay. Let's do this.

1278
01:07:40,534 --> 01:07:44,060
It's a, um, new anti-depressant.

1279
01:07:44,103 --> 01:07:46,105
We have to sell people on getting happy

1280
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:48,673
because apparantly hopelessness and despair

1281
01:07:48,716 --> 01:07:50,979
are currently trending.

1282
01:07:51,023 --> 01:07:53,678
Mr. Carl, I've got this.

1283
01:07:58,770 --> 01:08:01,816
The only way to achieve complete happiness is...

1284
01:08:03,601 --> 01:08:07,126
by inviting the father and savior Storsh in to your heart.

1285
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:09,172
Now, I-I know, I know you're all looking at me

1286
01:08:09,215 --> 01:08:11,609
like you're a little skeptical, but believe me, I was too,

1287
01:08:11,652 --> 01:08:13,480
but, you know, you just, you just gotta go for it.

1288
01:08:13,524 --> 01:08:15,613
So, I-I'd love for you guys to join.

1289
01:08:15,656 --> 01:08:17,615
You know, just a bunch of like-minded people

1290
01:08:17,658 --> 01:08:20,008
who wanna be as happy as they can be.

1291
01:08:21,706 --> 01:08:23,925
That's all very interesting.

1292
01:08:23,969 --> 01:08:26,406
And you've given us a lot to think about.

1293
01:08:30,671 --> 01:08:33,152
Stupid legs, stupid legs.

1294
01:08:33,196 --> 01:08:34,849
Stupid rigor-mortis legs!

1295
01:08:34,893 --> 01:08:37,156
Oh! Fuck!

1296
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:40,246
Claire! Claire! Thanks God you're home.

1297
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:43,206
Something terrible has happened. They shut down my website.

1298
01:08:43,249 --> 01:08:44,555
And my credit card was declined.

1299
01:08:44,598 --> 01:08:47,079
I was just so busy making birdhouses

1300
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:49,908
that I forgot to pay and then the bank was so far

1301
01:08:49,951 --> 01:08:52,171
that I didn't wanna walk and I spent all my money

1302
01:08:52,215 --> 01:08:53,999
on skittles and wood and thanks God...

1303
01:08:54,042 --> 01:08:56,741
Thanks God for you, Claire, thanks God for you.

1304
01:08:56,784 --> 01:08:58,525
Can you swap me 200 bucks?

1305
01:08:58,569 --> 01:09:01,528
They fired me, Paul! They fired me!

1306
01:09:01,572 --> 01:09:03,182
-We don't have jobs.

1307
01:09:03,226 --> 01:09:06,316
We are unsorted, Paul! We're unsorted!

1308
01:09:09,362 --> 01:09:12,322
What are we gonna do, Claire? What are we gonna do?

1309
01:09:12,365 --> 01:09:14,715
I love you. I love you. Uh...

1310
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:16,717
Yeah?

1311
01:10:55,816 --> 01:11:00,343
Claire Annabelle McKenty, you, will you marry me?

1312
01:11:12,398 --> 01:11:15,009
No.

1313
01:11:15,053 --> 01:11:16,968
I can't marry you.

1314
01:11:53,439 --> 01:11:55,572
Hello, Claire, my child.

1315
01:11:57,878 --> 01:12:01,360
-It's you. -It's me.

1316
01:12:01,404 --> 01:12:03,014
I-I can't believe it. You-you came.

1317
01:12:03,057 --> 01:12:04,276
They doubted you, but you came.

1318
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,540
Shh, quiet now. Let's not spoil it.

1319
01:12:07,584 --> 01:12:09,194
I just can't believe it.

1320
01:12:09,237 --> 01:12:11,109
You're actually, you're here i-in my tub.

1321
01:12:11,152 --> 01:12:12,545
Remember the thing about not spoiling it

1322
01:12:12,589 --> 01:12:14,155
that I just said six seconds ago?

1323
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:16,941
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sorry. I just...

1324
01:12:16,984 --> 01:12:19,509
Well, y-your teachings have changed my life.

1325
01:12:19,552 --> 01:12:21,511
-Mm-hmm. -It's just...

1326
01:12:21,554 --> 01:12:23,295
Things aren't working now and I don't know,

1327
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,341
I don't know where I've gone wrong.

1328
01:12:25,384 --> 01:12:27,386
Mm, tell you, when this whole thing started,

1329
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:30,389
I never thought it would spread further than my backyard.

1330
01:12:30,433 --> 01:12:32,304
Just a bunch of crazy loons dancing in the light

1331
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:36,003
of the instantaneous eternity over nachos and Fanta.

1332
01:12:36,047 --> 01:12:39,355
But soon the whole city became my backyard.

1333
01:12:39,398 --> 01:12:42,619
The beacon of Storsh was lit and the people came.

1334
01:12:44,055 --> 01:12:45,491
I know I did.

1335
01:12:45,535 --> 01:12:47,101
I know you know you did.

1336
01:12:47,145 --> 01:12:49,539
I was watching you from the afterlife.

1337
01:12:49,582 --> 01:12:53,107
You know, the spiritual reward for saving souls was incredible.

1338
01:12:53,151 --> 01:12:54,979
What a buzz! It's just like a tingle.

1339
01:12:55,022 --> 01:12:56,981
But soon that wasn't enough.

1340
01:12:57,024 --> 01:12:58,722
I needed to reach more of my children,

1341
01:12:58,765 --> 01:13:00,506
I needed the message to find the masses

1342
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:02,769
and save the souls of the entire world

1343
01:13:02,813 --> 01:13:05,119
like, on a God level.

1344
01:13:05,163 --> 01:13:09,472
You know, I, I made a plan and that plan was I'd get caught

1345
01:13:09,515 --> 01:13:11,648
and I'd become a media sensation.

1346
01:13:11,691 --> 01:13:14,128
Live out my days in some cushy, white-collared prison

1347
01:13:14,172 --> 01:13:15,739
like Bundy Romanson.

1348
01:13:15,782 --> 01:13:19,133
TV specials, conjugal visits.

1349
01:13:19,177 --> 01:13:21,440
So I let that cop catch me.

1350
01:13:21,484 --> 01:13:24,269
You know this guy, you know who I'm talking about?

1351
01:13:24,312 --> 01:13:25,923
-Cartwright? -Yeah.

1352
01:13:25,966 --> 01:13:28,055
Naturally, he screwed it all up and I got off.

1353
01:13:28,099 --> 01:13:29,753
But it turns out, getting away with it

1354
01:13:29,796 --> 01:13:32,190
was like some major power move.

1355
01:13:32,233 --> 01:13:33,670
Next thing, I'm this huge celebrity,

1356
01:13:33,713 --> 01:13:34,932
people following me around,

1357
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:36,324
"Oh, Storsh, have my baby.

1358
01:13:36,368 --> 01:13:37,891
Storsh, can I get a photo?

1359
01:13:37,935 --> 01:13:40,067
Storsh, can I get a photo of you and me

1360
01:13:40,111 --> 01:13:41,373
trying to make babies?"

1361
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,027
People offering me book deals,

1362
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:45,421
multiple book deals, like a three-book deal.

1363
01:13:45,464 --> 01:13:49,120
In the grocery store, people offering me cupcakes,

1364
01:13:49,163 --> 01:13:50,861
people... I mean, you name it.

1365
01:13:50,904 --> 01:13:53,298
I had an assistant...

1366
01:13:53,341 --> 01:13:55,431
for a little while.

1367
01:13:55,474 --> 01:13:57,433
But then I realized, "Oh, my God.

1368
01:13:57,476 --> 01:13:59,391
I could immortalize myself

1369
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,045
and forever spread the word of Storsh

1370
01:14:01,088 --> 01:14:04,483
with the ultimate saving. Who? Me, myself."

1371
01:14:04,527 --> 01:14:06,964
So I climbed in this bathtub here and I did my thing

1372
01:14:07,007 --> 01:14:10,663
and in one fell swoop, I became the god I was destined to be.

1373
01:14:12,099 --> 01:14:15,494
Oh, that is so beautiful.

1374
01:14:15,538 --> 01:14:18,323
Yeah, I guess it is.

1375
01:14:18,366 --> 01:14:21,282
But, you, Claire, you, my love.

1376
01:14:21,326 --> 01:14:23,154
None of my followers have served me

1377
01:14:23,197 --> 01:14:25,417
as greatly or lovingly as you.

1378
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:28,420
And yet, there is still one final lesson for you to learn.

1379
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,988
Oh, teach me. I-I want to learn.

1380
01:14:32,555 --> 01:14:35,514
You've been so focused on saving everyone else,

1381
01:14:35,558 --> 01:14:39,387
you've forgotten the most important person of all.

1382
01:14:39,431 --> 01:14:42,086
I-I'm sorry, what?

1383
01:14:42,129 --> 01:14:44,915
You've been so focused on saving everyone else,

1384
01:14:44,958 --> 01:14:48,527
you've forgotten the most important person of all.

1385
01:14:48,571 --> 01:14:49,746
I-I don't--

1386
01:14:49,789 --> 01:14:50,790
You've forgotten the most important

1387
01:14:50,834 --> 01:14:52,183
person of all.

1388
01:14:53,576 --> 01:14:56,927
Oh... Oh.

1389
01:14:56,970 --> 01:15:01,235
Yeah. I understand.

1390
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:03,934
I understand.

1391
01:15:06,545 --> 01:15:09,287
The door to my bus is always open, Claire.

1392
01:15:10,593 --> 01:15:11,942
Always open.

1393
01:15:50,328 --> 01:15:51,982
Hey, Cartwright.

1394
01:15:52,025 --> 01:15:56,116
I heard you're, uh, going off to make your movie.

1395
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,902
Yeah. Finally pulling it together.

1396
01:15:58,945 --> 01:16:00,599
-Oh.

1397
01:16:00,643 --> 01:16:02,035
I'll see you at the premiere.

1398
01:16:07,737 --> 01:16:09,042
Oh-ho ...

1399
01:16:11,654 --> 01:16:14,047
Ah, man, you're such a wiener.

1400
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:19,618
Oh, man.

1401
01:16:31,761 --> 01:16:33,110
Hey.

1402
01:16:33,153 --> 01:16:34,111
Hey.

1403
01:16:37,375 --> 01:16:39,116
Still wanna go to Winnipeg?

1404
01:16:39,159 --> 01:16:41,727
Not really.

1405
01:16:41,771 --> 01:16:43,337
Yeah, me neither.

1406
01:16:46,993 --> 01:16:48,691
And while you were in there talking to the bathtub,

1407
01:16:48,734 --> 01:16:51,476
I did some thinking.

1408
01:16:51,519 --> 01:16:53,696
Yeah?

1409
01:16:53,739 --> 01:16:57,656
The reason you never really married me.

1410
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:59,005
I get it.

1411
01:17:00,703 --> 01:17:01,965
You do?

1412
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,274
You love me.

1413
01:17:07,318 --> 01:17:11,148
It's just not a romantic kind of love.

1414
01:17:11,191 --> 01:17:13,106
It's a friend kind of love.

1415
01:17:14,107 --> 01:17:15,848
Oh, Paul...

1416
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:20,766
I'm sorry.

1417
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:23,508
For what?

1418
01:17:25,118 --> 01:17:27,338
That I'm not smart.

1419
01:17:27,381 --> 01:17:30,297
What? No. No.

1420
01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:33,605
You're the smartest guy I know.

1421
01:18:11,861 --> 01:18:14,428
This is the sloppiest tub death I've ever seen.

1422
01:18:18,563 --> 01:18:21,348
It's weird how they all have some kind of red dye

1423
01:18:21,392 --> 01:18:22,959
on their lips now.

1424
01:18:23,002 --> 01:18:24,917
Yeah, it's totally weird, right?

1425
01:18:30,793 --> 01:18:33,230
Her elderly, physically-decrypted husband

1426
01:18:33,273 --> 01:18:35,275
from whom she stands to inherit millions

1427
01:18:35,319 --> 01:18:37,582
somehow gets his walker up the flight of stairs.

1428
01:18:37,625 --> 01:18:39,366
That part's actually true.

1429
01:19:01,954 --> 01:19:05,088
What is that? This one.

1430
01:19:05,131 --> 01:19:08,961
That, that's the coffee shop where we had our first kiss.

1431
01:19:10,833 --> 01:19:13,096
What's this?

1432
01:19:13,139 --> 01:19:17,927
Uh, it's the pizza shop where I thought we had our first kiss.

1433
01:19:17,970 --> 01:19:19,232
Oh.

1434
01:19:19,276 --> 01:19:21,887
Apparently, I was mistaken.

1435
01:19:21,931 --> 01:19:23,584
Yeah.

1436
01:19:23,628 --> 01:19:25,282
What's this one? It's just a line.

1437
01:19:25,325 --> 01:19:28,720
No, no, no. See. This is, this is your butt.

1438
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:30,896
Oh.

1439
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:33,290
Which I do like very much.

1440
01:19:33,333 --> 01:19:36,032

1447
01:20:16,289 --> 01:20:17,638
I do.

1449
01:20:23,035 --> 01:20:24,167
I do.

Oh, Bloyce. I'm sorry. I-I thought you'd be done.

1451
01:21:57,390 --> 01:21:59,044
I was wrapping up.

I wish I can...

1453
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:03,875

Really? You wanna live here?

1459
01:22:22,807 --> 01:22:24,591
It's cheap and, uh,

01:22:24,635 --> 01:22:26,811
very conveniently located.

1461
01:22:26,854 --> 01:22:31,381
