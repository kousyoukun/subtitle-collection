killed himself in our bathtub.

not go over this with you

191
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:39,056

at the apartment?

You're looking wonderful.

-Oh, here you go.
-Oh, what's this?

198
00:09:51,112 --> 00:09:53,941
Oh, I always buy my tenants
a carrot cake

199
00:09:53,984 --> 00:09:57,509
for their first tub death.
It's just a little tradition.

-Save me a piece. [chuckles]

t-they're basically harmless.

204
00:10:07,215 --> 00:10:09,783
Their only goal
is an exit strategy.

205
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,352
Are they that different?
What am I doing?

206
00:10:14,396 --> 00:10:15,919
I really do have to go.

207

Hey! You can't just leave.

this mess night after night.

I planned to spend my evening?

I'm planned to be home
working on my screenplay.

detective character doesn't have

enough conflict.
I'm a detective.

It's a screenplay
about a detective.

216
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:40,378
There's conflict.

217
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:43,207
This industry is bullshit.

instead, I'm here.

in kill shelters.

I mean, who campaigns
on killing puppies?

00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:21,023
She's retained us at the rate of
50,000 a month.

-She has my full support.
-Our country needs her.

Yeah, well, she was up
in the polls as of last night,

301
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:27,247

because this morning

00:18:45,428 --> 00:18:48,953
must refile these charges
due to improper warrant

349
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:52,348
for the search and seizure of
evidence relating to the murder

350
00:18:52,392 --> 00:18:54,263
of Ms. Elizabeth Watson!"

351
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:56,831
-Watkins!
-[Barry] No!

352
00:18:56,874 --> 00:18:58,311
Watkins!

353
00:18:58,354 --> 00:19:00,356
It's kins! Dammit!

354
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,534
Who knows the book?
I know the book, Barry!

355
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:06,536
I can tell you this.

356
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,059
This is not over.

357
00:19:09,844 --> 00:19:11,150
Now that is how it's done.

358
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:12,499
What w-was that?

359
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:13,804
The challenge,

360
00:19:13,848 --> 00:19:17,373
and next talent.

361
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:20,550
What I Did Over Spring Break
by Danielle Carter.

362
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:24,641
"This summer, my mom and
step-dad took us all to Denmark.

363
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:28,036
We went to Legoland
and it was really cool.

364
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,039
There was a giant dragon
made from Legos

365
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:34,216
and they serve vanilla pudding
in the cafeteria.

366
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,524
My favorite thing about Legoland
was the hotel.

367
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:40,179
The bed was made
from giant Legos

368
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:43,269
and, uh, they serve pancakes
for breakfast.

369
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:46,010
In conclusion,
Legoland is a very good place

370
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:47,925
to go for your spring vacation.

371
00:19:47,969 --> 00:19:50,145
I recommend it highly

372
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,539
for friends and family alike."

373
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:55,106
That's great, that's,
seriously, that's a,

374
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,283
that's a really nice
piece of writing.

375
00:19:57,326 --> 00:19:59,154
Oh, I did... I got an A on it.

376
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,852
-Did you? Oh.
-Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

377
00:20:01,896 --> 00:20:06,553
Oh, well. Time for me to achieve
eternal bliss. [chuckles]

378
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:07,771
[water gurgling]

379
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:11,993
Oh, shit!

380
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:13,386
I forgot my knife.
Do you have a knife?

381
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:15,301
-A knife to kill yourself with?
-Yeah, yeah.

382
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:17,041
Well, I'm not gonna,
I don't want your blood and guts

383
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:18,391
all over one of my knives.
That's gross.

384
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:20,044
That's what dishwashers are for.

385
00:20:20,088 --> 00:20:21,307
Then I'm gonna think about what

386
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,656
you did with it
every time I use it.

387
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:23,787
Well, just put it in

388
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:25,049
amongst all the other knives

389
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:26,616
and then
you wouldn't even remember.

390
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,183
Then I-I'm gonna think about
that with all my knives.

391
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,837
Well, th-throw it away then.

392
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,665
So now I'm giving you a knife?

393
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,711
No. Is there anything else
I can provide you with?

394
00:20:34,755 --> 00:20:38,541
Maybe like a spoon
to scoop your eyeballs out

395
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:41,544
or maybe a cheese grater
to shave off your nipples?

396
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:44,243
Jesus! I don't appreciate
this kind of talk.

397
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:46,245
Well, I don't appreciate
a complete stranger

398
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:50,118
doing a suicide
in my bathtub. Ah!

399
00:20:50,161 --> 00:20:52,033
We haven't unpacked
the knives yet.

400
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:55,079
But you do have a screwdriver!

401
00:20:55,123 --> 00:20:58,126
No! No!

402
00:20:58,169 --> 00:20:59,649
[grunting]

403
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:03,523
Stop it! Claire! Help! Help me!

404
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:05,002
[grunting]

405
00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:06,656
-Oh, God!
-Oh!

406
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,397
-Oh, God.
-Oh!

407
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:10,747
What the fudge? You stabbed me!

408
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,183
[groaning]

409
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:14,403
Oh, my God! [gasping]

410
00:21:14,447 --> 00:21:16,840
-Oh, right in the spine.
-Oh, my God!

411
00:21:16,884 --> 00:21:18,233
Why did you shove her
like that?

412
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,670
-She was attacking you!
-No, she was...

413
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:22,455
She was trying to kill herself!
She's a cult member.

414
00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:24,544
[Danielle screaming]

415
00:21:24,587 --> 00:21:26,067
Stop screaming!

416
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,068
Ah! So loud!

417
00:21:27,111 --> 00:21:28,504
[Claire] Stop screaming!

418
00:21:28,548 --> 00:21:31,464
[groaning]

419
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:37,339
[gasping]

420
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:39,472
-Oh, God.
-Ah!

421
00:21:40,777 --> 00:21:43,345
He's never gonna believe us.

422
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:47,088
-Who?
-Th-that Detective Cartwright.

423
00:21:47,131 --> 00:21:48,350
-He's never gonna believe us.
-Why?

424
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:50,047
-Why wouldn't he believe us?
-Uh...

425
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:52,398
Uh, look around.
I mean... [stammers]

426
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:55,226
The screwdriver in her back and
there's blood on the wall and--

427
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,707
-Oh, my God! You're right!
-Oh, God!

428
00:21:57,751 --> 00:22:00,188
You're right!
What, what are we gonna do?

429
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:01,494
-Tell us what to do, Claire!
-I don't know.

430
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:02,712
-Tell us what to do!
-I don't know!

431
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:03,800
Just let me think, let me think,

432
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:05,324
let me think, please.

433
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:09,589
[dramatic music]

434
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:12,679
Change the story.

435
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,161
-[camera clicks]
-[indistinct radio chatter]

436
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:21,252
This is how we found her.

437
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:24,212
Yeah, she totally committed
self-murder in the bathtub.

438
00:22:24,255 --> 00:22:28,999
She stabbed herself in the back?

439
00:22:29,043 --> 00:22:31,567
I know. Right?

440
00:22:31,611 --> 00:22:34,222
This is the sloppiest tub death
I've ever seen.

441
00:22:34,265 --> 00:22:35,963
Yeah, 'cause how many times
do you get to practice

442
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:38,226
your own suicide?

443
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:40,184
Yes, that's actually
a good point.

444
00:22:40,228 --> 00:22:41,795
-'Cause he gets, he gets...
-Just in one shot.

445
00:22:41,838 --> 00:22:42,883
Yeah.

446
00:22:42,926 --> 00:22:44,014
[laughing]

447
00:22:44,058 --> 00:22:46,234
[indistinct chatter]

448
00:22:46,277 --> 00:22:49,106
Here comes Wallace on the
comedy bus five minutes late.

449
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,325
That's how humor works.

450
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,718
It's an involuntary reaction

451
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:52,719
when you find something funny.

452
00:22:52,762 --> 00:22:54,198
You can't fake it after you hear

453
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:56,375
two people laughing, you child.

454
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,292
[instrumental music]

455
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:07,690
You've been unpacking.

456
00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:10,345
You kids planning on staying?

457
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,347
Yeah, uh, you know,
it's a great location,

458
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,523
it's close to freeways.

459
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:17,178
Really?

460
00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:19,833
Y-you know, that really shows
some backbone.

461
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:23,706
To be honest, a lot of the
people just leave right away.

462
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,665
That's good.
Y-you're gonna like it.

463
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:27,362
There is a, um...

464
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,670
There is a nice pizza place
about three blocks up

465
00:23:30,713 --> 00:23:32,193
called Schneider's

466
00:23:32,236 --> 00:23:34,935
and they have a two-for-one deal

467
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:37,851
where you get a can of Pepsi
for free on weekdays.

468
00:23:37,894 --> 00:23:39,896
I don't know if you guys, uh,

469
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,856
like pizza. Everybody does.

470
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:45,467
-[Paul] O-oh.
-Oh, you...

471
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:48,818
Yeah, I... Well, we...
I have to, I have to work.

472
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:51,038
[stammers] I don't know
why you're telling me that.

473
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:52,692
I have work, too.
Everyone has work.

474
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:55,172
That's... Uh, why are you
telling me you have work?

475
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:56,739
-Is it non sequitur?
-Oh, no, I didn't mean--

476
00:23:56,783 --> 00:23:59,350
'Cause I wasn't asking you guys
to hang out with me.

477
00:23:59,394 --> 00:24:01,004
-I'm a police officer.
-Oh, of course.

478
00:24:01,048 --> 00:24:03,442
I'm a detective. I, I work.

479
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:04,921
Oh, no, I didn't mean--

480
00:24:04,965 --> 00:24:06,967
The job's frankly all I got.
[chuckles]

481
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:10,579
It's, uh... Which is probably
why I caught Storsh.

482
00:24:10,623 --> 00:24:12,407
He did not get away from me.

483
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,497
He got away from a department
with its head up its ass.

484
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:18,848
I was not the one
asleep at the switch.

485
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:21,372
[Claire] You know,
this Storsh character,

486
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:24,680
i-it's like, a lot of the stuff
in this book makes sense.

487
00:24:24,724 --> 00:24:26,508
You know, I mean,
some of it's crazy, obviously,

488
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:29,685
but some of it isn't.
Like, okay, for example...

489
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:32,514
One of the things is being
the best you you can be.

490
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:33,733
Well, I don't see
anything wrong with being

491
00:24:33,776 --> 00:24:34,908
the best you I can be.

492
00:24:34,951 --> 00:24:37,127
No, the best you youcan be.

493
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,130
That's what I said.

494
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:41,784
Okay. Um...

495
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:43,525
For example,
here's another really good one.

496
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:45,266
Uh... Oh, here. Listen to this.

497
00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:48,182
"When one liberates oneself from
the shackles of overthought,

498
00:24:48,225 --> 00:24:49,966
life can truly be free.

499
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,534
Open yourself to your inner will
and close the door

500
00:24:52,578 --> 00:24:54,623
on the addiction
to outside approval."

501
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:58,584
I mean, this is me at work.
I totally relate to this.

502
00:24:58,627 --> 00:25:00,673
Like, I'm always worried about
what other people are thinking.

503
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:01,978
I don't even know
what I'm thinking.

504
00:25:02,022 --> 00:25:04,111
This stuff really makes sense.

505
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,768
You know, I'm not smart
like you are, Claire.

506
00:25:08,811 --> 00:25:10,552
Oh, Paul.

507
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:14,164
But I don't have to be smart
because I've got you.

508
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:16,950
And-and now that we're casting
off the shackles of overthought,

509
00:25:16,993 --> 00:25:19,300
I swear my most deepest swear

510
00:25:19,343 --> 00:25:21,215
that I'm gonna get a job,

511
00:25:21,258 --> 00:25:23,696
like, as soon as possible.

512
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:26,568
New city, new Paul, new us.

513
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:28,657
-Oh, Paul.
-[grunting]

514
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:30,703
-I believe in you.
-Oh.

515
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:32,531
-I believe in you.
-Yeah?

516
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:36,360
Oh, I love you, my Claire.

517
00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:39,276
[upbeat music]

518
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:48,242
Claire, Claire, hi.
So we just got the call.

519
00:25:48,285 --> 00:25:50,331
Nordheim is coming in to see
what we have for the campaign.

520
00:25:50,374 --> 00:25:51,680
-Now?
-Yeah, now.

521
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,815
Ah. [grunts]

522
00:25:57,773 --> 00:25:59,688
[groaning]

523
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:06,521
We weren't expecting
Mr. Nordheim.

524
00:26:09,437 --> 00:26:11,134
-[grunting]
-Oh...

525
00:26:15,443 --> 00:26:18,707
Well, we were thinking,

526
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:22,798
what if you were to repent.

527
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:24,017
The religious angle.

528
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,672
-You find Jesus.
-I'm Jewish.

529
00:26:26,715 --> 00:26:30,066
Obviously you did a workup on me
and you already know that.

530
00:26:32,112 --> 00:26:34,810
[snaps finger] Okay.

531
00:26:34,854 --> 00:26:36,464
We put a story in the paper

532
00:26:36,507 --> 00:26:39,554
that the young man
with whom you had relations

533
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,383
is actually a con artist

534
00:26:42,426 --> 00:26:44,559
preying on...

535
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:50,434
Preying on?

536
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,002
Praying...

537
00:26:55,091 --> 00:26:57,398
Tony, why don't you take
this one since it's your idea?

538
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:02,446
Sure. Uh... [chuckles]

539
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:07,190
Um, uh... I see sort of like a,
uh,

540
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:09,453
a basketball player,
but instead of legs,

541
00:27:09,497 --> 00:27:13,544
um, it's got tang threads.
So, like a ro...

542
00:27:13,588 --> 00:27:15,459
Ro... [clears throat]

543
00:27:17,766 --> 00:27:20,595
Okay, I'm gonna speak now.

544
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:24,425
I am not impressed
with any of this.

545
00:27:24,468 --> 00:27:26,340
And if this is all you have,
I'm going to be

546
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:30,213
very, very, very disappointed.

547
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,785
I have an idea.

548
00:27:42,748 --> 00:27:44,358
[exhales]

549
00:27:51,452 --> 00:27:54,281
[Paul] What exactly would
you say your strengths are?

550
00:27:54,324 --> 00:27:57,806
Well, uh, first and foremost,
I am a people-pleaser.

551
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,939
-Pe-people like me.
-Well, I don't like you.

552
00:27:59,982 --> 00:28:03,116
And I have a hard time
seeing how anyone would.

553
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:04,726
Please, just, sir,
just give me a chance.

554
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,511
Do you even know
what it is we do here?

555
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:10,514
Y-y-you guys design
roller coasters, right?

556
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:12,299
Well, you managed
to get that right.

557
00:28:12,342 --> 00:28:15,606
How many years of mechanical
engineering do you have?

558
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,565
No, no, no, no. I'm sorry.
Listen.

559
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:19,306
Listen, I really need this job.

560
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:20,960
My girlfriend said that
I-I have to get my job thing

561
00:28:21,003 --> 00:28:22,135
sorted or we can never
get married.

562
00:28:22,178 --> 00:28:24,354
-Uh! Your girlfriend?
-Yeah.

563
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:27,227
You're in here wasting my time
because of your girlfriend?

564
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,358
-No, no, please--
-I'm shocked...

565
00:28:28,402 --> 00:28:30,578
You even have a girlfriend.

566
00:28:30,621 --> 00:28:31,927
I wouldn't be surprised
if she leaves you

567
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:33,712
by the end of the week because

568
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:36,584
there is no job for you here

569
00:28:36,627 --> 00:28:38,717
or anywhere in this city.

570
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:42,285
-No...
-Now get out of my office!

571
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:44,331
[sobbing softly]

572
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:47,987
[grunts]

573
00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:51,425
[breathing heavily]

574
00:28:53,122 --> 00:28:56,038
[bird humming]

575
00:29:00,434 --> 00:29:03,524
Hi, Paul. Why so glumy, chummy?

576
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,358
I can't get a job.

577
00:29:12,838 --> 00:29:15,797
No one will hire me.

578
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:18,234
Uh, not after what happened
in Ohio.

579
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:20,541
What's the what in Ohio, huh?

580
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,242
[Claire] Okay.

581
00:29:26,286 --> 00:29:28,549
Did you know
that in 33% of marriages

582
00:29:28,592 --> 00:29:30,029
somebody commits infidelity?

583
00:29:30,072 --> 00:29:32,901
And that's only the ones
who admitted, so...

584
00:29:32,945 --> 00:29:36,078
So you were caught having
a little fun on the side.

585
00:29:36,122 --> 00:29:39,081
I'm sure every woman in America
would understand

586
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,692
if you just put it into context.
Yeah.

587
00:29:41,736 --> 00:29:44,565
What context is that?

588
00:29:44,608 --> 00:29:46,132
Let's break the shackles
of approval

589
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:50,484
and show everyone
it's okay to be the real you.

590
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:52,616
I made this thing. It's a...

591
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,531
Really, a-all you need to do is

592
00:29:54,575 --> 00:29:58,144
show these, these two pictures
side-by-side

593
00:29:58,187 --> 00:30:00,537
and then simply ask...

594
00:30:03,062 --> 00:30:05,238
"Come on. Wouldn't you?"

595
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:12,549
"Come on. Wouldn't you?"

596
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,205
Come on. Wouldn't you?

597
00:30:19,905 --> 00:30:21,297
Come on.

598
00:30:23,517 --> 00:30:26,912
Wouldn't you?
[laughing] I mean...

599
00:30:27,956 --> 00:30:30,002
Come on. Come on!

600
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:32,831
[laughing]

601
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,051
Come on. Wouldn't you?

602
00:30:36,095 --> 00:30:38,662
-Come on. Wouldn't you?
-Come on. Wouldn't you?

603
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:40,142
[Meegan] Come on. Wouldn't you?
-Come on. Wouldn't you?

604
00:30:40,186 --> 00:30:42,666
-Come on. Wouldn't you?

614
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,340
This one time last year...

615
00:31:04,384 --> 00:31:07,909
I stayed up really late to watch
The Storage Warsmarathon.

616
00:31:07,953 --> 00:31:10,520
It's a really awesome show
because I like stuff

617
00:31:10,564 --> 00:31:12,914
about storage units.

618
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,785
Anyway, I was gonna go to bed,
but then I remembered

619
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:16,352
that Claire had asked me
to do the laundry,

620
00:31:16,396 --> 00:31:17,876
so I stayed up
for the rest of the night

621
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,921
and did the laundry.

622
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:22,097
Um, but then, then,

623
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:23,490
the-the dryer didn't finish
in time,

624
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:25,013
and I had to go to my job

625
00:31:25,057 --> 00:31:28,016
at the water filtration plant.

626
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:31,759
And so I just wore
my uniform damp.

627
00:31:31,802 --> 00:31:36,111
But then on my walk to work, um,
I got really, really cold.

628
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:41,334
And I couldn't stop shivering,
so I stopped at the gas station

629
00:31:41,377 --> 00:31:43,945
and got a Mountain Dew.

630
00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:47,035
And when I got to work, I tried
to heat the Mountain,

631
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:50,386
Mountain Dew up on a hot plate.

632
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,649
But then the plastic melted

633
00:31:52,693 --> 00:31:56,566
and-and, and then the melted
plastic and the Mountain Dew

634
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,959
got all over my hands

635
00:31:58,003 --> 00:32:01,963
and I knocked over
a can of turpentine

636
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:03,573
and that mixed
with some oldie peanuts

637
00:32:03,617 --> 00:32:06,185
and then that dripped
into the filtration fluids.

638
00:32:06,228 --> 00:32:10,667
[sniffles] And then the,
the melty Mountain-Dewie plastic

639
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:13,714
and the, and the mold
and the turpentine

640
00:32:13,757 --> 00:32:16,717
all mixed together and made
some w-weird chemical reaction

641
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:21,330
and-and then that... that got
into the town's water supply.

642
00:32:23,071 --> 00:32:26,901
[sobbing] And the entire town
lost their hair.

643
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:30,731
All their hair.

644
00:32:30,774 --> 00:32:33,864
Their arms and their legs
and their eyebrows.

645
00:32:33,908 --> 00:32:38,608
And then... and then
about half the town,

646
00:32:38,652 --> 00:32:40,915
let's say, about 80,000 people,

647
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,874
got rage madness and they
started foaming at the mouth

648
00:32:43,918 --> 00:32:46,051
and attacking each other
for no reason.

649
00:32:46,094 --> 00:32:49,271
And then the whole town
became a war zone.

650
00:32:49,315 --> 00:32:52,318
And we had to stay inside,
but everybody got so hungry.

651
00:32:52,361 --> 00:32:54,450
But then the rage people
stole all the food

652
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:57,018
and they, they hid it
in a used tire yard.

653
00:32:57,062 --> 00:33:01,457
And they built this massive fort
out of used tires.

654
00:33:01,501 --> 00:33:04,330
It was like a beehive,
and then they stayed in,

655
00:33:04,373 --> 00:33:06,201
in the tire hive
and they wouldn't come out.

656
00:33:06,245 --> 00:33:07,811
And so then all the [stammering]

657
00:33:07,855 --> 00:33:09,639
then the normal people
burned down the tire hive.

658
00:33:09,683 --> 00:33:12,555
But then the fire,
the fire burned for months

659
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:15,689
because it was just
millions of used tires.

660
00:33:15,732 --> 00:33:17,734
[sobbing] And then
we all had to go to the woods

661
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:19,345
and hunt for animals.

662
00:33:19,388 --> 00:33:21,347
But it was the summer
and, and it was so hot

663
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:24,132
and we all took off
all of our, our clothes

664
00:33:24,176 --> 00:33:26,265
and then we ran out of bullets.

665
00:33:26,308 --> 00:33:29,616
And so there's just a bunch
of hairless naked people

666
00:33:29,659 --> 00:33:32,880
running around the woods,
hunting for deer

667
00:33:32,923 --> 00:33:36,231
and raccoons and squirrels
with our bare hands.

668
00:33:36,275 --> 00:33:39,234
And then, t-then everyone

669
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:42,672
got really hungry again
'cause we ran out of animals.

670
00:33:42,716 --> 00:33:47,068
And then... then you couldn't
tell the normal people

671
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:48,852
from the rage people

672
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:51,681
and-and you couldn't tell
who was who.

673
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:53,292
And then a militia came
from another state

674
00:33:53,335 --> 00:33:55,337
and they called us all
s-skinners

675
00:33:55,381 --> 00:33:58,166
and th-they hunted us for sport.

676
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:01,387
And then the National Guard
came to fight the militia

677
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:04,085
and then the government
sent in the army

678
00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:06,479
[sobbing] to rescue us all

679
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:09,525
and then when it was all done...

680
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:12,354
they told me I couldn't go back
to Ohio anymore.

681
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,966
[sobbing]

682
00:34:18,404 --> 00:34:20,232
Oh, Paul.

683
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:22,756
Sounds like you've been
on quite the journey.

684
00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:24,410
But your true journey of bliss

685
00:34:24,453 --> 00:34:26,499
found
on the instantaneous eternity

686
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:29,415
only begins
when you change your story.

687
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:32,374
It's time to loose the Os
in Ohio

688
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:34,942
and say hito the new Paul,

689
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:38,989
a Paul who's his own boss,
a Paul who answers to Paul.

690
00:34:39,033 --> 00:34:40,513
To-to me?

691
00:34:40,556 --> 00:34:42,123
[Bird] It's like
the Book Of Storiessays.

692
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:45,518
The only thing you've to worry
about is what you think.

693
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:48,303
If there's no job for you,
make your own job.

694
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:52,264
Be like me. Be free.
Free like a bird, bird.

695
00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:56,398
Free? Like a bird, bird?

696
00:34:56,442 --> 00:34:57,704
[birds chirping]

697
00:34:57,747 --> 00:34:59,749
[whispers] Like a bird, bird.

698
00:35:00,663 --> 00:35:01,838
Yeah.

699
00:35:08,976 --> 00:35:10,282
-[doorknob rattles]
-[Claire] Hey-hey!

700
00:35:10,325 --> 00:35:13,067
-Hey!
-I had the best day.

701
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,851
Me, too.
I had, I have huge news.

702
00:35:14,895 --> 00:35:16,114
Oh, okay. You first.

703
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:17,767
So I-I slammed the door

704
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:19,160
on the jackals of over-thoughts.

705
00:35:19,204 --> 00:35:20,683
Just like you said,
I've been so worried

706
00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:22,076
about what everyone else thinks
I should be

707
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,078
that I forgot what I want to be.

708
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,906
Oh, well, that-that's amazing.
What do you wanna be, Paul?

709
00:35:25,949 --> 00:35:28,169
A bird housemaker.

710
00:35:28,213 --> 00:35:30,606
I make birdhouses now.

711
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,695
Come, come, come.

712
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:35,307
Oh, wow!
You, you made all of these?

713
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,917
Yeah, I'm in the zone.

714
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,919
Look, so this one's
a little pool house, right?

715
00:35:38,962 --> 00:35:40,747
And it's got a little lounge
chair, a little changing room

716
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,531
where the birds can change
out of their red clothes.

717
00:35:42,575 --> 00:35:44,185
A simple
mother-daughter apartment

718
00:35:44,229 --> 00:35:46,013
for when mom gets really old
and she could die,

719
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:47,493
she could die at any moment.

720
00:35:47,536 --> 00:35:48,711
There's a little
mechanical chair

721
00:35:48,755 --> 00:35:50,191
that goes up and down the
stairs.

722
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:51,714
This one is modelled
after Chuck E. Cheese,

723
00:35:51,758 --> 00:35:53,368
but I call it Chick E. Cheese.

724
00:35:53,412 --> 00:35:55,196
And there's a little bosspit.

725
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,155
And there's a fake band and then
this one is a honeymoon suite,

726
00:35:57,198 --> 00:36:01,202
it's got a, um, a heart-shaped
bed for getting it on.

727
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:05,598
Oh, look.
Claire, I almost forgot.

728
00:36:05,641 --> 00:36:08,253
This one's for you.

729
00:36:08,296 --> 00:36:10,994
It's an exact replica scale

730
00:36:11,038 --> 00:36:13,171
of the Full Houseliving room,
season one.

731
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:16,565
Paul, this is, this is amazing!

732
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:18,045
You don't have to say that.

733
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:21,570
No, Paul. No.
I-I'm really proud of you.

734
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,747
-Mm.
-Thank you.

735
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:28,229
-Tell me about your day!
-Oh--

736
00:36:28,273 --> 00:36:30,144
I can't believe.
I've been so focused on, I...

737
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,624
What about your day?
Take the mic.

738
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:33,756
-Okay.
-[laughs]

739
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,758
-[clicking] Is it on? Okay.
-[laughs] You...

740
00:36:35,802 --> 00:36:37,456
Um, so, yeah, we had this,
the surprise visit

741
00:36:37,499 --> 00:36:39,849
from a client at work and
everyone was, like, stressed out

742
00:36:39,893 --> 00:36:42,504
and losing their minds, but I
kept my cool and I saved the day

743
00:36:42,548 --> 00:36:44,506
with a stunning pitch
when everyone else had nothing.

744
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,247
-And Pearl even shook my hand.
-That hand?

745
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:47,248
-Yeah!
-All right! [laughs]

746
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:48,771
I knew you could do it!

747
00:36:48,815 --> 00:36:50,556
You know, and I-I just applied
the teachings

748
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:52,166
of Storsh
and it actually worked.

749
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,473
-Oh, my God. I love Storsh.
-Yeah, I know. Me, too.

750
00:36:54,516 --> 00:36:56,779
I'm so jacked up right now,
I can sell anything.

751
00:36:56,823 --> 00:36:59,217
-Well, sell me a birdhouse.
-How about a pun?

752
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,958
Like, uh, Paul's birdhouse,
when nature Pauls.

753
00:37:02,002 --> 00:37:03,308
-That's brilliant!
-[laughs]

754
00:37:03,351 --> 00:37:04,918
Okay, here's another...
Uh, uh...

755
00:37:04,961 --> 00:37:07,703
This birdhouse
will never Paul out of a tree.

756
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:09,444
You gotta slow down. I gotta
write this down. Seriously. I--

757
00:37:09,488 --> 00:37:11,403
Oh, no, no. Don't even sweat it.
I got a million of 'em.

758
00:37:11,446 --> 00:37:13,492
Okay, how about this one?
Uh, uh, Paul's Boyd...

759
00:37:13,535 --> 00:37:15,581
Paul Boyd's birdie
birdhouse building.

760
00:37:15,624 --> 00:37:17,757
-Ah! You know what your name is?
-What?

761
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,193
-Little Ms. Ideas. Yes.
-No.

762
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,281
-You're amazing.
-No, you're amazing.

763
00:37:20,325 --> 00:37:21,500
-We're amazing.
-Yeah.

764
00:37:21,543 --> 00:37:22,936
You know what this means,
Claire?

765
00:37:22,979 --> 00:37:24,764
We're finally
getting our stuff sorted.

766
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:25,982
Yeah.

767
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,029
[moaning]

768
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,604
[rattling]

769
00:37:42,216 --> 00:37:44,305
It was the '90s,

770
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:47,526
a different time,
a simpler time.

771
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:50,964
When a man committed a crime,
you kicked in the door

772
00:37:51,007 --> 00:37:53,532
and worried about paperwork
later.

773
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:57,405
But like all good times,

774
00:37:57,449 --> 00:37:59,625
that time was a time

775
00:37:59,668 --> 00:38:02,497
whose time has come to an end.

776
00:38:04,847 --> 00:38:08,068
[Cartwright] Then on April 2nd,
1997,

777
00:38:08,111 --> 00:38:11,767
I came face-to-face
with pure evil.

778
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:13,378
Reginald Euclid Storsh,

779
00:38:13,421 --> 00:38:15,728
incited over
two dozen innocent victims

780
00:38:15,771 --> 00:38:17,425
to self-murder.

781
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:20,341
An adversary so brilliant,
so cunning

782
00:38:20,385 --> 00:38:22,038
that to merely be
in his presence

783
00:38:22,082 --> 00:38:23,692
was to risk total mental

784
00:38:23,736 --> 00:38:26,347
and spiritual annihilation.

785
00:38:26,391 --> 00:38:29,263
"Detective Cartwright,
did you have a warrant

786
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,004
for these proceedings?"

787
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:34,442
"A warrant? Hell, no,
Your Honor, he's guilty."

788
00:38:34,486 --> 00:38:37,402
"Well, I don't care
how ridiculous or stupid

789
00:38:37,445 --> 00:38:40,318
or unfair it is,
I declare a mistrial.

790
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:42,145
Case dismissed."

791
00:38:42,189 --> 00:38:44,539
"Your Honor, no!"

792
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:46,889
So I made my life's goal up

793
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:49,544
to not give him
a moment's rest.

794
00:38:49,588 --> 00:38:51,720
I dogged him like a dog.

795
00:38:51,764 --> 00:38:54,854
But six months into it,
he committed suicide

796
00:38:54,897 --> 00:38:56,508
in a bath tub.

797
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:58,945
Then his followers started
committing suicide

798
00:38:58,988 --> 00:39:00,076
in the same tub.

799
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,122
Cultist after cultist

800
00:39:02,165 --> 00:39:04,385
dove into a porcelain nightmare

801
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:06,779
of blood and death.

802
00:39:06,822 --> 00:39:09,347
The chief
still has the case open.

803
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,000
And guess who has to clean up

804
00:39:11,044 --> 00:39:13,133
every time one of these morons

805
00:39:13,176 --> 00:39:15,744
commits a see-pa-coo
in the tub?

806
00:39:15,788 --> 00:39:18,704
That's right. Me. Cartwright.

807
00:39:18,747 --> 00:39:20,749
The last good cop.

808
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,068
[window opens]

809
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:38,854
Go, go, go, go, go, go.
Go, go, go.

810
00:39:38,898 --> 00:39:41,770
[instrumental music]

811
00:39:47,472 --> 00:39:48,603
[sighs]

812
00:39:57,612 --> 00:39:59,832
-Hey.
-Mm!

813
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:02,835
Oh... Oh, come on, man!

814
00:40:02,878 --> 00:40:05,315
-What?
-I booked the tub!

815
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,579
It's been on the schedule
for months.

816
00:40:07,622 --> 00:40:10,277
Okay. Just do it.

817
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,672
Three-way challenge.
Do you yield?

818
00:40:13,715 --> 00:40:15,674
I-I, I don't, I don't know.
Do we?

819
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:20,635
The invocation.

820
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:22,463
"In order to get
to instantaneous eternity,

821
00:40:22,507 --> 00:40:23,899
you must pass through
the gateway

822
00:40:23,943 --> 00:40:25,771
chosen by the Holy Storsh."

823
00:40:29,949 --> 00:40:34,040
What? Oh, my God!
You're initiates, aren't you?

824
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,955
Uh, initiates. Yeah.

825
00:40:35,998 --> 00:40:38,392
Actually, do you, do you
think you could teach us

826
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,612
some initiate stuff?

827
00:40:43,832 --> 00:40:47,009
Well, maybe I'll break the rules
this one time.

828
00:40:47,053 --> 00:40:48,663
[laughing]

829
00:40:48,707 --> 00:40:50,404
-[Claire] Awesome.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

830
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:54,321
All right, um, you know,
you two guys really lucked out.

831
00:40:54,364 --> 00:40:57,672
It's not every day
that two initiates

832
00:40:57,716 --> 00:41:00,240
get taught their invocation

833
00:41:00,283 --> 00:41:02,416
by a level-six instructor.

834
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,678
-Level six?
-Yeah.

835
00:41:03,722 --> 00:41:05,071
Is that, uh,
is that a good level?

836
00:41:05,114 --> 00:41:06,812
Uh, there's only 11 levels

837
00:41:06,855 --> 00:41:09,858
and I'm level six,
which is basically level seven,

838
00:41:09,902 --> 00:41:11,425
so really I'm an eight.

839
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,559
So, yeah,
I'd say it's pretty damn good.

840
00:41:14,602 --> 00:41:17,605
And I specialize
in invocation training.

841
00:41:17,649 --> 00:41:20,086
You could say
I'm kind of a big deal

842
00:41:20,129 --> 00:41:21,827
down at East Side Bethel,
you know?

843
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:23,306
-Huh. Mm!
-[Cultist] Okay.

844
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,265
-Uh, so lie down.
-All right.

845
00:41:25,308 --> 00:41:26,919
Here.

846
00:41:26,962 --> 00:41:29,704
Okay. Like the...

847
00:41:29,748 --> 00:41:34,448
Uh, okay, um, scooch down
towards me a little.

848
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,755
Okay, now go left, uh,
just a little bit.

849
00:41:36,798 --> 00:41:38,757
Okay. Actually, scooch back up
just a couple of...

850
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,020
Yeah, okay, that's good.
And come over to your right.

851
00:41:41,063 --> 00:41:42,412
Okay, you're moving faster,
so, so just...

852
00:41:42,456 --> 00:41:43,413
-Yeah. And then...
-Me? Oh. Okay.

853
00:41:43,457 --> 00:41:45,111
You come down just a touch.

854
00:41:45,154 --> 00:41:46,155
Perfect.

855
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:51,073
Actually, you know what?
Go, go back a little bit.

856
00:41:51,117 --> 00:41:55,208
That's it. That's it! Nice.

857
00:41:55,251 --> 00:41:57,471
This guy is awesome. I mean,
he's basically a level eight.

-[Claire] I know.
-[Paul chuckles]

859
00:42:02,911 --> 00:42:04,783
Okay.

860
00:42:04,826 --> 00:42:08,003
Now look up to the light.

861
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:12,181
That's life.

862
00:42:12,225 --> 00:42:15,881
It's bright, it's inviting,
it's warm.

863
00:42:15,924 --> 00:42:18,361
That's light. That's life.

864
00:42:18,405 --> 00:42:21,103
And this is death.

865
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,587
What do you see?

866
00:42:28,067 --> 00:42:31,070
[Paul] I-I can still see
an outline.

867
00:42:31,113 --> 00:42:32,854
[Claire] But it's fading.

868
00:42:32,898 --> 00:42:34,247
[Cultist] Exactly.

869
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:37,380
See, normally when someone dies,

870
00:42:37,424 --> 00:42:40,775
there's a little bit
of afterglow that lingers.

871
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:43,430
But then unfortunately,
it just disperses

872
00:42:43,473 --> 00:42:45,171
into the ether.

873
00:42:45,214 --> 00:42:49,088
But thanks to the great Storsh,

874
00:42:49,131 --> 00:42:52,787
his chosen will bask
in the light of eternity.

875
00:42:52,831 --> 00:42:55,573
Just because the magical Storsh

876
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:58,750
spilled his magical blood
in that bath tub,

877
00:42:58,793 --> 00:43:00,708
the bath tub is magical

878
00:43:00,752 --> 00:43:03,624
and will magically hold on
to the afterglow

879
00:43:03,668 --> 00:43:06,279
for all eternity.

880
00:43:06,322 --> 00:43:08,542
All of that in a bath tub?

to my exodus?

I would get emotional.

You know, you two
are gonna be great followers.

888
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:02,030
[Claire] Hm.

889
00:44:02,074 --> 00:44:03,641
I'm gonna tell Storsh about you

890
00:44:03,684 --> 00:44:06,121
when I get to the other side.

891
00:44:06,165 --> 00:44:08,080
-That's neat.

892
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:11,997

Bye.

It's just a sec.

895
00:44:33,409 --> 00:44:34,541

this actually hurts quite a bit.

-Ah! Oh, God!

Uh, no, I-I don't think so.

pick a title yet, but...

Well, what exactly
do you want me to do with this?

Well, do what you do.
Talk to people.

You must know actors, right?
D-do you know Wesley Snipes?

You know, I'll make some calls.

[mellow music]

973
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,538
[Claire] You know,
I've been thinking.

974
00:48:09,582 --> 00:48:12,411
When those guys first showed up
and were gonna kill themselves

975
00:48:12,454 --> 00:48:15,240
in our bath tub, I was like,
"Okay, t-this is crazy."

976
00:48:15,283 --> 00:48:17,503
And then when, you know, the
more we learned about Storsh,

977
00:48:17,546 --> 00:48:19,374
I can see
why these people follow him.

978
00:48:19,418 --> 00:48:21,072
You know, I mean, sure,
it's not for everybody,

979
00:48:21,115 --> 00:48:22,943
but think about what good
he's done for us

980
00:48:22,987 --> 00:48:24,423
and we're not even in his cult.

981
00:48:24,466 --> 00:48:26,425
Well, w-we can't be in a cult.
We're from Ohio.

982
00:48:26,468 --> 00:48:27,992
Yeah, but, you know,
when you think about it,

983
00:48:28,035 --> 00:48:29,732
all religions have good and bad.

984
00:48:29,776 --> 00:48:32,387
So, like, maybe we can just
take the good from Storsh

985
00:48:32,431 --> 00:48:34,172
and, like, apply it
to our own lives.

986
00:48:34,215 --> 00:48:36,000
Like, you know, the other day
when you burned your finger

987
00:48:36,043 --> 00:48:37,827
on the glue gun, and you're
like, "Oh, Jesus H. Christ,"

988
00:48:37,871 --> 00:48:39,220
but, like,
you're not even a Christian.

989
00:48:39,264 --> 00:48:41,353
No, you listen,
I'm totally good with having

990
00:48:41,396 --> 00:48:42,920
a little Storsh in our lives,
I mean, it means

991
00:48:42,963 --> 00:48:44,922
a little more blood
and violence, no biggie.

992
00:48:44,965 --> 00:48:46,749
But that's my point,
you know, these poor souls

993
00:48:46,793 --> 00:48:48,795
work so hard to meet Storsh
in the instantaneous eternity,

994
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:51,015
but they really have trouble
with the-the, like,

995
00:48:51,058 --> 00:48:52,103
the final commitment, you know?

996
00:48:52,146 --> 00:48:53,147

with helping our visitors
with a quick, clean transition

1003

is a bloom operator

1082

that that technically
makes it sci-fi,

1083
00:52:31,974 --> 00:52:33,933

wasn't that different from you

that as a woman,

And, yes,
it will be painful at first,

but eventually
you're gonna thank me.

going to enjoy liberating you

00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:35,016
Well, how was I supposed
to know that?

1197
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:37,541
It's called logic, Paul!

1198
00:57:37,584 --> 00:57:39,456
-Oh, shoot!
-My God!

1199
00:57:39,499 --> 00:57:42,154
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1200
00:57:42,197 --> 00:57:44,199
You let her paint
the country house?

1201
00:57:44,243 --> 00:57:46,680
I'd hardly call that
a country house.

1202
00:57:46,724 --> 00:57:48,290
[scoffs] No, no, no, no, no.

1203
00:57:48,334 --> 00:57:49,683
Country house, Boyd house,

1204
00:57:49,727 --> 00:57:51,250
complete with a little
front-porch swing

1205
00:57:51,293 --> 00:57:53,382
and a bird-watching tower
for watching birds.

1206
00:57:53,426 --> 00:57:55,733
Looks more like a fire station.

1207
00:57:55,776 --> 00:57:57,952
What kind of fire station
has a porch swing?

1208
00:57:57,996 --> 00:57:59,867
Forget about the birdhouse,
Paul.

1209
00:57:59,911 --> 00:58:01,913
We gotta deal with this now,
okay?

1210
00:58:01,956 --> 00:58:03,871
No, no, no. She's-she's...
It's gonna be fine.

1211
00:58:03,915 --> 00:58:06,265
I mean, she's still alive.
Everything's, everything's okay.

1212
00:58:06,308 --> 00:58:07,875
She's gonna tell everyone
what you did

1213
00:58:07,919 --> 00:58:09,007
and you're gonna go to jail!

1214
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:10,965
How can you be so stupid?

1215
00:58:14,621 --> 00:58:15,579
Paul!

1216
00:58:21,585 --> 00:58:23,500
I'm sorry, Ms. Nordheim.

1217
00:58:23,543 --> 00:58:25,806
Not the fire station.

1218
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:27,982
It's a country house.

1219
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:46,305
Cartwright's on his way.

1220
00:58:48,089 --> 00:58:50,570
What are you gonna tell him?

1221
00:58:50,614 --> 00:58:51,963
A story.

1222
00:58:54,008 --> 00:58:55,662
A love story

1223
00:58:55,706 --> 00:58:57,969
about a woman who married a man

1224
00:58:58,012 --> 00:58:59,927
for all of the right reasons,

1225
00:58:59,971 --> 00:59:02,321
and not for his money
and-and not for his power,

1226
00:59:02,364 --> 00:59:05,759
but because she saw
who he really was.

1227
00:59:05,803 --> 00:59:07,761
A man who needed her

1228
00:59:07,805 --> 00:59:10,634
more than she needed him.

1229
00:59:10,677 --> 00:59:12,810
It started out
as a pure kind of love,

1230
00:59:12,853 --> 00:59:16,683
but it quickly became
something else.

1231
00:59:16,727 --> 00:59:20,644
An obligation,
not for her, but for him.

1232
00:59:22,341 --> 00:59:25,736
For her it was never
a romantic kind of love.

1233
00:59:25,779 --> 00:59:28,565
It was a friend kind of love.

1234
00:59:28,608 --> 00:59:31,219
She knew that if she left him,

1235
00:59:31,263 --> 00:59:33,613
it would destroy him.

1236
00:59:33,657 --> 00:59:37,617
So she stayed by his side
and hoped that he would realize

1237
00:59:37,661 --> 00:59:40,228
that he bet on the wrong horse.

1238
00:59:41,621 --> 00:59:43,362
But he never did.

1239
00:59:44,711 --> 00:59:47,845
So she was trapped...

1240
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,500
until she found Storsh.

1241
00:59:53,328 --> 00:59:55,417
What she never found
in her marriage,

1242
00:59:55,461 --> 00:59:58,899
she found in the open arms
of Storsh and his followers,

1243
00:59:58,943 --> 01:00:01,162
seekers
of the instantaneous eternity,

1244
01:00:01,206 --> 01:00:03,208
that one brief moment of bliss

1245
01:00:03,251 --> 01:00:05,906
that can go on for forever.

1246
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:08,692
Armund was so distraught,
so devastated

1247
01:00:08,735 --> 01:00:11,085
by the loss of his one true love

1248
01:00:11,129 --> 01:00:13,392
that he sought to follow her.

1249
01:00:13,435 --> 01:00:14,872
He'd rather die in her arms

1250
01:00:14,915 --> 01:00:17,265
than live without her
for one more day.

1251
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:21,574
Wow.

1252
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:23,358
Gosh, darn it, Claire.

1253
01:00:25,099 --> 01:00:27,449
I have to say something to you
right now.

1254

You-you know what?
We had a problem, right?

1255
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,021
And what do we do?

1256
01:00:34,065 --> 01:00:35,762
-We sorted it.
-Uh-huh.

1257
01:00:35,806 --> 01:00:38,765
This problem is sorted.
It's sorted.

1258

And it's not just this problem,
it's everything, our...

Anything, Claire, shoot.

We haven't had a cult member
in a while

is there some sort of, like,

that we're not aware of?

there was a dry spell

that a guy like me

1365
01:06:05,222 --> 01:06:07,050
As-as much as I don't wanna
admit it, like,

1366
01:06:07,093 --> 01:06:09,182
that's pretty much
a manlier occupation.

1367
01:06:09,226 --> 01:06:12,272
I mean, an the Irish already
fight everything.

1368
01:06:12,316 --> 01:06:14,100
This guy fights fire.

1369
01:06:14,144 --> 01:06:16,624
Uh, [chuckles], I-I-I just
thought, like,

1370
01:06:16,668 --> 01:06:18,670
kind of a,
like a triangle thing

1371
01:06:18,713 --> 01:06:21,673
with like
Matthew McConaughey, uh,

1372
01:06:21,716 --> 01:06:24,067
Kate Hudson and maybe
like Wesley Snipes.

1373
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:27,026
If he gets one on this one...

1374
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:29,028
[water gurgling]

1375
01:06:29,072 --> 01:06:30,987
[dramatic music]

1376
01:06:38,777 --> 01:06:41,171
Okay, so listen,
Nordheim wasn't in the cult.

1377
01:06:41,214 --> 01:06:42,868
-But we saved her anyway.
-Well, she needed to be saved.

1378
01:06:42,911 --> 01:06:44,783
-She wanted to kill puppies.
-Exactly.

1379
01:06:44,826 --> 01:06:46,393
So before we were saving people

1380
01:06:46,437 --> 01:06:48,308
into the instantaneous eternity
who wanted to be saved,

1381
01:06:48,352 --> 01:06:50,136
but maybe we save people
who need to be saved

1382
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:51,485
that don't even know
they need to be saved.

1383
01:06:51,529 --> 01:06:52,530
That's great, like murderers

1384
01:06:52,573 --> 01:06:54,227
and rapists or celebrity chefs.

1385
01:06:54,271 --> 01:06:57,013
Exactly. Okay. Let's do this.

1386
01:06:58,623 --> 01:07:00,538
[instrumental music]

1387
01:07:04,672 --> 01:07:05,630
[grunts]

1388
01:07:28,653 --> 01:07:30,568
[music continues]

1389
01:07:40,534 --> 01:07:44,060
It's a, um, new anti-depressant.

1390
01:07:44,103 --> 01:07:46,105
We have to sell people
on getting happy

1391
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:48,673
because apparantly
hopelessness and despair

1392
01:07:48,716 --> 01:07:50,979
are currently trending.

1393
01:07:51,023 --> 01:07:53,678
Mr. Carl, I've got this.

1394
01:07:58,770 --> 01:08:01,816
The only way to achieve
complete happiness is...

1395
01:08:03,601 --> 01:08:07,126
by inviting the father and
savior Storsh in to your heart.

1396
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:09,172
Now, I-I know, I know you're all
looking at me

1397
01:08:09,215 --> 01:08:11,609
like you're a little skeptical,
but believe me, I was too,

1398
01:08:11,652 --> 01:08:13,480
but, you know, you just,
you just gotta go for it.

1399
01:08:13,524 --> 01:08:15,613
So, I-I'd love
for you guys to join.

1400
01:08:15,656 --> 01:08:17,615
You know, just a bunch
of like-minded people

1401
01:08:17,658 --> 01:08:20,008
who wanna be as happy
as they can be. [laughs]

1402
01:08:21,706 --> 01:08:23,925
That's all very interesting.

1403
01:08:23,969 --> 01:08:26,406
And you've given us a lot
to think about.

1404
01:08:28,408 --> 01:08:30,628
[dramatic music]

1405
01:08:30,671 --> 01:08:33,152
Stupid legs, stupid legs.

1406
01:08:33,196 --> 01:08:34,849
Stupid rigor-mortis legs!

1407
01:08:34,893 --> 01:08:37,156
Oh! Fuck!

1408
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:40,246
Claire! Claire!
Thanks God you're home.

1409
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:43,206
Something terrible has happened.
They shut down my website.

1410
01:08:43,249 --> 01:08:44,555
And my credit card was declined.

1411
01:08:44,598 --> 01:08:47,079
I was just so busy
making birdhouses

1412
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:49,908
that I forgot to pay
and then the bank was so far

1413
01:08:49,951 --> 01:08:52,171
that I didn't wanna walk
and I spent all my money

1414
01:08:52,215 --> 01:08:53,999
on skittles and wood
and thanks God...

1415
01:08:54,042 --> 01:08:56,741
Thanks God for you, Claire,
thanks God for you.

1416
01:08:56,784 --> 01:08:58,525
Can you swap me 200 bucks?

1417
01:08:58,569 --> 01:09:01,528
They fired me, Paul!
They fired me!

1418
01:09:01,572 --> 01:09:03,182
-We don't have jobs.
-[groaning]

1419
01:09:03,226 --> 01:09:06,316
We are unsorted, Paul!
We're unsorted!

1420
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:09,319
[Paul groaning]

1421
01:09:09,362 --> 01:09:12,322
What are we gonna do, Claire?
What are we gonna do?

1422
01:09:12,365 --> 01:09:14,715
I love you. I love you. Uh...

1423
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:16,717
Yeah?

1424
01:09:19,416 --> 01:09:21,331
[instrumental music]

1425
01:09:30,905 --> 01:09:32,820
[Claire screaming]

1426
01:09:41,002 --> 01:09:42,917
[Claire grunting]

1427
01:09:48,749 --> 01:09:50,490
[birds chirping]

1428
01:10:03,111 --> 01:10:05,026
[eerie music]

1429
01:10:27,788 --> 01:10:29,703
[bells chiming]

1430
01:10:55,816 --> 01:11:00,343
[Paul] Claire Annabelle McKenty,
you, will you marry me?

1431
01:11:12,398 --> 01:11:15,009
[sobbing] No.

1432
01:11:15,053 --> 01:11:16,968
I can't marry you.

1433
01:11:35,639 --> 01:11:37,554
[operatic singing]

1434
01:11:53,439 --> 01:11:55,572
Hello, Claire, my child.

1435
01:11:57,878 --> 01:12:01,360
-It's you.
-It's me.

1436
01:12:01,404 --> 01:12:03,014
I-I can't believe it.
You-you came.

1437
01:12:03,057 --> 01:12:04,276
They doubted you, but you came.

1438
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,540
Shh, quiet now.
Let's not spoil it.

1439
01:12:07,584 --> 01:12:09,194
I just can't believe it.

1440
01:12:09,237 --> 01:12:11,109
You're actually,
you're here i-in my tub.

1441
01:12:11,152 --> 01:12:12,545
[Storsh] Remember the thing
about not spoiling it

1442
01:12:12,589 --> 01:12:14,155
that I just said
six seconds ago?

1443
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:16,941
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sorry.
I just...

1444
01:12:16,984 --> 01:12:19,509
Well, y-your teachings
have changed my life.

1445
01:12:19,552 --> 01:12:21,511
-Mm-hmm.
-It's just...

1446
01:12:21,554 --> 01:12:23,295
Things aren't working now
and I don't know,

1447
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,341
I don't know
where I've gone wrong.

1448
01:12:25,384 --> 01:12:27,386
Mm, tell you,
when this whole thing started,

1449
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:30,389
I never thought it would spread
further than my backyard.

1450
01:12:30,433 --> 01:12:32,304
Just a bunch of crazy loons
dancing in the light

1451
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:36,003
of the instantaneous eternity
over nachos and Fanta.

1452
01:12:36,047 --> 01:12:39,355
But soon the whole city
became my backyard.

1453
01:12:39,398 --> 01:12:42,619
The beacon of Storsh was lit
and the people came.

1454
01:12:44,055 --> 01:12:45,491
I know I did.

1455
01:12:45,535 --> 01:12:47,101
I know you know you did.

1456
01:12:47,145 --> 01:12:49,539
I was watching you
from the afterlife.

1457
01:12:49,582 --> 01:12:53,107
You know, the spiritual reward
for saving souls was incredible.

1458
01:12:53,151 --> 01:12:54,979
What a buzz!
It's just like a tingle.

1459
01:12:55,022 --> 01:12:56,981
But soon that wasn't enough.

1460
01:12:57,024 --> 01:12:58,722
I needed to reach
more of my children,

1461
01:12:58,765 --> 01:13:00,506
I needed the message
to find the masses

1462
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:02,769
and save the souls
of the entire world

1463
01:13:02,813 --> 01:13:05,119
like, on a God level.

1464
01:13:05,163 --> 01:13:09,472
You know, I, I made a plan
and that plan was I'd get caught

1465
01:13:09,515 --> 01:13:11,648
and I'd become
a media sensation.

1466
01:13:11,691 --> 01:13:14,128
Live out my days in some
cushy, white-collared prison

1467
01:13:14,172 --> 01:13:15,739
like Bundy Romanson.

1468
01:13:15,782 --> 01:13:19,133
TV specials, conjugal visits.

1469
01:13:19,177 --> 01:13:21,440
So I let that cop catch me.

1470
01:13:21,484 --> 01:13:24,269
You know this guy,
you know who I'm talking about?

1471
01:13:24,312 --> 01:13:25,923
-Cartwright?
-Yeah.

1472
01:13:25,966 --> 01:13:28,055
Naturally, he screwed it all up
and I got off.

1473
01:13:28,099 --> 01:13:29,753
But it turns out,
getting away with it

1474
01:13:29,796 --> 01:13:32,190
was like some major power move.

1475
01:13:32,233 --> 01:13:33,670
Next thing,
I'm this huge celebrity,

1476
01:13:33,713 --> 01:13:34,932
people following me around,

1477
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:36,324
"Oh, Storsh, have my baby.

1478
01:13:36,368 --> 01:13:37,891
Storsh, can I get a photo?

1479
01:13:37,935 --> 01:13:40,067
Storsh, can I get a photo
of you and me

1480
01:13:40,111 --> 01:13:41,373
trying to make babies?"

1481
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,027
People offering me book deals,

1482
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:45,421
multiple book deals,
like a three-book deal.

1483
01:13:45,464 --> 01:13:49,120
In the grocery store,
people offering me cupcakes,

1484
01:13:49,163 --> 01:13:50,861
people... I mean, you name it.

1485
01:13:50,904 --> 01:13:53,298
I had an assistant...

1486
01:13:53,341 --> 01:13:55,431
for a little while.

1487
01:13:55,474 --> 01:13:57,433
But then I realized,
"Oh, my God.

1488
01:13:57,476 --> 01:13:59,391
I could immortalize myself

1489
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,045
and forever spread
the word of Storsh

1490
01:14:01,088 --> 01:14:04,483
with the ultimate saving.
Who? Me, myself."

1491
01:14:04,527 --> 01:14:06,964
So I climbed in this bathtub
here and I did my thing

1492
01:14:07,007 --> 01:14:10,663
and in one fell swoop, I became
the god I was destined to be.

1493
01:14:12,099 --> 01:14:15,494
Oh, that is so beautiful.

1494
01:14:15,538 --> 01:14:18,323
Yeah, I guess it is.

1495
01:14:18,366 --> 01:14:21,282
But, you, Claire, you, my love.

1496
01:14:21,326 --> 01:14:23,154
None of my followers
have served me

1497
01:14:23,197 --> 01:14:25,417
as greatly or lovingly as you.

1498
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:28,420
And yet, there is still one
final lesson for you to learn.

1499
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,988
Oh, teach me. I-I want to learn.

1500
01:14:32,555 --> 01:14:35,514
You've been so focused
on saving everyone else,

1501
01:14:35,558 --> 01:14:39,387
[mumbles] you've forgotten the
most important person of all.

1502
01:14:39,431 --> 01:14:42,086
I-I'm sorry, what?

1503
01:14:42,129 --> 01:14:44,915
You've been so focused
on saving everyone else,

1504
01:14:44,958 --> 01:14:48,527
[mumbles] you've forgotten the
most important person of all.

1505
01:14:48,571 --> 01:14:49,746
I-I don't--

1506
01:14:49,789 --> 01:14:50,790
You've forgotten
the most important

1507
01:14:50,834 --> 01:14:52,183
person of all.

1508
01:14:53,576 --> 01:14:56,927
Oh... Oh.

1509
01:14:56,970 --> 01:15:01,235
Yeah. I understand.

1510
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:03,934
I understand.

1511
01:15:06,545 --> 01:15:09,287
The door to my bus
is always open, Claire.

1512
01:15:10,593 --> 01:15:11,942
Always open.

1513
01:15:14,553 --> 01:15:16,468
[dramatic music]

1514
01:15:25,172 --> 01:15:27,087
[music intensifies]

1515
01:15:43,016 --> 01:15:44,931
[humming]

1516
01:15:50,328 --> 01:15:51,982
Hey, Cartwright.

1517
01:15:52,025 --> 01:15:56,116
I heard you're, uh, going off
to make your movie.

1518
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,902
Yeah.
Finally pulling it together.

1519
01:15:58,945 --> 01:16:00,599
-Oh.
-[Cartwright chuckling]

1520
01:16:00,643 --> 01:16:02,035
I'll see you at the premiere.

1521
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:03,994
[laughing]

1522
01:16:07,737 --> 01:16:09,042
Oh-ho...

1523
01:16:11,654 --> 01:16:14,047
Ah, man, you're such a wiener.

1524
01:16:14,091 --> 01:16:15,832
[laughing]

1525
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:19,618
Oh, man. [laughing]

1526
01:16:31,761 --> 01:16:33,110
Hey.

1527
01:16:33,153 --> 01:16:34,111
Hey.

1528
01:16:37,375 --> 01:16:39,116
Still wanna go to Winnipeg?

1529
01:16:39,159 --> 01:16:41,727
[chuckles] Not really.

1530
01:16:41,771 --> 01:16:43,337
Yeah, me neither.

1531
01:16:46,993 --> 01:16:48,691
And while you were in there
talking to the bathtub,

1532
01:16:48,734 --> 01:16:51,476
I did some thinking.

1533
