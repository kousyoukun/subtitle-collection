1
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:51,074
Happy Thanksgiving!

2
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:54,936
Come here!

3
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,676
Yeah!
Right here!

4
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,447
Toss me a bird, Bumpy!

5
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:02,987
Bumpy!

6
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,255
Yeah!
Bumpy! We love you!

7
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:07,950
There you go, darling.

8
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,359
Over here! Over here!

9
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:16,765
Frank! Come on!

10
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,429
Come here.

11
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:35,416
This is the problem. This
is what's wrong with America.

12
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:39,747
It's gotten so big,
you just can't find your way.

13
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,653
The grocery store on the
corner is now a supermarket.

14
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:48,094
The candy store
is a McDonald's.

15
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:53,132
And this place, a
super-fucking discount store.

16
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,441
Where's the pride
of ownership, huh?

17
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,641
Where's the personal service?

18
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:09,448
You see what I mean? Shit.

19
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,951
I mean, what right do they have,
of cutting out the suppliers,

20
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,492
pushing out all the middlemen,

21
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:23,625
buying direct
from the manufacturer?

22
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:28,438
Sony this, Toshiba that.

23
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:32,477
All them Chinks putting
Americans out of work.

24
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,279
That's the way it is now.

25
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:46,718
You all right?

26
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,622
You can't find
the heart of anything

27
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:53,465
to stick the knife.

28
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:56,960
Hey!

29
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,333
Anybody here?

30
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:00,962
Can I help you?

31
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,439
Call an ambulance.

32
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,271
Forget it, Frank.

33
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,042
There's no one in charge.

34
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,680
Call an ambulance!

35
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,322
Some say
Bumpy Johnson was a great man,

36
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,517
according to the eulogies,
a giving man,

37
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,786
a man of the people.

38
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,555
No one chose to use
in their remembrances

39
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,630
the word most often
associated with

40
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,791
Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson,
"gangster,"

41
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,495
whose passing has brought a who's who
of mourners on this chilly afternoon.

42
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,038
Lucchese mob boss
Dominic Cattano,

43
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,834
Harlem crime figure
Nicky Barnes.

44
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,000
Nicky! Nicky!

45
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,236
From the
political arena,

46
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,744
<i>the Governor has come down,
the Mayor of New York,</i>

47
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,214
<i>and Chief of Police and Commissioner,
sports and entertainment luminaries.</i>

48
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,520
<i>Bumpy Johnson,
age 62 when he passed,</i>

49
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,148
<i>was a folk hero among Harlem
locals for over four decades.</i>

50
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:54,624
<i>Regarded by some
as the Robin Hood of Harlem,</i>

51
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,592
<i>by others as
a ruthless criminal...</i>

52
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,424
I don't understand,
you know.

53
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:02,762
I would've thought that Bumpy would
put out a better spread, you know?

54
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,733
You want something?
No, thanks.

55
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,495
I want chicken wings
at my funeral.

56
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,097
All right, Nicky Barnes.
Who is that?

57
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:10,937
He didn't know what hit him,
you know what I'm saying?

58
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,375
I just kept popping him in the
face 'cause that's what I do.

59
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,109
Mmm.

60
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,887
I don't have a lighter.
You have a light?

61
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:26,248
Oh.

62
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,055
Okay?

63
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,128
That's very good.

64
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,966
Hey, Frank.

65
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:43,070
Go get me a light
while you're at it.

66
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,104
Appreciate it.

67
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,310
Don Cattano.

68
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,507
Hey, how you doing, Rossi?

69
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:51,913
Good.

70
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,383
Would you
like a drink, sir?

71
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:56,250
Give him a scotch
on the rocks.

72
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,219
Come on. Come on.

73
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,463
I know you're hurting, Frank.

74
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:16,433
So am I.

75
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,102
I'm all right.

76
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,737
You gonna be all right?
Yeah.

77
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,481
I'm sure Bumpy didn't say anything
to you, but he made me promise

78
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,846
that if anything
ever happened to him,

79
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,977
that I should make sure
that you want for nothing.

80
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,083
I appreciate that.

81
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,422
You know, half the people in this
room owed Bumpy money when he died.

82
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,657
They think I'm gonna forget to
collect, but I'm gonna get that money.

83
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,859
Well, that's the spirit.
Go get 'em.

84
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,905
Mr. Roberts,
taking the prosecution's side,

85
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,805
Mr. Roberts,
taking the prosecution's side,

86
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:54,072
<i>give us US v. Mead, subject,
issues, what the determination was</i>

87
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:56,681
and what it means to us today.

88
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:01,644
Class, you'll be critiquing
Mr. Roberts, so pay attention.

89
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,083
<i>I hate hearing
my name called, you know?</i>

90
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:09,127
It means I gotta get up in front
of the class, I gotta turn around,

91
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:13,324
and I know every one of those people
there, they know more than I do.

92
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:17,425
The number one fear of people, it
ain't dying, it's public speaking.

93
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:18,936
I get physically ill,
I wanna throw up.

94
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,835
And that's what you
wanna do for a living.

95
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,100
No, I don't wanna be like
that, man, I wanna beat it.

96
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,267
So, should I do this?

97
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,777
No, he'll take it from me, he knows
me. I've known him since high school.

98
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,313
From high school?
Good morning. Yeah.

99
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,508
He doesn't take it, just
throw it in. It's good service.

100
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,119
Throw it in? All right.
Yeah.

101
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:37,019
What's up, Susie?
Hey, Jay.

102
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,023
How you doing, baby?
All right.

103
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:40,489
All right. Ready?

104
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,169
Hey! That's his head!

105
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:10,784
You're supposed
to be my friend, asshole!

106
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:14,284
CAMPIZl: I swear to God,
Richie, I didn't know it was you.

107
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,487
I would never slam a door
on your hand, knowingly.

108
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:18,757
You bit my fucking hand.

109
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,560
What are you doing
serving subpoenas, anyway?

110
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,668
We're on loan to County.
County?

111
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,827
How's that working out
for you? Hey, fuck you.

112
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:29,033
Hey, I'm sorry. Consider me
served. Can we leave it there?

113
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,042
Assault on a police officer?
I don't think so.

114
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,408
Hey, for old times' sake.
What can we do?

115
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,879
What do you want?
What can I give you?

116
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,245
What do you get for assault
with a deadly weapon, Jay?

117
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,248
Five years minimum.
Five years.

118
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:44,516
Guys, come on. No, guys. What
do you want? Who do you want?

119
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,085
Who do you got?

120
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:50,821
You want Big Al's bookie? You want
his accountant? I'll give him to you.

121
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,434
CAMPIZl: Stop, stop, stop.

122
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,700
There he is.

123
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,373
That's him.
That's the bookie.

124
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,210
All right,
Carlo, get lost.

125
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,908
Get out of the car.

126
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,851
CAMPIZl: This is... I'd
rather not. Come on. Let's go.

127
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,684
Take it ease.

128
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,301
Want to stay with him
or the car?

129
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,913
Let's see who comes
for the car.

130
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,123
Think he made us?

131
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,930
You called in the warrants,
right? So, where are they?

132
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,623
I just called, man.

133
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:06,568
I called and walked back here
and 10 seconds has gone by.

134
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,906
I saw him with the slips, Jay.

135
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,673
You saw policy slips? You saw grocery
bags. You don't know what's in 'em.

136
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,180
Yes, I do and so do you.
Don't give me that bull.

137
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:20,285
What's the rush, Richie? Half an
hour, the warrant will be here.

138
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:24,322
I got night school, all right?
Guess you're gonna miss it.

139
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,594
Fuck this. Come on.
You sure?

140
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,564
Yeah, I'm sure. Let's go.

141
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,052
Fuck.

142
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,189
Jay.
Yeah?

143
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:40,862
Fuck.

144
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,502
<i>WBZ, honey bunch,
the show they all love!</i>

145
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:49,904
<i>It's the groovy sound of the
Jefferson Kaye Saturday Night Show.</i>

146
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,203
<i>Dig, honey, it's
coming up time for news.</i>

147
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,972
<i>Jumping on the ceiling,
wallpaper peeling on WBZ.</i>

148
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,345
<i>Stick around, the Jace-man's
got 10. Back in 10.</i>

149
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,648
It's not just a
couple of bucks, all right?

150
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,386
It's the same thing
in principle.

151
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:10,690
Oh, are we talking principles?

152
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:14,254
Richie, a cop who turns in this
kind of money, says one thing.

153
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:18,091
He turns in cops who take
money. We'll be fucking pariahs.

154
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,670
Yeah, well, then
we're fucked both ways.

155
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,536
Not if we keep it. Only if we don't,
then you're right, we're fucked.

156
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,541
But not if we keep it.

157
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,844
God damn it, man!
Did we ask for this?

158
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,916
Did we put a gun to someone's
head and say, "Give us your money"?

159
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,781
Cops kill cops
they can't trust.

160
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,415
We can't turn it in, man.

161
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,532
Can you believe that?

162
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,140
How much is it?

163
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,080
$987,000.

164
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,452
Well, what happened
to the rest of it?

165
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,083
What the hell
are you doing

166
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,386
counting it out here
in front of everybody?

167
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:15,482
Are you nuts?

168
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:21,299
Get it back in the bags, seal them
up and down into the property room.

169
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,568
You fucking Boy Scout.

170
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,797
What? What?

171
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,793
Detective Trupo, sign here.

172
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,766
You guys ready to make
a lot of fucking money?

173
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,065
Always.
Hell, yeah.

174
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,434
Fucking A.

175
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,103
Oh, look at this.

176
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,336
There you go.

177
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,845
All right, look at
this. Fucking beautiful.

178
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,813
There's three more boats.

179
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,519
Hey, don't lose
any of that shit.

180
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,958
I know.
All right, be careful.

181
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,462
Hey! Just enough for
the reagent test.

182
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,965
A little less.

183
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,977
<i>This is the
French Connection dope.</i>

184
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,379
<i>Kilos of the same dope Eddie Egan
and Sonny Grosso took from us.</i>

185
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,747
<i>The cops seize it,
arrest everyone,</i>

186
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,252
<i>then they start taking it out
of the evidence room,</i>

187
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:26,847
<i>whacking it down to nothing
and selling it back to us.</i>

188
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,359
<i>They basically control
the market with it.</i>

189
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,021
Mr. Rossi,
I have a surprise for you.

190
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,157
<i>They've been doing it for years
now. They live off it, our dope.</i>

191
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,256
What do you think?

192
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,267
What the fuck is happening
to the world, Frank?

193
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,364
Those fucking crooks.

194
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,832
Yeah. Sad about Bumpy.

195
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,575
Things are never gonna
be the same in Harlem.

196
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:52,707
You walk down the street, nobody bothers
you 'cause Bumpy was making sure of it.

197
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,351
Half a key.

198
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,514
How is your day now?

199
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,582
It's chaos.
Every gorilla for hisself.

200
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,922
Motherfucker!

201
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:10,360
Who can live like that?
There has to be order.

202
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,604
That would never
happen with Italians.

203
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:16,435
More important than any
one man's life, is order.

204
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,810
Frank.

205
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:29,414
Hey. Come on in,
Claude. Sit down.

206
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,488
How y'all doing, huh?
Good.

207
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,027
So, you see Nate over there?
Yeah?

208
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,427
Yeah, all the time.

209
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,590
Nate is everywhere. He's good.
Yeah.

210
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,895
He's still over there? Yeah.
He's got himself a club now.

211
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,437
Okay. Whereabouts, Saigon?
Bangkok.

212
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,937
Bangkok? I don't think he's
ever coming home.

213
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:54,970
Come on.

214
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,271
On the house,
for our boys in uniform.

215
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,311
Thank you, sugar.
That's very kind.

216
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,174
Thank Frank.

217
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:30,781
Thanks, Frank.

218
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,778
Just relax.

219
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:38,254
You have to boot
this shit a couple of times.

220
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,991
The cops keep cutting it,
selling the shit.

221
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,198
I don't want to say anything,
'cause the price is right,

222
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:50,495
but that shit in Nam is way,

223
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:55,299
way heavy.

224
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:22,292
Did you ain't seen
the jar, Frank, hmm?

225
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,528
I think you walked
right past it.

226
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:29,239
The money jar, Frank. What do I
gotta do, put a fucking sign on it?

227
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:30,363
Hmm?

228
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,839
Look at this nigger
right here. You know, Frank,

229
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,143
Bumpy don't own 116th no more.

230
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,146
Bumpy don't own no real
estate in Harlem right now.

231
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:43,050
I'm the landlord
and the lease is 20%.

232
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,888
Look, don't sell dope then,
Frank. Get a real job.

233
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:51,154
You need a fucking job, Frank?
Hmm? Is that what you need?

234
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,594
Well, you can
come work for me.

235
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:55,700
Okay? You can drive me around,
huh? You can open my doors.

236
00:18:55,801 --> 00:19:00,932
Huh? "Yes, sir", "No, sir", "Right away,
sir", "Anything you want, Massa Johnson".

237
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,732
Twenty percent.

238
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,513
Twenty percent
is my profit, Tango.

239
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,582
If I give you that, then what
do I got left? Nothing, man.

240
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,123
Twenty percent puts
me out of business,

241
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,090
and every somebody
you know out of business.

242
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,554
There's legitimate ways of doing
things, Tango, and then there's this way.

243
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,859
Not even Bumpy took 20%.

244
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,900
Bumpy's fucking dead.

245
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,635
My man.

246
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,404
Twenty percent?

247
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,017
Twenty percent.
Doc, let's go.

248
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,935
<i>Out. Good job. Sit.</i>

249
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:13,476
<i>A leader, like a shepherd,</i>

250
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:16,615
<i>he sends his fastest
nimble sheep, out front.</i>

251
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,546
And the others will follow.

252
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:22,087
While the shepherd,
he walks quietly behind it.

253
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:23,745
Here, boy!
Here we go. Right here.

254
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,346
Bring it here. Yeah.

255
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:30,524
Now he's got the stick,
and the cane, he'll use it!

256
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,992
If he has to.

257
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,430
But most times
he doesn't have to.

258
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:39,300
He moves the whole
herd quietly.

259
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:46,610
What right do they have
cutting out the supplier?

260
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:49,370
The middleman.
Buying direct.

261
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:54,047
Putting Americans
out of work.

262
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,017
That's the way
it is now, Frank.

263
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,390
That's the way it is.

264
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,873
<i>The drug problem in Vietnam
is more than marijuana.</i>

265
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,210
<i>At this point, it is
estimated that one third</i>

266
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:26,511
<i>of American troops
are experimenting</i>

267
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,449
<i>with opium and heroin.</i>

268
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,022
<i>The authorities say
they have confiscated</i>

269
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,650
<i>large quantities of marijuana,
heroin and pills.</i>

270
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:37,860
<i>Every person and every
vehicle going through the gates</i>

271
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,022
<i>is subject to
a thorough shakedown.</i>

272
00:21:42,683 --> 00:21:44,082
<i>Soldiers have access to the drugs
at many rest and relaxation spots</i>

273
00:21:44,218 --> 00:21:48,245
<i>in Bangkok, Saigon and other areas
throughout Vietnam and Thailand.</i>

274
00:21:48,389 --> 00:21:52,485
<i>Officials say the easy
availability, relatively cheap cost</i>

275
00:21:52,593 --> 00:21:56,256
<i>and high purity of heroin
throughout Saigon and the Far East,</i>

276
00:21:56,397 --> 00:22:00,834
<i>is leading to an epidemic of
heroin addiction among US soldiers.</i>

277
00:22:03,971 --> 00:22:06,064
<i>Operator.
Yeah, international.</i>

278
00:22:06,207 --> 00:22:08,437
<i>What city?
Bangkok.</i>

279
00:22:08,576 --> 00:22:11,340
<i>You know the country code?
Yeah, 376.</i>

280
00:22:11,612 --> 00:22:13,136
<i>For the first three minutes,
it'll be...</i>

281
00:22:13,247 --> 00:22:16,011
I got it, I got it. I got it.

282
00:22:20,788 --> 00:22:21,777
Hello?

283
00:22:21,922 --> 00:22:23,412
<i>Soul Brothers.
Hey, can I help you?</i>

284
00:22:23,557 --> 00:22:24,717
Nate.

285
00:22:25,126 --> 00:22:27,060
<i>Do I know you?
Yeah, it's me.</i>

286
00:22:27,161 --> 00:22:29,789
Your cousin, negro.

287
00:22:34,135 --> 00:22:35,762
Go on, get yourself
a new suit.

288
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,034
Look, I'm sorry.

289
00:23:14,141 --> 00:23:15,506
Oh, please, Richie.

290
00:23:16,043 --> 00:23:19,274
It couldn't be avoided. I'll
take him next weekend, all right?

291
00:23:19,814 --> 00:23:21,338
We're moving.

292
00:23:21,482 --> 00:23:23,450
What? Where?

293
00:23:24,952 --> 00:23:27,477
The St. Regis.
What do you care?

294
00:23:29,824 --> 00:23:31,291
To my sister's.

295
00:23:31,392 --> 00:23:33,690
Your sister's? In Vegas?
Yeah.

296
00:23:33,828 --> 00:23:36,490
You are not moving to Las
Vegas. Not with Michael, anyway.

297
00:23:37,832 --> 00:23:40,926
What am I supposed to do with him,
leave him with you? There's a picture.

298
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:44,000
Hey, guys! Be cool.

299
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:50,032
Laurie, Las Vegas is not the kind
of place that you raise a kid.

300
00:23:50,177 --> 00:23:53,340
Oh, like this is a good
environment? And around your friends?

301
00:23:53,481 --> 00:23:55,278
When am I supposed
to see my boy?

302
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:57,611
This weekend.
Last weekend.

303
00:23:59,086 --> 00:24:00,610
God damn it.

304
00:24:00,721 --> 00:24:03,349
Hey! I asked you nice
to shut up, right?

305
00:24:03,457 --> 00:24:04,617
Now I'm gonna
have to kill you.

306
00:24:04,725 --> 00:24:07,888
I swear I will pull out my gun and
put a bullet in your fucking heads!

307
00:24:08,062 --> 00:24:10,053
Now stop what you're doing
and pick up the glass!

308
00:24:10,197 --> 00:24:11,824
Calm down, man.
Okay, be cool.

309
00:24:15,236 --> 00:24:16,703
Fucking crazy, man.

310
00:24:18,172 --> 00:24:19,696
You don't have a gun.

311
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,972
You sure?

312
00:24:32,052 --> 00:24:33,883
You are crazy, Richie.

313
00:24:38,192 --> 00:24:40,353
You don't have room for us.

314
00:24:42,062 --> 00:24:43,893
I'll see you in court.

315
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:47,191
Come on, Michael.

316
00:24:47,568 --> 00:24:49,331
Say bye to your dad.

317
00:24:50,604 --> 00:24:52,799
Get over here.
Hey, kiddo.

318
00:24:54,108 --> 00:24:57,407
I'll see you next week,
all right? We'll do something.

319
00:24:58,345 --> 00:25:00,870
Let's get you
an ice cream.

320
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:29,107
You have 10 minutes
remaining. Ten minutes.

321
00:26:35,276 --> 00:26:38,302
Shake it, baby.
Shake it, shake it, shake it.

322
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,448
Oh, come on, girl. Don't tell me
$5 don't get me a little something.

323
00:26:45,552 --> 00:26:48,077
Can you dig that it
costs money to be here?

324
00:26:48,455 --> 00:26:49,820
Oh, come on, girl.

325
00:27:23,724 --> 00:27:25,783
How much you want, Frank?

326
00:27:26,527 --> 00:27:28,518
Tell him I want 100 keys.

327
00:27:30,664 --> 00:27:33,394
Frank, ain't nobody I know can get
you that much personally, all right?

328
00:27:33,534 --> 00:27:35,365
You're gonna have to piece it
together from several sources,

329
00:27:35,502 --> 00:27:36,992
and it's not gonna
be 100% pure.

330
00:27:37,104 --> 00:27:38,901
I don't want that.

331
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,067
I know what you
don't want, Frank,

332
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:43,301
but look, what you're
gonna need is to get

333
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,901
to the Chiu-Chou syndicate,
all right?

334
00:27:46,046 --> 00:27:48,480
Cholon, Saigon. If they're
gonna deal with you at all.

335
00:27:48,582 --> 00:27:50,880
I understand that, but by
then it's gonna be too late.

336
00:27:51,018 --> 00:27:53,578
It'll be already chopped up. I wanna
go get it where they go get it from.

337
00:27:53,721 --> 00:27:54,745
I wanna go to the source.

338
00:27:54,888 --> 00:27:55,912
So, you're gonna
go get it yourself?

339
00:27:56,023 --> 00:27:58,014
Why not?

340
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:00,491
Huh? I came this far.

341
00:28:01,228 --> 00:28:02,661
You're gonna go
into the motherfucking jungle?

342
00:28:02,763 --> 00:28:04,128
I'm in the jungle.
Look around.

343
00:28:04,231 --> 00:28:06,028
They're eating these roaches
and whatever that is.

344
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:07,828
Nigga, I'm talking
about snakes, all right?

345
00:28:07,935 --> 00:28:09,698
I'm talking about tigers,
I'm talking about Vietcong,

346
00:28:09,803 --> 00:28:13,500
I'm talking about mosquitoes
that'll fucking kill your ass.

347
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:15,801
You wanna go into the jungle?

348
00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:17,536
We're going.

349
00:28:19,546 --> 00:28:20,843
Fuck it. Let's go.
We're going.

350
00:28:20,948 --> 00:28:22,176
Why not?
Let's go.

351
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:06,752
Hey, Frank.

352
00:29:07,327 --> 00:29:10,421
This whole spot's locked down
by the Kuomintang,

353
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:14,593
General Chiang Kai-shek's
defeated army.

354
00:29:53,207 --> 00:29:55,368
How would you get
it into the States?

355
00:29:55,676 --> 00:29:57,473
You ain't got to
worry about that.

356
00:29:57,578 --> 00:29:58,704
Who do you work
for in there?

357
00:29:58,846 --> 00:30:01,371
You ain't got to worry
about that, either.

358
00:30:01,515 --> 00:30:03,346
Who are you, really?

359
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:06,044
Frank Lucas, says it
right there in my passport.

360
00:30:06,186 --> 00:30:07,881
I mean, who you represent?

361
00:30:07,988 --> 00:30:09,012
Me.

362
00:30:11,225 --> 00:30:14,956
You think you're going to take
100 kilos of heroin into the US,

363
00:30:15,062 --> 00:30:19,055
and you don't work for anyone?
Someone is going to allow that?

364
00:30:19,199 --> 00:30:20,223
That's right.

365
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:30,006
After this first purchase,

366
00:30:30,444 --> 00:30:33,413
if you are not killed
by Marseille importers,

367
00:30:33,747 --> 00:30:36,147
or their people in the States,

368
00:30:36,617 --> 00:30:38,585
then what?

369
00:30:39,219 --> 00:30:42,211
Then there will be more,
much more, I guarantee it.

370
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:47,554
And if it's all the same to you, I don't
wanna have to drag my ass up here no more.

371
00:30:47,694 --> 00:30:49,252
Of course not.

372
00:30:52,032 --> 00:30:53,192
My man.

373
00:30:54,101 --> 00:30:56,001
Soul brother, huh?
Soul brother.

374
00:31:38,478 --> 00:31:43,040
Fifty grand. It's gonna cover them and
the pilot and the boys on the other end.

375
00:31:43,784 --> 00:31:45,251
Give them a hundred.

376
00:31:46,153 --> 00:31:48,087
Fifty is gonna
cover it, Frank.

377
00:31:48,188 --> 00:31:50,884
Give them a hundred, give
them the whole thing. Here.

378
00:31:51,024 --> 00:31:52,286
And look,

379
00:31:53,193 --> 00:31:57,562
that's all I got. So, if that
dope don't arrive for any reason...

380
00:32:00,934 --> 00:32:04,927
Hey, listen, cousin or no
cousin, I'm a busy man, all right?

381
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:08,269
I ain't got no time to be
going to nobody's funeral.

382
00:32:08,775 --> 00:32:10,902
I'll let you know
when it's in the air.

383
00:32:11,511 --> 00:32:12,569
My man.

384
00:32:26,693 --> 00:32:28,024
Fuck.

385
00:32:36,503 --> 00:32:37,595
<i>Richie?
Yeah.</i>

386
00:32:37,704 --> 00:32:38,830
<i>This fucking guy made me.</i>

387
00:32:38,972 --> 00:32:40,803
I don't know how he did,
but he did.

388
00:32:41,508 --> 00:32:42,770
<i>He went for his gun.</i>

389
00:32:43,176 --> 00:32:44,609
I had to do it, man.

390
00:32:44,711 --> 00:32:46,611
There's 100 people out
there that heard the shots.

391
00:32:46,713 --> 00:32:48,840
You gotta help me.
You gotta do something.

392
00:32:49,016 --> 00:32:50,677
Baby.

393
00:32:50,817 --> 00:32:51,841
Where are you, Jay?

394
00:32:53,253 --> 00:32:54,880
That's the problem.

395
00:32:58,025 --> 00:33:01,654
Dispatch, I got a 10-13.
I got a 10-13.

396
00:33:01,762 --> 00:33:03,730
<i>Copy that. What's your 20?</i>

397
00:33:04,164 --> 00:33:05,495
Tower two.

398
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,827
Apartment 1G.

399
00:33:09,536 --> 00:33:11,333
Kent and West in the projects.

400
00:33:11,438 --> 00:33:12,837
<i>Identify yourself, please.</i>

401
00:33:12,939 --> 00:33:14,236
Detective Richie Roberts.

402
00:33:14,374 --> 00:33:17,309
<i>That's a negative.
I got no units in that area.</i>

403
00:33:17,411 --> 00:33:18,742
Bullshit.

404
00:33:18,945 --> 00:33:21,539
Please put the call out again.
I'm gonna need assistance.

405
00:33:21,682 --> 00:33:23,741
<i>Detective Roberts,
I got no units in that area.</i>

406
00:33:23,884 --> 00:33:25,681
<i>That's a negative.</i>

407
00:33:36,563 --> 00:33:37,860
I didn't mention no cops.
Know what I'm saying?

408
00:33:38,031 --> 00:33:39,191
You know what I'm saying?

409
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:41,426
I'll get the motherfucker! Kick his ass!

410
00:33:41,568 --> 00:33:44,196
Yo, cracker,
you gonna pay for this shit!

411
00:33:47,808 --> 00:33:50,834
Where the fuck you going?
Where the fuck you going?

412
00:33:52,746 --> 00:33:54,771
What you gonna do,
motherfucker?

413
00:33:54,915 --> 00:33:59,011
Hey, hey, be cool.
Be cool, all right?

414
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:01,451
I'll find out what's
going on in here.

415
00:34:10,297 --> 00:34:11,628
Richie.

416
00:34:17,137 --> 00:34:18,195
Open the door!

417
00:34:18,305 --> 00:34:19,932
Open the motherfucking door!

418
00:34:20,073 --> 00:34:21,267
Where's your backup?

419
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:22,740
You
motherfucking cracker!

420
00:34:22,843 --> 00:34:25,311
You got no backup?
Why is that?

421
00:34:25,445 --> 00:34:27,140
You gotta come
out sometime, motherfucker!

422
00:34:28,815 --> 00:34:30,009
Bandage his neck.

423
00:34:30,117 --> 00:34:31,243
Richie, he's dead.

424
00:34:31,351 --> 00:34:32,818
I know he's
fucking dead, right.

425
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:34,682
Bandage his neck,
clean up his head,

426
00:34:34,788 --> 00:34:37,154
prop him up on the gurney so he's
sitting and open his fucking eyes.

427
00:34:37,257 --> 00:34:38,315
Open this fucking door!

428
00:34:38,425 --> 00:34:39,722
All right? Let's go.

429
00:34:39,826 --> 00:34:41,259
Fuck.

430
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:46,424
All right, clean him up.

431
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:49,233
Okay.
Where's the solution?

432
00:34:51,204 --> 00:34:52,262
Hey.
Huh?

433
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,838
God damn it,
open this fucking door!

434
00:34:57,511 --> 00:34:58,603
Give me your gun.
What?

435
00:34:58,712 --> 00:35:00,009
Give me your gun.

436
00:35:00,147 --> 00:35:02,911
Get your punk ass
out here, man!

437
00:35:03,016 --> 00:35:05,484
You have your badge?
Yeah.

438
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:07,086
I'm gonna kill
that son of a bitch!

439
00:35:07,187 --> 00:35:08,620
You guys ready?
Uh-huh.

440
00:35:08,722 --> 00:35:10,815
Okay. Just keep
moving forward.

441
00:35:11,558 --> 00:35:13,526
You all right?
Yeah.

442
00:35:14,828 --> 00:35:16,591
It's okay! It's okay!

443
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,691
We're taking him
to the hospital.

444
00:35:18,832 --> 00:35:21,665
Everybody, step back!
Step back!

445
00:35:22,836 --> 00:35:24,133
He's all right.

446
00:35:24,237 --> 00:35:25,864
He's okay.
We're taking care of him.

447
00:35:26,306 --> 00:35:27,773
Step back. Step back.

448
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,538
Everything's fine.
Just stand back.

449
00:35:33,013 --> 00:35:34,207
He's all right.

450
00:35:34,347 --> 00:35:35,644
He's alive.

451
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,910
What happened inside?

452
00:35:38,018 --> 00:35:39,781
We're taking him
to the hospital.

453
00:35:49,062 --> 00:35:50,359
Thanks, man.

454
00:35:51,398 --> 00:35:52,729
Fuck.

455
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:56,167
That asshole pulled a piece on me,
man. Can you fucking believe it?

456
00:35:56,269 --> 00:35:57,736
He pulls a piece on a cop?

457
00:35:57,904 --> 00:36:00,429
I had to do it, man.
Kill or be killed.

458
00:36:01,308 --> 00:36:03,538
Fucking crazy world, right?

459
00:36:06,379 --> 00:36:08,006
What the fuck were you
doing in the projects?

460
00:36:08,114 --> 00:36:11,277
Investigating stuff,
man, you know,

461
00:36:11,751 --> 00:36:15,016
just like you taught me.
Checking on guys,

462
00:36:15,121 --> 00:36:18,579
following things up,
putting the pieces together.

463
00:36:18,725 --> 00:36:22,354
That guy was a dealer. A fucking
dealer. Scum of the earth.

464
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:26,263
That guy didn't pull
a gun on a cop, Jay.

465
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:28,924
That guy pulled a gun
on a junkie,

466
00:36:29,069 --> 00:36:30,468
a junkie who was
trying to rob him.

467
00:36:30,604 --> 00:36:33,038
What the fuck you say?

468
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,705
What the fuck, man?
What are you doing, man?

469
00:36:35,809 --> 00:36:36,798
What the fuck is that?

470
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:38,309
That's my fucking money, man!

471
00:36:38,411 --> 00:36:40,038
I earned this shit.
That's mine!

472
00:36:40,146 --> 00:36:41,807
I earned it doing good cop
work! What the fuck is this?

473
00:36:41,948 --> 00:36:43,643
good cop work!

474
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,342
You murdered a guy!
I earned it getting shot at!

475
00:36:45,452 --> 00:36:47,283
You murdered a guy!

476
00:36:47,854 --> 00:36:49,583
You murdered him,
you robbed his money,

477
00:36:49,689 --> 00:36:51,156
then you called me
to get you out of it.

478
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:53,156
That makes me an accessory
after the fact, motherfucker.

479
00:36:53,293 --> 00:36:57,252
I'll tell you the facts, man. Just write
the report the way I say it happened,

480
00:36:57,364 --> 00:37:01,425
and then that's the way it is,
and that's how it will be.

481
00:37:02,302 --> 00:37:03,963
I can't do that.

482
00:37:04,871 --> 00:37:08,739
I'm a leper because I listened to
you and turned in a million bucks.

483
00:37:08,842 --> 00:37:11,606
No one will work
with me after that.

484
00:37:11,811 --> 00:37:15,941
I can get off this shit,
Richie. That's easy.

485
00:37:16,216 --> 00:37:18,150
Just write the report

486
00:37:18,251 --> 00:37:20,879
between us, as partners.

487
00:37:22,589 --> 00:37:24,113
I can't do that.

488
00:37:26,259 --> 00:37:27,283
Hey!

489
00:37:28,895 --> 00:37:30,988
Stop! Stop!

490
00:37:31,231 --> 00:37:32,664
Fuck it.

491
00:38:11,037 --> 00:38:12,470
Open the trunk.

492
00:38:27,153 --> 00:38:30,680
<i>Peace now!
Peace now! Peace now!</i>

493
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:33,953
<i>LBJ, how many kids
did you kill today?</i>

494
00:38:34,828 --> 00:38:37,922
<i>Get out, get out,
get out of Vietnam!</i>

495
00:38:38,064 --> 00:38:40,931
<i>Get out, get out,
get out of Vietnam!</i>

496
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:44,298
<i>as loud as we can that the
Vietnam War should stop,</i>

497
00:38:44,437 --> 00:38:47,634
<i>and that the best way to stop
it is for the United States</i>

498
00:38:47,774 --> 00:38:50,470
<i>to simply pack up and get
out of Vietnam right now.</i>

499
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:57,906
How we looking?

500
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,549
Typically, what I see is
25% to 45% pure.

501
00:39:04,658 --> 00:39:07,821
I mean, there's no adulterants,
no alkaloids, no dilutants.

502
00:39:08,662 --> 00:39:10,823
It's 100%.

503
00:39:15,301 --> 00:39:16,393
May I?

504
00:39:16,503 --> 00:39:17,800
Take it with you.

505
00:39:19,005 --> 00:39:20,097
Thank you, Frank.

506
00:41:16,923 --> 00:41:21,087
I'll take it. No contingencies,
no loans, no nothing.

507
00:41:22,095 --> 00:41:23,255
Cash.

508
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,697
Fabulous.

509
00:41:30,336 --> 00:41:34,534
I'm not talking about your proclivities,
Richie. Those I only know too well.

510
00:41:34,841 --> 00:41:36,900
I'm talking about being a cop.

511
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:39,535
You're talking
about taking money?

512
00:41:39,646 --> 00:41:40,874
I don't do that.
It's not my thing.

513
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,470
What about your friends
from the neighborhood?

514
00:41:42,582 --> 00:41:44,743
Do you still hang out with them? Yeah.

515
00:41:44,851 --> 00:41:46,113
Play baseball
on the weekends.

516
00:41:46,252 --> 00:41:48,652
Wise guys?
That's gonna look good.

517
00:41:49,122 --> 00:41:51,454
Guys I went to high
school with. So what?

518
00:41:51,624 --> 00:41:53,592
What about Joseph Sodano?

519
00:41:54,828 --> 00:41:55,954
What about him?

520
00:41:56,095 --> 00:41:58,791
Richie, I'm just trying to
understand things your wife has said.

521
00:41:58,898 --> 00:42:00,229
If they're not true, tell me.

522
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:01,891
Yeah, he's one of them.

523
00:42:02,035 --> 00:42:04,299
Is he also your son's godfather? Yeah.

524
00:42:04,604 --> 00:42:06,333
He's definitely fucking her.

525
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:11,133
Do you really care about this? Or
do you just not want her to win ever?

526
00:42:15,048 --> 00:42:18,313
You know, there's an interview
room on the second floor.

527
00:42:18,451 --> 00:42:20,612
That's what I thought. The
door only locks from the inside.

528
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,153
All rise.

529
00:42:28,561 --> 00:42:32,588
Oh, God, Richie. Richie, fuck
me like a cop, not a lawyer!

530
00:42:42,041 --> 00:42:43,668
Don't answer it!

531
00:42:49,582 --> 00:42:50,640
Yeah?

532
00:43:04,731 --> 00:43:06,722
Richie Roberts.
Hey, Norm?

533
00:43:09,502 --> 00:43:10,491
Hey. Richie Roberts.

534
00:43:10,603 --> 00:43:11,661
Hi. Detective Norman Reily.

535
00:43:11,771 --> 00:43:14,137
Hey, Norm. How are you?
Good.

536
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,401
So, is that him?
Yeah.

537
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:28,181
Picked a nice night to come out, huh?
It's like Grand Central around here.

538
00:43:28,288 --> 00:43:29,880
It's been like this.

539
00:43:30,023 --> 00:43:34,357
I'm lucky if I get home by midnight.
It's like nothing we've seen before.

540
00:43:39,232 --> 00:43:41,166
Something I gotta sign?

541
00:43:41,267 --> 00:43:43,167
Yeah. It's right here.

542
00:43:43,269 --> 00:43:45,737
I'm taking this with me. I'll register
it with Essex County, all right?

543
00:43:45,872 --> 00:43:47,430
All right.

544
00:43:49,542 --> 00:43:55,174
<i>America's public enemy number one
in the United States is drug abuse.</i>

545
00:43:56,582 --> 00:43:58,516
<i>In order to fight and
defeat this enemy,</i>

546
00:43:58,618 --> 00:44:03,419
<i>it is necessary to wage a new,
all-out offensive.</i>

547
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:06,452
<i>Federal authorities
have announced their intention</i>

548
00:44:06,592 --> 00:44:09,060
<i>to establish special
narcotics bureaus</i>

549
00:44:09,162 --> 00:44:11,926
<i>in Washington, New York,
Los Angeles, Chicago...</i>

550
00:44:12,065 --> 00:44:14,761
A detective without the
support of his fellow detectives

551
00:44:14,867 --> 00:44:16,858
really can't do much.

552
00:44:18,471 --> 00:44:20,200
You know why I don't have it.

553
00:44:21,307 --> 00:44:23,707
Doesn't matter.
You did what you had to do.

554
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,937
Greatest city in the world! And
it's turning into an open sewer.

555
00:44:28,481 --> 00:44:31,746
Everybody's stealing, dealing.

556
00:44:33,186 --> 00:44:36,553
Look at you. You can't work
because you did your job.

557
00:44:36,656 --> 00:44:40,057
Good news is, you're not
the only honest cop in town.

558
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:44,721
The special narcotics bureau in
Washington is not a dog and pony show.

559
00:44:44,998 --> 00:44:48,399
They are sincere. I know this because
they want us to orchestrate it.

560
00:44:48,501 --> 00:44:50,992
And I want you to head
up things here on our end.

561
00:44:51,137 --> 00:44:53,071
If it's federal, who do I
answer to, the post office?

562
00:44:53,206 --> 00:44:54,468
No, you answer to me,

563
00:44:54,607 --> 00:44:57,007
me and the US Attorney,
nobody else.

564
00:44:58,978 --> 00:45:01,173
You never step foot
in a police station again.

565
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,272
You work out of your own
place, you pick your own guys,

566
00:45:04,384 --> 00:45:06,511
guys that you know would not
take a nickel off the sidewalk.

567
00:45:31,427 --> 00:45:34,760
Well, we got
the lovely transit.

568
00:45:36,832 --> 00:45:39,767
600-year-old
mahogany doors.

569
00:45:42,438 --> 00:45:45,635
Now, look at that.
Can't you just feel it?

570
00:45:46,308 --> 00:45:48,401
I think it's lovely.

571
00:45:48,511 --> 00:45:50,604
Watch your step.

572
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:57,216
Look at these
beautiful floors.

573
00:45:57,319 --> 00:45:59,310
At least, I don't know,
200 years old.

574
00:45:59,422 --> 00:46:01,356
And it's hard to
get the cracks...

575
00:46:01,457 --> 00:46:03,288
Now this was one of
my favorite rooms

576
00:46:03,392 --> 00:46:05,451
but we had some problems
with the plumbing.

577
00:46:05,561 --> 00:46:06,994
I even fixed it.
I know it works.

578
00:46:07,096 --> 00:46:08,495
It's not gonna leak.

579
00:46:12,368 --> 00:46:14,666
Here it is.

580
00:46:21,377 --> 00:46:22,571
You know, I used
to be a really good

581
00:46:22,678 --> 00:46:23,804
piano player
when I was a kid,

582
00:46:23,913 --> 00:46:26,746
but then, I don't
know why I forgot.

583
00:46:27,516 --> 00:46:29,313
Life goes on. Well...

584
00:46:32,054 --> 00:46:34,784
How long are
you gonna be?

585
00:46:36,725 --> 00:46:37,817
Oh, and do me
a favor, please.

586
00:46:37,927 --> 00:46:38,985
Mind the doors.

587
00:46:39,095 --> 00:46:42,826
Those are beautiful, ornate
glass doors, you know.

588
00:46:50,005 --> 00:46:51,563
Here we go, Jimmy.
Come on.

589
00:46:51,674 --> 00:46:53,733
Oh, yeah. Give it back.

590
00:46:59,398 --> 00:47:00,365
Huey's.

591
00:47:00,466 --> 00:47:01,694
<i>Huey. What up, boy?</i>

592
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,926
Yeah, who this?

593
00:47:03,068 --> 00:47:04,558
Who you think it is, boy?

594
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:06,365
<i>Frank.
Frank who?</i>

595
00:47:06,772 --> 00:47:09,366
<i>Frank your brother, negro.
Frankie?</i>

596
00:47:12,177 --> 00:47:13,235
That's right.

597
00:47:13,345 --> 00:47:15,313
Hey, Melvin!
Melvin, where's Ma?

598
00:47:15,447 --> 00:47:17,881
What?
Frank's on the phone!

599
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:19,617
Hey, Ma!
How are you doing, Frankie?

600
00:47:19,751 --> 00:47:21,719
Frank's on the phone!

601
00:47:22,187 --> 00:47:24,212
Say what?
Mama, Frank's on the phone!

602
00:47:24,323 --> 00:47:26,052
Frank? Oh, my Lord!

603
00:47:26,158 --> 00:47:28,319
Yeah, when? Well, you
just say it, man, yeah.

604
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:29,791
Listen, I'm gonna
call y'all back

605
00:47:29,928 --> 00:47:33,329
at 6:00. I want you to get everybody
together, all right? Get Mama, get everybody.

606
00:47:33,465 --> 00:47:35,160
<i>All right?
Okay.</i>

607
00:47:51,116 --> 00:47:52,378
Hey, Frank!

608
00:47:52,484 --> 00:47:53,746
What's happening, Frank?

609
00:47:53,852 --> 00:47:56,412
Hey, Frankie.
How you doing, Uncle Frank?

610
00:47:56,522 --> 00:47:58,854
Get out the car.
Get the kids, get the kids.

611
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:01,849
Look at this, baby.

612
00:48:01,994 --> 00:48:05,987
Oh, my Lord!
I'm so glad to see you, boy.

613
00:48:06,298 --> 00:48:10,758
Oh, I'm telling you, this is
some piece of land you got here!

614
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:13,469
I wonder what the poor
people are doing here?

615
00:48:13,572 --> 00:48:14,937
And whose
house is that, Frankie?

616
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,201
That is your house, Mama.

617
00:48:17,809 --> 00:48:19,970
Mine?
That's yours.

618
00:48:20,846 --> 00:48:22,507
And who else?

619
00:48:23,815 --> 00:48:27,945
Now, there, that's my room right
there, man. Right over there.

620
00:48:34,226 --> 00:48:36,490
Anybody want some
more collard greens?

621
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:42,633
I wanna tell you how happy I am
to see all my children at the table

622
00:48:42,734 --> 00:48:45,202
and the grandchildren
at the same time.

623
00:48:45,337 --> 00:48:47,066
My heart's so happy.
Enjoy yourselves.

624
00:48:47,172 --> 00:48:48,662
Right on, Grandma.

625
00:48:49,408 --> 00:48:51,740
I hope you got a job, boy, the
way you're eating over here.

626
00:48:51,877 --> 00:48:55,711
That boy right there, he got a arm
on him. I mean, a major league arm.

627
00:48:55,847 --> 00:48:56,814
Oh, yeah?

628
00:48:56,915 --> 00:48:58,348
Ain't that right?

629
00:48:58,450 --> 00:48:59,576
Right on, Pop.

630
00:48:59,685 --> 00:49:02,210
Well, we'll see after dinner. We'll
see him throw it around a little bit.

631
00:49:02,354 --> 00:49:04,015
No, no, you can't
catch him, man.

632
00:49:04,122 --> 00:49:05,487
I'm talking about...
I'm talking about...

633
00:49:05,591 --> 00:49:07,252
This guy throw harder
than Gibson.

634
00:49:07,392 --> 00:49:09,656
We're talking
95 miles an hour.

635
00:49:10,062 --> 00:49:12,030
Can you catch him?
He gonna...

636
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:13,654
He gonna catch the ground.

637
00:49:13,765 --> 00:49:16,427
We might've played catch, I think,
when I was about five years old.

638
00:49:16,568 --> 00:49:18,900
Since then, he ain't been
able to keep up.

639
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:24,408
This is your room.
It's perfect.

640
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:27,344
Oh. Why, it's...

641
00:49:27,713 --> 00:49:29,704
Will you look at this?

642
00:49:29,915 --> 00:49:31,382
Oh!

643
00:49:32,117 --> 00:49:35,280
Oh, it's beautiful.
It's beautiful. It's just...

644
00:49:35,887 --> 00:49:36,876
I...

645
00:49:43,462 --> 00:49:44,952
How did you...

646
00:49:45,063 --> 00:49:46,291
I had it made.

647
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,597
From memory.

648
00:49:49,735 --> 00:49:51,896
You were five when they took
it away on me. That's right.

649
00:49:52,004 --> 00:49:53,164
How could you remember it?

650
00:49:53,272 --> 00:49:54,864
How could I forget, Mama?

651
00:49:59,578 --> 00:50:03,105
I'll just
tell you it is perfect.

652
00:50:03,682 --> 00:50:05,877
It's all perfect.

653
00:50:10,922 --> 00:50:13,584
I can't tell you
how much I love you.

654
00:50:13,692 --> 00:50:15,421
I love you, too, Mama.

655
00:50:16,194 --> 00:50:17,320
It's okay.

656
00:50:26,138 --> 00:50:28,163
Both these guys,
good with wires,

657
00:50:28,307 --> 00:50:29,899
they got solid informants,

658
00:50:30,008 --> 00:50:32,499
and they're honest
and they're fearless.

659
00:50:33,045 --> 00:50:35,570
They're insane,
Richie, like you.

660
00:50:36,114 --> 00:50:37,604
Where are they?

661
00:50:39,818 --> 00:50:43,345
That's Jones with
the skinny white broad.

662
00:50:43,455 --> 00:50:45,116
Best I ever seen
on the street.

663
00:50:45,223 --> 00:50:48,750
He knows dope, but he's
together, all right?

664
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:51,260
He's a stand-up
guy all round.

665
00:50:51,363 --> 00:50:54,855
And that's Abruzzo
with the two fat black ones.

666
00:50:55,901 --> 00:50:58,426
He loves a big ass, man.

667
00:50:58,804 --> 00:51:03,138
He's a bulldog. He don't fuck around,
all right. He's got a bit of a temper,

668
00:51:03,275 --> 00:51:06,642
yeah, but you can trust this
guy with your grandmother.

669
00:51:06,978 --> 00:51:09,037
Listen, Richie.
We work together.

670
00:51:09,147 --> 00:51:11,638
You want me,
you gotta take them, too.

671
00:51:23,795 --> 00:51:24,887
When do we start?

672
00:51:28,066 --> 00:51:31,035
The man I worked for, he had one of
the biggest companies in New York City.

673
00:51:31,136 --> 00:51:33,798
He ran it for more
than 50 years.

674
00:51:34,072 --> 00:51:37,803
Fifteen years, eight
months and nine days,

675
00:51:37,909 --> 00:51:39,501
I was with him every day.
I worked for him,

676
00:51:39,644 --> 00:51:43,375
I protected him, I looked
after him, I learned from him.

677
00:51:43,882 --> 00:51:46,510
Bumpy was rich, but he wasn't
white man rich, you see?

678
00:51:46,618 --> 00:51:48,085
He wasn't wealthy.

679
00:51:48,186 --> 00:51:50,518
He didn't own his own company.
He thought he did, but he didn't,

680
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,213
he just managed it.

681
00:51:52,357 --> 00:51:54,723
The white man owned it,
so they owned him.

682
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,225
Nobody owns me, though.
Hey.

683
00:51:56,361 --> 00:51:58,295
How you doing, babe?
Good.

684
00:51:58,397 --> 00:52:01,025
That's 'cause I own my own company,
and my company sells a product

685
00:52:01,166 --> 00:52:03,794
that's better than
the competition,

686
00:52:04,403 --> 00:52:07,395
at a price that's lower
than the competition.

687
00:52:08,173 --> 00:52:09,970
Well, what are
we selling here, Frank?

688
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:27,415
How you doing, Red?

689
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:29,322
These are my brothers, just
got here from North Carolina.

690
00:52:29,428 --> 00:52:30,486
Everybody, this is Redtop.

691
00:52:30,595 --> 00:52:31,994
Hello.
How you doing?

692
00:52:32,097 --> 00:52:34,531
And the ladies.
Hey.

693
00:52:34,633 --> 00:52:37,830
What wrong? Y'all niggas ain't
never seen hoochie before?

694
00:52:38,103 --> 00:52:39,229
Why are
they all naked?

695
00:52:39,371 --> 00:52:41,100
So they
can't steal nothing.

696
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,664
Oh, right.

697
00:52:43,642 --> 00:52:48,341
The most important thing in business
is honesty, integrity, hard work,

698
00:52:49,414 --> 00:52:50,745
family,

699
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,676
never forgetting
where we came from.

700
00:52:53,919 --> 00:52:55,443
Thank you, Charlene.

701
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:03,289
See, you are what
you are in this world,

702
00:53:03,762 --> 00:53:06,094
that's either one
of two things.

703
00:53:07,299 --> 00:53:09,358
Either you're somebody,

704
00:53:10,235 --> 00:53:12,567
or you're nobody.
Be right back.

705
00:53:28,653 --> 00:53:30,951
I need these fresh. 'Cause if I
have to come back here and get you,

706
00:53:31,089 --> 00:53:32,078
you know what it is.
Tango.

707
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:33,714
Don't y'all play that.
Yes, sir, I hear you.

708
00:53:33,825 --> 00:53:35,793
You won't have to come back.
There won't be no problem.

709
00:53:35,927 --> 00:53:37,451
What about you,
Frank? You need anything?

710
00:53:37,596 --> 00:53:39,655
Where's my money?
Redtop gave you the package.

711
00:53:39,798 --> 00:53:41,322
You're supposed to be
handing me my money.

712
00:53:41,466 --> 00:53:43,161
Here's a jar right here.
Twenty percent.

713
00:53:43,301 --> 00:53:45,895
Oh, you got the jar?
That's right.

714
00:53:46,872 --> 00:53:48,305
Get the fuck out of here...
Oh! What you gonna do?

715
00:53:49,674 --> 00:53:52,165
What the fuck you gonna do,
Frank? Huh? What you doing?

716
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:56,610
You gonna shoot me in front of
everybody? Huh? Come on.

717
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:00,312
Shit.

718
00:54:12,163 --> 00:54:14,996
There you go.
Twenty percent.

719
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,371
So, what was I saying?

720
00:54:49,651 --> 00:54:50,618
Jones.

721
00:54:52,521 --> 00:54:54,216
Jonesy.

722
00:54:56,191 --> 00:54:57,624
That was nice, man.

723
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,584
Just doing my melodious thing, baby.

724
00:55:00,762 --> 00:55:02,286
Got you.

725
00:55:09,121 --> 00:55:12,454
This is the newly formed
Essex County Narcotics Squad.

726
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:17,420
Our mandate is to make major
arrests. No street guys.

727
00:55:18,497 --> 00:55:21,591
We're looking for the
suppliers and the distributors.

728
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:24,828
Heroin, cocaine, amphetamines.
No grass under 1,000 pounds.

729
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:26,665
No powder under 40 kilograms.

730
00:55:26,805 --> 00:55:28,739
Any less than that, then somebody
else can waste their time.

731
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:32,571
We gonna be handling the big shipments,
the big money and the big temptation.

732
00:55:32,677 --> 00:55:33,905
I heard
a story about you.

733
00:55:34,012 --> 00:55:36,776
That you found a million
dollars in unmarked cash

734
00:55:36,882 --> 00:55:39,680
and gave that shit back.
Is that true?

735
00:55:40,352 --> 00:55:43,515
Yeah, I did. Anybody
got a problem with that?

736
00:55:47,492 --> 00:55:49,585
So do I, you know?
I think about it every day.

737
00:55:49,694 --> 00:55:52,663
I should be down in South Florida with
a 68-foot cruiser doing fishing charters.

738
00:55:52,797 --> 00:55:53,821
You and me, both.

739
00:55:53,932 --> 00:55:57,129
But you know,
I didn't, so here I am,

740
00:55:57,235 --> 00:55:59,635
and we'll be looking to land
other kind of sharks.

741
00:56:27,265 --> 00:56:29,324
All right?
Bingo.

742
00:56:52,524 --> 00:56:54,651
See that, Richie?
Yeah.

743
00:56:54,759 --> 00:56:57,694
And this stuff is
your everyday stuff.

744
00:56:57,796 --> 00:57:00,663
But this Blue Magic,
twice the potency.

745
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:05,463
I mean, it's the purest thing I ever seen
in the streets. It's strong enough to smoke.

746
00:57:05,604 --> 00:57:08,539
And that's for those white suburban
kids who are scared of needles.

747
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,301
I paid 10
bucks for that.

748
00:57:10,575 --> 00:57:13,203
And it's everywhere. I mean,
it's on every corner out there.

749
00:57:13,345 --> 00:57:15,074
So, how is that possible?

750
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:18,616
Who can afford to sell shit
twice as good for half as much?

751
00:57:26,758 --> 00:57:29,124
Hey, man. Frankie,
baby, good to see you!

752
00:57:29,227 --> 00:57:30,159
Everything's good?

753
00:57:30,295 --> 00:57:31,421
Yeah, man, just got back
from Europe,

754
00:57:31,529 --> 00:57:34,054
over there for two months,
south of France, man.

755
00:57:36,835 --> 00:57:40,635
Look right, look right.
Wonderful, wonderful.

756
00:57:42,707 --> 00:57:44,174
Nicky!

757
00:57:45,644 --> 00:57:46,838
Give us a smile, Nicky.

758
00:57:46,978 --> 00:57:48,172
Show us the cover.

759
00:57:48,313 --> 00:57:49,473
You know what
I'm saying, man?

760
00:57:49,581 --> 00:57:50,843
Hey, Nicky, over here.

761
00:57:50,982 --> 00:57:52,313
There you go.

762
00:57:54,686 --> 00:57:56,017
Nicky!

763
00:57:57,689 --> 00:58:00,487
Who is that?
Look at you, my man.

764
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,024
All right.

765
00:58:10,168 --> 00:58:11,658
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

766
00:58:11,803 --> 00:58:14,465
<i>the Brown Bomber! The champ!</i>

767
00:58:14,572 --> 00:58:16,199
<i>Mr. Joe Louis!</i>

768
00:58:25,317 --> 00:58:26,875
Who's that with Joe?

769
00:58:27,218 --> 00:58:29,118
Miss Puerto Rico.

770
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:30,847
Puerto Rico?
Mmm-hmm.

771
00:58:30,989 --> 00:58:32,115
Is she a beauty queen?

772
00:58:32,223 --> 00:58:34,316
For real. The beauty queen.

773
00:58:58,583 --> 00:59:01,416
Welcome.
My main man. My main man.

774
00:59:06,691 --> 00:59:08,158
Can you all excuse us
for a minute, please?

775
00:59:08,259 --> 00:59:09,317
Yeah, sure, Frank.

776
00:59:09,427 --> 00:59:11,122
Yes, sir.

777
00:59:12,197 --> 00:59:13,630
Thank you.

778
00:59:17,435 --> 00:59:18,834
What's going on?

779
00:59:18,937 --> 00:59:20,632
What you smiling about?
I don't know.

780
00:59:20,739 --> 00:59:23,367
What is this? Huh?
What's what?

781
00:59:23,508 --> 00:59:25,567
What's what?
Come here.

782
00:59:27,178 --> 00:59:28,475
What is that you got on?

783
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:30,138
What's what, man?

784
00:59:30,248 --> 00:59:32,182
Yeah, that! What you got on.

785
00:59:32,283 --> 00:59:33,545
This is a very,
very, very nice suit.

786
00:59:33,685 --> 00:59:36,984
That's a very, very, very nice suit, huh?
That's a clown suit. That's a costume...

787
00:59:37,088 --> 00:59:39,921
that says "Arrest Me. "

788
00:59:40,058 --> 00:59:41,184
You understand?
You're too loud.

789
00:59:41,292 --> 00:59:43,157
You're making too much noise.
Look at me.

790
00:59:43,261 --> 00:59:47,755
The loudest one in the room is the
weakest one in the room. I told you that.

791
00:59:47,899 --> 00:59:50,424
All right? What, are you trying
to be like Nicky Barnes, now?

792
00:59:50,568 --> 00:59:52,035
What's your problem with
Nicky, man? I like Nicky.

793
00:59:52,137 --> 00:59:53,695
I ain't got no problem with
Nicky. Oh, you like Nicky?

794
00:59:53,805 --> 00:59:55,067
Yeah!
You want to be like Nicky?

795
00:59:55,206 --> 00:59:57,868
You want to be superfly?
You wanna work for him?

796
00:59:57,976 --> 00:59:59,773
Share a jail cell with him?
Maybe cook for him?

797
00:59:59,911 --> 01:00:00,900
He wants to talk to you.

798
01:00:01,045 --> 01:00:03,912
Oh, so now you talking to
him about me? What? You...

799
01:00:04,048 --> 01:00:05,572
About what? What is it about?
It ain't like that.

800
01:00:05,683 --> 01:00:06,945
Then what is it like?
We were talking,

801
01:00:07,051 --> 01:00:08,951
your name came up.
About what?

802
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:12,113
I don't know, man.
I told him I'd tell you.

803
01:00:13,792 --> 01:00:15,282
You know... Boy, you...

804
01:00:17,128 --> 01:00:19,790
You know, if you wasn't my brother,
I'd kill you. You know that, don't you?

805
01:00:19,931 --> 01:00:21,626
I'd blow your
motherfucking brains out.

806
01:00:21,766 --> 01:00:22,755
Come on, man.
Don't be like that.

807
01:00:22,867 --> 01:00:24,164
I'm taking you
shopping this week.

808
01:00:24,269 --> 01:00:26,100
I went shopping.
I can tell.

809
01:00:26,237 --> 01:00:28,899
<i>See deep into you</i>

810
01:00:29,474 --> 01:00:33,911
<i>And know what
you're thinking now</i>

811
01:00:35,146 --> 01:00:36,670
<i>And if I'm what you're needing</i>

812
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:42,867
<i>I need some kind of sign</i>

813
01:00:43,371 --> 01:00:48,968
<i>Let me know,
'cause I can't read your mind</i>

814
01:00:49,744 --> 01:00:53,646
<i>Are you in or am I
in this on my own?</i>

815
01:00:54,015 --> 01:00:56,142
<i>I need some clue from you</i>

816
01:00:56,951 --> 01:00:58,612
It's a tax thing.

817
01:00:58,953 --> 01:01:00,648
It's a mistake my lawyers
are straightening out,

818
01:01:00,755 --> 01:01:02,313
but for the time being...

819
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:04,082
How much do
you owe, Joe?

820
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:07,987
It's nothing.
It's like...

821
01:01:08,196 --> 01:01:09,322
Fifty grand.

822
01:01:11,165 --> 01:01:12,826
You got it.

823
01:01:13,868 --> 01:01:15,199
Thank you, man.

824
01:01:15,369 --> 01:01:16,734
Hey, I'm gonna pay
you back as soon as I...

825
01:01:16,837 --> 01:01:20,238
Joe, this ain't no loan.
It's a gift. All right?

826
01:01:20,341 --> 01:01:22,901
All you did for Bumpy,
we owe you.

827
01:01:23,477 --> 01:01:25,570
Keep your chin up.
All right? Okay?

828
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,170
All you have which
is down there. Down.

829
01:01:27,281 --> 01:01:28,714
Chin down.

830
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:31,309
All right. Doc, will
see you, okay?

831
01:01:33,821 --> 01:01:35,254
<i>You play it so cool</i>

832
01:01:35,356 --> 01:01:36,482
Hey!

833
01:01:38,259 --> 01:01:39,954
You still owe me
that dance, right?

834
01:01:40,061 --> 01:01:41,426
Doc, come on.

835
01:01:41,529 --> 01:01:43,929
Frank, check this.

836
01:01:54,642 --> 01:01:56,269
How you doing?
Hi.

837
01:01:56,377 --> 01:01:57,366
Frank Lucas.

838
01:01:57,478 --> 01:01:58,467
Eva Kendo.

839
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,372
Nice to meet you, Eva.

840
01:02:00,481 --> 01:02:02,415
Nice to meet you,
Frank.

841
01:02:03,451 --> 01:02:05,442
You're Frank and
this is your place?

842
01:02:05,553 --> 01:02:08,579
That's right. I'm Frank
and this is my place.

843
01:02:09,523 --> 01:02:11,252
Why is it called
Small's?

844
01:02:11,425 --> 01:02:13,188
Why don't you
call it Frank's?

845
01:02:14,662 --> 01:02:18,189
When you own something, you
can call it what you want.

846
01:02:18,332 --> 01:02:19,594
Small's.

847
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:22,498
Or Frank's.
Frankie Small's.

848
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:24,628
Small's Frankie.

849
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:27,573
That's right.

850
01:02:28,075 --> 01:02:30,134
You want to let
my hand go?

851
01:02:31,646 --> 01:02:32,806
Okay.

852
01:02:34,215 --> 01:02:35,273
You leaving?

853
01:02:35,383 --> 01:02:36,782
No, I was going
to my table.

854
01:02:36,884 --> 01:02:39,352
Okay. Need somebody
to go with you?

855
01:02:41,522 --> 01:02:42,682
Yes?
Mmm-hmm.

856
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:47,284
All the cheesies.

857
01:02:47,395 --> 01:02:49,124
Right here, here we go.
What have we got here?

858
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:50,492
Wash your hands?

859
01:02:50,598 --> 01:02:51,792
I got one print of that,
don't smudge it.

860
01:02:51,899 --> 01:02:53,662
Yeah.
There you go.

861
01:02:56,286 --> 01:02:57,048
Hey, Spearman, what
about him? Who is that?

862
01:02:57,154 --> 01:02:59,247
Joey Sodano.
Don Cattano's nephew.

863
01:02:59,389 --> 01:03:00,879
Yeah, yeah. Put him
up there by the big man.

864
01:03:00,991 --> 01:03:02,390
He looks
like your uncle, Abruzzo.

865
01:03:02,492 --> 01:03:03,618
Yeah, but he's not
as handsome.

866
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,921
He looks more like your
sister. Where's Ice Pick's mug?

867
01:03:06,063 --> 01:03:07,052
Yeah, that's funny.

868
01:03:07,164 --> 01:03:08,392
Maybe you guys should
take that show on the road.

869
01:03:08,498 --> 01:03:10,898
So we need Ice Pick Paul.

870
01:03:11,001 --> 01:03:12,366
Ice Pick Paul?
Yeah.

871
01:03:12,469 --> 01:03:13,936
There you go.
Get him up.

872
01:03:14,071 --> 01:03:16,631
Ice Pick Paul,
he goes way up there, up top.

873
01:03:16,773 --> 01:03:20,174
No, Ice Pick Paul, he's a fucking
soldier. This guy's a lieutenant.

874
01:03:20,277 --> 01:03:21,437
How's that even
fucking possible?

875
01:03:21,545 --> 01:03:22,910
That's Benny
the Bishop.

876
01:03:24,481 --> 01:03:27,644
That guy is a soldier. This guy's a
lieutenant. No way that guy's on top.

877
01:03:27,784 --> 01:03:29,547
You thinking of
Benny the Bishop.

878
01:03:29,653 --> 01:03:32,554
Vinnie Two Socks is fucking
Cattano's deadbeat son-in-law.

879
01:03:32,656 --> 01:03:33,748
Jonesy's right.

880
01:03:33,857 --> 01:03:35,984
Hey, which one of you guys has ever
actually seen Ice Pick Paul selling drugs?

881
01:03:36,093 --> 01:03:37,458
Actually seen it go down?

882
01:03:40,246 --> 01:03:41,144
Yeah, seen it go down.

883
01:03:41,314 --> 01:03:42,906
Been in his place.
Seen him handle drugs.

884
01:03:43,016 --> 01:03:44,916
That rat, Ricky,
has told us...

885
01:03:45,018 --> 01:03:48,351
He's fucking dead.
About four weeks ago.

886
01:03:49,489 --> 01:03:50,649
He's dead.

887
01:03:50,757 --> 01:03:51,746
All right, well,

888
01:03:51,858 --> 01:03:53,018
we can take him off
the fucking board.

889
01:03:53,126 --> 01:03:57,563
I don't think we got any solid
evidence on anybody on that board.

890
01:03:58,197 --> 01:03:59,562
What you saying, Richie?

891
01:03:59,732 --> 01:04:01,097
This is weeks and
weeks of work, man.

892
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,861
I'm saying, take it down.

893
01:04:03,036 --> 01:04:04,697
We got to start again
from the street.

894
01:07:19,132 --> 01:07:20,656
<i>Hi, who's this?</i>

895
01:07:20,766 --> 01:07:24,099
<i>Hello? Gabe? Yeah, it's Scott. Yeah.</i>

896
01:07:24,303 --> 01:07:26,737
<i>Scotty! What's going
down, brother?</i>

897
01:07:26,839 --> 01:07:28,204
<i>Those snow tires you
gave me last night.</i>

898
01:07:28,374 --> 01:07:29,739
<i>They come in yet?</i>

899
01:07:29,842 --> 01:07:31,605
<i>Oh, the snow tires?</i>

900
01:07:31,777 --> 01:07:33,574
<i>Yeah. I want some
more of them.</i>

901
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:34,904
<i>Give me one-and-a-half
more.</i>

902
01:07:35,081 --> 01:07:36,139
<i>One-and-a-half,</i>

903
01:07:36,249 --> 01:07:37,841
that's a pretty big order.

904
01:07:38,017 --> 01:07:39,644
<i>Yeah, I want the
big whitewalls,</i>

905
01:07:39,752 --> 01:07:42,118
<i>they better get at least
100,000 miles.</i>

906
01:07:42,221 --> 01:07:44,155
All right,
I'll tell you what.

907
01:07:44,323 --> 01:07:46,257
You come in here
tomorrow morning

908
01:07:46,392 --> 01:07:47,916
<i>I'm gonna set
you up real nice</i>

909
01:07:48,094 --> 01:07:49,652
<i>with a whitewall special,
all right?</i>

910
01:07:49,762 --> 01:07:50,729
<i>Thanks, bro.</i>

911
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:51,854
<i>No problem.</i>

912
01:07:54,267 --> 01:07:57,862
That's considerably more than
one year's salary, Richie.

913
01:07:58,304 --> 01:08:00,033
If it disappears, I will not
be able to get it for you again.

914
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:05,584
That's yours.

915
01:08:05,828 --> 01:08:10,128
Signing my life away again,
for a lousy twenty grand.

916
01:08:13,502 --> 01:08:15,026
It has to be
Blue Magic, right?

917
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:17,138
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's gonna be Blue.

918
01:08:17,239 --> 01:08:18,297
You can pick it up
here tomorrow.

919
01:08:18,407 --> 01:08:19,499
$20,000.

920
01:08:19,608 --> 01:08:21,508
Just leave it there.

921
01:08:35,391 --> 01:08:37,222
How'd you do?
Good.

922
01:08:39,261 --> 01:08:40,728
Here he comes.

923
01:08:40,863 --> 01:08:42,296
That's him?
Yep.

924
01:08:43,599 --> 01:08:45,191
That was quick.

925
01:08:56,845 --> 01:08:58,244
Richie, if he goes in the
city, what do we fucking do?

926
01:08:58,380 --> 01:08:59,972
Stay with the fucking money,
that's what we do.

927
01:09:00,082 --> 01:09:01,140
We stay with the money,
all right?

928
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:02,512
We can't go
in the fucking city.

929
01:09:02,618 --> 01:09:04,415
Yes, we can. That's 20
grand in there, all right,

930
01:09:04,553 --> 01:09:06,487
that I'm responsible for.
I ain't losing it.

931
01:09:06,588 --> 01:09:08,180
It's out
of our jurisdiction!

932
01:09:08,290 --> 01:09:10,724
Follow the money! All
right, all right, all right!

933
01:09:25,591 --> 01:09:26,853
He's pulling over.

934
01:09:26,959 --> 01:09:29,018
All right, here we go.

935
01:09:29,127 --> 01:09:30,458
Let me out here.

936
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:33,822
Don't disappear, all right?

937
01:09:33,932 --> 01:09:34,660
I'll circle the block.

938
01:09:37,369 --> 01:09:38,063
Move!

939
01:09:55,721 --> 01:09:59,020
Hey! Who's the fuck?
You gotta fucking move!

940
01:10:10,636 --> 01:10:12,126
Police Officer.
I'm commandeering

941
01:10:12,237 --> 01:10:13,670
your vehicle.
Get out of the car.

942
01:10:14,373 --> 01:10:16,364
Who the fuck cares about you?
This is New York City, man.

943
01:10:16,475 --> 01:10:17,533
Get someone else's car!

944
01:10:17,643 --> 01:10:18,632
Get out of the car.

945
01:10:18,744 --> 01:10:21,076
Come on, man.
Can't we live in peace...

946
01:12:29,157 --> 01:12:31,022
Frankie, Frankie! Sit down.

947
01:12:31,159 --> 01:12:32,524
What?

948
01:12:33,327 --> 01:12:35,955
Happy birthday, gentlemen.
How you doing, huh?

949
01:12:36,064 --> 01:12:39,625
He's about to do something,
huh? He's going bowling?

950
01:12:40,501 --> 01:12:42,025
Look at that. Strike.

951
01:12:42,170 --> 01:12:43,364
Hey, what's between your legs?
What's in the bag?

952
01:12:43,504 --> 01:12:45,131
Nothing. Get up, you
fucker. Get the fuck up!

953
01:12:45,239 --> 01:12:46,297
Knock it off.

954
01:12:46,407 --> 01:12:47,738
Shut the fuck up!
What did I tell you?

955
01:12:47,875 --> 01:12:48,967
Keep your
fucking head down.

956
01:12:49,077 --> 01:12:50,135
Shut up!
Whose bag is this?

957
01:12:50,244 --> 01:12:51,711
What're you doing?
Sit down and shut up!

958
01:12:51,846 --> 01:12:53,006
Don't you move!

959
01:13:05,226 --> 01:13:07,660
Hey, guys? Guys! Officers!

960
01:13:08,696 --> 01:13:11,426
Hey, I'm Richie Roberts,
from Newark.

961
01:13:13,201 --> 01:13:14,896
That's my money.

962
01:13:15,536 --> 01:13:18,528
What the fuck? What
money, huh? What money?

963
01:13:19,741 --> 01:13:21,333
The bills are
sequenced, right?

964
01:13:21,442 --> 01:13:24,605
They're registered with the Essex County
Prosecutor's Office. Just check them out.

965
01:13:24,746 --> 01:13:27,681
They all start with CF3500.
Have a look.

966
01:13:33,221 --> 01:13:34,347
Fucking registers.

967
01:13:34,455 --> 01:13:37,686
I thought I had a fucking
Chris-Craft sitting in my driveway.

968
01:13:37,792 --> 01:13:40,727
Honest mistake.
I'll just get the money.

969
01:13:42,263 --> 01:13:44,288
This time.
All right.

970
01:13:44,966 --> 01:13:47,230
There it is.
All right. Thank you.

971
01:13:47,335 --> 01:13:50,099
When was the last time
I was in Jersey? Let me think.

972
01:13:52,273 --> 01:13:53,433
Never.

973
01:13:55,476 --> 01:13:57,535
What're you doing,
coming over here unannounced?

974
01:13:57,645 --> 01:13:59,078
You don't think you could
get hurt doing that?

975
01:14:01,899 --> 01:14:04,163
You got your fucking
money, Richie.

976
01:14:05,202 --> 01:14:09,138
And never, ever come into
this city again unannounced.

977
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,606
You come in to see
a fucking Broadway show,

978
01:14:11,709 --> 01:14:14,837
you call ahead first,
see if it's okay with me.

979
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:18,148
No problem. All right.

980
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:23,848
Let's go, hit some balls.

981
01:14:23,955 --> 01:14:25,149
Great suits, pal.

982
01:14:27,091 --> 01:14:28,683
Is that your car?

983
01:14:29,193 --> 01:14:31,218
That's a fucking
great car.

984
01:14:31,329 --> 01:14:33,854
Have a nice fucking
trip back to Jersey.

985
01:14:33,998 --> 01:14:35,124
All right.

986
01:14:35,232 --> 01:14:37,723
Come on, I got a tee time. Let's go.

987
01:14:41,772 --> 01:14:43,467
What were you doin' there?

988
01:14:43,608 --> 01:14:45,269
Well, that's where this
dope is coming from.

989
01:14:45,443 --> 01:14:47,104
Blue Magic, it's coming
out of New York.

990
01:14:47,211 --> 01:14:48,803
What do you expect
me to do, ignore it?

991
01:14:48,913 --> 01:14:52,178
The cab driver has filed aggravated
assault and grand theft charges

992
01:14:52,283 --> 01:14:53,648
which he may reconsider

993
01:14:53,751 --> 01:14:57,243
depending on how much the State
of New Jersey offers to settle.

994
01:14:58,022 --> 01:15:00,820
I showed him my ID.
I told him I was a cop.

995
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:04,624
You stole his cab
and you knock him out.

996
01:15:04,795 --> 01:15:07,059
I was chasing the 20 grand, all right?

997
01:15:07,832 --> 01:15:10,926
Next time, knock him out
before you show him your badge.

998
01:15:12,703 --> 01:15:16,469
Look, I don't want to hear about
you going into New York again.

999
01:15:17,441 --> 01:15:18,772
Well, then this
investigation's over.

1000
01:15:18,943 --> 01:15:20,274
You're not
listening to me.

1001
01:15:20,378 --> 01:15:22,676
I said, "I don't want to hear about
you going into New York again. "

1002
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:24,042
You do whatever
you have to do.

1003
01:15:24,215 --> 01:15:25,477
You go wherever
you have to go

1004
01:15:25,583 --> 01:15:28,143
to figure out who's bringing
this shit into the country.

1005
01:15:28,252 --> 01:15:30,248
Just don't tell me
about it.

1006
01:15:35,126 --> 01:15:36,525
There's your girl,
right there.

1007
01:15:41,298 --> 01:15:43,198
Hey, how'd you do?
Hi.

1008
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:45,359
I didn't keep you waiting
long, did I? No. Fine.

1009
01:15:45,469 --> 01:15:48,597
Good. A woman as beautiful
as you shouldn't have to wait.

1010
01:15:49,674 --> 01:15:51,471
For anything.

1011
01:15:56,714 --> 01:15:59,512
Thank you, ma'am.
You as pretty as ever.

1012
01:16:04,155 --> 01:16:05,179
Hey, Doc.

1013
01:16:05,289 --> 01:16:06,256
Tommy!

1014
01:16:06,357 --> 01:16:08,621
Heard your boy scored
two touchdowns last week.

1015
01:16:08,726 --> 01:16:10,057
Sure. Sure do make
father proud.

1016
01:16:10,227 --> 01:16:11,592
All right.

1017
01:16:20,705 --> 01:16:22,468
This is your father?

1018
01:16:25,592 --> 01:16:27,423
That's Martin Luther King.

1019
01:16:28,428 --> 01:16:30,293
It is not. It is.
It is Martin Luther King.

1020
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:31,897
You know, "I have a dream"?

1021
01:16:31,999 --> 01:16:33,261
Of course.

1022
01:16:33,367 --> 01:16:35,164
No, that's...

1023
01:16:35,302 --> 01:16:38,794
He was just as important
as Martin Luther King to me.

1024
01:16:38,939 --> 01:16:40,804
What did he do?

1025
01:16:40,941 --> 01:16:43,933
A lot of things.
He was a friend

1026
01:16:44,544 --> 01:16:47,308
and served New York.
New York served him.

1027
01:16:48,015 --> 01:16:49,607
He was my boss.

1028
01:16:49,883 --> 01:16:51,145
My teacher.

1029
01:16:51,284 --> 01:16:52,751
What did he teach you?

1030
01:16:52,886 --> 01:16:55,184
He taught me a
lot of things. He

1031
01:16:57,391 --> 01:16:59,825
taught me how to take my time.

1032
01:17:00,961 --> 01:17:04,954
Taught me that if I was going to do
something, to do it with care, with love.

1033
01:17:05,866 --> 01:17:07,424
Anything else?

1034
01:17:11,872 --> 01:17:13,999
He taught me
to be a gentleman.

1035
01:17:14,141 --> 01:17:15,199
That's what you are?

1036
01:17:15,342 --> 01:17:17,503
That's what I try to be.
Come here.

1037
01:17:19,012 --> 01:17:20,877
Come here. Sit right here.

1038
01:17:23,183 --> 01:17:24,343
Look at me.

1039
01:17:25,419 --> 01:17:28,479
I own about five apartments
in Manhattan.

1040
01:17:29,923 --> 01:17:33,916
Homes all over the East Coast, I could have
taken you to any one of them, but I didn't.

1041
01:17:34,027 --> 01:17:35,119
I brought you here.
Frank,

1042
01:17:35,228 --> 01:17:36,627
I was looking for you, boy.

1043
01:17:36,730 --> 01:17:38,755
Because I wanted you
to meet my mother.

1044
01:17:38,865 --> 01:17:40,423
How you doing, Ma?

1045
01:17:40,534 --> 01:17:41,660
Is this her?

1046
01:17:41,768 --> 01:17:43,326
Eva, this is my mother.
Hi, Eva.

1047
01:17:43,437 --> 01:17:44,597
Oh!

1048
01:17:44,704 --> 01:17:46,069
Nice to meet you.

1049
01:17:46,173 --> 01:17:47,800
She's beautiful!
Yeah?

1050
01:17:47,908 --> 01:17:52,902
Look at her, Frank. She's an
angel come down from heaven.

1051
01:17:53,046 --> 01:17:54,638
Thank you.

1052
01:18:02,355 --> 01:18:06,485
Mr. Roberts? I'm here
for our appointment.

1053
01:18:10,030 --> 01:18:11,861
Morning.
Morning.

1054
01:18:14,034 --> 01:18:15,934
Sorry. Our appointment?

1055
01:18:16,069 --> 01:18:18,230
Child Social Services.

1056
01:18:32,319 --> 01:18:35,220
She did mention
your name, though.

1057
01:18:35,322 --> 01:18:36,482
The stewardess?

1058
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:38,387
No, not the stewardess.

1059
01:18:39,159 --> 01:18:42,754
The lady from Child Services.
She mentioned your name.

1060
01:18:42,929 --> 01:18:46,888
Right after she asked me if I
associated with any criminals.

1061
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:47,967
All right, go! Go, go!

1062
01:18:48,068 --> 01:18:49,228
Yeah!
You wanna see this?

1063
01:18:49,336 --> 01:18:50,928
Hey, boys.

1064
01:18:51,071 --> 01:18:52,834
Joey. Hey, Joey!

1065
01:18:52,939 --> 01:18:54,634
Get in the pool. Go on.

1066
01:18:55,842 --> 01:18:57,571
Come on. Come on.

1067
01:19:01,848 --> 01:19:03,577
So, how'd she get my name?

1068
01:19:03,984 --> 01:19:05,474
Laurie.
Hmm.

1069
01:19:06,453 --> 01:19:08,785
She's been saying
a lot lately.

1070
01:19:09,623 --> 01:19:10,817
A lot.

1071
01:19:14,661 --> 01:19:17,221
You know, when you asked me
to be your son's godfather,

1072
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:18,490
I took it very seriously.

1073
01:19:18,632 --> 01:19:20,497
I know. I know and
I appreciate that.

1074
01:19:20,634 --> 01:19:23,569
And I said yes, I would
take on this responsibility.

1075
01:19:23,670 --> 01:19:26,230
Take care of your son, if God
forbid, something happened to you.

1076
01:19:26,339 --> 01:19:29,240
Joe, the kind of things she's
saying to Child Social Services

1077
01:19:29,342 --> 01:19:32,004
made me look really bad,
all right. You know,

1078
01:19:32,145 --> 01:19:36,639
out at all kinds of hours at night
time, lowlife informants around, women.

1079
01:19:36,783 --> 01:19:38,648
Old friends like me.

1080
01:19:39,286 --> 01:19:41,584
Old friends like you, yeah.

1081
01:19:42,889 --> 01:19:45,119
Uncle Joey, watch me, okay?

1082
01:19:48,695 --> 01:19:50,287
Okay, I understand.

1083
01:19:50,397 --> 01:19:54,424
They ask me, I'll tell them what you
want me to tell them. I'll lie for you.

1084
01:19:54,534 --> 01:19:56,695
No, don't lie.
You don't have to lie.

1085
01:19:56,836 --> 01:19:59,964
Just, omit certain details.

1086
01:20:00,707 --> 01:20:02,368
Sure. All right.

1087
01:20:04,744 --> 01:20:06,769
You know, there's something
else I was gonna ask you.

1088
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:07,847
Something else.

1089
01:20:07,948 --> 01:20:09,973
You don't have to answer
if you don't want.

1090
01:20:12,219 --> 01:20:14,710
Blue Magic. Anything?

1091
01:20:16,523 --> 01:20:21,324
Just a lot of sorrow, misery from guys
getting put out of work, that's all.

1092
01:20:22,429 --> 01:20:23,623
What, your guys?

1093
01:20:23,730 --> 01:20:24,788
Just guys.

1094
01:20:26,499 --> 01:20:29,297
You thinking about
where it's coming from?

1095
01:20:29,402 --> 01:20:32,064
Guys down south.
That's all I heard.

1096
01:20:32,706 --> 01:20:34,367
Cubans?
I don't know.

1097
01:20:35,508 --> 01:20:36,839
Not Mexico.

1098
01:20:37,544 --> 01:20:38,636
I don't know.

1099
01:20:39,112 --> 01:20:41,205
You're telling me, it's
coming in from South America?

1100
01:20:41,348 --> 01:20:42,872
I don't know.

1101
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:48,414
All I can tell you is whoever it is, they're
upsetting the natural order of things.

1102
01:20:48,755 --> 01:20:50,848
And that's all there is.

1103
01:21:05,872 --> 01:21:06,896
What's up?

1104
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,871
<i>My man, how we looking?</i>

1105
01:22:39,178 --> 01:22:41,646
Frank, I want you to
meet Mike Sobota.

1106
01:22:42,081 --> 01:22:43,378
How are you doing, Mr. Sobota?
How are you?

1107
01:22:43,516 --> 01:22:44,505
What can I get you?

1108
01:22:44,650 --> 01:22:46,675
How about a left-hander? From
what Charlie tells me, your nephew.

1109
01:22:46,819 --> 01:22:50,050
Oh, this is the... Yankees,
yeah. Hey, Steve! Yankees.

1110
01:22:50,189 --> 01:22:51,622
Steve! Come here.
Excuse me one second.

1111
01:22:51,724 --> 01:22:53,589
This boy's good, okay? I want
you to put him on the Yankees.

1112
01:22:53,693 --> 01:22:54,751
'Cause you good enough,
ain't you?

1113
01:22:54,861 --> 01:22:56,988
I'm a Lucas. Good enough
on a bad day, Jack.

1114
01:22:57,096 --> 01:22:58,859
He's good enough on a bad day,
so don't make it a bad day,

1115
01:22:58,998 --> 01:23:00,397
make it a good day,
you understand?

1116
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:04,834
NYPD, excuse me, Police
Department. Back up, baby.

1117
01:23:04,937 --> 01:23:07,963
Whoa!Hey! Hey! Hey!

1118
01:23:08,074 --> 01:23:09,837
Taking your ass in, Jimmy.
Uh-uh.

1119
01:23:09,942 --> 01:23:12,137
Taking your ass in.
Where are the handcuffs?

1120
01:23:12,245 --> 01:23:14,236
I got a license for
that, motherfucker.

1121
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:17,508
You got a license for this?
Excuse me, all right?

1122
01:23:19,619 --> 01:23:21,644
Shit. All right! Yeah!

1123
01:23:21,921 --> 01:23:23,548
Now, you know what? I gotta
arrest you for that shit.

1124
01:23:23,689 --> 01:23:24,849
That shit's too good
to be on the street.

1125
01:23:24,957 --> 01:23:28,723
Wait a minute, I got this for you.
You ain't got to arrest nobody.

1126
01:23:28,861 --> 01:23:30,522
Are you bribing me now?

1127
01:23:30,630 --> 01:23:33,224
I'll tell you what,
I'm arresting everybody!

1128
01:23:33,366 --> 01:23:35,163
Now, all you're
under arrest! You first!

1129
01:23:35,268 --> 01:23:36,826
That's my family.
That's my...

1130
01:23:36,936 --> 01:23:37,994
Excuse me, excuse me.

1131
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:42,201
Back it up, baby.

1132
01:23:42,308 --> 01:23:43,366
What was that?

1133
01:23:43,476 --> 01:23:45,171
Come on, guys. What's
the matter with you, man?

1134
01:23:45,278 --> 01:23:46,836
I said, what the hell
was that? What was what?

1135
01:23:46,946 --> 01:23:48,538
I said what the hell are
you doing, man? Be cool, man!

1136
01:23:48,648 --> 01:23:49,842
What's your fucking problem?

1137
01:23:49,949 --> 01:23:51,678
What the hell's
wrong with you?

1138
01:23:51,784 --> 01:23:53,581
Goddamn!

1139
01:23:54,387 --> 01:23:56,878
He's all right. I just
shot him in the leg, is all.

1140
01:23:56,989 --> 01:23:58,786
Damn, Jimmy!

1141
01:23:59,659 --> 01:24:00,853
Get up.

1142
01:24:14,574 --> 01:24:17,407
All right, everybody,
get out! Get out!

1143
01:24:18,477 --> 01:24:19,967
Come on, Frank,
it was an accident.

1144
01:24:20,112 --> 01:24:21,773
It wasn't no goddamn
accident. He feels terrible.

1145
01:24:21,914 --> 01:24:25,281
He don't feel shit, 'cause he's
coked up all the motherfucking time!

1146
01:24:25,418 --> 01:24:27,409
He's your driver.
Get rid of him.

1147
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,487
Come on, man,
that's your cousin!

1148
01:24:28,588 --> 01:24:29,577
That ain't shit to me!

1149
01:24:29,689 --> 01:24:30,713
He don't mean nothing to me.

1150
01:24:30,823 --> 01:24:31,755
What's he gonna do,
go back home?

1151
01:24:31,857 --> 01:24:33,381
I don't give a damn
what he does!

1152
01:24:33,492 --> 01:24:35,551
Send his ass home!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1153
01:24:35,661 --> 01:24:37,629
Hey! Don't rub on that!
You blot that!

1154
01:24:37,763 --> 01:24:39,128
You understand?
That's alpaca!

1155
01:24:39,265 --> 01:24:42,723
That's $25,000 alpaca!
You blot that shit!

1156
01:24:42,835 --> 01:24:45,065
You don't rub it!
Put the club soda on there.

1157
01:24:45,171 --> 01:24:47,105
Simple Simon-ass
motherfuckers.

1158
01:24:47,206 --> 01:24:50,403
Listen, from now on, don't nobody
talk to me directly! You understand?

1159
01:24:50,509 --> 01:24:54,138
You got business with me, you talk to
Huey! Huey, you talk to me! You got it?

1160
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,269
All right.

1161
01:24:55,381 --> 01:24:56,746
Damn it, never on the phone!
You got it?

1162
01:24:56,849 --> 01:24:58,077
I got it.
All right!

1163
01:24:58,184 --> 01:25:00,584
And take them goddamn
sunglasses off.

1164
01:25:00,686 --> 01:25:02,244
Take the goddamn
sunglasses off!

1165
01:25:02,355 --> 01:25:03,913
Damn it, man.

1166
01:25:06,158 --> 01:25:08,524
Simple Simon-ass
motherfuckers.

1167
01:25:24,043 --> 01:25:26,477
The whole place was imported.

1168
01:25:27,046 --> 01:25:28,673
Brick by brick.

1169
01:25:29,815 --> 01:25:30,839
Gloucestershire.

1170
01:25:31,984 --> 01:25:34,145
Who?
Great Britain.

1171
01:25:34,754 --> 01:25:36,119
Yours.

1172
01:25:41,093 --> 01:25:42,651
Here you go.

1173
01:25:47,066 --> 01:25:48,055
Pull!

1174
01:25:53,706 --> 01:25:55,367
Come, Eva.

1175
01:25:56,242 --> 01:25:59,234
I'm sure you're dying
to see the rest of the house.

1176
01:26:03,015 --> 01:26:05,506
Of course. Excuse me.

1177
01:26:06,752 --> 01:26:09,687
Thank you for a wonderful
lunch. It was delicious.

1178
01:26:13,526 --> 01:26:15,653
What do you think
of monopolies?

1179
01:26:17,063 --> 01:26:18,223
You mean like the game?

1180
01:26:18,364 --> 01:26:21,993
No, I just think monopolies were
made illegal in the country, Frank,

1181
01:26:22,101 --> 01:26:24,331
'cause nobody wants
to compete, you know.

1182
01:26:24,437 --> 01:26:27,429
Nobody wants to compete,
not with a monopoly.

1183
01:26:27,573 --> 01:26:30,167
I mean, you let the
dairy farmers do that,

1184
01:26:30,276 --> 01:26:32,267
half of them would be
out of business tomorrow.

1185
01:26:32,411 --> 01:26:33,878
Just trying to make a living.

1186
01:26:33,979 --> 01:26:35,674
That's your right, I mean,

1187
01:26:35,881 --> 01:26:38,543
it's everyone's right.
It's America.

1188
01:26:38,918 --> 01:26:43,082
We just can't do it at the
unreasonable expense of others.

1189
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:45,549
'Cause then it becomes
un-American.

1190
01:26:45,658 --> 01:26:47,592
That's why the price
we pay for that gallon of milk

1191
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,523
could never represent
the true cost of production

1192
01:26:49,628 --> 01:26:54,122
'cause it's got to be controlled.
It's gotta be set. It's gotta be fair.

1193
01:26:54,233 --> 01:26:56,724
Gotta be controlled by who? I
set a price that I think is fair.

1194
01:26:56,836 --> 01:26:58,133
I don't think it's fair.
You don't?

1195
01:26:58,237 --> 01:26:59,704
I don't think it's fair.
I think it's fair.

1196
01:26:59,805 --> 01:27:01,773
I mean, I know your
customers are happy, Frank,

1197
01:27:01,907 --> 01:27:04,603
bunch of fucking
junkies that they are.

1198
01:27:04,744 --> 01:27:09,238
But we fellow dairy farmers out
here, Frank, are you thinking of us?

1199
01:27:09,949 --> 01:27:11,473
You thinking of them?

1200
01:27:11,817 --> 01:27:13,478
The dairy farmers?
Yeah.

1201
01:27:13,953 --> 01:27:18,720
I'm thinking of them, Dominic, about as
much as they've ever thought about me.

1202
01:27:18,824 --> 01:27:21,156
I'm just thinking
out loud now.

1203
01:27:21,660 --> 01:27:24,151
If you took some
of your inventory, Frank,

1204
01:27:24,463 --> 01:27:26,795
and you sold it wholesale...

1205
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,194
Sit.

1206
01:27:30,069 --> 01:27:33,561
We could work.
We could do some distribution.

1207
01:27:34,774 --> 01:27:36,002
I don't know.
I'm pretty good, Dominic.

1208
01:27:36,108 --> 01:27:40,044
You know, I got 110th, 155th,
river to river. I'm all right.

1209
01:27:40,146 --> 01:27:43,081
That's kind of a mom and pop store
next to what I'm talking about.

1210
01:27:43,182 --> 01:27:44,809
I mean, let's go at
least bigger than Kmart.

1211
01:27:44,917 --> 01:27:49,820
I'm talking about LA, Chicago, Detroit,
Las Vegas. Let's go nationwide, huh?

1212
01:27:50,289 --> 01:27:54,658
I'm gonna guarantee you your peace
of mind here. You don't want that?

1213
01:27:56,045 --> 01:27:57,706
You're going to need it.

1214
01:27:58,347 --> 01:27:59,974
I don't know how
you view me, you know.

1215
01:28:00,083 --> 01:28:01,914
I'm kind of a
Renaissance man, Frank.

1216
01:28:02,051 --> 01:28:04,042
You know, the people I
deal with on a daily basis,

1217
01:28:04,187 --> 01:28:05,984
you know, they're not
enlightened, Frank.

1218
01:28:06,089 --> 01:28:08,853
You talk to them about civil
rights, they don't know, you know.

1219
01:28:08,958 --> 01:28:09,982
They're not open to change.

1220
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:14,252
Not from the way things
are done and who's doing it.

1221
01:28:14,397 --> 01:28:17,730
I talk to them, there's
just no misunderstandings.

1222
01:28:19,102 --> 01:28:22,094
And that's what I mean
by your peace of mind.

1223
01:28:26,776 --> 01:28:29,939
You're paying, what,
$75,000, $80,000 a kilo?

1224
01:28:32,115 --> 01:28:34,242
I'm a Renaissance man, too.

1225
01:28:35,418 --> 01:28:37,045
I'll consider $50,000.

1226
01:28:45,995 --> 01:28:49,226
Why would you trust these people?
And the way they look at you...

1227
01:28:49,332 --> 01:28:51,698
They look at me like it's
Christmas and I'm Santa Claus.

1228
01:28:51,801 --> 01:28:54,463
They look at us
like we're the help.

1229
01:28:55,138 --> 01:28:56,969
They work for me now.

1230
01:29:01,978 --> 01:29:02,276
<i>I predict that when
I meet Joe Frazier,</i>

1231
01:29:02,311 --> 01:29:04,279
<i>I predict that when
I meet Joe Frazier,</i>

1232
01:29:04,413 --> 01:29:08,713
<i>this will be like a good amateur
fighting a real professional.</i>

1233
01:29:08,818 --> 01:29:11,286
<i>This will be like a kid
out of the Olympics...</i>

1234
01:29:11,420 --> 01:29:13,786
That's gonna be
Ali in like three.

1235
01:29:13,923 --> 01:29:16,153
<i>You're not fighting
Oscar Bonavena,</i>

1236
01:29:16,292 --> 01:29:17,384
<i>you're not fighting
Sonny Liston.</i>

1237
01:29:17,493 --> 01:29:18,517
<i>You're fighting Joe Frazier.</i>

1238
01:29:18,628 --> 01:29:20,255
<i>Everybody knows that.
That's not the point.</i>

1239
01:29:20,363 --> 01:29:21,694
He's all talk, man.

1240
01:29:21,797 --> 01:29:24,061
Look at Frazier! Ali
gonna crush him, baby.

1241
01:29:24,167 --> 01:29:25,156
<i>I'll stop him.</i>

1242
01:29:25,268 --> 01:29:26,565
<i>Stop me? You?</i>

1243
01:29:26,669 --> 01:29:27,931
<i>How soon? What round?</i>

1244
01:29:28,037 --> 01:29:31,564
<i>Don't let him obligate you. One to 10!</i>

1245
01:29:31,674 --> 01:29:36,509
<i>Tonight, March 8, 1971. Here
we are at Madison Square Garden</i>

1246
01:29:36,646 --> 01:29:38,113
<i>for the Fight of the Century.</i>

1247
01:29:38,214 --> 01:29:41,411
<i>And by anybody's definition,
this is a happening.</i>

1248
01:29:41,517 --> 01:29:45,954
<i>There are handshakes and, of course,
there are utterly beautiful women.</i>

1249
01:29:46,055 --> 01:29:48,216
<i>But behind the smiles
and behind the handshakes,</i>

1250
01:29:48,324 --> 01:29:52,624
<i>you can feel the atmosphere is so heavy
with tension, it's almost unbearable.</i>

1251
01:29:53,396 --> 01:29:55,660
<i>Everybody who is
anybody is here.</i>

1252
01:29:55,798 --> 01:29:59,495
<i>Like Sinatra. Like Graziano,
David Frost and Diahann Carroll.</i>

1253
01:29:59,735 --> 01:30:03,535
<i>And Woody Allen and Diane Keaton.
The celebrities are pouring in.</i>

1254
01:30:03,673 --> 01:30:07,769
<i>The way you all build it up, Life
magazine cover, Time magazine,</i>

1255
01:30:07,877 --> 01:30:11,870
<i>everybody gives their opinion.
Dempsey says I'll lose. Joe Louis...</i>

1256
01:30:12,014 --> 01:30:15,381
<i>And when Joe Louis said I'm gonna lose,
that's how I knew I'd won this one.</i>

1257
01:30:15,518 --> 01:30:18,487
<i>Joe Louis always picks
the wrong man!</i>

1258
01:30:18,588 --> 01:30:20,681
<i>Always picks the wrong man.</i>

1259
01:30:20,823 --> 01:30:23,724
<i>Joe Louis is here
tonight. Watch your ass.</i>

1260
01:30:23,859 --> 01:30:27,226
<i>The official weight of
Joe Frazier is 205.5 pounds.</i>

1261
01:30:27,897 --> 01:30:29,023
Oh.

1262
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,901
<i>Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.</i>

1263
01:30:34,237 --> 01:30:36,364
You're not watching
the fight, Bob?

1264
01:30:36,505 --> 01:30:38,370
I'm not into boxing.

1265
01:30:39,208 --> 01:30:41,506
This ain't
boxing, kid.

1266
01:30:41,611 --> 01:30:43,306
It's politics.

1267
01:30:46,682 --> 01:30:48,309
I got something for you, too.

1268
01:30:48,417 --> 01:30:49,884
Yeah?

1269
01:30:52,521 --> 01:30:54,989
The coat? For me?
Mmm-hmm.

1270
01:30:55,958 --> 01:30:57,653
Do you like it?

1271
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:00,228
The coat? Yeah,
yeah, it's nice.

1272
01:31:03,065 --> 01:31:04,862
What do you think?
Yeah.

1273
01:31:04,967 --> 01:31:06,730
You sure?
Yeah.

1274
01:31:14,310 --> 01:31:15,868
Over here, Sammy.

1275
01:31:15,978 --> 01:31:18,378
Hey, Sammy! Give a look.

1276
01:31:20,449 --> 01:31:21,882
Joe Louis! Over here!

1277
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:23,315
How's it going, Frank?

1278
01:31:23,419 --> 01:31:24,943
How are you, Joe?

1279
01:31:34,163 --> 01:31:35,391
<i>Now,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1280
01:31:35,498 --> 01:31:38,934
<i>we have quite a
list of introductions.</i>

1281
01:31:39,068 --> 01:31:44,370
<i>We are now going to introduce
people from all endeavors of life.</i>

1282
01:31:44,907 --> 01:31:46,966
<i>And not just show people.</i>

1283
01:31:47,109 --> 01:31:50,135
<i>Because everyone
is here tonight!</i>

1284
01:32:02,291 --> 01:32:03,918
<i>Main event!</i>

1285
01:32:06,095 --> 01:32:07,926
<i>Fifteen rounds.</i>

1286
01:32:08,030 --> 01:32:13,058
<i>For the undisputed Heavyweight
Championship of the World!</i>

1287
01:32:13,169 --> 01:32:14,227
There we go, Ali!

1288
01:32:14,337 --> 01:32:17,898
<i>From Louisville, Kentucky,
he's wearing red trunks.</i>

1289
01:32:18,007 --> 01:32:19,372
Champ! This is Frank Lucas.

1290
01:32:19,475 --> 01:32:21,409
<i>He weighs 215 pounds.</i>

1291
01:32:22,611 --> 01:32:26,274
<i>Here is Muhammad Ali!</i>

1292
01:32:27,550 --> 01:32:31,577
<i>His opponent, from
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,</i>

1293
01:32:32,054 --> 01:32:34,318
<i>he's wearing green trunks.</i>

1294
01:32:34,724 --> 01:32:36,783
Who's that laughing
with Cattano?

1295
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:39,553
How'd he get so
fucking close to the ring?

1296
01:32:39,662 --> 01:32:42,756
<i>The Heavyweight Champion
of the World,</i>

1297
01:32:42,865 --> 01:32:45,800
<i>Joe Frazier!</i>

1298
01:32:48,137 --> 01:32:51,504
Hey, Frank. You gonna
keep that hat on all night?

1299
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:52,664
I'm gonna miss the fight.

1300
01:32:52,775 --> 01:32:54,504
You paid for it.

1301
01:33:39,755 --> 01:33:41,746
<i>This guy, he's a supplier
at most. Or just a pimp.</i>

1302
01:33:41,857 --> 01:33:42,915
<i>Otherwise we'd know his name.</i>

1303
01:33:43,025 --> 01:33:46,859
His tickets were phenomenal. Better
seats than Dominic Cattano. Right?

1304
01:33:47,496 --> 01:33:49,521
Joe Louis shook his hand.

1305
01:33:50,533 --> 01:33:52,558
Who the fuck is this guy?

1306
01:33:56,372 --> 01:33:57,737
What's this?

1307
01:33:57,873 --> 01:34:00,068
That's the plate off the limo.

1308
01:34:00,209 --> 01:34:02,143
Check with the company
who rented it.

1309
01:34:05,681 --> 01:34:08,741
Right there, Mr. Lucas.
Right there. Good.

1310
01:34:10,186 --> 01:34:12,654
Can I get a shot here, Frank?
Right here.

1311
01:34:12,755 --> 01:34:14,188
Looking good, Frank.

1312
01:34:15,024 --> 01:34:16,013
Beautiful.

1313
01:34:18,027 --> 01:34:19,426
Right on, Frank!

1314
01:34:19,528 --> 01:34:21,223
Congratulations!

1315
01:34:27,136 --> 01:34:29,001
She's the most beautiful
bride I've ever seen.

1316
01:34:29,104 --> 01:34:31,368
That's my sunshine
right there, Mr. Williams.

1317
01:34:31,474 --> 01:34:32,702
I wish Bumpy had met her.

1318
01:34:32,808 --> 01:34:33,832
Throw it to me!

1319
01:34:39,215 --> 01:34:40,705
Get a picture.

1320
01:34:50,559 --> 01:34:52,186
Come here, baby.

1321
01:35:16,919 --> 01:35:19,581
What's happening?
Sit tight.

1322
01:35:20,756 --> 01:35:22,951
Congratulations, Frank.

1323
01:35:23,092 --> 01:35:24,252
Detective.

1324
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:27,625
So, you sure you done the right thing?
I mean, she's beautiful girl and all...

1325
01:35:27,863 --> 01:35:29,990
Hey, hey, listen, listen.

1326
01:35:30,966 --> 01:35:32,991
Before you say anything
about me or about my wife,

1327
01:35:33,135 --> 01:35:35,626
understand this is the most
important day of my life, Detective.

1328
01:35:35,771 --> 01:35:37,261
Oh, I understand.
I understand.

1329
01:35:37,373 --> 01:35:39,807
You know, a man who walks around
in a $50,000 chinchilla coat

1330
01:35:39,942 --> 01:35:42,137
and never even bought
me a cup of coffee.

1331
01:35:42,278 --> 01:35:45,441
There's something wrong there.
Pay your bills, Frank?

1332
01:35:46,849 --> 01:35:47,941
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1333
01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:49,074
Do you pay your bills,
I asked you?

1334
01:35:49,184 --> 01:35:50,412
If you're not getting
your share,

1335
01:35:50,519 --> 01:35:51,884
maybe you need to talk
to the Chief of Police.

1336
01:35:51,987 --> 01:35:55,252
What's my share? 'Cause you
don't even fucking know me.

1337
01:35:56,158 --> 01:35:57,420
Maybe I'm special.

1338
01:35:57,526 --> 01:35:59,357
You are special.

1339
01:35:59,495 --> 01:36:01,122
You see
that right there?

1340
01:36:01,230 --> 01:36:03,494
Special Investigations Unit.

1341
01:36:04,733 --> 01:36:05,995
Special.

1342
01:36:06,869 --> 01:36:08,097
Get it?

1343
01:36:08,904 --> 01:36:11,338
Ten grand.
First of each month.

1344
01:36:11,807 --> 01:36:13,832
Deliver it right here.

1345
01:36:13,976 --> 01:36:16,467
Are you done?
Oh, yeah, I'm done.

1346
01:36:19,481 --> 01:36:22,609
Don't forget your card.
Have a nice fucking honeymoon.

1347
01:36:22,718 --> 01:36:24,345
Let's go.

1348
01:37:23,646 --> 01:37:25,113
<i>His name is Frank Lucas.</i>

1349
01:37:25,214 --> 01:37:27,876
<i>Originally from Greensboro,
North Carolina.</i>

1350
01:37:28,317 --> 01:37:33,220
A couple of arrests years ago.
Gambling and unlicensed firearm.

1351
01:37:33,889 --> 01:37:38,258
For 15 years, he was Bumpy Johnson's
driver, bodyguard and collector.

1352
01:37:39,895 --> 01:37:41,624
He was with him when he died.

1353
01:37:41,764 --> 01:37:46,599
He's got five brothers. He's
the oldest. And a lot of cousins.

1354
01:37:47,836 --> 01:37:51,602
They all living up here now, spread
throughout the five boroughs and Jersey.

1355
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:54,070
The brothers are Dexter,

1356
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:56,371
<i>in Brooklyn. He's a dry
cleaner. What can I do for you?</i>

1357
01:37:56,478 --> 01:37:59,140
<i>I'm picking up.
Yeah.</i>

1358
01:37:59,281 --> 01:38:01,306
<i>Melvin in Queens
has got a custom furniture</i>

1359
01:38:01,450 --> 01:38:03,247
<i>and fire doors business.</i>

1360
01:38:04,687 --> 01:38:05,813
That's it right here?
Right there.

1361
01:38:05,954 --> 01:38:09,151
<i>Terrence in Newark,
he has a hardware store.</i>

1362
01:38:10,092 --> 01:38:12,652
<i>Turner in the Bronx
has got a tire shop.</i>

1363
01:38:14,296 --> 01:38:17,094
<i>And Huey Lucas in
Bergen County has a body shop.</i>

1364
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:18,962
Is your manager here?
That's my price.

1365
01:38:19,101 --> 01:38:20,659
Oh, man, I'm gonna take it
somewhere else, all right?

1366
01:38:20,803 --> 01:38:23,897
<i>These businesses are the
distribution and collection points</i>

1367
01:38:24,006 --> 01:38:26,566
<i>for Frank's dope
and Frank's money.</i>

1368
01:38:27,142 --> 01:38:29,667
Everything about
Frank's life seems

1369
01:38:29,812 --> 01:38:32,406
unpretentious,
orderly and legitimate.

1370
01:38:33,348 --> 01:38:35,316
<i>He starts early,
gets up at 5:00 a. m.</i>

1371
01:38:35,951 --> 01:38:39,751
<i>Has breakfast in a diner in Harlem
every morning, usually by himself.</i>

1372
01:38:39,855 --> 01:38:44,451
<i>Then he starts work. Takes a meeting
with the accountant or with his lawyer.</i>

1373
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:47,791
<i>At nights, he usually stays
at home. And if he does go out,</i>

1374
01:38:47,896 --> 01:38:51,923
<i>it's to one of two clubs or a handful
of restaurants with his new wife.</i>

1375
01:38:52,034 --> 01:38:53,865
<i>Some ball players. That's
fucking Wilt Chamberlain.</i>

1376
01:38:54,002 --> 01:38:58,302
<i>Friends, musicians. Never,
never with organized crime guys.</i>

1377
01:38:58,407 --> 01:39:01,171
<i>Sundays, he takes
his mother to church.</i>

1378
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:03,200
<i>Then he drives out
and he changes</i>

1379
01:39:03,345 --> 01:39:07,338
the flowers on Bumpy's grave.
Every Sunday, no matter what.

1380
01:39:08,217 --> 01:39:11,015
<i>Not the typical day in the
life of a dope man, Richie.</i>

1381
01:39:11,153 --> 01:39:12,211
<i>No.</i>

1382
01:39:12,354 --> 01:39:16,154
<i>Bumpy Johnson's life wasn't typical
either, and he ran Harlem for years.</i>

1383
01:39:16,291 --> 01:39:19,818
<i>So you're saying that Frank
Lucas replaced Bumpy Johnson?</i>

1384
01:39:19,962 --> 01:39:21,327
<i>Yeah.
His driver?</i>

1385
01:39:21,463 --> 01:39:23,988
<i>Sounds RICHIE: Yeah.
a little farfetched.</i>

1386
01:39:24,133 --> 01:39:26,658
<i>But is it? Is it?
Because everything he does...</i>

1387
01:39:26,802 --> 01:39:28,497
He's handing
out turkeys, man.

1388
01:39:28,637 --> 01:39:30,434
<i>he does the same as
Bumpy would have done, right?</i>

1389
01:39:30,539 --> 01:39:33,633
And who was Bumpy
most likely to teach?

1390
01:39:33,742 --> 01:39:35,801
The guy he sees every day.

1391
01:39:35,911 --> 01:39:38,209
<i>It's like a Sicilian family.</i>

1392
01:39:38,347 --> 01:39:42,408
He's structured his organization
to protect him in the same way.

1393
01:39:42,518 --> 01:39:43,917
And if he was with Bumpy
for so long,

1394
01:39:44,019 --> 01:39:46,613
that means he would have spent
a lot of time with Italians.

1395
01:39:46,722 --> 01:39:49,520
Definitely long enough
to learn that much.

1396
01:39:49,658 --> 01:39:53,059
But here's the thing. I don't think
it's Frank Lucas that we're after.

1397
01:39:54,062 --> 01:39:55,552
Who we want is whoever
Frank Lucas is working for.

1398
01:39:58,199 --> 01:39:58,790
It's whoever's actually
bringing the heroin in.

1399
01:39:58,900 --> 01:40:01,892
Okay. So what do
you have on him

1400
01:40:04,672 --> 01:40:05,468
that will stick in court?
Because this isn't it.

1401
01:40:06,941 --> 01:40:10,775
Without powder, without
informants, no one's going to jail.

1402
01:40:11,279 --> 01:40:12,439
That's understood, sir.

1403
01:40:12,547 --> 01:40:15,948
And I don't think we're gonna get
informants, not from inside the family,

1404
01:40:16,050 --> 01:40:18,814
you know, unless we
get very, very lucky.

1405
01:40:22,624 --> 01:40:24,922
Straight up lab
tests suggesting

1406
01:40:25,093 --> 01:40:27,425
purity's consistent
with Asian dope.

1407
01:40:28,429 --> 01:40:31,489
The Italians, we know, usually
work with other Europeans

1408
01:40:31,599 --> 01:40:33,533
or with the Turks.

1409
01:40:34,369 --> 01:40:36,894
We got small blue
packets turning up

1410
01:40:37,071 --> 01:40:39,631
in neighborhoods all
over the Tri-State area.

1411
01:40:40,074 --> 01:40:42,474
From Chinatown, to Harlem,
Washington Heights,

1412
01:40:42,577 --> 01:40:44,738
Richmond Avenue
and Staten Island.

1413
01:40:44,846 --> 01:40:47,644
They got North Orange,
Princeton, Bayonne, Newark,

1414
01:40:48,650 --> 01:40:52,279
Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo, and
all the way through Connecticut.

1415
01:40:52,387 --> 01:40:54,287
The same dope.

1416
01:40:57,625 --> 01:40:58,956
All right.

1417
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:04,276
That's it, down there.

1418
01:41:22,833 --> 01:41:25,961
<i>And it's Three Counts as they
round the turn for home now.</i>

1419
01:41:48,959 --> 01:41:51,154
Okay, let's all join hands.

1420
01:41:55,499 --> 01:41:58,195
Lord, we thank You for this
food we're about to receive,

1421
01:41:58,302 --> 01:42:00,236
the nourishments
of our bodies.

1422
01:42:00,337 --> 01:42:04,740
Feed our souls with heavenly grace,
in Jesus' name and for His sake.

1423
01:42:05,209 --> 01:42:06,938
Amen.
Amen.

1424
01:42:25,662 --> 01:42:27,289
Shh. Shh.

1425
01:42:27,397 --> 01:42:30,491
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.
Come on, now.

1426
01:42:32,002 --> 01:42:33,128
It's okay. Shh.

1427
01:42:34,371 --> 01:42:36,032
You better get
yourself ready, old man.

1428
01:42:36,139 --> 01:42:38,198
Come on, big man.
Throw the ball.

1429
01:42:38,342 --> 01:42:40,674
Get yourself ready,
old man. All right!

1430
01:42:41,011 --> 01:42:43,809
Come on, now. Your pop said
you had an arm on you. Come on!

1431
01:42:43,914 --> 01:42:46,439
I'm gonna set your ass
in the grass, Uncle Melvin.

1432
01:42:46,550 --> 01:42:49,110
Hey! Watch your mouth,
boy. Throw the ball!

1433
01:42:49,219 --> 01:42:52,052
Damn, Uncle Melvin, I'm a
pitcher, not an outfielder!

1434
01:42:52,189 --> 01:42:54,214
Steve. Steve, come here.

1435
01:42:55,592 --> 01:42:56,616
Come, sit down.

1436
01:42:56,727 --> 01:42:58,820
Uncle Frank.
What's happening?

1437
01:42:59,763 --> 01:43:01,128
How you doing?

1438
01:43:01,231 --> 01:43:02,220
Cool.

1439
01:43:02,366 --> 01:43:03,663
You want a drink?

1440
01:43:03,767 --> 01:43:05,291
You know better than that.

1441
01:43:05,402 --> 01:43:06,699
Just checking.

1442
01:43:09,239 --> 01:43:12,470
Why didn't you show up
for that meeting, Steve?

1443
01:43:13,243 --> 01:43:16,337
I set it up with the
Yankees and Billy Martin.

1444
01:43:18,248 --> 01:43:20,216
Why didn't you show up?

1445
01:43:22,619 --> 01:43:24,246
Don't lie to me.

1446
01:43:24,855 --> 01:43:27,346
I don't want to
play ball no more.

1447
01:43:27,925 --> 01:43:29,017
I decided.
What you talking about?

1448
01:43:29,126 --> 01:43:30,991
You decided? Decided what?

1449
01:43:31,361 --> 01:43:32,419
That ain't what I want.

1450
01:43:32,529 --> 01:43:34,929
What you talking about? You've been
playing since you was a little boy.

1451
01:43:35,065 --> 01:43:36,396
You were ready to go
into the pros. What you...

1452
01:43:36,533 --> 01:43:38,831
Frank! We got a problem, man.

1453
01:43:42,205 --> 01:43:43,866
What do you want?

1454
01:43:45,375 --> 01:43:47,866
I want what you got,
Uncle Frank.

1455
01:43:47,978 --> 01:43:49,673
I want to be you.

1456
01:44:09,283 --> 01:44:10,944
He's been diluting
it so much.

1457
01:44:11,051 --> 01:44:12,712
We're down
2%, 3% pure.

1458
01:44:12,820 --> 01:44:15,311
And you tested it?
You're sure?

1459
01:44:15,422 --> 01:44:16,389
Yeah.

1460
01:44:21,495 --> 01:44:22,484
Fuck you looking at?

1461
01:45:15,132 --> 01:45:16,326
My man.

1462
01:45:16,834 --> 01:45:18,699
Welcome, Frank.
How you doing, Nick?

1463
01:45:21,488 --> 01:45:23,217
How you doing, Nick?
It's all great. Welcome.

1464
01:45:23,457 --> 01:45:25,482
I need to talk to you.
Great. Come on.

1465
01:45:25,592 --> 01:45:27,856
Hey, you all, everybody
get out! Let's go.

1466
01:45:28,028 --> 01:45:29,052
Come on! Hurry up!

1467
01:45:31,832 --> 01:45:34,198
Sit, my brother.

1468
01:45:35,669 --> 01:45:37,864
I take it you
talked to Charlie.

1469
01:45:39,039 --> 01:45:41,439
Guess you wanna hear more
about my Black coalition.

1470
01:45:41,542 --> 01:45:43,066
Let me explain to you...
No, no, no.

1471
01:45:43,177 --> 01:45:44,576
I'm all right.

1472
01:45:44,745 --> 01:45:46,110
That's not what I
came here for, Nick.

1473
01:45:47,481 --> 01:45:48,948
Yeah, everybody's
good, Nick.

1474
01:45:49,049 --> 01:45:52,075
You know, everybody's happy.
Charlie, Baz, the Italians,

1475
01:45:52,186 --> 01:45:54,245
you know, Johnny Law.
Everybody's happy except you.

1476
01:45:54,354 --> 01:45:55,548
I'm happy, Frank.

1477
01:45:55,722 --> 01:45:56,916
You happy? Really?

1478
01:45:57,024 --> 01:45:58,651
Well, maybe I'm the
one with the problem.

1479
01:45:58,825 --> 01:46:00,486
Yeah, go on. Get one.

1480
01:46:00,594 --> 01:46:01,652
All right.

1481
01:46:02,029 --> 01:46:03,018
I gotta problem 'cause

1482
01:46:03,130 --> 01:46:05,291
I don't understand
why you gotta take

1483
01:46:05,399 --> 01:46:07,492
something that's
perfectly good

1484
01:46:07,601 --> 01:46:09,296
and mess it up.

1485
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:10,662
See, brand names.

1486
01:46:10,771 --> 01:46:11,863
Brand names mean something.
Understand?

1487
01:46:13,140 --> 01:46:14,801
Shut the fuck up!

1488
01:46:15,776 --> 01:46:17,334
Go ahead, Frank.

1489
01:46:17,444 --> 01:46:18,911
I'm sorry about
that bullshit.

1490
01:46:19,046 --> 01:46:20,411
Blue Magic.

1491
01:46:21,081 --> 01:46:22,708
That's a brand name.

1492
01:46:22,883 --> 01:46:24,578
Like Pepsi,
that's a brand name.

1493
01:46:24,718 --> 01:46:27,414
I stand behind it.
I guarantee it.

1494
01:46:27,554 --> 01:46:29,681
They know that, even if they
don't know me any more than

1495
01:46:29,790 --> 01:46:32,350
they know the chairman
of General Mills.

1496
01:46:32,459 --> 01:46:33,756
What the fuck are you
talking about, Frank?

1497
01:46:33,860 --> 01:46:36,693
What I'm talking about is
when you chop my dope down

1498
01:46:36,797 --> 01:46:39,027
to one, two, three,
four, five percent

1499
01:46:39,199 --> 01:46:41,463
and then you
call it Blue Magic,

1500
01:46:41,568 --> 01:46:43,058
that is
trademark infringement.

1501
01:46:43,237 --> 01:46:44,727
You understand
what I'm saying?

1502
01:46:44,838 --> 01:46:47,329
With all due respect, Frank,
if I buy something, I own it.

1503
01:46:47,441 --> 01:46:48,703
No, that ain't true.
That ain't true.

1504
01:46:48,809 --> 01:46:51,039
If I buy a car, and I wanna paint
it, I can paint the motherfucker.

1505
01:46:51,144 --> 01:46:52,270
Yeah, but you
don't have to.

1506
01:46:52,379 --> 01:46:53,869
This is what I'm saying to
you, Nick, you don't have to.

1507
01:46:53,981 --> 01:46:55,414
Good enough the way it is.

1508
01:46:55,515 --> 01:46:56,914
You can make
enough money off it

1509
01:46:57,017 --> 01:46:58,314
the way it is, just by
calling it Blue Magic.

1510
01:46:58,418 --> 01:47:00,249
Anything more than
that is greed, son.

1511
01:47:00,354 --> 01:47:02,254
What you want, Frank? You want
me to change the name on it?

1512
01:47:02,356 --> 01:47:04,347
I would have to insist
that you change the name.

1513
01:47:04,458 --> 01:47:06,358
Fine by me, Frank.
I'll call it Red Magic,

1514
01:47:06,460 --> 01:47:08,325
even though that
don't sound as good.

1515
01:47:08,428 --> 01:47:09,827
I don't give a fuck
what you call it.

1516
01:47:09,930 --> 01:47:11,295
Put a chokehold
on the motherfucker

1517
01:47:11,398 --> 01:47:14,026
and call it Blue Dog Shit,
you know what I mean?

1518
01:47:14,134 --> 01:47:18,366
I don't care, just don't let
me catch you doing this again.

1519
01:47:18,472 --> 01:47:21,134
Catch me? Infringement? Insist?

1520
01:47:21,241 --> 01:47:23,038
I don't like these
words as much as,

1521
01:47:23,143 --> 01:47:25,873
"Please, thank you, I'm
sorry to bother you, Nicky. "

1522
01:47:25,979 --> 01:47:28,106
These are better words you use
to come to my motherfucking club

1523
01:47:28,215 --> 01:47:30,775
without an invitation!
You hear me?

1524
01:47:31,785 --> 01:47:33,013
My man.

1525
01:47:41,628 --> 01:47:43,823
Oh, shit. Fuck, is that
the cops there, man?

1526
01:47:53,890 --> 01:47:55,482
It's all right.

1527
01:47:56,592 --> 01:47:59,083
The hell they're gonna do,
give us a ticket?

1528
01:47:59,595 --> 01:48:01,859
Stuff's in the car, Frank.

1529
01:48:03,766 --> 01:48:04,755
What?

1530
01:48:04,901 --> 01:48:07,028
Some of it's in the trunk.

1531
01:48:08,704 --> 01:48:10,501
How you doing, Frank? I'm
good. How you doing, Detective?

1532
01:48:10,606 --> 01:48:12,096
How was your Thanksgiving?

1533
01:48:12,241 --> 01:48:14,505
Not so good, as a matter of fact.
Why don't you get out of the car?

1534
01:48:20,149 --> 01:48:21,207
Come on, give me
the fucking keys.

1535
01:48:21,317 --> 01:48:23,182
Where's the Shelby at?
The Shelby's gone?

1536
01:48:23,286 --> 01:48:25,049
The Shelby's gone, Frank.
Stay right there.

1537
01:48:25,154 --> 01:48:27,054
Yes, sir. Right here.

1538
01:48:28,124 --> 01:48:29,716
You got anything
worth looking at in here?

1539
01:48:29,826 --> 01:48:31,555
Hey, that's
that Trupo guy.

1540
01:48:31,661 --> 01:48:33,253
Is that him?
Yeah.

1541
01:48:33,396 --> 01:48:34,886
Fucking prick.

1542
01:48:38,067 --> 01:48:40,467
Come over here a minute, Frank. Yeah.

1543
01:48:42,738 --> 01:48:43,796
What are we gonna
do about this?

1544
01:48:43,940 --> 01:48:46,306
We don't do shit about it. We close
it up, throw it back in the trunk,

1545
01:48:46,442 --> 01:48:49,036
everybody go home, have some
pumpkin pie, warm apple cider.

1546
01:48:49,145 --> 01:48:50,942
I got a better idea.

1547
01:48:52,114 --> 01:48:55,447
Or would you rather me throw you and
your brother in the fucking river?

1548
01:48:55,585 --> 01:48:58,247
Would you rather your
house blows up next time?

1549
01:49:02,825 --> 01:49:04,952
I loved that car.
I know.

1550
01:49:08,431 --> 01:49:11,491
What's he doing?
Shakedown!

1551
01:49:12,201 --> 01:49:14,328
Somebody's getting some money
for the Benevolent Fund.

1552
01:49:14,470 --> 01:49:15,459
Look at that shit.

1553
01:49:16,172 --> 01:49:17,469
Sorry, Frank.

1554
01:49:17,607 --> 01:49:19,837
It's all right.
Go and get in the car.

1555
01:49:43,232 --> 01:49:45,996
All right,
you call me back.

1556
01:49:50,123 --> 01:49:51,181
INS, IRS, FBI.

1557
01:49:51,258 --> 01:49:52,020
I can't get a damn thing
out of any of them.

1558
01:49:52,092 --> 01:49:53,457
Because they all think
you're on the take.

1559
01:49:53,627 --> 01:49:56,289
And you think they are.

1560
01:49:56,396 --> 01:49:59,331
You know, I don't think
they want this to stop.

1561
01:49:59,432 --> 01:50:01,024
I think it employs
too many people.

1562
01:50:03,803 --> 01:50:04,895
Judges, lawyers,
cops, politicians,

1563
01:50:05,071 --> 01:50:08,040
prison guards,
probation officers.

1564
01:50:08,742 --> 01:50:09,709
They stop bringing
dope into this country,

1565
01:50:09,809 --> 01:50:12,505
about 100,000 people are
going to be out of a job.

1566
01:50:15,882 --> 01:50:18,851
Spearman.

1567
01:50:18,952 --> 01:50:22,319
FBI. Here to see
Detective Roberts.

1568
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:30,623
So who took it out?
Somebody I know? My wife?

1569
01:50:31,998 --> 01:50:33,659
Come on, if somebody's
taking a contract

1570
01:50:33,767 --> 01:50:35,394
out on my life,
I'd like to know.

1571
01:50:35,502 --> 01:50:39,097
I can't say without compromising
our source. You understand?

1572
01:50:39,205 --> 01:50:41,605
No. Not when it's my life,
I don't understand.

1573
01:50:41,708 --> 01:50:43,198
If you want we can
assign someone to you.

1574
01:50:43,376 --> 01:50:44,934
FBI protection.

1575
01:50:45,845 --> 01:50:49,246
You know what? My life is
dangerous enough as it is.

1576
01:50:50,583 --> 01:50:52,414
Well, we'll let you get
back to your business.

1577
01:50:52,519 --> 01:50:54,612
Okay. Larry, Bob.

1578
01:50:54,788 --> 01:50:56,949
Thanks for visiting
The Garden State.

1579
01:50:57,057 --> 01:50:58,183
Take care.

1580
01:50:58,291 --> 01:51:00,623
Hey, what do you know
about Frank Lucas?

1581
01:51:00,727 --> 01:51:04,128
We know that you keep
calling about him.

1582
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:18,334
<i>We believe that
peace is at hand.</i>

1583
01:51:20,413 --> 01:51:24,850
<i>We believe that an
agreement is within sight.</i>

1584
01:51:27,620 --> 01:51:30,783
<i>As I said earlier...</i>

1585
01:51:35,295 --> 01:51:36,262
Yeah.

1586
01:51:37,497 --> 01:51:39,431
Hey, Joey. Hi.

1587
01:51:41,368 --> 01:51:44,201
All right.
Yeah, tomorrow. Why?

1588
01:52:04,039 --> 01:52:04,937
What the fuck
is a microwave?

1589
01:52:05,074 --> 01:52:08,407
It's a scientific force,
like atomic energy.

1590
01:52:08,544 --> 01:52:10,375
Yeah?
Yeah.

1591
01:52:10,479 --> 01:52:12,606
It rearranges the molecules.

1592
01:52:12,748 --> 01:52:15,114
Of what?
Of what? Of popcorn.

1593
01:52:18,287 --> 01:52:20,847
Of your head.
Stick it in. Go on.

1594
01:52:24,059 --> 01:52:26,084
I can get you one of those.

1595
01:52:26,228 --> 01:52:29,527
Brand new, just like this.
I'll have it delivered.

1596
01:52:29,932 --> 01:52:31,422
No, thank you.

1597
01:52:41,143 --> 01:52:43,168
Hey. Where is that?

1598
01:52:43,278 --> 01:52:45,109
Aspen. We just got back.

1599
01:52:45,814 --> 01:52:47,475
Had a great time.
You know who we met?

1600
01:52:47,583 --> 01:52:48,880
Who?

1601
01:52:49,585 --> 01:52:51,075
Burt Reynolds.

1602
01:52:51,487 --> 01:52:54,547
Yeah? Yeah?
Yeah. I'm not kidding.

1603
01:52:55,324 --> 01:52:59,260
A lot people from Hollywood go up
there now. They're buying up everything.

1604
01:52:59,361 --> 01:53:00,988
This is your place?
Mmm.

1605
01:53:01,130 --> 01:53:04,964
You know what that's worth?
Ski in, ski out. Five bedrooms.

1606
01:53:05,100 --> 01:53:07,796
Sauna. Everything.
We were guests.

1607
01:53:12,941 --> 01:53:14,568
It's your place.

1608
01:53:29,691 --> 01:53:32,182
Isn't there
something we can do,

1609
01:53:34,029 --> 01:53:36,589
about leaving
the big guy alone?

1610
01:53:36,999 --> 01:53:38,933
You know who I mean.

1611
01:53:39,034 --> 01:53:42,595
I don't report what you just said,
I can get in a lot of trouble.

1612
01:53:42,704 --> 01:53:45,673
I do report it,
then the trouble is yours.

1613
01:53:47,709 --> 01:53:50,007
I'm hoping you won't do that.

1614
01:53:50,846 --> 01:53:53,371
Richie, come on.
I'm not taping it.

1615
01:53:53,515 --> 01:53:56,348
How do you know?
Because we're friends.

1616
01:53:56,685 --> 01:53:59,119
And I'm telling you,
this is a real offer.

1617
01:53:59,221 --> 01:54:01,121
From who? Your uncle?

1618
01:54:04,827 --> 01:54:07,318
Why would you do this? Why
would you risk our friendship?

1619
01:54:07,429 --> 01:54:08,794
Because

1620
01:54:11,066 --> 01:54:13,364
I care what happens to you.

1621
01:54:15,437 --> 01:54:17,302
You shouldn't have done this.

1622
01:54:17,406 --> 01:54:20,466
I had to, I had no choice.
Neither do you. Richie!

1623
01:54:21,343 --> 01:54:25,143
You don't have a choice.
Just leave Frank Lucas alone.

1624
01:54:26,849 --> 01:54:28,282
Frank Lucas?

1625
01:54:29,518 --> 01:54:30,644
Yeah.

1626
01:54:33,322 --> 01:54:36,189
You tell Marie I had to leave.
I'm sorry.

1627
01:54:37,025 --> 01:54:38,492
Tell her why.

1628
01:55:21,403 --> 01:55:22,870
Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Talk! Talk!
Don't shoot!

1629
01:55:22,971 --> 01:55:25,269
Are you Richie Roberts?
Yes, so what?

1630
01:55:26,208 --> 01:55:28,039
You've been served. I'm sorry.

1631
01:55:42,791 --> 01:55:43,780
All right.

1632
01:55:47,796 --> 01:55:48,785
Laurie.

1633
01:55:50,933 --> 01:55:54,630
Look, I'm sorry I never gave you the
kind of life you wanted, all right.

1634
01:55:54,770 --> 01:55:57,068
I'm sorry it was never enough.

1635
01:56:00,175 --> 01:56:02,803
Don't punish me
for being honest.

1636
01:56:02,945 --> 01:56:04,913
Don't take my boy away.

1637
01:56:07,282 --> 01:56:10,615
What are you saying?
That because you were honest

1638
01:56:10,752 --> 01:56:13,915
and you didn't take money like
every other cop, I left you?

1639
01:56:14,022 --> 01:56:16,547
No, you don't take money
for one reason.

1640
01:56:16,658 --> 01:56:19,456
To buy being dishonest
about everything else.

1641
01:56:19,962 --> 01:56:21,953
And that's worse than taking
money nobody gives a shit about.

1642
01:56:22,097 --> 01:56:25,066
Drug money, gambling money
nobody's gonna miss.

1643
01:56:25,467 --> 01:56:28,925
You know, I'd rather you took
it and been honest with me.

1644
01:56:29,037 --> 01:56:31,733
Or don't take it. I don't care.
But then don't go cheat on me.

1645
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:34,934
Don't cheat on your kid by never
being around. Don't go out and get laid

1646
01:56:35,043 --> 01:56:37,978
by your snitches and your
secretaries and strippers!

1647
01:56:38,113 --> 01:56:40,843
I can tell by just looking,
she's one of them.

1648
01:56:40,983 --> 01:56:41,972
You...

1649
01:56:42,284 --> 01:56:46,584
You think you're going to heaven
because you're honest, but you're not.

1650
01:56:46,989 --> 01:56:49,583
You're going to the same hell as
the crooked cops you can't stand.

1651
01:56:50,859 --> 01:56:52,417
All rise.

1652
01:56:56,832 --> 01:56:58,823
Please be seated.

1653
01:57:00,002 --> 01:57:01,697
Miss Dickerson,

1654
01:57:01,837 --> 01:57:04,328
before the court
renders its opinion,

1655
01:57:04,473 --> 01:57:07,135
is there anything else
you'd like to be heard on?

1656
01:57:07,242 --> 01:57:08,971
Yes, Your Honor.

1657
01:57:09,077 --> 01:57:12,205
Your Honor, a lot has been said
here today about how unsavory

1658
01:57:12,347 --> 01:57:16,306
Mr. Roberts' environment is for
a child. How dangerous it is.

1659
01:57:16,418 --> 01:57:20,184
We tell him to protect us. We
give him that responsibility,

1660
01:57:20,322 --> 01:57:22,847
but then say, "Oh, we don't
trust you to raise a child.

1661
01:57:22,991 --> 01:57:24,515
"We don't think
you're fit for that. "

1662
01:57:24,626 --> 01:57:26,218
I'm not.

1663
01:57:27,029 --> 01:57:28,496
You're right.

1664
01:57:29,698 --> 01:57:32,132
Being around me
is no place for a kid.

1665
01:57:32,234 --> 01:57:35,465
You take him to Vegas.
I'll come see him when I can.

1666
01:57:38,407 --> 01:57:42,036
Your Honor, I want to apologize
for wasting the court's time.

1667
01:57:53,922 --> 01:57:55,617
Doc.

1668
01:57:55,724 --> 01:57:57,123
I see them.

1669
01:57:57,225 --> 01:57:58,715
There he is.

1670
01:58:17,245 --> 01:58:18,872
The fuck is this guy doing?

1671
01:58:19,648 --> 01:58:20,979
Hey!
Champagne.

1672
01:58:21,083 --> 01:58:23,278
Merry Christmas, Detectives. For us?

1673
01:58:23,385 --> 01:58:25,216
Yeah. Enjoy that.

1674
01:58:25,587 --> 01:58:27,919
You fellas have a good time.
Mmm-hmm.

1675
01:58:29,324 --> 01:58:30,882
It's Cristal.

1676
01:58:34,730 --> 01:58:37,028
<i>South Vietnamese
troops called in air strikes</i>

1677
01:58:37,132 --> 01:58:40,067
<i>on Communist positions
inside the city.</i>

1678
01:58:41,570 --> 01:58:44,266
Paying off Johnny Law,
that's one thing.

1679
01:58:44,373 --> 01:58:45,965
There ain't no problem
with that.

1680
01:58:46,074 --> 01:58:48,770
I've been paying off the
police since I was 10 years old.

1681
01:58:48,877 --> 01:58:51,539
Put more of their kids through
college than the National Merit Award.

1682
01:58:51,680 --> 01:58:53,443
Give me one of
them round one... Yeah.

1683
01:58:53,548 --> 01:58:55,482
This is different,
though. These...

1684
01:58:55,584 --> 01:58:59,486
Special Investigative Unit. That's their
problem. They think they're special.

1685
01:58:59,588 --> 01:59:02,216
Fucking crooks.
No code of ethics.

1686
01:59:02,357 --> 01:59:03,381
What do you think?

1687
01:59:03,492 --> 01:59:05,619
Looks great. It's beautiful.

1688
01:59:05,927 --> 01:59:07,053
Good.

1689
01:59:07,662 --> 01:59:09,721
The police, that ain't the
only somebody I'm worried about.

1690
01:59:09,831 --> 01:59:12,800
I seeing cars where I ain't never
seen them before, people I don't know.

1691
01:59:12,934 --> 01:59:13,901
Yeah, me, too.

1692
01:59:14,002 --> 01:59:14,764
Ho, ho, ho.

1693
01:59:17,589 --> 01:59:18,783
Merry Christmas,
Charlie.

1694
01:59:18,890 --> 01:59:19,982
Thank you.

1695
01:59:20,091 --> 01:59:21,353
I love you.

1696
01:59:21,526 --> 01:59:22,823
I love you, too.

1697
01:59:24,329 --> 01:59:26,160
Here, take this.

1698
01:59:26,431 --> 01:59:28,126
A quick toast,
and then I'll be off.

1699
01:59:28,466 --> 01:59:30,798
<i>What happened here
was an accident of war.</i>

1700
01:59:30,969 --> 01:59:33,335
<i>Somebody made a mistake.</i>

1701
01:59:34,339 --> 01:59:36,534
Bumpy ain't hardly
ever go out no more.

1702
01:59:36,708 --> 01:59:38,938
After a certain point
he stayed in the house.

1703
01:59:41,713 --> 01:59:43,874
Watch TV.

1704
01:59:45,183 --> 01:59:47,151
Play chess.
Read the newspaper.

1705
01:59:48,820 --> 01:59:50,913
I though he was just trying
to lead the quiet life,

1706
01:59:51,022 --> 01:59:53,081
but no, he couldn't
go nowhere.

1707
01:59:53,191 --> 01:59:54,658
Not without
something happening.

1708
01:59:54,826 --> 01:59:56,316
Frankie...

1709
01:59:56,494 --> 01:59:58,086
We can still go out.

1710
01:59:58,263 --> 01:59:59,890
With who? Where?

1711
01:59:59,998 --> 02:00:01,625
Well, with...

1712
02:00:01,799 --> 02:00:03,391
But I know he's
under surveillance.

1713
02:00:04,569 --> 02:00:06,230
Ain't gonna be
no Christmas time

1714
02:00:06,404 --> 02:00:08,133
with my family
being here no more.

1715
02:00:08,239 --> 02:00:11,367
Why don't you just pay
who you have to pay?

1716
02:00:11,476 --> 02:00:13,569
I do pay them. I pay
thousands and millions

1717
02:00:13,745 --> 02:00:15,838
to dope dealers,
crooks, cops.

1718
02:00:16,314 --> 02:00:17,372
I pay everybody.

1719
02:00:17,548 --> 02:00:18,640
I pay more than
they should get.

1720
02:00:18,750 --> 02:00:20,911
I can't satisfy
nobody!

1721
02:00:21,019 --> 02:00:23,078
It's like dope! Everybody's strung out!

1722
02:00:23,187 --> 02:00:25,212
The more you give 'em,
the more they want.

1723
02:00:25,356 --> 02:00:27,654
They expect more.

1724
02:00:28,660 --> 02:00:30,855
Give more and they want more.

1725
02:00:35,566 --> 02:00:37,659
Do you want to go out?

1726
02:00:38,603 --> 02:00:40,571
All right, baby. Put
something of what you got.

1727
02:00:40,672 --> 02:00:41,866
Should I?
Yeah.

1728
02:00:41,973 --> 02:00:43,167
That's Christmas spirit.

1729
02:00:43,274 --> 02:00:45,504
<i>That's what I'm talking about.
Feliz Navidad.</i>

1730
02:00:45,610 --> 02:00:47,339
Something nice?
Mmm-hmm.

1731
02:00:55,086 --> 02:00:56,417
We're going to
have a great time.

1732
02:00:56,521 --> 02:00:57,613
<i>That's right, chica.</i>

1733
02:00:57,722 --> 02:01:00,282
Mr. Lucas.
Enjoy your evening.

1734
02:01:01,326 --> 02:01:02,884
It's all clear.

1735
02:01:07,247 --> 02:01:07,975
Nicky!

1736
02:01:08,081 --> 02:01:09,878
Who is that? There's
your boy, Nicky. See him?

1737
02:01:09,983 --> 02:01:10,972
Know what I'm saying?

1738
02:01:11,084 --> 02:01:13,678
Yeah, I see him.
Let's keep going.

1739
02:01:14,421 --> 02:01:15,479
Around back?

1740
02:01:15,589 --> 02:01:18,683
Hell, no. I ain't
sneaking into my own club.

1741
02:01:19,092 --> 02:01:21,026
Incredible.
Huh?

1742
02:01:43,283 --> 02:01:44,682
Come on.

1743
02:01:47,554 --> 02:01:48,578
Hold on. Hold on.

1744
02:01:57,030 --> 02:01:58,054
What?

1745
02:01:58,198 --> 02:01:59,995
I want to wait in the car.

1746
02:02:00,100 --> 02:02:03,160
Frank, I got it. I got it.
I'll wait for it. I got it.

1747
02:02:03,570 --> 02:02:05,595
Get that yellow sauce.
Yellow sauce.

1748
02:02:05,739 --> 02:02:07,764
And the chicken.
The Kung Pao chicken.

1749
02:02:14,047 --> 02:02:15,776
Can you turn the heater on?

1750
02:02:22,122 --> 02:02:24,283
Shit. I'm gonna go
get the keys.

1751
02:02:38,238 --> 02:02:40,763
Doc, give me the keys.
Here you go.

1752
02:02:46,513 --> 02:02:47,775
Doc!

1753
02:02:51,918 --> 02:02:53,715
Get out of the car.

1754
02:03:00,160 --> 02:03:02,094
You okay?
Yeah.

1755
02:03:02,195 --> 02:03:03,253
Shit.

1756
02:03:03,363 --> 02:03:04,455
Come on.

1757
02:03:04,598 --> 02:03:06,623
Come on, baby. You all right?

1758
02:03:07,601 --> 02:03:08,898
Let's go.

1759
02:03:29,556 --> 02:03:31,023
Was it Nicky?

1760
02:03:32,693 --> 02:03:35,025
We'll go right now and fucking
kill him whether it was him or not,

1761
02:03:35,162 --> 02:03:37,096
you say the word, Frankie.

1762
02:03:38,632 --> 02:03:40,964
We got to do something, Frank.

1763
02:03:41,401 --> 02:03:42,425
We can't just sit here.

1764
02:03:42,536 --> 02:03:44,026
We're leaving.

1765
02:03:47,174 --> 02:03:48,835
All right, everybody get out.
You all right, man?

1766
02:03:48,975 --> 02:03:51,102
Go on home. It's Christmas time.
Go and be with your families.

1767
02:03:51,211 --> 02:03:52,508
I'm all right.

1768
02:03:52,646 --> 02:03:55,547
Go on. Go ahead.
Be with your kids.

1769
02:03:55,682 --> 02:03:56,979
Go ahead.

1770
02:04:09,162 --> 02:04:10,220
Where are we gonna go, huh?

1771
02:04:10,364 --> 02:04:11,956
We're gonna go to Spain,
somewhere? China?

1772
02:04:12,065 --> 02:04:15,557
Huh? Come on, sit down.
Tell me where you want to go.

1773
02:04:16,236 --> 02:04:19,171
Frank, we can go
anywhere we want.

1774
02:04:19,272 --> 02:04:21,172
No, we can't.
We can live anywhere, Frank.

1775
02:04:21,274 --> 02:04:22,969
Where? And do what?
Run? Hide?

1776
02:04:23,076 --> 02:04:26,011
Frank Lucas don't run
from nobody, baby.

1777
02:04:26,113 --> 02:04:27,910
We ain't going nowhere.
We're gonna stay right here.

1778
02:04:28,048 --> 02:04:30,312
We're gonna stay right here.
This is my home.

1779
02:04:30,417 --> 02:04:33,716
This is where my business is,
my wife, my mother, my family.

1780
02:04:33,854 --> 02:04:36,322
My country.
I ain't going nowhere.

1781
02:04:37,023 --> 02:04:39,218
I ain't running from nobody!

1782
02:04:40,594 --> 02:04:42,221
This is America.

1783
02:04:49,035 --> 02:04:51,595
And you ain't going
nowhere, either!

1784
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:54,766
Huh?

1785
02:04:57,077 --> 02:04:59,739
<i>A ceasefire, internationally
supervised, will begin</i>

1786
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:04,180
<i>at 7:00 p. m. this Saturday,
January 27th, Washington time.</i>

1787
02:05:04,284 --> 02:05:06,309
I'll call you back.

1788
02:05:06,586 --> 02:05:08,816
Hey! What are you doing?

1789
02:05:11,024 --> 02:05:12,218
Richie.

1790
02:05:16,062 --> 02:05:17,154
Wow.

1791
02:05:19,433 --> 02:05:24,234
So, what I hear it was the
Corsican mob took a shot at Frank.

1792
02:05:24,371 --> 02:05:26,202
You know, French Connection,
Fernando Rey,

1793
02:05:26,306 --> 02:05:28,672
the exporters that
Frank has put out of business.

1794
02:05:30,076 --> 02:05:32,203
Look, I can take care
of him in New York.

1795
02:05:32,312 --> 02:05:33,779
I just don't want to have
to worry that every time

1796
02:05:33,914 --> 02:05:35,381
he drives across
the bridge to Jersey,

1797
02:05:35,482 --> 02:05:38,280
someone's gonna take
another shot at him.

1798
02:05:38,418 --> 02:05:41,683
Richie, you and I gotta
start working together.

1799
02:05:42,155 --> 02:05:44,521
We need to step up
our efforts.

1800
02:05:44,891 --> 02:05:47,553
Next time,
their aim could be better.

1801
02:05:48,161 --> 02:05:50,755
We need to keep
this cash cow alive.

1802
02:05:56,603 --> 02:05:58,798
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1803
02:05:59,306 --> 02:06:00,637
Whoa!

1804
02:06:03,844 --> 02:06:07,780
Were you actually gonna arrest Frank
Lucas? What's the matter with you?

1805
02:06:08,181 --> 02:06:10,376
What, you don't know?
No.

1806
02:06:11,084 --> 02:06:13,609
Everybody in New Jersey's crazy. Oh.

1807
02:06:14,154 --> 02:06:17,590
You know what we do here?
Cops arrest bad guys.

1808
02:06:19,826 --> 02:06:21,817
Before you get on
that bridge again,

1809
02:06:21,962 --> 02:06:25,329
you should call me first,
just make sure it's safe.

1810
02:06:28,535 --> 02:06:32,130
"I'm more enlightened than some of my
friends. I can guarantee you peace of mind. "

1811
02:06:32,272 --> 02:06:34,570
That's what you
told me, Dominic.

1812
02:06:35,842 --> 02:06:38,402
"I can guarantee you
peace of mind!"

1813
02:06:38,512 --> 02:06:40,571
I don't feel so peaceful!

1814
02:06:42,048 --> 02:06:43,174
Huh?

1815
02:06:45,619 --> 02:06:47,814
They tried to kill my wife!

1816
02:06:52,225 --> 02:06:53,783
Who was that? Huh?

1817
02:06:55,996 --> 02:06:58,362
Maybe it was one
of your peoples.

1818
02:06:58,498 --> 02:07:00,693
I don't know yet. No.
You don't know?

1819
02:07:00,834 --> 02:07:02,358
You don't know.

1820
02:07:03,737 --> 02:07:06,672
I'll tell you what I know.
Maybe I should just put 500 guns

1821
02:07:06,806 --> 02:07:08,865
out there on the street and just
start shooting up some people,

1822
02:07:08,975 --> 02:07:09,964
just to make a point.

1823
02:07:10,076 --> 02:07:13,375
Frank, it was a junkie. It
was a rival. Some dumb-ass kid

1824
02:07:13,513 --> 02:07:17,210
trying to make a name for himself.
Somebody you forgot to pay off.

1825
02:07:17,350 --> 02:07:20,285
Someone you slighted
without even realizing it.

1826
02:07:20,387 --> 02:07:24,653
Could be someone you put out of business
from being so successful. Look at you.

1827
02:07:25,492 --> 02:07:29,053
Success, it's got enemies,
Frank. Lots of enemies.

1828
02:07:30,697 --> 02:07:33,222
So your success took a shot at
you. What are you gonna do now?

1829
02:07:33,366 --> 02:07:37,029
How you gonna kill it? You're
gonna become unsuccessful?

1830
02:07:38,004 --> 02:07:40,837
Frank, we can be successful
and have enemies, right?

1831
02:07:41,241 --> 02:07:44,506
Or we can be unsuccessful, too,
you know, we can have friends.

1832
02:07:45,412 --> 02:07:47,505
That's the choice we make.

1833
02:07:48,915 --> 02:07:52,544
<i>The final evacuation of
military and diplomatic personnel</i>

1834

<i>continued throughout the night, as North
Vietnamese troops marched on Saigon.</i>

1835

02:08:24,985 --> 02:08:26,350
<i>Yeah, Nate.</i>

1839
02:08:26,453 --> 02:08:28,114
Hey, Frank. What's up, baby?

1840
02:08:28,254 --> 02:08:29,619
What's going on over there?

1841
02:08:29,723 --> 02:08:30,917
<i>It's all over.</i>

1842
02:08:31,057 --> 02:08:32,888
Yeah, I'm watching the news.
What the hell's going on?

1843
02:08:32,993 --> 02:08:34,688
<i>The game's over, Frank.</i>

1844
02:08:34,794 --> 02:08:36,125
Huh?
It's done.

1845
02:08:36,262 --> 02:08:38,230
Everybody going home, baby.
Give peace a chance.

1846
02:08:38,331 --> 02:08:39,696
<i>Well, look, I'm not...
Listen to me.</i>

1847

I want two...

1848
02:08:42,335 --> 02:08:45,133
I want 2,000
keys in the air.

02:08:45,271 --> 02:08:48,536
<i>It's impossible, Frank. All our
resources are going home. It's over.</i>

1850
02:08:48,642 --> 02:08:50,405
I'll tell you what.
I'm on my way over there.

1851
02:08:50,510 --> 02:08:52,444
<i>Right now? Oh, come...
Yeah.</i>

1852
02:08:59,819 --> 02:09:01,980
You stole my shit?

1853
02:09:02,122 --> 02:09:04,215
Spearman, wake the fuck up, man. What?

1854
02:09:06,159 --> 02:09:07,717
Where's my shit, Darlynn?

1855
02:09:07,827 --> 02:09:09,795
Don't hurt me, Jimmy!

1856
02:09:11,431 --> 02:09:13,262
Jesus! What the... Police! Police!

1857
02:09:13,366 --> 02:09:15,163
Drop the gun, Jimmy!
Drop the gun!

1858
02:09:15,301 --> 02:09:17,496
Let me see your hands!
Jimmy, drop the fucking gun!

1859
02:09:17,637 --> 02:09:20,401
I'm not playing with you, Jimmy!
I'll blast your fucking head off!

1860
02:09:20,507 --> 02:09:22,304
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1861
02:09:24,044 --> 02:09:27,138
I got your gun
and I got your prints.

1862
02:09:28,448 --> 02:09:31,645
You know what you got?
You got attempted murder.

1863
02:09:32,852 --> 02:09:34,752
Fifteen fucking years!

1864
02:09:35,155 --> 02:09:38,488
Attempted murder is the same as
Murder One, that's a grand jury.

1865
02:09:38,625 --> 02:09:40,855
Now, a grand jury could
come back favorably.

1866
02:09:40,994 --> 02:09:44,088
It could be reduced
to manslaughter.

1867
02:09:44,197 --> 02:09:46,358
All right?
Maybe even self-defense.

1868
02:09:46,499 --> 02:09:48,330
It all just depends
on how we wanna deal with you.

1869
02:09:48,468 --> 02:09:50,436
See where this is
fucking going, Jimmy?

1870
02:09:50,537 --> 02:09:53,995
Let's say you beat it. What you think
your cousin Frank is gonna think?

1871
02:09:54,140 --> 02:09:56,472
Right, he is gonna know,
at some point in time,

1872
02:09:56,576 --> 02:09:59,044
we sat you down, and we
talked to you like this.

1873
02:09:59,179 --> 02:10:01,841
And then you go to court
and you beat attempted murder?

1874
02:10:01,981 --> 02:10:05,439
What's he gonna think? Is he
stupid? Is your cousin Frank stupid?

1875
02:10:05,552 --> 02:10:07,452
Answer him!

1876
02:10:07,554 --> 02:10:10,216
No. He's going to assume
that you talked.

1877
02:10:13,426 --> 02:10:15,826
But right now,
Frank doesn't know.

1878
02:10:15,929 --> 02:10:18,329
<i>You want Frank to read
about this in the papers?</i>

1879
02:10:18,431 --> 02:10:20,399
<i>Or do you just want to
walk out of here?</i>

1880
02:10:20,533 --> 02:10:24,162
<i>No bail, no trial, no jail,
just walk out of here today.</i>

1881
02:10:25,271 --> 02:10:26,738
<i>Your choice.</i>

1882
02:10:36,549 --> 02:10:41,043
Opium plants are hard enough
to outlive any war.

1883
02:10:42,355 --> 02:10:46,485
They'll still be here long
after the troops have gone.

1884
02:10:47,861 --> 02:10:52,491
What are you going to do for transportation
when the last US plane goes home?

1885
02:10:53,032 --> 02:10:55,000
I'll figure something out.

1886
02:10:56,536 --> 02:10:58,902
You will see me again,
that's for sure.

1887
02:11:00,573 --> 02:11:03,542
It is not in my best interest
to say this, Frank,

1888
02:11:04,077 --> 02:11:07,046
but quitting while
you're ahead

1889
02:11:07,747 --> 02:11:09,544
is not the same as quitting.

1890
02:11:15,588 --> 02:11:19,217
<i>Only the lonely</i>

1891
02:11:19,759 --> 02:11:23,559
<i>Know this feeling ain't right</i>

1892
02:11:25,965 --> 02:11:28,263
<i>There goes my baby</i>

1893
02:11:29,936 --> 02:11:32,905
<i>There goes my heart</i>

1894
02:11:33,940 --> 02:11:36,909
<i>They're gone forever</i>

1895
02:11:37,744 --> 02:11:41,236
<i>So far apart</i>

1896
02:11:41,614 --> 02:11:44,879
<i>But only the lonely</i>

1897
02:11:46,119 --> 02:11:48,417
<i>Know why</i>

1898
02:11:51,424 --> 02:11:52,857
<i>Yeah.
Hey.</i>

1899
02:11:52,959 --> 02:11:53,948
Go get him.

1900
02:11:56,863 --> 02:11:59,161
Whatever you want to do, baby.
One second.

1901
02:11:59,299 --> 02:12:00,994
It's Frank.
Yeah.

1902
02:12:03,536 --> 02:12:04,594
Yeah.

1903
02:12:04,704 --> 02:12:06,001
Newark.

1904
02:12:06,873 --> 02:12:08,500
Short term,

1905
02:12:09,042 --> 02:12:10,669
parking lot three.

1906
02:12:11,611 --> 02:12:13,010
Short term, lot three.

1907
02:12:13,446 --> 02:12:16,677
That's the Mustang we talking about,
right? Okay, right. What's the plate number?

1908
02:12:16,816 --> 02:12:19,284
K- A...
K- A...

1909
02:12:19,385 --> 02:12:21,512
<i>760.
76.</i>

1910
02:12:21,654 --> 02:12:23,315
<i>Zero. All right.</i>

1911
02:12:24,691 --> 02:12:26,682
There's no short term
lot three at Newark.

1912
02:12:26,826 --> 02:12:29,021
They got letters. A-B-C-D.
I know.

1913
02:12:29,162 --> 02:12:30,959
Maybe he means a time. 3:00?

1914
02:12:31,631 --> 02:12:36,261
This isn't no Jersey license plate,
nor New York, for that matter.

1915
02:12:36,536 --> 02:12:39,300
K- A-7-6-0?
Yup.

1916
02:12:40,340 --> 02:12:41,967
Kilo Alpha?

1917
02:12:42,508 --> 02:12:44,135
A plane tail number?

1918
02:12:44,544 --> 02:12:46,512
Kilo Alpha 760.

1919
02:12:47,680 --> 02:12:50,478
You check commercial planes.
You guys check private planes.

1920
02:12:50,583 --> 02:12:53,347
Everything, from a little fucking Cessna
to the biggest fucking whatever jet.

1921
02:12:53,486 --> 02:12:54,544
All right?

1922
02:12:54,687 --> 02:12:56,018
I'll check military planes.
Where you going, Jimmy?

1923
02:12:56,155 --> 02:12:58,316
You're not going anywhere.
Sit... Sit down.

1924
02:13:21,714 --> 02:13:23,147
Captain?
Yeah?

1925
02:13:23,249 --> 02:13:27,208
Richie Roberts. Essex County.
I know you're expecting us.

1926
02:13:27,620 --> 02:13:30,145
Here's our warrant.
We're looking on the plane.

1927
02:13:30,256 --> 02:13:31,416
Wait! Wait!

1928
02:13:31,557 --> 02:13:34,993
Scotty, stop all these soldiers!
Check their bags. Every one of them.

1929
02:13:45,405 --> 02:13:47,032
No-knock warrant.

1930
02:13:47,774 --> 02:13:50,368
All right. Start upstairs.
Where are they going?

1931
02:13:50,476 --> 02:13:51,602
Step in, sweetie.

1932
02:13:52,412 --> 02:13:53,936
Ma'am, please sit down.

1933
02:13:54,080 --> 02:13:55,240
What is this?

1934
02:13:56,082 --> 02:13:59,540
Whoa, whoa, whoa! All
this stops! Hey. Hey. Hey.

1935
02:13:59,652 --> 02:14:02,553
Nothing leaves this area, all
right? Just slow down with this.

1936
02:14:03,089 --> 02:14:05,057
All right. Stop these trucks.
Hold on, hold on.

1937
02:14:05,158 --> 02:14:07,092
Everything off the
walls! Just pull it all down.

1938
02:14:07,226 --> 02:14:08,523
Damn
thing's a monster, Rich.

1939
02:14:08,628 --> 02:14:09,617
What is this?

1940
02:14:09,762 --> 02:14:10,888
Nothing leaves this area
till we've checked it.

1941
02:14:10,997 --> 02:14:12,294
All right, Captain. Nothing.

1942
02:14:12,398 --> 02:14:14,423
We got to take the plane down,
we got to look in the trucks.

1943
02:14:14,567 --> 02:14:15,761
Every man here gets searched.

1944
02:14:15,902 --> 02:14:17,267
Read the warrant, sir.

1945
02:14:18,438 --> 02:14:20,906
Your husband's
illustrious career is over.

1946
02:14:21,741 --> 02:14:24,938
The Feds are gonna come in,
gonna take everything.

1947
02:14:25,345 --> 02:14:29,304
And then they're gonna take it all.
But not before I get my gratuity.

1948
02:14:30,450 --> 02:14:31,678
So where's the money?

1949
02:14:31,784 --> 02:14:33,342
What are you talking about?
What money?

1950
02:14:33,453 --> 02:14:35,011
What am I talking about?
What money?

1951
02:14:35,121 --> 02:14:39,217
The getaway money that Frank and every
other gangster keeps in his house.

1952
02:14:39,325 --> 02:14:42,624
If you leave now, there's a
chance Frank might not kill you.

1953
02:14:44,464 --> 02:14:45,988
Shut up! Sit down!

1954
02:14:46,132 --> 02:14:47,394
Sit down!

1955
02:15:28,107 --> 02:15:30,439
<i>Defense today announced
the planned evacuation</i>

1956
02:15:30,543 --> 02:15:33,569
<i>of all remaining US
combat forces from Vietnam,</i>

1957
02:15:33,679 --> 02:15:36,409
<i>news that comes
too late for some,</i>

1958
02:15:36,516 --> 02:15:40,145
<i>as here, on a solemn tarmac at
Dover Air Force Base.</i>

1959
02:15:40,286 --> 02:15:43,778
<i>This C-130, loaded down
with its sorrowful cargo,</i>

1960
02:15:43,890 --> 02:15:48,122
<i>a cargo of America's bravest and best,
en route to their final resting places.</i>

1961
02:16:03,810 --> 02:16:05,277
You guys.
Take this coffin down.

1962
02:16:13,820 --> 02:16:15,447
Open it.
I'm not doing that.

1963
02:16:22,228 --> 02:16:24,196
Great fucking dog, huh?

1964
02:16:32,205 --> 02:16:34,070
You stop this, right now.

1965
02:16:34,207 --> 02:16:37,074
My warrant gives me permission
to examine this plane,

1966
02:16:38,377 --> 02:16:39,844
the plane and its cargo.

1967
02:16:40,346 --> 02:16:42,371
Well, you don't have
my permission.

1968
02:16:43,382 --> 02:16:44,849
I don't need it, Captain.

1969
02:16:46,552 --> 02:16:49,180
Easy! Easy, boy.
Come on. Hey!

1970
02:16:50,056 --> 02:16:52,024
Frank, move out of the way.

1971
02:16:59,065 --> 02:17:00,362
Damn.

1972
02:17:05,238 --> 02:17:06,432
That's enough!

1973
02:17:14,247 --> 02:17:16,215
Stay with these coffins. Do
not let them out of your sight.

1974
02:17:16,315 --> 02:17:17,612
Got it. Okay.

1975
02:17:19,252 --> 02:17:20,549
Hey.
Help me out with this.

1976
02:17:46,012 --> 02:17:48,446
That was a military
transport plane.

1977
02:17:48,581 --> 02:17:49,741
If there was heroin
was onboard,

1978
02:17:49,849 --> 02:17:51,646
then someone in the military
would have to be involved.

1979
02:17:51,784 --> 02:17:54,480
Which means that even as
it fights a war that's claimed

1980
02:17:54,620 --> 02:17:58,647
50,000 American lives, the
military is smuggling narcotics.

1981
02:17:58,791 --> 02:18:01,419
That is how this event today
will be interpreted.

1982
02:18:01,527 --> 02:18:03,154
That someone
employed by this office

1983
02:18:03,296 --> 02:18:06,993
believes that the United States Army
is in the drug trafficking business

1984
02:18:07,133 --> 02:18:10,296
and is trying to prove it by
desecrating the remains of young men

1985
02:18:10,436 --> 02:18:13,166
who have given their lives
in the defense of democracy!

1986
02:18:13,306 --> 02:18:15,831
There is dope on that plane.
Shut the fuck up!

1987
02:18:17,310 --> 02:18:20,438
Is it any wonder, then,
because of your actions,

1988
02:18:20,813 --> 02:18:23,111
the entire federal narcotics
program is now in jeopardy

1989
02:18:23,216 --> 02:18:26,185
of being dismantled as
completely and enthusiastically

1990
02:18:26,319 --> 02:18:28,116
as that fucking
transport plane?

1991
02:18:28,221 --> 02:18:30,689
That is what you've accomplished,
Mr. Roberts, single-handedly.

1992
02:18:30,823 --> 02:18:32,450
I had good information.

1993
02:18:32,992 --> 02:18:36,359
That the target of my investigation
was bringing dope in on that plane.

1994
02:18:36,495 --> 02:18:38,429
And that target is?
Frank Lucas.

1995
02:18:38,531 --> 02:18:40,499
Who?
His name's Frank Lucas.

1996
02:18:40,666 --> 02:18:43,134
Who is Frank Lucas? Who does
he work for? Which family?

1997
02:18:43,236 --> 02:18:45,295
He's not Italian. He's black.

1998
02:18:48,841 --> 02:18:51,207
Is that supposed to be
some kind of a joke?

1999
02:18:51,844 --> 02:18:54,074
You're this close to the end of
your career in law enforcement

2000
02:18:54,180 --> 02:18:56,045
and you're making
fucking jokes?

2001
02:18:56,849 --> 02:18:58,976
My investigation indicates

2002
02:18:59,385 --> 02:19:02,320
that Frank Lucas is above the
Mafia in the dope business.

2003
02:19:02,822 --> 02:19:04,483
My investigations
also indicate

2004
02:19:04,590 --> 02:19:08,617
that Frank Lucas buys direct
from a source in Southeast Asia.

2005
02:19:08,728 --> 02:19:11,856
He cuts out the middlemen
and uses US military planes

2006
02:19:11,998 --> 02:19:15,832
and personnel to transport pure
#4 heroin into the United States

2007
02:19:15,935 --> 02:19:19,996
and he's been doing so
on a regular basis since 1969.

2008
02:19:20,106 --> 02:19:23,007
I have cases against every
member of Frank's organization.

2009
02:19:23,109 --> 02:19:24,201
Frank's organization?

2010
02:19:24,343 --> 02:19:28,074
No fucking nigger has ever accomplished
what the American Mafia hasn't in 100 years!

2011
02:19:28,214 --> 02:19:31,149
And you would know that how? Why? 'Cause
your head is stuck up your fucking ass?

2012
02:19:31,250 --> 02:19:33,582
Hey, Lou, do me a favor. Will you
get this fucking kike out of here?

2013
02:19:33,719 --> 02:19:35,186
Kike? Kike?

2014
02:19:35,288 --> 02:19:36,346
Richie, no.

2015
02:19:39,892 --> 02:19:41,018
Hey, Richie!

2016
02:19:42,461 --> 02:19:43,587
Make it stick.

2017
02:19:44,397 --> 02:19:46,865
Spearman's with the coffins.
They're about a quarter mile away.

2018
02:20:18,130 --> 02:20:19,427
Doctor.

2019
02:20:21,267 --> 02:20:22,393
What?

2020
02:20:22,935 --> 02:20:25,904
Fucking Trupo came
by the house, man. It's bad.

2021
02:20:40,786 --> 02:20:43,812
Frankie, I need to speak
with you a minute. Please?

2022
02:20:43,956 --> 02:20:46,789
I got to go, Ma.
No, sit down just a minute.

2023
02:20:46,926 --> 02:20:49,486
Would you please
come back a little later?

2024
02:20:49,628 --> 02:20:50,822
Thank you.

2025
02:20:50,963 --> 02:20:52,931
Ma, I got to go. All right?
Just a few words.

2026
02:20:53,032 --> 02:20:54,294
Listen to me. I got...

2027
02:20:54,433 --> 02:20:56,230
Please, sit down.
Just a few words.

2028
02:20:56,836 --> 02:20:58,428
I've been thinking
about some things.

2029
02:20:58,537 --> 02:21:02,064
If you'd been a preacher, your
brothers would have been preachers.

2030
02:21:02,174 --> 02:21:03,232
Right.

2031
02:21:03,342 --> 02:21:07,278
If you'd been a soldier, they'd
be soldiers. You know that.

2032
02:21:07,380 --> 02:21:11,009
They came here because of you.
You called and they came running.

2033
02:21:11,150 --> 02:21:12,139
Right.

2034
02:21:12,284 --> 02:21:15,685
That's because
they look up to you.

2035
02:21:15,821 --> 02:21:19,621
They always expect you
to know what's best.

2036
02:21:20,393 --> 02:21:22,361
But even they know

2037
02:21:22,661 --> 02:21:24,458
you don't shoot cops.

2038
02:21:26,532 --> 02:21:28,159
Even I know that.

2039
02:21:29,335 --> 02:21:30,802
Eva knows it.
All right, Ma.

2040
02:21:30,903 --> 02:21:33,394
The only one who doesn't
seem to know is you!

2041
02:21:33,506 --> 02:21:36,634
All right, Ma. I got to go. I promise
you, I ain't gonna shoot nobody.

2042
02:21:36,742 --> 02:21:40,508
I never asked you where all this came
from because I didn't want to hear you lie.

2043
02:21:40,646 --> 02:21:42,739
I didn't want you to worry about
it. Now, come on, I got to go.

2044
02:21:42,848 --> 02:21:44,315
Don't lie to me!

2045
02:21:48,854 --> 02:21:50,321
Don't do that.

2046
02:21:51,991 --> 02:21:55,324
Do you want to
make things so bad

2047
02:21:55,428 --> 02:21:58,261
for your family that they'll
leave you? Because they will.

2048
02:21:58,364 --> 02:21:59,388
They'll understand.

2049
02:21:59,532 --> 02:22:01,830
She will leave you.

2050
02:22:01,934 --> 02:22:02,958
All right, Mama.

2051
02:22:05,905 --> 02:22:07,532
I will leave you!

2052
02:22:34,900 --> 02:22:36,697
Got coffins
on the move, Richie.

2053
02:22:36,802 --> 02:22:39,930
We want the transport coffins,
not the ceremonial ones.

2054
02:22:41,474 --> 02:22:42,941
Who are these guys?

2055
02:22:45,177 --> 02:22:46,610
What does it say?

2056
02:22:49,582 --> 02:22:52,142
Bayonne
Custodial Services?

2057
02:22:52,251 --> 02:22:53,878
Bayonne
Cleaning Services?

2058
02:22:53,986 --> 02:22:55,146
Bayonne?
What the fuck is that?

2059
02:22:55,254 --> 02:22:56,721
Give me
the camera, Al.

2060
02:22:59,758 --> 02:23:00,884
Bingo.

2061
02:23:00,993 --> 02:23:03,757
Holy shit.
That's the baseball kid.

2062
02:23:03,896 --> 02:23:05,887
Oh, yeah.
That's Stevie Lucas.

2063
02:23:05,998 --> 02:23:08,558
So what you want to do,
Richie? Follow the trucks?

2064
02:23:08,667 --> 02:23:10,794
No. No. I wanna stay here
with the Lucas kid.

2065
02:23:11,604 --> 02:23:13,231
We'll follow that van.

2066
02:23:13,606 --> 02:23:16,734
You guys better eat up.
We're gonna have a long night.

2067
02:23:27,853 --> 02:23:29,718
Come on,
more precious than gold, man.

2068
02:23:29,822 --> 02:23:31,380
This is more precious
than gold.

2069
02:23:31,957 --> 02:23:34,425
We got a couple more.
Let's go. Stack that up.

2070
02:23:35,461 --> 02:23:37,395
Take it. Take it.

2071
02:23:37,496 --> 02:23:38,929
Give me a second,
man, give me a second.

2072
02:23:41,133 --> 02:23:44,625
Hey. Yo. We got four caskets left, man.
Let's make some fucking money in here.

2073
02:23:47,306 --> 02:23:48,432
What are
they loading in there?

2074
02:23:48,541 --> 02:23:49,735
What the fuck
are they loading in there?

2075
02:23:49,842 --> 02:23:50,934
That's the dope.

2076
02:23:51,043 --> 02:23:54,012
That's got to be
the dope! It's got to be.

2077
02:23:54,647 --> 02:23:55,944
Let's go.

2078
02:23:56,815 --> 02:23:57,975
Let's move.

2079
02:24:50,836 --> 02:24:52,133
Lou, it's Richie.

2080
02:24:52,404 --> 02:24:54,964
We got everybody
in place. Everybody.

2081
02:24:55,074 --> 02:24:56,166
<i>Are you
sure this is it?</i>

2082
02:24:56,275 --> 02:24:57,799
I'm positive, man. Okay?

2083
02:24:58,277 --> 02:24:59,904
All right, they're cutting
and bagging

2084
02:25:00,045 --> 02:25:02,878
in the South Tower of the
Stephen Crane Projects right now.

2085
02:25:03,182 --> 02:25:05,150
<i>Are you sure this
is it? You're positive?</i>

2086
02:25:05,250 --> 02:25:08,014
<i>I'm positive, Lou.
I'm positive. Okay?</i>

2087
02:25:08,120 --> 02:25:10,588
Everything is ready to go.
All the guys are ready to go.

2088
02:25:10,723 --> 02:25:12,816
Just push the button,
give me the warrant, okay?

2089
02:25:13,125 --> 02:25:14,717
Okay. You got it.

2090
02:25:22,434 --> 02:25:23,696
You all right?

2091
02:25:37,750 --> 02:25:41,379
<i>When I in awesome wonder</i>

2092
02:25:41,987 --> 02:25:45,514

<i>The universe displayed</i>

2098
02:26:16,355 --> 02:26:17,913
Got the warrant.
All right.

2099
02:26:22,027 --> 02:26:23,392
Let's go!

2100
02:26:40,279 --> 02:26:41,507
Move!

2101
02:26:44,717 --> 02:26:47,151
Hi, ma'am. What's your name?
What's going on here?

2102
02:26:48,153 --> 02:26:50,144
Get down!
Get down, motherfucker!

2103
02:26:51,323 --> 02:26:54,019
Go.
Okay. Let's go, Al!

2104
02:26:54,193 --> 02:26:55,626
Move it, come on.

2105
02:26:56,528 --> 02:26:58,155
Come on, move it. Move it!

2106
02:27:41,173 --> 02:27:42,299
All set.

2107
02:27:43,041 --> 02:27:44,201
Roger.

2108
02:27:45,878 --> 02:27:46,936
Get ready.

2109
02:27:47,179 --> 02:27:49,010
There you go!
All right.

2110
02:27:50,849 --> 02:27:51,838
Come on.

2111
02:28:00,159 --> 02:28:01,217
At target.

2112
02:28:02,327 --> 02:28:04,295

Hey, Tim.

Girl, why don't you get some clothes on?

Hold on. Where you going?
Where you going?

Come on!

2122
02:28:41,567 --> 02:28:42,898
I'll get it!

02:28:45,304 --> 02:28:46,566
Where's Tim?

2124
02:28:47,573 --> 02:28:48,835
Quiet, kid!

2125
02:28:55,714 --> 02:28:57,739
I got some sandwiches
for you boys, man.

2126
02:29:00,485 --> 02:29:01,918
But where's Tim?

2127
02:29:02,221 --> 02:29:04,621
Shit. Man,
Tim always playing around.

2128
02:29:06,158 --> 02:29:07,455
Hey, man!

2129

Come on, man,

Hey, man, you know I got your

02:31:58,296 --> 02:32:00,787
<i>How sweet the sound</i>

2159
02:32:00,932 --> 02:32:03,230
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.

2160
02:32:03,435 --> 02:32:05,926
Y'all wait right here.
Wait right here.

2161
02:32:06,104 --> 02:32:10,370
<i>That saved a wretch</i>

2162
02:32:10,976 --> 02:32:15,379
<i>Like me</i>

2163
02:32:17,182 --> 02:32:22,279
<i>I once was lost</i>

2164
02:32:23,255 --> 02:32:28,454
<i>But now am found</i>

2165
02:32:29,861 --> 02:32:32,989
Mrs. Lucas, please step
back inside. Yes, Officer.

2166
02:32:33,165 --> 02:32:34,598
Please, Mother Lucas,
step inside, please.

2167
02:32:34,699 --> 02:32:38,066
Respectfully, ma'am, please step
inside. Thank you. Step inside.

2168
02:32:49,381 --> 02:32:51,781
Hands up against the wall.
Stay back.

2169
02:32:54,152 --> 02:32:55,483
Oh, man.

2170
02:32:55,620 --> 02:32:58,316
Don't you owe me money? I'll
get you some more. Here you go.

2171
02:33:00,158 --> 02:33:02,251
Yo, yo! Pigs! Look out!

2172
02:33:02,360 --> 02:33:04,419
NYPD!
Everybody stand still!

2173
02:33:07,499 --> 02:33:09,023
Turner! Go!

2174
02:33:10,535 --> 02:33:12,628
Down on the ground,
motherfucker!

2175
02:33:15,474 --> 02:33:20,776
<i>That Grace appear</i>

2176
02:33:21,813 --> 02:33:24,976
<i>The hour</i>

2177
02:33:25,083 --> 02:33:30,680
<i>I first believed</i>

2178
02:33:46,705 --> 02:33:51,335
...dead servicemen returning from
defending our country in Vietnam...

2179
02:33:53,879 --> 02:33:56,814
Over there. Okay.

2180
02:34:02,387 --> 02:34:05,356
Ladies and gentlemen, at
this stage of the proceedings

2181
02:34:05,457 --> 02:34:08,324
the counsels are ready
for their opening statements.

2182
02:34:08,860 --> 02:34:11,886
For the prosecution,
Mr. Roberts will proceed

2183
02:34:12,030 --> 02:34:14,328
with his opening
statement first.

2184
02:34:14,799 --> 02:34:18,667
Mr. Roberts,
are you ready to proceed?

2185
02:34:20,272 --> 02:34:21,899
Yes, Your Honor.

2186
02:34:25,977 --> 02:34:28,537
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

2187
02:34:32,918 --> 02:34:36,354
the state will show
and you will hear

2188
02:34:36,922 --> 02:34:39,789
that Frank Lucas
is the most dangerous man

2189
02:34:40,859 --> 02:34:43,157
walking the streets
of our city.

2190
02:34:45,897 --> 02:34:49,799
All right, y'all, get on out.
Let me talk to Mr. Richie alone.

2191
02:34:52,904 --> 02:34:56,305
Come on, come on, come on. I pay
y'all by the hour, not by the minute.

2192
02:34:59,110 --> 02:35:00,441
Thank you.

2193
02:35:05,083 --> 02:35:07,313
You ain't wearing a wire,
are you?

2194
02:35:08,119 --> 02:35:09,143
No.

2195
02:35:10,322 --> 02:35:11,380
All right.

2196
02:35:11,489 --> 02:35:15,823
I was talking to my lawyers. They said
something to me, I can't believe it.

2197
02:35:17,295 --> 02:35:20,492
Did you really find a million
dollars in the trunk of a car

2198
02:35:20,632 --> 02:35:22,327
and then turn it in?
Did you do that? Yeah.

2199
02:35:22,467 --> 02:35:23,832
You did that for real, huh?

2200
02:35:23,969 --> 02:35:27,166
My man. Good for you. Shit.

2201
02:35:27,305 --> 02:35:29,398
You know Johnny Law got,
though, right?

2202
02:35:29,608 --> 02:35:31,599
about it, Mr. Richie.

2203
02:35:31,710 --> 02:35:33,940
You know he got it.
You turned that money in,

2204
02:35:34,045 --> 02:35:36,570
he took it and you ain't
get nothing for it. Did you?

2205
02:35:36,681 --> 02:35:38,114
Why did you do that?

2206
02:35:38,516 --> 02:35:40,848
It was the right thing to do.
That's true.

2207
02:35:41,286 --> 02:35:43,254
That's a good answer.
It was the right thing to do.

2208
02:35:43,388 --> 02:35:45,583
The question I have, the question
I've been asking myself is,

2209
02:35:45,690 --> 02:35:47,282
would you do it again?

2210
02:35:48,560 --> 02:35:51,461
I mean, that's a lot of money,
that's a long time ago.

2211
02:35:51,896 --> 02:35:55,423
Many car payments ago, many
child support payments ago.

2212
02:35:57,202 --> 02:36:01,036
So I said to myself, the onlyest
way to find out is to find out.

2213
02:36:02,574 --> 02:36:08,342
Bribery, extortion,
murder, racketeering...

2214
02:36:10,315 --> 02:36:12,044
<i>Now,
you give me an address,</i>

2215
02:36:12,183 --> 02:36:15,448
I'll make sure the car's there, I'll
make sure that money's in that trunk.

2216
02:36:15,553 --> 02:36:16,952
No, thanks.

2217
02:36:17,322 --> 02:36:18,619
You sure?

2218
02:36:20,425 --> 02:36:23,326
Come on, now, Richie. What do
you think, that impresses me?

2219
02:36:23,528 --> 02:36:26,497
You think that you're better than them?
You ain't no better than them other cops.

2220
02:36:26,598 --> 02:36:28,828
In fact, you're the same
as them. You are them.

2221
02:36:29,567 --> 02:36:30,898
Let me ask you this.

2222
02:36:31,036 --> 02:36:34,164
Do you really think that
putting me behind bars

2223
02:36:34,272 --> 02:36:36,172
is going to change
anything on them streets?

2224
02:36:36,274 --> 02:36:37,901
Them dope fiends
is gonna shoot it,

2225
02:36:38,009 --> 02:36:40,136
they're gonna steal for it,
they're gonna die for it.

2226
02:36:40,245 --> 02:36:43,009
Putting me in or out
ain't gonna change one thing.

2227
02:36:43,381 --> 02:36:44,643
Then that's the way it is.

2228
02:36:44,749 --> 02:36:46,580
That's just the way it is.
So what we got, Richie?

2229
02:36:46,785 --> 02:36:48,548
We got me and you
sitting here.

2230
02:36:48,853 --> 02:36:51,754
<i>We got that little snitch-ass
driver for my brother.</i>

2231
02:36:51,856 --> 02:36:53,323
<i>You got a little
bit of powder.</i>

2232
02:36:53,625 --> 02:36:55,490
<i>You're going to need
more than that, Richie.</i>

2233
02:36:55,760 --> 02:36:59,252
<i>I got possession,
supply, conspiracy,</i>

2234
02:36:59,464 --> 02:37:03,560
<i>bribing a law officer. I got people who'll
attest to seeing you kill in cold blood.</i>

2235
02:37:03,702 --> 02:37:07,604
I got your offshore bank accounts,
your real estate, your businesses,

2236
02:37:07,739 --> 02:37:10,207
all bought with money
from heroin.

2237
02:37:10,542 --> 02:37:13,272
And I got hundreds of
parents of dead kids.

2238
02:37:13,712 --> 02:37:16,203
Addicts who OD'ed on your product.
And that's my story for the jury.

2239
02:37:16,314 --> 02:37:19,875
And that's how I make it all stick.
"This man murdered thousands of people.

2240
02:37:19,984 --> 02:37:21,952
"And he did it from a
penthouse, driving a Lincoln. "

2241
02:37:22,087 --> 02:37:23,884
Aside from that, you got
nothing to worry about.

2242
02:37:23,988 --> 02:37:26,855
That's pretty good. But that's why
we go to court, isn't it, Richie?

2243
02:37:26,958 --> 02:37:28,391
'Cause I got witnesses, too.

2244
02:37:28,626 --> 02:37:32,585
I got celebrities. I got sports
figures. I got Harlem, Richie.

2245
02:37:33,131 --> 02:37:36,931
I took care of Harlem, so Harlem's gonna
take care of me. You can believe that.

2246
02:37:37,068 --> 02:37:39,536
I got more than that, Frank.
What you got?

2247
02:37:39,637 --> 02:37:42,299
I've got a line of people
wanting to testify against you,

2248
02:37:42,440 --> 02:37:44,772
it stretches out the door
and around the block.

2249
02:37:44,909 --> 02:37:48,709
<i>You damaged a lot of lives, Frank.
I got the Mazzano crime family.</i>

2250
02:37:48,813 --> 02:37:50,405
<i>Remember those boys?
You put them out of business.</i>

2251
02:37:50,515 --> 02:37:52,073
I ain't got nothing to do
with no Mazzanos.

2252
02:37:52,183 --> 02:37:53,241
Mazzanos ain't got nothing
to do with me.

2253
02:37:53,351 --> 02:37:54,750
They got everything to
do with you. What, they...

2254
02:37:54,853 --> 02:37:55,911
You know why?
Why?

2255
02:37:56,020 --> 02:37:58,580
Because apart from the fact
that they hate you personally,

2256
02:37:59,090 --> 02:38:00,421
they hate what you represent.

2257
02:38:00,525 --> 02:38:03,585
I don't represent nothing
but Frank Lucas. You sure?

2258
02:38:03,995 --> 02:38:05,929
A black businessman like you?

2259
02:38:06,364 --> 02:38:07,888
You represent progress.

2260
02:38:08,633 --> 02:38:11,625
The kind of progress that's going
to see them lose a lot of money.

2261
02:38:12,203 --> 02:38:15,764
With you out of the way,
everything can return to normal.

2262
02:38:16,908 --> 02:38:18,136
My man.

2263
02:38:22,981 --> 02:38:24,972
You know what normal
is to me, Richie?

2264
02:38:25,283 --> 02:38:28,184
I ain't seen normal since
I was six years old.

2265
02:38:29,821 --> 02:38:32,415
Normal is seeing the police
right up to my house

2266
02:38:32,524 --> 02:38:35,459
dragging my little 12-year-old
cousin out, tying him to a pole,

2267
02:38:35,560 --> 02:38:38,688
shoving a shotgun in his mouth
so hard they bust his teeth.

2268
02:38:38,830 --> 02:38:42,095
Then they bust two shotgun shells in
his head and knock his fucking head off.

2269
02:38:42,200 --> 02:38:43,428
That's what normal is to me.

2270
02:38:43,535 --> 02:38:46,595
I didn't give a fuck
about no police then.

2271
02:38:46,704 --> 02:38:49,673
I don't give a fuck about
no police now. Shit.

2272
02:38:50,041 --> 02:38:52,271
You know what, you can do
whatever you want to do.

2273
02:38:52,410 --> 02:38:54,878
So, it don't mean nothing to me
for you to show up tomorrow morning

2274
02:38:55,013 --> 02:38:57,481
with your head blown off. Do
you understand what I'm saying?

2275
02:38:58,016 --> 02:39:00,382
Yeah, Frank. Get in line.

2276
02:39:01,052 --> 02:39:03,282
That one stretches
around the block, too.

2277
02:39:06,691 --> 02:39:08,022
All right.

2278
02:39:11,763 --> 02:39:13,196
What do you want to do?

2279
02:39:19,904 --> 02:39:21,565
You know what you got to do.

2280
02:39:21,739 --> 02:39:23,502
What do you want me to do?
Snitch, huh?

2281
02:39:23,608 --> 02:39:25,075
I know you don't want me
to give up no cops.

2282
02:39:25,210 --> 02:39:26,677
What do you want?
You want gangsters?

2283
02:39:27,278 --> 02:39:30,873
Pick one. Jew gangsters?
Mick gangsters? Guineas?

2284
02:39:31,549 --> 02:39:34,347
They've been bleeding Harlem dry
since they got off the boat, Richie.

2285
02:39:34,452 --> 02:39:38,252
I don't give a fuck about no
crime figures. You can have them.

2286
02:39:39,257 --> 02:39:40,690
I'll take them, too.

2287
02:39:40,959 --> 02:39:42,859
You'll take them, too?

2288
02:39:48,032 --> 02:39:51,695
No, you didn't. You're talking
about police. You want police?

2289
02:39:52,270 --> 02:39:53,396
You want your own kind?

2290
02:39:53,505 --> 02:39:54,767
They're not my kind.

2291
02:39:55,540 --> 02:39:58,100
They're in business with you,
Frank. They ain't my kind.

2292
02:39:58,376 --> 02:40:02,278
They ain't my kind like the
Italians are not yours. All right?

2293
02:40:05,283 --> 02:40:06,272
Huh.

2294
02:40:15,860 --> 02:40:18,226
What can you
promise me, Richie?

2295
02:40:21,266 --> 02:40:24,235
I can promise you,
you lie about one name,

2296
02:40:24,602 --> 02:40:26,331
you'll never
get out of prison.

2297
02:40:26,804 --> 02:40:31,901
You lie about one dollar, in one offshore
account, you'll never get out of prison.

2298
02:40:32,877 --> 02:40:37,109
Now you can live life rich in jail
for the rest of your born days,

2299
02:40:37,782 --> 02:40:39,841
or be poor outside
for some of them.

2300
02:40:41,119 --> 02:40:43,417
That's what I can promise you.

2301
02:40:46,324 --> 02:40:53,025
I want them cops, Richie. That's
what I want, I want them cops

2302
02:40:53,965 --> 02:40:56,900
that took that money
out of my pockets.

2303
02:40:59,904 --> 02:41:01,030
Him, too.

2304
02:41:01,472 --> 02:41:03,133
All right. Okay.

2305
02:41:05,343 --> 02:41:07,436
Hey, Spearman? Spearman.

2306

2307
02:41:10,949 --> 02:41:13,543
See this guy here,

Well done, Jimmy.

02:41:42,113 --> 02:41:44,980
<i>say federal prosecutors,

2318

engaged in some form of corruption.</i>

MacNamara. Vendazzo.

02:42:21,419 --> 02:42:22,716
Trupo.

2330
02:42:26,024 --> 02:42:27,457
You are special.

2331
02:43:10,868 --> 02:43:12,733
It's good work, Frank.

You don't want a drink
or something? Celebrate?

2334
02:43:19,844 --> 02:43:21,243
You got any holy water?

2335

Oh, shit. Yeah.

You all right?

2342
02:45:41,768 --> 02:45:44,669
That's a fancy way of
saying coffee with milk.

2343
02:45:44,805 --> 02:45:46,170
Yeah.
$2.50.

2344
02:45:49,710 --> 02:45:52,144
So you been talking
to your brothers?

2345
02:45:52,245 --> 02:45:53,803
No, no, I ain't talked
to them in years.

2346
02:45:53,980 --> 02:45:55,572
It's probably
best for them.

2347
02:45:59,586 --> 02:46:01,781
What the hell am I going
to do out here, Richie?

2348
02:46:01,888 --> 02:46:04,015
I don't know

Hey, I told ya, I ain't gonna
let you starve, all right?

2350
02:46:09,429 --> 02:46:11,056
Obviously,

2354
02:46:33,253 --> 02:46:35,118
Frederick Douglass
Boulevard.

2355
02:46:35,489 --> 02:46:37,855
This used to be Eighth
Avenue, why do they call it

2356
02:46:37,958 --> 02:46:41,394
Frederick Douglass
Boulevard now?

2357
02:46:45,665 --> 02:46:47,064

right here.

2358
02:46:47,234 --> 02:46:48,667
This was all me.

2359
02:46:50,237 --> 02:46:52,364
In my day there were so many
niggers out here buying dope

2360
02:46:52,472 --> 02:46:55,134
<i>you could've made
a Tarzan movie.</i>

2361
02:46:55,876 --> 02:46:59,403
You know, one phone call, I'll be
right back in business, you know that.

2362
02:46:59,513 --> 02:47:01,071
You don't do that, Frank.

2363
02:47:01,248 --> 02:47:02,840
These days I keep
all my promises.

2364
02:47:14,094 --> 02:47:16,426
Why'd you come
and get me, huh?

2365

You're a superstar, Frank.

A superstar?

2367
02:47:21,001 --> 02:47:25,028
Your evidence alone
gave me 150 convictions.

2368
02:47:25,539 --> 02:47:28,531
Thought the least we could
do is give you a ride home.

2369
02:47:28,975 --> 02:47:30,806
Yeah, you sure
did that.

2370

You gave me a ride
home. Free ride.

2371
02:47:33,346 --> 02:47:35,780
Coming to gangsters.

02:47:39,519 --> 02:47:40,486
What?

2373
02:47:42,989 --> 02:47:45,890
Ain't nothin', man.
