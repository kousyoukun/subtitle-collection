1
00:01:49,206 --> 00:01:52,039
BUMPY: Happy Thanksgiving!

2
00:01:54,912 --> 00:01:55,902
Come here!

3
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:00,642
Yeah!
MAN: Right here!

4
00:02:00,752 --> 00:02:02,413
MAN: Toss me a bird, Bumpy!

5
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,953
WOMAN 1: Bumpy!

6
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,266
Harlem - 1968

7
00:02:05,356 --> 00:02:07,221
Yeah!
WOMAN 2: Bumpy! We love you!

8
00:02:07,358 --> 00:02:08,917
There you go, darling.

9
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:12,326
WOMAN 3: Over here! Over here!

10
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:17,732
Frank! Come on!

11
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,396
Come here.

12
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:36,385
BUMPY: This is the problem.
This is what's wrong
with America.

13
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:40,717
It's gotten so big,
you just can't find your way.

14
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,624
The grocery store
on the corner is
now a supermarket.

15
00:02:45,902 --> 00:02:49,065
The candy store
is a McDonald's.

16
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,103
And this place,
a super-fucking
discount store.

17
00:02:54,477 --> 00:02:57,412
Where's the pride
of ownership, huh?

18
00:02:58,816 --> 00:03:00,613
Where's the personal service?

19
00:03:07,758 --> 00:03:10,421
You see what I mean? Shit.

20
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:16,924
I mean, what right
do they have, of cutting
out the suppliers,

21
00:03:17,302 --> 00:03:20,465
pushing out all the middlemen,

22
00:03:21,106 --> 00:03:24,599
buying direct
from the manufacturer?

23
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:29,412
Sony this, Toshiba that.

24
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:33,451
All them Chinks
putting Americans
out of work.

25
00:03:40,627 --> 00:03:42,254
That's the way it is now.

26
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:47,694
You all right?

27
00:03:47,902 --> 00:03:50,598
You can't find
the heart of anything

28
00:03:52,473 --> 00:03:54,441
to stick the knife.

29
00:03:56,844 --> 00:03:57,936
Hey!

30
00:03:58,546 --> 00:04:00,310
Anybody here?

31
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,939
Can I help you?

32
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:03,416
Call an ambulance.

33
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,248
Forget it, Frank.

34
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:09,019
There's no one in charge.

35
00:04:13,997 --> 00:04:15,658
Call an ambulance!

36
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:19,301
REPORTER: Some say
Bumpy Johnson was a great man,

37
00:04:19,403 --> 00:04:21,496
according to the eulogies,
a giving man,

38
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,765
a man of the people.

39
00:04:22,873 --> 00:04:24,534
No one chose to use
in their remembrances

40
00:04:24,675 --> 00:04:26,610
the word most often
associated with

41
00:04:26,712 --> 00:04:28,771
Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson,
"gangster,"

42
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,475
whose passing has brought
a who's who of mourners
on this chilly afternoon.

43
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:35,018
Lucchese mob boss
Dominic Cattano,

44
00:04:35,153 --> 00:04:36,814
Harlem crime figure
Nicky Barnes.

45
00:04:36,922 --> 00:04:37,981
MAN: Nicky! Nicky!

46
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:39,217
REPORTER: From the
political arena,

47
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:41,725
the Governor has come down,
the Mayor of New York,

48
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:46,195
and Chief of Police and
Commissioner, sports and
entertainment luminaries.

49
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:49,501
REPORTER 2.; Bumpy Johnson,
age 62 when he passed,

50
00:04:49,602 --> 00:04:53,130
was a folk hero among
Harlem locals for
over four decades.

51
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,606
Regarded by some
as the Robin Hood of Harlem,

52
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:57,574
by others as
a ruthless criminal...

53
00:04:57,711 --> 00:04:59,406
TANGO: I don't understand,
you know.

54
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:03,745
I would've thought that
Bumpy would put out
a better spread, you know?

55
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:05,716
You want something?
No, thanks.

56
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,478
I want chicken wings
at my funeral.

57
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:10,080
MAN: All right, Nicky Barnes.
NICKY: Who is that?

58
00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:11,920
He didn't know what hit him,
you know what I'm saying?

59
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,358
I just kept popping him
in the face 'Cause
that's what I do.

60
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,871
I don't have a lighter.
You have a light?

61
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:35,040
FRANK: Okay?

62
00:05:35,452 --> 00:05:37,113
TANGO: That's very good.

63
00:05:37,654 --> 00:05:38,951
Hey, Frank.

64
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:44,056
Go get me a light
while you're at it.

65
00:05:45,463 --> 00:05:47,090
Appreciate it.

66
00:05:47,965 --> 00:05:49,296
Don Cattano.

67
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:51,493
Hey, how you doing, Rossi?

68
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:52,900
Good.

69
00:05:53,005 --> 00:05:54,370
BARTENDER: Would you
like a drink, sir?

70
00:05:54,473 --> 00:05:57,237
Give him a scotch
on the rocks.

71
00:06:02,148 --> 00:06:04,207
Come on. Come on.

72
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:15,452
I know you're hurting, Frank.

73
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,423
So am I.

74
00:06:17,966 --> 00:06:19,092
I'm all right.

75
00:06:19,634 --> 00:06:21,727
You gonna be all right?
Yeah.

76
00:06:22,037 --> 00:06:24,471
I'm sure Bumpy didn't say
anything to you, but
he made me promise

77
00:06:24,606 --> 00:06:26,836
that if anything
ever happened to him,

78
00:06:26,975 --> 00:06:29,968
that I should make sure
that you want for nothing.

79
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:33,074
I appreciate that.

80
00:06:33,716 --> 00:06:37,413
You know, half the people
in this room owed
Bumpy money when he died.

81
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,648
They think I'm gonna forget
to collect, but I'm gonna
get that money.

82
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,851
Well, that's the spirit.
Go get 'em.

83
00:06:47,131 --> 00:06:50,797
PROFESSOR: Mr. Roberts,
taking the prosecution's side,

84
00:06:50,934 --> 00:06:55,065
give us US v. Mead,
subject, issues,
what the determination was

85
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,674
and what it means to us today.

86
00:06:58,109 --> 00:07:02,637
Class, you'll be critiquing
Mr. Roberts, so pay attention.

87
00:07:04,983 --> 00:07:07,077
RICHIE. ; I hate hearing
my name called, you know?

88
00:07:07,186 --> 00:07:10,121
It means I gotta get up
in front of the class,
I gotta turn around,

89
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:14,318
and I know every one of
those people there,
they know more than I do.

90
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,419
The number one fear of people,
it ain't dying,
it's public speaking.

91
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:19,931
I get physically ill,
I wanna throw up.

92
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:21,830
And that's what you
wanna do for a living.

93
00:07:21,968 --> 00:07:24,095
No, I don't wanna be
like that, man,
I wanna beat it.

94
00:07:24,204 --> 00:07:25,262
JAY: So, should I do this?

95
00:07:25,372 --> 00:07:27,772
No, he'll take it from me,
he knows me. I've known
him since high school.

96
00:07:27,874 --> 00:07:30,308
From high school?
Good morning. Yeah.

97
00:07:30,444 --> 00:07:32,504
He doesn't take it,
just throw it in.
It's good service.

98
00:07:32,647 --> 00:07:35,115
Throw it in? All right.
Yeah.

99
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,016
JAY: What's up, Susie?
Hey, Jay.

100
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,020
How you doing, baby?
All right.

101
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:41,486
All right. Ready?

102
00:07:59,076 --> 00:08:00,168
Hey! That's his head!

103
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:11,784
RICHIE: You're supposed
to be my friend, asshole!

104
00:08:12,724 --> 00:08:15,284
CAMPIZl: I swear
to God, Richie, I
didn't know it was you.

105
00:08:15,393 --> 00:08:18,487
I would never slam a door
on your hand, knowingly.

106
00:08:18,597 --> 00:08:19,757
You bit my fucking hand.

107
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:21,561
What are you doing
serving subpoenas, anyway?

108
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,669
JAY: We're on loan to County.
County?

109
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,828
How's that working
out for you?
RICHIE: Hey, fuck you.

110
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:30,034
Hey, I'm sorry.
Consider me served.
Can we leave it there?

111
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,043
Assault on a police officer?
I don't think so.

112
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,410
Hey, for old times' sake.
What can we do?

113
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:36,881
What do you want?
What can I give you?

114
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,247
What do you get for assault
with a deadly weapon, Jay?

115
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,250
Five years minimum.
RICHIE: Five years.

116
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:45,518
Guys, come on. No, guys.
What do you want?
Who do you want?

117
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,088
Who do you got?

118
00:08:47,228 --> 00:08:51,824
You want Big Al's bookie?
You want his accountant?
I'll give him to you.

119
00:08:55,003 --> 00:08:56,003
[New Jersey]

120
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:02,438
CAMPIZl: Stop, stop, stop.

121
00:09:03,112 --> 00:09:04,704
There he is.

122
00:09:07,216 --> 00:09:09,377
That's him.
That's the bookie.

123
00:09:09,485 --> 00:09:11,215
RICHIE: All right,
Carlo, get lost.

124
00:09:11,321 --> 00:09:12,913
Get out of the car.

125
00:09:13,056 --> 00:09:16,856
CAMPIZl: This is...
I'd rather not.
JAY: Come on. Let's go.

126
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,690
Take it ease.

127
00:09:38,318 --> 00:09:40,309
JAY: Want to stay with him
or the car?

128
00:09:40,453 --> 00:09:42,921
Let's see who comes
for the car.

129
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,132
Think he made us?

130
00:09:59,607 --> 00:10:01,940
You called in the warrants,
right? So, where are they?

131
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,633
I just called, man.

132
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:07,578
I called and walked back here
and 10 seconds has gone by.

133
00:10:10,051 --> 00:10:11,916
I saw him with the slips, Jay.

134
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,684
You saw policy slips?
You saw grocery bags.
You don't know what's in 'em.

135
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:18,191
Yes, I do and so do you.
Don't give me that bull.

136
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:21,296
What's the rush, Richie?
Half an hour,
the warrant will be here.

137
00:10:21,397 --> 00:10:25,333
I got night school, all right?
Guess you're gonna miss it.

138
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:34,606
RICHIE: Fuck this. Come on.
You sure?

139
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:36,576
Yeah, I'm sure. Let's go.

140
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:31,070
Fuck.

141
00:11:32,842 --> 00:11:34,207
Jay.
Yeah?

142
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:41,881
Fuck.

143
00:11:46,223 --> 00:11:48,521
MAN ON RADIO. ;
WBZ, honey bunch,
the show they all love!

144
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,923
It's the groovy sound
of the Jefferson Kaye
Saturday Night Show.

145
00:11:51,061 --> 00:11:53,223
Dig, honey, it's
coming up time for news.

146
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:55,992
Jumping on the ceiling,
wallpaper peeling on WBZ.

147
00:11:56,101 --> 00:11:58,365
Stick around,
the Jace-man's got 10.
Back in 10.

148
00:12:06,145 --> 00:12:07,669
It's not just a
couple of bucks, all right?

149
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,407
It's the same thing
in principle.

150
00:12:10,483 --> 00:12:11,711
Oh, are we talking principles?

151
00:12:11,817 --> 00:12:15,275
Richie, a cop who turns
in this kind of money,
says one thing.

152
00:12:15,654 --> 00:12:19,113
He turns in cops
who take money.
We'll be fucking pariahs.

153
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:20,692
Yeah, well, then
we're fucked both ways.

154
00:12:20,794 --> 00:12:23,558
Not if we keep it.
Only if we don't, then
you're right, we're fucked.

155
00:12:23,663 --> 00:12:25,563
But not if we keep it.

156
00:12:26,466 --> 00:12:28,866
God damn it, man!
Did we ask for this?

157
00:12:28,969 --> 00:12:31,939
Did we put a gun to
someone's head and say,
"Give us your money"?

158
00:12:32,073 --> 00:12:35,804
Cops kill cops
they can't trust.

159
00:12:39,414 --> 00:12:41,439
We can't turn it in, man.

160
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,557
Can you believe that?

161
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:03,166
How much is it?

162
00:13:03,774 --> 00:13:06,106
$987,000.

163
00:13:08,113 --> 00:13:10,479
Well, what happened
to the rest of it?

164
00:13:12,984 --> 00:13:14,110
TOBACK: What the hell
are you doing

165
00:13:14,219 --> 00:13:15,413
counting it out here
in front of everybody?

166
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,509
Are you nuts?

167
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:22,327
Get it back in the bags,
seal them up and down
into the property room.

168
00:13:31,571 --> 00:13:33,597
DETECTIVE:
You fucking Boy Scout.

169
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,828
What? What?

170
00:14:14,532 --> 00:14:17,033
[New York City Police Plaza]

171
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:26,827
Detective Trupo, sign here.

172
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,800
TRUPO: You guys ready to make
a lot of fucking money?

173
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,099
MAN 1: Always.
MAN 2: Hell, yeah.

174
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,469
TRUPO: Fucking A.

175
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:39,138
TRUPO: Oh, look at this.

176
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,371
There you go.

177
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,880
TRUPO: All right,
look at this.
MAN 2: Fucking beautiful.

178
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:45,848
There's three more boats.

179
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,555
TRUPO: Hey, don't lose
any of that shit.

180
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:57,994
MAN 1: I know.
TRUPO: All right, be careful.

181
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:03,499
Hey! Just enough for
the reagent test.

182
00:15:05,273 --> 00:15:07,002
A little less.

183
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:15,015
ROSSI. ; This is the
French Connection dope.

184
00:15:15,117 --> 00:15:19,417
Kilos of the same dope
Eddie Egan and
Sonny Grosso took from us.

185
00:15:19,555 --> 00:15:21,785
The cops seize it,
arrest everyone,

186
00:15:21,924 --> 00:15:24,290
then they start taking it out
of the evidence room,

187
00:15:24,427 --> 00:15:27,886
whacking it down to nothing
and selling it back to us.

188
00:15:27,998 --> 00:15:30,398
They basically control
the market with it.

189
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,060
Mr. Rossi,
I have a surprise for you.

190
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,196
ROSSI. ; They've been doing it
for years now. They
live off it, our dope.

191
00:15:36,306 --> 00:15:37,296
What do you think?

192
00:15:37,442 --> 00:15:39,307
What the fuck is happening
to the world, Frank?

193
00:15:39,777 --> 00:15:41,404
Those fucking crooks.

194
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:43,872
Yeah. Sad about Bumpy.

195
00:15:46,351 --> 00:15:48,615
Things are never gonna
be the same in Harlem.

196
00:15:48,753 --> 00:15:53,748
You walk down the street,
nobody bothers you 'Cause
Bumpy was making sure of it.

197
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:55,392
Half a key.

198
00:15:55,929 --> 00:15:57,556
How is your day now?

199
00:15:58,531 --> 00:16:00,624
It's chaos.
Every gorilla for hisself.

200
00:16:03,304 --> 00:16:04,965
Motherfucker!

201
00:16:07,808 --> 00:16:11,403
Who can live like that?
There has to be order.

202
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,647
That would never
happen with Italians.

203
00:16:13,781 --> 00:16:17,479
More important than
any one man's life,
is order.

204
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:26,854
Frank.

205
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:30,459
Hey. Come on in,
Claude. Sit down.

206
00:16:35,872 --> 00:16:37,533
FRANK: How y'all doing, huh?
Good.

207
00:16:37,707 --> 00:16:39,072
So, you see Nate over there?
Yeah?

208
00:16:39,175 --> 00:16:40,473
MAN: Yeah, all the time.

209
00:16:40,577 --> 00:16:42,636
Nate is everywhere. He's good.
Yeah.

210
00:16:42,746 --> 00:16:44,941
He's still over there?
Yeah. He's got himself
a club now.

211
00:16:45,049 --> 00:16:47,483
Okay. Whereabouts, Saigon?
MAN: Bangkok.

212
00:16:47,651 --> 00:16:49,983
Bangkok? I don, t think he, s
ever coming home.

213
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,017
Come on.

214
00:17:22,556 --> 00:17:25,320
On the house,
for our boys in uniform.

215
00:17:25,425 --> 00:17:28,360
Thank you, sugar.
That's very kind.

216
00:17:28,995 --> 00:17:30,224
REDTOP: Thank Frank.

217
00:17:30,364 --> 00:17:31,831
Thanks, Frank.

218
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:34,828
Just relax.

219
00:17:35,904 --> 00:17:39,305
You have to boot
this shit a couple of times.

220
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:43,043
The cops keep cutting it,
selling the shit.

221
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:48,250
I don't want to say anything,
'Cause the price is right,

222
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:51,547
but that shit in Nam is way,

223
00:17:52,722 --> 00:17:56,352
way heavy.

224
00:18:20,253 --> 00:18:23,347
Did you ain't seen
the jar, Frank, hmm?

225
00:18:23,456 --> 00:18:25,583
I think you walked
right past it.

226
00:18:26,392 --> 00:18:30,294
The money jar, Frank.
What do I gotta do,
put a fucking sign on it?

227
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:31,418
Hmm?

228
00:18:34,768 --> 00:18:36,895
Look at this nigger
right here. You know, Frank,

229
00:18:37,004 --> 00:18:39,199
Bumpy don't own 116th no more.

230
00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:41,202
Bumpy don't own
no real estate in
Harlem right now.

231
00:18:41,308 --> 00:18:44,107
I'm the landlord
and the lease is 20%.

232
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,945
Look, don't sell dope then,
Frank. Get a real job.

233
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:52,211
You need a fucking job, Frank?
Hmm? Is that what you need?

234
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,651
Well, you can
come work for me.

235
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:56,758
Okay? You can drive me around,
huh? You can open my doors.

236
00:18:56,859 --> 00:19:01,990
Huh? "Yes, sir", "No, sir",
"Right away, sir", " Anything
you want, Massa Johnson".

237
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,790
Twenty percent.

238
00:19:12,876 --> 00:19:15,573
Twenty percent
is my profit, Tango.

239
00:19:17,515 --> 00:19:19,642
If I give you that,
then what do I got left?
Nothing, man.

240
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,183
Twenty percent puts
me out of business,

241
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,151
and every somebody
you know out of business.

242
00:19:23,555 --> 00:19:26,615
There's legitimate ways of
doing things, Tango,
and then there's this way.

243
00:19:26,725 --> 00:19:28,920
Not even Bumpy took 20%.

244
00:19:29,027 --> 00:19:30,961
Bumpy's fucking dead.

245
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,697
My man.

246
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:37,466
Twenty percent?

247
00:19:46,145 --> 00:19:48,080
Twenty percent.
Doc, let's go.

248
00:20:06,201 --> 00:20:08,999
Out. Good job. Sit.

249
00:20:10,706 --> 00:20:14,541
A leader, like a shepherd,

250
00:20:14,711 --> 00:20:17,680
he sends his fastest
nimble sheep, out front.

251
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,611
And the others will follow.

252
00:20:19,716 --> 00:20:23,152
While the shepherd,
he walks quietly behind it.

253
00:20:23,252 --> 00:20:24,811
Here, boy!
Here we go. Right here.

254
00:20:24,922 --> 00:20:26,412
Bring it here. Yeah.

255
00:20:27,358 --> 00:20:31,590
Now he's got the stick,
and the cane,
he'll use it!

256
00:20:32,329 --> 00:20:34,058
If he has to.

257
00:20:34,164 --> 00:20:36,497
But most times
he doesn't have to.

258
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:40,367
He moves the whole
herd quietly.

259
00:20:43,274 --> 00:20:47,677
What right do they have
cutting out the supplier?

260
00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:50,438
The middleman.
Buying direct.

261
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,116
Putting Americans
out of work.

262
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:58,086
That's the way
it is now, Frank.

263
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:02,460
That's the way it is.

264
00:21:19,281 --> 00:21:22,944
MAN 1 ON TV. ;
The drug problem in Vietnam
is more than marijuana.

265
00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:25,281
At this point, it is
estimated that one third

266
00:21:25,387 --> 00:21:27,583
of American troops
are experimenting

267
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,521
with opium and heroin.

268
00:21:30,126 --> 00:21:32,094
MAN 2 ON TV. ;
The authorities say
they have confiscated

269
00:21:32,195 --> 00:21:35,722
large quantities of marijuana,
heroin and pills.

270
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:38,933
Every person
and every vehicle
going through the gates

271
00:21:39,036 --> 00:21:41,095
is subject to
a thorough shakedown.

272
00:21:43,756 --> 00:21:45,155
MAN 3 ON TV. ; Soldiers have
access to the drugs at
many rest and relaxation spots

273
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:49,318
in Bangkok, Saigon and
other areas throughout
Vietnam and Thailand.

274
00:21:49,462 --> 00:21:53,559
Officials say the easy
availability, relatively
cheap cost

275
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:57,330
and high purity of heroin
throughout Saigon
and the Far East,

276
00:21:57,471 --> 00:22:01,908
is leading to an epidemic
of heroin addiction
among US soldiers.

277
00:22:05,046 --> 00:22:07,139
Operator.
FRANK: Yeah, international.

278
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:09,512
What city?
Bangkok.

279
00:22:09,651 --> 00:22:12,415
You know the country code?
Yeah, 376.

280
00:22:12,687 --> 00:22:14,211
For the first three minutes,
it'll be...

281
00:22:14,322 --> 00:22:17,087
I got it, I got it. I got it.

282
00:22:21,864 --> 00:22:22,853
Hello?

283
00:22:22,998 --> 00:22:24,488
Soul Brothers.
Hey, can I help you?

284
00:22:24,633 --> 00:22:25,793
Nate.

285
00:22:26,202 --> 00:22:28,137
Do I know you?
Yeah, it's me.

286
00:22:28,238 --> 00:22:30,866
Your cousin, negro.

287
00:22:35,213 --> 00:22:36,840
Go on, get yourself
a new suit.

288
00:23:13,921 --> 00:23:15,115
Look, I'm sorry.

289
00:23:15,222 --> 00:23:16,587
Oh, please, Richie.

290
00:23:17,124 --> 00:23:20,356
It couldn't be avoided.
I'll take him next weekend,
all right?

291
00:23:20,896 --> 00:23:22,420
We're moving.

292
00:23:22,564 --> 00:23:24,532
What? Where?

293
00:23:26,034 --> 00:23:28,559
The St. Regis.
What do you care?

294
00:23:30,907 --> 00:23:32,374
To my sister's.

295
00:23:32,475 --> 00:23:34,773
Your sister's? In Vegas?
Yeah.

296
00:23:34,911 --> 00:23:37,573
You are not moving
to Las Vegas.
Not with Michael, anyway.

297
00:23:38,915 --> 00:23:42,009
What am I supposed
to do with him, leave him
with you? There's a picture.

298
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:45,084
Hey, guys! Be cool.

299
00:23:47,624 --> 00:23:51,116
Laurie, Las Vegas is not
the kind of place
that you raise a kid.

300
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:54,424
Oh, like this is a
good environment?
And around your friends?

301
00:23:54,565 --> 00:23:56,363
When am I supposed
to see my boy?

302
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:58,696
This weekend.
Last weekend.

303
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:01,695
God damn it.

304
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:04,434
Hey! I asked you nice
to shut up, right?

305
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:05,702
Now I'm gonna
have to kill you.

306
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,974
I swear I will pull out
my gun and put a bullet
in your fucking heads!

307
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:11,139
Now stop what you're doing
and pick up the glass!

308
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,910
Calm down, man.
Okay, be cool.

309
00:24:16,323 --> 00:24:17,790
Fucking crazy, man.

310
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:20,784
You don't have a gun.

311
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:25,060
You sure?

312
00:24:33,141 --> 00:24:34,972
You are crazy, Richie.

313
00:24:39,281 --> 00:24:41,442
You don't have room for us.

314
00:24:43,151 --> 00:24:44,983
I'll see you in court.

315
00:24:46,689 --> 00:24:48,281
Come on, Michael.

316
00:24:48,658 --> 00:24:50,421
Say bye to your dad.

317
00:24:51,694 --> 00:24:53,889
Get over here.
Hey, kiddo.

318
00:24:55,198 --> 00:24:58,498
I'll see you next week,
all right? We'll do something.

319
00:24:59,436 --> 00:25:01,961
LAURIE: Let's get you
an ice cream.

320
00:25:26,332 --> 00:25:30,200
You have 10 minutes
remaining. Ten minutes.

321
00:25:48,095 --> 00:25:52,095
[Bangkok]

322
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:39,402
MAN: Shake it, baby.
Shake it, shake it, shake it.

323
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,548
MAN: Oh, come on, girl.
Don't tell me $5 don't get
me a little something.

324
00:26:46,652 --> 00:26:49,177
GIRL: Can you dig
that it costs money
to be here?

325
00:26:49,556 --> 00:26:50,921
MAN: Oh, come on, girl.

326
00:27:08,102 --> 00:27:11,102
He said "a lot".

327
00:27:12,102 --> 00:27:13,602
Is he your cousin?

328
00:27:14,603 --> 00:27:16,603
Yes... He is.

329
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:19,603
He's my ex-wife's cousin.

330
00:27:20,603 --> 00:27:22,103
Ask him how much he wants.

331
00:27:24,827 --> 00:27:26,887
How much you want, Frank?

332
00:27:27,631 --> 00:27:29,622
Tell him I want 100 keys.

333
00:27:31,768 --> 00:27:34,499
NATE: Frank, ain't nobody
I know can get you that
much personally, all right?

334
00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:36,470
You're gonna have to
piece it together from
several sources,

335
00:27:36,607 --> 00:27:38,097
and it's not gonna
be 100% pure.

336
00:27:38,209 --> 00:27:40,007
I don't want that.

337
00:27:40,546 --> 00:27:42,173
I know what you
don't want, Frank,

338
00:27:42,314 --> 00:27:44,407
but look, what you're
gonna need is to get

339
00:27:44,516 --> 00:27:47,007
to the Chiu-Chou syndicate,
all right?

340
00:27:47,152 --> 00:27:49,586
Cholon, Saigon.
If they're gonna
deal with you at all.

341
00:27:49,688 --> 00:27:51,987
I understand that,
but by then it's gonna
be too late.

342
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:54,685
It'll be already chopped up.
I wanna go get it where
they go get it from.

343
00:27:54,828 --> 00:27:55,852
I wanna go to the source.

344
00:27:55,995 --> 00:27:57,019
So, you're gonna
go get it yourself?

345
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:59,121
Why not?

346
00:27:59,232 --> 00:28:01,598
Huh? I came this far.

347
00:28:02,335 --> 00:28:03,768
You're gonna go
into the motherfucking jungle?

348
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,236
I'm in the jungle.
Look around.

349
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:07,136
They're eating these roaches
and whatever that is.

350
00:28:07,241 --> 00:28:08,936
Nigga, I'm talking
about snakes, all right?

351
00:28:09,043 --> 00:28:10,806
I'm talking about tigers,
I'm talking about Vietcong,

352
00:28:10,911 --> 00:28:14,608
I'm talking about mosquitoes
that'll fucking kill your ass.

353
00:28:15,749 --> 00:28:16,910
You wanna go into the jungle?

354
00:28:17,018 --> 00:28:18,645
We're going.

355
00:28:20,655 --> 00:28:21,952
Fuck it. Let's go.
We're going.

356
00:28:22,057 --> 00:28:23,285
Why not?
Let's go.

357
00:29:06,237 --> 00:29:07,865
Hey, Frank.

358
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,534
This whole spot's locked down
by the Kuomintang,

359
00:29:13,113 --> 00:29:15,707
General Chiang Kai-shek's
defeated army.

360
00:29:54,324 --> 00:29:56,486
How would you get
it into the States?

361
00:29:56,794 --> 00:29:58,591
You ain't got to
worry about that.

362
00:29:58,696 --> 00:29:59,822
Who do you work
for in there?

363
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,489
You ain't got to worry
about that, either.

364
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:04,464
Who are you, really?

365
00:30:05,035 --> 00:30:07,162
Frank Lucas,
says it right there
in my passport.

366
00:30:07,304 --> 00:30:09,000
I mean, who you represent?

367
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,131
Me.

368
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:16,075
You think you're going
to take 100 kilos of
heroin into the US,

369
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:20,174
and you don't work for anyone?
Someone is going
to allow that?

370
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,343
That's right.

371
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:22,613
He must be insane.

372
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:31,126
After this first purchase,

373
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:34,534
if you are not killed
by Marseille importers,

374
00:30:34,868 --> 00:30:37,268
or their people in the States,

375
00:30:37,738 --> 00:30:39,706
then what?

376
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,332
Then there will be more,
much more, I guarantee it.

377
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:48,676
And if it's all the same
to you, I don't wanna have to
drag my ass up here no more.

378
00:30:48,816 --> 00:30:50,374
Of course not.

379
00:30:53,155 --> 00:30:54,315
My man.

380
00:30:55,224 --> 00:30:57,124
Soul brother, huh?
Soul brother.

381
00:31:39,605 --> 00:31:44,167
Fifty grand. It's gonna cover
them and the pilot and
the boys on the other end.

382
00:31:44,911 --> 00:31:46,378
Give them a hundred.

383
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,215
Fifty is gonna
cover it, Frank.

384
00:31:49,316 --> 00:31:52,012
Give them a hundred,
give them the
whole thing. Here.

385
00:31:52,152 --> 00:31:53,414
And look,

386
00:31:54,321 --> 00:31:58,690
that's all I got.
So, if that dope don't arrive
for any reason...

387
00:32:02,063 --> 00:32:06,056
Hey, listen, cousin or
no cousin, I'm
a busy man, all right?

388
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:09,398
I ain't got no time
to be going
to nobody's funeral.

389
00:32:09,904 --> 00:32:12,031
I'll let you know
when it's in the air.

390
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,699
My man.

391
00:32:27,824 --> 00:32:29,155
Fuck.

392
00:32:37,635 --> 00:32:38,728
JAY. ; Richie?
Yeah.

393
00:32:38,837 --> 00:32:39,963
This fucking guy made me.

394
00:32:40,105 --> 00:32:41,936
I don't know how he did,
but he did.

395
00:32:42,641 --> 00:32:43,903
He went for his gun.

396
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:45,742
I had to do it, man.

397
00:32:45,844 --> 00:32:47,744
There's 100 people
out there that heard
the shots.

398
00:32:47,846 --> 00:32:49,973
You gotta help me.
You gotta do something.

399
00:32:50,149 --> 00:32:51,811
WOMAN: Baby.

400
00:32:51,951 --> 00:32:52,975
Where are you, Jay?

401
00:32:54,387 --> 00:32:56,014
That's the problem.

402
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:02,788
Dispatch, I got a 10-13.
I got a 10-13.

403
00:33:02,896 --> 00:33:04,865
Copy that. What's your 20?

404
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:06,630
Tower two.

405
00:33:08,335 --> 00:33:09,962
Apartment 1G.

406
00:33:10,671 --> 00:33:12,468
Kent and West in the projects.

Identify yourself, please.

Detective Richie Roberts.

409
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,445
That's a negative.
I got no units in that area.

410
00:33:18,547 --> 00:33:19,878
Bullshit.

411
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,675
Please put the call out again.
I'm gonna need assistance.

412
00:33:22,818 --> 00:33:24,877
Detective Roberts,
I got no units in that area.

413
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,817
That's a negative.

414
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,997
I didn't mention no cops.
Know what I'm saying?

415
00:33:39,168 --> 00:33:40,329
You know what I'm saying?

416
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:42,564
MAN 1: I'll get

420
00:33:56,054 --> 00:34:00,150
Hey, hey, be cool.
Be cool, all right?

421
00:34:00,258 --> 00:34:02,590
I'll find out what's
going on in here.

422
00:34:11,437 --> 00:34:12,769
JAY: Richie.

00:34:18,279 --> 00:34:19,337
MAN: Open the door!

424
00:34:19,447 --> 00:34:21,074

MAN: You
motherfucking cracker!

427
00:34:23,985 --> 00:34:26,453
You got no backup?
Why is that?

428
00:34:26,587 --> 00:34:28,282
MAN: You gotta come
out sometime, motherfucker!

429
00:34:29,957 --> 00:34:31,152
Bandage his neck.

430
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,386
Richie, he's dead.

431
00:34:32,494 --> 00:34:33,961
I know he's
fucking dead, right.

432
00:34:34,062 --> 00:34:35,825
Bandage his neck,
clean up his head,

433
00:34:35,931 --> 00:34:38,297
prop him up on the gurney
so he's sitting and
open his fucking eyes.

You guys ready?
Uh-huh.

Okay. Just keep
moving forward.

448
00:35:12,704 --> 00:35:14,672
You all right?
Yeah.

449
00:35:15,974 --> 00:35:17,737
It's okay! It's okay!

450
00:35:18,176 --> 00:35:19,837
We're taking him
to the hospital.

451
00:35:19,979 --> 00:35:22,812
Everybody, step back!
Step back!

452
00:35:23,983 --> 00:35:25,280
He's all right.

He's okay.
We're taking care of him.

454
00:35:27,453 --> 00:35:28,920
Step back. Step back.

455
00:35:31,057 --> 00:35:33,686
Everything's fine.
Just stand back.

456

He's all right.

457
00:35:35,495 --> 00:35:36,792
He's alive.

458
00:35:37,898 --> 00:35:39,058
WOMAN: What happened inside?

459
00:35:39,166 --> 00:35:40,929
RICHIE: We're taking him
to the hospital.

460
00:35:50,211 --> 00:35:51,509
JAY: Thanks, man.

461
00:35:52,548 --> 00:35:53,879
Fuck.

462
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:57,318
That asshole pulled
a piece on me, man.
Can you fucking believe it?

463
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,887
He pulls a piece on a cop?

464
00:35:59,055 --> 00:36:01,580
I had to do it, man.
Kill or be killed.

465
00:36:02,459 --> 00:36:04,689
Fucking crazy world, right?

466
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,157
What the fuck were you
doing in the projects?

467
00:36:09,265 --> 00:36:12,429
Investigating stuff,
man, you know,

468
00:36:12,903 --> 00:36:16,168
just like you taught me.
Checking on guys,

469
00:36:16,273 --> 00:36:19,731
following things up,
putting the pieces together.

470
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:23,507
That guy was a dealer.
A fucking dealer.
Scum of the earth.

471
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:27,416
That guy didn't pull
a gun on a cop, Jay.

472
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:30,077
That guy pulled a gun
on a junkie,

473
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:31,621
a junkie who was
trying to rob him.

474
00:36:31,757 --> 00:36:34,191
What the fuck you say?

475
00:36:34,994 --> 00:36:36,859
What the fuck, man?
What are you doing, man?

476
00:36:36,963 --> 00:36:37,952
What the fuck is that?

477
00:36:38,064 --> 00:36:39,463
That's my fucking money, man!

478
00:36:39,565 --> 00:36:41,192
I earned this shit.
That's mine!

479
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,961
I earned it doing
good cop work!
What the fuck is this?

480
00:36:43,102 --> 00:36:44,797
Good cop work!

481
00:36:44,904 --> 00:36:46,496
You murdered a guy!
I earned it getting shot at!

482
00:36:46,606 --> 00:36:48,438
You murdered a guy!

483
00:36:49,009 --> 00:36:50,738
You murdered him,
you robbed his money,

484
00:36:50,844 --> 00:36:52,311
then you called me
to get you out of it.

485
00:36:52,446 --> 00:36:54,311
That makes me an accessory
after the fact, motherfucker.

486
00:36:54,448 --> 00:36:58,407
I'll tell you the facts, man.
Just write the report
the way I say it happened,

487
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:02,581
and then that's the way it is,
and that's how it will be.

488
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:05,119
I can't do that.

489
00:37:06,027 --> 00:37:09,895
I'm a leper because
I listened to you and
turned in a million bucks.

490
00:37:09,998 --> 00:37:12,763
No one will work
with me after that.

491
00:37:12,968 --> 00:37:17,098
I can get off this shit,
Richie. That's easy.

492
00:37:17,373 --> 00:37:19,307
Just write the report

493
00:37:19,408 --> 00:37:22,036
between us, as partners.

494
00:37:23,746 --> 00:37:25,271
I can't do that.

495
00:37:27,417 --> 00:37:28,441
Hey!

496
00:37:30,053 --> 00:37:32,147
Stop! Stop!

497
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,823
Fuck!

498
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:13,632
Open the trunk.

499
00:38:28,317 --> 00:38:31,844
PEOPLE ON TV. Peace now!
Peace now! Peace now!

500
00:38:31,954 --> 00:38:35,117
LBJ, how many kids
did you kill today?

501
00:38:35,992 --> 00:38:39,086
Get out, get out,
get out of Vietnam!

502
00:38:39,229 --> 00:38:42,096
Get out, get out,
get out of Vietnam!

503
00:38:42,232 --> 00:38:45,463
MAN ON TV. ;... as loud as
we can that the Vietnam War
should stop,

504
00:38:45,602 --> 00:38:48,799
and that the best way
to stop it is for
the United States

505
00:38:48,939 --> 00:38:51,636
to simply pack up
and get out of
Vietnam right now.

506
00:38:57,582 --> 00:38:59,072
FRANK: How we looking?

507
00:39:02,086 --> 00:39:05,716
Typically, what I see is
25% to 45% pure.

508
00:39:05,825 --> 00:39:08,988
I mean, there's
no adulterants, no alkaloids,
no dilutants.

509
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:11,991
It's 100%.

510
00:39:16,469 --> 00:39:17,562
May I?

511
00:39:17,672 --> 00:39:18,969
Take it with you.

512
00:39:20,174 --> 00:39:21,266
Thank you, Frank.

513
00:41:18,102 --> 00:41:22,267
I'll take it.
No contingencies,
no loans, no nothing.

514
00:41:23,275 --> 00:41:24,435
Cash.

515
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:26,877
Fabulous.

516
00:41:31,516 --> 00:41:35,715
I'm not talking about
your proclivities, Richie.
Those I only know too well.

517
00:41:36,022 --> 00:41:38,081
I'm talking about being a cop.

518
00:41:38,191 --> 00:41:40,716
RICHIE: You're talking
about taking money?

519
00:41:40,827 --> 00:41:42,055
I don't do that.
It's not my thing.

520
00:41:42,161 --> 00:41:43,651
What about your friends
from the neighborhood?

521
00:41:43,763 --> 00:41:45,925
Do you still hang out
with them?
Yeah.

522
00:41:46,033 --> 00:41:47,295
Play baseball
on the weekends.

523
00:41:47,434 --> 00:41:49,834
Wise guys?
That's gonna look good.

524
00:41:50,304 --> 00:41:52,636
Guys I went to
high school with.
So what?

525
00:41:52,806 --> 00:41:54,774
What about Joseph Sodano?

526
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,136
What about him?

527
00:41:57,277 --> 00:41:59,974
Richie, I'm just trying
to understand things
your wife has said.

528
00:42:00,081 --> 00:42:01,412
If they're not true, tell me.

529
00:42:01,516 --> 00:42:03,074
Yeah, he's one of them.

530
00:42:03,218 --> 00:42:05,482
Is he also your
son's godfather?
Yeah.

531
00:42:05,787 --> 00:42:07,516
He's definitely fucking her.

532
00:42:07,822 --> 00:42:12,317
Do you really care about this?
Or do you just not
want her to win ever?

533
00:42:16,232 --> 00:42:19,497
You know, there's
an interview room
on the second floor.

534
00:42:19,635 --> 00:42:21,796
That's what I thought.
The door only locks
from the inside.

535
00:42:21,904 --> 00:42:23,338
All rise.

536
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:33,774
Oh, God, Richie.
Richie, fuck me like a cop,
not a lawyer!

537
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:44,855
SHEILA: Don't answer it!

538
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:51,828
Yeah?

539
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,911
Richie Roberts.
Hey, Norm?

540
00:43:10,691 --> 00:43:11,680
Hey. Richie Roberts.

541
00:43:11,792 --> 00:43:12,850
Hi. Detective Norman Reily.

542
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,327
Hey, Norm. How are you?
Good.

543
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:17,591
So, is that him?
Yeah.

544
00:43:25,641 --> 00:43:29,372
Picked a nice night to
come out, huh? It's like
Grand Central around here.

545
00:43:29,479 --> 00:43:31,071
It's been like this.

546
00:43:31,214 --> 00:43:35,548
I'm lucky if I get home
by midnight. It's like
nothing we've seen before.

547
00:43:40,424 --> 00:43:42,358
Something I gotta sign?

548
00:43:42,459 --> 00:43:44,359
REILY: Yeah. It's right here.

549
00:43:44,461 --> 00:43:46,929
I'm taking this with me.
I'll register it with
Essex County, all right?

550
00:43:47,064 --> 00:43:48,622
REILY: All right.

551
00:43:50,735 --> 00:43:56,367
America's public enemy
number one in the
United States is drug abuse.

552
00:43:57,775 --> 00:43:59,709
In order to fight and
defeat this enemy,

553
00:43:59,811 --> 00:44:04,613
it is necessary to wage a new,
all-out offensive.

554
00:44:04,984 --> 00:44:07,646
REPORTER. ; Federal authorities
have announced their intention

555
00:44:07,786 --> 00:44:10,255
to establish special
narcotics bureaus

556
00:44:10,357 --> 00:44:13,121
in Washington, New York,
Los Angeles, Chicago...

557
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,957
A detective without
the support of his
fellow detectives

558
00:44:16,063 --> 00:44:18,054
really can't do much.

559
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:21,396
You know why I don't have it.

560
00:44:22,503 --> 00:44:24,903
Doesn't matter.
You did what you had to do.

561
00:44:25,606 --> 00:44:29,134
Greatest city in the world!
And it's turning into
an open sewer.

562
00:44:29,678 --> 00:44:32,943
Everybody's stealing, dealing.

563
00:44:34,383 --> 00:44:37,750
Look at you.
You can't work because
you did your job.

564
00:44:37,853 --> 00:44:41,255
Good news is,
you're not the only
honest cop in town.

565
00:44:41,357 --> 00:44:45,919
The special narcotics bureau
in Washington is not
a dog and pony show.

566
00:44:46,196 --> 00:44:49,597
They are sincere. I know
this because they want
us to orchestrate it.

567
00:44:49,699 --> 00:44:52,190
And I want you to
head up things
here on our end.

568
00:44:52,335 --> 00:44:54,270
If it's federal,
who do I answer to,
the post office?

569
00:44:54,405 --> 00:44:55,667
No, you answer to me,

570
00:44:55,806 --> 00:44:58,206
me and the US Attorney,
nobody else.

571
00:45:00,177 --> 00:45:02,372
You never step foot
in a police station again.

572
00:45:02,479 --> 00:45:05,472
You work out of
your own place, you pick
your own guys,

573
00:45:05,584 --> 00:45:08,711
guys that you know
would not take a nickel
off the sidewalk.

574
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:35,962
Well, we got
the lovely transit.

575
00:45:38,034 --> 00:45:40,969
600-year-old
mahogany doors.

576
00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:46,838
Now, look at that.
Can't you just feel it?

577
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:49,605
I think it's lovely.

578
00:45:49,715 --> 00:45:51,808
Watch your step.

579
00:45:56,055 --> 00:45:58,421
Look at these
beautiful floors.

580
00:45:58,524 --> 00:46:00,515
At least, I don't know,
200 years old.

581
00:46:00,627 --> 00:46:02,561
And it's hard to
get the cracks...

582
00:46:02,662 --> 00:46:04,493
Now this was one of
my favorite rooms

583
00:46:04,597 --> 00:46:06,656
but we had some
problems with
the plumbing.

584
00:46:06,766 --> 00:46:08,200
I even fixed it.
I know it works.

585
00:46:08,302 --> 00:46:09,701
It's not gonna leak.

586
00:46:13,574 --> 00:46:15,872
Here it is.

587
00:46:22,584 --> 00:46:25,011
You know, I used to be a really good piano player
when I was a kid,

588
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,953
but then, I don't
know why I forgot.

589
00:46:28,723 --> 00:46:30,520
Life goes on. Well...

590
00:46:33,262 --> 00:46:35,992
How long are
you gonna be?

591
00:46:37,933 --> 00:46:39,025
Oh, and do me
a favor, please.

592
00:46:39,135 --> 00:46:40,193
Mind the doors.

593
00:46:40,303 --> 00:46:44,034
Those are beautiful,
ornate glass doors,
you know.

594
00:46:51,214 --> 00:46:52,772
Here we go, Jimmy.
Come on.

595
00:46:52,883 --> 00:46:54,942
Oh, yeah. Give it back.

596

00:48:01,575 --> 00:48:03,065
Look at this, baby.

619
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:07,203
(LAUGHING) Oh, my Lord!
I'm so glad to see you, boy.

620
00:48:07,514 --> 00:48:11,975
Oh, I'm telling you,
this is some piece of land
you got here!

621
00:48:13,287 --> 00:48:14,686
FRANK: I wonder what
the poor people
are doing here?

622
00:48:14,789 --> 00:48:16,154
MRS. LUCAS: And whose
house is that, Frankie?

623
00:48:16,257 --> 00:48:18,418
That is your house, Mama.

624
00:48:19,026 --> 00:48:21,187
Mine?
That's yours.

625
00:48:22,063 --> 00:48:23,724
And who else?

626
00:48:25,033 --> 00:48:29,163
BOY: Now, there, that's
my room right there, man.
Right over there.

627
00:48:35,444 --> 00:48:37,709
Anybody want some
more collard greens?

628
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:43,852
I wanna tell you how happy
I am to see all my
children at the table

629
00:48:43,953 --> 00:48:46,421
and the grandchildren
at the same time.

630
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:48,285
My heart's so happy.
Enjoy yourselves.

631
00:48:48,391 --> 00:48:49,882
Right on, Grandma.

632
00:48:50,628 --> 00:48:52,960
I hope you got a job, boy,
the way you're eating
over here.

633
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:56,931
That boy right there,
he got a arm on him. I mean,
a major league arm.

634
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:58,034
Oh, yeah?

635
00:48:58,135 --> 00:48:59,568
Ain't that right?

636
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:00,796
Right on, Pop.

637
00:49:00,905 --> 00:49:03,431
Well, we'll see after dinner.
We'll see him throw
it around a little bit.

638
00:49:03,575 --> 00:49:05,236
No, no, you can't
catch him, man.

639
00:49:05,343 --> 00:49:06,708
I'm talking about...
I'm talking about...

640
00:49:06,812 --> 00:49:08,474
This guy throw harder
than Gibson.

641
00:49:08,614 --> 00:49:10,878
We're talking
95 miles an hour.

642
00:49:11,284 --> 00:49:13,252
Can you catch him?
He gonna...

643
00:49:13,352 --> 00:49:14,877
He gonna catch the ground.

644
00:49:14,988 --> 00:49:17,650
We might've played catch,
I think, when I was
about five years old.

645
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:20,123
Since then, he ain't been
able to keep up.

646
00:49:23,163 --> 00:49:25,631
This is your room.
It's perfect.

647
00:49:26,634 --> 00:49:28,568
Oh. Why, it's...

648
00:49:28,937 --> 00:49:30,928
Will you look at this?

649
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:32,606
Oh!

650
00:49:33,341 --> 00:49:36,504
Oh, it's beautiful.
It's beautiful. It's just...

651
00:49:37,111 --> 00:49:38,100
I...

652
00:49:44,687 --> 00:49:46,177
How did you...

653
00:49:46,288 --> 00:49:47,516
I had it made.

654
00:49:49,525 --> 00:49:50,822
From memory.

655
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,122
You were five when
they took it away on me.
That's right.

656
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:54,390
How could you remember it?

657
00:49:54,498 --> 00:49:56,090
How could I forget, Mama?

658
00:50:00,804 --> 00:50:04,332
(STAMMERING) I'll just
tell you it is perfect.

659
00:50:04,909 --> 00:50:07,104
It's all perfect.

660
00:50:12,149 --> 00:50:14,811
I can't tell you
how much I love you.

661
00:50:14,919 --> 00:50:16,649
I love you, too, Mama.

662
00:50:17,422 --> 00:50:18,548
It's okay.

663
00:50:27,366 --> 00:50:29,392
SPEARMAN: Both these guys,
good with wires,

664
00:50:29,536 --> 00:50:31,128
they got solid informants,

665
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:33,728
and they're honest
and they're fearless.

666
00:50:34,274 --> 00:50:36,799
They're insane,
Richie, like you.

667
00:50:37,343 --> 00:50:38,833
Where are they?

668
00:50:41,047 --> 00:50:44,575
That's Jones with
the skinny white broad.

669
00:50:44,685 --> 00:50:46,346
Best I ever seen
on the street.

670
00:50:46,453 --> 00:50:49,981
He knows dope,
but he's together,
all right?

671
00:50:50,091 --> 00:50:52,491
He's a stand-up
guy all round.

672
00:50:52,594 --> 00:50:56,087
And that's Abruzzo
with the two fat black ones.

673
00:50:57,133 --> 00:50:59,658
He loves a big ass, man.

674
00:51:00,036 --> 00:51:04,370
He's a bulldog. He don't
fuck around, all right.
He's got a bit of a temper,

675
00:51:04,507 --> 00:51:07,875
yeah, but you can trust
this guy with your
grandmother.

676
00:51:08,211 --> 00:51:10,270
Listen, Richie.
We work together.

677
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:12,871
You want me,
you gotta take them, too.

678
00:51:25,029 --> 00:51:26,121
When do we start?

679
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:32,270
The man I worked for,
he had one of the biggest
companies in New York City.

680
00:51:32,371 --> 00:51:35,033
He ran it for more
than 50 years.

681
00:51:35,307 --> 00:51:39,038
Fifteen years,
eight months and
nine days,

682
00:51:39,144 --> 00:51:40,736
I was with him every day.
I worked for him,

683
00:51:40,879 --> 00:51:44,611
I protected him,
I looked after him,
I learned from him.

684
00:51:45,118 --> 00:51:47,746
Bumpy was rich,
but he wasn't white man rich,
you see?

685
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:49,321
He wasn't wealthy.

686
00:51:49,422 --> 00:51:51,754
He didn't own his own company.
He thought he did,
but he didn't,

687
00:51:51,891 --> 00:51:53,449
he just managed it.

688
00:51:53,593 --> 00:51:55,960
The white man owned it,
so they owned him.

689
00:51:56,097 --> 00:51:57,462
Nobody owns me, though.
Hey.

690
00:51:57,598 --> 00:51:59,532
How you doing, babe?
Good.

691
00:51:59,634 --> 00:52:02,262
That's 'Cause I own
my own company, and
my company sells a product

692
00:52:02,403 --> 00:52:05,031
that's better than
the competition,

693
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,633
at a price that's lower
than the competition.

694
00:52:09,411 --> 00:52:11,208
Well, what are
we selling here, Frank?

695
00:52:26,629 --> 00:52:28,655
How you doing, Red?

696
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,562
These are my brothers,
just got here from
North Carolina.

697
00:52:30,668 --> 00:52:31,726
Everybody, this is Redtop.

698
00:52:31,835 --> 00:52:33,234
Hello.
How you doing?

699
00:52:33,338 --> 00:52:35,772
FRANK: And the ladies.
LADIES: Hey.

700
00:52:35,874 --> 00:52:39,071
What wrong? Y'all niggas ain't
never seen hoochie before?

701
00:52:39,344 --> 00:52:40,470
TURNER: Why are
they all naked?

702
00:52:40,612 --> 00:52:42,341
FRANK: So they
can't steal nothing.

703
00:52:42,881 --> 00:52:43,905
Oh, right.

704
00:52:44,883 --> 00:52:49,583
The most important thing
in business is honesty,
integrity, hard work,

705
00:52:50,656 --> 00:52:51,987
family,

706
00:52:52,825 --> 00:52:54,918
never forgetting
where we came from.

707
00:52:55,161 --> 00:52:56,685
Thank you, Charlene.

708
00:53:01,802 --> 00:53:04,532
See, you are what
you are in this world,

709
00:53:05,005 --> 00:53:07,337
that's either one
of two things.

710
00:53:08,542 --> 00:53:10,601
Either you're somebody,

711
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,811
or you're nobody.
Be right back.

712
00:53:29,898 --> 00:53:32,196
I need these fresh.
'Cause if I have to come
back here and get you,

713
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:33,323
you know what it is.
FRANK: Tango.

714
00:53:33,435 --> 00:53:34,959
Don't y'all play that.
VENDOR 1: Yes, sir,
I hear you.

715
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:37,039
You won't have to come back.
There won't be no problem.

716
00:53:37,173 --> 00:53:38,697
VENDOR 2: What about you,
Frank? You need anything?

717
00:53:38,842 --> 00:53:40,901
Where's my money?
Redtop gave you the package.

718
00:53:41,044 --> 00:53:42,568
You're supposed to be
handing me my money.

719
00:53:42,712 --> 00:53:44,407
Here's a jar right here.
Twenty percent.

720
00:53:44,547 --> 00:53:47,141
Oh, you got the jar?
That's right.

721
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:49,552
Get the fuck out of here...
Oh! What you gonna do?

722
00:53:50,921 --> 00:53:53,412
What the fuck you
gonna do, Frank? Huh?
What you doing?

723
00:53:53,557 --> 00:53:57,857
You gonna shoot me in front of
everybody? Huh? Come on.

724
00:54:00,297 --> 00:54:01,560
Shit.

725
00:54:13,413 --> 00:54:16,246
There you go.
Twenty percent.

726
00:54:39,792 --> 00:54:41,623
So, what was I saying?

727
00:54:50,904 --> 00:54:51,871
Jones.

728
00:54:53,774 --> 00:54:55,469
Jonesy.

729
00:54:57,444 --> 00:54:58,877
That was nice, man.

730
00:55:00,313 --> 00:55:01,837
Just doing my
melodious thing,
baby.

731
00:55:02,015 --> 00:55:03,540
Got you.

732
00:55:10,375 --> 00:55:13,708
This is the newly formed
Essex County Narcotics Squad.

733
00:55:15,113 --> 00:55:18,675
Our mandate is to
make major arrests.
No street guys.

734
00:55:19,752 --> 00:55:22,846
We're looking for
the suppliers and
the distributors.

735
00:55:22,955 --> 00:55:26,083
Heroin, cocaine, amphetamines.
No grass under 1,000 pounds.

736
00:55:26,225 --> 00:55:27,921
No powder under 40 kilograms.

737
00:55:28,061 --> 00:55:29,995
Any less than that,
then somebody else
can waste their time.

738
00:55:30,096 --> 00:55:33,827
We gonna be handling the
big shipments, the big money
and the big temptation.

739
00:55:33,933 --> 00:55:35,161
JONES: I heard
a story about you.

740
00:55:35,268 --> 00:55:38,032
That you found
a million dollars in
unmarked cash

741
00:55:38,138 --> 00:55:40,937
and gave that shit back.
Is that true?

742
00:55:41,609 --> 00:55:44,772
Yeah, I did.
Anybody got a
problem with that?

743
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:50,843
So do I, you know?
I think about it every day.

744
00:55:50,952 --> 00:55:53,922
I should be down in South
Florida with a 68-foot cruiser
doing fishing charters.

745
00:55:54,056 --> 00:55:55,080
MAN: You and me, both.

746
00:55:55,191 --> 00:55:58,388
But you know,
I didn't, so here I am,

747
00:55:58,494 --> 00:56:00,894
and we'll be looking to land
other kind of sharks.

748
00:56:28,526 --> 00:56:30,586
All right?
ABRUZZO: Bingo.

749
00:56:53,787 --> 00:56:55,915
JONES: See that, Richie?
Yeah.

750
00:56:56,023 --> 00:56:58,958
And this stuff is
your everyday stuff.

751
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:01,927
But this Blue Magic,
twice the potency.

752
00:57:02,063 --> 00:57:06,727
I mean, it's the purest thing
I ever seen in the streets.
It's strong enough to smoke.

753
00:57:06,868 --> 00:57:09,804
And that's for those
white suburban kids who
are scared of needles.

754
00:57:09,905 --> 00:57:11,566
ABRUZZO: I paid 10
bucks for that.

755
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,468
And it's everywhere.
I mean, it's on every
corner out there.

756
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:16,339
So, how is that possible?

757
00:57:16,445 --> 00:57:19,882
Who can afford to sell
shit twice as good
for half as much?

758
00:57:28,025 --> 00:57:30,391
Hey, man. Frankie,
baby, good to see you!

759
00:57:30,494 --> 00:57:31,426
Everything's good?

760
00:57:31,562 --> 00:57:32,689
Yeah, man, just got back
from Europe,

761
00:57:32,797 --> 00:57:35,322
over there for two months,
south of France, man.

762
00:57:38,103 --> 00:57:41,903
PHOTOGRAPHER 1:
Look right, look right.
Wonderful, wonderful.

763
00:57:43,975 --> 00:57:45,443
PHOTOGRAPHER 2: Nicky!

764
00:57:46,913 --> 00:57:48,107
PHOTOGRAPHER 3:
Give us a smile, Nicky.

765
00:57:48,247 --> 00:57:49,441
PHOTOGRAPHER 4:
Show us the cover.

766
00:57:49,582 --> 00:57:50,742
You know what
I'm saying, man?

767
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:52,112
PHOTOGRAPHER 5:
Hey, Nicky, over here.

768
00:57:52,251 --> 00:57:53,582
There you go.

769
00:57:55,955 --> 00:57:57,287
Nicky!

770
00:57:58,959 --> 00:58:01,757
Who is that?
Look at you, my man.

771
00:58:10,271 --> 00:58:11,295
All right.

772
00:58:11,439 --> 00:58:12,929
LEAD SINGER. ;
Ladies and gentlemen,

773
00:58:13,074 --> 00:58:15,736
the Brown Bomber! The champ!

774
00:58:15,843 --> 00:58:17,470
Mr. Joe Louis!

775
00:58:26,589 --> 00:58:28,147
Who's that with Joe?

776
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:30,390
Miss Puerto Rico.

777
00:58:30,492 --> 00:58:32,119
Puerto Rico?
Mmm-hmm.

778
00:58:32,261 --> 00:58:33,387
Is she a beauty queen?

779
00:58:33,495 --> 00:58:35,589
For real. The beauty queen.

780
00:58:59,858 --> 00:59:02,691
Welcome.
My main man. My main man.

781
00:59:07,967 --> 00:59:09,434
Can you all excuse us
for a minute, please?

782
00:59:09,535 --> 00:59:10,593
MAN: Yeah, sure, Frank.

783
00:59:10,703 --> 00:59:12,399
Yes, sir.

784
00:59:13,474 --> 00:59:14,907
Thank you.

785
00:59:18,712 --> 00:59:20,111
What's going on?

786
00:59:20,214 --> 00:59:21,909
What you smiling about?
I don't know.

787
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:24,645
What is this? Huh?
What's what?

788
00:59:24,786 --> 00:59:26,845
What's what?
Come here.

789
00:59:28,456 --> 00:59:29,753
What is that you got on?

790
00:59:29,858 --> 00:59:31,416
What's what, man?

791
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,460
Yeah, that! What you got on.

792
00:59:33,561 --> 00:59:34,823
This is a very,
very, very nice suit.

793
00:59:34,963 --> 00:59:38,263
That's a very, very, very
nice suit, huh? That's a clown
suit. That's a costume...

794
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:41,200
that says "Arrest Me."

795
00:59:41,337 --> 00:59:42,463
You understand?
You're too loud.

796
00:59:42,571 --> 00:59:44,436
You're making too much noise.
Look at me.

797
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:49,034
The loudest one in the room
is the weakest one
in the room. I told you that.

798
00:59:49,179 --> 00:59:51,704
All right? What, are you
trying to be like
Nicky Barnes, now?

799
00:59:51,848 --> 00:59:53,315
What's your problem with
Nicky, man? I like Nicky.

800
00:59:53,417 --> 00:59:54,975
I ain't got no problem
with Nicky. Oh,
you like Nicky?

801
00:59:55,085 --> 00:59:56,347
Yeah!
You want to be like Nicky?

802
00:59:56,486 --> 00:59:59,148
You want to be superfly?
You wanna work for him?

803
00:59:59,256 --> 01:00:01,053
Share a jail cell with him?
Maybe cook for him?

804
01:00:01,191 --> 01:00:02,181
He wants to talk to you.

805
01:00:02,326 --> 01:00:05,193
Oh, so now you talking
to him about me?
What? You...

806
01:00:05,329 --> 01:00:06,853
About what? What is it about?
It ain't like that.

807
01:00:06,964 --> 01:00:08,226
Then what is it like?
We were talking,

808
01:00:08,332 --> 01:00:10,232
your name came up.
About what?

809
01:00:10,368 --> 01:00:13,394
I don't know, man.
I told him I'd tell you.

810
01:00:15,074 --> 01:00:16,564
You know... Boy, you...

811
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:21,072
You know, if you wasn't
my brother, I'd kill you.
You know that, don't you?

812
01:00:21,213 --> 01:00:22,908
I'd blow your
motherfucking brains out.

813
01:00:23,048 --> 01:00:24,037
Come on, man.
Don't be like that.

814
01:00:24,149 --> 01:00:25,446
I'm taking you
shopping this week.

815
01:00:25,551 --> 01:00:27,383
I went shopping.
I can tell.

816
01:00:58,237 --> 01:00:59,898
It's a tax thing.

817
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:01,934
It's a mistake my lawyers
are straightening out,

818
01:01:02,041 --> 01:01:03,599
but for the time being...

819
01:01:03,777 --> 01:01:05,369
How much do
you owe, Joe?

820
01:01:06,646 --> 01:01:09,274
It's nothing.
It's like...

821
01:01:09,483 --> 01:01:10,609
Fifty grand.

822
01:01:12,452 --> 01:01:14,113
You got it.

823
01:01:15,155 --> 01:01:16,487
Thank you, man.

824
01:01:16,657 --> 01:01:18,022
Hey, I'm gonna pay
you back as soon as I...

825
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:21,526
Joe, this ain't no loan.
It's a gift. All right?

826
01:01:21,629 --> 01:01:24,189
All you did for Bumpy,
we owe you.

827
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:26,858
Keep your chin up.
All right? Okay?

828
01:01:26,968 --> 01:01:28,458
All you have which
is down there. Down.

829
01:01:28,569 --> 01:01:30,003
Chin down.

830
01:01:30,539 --> 01:01:32,598
All right. Doc, will
see you, okay?

831
01:01:36,645 --> 01:01:37,771
Hey!

832
01:01:39,548 --> 01:01:41,244
You still owe me
that dance, right?

833
01:01:41,351 --> 01:01:42,716
FRANK: Doc, come on.

834
01:01:42,819 --> 01:01:45,219
Frank, check this.

835
01:01:55,933 --> 01:01:57,560
How you doing?
Hi.

836
01:01:57,668 --> 01:01:58,657
Frank Lucas.

837
01:01:58,769 --> 01:01:59,758
Eva Kendo.

838
01:02:00,571 --> 01:02:01,663
Nice to meet you, Eva.

839
01:02:01,772 --> 01:02:03,706
Nice to meet you,
Frank.

840
01:02:04,742 --> 01:02:06,734
You're Frank and
this is your place?

841
01:02:06,845 --> 01:02:09,871
That's right.
I'm Frank and
this is my place.

842
01:02:10,815 --> 01:02:12,544
Why is it called
Small's?

843
01:02:12,717 --> 01:02:14,480
Why don't you
call it Frank's?

844
01:02:15,954 --> 01:02:19,482
When you own something,
you can call it
what you want.

845
01:02:19,625 --> 01:02:20,887
Small's.

846
01:02:20,993 --> 01:02:23,791
Or Frank's.
Frankie Small's.

847
01:02:24,363 --> 01:02:25,922
Small's Frankie.

848
01:02:27,434 --> 01:02:28,867
That's right.

849
01:02:29,369 --> 01:02:31,429
You want to let
my hand go?

850
01:02:32,941 --> 01:02:34,101
Okay.

851
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:36,568
You leaving?

852
01:02:36,678 --> 01:02:38,077
No, I was going
to my table.

853
01:02:38,179 --> 01:02:40,647
Okay. Need somebody
to go with you?

854
01:02:42,817 --> 01:02:43,978
Yes?
EVA: Mmm-hmm.

855
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:48,580
SPEARMAN: All the cheesies.

856
01:02:48,691 --> 01:02:50,420
Right here, here we go.
What have we got here?

857
01:02:50,526 --> 01:02:51,788
ABRUZZO: Wash your hands?

858
01:02:51,894 --> 01:02:53,088
I got one print of that,
don't smudge it.

859
01:02:53,195 --> 01:02:54,958
MAN: Yeah.
There you go.

860
01:02:55,582 --> 01:02:58,345
JONES: Hey, Spearman,
what about him?
Who is that?

861
01:02:58,451 --> 01:03:00,544
Joey Sodano.
Don Cattano's nephew.

862
01:03:00,686 --> 01:03:02,176
SPEARMAN: Yeah, yeah. Put him
up there by the big man.

863
01:03:02,288 --> 01:03:03,687
JONES: He looks
like your uncle, Abruzzo.

864
01:03:03,789 --> 01:03:04,915
Yeah, but he's not
as handsome.

865
01:03:05,057 --> 01:03:07,218
JONES: He looks more
like your sister.
MAN: Where's Ice Pick's mug?

866
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,350
ABRUZZO: Yeah, that's funny.

867
01:03:08,462 --> 01:03:09,690
Maybe you guys
should take that show
on the road.

868
01:03:09,796 --> 01:03:12,196
So we need Ice Pick Paul.

869
01:03:12,299 --> 01:03:13,664
ABRUZZO: Ice Pick Paul?
JONES: Yeah.

870
01:03:13,767 --> 01:03:15,234
SPEARMAN: There you go.
Get him up.

871
01:03:15,369 --> 01:03:17,929
ABRUZZO: Ice Pick Paul,
he goes way up there, up top.

872
01:03:18,071 --> 01:03:21,473
No, Ice Pick Paul,
he's a fucking soldier.
This guy's a lieutenant.

873
01:03:21,576 --> 01:03:22,736
How's that even
fucking possible?

874
01:03:22,844 --> 01:03:24,209
JONES: That's Benny
the Bishop.

875
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:28,943
That guy is a soldier.
This guy's a lieutenant.
No way that guy's on top.

876
01:03:29,083 --> 01:03:30,846
JONES: You thinking of
Benny the Bishop.

877
01:03:30,952 --> 01:03:33,854
Vinnie Two Socks is fucking
Cattano's deadbeat son-in-law.

878
01:03:33,956 --> 01:03:35,048
SPEARMAN: Jonesy's right.

879
01:03:35,157 --> 01:03:38,358
Hey, which one of you guys
has ever actually seen
Ice Pick Paul selling drugs?

880
01:03:38,393 --> 01:03:40,758
Actually seen it go down?

881
01:03:41,546 --> 01:03:42,444
Yeah, seen it go down.

882
01:03:42,614 --> 01:03:44,206
Been in his place.
Seen him handle drugs.

883
01:03:44,316 --> 01:03:46,217
That rat, Ricky,
has told us...

884
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:49,652
He's fucking dead.
About four weeks ago.

885
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:51,950
He's dead.

886
01:03:52,058 --> 01:03:53,047
SPEARMAN: (LAUGHING)
All right, well,

887
01:03:53,159 --> 01:03:54,319
we can take him off
the fucking board.

888
01:03:54,427 --> 01:03:58,865
I don't think we got
any solid evidence on
anybody on that board.

889
01:03:59,499 --> 01:04:00,864
What you saying, Richie?

890
01:04:01,034 --> 01:04:02,399
This is weeks and
weeks of work, man.

891
01:04:02,502 --> 01:04:04,163
I'm saying, take it down.

892
01:04:04,339 --> 01:04:06,000
We got to start again
from the street.

893
01:07:20,452 --> 01:07:21,976
Hi, who's this?

894
01:07:22,086 --> 01:07:25,420
Hello? Gabe?
Yeah, it's Scott.
Yeah.

895
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:28,058
Scotty! What's going
down, brother?

896
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,525
Those snow tires you
gave me last night.

897
01:07:29,695 --> 01:07:31,061
They come in yet?

898
01:07:31,164 --> 01:07:32,927
Oh, the snow tires?

899
01:07:33,099 --> 01:07:34,896
Yeah. I want some
more of them.

900
01:07:35,202 --> 01:07:36,226
Give me one-and-a-half
more.

901
01:07:36,403 --> 01:07:37,461
One-and-a-half,

902
01:07:37,571 --> 01:07:39,163
that's a pretty big order.

903
01:07:39,339 --> 01:07:40,966
Yeah, I want the
big whitewalls,

904
01:07:41,074 --> 01:07:43,441
they better get at least
100,000 miles.

905
01:07:43,544 --> 01:07:45,478
All right,
I'll tell you what.

906
01:07:45,646 --> 01:07:47,580
You come in here
tomorrow morning

907
01:07:47,715 --> 01:07:49,239
I'm gonna set
you up real nice

908
01:07:49,417 --> 01:07:50,975
with a whitewall special,
all right?

909
01:07:51,085 --> 01:07:52,052
Thanks, bro.

910
01:07:52,153 --> 01:07:53,177
No problem.

911
01:07:55,591 --> 01:07:59,186
That's considerably
more than one year's
salary, Richie.

912
01:07:59,628 --> 01:08:04,357
If it disappears,
I will not be able to
get it for you again.

913
01:08:05,884 --> 01:08:06,908
That's yours.

914
01:08:07,153 --> 01:08:11,453
Signing my life away again,
for a lousy twenty grand.

915
01:08:14,827 --> 01:08:16,351
It has to be
Blue Magic, right?

916
01:08:16,495 --> 01:08:18,463
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's gonna be Blue.

917
01:08:18,564 --> 01:08:19,623
You can pick it up
here tomorrow.

918
01:08:19,733 --> 01:08:20,825
RICHIE: $20,000.

919
01:08:20,934 --> 01:08:22,834
MECHANIC: Just leave it there.

920
01:08:36,718 --> 01:08:38,549
How'd you do?
Good.

921
01:08:40,588 --> 01:08:42,055
RICHIE: Here he comes.

922
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:43,623
That's him?
Yep.

923
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,519
That was quick.

924
01:08:58,174 --> 01:08:59,573
Richie, if he goes
in the city, what
do we fucking do?

925
01:08:59,709 --> 01:09:01,301
Stay with the fucking money,
that's what we do.

926
01:09:01,411 --> 01:09:02,469
We stay with the money,
all right?

927
01:09:02,579 --> 01:09:03,842
We can't go
in the fucking city.

928
01:09:03,948 --> 01:09:05,745
Yes, we can.
That's 20 grand
in there, all right,

929
01:09:05,883 --> 01:09:07,817
that I'm responsible for.
I ain't losing it.

930
01:09:07,918 --> 01:09:09,511
SPEARMAN: It's out
of our jurisdiction!

931
01:09:09,621 --> 01:09:12,055
RICHIE: Follow the money!
SPEARMAN: All right,
all right, all right!

932
01:09:26,923 --> 01:09:28,185
RICHIE: He's pulling over.

933
01:09:28,291 --> 01:09:30,350
SPEARMAN:
All right, here we go.

934
01:09:30,459 --> 01:09:31,790
RICHIE: Let me out here.

935
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:35,993
RICHIE:
Don't disappear, all right?

936
01:09:36,265 --> 01:09:38,293
I'll circle the block.

937
01:09:38,702 --> 01:09:39,396
DRIVER: Move!

938
01:09:57,055 --> 01:10:00,355
Hey! Who's the fuck?
You gotta fucking move!

939
01:10:11,972 --> 01:10:13,462
Police Officer.
I'm commandeering

940
01:10:13,573 --> 01:10:15,006
your vehicle.
Get out of the car.

941
01:10:15,709 --> 01:10:17,700
Who the fuck cares
about you? This is
New York City, man.

942
01:10:17,811 --> 01:10:18,869
Get someone else's car!

943
01:10:18,979 --> 01:10:19,968
Get out of the car.

944
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,412
Come on, man.
Can't we live in peace...

945
01:12:30,506 --> 01:12:32,371
Frankie, Frankie! Sit down.

946
01:12:32,508 --> 01:12:33,873
MAN 1: What?

947
01:12:34,676 --> 01:12:37,304
Happy birthday, gentlemen.
How you doing, huh?

948
01:12:37,413 --> 01:12:40,974
He's about to do something,
huh? He's going bowling?

949
01:12:41,851 --> 01:12:43,375
Look at that. Strike.

950
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:44,714
Hey, what's between your legs?
What's in the bag?

951
01:12:44,854 --> 01:12:46,481
MECHANIC: Nothing.
Get up, you fucker.
Get the fuck up!

952
01:12:46,589 --> 01:12:47,647
MAN 2: Knock it off.

953
01:12:47,757 --> 01:12:49,088
MAN 3:
Shut the fuck up!
What did I tell you?

954
01:12:49,225 --> 01:12:50,317
MAN 4: Keep your
fucking head down.

955
01:12:50,427 --> 01:12:51,485
MAN 3: Shut up!
Whose bag is this?

956
01:12:51,594 --> 01:12:53,061
WOMAN: What're you doing?
MAN 3: Sit down and shut up!

957
01:12:53,196 --> 01:12:54,357
MAN 4: Don't you move!

958
01:13:06,578 --> 01:13:09,012
Hey, guys? Guys! Officers!

959
01:13:10,048 --> 01:13:12,778
Hey, I'm Richie Roberts,
from Newark.

960
01:13:14,553 --> 01:13:16,248
That's my money.

961
01:13:16,888 --> 01:13:19,881
What the fuck?
What money, huh?
What money?

962
01:13:21,094 --> 01:13:22,686
The bills are
sequenced, right?

963
01:13:22,795 --> 01:13:25,958
They're registered with the
Essex County Prosecutor's
Office. Just check them out.

964
01:13:26,099 --> 01:13:29,034
They all start with CF3500.
Have a look.

965
01:13:34,575 --> 01:13:35,701
Fucking registers.

966
01:13:35,809 --> 01:13:39,040
I thought I had a fucking
Chris-Craft sitting
in my driveway.

967
01:13:39,146 --> 01:13:42,081
Honest mistake.
I'll just get the money.

968
01:13:43,618 --> 01:13:45,643
This time.
All right.

969
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:48,585
There it is.
RICHIE: All right. Thank you.

970
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:51,454
When was the last time
I was in Jersey? Let me think.

971
01:13:53,628 --> 01:13:54,788
Never.

972
01:13:56,832 --> 01:13:58,891
What're you doing,
coming over here unannounced?

973
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:00,434
You don't think you could
get hurt doing that?

974
01:14:03,256 --> 01:14:05,520
You got your fucking
money, Richie.

975
01:14:06,559 --> 01:14:10,496
And never, ever
come into this city
again unannounced.

976
01:14:10,598 --> 01:14:12,964
You come in to see
a fucking Broadway show,

977
01:14:13,067 --> 01:14:16,195
you call ahead first,
see if it's okay with me.

978
01:14:17,538 --> 01:14:19,506
No problem. All right.

979
01:14:23,979 --> 01:14:25,207
MAN:
Let's go, hit some balls.

980
01:14:25,314 --> 01:14:26,508
RICHIE: Great suits, pal.

981
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:30,042
Is that your car?

982
01:14:30,552 --> 01:14:32,577
That's a fucking
great car.

983
01:14:32,688 --> 01:14:35,214
Have a nice fucking
trip back to Jersey.

984
01:14:35,358 --> 01:14:36,484
RICHIE: All right.

985
01:14:36,592 --> 01:14:39,083
Come on, I got
a tee time.
Let's go.

986
01:14:43,132 --> 01:14:44,827
What were you doin' there?

987
01:14:44,968 --> 01:14:46,630
Well, that's where this
dope is coming from.

988
01:14:46,804 --> 01:14:48,465
Blue Magic, it's coming
out of New York.

989
01:14:48,572 --> 01:14:50,164
What do you expect
me to do, ignore it?

990
01:14:50,274 --> 01:14:53,539
The cab driver has
filed aggravated assault
and grand theft charges

991
01:14:53,644 --> 01:14:55,009
which he may reconsider

992
01:14:55,112 --> 01:14:58,605
depending on how much
the State of New Jersey
offers to settle.

993
01:14:59,384 --> 01:15:02,182
I showed him my ID.
I told him I was a cop.

994
01:15:03,722 --> 01:15:05,986
You stole his cab
and you knock him out.

995
01:15:06,157 --> 01:15:08,421
I was chasing
the 20 grand,
all right?

996
01:15:09,194 --> 01:15:12,289
Next time, knock him out
before you show
him your badge.

997
01:15:14,066 --> 01:15:17,832
Look, I don't want to
hear about you going
into New York again.

998
01:15:18,804 --> 01:15:20,135
Well, then this
investigation's over.

999
01:15:20,306 --> 01:15:21,637
You're not
listening to me.

1000
01:15:21,741 --> 01:15:24,040
I said, " I don't want
to hear about you going
into New York again."

1001
01:15:24,144 --> 01:15:25,406
You do whatever
you have to do.

1002
01:15:25,579 --> 01:15:26,841
You go wherever
you have to go

1003
01:15:26,947 --> 01:15:29,507
to figure out
who's bringing this
shit into the country.

1004
01:15:29,616 --> 01:15:31,612
Just don't tell me
about it.

1005
01:15:36,491 --> 01:15:37,890
FRANK: There's your girl,
right there.

1006
01:15:42,664 --> 01:15:44,564
Hey, how'd you do?
Hi.

1007
01:15:44,666 --> 01:15:46,725
I didn't keep you
waiting long, did I?
No. Fine.

1008
01:15:46,835 --> 01:15:49,964
Good. A woman
as beautiful as you
shouldn't have to wait.

1009
01:15:51,041 --> 01:15:52,838
For anything.

1010
01:15:58,081 --> 01:16:00,880
Thank you, ma'am.
You as pretty as ever.

1011
01:16:05,523 --> 01:16:06,547
Hey, Doc.

1012
01:16:06,657 --> 01:16:07,624
Tommy!

1013
01:16:07,725 --> 01:16:09,989
Heard your boy scored
two touchdowns last week.

1014
01:16:10,094 --> 01:16:11,425
Sure. Sure do make
father proud.

1015
01:16:11,595 --> 01:16:12,961
All right.

1016
01:16:24,074 --> 01:16:25,838
This is your father?

1017
01:16:26,962 --> 01:16:28,793
That's Martin Luther King.

1018
01:16:29,798 --> 01:16:31,663
It is not. It is.
It is Martin Luther King.

1019
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:33,267
You know, "I have a dream"?

1020
01:16:33,369 --> 01:16:34,631
Of course.

1021
01:16:34,737 --> 01:16:36,534
No, that's...

1022
01:16:36,672 --> 01:16:40,165
He was just as important
as Martin Luther King to me.

1023
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:42,175
What did he do?

1024
01:16:42,312 --> 01:16:45,304
A lot of things.
He was a friend

1025
01:16:45,915 --> 01:16:48,679
and served New York.
New York served him.

1026
01:16:49,386 --> 01:16:50,979
He was my boss.

1027
01:16:51,255 --> 01:16:52,517
My teacher.

1028
01:16:52,656 --> 01:16:54,123
What did he teach you?

1029
01:16:54,258 --> 01:16:56,556
He taught me a
lot of things. He

1030
01:16:58,763 --> 01:17:01,197
taught me how to take my time.

1031
01:17:02,333 --> 01:17:06,327
Taught me that if I was
going to do something,
to do it with care, with love.

1032
01:17:07,239 --> 01:17:08,797
Anything else?

1033
01:17:13,245 --> 01:17:15,373
He taught me
to be a gentleman.

1034
01:17:15,515 --> 01:17:16,573
That's what you are?

1035
01:17:16,716 --> 01:17:18,877
That's what I try to be.
Come here.

1036
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:22,252
Come here. Sit right here.

1037
01:17:24,558 --> 01:17:25,718
Look at me.

1038
01:17:26,794 --> 01:17:29,855
I own about five apartments
in Manhattan.

1039
01:17:31,299 --> 01:17:35,292
Homes all over the East Coast,
I could have taken you to
any one of them, but I didn't.

1040
01:17:35,403 --> 01:17:36,495
I brought you here.
MRS. LUCAS: Frank,

1041
01:17:36,604 --> 01:17:38,003
I was looking for you, boy.

1042
01:17:38,106 --> 01:17:40,132
Because I wanted you
to meet my mother.

1043
01:17:40,242 --> 01:17:41,800
How you doing, Ma?

1044
01:17:41,911 --> 01:17:43,037
Is this her?

1045
01:17:43,145 --> 01:17:44,703
Eva, this is my mother.
EVA: Hi, Eva.

1046
01:17:44,814 --> 01:17:45,974
Oh!

1047
01:17:46,081 --> 01:17:47,446
Nice to meet you.

1048
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:49,177
She's beautiful!
FRANK: Yeah?

1049
01:17:49,285 --> 01:17:54,280
Look at her, Frank.
She's an angel come
down from heaven.

1050
01:17:54,424 --> 01:17:56,016
EVA: Thank you.

1051
01:18:03,733 --> 01:18:07,864
Mr. Roberts? I'm here
for our appointment.

1052
01:18:11,409 --> 01:18:13,240
Morning.
Morning.

1053
01:18:15,413 --> 01:18:17,314
Sorry. Our appointment?

1054
01:18:17,449 --> 01:18:19,610
Child Social Services.

1055
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:36,601
She did mention
your name, though.

1056
01:18:36,703 --> 01:18:37,863
The stewardess?

1057
01:18:37,971 --> 01:18:39,768
No, not the stewardess.

1058
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:44,136
The lady from Child Services.
She mentioned your name.

1059
01:18:44,311 --> 01:18:48,270
Right after she asked me
if I associated with
any criminals.

1060
01:18:48,382 --> 01:18:49,349
BOY 1: All right, go! Go, go!

1061
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:50,610
BOY 2: Yeah!
You wanna see this?

1062
01:18:50,718 --> 01:18:52,310
RICHIE: Hey, boys.

1063
01:18:52,453 --> 01:18:54,216
JOEY: Joey. Hey, Joey!

1064
01:18:54,321 --> 01:18:56,017
Get in the pool. Go on.

1065
01:18:57,225 --> 01:18:58,954
Come on. Come on.

1066
01:19:03,232 --> 01:19:04,961
So, how'd she get my name?

1067
01:19:05,368 --> 01:19:06,858
Laurie.
Hmm.

1068
01:19:07,838 --> 01:19:10,170
She's been saying
a lot lately.

1069
01:19:11,008 --> 01:19:12,202
A lot.

1070
01:19:16,046 --> 01:19:18,606
You know, when you asked me
to be your son's godfather,

1071
01:19:18,715 --> 01:19:19,876
I took it very seriously.

1072
01:19:20,018 --> 01:19:21,883
I know. I know and
I appreciate that.

1073
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:24,955
And I said yes,
I would take on
this responsibility.

1074
01:19:25,056 --> 01:19:27,616
Take care of your son,
if God forbid, something
happened to you.

1075
01:19:27,725 --> 01:19:30,626
Joe, the kind of things
she's saying to
Child Social Services

1076
01:19:30,728 --> 01:19:33,391
made me look really bad,
all right. You know,

Old friends like you, yeah.

1080
01:19:44,276 --> 01:19:46,507
Uncle Joey, watch me, okay?

1081
01:19:50,083 --> 01:19:51,675
Okay, I understand.

1082
01:19:51,785 --> 01:19:55,812
They ask me, I'll tell them
what you want me to tell them.
I'll lie for you.

1083
01:19:55,922 --> 01:19:58,084
No, don't lie.
You don't have to lie.

1084
01:19:58,225 --> 01:20:01,353
Just, omit certain details.

1085
01:20:02,096 --> 01:20:03,757
Sure. All right.

1086
01:20:06,133 --> 01:20:08,158
You know, there's something
else I was gonna ask you.

1087
01:20:08,269 --> 01:20:09,237
Something else.

1088
01:20:09,338 --> 01:20:11,363
You don't have to answer
if you don't want.

Blue Magic. Anything?

1090
01:20:17,913 --> 01:20:22,715
Just a lot of sorrow,
misery from guys getting
put out of work, that's all.

1091
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:25,014
What, your guys?

1092
01:20:25,121 --> 01:20:26,179
Just guys.

1093
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:30,688
You thinking about
where it's coming from?

1094
01:20:30,793 --> 01:20:33,455
Guys down south.
That's all I heard.

1095
01:20:34,098 --> 01:20:35,759

I don't know.

I don't know.

1098
01:20:40,505 --> 01:20:42,598
You're telling me,
it's coming in from
South America?

1099
01:20:42,741 --> 01:20:44,265
I don't know.

1100
01:20:45,143 --> 01:20:49,808
All I can tell you is whoever
it is, they're upsetting the
natural order of things.

1101
01:20:50,149 --> 01:20:52,242
And that's all there is.

1102
01:21:07,267 --> 01:21:08,291

How are you doing, Mr. Sobota?
How are you?

goddamn accident.

he's coked up all

go back home?

you talk to Huey! Huey,
you talk to me! You got it?

1165
01:24:53,947 --> 01:24:54,936
All right.

1166
01:24:55,048 --> 01:24:56,414
Damn it, never on the phone!
You got it?

1167
01:24:56,517 --> 01:24:57,745
I got it.
All right!

1168
01:24:57,852 --> 01:25:00,252
And take them goddamn
sunglasses off.

1169
01:25:00,354 --> 01:25:01,912
Take the goddamn
sunglasses off!

1170
01:25:02,023 --> 01:25:03,581

1178
01:25:46,739 --> 01:25:47,728
Pull!

1180

I'm sure you're dying
to see the rest of the house.

1181
01:26:02,689 --> 01:26:05,180
Of course. Excuse me.

1182
01:26:06,426 --> 01:26:09,361
Thank you for a wonderful
lunch. It was delicious.

1183
01:26:13,201 --> 01:26:15,328
What do you think
of monopolies?

1184
01:26:16,738 --> 01:26:17,898
You mean like the game?

1185
01:26:18,039 --> 01:26:21,668
No, I just think monopolies
were made illegal in
the country, Frank,

1186
01:26:21,776 --> 01:26:24,007
'Cause nobody wants
to compete, you know.

1187
01:26:24,113 --> 01:26:27,105
Nobody wants to compete,
not with a monopoly.

1188
01:26:27,249 --> 01:26:29,843
I mean, you let the
dairy farmers do that,

1189
01:26:29,952 --> 01:26:31,943
half of them would be
out of business tomorrow.

1190
01:26:32,087 --> 01:26:33,554
Just trying to make a living.

1191
01:26:33,655 --> 01:26:35,351
That's your right, I mean,

1192
01:26:35,558 --> 01:26:38,220
it's everyone's right.
It's America.

1193
01:26:38,595 --> 01:26:42,759
We just can't do it
at the unreasonable
expense of others.

1194
01:26:43,133 --> 01:26:45,226
'Cause then it becomes
un-American.

1195
01:26:45,335 --> 01:26:47,269
That's why the price
we pay for that gallon of milk

1196
01:26:47,437 --> 01:26:49,201
could never represent
the true cost of production

1197
01:26:49,306 --> 01:26:53,800
'Cause it's got to be
controlled. It's gotta be set.
It's gotta be fair.

1198
01:26:53,911 --> 01:26:56,402
Gotta be controlled by who?
I set a price that
I think is fair.

1199
01:26:56,514 --> 01:26:57,811
I don't think it's fair.
You don't?

1200
01:26:57,915 --> 01:26:59,382
I don't think it's fair.
I think it's fair.

1201
01:26:59,483 --> 01:27:01,452
I mean, I know
your customers
are happy, Frank,

1202
01:27:01,586 --> 01:27:04,282
bunch of fucking
junkies that they are.

1203
01:27:04,423 --> 01:27:08,917
But we fellow dairy farmers
out here, Frank,
are you thinking of us?

1204
01:27:09,628 --> 01:27:11,152
You thinking of them?

1205
01:27:11,496 --> 01:27:13,158
The dairy farmers?
Yeah.

1206
01:27:13,633 --> 01:27:18,400
I'm thinking of them, Dominic,
about as much as they've
ever thought about me.

1207
01:27:18,504 --> 01:27:20,837
I'm just thinking
out loud now.

1208
01:27:21,341 --> 01:27:23,832
If you took some
of your inventory, Frank,

1209
01:27:24,144 --> 01:27:26,477
and you sold it wholesale...

1210
01:27:27,682 --> 01:27:28,876
Sit.

1211
01:27:29,751 --> 01:27:33,243
We could work.
We could do some distribution.

1212
01:27:34,456 --> 01:27:35,684
I don't know.
I'm pretty good, Dominic.

1213
01:27:35,790 --> 01:27:39,727
You know, I got 110th,
155th, river to river.
I'm all right.

1214
01:27:39,829 --> 01:27:42,764
That's kind of a mom
and pop store next to
what I'm talking about.

1215
01:27:42,865 --> 01:27:44,492
I mean, let's go at
least bigger than Kmart.

1216
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:49,503
I'm talking about LA,
Chicago, Detroit, Las Vegas.
Let's go nationwide, huh?

1217
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:54,342
I'm gonna guarantee you
your peace of mind here.
You don't want that?

1218
01:27:55,729 --> 01:27:57,390
You're going to need it.

1219
01:27:58,031 --> 01:27:59,658
I don't know how
you view me, you know.

1220
01:27:59,767 --> 01:28:01,598
I'm kind of a
Renaissance man, Frank.

1221
01:28:01,735 --> 01:28:03,727
You know,
the people I deal with
on a daily basis,

1222
01:28:03,872 --> 01:28:05,669
you know, they're not
enlightened, Frank.

1223
01:28:05,774 --> 01:28:08,538
You talk to them
about civil rights,
they don't know, you know.

1224
01:28:08,643 --> 01:28:09,667
They're not open to change.

1225
01:28:10,445 --> 01:28:13,937
Not from the way things
are done and who's doing it.

1226
01:28:14,082 --> 01:28:17,416
I talk to them,
there's just no
misunderstandings.

1227
01:28:18,788 --> 01:28:21,780
And that's what I mean
by your peace of mind.

1228
01:28:26,462 --> 01:28:29,626
You're paying, what,
$75,000, $80,000 a kilo?

1229
01:28:31,802 --> 01:28:33,929
I'm a Renaissance man, too.

1230
01:28:35,105 --> 01:28:36,732
I'll consider $50,000.

1231
01:28:45,683 --> 01:28:48,914
Why would you trust
these people? And the
way they look at you...

1232
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:51,386
They look at me like
it's Christmas
and I'm Santa Claus.

1233
01:28:51,489 --> 01:28:54,152
They look at us
like we're the help.

1234
01:28:54,827 --> 01:28:56,658
They work for me now.

1235
01:29:01,668 --> 01:29:04,001
ALI ON TV. ;
I predict that when
I meet Joe Frazier,

1236
01:29:04,103 --> 01:29:08,404
this will be like a
good amateur fighting
a real professional.

1237
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:10,977
This will be like a kid
out of the Olympics...

1238
01:29:11,111 --> 01:29:13,477
MAN 1: That's gonna be
Ali in like three.

1239
01:29:13,614 --> 01:29:15,844
FRAZIER ON TV. ;
You're not fighting
Oscar Bonavena,

1240
01:29:15,983 --> 01:29:17,076
you're not fighting
Sonny Liston.

1241
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:18,209
You're fighting Joe Frazier.

1242
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,947
ALI. ; Everybody knows that.
That's not the point.

1243
01:29:20,055 --> 01:29:21,386
ABRUZZO: He's all talk, man.

1244
01:29:21,489 --> 01:29:23,753
SPEARMAN: Look at Frazier!
JONES: Ali gonna
crush him, baby.

1245
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:24,848
ALI. ; I'll stop him.

1246
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,257
FRAZIER. ; Stop me? You?

1247
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:27,623
COSELL. ; How soon? What round?

1248
01:29:27,729 --> 01:29:31,257
FRAZIER. ; Don't let him
obligate you.
ALI. ; One to 10!

1249
01:29:31,367 --> 01:29:36,202
MAN ON TV. ; Tonight, March 8,
1971. Here we are at
Madison Square Garden

1250
01:29:36,339 --> 01:29:37,806
for the Fight of the Century.

1251
01:29:37,907 --> 01:29:41,104
And by anybody's definition,
this is a happening.

1252
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:45,648
There are handshakes and,
of course, there are
utterly beautiful women.

1253
01:29:45,749 --> 01:29:47,910
But behind the smiles
and behind the handshakes,

1254
01:29:48,018 --> 01:29:52,318
you can feel the atmosphere
is so heavy with tension,
it's almost unbearable.

1255
01:29:53,090 --> 01:29:55,355
Everybody who is
anybody is here.

1256
01:29:55,493 --> 01:29:59,190
Like Sinatra. Like Graziano,
David Frost and
Diahann Carroll.

1257
01:29:59,430 --> 01:30:03,230
And Woody Allen and
Diane Keaton. The celebrities
are pouring in.

1258
01:30:03,368 --> 01:30:07,465
ALI. ; The way you all build
it up, Life magazine cover,
Time magazine,

1259
01:30:07,573 --> 01:30:11,566
everybody gives their opinion.
Dempsey says I'll lose.
Joe Louis...

1260
01:30:11,710 --> 01:30:15,077
And when Joe Louis said
I'm gonna lose, that's how
I knew I'd won this one.

1261
01:30:15,214 --> 01:30:18,183
Joe Louis always picks
the wrong man!

1262
01:30:18,284 --> 01:30:20,378
Always picks the wrong man.

1263
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:23,421
FRAZIER. ; Joe Louis is here
tonight. Watch your ass.

Oh.

1266
01:30:30,697 --> 01:30:33,599
ALI. ; Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

1267
01:30:33,935 --> 01:30:36,062
You're not watching
the fight, Bob?

1268
01:30:36,203 --> 01:30:38,069
I'm not into boxing.

1269
01:30:38,907 --> 01:30:41,205
RICHIE: This ain't
boxing, kid.

1270
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:43,005
It's politics.

1271
01:30:46,382 --> 01:30:48,009
I got something for you, too.

1272
01:30:48,117 --> 01:30:49,584

1293
01:32:17,715 --> 01:32:19,080

he's wearing green trunks.

1298
01:32:34,433 --> 01:32:36,493
Who's that laughing
with Cattano?

1299
01:32:37,170 --> 01:32:39,263
How'd he get so
fucking close to the ring?

1300
01:32:39,372 --> 01:32:42,466
The Heavyweight Champion
of the World,

1301
01:32:42,575 --> 01:32:45,510
Joe Frazier!

1302
01:32:47,847 --> 01:32:51,215
Hey, Frank.
You gonna keep that
hat on all night?

1303
01:32:51,351 --> 01:32:52,375
I'm gonna miss the fight.

1304
01:32:52,486 --> 01:32:54,215
You paid for it.

1305
01:33:39,470 --> 01:33:41,461
SPEARMAN. ; This guy,
he's a supplier at most.
Or just a pimp.

1306
01:33:41,572 --> 01:33:42,630
Otherwise we'd know his name.

1307
01:33:42,740 --> 01:33:46,574
His tickets were phenomenal.
Better seats than
Dominic Cattano. Right?

1308
01:33:47,211 --> 01:33:49,236
Joe Louis shook his hand.

1309
01:33:50,248 --> 01:33:52,274
Who the fuck is this guy?

1310
01:33:56,088 --> 01:33:57,454
What's this?

1311
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:59,785
That's the plate off the limo.

1312
01:33:59,926 --> 01:34:01,860
Check with the company
who rented it.

1313

She's the most beautiful

01:34:28,824 --> 01:34:31,088
That's my sunshine
right there, Mr. Williams.

1321
01:34:31,194 --> 01:34:32,422
I wish Bumpy had met her.

Come here, baby.

Detective.

1328
01:35:24,084 --> 01:35:27,349
So, you sure you done
the right thing? I mean, she's
beautiful girl and all...

1329
01:35:27,587 --> 01:35:29,714
Hey, hey, listen, listen.

1330
01:35:30,691 --> 01:35:32,716
Before you say anything
about me or about my wife,

1331
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:35,351
understand this is
the most important day
of my life, Detective.

1332
01:35:35,496 --> 01:35:36,987
Oh, I understand.
I understand.

1333
01:35:37,099 --> 01:35:39,533
You know, a man who
walks around in a
$50,000 chinchilla coat

1334
01:35:39,668 --> 01:35:41,863
and never even bought
me a cup of coffee.

1335
01:35:42,004 --> 01:35:45,168
There's something wrong there.
Pay your bills, Frank?

1336
01:35:46,576 --> 01:35:47,668
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1337
01:35:47,777 --> 01:35:48,801
Do you pay your bills,
I asked you?

1338
01:35:48,911 --> 01:35:50,139
If you're not getting
your share,

1339
01:35:50,246 --> 01:35:51,611
maybe you need
to talk to the
Chief of Police.

1340
01:35:51,714 --> 01:35:54,979
What's my share?
'Cause you don't even
fucking know me.

1341
01:35:55,886 --> 01:35:57,148
Maybe I'm special.

1342
01:35:57,254 --> 01:35:59,085
You are special.

1343
01:35:59,223 --> 01:36:00,850
TRUPO: You see

Ten grand.

Deliver it right here.

1349

unpretentious,
orderly and legitimate.

1375
01:38:35,692 --> 01:38:39,493
Has breakfast in a diner
in Harlem every morning,
usually by himself.

1376
01:38:39,597 --> 01:38:44,193
Then he starts work.
Takes a meeting with the
accountant or with his lawyer.

1377
01:38:44,302 --> 01:38:47,533
At nights, he usually
stays at home. And
if he does go out,

1378
01:38:47,638 --> 01:38:51,666
it's to one of two clubs
or a handful of restaurants
with his new wife.

1379
01:38:51,777 --> 01:38:53,608
Some ball players.
That's fucking
Wilt Chamberlain.

1380
01:38:53,745 --> 01:38:58,046
RICHIE. ; Friends, musicians.
Never, never with
organized crime guys.

1381
01:38:58,151 --> 01:39:00,915
Sundays, he takes
his mother to church.

1382
01:39:01,454 --> 01:39:02,945
Then he drives out
and he changes

1383
01:39:03,090 --> 01:39:07,083
the flowers on Bumpy's grave.
Every Sunday, no matter what.

1384
01:39:07,962 --> 01:39:10,760
TOBACK. ; Not the typical day
in the life of a dope man,
Richie.

1385
01:39:10,898 --> 01:39:11,956
RICHIE. ; No.

1386
01:39:12,099 --> 01:39:15,900
Bumpy Johnson's life
wasn't typical either, and
he ran Harlem for years.

1387
01:39:16,037 --> 01:39:19,564
TOBACK. ; So you're saying
that Frank Lucas replaced
Bumpy Johnson?

1388
01:39:19,708 --> 01:39:21,073
RICHIE. ; Yeah.
TOBACK. ; His driver?

1389
01:39:21,209 --> 01:39:23,734
TOBACK: Sounds RICHIE. ; Yeah.
A little farfetched.

1390
01:39:23,879 --> 01:39:26,404
RICHIE. ; But is it? Is it?
Because everything he does...

1391
01:39:26,548 --> 01:39:28,244
JONES: He's handing
out turkeys, man.

1392
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:30,181
RICHIE. ;... he does the same as
Bumpy would have done, right?

1393
01:39:30,286 --> 01:39:33,380
And who was Bumpy
most likely to teach?

1394
01:39:33,489 --> 01:39:35,548
The guy he sees every day.

1395
01:39:35,658 --> 01:39:37,956
It's like a Sicilian family.

1396
01:39:38,094 --> 01:39:42,156
He's structured his
organization to protect him
in the same way.

1397
01:39:42,266 --> 01:39:43,665
And if he was with Bumpy
for so long,

1398
01:39:43,767 --> 01:39:46,361
that means he would have
spent a lot of time
with Italians.

1399
01:39:46,470 --> 01:39:49,268
Definitely long enough
to learn that much.

1400
01:39:49,406 --> 01:39:52,808
But here's the thing.
I don't think it's Frank Lucas
that we're after.

1401
01:39:53,811 --> 01:39:57,301
Who we want is whoever
Frank Lucas is working for.

1402
01:39:57,948 --> 01:39:58,539
It's whoever's actually
bringing the heroin in.

1403
01:40:00,649 --> 01:40:02,641
Okay. So what do
you have on him

1404
01:40:03,421 --> 01:40:06,218
that will stick in court?
Because this isn't it.

1405
01:40:06,691 --> 01:40:10,525
Without powder,
without informants,
no one's going to jail.

1406
01:40:11,029 --> 01:40:12,189
RICHIE:
That's understood, sir.

1407
01:40:12,297 --> 01:40:15,698
And I don't think we're
gonna get informants,
not from inside the family,

1408
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:18,565
you know, unless we
get very, very lucky.

1409
01:40:22,375 --> 01:40:24,673
Straight up lab
tests suggesting

1410
01:40:24,844 --> 01:40:27,176
purity's consistent
with Asian dope.

1411
01:40:28,180 --> 01:40:31,241
The Italians, we know,
usually work with other
Europeans

1412
01:40:31,351 --> 01:40:33,285
or with the Turks.

1413
01:40:34,121 --> 01:40:36,647
We got small blue
packets turning up

1414
01:40:36,824 --> 01:40:39,384
in neighborhoods all
over the Tri-State area.

1415
01:40:39,827 --> 01:40:42,228
From Chinatown, to Harlem,
Washington Heights,

1416
01:40:42,331 --> 01:40:44,492
Richmond Avenue
and Staten Island.

1417
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:47,398
They got North Orange,
Princeton, Bayonne,
Newark,

1418
01:40:48,404 --> 01:40:52,033
Syracuse, Rochester,
Buffalo, and all the
way through Connecticut.

1419
01:40:52,141 --> 01:40:54,041
The same dope.

1420
01:40:57,380 --> 01:40:58,711
All right.

1421
01:41:03,235 --> 01:41:04,031
That's it, down there.

1422
01:41:48,718 --> 01:41:50,913
Okay, let's all join hands.

1423
01:41:55,258 --> 01:41:57,955
Lord, we thank You for this
food we're about to receive,

1424
01:41:58,062 --> 01:41:59,996
the nourishments
of our bodies.

1425
01:42:00,097 --> 01:42:04,500
Feed our souls with heavenly
grace, in Jesus' name
and for His sake.

1426
01:42:04,969 --> 01:42:06,698
Amen.
ALL: Amen.

1427
01:42:25,425 --> 01:42:27,052
MAN: Shh. Shh.

1428
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:30,254
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.
Come on, now.

1429
01:42:31,765 --> 01:42:32,891
It's okay. Shh.

1430
01:42:34,135 --> 01:42:35,796
You better get
yourself ready, old man.

1431
01:42:35,903 --> 01:42:37,962
Come on, big man.
Throw the ball.

1432
01:42:38,106 --> 01:42:40,438
Get yourself ready,
old man. All right!

1433
01:42:40,775 --> 01:42:43,573
Come on, now. Your pop said
you had an arm on you.
Come on!

1434
01:42:43,678 --> 01:42:46,203
I'm gonna set your ass
in the grass, Uncle Melvin.

1435
01:42:46,315 --> 01:42:48,875
MELVIN: Hey! Watch your mouth,
boy. Throw the ball!

1436
01:42:48,984 --> 01:42:51,817
STEVIE: Damn, Uncle Melvin,
I'm a pitcher,
not an outfielder!

1437
01:42:51,954 --> 01:42:53,979
Steve. Steve, come here.

1438
01:42:55,357 --> 01:42:56,381
Come, sit down.

1439
01:42:56,492 --> 01:42:58,585
Uncle Frank.
What's happening?

1440
01:42:59,529 --> 01:43:00,894
How you doing?

1441
01:43:00,997 --> 01:43:01,986
Cool.

1442
01:43:02,132 --> 01:43:03,429
You want a drink?

1443
01:43:03,533 --> 01:43:05,057
You know better than that.

1444
01:43:05,168 --> 01:43:06,465
Just checking.

1445
01:43:09,005 --> 01:43:12,237
Why didn't you show up
for that meeting, Steve?

1446
01:43:13,010 --> 01:43:16,104
I set it up with the
Yankees and Billy Martin.

1447
01:43:18,015 --> 01:43:19,983
Why didn't you show up?

1448
01:43:22,386 --> 01:43:24,014
Don't lie to me.

1449
01:43:24,623 --> 01:43:27,114
I don't want to
play ball no more.

1450
01:43:27,693 --> 01:43:28,785
I decided.
What you talking about?

1451
01:43:28,894 --> 01:43:30,759
You decided? Decided what?

1452
01:43:31,129 --> 01:43:32,187
(STAMMERING)
That ain't what I want.

1453
01:43:32,297 --> 01:43:34,697
What you talking about?
You've been playing since
you was a little boy.

1454
01:43:34,833 --> 01:43:36,165
You were ready to go
into the pros. What you...

1455
01:43:36,302 --> 01:43:38,600
Frank! We got a problem, man.

1456
01:43:41,974 --> 01:43:43,635
What do you want?

1457
01:43:45,144 --> 01:43:47,635
I want what you got,
Uncle Frank.

1458
01:43:47,747 --> 01:43:49,443
I want to be you.

1459
01:44:09,055 --> 01:44:10,716
He's been diluting
it so much.

1460
01:44:10,823 --> 01:44:12,484
We're down
2%, 3% pure.

1461
01:44:12,592 --> 01:44:15,084
And you tested it?
You're sure?

1462
01:44:15,195 --> 01:44:16,162
Yeah.

1463
01:44:21,268 --> 01:44:22,257
Fuck you looking at?

1464
01:45:14,909 --> 01:45:16,104
My man.

1465
01:45:16,612 --> 01:45:20,477
Welcome, Frank.
How you doing, Nick?

1466
01:45:21,266 --> 01:45:22,995
How you doing, Nick?
It's all great. Welcome.

1467
01:45:23,235 --> 01:45:25,260
I need to talk to you.
Great. Come on.

1468
01:45:25,370 --> 01:45:27,634
Hey, you all, everybody
get out! Let's go.

1469
01:45:27,806 --> 01:45:28,831
Come on! Hurry up!

1470
01:45:31,611 --> 01:45:33,977
Sit, my brother.

1471
01:45:35,449 --> 01:45:37,644
I take it you
talked to Charlie.

1472
01:45:38,819 --> 01:45:41,220
Guess you wanna hear more
about my Black coalition.

1473
01:45:41,323 --> 01:45:42,847
Let me explain to you...
No, no, no.

1474
01:45:42,958 --> 01:45:44,357
I'm all right.

1475
01:45:44,526 --> 01:45:45,891
That's not what I
came here for, Nick.

1476
01:45:47,262 --> 01:45:48,729
Yeah, everybody's
good, Nick.

1477
01:45:48,830 --> 01:45:51,856
You know, everybody's happy.
Charlie, Baz, the Italians,

1478
01:45:51,967 --> 01:45:54,027
you know, Johnny Law.
Everybody's happy
except you.

1479
01:45:54,136 --> 01:45:55,330
I'm happy, Frank.

1480
01:45:55,504 --> 01:45:56,698
You happy? Really?

1481
01:45:56,806 --> 01:45:58,433
Well, maybe I'm the
one with the problem.

1482
01:45:58,607 --> 01:46:00,268
Yeah, go on. Get one.

1483
01:46:00,376 --> 01:46:01,434
All right.

1484
01:46:01,811 --> 01:46:02,800
I gotta problem 'Cause

1485
01:46:02,912 --> 01:46:05,073
I don't understand
why you gotta take

1486
01:46:05,181 --> 01:46:07,275
something that's
perfectly good

1487
01:46:07,384 --> 01:46:09,079
and mess it up.

1488
01:46:09,319 --> 01:46:10,445
See, brand names.

1489
01:46:10,554 --> 01:46:12,646
Brand names mean something.
Understand?

1490
01:46:12,923 --> 01:46:14,584
Shut the fuck up!

1491
01:46:15,559 --> 01:46:17,117
Go ahead, Frank.

1492
01:46:17,227 --> 01:46:18,695
I'm sorry about
that bullshit.

1493
01:46:18,830 --> 01:46:20,195
Blue Magic.

1494
01:46:20,865 --> 01:46:22,492
That's a brand name.

1495
01:46:22,667 --> 01:46:24,362
Like Pepsi,
that's a brand name.

1496
01:46:24,502 --> 01:46:27,198
I stand behind it.
I guarantee it.

1497
01:46:27,338 --> 01:46:29,465
They know that,
even if they don't
know me any more than

1498
01:46:29,574 --> 01:46:32,135
they know the chairman
of General Mills.

1499
01:46:32,244 --> 01:46:33,541
What the fuck are you
talking about, Frank?

1500
01:46:33,645 --> 01:46:36,478
What I'm talking about is
when you chop my dope down

1501
01:46:36,582 --> 01:46:38,812
to one, two, three,
four, five percent

1502
01:46:38,984 --> 01:46:41,248
and then you
call it Blue Magic,

1503
01:46:41,353 --> 01:46:42,844
that is
trademark infringement.

1504
01:46:43,023 --> 01:46:44,513
You understand
what I'm saying?

1505
01:46:44,624 --> 01:46:47,115
With all due respect, Frank,
if I buy something, I own it.

1506
01:46:47,227 --> 01:46:48,489
No, that ain't true.
That ain't true.

1507
01:46:48,595 --> 01:46:50,825
If I buy a car, and I
wanna paint it, I can
paint the motherfucker.

1508
01:46:50,930 --> 01:46:52,056
Yeah, but you
don't have to.

1509
01:46:52,165 --> 01:46:53,655
This is what I'm
saying to you, Nick,
you don't have to.

1510
01:46:53,767 --> 01:46:55,200
Good enough the way it is.

1511
01:46:55,302 --> 01:46:56,701
You can make
enough money off it

1512
01:46:56,804 --> 01:46:58,101
the way it is, just by
calling it Blue Magic.

1513
01:46:58,205 --> 01:47:00,036
Anything more than
that is greed, son.

1514
01:47:00,141 --> 01:47:02,041
What you want, Frank?
You want me to change
the name on it?

1515
01:47:02,143 --> 01:47:04,134
I would have to insist
that you change the name.

1516
01:47:04,245 --> 01:47:06,145
Fine by me, Frank.
I'll call it Red Magic,

1517
01:47:06,247 --> 01:47:08,113
even though that
don't sound as good.

1518
01:47:08,216 --> 01:47:09,615
I don't give a fuck
what you call it.

1519
01:47:09,718 --> 01:47:11,083
Put a chokehold
on the motherfucker

1520
01:47:11,186 --> 01:47:13,814
and call it Blue Dog Shit,
you know what I mean?

1521
01:47:13,922 --> 01:47:18,155
I don't care, just
don't let me catch
you doing this again.

1522
01:47:18,261 --> 01:47:20,924
Catch me?
Infringement?
Insist?

1523
01:47:21,031 --> 01:47:22,828
I don't like these
words as much as,

1524
01:47:22,933 --> 01:47:25,663
"Please, thank you,
I'm sorry to bother
you, Nicky."

1525
01:47:25,769 --> 01:47:27,896
These are better
words you use to come
to my motherfucking club

1526
01:47:28,005 --> 01:47:30,565
without an invitation!
You hear me?

1527
01:47:31,575 --> 01:47:32,804
My man.

1528
01:47:41,419 --> 01:47:44,614
Oh, shit. Fuck, is that
the cops there, man?

1529
01:47:53,682 --> 01:47:55,274
It's all right.

1530
01:47:56,384 --> 01:47:58,876
The hell they're gonna do,
give us a ticket?

1531
01:47:59,388 --> 01:48:01,652
Stuff's in the car, Frank.

1532
01:48:03,559 --> 01:48:04,548
What?

1533
01:48:04,694 --> 01:48:06,821
Some of it's in the trunk.

1534
01:48:08,497 --> 01:48:10,295
How you doing, Frank?
I'm good. How you doing,
Detective?

1535
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:11,890
How was your Thanksgiving?

1536
01:48:12,035 --> 01:48:14,299
Not so good, as a matter
of fact. Why don't you
get out of the car?

1537
01:48:19,943 --> 01:48:21,001
Come on, give me
the fucking keys.

1538
01:48:21,111 --> 01:48:22,977
Where's the Shelby at?
The Shelby's gone?

1539
01:48:23,081 --> 01:48:24,844
The Shelby's gone, Frank.
Stay right there.

1540
01:48:24,949 --> 01:48:26,849
Yes, sir. Right here.

1541
01:48:27,919 --> 01:48:29,511
TRUPO: You got anything
worth looking at in here?

1542
01:48:29,621 --> 01:48:31,350
RICHIE: Hey, that's
that Trupo guy.

1543
01:48:31,456 --> 01:48:33,048
SPEARMAN: Is that him?
RICHIE: Yeah.

1544
01:48:33,191 --> 01:48:34,681
Fucking prick.

1545
01:48:37,863 --> 01:48:40,263
Come over here a minute,
Frank.
Yeah.

1546
01:48:42,534 --> 01:48:43,592
What are we gonna
do about this?

1547
01:48:43,736 --> 01:48:46,102
We don't do shit about it.
We close it up, throw
it back in the trunk,

1548
01:48:46,238 --> 01:48:48,833
everybody go home,
have some pumpkin pie,
warm apple cider.

1549
01:48:48,942 --> 01:48:50,739
I got a better idea.

1550
01:48:51,911 --> 01:48:55,245
Or would you rather me
throw you and your brother
in the fucking river?

1551
01:48:55,383 --> 01:48:58,045
Would you rather your
house blows up next time?

1552
01:49:02,624 --> 01:49:04,751
I loved that car.
I know.

1553
01:49:08,230 --> 01:49:11,290
RICHIE: What's he doing?
Shakedown!

1554
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,128
Somebody's getting some money
for the Benevolent Fund.

1555
01:49:14,270 --> 01:49:15,259
SPEARMAN: Look at that shit.

1556
01:49:15,972 --> 01:49:17,269
Sorry, Frank.

1557
01:49:17,407 --> 01:49:19,637
It's all right.
Go and get in the car.

1558
01:49:43,034 --> 01:49:45,798
RICHIE: All right,
you call me back.

1559
01:49:46,925 --> 01:49:50,984
INS, IRS, FBI.

1560
01:49:51,061 --> 01:49:51,823
I can't get a damn thing
out of any of them.

1561
01:49:51,895 --> 01:49:53,260
Because they all think
you're on the take.

1562
01:49:53,430 --> 01:49:56,092
And you think they are.

1563
01:49:56,199 --> 01:49:59,134
You know,
I don't think they
want this to stop.

1564
01:49:59,235 --> 01:50:00,827
I think it employs
too many people.

1565
01:50:01,606 --> 01:50:04,699
Judges, lawyers,
cops, politicians,

1566
01:50:04,875 --> 01:50:07,844
prison guards,
probation officers.

1567
01:50:08,546 --> 01:50:09,513
They stop bringing
dope into this country,

1568
01:50:09,613 --> 01:50:12,309
about 100,000 people
are going to be
out of a job.

1569
01:50:15,687 --> 01:50:18,656
Spearman.

1570
01:50:18,757 --> 01:50:22,124
FBI. Here to see
Detective Roberts.

1571
01:50:26,765 --> 01:50:30,429
So who took it out?
Somebody I know?
My wife?

1572
01:50:31,804 --> 01:50:33,466
Come on, if somebody's
taking a contract

1573
01:50:33,574 --> 01:50:35,201
out on my life,
I'd like to know.

1574
01:50:35,309 --> 01:50:38,904
I can't say without
compromising our source.
You understand?

1575
01:50:39,012 --> 01:50:41,413
No. Not when it's my life,
I don't understand.

1576
01:50:41,516 --> 01:50:43,006
If you want we can
assign someone to you.

1577
01:50:43,184 --> 01:50:44,742
FBI protection.

1578
01:50:45,653 --> 01:50:49,054
You know what?
My life is dangerous
enough as it is.

1579
01:50:50,391 --> 01:50:52,223
Well, we'll let you get
back to your business.

1580
01:50:52,328 --> 01:50:54,421
Okay. Larry, Bob.

1581
01:50:54,597 --> 01:50:56,758
Thanks for visiting
The Garden State.

1582
01:50:56,866 --> 01:50:57,992
Take care.

1583
01:50:58,100 --> 01:51:00,432
Hey, what do you know
about Frank Lucas?

1584
01:51:00,536 --> 01:51:03,937
We know that you keep
calling about him.

1585
01:51:13,650 --> 01:51:18,145
We believe that
peace is at hand.

1586
01:51:20,224 --> 01:51:24,661
We believe that
an agreement is
within sight.

1587
01:51:27,431 --> 01:51:30,595
As I said earlier...

1588
01:51:35,107 --> 01:51:36,074
Yeah.

1589
01:51:37,309 --> 01:51:39,243
Hey, Joey. Hi.

1590
01:51:41,180 --> 01:51:44,014
All right.
Yeah, tomorrow. Why?

1591
01:52:03,853 --> 01:52:04,751
RICHIE: What the fuck
is a microwave?

1592
01:52:04,888 --> 01:52:08,222
JOEY: It's a scientific force,
like atomic energy.

1593
01:52:08,359 --> 01:52:10,190
Yeah?
JOEY: Yeah.

1594
01:52:10,294 --> 01:52:12,421
It rearranges the molecules.

1595
01:52:12,563 --> 01:52:14,930
RICHIE: Of what?
JOEY: Of what? Of popcorn.

1596
01:52:18,103 --> 01:52:20,664
Of your head.
Stick it in. Go on.

1597
01:52:23,876 --> 01:52:25,901
I can get you one of those.

1598
01:52:26,045 --> 01:52:29,344
Brand new, just like this.
I'll have it delivered.

1599
01:52:29,749 --> 01:52:31,239
No, thank you.

1600
01:52:40,961 --> 01:52:42,986
Hey. Where is that?

1601
01:52:43,096 --> 01:52:44,928
Aspen. We just got back.

1602
01:52:45,633 --> 01:52:47,294
Had a great time.
You know who we met?

1603
01:52:47,402 --> 01:52:48,699
Who?

1604
01:52:49,404 --> 01:52:50,894
Burt Reynolds.

1605
01:52:51,306 --> 01:52:54,366
Yeah? Yeah?
Yeah. I'm not kidding.

1606
01:52:55,143 --> 01:52:59,080
A lot people from Hollywood
go up there now. They're
buying up everything.

1607
01:52:59,181 --> 01:53:00,808
This is your place?
Mmm.

1608
01:53:00,950 --> 01:53:04,784
You know what that's worth?
Ski in, ski out.
Five bedrooms.

1609
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:07,616
Sauna. Everything.
We were guests.

1610
01:53:12,762 --> 01:53:14,389
It's your place.

1611
01:53:29,513 --> 01:53:32,004
Isn't there
something we can do,

1612
01:53:33,852 --> 01:53:36,412
about leaving
the big guy alone?

1613
01:53:36,822 --> 01:53:38,756
You know who I mean.

1614
01:53:38,857 --> 01:53:42,418
I don't report what
you just said, I can
get in a lot of trouble.

1615
01:53:42,527 --> 01:53:45,496
I do report it,
then the trouble is yours.

1616
01:53:47,533 --> 01:53:49,831
I'm hoping you won't do that.

1617
01:53:50,670 --> 01:53:53,196
Richie, come on.
I'm not taping it.

1618
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:56,173
How do you know?
Because we're friends.

1619
01:53:56,510 --> 01:53:58,945
And I'm telling you,
this is a real offer.

1620
01:53:59,047 --> 01:54:00,947
From who? Your uncle?

1621
01:54:04,653 --> 01:54:07,144
Why would you do this?
Why would you risk
our friendship?

1622
01:54:07,255 --> 01:54:08,620
Because

1623
01:54:10,892 --> 01:54:13,191
I care what happens to you.

1624
01:54:15,264 --> 01:54:17,129
You shouldn't have done this.

1625
01:54:17,233 --> 01:54:20,293
I had to, I had no choice.
Neither do you. Richie!

1626
01:54:21,170 --> 01:54:24,971
You don't have a choice.
Just leave Frank Lucas alone.

1627
01:54:26,677 --> 01:54:28,110
Frank Lucas?

1628
01:54:29,346 --> 01:54:30,472
Yeah.

1629
01:54:33,150 --> 01:54:36,018
You tell Marie I had to leave.
I'm sorry.

1630
01:54:36,854 --> 01:54:38,321
Tell her why.

1631
01:55:21,235 --> 01:55:22,702
Don, t shoot! Don, t shoot! Talk! Talk!
Don't shoot!

1632
01:55:22,803 --> 01:55:25,101
Are you Richie Roberts?
Yes, so what?

1633
01:55:26,041 --> 01:55:27,872
You've been served. I'm sorry.

1634
01:55:42,626 --> 01:55:43,615
WOMAN: All right.

1635
01:55:47,631 --> 01:55:48,620
(WHISPERING) Laurie.

1636
01:55:50,769 --> 01:55:54,466
Look, I'm sorry I never
gave you the kind of life
you wanted, all right.

1637
01:55:54,606 --> 01:55:56,904
I'm sorry it was never enough.

1638
01:56:00,011 --> 01:56:02,639
Don't punish me
for being honest.

1639
01:56:02,781 --> 01:56:04,750
Don't take my boy away.

1640
01:56:07,119 --> 01:56:10,452
What are you saying?
That because you were honest

1641
01:56:10,589 --> 01:56:13,752
and you didn't take money
like every other cop,
I left you?

1642
01:56:13,859 --> 01:56:16,385
No, you don't take money
for one reason.

1643
01:56:16,496 --> 01:56:19,294
To buy being dishonest
about everything else.

1644
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:21,791
And that's worse
than taking money nobody
gives a shit about.

1645
01:56:21,935 --> 01:56:24,904
Drug money, gambling money
nobody's gonna miss.

1646
01:56:25,305 --> 01:56:28,764
You know,
I'd rather you took it
and been honest with me.

1647
01:56:28,876 --> 01:56:31,572
Or don't take it.
I don't care. But then
don't go cheat on me.

1648
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:34,773
Don't cheat on your kid
by never being around.
Don't go out and get laid

1649
01:56:34,882 --> 01:56:37,817
by your snitches
and your secretaries
and strippers!

1650
01:56:37,952 --> 01:56:40,683
I can tell by just looking,
she's one of them.

1651
01:56:40,823 --> 01:56:41,812
You...

1652
01:56:42,124 --> 01:56:46,424
You think you're going
to heaven because
you're honest, but you're not.

1653
01:56:46,829 --> 01:56:49,423
You're going to the same
hell as the crooked cops
you can't stand.

1654
01:56:50,699 --> 01:56:52,257
BAILIFF: All rise.

1655
01:56:56,673 --> 01:56:58,664
JUDGE: Please be seated.

1656
01:56:59,843 --> 01:57:01,538
Miss Dickerson,

1657
01:57:01,678 --> 01:57:04,169
before the court
renders its opinion,

1658
01:57:04,314 --> 01:57:06,977
is there anything else
you'd like to be heard on?

1659
01:57:07,084 --> 01:57:08,813
Yes, Your Honor.

1660
01:57:08,919 --> 01:57:12,048
Your Honor, a lot has
been said here today
about how unsavory

1661
01:57:12,190 --> 01:57:16,149
Mr. Roberts' environment
is for a child.
How dangerous it is.

1662
01:57:16,261 --> 01:57:20,028
We tell him to protect us.
We give him that
responsibility,

1663
01:57:20,166 --> 01:57:22,691
but then say, " Oh, we don't
trust you to raise a child.

1664
01:57:22,835 --> 01:57:24,359
"We don't think
you're fit for that."

1665
01:57:24,470 --> 01:57:26,062
I'm not.

1666
01:57:26,873 --> 01:57:28,340
You're right.

1667
01:57:29,542 --> 01:57:31,977
Being around me
is no place for a kid.

1668
01:57:32,079 --> 01:57:35,310
You take him to Vegas.
I'll come see him when I can.

1669
01:57:38,252 --> 01:57:41,881
Your Honor, I want
to apologize for wasting
the court's time.

1670
01:57:53,768 --> 01:57:55,464
FRANK: Doc.

1671
01:57:55,571 --> 01:57:56,970
I see them.

1672
01:57:57,072 --> 01:57:58,562
DETECTIVE: There he is.

1673
01:58:17,093 --> 01:58:18,720
The fuck is this guy doing?

1674
01:58:19,496 --> 01:58:20,828
DOC: Hey!
Champagne.

1675
01:58:20,932 --> 01:58:23,127
DOC: Merry Christmas,
Detectives.
For us?

1676
01:58:23,234 --> 01:58:25,065
DOC: Yeah. Enjoy that.

1677
01:58:25,436 --> 01:58:27,768
You fellas have a good time.
Mmm-hmm.

1678
01:58:29,173 --> 01:58:30,731
It's Cristal.

1679
01:58:34,580 --> 01:58:36,878
MAN ON TV. ; South Vietnamese
troops called in air strikes

1680
01:58:36,982 --> 01:58:39,917
on Communist positions
inside the city.

1681
01:58:41,420 --> 01:58:44,116
Paying off Johnny Law,
that's one thing.

1682
01:58:44,223 --> 01:58:45,816
There ain't no problem
with that.

1683
01:58:45,925 --> 01:58:48,621
I've been paying off
the police since I
was 10 years old.

1684
01:58:48,728 --> 01:58:51,391
Put more of their kids
through college than
the National Merit Award.

1685
01:58:51,532 --> 01:58:53,295
Give me one of
them round one... Yeah.

1686
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:55,334
This is different,
though. These...

1687
01:58:55,436 --> 01:58:59,339
Special Investigative Unit.
That's their problem.
They think they're special.

1688
01:58:59,441 --> 01:59:02,069
Fucking crooks.
No code of ethics.

1689
01:59:02,210 --> 01:59:03,234
What do you think?

1690
01:59:03,345 --> 01:59:05,472
Looks great. It's beautiful.

1691
01:59:05,780 --> 01:59:06,906
Good.

1692
01:59:07,515 --> 01:59:09,574
The police, that ain't
the only somebody
I'm worried about.

1693
01:59:09,684 --> 01:59:12,654
I seeing cars where I ain't
never seen them before,
people I don't know.

1694
01:59:12,788 --> 01:59:13,755
Yeah, me, too.

1695
01:59:17,443 --> 01:59:18,637
EVA: Ho, ho, ho.

1696
01:59:18,744 --> 01:59:19,836
Merry Christmas,
Charlie.

1697
01:59:19,945 --> 01:59:21,207
Thank you.

1698
01:59:21,380 --> 01:59:22,678
I love you.

1699
01:59:24,184 --> 01:59:26,015
I love you, too.

1700
01:59:26,286 --> 01:59:27,981
Here, take this.

1701
01:59:28,321 --> 01:59:30,653
A quick toast,
and then I'll be off.

1702
01:59:30,824 --> 01:59:33,190
Somebody made a mistake.

1703
01:59:34,194 --> 01:59:36,390
Bumpy ain't hardly
ever go out no more.

1704
01:59:36,564 --> 01:59:38,794
After a certain point
he stayed in the house.

1705
01:59:41,569 --> 01:59:43,730
Watch TV.

1706
01:59:45,039 --> 01:59:47,007
Play chess.
Read the newspaper.

1707
01:59:48,677 --> 01:59:50,770
I though he was just trying
to lead the quiet life,

1708
01:59:50,879 --> 01:59:52,938
but no, he couldn't
go nowhere.

1709
01:59:53,048 --> 01:59:54,515
Not without
something happening.

1710
01:59:54,683 --> 01:59:56,173
Frankie...

1711
01:59:56,351 --> 01:59:57,943
We can still go out.

1712
01:59:58,120 --> 01:59:59,748
With who? Where?

1713
01:59:59,856 --> 02:00:01,483
Well, with...

1714
02:00:01,657 --> 02:00:03,249
But I know he's
under surveillance.

1715
02:00:04,427 --> 02:00:06,088
Ain't gonna be
no Christmas time

1716
02:00:06,262 --> 02:00:07,991
with my family
being here no more.

1717
02:00:08,097 --> 02:00:11,225
Why don't you just pay
who you have to pay?

1718
02:00:11,334 --> 02:00:13,428
I do pay them.
I pay thousands
and millions

1719
02:00:13,604 --> 02:00:15,697
to dope dealers,
crooks, cops.

1720
02:00:16,173 --> 02:00:17,231
I pay everybody.

1721
02:00:17,407 --> 02:00:18,499
I pay more than
they should get.

1722
02:00:18,609 --> 02:00:20,770
I can't satisfy
nobody!

1723
02:00:20,878 --> 02:00:22,937
It's like dope!
Everybody's
strung out!

1724
02:00:23,046 --> 02:00:25,072
The more you give 'em,
the more they want.

1725
02:00:25,216 --> 02:00:27,514
They expect more.

1726
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:30,715
Give more and they want more.

1727
02:00:35,427 --> 02:00:37,521
Do you want to go out?

1728
02:00:38,465 --> 02:00:40,433
All right, baby.
Put something of
what you got.

1729
02:00:40,534 --> 02:00:41,728
Should I?
Yeah.

1730
02:00:41,835 --> 02:00:43,029
That's Christmas spirit.

1731
02:00:43,136 --> 02:00:45,366
That's what I'm talking about.
Feliz Navidad.

1732
02:00:45,472 --> 02:00:47,201
Something nice?
Mmm-hmm.

1733
02:00:54,949 --> 02:00:56,280
We're going to
have a great time.

1734
02:00:56,384 --> 02:00:57,476
That's right, chica.

1735
02:00:57,585 --> 02:01:00,145
Mr. Lucas.
Enjoy your evening.

1736
02:01:01,189 --> 02:01:02,748
It's all clear.

1737
02:01:07,111 --> 02:01:07,839
WOMAN: (EXCITEDLY)
Nicky!

1738
02:01:07,945 --> 02:01:09,742
NICKY: Who is that?
DOC: There's your boy,
Nicky. See him?

1739
02:01:10,948 --> 02:01:13,542
Yeah, I see him.
Let's keep going.

1740
02:01:14,285 --> 02:01:15,344
Around back?

1741
02:01:15,454 --> 02:01:18,548
FRANK: Hell, no. I ain't
sneaking into my own club.

1742
02:01:18,957 --> 02:01:20,891
Incredible.
Huh?

1743
02:01:43,150 --> 02:01:44,549
Come on.

1744
02:01:47,421 --> 02:01:48,445
Hold on. Hold on.

1745
02:01:56,898 --> 02:01:57,922
What?

1746
02:01:58,066 --> 02:01:59,863
I want to wait in the car.

1747
02:01:59,968 --> 02:02:03,028
Frank, I got it. I got it.
I'll wait for it. I got it.

1748
02:02:03,438 --> 02:02:05,464
Get that yellow sauce.
Yellow sauce.

1749
02:02:05,608 --> 02:02:07,633
And the chicken.
The Kung Pao chicken.

1750
02:02:13,917 --> 02:02:15,646
Can you turn the heater on?

1751
02:02:21,993 --> 02:02:24,154
Shit. I'm gonna go
get the keys.

1752
02:02:38,110 --> 02:02:40,635
Doc, give me the keys.
DOC: Here you go.

1753
02:02:46,386 --> 02:02:47,648
Doc!

1754
02:02:51,791 --> 02:02:53,588
Get out of the car.

1755
02:03:00,034 --> 02:03:01,968
DOC: You okay?
Yeah.

1756
02:03:02,069 --> 02:03:03,127
DOC: Shit.

1757
02:03:03,237 --> 02:03:04,329
Come on.

1758
02:03:04,472 --> 02:03:06,498
Come on, baby. You all right?

1759
02:03:07,476 --> 02:03:08,773
Let's go.

1760
02:03:29,432 --> 02:03:30,899
Was it Nicky?

1761
02:03:32,570 --> 02:03:34,902
We'll go right now and
fucking kill him whether
it was him or not,

1762
02:03:35,039 --> 02:03:36,973
you say the word, Frankie.

1763
02:03:38,509 --> 02:03:40,841
We got to do something, Frank.

1764
02:03:41,278 --> 02:03:42,302
We can't just sit here.

1765
02:03:42,413 --> 02:03:43,904
We're leaving.

1766
02:03:47,052 --> 02:03:48,713
All right, everybody get out.
TURNER: You all right, man?

1767
02:03:48,853 --> 02:03:50,981
Go on home.
It's Christmas time.
Go and be with your families.

1768
02:03:51,090 --> 02:03:52,387
I'm all right.

1769
02:03:52,525 --> 02:03:55,426
Go on. Go ahead.
Be with your kids.

1770
02:03:55,561 --> 02:03:56,859
Go ahead.

1771
02:04:09,043 --> 02:04:10,101
Where are we gonna go, huh?

1772
02:04:10,245 --> 02:04:11,837
We're gonna go to Spain,
somewhere? China?

1773
02:04:11,946 --> 02:04:15,438
Huh? Come on, sit down.
Tell me where you want to go.

1774
02:04:16,117 --> 02:04:19,052
Frank, we can go
anywhere we want.

1775
02:04:19,153 --> 02:04:21,053
No, we can't.
We can live anywhere, Frank.

1776
02:04:21,156 --> 02:04:22,851
Where? And do what?
Run? Hide?

1777
02:04:22,958 --> 02:04:25,893
Frank Lucas don't run
from nobody, baby.

1778
02:04:25,995 --> 02:04:27,792
We ain't going nowhere.
We're gonna stay right here.

1779
02:04:27,930 --> 02:04:30,194
We're gonna stay right here.
This is my home.

1780
02:04:30,299 --> 02:04:33,599
This is where my business is,
my wife, my mother, my family.

1781
02:04:33,737 --> 02:04:36,205
My country.
I ain't going nowhere.

1782
02:04:36,906 --> 02:04:39,101
I ain't running from nobody!

1783
02:04:40,477 --> 02:04:42,104
This is America.

1784
02:04:48,919 --> 02:04:51,479
And you ain't going
nowhere, either!

1785
02:04:53,524 --> 02:04:54,650
Huh?

1786
02:04:56,961 --> 02:04:59,624
A ceasefire, internationally
supervised, will begin

1787
02:04:59,765 --> 02:05:04,065
at 7.;00 p.m. This Saturday,
January 27th, Washington time.

1788
02:05:04,169 --> 02:05:06,194
SPEARMAN: I'll call you back.

1789
02:05:06,471 --> 02:05:08,701
Hey! What are you doing?

1790
02:05:10,910 --> 02:05:12,104
Richie.

1791
02:05:15,948 --> 02:05:17,040
Wow.

1792
02:05:19,319 --> 02:05:24,121
So, what I hear it was
the Corsican mob took
a shot at Frank.

1793
02:05:24,258 --> 02:05:26,089
You know, French Connection,
Fernando Rey,

1794
02:05:26,193 --> 02:05:28,559
the exporters that
Frank has put out of business.

1795
02:05:29,964 --> 02:05:32,091
Look, I can take care
of him in New York.

1796
02:05:32,200 --> 02:05:33,667
I just don't want to have
to worry that every time

1797
02:05:33,802 --> 02:05:35,269
he drives across
the bridge to Jersey,

1798
02:05:35,370 --> 02:05:38,169
someone's gonna take
another shot at him.

1799
02:05:38,307 --> 02:05:41,572
Richie, you and I gotta
start working together.

1800
02:05:42,044 --> 02:05:44,410
We need to step up
our efforts.

1801
02:05:44,780 --> 02:05:47,442
Next time,
their aim could be better.

1802
02:05:48,050 --> 02:05:50,645
We need to keep
this cash cow alive.

1803
02:05:56,493 --> 02:05:58,688
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1804
02:05:59,196 --> 02:06:00,527
Whoa!

1805
02:06:03,735 --> 02:06:07,671
Were you actually gonna
arrest Frank Lucas?
What's the matter with you?

1806
02:06:08,072 --> 02:06:10,267
What, you don't know?
No.

1807
02:06:10,975 --> 02:06:13,501
Everybody in
New Jersey's crazy.
Oh.

1808
02:06:14,046 --> 02:06:17,482
You know what we do here?
Cops arrest bad guys.

1809
02:06:19,718 --> 02:06:21,709
Before you get on
that bridge again,

1810
02:06:21,854 --> 02:06:27,222
you should call me first,
just make sure it's safe.

1811
02:06:28,428 --> 02:06:32,023
"I'm more enlightened
than some of my friends. I can
guarantee you peace of mind."

1812
02:06:32,165 --> 02:06:34,463
That's what you
told me, Dominic.

1813
02:06:35,735 --> 02:06:38,296
"I can guarantee you
peace of mind!"

1814
02:06:38,406 --> 02:06:40,465
I don't feel so peaceful!

1815
02:06:41,942 --> 02:06:43,068
Huh?

1816
02:06:45,513 --> 02:06:47,708
They tried to kill my wife!

1817
02:06:52,120 --> 02:06:53,678
Who was that? Huh?

1818
02:06:55,891 --> 02:06:58,257
Maybe it was one
of your peoples.

1819
02:06:58,393 --> 02:07:00,588
I don't know yet. No.
You don't know?

1820
02:07:00,729 --> 02:07:02,253
You don't know.

1821
02:07:03,633 --> 02:07:06,568
I'll tell you what I know.
Maybe I should just
put 500 guns

1822
02:07:06,702 --> 02:07:08,761
out there on the street
and just start shooting up
some people,

1823
02:07:08,871 --> 02:07:09,861
just to make a point.

1824
02:07:09,973 --> 02:07:13,272
Frank, it was a junkie.
It was a rival.
Some dumb-ass kid

1825
02:07:13,410 --> 02:07:17,108
trying to make a name
for himself. Somebody
you forgot to pay off.

1826
02:07:17,248 --> 02:07:20,183
Someone you slighted
without even realizing it.

1827
02:07:20,285 --> 02:07:24,551
Could be someone you
put out of business from being
so successful. Look at you.

1828
02:07:25,390 --> 02:07:28,952
Success, it's got enemies,
Frank. Lots of enemies.

1829
02:07:30,596 --> 02:07:33,121
So your success
took a shot at you. What are
you gonna do now?

1830
02:07:33,265 --> 02:07:36,928
How you gonna kill it?
You're gonna become
unsuccessful?

1831
02:07:37,903 --> 02:07:40,737
Frank, we can be successful
and have enemies, right?

1832
02:07:41,141 --> 02:07:44,406
Or we can be unsuccessful,
too, you know,
we can have friends.

1833
02:07:45,312 --> 02:07:47,405
That's the choice we make.

1834
02:07:48,815 --> 02:07:52,444
MAN ON TV. ; The final
evacuation of military
and diplomatic personnel

1835
02:07:52,586 --> 02:07:56,956
continued throughout
the night, as North Vietnamese
troops marched on Saigon.

1836
02:07:57,291 --> 02:08:02,422
The imminent fall of the city
has brought chaos and a
growing sense of desperation.

1837
02:08:11,440 --> 02:08:14,841
-Operator.
-Bangkok 367. International.

1838
02:08:14,977 --> 02:08:16,501
One moment, please.

1839
02:08:24,888 --> 02:08:26,253
FRANK. ; Yeah, Nate.

1840
02:08:26,356 --> 02:08:28,017
Hey, Frank. What's up, baby?

1841
02:08:28,157 --> 02:08:29,522
What's going on over there?

1842
02:08:29,626 --> 02:08:30,821
It's all over.

1843
02:08:30,961 --> 02:08:32,792
Yeah, I'm watching the news.
What the hell's going on?

1844
02:08:32,897 --> 02:08:34,592
The game's over, Frank.

1845
02:08:34,698 --> 02:08:36,029
Huh?
It's done.

1846
02:08:36,166 --> 02:08:38,134
Everybody going home, baby.
Give peace a chance.

1847
02:08:38,235 --> 02:08:39,600
Well, look, I'm not...
Listen to me.

1848
02:08:39,703 --> 02:08:41,261
I want two...

1849
02:08:42,239 --> 02:08:45,038
(WHISPERING)
I want 2,000
keys in the air.

1850
02:08:45,176 --> 02:08:48,441
It's impossible, Frank.
All our resources are
going home. It's over.

1851
02:08:48,547 --> 02:08:50,311
I'll tell you what.
I'm on my way over there.

1852
02:08:50,416 --> 02:08:52,350
Right now? Oh, come...
Yeah.

1853
02:08:59,726 --> 02:09:01,887
JIMMY: (SHOUTING)
You stole my shit?

1854
02:09:02,029 --> 02:09:04,122
Spearman, wake
the fuck up, man.
What?

1855
02:09:06,066 --> 02:09:07,625
Where's my shit, Darlynn?

1856
02:09:07,735 --> 02:09:09,703
Don't hurt me, Jimmy!

1857
02:09:11,339 --> 02:09:13,170
SPEARMAN: Jesus!
What the... Police!
JONES: Police!

1858
02:09:13,274 --> 02:09:15,071
SPEARMAN: Drop the gun, Jimmy!
JONES: Drop the gun!

1859
02:09:15,209 --> 02:09:17,404
JONES: Let me see your hands!
SPEARMAN: Jimmy,
drop the fucking gun!

1860
02:09:17,545 --> 02:09:20,310
JONES: I'm not playing with
you, Jimmy! I'll blast
your fucking head off!

1861
02:09:20,416 --> 02:09:22,213
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1862
02:09:23,953 --> 02:09:27,047
I got your gun
and I got your prints.

1863
02:09:28,357 --> 02:09:31,554
You know what you got?
You got attempted murder.

1864
02:09:32,762 --> 02:09:34,662
Fifteen fucking years!

1865
02:09:35,065 --> 02:09:38,398
Attempted murder is the
same as Murder One,
that's a grand jury.

1866
02:09:38,535 --> 02:09:40,765
Now, a grand jury could
come back favorably.

1867
02:09:40,904 --> 02:09:43,998
It could be reduced
to manslaughter.

1868
02:09:44,107 --> 02:09:46,269
All right?
Maybe even self-defense.

1869
02:09:46,410 --> 02:09:48,241
It all just depends
on how we wanna deal with you.

1870
02:09:48,379 --> 02:09:50,347
See where this is
fucking going, Jimmy?

1871
02:09:50,448 --> 02:09:53,906
Let's say you beat it.
What you think your cousin
Frank is gonna think?

1872
02:09:54,051 --> 02:09:56,383
Right, he is gonna know,
at some point in time,

1873
02:09:56,487 --> 02:09:58,956
we sat you down,
and we talked to you
like this.

1874
02:09:59,091 --> 02:10:01,753
And then you go to court
and you beat attempted murder?

1875
02:10:01,893 --> 02:10:05,351
What's he gonna think?
Is he stupid? Is your
cousin Frank stupid?

1876
02:10:05,464 --> 02:10:07,364
ABRUZZO: Answer him!

1877
02:10:07,466 --> 02:10:10,129
No. He's going to assume
that you talked.

1878
02:10:13,339 --> 02:10:15,739
But right now,
Frank doesn't know.

1879
02:10:15,842 --> 02:10:18,242
You want Frank to read
about this in the papers?

1880
02:10:18,344 --> 02:10:20,312
Or do you just want to
walk out of here?

1881
02:10:20,446 --> 02:10:24,076
No bail, no trial, no jail,
just walk out of here today.

1882
02:10:25,185 --> 02:10:26,652
Your choice.

1883
02:10:36,465 --> 02:10:40,959
Opium plants are hard enough
to outlive any war.

1884
02:10:42,271 --> 02:10:46,401
They'll still be here
long after the troops
have gone.

1885
02:10:47,778 --> 02:10:52,408
What are you going to do
for transportation when the
last US plane goes home?

1886
02:10:52,949 --> 02:10:54,917
I'll figure something out.

1887
02:10:56,453 --> 02:10:58,819
You will see me again,
that's for sure.

1888
02:11:00,491 --> 02:11:03,460
It is not in my best interest
to say this, Frank,

1889
02:11:03,995 --> 02:11:06,964
but quitting while
you're ahead

1890
02:11:07,665 --> 02:11:09,462
is not the same as quitting.

1891
02:11:51,346 --> 02:11:52,779
Yeah.
Hey.

1892
02:11:52,881 --> 02:11:53,870
Go get him.

1893
02:11:56,785 --> 02:11:59,083
Whatever you want to do, baby.
One second.

1894
02:11:59,221 --> 02:12:00,916
It's Frank.
Yeah.

1895
02:12:03,459 --> 02:12:04,517
Yeah.

1896
02:12:04,627 --> 02:12:05,924
Newark.

1897
02:12:06,796 --> 02:12:08,424
Short term,

1898
02:12:08,966 --> 02:12:10,593
parking lot three.

1899
02:12:11,535 --> 02:12:12,934
Short term, lot three.

1900
02:12:13,370 --> 02:12:16,602
That's the Mustang we talking
about, right? Okay, right.
What's the plate number?

1901
02:12:16,741 --> 02:12:19,209
K-A...
K-A...

1902
02:12:19,310 --> 02:12:21,437
FRANK. ;... 760.
HUEY. ;... 76.

1903
02:12:21,579 --> 02:12:23,240
Zero. All right.

1904
02:12:24,616 --> 02:12:26,607
There's no short term
lot three at Newark.

1905
02:12:26,752 --> 02:12:28,947
They got letters. A-B-C-D.
I know.

1906
02:12:29,088 --> 02:12:30,885
Maybe he means a time. 3:00?

1907
02:12:31,557 --> 02:12:36,187
JONES: This isn't no Jersey
license plate, nor New York,
for that matter.

1908
02:12:36,462 --> 02:12:39,227
K-A-7-6-0?
Yup.

1909
02:12:40,267 --> 02:12:41,894
Kilo Alpha?

1910
02:12:42,435 --> 02:12:44,062
A plane tail number?

1911
02:12:44,471 --> 02:12:46,439
Kilo Alpha 760.

1912
02:12:47,607 --> 02:12:50,405
You check commercial planes.
You guys check private planes.

1913
02:12:50,510 --> 02:12:53,275
Everything, from a little
fucking Cessna to the biggest
fucking whatever jet.

1914
02:12:53,414 --> 02:12:54,472
All right?

1915
02:12:54,615 --> 02:12:55,946
I'll check military planes.
Where you going, Jimmy?

1916
02:12:56,083 --> 02:12:58,244
You're not going anywhere.
Sit... Sit down.

1917
02:13:21,644 --> 02:13:23,077
Captain?
Yeah?

1918
02:13:23,179 --> 02:13:27,138
Richie Roberts. Essex County.
I know you're expecting us.

1919
02:13:27,550 --> 02:13:30,076
Here's our warrant.
We're looking on the plane.

1920
02:13:30,187 --> 02:13:31,347
Wait! Wait!

1921
02:13:31,488 --> 02:13:34,924
Scotty, stop all these
soldiers! Check their bags.
Every one of them.

1922
02:13:45,337 --> 02:13:46,964
No-knock warrant.

1923
02:13:47,707 --> 02:13:50,301
All right. Start upstairs.
Where are they going?

1924
02:13:50,409 --> 02:13:51,535
Step in, sweetie.

1925
02:13:52,345 --> 02:13:53,870
Ma'am, please sit down.

1926
02:13:54,014 --> 02:13:55,174
MRS. LUCAS: What is this?

1927
02:13:56,016 --> 02:13:59,474
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
All this stops!
Hey. Hey. Hey.

1928
02:13:59,586 --> 02:14:02,487
Nothing leaves this area,
all right?
Just slow down with this.

1929
02:14:03,023 --> 02:14:04,991
All right. Stop these trucks.
MAN: Hold on, hold on.

1930
02:14:05,092 --> 02:14:07,027
RICHIE: Everything off the
walls! Just pull it all down.

1931
02:14:07,161 --> 02:14:08,458
SPEARMAN: Damn
thing's a monster, Rich.

1932
02:14:08,563 --> 02:14:09,552
What is this?

1933
02:14:09,697 --> 02:14:10,823
Nothing leaves this area
till we've checked it.

1934
02:14:10,932 --> 02:14:12,229
All right, Captain. Nothing.

1935
02:14:12,333 --> 02:14:14,358
We got to take the plane down,
we got to look in the trucks.

1936
02:14:14,502 --> 02:14:15,696
Every man here gets searched.

1937
02:14:15,837 --> 02:14:17,202
Read the warrant, sir.

1938
02:14:18,373 --> 02:14:20,842
Your husband's
illustrious career is over.

1939
02:14:21,677 --> 02:14:24,874
The Feds are gonna come in,
gonna take everything.

1940
02:14:25,281 --> 02:14:29,240
And then they're gonna
take it all. But not before
I get my gratuity.

1941
02:14:30,386 --> 02:14:31,615
So where's the money?

1942
02:14:31,721 --> 02:14:33,279
What are you talking about?
What money?

1943
02:14:33,390 --> 02:14:34,948
What am I talking about?
What money?

1944
02:14:35,058 --> 02:14:39,154
The getaway money that
Frank and every other gangster
keeps in his house.

1945
02:14:39,262 --> 02:14:42,561
If you leave now,
there's a chance
Frank might not kill you.

1946
02:14:44,402 --> 02:14:45,926
Shut up! Sit down!

1947
02:14:46,070 --> 02:14:47,332
Sit down!

1948
02:15:28,049 --> 02:15:30,381
MAN ON TV. ; Defense today
announced the
planned evacuation

1949
02:15:30,485 --> 02:15:33,512
of all remaining US
combat forces from Vietnam,

1950
02:15:33,622 --> 02:15:36,352
news that comes
too late for some,

1951
02:15:36,459 --> 02:15:40,088
as here, on a solemn tarmac at
Dover Air Force Base.

1952
02:15:40,229 --> 02:15:43,721
This C-130,
loaded down with
its sorrowful cargo,

1953
02:15:43,833 --> 02:15:48,066
a cargo of America's bravest
and best, en route to
their final resting places.

1954
02:16:03,755 --> 02:16:05,222
You guys.
Take this coffin down.

1955
02:16:13,766 --> 02:16:15,393
Open it.
I'm not doing that.

1956
02:16:22,174 --> 02:16:24,143
Great fucking dog, huh?

1957
02:16:32,152 --> 02:16:34,017
You stop this, right now.

1958
02:16:34,154 --> 02:16:37,022
My warrant gives me permission
to examine this plane,

1959
02:16:38,325 --> 02:16:39,792
the plane and its cargo.

1960
02:16:40,294 --> 02:16:42,319
Well, you don't have
my permission.

1961
02:16:43,330 --> 02:16:44,797
I don't need it, Captain.

1962
02:16:46,500 --> 02:16:49,129
Easy! Easy, boy.
Come on. Hey!

1963
02:16:50,005 --> 02:16:51,973
Frank, move out of the way.

1964
02:16:59,014 --> 02:17:00,311
Damn.

1965
02:17:05,188 --> 02:17:06,382
That's enough!

1966
02:17:14,199 --> 02:17:16,167
Stay with these coffins.
Do not let them
out of your sight.

1967
02:17:16,267 --> 02:17:17,564
Got it. Okay.

1968
02:17:19,204 --> 02:17:20,501
TRUPO: Hey.
Help me out with this.

1969
02:17:45,966 --> 02:17:48,400
That was a military
transport plane.

1970
02:17:48,535 --> 02:17:49,695
If there was heroin
was onboard,

1971
02:17:49,803 --> 02:17:51,601
then someone in the military
would have to be involved.

1972
02:17:51,739 --> 02:17:54,435
Which means that even as
it fights a war that's claimed

1973
02:17:54,575 --> 02:17:58,602
50,000 American lives,
the military is smuggling
narcotics.

1974
02:17:58,746 --> 02:18:01,374
That is how this event today
will be interpreted.

1975
02:18:01,482 --> 02:18:03,110
That someone
employed by this office

1976
02:18:03,252 --> 02:18:06,949
believes that the United
States Army is in the
drug trafficking business

1977
02:18:07,089 --> 02:18:10,252
and is trying to prove it
by desecrating the
remains of young men

1978
02:18:10,392 --> 02:18:13,122
who have given their lives
in the defense of democracy!

1979
02:18:13,262 --> 02:18:15,788
There is dope on that plane.
Shut the fuck up!

1980
02:18:17,267 --> 02:18:20,395
Is it any wonder, then,
because of your actions,

1981
02:18:20,770 --> 02:18:23,068
the entire federal narcotics
program is now in jeopardy

1982
02:18:23,173 --> 02:18:26,142
of being dismantled
as completely and
enthusiastically

1983
02:18:26,276 --> 02:18:28,074
as that fucking
transport plane?

1984
02:18:28,179 --> 02:18:30,647
That is what you've
accomplished, Mr. Roberts,
single-handedly.

1985
02:18:30,781 --> 02:18:32,408
I had good information.

1986
02:18:32,950 --> 02:18:36,317
That the target of my
investigation was bringing
dope in on that plane.

1987
02:18:36,453 --> 02:18:38,387
And that target is?
Frank Lucas.

1988
02:18:38,489 --> 02:18:40,458
Who?
His name's Frank Lucas.

1989
02:18:40,625 --> 02:18:43,093
Who is Frank Lucas?
Who does he work for?
Which family?

1990
02:18:43,195 --> 02:18:45,254
He's not Italian. He's black.

1991
02:18:48,801 --> 02:18:51,167
Is that supposed to be
some kind of a joke?

1992
02:18:51,804 --> 02:18:54,035
You're this close
to the end of your career
in law enforcement

1993
02:18:54,141 --> 02:18:56,006
and you're making
fucking jokes?

1994
02:18:56,810 --> 02:18:58,937
My investigation indicates

1995
02:18:59,346 --> 02:19:02,281
that Frank Lucas is
above the Mafia in
the dope business.

1996
02:19:02,783 --> 02:19:04,444
My investigations
also indicate

1997
02:19:04,551 --> 02:19:08,579
that Frank Lucas buys
direct from a source
in Southeast Asia.

1998
02:19:08,690 --> 02:19:11,818
He cuts out the middlemen
and uses US military planes

1999
02:19:11,960 --> 02:19:15,794
and personnel to transport
pure #4 heroin into
the United States

2000
02:19:15,897 --> 02:19:19,959
and he's been doing so
on a regular basis since 1969.

2001
02:19:20,069 --> 02:19:22,970
I have cases against
every member of
Frank's organization.

2002
02:19:23,072 --> 02:19:24,164
Frank's organization?

2003
02:19:24,306 --> 02:19:28,037
No fucking nigger has ever
accomplished what the American
Mafia hasn't in 100 years!

2004
02:19:28,177 --> 02:19:31,113
And you would know that how?
Why? 'Cause your head is stuck
up your fucking ass?

2005
02:19:31,214 --> 02:19:33,546
Hey, Lou, do me a favor.
Will you get this fucking
kike out of here?

2006
02:19:33,683 --> 02:19:35,150
Kike? Kike?

2007
02:19:35,252 --> 02:19:36,310
Richie, no.

2008
02:19:39,856 --> 02:19:40,982
Hey, Richie!

2009
02:19:42,425 --> 02:19:43,552
Make it stick.

2010
02:19:44,362 --> 02:19:46,830
Spearman's with the coffins.
They're about a
quarter mile away.

2011
02:20:18,097 --> 02:20:19,394
FRANK: Doctor.

2012
02:20:21,235 --> 02:20:22,361
What?

2013
02:20:22,903 --> 02:20:25,872
Fucking Trupo came
by the house, man. It's bad.

2014
02:20:40,756 --> 02:20:43,782
Frankie, I need to speak
with you a minute. Please?

2015
02:20:43,926 --> 02:20:46,760
I got to go, Ma.
No, sit down just a minute.

2016
02:20:46,897 --> 02:20:49,457
Would you please
come back a little later?

2017
02:20:49,599 --> 02:20:50,793
Thank you.

2018
02:20:50,934 --> 02:20:52,902
Ma, I got to go. All right?
Just a few words.

2019
02:20:53,003 --> 02:20:54,265
Listen to me. I got...

2020
02:20:54,404 --> 02:20:56,201
Please, sit down.
Just a few words.

2021
02:20:56,807 --> 02:20:58,400
I've been thinking
about some things.

2022
02:20:58,509 --> 02:21:02,036
If you'd been a preacher,
your brothers would
have been preachers.

2023
02:21:02,146 --> 02:21:03,204
Right.

2024
02:21:03,314 --> 02:21:07,250
If you'd been a soldier,
they'd be soldiers.
You know that.

2025
02:21:07,352 --> 02:21:10,982
They came here because
of you. You called and
they came running.

2026
02:21:11,123 --> 02:21:12,112
Right.

2027
02:21:12,257 --> 02:21:15,658
That's because
they look up to you.

2028
02:21:15,794 --> 02:21:19,594
They always expect you
to know what's best.

2029
02:21:20,366 --> 02:21:22,335
But even they know

2030
02:21:22,635 --> 02:21:24,432
you don't shoot cops.

2031
02:21:26,506 --> 02:21:28,133
Even I know that.

2032
02:21:29,309 --> 02:21:30,776
Eva knows it.
All right, Ma.

2033
02:21:30,877 --> 02:21:33,368
The only one who
doesn't seem
to know is you!

2034
02:21:33,480 --> 02:21:36,609
All right, Ma. I got to go.
I promise you,
I ain't gonna shoot nobody.

2035
02:21:36,717 --> 02:21:40,483
I never asked you where
all this came from because
I didn't want to hear you lie.

2036
02:21:40,621 --> 02:21:42,714
I didn't want you to
worry about it. Now,
come on, I got to go.

2037
02:21:42,823 --> 02:21:44,290
Don't lie to me!

2038
02:21:48,830 --> 02:21:50,297
Don't do that.

2039
02:21:51,967 --> 02:21:55,300
Do you want to
make things so bad

2040
02:21:55,404 --> 02:21:58,237
for your family
that they'll leave you?
Because they will.

2041
02:21:58,340 --> 02:21:59,364
They'll understand.

2042
02:21:59,509 --> 02:22:01,807
She will leave you.

2043
02:22:01,911 --> 02:22:02,935
All right, Mama.

2044
02:22:05,883 --> 02:22:07,510
I will leave you!

2045
02:22:34,880 --> 02:22:36,677
JONES: Got coffins
on the move, Richie.

2046
02:22:36,783 --> 02:22:39,911
RICHIE: We want the
transport coffins,
not the ceremonial ones.

2047
02:22:41,455 --> 02:22:42,922
Who are these guys?

2048
02:22:45,158 --> 02:22:46,591
RICHIE: What does it say?

2049
02:22:49,564 --> 02:22:52,124
JONES: Bayonne
Custodial Services?

2050
02:22:52,233 --> 02:22:53,860
SPEARMAN: Bayonne
Cleaning Services?

2051
02:22:53,968 --> 02:22:55,128
ABRUZZO: Bayonne?
What the fuck is that?

2052
02:22:55,236 --> 02:22:56,703
SPEARMAN: Give me
the camera, Al.

2053
02:22:59,740 --> 02:23:00,866
RICHIE: Bingo.

2054
02:23:00,975 --> 02:23:03,740
JONES: Holy shit.
That's the baseball kid.

2055
02:23:03,879 --> 02:23:05,870
Oh, yeah.
That's Stevie Lucas.

2056
02:23:05,981 --> 02:23:08,541
So what you want to do,
Richie? Follow the trucks?

2057
02:23:08,650 --> 02:23:10,777
No. No. I wanna stay here
with the Lucas kid.

2058
02:23:11,587 --> 02:23:13,214
We'll follow that van.

2059
02:23:13,589 --> 02:23:16,718
You guys better eat up.
We're gonna have a long night.

2060
02:23:27,838 --> 02:23:29,703
HUEY: Come on,
more precious than gold, man.

2061
02:23:29,807 --> 02:23:31,365
This is more precious
than gold.

2062
02:23:31,942 --> 02:23:34,410
We got a couple more.
Let's go. Stack that up.

2063
02:23:35,446 --> 02:23:37,380
Take it. Take it.

2064
02:23:37,481 --> 02:23:38,914
MAN: Give me a second,
man, give me a second.

2065
02:23:41,119 --> 02:23:44,611
Hey. Yo. We got four caskets
left, man. Let's make some
fucking money in here.

2066
02:23:47,293 --> 02:23:48,419
SPEARMAN: What are
they loading in there?

2067
02:23:48,528 --> 02:23:49,722
ABRUZZO: What the fuck
are they loading in there?

2068
02:23:49,829 --> 02:23:50,921
SPEARMAN: That's the dope.

2069
02:23:51,030 --> 02:23:54,000
That's got to be
the dope! It's got to be.

2070
02:23:54,635 --> 02:23:55,932
RICHIE: Let's go.

2071
02:23:56,803 --> 02:23:57,963
Let's move.

2072
02:24:50,828 --> 02:24:52,125
Lou, it's Richie.

2073
02:24:52,396 --> 02:24:54,957
We got everybody
in place. Everybody.

2074
02:24:55,067 --> 02:24:56,159
TOBACK. ; Are you
sure this is it?

2075
02:24:56,268 --> 02:24:57,792
I'm positive, man. Okay?

2076
02:24:58,270 --> 02:24:59,897
All right, they're cutting
and bagging

2077
02:25:00,038 --> 02:25:02,871
in the South Tower
of the Stephen Crane
Projects right now.

2078
02:25:03,175 --> 02:25:05,143
TOBACK. ;
Are you sure this
is it? You're positive?

2079
02:25:05,243 --> 02:25:08,008
RICHIE. ; I'm positive, Lou.
I'm positive. Okay?

2080
02:25:08,114 --> 02:25:10,582
Everything is ready to go.
All the guys are ready to go.

2081
02:25:10,717 --> 02:25:12,810
Just push the button,
give me the warrant, okay?

2082
02:25:13,119 --> 02:25:14,711
Okay. You got it.

2083
02:25:22,429 --> 02:25:23,691
MAN: You all right?

2084
02:26:16,355 --> 02:26:17,913
Got the warrant.
All right.

2085
02:26:22,028 --> 02:26:23,393
Let's go!

2086
02:26:40,281 --> 02:26:41,509
Move!

2087
02:26:44,719 --> 02:26:47,154
Hi, ma'am. What's your name?
What's going on here?

2088
02:26:48,156 --> 02:26:50,147
Get down!
Get down, motherfucker!

2089
02:26:51,326 --> 02:26:54,022
Go.
Okay. Let's go, Al!

2090
02:26:54,196 --> 02:26:55,629
Move it, come on.

2091
02:26:56,531 --> 02:26:58,158
Come on, move it. Move it!

2092
02:27:41,181 --> 02:27:42,307
(WHISPERS) All set.

2093
02:27:43,049 --> 02:27:44,209
(WHISPERS) Roger.

2094
02:27:45,886 --> 02:27:46,944
Get ready.

2095
02:27:47,187 --> 02:27:49,019
MAN: There you go!
BOY: All right.

2096
02:27:50,858 --> 02:27:51,847
MAN: Come on.

2097
02:28:00,168 --> 02:28:01,227
At target.

2098
02:28:02,337 --> 02:28:04,305
Spearman, stand by.

2099
02:28:04,506 --> 02:28:06,906
I got civilians
on the target floor.

2100
02:28:09,745 --> 02:28:11,406
BOY: What? Oh...

2101
02:28:11,780 --> 02:28:13,214
MAN: Come on, there you go.

2102
02:28:13,550 --> 02:28:14,812
WOMAN: Hey, Tim.

2103
02:28:15,118 --> 02:28:17,245
MAN: Girl,
why don't you get
some clothes on?

2104
02:28:21,925 --> 02:28:23,051
MAN: Let's go.

2105
02:28:29,767 --> 02:28:31,359
You think you bad, huh?

2106
02:28:35,606 --> 02:28:38,337
Hold on. Where you going?
Where you going?

2107
02:28:38,543 --> 02:28:39,771
Come on!

2108
02:28:41,580 --> 02:28:42,911
BOY: I'll get it!

2109
02:28:45,318 --> 02:28:46,580
Where's Tim?

2110
02:28:47,587 --> 02:28:48,849
Quiet, kid!

2111
02:28:55,729 --> 02:28:57,754
I got some sandwiches
for you boys, man.

2112
02:29:00,500 --> 02:29:01,933
But where's Tim?

2113
02:29:02,236 --> 02:29:04,637
Shit. Man,
Tim always playing around.

2114
02:29:06,174 --> 02:29:07,471
Hey, man!

2115
02:29:07,775 --> 02:29:09,709
You got some Blue Magic, baby?

2116
02:29:11,112 --> 02:29:12,477
Fucking junkie!

2117
02:29:13,448 --> 02:29:14,881
Yo, handle that!

2118
02:29:14,983 --> 02:29:16,474
JONES: I'm sick! Come on!
I got money, man!

2119
02:29:16,585 --> 02:29:18,450
Come on, man,
you know me, baby!

2120
02:29:18,587 --> 02:29:21,317
Come on! Come on,
I need that Blue Magic, man.

2121
02:29:21,457 --> 02:29:22,890
It's me, Boogaloo, baby.

2122
02:29:22,992 --> 02:29:26,086
Hey, man, you know I got
your god damn money.
Come on, man.

2123
02:29:26,195 --> 02:29:28,221
And one, two, three!
GUARD: Fucking junkie.

2124
02:29:30,166 --> 02:29:31,963
ABRUZZO: Police! Police!

2125
02:29:32,202 --> 02:29:33,931
Drop it!
SPEARMAN: Get out, get out!

2126
02:29:34,037 --> 02:29:35,129
Drop the gun!
Don't do it!

2127
02:29:35,272 --> 02:29:36,796
Drop the gun, drop it!
Don't do it.

2128
02:29:39,476 --> 02:29:40,671
Scotty!

2129
02:29:44,148 --> 02:29:45,672
Police! Everybody down!

2130
02:29:48,152 --> 02:29:49,312
You motherfucker!

2131
02:29:52,456 --> 02:29:54,482
SPEARMAN: Police! Nobody move!
Look out!

2132
02:30:02,668 --> 02:30:04,533
RICHIE: Don't fucking move!

2133
02:30:14,514 --> 02:30:14,981
ABRUZZO: I want to see
your hands! All the hands!

2134
02:30:14,981 --> 02:30:17,040
ABRUZZO: I want to see
your hands! All the hands!

2135
02:30:17,183 --> 02:30:18,173
Police!

2136
02:30:21,822 --> 02:30:23,950
Down! Down! Get down!

2137
02:30:24,059 --> 02:30:25,822
Stay the fuck down!

2138
02:31:17,583 --> 02:31:19,711
Hey, man, what's going on?

2139
02:31:25,125 --> 02:31:26,615
What the hell...

2140
02:31:39,106 --> 02:31:41,438
Stay down! Down,
motherfucker! Stay down!

2141
02:31:41,575 --> 02:31:43,133
Hands! Hands!

2142
02:31:48,016 --> 02:31:49,745
Out at home, baby.

2143
02:32:00,963 --> 02:32:03,262
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.

2144
02:32:03,467 --> 02:32:05,958
FRANK: Y'all wait right here.
Wait right here.

2145
02:32:29,895 --> 02:32:33,023
Mrs. Lucas,
please step back inside.
Yes, Officer.

2146
02:32:33,199 --> 02:32:34,633
Please, Mother Lucas,
step inside, please.

2147
02:32:34,734 --> 02:32:38,101
Respectfully, ma'am,
please step inside.
Thank you. Step inside.

2148
02:32:49,417 --> 02:32:51,817
Hands up against the wall.
Stay back.

2149
02:32:54,188 --> 02:32:55,519
Oh, man.

2150
02:32:55,656 --> 02:32:58,352
Don't you owe me money?
I'll get you some more.
Here you go.

2151
02:33:00,195 --> 02:33:02,288
Yo, yo! Pigs! Look out!

2152
02:33:02,397 --> 02:33:04,456
POLICEMAN: NYPD!
Everybody stand still!

2153
02:33:07,536 --> 02:33:09,060
Turner! Go!

2154
02:33:10,572 --> 02:33:12,666
Down on the ground,
motherfucker!

2155
02:33:46,746 --> 02:33:51,377
...dead servicemen returning
from defending our
country in Vietnam...

2156
02:33:53,921 --> 02:33:56,856
Over there. Okay.

2157
02:34:02,430 --> 02:34:05,399
JUDGE: Ladies and
gentlemen, at this stage
of the proceedings

2158
02:34:05,500 --> 02:34:08,367
the counsels are ready
for their opening statements.

2159
02:34:08,903 --> 02:34:11,929
For the prosecution,
Mr. Roberts will proceed

2160
02:34:12,073 --> 02:34:14,372
with his opening
statement first.

2161
02:34:14,843 --> 02:34:18,711
Mr. Roberts,
are you ready to proceed?

2162
02:34:20,316 --> 02:34:21,943
Yes, Your Honor.

2163
02:34:26,021 --> 02:34:28,582
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

2164
02:34:32,963 --> 02:34:36,399
the state will show
and you will hear

2165
02:34:36,967 --> 02:34:39,835
that Frank Lucas
is the most dangerous man

2166
02:34:40,905 --> 02:34:43,203
walking the streets
of our city.

2167
02:34:45,943 --> 02:34:49,845
All right, y'all,
get on out. Let me talk to
Mr. Richie alone.

2168
02:34:52,951 --> 02:34:56,352
Come on, come on, come on.
I pay y'all by the hour,
not by the minute.

2169
02:34:59,157 --> 02:35:00,488
Thank you.

2170
02:35:05,131 --> 02:35:07,361
You ain't wearing a wire,
are you?

2171
02:35:08,167 --> 02:35:09,191
No.

2172
02:35:10,370 --> 02:35:11,428
All right.

2173
02:35:11,537 --> 02:35:15,871
I was talking to my lawyers.
They said something to me,
I can't believe it.

2174
02:35:17,344 --> 02:35:20,541
Did you really find
a million dollars in
the trunk of a car

2175
02:35:20,681 --> 02:35:22,376
and then turn it in?
Did you do that?
Yeah.

2176
02:35:22,517 --> 02:35:23,882
You did that for real, huh?

2177
02:35:24,019 --> 02:35:27,216
My man. Good for you. Shit.

2178
02:35:27,355 --> 02:35:29,449
You know Johnny Law got,
though, right?

2179
02:35:29,659 --> 02:35:31,650
About it, Mr. Richie.

2180
02:35:31,761 --> 02:35:33,991
You know he got it.
You turned that money in,

2181
02:35:34,096 --> 02:35:36,621
he took it and you ain't
get nothing for it. Did you?

2182
02:35:36,732 --> 02:35:38,165
Why did you do that?

2183
02:35:38,567 --> 02:35:40,899
It was the right thing to do.
That's true.

2184
02:35:41,338 --> 02:35:43,306
That's a good answer.
It was the right thing to do.

2185
02:35:43,440 --> 02:35:45,635
The question I have,
the question I've been
asking myself is,

2186
02:35:45,742 --> 02:35:47,334
would you do it again?

2187
02:35:48,612 --> 02:35:51,513
I mean, that's a lot of money,
that's a long time ago.

2188
02:35:51,948 --> 02:35:55,476
Many car payments ago,
many child support
payments ago.

2189
02:35:57,255 --> 02:36:01,089
So I said to myself,
the onlyest way to find out
is to find out.

2190
02:36:02,627 --> 02:36:08,396
RICHIE: Bribery, extortion,
murder, racketeering...

2191
02:36:10,369 --> 02:36:12,098
FRANK. ; Now,
you give me an address,

2192
02:36:12,237 --> 02:36:15,502
I'll make sure the
car's there, I'll make sure
that money's in that trunk.

2193
02:36:15,607 --> 02:36:17,006
No, thanks.

2194
02:36:17,376 --> 02:36:18,674
You sure?

2195
02:36:20,480 --> 02:36:23,381
Come on, now, Richie.
What do you think,
that impresses me?

2196
02:36:23,583 --> 02:36:26,552
You think that you're better
than them? You ain't no better
than them other cops.

2197
02:36:26,653 --> 02:36:28,883
In fact, you're the same
as them. You are them.

2198
02:36:29,622 --> 02:36:30,954
Let me ask you this.

2199
02:36:31,092 --> 02:36:34,220
Do you really think that
putting me behind bars

2200
02:36:34,328 --> 02:36:36,228
is going to change
anything on them streets?

2201
02:36:36,330 --> 02:36:37,957
Them dope fiends
is gonna shoot it,

2202
02:36:38,065 --> 02:36:40,192
they're gonna steal for it,
they're gonna die for it.

2203
02:36:40,301 --> 02:36:43,065
Putting me in or out
ain't gonna change one thing.

2204
02:36:43,438 --> 02:36:44,700
Then that's the way it is.

2205
02:36:44,806 --> 02:36:46,637
That's just the way it is.
So what we got, Richie?

2206
02:36:46,842 --> 02:36:48,605
We got me and you
sitting here.

2207
02:36:48,910 --> 02:36:51,811
We got that little snitch-ass
driver for my brother.

2208
02:36:51,913 --> 02:36:53,380
You got a little
bit of powder.

2209
02:36:53,682 --> 02:36:55,547
You're going to need
more than that, Richie.

2210
02:36:55,818 --> 02:36:59,310
RICHIE. ; I got possession,
supply, conspiracy,

2211
02:36:59,522 --> 02:37:03,619
bribing a law officer. I got
people who'll attest to seeing
you kill in cold blood.

2212
02:37:03,761 --> 02:37:07,663
I got your offshore bank
accounts, your real estate,
your businesses,

2213
02:37:07,798 --> 02:37:10,267
all bought with money
from heroin.

2214
02:37:10,602 --> 02:37:13,332
And I got hundreds of
parents of dead kids.

2215
02:37:13,772 --> 02:37:16,263
Addicts who OD'ed on
your product. And that's
my story for the jury.

2216
02:37:16,374 --> 02:37:19,935
And that's how I make
it all stick. " This man
murdered thousands of people.

2217
02:37:20,044 --> 02:37:22,013
"And he did it
from a penthouse,
driving a Lincoln."

2218
02:37:22,148 --> 02:37:23,945
Aside from that,
you got nothing
to worry about.

2219
02:37:24,049 --> 02:37:26,916
That's pretty good.
But that's why we go to
court, isn't it, Richie?

2220
02:37:27,019 --> 02:37:28,452
'Cause I got witnesses, too.

2221
02:37:28,687 --> 02:37:32,646
I got celebrities.
I got sports figures.
I got Harlem, Richie.

2222
02:37:33,193 --> 02:37:36,993
I took care of Harlem, so
Harlem's gonna take care
of me. You can believe that.

2223
02:37:37,130 --> 02:37:39,598
I got more than that, Frank.
What you got?

2224
02:37:39,699 --> 02:37:42,361
I've got a line of people
wanting to testify
against you,

2225
02:37:42,502 --> 02:37:44,834
it stretches out the door
and around the block.

2226
02:37:44,971 --> 02:37:48,772
You damaged a lot of lives,
Frank. I got the Mazzano
crime family.

2227
02:37:48,876 --> 02:37:50,468
Remember those boys?
You put them out of business.

2228
02:37:50,578 --> 02:37:52,136
I ain't got nothing to do
with no Mazzanos.

2229
02:37:52,246 --> 02:37:53,304
Mazzanos ain't got nothing
to do with me.

2230
02:37:53,414 --> 02:37:54,813
They got everything
to do with you.
What, they...

2231
02:37:54,916 --> 02:37:55,974
You know why?
Why?

2232
02:37:56,083 --> 02:37:58,644
Because apart from the fact
that they hate you personally,

2233
02:37:59,154 --> 02:38:00,485
they hate what you represent.

2234
02:38:00,589 --> 02:38:03,649
I don't represent nothing
but Frank Lucas.
You sure?

2235
02:38:04,059 --> 02:38:05,993
A black businessman like you?

2236
02:38:06,428 --> 02:38:07,952
You represent progress.

2237
02:38:08,697 --> 02:38:11,690
The kind of progress
that's going to see them
lose a lot of money.

2238
02:38:12,268 --> 02:38:15,829
With you out of the way,
everything can return
to normal.

2239
02:38:16,973 --> 02:38:18,201
My man.

2240
02:38:23,047 --> 02:38:25,038
You know what normal
is to me, Richie?

2241
02:38:25,349 --> 02:38:28,250
I ain't seen normal since
I was six years old.

2242
02:38:29,887 --> 02:38:32,481
Normal is seeing the police
right up to my house

2243
02:38:32,590 --> 02:38:35,526
dragging my little
12-year-old cousin out,
tying him to a pole,

2244
02:38:35,627 --> 02:38:38,755
shoving a shotgun in his mouth
so hard they bust his teeth.

2245
02:38:38,897 --> 02:38:42,163
Then they bust two shotgun
shells in his head and
knock his fucking head off.

2246
02:38:42,268 --> 02:38:43,496
That's what normal is to me.

2247
02:38:43,603 --> 02:38:46,663
I didn't give a fuck
about no police then.

2248
02:38:46,772 --> 02:38:49,742
I don't give a fuck about
no police now. Shit.

2249
02:38:50,110 --> 02:38:52,340
You know what, you can do
whatever you want to do.

2250
02:38:52,479 --> 02:38:54,947
So, it don't mean nothing
to me for you to show up
tomorrow morning

2251
02:38:55,082 --> 02:38:57,550
with your head blown off.
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

2252
02:38:58,085 --> 02:39:00,452
Yeah, Frank. Get in line.

2253
02:39:01,122 --> 02:39:03,352
That one stretches
around the block, too.

2254
02:39:06,761 --> 02:39:08,092
All right.

2255
02:39:11,833 --> 02:39:13,267
What do you want to do?

2256
02:39:19,975 --> 02:39:21,636
You know what you got to do.

2257
02:39:21,810 --> 02:39:23,573
What do you want me to do?
Snitch, huh?

2258
02:39:23,679 --> 02:39:25,146
I know you don't want me
to give up no cops.

2259
02:39:25,282 --> 02:39:26,749
What do you want?
You want gangsters?

2260
02:39:27,350 --> 02:39:30,945
Pick one. Jew gangsters?
Mick gangsters? Guineas?

2261
02:39:31,621 --> 02:39:34,419
They've been bleeding
Harlem dry since they got
off the boat, Richie.

2262
02:39:34,524 --> 02:39:38,325
I don't give a fuck
about no crime figures.
You can have them.

2263
02:39:39,330 --> 02:39:40,763
I'll take them, too.

2264
02:39:41,032 --> 02:39:42,932
You'll take them, too?

2265
02:39:48,105 --> 02:39:51,769
No, you didn't.
You're talking about police.
You want police?

2266
02:39:52,344 --> 02:39:53,470
You want your own kind?

2267
02:39:53,579 --> 02:39:54,841
They're not my kind.

2268
02:39:55,614 --> 02:39:58,174
They're in business with you,
Frank. They ain't my kind.

2269
02:39:58,450 --> 02:40:02,352
They ain't my kind
like the Italians are
not yours. All right?

2270
02:40:05,358 --> 02:40:06,347
Huh.

2271
02:40:15,936 --> 02:40:18,302
What can you
promise me, Richie?

2272
02:40:21,343 --> 02:40:24,312
I can promise you,
you lie about one name,

2273
02:40:24,679 --> 02:40:26,408
you'll never
get out of prison.

2274
02:40:26,881 --> 02:40:31,979
You lie about one dollar, in

Your evidence alone
gave me 150 convictions.

2345
02:47:25,654 --> 02:47:28,646
Thought the least
we could do is give
you a ride home.

2346
02:47:29,090 --> 02:47:30,922
Yeah, you sure
did that.

home. Free ride.

Coming to gangsters.

2349
02:47:39,635 --> 02:47:40,602
What?

2350
02:47:43,105 --> 02:47:46,007
Ain't nothin', man.
Ain't nothin', man.

2351
02:47:46,843 --> 02:47:48,970
That's life right there.
That's life right there.

2352

Even a fool gets
to be young once.
