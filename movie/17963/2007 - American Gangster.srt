in unmarked cash

780
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,597
and gave that shit back.
Is that true?

781
00:55:41,222 --> 00:55:44,267
Yeah, I did.
Anybody got a problem with that?

I think about it every day.

784
00:55:50,565 --> 00:55:53,526
I should be down in South Florida with a
68-foot cruiser doing fishing charters.

MAN: You and me, both.

I didn't, so here I am,

Yeah.

twice the potency.

792
00:57:01,678 --> 00:57:06,307
I mean, it's the purest thing I ever seen in
the streets. It's strong enough to smoke.

And that's for those white suburban kids
who are scared of needles.

I mean, it's on every corner out there.

Actually seen it go down?

927
01:03:40,841 --> 01:03:44,219
Yeah, seen it go down.
Been in his place. Seen him handle drugs.

928

He's fucking dead.
About four weeks ago.

Mr. Roberts?
I'm here for our appointment.

Morning.

She did mention your name, though.

01:18:36,384 --> 01:18:37,552
The stewardess?

1093
01:18:37,636 --> 01:18:39,554
No, not the stewardess.

1094
01:18:40,222 --> 01:18:43,850
The lady from Child Services.
She mentioned your name.

1095
01:18:43,975 --> 01:18:47,979
Right after she asked me
if I associated with any criminals.

Come on. Come on.

1102
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:04,955
So, how'd she get my name?

1103
01:19:05,038 --> 01:19:06,498
Laurie.
Hmm.

1104
01:19:07,499 --> 01:19:09,876
She's been saying a lot lately.

1105
01:19:10,669 --> 01:19:11,920
A lot.

1106
01:19:15,715 --> 01:19:18,301
You know, when you asked me
to be your son's godfather,

1107
01:19:18,385 --> 01:19:19,594
I took it very seriously.

1108
01:19:19,678 --> 01:19:21,596
I know.
I know and I appreciate that.

1109
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:24,641
And I said yes, I would take
on this responsibility.

1110
01:19:24,724 --> 01:19:27,310
Take care of your son, if God
forbid, something happened to you.

1111
01:19:27,394 --> 01:19:30,313
Joe, the kind of things
she's saying to Child Social Services

1112
01:19:30,397 --> 01:19:33,108
made me look really bad, all right.

Okay, I understand.

1120
01:19:51,459 --> 01:19:55,505
They ask me, I'll tell them what you
want me to tell them. I'll lie for you.

1121
01:19:55,589 --> 01:19:57,799
No, don't lie.
You don't have to lie.

1122
01:19:57,883 --> 01:20:01,052
Just, omit certain details.

Sure. All right.

I was gonna ask you.

Just a lot of sorrow, misery from guys

it's coming in from South America?

I don't know.

Of course. Excuse me.

1213
01:26:06,042 --> 01:26:09,254
Thank you for a wonderful lunch.
It was delicious.

1214
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:15,176
What do you think of monopolies?

1215
01:26:16,386 --> 01:26:17,553
You mean like the game?

1216
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:21,307
No, I just think monopolies were
made illegal in the country, Frank,

1217
01:26:21,391 --> 01:26:23,643
'cause nobody wants
to compete, you know.

1218
01:26:23,726 --> 01:26:26,771
Nobody wants to compete,
not with a monopoly.

1219
01:26:26,896 --> 01:26:29,482
I mean, you let the
dairy farmers do that,

1220
01:26:29,565 --> 01:26:31,609
half of them would be
out of business tomorrow.

1221
01:26:31,734 --> 01:26:33,194
Just trying to make a living.

1222
01:26:33,278 --> 01:26:37,865
That's your right, I mean,
it's everyone's right. It's America.

1223
01:26:38,199 --> 01:26:42,412
We just can't do it at the
unreasonable expense of others.

1224
01:26:42,745 --> 01:26:44,831
'Cause then it becomes un-American.

1225
01:26:44,914 --> 01:26:46,958
That's why the price
we pay for that gallon of milk

1226
01:26:47,041 --> 01:26:48,835
could never represent
the true cost of production

1227
01:26:48,918 --> 01:26:53,423
'cause it's got to be controlled.
It's gotta be set. It's gotta be fair.

1228
01:26:53,506 --> 01:26:56,009
Gotta be controlled by who?
I set a price that I think is fair.

1229
01:26:56,092 --> 01:26:57,453
I don't think it's fair.
You don't?

1230
01:26:57,510 --> 01:26:59,012
I don't think it's fair.
I think it's fair.

1231
01:26:59,095 --> 01:27:01,097
I mean, I know
your customers are happy, Frank,

1232
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:03,933
bunch of fucking
junkies that they are.

1233
01:27:04,017 --> 01:27:08,563
But we fellow dairy farmers out here,
Frank, are you thinking of us?

1234
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:11,024
You thinking of them?

1235
01:27:11,107 --> 01:27:13,151
The dairy farmers?
Yeah.

1236
01:27:13,234 --> 01:27:18,031

For 15 years, he was Bumpy Johnson's
driver, bodyguard and collector.

1390

He was with him when he died.

1391

He's got five brothers.
He's the oldest. And a lot of cousins.

They all living up here now,

five boroughs and Jersey.

Right there.

<i>Turner in the Bronx

1401

<i>And Huey Lucas in Bergen County
has a body shop.</i>

That's my price.

<i>for Frank's dope and Frank's money.</i>

1406

Everything about Frank's life seems
unpretentious, orderly and legitimate.

1407
01:38:32,621 --> 01:38:35,165
<i>He starts early,
gets up at 5:00 a.m.</i>

<i>Has breakfast in a diner in Harlem
every morning, usually by himself.</i>

1409
01:38:39,128 --> 01:38:40,212
<i>Then he starts work.</i>

1410
01:38:40,295 --> 01:38:43,757
<i>Takes a meeting with the accountant
or with his lawyer.</i>

1411
01:38:43,841 --> 01:38:47,094
<i>At nights, he usually stays at home.
And if he does go out,</i>

1412
01:38:47,177 --> 01:38:51,223
<i>it's to one of two clubs or a handful
of restaurants with his new wife.</i>

1413

<i>Some ball players.

<i>RICHIE: Friends, musicians.
Never, never with organized crime guys.</i>

<i>Sundays, he takes his
mother to church.</i>

1416
01:39:00,983 --> 01:39:02,526
<i>Then he drives out
and he changes</i>

1417
01:39:02,651 --> 01:39:06,655

<i>Bumpy Johnson's life wasn't typical
either, and he ran Harlem for years.</i>

1421
01:39:15,581 --> 01:39:19,084
<i>TOBACK: So you're saying that
Frank Lucas replaced Bumpy Johnson?</i>

1422
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:20,669
<i>- RICHIE: Yeah.
- TOBACK: His driver?</i>

1423
01:39:20,753 --> 01:39:23,338
<i>- RICHIE: Yeah.
- TOBACK: Sounds a little farfetched.</i>

<i>RICHIE: But is it? Is it?
Because everything he does...</i>

JONES: He's handing out turkeys, man.

1426

<i>RICHIE: He does the same as
Bumpy would have done, right?</i>

1427
01:39:29,845 --> 01:39:32,931
And who was Bumpy
most likely to teach?

1428
01:39:33,015 --> 01:39:35,100
The guy he sees every day.

<i>It's like a Sicilian family.</i>

1430
01:39:37,644 --> 01:39:41,732
He's structured his organization
to protect him in the same way.

1431
01:39:41,815 --> 01:39:43,255
And if he was with
Bumpy for so long,

1432
01:39:43,317 --> 01:39:45,944
that means he would have
spent a lot of time with Italians.

1433
01:39:46,028 --> 01:39:48,864
Definitely long enough
to learn that much.

is working for.

It's whoever's actually
bringing the heroin in.

1437
01:39:58,585 --> 01:40:05,216
Okay. So what do you have on him that will
stick in court? Because this isn't it.

1438
01:40:06,676 --> 01:40:10,513
Without powder, without informants,
no one's going to jail.

1439
01:40:11,014 --> 01:40:12,214
RICHIE: That's understood, sir.

1440
01:40:12,223 --> 01:40:15,643
And I don't think we're gonna get

01:46:41,335 --> 01:46:44,505
that is trademark infringement.
You understand what I'm saying?

1535
01:46:44,588 --> 01:46:47,091
With all due respect, Frank,
if I buy something, I own it.

1536
01:46:47,174 --> 01:46:48,467
No, that ain't true.
That ain't true.

1537
01:46:48,551 --> 01:46:50,803
If I buy a car, and I wanna paint it,
I can paint the motherfucker.

1538
01:46:50,928 --> 01:46:52,054
Yeah, but you don't have to.

1539
01:46:52,138 --> 01:46:55,182
This is what I'm saying to you, Nick, you
don't have to. Good enough the way it is.

1540
01:46:55,266 --> 01:46:58,102
You can make enough money off it the way
it is, just by calling it Blue Magic.

1541
01:46:58,185 --> 01:47:00,021
Anything more than
that is greed, son.

1542
01:47:00,104 --> 01:47:02,023
What you want, Frank?
You want me to change the name on it?

1543
01:47:02,106 --> 01:47:04,150
I would have to insist
that you change the name.

1544
01:47:04,233 --> 01:47:08,112
Fine by me, Frank. I'll call it Red Magic,
even though that don't sound as good.

1545
01:47:08,195 --> 01:47:11,075
I don't give a fuck what you call it.
Put a chokehold on the motherfucker

1546
01:47:11,157 --> 01:47:13,784
and call it Blue Dog Shit,
you know what I mean?

1547
01:47:13,868 --> 01:47:18,122
I don't care, just don't let
me catch you doing this again.

1548
01:47:18,247 --> 01:47:20,875
Catch me? Infringement?
Insist?

1549
01:47:20,958 --> 01:47:22,793
I don't like these
words as much as,

1550
01:47:22,918 --> 01:47:25,629
"Please, thank you,
I'm sorry to bother you, Nicky."

1551
01:47:25,755 --> 01:47:27,882
These are better words you use to come
to my motherfucking club

1552
01:47:27,965 --> 01:47:30,551
without an invitation! You hear me?

1553
01:47:31,510 --> 01:47:32,803
My man.

1554
01:47:41,354 --> 01:47:44,357
Oh, shit. Fuck,
is that the cops there, man?

1555
01:47:53,366 --> 01:47:54,992
It's all right.

1556
01:47:56,077 --> 01:47:58,996
The hell they're gonna do,
give us a ticket?

1557
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:01,374
Stuff's in the car, Frank.

1558
01:48:03,250 --> 01:48:04,293
What?

1559
01:48:04,377 --> 01:48:06,545
Some of it's in the trunk.

1560
01:48:07,825 --> 01:48:10,066
How you doing, Frank?
I'm good. How you doing, Detective?

1561
01:48:10,091 --> 01:48:11,550
How was your Thanksgiving?

1562
01:48:11,634 --> 01:48:14,275
Not so good, as a matter of fact.
Why don't you get out of the car?

1563
01:48:19,424 --> 01:48:20,785
Come on, give me the fucking keys.

1564
01:48:20,810 --> 01:48:23,062
Where's the Shelby at?
The Shelby's gone, Frank.

1565
01:48:23,145 --> 01:48:24,563
The Shelby's gone?
Stay right there.

1566
01:48:24,647 --> 01:48:26,565
Yes, sir. Right here.

1567
01:48:27,373 --> 01:48:29,293

worth looking at in here?

1568

- RICHIE: Yeah.

1572
01:48:37,535 --> 01:48:39,995
Come over here a minute, Frank.
Yeah.

1573
01:48:42,111 --> 01:48:43,391
What are we gonna do about this?

1574
01:48:43,416 --> 01:48:45,835
We don't do shit about it. We close
it up, throw it back in the trunk,

1575
01:48:45,918 --> 01:48:48,546
everybody go home, have some
pumpkin pie, warm apple cider.

1576
01:48:48,629 --> 01:48:50,464
I got a better idea.

1577
01:48:51,590 --> 01:48:54,969
Or would you rather me throw you
and your brother in the fucking river?

1578
01:48:55,052 --> 01:48:58,139
Would you rather your house
blows up next time?

1579
01:49:02,309 --> 01:49:04,603
I loved that car.
I know.

1580
01:49:07,898 --> 01:49:11,026
RICHIE: What's he doing? Shakedown!

1581
01:49:11,684 --> 01:49:13,853
Somebody's getting some money
for the Benevolent Fund.

1582
01:49:13,936 --> 01:49:15,017
SPEARMAN: Look at that shit.

1583
01:49:15,646 --> 01:49:16,981
Sorry, Frank.

1584
01:49:17,064 --> 01:49:19,316
It's all right.
Go and get in the car.

01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:21,318
(CAR ENGINE STARTING)

1586
01:49:42,715 --> 01:49:45,176
RICHIE: All right, you call me back.

1587
01:49:46,469 --> 01:49:50,597
INS, IRS, FBI. I can't get a
damn thing out of any of them.

1588
01:49:50,598 --> 01:49:56,103
Because they all think you're on
the take. And you think they are.

1589
01:49:56,187 --> 01:49:59,106
You know, I don't think
they want this to stop.

1590
01:49:59,190 --> 01:50:01,609
I think it employs too many people.

1591
01:50:01,692 --> 01:50:07,823
Judges, lawyers, cops, politicians,
prison guards, probation officers.

1592
01:50:07,952 --> 01:50:09,592
They stop bringing dope
into this country,

FBI. Here to see Detective Roberts.

1596
01:50:26,717 --> 01:50:30,471
So who took it out? Somebody I know?
My wife?

1597
01:50:31,805 --> 01:50:35,226
Come on, if somebody's taking a contract
out on my life, I'd like to know.

1598
01:50:35,309 --> 01:50:38,896
I can't say without compromising
our source. You understand?

1599
01:50:38,979 --> 01:50:41,398
No. Not when it's my life,
I don't understand.

1600
01:50:41,482 --> 01:50:44,735
If you want we can assign someone to you.

is dangerous enough as it is.

1602

Well, we'll let you get back
to your business.

1603
01:50:52,326 --> 01:50:56,789
Okay. Larry, Bob.
Thanks for visiting The Garden State.

1604
01:50:56,872 --> 01:50:57,957
Take care.

1605
01:50:58,040 --> 01:51:00,417
Hey, what do you know
about Frank Lucas?

1606
01:51:00,501 --> 01:51:03,921
We know that you keep
calling about him.

Hey, Joey. Hi.

1613
01:51:41,166 --> 01:51:44,003
All right. Yeah, tomorrow. Why?

1614
01:52:02,521 --> 01:52:03,961
RICHIE: What the fuck is a microwave?

1615
01:52:04,923 --> 01:52:08,010
JOEY: It's a scientific force,
like atomic energy.

1616
01:52:08,093 --> 01:52:09,970
- Yeah?
- JOEY: Yeah.

1617
01:52:10,053 --> 01:52:12,139
It rearranges the molecules.

Stick it in. Go on.

1621
01:52:23,608 --> 01:52:25,694
I can get you one of those.

1622
01:52:25,777 --> 01:52:29,114
Brand new, just like this.
I'll have it delivered.

1623

No, thank you.

1624
01:52:40,709 --> 01:52:42,753
Hey. Where is that?

1625
01:52:42,836 --> 01:52:47,215
Aspen. We just got back.
Had a great time. You know who we met?

1626
01:52:47,299 --> 01:52:49,051
Who?

1627
01:52:49,134 --> 01:52:50,969
Burt Reynolds.

1628
01:52:51,053 --> 01:52:54,806
Yeah? Yeah?
Yeah. I'm not kidding.

1629
01:52:54,890 --> 01:52:58,852
A lot people from Hollywood go up there
now. They're buying up everything.

1630
01:52:58,935 --> 01:53:00,604
This is your place?
Mmm.

1631
01:53:00,687 --> 01:53:04,566
You know what that's worth?
Ski in, ski out. Five bedrooms.

1632
01:53:04,649 --> 01:53:07,778
Sauna. Everything. We were guests.

1633
01:53:12,491 --> 01:53:14,159
It's your place.

1634
01:53:29,257 --> 01:53:31,802
Isn't there something
we can do,

1635
01:53:33,637 --> 01:53:36,473
about leaving the big guy alone?

1636
01:53:36,556 --> 01:53:38,517
You know who I mean.

1637
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:42,187
I don't report what you just said,
I can get in a lot of trouble.

1638
01:53:42,270 --> 01:53:45,107
I do report it,
then the trouble is yours.

1639
01:53:47,275 --> 01:53:49,611
I'm hoping you won't do that.

1640
01:53:50,404 --> 01:53:52,989
Richie, come on. I'm not taping it.

1641
01:53:53,073 --> 01:53:56,159
How do you know?
Because we're friends.

1642
01:53:56,243 --> 01:53:58,703
And I'm telling you,
this is a real offer.

1643
01:53:58,787 --> 01:54:00,705
From who? Your uncle?

1644
01:54:04,376 --> 01:54:06,920
Why would you do this?
Why would you risk our friendship?

1645
01:54:07,003 --> 01:54:08,380
Because

1646
01:54:10,632 --> 01:54:12,968
I care what happens to you.

1647
01:54:15,011 --> 01:54:16,888
You shouldn't have done this.

1648
01:54:16,972 --> 01:54:20,183
I had to, I had no choice.
Neither do you. Richie!

1649
01:54:20,892 --> 01:54:24,729
You don't have a choice.
Just leave Frank Lucas alone.

Frank Lucas?

1651

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

(SCOFFS)

1664
01:56:06,831 --> 01:56:10,210
What are you saying?
That because you were honest

1665
01:56:10,293 --> 01:56:13,505
and you didn't take money
like every other cop, I left you?

1666
01:56:13,588 --> 01:56:16,132
No, you don't take money
for one reason.

1667
01:56:16,216 --> 01:56:19,427
To buy being dishonest
about everything else.

1668
01:56:19,511 --> 01:56:21,555
And that's worse than taking money
nobody gives a shit about.

1669
01:56:21,638 --> 01:56:24,933
Drug money, gambling money
nobody's gonna miss.

1670
01:56:25,016 --> 01:56:28,520
You know, I'd rather you took it
and been honest with me.

1671
01:56:28,603 --> 01:56:31,314
Or don't take it. I don't care.
But then don't go cheat on me.

1672
01:56:31,398 --> 01:56:33,358
Don't cheat on your kid
by never being around.

01:56:33,441 --> 01:56:37,654
Don't go out and get laid by your snitches
and your secretaries and strippers!

I can tell by just looking,
she's one of them.

You...

1676
01:56:41,825 --> 01:56:46,454
You think you're going to heaven
because you're honest, but you're not.

You're going to the same hell

TRUPO: Hey.
Help me outwith this.

2005
02:17:45,813 --> 02:17:48,274
That was a military
transport plane.

2006
02:17:48,399 --> 02:17:49,567
If there was heroin on board,

2007
02:17:49,650 --> 02:17:51,485
then someone in the military
would have to be involved.

2008
02:17:51,569 --> 02:17:56,031
Which means that even as it fights a war
that's claimed 50,000 American lives,

2009
02:17:56,115 --> 02:17:58,492
the military is
smuggling narcotics.

2010

That is how this event today
will be interpreted.

2011

That someone employed
by this office

2012
02:18:03,080 --> 02:18:06,667
believes that the United States Army
is in the drug trafficking business

2013
02:18:06,750 --> 02:18:10,129
and is trying to prove it by
desecrating the remains of young men

2014
02:18:10,212 --> 02:18:13,132
who have given their lives
in the defense of democracy!

2015
02:18:13,215 --> 02:18:15,759
There is dope on that plane.
Shut the fuck up!

2016
02:18:17,261 --> 02:18:20,639
Is it any wonder, then,
because of your actions,

2017
02:18:20,723 --> 02:18:22,933
the entire federal narcotics
program is now in jeopardy

2018
02:18:23,017 --> 02:18:26,020
of being dismantled as completely
and enthusiastically

2019
02:18:26,103 --> 02:18:27,938
as that fucking transport plane?

2020
02:18:28,022 --> 02:18:30,524
That is what you've accomplished,
Mr. Roberts, single-handedly.

2021
02:18:30,608 --> 02:18:32,693
I had good information.

2022
02:18:32,776 --> 02:18:36,322
That the target of my investigation
was bringing dope in on that plane.

2023
02:18:36,405 --> 02:18:38,324
And that target is?
Frank Lucas.

2024
02:18:38,407 --> 02:18:40,534
Who?
His name's Frank Lucas.

2025
02:18:40,618 --> 02:18:43,204
Who is Frank Lucas?
Who does he work for? Which family?

Is that supposed to be
some kind of a joke?

2029
02:18:51,629 --> 02:18:53,881
You're this close to the end of
your career in law enforcement

2030
02:18:53,964 --> 02:18:56,592
and you're making
fucking jokes?

2031
02:18:56,675 --> 02:18:59,011
My investigation indicates

2032
02:18:59,136 --> 02:19:02,556
that Frank Lucas is above the
Mafia in the dope business.

2033
02:19:02,640 --> 02:19:04,183
My investigations also indicate

2034
02:19:04,266 --> 02:19:08,437
that Frank Lucas buys direct
from a source in Southeast Asia.

2035
02:19:08,520 --> 02:19:11,690
He cuts out the middlemen
and uses US military planes

2036
02:19:11,815 --> 02:19:15,653
and personnel to transport pure number
4 heroin into the United States

2037
02:19:15,736 --> 02:19:19,823
and he's been doing so
on a regular basis since 1969.

2038
02:19:19,907 --> 02:19:22,826
I have cases against
every member of Frank's organization.

they'd be soldiers. You know that.

<i>Remember those boys?
You put them out of business.</i>

2294
02:37:50,308 --> 02:37:51,726
I ain't got nothing to do
with no Mazzanos.

2295
02:37:51,809 --> 02:37:53,061
Mazzanos ain't got
nothing to do with me.

2296
02:37:53,144 --> 02:37:54,562
They got everything to do with you.
What, they...

2297
02:37:54,645 --> 02:37:55,813
You know why?
Why?

2298
02:37:55,897 --> 02:37:58,900
Because apart from the fact
that they hate you personally,

2299
02:37:58,983 --> 02:38:00,234
they hate what you represent.

2300
02:38:00,318 --> 02:38:03,905
I don't represent nothing but Frank Lucas.
You sure?

2301
02:38:03,988 --> 02:38:06,074
A black businessman like you?

2302
02:38:06,157 --> 02:38:08,368
You represent progress.

2303
02:38:08,451 --> 02:38:11,913
The kind of progress that's going
to see them lose a lot of money.

2304
02:38:11,996 --> 02:38:15,625
With you out of the way,
everything can return to normal.

2305
02:38:16,709 --> 02:38:17,960
My man.

2306
02:38:22,799 --> 02:38:25,134
You know what normal
is to me, Richie?

2307
02:38:25,218 --> 02:38:28,304
I ain't seen normal since
I was six years old.

2308
02:38:29,639 --> 02:38:32,266
Normal is seeing the police
right up to my house

2309
02:38:32,350 --> 02:38:35,311
dragging my little 12-year-old
cousin out, tying him to a pole,

2310
02:38:35,395 --> 02:38:38,564
shoving a shotgun in his mouth
so hard they bust his teeth.

2311
02:38:38,648 --> 02:38:41,943
Then they bust two shotgun shells in his
head and knock his fucking head off.

2312
02:38:42,026 --> 02:38:43,277
That's what normal is to me.

2313
02:38:43,361 --> 02:38:46,447
I didn't give a fuck
about no police then.

2314
02:38:46,531 --> 02:38:49,534
I don't give a fuck about
no police now. Shit.

2315
02:38:49,867 --> 02:38:52,161
You know what,
you can do whatever you want to do.

2316
02:38:52,245 --> 02:38:54,747
So, it don't mean nothing to me
for you to show up tomorrow morning

2317
02:38:54,831 --> 02:38:57,750
with your head blown off.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

2318
02:38:57,834 --> 02:39:03,256
Yeah, Frank. Get in line.
That one stretches around the block, too.

2319
02:39:06,676 --> 02:39:08,010
All right.

2320
02:39:11,806 --> 02:39:13,266
What do you want to do?

2321
02:39:19,814 --> 02:39:21,482
You know what you got to do.

2322
02:39:21,566 --> 02:39:23,359
What do you want me to do?
Snitch, huh?

2323
02:39:23,443 --> 02:39:24,944
I know you don't want me
to give up no cops.

2324
02:39:25,027 --> 02:39:27,113
What do you want?
You want gangsters?

2325
02:39:27,196 --> 02:39:30,992
Pick one. Jew gangsters?
Mick gangsters? Guineas?

2326
02:39:31,451 --> 02:39:34,203
They've been bleeding Harlem dry
since they got off the boat, Richie.

2327
02:39:34,287 --> 02:39:38,124
I don't give a fuck about no crime
figures. You can have them.

2328
02:39:39,208 --> 02:39:40,793
I'll take them, too.

2329
02:39:40,877 --> 02:39:42,795
You'll take them, too?

2330
02:39:47,925 --> 02:39:51,637
No, you didn't. You're talking
about police. You want police?

2331
02:39:52,221 --> 02:39:53,264
You want your own kind?

2332
02:39:53,347 --> 02:39:55,308
They're not my kind.

2333
02:39:55,391 --> 02:39:58,102
They're in business with you, Frank.
They ain't my kind.

2334
02:39:58,186 --> 02:40:02,106
They ain't my kind like the
Italians are not yours. All right?

2335
02:40:05,359 --> 02:40:06,402
Huh.

2336
02:40:15,703 --> 02:40:18,122
What can you promise me, Richie?

2337
02:40:21,083 --> 02:40:24,545
I can promise you,
you lie about one name,

2338
02:40:24,629 --> 02:40:26,547
you'll never get out of prison.

2339
02:40:26,631 --> 02:40:29,383
You lie about one dollar,
in one offshore account,

2340
02:40:29,467 --> 02:40:31,761
you'll never get out of prison.

2341
02:40:32,845 --> 02:40:37,099
Now you can live life rich in jail
for the rest of your born days,

2342
02:40:37,600 --> 02:40:40,228
or be poor outside
for some of them.

2343
02:40:41,145 --> 02:40:43,481
That's what I can promise you.

2344
02:40:46,317 --> 02:40:52,490
I want them cops, Richie.
That's what I want, I want them cops

2345
02:40:53,783 --> 02:40:57,036
that took that money
out of my pockets.

2346
02:40:59,747 --> 02:41:01,332
Him, too.

2347
02:41:01,415 --> 02:41:03,334
All right. Okay.

2348
02:41:05,169 --> 02:41:07,463
Hey, Spearman? Spearman.

2349
02:41:08,089 --> 02:41:10,675
So these guys are all connected up
to Gwynn, all right.

2350
02:41:10,800 --> 02:41:13,427
See this guy here,
he's in uniform...

Oh, shit. Yeah.
You all right?

Expensive sneakers.
About $100 a pair.

is give you a ride home.

Yeah, you sure did that.
You gave me a ride home. Free ride.

What?

2411
02:47:42,775 --> 02:47:45,778
Ain't nothin', man.
Ain't nothin', man.

2412

That's life right there.
That's life right there.
