过这边来
Come here.

11
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,870
这就是美国的问题所在
This is the problem. this is what's wrong with America.

12
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,200
它变得太大  大到让人迷失自我
It's gotten so big, you just can't find your way.

13
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,110
从前街角的杂货铺现在变成了超市
The grocery store on the corner is now a supermarket.

14
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,550

还有这里  他妈的超级折扣店

16
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,900
作为私营业主的那种自豪哪去了?
Where's the pride of ownership, huh?

17
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,100
私人服务哪去了?
Where's the personal service?

18
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,900
懂我意思吗  操
You see what I mean? shit.

19
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:16,410
他们哪来的权力去砍掉供应商
I mean, what right do they have, of cutting out the suppliers,

20
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,950
挤走中间商
Pushing out all the middlemen,

21
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,080
从厂家手里直接订货?
Buying direct from the manufacturer?

22
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,890
索尼  东芝
Sony this, toshiba that.

23
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,930
这些黄种人抢走了美国人的饭碗
All them chinks putting Americans out of work.

24
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,730
这就是现实
That's the way it is now.

25
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,170
你没事吧?
You all right?

26
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,080
你无法找到问题的症结
You can't find the heart of anything

27
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,920
也根本无从下手去解决问题
To stick the knife.

28
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,420
嘿
Hey!

29

别麻烦了  弗兰克
Forget it, frank.

33
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,500
没人管事
There's no one in charge.

34
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,140
叫救护车
Call an ambulance!

35
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,780
有人说邦比·强森是个好人

一个为人民服务的人

38
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,010
没人在他们的悼词中
No one chose to use in their remembrances

39
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,090
把邦比·强森

和黑帮头目联系在一起

Regarded by some as the robin hood of harlem,

51
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,050
另一些人认为他是残忍的罪犯
By others as a ruthless criminal...

52
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,880
我不明白
I don't understand, you know.

53
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,220
我原以为邦比会有更大的发展
I would've thought that bumpy would put out a better spread, you know?

I'm sure bumpy didn't say anything to you, but he made me promise

They think I'm gonna forget to collect, but I'm gonna get that money.

81

Class, you'll be critiquing Mr. roberts, so pay attention.

86
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,540
我讨厌被叫到名字
I hate hearing my name called, you know?

87
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,580
那意味着我要站到前面去  转过身
It means I gotta get up in front of the class, I gotta turn around,

88
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,780
而且我明白他们每个人都知道的比我多
And I know every one of those people there, they know more than I do.

89
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,880
人最怕的不是死亡而是当众演讲
The number one fear of people, it ain't dying, it's public speaking.

90
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,390

这可是你谋生之路啊

I swear to god, richie, I didn't know it was you.

否则绝不会关门夹你的手
I would never slam a door on your hand, knowingly.

105

你他妈是咬了我的手
You bit my fucking hand.

106
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,020
你怎么发起传票来了?
What are you doing serving subpoenas, anyway?

107
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,120
-我们欠县里钱  -县里?

How's that working out for you? hey, fuck you.

109

对不起  这传票我收下了  到此为止吧
Hey, I'm sorry. consider me served. can we leave it there?

110
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,500
你这可是袭警  算了?  没那么容易
Assault on a police officer? I don't think so.

111
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,860

141
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,960

It's the groovy sound of the jefferson kaye saturday night show.

143
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,660
接下来是新闻时间
Dig, honey, it's coming up time for news.

144
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,430
这里是WBZ广播电台
Jumping on the ceiling, wallpaper peeling on wbz.

145
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,800
别走开  我们的节目10点开始  10点见
Stick around, the jace-man's got 10. back in 10.

146
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,100
这可不是零花钱  知道吗?
It's not just a couple of bucks, all right?

147
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,840
从原则上讲是一样的
It's the same thing in principle.

148
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,150
我们现在是在按原则办事吗?
Oh, are we talking principles?

149
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,710
瑞奇  一个把这么多钱上交的警察
Richie, a cop who turns in this kind of money, says one thing.

150
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:18,550
肯定会告发其他警察收黑钱  我们以后还用混?
He turns in cops who take money. we'll be fucking pariahs.

151
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,130
反正我们里外不是人
Yeah, well, then we're fucked both ways.

152
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,990
如果我们留下这笔钱就不会这样
Not if we keep it. only if we don't, then you're right, we're fucked.

153
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,000
只要我们留下钱就没事
But not if we keep it.

154
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,300
靠  现在是天上掉馅饼啊
God damn it, man! did we ask for this?

155
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,370
我们有拿抢指着人说"抢钱"吗?
Did we put a gun to someone's head and say, "give us your money"?

156
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,240
警察会杀了那些他们不信任的警察
Cops kill cops they can't trust.

157
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,870
我们不能上交
We can't turn it in, man.

158
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,990
你相信吗?
Can you believe that?

159
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,600
有多少?
How much is it?

160
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,540
九十八万七千美元
$987,000.

161
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,910
其他的钱呢?
Well, what happened to the rest of it?

162
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,540
你在干什么
What the hell are you doing

163
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:14,840
当着大家的面数钱?
Counting it out here in front of everybody?

164
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:15,940
你发神经了?
Are you nuts?

165
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,750
装回袋子里  贴上封条  放财务室去
Get it back in the bags, seal them up and down into the property room.

166
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,020
操他的假清高
You fucking boy scout.

167
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,250
干嘛?  干嘛?
What? what?

168
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,250
特普探长请在这签名
Detective trupo, sign here.

169
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,220
你们做好发大财的准备吗?

还有3条船
There's three more boats.

176
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,970
别留下任何东西
Hey, don't lose any of that shit.

177
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,410
-我知道  -小心
Man 1: I know. all right, be careful.

178
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,920
只要够试剂测试用就可以了
Hey! just enough for the reagent test.

179
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,420
少放点
A little less.

180
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,430
这是从法国运过来的毒品
This is the french connection dope.

181
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:18,830
艾迪和索尼从我们这拿走很多这样的货
Kilos of the same dope eddie egan and sonny grosso took from us.

182
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,200
警察抓到了  逮捕了每个人
The cops seize it, arrest everyone,

183
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,710
后来把毒品从证物室拿出来
Then they start taking it out of the evidence room,

184
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,300
掺入很多其它的东西再卖回给我们
Whacking it down to nothing and selling it back to us.

185
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,810
靠这个他们基本控制了整个市场
They basically control the market with it.

186
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,480
罗斯先生  我有惊喜给你
Mr. rossi, I have a surprise for you.

187
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,610
他们干这个有些年头了  靠我们的毒品发财
They've been doing it for years now. they live off it, our dope.

188
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,710
你有何想法?
What do you think?

189
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,720
弗兰克  这世界到底怎么了?
What the fuck is happening to the world, frank?

190
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,820
那些该死的骗子
Those fucking crooks.

191
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,290
我为邦比感到难过
Yeah. sad about bumpy.

192
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,030
哈林区永远都不会再和从前一样了
Things are never gonna be the same in harlem.

193
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:53,160
在外面没人敢惹你  因为邦比搞定了一切
You walk down the street, nobody bothers you 'cause bumpy was making sure of it.

194
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,810
来一斤
Half a key.

195
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,970
现在过得怎样?
How is your day now?

196
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,040
一片混乱  人人为己
It's chaos. every gorilla for hisself.

197
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,380
操
Motherfucker!

198
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,820
这可怎么活呀?  黑社会必须要有秩序
Who can live like that? there has to be order.

199
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,060
在意大利黑帮绝不会这样
That would never happen with italians.

200
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:16,890
秩序高于任何人的生命
More important than any one man's life, is order.

201
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,270
弗兰克

202
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,870
请进  克劳德  坐

谢谢  弗兰克
Thanks, frank.

215
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,230
放松
Just relax.

216
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:38,710
这玩意儿得分几次注射
You have to boot this shit a couple of times.

217
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,450
警察总是往里头掺东西  卖给我们这破玩意儿
The cops keep cutting it, selling the shit.

218
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,650
我没什么好说的  价格合适
I don't want to say anything, cause the price is right,

219
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,950
可越南那边的货
But that shit in nam is way,

220
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:55,750
可比这玩意儿强多了
Way heavy.

221
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,750
弗兰克  你没看到那个收钱的钱罐?
Did you ain't seen the jar, frank, hmm?

222
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,980
我想你明明从它前面经过
I think you walked right past it.

223
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:29,690
难道要我在上头贴上标签不成?
The money jar, frank. what do I gotta do, put a fucking sign on it?

224
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,290
看看这黑鬼  你应该知道
Look at this nigger right here. you know, frank,

225
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,600
邦比不再拥有116街区了
bumpy don't own 116th no more.

226
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,600
哈林区已经没有邦比的地盘
bumpy don't own no real estate in harlem right now.

227
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,510
现在我是地主  租金是20%
I'm the landlord and the lease is 20%% .

228
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,340
那就别再卖毒品了 找份正当工作
Look, don't sell dope then, frank. get a real job.

229
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,610
你需要工作  那不就是你需要的么?
You need a fucking job, frank? hmm? is that what you need?

230
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,050
你可以帮我干活
Well, you can come work for me.

231
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,160
好不?  帮我开车  开门什么的
Okay? you can drive me around, huh? you can open my doors.

232
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:01,390
鞍前马后  端茶递水
Huh? "yes, sir", "no, sir", "right away, sir", "anything you want, massa johnson".

233
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,190
20%
Twenty percent.

234
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,970
我的利润也就20%  谭哥
Twenty percent is my profit, tango.

235
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,040
如果都给你我就一点都不剩了
If I give you that, then what do I got left? nothing, man.

236
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,580
抽20%我就没有活路了
Twenty percent puts me out of business,

237
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,550
你认识的所有人都被逼得会走投无路
And every somebody you know out of business.

238
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:26,010
做事要守规矩  谭哥  你这是不守规矩
There's legitimate ways of doing things, tango, and then there's this way.

239
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,310
邦比在时都不会收20%
Not even bumpy took 20%% .

240
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,360
邦比已经翘辫子了
bumpy's fucking dead.

241
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,090
你这家伙
My man.

242
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,860
20%是吧?
Twenty percent?

243
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,470
那我就给20%  德克  我们走
Twenty percent. doc, let's go.

244
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,390
吐  干的好  坐
Out. good job. sit.

245
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,930
领导者就像牧羊人
A leader, like a shepherd,

246
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,070
他把最敏捷的羊打头阵
He sends his fastest nimble sheep, out front.

247
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,000
其他的就会跟着走
And the others will follow.

248
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,540
牧羊人静静地跟在头羊后面走
While the shepherd, he walks quietly behind it.

249
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,200
好孩子  这边
Here, boy! here we go. right here.

250
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,800
拿过来
Bring it here. yeah.

251
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,980
牧羊人在需要的时候
Now he's got the stick, and the cane, he'll use it!

252
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,450
使用手中的赶羊棍
If he has to.

253
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,890
但大多时候不需要
But most times he doesn't have to.

254
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,760
他不动声色却控制着整个羊群
He moves the whole herd quietly.

255
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,070
他们有什么权力砍掉供应商?
What right do they have cutting out the supplier?

256
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,830
和中间商  直接进货
The middleman. buying direct.

257
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,500
让美国人失业
Putting Americans out of work.

258
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,470
弗兰克  这就是现实
That's the way it is now, frank.

259
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,850
这就是现实
That's the way it is.

260
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:22,330
现在越南的毒品问题不只是大麻
The drug problem in vietnam is more than marijuana.

261
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,670
据估计估计有三分之一
At this point, it is estimated that one third

262
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,970
的美国士兵吸食
Of American troops are experimenting

263
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,900
鸦片和海洛因
With opium and heroin.

264
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,480
权威人士称他们已没收
The authorities say they have confiscated

265
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:35,110
大量大麻  海洛因何迷幻药等毒品
Large quantities of marijuana, heroin and pills.

266
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,320
每个通过这扇门的人和车辆都会
Every person and every vehicle going through the gates

267

别担心那个
You ain't got to worry about that.

352
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,160
你在那边为谁工作?
Who do you work for in there?

353
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,830
这也不是你要担心的
You ain't got to worry about that, either.

354
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,800
那你是谁?
Who are you, really?

355
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,500

That guy didn't pull a gun on a cop, jay.

他是拿枪顶着瘾君子
That guy pulled a gun on a junkie,

做好警察的卖命钱!
Good cop work!

470
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,800
-你杀人了  -我出生入死赚来的钱
You murdered a guy! I earned it getting shot at!

却叫我帮你解围

474
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,610
事后还让我做你的帮凶啊  操
That makes me an accessory after the fact, motherfucker.

475
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:57,710
我会讲清楚的  我怎么说你报告就怎么写
I'll tell you the facts, man. just write the report the way I say it happened,

476
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:01,880
到时候  神不知  鬼不觉
And then that's the way it is, and that's how it will be.

477
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,420
我不能那么做
I can't do that.

478
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:09,190
听你的话把100万交公  现在成了瘟神
I'm a leper because I listened to you and turned in a million bucks.

479
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,060
自那以后没人愿意和我搭档
No one will work with me after that.

480
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:16,400
我可以洗脱罪名的  瑞奇  很简单
I can get off this shit, richie. that's easy.

481

全部取决于你的报告
Just write the report

482
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:21,330
我们是搭档  不要告发我啊
Between us, as partners.

483
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,570
我绝不能这么做
I can't do that.

484
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,740
嘿
Hey!

485
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,440

Stop! stop!

486
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,120

487
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,930
把后备箱打开
Open the trunk.

488
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:31,140
和平  和平  我们要和平
Peace now! peace now! peace now!

489
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,380
撤兵  撤兵  撤出越南

Get out, get out, get out of vietnam!

491
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,750
我们在竭力呼喊  停止越战
As loud as we can that the vietnam war should stop,

492
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:48,090
对美国来说停止战争
And that the best way to stop it is for the united states

493
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,930
最好的办法就是马上撤兵
To simply pack up and get out of vietnam right now.

494
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,360
怎么样?

Typically, what I see is 25%% to 45%% pure.

496
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:08,280

I mean, there's no adulterants, no alkaloids, no dilutants.

497
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,280
纯度百分之一百
It's 100%% .

498
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,850

太好了
Fabulous.

504
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:34,990
不想谈你的那些癖好  瑞奇  这些我太了解了
I'm not talking about your proclivities, richie. those I only know too well.

505
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,360
我想说的是你是个怎样的警察
I'm talking about being a cop.

506
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:39,990
你想说受贿吗
You're talking about taking money?

507
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,330
我不会那么做的  这不符合我的原则
I don't do that. it's not my thing.

508
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,930
那你和邻里的朋友关系怎么样?

00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:59,250
瑞奇  我正试图弄懂你妻子的话
Richie, I'm just trying to understand things your wife has said.

516
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,680
如果它们与事实不尽相符  请告诉我

他肯定会和她上床的
He's definitely fucking her.

520
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:11,590
你真的很在意这个  还是你想让她不好过?
Do you really care about this? or do you just not want her to win ever?

521
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,770
二楼有个会见室  我们去那里吧
You know, there's an interview room on the second floor.

522
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:21,070
-正合我意  -门只有从里面才能锁起来
That's what I thought. the door only locks from the inside.

534
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,810
午夜能回家就够幸运了  这个我们以前从没见过
I'm lucky if I get home by midnight. it's like nothing we've seen before.

535
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:41,620
我得签字吗
Something I gotta sign?

536
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,620
嗯  这里
Yeah. it's right here.

537
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,190
这个我拿走了  我会向伊塞克斯县登记的  行不?
I'm taking this with me. I'll register it with essex county, all right?

538
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:47,890
成
All right.

539
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,630
在美国民众的首号敌人是滥用毒品
America's public enemy number one in the united states is drug abuse.

540
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,970
为了痛击并最终打败这个敌人
In order to fight and defeat this enemy,

541
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:03,870
必要发动全民攻势
It is necessary to wage a new, all-out offensive.

542
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,910
联邦政府已经宣布
Federal authorities have announced their intention

543
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:09,520
打算建立专门麻醉药管理局
To establish special narcotics bureaus

544
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:12,380
在华盛顿  纽约  洛杉矶  芝加哥...
In washington, new york, los angeles, chicago...

545
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,220
一名警官如果没有同伴的支援
A detective without the support of his fellow detectives

546
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,310
真的什么事都做不了
Really can't do much.

547
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:20,660
你知道我为什么没有同伴的原因
You know why I don't have it.

548
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,160
没事的  你做了你该做的
Doesn't matter. you did what you had to do.

549
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:28,390
世界上最伟大的城市现在比老鼠窝还乱
Greatest city in the world! and it's turning into an open sewer.

550
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,200
小偷小摸  毒品交易盛行
Everybody's stealing, dealing.

551
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:37,010
就像你  做了凭良心做事却落得个这样下场
Look at you. you can't work because you did your job.

552
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:40,510
欣慰的是  还有很多像你这样诚实的警察
Good news is, you're not the only honest cop in town.

553
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:45,180
华盛顿的特殊麻醉药管理局可不是走过场的
The special narcotics bureau in washington is not a dog and pony show.

554
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:48,850
他们是动真格的  因为他们还叫我们参与
They are sincere. I know this because they want us to orchestrate it.

555
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,450
我们这边我要你来牵头
And I want you to head up things here on our end.

556
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:53,530
如果是联邦政府  我对谁报告  邮局?
If it's federal, who do I answer to, the post office?

557
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:54,920
你对我报告就行了
No, you answer to me,

558
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,460
我还有美国联邦检控官  其他没了
Me and the us attorney, nobody else.

559
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,630
你以后再也不要踏进警所半步了
You never step foot in a police station again.

560
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,730
你自己找个场所  再挑几个人
You work out of your own place, you pick your own guys,

561
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,970
你得找几个绝对可靠的人
Guys that you know would not take a nickel off the sidewalk.

562
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:35,220
好了  那边有个漂亮的过道
Well, we got the lovely transit.

563
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:40,220
六百年历史的红木门
600-year-old mahogany doors.

564
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:46,090
你看看  你感受到了吧
Now, look at that. can't you just feel it?

565
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,860
我认为很棒
I think it's lovely.

566
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:51,060
小心
Watch your step.

567
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:57,670
看看这些华丽的地板
Look at these beautiful floors.

568
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:59,770
我不确定  至少也有两百年历史了
At least, I don't know, 200 years old.

569
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,810
怎么都不会开裂
And it's hard to get the cracks...

570
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:03,740
啊  这是我最喜欢的一个房间了
Now this was one of my favorite rooms

571
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:05,910
但是下水道有些问题
But we had some problems with the plumbing.

572
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,450
不过我修理好了  现在可以了
I even fixed it. I know it works.

573
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:08,950
不会漏水了
It's not gonna leak.

574
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:15,120
就这了
Here it is.

575
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:23,030
你有所不知  我小时候
You know, I used to be a really good

576
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:24,260
钢琴弹得很好的
Piano player when I was a kid,

577
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:27,200
但是后来荒废了
But then, I don't know why I forgot.

578
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:29,770
生活还得继续啊
Life goes on. well...

579
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:35,240
你还得看多久呢
How long are you gonna be?

580
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:38,270
噢  拜托
Oh, and do me a favor, please.

581
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,440
关好这些门
Mind the doors.

582
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:43,280
那些华丽的玻璃门都很经典
Those are beautiful, ornate glass doors, you know.

583
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:52,020
再来一次  吉米  加油
Here we go, jimmy. come on.

584
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:54,190
好的  投过来
Oh, yeah. give it back.

00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:00,820

588
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,010

Who you think it is, boy?

589
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:06,820
-弗兰克  -哪个弗兰克

Frank your brother, negro. frankie?

591
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:13,690
对啦
That's right.

592
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,770
梅尔文  老妈在哪里?
Hey, melvin! melvin, where's ma?

Yeah, when? well, you just say it, man, yeah.

599
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,250
我六点钟再打
Listen, I'm gonna call y'all back

600
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,780
我要你把每个人都叫过来  懂了吗?
At 6:00. I want you to get everybody together, all right? get mama, get everybody.

601
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,620
-好的  -那先这样
All right? okay.

602
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:52,830
嘿  弗兰克!
Hey, frank!

603
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,200
怎么突然想家了啊  弗兰克?
What's happening, frank?

604
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:56,870
-嘿  弗兰克!  -过得不错吧  弗兰克叔叔
Hey, frankie. how you doing, uncle frank?

605

下车  让孩子们都下车
Get out the car. get the kids, get the kids.

606
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:02,300
瞧我的宝贝
Look at this, baby.

607
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:06,440
噢  上帝啊  见到你真是太高兴了  孩子
Oh, my lord! I'm so glad to see you, boy.

608
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:11,210
这块地可真够大的!  地方也很漂亮
Oh, I'm telling you, this is some piece of land you got here!

609
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:13,920
我们这些穷人来这儿干嘛呀?
I wonder what the poor people are doing here?

610
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:15,390
弗兰克  那房子是谁的?
And whose house is that, frankie?

611
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,660
妈妈  是你的
That is your house, mama.

612
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,430
-我的?  -是的
Mine? that's yours.

613
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,960
还能是谁的呢?
And who else?

614
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:28,400
过来  我的房间在那里  就那里
Now, there, that's my room right there, man. right over there.

615
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,950
还要来点甘蓝吗?
Anybody want some more collard greens?

616
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:43,090
看到所有的孩子和孙子坐在一起用餐
I wanna tell you how happy I am to see all my children at the table

617
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:45,660
我甭提多开心了
And the grandchildren at the same time.

618
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,520
-真是太开心了  你们多吃点
My heart's so happy. enjoy yourselves.

619
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:49,120
在吃着呢  奶奶
Right on, grandma.

620
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,200
瞧你真能吃  我希望你能找份工作  孩子
I hope you got a job, boy, the way you're eating over here.

621
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:56,170
那边的那个男孩  他的手臂真适合打棒球
That boy right there, he got a arm on him. I mean, a major league arm.

622
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,270
是吗
Oh, yeah?

623
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:58,800
难道不是吗
Ain't that right?

624
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:00,030
继续啊  爸
Right on, pop.

625
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:02,670
晚餐后  让你他露两手啊
Well, we'll see after dinner. we'll see him throw it around a little bit.

626
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:04,470
还是不要啦  你抓不到他的球的
No, no, you can't catch him, man.

627
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:05,940
我是说  我是说
I'm talking about... I'm talking about...

628
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:07,710
这小子投的球比吉布森的还势大力沉
This guy throw harder than gibson.

629
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:10,110
球速高达每小时95英里
We're talking 95 miles an hour.

630
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,490
-你能抓得住?  -他会...
Can you catch him? he gonna...

631
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:14,110
他只会抓到小草
He gonna catch the ground.

632
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:16,880
我记得我五岁的时候  我们好像一起玩过
We might've played catch, I think, when I was about five years old.

633
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,360
从那时起  他就一直玩不过我们了
Since then, he ain't been able to keep up.

634
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,860
这是你的房间  太完美了
This is your room. it's perfect.

635
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:27,800
啊
Oh. why, it's...

636
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:30,160
你看看这里
Will you look at this?

637
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:31,840
噢
Oh!

638
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:35,740
真是太完美了
Oh, it's beautiful. it's beautiful. it's just...

639
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,330
我
I...

640
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,410
怎么会有这个
How did you...

641
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,750
我请人做的
I had it made.

642
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,050
凭记忆
From memory.

643
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:52,350
-他们搬走它的时候你才五岁  -是的
You were five when they took it away on me. that's right.

644
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:53,620
你怎么还记得啊
How could you remember it?

645
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:55,320
我怎么会玩得了呢  妈妈
How could I forget, mama?

646
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:03,560
我正想说  太完美了
I'll just tell you it is perfect.

647
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:06,330
一切都太完美了
It's all perfect.

648
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:14,040
我很爱你  孩子
I can't tell you how much I love you.

649
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:15,880
我也爱你  妈妈
I love you, too, mama.

650
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:17,780
真是太好了
It's okay.

651
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,620
这两个家伙  特擅长于窃听
Both these guys, good with wires,

652
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,350
他们有可靠的线人
They got solid informants,

653
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,950
他们都诚实而又勇敢
And they're honest and they're fearless.

654
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,030
他们都和你一样  瑞奇  都疯了
They're insane, richie, like you.

655
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:38,060
他们在哪
Where are they?

656
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:43,800
和那边高挑的女孩子在跳舞的是琼斯
That's jones with the skinny white broad.

657
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:45,570
基层警员中最棒的的
Best I ever seen on the street.

658
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,210
他了解毒品交易  但从来不碰那玩意儿
He knows dope, but he's together, all right?

659
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,720
伟人非常正直
He's a stand-up guy all round.

660
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:55,310
和那两个肥胖的黑女人在一起的是阿布鲁佐
And that's abruzzo with the two fat black ones.

661
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,880
他喜欢屁股大的女人
He loves a big ass, man.

662
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:03,590
像头蛮牛  还好不会胡闹  只是有点脾气
He's a bulldog. he don't fuck around, all right. he's got a bit of a temper,

663
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:07,100
他是绝对可靠的一个人
Yeah, but you can trust this guy with your grandmother.

664
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:09,490
瑞奇 我们合作
Listen, richie. we work together.

665
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,090
如果你要我加盟  你得把他们也带上
You want me, you gotta take them, too.

666
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,340
我们什么时候开始
When do we start?

667
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,490
我的老板拥有纽约最大的公司之一
The man I worked for, he had one of the biggest companies in new york city.

668
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:34,250
这家公司他都经营50多年了
He ran it for more than 50 years.

669
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:38,260
我跟他有十五年八个月九天了
Fifteen years, eight months and nine days,

670
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,960
我每天都待他边上  我替他卖命
I was with him every day. I worked for him,

671
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:43,830
我保护他  照顾他  也从他那学到了好多东西
I protected him, I looked after him, I learned from him.

672
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:46,970
邦比很有钱  但是他不像白人那样有钱
Bumpy was rich, but he wasn't white man rich, you see?

673
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,540
他没什么财产
He wasn't wealthy.

674
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,970
他没有自己的公司  虽然他认为他有
He didn't own his own company. he thought he did, but he didn't,

675
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:52,670
只是由他经营
He just managed it.

676
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:55,180
公司是白人的  可以说他是替白人打工
The white man owned it, so they owned him.

677
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,680
-不过我不受制于任何人的  -嘿
Nobody owns me, though. hey.

678
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,750
-宝贝  你好吗  -很好
How you doing, babe? good.

679
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:01,480
那是因为我有自己的公司  我出售自己的产品
That's 'cause I own my own company, and my company sells a product

680
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:04,250
这个没有竞争
That's better than the competition,

681
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:07,850
比竞争的代价要低
At a price that's lower than the competition.

682
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:10,430
我们在这卖什么  弗兰克?
Well, what are we selling here, frank?

683
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,870
你好吗  雷德?
How you doing, red?

684
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:29,780
这是我的兄弟  他们刚从北卡罗来纳来
These are my brothers, just got here from north carolina.

685
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,940
兄弟们  她叫雷托
Everybody, this is redtop.

686
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:32,450

-女士们  -你好
And the ladies. hey.

00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:38,290
怎么了?  没见过女人的裸体吗?
What wrong? y'all niggas ain't never seen hoochie before?

689
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,680
为什么他们都赤身裸体的?
Why are they all naked?

690
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:41,560
这样她们就偷不了东西
So they can't steal nothing.

691
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,120
噢  那倒是
Oh, right.

692
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:48,800
生意上最可贵的品质是  诚实  正直  勤奋
The most important thing in business is honesty, integrity, hard work,

693
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:51,200

Never forgetting where we came from.

See, you are what you are in this world,

697
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:06,550
不可能是其他的
That's either one of two things.

698
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,810
要么作大人物
Either you're somebody,

699
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:13,020
要么是小人物  我马上回来

Where's my money? redtop gave you the package.

706
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,780
你本来该把钱送过来给我的
You're supposed to be handing me my money.

707

粉剂毒品40千克以上才是我们的目标
No powder under 40 kilograms.

725
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,190
少于这些的  都由其他人来管
Any less than that, then somebody else can waste their time.

731
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:50,040
其实我也不爽  我每天都在后悔
So do i, you know? I think about it every day.

732
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:53,120
不然现在我应该在佛罗里达坐着68英尺长的游艇钓鱼了
I should be down in south florida with a 68-foot cruiser doing fishing charters.

733
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:54,280

这个蓝色魔法强度是普通货色的两倍
But this blue magic, twice the potency.

740

这是我见过纯度最高的

直接吸食都可以了
I ever seen in the streets. it's strong enough to smoke.

这怎么可能
So, how is that possible?

746
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:19,070
谁会把好一倍的毒品用一半的价格卖出呢
Who can afford to sell shit twice as good for half as much?

747
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,580

这衣服上就象写着"逮捕我"三个字
That says "arrest me."

784

You want to be superfly? you wanna work for him?

他想跟你谈谈
He wants to talk to you.

797
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:09,410
-聊到了你  -我什么?
Your name came up. about what?

798
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:12,570
我不知道  我就告诉他我会跟你说的
I don't know, man. I told him I'd tell you.

799
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:15,740
你知道吗  你...
You know... boy, you...

800
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:20,250
如果你不是我弟弟  我会杀了你  你知道吧
You know, if you wasn't my brother, I'd kill you. you know that, don't you?

801
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:22,080
我他妈会打爆你的头
I'd blow your motherfucking brains out.

802
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:23,210
别这样
Come on, man. don't be like that.

803
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:24,620
这星期我就带你去买衣服
I'm taking you shopping this week.

804
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,560
-我已经买了衣服了  -我看出来了
I went shopping. I can tell.

805
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:29,350
我看到你内心深处
See deep into you

806
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:34,370
我知道你现在在想什么
And know what you're thinking now

807
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,130
如果我正是你所需要的
And if I'm what you're needing

808
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,320
我需要一点暗示
I need some kind of sign

809
01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:49,420
让我知道  因为你的心思我猜不透
Let me know, cause I can't read your mind

810
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:54,100
你是否也和我一样  还是我一个人在单相思
Are you in or am I in this on my own?

811
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:56,600
我需要从你那得到一些线索
I need some clue from you

812
01:00:57,410 --> 01:00:59,070
就是点税务上的问题
It's a tax thing.

813
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:01,100
我的律师正处理呢
It's a mistake my lawyers are straightening out,

814
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:02,770
不过现在...
But for the time being...

815
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:04,540
乔  你欠了多少
How much do you owe, joe?

816
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:08,440
没多少  就...
It's nothing. it's like...

817
01:01:08,650 --> 01:01:09,780
五万
Fifty grand.

818
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:13,280

Thank you, man.

820
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:17,190
我有钱马上还...

821
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:20,690
乔  这不是借的  是我送你的
Joe, this ain't no loan. it's a gift. all right?

822
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,360
你为邦比做了那么多  我们欠你的
All you did for bumpy, we owe you.

823
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:26,030
昂起头来  骄傲的活下去好吗?
Keep your chin up. all right? okay?

824
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:27,630
你现在不过是陷入低迷而已
All you have which is down there. down.

825
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:29,170
情绪有点低落
Chin down.

826
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:31,760
先走一步了  回头见啦

你还欠我支舞  对吗
You still owe me that dance, right?

828
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,880

829
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:44,380

835

你是弗兰克  这是你的地盘?

That's right. I'm frank and this is my place.

837
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:11,710
这为什么要叫"斯莫"呢?
Why is it called small's?

838
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,640
为什么不叫弗兰克夜总会
Why don't you call it frank's?

839
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:18,640
当你拥有一样东西时  想叫它什么就叫什么
When you own something, you can call it what you want.

840
01:02:18,790 --> 01:02:20,050

844
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:30,590

这么多的头面人物
All the cheesies.

851
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:49,580
在这  对  这是谁?
Right here, here we go. what have we got here?

852
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:50,950
洗手了没?
Wash your hands?

853
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:52,250
我只有一张  别弄脏了
I got one print of that, don't smudge it.

854
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:54,120
对  就这样
Yeah. there you go.

855
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:57,500
老大  他呢  他是谁?
Hey, spearman, what about him? who is that?

856
01:02:57,610 --> 01:02:59,700
乔伊·索达诺  道恩·卡塔诺的外甥
Joey sodano. don cattano's nephew.

857
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,330
是啊  是啊  把他放在那  大人物的旁边
Yeah, yeah. put him up there by the big man.

858
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:02,850
他看起来像你叔叔  阿布鲁佐
He looks like your uncle, abruzzo.

859
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:04,070
是啊  不过他可没我叔叔帅
Yeah, but he's not as handsome.

860
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:06,380
-他看起来更像你姐姐  -"冰锥"的照片哪去了
He looks more like your sister. where's ice pick's mug?

861
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:07,510
是啊  真幽默啊你们
Yeah, that's funny.

862
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:08,850
在外头办事的时候你们也能这么幽默就好了
Maybe you guys should take that show on the road.

863
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:11,350
我们要找"冰锥"保罗
So we need ice pick paul.

864
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:12,820
-冰锥保罗?  -对
Ice pick paul? yeah.

865

在这呢  放上去
There you go. get him up.

866
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:17,090
冰锥保罗  他的地位可不低  得放到顶上去
Ice pick paul, he goes way up there, up top.

867
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:20,630
冰锥保罗只是个小兵  这位是上尉呢
No, ice pick paul, he's a fucking soldier. this guy's a lieutenant.

868
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:21,890
这怎么可能呢
How's that even fucking possible?

869
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,370
那是本尼"主教"
That's benny the bishop.

870
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:28,100
那是个小兵  这是上尉  小兵怎么可能在上面
That guy is a soldier. this guy's a lieutenant. no way that guy's on top.

871
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,000
你还在想本尼主教
You thinking of benny the bishop.

872
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:33,010
"双袜"温尼是那混蛋卡塔诺的女婿
Vinnie two socks is fucking cattano's deadbeat son-in-law.

873
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:34,200
琼斯说的没错
Jonesy's right.

874
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,440
你们谁真的见过冰锥保罗卖毒品?
Hey, which one of you guys has ever actually seen ice pick paul selling drugs?

875
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:37,910
亲眼看见他的生意一落千丈?
Actually seen it go down?

876
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:41,600
对  看见他的生意一落千丈
Yeah, seen it go down.

877
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:43,360
在他地盘  亲眼看到他处理毒品
Been in his place. seen him handle drugs.

878
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:45,370
那个线人跟我们说的...
That rat, ricky, has told us...

879
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:48,810
可惜那家伙4个星期前已经死翘翘了
He's fucking dead. about four weeks ago.

880
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:51,100
他死了
He's dead.

881
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:52,200
那  这样的话
All right, well,

882
01:03:52,310 --> 01:03:53,470
我们就能把他从这板上取下来了
We can take him off the fucking board.

883
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:58,020
这板上的任何一个我们都没有确实的证据
I don't think we got any solid evidence on anybody on that board.

884
01:03:58,650 --> 01:04:00,020
瑞奇  你什么意思
What you saying, richie?

885
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:01,550
这是我们好几星期的努力成果呢
This is weeks and weeks of work, man.

886
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:03,320
我的意思是  把它取下来
I'm saying, take it down.

887
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:05,150
我们得从街上重新开始
We got to start again from the street.

888
01:07:19,590 --> 01:07:21,110
你好  哪位

Scotty! what's going down, brother?

891
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:28,660
你昨晚给我的雪地轮胎
Those snow tires you gave me last night.

892

这单子挺大啊
That's a pretty big order.

898
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:40,100
对  我要又大又白的雪地轮胎
Yeah, I want the big whitewalls,

899
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:42,570
他们最好能驶上十万英里
They better get at least 100,000 miles.

900
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:44,610
好  这样吧
All right, I'll tell you what.

901

你明天上午来
You come in here tomorrow morning

902

我帮你装好轮胎
I'm gonna set you up real nice

903
01:07:48,550 --> 01:07:50,110
再给你些雪地轮胎特惠  好不好
With a whitewall special, all right?

904
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:51,180

没问题
No problem.

906
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:58,320
这可比你一年的工资还多啊  瑞奇
That's considerably more than one year's salary, richie.

907
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,490
如果这钱没了  我也没法再给你弄了
If it disappears, I will not be able to get it for you again.

908
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:06,040
这是你的了
That's yours.

909
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:10,580
为了这2万小钱  我得把命押上
Signing my life away again, for a lousy twenty grand.

910
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,480
货是蓝色魔法吧?
It has to be blue magic, right?

911
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:17,590
是是  肯定是蓝色
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's gonna be blue.

914
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:21,960
就放那吧
Just leave it there.

915
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:37,680
-怎么样  -还行
How'd you do? good.

916

Here he comes.

917
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:42,750
-那就是他了?  -恩
That's him? yep.

918
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:45,650
还真快
That was quick.

919
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,700
瑞奇  如果他进城了我们怎么办
Richie, if he goes in the city, what do we fucking do?

920
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:00,430
跟着那钱  我们还能怎么办
Stay with the fucking money, that's what we do.

921
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:01,600
我们跟着钱  行吧?
We stay with the money, all right?

922
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:02,970
我们不能进城啊
We can't go in the fucking city.

923
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:04,870
不能也得能  2万块在那呢
Yes, we can. that's 20 grand in there, all right,

924
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:06,940
我对那钱要负责任  不能弄丢了
That I'm responsible for. I ain't losing it.

925
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,640
但那超出了我们的管辖区
It's out of our jurisdiction!

926
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:11,180
-他妈的你给我跟着钱  -好吧  好吧
Follow the money! all right, all right, all right!

927
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:27,310
他停下了
He's pulling over.

928
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:29,470
好  我们得行动了
All right, here we go.

929
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:31,410
让我在这下吧
Let me out here.

930

那些钱有序号的 对不对？
The bills are sequenced, right?

958
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:25,060
他们被依塞克斯县法院注册过了  看看吧
They're registered with the essex county prosecutor's office. just check them out.

I thought I had a fucking chris-craft sitting in my driveway.

962

我从没去过那
Never.

967
01:13:55,930 --> 01:13:57,990
你没打声招呼就来这干嘛
What're you doing, coming over here unannounced?

968
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,530
你以为我们不会把你怎么样吗?

And never, ever come into this city again unannounced.

971
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:12,060
你就算来这看场歌剧
You come in to see a fucking broadway show,

972
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:15,290
也得跟我打声招呼先  看我答不答应
You call ahead first, see if it's okay with me.

973
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,600
没问题
No problem. all right.

这车真他妈不错
That's a fucking great car.

978

Come on, I got a tee time. let's go.

981
01:14:42,230 --> 01:14:43,920
你到那干嘛呢
What were you doin' there?

982
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:45,720
货是从那边出来的
Well, that's where this dope is coming from.

983

984
01:14:47,670 --> 01:14:49,260
你觉得我该怎么做  不管它?
What do you expect me to do, ignore it?

985
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:52,630
出租车司机要告你故意伤害加偷窃
The cab driver has filed aggravated assault and grand theft charges

986
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:54,100
他也可能会撤诉
Which he may reconsider

987
01:14:54,210 --> 01:14:57,700
不过这要看新泽西州政府给他多少钱私了
Depending on how much the state of new jersey offers to settle.

988
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:01,280
我给他看了我的证明  我告诉他我是警察了
I showed him my id. I told him I was a cop.

989

你偷了他的车还把他打晕了
You stole his cab and you knock him out.

990

我在追那2万块  好不好
I was chasing the 20 grand, all right?

Well, then this investigation's over.

994
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:20,730
你没听懂我的话
You're not listening to me.

995
01:15:20,830 --> 01:15:23,130
我说的是  "我不想再听到你去纽约了"
I said, "i don't want to hear about you going into new york again."

Made me look really bad, all right. you know,

1072
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:37,090
半夜三更随时出门  周围都是人渣线人和女人

乔叔叔  看着我
Uncle joey, watch me, okay?

1076

我懂了
Okay, I understand.

1077
01:19:50,850 --> 01:19:54,880
我会告诉他们你想要我说的  我会帮你撒谎
They ask me, I'll tell them what you want me to tell them. I'll lie for you.

1078
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:57,150
别  别撒谎  你不用撒谎
No, don't lie. you don't have to lie.

1079
01:19:57,290 --> 01:20:00,420

Sure. all right.

You know, there's something else I was gonna ask you.

1082
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:08,300
别的事
Something else.

1083
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,430
你也可以不回答
You don't have to answer if you don't want.

1084
01:20:12,670 --> 01:20:15,170
蓝色魔法  知道什么吗
Blue magic. anything?

Just a lot of sorrow, misery from guys getting put out of work, that's all.

1086
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,080

What, your guys?

1087

你知道那是从哪来的吗
You thinking about where it's coming from?

You're telling me, it's coming in from south America?

1094
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,330
我不知道
I don't know.

1095
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:46,750
我只能说  不管是谁
All I can tell you is whoever it is,

他们都在扰乱市场秩序

1097
01:20:49,210 --> 01:20:51,300
我知道的也只有这么多了
And that's all there is.

1098

I'm a lucas. good enough on a bad day, jack.

1109
01:22:56,030 --> 01:22:57,790

He's good enough on a bad day, so don't make it a bad day,

1110
01:22:57,930 --> 01:22:59,330
做事就要做的漂亮点  明白吗?
Make it a good day, you understand?

1111
01:22:59,430 --> 01:23:03,770
纽约警察  退后  退后 都老实点
Nypd, excuse me, police department. back up, baby.

1112

1113
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:11,070

Taking your ass in. where are the handcuffs?

1114
01:23:11,180 --> 01:23:13,170
我有执照的
I got a license for that, motherfucker.

1115
01:23:13,310 --> 01:23:16,440
你有吸毒的执照吗?  让让好吗
You got a license for this? excuse me, all right?

1116
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:20,580
妈的
Shit. all right! yeah!

1117
01:23:20,850 --> 01:23:22,480
你知道吗  我得逮捕你
Now, you know what? I gotta arrest you for that shit.

1118
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:23,780
这些在街上可都是抢手货啊
That shit's too good to be on the street.

1119
01:23:23,890 --> 01:23:27,660
等等  试试这个  你会改变主意的
Wait a minute, I got this for you. you ain't got to arrest nobody.

1120
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:29,460
你在贿赂我吗
Are you bribing me now?

1121
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:32,160
我告诉你  我今天要逮捕每一个人
I'll tell you what, I'm arresting everybody!

1122
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:34,100
每一个人知道吗!  就他妈先拿你开刀
Now, all you're under arrest! you first!

1123
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,760
这是我家人  那是
That's my family. that's my...

1124
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:36,930
借过  借过
Excuse me, excuse me.

1125
01:23:39,470 --> 01:23:41,130
真不错  宝贝
Back it up, baby.

1126
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:42,300
那是什么鬼东西
What was that?

1127
01:23:42,410 --> 01:23:44,100
伙计  你他妈怎么了
Come on, guys. what's the matter with you, man?

1128
01:23:44,210 --> 01:23:45,770
我再问一次  那是什么鬼东西
I said, what the hell was that? what was what?

1129
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:47,470
-你究竟想干嘛  -冷静  哥们
I said what the hell are you doing, man? be cool, man!

1130
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:48,780
你他妈到底怎么回事
What's your fucking problem?

1131
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,610
你哪根筋不对了
What the hell's wrong with you?

1132
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:52,510
我操
Goddamn!

1133
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:55,810
他死不了  我只是射了他的腿而已
He's all right. I just shot him in the leg, is all.

1134
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:57,720
操  吉米
Damn, jimmy!

1135
01:23:58,590 --> 01:23:59,790
你给我起来
Get up.

1136
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:16,340
都出去  都他妈给我出去
All right, everybody, get out! get out!

1137
01:24:17,410 --> 01:24:18,900
算了  弗兰克  意外而已
Come on, frank, it was an accident.

1138
01:24:19,050 --> 01:24:20,710
-根本就不是什么意外  -他很后悔
It wasn't no goddamn accident. he feels terrible.

1139
01:24:20,850 --> 01:24:24,210
他才不会  你看看毒品把他搞成那个鬼样
He don't feel shit, 'cause he's coked up all the motherfucking time!

1140
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:26,340
他是你司机  开除他
He's your driver. get rid of him.

1141
01:24:26,450 --> 01:24:27,420
嘿  哥们  那可是你的堂兄啊
Come on, man, that's your cousin!

1142
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,510
管我鸟事
That ain't shit to me!

1143
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:29,650
他?  对我来说什么都不是
He don't mean nothing to me.

1144
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:30,690
那你让他怎么办?  回家种地吗
What's he gonna do, go back home?

1145
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:32,310
我才不管他死活
I don't give a damn what he does!

1146
01:24:32,430 --> 01:24:34,480
就让他滚回家去种地吧
Send his ass home! hey! hey! hey!

1147
01:24:34,590 --> 01:24:36,560
不要擦它  你别把它弄脏了
Hey! don't rub on that! you blot that!

1148
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:38,060
你知道吗  那他妈是羊绒毛的
You understand? that's alpaca!

1149
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:41,660
25000美金的羊绒毛地毯就他妈被你弄成那样了
That's $25,000 alpaca! you blot that shit!

1150
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:44,000
别他妈擦了  用苏打水洗掉吧
You don't rub it! put the club soda on there.

1151
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:46,040
一群白痴
Simple simon-ass motherfuckers.

1152
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:49,340
听着  从现在开始都别惹我
Listen, from now on, don't nobody talk to me directly! you understand?

1153
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:53,070
有事情跟休伊说  然后休伊再来告诉我
You got business with me, you talk to huey! huey, you talk to me! you got it?

1154
01:24:53,210 --> 01:24:54,200
好吧
All right.

1155
01:24:54,310 --> 01:24:55,680
不要用电话  要当面说  明白吗
Damn it, never on the phone! you got it?

1156
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:57,010
知道了  知道了
I got it. all right!

1157
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,520
把他妈的太阳镜取下来
And take them goddamn sunglasses off.

1158
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:01,180
把他妈的太阳镜取下来
Take the goddamn sunglasses off!

1159
01:25:01,290 --> 01:25:02,850
干嘛啊
Damn it, man.

1160
01:25:05,090 --> 01:25:07,460
一群白痴
Simple simon-ass motherfuckers.

1161
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:25,410
这里整个地方都是进口的
The whole place was imported.

1162
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:27,610
每一块砖都是
Brick by brick.

1163
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:29,770
格罗切斯特郡
Gloucestershire.

1164
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:33,080
-哪儿?  -英国
Who? great britain.

1165
01:25:33,690 --> 01:25:35,050
到你了
Yours.

1166
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:41,580
准备好了
Here you go.

1167
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:46,990
放靶！
Pull!

1168
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:54,300
好了  伊娃
Come, eva.

1169
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:58,170
来参观下这房子吧
I'm sure you're dying to see the rest of the house.

1170
01:26:01,950 --> 01:26:04,440
当然  失陪了
Of course. excuse me.

1171
01:26:05,690 --> 01:26:08,620
非常感谢你们的招待
Thank you for a wonderful lunch. it was delicious.

1172
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:14,590
你怎么看垄断
What do you think of monopolies?

1173
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,160
你怎么看
You mean like the game?

1174
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:20,930
我觉得垄断不太好
No, I just think monopolies were made illegal in the country, frank,

1175
01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:23,260
那样就失去竞争了
Cause nobody wants to compete, you know.

1176
01:26:23,370 --> 01:26:26,360
没人愿意和一个垄断集团竞争
Nobody wants to compete, not with a monopoly.

1177
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:29,100
如果你让那些牛奶农场去竞争
I mean, you let the dairy farmers do that,

1178
01:26:29,210 --> 01:26:31,200
第二天肯定会有一半人已经破产了了
Half of them would be out of business tomorrow.

1179
01:26:31,340 --> 01:26:32,810
没办法  都是为了讨生活
Just trying to make a living.

1180
01:26:32,910 --> 01:26:34,610
那是你的权利  我是说
That's your right, I mean,

1181
01:26:34,810 --> 01:26:37,480
人人都有权利去选择怎么生活  这就是美国
It's everyone's right. it's America.

1182
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:42,020
我们只是不能太霸道了  得给别人留条活路
We just can't do it at the unreasonable expense of others.

1183
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:44,480
不然就会变得不美国了
Cause then it becomes un-American.

1184
01:26:44,590 --> 01:26:46,530
这就是为什么一加仑牛奶的价格
That's why the price we pay for that gallon of milk

1185
01:26:46,690 --> 01:26:48,460
总是不会和它的实际生产成本一样
Could never represent the true cost of production

1186
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:53,060
因为价格必须有人来制定和控制  这样才对大家都公平
Cause it's got to be controlled. it's gotta be set. it's gotta be fair.

1187
01:26:53,170 --> 01:26:55,660
有谁来控制?  我觉得自己定的价格就很公平
Gotta be controlled by who? I set a price that I think is fair.

1188
01:26:55,770 --> 01:26:57,070
-我不觉得那样公平  -你觉得不公平?
I don't think it's fair. you don't?

1189
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:58,640
-我不觉得那样公平  -可我觉得公平
I don't think it's fair. I think it's fair.

1190
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:00,710
我知道  消费者对你的货很满意
I mean, I know your customers are happy, frank,

1191
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:03,540
但他们不过是群瘾君子而已
Bunch of fucking junkies that they are.

1192
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:08,170
但你得也为那些挤奶工们想想  你为我们想过吗
But we fellow dairy farmers out here, frank, are you thinking of us?

1193
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,410
你为他们考虑过吗
You thinking of them?

1194
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:12,410
-挤奶工  -对
The dairy farmers? yeah.

1195
01:27:12,890 --> 01:27:17,650
多米尼克  他们也没为我着想过啊
I'm thinking of them, dominic, about as much as they've ever thought about me.

1196
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,090
行  先不扯这个了
I'm just thinking out loud now.

1197
01:27:20,590 --> 01:27:23,080
如果你把一部分货拿出来
If you took some of your inventory, frank,

1198
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,730
批发给其他人
And you sold it wholesale...

1199
01:27:26,930 --> 01:27:28,130
先坐
Sit.

1200
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,490
我们能合作  我们来分销
We could work. we could do some distribution.

1201
01:27:33,710 --> 01:27:34,940
我不知道怎么合作  我现在就做得挺好的
I don't know. I'm pretty good, dominic.

1202
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:38,980
我占有110街  155街  我足够了
You know, I got 110th, 155th, river to river. I'm all right.

1203
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:42,010
我是说我们一起把它做大
That's kind of a mom and pop store next to what I'm talking about.

1204
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:43,740
把它推向整个市场
I mean, let's go at least bigger than kmart.

1205
01:27:43,850 --> 01:27:48,750
洛杉矶  底特律  拉斯维加斯  把货推向全国市场
I'm talking about la, chicago, detroit, las vegas. let's go nationwide, huh?

1206
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:53,590
我绝对保证你的安全  那不正是你想要的吗
I'm gonna guarantee you your peace of mind here. you don't want that?

1207
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:56,640
你需要它
You're going to need it.

1208
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:58,910
我不知道你怎么看我
I don't know how you view me, you know.

1209
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:00,850
但我是个有修养的人  弗兰克
I'm kind of a renaissance man, frank.

1210
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:02,980
我每天打交道的那些人
You know, the people I deal with on a daily basis,

1211
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:04,920
甚至都不是文明人
You know, they're not enlightened, frank.

1212
01:28:05,020 --> 01:28:07,790
你跟他们说公民权如同对牛弹琴
You talk to them about civil rights, they don't know, you know.

1213
01:28:07,890 --> 01:28:08,920
而且他们不喜欢改变
They're not open to change.

1214
01:28:09,690 --> 01:28:13,190
总是按传统和老规矩办事  一直都是这样
Not from the way things are done and who's doing it.

1215
01:28:13,330 --> 01:28:16,660
但是如果我跟他们说一声就不会有什么误会
I talk to them, there's just no misunderstandings.

1216
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:21,030
这就是我能给你提供的安全
And that's what I mean by your peace of mind.

1217
01:28:25,710 --> 01:28:28,870
你现在进货价格是多少?  七万五  八万美金一公斤?
You're paying, what, $75,000, $80,000 a kilo?

1218
01:28:31,050 --> 01:28:33,180
我也是个有内涵的人
I'm a renaissance man, too.

1219
01:28:34,350 --> 01:28:35,980
你买的话我只要五万美金一公斤
I'll consider $50,000.

1220
01:28:44,930 --> 01:28:48,160
干嘛要跟这些人搅和  你看他们看你的眼神
Why would you trust these people? and the way they look at you...

1221
01:28:48,270 --> 01:28:50,630
他们看我就像圣诞节看见圣诞老人一样
They look at me like it's christmas and I'm santa claus.

1222
01:28:50,730 --> 01:28:53,400
我们是他们的救星
They look at us like we're the help.

1223
01:28:54,070 --> 01:28:55,900
现在他们得帮我干活了
They work for me now.

1224
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:03,210
我想当我和乔·弗雷泽对垒的时候
I predict that when I meet joe frazier,

1225
01:29:03,350 --> 01:29:07,650
会像是一个业余爱好手和真正的职业高手对决
This will be like a good amateur fighting a real professional.

1226
01:29:07,750 --> 01:29:10,220
他就象是个参加奥运会的毛头小伙儿
This will be like a kid out of the olympics...

1227
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:12,720
阿里不出三个回合就能把他打倒
Man 1: that's gonna be ali in like three.

1228
01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:15,090
和你对阵的不是奥斯卡·伯纳维纳
You're not fighting oscar bonavena,

1229
01:29:15,230 --> 01:29:16,320
也不是索尼·里斯顿
You're not fighting sonny liston.

1230
01:29:16,430 --> 01:29:17,450
你是在挑战乔·弗雷泽
You're fighting joe frazier.

1231
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:19,190
所有人都知道  那不是重点
Everybody knows that. that's not the point.

1232
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:20,630
他只是说说
He's all talk, man.

1233
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,990
好好瞧着阿里怎么蹂躏弗雷泽吧
Look at frazier! ali gonna crush him, baby.

1234
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:24,090
我会打败他的
I'll stop him.

1235
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,500
打败我?  就凭你?
Stop me? you?

1236
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:26,860
来吧  我等不急了
How soon? what round?

1237
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:30,500
不要让他逼你出战
Don't let him obligate you. one to 10!

1238
01:29:30,610 --> 01:29:35,440
今晚  1971年3月8日  让我们在麦迪逊广场花园
Tonight, march 8, 1971. here we are at madison square garden

1239
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:37,050
一起来见证这场世纪之战吧
For the fight of the century.

1240
01:29:37,150 --> 01:29:40,340
无论从任何角度来看  这场比赛都精彩异常
And by anybody's definition, this is a happening.

1241
01:29:40,450 --> 01:29:44,890
握手的场面当然会有  美女也会有
There are handshakes and, of course, there are utterly beautiful women.

1242
01:29:44,990 --> 01:29:47,150
但在握手和笑容的背后
But behind the smiles and behind the handshakes,

1243
01:29:47,260 --> 01:29:51,560
任何人都能感觉到一触即发的紧张气氛
You can feel the atmosphere is so heavy with tension, it's almost unbearable.

1244
01:29:52,330 --> 01:29:54,590
今天名角云集

And woody allen and diane keaton. the celebrities are pouring in.

1247

The way you all build it up, life magazine cover, time magazine,

1248
01:30:06,810 --> 01:30:10,800
每个人都有不同的见解  丹普斯说我会输的
Everybody gives their opinion. dempsey says I'll lose. joe louis...

1249
01:30:10,950 --> 01:30:14,310
乔·路易斯也说我会输  正是这样才坚定了我的信心
And when joe louis said I'm gonna lose, that's how I knew I'd won this one.

1250
01:30:14,450 --> 01:30:17,420
因为乔·路易斯的预测总是跟结果相反
Joe louis always picks the wrong man!

1251
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,610
他的预测永远都跟结果相反

1252

Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.

1255
01:30:33,170 --> 01:30:35,300
你要看比赛吗  鲍勃
You're not watching the fight, bob?

1256

我对拳击不感兴趣
I'm not into boxing.

1257
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:40,440
这可不是拳击

1258

这是政治
It's politics.

This guy, he's a supplier at most. or just a pimp.

01:35:32,070 --> 01:35:34,560
请你明白这是我一生中最重要的日子
Understand this is the most important day of my life, detective.

1320
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:36,190
我知道  我当然知道
Oh, I understand. I understand.

1321
01:35:36,310 --> 01:35:38,740
你知道吗  一个穿着价值五万美金大衣招摇过市的人
You know, a man who walks around in a $50,000 chinchilla coat

1322
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:41,070
却从来没请我甚至喝过一杯咖啡
And never even bought me a cup of coffee.

1323
01:35:41,210 --> 01:35:44,370
弗兰克  这就是你的不对了  你的账单都付了吗
There's something wrong there. pay your bills, frank?

1324
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:46,870
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

1325
01:35:46,980 --> 01:35:48,010
我问你  你的账单都付了吗
Do you pay your bills, I asked you?

1326
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:49,350
如果你没得到你的那份
If you're not getting your share,

1327
01:35:49,450 --> 01:35:50,820
也许你该跟你的上司去谈谈
Maybe you need to talk to the chief of police.

1328
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:54,190
我的那份?  你他妈根本都不知道我是谁
what's my share? cause you don't even fucking know me.

1329
01:35:55,090 --> 01:35:56,350
也许我是特例
Maybe I'm special.

1330
01:35:56,460 --> 01:35:58,290
没错  特例
You are special.

1331
01:35:58,430 --> 01:36:00,060
看见这个了吗
You see that right there?

1332

特别调查组
Special investigations unit.

1333
01:36:03,670 --> 01:36:04,930
很特别
Special.

1334
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:07,030

1337
01:36:12,910 --> 01:36:15,400
-你说完了吗  -恩  说完了
Are you done? oh, yeah, I'm done.

1338
01:36:18,410 --> 01:36:21,540
别忘了这个  好好度蜜月
Don't forget your card. have a nice fucking honeymoon.

1339
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:23,280
走
Let's go.

1340
01:37:22,580 --> 01:37:24,050
他的名字是弗兰克·卢卡斯

他给邦比·约翰逊做了十五年的司机  保镖  打手
For 15 years, he was bumpy johnson's driver, bodyguard and collector.

1344
01:37:38,830 --> 01:37:40,560
邦比死的时候就是他送葬的
He was with him when he died.

1345
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:45,530
他有五个兄弟  他是长兄  还有一堆表亲
He's got five brothers. he's the oldest. and a lot of cousins.

1346

The brothers are dexter,

1348

-住在布鲁克林区  是个干洗工  -有什么能帮忙的吗
In brooklyn. he's a dry cleaner. what can I do for you?

1349
01:37:55,410 --> 01:37:58,070
取衣服
I'm picking up. yeah.

1350
01:37:58,210 --> 01:38:00,240
梅尔文在皇后区开了一家家具店

1352
01:38:03,620 --> 01:38:04,750
-是这些吗  -没错
That's it right here? right there.

1353
01:38:04,890 --> 01:38:08,080
特伦斯在诺瓦克开了家五金店

1357
01:38:18,030 --> 01:38:19,590
少点吧  不然我换地方  怎么样
Oh, man, I'm gonna take it somewhere else, all right?

1358
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:22,830
这些店面都是毒品交易的配送中心
These businesses are the distribution and collection points

1359
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:25,500
同时也都是弗兰克名义上的收入来源
For frank's dope and frank's money.

1360
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:28,600
所有关于弗兰克的资料都让他看起来
Everything about frank's life seems

1361
01:38:28,750 --> 01:38:31,340
那么的谦逊  有规矩  守法
Unpretentious, orderly and legitimate.

1362
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:34,250
他每天都早上五点就起床
He starts early, gets up at 5:00 a.m.

1363
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:38,680
几乎每天都自己一个人在哈林区的一家餐馆吃早餐

Then he starts work. takes a meeting with the accountant or with his lawyer.

At nights, he usually stays at home. and if he does go out,

1366
01:38:46,830 --> 01:38:50,860
也仅和他的妻子或一些球员去固定的几家俱乐部
It's to one of two clubs or a handful of restaurants with his new wife.

1367
01:38:50,970 --> 01:38:52,800
那家伙不是他妈的张伯伦吗
Some ball players. that's fucking wilt chamberlain.

1368
01:38:52,940 --> 01:38:57,240
朋友都是社会名流  绝不和那些罪犯来往
Friends, musicians. never, never with organized crime guys.

1369
01:38:57,340 --> 01:39:00,100
星期日  他会带他母亲去教堂
Sundays, he takes his mother to church.

1370
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:02,130
然后他会去邦比的墓前献花
Then he drives out and he changes

1371
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:06,270
每个周日都是这样  风雨无阻
The flowers on bumpy's grave. every sunday, no matter what.

1372
01:39:07,150 --> 01:39:09,950
根本不像一般的毒贩子一样那么招摇
Not the typical day in the life of a dope man, richie.

1373
01:39:10,090 --> 01:39:11,140
恩
No.

1374
01:39:11,290 --> 01:39:15,090
不过邦比·约翰逊也很低调  尽管他纵横哈林区多年
Bumpy johnson's life wasn't typical either, and he ran harlem for years.

1375
01:39:15,220 --> 01:39:18,750
你的意思是说他接了邦比·约翰逊的班
So you're saying that frank lucas replaced bumpy johnson?

1376
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:20,260
-是的  -他的司机
Yeah. his driver?

1377
01:39:23,070 --> 01:39:25,590
但是...  但是好像...
But is it? is it? because everything he does...

1378
01:39:25,740 --> 01:39:27,430
他在分火鸡
He's handing out turkeys, man.

1379
01:39:27,570 --> 01:39:29,370
他的风格跟邦比却不太一样  对吗
He does the same as bumpy would have done, right?

1380
01:39:29,470 --> 01:39:32,570
想想谁是邦比最亲近的人呢
And who was bumpy most likely to teach?

1381
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:34,730
邦比每天都要见到他
The guy he sees every day.

1382
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:37,140
就像意大利的家族黑帮一样
It's like a sicilian family.

1383
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:41,340
他也用同样的组织结构来保护自己
He's structured his organization to protect him in the same way.

1384
01:39:41,450 --> 01:39:42,850
如果他跟了邦比很长时间
And if he was with bumpy for so long,

1385
01:39:42,950 --> 01:39:45,550
那就说明他和那些意大利人的来往肯定很密切
That means he would have spent a lot of time with italians.

1386
01:39:45,660 --> 01:39:48,450
密切到对他们的做法了如指掌
Definitely long enough to learn that much.

1387
01:39:48,590 --> 01:39:51,990
但是我觉得弗兰克后面
But here's the thing. I don't think it's frank lucas that we're after.

1388
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,490
还有更大的鱼
Who we want is whoever frank lucas is working for.

1389
01:39:57,130 --> 01:39:57,720
就是那个帮他毒品运进美国的家伙
It's whoever's actually bringing the heroin in.

1390
01:39:57,830 --> 01:40:00,830
好吧  你现在对他掌握多少了
Okay. so what do you have on him

1391
01:40:03,610 --> 01:40:04,400
有什么证据能扳倒他吗
That will stick in court? because this isn't it.

1392
01:40:05,870 --> 01:40:09,710
没有毒品  没有证人  就没人会被送进监狱的
Without powder, without informants, no one's going to jail.

1393
01:40:10,210 --> 01:40:11,370
我知道
That's understood, sir.

1394
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:14,880
除非我们非常非常幸运
And I don't think we're gonna get informants, not from inside the family,

1395
01:40:14,980 --> 01:40:17,750
否则我们不可能从他们家族内部突破
You know, unless we get very, very lucky.

1396
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:23,860
实验室分析表明
Straight up lab tests suggesting

1397
01:40:24,030 --> 01:40:26,360
蓝色魔法的纯度和亚洲货一致
Purity's consistent with asian dope.

1398
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:30,420
我们都知道  意大利人通常和欧洲人
The italians, we know, usually work with other europeans

1399
01:40:30,530 --> 01:40:32,470
或者土耳其人交易
Or with the turks.

1400
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:35,830
小包装蓝色魔法的踪迹遍及
We got small blue packets turning up

1401
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,560
整个三州交界区域的所有街区
In neighborhoods all over the tri-state area.

1402
01:40:39,010 --> 01:40:41,410
从唐人街到黑人区  再到华盛顿高地
From chinatown, to harlem, washington heights,

1403
01:40:41,510 --> 01:40:43,670
甚至里奇蒙德大街或者到斯代顿岛
Richmond avenue and staten island.

1404
01:40:43,780 --> 01:40:46,580
他们覆盖了北橘子郡  普林斯顿  贝永  诺瓦克
They got north orange, princeton, bayonne, newark,

1405
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:51,210
斯拉克斯  罗切斯特  水牛城这些地方
Syracuse, rochester, buffalo, and all the way through connecticut.

1406
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:53,220
都是一样的毒品
The same dope.

1407
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:57,890
火鸡来了
All right.

1408
01:41:02,410 --> 01:41:03,210
放那儿吧
That's it, down there.

1409
01:41:47,890 --> 01:41:50,090
来  手拉手祷告吧
Okay, let's all join hands.

1410
01:41:54,430 --> 01:41:57,130
主啊  感谢你赐予我们这些食物
Lord, we thank you for this food we're about to receive,

1411
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:59,170
使我们不至于饥饿
The nourishments of our bodies.

1412
01:41:59,270 --> 01:42:03,670
纯洁我们的灵魂  以耶稣的名义
Feed our souls with heavenly grace, in jesus' name and for his sake.

1413
01:42:04,140 --> 01:42:05,870
-阿门  -阿门
Amen. amen.

1414
01:42:26,330 --> 01:42:29,420
别怕  别怕  没事的
Hey, it's okay. it's okay. come on, now.

1415
01:42:30,940 --> 01:42:32,060
没事的
It's okay. shh.

1416
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:34,970
你准备好了吗  老家伙
You better get yourself ready, old man.

1417
01:42:35,070 --> 01:42:37,130
尽管放马过来吧
Come on, big man. throw the ball.

1418
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:39,610
准备好了  我要投了
Get yourself ready, old man. all right!

1419
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:42,740
你老爸说你有一只手很厉害
Come on, now. your pop said you had an arm on you. come on!

1420
01:42:42,850 --> 01:42:45,370
梅尔文叔叔  我要打的你满地找牙
I'm gonna set your ass in the grass, uncle melvin.

1421
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:48,040
你省口气吧  尽管放马过来
Hey! watch your mouth, boy. throw the ball!

1422
01:42:48,150 --> 01:42:50,990
梅尔文叔叔  我是个投手  不是外场手
Damn, uncle melvin, I'm a pitcher, not an outfielder!

1423
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:53,150
史蒂夫 过来
Steve. steve, come here.

1424
01:42:54,530 --> 01:42:55,550
过来  坐
Come, sit down.

1425
01:42:55,660 --> 01:42:57,750
有事吗  弗兰克叔叔
Uncle frank. what's happening?

1426
01:42:58,700 --> 01:43:00,060
你最近好吗
How you doing?

1427
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:01,150
不错啊
Cool.

1428
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:02,600
想喝点什么吗
You want a drink?

1429
01:43:02,700 --> 01:43:04,220
你最知道我不喝酒
You know better than that.

1430
01:43:04,340 --> 01:43:05,630
试试你
Just checking.

1431
01:43:08,170 --> 01:43:11,400
上次见面你去那儿了
Why didn't you show up for that meeting, steve?

1432
01:43:12,180 --> 01:43:15,270
我和那些扬基俱乐部的人还有比利·马丁都说好了
I set it up with the yankees and billy martin.

1433
01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:19,150
你为什么没来
Why didn't you show up?

1434
01:43:21,550 --> 01:43:23,180
别骗我
Don't lie to me.

1435
01:43:23,790 --> 01:43:26,280
我不想再打球了
I don't want to play ball no more.

1436
01:43:26,860 --> 01:43:27,950
-我想好了  -你说什么
I decided. what you talking about?

1437
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:29,920
你想好了?  想好什么了
You decided? decided what?

1438
01:43:30,290 --> 01:43:31,350
这不是我想要的
That ain't what I want.

1439
01:43:31,460 --> 01:43:33,860
你胡说些什么?  你从小屁孩就开始打球
What you talking about? you've been playing since you was a little boy.

1440
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,330
都可以进入职业队了  你怎么...
You were ready to go into the pros. what you...

1441
01:43:35,470 --> 01:43:37,760
弗兰克!  有点麻烦
Frank! we got a problem, man.

1442
01:43:41,140 --> 01:43:42,800
你到底想怎么样
What do you want?

1443
01:43:44,310 --> 01:43:46,800
我想像你一样
I want what you got, uncle frank.

1444
01:43:46,910 --> 01:43:48,610
我想像你一样
I want to be you.

1445
01:44:08,220 --> 01:44:09,880
稀释的太厉害了
He's been diluting it so much.

1446
01:44:09,980 --> 01:44:11,650
比以往纯度少了两三个百分点
We're down 2%%, 3%% pure.

1447
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:14,240
你亲自试过了?
And you tested it? you're sure?

1448
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:15,320
是的
Yeah.

1449
01:44:20,430 --> 01:44:21,420
你看什么看
Fuck you looking at?

1450
01:45:14,070 --> 01:45:15,260
伙计
My man.

1451
01:45:15,770 --> 01:45:17,630
欢迎啊  弗兰克
Welcome, frank. how you doing, nick?

1452
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:22,150
-你好吗  尼克  -事事顺心  欢迎啊
How you doing, nick? it's all great. welcome.

1453
01:45:22,390 --> 01:45:24,420
-我想跟你谈谈  -好啊  来吧
I need to talk to you. great. come on.

1454
01:45:24,530 --> 01:45:26,790
嘿  你们都给我出去
Hey, you all, everybody get out! let's go.

1455
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:27,990
快点  快点
Come on! hurry up!

1456
01:45:30,770 --> 01:45:33,130
坐  兄弟
Sit, my brother.

1457
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:36,800
我听说你跟查理聊过了
I take it you talked to charlie.

1458
01:45:37,970 --> 01:45:40,370
我想你肯定想多知道点我的新玩法
Guess you wanna hear more about my black coalition.

1459
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:42,000
-我演示给你看  -不  不  不
Let me explain to you... no, no, no.

1460
01:45:42,110 --> 01:45:43,510
行了  行了
I'm all right.

1461
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:45,040
尼克  我可不是为那个来找你的
That's not what I came here for, nick.

1462
01:45:46,410 --> 01:45:47,880
大家都很满意
Yeah, everybody's good, nick.

1463
01:45:47,980 --> 01:45:51,010
我知道大家都很满意  查理  巴兹  还有意大利人
You know, everybody's happy. charlie, baz, the italians,

1464
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:53,180
除了你之外大家都很满意
You know, johnny law. everybody's happy except you.

1465
01:45:53,290 --> 01:45:54,480
我很满意啊  弗兰克
I'm happy, frank.

1466
01:45:54,660 --> 01:45:55,850
你满意吗?  真的吗？
You happy? really?

1467
01:45:55,960 --> 01:45:57,580
也许我会让你不满意的
Well, maybe I'm the one with the problem.

1468
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,420
继续  继续
Yeah, go on. get one.

1469
01:45:59,530 --> 01:46:00,590
好吧
All right.

1470
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:01,950
我只是不明白
I gotta problem 'cause

1471
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:04,220
为什么你非得要
I don't understand why you gotta take

1472
01:46:04,330 --> 01:46:06,430
把我的好货搞成那样
Something that's perfectly good

1473
01:46:06,530 --> 01:46:08,230
砸我的招牌
And mess it up.

1474
01:46:08,470 --> 01:46:09,600
看见了吗  这可是个品牌
See, brand names.

1475
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:10,800
品牌很重要  知道吗
Brand names mean something. understand?

1476
01:46:12,070 --> 01:46:13,730
别他妈吵了
Shut the fuck up!

1477
01:46:14,710 --> 01:46:16,270
继续  弗兰克
Go ahead, frank.

1478
01:46:16,380 --> 01:46:17,840
太吵了  不好意思
I'm sorry about that bullshit.

1479
01:46:17,980 --> 01:46:19,340
蓝色魔法
Blue magic.

1480
01:46:20,010 --> 01:46:21,640
那就是品牌
That's a brand name.

1481
01:46:21,820 --> 01:46:23,510
就像是百事可乐一样  那是个品牌
Like pepsi, that's a brand name.

1482
01:46:23,650 --> 01:46:26,350
我让他保质  并且保量
I stand behind it. I guarantee it.

1483
01:46:26,490 --> 01:46:28,610
即使他们根本都不认识我
They know that, even if they don't know me any more than

1484
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:31,280
他们也会认这个牌子
They know the chairman of general mills.

1485
01:46:31,390 --> 01:46:32,690
你都说些什么啊  弗兰克
What the fuck are you talking about, frank?

1486
01:46:32,790 --> 01:46:35,630
我在说你把我的蓝色魔法
What I'm talking about is when you chop my dope down

1487
01:46:35,730 --> 01:46:37,960
一分为二 为三  为四
To one, two, three, four, five percent

1488
01:46:38,130 --> 01:46:40,400
然后你还继续叫他蓝色魔法
And then you call it blue magic,

1489
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:41,990
那你就是在砸我的招牌  是侵权
That is trademark infringement.

1490
01:46:42,170 --> 01:46:43,660
你明白我说什么吗
You understand what I'm saying?

1491
01:46:43,770 --> 01:46:46,260
弗兰克  我买了货  我有权利决定怎么卖它
With all due respect, frank, if I buy something, I own it.

1492
01:46:46,370 --> 01:46:47,640
不是这么回事
No, that ain't true. that ain't true.

1493
01:46:47,740 --> 01:46:49,970
我买辆车  我想怎么弄就能怎么弄  那是我的自由
If I buy a car, and I wanna paint it, I can paint the motherfucker.

1494
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:51,200
我知道  但是你没必要这么做了
Yeah, but you don't have to.

1495
01:46:51,310 --> 01:46:52,800
这就是我说的  你没必要这么做
This is what I'm saying to you, nick, you don't have to.

1496
01:46:52,910 --> 01:46:54,350
利润已经够高了
Good enough the way it is.

1497
01:46:54,450 --> 01:46:55,850
只要保证蓝色魔法的招牌
You can make enough money off it

1498
01:46:55,950 --> 01:46:57,250
就能让你财源不断
The way it is, just by calling it blue magic.

1499
01:46:57,350 --> 01:46:59,180
要是你还想要更多  就有点过了
Anything more than that is greed, son.

1500
01:46:59,290 --> 01:47:01,190
那你想让我怎么办  弗兰克  改品牌吗
What you want, frank? you want me to change the name on it?

1501
01:47:01,290 --> 01:47:03,280
我坚持你最好改个名字
I would have to insist that you change the name.

1502
01:47:03,390 --> 01:47:05,290
那好吧  那我就叫他红色魔法好了
Fine by me, frank. I'll call it red magic,

1503
01:47:05,390 --> 01:47:07,260
尽管听起来不那么顺口
Even though that don't sound as good.

1504
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:08,760
我不管你叫什么
I don't give a fuck what you call it.

1505
01:47:08,860 --> 01:47:10,230
只要不砸了我招牌
Put a chokehold on the motherfucker

1506
01:47:10,330 --> 01:47:12,960
你叫他蓝色狗屎我都不管  你明白我的意思吗
And call it blue dog shit, you know what I mean?

1507
01:47:13,070 --> 01:47:17,300
你要再让我抓住那么做
I don't care, just don't let me catch you doing this again.

1508
01:47:17,410 --> 01:47:20,070
抓住我?  侵权?  坚持?
Catch me? infringement? insist?

1509
01:47:20,170 --> 01:47:21,970
我可不喜欢那些文绉绉的词
I don't like these words as much as,

1510
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:24,810
不好意思打扰你了  尼克
"please, thank you, I'm sorry to bother you, nicky."

1511
01:47:24,910 --> 01:47:27,040
你不请自来  在我的地盘应该恭敬一点才对
These are better words you use to come to my motherfucking club

1512
01:47:27,150 --> 01:47:29,710
你明白吗
Without an invitation! you hear me?

1513
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:31,950
伙计
My man.

1514
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:44,760
妈的  后面是警察吗
Oh, shit. fuck, is that the cops there, man?

1515
01:47:52,820 --> 01:47:54,420
没事
It's all right.

1516
01:47:55,530 --> 01:47:58,020
他们想干嘛  给我们开罚单吗
The hell they're gonna do, give us a ticket?

1517
01:47:58,530 --> 01:48:00,790
弗兰克  车里有货啊
Stuff's in the car, frank.

1518
01:48:02,700 --> 01:48:03,690
什么?
What?

1519
01:48:03,830 --> 01:48:05,960
车里有些货
Some of it's in the trunk.

1520
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:09,430
-你过得好吗  弗兰克?  -我很好  你怎么样  侦探?
How you doing, frank? I'm good. how you doing, detective?

1521
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:11,030
感恩节过得如何?
How was your thanksgiving?

1522
01:48:11,170 --> 01:48:13,440
不好  你怎么不下车?
Not so good, as a matter of fact. why don't you get out of the car?

1523
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:20,140
爽快点  他妈的把钥匙给我
Come on, give me the fucking keys.

1524
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:22,120
谢尔比哪去了?  离职啦?
Where's the shelby at? the shelby's gone?

1525
01:48:22,220 --> 01:48:23,980
谢尔比不在啦  弗兰克  站那儿别动
The shelby's gone, frank. stay right there.

1526
01:48:24,090 --> 01:48:25,990
没问题
Yes, sir. right here.

1527
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:28,650
看看你有什么好东西?
You got anything worth looking at in here?

1528
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:30,490
那家伙是特鲁普
Hey, that's that trupo guy.

1529
01:48:30,590 --> 01:48:32,190
-真的?  -对
Is that him? yeah.

1530
01:48:32,330 --> 01:48:33,820
败类!
Fucking prick.

1531
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,400
-弗兰克  过来一下  -好
Come over here a minute, frank. yeah.

1532
01:48:41,670 --> 01:48:42,730
我们应该怎么办?
What are we gonna do about this?

1533
01:48:42,870 --> 01:48:45,240
什么也不要做  把它塞进车里  关上后备箱
We don't do shit about it. we close it up, throw it back in the trunk,

1534
01:48:45,380 --> 01:48:47,970
大家都回家去吃点南瓜饼  喝点苹果酒
Everybody go home, have some pumpkin pie, warm apple cider.

1535
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:49,880
我有一个更好的主意
I got a better idea.

1536
01:48:51,050 --> 01:48:54,380
不如我把你们俩扔进河里?
Or would you rather me throw you and your brother in the fucking river?

1537
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:57,180
或者下次我们炸了你的家!
Would you rather your house blows up next time?

1538
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:03,890
-我很喜欢那辆车  -了解
I loved that car. I know.

1539
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:10,420
他在干什么? 摇下车窗!
What's he doing? shakedown!

1540
01:49:11,130 --> 01:49:13,260
看来有人要顺手牵羊了
Somebody's getting some money for the benevolent fund.

1541
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:14,390
真是人渣
Look at that shit.

1542
01:49:15,110 --> 01:49:16,400
对不起 弗兰克
Sorry, frank.

1543
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:18,770
没关系  先上车
It's all right. go and get in the car.

1544
01:49:42,170 --> 01:49:44,930
好的  给我回电话
All right, you call me back.

1545
01:49:47,060 --> 01:49:49,110
国安局  税局  联邦调查局
Ins, irs, FBI.

1546
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:50,950
我从他们那里得不到任何有用的资料
I can't get a damn thing out of any of them.

1547
01:49:51,030 --> 01:49:52,390
因为他们认为你和黑帮是一伙儿的
Because they all think you're on the take.

1548
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:55,220
而你却认为他们才是蛇鼠一窝
And you think they are.

1549
01:49:55,330 --> 01:49:58,260
你知道  我觉得他们并不想完全禁绝贩毒
You know, I don't think they want this to stop.

1550
01:49:58,370 --> 01:49:59,960
有太多的人从中受益
I think it employs too many people.

1551
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:03,830
法官  律师  警察  政治家
Judges, lawyers, cops, politicians,

1552
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,970
狱警  假释官
Prison guards, probation officers.

1553
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:08,640
如果他们停止贩毒
They stop bringing dope into this country,

1554
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:11,440
会有十万人没了饭碗
About 100,000 people are going to be out of a job.

1555
01:50:14,820 --> 01:50:17,780
找头儿的
Spearman.

1556
01:50:17,890 --> 01:50:21,250
我们是联邦调查局的  来找罗伯特警官
FBI. here to see detective roberts.

1557
01:50:25,890 --> 01:50:29,560
谁泄漏出来的?  我认识的人吗?  我妻子?
So who took it out? somebody I know? my wife?

1558
01:50:30,930 --> 01:50:32,590
如果有人悬赏要我的命
Come on, if somebody's taking a contract

1559
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:34,330
我应该知道的
Out on my life, I'd like to know.

1560
01:50:34,440 --> 01:50:38,030
我不能泄露  你能理解吗?
I can't say without compromising our source. you understand?

1561
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:40,540
不  这和和我的生命有关
No. not when it's my life, I don't understand.

1562
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:42,130
如果你想要  我们可以派人来保护你
If you want we can assign someone to you.

1563
01:50:42,310 --> 01:50:43,870
联邦调查局的保护
FBI protection.

1564
01:50:44,780 --> 01:50:48,180
你知道吗? 我的生命本来就已经够危险了
You know what? my life is dangerous enough as it is.

1565
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:51,350
那我们就不再浪费你们的时间了  继续你的工作吧
Well, we'll let you get back to your business.

1566
01:50:51,450 --> 01:50:53,550
好吧  拉里  鲍勃
Okay. larry, bob.

1567
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:55,880
欢迎来到"花园之州"
Thanks for visiting the garden state.

1568
01:50:55,990 --> 01:50:57,120
小心点
Take care.

1569
01:50:57,220 --> 01:50:59,560
喂  你知道弗兰克·卢卡斯吗?
Hey, what do you know about frank lucas?

1570
01:50:59,660 --> 01:51:03,060
我们知道你总在打听他
We know that you keep calling about him.

1571
01:51:12,770 --> 01:51:17,270
我们相信和平就要到来
We believe that peace is at hand.

1572
01:51:19,350 --> 01:51:23,780
很快就可以达成协议了
We believe that an agreement is within sight.

1573
01:51:26,550 --> 01:51:29,720
像我以前说过的...
As I said earlier...

1574
01:51:34,230 --> 01:51:35,200
对
Yeah.

1575
01:51:36,430 --> 01:51:38,360
喂  乔伊
Hey, joey. hi.

1576

1597

不要去骚扰那个大人物?

You've been served. I'm sorry.

1620
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:42,710
好吧
All right.

1621
01:55:46,730 --> 01:55:47,720
罗莉

1622
01:55:49,870 --> 01:55:53,560
对不起  我没有给你想要的那种生活
Look, I'm sorry I never gave you the kind of life you wanted, all right.

1623
01:55:53,700 --> 01:55:56,000
很抱歉以前做的不够
I'm sorry it was never enough.

1624
01:55:59,110 --> 01:56:01,740
但是不要因为我诚实而惩罚我
Don't punish me for being honest.

1625
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:03,850
不要夺走我的孩子
Don't take my boy away.

1626
01:56:06,220 --> 01:56:09,550
你说什么?  你觉得我是因为你诚实?
What are you saying? that because you were honest

1627
01:56:09,690 --> 01:56:12,850
你不像其他警察那样捞黑钱我才离开你?
And you didn't take money like every other cop, I left you?

1628
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:15,480
你不捞黑钱只有一个原因
No, you don't take money for one reason.

1629
01:56:15,590 --> 01:56:18,390
只是为了博取诚实的名声来掩盖别的东西
To buy being dishonest about everything else.

1630
01:56:18,900 --> 01:56:20,890
那比捞黑钱更让人恶心
And that's worse than taking money nobody gives a shit about.

1631
01:56:21,030 --> 01:56:24,000
卖毒品的钱和赌博的钱  谁不想要?
Drug money, gambling money nobody's gonna miss.

1632
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:27,860
我宁可你拿那些钱  也要你对我诚实
You know, I'd rather you took it and been honest with me.

1633
01:56:27,970 --> 01:56:30,670
或者不拿  我也不在乎  但是不要欺骗我
Or don't take it. I don't care. but then don't go cheat on me.

1634
01:56:30,770 --> 01:56:33,870
不要欺骗孩子  不要总在外面鬼混而没时间陪他
Don't cheat on your kid by never being around. don't go out and get laid

1635
01:56:33,980 --> 01:56:36,910
不要和你的那些红颜知己婊子们睡觉
By your snitches and your secretaries and strippers!

1636
01:56:37,050 --> 01:56:39,780
我一眼就能看出来  她就是其中一个
I can tell by just looking, she's one of them.

1637
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:40,910
你...
You...

1638
01:56:41,220 --> 01:56:45,520
你以为你诚实就可以上天堂  你绝对上不了天堂
You think you're going to heaven because you're honest, but you're not.

1639
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:48,520
你将和你所不屑的那些警察们一起去地狱
You're going to the same hell as the crooked cops you can't stand.

1640
01:56:49,790 --> 01:56:51,350
起立
All rise.

1641

Please be seated.

1642
01:56:58,940 --> 01:57:00,630
迪肯森小姐
Miss dickerson,

1643
01:57:00,770 --> 01:57:03,260
在法庭宣判前
Before the court renders its opinion,

1644
01:57:03,410 --> 01:57:06,070
你还有什么要说的?
Is there anything else you'd like to be heard on?

1645
01:57:06,180 --> 01:57:07,900
是的  法官
Yes, your honor.

1646

Mr. roberts' environment is for a child. how dangerous it is.

1648
01:57:15,350 --> 01:57:19,120
但是他是负责来保护我们的  我们给了他这样的责任
We tell him to protect us. we give him that responsibility,

1649
01:57:19,260 --> 01:57:21,780
然后我们却说  我们不相信他可以养好小孩
But then say, "oh, we don't trust you to raise a child.

1650
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:23,450
我们认为你并不适合
"we don't think you're fit for that."

1651
01:57:23,560 --> 01:57:25,150
我是不适合
I'm not.

1652
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:27,430
你说的对
You're right.

1653
01:57:28,630 --> 01:57:31,070
我没有足够的条件养育孩子
Being around me is no place for a kid.

1654
01:57:31,170 --> 01:57:34,400
你把他带到维加斯去吧  我有空就去看他
You take him to vegas. I'll come see him when I can.

1655
01:57:37,340 --> 01:57:40,970
法官  很抱歉浪费了法庭的时间

按潜规则办事  这是一回事

1668
01:58:43,310 --> 01:58:44,900
这本来不是什么问题

1669
01:58:45,010 --> 01:58:47,700
我十岁起就一直在给警察钱
I've been paying off the police since I was 10 years old.

1670
01:58:47,810 --> 01:58:50,470
把他们的孩子送到大学  获得国家荣誉奖章
Put more of their kids through college than the national merit award.

1671
01:58:50,610 --> 01:58:52,380

这次有点不同...

他们是专门调查组的  这完全是他们自己的问题
Special investigative unit. that's their problem. they think they're special.

好
Good.

1678
01:59:06,600 --> 01:59:08,650
我担心的并不只有警察
The police, that ain't the only somebody I'm worried about.

1694
01:59:49,960 --> 01:59:52,010
但实际上  他哪也不能去
But no, he couldn't go nowhere.

1695
01:59:52,120 --> 01:59:53,590
哪都不安全

1701
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:05,160
也许再也不能和我家人

1702

这里一起过圣诞了

1703
02:00:07,170 --> 02:00:10,300
你给他们钱不就完了吗?

1707
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:17,570
我付的比他们应得的多

1708
02:00:17,680 --> 02:00:19,840
但他们从来不知足!
I can't satisfy nobody!

1709
02:00:19,950 --> 02:00:22,010
就像吸毒一样! 每个人都很歇斯底里!
It's like dope! everybody's strung out!

1710
02:00:22,120 --> 02:00:24,150
你给的越多  他们就要的越多
The more you give 'em, the more they want.

1711
02:00:24,290 --> 02:00:26,590
他们总是想多要点
They expect more.

1712
02:00:27,590 --> 02:00:29,790
弄成恶性循环了
Give more and they want more.

1713
02:00:34,500 --> 02:00:36,590
你想出去吗?
Do you want to go out?

1714
02:00:37,540 --> 02:00:39,500
好的  穿上衣服
All right, baby. put something of what you got.

1715

Should i? yeah.

1716
02:00:40,910 --> 02:00:42,100
这是圣诞精神
That's christmas spirit.

1717
02:00:42,210 --> 02:00:44,440
这就对了嘛
That's what I'm talking about. feliz navidad.

1718
02:00:44,540 --> 02:00:46,270
穿漂亮点儿
Something nice? mmm-hmm.

1719
02:00:54,020 --> 02:00:55,350
我们将会过得很愉快
We're going to have a great time.

1720
02:00:55,450 --> 02:00:56,550
对  淇塔

卢卡斯  祝您愉快

1723
02:01:06,180 --> 02:01:06,910
尼克

我看见了  继续开
Yeah, I see him. let's keep going.

1727
02:01:13,350 --> 02:01:14,410
要转回来吗?
Around back?

1728
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:17,620
不要  我不会偷偷溜进我自己的俱乐部
Hell, no. I ain't sneaking into my own club.

1729
02:01:18,030 --> 02:01:19,960
难以置信
Incredible. huh?

1730
02:01:42,220 --> 02:01:43,620

1733
02:01:57,130 --> 02:01:58,930
我想在车里等
I want to wait in the car.

1734
02:01:59,030 --> 02:02:02,090
弗兰克  让我去弄就行了
Frank, I got it. I got it. I'll wait for it. I got it.

1735
02:02:02,500 --> 02:02:04,530
要那种黄色的酱  黄色的
Get that yellow sauce. yellow sauce.

1736
02:02:04,670 --> 02:02:06,700
还有鸡  宫爆鸡丁
And the chicken. the kung pao chicken.

1737
02:02:12,980 --> 02:02:14,710
把暖气打开好吗?
Can you turn the heater on?

1738
02:02:21,060 --> 02:02:23,220
该死  我去拿钥匙
Shit. I'm gonna go get the keys.

1739
02:02:37,170 --> 02:02:39,700
-德克  把钥匙给我  -给你

1740
02:02:45,450 --> 02:02:46,710
德克!
Doc!

1741
02:02:50,850 --> 02:02:52,650
快下车
Get out of the car.

1742
02:02:59,090 --> 02:03:01,030
-你还好吗? -没事
You okay? yeah.

1743
02:03:01,130 --> 02:03:02,190
该死的
Shit.

1744
02:03:03,530 --> 02:03:05,560
你怎么样?
Come on, baby. you all right?

1745
02:03:06,530 --> 02:03:07,830
我们走
Let's go.

1746
02:03:28,490 --> 02:03:29,960
是尼克干的?
Was it nicky?

1747
02:03:31,630 --> 02:03:33,960
不管是不是他干的  我们马上去杀了他
We'll go right now and fucking kill him whether it was him or not,

1748
02:03:34,100 --> 02:03:36,030
只要你下一个命令  弗兰克
You say the word, frankie.

1749
02:03:37,570 --> 02:03:39,900
我们得有所行动
We got to do something, frank.

1750
02:03:40,330 --> 02:03:41,360
不能光坐在这里
We can't just sit here.

1751
02:03:41,470 --> 02:03:42,960
我们要走了
We're leaving.

1752
02:03:46,110 --> 02:03:47,770
大家都回去吧
All right, everybody get out. you all right, man?

1753
02:03:47,910 --> 02:03:50,040
今天是圣诞节  去和家人待在一块
Go on home. it's christmas time. go and be with your families.

1754
02:03:50,140 --> 02:03:51,440
我很好
I'm all right.

1755
02:03:51,580 --> 02:03:54,480
走呀  去陪你们的孩子
Go on. go ahead. be with your kids.

1756
02:03:54,620 --> 02:03:55,910
走吧
Go ahead.

1757
02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:09,150
你要去哪里?
Where are we gonna go, huh?

1758
02:04:09,300 --> 02:04:10,890
我们去西班牙  或者  中国?
We're gonna go to spain, somewhere? china?

1759
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:14,490
别闹了  坐下  说说你想去哪
Huh? come on, sit down. tell me where you want to go.

1760
02:04:15,170 --> 02:04:18,100
弗兰克  我们哪都可以去
Frank, we can go anywhere we want.

1761
02:04:18,210 --> 02:04:20,110
-不行  -我们在哪生活都行  弗兰克
No, we can't. we can live anywhere, frank.

1762
02:04:20,210 --> 02:04:21,900
去哪里? 然后呢? 逃跑? 躲藏?
Where? and do what? run? hide?

1763
02:04:22,010 --> 02:04:24,940
弗兰克·卢卡斯不会怕任何人
Frank lucas don't run from nobody, baby.

1764
02:04:25,050 --> 02:04:26,840
我们哪里也不去  就在这里待着
We ain't going nowhere. we're gonna stay right here.

1765
02:04:26,980 --> 02:04:29,250
这是我的家
We're gonna stay right here. this is my home.

1766
02:04:29,350 --> 02:04:32,650
我的生意  我的妻子  母亲和家庭都在这里
This is where my business is, my wife, my mother, my family.

1767
02:04:32,790 --> 02:04:35,260
这是我的国家  我哪也不去
My country. I ain't going nowhere.

1768
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:38,150
我不会因为怕任何人而逃离
I ain't running from nobody!

1769
02:04:39,530 --> 02:04:41,150
这是美国
This is America.

1770
02:04:47,970 --> 02:04:50,530
你也得留在这里!
And you ain't going nowhere, either!

1771
02:04:52,570 --> 02:04:53,700
啊?
Huh?

1772
02:04:56,010 --> 02:04:58,670
华盛顿时间27日7点
A ceasefire, internationally supervised, will begin

1773
02:04:58,810 --> 02:05:03,110
停火协议将会生效
At 7:00 p.m. this saturday, january 27th, washington time.

1774
02:05:03,220 --> 02:05:05,240
我一会给你打电话
I'll call you back.

1775
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:07,750
喂! 你在做什么?
Hey! what are you doing?

1776
02:05:09,960 --> 02:05:11,150
瑞奇
Richie.

1777
02:05:18,370 --> 02:05:23,170
我听说科西嘉黑帮朝弗兰克开了一枪
So, what I hear it was the corsican mob took a shot at frank.

1778
02:05:23,300 --> 02:05:25,140
是法国贩毒集团在美国的人干的 菲尔南多·雷
You know, french connection, fernando rey,

1779
02:05:25,240 --> 02:05:27,610
一个被弗兰克挤出了市场的毒贩
The exporters that frank has put out of business.

1780
02:05:29,010 --> 02:05:31,140
在纽约我可以搞定
Look, I can take care of him in new york.

1781
02:05:31,250 --> 02:05:32,710
但是我不想总是担心
I just don't want to have to worry that every time

1782
02:05:32,850 --> 02:05:34,310
每次他开车过桥去泽西的时候
He drives across the bridge to jersey,

1783
02:05:34,420 --> 02:05:37,210
可能会被人暗杀
Someone's gonna take another shot at him.

1784
02:05:37,350 --> 02:05:40,620
瑞奇  我们得一起合作
Richie, you and I gotta start working together.

1785
02:05:41,090 --> 02:05:43,450
我们需要更加努力
We need to step up our efforts.

1786
02:05:43,820 --> 02:05:46,490
下次他们的枪法会更准
Next time, their aim could be better.

1787
02:05:47,090 --> 02:05:49,690
我们得让这头肥牛活着
We need to keep this cash cow alive.

1788
02:05:55,540 --> 02:05:57,730
看看你在做什么?
What the fuck are you doing here?

1789
02:06:02,780 --> 02:06:06,710
你要捉弗兰克·卢卡斯?  你哪儿出毛病啦?
Were you actually gonna arrest frank lucas? what's the matter with you?

1790
02:06:07,110 --> 02:06:09,310
-你不知道吗?  -不知道
What, you don't know? no.

1791
02:06:10,020 --> 02:06:12,540
新泽西的每个人都是疯子
Everybody in new jersey's crazy. oh.

1792
02:06:13,090 --> 02:06:16,520
你知道我们是干什么的  警察就是抓坏人的
You know what we do here? cops arrest bad guys.

1793
02:06:18,760 --> 02:06:20,750
在你上桥之前
Before you get on that bridge again,

1794
02:06:20,900 --> 02:06:24,260
先给我打电话  确保那里是安全的
You should call me first, just make sure it's safe.

1795
02:06:27,470 --> 02:06:31,060
我比我的朋友们更聪明  我可以保证你的安全
"i'm more enlightened than some of my friends. I can guarantee you peace of mind."

1796
02:06:31,210 --> 02:06:33,500
这是你讲过的  多米尼克
That's what you told me, dominic.

1797
02:06:34,780 --> 02:06:37,340
我可以保证你的安全
"i can guarantee you peace of mind!"

1798
02:06:37,450 --> 02:06:39,500
我现在一点也不安全
I don't feel so peaceful!

1799
02:06:44,550 --> 02:06:46,750
我妻子差点被杀了!
They tried to kill my wife!

1800
02:06:51,160 --> 02:06:52,720
他们是谁?
Who was that? huh?

1801
02:06:54,930 --> 02:06:57,300
也许是你们的人
Maybe it was one of your peoples.

1802
02:06:57,430 --> 02:06:59,630
-我不知道  -你不知道?  -不知道
I don't know yet. no. you don't know?

1803
02:06:59,770 --> 02:07:01,290
你不知道
You don't know.

1804
02:07:02,670 --> 02:07:05,610
我知道的我会告诉你  我也许应该
I'll tell you what I know. maybe I should just put 500 guns

1805
02:07:05,740 --> 02:07:07,800
在街上放500个枪手开始杀些人
Out there on the street and just start shooting up some people,

1806
02:07:07,910 --> 02:07:08,900
这样才能有点作用
Just to make a point.

1807
02:07:09,010 --> 02:07:12,310
弗兰克  刺杀你的可能是瘾君子  可能是竞争对手
Frank, it was a junkie. it was a rival. some dumb-ass kid

1808
02:07:12,450 --> 02:07:16,140
也可能是个想出名的小子 或是某个你忘了打点的人
Trying to make a name for himself. somebody you forgot to pay off.

1809
02:07:16,280 --> 02:07:19,220
也许你得罪了某人但你不知道
Someone you slighted without even realizing it.

1810
02:07:19,320 --> 02:07:23,590
也许是你被排挤得没了活路的的竞争对手
Could be someone you put out of business from being so successful. look at you.

1811
02:07:24,430 --> 02:07:27,990
你的成功给你招来了不少敌人
Success, it's got enemies, frank. lots of enemies.

1812
02:07:29,630 --> 02:07:32,160
是成功害了你  你能怎么做?
So your success took a shot at you. what are you gonna do now?

1813
02:07:32,300 --> 02:07:35,960
你能怎么办?  退出江湖?
How you gonna kill it? you're gonna become unsuccessful?

1814
02:07:36,940 --> 02:07:39,770
弗兰克  如果我们想成功  就一定会树敌的
Frank, we can be successful and have enemies, right?

1815
02:07:40,170 --> 02:07:43,440
除非我们不想成功  你知道  我们也结交了一些朋友
Or we can be unsuccessful, too, you know, we can have friends.

1816
02:07:44,350 --> 02:07:46,440
我们只能这样做
That's the choice we make.

1817
02:07:47,850 --> 02:07:51,480
北越的军队已经打到了西贡
The final evacuation of military and diplomatic personnel

1818
02:07:51,620 --> 02:07:55,990
我们正在彻夜疏散军事和外交人员
Continued throughout the night, as north vietnamese troops marched on saigon.

1819
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:59,330
西贡的陷落迫在眉睫
The imminent fall of the city has brought

1820
02:07:59,330 --> 02:08:01,450
人们日渐绝望
chaos and a growing sense of desperation.

1821
02:08:10,470 --> 02:08:13,870
国际长途
International.

1822
02:08:14,010 --> 02:08:15,530
请稍等
One moment, please.

1823
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:25,280

1826
02:08:28,660 --> 02:08:29,850
全完了
It's all over.

1827
02:08:29,990 --> 02:08:31,820
我看到新闻了  那边到底怎么样了?
Yeah, I'm watching the news. what the hell's going on?

1828
02:08:31,930 --> 02:08:33,620
结束了  弗兰克
The game's over, frank.

1829
02:08:33,730 --> 02:08:35,060
唔  结束了
Huh? it's done.

1830
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:37,160
大家都要回家了  和平要到来了
Everybody going home, baby. give peace a chance.

1831
02:08:37,260 --> 02:08:38,630
听我说 这事没完...
Well, look, I'm not... listen to me.

I want 2,000 keys in the air.

1834
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:47,470
不可能  我们的资源都撤走了  没法再做了
It's impossible, frank. all our resources are going home. it's over.

1835
02:08:47,580 --> 02:08:49,340
我要过去  我来教你做
I'll tell you what. I'm on my way over there.

1836
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:51,380
-现在? 别开玩笑了  -没错
Right now? oh, come... yeah.

1837
02:08:58,750 --> 02:09:00,910
你敢偷我东西?
You stole my shit?

1838
02:09:01,060 --> 02:09:03,150
-斯比尔曼  快醒醒  -怎么啦?
Spearman, wake the fuck up, man. what?

1839
02:09:05,090 --> 02:09:06,650
我的货哪去了  亲爱的?
Where's my shit, darlynn?

1840

Don't hurt me, jimmy!

1841
02:09:10,360 --> 02:09:12,200
天啊! ...警察! 警察!
Jesus! what the... police! police!

1842
02:09:12,300 --> 02:09:14,100
把枪放下  吉米! 把枪放下!
Drop the gun, jimmy! drop the gun!

1843
02:09:14,230 --> 02:09:16,430
举起手来! 吉米 把枪放下!
Let me see your hands! jimmy, drop the fucking gun!

1844
02:09:16,570 --> 02:09:19,330
我不是开玩笑的  吉米! 小心我打爆你的头!
I'm not playing with you, jimmy! I'll blast your fucking head off!

1845
02:09:19,440 --> 02:09:21,240
别开枪! 别开枪!
Don't shoot! don't shoot!

1846
02:09:22,980 --> 02:09:26,070
这是你的枪  还有你的指纹
I got your gun and I got your prints.

1847
02:09:27,380 --> 02:09:30,580
你知道这是什么? 谋杀未遂
You know what you got? you got attempted murder.

1848
02:09:31,790 --> 02:09:33,690
要坐十五年牢!
Fifteen fucking years!

1849
02:09:34,090 --> 02:09:37,420
谋杀未遂和谋杀的判罚是一样的
Attempted murder is the same as murder one, that's a grand jury.

1850
02:09:37,560 --> 02:09:39,790
但是只要你肯跟我们合作
Now, a grand jury could come back favorably.

1851
02:09:39,930 --> 02:09:43,020
我们会让法官站在你这边
It could be reduced to manslaughter.

1852
02:09:43,130 --> 02:09:45,290
也许这只是一般案件
All right? maybe even self-defense.

1853
02:09:45,430 --> 02:09:47,260
甚至是正当防卫
It all just depends on how we wanna deal with you.

1854
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:49,370
让我们来看看接下来会怎么样  吉米?
See where this is fucking going, jimmy?

1855
02:09:49,470 --> 02:09:52,930
我们说你躲过这次  你想想你表哥弗兰克会怎么想?
Let's say you beat it. what you think your cousin frank is gonna think?

1856
02:09:53,070 --> 02:09:55,410
他有一天会知道
Right, he is gonna know, at some point in time,

1857
02:09:55,510 --> 02:09:57,980
我们曾经坐在一起像这样谈话
We sat you down, and we talked to you like this.

1858
02:09:58,110 --> 02:10:00,770
然后在法庭上判你无罪
And then you go to court and you beat attempted murder?

1859
02:10:00,910 --> 02:10:04,370
弗兰克会怎么看?  他可一点也不笨!
What's he gonna think? is he stupid? is your cousin frank stupid?

1860
02:10:04,490 --> 02:10:06,390
回答问题!
Answer him!

1861
02:10:06,490 --> 02:10:09,150
他会认为你已经招供了.
No. he's going to assume that you talked.

1862
02:10:12,360 --> 02:10:14,760
但是现在  弗兰克还不知道你的事
But right now, frank doesn't know.

1863
02:10:14,860 --> 02:10:17,260
你是想让弗兰克在报纸上看到这些呢?
You want frank to read about this in the papers?

1864
02:10:17,360 --> 02:10:19,330
还是想平安地从这里走出去?
Or do you just want to walk out of here?

1865
02:10:19,470 --> 02:10:23,100
没有保释  不会有审判  不会坐牢  你今天就可以回家
No bail, no trial, no jail, just walk out of here today.

1866
02:10:24,200 --> 02:10:25,670
你看着办吧
Your choice.

1867
02:10:35,480 --> 02:10:39,980
罂粟不会因为战争而消失
Opium plants are hard enough to outlive any war.

1868
02:10:41,290 --> 02:10:45,420
美军撤走以后罂粟还会继续开花结果
They'll still be here long after the troops have gone.

1869
02:10:46,790 --> 02:10:51,420
但没有了美国飞机你怎么能运输它们呢?
What are you going to do for transportation when the last us plane goes home?

1870
02:10:51,970 --> 02:10:53,930
我会想办法的
I'll figure something out.

1871
02:10:55,470 --> 02:10:57,840
我会再来找你的  一定
You will see me again, that's for sure.

1872
02:10:59,510 --> 02:11:02,480
我知道这样说不符合我的最佳利益  弗兰克
It is not in my best interest to say this, frank,

1873
02:11:03,010 --> 02:11:05,980
不过激流勇退
But quitting while you're ahead

1874
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:08,480
和放弃是不一样的
Is not the same as quitting.

1875
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:51,790
喂
Yeah. hey.

1876
02:11:51,890 --> 02:11:52,880
叫他过来
Go get him.

1877
02:11:55,800 --> 02:11:58,090
-你要去哪里  -马上我就回来
What are you want to do, baby. one second.

1878
02:11:58,230 --> 02:11:59,930
是我  弗兰克
It's frank. yeah.

1879
02:12:02,470 --> 02:12:03,530
喂
Yeah.

1880
02:12:03,640 --> 02:12:04,930
诺瓦克
Newark.

1881
02:12:05,810 --> 02:12:07,430
临时
Short term,

1882
02:12:07,980 --> 02:12:09,600
3号停车场
Parking lot three.

1883
02:12:10,540 --> 02:12:11,940
临时3号停车场
Short term, lot three.

1884
02:12:12,380 --> 02:12:14,480
就是以前说过的那辆"野马"?
That's the mustang we talking about, right?

1885
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:15,610
车牌号是多少?
okay, right. what's the plate number?

1886
02:12:15,750 --> 02:12:18,220
K-a... k-a...
K-a... k-a...

1887
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:20,450
760  76
760. 76.

1888
02:12:20,590 --> 02:12:22,250
-0  -好
Zero. all right.

1889
02:12:23,620 --> 02:12:25,620
诺瓦克没有临时3号停车场这个地方
There's no short term lot three at newark.

1890
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:27,950
这是个字谜
They got letters. a-b-c-d. I know.

1891
02:12:28,100 --> 02:12:29,890
也许是指时间  3:00?
Maybe he means a time. 3:00?

1892
02:12:30,560 --> 02:12:35,190
这个车牌既不是新泽西的也不是纽约的
This isn't no jersey license plate, nor new york, for that matter.

1893
02:12:35,470 --> 02:12:38,230
-K-a-7-6-0?  -对
K-a-7-6-0? yup.

1894
02:12:39,270 --> 02:12:40,900
基罗  阿尔法?
Kilo alpha?

1895
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:43,070
是飞机的牌号?
A plane tail number?

1896
02:12:43,480 --> 02:12:45,450
基罗  阿尔法 760
Kilo alpha 760.

1897
02:12:46,610 --> 02:12:49,410
你查一下商业飞机  你们查私人飞机
You check commercial planes. you guys check private planes.

1898
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:52,280
从最小的飞机到最大的飞机一个也不要遗漏
Everything, from a little fucking cessna to the biggest fucking whatever jet.

1899
02:12:52,420 --> 02:12:53,480
好吗?
All right?

1900
02:12:53,620 --> 02:12:54,950
我来查军队的飞机  你要去哪里  吉米?
I'll check military planes. where you going, jimmy?

1901
02:12:55,090 --> 02:12:57,250
你哪也不能去...坐下
You're not going anywhere. sit... sit down.

1902
02:13:20,650 --> 02:13:22,080
-机长先生?  -我就是
Captain? yeah?

1903
02:13:22,180 --> 02:13:26,140
瑞奇·罗伯特  伊塞克斯县警察  我知道你在等我们
Richie roberts. essex county. I know you're expecting us.

1904
02:13:26,550 --> 02:13:29,080
这是搜查令  我们要查一下这飞机
Here's our warrant. we're looking on the plane.

1905
02:13:29,190 --> 02:13:30,350
等等! 等等!
Wait! wait!

1906
02:13:30,490 --> 02:13:33,930
斯哥特  拦住这些士兵  检查一下他们的行李
Scotty, stop all these soldiers! check their bags. every one of them.

1907
02:13:44,340 --> 02:13:45,970
破门搜查令
No-knock warrant.

1908
02:13:46,710 --> 02:13:49,300
-先查楼上  -他们要去哪?
All right. start upstairs. where are they going?

1909
02:13:49,410 --> 02:13:50,540
亲爱的  进来
Step in, sweetie.

1910
02:13:51,350 --> 02:13:52,870
夫人  请坐
Ma'am, please sit down.

1911
02:13:53,010 --> 02:13:54,170
这是在干什么?
What is this?

1912
02:13:55,020 --> 02:13:58,470
喂  喂  喂! 停下
Whoa, whoa, whoa! all this stops! hey. hey. hey.

1913
02:13:58,590 --> 02:14:01,490
所有人和物品都不能离开!  减速!
Nothing leaves this area, all right? just slow down with this.

1914
02:14:02,020 --> 02:14:03,990
好吧  把那些卡车拦截下来  别走
All right. stop these trucks. hold on, hold on.

1915
02:14:04,090 --> 02:14:06,030
把机舱璧上的东西都扯下来
Everything off the walls! just pull it all down.

1916
02:14:06,160 --> 02:14:07,460
这可是个庞然大物  瑞奇
Damn thing's a monster, rich.

1917
02:14:07,560 --> 02:14:08,550
这是做什么?
What is this?

1918
02:14:08,700 --> 02:14:09,820
我们要检查这里的每一个人每一件行李
Nothing leaves this area till we've checked it.

1919
02:14:09,930 --> 02:14:11,230
所有东西只有在检查过后才能放行
All right, captain. nothing.

1920
02:14:11,330 --> 02:14:13,360
我们要检查整个飞机  也要查那些卡车
We got to take the plane down, we got to look in the trucks.

1921
02:14:13,500 --> 02:14:14,690
每个人都要检查
Every man here gets searched.

1922
02:14:14,840 --> 02:14:16,200
你看看搜查令就明白了
Read the warrant, sir.

1923
02:14:17,370 --> 02:14:19,840
你丈夫光彩的事业就要结束了
Your husband's illustrious career is over.

1924
02:14:20,670 --> 02:14:23,870
联邦政府会马上过来  带走所有的东西
The feds are gonna come in, gonna take everything.

1925
02:14:24,280 --> 02:14:28,240
在那之前  我得捞点东西
And then they're gonna take it all. but not before I get my gratuity.

1926
02:14:29,380 --> 02:14:30,610
钱放在哪里?
So where's the money?

1927
02:14:30,720 --> 02:14:32,280
你在说什么? 什么钱?
What are you talking about? what money?

1928
02:14:32,390 --> 02:14:33,940
什么钱?
What am I talking about? what money?

1929
02:14:34,050 --> 02:14:38,150
弗兰克存的给所有人的逃命钱
The getaway money that frank and every other gangster keeps in his house.

1930
02:14:38,260 --> 02:14:41,560
如果你现在就走 也许弗兰克不会杀你
If you leave now, there's a chance frank might not kill you.

1931
02:14:43,400 --> 02:14:44,920
闭嘴  坐下
Shut up! sit down!

1932
02:14:45,070 --> 02:14:46,330
坐下
Sit down!

1933
02:15:27,040 --> 02:15:29,370
国防部今天宣布撤退计划
Defense today announced the planned evacuation

1934
02:15:29,480 --> 02:15:32,500
所有余下的美军武装从越南撤离
Of all remaining us combat forces from vietnam,

1935
02:15:32,610 --> 02:15:35,340
对某些人来说消息来的太迟了
News that comes too late for some,

1936
02:15:35,450 --> 02:15:39,080
在这  多佛空军基地庄严的停机坪上
As here, on a solemn tarmac at dover air force base.

1937
02:15:39,220 --> 02:15:42,710
这架c-130运输机装载着令人悲伤的货物
This c-130, loaded down with its sorrowful cargo,

1938
02:15:42,820 --> 02:15:47,060
承载着最英勇的美国士兵  运送他们到最后的安息地
A cargo of America's bravest and best, en route to their final resting places.

1939
02:16:02,740 --> 02:16:04,210
伙计们  把棺材抬下去
You guys. take this coffin down.

1940
02:16:12,750 --> 02:16:14,380
-打开  -我不打
Open it. I'm not doing that.

1941
02:16:21,160 --> 02:16:23,130
狗够凶的啊?
Great fucking dog, huh?

1942
02:16:31,140 --> 02:16:33,000
你马上停下
You stop this, right now.

1943
02:16:33,140 --> 02:16:36,010
我的搜查令有权检查这架飞机
My warrant gives me permission to examine this plane,

1944
02:16:37,310 --> 02:16:38,780
这架飞机和装的货
The plane and its cargo.

1945
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:41,300
好  可是你没得到我的允许
Well, you don't have my permission.

1946
02:16:42,320 --> 02:16:43,780
我不需要你的允许  机长
I don't need it, captain.

1947
02:16:45,490 --> 02:16:48,110
别急  别叫  孩子  嘿  过来
Easy! easy, boy. come on. hey!

1948
02:16:48,990 --> 02:16:50,960
弗兰  让开
Frank, move out of the way.

1949
02:16:58,000 --> 02:16:59,300
该死的
Damn.

1950
02:17:04,170 --> 02:17:05,370
够了
That's enough!

1951
02:17:13,180 --> 02:17:15,150
盯着棺材  别让它们离开你的视线
Stay with these coffins. do not let them out of your sight.

1952
02:17:15,250 --> 02:17:16,550
明白了
Got it. okay.

1953
02:17:18,190 --> 02:17:19,480
嘿  帮我把这个搬开
Hey. help me out with this.

1954
02:17:44,950 --> 02:17:47,380
那是架军用运输机
That was a military transport plane.

1955
02:17:47,510 --> 02:17:48,670
如果上面有海洛因的话
If there was heroin was onboard,

1956
02:17:48,780 --> 02:17:50,580
那一定有军方的人卷入了
Then someone in the military would have to be involved.

1957
02:17:50,720 --> 02:17:53,410
意味着打一场牺牲了5万名士兵的战争的同时
Which means that even as it fights a war that's claimed

1958
02:17:53,550 --> 02:17:57,580
军方正在走私毒品
50,000 American lives, the military is smuggling narcotics.

1959
02:17:57,720 --> 02:18:00,350
那就是对今天这事作出的解释
That is how this event today will be interpreted.

1960
02:18:00,460 --> 02:18:02,090
就因为我们这个机构的某些员工相信
That someone employed by this office

1961
02:18:02,230 --> 02:18:05,930
美国军方参与了毒品走私
Believes that the united states army is in the drug trafficking business

1962
02:18:06,070 --> 02:18:09,230
正在寻找证据  所以不惜这些年轻烈士的遗体被亵渎
And is trying to prove it by desecrating the remains of young men

1963
02:18:09,370 --> 02:18:12,100
他们已经为保家卫国而献身
Who have given their lives in the defense of democracy!

1964
02:18:12,240 --> 02:18:14,760
-这架飞机上有毒品  -闭上你的臭嘴!
There is dope on that plane. shut the fuck up!

1965
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:19,370
你有没有想过你的行为
Is it any wonder, then, because of your actions,

1966
02:18:19,750 --> 02:18:22,040
已经让整个联邦禁毒体系岌岌可危
The entire federal narcotics program is now in jeopardy

1967
02:18:22,150 --> 02:18:25,120
这个体系正在被彻底而疯狂的摧毁
Of being dismantled as completely and enthusiastically

1968
02:18:25,250 --> 02:18:27,050
就像这他妈的运输机吗
As that fucking transport plane?

1969
02:18:27,150 --> 02:18:29,620
这是你杰作  罗伯特先生  你一手造成的
That is what you've accomplished, mr. roberts, single-handedly.

1970
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:31,380
我有可靠的情报
I had good information.

1971
02:18:31,930 --> 02:18:35,290
我调查的目标正在用那架飞机走私毒品
That the target of my investigation was bringing dope in on that plane.

1972
02:18:35,430 --> 02:18:37,360
-目标是谁?  -弗兰克·卢卡斯
And that target is? frank lucas.

1973
02:18:37,460 --> 02:18:39,430

Who? his name's frank lucas.

1974
02:18:39,600 --> 02:18:42,070
谁是弗兰克·卢卡斯  他为谁工作?  为哪个家族?
Who is frank lucas? who does he work for? which family?

1975
02:18:42,170 --> 02:18:44,230
他不是意大利人  他是个黑人
He's not italian. he's black.

1976
02:18:47,770 --> 02:18:50,140
不是在开玩笑吧
Is that supposed to be some kind of a joke?

1977
02:18:50,780 --> 02:18:53,010
你的执法生涯已经接近尾声了
You're this close to the end of your career in law enforcement

1978
02:18:53,110 --> 02:18:54,980
你还在和我开玩笑?
And you're making fucking jokes?

1979
02:18:55,780 --> 02:18:57,910
我的调查显示
My investigation indicates

1980
02:18:58,320 --> 02:19:01,250
弗兰克·卢卡斯在毒品生意中凌驾于黑手党之上
That frank lucas is above the mafia in the dope business.

1981
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:03,420
我的调查还显示
My investigations also indicate

1982
02:19:03,520 --> 02:19:07,550
弗兰克·卢卡斯从东南亚的一个毒品基地直接买货
That frank lucas buys direct from a source in southeast asia.

1983
02:19:07,660 --> 02:19:10,790
他跳过了中间人并且用美军飞机运输
He cuts out the middlemen and uses us military planes

1984
02:19:10,930 --> 02:19:14,770
向国内运送高纯度4号海洛因
And personnel to transport pure #4 heroin into the united states

1985
02:19:14,870 --> 02:19:18,930
而且从1969年开始他就这么干了
And he's been doing so on a regular basis since 1969.

1986
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:21,940
我有弗兰克·卢卡斯团伙中每个成员的案底
I have cases against every member of frank's organization.

1987
02:19:22,040 --> 02:19:23,130
弗兰克·卢卡斯的团伙?
Frank's organization?

1988
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:27,010
没有黑鬼能做到黑手党花了100年都没做成的事情
No fucking nigger has ever accomplished what the American mafia hasn't in 100 years

1989
02:19:27,150 --> 02:19:30,080
你知道为什么吗  就因为你他妈的是头蠢猪
And you would know that how? why? 'cause your head is stuck up your fucking ass?

1990
02:19:30,180 --> 02:19:32,520
嘿  帮我个忙  把这个该死的犹太佬赶出去
Hey, lou, do me a favor. will you get this fucking kike out of here?

1991
02:19:32,650 --> 02:19:34,120
犹太佬?  犹太佬?
Kike? kike?

1992
02:19:34,220 --> 02:19:35,280
瑞奇  不要
Richie, no.

1993
02:19:38,830 --> 02:19:39,950
嘿  瑞奇
Hey, richie!

1994
02:19:41,390 --> 02:19:42,520
坚持下去
Make it stick.

1995
02:19:43,330 --> 02:19:45,800
斯比尔曼在跟踪那些棺材  他们离这儿有四分之一英里远
Spearman's with the coffins. they're about a quarter mile away.

1996
02:20:17,060 --> 02:20:18,360
德克
Doctor.

1997
02:20:20,200 --> 02:20:21,330
怎么了?
What?

1998
02:20:21,870 --> 02:20:24,840
该死的特鲁普去家里捣乱了  兄弟  情况很糟
Fucking trupo came by the house, man. it's bad.

1999
02:20:39,720 --> 02:20:42,750
弗兰克  我有话要和你说
Frankie, I need to speak with you a minute. please?

2000
02:20:42,890 --> 02:20:45,720

2002

谢谢
Thank you.

2003
02:20:49,900 --> 02:20:51,860
-妈我得走了  好吗?  -就几句话

2005
02:20:53,370 --> 02:20:55,160
拜托了  坐下  就几句话
Please, sit down. just a few words.

2006
02:20:55,770 --> 02:20:57,360
我一直在想这些事
I've been thinking about some things.

2007
02:20:57,470 --> 02:21:01,000
你知道  如果你是个布道者  你兄弟也会是布道者
If you'd been a preacher, your brothers would have been preachers.

2008
02:21:01,110 --> 02:21:02,170
是的
Right.

2009
02:21:02,280 --> 02:21:06,210
如果你是一名士兵  他们也会是士兵  你知道的
If you'd been a soldier, they'd be soldiers. you know that.

2010
02:21:06,310 --> 02:21:09,940
他们因你而来  是你打电话叫他们来投奔你
They came here because of you. you called and they came running.

2011
02:21:10,080 --> 02:21:11,070
是
Right.

2012
02:21:11,220 --> 02:21:14,620
那是因为他们都很崇拜你
That's because they look up to you.

2013
02:21:14,750 --> 02:21:18,550
他们一直认定你知道应该怎样做
They always expect you to know what's best.

2014
02:21:19,330 --> 02:21:21,290
就连他们也知道...
But even they know

2015
02:21:21,590 --> 02:21:23,390
你不会杀警察
You don't shoot cops.

2016
02:21:25,470 --> 02:21:27,090
这连我也知道
Even I know that.

2017
02:21:28,270 --> 02:21:29,740
-伊娃也知道  -好了  妈
Eva knows it. all right, ma.

2018
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:32,330
看来唯一不清楚这一点的是你!
The only one who doesn't seem to know is you!

2019
02:21:32,440 --> 02:21:35,570
好了  妈  我要走了  我保证不会杀任何人
All right, ma. I got to go. I promise you, I ain't gonna shoot nobody.

2020
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:39,440
我从没问过你这一切从哪来的  因为我不想听你说谎
I never asked you where all this came from because I didn't want to hear you lie.

2021
02:21:39,580 --> 02:21:41,670
我不想你担心  现在我得走了
I didn't want you to worry about it. now, come on, I got to go.

2022
02:21:41,780 --> 02:21:43,250
别对我说谎!
Don't lie to me!

2023
02:21:47,790 --> 02:21:49,250
别那样做
Don't do that.

2024
02:21:50,920 --> 02:21:54,260
你想把事情弄糟
Do you want to make things so bad

2025
02:21:54,360 --> 02:21:57,190
而让你的家人离你而去吗  他们会的

02:22:00,870 --> 02:22:01,890

我也会离开你!

2030
02:22:33,830 --> 02:22:35,630
棺材要被运走了  瑞奇
Got coffins on the move, richie.

2031
02:22:35,740 --> 02:22:38,860

We want the transport coffins, not the ceremonial ones.

2032
02:22:40,410 --> 02:22:41,870

Hands up against the wall. stay back.

2135
02:32:53,090 --> 02:32:54,420
伙计

Don't you owe me money? I'll get you some more. here you go.

趴下  混蛋
Down on the ground, motherfucker!

2141
02:33:45,640 --> 02:33:50,270
为国捐躯的烈士们回家了
...dead servicemen returning from defending our country in vietnam...

2142
02:33:52,810 --> 02:33:55,750
在那
Over there. okay.

2143
02:34:01,320 --> 02:34:04,290
女士们先生们  在诉讼阶段
Ladies and gentlemen, at this stage of the proceedings

2144
02:34:04,390 --> 02:34:07,260
双方律师已经准备好发表公开的陈述
The counsels are ready for their opening statements.

2145
02:34:07,790 --> 02:34:10,820
检方代表  罗伯特先生会率先
For the prosecution, mr. roberts will proceed

2146
02:34:10,960 --> 02:34:13,260
发表他的公开陈述
With his opening statement first.

2147
02:34:13,730 --> 02:34:17,600
罗伯特先生  你准备好发言了吗
Mr. roberts, are you ready to proceed?

2148
02:34:19,210 --> 02:34:20,830
是的  法官大人
Yes, your honor.

2149
02:34:24,910 --> 02:34:27,470
陪审团的女士们  先生们
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

2150
02:34:31,850 --> 02:34:35,290
你们即将听到的这份发言会说明
The state will show and you will hear

2151
02:34:35,860 --> 02:34:38,720
弗兰克·卢卡斯是我们城市中
That frank lucas is the most dangerous man

2152
02:34:39,790 --> 02:34:42,090
最危险的人物
Walking the streets of our city.

2153
02:34:44,830 --> 02:34:48,730
你们都出去吧  让我和瑞奇先生单独谈谈
All right, y'all, get on out. let me talk to mr. richie alone.

2154
02:34:51,840 --> 02:34:55,240
快点  快点  我是按小时付你们钱的  不是按分钟
Come on, come on, come on. I pay y'all by the hour, not by the minute.

2155
02:34:58,040 --> 02:34:59,370
谢谢
Thank you.

2156
02:35:04,020 --> 02:35:06,250
你身上没装窃听器吧?
You ain't wearing a wire, are you?

2157
02:35:07,050 --> 02:35:08,080
没有
No.

2158
02:35:09,260 --> 02:35:10,310
好的
All right.

2159
02:35:10,420 --> 02:35:14,760
我和律师们谈过了  我不敢相信他们说的
I was talking to my lawyers. they said something to me, I can't believe it.

2160
02:35:16,230 --> 02:35:19,430
你真的把在车后箱发现的
Did you really find a million dollars in the trunk of a car

2161
02:35:19,570 --> 02:35:21,260
-一百万美金上缴了?  你这么做了?  -对
And then turn it in? did you do that? yeah.

2162
02:35:21,400 --> 02:35:22,770
你真这么做了?
You did that for real, huh?

2163
02:35:22,900 --> 02:35:26,100
伙计  好样的  妈的
My man. good for you. shit.

2164
02:35:26,240 --> 02:35:28,330
-你知道强尼·罗拿了这笔钱  对吗
You know johnny law got, though, right?

2165
02:35:28,540 --> 02:35:30,530
关于这事  瑞奇先生
About it, mr. richie.

2166
02:35:30,640 --> 02:35:32,870
你知道他拿了  他把你上缴的钱拿了
You know he got it. you turned that money in,

2167
02:35:32,980 --> 02:35:35,500
而你什么也捞不到  对吧?
He took it and you ain't get nothing for it. did you?

2168
02:35:35,610 --> 02:35:37,050
你为什么要这样做呢?
Why did you do that?

2169
02:35:37,450 --> 02:35:39,780
-我做的是正确的事  -这倒是真的
It was the right thing to do. that's true.

2170
02:35:40,220 --> 02:35:42,190
多好的答案  你所做的是正确的
That's a good answer. it was the right thing to do.

2171
02:35:42,320 --> 02:35:44,520
我一直在追问自己
The question I have, the question I've been asking myself is,

2172
02:35:44,620 --> 02:35:46,220
如果再有这种情况  你还会这样做吗
Would you do it again?

2173
02:35:47,490 --> 02:35:50,390
我的意思是  那是一大笔钱  而且也是很久以前了
I mean, that's a lot of money, that's a long time ago.

2174
02:35:50,830 --> 02:35:54,360
现在你也许有很多车贷要还  还要付孩子的抚养费
Many car payments ago, many child support payments ago.

2175
02:35:56,140 --> 02:35:59,970
所以我对自己说  找出答案的唯一方法就是再试一次
So I said to myself, the onlyest way to find out is to find out.

2176
02:36:01,510 --> 02:36:07,280
贿赂  敲诈  谋杀  诈骗...
Bribery, extortion, murder, racketeering...

2177
02:36:09,250 --> 02:36:10,980
如果你告诉我地址
Now, you give me an address,

2178
02:36:11,120 --> 02:36:14,380
我保证有辆车会停在那  钱就在后备箱里
I'll make sure the car's there, I'll make sure that money's in that trunk.

2179
02:36:14,490 --> 02:36:15,890
不用了  谢谢
No, thanks.

2180
02:36:16,260 --> 02:36:17,550
你确定?
You sure?

2181
02:36:19,360 --> 02:36:22,260
算了吧  瑞奇  你以为这样就能让我佩服你?
Come on, now, richie. what do you think, that impresses me?

2182
02:36:22,460 --> 02:36:25,430
你认为你比他们强?  其实好不到哪儿去
You think that you're better than them? you ain't no better than them other cops.

2183
02:36:25,530 --> 02:36:27,760
事实上  你和他们一样  你就是他们中的一员
In fact, you're the same as them. you are them.

2184
02:36:28,500 --> 02:36:29,830
我来问问你
Let me ask you this.

2185
02:36:29,970 --> 02:36:33,100
你真认为把我关进监狱
Do you really think that putting me behind bars

2186
02:36:33,210 --> 02:36:35,110
就能改变一切了
Is going to change anything on them streets?

2187
02:36:35,210 --> 02:36:36,830
那些隐君子们还是会继续吸毒
Them dope fiends is gonna shoot it,

2188
02:36:36,940 --> 02:36:39,070
他们会去偷窃  他们会为毒品而死
They're gonna steal for it, they're gonna die for it.

2189
02:36:39,180 --> 02:36:41,940
把我送进牢里改变不了任何事
Putting me in or out ain't gonna change one thing.

2190
02:36:42,310 --> 02:36:43,580
事实就是如此
Then that's the way it is.

2191
02:36:43,680 --> 02:36:45,510
事实如此  我们又得到了什么呢  瑞奇?
That's just the way it is. so what we got, richie?

2192
02:36:45,720 --> 02:36:47,480
你我坐在这里
We got me and you sitting here.

2193
02:36:47,790 --> 02:36:50,690
还有那个帮我兄弟开车的告密司机
We got that little snitch-ass driver for my brother.

2194
02:36:50,790 --> 02:36:52,260
你还找到了一些白粉
You got a little bit of powder.

2195
02:36:52,560 --> 02:36:54,420
你要的远不止这些  瑞奇
You're going to need more than that, richie.

2196
02:36:54,690 --> 02:36:58,190
我知道赃物  货源  同谋  贿赂检察官
I got possession, supply, conspiracy,

2197
02:36:58,400 --> 02:37:02,490
我有人证看到你残忍杀人
Bribing a law officer. I got people who'll attest to seeing you kill in cold blood.

2198
02:37:02,640 --> 02:37:06,540
我有你海外银行的帐户  你的不动产  你的生意
I got your offshore bank accounts, your real estate, your businesses,

2199
02:37:06,670 --> 02:37:09,140
都是你卖海洛因得到的钱
All bought with money from heroin.

2200
02:37:09,480 --> 02:37:12,210
我有上百个失去孩子的父母
And I got hundreds of parents of dead kids.

2201
02:37:12,650 --> 02:37:15,140
孩子因为你的毒品而上瘾  这就是我要告诉陪审团的
Addicts who od'ed on your product. and that's my story for the jury.

2202
02:37:15,250 --> 02:37:18,810
这就是我为何如此坚持  你谋杀了数千条人命
And that's how I make it all stick. "this man murdered thousands of people.

2203
02:37:18,920 --> 02:37:20,890
却享受着豪宅  开着林肯车
"and he did it from a penthouse, driving a lincoln."

2204
02:37:21,020 --> 02:37:22,820
除了这些  你没什么好担心的
Aside from that, you got nothing to worry about.

2205
02:37:22,920 --> 02:37:25,790
干的不错  那就是我们上法庭的目的  对吧?  瑞奇
That's pretty good. but that's why we go to court, isn't it, richie?

2206
02:37:25,890 --> 02:37:27,320
因为我也有证人
Cause I got witnesses, too.

2207
02:37:27,560 --> 02:37:31,520
我有娱乐明星  体育明星  我掌握了哈林区
I got celebrities. I got sports figures. I got harlem, richie.

2208
02:37:32,060 --> 02:37:35,860
我罩着哈林区  所以哈林区也会支持我  你要相信这点
I took care of harlem, so harlem's gonna take care of me. you can believe that.

2209
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,470
-我还有更多的  弗兰克  -你还有什么?
I got more than that, frank. what you got?

2210
02:37:38,570 --> 02:37:41,230
我还有一票人想要指证你
I've got a line of people wanting to testify against you,

2211
02:37:41,370 --> 02:37:43,710
他们挤破了门  围满了街头
It stretches out the door and around the block.

2212
02:37:43,840 --> 02:37:47,640
你毁了无数生命  弗兰克  我有玛扎诺犯罪家族
You damaged a lot of lives, frank. I got the mazzano crime family.

2213
02:37:47,750 --> 02:37:49,340
还记得那些家伙吗  你让他们破了产
Remember those boys? you put them out of business.

2214
02:37:49,450 --> 02:37:51,010
我与玛扎诺家族毫无关系
I ain't got nothing to do with no mazzanos.

2215
02:37:51,120 --> 02:37:52,170
玛扎诺家族和我也没半点牵连
Mazzanos ain't got nothing to do with me.

2216
02:37:52,280 --> 02:37:53,680
他们和你的关系太大了  他们要扳倒你
They got everything to do with you. what, they...

2217
02:37:53,790 --> 02:37:54,840
-你知道为什么吗  -为什么
You know why? why?

2218
02:37:54,950 --> 02:37:57,510
因为他们实际上对你恨之入骨
Because apart from the fact that they hate you personally,

2219
02:37:58,020 --> 02:37:59,350
恨你所代表的
They hate what you represent.

2220
02:37:59,460 --> 02:38:02,520
-我谁也不代表  除了我自己  -你确定?
I don't represent nothing but frank lucas. you sure?

2221
02:38:02,930 --> 02:38:04,860
像你这样的黑人商人
A black businessman like you?

2222
02:38:05,300 --> 02:38:06,820
你代表的是进步
You represent progress.

2223
02:38:07,570 --> 02:38:10,560
这种进步会让他们损失惨重
The kind of progress that's going to see them lose a lot of money.

2224
02:38:11,140 --> 02:38:14,700
你消失了  一切都会恢复正常
With you out of the way, everything can return to normal.

2225
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:17,070
兄弟啊
My man.

2226
02:38:21,910 --> 02:38:23,910
你知道正常对我来说意味着什么?
You know what normal is to me, richie?

2227
02:38:24,220 --> 02:38:27,120
我6岁起就没见过正常的事
I ain't seen normal since I was six years old.

2228
02:38:28,750 --> 02:38:31,350
正常的事是目睹警察来到我家
Normal is seeing the police right up to my house

2229
02:38:31,460 --> 02:38:34,390
拖走我仅12岁的堂兄  把他绑在柱子上
Dragging my little 12-year-old cousin out, tying him to a pole,

2230
02:38:34,490 --> 02:38:37,620
用枪在他嘴里猛捣  把他的牙都打碎了
Shoving a shotgun in his mouth so hard they bust his teeth.

2231
02:38:37,760 --> 02:38:41,030
接着对他的头来了两枪
Then they bust two shotgun shells in his head and knock his fucking head off.

2232
02:38:41,130 --> 02:38:42,360
那对我来说就是正常的事
That's what normal is to me.

2233
02:38:42,470 --> 02:38:45,530
从那时开始我就鄙视警察...
I didn't give a fuck about no police then.

2234
02:38:45,640 --> 02:38:48,610

I don't give a fuck about no police now. shit.

2235

2236

So, it don't mean nothing to me for you to show up tomorrow morning

2237
02:38:53,950 --> 02:38:56,410

弗兰克  规矩点
Yeah, frank. get in line.

2239
02:38:59,990 --> 02:39:02,220
那只会让你罪加一等
That one stretches around the block, too.

2240
02:39:05,620 --> 02:39:06,960
好吧

你想怎样?

2242
02:39:18,840 --> 02:39:20,500
你知道该怎么做
You know what you got to do.

2243
02:39:20,670 --> 02:39:22,440
你想要我干什么?  做污点证人?
What do you want me to do? snitch, huh?

2244
02:39:22,540 --> 02:39:24,010
我知道你不想让我供出警察
I know you don't want me to give up no cops.

2245
02:39:24,140 --> 02:39:25,610
你想要什么?  黑帮分子?
What do you want? you want gangsters?

挑一个吧  犹太帮?  爱尔兰帮?  法国帮?
Pick one. jew gangsters? mick gangsters? guineas?

They've been bleeding harlem dry since they got off the boat, richie.

2248
02:39:33,390 --> 02:39:37,190
我他妈的不在乎这些犯罪分子  你可以抓他们
I don't give a fuck about no crime figures. you can have them.

2249
02:39:38,190 --> 02:39:39,620
这些我也要
I'll take them, too.

2250
02:39:39,890 --> 02:39:41,790
这些你也要?
You'll take them, too?

2251
02:39:46,970 --> 02:39:50,630
你不会吧  你说的是警察  你想要警察?
No, you didn't. you're talking about police. you want police?

2252
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:52,330
你要抓自己人?
You want your own kind?

2253
02:39:52,440 --> 02:39:53,700
他们不是我自己人
They're not my kind.

2254

他们和你做交易  弗兰克  他们不是自己人
They're in business with you, frank. they ain't my kind.

2255

They ain't my kind like the italians are not yours. all right?

2256

Huh.

Now you can live life rich in jail for the rest of your born days,

2263
02:40:36,720 --> 02:40:38,770
