这就是问题所在,美国到底怎么了
This is the problem. This is what's wrong with America.

17

业主的荣誉感在哪儿?
Where's the pride of ownership, huh?

22
00:02:58,30 --> 00:03:00,71
个人服务在哪儿?
Where's the personal service?

23
00:03:07,74 --> 00:03:11,04
知道我的意思了么? 操
You see what I mean? Shit.

24
00:03:12,83 --> 00:03:17,08
我是说他们有什么权利砍掉所有的供应商
I mean, what right do they have, of cutting out the suppliers,

25
00:03:17,09 --> 00:03:20,52
把所有的中间商都踢出局
pushing out all the middlemen,

26
00:03:20,87 --> 00:03:24,73
而直接从制造商购买

27
00:03:25,57 --> 00:03:28,86
索尼这个,东芝那个
Sony this, Toshiba that.

28
00:03:29,30 --> 00:03:33,61
全是连锁,让美国人全都失业

00:03:45,87 --> 00:03:47,60
你没事吧?
You all right?

31
00:03:47,95 --> 00:03:54,81
实在让人有心无力
You can't find the heart of anything

32
00:03:52,27 --> 00:03:54,07
to stick the knife.

33
00:03:56,68 --> 00:04:00,42
嗨,有人么
Hey!

34
00:03:58,41 --> 00:04:00,16

00:04:06,62 --> 00:04:08,88

I would've thought that Bumpy would put out a better spread, you know?

58
00:05:03,65 --> 00:05:04,72
想来点儿么?

我想吃鸡翅...

61
00:05:08,63 --> 00:05:10,03

他都不知道是谁打了他
He didn't know what hit him, you know what I'm saying?

63
00:05:11,93 --> 00:05:14,57
我就当着他面这么说因为我根本不在乎
I just kept popping him in the face 'cause that's what I do.

64
00:05:16,74 --> 00:05:17,95

Would you like a drink, sir?

76
00:05:54,16 --> 00:05:56,87
Give him a scotch on the rocks.

你会好的
-You gonna be all right? -Yeah.

82
00:06:20,65 --> 00:06:21,88
对
I'm sure Bumpy didn't say anything to you, but he made me promise

83
00:06:21,89 --> 00:06:26,21
我知道爸爸没有对你说过什么,但是他要我保证如果他发生意外的话

84
00:06:24,44 --> 00:06:26,70
that if anything ever happened to him,

85
00:06:26,74 --> 00:06:29,58
我要全力支持你上位

非常感激

You know, half the people in this room owed Bumpy money when he died.

88
00:06:37,28 --> 00:06:40,23

They think I'm gonna forget to collect, but I'm gonna get that money.

89
00:06:40,58 --> 00:06:42,93
不错,挺有精神
Well, that's the spirit. Go get 'em.

90
00:06:42,94 --> 00:06:44,63
去搞定他们

Class, you'll be critiquing Mr Roberts, so pay attention.

97
00:07:04,75 --> 00:07:06,98
我讨厌被点名
I hate hearing my name called, you know?

98
00:07:06,99 --> 00:07:10,00
那意味着我要在全班面前起立,我要转过身去
It means I gotta get up in front of the class, I gotta turn around,

99
00:07:10,01 --> 00:07:13,11
我知道那儿的所有人都比我懂得多
and I know every one of those people there, they know more than I do.

100
00:07:14,31 --> 00:07:16,99
人类的第一恐惧不是死亡
The number one fear of people, it ain't dying, it's public speaking.

101
00:07:17,00 --> 00:07:18,34
是演讲
I get physically ill, I wanna throw up.

102
00:07:18,35 --> 00:07:19,91
我在生理上感到恶心,想吐

103
00:07:19,92 --> 00:07:21,72
谁让你就想靠那个讨生计
And that's what you wanna do for a living.

104
00:07:21,73 --> 00:07:23,85
不,我不想变成那样
No, I don't wanna be like that, man, I wanna beat it.

105
00:07:23,86 --> 00:07:25,22
那么,由我来动手?
So, should I do this?

106
00:07:25,23 --> 00:07:26,65
不用,他会接受的,他认识我
No, he'll take it from me, he knows me. I've known him since high school.

107
00:07:26,66 --> 00:07:27,74
我从高中就认识他了
-From high school? -Good morning. Yeah.

108
00:07:27,75 --> 00:07:29,06
- 高中? - 早上好

109
00:07:29,71 --> 00:07:32,51
拿着,他要是不接就扔进去,服务到位
He doesn't take it, just throw it in. It's good service.

110
00:07:32,52 --> 00:07:33,48
扔进去?
-Throw it in? All right. -Yeah.

111
00:07:33,49 --> 00:07:35,10
- 对 - 好的

112

113
00:07:37,04 --> 00:07:37,93
你好,J
-How you doing, baby? -All right.

114
00:07:37,94 --> 00:07:39,14

Hey! That's his head!

118
00:08:07,87 --> 00:08:11,88
你他妈的混球咬了我的手
You're supposed to be my friend, asshole!

119
00:08:12,55 --> 00:08:14,94
Richie,我发誓我当时不知道那是你
CAMPIZl: I swear to God, Richie, I didn't know it was you.

120
00:08:14,95 --> 00:08:18,42
我绝不会把门砸到你手上,绝对不会
I would never slam a door on your hand, knowingly.

121
00:08:18,43 --> 00:08:19,87
你他妈的咬了我的手
You bit my fucking hand.

122
00:08:19,88 --> 00:08:21,64
你怎么干上送传票这活了
What are you doing serving subpoenas, anyway?

123
00:08:21,65 --> 00:08:23,60
- 我想从县里贷点钱 - 县里?
We're on loan to County. -County?

124
00:08:23,61 --> 00:08:24,92
这对你管用么
-How's that working out for you? Hey, fuck you.

125
00:08:24,93 --> 00:08:25,90
去你妈的
Hey, I'm sorry. Consider me served. Can we leave it there?

126
00:08:25,91 --> 00:08:29,99
嗨,我道歉, 我感觉你们的服务不好,这事咱能不能就这么算了?

127
00:08:30,00 --> 00:08:32,99
袭击警员? 我看没戏
Assault on a police officer? I don't think so.

128
00:08:33,00 --> 00:08:36,91
看在过去的面子上,我们能怎么办,你想要什么,我能给你什么
Hey, for old times' sake. What can we do? What do you want? What can I give you?

129
00:08:36,92 --> 00:08:39,20
J,贩卖致命武器怎么判?
What do you get for assault with a deadly weapon, Jay?

130
00:08:39,21 --> 00:08:40,47
起码蹲上五年
-Five years minimum. Five years.

131
00:08:40,48 --> 00:08:41,34
五年
Guys, come on. No, guys. What do you want? Who do you want?

132
00:08:41,35 --> 00:08:43,48
别这样伙计们,别

133
00:08:43,49 --> 00:08:45,65
你要什么,你想知道谁

134

你知道什么
Who do you got?

135

他在那儿
There he is.

140

就是他,他就是下注人
That's him. That's the bookie.

CAMPIZl: This is... I'd rather not. Come on. Let's go.

144
00:09:13,32 --> 00:09:14,48
这...你真是疯了

145
00:09:14,49 --> 00:09:16,37
来吧,我们走

146
00:09:16,75 --> 00:09:18,40
冷静点
Take it ease.

147
00:09:37,95 --> 00:09:39,87
我们是跟人还是跟车
Want to stay with him or the car?

148
00:09:40,20 --> 00:09:42,27
我们看看车里有什么
Let's see who comes for the car.

149
00:09:57,32 --> 00:09:58,87
你说我们是不是被耍了
Think he made us?

150
00:09:59,46 --> 00:10:00,96
你打电话要搜查令了,对么?
You called in the warrants, right? So, where are they?

151
00:10:00,97 --> 00:10:01,86
他们在哪儿
I just called, man.

152
00:10:01,87 --> 00:10:03,53
我刚打完电话

153
00:10:03,54 --> 00:10:06,86
打完电话走回来,这才过去十秒钟
I called and walked back here and 10 seconds has gone by.

154
00:10:09,86 --> 00:10:11,74
我看到他拿赌博彩票了,J
I saw him with the slips, Jay.

155
00:10:11,75 --> 00:10:13,15
你看到赌博彩票了?
You saw policy slips? You saw grocery bags. You don't know what's in 'em.

156
00:10:13,16 --> 00:10:15,44
你看到了杂货袋,你不知道里面装的是什么

157
00:10:15,45 --> 00:10:18,18
我知道,你也知道,别跟我扯了
Yes, I do and so do you. Don't give me that bull.

158
00:10:18,19 --> 00:10:21,30
着什么急Richie,半个小时后搜查令就到了
What's the rush, Richie? Half an hour, the warrant will be here.

159
00:10:21,31 --> 00:10:22,01
我今晚还有课呢?
-I got night school, all right? -Guess you're gonna miss it.

160
00:10:22,02 --> 00:10:23,55
估计你赶不上了

161
00:10:32,83 --> 00:10:34,13
去他妈的,我们走
Fuck this. Come on. -You sure?

162
00:10:34,14 --> 00:10:36,45
- 你说真的? - 是,说真的,我们走
Yeah, I'm sure. Let's go.

163
00:11:29,69 --> 00:11:33,81
操,J
Fuck.

164
00:11:32,67 --> 00:11:34,04
-Jay. -Yeah?

165
00:11:40,57 --> 00:11:42,25
我操
Fuck.

166
00:11:46,06 --> 00:11:48,35
WBZ, honey bunch, the show they all love!

167
00:11:48,48 --> 00:11:50,77
It's the groovy sound of the Jefferson Kaye Saturday Night Show:

168
00:11:50,89 --> 00:11:53,06
Dig, honey, it's coming up time for news:

169
00:11:53,19 --> 00:11:55,82
Jumping on the ceiling, wallpaper peeling on WBZ:

170
00:11:55,94 --> 00:11:58,28
Stick around, the Jace-man's got 10: Back in 10:

171
00:12:06,02 --> 00:12:07,29
那可不是几美元小钱
It's not just a couple of bucks, all right?

172
00:12:07,30 --> 00:12:09,58
原则上讲性质一样
It's the same thing in principle.

173
00:12:10,25 --> 00:12:11,58
哦,我们在讨论原则么?
Oh, are we talking principles?

174
00:12:11,59 --> 00:12:15,37
Richie,一个警察上交这样的钱只说明一件事
Richie, a cop who turns in this kind of money, says one thing.

175
00:12:15,38 --> 00:12:17,76
这个警察会收黑钱
He turns in cops who take money. We'll be fucking pariahs.

176
00:12:17,77 --> 00:12:19,11
我们就会被所有人排斥
Yeah, well, then we're fucked both ways.

177
00:12:19,12 --> 00:12:20,58
对,那我们就里外不是人

178
00:12:20,59 --> 00:12:24,94
要是我们不黑这钱那你说的对,我们就惨了 可要是我们把这钱自己留着就没事
Not if we keep it. Only if we don't, then you're right, we're fucked.

179
00:12:23,51 --> 00:12:25,39
But not if we keep it.

180
00:12:26,26 --> 00:12:28,72
该死,是我们想要这么做的么?
God damn it, man! Did we ask for this?

181
00:12:28,73 --> 00:12:31,26
难道我们用枪指着人脑袋说"把钱给我们"了么?
Did we put a gun to someone's head and say, "Give us your money"?

182
00:12:31,87 --> 00:12:36,02
警察自相残杀,他们不可信
Cops kill cops they can't trust.

183
00:12:39,29 --> 00:12:41,24
我们不能上交这钱
We can't turn it in, man.

184
00:12:50,59 --> 00:12:52,38
Can you believe that?

185
00:13:01,33 --> 00:13:03,06
这是多少钱
How much is it?

186
00:13:03,64 --> 00:13:06,36
98万7千美元
$987,000.

187
00:13:08,08 --> 00:13:10,51
哪剩余的钱呢?
Well, what happened to the rest of it?

188
00:13:13,01 --> 00:13:15,11
你干吗在这么多人面前点钱?
What the hell are you doing counting it out here in front of everybody?

189
00:13:15,12 --> 00:13:16,59
你疯了么
Are you nuts?

190
00:13:17,30 --> 00:13:21,28
装回袋子,封存好上交
Get it back in the bags, seal them up and down into the property room.

191
00:13:31,74 --> 00:13:33,64
循规蹈矩的混帐
You fucking Boy Scout.

192
00:13:57,55 --> 00:14:00,76
怎么了,还想说什么?
What? What?

193
00:14:14,63 --> 00:14:18,67
纽约市警察局

194
00:14:19,83 --> 00:14:21,99
证物室

195
00:14:24,48 --> 00:14:26,37
Trupo警探,在这儿签字
Detective Trupo, sign here.

196
00:14:30,65 --> 00:14:32,74
你们准备好挣笔大钱么
You guys ready to make a lot of fucking money?

197
00:14:32,75 --> 00:14:33,77
一直准备着
Always. Hell, yeah.

198
00:14:33,78 --> 00:14:35,10
当然
Fucking A.

199
00:14:38,89 --> 00:14:40,29
拿着
Oh, look at this.

200
00:14:39,13 --> 00:14:40,21
There you go.

201
00:14:40,88 --> 00:14:43,71
All right, look at this. Fucking beautiful.

202
00:14:43,70 --> 00:14:45,55
还有3包
There's three more boats.

203
00:14:53,01 --> 00:14:55,40
一点儿也别洒掉
Hey, don't lose any of that shit.

204
00:14:55,41 --> 00:14:55,97
明白
I know. All right, be careful.

205
00:14:55,98 --> 00:14:57,54
小心点

206
00:15:01,53 --> 00:15:03,79
那些做实验试剂足够了
Hey! Just enough for the reagent test.

207
00:15:05,12 --> 00:15:07,05
再少一点儿
A little less.

208
00:15:12,32 --> 00:15:14,80
那批毒品是从法国进的
ROSSl: This is the French Connection dope:

209
00:15:14,81 --> 00:15:19,19
就是Popeye Doyle以及Sonny Grasso从我们这买的货
Kilos of the same dope Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso took from us:

210
00:15:19,20 --> 00:15:24,07
被条子发现了,逮捕了所有人并开始从证物室向外倒卖
The cops seize it, arrest everyone,

211
00:15:21,80 --> 00:15:24,18
then they start taking it out of the evidence room,

212
00:15:24,08 --> 00:15:27,57
分成一份份的又卖回给我们
whacking it down to nothing and selling it back to us:

213
00:15:27,58 --> 00:15:30,30
他们基本上靠这个控制了市场
They basically control the market with it:

214
00:15:30,31 --> 00:15:32,73
Rossi先生,给你点惊喜
Mr Rossi, I have a surprise for you.

215
00:15:32,74 --> 00:15:34,16
他们这么干已经有好几年了
ROSSl: They've been doing it for years now: They live off it, our dope:

216
00:15:34,17 --> 00:15:36,73
靠我们的货维生

217
00:15:36,74 --> 00:15:39,51
这世界到底他妈怎么了,Frank
What do you think?

218
00:15:37,32 --> 00:15:39,15
What the fuck is happening to the world, Frank?

219
00:15:39,52 --> 00:15:41,55
该死的无赖
Those fucking crooks.

220
00:15:41,56 --> 00:15:43,91
是啊,真为Bumpy感到难过
Yeah. Sad about Bumpy.

221
00:15:46,12 --> 00:15:48,28
哈林区再也不会和从前一样了
Things are never gonna be the same in Harlem.

222
00:15:48,56 --> 00:15:50,04
以前你走在街上
You walk down the street, nobody bothers you 'cause Bumpy was making sure of it.

223
00:15:50,05 --> 00:15:53,01
没人会招惹你,因为Bumpy在主持大局

224
00:15:53,80 --> 00:15:55,64
来块蛋糕把
Half a key.

225
00:15:55,65 --> 00:15:57,33
你现在怎么样
How is your day now?

226
00:15:58,18 --> 00:16:00,58
一团糟,每个人都在各自为战
It's chaos. Every gorilla for hisself.

227
00:16:03,25 --> 00:16:04,74
滚蛋!
Motherfucker!

228
00:16:07,54 --> 00:16:09,61
我们不能这样活下去
Who can live like that? There has to be order.

229
00:16:09,62 --> 00:16:13,53
必须要有秩序,这种事绝对不会发生在意大利人身上

230
00:16:11,56 --> 00:16:13,52
That would never happen with Italians.

231
00:16:13,54 --> 00:16:16,30
比任何人生命更重要的是...
More important than any one man's life, is order.

232
00:16:16,31 --> 00:16:18,10
...秩序

233
00:16:25,09 --> 00:16:26,62
Frank
Frank.

234
00:16:27,48 --> 00:16:30,58
进来把哥们,坐
Hey. Come on in, Claude. Sit down.

235
00:16:35,64 --> 00:16:36,83
你们好么
How y'all doing, huh? -Good.

236
00:16:36,84 --> 00:16:37,50
很好
So, you see Nate over there? Yeah?

237
00:16:37,51 --> 00:16:39,08
这么说你们在那边儿见到Nate了

238
00:16:39,09 --> 00:16:41,54
当然,经常见,Nate无处不在
Yeah, all the time.

239
00:16:41,55 --> 00:16:42,43
他很好
-Nate is everywhere. He's good. -Yeah.

240
00:16:42,44 --> 00:16:43,32
- 他还在那儿? - 是的
-He's still over there? -Yeah. He's got himself a club now.

241
00:16:43,33 --> 00:16:45,39
他现在有了自己的酒吧了

242
00:16:45,40 --> 00:16:46,61
在哪儿,西贡?
-Okay. Whereabouts, Saigon? Bangkok.

243
00:16:46,62 --> 00:16:47,93
- 是曼谷 - 曼谷?
-Bangkok? -I don't think he's ever coming home.

244
00:16:47,94 --> 00:16:49,96
是,我看他是不会回来了

245
00:16:54,74 --> 00:16:56,23
来把
Come on.

246
00:17:22,30 --> 00:17:25,08
为我们穿军装的小伙子们
On the house, for our boys in uniform.

247
00:17:25,09 --> 00:17:28,09
谢了甜心,这可真爽
Thank you, sugar. That's very kind.

248
00:17:28,67 --> 00:17:30,20
谢Frank把
Thank Frank.

249
00:17:30,21 --> 00:17:31,65
谢了Frank
Thanks, Frank.

250
00:17:32,97 --> 00:17:35,05
放松
Just relax.

251
00:17:35,44 --> 00:17:38,64
这货色我们要注射好几次
You have to boot this shit a couple of times.

252
00:17:39,43 --> 00:17:42,97
条子总断货,卖这种破烂
The cops keep cutting it, selling the shit.

253
00:17:44,82 --> 00:17:47,65
我不会抱怨什么因为价钱公道
I don't want to say anything, 'cause the price is right,

254
00:17:48,38 --> 00:17:56,47
可是越南的货可比这强的太多,太多了
but that shit in Nam is way,

255
00:17:52,63 --> 00:17:56,26
way heavy.

256
00:18:19,67 --> 00:18:21,89
你没看到那罐子,Frank ?
Did you ain't seen the jar, Frank?

257
00:18:22,99 --> 00:18:24,81
我认为是你错过了它
I think you walked right past it.

258
00:18:26,08 --> 00:18:29,28
钱罐,明白么?我还能怎么做,在上面贴个他妈的标签?
The money jar, Frank. What do I gotta do, put a fucking sign on it?

259
00:18:30,34 --> 00:18:31,43
Hmm?

260
00:18:34,55 --> 00:18:35,49
看看这老黑
Look at this nigger right here. You know, Frank,

261
00:18:35,50 --> 00:18:39,11
Frank,你很清楚Bumpy不再掌管116街了
Bumpy don't own 116th no more.

262
00:18:39,12 --> 00:18:41,07
Bumpy在哈林区也没有任何房地产了
Bumpy don't own no real estate in Harlem right now.

263
00:18:41,08 --> 00:18:43,61
现在地主是我,房租是百分之二十
I'm the landlord and the lease is 20%.

264
00:18:45,35 --> 00:18:47,89
不过别在那里贩毒Frank
Look, don't sell dope then, Frank. Get a real job.

265
00:18:47,90 --> 00:18:50,29
找份真正的工作,你需要工作么,Frank?
You need a fucking job, Frank? Hmm? Is that what you need?

266
00:18:50,82 --> 00:18:52,17
需要么?
Well, you can come work for me.

267
00:18:52,18 --> 00:18:53,53
来跟我干吧

268
00:18:53,54 --> 00:18:54,84
你可以给我开开车到处转
Okay? You can drive me around, huh? You can open my doors.

269
00:18:54,85 --> 00:18:56,53
替我开门

270
00:18:56,83 --> 00:18:58,20
是,先生.不,先生
Huh? "Yes, sir", "No, sir", "Right away, sir", "Anything you want, Massa Johnson".

271
00:18:58,21 --> 00:18:59,36
马上,先生

272
00:18:59,37 --> 00:19:01,34
出什么事了? Johnson主人?

273
00:19:04,11 --> 00:19:05,88
百分之二十
Twenty percent.

274
00:19:12,76 --> 00:19:15,37
Tango, 百分之二十的租金就抵得上我的利润了
Twenty percent is my profit, Tango.

275
00:19:17,35 --> 00:19:19,10
要是我给了你那我还剩什么了,什么都不剩,不是么?
If I give you that, then what do I got left? Nothing, man.

276
00:19:19,11 --> 00:19:23,32
百分之二十会让我失去生意,就像你知道的某些人一样失去生意
Twenty percent puts me out of business,

277
00:19:21,23 --> 00:19:23,36
and every somebody you know out of business.

278
00:19:23,33 --> 00:19:26,44
做事情要有合理的途径,Tango
There's legitimate ways of doing things, Tango, and then there's this way.

279
00:19:26,45 --> 00:19:28,76
就连Bumpy都没收过百分之二十
Not even Bumpy took 20%.

280
00:19:28,77 --> 00:19:30,61
Bumpy已经他妈的翘了
Bumpy's fucking dead.

281
00:19:34,07 --> 00:19:35,90
好伙计
My man.

282
00:19:35,91 --> 00:19:37,71
百分之二十?
Twenty percent?

283
00:19:45,97 --> 00:19:47,82
百分之二十
Twenty percent.

284
00:19:47,83 --> 00:19:50,36
Doc,我们走
Doc, let's go.

285
00:19:51,92 --> 00:19:55,68
在越南,毒品问题比大麻更要严重

286
00:19:55,69 --> 00:19:59,45
此时此刻估计有三分之一的美军士兵

287
00:19:59,46 --> 00:20:02,50
在使用鸦片和海洛因

288
00:20:02,85 --> 00:20:08,71
官方宣称他们没收了大量大麻,海洛因以及麻醉药片

289
00:20:06,54 --> 00:20:09,33
Out: Good job: Sit:

290
00:20:08,72 --> 00:20:14,18
并且将对每个行人和车辆进行严格搜查

291
00:20:11,04 --> 00:20:14,84
A leader, like a shepherd,

292
00:20:14,19 --> 00:20:19,50
士兵们可以从曼谷,西贡以及越南和泰国其他地区
he sends his fastest nimble sheep, out front:

293
00:20:19,51 --> 00:20:22,28
的当地娱乐场所接触到毒品
And the others will follow.

294
00:20:20,05 --> 00:20:23,47
While the shepherd, he walks quietly behind it.

295
00:20:22,29 --> 00:20:30,24
官方宣称来自西贡和远东的高纯度海洛因便于获取而且价格低廉
Here, boy! Here we go. Right here. Bring it here. Yeah.

296
00:20:27,68 --> 00:20:31,90
Now he's got the stick, and the cane, he'll use it!

297
00:20:30,25 --> 00:20:34,12
从而导致在美军士兵中普遍流行的海洛因上瘾症状

298
00:20:32,65 --> 00:20:34,36
If he has to.

299
00:20:34,48 --> 00:20:36,82
But most times he doesn't have to.

300
00:20:37,97 --> 00:20:38,91
接线员
He moves the whole herd quietly.

301
00:20:38,92 --> 00:20:40,06
国际长途

302
00:20:40,07 --> 00:20:41,17
哪个州?

303
00:20:41,18 --> 00:20:42,47
曼谷

304
00:20:42,48 --> 00:20:43,52
您知道国家代码么
What right do they have cutting out the supplier?

305
00:20:43,53 --> 00:20:44,99
知道,376

306
00:20:45,44 --> 00:20:46,75
前三分钟收费是...

307
00:20:46,76 --> 00:20:48,61
好,我知道
The middleman. Buying direct.

308
00:20:52,67 --> 00:20:55,42
Putting Americans out of work.

309
00:20:54,54 --> 00:20:55,46
你好

310
00:20:55,47 --> 00:20:57,39
伙计,我能帮你点什么
That's the way it is now, Frank.

311
00:20:57,40 --> 00:20:58,90
Nate

312
00:20:58,91 --> 00:20:59,90
我认识你么?

313
00:20:59,91 --> 00:21:01,01
对,是我
That's the way it is.

314
00:21:01,02 --> 00:21:01,82
谁?

315
00:21:01,83 --> 00:21:03,79
我,Frank,你表兄,老黑

316
00:21:08,05 --> 00:21:10,31
这钱你拿着去买套好西服

317
00:21:19,62 --> 00:21:23,25
The drug problem in Vietnam is more than marijuana:

318
00:21:23,37 --> 00:21:26,17
At this point, it is estimated that one third of American troops are experimenting

319
00:21:26,29 --> 00:21:28,17
with opium and heroin:

320
00:21:31,05 --> 00:21:32,13
The authorities say they have confiscated

321
00:21:32,26 --> 00:21:35,76
large quantities of marijuana, heroin and pills:

322
00:21:36,14 --> 00:21:38,97
Every person and every vehicle going through the gates

323
00:21:39,10 --> 00:21:41,31
is subject to a thorough shakedown:

324
00:21:41,47 --> 00:21:45,23
Soldiers have access to the drugs at many rest and relaxation spots

325
00:21:46,63 --> 00:21:47,90
我很抱歉
in Bangkok, Saigon and other areas throughout Vietnam and Thailand:

326
00:21:47,91 --> 00:21:49,82
算了吧Richie

327
00:21:49,83 --> 00:21:52,73
这次实在没办法,我下周末带他好么
Officials say the easy availability, relatively cheap cost

328
00:21:53,74 --> 00:21:55,32
我们要搬家了
and high purity of heroin throughout Saigon and the Far East,

329
00:21:55,33 --> 00:21:57,70
什么?搬到哪儿?

330
00:21:58,79 --> 00:22:00,81
搬到St. Regis酒店,你管得着么
is leading to an epidemic of heroin addiction among US soldiers:

331
00:22:03,70 --> 00:22:05,28
去我妹妹家
-Operator: Yeah, international.

332
00:22:05,29 --> 00:22:07,46
- 你妹妹,在拉斯维加斯? - 对

333
00:22:07,47 --> 00:22:10,97
你不能带着Michael去拉斯维加斯
-What city? -Bangkok.

334
00:22:09,72 --> 00:22:12,47
-You know the country code? -Yeah, 376.

335
00:22:11,27 --> 00:22:14,15
那我能拿他怎么办,把他留给你照顾?
-For the first three minutes, it'll be::: -I got it, I got it. I got it.

336
00:22:14,16 --> 00:22:15,54
后果可想而知

337
00:22:16,09 --> 00:22:18,56
嗨伙计们,冷静

338
00:22:20,43 --> 00:22:24,00
Laurie,拉斯维加斯可不是个抚养孩子的好地方

339
00:22:21,94 --> 00:22:22,94
Hello?

340
00:22:24,01 --> 00:22:25,94
哦,那这儿的环境好?
Soul Brothers: Hey, can I help you?

341
00:22:25,95 --> 00:22:27,41
在你的朋友附近?
Nate.

342
00:22:27,42 --> 00:22:29,29
那我什么时候能看孩子
-Do I know you? -Yeah, it's me.

343
00:22:29,30 --> 00:22:31,89
这周末,上周末
-Who? -Me, Frank. Your cousin, negro.

344
00:22:33,22 --> 00:22:34,83
该死

345
00:22:34,84 --> 00:22:37,47
嗨,我告诉过你们闭嘴,对不?
Go on, get yourself a new suit.

346
00:22:37,48 --> 00:22:40,26
现在我要宰了你们,我发誓我要掏出枪

347
00:22:40,27 --> 00:22:41,94
在你们的狗头上一人来一颗子弹

348
00:22:41,95 --> 00:22:44,25
赶紧把玻璃收拾好滚蛋

349
00:22:44,26 --> 00:22:46,13
冷静点伙计,冷静点

350
00:22:49,39 --> 00:22:51,17
他简直是他妈的疯了

351
00:22:51,96 --> 00:22:53,90
你没有枪

352
00:22:56,59 --> 00:22:58,49
你确定?

353
00:23:06,15 --> 00:23:08,44
你太疯狂了,Richie

354
00:23:12,05 --> 00:23:14,29
而且你无法容纳我们

355
00:23:13,95 --> 00:23:15,12
Look, I'm sorry.

356
00:23:15,95 --> 00:23:18,11
法院见了
Oh, please, Richie.

357
00:23:17,17 --> 00:23:20,75
It couldn't be avoided. I'll take him next weekend, all right?

358
00:23:19,14 --> 00:23:21,03
来把,Michael

359
00:23:21,51 --> 00:23:23,45
跟爸爸再见
We're moving.

360
00:23:22,59 --> 00:23:24,55
What? Where?

361
00:23:24,29 --> 00:23:26,50
嗨小子

362
00:23:26,05 --> 00:23:28,43
The St Regis. What do you care?

363
00:23:28,02 --> 00:23:29,29
下周见,好么?

364
00:23:30,93 --> 00:23:32,39
To my sister's.

365
00:23:32,52 --> 00:23:34,81
-Your sister's? In Vegas? -Yeah.

366
00:23:34,94 --> 00:23:37,40
You are not moving to Las Vegas. Not with Michael, anyway.

367
00:23:38,73 --> 00:23:41,94
What am I supposed to do with him, leave him with you? There's a picture.

368
00:23:43,32 --> 00:23:45,11
Hey, guys! Be cool.

369
00:23:47,66 --> 00:23:51,16
Laurie, Las Vegas is not the kind of place that you raise a kid.

370
00:23:51,29 --> 00:23:54,46
Like this is a good environment? And around your friends?

371
00:23:54,62 --> 00:23:56,42
When am I supposed to see my boy?

372
00:23:56,54 --> 00:23:58,67
This weekend. Last weekend.

373
00:23:59,03 --> 00:24:01,42
你们还有10分钟
God damn it.

374
00:24:01,93 --> 00:24:04,10
10 minutes 10分钟
Hey! I asked you nice to shut up, right?

375
00:24:04,59 --> 00:24:05,68
Now I'm gonna have to kill you.

376
00:24:05,85 --> 00:24:09,06
I swear I will pull out my gun and put a bullet in your fucking heads!

377
00:24:09,18 --> 00:24:11,14
Now stop what you're doing and pick up the glass!

378
00:24:11,31 --> 00:24:13,60
Calm down, man. Okay, be cool.

379
00:24:16,36 --> 00:24:17,82
Fucking crazy, man.

380
00:24:19,28 --> 00:24:20,99
You don't have a gun.

381
00:24:22,22 --> 00:24:26,09
曼谷

382
00:24:23,82 --> 00:24:25,08
You sure?

383
00:24:33,17 --> 00:24:35,00
You are crazy, Richie.

384
00:24:39,30 --> 00:24:41,43
You don't have room for us.

385
00:24:43,18 --> 00:24:45,01
I'll see you in court.

386
00:24:46,72 --> 00:24:48,31
Come on, Michael.

387
00:24:48,69 --> 00:24:50,44
Say bye to your dad.

388
00:24:51,73 --> 00:24:53,77
-Get over here. -Hey, kiddo.

389
00:24:55,23 --> 00:24:58,66
I'll see you next week, all right? We'll do something.

390
00:24:59,49 --> 00:25:01,53
Let's get you an ice cream.

391
00:25:26,39 --> 00:25:30,61
You have 10 minutes remaining. Ten minutes.

392
00:25:40,79 --> 00:25:42,67
他说"很多"

393
00:25:44,10 --> 00:25:45,93
他是你表兄?

394
00:25:47,32 --> 00:25:49,65
对...他是

395
00:25:50,22 --> 00:25:53,02
他是我前妻的表兄

396
00:25:53,44 --> 00:25:55,66
问他到底要多少

397
00:25:57,68 --> 00:25:59,87
你想要多少,Frank?

398
00:26:00,39 --> 00:26:02,92
告诉他我要100公斤

399
00:26:04,73 --> 00:26:07,11
Frank,我认识的人里没有能供这么多货的

400
00:26:07,12 --> 00:26:10,89
你需要从多个货源发掘而且货不会是百分之百纯度

401
00:26:10,90 --> 00:26:13,06
这个那个这个那个,我不想要这些

402
00:26:13,07 --> 00:26:15,70
我知道你不要,可是

403
00:26:15,71 --> 00:26:19,82
要这么多货你需要和九州帮做交易,明白么?

404
00:26:19,83 --> 00:26:20,99
堤岸,西贡

405
00:26:21,00 --> 00:26:22,44
如果他们肯和你交易的话

406
00:26:22,45 --> 00:26:24,99
我理解可是那就太晚了

407
00:26:25,00 --> 00:26:26,13
价格就已经被提上去了

408
00:26:26,14 --> 00:26:27,76
我想从他们拿货的地方拿货

409
00:26:27,77 --> 00:26:28,74
我要去货的源头

410
00:26:28,75 --> 00:26:29,72
你要自己去源头买货?

411
00:26:29,73 --> 00:26:31,11
为什么不呢

412
00:26:33,13 --> 00:26:34,98
我万水千山的赶过来为什么

413
00:26:34,99 --> 00:26:36,52
你是要去那他妈的从林地带?
Shake it, baby. Shake it, shake it, shake it.

414
00:26:36,53 --> 00:26:37,83
我现在就在从林里

415
00:26:37,84 --> 00:26:40,07
你看他们在吃蟑螂还是什么玩艺儿,

416
00:26:40,08 --> 00:26:41,82
黑鬼,我是说蛇,明白么?

417
00:26:41,83 --> 00:26:43,75
我说的是老虎,越共

418
00:26:43,76 --> 00:26:46,37
还有能把你咬死的蚊子
Oh, come on, girl. Don't tell me $5 don't get me a little something.

419
00:26:46,73 --> 00:26:49,49
Can you dig that it costs money to be here?

420
00:26:48,53 --> 00:26:49,79
你要去丛林?
Oh, come on, girl.

421
00:26:49,80 --> 00:26:50,95
我们要去

422
00:26:53,34 --> 00:26:55,08
- 去他妈的,我们去 - 我们要去

423
00:26:55,09 --> 00:26:56,62
- 为什么不 - 我们去

424
00:27:24,90 --> 00:27:26,95
How much you want, Frank?

425
00:27:27,70 --> 00:27:29,66
Tell him I want 100 keys.

426
00:27:31,83 --> 00:27:34,54
Frank, ain't nobody I know can get you that much personally, all right?

427
00:27:34,71 --> 00:27:36,54
You're gonna have to piece it together from several sources,

428
00:27:36,67 --> 00:27:38,17
and it's not gonna be 100% pure.

429
00:27:38,78 --> 00:27:40,65
告诉你,Frank
I don't want that.

430
00:27:41,25 --> 00:27:44,64
这地方是被国民党封锁
I know what you don't want, Frank,

431
00:27:42,38 --> 00:27:47,01
but look, what you're gonna need is to get to the Chiu-Chou syndicate, all right?

432
00:27:45,89 --> 00:27:48,59
蒋介石将军的残部
Cholon, Saigon. If they're gonna deal with you at all.

433
00:27:49,76 --> 00:27:52,06
I understand that, but by then it's gonna be too late.

434
00:27:52,18 --> 00:27:54,73
It'll be already chopped up. I wanna go get it where they go get it from.

435
00:27:54,90 --> 00:27:55,90
I wanna go to the source.

436
00:27:56,06 --> 00:27:59,15
-So, you're gonna go get it yourself? -Why not?

437
00:27:59,32 --> 00:28:01,61
Huh? I came this far.

438
00:28:02,40 --> 00:28:03,82
You're gonna go into the motherfucking jungle?

439
00:28:03,95 --> 00:28:05,28
I'm in the jungle. Look around.

440
00:28:05,41 --> 00:28:07,20
They're eating these roaches and whatever that is.

441
00:28:07,33 --> 00:28:08,99
Nigga, I'm talking about snakes, all right?

442
00:28:09,12 --> 00:28:10,83
I'm talking about tigers, I'm talking about Vietcong,

443
00:28:11,00 --> 00:28:14,67
I'm talking about mosquitoes that'll fucking kill your ass.

444
00:28:15,79 --> 00:28:16,96
You wanna go into the jungle?

445
00:28:17,09 --> 00:28:18,71
We're going.

446
00:28:20,72 --> 00:28:21,97
-Fuck it. Let's go. -We're going.

447
00:28:22,13 --> 00:28:23,13
Why not? Let's go.

448
00:28:27,08 --> 00:28:28,98
你怎么把货运回美国?

449
00:28:29,35 --> 00:28:31,50
这你不用担心

450
00:28:31,51 --> 00:28:32,78
你在那里替谁干?

451
00:28:32,79 --> 00:28:34,29
这你也不用担心

452
00:28:34,81 --> 00:28:36,97
你到底是谁?

453
00:28:37,67 --> 00:28:39,88
Frank Lucas,那该死的护照上写着呢

454
00:28:39,89 --> 00:28:41,91
我是说谁是你老大

455
00:28:41,92 --> 00:28:43,71
我自己

456
00:28:45,01 --> 00:28:50,51
你认为你能在没有任何一个老大罩着你的情况下把100公斤海洛因运进美国?

457
00:28:50,52 --> 00:28:52,63
会有人让你这么干?

458
00:28:53,06 --> 00:28:55,01
说对了

459
00:28:55,25 --> 00:28:57,33
他一定是疯了

460
00:29:01,55 --> 00:29:03,90
这第一笔买卖后

461
00:29:04,21 --> 00:29:11,31
要是你没被马赛的毒贩子或他们在美国的人干掉的话

462
00:29:06,31 --> 00:29:07,94
Hey, Frank.

463
00:29:08,48 --> 00:29:11,56
This whole spot's locked down by the Kuomintang,

464
00:29:12,03 --> 00:29:13,11
接下来会怎么样
General Chiang Kai-shek's defeated army.

465
00:29:13,12 --> 00:29:16,09
接下来我会要更多的,更多的货,我保证

466
00:29:16,79 --> 00:29:20,95
要是你和谁交易都无所谓的话,我可不想来这一个一个的把他们打倒

467
00:29:21,55 --> 00:29:23,58
当然不会

468
00:29:25,91 --> 00:29:27,58
好哥们

469
00:29:28,07 --> 00:29:29,16
够意思

470
00:29:29,17 --> 00:29:31,08
够意思

471
00:29:54,36 --> 00:29:56,74
How would you get it into the States?

472
00:29:56,87 --> 00:29:58,66
You ain't got to worry about that.

473
00:29:58,78 --> 00:29:59,87
Who do you work for in there?

474
00:30:00,04 --> 00:30:02,58
You ain't got to worry about that, either.

475
00:30:02,71 --> 00:30:04,50
Who are you, really?

476
00:30:05,08 --> 00:30:07,21
Frank Lucas, says it right there in my passport.

477
00:30:07,38 --> 00:30:09,05
I mean, who you represent?

478
00:30:09,17 --> 00:30:10,17
Me.

479
00:30:12,32 --> 00:30:16,76
五万,足够买通他们和飞行员以及那头接货的伙计
You think you're going to take 100 kilos of heroin into the US,

480
00:30:17,72 --> 00:30:19,31
给他们十万
and you don't work for anyone? Someone is going to allow that?

481
00:30:20,04 --> 00:30:21,93
五万就够了,Frank
That's right.

482
00:30:21,94 --> 00:30:24,02
给他们十万,全都给他们

483
00:30:25,00 --> 00:30:28,49
听着,这些是我全部家当

484
00:30:28,50 --> 00:30:31,19
所以无论如何货都要送到
After this first purchase, if you are not killed by Marseille importers,

485
00:30:34,36 --> 00:30:38,83
听好,表兄不表兄的不说,我是个忙人
or their people in the States, then what?

486
00:30:38,84 --> 00:30:41,23
我可没工夫去参加任何人的葬礼

487
00:30:40,37 --> 00:30:43,88
Then there will be more, much more, I guarantee it.

488
00:30:42,68 --> 00:30:44,61
货到了我会通知你
And if it's all the same to you,

489
00:30:45,49 --> 00:30:47,25
好伙计
I don't wanna have to drag my ass up here no more.

490
00:30:48,84 --> 00:30:50,38
Of course not.

491
00:30:53,22 --> 00:30:54,39
My man.

492
00:30:55,26 --> 00:30:57,14
-Soul brother, huh? -Soul brother.

493
00:31:10,37 --> 00:31:11,55
- Richie? - 是我

494
00:31:11,56 --> 00:31:12,96
这家伙把我耍了

495
00:31:12,97 --> 00:31:14,93
我不知道他怎么做到的但是他做到了

496
00:31:15,48 --> 00:31:16,99
他去拿枪

497
00:31:17,00 --> 00:31:18,59
我不得不下手

498
00:31:18,60 --> 00:31:20,54
外面有一百多个人听到了枪声

499
00:31:20,55 --> 00:31:22,70
你得帮帮我

500
00:31:24,72 --> 00:31:26,07
J,你在哪儿?

501
00:31:27,08 --> 00:31:28,63
这就是难题所在

502
00:31:31,97 --> 00:31:35,26
警官,我需要增援,我需要增援 (请查十数码"ten-code")

503
00:31:35,66 --> 00:31:37,34
收到,你现在的位置在哪里?

504
00:31:37,99 --> 00:31:39,55
在2号塔

505
00:31:41,05 --> 00:31:45,51
从1G向Projects方向
Fifty grand. It's gonna cover them and the pilot and the boys on the other end.

506
00:31:45,52 --> 00:31:46,94
请说明你的身份
Give them a hundred.

507
00:31:46,95 --> 00:31:48,44
Richie Roberts警探
Fifty is gonna cover it, Frank.

508
00:31:48,45 --> 00:31:51,07
不行,那地区没有警员
Give them a hundred, give them the whole thing. Here.

509
00:31:51,08 --> 00:31:52,55
扯淡!
And look,

510
00:31:52,70 --> 00:31:55,32
请再呼叫,我需要增援

511
00:31:55,33 --> 00:31:57,77
Roberts警探,那儿附近没有警员
that's all I got. So, if that dope don't arrive for any reason...

512
00:31:57,78 --> 00:31:59,07
我无能为力

513
00:32:02,09 --> 00:32:06,09
Hey, listen, cousin or no cousin, I'm a busy man, all right?

514
00:32:06,22 --> 00:32:09,47
I ain't got no time to be going to nobody's funeral.

515
00:32:09,93 --> 00:32:12,56
I'll let you know when it's in the air.

516
00:32:12,68 --> 00:32:13,77
My man.

517
00:32:26,46 --> 00:32:28,72
你要怎么办,混帐!
Fuck.

518
00:32:28,95 --> 00:32:31,40
嗨,冷静

519
00:32:31,41 --> 00:32:33,01
- 你想怎么做,我才不管你是谁 - 冷静点好么

520
00:32:33,02 --> 00:32:34,80
我会查出里面究竟怎么了

521
00:32:37,63 --> 00:32:38,71
Richie? -Yeah.

522
00:32:38,84 --> 00:32:40,01
This fucking guy made me:

523
00:32:40,13 --> 00:32:42,51
I don't know how he did, but he did.

524
00:32:42,63 --> 00:32:43,89
He went for his gun:

525
00:32:44,39 --> 00:32:45,88
Richie
I had to do it, man.

526
00:32:45,85 --> 00:32:47,72
There's 100 people out there that heard the shots.

527
00:32:47,85 --> 00:32:49,98
You gotta help me. You gotta do something.

528
00:32:50,14 --> 00:32:51,81
Baby.

529
00:32:52,11 --> 00:32:53,90
把门打开!
Where are you, Jay?

530
00:32:53,91 --> 00:32:55,44
你的增援呢?
That's the problem.

531
00:32:56,74 --> 00:32:58,22
你没找到人增援?

532
00:32:58,23 --> 00:32:59,79
为什么?
Dispatch, I got a 10-13. I got a 10-13.

533
00:33:02,67 --> 00:33:04,02
把他的脖子用绷带缠好
Copy that: What's your 20?

534
00:33:04,03 --> 00:33:05,39
Richie,他已经死了
Tower two.

535
00:33:05,40 --> 00:33:08,55
我他妈知道他已经死了,缠上绷带,清理他的脑袋

536
00:33:08,56 --> 00:33:10,11
把他在医疗床上弄成坐着的样子
Apartment 1G.

537
00:33:10,12 --> 00:33:12,00
- 睁开他的眼睛 - 开门!
Kent and West in the projects.

538
00:33:12,01 --> 00:33:13,43
都好了么? 我们走
Identify yourself, please:

539
00:33:13,44 --> 00:33:14,95
操
Detective Richie Roberts.

540
00:33:15,50 --> 00:33:18,43
That's a negative: I got no units in that area:

541
00:33:18,40 --> 00:33:20,26
好,把这儿情理干净
Bullshit.

542
00:33:20,09 --> 00:33:22,64
Please put the call out again. I'm gonna need assistance.

543
00:33:22,80 --> 00:33:24,85
Detective Roberts, I got no units in that area:

544
00:33:25,03 --> 00:33:26,54
嗨
-Fuck you. -That's a negative:

545
00:33:28,25 --> 00:33:30,69
该死的快开门

546
00:33:31,45 --> 00:33:32,53
- 把你的枪给我 - 什么?

547
00:33:32,54 --> 00:33:33,98
把你的枪给我

548
00:33:37,17 --> 00:33:38,43
你的警徽带了么
I didn't mention no cops. Know what I'm saying?

549
00:33:38,44 --> 00:33:39,70
带了
You know what I'm saying?

550
00:33:41,14 --> 00:33:44,43
你们都准备好了? OK,尽管往前走
I'll get the motherfucker! Kick his ass!

551
00:33:42,45 --> 00:33:45,20
Yo, cracker, you gonna pay for this shit!

552
00:33:45,37 --> 00:33:46,04
你没事吧

553
00:33:46,05 --> 00:33:47,53
我没事

554
00:33:49,01 --> 00:33:50,66
没有问题,没有问题
Where the fuck you going? Where the fuck you going?

555
00:33:50,67 --> 00:33:52,16
退后退后

556
00:33:53,88 --> 00:33:55,93
What you gonna do, motherfucker?

557
00:33:57,19 --> 00:33:59,46
他没事,我们会照顾好她
Hey, hey, be cool. Be cool, all right?

558
00:33:59,96 --> 00:34:01,64
退后退后
I'll find out what's going on in here.

559
00:34:01,65 --> 00:34:03,44
他没事,他没事

560
00:34:10,83 --> 00:34:12,52
他还活着
Richie.

561
00:34:18,28 --> 00:34:19,28
Open the door!

562
00:34:19,45 --> 00:34:21,08
Open the motherfucking door!

563
00:34:21,25 --> 00:34:22,41
Where's your backup?

564
00:34:22,80 --> 00:34:24,54
多谢了
You motherfucking cracker!

565
00:34:24,00 --> 00:34:26,46
You got no backup? Why is that?

566
00:34:25,53 --> 00:34:28,73
我操,那混蛋拿着把手枪指着我
You gotta come out sometime, motherfucker!

567
00:34:28,74 --> 00:34:30,24
你能想象么?
Bandage his neck.

568
00:34:30,25 --> 00:34:31,82
用枪指着警察?
Richie, he's dead.

569
00:34:31,83 --> 00:34:32,96
我不得不这么做
I know he's fucking dead, right.

570
00:34:32,97 --> 00:34:34,42
杀了就杀了
Bandage his neck, clean up his head,

571
00:34:35,25 --> 00:34:37,32
反正这是个疯狂的世界,对不?
prop him up on the gurney so he's sitting and open his fucking eyes.

572
00:34:38,43 --> 00:34:39,43
Open this fucking door!

573
00:34:40,25 --> 00:34:41,89
你他妈跑到那地方去干吗?
All right? Let's go.

574
00:34:41,90 --> 00:34:45,33
哦,我是在调查一些事情
Fuck.

575
00:34:45,67 --> 00:34:47,42
就像你教我的那样
All right, clean him up.

576
00:34:47,43 --> 00:34:52,04
调查嫌疑人,追踪蛛丝马迹并整理出头绪
Okay. Where's the solution?

577
00:34:52,64 --> 00:34:55,86
那家伙是个毒贩子,是个人渣
Hey. -Huh?

578
00:34:55,20 --> 00:34:57,33
God damn it, open this fucking door!

579
00:34:57,28 --> 00:34:59,93
J,那家伙没有把枪对准一个警察
-Give me your gun. -What?

580
00:35:00,24 --> 00:35:02,57
他是把枪对准了一个垃圾
Give me your gun.

581
00:35:01,29 --> 00:35:04,04
Get your punk ass out here, man!

582
00:35:02,87 --> 00:35:04,65
一个试图抢劫他的垃圾
-You have your badge? -Yeah.

583
00:35:04,66 --> 00:35:06,04
你他妈说什么呢?

584
00:35:07,85 --> 00:35:09,79
我操,你在干什么
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch!

585
00:35:09,80 --> 00:35:10,50
这他妈是什么?
-You guys ready? -Uh-huh.

586
00:35:10,51 --> 00:35:12,10
这是我的钱!
Okay. Just keep moving forward.

587
00:35:12,11 --> 00:35:14,04
是我挣的,是我的
-You all right? -Yeah.

588
00:35:14,05 --> 00:35:15,49
是我做一名好警员挣来的

589
00:35:15,50 --> 00:35:16,30
这他妈是什么?
It's okay! It's okay!

590
00:35:16,31 --> 00:35:17,70
这是我做好警察挣来的

591
00:35:17,71 --> 00:35:20,85
- 你谋杀了那个人,你谋杀了那个家伙 - 我不想被他用枪打死
We're taking him to the hospital.

592
00:35:19,98 --> 00:35:22,81
Everybody, step back! Step back!

593
00:35:21,77 --> 00:35:25,27
你谋杀了他,抢了他的钱然后给我打电话要我把你从那儿弄出来

594
00:35:25,28 --> 00:35:27,08
所以我们才差点死在那儿,你这混蛋?
He's all right.

595
00:35:25,40 --> 00:35:27,36
He's okay. We're taking care of him.

596
00:35:27,09 --> 00:35:31,23
我会告诉你怎么做,你只需要像我说的那样写报告
Step back. Step back.

597
00:35:31,79 --> 00:35:35,49
然后事情就会如我们所愿
Everything's fine. Just stand back.

598
00:35:34,16 --> 00:35:35,33
He's all right.

599
00:35:36,33 --> 00:35:37,91
我不能那么做
He's alive.

600
00:35:38,73 --> 00:35:42,62
所有人都对我唯恐避之不及就是因为我听了你的话上交了那百万美元
What happened inside?

601
00:35:39,17 --> 00:35:40,88
We're taking him to the hospital.

602
00:35:42,63 --> 00:35:44,91
从那以后没人愿意跟我合作

603
00:35:45,64 --> 00:35:48,01
我可以就此洗手不干,Richie

604
00:35:48,31 --> 00:35:50,02
那很简单

605
00:35:50,32 --> 00:35:53,61
你只需要按我说的写报告
Thanks, man.

606
00:35:53,62 --> 00:35:55,47
看在我们是拍档的份上
Fuck.

607
00:35:54,43 --> 00:35:57,31
That asshole pulled a piece on me, man. Can you fucking believe it?

608
00:35:56,47 --> 00:35:58,32
我不能那么做
He pulls a piece on a cop?

609
00:36:00,16 --> 00:36:01,83
嗨!
I had to do it, man. Kill or be killed.

610
00:36:03,02 --> 00:36:05,18
停车,停车
Fucking crazy world, right?

611
00:36:07,53 --> 00:36:09,16
What the fuck were you doing in the projects?

612
00:36:09,28 --> 00:36:12,79
Investigating stuff, man, you know,

613
00:36:11,01 --> 00:36:12,57
通往华盛顿特区

614
00:36:12,91 --> 00:36:16,17
just like you taught me. Checking on guys,

615
00:36:16,29 --> 00:36:19,71
following things up, putting the pieces together.

616
00:36:19,88 --> 00:36:23,55
That guy was a dealer. A fucking dealer. Scum of the earth.

617
00:36:24,59 --> 00:36:27,43
That guy didn't pull a gun on a cop, Jay.

618
00:36:27,55 --> 00:36:31,64
That guy pulled a gun on a junkie, a junkie who was trying to rob him.

619
00:36:31,77 --> 00:36:33,64
What the fuck you say?

620
00:36:34,98 --> 00:36:36,86
What the fuck, man? What are you doing, man?

621
00:36:36,98 --> 00:36:39,44
-What the fuck is that? -That's my fucking money, man!

622
00:36:39,57 --> 00:36:41,19
I earned this shit. That's mine!

623
00:36:41,32 --> 00:36:42,95
-I earned it doing good cop work! -What the fuck is this?

624
00:36:43,11 --> 00:36:44,74
-What the fuck is that? -I earned it doing good cop work!

625
00:36:44,92 --> 00:36:46,50
打开后备箱
-You murdered a guy! -I earned it getting shot at!

626
00:36:46,62 --> 00:36:48,24
You murdered a guy!

627
00:36:49,00 --> 00:36:52,33
You murdered him, you robbed his money, then you called me to get you out of it.

628
00:36:52,46 --> 00:36:54,33
That makes me an accessory after the fact, motherfucker.

629
00:36:54,46 --> 00:36:58,38
I'll tell you the facts, man. Just write the report the way I say it happened,

630
00:36:58,55 --> 00:37:02,59
and then that's the way it is, and that's how it will be.

631
00:37:03,47 --> 00:37:05,10
I can't do that.

632
00:37:06,01 --> 00:37:09,85
I'm a leper because I listened to you and turned in a million bucks.

633
00:37:10,02 --> 00:37:12,65
No one will work with me after that.

634
00:37:12,77 --> 00:37:16,90
I can get off this shit, Richie. That's easy.

635
00:37:14,87 --> 00:37:20,00
让我们高呼,越战应该结束了

636
00:37:17,40 --> 00:37:22,03
Just write the report between us, as partners.

637
00:37:20,30 --> 00:37:25,11
对于美国来说,最好的办法是现在就准备好离开越南

638
00:37:23,78 --> 00:37:25,33
I can't do that.

639
00:37:27,46 --> 00:37:28,46
Hey!

640
00:37:30,18 --> 00:37:31,81
怎么样
Stop! Stop!

641
00:37:32,79 --> 00:37:33,96
Fuck it.

642
00:37:34,69 --> 00:37:38,27
通常我所见的纯度都是百分之二十五到百分之四十五

643
00:37:38,28 --> 00:37:41,10
这个不含杂质,不含酒精

644
00:37:42,23 --> 00:37:44,22
纯度是百分之百

645
00:37:49,36 --> 00:37:50,48
我可以么?

646
00:37:50,49 --> 00:37:52,02
归你了

647
00:37:53,18 --> 00:37:54,59
谢谢你,Frank

648
00:38:12,25 --> 00:38:13,71
Open the trunk.

649
00:38:28,36 --> 00:38:31,86
Peace now! Peace now! Peace now!

650
00:38:32,03 --> 00:38:35,11
LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?

651
00:38:36,03 --> 00:38:39,12
Get out, get out, get out of Vietnam!

652
00:38:39,29 --> 00:38:42,12
Get out, get out, get out of Vietnam!

653
00:38:42,29 --> 00:38:45,54
:: As loud as we can that the Vietnam War should stop,

654
00:38:45,67 --> 00:38:48,84
and that the best way to stop it is for the United States

655
00:38:49,01 --> 00:38:52,01
to simply pack up and get out of Vietnam right now:

656
00:38:57,64 --> 00:38:59,10
How we looking?

657
00:39:02,14 --> 00:39:05,73
Typically, what I see is 25% to 45% pure.

658
00:39:05,90 --> 00:39:09,49
I mean, there's no adulterants, no alkaloids, no dilutants.

659
00:39:09,86 --> 00:39:11,36
It's 100%.

660
00:39:16,49 --> 00:39:17,58
May I?

661
00:39:17,75 --> 00:39:19,29
Take it with you.

662
00:39:20,21 --> 00:39:21,21
Thank you, Frank.

663
00:39:50,45 --> 00:39:54,93
我要了,不用预备金,没有贷款,什么都不用

664
00:39:55,83 --> 00:39:57,51
我付现金

665
00:39:57,96 --> 00:39:59,61
太好了

666
00:40:04,15 --> 00:40:06,51
我不是在说你的癖好,Richie

667
00:40:06,52 --> 00:40:08,60
那些我都已经再清楚不过了

668
00:40:08,61 --> 00:40:10,41
我是说当警察这事

669
00:40:10,85 --> 00:40:12,68
你是说收黑钱?

670
00:40:13,39 --> 00:40:14,81
我不干那个,从来不做那勾当

671
00:40:14,82 --> 00:40:17,35
那你的朋友和邻居呢,你还和他们来往么?

672
00:40:17,36 --> 00:40:20,05
是的,在周末一起打打棒球

673
00:40:20,06 --> 00:40:22,24
和黑手党成员?这可不怎么好

674
00:40:22,87 --> 00:40:25,11
都是我高中同学,这有什么

675
00:40:25,44 --> 00:40:27,21
那Joseph Sadano呢?

676
00:40:28,82 --> 00:40:30,02
他怎么了?

677
00:40:30,03 --> 00:40:32,60
Richie,我只是想了解你妻子说的事情

678
00:40:32,61 --> 00:40:34,15
那不是真的么?告诉我

679
00:40:34,16 --> 00:40:35,79
对,他是其中一个

680
00:40:35,80 --> 00:40:37,49
他还是你儿子的教父对么?

681
00:40:37,50 --> 00:40:38,64
是的

682
00:40:38,65 --> 00:40:40,29
他肯定和她上床了

683
00:40:40,30 --> 00:40:42,20
你真的很在意这事么?

684
00:40:42,61 --> 00:40:44,75
还是你压根儿就不想赢这场官司

685
00:40:48,67 --> 00:40:52,34
你知道么,二楼有间会客室

686
00:40:52,35 --> 00:40:53,20
我也是这么想的

687
00:40:53,21 --> 00:40:54,66
你可以从里面把门锁上

688
00:40:54,67 --> 00:40:56,54
全体起立

689
00:41:03,47 --> 00:41:06,77
Richie,别像律师,像个警察那样干我

690
00:41:15,79 --> 00:41:17,03
别接,别

691
00:41:18,13 --> 00:41:21,80
I'll take it. No contingencies, no loans, no nothing.

692
00:41:23,15 --> 00:41:24,73
是
Cash.

693
00:41:25,43 --> 00:41:26,89
Fabulous.

694
00:41:31,52 --> 00:41:35,90
I'm not talking about your proclivities, Richie. Those I only know too well.

695
00:41:36,07 --> 00:41:38,11
I'm talking about being a cop.

696
00:41:38,73 --> 00:41:39,61
Richie Roberts
You're talking about taking money?

697
00:41:39,62 --> 00:41:40,91
嗨 Norm
I don't do that. It's not my thing.

698
00:41:43,25 --> 00:41:44,42
你好,我是Richie Roberts
What about your friends from the neighbourhood?

699
00:41:44,43 --> 00:41:45,61
你好,我是Norman Riley警探
-Do you still hang out with them? -Yeah.

700
00:41:45,62 --> 00:41:46,45
嗨Norm,你好么
Play baseball on the weekends.

701
00:41:46,46 --> 00:41:47,92
我很好
Wise guys? That's gonna look good.

702
00:41:47,93 --> 00:41:49,22
是他么?

703
00:41:49,23 --> 00:41:50,81
对
Guys I went to high school with. So what?

704
00:41:52,84 --> 00:41:54,80
What about Joseph Sodano?

705
00:41:56,01 --> 00:41:57,09
What about him?

706
00:41:57,30 --> 00:41:59,97
Richie, I'm just trying to understand things your wife has said.

707
00:42:00,09 --> 00:42:01,43
If they're not true, tell me.

708
00:42:02,04 --> 00:42:03,75
一直都这样
Yeah, he's one of them.

709
00:42:03,76 --> 00:42:05,82
我就算午夜到家也没关系
-Is he also your son's godfather? -Yeah.

710
00:42:06,34 --> 00:42:08,36
我们以前从没见过这东西
He's definitely fucking her.

711
00:42:07,85 --> 00:42:12,15
Do you really care about this? Or do you just not want her to win ever?

712
00:42:13,07 --> 00:42:15,03
有什么我需要签的么

713
00:42:15,04 --> 00:42:17,03
有,在这儿
You know, there's an interview room on the second floor.

714
00:42:17,04 --> 00:42:20,03
这个我带走了,好么?

715
00:42:20,04 --> 00:42:21,51
好的
-That's what I thought. -The door only locks from the inside.

716
00:42:23,35 --> 00:42:27,72
美国人民的头号公敌
All rise.

717
00:42:27,73 --> 00:42:29,57
是毒品滥用

718
00:42:30,32 --> 00:42:32,56
要彻底打倒这个敌人
Oh, God, Richie. Richie, fuck me like a cop, not a lawyer!

719
00:42:32,57 --> 00:42:37,19
我们有必要发起一场全面的进攻

720
00:42:37,85 --> 00:42:45,90
联邦宣布将致力于在华盛顿,纽约,洛杉矶以及芝加哥组建特别毒品管理局

721
00:42:43,23 --> 00:42:44,85
Don't answer it!

722
00:42:45,91 --> 00:42:49,99
一名得不到支持的警探是做不了什么的

723
00:42:50,78 --> 00:42:51,86
Yeah?

724
00:42:52,40 --> 00:42:54,09
你知道我为什么得不到支持

725
00:42:55,13 --> 00:42:57,17
没关系,你做你该做的就好

726
00:42:58,13 --> 00:43:01,51
世界上最伟大的城市正在变成一条臭下水道

727
00:43:02,37 --> 00:43:05,96
每个人都在偷窃,贩毒

728
00:43:06,99 --> 00:43:09,72
Richie你无事可做的原因是因为你太尽职
-Richie Roberts. -Hey, Norm?

729
00:43:10,48 --> 00:43:13,33
好在你并非这城市里唯一诚实的警察
Hey. Richie Roberts.

730
00:43:11,84 --> 00:43:12,84
Hi. Detective Norman Reily.

731
00:43:14,00 --> 00:43:18,33
华盛顿特别毒品管理局可不是耍把式的
-Hey, Norm. How are you? -Good.

732
00:43:15,47 --> 00:43:17,43
-So, is that him? -Yeah.

733
00:43:18,75 --> 00:43:20,29
他们非常认真

734
00:43:20,30 --> 00:43:22,31
我清楚这一点因为他们要求我们组织人力配合起来

735
00:43:22,32 --> 00:43:24,78
我要你来当头儿

736
00:43:24,79 --> 00:43:26,90
但那是联邦机构,我去向谁汇报,邮局?
Picked a nice night to come out, huh? It's like Grand Central around here.

737
00:43:26,91 --> 00:43:28,38
不,你向我汇报

738
00:43:28,39 --> 00:43:30,54
向我和联邦检察官汇报,没有其他人
It's been like this.

739
00:43:31,24 --> 00:43:35,62
I'm lucky if I get home by midnight. It's like nothing we've seen before.

740
00:43:32,78 --> 00:43:35,07
你从此再也不用来警局

741
00:43:35,08 --> 00:43:36,86
你有自己的办公地

742
00:43:36,87 --> 00:43:41,84
你自己选手下,选那些你确认就算马路边有五分钱他都不去捡的人

743
00:43:40,46 --> 00:43:42,33
Something I gotta sign?

744
00:43:42,50 --> 00:43:44,38
Yeah. It's right here.

745
00:43:44,50 --> 00:43:46,88
I'm taking this with me. I'll register it with Essex County, all right?

746
00:43:47,09 --> 00:43:48,47
All right.

747
00:43:50,76 --> 00:43:56,39
America's public enemy number one in the United States is drug abuse:

748
00:43:57,81 --> 00:43:59,69
In order to fight and defeat this enemy,

749
00:43:59,85 --> 00:44:04,57
it is necessary to wage a new, all-out offensive:

750
00:44:03,55 --> 00:44:06,75
格林斯博罗 北卡罗来纳州
Federal authorities have announced their intention

751
00:44:04,06 --> 00:44:05,80
- Huey - Huey

752
00:44:06,77 --> 00:44:07,82
是,你是谁?
to establish special narcotics bureaus

753
00:44:07,83 --> 00:44:09,51
你说我是谁

754
00:44:09,52 --> 00:44:10,33
Frank
in Washington, New York, Los ngeles, Chicago:::

755
00:44:10,34 --> 00:44:11,52
哪个Frank?

756
00:44:11,53 --> 00:44:13,61
你哥Frank

757
00:44:13,62 --> 00:44:14,76
Frank?
A detective without the support of his fellow detectives

758
00:44:17,24 --> 00:44:18,12
是我
really can't do much.

759
00:44:18,13 --> 00:44:19,15
嗨,妈!

760
00:44:19,16 --> 00:44:20,84
- Melvin,妈妈在哪儿? - 什么?
You know why I don't have it.

761
00:44:20,85 --> 00:44:23,03
Frank在电话上

762
00:44:23,04 --> 00:44:24,54
- 嗨,妈 - 你好么Frank?
Doesn't matter. You did what you had to do.

763
00:44:24,55 --> 00:44:26,29
Frank在电话上
Greatest city in the world! And it's turning into an open sewer.

764
00:44:26,67 --> 00:44:27,70
什么?

765
00:44:27,71 --> 00:44:29,17
妈妈,Frank在电话上

766
00:44:29,18 --> 00:44:30,96
等着,我的天啊
Everybody's stealing, dealing.

767
00:44:30,97 --> 00:44:32,82
好的,告诉我什么时候

768
00:44:32,83 --> 00:44:37,21
我六点钟会给你们打电话,我要你把所有人都叫齐,好么

769
00:44:34,39 --> 00:44:37,73
Look at you. You can't work because you did your job.

770
00:44:37,22 --> 00:44:39,20
叫上妈妈和所有的人
Good news is, you're not the only honest cop in town.

771
00:44:39,21 --> 00:44:40,28
OK

772
00:44:41,40 --> 00:44:46,11
The special narcotics bureau in Washington is not a dog and pony show.

773
00:44:46,24 --> 00:44:49,58
They are sincere. I know this because they want us to orchestrate it.

774
00:44:49,74 --> 00:44:52,20
And I want you to head up things here on our end.

775
00:44:52,61 --> 00:44:54,29
已售出
If it's federal, who do I answer to, the post office?

776
00:44:54,37 --> 00:44:55,71
No, you answer to me,

777
00:44:56,08 --> 00:44:57,47
嗨,Frank
me and the US Attorney, nobody else.

778
00:44:59,76 --> 00:45:01,42
You never step foot in a police station again.

779
00:45:04,30 --> 00:45:06,76
You work out of your own place, you pick your own guys,

780
00:45:06,76 --> 00:45:08,79
我的天啊
guys that you know would not take a nickel off the sidewalk.

781
00:45:08,80 --> 00:45:10,84
我真高兴见到你

782
00:45:10,85 --> 00:45:16,04
你这块地真不错啊

783
00:45:17,20 --> 00:45:18,50
我还在想...

784
00:45:18,51 --> 00:45:19,95
这是谁的房子啊,Frank?

785
00:45:19,96 --> 00:45:22,04
那是你的房子,妈妈

786
00:45:22,57 --> 00:45:24,36
- 我的? - 是你的

787
00:45:25,18 --> 00:45:26,88
还有谁?

788
00:45:28,29 --> 00:45:30,51
那就是我的房间

789
00:45:32,92 --> 00:45:36,25
Well, we got the lovely transit.

790
00:45:37,98 --> 00:45:40,80
还有人要吃冰淇淋么
600-year-old mahogany doors.

791
00:45:41,92 --> 00:45:49,76
听我说,我要告诉你们我有多么高兴 看到我所有的儿孙共聚一堂

792
00:45:43,93 --> 00:45:47,10
Now, look at that. Can't you just feel it?

793
00:45:47,81 --> 00:45:49,89
I think it's lovely.

794
00:45:50,51 --> 00:45:51,91
我太高兴了
Watch your step.

795
00:45:54,31 --> 00:45:56,57
小伙子你可真够能吃的

796
00:45:56,58 --> 00:45:58,68
这孩子,他是个运动健将
Look at these beautiful floors.

797
00:45:58,69 --> 00:46:00,81
凭他的手臂完全可以去职业大联盟打棒球
At least, I don't know, 200 years old. And it's hard to get the cracks...

798
00:46:00,82 --> 00:46:01,60
哦是么?

799
00:46:01,61 --> 00:46:02,83
对不对?
Now this was one of my favourite rooms but we had some problems with the plumbing.

800
00:46:03,27 --> 00:46:04,60
是的,爸爸

801
00:46:04,61 --> 00:46:06,55
那吃完晚饭后咱们出去练练怎么样

802
00:46:06,56 --> 00:46:08,59
不不不,你可抓不住他
I even fixed it. I know it works. It's not gonna leak.

803
00:46:08,60 --> 00:46:11,81
这小子可是真的很有天赋

804
00:46:12,08 --> 00:46:14,82
他的速度有每小时95英里

805
00:46:14,83 --> 00:46:15,93
你能追上他么
Here it is.

806
00:46:15,94 --> 00:46:18,76
他不可能追得上

807
00:46:18,77 --> 00:46:23,17
我五岁的时候和他玩抓人的游戏他都追不上我

808
00:46:22,85 --> 00:46:25,31
You know, I used to be a really good piano player when I was a kid,

809
00:46:26,71 --> 00:46:28,38
这是您的房间
but then, I don't know why I forgot.

810
00:46:30,14 --> 00:46:34,13
哦,这真是...
Life goes on. Well...

811
00:46:33,53 --> 00:46:36,28
How long are you gonna be?

812
00:46:36,80 --> 00:46:40,55
太美了,这太漂亮了
Oh, and do me a favour, please. Mind the doors.

813
00:46:40,62 --> 00:46:44,29
Those are beautiful, ornate glass doors, you know.

814
00:46:48,21 --> 00:46:49,76
你怎么...

815
00:46:49,77 --> 00:46:51,86
我凭记忆

816
00:46:53,07 --> 00:46:54,50
让人做的
Here we go, Jimmy. Come on.

817
00:46:54,51 --> 00:46:56,06
他们拿走它的时候你才5岁
Oh, yeah. Give it back.

818
00:46:56,07 --> 00:46:57,59
- 是的 - 你怎么会记得

819
00:46:57,60 --> 00:46:59,67
我怎么会忘记,妈妈

820
00:47:00,60 --> 00:47:01,60
Huey's.

821
00:47:01,77 --> 00:47:02,85
Huey: What up, boy?

822
00:47:03,02 --> 00:47:04,10
Yeah, who this?

823
00:47:04,64 --> 00:47:08,52
真的太完美了
Who you think it is, boy?

824
00:47:05,85 --> 00:47:07,57
-Frank: -Frank who?

825
00:47:08,53 --> 00:47:10,40
全都太完美了
-Frank your brother, negro: -Frank?

826
00:47:13,36 --> 00:47:14,36
That's right.

827
00:47:15,95 --> 00:47:18,61
我太爱你了
Hey, Melvin! Melvin, where's Ma?

828
00:47:16,66 --> 00:47:19,20
-What? -Frank's on the phone!

829
00:47:18,62 --> 00:47:19,55
我也爱你,妈妈
Hey, Ma! -How are you doing, Frankie?

830
00:47:19,56 --> 00:47:21,26
太爱你
Frank's on the phone!

831
00:47:21,27 --> 00:47:22,80
别客气

832
00:47:23,38 --> 00:47:25,42
-Say what? -Mama, Frank's on the phone!

833
00:47:25,54 --> 00:47:27,25
Frank? Oh, my Lord!

834
00:47:27,38 --> 00:47:29,55
Yeah, when? Well, you just say it, man, yeah.

835
00:47:30,86 --> 00:47:34,66
这两个伙计都精通各种装备,他们有可靠的线人
Listen, I'm gonna call y'all back

836
00:47:31,13 --> 00:47:33,39
at 6:00. I want you to get everybody together, all right?

837
00:47:34,67 --> 00:47:37,79
他们诚实且无惧
Get Mama, get everybody.

838
00:47:34,64 --> 00:47:36,35
-All right? -Okay.

839
00:47:37,80 --> 00:47:40,07
而且他们都和你一样疯狂,Richie

840
00:47:40,93 --> 00:47:42,52
他们是谁

841
00:47:45,27 --> 00:47:47,60
那个和瘦瘦的金发白人女孩跳舞的是Jones

842
00:47:48,13 --> 00:47:49,87
我见过的实战最棒的

843
00:47:49,88 --> 00:47:53,21
对毒品了如指掌

844
00:47:53,55 --> 00:47:55,73
他很棒,各方面都不错
Hey, Frank!

845
00:47:53,70 --> 00:47:54,95
What's happening, Frank?

846
00:47:56,06 --> 00:47:59,27
那个和两个肥黑妞跳舞的是Abruzzo
-Hey, Frankie. -How you doing, Uncle Frank?

847
00:47:57,75 --> 00:48:00,62
Get out the car. Get the kids, get the kids.

848
00:47:59,95 --> 00:48:02,83
他就喜欢大屁股的

849
00:48:01,54 --> 00:48:03,09
Look at this, baby.

850
00:48:03,63 --> 00:48:05,75
他可是个猛男
Oh, my Lord! I'm so glad to see you, boy.

851
00:48:06,15 --> 00:48:07,17
从不把事情搞砸
Oh, I'm telling you, this is some piece of land you got here!

852
00:48:07,18 --> 00:48:08,73
他虽说脾气不怎么地

853
00:48:09,07 --> 00:48:11,18
但是非常可靠

854
00:48:11,66 --> 00:48:16,04
听我说,我们从来都一起干,你要我就得要他们

855
00:48:13,31 --> 00:48:14,68
I wonder what the poor people are doing here?

856
00:48:14,81 --> 00:48:16,14
And whose house is that, Frankie?

857
00:48:16,27 --> 00:48:18,44
That is your house, Mama.

858
00:48:19,02 --> 00:48:21,19
-Mine? -That's yours.

859
00:48:22,07 --> 00:48:23,69
And who else?

860
00:48:25,07 --> 00:48:28,82
Now, there, that's my room right there, man. Right over there.

861
00:48:28,64 --> 00:48:30,13
我们什么时候开始?

862
00:48:32,77 --> 00:48:34,28
我的老板

863
00:48:34,29 --> 00:48:38,25
经营着全纽约市最大的公司已经有15年了
Anybody want some more collard greens?

864
00:48:38,79 --> 00:48:42,59
15年8个月零9天
I wanna tell you how happy I am to see all my children at the table

865
00:48:42,60 --> 00:48:44,90
我每天都和他一起工作,我为他工作,保护他
and the grandchildren at the same time.

866
00:48:44,91 --> 00:48:47,22
照顾他,跟他学习

867
00:48:46,55 --> 00:48:48,30
My heart's so happy.

868
00:48:48,66 --> 00:48:52,29
Bumpy有钱,但那都是白人的钱,所以他并不富有
-Enjoy yourselves. -Right on, Grandma.

869
00:48:50,64 --> 00:48:52,98
I hope you got a job, boy, the way you're eating over here.

870
00:48:53,03 --> 00:48:56,43
公司不是他自己的,他以为是但实际上不是,他只是在管理公司
That boy right there, he got a arm on him. I mean, a major league arm.

871
00:48:56,93 --> 00:48:58,96
公司是白人的所以他也归白人掌管
Oh, yeah?

872
00:48:59,41 --> 00:49:00,86
不过我不归任何人管
Ain't that right?

873
00:49:01,11 --> 00:49:02,55
你好啊宝贝儿
Right on, Pop.

874
00:49:00,94 --> 00:49:03,32
Well, we'll see after dinner. We'll see him throw it around a little bit.

875
00:49:03,00 --> 00:49:07,80
那是因为我有自己的公司,我的公司销售的产品比其他竞争对手的都好
No, no, you can't catch him, man.

876
00:49:05,36 --> 00:49:06,70
I'm talking about... I'm talking about...

877
00:49:06,82 --> 00:49:08,53
This guy throw harder than Gibson.

878
00:49:09,06 --> 00:49:11,73
价格比其他竞争者的低廉
We're talking 95 miles an hour.

879
00:49:11,29 --> 00:49:13,25
-Can you catch him? -He gonna...

880
00:49:12,98 --> 00:49:14,79
Frank,我们销售什么?
He gonna catch the ground.

881
00:49:15,00 --> 00:49:17,71
We might've played catch, I think, when I was about five years old.

882
00:49:17,84 --> 00:49:20,63
Since then, he ain't been able to keep up.

883
00:49:23,18 --> 00:49:25,64
-This is your room. -It's perfect.

884
00:49:26,64 --> 00:49:28,56
Oh. Why, it's...

885
00:49:29,89 --> 00:49:31,48
你好,Red
Will you look at this?

886
00:49:32,37 --> 00:49:35,30
这些是我的兄弟,刚从北卡来. 各位,这位是Redtop
Oh!

887
00:49:33,35 --> 00:49:36,52
It's beautiful. It's beautiful. It's just...

888
00:49:35,31 --> 00:49:36,70
- 你好 - 你好啊

889
00:49:36,93 --> 00:49:38,54
还有这些女士
I...

890
00:49:39,49 --> 00:49:41,97
怎么了,你们这些老黑以前没见过小妞么

891
00:49:42,79 --> 00:49:43,89
她们怎么都光着身子

892
00:49:43,90 --> 00:49:45,52
这样她们就不能偷窃
How did you...

893
00:49:46,33 --> 00:49:47,74
I had it made.

894
00:49:48,27 --> 00:49:50,78
做生意最重要的是诚实
From memory.

895
00:49:51,46 --> 00:49:53,43
守信,辛勤工作
You were five when they took it away on me.

896
00:49:52,67 --> 00:49:54,42
-That's right. -How could you remember it?

897
00:49:54,21 --> 00:49:55,69
还有家庭
How could I forget, Mama?

898
00:49:56,36 --> 00:49:58,63
永远不要忘记我们从哪儿来

899
00:49:58,64 --> 00:50:00,23
谢谢

900
00:50:00,84 --> 00:50:04,35
I'll just tell you it is perfect.

901
00:50:05,26 --> 00:50:07,47
你就是你
It's all perfect.

902
00:50:08,59 --> 00:50:10,75
你只会成为两种人之一

903
00:50:12,12 --> 00:50:15,66
无名小卒或风云人物
I can't tell you how much I love you.

904
00:50:15,67 --> 00:50:17,18
我很快回来
I love you, too, Mama.

905
00:50:17,45 --> 00:50:18,57
It's okay.

906
00:50:27,37 --> 00:50:31,17
Both these guys, good with wires, they got solid informants,

907
00:50:31,29 --> 00:50:34,17
and they're honest and they're fearless.

908
00:50:33,33 --> 00:50:34,34
我要新鲜的
They're insane, Richie, like you.

909
00:50:34,35 --> 00:50:36,62
要是坏了可别怪我回来找你麻烦

910
00:50:36,63 --> 00:50:38,31
- Tango - 是的先生,我知道了
Where are they?

911
00:50:38,32 --> 00:50:40,58
您放心,一定没问题

912
00:50:40,59 --> 00:50:42,28
是您么,Frank,您需要点什么?
That's Jones with the skinny white broad.

913
00:50:42,29 --> 00:50:43,27
我的钱呢?

914
00:50:43,28 --> 00:50:46,15
Redtop把货给了你,你就应该把钱给我
Best I ever seen on the street.

915
00:50:46,16 --> 00:50:48,11
罐子就在这儿,百分之二十
He knows dope, but he's together, all right?

916
00:50:48,12 --> 00:50:49,76
- 哦你有罐子了? - 对

917
00:50:51,50 --> 00:50:52,41
滚蛋把,Frank
He's a stand-up guy all round.

918
00:50:52,42 --> 00:50:54,19
你要干吗?
And that's Abruzzo with the two fat black ones.

919
00:50:54,20 --> 00:50:56,05
你他妈想怎么的,Frank

920
00:50:56,51 --> 00:50:57,52
你想干吗
He loves a big ass, man.

921
00:50:57,53 --> 00:50:59,85
你要在大厅广众之下崩了我?

922
00:50:59,86 --> 00:51:01,40
来啊
He's a bulldog. He don't fuck around, all right. He's got a bit of a temper,

923
00:51:03,65 --> 00:51:05,18
我操
yeah, but you can trust this guy with your grandmother.

924
00:51:08,25 --> 00:51:12,59
Listen, Richie. We work together. You want me, you gotta take them, too.

925
00:51:16,95 --> 00:51:20,26
拿着,百分之二十

926
00:51:24,98 --> 00:51:25,98
When do we start?

927
00:51:29,32 --> 00:51:30,49
The man I worked for,

928
00:51:30,65 --> 00:51:32,28
he had one of the biggest companies in New York City.

929
00:51:32,40 --> 00:51:34,74
He ran it for more than 50 years.

930
00:51:35,32 --> 00:51:39,08
Fifteen years, eight months and nine days,

931
00:51:39,20 --> 00:51:40,75
I was with him every day. I worked for him,

932
00:51:40,91 --> 00:51:44,58
I protected him, I looked after him, I learnt from him.

933
00:51:43,47 --> 00:51:45,18
我说到哪儿了?

934
00:51:45,13 --> 00:51:47,75
Bumpy was rich, but he wasn't white man rich, you see?

935
00:51:47,88 --> 00:51:49,34
He wasn't wealthy.

936
00:51:49,46 --> 00:51:51,80
He didn't own his own company. He thought he did, but he didn't,

937
00:51:51,93 --> 00:51:53,51
he just managed it.

938
00:51:53,64 --> 00:51:56,01
The white man owned it, so they owned him.

939
00:51:55,74 --> 00:51:59,54
这就是新组建的缉毒组
-Nobody owns me, though. -Hey.

940
00:51:57,64 --> 00:51:59,56
-How you doing, babe? -Good.

941
00:52:00,31 --> 00:52:04,22
我们的目标是抓大鱼,不是街上的散客
That's 'cause I own my own company, and my company sells a product

942
00:52:02,44 --> 00:52:05,07
that's better than the competition,

943
00:52:04,68 --> 00:52:07,89
我们要找的是供货商和发货人
at a price that's lower than the competition.

944
00:52:08,26 --> 00:52:10,10
海洛因,科卡因,冰毒
Well, what are we selling here, Frank?

945
00:52:10,11 --> 00:52:13,23
1000磅以下的大麻或40公斤以下的白粉

946
00:52:13,24 --> 00:52:15,45
任何小于这个数量的交易都不是我们要抓的

947
00:52:15,46 --> 00:52:19,15
我们要处理的是大批量的巨额交易

948
00:52:19,16 --> 00:52:23,29
我听说过你一件事,说你发现了笔一百万美元的赃款

949
00:52:23,30 --> 00:52:24,95
然后你把它上交了?

950
00:52:24,96 --> 00:52:26,41
是真的么?

951
00:52:26,86 --> 00:52:29,39
是的,谁对此事有意见?
How you doing, Red?

952
00:52:28,84 --> 00:52:30,60
These are my brothers, just got here from North Carolina.

953
00:52:30,72 --> 00:52:31,72
Everybody, this is Redtop.

954
00:52:31,89 --> 00:52:33,26
-Hello. -How you doing?

955
00:52:34,06 --> 00:52:34,96
我也有
And the ladies. Hey.

956
00:52:34,97 --> 00:52:39,18
我每天都想,要是不交的话我现在应该在佛罗里达泡在游泳池里享受佣人作的美食了
What wrong? Y'all niggas ain't never seen hoochie before?

957
00:52:39,19 --> 00:52:43,04
- 我们两个 - 但是,我没有所以我还在这儿
Why are they all naked?

958
00:52:40,65 --> 00:52:42,36
So they can't steal nothing.

959
00:52:42,90 --> 00:52:43,90
Right.

960
00:52:44,54 --> 00:52:46,76
我们来干出点名堂把
The most important thing in business is honesty, integrity, hard work,

961
00:52:50,70 --> 00:52:51,95
family,

962
00:52:52,87 --> 00:52:54,96
never forgetting where we came from.

963
00:52:55,21 --> 00:52:56,92
Thank you, Charlene.

964
00:53:01,84 --> 00:53:06,84
See, you are what you are in this world, that's either one of two things.

965
00:53:08,55 --> 00:53:10,64
Either you're somebody,

966
00:53:11,52 --> 00:53:13,85
or you're nobody. Be right back.

967
00:53:13,87 --> 00:53:15,57
- 怎么样? - 搞定

968
00:53:29,91 --> 00:53:32,21
I need these fresh. 'Cause if I have to come back here and get you,

969
00:53:32,37 --> 00:53:33,37
-you know what it is. Tango.

970
00:53:33,50 --> 00:53:35,00
-Don't y'all play that. Yes, sir, I hear you.

971
00:53:35,13 --> 00:53:37,04
You won't have to come back. There won't be no problem.

972
00:53:37,17 --> 00:53:38,75
What about you, Frank? You need anything?

973
00:53:39,20 --> 00:53:40,88
- 你看见了么Richie? - 是的
Where's my money? Redtop gave you the package.

974
00:53:41,25 --> 00:53:44,11
- 这是常见的普通货 - 我明白
You're supposed to be handing me my money.

975
00:53:44,12 --> 00:53:47,18
这是蓝色魔法,是普通货两倍的药效强度
Here's a jar right here. Twenty percent.

976
00:53:44,59 --> 00:53:46,85
-You got the jar? -That's right.

977
00:53:47,19 --> 00:53:50,05
这是我在街头看见过的最纯的货
Get the fuck out of here... What you gonna do?

978
00:53:50,06 --> 00:53:51,80
都可以直接吸食
What the fuck you gonna do, Frank? Huh? What you doing?

979
00:53:52,14 --> 00:53:54,96
那是白人富家子弟才干的
You gonna shoot me in front of everybody? Huh? Come on.

980
00:53:55,06 --> 00:53:56,91
买这个我只花了10块钱

981
00:53:56,92 --> 00:53:59,77
而且这货到处都是,随便我走到哪个角落都找的到

982
00:53:59,78 --> 00:54:01,16
这怎么可能
Shit.

983
00:54:01,60 --> 00:54:04,50
这么多两倍纯度的好货,谁做得起这种买卖

984
00:54:13,16 --> 00:54:16,11
嗨Frank,见到你真高兴
There you go. Twenty percent.

985
00:54:16,12 --> 00:54:16,90
- 还好? - 当然,

986
00:54:16,91 --> 00:54:19,60
我刚回来,那儿好东西好朋友很多

987
00:54:23,28 --> 00:54:25,74
你看上去好极了,真棒

988
00:54:34,81 --> 00:54:36,67
知道我的意思吧,接着

989
00:54:37,60 --> 00:54:38,84
给你

990
00:54:40,03 --> 00:54:41,87
So, what was I saying?

991
00:54:43,93 --> 00:54:44,98
看看这是谁阿

992
00:54:51,17 --> 00:54:52,21
Jones.

993
00:54:54,01 --> 00:54:55,72
Jonesy.

994
00:54:56,57 --> 00:54:58,29
女士们先生们
That was nice, man.

995
00:54:58,30 --> 00:55:01,17
"棕色轰炸机",重量级拳王

996
00:55:01,18 --> 00:55:03,11
Joe Louis先生
-Just doing my melodious thing, baby. -Got you.

997
00:55:10,27 --> 00:55:13,69
This is the newly formed Essex County Narcotics Squad.

998
00:55:11,89 --> 00:55:13,35
和Joe在一起的是谁?

999
00:55:13,65 --> 00:55:14,95
波多黎各小姐
Our mandate is to make major arrests. No street guys.

1000
00:55:15,39 --> 00:55:17,21
波多黎各?

1001
00:55:17,50 --> 00:55:18,65
选美冠军?

1002
00:55:18,66 --> 00:55:20,89
真正的冠军
We're looking for the suppliers and the distributors.

1003
00:55:22,87 --> 00:55:26,00
Heroin, cocaine, amphetamines. No grass under 1,000 pounds.

1004
00:55:26,13 --> 00:55:27,84
No powder under 40 kilograms.

1005
00:55:27,96 --> 00:55:29,88
Any less than that, then somebody else can waste their time.

1006
00:55:30,00 --> 00:55:33,72
We gonna be handling the big shipments, the big money and the big temptation.

1007
00:55:33,84 --> 00:55:35,05
I heard a story about you.

1008
00:55:35,18 --> 00:55:37,93
That you found a million dollars in unmarked cash

1009
00:55:38,06 --> 00:55:40,81
and gave that shit back. Is that true?

1010
00:55:41,52 --> 00:55:44,48
Yeah, I did. Anybody got a problem with that?

1011
00:55:48,65 --> 00:55:50,74
So do I, you know? I think about it every day.

1012
00:55:50,86 --> 00:55:53,78
I should be down in South Florida with a 68-foot cruiser doing fishing charters.

1013
00:55:53,19 --> 00:55:55,19
能让我们单独说几句话么
You and me, both.

1014
00:55:55,20 --> 00:55:56,39
当然Frank
But you know, I didn't, so here I am,

1015
00:55:58,64 --> 00:56:00,10
谢谢
and we'll be looking to land other kind of sharks.

1016
00:56:04,04 --> 00:56:05,58
怎么了

1017
00:56:05,59 --> 00:56:06,83
你笑什么笑

1018
00:56:06,84 --> 00:56:08,62
- 我不知道 - 这是什么玩艺儿

1019
00:56:08,63 --> 00:56:10,49
什么什么玩艺儿?

1020
00:56:10,50 --> 00:56:15,00
过来,你看你那是什么

1021
00:56:15,02 --> 00:56:16,66
什么,什么啊?

1022
00:56:16,67 --> 00:56:19,13
对,就哪个,你身上那玩意儿

1023
00:56:19,14 --> 00:56:20,81
非常非常好的西服

1024
00:56:20,82 --> 00:56:22,49
非常非常好的西服是么?

1025
00:56:22,50 --> 00:56:25,06
那是小丑穿的戏服,上面写着大大的字

1026
00:56:25,07 --> 00:56:26,74
..."快来抓我"

1027
00:56:26,75 --> 00:56:29,21
明白么? 你太引人注目了,太吵了

1028
00:56:29,22 --> 00:56:33,05
看着我,房间里最吵的人往往是最弱的人
-All right? Bingo.

1029
00:56:33,06 --> 00:56:35,34
我告诉过你,记得么?

1030
00:56:35,35 --> 00:56:37,23
你想变成像Nicky Barnes那样儿?

1031
00:56:37,24 --> 00:56:39,78
- Nicky怎么了,我挺喜欢Nicky - Nicky没什么不好

1032
00:56:39,79 --> 00:56:40,92
- 哦,你喜欢Nicky - 是啊

1033
00:56:40,93 --> 00:56:42,94
你想变成Nicky那样儿?想当大明星?

1034
00:56:42,95 --> 00:56:44,71
想去给他干活?

1035
00:56:46,71 --> 00:56:47,81
他想和你谈谈

1036
00:56:47,82 --> 00:56:49,91
你是在和他谈论我么

1037
00:56:49,92 --> 00:56:52,41
- 是什么,你们谈的是什么 - 不是那么回事儿

1038
00:56:52,42 --> 00:56:54,15
我们就是无意中聊到你了
See that, Richie? -Yeah.

1039
00:56:54,16 --> 00:56:55,69
聊到我什么?

1040
00:56:55,70 --> 00:56:57,90
我不知道,伙计,我跟他说我会告诉你的
And this stuff is your everyday stuff.

1041
00:56:58,98 --> 00:57:01,82
But this Blue Magic, twice the potency.

1042
00:57:00,52 --> 00:57:02,27
小子
I mean, it's the purest thing I ever seen in the streets. It's strong enough to smoke.

1043
00:57:03,48 --> 00:57:06,62
你要不是我弟弟我就干掉你了,知道么

1044
00:57:06,63 --> 00:57:09,34
- 我他妈会把你的脑浆都打出来 - 别这样,哥们
And that's for those white suburban kids who are scared of needles.

1045
00:57:09,35 --> 00:57:10,78
我这周带你去买东西
I paid 10 bucks for that.

1046
00:57:11,74 --> 00:57:14,37
And it's everywhere. I mean, it's on every corner out there.

1047
00:57:14,50 --> 00:57:16,25
So, how is that possible?

1048
00:57:16,37 --> 00:57:20,00
Who can afford to sell shit twice as good for half as much?

1049
00:57:27,93 --> 00:57:30,27
Hey, man. Frankie, baby, good to see you!

1050
00:57:30,39 --> 00:57:31,39
Everything's good?

1051
00:57:31,52 --> 00:57:32,60
Yeah, man, just got back from Europe,

1052
00:57:32,73 --> 00:57:35,23
over there for two months, south of France, man.

1053
00:57:37,98 --> 00:57:40,94
Look right, look right. Wonderful, wonderful.

1054
00:57:43,43 --> 00:57:45,00
嗨
Nicky!

1055
00:57:46,61 --> 00:57:48,47
你还欠我一支舞呢,对不?
Give us a smile, Nicky.

1056
00:57:48,48 --> 00:57:49,73
Doc,快点
Show us the cover.

1057
00:57:49,74 --> 00:57:52,69
Frank,你看
You know what I'm saying, man?

1058
00:57:50,75 --> 00:57:52,04
Hey, Nicky, over here.

1059
00:57:52,16 --> 00:57:53,58
There you go.

1060
00:57:55,84 --> 00:57:57,17
Nicky!

1061
00:57:58,67 --> 00:58:01,47
Who is that? Look at you, my man.

1062
00:58:02,97 --> 00:58:03,75
你好

1063
00:58:03,76 --> 00:58:04,91
你好

1064
00:58:04,92 --> 00:58:05,82
Frank Lucas

1065
00:58:05,83 --> 00:58:07,21
Eva

1066
00:58:07,68 --> 00:58:08,86
很高兴见到你

1067
00:58:08,87 --> 00:58:10,50
很高兴见到你Frank
All right.

1068
00:58:11,93 --> 00:58:13,89
你是Frank,这是你的夜总会?
Ladies and gentlemen,

1069
00:58:13,90 --> 00:58:16,67
对,我是Frank,这是我的夜总会
the Brown Bomber! The champ!

1070
00:58:15,77 --> 00:58:17,36
Mr Joe Louis!

1071
00:58:22,49 --> 00:58:24,39
那为什么店名叫Small's

1072
00:58:24,73 --> 00:58:26,60
为什么不叫Frank's

1073
00:58:27,75 --> 00:58:30,38
要是你的东西你就可以随便给它起名字
Who's that with Joe?

1074
00:58:28,41 --> 00:58:30,29
Miss Puerto Rico.

1075
00:58:31,44 --> 00:58:32,83
Small's
-Puerto Rico? Is she a beauty queen? -Mmm-hmm.

1076
00:58:32,84 --> 00:58:34,62
或者Frank's
For real. The beauty queen.

1077
00:58:34,63 --> 00:58:36,21
Frankie small's

1078
00:58:36,22 --> 00:58:37,52
Small's Frankie

1079
00:58:39,22 --> 00:58:40,65
说的对

1080
00:58:41,29 --> 00:58:42,88
可以放开我的手了么?

1081
00:58:44,82 --> 00:58:46,12
ok

1082
00:58:47,39 --> 00:58:48,55
你要离开了么?

1083
00:58:48,56 --> 00:58:50,07
不,我要回我的桌子去

1084
00:58:50,08 --> 00:58:52,13
需要护花使者么?

1085
00:58:54,67 --> 00:58:56,17
- 需要?

1086
00:59:00,46 --> 00:59:02,38
嗨,这儿呢,都有什么
-Welcome. -My main man. My main man.

1087
00:59:02,39 --> 00:59:05,00
你洗手了么?我只有这一张,别弄脏了

1088
00:59:07,86 --> 00:59:09,46
Spearman,他呢?
Can you all excuse us for a minute, please?

1089
00:59:09,47 --> 00:59:10,18
那是谁
Yeah, sure, Frank.

1090
00:59:10,19 --> 00:59:12,12
Joey Cattano,Don Cattano的外甥
Yes, sir.

1091
00:59:12,13 --> 00:59:14,15
对,对,把他贴在老大的边上
Thank you.

1092
00:59:14,16 --> 00:59:15,58
长得像你叔叔,Abruzzo

1093
00:59:15,59 --> 00:59:16,84
是,但他没我叔叔帅

1094
00:59:16,85 --> 00:59:18,24
他长得更像你妹妹

1095
00:59:19,02 --> 00:59:21,38
是,很好笑是么
What's going on, man?

1096
00:59:21,39 --> 00:59:23,78
所以我们要找的是 "冰锥" Paul
-What you smiling about? -I don't know.

1097
00:59:22,02 --> 00:59:24,64
-What is this? Huh? -What's what?

1098
00:59:23,79 --> 00:59:25,81
"冰锥" Paul,sure,yeah
-What's what? -Come here.

1099
00:59:25,91 --> 00:59:31,46
不对不对,"冰锥" Paul只是个打手

1100
00:59:28,44 --> 00:59:29,73
What is that you got on?

1101
00:59:29,86 --> 00:59:31,40
What's what, man?

1102
00:59:31,47 --> 00:59:35,64
(您通过了1970年新泽西法律考试) ...而这家伙是个大哥,这怎么可能
Yeah, that! What you got on.

1103
00:59:33,57 --> 00:59:34,82
This is a very, very, very nice suit.

1104
00:59:34,95 --> 00:59:36,74
That's a very, very, very nice suit, huh?

1105
00:59:37,03 --> 00:59:40,26
那家伙是个打手,这家伙是个大哥
-That's a clown suit. That's a costume... -Come on, man.

1106
00:59:38,95 --> 00:59:41,16
...with a big sign on it that says "Arrest Me."

1107
00:59:41,29 --> 00:59:44,42
You understand? You're too loud. You're making too much noise. Look at me.

1108
00:59:44,54 --> 00:59:49,05
The loudest one in the room is the weakest one in the room. I told you that.

1109
00:59:46,77 --> 00:59:50,40
嗨,你们谁曾真正见过"冰锥"Paul贩毒?

1110
00:59:50,41 --> 00:59:52,45
实际上我见过他和那些人接触
All right? What, are you trying to be like Nicky Barnes, now?

1111
00:59:52,46 --> 00:59:56,11
是他当然可以和那些人接触,我是说亲眼见到他贩毒
What's your problem with Nicky, man? I like Nicky.

1112
00:59:53,43 --> 00:59:54,97
I ain't got no problem with Nicky. Oh, you like Nicky?

1113
00:59:56,12 --> 00:59:57,88
那个线人Rickey告诉我们的
-Yeah! -You want to be like Nicky?

1114
00:59:57,89 --> 01:00:01,03
他大概四周前就死了
You want to be superfly? You wanna work for him?

1115
00:59:59,27 --> 01:00:01,06
Share a jail cell with him? Maybe cook for him?

1116
01:00:01,18 --> 01:00:02,23
He wants to talk to you.

1117
01:00:02,88 --> 01:00:04,13
他已经死了
-Oh, so now you talking to him about me? -What? You...

1118
01:00:04,14 --> 01:00:06,30
好,我看我们可以把他从板上摘下来了
-About what? What is it about? -It ain't like that.

1119
01:00:06,31 --> 01:00:11,02
我不认为我们掌握了那些照片上的人的任何确凿证据
-Then what is it like? -We were talking,

1120
01:00:08,36 --> 01:00:10,24
-your name came up. -About what?

1121
01:00:11,35 --> 01:00:14,18
你说什么啊,Richie,这可是几个星期的工作
I don't know, man. I told him I'd tell you.

1122
01:00:14,19 --> 01:00:16,73
我说把那些摘下来,我们要出去从头开始
You know... Boy, you...

1123
01:00:18,41 --> 01:00:21,08
You know, if you wasn't my brother, I'd kill you. You know that, don't you?

1124
01:00:20,12 --> 01:00:22,82
这可比一年的薪水多得多,Richie
I'd blow your motherfucking brains out.

1125
01:00:24,41 --> 01:00:28,54
它们要是不见了,别指望我再给你弄来
Come on, man. Don't be like that.

1126
01:00:24,21 --> 01:00:25,46
I'm taking you shopping this week.

1127
01:00:25,59 --> 01:00:27,42
-I went shopping. -I can tell.

1128
01:00:27,55 --> 01:00:30,22
See deep into you

1129
01:00:30,09 --> 01:00:31,28
这是你的
And know what you're thinking now

1130
01:00:31,29 --> 01:00:33,31
又把我自己卖给你了

1131
01:00:34,00 --> 01:00:35,70
为这恶心的2万块钱

1132
01:00:36,47 --> 01:00:39,52
And if I'm what you're needing

1133
01:00:38,95 --> 01:00:39,96
你保证货是"蓝色魔法"?
I need some kind of sign

1134
01:00:39,97 --> 01:00:41,81
对,对,我保证

1135
01:00:42,73 --> 01:00:43,64
你明天来这儿提货

1136
01:00:43,65 --> 01:00:45,11
两万美元
Let me know, 'cause I can't read your mind

1137
01:00:45,12 --> 01:00:46,49
放这儿吧

1138
01:00:51,83 --> 01:00:55,33
Are you in or am I in this on my own?

1139
01:00:55,45 --> 01:00:57,58
I need some clue from you

1140
01:00:58,37 --> 01:01:00,04
It's a tax thing.

1141
01:01:00,76 --> 01:01:01,71
怎么样
It's a mistake my lawyers are straightening out,

1142
01:01:01,72 --> 01:01:03,07
不错
-but for the time being... -How much do you owe, Joe?

1143
01:01:04,80 --> 01:01:06,13
他出来了

1144
01:01:06,14 --> 01:01:06,95
就是他?
It's nothing. It's like...

1145
01:01:06,96 --> 01:01:08,27
对

1146
01:01:09,03 --> 01:01:10,65
够快的
Fifty grand.

1147
01:01:12,60 --> 01:01:14,27
You got it.

1148
01:01:15,31 --> 01:01:18,15
Thank you, man. Hey, I'm gonna pay you back as soon as I...

1149
01:01:18,27 --> 01:01:21,65
Joe, this ain't no loan. It's a gift. All right?

1150
01:01:22,23 --> 01:01:23,90
Richie,他在向城里开,我们怎么办
All you did for Bumpy, we owe you.

1151
01:01:23,91 --> 01:01:26,37
跟着钱,我们要跟着钱
Keep your chin up. All right? Okay?

1152
01:01:26,38 --> 01:01:27,79
我们不能去城里
All you have which is down there. Down. Chin down.

1153
01:01:27,80 --> 01:01:28,82
我们可以

1154
01:01:28,83 --> 01:01:31,95
那可是2万块钱,要是没了我怎么办?

1155
01:01:31,96 --> 01:01:32,55
跟着钱走
All right. Doc, will see you, okay?

1156
01:01:32,56 --> 01:01:33,69
那只是权限的问题

1157
01:01:33,70 --> 01:01:34,76
跟着钱!!!

1158
01:01:34,77 --> 01:01:36,32
行行行!!
You play it so cool

1159
01:01:36,79 --> 01:01:37,92
Hey!

1160
01:01:39,46 --> 01:01:40,34
You still owe me that dance, right?

1161
01:01:40,46 --> 01:01:42,21
Doc, come on.

1162
01:01:46,64 --> 01:01:47,64
Frank, check this.

1163
01:01:51,26 --> 01:01:52,38
他要停车了

1164
01:01:52,69 --> 01:01:54,30
好,我们跟上

1165
01:01:54,85 --> 01:01:56,35
让我在这儿下车
-How you doing? -Hi.

1166
01:01:58,64 --> 01:02:00,35
别走开?
-Frank Lucas. -Eva Kendo.

1167
01:02:00,36 --> 01:02:01,80
我在下个街区等你
Nice to meet you, Eva.

1168
01:02:02,76 --> 01:02:04,07
开车!
Nice to meet you, Frank.

1169
01:02:04,87 --> 01:02:06,87
You're Frank and this is your place?

1170
01:02:06,99 --> 01:02:10,00
That's right. I'm Frank and this is my place.

1171
01:02:10,96 --> 01:02:14,63
Why is it called Small's? Why don't you call it Frank's?

1172
01:02:16,09 --> 01:02:19,63
When you own something, you can call it what you want.

1173
01:02:19,76 --> 01:02:21,01
Small's.

1174
01:02:21,13 --> 01:02:23,93
Or Frank's. Frankie Small's.

1175
01:02:24,51 --> 01:02:26,06
Small's Frankie.

1176
01:02:27,56 --> 01:02:29,02
That's right.

1177
01:02:29,52 --> 01:02:31,56
You want to let my hand go?

1178
01:02:33,06 --> 01:02:34,23
Okay.

1179
01:02:35,65 --> 01:02:36,69
You leaving?

1180
01:02:36,82 --> 01:02:38,19
No, I was going to my table.

1181
01:02:38,32 --> 01:02:40,78
Okay. Need somebody to go with you?

1182
01:02:39,85 --> 01:02:40,98
坐下

1183
01:02:43,31 --> 01:02:44,95
生日快乐啊,先生们
-Yes? Mmm-hmm.

1184
01:02:47,70 --> 01:02:48,71
All the cheesies.

1185
01:02:48,83 --> 01:02:50,54
Right here, here we go. What have we got here?

1186
01:02:50,52 --> 01:02:52,93
- 看看这个 - 包里是什么
Wash your hands? I got one print of that, don't smudge it.

1187
01:02:53,47 --> 01:02:55,09
站起来,快他妈起来
Yeah.

1188
01:02:55,10 --> 01:02:57,90
- 那是我的包,朋友 - 谁是你朋友,给我闭嘴

1189
01:02:57,91 --> 01:02:58,83
- 把头低下 - 闭嘴
Hey, Spearman, what about him? -Who is that?

1190
01:02:58,84 --> 01:03:00,97
- 你要干什么? - 坐下,闭上鸟嘴
Joey Sodano. Don Cattano's nephew.

1191
01:03:00,98 --> 01:03:02,42
你再动一下看看
Yeah, yeah. Put him up there by the big man.

1192
01:03:02,26 --> 01:03:03,64
He looks like your uncle, Abruzzo.

1193
01:03:03,76 --> 01:03:04,85
Yeah, but he's not as handsome.

1194
01:03:05,02 --> 01:03:07,23
He looks more like your sister. Where's Ice Pick's mug?

1195
01:03:07,35 --> 01:03:08,35
Yeah, that's funny.

1196
01:03:08,48 --> 01:03:09,65
Maybe you guys should take that show on the road.

1197
01:03:09,77 --> 01:03:12,15
So we need Ice Pick Paul.

1198
01:03:12,27 --> 01:03:13,61
Ice Pick Paul? Sure. Yeah.

1199
01:03:15,04 --> 01:03:16,71
嗨伙计们伙计们
There you go. Get him up.

1200
01:03:16,72 --> 01:03:17,94
警官们
Ice Pick Paul, he goes way up there, up top.

1201
01:03:18,40 --> 01:03:20,69
我是Richie Roberts
No, Ice Pick Paul, he's a fucking soldier. This guy's a lieutenant.

1202
01:03:22,75 --> 01:03:24,56
那是我的钱
How's that even fucking possible?

1203
01:03:22,83 --> 01:03:24,83
That's Benny the Bishop.

1204
01:03:25,24 --> 01:03:27,78
说他妈什么呢,什么钱? 什么钱?
That guy is a soldier. This guy's a lieutenant. No way that guy's on top.

1205
01:03:29,28 --> 01:03:33,51
钞票是按序排好的而且已经在Essex县检察院注册过
You thinking of Benny the Bishop.

1206
01:03:30,92 --> 01:03:33,80
Vinnie Two Socks is fucking Cattano's deadbeat son-in-law.

1207
01:03:33,52 --> 01:03:34,43
你们可以自己看
Jonesy's right.

1208
01:03:34,44 --> 01:03:37,58
所有的钞票都是CF3500打头,你们看
Hey, which one of you guys has ever actually seen Ice Pick Paul selling drugs?

1209
01:03:37,01 --> 01:03:38,39
Actually seen it go down?

1210
01:03:42,84 --> 01:03:44,15
是他妈注册的
Yeah, seen it go down. Been in his place. Seen him handle drugs.

1211
01:03:44,16 --> 01:03:46,98
我刚才还想用这钱买艘他妈好游艇呢
That rat, Ricky, has told us...

1212
01:03:47,43 --> 01:03:48,59
不好意思,是我的错
He's fucking dead. About four weeks ago.

1213
01:03:48,60 --> 01:03:49,87
那我就把钱拿回来了

1214
01:03:51,93 --> 01:03:53,55
下不为例
He's dead.

1215
01:03:52,15 --> 01:03:54,40
All right, well, we can take him off the fucking board.

1216
01:03:54,69 --> 01:03:56,41
好了
I don't think we got any solid evidence on anybody on that board.

1217
01:03:57,18 --> 01:04:03,24
我上次在新泽西是在...我想想,我从没去过新泽西

1218
01:03:59,58 --> 01:04:02,50
What you saying, Richie? This is weeks and weeks of work, man.

1219
01:04:02,62 --> 01:04:06,08
I'm saying, take it down. We got to start again from the street.

1220
01:04:05,21 --> 01:04:07,38
你不通告我们擅自跑这儿来干嘛?

1221
01:04:07,39 --> 01:04:09,40
你觉得你这么做不会有麻烦?

1222
01:04:11,45 --> 01:04:13,39
拿回你的钱

1223
01:04:13,40 --> 01:04:15,04
Richie

1224
01:04:15,39 --> 01:04:19,14
永远不要在未通知我们的情况下来这座城市

1225
01:04:19,15 --> 01:04:21,38
你要想来看场百老汇演出

1226
01:04:21,73 --> 01:04:24,26
先给我打电话看我是否同意

1227
01:04:26,05 --> 01:04:27,73
没问题

1228
01:04:32,63 --> 01:04:34,27
再见了伙计

1229
01:04:37,11 --> 01:04:38,66
那是你的车?

1230
01:04:39,06 --> 01:04:41,12
那可真他妈是俩好车啊

1231
01:04:41,13 --> 01:04:43,50
回新泽西一路顺风

1232
01:04:43,83 --> 01:04:45,13
好

1233
01:04:45,14 --> 01:04:47,47
来吧,我们走

1234
01:05:00,59 --> 01:05:02,40
这是你父亲?

1235
01:05:02,93 --> 01:05:05,14
那是马丁路德金

1236
01:05:05,75 --> 01:05:07,83
- 他不是 - 是,他是马丁路德金

1237
01:05:07,84 --> 01:05:09,07
你知道 "我有一个梦想"

1238
01:05:09,08 --> 01:05:10,46
当然

1239
01:05:10,73 --> 01:05:16,28
不,那是...他对于我来说和马丁路德金一样重要

1240
01:05:16,29 --> 01:05:17,76
他做过些什么?

1241
01:05:18,21 --> 01:05:19,18
很多事情

1242
01:05:19,19 --> 01:05:24,05
他是一位益友,造福纽约,纽约也帮助了他

1243
01:05:25,34 --> 01:05:27,17
他是我的老板

1244
01:05:27,18 --> 01:05:28,90
我的老师

1245
01:05:28,91 --> 01:05:30,35
他教过你些什么?

1246
01:05:30,36 --> 01:05:32,71
他教了我许多东西

1247
01:05:34,76 --> 01:05:36,92
他教我如何使用时间

1248
01:05:38,26 --> 01:05:42,76
教我用心用爱去做每一件事

1249
01:05:43,19 --> 01:05:44,84
还有什么其他的么?

1250
01:05:49,11 --> 01:05:51,03
教我如何做一名绅士

1251
01:05:51,45 --> 01:05:52,69
你是绅士么?

1252
01:05:52,70 --> 01:05:54,14
我要尝试去做一名绅士

1253
01:05:54,15 --> 01:05:55,60
过来

1254
01:05:56,30 --> 01:05:58,25
过来,来这儿

1255
01:06:00,59 --> 01:06:02,42
看着我

1256
01:06:02,77 --> 01:06:06,03
我在曼哈顿有五座公寓

1257
01:06:07,26 --> 01:06:11,29
我在东海岸有很多房产,我本可以带你去其中任何一处但是我没有

1258
01:06:11,30 --> 01:06:12,78
- 我之所以带你来这里... - Frank

1259
01:06:12,79 --> 01:06:14,26
我还在找你呢,孩子

1260
01:06:14,27 --> 01:06:15,54
...是因为我想让你见见我的妈妈

1261
01:06:16,12 --> 01:06:17,85
妈你好么

1262
01:06:17,86 --> 01:06:19,27
这就是她?

1263
01:06:19,28 --> 01:06:21,48
- Eva,这是我母亲 - 你好,我是Eva

1264
01:06:22,04 --> 01:06:23,33
很高兴见到你

1265
01:06:23,34 --> 01:06:25,17
她真美

1266
01:06:25,18 --> 01:06:26,75
你看她,Frank

1267
01:06:26,76 --> 01:06:30,32
她是坠入凡间的天使

1268
01:06:30,33 --> 01:06:31,85
谢谢

1269
01:06:39,72 --> 01:06:41,20
Roberts先生

1270
01:06:41,21 --> 01:06:43,10

1271
01:06:47,14 --> 01:06:48,85
- 早上好 - 早

1272
01:06:51,37 --> 01:06:53,35
抱歉,我们有约?

1273
01:06:53,36 --> 01:06:55,22
儿童社会服务

1274
01:07:09,66 --> 01:07:11,55
不过她提到了你的名字

1275
01:07:12,67 --> 01:07:14,02
Stewardess?

1276
01:07:14,03 --> 01:07:15,81
不,不是Stewardess

1277
01:07:16,48 --> 01:07:17,81
一位做儿童服务的女士

1278
01:07:17,82 --> 01:07:19,38
就在她问我是否与任何犯罪分子有联系之后

1279
01:07:20,21 --> 01:07:23,88
她提到了你的名字
Hi, who's this?

1280
01:07:22,22 --> 01:07:25,43
-Hello? Gabe? Yeah, it's Scott: -Yeah:

1281
01:07:24,28 --> 01:07:25,28
打呀,快打
Scotty! What's going down, brother?

1282
01:07:25,29 --> 01:07:26,57
你们看这个

1283
01:07:26,58 --> 01:07:28,02
孩子们

1284
01:07:28,27 --> 01:07:30,35
Joey,嗨Joey
Those snow tyres you gave me last night: They come in yet?

1285
01:07:30,36 --> 01:07:31,72
出去到游泳池玩儿,快点
-Oh, the snow tyres? -Yeah: I want some more of them:

1286
01:07:33,17 --> 01:07:34,85
快点快点

1287
01:07:35,32 --> 01:07:37,57
-Give me one-and-a-half more: -One-and-a-half,

1288
01:07:37,70 --> 01:07:41,08
-that's a pretty big order. -Yeah, I want the big whitewalls,

1289
01:07:39,63 --> 01:07:41,18
她怎么会知道我名字

1290
01:07:41,19 --> 01:07:42,78
Laurie
they better get at least 100,000 miles:

1291
01:07:43,74 --> 01:07:45,94
很多人最近都找过她
All right, I'll tell you what. You come in here tomorrow morning

1292
01:07:46,98 --> 01:07:48,93
很多人
I'm gonna set you up real nice with a whitewall special, all right?

1293
01:07:52,15 --> 01:07:54,60
当你问我做你儿子教父的时候
-Thanks, bro: -No problem:

1294
01:07:54,61 --> 01:07:56,68
- 我是非常认真地接受的 - 我知道
That's considerably more than one year's salary, Richie.

1295
01:07:56,69 --> 01:07:58,07
我知道并且我非常感激这一点

1296
01:07:58,08 --> 01:08:00,78
我同意了并乐于接受这份责任

1297
01:08:00,79 --> 01:08:03,65
如果一旦你发生不测,我会照顾好你的儿子并领养他
If it disappears, I will not be able to get it for you again.

1298
01:08:03,66 --> 01:08:08,31
Joe,她在儿童社会服务机构说那些事让我感觉非常糟糕

1299
01:08:05,77 --> 01:08:06,90
That's yours.

1300
01:08:08,32 --> 01:08:13,61
你也清楚我认识成千的三教九流的人,线人,女人
Signing my life away again, for a lousy twenty grand.

1301
01:08:13,62 --> 01:08:15,67
还有像我这样的老朋友
-It has to be Blue Magic, right? -Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's gonna be Blue.

1302
01:08:16,60 --> 01:08:18,44
对,还有像你这样的老朋友

1303
01:08:18,37 --> 01:08:19,41
You can pick it up here tomorrow.

1304
01:08:20,54 --> 01:08:22,77
Joey叔叔,Joey叔叔,你看你看
$20,000.

1305
01:08:20,66 --> 01:08:22,37
Just leave it there.

1306
01:08:26,31 --> 01:08:27,60
是,我理解

1307
01:08:27,61 --> 01:08:30,18
他们要是问我,我就按你想让我说的那样去告诉他们

1308
01:08:30,59 --> 01:08:31,97
我会为你..说谎

1309
01:08:31,98 --> 01:08:32,86
不,不要说谎

1310
01:08:32,87 --> 01:08:34,14
你没必要说谎

1311
01:08:34,15 --> 01:08:37,85
只需对某些特定细节有所保留

1312
01:08:37,86 --> 01:08:39,51
当然,没问题
-How'd you do? -Good.

1313
01:08:40,48 --> 01:08:41,89
Here he comes.

1314
01:08:42,12 --> 01:08:44,25
现在我想问你点别的事
-That's him? -Yep.

1315
01:08:44,26 --> 01:08:46,49
如果你不愿意可以不回答
That was quick.

1316
01:08:49,21 --> 01:08:51,14
"蓝色魔法"

1317
01:08:51,15 --> 01:08:52,68
你知道什么?

1318
01:08:53,75 --> 01:08:58,36
据我所知有很多人因此而悲哀痛苦的丢了饭碗,仅此而已

1319
01:08:57,83 --> 01:08:59,46
Richie, if he goes in the city, what do we fucking do?

1320
01:08:59,75 --> 01:09:01,48
你是说你的人?
Stay with the fucking money, that's what we do.

1321
01:09:01,49 --> 01:09:02,86
就是某些人
We stay with the money, all right?

1322
01:09:03,90 --> 01:09:05,81
你能告诉我这东西是哪儿来的么?
We can't go in the fucking city.

1323
01:09:03,79 --> 01:09:05,59
Yes, we can. That's 20 grand in there, all right,

1324
01:09:06,77 --> 01:09:09,33
我只听说是南边的人
that I'm responsible for. I ain't losing it.

1325
01:09:07,76 --> 01:09:09,34
It's out of our jurisdiction!

1326
01:09:10,08 --> 01:09:11,18
古巴人
Follow the money! All right, all right, all right!

1327
01:09:11,19 --> 01:09:12,38
我不知道

1328
01:09:12,89 --> 01:09:14,49
墨西哥人?

1329
01:09:14,89 --> 01:09:16,50
我不知道

1330
01:09:16,51 --> 01:09:18,31
你是说他们来自南美?

1331
01:09:18,65 --> 01:09:20,41
我不知道

1332
01:09:21,19 --> 01:09:25,45
我只能告诉你,不论这些人是谁,他们正在搅乱事务的正常秩序

1333
01:09:26,14 --> 01:09:27,94
就这些
He's pulling over.

1334
01:09:28,32 --> 01:09:30,32
All right, here we go.

1335
01:09:30,49 --> 01:09:31,78
Let me out here.

1336
01:09:34,33 --> 01:09:35,79
Don't disappear, all right?

1337
01:09:35,96 --> 01:09:37,87
I'll circle the block.

1338
01:09:38,42 --> 01:09:39,38
Move!

1339
01:09:43,51 --> 01:09:44,17
你好

1340
01:09:44,18 --> 01:09:45,34
好兄弟

1341

皇后区

1347
01:10:15,75 --> 01:10:17,67
Who the fuck cares about you? This is New York City, man.

1348
01:10:17,84 --> 01:10:19,96
-Get someone else's car! -Get out of the car.

1349
01:10:20,13 --> 01:10:22,38
Come on, man. Can't we live in peace...

你好,Sobota先生

1355
01:11:18,73 --> 01:11:19,84
- 你好 - 你需要点什么

1356
01:11:19,85 --> 01:11:22,40

恕我失陪,女士们

1360
01:11:27,45 --> 01:11:30,53
这孩子很不错,我要你把他弄进洋基队,因为你够棒,对么?

1361
01:11:30,54 --> 01:11:31,40
我是Lucas

你说什么啊,伙计

1372

你谁也不会逮捕

1373
01:12:04,45 --> 01:12:06,59

1378
01:12:20,85 --> 01:12:21,79
我说刚才那是怎么回事

1379
01:12:21,80 --> 01:12:23,39
什么怎么回事?

1380
01:12:23,40 --> 01:12:25,87
冷静点伙计,闭上你的嘴巴

Jimmy!!
What?

1383
01:12:35,32 --> 01:12:36,60
站起来
Happy birthday, gentlemen. How you doing, huh?

1384
01:12:37,24 --> 01:12:40,75
He's about to do something, huh? He's going bowling?

1385
01:12:41,66 --> 01:12:43,12
Look at that. Strike.

1386
01:12:43,29 --> 01:12:44,46
Hey, what's between your legs? What's in the bag?

1387
01:12:44,67 --> 01:12:46,25
Nothing. -Get up, you fucker. Get the fuck up!

1388
01:12:46,42 --> 01:12:47,42
Knock it off.

1389
01:12:47,59 --> 01:12:48,88
Shut the fuck up! What did I tell you?

1390
01:12:49,89 --> 01:12:51,70
好了,所有人都出去
Keep your fucking head down.

出去!
Shut up! Whose bag is this?

1392
01:12:51,43 --> 01:12:52,38
What're you doing? Sit down and shut up!

1393
01:12:53,80 --> 01:12:55,47
好了Frank,这只是个意外
Don't you move!

1394
01:12:55,48 --> 01:12:56,61
这可不是什么该死的意外

1395
01:12:56,62 --> 01:13:00,55
他根本不知所谓因为他总是在他妈磕药

1396
01:13:00,98 --> 01:13:02,95
他是你的司机,你搞定他

1397
01:13:02,96 --> 01:13:04,57
算了吧,他是你表弟

1398
01:13:04,58 --> 01:13:06,35
他对我来说狗屁不是,一钱不值

1399
01:13:06,36 --> 01:13:07,46
那他怎么办,回老家?
Hey, guys? Guys! Officers!

1400
01:13:07,47 --> 01:13:09,06
我才不管他干什么呢

1401
01:13:09,07 --> 01:13:10,00
送他回去
Hey, I'm Richie Roberts, from Newark.

1402
01:13:10,98 --> 01:13:13,99
不能擦,你要一点点按着吸

1403
01:13:14,00 --> 01:13:18,55
这是羊驼呢,价值25000美元的羊驼呢,你得按着吸
That's my money.

1404
01:13:16,66 --> 01:13:19,46
What the fuck? What money, huh? What money?

1405
01:13:18,56 --> 01:13:20,43
不能擦,放些清洗剂

1406
01:13:22,32 --> 01:13:26,14
听好了,从现在开始,没有人直接和我对话,明白么?
The bills are sequenced, right?

1407
01:13:22,63 --> 01:13:25,71
They're registered with the Essex County Prosecutor's Office. Just check them out.

1408
01:13:26,15 --> 01:13:28,43
有事情找我先跟Huey说
They all start with CF3500. Have a look.

1409
01:13:28,44 --> 01:13:30,05
Huey,然后你再和我谈,明白了么?

1410
01:13:30,06 --> 01:13:30,89
明白

1411
01:13:30,90 --> 01:13:32,44
该死,绝对不能在电话里说,知道么?

1412
01:13:32,45 --> 01:13:33,42
- 知道了 - 知道就好

1413
01:13:33,71 --> 01:13:35,95
把这他妈该死的太阳镜摘下来
Fucking registers.

1414
01:13:36,59 --> 01:13:38,95
- 给我把眼镜摘下来 - 该死
I thought I had a fucking Chris-Craft sitting in my driveway.

1415
01:13:38,98 --> 01:13:41,86
Honest mistake. I'll just get the money.

1416
01:13:41,91 --> 01:13:44,36
一群头脑简单的混蛋
-This time. -All right.

1417
01:13:46,15 --> 01:13:48,36
-There it is. All right. Thank you.

1418
01:13:48,49 --> 01:13:51,78
When was the last time I was in Jersey? Let me think.

1419
01:13:53,41 --> 01:13:54,58
Never.

1420
01:13:56,67 --> 01:13:58,67
What're you doing, coming over here unannounced?

1421
01:13:59,74 --> 01:14:02,28
这整座房子都是进口的
You don't think you could get hurt doing that?

1422
01:14:02,63 --> 01:14:04,49
每一砖一瓦都是
You got your fucking money, Richie.

1423
01:14:05,33 --> 01:14:07,60
格洛斯特郡
And never, ever come into this city again unannounced.

1424
01:14:07,61 --> 01:14:08,82
谁?

1425
01:14:08,83 --> 01:14:09,74
英国人

1426
01:14:10,32 --> 01:14:11,78
该你了
You come in to see a fucking Broadway show,

1427
01:14:13,18 --> 01:14:16,23
you call ahead first, see if it's okay with me.

1428
01:14:16,74 --> 01:14:18,69
给你
No problem. All right.

1429
01:14:22,67 --> 01:14:23,75
抛
Let's go, hit some balls. Great suits, pal.

1430
01:14:29,00 --> 01:14:30,64
跟我来,Eva
Is that your car?

1431
01:14:31,87 --> 01:14:34,65
我相信你一定颇不及待的想参观这房子剩余的部分
That's a fucking great car.

1432
01:14:33,79 --> 01:14:35,13
Have a nice fucking trip back to Jersey.

1433
01:14:35,25 --> 01:14:36,38
All right.

1434
01:14:36,50 --> 01:14:39,00
Come on, I got a tee time. Let's go.

1435
01:14:38,68 --> 01:14:41,34
当然,失陪了

1436
01:14:42,59 --> 01:14:44,47
非常感谢您丰盛的午餐
What were you doin' there?

1437
01:14:44,48 --> 01:14:45,98
非常可口
Well, that's where this dope is coming from. Blue Magic, it's coming out of New York.

1438
01:14:49,19 --> 01:14:51,53
你对垄断怎么看
What do you expect me to do, ignore it?

1439
01:14:50,18 --> 01:14:53,44
The cab driver has filed aggravated assault and grand theft charges

1440
01:14:52,69 --> 01:14:54,15
你是指体育比赛还是...
which he may reconsider

1441
01:14:54,16 --> 01:14:59,57
不,我只是在想这个国家视垄断为非法,Frank,因为没有人愿意竞争
depending on how much the State of New Jersey offers to settle.

1442
01:15:00,04 --> 01:15:01,59
没有人想去竞争
I showed him my ID. I told him I was a cop.

1443
01:15:01,60 --> 01:15:02,99
去和垄断者竟争

1444
01:15:03,00 --> 01:15:05,52
要是让奶农去进行垄断
You stole his cab and you knock him out.

1445
01:15:06,11 --> 01:15:08,06
那其中的半数明天就会失业
I was chasing the twenty grand, all right?

1446
01:15:08,07 --> 01:15:09,71
我只是想要谋生而已
Next time, knock him out before you show him your badge.

1447
01:15:09,72 --> 01:15:11,44
哦,对,你说的对

1448
01:15:11,45 --> 01:15:14,44
每个人都是对的,因为这是美国

1449
01:15:14,45 --> 01:15:18,46
但是你不能把谋生建立在其他人的不合理花费基础之上
Look, I don't want to hear about you going into New York again.

1450
01:15:19,05 --> 01:15:21,00
那样就会变得"非美国"
-Well, then this investigation's over. -You're not listening to me.

1451
01:15:21,01 --> 01:15:25,23
这就是为什么每加仑牛奶的价格反映了产品的实际成本
I said, "I don't want to hear about you going into New York again."

1452
01:15:25,24 --> 01:15:28,29
因为它需要被控制,要稳定
You do whatever you have to do. You go wherever you have to go

1453
01:15:26,85 --> 01:15:29,39
to figure out who's bringing this shit into the country.

1454
01:15:28,68 --> 01:15:29,77
要公道
Just don't tell me about it.

1455
01:15:29,78 --> 01:15:32,51
由谁来控制?我制定了一个我认为公道的价格
Just don't tell me about it.

1456
01:15:32,52 --> 01:15:33,46
我认为不公道

1457
01:15:33,47 --> 01:15:34,69
- 你认为不公道? - 我认为不公道

1458
01:15:34,70 --> 01:15:37,53
我知道你的顾客们会很高兴,Frank

1459
01:15:37,54 --> 01:15:39,61
他们是一群醉熏熏的浑蛋
There's your girl, right there.

1460
01:15:40,31 --> 01:15:42,85
Frank,可是这些你的奶农朋友怎么办

1461
01:15:43,43 --> 01:15:45,02
你考虑过我们么?
-Hey, how'd you do? -Hi.

1462
01:15:45,51 --> 01:15:47,15
你考虑过别人么?
-I didn't keep you waiting long, did I? -No. Fine.

1463
01:15:47,52 --> 01:15:48,71
奶农?
Good. A woman as beautiful as you shouldn't have to wait.

1464
01:15:48,72 --> 01:15:49,54
对

1465
01:15:49,55 --> 01:15:53,90
Dominic,我考虑他们的和他们曾考虑到我的基本差不多
For anything.

1466
01:15:54,46 --> 01:15:56,55
我有个想法

1467
01:15:57,32 --> 01:16:00,05
Frank,要是你从你的库存里抽出一部分
Thank you, ma'am. You as pretty as ever.

1468
01:16:00,06 --> 01:16:02,16
然后批发出售

1469
01:16:03,63 --> 01:16:09,15
请坐,有你的帮助,我们可以做一些分销

1470
01:16:05,43 --> 01:16:07,52
-Hey, Doc. -Tommy!

1471
01:16:07,65 --> 01:16:09,90
Heard your boy scored two touchdowns last week.

1472
01:16:10,38 --> 01:16:11,64
我不知道,Dominic,我现在生意不错
-Sure. Sure do make father proud. -All right.

1473
01:16:11,65 --> 01:16:15,32
我的货从110街卖到55街还有市中心曼哈顿,我挺满意

1474
01:16:15,67 --> 01:16:18,71
和我要说的相比那不过是杂货店的规模

1475
01:16:18,72 --> 01:16:20,70
我能让你变成超级连锁店

1476
01:16:20,71 --> 01:16:23,72
我是指洛杉矶,芝加哥,底特律以及拉斯维加斯

1477
01:16:23,73 --> 01:16:25,32
我们可以发展到全国
This is your father?

1478
01:16:25,87 --> 01:16:28,33
而且我可以保证你没有"后顾之忧"
That's Martin Luther King.

1479
01:16:28,99 --> 01:16:30,81
你难道没兴趣么
-It is not. -It is. It is Martin Luther King.

1480
01:16:31,65 --> 01:16:33,68
你会来领导这一切
You know, "I have a dream"?

1481
01:16:33,69 --> 01:16:35,55
我不知道你是怎么看我的
Of course.

1482
01:16:35,56 --> 01:16:37,50
我是个思想解放的人,Frank
No, that's...

1483
01:16:37,51 --> 01:16:39,65
普通人就是喜欢循规蹈矩
He was just as important as Martin Luther King to me.

1484
01:16:39,66 --> 01:16:41,73
他们没办法被启发,Frank
What did he do?

1485
01:16:41,74 --> 01:16:43,89
你和他们讲民权,他们跟本不知道
Did a lot of things. He was a friend and served New York. New York served him.

1486
01:16:44,45 --> 01:16:46,24
他们不会变得开放

1487
01:16:46,25 --> 01:16:49,22
不会因为事情的发展以及促成发展的人们而进行改变

1488
01:16:49,93 --> 01:16:53,08
我去和他们谈,这样就不会有误解
He was my boss.

1489
01:16:51,03 --> 01:16:52,32
My teacher.

1490
01:16:52,45 --> 01:16:53,91
What did he teach you?

1491
01:16:54,37 --> 01:16:56,06
这就是我所说的
He taught me a lot of things. He

1492
01:16:56,56 --> 01:16:58,61
无"后顾之忧"

1493
01:16:58,54 --> 01:17:00,75
taught me how to take my time.

1494
01:17:02,01 --> 01:17:05,72
你现在每公斤花多少钱,7万5还是8万
Taught me that if I was going to do something, to do it with care, with love.

1495
01:17:07,65 --> 01:17:10,41
我也是个思想解放的人
Anything else?

1496
01:17:11,02 --> 01:17:13,16
我给你的价格是5万

1497
01:17:13,01 --> 01:17:15,18
He taught me to be a gentleman.

1498
01:17:15,31 --> 01:17:16,39
That's what you are?

1499
01:17:16,51 --> 01:17:18,64
That's what I try to be. Come here.

1500
01:17:20,80 --> 01:17:24,81
你为什么相信这些人? 因为他们看你的眼神?
Come here. Sit right here.

1501
01:17:24,85 --> 01:17:29,81
- 他们把我当成他们的圣诞老人 - 他们是把我们当成救星了
Look at me.

1502
01:17:26,61 --> 01:17:29,65
I own about five apartments in Manhattan.

1503
01:17:29,85 --> 01:17:35,77
他们现在为我工作
Homes all over the East Coast,

1504
01:17:32,41 --> 01:17:35,12
I could have taken you to any one of them, but I didn't.

1505
01:17:35,24 --> 01:17:36,29
I brought you here.

1506
01:17:36,98 --> 01:17:42,95
我在这里预言,我和Frazier这场比赛是旗鼓相当,我会面对一位真正的职业拳手
Frank, I was looking for you, boy.

1507
01:17:37,91 --> 01:17:39,96
Because I wanted you to meet my mother.

1508
01:17:40,08 --> 01:17:41,63
How you doing, Ma?

1509
01:17:41,75 --> 01:17:42,84
Is this her?

1510
01:17:42,96 --> 01:17:44,50
-Eva, this is my mother. Hi, Eva.

1511
01:17:44,63 --> 01:17:45,80
Oh!

1512
01:17:46,95 --> 01:17:52,92
- 一定是阿里赢 - 来啊 看看这个
Nice to meet you.

1513
01:17:47,38 --> 01:17:48,97
-She's beautiful! Yeah?

1514
01:17:49,09 --> 01:17:54,06
Look at her, Frank. She's an ngel come down from heaven.

1515
01:17:54,18 --> 01:17:55,60
Thank you.

1516
01:17:55,84 --> 01:18:01,80
- 你看Frazier - 阿里会把他打的屁滚尿流

1517
01:18:03,53 --> 01:18:06,32
Mr Roberts? I'm here for our appointment.

1518
01:18:07,85 --> 01:18:13,77
1971年3月8日 我们 在麦迪逊广场花园球场期待这场世纪之战

1519
01:18:11,12 --> 01:18:12,79
-Morning. -Morning.

1520
01:18:13,81 --> 01:18:16,91
这是一场所有人期待的比赛
Sorry. Our appointment?

1521
01:18:16,94 --> 01:18:20,38
人们相互致意握手 当然 也有明艳照人的女孩们
Child Social Services.

1522
01:18:20,42 --> 01:18:23,82
但在握手与微笑背后

1523
01:18:23,86 --> 01:18:26,74
你可以感受到大战前的气氛是如此紧张

1524
01:18:26,78 --> 01:18:28,83
令人难以抗拒

1525
01:18:28,87 --> 01:18:34,83
所有人都到场了 比如Sinatra 比如Rosiano, David Borss和Diane Carol

1526
01:18:35,00 --> 01:18:40,96
还有Woddy Allen, Diane Keeton 所有名流都到场了
She did mention your name, though.

1527
01:18:36,52 --> 01:18:37,69
The stewardess?

1528
01:18:37,81 --> 01:18:39,65
No, not the stewardess.

1529
01:18:40,36 --> 01:18:43,95
The lady from Child Services. She mentioned your name.

1530
01:18:44,11 --> 01:18:48,08
Right after she asked me if I associated with any criminals.

1531
01:18:48,20 --> 01:18:49,20
All right, go! Go, go!

1532
01:18:49,33 --> 01:18:50,41
Yeah! You wanna see this? -Go, go.

1533
01:18:50,54 --> 01:18:52,08
Hey, boys.

1534
01:18:52,21 --> 01:18:54,04
Joey. Hey, Joey!

1535
01:18:54,17 --> 01:18:56,00
Get in the pool. Go on.

1536
01:18:57,04 --> 01:18:58,75
Come on. Come on.

1537
01:19:03,05 --> 01:19:05,05
So, how'd she get my name?

1538
01:19:05,18 --> 01:19:06,60
-Laurie. -Hmm.

1539
01:19:07,64 --> 01:19:09,98
She's been saying a lot lately.

1540
01:19:09,83 --> 01:19:14,83
- 你不想看比赛么 Bob? - 我不喜欢拳击
A lot.

1541
01:19:14,87 --> 01:19:16,92
这不是拳击 孩子
You know, when you asked me to be your son's godfather,

1542
01:19:16,96 --> 01:19:19,89
是政治

1543
01:19:18,57 --> 01:19:19,74
I took it very seriously.

1544
01:19:19,86 --> 01:19:21,70
I know. I know and I appreciate that.

1545
01:19:21,92 --> 01:19:25,84
- 我也有东西给你 - 是么?
And I said yes, I would take on this responsibility.

1546
01:19:24,91 --> 01:19:27,45
Take care of your son, if God forbid, something happened to you.

1547
01:19:27,89 --> 01:19:30,97
不错 给我的?
Joe, the kind of things she's saying to Child Social Services

1548
01:19:31,01 --> 01:19:32,30
你喜欢么?
made me look really bad, all right. You know,

1549
01:19:32,93 --> 01:19:37,23
大衣? 喜欢啊 挺好看的
out at all kinds of hours at night time, lowlife informants around, women.

1550
01:19:38,77 --> 01:19:39,82
你怎么想?

You know, there's something else I was gonna ask you.

He don't feel shit, 'cause he's coked up all the motherfucking time!

1640
01:24:24,25 --> 01:24:27,43
要是你没收到你那份的话 应该去找警察总长谈
He's your driver. Get rid of him.

1641
01:24:27,57 --> 01:24:30,86
哪份是我的? 你他妈都不认识我

You mean like the game?

1676
01:26:17,91 --> 01:26:21,54
No, I just think monopolies were made illegal in the country, Frank,

1677
01:26:19,96 --> 01:26:22,81
还有很多表兄弟

1678

都住在这里 新泽西周围
'cause nobody wants to compete, you know.

1679

That's why the price we pay for that gallon of milk

1687
01:26:47,28 --> 01:26:49,03
could never represent the true cost of production

1688
01:26:48,94 --> 01:26:52,83
Huey Lucas在Bergen县开着一家汽修厂
'cause it's got to be controlled. It's gotta be set. It's gotta be fair.

1689
01:26:52,87 --> 01:26:54,79
- 你们经理在么? - 价钱就这样了
Gotta be controlled by who? I set a price that I think is fair.

1690
01:26:54,83 --> 01:26:55,92
那我去别处修了

1691
01:26:55,96 --> 01:27:01,88
这些都是Frank分销毒品和收钱的地方
-I don't think it's fair. -You don't?

1692
01:26:57,75 --> 01:26:59,21
-I don't think it's fair. -I think it's fair.

bunch of fucking junkies that they are.

1695
01:27:04,26 --> 01:27:08,76
But we fellow dairy farmers out here, Frank, are you thinking of us?

早上5点就起床
You thinking of them?

I'm thinking of them, Dominic, about as much as they've ever thought about me.

1699

1700
01:27:21,90 --> 01:27:27,66
就算出去 也只是和他的新婚妻子以及一些球星,朋友,歌星一起 光顾一两家俱乐部或者是那么几家餐厅
If you took some of your inventory, Frank, and you sold it wholesale...

1701
01:27:27,70 --> 01:27:33,66
从不和任何犯罪分子走在一起
Sit.

1702
01:27:29,45 --> 01:27:32,79
We could work. We could do some distribution.

1703
01:27:33,83 --> 01:27:36,88
周日 他会带母亲去教堂
I don't know. I'm pretty good, Dominic.

1704
01:27:36,92 --> 01:27:39,96
然后带一束新鲜的花到Bumpy的墓上
You know, I got 110th, 155th, river to river. I'm all right.

1705
01:27:40,00 --> 01:27:40,72
每个周日 风雨无阻
That's kind of a mom and pop store next to what I'm talking about.

1706
01:27:43,76 --> 01:27:47,76
Richie,这听上去可不像大毒枭的日常生活
I mean, let's go at least bigger than Kmart.

1707
01:27:44,47 --> 01:27:49,35
I'm talking about LA, Chicago, Detroit, Las Vegas. Let's go nationwide, huh?

1708
01:27:47,80 --> 01:27:51,77
是不像,不过从Bumpy Johnson的日常生活也看不出他是黑帮大哥 不过他却控制了哈林区很多年

1709
01:27:49,81 --> 01:27:54,19
I'm gonna guarantee you your peace of mind here. You don't want that?

1710
01:27:51,80 --> 01:27:54,94
你是说Frank Lucas取代了Bumpy Johnson?

1711
01:27:54,98 --> 01:27:56,77
- 没错 - 他的司机?
You're going to need it.

1712
01:27:56,81 --> 01:27:57,74
是的
I don't know how you view me, you know.

1713
01:27:57,77 --> 01:28:00,69
- 这个速度也太快了点 - 没错 Frank就是这样

1714
01:28:00,73 --> 01:28:03,74
- 因为他所的每一件事 - 他们在分发火鸡呢
I'm kind of a Renaissance man, Frank.

1715
01:28:01,61 --> 01:28:03,58
You know, the people I deal with on a daily basis,

1716
01:28:03,78 --> 01:28:05,86
都和Bumpy的手法一样
you know, they're not enlightened, Frank.

1717
01:28:05,90 --> 01:28:08,34
你觉得Bumpy会向谁传授这些呢?
You talk to them about civil rights, they don't know, you know.

1718
01:28:08,38 --> 01:28:10,78
必然是某个和他朝夕相处的人
They're not open to change.

1719
01:28:10,83 --> 01:28:13,79
就像西西里家族一样
Not from the way things are done and who's doing it.

1720
01:28:13,83 --> 01:28:17,79
同样的结构和组织形式 给他们提供同样的保护
I talk to them, there's just no misunderstandings.

1721
01:28:17,83 --> 01:28:19,92
如果他和Bumpy在一起待了这么长时间
And that's what I mean by your peace of mind.

1722
01:28:19,95 --> 01:28:21,80
就表示他也和意大利人相处的时间也很长

1723
01:28:21,84 --> 01:28:24,76
绝对长到能够学这么多东西

1724
01:28:24,80 --> 01:28:25,92
但有一个问题

1725
01:28:25,97 --> 01:28:29,64
我觉得我们要抓的不是Frank Lucas
You're paying, what, $75,000, $80,000 a kilo?

1726
01:28:29,68 --> 01:28:34,73
我们要抓的是Lucas背后的那个人 那个把海洛因运进来的人

1727
01:28:31,69 --> 01:28:33,82
I'm a Renaissance man, too.

1728
01:28:34,76 --> 01:28:35,89
好吧
I'll consider $50,000.

1729
01:28:35,93 --> 01:28:41,90
那你有什么针对他的证据 是在法庭上拿得出手的么? 这些不够

1730
01:28:42,82 --> 01:28:46,82
没有人证物证的话 没人会去坐牢的

1731
01:28:46,86 --> 01:28:49,66
我明白 长官 但我觉得
Why would you trust these people? And the way they look at you...

1732
01:28:49,70 --> 01:28:53,70
家族内部的线人我们是找不到了
They look at me like it's Christmas and I'm Santa Claus.

1733
01:28:51,38 --> 01:28:53,88
They look at us like we're the help.

1734
01:28:53,74 --> 01:28:57,71
除非我们非常非常走运
They work for me now.

1735
01:29:02,84 --> 01:29:04,80
好!
I predict that when I meet Joe Frazier,

1736
01:29:01,81 --> 01:29:03,85
I predict that when I meet Joe Frazier,

1737
01:29:04,84 --> 01:29:06,80
看起来真美味
this will be like a good amateur fighting a real professional:

1738
01:29:08,40 --> 01:29:10,90
This will be like a kid out of the Olympics:::

1739
01:29:11,03 --> 01:29:13,36
That's gonna be Ali in like three.

1740
01:29:13,49 --> 01:29:15,53
You're not fighting Oscar Bonavena,

1741
01:29:15,66 --> 01:29:16,95
you're not fighting Sonny Liston:

1742
01:29:17,07 --> 01:29:18,08
You're fighting Joe Frazier:

1743
01:29:18,20 --> 01:29:19,83
ALl: Everybody knows that: That's not the point:

1744
01:29:19,95 --> 01:29:21,25
He's all talk, man.

1745
01:29:21,37 --> 01:29:23,62
Look at Frazier! Ali gonna crush him, baby.

1746
01:29:23,75 --> 01:29:24,75
ALl: I'll stop him:

1747
01:29:24,87 --> 01:29:26,13
Stop me? You?

1748
01:29:26,25 --> 01:29:27,50
How soon? What round?

1749
01:29:27,63 --> 01:29:31,13
Don't let him obligate you: ALl: One to 10!

1750
01:29:31,26 --> 01:29:36,10
Tonight, March 8, 1971: Here we are at Madison Square Garden

1751
01:29:36,22 --> 01:29:37,68
for the Fight of the Century:

1752
01:29:37,81 --> 01:29:40,98
And by anybody's definition, this is a happening:

1753
01:29:41,10 --> 01:29:45,52
There are handshakes and, of course, there are utterly beautiful women:

1754
01:29:45,65 --> 01:29:47,78
But behind the smiles and behind the handshakes,

1755
01:29:47,90 --> 01:29:52,53
you can feel the atmosphere is so heavy with tension, it's almost unbearable:

1756
01:29:50,46 --> 01:29:52,85
大家来牵起手

1757
01:29:52,99 --> 01:29:55,28
Everybody who is anybody is here:

1758
01:29:55,89 --> 01:30:00,85
感谢主赐予我们食物及营养
Like Sinatra: Like Graziano, David Frost and Diahann Carroll:

1759
01:29:59,33 --> 01:30:03,13
And Woody Allen and Diane Keaton: The celebrities are pouring in:

1760
01:30:00,89 --> 01:30:04,86
他的恩惠满足我们的灵魂,感谢主耶稣

1761
01:30:03,25 --> 01:30:07,34
ALl: The way you all build it up, Life magazine cover, Time magazine,

1762
01:30:05,89 --> 01:30:07,82
- 阿们 - 阿们!

1763
01:30:07,46 --> 01:30:11,47
everybody gives their opinion: Dempsey says I'll lose: Joe Louis:::

1764
01:30:11,59 --> 01:30:14,97
And when Joe Louis said I'm gonna lose, that's how I knew I'd won this one:

1765
01:30:15,10 --> 01:30:18,06
Joe Louis always picks the wrong man!

1766
01:30:18,19 --> 01:30:20,27
Always picks the wrong man:

1767
01:30:20,40 --> 01:30:23,32
Joe Louis is here tonight: Watch your ass:

1768
01:30:23,44 --> 01:30:26,82
The official weight of Joe Frazier is 205:5 pounds:

1769
01:30:27,92 --> 01:30:29,38
没事的
Oh.

1770
01:30:30,42 --> 01:30:32,59
来吧
ALl: Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee:

1771
01:30:32,62 --> 01:30:34,73
没事的
You're not watching the fight, Bob?

1772
01:30:34,76 --> 01:30:37,89
- 你最好扔准一点 - 你扔过来就是了
I'm not into boxing.

1773
01:30:37,93 --> 01:30:40,69
- 来吧 - 准备好了 老家伙
This ain't boxing, kid.

1774
01:30:40,73 --> 01:30:43,81
- 来投吧来投吧 - 好了好了
It's politics.

1775
01:30:43,85 --> 01:30:46,82
小心我打你个落花流水

1776
01:30:46,86 --> 01:30:49,82
别废话了 快扔过来吧
I got something for you, too.

1777
01:30:48,01 --> 01:30:49,47
Yeah?

1778
01:30:52,90 --> 01:30:56,70
Steve 过来
The coat? For me?

1779
01:30:53,89 --> 01:30:54,98
Mmm-hmm.

1780
01:30:56,74 --> 01:30:57,74
坐下
Do you like it?

1781
01:30:57,78 --> 01:30:58,85
Frank叔叔
The coat? Yeah, yeah, it's nice.

1782
01:30:58,88 --> 01:30:59,91
怎么了?

1783
01:30:59,95 --> 01:31:01,75
你还好么?

1784
01:31:01,78 --> 01:31:02,84
不错啊
-What do you think? -Yeah.

1785
01:31:02,87 --> 01:31:04,71
要喝一口么?

1786
01:31:04,75 --> 01:31:09,80
- 你知道我不喝的 - 考验一下你
-You sure? -Yeah.

1787
01:31:09,84 --> 01:31:13,80
那次见面你为什么没去?

1788
01:31:13,84 --> 01:31:17,93
我说过会有洋基队的人来 还有Billy Martin
Over here, Sammy.

1789
01:31:15,58 --> 01:31:17,96
Hey, Sammy! Give a look.

1790
01:31:17,97 --> 01:31:22,68
为什么没去?

1791
01:31:20,05 --> 01:31:21,46
Joe Louis! Over here!

1792
01:31:22,73 --> 01:31:24,94
别骗我
How's it going, Frank?

1793
01:31:23,01 --> 01:31:24,55
How are you, Joe?

1794
01:31:24,98 --> 01:31:27,94
我不想再打棒球了

1795
01:31:27,98 --> 01:31:28,83
已经决定了

1796
01:31:29,18 --> 01:31:31,86
你说什么决定了? 决定什么了?

1797
01:31:31,90 --> 01:31:33,87
- 那不是我想要的 - 你说什么呢?

1798
01:31:33,90 --> 01:31:37,66
你从小就喜欢打棒球 还说以后要做职业选手
Now, ladies and gentlemen, we have quite a list of introductions:

1799
01:31:37,70 --> 01:31:38,24
Frank
We are now going to introduce people from all endeavours of life:

1800
01:31:38,38 --> 01:31:40,79
出问题了

1801
01:31:42,82 --> 01:31:43,84
你想要什么?

1802
01:31:45,87 --> 01:31:48,79
想要你所拥有的 Frank叔叔
And not just show people:

1803
01:31:46,87 --> 01:31:49,87
Because everyone is here tonight!

1804
01:31:48,83 --> 01:31:50,76
我想成为你

1805
01:32:01,97 --> 01:32:03,60
Main event!

1806
01:32:05,81 --> 01:32:07,60
Fifteen rounds:

1807
01:32:07,72 --> 01:32:12,77
For the undisputed Heavyweight Championship of the World!

1808
01:32:12,90 --> 01:32:13,94
There we go, Ali!

1809
01:32:14,07 --> 01:32:17,61
From Louisville, Kentucky, he's wearing red trunks:

1810
01:32:17,74 --> 01:32:19,07
Champ! This is Frank Lucas.

1811
01:32:19,20 --> 01:32:21,11
He weighs 215 pounds:

1812
01:32:22,32 --> 01:32:25,95
Here is Muhammad Ali!

1813
01:32:27,25 --> 01:32:31,29
His opponent, from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,

1814
01:32:31,75 --> 01:32:34,00
he's wearing green trunks:

1815
01:32:33,84 --> 01:32:36,84
朋友
Who's that laughing with Cattano?

1816
01:32:36,88 --> 01:32:38,97
- 欢迎 Frank - 你好么 Nicky?
How'd he get so fucking close to the ring?

1817
01:32:39,00 --> 01:32:41,85
很好 欢迎
The Heavyweight Champion of the World,

1818
01:32:41,89 --> 01:32:42,93
我要和你谈谈
Joe Frazier!

1819
01:32:42,97 --> 01:32:44,77
好啊 来吧

1820
01:32:46,21 --> 01:32:50,90
一切都很好 Nicky 大家都很开心 Charlie 意大利人

1821
01:32:47,85 --> 01:32:51,19
Hey, Frank. You gonna keep that hat on all night?

1822
01:32:50,93 --> 01:32:53,87
除了你
I'm gonna miss the fight.

1823
01:32:53,90 --> 01:32:58,78
我不明白 你为什么一定要
You paid for it.

1824
01:32:58,82 --> 01:33:00,21
搞砸原本好端端的东西呢?
Joe, over here!

1825
01:33:00,74 --> 01:33:03,83
牌子 创牌子可不容易

1826
01:33:03,86 --> 01:33:06,75
都他妈给我闭嘴!

1827
01:33:06,79 --> 01:33:09,75
请继续Frank 这个我很抱歉

1828
01:33:09,79 --> 01:33:15,76
蓝色魔法 是个牌子 和百事一样 是个牌子

1829
01:33:15,80 --> 01:33:18,72
这牌子是我支持的 我打的包票

1830
01:33:18,76 --> 01:33:21,80
他们知道这点

1831
01:33:21,84 --> 01:33:23,76
就算他们都不认识我了他们也会记得General Mills(著名食品品牌)的董事长

1832
01:33:23,81 --> 01:33:24,89
你他妈说什么呢?

1833
01:33:24,93 --> 01:33:30,85
我是说你把我的货降低纯度后出售 还冠以蓝色魔法

1834
01:33:30,89 --> 01:33:32,74
的名字

1835
01:33:32,77 --> 01:33:35,82
那就变成法国人的注册商标了 你明白我说的么?

1836
01:33:35,86 --> 01:33:38,86
恕我直言 Frank 但我买了东西 就是我的了

1837
01:33:38,90 --> 01:33:41,91
- 这是没错 - 我想怎么叫就可以怎么叫
This guy, he's a supplier at most: Or just a pimp:

1838
01:33:41,95 --> 01:33:44,70
但你用不着这样啊 我是想说
Otherwise we'd know his name:

1839
01:33:42,75 --> 01:33:46,54
His tickets were phenomenal. Better seats than Dominic Cattano. Right?

1840
01:33:44,74 --> 01:33:45,91
现在这样就可以了

1841
01:33:45,95 --> 01:33:49,71
你叫它蓝色魔法但保持货的成色不变 也照样可以赚大钱
Joe Louis shook his hand.

1842
01:33:49,75 --> 01:33:51,71
除此之外的任何改变都是贪婪的举动 孩子
Who the fuck is this guy?

1843
01:33:51,75 --> 01:33:53,75
那你想怎么样 Frank? 要我换个名字?

1844
01:33:53,79 --> 01:33:55,75
我恐怕要要求你改名字了

1845
01:33:55,80 --> 01:33:59,76
没问题 Frank 那我就改叫红色魔法 只不过没那么好听了
What's this?

1846
01:33:57,60 --> 01:33:59,77
That's the plate off the limo.

1847
01:33:59,80 --> 01:34:02,76
你取什么名字我并不在乎 你想怎么叫都可以
Check with the company who rented it.

1848
01:34:02,80 --> 01:34:04,93
叫蓝色狗屎都没问题 你明白么?

1849
01:34:04,97 --> 01:34:09,77
我不在乎 只要你别再让我抓到你这样就行
Right there, Mr Lucas. Right there. Good.

1850
01:34:09,80 --> 01:34:11,94
抓到我? 触犯? 坚持?
Can I get a shot here, Frank? Right here.

1851
01:34:12,69 --> 01:34:14,86
我可不喜欢这些字眼
Looking good, Frank.

1852
01:34:14,90 --> 01:34:17,78
请 谢谢 不好意思打扰你了Nicky 这些我才喜欢
Beautiful.

1853
01:34:17,81 --> 01:34:20,65
你这么不请自来地冲到我的俱乐部 就和我说这些?
Right on, Frank!

1854
01:34:20,70 --> 01:34:22,74
听见了么?
Congratulations!

1855
01:34:22,78 --> 01:34:24,75
伙计

1856
01:34:26,84 --> 01:34:28,72
She's the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.

1857
01:34:28,84 --> 01:34:32,43
That's my sunshine right there, Mr Williams. I wish Bumpy had met her.

1858
01:34:32,79 --> 01:34:34,63
该死
Throw it to me!

1859
01:34:34,67 --> 01:34:36,63
后面的是警察么?

1860
01:34:38,85 --> 01:34:40,35
Get a picture.

1861
01:34:47,76 --> 01:34:50,73
没事,他们能干什么,给我们开发单?

1862
01:34:50,76 --> 01:34:53,05
东西在车里呢 Frank
Come here, baby.

1863
01:34:53,90 --> 01:34:56,78
- 什么? - 有一些在后备箱里呢

1864
01:34:59,82 --> 01:35:01,78
- 近来怎么样 Frank? - 挺不错的 警探

1865
01:35:01,82 --> 01:35:02,95
感恩节过得好么?

1866
01:35:02,98 --> 01:35:05,91
说实话不怎么样 出来

1867
01:35:10,95 --> 01:35:13,71
- 钥匙给我 - Shelby在哪呢?

1868
01:35:13,74 --> 01:35:15,83
- 走了 - 真的?

1869
01:35:15,88 --> 01:35:18,84
- 是 长官 - 这里
-What's happening? Sit tight.

1870
01:35:18,88 --> 01:35:20,88
这里头有违禁品么?

1871
01:35:20,92 --> 01:35:22,82
那个是Trupo
Congratulations, Frank.

1872
01:35:22,86 --> 01:35:24,72
- 是他? - 是的
Detective.

1873
01:35:24,75 --> 01:35:25,94
是那个混帐
So, you sure you done the right thing? I mean, she's a beautiful girl and all...

1874
01:35:27,97 --> 01:35:30,73
- 过来一下 Frank - 是
Hey, hey, listen, listen.

1875
01:35:30,66 --> 01:35:32,71
Before you say anything about me or about my wife,

1876
01:35:33,76 --> 01:35:34,86
这个我们要怎么处理?
understand this is the most important day of my life, Detective.

1877
01:35:34,90 --> 01:35:39,86
不怎么 把包拉上 放回后厢 大家回家吃点南瓜派吧
Oh, I understand. I understand.

1878
01:35:37,08 --> 01:35:39,55
You know, a man who walks around in a $50,000 chinchilla coat

1879
01:35:39,90 --> 01:35:42,20
我有个更好的主意
and never even bought me a cup of coffee.

1880
01:35:42,24 --> 01:35:46,20
你想让我把你和你兄弟给扔河里去么?
There's something wrong there. Pay your bills, Frank?

1881
01:35:46,64 --> 01:35:49,87
你想让自己家的房子下次被炸飞么?
I don't know what you're talking about.

1882
01:35:47,93 --> 01:35:48,93
Do you pay your bills, I asked you?

1883
01:35:49,06 --> 01:35:50,14
If you're not getting your share,

1884
01:35:50,27 --> 01:35:51,60
maybe you need to talk to the Chief of Police.

1885
01:35:52,87 --> 01:35:56,84
- 我喜欢这辆车 - 我知道
What's my share? 'Cause you don't even fucking know me.

1886
01:35:55,86 --> 01:35:57,15
Maybe I'm special.

1887
01:35:57,27 --> 01:35:59,07
You are special.

1888
01:35:59,75 --> 01:36:00,88
他在干嘛?
You see that right there?

1889
01:36:00,92 --> 01:36:02,85
拍下来
Special Investigations Unit.

1890
01:36:02,88 --> 01:36:06,44
- 有人要从慈善基金拿钱了 - 明白

1891
01:36:04,45 --> 01:36:05,70
Special.

1892
01:36:06,89 --> 01:36:07,81
真抱歉 Frank
Get it?

1893
01:36:08,84 --> 01:36:10,73
别说了 上车吧
Ten grand. First of each month. Deliver it right here.

1894
01:36:13,63 --> 01:36:16,13
-Are you done? -Oh, yeah, I'm done.

1895
01:36:19,22 --> 01:36:22,34
Don't forget your card. Have a nice fucking honeymoon.

1896
01:36:22,47 --> 01:36:23,72
Let's go.

1897
01:36:27,70 --> 01:36:30,66
没用的家伙!

1898
01:36:33,95 --> 01:36:34,79
好 待会打给我

1899
01:36:37,83 --> 01:36:41,60
INS IRS FBI 我从他们那里一点东西都得不到

1900
01:36:41,84 --> 01:36:46,85
因为他们觉得你打电话时录了音 而你觉得他们录了音

1901
01:36:46,88 --> 01:36:51,93
我觉得他们似乎并不希望这一切停止 他们手下那么多人

1902
01:36:51,97 --> 01:36:56,81
法官 律师 警察 政客 狱卒

1903
01:36:56,85 --> 01:36:58,24
假释官员

1904
01:36:58,98 --> 01:37:01,94
要是毒品进口一停 到时候会有数十万人失业的

1905
01:37:15,83 --> 01:37:17,66
微波是个什么鬼东西?

1906
01:37:17,71 --> 01:37:21,79
- 是一种类似于原子能的新技术 - 是么

1907
01:37:21,83 --> 01:37:22,80
没错

1908
01:37:22,84 --> 01:37:25,84
- 能改变分子排列 - 什么的分子?
His name is Frank Lucas:

1909
01:37:25,87 --> 01:37:30,84
比如爆米花的
Originally from Greensboro, North Carolina:

1910
01:37:28,04 --> 01:37:33,05
A couple of arrests years ago. Gambling and unlicensed firearm.

1911
01:37:30,89 --> 01:37:36,65
来吧 来吧

1912
01:37:33,38 --> 01:37:37,76
For 15 years, he was Bumpy Johnson's driver, bodyguard and collector.

1913
01:37:36,68 --> 01:37:38,73
我可以给你弄一台

1914
01:37:38,76 --> 01:37:40,35
全新的 和这台一样
He was with him when he died.

1915
01:37:40,39 --> 01:37:41,94
到时候给你送过去
He's got five brothers. He's the oldest. And a lot of cousins.

1916
01:37:41,98 --> 01:37:47,95
不用了 谢谢

1917
01:37:47,44 --> 01:37:48,48
They all living up here now,

1918
01:37:48,61 --> 01:37:51,44
spread throughout the five boroughs and Jersey.

1919
01:37:51,57 --> 01:37:53,78
The brothers are Dexter,

1920
01:37:53,99 --> 01:37:57,89
- 这是哪里? - Aspen 我们刚从那儿回来
-in Brooklyn: He's a dry cleaner: -What can I do for you?

1921
01:37:56,24 --> 01:37:58,87
-I'm picking up. Yeah:

1922
01:37:57,93 --> 01:38:01,79
- 玩得很开心 知道我认识谁了么? - 谁?
Melvin in Queens has got a custom furniture and fire doors business:

1923
01:38:01,83 --> 01:38:03,79
Burt Reynolds

1924
01:38:03,83 --> 01:38:05,75
- 是么? - 是啊
-That's it right here? -Right there.

1925
01:38:05,80 --> 01:38:07,80
- 真的?! - 不开玩笑
Terrence in Newark, he has a hardware store:

1926
01:38:07,84 --> 01:38:10,80
很多好莱坞明星现在都去那 什么都买

1927
01:38:11,24 --> 01:38:13,30
这是你的房子?
Turner in the Bronx has got a tyre shop:

1928
01:38:13,34 --> 01:38:14,76
很值啊
And Huey Lucas in Bergen County has a body shop:

1929
01:38:14,81 --> 01:38:17,73
什么时候都可以滑雪 五个房间 有桑拿 什么都有了

1930
01:38:16,93 --> 01:38:18,68
-Is your manager here? -That's my price.

1931
01:38:18,76 --> 01:38:20,69
过得简直像活神仙
Oh, man, I'm gonna take it somewhere else, all right?

1932
01:38:20,52 --> 01:38:23,65
These businesses are the distribution and collection points

1933
01:38:24,77 --> 01:38:27,74
是你的地方
for Frank's dope and Frank's money:

1934
01:38:26,82 --> 01:38:32,32
Everything about Frank's life seems unpretentious, orderly and legitimate.

1935
01:38:33,07 --> 01:38:35,58
He starts early, gets up at 5:00 a: M:

1936
01:38:35,70 --> 01:38:39,50
Has breakfast in a diner in Harlem every morning, usually by himself:

1937
01:38:39,62 --> 01:38:40,62
Then he starts work:

1938
01:38:41,87 --> 01:38:44,92
只要你做些事
Takes a meeting with the accountant or with his lawyer:

1939
01:38:44,29 --> 01:38:47,51
At nights, he usually stays at home: And if he does go out,

1940
01:38:45,96 --> 01:38:48,67
放老大一马

1941
01:38:47,63 --> 01:38:51,68
it's to one of two clubs or a handful of restaurants with his new wife:

1942
01:38:49,72 --> 01:38:51,68
你知道我说的是谁

1943
01:38:51,72 --> 01:38:54,85
我要是把你刚才说的话报告上去 你就会有麻烦的
-Some ball players: -That's fucking Wilt Chamberlain.

1944
01:38:54,89 --> 01:38:57,86
我会这么做的 到时候你就要吃不了兜着走
Friends, musicians: Never, never with organised crime guys:

1945
01:38:58,14 --> 01:39:00,90
Sundays, he takes his mother to church:

1946
01:38:59,89 --> 01:39:01,24
希望你不要这么做

1947
01:39:01,44 --> 01:39:02,94
Then he drives out and he changes

1948
01:39:02,98 --> 01:39:04,88
Richie 拜托 我又没有在录音
the flowers on Bumpy's grave. Every Sunday, no matter what.

1949
01:39:05,91 --> 01:39:07,74
我这么做是因为我们是朋友

1950
01:39:08,78 --> 01:39:11,74
- 而且我跟你说 这个条件真的很好 - 谁提的? 你叔叔?
Not the typical day in the life of a dope man, Richie:

1951
01:39:10,91 --> 01:39:11,95
No:

1952
01:39:12,08 --> 01:39:15,91
Bumpy Johnson's life wasn't typical either, and he ran Harlem for years:

1953
01:39:16,95 --> 01:39:18,70
你为什么要这么做?
So you're saying that Frank Lucas replaced Bumpy Johnson?

1954
01:39:18,74 --> 01:39:20,92
- 为什么要拿我们的友谊冒险? - 因为...
Yeah: His driver?

1955
01:39:21,21 --> 01:39:23,76
Yeah: Sounds a little farfetched:

1956
01:39:22,96 --> 01:39:24,75
我关心你
But is it? Is it? Because everything he does:::

1957
01:39:27,79 --> 01:39:29,80
你不该这么做
He's handing out turkeys, man.

1958
01:39:27,84 --> 01:39:30,18
:: He does the same as Bumpy would have done, right?

1959
01:39:29,84 --> 01:39:32,80
我必须这么做 没别的选择 你也没有 Richie..
And who was Bumpy most likely to teach?

1960
01:39:33,84 --> 01:39:37,05
你没有别的选择 别碰Frank Lucas!
The guy he sees every day.

1961
01:39:35,69 --> 01:39:37,94
It's like a Sicilian family:

1962
01:39:38,88 --> 01:39:40,81
Frank Lucas?
He's structured his organisation to protect him in the same way.

1963
01:39:41,84 --> 01:39:44,94
是啊
And if he was with Bumpy for so long,

1964
01:39:44,98 --> 01:39:47,17
告诉Maria我得走了 很抱歉
that means he would have spent a lot of time with Italians.

1965
01:39:46,49 --> 01:39:49,24
Definitely long enough to learn that much.

1966
01:39:48,81 --> 01:39:49,74
告诉她为什么
But here's the thing. I don't think it's Frank Lucas that we're after.

1967
01:39:53,75 --> 01:39:56,71
Who we want is whoever Frank Lucas is working for.

1968
01:39:56,83 --> 01:39:58,84
It's whoever's actually bringing the heroin in.

1969
01:39:58,96 --> 01:40:05,55
Okay. So what do you have on him that will stick in court? Because this isn't it.

1970
01:40:07,06 --> 01:40:10,85
Without powder, without informants, no one's going to jail.

1971
01:40:11,35 --> 01:40:12,52
That's understood, sir.

1972
01:40:12,64 --> 01:40:13,90
And I don't think we're gonna get informants, not from inside the family,

1973
01:40:15,36 --> 01:40:17,61
And I don't think we're gonna get informants, not from inside the family,

1974
01:40:17,73 --> 01:40:19,61
you know, unless we get very, very lucky.

1975
01:40:22,53 --> 01:40:27,33
Straight up lab tests suggesting purity's consistent with Asian dope.

1976
01:40:28,37 --> 01:40:31,42
The Italians, we know, usually work with other Europeans

1977
01:40:31,54 --> 01:40:33,46
or with the Turks.

1978
01:40:33,69 --> 01:40:34,90
- 你干什么? - 别开枪!
We got small blue packets turning up in neighbourhoods all over the Tri-State area.

1979
01:40:34,95 --> 01:40:35,82
你是Richie Roberts么?

1980
01:40:35,86 --> 01:40:37,00
是的 怎么?

1981
01:40:38,74 --> 01:40:40,71
有你的传票 对不起
From Chinatown, to Harlem, Washington Heights

1982
01:40:42,51 --> 01:40:44,64
Richmond Avenue and Staten Island.

1983
01:40:44,76 --> 01:40:47,56
They got North Orange, Princeton, Bayonne, Newark,

1984
01:40:48,60 --> 01:40:52,19
Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo, and all the way through Connecticut.

1985
01:40:52,31 --> 01:40:54,23
The same dope.

1986
01:40:59,89 --> 01:41:02,94
Laurie..

1987
01:41:02,97 --> 01:41:06,89
很抱歉我一直没能给你你想要的生活
That's it, down there.

1988
01:41:06,93 --> 01:41:08,70
道歉是远远不够的

1989
01:41:11,73 --> 01:41:18,70
但别因为我是个诚实的人而惩罚我 别把孩子带走

1990
01:41:19,24 --> 01:41:25,70
你说什么呢? 你觉得我离开你 是因为你不像别的警察那样收钱?

1991
01:41:23,52 --> 01:41:25,39
And it's Three Counts as they round the turn for home now:

1992
01:41:26,21 --> 01:41:28,87
不 你不收钱只有一个原因

1993
01:41:28,92 --> 01:41:31,23
这样你在生活中的其他所有事情上 才可以不用那么诚实

1994
01:41:31,96 --> 01:41:34,88
那可比收钱这种没人在乎的事情更糟

1995
01:41:34,91 --> 01:41:37,28
那些交了也没人可惜的 贩毒 赌博得来的钱

1996
01:41:37,81 --> 01:41:40,64
我倒宁可你去收钱 然后对我诚实

1997
01:41:41,68 --> 01:41:44,72
或者不收也行 我不在乎 但是不要对不起我

1998
01:41:44,76 --> 01:41:46,23
也不要对不起你的孩子 你从来都不在他身边

1999
01:41:46,37 --> 01:41:50,69
不要在外面和你那些情人啊 秘书啊脱衣舞女啊的鬼混

2000
01:41:48,88 --> 01:41:51,05
Okay, let's all join hands.

2001
01:41:50,73 --> 01:41:53,94
我看得出她就是其中之一

2002
01:41:53,98 --> 01:41:57,78
你觉得因为你诚实就能上天堂?
Lord, we thank You for this food we're about to receive,

2003
01:41:57,81 --> 01:41:58,95
但你并不诚实!
the nourishments of our bodies.

2004
01:41:58,99 --> 01:42:00,95
你会和那些你无法忍受的烂警察们一起下地狱的
Feed our souls with heavenly grace, in Jesus' name and for His sake.

2005
01:42:02,99 --> 01:42:04,91
全体起立

2006
01:42:05,15 --> 01:42:06,86
-Amen. Amen.

2007
01:42:08,96 --> 01:42:10,44
请坐

2008
01:42:11,47 --> 01:42:13,92
Digerson小姐

2009
01:42:13,96 --> 01:42:16,88
法庭做出结论之前

2010
01:42:16,92 --> 01:42:19,80
你还有什么要补充的么?

2011
01:42:19,84 --> 01:42:21,68
是的 法官大人

2012
01:42:21,72 --> 01:42:23,89
大人 今天这里已经说了很多

2013
01:42:23,93 --> 01:42:26,19
Roberts先生所居住的环境 对他的孩子的成长有多么不利

2014
01:42:26,43 --> 01:42:27,87
有多么危险
Shh. Shh.

2015
01:42:28,41 --> 01:42:30,81
我们让他来保护我们
Hey, it's okay. It's okay. Come on, now.

2016
01:42:30,85 --> 01:42:34,94
我们让他承担这样的责任 但却不信任他来养育一个孩子
It's okay.

2017
01:42:34,98 --> 01:42:36,40
我们却认为他不适合做这样的事
-You better get yourself ready, old man. -Come on, big man. Throw the ball.

2018
01:42:36,94 --> 01:42:38,90
我确实不适合
Get yourself ready, old man. All right!

2019
01:42:38,94 --> 01:42:41,87
你说得对

2020
01:42:41,51 --> 01:42:43,31
我没有办法来照顾孩子
Come on, now. Your pop said you had an arm on you. Come on!

2021
01:42:44,34 --> 01:42:47,71
你带他去拉斯维加斯吧 有空的时候我会去看他的
I'm gonna set your ass in the grass, Uncle Melvin.

2022
01:42:46,53 --> 01:42:49,03
Hey! Watch your mouth, boy. Throw the ball!

2023
01:42:49,20 --> 01:42:51,95
Damn, Uncle Melvin, I'm a pitcher, not an outfielder!

2024
01:42:50,83 --> 01:42:52,80
法官大人 抱歉我要离庭
Steve. Steve, come here.

2025
01:42:55,45 --> 01:42:56,41
Come, sit down.

2026
01:42:56,58 --> 01:42:58,87
Uncle Frank. What's happening?

2027
01:42:59,71 --> 01:43:01,00
How you doing?

2028
01:43:01,17 --> 01:43:02,13
Cool.

2029
01:43:02,29 --> 01:43:03,54
You want a drink?

2030
01:43:03,71 --> 01:43:05,26
You know better than that.

2031
01:43:06,18 --> 01:43:07,85
Doc
Just checking.

2032
01:43:07,89 --> 01:43:10,85
- 我看见了 - 那儿呢
Why didn't you show up for that meeting, Steve?

2033
01:43:13,18 --> 01:43:16,27
I set it up with the Yankees and Billy Martin.

2034
01:43:18,19 --> 01:43:20,15
Why didn't you show up?

2035
01:43:22,57 --> 01:43:24,19
Don't lie to me.

2036
01:43:24,78 --> 01:43:27,24
I don't want to play ball no more.

2037
01:43:27,86 --> 01:43:28,91
-I decided. -What you talking about?

2038
01:43:29,79 --> 01:43:32,83
他过来干什么?
You decided? Decided what?

2039
01:43:31,20 --> 01:43:32,99
-That ain't what I want. -What you talking about?

2040
01:43:32,87 --> 01:43:33,84
香槟?
You've been playing since you was a little boy.

2041
01:43:33,87 --> 01:43:35,88
- 圣诞快乐 警探们 - 给我们的?
You were ready to go into the pros. What you...

2042
01:43:35,91 --> 01:43:36,84
好好享受吧
Frank! We got a problem, man.

2043
01:43:37,88 --> 01:43:38,84
祝你们愉快

2044
01:43:42,05 --> 01:43:43,67
What do you want?

2045
01:43:45,26 --> 01:43:47,68
I want what you got, Uncle Frank.

2046
01:43:47,84 --> 01:43:49,47
I want to be you.

2047
01:43:53,89 --> 01:43:59,86
给条子钱是一码事,我从10岁起就开始给警察交钱了 我给他们孩子的钱比学校的奖学金多多了

2048
01:44:03,95 --> 01:44:05,82
那个给我

2049
01:44:05,86 --> 01:44:07,87
不过这次是另外一码事

2050
01:44:07,91 --> 01:44:11,83
特别调查组的问题就在于 他们觉得自己真的有多特别
He's been diluting it so much. We're down 2%, 3% pure.

2051
01:44:11,86 --> 01:44:14,75
- 都是一群烂警察,毫无道德观念 - 你怎么想?
And you tested it? You're sure?

2052
01:44:15,19 --> 01:44:17,88
很好 很漂亮
Yeah.

2053
01:44:17,92 --> 01:44:18,80
不错

2054
01:44:19,24 --> 01:44:22,76
我最不用担心的人就是条子 我见过太多不认识的的人了

2055
01:44:21,42 --> 01:44:22,59
Fuck you looking at?

2056
01:44:23,80 --> 01:44:25,73
是啊 我也是

2057
01:44:30,16 --> 01:44:32,89
- 圣诞快乐 Charlie - 谢谢

2058
01:44:32,93 --> 01:44:34,81
- 爱你 - 我也爱你

2059
01:44:36,25 --> 01:44:37,90
拿着这个

2060
01:44:38,94 --> 01:44:39,90
再喝一杯 然后我就走了

2061
01:44:47,95 --> 01:44:49,96
- 我们会玩得很开心的 - 没错

2062
01:44:50,40 --> 01:44:51,75
Lucas先生,祝您今晚愉快

2063
01:44:53,79 --> 01:44:54,75
一切安全

2064
01:45:01,67 --> 01:45:02,88
- 这是谁? - Nicky在那儿

2065
01:45:03,92 --> 01:45:05,21
看到了

2066
01:45:05,34 --> 01:45:06,77
继续开

2067
01:45:07,20 --> 01:45:09,24
- 要往回开么? - 我想不用了

2068
01:45:09,68 --> 01:45:10,88
我可不想进自己的场子还要偷偷摸摸

2069
01:45:11,72 --> 01:45:12,65
难以置信

2070
01:45:15,03 --> 01:45:16,61
My man.

2071
01:45:18,40 --> 01:45:20,03
-Welcome, Frank. -How you doing, Nick?

2072
01:45:21,37 --> 01:45:23,24
It's all great. Welcome.

2073
01:45:23,37 --> 01:45:25,33
-I need to talk to you. -Great. Come on.

2074
01:45:25,45 --> 01:45:30,13
Hey, you all, everybody get out! Let's go. Come on! Hurry up!

2075
01:45:31,67 --> 01:45:34,09
Sit, my brother.

2076
01:45:36,25 --> 01:45:37,83
来吧
I take it you talked to Charlie.

2077
01:45:40,18 --> 01:45:41,84
等等
Guess you wanna hear more about my Black coalition.

2078
01:45:41,43 --> 01:45:42,93
-Let me explain to you... -No, no, no.

2079
01:45:43,06 --> 01:45:46,02
I'm all right. That's not what I came here for, Nick.

2080
01:45:47,35 --> 01:45:48,86
Yeah, everybody's good, Nick.

2081
01:45:49,31 --> 01:45:50,69
怎么?
You know, everybody's happy. Charlie, Baz, the Italians,

2082
01:45:51,32 --> 01:45:52,68
我想在车里等
you know, Johnny Law. Everybody's happy except you.

2083
01:45:52,72 --> 01:45:53,77
我去买吧 我去买

2084
01:45:54,81 --> 01:45:56,90
我来吧
-I'm happy, Frank. -You happy? Really?

2085
01:45:56,93 --> 01:45:58,24
- 记得买黄色酱的 - 黄色酱汁
Well, maybe I'm the one with the problem. Yeah, go on. Get one.

2086
01:45:58,27 --> 01:46:00,30
还有鸡肉 宫爆鸡丁

2087
01:46:00,45 --> 01:46:01,54
All right.

2088
01:46:01,91 --> 01:46:02,91
I gotta problem 'cause

2089
01:46:03,04 --> 01:46:07,38
I don't understand why you gotta take something that's perfectly good

2090
01:46:06,94 --> 01:46:08,91
能把暖气打开么?
and mess it up.

2091
01:46:09,42 --> 01:46:11,92
See, brand names. Brand names mean something. Understand?

2092
01:46:13,26 --> 01:46:14,59
Shut the fuck up!

2093
01:46:15,70 --> 01:46:17,07
该死 我去拿钥匙
Go ahead, Frank. I'm sorry about that bullshit.

2094
01:46:18,93 --> 01:46:20,27
Blue Magic.

2095
01:46:20,98 --> 01:46:24,48
That's a brand name. Like Pepsi, that's a brand name.

2096
01:46:24,60 --> 01:46:27,32
I stand behind it. I guarantee it.

2097
01:46:27,44 --> 01:46:29,57
They know that, even if they don't know me any more than

2098
01:46:30,97 --> 01:46:33,93
- Doc 把钥匙给我 - 给
they know the chairman of General Mills.

2099
01:46:32,36 --> 01:46:33,66
What the fuck are you talking about, Frank?

2100
01:46:33,78 --> 01:46:36,62
What I'm talking about is when you chop my dope down

2101
01:46:36,74 --> 01:46:41,37
to one, two, three, four, five percent and then you call it Blue Magic,

2102
01:46:39,89 --> 01:46:45,40
Doc!

2103
01:46:41,50 --> 01:46:44,63
that is trademark infringement. You understand what I'm saying?

2104
01:46:45,43 --> 01:46:47,90
趴下
With all due respect, Frank, if I buy something, I own it.

2105
01:46:47,34 --> 01:46:48,59
No, that ain't true. That ain't true.

2106
01:46:48,71 --> 01:46:50,88
If I buy a car, and I wanna paint it, I can paint the motherfucker.

2107
01:46:52,25 --> 01:46:54,78
没事吧?
Yeah, but you don't have to.

2108
01:46:52,30 --> 01:46:55,31
This is what I'm saying to you, Nick, you don't have to. Good enough the way it is.

2109
01:46:54,82 --> 01:46:55,74
没事
You can make enough money off it the way it is, just by calling it Blue Magic.

2110
01:46:55,78 --> 01:46:56,74
该死!

2111
01:46:56,98 --> 01:46:57,67
起来吧
Anything more than that is greed, son.

2112
01:46:57,70 --> 01:46:58,71
亲爱的 你没事吧?

2113
01:46:59,75 --> 01:47:00,91
我们走
What you want, Frank? You want me to change the name on it?

2114
01:47:02,23 --> 01:47:04,27
I would have to insist that you change the name.

2115
01:47:04,40 --> 01:47:08,20
Fine by me, Frank. I'll call it Red Magic, even though that don't sound as good.

2116
01:47:08,32 --> 01:47:11,20
I don't give a fuck what you call it. Put a chokehold on the motherfucker

2117
01:47:11,32 --> 01:47:13,91
and call it Blue Dog Shit, you know what I mean?

2118
01:47:14,03 --> 01:47:18,25
I don't care, just don't let me catch you doing this again.

2119
01:47:18,37 --> 01:47:21,04
Catch me? Infringement? Insist?

2120
01:47:21,17 --> 01:47:22,92
I don't like these words as much as,

2121
01:47:22,77 --> 01:47:23,86
是Nicky干的么?
"Please, thank you, I'm sorry to bother you, Nicky."

2122
01:47:25,40 --> 01:47:29,82
Frank,只要你一句话 我们现在就去毙了他
These are better words you use to come to my motherfucking club

2123
01:47:28,09 --> 01:47:30,64
without an invitation! You hear me?

2124
01:47:31,16 --> 01:47:32,91
我们得有所行动 Frank
My man.

2125
01:47:33,45 --> 01:47:36,25
- 不能就在这儿这么坐着 - 我们要离开这儿

2126
01:47:39,79 --> 01:47:41,91
- 好了 大家都先停下 - 你还好么?

2127
01:47:41,95 --> 01:47:42,42
你们都回家
Oh, shit. Fuck, is that the cops there, man?

2128
01:47:42,96 --> 01:47:44,79
今天是圣诞 你们应该和家人在一起

2129
01:47:45,13 --> 01:47:46,20
走吧 去陪孩子去

2130
01:47:53,75 --> 01:47:55,37
It's all right.

2131
01:47:56,46 --> 01:47:59,38
The hell they're gonna do, give us a ticket?

2132
01:47:59,50 --> 01:48:01,71
Stuff's in the car, Frank.

2133
01:48:01,98 --> 01:48:04,77
我们要去哪? 西班牙 还是中国?

2134
01:48:05,11 --> 01:48:07,09
先来坐下 跟我说说你想去哪儿
What?

2135
01:48:04,76 --> 01:48:06,89
Some of it's in the trunk.

2136
01:48:09,73 --> 01:48:12,30
- Frank 我们想去哪里都可以的 - 去哪里?
-How you doing, Frank? -I'm good. How you doing, Detective?

2137
01:48:10,51 --> 01:48:11,93
How was your Thanksgiving?

2138
01:48:12,33 --> 01:48:13,83
- 哪儿都行 - 什么?
Not so good, as a matter of fact. Why don't you get out of the car?

2139
01:48:14,86 --> 01:48:17,86
去干什么? 跑路? 去躲起来? Frank Lucas不会躲避任何人

2140
01:48:19,20 --> 01:48:22,66
我们哪儿也不去 就待在这里 这是我的家
Come on, give me the fucking keys.

2141
01:48:21,19 --> 01:48:23,40
-Where's the Shelby at? -The Shelby's gone, Frank.

2142
01:48:23,71 --> 01:48:26,88
我的生意在这里 我的妻子 母亲 家人 都在这里
-The Shelby's gone? -Stay right there.

2143
01:48:25,03 --> 01:48:26,91
Yes, sir. Right here.

2144
01:48:26,92 --> 01:48:29,94
这是我的国家 我哪儿也不去
You got anything worth looking at in here?

2145
01:48:29,98 --> 01:48:31,97
我不会害怕任何人
Hey, that's that Trupo guy.

2146
01:48:33,00 --> 01:48:33,93
这里是美国
Is that him? Yeah.

2147
01:48:33,21 --> 01:48:34,71
Fucking prick.

2148
01:48:37,96 --> 01:48:40,34
-Come over here a minute, Frank. -Yeah.

2149
01:48:41,93 --> 01:48:45,90
你 也不准去别的地方
What are we gonna do about this?

2150
01:48:43,80 --> 01:48:46,22
We don't do shit about it. We close it up, throw it back in the trunk,

2151
01:48:46,35 --> 01:48:48,93
everybody go home, have some pumpkin pie, warm apple cider.

2152
01:48:49,06 --> 01:48:50,81
I got a better idea.

2153
01:48:51,98 --> 01:48:55,32
Or would you rather me throw you and your brother in the fucking river?

2154
01:48:55,48 --> 01:48:58,49
Would you rather your house blows up next time?

2155
01:48:59,87 --> 01:49:02,00
嘿 你干什么?

2156
01:49:04,03 --> 01:49:05,26
Richie
-I loved that car. -I know.

2157
01:49:08,33 --> 01:49:11,37
What's he doing? Shakedown!

2158
01:49:13,32 --> 01:49:15,72
我听到的消息是科西嘉黑手党想杀Frank
Somebody's getting some money for the Benevolent Fund.

2159
01:49:14,38 --> 01:49:15,38
Look at that shit.

2160
01:49:16,05 --> 01:49:17,34
Sorry, Frank.

2161
01:49:17,76 --> 01:49:22,93
你知道法国贩毒网,Fernando Rey 他被Frank搞得没了生意
It's all right. Go and get in the car.

2162
01:49:22,97 --> 01:49:24,68
我在纽约就可以搞定他

2163
01:49:25,73 --> 01:49:29,86
只是不希望每次他开车路过 新泽西的时候有人向他开枪

2164
01:49:30,90 --> 01:49:33,69
Richie 我们应该开始合作

2165
01:49:35,23 --> 01:49:37,86
我们得联合各自的力量

2166
01:49:37,91 --> 01:49:39,30
下次也许他(Frank)就没这么走运了

2167
01:49:41,74 --> 01:49:43,71
我们得保证这个财源不死
All right, you call me back.

2168
01:49:46,87 --> 01:49:50,71
INS, IRS, FBI. I can't get a damn thing out of any of them.

2169
01:49:49,75 --> 01:49:50,71
你在这干嘛呢?
Because they all think you're on the take. And you think they are.

2170
01:49:56,76 --> 01:49:58,84
你们真的打算逮捕Frank Lucas?
You know, I don't think they want this to stop.

2171
01:49:59,88 --> 01:50:00,69
你怎么了?
I think it employs too many people.

2172
01:50:01,22 --> 01:50:02,72
怎么 你不知道?
Judges, lawyers, cops, politicians, prison guards, probation officers.

2173
01:50:02,76 --> 01:50:03,33
不知道

2174
01:50:03,97 --> 01:50:06,65
因为新泽西的人是疯子

2175
01:50:07,68 --> 01:50:09,90
知道我们这儿怎么做事的么? 警察 抓 坏人
They stop bringing dope into this country,

2176
01:50:09,73 --> 01:50:12,40
about 100,000 people are going to be out of a job.

2177
01:50:12,94 --> 01:50:15,32
下次你再来的时候 应该先给我打个电话

2178
01:50:15,74 --> 01:50:18,66
Spearman.

2179
01:50:17,86 --> 01:50:18,79
好确保安全
FBI. Here to see Detective Roberts.

2180
01:50:21,82 --> 01:50:24,70
你说过"我会和我的朋友谈 我能保证你没有"后顾之忧""

2181
01:50:24,74 --> 01:50:26,09
这话是你跟我说的 Dominic

2182
01:50:27,96 --> 01:50:30,79
"我能保证你没有"后顾之忧""!
So who took it out? Somebody I know? My wife?

2183
01:50:31,23 --> 01:50:32,76
我现在可不这么觉得!
Come on, if somebody's taking a contract out on my life, I'd like to know.

2184
01:50:35,39 --> 01:50:38,93
I can't say without compromising our source. You understand?

2185
01:50:38,20 --> 01:50:40,76
他们想杀我太太!
No. Not when it's my life, I don't understand.

2186
01:50:41,60 --> 01:50:44,77
-If you want we can assign someone to you. -FBI protection.

2187
01:50:44,97 --> 01:50:46,40
那些是什么人?
You know what? My life is dangerous enough as it is.

2188
01:50:48,33 --> 01:50:50,78
也许是你的人

2189
01:50:51,81 --> 01:50:52,94
- 我不知道 - 你不知道?
Well, we'll let you get back to your business.

2190
01:50:52,98 --> 01:50:53,94
不
Okay. Larry, Bob. Thanks for visiting The Garden State.

2191
01:50:53,98 --> 01:50:55,78
你不知道..

2192
01:50:56,82 --> 01:50:59,78
告诉你 也许我该放500把枪下去
Take care.

2193
01:50:58,16 --> 01:51:00,46
Hey, what do you know about Frank Lucas?

2194
01:50:59,82 --> 01:51:02,78
好让你明白明白我的意思
We know that you keep calling about him.

2195
01:51:02,99 --> 01:51:05,87
Frank,他也许是个吸毒的 或者是你的什么对头 或者是什么想出名的傻小子

2196
01:51:07,90 --> 01:51:12,75
某个你忘记收买的人 某个你得罪了却不知道到的人

2197
01:51:13,19 --> 01:51:15,75
也许是某个被你抢了生意的人
We believe that peace is at hand:

2198
01:51:15,79 --> 01:51:16,71
你现在多么风光 看看

2199
01:51:18,76 --> 01:51:21,93
成功 可是会招来很多敌人的

2200
01:51:20,27 --> 01:51:24,69
We believe that an agreement is within sight:

2201
01:51:22,97 --> 01:51:27,81
他们开枪射了你 你现在打算怎么办 打算杀谁?

2202
01:51:27,85 --> 01:51:33,81
还是打算就此罢手? Frank,你是想做一个成功的人但是有很多敌人...
As I said earlier:::

2203
01:51:34,69 --> 01:51:40,65
...还是想做一个失败者但有很多朋友? 这是我们自己要做出选择的
Yeah.

2204
01:51:37,37 --> 01:51:39,29
Hey, Joey. Hi.

2205
01:51:41,25 --> 01:51:44,09
All right. Yeah, tomorrow. Why?

2206
01:52:04,76 --> 01:52:05,93
- 接线员 - 你好
What the fuck is a microwave?

2207
01:52:05,97 --> 01:52:07,68
我想接一个国际长途
It's a scientific force, like atomic energy.

2208
01:52:08,72 --> 01:52:09,69
稍等
-Yeah? Yeah.

2209
01:52:10,33 --> 01:52:12,37
It rearranges the molecules.

2210
01:52:12,54 --> 01:52:14,58
Of what? Of what? Of popcorn.

2211
01:52:16,86 --> 01:52:18,90
- 喂? - 嘿
Of your head. Stick it in. Go on.

2212
01:52:18,94 --> 01:52:20,39
- 嘿 - 嘿 Frank 你好么?

2213
01:52:20,94 --> 01:52:21,86
那边怎么样?

2214
01:52:22,90 --> 01:52:24,70
- 结束了 - 是啊 我看了新闻
I can get you one of those.

2215
01:52:24,74 --> 01:52:25,64
到底怎么回事?
Brand new, just like this. I'll have it delivered.

2216
01:52:26,28 --> 01:52:27,74
游戏结束了 Frank

2217
01:52:28,18 --> 01:52:30,99
结束了 大家都回家了 给和平一个机会

2218
01:52:29,76 --> 01:52:31,31
No, thank you.

2219
01:52:31,82 --> 01:52:34,76
听着 听我说... 我要两千公斤

2220
01:52:35,19 --> 01:52:39,67
- 两千公斤 空运过来 - 不可能的 Frank

2221
01:52:39,71 --> 01:52:43,80
- 我们的人都在撤退了 - 我现在就到你那里去
Hey. Where is that?

2222
01:52:43,84 --> 01:52:45,21
- 现在? - 没错
Aspen. We just got back. Had a great time. You know who we met?

2223
01:52:47,62 --> 01:52:49,29
Who?

2224
01:52:49,45 --> 01:52:51,16
Burt Reynolds.

2225
01:52:51,33 --> 01:52:55,00
-Yeah? Yeah? -Yeah. I'm not kidding.

2226
01:52:54,69 --> 01:52:55,73
Spearman,快她妈醒醒
A lot people from Hollywood go up there now. They're buying up everything.

2227
01:52:56,77 --> 01:52:57,69
怎么了?

2228
01:52:59,73 --> 01:53:02,82
- 你个臭婊子 - 别伤害我 Jimmy!
-This is your place? -Mmm.

2229
01:53:00,97 --> 01:53:04,76
You know what that's worth? Ski in, ski out. Five bedrooms.

2230
01:53:04,86 --> 01:53:06,75
- 上帝啊 警察! - 警察!
Sauna. Everything. We were guests.

2231
01:53:06,78 --> 01:53:08,87
- 放下武器 Jimmy! - 放下武器!

2232
01:53:08,91 --> 01:53:10,91
- 手放到我们能看到的地方! - Jimmy把枪放下!

2233
01:53:10,95 --> 01:53:12,79
- 不是在开玩笑 - 把枪放下

2234
01:53:13,82 --> 01:53:14,79
别开枪! 别开枪!
It's your place.

2235
01:53:16,83 --> 01:53:19,71
我现在有你的枪 还有你的指纹

2236
01:53:21,25 --> 01:53:23,80
知道你有什么么?

2237
01:53:23,84 --> 01:53:24,88
谋杀未遂

2238
01:53:25,92 --> 01:53:27,93
能判18年呢

2239
01:53:27,97 --> 01:53:30,27
谋杀未遂和谋杀一样 是要面对大陪审团的

2240
01:53:29,54 --> 01:53:32,00
Isn't there something we can do,

2241
01:53:31,81 --> 01:53:35,89
大陪审团可能做出各种裁决 可以判你罪名成立

2242
01:53:33,92 --> 01:53:36,76
about leaving the big guy alone?

2243
01:53:35,93 --> 01:53:39,78
也可以认定你是自卫
You know who I mean.

2244
01:53:39,81 --> 01:53:43,78
- 都取决于我们怎么处理 - 你明白了么 Jimmy?
I don't report what you just said, I can get in a lot of trouble.

2245
01:53:43,82 --> 01:53:46,70
我们来看看 你觉得你表哥Frank会怎么想?
I do report it, then the trouble is yours.

2246
01:53:47,73 --> 01:53:50,78
他会知道我们在某时某地曾和你这样交谈过
I'm hoping you won't do that.

2247
01:53:51,83 --> 01:53:53,91
然后你会上庭 被指控谋杀未遂
Richie, come on. I'm not taping it.

2248
01:53:53,36 --> 01:53:56,44
How do you know? Because we're friends.

2249
01:53:54,95 --> 01:53:56,87
他会怎么想? 他傻么?

2250
01:53:56,91 --> 01:53:57,83
你表哥Frank是傻瓜么?
And I'm telling you, this is a real offer.

2251
01:53:58,87 --> 01:53:59,63
回答他的问题!
From who? Your uncle?

2252
01:54:00,17 --> 01:54:02,96
不 他会认为你跟我们说了

2253
01:54:06,01 --> 01:54:07,89
但现在Frank还不知道
Why would you do this? Why would you risk our friendship?

2254
01:54:07,29 --> 01:54:08,58
Because

2255
01:54:08,93 --> 01:54:10,77
你觉得Frank会想从报纸上知道这个消息么?

2256
01:54:11,80 --> 01:54:16,77
或许你可以就这样出去 不用保释 不用受审 不用坐牢 就这样出去
I care what happens to you.

2257
01:54:15,30 --> 01:54:17,09
You shouldn't have done this.

2258
01:54:18,73 --> 01:54:19,69
你的决定
I had to, I had no choice. Neither do you. Richie!

2259
01:54:21,18 --> 01:54:24,94
You don't have a choice. Just leave Frank Lucas alone.

2260
01:54:26,69 --> 01:54:28,15
Frank Lucas?

2261
01:54:29,74 --> 01:54:35,70
罂粟花比任何战争都要长寿
Yeah.

2262
01:54:33,20 --> 01:54:36,03
You tell Marie I had to leave. I'm sorry.

2263
01:54:35,74 --> 01:54:38,83
军队撤退时他们还会留在这里
Tell her why.

2264
01:54:40,87 --> 01:54:43,88
最后一架美国飞机离开之后 你要拿什么东西来运呢?

2265
01:54:45,91 --> 01:54:47,08
我会想出办法的

2266
01:54:49,72 --> 01:54:51,81
你还会再见到我的 这点是肯定的

2267
01:54:53,85 --> 01:54:58,81
Frank,这话我本不该说

2268
01:55:00,85 --> 01:55:01,82
但是急流勇退是明智的

2269
01:55:21,25 --> 01:55:22,71
-Talk! Talk! -Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

2270
01:55:22,83 --> 01:55:25,09
-Are you Richie Roberts? -Yes, so what?

2271
01:55:25,92 --> 01:55:28,05
You've been served. I'm sorry.

2272
01:55:42,44 --> 01:55:43,40
All right.

2273
01:55:44,16 --> 01:55:44,90
喂

2274
01:55:45,94 --> 01:55:46,70
去叫他

2275
01:55:47,61 --> 01:55:48,70
Laurie.

2276
01:55:50,74 --> 01:55:52,86
- 怎么了? - 没事
Look, I'm sorry I never gave you the kind of life you wanted, all right.

2277
01:55:52,91 --> 01:55:53,95
是Frank

2278
01:55:55,98 --> 01:55:56,92
喂?
I'm sorry it was never enough.

2279
01:55:57,95 --> 01:55:59,91
Newark

2280
01:55:59,95 --> 01:56:01,15
临时停车场
Don't punish me for being honest.

2281
01:56:01,79 --> 01:56:03,79
3号
Don't take my boy away.

2282
01:56:05,83 --> 01:56:07,80
我们说的是那辆野马车 对吧?
What are you saying? That because you were honest

2283
01:56:07,84 --> 01:56:09,71
好 车牌号是多少?

2284
01:56:10,75 --> 01:56:15,19
KA760
and you didn't take money like every other cop, I left you?

2285
01:56:15,33 --> 01:56:17,81
好的
No, you don't take money for one reason.

2286
01:56:17,85 --> 01:56:21,85
Newark没有临时停车场
To buy being dishonest about everything else.

2287
01:56:19,86 --> 01:56:21,77
And that's worse than taking money nobody gives a shit about.

2288
01:56:21,89 --> 01:56:23,81
- 我知道 - 也许他们说的是时间
Drug money, gambling money nobody's gonna miss.

2289
01:56:23,85 --> 01:56:24,85
三点钟?

2290
01:56:24,90 --> 01:56:26,86
这不是新泽西的车牌
You know, I'd rather you took it and been honest with me.

2291
01:56:26,89 --> 01:56:27,82
也不是纽约的

2292
01:56:29,85 --> 01:56:32,78
KA760
Or don't take it. I don't care. But then don't go cheat on me.

2293
01:56:31,75 --> 01:56:33,58
Don't cheat on your kid by never being around.

2294
01:56:33,82 --> 01:56:34,82
Kilo Alpha?
Don't go out and get laid by your snitches and your secretaries and strippers!

2295
01:56:35,86 --> 01:56:36,82
那架飞机?

2296
01:56:37,87 --> 01:56:40,88
Kilo Alpha 760
I can tell by just looking, she's one of them.

2297
01:56:40,91 --> 01:56:43,83
你去查民航飞机 你去查私人飞机
You...

2298
01:56:42,17 --> 01:56:46,72
You think you're going to heaven because you're honest, but you're not.

2299
01:56:43,87 --> 01:56:47,83
所有型号都不能放过 明白?

2300
01:56:47,88 --> 01:56:48,84
- 军用飞机也要查 - 你要去哪里?
You're going to the same hell as the crooked cops you can't stand.

2301
01:56:49,87 --> 01:56:50,90
哪儿也不许去 坐下
All rise.

2302
01:56:56,69 --> 01:56:58,86
Please be seated.

2303
01:56:59,86 --> 01:57:04,16
Miss Dickerson, before the court renders its opinion,

2304
01:57:04,37 --> 01:57:06,95
is there anything else you'd like to be heard on?

2305
01:57:07,12 --> 01:57:08,83
Yes, Your Honour.

2306
01:57:08,95 --> 01:57:12,04
Your Honour, a lot has been said here today about how unsavoury

2307
01:57:12,21 --> 01:57:16,13
Mr Roberts' environment is for a child. How dangerous it is.

2308
01:57:14,86 --> 01:57:16,75
队长. - 是?
We tell him to protect us. We give him that responsibility,

2309
01:57:16,78 --> 01:57:18,82
我是Richie Roberts, Essex县警局

2310
01:57:18,87 --> 01:57:23,87
我知道你在等我们,这是我们的搜查令 我们要搜查这架飞机
but then say, "Oh, we don't trust you to raise a child.

2311
01:57:23,91 --> 01:57:26,87
- 等等 - 你们要截住所有的士兵并检查他们的行李
"We don't think you're fit for that."

2312
01:57:24,51 --> 01:57:26,06
I'm not.

2313
01:57:26,91 --> 01:57:32,84
每一个都要查.
You're right.

2314
01:57:29,56 --> 01:57:31,98
Being around me is no place for a kid.

2315
01:57:32,15 --> 01:57:35,32
You take him to Vegas. I'll come see him when I can.

2316
01:57:37,97 --> 01:57:40,89
破门许可搜查令
Your Honour, I want to apologise for wasting the court's time.

2317
01:57:40,92 --> 01:57:42,76
从楼上开始查

2318
01:57:42,81 --> 01:57:43,85
他们要去那儿?

2319
01:57:43,89 --> 01:57:45,81
这与你无关

2320
01:57:45,85 --> 01:57:49,81
- 夫人,请您坐下 - 这是怎么回事

2321
01:57:49,86 --> 01:57:52,86
停下停下

2322
01:57:52,90 --> 01:57:54,86
任何事物不得离开该区域,明白么?
Doc.

2323
01:57:54,90 --> 01:57:56,70
调头! - 截停这些卡车
I see them.

2324
01:57:56,74 --> 01:57:58,78
- 停一下停一下 - 放倒所有墙上的东西
There he is.

2325
01:57:58,82 --> 01:58:00,74
这飞机太大了,Richie

2326
01:58:00,78 --> 01:58:03,91
- 这到底是怎么回事 - 任何人未经我们搜查不得离开这一区域

2327
01:58:03,95 --> 01:58:05,79
好么,队长,任何人

2328
01:58:05,83 --> 01:58:08,83
我们要搜查飞机,卡车以及这里所有的人

2329
01:58:08,87 --> 01:58:11,79
请阅读搜查令

2330
01:58:11,83 --> 01:58:13,93
你丈夫奢华的生活到此结束

2331
01:58:13,96 --> 01:58:18,72
联邦会把这里所有的东西都没收,全部

2332
01:58:17,11 --> 01:58:18,74
The fuck is this guy doing?

2333
01:58:18,76 --> 01:58:23,81
但在那之前我要先找到我要的
Hey! -Champagne.

2334
01:58:20,99 --> 01:58:23,12
Merry Christmas, Detectives. -For us?

2335
01:58:23,84 --> 01:58:24,86
钱在哪儿?
Yeah. Enjoy that.

2336
01:58:24,89 --> 01:58:26,73
你在说什么,什么钱
-You fellas have a good time. -Mmm-hmm.

2337
01:58:26,77 --> 01:58:28,65
我在说什么?什么钱?

2338
01:58:28,69 --> 01:58:32,73
逃命钱,Frank和他所有的党羽放在这座房子里的逃命钱
It's Cristal.

2339
01:58:32,77 --> 01:58:36,90
你要是现在离开的话也许Frank还不会要你的命

2340
01:58:34,63 --> 01:58:36,89
South Vietnamese troops called in air strikes

2341
01:58:36,94 --> 01:58:38,95
闭嘴,坐下
on Communist positions inside the city:

2342
01:58:38,98 --> 01:58:44,91
坐下!

2343
01:58:41,47 --> 01:58:44,14
Paying off Johnny Law, that's one thing.

2344
01:58:44,27 --> 01:58:45,23
There ain't no problem with that.

2345
01:58:45,39 --> 01:58:48,40
I've been paying off the police since I was 10 years old.

2346
01:58:48,57 --> 01:58:51,32
Put more of their kids through college than the National Merit Award.

2347
01:58:51,49 --> 01:58:53,20
Give me one of them round one... Yeah.

2348
01:58:53,32 --> 01:58:55,20
This is different, though. These...

2349
01:58:55,36 --> 01:58:59,20
Special Investigative Unit. That's their problem. They think they're special.

2350
01:58:59,41 --> 01:59:01,96
Fucking crooks. No code of ethics.

2351
01:59:02,12 --> 01:59:03,08
What do you think?

2352
01:59:03,25 --> 01:59:05,67
Looks great. It's beautiful.

2353
01:59:05,83 --> 01:59:06,92
Good.

2354
01:59:07,55 --> 01:59:09,55
The police, that ain't the only somebody I'm worried about.

2355
01:59:09,71 --> 01:59:12,63
I seeing cars where I ain't never seen them before, people I don't know.

2356
01:59:12,80 --> 01:59:14,05
Yeah, me, too.

2357
01:59:14,22 --> 01:59:15,68
Ho, ho, ho.

2358
01:59:15,85 --> 01:59:16,93
-Merry Christmas, Charlie. -Thank you.

2359
01:59:19,89 --> 01:59:22,27
-Merry Christmas, Charlie. -Thank you.

2360
01:59:22,40 --> 01:59:24,06
-I love you. -I love you, too.

2361
01:59:24,70 --> 01:59:27,74
从越南返回的这架C130上载有令人悲伤的货物
Here, take this.

2362
01:59:27,78 --> 01:59:33,71
英勇的美军官兵的灵柩
A quick toast, and then I'll be off.

2363
01:59:28,94 --> 01:59:33,16
What happened here was an accident of war: Somebody made a mistake:

2364
01:59:34,16 --> 01:59:38,79
Bumpy ain't hardly ever go out no more. After a certain point he stayed in the house.

2365
01:59:41,54 --> 01:59:43,75
Watch TV.

2366
01:59:45,00 --> 01:59:47,01
Play chess. Read the newspaper.

2367
01:59:48,67 --> 01:59:52,93
I thought he was just trying to lead the quiet life, but no, he couldn't go nowhere.

2368
01:59:53,05 --> 01:59:56,18
-Not without something happening. -Frankie...

2369
01:59:56,86 --> 02:00:02,82
伙计们,把这些棺材抬下去
-We can still go out. -With who? Where?

2370
01:59:59,85 --> 02:00:03,27
-Well, with... -But I know he's under surveillance.

2371
02:00:04,40 --> 02:00:07,99
Ain't gonna be no Christmas time with my family being here no more.

2372
02:00:06,74 --> 02:00:12,71
- 打开 - 我不干
Why don't you just pay who you have to pay?

2373
02:00:11,37 --> 02:00:15,70
I do pay them. I pay thousands and millions to dope dealers, crooks, cops.

2374
02:00:15,75 --> 02:00:21,72
这狗叫得可真凶啊
I pay everybody. I pay more than they should get.

2375
02:00:18,63 --> 02:00:20,75
I can't satisfy nobody!

2376
02:00:20,88 --> 02:00:25,05
It's like dope! Everybody's strung out! The more you give 'em, the more they want.

2377
02:00:24,97 --> 02:00:27,69
你必须立即停止
They expect more.

2378
02:00:27,72 --> 02:00:30,93
我的搜查令允许我搜查这架飞机
Give more and they want more.

2379
02:00:30,97 --> 02:00:33,69
以及机上的货物

2380
02:00:33,73 --> 02:00:36,79
但是你没有我的许可

2381
02:00:36,83 --> 02:00:39,86
我不需要你的许可,队长
Do you want to go out?

2382
02:00:39,90 --> 02:00:41,82
别紧张
All right, baby. Put something of what you got.

2383
02:00:41,86 --> 02:00:43,86
来吧,别叫
-Should I? -Yeah.

2384
02:00:41,86 --> 02:00:43,03
That's Christmas spirit.

2385
02:00:43,90 --> 02:00:49,87
Frank,让开
That's what I'm talking about. Feliz Navidad:

2386
02:00:45,53 --> 02:00:46,99
-Something nice? -Mmm-hmm.

2387
02:00:52,75 --> 02:00:58,71
我考

2388
02:00:54,75 --> 02:00:56,29
We're going to have a great time.

2389
02:00:56,42 --> 02:00:57,46
That's right, chica:

2390
02:00:58,79 --> 02:01:04,76
够了!
Mr Lucas. Enjoy your evening.

2391
02:01:00,21 --> 02:01:01,30
It's all clear.

2392
02:01:07,76 --> 02:01:09,85
盯紧这些棺材,千万盯住
Nicky!

2393
02:01:07,97 --> 02:01:09,68
Who is that? There's your boy, Nicky. See him?

2394
02:01:09,88 --> 02:01:12,85
明白了,放心
Know what I'm saying?

2395
02:01:10,98 --> 02:01:13,52
Yeah, I see him. Let's keep going.

2396
02:01:12,89 --> 02:01:18,86
过来帮帮我
Around back?

2397
02:01:15,48 --> 02:01:18,48
Hell, no. I ain't sneaking into my own club.

2398
02:01:18,94 --> 02:01:20,82
-Incredible. -Huh?

2399
02:01:39,67 --> 02:01:41,80
那是一家军用运输机

2400
02:01:41,84 --> 02:01:44,92
如果上面有海洛因的话说明军方有人参与贩毒
Come on.

2401
02:01:44,96 --> 02:01:49,73
意味着即便打了一场牺牲了5万美国人生命的战争的同时...

2402
02:01:47,43 --> 02:01:48,43
Hold on. Hold on.

2403
02:01:49,76 --> 02:01:54,77
...军方在走私毒品.这是对今天事件能够做出的解释

2404
02:01:54,81 --> 02:02:00,73
某些人相信美国军队参与了毒品运输交易...

2405
02:01:56,90 --> 02:01:57,90
What?

2406
02:01:58,07 --> 02:01:59,86
I want to wait in the car.

2407
02:02:00,77 --> 02:02:03,73
...并试图亵渎那些为自由民主而献出宝贵生命的...
Frank, I got it. I got it. I'll wait for it. I got it.

2408
02:02:03,77 --> 02:02:06,70
...的年轻人的遗体来证明这一点
-Get that yellow sauce. -Yellow sauce.

2409
02:02:06,82 --> 02:02:10,74
- 那架飞机上有毒品 - 你他妈闭嘴吧!
And the chicken. The Kung Pao chicken.

2410
02:02:10,78 --> 02:02:13,79
在你这次行动后,毫无疑问地

2411
02:02:13,83 --> 02:02:18,71
整个联邦反毒计划会遭遇危机,会被毫不留情而彻底地...
Can you turn the heater on?

2412
02:02:18,75 --> 02:02:23,92
...像那架运输机一样被拆得支离破碎. 这就是你的杰作,Roberts先生

2413
02:02:21,97 --> 02:02:24,27
Shit. I'm gonna go get the keys.

2414
02:02:23,96 --> 02:02:25,84
我有可靠的情报

2415
02:02:25,88 --> 02:02:27,81
我所调查的目标在用那架飞机运进毒品

2416
02:02:27,84 --> 02:02:30,80
- 那个目标是谁?

2417
02:02:30,84 --> 02:02:31,97
- Frank Lucas. - 谁?

2418
02:02:32,01 --> 02:02:33,90
他叫Frank Lucas

2419
02:02:33,93 --> 02:02:36,81
谁是Frank Lucas? 他的老大是谁? 是哪个家族的?

2420
02:02:36,84 --> 02:02:41,81
他不是意大利人,是黑人
-Doc, give me the keys. Here you go.

2421
02:02:41,86 --> 02:02:44,82
你是不是在讲笑话?

2422
02:02:44,86 --> 02:02:49,82
你在执法部门的前途还差这么一点儿就到头儿了 你他妈还有心思开玩笑?

2423
02:02:46,37 --> 02:02:47,63
Doc!

2424
02:02:49,86 --> 02:02:52,70
我的调查表明

2425
02:02:52,74 --> 02:02:54,79
Frank Lucas在毒品交易市场里的地位...
Get out of the car.

2426
02:02:54,82 --> 02:02:55,95
...凌驾于黑手党之上

2427
02:02:55,99 --> 02:02:58,84
调查同样表明Frank Lucas

2428
02:02:58,87 --> 02:03:01,83
直接从东南亚购入毒品
You okay? -Yeah.

2429
02:03:01,88 --> 02:03:04,86
他跳过中间商并借助在美军中的内线
Shit.

2430
02:03:03,27 --> 02:03:04,27
Come on.

2431
02:03:04,89 --> 02:03:07,84
来使用军机将高纯度4号海洛因运入美国
Come on, baby. You all right?

2432
02:03:07,48 --> 02:03:08,73
Let's go.

2433
02:03:09,80 --> 02:03:13,69
而且他自从1969年就已经开始这么做了

2434
02:03:13,72 --> 02:03:16,68
我有Frank团伙中每个成员的案例

2435
02:03:16,72 --> 02:03:20,73
Frank团伙?近百年来没有任何黑鬼 在美国成立过任何组织

2436
02:03:20,76 --> 02:03:24,73
你知道为什么吗?因为你是头蠢猪

2437
02:03:24,77 --> 02:03:29,70
- Lou,能帮我个忙么,让这个犹太杂种滚蛋 - 你说我是犹太杂种?

2438
02:03:29,34 --> 02:03:31,05
Was it Nicky?

2439
02:03:32,78 --> 02:03:34,87
嗨Richie
We'll go right now and fucking kill him whether it was him or not,

2440
02:03:34,91 --> 02:03:37,79
你的结论是错的
you say the word, Frankie.

2441
02:03:37,83 --> 02:03:43,79
Spearman正在跟踪那些棺材
We got to do something, Frank.

2442
02:03:41,23 --> 02:03:42,23
We can't just sit here.

2443
02:03:42,40 --> 02:03:43,86
We're leaving.

2444
02:03:46,94 --> 02:03:48,57
-All right, everybody get out. You all right, man?

2445
02:03:48,74 --> 02:03:50,95
Go on home. It's Christmas time. Go and be with your families.

2446
02:03:51,07 --> 02:03:52,32
I'm all right.

2447
02:03:52,53 --> 02:03:55,62
Go on. Go ahead. Be with your kids.

2448
02:03:55,79 --> 02:03:57,04
Go ahead.

2449
02:04:09,05 --> 02:04:10,05
Where are we gonna go, huh?

2450
02:04:10,26 --> 02:04:11,80
We're gonna go to Spain, somewhere? China?

2451
02:04:11,97 --> 02:04:15,39
Huh? Come on, sit down. Tell me where you want to go.

2452
02:04:14,82 --> 02:04:16,71
怎么了
Frank, we can go anywhere we want.

2453
02:04:16,74 --> 02:04:22,71
警察去家里搜查了,很糟糕

2454
02:04:19,19 --> 02:04:20,73
-No, we can't. -We can live anywhere, Frank.

2455
02:04:20,86 --> 02:04:22,82
Where? And do what? Run? Hide?

2456
02:04:22,98 --> 02:04:25,90
Frank Lucas don't run from nobody, baby.

2457
02:04:26,03 --> 02:04:27,74
We ain't going nowhere. We're gonna stay right here.

2458
02:04:27,95 --> 02:04:30,16
We're gonna stay right here. This is my home.

2459
02:04:30,32 --> 02:04:33,58
This is where my business is, my wife, my mother, my family.

2460
02:04:33,74 --> 02:04:36,21
My country. I ain't going nowhere.

2461
02:04:35,72 --> 02:04:38,76
- Frankie,我需要和你说几句话,很快就好
I ain't running from nobody!

2462
02:04:38,80 --> 02:04:40,77
- 就一分钟,坐下 - 妈妈,我得走了
This is America.

2463
02:04:40,81 --> 02:04:44,77
- 你能不能过会儿再回来? 谢谢 -妈妈我真的该走了

2464
02:04:44,81 --> 02:04:47,77
- 只是几句话而已 -我要走了

2465
02:04:47,81 --> 02:04:48,86
求求你,就几句话,来坐下
And you ain't going nowhere, either!

2466
02:04:48,90 --> 02:04:51,78
我一直在想些事情

2467
02:04:51,82 --> 02:04:56,70
如果你是一名传教士,那你的兄弟也会成为传教士

2468
02:04:53,60 --> 02:04:54,69
Huh?

2469
02:04:56,74 --> 02:05:00,79
如果你是一名士兵,那他们也会去当士兵
A ceasefire, internationally supervised,

2470
02:04:59,23 --> 02:05:01,65
will begin at 7:00 p: M: This Saturday, January 27th, Washington time:

2471
02:05:00,82 --> 02:05:02,79
他们都是因为你来这里的
Will begin at 7:00 p: M: This Saturday, January 27th, Washington time:

2472
02:05:02,83 --> 02:05:05,71
- 是你打电话叫他们来的,对么 - 对
I'll call you back.

2473
02:05:05,74 --> 02:05:09,80
那是因为他们都很崇拜你
Hey! What are you doing?

2474
02:05:09,84 --> 02:05:13,76
他们一直认为你知道什么是最该做的
Richie.

2475
02:05:13,80 --> 02:05:19,68
但是就算是他们也知道,你不会杀警察

2476
02:05:15,96 --> 02:05:17,04
Wow.

2477
02:05:19,72 --> 02:05:22,77
就连我也知道
So, what I hear it was the Corsican mob took a shot at Frank.

2478
02:05:22,81 --> 02:05:24,69
- 她也知道 -好的.
You know, French Connection, Fernando Rey,

2479
02:05:24,73 --> 02:05:26,90
而看起来唯一不清楚这一点的人是你
the exporters that Frank has put out of business.

2480
02:05:26,94 --> 02:05:31,32
好了妈妈,我保证,我不会杀任何人 -你坐下

2481
02:05:31,35 --> 02:05:35,70
- 我从来都没问过你这一切都是怎么来的 因为我不想听你对我说谎 -因为我不想让你为这些操心
Look, I can take care of him in New York.

2482
02:05:32,23 --> 02:05:33,60
I just don't want to have to worry that every time

2483
02:05:33,77 --> 02:05:35,23
he drives across the bridge to Jersey,

2484
02:05:35,73 --> 02:05:41,66
- 我该走了 - 别对我说谎!!!!
someone's gonna take another shot at him.

2485
02:05:38,28 --> 02:05:41,86
Richie, you and I gotta start working together.

2486
02:05:42,03 --> 02:05:44,66
We need to step up our efforts.

2487
02:05:44,87 --> 02:05:50,79
你难道想把事情变得不可挽救 让家人离你而去么?
Next time, their aim could be better.

2488
02:05:48,04 --> 02:05:50,66
We need to keep this cash cow alive.

2489
02:05:50,84 --> 02:05:52,84
- 他们会的 - 我明白

2490
02:05:52,88 --> 02:05:58,84
她会离开你

2491
02:05:56,42 --> 02:05:58,63
What the fuck are you doing here?

2492
02:05:58,88 --> 02:06:04,81
我也会离开你!
Whoa!

2493
02:06:03,72 --> 02:06:06,18
Were you actually gonna arrest Frank Lucas?

2494
02:06:06,35 --> 02:06:07,73
What's the matter with you?

2495
02:06:08,06 --> 02:06:10,27
-What, you don't know? -No.

2496
02:06:10,94 --> 02:06:13,94
Everybody in New Jersey's crazy.

2497
02:06:14,07 --> 02:06:17,40
You know what we do here? Cops arrest bad guys.

2498
02:06:19,74 --> 02:06:21,70
Before you get on that bridge again,

2499
02:06:21,87 --> 02:06:25,20
you should call me first, just make sure it's safe.

2500
02:06:27,92 --> 02:06:33,88
- Richie,有些棺材要被运走了 - 我们要盯那些普通棺材,不是那些为仪式准备的
"I'm more enlightened than some of my friends.

2501
02:06:30,04 --> 02:06:32,00
"I can guarantee you peace of mind."

2502
02:06:32,17 --> 02:06:34,38
That's what you told me, Dominic.

2503
02:06:34,80 --> 02:06:37,80
这些人是谁?
"I can guarantee you peace of mind!"

2504
02:06:37,84 --> 02:06:42,85
车上写什么?
I don't feel so peaceful!

2505
02:06:42,89 --> 02:06:48,85
Bayonne,Bayonne,那他妈什么玩艺儿
Huh?

2506
02:06:45,39 --> 02:06:47,52
They tried to kill my wife!

2507
02:06:52,11 --> 02:06:53,90
Who was that? Huh?

2508
02:06:54,90 --> 02:06:56,94
我考,那不是打棒球的小子么
Maybe it was one of your peoples.

2509
02:06:56,99 --> 02:07:01,91
- 对,那是Stevie Lucas - 你想怎么办,跟着卡车?
-I don't know yet. No. -You don't know?

2510
02:07:01,94 --> 02:07:04,95
不,我要呆在这儿订着Lucas这小子
You don't know.

2511
02:07:04,99 --> 02:07:06,87
我们跟踪他的车
I'll tell you what I know. Maybe I should just put 500 guns

2512
02:07:06,91 --> 02:07:12,88
嗨,你们最好都吃了,这会是个漫长的夜晚
out there on the street and just start shooting up some people,

2513
02:07:08,88 --> 02:07:09,88
just to make a point.

2514
02:07:10,00 --> 02:07:13,26
Frank, it was a junkie. It was a rival. Some dumb-ass kid

2515
02:07:13,42 --> 02:07:17,10
trying to make a name for himself. Somebody you forgot to pay off.

2516
02:07:17,26 --> 02:07:20,18
Someone you slighted without even realising it.

2517
02:07:21,80 --> 02:07:25,72
这可比金子还要贵重,比黄金还要贵重
Could be someone you put out of business from being so successful. Look at you.

2518
02:07:25,76 --> 02:07:28,77
还有两包,抓紧干
Success, it's got enemies, Frank. Lots of enemies.

2519
02:07:28,81 --> 02:07:29,94
接着

2520
02:07:29,98 --> 02:07:34,69
- 接着 - 马上就好
So your success took a shot at you. What are you gonna do now?

2521
02:07:34,73 --> 02:07:40,70
伙计们还有四厢,让我们挣大钱把
How you gonna kill it? You're gonna become unsuccessful?

2522
02:07:37,91 --> 02:07:41,00
Frank, we can be successful and have enemies, right?

2523
02:07:40,86 --> 02:07:43,70
- 他们在装什么呢? - 那就是毒品
Or we can be unsuccessful, too, you know, we can have friends.

2524
02:07:43,73 --> 02:07:45,91
一定是毒品
That's the choice we make.

2525
02:07:45,95 --> 02:07:47,87
一定是

2526
02:07:47,90 --> 02:07:49,83
我们走
The final evacuation of military and diplomatic personnel

2527
02:07:49,87 --> 02:07:55,84
出发

2528
02:07:52,59 --> 02:07:53,97
continued throughout the night,

2529
02:07:54,14 --> 02:07:57,14
as North Vietnamese troops marched on Saigon:

2530
02:07:57,31 --> 02:08:02,44
The imminent fall of the city has brought chaos and a growing sense of desperation:

2531
02:08:11,45 --> 02:08:14,87
-Operator: -Yeah, Bangkok, 367, international.

2532
02:08:14,99 --> 02:08:16,37
One moment, please:

2533
02:08:24,92 --> 02:08:26,26
Yeah, Nate:

2534
02:08:26,38 --> 02:08:28,01
Hey, Frank. What's up, baby?

2535
02:08:28,17 --> 02:08:29,55
What's going on over there?

2536
02:08:29,68 --> 02:08:30,84
It's all over:

2537
02:08:30,97 --> 02:08:32,76
Yeah, I'm watching the news. What the hell's going on?

2538
02:08:32,93 --> 02:08:34,56
The game's over, Frank:

2539
02:08:34,72 --> 02:08:36,02
-Huh? -It's done.

2540
02:08:36,18 --> 02:08:38,14
Everybody going home, baby. Give peace a chance.

2541
02:08:38,27 --> 02:08:39,60
Well, look, I'm not::: Listen to me:

2542
02:08:39,73 --> 02:08:41,27
I want two...

2543
02:08:43,88 --> 02:08:46,89
Lou,我是Richie,所有人都已就位
I want 2,000 keys in the air.

2544
02:08:45,19 --> 02:08:48,45
It's impossible, Frank: All our resources are going home: It's over:

2545
02:08:46,93 --> 02:08:49,77
- 所有人 - 你确定?

2546
02:08:49,80 --> 02:08:51,69
决对肯定
I'll tell you what. I'm on my way over there.

2547
02:08:51,73 --> 02:08:55,94
他们在Steven Crane区南塔楼
-Right now? Oh, come::: -Yeah.

2548
02:08:55,97 --> 02:08:58,86
你确定那就是目标,绝对肯定？

2549
02:08:58,90 --> 02:09:01,66
绝对肯定,Lou,决对肯定
You stole my shit?

2550
02:09:01,69 --> 02:09:03,86
一切就绪,所有的人都准备好了
-Spearman, wake the fuck up, man. -What?

2551
02:09:03,90 --> 02:09:06,74
你就下命令并打电话要许可证把,好么

2552
02:09:06,78 --> 02:09:12,70
好,我同意
Where's my shit, Darlynn?

2553
02:09:07,76 --> 02:09:09,72
Don't hurt me, Jimmy!

2554
02:09:11,35 --> 02:09:13,14
Jesus! What the... Police! Police!

2555
02:09:13,31 --> 02:09:15,19
Drop the gun, Jimmy! Drop the gun!

2556
02:09:15,35 --> 02:09:17,40
Let me see your hands! Jimmy, drop the fucking gun!

2557
02:09:17,56 --> 02:09:20,32
I'm not playing with you, Jimmy! I'll blast your fucking head off!

2558
02:09:20,44 --> 02:09:22,40
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

2559
02:09:23,99 --> 02:09:27,07
I got your gun and I got your prints.

2560
02:09:28,33 --> 02:09:32,54
You know what you got? You got attempted murder.

2561
02:09:32,79 --> 02:09:34,92
Fifteen fucking years!

2562
02:09:35,08 --> 02:09:38,42
Attempted murder is the same as Murder One, that's a grand jury.

2563
02:09:38,55 --> 02:09:40,76
Now, a grand jury could come back favourably.

2564
02:09:40,92 --> 02:09:44,01
It could be reduced to manslaughter.

2565
02:09:44,14 --> 02:09:46,26
All right? Maybe even self-defence.

2566
02:09:46,43 --> 02:09:48,31
It all just depends on how we wanna deal with you.

2567
02:09:48,43 --> 02:09:50,31
See where this is fucking going, Jimmy?

2568
02:09:50,52 --> 02:09:51,60
Let's say you beat it.

2569
02:09:51,73 --> 02:09:53,94
What you think your cousin Frank is gonna think?

2570
02:09:54,06 --> 02:09:56,36
Right, he is gonna know, at some point in time,

2571
02:09:56,52 --> 02:09:58,99
we sat you down, and we talked to you like this.

2572
02:09:59,11 --> 02:10:01,78
And then you go to court and you beat attempted murder?

2573
02:10:01,91 --> 02:10:05,33
What's he gonna think? Is he stupid? Is your cousin Frank stupid?

2574
02:10:05,49 --> 02:10:07,37
Answer him!

2575
02:10:07,50 --> 02:10:10,25
No. He's going to assume that you talked.

2576
02:10:09,72 --> 02:10:14,93
- 这是搜查许可证 - 好

2577
02:10:13,38 --> 02:10:15,75
But right now, Frank doesn't know.

2578
02:10:14,98 --> 02:10:20,94
我们走
You want Frank to read about this in the papers?

2579
02:10:18,38 --> 02:10:20,34
Or do you just want to walk out of here?

2580
02:10:20,47 --> 02:10:24,06
No bail, no trial, no jail, just walk out of here today:

2581
02:10:25,22 --> 02:10:26,68
Your choice:

2582
02:10:33,79 --> 02:10:37,87
快点

2583
02:10:37,92 --> 02:10:41,71
- 你好女士 - 你是谁?
Opium plants are hard enough to outlive any war.

2584
02:10:41,75 --> 02:10:45,71
趴下,趴下
They'll still be here long after the troops have gone.

2585
02:10:45,76 --> 02:10:48,24
我们走

2586
02:10:48,27 --> 02:10:50,72
这边,跟上
What are you going to do for transportation when the last US plane goes home?

2587
02:10:52,92 --> 02:10:54,88
I'll figure something out.

2588
02:10:56,47 --> 02:10:59,18
You will see me again, that's for sure.

2589
02:11:00,51 --> 02:11:03,60
It is not in my best interest to say this, Frank,

2590
02:11:04,02 --> 02:11:06,94
but quitting while you're ahead

2591
02:11:07,65 --> 02:11:09,77
is not the same as quitting.

2592
02:11:33,85 --> 02:11:37,63
快,快

2593
02:11:37,66 --> 02:11:37,77
我们已到位

2594
02:11:37,80 --> 02:11:40,73
收到

2595
02:11:40,77 --> 02:11:44,73
准备好

2596
02:11:44,77 --> 02:11:50,70
来啊

2597
02:11:51,40 --> 02:11:52,78
-Yeah. -Hey:

2598
02:11:53,74 --> 02:11:55,74
发现目标
Go get him.

2599
02:11:55,78 --> 02:11:57,95
Spearman,原地待命
-Whatever you want to do, baby. -One second.

2600
02:11:58,00 --> 02:12:02,83
楼道里有平民
-It's Frank. -Yeah.

2601
02:12:02,87 --> 02:12:04,88
什么?
Yeah.

2602
02:12:04,92 --> 02:12:07,68
好样的
Newark.

2603
02:12:07,71 --> 02:12:13,68
- 嗨Tim - 姑娘,怎么不多穿点衣服
Short term,

2604
02:12:09,17 --> 02:12:11,38
parking lot three.

2605
02:12:11,55 --> 02:12:13,26
Short term, lot three.

2606
02:12:13,43 --> 02:12:16,60
That's the Mustang we talking about, right? Okay, right. What's the plate number?

2607
02:12:16,77 --> 02:12:19,14
-K-A... -K-A...

2608
02:12:19,31 --> 02:12:21,52
:: 760: ::: 76:

2609
02:12:21,65 --> 02:12:23,27
Zero: All right:

2610
02:12:24,61 --> 02:12:26,57
There's no short term lot three at Newark.

2611
02:12:26,73 --> 02:12:28,95
-They got letters. A-B-C-D. -I know.

2612
02:12:29,90 --> 02:12:31,82
你往哪儿踢阿
Maybe he means a time. 3:00?

2613
02:12:31,86 --> 02:12:34,83
来来来
This isn't no Jersey licence plate, nor New York, for that matter.

2614
02:12:34,87 --> 02:12:38,74
我去捡球

2615
02:12:36,45 --> 02:12:39,21
-K-A-7-6-0? -Yep.

2616
02:12:38,79 --> 02:12:44,75
- 他人呢? - 孩子别说话

2617
02:12:40,38 --> 02:12:42,00
Kilo Alpha?

2618
02:12:42,46 --> 02:12:44,09
A plane tail number?

2619
02:12:44,50 --> 02:12:46,46
Kilo Alpha 760.

2620
02:12:48,96 --> 02:12:53,76
想听听这个么,伙计们
You check commercial planes. You guys check private planes.

2621
02:12:50,55 --> 02:12:53,14
Everything, from a little fucking Cessna to the biggest fucking whatever jet.

2622
02:12:53,79 --> 02:12:57,36
Time跑哪儿去了?
All right?

2623
02:12:54,52 --> 02:12:55,98
I'll check military planes. Where you going, Jimmy?

2624
02:12:57,40 --> 02:13:00,93
Tim总是到处瞎闹
You're not going anywhere. Sit... Sit down.

2625
02:13:00,97 --> 02:13:04,77
哥们,你有没有蓝色魔法呀?!

2626
02:13:04,81 --> 02:13:06,81
哪来的混球

2627
02:13:06,85 --> 02:13:08,82
去处理一下

2628
02:13:08,86 --> 02:13:12,40
哥们我有钱

2629
02:13:12,44 --> 02:13:15,95
你认识我,我需要磕点蓝色魔法

2630
02:13:15,99 --> 02:13:20,66
哥们给我来点儿吧

2631
02:13:20,70 --> 02:13:23,66
1,2,3
-Captain? -Yeah?

2632
02:13:23,70 --> 02:13:25,75
- 警察! - 警察
Richie Roberts. Essex County. I know you're expecting us.

2633
02:13:25,79 --> 02:13:27,77
- 放下武器 - 趴下,趴下

2634
02:13:27,81 --> 02:13:29,75
- 放下枪 - 别动,不要动
Here's our warrant. We're looking on the plane.

2635
02:13:29,80 --> 02:13:32,80
我们上
Wait! Wait!

2636
02:13:31,43 --> 02:13:34,77
Scotty, stop all these soldiers! Check their bags. Every one of them.

2637
02:13:37,38 --> 02:13:41,81
警察

2638
02:13:41,85 --> 02:13:44,82
你他妈的混蛋

2639
02:13:44,85 --> 02:13:50,82
警察,不许动
No-knock warrant.

2640
02:13:47,74 --> 02:13:50,29
-All right. Start upstairs. -Where are they going?

2641
02:13:50,41 --> 02:13:51,96
Step in, sweetie.

2642
02:13:52,37 --> 02:13:53,92
Ma'am, please sit down.

2643
02:13:54,08 --> 02:13:55,46
What is this?

2644
02:13:56,78 --> 02:14:00,83
不许动
Whoa, whoa, whoa! All this stops! Hey. Hey. Hey.

2645
02:14:00,87 --> 02:14:06,83
警察!
Nothing leaves this area, all right? Just slow down with this.

2646
02:14:03,05 --> 02:14:05,01
-All right. Stop these trucks. Hold on, hold on.

2647
02:14:05,14 --> 02:14:07,01
Everything off the walls! Just pull it all down.

2648
02:14:07,96 --> 02:14:10,71
把手举起来,所有人把手举起来
Damn thing's a monster, Rich.

2649
02:14:08,47 --> 02:14:09,48
What is this?

2650
02:14:10,75 --> 02:14:14,68
我们是警察
Nothing leaves this area till we've checked it.

2651
02:14:10,94 --> 02:14:12,23
All right, Captain. Nothing.

2652
02:14:12,40 --> 02:14:14,44
We got to take the plane down, we got to look in the trucks.

2653
02:14:14,72 --> 02:14:17,84
蹲下,蹲下,都他妈蹲下
Every man here gets searched.

2654
02:14:15,86 --> 02:14:17,65
Read the warrant, sir.

2655
02:14:18,40 --> 02:14:21,15
Your husband's illustrious career is over.

2656
02:14:21,70 --> 02:14:24,87
The Feds are gonna come in, gonna take everything.

2657
02:14:25,28 --> 02:14:29,50
And then they're gonna take it all. But not before I get my gratuity.

2658
02:14:30,37 --> 02:14:31,58
So where's the money?

2659
02:14:31,75 --> 02:14:33,21
What are you talking about? What money?

2660
02:14:33,34 --> 02:14:34,96
What am I talking about? What money?

2661
02:14:35,09 --> 02:14:39,13
The getaway money that Frank and every other gangster keeps in his house.

2662
02:14:39,30 --> 02:14:43,05
If you leave now, there's a chance Frank might not kill you.

2663
02:14:44,39 --> 02:14:45,93
Shut up! Sit down!

2664
02:14:46,10 --> 02:14:47,35
Sit down!

2665
02:15:28,06 --> 02:15:30,36
Defence today announced the planned evacuation

2666
02:15:30,52 --> 02:15:33,53
of all remaining US combat forces from Vietnam,

2667
02:15:32,79 --> 02:15:33,92
趴下,混帐,趴下
news that comes too late for some,

2668
02:15:33,96 --> 02:15:37,82
手,手别动

2669
02:15:36,49 --> 02:15:40,08
as here, on a solemn tarmac at Dover Air Force Base:

2670
02:15:40,24 --> 02:15:43,75
This C-130, loaded down with its sorrowful cargo,

2671
02:15:41,76 --> 02:15:47,72
该回家了,孩子

2672
02:15:43,87 --> 02:15:48,00
a cargo of America's bravest and best, en route to their final resting places:

2673
02:15:53,81 --> 02:15:57,73
谢谢

2674
02:15:57,77 --> 02:16:01,66
待在这儿,妈妈

2675
02:16:03,77 --> 02:16:05,31
You guys. Take this coffin down.

2676
02:16:13,78 --> 02:16:15,41
-Open it. -I'm not doing that.

2677
02:16:22,21 --> 02:16:24,08
Great fucking dog, huh?

2678
02:16:23,93 --> 02:16:28,68
- Lucas夫人,请进去 - 夫人,请进屋里去

2679
02:16:28,72 --> 02:16:34,69
请进去,谢谢

2680
02:16:32,14 --> 02:16:34,01
You stop this, right now.

2681
02:16:34,18 --> 02:16:37,52
My warrant gives me permission to examine this plane,

2682
02:16:38,52 --> 02:16:40,23
the plane and its cargo.

2683
02:16:40,35 --> 02:16:42,81
Well, you don't have my permission.

2684
02:16:42,91 --> 02:16:48,83
都退后
I don't need it, Captain.

2685
02:16:46,48 --> 02:16:50,24
Easy! Easy, boy. Come on. Hey! Easy!

2686
02:16:50,41 --> 02:16:52,53
Frank, move out of the way.

2687
02:16:55,71 --> 02:16:59,88
纽约警察,每个人都不许动

2688
02:16:59,08 --> 02:17:00,33
Damn.

2689
02:17:05,21 --> 02:17:06,67
That's enough!

2690
02:17:14,22 --> 02:17:16,19
Stay with these coffins. Do not let them out of your sight.

2691
02:17:16,31 --> 02:17:17,85
Got it. Okay.

2692
02:17:19,23 --> 02:17:21,36
Hey. Help me out with this.

2693
02:17:46,01 --> 02:17:48,39
That was a military transport plane.

2694
02:17:48,60 --> 02:17:49,68
If there was heroin onboard,

2695
02:17:49,85 --> 02:17:51,64
then someone in the military would have to be involved.

2696
02:17:51,77 --> 02:17:56,23
Which means that even as it fights a war that's claimed 50,000 American lives,

2697
02:17:55,81 --> 02:17:58,81
女士们先生们,随着本案的继续
the military is smuggling narcotics.

2698
02:17:58,85 --> 02:18:01,82
陪审团顾问已经准备好听取公开发言
That is how this event today will be interpreted.

2699
02:18:01,94 --> 02:18:07,86
检方代表Roberts先生会率先发言
That someone employed by this office

2700
02:18:03,32 --> 02:18:06,83
believes that the United States Army is in the drug trafficking business

2701
02:18:07,91 --> 02:18:13,75
Roberts先生,你准备好了么
and is trying to prove it by desecrating the remains of young men

2702
02:18:10,41 --> 02:18:13,25
who have given their lives in the defence of democracy!

2703
02:18:13,79 --> 02:18:19,67
是的,法官大人
-There is dope on that plane. -Shut the fuck up!

2704
02:18:17,46 --> 02:18:20,80
Is it any wonder, then, because of your actions,

2705
02:18:19,71 --> 02:18:25,67
女士们先生们,陪审团的各位你们好
the entire federal narcotics programme is now in jeopardy

2706
02:18:23,22 --> 02:18:26,14
of being dismantled as completely and enthusiastically

2707
02:18:25,92 --> 02:18:29,89
你们所将听到的这份发言会说明
as that fucking transport plane?

2708
02:18:28,22 --> 02:18:30,69
That is what you've accomplished, Mr Roberts, single-handedly.

2709
02:18:29,93 --> 02:18:33,85
Frank Lucas是我们这个国家里
I had good information.

2710
02:18:33,89 --> 02:18:38,90
逍遥法外的最危险的人物
That the target of my investigation was bringing dope in on that plane.

2711
02:18:36,61 --> 02:18:38,49
-And that target is? -Frank Lucas.

2712
02:18:38,94 --> 02:18:44,90
你们出去,让我和Richie先生单独谈谈
-Who? -His name's Frank Lucas.

2713
02:18:40,82 --> 02:18:43,37
Who is Frank Lucas? Who does he work for? Which family?

2714
02:18:43,49 --> 02:18:45,54
He's not Italian. He's black.

2715
02:18:45,86 --> 02:18:51,83
快点快点,我给你们是按小时付费,不是按分钟

2716
02:18:48,87 --> 02:18:51,71
Is that supposed to be some kind of a joke?

2717
02:18:51,99 --> 02:18:57,96
谢谢
You're this close to the end of your career in law enforcement

2718
02:18:54,21 --> 02:18:56,76
and you're making fucking jokes?

2719
02:18:56,92 --> 02:18:59,13
My investigation indicates

2720
02:18:58,83 --> 02:19:01,71
你身上没装窃听器把
that Frank Lucas is above the Mafia in the dope business.

2721
02:19:01,75 --> 02:19:03,84
没有
My investigations also indicate

2722
02:19:03,88 --> 02:19:09,84
好,我律师告诉我一件事,我不能相信
that Frank Lucas buys direct from a source in Southeast Asia.

2723
02:19:08,77 --> 02:19:11,86
He cuts out the middlemen and uses US military planes

2724
02:19:10,76 --> 02:19:15,77
你真的在汽车后备箱发现了一百万美元并把它上交了?
and personnel to transport pure number 4 heroin into the United States

2725
02:19:15,80 --> 02:19:16,69
- 对 - 你真的那么做了?
and he's been doing so on a regular basis since 1969.

2726
02:19:16,73 --> 02:19:18,81
兄弟

2727
02:19:18,85 --> 02:19:20,86
真是好样的,我操
I have cases against every member of Frank's organisation.

2728
02:19:20,90 --> 02:19:23,73
- 不过你知道Johnny把这钱都放进自己腰包了,对么 - 也许

2729
02:19:23,77 --> 02:19:27,90
不是什么也许,Roberts先生 你知道他拿了,他拿了你上交的钱
Frank's organisation?

2730
02:19:24,37 --> 02:19:28,12
No fucking nigger has ever accomplished what the American Mafia hasn't in 100 years!

2731
02:19:27,94 --> 02:19:29,86
你一分也没捞着,对不对
And you would know that how? Why?

2732
02:19:29,91 --> 02:19:31,83
你为什么这么做
'Cause your head is stuck up your fucking ass?

2733
02:19:31,87 --> 02:19:34,79
- 我所做的是正确的 - 说的对
Hey, Lou, do me a favour. Will you get this fucking kike out of here?

2734
02:19:34,83 --> 02:19:37,75
很好的答案,你所做的是正确的. 我的问题
Kike? Kike?

2735
02:19:35,30 --> 02:19:36,38
Richie, no.

2736
02:19:37,78 --> 02:19:41,35
我一直在问自己的问题是 如果再有这种情况,你还会这样做么?

2737
02:19:41,39 --> 02:19:44,92
那是一大笔钱,那是很久以前
Hey, Richie!

2738
02:19:42,47 --> 02:19:43,93
Make it stick.

2739
02:19:44,96 --> 02:19:50,68
你现在也许有很多购车贷款和孩子的抚养费要付清
Spearman's with the coffins. They're about a quarter mile away.

2740
02:19:50,72 --> 02:19:56,24
所以我想找出答案的唯一办法就是再试一次

2741
02:19:56,28 --> 02:20:01,77
贿赂,勒索,谋杀

2742
02:20:03,81 --> 02:20:08,86
告诉我地址,我保证车停在那里 我保证钱在车的后备箱里

2743
02:20:08,90 --> 02:20:13,79
- 不,谢了 - 你确信?

2744
02:20:13,82 --> 02:20:16,75
得了吧Richie,你以为这样就会打动我?

2745
02:20:16,79 --> 02:20:20,87
你认为你比别人正直,但你不比其他警察更好 实际上你和他们都一样
Doctor.

2746
02:20:20,91 --> 02:20:22,84
你就是他们
What?

2747
02:20:22,87 --> 02:20:24,71
我来问问你
Fucking Trupo came by the house, man. It's bad.

2748
02:20:24,75 --> 02:20:29,72
你真的认为把我抓进监狱 能够改变外面的情况么?

2749
02:20:29,76 --> 02:20:33,72
为了毒品,他们会去杀人,偷窃 他们会为毒品去死

2750
02:20:33,76 --> 02:20:36,72
我在或不在牢里改变不了任何事

2751
02:20:36,76 --> 02:20:38,85
- 事实就是如此 - 既然事实就是如此

2752
02:20:38,88 --> 02:20:39,89
哪我们又得到了什么呢? Richie

2753
02:20:39,93 --> 02:20:41,86
你和我坐在这里
Frankie, I need to speak with you a minute. Please?

2754
02:20:41,89 --> 02:20:46,77
还有那个给我兄弟开车的告密司机 你还得到了一些白粉

2755
02:20:44,29 --> 02:20:46,84
-I got to go, Ma. -No, sit down just a minute.

2756
02:20:46,82 --> 02:20:48,86
你需要更多的东西才能告倒我,Richie
Would you please come back a little later?

2757
02:20:48,90 --> 02:20:52,79
我有赃物,清楚货源,了解你们的阴谋
Thank you.

2758
02:20:50,38 --> 02:20:52,76
-Ma, I got to go. All right? -Just a few words.

2759
02:20:52,82 --> 02:20:56,91
我知道你在贿赂一名司法人员 还有证人证明你是个冷血的杀人犯
Listen to me. I got...

2760
02:20:54,47 --> 02:20:56,77
Please, sit down. Just a few words.

2761
02:20:56,95 --> 02:21:00,79
我有你的海外帐号,你的房产,你的生意
I've been thinking about some things.

2762
02:20:58,56 --> 02:21:02,15
You know, if you'd been a preacher, your brothers would have been preachers.

2763
02:21:00,82 --> 02:21:03,92
所有的一切都是你用海洛因换来的
Right.

2764
02:21:03,96 --> 02:21:06,84
我有成百死去青少年的父母
If you'd been a soldier, they'd be soldiers. You know that.

2765
02:21:06,88 --> 02:21:11,67
他们的孩子因为你的产品而深染毒瘾 这是我要告诉陪审团的故事
They came here because of you. You called and they came running.

2766
02:21:11,71 --> 02:21:13,63
这个人谋杀了上千条人命
Right.

2767
02:21:13,68 --> 02:21:14,89
而他却享受着豪宅靓车
That's because they look up to you.

2768
02:21:14,93 --> 02:21:17,68
你就不用担心多余的事情了
They always expect you to know what's best.

2769
02:21:17,72 --> 02:21:19,77
干得不错,Richie,不过那就是我们上法庭的目的

2770
02:21:19,81 --> 02:21:21,77
因为我也有我的证人
But even they know

2771
02:21:21,81 --> 02:21:26,77
我有名人和体育明星,我有整个哈林区,Richie
you don't shoot cops.

2772
02:21:26,81 --> 02:21:30,73
我照顾整个哈林区所以整个哈林区 也会支持我,你要相信这一点,Richie
Even I know that.

2773
02:21:30,77 --> 02:21:32,78
- 我还有更多 - 你还有什么
-Eva knows it. -All right, Ma.

2774
02:21:30,93 --> 02:21:33,47
The only one who doesn't seem to know is you!

2775
02:21:32,82 --> 02:21:36,87
我有整队的人要指证你 他们挤破了门
All right, Ma. I got to go. I promise you, I ain't gonna shoot nobody.

2776
02:21:36,90 --> 02:21:40,83
你手上沾满了血腥,Frank
I never asked you where all this came from because I didn't want to hear you lie.

2777
02:21:40,87 --> 02:21:43,87
Mozzano家族的人也会为我作证 你还记得那两个小伙子么
I didn't want you to worry about it. Now, come on, I got to go.

2778
02:21:43,91 --> 02:21:46,79
我和Mozzano没关系,Mozzano和我也没任何连系
Don't lie to me!

2779
02:21:46,83 --> 02:21:48,67
- 他们所有的事都和你有关系 - 不是这样

2780
02:21:48,71 --> 02:21:49,75
- 你知道为什么吗? - 为什么
Don't do that.

2781
02:21:49,80 --> 02:21:51,85
因为他们实际上对你恨之入骨

2782
02:21:51,88 --> 02:21:55,93
- 对你所代表的东西同样恨之入骨 - 我不代表任何东西,只代表Frank Lucas
Do you want to make things so bad

2783
02:21:55,97 --> 02:21:57,68
你真的这么想?
for your family that they'll leave you? Because they will.

2784
02:21:57,72 --> 02:21:59,76
黑人商人喜欢你么?
They'll understand.

2785
02:21:59,81 --> 02:22:01,81
你所代表的是一种变化
She will leave you.

2786
02:22:01,85 --> 02:22:05,69
这种变化会让他们损失很多钱
All right, Mama.

2787
02:22:05,73 --> 02:22:09,90
除掉你以后,一切事情都会恢复平常
I will leave you!

2788
02:22:09,93 --> 02:22:15,82
兄弟

2789
02:22:15,86 --> 02:22:21,83
你知道"平常"对我来说意味着什么么?Richie 我从6岁开始就没见过"平常"的事

2790
02:22:22,70 --> 02:22:28,67
"平常"的看到警察开车来到我家 把我12岁的表哥拖出来绑在柱子上

2791
02:22:28,88 --> 02:22:31,88
用枪在他嘴里猛捣,把他的牙齿都打断

2792
02:22:31,91 --> 02:22:36,84
然后他们用两发子弹轰开了他的脑壳 这就是我所知道的"平常"

2793
02:22:35,38 --> 02:22:36,71
Got coffins on the move, Richie.

2794
02:22:36,88 --> 02:22:41,85
我从此就开始憎恨... 开始憎恨该死的警察
We want the transport coffins, not the ceremonial ones.

2795
02:22:41,88 --> 02:22:43,68
操他妈的
Who are these guys?

2796
02:22:43,72 --> 02:22:45,77
你想干什么随你的便
What does it say?

2797
02:22:45,81 --> 02:22:51,77
因为我根本不在乎,那怕你明天脑袋开花我都无所谓

2798
02:22:49,60 --> 02:22:52,15
Bayonne Custodial Services?

2799
02:22:52,77 --> 02:22:58,74
省省吧Frank,这只会再为你增加一条罪状
Bayonne Cleaning Services?

2800
02:22:54,02 --> 02:22:55,19
Bayonne? What the fuck is that?

2801
02:22:55,32 --> 02:22:57,11
Give me the camera, Al.

2802
02:22:59,78 --> 02:23:04,87
好
Bingo.

2803
02:23:01,03 --> 02:23:03,78
Holy shit. That's the baseball kid.

2804
02:23:04,91 --> 02:23:10,88
你想怎么样
Oh, yeah. That's Stevie Lucas.

2805
02:23:06,04 --> 02:23:08,58
So what you want to do, Richie? Follow the trucks?

2806
02:23:08,75 --> 02:23:11,83
No. No. I wanna stay here with the Lucas kid.

2807
02:23:12,92 --> 02:23:14,80
你知道你应该怎么做
We'll follow that van.

2808
02:23:14,84 --> 02:23:18,76
你想要我干什么,告密? 我知道你不想让我揭发条子
You guys better eat up. We're gonna have a long night.

2809
02:23:18,79 --> 02:23:20,76
你想要什么,黑帮分子?

2810
02:23:20,80 --> 02:23:21,89
挑一个把

2811

犹太帮,法国帮,爱尔兰帮

2812
02:23:24,85 --> 02:23:30,73
他们从来到哈林区的那天起就在流血厮杀 Richie,我才不在乎什么罪犯头子

2813
02:23:27,89 --> 02:23:31,82
Come on, more precious than gold, man. This is more precious than gold.

2814
02:23:30,77 --> 02:23:33,94
- 我可以告诉你 - 这些我也要
We got a couple more. Let's go. Stack that up.

2815
02:23:33,98 --> 02:23:39,91
这些你"也"要?

2816
02:23:35,49 --> 02:23:37,45
Take it. Take it.

2817
02:23:37,57 --> 02:23:39,95
Give me a second, man, give me a second.

2818
02:23:41,70 --> 02:23:45,74
不,你不是,你是想要条子 你是在说条子么?
Hey. Yo. We got four caskets left, man. Let's make some fucking money in here.

2819
02:23:45,79 --> 02:23:48,80
- 你要抓你的同类? - 他们不是我的同类

2820
02:23:48,83 --> 02:23:53,29
他们是和你打交道,他们不是我的同类
What are they loading in there?

2821
02:23:48,58 --> 02:23:49,75
What the fuck are they loading in there?

2822
02:23:49,92 --> 02:23:50,92
That's the dope.

2823
02:23:51,09 --> 02:23:54,01
That's got to be the dope! It's got to be.

2824
02:23:53,33 --> 02:23:57,76
他们不是我的同类就好比 意大利人不是你的同类一样,明白么?
Let's go.

2825
02:23:56,84 --> 02:23:58,30
Let's move.

2826
02:24:08,98 --> 02:24:14,66
Richie,你能给我什么承诺

2827
02:24:14,69 --> 02:24:19,90
我可以承诺,如果你在任何一个名字上撒谎 你永远不会走出监狱

2828
02:24:19,95 --> 02:24:25,37
如果你隐瞒了那怕一美元或一个海外帐号 你永远不会走出监狱

2829
02:24:25,40 --> 02:24:30,79
你可以选择在监狱中富裕的度过余生

2830
02:24:30,83 --> 02:24:35,31
或作一个一文不名的自由人

2831
02:24:35,35 --> 02:24:39,76
这就是我能承诺的

2832
02:24:39,80 --> 02:24:43,80
我要你抓住那些条子,Richie

2833
02:24:43,84 --> 02:24:49,77
我要那些从我的口袋中拿钱的条子

2834

这些家伙全都有关联
Are you sure this is it? You're positive?

2841

Hey, Tim.

2879
02:28:15,26 --> 02:28:17,39

02:31:17,63 --> 02:31:19,92
Hey, man, what's going on?

2915
02:31:25,18 --> 02:31:26,64
What the hell...

2916
02:31:39,16 --> 02:31:41,45
Stay down! Down, motherfucker! Stay down!

2917
02:31:41,62 --> 02:31:43,16
Hands! Hands!

2918
02:31:48,08 --> 02:31:49,79
Out at home, baby.

2919
02:32:01,01 --> 02:32:03,31
-Thank you very much. -You're welcome.

2920
02:32:03,52 --> 02:32:05,98
Y'all wait right here. Wait right here.

2921
02:32:30,63 --> 02:32:33,22
-Mrs Lucas, please step back inside. -Yes, Officer.

2922
02:32:33,38 --> 02:32:34,63
Please, Mother Lucas, step inside, please.

2923
02:32:34,80 --> 02:32:38,14
Respectfully, ma'am, please step inside. Thank you. Step inside.

2924
02:32:49,48 --> 02:32:51,86
Hands up against the wall. Stay back.

2925
02:32:54,24 --> 02:32:55,57
Oh, man.

2926
02:32:55,70 --> 02:32:58,41
Don't you owe me money? I'll get you some more. Here you go.

2927
02:33:00,25 --> 02:33:02,29
Yo, yo! Pigs! Look out!

2928
02:33:02,46 --> 02:33:04,50
NYPD! Everybody stand still!

2929
02:33:07,59 --> 02:33:09,13
Turner! Go!

2930
02:33:10,63 --> 02:33:12,68
Down on the ground, motherfucker!

2931
02:33:46,84 --> 02:33:51,47
...dead servicemen returning from defending our country in Vietnam...

2932
02:33:54,01 --> 02:33:56,93
Over there. Okay.

2933
02:34:02,52 --> 02:34:05,44
Ladies and gentlemen, at this stage of the proceedings

2934
02:34:05,61 --> 02:34:08,86
the counsels are ready for their opening statements.

2935
02:34:09,03 --> 02:34:12,04
For the prosecution, Mr Roberts will proceed

2936
02:34:12,20 --> 02:34:14,41
with his opening statement first.

2937
02:34:14,95 --> 02:34:18,79
Mr Roberts, are you ready to proceed?

2938
02:34:20,59 --> 02:34:22,21
Yes, Your Honour.

2939
02:34:26,13 --> 02:34:28,64
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

2940
02:34:33,06 --> 02:34:36,90
the State will show and you will hear

2941
02:34:37,06 --> 02:34:40,90
that Frank Lucas is the most dangerous man

2942
02:34:41,03 --> 02:34:43,24
walking the streets of our city.

2943
02:34:46,03 --> 02:34:49,95
All right, y'all, get on out. Let me talk to Mr Richie alone.

2944
02:34:53,04 --> 02:34:57,25
Come on, come on, come on. I pay y'all by the hour, not by the minute.

2945
02:34:59,26 --> 02:35:00,55
Thank you.

2946
02:35:05,39 --> 02:35:07,76
You ain't wearing a wire, are you?

2947
02:35:08,43 --> 02:35:09,72
No.

2948
02:35:10,52 --> 02:35:13,44
All right. I was talking to my lawyers.

2949
02:35:13,56 --> 02:35:16,48
They said something to me, I can't believe it.

2950
02:35:17,44 --> 02:35:20,61
Did you really find a million dollars in the trunk of a car

2951
02:35:20,78 --> 02:35:22,49
-and then turn it in? Did you do that? -Yeah.

2952
02:35:22,61 --> 02:35:23,99
You did that for real, huh?

2953
02:35:24,12 --> 02:35:27,45
My man. Good for you. Shit.

2954
02:35:27,62 --> 02:35:29,66
You know Johnny Law got it though, right?

2955
02:35:29,79 --> 02:35:31,75
-Maybe. -Ain't no maybe about it, Mr Richie.

2956
02:35:31,88 --> 02:35:34,09
You know he got it. You turned that money in,

2957
02:35:34,21 --> 02:35:36,88
he took it and you ain't get nothing for it. Did you?

2958
02:35:37,01 --> 02:35:38,72
Why did you do that?

2959
02:35:38,84 --> 02:35:41,59
-It was the right thing to do. -That's true.

2960
02:35:41,76 --> 02:35:43,39
That's a good answer. It was the right thing to do.

2961
02:35:43,55 --> 02:35:45,68
The question I have, the question I've been asking myself is,

2962
02:35:45,85 --> 02:35:47,64
would you do it again?

2963
02:35:48,73 --> 02:35:51,90
I mean, that's a lot of money, that's a long time ago.

2964
02:35:52,06 --> 02:35:55,57
Many car payments ago, many child support payments ago.

2965
02:35:57,36 --> 02:36:01,20
So I said to myself, the onlyest way to find out is to find out.

2966
02:36:02,74 --> 02:36:08,50
Bribery, extortion, murder, racketeering...

2967
02:36:10,58 --> 02:36:12,21
Now, you give me an address,

2968
02:36:12,34 --> 02:36:15,76
I'll make sure the car's there, I'll make sure that money's in that trunk.

2969
02:36:15,92 --> 02:36:17,38
No, thanks.

2970
02:36:17,51 --> 02:36:18,80
You sure?

2971
02:36:20,68 --> 02:36:23,52
Come on, now, Richie. What do you think, that impresses me?

2972
02:36:23,68 --> 02:36:26,39
You think that you're better than them? You ain't no better than them other cops.

2973
02:36:26,52 --> 02:36:29,86
In fact, you're the same as them. You are them.

2974
02:36:30,02 --> 02:36:31,02
Let me ask you this.

2975
02:36:31,19 --> 02:36:34,36
Do you really think that putting me behind bars

2976
02:36:34,53 --> 02:36:36,32
is going to change anything on them streets?

2977
02:36:36,45 --> 02:36:37,91
Them dope fiends is gonna shoot it,

2978
02:36:38,03 --> 02:36:40,24
they're gonna steal for it, they're gonna die for it.

2979
02:36:40,41 --> 02:36:43,50
Putting me in or out ain't gonna change one thing.

2980
02:36:43,62 --> 02:36:44,79
Then that's the way it is.

2981
02:36:44,92 --> 02:36:46,96
That's just the way it is. So what we got, Richie?

2982
02:36:47,08 --> 02:36:49,29
We got me and you sitting here.

2983
02:36:49,46 --> 02:36:51,92
We got that little snitch-ass driver for my brother:

2984
02:36:52,05 --> 02:36:53,93
You got a little bit of powder:

2985
02:36:54,05 --> 02:36:55,76
You're going to need more than that, Richie:

2986
02:36:55,93 --> 02:36:59,43
I got possession, supply, conspiracy,

2987
02:36:59,64 --> 02:37:03,69
bribing a law officer: I got people who'll attest to seeing you kill in cold blood:

2988
02:37:03,85 --> 02:37:07,77
I got your offshore bank accounts, your real estate, your businesses,

2989
02:37:07,90 --> 02:37:10,82
all bought with money from heroin.

2990
02:37:10,94 --> 02:37:13,78
And I got hundreds of parents of dead kids.

2991
02:37:13,91 --> 02:37:16,37
Addicts who OD'ed on your product. And that's my story for the jury.

2992
02:37:16,49 --> 02:37:20,16
And that's how I make it all stick. "This man murdered thousands of people.

2993
02:37:20,29 --> 02:37:22,17
"And he did it from a penthouse, driving a Lincoln."

2994
02:37:22,29 --> 02:37:24,00
Aside from that, you got nothing to worry about.

2995
02:37:24,17 --> 02:37:27,00
That's pretty good. But that's why we go to court, isn't it, Richie?

2996
02:37:27,13 --> 02:37:28,67
'Cause I got witnesses, too.

2997
02:37:28,80 --> 02:37:32,72
I got celebrities. I got sports figures. I got Harlem, Richie.

2998
02:37:33,30 --> 02:37:37,06
I took care of Harlem, so Harlem's gonna take care of me. You can believe that.

2999
02:37:37,22 --> 02:37:39,68
-I got more than that, Frank. -What you got?

3000
02:37:39,81 --> 02:37:42,48
I've got a line of people wanting to testify against you,

3001
02:37:42,61 --> 02:37:44,90
it stretches out the door and around the block.

3002
02:37:45,07 --> 02:37:48,82
You damaged a lot of lives, Frank: I got the Mazzano crime family:

3003
02:37:48,99 --> 02:37:50,53
Remember those boys? You put them out of business:

3004
02:37:50,70 --> 02:37:52,07
I ain't got nothing to do with no Mazzanos.

3005
02:37:52,20 --> 02:37:53,37
Mazzanos ain't got nothing to do with me.

3006
02:37:53,53 --> 02:37:54,91
-They got everything to do with you. -What, they...

3007
02:37:55,04 --> 02:37:56,12
-You know why? -Why?

3008
02:37:56,29 --> 02:37:59,21
Because apart from the fact that they hate you personally,

3009
02:37:59,37 --> 02:38:00,54
they hate what you represent.

3010
02:38:00,71 --> 02:38:04,21
-I don't represent nothing but Frank Lucas. -You sure?

3011
02:38:04,38 --> 02:38:06,42
A black businessman like you?

3012
02:38:06,55 --> 02:38:08,68
You represent progress.

3013
02:38:08,84 --> 02:38:12,26
The kind of progress that's going to see them lose a lot of money.

3014
02:38:12,39 --> 02:38:15,89
With you out of the way, everything can return to normal.

3015
02:38:17,10 --> 02:38:18,27
My man.

3016
02:38:23,15 --> 02:38:25,44
You know what normal is to me, Richie?

3017
02:38:25,57 --> 02:38:28,57
I ain't seen normal since I was six years old.

3018
02:38:29,99 --> 02:38:32,54
Normal is seeing the police right up to my house

3019
02:38:32,70 --> 02:38:35,62
dragging my little 12-year-old cousin out, tying him to a pole,

3020
02:38:35,75 --> 02:38:38,84
shoving a shotgun in his mouth so hard they bust his teeth.

3021
02:38:39,00 --> 02:38:42,26
Then they bust two shotgun shells in his head and knock his fucking head off.

3022
02:38:42,38 --> 02:38:43,55
That's what normal is to me.

3023
02:38:43,71 --> 02:38:46,72
I didn't give a fuck about no police then.

3024
02:38:46,89 --> 02:38:49,81
I don't give a fuck about no police now. Shit.

3025
02:38:50,22 --> 02:38:52,43
You know what, you can do whatever you want to do.

3026
02:38:52,60 --> 02:38:55,06
So, it don't mean nothing to me for you to show up tomorrow morning

3027
02:38:55,23 --> 02:38:58,06
with your head blown off. Do you understand what I'm saying?

3028
02:38:58,23 --> 02:39:03,57
Yeah, Frank. Get in line. That one stretches around the block, too.

3029
02:39:06,99 --> 02:39:08,33
All right.

3030
02:39:12,16 --> 02:39:13,54
What do you want to do?

3031
02:39:20,17 --> 02:39:21,80
You know what you got to do.

3032
02:39:21,92 --> 02:39:23,63
What do you want me to do? Snitch, huh?

3033
02:39:23,80 --> 02:39:25,26
I know you don't want me to give up no cops.

3034
02:39:25,39 --> 02:39:27,43
What do you want? You want gangsters?

3035
02:39:27,56 --> 02:39:31,31
Pick one. Jew gangsters? Mick gangsters? Guineas?

3036
02:39:31,81 --> 02:39:34,52
They've been bleeding Harlem dry since they got off the boat, Richie.

3037
02:39:34,65 --> 02:39:38,40
I don't give a fuck about no crime figures. You can have them.

3038
02:39:39,53 --> 02:39:41,07
I'll take them, too.

3039
02:39:41,24 --> 02:39:43,12
You'll take them, too?

3040
02:39:48,29 --> 02:39:51,96
No, you didn't. You're talking about police. You want police?

3041
02:39:52,58 --> 02:39:53,59
You want your own kind?

3042
02:39:53,71 --> 02:39:55,59
They're not my kind.

3043
02:39:55,75 --> 02:39:58,42
They're in business with you, Frank. They ain't my kind.

3044
02:39:58,55 --> 02:40:02,39
They ain't my kind like the Italians are not yours. All right?

3045
02:40:05,72 --> 02:40:06,73
Huh.

3046
02:40:16,07 --> 02:40:18,45
What can you promise me, Richie?

3047
02:40:21,45 --> 02:40:24,87
I can promise you, you lie about one name,

3048
02:40:25,00 --> 02:40:26,87
you'll never get out of prison.

3049
02:40:27,00 --> 02:40:29,67
You lie about one dollar, in one offshore account,

3050
02:40:29,84 --> 02:40:32,05
you'll never get out of prison.

3051
02:40:33,21 --> 02:40:37,43
Now you can live life rich in jail for the rest of your born days,

3052
02:40:37,97 --> 02:40:40,51
or be poor outside for some of them.

3053
02:40:41,51 --> 02:40:43,81
That's what I can promise you.

3054
02:40:46,69 --> 02:40:52,78
I want them cops, Richie. That's what I want, I want them cops

3055
02:40:54,15 --> 02:40:57,32
that took that money out of my pockets.

3056
02:41:00,12 --> 02:41:01,66
Him, too.

3057
02:41:01,79 --> 02:41:03,66
All right. Okay.

3058
02:41:05,54 --> 02:41:07,75
Hey, Spearman? Spearman.

3059
02:41:08,46 --> 02:41:11,01
So these guys are all connected up to Gywnn, all right.

3060
02:41:11,17 --> 02:41:13,72
See this guy here, he's in uniform...

3061
02:41:14,63 --> 02:41:16,85
Four police officers were arrested today

3062
02:41:17,01 --> 02:41:19,47
on charges of taking bribes from drug traffickers:

3063
02:41:19,68 --> 02:41:20,85
Well done, Jimmy.

3064
02:41:20,98 --> 02:41:23,10
The investigation into police corruption

3065
02:41:23,23 --> 02:41:26,32
has swept through New York's drug enforcement ranks

3066
02:41:26,48 --> 02:41:29,82
broadened today with the arrest of 19 more officers:

3067
02:41:30,90 --> 02:41:34,57
In what is being called this city's largest police corruption scandal,

3068
02:41:34,74 --> 02:41:38,87
32 more officers were indicted today in federal court on bribery charges:

3069
02:41:39,04 --> 02:41:42,12
These police officers will face stiff prison terms,

3070
02:41:42,33 --> 02:41:45,17
say federal prosecutors, if found guilty:

3071
02:41:45,34 --> 02:41:47,80
A report by federal investigators into New York's

3072
02:41:47,92 --> 02:41:49,97
ever widening police corruption scandal

3073
02:41:50,13 --> 02:41:52,68
claims that more than half of the city's officers

3074
02:41:52,89 --> 02:41:57,02
assigned to drug enforcement have engaged in some form of corruption:

3075
02:41:58,06 --> 02:42:01,31
Allegations of widespread corruption within

3076
02:42:01,48 --> 02:42:03,86
the elite narcotics squad SIU

3077
02:42:04,07 --> 02:42:07,49
have led to the arrest of more New York City detectives:

3078
02:42:07,78 --> 02:42:09,03
Convicted of extortion,

3079
02:42:09,20 --> 02:42:12,37
members of New York City's Special Investigations Narcotics Unit

3080
02:42:12,57 --> 02:42:15,58
will face sentencing today in federal court:

3081
02:42:17,54 --> 02:42:20,38
MacNamara. Vendazzo.

3082
02:42:21,63 --> 02:42:22,88
Trupo.

3083
02:42:26,26 --> 02:42:27,63
You are special.

3084
02:43:11,14 --> 02:43:13,02
It's good work, Frank.

3085
02:43:14,27 --> 02:43:15,65
You know...

3086
02:43:15,85 --> 02:43:19,44
You don't want a drink or something? Celebrate?

3087
02:43:20,07 --> 02:43:21,94
You got any holy water?

3088
02:44:16,59 --> 02:44:19,26
Check your property. Sign, please.

3089
02:45:11,19 --> 02:45:14,53
Smell better out here?

3090
02:45:32,97 --> 02:45:35,43
Frank. There you are.

3091
02:45:36,26 --> 02:45:38,72
-Caffe latte. Yeah. -Latte?

3092
02:45:38,89 --> 02:45:41,73
-Oh, shit. Yeah. -You all right?

3093
02:45:41,94 --> 02:45:44,81
That's a fancy way of saying coffee with milk.

3094
02:45:44,98 --> 02:45:46,32
-Yeah. -$2.50.

3095
02:45:49,86 --> 02:45:52,24
So you been talking to your brothers?

3096
02:45:52,40 --> 02:45:55,74
No, no, I ain't talked to them in years. It's probably best for them.

3097
02:45:59,75 --> 02:46:04,13
What the hell am I going to do out here, Richie? I don't know how I'm gonna live.

3098
02:46:06,42 --> 02:46:09,42
Hey, I told ya, I ain't gonna let you starve, all right?

3099
02:46:09,59 --> 02:46:11,01
Obviously, you ain't starving.

3100
02:46:12,30 --> 02:46:15,31
Bagels and blinches. They will catch up with you, you know?

3101
02:46:19,56 --> 02:46:20,56
Who's this?

3102
02:46:21,27 --> 02:46:23,98
Expensive sneakers. About $100 a pair.

3103
02:46:33,41 --> 02:46:35,29
Frederick Douglass Boulevard.

3104
02:46:36,62 --> 02:46:40,04
This used to be Eighth Avenue, why do they call it Frederick Douglass Boulevard now?

3105
02:46:45,84 --> 02:46:48,84
This was me Richie, right here. This was all me.

3106
02:46:50,39 --> 02:46:52,51
In my day there were so many niggers out here buying dope

3107
02:46:52,64 --> 02:46:55,31
you could've made a Tarzan movie.

3108
02:46:56,06 --> 02:46:59,56
You know, one phone call, I'll be right back in business, you know that.

3109
02:46:59,69 --> 02:47:03,03
You don't do that, Frank. These days I keep all my promises.

3110
02:47:14,25 --> 02:47:16,54
Why'd you come and get me, huh?

3111
02:47:16,71 --> 02:47:18,59
You're a superstar, Frank.

3112
02:47:18,75 --> 02:47:19,92
A superstar?

3113
02:47:21,17 --> 02:47:25,22
Your evidence alone gave me 150 convictions.

3114
02:47:25,72 --> 02:47:28,72
Thought the least we could do is give you a ride home.

3115
02:47:29,14 --> 02:47:32,98
Yeah, you sure did that. You gave me a ride home. Free ride.

3116
02:47:33,52 --> 02:47:35,90
Coming to gangsters.

3117
02:47:39,69 --> 02:47:40,69
What?

3118
02:47:43,15 --> 02:47:46,08
Ain't nothin', man. Ain't nothin', man.

3119
02:47:46,91 --> 02:47:49,04
That's life right there. That's life right there.

3120
02:47:49,50 --> 02:47:52,67
Even a fool gets to be young once.
