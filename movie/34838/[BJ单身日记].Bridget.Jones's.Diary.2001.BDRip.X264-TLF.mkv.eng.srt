1
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:14,390
It all began
on New Year's Day...

2
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:17,660
in my 32nd year
of being single.

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,091
Once again I found myself
on my own...

4
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:25,860
and going to my mother's
annual turkey curry buffet.

5
00:00:25,932 --> 00:00:29,592
Every year she tries to fix me up with
some bushy-haired, middle-aged bore...

6
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:33,029
and I feared this year
would be no exception.

7
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,929
There you are, dumpling.

8
00:00:35,999 --> 00:00:38,090
My mum, a strange creature...

9
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:40,894
from the time when a gherkin
was still the height of sophistication.

10
00:00:40,966 --> 00:00:44,660
- Doilies, Pam? Hello, Bridget.
- Third drawer from the top, Una...

11
00:00:44,733 --> 00:00:46,665
under the minigherkins.

12
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:49,198
By the way,
the Darcys are here.

13
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:50,925
They brought Mark with them.

14
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:53,988
- Ah, here we go.
- You remember Mark.

15
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:57,430
You used to play in his paddling pool.
He's a barrister, very well off.

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,432
No, I don't remember.

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,489
He's divorced, apparently.

18
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:05,726
His wife was Japanese. Very cruel race.
Now, what are you going to put on?

19
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:08,865
- This.
- Don't be silly, Bridget.

20
00:01:08,932 --> 00:01:11,763
You'll never get a boyfriend if you look
like you've wandered out of Auschwitz.

21
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:14,560
Run upstairs.
Laid out something lovely on your bed.

22
00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:27,490
Great. I was wearing a carpet.

23
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:34,761
Here she is.
My little Bridget.

24
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,489
- Hi, Uncle Geoffrey.
- Have a drink?

25
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,555
- Come on, then.
- Actually, not my uncle.

26
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:44,894
Someone who insists I call him "Uncle"
while he gropes my ass...

27
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:47,831
and asks me the question
dreaded by all singletons.

28
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:51,093
So, how's your love life?

29
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:53,689
Super. Thanks, Uncle G.

30
00:01:53,766 --> 00:01:55,493
Still no fellow, then, eh?
All right, then.

31
00:01:55,566 --> 00:01:57,895
You career girls can't put it off
forever, you know.

32
00:01:57,966 --> 00:01:59,762
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

33
00:01:59,832 --> 00:02:02,264
- Hello, Dad.
- Hello, darling.

34
00:02:03,132 --> 00:02:05,564
- How's it going?
- Torture.

35
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:09,894
Your mother's trying to
fix you up with some divorce.

36
00:02:09,966 --> 00:02:13,091
Human rights barrister.
Pretty nasty beast, apparently.

37
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:16,197
Ding-dong.

38
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:19,323
Maybe this time
Mum had got it right.

39
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:22,831
Come on. Why don't we see
if Mark fancies a gherkin.

40
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:24,763
Good luck.

41
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:29,163
Maybe this was
the mysterious Mr. Right...

42
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:31,926
I'd been waiting
my whole life to meet.

43
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:35,157
You remember Bridget.

44
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:36,892
Maybe not.

45
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:39,796
She used to run around your lawn
with no clothes on, remember?

46
00:02:40,932 --> 00:02:42,921
No, not as such.

47
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:47,758
Come and look at your gravy, Pam.
I think it's going to need sieving.

48
00:02:47,832 --> 00:02:50,765
Of course it doesn't need sieving.
Just stir it, Una.

49
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:56,989
Yes, of course. I'll be right there.
Sorry. Lumpy gravy calls.

50
00:03:00,966 --> 00:03:03,989
- So.
- So.

51
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:07,191
Are you staying at your parents'
for New Year?

52
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:10,232
- Yes. You?
- Oh, no, no.

53
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:12,356
I was in London
at a party last night...

54
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:14,661
so I'm afraid
I'm a bit hung over.

55
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:18,165
Wish I could by lying with my head
in a toilet like all normal people.

56
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:24,491
New Year's resolution:
Drink less. Oh, and quit smoking.

57
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,125
And keep New Year's resolutions.

58
00:03:33,466 --> 00:03:38,660
And stop talking total nonsense
to strangers.

59
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:40,994
In fact,
stop talking full stop.

60
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:44,558
Yes, well, perhaps
it's time to eat.

61
00:03:48,132 --> 00:03:50,825
Apparently she lives
just around the corner from you.

62
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:53,388
Mother, I do not
need a blind date.

63
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:56,057
Particularly not with some
verbally incontinent spinster...

64
00:03:56,132 --> 00:03:59,825
who smokes like a chimney, drinks
like a fish and dresses like her mother.

65
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:07,996
Yummy. Turkey curry.
My favorite.

66
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:10,930
And that was it. Right there.

67
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:14,227
Right there.
That was the moment.

68
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,524
I suddenly realized that
unless something changed soon...

69
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,031
I was going to live a life
where my major relationship...

70
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:23,928
was with a bottle of wine...

71
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:27,056
and I'd finally die
fat and alone...

72
00:04:27,132 --> 00:04:31,189
and be found three weeks later
half-eaten by Alsatians.

73
00:04:31,266 --> 00:04:35,164
Or I was about to turn
into Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction.

74
00:04:36,832 --> 00:04:42,924
All by myself

75
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:44,862
Don't want to be

76
00:04:44,932 --> 00:04:49,524
All by myself

77
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,589
Anymore

78
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:54,992
You have no messages.

79
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,155
When I was young

80
00:05:24,665 --> 00:05:27,927
I never needed anyone

81
00:05:30,932 --> 00:05:34,262
And makin'love
was just for fun

82
00:05:36,832 --> 00:05:39,094
Those days are gone

83
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,555
All by myself

84
00:05:50,665 --> 00:05:52,427
Don't want to be

85
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,091
All by myself

86
00:05:57,099 --> 00:05:59,997
Anymore

87
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:30,056
And so I made a major decision.

88
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:32,597
I had to make sure that next year
I wouldn't end up shit-faced...

89
00:06:32,665 --> 00:06:37,257
and listening to sad FM,
easy listening for the over-30s.

90
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:41,594
I decided to take control
of my life and start a diary...

91
00:06:41,665 --> 00:06:45,722
to tell the truth
about BridgetJones, the whole truth.

92
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:51,358
Resolution number one:
Obviously we'll lose 20 pounds.

93
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:55,160
Number two: Always put last night's
pants in the laundry basket.

94
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:59,097
Equally important, will find nice,
sensible boyfriend to go out with...

95
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:02,689
and not continue to form romantic
attachments to any of the following:

96
00:07:02,765 --> 00:07:04,924
Alcoholics, workaholics,
commitment phobics...

97
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:08,488
Peeping Toms, megalomaniacs,
emotional fuckwits or perverts.

98
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:12,191
And especially will not fantasize
about a particular person...

99
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:15,720
who embodies all these things.

100
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:27,997
Unfortunately, he just
happens to be my boss...

101
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:31,930
editor in chief Daniel Cleaver, and
for various slightly unfair reasons...

102
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:34,227
relating to this year's
Christmas party...

103
00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:37,390
I suspect
he does not fantasize about me.

104
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,592
Can't live

105
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:48,029
Livin'is without you

106
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:52,554
I can't live

107
00:07:52,632 --> 00:07:55,962
- Can't give anymore
- Or maybe I'm wrong.

108
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:12,323
- Happy New Year, Mr. Fitzherbert.
- Happy New Year, Brenda.

109
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,092
Mr. Fitzherbert.
"Titspervert,"more like.

110
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:19,894
Daniel's boss stares at my breasts
with no idea who I am or what I do.

111
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:23,194
Morning. I need that
Kafka's Motorbike release by 11:00.

112
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:24,425
Perpetua.

113
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:28,057
Slightly senior, and therefore
thinks she's in charge of me.

114
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:31,928
Most of the time I just want
to staple things to her head.

115
00:08:33,465 --> 00:08:36,398
- Publicity.
- All I asked...

116
00:08:36,465 --> 00:08:39,159
I only asked if he wanted
to come on a minibreak to Paris.

117
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:41,062
Daily call from Jude.
Best friend.

118
00:08:41,132 --> 00:08:44,394
Head of investment at Brightlings Bank
who spends most of her time...

119
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:47,431
trapped in the ladies'toilet
crying over fuckwit boyfriend.

120
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:50,932
Am I too needy?
Am I codependent?

121
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:53,590
No, you're not. It's not you.

122
00:08:53,665 --> 00:08:56,722
You're lovely.
It's vile Richard.

123
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:59,391
He's just a big knobhead
with no knob.

124
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:05,822
Is some people's opinion
of Kafka...

125
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:07,762
but they couldn't be
more wrong.

126
00:09:07,832 --> 00:09:11,026
This book is a searing vision of
the wounds our century has inflicted...

127
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:13,327
on traditional masculinity.

128
00:09:13,398 --> 00:09:16,388
It's positively Vonnegutesque.

129
00:09:16,465 --> 00:09:18,329
Thank you for calling,
Professor Leavis.

130
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:22,765
Guest list
for launch party.

131
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:28,622
F.R. Leavis?

132
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,321
Wow.

133
00:09:33,765 --> 00:09:38,130
The F.R. Leavis who wrote
Mass Civilization and Minority Culture?

134
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:43,491
The F.R. Leavis
who died in 1978?

135
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:48,295
Amazing.

136
00:09:51,398 --> 00:09:52,887
Emergency summit
with urban family...

137
00:09:52,966 --> 00:09:55,194
for coherent discussion
of career crisis.

138
00:09:55,266 --> 00:09:57,527
Fuck 'em.
Fuck the lot of them.

139
00:09:57,599 --> 00:10:01,531
Tell them they can stick fucking Leavis
up their fucking asses.

140
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,531
Good, good.
That's very useful.

141
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:07,827
Shazzer, journalist.
Likes to say "fuck"a lot.

142
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,592
Jude, what would you do
if one of your assistants...

143
00:10:09,665 --> 00:10:12,358
made a harmless little mistake
like that?

144
00:10:12,432 --> 00:10:15,489
- I'd fire you, Bridge.
- Excellent.

145
00:10:15,565 --> 00:10:17,861
Is that Cleaver chap
still as cute as ever?

146
00:10:17,932 --> 00:10:19,397
Oh, God, yes.

147
00:10:19,465 --> 00:10:22,488
Then I think a well-timed blow job
is probably the best answer.

148
00:10:22,565 --> 00:10:25,725
- Oh, you love it.
- Are you the chap that sang that song?

149
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,822
Yes. Yes, I am.

150
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,661
Tom, '80s pop icon
who only wrote one hit record...

151
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:34,062
then retired because he found
that one record was quite enough...

152
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:36,427
to get him laid
for the whole of the '90s.

153
00:10:36,499 --> 00:10:39,590
- Well, great song.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

154
00:10:39,665 --> 00:10:42,097
- Total poof, of course.
- More vodka?

155
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:45,598
- No!
- Yes! Fill her up, goddamn it!

156
00:10:45,665 --> 00:10:48,460
At least now I'm in my 30s,
I can hold my drink.

157
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,223
- Oops!
- Mind the step.

158
00:10:53,298 --> 00:10:55,730
She's fine. Drive on.

159
00:10:57,665 --> 00:11:00,290
Apparently F.R. Leavis
is coming.

160
00:11:02,298 --> 00:11:04,287
Afternoon, Bridget.

161
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:07,460
What do you mean
you're going on holiday?

162
00:11:08,432 --> 00:11:10,398
What aboutJulia?

163
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,591
We've got a problem
with the Teddy Knows Best campaign.

164
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:47,755
The only problem is the kitchen.

165
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:52,560
- There isn't room to swing a cat.
- Message Mr. Cleaver.

166
00:11:52,632 --> 00:11:55,564
Am appalled by message.

167
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:59,224
Skirt is demonstrably
neither sick nor absent.

168
00:11:59,298 --> 00:12:04,095
Appalled by management's
blatantly size-ist attitude to skirt.

169
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:07,155
Suggest management sick,
not skirt!

170
00:12:20,398 --> 00:12:22,990
Right. Yeah.

171
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:26,554
No, I understand that.
I understand that perfectly.

172
00:12:32,265 --> 00:12:34,925
Very bad start to the year.

173
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:37,556
Have been seduced by informality
of messaging medium...

174
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,860
into flirting
with office scoundrel.

175
00:12:39,932 --> 00:12:44,160
Will persevere with resolution
to find a nice, sensible man.

176
00:12:44,232 --> 00:12:47,528
Will put a stop to flirting...
first thing tomorrow.

177
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,462
Good plan.

178
00:12:58,765 --> 00:13:01,560
If walking past office was attempt
to demonstrate presence of skirt...

179
00:13:01,632 --> 00:13:05,325
can only say that it
has failed parlously... Cleave.

180
00:13:05,398 --> 00:13:08,421
Shut up, please.
I am very busy and important.

181
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:13,659
P.S. How dare you sexually harass me
in this impertinent manner?

182
00:13:13,732 --> 00:13:16,357
MessageJones.
Mortified to have caused offense.

183
00:13:16,432 --> 00:13:21,024
Will avoid all non-P.C. Overtones
in future. Deeply apologetic.

184
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:23,122
P.S. Like your tits in that top.

185
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:29,663
Mustn't read too much
into it, though.

186
00:13:33,432 --> 00:13:36,398
And it all began, of course, with
some very irresponsible E-mailing...

187
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:38,829
over Bridget's nonexistent skirt.

188
00:13:49,966 --> 00:13:53,989
- The New York office for you.
- Yeah. Tell 'em I'll get back to 'em.

189
00:14:08,565 --> 00:14:10,428
- Evening, Kenneth.
- Evening.

190
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:17,594
If you've got a moment,
I'd like a word before you leave.

191
00:14:17,665 --> 00:14:19,563
Yes, certainly.

192
00:14:22,632 --> 00:14:24,257
- I'll see you in a sec.
- Excellent.

193
00:14:24,332 --> 00:14:25,992
- And, Brenda?
- Yes.

194
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:28,531
At the Kafka's Motorbike thing,
thought it might be fun...

195
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:30,929
if you introduce me
before I introduce him.

196
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:32,988
Add a lovely sense of occasion.

197
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,931
Certainly, sir.

198
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:44,424
- What are you doing tonight?
- Actually, I'm busy.

199
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:47,158
Right. Well,
that's a shame. I just...

200
00:14:48,298 --> 00:14:51,162
I thought it might be a charitable thing
to take your skirt out for dinner...

201
00:14:51,232 --> 00:14:53,028
and try and fatten it up a bit.

202
00:14:53,098 --> 00:14:54,997
Maybe you could come too.

203
00:14:56,131 --> 00:14:57,927
- What about tomorrow?
- No.

204
00:14:57,999 --> 00:15:01,089
- Tomorrow's the launch.
- Yes, of course.

205
00:15:01,165 --> 00:15:04,030
Possibly the worst book ever published.

206
00:15:04,098 --> 00:15:06,894
Well, in the end,
that's not the ad line we've gone for.

207
00:15:08,098 --> 00:15:10,621
- Next night.
- Let's see, shall we?

208
00:15:12,131 --> 00:15:13,722
'Night, Daniel.

209
00:15:14,398 --> 00:15:18,524
Right. No pressure, Bridge,
but your whole future happiness...

210
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:21,030
now depends on how you behave
on this one social occasion.

211
00:15:21,098 --> 00:15:25,087
- Right. What shall I do?
- First, look gorgeous.

212
00:15:39,966 --> 00:15:44,261
Two: Then totally ignore Daniel
and suck up to famous authors.

213
00:15:44,332 --> 00:15:46,059
Salman.

214
00:15:48,065 --> 00:15:50,224
Circulate...

215
00:15:50,298 --> 00:15:52,526
oozing intelligence.

216
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:54,588
Isn't it terrible
about Chechnya?

217
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,696
Introduce people
with thoughtful details, such as:

218
00:16:01,765 --> 00:16:05,094
Sheila, this is Daniel.
Daniel, this is Sheila.

219
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:08,029
Sheila enjoys horse riding
and comes from New Zealand.

220
00:16:08,098 --> 00:16:10,223
Daniel enjoys publishing
and comes...

221
00:16:10,298 --> 00:16:12,730
- All over your face?
- Exactly.

222
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:18,095
Excuse me. I'm terribly sorry to
interrupt you when you're having dinner.

223
00:16:18,165 --> 00:16:21,256
- It's just that...
- Yes. Yes, it was me.

224
00:16:21,332 --> 00:16:23,491
Yes. Nine years ago.

225
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,497
No current plans
to record anything else.

226
00:16:25,565 --> 00:16:28,326
- Thank you so much.
- It's just that...

227
00:16:28,398 --> 00:16:31,887
your chair is on my wife's coat.

228
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:36,488
- Your chair.
- Of course it is.

229
00:16:36,565 --> 00:16:38,929
- I'm so terribly sorry.
- Thank you.

230
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,762
Major dilemma.

231
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:44,855
If I actually do, by some terrible
chance, end up in flagrante...

232
00:16:44,932 --> 00:16:48,193
surely these would be
most attractive at crucial moment.

233
00:16:48,265 --> 00:16:51,493
However, chances of reaching
crucial moment greatly increase...

234
00:16:51,565 --> 00:16:54,656
by wearing these scary
stomach-holding-in pants...

235
00:16:54,732 --> 00:16:57,254
very popular with grannies
the world over.

236
00:16:58,632 --> 00:17:01,063
Tricky. Very tricky.

237
00:17:16,732 --> 00:17:19,562
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to...

238
00:17:19,632 --> 00:17:22,359
the launch of Kafka's Motorbike,
the greatest book of our time.

239
00:17:22,432 --> 00:17:24,295
And here to introduce it
is Mr. Titspervert.

240
00:17:26,065 --> 00:17:28,258
Fitzherbert, Fitzherbert.

241
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:33,224
Circulate,
oozing intelligence.

242
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:37,390
Ignore Daniel and be fabulous
with everyone else.

243
00:17:37,465 --> 00:17:42,056
I am the intellectual equal
of everyone else here.

244
00:17:42,131 --> 00:17:45,995
It's like a whole theory
of short fiction and of the novella.

245
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,031
And, of course, the problem with
Martin's definition of the novella...

246
00:17:49,098 --> 00:17:50,655
is that it really
only applies to him.

247
00:17:53,465 --> 00:17:56,727
That doesn't sound
like Martin. Not.

248
00:17:58,499 --> 00:18:00,158
I could be wrong.
What do you think?

249
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,654
Do you know...

250
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:09,258
where the toilets are?

251
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:13,723
Stay calm.
Can't get any worse.

252
00:18:17,265 --> 00:18:21,561
- What are you doing here?
- I've been asking myself that question.

253
00:18:22,732 --> 00:18:25,891
I came with a colleague.
So how are you?

254
00:18:25,965 --> 00:18:28,090
Well, apart from being
very disappointed...

255
00:18:28,165 --> 00:18:32,598
not to see my favorite
reindeer jumper again, I'm well.

256
00:18:32,665 --> 00:18:34,392
Anyone going to introduce me?

257
00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:37,987
Introduce people
with thoughtful details.

258
00:18:38,065 --> 00:18:41,259
Perpetua,
this is Mark Darcy.

259
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:45,230
Mark's a prematurely middle-aged prick
with a cruel-raced ex-wife.

260
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:48,594
Perpetua's a fat-ass old bag
who spends her time bossing me around.

261
00:18:50,398 --> 00:18:52,159
Maybe not.

262
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:54,130
Anyone going
to introduce me?

263
00:18:56,065 --> 00:18:58,031
This is Mark Darcy.

264
00:18:58,098 --> 00:19:02,360
Mark's a top barrister.
He comes from Grafton Underwood.

265
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,364
Perpetua is one
of my work colleagues.

266
00:19:04,432 --> 00:19:06,954
I know you by reputation,
of course.

267
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:10,730
Natasha.

268
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:13,264
This is BridgetJones.
Bridget, this is Natasha.

269
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:16,730
Natasha is a top attorney
and specializes in family law.

270
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:20,458
Bridget works in publishing and used
to play naked in my paddling pool.

271
00:19:21,931 --> 00:19:24,227
How odd.

272
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:27,855
- Perpetua, how's the house hunt going?
- Disaster.

273
00:19:27,931 --> 00:19:30,159
Can't even go
into it with you.

274
00:19:30,232 --> 00:19:33,925
By the by,
that man is gorgeous.

275
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:35,726
Yes, Mark.

276
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:39,231
Just give me time.
Give me time.

277
00:19:40,499 --> 00:19:43,862
You've written "a searing vision"...
Can you remember the rest of this?

278
00:19:43,931 --> 00:19:47,386
"Of the wounds our century has
inflicted on traditional masculinity.

279
00:19:47,465 --> 00:19:49,953
Positively Vonnegutesque."

280
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,757
Listen, you don't know
where the loos are here, do you?

281
00:19:53,831 --> 00:19:56,627
- Yes. They're that way.
- Thanks.

282
00:20:01,131 --> 00:20:02,994
One, two.

283
00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:07,389
Ladies and gentlemen.

284
00:20:12,398 --> 00:20:13,557
Ladies and...

285
00:20:20,098 --> 00:20:21,564
Sorry, the...

286
00:20:21,632 --> 00:20:24,961
mike's not working.

287
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,656
Ladies and gentlemen...

288
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:33,090
welcome to the launch
of Kafka's Motorbike...

289
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:36,154
the greatest book of our time.

290
00:20:41,931 --> 00:20:44,693
Obviously,
except for your books, Mr. Rushdie...

291
00:20:44,764 --> 00:20:48,094
which are also very good.

292
00:20:50,998 --> 00:20:53,055
And Lord Archer.

293
00:20:53,131 --> 00:20:56,393
Yours aren't bad either.

294
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,230
Anyway, what I mean is...

295
00:21:00,298 --> 00:21:02,389
welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

296
00:21:02,465 --> 00:21:05,090
Thank you for coming
to the launch...

297
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:09,325
of one of the top 30
books of our time.

298
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:12,421
Anyway. At least.

299
00:21:12,499 --> 00:21:17,329
And here
to introduce it properly...

300
00:21:17,398 --> 00:21:19,727
is the man we all call...

301
00:21:21,332 --> 00:21:24,560
- Titspervert.
- Mister...

302
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:36,288
Because that is his name.

303
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,491
Thank you.

304
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:48,224
Thank you, Brenda.

305
00:21:49,432 --> 00:21:51,591
Just switch this on.

306
00:21:56,098 --> 00:21:58,825
So how autobiographical
is your work, Salman?

307
00:21:58,898 --> 00:22:01,762
It's an amazing thing.
Nobody's ever asked me that question.

308
00:22:01,831 --> 00:22:03,660
Excuse me.

309
00:22:04,499 --> 00:22:08,760
Jones, sod 'em all.
It was a brilliant...

310
00:22:08,831 --> 00:22:12,923
postmodernist masterpiece
of oratorical fireworks, really.

311
00:22:15,232 --> 00:22:17,357
You're looking
very sexy, Jones.

312
00:22:17,432 --> 00:22:20,455
I'm going to have to take you to dinner
now whether you like it or not, okay?

313
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,654
Come on. Get your stuff.

314
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:34,226
How do you feel about this situation
in Chechnya? Isn't it a nightmare?

315
00:22:34,298 --> 00:22:36,423
I couldn't give a fuck, Jones.
Now look.

316
00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:39,589
How do you know Arsey Darcy?

317
00:22:39,664 --> 00:22:43,994
Apparently I used to
run 'round naked in his paddling pool.

318
00:22:44,065 --> 00:22:46,258
I bet you did, you dirty bitch.

319
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:50,063
- What about you?
- Same.

320
00:22:52,165 --> 00:22:54,596
I was best man at his wedding.

321
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:58,392
- He was a mate from Cambridge.
- Then what?

322
00:22:59,998 --> 00:23:03,192
Then nothing.

323
00:23:03,265 --> 00:23:05,856
You don't need to protect him.
He's no friend of mine.

324
00:23:05,931 --> 00:23:10,387
Well, then,
many years later...

325
00:23:10,465 --> 00:23:13,897
I made the somewhat
catastrophic mistake...

326
00:23:13,965 --> 00:23:18,091
of introducing him
to my fiancee.

327
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:23,389
And...

328
00:23:26,265 --> 00:23:29,992
I couldn't say in all honesty
I've ever quite forgiven him.

329
00:23:30,065 --> 00:23:31,429
God. So...

330
00:23:32,564 --> 00:23:37,259
he's a nasty bastard
as well as a dull bastard.

331
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:40,059
Yes. Yes,
I think that's fair.

332
00:23:40,131 --> 00:23:42,528
Anyway, fuck him. Listen,
don't let him ruin our evening.

333
00:23:42,598 --> 00:23:44,587
Why don't you
have some more wine...

334
00:23:44,664 --> 00:23:47,528
and tell me more about practicing
French kissing with girls at school?

335
00:23:47,598 --> 00:23:49,826
- That's a very good story.
- It wasn't French kissing.

336
00:23:49,898 --> 00:23:53,092
Don't care. Make it up.
That's an order, Jones.

337
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,896
So, how about a drink
at my place?

338
00:23:55,965 --> 00:24:00,261
Totally innocent,
no funny business, just full sex.

339
00:24:02,931 --> 00:24:05,056
I should get a taxi.

340
00:24:05,131 --> 00:24:08,325
But thank you
for the lovely dinner.

341
00:24:11,831 --> 00:24:13,626
It's a pleasure, Jones.

342
00:24:29,965 --> 00:24:33,556
You're alone all the time

343
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:37,491
Does it ever bother you

344
00:24:37,564 --> 00:24:39,587
Have you asked why

345
00:24:39,664 --> 00:24:43,494
You seem to fall in love

346
00:24:43,564 --> 00:24:45,655
And out again

347
00:24:45,731 --> 00:24:49,527
Do you really ever love

348
00:24:49,598 --> 00:24:51,155
Orjust pretend

349
00:24:51,232 --> 00:24:55,926
Baby, why fool yourself

350
00:24:55,998 --> 00:24:59,396
Don't be afraid
to help yourself

351
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:02,453
Now, these are very
silly little boots, Jones.

352
00:25:03,332 --> 00:25:06,025
And this is
a very silly little dress...

353
00:25:06,098 --> 00:25:10,428
and these are...

354
00:25:10,498 --> 00:25:13,158
fuck me...
absolutely enormous pants.

355
00:25:13,232 --> 00:25:16,925
- Jesus. Fuck.
- No. Don't apologize. I like them.

356
00:25:17,831 --> 00:25:19,626
Hello, Mummy!

357
00:25:23,232 --> 00:25:25,095
I have to have another look.
They're too good to be true.

358
00:25:25,165 --> 00:25:27,063
Nothing to be embarrassed about.

359
00:25:27,131 --> 00:25:29,756
I'm wearing something similar myself.
Here. I'll show you.

360
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:37,497
This time decide
that you will open up

361
00:25:37,564 --> 00:25:39,689
Let it in

362
00:25:39,764 --> 00:25:43,719
There's no shame in sharing love

363
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:46,593
You feel within

364
00:25:46,664 --> 00:25:49,324
So jump right in

365
00:25:49,397 --> 00:25:52,228
Head over heels

366
00:25:52,298 --> 00:25:54,161
And fall right in

367
00:25:56,165 --> 00:25:58,790
That was fantastic.

368
00:26:03,232 --> 00:26:05,754
What happens at the office?

369
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,657
I'm glad you asked that.
You see...

370
00:26:08,731 --> 00:26:12,720
it's a publishing house, so
that means people write things for us...

371
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:15,389
and then we print out all the pages
and fasten them together...

372
00:26:15,464 --> 00:26:17,555
and make them into
what we call a "book,"Jones.

373
00:26:18,731 --> 00:26:20,720
Do you think people will notice?

374
00:26:22,131 --> 00:26:24,653
- Notice what?
- Us.

375
00:26:24,731 --> 00:26:26,390
Working together,
sleeping together.

376
00:26:26,464 --> 00:26:28,487
Hang on a minute, Jones.

377
00:26:28,564 --> 00:26:32,621
Just slow down. It started
on Tuesday, and now it's Thursday.

378
00:26:33,498 --> 00:26:37,487
It's not exactly
a long-term relationship yet, is it?

379
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:42,829
You very bad man.

380
00:26:51,131 --> 00:26:53,426
BridgetJones,
wanton sex goddess...

381
00:26:53,498 --> 00:26:55,987
with a very bad man
between her thighs.

382
00:26:57,298 --> 00:26:59,422
Mum.

383
00:26:59,498 --> 00:27:01,589
It's a truth
universally acknowledged...

384
00:27:01,664 --> 00:27:05,426
that the moment one area
of your life starts going okay...

385
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:09,863
another part of it
falls spectacularly to pieces.

386
00:27:09,931 --> 00:27:13,419
Anyone else want to have it oeuf?
Don't be shy, madam.

387
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:14,930
French.

388
00:27:14,998 --> 00:27:20,396
Have it oeuf
with the WiseCrack Egg Peeler.

389
00:27:20,464 --> 00:27:23,260
Now, nice, firm grip.

390
00:27:24,664 --> 00:27:27,425
Put it in the hole.

391
00:27:27,498 --> 00:27:31,954
Up, down, up, down,
and off it comes in your hand.

392
00:27:33,931 --> 00:27:36,795
Mind the overspray.
Sorry.

393
00:27:39,998 --> 00:27:43,055
Darling, if I came in with my knickers
on my head, he wouldn't notice.

394
00:27:43,131 --> 00:27:45,063
I've spent 35 years
cleaning his house...

395
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:47,653
washing his clothes,
bringing up his children.

396
00:27:47,731 --> 00:27:49,890
I'm your child too.

397
00:27:49,965 --> 00:27:53,362
To be honest, darling, having children
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

398
00:27:53,431 --> 00:27:55,659
Given my chance again,
I'm not sure I'd have any.

399
00:27:56,464 --> 00:28:00,556
Now it's the winter of my life, and I
haven't actually got anything of my own.

400
00:28:00,631 --> 00:28:03,756
I've got no power,
no real career...

401
00:28:03,831 --> 00:28:06,388
no sex life.

402
00:28:06,464 --> 00:28:10,260
Got no life at all. I'm like
the grasshopper who sang all summer.

403
00:28:10,331 --> 00:28:13,559
- Like Germaine sodding Geer.
- Greer.

404
00:28:13,631 --> 00:28:15,097
Well, anyway,
I'm not having it.

405
00:28:15,165 --> 00:28:17,392
And I've been talent-spotted.

406
00:28:17,464 --> 00:28:20,192
Julian thinks
I've got great potential.

407
00:28:20,264 --> 00:28:23,231
- Who's Julian?
- From the Home Shopping Channel.

408
00:28:23,297 --> 00:28:25,320
Comes into the store
to have his colors done.

409
00:28:25,397 --> 00:28:27,023
Potential for what?

410
00:28:27,098 --> 00:28:31,224
As a demonstrator on his cable show...
you know, his assistant.

411
00:28:31,297 --> 00:28:33,593
Apparently, it's the highest-rated show
on the channel.

412
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:37,097
Apart from the one with the fat people
who beat up their relatives.

413
00:28:37,165 --> 00:28:40,222
I must whiz.
Have you heard from Mark Darcy?

414
00:28:40,297 --> 00:28:41,957
Good-bye, Mum.

415
00:29:03,731 --> 00:29:07,993
And a few weeks later,
it got lots worse.

416
00:29:08,065 --> 00:29:11,190
- Hello!
- Look at this.

417
00:29:11,264 --> 00:29:13,423
...hanging off
this heart-shaped pendant.

418
00:29:13,498 --> 00:29:16,692
One of my own
personal recommendations...

419
00:29:16,764 --> 00:29:21,822
is this absolutely stunning
matching necklace and earring set.

420
00:29:21,898 --> 00:29:27,728
The earrings,
measuring just over a centimeter...

421
00:29:27,798 --> 00:29:31,696
in genuine diamante
with topaz and lapis lazuli...

422
00:29:31,764 --> 00:29:34,730
in a lovely mock-gold finish.

423
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:39,060
The exact replica of those worn
at Wimbledon in 1993...

424
00:29:39,131 --> 00:29:41,892
by Her Royal Highness,
the Duchess of Kent.

425
00:29:46,331 --> 00:29:48,559
Has she actually moved out, then?

426
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:53,590
Apparently she and this tangerine-tinted
buffoon are suddenly an item.

427
00:29:53,664 --> 00:29:56,687
Half our friends have had them
'round to bloody dinner.

428
00:29:56,764 --> 00:30:00,890
She's even taking jaundiced Julian to
Una Alconbury's tarts and vicars party.

429
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,760
That's not the Pamela I knew.
That's cruel.

430
00:30:03,831 --> 00:30:05,763
Still...

431
00:30:05,831 --> 00:30:08,388
could be a golden opportunity.

432
00:30:08,464 --> 00:30:11,225
If you spent the entire party...

433
00:30:11,297 --> 00:30:14,593
flirting with other women,
it would drive Mum wild with jealousy.

434
00:30:14,664 --> 00:30:17,755
- Will it?
- That's how I got my man.

435
00:30:17,831 --> 00:30:20,922
Have you got a boyfriend?
A real one?

436
00:30:20,998 --> 00:30:24,486
I have, Father. I have.

437
00:30:24,564 --> 00:30:27,462
And he's perfect.

438
00:30:46,498 --> 00:30:50,260
Hurrah.
Am no longer tragic spinster...

439
00:30:50,331 --> 00:30:53,593
but proper girlfriend
of bona fide sex god...

440
00:30:53,664 --> 00:30:55,755
so committed
that he's taking me...

441
00:30:55,831 --> 00:30:58,490
on a full-blown,
minibreak holiday weekend.

442
00:30:59,664 --> 00:31:01,653
Promise me we don't have
to sit in little boats...

443
00:31:01,731 --> 00:31:03,663
and read poncey poetry
to each other.

444
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:05,822
He's also agreed to protect me...

445
00:31:05,898 --> 00:31:08,557
at Uncle Geoffrey's
hideous tarts and vicars party.

446
00:31:08,631 --> 00:31:12,654
This can't be just shagging.
A minibreak means true love.

447
00:31:14,464 --> 00:31:18,328
Suddenly feel like screen goddess
in manner of Grace Kelly.

448
00:31:21,664 --> 00:31:25,721
Though, perhaps, ever so slightly
less elegant under pressure.

449
00:31:29,898 --> 00:31:33,421
Very quiet here, isn't it?
Are we the only guests?

450
00:31:33,498 --> 00:31:35,327
We have a wedding this weekend.

451
00:31:35,397 --> 00:31:38,056
I believe there are
just four of you not involved.

452
00:31:40,297 --> 00:31:42,729
You do the boats.
I'll do the tea.

453
00:31:44,297 --> 00:31:46,559
- Oh, Jesus.
- Hello there.

454
00:31:48,764 --> 00:31:50,525
Well, well.

455
00:31:50,598 --> 00:31:53,393
Take it you're also heading
for Alconburys' rockery.

456
00:31:53,464 --> 00:31:57,760
- Yes, that's right.
- I brought Natasha.

457
00:31:57,831 --> 00:32:01,388
Get a bit of work done. Thought I might
make it a not entirely wasted weekend.

458
00:32:01,464 --> 00:32:04,760
How interesting.
What a gripping life you do lead.

459
00:32:04,831 --> 00:32:07,820
I'll see you upstairs in a second.

460
00:32:22,397 --> 00:32:24,420
The weakness of their case...

461
00:32:24,498 --> 00:32:26,828
lies in the deposition
they made on August 30.

462
00:32:26,898 --> 00:32:28,591
"Season of mist...

463
00:32:28,664 --> 00:32:32,323
and mellow fruitlessness."

464
00:32:32,397 --> 00:32:35,591
Oh, fuck me, I love Keats.
Have you heard this one?

465
00:32:35,664 --> 00:32:37,823
There was a young woman
from Ealing...

466
00:32:37,898 --> 00:32:40,489
who had a peculiar feeling.

467
00:32:40,564 --> 00:32:43,553
She lay on her back
and opened her crack...

468
00:32:43,631 --> 00:32:46,426
and pissed
all over the ceiling.

469
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:48,487
Bollocks. Shit.

470
00:32:48,564 --> 00:32:52,052
- I'm boarding you. No alternative.
- Don't you dare!

471
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,221
- I'm king of the world!
- No!

472
00:32:54,297 --> 00:32:55,490
Fuck me!

473
00:33:00,997 --> 00:33:04,486
- Piss and bollocks. That's it.
- You stupid ass!

474
00:33:06,997 --> 00:33:08,896
Bollocks.

475
00:33:12,331 --> 00:33:14,422
So childish.

476
00:33:16,064 --> 00:33:19,690
- Yes.
- Darce, come on in!

477
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,662
Water's lovely.

478
00:33:21,731 --> 00:33:24,458
You're working too hard, mate.

479
00:33:27,664 --> 00:33:28,652
Yes?

480
00:33:28,731 --> 00:33:31,822
That thing you just did is
actually illegal in several countries.

481
00:33:31,898 --> 00:33:35,887
That is the major reason I'm so thrilled
to be living in Britain today.

482
00:33:36,731 --> 00:33:39,094
I can't understand
why the prime minister...

483
00:33:39,164 --> 00:33:41,596
doesn't mention it more
in his speeches.

484
00:33:41,664 --> 00:33:44,824
- You should write to him about it.
- I intend to.

485
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:54,625
- Do you love me?
- Shut up, or I'll do it again.

486
00:33:56,798 --> 00:33:59,922
- Do you love me?
- Right. You asked for it.

487
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:03,263
And over you go.

488
00:34:03,331 --> 00:34:05,194
I'm going to give you
something to bite on.

489
00:34:05,264 --> 00:34:08,594
Here. Okay?
Pop this in your mouth, darling.

490
00:34:11,264 --> 00:34:13,492
You're begging for it.

491
00:34:13,564 --> 00:34:15,325
Stop it!

492
00:34:29,464 --> 00:34:34,055
I've got to go back to town.
A meeting's come up.

493
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:37,028
- On a Sunday?
- The meeting's first thing tomorrow.

494
00:34:37,097 --> 00:34:39,029
I've got to work
on some figures.

495
00:34:39,097 --> 00:34:42,586
We could just
pop into the party...

496
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:46,255
- for a minute and leave early.
- I'm sorry. I just can't do it.

497
00:34:47,164 --> 00:34:49,153
I've got to head back.

498
00:34:49,231 --> 00:34:53,993
Listen, if you've changed your mind,
you could just say so.

499
00:34:54,064 --> 00:34:56,530
Because, honestly, I don't see
what could be so important.

500
00:34:56,598 --> 00:34:58,826
No, well,
you wouldn't, would you?

501
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:03,920
'Cause you don't have the faintest idea
of how much trouble the company's in.

502
00:35:03,997 --> 00:35:07,259
You swan in in your short skirt
and your sexy see-through blouse...

503
00:35:07,331 --> 00:35:09,263
and fanny around
with press releases.

504
00:35:09,331 --> 00:35:12,058
This is the Americans flying in 'cause
they're thinking of shutting us down...

505
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,653
for fuck's sake!

506
00:35:17,397 --> 00:35:18,624
Sorry.

507
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,096
I'm sorry.
I'm being a prat.

508
00:35:30,664 --> 00:35:33,061
I'm going to arrange a lovely car
to come and pick you up...

509
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,323
and take you back to London
after the party, okay?

510
00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:37,420
If you have to travel alone,
travel in style.

511
00:35:39,564 --> 00:35:43,553
And I also think
it's very important...

512
00:35:43,631 --> 00:35:46,756
that you win
this costume competition.

513
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:50,794
Good. Good start.

514
00:35:53,097 --> 00:35:55,757
Now, then, Miss Jones,
where does this go?

515
00:35:58,897 --> 00:36:01,920
Oh, well, here we go.

516
00:36:01,997 --> 00:36:06,760
Trying hard to fight off a vision
of Mum and Auntie Una in fishnet tights.

517
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:09,661
Seems unnatural,
wrong even, for 60-year-olds...

518
00:36:09,731 --> 00:36:13,128
to dress up as prostitutes and priests
on a Sunday afternoon.

519
00:36:18,464 --> 00:36:20,396
Oh, holyJesus.

520
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:27,325
- Where are the other tarts and vicars?
- Didn't Geoffrey call you?

521
00:36:27,397 --> 00:36:31,124
- Didn't you telephone Colin and Bridget?
- How's my little Bridget?

522
00:36:35,097 --> 00:36:37,086
Where's this chap of yours?

523
00:36:37,164 --> 00:36:40,722
- He had to work, so...
- Likely tale.

524
00:36:40,797 --> 00:36:42,627
Off they run.

525
00:36:46,264 --> 00:36:49,492
Bizarre what some men
find attractive.

526
00:36:50,598 --> 00:36:52,790
- Oh, God.
- Darling.

527
00:36:54,064 --> 00:36:57,724
What on earth are you wearing?
You look like a common prostitute.

528
00:36:57,797 --> 00:37:00,888
- Yes, that was actually the point.
- Say hi toJulian.

529
00:37:00,964 --> 00:37:02,987
Hello, Julian.

530
00:37:03,064 --> 00:37:06,326
My dear, you and your mother
could be sisters.

531
00:37:07,997 --> 00:37:09,826
And what a lovely bracelet.

532
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:11,488
It's what I call an "all-rounder."

533
00:37:11,564 --> 00:37:14,553
Sort of thing one can wear
with anything to any occasion.

534
00:37:16,164 --> 00:37:18,096
Have you spoken to my dad?

535
00:37:18,164 --> 00:37:20,857
Yes. He's behaving most bizarrely.

536
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:24,862
I think he was trying to flirt with
Penny Husbands-Bosworth, poor thing.

537
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:28,055
She was very frightened.
She's only just had her ovaries done.

538
00:37:33,498 --> 00:37:36,759
- I don't know what you ever saw in him.
- Shh. Bad man.

539
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,119
Didn't tell you either?

540
00:37:51,164 --> 00:37:53,392
I didn't spend as much
as Bernard, thank God.

541
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:04,163
- I'm sorry, Dad.
- The way she looked at me.

542
00:38:05,264 --> 00:38:07,230
She loves you, really.

543
00:38:07,297 --> 00:38:10,888
You love each other.
This is only a temporary glitch.

544
00:38:10,964 --> 00:38:13,828
Is it? I don't know.

545
00:38:14,997 --> 00:38:16,986
I don't know.

546
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:23,593
There you are. Don't worry.
You're not the only one.

547
00:38:23,663 --> 00:38:26,323
This is Penny. Geoffrey didn't
get in touch with her either.

548
00:38:26,397 --> 00:38:29,158
- I'm sorry?
- Geoffrey didn't contact you either...

549
00:38:29,231 --> 00:38:31,992
to tell you the tarts and vicars concept
had gone out the window.

550
00:38:32,064 --> 00:38:35,360
- Yes, he did.
- Oh, right.

551
00:38:35,431 --> 00:38:38,488
Lovely dress. Very exotic.

552
00:38:42,397 --> 00:38:45,557
Shame you couldn't bring your boyfriend.
What's his name? David? Darren?

553
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,529
Daniel Cleaver.

554
00:38:47,598 --> 00:38:50,223
- Is he a friend of yours, Mark?
- Absolutely not.

555
00:38:50,297 --> 00:38:52,694
I hope he's good enough
for our little Bridget.

556
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:55,752
I think I can say
with total confidence, absolutely not.

557
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:59,388
I'm sure he'd say the same about you,
given your past behavior.

558
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:02,589
- Sorry?
- I think you know what I mean.

559
00:39:18,331 --> 00:39:21,422
Looks like Auntie Shirley
didn't get the message either.

560
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:36,163
I just really, really wanted
to see a friendly face.

561
00:39:36,231 --> 00:39:39,095
Now, listen. I tell you what.
I have an idea.

562
00:39:39,164 --> 00:39:42,596
Let me finish this while you go home
and have a long hot bath...

563
00:39:42,663 --> 00:39:45,720
and I'll call 'round,
and we'll have dinner later, okay?

564
00:39:49,064 --> 00:39:53,019
- Is there someone here?
- Not that I'm aware of.

565
00:39:53,097 --> 00:39:56,222
Unless that Bosnian family's
moved in again. Bastards.

566
00:40:10,397 --> 00:40:13,124
I'm sorry. Sorry.

567
00:40:16,064 --> 00:40:17,529
I'm going mad.

568
00:40:17,597 --> 00:40:19,756
Listen,
I am feeling really bad, actually.

569
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:21,421
- I should have been there.
- No, I'm sorry.

570
00:40:21,498 --> 00:40:25,055
No, I'm sorry.
At least I got a lot of work done.

571
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:27,062
Just give me
one more hour, okay?

572
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:31,256
Fine. That's fine.
I'll go home and de-bunny.

573
00:40:34,164 --> 00:40:38,494
And you know last night
when I said I loved you?

574
00:40:39,498 --> 00:40:42,362
I didn't mean it.
I was being ironic.

575
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:44,919
Good. I know.

576
00:40:50,297 --> 00:40:52,286
Thank you, madam.

577
00:41:24,164 --> 00:41:26,755
This is Lara
from the New York office.

578
00:41:28,164 --> 00:41:30,357
Lara, this is Bridget.

579
00:41:30,431 --> 00:41:32,124
Hey there.

580
00:41:35,064 --> 00:41:37,394
I thought you said
she was thin.

581
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:30,823
I was hoping that you would
want to be a part of it.

582
00:42:30,897 --> 00:42:34,886
Listen, this is totally insane.

583
00:42:34,964 --> 00:42:39,124
I'm 36. It may be my last chance
to have a child.

584
00:42:56,463 --> 00:42:59,896
The male penetrates the female
and leaves.

585
00:42:59,964 --> 00:43:03,021
Coitus is brief and perfunctory.

586
00:43:03,097 --> 00:43:07,791
For the female, all there is
to do now is wait and wait.

587
00:43:33,231 --> 00:43:35,492
We've had
a very good response...

588
00:43:35,563 --> 00:43:37,756
to the Teddy Knows Best
teaser campaign...

589
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:41,887
and had various local radio bids
for author interviews, which is good...

590
00:43:41,964 --> 00:43:45,260
Stop that.
I feel terrible.

591
00:43:46,064 --> 00:43:49,325
The thing is
with Lara and me...

592
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:53,221
- Well, you know.
- No, you'll have to fill me in.

593
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:57,592
The truth is we're the same,
Bridge, you and me.

594
00:43:57,663 --> 00:44:00,857
We're two people of a certain age
looking for the moment to commit...

595
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,260
and finding it really hard.

596
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:05,229
And I just think that in the end...

597
00:44:05,297 --> 00:44:10,558
it's got to be something extraordinary
which makes us go that extra mile...

598
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:17,529
and I think Lara being American or
something to do with confidence...

599
00:44:17,597 --> 00:44:19,586
and being so...

600
00:44:21,396 --> 00:44:23,760
well, young, you know.

601
00:44:28,964 --> 00:44:32,396
We've become very close.

602
00:44:32,463 --> 00:44:35,918
You've only just met her.
She flew in yesterday.

603
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,162
Silly Bridget.

604
00:44:44,231 --> 00:44:47,856
- You haven't only just met her.
- No.

605
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:52,294
No, I got to know her pretty well when
we were in the New York office together.

606
00:44:55,263 --> 00:44:57,162
Oh, fuck.

607
00:44:57,997 --> 00:45:00,088
There's no easy way
to say this, but...

608
00:45:01,663 --> 00:45:04,629
I wanted you
to be the first to know that...

609
00:45:06,997 --> 00:45:08,986
we're engaged.

610
00:45:28,663 --> 00:45:33,686
At times like this, continuing
with one's life seems impossible...

611
00:45:33,763 --> 00:45:38,855
and eating the entire contents
of one's fridge seems inevitable.

612
00:45:38,858 --> 00:45:40,619
I have two choices:

613
00:45:40,691 --> 00:45:44,316
To give up and accept
permanent state of spinsterhood...

614
00:45:44,391 --> 00:45:47,221
and eventual eating
by Alsatians...

615
00:45:48,358 --> 00:45:51,882
or not, and this time
I choose not.

616
00:45:52,825 --> 00:45:57,587
I will not be defeated by a bad man
and an American stick insect.

617
00:45:57,658 --> 00:46:00,647
Instead, I choose vodka.

618
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:04,048
And Chaka Khan.

619
00:47:00,992 --> 00:47:02,355
Why do you want to be
in television?

620
00:47:02,425 --> 00:47:06,152
Well, I've realized that I've
become deeply committed...

621
00:47:06,224 --> 00:47:10,520
to communicating to the public the
up-to-the-moment and in-depth news...

622
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,614
both political and ecological.

623
00:47:12,691 --> 00:47:16,123
What do you think
of the El Nino phenomenon?

624
00:47:16,191 --> 00:47:17,919
It's a blip.

625
00:47:17,992 --> 00:47:20,924
I think, basically,
Latin music is on its way out.

626
00:47:22,411 --> 00:47:23,843
Why television?

627
00:47:23,912 --> 00:47:27,844
Because I'm passionately committed
to communicating with children.

628
00:47:27,912 --> 00:47:31,276
- They are the future.
- Do you have any children of your own?

629
00:47:31,345 --> 00:47:33,504
Christ, no.

630
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:37,942
Sorry.

631
00:47:38,012 --> 00:47:39,807
So, why do you want to work
in television?

632
00:47:39,878 --> 00:47:43,469
I've got to leave my current job
because I've shagged my boss.

633
00:47:43,545 --> 00:47:46,807
Fair enough. Start Monday.
We'll see how we go.

634
00:47:46,878 --> 00:47:49,969
And, incidentally...

635
00:47:50,045 --> 00:47:54,340
at Sit Up, Britain, no one ever
gets sacked for shaggin' the boss.

636
00:47:54,411 --> 00:47:56,241
That's a matter of principle.

637
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:04,011
Bridge, come on.

638
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,273
I know it's been awkward as ass,
but there's no need to leave.

639
00:48:07,345 --> 00:48:12,108
No, actually, there is.
I've been offered a job in television.

640
00:48:12,179 --> 00:48:13,644
Television?

641
00:48:14,745 --> 00:48:16,836
And they want me
to start straight away.

642
00:48:16,912 --> 00:48:20,810
So I've got to leave
in about three minutes.

643
00:48:25,378 --> 00:48:27,936
Just hold it right there,
Miss Jones.

644
00:48:28,012 --> 00:48:31,172
I'm sorry to inform you, but I think
you'll find that, by contract...

645
00:48:31,246 --> 00:48:33,803
you are expected to
give at least six weeks' notice.

646
00:48:33,878 --> 00:48:37,242
Yes. Well, I thought with the company
being in so much trouble and all...

647
00:48:37,311 --> 00:48:41,005
you wouldn't miss the person
who "waltzes in in a see-through top...

648
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:43,476
and fannies about
with the press releases."

649
00:48:46,545 --> 00:48:49,272
I want to hear this.
Because if she gives one inch...

650
00:48:49,345 --> 00:48:53,176
I'm gonna fire her bony little bottom
anyway for being totally spineless.

651
00:48:54,311 --> 00:48:58,403
- What?
- I just think you should know that...

652
00:48:58,478 --> 00:49:01,273
there are lots of prospects here
for a talented p...

653
00:49:01,345 --> 00:49:02,504
Just give me a minute,
would you, Simon? Thanks.

654
00:49:02,578 --> 00:49:04,044
Righto, boss man.

655
00:49:05,311 --> 00:49:08,402
Lots of prospects
for a person who...

656
00:49:09,645 --> 00:49:15,441
perhaps for personal reasons has been
slightly overlooked professionally.

657
00:49:15,511 --> 00:49:18,500
Thank you, Daniel.
That is very good to know.

658
00:49:18,578 --> 00:49:22,136
But if staying here means
working within ten yards of you...

659
00:49:22,211 --> 00:49:26,234
frankly, I'd rather have a job
wiping Saddam Hussein's ass.

660
00:49:26,311 --> 00:49:29,937
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Find out what it means to me

661
00:49:30,012 --> 00:49:33,409
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Take care of T-C-B

662
00:49:33,478 --> 00:49:35,467
Sock it to me, sock it to me
sock it to me

663
00:49:36,979 --> 00:49:39,911
- Well, bye, everyone.
- Just a little bit

664
00:49:39,979 --> 00:49:42,070
A little respect

665
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,804
All the time

666
00:49:43,878 --> 00:49:45,605
Keep on trying

667
00:49:45,678 --> 00:49:47,234
You're running out, fool

668
00:49:48,378 --> 00:49:49,810
Just sod off.

669
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:53,403
Hello and welcome to Sit Up, Britain,
a current affairs show...

670
00:49:53,478 --> 00:49:57,433
Okay, everybody, it is bonfire night,
and we are on fire.

671
00:49:57,511 --> 00:50:00,739
We have live fire station feeds
from Newcastle...

672
00:50:00,812 --> 00:50:03,801
Swansea, Sheffield
and Lewisham...

673
00:50:03,878 --> 00:50:05,673
just poised for tragedy.

674
00:50:05,745 --> 00:50:07,870
BridgetJones, where are you?

675
00:50:09,878 --> 00:50:12,140
- I'm here, Richard.
- Put on some more makeup.

676
00:50:12,211 --> 00:50:16,234
I want you on camera.
I'm thinking miniskirt.

677
00:50:16,311 --> 00:50:19,835
I'm thinking fireman's helmet.
I want you pointing a hose.

678
00:50:19,912 --> 00:50:22,742
I want you sliding down the pole.
Then go straight to the interview.

679
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:25,710
Great. I'll do it.

680
00:50:29,144 --> 00:50:31,167
No problem. Fine. Right.

681
00:50:31,245 --> 00:50:33,905
So you drop into shot and then
interview Chief Fireman Bevan.

682
00:50:33,979 --> 00:50:36,467
Yep. Go, go.

683
00:50:36,545 --> 00:50:39,011
- Go?
- Oh, no.

684
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:41,237
We're going to firefighters
in Newcastle first.

685
00:50:41,311 --> 00:50:43,573
Stop! Climb back up.

686
00:50:43,645 --> 00:50:45,406
Climb back up.
On you in 30 seconds.

687
00:50:50,345 --> 00:50:52,005
What is going on?

688
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,340
She's supposed to be
sliding down the pole, not climbing it.

689
00:50:54,411 --> 00:50:56,969
- Go, go. Go!
- Okay!

690
00:50:58,745 --> 00:51:00,210
Oh, Jesus Christ!

691
00:51:02,812 --> 00:51:05,300
We're out of time.
Just wind her up.

692
00:51:05,378 --> 00:51:10,936
Well, that seems to be about all we've
got time for down here in Lewisham.

693
00:51:11,012 --> 00:51:14,171
Chief Officer Bevan,
thank you very much.

694
00:51:14,245 --> 00:51:16,075
Excellent fire station.

695
00:51:16,878 --> 00:51:20,401
And now
back to the studio.

696
00:51:26,812 --> 00:51:29,972
Excellent.
Am national laughingstock.

697
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:32,169
Have bottom the size of Brazil...

698
00:51:32,245 --> 00:51:35,837
am daughter of broken home,
am rubbish at everything and...

699
00:51:35,912 --> 00:51:39,605
Oh, God. Am having dinner
with Magda andJeremy.

700
00:51:39,678 --> 00:51:42,405
The only thing worse
than smug, married couple...

701
00:51:42,478 --> 00:51:45,410
Lots of smug, married couples.

702
00:51:45,745 --> 00:51:48,142
Right.
Everyone, this is Bridget.

703
00:51:49,245 --> 00:51:50,973
Bridge,
this is Hugo and Jane.

704
00:51:51,045 --> 00:51:53,875
You know Cosmo and Woney.

705
00:51:55,311 --> 00:51:57,800
- This is Alistair and Henrietta.
- Hello.

706
00:51:57,878 --> 00:52:00,639
- Julia and Michael. Joanne and Paul.
- Hello.

707
00:52:00,712 --> 00:52:05,110
And Jeremy's partners from chambers,
Natasha Glenville and Mark Darcy.

708
00:52:05,178 --> 00:52:07,610
- Hi there.
- Hello.

709
00:52:07,678 --> 00:52:10,838
- Not in your bunny girl outfit today?
- No.

710
00:52:10,912 --> 00:52:15,571
We bunnies only wear our tails
on very special occasions.

711
00:52:15,645 --> 00:52:17,838
- Right, B. Sit yourself down.
- Right.

712
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:24,034
Hey, Bridge,
how's your love life?

713
00:52:25,345 --> 00:52:27,903
Still going out
with that publishing chappie?

714
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:30,308
No, actually.

715
00:52:31,645 --> 00:52:34,509
Never dip your nib in the office ink.

716
00:52:34,578 --> 00:52:35,669
Right.

717
00:52:35,745 --> 00:52:39,802
You really ought to hurry up
and get sprogged up, old girl.

718
00:52:39,878 --> 00:52:43,401
Time's a-running out.
Tick-tock.

719
00:52:44,245 --> 00:52:46,006
Yes, yes.

720
00:52:46,078 --> 00:52:49,841
Tell me, is it one in four marriages
that ends in divorce now or one in three?

721
00:52:49,912 --> 00:52:51,207
One in three.

722
00:52:52,411 --> 00:52:57,173
Seriously, the office is full
of single girls in their 30s.

723
00:52:57,245 --> 00:53:01,200
Fine physical specimens, but they just
can't seem to hold down a chap.

724
00:53:02,578 --> 00:53:06,533
Yes, why is it there are so many
unmarried women in their 30s these days?

725
00:53:13,078 --> 00:53:15,476
I don't know.

726
00:53:15,545 --> 00:53:18,443
I suppose it doesn't help that,
underneath our clothes...

727
00:53:18,511 --> 00:53:20,841
our entire bodies
are covered in scales.

728
00:53:33,912 --> 00:53:37,366
I very much enjoyed
your Lewisham fire report, by the way.

729
00:53:39,078 --> 00:53:41,044
Thank you.

730
00:53:49,478 --> 00:53:53,171
So, it didn't work out
with Daniel Cleaver?

731
00:53:54,078 --> 00:53:55,374
No, it didn't.

732
00:53:57,245 --> 00:53:59,677
I'm delighted to hear it.

733
00:53:59,745 --> 00:54:02,802
Look, are you and Cosmo
in this together?

734
00:54:02,878 --> 00:54:05,435
You seem to go out of your way
to try to make me feel...

735
00:54:05,511 --> 00:54:08,136
like a complete idiot
every time I see you...

736
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:11,644
and you really needn't bother.

737
00:54:11,712 --> 00:54:16,076
I already feel like an idiot
most of the time anyway...

738
00:54:16,144 --> 00:54:18,872
with or without a fireman's pole.

739
00:54:21,545 --> 00:54:25,477
That'll be my taxi.
Good night.

740
00:54:25,545 --> 00:54:28,841
Look, I'm sorry if I've been...

741
00:54:29,845 --> 00:54:31,174
What?

742
00:54:31,245 --> 00:54:33,404
I don't think
you're an idiot at all.

743
00:54:35,078 --> 00:54:39,101
I mean, there are elements
of the ridiculous about you.

744
00:54:39,178 --> 00:54:41,440
Your mother's
pretty interesting.

745
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:44,739
And you really
are an appallingly bad public speaker.

746
00:54:44,812 --> 00:54:47,107
And you tend to let
whatever is in your head...

747
00:54:47,178 --> 00:54:50,576
come out of your mouth without
much consideration of the consequences.

748
00:54:51,645 --> 00:54:55,008
I realize that when I met you
at the turkey curry buffet...

749
00:54:55,078 --> 00:54:59,942
that I was unforgivably rude and
wearing a reindeer jumper...

750
00:55:00,011 --> 00:55:02,307
that my mother
had given me the day before.

751
00:55:03,545 --> 00:55:05,670
But the thing is...

752
00:55:05,745 --> 00:55:09,837
What I'm trying to say,
very inarticulately...

753
00:55:09,911 --> 00:55:12,343
is that...

754
00:55:13,578 --> 00:55:17,567
in fact, perhaps,
despite appearances...

755
00:55:18,545 --> 00:55:21,170
I like you very much.

756
00:55:22,044 --> 00:55:24,408
Apart from the smoking
and the drinking...

757
00:55:24,478 --> 00:55:27,342
and the vulgar mother
and the verbal diarrhea.

758
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:31,241
No, I like you very much,
just as you are.

759
00:55:32,978 --> 00:55:36,672
Mark, we really are
making progress on the case in here.

760
00:55:36,745 --> 00:55:40,643
Jeremy's had a most brilliant idea.

761
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,371
Right.

762
00:55:46,645 --> 00:55:48,974
I must go because...

763
00:55:50,345 --> 00:55:53,902
Well, bye.

764
00:56:06,044 --> 00:56:10,602
"Just as you are"?
Not thinner? Not cleverer?

765
00:56:10,678 --> 00:56:13,701
Not with slightly bigger breasts
and a slightly smaller nose?

766
00:56:19,844 --> 00:56:22,743
Well, fuck me.

767
00:56:27,144 --> 00:56:29,303
But this is someone you hate, right?

768
00:56:31,078 --> 00:56:33,374
Yes, yes. I hate him.

769
00:56:39,745 --> 00:56:44,109
November 9. Weight: 138 pounds.

770
00:56:44,178 --> 00:56:48,668
Cigarettes:3. Birthday:33.

771
00:56:50,378 --> 00:56:51,934
See if you can
get it right this time.

772
00:56:52,011 --> 00:56:54,500
The verdict in the Aghani-Heaney case
is expected today.

773
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:58,567
Get yourself down to the high court.
I want a hardheaded interview.

774
00:56:59,877 --> 00:57:04,572
- You do know the Aghani-Heaney case?
- Yes, of course.

775
00:57:04,645 --> 00:57:06,769
Big case...

776
00:57:06,844 --> 00:57:10,140
featuring someone
called "Aghani-Heaney."

777
00:57:10,211 --> 00:57:14,007
Or two people called
Kafir Aghani and Eleanor Heaney?

778
00:57:14,078 --> 00:57:15,873
That's the one.

779
00:57:16,877 --> 00:57:19,968
She's a British aid worker.
He's a Kurdish freedom fighter.

780
00:57:20,044 --> 00:57:23,602
The government want to extradite him
home where he'll certainly be executed.

781
00:57:23,678 --> 00:57:26,768
She's married to him, and they've
fought for five years to keep him here.

782
00:57:26,844 --> 00:57:29,709
- Today is the decision.
- That's exciting.

783
00:57:30,345 --> 00:57:33,573
Yes, it is.
So what are you waiting for?

784
00:57:34,645 --> 00:57:36,735
Am suddenly
hardheaded journalist...

785
00:57:36,811 --> 00:57:39,936
ruthlessly committed
to promoting justice and liberty.

786
00:57:40,011 --> 00:57:44,171
Nothing can distract me from
my dedication to the pursuit of truth.

787
00:57:44,245 --> 00:57:46,767
Well, almost nothing.

788
00:57:46,844 --> 00:57:49,867
Right. I'll just pop
to the shop quickly for some ciggies.

789
00:57:50,877 --> 00:57:54,002
14Pfor the Polos and
the packet of Wheat Crunchies.

790
00:57:54,078 --> 00:57:57,135
- A packet of Embassy, please.
- I'm sorry. I'm not quite fi...

791
00:57:58,144 --> 00:58:00,133
Good afternoon.

792
00:58:03,545 --> 00:58:05,511
You like me
just the way I am.

793
00:58:05,578 --> 00:58:09,169
- Sorry?
- Nothing.

794
00:58:09,245 --> 00:58:11,438
Bridget,
we fucked up utterly.

795
00:58:11,511 --> 00:58:14,136
Eleanor Heaney and Kafir Aghani
have come and gone.

796
00:58:14,211 --> 00:58:16,643
Oh, God. I'll be sacked.

797
00:58:16,711 --> 00:58:18,802
Did the others get interviews?

798
00:58:18,877 --> 00:58:20,809
I don't know.
I was having a slash.

799
00:58:20,877 --> 00:58:23,809
- Actually, nobody got interviews.
- So how do you know?

800
00:58:23,877 --> 00:58:27,207
Because I was defending him.
I told him not to give interviews.

801
00:58:29,044 --> 00:58:30,169
Look.

802
00:58:30,245 --> 00:58:32,507
I have a plan.

803
00:58:32,777 --> 00:58:34,073
And action.

804
00:58:36,044 --> 00:58:41,500
Mr. Darcy, you were defending Mr. Aghani.
You must be delighted.

805
00:58:41,578 --> 00:58:44,169
Yes, well, Kafir Aghani
has spent his entire life...

806
00:58:44,245 --> 00:58:46,473
defending the basic human rights
of his own people...

807
00:58:46,545 --> 00:58:49,170
and today's verdict has been the result
of five years of struggle...

808
00:58:49,245 --> 00:58:53,234
by this woman, Eleanor Heaney,
to save the man she loves...

809
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:57,175
from an extradition order
tantamount to a death sentence.

810
00:58:58,345 --> 00:58:59,810
Right.

811
00:58:59,877 --> 00:59:02,809
And, Eleanor, over to you.

812
00:59:02,877 --> 00:59:05,900
Did you fancy Kafir
the first time that you saw him?

813
00:59:08,644 --> 00:59:11,838
This has been BridgetJones
for Sit Up, Britain...

814
00:59:11,911 --> 00:59:16,503
with, let's face it,
a bit of a crush now, actually.

815
00:59:16,578 --> 00:59:17,941
Good afternoon.

816
00:59:18,011 --> 00:59:22,068
BridgetJones.
Already a legend.

817
00:59:22,144 --> 00:59:25,974
I feel fantastic, bombastic
ecstatically astounded

818
00:59:26,044 --> 00:59:29,272
How a girl
can really lose her grip

819
00:59:29,345 --> 00:59:31,742
I feel surrounded, confounded

820
00:59:31,811 --> 00:59:34,403
Emotionally dumbfounded

821
00:59:34,478 --> 00:59:38,410
Oh, joy,
I am broadcasting genius.

822
00:59:38,478 --> 00:59:41,569
Celebrating by cooking birthday feast
for close friends.

823
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:46,339
Have sneaking suspicion am also genius
in the kitchen as well.

824
00:59:46,411 --> 00:59:50,968
Tie flavor-enhancing leek
and celery together with string.

825
00:59:51,044 --> 00:59:53,635
Right. String.

826
00:59:55,478 --> 00:59:57,376
Perfect.

827
01:00:01,078 --> 01:00:04,874
Finely slice oranges
and grate zest.

828
01:00:10,811 --> 01:00:12,243
Oh, bugger, bugger!

829
01:00:17,144 --> 01:00:19,735
Where the fuck
is the fucking tuna?

830
01:00:19,811 --> 01:00:23,743
This is BridgetJones for
Sit Up, Britain, searching for tuna.

831
01:00:29,345 --> 01:00:32,106
- Hello, darling.
- Hi, Mum.

832
01:00:32,178 --> 01:00:35,167
- I just wanted a bit of a chat.
- Ouch!

833
01:00:35,245 --> 01:00:37,642
Careful, you ham-fisted cow!

834
01:00:37,711 --> 01:00:40,337
The thing is, darling,
between you and me...

835
01:00:40,411 --> 01:00:43,672
I'm not entirely sure
thatJulian isn't a bit of a shit.

836
01:00:43,744 --> 01:00:46,506
Mum, I haven't really
got time right now.

837
01:00:46,577 --> 01:00:50,805
I can't deny the sex
is still very surprising.

838
01:00:50,877 --> 01:00:53,002
You know, the other night,
quite unexpectedly...

839
01:00:53,078 --> 01:00:55,306
I was just dozing off,
and I felt this huge...

840
01:00:55,378 --> 01:00:57,241
Bye, Mum.

841
01:01:01,777 --> 01:01:03,709
What time do you call this?

842
01:01:09,677 --> 01:01:11,540
The door was open.

843
01:01:12,478 --> 01:01:16,569
I came to congratulate the new face
of British current affairs.

844
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:24,869
But I see I may have come
at a bad time.

845
01:01:26,577 --> 01:01:28,509
How's it look?

846
01:01:28,577 --> 01:01:30,237
Great. It's...

847
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:31,776
blue.

848
01:01:31,844 --> 01:01:34,742
- Blue?
- No, but blue is good.

849
01:01:34,811 --> 01:01:37,107
If you ask me,
there isn't enough blue food.

850
01:01:37,178 --> 01:01:40,076
Oh, shit.
It must have been the string.

851
01:01:40,144 --> 01:01:42,337
Oh, it's string soup.

852
01:01:42,411 --> 01:01:44,933
Oh, God. They're gonna
be here any minute.

853
01:01:45,011 --> 01:01:47,636
Don't worry. I'm sure they've
come to see you and not...

854
01:01:47,711 --> 01:01:50,472
orange parfait in sugar cages.

855
01:01:50,544 --> 01:01:52,737
- Let's have a drink.
- Yes.

856
01:01:56,744 --> 01:01:58,335
Happy birthday.

857
01:01:58,411 --> 01:02:00,808
Thank you.

858
01:02:02,744 --> 01:02:05,233
Did I really run
round your lawn naked?

859
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:08,674
Oh, yes. You were four,
and I was eight.

860
01:02:08,744 --> 01:02:11,471
That's a pretty big age difference.

861
01:02:12,911 --> 01:02:14,740
It's quite pervy, really.

862
01:02:14,811 --> 01:02:16,868
Yes, I like to think so.

863
01:02:20,577 --> 01:02:23,203
What are we going to do
about this dinner, then?

864
01:02:25,144 --> 01:02:27,133
We can have blue soup to start...

865
01:02:27,211 --> 01:02:29,268
orange pudding to end...

866
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:31,503
and, well, for the main course
you have...

867
01:02:32,577 --> 01:02:34,168
congealed green gunge.

868
01:02:34,245 --> 01:02:37,904
That is caper berry gravy, actually.

869
01:02:37,978 --> 01:02:40,308
- Do you have eggs?
- Yes.

870
01:02:40,378 --> 01:02:42,502
Right. Omelette it is, then.

871
01:02:42,577 --> 01:02:44,373
With caper berry gravy.

872
01:02:48,211 --> 01:02:51,870
You wouldn't by any chance have
any beetroot cubes, would you?

873
01:02:52,978 --> 01:02:55,409
Minigherkin? Stuffed olive?

874
01:02:55,477 --> 01:02:57,137
No, Pam.

875
01:02:57,211 --> 01:03:00,336
And besides, I'm busy.
The gravy needs sieving.

876
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:02,399
Surely not. Just stir it, Una.

877
01:03:13,245 --> 01:03:14,938
Happy birthday!

878
01:03:15,011 --> 01:03:17,136
- TV queen!
- We're so proud!

879
01:03:17,211 --> 01:03:21,075
Bridge, you looked so fucking thin!
You looked fantastic!

880
01:03:23,477 --> 01:03:24,966
Hello.

881
01:03:25,978 --> 01:03:27,637
Are you joining us?

882
01:03:27,711 --> 01:03:30,041
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

883
01:03:49,344 --> 01:03:51,333
Excellent.

884
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:53,309
Delicious.

885
01:03:53,377 --> 01:03:56,468
- Really special.
- It's really very good.

886
01:03:56,544 --> 01:03:58,238
Really, it's very nice.

887
01:03:59,844 --> 01:04:01,901
So...

888
01:04:01,978 --> 01:04:04,773
Mark, why did your wife leave you?

889
01:04:04,844 --> 01:04:09,333
Eat up. Eat up.
Two more lovely courses to go.

890
01:04:15,644 --> 01:04:17,201
Mmm, delicious!

891
01:04:18,744 --> 01:04:22,335
I have to say,
this is the most incredible shit.

892
01:04:24,711 --> 01:04:27,234
This is the worst of the three.

893
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:29,640
It does remind me of something.
It tastes like...

894
01:04:29,711 --> 01:04:31,268
Marmalade.

895
01:04:31,344 --> 01:04:33,640
Well done, Bridge.
Four hours of careful cooking...

896
01:04:33,711 --> 01:04:36,007
and a feast of blue soup...

897
01:04:36,078 --> 01:04:38,669
- omelette and marmalade.
- Thank you.

898
01:04:38,744 --> 01:04:41,233
I think that deserves a toast.
To Bridget...

899
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:43,333
who cannot cook...

900
01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:45,876
but who we love just as she is.

901
01:04:47,178 --> 01:04:48,973
To Bridget...

902
01:04:49,044 --> 01:04:51,532
just as she is.

903
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:01,867
I'll go.

904
01:05:12,544 --> 01:05:13,669
Who?

905
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:17,806
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

906
01:05:17,877 --> 01:05:21,105
I'm obviously interrupting.

907
01:05:21,178 --> 01:05:22,973
Darcy.

908
01:05:24,244 --> 01:05:26,802
What brings you here?

909
01:05:26,877 --> 01:05:30,741
Right, yeah.
I should have guessed, shouldn't I?

910
01:05:30,811 --> 01:05:33,743
I'm Tom. It's really good
to meet you at last.

911
01:05:33,811 --> 01:05:36,743
Listen, I just came to...

912
01:05:36,811 --> 01:05:38,970
I thought you might be on your own.

913
01:05:39,044 --> 01:05:41,135
What an idiot.

914
01:05:44,011 --> 01:05:45,567
Excuse me.

915
01:05:52,844 --> 01:05:54,742
I've been going crazy.

916
01:05:54,811 --> 01:05:57,004
I can't stop thinking about you...

917
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:59,805
and thinking what
a fucking idiot I've been.

918
01:05:59,877 --> 01:06:02,570
Christ, is that blue soup?

919
01:06:02,644 --> 01:06:04,110
Yes.

920
01:06:04,178 --> 01:06:06,575
You know, that Sunday
in the country...

921
01:06:08,877 --> 01:06:10,866
Come on outside.

922
01:06:12,244 --> 01:06:15,075
It was all just going so fast...

923
01:06:15,144 --> 01:06:18,167
the hotel and that weekend,
meeting your parents.

924
01:06:18,244 --> 01:06:20,472
I just panicked.

925
01:06:20,544 --> 01:06:22,442
You know me. I'm...

926
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:27,102
I'm a terrible disaster with
a posh voice and a bad character.

927
01:06:27,177 --> 01:06:29,666
You're the only one who can save me.
I need you.

928
01:06:29,744 --> 01:06:32,801
Without you, 20 years from now,
I'll be in some seedy bar...

929
01:06:32,877 --> 01:06:35,172
with some seedy blonde.

930
01:06:35,244 --> 01:06:37,403
And what about Lara?

931
01:06:37,477 --> 01:06:40,466
Oh, over, over.
Totally fucking finito.

932
01:06:40,544 --> 01:06:42,271
Dumped me.

933
01:06:42,344 --> 01:06:46,436
Dumped me when she realized
I hadn't got over you.

934
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:49,601
I know you're thinking
it's just a sex thing...

935
01:06:49,677 --> 01:06:52,336
but I promise you, whenever I see...

936
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:54,342
that skimpy little skirt on TV...

937
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:58,274
I just close my eyes and listen to
all the intelligent things you'll say.

938
01:06:58,344 --> 01:07:01,572
I was thrilled that little
Kurdish bloke was set free.

939
01:07:05,344 --> 01:07:07,207
I've missed you a lot.

940
01:07:11,811 --> 01:07:13,709
I'm going now. Bye.

941
01:07:14,811 --> 01:07:16,436
Mark, stay.

942
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:18,476
No, I don't think I will.

943
01:07:18,544 --> 01:07:20,806
Don't leave on my behalf.

944
01:07:20,877 --> 01:07:25,071
It's about time you and I
put this past behind us, don't you?

945
01:07:26,244 --> 01:07:29,404
At least stay for a birthday drink
with me and Bridge, huh?

946
01:07:29,477 --> 01:07:31,500
Good-bye, Bridget.

947
01:07:39,711 --> 01:07:41,540
Why are you here?

948
01:07:44,011 --> 01:07:46,636
I just told you why I'm here.

949
01:07:46,711 --> 01:07:50,302
Why was Mark wanker Darcy here?
Oh, bloody hell.

950
01:07:50,377 --> 01:07:52,240
Wait a minute. He's back.

951
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:53,901
All right, Cleaver. Outside.

952
01:07:53,978 --> 01:07:55,637
I'm sorry?

953
01:07:55,711 --> 01:07:57,939
Outside?

954
01:07:58,011 --> 01:08:01,841
Should I bring my dueling pistols
or my sword?

955
01:08:04,477 --> 01:08:05,670
All right. Hang on.

956
01:08:15,077 --> 01:08:17,270
I should have done this years ago.

957
01:08:17,344 --> 01:08:19,207
- Done what?
- This.

958
01:08:20,544 --> 01:08:23,169
Fuck! Fuck me, that hurt!

959
01:08:24,911 --> 01:08:27,502
- What do you think you're doing?
- This.

960
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:31,874
Christ, not again.

961
01:08:33,544 --> 01:08:35,134
Fight!

962
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:37,073
What?

963
01:08:37,143 --> 01:08:40,234
- Where? Where?
- Well, quick! It's a real fight!

964
01:08:43,877 --> 01:08:46,638
All right. I give up. I give up.

965
01:08:46,711 --> 01:08:48,336
Give me a moment, all right?

966
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:51,570
Just let me get a moment's
break here, okay?

967
01:08:53,510 --> 01:08:55,373
Cheat! Cheat! Cheat!

968
01:09:04,911 --> 01:09:07,002
I'll shin you!

969
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:23,608
- Whose side are we on?
- Mark's, obviously.

970
01:09:23,677 --> 01:09:25,734
He's never dumped Bridget
for some naked American.

971
01:09:25,811 --> 01:09:27,800
And he said he liked her
just the way she is.

972
01:09:27,877 --> 01:09:30,604
But he also nicked Daniel's fiancee
and left him broken-hearted.

973
01:09:30,677 --> 01:09:33,074
Good point.
It's a very hard one to call.

974
01:09:46,143 --> 01:09:48,200
I'm so sorry.

975
01:09:50,010 --> 01:09:52,568
- What are you doing?
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.

976
01:09:52,644 --> 01:09:54,837
I really am sorry.
I will pay.

977
01:09:54,911 --> 01:09:58,900
- Enough, Darcy?
- Not quite, if that's all right by you.

978
01:10:00,677 --> 01:10:05,132
- You broke my bloody jaw!
- Happy birthday to you

979
01:10:08,877 --> 01:10:13,400
Happy birthday, dear what's-his-name

980
01:10:31,711 --> 01:10:33,506
Jesus.

981
01:10:39,811 --> 01:10:43,174
- All right. All right.
- Enough.

982
01:10:43,244 --> 01:10:44,835
Enough.

983
01:10:46,143 --> 01:10:48,006
Wanker.

984
01:11:01,344 --> 01:11:03,139
What is your problem?

985
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:05,005
- My problem?
- Yes!

986
01:11:05,077 --> 01:11:08,771
You give the impression
of being all moral and noble...

987
01:11:08,844 --> 01:11:11,968
and normal and helpful
in the kitchen...

988
01:11:12,043 --> 01:11:14,669
but you're just as bad
as the rest of them.

989
01:11:14,744 --> 01:11:19,403
Well, I can see that I've been
laboring under a misapprehension.

990
01:11:19,477 --> 01:11:24,034
Very, very foolish mistake.
Forgive me.

991
01:11:44,244 --> 01:11:46,903
Let's go back upstairs.

992
01:11:46,977 --> 01:11:48,739
Come on.

993
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:53,669
We belong together, Jones.

994
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:57,741
Me, you...

995
01:11:57,811 --> 01:11:59,901
poor little skirt.

996
01:12:02,077 --> 01:12:04,134
Right.

997
01:12:04,210 --> 01:12:07,972
If I can't make it with you...

998
01:12:08,043 --> 01:12:10,873
I can't make it with anyone.

999
01:12:20,410 --> 01:12:23,240
That's not a good enough
offer for me.

1000
01:12:24,744 --> 01:12:28,437
I'm not willing to gamble
my whole life on someone who's...

1001
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:31,169
not quite sure.

1002
01:12:33,010 --> 01:12:34,738
It's like you said:

1003
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:37,174
I'm still looking for something...

1004
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:40,572
more extraordinary than that.

1005
01:12:59,677 --> 01:13:01,643
Ding-dong merrily on high

1006
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:03,734
December 25th.

1007
01:13:03,810 --> 01:13:06,743
Weight: 140 pounds...

1008
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:08,674
plus 42 mince pies.

1009
01:13:09,711 --> 01:13:11,404
Alcohol units:

1010
01:13:11,477 --> 01:13:13,067
Oh, thousands.

1011
01:13:13,143 --> 01:13:14,836
Bugger off!

1012
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:16,842
Come on then, kids.

1013
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:21,307
This Baroque carriage clock is...

1014
01:13:21,377 --> 01:13:23,842
a particular festive
favorite of mine...

1015
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:28,434
incorporating the "Hallelujah Chorus"
from Handel's Messiah...

1016
01:13:28,510 --> 01:13:31,135
every hour, on the hour.

1017
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:34,074
I can't understand it.
The man's actually turned red now.

1018
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:35,734
Merry Christmas, Pamela.

1019
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:45,206
Well, I'm going to Bedfordshire.

1020
01:13:52,644 --> 01:13:54,405
- Night-night.
- Night-night.

1021
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:10,842
The thing is...

1022
01:14:11,977 --> 01:14:14,841
close up, he was almost purple.

1023
01:14:16,477 --> 01:14:19,738
You were such
a lovely normal color.

1024
01:14:19,810 --> 01:14:21,867
He had a filthy temper.

1025
01:14:23,977 --> 01:14:28,137
And, well, the jewelry is fabulous
and really very reasonably priced.

1026
01:14:30,244 --> 01:14:32,709
I thought I might ask if...

1027
01:14:34,544 --> 01:14:36,533
we could have another go.

1028
01:14:38,743 --> 01:14:42,937
Obviously with some effort on your part
to pay a bit more attention to me.

1029
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:45,942
I do realize
what I'm like sometimes.

1030
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:49,101
It doesn't help that you and Bridget
have your lovely grown-up club of two...

1031
01:14:49,177 --> 01:14:52,939
and always say, "What's silly old Mummy
gone and done this time?"

1032
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:56,101
You used to be mad about me.

1033
01:14:56,177 --> 01:14:58,200
You couldn't get enough of me.

1034
01:15:01,977 --> 01:15:03,738
What do you think?

1035
01:15:07,244 --> 01:15:09,369
I don't know, Pam.

1036
01:15:11,177 --> 01:15:13,075
I just don't know now.

1037
01:15:16,244 --> 01:15:18,039
It's been very hard.

1038
01:15:24,876 --> 01:15:27,468
I'm joking, you daft cow.

1039
01:15:31,843 --> 01:15:34,537
Pam, I just don't work without you.

1040
01:15:38,676 --> 01:15:40,336
Awful!

1041
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:46,774
Lovely, lovely, lovely.

1042
01:15:46,843 --> 01:15:50,503
- Get back up those stairs. Get dressed.
- What for?

1043
01:15:50,577 --> 01:15:53,168
The Darcys' ruby wedding party.

1044
01:15:53,244 --> 01:15:55,267
"What for," indeed!

1045
01:15:55,344 --> 01:15:57,901
Mark will be there.
Still divorced.

1046
01:15:57,977 --> 01:16:01,501
He's also still deranged.
I'm not going.

1047
01:16:01,577 --> 01:16:04,407
Poor Mark. This is always
a bad time of year for him.

1048
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:07,806
His Japanese wife left him
on Christmas Day. Cruel race.

1049
01:16:07,876 --> 01:16:11,172
Yes, but I'm not quite sure
he didn't deserve it, actually.

1050
01:16:11,244 --> 01:16:14,005
She ran off with his best friend
from Cambridge.

1051
01:16:14,077 --> 01:16:17,066
Total scoundrel, apparently.
Best man at his wedding.

1052
01:16:17,143 --> 01:16:19,234
Then Christmas Eve,
Mark comes home early from work...

1053
01:16:19,310 --> 01:16:22,333
finds the pair of them
in a most unorthodox position...

1054
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:24,739
stark naked, at it like rabbits.

1055
01:16:29,676 --> 01:16:32,142
Just give me five minutes.

1056
01:16:38,810 --> 01:16:42,265
Stop! Stop the car!

1057
01:16:42,344 --> 01:16:44,469
Dad, get out. Too slow!

1058
01:16:50,977 --> 01:16:53,909
- Dad, get in! Hurry!
- What's the hurry?

1059
01:16:56,043 --> 01:16:58,305
Not too fast.

1060
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:09,803
Bit snowy, isn't it?

1061
01:17:29,576 --> 01:17:31,667
Sorry. One moment.

1062
01:17:33,576 --> 01:17:35,906
Thank you for inviting me.

1063
01:17:35,977 --> 01:17:38,807
I didn't.
It must have been my parents.

1064
01:17:42,509 --> 01:17:44,498
So.

1065
01:17:48,043 --> 01:17:50,736
Hello, Bridget.
Didn't know you were coming.

1066
01:17:50,810 --> 01:17:54,742
Mark, your father
wants to begin ASAP.

1067
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:56,935
Does he? Right.

1068
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:59,737
Come on, Mark.
Be helpful, please.

1069
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:03,299
The caterers have totally screwed up.
Does nothing work outside of London?

1070
01:18:03,377 --> 01:18:05,002
Apparently not.

1071
01:18:08,977 --> 01:18:10,533
Listen.

1072
01:18:11,977 --> 01:18:16,171
I owe you an apology about Daniel.

1073
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:20,342
He said that you ran off
with his fiancee...

1074
01:18:20,410 --> 01:18:22,841
and left him
broken-hearted, he said.

1075
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:26,571
No, it was the other way around.

1076
01:18:26,643 --> 01:18:30,201
It was my wife.

1077
01:18:31,177 --> 01:18:33,234
My heart.

1078
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:36,299
Sorry.

1079
01:18:36,377 --> 01:18:40,070
That's why you always acted
so strangely around him...

1080
01:18:40,143 --> 01:18:43,303
and beat him to a pulp,
quite rightly.

1081
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:46,142
Well done.

1082
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:50,607
Can we just...

1083
01:18:50,676 --> 01:18:55,302
pop out there for a moment?

1084
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:08,106
I just have something
that I want to say.

1085
01:19:08,177 --> 01:19:12,109
You once said that you
liked me just as I am...

1086
01:19:12,177 --> 01:19:17,109
and I just wanted to say likewise.

1087
01:19:17,177 --> 01:19:20,939
I mean, there are stupid things
your mum buys you.

1088
01:19:21,010 --> 01:19:22,908
Tonight's another classic.

1089
01:19:22,977 --> 01:19:27,239
You're haughty and you always say
the wrong thing in every situation.

1090
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:32,571
And I seriously believe that you should
rethink the length of your sideburns.

1091
01:19:34,409 --> 01:19:36,739
But you're a nice man...

1092
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:38,367
and...

1093
01:19:40,143 --> 01:19:41,904
I like you.

1094
01:19:44,643 --> 01:19:48,337
If you wanted to pop by sometime,
that might be nice.

1095
01:19:51,876 --> 01:19:53,967
More than nice.

1096
01:19:56,244 --> 01:19:57,903
Right.

1097
01:19:59,244 --> 01:20:01,039
Crikey.

1098
01:20:03,376 --> 01:20:06,172
Ladies and gentlemen...

1099
01:20:06,244 --> 01:20:08,573
could I have your attention
for a moment, please?

1100
01:20:08,643 --> 01:20:10,404
Excuse me.

1101
01:20:13,643 --> 01:20:15,337
Of course.

1102
01:20:15,409 --> 01:20:17,932
...wife and companion Geraldine.

1103
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:22,965
A toast to her,
my wonderful wife Geraldine.

1104
01:20:23,043 --> 01:20:25,440
To Geraldine.

1105
01:20:25,509 --> 01:20:28,532
And we, in turn, have been
blessed with our son Mark.

1106
01:20:29,643 --> 01:20:31,336
He's always made us proud...

1107
01:20:31,409 --> 01:20:34,933
and we couldn't be prouder of him
than on this particular day...

1108
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:37,135
because I'm thrilled to announce...

1109
01:20:37,210 --> 01:20:39,732
he has just been invited
to be a senior partner...

1110
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:42,332
in the firm of Abbott & Abbott
in New York.

1111
01:20:46,743 --> 01:20:48,470
He also, incidentally...

1112
01:20:48,543 --> 01:20:52,135
takes with him his brilliant
partner in law, Natasha.

1113
01:20:52,210 --> 01:20:56,403
And I don't think they'll mind,
since we're amongst friends...

1114
01:20:56,476 --> 01:20:59,909
if I say that, someday,
this remarkably clever girl...

1115
01:20:59,977 --> 01:21:04,409
is going to be
something else in-law as well!

1116
01:21:10,210 --> 01:21:11,937
I begged him not to say anything.

1117
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:16,136
So I ask you now to charge
your glasses once again to...

1118
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:18,176
Mark and his Natasha.

1119
01:21:18,244 --> 01:21:21,573
- To Mark and his Natasha!
- No!

1120
01:21:27,210 --> 01:21:29,937
It's just that...

1121
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:33,033
it's such a terrible pity...

1122
01:21:36,376 --> 01:21:38,172
for England...

1123
01:21:38,244 --> 01:21:42,608
to lose such a great legal brain...

1124
01:21:42,676 --> 01:21:44,665
- Is she pissed?
- What?

1125
01:21:45,643 --> 01:21:47,700
For the people of England...

1126
01:21:49,343 --> 01:21:50,934
like me and you...

1127
01:21:51,010 --> 01:21:54,908
to lose one of our top people.

1128
01:21:57,576 --> 01:22:00,701
A top person, really.

1129
01:22:06,509 --> 01:22:09,304
Well, I better dash.

1130
01:22:09,376 --> 01:22:12,672
I've got another party to get to.

1131
01:22:12,743 --> 01:22:15,402
Loads of single people.

1132
01:22:15,476 --> 01:22:18,204
Mainly poofs.

1133
01:22:21,509 --> 01:22:23,407
Bye.

1134
01:22:38,876 --> 01:22:44,604
Knew the signs, wasn't right

1135
01:22:44,676 --> 01:22:46,403
I was stupid

1136
01:22:46,476 --> 01:22:48,999
For a while

1137
01:22:49,077 --> 01:22:51,634
Swept away

1138
01:22:51,710 --> 01:22:54,335
By you

1139
01:22:54,409 --> 01:22:57,103
And now I feel

1140
01:22:57,177 --> 01:22:59,836
Like a fool

1141
01:23:01,409 --> 01:23:04,898
So confused

1142
01:23:04,977 --> 01:23:06,602
My heart's bruised

1143
01:23:06,676 --> 01:23:10,335
Was I ever loved by you

1144
01:23:10,409 --> 01:23:12,841
Out of reach

1145
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:15,603
So far

1146
01:23:15,676 --> 01:23:20,802
I never had your heart

1147
01:23:20,876 --> 01:23:23,398
Out of reach

1148
01:23:23,476 --> 01:23:25,999
Couldn't see

1149
01:23:26,077 --> 01:23:30,338
We were never meant to be

1150
01:23:31,543 --> 01:23:35,135
Catch myself from despair

1151
01:23:36,643 --> 01:23:41,133
I could drown if I stay here

1152
01:23:42,043 --> 01:23:44,235
Keeping busy

1153
01:23:44,309 --> 01:23:47,434
Every day

1154
01:23:47,509 --> 01:23:50,339
I know I will be okay

1155
01:23:50,409 --> 01:23:52,000
Yes?

1156
01:23:52,077 --> 01:23:54,066
Hi! It's us!

1157
01:23:56,409 --> 01:23:58,807
Great. Come on up.

1158
01:24:00,509 --> 01:24:03,067
Have we got the most fantastic
surprise for you.

1159
01:24:03,142 --> 01:24:05,904
- You're not going to sing.
- Not that fantastic, sadly, no.

1160
01:24:05,977 --> 01:24:09,568
We've decided to take you to Paris
so you can forget about everything...

1161
01:24:09,643 --> 01:24:11,131
particularly forget
about Mark Darcy.

1162
01:24:11,209 --> 01:24:13,573
I can't believe you said
what you said you said.

1163
01:24:13,643 --> 01:24:17,007
I know! There goes my invite
to the Darcys' next year.

1164
01:24:17,077 --> 01:24:20,270
If he didn't leap over and whip you
up in his arms, then sod him.

1165
01:24:20,343 --> 01:24:24,833
Yes. He's clearly
the most dreadful cold fish.

1166
01:24:24,910 --> 01:24:27,967
Exactly. There's been all these
bloody hints and stuff...

1167
01:24:28,043 --> 01:24:31,066
but has he ever actually stuck
his tongue down your fucking throat?

1168
01:24:31,142 --> 01:24:33,165
No. Not once.

1169
01:24:33,243 --> 01:24:36,141
- I think we should pack.
- Passport, Bridget, and pants.

1170
01:24:36,209 --> 01:24:37,675
Yep. Pants.

1171
01:24:37,743 --> 01:24:40,800
Hurry up, Bridge.
We're freezing our bollocks off.

1172
01:24:40,876 --> 01:24:42,671
Yeah. Just the keys.

1173
01:24:44,010 --> 01:24:46,305
I'm stuck!

1174
01:24:49,343 --> 01:24:51,332
Come the fuck on, Bridget.

1175
01:24:52,743 --> 01:24:55,368
Close the door.

1176
01:24:58,676 --> 01:25:00,665
What are you doing here?

1177
01:25:00,743 --> 01:25:03,402
I just wanted to know
if you were available...

1178
01:25:03,476 --> 01:25:06,499
for bar mitzvahs and christenings
as well as ruby weddings.

1179
01:25:06,576 --> 01:25:08,166
Excellent speech.

1180
01:25:08,243 --> 01:25:10,300
I thought that you were in America.

1181
01:25:10,376 --> 01:25:13,342
Yes, I was, but...

1182
01:25:13,409 --> 01:25:16,398
I realized I'd forgotten
something back home.

1183
01:25:16,476 --> 01:25:18,704
Which was?

1184
01:25:19,876 --> 01:25:24,069
I realized I'd forgotten to...

1185
01:25:24,142 --> 01:25:26,335
kiss you good-bye.
Do you mind?

1186
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:31,736
Not really, no.

1187
01:25:35,209 --> 01:25:39,733
So, you're not going to America, then?

1188
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:42,469
No. Not.

1189
01:25:42,543 --> 01:25:44,600
You're staying here?

1190
01:25:44,676 --> 01:25:47,540
So it would seem.

1191
01:25:52,076 --> 01:25:54,133
Friends of yours?

1192
01:25:55,710 --> 01:25:58,972
No, I've never seen them
before in my life.

1193
01:25:59,042 --> 01:26:01,133
Are you coming to Paris or not?

1194
01:26:02,409 --> 01:26:03,807
Not.

1195
01:26:03,876 --> 01:26:05,967
No fucking room anyway.

1196
01:26:06,042 --> 01:26:08,975
Maybe we should just
go upstairs for a minute.

1197
01:26:09,042 --> 01:26:12,975
- Very good idea.
- No room for him either.

1198
01:26:22,476 --> 01:26:24,908
Give me just a minute.

1199
01:26:24,977 --> 01:26:26,966
Keep yourself busy.
Read something.

1200
01:26:27,042 --> 01:26:29,804
Lots of very high-quality
magazines...

1201
01:26:29,876 --> 01:26:34,433
with helpful fashion
and romance tips.

1202
01:26:34,509 --> 01:26:36,634
I'll be right with you.

1203
01:26:43,543 --> 01:26:46,475
Definitely an occasion for...

1204
01:26:46,543 --> 01:26:48,668
genuinely tiny knickers.

1205
01:27:18,843 --> 01:27:20,638
Right.

1206
01:27:52,376 --> 01:27:54,399
Oh, shit!

1207
01:28:00,743 --> 01:28:02,641
Double shit.

1208
01:28:12,009 --> 01:28:13,669
Bollocks!

1209
01:28:13,743 --> 01:28:15,538
Oh, God.

1210
01:28:22,009 --> 01:28:25,703
- Wish me luck!
- Good luck, crazy girl!

1211
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:09,801
I'm so sorry.

1212
01:29:11,710 --> 01:29:15,073
I didn't mean it.
I mean, I meant it.

1213
01:29:15,142 --> 01:29:20,234
But I was so stupid
that I didn't mean what I meant.

1214
01:29:23,543 --> 01:29:26,304
Oh, for Christ's sakes.

1215
01:29:28,643 --> 01:29:31,632
It's only a diary.

1216
01:29:31,710 --> 01:29:35,198
Everyone knows diaries
are just full of crap.

1217
01:29:38,643 --> 01:29:40,438
I know that.

1218
01:29:40,509 --> 01:29:44,339
I was just buying you a new one.
Time to make a new start, perhaps.

1219
01:30:30,509 --> 01:30:32,974
Wait a minute.

1220
01:30:33,042 --> 01:30:35,565
Nice boys don't kiss like that.

1221
01:30:35,643 --> 01:30:38,336
Oh, yes, they fuckin' do.

1222
01:31:39,543 --> 01:31:42,940
I'm delighted. They're both
really good friends of mine.

1223
01:31:43,009 --> 01:31:46,442
And I think it's great that
they've found each other at last.

1224
01:31:46,509 --> 01:31:50,168
Brilliant, brilliant.
This is Pauline, by the way.

1225
01:31:50,243 --> 01:31:51,970
Paula.

1226
01:31:54,076 --> 01:31:55,701
Sorry.

1227
01:32:05,543 --> 01:32:07,634
How marvellous! Marvellous!

1228
01:32:07,709 --> 01:32:09,937
Nice, healthy, well-built girl.

1229
01:32:10,009 --> 01:32:12,975
Can't be doing with a girl
who's just skin and bone.

1230
01:32:13,042 --> 01:32:16,633
I like a woman with a backside you can
park your bike in and rest a pint on.

1231
01:32:16,709 --> 01:32:18,073
Malcolm.

1232
01:32:26,243 --> 01:32:28,471
Well, obviously, I'm disappointed.

1233
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:30,974
Bitterly disappointed.

1234
01:32:31,042 --> 01:32:33,065
But just 'cause someone's
got a boyfriend...

1235
01:32:33,142 --> 01:32:35,335
doesn't necessarily mean they won't...

1236
01:32:36,809 --> 01:32:38,366
you know...

1237
01:32:49,476 --> 01:32:51,941
No, there's absolutely no bitterness...

1238
01:32:52,009 --> 01:32:53,804
no hard feelings.

1239
01:32:53,875 --> 01:32:57,273
I just think it's great that in the same
month that Bridge found Darce...

1240
01:32:57,343 --> 01:32:59,275
I found Melani.

1241
01:32:59,343 --> 01:33:01,138
It's Alan.
