1
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,718
到佛罗里达还有多远?
How much further is it to Florida?

2
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,188
不太远了,地平线一过就到了.
Not too far now, just over the horizon.

3
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,953
我们能成功,对吗?
We will make it, won't we?

4
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,194
上帝会为我们指引方向.
God will show us the way.

5
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,951
如果美国人抓住我们,会不会把我们送回古巴?
If the Americans catch us,
will they send us back to Cuba?

6
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,833
他们会怎样对待我们?
What will happen to us then?

7
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,439
他们不会抓到我们的.
They won't catch us.

9
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,710
再试试.
Try it.

10
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,120
不行,发动不了.
It's not going to work.

11
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,199
看!那边!有条船!
Look! Over there! A boat!

欢迎来美国!
Welcome to the United States.

15

谢谢你!
Thank you.

16
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,633
够了!停下!
Enough! Stop!

Stop!

Oh, Madre de Dios.

It's down there.

21

- Cassidy, FBI.
- 中尉，他们来了.
- Lieutenant, they're here.

25

- 这儿你负责?
- You in charge?
- 中尉汤姆格林,重案组.
- Lieutenant Tom Green, Homicide.

26
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,670
- 什么情况?
- What happened?
- 一艘海岸警卫船上发现了一些尸体.
- A fishing trawler found them.

27
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,155
- 船被拖了回来.
- The tugs pulled her in.
- 有目击者吗?
- Any witnesses?

28
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,433
没有,海岸警卫队说, 最后一次无线电联系时
No, the Coastguard said she was
on a routine smuggling prevention patrol

29
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,995
它是在进行例行防走私巡逻.
the last time they made radio contact.

30
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,070
- 谁上过那船?
- Who's been on board?
- 我的人.一些海岸警卫队员.
- My men. Some coastguard brass.

31
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,953
还有一个记者.
And a reporter.

32
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,071
她在我们之前就到了.
She got here before we did.

33
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,829
- 她碰什么东西了吗?
- Did she touch anything?
- 我想没有.
- I don't think so.

34

- 她在哪儿?
- Where is she?
- 那边.
- Over there.

35

- 查查她.
- Check her out.
我什么坏事都没干! 
I haven't done anything wrong!

36
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,918
放开我!把手拿开!拜托.
Let me go!
Take your hands off me! Come on.

37
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,318
- 冷静点.
- Take it easy.
- 记者证.
- Press pass.

38

那些混蛋在抢我的报道,这俩个家伙却住着我不放.
These two bozos have been holding me
while those bastards scoop my story.

39
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,239
让我们来接手吧.你替谁工作, 麦奎尔小姐?
We'll take it from here.
Who do you work for, Miss McGuire?

40
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,590
给自己干.关你们什么事?
I work for me. What's it to you?

41
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,634
- 你怎么会比警察来得早?
- How'd you get here before the police?
- 我开车快.
- I drive faster.

42
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,798
事实上,我能收到警察的无线电.这违法吗?
Actually, I've got a police-band radio.
Is that illegal?

43
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,515
- 你无权上船.
- You had no authority to board.
- 我在报道新闻.
- I was covering a story.

44
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,678
- 你拍照了吗?
- Did you take any?
- 我当然拍了.
- Of course I took photographs.

45
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,110
这是我的工作.
That's how I make my living.

46
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,155
那你们不会追究上船的事儿,只想看看我的照片,
So you'll forget about the trespassing,
but you've got to take a look at my film.

47
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,316
对吗?
Right?

48
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,832
你们这些混蛋没听说过<第一修正案>吗?
(美国宪法，内容有关新闻、出版自由等)
Didn't you bastards ever hear
about the First Amendment?

49
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,749
就这儿.
This is it.

50
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,878
- 抓住它了.我抓住它了.抓住嘴了.
- Got him. I got him. Got his mouth.
- 好了.
- OK.

51
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,038
- 你爷爷以前就是这样捆的吗?
- Is this how your grandaddy used to do it?
- 开什么玩笑!
- Are you kidding?

52
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,550
放下去.
Get down.

53
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,955
乖乖躺着.
Keep him down.

54
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,391
受不了这狗屁活了.下次我来捆,好吗?
None of this Tonto kind of bullshit.
Next time, I'm doing the roping, OK?

55
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,750
好的.
Yeah.

56
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,915
哦,
OK.

57
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,395
很有个性.
Impress me.

59
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,309
你出去.
Get out of here.

60
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,429
这里一切就绪.
We're ready to rock and roll here.

61
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,394
你跟这个外国佬说吧.
You get that greaser on the phone.

62
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,917
东西都齐了.
It's all here.

给他吧.
Let him have it.

66

跟你做生意总是那么愉快.
It's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

67
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,192
愉快是属于我的.
The pleasure is all mine.

我不清楚,约翰依格.
I don't know, John Eagle.

71
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,956
- 它看上去不怎么样.
- He don't look too good.
- 他们都那样.
- They all look like that.

72
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,199
- 它怎么看着那么疲惫?
- Then how come he looks so tired?
- 瞎说.
- Shit.

73
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,351
好吧.
OK.

74
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,269
马特,能帮忙把这家伙抬上去吗?
Matt, wanna give us a hand
loading this sucker?

75
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,672
社保署发现你赚外快你怎么办?
What will you do when Social Security
find out you're moonlighting?

76
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,158
发现不了我的汽船生意,我都干了40年了.
Ain't found out about my airboat
business. Been doing it for 40 years.

77
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,636
大概是因为你39年都没挣到钱.
Probably because you haven't made
a profit for 39.

78
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,912
帮个忙把这该死的爬行动物抬上去.
Just give us a hand
loading the damn reptile.

晚上过来吃饭?
You wanna come to dinner tonight?

81
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,876
我抓了几只活的,炒、蒸、烤，随你便.
Got some live ones. Fried, steamed,
barbecued. Your choice.

82
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,674
老天，我讨厌青蛙.
God, I'm sick of frogs.

83
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,549
真没劲.
I'm not interested.

84
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,476
局里这次真的需要你.
The company really needs you
this time.

85
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,356
老生常谈了，找个正规的特工吧.
I've heard that story before.
Go to one of the regular agents.

86
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,472
哦，这次可不一样.
Well, this one is special.

87
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,911
我们确信罗斯塔夫就在国内.
We believe Rostov is in the country.

88
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,551
我有机会，可你们不让我杀他，现在你们自己解决吧.
You should've let me kill him when
I had the chance. Now he's your problem.

89
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,678
大使先生，欢迎光临寒舍.
Mr Ambassador, welcome to my home.

President.

这次不行,罗斯塔夫.
Not this time, Rostov.

92

亨特.
Hunter.

93
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,628
时候到了.
It's time to die.

94
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,320
又做梦了?
The dream again?

95
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,595
是梦魇.
The nightmare.

96
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,839
行动开始前我们必须杀了那个混蛋.
We have to kill that bastard
before we begin the operation.

97
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:13,716
这将意味着公然出去冒险.
It would mean coming out
into the open, risking everything.

98
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:20,153
忘了他吧.那样做只会使我们分散注意、远离目标.
Forget him. It would only distract us
from our purpose here.

99
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,635
我要杀了他!
I want it done!

100
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,234
他就一个人,光杆司令.
He's one man, alone.

101
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,874
他能做什么?
What can he do?

102
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,117
你陷太深了.
You're obsessed.

103
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,558
你只知道他的名声,
You only know his reputation.

104
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,479
我可知道他的手段.
But I know his work.

105
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,833
他们不会容忍他的做法.
They will not tolerate it.

106
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,590
现在他们必须得接受,不是吗?
They will just have to now, won't they?

107
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,791
好了,米哈伊尔,
Please, Mikhail.

108
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,912
别招惹亨特.
Leave Hunter alone.

109
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,111
他不是什么威胁.
He's not a threat.

110
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,829
只要他有呼吸,他就是个威胁.
As long as he's breathing,
he's a threat.

Spineless decadents.

They don't even understand
the nature of their own freedom

- Yeah, yeah, I know.
- 亨特?亨特!
- Hunter? Hunter!

142
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,398
- 你要干嘛?
- What are you doing?
- 你得买单!
- Gonna pay the check?

143
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,750
让我摊上这该死的事..
Give me the damn thing.

144
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,515
- 至少20辆车,先生,也许会有40辆.
- At least 20 vehicles, sir, maybe even 40.
- 什么车型?
- What kind?

145
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,712
痕迹都不太清楚,但估计是卡车.
The tracks are mostly obliterated,
but we'd say trucks.

146
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,673
- 多大?
- How big?
- 各种尺寸,而且满载.
- All sizes. Fully loaded too.

147
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,509
- 没发现毒品痕迹,长官.
- No trace of drugs, sir.
- 这不是毒品走私.
- This isn't a drug-smuggling operation.

148
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,836
会是什么呢,长官?
What is it, sir?

149
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,678
车是哪儿制造的?
Where were they made?

150
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,677
美国.我有序列号.
In the States.
I have the serial numbers.

151
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,190
马上联系国防部销售办公室,追查买家.
Contact the DOD surplus sales office.
Start running down the buyer.

152
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:22,791
- 我想知道他们从哪来的.
- I wanna know where these came from.
- 可是,长官,这些车都是40年以上的.
- But, sir, these are over 40 years old.

153
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,719
你要因此停止工作,是吗?
You got your work cut out for you,
don't you?

154
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,434
这是大事,真正的大事.
This is big, real big.

155
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,996
- 你说什么,长官?
- Did you say something, sir?
- (记者)嗨,伙计们,笑一下.
- (reporter) Hey, guys, smile.

156
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,677
对这儿的新闻有什么至理真言吗?
Got any words of wisdom
for the press?

157
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,515
好吧.那么,让我换个说法.
Right. Well, let me rephrase it.

158
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,599
你们知道这他妈的到底发生了什么?
You got any idea
what the hell's going on around here?

159
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,278
嗨,牛仔.
Hey, cowboy.

160
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,870
哦,得了吧,伙计们.别管我,好吗?
Oh, come on, guys.
Give me a break, will you?

162
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,154
- 圣诞快乐!
- Merry Christmas!
- 圣诞快乐!
- Merry Christmas!

163
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,834
爸爸,今年能让我挂星星吗?
Daddy, can I put the star up this year?

164
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,112
- 不, 我来挂.
- No, I'm putting it up.
- 去年都是你挂的.
- You put it up last year.

165
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,675
- 那是因为我比你大.
- That's because I'm older.
- 今年我来挂.
- I'll put it up this year.

166
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,589
- 太不公平了.
- That's no fair.
- 开饭了.
- Time for dinner.

167
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,759
- 哦,真不巧.
- Oh, not now.
- 好了,我们待会儿再做.
- Come on, we'll finish this later.

168
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,317
我们来了.
We're coming.

169
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,430
快点.
Come on.

170
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,510
- 我真的得走了.
- I've really gotta go.
- 不要啊.
- Come on.

171
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,075
再待五分钟.
Five more minutes.

173
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,556
他们多么镇定自若,是吗尼克?
They make it so easy,
don't they, Nikko?

174
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,558
把它给我!
Give it to me!

175
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,434
快来.
Come on.

177
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,595
哦,天哪.
Oh, my God.

180
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,955
- 想见见他们吗?
- You wanna meet them?
- 不.
- No.

181
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,594
来吧,我知道你想见他们.
Come on, vamos,
I know you wanna meet them.

182
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,553
这些女孩应该不会对我无动于衷.
Estas chicas, they wouldn't
have nothing to do with me.

183
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,276
你应该试试,伙计.(西班牙语)
You've gotta try, man. (speaks Spanish)

184
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,758
来吧,我教你,放松点.
Come on.
I'm gonna show you. Just relax.

185
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,748
- 我要说点什么?
- What am I gonna say?
- 别担心,伙计,看我的.
- Don't worry, man, that's up to me.

186
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,671
- 晚上好,女士们.
- Buenas noches, ladies.
- 你好.
- Hola.

187
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,793
- 我这位朋友认为你很迷人.
- My friend here thinks you are a fox.
- 托尼奥,伙计.
- Tonio, man.

188
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,671
你们能不能放过我们一次?
How about if you guys
give us a break for once?

189
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,676
你们这帮家伙总是这么讨厌.
It's always the same bullshit
with you dudes.

190
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,596
我希望你们比上星期那两个能友好些
I hope you guys are a little more
friendly than the two last week.

191
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,191
够了.
Enough.

192
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,437
要留下目击者.
He wants witnesses.

194
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,677
- 为什么?
- Why?
- 不知道.
- I don't know.

195
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,874
肯定有原因,肯定有什么原因.
There has to be a reason.
There just has to be a reason.

196
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,310
他们又回来了!
They're coming back!

197
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,918
混蛋!杀了他们!
Sons of bitches! Kill them!

202
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,635
你他妈的看什么?去死吧.
What the fuck are you looking at?
Fuck you.

204
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,750
- 想来点吗?
- Do you want some?
- 来吧,你这混蛋.
- Come on, motherfucker.

207
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,438
站住.你要去哪儿?
Hold it. Where are you going?

208
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,111
- 我想我不认识你,伙计.
- I don't think I know you, pal.
- 那扯平了.我也不认识你.
- Makes us even. I don't know you, either.

209
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:09,029
你不必认识我,混蛋.你是来花钱还是挣钱?
You don't have to know me, asshole.
Are you buying or selling?

210
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,676
- 只是看看.
- Just looking.
- 不,不,你不能在这儿看.
- No, no, you don't look here.

211
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,996
这儿可没有西洋镜.
This ain't no peepshow.

212
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,760
如果有生意,就去做.
You got business, do it.

213
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,996
You got that, hunk?
听懂了吗,帅哥?

214
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:24,159
我不确定.你再动我一下试试?
I'm not sure.
You wanna run that by me again?

215
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,396
- 这下行了,我想我懂了.
That's OK. I think I get it.

216
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,239
混蛋.
Son of a bitch.

217
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,750
- 嗨,马特.
- Hi, Matt.
- 生意怎么样?
- How's business?

218
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,678
蓬勃发展.
Just booming.

219
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,229
抱歉.如今,随便什么人都愿意为钱发动战争.
Sorry. All sorts of amateurs these days
are willing to fight wars for money.

220
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,115
- 我在找罗斯塔夫.
- I'm looking for Rostov.
- 罗斯塔夫?
- Rostov?

221
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:06,313
你认为他在幕后操纵?不会的,他在欧洲.
You think he's behind all this?
He can't be. He's in Europe.

222
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,670
他在这儿.
He's here.

223
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,235
我要找到他.
I gotta find him.

224
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,193
亨特,你知道,你总是这么性急.
You know,
you never had any patience, Hunter.

225
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,111
我没时间了.别忘了我在南美救了你一命,你欠我的.
I don't have time. Besides, you owe me
for saving your ass in South America.

226
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,714
昨晚我在眼镜蛇酒吧见过一些生面孔.
I saw some strange new faces
last night at the King Cobra.

227
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,717
看上去都是老手.
Looked real experienced.

228
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,876
我认为他们在进行某项行动.
I'd say they were in the business.

229
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,833
可能是罗斯塔夫的手下,我不清楚.
Might be some of Rostov's people.
I don't know.

230
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,312
- 地狱见.
- See you in hell.
- 给我寄明信片.
- Send me a postcard.

231
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,752
多谢.
Thanks.

232
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,318
麻烦总是会跟着你走,是吗?
Trouble sure has a way
of following you around, doesn't it?

233
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,671
这种事到处都有.或者是你没注意到?
This is going on everywhere.
Or haven't you noticed?

234
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,555
这些混蛋仅仅昨晚就袭击了迈阿密20多个地方.
These bastards hit over 20 places
in Miami alone last night.

235
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:11,515
我不知道今天会有多少.他们让大家彼此敌对起来.
I don't know how many today. They're
turning the people against each other.

236
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,517
并且更糟的是,反抗政府.
And, worse, against authority.

237
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:18,077
我们的人民受到威胁时不会沉默.他们会奋起反抗.
Our people don't take it when they're
threatened. They stand up and fight back.

238
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,590
因此每个事件都会以十倍以上的规模扩大.
So every incident like this
breeds ten more exactly like it.

239
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,554
我没甚至没办法解决半数的问题.
We don't even have the resources
to deal with half of them.

240
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,671
我无法相信这里会发生这种事儿,长官.
I can't believe
this is happening here, sir.

241
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,190
...而且另有20人受伤。
..and another 20 are injured.

242
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:39,474
公共事业公司说，气体泄漏不可能导致这样一连串的爆炸
The utility company says no gas leak
could cause such a string of explosions.

243
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,070
整个东南部今天火灾频发.
It has also been a day of fires
throughout the south-east...

244
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,635
伏特加.
A vodka.

245
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,238
还有啤酒,谢谢.
And a beer, thank you.

246
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,718
...尽管采取了七级火警处置,还是被夷为平地,
..burned to the ground
despite a seven-alarm effort to stop

247
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,434
一位消防队长称之为“火焰墙”.
what one fire marshal called
''a wall of flame''.

248
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:59,030
昨晚开始的难以理解的暴力浪潮
The wave of violence that began
inexplicably last night

249
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,789
今天继续加强并席卷全国.
is continuing and intensifying
all across the nation today.

250
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,118
当局目前已经无力阻止.
Authorities have thus far been helpless
in their efforts to prevent it.

251
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,675
他们在全世界制造爆炸已经很多年了.
They've been blowing
up the world for years.

252
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,758
我只是惊讶这些混蛋这么久才到这里.
I'm just surprised it took the bastards
this long to get here.

253
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,748
- 英雄所见略同.
- Precisely my sentiments.
- （电视）恐怖分子来自哪里?
- Where do the terrorists come from?

254
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,078
- 圣诞快乐.
- Merry Christmas.
- （电视）每个美国人今天都在问.
- ..every American is asking today.

255
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,355

00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,639
你回来见安吉拉了?
You came back to see Angela, eh?

258
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,796
没有.
No.

不过见你也行.
But you'll do.

Screw these guys.
We'll celebrate, huh?

262
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,635
你自己乐吧.我们没时间在这扯淡.
Screw yourself first.
We don't got time for this shit.

263
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:32,833
哦,真的? 你为什么不喝杯香槟?
Oh, yeah?
Why don't you drink the champagne?

264
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:38,230
我要去见世面了.回头见.
I'm gonna see the world.
I'll see you later.

- 当心我的手.当心我的手.
- Watch my hand. Watch my hand.
- 对不起.
- Sorry.

268
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,676
走开.
Beat it.

维克多!维克多!
Victor! Victor!

270

- 罗斯塔夫在哪儿?
- Where's Rostov?
- 我不知道,伙计.
- I don't know, man.

271
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,599
没人知道他在哪儿.他总是行踪不定.
Nobody knows how to find him.
He's on the move all the time.

272
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,950
- 罗斯塔夫!
- Rostov! 

273
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:49,750
- 我只听从他的命令做事.
- I only do what he tells me to.
- 这是怎么回事儿?
- What's going on?

274
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:57,395
如果你回来,我会使劲打你右边,你会求我打左边的.
If you come back, I'll hit you with
so many rights, you'll beg for a left.

Oh, yeah?

I wanna know

维克多!(西班牙语)
Victor! (speaks Spanish)

279
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,475
他要杀了他.他有刀.
He's gonna kill him. He has a knife.

280
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,439
起来!
Arriba!

281
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,279
我就知道这些,伙计.
That's all I know, man.

282
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,314
但是太迟了.我现在就该在那儿.
But it's too late.
I was supposed to be there by now.

283
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,080
现在去已经晚了.
That place is history.

284
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,635
你打算干什么,硬汉?
What are you gonna do now,
tough guy?

285
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,474
你开始激怒我了.
You're beginning to irritate me.

286
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,398
你疯了伙计,你疯了.当心,婊子.
You're crazy, man. You're crazy.
Watch out, bitch.

287
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:15,234
如果你能活着,告诉罗斯塔夫.
If you live through this, tell Rostov,

288
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,079
“时候到了.”
''lt's time to die.''

289
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,034
<i>(西班牙语)</i>

291
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,240
你这小鬼.
You little brat.

294
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,832
- 谢谢.嗯,这个真漂亮.
- Thank you. Mmm, this is nice.
- 我去年不是给她送过了.
- I think I got that for her last year.

295
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,519
也许她还想要呢.
She probably needs some more.

296
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,156
我不知道.也许我该送她一件晚礼服.
I don't know.
Maybe I ought to get her a night gown.

297
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,316
- 那个人忘拿包了.
- That man left his package.
- 哦.嘿,先生.
- Oh. Hey, mister.

298
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,511
嘿,先生!先生!
Hey, mister! Mister!

299
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,194
你忘拿包了,先生.嘿,哥们.嘿,先生.
You forgot your package, mister.
Hey, buddy. Hey, mister.

300
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:47,916
嘿，你的包。嘿，伙计，嘿！
Hey, your packages. Hey, pal. Hey!

301
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,998
嘿!
Hey!

302
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,951
嘿,先生!
Hey, mister!

303
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,196
嘿, 你.
Hey, you.

305
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:37,199
你这蠢货.到底怎么了?
Stupid son of a bitch. What in the hell...?

307
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,470
真该死,牛仔.
Goddam it, cowboy.

308
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,071
嗷!
Ow!

309
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:36,270
撞他们屁股,牛仔.
Bust their butt, cowboy.

311
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,153
- 抓住她.
- Grab her.
- 什么?
- What?

312
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,316
- 准备好.
- Get ready.
- 哦!
- Oh!

313
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,396
来吧,加速.
Come on, move up.

314
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,195
来呀.
Come on.

315
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,557
过来!
Come on!

317
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,350
车开得不错,牛仔.
Thanks for the ride, cowboy.

318
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:44,309
- 你跟他说什么了?
- What did you tell him?
- 你疯了,伙计.
- You're crazy, man.

319
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,078
亨特死了,他死了.
Hunter is dead. He's dead.

320
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:49,989
你不跟我们逛商场实在是欠考虑.
Your failure to go shopping with us
was most inconsiderate.

321
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:54,990
- 我被个姑娘缠住了.
- I got caught up with some chick.
- 看来你告诉亨特了,是不是?
- You talked to Hunter, now, didn't you?

322
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,270
怎么会这样?
How could this be?

323
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:02,031
- 看起来我杀死他了,是吗?是吗?
- I killed him, now, didn't I? Didn't I?
- 是的.
- Yes.

324
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,312
可是他在那儿而你没在.
But he was there and you were not.

325
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:10,230
怎么会这样?只有一种可能性.
How could this be?
There is only one way this could be.

326
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,398
你告诉他了.
You talked to him.

327
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:17,149
他说什么了?他说什么了?!
What did he say? What did he say?!

328
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:22,439
他让我告诉你,
He told me to tell you,

329
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,835
''时候到了.''

330
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,072
米哈伊尔!
Mikhail! 

331
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,430
我必须杀了亨特.
I have to kill Hunter.

332
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,435
我们不能为此而分心.
We cannot be distracted
from our work.

333
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,029
现在就要去..
It will be done now.

334
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:45,115
我们的人得去执行任务,
We can't afford to divert our men
from their assignments

335
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:48,073
不能只为了一个人忙活.
to try and find just one man.

336
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:52,037
- 我自己去杀他.
- I will do it myself.
- 不,米哈伊尔.
- No, Mikhail.

337
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,197
他们随时准备牺牲.
They're all expendable.

338
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,393
但是没有你指挥的话,
But without you to hold it together,

339
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:06,115
行动会功亏一篑.
the operation will fall apart.

340
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:09,437
没有你的领导,
Without your leadership,

341
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:14,634
他们会是一盘散沙,成不了大事.
they would be disorganised,
undisciplined petty criminals.

342
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:19,120
没有你他们什么都不是.
They're nothing without you.

343
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,229
那个英雄开的是辆什么车?
What about the vehicle
this hero was driving?

344
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:32,718
绕了一圈又回到车的问题上了,那辆车是个印度人的.
Led us right back to where we started,
belonged to some Indian.

345
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,957
- 他说了些什么?
- What'd he have to say?
- 什么也没说,他死了.
- Nothing. He's dead.

346
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,994
顺便说一下，卡车两小时前从保管站失踪了。
By the way, the truck disappeared from
the impound yard two hours ago.

347
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:44,876
- 我们面对的是一个相当棘手的活.
- We're doing one hell of a job.
- 几乎一半的人打电话请了病假.
- Almost half our people called in sick.

348
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,674
他们要待在家里保护家人.
They're staying at home
to protect their families.

349
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:51,475
警察那边情况更糟,武装百姓已经走上街头.
The police are in even worse shape.
Armed citizens have taken to the streets.

350
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:55,832
他们不会孤单的.国民警卫队15分钟前已经赶到了.
They won't be lonely. The Guard
hit the street 15 minutes ago.

351
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,236
能看看你的证件吗?
Do you have any ID?

352
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,919
可以.
Yeah.

353
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,639
想说点什么吗?
Feel like talking?

354
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,273
(俄语)

355
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,436
我不这样想.
I didn't think so.

356
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,956
- 你怎么样?
- How about you?
- 别开枪.
- Don't shoot.

357
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,799
- 别杀我.
- Don't kill me.
- 罗斯塔夫在哪儿?
- Where's Rostov?

358
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,997
我不知道.
I don't know.

359
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,399
他在战区,指挥所有行动.
He's in the field, leading the operations.

360
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,794
接着说.
I'm listening.

361
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:25,798
所有居民,离开街道.
All citizens are urged
to stay off the streets.

362
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,949
重复一遍,离开街道,这里不安全.
I repeat, stay off the streets.
They are not safe.

363
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:34,789
待在家里,不要离开.
Stay in your homes.
Do not leave your homes.

364
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,677
所有居民,离开街道. 
All citizens are urged
to stay off the streets.

365
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:58,159
所有居民,离开街道.
All citizens are urged
to stay off the streets.

366
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:02,319
重复一遍,离开街道.
I repeat, stay off the streets.

367
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,031
(俄语)

368
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,911
(俄语)

370
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,878
哦主啊,我们的上帝,
O Lord, our god,

371
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:40,358
在此危难之时,请保佑我们的孩子.
help and protect thy children
in this, our time of need.

372
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,950
一场灾难即将来临.
An evil stalks the land.

373
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:47,516
它让兄弟反目,父子成仇.
It pits brother against brother
and father against son.

374
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:56,718
现在,让我们一起向主祈祷.
Now may we pray together
the Lord's Prayer.

375
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:00,278
“天父啊,神圣的是你的...”
''Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed...''

376
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:29,396
亨特杀了光洋和他的手下.
Hunter killed Koyo.
And everyone with him.

377
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:33,275
- 再派人去.
- Send someone else.
- 米哈伊尔,不可能了.
- Mikhail, impossible.

378
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,191
赶快把活干完!
Finish this quickly!

384
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,313
(俄语)

386
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,270
出问题了?
Didn't work, huh?

387
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,316
现在好了.
Now it will.

388
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:16,950
好吧,现在听我说.听着.
All right, now listen to me. Listen.

389
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:20,994
由于公路状况的恶化，
Because of the deteriorating
situation on the highways,

390
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:26,479
今天我们还是没有肉类和其他产品供应.
we have no fresh meat or produce
again today.

391
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,631
稍等一下.
Wait a minute.

392
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,592
停下.
Hold it.

393
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,916
等等,听着.
Wait, listen.

394
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:40,434
为了让剩余的罐头保证供应,
In order to ensure there is enough
remaining canned stock to go around,

395
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:46,317
我们只能再次限制每人配给为12个.
we're going to have to limit everyone
to 12 items again.

400
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,070
亨特,做点什么,该死的!
Hunter, do something, you shit!

401
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:53,115
亨特!
Hunter!

402
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,916
亨特!
Hunter!

403
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:59,156
亨特!
Hunter!

404
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,237
你这混蛋,你差点杀了我.
You stupid son of a bitch,
you could've killed me.

405
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:09,557
- 你说的做点什么.
- You said do something.
- 非这样做吗,该死.
- Do something else. Shit.

406
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:13,389
- 你这人怎么回事儿?
- What's wrong with you?
- 趁你发疯前我最好离开.
- I'd better leave before you get mad.

407
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:17,434
好吧.滚吧.
Right. There.

408
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,073
见鬼去吧,牛仔.
See you later, cowboy.

409
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,318
讨厌.
Creep.

410
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,514
妈妈,我不想走,我想跟你和爸爸在一起.
Mommy, I don't wanna go.
I wanna stay with you and daddy.

411
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:41,838
这里不安全了.你得远离这里躲到乡下去.
It's not safe here any more. You're better
off in the country away from everything.

412
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:44,952
- 妈妈.
- Mommy.
- 我们很快会重聚的.
- We'll all be together again soon.

413
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:48,357
- 我爱你,宝贝.
- I love you, precious.
- 再见,亲爱的.
- Bye, darling.

418
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:21,319
(广播)一所消防站遭到轰炸并引发了一场小规模种族冲突…
(radio) A firebombing in a fire station
has touched off a small race war...

439
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:58,828
你们丢东西了! 
Did you lose this?

440
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:03,275
恭喜你解决了尼克.
Congratulations on taking Nikko out.

441
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:08,554
那也救不了这些孩子,是吗?
Didn't help these kids, did it?

442
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:21,350
我阻止一个,冒出来一百个.
For every one I stop, a hundred succeed.

443
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:23,869
你无法阻止所有的.
You can't stop it all.

444
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:27,229
罗斯塔夫可以.
Rostov can.

445
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,238
你得找到他.
If you can find him.

446
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,590
我会找到他.
I'll find him.

447
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,473
这些你帮我搞定.
Here's what I want you to do.

448
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:43,910
亨特,这是自杀,我不能这么做.局里也不会.
Hunter, this is suicidal. I can't do this.
The Agency will never go for it.

449
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:48,033
你知道这将会引发什么冲突吗?
Do you realize what kind of cooperation
this will take?

450
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:50,231
想想风险吧.
Think of the risks.

451
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:54,154
想想利害吧.
Think of the stakes.

452
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:11,909
杰米·埃利斯，在亚特兰大为您报道
Jamie Ellis, on assignment in Atlanta,
at the temporary headquarters

453
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:14,953
