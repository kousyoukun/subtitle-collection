1
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:39,006
- Move.
- Let's go, let's go.

2
00:01:58,401 --> 00:02:01,112
We did it, right?

3
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:04,991
Whoa. What the hell are you doing?

4
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:20,548
- G-Girl.
- It's G-Girl.

5
00:02:24,135 --> 00:02:26,095
Gun.

6
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:42,988
G-Girl. G-Girl. G-Girl. G-Girl.

7
00:02:55,042 --> 00:03:01,298
Wow. So if you could have any superpower,
what would it be?

8
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:04,384
The ability to blow myself.

9
00:03:05,636 --> 00:03:07,513
That's quite a visual.

10
00:03:07,596 --> 00:03:10,474
- But wouldn't it seem a little...
- Gay?

11
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:15,979
- No, not at all. Think about it.
- Yeah, really? It seems that way.

12
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:19,149
Dude, check her out. Wow.

13
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:23,278
What do we have here?
Kind of uptight librarian on the outside,

14
00:03:23,362 --> 00:03:25,572
ready to rumble on the inside.

15
00:03:25,656 --> 00:03:28,492
- Go ask her out.
- No. I'm not ready yet. I can't.

16
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,619
Matt, you're killing me.

17
00:03:30,702 --> 00:03:34,832
Your last insane girlfriend dumped you,
like, six months ago.

18
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:38,001
I would have ploughed my way
through half of SoHo by now.

19
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:40,879
That's cos you're soulless and shallow.

20
00:03:40,963 --> 00:03:42,965
It is a blessing.

21
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:45,759
Go over there. Talk to her. Do it.

22
00:03:45,843 --> 00:03:49,263
- Matt, say hi. Give me your bag. Come on.
- OK, OK.

23
00:03:49,346 --> 00:03:51,348
Yes.

24
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,059
All out. Be strong. Breathe.

25
00:03:55,144 --> 00:03:57,229
Eye of the tiger.

26
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,526
Hi.

27
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:07,823
Excuse me. I know I don't really know you,
but you look like a very interesting person,

28
00:04:07,906 --> 00:04:10,576
so at the risk of totally humiliating myself,

29
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:13,579
I thought perhaps sometime
I might buy you a cup...

30
00:04:13,662 --> 00:04:15,747
No.

31
00:04:25,884 --> 00:04:30,388
It doesn't have to be a cup of coffee. It could
be whatever you want. A cup of anything.

32
00:04:30,472 --> 00:04:32,807
Juice?

33
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:58,750
Somebody stop that guy.

34
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:11,721
That's right. You better run, asshole.

35
00:05:11,805 --> 00:05:17,227
Keep running, my man.
You don't want any of this. Keep running.

36
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:20,730
Yeah.

37
00:05:22,148 --> 00:05:24,484
- What did you call me?
- Shit.

38
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:26,653
What did you call me?

39
00:05:39,624 --> 00:05:41,709
Idiot.

40
00:05:43,586 --> 00:05:45,672
Come on. Get out of there.

41
00:05:45,755 --> 00:05:50,176
Let's go. I know you're in there.
Get out of there.

42
00:05:50,844 --> 00:05:52,929
Whoa.

43
00:06:01,563 --> 00:06:03,648
How about it, huh?

44
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:09,864
So how about that cup of coffee?
Or it could be something more substantial.

45
00:06:09,947 --> 00:06:13,200
- Like dinner?
- Yeah. That'd be great.

46
00:06:13,284 --> 00:06:15,286
- Matt Saunders.
- Jenny Johnson.

47
00:06:15,369 --> 00:06:19,874
Jenny Johnson. Wonderful name.
You got the whole alliteration thing going.

48
00:06:19,957 --> 00:06:22,585
I grew up with a guy named
Francis Freddie Friedman.

49
00:06:22,668 --> 00:06:27,548
A bit of a klepto, not the kind of guy you'd
want over if you had spare cash laying out.

50
00:06:27,631 --> 00:06:29,341
Yeah, right. Right.

51
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:32,261
So... may I get your number?

52
00:06:32,344 --> 00:06:37,183
I'm sorry. I don't give it out.
Privacy issues. I'll take yours, though.

53
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:39,810
- OK. Actually, I don't think I have a pen.
- I do.

54
00:06:39,894 --> 00:06:43,439
Thanks. Isn't this something women do
just to blow off losers?

55
00:06:43,522 --> 00:06:45,774
Yes, women do do that.

56
00:06:45,858 --> 00:06:48,986
But that's not how I blow off losers.

57
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:05,878
Saunders, heads up.

58
00:07:07,546 --> 00:07:10,925
- You have bad reflexes.
- You're a danger in the workplace.

59
00:07:11,008 --> 00:07:14,428
Do you have the bathroom layouts
for the Beijing presentation?

60
00:07:14,512 --> 00:07:19,266
- I'll take a look at those.
- I finished them up last night.

61
00:07:20,851 --> 00:07:23,354
- Hey, Hannah.
- Hey, Vaughn.

62
00:07:27,566 --> 00:07:29,401
- Looks good.
- Thank you.

63
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:31,695
What about... Is this OK?

64
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:35,199
It's a bit tight,
but I talked to the structural engineer...

65
00:07:35,282 --> 00:07:38,828
- How's your boyfriend? Isn't his name Rick?
- Steve. He's good.

66
00:07:38,911 --> 00:07:41,539
He just got back from Milan. Look at this.

67
00:07:41,622 --> 00:07:45,918
- Milan?
- Yes, his new Joe Boxer ad campaign.

68
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:49,713
Wow. He's buff. Are you into that?

69
00:07:49,797 --> 00:07:54,093
I would think this is more your style.
What do you think?

70
00:07:54,176 --> 00:07:59,474
Two months in a gym, a personal trainer and
the right steroids, I look like that or better.

71
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:02,727
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

72
00:08:05,313 --> 00:08:07,649
What are you doing?

73
00:08:07,732 --> 00:08:12,529
Hey, Carla. Nothing. Just reshelving
some reference material, trying to stay ahead.

74
00:08:12,612 --> 00:08:16,032
- You were staring at her butt.
- He was?

75
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:19,161
- No. No, I was not.
- Yes, he was.

76
00:08:19,244 --> 00:08:23,331
Hannah, as you know, we have
a zero-tolerance policy for this behaviour.

77
00:08:23,415 --> 00:08:26,668
I actually read that memo twice. I got it.

78
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:28,920
You should be familiar with this part.

79
00:08:29,004 --> 00:08:33,091
Would you like to file a grievance
at this time?

80
00:08:33,175 --> 00:08:35,760
I don't think so, Carla.

81
00:08:35,844 --> 00:08:40,640
Because, as your supervisor, I am officially
giving you that opportunity right now.

82
00:08:40,724 --> 00:08:45,937
And I thank you for that,
but I think I'm just gonna let this one slide.

83
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:48,648
That's completely your decision.

84
00:08:48,732 --> 00:08:53,403
- Will you sign a statement to that effect?
- Sure. Yes.

85
00:08:54,738 --> 00:08:59,201
- You are lucky this time, Mr Bottom Watcher.
- OK.

86
00:09:00,577 --> 00:09:04,581
- Hello?
- Matt? Hey. It's Jenny Johnson.

87
00:09:04,664 --> 00:09:09,169
- Hey, Jenny. I wasn't sure I'd hear from you.
- So are we still on for dinner?

88
00:09:09,252 --> 00:09:13,423
- Dinner? Absolutely. That sounds great.
- Is that a girl? A real, live girl?

89
00:09:13,507 --> 00:09:17,594
A great new Indian place on Madison
just opened up. Eight o'clock?

90
00:09:17,677 --> 00:09:20,680
Indian? Love it. I'll see you tomorrow night.

91
00:09:20,764 --> 00:09:22,808
OK. Great. See you. Bye.

92
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:26,353
Saunders, do you have a date?

93
00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:29,356
Got a date. And it's a hot one.

94
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:36,029
So the assistant curator job's
really perfect for me.

95
00:09:36,363 --> 00:09:40,700
I was an art history major in college.
It's the only thing I'm good at.

96
00:09:40,784 --> 00:09:45,539
At least, the only thing I'm good at
I can make any money off.

97
00:09:45,622 --> 00:09:49,919
- That sounded like I was talking about sex.
- No. No, it didn't.

98
00:09:50,002 --> 00:09:52,296
Believe me, I didn't mean sex.

99
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,591
- I mean, I am good at sex.
- I'm sure you are.

100
00:09:55,675 --> 00:09:58,010
- Now it sounds like I'm bragging.
- No, no.

101
00:09:58,094 --> 00:10:03,391
I think I'm good at sex.
I don't know, you decide.

102
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:06,018
Me?

103
00:10:06,102 --> 00:10:08,938
But not tonight. It's our first date.

104
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,025
Yeah.

105
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,487
So what do you do?

106
00:10:16,571 --> 00:10:20,158
I'm a project manager at a design firm.

107
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:25,121
We design and build private estates,
libraries, hotels, that sort of thing.

108
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:27,498
Yeah, right now, we're...

109
00:10:41,095 --> 00:10:44,765
- I'm sorry. Am I bothering you?
- What?

110
00:10:44,849 --> 00:10:47,435
No. No.

111
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:51,814
I was just trying to listen to something.

112
00:10:53,107 --> 00:10:55,485
I don't hear anything.

113
00:10:55,568 --> 00:10:58,404
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
I have to go to the bathroom.

114
00:10:58,488 --> 00:11:00,573
Sure.

115
00:11:20,343 --> 00:11:25,473
- Yo, how's it going?
- Well, she's a talker, yeah.

116
00:11:25,556 --> 00:11:29,936
- Only question is, will you sleep with her?
- That's the only question, huh?

117
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:34,607
Yes. I'm not just talking about your date
tonight. I am talking about life in general.

118
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:39,363
- That is the only question.
- What's going on there?

119
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:44,034
Some big fire at 73rd and Broadway.
Everything's burning.

120
00:11:44,117 --> 00:11:46,411
- Is anyone hurt?
- I don't know. Probably.

121
00:11:46,495 --> 00:11:48,622
It's blocking my way to the gym.

122
00:11:48,705 --> 00:11:52,543
My thoughts are with you
in this time of crisis.

123
00:11:54,211 --> 00:11:56,755
Wow. Oh, man.

124
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:02,136
- What's going on?
- It's G-Girl. She's doing her thing.

125
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:06,807
Are you serious? You lucky SOB.
I've never even seen her in person.

126
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,976
How does she look?

127
00:12:10,102 --> 00:12:12,187
She looks...

128
00:12:13,105 --> 00:12:17,109
- What?
- Blurry. But still pretty hot.

129
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:20,237
Yeah? What's she doing now?

130
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,742
She's spinning around
like one of those things that spins.

131
00:12:25,826 --> 00:12:28,704
Amazing. That's unbelievable.

132
00:12:28,787 --> 00:12:30,873
Yeah. It's so cool.

133
00:12:40,632 --> 00:12:45,053
Yes. That's it, show's over.
She put the fire out. Fantastic.

134
00:12:45,137 --> 00:12:50,309
G-Girl. G-Girl. G-Girl. G-Girl. G-Girl.

135
00:12:50,392 --> 00:12:52,561
OK.

136
00:12:52,644 --> 00:12:56,523
And she's gone.
Flew off into the sunset. Amazing.

137
00:12:56,607 --> 00:13:00,444
Unbelievable.
Why do you think they call her G-Girl?

138
00:13:00,527 --> 00:13:05,866
I don't know, like, "gorgeous" or "G-force"?
I'm not really sure.

139
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:08,285
What do you think about "good kisser"?

140
00:13:08,368 --> 00:13:11,205
I can't believe I missed that.
I'm eating Indian food.

141
00:13:11,288 --> 00:13:14,166
Wait, no, no. "Goddess woman".

142
00:13:14,249 --> 00:13:17,252
- What about "G-spot"?
- I gotta go. Bye.

143
00:13:20,422 --> 00:13:25,386
Huge line. Sorry.
It was a really, really long line.

144
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:30,016
- You got a little something on your chin.
- What?

145
00:13:30,099 --> 00:13:34,395
- I hate when that happens.
- When what happens?

146
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:36,564
Mystery smudges.

147
00:13:36,648 --> 00:13:41,444
- Gotta go to the bathroom.
- You didn't just go to the bathroom?

148
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,492
Are you keeping track? That's kind of creepy.

149
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:51,788
- She sounds like a nutcase.
- So you're saying she's perfect for me?

150
00:13:51,871 --> 00:13:54,165
Crazy women are attracted to you.

151
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:56,334
It's like you give off a scent.

152
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:58,503
You should do a background check on her.

153
00:13:58,586 --> 00:14:02,257
What do you think? Shall we
keep these walls brick or make it stucco?

154
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,552
- Did you kick the plug?
- I don't know.

155
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:09,722
- Let me handle this one.
- All right.

156
00:14:10,682 --> 00:14:13,768
- Don't do that.
- Don't do what? What are you talking about?

157
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:16,855
You mean this?

158
00:14:16,938 --> 00:14:22,527
Sexual harassment's a two-way street. Don't
think cos I'm a guy you can manhandle me.

159
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:26,406
- What the hell's going on here?
- Sorry, her...

160
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:27,240
Steve.

161
00:14:27,323 --> 00:14:30,118
Her computer had gone down.
I was plugging it back in.

162
00:14:30,201 --> 00:14:34,372
- I'm screwing with you. I'm not worried.
- None taken.

163
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:37,542
- I missed you.
- I missed you too.

164
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,003
- Not here.
- Sorry.

165
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:46,593
See, Saunders? You need to be with someone
who appreciates you, like Steve here.

166
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:51,222
Yeah. I'm looking for Mr Right.
Haven't found him yet, though. Not given up.

167
00:14:51,306 --> 00:14:57,854
- Steve Ballard. Nice to meet you.
- This is Matt. You've met him, like, five times.

168
00:14:57,937 --> 00:15:02,567
- Right, right. Sorry.
- It's OK. I'm a very forgettable person.

169
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,654
When I was growing up, I'd come down
to breakfast and Mom would scream,

170
00:15:06,738 --> 00:15:08,865
call the cops on me.

171
00:15:08,948 --> 00:15:11,910
- It's a joke, right? Yeah.
- Yeah.

172
00:15:11,993 --> 00:15:16,499
- It's a good one. Got me back.
- Baby, we should be going to lunch.

173
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:21,754
Saunders, that woman is trouble.
Do not call her.

174
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,513
- OK, we're done.
- What happened? We just started.

175
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,140
That's it. No. I got a twinge.

176
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,643
Dude, you should definitely call her back.

177
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,938
- Yeah? You think I should?
- Yeah.

178
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,358
Cos she's good to go.

179
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,820
And you haven't gone in six months.

180
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,659
Yes. Plus, what's the downside?

181
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:58,666
I don't know. She seems a little...
She's neurotic, you know. And distant.

182
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:03,170
That's good. That's a good thing.
Neurotic and distant is a very good thing.

183
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:06,715
Yeah, neurotic women are hellcats in bed.

184
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,887
Plus, if she's distant,
you're both in it for the same thing.

185
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,265
Coitus maximus.

186
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:20,855
There's no, "Could she be the one? I'm falling
hard for her" kind of crap to get in the way.

187
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,649
It' s just pure carnal nirvana.

188
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:27,945
- Your argument's repugnant and intriguing.
- That's kind of my thing.

189
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:47,006
- Hey.
- Hi. Wow. Thank you.

190
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,883
- You're welcome.
- A rose.

191
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,677
Different colour roses mean different things.

192
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,931
Red ones mean passion or love,
so this is great.

193
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,268
But I'm not saying I think
you're telling me that you love me.

194
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,645
I mean, it's absurdly early for that.

195
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,566
But you never know. Maybe someday.

196
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:07,486
Or never. No pressure.

197
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,239
Let me get us a cab. Taxi.

198
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,367
Taxi.

199
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:22,292
It's stopping.

200
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:29,049
Here we go.

201
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,301
You OK?

202
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,137
At least we got a ride.

203
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,848
Can we stop by the gallery?
We opened a new show.

204
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:40,644
Sounds great.
Thanks for stopping. Appreciate it.

205
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,776
Wow.

206
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:53,406
Wonder what she's looking at.

207
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:02,124
That's gotta hurt.

208
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,418
So what do you think?

209
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:09,589
It's interesting. And a little disturbing.

210
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:16,680
I know. It's surprising
how frightening things attract us.

211
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:23,019
Matt, I have to help people every day,
and nobody's ever helped me except you.

212
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,523
You're my hero.

213
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:44,416
I'm sorry. What is it? Tell me.

214
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:48,336
It's your tongue. You're using it all wrong.

215
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:54,093
- What are you talking about?
- You shouldn't stick it out like a dead fish.

216
00:18:54,177 --> 00:18:57,096
You're supposed to flick it a little.

217
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,516
I think that I was flicking it, wasn't I?
I was doing that.

218
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,227
- No. Not enough.
- Really?

219
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:06,731
I'm not used to having my tongue skills
critiqued like this, OK?

220
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:09,108
Maybe not to your face.

221
00:19:09,859 --> 00:19:11,944
Oh, man.

222
00:19:12,904 --> 00:19:14,989
Let me help you.

223
00:19:16,574 --> 00:19:19,202
Close your eyes.

224
00:19:20,828 --> 00:19:22,914
Now do what I do.

225
00:19:38,137 --> 00:19:43,184
So... this is my place.
I redesigned the space when I bought it.

226
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:45,061
- It's nice.
- Thank you.

227
00:19:45,144 --> 00:19:48,022
This is the dining room.
Doesn't get a lot of use.

228
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:50,775
- Well, I could help with that.
- OK.

229
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:54,237
This is my fish. That's Biggie Smalls.

230
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,489
Hi, Biggie.

231
00:19:56,572 --> 00:20:00,117
He's never met a woman before.

232
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:03,913
Well, he's about to get an eyeful.

233
00:20:11,254 --> 00:20:14,507
- Will you show me the rest of your place?
- OK.

234
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,260
I'll take you over to the kitchen.

235
00:20:17,343 --> 00:20:23,349
That's the refrigerator.
I can get you a juice, a beer.

236
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:26,060
I'll make you anything. Yeah.

237
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:32,984
I'm not thirsty either.

238
00:20:35,278 --> 00:20:38,865
- And this is the...
- Bed.

239
00:20:43,245 --> 00:20:45,539
That's a great sweater. Wow.

240
00:20:45,622 --> 00:20:50,085
What a blouse.
Let me help with those buttons.

241
00:20:53,505 --> 00:20:59,636
- I'm sorry. I need the...
- The bathroom? It's right there.

242
00:21:00,846 --> 00:21:03,307
She goes to the bathroom a lot.

243
00:21:21,617 --> 00:21:24,036
I'm ready.

244
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:28,040
That's what I call structural integrity.

245
00:21:28,123 --> 00:21:32,544
All right. You should have
been dressed like that all night.

246
00:21:32,628 --> 00:21:34,880
You look great.

247
00:21:36,173 --> 00:21:38,759
Let me help you with this.

248
00:21:41,845 --> 00:21:45,057
- I must be a little nervous.
- It's OK.

249
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,268
I got a closet full of 'em.
Let me handle this one, though.

250
00:21:48,352 --> 00:21:50,729
- Let's take care of these.
- OK.

251
00:21:54,608 --> 00:21:56,693
Thanks.

252
00:22:01,114 --> 00:22:05,327
Who'd have thought we'd have ended up
like this after that day on the subway?

253
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,871
Ain't life grand?

254
00:22:10,374 --> 00:22:12,459
- Matt?
- Yeah?

255
00:22:13,293 --> 00:22:15,796
Do you mind if I get on top?

256
00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:18,757
Trust me, it's better that way.

257
00:22:18,841 --> 00:22:20,926
10-4.

258
00:22:26,557 --> 00:22:28,350
Are you ready?

259
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,355
- OK.
- OK.

260
00:22:32,438 --> 00:22:34,732
Here we go.

261
00:22:41,197 --> 00:22:43,283
Wow.

262
00:22:50,206 --> 00:22:52,625
OK, I get it.

263
00:22:53,418 --> 00:22:55,670
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

264
00:23:03,928 --> 00:23:06,014
Oh, goddamn.

265
00:23:08,141 --> 00:23:10,477
OK, now I need a break.

266
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:24,824
I'm sorry. I'll get you a new one.

267
00:23:24,908 --> 00:23:28,787
- A bed or a penis?
- Both.

268
00:23:54,729 --> 00:24:00,026
There are three moments
I will remember until the day I die.

269
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:05,490
One, the look on my father's face
when I graduated from Harvard Law School.

270
00:24:05,573 --> 00:24:10,787
Two, helping a beached
mother whale give birth.

271
00:24:11,913 --> 00:24:14,582
And three,

272
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:19,922
you and me together, here, tonight.

273
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:23,801
Don't speak to me again, ever.

274
00:24:27,096 --> 00:24:29,765
- Oh, no.
- Water, please. Got a big night.

275
00:24:29,849 --> 00:24:31,559
No, no, no.

276
00:24:31,642 --> 00:24:36,313
Don't tell me. You have invaded the
female nation and spread your democracy.

277
00:24:36,397 --> 00:24:39,900
What can I say? She's completely
different than I thought she was.

278
00:24:39,984 --> 00:24:43,112
- Hot, though, right?
- Unbelievably hot.

279
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:47,366
I don't even know if I should tell you this.
I don't know if you can handle it.

280
00:24:47,449 --> 00:24:50,286
I can handle it. Please?

281
00:24:50,369 --> 00:24:53,998
- She broke my bed.
- Wow.

282
00:24:54,081 --> 00:24:56,375
Busted it to pieces.

283
00:24:56,459 --> 00:24:59,628
- And that's a good thing, right?
- Yeah. That's a good thing.

284
00:24:59,712 --> 00:25:03,132
- I'm gonna see her again today.
- What are you talking about?

285
00:25:03,215 --> 00:25:05,843
No. You have sex with her once
and then you move on.

286
00:25:05,926 --> 00:25:10,598
Not if you get on the greatest ever roller
coaster, you don't. You get back in that line.

287
00:25:10,681 --> 00:25:14,852
Get in line, ride two or three more times,
throw your hands in the air and scream.

288
00:25:14,935 --> 00:25:17,104
But soon you're gonna end up nauseous.

289
00:25:17,188 --> 00:25:19,190
Hey, guys.

290
00:25:19,273 --> 00:25:23,486
- How are you guys doing?
- Keep that safety bar clamped down.

291
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:27,865
OK, I think you are gonna like this.
I have a little present for you, Saunders.

292
00:25:27,948 --> 00:25:31,660
- Anything for me there?
- No. No, Vaughn.

293
00:25:31,744 --> 00:25:33,662
- You have nice ears.
- Thank you.

294
00:25:33,746 --> 00:25:36,540
- No lobes, though.
- An imperfection. We all got 'em.

295
00:25:36,624 --> 00:25:42,713
Not me. I downloaded some Chinese phrases
for you, for the presentation.

296
00:25:42,797 --> 00:25:45,841
- What do you think? Thought it might help.
- That's great.

297
00:25:45,925 --> 00:25:48,969
- I thought it would help.
- You're the best, you know that?

298
00:25:49,053 --> 00:25:50,554
I know. I am.

299
00:25:50,638 --> 00:25:53,432
Well, I gotta get going.
I'm going to see Jenny.

300
00:25:53,516 --> 00:25:57,144
- You're seeing Jenny? Again?
- Yeah. Yeah.

301
00:25:57,228 --> 00:26:00,648
- Things must really be going well.
- She broke his bed.

302
00:26:00,731 --> 00:26:04,276
Thanks. That was really thoughtful of you.

303
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,403
- I'll see you two later.
- No problem.

304
00:26:06,487 --> 00:26:08,532
- See you, Matt.
- Look after her, OK?

305
00:26:08,615 --> 00:26:10,534
I will.

306
00:26:10,617 --> 00:26:15,163
- Man, he's seeing Jenny again?
- Just a few more times.

307
00:26:23,171 --> 00:26:29,010
- Matt Saunders? We're gonna take a ride.
- Wait a second. Wait.

308
00:26:33,056 --> 00:26:37,936
Now, look.
I don't appreciate being manhandled...

309
00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:40,313
What's going on?

310
00:26:41,273 --> 00:26:46,403
- Mr Saunders, thank you for your time.
- OK. Now, who are you?

311
00:26:46,486 --> 00:26:50,824
Who am I? Do you watch television,
Mr Saunders? Read the papers?

312
00:26:50,907 --> 00:26:54,244
- Use the net for anything other than porn?
- You're that Bedlam guy.

313
00:26:54,327 --> 00:26:57,289
- Professor Bedlam.
- The "supervillain".

314
00:26:57,372 --> 00:27:01,543
Please, I am not super, I am not a villain.
I'm just a regular man, like yourself,

315
00:27:01,626 --> 00:27:06,089
with 10,000 times more money,
intelligence and taste.

316
00:27:07,007 --> 00:27:10,051
OK, so what do you want from me?

317
00:27:10,135 --> 00:27:13,054
Are you seeing anyone, Mr Saunders?

318
00:27:13,889 --> 00:27:17,017
Are you asking me out?

319
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:22,564
I want you to tell me everything you know
about your new girlfriend.

320
00:27:22,647 --> 00:27:25,984
- Jenny?
- Yes. Jenny.

321
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:28,862
Where does she like to go?
What does she like to do?

322
00:27:28,945 --> 00:27:31,948
What music does she listen to?
Is she afraid of bugs?

323
00:27:32,032 --> 00:27:34,367
Is she a dog person or a cat person?

324
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:38,038
- Does she wear panties...
- OK, now, look. Hold on just a goddamn...

325
00:27:38,121 --> 00:27:42,667
Now, look.
It's gotta stop with the slapping, all right?

326
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:49,883
I just don't feel real comfortable telling you,
a total stranger, someone's private habits.

327
00:27:49,966 --> 00:27:52,677
You gotta understand that, right?

328
00:27:52,761 --> 00:27:54,596
Of course.

329
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:03,564
Please, someone. Help. Help.

330
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,191
Save me. Please.

331
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,956
Weasel.

332
00:28:30,091 --> 00:28:32,844
Help. Yeah, you. You.

333
00:28:32,927 --> 00:28:35,221
Get somebody from the Park Service.

334
00:28:35,304 --> 00:28:37,265
Oh, jeez.

335
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:40,351
No. Help me. Oh, no.

336
00:28:41,727 --> 00:28:43,771
Oh, my God.

337
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:55,783
- G-Girl. G-Girl, you saved me. Thank you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

338
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:58,077
- Hold me. Hold me.
- Don't look at me.

339
00:28:58,161 --> 00:29:00,371
- But I just wanted to...
- Don't look at me.

340
00:29:00,455 --> 00:29:03,166
OK, yeah. No looking. Got you. Roger.

341
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,884
Wow.

342
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:19,599
Looks like little Jenny's
been cashing in on her superpowers.

343
00:29:19,682 --> 00:29:23,644
Idiot. We don't want her to know
we dropped by.

344
00:29:37,325 --> 00:29:39,202
Perfect.

345
00:29:42,455 --> 00:29:45,500
So I'm falling,
I mean, hurdling through the sky.

346
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:48,712
And just as I'm about to bite it,
and I mean out of nowhere,

347
00:29:48,796 --> 00:29:52,299
she just catches me
and sets me right on the ground.

348
00:29:52,382 --> 00:29:55,219
It was unbelievable.
The weird thing is, though,

349
00:29:55,302 --> 00:29:58,013
that Bedlam guy,
he kept asking me about you.

350
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:00,766
- Do you know him?
- No, how could I know him?

351
00:30:00,849 --> 00:30:03,727
- That's what I was thinking.
- So what was she like?

352
00:30:03,811 --> 00:30:05,103
G-Girl?

353
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:09,817
I didn't really get a good look at her,
but to tell you the truth,

354
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,195
- she wasn't really what I expected, you know.
- In what way?

355
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:16,448
- I don't know. She just seemed a little...
- Brainy?

356
00:30:16,532 --> 00:30:19,618
- Not really.
- Exotic? Effervescent?

357
00:30:19,701 --> 00:30:22,246
No, I kind of got this vibe
she was a little nuts.

358
00:30:22,329 --> 00:30:26,125
Nuts? Maybe she was a little bit preoccupied,

359
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:28,669
having searched the entire city to save you

360
00:30:28,752 --> 00:30:32,965
from being squished like a bug
on a windshield.

361
00:30:33,048 --> 00:30:36,301
You girls all really stick together, don't you?

362
00:30:36,385 --> 00:30:38,887
I like it. You're like one big gang.

363
00:30:47,771 --> 00:30:51,692
- Rule number one about crossing the street?
- Look both ways.

364
00:30:51,775 --> 00:30:53,777
That's right.

365
00:30:54,736 --> 00:30:56,864
Jenny.

366
00:30:59,867 --> 00:31:04,788
- One of you call 911.
- I'm fine. I'm fine. That was close.

367
00:31:04,872 --> 00:31:06,582
I'm fine, I'm fine.

368
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:10,794
- You're not fine. How can you be fine?
- Look, Matt, I can walk.

369
00:31:10,878 --> 00:31:14,548
Don't move. You probably have
internal bleeding and don't know it.

370
00:31:14,631 --> 00:31:16,925
- No, not even a scratch.
- You are in shock.

371
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:21,472
Did anyone see this? It's like a miracle.
Truly, it's like a miracle.

372
00:31:23,765 --> 00:31:28,562
I mean, are you sure that you're OK?
I mean, you seem to be walking fine.

373
00:31:28,645 --> 00:31:30,606
Yeah.

374
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,943
This is the first time
that I've ever brought anybody here.

375
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:37,155
- Ever.
- Really? Wow.

376
00:31:37,489 --> 00:31:41,493
Yeah, it seems like a really great place.

377
00:31:41,576 --> 00:31:45,371
I'm still just kind of wondering
what the hell happened out there.

378
00:31:45,455 --> 00:31:47,373
I know.

379
00:31:47,457 --> 00:31:52,378
I didn't expect to do this.
At least, not yet anyway.

380
00:31:52,462 --> 00:31:56,633
- But it's good. It's good.
- OK.

381
00:31:56,716 --> 00:32:00,804
Cos what we have is so very, very special.

382
00:32:01,971 --> 00:32:04,057
- I trust you.
- OK.

383
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,101
There should be nothing hanging between us.

384
00:32:07,185 --> 00:32:10,230
Especially not this, don't you think?

385
00:32:11,231 --> 00:32:14,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

386
00:32:14,484 --> 00:32:17,654
I'll have to show you.

387
00:32:30,542 --> 00:32:35,797
You look nice without your glasses.
You look good with them too.

388
00:32:36,965 --> 00:32:39,300
I'll hold them for you.

389
00:32:40,802 --> 00:32:41,719
OK...

390
00:32:41,803 --> 00:32:45,974
I don't know what the explanation is,
but I like it already.

391
00:32:46,057 --> 00:32:52,147
Unless it's one of those Crying Game things?
It's not that, is it? I mean, I'm from Denver.

392
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,691
Just wait.

393
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:01,197
You got a G-Girl costume on.
That's...

394
00:33:01,281 --> 00:33:04,075
Kind of went all out, didn't you?

395
00:33:07,579 --> 00:33:09,747
And you even dyed your...

396
00:33:15,879 --> 00:33:17,964
Wow.

397
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:22,135
Are you kidding me?

398
00:33:23,678 --> 00:33:28,058
Oh, man. This is incredible.

399
00:33:28,142 --> 00:33:31,270
- But you can't tell anyone.
- Yeah, nobody except Vaughn.

400
00:33:31,353 --> 00:33:34,982
He slept with a Victoria's Secret model,
I've never heard the end of it.

401
00:33:35,065 --> 00:33:37,735
- This will blow that out of the water.
- No. Nobody.

402
00:33:37,818 --> 00:33:41,071
Matt, you have to promise me
you'll never, ever tell anyone.

403
00:33:41,155 --> 00:33:46,202
- Fine, you got it.
- No matter what, you will never tell anyone.

404
00:33:46,285 --> 00:33:48,412
I swear.

405
00:33:48,496 --> 00:33:52,708
Say you'd rather have a chain saw
shoved up your ass than tell.

406
00:33:52,792 --> 00:33:55,127
- Is that actually a possibility?
- Say it.

407
00:33:55,211 --> 00:33:59,298
I'd rather have a chain saw
shoved up my ass than tell.

408
00:33:59,381 --> 00:34:01,008
OK.

409
00:34:01,091 --> 00:34:05,221
So this Bedlam guy, he's like
your arch nemesis or something?

410
00:34:05,304 --> 00:34:09,391
He's been a pain in the butt ever since
we had this falling out in high school.

411
00:34:09,475 --> 00:34:11,811
You guys went to school together?

412
00:34:11,894 --> 00:34:13,354
Wow.

413
00:34:13,437 --> 00:34:16,398
By the way, his name's not really Bedlam.

414
00:34:16,482 --> 00:34:21,278
It's Barry. Barry Edward Lambert.
Bedlam, get it?

415
00:34:23,364 --> 00:34:27,493
Back then, we were both kind of outcasts.
Everybody else hated us.

416
00:34:27,576 --> 00:34:30,579
Nerd alert. Here come the geeks.

417
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:36,502
So we looked out for each other.

418
00:34:36,585 --> 00:34:41,257
It's only natural
that we spent a lot of time together.

419
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,639
We really liked each other.

420
00:34:49,181 --> 00:34:51,350
It was close to the end of our junior year

421
00:34:51,433 --> 00:34:55,271
when I decided it was about time
to get the virginity thing over with.

422
00:34:55,354 --> 00:34:58,107
I mean, Barry was harmless enough.

423
00:34:59,108 --> 00:35:02,278
I figured it might as well be him, right?

424
00:35:03,237 --> 00:35:06,574
He was having some trouble
getting his pants off.

425
00:35:06,657 --> 00:35:09,160
And that's when it happened.

426
00:35:10,494 --> 00:35:11,996
Jenny.

427
00:35:20,964 --> 00:35:22,132
Come on.

428
00:35:22,883 --> 00:35:25,677
This is not how I planned this evening.

429
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,096
My God. Look at that.

430
00:35:34,644 --> 00:35:37,230
It's so cool.

431
00:35:38,523 --> 00:35:42,861
- What are you doing?
- Isn't it amazing?

432
00:35:42,944 --> 00:35:45,071
Don't. It could be dangerous.

433
00:36:54,349 --> 00:36:57,185
When I got back to school, even with a wig,

434
00:36:57,269 --> 00:37:00,397
people noticed
there was something different about me.

435
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,025
Hi, girls. My glasses.

436
00:37:03,109 --> 00:37:05,611
And it worked for me.

437
00:37:07,738 --> 00:37:09,949
Hey.

438
00:37:12,952 --> 00:37:17,039
Unfortunately, Barry and I grew apart.

439
00:37:17,123 --> 00:37:19,417
He stopped talking to me.

440
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,003
And then ignored me totally.

441
00:37:22,962 --> 00:37:26,466
Anyway, things got worse between us
after I graduated.

442
00:37:26,549 --> 00:37:28,843
I committed to being a full-time superhero

443
00:37:28,926 --> 00:37:33,014
and he fell into the evil mastermind business,
yada-yada-yada. That's my story.

444
00:37:33,097 --> 00:37:34,474
Wow.

445
00:37:34,557 --> 00:37:38,227
And this whole time,
I just had this weird feeling

446
00:37:38,311 --> 00:37:43,024
that there was just something
a little off about you.

447
00:37:43,107 --> 00:37:47,820
- Really?
- You just had a secret, that's all.

448
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:51,908
- A supersecret.
- Now we both do.

449
00:37:51,991 --> 00:37:55,328
- May I ask you something?
- What?

450
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:01,459
I just think it could
maybe be a fun thing to try.

451
00:38:01,542 --> 00:38:04,170
It's kind of a request.

452
00:38:10,051 --> 00:38:12,136
Sure.

453
00:38:15,056 --> 00:38:17,767
- Be right back.
- OK.

454
00:38:28,277 --> 00:38:30,696
Is this what you had in mind?

455
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:34,116
Yeah. That's it.

456
00:38:40,331 --> 00:38:45,211
Matt Saunders,
you've been a very, very evil boy.

457
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:50,758
I think you need to be brought to justice.

458
00:38:50,842 --> 00:38:55,597
Yeah. I have been known
to bend a rule here and there.

459
00:38:55,681 --> 00:39:00,894
Total unrelenting justice.

460
00:39:04,231 --> 00:39:06,483
Wow. Shit.

461
00:39:08,277 --> 00:39:11,780
- Don't let go, all right?
- No.

462
00:39:11,864 --> 00:39:14,074
Yeah, you got me.

463
00:39:14,158 --> 00:39:16,243
Scared you.

464
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,874
Wow.

465
00:39:21,957 --> 00:39:24,501
Wow, we are high.

466
00:39:24,585 --> 00:39:27,629
- We are really, really high.
- Yeah.

467
00:39:27,713 --> 00:39:33,135
Jenny, you know, as fun as this is,
I'm feeling just a little bit emasculated here,

468
00:39:33,218 --> 00:39:37,431
with you kind of carrying me around
like a toy poodle. But don't let go.

469
00:39:37,514 --> 00:39:41,727
Careful. Where are you going?
Careful. Come on. Fly right.

470
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,896
Be careful.

471
00:39:44,855 --> 00:39:48,775
- I've always wanted to try this.
- Try what?

472
00:39:51,195 --> 00:39:55,741
That? Wow.
I'm not sure that's gonna work up here.

473
00:39:55,824 --> 00:39:57,910
It's draughty too.

474
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,246
What if I do this?

475
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:09,296
- You're not wearing any underwear.
- Yeah. I thought it might be easier that way.

476
00:40:14,301 --> 00:40:17,888
- Isn't this fun?
- It is fun. Yeah.

477
00:40:17,971 --> 00:40:21,433
Puts a whole new twist on the mile-high club.

478
00:40:22,518 --> 00:40:25,938
- Ready?
- Whoa. Not ready.

479
00:40:27,022 --> 00:40:29,399
- No.
- Just go with it.

480
00:40:29,483 --> 00:40:32,319
- Yeah, but...
- I know, I know. Don't stop. Yes.

481
00:40:32,402 --> 00:40:33,529
- No.
- Yes.

482
00:40:33,612 --> 00:40:35,697
- God, no.
- Yeah.

483
00:40:36,949 --> 00:40:39,034
Jenny.

484
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:41,913
Yes.

485
00:40:42,747 --> 00:40:44,332
Yes.

486
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:48,336
Don't ever do that again.

487
00:40:51,131 --> 00:40:54,676
G-Girl's hair before.

488
00:40:59,222 --> 00:41:01,766
Watch and learn.

489
00:41:16,573 --> 00:41:20,702
Her body is made
of the toughest substance known to man.

490
00:41:22,412 --> 00:41:24,497
But I know your secret.

491
00:41:43,892 --> 00:41:47,228
All right, now. G-Girl's hair after.

492
00:41:52,358 --> 00:41:54,569
Yes. Yes.

493
00:42:03,244 --> 00:42:06,372
- Saunders, what's wrong?
- I got a splinter in my finger.

494
00:42:06,456 --> 00:42:09,959
- Let me see.
- It's no big deal. I can get it out, I just need...

495
00:42:10,043 --> 00:42:12,796
- Come here. I'm good at this.
- What are you gonna do?

496
00:42:12,879 --> 00:42:14,964
Hold on.

497
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:27,227
- How did you do that?
- Well, I have my ways.

498
00:42:28,186 --> 00:42:30,564
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

499
00:42:33,526 --> 00:42:35,486
Jenny, what...

500
00:42:35,569 --> 00:42:37,822
What are you doing in New Jersey?

501
00:42:37,905 --> 00:42:40,783
I called your office
and found out where you were.

502
00:42:40,866 --> 00:42:43,577
I thought I would surprise you.

503
00:42:44,745 --> 00:42:49,208
- Are you surprised?
- I am surprised. I wanted to...

504
00:42:53,379 --> 00:42:56,715
Thanks. Good to see you.
Let me introduce you to Hannah Lewis.

505
00:42:56,799 --> 00:43:00,511
- This is Jenny Johnson.
- Hi. It's really nice to finally meet you.

506
00:43:00,594 --> 00:43:03,180
- Saunders talks about you all the time.
- I do.

507
00:43:03,264 --> 00:43:05,724
- I feel like I already know you.
- Really?

508
00:43:05,808 --> 00:43:08,769
Cos I feel like I'm just getting to know you.

509
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:12,189
OK. Got an idea.

510
00:43:12,273 --> 00:43:16,360
Hannah and her boyfriend Steve, I was
thinking, maybe we go out this weekend,

511
00:43:16,443 --> 00:43:20,865
just the two couples, two happy couples,
hit the town? What do you say?

512
00:43:20,948 --> 00:43:22,658
- Great.
- Great.

513
00:43:22,741 --> 00:43:23,868
Great.

514
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:32,918
OK.

515
00:43:33,002 --> 00:43:35,087
Bye.

516
00:43:38,591 --> 00:43:42,928
I'm sorry, guys. I have some bad news.

517
00:43:43,012 --> 00:43:47,892
- You got a little something right there.
- Thank you.

518
00:43:47,975 --> 00:43:51,395
Steve can't make it.
He had an emergency thong shoot.

519
00:43:51,479 --> 00:43:54,732
- A thong shoot emergency?
- Yeah, well, you know,

520
00:43:54,815 --> 00:43:56,859
one bad wedgie can be fatal.

521
00:43:56,942 --> 00:43:58,319
Yeah.

522
00:44:01,489 --> 00:44:04,283
Where's our stupid waiter? Sir.

523
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:07,328
Hold on. Something's going on.

524
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:10,122
The Pentagon has confirmed
an errant test missile

525
00:44:10,206 --> 00:44:13,417
is in fact on a direct course
for the tristate area.

526
00:44:13,501 --> 00:44:17,880
So far, all attempts to detonate or intercept
the missile have been unsuccessful.

527
00:44:17,963 --> 00:44:19,758
Great. Perfect.

528
00:44:19,841 --> 00:44:25,388
If it strikes within the city,
the death toll could reach into the thousands.

529
00:44:25,472 --> 00:44:28,266
- That does not sound good.
- Yeah, it sounds serious.

530
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:31,603
Maybe somebody should do something.

531
00:44:32,312 --> 00:44:35,899
Yeah, like the air force.
It's their job, right?

532
00:44:35,982 --> 00:44:40,111
So, Hannah, how long
have you and Matty known each other?

533
00:44:40,195 --> 00:44:44,950
Well, we started working together at Cockrum
about three years ago.

534
00:44:45,033 --> 00:44:48,954
We're getting reports of sporadic
looting from the Bronx to Staten Island.

535
00:44:49,037 --> 00:44:54,376
The government has urged people
not to panic and to stay in their homes.

536
00:44:57,379 --> 00:45:01,466
Gnocchi. Gnocchi sounds good.
Anyone want to share a gnocchi?

537
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:04,636
I'm sorry, but what if
the air force can't stop it?

538
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:07,931
Somebody else might need to step in.

539
00:45:08,014 --> 00:45:11,059
Maybe somebody deserves one night out

540
00:45:11,143 --> 00:45:13,895
without having to deal
with some impending disaster.

541
00:45:13,979 --> 00:45:17,107
I think someone has earned it. Don't you?

542
00:45:21,736 --> 00:45:24,114
Are you on a diet?
What are you gonna order?

543
00:45:24,197 --> 00:45:28,702
I don't know. I mean, shouldn't
we be leaving? Is this safe here?

544
00:45:28,785 --> 00:45:32,372
Sir. Can we get some service here?
I mean, I'm filling up on baguette.

545
00:45:32,456 --> 00:45:35,667
I think everybody's preoccupied
with what's happening.

546
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:38,753
Maybe if someone
could just take care of the problem,

547
00:45:38,837 --> 00:45:42,591
everyone can have a better night,
a smoother night, know what I mean?

548
00:45:42,674 --> 00:45:45,969
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Yeah, I'd appreciate it.

549
00:45:46,052 --> 00:45:49,222
In fact, I'd superappreciate it.

550
00:45:54,603 --> 00:45:56,688
All right. Fine.

551
00:46:06,615 --> 00:46:08,701
Is she OK? Where is she going?

552
00:46:08,784 --> 00:46:12,246
She's fine. She gets stressed.
I have her looping around the block.

553
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:17,752
Too late for a mass evacuation, the situation
is dangerous and potentially catastrophic.

554
00:46:17,835 --> 00:46:24,217
But all the citizens of New York can do
is sit, wait and pray for a miracle.

555
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:30,640
We're now getting a live picture of the missile
as it approaches the city.

556
00:46:31,891 --> 00:46:35,394
It appears certain that... Wait, what is that?

557
00:46:37,271 --> 00:46:40,358
It is G-Girl.

558
00:46:40,441 --> 00:46:45,571
- She is approaching the errant missile.
- Love that girl.

559
00:46:46,823 --> 00:46:48,366
My God.

560
00:46:48,449 --> 00:46:50,952
She just kicked it.

561
00:46:51,035 --> 00:46:55,414
She just deflected the missile
away from the city.

562
00:46:57,416 --> 00:46:59,877
We're safe. We are safe.

563
00:47:11,764 --> 00:47:14,767
G-Girl. G-Girl. G-Girl.

564
00:47:28,614 --> 00:47:34,745
You know, Matt, there are some things
I don't need infravision to see through.

565
00:47:36,038 --> 00:47:38,875
Sorry, what are you talking about?

566
00:47:38,958 --> 00:47:42,503
You and that slut from your office - Hannah.

567
00:47:42,587 --> 00:47:47,049
She is not a slut.
That is a terrible thing to say, Jenny.

568
00:47:49,051 --> 00:47:53,848
- You want to screw her, don't you?
- No. No, I do not.

569
00:47:53,931 --> 00:47:55,766
I don't believe you.

570
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:57,936
Can I say something?

571
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:01,106
Her boyfriend's a male model, OK? A model.

572
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:04,109
I don't think she'd be very interested
in a guy like me.

573
00:48:04,193 --> 00:48:05,986
I see your point.

574
00:48:06,069 --> 00:48:10,699
So you want to screw her, you just can't,
because she's got a boyfriend.

575
00:48:10,782 --> 00:48:15,287
No, I'm just saying that we're friends
who work together. We're work friends.

576
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:18,248
Don't lie to me.

577
00:48:21,919 --> 00:48:26,715
- What the hell did you do that for?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

578
00:48:26,799 --> 00:48:29,885
I'll pay for that, I swear.

579
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:36,391
OK, don't do that.

580
00:48:36,475 --> 00:48:39,436
Don't cry, OK? It'll be OK.

581
00:48:40,437 --> 00:48:44,066
I know I get a little crazy sometimes.

582
00:48:44,149 --> 00:48:46,235
It's just...

583
00:48:48,028 --> 00:48:50,531
I love you so much.

584
00:48:55,536 --> 00:48:57,830
OK... OK...

585
00:49:11,635 --> 00:49:15,055
- Hey.
- Hey. How's it going?

586
00:49:16,056 --> 00:49:18,058
Sorry.

587
00:49:18,142 --> 00:49:22,146
Look at her. She's like a cheerleader
from Spank Me University.

588
00:49:24,231 --> 00:49:28,152
Dude, what's wrong?
You look like shit.

589
00:49:28,235 --> 00:49:32,239
Let's go with the lighter weight today,
shall we?

590
00:49:32,322 --> 00:49:37,077
I'm actually thinking that
my first impression of Jenny was accurate.

591
00:49:37,161 --> 00:49:41,874
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, complete emotional basket case.

592
00:49:42,916 --> 00:49:45,461
- Needy, jealous...
- Jealous.

593
00:49:45,544 --> 00:49:48,756
...control...
- Controlling. A trifecta. Perfect.

594
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,759
The truth is, I don't even love her.

595
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:56,848
I'm in love with somebody else.

596
00:49:56,931 --> 00:49:59,184
You're in love with somebody else? Who?

597
00:49:59,267 --> 00:50:01,686
Is it me? Oh, my God, it's me, isn't it?

598
00:50:01,769 --> 00:50:04,564
I feel the same way. I totally...

599
00:50:06,608 --> 00:50:09,486
That's not a good sign, is it?

600
00:50:09,569 --> 00:50:13,323
- Who are you talking about?
- I don't wanna say. Not until I've told her.

601
00:50:13,406 --> 00:50:16,075
But, I mean, first I have
to break it off with Jenny.

602
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:19,787
- God knows how I'm gonna do that.
- OK, come with me. Listen.

603
00:50:19,871 --> 00:50:24,000
There are only two ways to successfully
break it off with a woman.

604
00:50:24,083 --> 00:50:26,753
You can either be a jerk or a weenie.

605
00:50:26,836 --> 00:50:32,467
Now, the jerk route is simple. You're like,
"Babe, listen up. I'm dumping your ass."

606
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:35,512
Just like that. It's quick, it's easy, it's painless.

607
00:50:35,595 --> 00:50:39,682
- I don't think you have the balls for it.
- Well, what's the weenie route?

608
00:50:39,766 --> 00:50:42,894
OK, good. Weenie route. Let's go with that.

609
00:50:42,977 --> 00:50:46,439
Sit real close, keep it romantic, OK?

610
00:50:46,523 --> 00:50:52,237
Keep a kind of a sparkle in the eye,
take her hand. Give me your hand.

611
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,823
You say, "Sweetheart,

612
00:50:54,906 --> 00:51:00,495
I think we need to take a little time off
from the relationship to re-evaluate things."

613
00:51:00,578 --> 00:51:03,164
Don't return any of her calls
for a year and a half.

614
00:51:03,248 --> 00:51:06,459
Pretty soon she'll give up
and you'll be in the clear.

615
00:51:06,543 --> 00:51:08,795
I can't believe I actually listen to you.

616
00:51:08,878 --> 00:51:12,298
Another thing. Make sure you do it
after you've had sex with her.

617
00:51:12,382 --> 00:51:15,135
It's really difficult the other way around.

618
00:51:26,604 --> 00:51:31,276
I was thinking, maybe we should
take a little time to...

619
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:34,070
re-examine where this is going.

620
00:51:38,576 --> 00:51:40,661
My God.

621
00:51:41,871 --> 00:51:44,498
Are you breaking up with me?

622
00:51:45,749 --> 00:51:48,669
No. No. Not at all.

623
00:51:50,421 --> 00:51:57,636
I mean, I just... I think it would be wise
to try and evaluate where we stand,

624
00:51:58,804 --> 00:52:01,640
just to make sure we're on the same page.

625
00:52:03,601 --> 00:52:09,273
So you're not saying that we should
start seeing other people or anything?

626
00:52:09,356 --> 00:52:11,859
No. No.

627
00:52:11,942 --> 00:52:14,528
No, I'm not saying that.

628
00:52:14,612 --> 00:52:18,282
OK, good. You scared me there for a second.

629
00:52:18,365 --> 00:52:25,539
Although seeing other people might
eventually be a part of the evaluation process.

630
00:52:31,754 --> 00:52:33,839
My God.

631
00:52:35,216 --> 00:52:37,051
You are breaking up with me.

632
00:52:37,134 --> 00:52:41,138
- Jenny, it's not you, OK?
- Shut up.

633
00:52:46,477 --> 00:52:50,481
I know exactly what it is.
It's that slut from your office, Hannah.

634
00:52:50,564 --> 00:52:53,067
- You're sleeping with her.
- I am not sleep...

635
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:56,946
- But you want to.
- Jenny, now, hold on a second, OK?

636
00:52:57,029 --> 00:52:59,698
You're such a liar.

637
00:52:59,782 --> 00:53:05,329
Look, I am not a liar, all right? You wanna
know the truth? It's not Hannah, OK? It's you.

638
00:53:05,412 --> 00:53:09,125
You're needy, jealous, manipulative.
I can't take it any more.

639
00:53:09,208 --> 00:53:12,336
- It's crazy.
- Don't call me crazy.

640
00:53:16,257 --> 00:53:21,345
See? That's the kind of thing I'm talking
about. I can't handle that on a daily basis.

641
00:53:21,428 --> 00:53:23,597
Well, handle this.

642
00:53:26,017 --> 00:53:29,020
What are you doing?

643
00:53:35,944 --> 00:53:38,989
You are so gonna regret this.

644
00:53:44,536 --> 00:53:46,621
Oh, man.

645
00:53:54,212 --> 00:53:56,089
- Wednesday? Thursday?
- No. No.

646
00:53:56,173 --> 00:53:59,426
Friday? Saturday? Sunday?
Brunch? In the day?

647
00:53:59,509 --> 00:54:01,595
Don't speak to me.

648
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:08,101
Look at it this way.

649
00:54:08,185 --> 00:54:10,520
The hard part is over.

650
00:54:10,604 --> 00:54:12,898
I don't know. She said I'd regret it.

651
00:54:13,523 --> 00:54:15,984
Don't worry about that. They always say that.

652
00:54:16,067 --> 00:54:17,903
Yeah?

653
00:54:17,986 --> 00:54:20,071
I guess you're right.

654
00:54:20,989 --> 00:54:26,953
You know, there's something that I've been
dying to tell you ever since I found it out.

655
00:54:27,037 --> 00:54:29,831
- Found out what?
- I just need you to promise me...

656
00:54:29,915 --> 00:54:32,959
- I promise.
- Hold on, let me finish, this is serious.

657
00:54:33,043 --> 00:54:39,299
- I need you to promise me that you're not...
- I promise. I won't tell anybody. Tell me.

658
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:42,969
You know Jenny?

659
00:54:45,138 --> 00:54:47,224
Yeah.

660
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:52,145
She's G-Girl.

661
00:54:59,486 --> 00:55:01,571
Bullshit.

662
00:55:02,322 --> 00:55:03,532
Bullshit.

663
00:55:03,615 --> 00:55:06,785
Apparently, this old dog
still has a few tricks left.

664
00:55:06,868 --> 00:55:09,996
My God, you have been doing G-Girl.

665
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,833
- I know. It's unbelievable. Me.
- Incredible.

666
00:55:12,917 --> 00:55:14,710
- I can't believe it.
- Knuckles.

667
00:55:14,794 --> 00:55:17,839
Imagine the heat I'll have
with the women when they find out.

668
00:55:17,922 --> 00:55:21,968
Wait. Whoa. Isn't she gonna mind
you revealing her secret identity?

669
00:55:22,051 --> 00:55:25,012
I warned you, Matt Saunders.

670
00:55:25,805 --> 00:55:27,557
No.

671
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:53,082
Watch it, dumb-ass.

672
00:56:08,097 --> 00:56:09,849
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

673
00:56:09,932 --> 00:56:13,102
What could be wrong?
Everything's great. Never better.

674
00:56:13,186 --> 00:56:15,229
Tell me.

675
00:56:16,147 --> 00:56:20,443
OK. I broke up with Jenny.

676
00:56:20,526 --> 00:56:25,281
You were right. I mean, she is
totally deranged, off-her-rocker crazy.

677
00:56:25,364 --> 00:56:28,659
I should have listened to you
from the beginning.

678
00:56:28,743 --> 00:56:31,871
Why don't you lay off
the crazy women for a while, huh?

679
00:56:31,954 --> 00:56:34,665
Come here. I'm sorry.

680
00:56:34,749 --> 00:56:36,834
Hannah.

681
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:41,547
There's been something that I've been
meaning to tell you for a long time.

682
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:43,716
Yes?

683
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,760
It's about you and...

684
00:56:50,515 --> 00:56:52,600
- Sorry. Are you OK?
- Out. Now.

685
00:56:52,683 --> 00:56:54,894
I'm going through a weird phase.

686
00:56:54,977 --> 00:56:57,438
- I saw that.
- What? No, it was nothing, Carla.

687
00:56:57,522 --> 00:57:00,149
Nothing? You knocked her down. You hit her.

688
00:57:00,233 --> 00:57:04,488
- Was there groping? Did he grope you?
- No, it was an accident.

689
00:57:04,571 --> 00:57:06,657
An accident? OK, like a fender-bender?

690
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:09,535
Here, we need to talk. Come here.

691
00:57:10,744 --> 00:57:15,374
Listen, my friend.
You are headed for some serious trouble.

692
00:57:15,457 --> 00:57:18,544
- Don't make excuses. That's the first mistake.
- OK.

693
00:57:18,627 --> 00:57:23,048
You have got to get your mind out of the
gutter long enough to nail this presentation.

694
00:57:23,132 --> 00:57:27,761
- I hear you, homegirl. I got it.
- What? What did you just call me?

695
00:57:27,845 --> 00:57:29,096
What? I don't know.

696
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:33,976
If the company doesn't get this project,
we're going to take a major hit.

697
00:57:34,059 --> 00:57:37,104
You really have a problem. Call my therapist.

698
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:39,064
OK, I'll call him... her.

699
00:57:39,148 --> 00:57:40,941
- Matt.
- What?

700
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:43,527
- Phone call.
- Oh, man.

701
00:57:45,737 --> 00:57:48,907
That boy has a major case of the hornies.

702
00:57:51,451 --> 00:57:52,995
Yeah?

703
00:57:53,078 --> 00:57:56,582
There's the young kid that zooms around
in here. Did he do something?

704
00:57:56,665 --> 00:58:00,502
- It's just up here.
- Looks like they broke in, fried the camera

705
00:58:00,586 --> 00:58:02,880
and then blew a huge hole
through the wall.

706
00:58:02,963 --> 00:58:06,341
- I've never seen nothing like it.
- Don't make no sense.

707
00:58:06,425 --> 00:58:09,344
We got a lot of nice cars -
his is the only one they took.

708
00:58:09,428 --> 00:58:11,138
Bitch.

709
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:17,186
Somebody went to a lot of trouble.
You know who could have done this?

710
00:58:17,269 --> 00:58:19,688
No. No, I don't.

711
00:58:19,771 --> 00:58:23,942
- Somebody with a grudge against you?
- Grudge? Against me?

712
00:58:25,402 --> 00:58:27,946
No. No, I don't. I'm sorry.

713
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:30,324
- We'll let you know if it turns up.
- OK.

714
00:58:30,407 --> 00:58:34,328
- Let's get to the paperwork.
- I wouldn't hold my breath on that, sir.

715
00:58:36,371 --> 00:58:39,958
Gentlemen...

716
00:58:40,042 --> 00:58:43,462
If you look closely, our model here...

717
00:58:43,545 --> 00:58:45,631
What the hell?

718
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:50,427
That's just great.

719
00:58:53,807 --> 00:58:56,726
Shit. I just got that fixed.

720
00:58:56,810 --> 00:59:02,524
Sorry, just came to use your telescope.
Nice and dark, isn't it?

721
00:59:02,607 --> 00:59:05,443
Wait a second. Is this all because of you?

722
00:59:05,527 --> 00:59:10,448
Yep, that'd be me. Yes.

723
00:59:10,532 --> 00:59:12,867
There we go.

724
00:59:12,951 --> 00:59:15,495
Come and have a look-see.

725
00:59:21,543 --> 00:59:22,627
I don't see any...

726
00:59:29,384 --> 00:59:33,138
- That's real mature.
- Save you a fortune in parking.

727
00:59:33,221 --> 00:59:37,475
Why are you doing this to me?
I mean, you're supposed to be the good guy.

728
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:41,563
I am the good guy. You are the bad guy.

729
00:59:41,646 --> 00:59:45,525
It's been a pleasure seeing you,
but I got a big day at the office tomorrow.

730
00:59:45,608 --> 00:59:49,612
I've got an important presentation to make,
so I need to get some sleep.

731
00:59:49,696 --> 00:59:54,909
I'm gonna have to say good night. You might
be the hottest girl I've ever gone out with,

732
00:59:54,993 --> 00:59:58,997
but you wanna know something?
You're the craziest, hands down.

733
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:01,374
Really?

734
01:00:21,519 --> 01:00:23,855
Dick?

735
01:00:27,901 --> 01:00:29,611
Will we begin soon?

736
01:00:29,694 --> 01:00:33,364
I'm so sorry you've been kept waiting.
I apologise. It's very rude.

737
01:00:33,448 --> 01:00:36,784
Just a few more minutes, please.

738
01:00:36,868 --> 01:00:40,331
- Hi. Excuse me, hi.
- Glad you could join us.

739
01:00:40,414 --> 01:00:43,125
Can you tell me why you're wearing a hat?

740
01:00:43,209 --> 01:00:46,712
- No.
- Why am I not surprised?

741
01:00:47,046 --> 01:00:49,465
- Hi. How are you?
- We can finally begin.

742
01:00:49,548 --> 01:00:52,134
- Gentlemen, I give you Matt Saunders.
- You OK?

743
01:00:52,218 --> 01:00:54,762
I'm fine. I'm fine.

744
01:00:54,845 --> 01:00:57,556
OK, gentlemen.

745
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:05,147
OK. Our design integrates
classic architectural ideas

746
01:01:05,231 --> 01:01:07,274
from the history of Chinese culture

747
01:01:07,358 --> 01:01:12,112
and transforms them
into a contemporary 21st century aesthetic.

748
01:01:12,196 --> 01:01:16,408
But you can see clearly
that functionality has not been sac...

749
01:01:19,954 --> 01:01:22,206
Sac...

750
01:01:23,624 --> 01:01:29,255
Sacrificed, as you can see here
by the multiple entrances to the central

751
01:01:29,338 --> 01:01:31,966
multipurpose courtyard area.

752
01:01:32,049 --> 01:01:34,468
Exactly. Exactly. Right.

753
01:01:34,552 --> 01:01:37,304
And with a total capacity for...

754
01:01:55,906 --> 01:01:59,368
You are one sick bastard.

755
01:02:04,039 --> 01:02:07,960
Oh, man. I am so, so sorry.

756
01:02:08,043 --> 01:02:10,129
Thanks.

757
01:02:11,088 --> 01:02:14,258
- You gotta laugh to keep from crying, right?
- Vaughn, shh.

758
01:02:14,341 --> 01:02:15,801
Sorry.

759
01:02:15,885 --> 01:02:19,638
Man, no woman's ever done that to me,
and I actually am a dick.

760
01:02:19,722 --> 01:02:25,019
OK, all done.
I am so sorry that you got fired.

761
01:02:25,102 --> 01:02:27,521
What happened in there?
Why did you...

762
01:02:27,605 --> 01:02:31,693
It's hard to explain.
Let's just say it's a good time for me to leave.

763
01:02:31,776 --> 01:02:36,031
- Where are you going?
- Don't know. Don't care.

764
01:02:36,114 --> 01:02:41,244
Look, if there's something wrong,
I'd like to help.

765
01:02:41,328 --> 01:02:48,251
Look, Hannah. Please just stay
as far away from me as possible, OK?

766
01:02:48,335 --> 01:02:51,630
If something were to happen to you
because of me,

767
01:02:51,713 --> 01:02:54,633
I wouldn't be able to live with myself.

768
01:03:13,652 --> 01:03:15,779
Damn.

769
01:03:19,366 --> 01:03:21,618
May we come in?

770
01:03:21,701 --> 01:03:23,787
Nice place.

771
01:03:28,917 --> 01:03:31,545
You broke her heart, didn't you?

772
01:03:31,628 --> 01:03:35,006
What do you need? Why are you here?
I'm in the middle of a project.

773
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:38,802
The same as you -
to get her out of my life for good.

774
01:03:38,885 --> 01:03:41,805
I want you to help me neutralise her.

775
01:03:41,888 --> 01:03:46,685
Whatever she's done to me,
I'm not gonna help you kill her.

776
01:03:46,768 --> 01:03:49,437
I didn't say "kill", I said "neutralise".

777
01:03:49,521 --> 01:03:52,858
It's a neutral word.
"Kill" is "kill". This is Switzerland.

778
01:03:52,941 --> 01:03:58,864
I have developed the means
of permanently stripping her of her powers.

779
01:04:00,031 --> 01:04:01,616
No powers?

780
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:07,122
So she'd just be another average,
everyday, run-of-the-mill, crazy ex-girlfriend?

781
01:04:07,205 --> 01:04:09,624
Yeah. That's gotta be better.

782
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:15,005
- So what would you want me to do?
- Draw her out into the open.

783
01:04:15,088 --> 01:04:18,342
Help me get her when her guard is down,
when she's vulnerable.

784
01:04:18,426 --> 01:04:23,181
Look, I don't mean to offend you,
but you have a reputation for doing things

785
01:04:23,264 --> 01:04:25,725
that most people would consider to be...

786
01:04:25,808 --> 01:04:27,560
No-nos?

787
01:04:27,643 --> 01:04:28,853
Yes.

788
01:04:28,936 --> 01:04:33,191
Yeah. Nothing to worry about. I'm retiring.

789
01:04:33,274 --> 01:04:35,526
- From supervillainy?
- Yeah.

790
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:39,947
That's good. Look, if you're going to retire,
why not just forget about her?

791
01:04:40,031 --> 01:04:42,617
That's what I'm gonna do.
I'm leaving town.

792
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:49,332
Because that woman, she just won't
leave me alone. She's obsessed with me.

793
01:04:49,415 --> 01:04:53,419
She has harassed me at every turn
and she never, ever stops.

794
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:59,926
So when you finally realise that she is not the
woman who is ever going to forget about you,

795
01:05:00,843 --> 01:05:03,763
- then you give me a call.
- OK.

796
01:05:03,846 --> 01:05:05,932
All right?

797
01:05:09,477 --> 01:05:12,814
Or you can email me
at "professorbedlam. Com".

798
01:05:12,897 --> 01:05:14,982
It's all one word.

799
01:05:17,985 --> 01:05:22,573
I think I'll just give running away a try.

800
01:05:29,121 --> 01:05:32,500
It's Matt. Please leave a message.

801
01:05:32,583 --> 01:05:37,004
Matt, it's Hannah.
Are you there? Please pick up.

802
01:05:37,088 --> 01:05:41,759
I need your help.
Something really bad's happened.

803
01:05:42,635 --> 01:05:46,681
- God, I guess you're not there. Bye.
- Hannah.

804
01:06:11,623 --> 01:06:15,377
- Who is it?
- It's me, Matt. Open up.

805
01:06:15,461 --> 01:06:19,506
Hannah. Are you OK?
What did she do to you? Is she here?

806
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:22,468
- Is who here?
- G-Girl.

807
01:06:22,551 --> 01:06:25,137
G-Girl? Like the superhero?

808
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:27,514
Yeah, G-Girl the super...

809
01:06:28,724 --> 01:06:30,809
Why did you call me?

810
01:06:32,644 --> 01:06:35,731
- Steve was cheating on me.
- Thank God.

811
01:06:35,814 --> 01:06:38,150
What?

812
01:06:38,901 --> 01:06:43,447
Thank God that you found out
sooner rather than later.

813
01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:45,282
I am sorry.

814
01:06:45,365 --> 01:06:49,244
Yeah, I caught him in bed
with another woman.

815
01:06:49,328 --> 01:06:51,997
Actually, two other women.

816
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:56,585
Maybe three.
I don't know - I didn't really get a good look.

817
01:06:56,668 --> 01:06:58,962
- Three?
- Yeah.

818
01:06:59,963 --> 01:07:00,756
Wow.

819
01:07:00,839 --> 01:07:06,303
Steve was so good-looking
and he loved jazz and rock-climbing.

820
01:07:06,386 --> 01:07:08,847
He took me to nice places
and gave me multiple...

821
01:07:08,931 --> 01:07:11,725
I don't really need to hear that.

822
01:07:17,189 --> 01:07:21,777
The thing is,
I never really had any fun with him.

823
01:07:23,237 --> 01:07:26,156
Not like I have with you.

824
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:30,494
You've been
a really good friend to me, Saunders.

825
01:07:33,121 --> 01:07:35,207
Hannah, the thing is,

826
01:07:36,667 --> 01:07:39,837
I don't wanna be just a friend any more.

827
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,214
- You don't?
- No.

828
01:07:43,465 --> 01:07:45,509
Look...

829
01:07:46,426 --> 01:07:50,973
Hannah, my life has been really crazy lately.

830
01:07:51,056 --> 01:07:54,143
But it has made me realise
what's most important to me.

831
01:07:54,226 --> 01:07:59,983
Seeing you at work every day, that was
always the thing I looked forward to the most.

832
01:08:00,066 --> 01:08:05,363
You're the smartest,
most beautiful girl that I've ever met.

833
01:08:07,323 --> 01:08:10,743
And I'm completely
and totally in love with you.

834
01:08:34,058 --> 01:08:38,313
That was great. Didn't hurt at all.

835
01:08:38,396 --> 01:08:45,320
I probably shouldn't tell you this,
but this might be the best moment of my life.

836
01:08:45,403 --> 01:08:48,990
That's not fair. I was gonna say that.

837
01:08:49,949 --> 01:08:52,035
Sweetie.

838
01:08:56,498 --> 01:08:57,874
Matt?

839
01:08:59,375 --> 01:09:02,128
I hate you, Matt Saunders.

840
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:06,257
Get down.

841
01:09:43,586 --> 01:09:46,841
Why did G-Girl throw a shark at us?

842
01:09:50,136 --> 01:09:52,596
I can't tell you.

843
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:55,850
And she was so pissed off.
Have you done something?

844
01:09:55,933 --> 01:09:58,477
- Are you in trouble?
- No. Well, yeah.

845
01:09:58,561 --> 01:10:00,855
And as long as I'm here, so are you.

846
01:10:00,938 --> 01:10:03,732
You gotta get outside the city.
Go someplace and hide.

847
01:10:03,816 --> 01:10:06,777
San Diego. Tahiti. Utah.

848
01:10:06,861 --> 01:10:09,405
No, not Utah, Utah sucks. Anywhere else.

849
01:10:09,488 --> 01:10:12,199
But you gotta go someplace,
lay low for a while.

850
01:10:12,283 --> 01:10:14,910
- I don't understand.
- Look.

851
01:10:14,994 --> 01:10:19,540
If I ever see you again,
this will all be over, OK?

852
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:22,751
If?

853
01:10:22,835 --> 01:10:24,920
Matt, wait.

854
01:10:57,786 --> 01:11:00,581
- It's you.
- Come in. Wait here.

855
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:04,627
- Right here? Where?
- What? Right here.

856
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:07,630
- OK.
- Over there.

857
01:11:22,353 --> 01:11:24,438
Wow.

858
01:11:33,614 --> 01:11:39,329
Look, I'm here cos I need your help, OK?
I just need to know how we're gonna stop her.

859
01:11:39,412 --> 01:11:45,293
I have spent the past ten years trying
to analyse the source of G-Girl's power.

860
01:11:45,377 --> 01:11:48,797
It is a unique type of radiation
that permeates every cell of her body.

861
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:53,885
Yeah, I know about the meteor in high school.
She told me. I know.

862
01:11:53,969 --> 01:11:56,054
- She told you that?
- Yeah.

863
01:11:57,097 --> 01:11:59,599
Did she talk about me?

864
01:11:59,683 --> 01:12:03,270
I mean, she said you guys were friends,
you had a falling out.

865
01:12:03,353 --> 01:12:07,774
Bullshit. That meteorite
changed everything between us.

866
01:12:07,858 --> 01:12:13,155
But now, I've got something
that will totally level the playing field.

867
01:12:17,284 --> 01:12:19,661
That?

868
01:12:19,744 --> 01:12:21,454
The rock?

869
01:12:21,538 --> 01:12:24,499
No, the ham. Yes, the rock.

870
01:12:26,251 --> 01:12:30,964
A special rock.
It was a rock that gave off the radiation.

871
01:12:31,047 --> 01:12:34,551
I now have a rock
that will absorb the radiation.

872
01:12:35,886 --> 01:12:38,513
So if you got Jenny
close enough to this thing...

873
01:12:38,597 --> 01:12:42,809
It'll draw the radiation from her body,
sucking it out of her like a sponge.

874
01:12:42,893 --> 01:12:46,480
Draining her of her powers permanently.

875
01:12:46,563 --> 01:12:50,817
OK, so what do you need me for?
Why can't you just get her close to it?

876
01:12:50,901 --> 01:12:53,653
With that superhearing of hers?

877
01:12:53,737 --> 01:12:57,282
No, I need someone who can lure her to it.

878
01:12:57,365 --> 01:13:00,076
Someone who she has no cause to fear.

879
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:03,163
A weak and powerless simpleton.

880
01:13:03,246 --> 01:13:05,332
An idiot.

881
01:13:20,305 --> 01:13:26,020
No, all of these invoices were returned.
None of them have been paid.

882
01:13:26,103 --> 01:13:28,564
Call back.

883
01:13:30,191 --> 01:13:33,736
And these two are supposed to be...

884
01:13:38,741 --> 01:13:40,827
Hi.

885
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:45,581
Hi.

886
01:13:45,665 --> 01:13:46,999
What's this?

887
01:13:47,083 --> 01:13:49,961
It's just a little something
I thought I'd bring by...

888
01:13:50,044 --> 01:13:51,796
- Flowers?
- Yeah.

889
01:13:51,879 --> 01:13:55,842
You think flowers
are going to make me forgive you?

890
01:13:55,925 --> 01:13:59,846
No. No, I do not think that.
I don't think that at all.

891
01:13:59,929 --> 01:14:03,266
Then what the hell are you doing here?

892
01:14:03,349 --> 01:14:10,231
OK, look. To be honest, I realise that
I've made the biggest mistake of my life.

893
01:14:10,314 --> 01:14:16,779
I'm desperately in love with you and I'd
do anything for us to be together again.

894
01:14:22,410 --> 01:14:24,495
I would.

895
01:14:33,838 --> 01:14:36,757
God, they're beautiful.

896
01:14:38,509 --> 01:14:40,178
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

897
01:14:40,261 --> 01:14:43,347
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

898
01:14:43,431 --> 01:14:49,270
What do you think about today after work
you come by my place around seven

899
01:14:49,353 --> 01:14:55,485
- and I'll make us a nice dinner?
- Seven? I'd love to.

900
01:15:23,013 --> 01:15:25,098
Matt?

901
01:15:26,099 --> 01:15:28,185
Matt?

902
01:15:31,605 --> 01:15:34,107
- My God.
- Hey, Jenny.

903
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,611
Matt, it's beautiful.

904
01:15:38,695 --> 01:15:40,781
What is that? Is that for me?

905
01:15:40,864 --> 01:15:44,493
It is. It's a little something I got you cos...

906
01:15:44,576 --> 01:15:48,080
I wanna apologise
for the terrible way that I've treated you.

907
01:15:48,163 --> 01:15:51,667
- It just wasn't right.
- You're so sweet. You didn't have to.

908
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:54,128
- It's true, I'm sorry.
- What is it?

909
01:15:54,211 --> 01:15:58,799
No peeking, OK? I want it
to be a surprise. Let's have a toast.

910
01:15:58,882 --> 01:16:01,552
You are amazing.

911
01:16:01,635 --> 01:16:04,638
To second chances.

912
01:16:05,681 --> 01:16:08,058
To second chances.

913
01:16:09,685 --> 01:16:14,273
The man's not bad.
He might have a future in our business.

914
01:16:14,815 --> 01:16:17,109
You know, deep down,

915
01:16:17,192 --> 01:16:21,905
I had a feeling that you'd realise
your mistake and come back to me.

916
01:16:21,989 --> 01:16:24,074
You are wise.

917
01:16:25,993 --> 01:16:28,996
- Do you wanna know a secret?
- Sure.

918
01:16:32,708 --> 01:16:35,335
That's why I didn't kill you.

919
01:16:59,985 --> 01:17:01,279
Matt?

920
01:17:01,362 --> 01:17:04,115
You are the sweetest guy I've ever met.

921
01:17:04,199 --> 01:17:07,243
- No, no, I'm not.
- Yes, yes, you are.

922
01:17:08,203 --> 01:17:10,830
You're sweet.

923
01:17:10,914 --> 01:17:12,999
Yummy.

924
01:17:14,292 --> 01:17:16,586
Matt?

925
01:17:16,669 --> 01:17:18,546
What are you doing here?

926
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:21,216
Me? What are you doing here?

927
01:17:21,299 --> 01:17:24,677
You said your life was in danger.
And what's she doing here?

928
01:17:24,761 --> 01:17:27,806
- Who's that? Do we know her?
- I don't know her.

929
01:17:27,889 --> 01:17:29,098
I don't know her.

930
01:17:29,182 --> 01:17:34,437
You know how you tried to steal my
boyfriend by being such a big, fat whore?

931
01:17:34,521 --> 01:17:37,148
- It didn't work.
- Jenny, stop. Let me handle this.

932
01:17:37,232 --> 01:17:38,691
- Are you back with her?
- No.

933
01:17:38,775 --> 01:17:40,860
- What?
- Yeah.

934
01:17:40,944 --> 01:17:44,030
Look, it's very complicated, OK?

935
01:17:44,113 --> 01:17:46,950
How could you do this?
You told me you loved me.

936
01:17:47,033 --> 01:17:49,994
Hannah, please, just do me a favour, OK?
Just leave.

937
01:17:50,078 --> 01:17:54,290
I mean, just try to have a little self-respect.
You're starting to look pathetic.

938
01:17:54,374 --> 01:18:00,130
Matt. You are not... My God. There you are.
Thank God. I've been calling you all day.

939
01:18:00,213 --> 01:18:02,924
Playoff tickets. Amazing seats. You and me.

940
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:05,718
- Not now.
- Tonight. Third base line.

941
01:18:05,802 --> 01:18:09,264
- Now is a terrible time, OK?
- What's in the box?

942
01:18:09,347 --> 01:18:14,018
- Stay away from that box.
- You know, Hannah,

943
01:18:14,102 --> 01:18:18,148
why don't you just run along before I have
to kick your ass back to Munchkin Land?

944
01:18:18,231 --> 01:18:21,276
- Stay away from it.
- It looks big, it might be a nice present.

945
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:25,321
- Are you threatening me?
- Push me one more time and you'll find out.

946
01:18:25,405 --> 01:18:29,701
Yeah? What are you going to do?
Squash me with your gigantic feet?

947
01:18:29,784 --> 01:18:32,620
- That's it.
- Don't touch me.

948
01:18:34,205 --> 01:18:38,501
Just do me a favour and leave
and take Hannah with you...

949
01:18:39,210 --> 01:18:42,672
- My God.
- My God. You're G-Girl.

950
01:18:43,256 --> 01:18:45,633
You have been doing G-Girl?

951
01:18:46,551 --> 01:18:50,639
- Vaughn, open the box.
- Go, go, go. Watch the van.

952
01:18:52,391 --> 01:18:54,560
Open the damn box.

953
01:18:58,314 --> 01:19:00,691
It's not much of a present.

954
01:19:01,859 --> 01:19:03,944
I'm sorry.

955
01:19:06,655 --> 01:19:08,741
You bastard.

956
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:20,586
Matt, that's a weird rock.

957
01:19:22,129 --> 01:19:26,258
A happy ending for everybody.
Well done, Mr Saunders.

958
01:19:26,342 --> 01:19:29,220
You did this? You helped him?

959
01:19:29,303 --> 01:19:33,808
I'm really sorry.
You did throw a shark at me, you know.

960
01:19:33,891 --> 01:19:37,728
Besides, Bedlam's gonna retire. It'll be OK.

961
01:19:38,729 --> 01:19:40,397
You idiot.

962
01:19:42,441 --> 01:19:45,778
Looks like you're done, honey.

963
01:19:45,861 --> 01:19:50,658
You always thought
you were so much better than me.

964
01:19:50,741 --> 01:19:52,618
Now it's my turn.

965
01:19:52,701 --> 01:19:55,996
Now I'll be the one with the powers.

966
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:59,291
You'll be just plain old Jenny Johnson.

967
01:20:00,251 --> 01:20:03,045
We're having a moment here.

968
01:20:04,713 --> 01:20:10,094
- Not so tough now, huh?
- Hannah, don't let her touch the rock.

969
01:20:23,566 --> 01:20:25,901
Hannah.

970
01:20:28,737 --> 01:20:30,197
No. Hannah.

971
01:20:31,991 --> 01:20:34,577
I can't even see her. We gotta get down there.

972
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:36,745
Oh, man.

973
01:20:37,705 --> 01:20:39,749
I think she's dead, Matt.

974
01:20:39,833 --> 01:20:42,627
- I'm sorry. Let her go.
- We gotta dig her out.

975
01:20:42,711 --> 01:20:46,089
- We gotta start the grieving process.
- Are you crazy?

976
01:20:46,173 --> 01:20:48,758
- Come here. Give me a hug, bear cub.
- You.

977
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:53,472
I thought you were just a jerk.

978
01:20:53,555 --> 01:20:55,932
Now I find out you're really stupid.

979
01:20:56,016 --> 01:20:58,268
Teaming up with Barry?

980
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:09,779
You broke my heart
and now I'm gonna break your everything.

981
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:18,497
Let go of my boyfriend, you crazy bitch.

982
01:21:19,456 --> 01:21:22,083
Bring it.

983
01:21:27,255 --> 01:21:29,466
Oh, man.

984
01:21:29,549 --> 01:21:32,010
Yes, girl fight.

985
01:21:32,761 --> 01:21:34,638
Stupid.

986
01:21:35,722 --> 01:21:37,766
Matt.

987
01:21:45,190 --> 01:21:47,275
No.

988
01:21:47,901 --> 01:21:49,736
Hannah.

989
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:51,446
Hannah, are you OK?

990
01:21:52,405 --> 01:21:54,032
No.

991
01:22:01,164 --> 01:22:03,333
You rat.

992
01:22:06,586 --> 01:22:11,174
Matt. Matt, Matt, are you OK?

993
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:38,202
Wow.

994
01:22:41,497 --> 01:22:43,875
Hannah, stop. Come on, stop.

995
01:22:43,958 --> 01:22:45,459
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

996
01:22:45,543 --> 01:22:48,754
I'm fine too. I thought I twinged my knee,
but I'm all right.

997
01:22:48,838 --> 01:22:52,592
Come on. Forget about them. Let's go.

998
01:22:52,675 --> 01:22:54,927
Come on.

999
01:22:57,138 --> 01:23:00,683
They're gonna kill each other. This way.

1000
01:23:03,728 --> 01:23:05,980
- It's you.
- Are you with them?

1001
01:23:06,063 --> 01:23:08,149
As a matter of fact, I am.

1002
01:23:09,233 --> 01:23:11,611
They went down there.

1003
01:23:29,921 --> 01:23:32,507
Stop.

1004
01:23:33,007 --> 01:23:37,053
Look at yourself.
You're terrifying these people.

1005
01:23:40,389 --> 01:23:44,977
Jenny... Jenny,
this has gotta stop right now, OK?

1006
01:23:45,061 --> 01:23:46,562
Please.

1007
01:23:46,646 --> 01:23:49,106
Just give me that, OK?

1008
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:51,734
There you go. Just give it to me.

1009
01:23:51,818 --> 01:23:55,613
Wow. That was a lot heavier than I thought.

1010
01:23:56,739 --> 01:23:58,866
Hi.

1011
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:03,788
Look, God knows
I don't want you mad at me, OK?

1012
01:24:03,871 --> 01:24:06,415
And I'm sorry if I ever hurt you.

1013
01:24:06,499 --> 01:24:10,586
And yeah, I know what we had
was something special.

1014
01:24:10,670 --> 01:24:13,005
And at times it was great.

1015
01:24:13,089 --> 01:24:18,178
But it wasn't love, all right?
And deep down, you know that.

1016
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:24,810
You're a great girl.
And you deserve to be with the perfect guy.

1017
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:26,645
- You do.
- I do.

1018
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:32,151
And I know who the perfect guy for you is.
And he's here, right here, right now.

1019
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:34,319
Professor.

1020
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:39,241
- What?
- Barry?

1021
01:24:40,117 --> 01:24:42,744
- Go on, Professor, tell her.
- Tell her what?

1022
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:45,706
She's my mortal enemy?
I want nothing but her destruction?

1023
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:50,961
- Come on, Barry, please.
- Please stop calling me Barry.

1024
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:54,840
It's true. This guy,
he's got a shrine to you in his house.

1025
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:58,677
There are pictures of you
all over the walls, just of you.

1026
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:02,264
This guy, he is hooked on you.
He really is.

1027
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:05,851
Is that true?

1028
01:25:11,857 --> 01:25:17,237
Come on. You gotta open your heart to her.
It's now or never.

1029
01:25:17,321 --> 01:25:20,199
It may be a little true.

1030
01:25:22,284 --> 01:25:27,247
OK, OK, that's a good start.
Come on, Barry. Barry, come on.

1031
01:25:27,331 --> 01:25:29,958
All right, all right.

1032
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:32,127
It's completely true.

1033
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:36,298
I love you.

1034
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:39,301
I've always loved you.

1035
01:25:39,384 --> 01:25:43,972
But if you love me so much, then how come
you're always trying to hurt me?

1036
01:25:44,056 --> 01:25:49,394
Because you hurt me. Because you
broke my heart into a billion pieces.

1037
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:52,356
You ignored me.

1038
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:54,525
You left me behind.

1039
01:25:56,527 --> 01:26:02,366
So I thought if I had the powers,
you may learn to love me

1040
01:26:02,449 --> 01:26:05,828
the way I have always loved you.

1041
01:26:10,124 --> 01:26:12,210
Are you sure?

1042
01:26:13,586 --> 01:26:15,797
Do you really love me?

1043
01:26:19,926 --> 01:26:22,178
Yeah.

1044
01:26:34,149 --> 01:26:37,193
It's over. Can you believe it?
I'm free. You were great.

1045
01:26:37,277 --> 01:26:38,820
I can't believe that fight.

1046
01:26:38,903 --> 01:26:41,990
I still think she'd kick my butt,
but I got a few good punches in.

1047
01:26:42,073 --> 01:26:45,160
You saved my ass in there.
You were wonderful.

1048
01:26:45,243 --> 01:26:48,413
And I'm really sorry
I didn't explain things to you sooner,

1049
01:26:48,496 --> 01:26:53,084
- but I was just trying to protect you.
- I totally understand.

1050
01:26:53,168 --> 01:26:54,294
Good.

1051
01:26:54,377 --> 01:26:58,423
- My God, my hair.
- It doesn't look that bad. You can fix it.

1052
01:26:58,506 --> 01:27:00,467
Here, try this on.

1053
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:02,427
Thanks.

1054
01:27:03,803 --> 01:27:06,347
See? Adorable.

1055
01:27:06,431 --> 01:27:08,725
- Yes, you are.
- No, not me.

1056
01:27:08,808 --> 01:27:11,603
Come here.

1057
01:27:11,686 --> 01:27:13,438
- Tight.
- I'm so sorry.

1058
01:27:13,521 --> 01:27:17,233
- It's OK.
- I'm still getting used to all of this.

1059
01:27:17,317 --> 01:27:23,323
You and me both. And you know, we're going
to have to talk about the relationship too.

1060
01:27:23,406 --> 01:27:27,285
- Talk? You mean...
- Your powers.

1061
01:27:27,368 --> 01:27:32,248
Just cos you have 'em doesn't mean
you have to use 'em, you know what I mean?

1062
01:27:32,332 --> 01:27:35,460
You're a little scared of me.

1063
01:27:35,543 --> 01:27:38,463
What? Scared?
No, come on, I'm not scared at all.

1064
01:27:38,546 --> 01:27:40,632
Come here.

1065
01:27:49,724 --> 01:27:51,601
Are you ready?

1066
01:27:51,684 --> 01:27:55,981
Yeah. I am. I'm ready.

1067
01:27:56,065 --> 01:27:58,692
OK. Here we go.

1068
01:28:03,239 --> 01:28:05,533
OK, all right, I got it.

1069
01:28:12,456 --> 01:28:17,086
- Hold on, I think I tweaked something.
- You poor baby.

1070
01:28:27,304 --> 01:28:29,431
What the hell were you doing?

1071
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:33,811
Sorry. Sorry.

1072
01:28:48,450 --> 01:28:52,121
I brought it down for you.
Peace offering.

1073
01:28:57,001 --> 01:29:00,087
You've done so much for us.
We couldn't be happier.

1074
01:29:00,171 --> 01:29:02,756
- How? How?
- Asteroids.

1075
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:06,218
Most of that will just buff right out.

1076
01:29:10,890 --> 01:29:13,601
- I'll fix that.
- I could trick it out for you.

1077
01:29:13,684 --> 01:29:18,397
Rocket launchers, laser cannons,
voice-activated battle armour.

1078
01:29:18,481 --> 01:29:20,566
- Do you hear something?
- No.

1079
01:29:20,649 --> 01:29:25,779
- There's a 747 in trouble.
- It's a 727. Time to go to work.

1080
01:29:25,863 --> 01:29:28,365
You need a hand?

1081
01:29:29,325 --> 01:29:31,827
- A hand?
- Yeah, any help?

1082
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:35,664
I never had any help.

1083
01:29:35,748 --> 01:29:38,334
- Could be some heavy lifting.
- Yeah?

1084
01:29:38,417 --> 01:29:40,294
- OK.
- Yeah? Really?

1085
01:29:40,377 --> 01:29:44,173
- Yes.
- Yes. All right.

1086
01:29:46,301 --> 01:29:48,762
OK, ready. Here I go.

1087
01:29:56,895 --> 01:29:58,855
Yeah.

1088
01:29:59,773 --> 01:30:02,776
- Love you, honey.
- We'll be waiting.

1089
01:30:04,611 --> 01:30:08,824
What are we gonna do with this stuff?
Wanna get a beer?

1090
01:30:08,907 --> 01:30:11,076
- Sure.
- Let's do it.

1091
01:32:12,198 --> 01:32:17,453
My God. You really do have superpowers.

1092
01:32:17,537 --> 01:32:21,123
Yeah. Well, it helps
when you haven't used them

1093
01:32:21,207 --> 01:32:27,755
in two years, three months,
one week and four days.

1094
01:32:27,839 --> 01:32:31,759
OK, now. I got one more in me. Here we go.
