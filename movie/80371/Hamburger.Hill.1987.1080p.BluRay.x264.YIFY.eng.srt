Medic! Medic!

Oh, shit! Medic, god,

4
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,135
Motown!

00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:23,012
Get the fuck outta here.

6
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:34,024
Move it! Move it!

7
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:43,950
Get me the bird down here.

8
00:03:44,034 --> 00:03:44,659
God damn!

9
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:47,955
Red Barron two two
this Red 1-6 Charile

10
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:52,418
ldentify our location on my smoke.
There are people all over. It's over.

11
00:03:53,336 --> 00:03:55,046
Let's get outta here.

12
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:04,847
Cover the right side.

13
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:10,812
Move on! Move on!

14
00:04:12,856 --> 00:04:14,483
Let's go!

15
00:04:15,192 --> 00:04:16,527
I said come on!

16
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:46,432
What's your name?

17
00:04:46,516 --> 00:04:48,894
Mark beach.

18
00:04:49,436 --> 00:04:50,563
Where are you from?

19
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:51,730
Portwavs.

20
00:04:52,773 --> 00:04:54,483
Talk to me! Talk to me!

21
00:04:57,111 --> 00:04:59,154
That's hell of a town I hear.

22
00:05:01,115 --> 00:05:02,199
Troop!

23
00:05:33,816 --> 00:05:36,611
Come on, girl-san. Tell me how
you say that one more time.

24
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:42,617
Hey, why don't you ask her how
to say 'jailbait'... in Vietnamese?

25
00:05:45,661 --> 00:05:48,539
Look at him man, who does he think
he's kidding over there?

26
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:54,171
Hey Languilli, you'd better get your ass back in this truck.
Or her father's going to come out and cut your dick off.

27
00:05:55,005 --> 00:05:57,799
Ok, girl... wait, wait...

28
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,929
Who are you kidding man? You wouldn't know
what to do with her if you do get her.

29
00:06:04,348 --> 00:06:06,183
Unbelievable

30
00:06:09,353 --> 00:06:12,649
You souvenir me this,
I tell you. You number one.

31
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,442
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

32
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,570
Hey, troop!

33
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,407
Your dick will fall off if you
get any closer to that pussy.

34
00:06:21,491 --> 00:06:24,369
They'll keep you in the Philippines
with the black VD. You'll never get home.

35
00:06:28,248 --> 00:06:30,041
Get your ass back on that truck!

36
00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:46,684
Sergeant, Frants?

37
00:06:46,725 --> 00:06:49,979
I thought you bought a waterbuffalo
and your own rice paddy to shit in.

38
00:06:50,062 --> 00:06:51,523
Where the hell have
you been, young stuff?

39
00:06:51,606 --> 00:06:52,566
Surfing.

40
00:07:08,248 --> 00:07:10,709
I met a nurse.
/Yeah.

41
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:12,295
Round-eye.

42
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:14,172
You didn't?

43
00:07:14,255 --> 00:07:16,299
She had her own trailer on the beach.

44
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:17,300
Oh, no.

45
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:19,802
I figured what can they do to me?

46
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:23,472
Send me to Vietnam? I moved in with her.

47
00:07:24,432 --> 00:07:25,725
A round-eye?

48
00:07:25,766 --> 00:07:26,601
There it is.

49
00:07:26,642 --> 00:07:28,728
The Mama's and Papa's
found me on the beach.

50
00:07:29,437 --> 00:07:30,146
Surfing?

51
00:07:39,364 --> 00:07:40,908
Sit down, Vinstak

52
00:07:47,956 --> 00:07:50,918
What the hell are you
wearing that shit for?

53
00:07:52,211 --> 00:07:54,923
It's gonna dehydrate your ass
and not do you any good.

54
00:07:54,964 --> 00:07:57,842
But, Sarge, they told us at
Division training we had to wear...

55
00:07:59,636 --> 00:08:03,056
We had a... we had
a short time at once.

56
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:06,851
Johnny, I forget his name...
he wore a flack jacket

57
00:08:06,976 --> 00:08:09,312
two helmets... and armour underwear.

58
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:13,943
Ashau Valley. If your
time's up, your time's up.

59
00:08:17,905 --> 00:08:19,865
What's the Anshaw Valley?

60
00:09:14,297 --> 00:09:15,632
Hey, ladies, are you free tonight?

61
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:37,614
Let's go. Which way is it?

62
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:46,039
Goddamn, look at this!

63
00:09:47,081 --> 00:09:49,709
I'm going to put the new guys in your squad.
/Oh shit!

64
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:51,252
Hey, don't 'oh shit' me, troop.

65
00:09:51,294 --> 00:09:54,506
The old man has me breaking-in another new Lieutenant.
He looks like Palmolive-fucking-soap.

66
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:56,467
Yeah, well I don't need
this f-n-g shit, Worcester.

67
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,969
Yeah, well write you Congressman
and you can tell him. I need a steak...

68
00:09:59,094 --> 00:10:01,347
a bucket of cold beer and a round-eye
to wrap my leg around.

69
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:05,726
Lieutenant Eaden.
/Sergeant?

70
00:10:05,768 --> 00:10:07,061
How are you?

71
00:10:12,107 --> 00:10:16,363
Watch your backs. Come on this
isn't a parking lot for Christ's sake.

72
00:10:16,446 --> 00:10:17,447
Come on, Gaigin.

73
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:22,202
Here you go.

74
00:10:23,453 --> 00:10:24,579
That all you got?

75
00:10:25,622 --> 00:10:27,541
What did they say that signal
for incoming rounds was?

76
00:10:27,624 --> 00:10:30,210
Hey man, I can't tell the difference
between incoming and outgoing.

77
00:10:30,293 --> 00:10:32,921
I dove off the shitter up at Evans
and it was our stuff going out.

78
00:10:33,004 --> 00:10:34,673
I think it's two long sirens.

79
00:10:34,756 --> 00:10:35,966
Don't worry about it.

80
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:40,096
Hey man, I'm not worrying about it. I just think that it's
important to know the signals for incoming rounds, all right?

81
00:10:40,263 --> 00:10:42,557
Don't worry nobody's
getting in here tonight.

82
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,559
What's the signal for ground attack?

83
00:10:44,642 --> 00:10:45,601
Three short ones.

84
00:10:45,643 --> 00:10:46,936
Green star cluster.

85
00:10:46,978 --> 00:10:49,897
Oh yeah, that's great for a night time,
what are we gonna do during the day?

86
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:52,233
Did you know that bird shit and paratroopers
are the only things that fall out of the sky?

87
00:10:55,653 --> 00:10:58,115
Sarge. Are there any women here?

88
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,495
Hey, I'm not screwing any whore.

89
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:05,455
Shit!

90
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,332
What man, you'd eat her pussy.

91
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,460
Hey man, if you can't try it,
I don't eat it.

92
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,463
A year is a long time, tellows.

93
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:19,971
That's Clare.

94
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,351
If she's fucking for peace man,
I'm on the wrong side.

95
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,482
Stop it, back off.

96
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,820
Cool it!

97
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,864
I'm marrying her, man.

98
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,409
I meant nothing by it.

99
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:42,953
Beletsky.

100
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:44,413
Languilli.

101
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:48,167
Shake hands, Man.

102
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:52,004
We're airborne.
We don't Start fights.

103
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,090
We finish'em.

104
00:12:00,931 --> 00:12:02,724
Vincent Languilli.

105
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:04,726
Joseph Beletsky.

106
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:19,075
Mama San!

107
00:12:19,158 --> 00:12:21,452
Sergeant Watkistin!

108
00:12:21,536 --> 00:12:24,622
Hi. Where have you been for so long?

109
00:12:26,749 --> 00:12:28,417
Bye-Bye.

110

Oh, my god.

Water bookoo hot, Girlsan. Number ten.
Ahhh, I like it hot.

113
00:12:53,193 --> 00:12:55,445
I want to get this red dirt out of my body.
/Oh, man.

114
00:12:55,487 --> 00:12:59,032
Ya'all can take a hundred baths still

115
00:13:04,414 --> 00:13:07,709
You two, not MP are you?

00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:13,506
They number 10,000,

Oh man, that little dicks.
Same same, Marvin the Arvin.

125
00:13:46,082 --> 00:13:49,711
Arvin is useless. He's tired
of fighting your fuckin war.

126
00:13:49,794 --> 00:13:53,089
My fuckin war? My fuckin war?

127
00:13:53,715 --> 00:13:56,009
You say my fuckin war?

130
00:14:09,857 --> 00:14:11,901
PX perfect chance.

131
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,445
There it is.

132
00:14:18,866 --> 00:14:22,246
GI never leave. No question.

133
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:36,385
Hey, you were, as you were.

134
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:46,771
The question is, how many of us have to boom boom before
those mean little bastards from the North show up.

135
00:14:46,855 --> 00:14:49,649
Now that's the question.
/Yahoo!

136
00:15:16,594 --> 00:15:20,306
Welcome to the first platoon. I'm Lituenant Eaton.
Follow us with me if you will, gentlemen.

137
00:15:20,431 --> 00:15:23,894
Put your full name on line one.
Address on line two.

138
00:15:23,935 --> 00:15:27,689
All right, if you do not want anyone notified in
case of injury, check box three.

139
00:15:27,772 --> 00:15:32,027
Otherwise, fill in the name. Last name first,
first name last and address on line four.

140
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,321
Line five is for beneficiary.

141
00:15:34,362 --> 00:15:39,201
All right, you have in your possession forms
for savings bonds, serious E types.

142
00:15:39,743 --> 00:15:43,873
Actually, I highly recommend this plan for you men.
It's a good plan for the future.

143
00:15:43,956 --> 00:15:46,584
The white card should be
filled out by married men.

144
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:49,962
This allows for joint access to
your funds in case of an emergency.

145
00:15:50,463 --> 00:15:52,340
You have postcards, fill these out.

146
00:15:52,381 --> 00:15:55,259
Let you're family know your safe,
how to get in touch with you.

147
00:15:55,301 --> 00:15:58,346
All right, mail is a priority.
You don't need stamps.

148
00:15:58,387 --> 00:16:03,809
You can write on a sea rat box, address it,
it will be delivered free of charge. Questions?

149
00:16:41,891 --> 00:16:42,725
Brother blood.

150
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:43,726
How's it going, Doc?

151
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,229
By hand, brother.

152
00:16:45,312 --> 00:16:47,982
How're doing man?
/How's it happenin' brotha?

153
00:16:48,023 --> 00:16:51,944
Buzz around camp is...
Doc's just got back from R and R.

154
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,905
And you're going to tell me
all the horny, jacking off details.

155
00:16:54,989 --> 00:16:57,491
Bangkok is not unbelievable man.

156
00:16:57,658 --> 00:16:59,410
What happened after
I got Med Evacuated

157
00:16:59,535 --> 00:17:01,662
Charley had the shit together.
You hear me?

158
00:17:01,745 --> 00:17:02,872
Speedy.
/Who?

159
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:06,835
The shit burner from second squad.
/Traumatic cranial contusion. I couldn't ventilate him.

160
00:17:06,877 --> 00:17:08,837
Brother Jones got blown to shit.

161
00:17:08,879 --> 00:17:10,755
Who's Jones?
/The FNG man.

162
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,216
He knew everything
the Temptations ever did.

163
00:17:13,258 --> 00:17:15,343
Make sure we got some
brothers in the squad.

164
00:17:15,427 --> 00:17:20,724
I don't want to hear no more of that rebel.
I lost my car on the mother fucking road.

165
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:25,228
And I'm crying over you.

166
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:30,067
Hey Sarge, Sarge. Look a minute.
I've got a flash for you.

167
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:34,238
Some brother I was hanging out
with over at Delta company.

168
00:17:34,322 --> 00:17:35,907
Drives iron raven.

169
00:17:36,741 --> 00:17:41,120
Don't shit me, Sarge. Rumor has it
we're going back into the Ashau.

170
00:17:43,414 --> 00:17:44,665
Shit.

171
00:17:44,749 --> 00:17:49,713
Come on Sarge, man you know. I'm too short for that shit.
The Doc ain't gonna give me a profile.

172
00:17:49,796 --> 00:17:52,174
Why don't you see if there's a job
for me over at headquarters.

173
00:17:52,257 --> 00:17:56,094
They don't take niggers
back at headquarters, brother.

174
00:17:56,136 --> 00:17:58,472
All the white mother
fuckers are back there.

175
00:18:03,435 --> 00:18:05,354
Remove the protective
wrapping from the tooth brush.

176
00:18:05,437 --> 00:18:07,273
Put the wrapping next
to your left foot.

177
00:18:07,315 --> 00:18:09,901
Open the tooth paste with
the cap on top of wrapping.

178
00:18:09,943 --> 00:18:13,363
Now put general amount of
paste on the sterile bristles.

179
00:18:13,947 --> 00:18:17,951
People you will brush your teeth
in rapid verital motion for one minute.

180
00:18:18,535 --> 00:18:20,954
That's up and down for
you rebel mother fucker.

181
00:18:22,288 --> 00:18:25,041
When I say Start, you turn
to your right, you brush. Ready?

182
00:18:27,126 --> 00:18:28,170
Brush.

183
00:18:32,341 --> 00:18:35,261
You may notice a granular taste.
That's pumice.

184
00:18:35,302 --> 00:18:38,639
It's puopse is to seal the teeth
and allow the flouride to penetrate.

185
00:18:39,473 --> 00:18:43,811
Gentlemen, in Vietnam, you will be
confronted by many organisms.

186
00:18:43,852 --> 00:18:48,650
In food, water, air...
that are foreign to Amercan bodies.

187
00:18:49,276 --> 00:18:55,532
Ringworm and Pataygo and Malaria,
ameobic dysentary and crotch rot.

188
00:18:56,491 --> 00:19:03,290
It has been found that proper dental hygene is important
component in maintaining of a healthy fighting man.

189
00:19:06,084 --> 00:19:08,754
What are you doing?

190
00:19:09,964 --> 00:19:11,757
Come on lighten up Bro.

191
00:19:22,268 --> 00:19:23,895
I am not your brother.

192
00:19:24,854 --> 00:19:28,691
Now did I tell you to spit?
/No, sir.

193
00:19:31,862 --> 00:19:34,573
If you wanna walk outta
this fucking place,

194
00:19:34,698 --> 00:19:37,868
you will listen to people who know.

195
00:19:37,951 --> 00:19:44,208
You be an individual, and l'll tagging your ugly toothless
face on it's way to a long box with metal handles.

196
00:19:46,543 --> 00:19:50,173
Now brush your teeth in a
rapid vertical motion.

197
00:19:51,216 --> 00:19:52,425
Troop!

198
00:19:59,474 --> 00:20:00,600
Let's go!

199
00:20:01,726 --> 00:20:04,354
Rise! Awake! Salute!

200
00:20:04,395 --> 00:20:09,776
Another glorious morning.
You scroungy ass sons of bitches.

201
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,987
You found a home in the army,
Wortchester.

202
00:20:12,071 --> 00:20:13,405
Hey thanks to hear you yong fellow.

203
00:20:13,447 --> 00:20:16,700
Hey I'm low life of forty one
and wake up and out side of Vietnam,

204
00:20:16,742 --> 00:20:18,577
Viet fucking green machine.

205
00:20:18,661 --> 00:20:22,373
L'll probably be a fucking civilian with places to go,
people to see. Things to do.

206
00:20:29,171 --> 00:20:33,301
I want you to keep on eye on these guys.
In case we gotta go back to Ashau.

207
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,721
Don't mean nothing.

208
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,268
Man, don't these people
play no Tammy Wynette.

209
00:20:46,898 --> 00:20:48,400
Did you sleep last night?

210
00:20:48,483 --> 00:20:49,859
I kept seeing things.

211
00:20:49,943 --> 00:20:52,280
What do you mean
you kept seeing things?

212
00:20:54,782 --> 00:20:55,992
Did you sleep?

213
00:20:58,619 --> 00:20:59,954
Did you hear something?

214
00:20:59,996 --> 00:21:03,082
Oh this is bull shit.

215
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,334
You gotta sleep.

216
00:21:06,711 --> 00:21:08,963
What are gonna do
stay hear for years?

217
00:21:11,341 --> 00:21:12,676
All right, listen up.

218
00:21:14,428 --> 00:21:16,930
You people are not dying
on me in combat.

219
00:21:16,972 --> 00:21:19,892
You fucking, new guys will do
everything to prove me wrong.

220
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:22,769
You'll walk on trails, kickcans... sleep
on guard, smoke dope and diddely-bop...

221
00:21:22,853 --> 00:21:25,564
through the bush like you were back
on the block.

222
00:21:26,148 --> 00:21:30,277
On guard at night you'll write letters, play with your organ...
and think of your girl back home. Forget her.

223
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:33,489
Some hair head has her on her right now...
and is telling her to fuck for peace.

224
00:21:33,573 --> 00:21:34,991
This is Han.

225
00:21:41,831 --> 00:21:45,335
Those of you who are foolish will think
of him as... gook, slope, slant or dink.

226
00:21:45,418 --> 00:21:46,544
He is your enemy.

227
00:21:46,628 --> 00:21:51,424
He came over on the Chieu Hoi programme.
And he will go back there after he fattens on C-rations.

228
00:21:51,507 --> 00:21:55,054
And he will be hunting your
young asss in the Ashau Valley.

229
00:21:55,137 --> 00:21:57,014
Now forget about this Viet Cong shit.

230
00:21:58,224 --> 00:22:01,810
What you'll encounter out there is...
hard core. NVA, north Vietnamese...

231
00:22:01,936 --> 00:22:04,188
motivated, highly trained
and well equipped.

232
00:22:05,231 --> 00:22:07,733
If you meet Hanor his cousins,
you will give him respect.

233
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:10,945
And refer to those little bastards
as the Nathanial Victor.

234
00:22:11,528 --> 00:22:16,534
Meet'em twice and survive, you will
call him mister Nathanial Victor.

235
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:22,624
People, I am tired... of filling
body bags with your dumb fucking mistakes.

236
00:22:24,501 --> 00:22:25,877
Do you think this funny?

237
00:22:29,673 --> 00:22:30,757
Alphabet.

238
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,175
Languilli.

239
00:22:33,344 --> 00:22:36,847
Han is closing in on your position.
It's night, look at me.

240
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:39,850
I'm gonna save your life
and your gonna save mine.

241
00:22:41,602 --> 00:22:43,396
It's night, it's raining.

242
00:22:43,437 --> 00:22:46,399
While you're thinking about peace,
love and whether or not we should be in Vietnam.

243
00:22:46,482 --> 00:22:50,111
Han is going to cut your fucking throat. And your sleeping.
/No, Sergeant.

244
00:22:50,194 --> 00:22:53,865
You've been humping the boonies for months.
Your turn to sleep, your allowed to sleep.

245
00:22:54,032 --> 00:22:57,160
What do you think Han is going to do?
Ls he going to wake up Alphabet and smile?

246
00:22:57,244 --> 00:22:58,662
And talk about women?

247
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:02,040
Mister Nathanial Victor gets his
rocks off watching you die.

248
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:05,294
Some of you think you have problems
because your're against the war.

249
00:23:05,377 --> 00:23:09,464
You demonstrated in school... you wear peace symbols on your steel.
And you have attitudes.

250
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:16,055
I'm orphan, my brother's queer, the city of
Chicago got the clap from my sister.

251
00:23:16,097 --> 00:23:17,765
Mum drinks, Dad coughs blood.

252
00:23:17,849 --> 00:23:20,143
I have ring worm, emersion
foot... the incurable crud

253
00:23:20,226 --> 00:23:23,521
and the draught ruined my chances
of being a brain surge on people.

254
00:23:23,605 --> 00:23:25,231
You have no problem.

255
00:23:28,151 --> 00:23:29,611
Except me.

256
00:23:31,446 --> 00:23:32,780
And him.

257
00:24:39,142 --> 00:24:40,269
Hey, pal.

258
00:24:43,814 --> 00:24:46,650
You know where I can
find general Rufferman?

259
00:24:47,192 --> 00:24:51,238
Not friend of mine.
He is major genral, two stars.

260
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:53,824
I am supposed to deliver
this to trailer to him.

261
00:24:53,865 --> 00:24:55,909
And I can't find anyone to sign for it.

262
00:24:56,034 --> 00:24:57,912
Hey l'll sign for it.

263
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,831
I'm responsible for this.

264
00:25:00,456 --> 00:25:01,499
Well look at it.

265
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,168
Keepin the army forever to pay it off.

266
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:08,047
Everybody shoots at me.
Especially grunts.

267
00:25:10,633 --> 00:25:13,553
I'm just rolling highway
sinder hunt and seek.

268
00:25:14,178 --> 00:25:16,556
Listen, maybe you can
get a marine to sign for it.

269
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:21,937
Yeah. Yeah, thanks a lot.
Those guys are dancing.

270
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:41,333
This is one weird place.

271
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:48,506
Seventeen fucking wake up
and l'll never eat this shit again.

272
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:52,385
You hear what I'm saying sarge?
/We are in the army, man.

273
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,180
What are you gonna do when
you are back in the world?

274
00:25:56,389 --> 00:26:00,186
I got places to go,
things to do, people to see.

275
00:26:00,228 --> 00:26:01,938
Yeah but how are you gonna act?

276
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:08,819
Like a PFC, Private fucking civilian.

277
00:26:08,903 --> 00:26:11,948
You are talkinig, you don't know
what you're saying, brother.

278
00:26:12,031 --> 00:26:13,950
You ever heard of boony rap?

279
00:26:14,033 --> 00:26:16,869
Fuck this, shit on that, no fucking way.

280
00:26:16,953 --> 00:26:19,206
I love that mother fucking bastards.

281
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:22,000
You back off Motown
cuz I got my fucking act.

282
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:30,259
Look man, I got my act together. OK?

283
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,219
My shit's straight man.

284
00:26:33,053 --> 00:26:36,598
You know a straighter and more intellegent brother
in first platoon then me?

285
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:41,145
Hey listen up, he's got college.

286
00:26:42,897 --> 00:26:45,692
One time I went home
on special emergency leave,

287
00:26:45,775 --> 00:26:48,111
My mama made me a
special meal man with

288
00:26:48,152 --> 00:26:53,283
everything I love, I mean greens,
fresh vegetable, potatos, candies...

289
00:26:53,324 --> 00:26:55,034
I happened to like baked ham.

290
00:26:55,159 --> 00:27:00,624
So whole my family was there, and I said to myself, Motown
you got these people fooled.

291
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:03,752
I mean the day before that,
we were humping in Ashau valley,

292
00:27:03,836 --> 00:27:06,255
and now I'm home with my family.

293
00:27:06,338 --> 00:27:09,341
And I'm skatin man.
No problems. Number one.

294
00:27:09,425 --> 00:27:13,679
I smile at my mama. Great meal, ma.

295
00:27:14,847 --> 00:27:17,766
Would you please pass the fucking potatoes.

296
00:27:20,103 --> 00:27:24,274
The ham is fucking A, ma.

297
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:29,404
You don't know how... how
fucking great it is to be home.

298
00:27:33,992 --> 00:27:35,869
How you gonna act, huh?

299
00:27:36,578 --> 00:27:38,538
You really want to know, Motown?

300
00:27:41,709 --> 00:27:44,503
I'm gonna walk down Central Avenue.

301
00:27:45,212 --> 00:27:47,590
My jump boots, my medals.

302
00:27:49,717 --> 00:27:51,636
Shit, it's gonna be all right.

303
00:27:52,386 --> 00:27:54,096
You'd better not wear your uniform.

304
00:27:55,097 --> 00:27:56,891
Who's talking to you?

305
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:07,778
This man... has been fighting for the
fucking United States of white America.

306
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:14,534
And you going to try to advise him...
that he can't wear his jump boots.

307
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:19,206
You guys... don't know shit.

308
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:40,728
Commending General believes that
one of the most depressing problems

309
00:28:40,812 --> 00:28:44,358
we face in Vietnam today
is Vineraal disease.

310
00:28:44,441 --> 00:28:48,862
We have found the best way of contracting any one of
the nine known strands

311
00:28:48,946 --> 00:28:55,411
of Syphilis, and or Gohnorrea is
to avoid contact with the indigenous.

312
00:28:55,494 --> 00:28:57,830
Vietnamese female personnel.

313
00:29:00,874 --> 00:29:07,132
However, remember, lie da
homo chai bokoo eeon.

314
00:29:08,216 --> 00:29:11,136
Lie da homo chai bokoo eeon.

315
00:29:11,219 --> 00:29:15,181
It' the same anywhere Galvan.
You got to know the right words to score.

316
00:29:18,935 --> 00:29:20,395
L'll go get us some shampoo.

317
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,789
Tafee.

318
00:29:38,831 --> 00:29:40,291
What are you doing?

319
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:43,210
It's called meditation.

320
00:29:48,216 --> 00:29:49,760
How do you know
whether or not it's working?

321
00:29:51,011 --> 00:29:53,972
Incoming!

322
00:30:07,362 --> 00:30:10,823
Cold steel. Check point five... Two. Over.

323
00:30:11,824 --> 00:30:13,451
Fire Mission. Over.

324
00:30:17,538 --> 00:30:19,499
Fire Mission. Over.

325
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,964
They must have a
spotter in that tree line.

326
00:30:47,237 --> 00:30:49,906
Fire! Standing by

327
00:30:52,576 --> 00:30:56,496
Rounds out. Rounds out. Rounds out.

328
00:31:34,453 --> 00:31:36,997
Cease fire. Cease fire!

329
00:31:46,174 --> 00:31:49,761
Red 16. This is 16.
What's the situation. Over.

330
00:31:51,304 --> 00:31:56,309
Red 16. This is 16.
What's the situation. Over.

331
00:32:17,498 --> 00:32:18,457
Who is it?

332
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,172
How the hell do I know.
He's got no goddamn head.

333
00:32:27,801 --> 00:32:29,636
It's one of the new guys.

334
00:32:30,845 --> 00:32:35,225
You got to tell these men to put an extra set of I.D.
Tags on their boots one each.

335
00:32:35,308 --> 00:32:39,729
Then this kind of shit wouldn't happen.
How the hell am I supposed to identify these people.

336
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:44,859
Now you take it easy, Doc.

337
00:32:54,912 --> 00:32:57,039
L'll take it any way I can.

338
00:33:05,464 --> 00:33:07,842
I've got to know who you are.

339
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,056
How's this. How's this?

340
00:33:21,481 --> 00:33:23,358
Where's Gates?
He's in there all night.

341
00:33:23,984 --> 00:33:26,904
I know I'm going to be next.
I know that, Goddammit!

342
00:33:27,696 --> 00:33:31,159
I'm next, Doc.
/You ain't next!

343
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:32,368
I'm next, Doc.

344
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:36,956
I don't care what y'all say.
You got that life all you want.

345
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:42,879
Now we'll see, Goddammit.
I'm tired of all your shit.

346
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:46,090
Seven cards are squared.
Single titties are wild.

347
00:33:49,261 --> 00:33:50,179
You say it boss.

348
00:34:43,484 --> 00:34:47,071
Yeah, you could fart in a balloon and
paint it red and Marine would love it.

349
00:34:47,905 --> 00:34:48,823
It's true.

350
00:34:56,164 --> 00:34:57,749
Your too big for her.

351
00:35:00,794 --> 00:35:03,422
What's Elstavitz doing? Vinstock.

352
00:35:03,505 --> 00:35:06,383
I don't know Sarge.
/You should.

353
00:35:06,466 --> 00:35:07,968
Is he...

354
00:35:08,677 --> 00:35:11,097
You white boys are strange about that.

355
00:35:13,141 --> 00:35:16,185
Don't get lost Beanie. Wooahh.

356
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:20,189
Watcha doin' in Vietnam. Boy.

357
00:35:23,401 --> 00:35:25,111
Volunteered, bro.

358
00:35:25,194 --> 00:35:29,157
You know, the brothers
are here, because we're black.

359
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:31,326
They don't think we're educated.

360
00:35:31,869 --> 00:35:33,662
That's bullshit.

361
00:35:39,043 --> 00:35:43,672
Say what FNG? FNG?

362
00:36:00,023 --> 00:36:02,359
Hey Andy, lack off, lack off!

363
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,240
My name isn't Alphabet. It's Languilly, Vinny.
My first name is Vincent.

364
00:36:09,991 --> 00:36:11,910
What's my name, Doc?

365
00:36:13,621 --> 00:36:15,248
You're name is Vincent.

366
00:36:18,292 --> 00:36:19,919
All right, get him outta here.

367
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,885
You GI's are all...

368
00:36:31,264 --> 00:36:33,141
You people will not
die on me in combat.

369
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:34,851
Galvin was good.
He always did everything right.

370
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:37,521
What difference does it make. We've been up and down
this same terrain since I got here. For what?

371
00:36:37,604 --> 00:36:38,730
All right look.

372
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:40,732
When you get home.
You can throw your boots away.

373
00:36:40,774 --> 00:36:42,985
Grow a beard, become
a Goddam hippie protestor.

374
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:43,860
I don't want to hear this shit.

375
00:36:43,944 --> 00:36:46,321
Look, I know too many
Goddamm names, Wortchester.

376
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:49,783
And I don't think one of them is
worth all of Vietnam Republic of...

377
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:52,160
Look just don't fall apart on your people, Francz.
/Oh why not?

378
00:36:52,786 --> 00:36:55,540
So I can teach 'em how to fill sand bags and burn shit.
/Hey!

379
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:58,876
They're gonna need you in
the Ashau. We're going back in.

380
00:36:59,377 --> 00:37:01,045
What the hell you think
I brought you here for.

381
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:58,502
Red six, Red six.
Red one six Charlie. Over.

382
00:40:58,544 --> 00:40:59,838
Red six. Over.

383
00:40:59,921 --> 00:41:01,715
We got LG secure.

384
00:41:01,756 --> 00:41:03,008
Negative contact. Over.

385
00:41:03,174 --> 00:41:06,845
Yo Mire! Francz. Smitty!
Move these people out.

386
00:41:08,972 --> 00:41:11,016
You'll do fine LT. Just fine.

387
00:41:13,393 --> 00:41:14,936
These guys know
what they're doing.

388
00:41:14,978 --> 00:41:16,521
Oh yeah, most definitely.

389
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:33,456
10-May-69

390
00:42:30,975 --> 00:42:35,020
Fuck you!
All of you mother fuckers!

391
00:42:40,067 --> 00:42:40,609
Fuck!

392
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:55,959
Bitch!

393
00:42:59,296 --> 00:43:00,880
Movin up Mac, on line!

394
00:43:03,843 --> 00:43:06,262
Washburn, Beletsky,
Bienstock. Move out!

395
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:09,724
Hey! Gimme some ammo!

396
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:12,935
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

397
00:43:13,853 --> 00:43:15,313
Get down! Get down!

398
00:43:15,354 --> 00:43:17,315
Give it to me! Give it to me!

399
00:43:17,356 --> 00:43:20,151
You're giving it to me,
you fucking idiot! Give it!

400
00:43:22,403 --> 00:43:23,864
Tafee, Gaigin, Move up!

401
00:43:23,905 --> 00:43:28,327
Move! Keep going! Comon!
Move! Goddamnit! Mother fucker.

402
00:43:39,046 --> 00:43:42,674
Fuck! Got to move in...

403
00:44:09,036 --> 00:44:12,414
Doc! They got Mac! They got Mac!

404
00:44:15,751 --> 00:44:17,628
Did you see him?
/No.

405
00:44:19,046 --> 00:44:20,130
We got a blood trail.

406
00:44:20,172 --> 00:44:21,799
Find the little bastard.

407
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:40,360
You're on point.
/Me?

408
00:44:40,402 --> 00:44:43,738
You've got no friendlies out there.
Got a full load.

409
00:46:20,298 --> 00:46:23,468
Nathanial Victor. FNG type.
Walking around the Ashau

410
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:26,221
with a half a canteen,
that makes a lot of noise.

411
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:28,724
Where's the body?

412
00:46:32,019 --> 00:46:35,940
Maggie Kung fleet foot, face full of
black soot talking at the heat put

413
00:46:36,023 --> 00:46:39,110
plants in the bed but don't stop them
anyway. Maggie says all right.

414
00:46:39,193 --> 00:46:43,072
Here it is, October 19th.
We have been here six months.

415
00:46:43,155 --> 00:46:46,075
Now that's half way. All right?
Now I'm going to mark myself in blue.

416
00:46:46,158 --> 00:46:49,579
But I got different color pens for everybody.
You can be red if you want to be. O.K.

417
00:46:49,621 --> 00:46:51,999
But what I gotta know is did Washburn
get here the same day as us?

418
00:46:52,082 --> 00:46:53,500
Yes.
/O.K.

419
00:46:54,251 --> 00:46:57,254
And that other guy and alphabet the day before.
/Thank you sir.

420
00:46:58,547 --> 00:46:59,840
Hey guys, check this out.

421
00:47:02,259 --> 00:47:03,719
Love this Camaro.

422
00:47:03,802 --> 00:47:05,762
It's you. It's a ride, man.

423
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:17,650
We did good today, didn't we?

424
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:21,821
We got our cherries busted
today, didn't we Sarge?

425
00:47:25,783 --> 00:47:27,410
One of my people got killed.

426
00:47:29,455 --> 00:47:30,831
That's all that happened today.

427
00:47:37,296 --> 00:47:40,424
You knew that man wasn't going to
slack off because he was short.

428
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,429
You knew that brother
was going do his job.

429
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,473
Then why didn't you put him on profile.

430
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:50,727
Because... he is one healthy individual.

431
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:54,981
I've got people in this fucking platoon
who are so sick they wouldn't be allowed in the hospital.

432
00:47:55,065 --> 00:47:57,776
But out here they have to
ruck up, move out and press on.

433
00:47:59,486 --> 00:48:00,987
It don't mean nothing, man.

434
00:48:01,071 --> 00:48:02,489
It don't mean nothing...

435
00:48:05,617 --> 00:48:06,618
Come on, man...

436
00:48:06,701 --> 00:48:10,498
You owe it to yourself... yourself.

437
00:48:19,298 --> 00:48:22,259
It don't mean nothing. Not a thing man.

438
00:48:22,343 --> 00:48:44,032
It don't mean nothing. Not a thing.

439
00:48:44,074 --> 00:48:48,161
Right. You don't mean
nothing brother, not a thing.

440
00:48:48,245 --> 00:48:54,794
It don't mean nothing man,
not a thing. Nothing.

441
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:15,441
We got a... we got McDaniels
body on a trailor truck.

442
00:49:20,863 --> 00:49:23,324
All he wanted to do was go
home in his jump boots.

443
00:49:27,036 --> 00:49:29,038
Couldn't believe they called him a jerk.

444
00:49:30,706 --> 00:49:31,958
And worse.

445
00:49:35,837 --> 00:49:40,675
Ya know, people get hurt out here.

446
00:49:40,717 --> 00:49:45,096
C'mon. Don't tell me he died for God,
country and one-hundred
and first airborne...

447
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:48,058
Hey man, I'd never
say that shit to anybody.

448
00:49:50,018 --> 00:49:51,227
Dan didn't die for anything.

449
00:49:51,311 --> 00:49:55,566
He didn't leave his goddamn
guts on a goddamn trail in
goddamn Ashaw Valley.

450
00:49:55,608 --> 00:49:58,736
For a home town medal
or any of that bullshit.

451
00:50:02,365 --> 00:50:05,534
Cranked his automatic weapon
and took it out. For you and for

452
00:50:05,576 --> 00:50:09,038
the third squad. Man, don't you
give him anything less.

453
00:50:11,791 --> 00:50:13,961
You get out of this valley, Worcester.

454
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:17,506
I'm gonna kick your ass.

455
00:50:21,969 --> 00:50:24,930
Battalion wants us to go back to
where Frantz made contact today.

456
00:50:24,972 --> 00:50:28,809
They say there are some stragglers
left on this area Hill 937.

457
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:31,812
Those KIA's were clean and well
equipped. They weren't stragglers.

458
00:50:31,853 --> 00:50:36,484
Military Intelligence says there is no organized...
Military Intelligence could fuck up a wet dream, sir.

459
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:41,364
All right man, let's call it. All right? We're on the same side here, right?
Tomorrow morning we'll just get our people quietly off this hill.

460
00:50:41,531 --> 00:50:46,369
Tomorrow we'll recon 937,call in alog
bird for hot chow and clean socks.

461
00:50:47,578 --> 00:50:49,789
Isn't that right, Lieutenant?
/Roger that.

462

Murphy's calling in. H and I delta line

464
00:50:59,425 --> 00:51:03,971
dry socks, clean water,
salt fill, ammo, just in case.

465
00:51:08,309 --> 00:51:10,686
Alright gather around.
C'mon. Listen up.

466
00:51:14,607 --> 00:51:17,277

467
00:51:26,202 --> 00:51:28,204
Red Six 1-6 Charlie. Over.

468
00:51:30,206 --> 00:51:35,379
The 1-6 Charlie preparing to assault
the 3-0 north of the faze line. Over.

469
00:51:36,797 --> 00:51:38,382
All right, we're getting 2 T small arms.

470
00:51:38,466 --> 00:51:41,135
May 11
From up there Black Jack wants
up to mop up any stragglers.

471
00:51:41,218 --> 00:51:45,723
First and second squad and move out from here.
I want you to take your people and move them in a flanking position.

472
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:48,559
Make believers out of
these sorry ass bastards.

473
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,650
O.K. Let's move it.
Second squad. Move on.

474
00:51:55,817 --> 00:51:56,985
First squad. Move out.

475
00:51:58,153 --> 00:51:59,237
This isn't the plan we worked out man.

476
00:51:59,321 --> 00:52:00,822
We're supposed to be
going up that other hill.

477
00:52:00,906 --> 00:52:05,160
It's the same old shit man.
Man and bird wants to play war.

478
00:52:32,772 --> 00:52:36,110
Red six... out this is 1-6 out...
Brad!! Move your people!

479
00:52:47,204 --> 00:52:50,958
Red six... out this is 1-6 out mark
four coordinates for cold steel. Over.

480
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:51,792
Duffy!

481
00:52:53,711 --> 00:52:56,381
Take your weapons forward until
your covering far into the friendlies.

482
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:58,383
Move. Move. Move.

483
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,721
Put you around
seventy five meters down.

484
00:53:12,897 --> 00:53:13,982
That's what I wanted.

485
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,413
These proper radio procedure...

486
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,531
Hear from your old lady?

487
00:54:02,617 --> 00:54:03,952
Ever happened.

488
00:54:27,393 --> 00:54:29,812
Languilli, remember the basic?

489
00:54:29,812 --> 00:54:32,982
They told us the way to cover an eye
in case the flareoes so that we lose our night vision?

490
00:54:33,065 --> 00:54:33,816
They said that.

491
00:54:33,899 --> 00:54:35,401
OK, so what they meant?

492
00:54:36,151 --> 00:54:38,989
Does it matter if which eye we cover?

493
00:54:39,072 --> 00:54:43,076
Good eye for the night vision
or the one for the flare.

494
00:54:43,827 --> 00:54:48,331
Beletsky do you stay awake at night thing of
the things you should worry about?

495
00:55:04,098 --> 00:55:05,433
What are you doing?

496
00:55:05,433 --> 00:55:07,018
We were just having
some hot chocolate.

497
00:55:08,102 --> 00:55:10,104
You here anything.
/Nothing.

498
00:55:10,187 --> 00:55:13,691
Camp on the Delta Post.
Same same. Negative sit rep.

499
00:55:13,858 --> 00:55:15,609
Looks like we're gettin' out
of here tomorrow.

500
00:55:15,776 --> 00:55:18,529
I'm going straight to the PX
and ordering that Firebird.

501
00:55:20,449 --> 00:55:21,783
What happened to the Camaro?

502
00:55:26,121 --> 00:55:28,123
My dad won't drive
anything but a Buick.

503
00:55:37,799 --> 00:55:39,384
Push in on the bullshit net.

504
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:41,471
What's the bullshit net?

505
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:42,722
Hanoi Hanna.

506
00:55:42,805 --> 00:55:46,142
Best sounds in the valley.
And boy does she have a rap.

507
00:55:46,809 --> 00:55:48,144
We love you too much...

508
00:55:48,227 --> 00:55:51,564
drop your weapons and Uncle Ho
will give youa water buffalo...

509
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:53,816
your own rice paddy to shit in.

510
00:55:57,070 --> 00:56:01,659
Sometimes they get American assholes...
to tell us what assholes we are.

511
00:56:04,161 --> 00:56:06,163
No lie, man. It's a trip.

512
00:56:06,997 --> 00:56:09,416
American soldiers... and marines

513
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:15,172
embrace the heroic people of Vietnam...
like many of your heroic countrymen...

514
00:56:16,173 --> 00:56:19,176
why fight the heroic
people's army... while your own

515
00:56:19,259 --> 00:56:23,515
Government betrays you... and the heroic
American friends of Vietnam...

516
00:56:23,515 --> 00:56:26,101
If you have to smoke it at nigh
put a poncho over your head.

517
00:56:26,184 --> 00:56:31,189
And I would like to send this special dedication...
to the Screaming Eagles in the Ashau Valley.

518
00:56:32,273 --> 00:56:35,694
You may be killed any
time day or night...

519
00:56:35,777 --> 00:56:39,280
like your shadow, death is following you...

520
00:56:39,364 --> 00:56:41,200
Everywhere.

521
00:56:49,542 --> 00:56:51,877
Bad dream.

522
00:56:56,465 --> 00:56:58,467
How much am I supposed to
remember all this shit.

523
00:56:58,551 --> 00:57:01,470
Panchos over your head,
no half canteens.

524
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:05,726
Dog tags on your boots.
Carry the claimor detonator while your setting them up.

525
00:57:05,809 --> 00:57:08,729
Orange pills once a week,
whites daily, daily.

526
00:57:09,313 --> 00:57:13,400
Oh don't ever walk on trails.
Boot in the sock. Harrows on the water.

527
00:57:13,483 --> 00:57:16,903
Secure your frags.
And now, now this bullshit.

528
00:57:16,987 --> 00:57:19,906
And the whole time, I'm worried
I might forget something.

529
00:57:48,437 --> 00:57:50,105
All right, on your feet, wake up...

530
00:57:50,189 --> 00:57:51,440
it's time to earn your combat pay.

531
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,192
Come on.
/Come on. Let's go.

532
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:56,445
Hey Motown, fuck you!

533
00:57:56,528 --> 00:57:58,280
I need some goddamn boots, Sarge.

534
00:57:58,364 --> 00:58:00,366
My whole fucking body hurts.

535
00:58:00,449 --> 00:58:01,617
My dick hurts!

536
00:58:01,617 --> 00:58:03,119
Then drop ten and beat it.

537
00:58:04,037 --> 00:58:05,789
I don't want to hear
anymore of this shit.

538
00:58:06,456 --> 00:58:08,124
Now you get your
head out of your asses.

539
00:58:08,958 --> 00:58:10,961
Black Jack wants us to take this hill.

540
00:58:10,961 --> 00:58:12,462
What's he going to do with it?

541
00:58:15,215 --> 00:58:18,051
Pave it and turn it
into a goddamn parking lot.

542
00:58:18,635 --> 00:58:19,803
Now move out.

543
00:58:34,235 --> 00:58:37,154
Cold steel, cold steel
this is 1-6 alpha, over.

544
00:58:37,238 --> 00:58:39,407
Tell 6 that the little bastards
have got some Claimors in the trees

545
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:40,658
And they're blowing the shit out of us.

546
00:58:40,658 --> 00:58:42,243
So get us some goddamn fire support.

547
00:58:42,326 --> 00:58:45,163
Cold steel, cold steel.
This is 1-6 alpha, over.

548
00:58:47,499 --> 00:58:48,917
Come in 2-0

549
00:58:49,001 --> 00:58:50,836
There wounded out could be
pressing fire from that bunk line.

550
00:58:50,919 --> 00:58:52,004
Pressing fire from that bunk line.

551
00:58:52,087 --> 00:58:52,587
No shit.

552
00:58:52,754 --> 00:58:54,840
Worcester, pull these men out.

553
00:58:56,758 --> 00:58:58,176
Move it out! Move it out!!

554
00:59:10,273 --> 00:59:12,275
My leg! Fuck!

555
01:00:11,671 --> 01:00:13,255
You're mine! Mother fucker!

556
01:00:31,942 --> 01:00:33,360
You fuckin' stink!

557
01:00:34,194 --> 01:00:34,945
Duffy!

558
01:00:41,785 --> 01:00:42,619
Watch out!

559
01:00:49,043 --> 01:00:51,629
Clear this area Motown!
Cover it point blank!

560
01:00:51,713 --> 01:00:53,297
Set up that gun!

561
01:00:56,301 --> 01:00:56,968
Where's Doc?

562
01:00:59,053 --> 01:01:02,140
Get him and the horn and tell him
we got his goddamn bunker!

563
01:01:03,057 --> 01:01:04,475
Run the horn.

564
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:05,643
I can't hear you.

565
01:01:09,315 --> 01:01:11,233
It's 1-6 out there over!

566
01:01:15,988 --> 01:01:17,156
C'mon, help me down there.

567
01:01:17,239 --> 01:01:19,158
There's nothing wrong with you.

568
01:01:19,241 --> 01:01:20,409
Get down there.

569
01:01:22,328 --> 01:01:23,829
Talk to me! Talk to me!

570
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:30,503
Say Alphabet! Alphabet! Say it!

571
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:35,342
Cmon Duffy! Duffy! Say Alphabet!

572
01:02:02,203 --> 01:02:03,120
Sarge,

573
01:02:04,288 --> 01:02:07,124
I asked everybody who they think.

574
01:02:08,459 --> 01:02:11,797
Nobody did it. Was it you?

575
01:02:11,963 --> 01:02:13,715
Maybe he died of natural causes.

576
01:02:17,135 --> 01:02:18,804
Half his head was blown away.

577
01:02:19,638 --> 01:02:21,390
Sounds like a natural cause to me.

578
01:02:21,556 --> 01:02:23,225
When can you get him out of here?

579
01:02:25,227 --> 01:02:28,730
In a boot coot fucked up dude from
the second squad ahead of Duffy.

580
01:02:29,482 --> 01:02:30,817
Hey, it don't mean nothing.

581
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,488
Where's my weapon?

582
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,278
We have taken the bunker

583
01:03:13,361 --> 01:03:14,946
And are preparing to move up the hill.

584
01:03:15,113 --> 01:03:16,364
All right. Worcester.

585
01:03:27,625 --> 01:03:30,128
Let's move people
and take this fuckin' hill.

586
01:03:31,964 --> 01:03:32,965
Let's go!

587
01:04:37,616 --> 01:04:40,536
Get me some ammo!

588
01:04:41,787 --> 01:04:45,207
Duffy! I'm coming.

589
01:05:22,413 --> 01:05:25,583
No. No cease fire.

590
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:32,173
Hold it up there firing
at our people. Hold it up!

591
01:05:44,603 --> 01:05:50,776
Stop it! Man! God dammit!
Jesus Christ!

592
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:05,604
They said they are gonna
send some resupply today.

593
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:17,868
Get back on your horn and tell them we, our people,
need food and water now not later.

594
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:24,875
This is 16 alpha over.

595
01:07:32,049 --> 01:07:33,467
Take a look at that map.

596
01:07:37,805 --> 01:07:38,723
Sergent.

597
01:07:44,896 --> 01:07:46,731
We are in Ashau valley.

598
01:07:47,648 --> 01:07:50,985
And we ain't going no where
except back up to that goddamn hill.

599
01:07:57,910 --> 01:07:59,328
L'll get you a map.

600
01:08:07,336 --> 01:08:10,506
You put the tape in there
and you press that button.

601
01:08:12,424 --> 01:08:13,926
It's from my girl Claire.

602
01:08:13,926 --> 01:08:15,177
Just don't use all my juice.

603
01:08:18,431 --> 01:08:21,935
Now that's immoral, unjust and illegal.

604
01:08:22,018 --> 01:08:23,269
Get this Beenie.
/What?

605
01:08:25,939 --> 01:08:28,441
Oh my God! They're huge.

606
01:08:29,109 --> 01:08:34,948
She likes to lie naked on the beach.
And have her boyfriend read the profit to her.

607
01:08:35,031 --> 01:08:38,035
Oh yeah, he's probably
a long haired, foureyed faggot.

608
01:08:38,703 --> 01:08:41,706
I just don't know what to say. I-

609
01:08:41,706 --> 01:08:44,542
I don't know what time
it is where you are.

610
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:48,462
I'd like to wrap his
long hair around my body...

611
01:08:48,462 --> 01:08:51,716
while he makes love
to me all night long.

612
01:08:51,799 --> 01:08:54,301
I had dinner with your Mom and Dad.

613
01:08:54,385 --> 01:08:58,473
We read all your letters and looked at
the pictures you sent.

614
01:08:58,473 --> 01:09:02,894
She became his love prisoner.
She would do anything for him.

615
01:09:02,978 --> 01:09:06,815
Jesus Christ, I'm never going to get another haircut
as long as I fucking live.

616
01:09:07,315 --> 01:09:08,984
If you can... Joe.

617
01:09:09,818 --> 01:09:12,321
Try to smile more in the pictures.

618
01:09:12,904 --> 01:09:14,239
It would help your Mother.

619
01:09:14,906 --> 01:09:16,742
Your dad didn't say much.

620
01:09:17,242 --> 01:09:19,078
We both know what he's like.

621
01:09:19,996 --> 01:09:24,584
Katherine says... he gets up
early every morning and...

622
01:09:24,667 --> 01:09:29,672
watches the news. And he eats his
dinner in front of the TV at night.

623
01:09:30,256 --> 01:09:32,008
I think he's looking for you.

624
01:09:33,009 --> 01:09:38,681
I'm glad you have such good friends
like... like Bienstock and Langarelli.

625
01:09:38,681 --> 01:09:40,100
Languilli.

626
01:09:40,184 --> 01:09:42,186
Galvan and Frantz.

627
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:48,275
I, I want you to know one thing...

628
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:53,864
l'll always be true to you.
L'll wait for you.

629
01:09:55,366 --> 01:09:58,619
I know it must be very difficult
for you over there and...

630
01:09:58,702 --> 01:10:01,790
If you can't be true...

631
01:10:02,707 --> 01:10:05,794
if you can't wait... l'll understand.

632
01:10:06,628 --> 01:10:08,380
I know you love me.

633
01:10:09,714 --> 01:10:13,051
I love this woman,
she's telling him to get laid.

634
01:10:16,721 --> 01:10:21,143
I wish you weren't there.
I wish none of you were there.

635
01:10:23,145 --> 01:10:28,317
But I'm proud of you Joe.
I, I, I just don't think it's fair...

636
01:10:28,401 --> 01:10:33,322
that everybody is back here... acting...
acting like nothing is going on.

637
01:10:33,322 --> 01:10:38,077
Their lives are the same.
It's just not fair.

638
01:10:39,328 --> 01:10:42,165
And I don't believe
what they say about you.

639
01:10:44,084 --> 01:10:45,168
Anyhow...

640
01:10:47,004 --> 01:10:50,590
I don't care because I love all of you.

641
01:10:51,925 --> 01:10:58,432
Especially you, my darling.
Especially you my...

642
01:11:01,936 --> 01:11:03,187
Take it easy with that.

643
01:11:04,439 --> 01:11:05,523
L'll take it anyway I can.

644
01:11:05,606 --> 01:11:07,608
I told you not to use all the batteries.

645
01:11:10,278 --> 01:11:12,280
It's the goddamn nigger
music you listen to.

646
01:11:16,951 --> 01:11:18,953
All right, come on. Break it up.

647
01:11:18,953 --> 01:11:20,955
Alphabet, put shovel down.

648
01:11:23,709 --> 01:11:24,960
Now what's happening here?

649
01:11:26,962 --> 01:11:28,130
War's happening.

650
01:11:47,609 --> 01:11:52,655
No! Fuck! Oh fuck! Doc!

651
01:11:52,781 --> 01:11:56,576
On my way! On my way!
/Oh, Oh fuck!

652
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:09,256
C'mon kid. Let's go. Up

653
01:12:11,175 --> 01:12:14,428
Move! Move!

654
01:12:50,383 --> 01:12:52,301
It's definatly the vet.

655
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:54,053
You can't score on the vet.

656
01:12:54,137 --> 01:12:59,517
Oh man, stop fingure fucking dream
with your chichen shit details?

657
01:12:59,559 --> 01:13:01,644
Let me tell you something, Linguilli.

658
01:13:01,728 --> 01:13:06,650
I bombomed mama san and in the garbage dump under
deuce and a half while a girlsan reading a magazine

659
01:13:06,734 --> 01:13:10,654
and sucked on pepsi.
You can score in the vet.

660
01:13:10,738 --> 01:13:13,240
You owe it to yourself.

661
01:13:13,323 --> 01:13:16,243
Hey sarge, do you think they
gotta send us foot powder?

662
01:13:16,243 --> 01:13:19,371
Stop worry about nothing for christ'sake.

663
01:13:19,496 --> 01:13:23,083
Go back to world with bad feet.
What can they do to you, send you to Vietnam?

664
01:13:23,751 --> 01:13:26,421
I'm a salesman. This feet are my life.

665
01:13:27,505 --> 01:13:29,924
My godamn skin's peeled off.

666
01:13:30,592 --> 01:13:34,512
My socks tend to shrink.

667
01:13:36,097 --> 01:13:37,515
It's from my girlfriend.

668
01:13:41,269 --> 01:13:45,358
She said she's not gonna write any more.

669
01:13:47,943 --> 01:13:50,863
Friends at college told her it's immoral.

670
01:13:51,864 --> 01:13:53,449
To write to me.

671
01:14:58,684 --> 01:15:01,186
Medic Doc! Get your
goddam medic up here.

672
01:15:04,523 --> 01:15:10,280
Help! C'mon up! Fuckin' exhausted!

673
01:15:18,246 --> 01:15:19,706
Get a medic up here!

674
01:15:26,087 --> 01:15:28,299
C'mon Let's go!

675
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:36,223
C'mon guys let's go

676
01:15:36,307 --> 01:15:38,059
and break this fucking hill!

677
01:15:48,904 --> 01:15:50,614
Okay, let's get ready,
let's take this squad.

678
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:53,158
Teddy Ford. May 17.

679
01:15:56,870 --> 01:15:59,247
How long have you been
on this hill, soldier?

680
01:16:01,333 --> 01:16:02,334
What?

681
01:16:04,086 --> 01:16:07,214
Hey brother, how many times have you
been up and down this hill?

682
01:16:07,756 --> 01:16:08,883
What are you doing here?

683
01:16:08,925 --> 01:16:09,384
It's my job.

684
01:16:09,509 --> 01:16:10,677
Bullshit.

685
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:15,098
We've been up and down
this hill... nine fucking times.

686
01:16:15,098 --> 01:16:17,934
Hey, word down at Division is
you guys can't take this hill.

687
01:16:17,934 --> 01:16:22,271
What do you have to say about that?
In fact, Senator Kennedy says

688
01:16:22,397 --> 01:16:24,482
you guys don't have a chance at all.

689
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:29,530
You really like this shit, don't you?

690
01:16:30,531 --> 01:16:32,950
It's your job. A story.

691
01:16:33,033 --> 01:16:37,371
You're waiting here like a fucking vulture.
Watching for somebody to die, so you can take a picture.

692
01:16:37,496 --> 01:16:38,080
It's my job.

693
01:16:38,205 --> 01:16:40,791
I've got more respect for those little bastards up there.
At least they take a side.

694
01:16:41,458 --> 01:16:44,712
You just take pictures. You probably
don't even do your own fucking.

695
01:16:45,546 --> 01:16:46,630
No one ask my AO.

696
01:16:46,714 --> 01:16:47,548
What?

697
01:16:47,631 --> 01:16:49,133
You listen to me.

698
01:16:50,885 --> 01:16:53,471
We're gonna take this
fucking hill, Newsman.

699
01:16:54,305 --> 01:16:57,809
I see you on the top taking
pictures of any of my people

700
01:16:57,851 --> 01:17:00,437
I will blow your fucking head off.

701
01:17:01,396 --> 01:17:04,107
Now you haven't earned
the right to be here.

702
01:17:05,567 --> 01:17:07,152
Do you understand that?

703
01:17:09,821 --> 01:17:11,490
Understand that.

704
01:17:27,339 --> 01:17:29,508
I should have gone to Canada.

705
01:17:29,592 --> 01:17:31,845
All they got is Eskimo's up there,
Beenie.

706
01:17:32,429 --> 01:17:34,514
The smart white people go to college.

707
01:17:34,681 --> 01:17:39,436
Not me. I'm going my two years, getting married.
And forgetting all about this shit.

708
01:17:39,561 --> 01:17:40,270
Never happened.

709
01:17:42,356 --> 01:17:44,191
You people must be aware...

710
01:17:44,232 --> 01:17:49,613
that the brothers... are here. Because
they cannot afford an education.

711
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:52,575
What am I doing?

712
01:17:52,575 --> 01:17:57,622
Sitting in some... fucking country club
sipping on seven and sevens...
and eating a steak.

713
01:17:58,873 --> 01:18:01,709
Take a look around I see
all kinds of white faces here.

714
01:18:02,794 --> 01:18:07,298
Okay. The war Started for you...

715
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:09,801
when you farted...

716
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:13,639
and said good morning Vietnam.

717
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:17,309
See now I was born into this shit.

718
01:18:17,393 --> 01:18:20,771
And they pulled the gold fucking spoon...
out of mouth so I could come here.

719
01:18:20,896 --> 01:18:24,400
And see how you low Class
eleven boos live. Is that it?

720
01:18:53,597 --> 01:18:55,725
Brother Blood.

721
01:19:03,774 --> 01:19:05,276
Hey, how'd you get here, Sarge?

722
01:19:05,359 --> 01:19:08,696
Oh, the Sarge... the Sarge
volunteered for this shit.

723
01:19:10,322 --> 01:19:11,615
No, man.

724
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:16,496
I was drafted, sworn in... and had
my haircut before I was sober.

725
01:19:17,456 --> 01:19:19,958
The only reason I went
airborne is Collins.

726
01:19:20,167 --> 01:19:21,376
Who the fuck is Collins?

727
01:19:24,463 --> 01:19:27,132
We volunteered for the reality of it.

728
01:19:31,887 --> 01:19:35,266
Don't you think I chased woman and good time... before
I got into the green machine.

729
01:19:41,022 --> 01:19:47,779
We got our orders from the big puddle.
Collins says... he's not going.

730
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:50,073
And this one strac.
/You got to respect that.

731
01:19:51,908 --> 01:19:53,409
No way.

732
01:19:53,493 --> 01:19:56,914
If you don't want to pull
on the little people. No sweat.

733
01:19:57,498 --> 01:20:04,254
Don't use your weapon. All I want from
anybody is... to get their ass in the
grass with the rest of us.

734
01:20:05,547 --> 01:20:09,176
You don't have to like it.
But you have to show up.

735
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:16,851
No FNG's, no war.

736
01:20:23,233 --> 01:20:24,359
There it is.

737
01:20:46,882 --> 01:20:47,758
Medic!

738
01:20:47,883 --> 01:20:51,554
Doc... no! Doc!

739
01:21:06,069 --> 01:21:08,238
Hey you motherfuckers!

740
01:21:23,004 --> 01:21:25,089
Baletsky! Doc's hit!

741
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:27,341
No!

742
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:29,343
Baletsky! Gettim he's hit!

743
01:21:31,554 --> 01:21:34,432
Diggs! Diggs!

744
01:21:36,435 --> 01:21:39,938
Doc, he's dead! He's dead!

745
01:21:40,022 --> 01:21:40,773
O!

746
01:21:40,898 --> 01:21:46,612
Stay with me! Stay with me!
Stay with me!

747
01:21:47,446 --> 01:22:01,544
Gaigin, stay with me,
stay with me, stay...

748
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:19,647
C'mon on move!

749
01:22:26,153 --> 01:22:27,488
Keep going!

750
01:23:04,402 --> 01:23:06,195
Ain't get up!!!

751
01:24:32,035 --> 01:24:34,079
All right, let's you straight.

752
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:37,124
You've got a good one man.

753
01:24:38,542 --> 01:24:40,127
You're going home.

754
01:24:40,210 --> 01:24:41,879
See...

755
01:24:42,922 --> 01:24:44,465
See you at home.

756
01:24:49,971 --> 01:24:56,227
He's all right blood. I don't feel
a thing. I am boo koo doped up.

757
01:25:00,231 --> 01:25:04,903
Now, come on now. You owe
this to yourself, all right?

758
01:25:05,571 --> 01:25:11,577
Black Jack... won't be happy... 'til
he gets all my people... killed.

759
01:25:11,618 --> 01:25:14,163
Hey, how are you going to actman, how are you going to act?
You're going back to the real world.

760
01:25:14,204 --> 01:25:15,914
Going back, Doc.

761
01:25:16,999 --> 01:25:22,255
I'm just what the world needs.
Another nigger with a limp.

762
01:25:22,338 --> 01:25:24,507
Now come on, you stop that shit.

763
01:25:25,675 --> 01:25:28,261
I'm not omitting you, blood.

764
01:25:29,304 --> 01:25:35,685
We're all no good...
dumb niggers on this hill.

765
01:25:35,769 --> 01:25:40,523
Blood. And soul. Types.

766
01:25:43,402 --> 01:25:46,113
But we are going to fool
them this time, aren't we?

767
01:25:46,197 --> 01:25:48,783
Fucking A man. Fucking A.

768
01:25:48,866 --> 01:25:53,704
We've been up that hill... ten times...

769
01:25:54,372 --> 01:25:57,208
and they still don't think we're serious.

770
01:25:59,710 --> 01:26:00,878
Who are we?

771
01:26:00,878 --> 01:26:02,171
Hey Doc, come on.

772
