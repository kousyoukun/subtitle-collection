That all you got?

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,640
Hey man, l can't tell the difference
between incoming and outgoing.

Don't worry about it.

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,120
Hey man, l'm not worrying about it. l just think that it's 
important to know the signals for incoming rounds, all right?

81
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,480
Don't worry nobody's
getting in here tonight.

82
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,400
What's the signal for ground attack?

83
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,400
Three short ones.

Oh yeah, that's great for a night time,

86
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,760
Did you know that bird shit and paratroopers
are the only things that fall out of the sky?

87
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,400
Sarge. Are there any women here?

88
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,560

Some brother l was hanging out
with over at Delta company.

168
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,880
Drives iron raven.

169
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,880
Don't shit me, Sarge. Rumor has it
we're going back into the Ashau.

170
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,280
Shit.

171
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,120
Come on Sarge, man you know. l'm too short for that shit.
The Doc ain't gonna give me a profile.

172
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,480
Why don't you see if there's a job
for me over at headquarters.

173
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,240
They don't take niggers
back at headquarters, brother.

174
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,520
All the white mother
fuckers are back there.

175
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,120
Remove the protective
wrapping from the tooth brush.

176
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,960
Put the wrapping next
to your left foot.

177
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,480
Open the tooth paste with
the cap on top of wrapping.

178
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,800
Now put general amount of
paste on the sterile bristles.

179
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,200
People you will brush your teeth
in rapid verital motion for one minute.

180
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,080
That's up and down for
you rebel mother fucker.

181
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,000
When l say Start, you turn
to your right, you brush. Ready?

182
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Brush.

183
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,800
You may notice a granular taste.
That's pumice.

184
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,040
lt's puopse is to seal the teeth
and allow the flouride to penetrate.

185
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,000
Gentlemen, in Vietnam, you will be
confronted by many organisms.

186
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,640
ln food, water, air...
that are foreign to Amercan bodies.

187
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:55,240
Ringworm and Pataygo and Malaria,
ameobic dysentary and crotch rot.

188
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:02,680
lt has been found that proper dental hygene is important
component in maintaining of a healthy fighting man.

189
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,920
What are you doing?

190
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,800
Come on lighten up Bro.

191
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,440
l am not your brother.

192
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,040
Now did l tell you to spit?
/No, sir.

193
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,680
lf you wanna walk outta
this fucking place,

194
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,840
you will listen to people who know.

195
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:41,920
You be an individual, and l'll tagging your ugly toothless
face on it's way to a long box with metal handles.

196
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,640
Now brush your teeth in a
rapid vertical motion.

197
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,800
Troop!

198
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,640
Let's go!

199
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,240
Rise! Awake! Salute!

200
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,440
Another glorious morning.
You scroungy ass sons of bitches.

201
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,560
You found a home in the army,
Wortchester.

202
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,920
Hey thanks to hear you yong fellow.

203
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,080
Hey l'm low life of forty one
and wake up and out side of Vietnam,

204
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,880
Viet fucking green machine.

205
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,520
l'll probably be a fucking civilian with places to go,
people to see. Things to do.

206
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,000
l want you to keep on eye on these guys.
ln case we gotta go back to Ashau.

207
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,280
Don't mean nothing.

208
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,640
Man, don't these people
play no Tammy Wynette.

209
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,480
Did you sleep last night?

210
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,880
l kept seeing things.

211
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,200
What do you mean
you kept seeing things?

212
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,760
Did you sleep?

213
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,560
Did you hear something?

214
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,560
Oh this is bull shit.

215
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,720
You gotta sleep.

216
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,200
What are gonna do
stay hear for years?

217
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,760
All right, listen up.

218
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,840
You people are not dying
on me in combat.

219
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,680
You fucking, new guys will do
everything to prove me wrong.

220
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,440
You'll walk on trails, kickcans...sleep
on guard, smoke dope and diddely-bop...

221
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,120
through the bush like you were back
on the block.

222
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,640
On guard at night you'll write letters, play with your organ...
and think of your girl back home. Forget her.

223
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,720
Some hair head has her on her right now...
and is telling her to fuck for peace.

224
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,160
This is Han.

225
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,080
Those of you who are foolish will think
of him as...gook, slope, slant or dink.

226
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,240
He is your enemy.

227
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,920
He came over on the Chieu Hoi programme.
And he will go back there after he fattens on C-rations.

228
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,400
And he will be hunting your
young asss in the Ashau Valley.

229
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,280
Now forget about this Viet Cong shit.

230
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,880
What you'll encounter out there is...
hard core. NVA,north Vietnamese...

231
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,160
motivated, highly trained
and well equipped.

232
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,560
lf you meet Hanor his cousins,
you will give him respect.

233
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,640
And refer to those little bastards
as the Nathanial Victor.

234
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,000
Meet'em twice and survive, you will
call him mister Nathanial Victor.

235
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,840
People, l am tired...of filling
body bags with your dumb fucking mistakes.

236
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,960
Do you think this funny?

237
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,640
Alphabet.

238
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,000
Languilli.

239
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,480
Han is closing in on your position.
lt's night, look at me.

240
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,360
l'm gonna save your life
and your gonna save mine.

241
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,760
lt's night, it's raining.

242
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,640
While you're thinking about peace, 
love and whether or not we should be in Vietnam.

243
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,200
Han is going to cut your fucking throat. And your sleeping.
/No, Sergeant.

244
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,800
You've been humping the boonies for months.
Your turn to sleep, your allowed to sleep.

245
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,960
What do you think Han is going to do?
ls he going to wake up Alphabet and smile?

246
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,400
And talk about women?

247
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,640
Mister Nathanial Victor gets his
rocks off watching you die.

248
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,760
Some of you think you have problems
because your're against the war.

249
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,760
You demonstrated in school... you wear peace symbols on your steel.
And you have attitudes.

250
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,080
l'm orphan, my brother's queer, the city of
Chicago got the clap from my sister.

251
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,720
Mum drinks, Dad coughs blood.

252
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,000
l have ring worm, emersion
foot...the incurable crud

253
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,240
and the draught ruined my chances
of being a brain surge on people.

254
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,880
You have no problem.

255
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,080
Except me.

256
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,120
And him.

257
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,840
Hey, pal.

258
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,960
You know where l can
find general Rufferman?

259
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,360
Not friend of mine.
He is major genral, two stars.

260
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,840
l am supposed to deliver
this to trailer to him.

261
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,840
And l can't find anyone to sign for it.

262
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,760
Hey l'll sign for it.

263
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,600
l'm responsible for this.

264
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Well look at it.

265
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,760
Keepin the army forever to pay it off.

266
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,480
Everybody shoots at me.
Especially grunts.

267
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,760
l'm just rolling highway
sinder hunt and seek.

268
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,640
Listen, maybe you can
get a marine to sign for it.

269
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,800
Yeah. Yeah, thanks a lot.
Those guys are dancing.

270
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,400
This is one weird place.

271
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,280
Seventeen fucking wake up
and l'll never eat this shit again.

272
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,000
You hear what l'm saying sarge?
/We are in the army, man.

273
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,680
What are you gonna do when
you are back in the world?

274
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,480
l got places to go,
things to do, people to see.

275
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,160
Yeah but how are you gonna act?

276
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,760
Like a PFC, Private fucking civilian.

277
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,760
You are talkinig, you don't know
what you're saying, brother.

278
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,680
You ever heard of boony rap?

279
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,480
Fuck this, shit on that, no fucking way.

280

Look man, l got my act together. OK?

283
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,200
My shit's straight man.

284
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,400
You know a straighter and more intellegent brother
in first platoon then me?

285
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,760
Hey listen up, he's got college.

286
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,120
One time l went home
on special emergency leave,

287
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,440
My mama made me a
special meal man with

288
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,400
everything l love, l mean greens,
fresh vegetable, potatos, candies...

289
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,080
l happened to like baked ham.

290
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,440
So whole my family was there, and l said to myself, Motown
you got these people fooled.

291
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,440
l mean the day before that,
we were humping in Ashau valley,

292
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,840
and now l'm home with my family.

293
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,800
And l'm skatin man.
No problems. Number one.

294
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,960
l smile at my mama. Great meal, ma.

295
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,880
Would you please pass the fucking potatoes.

296
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,120
The ham is fucking A, ma.

297
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,040
You don't know how...how
fucking great it is to be home.

298
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,240
How you gonna act, huh?

299
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,800
You really want to know, Motown?

300
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,520
l'm gonna walk down Central Avenue.

301
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,480
My jump boots, my medals.

302
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,360
Shit, it's gonna be all right.

303
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,720
You'd better not wear your uniform.

304
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,400
Who's talking to you?

305
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:44,840
This man...has been fighting for the
fucking United States of white America.

306
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:51,320
And you going to try to advise him...
that he can't wear his jump boots.

307
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,800
You guys...don't know shit.

308
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,440
Commending General believes that
one of the most depressing problems

309
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,920
we face in Vietnam today
is Vineraal disease.

310
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,240
We have found the best way of contracting any one of
the nine known strands

311
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:30,520
of Syphilis, and or Gohnorrea is
to avoid contact with the indigenous.

312
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,840
Vietnamese female personnel.

313
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,760
However, remember, lie da
homo chai bokoo eeon.

314
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,600
Lie da homo chai bokoo eeon.

315
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,480
lt' the same anywhere Galvan.
You got to know the right words to score.

316
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,480
l'll go get us some shampoo.

317
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,120
Tafee.

318
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,560
What are you doing?

319
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,360
lt's called meditation.

320
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,640
How do you know
whether or not it's working?

321
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,680
lncoming!

322
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,840
Cold steel. Check point five...Two. Over.

323
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,360
Fire Major. Over.

324
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,160
Fire Major. Over.

325
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,400
They must have a
spotter in that tree line.

326
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,320
Fire! Standing by

327
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,640
Rounds out. Rounds out. Rounds out.

328
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,480
Cease fire. Cease fire!

329
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,720
Red 16. This is 16.
What's the situation. Over.

330
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,000
Red 16. This is 16.
What's the situation. Over.

331
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,240
Who is it?

332
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,680
How the hell do l know.
He's got no goddamn head.

333
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,960
lt's one of the new guys.

334
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,320
You got to tell these men to put an extra set of l.D.
tags on their boots one each.

335
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,640
Then this kind of shit wouldn't happen.
How the hell am l supposed to identify these people.

336
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,560
Now you take it easy, Doc.

337
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,240
l'll take it any way l can.

338
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,600
l've got to know who you are.

339
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,600
How's this. How's this?

340
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,480
Where's Gates?
He's in there all night.

/You ain't next!

343
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,120
l'm next, Doc.

344
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,520
l don't care what y'all say.
You got that life all you want.

345
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:06,200
Now we'll see, Goddammit.
l'm tired of all your shit.

346
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,280
Seven cards are squared.
Single titties are wild.

347
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,200
You say it boss.

348
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,760
Yeah, you could fart in a balloon and
paint it red and Marine would love it.

349
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,440
lt's true.

350
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,000
Your too big for her.

351
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,440
What's Elstavitz doing? Vinstock.

352
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,280
l don't know Sarge.
/You should.

353
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,800
ls he...

354
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,800
You white boys are strange about that.

355
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,680
Don't get lost Beanie. Wooahh.

356
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,520
Watcha doin' in Vietnam. Boy.

357
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,240
Volunteered, bro.

358
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,120
You know, the brothers
are here, because we're black.

359
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,200
They don't think we're educated.

360
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,440
That's bullshit.

361
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,040
Say what FNG? FNG?

362
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,960
Hey Andy, lack off, lack off!

363
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,600
My name isn't Alphabet. lt's Languilly, Vinny.
My first name is Vincent.

364
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,120
What's my name, Doc?

365
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,320
You're name is Vincent.

366
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,800
All right, get him outta here.

367
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:44,440
You Gl's are all...

368
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,480
You people will not
die on me in combat.

369
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,120
Galvin was good.
He always did everything right.

370
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,680
What difference does it make. We've been up and down
this same terrain since l got here. For what?

371
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,840
All right look.

372
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,760
When you get home.
You can throw your boots away.

373
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,920
Grow a beard, become
a Goddam hippie protestor.

374
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,760
l don't want to hear this shit.

375
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,120
Look, l know too many
Goddamm names, Wortchester.

376
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,440
And l don't think one of them is
worth all of Vietnam Republic of...

377
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,720
Look just don't fall apart on your people, Francz.
/Oh why not?

378
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,960
So l can teach 'em how to fill sand bags and burn shit.
/Hey!

379
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,160
They're gonna need you in
the Ashau. We're going back in.

380
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,240
What the hell you think

381
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,960

Negative contact. Over.

385
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,960
Yo Mire! Francz. Smitty!
Move these people out.

386
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,960
You'll do fine LT. Just fine.

387
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,720
These guys know
what they're doing.

388
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,240
Oh yeah, most definitely.

389
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,480

Did you see him?
/No.

405
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,320
We got a blood trail.

406
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,920
Find the little bastard.

407
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,720
You're on point.
/Me?

408
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,960
You've got no friendlies out there.
Got a full load.

409
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,600
Nathanial Victor. FNG type.
Walking around the Ashau

410
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,240
with a half a canteen,
that makes a lot of noise.

411
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,640
Where's the body?

412
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,560
Maggie Kung fleet foot, face full of
black soot talking at the heat put

413
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,600
plants in the bed but don't stop them
anyway. Maggie says all right.

414
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,400
Here it is, October 19th.
We have been here six months.

415
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,280
Now that's half way. All right?
Now l'm going to mark myself in blue.

416
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,640
But l got different color pens for everybody.
You can be red if you want to be. O.K.

417
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,960
But what l gotta know is did Washburn
get here the same day as us?

418
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,400
Yes.
/O.K.

419
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:48,000
And that other guy and alphabet the day before.
/Thank you sir.

420
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,480
Hey guys, check this out.

421
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,200
Love this Camaro.

422
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,160
lt's you. lt's a ride, man.

423
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,560
We did good today, didn't we?

424
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,560
We got our cherries busted
today, didn't we Sarge?

425
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,920
One of my people got killed.

426
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,200
That's all that happened today.

427
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,400
You knew that man wasn't going to
slack off because he was short.

428
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,200
You knew that brother
was going do his job.

429
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,160
Then why didn't you put him on profile.

430
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,280
Because...he is one healthy individual.

431
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:43,360
l've got people in this fucking platoon
who are so sick they wouldn't be allowed in the hospital.

432
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,040
But out here they have to
ruck up, move out and press on.

433
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,120
lt don't mean nothing, man.

434
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,560
lt don't mean nothing...

435
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,520
Come on, man...

436
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:58,240
You owe it to yourself...yourself.

437
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,520
lt don't mean nothing. Not a thing man.

438
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:30,400
lt don't mean nothing. Not a thing.

439
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:34,360
Right. You don't mean
nothing brother, not a thing.

440
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:40,720
lt don't mean nothing man,
not a thing. Nothing.

441
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:00,520
We got a.. we got McDaniels
body on a trailor truck.

442
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,080
All he wanted to do was go
home in his jump boots.

443
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,560
Couldn't believe they called him a jerk.

444
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,360
And worse.

445
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:24,720
Ya know, people get hurt out here.

446
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,960
C'mon. Don't tell me he died for God,
country and one-hundred
and first airborne...

447
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,800
Hey man, l'd never
say that shit to anybody.

448
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,840
Dan didn't die for anything.

449
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:39,000
He didn't leave his goddamn
guts on a goddamn trail in
goddamn Ashaw Valley.

450
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,040
For a home town medal
or any of that bullshit.

455
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,160
Battalion wants us to go back to
where Frantz made contact today.

456
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,880
They say there are some stragglers
left on this area Hill 937.

457
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,760
Those KlA's were clean and well
equipped. They weren't stragglers.

458
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:18,240
Military lntelligence says there is no organized...
Military lntelligence could fuck up a wet dream , sir.

459

All right man, let's call it. All right? We're on the same side here, right?

00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:05,060
They told us the way to cover an eye
in case the flareoes so that we lose our night vision?

490
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:05,860
They said that.

491
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,340
OK, so what they meant?

492
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,820
Does it matter if which eye we cover?

493
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:14,740
Good eye for the night vision
or the one for the flare.

494
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:19,780
Beletsky do you stay awake at night thing of
the things you should worry about?

495
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,140
What are you doing?

496
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,660
We were just having
some hot chocolate.

497
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,660
You here anything.
/Nothing.

498
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:44,100
Camp on the Delta Post.
Same same. Negative sit rep.

499
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,940
Looks like we're gettin' out
of here tomorrow.

500
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:48,740
l'm going straight to the PX
and ordering that Firebird.

501
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:51,820
What happened to the Camaro?

502
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:57,940
My dad won't drive
anything but a Buick.

503
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,740
Push in on the bullshit net.

504
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:10,700
What's the bullshit net?

505
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:11,940
Hanoi Hanna.

506
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:15,220
Best sounds in the valley.
And boy does she have a rap.

507
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,140
We love you too much...

508
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:20,420
drop your weapons and Uncle Ho
will give youa water buffalo...

509
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,580
your own rice paddy to shit in.

510
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:30,060
Sometimes they get American assholes...
to tell us what assholes we are.

511
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,380
No lie, man. lt's a trip.

512
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:37,540
American soldiers...and marines

513
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:43,020
embrace the heroic people of Vietnam...
like many of your heroic countrymen...

514
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,900
why fight the heroic
people's army...while your own

515
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:51,020
Government betrays you...and the heroic
American friends of Vietnam...

516
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,540
lf you have to smoke it at nigh
put a poncho over your head.

517
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:58,420
and l would like to send this special dedication...
to the Screaming Eagles in the Ashau Valley.

518
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:02,740
You may be killed any
time day or night...

519
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:06,180
like your shadow, death is following you...

520
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,020
Everywhere.

521
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:18,260
Bad dream.

522
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,540
How much am l supposed to
remember all this shit.

523
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:27,420
Panchos over your head,
no half canteens.

524
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:31,540
Dog tags on your boots.
Carry the claimor detonator while your setting them up.

525
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:34,420
Orange pills once a week,
whites daily, daily.

526
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:38,900
Oh don't ever walk on trails.
Boot in the sock. Harrows on the water.

527
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:42,260
Secure your frags.
And now, now this bullshit.

528
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,100
And the whole time, l'm worried
l might forget something.

529
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:14,100
All right, on your feet, wake up..

530
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:15,340
it's time to earn your combat pay.

531
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:17,060
Come on.
/Come on. Let's go.

532
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,140
Hey Motown, fuck you!

533
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,940
l need some goddamn boots, Sarge.

534
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:23,940
My whole fucking body hurts.

535
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,100
My dick hurts!

536
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,580
Then drop ten and beat it.

537
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,100
l don't want to hear
anymore of this shit.

538
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:31,340
Now you get your
head out of your asses.

539
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:34,060
Black Jack wants us to take this hill.

540
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,540
What's he going to do with it?

541
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:40,900
Pave it and turn it
into a goddamn parking lot.

542
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:42,580
Now move out.

543
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:59,220
Cold steel, cold steel
this is 1-6 alpha, over.

544
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,380
Tell 6 that the little bastards
have got some Claimors in the trees

545
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,540
And they're blowing the shit out of us.

546
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:04,100
So get us some goddamn fire support.

547
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:06,860
Cold steel, cold steel.
This is 1-6 alpha, over.

548
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:10,500
Come in 2-0

549
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,340
There wounded out could be
pressing fire from that bunk line.

550
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:13,460
pressing fire from that bunk line.

551
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:14,020
No shit.

552
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:16,140
Worcester, pull these men out.

553
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:19,380
Move it out! Move it out!!

554
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:27,620

555
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:32,900
My leg! Fuck!

556
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,380
You're mine! Mother fucker!

557
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,620
You fuckin' stink!

558
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:52,180
Tuffy!

559
00:57:58,740 --> 00:57:59,500
Watch out!

560
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:08,180
Clear this area Motown!
Cover it point blank!

561
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,780
Set up that gun!

562
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:13,260
Where's Doc?

563
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:18,220
Get him and the horn and tell him
we got his goddamn bunker!

564
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,500
Run the horn.

565
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:21,580
l can't hear you.

566
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:23,460

567
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,940
lt's 1-6 out there over!

568
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,660
C'mon, help me down there.

569
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:34,540
There's nothing wrong with you.

570
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:35,780
Get down there.

571
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,020
Talk to me! Talk to me!

572
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:45,420
Say Alphabet! Alphabet! Say it!

573
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:50,060
Cmon Tuffy! Tuffy! Say Alphabet!

574
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:16,700
Sarge,

575
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:20,580
l asked everybody who they think.

576
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:25,060
Nobody did it. Was it you?

577
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:26,900
Maybe he died of natural causes.

578
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:31,780
Half his head was blown away.

579
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:34,260
Sounds like a natural cause to me.

580
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:35,980
When can you get him out of here?

581
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:41,260
ln a boot coot fucked up dude from
the second squad ahead of Tuffy.

582
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:43,260
Hey, it don't mean nothing.

583
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:47,780
Where's my weapon?

584
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:24,020
We have taken the bunker

585
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:25,580
And are preparing to move up the hill.

586
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:26,980
All right. Worcester.

587
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:40,180
Let's move people
and take this fuckin' hill.

588
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:42,900
Let's go!

589
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:47,660
Get me some ammo!

590
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:52,180
Tuffy! l'm coming.

591
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:30,860
No. No cease fire.

592
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:37,180
Hold it up there firing
at our people. Hold it up!

593
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:55,060
Stop it! Man! God dammit!
Jesus Christ!

594
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:06,780
They said they are gonna
send some resupply today.

595
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:18,580
Get back on your horn and tell them we, our people,
need food and water now not later.

596
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:25,300
This is 16 alpha over.

597
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:33,500
Take a look at that map.

598
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:38,580
Sergent.

599
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:46,260
We are in Ashau valley.

600
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:50,340
and we ain't going no where
except back up to that goddamn hill.

601
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,340
l'll get you a map.

602
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:09,020
You put the tape in there
and you press that button.

603
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:12,300
lt's from my girl Claire.

604
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:13,540
Just don't use all my juice.

605
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:20,020
Now that's immoral, unjust and illegal.

606
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:21,260
Get this Beenie.
/What?

607
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:26,220
Oh my God! They're huge.

608
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:32,500
She likes to lie naked on the beach.
And have her boyfriend read the profit to her.

609
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:35,460
Oh yeah, he's probably
a long haired, foureyed faggot.

610
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:38,940
l just don't know what to say. l-

611
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:41,700
l don't know what time
it is where you are.

612
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:45,420
l'd like to wrap his
long hair around my body...

613
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:48,540
while he makes love
to me all night long.

614
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:51,060
l had dinner with your Mom and Dad.

615
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:55,020
We read all your letters and looked at
the pictures you sent.

616
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:59,300
She became his love prisoner.
She would do anything for him.

617
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:03,020
Jesus Christ, l'm never going to get another haircut
as long as l fucking live.

618
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:05,140
lf you can...Joe.

619
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:08,300
Try to smile more in the pictures.

620
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:10,140
lt would help your Mother.

621
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:12,540
Your dad didn't say much.

622
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:14,820
We both know what he's like.

623
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:20,100
Katherine says...he gets up
early every morning and...

624
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:24,940
watches the news. And he eats his
dinner in front of the TV at night.

625
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:27,180
l think he's looking for you.

626
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:33,580
l'm glad you have such good friends
like...like Bienstock and Langarelli.

627
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:34,940
Languilli.

628
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:36,980
Galvan and Frantz.

629
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:42,780
l, l want you to know one thing...

630
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:48,140
l'll always be true to you.
l'll wait for you.

631
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:52,740
l know it must be very difficult
for you over there and...

632
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:55,780
lf you can't be true...

633
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:59,620
if you can't wait...l'll understand.

634
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:02,100
l know you love me.

635
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:06,580
l love this woman,
she's telling him to get laid.

636
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:14,340
l wish you weren't there.
l wish none of you were there.

637
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:21,180
But l'm proud of you Joe.
l, l, l just don't think it's fair...

638
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:25,980
that everybody is back here...acting...
acting like nothing is going on.

639
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:30,540
Their lives are the same.
lt's just not fair.

640
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:34,500
And l don't believe
what they say about you.

641
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:37,340
Anyhow...

642
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:42,580
l don't care because l love all of you.

643
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:50,100
Especially you, my darling.
Especially you my...

644
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:54,620
Take it easy with that.

645
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:56,900
l'll take it anyway l can.

646
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:58,860
l told you not to use all the batteries.

647
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:03,340
lt's the goddamn nigger
music you listen to.

648
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:09,740
All right, come on. Break it up.

649
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:11,660
Alphabet, put shovel down.

650
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,540
Now what's happening here?

651
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:18,540
War's happening.

652
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:30,340

653
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:42,100
No! Fuck! Oh fuck! Doc!

Hey sarge, do you think they

lt's from my girlfriend.

671
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:30,140
She said she's not gonna write any more.

672
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:35,420
Friends at college told her it's immoral.

673
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:37,900
To write to me.

674
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:24,900

Okay, let's get ready,

682
01:12:30,340 --> 01:12:32,700
Teddy Ford. May 17.

683
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:38,540
How long have you been
on this hill, soldier?

684
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:41,540

685
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:46,180
Hey brother, how many times have you

686
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:47,820
What are you doing here?

687
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:48,300
lt's my job.

688
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:49,540
Bullshit.

689
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:53,740
We've been up and down
this hill...nine fucking times.

690
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:56,460
Hey, word down at Division is
you guys can't take this hill.

691
01:12:56,500 --> 01:13:00,660
What do you have to say about that?
ln fact, Senator Kennedy says

692
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:02,740
you guys don't have a chance at all.

693
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:07,620
You really like this shit, don't you?

694
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:10,900
lt's your job. A story.

695
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:15,140
You're waiting here like a fucking vulture.
Watching for somebody to die, so you can take a picture.

696
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:15,820
lt's my job.

697
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,380
l've got more respect for those little bastards up there.
At least they take a side.

698
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:22,140
You just take pictures. You probably
don't even do your own fucking.

699
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:23,980
No one ask my AO.

700
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:24,860
What?

701
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:26,380
You listen to me.

702
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:30,540
We're gonna take this
fucking hill, Newsman.

703
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:34,700
l see you on the top taking
pictures of any of my people

704
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:37,220
l will blow your fucking head off.

705
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:40,780
Now you haven't earned
the right to be here.

706
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:43,660
Do you understand that?

707
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:47,860
Understand that.

708
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:05,100
l should have gone to Canada.

709
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:07,380
All they got is Eskimo's up there,
Beenie.

710
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:09,940
The smart white people go to college.

711
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:14,620
Not me. l'm going my two years, getting married.
And forgetting all about this shit.

712
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:15,420
Never happened.

713
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:19,180
You people must be aware...

714
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:24,380
that the brothers...are here. Because
they cannot afford an education.

715
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:27,220
What am l doing?

716
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:32,060
Sitting in some...fucking country club
sipping on seven and sevens...
and eating a steak.

717
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:36,020
Take a look around l see
all kinds of white faces here.

718
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:41,340
Okay.The war Started for you...

719
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:43,780
when you farted...

720
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:47,420
and said good morning Vietnam.

721
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:50,940
See now l was born into this shit.

722
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:54,300
And they pulled the gold fucking spoon..
out of mouth so l could come here.

723
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:57,740
And see how you low Class
eleven boos live. ls that it?

724
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:27,820
Brother Blood.

725
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:36,980
Hey, how'd you get here, Sarge?

726
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:40,260
Oh, the Sarge...the Sarge
volunteered for this shit.

727
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:43,020
No, man.

728
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:47,700
l was drafted, sworn in...and had
my haircut before l was sober.

729
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:51,020
The only reason l went
airborne is Collins.

730
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:52,380
Who the fuck is Collins?

731
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:57,900
We volunteered for the reality of it.

732
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:05,700
Don't you think l chased woman and good time...before
l got into the green machine.

733
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:17,700
We got our orders from the big puddle.
Collins says...he's not going.

734
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:19,940
And this one strac.
/You got to respect that.

735
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:23,100
No way.

736
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:26,460
lf you don't want to pull
on the little people. No sweat.

737
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:33,540
Don't use your weapon. All l want from
anybody is...to get their ass in the
grass with the rest of us.

738
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:38,260
You don't have to like it.
But you have to show up.

739
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:45,580
No FNG's, no war.

740
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:52,820
There it is.

741
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:04,740

763
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:28,220
Black Jack...won't be happy...'til

764
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,700
Hey, how are you going to actman, how are you going to act?

01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:40,660
Now come on, you stop that shit.

768
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:44,260
l'm not omitting you, blood.

769
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:51,380
We're all no good...
dumb niggers on this hill.

770
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:55,980
Blood. And soul. Types.

771
01:21:58,740 --> 01:22:01,340
But we are going to fool
them this time, aren't we?

772
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:03,900
Fucking A man. Fucking A.

773
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:08,660
We've been up that hill...ten times...

774
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:12,020
and they still don't think we're serious.

775
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:15,500
Who are we?

776
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:16,740
Hey Doc, come on.

01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:23,180
Screaming Eagles, man.

781
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:27,780
Fucking buzzards.

782
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:32,060
Take the hill.

783
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:36,860
And those bastards back in the world...
can never take that from me.

784
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:43,740

Hold on man. Now you hold on

Sir, want a cup of coffee?

788
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:03,180

01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:09,860
l told him most of first
platoon was still on the hill.

790
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:16,300
We're not going anywhere, Sergeant.

01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:17,620
Drink your coffee.

792
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:24,260
Why did you keep coming back?

793
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:30,380
Ask me that when we're
back in the world

794
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:32,820
Drinking cold beer and
chasing hot women.
