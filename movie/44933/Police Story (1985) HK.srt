1
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:51,987
This is Chu Tu.
He's in his mid to late forties.

2
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:57,993
He's a nightclub owner, trader,
and property developer.

3
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:01,622
But we've found out all his companies
are losing money.

4
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:04,958
Hey, how are things up there?

5
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:08,337
This is Mad Wing, his bodyguard.

6
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:13,508
All of his employees
are actually hit men.

7
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,511
Be careful!
I'll see you at the dye factory.

8
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,347
Wait for me up there.

9
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,860
This is Danny Chu, his nephew. He's
always surrounded by bodyguards.

10
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:35,447
This is John Ko, the brains
behind Chu Tu's organisation.

11
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:42,079
This lady's name is Salina Fong.
She's only joined Chu Tu recently.

12
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:47,167
It's hard for us at this point to tell how much
she knows about Chu Tu's business.

13
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:56,176
Our mission is to arrest
all these drug dealers.

14
00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:00,138
The code name is Operation Boar Hunt.

15
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,724
- Have you got that?
- Yes, sir!

16
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,895
Read your orders.
You all have specific duties.

17
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:21,952
Memorize then destroy.
It's crucial that you stay in position.

18
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,748
Hurry, come on!

19
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,644
Attention. Attention.

20
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,523
This is strategic headquarters.
Begin the operation at once.

21
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,664
I'll get you a cup of milk tea.

22
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,711
- Two cups of milk tea, please!
- OK!

23
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,267
I'll be back for them.

24
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,481
There is a suspicious looking guy.

25
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,567
Two cups of milk tea, please!

26
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,945
Tell the others, I'll check it out.

27
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,996
- Big Mouth Kam!
- You have one cup for me?

28
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,332
- We've been discovered.
- What?!

29
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,792
Follow the guy in the red top.

30
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:48,390
What is it?

31
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,600
Salina here! Ah Kuen said there
are two suspicious guys here...

32
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,352
- What are you doing?
- Police!

33
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,062
Police harassment!

34
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,605
The police are here!

35
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,162
Freeze!

36
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,624
What's happening?

37
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,836
- They've opened fire!
- Let's break up the crowd first.

38
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,254
Leave this area now!

39
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,010
Crime squad.
Why is this happening?!

40
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,345
Police!
Get back into the house.

41
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,639
Go on! Hurry!

42
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:38,023
Listen! Watch out for civilians and explosives.
And be especially mindful of kids!

43
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:42,277
Hurry up, kid!
Get out of here!

44
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,968
- Move in and help.
- But we're supposed to stay put.

45
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:10,597
The situation's changed. Move it!

46
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,193
- Let me go!
- It gets tighter if you move.

47
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,319
Let me go!

48
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:41,419
Uncle, it's dangerous here! You leave first!
Quick, cover the boss!

49
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:03,483
There's a female suspect up there.
Take her back to the station.

50
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,655
It's
me!

51
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,912
- Why did they open fire?
- Don't ask me.

52
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,918
Calm down!

53
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,728
Tak! Cover me!

54
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,212
Tak!

55
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,510
You must stay calm.

56
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,605
Help me.

57
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,774
Don't get nervous.

58
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,248
They mean business!

59
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,295
Don't forget the warning.
Mind the villagers.

60
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,173
But will the bad guys
give a damn about them?

61
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,633
Why would we be cops, then?

62
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,134
Come here!

63
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,682
Be careful, Ka Kui.
They are fearless.

64
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,746
Boss! This way!

65
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,252
Get in!

66
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:32,382
You're blocking the road!
Get out of the way!

67
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,092
Reverse!

68
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:39,973
Not good, not good!

69
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:43,017
- You OK?
- This way's blocked, go back.

70
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,602
Go back! Quick!

71
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:48,940
Go back up!
The road below is blocked!

72
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:52,193
- We're stuck, boss! Now what?!
- We fight our way down!

73
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,611
Let's go!

74
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,144
Boss!
Get out of the car!

75
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,953
This way!

76
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,258
Freeze!

77
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,471
Stop shooting!
Mind the civilians!

78
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,932
Where have you been?
Isn't this your position?

79
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:49,519
- We went up to help.
- Who gave that order? They're gone!

80
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,272
What do you mean by that?

81
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,699
Hurry, go!

82
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,411
Let me borrow this!

83
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:09,580
Tell them to get down.
Don't let them see my face.

84
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,499
Tell the driver to step on it!

85
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,008
Get down!

86
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,678
Turn here, turn!

87
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,688
- Keep going!
- Keep going!

88
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,244
- Easy, boss, we'll make it.
- Look!

89
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:42,715
Get up there, and get rid of him.
Tell the driver to go faster!

90
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:56,562
Come down here and get him.

91
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,314
Come down!

92
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,455
Turn the bus! Go down the hill!

93
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,534
Are you nuts?
You're in the middle of the road!

94
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,077
Police. Stay back!

95
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,168
- Boss, the bastard's right in front!
- Run over him!

96
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,919
Step on it, run over him.

97
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,011
No need to be afraid!

98
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:40,791
Freeze!

99
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:46,088
You're under arrest,
but you have the right to...

100
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,674
If you let me go...

101
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,802
this is all yours.

102
00:16:56,557 --> 00:17:00,937
A once-in-a-three-lifetimes chance,
no one will ever find out.

103
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,067
Smart guy!

104
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,151
Stop!

105
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,288
Well done, you guys.

106
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:23,918
Act modest when he praises you.
Don't let it go to your head.

107
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:28,047
I'm used to this kind of stuff.
You'd better tell that to Ka Kui.

108
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:33,511
I didn't do it alone. It was a
success because of careful planning.

109
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:38,224
That's a great line. Don't forget
to say it when Raymond comes.

110
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,310
He'll be very happy to hear that.

111
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,400
Operation Boar Hunt
was carefully planned.

112
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,986
You were told to go in
and make the arrest.

113
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:53,364
You almost let the prime suspect
get away.

114
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,532
What happened?

115
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,534
Didn't Chou give you clear orders?

116
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,912
Yes, but he said the operation
was very well planned.

117
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,163
What?!

118
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:06,127
This operation was carefully planned.
But it had a few flaws.

119
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,004
Why were there flaws?

120
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,965
The flaws must have occurred
before we got to the store.

121
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,302
Ka Kui couldn't handle the secretary,
and she made a mess of things.

122
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:17,680
How could Chu Tu get away?
That was your post!

123
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,473
What do you mean by that?

124
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,685
Don't point your fingers
at each other.

125
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,395
- What?!
- The PR lady is here.

126
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,896
Show her in.

127
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,402
The press is here,
Superintendent Li.

128
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,613
- Tell them no comment!
- Hold it.

129
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:37,283
- I asked them to come.
- Then tell them to wait.

130
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:41,037
- Ka Kui, you'll be our spokesman.
- Me?!

131
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,291
- I can't possibly.
- The speech is ready, just read it.

132
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,627
Learn your lines
and don't botch them.

133
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,795
Inspector Man,
you can go now.

134
00:18:55,843 --> 00:19:00,389
The Chief is well pleased
with Ka Kui's performance.

135
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,183
They want to use him in PR.

136
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,978
After the speech, take him
to do a police recruitment poster.

137
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,898
And arrange for him to appear on TV.

138
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,232
In other words,
making him a role model?

139
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:13,152
The Chief thinks
he's a model policeman.

140
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,946
He'll be really good for it.

141
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,199
What are the charges on Salina?

142
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:22,620
Drug dealing, resisting arrest
and assaulting police officers.

143
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,706
- Drop all the charges.
- Really?!

144
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,963
You played a big part
in this operation.

145
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:38,010
The success of this operation
depended on skilful planning.

146
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,261
Good job.

147
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,055
Will you get a promotion?

148
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:45,351
As a police officer,
I don't fight crime to get promoted.

149
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,270
Our superiors
take care of promotions.

150
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,106
Did Chu Tu try to bribe you?

151
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:54,276
He sure did, with millions.
He could have bribed the whole force.

152
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,445
Just kidding! Don't put that down.

153
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,197
Can you two sit closer?

154
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:02,702
- What are you doing?
- Just saying hello.

155
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,120
Don't sit too close.

156
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,997
Let me sit here.

157
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,378
- He'll come this way, right?
- Yeah!

158
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,004
Let's start!

159
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,684
Straighten up your back.

160
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,644
Open your eyes a bit more.

161
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,980
Open your mouth. Wider.

162
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,232
Wider!

163
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:38,821
Forget it, just be yourself!

164
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,448
Ready?!

165
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,786
The handcuffs in the middle.
Try to be more energetic.

166
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:04,764
- Your plan wouldn't work.
- Why not?

167
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:09,393
She's Chu Tu's secretary.
She won't cooperate with us that easily.

168
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:12,021
Chu Tu's been arrested
and once he knows

169
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,900
his secretary is going to be
a witness, what will he do?

170
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,739
He'll do everything he can
to stop her appearing in court.

171
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:26,410
Whoever we send to protect her
will be in danger.

172
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:32,708
If you want to live to see 100,
don't become a cop.

173
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,629
Put that line
on one of our recruitment posters.

174
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,465
We don't have enough evidence to
prosecute him.

175
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:43,719
We must push him into a corner.
Then we can put him behind bars.

176
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,222
I'd like to suggest one person
to protect our lady witness.

177
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,141
I have someone in mind already.

178
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,268
Are we thinking of the same person?

179
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,318
Good luck to him.

180
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,822
I don't understand why you
were the only one freed on bail.

181
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:05,157
You're really lucky.

182
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:11,622
- They're here to see Superintendent Li.
- Please wait.

183
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,666
- Please wait.
- Right.

184
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,918
You can leave after you've seen him.

185
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:24,593
- You can go in now.
- Thanks!

186
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,891
Please sit down!

187
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,438
You can leave now, Miss Fong.

188
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:37,898
Wait a second.

189
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:42,444
Please keep this subpoena,
you'll need it to appear in court.

190
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,824
- What's the charge?
- Nothing!

191
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:50,077
But you'll be acting
as our witness.

192
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,956
I'm sorry!
My client isn't going to do that.

193
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:58,961
We're not asking her.
According to law, she can't refuse it.

194
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,758
- Inspector Chan!
- Yes, sir.

195
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:09,680
Your job is to protect Miss Fong
until she appears in court.

196
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,515
- Me? Protect her?
- Why not?

197
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,268
- Great!
- I don't need his protection.

198
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,605
As long as he doesn't harass you,
you can't refuse.

199
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:21,942
Inspector Chan.

200
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,528
As an escort of the witness,
you must be aware

201
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:28,616
that witnesses are often faced with
threat, disturbance and assault,

202
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:32,745
or irritated
by the intentions of such.

203
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:39,251
It is your duty to see her safety
and personal rights are intact.

204
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:42,463
Yes, sir!
But can you send someone else?

205
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,507
You'll get expenses
for this assignment.

206
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,176
$32.80 per day.

207
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,304
It's an old tradition,
unchanged for years.

208
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,223
Bring your own money.
That's all.

209
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:56,560
Can we talk to you alone, Miss Fong?

210
00:23:56,685 --> 00:24:00,731
My client doesn't answer questions
without the presence of her lawyer.

211
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,358
We won't ask her any questions.

212
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,986
This is not an interrogation,
just a few suggestions for her benefit.

213
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:14,787
- You have the right to refuse this.
- Let me see what they have to say.

214
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,374
Counsel Cheung!
Please excuse us.

215
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:26,382
You don't have to answer if they ask
you any questions about the case.

216
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,555
- Get out of here!
- I have to go, too?

217
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,057
You've got high rank?

218
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:20,477
What do you want to talk to me about?

219
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:25,691
Miss Fong, we have no further questions.
You can go now.

220
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,987
See you in court.

221
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:34,324
They're...
Let's go.

222
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,202
Ka Kui.

223
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,788
- Get it on tape if you can.
- OK.

224
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:43,375
- What did they say to you?
- They didn't say anything.

225
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:49,673
- I'm your lawyer, you can trust me.
- They didn't say a word to me.

226
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,803
- Why was it only her...
- They're coming!

227
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:01,310
- How's our boss?
- I can't bail him or the others out.

228
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:05,564
- What about Salina, then?
- She's their witness.

229
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:08,192
- What? Really?!
- They want me to do it.

230
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,194
You'd do that
just because they asked?

231
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,280
Stop bothering our witness!

232
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:17,034
- Who are you?
- I'm a cop!

233
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,328
My duty is to protect her.

234
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:23,499
If you don't stop your bullshit, I can charge
you with interfering with the police.

235
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:24,625
Salina...

236
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,753
You can only say
"see you" or "bye-bye".

237
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,255
One more word
and you're under arrest.

238
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:37,096
- I'll take you home.
- That's part of my job.

239
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:38,889
I'll tell them nothing!

240
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:46,146
- Now what, Counsel Cheung?
- I'll see your boss this afternoon.

241
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,940
All right! Let's go!

242
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,319
It's dangerous for you
to hang around outside.

243
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:56,281
- Let's go home, shall we?
- It's none of your business.

244
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:59,701
It's for your own safety.

245
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:03,455
I don't need your protection,
you parasite!

246
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,669
You know what happened to the
other four witnesses who said that?

247
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,003
What happened?

248
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:15,175
Were they shot? Don't try to
scare me. Tell me what happened.

249
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:17,845
You guessed right.
They're all actually okay.

250
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:22,808
- You have the right to say so.
- Scaring me?!

251
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:27,229
All the evidence
is against the defendants.

252
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,273
Only your situation is better.

253
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,692
We're depending on you,
Counsel Cheung.

254
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:32,943
I'll do my best.

255
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:36,613
You'd better be prepared for
bad news. The chances are slim.

256
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:40,534
If I walk away free,
you'll be rewarded.

257
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:46,039
There's still something
we need to worry about.

258
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:50,085
- Salina is their witness.
- Is she really?!

259
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,004
She's been granted bail.

260
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:55,924
The police even gave her a bodyguard,
the guy who arrested you.

261
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:02,055
Salina hasn't joined me that long.
She doesn't know much.

262
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:03,807
That doesn't concern me.

263
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:07,436
But she could say something bad
about us in court.

264
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:12,649
I don't think she would... All right.

265
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:19,740
Call Danny for me.
Tell him to take care of Salina.

266
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,533
All right.

267
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:28,332
- Thanks a lot!
- Keep the change!

268
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,499
See you later!

269
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:39,551
- It's dangerous to stay home alone.
- I like to see how dangerous it will be.

270
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:54,191
- John? I just got back.
- The phone is tapped.

271
00:28:55,984 --> 00:29:00,572
All right, I'll meet you later.

272
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,970
I'm really scared!

273
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,342
You think you can scare me like that?

274
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:49,348
Help!

275
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:58,982
Help!

276
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,609
I'm going to kill you!

277
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:12,162
You can't escape!

278
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,790
You're finished!

279
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,713
I'm going to kill you!

280
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,092
You're finished!

281
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:27,886
I'll get you!

282
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,726
I'm going to kill you!

283
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,208
Don't run away!

284
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,630
Can't escape now, can you?

285
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,258
You're finished!

286
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:23,191
There's no way out. You're finished.
I'm going to kill you!

287
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,073
Don't worry!
I'm here to rescue you!

288
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,081
She's terrified. Can I go now?

289
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:41,543
You can prepare to
leave now.

290
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,886
Hold on to him, I'll call the police.

291
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,607
The phone line!

292
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,861
Go now!

293
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,709
I knocked him out!

294
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:26,463
Not yet!
He's still conscious.

295
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:31,343
He's fighting me!
Keep away from us!

296
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:37,641
Please go now.
You can't stay here any longer.

297
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,188
He's passed out!

298
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,442
No! He's still conscious. See?

299
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:58,328
Please leave here right now!
Go now! Go on!

300
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,084
Go! Hurry!

301
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,171
Leave him to me!

302
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:16,054
- He's fainted.
- Let me hit him one more time!

303
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:21,142
If you smash his face,
we'll have a problem identifying him.

304
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:26,189
- But...
- I don't want to do this any more.

305
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,281
I don't know him.

306
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:38,785
- They'd use a stranger to kill you.
- Why kill me?

307
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:42,747
Of course,
Chu Tu's a ruthless man.

308
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:47,502
Inspector Chou, it's Ka Kui.
I just realized this is a tough case.

309
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:54,634
Can you send a replacement? No?!
I'm not risking my life for this job.

310
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:56,845
I might as well hire myself out
as a mercenary.

311
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:59,973
She?!
Let her fend for herself!

312
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,643
I quit!
Enough is enough!

313
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,815
- Where are you going?
- Home!

314
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:14,154
- You're supposed to protect me!
- But you're not cooperating.

315
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:21,661
- How do you want me to cooperate, then?
- It's too late! I quit.

316
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:32,505
I can't believe that
you cops have no sense of duty.

317
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:36,718
But there's nothing I can do.
If I stay here, we'll just die together.

318
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,138
I'll cooperate.

319
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,476
Don't feel forced.

320
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,021
I'm doing it of my own free will.

321
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,940
You should come to my house,
it's much safer there.

322
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:53,568
- Okay, let's go.
- Like this?

323
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:57,030
- I'll get changed!
- Chu's men could be back any time.

324
00:35:57,113 --> 00:36:00,158
I won't change my clothes, then.
Now what?

325
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,919
What is it?!

326
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,588
I'm checking
to see if everything's OK.

327
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,719
Go back!

328
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,472
You can come out.

329
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:32,148
- Why are you holding that?
- I'm holding the jacket for you.

330
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:33,733
I told you to put it on.

331
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:37,737
Follow me!

332
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,412
Use my car.

333
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:48,164
- All these cars are yours?
- No, it's that one.

334
00:36:56,214 --> 00:37:01,094
- Why are you not nervous at all?
- I'm used to situations like this.

335
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:05,390
- I told you to stay quiet, didn't I?
- Now what?

336
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,060
- Are you all right?
- My son!

337
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:13,231
Close the car door!

338
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:58,860
It's me! Give me my gun!

339
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,327
It's in my jacket pocket.

340
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,085
Help!

341
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,137
I've got you!

342
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,148
Freeze!

343
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,194
Freeze!

344
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,365
Stay calm!
Give me the gun.

345
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,617
- Stay calm!
- Keep away!

346
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,920
Give me the gun!
It's me!

347
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:14,185
- Are you all right?
- Where are they?

348
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,312
You scared them off with that shot.

349
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:20,024
We must get you away from here,
those guys are for real.

350
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:23,528
For real?
What about before?

351
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:27,448
That was real too,
but this is more real.

352
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:30,994
- So that's why you're more nervous.
- Get in the car.

353
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:45,675
- So you are capable of crying?
- I didn't expect that Uncle Tu would treat me like this.

354
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:50,221
Don't be naive.
People like him are capable of anything.

355
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:53,224
Evil to the bone! He'll see to it that you
won't be in court.

356
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,517
What should I do then?

357
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,562
Speak out in court tomorrow.

358
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,815
Put him in jail,
and you'll be safe.

359
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,526
Speak out about what, exactly?

360
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:07,447
What business he's in,
who his contacts are,

361
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:09,866
the number of drug deals.

362
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,535
Why are you taping this?

363
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:16,706
It's my way of taking notes.
When did you start working for him?

364
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,082
Four years ago.

365
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:24,964
He's a family friend. Mom said he always
lent us money to buy milk powder.

366
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:30,386
- So now you help him sell drug powder.
- I know very little.

367
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,889
Then just tell what you know.

368
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,688
Anything else you want to add,
tell me later upstairs.

369
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:43,650
Have I said enough
to put him away?

370
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:47,862
I'm not the prosecutor,
but what you've said will be useful.

371
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,454
Come in.

372
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,831
Here.

373
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,377
Let me turn on the lights.

374
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:10,009
It's May.
I almost forgot today's my birthday.

375
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,180
Are you all right?

376
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,606
Let me introduce you,
this is Miss Fong.

377
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:38,538
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. May!

378
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,962
They've all gone?
That was quick!

379
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,338
It's all my fault.

380
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:50,800
She wanted to surprise you,
but you brought a girl home.

381
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,970
And I'm dressed like this.
Of course she's angry.

382
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:58,474
I can be angry too!
Wouldn't even let me explain.

383
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,810
Left me the whole cake.

384
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:03,438
This time I won't forgive her,
even if she calls me back.

385
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,982
I don't think she will.

386
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,319
I knew she would be back!

387
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,784
Happy birthday!

388
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,953
What's so happy about it?

389
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,122
Why did May fly out in such a rage?

390
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:25,209
- She saw me bring home the female witness.
- I'll go and explain to her.

391
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:29,464
No need.
Have her reflect on her faults.

392
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:34,677
I have to explain to my boss.
I have to explain to the suspect.

393
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:36,220
I'm sick and tired of explaining!

394
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:39,682
Do you want some cake?
Something to drink?

395
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:42,477
- Orange juice, please!
- Help yourself!

396
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,569
You live by yourself?

397
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:54,155
So that the ICAC can investigate how
I can afford such a big place?

398
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,866
I share it with my friend,
but he's on holiday.

399
00:42:56,949 --> 00:43:00,286
I'm really sorry.
Your girlfriend must be angry with me.

400
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:04,540
Never mind that.
It's all part of the job.

401
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,671
Come on! Come in!

402
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,133
You'll be all right. I'm leaving.

403
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:15,635
See you!

404
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,309
I'm just a cop now.

405
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:27,772
But I might become a movie star
and have to kiss ladies passionately.

406
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,315
She'd have to hang herself
three times a day!

407
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:37,490
She's jealous because she loves you.
I'll explain to her if I can.

408
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:41,077
What for? She's such a narrow-minded girl,
it'll only spoil her.

409
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:44,330
Aren't you going to think of
something nice to say to her?

410
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:50,169
Not a chance. If I started sweet-talking,
girls would be queuing from here to Tsim Sha Tsui.

411
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:53,047
She'd have to wait her turn.

412
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,510
Don't you like her?

413
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,179
To be honest,
I do love her a lot!

414
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:04,684
But that's no reason
for me to apologize to a girl.

415
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:08,980
I know she's going to call back
to say how sorry she is.

416
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,983
What a waste.

417
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:26,038
See? Can't get home fast enough,
now she's probably calling from the street.

418
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,875
Hello? Hello?

419
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:34,797
- Is that your girlfriend?
- Yes. She's speechless with tears.

420
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:39,427
There's no use crying.
You should have behaved yourself.

421
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,514
What misunderstanding?! If I was protecting
a man, you'd think I was gay.

422
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:46,309
Go and reflect on your faults.

423
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,811
- Let me explain to her.
- No need!

424
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:52,106
You need to promise
to control your temper.

425
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:55,818
Show me some respect in front of my friends.
Stop crying. Bye-bye!

426
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:58,654
I had to use this opportunity
to teach her a lesson.

427
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:14,462
- When did she come in?
- When you said she would hang herself three times.

428
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,340
So she heard everything?

429
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:18,591
The phone call.

430
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:30,436
What a dirty trick.

431
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,563
May! May!

432
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:39,946
Let me explain. She's our witness,
my job is to protect her.

433
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:42,114
I'm not angry about that.
I'm angry about what you just said!

434
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,535
You know I was only kidding.
I always call first whenever we have a fight, don't I?

435
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:51,082
You insulted me in front of another girl!
You made me lose face!

436
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:54,961
- Go away!
- Please listen to me! May!

437
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:02,635
- Are you all right?
- Go away! Happy now? It hurts.

438
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,679
Not happy!
My heart's hurting.

439
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:09,225
I'll get the shoes for you.
Put them on first.

440
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,518
Go away!

441
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,229
- Please listen to me!
- No, I don't want to!

442
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:19,568
- Listen to me, will you?
- Let go!

443
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,996
- I hate you!
- Be careful.

444
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:05,364
Where's your girlfriend?

445
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:09,327
I accepted her apology,
so she went home happy.

446
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:12,830
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

447
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:16,417
It hurts.

448
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:20,588
It's breaking! Easy!
It's breaking!

449
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:26,010
What is this ugly thing?
Get rid of it.

450
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:28,637
What? Get rid of it?
This is my precious.

451
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:37,188
You got me all wet!

452
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,856
I'll wipe it off for you.

453
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:45,029
It's ticklish! No, don't!
Not there, here.

454
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,572
- Here?!
- Yeah!

455
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:50,826
Be gentle!
You're so rough.

456
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:02,171
This sofa is so uncomfortable.
Can we go to bed?

457
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:04,799
Okay, going to bed is good.

458
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:07,802
- But where can I sleep?
- On my bed.

459
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:10,971
- And you?
- Next to you.

460
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:15,142
Using such a method to protect me.
I like it.

461
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,910
I'm going to sleep now.

462
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,453
Don't disturb me.

463
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:39,083
Women are strange!

464
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:58,436
Ka Kui? Wait a second.
Uncle Bill, it's him.

465
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,774
- Hurry, they're waiting at the court.
- He's out already. Maybe there's a jam.

466
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:08,571
Stop pretending! Hurry!
Bring the witness.

467
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,209
What was your duty on that day?

468
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:25,796
I was observing the squatter huts
behind the site.

469
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,132
There were about
a dozen suspects getting away.

470
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,925
I arrested the sixth
and seventh defendants.

471
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:30,593
Thank you!

472
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:34,096
Can I ask the witness a question?

473
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:40,478
Mr Kam, you said you saw a
dozen suspects escaping.

474
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:44,190
Did all 13 suspects
pass in front of you one by one,

475
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:47,735
or did you have a new electronic device

476
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:51,906
that let you see
all the action at once?

477
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:57,328
I object! The question twists the witness's
statement to undermine his credibility.

478
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:58,496
Overruled!

479
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,499
Thank you!
No more questions!

480
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,502
Call the next witness
for the prosecution.

481
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:29,443
- You took my spot!
- I'm in a hurry!

482
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,947
Stayed here any longer,
and I'd kick your ass!

483
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:36,325
Nice parking, though.

484
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:50,673
What?! She's gone?
What kind of bodyguard are you?

485
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:53,551
- Now what? I can't imagine.
- We'll lose for sure.

486
00:50:53,884 --> 00:51:00,099
How could you be so sure that one of
the escaping suspects was my client?

487
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,685
He had the same clothes.

488
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:06,814
In other words, you didn't have a
clear view of the suspects' faces.

489
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,899
You could say that.

490
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,861
- Are you short-sighted?
- No, I'm not.

491
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:15,281
All right.
No more questions.

492
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,367
Next witness.

493
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:35,968
I swear to tell the truth.

494
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:53,694
I was at the squatter huts
for the operation.

495
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:57,740
The first, second, third
and fourth defendants opened fire.

496
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,325
I saw them jump on a bus.

497
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:02,161
So I took a short cut
and went down the hill.

498
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:06,582
A citizen helped me
to stop the bus with his car.

499
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:11,503
After the bus stopped,
I arrested the first defendant.

500
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:14,506
He tried to bribe me, but I refused.

501
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:15,674
That'll do.

502
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:18,510
That was very clear.
Thank you!

503
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:24,183
Inspector Chan,
you said you were at the squatter house.

504
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:26,477
- What time was that?
- About 6:00 am.

505
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:28,854
- What time exactly?
- 5:55 am.

506
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,272
Let's say 6:00 am.

507
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:36,278
In December in Hong Kong, do you know
that sunrise is at 6:23 am?

508
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:37,696
I didn't know.

509
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:39,657
- Is that true?
- How would I know?

510
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:43,202
Do you know the saying
"Darkness before dawn"?

511
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,286
No, I don't.

512
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:50,250
The saying means that it's dark
before the sun rises.

513
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:52,670
- I might have heard of it.
- All right.

514
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:55,172
If there wasn't much light,

515
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:59,259
should we believe
you could actually see my client?

516
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:02,388
Believe it or not, it's your business.
You shouldn't ask me.

517
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:07,226
You said you ran down the hill
to stop the bus.

518
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:12,898
- Did or did you not lose sight of the bus?
- I did not.

519
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,692
- Why hesitate?
- I want to be sure.

520
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:17,027
- You have doubts?!
- I object.

521
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:21,240
Sustained. The witness should be sure
of his answer.

522
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:24,201
How long did it take you
to go down the hill?

523
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:27,162
And was the bus always in sight?

524
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:30,791
For a while my view
was blocked by the hill.

525
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:36,338
Could it be that another bus
overtook the first one at that point?

526
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:38,924
- There was only one bus!
- You're lying!

527
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:39,883
I object!

528
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:43,929
Sustained!
Defense should rephrase his question.

529
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:47,391
- So are you lying?
- No!

530
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:51,562
There are four different bus routes
on that road.

531
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:55,399
On two routes,
the buses run every five minutes.

532
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:58,068
On the other two,
the buses run every six minutes.

533
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:01,905
So 88 buses run back and forth
on that road every hour.

534
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:06,118
- That's more than one bus a minute.
- I didn't know.

535
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:09,747
How long did it take you
to go down the hill?

536
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:11,206
About two minutes.

537
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,292
- Can you be more precise?
- Two and a half minutes.

538
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:17,004
50 two or three buses would have gone by,
maybe as many as seven or eight!

539
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:20,090
But you said there was one.
I say you're lying.

540
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:22,885
Haven't you ever waited for a bus
for half an hour?

541
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:32,019
All right. Let's give you
the benefit of the doubt.

542
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:36,523
Assume there was one bus
and you could see it all the time.

543
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:40,068
Which part was clearly visible
to you?

544
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:42,237
- The body.
- How much of the body?

545
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,907
- All of it!
- You're lying!

546
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:47,826
What's he doing?

547
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:52,790
You could see only one side of
this bus. At most, only half of it.

548
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:56,210
You couldn't see the other half.

549
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:58,170
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

550
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:03,383
And anything could have happened
on the side you couldn't see.

551
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:08,096
So if someone jumped off,
you couldn't see him, could you?

552
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,641
- No.
- Speak louder.

553
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:13,018
I could have jumped off, he couldn't.

554
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:15,187
Just answer the question.

555
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:18,857
You think just anyone
can jump off a bus?

556
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,109
Inspector Chan,
calm down please!

557
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:23,862
- Why did he want to bribe me, then?
- How did he bribe you?

558
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,532
He said I could have
the case of money if I let him go.

559
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:31,203
If it was you and someone pointed
a gun at you, what would you do?

560
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,414
Objection overruled!
Answer him!

561
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:39,878
- I'd give him all my money.
- That's what happened to my client.

562
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:43,340
- Am I right?
- No, I'd already identified myself.

563
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:46,677
There are many cases where
criminals pose as policemen.

564
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,011
I object!

565
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:49,805
Sustained!

566
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:53,934
Court will ignore that remark.
Confine yourself to this case.

567
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,435
I'm sorry!

568
00:55:55,519 --> 00:56:00,399
Consider this, a businessman is
carrying company cash on a bus.

569
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:04,862
A policeman chasing robbers stops
the bus and points a gun at him.

570
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:07,865
So the businessman thinks
the policeman is a crook.

571
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:12,077
So he tells the policeman
to take the cash and let him go.

572
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,621
Inspector Chan,
isn't that right?

573
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:20,669
The witness doesn't
need to answer.

574
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:26,592
We already know the answer. He
doesn't need to say it. I conclude.

575
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,306
Wonderful!

576
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:34,016
- Now what?
- I know what to do.

577
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,852
- It's not fair to let him go free.
- Of course.

578
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:44,276
Your Honor, we request
an adjournment.

579
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:46,028
Our prime witness was delayed.

580
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:48,697
The Crown has failed
to establish a case.

581
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:52,242
There is insufficient evidence
to convict my client.

582
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:54,870
- I request a dismissal.
- Your Honor.

583
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:58,040
We have taped evidence
from our witness.

584
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:00,292
Tapes can't be accepted as evidence.

585
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,210
That tape is key to this case.

586
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:07,591
I will not adjourn or postpone
the hearing.

587
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,260
That would be unfair
to the defendant.

588
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:14,181
I will grant him bail.
But we will hear that tape first.

589
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,475
This case is not over yet.

590
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:29,821
Please turn up the volume.
It was taped with a small recorder.

591
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:58,934
It's an old tape, Your Honor.
Please keep listening.

592
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:01,937
It's coming up!

593
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,027
What are you doing?

594
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:13,115
- Nothing.
- It hurts.

595
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:18,912
It’s breaking! Easy!
It’s breaking!

596
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:24,376
- What is this ugly thing? Get rid of it.
- This is my precious.

597
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:25,919
It's only a cactus!

598
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:30,048
You got me all wet!

599
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:35,262
- I'll wipe it off for you.
- It’s ticklish! No, don't!

600
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:38,181
I spilled the orange juice!

601
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:43,061
It wasn't what you think.

602
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:50,736
This sofa is so uncomfortable.
Can we go to bed?

603
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:53,947
- Okay, going to bed is good.
- But where can I sleep?

604
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:55,615
On my bed.

605
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:58,493
- And you?
- Next to you.

606
00:58:58,577 --> 00:59:01,246
Using such a method to protect me...

607
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:05,751
Come on!

608
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:12,466
Don't get too close.

609
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,385
No photographs!

610
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:16,928
Ka Kui!

611
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:21,933
Give me a report of the whole case.

612
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,643
Yes, sir.

613
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:25,979
Boss!

614
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:28,398
No pictures!

615
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:38,075
John, reserve a room
at the country club

616
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,078
so that we can
make a toast to justice.

617
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:46,041
- I'm leaving now.
- Thank you very much!

618
00:59:57,469 --> 01:00:00,555
Next time let's hire him
as prosecutor.

619
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:05,811
This is Crime Story.
I’m so happy to see you all again.

620
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:10,148
Our guest today is
a brave police officer.

621
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:14,903
Sitting next to me is
Inspector Chan Ka Kui.

622
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:17,823
- Hello!
- Hello! Hello everyone!

623
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:22,702
After cracking a big drug case,

624
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:26,373
you’ve become very popular
among the people.

625
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:30,418
Would you share this particular
experience with us?

626
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:36,466
The success of this operation
was due to teamwork.

627
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,135
I was just a part of it.

628
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,971
We were well prepared for
the operation.

629
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:45,851
What makes your department so special
in the police force?

630
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:51,982
To be one of us, you have to be
strong, alert, smart, and...

631
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:54,818
- Boss.
- What's up?!

632
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:59,573
His photo is all over
the papers and magazines.

633
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:03,368
He's even been nominated
for some awards.

634
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,543
BRAVE POLICEMAN
ARRESTS DRUG TYCOON

635
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:16,339
And our Thai source is out of stock.

636
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:18,592
Why?
They've all changed jobs?

637
01:01:18,717 --> 01:01:22,596
No, but all the goods
have gone to Uncle Seven.

638
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,306
They want cash.

639
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:27,934
Boss, Counsel Cheung is here.

640
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:30,103
Please come in.

641
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:34,858
Mr Chu, I've received your check.
Thanks a lot!

642
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,610
I should thank you!

643
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:39,112
How's my case now?

644
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:44,242
All evidence must remain
with the court until the case ends.

645
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,077
That means I can't get
my stuff back yet?

646
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:50,624
Your passport and bank account.
You can't use them now.

647
01:01:50,749 --> 01:01:54,544
If you're found guilty,
your assets will be confiscated.

648
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:57,881
I won't even have
enough money to escape.

649
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:01,468
- Phone call for you, boss.
- Excuse me!

650
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,181
Salina.

651
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:08,975
It's boring here.
I want to go somewhere else.

652
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,435
Not just yet.

653
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,313
- Can I come and see you?
- Not now.

654
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:15,357
You should stay where you are.

655
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:17,567
The police are looking for you.

656
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:20,153
I'm planning a trip to Europe for you.

657
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:23,156
Once you're there, you'll be fine.

658
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,158
You just have to wait.

659
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:27,160
It’s for your own good.

660
01:02:31,373 --> 01:02:33,959
Hello? Hello?

661
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:42,926
- Where were we?
- We were lucky to bail you out.

662
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:46,972
It would have been different
if they had found Salina.

663
01:02:47,097 --> 01:02:50,058
I doubt they'll ever
be able to find her.

664
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:53,478
Very well. I must leave. See you.

665
01:02:56,648 --> 01:02:58,775
Counsel Cheung is right.

666
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:02,612
Salina's a big problem.
You can't hide her forever.

667
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:08,702
Snake Eyes says that that stupid cop
is looking for Salina everywhere.

668
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:13,039
- We should send her abroad.
- She must never return.

669
01:03:14,374 --> 01:03:18,295
Let's use that stupid cop
to kill Salina.

670
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,759
There are lots of other
beautiful girls, Boss.

671
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:27,637
We've got all those beauty pageants
in Hong Kong every year.

672
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:32,434
Inspector Man wants to see you.

673
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:33,852
Let him in.

674
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:36,438
We paid him, didn't we?

675
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:41,276
Paid him $100,000. But he says he wants
to retire and start a business.

676
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:44,029
- What does that mean?
- He wants more money!

677
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:46,156
This way, Inspector Man.

678
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,616
- Inspector Man.
- Mr. Chu.

679
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,243
- Sit down.
- I'm OK.

680
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:53,705
- I came to see you about...
- Yes, I know.

681
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:57,375
You want to retire
and start a business. Good idea.

682
01:03:57,459 --> 01:04:02,005
- Thank you.
- I know you're a smart guy.

683
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:05,467
- But I want one more favor.
- What is it?

684
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:08,887
I want that brave cop
to disappear for good.

685
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:21,316
You want glory,
I'll give you glory.

686
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:53,681
I'll book you for that!

687
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:55,016
SUPERINTENDENT

688
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:58,686
- 1985, come on patrol with me.
- Yes, sir!

689
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,105
Inspector Chan!

690
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:02,982
If anything happens - usually not -
you can reach me...

691
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:04,067
By calling you on the radio?

692
01:05:04,192 --> 01:05:06,569
- Call me at home.
- But you'll be on patrol.

693
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:10,615
But I can pass by my house
even though I'm on patrol.

694
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,001
Colleague!

695
01:05:22,377 --> 01:05:25,672
I need to go to the toilet,
you stay here.

696
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,882
Don't break it.

697
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,512
Sha Tau Kok Station.

698
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:34,681
You called me,
Inspector Chan?

699
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:37,308
Of course,
any information?

700
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:41,980
On Salina? I need more time.
It's a tough job.

701
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:44,315
Tough? Tough to get paid too.

702
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:47,402
I will do it.
I'll do my best.

703
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:50,488
What? Wait a second!

704
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:54,868
Sha Tau Kok Station, wait.

705
01:05:56,494 --> 01:06:00,999
- I'll give you three days, Snake Eyes.
- Three days?

706
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:04,377
That's not enough time.

707
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:06,629
What, more?
Four days, then.

708
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:09,883
If I get transferred back to Kowloon,
you'll be in trouble.

709
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:12,135
That's it for now.
That's it for now!

710
01:06:15,013 --> 01:06:18,516
- Who are you looking for?
- How dare you talk to me like that, Ka Kui!

711
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:22,479
You want to speak to Inspector Chan?
Hold on.

712
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:26,566
- Your call, Inspector Chan.
- Right, thanks!

713
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:31,529
- Hello, who are you looking for?
- This is May.

714
01:06:31,613 --> 01:06:36,284
- Who was that rude guy?
- Yeah, he's quite impolite. Let me scold him.

715
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:40,538
Lau, didn't I tell you to be polite
on the phone?! You're so rude!

716
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:42,790
I'm sorry,
Inspector Chan's friend.

717
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:45,376
Okay.
I've scolded him.

718
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:48,254
- What is it, May?
- What are you doing now?

719
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:52,175
Me? I'm speaking to you
on the phone.

720
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:54,677
- Have you eaten yet?
- Not yet.

721
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:56,638
I'm cooking some
instant noodles.

722
01:06:56,763 --> 01:06:59,265
- Have you eaten, then?
- No.

723
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:02,977
Wait a minute.

724
01:07:04,312 --> 01:07:06,189
Sha Tau Kok Station, hold on.

725
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:09,150
May?

726
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:11,903
Mom wants to have you over for dinner.
Are you free on Sunday?

727
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:15,031
Is that so? Any time.

728
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:17,033
- Sha Tau Kok Station.
- My husband beat me up!

729
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:19,536
- What? What about your husband?
- He beat me up!

730
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:23,289
- Who's beating who up?
- My husband’s beating me up!

731
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:27,710
Don't cry. I'll put you through
to a different department.

732
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:31,506
May, I'm free on Sunday.
Don't hang up.

733
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:33,925
The line's busy.
I'm still connecting you.

734
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:36,010
Sha Tau Kok Station, speak up.

735
01:07:36,094 --> 01:07:37,762
I ’ve lost a cow.

736
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:42,892
I'll connect you to Missing Persons.
The line's still busy.

737
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:44,727
- Sha Tau Kok Station.
- I was raped!

738
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:47,438
What? You've been raped?
I have to write down the details.

739
01:07:52,944 --> 01:07:54,529
When were you raped?

740
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:57,031
I wasn’t raped,
I was beaten up by my husband!

741
01:07:57,115 --> 01:08:00,159
Oh! It's you,
I'm still connecting your call.

742
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:03,621
- It’s taking so long!
- It's a big police station. Be patient.

743
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,208
Who's been raped?

744
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:09,210
- Me!
- I’ve lost a cow!

745
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:10,878
The cow has to wait.

746
01:08:10,962 --> 01:08:13,548
- When were you raped?
- Last year!

747
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:15,592
Last year?
Why report it now?

748
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:19,345
- Are there any morning after pills I can take?
- Pills?!

749
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:21,097
I'll find out for you.

750
01:08:21,389 --> 01:08:24,559
- Hello, Missing Persons Department.
- I've lost a cow.

751
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:28,938
Bring in a photo of the cow,
and I'll help you find it.

752
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:38,615
May, I'm very busy. She wants me
to name a place for dinner?

753
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:40,491
Give me a minute first.

754
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:45,455
- Where shall we go?
- The Family Planning Clinic.

755
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:48,916
Tell her to take double portions.
It's free.

756
01:08:50,418 --> 01:08:51,502
May?

757
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:54,088
Tell my mom to take pills?
Give it to your mom instead!

758
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:56,090
What?! May!

759
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:59,385
Tell my mom to take the pills?

760
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:01,888
Hello? Hello?

761
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:14,692
Tell my mom to take the pills?
She isn't pregnant.

762
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:32,979
- Sha Tau Kok Station.
- This is a test by the telephone company.

763
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:34,230
Testing the phone?

764
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:51,873
- Was there a traffic jam again?
- No, not a traffic jam.

765
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:53,249
Then why?

766
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:56,669
If there was a jam,
I wouldn't be here yet.

767
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:58,963
You knew we are having
dinner today at my place.

768
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:00,548
My mom hates people
who are late.

769
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:04,302
I've been waiting several days
for Snake Eyes to phone.

770
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:07,054
You're off that case.
It's no longer your business.

771
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:08,389
Not my business?

772
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:12,393
Let me return this call first.

773
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:15,271
Hold on to the car.

774
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:18,566
The hand brake is broken.
Hold on to it.

775
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,996
It's me, Snake Eyes.

776
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:36,793
Chu Tu's hiding that witness you're
looking for in his villa at Rosary Village.

777
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:39,545
Where?

778
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:43,508
Hurry up, or Chu Tu will
kill her any minute now.

779
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:44,842
No kidding?

780
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:47,762
I wouldn't kid you. Hurry.

781
01:11:52,517 --> 01:11:53,518
Don't tell me you're cancelling!

782
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:57,313
Chu's going to kill the witness.
I have to go and rescue her.

783
01:11:57,897 --> 01:11:59,106
Don't go!

784
01:11:59,232 --> 01:12:02,485
If she's dead, Chu is going to walk.
You know what Chu has done to me?

785
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:05,279
It's a matter of life and death.

786
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:07,365
- What's up?
- The car!

787
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:17,667
- What now?!
- Taxi!

788
01:12:18,543 --> 01:12:20,253
Call a tow truck!

789
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:23,089
And say sorry to my future
mother-in-law for me. Bye-bye!

790
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,300
Be careful!

791
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:35,476
- Keep the change.
- Thanks!

792
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:50,843
- What happened?
- I don't know why they tied me up here.

793
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:54,889
- Is anyone else here?
- They all left after tying me up.

794
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:57,141
Now you know what kind
of a man Chu is.

795
01:13:57,224 --> 01:14:01,312
If only you had cooperated with us,
there wouldn't be so much trouble.

796
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:03,940
Luckily, I'm well-informed.

797
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:07,151
Or else you'd be dead
without anyone knowing.

798
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:13,574
Let's get out of here.

799
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:17,411
Stop!

800
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,710
Freeze!

801
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:13,968
Step aside.

802
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:19,640
How did you know I was here?

803
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:22,476
Of course I knew you were here.

804
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:33,112
- Hard to believe that you...
- Hard to believe, right?

805
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:36,949
Lots of other things
are hard for you to believe.

806
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:39,076
Aren't we acting
according to the plan?

807
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:43,039
Yes, it's all according to plan.

808
01:15:43,122 --> 01:15:47,752
But the boss wants to use
his own gun... to kill a cop.

809
01:15:47,835 --> 01:15:49,879
To end his life
once and for all.

810
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:52,965
Then who are we
supposed to kill?

811
01:16:05,186 --> 01:16:06,896
Hurry up and run!

812
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:23,537
I can't do it!

813
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:29,752
Jump!

814
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:37,968
Keep going!

815
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:45,059
Stop!

816
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:50,272
Go down
and get Salina!

817
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:52,691
Kid!

818
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:57,822
You're really something!
You dare to interfere with our business?!

819
01:17:04,203 --> 01:17:05,579
That's enough!

820
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:09,834
Take care of him.
I'll clean up.

821
01:17:10,543 --> 01:17:13,212
I can bet on my life
that he hasn't done it!

822
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:15,798
We're not living in a lawless society.
We've got to have proof.

823
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:18,134
How come Ka Kui and
his gun are missing,

824
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:21,512
and this bullet just happens
to be from his gun?

825
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:22,429
How do you explain that?

826
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:26,684
A cop makes a lot of enemies.
Someone may want to frame him.

827
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:30,688
If this happened to a civilian instead of
Ka Kui, what would we have done?

828
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:34,650
Sir, you can't always
go by the book!

829
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:36,277
You also have to show trust
in your men.

830
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:38,237
You think I have anything
against Ka Kui?

831
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:43,659
I just want people to know we don't
sweep our own mistakes under the rug.

832
01:17:44,118 --> 01:17:47,413
I get the feeling that you want to nail him
even more than the crooks!

833
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:48,998
Enough,
Uncle Bill!

834
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:54,295
What would you do in my shoes?

835
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:32,124
Hi, May.

836
01:18:37,254 --> 01:18:38,505
I know.

837
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:44,845
I'll wait for you.

838
01:18:49,516 --> 01:18:51,060
THE MISSING CHAN KA KUI
IS A SUSPECT

839
01:18:51,185 --> 01:18:52,728
POLICEMAN KILLED

840
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:56,440
What now?

841
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:02,071
My mom is really
worried about you.

842
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:18,212
Ka Kui, be careful!

843
01:19:33,227 --> 01:19:35,229
Ka Kui's back!

844
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:49,410
- Ka Kui!
- Ka Kui!

845
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:55,416
Ka Kui!

846
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:59,378
- I didn't do it.
- We believe you.

847
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,714
But where have you been?

848
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:04,883
I don't know.

849
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:09,513
How can you not know?! Were you drunk
and slept over at some girl's place?

850
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:13,142
I was fighting Chu Tu's men.

851
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:16,186
Inspector Man came in
and pointed his gun at me.

852
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:19,648
They took my gun
and shot Man with it.

853
01:20:19,773 --> 01:20:21,942
I can't remember the rest.

854
01:20:23,277 --> 01:20:25,195
Everyone knows you and Man
weren't exactly friends.

855
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:27,781
The bullet that killed him
was fired from your gun.

856
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:32,369
I didn't kill him. How would our
petty conflicts in the past make me..?

857
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:33,871
But who's going to believe you?

858
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:37,124
We're not living in a lawless society.
We need proof.

859
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:41,962
- But I'm glad you're back.
- Hand in your gun first.

860
01:20:44,048 --> 01:20:47,718
Call Homicide. Tell them the prime suspect
just gave himself up.

861
01:20:47,926 --> 01:20:48,761
Call in two men.

862
01:20:50,888 --> 01:20:55,684
Ka Kui, don't worry.
We'll do our very best to help you.

863
01:20:57,227 --> 01:20:59,146
- Take him to the holding cell.
- Yes, sir.

864
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:00,731
And charge him...

865
01:21:01,357 --> 01:21:02,983
with murder.

866
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:07,696
Sir! You...

867
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:11,784
Freeze!

868
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:15,579
- Ka Kui, what are you doing?
- I didn't kill anyone!

869
01:21:16,914 --> 01:21:20,042
- Why charge me with murder?
- I didn't say you killed him,

870
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:23,462
but I have to bring charges
according to the evidence.

871
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:27,466
It's so obvious that I was framed.
Can't you see that at all?!

872
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:30,344
If you were framed,
I'll investigate.

873
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:33,097
- Don't give me that!
- Ka Kui, let Superintendent Li go!

874
01:21:35,682 --> 01:21:36,683
What Superintendent?!

875
01:21:36,809 --> 01:21:40,813
- What you are doing is dangerous!
- Dangerous for him!

876
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:43,023
When we were risking our lives,

877
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:45,484
he was sitting there thinking
about which girl would join him for dinner.

878
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:49,029
We put the crooks under arrest
while he argued about proper procedure.

879
01:21:49,113 --> 01:21:52,282
And that stupid idea of
having me protecting the witness.

880
01:21:52,366 --> 01:21:53,700
That simple, right?!

881
01:21:53,784 --> 01:21:57,329
One twitch from his eyebrows,
and we've got to risk our lives!

882
01:21:57,413 --> 01:21:58,956
- Ka Kui!
- Shut up!

883
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:04,211
You got promoted at our expense!
Have you ever thought of us?

884
01:22:04,294 --> 01:22:09,049
An officer killed only means
three bows and a full report.

885
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:12,177
We also have mothers
that gave birth to us!

886
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:16,807
If we hadn't fought for you,
would you have such a luxurious office?

887
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:18,225
- Ka Kui.
- Go away!

888
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:22,438
Come any closer
and I'll shoot him dead!

889
01:22:22,563 --> 01:22:23,939
Ka Kui, don't do that!

890
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,316
Open the door!

891
01:22:27,067 --> 01:22:28,068
Don't move!

892
01:22:29,069 --> 01:22:30,654
Don't come near!

893
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:32,281
Don't!

894
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:36,743
Don't worry about me.
I know what I'm doing!

895
01:22:40,497 --> 01:22:43,333
Ka Kui has taken
Superintendent Li hostage!

896
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:47,254
Don't move!

897
01:22:48,338 --> 01:22:50,591
Stay cool!
Ka Kui, calm down.

898
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:52,634
Stay back!

899
01:22:55,762 --> 01:22:59,266
- Ka Kui, calm down.
- Let's talk about this.

900
01:22:59,349 --> 01:23:01,059
We'll sort this out.

901
01:23:01,185 --> 01:23:03,687
Put your hands on the table.

902
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:05,355
On the table!

903
01:23:06,773 --> 01:23:08,192
That is quite a foolish act of yours.

904
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:12,196
Give up before it's too late!
We'll help you.

905
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:15,032
Trust us!
We'll sort this out.

906
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:17,910
I trust all of you,
but I can't depend on you.

907
01:23:18,035 --> 01:23:20,370
- You're making it worse!
- Don't force me!

908
01:23:20,454 --> 01:23:21,705
Don't!

909
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:27,628
Don't push him!

910
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:34,801
Don't push him.
Alert all units. Send in sharpshooters.

911
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:56,156
Easy, everybody!

912
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:01,620
Ka Kui!

913
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:11,838
Get in the car.

914
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:15,342
- Ka Kui!
- Drive off!

915
01:24:20,264 --> 01:24:21,807
Don't follow.

916
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:24,851
The Superintendent's life is at stake.

917
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:30,983
Where are you going?

918
01:24:35,112 --> 01:24:36,655
Stop.

919
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,867
Get out.

920
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:50,711
Even if you didn't cooperate,
I wouldn't dare to open fire.

921
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:52,588
It's better this way.

922
01:24:52,671 --> 01:24:56,758
If it wasn't like this,
I wouldn't be sure how to help you.

923
01:24:56,883 --> 01:24:59,344
As soon as I get back,
I'll come after you.

924
01:25:01,013 --> 01:25:04,516
I won't let you get me
before I get Chu Tu.

925
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:11,356
- I hope so.
- Thank you, sir.

926
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:19,031
But it's tough to find out
where Salina is.

927
01:25:20,157 --> 01:25:23,910
Let's just get a couple of girls
and have some fun.

928
01:25:39,426 --> 01:25:45,307
Inspector Chan, it wasn't my fault!
He forced me to do it!

929
01:25:49,519 --> 01:25:50,771
Eat.

930
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:56,943
Can I eat, then?
I'm hungry.

931
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,962
Boss, that brave cop
is on the loose.

932
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:58,714
Didn't the police take him in?

933
01:26:58,797 --> 01:27:02,926
- He kidnapped the superintendent.
- This guy's got some nerve!

934
01:27:03,009 --> 01:27:07,013
We should have killed him too,
once and for all.

935
01:27:07,681 --> 01:27:08,890
Where is Salina?

936
01:27:09,015 --> 01:27:11,351
Mad Wing and Snake Eyes
are looking for her.

937
01:27:11,435 --> 01:27:13,103
But we haven't heard
anything from them yet.

938
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:16,022
Would Salina be with
that brave cop?

939
01:27:23,321 --> 01:27:24,406
What's up, boss?

940
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:32,122
Someone's stealing my
computer data.

941
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:35,417
- Who is it?
- It must be Salina.

942
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:37,836
Only she knows the password.

943
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:39,755
- Go and get her.
- Alert our men.

944
01:27:39,838 --> 01:27:40,922
Call Counsel Cheung.

945
01:27:56,313 --> 01:27:59,858
- How much longer do we need to wait?
- You're impatient?

946
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:03,695
No. I'm scared.

947
01:28:15,582 --> 01:28:17,292
You two stand guard over there.

948
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:31,807
There!

949
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:37,854
Hurry and
call Uncle Bill.

950
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:43,109
Get that briefcase
or we're doomed! Quick!

951
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:23,066
This way!
Chase!

952
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:30,615
- Ka Kui!
- Why didn't you go to the police?

953
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:32,701
They might have been in league
with Inspector Man.

954
01:29:32,826 --> 01:29:34,619
You are my witness.
I'm counting on you.

955
01:29:34,828 --> 01:29:36,496
I've got Chu's data.

956
01:29:55,932 --> 01:29:57,684
Right here!

957
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:22,584
Take her back to the office.
Hurry!

958
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:29,382
- What's going on?
- Mind your own business!

959
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:38,058
Let's go.

960
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,498
- Come on!
- I'm not going.

961
01:33:11,753 --> 01:33:13,004
Kill him!

962
01:34:28,788 --> 01:34:30,540
Catch!

963
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:33,626
It's there!
Go and get it!

964
01:34:37,755 --> 01:34:39,507
- May!
- Are you all right, Ka Kui?

965
01:34:39,632 --> 01:34:42,302
Don't worry about me.
Get the briefcase!

966
01:34:50,226 --> 01:34:51,227
Go to hell!

967
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:57,400
Chu Tu!

968
01:35:02,989 --> 01:35:03,990
Quick!

969
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:13,833
Hurry!

970
01:35:41,027 --> 01:35:43,529
Ka Kui, don't do it!

971
01:35:48,076 --> 01:35:50,828
- Drop the weapon!
- We'll take it from here.

972
01:35:50,954 --> 01:35:54,374
- This is between him and me.
- The law will take care of him.

973
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:57,627
The law? The law takes care of
those who don't have money for a lawyer!

974
01:35:57,794 --> 01:35:58,628
Doesn't work on him!

975
01:35:58,711 --> 01:36:00,588
It won't favor you
to do it in public.

976
01:36:00,797 --> 01:36:02,757
I have nothing to lose
if I kill him right now!

977
01:36:03,174 --> 01:36:05,885
It was Danny Chu
who killed Inspector Man.

978
01:36:05,969 --> 01:36:09,681
All the evidence
is in that briefcase.

979
01:36:13,643 --> 01:36:14,894
Are you all right?

980
01:36:15,019 --> 01:36:18,856
May is hurt, Ka Kui.
Look after her first.

981
01:36:25,196 --> 01:36:28,032
Block every exit and take
all the suspects back to the station!

982
01:36:28,157 --> 01:36:29,409
You cops are going too far,

983
01:36:29,617 --> 01:36:32,954
threatening innocent citizens
with a weapon!

984
01:36:34,247 --> 01:36:37,583
You are a police officer,
but you are not above the law.

985
01:36:37,667 --> 01:36:39,836
On behalf of my client,
I am going to sue you

986
01:36:40,044 --> 01:36:44,716
for assault, kidnapping,
and making threats.

987
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:49,637
This is a miscarriage of justice
and a disturbance of the peace!

988
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:55,059
- You're all witnesses!
- Ka Kui, let go of him!

989
01:36:55,143 --> 01:36:57,812
- Don't fall into his trap!
- Prepare yourself for some jail time.

990
01:36:57,937 --> 01:37:00,273
Yeah, how dare you
threaten the Counsel?

991
01:37:00,356 --> 01:37:02,900
Counsel Cheung,
it's good you arrived that fast!

992
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:26,049
You have to help me
with this report.

993
01:37:26,132 --> 01:37:28,843
- What?
- Let's write it together.

994
01:37:28,926 --> 01:37:31,179
I didn't see anything.

995
01:37:42,982 --> 01:37:44,233
That's enough, Ka Kui!
