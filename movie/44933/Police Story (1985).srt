1
00:01:53,895 --> 00:01:58,025
This is Chu Tu.
He's in his mid to late forties.

2
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:04,300
He's a nightclub owner, trader,
and property developer.

3
00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:06,605
But we've found out all his companies

4
00:02:06,773 --> 00:02:07,832
are losing money.

5
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,236
Hey, how are things up there?

6
00:02:12,012 --> 00:02:14,173
This is Mad Wing, his bodyguard.

7
00:02:15,282 --> 00:02:18,080
All of his employees

8
00:02:18,385 --> 00:02:19,818
are actually hit men.

9
00:02:20,687 --> 00:02:22,449
Be careful!
I'll see you at the dye factory.

10
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:24,745
Wait for me up there.

11
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:25,779
Yes.

12
00:02:33,632 --> 00:02:36,293
This is Danny Chu, his nephew.

13
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:38,530
He's always surrounded by bodyguards.

14
00:02:39,003 --> 00:02:41,563
This is John Ko, the brains
behind Chu Tu's organisation.

15
00:02:43,473 --> 00:02:45,203
This lady's name is Salina Fong.

16
00:02:45,942 --> 00:02:48,536
She's only joined Chu Tu recently.

17
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:51,079
It's hard to tell how much she knows

18
00:02:51,748 --> 00:02:54,238
but she is involved.

19
00:02:58,854 --> 00:03:02,017
Our mission is to arrest
all these drug dealers.

20
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:06,322
The code name is Operation Boar Hunt.

21
00:03:07,295 --> 00:03:08,284
Have you got that?

22
00:03:08,963 --> 00:03:09,952
Yes, sir!

23
00:03:09,998 --> 00:03:11,863
Read your orders.

24
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,864
You all have specific duties.

25
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:25,807
Memorise then destroy.

26
00:03:26,513 --> 00:03:28,071
It's crucial that you stay in position.

27
00:03:31,084 --> 00:03:32,449
Hurry, come on!

28
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:54,003
Attention! Crime squad!

29
00:03:54,505 --> 00:03:57,405
The Operation is underway!

30
00:04:54,826 --> 00:04:55,816
Would you like a cup of tea?

31
00:04:59,798 --> 00:05:00,787
Two teas please!

32
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:01,821
OK!

33
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:16,167
I'll be back for them.

34
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:20,738
There is a suspicious looking guy.

35
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:23,844
Two teas please!

36
00:05:25,021 --> 00:05:26,010
Tell the others, I'll check it out.

37
00:05:34,262 --> 00:05:35,251
Kim!

38
00:05:35,297 --> 00:05:36,594
Are you buying me a tea?

39
00:05:36,932 --> 00:05:38,092
We've been discovered.

40
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:38,997
What?!

41
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:40,501
Follow the guy in the red top.

42
00:05:53,848 --> 00:05:54,837
What is it?

43
00:05:54,882 --> 00:05:56,542
This is Salina.
There's a suspicious looking guy...

44
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,444
What are you doing?

45
00:05:58,485 --> 00:05:59,417
Police!

46
00:05:59,452 --> 00:06:00,441
It's the police!

47
00:06:01,154 --> 00:06:02,143
The police are here!

48
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:17,089
Freeze! Police!

49
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:21,066
I just heard some gunshots.

50
00:06:21,272 --> 00:06:22,261
They've opened fire!

51
00:06:22,306 --> 00:06:22,931
What to do?

52
00:06:22,974 --> 00:06:24,235
Let's break up the crowd first.

53
00:06:24,608 --> 00:06:26,042
Leave this area now!

54
00:06:29,913 --> 00:06:31,847
Crime squad.
What's happening?!

55
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:34,176
Police! Get out of here!
Go on! Hurry!

56
00:06:34,783 --> 00:06:36,274
Quick

57
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:40,344
This way.

58
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:43,552
Listen! Mind the residents

59
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:47,119
and get the kids inside.

60
00:06:47,396 --> 00:06:49,454
Hurry up! Go on!

61
00:06:56,871 --> 00:06:57,860
This way.

62
00:07:11,317 --> 00:07:12,306
Move in and help.

63
00:07:12,586 --> 00:07:13,678
But we're supposed to stay out.

64
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,252
The situation's changed.

65
00:07:15,488 --> 00:07:17,046
Move it!

66
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,388
Let me go!

67
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:29,422
It gets tighter if you move.

68
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:31,693
Let me go!

69
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,071
I'll keep you covered,
you make a break for it.

70
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:47,338
Protect the boss!

71
00:07:47,584 --> 00:07:48,573
Go.

72
00:08:06,735 --> 00:08:08,565
There's a female suspect up there.
Take her back to the station.

73
00:08:14,641 --> 00:08:15,630
It's only me!

74
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,070
Why did they open fire?

75
00:08:21,382 --> 00:08:22,370
Don't ask me.

76
00:08:26,686 --> 00:08:27,948
Calm down!

77
00:08:42,468 --> 00:08:45,095
Help me...Tak!

78
00:08:45,336 --> 00:08:46,325
Cover me!

79
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,459
Tak!

80
00:09:17,365 --> 00:09:18,354
You must stay calm.

81
00:09:20,869 --> 00:09:22,097
It hurts.

82
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,869
Help me.

83
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,600
You stay here and take care of him.

84
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:48,748
They mean business!

85
00:09:50,596 --> 00:09:52,722
Don't forget the warning.

86
00:09:52,998 --> 00:09:54,090
Mind the villagers.

87
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:56,430
But will the bad guys
give a damn about them?

88
00:09:57,436 --> 00:09:58,424
Who made you a cop?

89
00:09:58,969 --> 00:09:59,958
Come here!

90
00:10:04,075 --> 00:10:06,099
Be careful, Ka-kui.
These guys are really mean!

91
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:28,318
Boss! This way!

92
00:10:33,035 --> 00:10:34,023
Get in!

93
00:10:36,437 --> 00:10:38,871
You're blocking the road!
Get out of the way!

94
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:40,296
Reverse!

95
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,001
Not this way!

96
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:48,335
You OK?

97
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,575
This way's blocked, go back.

98
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,315
Go back! Quick!

99
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,076
Go back up!

100
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,084
The road below is blocked!

101
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,017
We're stuck, boss! Now what?!

102
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,415
Go that way!

103
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:00,948
Let's go!

104
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,848
Boss! Quick!

105
00:12:14,993 --> 00:12:15,982
Quick!

106
00:12:30,842 --> 00:12:31,831
This way!

107
00:12:44,287 --> 00:12:45,276
Freeze!

108
00:12:48,891 --> 00:12:50,654
Mind the civilians!

109
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:51,715
Where have you been?

110
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,818
They've all escaped.

111
00:12:53,229 --> 00:12:54,217
We went up to help.

112
00:12:54,262 --> 00:12:55,958
Who gave that order? They're gone!

113
00:12:56,932 --> 00:12:57,955
You can't blame me for that.

114
00:13:08,075 --> 00:13:09,167
Hurry, go!

115
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,268
Can I borrow this?

116
00:13:14,014 --> 00:13:15,446
Tell them to get down.
Stop that.

117
00:13:15,481 --> 00:13:16,346
Get down!

118
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:17,350
Don't let them see my face.

119
00:13:17,384 --> 00:13:18,248
Tell the driver to step on it!

120
00:13:18,285 --> 00:13:19,273
Quick!

121
00:13:25,924 --> 00:13:26,914
Get down!

122
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:12,855
Turn here, turn!

123
00:14:20,474 --> 00:14:21,463
Keep going!

124
00:14:21,742 --> 00:14:22,731
Keep going!

125
00:14:35,088 --> 00:14:36,282
Easy, boss, we'll make it.

126
00:14:36,456 --> 00:14:37,444
Look!

127
00:14:45,831 --> 00:14:47,230
Get up there, and get rid of him.

128
00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:49,760
Tell the driver to go faster!

129
00:15:00,277 --> 00:15:01,267
Come down here and get him.

130
00:15:03,847 --> 00:15:04,836
Come down!

131
00:15:19,662 --> 00:15:20,650
Turn the bus! Go down the hill!

132
00:15:56,461 --> 00:15:58,224
What are you doing?

133
00:15:58,697 --> 00:15:59,994
Police. Stay back!

134
00:16:03,334 --> 00:16:05,462
Boss, the bastard's right in front!

135
00:16:06,304 --> 00:16:07,292
Run over him!

136
00:16:07,338 --> 00:16:07,963
Yes.

137
00:16:08,005 --> 00:16:08,994
Step on it, run over him.

138
00:16:16,047 --> 00:16:17,036
We'll be all right.

139
00:16:46,574 --> 00:16:47,563
Freeze!

140
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,070
You're under arrest,
but you have the right to...

141
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:57,472
If you let me go...
this is all yours.

142
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,084
There is a lot of money here,

143
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,453
no one will ever find out.

144
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:12,518
Smart guy!

145
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:13,987
Stop!

146
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,405
Well done, you guys.

147
00:17:25,943 --> 00:17:29,106
Give him credit if he praises you

148
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,845
and don't let it go to your heads.

149
00:17:31,415 --> 00:17:34,680
I know what to do. Ka-kui is the one
who needs your advice.

150
00:17:35,885 --> 00:17:37,375
I didn't do it alone.

151
00:17:37,553 --> 00:17:39,783
It was a success because of careful planning.

152
00:17:40,456 --> 00:17:41,445
That's a great line.

153
00:17:41,991 --> 00:17:44,858
Don't forget to say it
when the Super comes.

154
00:17:45,128 --> 00:17:46,594
He'll be very happy to hear that.

155
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,333
Operation Boar Hunt
was carefully planned.

156
00:17:54,568 --> 00:17:55,558
You were told to go in

157
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,694
and make the arrest.

158
00:17:57,338 --> 00:17:58,896
You almost let the prime suspect
get away.

159
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:01,497
What happened?

160
00:18:01,575 --> 00:18:02,735
Didn't he give you clear orders?

161
00:18:04,078 --> 00:18:06,638
Yes, but he said the operation
was very well planned.

162
00:18:06,981 --> 00:18:07,970
What?!

163
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:10,749
This operation was carefully planned.

164
00:18:10,985 --> 00:18:13,043
But it had a few flaws.

165
00:18:13,219 --> 00:18:14,208
Why were there flaws?

166
00:18:15,154 --> 00:18:16,144
That's because Ka-kui

167
00:18:16,189 --> 00:18:17,383
couldn't handle the woman.

168
00:18:17,924 --> 00:18:20,721
Before we even got to the store,
they heard her screaming.

169
00:18:21,093 --> 00:18:24,290
How did Chu Tu get through
your men, then?

170
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:25,587
What do you mean by that?

171
00:18:26,264 --> 00:18:27,493
Don't point your fingers at each other.

172
00:18:29,268 --> 00:18:30,256
What?!

173
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:31,165
The PR lady is here.

174
00:18:31,202 --> 00:18:32,192
Let her in.

175
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,674
The press is here, Superintendent.

176
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:39,936
Tell them no comment!

177
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:42,169
Hold it. I asked them to come.

178
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,868
Then, tell them to wait.

179
00:18:44,848 --> 00:18:46,611
Ka-kui, you'll be our spokesman.

180
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,176
Me?!

181
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,818
I can't possibly.

182
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,248
The speech is ready, just read it.

183
00:18:52,488 --> 00:18:54,047
Learn your lines.

184
00:18:54,623 --> 00:18:56,352
You can go now
and don't botch them.

185
00:19:03,332 --> 00:19:05,196
The Chief is well pleased

186
00:19:05,366 --> 00:19:06,594
with Ka-kui's performance.

187
00:19:07,168 --> 00:19:08,192
A promising lad.

188
00:19:09,404 --> 00:19:12,066
After the speech, take him
to do a police recruitment poster.

189
00:19:12,673 --> 00:19:15,734
And arrange for him to appear on TV.

190
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:17,101
A role model?!

191
00:19:17,644 --> 00:19:19,976
The Chief thinks
he's a model policeman.

192
00:19:20,414 --> 00:19:21,506
He'll be really good for it.

193
00:19:23,016 --> 00:19:24,847
What are the charges on Salina?

194
00:19:25,285 --> 00:19:27,878
Drug dealing, resisting arrest
and assaulting police officers.

195
00:19:29,723 --> 00:19:30,711
Drop all the charges.

196
00:19:31,524 --> 00:19:32,616
Really?!

197
00:19:36,896 --> 00:19:39,489
You played a big part
in this operation.

198
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:44,033
The success of this operation
depended on skilful planning.

199
00:19:45,002 --> 00:19:45,992
He means you.

200
00:19:46,238 --> 00:19:47,535
Will you get a promotion?

201
00:19:49,006 --> 00:19:50,030
As a police officer,

202
00:19:50,207 --> 00:19:51,902
I don't fight crime to get promoted.

203
00:19:52,476 --> 00:19:54,637
I'm not worried about promotions.

204
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:57,012
Did Chu Tu try to bribe you?

205
00:19:57,448 --> 00:20:00,780
He sure did, with millions.
He could have bribed the whole force.

206
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,950
Just kidding! Don't put that down.

207
00:20:03,386 --> 00:20:04,478
Can you two sit closer?

208
00:20:06,689 --> 00:20:07,678
What are you doing?

209
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,519
Just saying hello.

210
00:20:09,825 --> 00:20:10,814
Don't sit too close.

211
00:20:12,161 --> 00:20:13,149
Let me sit here.

212
00:20:17,032 --> 00:20:18,021
He'll come this way, right?

213
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,459
Yeah!

214
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,623
Let's start!

215
00:20:32,345 --> 00:20:33,335
Straighten up your back.

216
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:35,069
Open your eyes a bit more.

217
00:20:35,815 --> 00:20:36,941
Open your mouth. Wider.

218
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,139
Wider still!

219
00:20:38,184 --> 00:20:39,515
More.

220
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,718
Forget it,

221
00:20:43,923 --> 00:20:44,912
just be yourself!

222
00:20:46,025 --> 00:20:47,014
Ready?!

223
00:20:49,728 --> 00:20:50,854
The handcuffs in the middle.

224
00:20:51,196 --> 00:20:52,628
Try to be more energetic.

225
00:21:08,178 --> 00:21:09,577
Your plan wouldn't work.

226
00:21:10,347 --> 00:21:11,336
Why not?

227
00:21:11,782 --> 00:21:13,340
Remember, she's Chu Tu's secretary,

228
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,414
not just anyone can get that job.

229
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,011
Chu Tu's been arrested

230
00:21:18,454 --> 00:21:20,923
and once he knows
his secretary is going to be a witness,

231
00:21:21,557 --> 00:21:22,546
what will he do?

232
00:21:24,193 --> 00:21:28,185
He'll do everything he can
to stop her appearing in court.

233
00:21:30,231 --> 00:21:32,028
Whoever we send to protect her
will be in danger.

234
00:21:35,402 --> 00:21:37,234
Don't be a cop if you're not

235
00:21:37,906 --> 00:21:39,338
willing to risk your life.

236
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,336
Put that line on one of our
recruitment posters.

237
00:21:43,544 --> 00:21:45,535
We don't have enough evidence to
prosecute him.

238
00:21:45,946 --> 00:21:47,504
We must push him into a corner.

239
00:21:47,815 --> 00:21:50,146
Then we can put him behind bars.

240
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,812
Who's going to protect her?
I suggest...

241
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,979
I have someone in mind already.

242
00:21:56,022 --> 00:21:57,353
Great minds think alike.

243
00:22:04,296 --> 00:22:05,285
Good luck to him.

244
00:22:06,998 --> 00:22:08,795
You're the only one who got bail.

245
00:22:09,735 --> 00:22:11,292
You're really lucky.

246
00:22:15,873 --> 00:22:17,135
They're here to see the Super.

247
00:22:17,308 --> 00:22:18,297
Please wait.

248
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:19,634
Please wait. Right.

249
00:22:20,644 --> 00:22:21,940
You can leave after you've seen him.

250
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,573
You can go in now.

251
00:22:29,018 --> 00:22:30,007
Thanks!

252
00:22:36,525 --> 00:22:37,514
Please sit down!

253
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:42,587
You can leave now, Miss Fong.

254
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:46,266
Wait a second.

255
00:22:46,502 --> 00:22:48,093
Please keep this subpoena,

256
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:49,860
you'll need it to appear in court.

257
00:22:51,806 --> 00:22:52,795
What's the charge?

258
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,829
Nothing!

259
00:22:53,975 --> 00:22:56,944
But you'll be acting
as our witness.

260
00:22:57,644 --> 00:23:00,614
I'm sorry!
My client isn't going to do that.

261
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:03,140
We're not asking her.

262
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:05,678
According to law, she has to do it.

263
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:10,979
Inspector Chan!

264
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:14,850
Your job is to protect Miss Fong

265
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:16,083
until she appears in court.

266
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:17,985
Me? Protect her?

267
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:18,689
Why not?

268
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:19,992
Great!

269
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:21,220
I don't need his protection.

270
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:24,401
As long as he doesn't harass you,
you can't refuse.

271
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,561
Inspector Chan.

272
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,331
As an escort of the witness,

273
00:23:31,742 --> 00:23:34,233
you must be aware that
the witness is often faced with threat,

274
00:23:34,411 --> 00:23:35,400
disturbance, and assault,

275
00:23:35,446 --> 00:23:37,209
or irritated

276
00:23:37,548 --> 00:23:39,345
by the intentions of such.

277
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,583
It is your duty to see her safety

278
00:23:41,951 --> 00:23:46,149
and personal rights are intact.

279
00:23:46,456 --> 00:23:47,445
Yes, sir!

280
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,682
But can you send someone else?

281
00:23:49,392 --> 00:23:50,825
You'll get expenses

282
00:23:51,226 --> 00:23:52,250
for this assignment -

283
00:23:52,627 --> 00:23:53,652
HK$32 per day.

284
00:23:54,497 --> 00:23:55,758
It's an old tradition,

285
00:23:56,131 --> 00:23:57,120
unchanged for years.

286
00:23:57,866 --> 00:23:59,857
I know it's very little. That's all.

287
00:24:00,368 --> 00:24:03,895
Can we talk to you alone, Miss Fong?

288
00:24:04,105 --> 00:24:05,129
My client doesn't answer questions

289
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,270
without the presence of her lawyer.

290
00:24:07,575 --> 00:24:08,564
We won't ask her any questions.

291
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,937
We just want some advice
for her own good.

292
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,247
You have the right to refuse this.

293
00:24:19,953 --> 00:24:21,682
Let me see what they have to say.

294
00:24:23,256 --> 00:24:24,689
Mr Cheung! Please excuse us.

295
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,348
You don't have to answer

296
00:24:28,393 --> 00:24:30,453
if they ask you any questions

297
00:24:30,662 --> 00:24:32,994
about the case or others.

298
00:24:38,569 --> 00:24:39,558
Get out of here!

299
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:40,594
I have to go, too?

300
00:24:40,639 --> 00:24:42,162
What is your rank?

301
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,473
What do you want to talk to me about?

302
00:25:28,482 --> 00:25:31,473
Nothing, you can go now.

303
00:25:35,354 --> 00:25:36,343
See you in court.

304
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,179
Did they ask... Let's go.

305
00:25:42,661 --> 00:25:43,651
Ka-kui.

306
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,818
Your tape recorder.

307
00:25:45,864 --> 00:25:46,831
OK.

308
00:25:46,865 --> 00:25:47,854
What did they say to you?

309
00:25:48,801 --> 00:25:49,824
They didn't say anything.

310
00:25:50,402 --> 00:25:52,336
I'm your lawyer, you can trust me.

311
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,839
They didn't say a word to me.

312
00:25:59,276 --> 00:26:00,265
Why was it only her...

313
00:26:00,411 --> 00:26:01,400
They're coming!

314
00:26:04,447 --> 00:26:05,472
How's boss and the others?

315
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,841
I can't bail them out.

316
00:26:08,084 --> 00:26:09,813
What about Salina, then?

317
00:26:10,554 --> 00:26:12,248
She's their witness.

318
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:13,682
What? Really?!

319
00:26:13,923 --> 00:26:15,082
They want me to do it.

320
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:16,955
You should have turned it down.

321
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,927
Stop bothering our witness!

322
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:21,621
Who are you?

323
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,259
I'm a cop!

324
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,925
My duty is to protect her.

325
00:26:26,435 --> 00:26:29,460
If you keep doing that, I can charge
you with interfering with the police.

326
00:26:30,271 --> 00:26:31,261
Salina...

327
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,335
You can only say goodbye or bye-bye.

328
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:36,041
One more word and you're under arrest.

329
00:26:39,746 --> 00:26:40,735
I'll take you home.

330
00:26:41,716 --> 00:26:43,148
That's part of my job.

331
00:26:43,783 --> 00:26:45,148
I'll tell them nothing!

332
00:26:49,356 --> 00:26:50,754
Now what, Mr Cheung?

333
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:51,980
I'll see your boss this afternoon.

334
00:26:52,993 --> 00:26:53,981
All right! Let's go!

335
00:26:56,629 --> 00:26:57,618
It's dangerous for you
to hang around outside.

336
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,698
Let's go home, shall we?

337
00:26:59,999 --> 00:27:01,397
It's none of your business.

338
00:27:03,702 --> 00:27:05,635
It's for your own safety.

339
00:27:07,205 --> 00:27:09,469
I don't need your protection, you fool!

340
00:27:11,908 --> 00:27:13,809
You know what happened to the last

341
00:27:14,045 --> 00:27:15,306
witness who said that?

342
00:27:15,612 --> 00:27:16,601
What happened?!

343
00:27:17,114 --> 00:27:18,103
Were they shot?

344
00:27:18,383 --> 00:27:21,749
Don't try to scare me.
It won't work.

345
00:27:22,251 --> 00:27:23,240
You're right!

346
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:24,446
They were fine in the end.

347
00:27:24,888 --> 00:27:26,047
You can say whatever you want.

348
00:27:26,355 --> 00:27:27,344
You can't scare me!

349
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,151
All the evidence

350
00:27:32,662 --> 00:27:33,650
points to the defendants.

351
00:27:33,995 --> 00:27:35,588
Only your situation is better.

352
00:27:36,198 --> 00:27:38,392
We're depending on you, Mr Cheung.

353
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,690
I'll do my best.

354
00:27:40,068 --> 00:27:41,467
You'd better be prepared for bad news.

355
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,101
The chances are slim.

356
00:27:43,604 --> 00:27:44,867
If I walk away free,

357
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:46,571
I'll take good care of you.

358
00:27:49,576 --> 00:27:50,941
There's still something
we need to worry about.

359
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,674
Salina is their witness.

360
00:27:55,182 --> 00:27:56,206
Is she really?!

361
00:27:56,917 --> 00:27:58,406
She's been granted bail.

362
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,649
The police even gave her an escort -

363
00:28:00,921 --> 00:28:02,217
the guy who arrested you.

364
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:08,617
Salina doesn't know much.
She's new.

365
00:28:09,227 --> 00:28:10,251
That doesn't concern me.

366
00:28:10,662 --> 00:28:12,028
But she could say something bad

367
00:28:12,264 --> 00:28:13,595
about us in court.

368
00:28:15,534 --> 00:28:16,523
I don't think she would...

369
00:28:18,804 --> 00:28:22,365
All right.
Call Danny for me.

370
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:25,470
Tell him to take care of Salina.

371
00:28:27,678 --> 00:28:28,667
All right.

372
00:28:32,817 --> 00:28:33,805
Thanks a lot!

373
00:28:34,017 --> 00:28:35,006
Keep the change!

374
00:28:35,185 --> 00:28:36,174
See you later!

375
00:28:40,856 --> 00:28:43,621
It's dangerous to stay home alone.

376
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,654
I always live dangerously.

377
00:28:57,305 --> 00:28:59,432
John? I just got back.

378
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,629
The phone is tapped.

379
00:29:02,976 --> 00:29:04,706
All right, I'll meet you later.

380
00:30:10,504 --> 00:30:11,493
I'm really scared!

381
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:49,102
You think you can scare me like that?

382
00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:56,168
Help!

383
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,952
Help!

384
00:31:06,122 --> 00:31:07,315
I'm going to kill you!

385
00:31:15,865 --> 00:31:16,854
Don't go.

386
00:31:17,366 --> 00:31:18,354
I'll get you!

387
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:21,325
You have to die!

388
00:31:27,075 --> 00:31:28,235
I'm going to kill you!

389
00:31:29,543 --> 00:31:30,532
Go to hell!

390
00:31:33,647 --> 00:31:34,636
Go to hell!

391
00:31:35,782 --> 00:31:36,771
I got you!

392
00:31:39,485 --> 00:31:41,750
I'm going to kill you!

393
00:32:00,705 --> 00:32:01,693
Don't run away!

394
00:32:08,846 --> 00:32:09,835
I've got you now!

395
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:12,670
Go to hell!

396
00:32:14,418 --> 00:32:22,619
Here I come!

397
00:32:22,658 --> 00:32:23,647
Hide no where!

398
00:32:25,628 --> 00:32:26,616
There's no way out. You're finished.

399
00:32:26,728 --> 00:32:31,165
I'm going to kill you!

400
00:32:35,237 --> 00:32:36,465
Don't worry! I'm here!

401
00:32:43,077 --> 00:32:44,840
She's terrified. Can I go now?

402
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,206
You can leave right now.

403
00:32:55,822 --> 00:32:57,346
Hold on to him, I'll call the police.

404
00:33:27,384 --> 00:33:28,976
I knocked him out!

405
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,789
Not yet! He's still conscious.

406
00:33:33,056 --> 00:33:34,317
He's fighting me!

407
00:33:34,657 --> 00:33:36,682
Keep away from us!

408
00:33:39,161 --> 00:33:40,856
Please go now.
You can't stay here any longer.

409
00:33:41,096 --> 00:33:42,085
Don't faint!

410
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,098
Go!

411
00:33:43,132 --> 00:33:45,326
I go...

412
00:33:48,803 --> 00:33:49,792
He's passed out!

413
00:33:51,106 --> 00:33:53,472
No! He's still conscious. See?
Look at me.

414
00:33:59,113 --> 00:34:01,104
Don't!

415
00:34:01,315 --> 00:34:03,282
Please leave here right now!

416
00:34:03,483 --> 00:34:04,473
Go now! Go on!

417
00:34:04,718 --> 00:34:05,707
Go! Hurry!

418
00:34:09,689 --> 00:34:10,678
No more acting. Let�s go!

419
00:34:13,692 --> 00:34:14,682
Leave him to me!

420
00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:18,289
He's fainted.

421
00:34:19,565 --> 00:34:20,553
This time is real.

422
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:22,125
Let me hit him one more time!

423
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,760
Stop, or we won't be able
to identify him.

424
00:34:27,972 --> 00:34:29,906
I don't want to do this any more.

425
00:34:39,716 --> 00:34:40,979
I don't know him.

426
00:34:41,218 --> 00:34:43,879
They'd use a stranger to kill you.

427
00:34:44,154 --> 00:34:45,143
Why kill me?

428
00:34:45,487 --> 00:34:49,082
Of course, Chu Tu's a ruthless man.

429
00:34:49,558 --> 00:34:51,527
Inspector Chou, it's Ka-kui.

430
00:34:51,995 --> 00:34:53,928
I just realised this is a tough case.

431
00:34:54,363 --> 00:34:55,352
Can you send a replacement?

432
00:34:55,731 --> 00:34:56,720
No?!

433
00:34:56,832 --> 00:34:58,993
I'm not risking my life

434
00:34:59,635 --> 00:35:01,226
for a few thousands.

435
00:35:03,571 --> 00:35:06,199
I've had enough of her!

436
00:35:07,408 --> 00:35:08,636
I don't give a damn about her any more.

437
00:35:08,843 --> 00:35:10,140
I quit! Enough is enough!

438
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:14,936
Where are you going?

439
00:35:14,981 --> 00:35:15,606
Home!

440
00:35:15,649 --> 00:35:18,083
You're supposed to protect me!

441
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:20,082
But you're not cooperating.

442
00:35:20,253 --> 00:35:21,241
How can I protect you.

443
00:35:21,454 --> 00:35:24,356
What if I cooperate?

444
00:35:24,558 --> 00:35:27,025
It's too late! I quit.

445
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,661
I can't believe it!

446
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:38,859
You cops have no sense of duty.

447
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,304
I have.
But there's nothing I can do.

448
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,030
If I stay here, I'll get killed, too.

449
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,869
I'll cooperate.

450
00:35:48,445 --> 00:35:50,640
I'm not forcing you.

451
00:35:52,649 --> 00:35:54,617
I'm doing it of my own free will.

452
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,275
You should come to my house,

453
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,475
it's much safer there.

454
00:35:57,787 --> 00:35:58,776
Great!

455
00:35:58,821 --> 00:35:59,811
Look at you!

456
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:01,145
I'll get changed!

457
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,420
Chu's men could be back any time.

458
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,949
I won't change my clothes, then.

459
00:36:05,294 --> 00:36:06,352
Now what?

460
00:36:16,538 --> 00:36:17,527
What is it?!

461
00:36:17,806 --> 00:36:18,794
I'm checking to see if everything's OK.

462
00:36:24,845 --> 00:36:26,005
Go back!

463
00:36:27,815 --> 00:36:28,804
Come out.

464
00:36:35,488 --> 00:36:36,477
Why are you holding that?

465
00:36:37,457 --> 00:36:38,583
This is your jacket.

466
00:36:38,925 --> 00:36:40,255
I told you to put it on.

467
00:36:40,792 --> 00:36:41,782
Yes.

468
00:36:42,395 --> 00:36:43,383
Follow me!

469
00:36:50,402 --> 00:36:51,390
Use my car.

470
00:36:52,136 --> 00:36:53,126
Which one is yours?

471
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:54,326
Over there.

472
00:37:02,947 --> 00:37:03,971
Why are you not nervous at all?

473
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:07,180
I'm used to situations like this.

474
00:37:09,886 --> 00:37:11,080
I told you to stay quiet, didn't l?

475
00:37:11,321 --> 00:37:12,309
Now what?

476
00:37:12,955 --> 00:37:14,924
My son!

477
00:37:15,158 --> 00:37:16,146
Yours?

478
00:37:18,327 --> 00:37:19,316
Close the car door!

479
00:38:02,334 --> 00:38:04,165
It's me!

480
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:05,393
Give me my gun!

481
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:13,571
It's in my jacket pocket.

482
00:38:21,618 --> 00:38:22,608
Help!

483
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:32,383
I've got you!

484
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,360
Freeze!

485
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,396
Freeze!

486
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,670
Stay calm! Give me the gun.

487
00:38:52,145 --> 00:38:53,305
Stay calm! Keep away!

488
00:38:58,886 --> 00:38:59,874
Go.

489
00:39:03,255 --> 00:39:05,019
Give me the gun! It's me!

490
00:39:18,202 --> 00:39:19,191
Are you all right?

491
00:39:19,672 --> 00:39:20,660
Where are they?

492
00:39:20,905 --> 00:39:22,429
You scared them off with that shot.

493
00:39:22,907 --> 00:39:24,966
We must get you away from here,
those guys are for real.

494
00:39:27,345 --> 00:39:29,437
Who was the guy at my house, then?

495
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,170
He wanted to kill you, too.

496
00:39:31,715 --> 00:39:32,977
But these are professionals.

497
00:39:34,418 --> 00:39:36,113
I see why you're nervous now.

498
00:39:36,653 --> 00:39:37,642
Get in the car.

499
00:39:48,364 --> 00:39:49,352
You're crying?!

500
00:39:50,732 --> 00:39:52,291
How could Chu Tu do this to me?

501
00:39:52,468 --> 00:39:54,059
You can't be that naive.

502
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:57,966
Your boss is capable of anything.

503
00:39:58,273 --> 00:39:59,831
He can't have you in that courtroom!

504
00:40:00,341 --> 00:40:01,330
What should I do then?

505
00:40:01,508 --> 00:40:03,806
You should tell the judge everything

506
00:40:04,144 --> 00:40:06,772
so he can put Chu in jail
and then you'll be safe.

507
00:40:07,514 --> 00:40:08,503
What should I say to the judge?

508
00:40:10,683 --> 00:40:13,710
What rackets Chu Tu's involved in,
who his contacts are,

509
00:40:13,887 --> 00:40:15,217
who the dealers are.

510
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:18,879
Why are you taping this?

511
00:40:19,392 --> 00:40:21,257
It's for my own reference.

512
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,089
How long have you worked for him?

513
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:24,618
Four years.

514
00:40:27,432 --> 00:40:28,797
He's a family friend.

515
00:40:29,101 --> 00:40:31,467
He used to give my mother
money to buy me food.

516
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:34,566
Now you help him deal drugs.

517
00:40:35,374 --> 00:40:37,068
I hardly know anything.

518
00:40:37,575 --> 00:40:39,304
You can still tell me what you do know.

519
00:40:43,313 --> 00:40:45,305
If you remember anything else,

520
00:40:45,483 --> 00:40:46,881
don't forget to tell me.

521
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,951
Do you have enough to prosecute him?

522
00:40:50,253 --> 00:40:51,413
That's for the court to decide.

523
00:40:51,654 --> 00:40:52,643
What you've told me is very useful.

524
00:41:02,064 --> 00:41:04,691
Come in.

525
00:41:07,569 --> 00:41:08,557
Let me turn on the lights.

526
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:14,864
It's May.

527
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,909
I almost forgot today's my birthday.

528
00:41:19,379 --> 00:41:20,368
Are you all right?

529
00:41:28,054 --> 00:41:29,214
Let me introduce you,

530
00:41:29,522 --> 00:41:30,511
this is Miss Fong.

531
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,985
Let's go.

532
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:41,554
Are you all right?

533
00:41:42,968 --> 00:41:43,956
I'm fine.

534
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:45,224
May!

535
00:41:48,907 --> 00:41:52,273
They've all gone? That was quick!

536
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,405
It's all my fault.
She wanted to surprise you,

537
00:41:55,879 --> 00:41:57,369
but you brought me here.

538
00:41:57,948 --> 00:41:59,040
And I'm dressed like this.

539
00:41:59,716 --> 00:42:00,705
Of course she's angry.

540
00:42:01,084 --> 00:42:03,143
I'm angry, too.

541
00:42:03,353 --> 00:42:04,377
I didn't even have the chance to explain.

542
00:42:05,188 --> 00:42:07,019
She dumped the cake on me!

543
00:42:07,356 --> 00:42:08,517
I won't answer

544
00:42:08,724 --> 00:42:09,713
if she calls to apologize.

545
00:42:10,393 --> 00:42:11,382
I doubt she will.

546
00:42:14,797 --> 00:42:16,058
I knew she would be back!

547
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:25,331
What so happy about it?

548
00:42:25,607 --> 00:42:26,664
I saw May. What's wrong?

549
00:42:27,141 --> 00:42:28,904
She saw me with our witness.

550
00:42:29,143 --> 00:42:31,304
I'll go and explain to her.

551
00:42:32,646 --> 00:42:34,841
No need. Tell her to curb her temper.

552
00:42:37,784 --> 00:42:39,012
Why do I have to explain everything

553
00:42:39,252 --> 00:42:40,777
to everyone?

554
00:42:41,087 --> 00:42:42,384
I'm sick and tired of it.

555
00:42:42,856 --> 00:42:43,845
Do you want some cake?

556
00:42:44,923 --> 00:42:45,913
What about a drink, then?

557
00:42:45,992 --> 00:42:47,323
Orange juice, please!

558
00:42:47,494 --> 00:42:48,482
Help yourself!

559
00:42:56,869 --> 00:42:57,893
Do you live alone?

560
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:00,228
It's too big, they'd get me
for corruption.

561
00:43:00,471 --> 00:43:02,769
I rent it with a friend.
And he's away.

562
00:43:02,807 --> 00:43:03,796
I'm really sorry.

563
00:43:03,841 --> 00:43:06,810
Your girlfriend was furious when she saw me.

564
00:43:07,378 --> 00:43:08,367
Don't worry.

565
00:43:08,412 --> 00:43:11,381
I was doing my job.

566
00:43:15,252 --> 00:43:16,947
Come on! Come in!

567
00:43:17,854 --> 00:43:19,344
You'll be all right. I'm leaving.

568
00:43:19,723 --> 00:43:20,882
See you!

569
00:43:28,531 --> 00:43:29,657
I'm just a cop now.

570
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:31,559
But I might become a movie star

571
00:43:31,733 --> 00:43:33,929
and have to kiss ladies passionately.

572
00:43:34,336 --> 00:43:36,098
What would she do then?

573
00:43:40,808 --> 00:43:42,399
She loves you, so she's jealous.

574
00:43:42,643 --> 00:43:44,305
I'll explain to her.

575
00:43:44,546 --> 00:43:46,445
What for?

576
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,704
She'll never understand me.

577
00:43:48,115 --> 00:43:51,084
Aren't you going
to say something nice to her?

578
00:43:51,285 --> 00:43:52,751
No way!

579
00:43:52,985 --> 00:43:54,146
If I started sweet-talking,

580
00:43:54,421 --> 00:43:56,650
I'd have a million girls.

581
00:44:01,627 --> 00:44:03,821
You love her a lot, don't you?

582
00:44:04,397 --> 00:44:07,024
To be honest, I do love her a lot!

583
00:44:07,465 --> 00:44:08,727
But loving her is one thing,

584
00:44:09,034 --> 00:44:10,968
apologizing is another.

585
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:13,299
When she gets home,

586
00:44:13,505 --> 00:44:15,302
she'll call and apologize to me.

587
00:44:16,808 --> 00:44:17,796
What a waste of food!

588
00:44:28,985 --> 00:44:29,974
Am I right?

589
00:44:30,019 --> 00:44:31,919
She couldn't wait to call me.

590
00:44:32,922 --> 00:44:33,911
Hello.

591
00:44:33,957 --> 00:44:35,151
Hello?

592
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:37,518
Is that your girlfriend?

593
00:44:38,161 --> 00:44:40,754
It's her. She's crying!

594
00:44:42,998 --> 00:44:45,364
Stop crying. You shouldn't
humiliate me in front of people.

595
00:44:45,834 --> 00:44:47,324
What?!

596
00:44:47,736 --> 00:44:49,828
If I was with a man,
you'd think I was gay.

597
00:44:50,171 --> 00:44:52,572
You're so childish!

598
00:44:52,641 --> 00:44:53,629
Curb your temper!

599
00:44:53,674 --> 00:44:54,402
Let me explain to her.

600
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:55,431
No need!

601
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:58,472
Curb that temper of yours!

602
00:44:58,846 --> 00:45:00,904
You should show me some respect.

603
00:45:01,081 --> 00:45:02,140
Stop crying. Talk to you later.

604
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,944
It's time to teach her a good lesson.

605
00:45:16,962 --> 00:45:18,088
When did she come back?

606
00:45:18,631 --> 00:45:20,690
Right after you went in the shower.

607
00:45:21,266 --> 00:45:22,391
So she heard everything?

608
00:45:24,136 --> 00:45:25,125
The phone call?!

609
00:45:34,612 --> 00:45:36,044
Not again!

610
00:45:36,713 --> 00:45:38,544
May!

611
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:43,480
Let me explain.

612
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:46,387
She's our witness,
my job is to protect her.

613
00:45:46,423 --> 00:45:48,287
I'm mad about what you just said!

614
00:45:48,891 --> 00:45:50,290
I was just kidding.

615
00:45:50,493 --> 00:45:52,154
Don't be mad.

616
00:45:52,294 --> 00:45:53,283
Why are you angry?

617
00:45:53,329 --> 00:45:54,022
Why?

618
00:45:54,062 --> 00:45:55,462
You just insulted me in front of her.

619
00:45:55,698 --> 00:45:57,494
How dare you?!

620
00:45:57,966 --> 00:45:59,263
Go away!

621
00:45:59,434 --> 00:46:00,595
Please listen to me! May!

622
00:46:00,936 --> 00:46:02,562
May...

623
00:46:05,507 --> 00:46:06,496
Are you all right?

624
00:46:06,675 --> 00:46:09,165
No! Are you happy now?!
I hurt.

625
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:10,937
Of course I'm not.
I didn't mean to do that!

626
00:46:11,212 --> 00:46:12,235
Your shoe.

627
00:46:12,913 --> 00:46:14,005
Here, put it on.

628
00:46:15,949 --> 00:46:16,938
Go away!

629
00:46:16,984 --> 00:46:17,916
May, please listen to me!

630
00:46:17,951 --> 00:46:18,939
No, I don't want to!

631
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,410
Don't be so childish.

632
00:46:22,256 --> 00:46:23,552
Listen to me, will you?

633
00:46:24,057 --> 00:46:25,957
Let me go.

634
00:46:29,861 --> 00:46:30,850
Be careful!

635
00:46:33,865 --> 00:46:34,854
I hate you!

636
00:47:10,132 --> 00:47:11,531
Where is she?

637
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,091
I accepted her apologies,

638
00:47:13,301 --> 00:47:15,634
and she went home.

639
00:47:17,138 --> 00:47:18,127
Oh, you! That hurt?

640
00:47:18,573 --> 00:47:19,563
What did I do?

641
00:47:19,741 --> 00:47:22,471
You really poked me!

642
00:47:24,345 --> 00:47:26,074
You're breaking it!

643
00:47:26,247 --> 00:47:27,804
Don't push too hard!

644
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:30,813
What an ugly thing!

645
00:47:30,984 --> 00:47:32,008
Go away!

646
00:47:32,986 --> 00:47:34,543
It's the only one I got. It's broken.

647
00:47:41,027 --> 00:47:43,085
You got me all wet!

648
00:47:43,796 --> 00:47:44,784
Let me wipe it for you.

649
00:47:46,398 --> 00:47:48,331
Please, no more! No, don't!

650
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:51,029
Not there, here.

651
00:47:51,836 --> 00:47:52,825
Here?!

652
00:47:54,105 --> 00:47:57,472
Be gentle! That hurt!

653
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:08,778
This sofa's hard, it's not very comfy.
Let's go to bed now.

654
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,383
Let's go to bed.

655
00:48:11,789 --> 00:48:12,813
But where can I sleep?

656
00:48:13,389 --> 00:48:14,413
On my bed.

657
00:48:14,857 --> 00:48:15,846
And you?

658
00:48:16,259 --> 00:48:17,317
Next to you.

659
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,622
You're so protective.
It's exciting!

660
00:48:36,911 --> 00:48:37,901
I'm going to bed.

661
00:48:39,547 --> 00:48:40,605
Don't wake me up.

662
00:48:42,749 --> 00:48:45,547
Women are weird!

663
00:49:01,066 --> 00:49:02,055
Hello?

664
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,192
Ka-kui? Wait!

665
00:49:03,501 --> 00:49:04,560
He's on the line.

666
00:49:06,038 --> 00:49:08,301
You're late. We're waiting for you!

667
00:49:08,472 --> 00:49:10,304
He's not here.

668
00:49:10,608 --> 00:49:12,838
I know it's you. Quick!
Get that witness here.

669
00:49:27,557 --> 00:49:28,750
What was your duty on that day?

670
00:49:29,024 --> 00:49:32,084
I was observing the squatter huts
behind the site.

671
00:49:32,561 --> 00:49:34,290
The suspects were trying to escape,

672
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:35,861
and I arrested two of them.

673
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:37,254
Thank you!

674
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,296
Can I ask the witness a question?

675
00:49:42,137 --> 00:49:43,125
Inspector Kim,

676
00:49:43,972 --> 00:49:46,338
you said you saw the suspects escaping.

677
00:49:47,408 --> 00:49:49,967
Did they pass in front of you
one by one?

678
00:49:50,878 --> 00:49:52,813
Or did you have a special device

679
00:49:53,047 --> 00:49:54,035
to allow you see them

680
00:49:54,181 --> 00:49:57,412
escaping at the same time?

681
00:49:58,485 --> 00:50:00,543
I object!

682
00:50:00,753 --> 00:50:03,689
I object! The question played
with the witness's wording.

683
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:05,079
Overruled!

684
00:50:06,025 --> 00:50:07,686
Thank you! No more questions!

685
00:50:08,828 --> 00:50:10,318
Bring on the next witness.

686
00:50:33,616 --> 00:50:34,914
That's my spot.

687
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,108
I'm in a hurry!

688
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,782
I want that space!

689
00:50:40,523 --> 00:50:41,512
Nice parking, though.

690
00:50:53,368 --> 00:50:54,493
What?! She's gone?

691
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:56,459
What have you been up to?

692
00:50:57,172 --> 00:50:58,160
Now what? We might lose.

693
00:50:58,205 --> 00:50:59,172
I don't know.

694
00:50:59,206 --> 00:51:00,196
We'll lose.

695
00:51:00,275 --> 00:51:02,868
How could you be so sure that one of

696
00:51:03,144 --> 00:51:06,341
the escaping suspects was my client?

697
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:08,739
He had the same clothes.

698
00:51:09,215 --> 00:51:10,615
In other words, you didn't have a

699
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:12,114
clear view of the suspects' faces.

700
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:14,709
I would say so.

701
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:17,879
Are you short-sighted?

702
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:19,446
No, I'm not.

703
00:51:19,758 --> 00:51:20,850
All right. No more questions.

704
00:51:22,828 --> 00:51:24,193
Next witness.

705
00:51:39,677 --> 00:51:40,665
I swear to tell the truth.

706
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,621
I was at the squatter huts
for the operation.

707
00:52:00,029 --> 00:52:01,519
The first, second, third

708
00:52:01,764 --> 00:52:03,755
and fourth defendants opened fire.

709
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,533
I saw them jump on a bus.

710
00:52:05,834 --> 00:52:08,325
So I took a short cut
and went down the hill.

711
00:52:08,571 --> 00:52:09,696
A citizen helped me

712
00:52:10,038 --> 00:52:12,700
to stop the bus with his car.

713
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,906
After the bus stopped,

714
00:52:15,243 --> 00:52:17,267
I arrested the first defendant.

715
00:52:17,578 --> 00:52:19,342
He tried to bribe me,

716
00:52:19,681 --> 00:52:20,874
but I refused.

717
00:52:22,483 --> 00:52:24,781
That was very clear. Thank you!

718
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:29,783
You were at the squatter house.

719
00:52:30,823 --> 00:52:31,812
What time was that?

720
00:52:32,025 --> 00:52:33,014
About 6:00 am.

721
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:34,184
What time exactly?

722
00:52:34,426 --> 00:52:35,416
5:55am.

723
00:52:35,595 --> 00:52:36,653
Let's say 6:00am.

724
00:52:37,163 --> 00:52:39,392
In December in Hong Kong,

725
00:52:39,631 --> 00:52:42,293
sunrise is at 6:23am.
Did you know that?

726
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:44,190
I didn't know.

727
00:52:44,236 --> 00:52:45,224
Is that true?

728
00:52:45,269 --> 00:52:46,202
I don't know.

729
00:52:46,238 --> 00:52:47,830
Do you know the saying

730
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,267
Darkness before dawn?

731
00:52:49,874 --> 00:52:50,864
No, I don't.

732
00:52:50,909 --> 00:52:52,170
The saying means that it's dark

733
00:52:52,476 --> 00:52:56,640
before the sun rises.

734
00:52:57,348 --> 00:52:58,337
I might have heard of it.

735
00:52:58,382 --> 00:52:59,370
All right.

736
00:52:59,582 --> 00:53:01,312
If there wasn't much light,

737
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:03,816
should we believe
you could actually see my client?

738
00:53:04,054 --> 00:53:05,453
Believe what you like.
I did see him.

739
00:53:05,722 --> 00:53:08,282
It's your business.
You shouldn't ask me.

740
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,992
You said you ran down the hill

741
00:53:12,169 --> 00:53:13,363
to stop the bus.

742
00:53:13,603 --> 00:53:16,731
Was the bus always in sight?

743
00:53:18,508 --> 00:53:19,497
Yes.

744
00:53:19,542 --> 00:53:20,406
Why hesitate?

745
00:53:20,735 --> 00:53:21,724
I was thinking.

746
00:53:22,137 --> 00:53:23,196
You have doubts?!

747
00:53:23,239 --> 00:53:24,069
Objection!

748
00:53:24,106 --> 00:53:25,094
Don't hound him.

749
00:53:25,473 --> 00:53:27,839
Rephrase the question.

750
00:53:28,677 --> 00:53:30,907
How long did it take you
to go down the hill?

751
00:53:31,313 --> 00:53:34,180
And was the bus always in sight?

752
00:53:34,516 --> 00:53:35,504
For a while my view

753
00:53:35,649 --> 00:53:37,776
was blocked by the hill.

754
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:40,552
Could it be that another bus

755
00:53:40,955 --> 00:53:43,219
overtook the first one at that point?

756
00:53:43,424 --> 00:53:44,652
There was only one bus!

757
00:53:44,825 --> 00:53:45,813
You're lying!

758
00:53:45,858 --> 00:53:46,756
Sustained!

759
00:53:46,793 --> 00:53:50,422
Defence should rephrase his question.

760
00:53:52,131 --> 00:53:53,290
Could you be mistaken?

761
00:53:53,532 --> 00:53:54,522
No!

762
00:53:54,834 --> 00:53:58,098
There are four different bus routes
on that road.

763
00:53:58,437 --> 00:54:00,564
On two routes,

764
00:54:00,772 --> 00:54:01,966
the buses run every five minutes.

765
00:54:02,274 --> 00:54:04,902
The other two,
the buses run every six minutes.

766
00:54:05,143 --> 00:54:06,440
So 88 buses run back and forth

767
00:54:06,612 --> 00:54:08,203
on that road every hour.

768
00:54:08,713 --> 00:54:11,375
That's more than one bus a minute.

769
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:13,238
So what?

770
00:54:13,284 --> 00:54:15,343
How long did it take you

771
00:54:15,653 --> 00:54:16,642
to go down the hill?

772
00:54:16,954 --> 00:54:17,942
About two minutes.

773
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:19,043
Exactly?

774
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:20,145
Two minutes and half.

775
00:54:20,191 --> 00:54:21,680
So at most eight or night buses

776
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:23,787
could have passed by.

777
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:26,893
But you said there was one.
I say you're lying.

778
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:29,296
Don't you know the buses are always late?

779
00:54:35,938 --> 00:54:38,270
All right. Let's give you the benefit of the
doubt.

780
00:54:38,574 --> 00:54:39,938
Assume there was one bus

781
00:54:40,208 --> 00:54:41,972
and you could see it

782
00:54:42,177 --> 00:54:43,200
all the time.

783
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:47,078
Which part was clearly visible
to you?

784
00:54:47,148 --> 00:54:48,137
The body.

785
00:54:48,182 --> 00:54:49,171
How much of the body?

786
00:54:49,584 --> 00:54:50,572
All of it!

787
00:54:51,051 --> 00:54:52,076
You're lying!

788
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,709
What's he doing?

789
00:54:54,755 --> 00:54:56,916
You could see only one side of this bus.

790
00:54:57,257 --> 00:54:59,555
At most, only half of it.

791
00:54:59,926 --> 00:55:01,119
You couldn't see the other half.

792
00:55:01,394 --> 00:55:03,260
Am I right?

793
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:04,718
Yes.

794
00:55:04,964 --> 00:55:06,226
And anything

795
00:55:06,532 --> 00:55:08,466
could have happened

796
00:55:08,701 --> 00:55:09,690
on the side you couldn't see.

797
00:55:09,735 --> 00:55:10,633
Yes.

798
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:12,136
So if someone jumped off,

799
00:55:12,337 --> 00:55:13,965
you couldn't see him, could you?

800
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:16,129
No.

801
00:55:16,241 --> 00:55:17,230
Speak louder.

802
00:55:17,976 --> 00:55:19,466
I could have jumped off, he couldn't.

803
00:55:19,911 --> 00:55:22,072
Just answer the question.

804
00:55:22,546 --> 00:55:24,139
I mean it!

805
00:55:24,315 --> 00:55:25,304
You try jumping from a moving bus!

806
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:27,649
Control yourself!

807
00:55:28,385 --> 00:55:29,909
If that's not him
why did he bribe me?

808
00:55:30,087 --> 00:55:31,076
Why would he do that?

809
00:55:31,188 --> 00:55:33,348
He offered me money to let him go.

810
00:55:33,523 --> 00:55:35,048
If it was you and

811
00:55:35,325 --> 00:55:36,791
someone pointed a gun at you,

812
00:55:37,126 --> 00:55:38,320
what would you do?

813
00:55:38,361 --> 00:55:39,294
Objection!

814
00:55:39,329 --> 00:55:40,226
Objection overruled!

815
00:55:40,263 --> 00:55:41,252
Answer him!

816
00:55:41,597 --> 00:55:43,428
I'd give him all my money.

817
00:55:43,633 --> 00:55:45,328
That's what happened

818
00:55:45,601 --> 00:55:46,659
to my client.

819
00:55:47,369 --> 00:55:48,358
Am I right?

820
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:50,266
No, I'd already identified myself.

821
00:55:50,506 --> 00:55:52,268
There are many cases where

822
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,463
criminals pose as policemen.

823
00:55:53,608 --> 00:55:54,596
Sustained!

824
00:55:55,343 --> 00:55:56,332
Court will ignore that remark.

825
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:58,475
Confine yourself

826
00:55:58,679 --> 00:56:00,477
to this case.

827
00:56:00,882 --> 00:56:01,870
I'm sorry!

828
00:56:02,516 --> 00:56:03,505
Consider this,

829
00:56:03,784 --> 00:56:04,773
a businessman

830
00:56:05,052 --> 00:56:07,043
is carrying company cash on a bus.

831
00:56:07,388 --> 00:56:10,254
A policeman chasing robbers stops

832
00:56:10,623 --> 00:56:11,613
the bus and points a gun at him.

833
00:56:12,026 --> 00:56:14,391
So the businessman thinks
the policeman is a crook.

834
00:56:14,728 --> 00:56:15,717
So he tells the policeman

835
00:56:15,762 --> 00:56:17,923
to take the cash and let him go.

836
00:56:18,865 --> 00:56:21,390
Inspector Chan, isn't that right?

837
00:56:23,535 --> 00:56:24,524
Objection!

838
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:26,697
The witness needn't answer.

839
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:30,131
We already know the answer.

840
00:56:30,374 --> 00:56:31,740
He doesn't need to say it.

841
00:56:32,611 --> 00:56:33,600
I conclude.

842
00:56:38,249 --> 00:56:39,238
Wonderful!

843
00:56:39,283 --> 00:56:40,079
Now what?

844
00:56:40,118 --> 00:56:41,106
I know what to do.

845
00:56:41,184 --> 00:56:42,447
He'll get off the hook.

846
00:56:42,754 --> 00:56:43,743
He won't.

847
00:56:48,525 --> 00:56:50,618
Your Honour, we request an adjournment.

848
00:56:50,827 --> 00:56:52,088
Our prime witness was delayed.

849
00:56:52,261 --> 00:56:53,251
Objection!

850
00:56:53,296 --> 00:56:54,194
The Crown has failed

851
00:56:54,231 --> 00:56:55,561
to establish a case.

852
00:56:56,031 --> 00:56:58,592
There is insufficient evidence
to convict my client.

853
00:56:58,901 --> 00:57:01,028
I request a dismissal.
Your Honour.

854
00:57:01,203 --> 00:57:03,330
We have taped evidence

855
00:57:03,506 --> 00:57:04,495
from our witness.

856
00:57:04,573 --> 00:57:06,472
Tapes can't be accepted as evidence.

857
00:57:06,841 --> 00:57:08,639
That tape is key to this case.

858
00:57:08,811 --> 00:57:09,799
Objection.

859
00:57:10,645 --> 00:57:11,737
I will not adjourn or postpone

860
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:14,080
the hearing.

861
00:57:14,749 --> 00:57:16,875
That would be unfair to the defendant.

862
00:57:17,484 --> 00:57:19,042
I will grant him bail.

863
00:57:19,254 --> 00:57:20,982
But we will

864
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:22,678
hear that tape first.

865
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:35,501
Please turn up the volume.
It's a cheap tape.

866
00:57:35,902 --> 00:57:36,891
Thanks.

867
00:58:00,623 --> 00:58:01,648
Wait! I didn't erase that.

868
00:58:03,893 --> 00:58:04,882
Just let it play!

869
00:58:07,463 --> 00:58:08,487
It's coming up!

870
00:58:14,403 --> 00:58:15,392
Oh, you! That hurts!

871
00:58:15,904 --> 00:58:16,893
What did I do?

872
00:58:16,939 --> 00:58:19,806
You really poked me!

873
00:58:21,642 --> 00:58:23,406
You're breaking it!

874
00:58:23,579 --> 00:58:25,136
Don't push too hard!

875
00:58:26,113 --> 00:58:28,081
What an ugly thing!

876
00:58:28,249 --> 00:58:29,341
Go away!

877
00:58:30,017 --> 00:58:31,813
It's the only one I got. It's my treasure.

878
00:58:32,018 --> 00:58:33,008
It's only a cactus!

879
00:58:33,454 --> 00:58:34,443
What's happening?

880
00:58:34,488 --> 00:58:36,512
You got me all wet!

881
00:58:36,756 --> 00:58:38,018
Let me wipe it for you.

882
00:58:39,826 --> 00:58:41,987
Please, no more! No, don't!

883
00:58:42,461 --> 00:58:44,157
That was only orange juice!

884
00:58:45,332 --> 00:58:48,266
That wasn't what you think.

885
00:58:48,534 --> 00:58:50,502
Be gentle! That hurt!

886
00:58:52,137 --> 00:58:56,369
The sofa's hard. It's not very comfy.
Let's go to bed now.

887
00:58:57,675 --> 00:58:59,006
Let's go to bed.

888
00:58:59,345 --> 00:59:00,333
OK. But where can I sleep?

889
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,068
On my bed.

890
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,269
And you?

891
00:59:03,715 --> 00:59:04,841
Next to you.

892
00:59:05,383 --> 00:59:08,613
You're so protective.
It's exciting!

893
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,312
Come on!

894
00:59:16,093 --> 00:59:17,082
Please be cooperative.

895
00:59:17,628 --> 00:59:18,616
Stand back, please.

896
00:59:21,164 --> 00:59:21,822
No photographs!

897
00:59:22,198 --> 00:59:23,187
Ka-kui!

898
00:59:25,735 --> 00:59:27,965
I want a written report.

899
00:59:31,107 --> 00:59:32,096
Boss!

900
00:59:32,141 --> 00:59:32,868
Here!

901
00:59:32,908 --> 00:59:34,876
No pictures!

902
00:59:35,076 --> 00:59:36,065
Get back.

903
00:59:41,283 --> 00:59:42,272
John, reserve a room

904
00:59:42,317 --> 00:59:44,648
at the country club.

905
00:59:44,952 --> 00:59:47,318
We're going to celebrate.

906
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:49,478
I'm leaving now.

907
00:59:49,823 --> 00:59:50,811
Thank you very much!

908
01:00:04,203 --> 01:00:05,601
Next time let's hire him as prosecutor.

909
01:00:09,808 --> 01:00:12,241
This is Crime Story.
I'm so happy to see you all again.

910
01:00:12,476 --> 01:00:13,910
Our guest today is

911
01:00:14,146 --> 01:00:16,340
a brave police officer.

912
01:00:16,747 --> 01:00:18,238
Sitting next to me is

913
01:00:18,417 --> 01:00:21,749
Inspector Chan Ka-kui.

914
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:23,207
Hello!

915
01:00:23,253 --> 01:00:24,016
Hello!

916
01:00:24,055 --> 01:00:25,044
Hello! Hello everyone!

917
01:00:25,356 --> 01:00:29,349
After cracking down on the biggest
drug racket in Hong Kong,

918
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:30,748
you've become very popular

919
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:33,325
amongst the people.

920
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:35,426
Would you share this particular

921
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:37,188
experience with us?

922
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,459
The success of this operation

923
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:43,262
was due to team work.

924
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:44,801
I was just a part of it.

925
01:00:45,207 --> 01:00:47,538
We were well prepared for the operation.

926
01:00:48,476 --> 01:00:49,910
What makes your department so special

927
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:51,869
in the police force?

928
01:00:52,647 --> 01:00:54,512
To be one of us,

929
01:00:54,748 --> 01:00:55,738
you have to be

930
01:00:56,017 --> 01:00:57,848
strong, alert,

931
01:00:58,152 --> 01:00:59,675
smart, and...

932
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:00,585
Boss.

933
01:01:00,621 --> 01:01:01,610
What's up?!

934
01:01:02,122 --> 01:01:03,111
His photo is all over

935
01:01:03,357 --> 01:01:06,292
the papers and magazines.

936
01:01:06,793 --> 01:01:09,260
And he had won the
Brave Policeman Arrests Drug Tycoon

937
01:01:20,372 --> 01:01:23,206
and our Thai source is out of stock.

938
01:01:23,441 --> 01:01:25,534
What? Are they crazy?

939
01:01:26,712 --> 01:01:29,305
They've sold everything to Uncle Joe.

940
01:01:29,814 --> 01:01:31,075
They want hard cash.

941
01:01:32,984 --> 01:01:34,245
Boss, Mr Cheung is here.

942
01:01:35,085 --> 01:01:36,074
Please come in.

943
01:01:37,921 --> 01:01:38,910
Mr Chu, I've received your cheque,

944
01:01:40,024 --> 01:01:41,615
thanks a lot!

945
01:01:41,958 --> 01:01:42,948
I should thank you!

946
01:01:44,428 --> 01:01:45,416
How's my case now?

947
01:01:46,295 --> 01:01:47,489
All evidence must remain

948
01:01:47,698 --> 01:01:49,289
with the court

949
01:01:49,432 --> 01:01:51,161
until the case ends.

950
01:01:51,367 --> 01:01:52,799
What does that include?

951
01:01:53,102 --> 01:01:55,036
Your passport and bank account.

952
01:01:55,271 --> 01:01:56,828
You can't use them now.

953
01:01:57,139 --> 01:01:58,402
If you're found guilty,

954
01:01:58,674 --> 01:02:01,335
your assets will be confiscated.

955
01:02:01,777 --> 01:02:04,644
And besides, the bastards could jail me.

956
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:05,969
Phone call for you, Boss.

957
01:02:07,081 --> 01:02:08,070
Excuse me!

958
01:02:11,085 --> 01:02:12,575
Salina.

959
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:15,645
It's boring here.
I want to go somewhere else.

960
01:02:15,956 --> 01:02:17,115
Not just yet.

961
01:02:17,791 --> 01:02:19,019
Can I come and see you?

962
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:21,989
Not now. You should stay where you are.

963
01:02:23,063 --> 01:02:24,461
The police are looking for you.

964
01:02:24,697 --> 01:02:26,790
I'm planning a trip to Europe for you.

965
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,631
Once you're there, you'll be fine.

966
01:02:30,403 --> 01:02:32,233
You just have to wait.

967
01:02:32,471 --> 01:02:33,529
It's for your own good.

968
01:02:45,183 --> 01:02:46,172
Where were we?

969
01:02:46,284 --> 01:02:48,514
We were lucky

970
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:49,707
to bail you out.

971
01:02:49,853 --> 01:02:51,344
It would have been different

972
01:02:51,522 --> 01:02:53,785
if they had found Salina.

973
01:02:54,324 --> 01:02:56,792
I doubt they'll ever be able to find her.

974
01:02:57,094 --> 01:02:58,083
Very well.

975
01:02:58,128 --> 01:02:59,754
I must leave. See you.

976
01:03:00,429 --> 01:03:01,590
Bye.

977
01:03:03,566 --> 01:03:05,591
Your lawyer is right.

978
01:03:05,968 --> 01:03:07,492
Salina's a big problem.

979
01:03:07,803 --> 01:03:09,430
You can't hide her forever.

980
01:03:11,306 --> 01:03:12,296
True.

981
01:03:12,508 --> 01:03:15,340
Snake Eyes says that stupid cop
is looking for Salina everywhere.

982
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:17,401
We should send her abroad.

983
01:03:17,879 --> 01:03:19,608
On a one-way ticket.

984
01:03:21,415 --> 01:03:23,680
Let's use that stupid cop

985
01:03:24,052 --> 01:03:25,177
to kill Salina.

986
01:03:28,689 --> 01:03:31,351
Be sensible.

987
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:34,026
Chicks like her aren't difficult to get.

988
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,129
Inspector Man wants to see you.

989
01:03:39,632 --> 01:03:40,621
Let him in.

990
01:03:41,701 --> 01:03:42,724
You paid him off, didn't you?

991
01:03:43,235 --> 01:03:44,225
Yes, I did.

992
01:03:44,303 --> 01:03:47,430
But he says he wants
to retire and start a business.

993
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,230
What does that mean?

994
01:03:49,342 --> 01:03:51,138
He wants more money!

995
01:03:51,409 --> 01:03:52,535
This way, Inspector Man.

996
01:03:53,744 --> 01:03:54,734
Hello!

997
01:03:54,779 --> 01:03:55,438
Hello.

998
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:56,276
Sit down.

999
01:03:56,314 --> 01:03:57,302
I'm OK.

1000
01:03:57,681 --> 01:03:58,670
I came to see you about...

1001
01:03:58,816 --> 01:03:59,806
Yes, I know.

1002
01:04:00,352 --> 01:04:02,683
You want to retire and start a business.

1003
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:04,208
Good idea.

1004
01:04:04,454 --> 01:04:05,444
Thanks for your money.

1005
01:04:05,789 --> 01:04:08,052
I know you're a smart guy.

1006
01:04:09,025 --> 01:04:10,857
But I want one more favour.

1007
01:04:11,327 --> 01:04:12,316
What is it?

1008
01:04:12,462 --> 01:04:16,125
I want Chan Ka-kui to disappear for good.

1009
01:04:23,972 --> 01:04:27,271
You want to be a hero.
I'll make you a tragic hero.

1010
01:04:58,504 --> 01:04:59,493
I'll book you for that!

1011
01:05:02,675 --> 01:05:04,575
Hi, there! Follow me.

1012
01:05:05,577 --> 01:05:06,566
Inspector Chan!

1013
01:05:07,011 --> 01:05:08,774
If anything happens,

1014
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:09,936
you can reach me...

1015
01:05:10,014 --> 01:05:11,003
Reach you with telegram.

1016
01:05:11,049 --> 01:05:12,037
My home.

1017
01:05:12,282 --> 01:05:13,272
But you're on patrol.

1018
01:05:14,586 --> 01:05:17,179
That doesn't mean
I can't pass by my house.

1019
01:05:27,697 --> 01:05:31,861
I'm going to the toilet, you stay here.

1020
01:05:32,802 --> 01:05:34,531
Don't stay there for too long.

1021
01:05:37,906 --> 01:05:38,895
Hello, Police Station.

1022
01:05:39,408 --> 01:05:41,432
You called, Inspector Chan?

1023
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:43,805
Of course, any news?

1024
01:05:44,045 --> 01:05:46,275
On Salina? I need more time.

1025
01:05:46,681 --> 01:05:48,671
It's not easy, you should know.

1026
01:05:48,916 --> 01:05:50,748
Then you won't get paid.

1027
01:05:51,286 --> 01:05:52,377
I know.

1028
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,309
I'm doing my best.

1029
01:05:54,488 --> 01:05:55,785
What?

1030
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:57,212
Wait a second!

1031
01:05:59,592 --> 01:06:00,651
Police Station, hold the line.

1032
01:06:03,129 --> 01:06:05,256
Three more days, Snake Eyes.

1033
01:06:05,765 --> 01:06:06,754
What?

1034
01:06:09,601 --> 01:06:10,933
That's not enough time.

1035
01:06:11,271 --> 01:06:12,636
What?

1036
01:06:12,938 --> 01:06:13,927
I'll give you four days.

1037
01:06:13,972 --> 01:06:16,237
Or you'll be in trouble,
when I get back to town.

1038
01:06:16,775 --> 01:06:18,868
I'm hanging up now!

1039
01:06:21,445 --> 01:06:22,435
Can I help?

1040
01:06:22,481 --> 01:06:24,243
I've been waiting for ages.

1041
01:06:27,118 --> 01:06:28,779
You want to speak Inspector Chan? Hold on.

1042
01:06:29,687 --> 01:06:31,051
Phone, Inspector Chan.

1043
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:33,279
Right, thanks!

1044
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:36,550
Hello, this is Inspector Chan.

1045
01:06:36,693 --> 01:06:37,683
It's me.

1046
01:06:37,728 --> 01:06:38,284
May.

1047
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:39,818
Who was that?

1048
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:42,658
That rude guy?
Wait. I'll give him a lesson.

1049
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:45,993
Didn't I tell you to be polite on the phone?

1050
01:06:46,201 --> 01:06:47,190
You're so rude!

1051
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,493
I'm really sorry!

1052
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:51,636
Right. I just told him off.

1053
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:53,199
How's it going?

1054
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:54,498
What are you doing now?

1055
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:56,265
Me?

1056
01:06:57,178 --> 01:06:58,737
Now? Now I'm talking to you.

1057
01:06:58,947 --> 01:06:59,935
Have you had lunch?

1058
01:07:00,148 --> 01:07:01,445
Not yet.

1059
01:07:02,116 --> 01:07:04,846
I'm cooking some noodles.
Have you eaten, then?

1060
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:06,108
No.

1061
01:07:07,554 --> 01:07:09,648
Wait a minute.

1062
01:07:11,558 --> 01:07:12,650
Police Station, hold the line.

1063
01:07:14,428 --> 01:07:15,417
May. I'm back.

1064
01:07:15,462 --> 01:07:18,191
Mum wants to have dinner
with us on Sunday.

1065
01:07:18,964 --> 01:07:20,489
Is that so? That sounds great.

1066
01:07:20,701 --> 01:07:21,689
Hold on.

1067
01:07:21,734 --> 01:07:22,564
Police Station.

1068
01:07:22,601 --> 01:07:23,590
My husband...

1069
01:07:23,736 --> 01:07:24,725
Your husband what?

1070
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:26,030
He's beating me up.

1071
01:07:26,505 --> 01:07:28,062
Who's beating who up?

1072
01:07:28,239 --> 01:07:29,638
My husband's beating me up!

1073
01:07:29,942 --> 01:07:31,273
You husband's beating you?

1074
01:07:31,509 --> 01:07:33,875
Don't cry. I'll put you through
to a different department.

1075
01:07:34,879 --> 01:07:36,710
I'm coming on Sunday,

1076
01:07:36,948 --> 01:07:38,006
wait a second.

1077
01:07:38,516 --> 01:07:40,176
The line's busy.

1078
01:07:40,618 --> 01:07:42,482
Police Station, how can I help?

1079
01:07:42,953 --> 01:07:43,942
I'm missing a cow.

1080
01:07:44,154 --> 01:07:48,420
Hold the line.
I'll get you the right department.

1081
01:07:48,926 --> 01:07:49,914
The line's still busy.

1082
01:07:49,959 --> 01:07:50,584
Police Station.

1083
01:07:50,626 --> 01:07:51,389
I was raped!

1084
01:07:51,428 --> 01:07:53,452
Really?!
I have to write down the details.

1085
01:08:00,102 --> 01:08:01,091
When were you raped?

1086
01:08:01,169 --> 01:08:02,865
I wasn't raped, but my husband's mad.

1087
01:08:04,272 --> 01:08:05,569
Oh! It's you,

1088
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:06,765
I'm still connecting your call.

1089
01:08:06,809 --> 01:08:07,502
It's taking so long!

1090
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:09,908
This is a big police station. Wait!

1091
01:08:12,814 --> 01:08:13,803
Who's been raped?

1092
01:08:13,849 --> 01:08:14,974
Me!

1093
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:16,705
I'm missing a cow!

1094
01:08:17,819 --> 01:08:18,876
When were you raped?

1095
01:08:19,086 --> 01:08:20,075
Last year!

1096
01:08:20,187 --> 01:08:21,778
Why didn't you report it?

1097
01:08:22,188 --> 01:08:24,123
Are there any pills I can take?

1098
01:08:24,325 --> 01:08:25,416
Pills?!

1099
01:08:26,259 --> 01:08:27,248
I'll find out for you.

1100
01:08:28,496 --> 01:08:30,122
Hello, Police Station.

1101
01:08:30,263 --> 01:08:31,252
I'm missing a cow.

1102
01:08:31,297 --> 01:08:32,263
All right.

1103
01:08:32,297 --> 01:08:34,163
But you need to bring in
a photo of the cow first.

1104
01:08:36,368 --> 01:08:37,835
Hello.

1105
01:08:40,472 --> 01:08:42,565
May, I'm very busy.

1106
01:08:43,307 --> 01:08:44,798
She wants me to name a place for dinner?

1107
01:08:45,411 --> 01:08:46,400
Give me a minute first.

1108
01:08:47,345 --> 01:08:49,541
Hello.

1109
01:08:49,581 --> 01:08:50,444
Where shall we go?

1110
01:08:50,481 --> 01:08:51,470
The Family Planning Clinic.

1111
01:08:52,116 --> 01:08:54,175
Take a double portion of contraception pills.

1112
01:08:54,352 --> 01:08:55,478
Free.

1113
01:08:57,121 --> 01:08:58,109
May.

1114
01:08:58,155 --> 01:09:00,181
Tell your own mum to take
contraception pills!

1115
01:09:00,792 --> 01:09:02,759
What?! May!

1116
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:04,683
I was saying that to someone else.

1117
01:09:06,897 --> 01:09:08,022
Hello?

1118
01:09:14,437 --> 01:09:15,426
Hello?

1119
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:20,237
Tell my mum to take contraception pills.

1120
01:09:20,408 --> 01:09:21,501
My mum doesn't need those pills.

1121
01:10:35,878 --> 01:10:36,867
Police Station.

1122
01:10:37,212 --> 01:10:38,769
I'm testing the line, bye!

1123
01:10:40,048 --> 01:10:41,036
What?!

1124
01:10:54,561 --> 01:10:55,585
Stuck in traffic?

1125
01:10:57,330 --> 01:10:58,354
No, not traffic.

1126
01:10:59,031 --> 01:11:00,020
You're late.

1127
01:11:00,065 --> 01:11:02,330
If the roads were congested,
I wouldn't be here at all.

1128
01:11:03,769 --> 01:11:05,202
You're having dinner with us.

1129
01:11:05,437 --> 01:11:06,904
Mum hates it when anyone's late!

1130
01:11:07,606 --> 01:11:08,732
May, listen.

1131
01:11:08,908 --> 01:11:11,034
I've been waiting all day.

1132
01:11:11,277 --> 01:11:13,040
You're off that case.

1133
01:11:13,144 --> 01:11:14,133
Forget about it.

1134
01:11:14,178 --> 01:11:15,167
I can't.

1135
01:11:17,849 --> 01:11:18,838
I need to make a phone call.

1136
01:11:20,784 --> 01:11:23,083
Hold on to the car.
The hand brake doesn't work.

1137
01:11:24,254 --> 01:11:25,243
Don't let go.

1138
01:11:36,365 --> 01:11:38,560
It's me, Snake Eyes.

1139
01:11:38,768 --> 01:11:39,757
Chu Tu's hiding that witness

1140
01:11:39,969 --> 01:11:41,266
you're looking for

1141
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:43,502
in his Kowloon villa.

1142
01:11:44,407 --> 01:11:45,395
You sure?

1143
01:11:46,608 --> 01:11:47,597
Better hurry.

1144
01:11:48,477 --> 01:11:50,307
They don't plan to keep her alive.

1145
01:11:50,745 --> 01:11:51,734
Is it true?

1146
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:54,112
Would I lie to you? Hurry up!

1147
01:11:58,720 --> 01:11:59,708
May.

1148
01:11:59,753 --> 01:12:00,651
Are you coming?!

1149
01:12:00,688 --> 01:12:02,553
That was Snake Eyes.

1150
01:12:02,756 --> 01:12:03,745
I know where they're hiding Salina.

1151
01:12:04,558 --> 01:12:06,048
Don't go!

1152
01:12:06,293 --> 01:12:07,919
If Chu Tu kills her, he'll go free.

1153
01:12:08,127 --> 01:12:09,459
I've got to save her.

1154
01:12:09,763 --> 01:12:11,753
I can't let her die.

1155
01:12:12,265 --> 01:12:13,254
What's up?

1156
01:12:13,299 --> 01:12:14,823
Your car!

1157
01:12:21,974 --> 01:12:22,963
What now?!

1158
01:12:23,008 --> 01:12:23,997
Taxi!

1159
01:12:25,477 --> 01:12:26,774
Call someone to tow the car away.

1160
01:12:27,579 --> 01:12:29,842
And say sorry to your mum for me.

1161
01:12:31,183 --> 01:12:32,809
Be careful!

1162
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:40,980
Keep the change.

1163
01:12:41,025 --> 01:12:42,014
Thanks!

1164
01:13:54,223 --> 01:13:55,213
What happened?

1165
01:13:55,259 --> 01:13:57,658
I don't know what they're up to.

1166
01:13:57,827 --> 01:13:58,816
Is anyone else here?

1167
01:13:58,861 --> 01:14:00,853
No one. They just disappeared.

1168
01:14:01,464 --> 01:14:02,954
Now you know what Chu Tu is like.

1169
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:05,097
If you had listened to me,

1170
01:14:05,702 --> 01:14:07,067
you wouldn't be in danger.

1171
01:14:08,737 --> 01:14:09,795
It's lucky I got here.

1172
01:14:11,007 --> 01:14:12,940
Otherwise, you'd be dead.

1173
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:19,568
Let's get out of here.

1174
01:14:20,548 --> 01:14:21,538
Go.

1175
01:15:11,294 --> 01:15:12,386
Stop!

1176
01:15:19,302 --> 01:15:20,290
Step aside.

1177
01:15:24,073 --> 01:15:25,062
How did you know I was here?

1178
01:15:26,509 --> 01:15:27,975
I have my ways.

1179
01:15:36,651 --> 01:15:37,639
You can't be...

1180
01:15:38,252 --> 01:15:39,241
Surprised?!

1181
01:15:40,922 --> 01:15:42,479
That's not the only surprise.

1182
01:15:43,490 --> 01:15:45,117
We were supposed to kill him.

1183
01:15:47,861 --> 01:15:48,986
That's right.

1184
01:15:49,829 --> 01:15:50,819
The boss wants us to use a police gun.

1185
01:15:50,964 --> 01:15:53,989
One cop kills another.

1186
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:55,958
What a perfect set-up!

1187
01:15:58,204 --> 01:15:59,192
Who's killing who?

1188
01:16:11,983 --> 01:16:12,972
Let's get out of here!

1189
01:16:19,890 --> 01:16:20,878
Move it.

1190
01:16:27,364 --> 01:16:29,297
No, I can't do it!

1191
01:16:32,067 --> 01:16:33,057
No!

1192
01:16:35,838 --> 01:16:37,100
Jump!

1193
01:16:43,212 --> 01:16:44,577
Move it!

1194
01:16:50,151 --> 01:16:51,140
Stop!

1195
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:56,578
Go get her!

1196
01:16:57,958 --> 01:17:03,123
You little prick! We'll teach you.
You'll wish you'd never interfered.

1197
01:17:11,070 --> 01:17:12,059
That's enough!

1198
01:17:14,172 --> 01:17:15,697
Take care of him. I'll go down.

1199
01:17:17,042 --> 01:17:19,305
Ka-kui didn't shoot Inspector Man.

1200
01:17:19,712 --> 01:17:20,906
We can't take your word for it.

1201
01:17:21,213 --> 01:17:22,201
We need evidence.

1202
01:17:22,247 --> 01:17:23,179
If he didn't do it,

1203
01:17:23,214 --> 01:17:24,408
Where did he go with his gun?

1204
01:17:24,749 --> 01:17:26,410
The bullet that killed Man was fired

1205
01:17:26,618 --> 01:17:27,846
from Ka-kui's gun.

1206
01:17:27,886 --> 01:17:28,852
Explain it.

1207
01:17:28,886 --> 01:17:30,946
Policemen make lots of enemies.

1208
01:17:31,189 --> 01:17:32,815
Someone is trying to frame Ka-kui.

1209
01:17:33,223 --> 01:17:35,987
If it were anyone else but Ka-kui,

1210
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:37,182
would you feel the same?

1211
01:17:37,461 --> 01:17:40,988
You're the boss.
Don't always go by the book!

1212
01:17:41,231 --> 01:17:42,857
Show some feelings for your men.

1213
01:17:43,232 --> 01:17:44,221
I don't want people thinking if a cop kills,

1214
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:45,794
he gets away with it.

1215
01:17:45,968 --> 01:17:47,936
There'll be no cover up!

1216
01:17:48,137 --> 01:17:49,933
One law for all.

1217
01:17:50,639 --> 01:17:51,834
You want to nail him

1218
01:17:52,141 --> 01:17:54,199
even more than the crooks!

1219
01:17:54,609 --> 01:17:55,598
Enough!

1220
01:17:57,279 --> 01:18:00,577
If you were me, what would you do?

1221
01:18:36,315 --> 01:18:37,713
Hi, May.

1222
01:18:43,853 --> 01:18:44,843
I know.

1223
01:18:47,691 --> 01:18:49,455
I'll wait for you.

1224
01:18:55,899 --> 01:18:59,197
One Cop Kills Another. Policeman Is Killed

1225
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:02,359
What should we do?

1226
01:19:06,508 --> 01:19:07,839
My mum is really worried about you.

1227
01:19:21,055 --> 01:19:24,820
Ka-kui, be careful!

1228
01:19:40,839 --> 01:19:41,829
Ka-kui's back!

1229
01:19:53,284 --> 01:19:54,273
Ka-kui!

1230
01:19:54,319 --> 01:19:55,307
Ka-kui!

1231
01:20:00,557 --> 01:20:01,546
Ka-kui!

1232
01:20:03,093 --> 01:20:04,788
I didn't kill him.

1233
01:20:04,995 --> 01:20:05,983
We believe you.

1234
01:20:06,462 --> 01:20:08,020
But where have you been?

1235
01:20:10,366 --> 01:20:11,355
I don't know.

1236
01:20:11,467 --> 01:20:12,661
You must remember something.

1237
01:20:13,603 --> 01:20:15,867
Were you drunk or with your girlfriend?

1238
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,037
I was fighting Chu Tu's men.

1239
01:20:20,642 --> 01:20:22,542
Inspector Man appeared
and pointed his gun at me.

1240
01:20:22,844 --> 01:20:25,779
They took my revolver
and shot Man with it.

1241
01:20:27,181 --> 01:20:28,580
That's all I remember.

1242
01:20:29,083 --> 01:20:30,073
Nothing else?

1243
01:20:30,252 --> 01:20:31,718
You disliked Man,

1244
01:20:31,952 --> 01:20:33,681
and the bullet was from your gun.

1245
01:20:33,888 --> 01:20:34,877
Don't you know?

1246
01:20:35,322 --> 01:20:36,380
I wouldn't kill him over

1247
01:20:37,158 --> 01:20:39,125
some petty differences.

1248
01:20:39,259 --> 01:20:40,318
Who would believe that?

1249
01:20:40,528 --> 01:20:41,687
We must have proof!

1250
01:20:41,895 --> 01:20:43,328
That's how the law works.

1251
01:20:45,365 --> 01:20:46,354
But I'm glad you're back.

1252
01:20:46,499 --> 01:20:47,693
Give me your gun.

1253
01:20:51,104 --> 01:20:52,093
Call Homicide.

1254
01:20:52,237 --> 01:20:54,296
Tell them

1255
01:20:54,506 --> 01:20:55,495
we have the suspect.

1256
01:20:57,810 --> 01:20:59,436
Ka-kui, don't worry.

1257
01:21:00,111 --> 01:21:01,909
We'll do our very best to help you.

1258
01:21:04,182 --> 01:21:05,171
Lock him up.

1259
01:21:06,151 --> 01:21:08,846
And charge him...with murder.

1260
01:21:13,091 --> 01:21:14,079
How could you?!

1261
01:21:17,294 --> 01:21:18,283
Freeze!

1262
01:21:18,328 --> 01:21:19,693
Ka-kui, what are you doing?

1263
01:21:20,464 --> 01:21:22,193
I didn't kill anyone!

1264
01:21:23,567 --> 01:21:25,431
Don't you believe me?

1265
01:21:25,935 --> 01:21:26,924
I believe you.

1266
01:21:27,437 --> 01:21:29,097
But based on the evidence,

1267
01:21:29,271 --> 01:21:30,260
I must charge you.

1268
01:21:30,406 --> 01:21:31,997
Can't you see I was framed?

1269
01:21:32,942 --> 01:21:34,239
You're bloody stupid!

1270
01:21:34,477 --> 01:21:36,068
I'll conduct a very thorough investigation!

1271
01:21:36,945 --> 01:21:38,573
Don't give me that!

1272
01:21:38,746 --> 01:21:39,906
Let him go!

1273
01:21:42,649 --> 01:21:43,639
What?

1274
01:21:44,018 --> 01:21:45,780
What you are doing is dangerous!

1275
01:21:46,086 --> 01:21:47,314
Dangerous for him!

1276
01:21:47,955 --> 01:21:49,321
While we risk our lives out there,

1277
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:51,615
he's sitting back thinking of chicks.

1278
01:21:51,959 --> 01:21:53,118
We've arrested so many bad guys,
but he's never satisfied.

1279
01:21:53,392 --> 01:21:54,883
He just considers the result.

1280
01:21:55,462 --> 01:21:57,520
And he uses dirty tricks to catch Chu Tu

1281
01:21:57,730 --> 01:22:00,130
and that stupid idea of protecting the witness.
So easy?!

1282
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:03,768
You only have to open your mouth
and we have to risk our lives!

1283
01:22:03,802 --> 01:22:04,565
Ka-kui!

1284
01:22:04,604 --> 01:22:05,593
Shut up!

1285
01:22:06,472 --> 01:22:08,336
You got promoted at our expense.

1286
01:22:08,773 --> 01:22:10,207
Have you ever thought of us?

1287
01:22:11,076 --> 01:22:12,236
If any of us dies,

1288
01:22:12,844 --> 01:22:15,074
you need only write a report
and turn up for the funeral.

1289
01:22:16,481 --> 01:22:18,414
We have families, too.

1290
01:22:19,283 --> 01:22:20,979
If it wasn't for us, you'd never have

1291
01:22:21,486 --> 01:22:23,214
this office and all this other crap!

1292
01:22:23,487 --> 01:22:24,818
Ka-kui.

1293
01:22:25,090 --> 01:22:26,818
Go away!

1294
01:22:27,358 --> 01:22:28,620
Come any closer and I'll blow his head off!

1295
01:22:29,159 --> 01:22:30,559
Ka-kui, don't do that!

1296
01:22:31,195 --> 01:22:32,354
Open the door!

1297
01:22:33,730 --> 01:22:34,719
Don't move!

1298
01:22:35,633 --> 01:22:36,621
Don't push me!

1299
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,430
Keep back!

1300
01:22:40,002 --> 01:22:42,563
Don't worry about me. I know what I'm doing!

1301
01:22:47,276 --> 01:22:50,074
Ka-kui's holding the Super hostage!

1302
01:22:51,212 --> 01:22:52,202
What?

1303
01:22:52,247 --> 01:22:53,145
Calm down!

1304
01:22:53,182 --> 01:22:54,170
Stay cool! Ka-kui, calm down.

1305
01:22:54,248 --> 01:22:55,237
Stay back!

1306
01:22:55,283 --> 01:22:55,840
Ka-kui, calm down.

1307
01:22:55,883 --> 01:22:57,249
Let's talk about this.

1308
01:22:58,419 --> 01:22:59,408
Don't come over.

1309
01:23:02,590 --> 01:23:04,080
Don't do that.

1310
01:23:04,292 --> 01:23:05,383
Let's talk.

1311
01:23:06,092 --> 01:23:07,993
We'll sort this out.

1312
01:23:08,195 --> 01:23:09,594
Put your hands on the table.

1313
01:23:11,131 --> 01:23:12,119
Now!

1314
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:14,928
You're being stupid.

1315
01:23:15,301 --> 01:23:17,326
Give up before it's too late!
We'll help you.

1316
01:23:17,703 --> 01:23:18,693
Calm down!

1317
01:23:19,004 --> 01:23:19,993
Trust us!

1318
01:23:20,039 --> 01:23:21,199
We'll sort this out.

1319
01:23:21,574 --> 01:23:22,631
I trust all of you,

1320
01:23:23,275 --> 01:23:24,572
but I can't depend on you.

1321
01:23:24,877 --> 01:23:25,866
You're making it worse!

1322
01:23:25,944 --> 01:23:26,933
Stop!

1323
01:23:27,078 --> 01:23:28,067
Don't move!

1324
01:23:31,983 --> 01:23:32,972
Ka-kui.

1325
01:23:33,017 --> 01:23:34,075
Don't push him!

1326
01:23:36,487 --> 01:23:37,475
Don't push him.

1327
01:23:38,555 --> 01:23:40,785
Call in the snipers. Alert all units.

1328
01:24:00,710 --> 01:24:01,767
Easy, everybody!

1329
01:24:07,148 --> 01:24:08,137
Ka-kui!

1330
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:17,379
Get in!

1331
01:24:20,026 --> 01:24:21,016
Ka-kui!

1332
01:24:21,061 --> 01:24:22,050
Drive out.

1333
01:24:24,797 --> 01:24:25,786
Let them go!

1334
01:24:26,966 --> 01:24:27,955
Don't go after them!

1335
01:24:30,335 --> 01:24:31,324
It's more important to keep Super safe.

1336
01:24:36,408 --> 01:24:37,397
Where are we going?

1337
01:24:41,712 --> 01:24:42,702
Stop.

1338
01:24:45,983 --> 01:24:46,972
Get out.

1339
01:24:54,525 --> 01:24:57,459
I wouldn't have shot

1340
01:24:57,727 --> 01:24:58,717
even if you had run.

1341
01:24:59,229 --> 01:25:00,218
I'm not sure how to help you,

1342
01:25:00,497 --> 01:25:02,589
but you'll have a head start.

1343
01:25:03,967 --> 01:25:05,867
They'll start hunting for you once I get back.

1344
01:25:08,003 --> 01:25:09,164
I'll get Chu Tu

1345
01:25:09,638 --> 01:25:11,196
before your men get me.

1346
01:25:12,374 --> 01:25:14,399
Be careful!

1347
01:25:15,044 --> 01:25:16,033
Thank you, sir.

1348
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:25,318
No one knows where this Salina is.

1349
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:29,947
Let's get a couple of chicks
and have some fun.

1350
01:25:46,205 --> 01:25:48,230
I didn't set you up, Inspector Chan!

1351
01:25:48,374 --> 01:25:49,738
It wasn't me.

1352
01:25:49,974 --> 01:25:51,602
I had no part in it!

1353
01:25:55,948 --> 01:25:56,936
It's for you.

1354
01:26:00,017 --> 01:26:03,851
I'll have it then. I'm starving.

1355
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:01,228
Boss,

1356
01:27:01,273 --> 01:27:03,241
I heard that stupid cop
is on the run.

1357
01:27:03,709 --> 01:27:04,801
Wasn't he arrested?

1358
01:27:05,144 --> 01:27:06,702
He's run away!

1359
01:27:07,578 --> 01:27:09,547
He's got some nerve!

1360
01:27:10,182 --> 01:27:12,775
We should have killed him, too,

1361
01:27:12,950 --> 01:27:13,939
once and for all.

1362
01:27:14,619 --> 01:27:15,608
Where is Salina?

1363
01:27:15,787 --> 01:27:17,652
Mad Wing and Snake Eyes
are looking for her.

1364
01:27:18,222 --> 01:27:20,053
We've heard nothing from them.

1365
01:27:20,458 --> 01:27:22,448
Salina could be with that stupid cop.

1366
01:27:30,366 --> 01:27:31,356
What's up, boss?

1367
01:27:37,239 --> 01:27:38,968
Someone's stealing my data.

1368
01:27:39,208 --> 01:27:40,196
Who is it?

1369
01:27:40,775 --> 01:27:41,765
It must be Salina.

1370
01:27:42,411 --> 01:27:44,002
Only she knows the password.

1371
01:27:44,245 --> 01:27:45,234
Go get her.

1372
01:27:45,513 --> 01:27:46,503
Alert our men.

1373
01:27:46,549 --> 01:27:47,276
Call Mr Cheung.

1374
01:27:47,315 --> 01:27:48,304
Yes.

1375
01:28:03,096 --> 01:28:04,085
How long do we need to wait?

1376
01:28:04,398 --> 01:28:05,386
You're impatient.

1377
01:28:06,899 --> 01:28:07,889
I'm not,

1378
01:28:08,534 --> 01:28:09,728
but I'm scared.

1379
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:23,169
You two stay here.

1380
01:28:37,427 --> 01:28:38,416
Up there.

1381
01:28:41,998 --> 01:28:42,987
What?

1382
01:28:43,166 --> 01:28:44,497
Call Inspector Chou!

1383
01:28:46,803 --> 01:28:48,133
Get that briefcase
or we're doomed!

1384
01:28:48,370 --> 01:28:50,066
Quick!

1385
01:29:29,241 --> 01:29:30,230
That way!

1386
01:29:34,412 --> 01:29:35,504
Ka-kui!

1387
01:29:36,447 --> 01:29:37,506
Why didn't you go to the police?

1388
01:29:37,715 --> 01:29:38,841
Chu Tu's men are here.

1389
01:29:39,317 --> 01:29:40,409
You witnessed Man's murder.

1390
01:29:40,451 --> 01:29:41,439
I'm counting on you.

1391
01:29:41,485 --> 01:29:42,578
I've got evidence on Chu Tu.

1392
01:30:03,004 --> 01:30:03,994
They're here!

1393
01:30:27,361 --> 01:30:29,089
Take her back to the office. Quick!

1394
01:30:32,899 --> 01:30:33,957
What's going on?

1395
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:35,389
Not your business.

1396
01:30:43,709 --> 01:30:44,698
Let's go.

1397
01:31:12,135 --> 01:31:13,124
Beat him.

1398
01:33:08,141 --> 01:33:09,573
Off.

1399
01:33:11,577 --> 01:33:12,565
Come on!

1400
01:33:12,610 --> 01:33:13,600
I'm not going.

1401
01:33:18,751 --> 01:33:19,739
Kill him!

1402
01:34:35,719 --> 01:34:36,879
Catch!

1403
01:34:38,956 --> 01:34:40,389
It's there! Go and get it!

1404
01:34:44,061 --> 01:34:45,050
May!

1405
01:34:45,328 --> 01:34:46,317
Are you all right, Ka-kui?

1406
01:34:46,462 --> 01:34:47,896
Don't worry about me.
Get the briefcase!

1407
01:34:48,965 --> 01:34:49,954
OK.

1408
01:34:52,601 --> 01:34:53,591
Go to hell!

1409
01:35:02,211 --> 01:35:03,303
Chu Tu!

1410
01:35:09,785 --> 01:35:10,773
Quick!

1411
01:35:19,293 --> 01:35:20,282
Hurry!

1412
01:35:47,252 --> 01:35:48,241
Ka-kui, stop!

1413
01:35:48,286 --> 01:35:49,184
Don't do it!

1414
01:35:49,220 --> 01:35:50,208
Calm down!

1415
01:35:54,758 --> 01:35:55,747
Put that down.

1416
01:35:55,792 --> 01:35:56,781
We'll sort this out!

1417
01:35:56,927 --> 01:35:57,916
Ka-kui!

1418
01:35:57,961 --> 01:35:58,950
This is between him and me.

1419
01:35:59,329 --> 01:36:01,193
He's not worth it.

1420
01:36:01,398 --> 01:36:03,831
There's no justice. I have to take
the law into my own hands.

1421
01:36:04,033 --> 01:36:05,022
I'm helping the weak ones.

1422
01:36:05,067 --> 01:36:07,002
Don't do anything foolish.

1423
01:36:07,137 --> 01:36:09,001
I'm going to kill him right here.

1424
01:36:09,205 --> 01:36:10,729
It was Danny Chu who killed Inspector Man.

1425
01:36:12,742 --> 01:36:15,141
All the evidence is in the briefcase.

1426
01:36:20,749 --> 01:36:21,737
Are you all right?

1427
01:36:21,782 --> 01:36:23,774
May is hurt, Ka-kui.
Take care of her first!

1428
01:36:31,825 --> 01:36:33,816
Take all the suspects
back to the station!

1429
01:36:34,361 --> 01:36:35,555
You're abusing your power
as police officers.

1430
01:36:35,796 --> 01:36:37,319
You're hurting innocent people.

1431
01:36:37,563 --> 01:36:38,758
You're not above the law.
Justice is for everyone.

1432
01:36:40,934 --> 01:36:43,698
I'm going to sue you for kidnapping,
threatening and assaulting my client.

1433
01:36:44,103 --> 01:36:45,161
I'm not going to let you

1434
01:36:45,405 --> 01:36:46,769
get away with this!

1435
01:36:47,172 --> 01:36:48,800
You threaten,

1436
01:36:49,208 --> 01:36:51,038
beat up good citizen.

1437
01:36:51,610 --> 01:36:52,599
I'll sue you..

1438
01:36:52,678 --> 01:36:54,168
You lot are a menace to society!

1439
01:36:59,284 --> 01:37:00,273
He just proved it.

1440
01:37:00,352 --> 01:37:01,443
Ka-kui, let go of him.

1441
01:37:01,686 --> 01:37:02,675
This is entrapment!

1442
01:37:02,787 --> 01:37:04,345
You're going to jail.

1443
01:37:04,555 --> 01:37:06,022
How dare you treat a lawyer like that?

1444
01:37:06,924 --> 01:37:08,356
We're so glad you're here, Mr Cheung!

1445
01:37:13,229 --> 01:37:14,218
You...

1446
01:37:30,178 --> 01:37:31,373
You'll have to help me with that report.

1447
01:37:32,514 --> 01:37:33,502
Pardon?

1448
01:37:34,048 --> 01:37:35,037
Let's write it together.

1449
01:37:35,583 --> 01:37:37,073
I didn't see anything.

1450
01:37:49,162 --> 01:37:51,493
That's enough!
