2
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,550
Man's voice:
So, I'm dead...

3
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,850
and I think it's because
of this redhead.

4
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,230
Do you know who I am, Jake?

5
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,400
The Antichrist?

6
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,070
I'm just a guy
looking for some answers.

7
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,730
Hey, you know, pal,
ain't we all?

8
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,740
Things are probably gonna
end bad for you tonight, Jake.

9
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,990
Yeah, I'm starting
to get that feeling.

10
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,960
Is your life flashing
before your eyes?

11
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,750
Honestly?
Just the last three weeks.

12
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,590
It's not a bad place to start.

13
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,760
Calm down, okay? I'm sorry.

14
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,800
I lost my head in there,
I don't know what happened.

15
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,840
You fucking shot him,
that's what happened.

16
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,010
What other fucking choice do I have?
The motherfucker was gonna welch.

17
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,060
Did you not hear him?
Did you not see him?

18
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,770
I can't be here, man,
do you understand me?

19
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,310
- I can't fucking be here!
- Listen to me, all right?

20
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,310
It went to shit,
that happens sometimes.

21
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,320
- Oh, fuck, man!
- You're not listening, Lionel.

22
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,360
We can still get through this,
we still have some time,

23
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,110
but I need you
to use your fucking head,

24
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,160
and I need you to trust me.

25
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,200
Can you do that?

26
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,660
- (police sirens blare)
- Let's go!

27
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,800
Jake:
Come on, let's hustle it up.

28
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,140
Come on,
grab his feet, will you?

29
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,520
Lionel, he's dead, all right?
Maybe you didn't pull the trigger,

30
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,110
but you were standing right there
and you saw me do it.

31
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,280
Now grab his fucking legs.

32
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,990
Bartender:
Tick-tock.

33
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,490
Hey, you wanna help, then help.
If not, shut your piehole.

34
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,530
Your mess!

35
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,530
Jake: Do me a favor, please,
shut your fucking mouth.

36
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,080
My place.

37
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,040
Maybe now,
you'll shut the fuck up.

38
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,580
Please!

39
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,290
You think this kind of shit
hasn't happened here before?

40
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,170
Given, it's usually on Wednesday and
usually I tell the cops,

41
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:54,010
"No, officer, I didn't get
a good look at the shooters."

42
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,680
Usually, anyway...

43
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,810
I swear to God,
I didn't see anything.

44
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,270
You let me go,
I won't say a word, I promise.

45
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,770
Don't get hysterical on us, sweetheart, all
right?

46
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,520
I can't fucking be here!

47
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,980
Then you know what, Lionel,
maybe you should go.

48
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,990
What about the money?

49
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,950
What about this situation
makes you think

50
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,330
I can answer that question,
right now?

51
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,670
Fuck! Fuck!

52
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,130
(screams)

53
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,170
(police sirens blare)

54
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,770
Cop #1:
Freeze!

55
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,940
Freeze, you motherfucking
cocksucking scumbags!

56
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,650
All right, guys,
stop waving those things...

57
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,820
What took you so fucking long?
Jesus Christ!

58
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,450
It's like 100 degrees in here
and I'm lying in this shit forever.

59
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,950
What the fuck! You guys were late,
we had to go to a Mexican stand-off.

60
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,580
We had to go to gunplay.
Gentlemen, that isn't our racket.

61
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,830
We were busy fighting crime.

62
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,000
You're keeping the streets safe
from pedophiles and drug dealers?

63
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,630
Oh! Goddamn it.

64
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,840
I told you, you're using too much powder,
look at my fucking shirt.

65
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,090
I understand,
but you know something?

66
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,920
You don't get
the nice splatter effect.

67
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,220
Look at this splatter effect.

68
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,090
The ones with blood
come out of your cut.

69
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,760
- I can live with that.
- Hey, Jake,

70
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,970
when do I get
to play the inside?

71
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,640
Gordo plays the inside.
You are the shill, you know that.

72
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,390
Yeah, but come on, all I do
is cry and get insulted here.

73
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,770
What are you talking about?

74
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,110
You should get a fucking Academy Award
for the shill work you do.

75
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,280
Jake: Big Al, does anyone
do it better than you?

76
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,110
Come on, we've got
a good thing going here.

77
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,070
You want to jinx us
by changing things?

78
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,620
Yeah, you're right,
I don't want to jinx anything.

79
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,120
Of course I'm right.
Here you go, that's your cut.

80
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,450
- Thank you.
- Good work, paisan.

81
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,130
- What?
- It's a lot of cash.

82
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,670
He came up with it
awfully quick.

83
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,710
Did you see how quickly
he got out of here?

84
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,840
- He's not coming back, it's over.
- Okay, fine.

85
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,430
I've gotta pinch a loaf.
Did anybody mess up the hoop?

86
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,970
- It's clean.
- Gentlemen,

87
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,310
10%, your cut. Enjoy!

88
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,440
You guys got a lot of sack, man.
I'll give you that much.

89
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,400
It's confidence.
Just confidence.

90
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,440
It doesn't matter what the con is.

91
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,740
Insider trading,
a line we got at a bookie club,

92
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,780
insurance scam, whatever.

93
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,790
You've seen the money
and you want it. More of it.

94
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,370
So who cares if you have
to bend the rules a little bit?

95
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,120
As long as nobody gets hurt.

96
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,170
But then somebody does.

97
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,000
- (gunshot)
- (scream)

98
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,890
Tommy Suits always said,
"A confidence game

99
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,010
is like putting on a play,
where everyone knows their part.

100
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,180
The inside man, the roper,
the shills,

101
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,270
everyone, that is,
except for the mark."

102
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,900
So now you're
an accomplice in a homicide.

103
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,020
Everything you thought
you were in control of,

104
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,070
just flew out the window,
or is dripping down your leg.

105
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,150
You should be running out the door,

106
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,530
desperate to forget
that this ever happened,

107
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,620
and ready to repent
your greedy ways.

108
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,240
What about the money?

109
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,830
Jake:
Then there it is again, that itch.

110
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,670
There's a guy standing in front
of you with a smoking gun,

111
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,290
another guy on the floor
bleeding all over the place,

112
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,750
and all you can do
is think about the money.

113
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,010
You're a sick twisted fuck.

114
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,380
So we gotta make sure
we give you the blow off.

115
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,140
We have to make sure that you never
ever come looking for us again.

116
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,680
We have to get you off
of our backs, forever.

117
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,560
(police sirens blare)

118
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,730
That's why
we give you the fix.

119
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,110
Fuck.

120
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,400
Fuck! Fuck!

121
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,440
Fuck!

122
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,570
LAPD's finest.

123
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,610
Half as smart
and twice as crooked

124
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,740
- as the guy they just chased away.
- Freeze! Motherfucking scumbags...

125
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,160
Sucking-fucking cocksuckers!

126
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,040
Man:
Grifters.

127
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,250
We all can't be
model citizens such as yourself.

128
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,880
- It's all about the money, isn't it?
- Ain't it always?

129
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,550
Jake:
That's what makes us run.

130
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,210
- What's your name?
- Dutch.

131
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,760
- And despite what they say...
- I love that name.

132
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,300
- Me too.
- It can buy you love.

133
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,350
Check it out,
original leather seats,

134
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,680
soft top, and you're gonna
love this, suicide doors.

135
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,940
- Nice!

136
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,440
Jake:
It can say everything about you.

137
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,770
It can erase all those things
about you, you wish didn't exist.

138
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,190
It's Alphonse. I wanna settle up.

139
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,280
No, I haven't been ducking you.

140
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,820
I told you, I get it.

141
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,990
Jake: It can make you think
you're on top of the world.

142
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,410
And if you believe that money
can do all that for you,

143
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,580
you are the perfect mark.

144
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,130
Oops!

145
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,720
Wasn't it Jack Kerouac who said,

146
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,680
"If you own a rug,
you own too much."

147
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,060
I don't necessarily like Kerouac,

148
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,110
and driving cross-country
isn't my idea of a good time,

149
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,150
but the guy's got a point.

150
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,690
(answering machine)
...three messages.

151
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,030
Hey, it's Monica, Bill. I'm still
dizzy from the other night. Call me.

152
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,370
Hi Scott, Just thought I'd call you
and tell you I'm back.

153
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,200
You know the number,
it's Kate, by the way.

154
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,290
Bruce, it's Cheryl, if you don't want to see
me, just say so.

155
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,330
But this is the last time
I'm calling.

156
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,380
Jake: If you've got nothing,
you've got nothing to lose.

157
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,670
But when it comes to money, whether it's
finding it or losing it,

158
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,010
you just have to remember
how much of it is just luck.

159
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,140
Oops!

160
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,060
Jake:
Just dumb fucking luck.

161
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,240
(door slams open)

162
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,080
Mr. Dolby?

163
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,330
Mr. King would like a word with you.

164
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:59,210
- Now? Right now?
- We have a car waiting.

165
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,220
(phone ringing)

166
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,680
- Hello.
- You better get over to Al's now.

167
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,560
- For what?
- (dial tone)

168
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,600
Hello?

169
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,650
Nothing.
Who the fuck?!

170
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,740
There's a couple hundred bucks on
his dresser. All of his shit's here.

171
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,580
This definitely wasn't
a random thing.

172
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,540
Is it ever a random thing?

173
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,170
Shit, Al.
What did you do?

174
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,250
- Let's just think about this...
- Gordo: This fucking town, man.

175
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,880
Jesus Christ,
I had a bad feeling about LA.

176
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,800
Didn't I say that?
This damn fucking town!

177
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,970
Gordo, now is not
the time for that, all right?

178
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,720
I'm sorry,
I'm just a little...

179
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,060
Jesus Christ. Look at
what they did to him, Jake.

180
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,520
Right in the middle
of his egg foo yung.

181
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,270
Think they know about us?
What if they get to us too?

182
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,440
Don't start
freaking out, okay?

183
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,780
Let's get Al out of here first.
Miles, get a blanket or something.

184
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,620
No, we're going to
leave him right here.

185
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,660
What are you, high?

186
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,290
We're not leaving Al here.

187
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,710
Gordo: Grab that end, now.
Grab it, Miles!

188
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,170
Jake: Miles, pick up the table
and put it back.

189
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,090
Gordo, let go of the fucking rug.
I said we're leaving him here.

190
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,550
Drop it.

191
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,850
Fuck you! How long have we
worked with this fucking guy?

192
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,980
I'm not going to just fucking
leave him here! All right?

193
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,480
Gordo,
get a fucking grip.

194
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,320
We're leaving him here.

195
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,890
Jake: Big Al used to send
money to his father,

196
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,430
a Vietnam vet slowly losing his mind in a VA
hospital in Cleveland.

197
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,110
- Al was like that.
- Now you coming?

198
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,950
Jake: That's why Al never
played the inside.

199
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,370
There he is.
So what do you hear?

200
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,790
Well, Lionel Dolby came down with a
sudden case of drowning last night.

201
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,460
They just pulled him out
of the Silverlake reservoir.

202
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,710
Now I know why he
was such a good rope.

203
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,760
I mean, cash, that much, and we never had
to put him on the send?

204
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,550
Turns out this fucking mope
is an accountant for the King.

205
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,220
The what? Who's that?

206
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,350
The cash we fleeced off him
was collection money.

207
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,850
Bookies, pushers,
you know, whatever.

208
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,100
He was supposed to take that
money and give it back to the King

209
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,900
earlier yesterday,
like he does every Thursday,

210
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,190
except this time that fucking stenad figured
he could make

211
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,070
a little something off of us and still get the
money back to King

212
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,160
before anybody says, "Boo."

213
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,830
- Okay, what's a king?
- Currently?

214
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,910
A very large-type pole stuck
right up our asses, Miles.

215
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,370
- Mob?
- No.

216
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,330
No. Independent.

217
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,090
Winston King.

218
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,130
He likes to call
himself "The King."

219
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,010
How'd they get to Al?

220
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,090
It's beautiful.

221
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,930
Last night Al calls some
bookie out in Redondo,

222
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,600
tells them he's got
the cash to settle up.

223
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:47,100
Because, apparently he's been ducking this
guy for like a month.

224
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,270
Classic fucking Al, right?

225
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,520
So the bookie asks where he's
got this money, all of a sudden.

226
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,070
Does Al tell this guy that he just cashed a
fucking bar mitzvah bond?

227
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,950
That he's been giving head
for 20 bucks a pop? No.

228
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,740
No.

229
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,910
The fucking idiot starts
going on and on about how

230
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,420
this job he just pulled,
how he fleeced Dolby...

231
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,790
how he fleeced...

232
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,090
- You pissed we didn't get credit?
- No, no, no.

233
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,880
That was the only semi-fucking
smart thing he said.

234
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,880
Except, anybody that's
ever met Big Al

235
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,180
knows the only thing he's comfortable
doing alone

236
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,220
is eating.

237
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,600
So this guy tells that guy,
that guy tells some other guy,

238
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,980
eventually it gets back to someone who
works for the King and...

239
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,940
Shazaam.

240
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,990
Any idea who
the shooter was?

241
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,740
Specifically?
I don't know.

242
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:42,490
But, I'm sure they're
looking for us, too.

243
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,830
All right, just an idea, let's divvy up the
cash and split.

244
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,750
Excuse me. Are you new?
Is that the thing? Is he new?

245
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,960
Miles, this guy holds a grudge better than
my ex-mother-in-law.

246
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:56,670
You remember that Moshe Macelli? That
Jew-Italian guy from Boston?

247
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,630
They used to call him Matzo Mazzarelli?
Remember that?

248
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,590
The guy with the face spaz?

249
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,800
It's called a facial twitch, Miles.

250
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,270
And the guy was not
born like that, you know.

251
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:11,350
Five years ago, Matzo was turf-fixing for
the King at Santa Anita,

252
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,690
and he skimmed two grand
before skipping town.

253
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,820
Five years later King
finally catches up to him,

254
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,530
keeps him chained in his fucking bathroom
for like five days.

255
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,990
Oh, God.

256
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,830
Now just say the word King,
and he spits up all over himself.

257
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,500
- Jesus!
- Pathetic.

258
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,960
Even words like Vi-king and
shrin-king, they set the guy off.

259
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,500
That's a five-year grudge
over $2000.

260
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,880
So we go talk to him.

261
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,420
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
You wanna give the money back?

262
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,510
- I didn't say that.
- Pittsburgh.

263
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,550
Madrone.

264
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,390
Pittsburgh is where
it's happening.

265
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,730
Bird flew into my
house last night, too.

266
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,110
Not a good sign, Gordo.

267
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,660
Jake:
The Euclid was our place.

268
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,870
Gordo fleeced the deed off
some jack-off in a card game.

269
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,870
We used it every now and then for
a rag, but mostly it was our office.

270
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,960
Our power point.

271
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,250
What are you doing?

272
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,210
Where the hell's that going?

273
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,110
- We want insurance?
- Jesus Christ, Miles.

274
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,110
I'm just asking.

275
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,030
Just mail it.

276
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,290
Yeah, I'm looking
for the King, please.

277
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,450
Just tell him it's regarding
an accounting problem.

278
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,460
Yeah, he'll know.

279
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,710
Hollywood and Vine?
Okay.

280
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,090
- When?
- Two hours from now.

281
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,140
- But just me.
- Fuck that. We're going too.

282
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:09,680
Let's all just put our dicks back in our
pants for a second, okay?

283
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,480
Is this the best
thing to do, Jake?

284
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,270
How do you know the King
is going to let you walk, Jake?

285
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,480
'Cause I'm getting a ride.

286
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,700
Don't be dicking around
in there, okay?

287
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:28,450
And if he shoots you or stabs you or
causes you to bleed profusely,

288
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,080
call a cab, 'cause your ass
ain't getting back in here.

289
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,660
Thanks, guys.

290
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,000
We appreciate your punctuality.
Mr. King is expecting you.

291
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,380
Lupus!

292
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,510
You said to pat him down,
so I'm patting him down.

293
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,090
It only takes a
moment to be polite.

294
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,340
My apology, Mr. Vig.
If you wouldn't mind?

295
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,310
- So you the guy that got Big Al?
- Nope.

296
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,520
Mr. King farms out
that kind of work. Please.

297
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,190
After you.

298
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,330
Wait with the ladies.

299
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,870
Harlin.

300
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,460
Okay, now you see
that right there?

301
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:24,420
Find out who she is. Make a note.
I think it's channel 42 or 3.

302
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:27,800
- A little harder.
- The girls are here and the kid.

303
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,800
Also got the Seldin brothers
with a shipment.

304
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,050
- Bring them in.
- Which?

305
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,390
- Whatever.
- The brothers, the girl or the kid?

306
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,640
Oh that's good. Whoever. Come on. I'm
getting a massage, Harlin.

307
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,270
You got it, boss.

308
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,230
Jake, ladies.

309
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,570
Harlin, I think I bet that dog.

310
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,070
Go! Go! Go!

311
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,320
Hey.

312
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,530
Well, look it here.

313
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,080
- Hi, girls.
- Girls: Hi.

314
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,080
So, are you two together?

315
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,830
We're sisters.

316
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,040
I like sisters!

317
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,750
Jake, I can't quite see.
Why don't you move a little bit,

318
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,800
so that I can check them out
then you can check them out?

319
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,510
Thanks.

320
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,760
- Sisters, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

321
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,050
- And you're over 18?
- Yeah.

322
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,890
Harlin, let's see
what the sisters can do.

323
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,270
- Put them in the booth.
- Ladies.

324
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,770
Harlin: Oh, by the way,
he had an escort.

325
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,860
LAPD.

326
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,240
That's a little overreacting,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

327
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,950
It's just a little insurance,
that's all.

328
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,120
Uh-huh.
So, they're on the take for you.

329
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:37,910
Shh. You must be pretty good if
you got cops driving you around.

330
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,080
Is that because
you look so innocent,

331
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,120
and you're kind of cute there
aren't you?

332
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,380
Yeah, it's something like that.

333
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,420
So what do you do, tiger?

334
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,420
You just con people
out of their money?

335
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,090
There is actually
some technique to it.

336
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,100
You mean, like... style.

337
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,480
Yeah, it helps,
don't you think?

338
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,140
No, style is at the end of my list,
I'll tell you why,

339
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,190
when I was a young man like you
just starting out,

340
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,150
my first big score,
this guy we robbed.

341
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,110
I think his name was...
Chinatown Schmidt!

342
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,900
It was nothing big,
my end was about $800.

343
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,660
The first thing I did, I go out
and get myself a suit, right?

344
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,700
Yeah, I looked good.
It was like white.

345
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,950
It was white.
It was white white.

346
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,750
White, white, white, white, white!

347
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,790
Oh, I looked good, man.

348
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,340
I walked down the street,
everybody was checking me out.

349
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:30,630
- Male and female.
- I'm sure they did.

350
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,720
Anyway, the first day I wore it out,

351
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,140
October, it was still hot out.

352
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,390
We were kicking back in Malibu
and Chinatown Schmidt, right?

353
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,140
He catches up with us, so two guys
roll by and boom, boom, boom, boom!

354
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,190
Boom, boom, boom, boom!

355
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,150
Six of us, scatter, man.
The dust settles.

356
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,190
Everybody's checking
their fingers and their toes.

357
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,730
And who is the one guy
that got hit, sailor?

358
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,490
You know why?

359
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,530
White suit!

360
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:00,950
I was the first thing they saw,
I was the first thing they aimed at.

361
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,000
I was the first thing they hit.

362
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,620
So what did I learn
that day, Jake?

363
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,670
Don't wear white
after Labor Day, maybe?

364
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,510
No. Sometimes, Jake,

365
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,130
style can get you killed.

366
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,350
Harlin: Mr. King,
the girls are ready!

367
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,480
Oh great! Wait, sport,
you're gonna love this.

368
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,730
- You ever been here before?
- No, it's not really my thing.

369
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,770
Oh, you don't know that.
Tuesday we got Disco Night,

370
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,780
Wednesday is that
electronic music shit,

371
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,240
Thursdays are
Gay and Lesbian Night.

372
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,780
That is very tasteful, by the way.
Ow! Ow! Ow!

373
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,070
Lupus, I want you
to get me... Lupus!

374
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,830
Goddamn it, you're looking at them
or you're working for me?

375
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,580
I want you to get me an espresso,
please, and tell that bitch

376
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,750
to give me back my slippy dips.
Come on. Now!

377
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,880
Let me ask you something,
why one of my guys?

378
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,590
Why Lionel Dolby?

379
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,130
My six-year-old nephew could con
anything out of that dude. Why?

380
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,430
Look, if we knew Dolby
was connected to you,

381
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,600
we'd never have gone near him, so
I apologize for any inconvenience.

382
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,010
Honest mistake,
all right?

383
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:05,270
It's just something between two guys
that don't know each other yet.

384
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,440
So we're gonna make
an exchange of the money

385
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,770
and all will be forgiven.
Isn't that right?

386
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,360
- No. That I won't do.
- Won't?

387
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:16,950
You won't.
You won't.

388
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,740
I want you to look very hard at me,
motherfucker, and tell me why.

389
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,370
Let me rephrase that.
That I can't do.

390
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,750
Because A, I don't have the money,
and B, you killed one of my guys.

391
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,040
One of your guys.
That's four-spot, right?

392
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,090
- Yeah.
- Four.

393
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,380
One of your guys, huh?

394
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,550
I gotta take a pill,
or I'm all over the place.

395
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,720
- This is confidential, right?
- Yeah.

396
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,220
Mm! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

397
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,770
Hey, stop it!
Stop that right now!

398
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,600
They can't hear me. Harlin,
get them outta there, Goddamn it.

399
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,440
Down! Down! Shit, man.

400
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,480
How do you like that?
They're sisters.

401
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,070
Let me ask you something.
I want a straight answer now.

402
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,070
You did not know
that Dolby was connected to me?

403
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,580
- You heard me before.
- But it's so important

404
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,620
that you don't stray from the truth
in this one little part.

405
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,080
I didn't know.

406
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,670
You're a good grifter, man.

407
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,500
It's hard to tell when you're lying.

408
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:19,510
But I'm getting there.
Come here, girls.

409
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:23,140
Now listen, it's the first time
I've ever put girls in the booth.

410
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,850
Usually, they work their way up.

411
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,520
You're gonna go work on your routine,
you know why?

412
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,560
Because you're saying
that you are sisters.

413
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,270
- Mm-mm, We are sisters.
- Shh.

414
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,310
- We're very close.
- Let me talk. Let me talk.

415
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,980
- You don't like what we're doing?
- Of course I like what you're doing

416
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,690
but I like it done
with artistry, with grace,

417
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,860
and that means,
if you're gonna eat each other,

418
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,370
you must find a way
to do it tastefully, okay?

419
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,040
These are people here,
they've got families, all right?

420
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,620
- Okay.
- You understand? Then go work!

421
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,420
- Go on. Go on!
- Ladies.

422
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,380
Tell me this,

423
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,420
how are you and I
gonna resolve our shit?

424
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,630
I get you what I owe you,

425
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,380
plus interest,
by going on the grift for you.

426
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,100
I like that. Okay, sit down.
Put your baby cakes down here,

427
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:07,180
that cute little
Irish muscle ass you got.

428
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,810
Look, I came here
to do a deal,

429
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,850
not play grab-ass with you,
you freak, all right?

430
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,270
- Humor.
- You heard my proposal

431
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,820
- Humor, Jake, junior,
buster, humor. Come on.

432
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,860
You wanna get out of here
I gotta open up the place.

433
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,660
Come on, sit down.
Business. Come on.

434
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,580
All right. Here's what l...

435
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,870
- you don't want to sit closer?
- No, I'm fine over here, thank you.

436
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,080
All right.

437
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,090
Can I see your hand?

438
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,630
You got a big hand. Let me see
your hand, I'm not gonna bite you.

439
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,010
Look at that hand, man.
You should have been a pianist,

440
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,050
or a guitarist,
look at the size of that.

441
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,430
Wow. See this?

442
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,430
That's your love line.
That's your money line.

443
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,270
And that's looking very very good.

444
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,730
And that's your life line,
going all the way down...

445
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,860
Uh-oh.

446
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,900
You see that little gap there.

447
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:03,150
It means that at one point
you could have a little trouble.

448
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,410
But it's up to you
to make it better.

449
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:11,830
I want you to talk to me
and I want you to make me happy.

450
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,040
And I don't want you to scare me.

451
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,290
You do not want to scare me, junior.

452
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,460
What's gonna happen, now?

453
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,970
I play a con.
You get a cut, I get a cut.

454
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,430
We get square.

455
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:31,060
And I give you the who
and you give me the how, right?

456
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,230
And you can
because you're so good, right?

457
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,940
I like to think so.

458
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:37,650
Okay, you're gonna do this
with Morgan Price.

459
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,320
- Morgan Price?
- Yes.

460
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,400
- Impossible.
- Why?

461
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,450
'Cause you can't get to him.
He's too big.

462
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,650
You got to me.

463
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,990
- Yeah, but we got to you because...
- What?

464
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,080
- You were a fluke, a mistake.

465
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,620
That's a good answer.

466
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,710
- Why Morgan Price?
- 'Cause he's very important to me.

467
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,920
Lupus!

468
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:02,880
Don't fuck with me, junior,
okay? Lupus!

469
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,170
You know what?

470
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,470
You're gonna take
my friend Lupus with you, okay?

471
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,010
Absolutely not,
that's not the way I operate.

472
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,970
- Shh.
- I work with my guys.

473
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,020
You're gonna take Lupus with you.

474
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,060
That's the way I operate.

475
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:22,020
Look at me, now.
Tell me we're set.

476
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,820
- Yeah. We're set.
- Good.

477
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,200
We're done
with all this business now?

478
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,990
The rest of it
depends on you.

479
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,750
I think I'm done.

480
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,220
* Erotica *

481
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,260
* Romance *

482
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,640
* Erotica *

483
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,690
* Romance *

484
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,900
* My name is Dita *

485
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,940
* I'll be your mistress tonight *

486
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,410
* I'd like to put you
in a trance... *

487
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,450
Excuse me, miss? Miss!

488
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,500
I think you dropped something.

489
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,710
You know you're good,
but you're not that good.

490
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,750
I spotted that lift
from across the club.

491
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,970
Wait?
You don't recognize me?

492
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,640
- Tony, could you get my car?
- Sure!

493
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:34,050
You really don't remember me,
do you?

494
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,430
Should I?

495
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,940
Oh, right.

496
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,150
That's good.

497
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,900
So, you're interested
in a little work?

498
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,110
You couldn't afford me.

499
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,570
Not with $27

500
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:54,120
and a maxed-out Visa, John.

501
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,490
Or is it Tom or Bill?

502
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,540
Hard to tell
with so many IDs.

503
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,660
Yeah, well, the name's Jake.

504
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,960
And don't flatter yourself, sweetheart.

505
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:05,040
That's one thing
I never had to pay for,

506
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,130
and I don't consider it work.

507
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,800
Guess you got
the wrong girl then.

508
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:14,970
Do me a favor,
take a deep breath and count to 10.

509
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,350
I'm talking about a grift,
and it pays well.

510
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,430
Unless you think
you're gonna get rich

511
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,480
jerking off geriatrics
in that place.

512
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,520
I didn't know you cared.

513
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,940
Keep the wallet.

514
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,990
We're even.

515
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,110
Take a deep breath,

516
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,280
count to 10, and...

517
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,120
go fuck yourself!

518
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,880
Look, it pays well.

519
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,090
Six figures.

520
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,170
All you gotta do
is play a part,

521
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,840
do a little acting.

522
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,930
You think
you can handle that?

523
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,560
Why me?
You don't even know me.

524
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:00,390
'Cause what I've seen, I liked.

525
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,600
And I got
a good feeling about you.

526
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:07,310
Hasn't anyone ever
said that to you before?

527
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,950
No.

528
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,240
- Thanks, Tony.
- You bet!

529
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,370
But, I'll think about it.

530
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,740
All right, I think
it will be worth your while.

531
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,040
Make a wish.

532
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:26,330
11:11, make a wish.

533
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,210
That's twice!

534
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,470
- I can see why you liked her.
- Yeah, I liked her a lot.

535
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,890
And that was it, we had our crew.

536
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,730
Now all we needed was the con.

537
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,060
Miles:
Bottoms. Oh...

538
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:49,520
- Oh well.
- Shit!

539
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,860
What's up, guys?

540
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,150
Who's the mope?

541
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,200
This is Lupus.

542
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,740
He works with the King and now
he's gonna be part of our crew.

543
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,080
I'm here to make sure
things go smoothly.

544
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:03,000
Woman:
Anybody got a light?

545
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,750
And this is Lily.

546
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,880
She's the new shill
I was telling you about.

547
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,170
- Whoa.
- Gordo: Whoa, whoa, whoa...

548
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,510
Hold the fucking phone,
what is this?

549
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,680
Are we playing a con, or are we doing a
rendition of "Our Town"?

550
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:22,430
Gordo, trust me.
We need the help on this one.

551
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,430
Our new mark?
Morgan Price.

552
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:29,940
Why?

553
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,280
Because, that's who the King
wants us to fleece.

554
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,740
And besides,
the price is perfect.

555
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,450
I'm not supposed to wait for you,
you're supposed to wait for me.

556
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,620
Jake: His old man
was a big time mob attorney.

557
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,870
Which makes him
a second generation crook.

558
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:50,080
When he dropped dead, Price
carried on the family tradition,

559
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,460
by opening a one-stop shopping center for
money laundering

560
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,670
and low interest corporate fraud.

561
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,760
Well, fuck him!

562
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,840
Almost $1 billion gets washed
through his shop every year,

563
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,430
so we know
he's got the money.

564
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,310
It's just a matter
of getting to it.

565
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,850
How much
are we going after?

566
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,270
$5 million.

567
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,440
- We can only hold the King at 150.
- I know.

568
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,450
That's why we don't go
after him directly.

569
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,070
First, we find a doable mark
in Price's bank,

570
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,120
a mid-level employee.

571
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:27,330
We meet him with papers,
inquiring about a corporate loan.

572
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,120
Our guy then fudges numbers
in the right places.

573
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,210
Moves our papers to the top
of the pile or to the bottom,

574
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,670
depending upon what we need.

575
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,550
Our loan is approved.

576
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,340
On the given day,

577
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,800
the money's wired into a corporate
account in an offshore bank.

578
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,760
That same day, I show up
in Belize with the proper ID,

579
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,310
and corporate papers
to make the withdrawal.

580
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,900
- Um-mm.
- What? What is it, Miles?

581
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,900
I'm just thinking
out loud here...

582
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,480
but $5 million
in a briefcase?

583
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,530
Good point.

584
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,950
Jake: It's bank policy not
to release this money in cash,

585
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,200
'cause it's under
a corporate account.

586
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,120
So we then cash the check
at another bank.

587
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,880
Any major airport's
gonna be too hard to control.

588
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:17,920
LAX is out.
So we use Ontario.

589
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,380
Mid-level hub
with direct international flights.

590
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,720
40 minutes outside LA.
This is the most important part,

591
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:26,390
you can't just walk
into the United States

592
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,810
with a suitcase full of cash,

593
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,730
without evoking the words
"cavity search."

594
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,480
That's why we need someone
on the inside at Customs.

595
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:42,740
Then we disappear.

596
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:51,410
Now this might just be me,
but that is hands down

597
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,670
the dumbest fucking idea
I've ever heard.

598
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,920
Gordo:
People have tried this before, Jake.

599
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,550
It's never worked.

600
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,590
Teddy Fraiser and his crew
got nailed in Vancouver last year.

601
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,680
It's never worked before,

602
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,550
because, A,
they didn't flush the bank enough,

603
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,850
B, their corporate papers
were for shit,

604
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,600
and C, unlike us,

605
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,720
they did not have somebody
on the inside at Customs.

606
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,100
Yeah, or D,
it's a dumb fucking idea!

607
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,350
Hey!

608
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:19,900
What do you fucking suggest,
Miles? You wanna run?

609
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,780
We never had
a problem with that, before.

610
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,200
Jake: We never had
a fucking problem like this before.

611
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,870
Yes, we have, okay?

612
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,530
And we would have been
beautiful about it.

613
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,580
We would have had
a bucket of fried chicken,

614
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,080
delivered to the King with a nice

615
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,290
Kiss My Ass card attached to it,
and we would have moved on

616
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,750
until the next
local putz caught on.

617
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,710
We're getting
too old to run, Miles.

618
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:43,720
Yeah well, we're still
a little too young for San Quentin.

619
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:50,470
Look, I'm... I mean,
are you pissed off about Al?

620
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,560
Look at me.

621
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,810
Trust me, I'm pissed too.

622
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,560
But I'm not 25-to-life pissed.

623
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,900
Look, I'm getting clear of this.

624
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,990
All right?

625
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,280
So if you don't want to do it
for the fucking principle,

626
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,750
do it for the money.
Gordo?

627
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,630
Yeah, Jake, whatever.

628
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,500
There's no whatever with this one.

629
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,050
You're either with me
or against me.

630
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,050
No third position.

631
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,840
I'm in.

632
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,350
Aw, what a relief.

633
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,810
Oh, fuck.

634
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,850
Jake:
I agreed with Miles,

635
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,860
it was hands down,
a dumb fucking idea.

636
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:42,530
But they bought in,
now I had to deliver...

637
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,070
- Yeah, it's Vig.
- And I needed help.

638
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,570
Cop #1: What are we gonna do
with this stuff? I mean, heroin.

639
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,860
- What do you do with heroin?
- You sell it.

640
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,490
- To who?
- Don't be a knucklehead.

641
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:54,160
Cop #2: How hard do you think it is
to sell one drug dealer's drugs

642
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,200
to another drug dealer?

643
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,870
If Vig is right,
we're looking at 100, 150.

644
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:01,630
You think it's a good idea?
We never done this shit before.

645
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:05,170
Well, what is he gonna do,
file a missing drug report?

646
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,380
Hey if it works out, we could turn the guy
over a few times.

647
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,300
I hope so, bro'. I took my daughter
to the orthodontist, yesterday.

648
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,350
150 bucks to tighten
those bitches up.

649
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,390
Took him five minutes.
Then he said it wasn't even covered.

650
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,560
It's cosmetic.
The plan doesn't cover cosmetic.

651
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,480
I had a cap put in here, right?

652
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,820
My fucking dentist tells me,
"You're not covered for that."

653
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:24,190
Bullshit cosmetics!

654
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,320
I got a freaking tooth
split in half here, all right?

655
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:29,530
Write that shit in
as a cavity or something.

656
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,070
- Did he?
- Yeah, he did.

657
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,660
Fucking department
got the bullshit dental plan.

658
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,830
That's our man, right there.
Red bag, right?

659
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,540
- Is that the guy?
- Let's go.

660
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,750
Hands up!
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

661
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,260
- What the fuck you got?
- Get on the ground.

662
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,300
- So, how did you get caught?

663
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,720
Tommy Suits used to say
that in any con,

664
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:56,560
sooner or later somebody's gonna
start asking the right questions.

665
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,520
Usually, it takes a little longer.

666
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,730
Gordo: Am I the only one who feels like we
can't make a move,

667
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,310
with this guy on us?
I think we should ditch him.

668
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:06,570
Jake: No, we need him and dummy up.
Here he comes.

669
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,280
Gordo:
Ah, here he is. Hey, hey.

670
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,030
How's the hoop, superstar? Clean?

671
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,870
What the fuck is it with you
and bathrooms, huh? Tell me.

672
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,500
Miles: Hey, he can't use a restroom
unless he knows it's clean.

673
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,290
- What's the matter with that?
- Manly, all right, wise guy?

674
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,340
That's cute.

675
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:29,840
You know this is
a major metropolitan city, brother.

676
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,130
Public sanitation
does not run very high

677
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:34,180
on the City Hall agenda.

678
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:37,140
You know what you can get
off a toilet seat or a doorknob?

679
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,930
You wanna run down the list?

680
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,980
Hepatitis.
You ever hear of that?

681
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,440
Influenza.
The fucking flesh-eating disease.

682
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:47,230
- I'm eating.
- Yeah, we noticed.

683
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,280
Do you need a shovel
down there, dear?

684
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,660
Gordo, Gordo.
That's enough, all right?

685
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,950
We gotta get down
to business, here. Miles!

686
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,950
We're gonna need you to find us
a mark inside of Price's bank.

687
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:01,960
Somebody we can work with.
Gordo, we're gonna need papers.

688
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,630
Corporate insurance,
a letter of intent, the whole nine.

689
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,170
- All fugazze?
- No, no, no

690
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,210
Corporate papers
have got to be legit.

691
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:11,670
We're all gonna need new IDs.
You gotta make sure they're clean.

692
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,630
Go talk to Suits,
and he'll hook you up.

693
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,300
- What about Customs?
- Don't worry about Customs,

694
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,760
I'll take care of that.

695
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,810
We're gonna need
some start-up cash, first.

696
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,850
Lupus, you think the King
would be willing to bank us?

697
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,860
You already owe him.

698
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,400
Lupus,
we need a banker for this.

699
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,190
We can't do this job
without a banker.

700
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,240
- Gordo, do we need a banker?
- I think so, yes.

701
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:35,320
- Jake: I think we need a banker.
- I don't know, man

702
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,700
- You could try.
- He's not gonna listen to me.

703
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:40,290
I bet if you talk to him,
loosen him up,

704
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,040
- maybe he'll listen to you.
- All right! I'll try, okay?

705
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,080
Don't do us any favors,
all right?

706
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,080
Jesus, join the team!

707
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,090
So, you guys are good?
You know what you need to do?

708
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,590
- Yeah.
- All right!

709
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,840
Lupus, Lily, we'll go over
to see the King, now.

710
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,180
- All right!
- Jake: Ready to roll?

711
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,220
Let's do it.

712
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,230
I'm not finished.

713
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,440
She's not finished.

714
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,530
Gordo: What's wrong with you?
Where's your manners?

715
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,280
Nice!
You know why?

716
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,320
Because it's real.
You're licking each other.

717
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,910
- Feels good?
- Feels so good.

718
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,790
All right, that's it...
what? What, what?

719
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,830
Jake is here,

720
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,000
He wants you to stake him
a couple hundred grand.

721
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:27,040
No, he's supposed to be getting me
money, not costing me money.

722
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,210
He says we need it.
And I gotta say, boss,

723
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,750
- this guy's pretty sharp, you know?
- Look at me, look at me.

724
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,800
- You're getting a crush on him?
- What are you talking about?

725
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,720
Don't let him get into your head, 'cause
he's a charmer.

726
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,430
You tell him to wait a minute
and then you bring him in.

727
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,510
He's right behind you.

728
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,770
Get outta here.
Get outta here.

729
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,430
You're starting
to scare me, sport. Harlin!

730
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,560
200K?
Isn't that more than you owe me?

731
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,610
Jake: You're just gonna have
to trust me on this, all right?

732
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,360
Oh, no.
You're a day late on trust.

733
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,700
I think that what he's trying
to say is that he'Il...

734
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:02,540
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

735
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:05,450
You brought her for a reason,
didn't you, booster?

736
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,460
Let's listen to her.

737
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:10,540
No, why don't you listen up?

738
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:13,050
Even though I'm running
the show for you,

739
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,880
I'm still running the show.

740
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,300
So we're gonna put an end to

741
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:21,050
the scooter- junior-skippy-sport-
tiger-booster bullshit.

742
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:23,100
The name is Jake.

743
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,600
What do you say you get
the ADD under control?

744
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,730
You look me in the eye
when I'm talking to you.

745
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,440
- What's your name, honey?
- Her name is Lily.

746
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:36,490
Booster, have I ever
referred to you as honey?

747
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,030
Have I, scooter?

748
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,870
It's a common mistake that Jake
is making when he says ADD.

749
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:43,370
What he really means is ADHD,

750
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,000
for Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder, see?

751
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,750
The important word is the H,

752
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,580
Hyperactivity.
I don't understand,

753
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,040
why do you let her do that
if you care about her?

754
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,000
It's poison, see?

755
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,300
Feel my heart.

756
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:00,630
Go ahead. I bet it beats
twice as fast as yours.

757
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:03,680
- Go on feel it.
- I'm fine, thanks.

758
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:07,180
Oh, come on. Will you feel my heart?
I'm not gonna bite you.

759
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,230
God, you feel good.

760
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,440
Like a trip-hammer, right?

761
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:21,280
See? Much faster...

762
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,160
than yours.

763
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,870
Why am I enjoying this

764
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:32,210
so much, Jake?

765
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,710
Because

766
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,840
I feel like she is

767
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,210
too.

768
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,890
I'm sorry,
I know that was tasteless, dear.

769
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,470
I was just trying
to make a point to Jake, okay?

770
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:50,140
What do you say you get
your ADD under control,

771
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,520
and we get to the fucking point?

772
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,690
Ooh, I think Jake is referring
to my medication,

773
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,730
which I thought was confidential.

774
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:00,490
Jacob, come on, come on.

775
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,320
You know why I take that stuff.

776
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,370
Because if I don't, I become hyper,

777
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,580
or primitive, right?
Or impulsive.

778
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:10,910
You never know when
I'm going to lose it.

779
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,080
Now listen to me, okay?

780
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,250
Hey!

781
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,630
I'm not a violent man.

782
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,090
I like to think
I am above that, right?

783
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:25,050
You took my money
and now you're asking for more.

784
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:27,930
And I'm gonna give you... I'm gonna
give you what you're asking for,

785
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,560
- which is, how much? Tell me again.
- 200.

786
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:34,270
200, how much is that altogether?

787
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:37,730
Including what you took
from me the first time?

788
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,780
350.

789
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:42,110
Oh, that's very good,
you're smart, aren't you?

790
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:45,030
You told me you were smart.
You're a smart, smart, smart guy!

791
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,070
So be smarter, huh?

792
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:51,750
Don't get hurt.
Don't scare me.

793
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:55,250
You've got a good, healthy,
long life ahead of you.

794
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,290
I like you,
now say, "We're set."

795
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,800
- "We're set."
- Say it like you like me too.

796
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,300
Come on, you can do it.

797
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:05,260
Say, "we're set"
like you like me.

798
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,300
We're set.

799
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,140
Okay, now I want you
to take your lovely,

800
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:13,180
lovely lady home.

801
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:17,150
Oh my God,
you're beautiful.

802
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,440
Let's go.

803
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,450
Don't you ever, ever

804
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,450
let anyone stand behind me,
without me knowing.

805
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,410
You hear me?
You understand me?

806
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,460
Man: So the King
gave you the money.

807
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,710
Jake: Now, we just needed
to find our guy in Price's bank.

808
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,380
Jake: What you're looking for
in a mark

809
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:42,960
is someone whose weaknesses
you can exploit.

810
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,170
Michelle Strigo, loan officer.

811
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,220
Jake: Guy like me,
people like that,

812
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:49,850
I tell you what you're looking for
without even meeting you.

813
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,140
(woman screams)

814
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:54,640
You fucking asshole!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

815
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,730
You cocksucker!

816
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,440
Jake: It's like a personal ad
you wear over your head.

817
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,780
- She's not gonna work.
- You sure?

818
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:10,160
Jay Housler,
VP of international finance.

819
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,210
No.

820
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:34,180
Leon Ashby,
VP of corporate loans.

821
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,690
What you're looking for in a mark
is someone who has nothing to lose.

822
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,730
No friends. No family. No life.

823
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,280
You're looking for a guy
who doesn't own a rug.

824
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:47,280
Jake:
Oh yeah, he's perfect.

825
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:50,240
- Miles: You sure?
- Hey, I'm sure.

826
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:51,280
Ashby was the right mark.

827
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,700
Now I needed to see if Lily was
the right shill, so I tested her.

828
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,500
One watch engraved,
"To Carolyn,

829
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,790
Happy Graduation Counselor,
Love, Mom and Dad."

830
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,830
- Good.
- One bracelet engraved,

831
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:03,590
"To Annie,
Happy 25th Anniversary, Love, Tom."

832
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,340
- Perfect!
- I'll be right back, Mr. Lewis.

833
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:07,670
- Okay, thank you.

834
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,720
Excuse me, I think you have
something on hold for me.

835
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:13,050
- Do you have a ticket?
- I lost it but the name is Hanson.

836
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:15,680
- Okay
- Thanks a lot.

837
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,390
- Mr. Lewis, right?
- Yes?

838
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:22,100
- Jake Hanson. I go to Law School
with your daughter Carolyn.

839
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:26,900
- We met a couple of times, before.
- Oh, of course, Jake!

840
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,530
- It's good to see you again.
- Good to see you too.

841
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,070
You remember... Lily!

842
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:35,660
This beautiful woman is my wife.

843
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:37,950
Lily, this is Carolyn's father.

844
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:41,000
- Oh, nice to meet you.
- Pleasure, I'm sure.

845
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:44,130
So, what brings you down
from Stanford?

846
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,340
Taking advantage of
the long weekend?

847
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:50,380
- Yeah, we're...
- It's our first anniversary!

848
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,800
Congratulations!
That's great.

849
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,760
Carolyn is down
for the weekend too.

850
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,970
- Really?
- Mm-mm, yeah.

851
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,140
Maybe you can
do me a favor then.

852
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,600
We split the cost on a couple
of books, last semester,

853
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,150
and I never got an opportunity
to pay her back,

854
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,070
- I'll just write you a check.
- There's nothing for Hanson.

855
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,980
If we had a ticket,
I could check the computer.

856
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,240
But yesterday, my wallet

857
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:14,740
and my wife's purse were stolen,
and the ticket was in my wallet.

858
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,160
Maybe, you could check again.

859
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:19,500
Jesus, where did this happen?

860
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:22,210
We're staying at the Peninsula,

861
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,670
I think it might have been
the housekeeping staff.

862
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:28,300
But Jake has a little more faith
in humanity than I do.

863
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:31,010
He hates me saying it,
but I think it's true.

864
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:34,300
You have to be so careful
these days.

865
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,850
You sure do.

866
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,810
Honey,
I'm just gonna go

867
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,180
and pick out a wallet.
It was nice to meet you.

868
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:44,270
- Nice to meet you.
- There you are Mr. Lewis.

869
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:47,310
- Good.
- I'm sorry, sir, still nothing.

870
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:50,480
- May I ask what it was?
- It's a shame, it was

871
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,570
a pair of...
a pair of diamond earrings.

872
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,610
Actually,
it's just like those.

873
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:56,820
- We have those in stock.
- Oh great.

874
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,030
- Let me write you a check
- Only with the proper ID.

875
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:01,540
Yeah, I understand that but
like I just explained to you,

876
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:04,460
my wallet was...

877
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:08,000
this is sort of a very special day for my
wife and I,

878
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,090
it being our first anniversary.

879
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,670
She thinks we're here to pick up
something for my mother,

880
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:16,720
but I wanted to surprise her
with something special.

881
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,140
So if you think you can
make an exception today,

882
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,390
- just this one time.
- I'm sorry.

883
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,560
Thank you.

884
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:31,030
Please, tell Carolyn I said hello
and pass the note for her.

885
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,400
- I sure will.
- It was good to see you again.

886
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,030
Good to see you.

887
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,620
Look, Jake,

888
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:42,160
why don't you
write me a check,

889
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,000
and let me put the earrings
on my credit card?

890
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,750
Is that all right with you?

891
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,880
If you'd be willing to do that,
that would be great.

892
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:51,500
Good. Please.

893
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:02,470
- Mr. Lewis, thanks again.
- You bet, Jake.

894
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,190
Happy Anniversary.

895
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,440
All right? Now that's how
you pull a con.

896
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:13,110
So smile like you just got a present
from the man of your dreams.

897
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:15,150
Thank you!

898
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,660
You're welcome, now let's give it
a strong finish, all right?

899
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:39,890
He's gone.

900
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,600
- Oh yeah.
- I gotta go get a haircut.

901
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:52,020
Hey, how you doing?

902
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,020
Hey guys,
good to see you, man.

903
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,070
What's up, boss?

904
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,110
- Right here.
- That's good.

905
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:01,240
- What are you having?
- I'm gonna go light,

906
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:03,490
I'm gonna get the chicken
and rib combo.

907
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:04,990
That's light?

908
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:07,040
Yeah,
I'm not getting the coleslaw.

909
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:09,290
So, what's good here?

910
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:14,590
- Who the fuck are you?
- Special Agent Gunther Butan.

911
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:18,170
- Special agent?
- I'm looking for Jake Vig.

912
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:22,850
- Who?
- Who? The invisible man.

913
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,350
The specter,
the spook, the ghost.

914
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,390
But then the other day,
like a gift,

915
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,810
a buddy of his,
a crew member,

916
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,850
Alphonse Moorely...

917
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:35,270
you know Alphonse Moorely.
He wakes up with a hole in his head.

918
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:37,860
Look, Special Agent...
what's your name?

919
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:40,280
- Butan!
- I got a pretty good sense of humor

920
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:42,320
- like most people.
- Really, you've a sense of humor?

921
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,740
- Yeah, I do. So if this is
some kind of a fucking joke,

922
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,660
- I'm not into this shit!
- A joke?!

923
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,700
A couple of years ago,
I'm working undercover on a case

924
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:52,170
that Jake Vig is involved with.
He's running some sort of scam

925
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,540
importing merchandise
for some guy in Tampa.

926
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,210
And I got close,
real close, and he knew it.

927
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:59,260
In order to let me know,
and to rub it in,

928
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:01,840
he sent me this tie. Since then,
I've been following him,

929
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,010
from Chicago to Denver
to Salt Lake City,

930
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,810
to Phoenix and I've been
wearing this tie ever since,

931
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,850
because it keeps me motivated.

932
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,810
That's a real nice tie. I don't know if it
says, "Special Agent."

933
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:14,100
You know what it says?
It says,

934
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:17,230
"You can't catch me,
so fuck you. So fuck you."

935
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:20,150
- And fuck you!
- Hey!

936
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:25,450
Temper's a sign of weakness.
Temper's a sign of weakness.

937
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,370
Hey man, can we get you
a glass of water?

938
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,290
I'm working at this
temper management issue.

939
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:33,580
My doc says
I should stay calm,

940
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,210
because I might do
or say something

941
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,000
- that I might regret later.
- Look, Special Agent...

942
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:43,010
- sell one drug dealer's drugs
to another drug dealer?

943
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,050
Hey, hey,
can you put that away?

944
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:48,220
- Wow!
- Hey, hey, hey...

945
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,770
Butan: Let's take a walk.
Let's go for a walk.

946
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,810
Now here is the deal...

947
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,810
You guys are gonna help me catch
Jake Vig. Whatever he's into next,

948
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:59,610
you guys are gonna be into.
And whatever you're into, I'm into.

949
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,360
This fucking gun
is killing my back.

950
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,410
In exchange, I'm gonna make sure you
guys are cleared

951
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,030
of any past associations with Vig

952
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,200
as part of a
cross-departmental investigation,

953
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,160
and that home movie I got,
I'll make sure

954
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,330
that it doesn't move its way
into Internal Affairs.

955
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:15,420
Who knows? This prick
has been on the wish list so long,

956
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:17,130
you two guys,
might even get a promotion.

957
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,550
What the fuck
are you getting out of all this?

958
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:22,090
Peace of mind.

959
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,880
I might even get a chance
to get rid of this fucking tie!

960
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:28,640
Why are you looking at me
that way, Lloyd?

961
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:30,470
Not everybody is on the take.

962
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,220
If you Feds are so hot
for this guy,

963
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,730
why don't you just let us go out?
We'll bring him in, that's it.

964
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,230
A fox isn't a fox until
he's caught in the henhouse.

965
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:40,820
- Oh nice. What is that, an analogy?
- A metaphor.

966
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:43,150
Actually, it's neither
but it is a good deal.

967
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:45,280
You guys go clean,
I get peace of mind,

968
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:48,820
and better yet, Lloyd's daughter
gets to keep her braces,

969
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,870
and have that winning smile,
just like her daddy.

970
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,790
One more thing,

971
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:56,420
you guys can't be running around
with heroin in your car.

972
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:08,300
Jake: Let me tell you
something about Butan.

973
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,350
He's just as crooked
as the next guy.

974
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:14,100
You'd think he'd have something
better to do with taxpayer dollars.

975
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:16,140
Well, cue the fucking violins.

976
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:18,190
Come on, man,
it's getting cold out here.

977
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:21,860
Jake: It was all in play.
Everything!

978
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:23,860
And with a little luck,
we're about to land the mark.

979
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:26,610
- Where the hell is she?
- I have no idea.

980
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,780
- She's 10 minutes late.
- Jake: Luck's a funny thing.

981
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,080
- Especially the bad.
- She's nice.

982
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:33,450
Black cats, breaking a mirror,

983
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,870
- breathe on a match.
- (doorbell rings)

984
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:37,370
- It's about time.
- Believe it.

985
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:41,880
Believe it all. But if you really want to talk
about bad luck,

986
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:44,880
redheads.

987
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:47,380
You have got to be
fucking kidding me.

988
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:48,720
Shit.

989
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:51,220
Top three all time worst redheads:

990
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:56,520
Lizzie Borden, axe murderer;

991
00:50:56,590 --> 00:51:00,020
Judas, betrayer;

992
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:03,230
Shirley Vig,

993
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:05,820
abandoner.

994
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,200
Nice to see you too.

995
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:12,530
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

996
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:13,830
Any idea?

997
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,870
What is with the hair?

998
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,750
What?
You told me to change it.

999
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,540
Jake: But the fucking
grand poohbah of all jinxes,

1000
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,590
a bird in your house.

1001
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:26,920
A bird enters your house,
it means death.

1002
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,760
What about this then? What's with the scarf
with the birds?

1003
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:32,720
I mean, do you know what that means?
Do you know what that means?

1004
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:35,180
You have just put
a mother of a jinx on us.

1005
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:39,350
- Gordo, can you believe this?
- Gordo: Oy vey.

1006
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:43,480
We're dead.
We're dead.

1007
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:47,900
Did I miss something, guys?

1008
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:51,360
Sweetheart, it's the red hair.
It's bad luck.

1009
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,910
Miles: It's not like she's
a real redhead, Jake.

1010
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,120
Look, it doesn't
matter, all right?

1011
00:51:56,190 --> 00:52:00,250
You can't fool bad luck,
you can't get by on a technicality.

1012
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,630
You can't trick karma.

1013
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:06,880
You just fucked us.

1014
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:10,930
So much for that
good feeling, huh?

1015
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,970
That's what I get for putting
a chick on the team, right?

1016
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,430
Gordo.
Burn that.

1017
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:22,560
Lupus! Think fast.
Lily, hold on a second, will you?

1018
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:28,320
Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?

1019
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:32,820
- No. Please.
- Thanks.

1020
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:36,240
Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry
I'm late, but I'm not that late.

1021
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,580
You didn't have to
give away my seat.

1022
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:41,500
I didn't know
you were coming.

1023
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:44,250
- I didn't know. Sorry.
- No problem.

1024
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:51,760
Thanks for playing along.
I had to sit down for awhile.

1025
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,720
- Tough day?
- Brutal day.

1026
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:58,600
- What are you drinking?
- Maker's Mark, on the rocks.

1027
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:02,270
- His rocks, mine straight up.
- You got it.

1028
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,650
My name is Leon,
Leon Ashby.

1029
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:11,110
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
I'm overbearing and rude.

1030
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:13,320
Lily.
Lily Finn.

1031
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:19,200
- So what do you do?
- It's more like, what don't I do?

1032
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,290
It's a long story.

1033
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:25,170
Well, we're getting drinks.
What happened?

1034
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:29,590
My partners and I are trying
to secure start-up capital

1035
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,840
for a small tech company.

1036
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:33,880
We tried the venture
capitalist route,

1037
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,890
but since the bubble
burst on dot coms...

1038
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:39,350
You're a few years off the mark.
A lot of bubbles were burst.

1039
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,390
Yeah.

1040
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:44,310
Optimists that we are,
we thought we'd try our luck

1041
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:46,980
with a straight corporate loan.

1042
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:48,270
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1043
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:51,650
- Oh, no, no, I can get this.
- On me. For the seat.

1044
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,570
Chin-chin.

1045
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:06,250
So we've been meeting
with banks all day.

1046
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,630
It's amazing how many
ways they can say no

1047
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,670
without ever actually
saying the word.

1048
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:16,260
Typically, a corporate loan
is a fairly simple matter.

1049
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:20,760
But you do have to demonstrate
a capacity for gross fund recovery.

1050
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,270
Let me guess,

1051
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:25,810
your bubble didn't burst.

1052
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:29,610
No, no, nothing like that.
I work in a bank.

1053
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,860
Really?

1054
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:34,530
I wish we'd met eight hours ago.

1055
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,120
Good evening, gentlemen.

1056
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:44,160
Oh, my partners are here.

1057
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,040
We have dinner plans.

1058
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:50,840
Oh, well, uh...

1059
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:53,420
- thank you for the drink.
- Oh, you're welcome.

1060
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:57,340
I was just going to ask
if you'd like to join us.

1061
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:02,890
- Sure.
- Okay.

1062
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,060
Jake: So she got one leg out from
under him, now we had to lean.

1063
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,980
So then Miles, God bless him,
he walks right into

1064
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:11,440
the fucking Creative Director's office and
he says,

1065
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:13,940
"I'm sorry this
program is for shit."

1066
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:17,320
No, no. And then he throws
like a thousand pages of code

1067
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:20,280
- all over the fucking guy's office!
- Jake: This is our boss, all right?

1068
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,740
So he kicks Miles and I out of the office,
he's screaming and yelling,

1069
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,830
"You're fired. Your whole
fucking team is fired."

1070
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:28,410
Now he's looking for Lily,
he's looking for Lupus,

1071
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:30,540
- and of course he can't find Gordo.
- Miles: That's the best part.

1072
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:32,960
He cannot find Gordo, okay?
So what happens?

1073
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:35,170
- He finally finds...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...

1074
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,300
- you don't have to tell this part.
- He's in the bathroom.

1075
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:40,180
So he kicks down
the stall room door,

1076
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:43,010
and starts screaming
at the top of his lungs.

1077
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:45,010
And there's Gordo,

1078
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,810
his pants around the ankles,

1079
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:51,020
"PC World" mag in hand,
and he's punching the cloud.

1080
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,480
I'm sorry.

1081
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,990
Spanking.
Frankly, I was spanking.

1082
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:02,030
And it was a fucking
traumatizing event,

1083
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:04,700
because I haven't been able to use a public
restroom since that day.

1084
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:06,660
Me neither.

1085
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:08,540
I swear to God.

1086
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:11,870
Gordo's got some issues.
He's got some issues.

1087
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,080
And let's not forget,

1088
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:17,050
the great thing that did come from that day
was we said, "Enough!"

1089
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,380
That's the day we started our
own business and said goodbye

1090
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,970
- to shithead bosses. So...
- Hear, hear.

1091
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,010
Leon: I really admire you guys
taking a chance like that.

1092
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,470
Lily: Leon here works at a bank.
What bank did you say it was?

1093
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,600
Price Trust.

1094
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:31,480
No shit, really?

1095
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:35,480
Talk about shithead bosses.
Now that's gotta be a trip.

1096
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,030
- What's he like to work for?
- Oh, you know. He's okay.

1097
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:41,070
- Really?
- Oh, come on!

1098
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,910
Well, he's a...

1099
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:46,530
he's just a fucking shithead.
What can I tell you?

1100
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,930
So what do you do
over there at Price?

1101
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,010
I'm the VP in charge
of corporate loans.

1102
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:08,060
Wow.

1103
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:11,770
We haven't met anyone
of your level before.

1104
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,060
VP.

1105
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:17,270
Wait, so that means
it's you and then the P.

1106
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,070
Give that man a Nobel Prize.
Well done.

1107
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:23,360
- Genius.
- Yes, that's right.

1108
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,120
Jake: Here's where a little
research comes in handy.

1109
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:28,990
Corporate banks give out
VP titles like calendars.

1110
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:31,910
It's a small lie, but now
we're sure he's playing.

1111
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,790
Then maybe you can help
explain to us what's so difficult

1112
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:37,250
- about getting a corporate loan?
- Well, normally, nothing.

1113
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:40,130
But a tech firm right now?

1114
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,760
People are really scared.

1115
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:45,130
Jake: People are scared
because they lack vision.

1116
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,140
Present company
excluded, of course.

1117
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:51,470
Leon: A bank does need to know
where its money's gonna come from.

1118
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,810
That is true.

1119
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,480
Jake: We know where
we're getting our money back from.

1120
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:59,440
But therein lies our Catch-22.

1121
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:01,610
I don't follow.

1122
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,150
- Well...
- Jake, come on.

1123
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:05,570
No, it's all right.

1124
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:09,620
Leon here is one
of the good guys.

1125
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:11,620
Right?

1126
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:14,660
Jake: Now what I'm gonna tell you is in
complete confidence.

1127
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:16,830
It does not leave
this fucking table.

1128
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,830
- Sure.
- Fine.

1129
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:22,300
You know how the dot commers
did what they did, right?

1130
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:24,050
In what way?

1131
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,970
How they made their money.

1132
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,970
Essentially, they start
with an idea,

1133
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,260
shop it around town,
raise a little capital,

1134
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,310
and then sold it
to a bigger company,

1135
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:36,230
like a Microsoft or an Oracle or
an Intel. You know, whatever.

1136
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,100
That's half right there.

1137
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:40,980
The beauty of it was, they sold it before the
thing was even real.

1138
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:44,570
So you've got the bigger company already
set up to buy the thing.

1139
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,530
They just want to
see that it works.

1140
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,780
So these guys go out, get some start-up
capital, make it work,

1141
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,450
and then sell for five or
six times the initial loan.

1142
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:56,620
They're delicious.

1143
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,880
- But you need a letter of intent.
- Exactly.

1144
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:02,630
And that's our Catch-22.

1145
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,630
We can't really go out
and talk about it,

1146
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:07,090
because if it's public,
potentially we start a bidding war,

1147
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:09,640
and that's considered a breach of
etiquette. Kills the deal.

1148
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:13,220
However, we wait too long, and we're not
considered hot anymore.

1149
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:18,440
And you have this letter of intent?

1150
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:20,020
Jake:
Yes we do.

1151
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:23,650
We're applying the dot com model
to a different product.

1152
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,990
Yeah.

1153
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:28,900
But the dot coms failed.

1154
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,700
- Yeah, but that's only...
- No, with all due respect.

1155
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:33,530
It...

1156
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:36,700
That's going to be
a really tough sell.

1157
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,080
I mean, you guys have
a real battle on your hands.

1158
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:41,710
- That's bullshit.
- Lupus.

1159
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:44,550
Look, sorry, Mr. Ashby.

1160
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:46,550
I didn't mean anything.
But I just don't think

1161
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:49,430
you can argue with the
success of the business model.

1162
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,720
It was really an
overextension of the model

1163
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:54,260
to what turned out to be
a limited consumer demand

1164
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,560
that caused the
dot com collapse.

1165
00:59:56,630 --> 01:00:00,440
Now, applied to a proper product,
with a solid consumer base,

1166
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:02,900
the model still holds up.

1167
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,570
He may be right.

1168
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,610
Jake: Let me be straight
with you, all right?

1169
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:14,070
We're this close to cutting somebody in on
the action,

1170
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:15,620
if they'd be willing to help.

1171
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:19,080
We just need to find
somebody with some balls.

1172
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:22,120
- Shall we order another round?
- Yeah.

1173
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:27,300
Jake: Lupus, nice save in there.
I'm very impressed.

1174
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:29,380
Poor bastard never
knew what hit him.

1175
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:32,640
Jesus Christ, I almost
felt sorry for the guy.

1176
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:34,850
I gotta go work off
some of this adrenaline.

1177
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:38,220
I have an in on a card game with some
Hollywood studio dipshits.

1178
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,270
- Anybody want a piece?
- I'm going home.

1179
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:43,150
- I'll go. Jake?
- No, I'm good.

1180
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,150
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1181
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:48,030
Oh, Lupus, you should come.
You're gonna love these guys.

1182
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,740
Bunch of fucking knobs.

1183
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:51,780
Hey, Lupus.

1184
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:53,820
When this is all over,

1185
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,410
you'll let us know who
the King put on Big Al, right?

1186
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,790
You gonna have time?

1187
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:03,790
I'll find the time.

1188
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:15,970
You want to go, don't you?

1189
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,350
For a couple hundred bucks?
Not interested.

1190
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:20,600
You'd do it for free.

1191
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:23,560
You're almost drooling.
You like the rush.

1192
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:27,020
It's not about the rush.
It's just a job. It's what I do.

1193
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:29,400
Your mother not breast-feed
you or something?

1194
01:01:29,470 --> 01:01:31,530
You asking me if I got
something to prove?

1195
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:35,410
- Do you?
- Not in that repressed anger way.

1196
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,950
I get the feeling you could've bullshitted
your way into anything.

1197
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:41,540
- Why this?
- I'm good at it.

1198
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:43,750
Lying, cheating, manipulating.

1199
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:45,960
It all came very naturally to me.

1200
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:48,590
No, it's more than that.

1201
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:52,550
The thrill of it? I mean, didn't you find it
exciting tonight?

1202
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:55,510
The way you were
working that guy Ashby...

1203
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:58,720
flirting, giving him
your sweet little smile,

1204
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:03,350
brushing up against him,
occasionally touching him,

1205
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,860
I have a feeling you were
getting off on that tonight.

1206
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:14,400
All I did was smile
and shake my ass.

1207
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:17,070
Yeah, but you
did it very well.

1208
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,410
Soon enough you'll
have more to do

1209
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,540
and I have a feeling you'll
be good at that too.

1210
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:24,500
How do you know?

1211
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:26,040
Intuition.

1212
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,090
- She had you tempting fate.
- My old man and his buddies

1213
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:17,260
from work used to play the same lotto
numbers every week.

1214
01:03:17,330 --> 01:03:20,180
I mean the same
numbers for 16 years.

1215
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:24,640
One day he gets pissed, decides he's going
to play his own number.

1216
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:29,270
They then hit the Lucky Seven
for 3.5 million without him.

1217
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:31,810
That's fate for you.

1218
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:34,780
I guess he passed on
that unlucky asshole gene.

1219
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:36,820
Turn around.

1220
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:39,450
You should have trusted me, Jake.

1221
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:42,830
Yeah, apparently so.

1222
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:46,200
Everything looks in order.

1223
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,710
Jake: You know, Leon, we're going
to have to move quickly here.

1224
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:51,290
I know.
It won't go unnoticed.

1225
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,930
What's this?

1226
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,430
Jake:
Let's call that a convincer.

1227
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,690
We're going to need
to slow down a bit.

1228
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,770
You're worried about recouping the loan,
we got the letter of intent.

1229
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,270
No, it's... I understand that.

1230
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:17,820
What I'm trying to...

1231
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:19,900
what I mean to say is...

1232
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:22,360
what I'm wondering about is...

1233
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,120
is my cut.

1234
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:29,120
Jake: And there it is.
Ashby gets the itch.

1235
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:32,540
- 2%.
- Lily: Of five million.

1236
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:35,170
We're gonna make it back
three or four times over.

1237
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:37,920
By the time anyone catches on,
the loan's already been repaid.

1238
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,220
You didn't do anything wrong
except speed things up.

1239
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:44,180
Jake: All you need to do for your cut, is put
some paperwork through,

1240
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:46,970
push a button tomorrow.

1241
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,600
Man: Yeah, but there were
other factors.

1242
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,100
Yeah, factors that weren't
clear to me until now.

1243
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:05,030
What do you got?

1244
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:07,410
We got jack shit.

1245
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:14,290
I'm not a confrontational
man by nature,

1246
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:16,380
but you guys are gonna have
to start working with me.

1247
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:18,420
We haven't heard from Vig.
We don't know if he wants

1248
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:20,840
to cut us in on this shit he's
got going down with the King.

1249
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:23,380
Maybe you two guys need to be
a little more pro-active, Lloyd.

1250
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:27,050
You gotta make him think you're gonna
keep me off his back.

1251
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:28,720
And for that he's
gonna cut you in

1252
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:32,390
on whatever he's got going
with King. You got that?

1253
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:34,100
Omar, you got it?

1254
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:37,520
Flight's booked to Belize.

1255
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,730
Almost home.

1256
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:52,790
Got to get you home to pack.
Get ready for your trip tomorrow.

1257
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:55,000
Can you picture me with
a drink with the umbrella in it?

1258
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:57,130
Little sunscreen on the nose.

1259
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,210
- Hey, Jake!
- Back off! Back off!

1260
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:02,300
- Whoa, whoa!
- Take it easy! Jesus!

1261
01:06:02,370 --> 01:06:05,130
What, the tip not
work out for you guys?

1262
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:08,760
Tip worked out fine, we're just
a little curious about the Fed.

1263
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,810
Hey look, you don't pay
your fucking taxes...

1264
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,940
Get the fuck back!
Back up!

1265
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:18,560
Special Agent Gunther Butan.
That ring a bell?

1266
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:21,480
Gunther? No, I think I would remember a
Gunther.

1267
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:25,820
- Let me jog your memory a little.
- Jesus! Fuck!

1268
01:06:26,610 --> 01:06:28,740
Gunther Butan, you say?

1269
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:32,160
I think I might know this guy.

1270
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,660
Yeah, well he's in town and
he sure as shit remembers you.

1271
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:37,290
What are we gonna
do about this Jake?

1272
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:40,670
We can't afford having
a Fed onto us like this.

1273
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:42,630
I wouldn't dream of that.

1274
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:45,170
Fuck, man!

1275
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:47,640
The way we look at it,
Jake, you have

1276
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:50,850
a limited window of opportunity here
before he catches up to you.

1277
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,270
But I got good news
for you, okay? You got us.

1278
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:56,480
We're your white knights. We're gonna
keep him off your back.

1279
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:58,850
And we get a piece of whatever you got
going down with the King.

1280
01:06:58,930 --> 01:07:01,860
And don't argue with me 'cause
I got a lot of pent-up aggression.

1281
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:04,190
Say something stupid
if we got a deal, Jake.

1282
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,150
Something stupid.

1283
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:13,200
Don't leave town, brother.

1284
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:17,040
- Funny.
- Oh fuck.

1285
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:18,670
Have a nice day, Officers.

1286
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:21,540
How did we do?

1287
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,670
We did exactly like you said.

1288
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:25,710
I have complete
faith in you, Lloyd.

1289
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,380
Lupus: Why's this guy
so hard up for you?

1290
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,510
You're not exactly a threat
to national security.

1291
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:31,390
We go way back.

1292
01:07:31,550 --> 01:07:34,720
Jake: A few years ago we were
working in Tampa for a local goon.

1293
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:37,480
Turns out this mutt was
being watched by the Feds,

1294
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:40,560
which now meant we were
being watched by the Feds...

1295
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:43,730
one in particular...
Agent Gunther Butan.

1296
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:47,650
We were just overseeing
some creative importing,

1297
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,450
so he really didn't
have anything on us.

1298
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,240
But I figured, maybe this
guy's good for a fix.

1299
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,660
Our guys in the LAPD,
give them $20,

1300
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:57,710
they'll look the other way
on a parking ticket.

1301
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,420
Maybe you'll get yourself
a new tie with that.

1302
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:02,460
But a Fed? You get a guy
like that as your fix...

1303
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:05,920
It was probably a stupid idea.
There I was Armani and Rolex.

1304
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,420
There he is,
JC Penny and Timex.

1305
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,260
So I took a shot.

1306
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:12,720
Now he had me on attempted
bribery of a Federal Agent.

1307
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:15,430
So that's how Gunter Butan
and I became friends.

1308
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:17,770
- Butan... shit.
- Here.

1309
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:20,270
So what? We just
stay clear of him.

1310
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:22,560
I don't think so.
I think we gotta walk.

1311
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,900
Wait a minute. We can
handle this. Come on.

1312
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:28,570
No. Not this time.

1313
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,610
I say we walk.

1314
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:32,870
Wait. Take it easy
for a second.

1315
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:36,580
I'm not gonna take it easy.
'Cause you don't know this guy.

1316
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:39,120
He's gonna be all over
us like white on rice.

1317
01:08:39,150 --> 01:08:41,000
There's no shaking him
and you know it.

1318
01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:43,080
So we change
the scam a little.

1319
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,090
There is no more
fucking scam.

1320
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,050
I got a sign
on my back now.

1321
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:50,800
I can't leave town and then show up with a
suitcase full of money.

1322
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:52,760
- It's over. The gig is up.
- Gordo: Jake, Jake.

1323
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:56,060
The skirt's got a point. All you have to do is
tweak it a bit.

1324
01:08:56,130 --> 01:09:00,770
It over. That's it. You gotta
know when to walk away.

1325
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,900
And you guys are too careless with the
money. Gordo with the cars.

1326
01:09:03,970 --> 01:09:06,980
- You with the strippers.
- They call themselves dancers.

1327
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:09,400
They call themselves dancers, huh? What
about Big Al?

1328
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,610
Did that not fucking
register with you?

1329
01:09:11,650 --> 01:09:14,990
Remember seeing him sitting there with a
bullet hole in his head?

1330
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:17,490
That doesn't mean anything?

1331
01:09:17,530 --> 01:09:19,290
You're being such a raving pussy.

1332
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,910
I mean, pull yourself together,
for Christ's sake.

1333
01:09:23,530 --> 01:09:26,840
Who the fuck do you
think you're talking to?

1334
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:31,010
Sweetheart, we fucked
once, okay?

1335
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:34,130
That does not entitle you
a voice in this room.

1336
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:37,430
And don't think I didn't know you weren't
working some angle, either.

1337
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,270
Easy, Jake.
That's a lady.

1338
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:45,310
Everyone's working
an angle, right?

1339
01:09:45,350 --> 01:09:47,480
There are three people
I trust in this world,

1340
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:50,440
those two guys on
the couch and a dead guy.

1341
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,150
You, I don't know you.
You're like a stray dog

1342
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:54,700
that wandered into my house
one day looking for a belly rub.

1343
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:57,530
So why don't you just go back to wherever it
is you came from?

1344
01:09:57,570 --> 01:09:59,700
You don't have anybody
looking for you.

1345
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:02,540
Not the King,
not Butan, not Price.

1346
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:04,370
So just cut loose of this.
It is over.

1347
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:13,010
- What about...
- What about what?

1348
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,640
What about the money?

1349
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:20,560
There it is. That little
itch you need to scratch.

1350
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:22,850
Always about the money.

1351
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,890
What do you want?
You want an apology?

1352
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:27,150
No.
I want my cut.

1353
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:29,860
Take a deep breath,
count to 10,

1354
01:10:29,890 --> 01:10:34,530
and try and get it through
your thick skull, there is no cut.

1355
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:38,530
You're an asshole.

1356
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:43,250
So that's it, huh?

1357
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:47,170
That's it.
We're closing up shop.

1358
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:49,710
You guys know
what to do, right?

1359
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:52,250
Jesus Christ, Jake, I can't
believe you're gonna just...

1360
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:53,760
Miles.

1361
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:58,550
Man: So much for honor
among thieves.

1362
01:10:58,590 --> 01:11:00,850
You were going to cut loose your friends,
your girl...

1363
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:02,890
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1364
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:05,060
I was doing it for them.
I was trying to protect them.

1365
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:07,600
Bullshit. You weren't doing it
for them. You were scared.

1366
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:11,360
Come on, admit it. You lost your nerve and
you lost your confidence.

1367
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:13,400
You weren't trying
to be noble.

1368
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:16,150
You weren't trying to save anyone but your
goddamn self. Admit it.

1369
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:18,660
You got no idea what
you're talking about.

1370
01:11:18,730 --> 01:11:20,410
- It's not true.
- It is fucking true.

1371
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:24,580
They were right there for you!
She was right there for you.

1372
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:29,250
Look at her.
I fucking said look at her!

1373
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:32,460
She trusted you,
and you sold her out.

1374
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:34,550
Now I want you to look at her,

1375
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:37,260
and I want you to tell her.

1376
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:40,300
Be a fucking man.
You be honest.

1377
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:44,100
You tell her.

1378
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:47,060
You tell her that you loved her,

1379
01:11:47,130 --> 01:11:49,810
but the fucking money
meant more to you.

1380
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:55,990
Fucking grifters, man.

1381
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:58,400
Gentleman's racket,
my fucking ass.

1382
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,660
Just another low-life scammer looking out
for number one.

1383
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:03,530
Get the fuck up!

1384
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:04,830
Get the fuck up!

1385
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:08,080
Lupus:
The King ain't gonna like this.

1386
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:11,580
He had a real thing with
getting this Price guy.

1387
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:14,130
If you ask me,
I think he's jealous.

1388
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,760
- Of what? They're both crooks.
- They actually grew up

1389
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:19,010
in the same neighborhood.
King talks about it all the time.

1390
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,050
How come he's always
humping it out,

1391
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:23,890
while Price gets to walk
around in three-piece suits,

1392
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:27,350
hobnob with movie stars,
own a bank, that type of shit.

1393
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:31,690
Next to Price, the King is still small time
and he's pissed off.

1394
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:34,520
A point, Lupus.
Give us a point.

1395
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:39,200
I don't give a shit if he thinks he's a pimple
on Price's ass.

1396
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:41,320
He wouldn't piss on my face
if my teeth were on fire.

1397
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,490
That's nice.
Interesting imagery.

1398
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:48,370
Look at that.
The size of a cigar, right?

1399
01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:51,870
You know why I got that? The King asked
me for a four-shot one day.

1400
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:53,920
That's four-shots of espressos.

1401
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:56,500
Turns out we only have
enough coffee for a three-shot.

1402
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:58,630
So I'm thinking, maybe
I'm doing him a favor.

1403
01:12:58,710 --> 01:13:00,670
And before he even
comes picks it up,

1404
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:03,800
he's screaming at me like
I just hit on his mother!

1405
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,970
I assume this is going to
lead to some kind of point.

1406
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:10,020
This is what I get for bringing
him the wrong fucking cup of coffee,

1407
01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:13,150
imagine what he's
going to do to you.

1408
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,400
Jake: I have to admit,
he did have a point.

1409
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:18,820
There was no way the King
was going to let us slide.

1410
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:21,110
Yeah, so we were back on.

1411
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:23,200
After you cut her loose?

1412
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:25,370
Which was apparently
my mistake.

1413
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,910
How'd you know we'd
still go through with it?

1414
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:30,000
I know you, Jake.

1415
01:13:31,070 --> 01:13:33,040
And I know how to
take care of myself.

1416
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,340
Morgan Price, please.

1417
01:13:42,830 --> 01:13:46,890
Yeah, I'd be interested in that.

1418
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,220
Why don't you give me an address

1419
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:52,890
and I'll send over a car?

1420
01:13:54,590 --> 01:13:58,270
And you and I can discuss
the particulars of your proposal.

1421
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:00,230
No.

1422
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:02,280
I come to you and
I only deal with you.

1423
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,950
It was a smart play.

1424
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:09,330
She handed me to you
on a silver platter.

1425
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:12,040
Silver platter? Motherfucker,
let me tell you a story.

1426
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:16,960
That's an exciting story.
Travis,

1427
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:20,250
anybody ever try
something like this before?

1428
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:22,010
Not that I can recall.

1429
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,930
And how much did you say you
wanted for this finder's fee?

1430
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,510
10%.

1431
01:14:26,590 --> 01:14:30,390
I studied under a Nobel Laureate
of Economics at Cambridge

1432
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:33,140
and I think even she'd
say 10 was high.

1433
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:37,520
I don't give a fuck if you studied at Marice's
Academy of Wig Design.

1434
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,900
You're lucky I'm even here.

1435
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:44,110
- 10 is standard.
- Okay.

1436
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:47,780
Travis, see if you can get him
to tell you how he did it.

1437
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,450
Or almost did it.

1438
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:54,040
Sounds like a good story.

1439
01:14:54,110 --> 01:14:56,080
Oh, I'll get it.

1440
01:14:58,410 --> 01:15:00,170
Come on,
what happened today?

1441
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:03,260
Today?
Today started off great.

1442
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:07,510
Jake: Ashby was going to call us
with the exact time of the transfer.

1443
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:09,510
The King was waiting on us.

1444
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:12,640
Just to be safe, Gordo was
boarding the plane instead of me.

1445
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:16,310
I needed Manzano and Whitworth
to keep Butan off our backs.

1446
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:19,440
So I had to stay in town
and cut them in on the deal.

1447
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:22,730
So they waited for my call
while Miles and I waited for Ashby.

1448
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:25,280
She should be landing
right about now.

1449
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:27,660
That Customs guy is ready, right?

1450
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:30,700
I feel lucky today, Miles.
Real lucky.

1451
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:33,410
Found a penny,
heads up.

1452
01:15:33,490 --> 01:15:35,870
And I got rid of the redhead.

1453
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:39,500
Yeah. We got rid
of the redhead.

1454
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:42,880
Jake?

1455
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:45,010
Customs?

1456
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,880
They say a good chess player
can see up to 20 moves deep.

1457
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,510
That means in some games you've
calculated every move in your head.

1458
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:56,230
The game's over,
even before it's really started.

1459
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:59,190
Like a game of chess,
same with a con.

1460
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:01,360
You have to see that deep.

1461
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,020
- Yeah?
- Ashby,

1462
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,690
- It's Vig.
- Jake, yeah.

1463
01:16:06,230 --> 01:16:08,200
It's going through...

1464
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,820
right... now.

1465
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,370
Good.

1466
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:15,910
And with the push of a button,
all the pieces were in play.

1467
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:18,580
Gordo?
It's all good. Do it.

1468
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:35,260
First and goal.

1469
01:16:44,470 --> 01:16:46,900
Hi there.

1470
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:49,450
I'd like this cashed, please.

1471
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:55,700
Receptionist:
Mr. Ashby?

1472
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:58,910
Mr. Thompson from international calling. He
has a 34-R

1473
01:16:58,950 --> 01:17:00,750
on a corporate
account in Belize.

1474
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:05,750
That's probably just a new
account marker, I'II...

1475
01:17:05,790 --> 01:17:08,130
Jake: To ensure we weren't
going to welch,

1476
01:17:08,210 --> 01:17:12,010
Ashby's cut was transferred
into his own offshore account.

1477
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:15,970
Tell you what.
I am going to lunch.

1478
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:19,430
You tell him I'll
call him back later.

1479
01:17:23,970 --> 01:17:26,650
Jake: We called them
the Green Twinkies.

1480
01:17:34,730 --> 01:17:37,160
We got Twinkies.

1481
01:17:37,230 --> 01:17:39,290
Gordo, that's outstanding.
Good work.

1482
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:43,580
Lupus,
we got the money.

1483
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:45,630
I don't believe this.

1484
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:48,960
Gordo's flying back
with it now.

1485
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,840
So we'll head on over to the bar, meet up
with everybody there.

1486
01:17:52,170 --> 01:17:55,220
I sent Miles to the airport
to wait for Gordo to land.

1487
01:17:55,290 --> 01:17:57,260
Everything was going
as planned.

1488
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:59,100
Gordo?

1489
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:07,860
Gordo, do me a favor. Just use the
bathroom on the plane, all right?

1490
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:10,190
Gordo?
Gordo!

1491
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:14,240
Guy's walking around with
$5 million cash

1492
01:18:14,310 --> 01:18:16,780
and he's going to stop to use
a public bathroom at the airport?

1493
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:18,780
Un-fucking-believable.

1494
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:21,080
That guy's got
a serious problem.

1495
01:18:21,150 --> 01:18:23,120
You're telling me.

1496
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:27,710
Here's where I got stupid, here's
where I got that big fucking itch.

1497
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:34,130
What?
I got something on me?

1498
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:36,390
I'm going to be straight
with you, Lupus.

1499
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:38,970
I don't think we could've
gotten this far without you.

1500
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:41,140
So I got a little
proposition for you.

1501
01:18:41,210 --> 01:18:44,690
A way for us to clear
the whole five million.

1502
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:49,320
Now think about that,
five million split four ways.

1503
01:18:49,390 --> 01:18:51,940
You want in?

1504
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:55,070
- What do I have to do?
- All right.

1505
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,570
Yeah, it's Vig.

1506
01:18:57,650 --> 01:19:00,530
I'm gonna need an escort.
Not a ride, just an escort.

1507
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:02,910
Ontario Airport.
Look for Gordo.

1508
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:05,160
He's going to be carrying
a black Nike duffel bag.

1509
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:08,920
- You guys take care of Butan?
- Don't worry. We got him covered.

1510
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:10,420
All right, good.

1511
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:15,930
That was him. There's a shipment coming
in this afternoon.

1512
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,930
Ontario Airport.

1513
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:20,890
We're going to give Mr. Jake Vig the
surprise of a lifetime.

1514
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,930
- FBI Agent Rosen speaking.
- Artie. Butan.

1515
01:19:24,010 --> 01:19:27,900
Yeah. Ontario Airport this afternoon. Come
heavy.

1516
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:33,530
All we need you to do is call
the King. Tell him it's all good.

1517
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,570
Get the King off of our backs.

1518
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:42,410
Yeah, boss, it's me, Lupus.

1519
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:45,250
You were right.
He's trying to fuck you.

1520
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,500
- What?
- Vig's trying to fuck you.

1521
01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:49,710
Police escorts are going
to pick up the money.

1522
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:53,210
I knew it, I knew it... I should
have listened to my instinct.

1523
01:19:53,290 --> 01:19:55,260
Shit! How do we get
the money now?

1524
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:56,380
You gonna have to
take it in the airport.

1525
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:59,510
The guy he's got a black
Nike duffel bag on wheels.

1526
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:01,220
He's got this thing
with bathrooms.

1527
01:20:01,290 --> 01:20:03,810
If he makes it through Customs he'll be
heading for the john.

1528
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,640
That's good. We'll get him
with his pants down.

1529
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:07,480
You'll take care of scooter
once we get the money.

1530
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:11,230
Maybe Gordo's got it right.

1531
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:14,480
Maybe we're all just looking
for a safe place to shit.

1532
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:20,070
That's cute.

1533
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:22,070
Very cute.

1534
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:31,830
What about all that
bullshit at the bar?

1535
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:35,630
About your three-shot,
four-shot espresso sob story?

1536
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:39,260
Showing me your little boo-boo. What was
all that fucking shit?

1537
01:20:40,290 --> 01:20:44,720
That? I got that
at a barbecue, grilling halibut.

1538
01:21:03,190 --> 01:21:06,370
- Lloyd: You trust this Butan guy?
- I don't trust anybody.

1539
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:09,210
Lloyd: I'm so sick of listening
to this douche bag's shit.

1540
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:10,710
I swear to fucking God.

1541
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:12,290
If my kid's teeth
weren't so fucked up,

1542
01:21:12,370 --> 01:21:14,420
I'd love to walk up to that dude and take
that gay hat of his

1543
01:21:14,490 --> 01:21:16,460
and shove it right up
his ass on principle.

1544
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:18,630
You see how bad
this guy wants Vig?

1545
01:21:18,710 --> 01:21:20,550
It's like a sickness.

1546
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:23,140
I say we collar him ourselves.
That way we got Vig,

1547
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:25,350
we got leverage and we trade.

1548
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:27,390
Vig for the tape.

1549
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:29,770
This is Butan.
You guys awake?

1550
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,560
Yeah, we're here.

1551
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,400
Okay, stay sharp.

1552
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:53,290
- Be right back.
- Is this it?

1553
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:55,330
This it, Harlin?

1554
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:57,880
Motherfucking no brains,
this one has.

1555
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:02,050
Jake: So Lupus.
What do you do now?

1556
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,970
You go back to fetching
coffee for the King?

1557
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:08,350
Don't worry about me.
Stop trying to fuck with my head.

1558
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:20,190
Okay, I got him.

1559
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:51,180
He's heading towards
the east exit.

1560
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:54,060
Do not under any
circumstances apprehend.

1561
01:22:54,130 --> 01:22:56,980
I want you to follow him
all the way down to Vig's.

1562
01:22:57,010 --> 01:23:00,110
- Roger that.
- We got that jerkoff. Let's go.

1563
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:17,880
Keep your pants on.
He just went into the crapper.

1564
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:34,310
Jake: Let's say Gordo doesn't
make it through Customs.

1565
01:23:34,340 --> 01:23:36,640
You're gonna be just
as fucked as we are.

1566
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:39,730
- You think about that?
- Not for nothing, Jake,

1567
01:23:39,810 --> 01:23:41,940
but the guy who
whacked your buddy?

1568
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:43,980
It was me.

1569
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,860
The King usually farms out
for that kind of stuff,

1570
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:52,200
but he was so pissed off at you he couldn't
wait for the regular guy.

1571
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:55,330
The fucker didn't even put
down the kung pao chicken.

1572
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:05,300
Oo-ooh, shit!

1573
01:24:06,330 --> 01:24:08,630
Come on.
Stand up.

1574
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,800
- What?
- Stand the fuck up!

1575
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,720
Jake, no offense,
but I've seen you fight.

1576
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,350
You gotta be kidding me.

1577
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:23,190
Okay, they pulled a switch.

1578
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:26,150
Black man, brown suit. Big.

1579
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:46,010
Hey, asshole.

1580
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:54,050
- (police sirens blare)
- Lloyd: Keep 'em up nice and high.

1581
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:59,520
Lloyd:
What the...

1582
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:07,320
- Don't fucking move.
- Freeze!

1583
01:25:07,390 --> 01:25:09,280
- Freeze!
- Freeze!

1584
01:25:09,310 --> 01:25:11,610
Put your weapon down!

1585
01:25:11,650 --> 01:25:13,780
We're LAPD!

1586
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:16,450
- Get down on your knees.
- We're fucking cops.

1587
01:25:16,530 --> 01:25:19,710
LAPD, man.
Look at this, come on.

1588
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:30,090
- On the curb!
- Face forward! All the way down!

1589
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:31,970
Hands on your head.

1590
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:33,680
Hands outside where
we can see them.

1591
01:25:33,750 --> 01:25:35,600
Bring him out.
Nice and easy. Turn around.

1592
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:39,270
Can I make a suggestion?

1593
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:43,060
Take these cuffs home and use
them on your wife. You'll like it.

1594
01:25:47,890 --> 01:25:50,530
I like it tight, but not that tight.
How about you?

1595
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:51,950
- Let's go.
- Oh.

1596
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:05,630
Look what we got here.

1597
01:26:06,990 --> 01:26:09,000
Heroin. Two keys.

1598
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:14,010
We're good.

1599
01:26:18,630 --> 01:26:21,060
He's good.
He's good.

1600
01:26:21,130 --> 01:26:23,140
- He who?
- You gotta like it.

1601
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:25,650
Officers Manzano
and Whitworth,

1602
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,690
Agent Artie Rosen,

1603
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:29,690
Federal Bureau of Investigations.

1604
01:26:29,770 --> 01:26:32,570
How hard do you think it is to sell one
dealer's drugs to another?

1605
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:34,200
Don't fucking say anything!

1606
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,200
(cell phone ringing)

1607
01:26:47,910 --> 01:26:49,590
Yeah.

1608
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:52,340
The King just got
pinched with the bag.

1609
01:26:52,370 --> 01:26:54,130
Okay.

1610
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,930
What happened?

1611
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:02,480
- He got caught.
- What?

1612
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:05,060
Fucking King just
got us all pinched.

1613
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:08,690
Oh shit! What do I do?
What the fuck...

1614
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,570
Lupus, just
calm down. Lupus!

1615
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,570
(gunshot)

1616
01:27:21,690 --> 01:27:24,710
- I never thanked you for that.
- No problem.

1617
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:27,630
Can we all stop being so fucking polite and
get to the point?

1618
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:29,880
That's right,
where's the fucking money, Jake?

1619
01:27:29,950 --> 01:27:31,920
What do you get out of this?
A fucking finder's fee?

1620
01:27:31,950 --> 01:27:34,340
It's all about
the money, isn't it?

1621
01:27:34,410 --> 01:27:37,010
Fuck you.
You sold me out.

1622
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:39,260
You sold me out huge.
You should have trusted me,

1623
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:41,640
like I trusted you.
You fucked up. You fucked up huge.

1624
01:27:41,710 --> 01:27:43,390
All right, all right,
now you turn the fuck around.

1625
01:27:43,470 --> 01:27:46,440
The only way you're gonna live
is if you get me my fucking money!

1626
01:27:46,510 --> 01:27:48,520
Now where the fuck is it?

1627
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:52,320
I'm gonna ask you one more time before
your brains hit the ground.

1628
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:54,360
Where is my money?

1629
01:27:54,430 --> 01:27:57,950
Probably in the hands of
the Federal Government.

1630
01:27:58,020 --> 01:27:59,780
You know Jake, you...

1631
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:02,540
you really fucking
disappoint me, Jake.

1632
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:05,250
You just let Lily down
here again, too.

1633
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:08,120
What was that you were saying
about playing the big con,

1634
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:11,790
it's like putting on a big play, and everybody
knows their part?

1635
01:28:12,990 --> 01:28:16,760
I guess some people
forgot their fucking lines.

1636
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:19,220
- Yeah, I guess so.
- You guess so?

1637
01:28:19,290 --> 01:28:21,300
So why don't you just take
a deep breath, Jake,

1638
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:23,470
and I'm gonna count to 10.

1639
01:28:23,550 --> 01:28:26,390
One, two...

1640
01:28:26,470 --> 01:28:29,770
three, four, five...

1641
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:32,480
- I do trust you, Lily.
- Six, seven...

1642
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:35,320
- (gunshot)
- Travis: Oh, shit! What the...

1643
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:38,820
- Trust...
- Did you kill him?

1644
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:41,820
- Should be a four-letter word.

1645
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,660
I don't know.

1646
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:49,250
Don't do that shit while
I'm standing right here!

1647
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:53,040
You get the fuck away from me.
Get the fuck out of here! Now!

1648
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:00,970
So I'm dead.
But can I really blame Lily?

1649
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,640
Should I just have trusted her?
Who knows?

1650
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:09,140
Sooner or later, someone's gonna start
asking the right questions.

1651
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:12,480
The Feds would want to know

1652
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:15,520
why were they sent in to just
bust a couple of crooked cops.

1653
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:17,650
Manzano and Whitworth
would ask

1654
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:20,150
how the drugs got
into that duffel bag.

1655
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:24,830
The King and Price would ask,
where their money really went.

1656
01:29:26,030 --> 01:29:28,910
And everyone would ask,
what agency was it that

1657
01:29:28,990 --> 01:29:32,500
Special Agent Gunther Butan
really worked for?

1658
01:29:46,710 --> 01:29:48,680
You need a ride?

1659
01:29:51,090 --> 01:29:52,770
Hey.

1660
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:56,360
How'd it go?

1661
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:58,530
Smooth.

1662
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,570
The guys we have
in the LAPD,

1663
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:02,820
give them $20 and they'll look the other way
on a parking ticket.

1664
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:05,200
Maybe you'll get yourself
a new tie with that?

1665
01:30:05,230 --> 01:30:07,990
But a Fed, you get a guy
like that as your fix...

1666
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:11,910
So what do you
got going next?

1667
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:16,590
So that's how Gunther Butan
and I became friends.

1668
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:19,420
Look at you. You're still
working that crazy tie routine.

1669
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,840
I'm partial to it.

1670
01:30:23,330 --> 01:30:24,890
You take your cut?

1671
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,220
Yeah, I'm good.

1672
01:30:29,170 --> 01:30:31,390
Well, where you off to next?

1673
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:35,560
Wherever it is, don't stay
too long, you know?

1674
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:40,190
- Stay loose.
- Always.

1675
01:30:41,230 --> 01:30:43,070
I'd keep the girl.

1676
01:30:48,780 --> 01:30:52,620
Sooner or later, all the right questions would
get answered.

1677
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:55,460
- Because playing the big con...
- What's this?

1678
01:30:55,490 --> 01:30:57,290
- Is like putting on a play.

1679
01:30:59,450 --> 01:31:01,420
A play where everyone knows
their part, except the mark.

1680
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:05,590
Sometimes, Jake,
style can get you killed.

1681
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:15,350
And like in a game of chess, you've played
every move in your head.

1682
01:31:15,430 --> 01:31:18,060
Yeah, boss.
It's me, Lupus.

1683
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:21,320
You were right.
He's trying to fuck you.

1684
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:25,280
You're a good grifter, man.
It's hard to tell when you're lying.

1685
01:31:25,310 --> 01:31:27,110
It's hard.

1686
01:31:27,150 --> 01:31:30,030
But what do I care?
I'm dead.

1687
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:32,500
Nobody's gonna be
asking me.

1688
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:36,170
I think you dropped
that, baby.

1689
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:39,000
Miles, would you
be so kind?

1690
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:41,000
Absolutely.

1691
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:49,800
* The lights go out
and I can't be saved *

1692
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:53,470
* Tides that I tried
to swim against *

1693
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:57,140
* Have brought me down
upon my knees *

1694
01:31:57,180 --> 01:32:01,270
* Oh I beg, I beg
and plead, singing *

1695
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:04,400
* Come out of things unsaid *

1696
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:08,490
* Shoot an apple
off my head, and a *

1697
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:11,740
* Trouble that can't be named *

1698
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:16,580
* A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing *

1699
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:20,670
* You *

1700
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:23,300
* Are *

1701
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:28,050
* You *

1702
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:30,220
* Are *

1703
01:32:45,270 --> 01:32:48,570
* Confusion never stops *

1704
01:32:48,650 --> 01:32:52,160
* Closing walls
and ticking clocks *

1705
01:32:52,230 --> 01:32:56,000
* Gonna come back
and take you home *

1706
01:32:56,070 --> 01:33:00,170
* I could not stop that
you now know, singing *

1707
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:03,500
* Come out upon my seas *

1708
01:33:03,580 --> 01:33:06,760
* Cursed missed opportunities *

1709
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:10,300
* Am I a part of the cure? *

1710
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:15,060
* Or am I part of the disease?
Singing *

1711
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:19,310
* You *

1712
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:21,600
* Are *

1713
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:26,650
* You *

1714
01:33:26,730 --> 01:33:28,900
* Are *

1715
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:34,030
* You *

1716
01:33:34,110 --> 01:33:36,120
* Are *

1717
01:33:37,610 --> 01:33:41,330
* You *

1718
01:33:41,410 --> 01:33:43,380
* Are *

1719
01:33:59,470 --> 01:34:03,100
* You *

1720
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:05,440
* Are *

1721
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:10,610
* You *

1722
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:12,950
* Are *

1723
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:19,950
* And nothing else compares *

1724
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:27,460
* Oh, nothing else compares *

1725
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:35,260
* And nothing else compares *

1726
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:16,590
* You *

1727
01:35:16,670 --> 01:35:18,760
* Are *

1728
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:23,980
* You *

1729
01:35:24,050 --> 01:35:26,060
* Are *

1730
01:35:26,140 --> 01:35:29,230
* Home, home *

1731
01:35:29,310 --> 01:35:33,360
* Where I wanted to go *

1732
01:35:33,390 --> 01:35:36,570
* Home, home *

1733
01:35:36,650 --> 01:35:40,660
* Where I wanted to go *

1734
01:35:40,730 --> 01:35:43,830

1735
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:48,040
* Where I wanted to go *

* Home, home *

1737
01:35:51,290 --> 01:35:55,380
* Where I wanted to go. *
