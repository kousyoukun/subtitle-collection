1
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,600
Man's voice:
So, I'm dead...

2
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,700
and I think it's because
of this redhead.

3
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,900
Do you know who I am, Jake?

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The Antichrist?

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,600
I'm just a guy
looking for some answers.

6
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,100
Hey, you know, pal,
ain't we all?

7
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,900
Things are probably gonna
end bad for you tonight, Jake.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,100
Yeah, I'm starting
to get that feeling.

9
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,800
Is your life flashing
before your eyes?

10
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,500
Honestly?
Just the last three weeks.

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,300
It's not a bad place to start.

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,200
Calm down, okay? I'm sorry.

13
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,200
I lost my head in there,
I don't know what happened.

14
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,200
You fucking shot him,
that's what happened.

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,200
What other fucking choice do I have?
The motherfucker was gonna welch.

16
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,200
Did you not hear him?
Did you not see him?

17
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,800
I can't be here, man,
do you understand me?

18
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,300
- I can't fucking be here!
- Listen to me, all right?

19
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,200
It went to shit,
that happens sometimes.

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,000
- Oh, fuck, man!
- You're not listening, Lionel.

21
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,000
We can still get through this,
we still have some time,

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,600
but I need you
to use your fucking head,

23
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,600
and I need you to trust me.

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,500
Can you do that?

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,800
- (police sirens blare)
- Let's go!

26
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,600
Jake:
Come on, let's hustle it up.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,600
Come on,
grab his feet, will you?

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,700
Lionel, he's dead, all right?
Maybe you didn't pull the trigger,

29
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,200
but you were standing right there
and you saw me do it.

30
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,300
Now grab his fucking legs.

31
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,900
Bartender:
Tick-tock.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,300
Hey, you wanna help, then help.
If not, shut your piehole.

33
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,300
Your mess!

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,200
Jake: Do me a favor, please,
shut your fucking mouth.

35
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,700
My place.

36
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,500
Maybe now,
you'll shut the fuck up.

37
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,000
Please!

38
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,500
You think this kind of shit
hasn't happened here before?

39
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,300
Given, it's usually on Wednesday and
usually I tell the cops,

40
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,000
"No, officer, I didn't get
a good look at the shooters."

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,600
Usually, anyway...

42
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
I swear to God,
I didn't see anything.

43
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,000
You let me go,
I won't say a word, I promise.

44
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,400
Don't get hysterical on us, sweetheart, all
right?

45
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,000
I can't fucking be here!

46
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,300
Then you know what, Lionel,
maybe you should go.

47
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,000
What about the money?

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,800
What about this situation
makes you think

49
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,000
I can answer that question,
right now?

50
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,200
Fuck! Fuck!

51
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,600
(screams)

52
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,600
(police sirens blare)

53
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Cop #1:
Freeze!

54
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
Freeze, you motherfucking
cocksucking scumbags!

55
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,200
All right, guys,
stop waving those things...

56
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,300
What took you so fucking long?
Jesus Christ!

57
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,800
It's like 100 degrees in here
and I'm lying in this shit forever.

58
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,200
What the fuck! You guys were late,
we had to go to a Mexican stand-off.

59
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,700
We had to go to gunplay.
Gentlemen, that isn't our racket.

60
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,900
We were busy fighting crime.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You're keeping the streets safe
from pedophiles and drug dealers?

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,500
Oh! Goddamn it.

63
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
I told you, you're using too much powder,
look at my fucking shirt.

64
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,800
I understand,
but you know something?

65
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,600
You don't get
the nice splatter effect.

66
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,800
Look at this splatter effect.

67
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,600
The ones with blood
come out of your cut.

68
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,200
- I can live with that.
- Hey, Jake,

69
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,300
when do I get
to play the inside?

70
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,900
Gordo plays the inside.
You are the shill, you know that.

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,500
Yeah, but come on, all I do
is cry and get insulted here.

72
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,800
What are you talking about?

73
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,100
You should get a fucking Academy Award
for the shill work you do.

74
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,200
Jake: Big Al, does anyone
do it better than you?

75
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,900
Come on, we've got
a good thing going here.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,800
You want to jinx us
by changing things?

77
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,200
Yeah, you're right,
I don't want to jinx anything.

78
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,600
Of course I'm right.
Here you go, that's your cut.

79
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,900
- Thank you.
- Good work, paisan.

80
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,300
- What?
- It's a lot of cash.

81
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,800
He came up with it
awfully quick.

82
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Did you see how quickly
he got out of here?

83
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,800
- He's not coming back, it's over.
- Okay, fine.

84
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,200
I've gotta pinch a loaf.
Did anybody mess up the hoop?

85
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,600
- It's clean.
- Gentlemen,

86
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,800
10%, your cut. Enjoy!

87
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,800
You guys got a lot of sack, man.
I'll give you that much.

88
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,600
It's confidence.
Just confidence.

89
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,600
It doesn't matter what the con is.

90
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,800
Insider trading,
a line we got at a bookie club,

91
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,700
insurance scam, whatever.

92
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,600
You've seen the money
and you want it. More of it.

93
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,000
So who cares if you have
to bend the rules a little bit?

94
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,700
As long as nobody gets hurt.

95
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,600
But then somebody does.

96
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,400
- (gunshot)
- (scream)

97
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,000
Tommy Suits always said,
"A confidence game

98
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,000
is like putting on a play,
where everyone knows their part.

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The inside man, the roper,
the shills,

100
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,000
everyone, that is,
except for the mark."

101
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,500
So now you're
an accomplice in a homicide.

102
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Everything you thought
you were in control of,

103
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,500
just flew out the window,
or is dripping down your leg.

104
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
You should be running out the door,

105
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,800
desperate to forget
that this ever happened,

106
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
and ready to repent
your greedy ways.

107
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,300
What about the money?

108
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,800
Jake:
Then there it is again, that itch.

109
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,500
There's a guy standing in front
of you with a smoking gun,

110
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,000
another guy on the floor
bleeding all over the place,

111
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,400
and all you can do
is think about the money.

112
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,600
You're a sick twisted fuck.

113
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,800
So we gotta make sure
we give you the blow off.

114
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,400
We have to make sure that you never
ever come looking for us again.

115
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,800
We have to get you off
of our backs, forever.

116
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,600
(police sirens blare)

117
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,700
That's why
we give you the fix.

118
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,000
Fuck.

119
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,200
Fuck! Fuck!

120
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
Fuck!

121
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,200
LAPD's finest.

122
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,200
Half as smart
and twice as crooked

123
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
- as the guy they just chased away.
- Freeze! Motherfucking scumbags...

124
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,600
Sucking-fucking cocksuckers!

125
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,400
Man:
Grifters.

126
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
We all can't be
model citizens such as yourself.

127
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,900
- It's all about the money, isn't it?
- Ain't it always?

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,500
Jake:
That's what makes us run.

129
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,100
- What's your name?
- Dutch.

130
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,500
- And despite what they say...
- I love that name.

131
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,900
- Me too.
- It can buy you love.

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,900
Check it out,
original leather seats,

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,100
soft top, and you're gonna
love this, suicide doors.

134
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,300
- Nice!

135
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,700
Jake:
It can say everything about you.

136
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,900
It can erase all those things
about you, you wish didn't exist.

137
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,200
It's Alphonse. I wanna settle up.

138
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,200
No, I haven't been ducking you.

139
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,600
I told you, I get it.

140
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,700
Jake: It can make you think
you're on top of the world.

141
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,000
And if you believe that money
can do all that for you,

142
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,100
you are the perfect mark.

143
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,500
Oops!

144
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,500
Wasn't it Jack Kerouac who said,

145
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,400
"If you own a rug,
you own too much."

146
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,600
I don't necessarily like Kerouac,

147
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,600
and driving cross-country
isn't my idea of a good time,

148
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,600
but the guy's got a point.

149
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,000
(answering machine)
...three messages.

150
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,200
Hey, it's Monica, Bill. I'm still
dizzy from the other night. Call me.

151
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,400
Hi Scott, Just thought I'd call you
and tell you I'm back.

152
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,100
You know the number,
it's Kate, by the way.

153
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,000
Bruce, it's Cheryl, if you don't want to see
me, just say so.

154
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,000
But this is the last time
I'm calling.

155
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,900
Jake: If you've got nothing,
you've got nothing to lose.

156
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,100
But when it comes to money, whether it's
finding it or losing it,

157
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,300
you just have to remember
how much of it is just luck.

158
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,200
Oops!

159
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,800
Jake:
Just dumb fucking luck.

160
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,600
(door slams open)

161
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,400
Mr. Dolby?

162
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,500
Mr. King would like a word with you.

163
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,200
- Now? Right now?
- We have a car waiting.

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,700
(phone ringing)

165
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,000
- Hello.
- You better get over to Al's now.

166
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,800
- For what?
- (dial tone)

167
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
Hello?

168
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,400
Nothing.
Who the fuck?!

169
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,400
There's a couple hundred bucks on
his dresser. All of his shit's here.

170
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,200
This definitely wasn't
a random thing.

171
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,000
Is it ever a random thing?

172
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,400
Shit, Al.
What did you do?

173
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,400
- Let's just think about this...
- Gordo: This fucking town, man.

174
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,900
Jesus Christ,
I had a bad feeling about LA.

175
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,700
Didn't I say that?
This damn fucking town!

176
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
Gordo, now is not
the time for that, all right?

177
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,400
I'm sorry,
I'm just a little...

178
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,700
Jesus Christ. Look at
what they did to him, Jake.

179
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,000
Right in the middle
of his egg foo yung.

180
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,700
Think they know about us?
What if they get to us too?

181
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,700
Don't start
freaking out, okay?

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,800
Let's get Al out of here first.
Miles, get a blanket or something.

183
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,600
No, we're going to
leave him right here.

184
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,500
What are you, high?

185
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,000
We're not leaving Al here.

186
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,300
Gordo: Grab that end, now.
Grab it, Miles!

187
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,500
Jake: Miles, pick up the table
and put it back.

188
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,200
Gordo, let go of the fucking rug.
I said we're leaving him here.

189
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,600
Drop it.

190
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,700
Fuck you! How long have we
worked with this fucking guy?

191
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,700
I'm not going to just fucking
leave him here! All right?

192
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,100
Gordo,
get a fucking grip.

193
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,700
We're leaving him here.

194
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Jake: Big Al used to send
money to his father,

195
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,600
a Vietnam vet slowly losing his mind in a VA
hospital in Cleveland.

196
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,100
- Al was like that.
- Now you coming?

197
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,600
Jake: That's why Al never
played the inside.

198
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,700
There he is.
So what do you hear?

199
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,000
Well, Lionel Dolby came down with a
sudden case of drowning last night.

200
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,500
They just pulled him out
of the Silverlake reservoir.

201
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,700
Now I know why he
was such a good rope.

202
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,600
I mean, cash, that much, and we never had
to put him on the send?

203
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,300
Turns out this fucking mope
is an accountant for the King.

204
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,800
The what? Who's that?

205
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,800
The cash we fleeced off him
was collection money.

206
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,200
Bookies, pushers,
you know, whatever.

207
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,400
He was supposed to take that
money and give it back to the King

208
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,100
earlier yesterday,
like he does every Thursday,

209
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,200
except this time that fucking stenad figured
he could make

210
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,000
a little something off of us and still get the
money back to King

211
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
before anybody says, "Boo."

212
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,600
- Okay, what's a king?
- Currently?

213
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,500
A very large-type pole stuck
right up our asses, Miles.

214
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,900
- Mob?
- No.

215
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,800
No. Independent.

216
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,400
Winston King.

217
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,400
He likes to call
himself "The King."

218
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,100
How'd they get to Al?

219
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,200
It's beautiful.

220
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,800
Last night Al calls some
bookie out in Redondo,

221
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,400
tells them he's got
the cash to settle up.

222
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,800
Because, apparently he's been ducking this
guy for like a month.

223
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Classic fucking Al, right?

224
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,000
So the bookie asks where he's
got this money, all of a sudden.

225
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,400
Does Al tell this guy that he just cashed a
fucking bar mitzvah bond?

226
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,100
That he's been giving head
for 20 bucks a pop? No.

227
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,800
No.

228
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,800
The fucking idiot starts
going on and on about how

229
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,200
this job he just pulled,
how he fleeced Dolby...

230
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,400
how he fleeced...

231
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,600
- You pissed we didn't get credit?
- No, no, no.

232
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,300
That was the only semi-fucking
smart thing he said.

233
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,200
Except, anybody that's
ever met Big Al

234
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,400
knows the only thing he's comfortable
doing alone

235
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,400
is eating.

236
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,700
So this guy tells that guy,
that guy tells some other guy,

237
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,000
eventually it gets back to someone who
works for the King and...

238
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
Shazaam.

239
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Any idea who
the shooter was?

240
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,300
Specifically?
I don't know.

241
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,900
But, I'm sure they're
looking for us, too.

242
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,000
All right, just an idea, let's divvy up the
cash and split.

243
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,800
Excuse me. Are you new?
Is that the thing? Is he new?

244
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,900
Miles, this guy holds a grudge better than
my ex-mother-in-law.

245
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,500
You remember that Moshe Macelli? That
Jew-Italian guy from Boston?

246
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,300
They used to call him Matzo Mazzarelli?
Remember that?

247
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,200
The guy with the face spaz?

248
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,300
It's called a facial twitch, Miles.

249
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,700
And the guy was not
born like that, you know.

250
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,600
Five years ago, Matzo was turf-fixing for
the King at Santa Anita,

251
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,800
and he skimmed two grand
before skipping town.

252
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,800
Five years later King
finally catches up to him,

253
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,400
keeps him chained in his fucking bathroom
for like five days.

254
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,800
Oh, God.

255
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,400
Now just say the word King,
and he spits up all over himself.

256
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,000
- Jesus!
- Pathetic.

257
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,400
Even words like Vi-king and
shrin-king, they set the guy off.

258
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,700
That's a five-year grudge
over $2000.

259
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,000
So we go talk to him.

260
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
You wanna give the money back?

261
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,400
- I didn't say that.
- Pittsburgh.

262
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,400
Madrone.

263
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,200
Pittsburgh is where
it's happening.

264
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,200
Bird flew into my
house last night, too.

265
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,400
Not a good sign, Gordo.

266
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,600
Jake:
The Euclid was our place.

267
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,700
Gordo fleeced the deed off
some jack-off in a card game.

268
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,600
We used it every now and then for
a rag, but mostly it was our office.

269
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
Our power point.

270
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,700
What are you doing?

271
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,600
Where the hell's that going?

272
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,800
- We want insurance?
- Jesus Christ, Miles.

273
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,700
I'm just asking.

274
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,400
Just mail it.

275
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,500
Yeah, I'm looking
for the King, please.

276
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,500
Just tell him it's regarding
an accounting problem.

277
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,400
Yeah, he'll know.

278
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,400
Hollywood and Vine?
Okay.

279
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,700
- When?
- Two hours from now.

280
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,600
- But just me.
- Fuck that. We're going too.

281
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,000
Let's all just put our dicks back in our
pants for a second, okay?

282
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,700
Is this the best
thing to do, Jake?

283
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,400
How do you know the King
is going to let you walk, Jake?

284
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,500
'Cause I'm getting a ride.

285
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,400
Don't be dicking around
in there, okay?

286
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,000
And if he shoots you or stabs you or
causes you to bleed profusely,

287
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,600
call a cab, 'cause your ass
ain't getting back in here.

288
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,100
Thanks, guys.

289
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,300
We appreciate your punctuality.
Mr. King is expecting you.

290
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,500
Lupus!

291
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,500
You said to pat him down,
so I'm patting him down.

292
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,000
It only takes a
moment to be polite.

293
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,100
My apology, Mr. Vig.
If you wouldn't mind?

294
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,800
- So you the guy that got Big Al?
- Nope.

295
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,000
Mr. King farms out
that kind of work. Please.

296
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,500
After you.

297
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Wait with the ladies.

298
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,400
Harlin.

299
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,900
Okay, now you see
that right there?

300
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,700
Find out who she is. Make a note.
I think it's channel 42 or 3.

301
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,000
- A little harder.
- The girls are here and the kid.

302
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,900
Also got the Seldin brothers
with a shipment.

303
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,100
- Bring them in.
- Which?

304
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,300
- Whatever.
- The brothers, the girl or the kid?

305
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,400
Oh that's good. Whoever. Come on. I'm
getting a massage, Harlin.

306
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,000
You got it, boss.

307
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,900
Jake, ladies.

308
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,100
Harlin, I think I bet that dog.

309
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,500
Go! Go! Go!

310
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,700
Hey.

311
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
Well, look it here.

312
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,200
- Hi, girls.
- Girls: Hi.

313
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,100
So, are you two together?

314
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,800
We're sisters.

315
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,900
I like sisters!

316
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,400
Jake, I can't quite see.
Why don't you move a little bit,

317
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,400
so that I can check them out
then you can check them out?

318
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,000
Thanks.

319
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,200
- Sisters, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

320
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,400
- And you're over 18?
- Yeah.

321
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,000
Harlin, let's see
what the sisters can do.

322
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,300
- Put them in the booth.
- Ladies.

323
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,700
Harlin: Oh, by the way,
he had an escort.

324
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,700
LAPD.

325
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,900
That's a little overreacting,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

326
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,500
It's just a little insurance,
that's all.

327
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,600
Uh-huh.
So, they're on the take for you.

328
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,200
Shh. You must be pretty good if
you got cops driving you around.

329
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,300
Is that because
you look so innocent,

330
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,200
and you're kind of cute there
aren't you?

331
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,400
Yeah, it's something like that.

332
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,300
So what do you do, tiger?

333
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,200
You just con people
out of their money?

334
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,800
There is actually
some technique to it.

335
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,600
You mean, like... style.

336
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,900
Yeah, it helps,
don't you think?

337
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,400
No, style is at the end of my list,
I'll tell you why,

338
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,400
when I was a young man like you
just starting out,

339
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,300
my first big score,
this guy we robbed.

340
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,100
I think his name was...
Chinatown Schmidt!

341
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,800
It was nothing big,
my end was about $800.

342
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,400
The first thing I did, I go out
and get myself a suit, right?

343
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,400
Yeah, I looked good.
It was like white.

344
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,500
It was white.
It was white white.

345
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,200
White, white, white, white, white!

346
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,200
Oh, I looked good, man.

347
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,600
I walked down the street,
everybody was checking me out.

348
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,800
- Male and female.
- I'm sure they did.

349
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,700
Anyway, the first day I wore it out,

350
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,100
October, it was still hot out.

351
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,200
We were kicking back in Malibu
and Chinatown Schmidt, right?

352
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,800
He catches up with us, so two guys
roll by and boom, boom, boom, boom!

353
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,800
Boom, boom, boom, boom!

354
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,600
Six of us, scatter, man.
The dust settles.

355
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,600
Everybody's checking
their fingers and their toes.

356
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,000
And who is the one guy
that got hit, sailor?

357
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,600
You know why?

358
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,600
White suit!

359
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,800
I was the first thing they saw,
I was the first thing they aimed at.

360
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,800
I was the first thing they hit.

361
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,300
So what did I learn
that day, Jake?

362
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,300
Don't wear white
after Labor Day, maybe?

363
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,000
No. Sometimes, Jake,

364
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,500
style can get you killed.

365
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Harlin: Mr. King,
the girls are ready!

366
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
Oh great! Wait, sport,
you're gonna love this.

367
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,500
- You ever been here before?
- No, it's not really my thing.

368
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,500
Oh, you don't know that.
Tuesday we got Disco Night,

369
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,400
Wednesday is that
electronic music shit,

370
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,800
Thursdays are
Gay and Lesbian Night.

371
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,200
That is very tasteful, by the way.
Ow! Ow! Ow!

372
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,400
Lupus, I want you
to get me... Lupus!

373
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,000
Goddamn it, you're looking at them
or you're working for me?

374
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,600
I want you to get me an espresso,
please, and tell that bitch

375
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,700
to give me back my slippy dips.
Come on. Now!

376
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,800
Let me ask you something,
why one of my guys?

377
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,400
Why Lionel Dolby?

378
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,800
My six-year-old nephew could con
anything out of that dude. Why?

379
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,000
Look, if we knew Dolby
was connected to you,

380
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,100
we'd never have gone near him, so
I apologize for any inconvenience.

381
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,400
Honest mistake,
all right?

382
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,500
It's just something between two guys
that don't know each other yet.

383
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
So we're gonna make
an exchange of the money

384
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,800
and all will be forgiven.
Isn't that right?

385
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,300
- No. That I won't do.
- Won't?

386
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,700
You won't.
You won't.

387
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,400
I want you to look very hard at me,
motherfucker, and tell me why.

388
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,800
Let me rephrase that.
That I can't do.

389
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,000
Because A, I don't have the money,
and B, you killed one of my guys.

390
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,200
One of your guys.
That's four-spot, right?

391
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,200
- Yeah.
- Four.

392
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,400
One of your guys, huh?

393
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
I gotta take a pill,
or I'm all over the place.

394
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,400
- This is confidential, right?
- Yeah.

395
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,800
Mm! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

396
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,300
Hey, stop it!
Stop that right now!

397
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,000
They can't hear me. Harlin,
get them outta there, Goddamn it.

398
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,700
Down! Down! Shit, man.

399
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,700
How do you like that?
They're sisters.

400
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,100
Let me ask you something.
I want a straight answer now.

401
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,000
You did not know
that Dolby was connected to me?

402
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,400
- You heard me before.
- But it's so important

403
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,300
that you don't stray from the truth
in this one little part.

404
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,700
I didn't know.

405
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,100
You're a good grifter, man.

406
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,900
It's hard to tell when you're lying.

407
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,700
But I'm getting there.
Come here, girls.

408
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,200
Now listen, it's the first time
I've ever put girls in the booth.

409
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,800
Usually, they work their way up.

410
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,400
You're gonna go work on your routine,
you know why?

411
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,400
Because you're saying
that you are sisters.

412
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,000
- Mm-mm, We are sisters.
- Shh.

413
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,000
- We're very close.
- Let me talk. Let me talk.

414
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,600
- You don't like what we're doing?
- Of course I like what you're doing

415
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,200
but I like it done
with artistry, with grace,

416
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
and that means,
if you're gonna eat each other,

417
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,600
you must find a way
to do it tastefully, okay?

418
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,200
These are people here,
they've got families, all right?

419
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,600
- Okay.
- You understand? Then go work!

420
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,300
- Go on. Go on!
- Ladies.

421
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,200
Tell me this,

422
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
how are you and I
gonna resolve our shit?

423
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,200
I get you what I owe you,

424
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,900
plus interest,
by going on the grift for you.

425
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,400
I like that. Okay, sit down.
Put your baby cakes down here,

426
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,400
that cute little
Irish muscle ass you got.

427
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,000
Look, I came here
to do a deal,

428
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,900
not play grab-ass with you,
you freak, all right?

429
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,300
- Humor.
- You heard my proposal

430
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,700
- Humor, Jake, junior,
buster, humor. Come on.

431
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,600
You wanna get out of here
I gotta open up the place.

432
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,300
Come on, sit down.
Business. Come on.

433
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,000
All right. Here's what l...

434
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,100
- you don't want to sit closer?
- No, I'm fine over here, thank you.

435
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,200
All right.

436
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,000
Can I see your hand?

437
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,500
You got a big hand. Let me see
your hand, I'm not gonna bite you.

438
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,800
Look at that hand, man.
You should have been a pianist,

439
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,700
or a guitarist,
look at the size of that.

440
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,000
Wow. See this?

441
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,900
That's your love line.
That's your money line.

442
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,700
And that's looking very very good.

443
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,000
And that's your life line,
going all the way down...

444
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,100
Uh-oh.

445
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,000
You see that little gap there.

446
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,100
It means that at one point
you could have a little trouble.

447
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,300
But it's up to you
to make it better.

448
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,400
I want you to talk to me
and I want you to make me happy.

449
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,600
And I don't want you to scare me.

450
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,700
You do not want to scare me, junior.

451
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,700
What's gonna happen, now?

452
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,000
I play a con.
You get a cut, I get a cut.

453
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,400
We get square.

454
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,900
And I give you the who
and you give me the how, right?

455
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And you can
because you're so good, right?

456
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,600
I like to think so.

457
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,200
Okay, you're gonna do this
with Morgan Price.

458
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,700
- Morgan Price?
- Yes.

459
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,800
- Impossible.
- Why?

460
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,700
'Cause you can't get to him.
He's too big.

461
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,900
You got to me.

462
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,100
- Yeah, but we got to you because...
- What?

463
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,000
- You were a fluke, a mistake.

464
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,400
That's a good answer.

465
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,400
- Why Morgan Price?
- 'Cause he's very important to me.

466
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,600
Lupus!

467
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,400
Don't fuck with me, junior,
okay? Lupus!

468
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,600
You know what?

469
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,800
You're gonna take
my friend Lupus with you, okay?

470
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,200
Absolutely not,
that's not the way I operate.

471
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,100
- Shh.
- I work with my guys.

472
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,000
You're gonna take Lupus with you.

473
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,000
That's the way I operate.

474
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,800
Look at me, now.
Tell me we're set.

475
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
- Yeah. We're set.
- Good.

476
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,600
We're done
with all this business now?

477
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,300
The rest of it
depends on you.

478
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,000
I think I'm done.

479
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,900
* Erotica *

480
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,800
* Romance *

481
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,900
* Erotica *

482
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,900
* Romance *

483
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,900
* My name is Dita *

484
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,800
* I'll be your mistress tonight *

485
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,100
* I'd like to put you
in a trance... *

486
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,900
Excuse me, miss? Miss!

487
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,900
I think you dropped something.

488
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,000
You know you're good,
but you're not that good.

489
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,900
I spotted that lift
from across the club.

490
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,000
Wait?
You don't recognize me?

491
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,500
- Tony, could you get my car?
- Sure!

492
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,800
You really don't remember me,
do you?

493
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,100
Should I?

494
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,400
Oh, right.

495
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,500
That's good.

496
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,200
So, you're interested
in a little work?

497
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,300
You couldn't afford me.

498
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,600
Not with $27

499
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,100
and a maxed-out Visa, John.

500
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,400
Or is it Tom or Bill?

501
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,300
Hard to tell
with so many IDs.

502
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
Yeah, well, the name's Jake.

503
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,600
And don't flatter yourself, sweetheart.

504
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,600
That's one thing
I never had to pay for,

505
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,600
and I don't consider it work.

506
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,100
Guess you got
the wrong girl then.

507
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:58,100
Do me a favor,
take a deep breath and count to 10.

508
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,300
I'm talking about a grift,
and it pays well.

509
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,300
Unless you think
you're gonna get rich

510
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,300
jerking off geriatrics
in that place.

511
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,200
I didn't know you cared.

512
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,500
Keep the wallet.

513
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,500
We're even.

514
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,500
Take a deep breath,

515
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,600
count to 10, and...

516
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,300
go fuck yourself!

517
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,700
Look, it pays well.

518
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
Six figures.

519
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,800
All you gotta do
is play a part,

520
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,400
do a little acting.

521
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,400
You think
you can handle that?

522
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,900
Why me?
You don't even know me.

523
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,600
'Cause what I've seen, I liked.

524
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,800
And I got
a good feeling about you.

525
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,300
Hasn't anyone ever
said that to you before?

526
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,700
No.

527
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,800
- Thanks, Tony.
- You bet!

528
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,900
But, I'll think about it.

529
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,200
All right, I think
it will be worth your while.

530
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,400
Make a wish.

531
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,500
11:11, make a wish.

532
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,200
That's twice!

533
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,200
- I can see why you liked her.
- Yeah, I liked her a lot.

534
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,500
And that was it, we had our crew.

535
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,200
Now all we needed was the con.

536
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,400
Miles:
Bottoms. Oh...

537
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,800
- Oh well.
- Shit!

538
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,000
What's up, guys?

539
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,200
Who's the mope?

540
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,200
This is Lupus.

541
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,600
He works with the King and now
he's gonna be part of our crew.

542
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,900
I'm here to make sure
things go smoothly.

543
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,700
Woman:
Anybody got a light?

544
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,300
And this is Lily.

545
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,200
She's the new shill
I was telling you about.

546
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,400
- Whoa.
- Gordo: Whoa, whoa, whoa...

547
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,700
Hold the fucking phone,
what is this?

548
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,700
Are we playing a con, or are we doing a
rendition of "Our Town"?

549
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,300
Gordo, trust me.
We need the help on this one.

550
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,200
Our new mark?
Morgan Price.

551
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,500
Why?

552
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,600
Because, that's who the King
wants us to fleece.

553
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,000
And besides,
the price is perfect.

554
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,600
I'm not supposed to wait for you,
you're supposed to wait for me.

555
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,600
Jake: His old man
was a big time mob attorney.

556
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,800
Which makes him
a second generation crook.

557
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,800
When he dropped dead, Price
carried on the family tradition,

558
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,100
by opening a one-stop shopping center for
money laundering

559
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,200
and low interest corporate fraud.

560
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,200
Well, fuck him!

561
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,200
Almost $1 billion gets washed
through his shop every year,

562
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,700
so we know
he's got the money.

563
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,500
It's just a matter
of getting to it.

564
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,900
How much
are we going after?

565
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,200
$5 million.

566
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,100
- We can only hold the King at 150.
- I know.

567
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,000
That's why we don't go
after him directly.

568
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,500
First, we find a doable mark
in Price's bank,

569
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,500
a mid-level employee.

570
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,600
We meet him with papers,
inquiring about a corporate loan.

571
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,200
Our guy then fudges numbers
in the right places.

572
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,200
Moves our papers to the top
of the pile or to the bottom,

573
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,600
depending upon what we need.

574
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,400
Our loan is approved.

575
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,100
On the given day,

576
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,400
the money's wired into a corporate
account in an offshore bank.

577
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,200
That same day, I show up
in Belize with the proper ID,

578
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,700
and corporate papers
to make the withdrawal.

579
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,200
- Um-mm.
- What? What is it, Miles?

580
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,100
I'm just thinking
out loud here...

581
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,600
but $5 million
in a briefcase?

582
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,400
Good point.

583
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,600
Jake: It's bank policy not
to release this money in cash,

584
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,800
'cause it's under
a corporate account.

585
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,600
So we then cash the check
at another bank.

586
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,200
Any major airport's
gonna be too hard to control.

587
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,100
LAX is out.
So we use Ontario.

588
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,400
Mid-level hub
with direct international flights.

589
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,600
40 minutes outside LA.
This is the most important part,

590
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,200
you can't just walk
into the United States

591
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,600
with a suitcase full of cash,

592
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,400
without evoking the words
"cavity search."

593
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,000
That's why we need someone
on the inside at Customs.

594
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,900
Then we disappear.

595
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,200
Now this might just be me,
but that is hands down

596
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,400
the dumbest fucking idea
I've ever heard.

597
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,500
Gordo:
People have tried this before, Jake.

598
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,100
It's never worked.

599
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,000
Teddy Fraiser and his crew
got nailed in Vancouver last year.

600
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
It's never worked before,

601
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,800
because, A,
they didn't flush the bank enough,

602
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,000
B, their corporate papers
were for shit,

603
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,700
and C, unlike us,

604
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,700
they did not have somebody
on the inside at Customs.

605
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,000
Yeah, or D,
it's a dumb fucking idea!

606
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,200
Hey!

607
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,500
What do you fucking suggest,
Miles? You wanna run?

608
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,300
We never had
a problem with that, before.

609
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,600
Jake: We never had
a fucking problem like this before.

610
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,200
Yes, we have, okay?

611
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,800
And we would have been
beautiful about it.

612
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,800
We would have had
a bucket of fried chicken,

613
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,200
delivered to the King with a nice

614
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,300
Kiss My Ass card attached to it,
and we would have moved on

615
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,700
until the next
local putz caught on.

616
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,500
We're getting
too old to run, Miles.

617
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,400
Yeah well, we're still
a little too young for San Quentin.

618
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,800
Look, I'm... I mean,
are you pissed off about Al?

619
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,800
Look at me.

620
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,000
Trust me, I'm pissed too.

621
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,600
But I'm not 25-to-life pissed.

622
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,700
Look, I'm getting clear of this.

623
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,700
All right?

624
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,900
So if you don't want to do it
for the fucking principle,

625
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,200
do it for the money.
Gordo?

626
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,900
Yeah, Jake, whatever.

627
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,700
There's no whatever with this one.

628
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,100
You're either with me
or against me.

629
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,000
No third position.

630
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,700
I'm in.

631
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,100
Aw, what a relief.

632
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,400
Oh, fuck.

633
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,300
Jake:
I agreed with Miles,

634
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,200
it was hands down,
a dumb fucking idea.

635
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,800
But they bought in,
now I had to deliver...

636
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,200
- Yeah, it's Vig.
- And I needed help.

637
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,600
Cop #1: What are we gonna do
with this stuff? I mean, heroin.

638
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,800
- What do you do with heroin?
- You sell it.

639
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,400
- To who?
- Don't be a knucklehead.

640
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,900
Cop #2: How hard do you think it is
to sell one drug dealer's drugs

641
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,900
to another drug dealer?

642
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,400
If Vig is right,
we're looking at 100, 150.

643
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,100
You think it's a good idea?
We never done this shit before.

644
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,500
Well, what is he gonna do,
file a missing drug report?

645
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,600
Hey if it works out, we could turn the guy
over a few times.

646
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,400
I hope so, bro'. I took my daughter
to the orthodontist, yesterday.

647
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,300
150 bucks to tighten
those bitches up.

648
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,300
Took him five minutes.
Then he said it wasn't even covered.

649
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,300
It's cosmetic.
The plan doesn't cover cosmetic.

650
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,200
I had a cap put in here, right?

651
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,400
My fucking dentist tells me,
"You're not covered for that."

652
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,700
Bullshit cosmetics!

653
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,700
I got a freaking tooth
split in half here, all right?

654
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,800
Write that shit in
as a cavity or something.

655
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,300
- Did he?
- Yeah, he did.

656
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,800
Fucking department
got the bullshit dental plan.

657
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,800
That's our man, right there.
Red bag, right?

658
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,400
- Is that the guy?
- Let's go.

659
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,400
Hands up!
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

660
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,800
- What the fuck you got?
- Get on the ground.

661
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,800
- So, how did you get caught?

662
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,100
Tommy Suits used to say
that in any con,

663
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,800
sooner or later somebody's gonna
start asking the right questions.

664
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,600
Usually, it takes a little longer.

665
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,700
Gordo: Am I the only one who feels like we
can't make a move,

666
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,200
with this guy on us?
I think we should ditch him.

667
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,400
Jake: No, we need him and dummy up.
Here he comes.

668
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,000
Gordo:
Ah, here he is. Hey, hey.

669
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,600
How's the hoop, superstar? Clean?

670
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,200
What the fuck is it with you
and bathrooms, huh? Tell me.

671
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,700
Miles: Hey, he can't use a restroom
unless he knows it's clean.

672
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,400
- What's the matter with that?
- Manly, all right, wise guy?

673
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,300
That's cute.

674
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,700
You know this is
a major metropolitan city, brother.

675
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,900
Public sanitation
does not run very high

676
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,800
on the City Hall agenda.

677
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,700
You know what you can get
off a toilet seat or a doorknob?

678
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,400
You wanna run down the list?

679
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,300
Hepatitis.
You ever hear of that?

680
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,700
Influenza.
The fucking flesh-eating disease.

681
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,400
- I'm eating.
- Yeah, we noticed.

682
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,300
Do you need a shovel
down there, dear?

683
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,500
Gordo, Gordo.
That's enough, all right?

684
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,700
We gotta get down
to business, here. Miles!

685
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,600
We're gonna need you to find us
a mark inside of Price's bank.

686
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,500
Somebody we can work with.
Gordo, we're gonna need papers.

687
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,000
Corporate insurance,
a letter of intent, the whole nine.

688
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,500
- All fugazze?
- No, no, no

689
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,500
Corporate papers
have got to be legit.

690
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,800
We're all gonna need new IDs.
You gotta make sure they're clean.

691
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,700
Go talk to Suits,
and he'll hook you up.

692
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,200
- What about Customs?
- Don't worry about Customs,

693
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,600
I'll take care of that.

694
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,600
We're gonna need
some start-up cash, first.

695
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,500
Lupus, you think the King
would be willing to bank us?

696
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,400
You already owe him.

697
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,800
Lupus,
we need a banker for this.

698
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,600
We can't do this job
without a banker.

699
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,500
- Gordo, do we need a banker?
- I think so, yes.

700
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,500
- Jake: I think we need a banker.
- I don't know, man

701
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,800
- You could try.
- He's not gonna listen to me.

702
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,200
I bet if you talk to him,
loosen him up,

703
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,900
- maybe he'll listen to you.
- All right! I'll try, okay?

704
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,800
Don't do us any favors,
all right?

705
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,800
Jesus, join the team!

706
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,600
So, you guys are good?
You know what you need to do?

707
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,000
- Yeah.
- All right!

708
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,200
Lupus, Lily, we'll go over
to see the King, now.

709
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,400
- All right!
- Jake: Ready to roll?

710
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,400
Let's do it.

711
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,200
I'm not finished.

712
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,200
She's not finished.

713
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,200
Gordo: What's wrong with you?
Where's your manners?

714
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,800
Nice!
You know why?

715
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,700
Because it's real.
You're licking each other.

716
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,200
- Feels good?
- Feels so good.

717
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,000
All right, that's it...
what? What, what?

718
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,000
Jake is here,

719
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,100
He wants you to stake him
a couple hundred grand.

720
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,100
No, he's supposed to be getting me
money, not costing me money.

721
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,200
He says we need it.
And I gotta say, boss,

722
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,600
- this guy's pretty sharp, you know?
- Look at me, look at me.

723
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,600
- You're getting a crush on him?
- What are you talking about?

724
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,400
Don't let him get into your head, 'cause
he's a charmer.

725
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,000
You tell him to wait a minute
and then you bring him in.

726
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,000
He's right behind you.

727
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,200
Get outta here.
Get outta here.

728
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,700
You're starting
to scare me, sport. Harlin!

729
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,700
200K?
Isn't that more than you owe me?

730
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,700
Jake: You're just gonna have
to trust me on this, all right?

731
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,300
Oh, no.
You're a day late on trust.

732
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,400
I think that what he's trying
to say is that he'Il...

733
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,100
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

734
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,900
You brought her for a reason,
didn't you, booster?

735
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,800
Let's listen to her.

736
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,800
No, why don't you listen up?

737
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,200
Even though I'm running
the show for you,

738
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,000
I'm still running the show.

739
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,300
So we're gonna put an end to

740
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,900
the scooter- junior-skippy-sport-
tiger-booster bullshit.

741
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,800
The name is Jake.

742
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,200
What do you say you get
the ADD under control?

743
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,200
You look me in the eye
when I'm talking to you.

744
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,800
- What's your name, honey?
- Her name is Lily.

745
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,700
Booster, have I ever
referred to you as honey?

746
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,200
Have I, scooter?

747
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,900
It's a common mistake that Jake
is making when he says ADD.

748
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,300
What he really means is ADHD,

749
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,800
for Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder, see?

750
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,400
The important word is the H,

751
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,200
Hyperactivity.
I don't understand,

752
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,600
why do you let her do that
if you care about her?

753
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,400
It's poison, see?

754
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,600
Feel my heart.

755
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,800
Go ahead. I bet it beats
twice as fast as yours.

756
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,800
- Go on feel it.
- I'm fine, thanks.

757
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,100
Oh, come on. Will you feel my heart?
I'm not gonna bite you.

758
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,000
God, you feel good.

759
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,000
Like a trip-hammer, right?

760
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,600
See? Much faster...

761
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,400
than yours.

762
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,900
Why am I enjoying this

763
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,100
so much, Jake?

764
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,500
Because

765
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,600
I feel like she is

766
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,900
too.

767
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,300
I'm sorry,
I know that was tasteless, dear.

768
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,800
I was just trying
to make a point to Jake, okay?

769
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,300
What do you say you get
your ADD under control,

770
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,600
and we get to the fucking point?

771
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,700
Ooh, I think Jake is referring
to my medication,

772
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,600
which I thought was confidential.

773
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:12,200
Jacob, come on, come on.

774
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,000
You know why I take that stuff.

775
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,000
Because if I don't, I become hyper,

776
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
or primitive, right?
Or impulsive.

777
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,200
You never know when
I'm going to lose it.

778
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,200
Now listen to me, okay?

779
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,300
Hey!

780
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,600
I'm not a violent man.

781
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,000
I like to think
I am above that, right?

782
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,800
You took my money
and now you're asking for more.

783
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,600
And I'm gonna give you... I'm gonna
give you what you're asking for,

784
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,100
- which is, how much? Tell me again.
- 200.

785
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,600
200, how much is that altogether?

786
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:48,000
Including what you took
from me the first time?

787
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,900
350.

788
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,200
Oh, that's very good,
you're smart, aren't you?

789
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,000
You told me you were smart.
You're a smart, smart, smart guy!

790
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,900
So be smarter, huh?

791
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,400
Don't get hurt.
Don't scare me.

792
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,800
You've got a good, healthy,
long life ahead of you.

793
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,700
I like you,
now say, "We're set."

794
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,100
- "We're set."
- Say it like you like me too.

795
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,500
Come on, you can do it.

796
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,400
Say, "we're set"
like you like me.

797
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,300
We're set.

798
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,000
Okay, now I want you
to take your lovely,

799
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,000
lovely lady home.

800
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,800
Oh my God,
you're beautiful.

801
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,900
Let's go.

802
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,600
Don't you ever, ever

803
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,500
let anyone stand behind me,
without me knowing.

804
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,400
You hear me?
You understand me?

805
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,300
Man: So the King
gave you the money.

806
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,400
Jake: Now, we just needed
to find our guy in Price's bank.

807
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,000
Jake: What you're looking for
in a mark

808
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,500
is someone whose weaknesses
you can exploit.

809
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,600
Michelle Strigo, loan officer.

810
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,600
Jake: Guy like me,
people like that,

811
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,100
I tell you what you're looking for
without even meeting you.

812
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,400
(woman screams)

813
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,700
You fucking asshole!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

814
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,700
You cocksucker!

815
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,200
Jake: It's like a personal ad
you wear over your head.

816
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,400
- She's not gonna work.
- You sure?

817
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,600
Jay Housler,
VP of international finance.

818
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,200
No.

819
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,600
Leon Ashby,
VP of corporate loans.

820
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,900
What you're looking for in a mark
is someone who has nothing to lose.

821
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,800
No friends. No family. No life.

822
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,300
You're looking for a guy
who doesn't own a rug.

823
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,200
Jake:
Oh yeah, he's perfect.

824
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,000
- Miles: You sure?
- Hey, I'm sure.

825
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,000
Ashby was the right mark.

826
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,300
Now I needed to see if Lily was
the right shill, so I tested her.

827
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,000
One watch engraved,
"To Carolyn,

828
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,200
Happy Graduation Counselor,
Love, Mom and Dad."

829
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,200
- Good.
- One bracelet engraved,

830
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,800
"To Annie,
Happy 25th Anniversary, Love, Tom."

831
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,500
- Perfect!
- I'll be right back, Mr. Lewis.

832
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,800
- Okay, thank you.

833
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,700
Excuse me, I think you have
something on hold for me.

834
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,900
- Do you have a ticket?
- I lost it but the name is Hanson.

835
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,400
- Okay
- Thanks a lot.

836
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,000
- Mr. Lewis, right?
- Yes?

837
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,600
- Jake Hanson. I go to Law School
with your daughter Carolyn.

838
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:30,200
- We met a couple of times, before.
- Oh, of course, Jake!

839
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,800
- It's good to see you again.
- Good to see you too.

840
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,200
You remember... Lily!

841
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,600
This beautiful woman is my wife.

842
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,800
Lily, this is Carolyn's father.

843
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,700
- Oh, nice to meet you.
- Pleasure, I'm sure.

844
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,700
So, what brings you down
from Stanford?

845
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,800
Taking advantage of
the long weekend?

846
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,700
- Yeah, we're...
- It's our first anniversary!

847
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,000
Congratulations!
That's great.

848
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,900
Carolyn is down
for the weekend too.

849
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
- Really?
- Mm-mm, yeah.

850
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,100
Maybe you can
do me a favor then.

851
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,500
We split the cost on a couple
of books, last semester,

852
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,900
and I never got an opportunity
to pay her back,

853
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,700
- I'll just write you a check.
- There's nothing for Hanson.

854
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,600
If we had a ticket,
I could check the computer.

855
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,700
But yesterday, my wallet

856
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,100
and my wife's purse were stolen,
and the ticket was in my wallet.

857
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,400
Maybe, you could check again.

858
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,600
Jesus, where did this happen?

859
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,200
We're staying at the Peninsula,

860
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,600
I think it might have been
the housekeeping staff.

861
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,100
But Jake has a little more faith
in humanity than I do.

862
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,700
He hates me saying it,
but I think it's true.

863
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,800
You have to be so careful
these days.

864
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,300
You sure do.

865
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,200
Honey,
I'm just gonna go

866
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,400
and pick out a wallet.
It was nice to meet you.

867
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,400
- Nice to meet you.
- There you are Mr. Lewis.

868
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,300
- Good.
- I'm sorry, sir, still nothing.

869
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,400
- May I ask what it was?
- It's a shame, it was

870
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,400
a pair of...
a pair of diamond earrings.

871
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,300
Actually,
it's just like those.

872
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,400
- We have those in stock.
- Oh great.

873
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,600
- Let me write you a check
- Only with the proper ID.

874
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,000
Yeah, I understand that but
like I just explained to you,

875
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,800
my wallet was...

876
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,200
this is sort of a very special day for my
wife and I,

877
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,100
it being our first anniversary.

878
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,600
She thinks we're here to pick up
something for my mother,

879
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:15,500
but I wanted to surprise her
with something special.

880
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,800
So if you think you can
make an exception today,

881
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,900
- just this one time.
- I'm sorry.

882
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,900
Thank you.

883
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,200
Please, tell Carolyn I said hello
and pass the note for her.

884
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,500
- I sure will.
- It was good to see you again.

885
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,000
Good to see you.

886
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,500
Look, Jake,

887
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,900
why don't you
write me a check,

888
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,600
and let me put the earrings
on my credit card?

889
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,300
Is that all right with you?

890
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,300
If you'd be willing to do that,
that would be great.

891
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,900
Good. Please.

892
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,400
- Mr. Lewis, thanks again.
- You bet, Jake.

893
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,000
Happy Anniversary.

894
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,100
All right? Now that's how
you pull a con.

895
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,600
So smile like you just got a present
from the man of your dreams.

896
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,600
Thank you!

897
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,000
You're welcome, now let's give it
a strong finish, all right?

898
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,300
He's gone.

899
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,800
- Oh yeah.
- I gotta go get a haircut.

900
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,900
Hey, how you doing?

901
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,800
Hey guys,
good to see you, man.

902
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,800
What's up, boss?

903
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,800
- Right here.
- That's good.

904
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,800
- What are you having?
- I'm gonna go light,

905
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,900
I'm gonna get the chicken
and rib combo.

906
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,400
That's light?

907
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,300
Yeah,
I'm not getting the coleslaw.

908
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,500
So, what's good here?

909
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:08,600
- Who the fuck are you?
- Special Agent Gunther Butan.

910
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,000
- Special agent?
- I'm looking for Jake Vig.

911
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,500
- Who?
- Who? The invisible man.

912
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,900
The specter,
the spook, the ghost.

913
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,800
But then the other day,
like a gift,

914
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,200
a buddy of his,
a crew member,

915
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,100
Alphonse Moorely...

916
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,400
you know Alphonse Moorely.
He wakes up with a hole in his head.

917
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,900
Look, Special Agent...
what's your name?

918
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,200
- Butan!
- I got a pretty good sense of humor

919
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,200
- like most people.
- Really, you've a sense of humor?

920
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,500
- Yeah, I do. So if this is
some kind of a fucking joke,

921
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,300
- I'm not into this shit!
- A joke?!

922
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,300
A couple of years ago,
I'm working undercover on a case

923
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,600
that Jake Vig is involved with.
He's running some sort of scam

924
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,900
importing merchandise
for some guy in Tampa.

925
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:49,400
And I got close,
real close, and he knew it.

926
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,400
In order to let me know,
and to rub it in,

927
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,900
he sent me this tie. Since then,
I've been following him,

928
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
from Chicago to Denver
to Salt Lake City,

929
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,600
to Phoenix and I've been
wearing this tie ever since,

930
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,600
because it keeps me motivated.

931
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:03,400
That's a real nice tie. I don't know if it
says, "Special Agent."

932
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,600
You know what it says?
It says,

933
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,600
"You can't catch me,
so fuck you. So fuck you."

934
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,400
- And fuck you!
- Hey!

935
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,500
Temper's a sign of weakness.
Temper's a sign of weakness.

936
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,400
Hey man, can we get you
a glass of water?

937
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,200
I'm working at this
temper management issue.

938
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,300
My doc says
I should stay calm,

939
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,800
because I might do
or say something

940
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,500
- that I might regret later.
- Look, Special Agent...

941
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:33,400
- sell one drug dealer's drugs
to another drug dealer?

942
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,300
Hey, hey,
can you put that away?

943
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,400
- Wow!
- Hey, hey, hey...

944
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,800
Butan: Let's take a walk.
Let's go for a walk.

945
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,800
Now here is the deal...

946
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,600
You guys are gonna help me catch
Jake Vig. Whatever he's into next,

947
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:49,300
you guys are gonna be into.
And whatever you're into, I'm into.

948
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,900
This fucking gun
is killing my back.

949
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,900
In exchange, I'm gonna make sure you
guys are cleared

950
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,400
of any past associations with Vig

951
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,500
as part of a
cross-departmental investigation,

952
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,400
and that home movie I got,
I'll make sure

953
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,400
that it doesn't move its way
into Internal Affairs.

954
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,400
Who knows? This prick
has been on the wish list so long,

955
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,100
you two guys,
might even get a promotion.

956
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,400
What the fuck
are you getting out of all this?

957
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,800
Peace of mind.

958
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,500
I might even get a chance
to get rid of this fucking tie!

959
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,100
Why are you looking at me
that way, Lloyd?

960
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,900
Not everybody is on the take.

961
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,600
If you Feds are so hot
for this guy,

962
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,900
why don't you just let us go out?
We'll bring him in, that's it.

963
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,300
A fox isn't a fox until
he's caught in the henhouse.

964
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,800
- Oh nice. What is that, an analogy?
- A metaphor.

965
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:31,000
Actually, it's neither
but it is a good deal.

966
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,100
You guys go clean,
I get peace of mind,

967
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,500
and better yet, Lloyd's daughter
gets to keep her braces,

968
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,400
and have that winning smile,
just like her daddy.

969
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,200
One more thing,

970
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,800
you guys can't be running around
with heroin in your car.

971
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,200
Jake: Let me tell you
something about Butan.

972
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,100
He's just as crooked
as the next guy.

973
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,700
You'd think he'd have something
better to do with taxpayer dollars.

974
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,700
Well, cue the fucking violins.

975
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,600
Come on, man,
it's getting cold out here.

976
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,200
Jake: It was all in play.
Everything!

977
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,100
And with a little luck,
we're about to land the mark.

978
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,700
- Where the hell is she?
- I have no idea.

979
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,800
- She's 10 minutes late.
- Jake: Luck's a funny thing.

980
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,000
- Especially the bad.
- She's nice.

981
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,300
Black cats, breaking a mirror,

982
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,600
- breathe on a match.
- (doorbell rings)

983
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,000
- It's about time.
- Believe it.

984
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:27,400
Believe it all. But if you really want to talk
about bad luck,

985
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,200
redheads.

986
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,600
You have got to be
fucking kidding me.

987
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:33,900
Shit.

988
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,300
Top three all time worst redheads:

989
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,400
Lizzie Borden, axe murderer;

990
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,800
Judas, betrayer;

991
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,800
Shirley Vig,

992
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,300
abandoner.

993
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,600
Nice to see you too.

994
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,800
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

995
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,000
Any idea?

996
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,000
What is with the hair?

997
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,700
What?
You told me to change it.

998
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,400
Jake: But the fucking
grand poohbah of all jinxes,

999
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,400
a bird in your house.

1000
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,600
A bird enters your house,
it means death.

1001
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,300
What about this then? What's with the scarf
with the birds?

1002
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,100
I mean, do you know what that means?
Do you know what that means?

1003
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,500
You have just put
a mother of a jinx on us.

1004
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:22,500
- Gordo, can you believe this?
- Gordo: Oy vey.

1005
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,400
We're dead.
We're dead.

1006
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,700
Did I miss something, guys?

1007
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,000
Sweetheart, it's the red hair.
It's bad luck.

1008
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,400
Miles: It's not like she's
a real redhead, Jake.

1009
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,600
Look, it doesn't
matter, all right?

1010
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,500
You can't fool bad luck,
you can't get by on a technicality.

1011
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,800
You can't trick karma.

1012
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,900
You just fucked us.

1013
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,800
So much for that
good feeling, huh?

1014
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,600
That's what I get for putting
a chick on the team, right?

1015
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,900
Gordo.
Burn that.

1016
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,900
Lupus! Think fast.
Lily, hold on a second, will you?

1017
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,400
Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?

1018
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:13,800
- No. Please.
- Thanks.

1019
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,000
Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry
I'm late, but I'm not that late.

1020
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,300
You didn't have to
give away my seat.

1021
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,100
I didn't know
you were coming.

1022
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,700
- I didn't know. Sorry.
- No problem.

1023
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:31,900
Thanks for playing along.
I had to sit down for awhile.

1024
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,700
- Tough day?
- Brutal day.

1025
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,500
- What are you drinking?
- Maker's Mark, on the rocks.

1026
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,000
- His rocks, mine straight up.
- You got it.

1027
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,200
My name is Leon,
Leon Ashby.

1028
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,500
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
I'm overbearing and rude.

1029
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,600
Lily.
Lily Finn.

1030
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:58,200
- So what do you do?
- It's more like, what don't I do?

1031
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,200
It's a long story.

1032
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:04,000
Well, we're getting drinks.
What happened?

1033
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,200
My partners and I are trying
to secure start-up capital

1034
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,400
for a small tech company.

1035
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,300
We tried the venture
capitalist route,

1036
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,200
but since the bubble
burst on dot coms...

1037
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,600
You're a few years off the mark.
A lot of bubbles were burst.

1038
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,500
Yeah.

1039
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,300
Optimists that we are,
we thought we'd try our luck

1040
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,900
with a straight corporate loan.

1041
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,100
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1042
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,400
- Oh, no, no, I can get this.
- On me. For the seat.

1043
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,200
Chin-chin.

1044
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,400
So we've been meeting
with banks all day.

1045
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,600
It's amazing how many
ways they can say no

1046
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,600
without ever actually
saying the word.

1047
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Typically, a corporate loan
is a fairly simple matter.

1048
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,300
But you do have to demonstrate
a capacity for gross fund recovery.

1049
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,700
Let me guess,

1050
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,100
your bubble didn't burst.

1051
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,800
No, no, nothing like that.
I work in a bank.

1052
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,900
Really?

1053
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,500
I wish we'd met eight hours ago.

1054
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,800
Good evening, gentlemen.

1055
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,700
Oh, my partners are here.

1056
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,400
We have dinner plans.

1057
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,100
Oh, well, uh...

1058
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,600
- thank you for the drink.
- Oh, you're welcome.

1059
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:32,400
I was just going to ask
if you'd like to join us.

1060
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,700
- Sure.
- Okay.

1061
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,700
Jake: So she got one leg out from
under him, now we had to lean.

1062
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,500
So then Miles, God bless him,
he walks right into

1063
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,900
the fucking Creative Director's office and
he says,

1064
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,300
"I'm sorry this
program is for shit."

1065
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,500
No, no. And then he throws
like a thousand pages of code

1066
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,400
- all over the fucking guy's office!
- Jake: This is our boss, all right?

1067
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,700
So he kicks Miles and I out of the office,
he's screaming and yelling,

1068
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,700
"You're fired. Your whole
fucking team is fired."

1069
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,200
Now he's looking for Lily,
he's looking for Lupus,

1070
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,200
- and of course he can't find Gordo.
- Miles: That's the best part.

1071
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,500
He cannot find Gordo, okay?
So what happens?

1072
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,600
- He finally finds...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...

1073
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,700
- you don't have to tell this part.
- He's in the bathroom.

1074
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,400
So he kicks down
the stall room door,

1075
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,200
and starts screaming
at the top of his lungs.

1076
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,100
And there's Gordo,

1077
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:20,800
his pants around the ankles,

1078
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,800
"PC World" mag in hand,
and he's punching the cloud.

1079
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,200
I'm sorry.

1080
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:32,400
Spanking.
Frankly, I was spanking.

1081
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,400
And it was a fucking
traumatizing event,

1082
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,000
because I haven't been able to use a public
restroom since that day.

1083
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,800
Me neither.

1084
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,600
I swear to God.

1085
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:43,800
Gordo's got some issues.
He's got some issues.

1086
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,000
And let's not forget,

1087
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:48,800
the great thing that did come from that day
was we said, "Enough!"

1088
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,000
That's the day we started our
own business and said goodbye

1089
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,500
- to shithead bosses. So...
- Hear, hear.

1090
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,400
Leon: I really admire you guys
taking a chance like that.

1091
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,800
Lily: Leon here works at a bank.
What bank did you say it was?

1092
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:00,800
Price Trust.

1093
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,600
No shit, really?

1094
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:06,500
Talk about shithead bosses.
Now that's gotta be a trip.

1095
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,900
- What's he like to work for?
- Oh, you know. He's okay.

1096
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,800
- Really?
- Oh, come on!

1097
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,600
Well, he's a...

1098
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,100
he's just a fucking shithead.
What can I tell you?

1099
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,800
So what do you do
over there at Price?

1100
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,800
I'm the VP in charge
of corporate loans.

1101
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,700
Wow.

1102
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,300
We haven't met anyone
of your level before.

1103
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,500
VP.

1104
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,600
Wait, so that means
it's you and then the P.

1105
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,200
Give that man a Nobel Prize.
Well done.

1106
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:52,400
- Genius.
- Yes, that's right.

1107
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,000
Jake: Here's where a little
research comes in handy.

1108
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,800
Corporate banks give out
VP titles like calendars.

1109
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,600
It's a small lie, but now
we're sure he's playing.

1110
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,400
Then maybe you can help
explain to us what's so difficult

1111
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,700
- about getting a corporate loan?
- Well, normally, nothing.

1112
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,500
But a tech firm right now?

1113
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,000
People are really scared.

1114
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,300
Jake: People are scared
because they lack vision.

1115
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,200
Present company
excluded, of course.

1116
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:19,400
Leon: A bank does need to know
where its money's gonna come from.

1117
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,600
That is true.

1118
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,200
Jake: We know where
we're getting our money back from.

1119
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,000
But therein lies our Catch-22.

1120
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,100
I don't follow.

1121
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,600
- Well...
- Jake, come on.

1122
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,900
No, it's all right.

1123
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,800
Leon here is one
of the good guys.

1124
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,700
Right?

1125
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:41,600
Jake: Now what I'm gonna tell you is in
complete confidence.

1126
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,700
It does not leave
this fucking table.

1127
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,600
- Sure.
- Fine.

1128
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,900
You know how the dot commers
did what they did, right?

1129
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,600
In what way?

1130
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,400
How they made their money.

1131
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,400
Essentially, they start
with an idea,

1132
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,600
shop it around town,
raise a little capital,

1133
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,500
and then sold it
to a bigger company,

1134
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:02,300
like a Microsoft or an Oracle or
an Intel. You know, whatever.

1135
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,100
That's half right there.

1136
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,800
The beauty of it was, they sold it before the
thing was even real.

1137
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,300
So you've got the bigger company already
set up to buy the thing.

1138
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,100
They just want to
see that it works.

1139
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,200
So these guys go out, get some start-up
capital, make it work,

1140
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:18,800
and then sell for five or
six times the initial loan.

1141
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,800
They're delicious.

1142
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:25,000
- But you need a letter of intent.
- Exactly.

1143
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,600
And that's our Catch-22.

1144
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,500
We can't really go out
and talk about it,

1145
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,900
because if it's public,
potentially we start a bidding war,

1146
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,300
and that's considered a breach of
etiquette. Kills the deal.

1147
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,800
However, we wait too long, and we're not
considered hot anymore.

1148
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:42,800
And you have this letter of intent?

1149
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,300
Jake:
Yes we do.

1150
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,800
We're applying the dot com model
to a different product.

1151
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,000
Yeah.

1152
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,800
But the dot coms failed.

1153
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,500
- Yeah, but that's only...
- No, with all due respect.

1154
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,200
It...

1155
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,300
That's going to be
a really tough sell.

1156
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,600
I mean, you guys have
a real battle on your hands.

1157
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,100
- That's bullshit.
- Lupus.

1158
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,800
Look, sorry, Mr. Ashby.

1159
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,700
I didn't mean anything.
But I just don't think

1160
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,500
you can argue with the
success of the business model.

1161
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,700
It was really an
overextension of the model

1162
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:17,100
to what turned out to be
a limited consumer demand

1163
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,300
that caused the
dot com collapse.

1164
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,000
Now, applied to a proper product,
with a solid consumer base,

1165
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,400
the model still holds up.

1166
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,800
He may be right.

1167
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,800
Jake: Let me be straight
with you, all right?

1168
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,100
We're this close to cutting somebody in on
the action,

1169
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,600
if they'd be willing to help.

1170
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,900
We just need to find
somebody with some balls.

1171
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,800
- Shall we order another round?
- Yeah.

1172
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,800
Jake: Lupus, nice save in there.
I'm very impressed.

1173
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,800
Poor bastard never
knew what hit him.

1174
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,900
Jesus Christ, I almost
felt sorry for the guy.

1175
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I gotta go work off
some of this adrenaline.

1176
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,300
I have an in on a card game with some
Hollywood studio dipshits.

1177
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,200
- Anybody want a piece?
- I'm going home.

1178
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:04,000
- I'll go. Jake?
- No, I'm good.

1179
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,900
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1180
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,700
Oh, Lupus, you should come.
You're gonna love these guys.

1181
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,300
Bunch of fucking knobs.

1182
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,300
Hey, Lupus.

1183
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,200
When this is all over,

1184
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,700
you'll let us know who
the King put on Big Al, right?

1185
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,900
You gonna have time?

1186
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,800
I'll find the time.

1187
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,500
You want to go, don't you?

1188
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,800
For a couple hundred bucks?
Not interested.

1189
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,900
You'd do it for free.

1190
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,800
You're almost drooling.
You like the rush.

1191
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:46,100
It's not about the rush.
It's just a job. It's what I do.

1192
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:48,400
Your mother not breast-feed
you or something?

1193
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,400
You asking me if I got
something to prove?

1194
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:54,100
- Do you?
- Not in that repressed anger way.

1195
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,500
I get the feeling you could've bullshitted
your way into anything.

1196
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,000
- Why this?
- I'm good at it.

1197
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:02,100
Lying, cheating, manipulating.

1198
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,200
It all came very naturally to me.

1199
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,800
No, it's more than that.

1200
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:10,600
The thrill of it? I mean, didn't you find it
exciting tonight?

1201
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,400
The way you were
working that guy Ashby...

1202
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,500
flirting, giving him
your sweet little smile,

1203
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:20,900
brushing up against him,
occasionally touching him,

1204
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,100
I have a feeling you were
getting off on that tonight.

1205
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,500
All I did was smile
and shake my ass.

1206
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,100
Yeah, but you
did it very well.

1207
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,300
Soon enough you'll
have more to do

1208
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,400
and I have a feeling you'll
be good at that too.

1209
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,200
How do you know?

1210
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,700
Intuition.

1211
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,800
- She had you tempting fate.
- My old man and his buddies

1212
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,800
from work used to play the same lotto
numbers every week.

1213
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:34,600
I mean the same
numbers for 16 years.

1214
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:38,900
One day he gets pissed, decides he's going
to play his own number.

1215
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,300
They then hit the Lucky Seven
for 3.5 million without him.

1216
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,800
That's fate for you.

1217
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,600
I guess he passed on
that unlucky asshole gene.

1218
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:50,600
Turn around.

1219
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,100
You should have trusted me, Jake.

1220
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,300
Yeah, apparently so.

1221
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,600
Everything looks in order.

1222
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,000
Jake: You know, Leon, we're going
to have to move quickly here.

1223
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,400
I know.
It won't go unnoticed.

1224
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,700
What's this?

1225
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,100
Jake:
Let's call that a convincer.

1226
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:23,000
We're going to need
to slow down a bit.

1227
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:26,000
You're worried about recouping the loan,
we got the letter of intent.

1228
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,400
No, it's... I understand that.

1229
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,900
What I'm trying to...

1230
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,900
what I mean to say is...

1231
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,200
what I'm wondering about is...

1232
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:37,800
is my cut.

1233
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:40,700
Jake: And there it is.
Ashby gets the itch.

1234
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,000
- 2%.
- Lily: Of five million.

1235
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,500
We're gonna make it back
three or four times over.

1236
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,200
By the time anyone catches on,
the loan's already been repaid.

1237
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,400
You didn't do anything wrong
except speed things up.

1238
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:55,200
Jake: All you need to do for your cut, is put
some paperwork through,

1239
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,800
push a button tomorrow.

1240
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:02,300
Man: Yeah, but there were
other factors.

1241
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,700
Yeah, factors that weren't
clear to me until now.

1242
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:15,200
What do you got?

1243
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,400
We got jack shit.

1244
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,000
I'm not a confrontational
man by nature,

1245
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:26,000
but you guys are gonna have
to start working with me.

1246
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:28,000
We haven't heard from Vig.
We don't know if he wants

1247
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,300
to cut us in on this shit he's
got going down with the King.

1248
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,800
Maybe you two guys need to be
a little more pro-active, Lloyd.

1249
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:36,300
You gotta make him think you're gonna
keep me off his back.

1250
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:37,900
And for that he's
gonna cut you in

1251
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,400
on whatever he's got going
with King. You got that?

1252
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,000
Omar, you got it?

1253
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:46,300
Flight's booked to Belize.

1254
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,400
Almost home.

1255
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:01,000
Got to get you home to pack.
Get ready for your trip tomorrow.

1256
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,100
Can you picture me with
a drink with the umbrella in it?

1257
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,100
Little sunscreen on the nose.

1258
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,100
- Hey, Jake!
- Back off! Back off!

1259
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,100
- Whoa, whoa!
- Take it easy! Jesus!

1260
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,800
What, the tip not
work out for you guys?

1261
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:16,300
Tip worked out fine, we're just
a little curious about the Fed.

1262
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,200
Hey look, you don't pay
your fucking taxes...

1263
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,200
Get the fuck back!
Back up!

1264
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:25,700
Special Agent Gunther Butan.
That ring a bell?

1265
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,500
Gunther? No, I think I would remember a
Gunther.

1266
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:32,600
- Let me jog your memory a little.
- Jesus! Fuck!

1267
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,400
Gunther Butan, you say?

1268
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:38,700
I think I might know this guy.

1269
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,100
Yeah, well he's in town and
he sure as shit remembers you.

1270
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,600
What are we gonna
do about this Jake?

1271
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:46,900
We can't afford having
a Fed onto us like this.

1272
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:48,800
I wouldn't dream of that.

1273
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,200
Fuck, man!

1274
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:53,600
The way we look at it,
Jake, you have

1275
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:56,600
a limited window of opportunity here
before he catches up to you.

1276
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:59,000
But I got good news
for you, okay? You got us.

1277
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
We're your white knights. We're gonna
keep him off your back.

1278
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:04,300
And we get a piece of whatever you got
going down with the King.

1279
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,200
And don't argue with me 'cause
I got a lot of pent-up aggression.

1280
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,400
Say something stupid
if we got a deal, Jake.

1281
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,300
Something stupid.

1282
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:18,100
Don't leave town, brother.

1283
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,800
- Funny.
- Oh fuck.

1284
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,300
Have a nice day, Officers.

1285
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,100
How did we do?

1286
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,100
We did exactly like you said.

1287
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,100
I have complete
faith in you, Lloyd.

1288
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,700
Lupus: Why's this guy
so hard up for you?

1289
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,700
You're not exactly a threat
to national security.

1290
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,500
We go way back.

1291
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:38,700
Jake: A few years ago we were
working in Tampa for a local goon.

1292
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,400
Turns out this mutt was
being watched by the Feds,

1293
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:44,300
which now meant we were
being watched by the Feds...

1294
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,400
one in particular...
Agent Gunther Butan.

1295
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,100
We were just overseeing
some creative importing,

1296
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,800
so he really didn't
have anything on us.

1297
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:56,500
But I figured, maybe this
guy's good for a fix.

1298
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,800
Our guys in the LAPD,
give them $20,

1299
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:00,800
they'll look the other way
on a parking ticket.

1300
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,400
Maybe you'll get yourself
a new tie with that.

1301
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,300
But a Fed? You get a guy
like that as your fix...

1302
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,600
It was probably a stupid idea.
There I was Armani and Rolex.

1303
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:11,000
There he is,
JC Penny and Timex.

1304
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:12,800
So I took a shot.

1305
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,200
Now he had me on attempted
bribery of a Federal Agent.

1306
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,800
So that's how Gunter Butan
and I became friends.

1307
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:20,000
- Butan... shit.
- Here.

1308
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:22,400
So what? We just
stay clear of him.

1309
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,600
I don't think so.
I think we gotta walk.

1310
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,800
Wait a minute. We can
handle this. Come on.

1311
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:30,400
No. Not this time.

1312
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,300
I say we walk.

1313
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,500
Wait. Take it easy
for a second.

1314
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:38,000
I'm not gonna take it easy.
'Cause you don't know this guy.

1315
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,500
He's gonna be all over
us like white on rice.

1316
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,300
There's no shaking him
and you know it.

1317
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,300
So we change
the scam a little.

1318
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,200
There is no more
fucking scam.

1319
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,100
I got a sign
on my back now.

1320
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,700
I can't leave town and then show up with a
suitcase full of money.

1321
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,600
- It's over. The gig is up.
- Gordo: Jake, Jake.

1322
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:56,700
The skirt's got a point. All you have to do is
tweak it a bit.

1323
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:01,200
It over. That's it. You gotta
know when to walk away.

1324
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:04,200
And you guys are too careless with the
money. Gordo with the cars.

1325
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:07,200
- You with the strippers.
- They call themselves dancers.

1326
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,500
They call themselves dancers, huh? What
about Big Al?

1327
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,600
Did that not fucking
register with you?

1328
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,900
Remember seeing him sitting there with a
bullet hole in his head?

1329
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:17,300
That doesn't mean anything?

1330
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:19,000
You're being such a raving pussy.

1331
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,500
I mean, pull yourself together,
for Christ's sake.

1332
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:26,200
Who the fuck do you
think you're talking to?

1333
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:30,200
Sweetheart, we fucked
once, okay?

1334
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:33,200
That does not entitle you
a voice in this room.

1335
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:36,400
And don't think I didn't know you weren't
working some angle, either.

1336
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,200
Easy, Jake.
That's a lady.

1337
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:44,000
Everyone's working
an angle, right?

1338
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
There are three people
I trust in this world,

1339
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:48,900
those two guys on
the couch and a dead guy.

1340
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,500
You, I don't know you.
You're like a stray dog

1341
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:53,000
that wandered into my house
one day looking for a belly rub.

1342
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,700
So why don't you just go back to wherever it
is you came from?

1343
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:57,800
You don't have anybody
looking for you.

1344
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,500
Not the King,
not Butan, not Price.

1345
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,200
So just cut loose of this.
It is over.

1346
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,500
- What about...
- What about what?

1347
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:15,000
What about the money?

1348
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,800
There it is. That little
itch you need to scratch.

1349
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,000
Always about the money.

1350
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,900
What do you want?
You want an apology?

1351
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,100
No.
I want my cut.

1352
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:26,700
Take a deep breath,
count to 10,

1353
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:31,200
and try and get it through
your thick skull, there is no cut.

1354
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:35,000
You're an asshole.

1355
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,500
So that's it, huh?

1356
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,300
That's it.
We're closing up shop.

1357
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,700
You guys know
what to do, right?

1358
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,200
Jesus Christ, Jake, I can't
believe you're gonna just...

1359
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,600
Miles.

1360
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,200
Man: So much for honor
among thieves.

1361
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,400
You were going to cut loose your friends,
your girl...

1362
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,400
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1363
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,400
I was doing it for them.
I was trying to protect them.

1364
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,900
Bullshit. You weren't doing it
for them. You were scared.

1365
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,500
Come on, admit it. You lost your nerve and
you lost your confidence.

1366
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,400
You weren't trying
to be noble.

1367
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:11,100
You weren't trying to save anyone but your
goddamn self. Admit it.

1368
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,500
You got no idea what
you're talking about.

1369
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,200
- It's not true.
- It is fucking true.

1370
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:19,200
They were right there for you!
She was right there for you.

1371
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:23,600
Look at her.
I fucking said look at her!

1372
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:26,700
She trusted you,
and you sold her out.

1373
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,700
Now I want you to look at her,

1374
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,300
and I want you to tell her.

1375
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:34,200
Be a fucking man.
You be honest.

1376
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,900
You tell her.

1377
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:40,700
You tell her that you loved her,

1378
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:43,400
but the fucking money
meant more to you.

1379
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,300
Fucking grifters, man.

1380
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:51,600
Gentleman's racket,
my fucking ass.

1381
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:54,700
Just another low-life scammer looking out
for number one.

1382
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,500
Get the fuck up!

1383
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:57,800
Get the fuck up!

1384
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,900
Lupus:
The King ain't gonna like this.

1385
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,200
He had a real thing with
getting this Price guy.

1386
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:06,700
If you ask me,
I think he's jealous.

1387
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:09,200
- Of what? They're both crooks.
- They actually grew up

1388
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:11,400
in the same neighborhood.
King talks about it all the time.

1389
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,300
How come he's always
humping it out,

1390
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:16,000
while Price gets to walk
around in three-piece suits,

1391
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:19,400
hobnob with movie stars,
own a bank, that type of shit.

1392
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:23,500
Next to Price, the King is still small time
and he's pissed off.

1393
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,200
A point, Lupus.
Give us a point.

1394
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:30,700
I don't give a shit if he thinks he's a pimple
on Price's ass.

1395
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,800
He wouldn't piss on my face
if my teeth were on fire.

1396
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,800
That's nice.
Interesting imagery.

1397
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:39,500
Look at that.
The size of a cigar, right?

1398
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,900
You know why I got that? The King asked
me for a four-shot one day.

1399
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,800
That's four-shots of espressos.

1400
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:47,300
Turns out we only have
enough coffee for a three-shot.

1401
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,400
So I'm thinking, maybe
I'm doing him a favor.

1402
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,300
And before he even
comes picks it up,

1403
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:54,300
he's screaming at me like
I just hit on his mother!

1404
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,400
I assume this is going to
lead to some kind of point.

1405
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:00,300
This is what I get for bringing
him the wrong fucking cup of coffee,

1406
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:03,300
imagine what he's
going to do to you.

1407
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,400
Jake: I have to admit,
he did have a point.

1408
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,700
There was no way the King
was going to let us slide.

1409
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,900
Yeah, so we were back on.

1410
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,900
After you cut her loose?

1411
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Which was apparently
my mistake.

1412
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:17,400
How'd you know we'd
still go through with it?

1413
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,400
I know you, Jake.

1414
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,400
And I know how to
take care of myself.

1415
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,400
Morgan Price, please.

1416
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:35,600
Yeah, I'd be interested in that.

1417
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:38,800
Why don't you give me an address

1418
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:41,400
and I'll send over a car?

1419
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,600
And you and I can discuss
the particulars of your proposal.

1420
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,400
No.

1421
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,400
I come to you and
I only deal with you.

1422
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:54,900
It was a smart play.

1423
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,200
She handed me to you
on a silver platter.

1424
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,800
Silver platter? Motherfucker,
let me tell you a story.

1425
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:04,500
That's an exciting story.
Travis,

1426
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:07,600
anybody ever try
something like this before?

1427
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:09,300
Not that I can recall.

1428
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:12,100
And how much did you say you
wanted for this finder's fee?

1429
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,600
10%.

1430
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:17,400
I studied under a Nobel Laureate
of Economics at Cambridge

1431
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,000
and I think even she'd
say 10 was high.

1432
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:24,200
I don't give a fuck if you studied at Marice's
Academy of Wig Design.

1433
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,500
You're lucky I'm even here.

1434
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,500
- 10 is standard.
- Okay.

1435
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:34,000
Travis, see if you can get him
to tell you how he did it.

1436
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:37,600
Or almost did it.

1437
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,000
Sounds like a good story.

1438
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:42,000
Oh, I'll get it.

1439
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,900
Come on,
what happened today?

1440
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,900
Today?
Today started off great.

1441
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:53,000
Jake: Ashby was going to call us
with the exact time of the transfer.

1442
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,900
The King was waiting on us.

1443
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,900
Just to be safe, Gordo was
boarding the plane instead of me.

1444
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,400
I needed Manzano and Whitworth
to keep Butan off our backs.

1445
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:04,400
So I had to stay in town
and cut them in on the deal.

1446
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:07,600
So they waited for my call
while Miles and I waited for Ashby.

1447
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,000
She should be landing
right about now.

1448
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:12,300
That Customs guy is ready, right?

1449
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:15,200
I feel lucky today, Miles.
Real lucky.

1450
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:17,800
Found a penny,
heads up.

1451
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:20,200
And I got rid of the redhead.

1452
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:23,600
Yeah. We got rid
of the redhead.

1453
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,900
Jake?

1454
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,900
Customs?

1455
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,600
They say a good chess player
can see up to 20 moves deep.

1456
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:36,100
That means in some games you've
calculated every move in your head.

1457
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:39,700
The game's over,
even before it's really started.

1458
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,500
Like a game of chess,
same with a con.

1459
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,600
You have to see that deep.

1460
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,200
- Yeah?
- Ashby,

1461
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,800
- It's Vig.
- Jake, yeah.

1462
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:51,200
It's going through...

1463
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,700
right... now.

1464
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,200
Good.

1465
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:58,600
And with the push of a button,
all the pieces were in play.

1466
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:01,100
Gordo?
It's all good. Do it.

1467
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,100
First and goal.

1468
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,300
Hi there.

1469
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:30,700
I'd like this cashed, please.

1470
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:36,700
Receptionist:
Mr. Ashby?

1471
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:39,800
Mr. Thompson from international calling. He
has a 34-R

1472
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,600
on a corporate
account in Belize.

1473
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:46,400
That's probably just a new
account marker, I'II...

1474
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,600
Jake: To ensure we weren't
going to welch,

1475
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:52,400
Ashby's cut was transferred
into his own offshore account.

1476
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,200
Tell you what.
I am going to lunch.

1477
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:59,500
You tell him I'll
call him back later.

1478
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:06,400
Jake: We called them
the Green Twinkies.

1479
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,500
We got Twinkies.

1480
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:18,500
Gordo, that's outstanding.
Good work.

1481
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:22,600
Lupus,
we got the money.

1482
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:24,600
I don't believe this.

1483
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,800
Gordo's flying back
with it now.

1484
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:30,600
So we'll head on over to the bar, meet up
with everybody there.

1485
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:33,800
I sent Miles to the airport
to wait for Gordo to land.

1486
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:35,800
Everything was going
as planned.

1487
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,500
Gordo?

1488
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:45,900
Gordo, do me a favor. Just use the
bathroom on the plane, all right?

1489
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,200
Gordo?
Gordo!

1490
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,000
Guy's walking around with
$5 million cash

1491
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:54,500
and he's going to stop to use
a public bathroom at the airport?

1492
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,400
Un-fucking-believable.

1493
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,600
That guy's got
a serious problem.

1494
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:00,600
You're telling me.

1495
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:05,000
Here's where I got stupid, here's
where I got that big fucking itch.

1496
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,100
What?
I got something on me?

1497
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,300
I'm going to be straight
with you, Lupus.

1498
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,800
I don't think we could've
gotten this far without you.

1499
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,800
So I got a little
proposition for you.

1500
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:21,200
A way for us to clear
the whole five million.

1501
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:25,700
Now think about that,
five million split four ways.

1502
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,200
You want in?

1503
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:31,200
- What do I have to do?
- All right.

1504
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,600
Yeah, it's Vig.

1505
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:36,400
I'm gonna need an escort.
Not a ride, just an escort.

1506
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:38,700
Ontario Airport.
Look for Gordo.

1507
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,900
He's going to be carrying
a black Nike duffel bag.

1508
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,500
- You guys take care of Butan?
- Don't worry. We got him covered.

1509
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:45,900
All right, good.

1510
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,200
That was him. There's a shipment coming
in this afternoon.

1511
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:53,100
Ontario Airport.

1512
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:56,000
We're going to give Mr. Jake Vig the
surprise of a lifetime.

1513
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,900
- FBI Agent Rosen speaking.
- Artie. Butan.

1514
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,700
Yeah. Ontario Airport this afternoon. Come
heavy.

1515
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:08,100
All we need you to do is call
the King. Tell him it's all good.

1516
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,000
Get the King off of our backs.

1517
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,600
Yeah, boss, it's me, Lupus.

1518
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:19,300
You were right.
He's trying to fuck you.

1519
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,500
- What?
- Vig's trying to fuck you.

1520
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,600
Police escorts are going
to pick up the money.

1521
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:27,000
I knew it, I knew it... I should
have listened to my instinct.

1522
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,900
Shit! How do we get
the money now?

1523
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
You gonna have to
take it in the airport.

1524
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:33,000
The guy he's got a black
Nike duffel bag on wheels.

1525
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,600
He's got this thing
with bathrooms.

1526
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:37,100
If he makes it through Customs he'll be
heading for the john.

1527
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,900
That's good. We'll get him
with his pants down.

1528
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,600
You'll take care of scooter
once we get the money.

1529
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,200
Maybe Gordo's got it right.

1530
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:47,400
Maybe we're all just looking
for a safe place to shit.

1531
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:52,700
That's cute.

1532
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,600
Very cute.

1533
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:04,000
What about all that
bullshit at the bar?

1534
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:07,600
About your three-shot,
four-shot espresso sob story?

1535
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:11,100
Showing me your little boo-boo. What was
all that fucking shit?

1536
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:16,400
That? I got that
at a barbecue, grilling halibut.

1537
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:37,100
- Lloyd: You trust this Butan guy?
- I don't trust anybody.

1538
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,800
Lloyd: I'm so sick of listening
to this douche bag's shit.

1539
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:41,300
I swear to fucking God.

1540
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:42,800
If my kid's teeth
weren't so fucked up,

1541
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:44,800
I'd love to walk up to that dude and take
that gay hat of his

1542
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:46,800
and shove it right up
his ass on principle.

1543
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:48,900
You see how bad
this guy wants Vig?

1544
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,700
It's like a sickness.

1545
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,200
I say we collar him ourselves.
That way we got Vig,

1546
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:55,300
we got leverage and we trade.

1547
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:57,300
Vig for the tape.

1548
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:59,600
This is Butan.
You guys awake?

1549
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,300
Yeah, we're here.

1550
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:05,000
Okay, stay sharp.

1551
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,100
- Be right back.
- Is this it?

1552
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,100
This it, Harlin?

1553
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,500
Motherfucking no brains,
this one has.

1554
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:30,500
Jake: So Lupus.
What do you do now?

1555
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:33,300
You go back to fetching
coffee for the King?

1556
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:36,600
Don't worry about me.
Stop trying to fuck with my head.

1557
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:47,900
Okay, I got him.

1558
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,600
He's heading towards
the east exit.

1559
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:20,400
Do not under any
circumstances apprehend.

1560
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:23,200
I want you to follow him
all the way down to Vig's.

1561
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:26,200
- Roger that.
- We got that jerkoff. Let's go.

1562
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:43,200
Keep your pants on.
He just went into the crapper.

1563
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,000
Jake: Let's say Gordo doesn't
make it through Customs.

1564
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,200
You're gonna be just
as fucked as we are.

1565
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:04,200
- You think about that?
- Not for nothing, Jake,

1566
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,300
but the guy who
whacked your buddy?

1567
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,300
It was me.

1568
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:12,000
The King usually farms out
for that kind of stuff,

1569
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:16,200
but he was so pissed off at you he couldn't
wait for the regular guy.

1570
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:19,200
The fucker didn't even put
down the kung pao chicken.

1571
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,700
Oo-ooh, shit!

1572
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,900
Come on.
Stand up.

1573
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
- What?
- Stand the fuck up!

1574
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:36,800
Jake, no offense,
but I've seen you fight.

1575
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:38,400
You gotta be kidding me.

1576
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,900
Okay, they pulled a switch.

1577
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:48,700
Black man, brown suit. Big.

1578
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,800
Hey, asshole.

1579
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:15,500
- (police sirens blare)
- Lloyd: Keep 'em up nice and high.

1580
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:20,700
Lloyd:
What the...

1581
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:28,200
- Don't fucking move.
- Freeze!

1582
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,100
- Freeze!
- Freeze!

1583
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:32,300
Put your weapon down!

1584
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,400
We're LAPD!

1585
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:37,000
- Get down on your knees.
- We're fucking cops.

1586
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,100
LAPD, man.
Look at this, come on.

1587
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:50,000
- On the curb!
- Face forward! All the way down!

1588
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:51,800
Hands on your head.

1589
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:53,500
Hands outside where
we can see them.

1590
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,300
Bring him out.
Nice and easy. Turn around.

1591
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,800
Can I make a suggestion?

1592
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:02,500
Take these cuffs home and use
them on your wife. You'll like it.

1593
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:09,600
I like it tight, but not that tight.
How about you?

1594
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:11,000
- Let's go.
- Oh.

1595
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,100
Look what we got here.

1596
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,400
Heroin. Two keys.

1597
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,200
We're good.

1598
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,900
He's good.
He's good.

1599
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,900
- He who?
- You gotta like it.

1600
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,300
Officers Manzano
and Whitworth,

1601
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,300
Agent Artie Rosen,

1602
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:47,200
Federal Bureau of Investigations.

1603
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:50,000
How hard do you think it is to sell one
dealer's drugs to another?

1604
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,500
Don't fucking say anything!

1605
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,300
(cell phone ringing)

1606
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:06,300
Yeah.

1607
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,900
The King just got
pinched with the bag.

1608
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,600
Okay.

1609
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,300
What happened?

1610
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:18,600
- He got caught.
- What?

1611
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:21,100
Fucking King just
got us all pinched.

1612
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:24,600
Oh shit! What do I do?
What the fuck...

1613
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,400
Lupus, just
calm down. Lupus!

1614
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,300
(gunshot)

1615
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:40,000
- I never thanked you for that.
- No problem.

1616
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,800
Can we all stop being so fucking polite and
get to the point?

1617
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,900
That's right,
where's the fucking money, Jake?

1618
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,900
What do you get out of this?
A fucking finder's fee?

1619
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:49,200
It's all about
the money, isn't it?

1620
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:51,800
Fuck you.
You sold me out.

1621
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,900
You sold me out huge.
You should have trusted me,

1622
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,200
like I trusted you.
You fucked up. You fucked up huge.

1623
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:57,900
All right, all right,
now you turn the fuck around.

1624
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,800
The only way you're gonna live
is if you get me my fucking money!

1625
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:02,800
Now where the fuck is it?

1626
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:06,400
I'm gonna ask you one more time before
your brains hit the ground.

1627
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:08,400
Where is my money?

1628
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:11,800
Probably in the hands of
the Federal Government.

1629
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:13,600
You know Jake, you...

1630
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:16,200
you really fucking
disappoint me, Jake.

1631
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:18,800
You just let Lily down
here again, too.

1632
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:21,600
What was that you were saying
about playing the big con,

1633
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:25,100
it's like putting on a big play, and everybody
knows their part?

1634
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:29,900
I guess some people
forgot their fucking lines.

1635
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:32,200
- Yeah, I guess so.
- You guess so?

1636
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:34,200
So why don't you just take
a deep breath, Jake,

1637
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:36,300
and I'm gonna count to 10.

1638
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:39,100
One, two...

1639
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:42,400
three, four, five...

1640
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:45,000
- I do trust you, Lily.
- Six, seven...

1641
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,700
- (gunshot)
- Travis: Oh, shit! What the...

1642
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:51,000
- Trust...
- Did you kill him?

1643
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,900
- Should be a four-letter word.

1644
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,700
I don't know.

1645
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:01,000
Don't do that shit while
I'm standing right here!

1646
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:04,700
You get the fuck away from me.
Get the fuck out of here! Now!

1647
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:12,300
So I'm dead.
But can I really blame Lily?

1648
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:14,800
Should I just have trusted her?
Who knows?

1649
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:20,100
Sooner or later, someone's gonna start
asking the right questions.

1650
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:23,300
The Feds would want to know

1651
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:26,200
why were they sent in to just
bust a couple of crooked cops.

1652
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:28,300
Manzano and Whitworth
would ask

1653
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:30,700
how the drugs got
into that duffel bag.

1654
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:35,200
The King and Price would ask,
where their money really went.

1655
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:39,100
And everyone would ask,
what agency was it that

1656
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,500
Special Agent Gunther Butan
really worked for?

1657
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,000
You need a ride?

1658
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,000
Hey.

1659
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,400
How'd it go?

1660
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:07,500
Smooth.

1661
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,400
The guys we have
in the LAPD,

1662
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:11,600
give them $20 and they'll look the other way
on a parking ticket.

1663
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:13,900
Maybe you'll get yourself
a new tie with that?

1664
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:16,600
But a Fed, you get a guy
like that as your fix...

1665
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,300
So what do you
got going next?

1666
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,800
So that's how Gunther Butan
and I became friends.

1667
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:27,500
Look at you. You're still
working that crazy tie routine.

1668
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,800
I'm partial to it.

1669
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:32,800
You take your cut?

1670
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,000
Yeah, I'm good.

1671
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:39,000
Well, where you off to next?

1672
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:43,000
Wherever it is, don't stay
too long, you know?

1673
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,400
- Stay loose.
- Always.

1674
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:50,200
I'd keep the girl.

1675
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:59,400
Sooner or later, all the right questions would
get answered.

1676
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:02,100
- Because playing the big con...
- What's this?

1677
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:03,800
- Is like putting on a play.

1678
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:07,800
A play where everyone knows
their part, except the mark.

1679
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:11,800
Sometimes, Jake,
style can get you killed.

1680
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:21,200
And like in a game of chess, you've played
every move in your head.

1681
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,800
Yeah, boss.
It's me, Lupus.

1682
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:26,900
You were right.
He's trying to fuck you.

1683
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:30,700
You're a good grifter, man.
It's hard to tell when you're lying.

1684
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:32,400
It's hard.

1685
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:35,200
But what do I care?
I'm dead.

1686
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:37,600
Nobody's gonna be
asking me.

1687
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:41,100
I think you dropped
that, baby.

1688
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:43,800
Miles, would you
be so kind?

1689
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:45,800
Absolutely.

1690
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,200
* The lights go out
and I can't be saved *

1691
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:57,700
* Tides that I tried
to swim against *

1692
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:01,200
* Have brought me down
upon my knees *

1693
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:05,200
* Oh I beg, I beg
and plead, singing *

1694
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:08,200
* Come out of things unsaid *

1695
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:12,100
* Shoot an apple
off my head, and a *

1696
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:15,200
* Trouble that can't be named *

1697
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:19,900
* A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing *

1698
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,800
* You *

1699
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:26,300
* Are *

1700
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:30,900
* You *

1701
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
* Are *

1702
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:50,600
* Confusion never stops *

1703
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:54,000
* Closing walls
and ticking clocks *

1704
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:57,700
* Gonna come back
and take you home *

1705
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:01,700
* I could not stop that
you now know, singing *

1706
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:04,900
* Come out upon my seas *

1707
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
* Cursed missed opportunities *

1708
01:29:08,100 --> 01:29:11,400
* Am I a part of the cure? *

1709
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:16,000
* Or am I part of the disease?
Singing *

1710
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,000
* You *

1711
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:22,200
* Are *

1712
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:27,100
* You *

1713
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:29,200
* Are *

1714
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:34,200
* You *

1715
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:36,200
* Are *

1716
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:41,200
* You *

1717
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,100
* Are *

1718
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:02,000
* You *

1719
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:04,300
* Are *

1720
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:09,200
* You *

1721
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:11,500
* Are *

1722
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:18,200
* And nothing else compares *

1723
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:25,400
* Oh, nothing else compares *

1724
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:32,900
* And nothing else compares *

1725
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:12,500
* You *

1726
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:14,600

01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:19,600
* You *

1728
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:21,600
* Are *

1729
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:24,600
* Home, home *

1730
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:28,600
* Where I wanted to go *

1731
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:31,700
