1
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:39,541
So, I'm dead...

2
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:43,660
and I think it's because
of this redhead.

3
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,900
Do you know who I am, Jake?

4
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,979
The Antichrist?

5
00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:51,539
I'm just a guy
looking for some answers.

6
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:54,099
Hey, you know, pal,
ain't we all?

7
00:00:56,498 --> 00:00:58,898
Things are probably gonna
end bad for you tonight, Jake.

8
00:00:58,978 --> 00:01:01,058
Yeah, I'm starting
to get that feeling.

9
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:05,817
Is your life flashing
before your eyes?

10
00:01:05,897 --> 00:01:08,496
Honestly?
Just the last three weeks.

11
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:10,256
It's not a bad place to start.

12
00:01:13,376 --> 00:01:15,215
Calm down, okay? I'm sorry.

13
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:17,175
I lost my head in there,
I don't know what happened.

14
00:01:17,215 --> 00:01:19,135
You fucking shot him,
that's what happened.

15
00:01:19,215 --> 00:01:22,174
What other fucking choice do I have?
The motherfucker was gonna welch.

16
00:01:22,254 --> 00:01:23,174
Did you not hear him?
Did you not see him?

17
00:01:23,254 --> 00:01:24,814
I can't be here, man,
do you understand me?

18
00:01:24,894 --> 00:01:27,254
- I can't fucking be here!
- Listen to me, all right?

19
00:01:27,334 --> 00:01:30,133
It went to shit,
that happens sometimes.

20
00:01:30,213 --> 00:01:33,013
- Oh, fuck, man!
- You're not listening, Lionel.

21
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:35,932
We can still get through this,
we still have some time,

22
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,612
but I need you
to use your fucking head,

23
00:01:37,652 --> 00:01:39,572
and I need you to trust me.

24
00:01:40,572 --> 00:01:42,491
Can you do that?

25
00:01:43,931 --> 00:01:45,811
- (police sirens blare)
- Let's go!

26
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,610
Jake:
Come on, let's hustle it up.

27
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:03,528
Come on,
grab his feet, will you?

28
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,688
Lionel, he's dead, all right?
Maybe you didn't pull the trigger,

29
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,167
but you were standing right there
and you saw me do it.

30
00:02:11,247 --> 00:02:13,247
Now grab his fucking legs.

31
00:02:13,327 --> 00:02:14,887
Bartender:
Tick-tock.

32
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:17,286
Hey, you wanna help, then help.
If not, shut your piehole.

33
00:02:17,326 --> 00:02:18,286
Your mess!

34
00:02:18,326 --> 00:02:21,166
Jake: Do me a favor, please,
shut your fucking mouth.

35
00:02:21,206 --> 00:02:22,646
My place.

36
00:02:23,565 --> 00:02:25,485
Maybe now,
you'll shut the fuck up.

37
00:02:26,245 --> 00:02:27,925
Please!

38
00:02:28,725 --> 00:02:31,484
You think this kind of shit
hasn't happened here before?

39
00:02:31,564 --> 00:02:34,244
Given, it's usually on Wednesday and
usually I tell the cops,

40
00:02:34,284 --> 00:02:37,923
"No, officer, I didn't get
a good look at the shooters."

41
00:02:37,963 --> 00:02:39,523
Usually, anyway...

42
00:02:39,603 --> 00:02:41,563
I swear to God,
I didn't see anything.

43
00:02:41,643 --> 00:02:42,963
You let me go,
I won't say a word, I promise.

44
00:02:43,043 --> 00:02:46,322
Don't get hysterical on us, sweetheart, all
right?

45
00:02:46,402 --> 00:02:48,002
I can't fucking be here!

46
00:02:48,082 --> 00:02:52,281
Then you know what, Lionel,
maybe you should go.

47
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,960
What about the money?

48
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,719
What about this situation
makes you think

49
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:06,999
I can answer that question,
right now?

50
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:10,199
Fuck! Fuck!

51
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:11,598
(screams)

52
00:03:11,678 --> 00:03:14,518
(police sirens blare)

53
00:03:25,556 --> 00:03:27,556
Cop #1:
Freeze!

54
00:03:29,596 --> 00:03:31,556
Freeze, you motherfucking
cocksucking scumbags!

55
00:03:31,636 --> 00:03:33,195
All right, guys,
stop waving those things...

56
00:03:33,275 --> 00:03:36,235
What took you so fucking long?
Jesus Christ!

57
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:38,755
It's like 100 degrees in here
and I'm lying in this shit forever.

58
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:41,154
What the fuck! You guys were late,
we had to go to a Mexican stand-off.

59
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:43,674
We had to go to gunplay.
Gentlemen, that isn't our racket.

60
00:03:43,714 --> 00:03:44,874
We were busy fighting crime.

61
00:03:44,954 --> 00:03:47,913
You're keeping the streets safe
from pedophiles and drug dealers?

62
00:03:47,993 --> 00:03:50,433
Oh! Goddamn it.

63
00:03:50,513 --> 00:03:52,553
I told you, you're using too much powder,
look at my fucking shirt.

64
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:53,752
I understand,
but you know something?

65
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:55,512
You don't get
the nice splatter effect.

66
00:03:55,552 --> 00:03:56,752
Look at this splatter effect.

67
00:03:56,832 --> 00:03:58,552
The ones with blood
come out of your cut.

68
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,151
- I can live with that.
- Hey, Jake,

69
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:02,271
when do I get
to play the inside?

70
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:04,831
Gordo plays the inside.
You are the shill, you know that.

71
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,470
Yeah, but come on, all I do
is cry and get insulted here.

72
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,790
What are you talking about?

73
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,030
You should get a fucking Academy Award
for the shill work you do.

74
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,110
Jake: Big Al, does anyone
do it better than you?

75
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,869
Come on, we've got
a good thing going here.

76
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:16,749
You want to jinx us
by changing things?

77
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:19,189
Yeah, you're right,
I don't want to jinx anything.

78
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,588
Of course I'm right.
Here you go, that's your cut.

79
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,828
- Thank you.
- Good work, paisan.

80
00:04:26,748 --> 00:04:29,267
- What?
- It's a lot of cash.

81
00:04:29,307 --> 00:04:30,747
He came up with it
awfully quick.

82
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:32,707
Did you see how quickly
he got out of here?

83
00:04:32,787 --> 00:04:35,706
- He's not coming back, it's over.
- Okay, fine.

84
00:04:35,786 --> 00:04:39,146
I've gotta pinch a loaf.
Did anybody mess up the hoop?

85
00:04:39,226 --> 00:04:42,545
- It's clean.
- Gentlemen,

86
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,745
10%, your cut. Enjoy!

87
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,744
You guys got a lot of sack, man.
I'll give you that much.

88
00:04:48,824 --> 00:04:51,584
It's confidence.
Just confidence.

89
00:04:52,104 --> 00:04:53,544
It doesn't matter what the con is.

90
00:04:53,624 --> 00:04:56,703
Insider trading,
a line we got at a bookie club,

91
00:04:56,783 --> 00:04:58,663
insurance scam, whatever.

92
00:04:58,743 --> 00:05:02,502
You've seen the money
and you want it. More of it.

93
00:05:02,582 --> 00:05:04,982
So who cares if you have
to bend the rules a little bit?

94
00:05:05,062 --> 00:05:07,622
As long as nobody gets hurt.

95
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:09,581
But then somebody does.

96
00:05:09,661 --> 00:05:12,301
- (gunshot)
- (scream)

97
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,940
Tommy Suits always said,
"A confidence game

98
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,940
is like putting on a play,
where everyone knows their part.

99
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,979
The inside man, the roper,
the shills,

100
00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:25,979
everyone, that is,
except for the mark."

101
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:29,458
So now you're
an accomplice in a homicide.

102
00:05:29,498 --> 00:05:31,498
Everything you thought
you were in control of,

103
00:05:31,538 --> 00:05:34,418
just flew out the window,
or is dripping down your leg.

104
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,417
You should be running out the door,

105
00:05:36,497 --> 00:05:38,697
desperate to forget
that this ever happened,

106
00:05:38,777 --> 00:05:40,697
and ready to repent
your greedy ways.

107
00:05:40,777 --> 00:05:42,257
What about the money?

108
00:05:42,337 --> 00:05:44,736
Jake:
Then there it is again, that itch.

109
00:05:44,816 --> 00:05:47,456
There's a guy standing in front
of you with a smoking gun,

110
00:05:47,536 --> 00:05:49,975
another guy on the floor
bleeding all over the place,

111
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:52,335
and all you can do
is think about the money.

112
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,495
You're a sick twisted fuck.

113
00:05:54,575 --> 00:05:56,774
So we gotta make sure
we give you the blow off.

114
00:05:56,854 --> 00:06:00,374
We have to make sure that you never
ever come looking for us again.

115
00:06:00,454 --> 00:06:03,773
We have to get you off
of our backs, forever.

116
00:06:03,853 --> 00:06:05,573
(police sirens blare)

117
00:06:05,653 --> 00:06:07,653
That's why
we give you the fix.

118
00:06:08,373 --> 00:06:09,932
Fuck.

119
00:06:10,012 --> 00:06:13,092
Fuck! Fuck!

120
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:14,092
Fuck!

121
00:06:14,172 --> 00:06:16,132
LAPD's finest.

122
00:06:16,212 --> 00:06:18,091
Half as smart
and twice as crooked

123
00:06:18,131 --> 00:06:20,131
- as the guy they just chased away.
- Freeze! Motherfucking scumbags...

124
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,491
Sucking-fucking cocksuckers!

125
00:06:21,571 --> 00:06:23,291
Man:
Grifters.

126
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,370
We all can't be
model citizens such as yourself.

127
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,850
- It's all about the money, isn't it?
- Ain't it always?

128
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,449
Jake:
That's what makes us run.

129
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:34,009
- What's your name?
- Dutch.

130
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:36,449
- And despite what they say...
- I love that name.

131
00:06:36,489 --> 00:06:39,848
- Me too.
- It can buy you love.

132
00:06:39,928 --> 00:06:41,808
Check it out,
original leather seats,

133
00:06:41,888 --> 00:06:45,007
soft top, and you're gonna
love this, suicide doors.

134
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:46,207
- Nice!

135
00:06:46,247 --> 00:06:48,607
Jake:
It can say everything about you.

136
00:06:48,647 --> 00:06:51,806
It can erase all those things
about you, you wish didn't exist.

137
00:06:51,886 --> 00:06:54,126
It's Alphonse. I wanna settle up.

138
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,126
No, I haven't been ducking you.

139
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,565
I told you, I get it.

140
00:06:58,605 --> 00:07:00,645
Jake: It can make you think
you're on top of the world.

141
00:07:00,725 --> 00:07:02,965
And if you believe that money
can do all that for you,

142
00:07:03,045 --> 00:07:05,044
you are the perfect mark.

143
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:08,444
Oops!

144
00:07:21,722 --> 00:07:23,402
Wasn't it Jack Kerouac who said,

145
00:07:23,482 --> 00:07:25,281
"If you own a rug,
you own too much."

146
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,561
I don't necessarily like Kerouac,

147
00:07:27,641 --> 00:07:29,521
and driving cross-country
isn't my idea of a good time,

148
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:30,521
but the guy's got a point.

149
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:32,960
(answering machine)
...three messages.

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,160
Hey, it's Monica, Bill. I'm still
dizzy from the other night. Call me.

151
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,359
Hi Scott, Just thought I'd call you
and tell you I'm back.

152
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,039
You know the number,
it's Kate, by the way.

153
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:46,958
Bruce, it's Cheryl, if you don't want to see
me, just say so.

154
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:48,918
But this is the last time
I'm calling.

155
00:07:48,998 --> 00:07:51,838
Jake: If you've got nothing,
you've got nothing to lose.

156
00:07:51,878 --> 00:07:54,997
But when it comes to money, whether it's
finding it or losing it,

157
00:07:55,037 --> 00:07:58,197
you just have to remember
how much of it is just luck.

158
00:08:00,196 --> 00:08:02,156
Oops!

159
00:08:06,915 --> 00:08:09,755
Jake:
Just dumb fucking luck.

160
00:08:16,754 --> 00:08:19,514
(door slams open)

161
00:08:19,554 --> 00:08:21,273
Mr. Dolby?

162
00:08:21,353 --> 00:08:23,433
Mr. King would like a word with you.

163
00:08:24,593 --> 00:08:28,112
- Now? Right now?
- We have a car waiting.

164
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:39,631
(phone ringing)

165
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:42,950
- Hello.
- You better get over to Al's now.

166
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,710
- For what?
- (dial tone)

167
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,669
Hello?

168
00:08:53,869 --> 00:08:56,348
Nothing.
Who the fuck?!

169
00:08:56,428 --> 00:08:59,308
There's a couple hundred bucks on
his dresser. All of his shit's here.

170
00:08:59,348 --> 00:09:01,068
This definitely wasn't
a random thing.

171
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:02,947
Is it ever a random thing?

172
00:09:05,987 --> 00:09:09,306
Shit, Al.
What did you do?

173
00:09:09,386 --> 00:09:11,306
- Let's just think about this...
- Gordo: This fucking town, man.

174
00:09:11,346 --> 00:09:14,786
Jesus Christ,
I had a bad feeling about LA.

175
00:09:14,866 --> 00:09:17,585
Didn't I say that?
This damn fucking town!

176
00:09:17,665 --> 00:09:19,665
Gordo, now is not
the time for that, all right?

177
00:09:19,745 --> 00:09:21,345
I'm sorry,
I'm just a little...

178
00:09:21,425 --> 00:09:23,584
Jesus Christ. Look at
what they did to him, Jake.

179
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,944
Right in the middle
of his egg foo yung.

180
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,584
Think they know about us?
What if they get to us too?

181
00:09:28,664 --> 00:09:31,623
Don't start
freaking out, okay?

182
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:36,742
Let's get Al out of here first.
Miles, get a blanket or something.

183
00:09:36,822 --> 00:09:38,502
No, we're going to
leave him right here.

184
00:09:39,982 --> 00:09:41,422
What are you, high?

185
00:09:41,462 --> 00:09:43,941
We're not leaving Al here.

186
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:48,181
Gordo: Grab that end, now.
Grab it, Miles!

187
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,380
Jake: Miles, pick up the table
and put it back.

188
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,139
Gordo, let go of the fucking rug.
I said we're leaving him here.

189
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:00,499
Drop it.

190
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:04,618
Fuck you! How long have we
worked with this fucking guy?

191
00:10:04,698 --> 00:10:07,618
I'm not going to just fucking
leave him here! All right?

192
00:10:07,658 --> 00:10:10,977
Gordo,
get a fucking grip.

193
00:10:14,617 --> 00:10:16,577
We're leaving him here.

194
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:42,053
Jake: Big Al used to send
money to his father,

195
00:10:42,093 --> 00:10:45,452
a Vietnam vet slowly losing his mind in a VA
hospital in Cleveland.

196
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,972
- Al was like that.
- Now you coming?

197
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:56,491
Jake: That's why Al never
played the inside.

198
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,610
There he is.
So what do you hear?

199
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,849
Well, Lionel Dolby came down with a
sudden case of drowning last night.

200
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:10,409
They just pulled him out
of the Silverlake reservoir.

201
00:11:10,489 --> 00:11:12,568
Now I know why he
was such a good rope.

202
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:15,488
I mean, cash, that much, and we never had
to put him on the send?

203
00:11:15,528 --> 00:11:18,168
Turns out this fucking mope
is an accountant for the King.

204
00:11:18,248 --> 00:11:20,727
The what? Who's that?

205
00:11:20,807 --> 00:11:23,727
The cash we fleeced off him
was collection money.

206
00:11:23,807 --> 00:11:26,126
Bookies, pushers,
you know, whatever.

207
00:11:26,206 --> 00:11:28,286
He was supposed to take that
money and give it back to the King

208
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:30,966
earlier yesterday,
like he does every Thursday,

209
00:11:31,006 --> 00:11:34,125
except this time that fucking stenad figured
he could make

210
00:11:34,205 --> 00:11:36,885
a little something off of us and still get the
money back to King

211
00:11:36,925 --> 00:11:38,885
before anybody says, "Boo."

212
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,444
- Okay, what's a king?
- Currently?

213
00:11:41,524 --> 00:11:44,404
A very large-type pole stuck
right up our asses, Miles.

214
00:11:44,444 --> 00:11:46,763
- Mob?
- No.

215
00:11:46,843 --> 00:11:48,643
No. Independent.

216
00:11:48,723 --> 00:11:50,323
Winston King.

217
00:11:50,403 --> 00:11:53,242
He likes to call
himself "The King."

218
00:11:53,282 --> 00:11:56,002
How'd they get to Al?

219
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,042
It's beautiful.

220
00:11:57,122 --> 00:12:00,721
Last night Al calls some
bookie out in Redondo,

221
00:12:00,801 --> 00:12:03,281
tells them he's got
the cash to settle up.

222
00:12:03,361 --> 00:12:06,640
Because, apparently he's been ducking this
guy for like a month.

223
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,720
Classic fucking Al, right?

224
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,880
So the bookie asks where he's
got this money, all of a sudden.

225
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,279
Does Al tell this guy that he just cashed a
fucking bar mitzvah bond?

226
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,999
That he's been giving head
for 20 bucks a pop? No.

227
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:20,678
No.

228
00:12:20,758 --> 00:12:23,718
The fucking idiot starts
going on and on about how

229
00:12:23,798 --> 00:12:27,077
this job he just pulled,
how he fleeced Dolby...

230
00:12:28,277 --> 00:12:30,317
how he fleeced...

231
00:12:30,357 --> 00:12:32,517
- You pissed we didn't get credit?
- No, no, no.

232
00:12:32,597 --> 00:12:35,196
That was the only semi-fucking
smart thing he said.

233
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:37,116
Except, anybody that's
ever met Big Al

234
00:12:37,196 --> 00:12:39,316
knows the only thing he's comfortable
doing alone

235
00:12:39,396 --> 00:12:41,275
is eating.

236
00:12:41,355 --> 00:12:43,555
So this guy tells that guy,
that guy tells some other guy,

237
00:12:43,635 --> 00:12:45,835
eventually it gets back to someone who
works for the King and...

238
00:12:47,674 --> 00:12:48,674
Shazaam.

239
00:12:51,474 --> 00:12:53,514
Any idea who
the shooter was?

240
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:56,153
Specifically?
I don't know.

241
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,753
But, I'm sure they're
looking for us, too.

242
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:03,912
All right, just an idea, let's divvy up the
cash and split.

243
00:13:04,232 --> 00:13:06,712
Excuse me. Are you new?
Is that the thing? Is he new?

244
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:09,791
Miles, this guy holds a grudge better than
my ex-mother-in-law.

245
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:13,351
You remember that Moshe Macelli? That
Jew-Italian guy from Boston?

246
00:13:13,431 --> 00:13:16,190
They used to call him Matzo Mazzarelli?
Remember that?

247
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,070
The guy with the face spaz?

248
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,190
It's called a facial twitch, Miles.

249
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,549
And the guy was not
born like that, you know.

250
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:27,429
Five years ago, Matzo was turf-fixing for
the King at Santa Anita,

251
00:13:27,469 --> 00:13:29,668
and he skimmed two grand
before skipping town.

252
00:13:29,748 --> 00:13:32,668
Five years later King
finally catches up to him,

253
00:13:32,748 --> 00:13:36,227
keeps him chained in his fucking bathroom
for like five days.

254
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:37,627
Oh, God.

255
00:13:37,707 --> 00:13:41,307
Now just say the word King,
and he spits up all over himself.

256
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,906
- Jesus!
- Pathetic.

257
00:13:42,986 --> 00:13:46,226
Even words like Vi-king and
shrin-king, they set the guy off.

258
00:13:47,866 --> 00:13:50,585
That's a five-year grudge
over $2000.

259
00:13:50,665 --> 00:13:52,865
So we go talk to him.

260
00:13:52,945 --> 00:13:55,305
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
You wanna give the money back?

261
00:13:55,345 --> 00:13:57,304
- I didn't say that.
- Pittsburgh.

262
00:13:57,384 --> 00:13:59,264
Madrone.

263
00:13:59,304 --> 00:14:01,024
Pittsburgh is where
it's happening.

264
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:07,103
Bird flew into my
house last night, too.

265
00:14:09,423 --> 00:14:11,302
Not a good sign, Gordo.

266
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:19,501
Jake:
The Euclid was our place.

267
00:14:19,581 --> 00:14:22,581
Gordo fleeced the deed off
some jack-off in a card game.

268
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:26,420
We used it every now and then for
a rag, but mostly it was our office.

269
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,420
Our power point.

270
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,579
What are you doing?

271
00:14:31,619 --> 00:14:33,459
Where the hell's that going?

272
00:14:47,497 --> 00:14:50,617
- We want insurance?
- Jesus Christ, Miles.

273
00:14:50,697 --> 00:14:52,536
I'm just asking.

274
00:14:54,216 --> 00:14:56,296
Just mail it.

275
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:01,335
Yeah, I'm looking
for the King, please.

276
00:15:02,495 --> 00:15:04,375
Just tell him it's regarding
an accounting problem.

277
00:15:05,374 --> 00:15:07,254
Yeah, he'll know.

278
00:15:10,054 --> 00:15:12,293
Hollywood and Vine?
Okay.

279
00:15:12,373 --> 00:15:14,573
- When?
- Two hours from now.

280
00:15:14,653 --> 00:15:17,493
- But just me.
- Fuck that. We're going too.

281
00:15:17,573 --> 00:15:20,892
Let's all just put our dicks back in our
pants for a second, okay?

282
00:15:20,932 --> 00:15:24,532
Is this the best
thing to do, Jake?

283
00:15:24,572 --> 00:15:27,211
How do you know the King
is going to let you walk, Jake?

284
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,331
'Cause I'm getting a ride.

285
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,290
Don't be dicking around
in there, okay?

286
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,890
And if he shoots you or stabs you or
causes you to bleed profusely,

287
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,409
call a cab, 'cause your ass
ain't getting back in here.

288
00:15:41,489 --> 00:15:42,929
Thanks, guys.

289
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:46,128
We appreciate your punctuality.
Mr. King is expecting you.

290
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,368
Lupus!

291
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:52,368
You said to pat him down,
so I'm patting him down.

292
00:15:52,448 --> 00:15:54,847
It only takes a
moment to be polite.

293
00:15:54,927 --> 00:15:57,967
My apology, Mr. Vig.
If you wouldn't mind?

294
00:16:01,206 --> 00:16:03,686
- So you the guy that got Big Al?
- Nope.

295
00:16:03,766 --> 00:16:05,806
Mr. King farms out
that kind of work. Please.

296
00:16:06,805 --> 00:16:08,365
After you.

297
00:16:21,883 --> 00:16:23,843
Wait with the ladies.

298
00:16:24,923 --> 00:16:26,283
Harlin.

299
00:16:26,323 --> 00:16:28,762
Okay, now you see
that right there?

300
00:16:28,842 --> 00:16:32,562
Find out who she is. Make a note.
I think it's channel 42 or 3.

301
00:16:32,602 --> 00:16:35,801
- A little harder.
- The girls are here and the kid.

302
00:16:35,881 --> 00:16:37,721
Also got the Seldin brothers
with a shipment.

303
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:38,921
- Bring them in.
- Which?

304
00:16:39,001 --> 00:16:41,160
- Whatever.
- The brothers, the girl or the kid?

305
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,280
Oh that's good. Whoever. Come on. I'm
getting a massage, Harlin.

306
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,840
You got it, boss.

307
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,719
Jake, ladies.

308
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,919
Harlin, I think I bet that dog.

309
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,319
Go! Go! Go!

310
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:54,519
Hey.

311
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:56,638
Well, look it here.

312
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,998
- Hi, girls.
- Girls: Hi.

313
00:17:01,038 --> 00:17:02,917
So, are you two together?

314
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:04,597
We're sisters.

315
00:17:04,677 --> 00:17:06,717
I like sisters!

316
00:17:08,117 --> 00:17:10,276
Jake, I can't quite see.
Why don't you move a little bit,

317
00:17:10,316 --> 00:17:12,236
so that I can check them out
then you can check them out?

318
00:17:12,276 --> 00:17:13,876
Thanks.

319
00:17:13,956 --> 00:17:16,035
- Sisters, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

320
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:18,235
- And you're over 18?
- Yeah.

321
00:17:20,355 --> 00:17:22,874
Harlin, let's see
what the sisters can do.

322
00:17:22,954 --> 00:17:25,154
- Put them in the booth.
- Ladies.

323
00:17:26,154 --> 00:17:28,514
Harlin: Oh, by the way,
he had an escort.

324
00:17:28,554 --> 00:17:29,553
LAPD.

325
00:17:30,993 --> 00:17:33,753
That's a little overreacting,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

326
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,352
It's just a little insurance,
that's all.

327
00:17:36,392 --> 00:17:39,392
Uh-huh.
So, they're on the take for you.

328
00:17:39,432 --> 00:17:43,031
Shh. You must be pretty good if
you got cops driving you around.

329
00:17:43,111 --> 00:17:45,111
Is that because
you look so innocent,

330
00:17:45,191 --> 00:17:47,071
and you're kind of cute there
aren't you?

331
00:17:48,391 --> 00:17:50,190
Yeah, it's something like that.

332
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,150
So what do you do, tiger?

333
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,030
You just con people
out of their money?

334
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,589
There is actually
some technique to it.

335
00:17:58,589 --> 00:18:01,429
You mean, like... style.

336
00:18:01,509 --> 00:18:03,708
Yeah, it helps,
don't you think?

337
00:18:03,788 --> 00:18:06,268
No, style is at the end of my list,
I'll tell you why,

338
00:18:06,308 --> 00:18:08,228
when I was a young man like you
just starting out,

339
00:18:08,268 --> 00:18:10,107
my first big score,
this guy we robbed.

340
00:18:10,147 --> 00:18:12,947
I think his name was...
Chinatown Schmidt!

341
00:18:13,027 --> 00:18:15,627
It was nothing big,
my end was about $800.

342
00:18:15,707 --> 00:18:18,266
The first thing I did, I go out
and get myself a suit, right?

343
00:18:18,346 --> 00:18:20,226
Yeah, I looked good.
It was like white.

344
00:18:20,306 --> 00:18:23,346
It was white.
It was white white.

345
00:18:23,426 --> 00:18:26,025
White, white, white, white, white!

346
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,985
Oh, I looked good, man.

347
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,425
I walked down the street,
everybody was checking me out.

348
00:18:30,465 --> 00:18:33,584
- Male and female.
- I'm sure they did.

349
00:18:34,624 --> 00:18:36,544
Anyway, the first day I wore it out,

350
00:18:36,584 --> 00:18:37,903
October, it was still hot out.

351
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:41,023
We were kicking back in Malibu
and Chinatown Schmidt, right?

352
00:18:41,103 --> 00:18:43,663
He catches up with us, so two guys
roll by and boom, boom, boom, boom!

353
00:18:43,743 --> 00:18:45,622
Boom, boom, boom, boom!

354
00:18:45,662 --> 00:18:48,462
Six of us, scatter, man.
The dust settles.

355
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:50,422
Everybody's checking
their fingers and their toes.

356
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,861
And who is the one guy
that got hit, sailor?

357
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,421
You know why?

358
00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:59,380
White suit!

359
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,660
I was the first thing they saw,
I was the first thing they aimed at.

360
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,620
I was the first thing they hit.

361
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,139
So what did I learn
that day, Jake?

362
00:19:07,219 --> 00:19:09,099
Don't wear white
after Labor Day, maybe?

363
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:12,778
No. Sometimes, Jake,

364
00:19:12,858 --> 00:19:15,298
style can get you killed.

365
00:19:20,217 --> 00:19:23,177
Harlin: Mr. King,
the girls are ready!

366
00:19:23,257 --> 00:19:25,217
Oh great! Wait, sport,
you're gonna love this.

367
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:28,336
- You ever been here before?
- No, it's not really my thing.

368
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,296
Oh, you don't know that.
Tuesday we got Disco Night,

369
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,216
Wednesday is that
electronic music shit,

370
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,615
Thursdays are
Gay and Lesbian Night.

371
00:19:33,695 --> 00:19:36,055
That is very tasteful, by the way.
Ow! Ow! Ow!

372
00:19:37,095 --> 00:19:39,214
Lupus, I want you
to get me... Lupus!

373
00:19:39,254 --> 00:19:42,814
Goddamn it, you're looking at them
or you're working for me?

374
00:19:42,894 --> 00:19:45,454
I want you to get me an espresso,
please, and tell that bitch

375
00:19:45,534 --> 00:19:47,533
to give me back my slippy dips.
Come on. Now!

376
00:19:47,613 --> 00:19:49,573
Let me ask you something,
why one of my guys?

377
00:19:49,653 --> 00:19:51,213
Why Lionel Dolby?

378
00:19:51,253 --> 00:19:53,652
My six-year-old nephew could con
anything out of that dude. Why?

379
00:19:53,732 --> 00:19:55,852
Look, if we knew Dolby
was connected to you,

380
00:19:55,932 --> 00:19:58,892
we'd never have gone near him, so
I apologize for any inconvenience.

381
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:01,211
Honest mistake,
all right?

382
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:04,331
It's just something between two guys
that don't know each other yet.

383
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:06,411
So we're gonna make
an exchange of the money

384
00:20:06,491 --> 00:20:08,650
and all will be forgiven.
Isn't that right?

385
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,130
- No. That I won't do.
- Won't?

386
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,529
You won't.
You won't.

387
00:20:15,569 --> 00:20:19,169
I want you to look very hard at me,
motherfucker, and tell me why.

388
00:20:20,209 --> 00:20:22,648
Let me rephrase that.
That I can't do.

389
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:26,848
Because A, I don't have the money,
and B, you killed one of my guys.

390
00:20:26,928 --> 00:20:29,047
One of your guys.
That's four-spot, right?

391
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:31,007
- Yeah.
- Four.

392
00:20:31,087 --> 00:20:33,207
One of your guys, huh?

393
00:20:33,287 --> 00:20:35,286
I gotta take a pill,
or I'm all over the place.

394
00:20:38,006 --> 00:20:40,246
- This is confidential, right?
- Yeah.

395
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:42,645
Mm! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

396
00:20:42,725 --> 00:20:45,085
Hey, stop it!
Stop that right now!

397
00:20:45,165 --> 00:20:47,804
They can't hear me. Harlin,
get them outta there, Goddamn it.

398
00:20:47,884 --> 00:20:50,524
Down! Down! Shit, man.

399
00:20:50,604 --> 00:20:52,484
How do you like that?
They're sisters.

400
00:20:52,524 --> 00:20:55,923
Let me ask you something.
I want a straight answer now.

401
00:20:56,003 --> 00:20:58,803
You did not know
that Dolby was connected to me?

402
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:01,203
- You heard me before.
- But it's so important

403
00:21:01,283 --> 00:21:04,122
that you don't stray from the truth
in this one little part.

404
00:21:05,322 --> 00:21:06,482
I didn't know.

405
00:21:07,762 --> 00:21:09,921
You're a good grifter, man.

406
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:11,681
It's hard to tell when you're lying.

407
00:21:11,761 --> 00:21:15,520
But I'm getting there.
Come here, girls.

408
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,000
Now listen, it's the first time
I've ever put girls in the booth.

409
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,640
Usually, they work their way up.

410
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,199
You're gonna go work on your routine,
you know why?

411
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:25,159
Because you're saying
that you are sisters.

412
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:26,799
- Mm-mm, We are sisters.
- Shh.

413
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:27,799
- We're very close.
- Let me talk. Let me talk.

414
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:30,358
- You don't like what we're doing?
- Of course I like what you're doing

415
00:21:30,438 --> 00:21:32,958
but I like it done
with artistry, with grace,

416
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:35,038
and that means,
if you're gonna eat each other,

417
00:21:35,118 --> 00:21:38,397
you must find a way
to do it tastefully, okay?

418
00:21:38,437 --> 00:21:40,957
These are people here,
they've got families, all right?

419
00:21:40,997 --> 00:21:43,436
- Okay.
- You understand? Then go work!

420
00:21:43,516 --> 00:21:46,116
- Go on. Go on!
- Ladies.

421
00:21:46,196 --> 00:21:47,996
Tell me this,

422
00:21:48,036 --> 00:21:49,955
how are you and I
gonna resolve our shit?

423
00:21:51,235 --> 00:21:53,035
I get you what I owe you,

424
00:21:53,115 --> 00:21:55,675
plus interest,
by going on the grift for you.

425
00:21:55,755 --> 00:21:59,234
I like that. Okay, sit down.
Put your baby cakes down here,

426
00:21:59,314 --> 00:22:01,234
that cute little
Irish muscle ass you got.

427
00:22:01,314 --> 00:22:03,753
Look, I came here
to do a deal,

428
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,713
not play grab-ass with you,
you freak, all right?

429
00:22:05,793 --> 00:22:07,073
- Humor.
- You heard my proposal

430
00:22:07,153 --> 00:22:10,472
- Humor, Jake, junior,
buster, humor. Come on.

431
00:22:10,552 --> 00:22:12,432
You wanna get out of here
I gotta open up the place.

432
00:22:12,512 --> 00:22:16,072
Come on, sit down.
Business. Come on.

433
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:19,831
All right. Here's what l...

434
00:22:21,471 --> 00:22:24,910
- you don't want to sit closer?
- No, I'm fine over here, thank you.

435
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,990
All right.

436
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,829
Can I see your hand?

437
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:34,269
You got a big hand. Let me see
your hand, I'm not gonna bite you.

438
00:22:34,349 --> 00:22:36,549
Look at that hand, man.
You should have been a pianist,

439
00:22:36,629 --> 00:22:38,508
or a guitarist,
look at the size of that.

440
00:22:38,588 --> 00:22:40,788
Wow. See this?

441
00:22:40,828 --> 00:22:42,708
That's your love line.
That's your money line.

442
00:22:42,748 --> 00:22:44,467
And that's looking very very good.

443
00:22:44,547 --> 00:22:46,827
And that's your life line,
going all the way down...

444
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,867
Uh-oh.

445
00:22:48,947 --> 00:22:50,827
You see that little gap there.

446
00:22:51,826 --> 00:22:54,906
It means that at one point
you could have a little trouble.

447
00:22:54,986 --> 00:22:57,066
But it's up to you
to make it better.

448
00:23:00,185 --> 00:23:03,225
I want you to talk to me
and I want you to make me happy.

449
00:23:03,305 --> 00:23:05,344
And I don't want you to scare me.

450
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,464
You do not want to scare me, junior.

451
00:23:10,424 --> 00:23:12,463
What's gonna happen, now?

452
00:23:12,503 --> 00:23:15,823
I play a con.
You get a cut, I get a cut.

453
00:23:15,863 --> 00:23:17,223
We get square.

454
00:23:17,303 --> 00:23:21,662
And I give you the who
and you give me the how, right?

455
00:23:21,742 --> 00:23:23,742
And you can
because you're so good, right?

456
00:23:23,822 --> 00:23:25,382
I like to think so.

457
00:23:25,462 --> 00:23:27,981
Okay, you're gonna do this
with Morgan Price.

458
00:23:30,021 --> 00:23:31,501
- Morgan Price?
- Yes.

459
00:23:31,581 --> 00:23:32,540
- Impossible.
- Why?

460
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,500
'Cause you can't get to him.
He's too big.

461
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,660
You got to me.

462
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,900
- Yeah, but we got to you because...
- What?

463
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:41,819
- You were a fluke, a mistake.

464
00:23:43,459 --> 00:23:45,219
That's a good answer.

465
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:48,178
- Why Morgan Price?
- 'Cause he's very important to me.

466
00:23:48,258 --> 00:23:49,338
Lupus!

467
00:23:49,418 --> 00:23:52,178
Don't fuck with me, junior,
okay? Lupus!

468
00:23:52,258 --> 00:23:53,417
You know what?

469
00:23:53,497 --> 00:23:56,577
You're gonna take
my friend Lupus with you, okay?

470
00:23:56,657 --> 00:23:59,017
Absolutely not,
that's not the way I operate.

471
00:23:59,057 --> 00:24:00,896
- Shh.
- I work with my guys.

472
00:24:01,936 --> 00:24:03,816
You're gonna take Lupus with you.

473
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:05,776
That's the way I operate.

474
00:24:07,535 --> 00:24:10,535
Look at me, now.
Tell me we're set.

475
00:24:13,175 --> 00:24:15,134
- Yeah. We're set.
- Good.

476
00:24:16,814 --> 00:24:18,374
We're done
with all this business now?

477
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,053
The rest of it
depends on you.

478
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:22,733
I think I'm done.

479
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:35,651
* Erotica *

480
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:37,611
* Romance *

481
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,690
* Erotica *

482
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,650
* Romance *

483
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:51,649
* My name is Dita *

484
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:53,609
* I'll be your mistress tonight *

485
00:24:55,688 --> 00:24:58,848
* I'd like to put you
in a trance... *

486
00:25:00,288 --> 00:25:03,687
Excuse me, miss? Miss!

487
00:25:03,767 --> 00:25:05,647
I think you dropped something.

488
00:25:06,647 --> 00:25:08,726
You know you're good,
but you're not that good.

489
00:25:08,806 --> 00:25:10,686
I spotted that lift
from across the club.

490
00:25:13,246 --> 00:25:14,726
Wait?
You don't recognize me?

491
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:17,285
- Tony, could you get my car?
- Sure!

492
00:25:17,365 --> 00:25:19,605
You really don't remember me,
do you?

493
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,885
Should I?

494
00:25:24,324 --> 00:25:26,204
Oh, right.

495
00:25:27,404 --> 00:25:29,283
That's good.

496
00:25:29,363 --> 00:25:31,923
So, you're interested
in a little work?

497
00:25:32,003 --> 00:25:34,043
You couldn't afford me.

498
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:36,402
Not with $27

499
00:25:36,482 --> 00:25:38,842
and a maxed-out Visa, John.

500
00:25:38,922 --> 00:25:41,122
Or is it Tom or Bill?

501
00:25:41,202 --> 00:25:43,081
Hard to tell
with so many IDs.

502
00:25:43,161 --> 00:25:45,121
Yeah, well, the name's Jake.

503
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:47,321
And don't flatter yourself, sweetheart.

504
00:25:47,401 --> 00:25:49,321
That's one thing
I never had to pay for,

505
00:25:49,401 --> 00:25:51,320
and I don't consider it work.

506
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,840
Guess you got
the wrong girl then.

507
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,839
Do me a favor,
take a deep breath and count to 10.

508
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:02,079
I'm talking about a grift,
and it pays well.

509
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,078
Unless you think
you're gonna get rich

510
00:26:04,158 --> 00:26:06,038
jerking off geriatrics
in that place.

511
00:26:06,078 --> 00:26:07,998
I didn't know you cared.

512
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:11,277
Keep the wallet.

513
00:26:11,357 --> 00:26:13,237
We're even.

514
00:26:13,277 --> 00:26:15,277
Take a deep breath,

515
00:26:15,357 --> 00:26:18,316
count to 10, and...

516
00:26:19,116 --> 00:26:21,036
go fuck yourself!

517
00:26:25,595 --> 00:26:28,475
Look, it pays well.

518
00:26:28,555 --> 00:26:30,595
Six figures.

519
00:26:31,634 --> 00:26:33,554
All you gotta do
is play a part,

520
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,154
do a little acting.

521
00:26:35,234 --> 00:26:37,154
You think
you can handle that?

522
00:26:37,234 --> 00:26:39,673
Why me?
You don't even know me.

523
00:26:39,753 --> 00:26:42,393
'Cause what I've seen, I liked.

524
00:26:42,473 --> 00:26:44,512
And I got
a good feeling about you.

525
00:26:46,232 --> 00:26:49,032
Hasn't anyone ever
said that to you before?

526
00:26:52,431 --> 00:26:54,431
No.

527
00:26:55,671 --> 00:26:57,591
- Thanks, Tony.
- You bet!

528
00:26:57,631 --> 00:26:59,630
But, I'll think about it.

529
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,910
All right, I think
it will be worth your while.

530
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,110
Make a wish.

531
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:07,269
11:11, make a wish.

532
00:27:10,069 --> 00:27:11,948
That's twice!

533
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:18,907
- I can see why you liked her.
- Yeah, I liked her a lot.

534
00:27:18,987 --> 00:27:21,227
And that was it, we had our crew.

535
00:27:21,267 --> 00:27:23,947
Now all we needed was the con.

536
00:27:24,027 --> 00:27:26,186
Miles:
Bottoms. Oh...

537
00:27:26,226 --> 00:27:29,506
- Oh well.
- Shit!

538
00:27:29,586 --> 00:27:30,786
What's up, guys?

539
00:27:31,786 --> 00:27:32,985
Who's the mope?

540
00:27:33,065 --> 00:27:34,945
This is Lupus.

541
00:27:35,025 --> 00:27:37,385
He works with the King and now
he's gonna be part of our crew.

542
00:27:37,465 --> 00:27:39,624
I'm here to make sure
things go smoothly.

543
00:27:39,704 --> 00:27:42,424
Woman:
Anybody got a light?

544
00:27:42,504 --> 00:27:45,064
And this is Lily.

545
00:27:47,543 --> 00:27:49,983
She's the new shill
I was telling you about.

546
00:27:50,063 --> 00:27:52,183
- Whoa.
- Gordo: Whoa, whoa, whoa...

547
00:27:52,263 --> 00:27:54,422
Hold the fucking phone,
what is this?

548
00:27:54,502 --> 00:27:57,462
Are we playing a con, or are we doing a
rendition of "Our Town"?

549
00:27:57,542 --> 00:28:01,061
Gordo, trust me.
We need the help on this one.

550
00:28:01,101 --> 00:28:03,941
Our new mark?
Morgan Price.

551
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,260
Why?

552
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,339
Because, that's who the King
wants us to fleece.

553
00:28:14,379 --> 00:28:16,699
And besides,
the price is perfect.

554
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:19,299
I'm not supposed to wait for you,
you're supposed to wait for me.

555
00:28:19,379 --> 00:28:21,378
Jake: His old man
was a big time mob attorney.

556
00:28:21,418 --> 00:28:24,498
Which makes him
a second generation crook.

557
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:27,577
When he dropped dead, Price
carried on the family tradition,

558
00:28:27,657 --> 00:28:30,817
by opening a one-stop shopping center for
money laundering

559
00:28:30,857 --> 00:28:32,937
and low interest corporate fraud.

560
00:28:33,017 --> 00:28:33,977
Well, fuck him!

561
00:28:34,057 --> 00:28:36,936
Almost $1 billion gets washed
through his shop every year,

562
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:39,416
so we know
he's got the money.

563
00:28:39,496 --> 00:28:41,215
It's just a matter
of getting to it.

564
00:28:41,295 --> 00:28:43,655
How much
are we going after?

565
00:28:45,495 --> 00:28:46,935
$5 million.

566
00:28:50,294 --> 00:28:52,854
- We can only hold the King at 150.
- I know.

567
00:28:52,934 --> 00:28:54,773
That's why we don't go
after him directly.

568
00:28:55,773 --> 00:28:58,253
First, we find a doable mark
in Price's bank,

569
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:00,213
a mid-level employee.

570
00:29:00,293 --> 00:29:03,292
We meet him with papers,
inquiring about a corporate loan.

571
00:29:03,372 --> 00:29:05,972
Our guy then fudges numbers
in the right places.

572
00:29:06,052 --> 00:29:08,931
Moves our papers to the top
of the pile or to the bottom,

573
00:29:09,011 --> 00:29:11,291
depending upon what we need.

574
00:29:11,331 --> 00:29:13,091
Our loan is approved.

575
00:29:13,171 --> 00:29:14,811
On the given day,

576
00:29:14,851 --> 00:29:18,130
the money's wired into a corporate
account in an offshore bank.

577
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,970
That same day, I show up
in Belize with the proper ID,

578
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,409
and corporate papers
to make the withdrawal.

579
00:29:23,489 --> 00:29:25,889
- Um-mm.
- What? What is it, Miles?

580
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:27,809
I'm just thinking
out loud here...

581
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,288
but $5 million
in a briefcase?

582
00:29:32,728 --> 00:29:34,168
Good point.

583
00:29:36,447 --> 00:29:39,367
Jake: It's bank policy not
to release this money in cash,

584
00:29:39,447 --> 00:29:41,527
'cause it's under
a corporate account.

585
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:44,326
So we then cash the check
at another bank.

586
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,886
Any major airport's
gonna be too hard to control.

587
00:29:48,966 --> 00:29:51,805
LAX is out.
So we use Ontario.

588
00:29:51,885 --> 00:29:54,165
Mid-level hub
with direct international flights.

589
00:29:54,205 --> 00:29:57,364
40 minutes outside LA.
This is the most important part,

590
00:29:57,444 --> 00:29:59,924
you can't just walk
into the United States

591
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,284
with a suitcase full of cash,

592
00:30:01,364 --> 00:30:04,083
without evoking the words
"cavity search."

593
00:30:04,123 --> 00:30:07,683
That's why we need someone
on the inside at Customs.

594
00:30:11,162 --> 00:30:15,602
Then we disappear.

595
00:30:20,761 --> 00:30:23,920
Now this might just be me,
but that is hands down

596
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,080
the dumbest fucking idea
I've ever heard.

597
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,240
Gordo:
People have tried this before, Jake.

598
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,800
It's never worked.

599
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,719
Teddy Fraiser and his crew
got nailed in Vancouver last year.

600
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:34,719
It's never worked before,

601
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,519
because, A,
they didn't flush the bank enough,

602
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:38,718
B, their corporate papers
were for shit,

603
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:40,398
and C, unlike us,

604
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:42,438
they did not have somebody
on the inside at Customs.

605
00:30:42,518 --> 00:30:44,717
Yeah, or D,
it's a dumb fucking idea!

606
00:30:44,797 --> 00:30:45,917
Hey!

607
00:30:47,557 --> 00:30:51,237
What do you fucking suggest,
Miles? You wanna run?

608
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:53,036
We never had
a problem with that, before.

609
00:30:53,076 --> 00:30:55,356
Jake: We never had
a fucking problem like this before.

610
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,916
Yes, we have, okay?

611
00:30:57,996 --> 00:30:59,515
And we would have been
beautiful about it.

612
00:30:59,595 --> 00:31:01,475
We would have had
a bucket of fried chicken,

613
00:31:01,555 --> 00:31:02,915
delivered to the King with a nice

614
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:05,035
Kiss My Ass card attached to it,
and we would have moved on

615
00:31:05,074 --> 00:31:07,394
until the next
local putz caught on.

616
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:10,234
We're getting
too old to run, Miles.

617
00:31:10,314 --> 00:31:14,073
Yeah well, we're still
a little too young for San Quentin.

618
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:20,552
Look, I'm... I mean,
are you pissed off about Al?

619
00:31:20,592 --> 00:31:22,552
Look at me.

620
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:24,712
Trust me, I'm pissed too.

621
00:31:24,792 --> 00:31:27,351
But I'm not 25-to-life pissed.

622
00:31:31,351 --> 00:31:33,430
Look, I'm getting clear of this.

623
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,430
All right?

624
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,590
So if you don't want to do it
for the fucking principle,

625
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:41,909
do it for the money.
Gordo?

626
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:46,588
Yeah, Jake, whatever.

627
00:31:46,668 --> 00:31:48,388
There's no whatever with this one.

628
00:31:48,468 --> 00:31:50,828
You're either with me
or against me.

629
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:52,748
No third position.

630
00:31:54,107 --> 00:31:55,427
I'm in.

631
00:31:56,787 --> 00:31:58,787
Aw, what a relief.

632
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,066
Oh, fuck.

633
00:32:03,146 --> 00:32:05,026
Jake:
I agreed with Miles,

634
00:32:05,066 --> 00:32:07,905
it was hands down,
a dumb fucking idea.

635
00:32:07,945 --> 00:32:10,465
But they bought in,
now I had to deliver...

636
00:32:10,505 --> 00:32:11,945
- Yeah, it's Vig.
- And I needed help.

637
00:32:12,465 --> 00:32:14,344
Cop #1: What are we gonna do
with this stuff? I mean, heroin.

638
00:32:14,384 --> 00:32:16,544
- What do you do with heroin?
- You sell it.

639
00:32:16,624 --> 00:32:19,064
- To who?
- Don't be a knucklehead.

640
00:32:19,144 --> 00:32:21,623
Cop #2: How hard do you think it is
to sell one drug dealer's drugs

641
00:32:21,703 --> 00:32:22,623
to another drug dealer?

642
00:32:22,703 --> 00:32:26,143
If Vig is right,
we're looking at 100, 150.

643
00:32:26,183 --> 00:32:28,782
You think it's a good idea?
We never done this shit before.

644
00:32:28,862 --> 00:32:32,182
Well, what is he gonna do,
file a missing drug report?

645
00:32:32,262 --> 00:32:35,261
Hey if it works out, we could turn the guy
over a few times.

646
00:32:35,341 --> 00:32:38,061
I hope so, bro'. I took my daughter
to the orthodontist, yesterday.

647
00:32:38,141 --> 00:32:40,021
150 bucks to tighten
those bitches up.

648
00:32:40,101 --> 00:32:41,980
Took him five minutes.
Then he said it wasn't even covered.

649
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,020
It's cosmetic.
The plan doesn't cover cosmetic.

650
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,860
I had a cap put in here, right?

651
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,099
My fucking dentist tells me,
"You're not covered for that."

652
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:50,419
Bullshit cosmetics!

653
00:32:50,499 --> 00:32:53,419
I got a freaking tooth
split in half here, all right?

654
00:32:53,499 --> 00:32:55,538
Write that shit in
as a cavity or something.

655
00:32:55,618 --> 00:32:57,018
- Did he?
- Yeah, he did.

656
00:32:57,098 --> 00:32:59,498
Fucking department
got the bullshit dental plan.

657
00:33:01,418 --> 00:33:03,497
That's our man, right there.
Red bag, right?

658
00:33:03,577 --> 00:33:06,097
- Is that the guy?
- Let's go.

659
00:33:07,657 --> 00:33:10,136
Hands up!
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

660
00:33:11,496 --> 00:33:13,496
- What the fuck you got?
- Get on the ground.

661
00:33:13,576 --> 00:33:15,455
- So, how did you get caught?

662
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,775
Tommy Suits used to say
that in any con,

663
00:33:17,855 --> 00:33:21,455
sooner or later somebody's gonna
start asking the right questions.

664
00:33:21,535 --> 00:33:24,294
Usually, it takes a little longer.

665
00:33:24,374 --> 00:33:26,414
Gordo: Am I the only one who feels like we
can't make a move,

666
00:33:26,494 --> 00:33:27,934
with this guy on us?
I think we should ditch him.

667
00:33:28,014 --> 00:33:31,053
Jake: No, we need him and dummy up.
Here he comes.

668
00:33:31,133 --> 00:33:33,653
Gordo:
Ah, here he is. Hey, hey.

669
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:37,252
How's the hoop, superstar? Clean?

670
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:42,851
What the fuck is it with you
and bathrooms, huh? Tell me.

671
00:33:42,931 --> 00:33:45,371
Miles: Hey, he can't use a restroom
unless he knows it's clean.

672
00:33:45,451 --> 00:33:48,051
- What's the matter with that?
- Manly, all right, wise guy?

673
00:33:48,091 --> 00:33:50,010
That's cute.

674
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:53,370
You know this is
a major metropolitan city, brother.

675
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,570
Public sanitation
does not run very high

676
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,529
on the City Hall agenda.

677
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:00,369
You know what you can get
off a toilet seat or a doorknob?

678
00:34:01,529 --> 00:34:03,049
You wanna run down the list?

679
00:34:03,129 --> 00:34:05,008
Hepatitis.
You ever hear of that?

680
00:34:05,048 --> 00:34:07,368
Influenza.
The fucking flesh-eating disease.

681
00:34:07,448 --> 00:34:10,048
- I'm eating.
- Yeah, we noticed.

682
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:12,007
Do you need a shovel
down there, dear?

683
00:34:14,127 --> 00:34:16,207
Gordo, Gordo.
That's enough, all right?

684
00:34:16,247 --> 00:34:18,406
We gotta get down
to business, here. Miles!

685
00:34:18,486 --> 00:34:21,286
We're gonna need you to find us
a mark inside of Price's bank.

686
00:34:21,366 --> 00:34:24,165
Somebody we can work with.
Gordo, we're gonna need papers.

687
00:34:24,245 --> 00:34:26,725
Corporate insurance,
a letter of intent, the whole nine.

688
00:34:26,805 --> 00:34:28,205
- All fugazze?
- No, no, no

689
00:34:28,285 --> 00:34:30,165
Corporate papers
have got to be legit.

690
00:34:30,245 --> 00:34:33,484
We're all gonna need new IDs.
You gotta make sure they're clean.

691
00:34:33,564 --> 00:34:35,364
Go talk to Suits,
and he'll hook you up.

692
00:34:35,444 --> 00:34:37,923
- What about Customs?
- Don't worry about Customs,

693
00:34:38,003 --> 00:34:39,323
I'll take care of that.

694
00:34:39,403 --> 00:34:41,283
We're gonna need
some start-up cash, first.

695
00:34:42,323 --> 00:34:44,203
Lupus, you think the King
would be willing to bank us?

696
00:34:45,202 --> 00:34:47,082
You already owe him.

697
00:34:48,202 --> 00:34:49,522
Lupus,
we need a banker for this.

698
00:34:49,602 --> 00:34:51,242
We can't do this job
without a banker.

699
00:34:51,282 --> 00:34:53,201
- Gordo, do we need a banker?
- I think so, yes.

700
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:56,161
- Jake: I think we need a banker.
- I don't know, man

701
00:34:56,241 --> 00:34:58,440
- You could try.
- He's not gonna listen to me.

702
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,920
I bet if you talk to him,
loosen him up,

703
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,560
- maybe he'll listen to you.
- All right! I'll try, okay?

704
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,519
Don't do us any favors,
all right?

705
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:07,439
Jesus, join the team!

706
00:35:10,279 --> 00:35:12,238
So, you guys are good?
You know what you need to do?

707
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,678
- Yeah.
- All right!

708
00:35:13,758 --> 00:35:15,838
Lupus, Lily, we'll go over
to see the King, now.

709
00:35:15,918 --> 00:35:18,078
- All right!
- Jake: Ready to roll?

710
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:20,037
Let's do it.

711
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:22,917
I'm not finished.

712
00:35:26,316 --> 00:35:28,876
She's not finished.

713
00:35:28,956 --> 00:35:30,876
Gordo: What's wrong with you?
Where's your manners?

714
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:35,435
Nice!
You know why?

715
00:35:35,515 --> 00:35:37,395
Because it's real.
You're licking each other.

716
00:35:37,475 --> 00:35:38,915
- Feels good?
- Feels so good.

717
00:35:38,995 --> 00:35:40,714
All right, that's it...
what? What, what?

718
00:35:40,794 --> 00:35:41,714
Jake is here,

719
00:35:41,794 --> 00:35:43,794
He wants you to stake him
a couple hundred grand.

720
00:35:43,874 --> 00:35:45,754
No, he's supposed to be getting me
money, not costing me money.

721
00:35:45,834 --> 00:35:47,833
He says we need it.
And I gotta say, boss,

722
00:35:47,913 --> 00:35:50,273
- this guy's pretty sharp, you know?
- Look at me, look at me.

723
00:35:50,353 --> 00:35:52,233
- You're getting a crush on him?
- What are you talking about?

724
00:35:52,313 --> 00:35:54,072
Don't let him get into your head, 'cause
he's a charmer.

725
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,672
You tell him to wait a minute
and then you bring him in.

726
00:35:56,752 --> 00:35:58,672
He's right behind you.

727
00:35:58,752 --> 00:36:00,831
Get outta here.
Get outta here.

728
00:36:00,871 --> 00:36:03,391
You're starting
to scare me, sport. Harlin!

729
00:36:04,391 --> 00:36:06,391
200K?
Isn't that more than you owe me?

730
00:36:06,471 --> 00:36:08,350
Jake: You're just gonna have
to trust me on this, all right?

731
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,990
Oh, no.
You're a day late on trust.

732
00:36:13,989 --> 00:36:17,069
I think that what he's trying
to say is that he'Il...

733
00:36:17,149 --> 00:36:19,789
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

734
00:36:19,869 --> 00:36:22,588
You brought her for a reason,
didn't you, booster?

735
00:36:22,628 --> 00:36:24,508
Let's listen to her.

736
00:36:24,548 --> 00:36:27,467
No, why don't you listen up?

737
00:36:27,547 --> 00:36:29,867
Even though I'm running
the show for you,

738
00:36:29,947 --> 00:36:31,627
I'm still running the show.

739
00:36:31,707 --> 00:36:32,987
So we're gonna put an end to

740
00:36:33,027 --> 00:36:37,546
the scooter- junior-skippy-sport-
tiger-booster bullshit.

741
00:36:37,626 --> 00:36:39,506
The name is Jake.

742
00:36:41,945 --> 00:36:43,825
What do you say you get
the ADD under control?

743
00:36:43,905 --> 00:36:45,865
You look me in the eye
when I'm talking to you.

744
00:36:45,945 --> 00:36:48,464
- What's your name, honey?
- Her name is Lily.

745
00:36:48,544 --> 00:36:52,344
Booster, have I ever
referred to you as honey?

746
00:36:52,424 --> 00:36:53,824
Have I, scooter?

747
00:36:53,904 --> 00:36:56,543
It's a common mistake that Jake
is making when he says ADD.

748
00:36:56,623 --> 00:36:58,943
What he really means is ADHD,

749
00:36:59,023 --> 00:37:01,463
for Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder, see?

750
00:37:01,543 --> 00:37:04,102
The important word is the H,

751
00:37:04,182 --> 00:37:05,862
Hyperactivity.
I don't understand,

752
00:37:05,942 --> 00:37:08,222
why do you let her do that
if you care about her?

753
00:37:08,302 --> 00:37:10,101
It's poison, see?

754
00:37:10,141 --> 00:37:12,301
Feel my heart.

755
00:37:12,381 --> 00:37:15,500
Go ahead. I bet it beats
twice as fast as yours.

756
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:18,420
- Go on feel it.
- I'm fine, thanks.

757
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,780
Oh, come on. Will you feel my heart?
I'm not gonna bite you.

758
00:37:23,739 --> 00:37:25,659
God, you feel good.

759
00:37:29,338 --> 00:37:31,618
Like a trip-hammer, right?

760
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,298
See? Much faster...

761
00:37:37,137 --> 00:37:39,017
than yours.

762
00:37:41,177 --> 00:37:43,536
Why am I enjoying this

763
00:37:43,576 --> 00:37:45,776
so much, Jake?

764
00:37:46,856 --> 00:37:48,176
Because

765
00:37:48,256 --> 00:37:50,215
I feel like she is

766
00:37:50,295 --> 00:37:51,535
too.

767
00:37:54,455 --> 00:37:56,974
I'm sorry,
I know that was tasteless, dear.

768
00:37:57,014 --> 00:38:00,414
I was just trying
to make a point to Jake, okay?

769
00:38:00,494 --> 00:38:02,974
What do you say you get
your ADD under control,

770
00:38:03,054 --> 00:38:04,293
and we get to the fucking point?

771
00:38:04,373 --> 00:38:07,333
Ooh, I think Jake is referring
to my medication,

772
00:38:07,413 --> 00:38:09,293
which I thought was confidential.

773
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:12,892
Jacob, come on, come on.

774
00:38:12,972 --> 00:38:14,652
You know why I take that stuff.

775
00:38:14,732 --> 00:38:16,612
Because if I don't, I become hyper,

776
00:38:16,692 --> 00:38:19,691
or primitive, right?
Or impulsive.

777
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:22,891
You never know when
I'm going to lose it.

778
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,890
Now listen to me, okay?

779
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,970
Hey!

780
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,249
I'm not a violent man.

781
00:38:31,329 --> 00:38:33,609
I like to think
I am above that, right?

782
00:38:33,689 --> 00:38:36,449
You took my money
and now you're asking for more.

783
00:38:36,529 --> 00:38:39,208
And I'm gonna give you... I'm gonna
give you what you're asking for,

784
00:38:39,288 --> 00:38:41,728
- which is, how much? Tell me again.
- 200.

785
00:38:42,728 --> 00:38:45,287
200, how much is that altogether?

786
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:48,607
Including what you took
from me the first time?

787
00:38:48,687 --> 00:38:50,567
350.

788
00:38:50,607 --> 00:38:52,806
Oh, that's very good,
you're smart, aren't you?

789
00:38:52,886 --> 00:38:55,606
You told me you were smart.
You're a smart, smart, smart guy!

790
00:38:55,686 --> 00:38:57,566
So be smarter, huh?

791
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:02,045
Don't get hurt.
Don't scare me.

792
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:05,404
You've got a good, healthy,
long life ahead of you.

793
00:39:05,484 --> 00:39:07,364
I like you,
now say, "We're set."

794
00:39:08,364 --> 00:39:10,724
- "We're set."
- Say it like you like me too.

795
00:39:10,804 --> 00:39:12,163
Come on, you can do it.

796
00:39:12,203 --> 00:39:15,003
Say, "we're set"
like you like me.

797
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:16,963
We're set.

798
00:39:18,443 --> 00:39:20,642
Okay, now I want you
to take your lovely,

799
00:39:20,722 --> 00:39:22,602
lovely lady home.

800
00:39:23,642 --> 00:39:26,401
Oh my God,
you're beautiful.

801
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:29,561
Let's go.

802
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,280
Don't you ever, ever

803
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,160
let anyone stand behind me,
without me knowing.

804
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,999
You hear me?
You understand me?

805
00:39:42,999 --> 00:39:44,919
Man: So the King
gave you the money.

806
00:39:44,999 --> 00:39:47,078
Jake: Now, we just needed
to find our guy in Price's bank.

807
00:39:47,158 --> 00:39:48,678
Jake: What you're looking for
in a mark

808
00:39:48,758 --> 00:39:51,158
is someone whose weaknesses
you can exploit.

809
00:39:51,238 --> 00:39:53,277
Michelle Strigo, loan officer.

810
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:55,237
Jake: Guy like me,
people like that,

811
00:39:55,317 --> 00:39:57,757
I tell you what you're looking for
without even meeting you.

812
00:39:57,837 --> 00:39:58,997
(woman screams)

813
00:39:59,077 --> 00:40:02,356
You fucking asshole!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

814
00:40:02,436 --> 00:40:04,356
You cocksucker!

815
00:40:05,956 --> 00:40:08,875
Jake: It's like a personal ad
you wear over your head.

816
00:40:08,955 --> 00:40:12,075
- She's not gonna work.
- You sure?

817
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:17,234
Jay Housler,
VP of international finance.

818
00:40:26,913 --> 00:40:28,792
No.

819
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:40,271
Leon Ashby,
VP of corporate loans.

820
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:45,550
What you're looking for in a mark
is someone who has nothing to lose.

821
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:48,469
No friends. No family. No life.

822
00:40:48,509 --> 00:40:50,909
You're looking for a guy
who doesn't own a rug.

823
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,829
Jake:
Oh yeah, he's perfect.

824
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:55,668
- Miles: You sure?
- Hey, I'm sure.

825
00:40:55,748 --> 00:40:56,668
Ashby was the right mark.

826
00:40:56,748 --> 00:40:59,948
Now I needed to see if Lily was
the right shill, so I tested her.

827
00:41:00,028 --> 00:41:01,668
One watch engraved,
"To Carolyn,

828
00:41:01,748 --> 00:41:03,867
Happy Graduation Counselor,
Love, Mom and Dad."

829
00:41:03,947 --> 00:41:05,827
- Good.
- One bracelet engraved,

830
00:41:05,907 --> 00:41:08,467
"To Annie,
Happy 25th Anniversary, Love, Tom."

831
00:41:08,547 --> 00:41:11,106
- Perfect!
- I'll be right back, Mr. Lewis.

832
00:41:11,186 --> 00:41:12,386
- Okay, thank you.

833
00:41:12,466 --> 00:41:14,346
Excuse me, I think you have
something on hold for me.

834
00:41:14,426 --> 00:41:17,545
- Do you have a ticket?
- I lost it but the name is Hanson.

835
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:20,065
- Okay
- Thanks a lot.

836
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:22,664
- Mr. Lewis, right?
- Yes?

837
00:41:22,744 --> 00:41:26,224
- Jake Hanson. I go to Law School
with your daughter Carolyn.

838
00:41:26,304 --> 00:41:30,823
- We met a couple of times, before.
- Oh, of course, Jake!

839
00:41:30,903 --> 00:41:32,383
- It's good to see you again.
- Good to see you too.

840
00:41:32,463 --> 00:41:33,863
You remember... Lily!

841
00:41:36,462 --> 00:41:39,222
This beautiful woman is my wife.

842
00:41:39,302 --> 00:41:41,422
Lily, this is Carolyn's father.

843
00:41:41,462 --> 00:41:44,341
- Oh, nice to meet you.
- Pleasure, I'm sure.

844
00:41:44,381 --> 00:41:47,341
So, what brings you down
from Stanford?

845
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,461
Taking advantage of
the long weekend?

846
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:53,340
- Yeah, we're...
- It's our first anniversary!

847
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,620
Congratulations!
That's great.

848
00:41:56,699 --> 00:41:58,499
Carolyn is down
for the weekend too.

849
00:41:58,579 --> 00:42:00,619
- Really?
- Mm-mm, yeah.

850
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:01,739
Maybe you can
do me a favor then.

851
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:04,098
We split the cost on a couple
of books, last semester,

852
00:42:04,178 --> 00:42:06,538
and I never got an opportunity
to pay her back,

853
00:42:06,578 --> 00:42:09,338
- I'll just write you a check.
- There's nothing for Hanson.

854
00:42:09,418 --> 00:42:11,177
If we had a ticket,
I could check the computer.

855
00:42:11,257 --> 00:42:13,337
But yesterday, my wallet

856
00:42:13,417 --> 00:42:16,697
and my wife's purse were stolen,
and the ticket was in my wallet.

857
00:42:16,777 --> 00:42:19,016
Maybe, you could check again.

858
00:42:19,056 --> 00:42:21,256
Jesus, where did this happen?

859
00:42:21,336 --> 00:42:23,856
We're staying at the Peninsula,

860
00:42:23,936 --> 00:42:26,215
I think it might have been
the housekeeping staff.

861
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:29,695
But Jake has a little more faith
in humanity than I do.

862
00:42:29,775 --> 00:42:32,294
He hates me saying it,
but I think it's true.

863
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:35,454
You have to be so careful
these days.

864
00:42:35,534 --> 00:42:37,893
You sure do.

865
00:42:37,933 --> 00:42:39,773
Honey,
I'm just gonna go

866
00:42:39,853 --> 00:42:42,053
and pick out a wallet.
It was nice to meet you.

867
00:42:42,133 --> 00:42:45,012
- Nice to meet you.
- There you are Mr. Lewis.

868
00:42:45,092 --> 00:42:47,932
- Good.
- I'm sorry, sir, still nothing.

869
00:42:48,012 --> 00:42:50,972
- May I ask what it was?
- It's a shame, it was

870
00:42:51,052 --> 00:42:52,971
a pair of...
a pair of diamond earrings.

871
00:42:53,051 --> 00:42:54,931
Actually,
it's just like those.

872
00:42:55,011 --> 00:42:57,051
- We have those in stock.
- Oh great.

873
00:42:57,131 --> 00:42:59,170
- Let me write you a check
- Only with the proper ID.

874
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,570
Yeah, I understand that but
like I just explained to you,

875
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:04,370
my wallet was...

876
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:07,769
this is sort of a very special day for my
wife and I,

877
00:43:07,849 --> 00:43:10,729
it being our first anniversary.

878
00:43:10,809 --> 00:43:13,208
She thinks we're here to pick up
something for my mother,

879
00:43:13,288 --> 00:43:16,128
but I wanted to surprise her
with something special.

880
00:43:16,168 --> 00:43:18,448
So if you think you can
make an exception today,

881
00:43:20,007 --> 00:43:22,527
- just this one time.
- I'm sorry.

882
00:43:24,327 --> 00:43:26,526
Thank you.

883
00:43:26,606 --> 00:43:29,846
Please, tell Carolyn I said hello
and pass the note for her.

884
00:43:29,926 --> 00:43:32,126
- I sure will.
- It was good to see you again.

885
00:43:32,166 --> 00:43:34,645
Good to see you.

886
00:43:34,725 --> 00:43:37,125
Look, Jake,

887
00:43:37,205 --> 00:43:40,524
why don't you
write me a check,

888
00:43:40,604 --> 00:43:43,244
and let me put the earrings
on my credit card?

889
00:43:44,524 --> 00:43:45,884
Is that all right with you?

890
00:43:45,964 --> 00:43:47,923
If you'd be willing to do that,
that would be great.

891
00:43:48,003 --> 00:43:49,483
Good. Please.

892
00:43:56,962 --> 00:44:00,002
- Mr. Lewis, thanks again.
- You bet, Jake.

893
00:44:01,281 --> 00:44:03,561
Happy Anniversary.

894
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:06,681
All right? Now that's how
you pull a con.

895
00:44:06,721 --> 00:44:10,200
So smile like you just got a present
from the man of your dreams.

896
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,160
Thank you!

897
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,559
You're welcome, now let's give it
a strong finish, all right?

898
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:35,876
He's gone.

899
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,355
- Oh yeah.
- I gotta go get a haircut.

900
00:44:45,595 --> 00:44:47,515
Hey, how you doing?

901
00:44:47,555 --> 00:44:49,434
Hey guys,
good to see you, man.

902
00:44:49,514 --> 00:44:51,394
What's up, boss?

903
00:44:51,474 --> 00:44:53,354
- Right here.
- That's good.

904
00:44:54,874 --> 00:44:56,353
- What are you having?
- I'm gonna go light,

905
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:58,513
I'm gonna get the chicken
and rib combo.

906
00:44:58,553 --> 00:44:59,953
That's light?

907
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:01,912
Yeah,
I'm not getting the coleslaw.

908
00:45:01,992 --> 00:45:04,072
So, what's good here?

909
00:45:05,312 --> 00:45:09,151
- Who the fuck are you?
- Special Agent Gunther Butan.

910
00:45:10,071 --> 00:45:12,591
- Special agent?
- I'm looking for Jake Vig.

911
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:17,070
- Who?
- Who? The invisible man.

912
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:19,470
The specter,
the spook, the ghost.

913
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:21,430
But then the other day,
like a gift,

914
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,749
a buddy of his,
a crew member,

915
00:45:23,829 --> 00:45:25,709
Alphonse Moorely...

916
00:45:25,749 --> 00:45:28,989
you know Alphonse Moorely.
He wakes up with a hole in his head.

917
00:45:29,069 --> 00:45:31,468
Look, Special Agent...
what's your name?

918
00:45:31,548 --> 00:45:33,788
- Butan!
- I got a pretty good sense of humor

919
00:45:33,868 --> 00:45:35,748
- like most people.
- Really, you've a sense of humor?

920
00:45:35,828 --> 00:45:38,067
- Yeah, I do. So if this is
some kind of a fucking joke,

921
00:45:38,147 --> 00:45:39,907
- I'm not into this shit!
- A joke?!

922
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,867
A couple of years ago,
I'm working undercover on a case

923
00:45:41,907 --> 00:45:45,186
that Jake Vig is involved with.
He's running some sort of scam

924
00:45:45,266 --> 00:45:47,466
importing merchandise
for some guy in Tampa.

925
00:45:47,506 --> 00:45:50,025
And I got close,
real close, and he knew it.

926
00:45:50,105 --> 00:45:51,985
In order to let me know,
and to rub it in,

927
00:45:52,065 --> 00:45:54,465
he sent me this tie. Since then,
I've been following him,

928
00:45:54,545 --> 00:45:56,545
from Chicago to Denver
to Salt Lake City,

929
00:45:56,625 --> 00:45:59,224
to Phoenix and I've been
wearing this tie ever since,

930
00:45:59,304 --> 00:46:01,184
because it keeps me motivated.

931
00:46:01,264 --> 00:46:04,023
That's a real nice tie. I don't know if it
says, "Special Agent."

932
00:46:04,103 --> 00:46:06,223
You know what it says?
It says,

933
00:46:06,303 --> 00:46:09,223
"You can't catch me,
so fuck you. So fuck you."

934
00:46:09,303 --> 00:46:12,022
- And fuck you!
- Hey!

935
00:46:14,702 --> 00:46:17,102
Temper's a sign of weakness.
Temper's a sign of weakness.

936
00:46:17,182 --> 00:46:18,941
Hey man, can we get you
a glass of water?

937
00:46:19,021 --> 00:46:21,741
I'm working at this
temper management issue.

938
00:46:23,021 --> 00:46:24,900
My doc says
I should stay calm,

939
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:27,420
because I might do
or say something

940
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,100
- that I might regret later.
- Look, Special Agent...

941
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:33,939
- sell one drug dealer's drugs
to another drug dealer?

942
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:35,899
Hey, hey,
can you put that away?

943
00:46:35,979 --> 00:46:38,938
- Wow!
- Hey, hey, hey...

944
00:46:39,018 --> 00:46:41,378
Butan: Let's take a walk.
Let's go for a walk.

945
00:46:41,458 --> 00:46:43,338
Now here is the deal...

946
00:46:43,418 --> 00:46:46,217
You guys are gonna help me catch
Jake Vig. Whatever he's into next,

947
00:46:46,297 --> 00:46:49,857
you guys are gonna be into.
And whatever you're into, I'm into.
