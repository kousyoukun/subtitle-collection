1
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,360
That's right.

2
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,600
New York.

3
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,960
It's 1958.

4
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,240
Anyway, for a few more minutes it is.

5
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,240
Come midnight, it's going to be 1959.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,200
A whole other feeling.

7
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,720
The New Year.

8
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,720
The future.

9
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,810
Old Daddy Earth fixing to start
one more trip around the sun.

10
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,690
Everybody hoping this ride round
be a little more giddy...

11
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,890
...a little more gay.

12
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,010
All over town, champagne corks
is a-popping.

13
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,530
Over in the Waldorf, the big shots is
dancing to the strains of Guy Lombardo.

14
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,690
In Times Square, the little folks is watching
and waiting for that big ball to drop.

15
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,730
They're all trying to catch hold
of one moment of time...

16
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,770
...to be able to say:

17
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,770
"Right now! This is it!

18
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:44,650
I got it!"

19
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,770
Of course, by then it'll be past.

20
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,970
But they're all happy...

21
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,730
...everybody having a good time.

22
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,290
Well, almost everybody.

23
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,610
There's a few lost souls
floating around out there.

24
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,090
Now, if y'all ain't from the city...

25
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,970
...we got something here
called "the rat race".

26
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,060
Got a way of chewing folks up
so that they don't want no celebrating...

27
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,260
...don't want no cheering up.

28
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,860
Don't care nothing about no New Year's.

29
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,060
Out of hope...

30
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,620
...out of rope...

31
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,020
...out of time.

32
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,580
This here is Norville Barnes.

33
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,300
That office he's stepping out of...

34
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,460
...is the office of the president
of Hudsucker Industries.

35
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,460
That's his office.

36
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,420
How'd he get so high?

37
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,340
And why's he feeling so low?

38
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,780
Is he really going to do it?

39
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,620
Is Norville really going
to jelly up the sidewalk?

40
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,620
Well, the future...

41
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,660
...that's something you can
never tell about.

42
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,980
But the past...

43
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,900
...that's another story.

44
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,970
So in the third quarter
we saw no signs of weakening.

45
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,370
We're up 18%%% over last year's
third-quarter gross...

46
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,970
...and that, needless to say,
is a new record.

47
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,370
Our competition continues to flag
and we continue to take up the slack.

48
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,330
Market shares in most divisions
is increasing...

49
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,330
...and we have opened
seven new regional offices.

50
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,210
Our international division...

51
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:42,330
...is also showing vigorous signs of upward
movement for the last six months...

52
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,570
...and we're looking
at some exciting things in R&D.

53
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,420
Sub-franchising. Don't talk to me
about sub-franchising.

54
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,860
We're making so much money
in sub-franchising...

55
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,500
...it isn't even funny.

56
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,820
Our nominees and assigns continue
to multiply and expand...

57
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,420
...extending our influence nationally
and abroad.

58
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,940
Our owned and operateds are performing...

59
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,100
...far beyond our expectations
both here and abroad.

60
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,700
And the Federal Tax Act of 1958...

61
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,500
...is giving us a swell write-off
on our plant and heavies.

62
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,510
And our last debenture issue
was this year's fastest seller.

63
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,390
So, third quarter and year-to-date...

64
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:26,550
...we have set a new record in sales,
a new record in gross...

65
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,150
...a new record in pre-tax earnings...

66
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,110
...a new record in after-tax profits...

67
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,150
...and our stock has split twice
in the past year.

68
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,550
In short...

69
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,470
...we're loaded.

70
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,560
Mr. Hudsucker?

71
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,180
It's a pity to waste a whole Monte Cristo.

72
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,540
He could've opened the window.

73
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,380
Waring Hudsucker never did anything
the easy way.

74
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,900
Why? Why did he do it?
Everything was going so well.

75
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,500
What am I, a headshrinker?
Maybe the man was unhappy.

76
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,340
He didn't look unhappy.

77
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,300
-He didn't look rich.
-He was never an easy man to figure out.

78
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,340
He built this company with his bare hands.

79
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,100
Every step he took was a step up...

80
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,900
...except, of course, this last one.

81
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,860
He was a swell fella...

82
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,420
...but when the president, chairman
and owner of 87% of the stock...

83
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,580
...drops...

84
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,260
...44 floors...

85
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,060
45.

86
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,420
Counting the mezzanine.

87
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,220
Then the company, too, has a problem.
Stillson!

88
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,860
What exactly is the disposition
of Waring's stock?

89
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,300
As you know...

90
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,540
...Hud left no will and no family.

91
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,580
The company bylaws are quite clear
in that event.

92
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,940
"His entire portfolio will be converted
into common stock...

93
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,270
"...and will be sold over the counter
as of the first of the fiscal year...

94
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,390
-"...following his demise".
-Meaning?

95
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,270
Meaning simply that Waring's stock
and control of the company...

96
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,390
...will be made available
to the public January 1st.

97
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,470
Do you mean to say...

98
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:34,110
...that any slob in a smelly T-shirt
will be able to buy Hudsucker stock?

99
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,430
The company bylaws are quite clear.

100
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,470
My God! You're animals!

101
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,630
How can you discuss his stock
when the man has just leapt 45 floors?

102
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,510
44.

103
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,150
Not counting the mezzanine.

104
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,350
Quit showboating.

105
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,750
The man is gone. The question now
is whether we'll let...

106
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,710
...John Q. Public waltz in here
and buy our company.

107
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,750
What are you suggesting?

108
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,710
Certainly we can't afford
to buy a controlling interest.

109
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,950
Not while the stock is this strong.

110
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,270
How soon before Hud's paper
hits the market?

111
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,150
January 1st.

112
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,550
-Thirty days.
-Four weeks.

113
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,510
-A month at the most.
-One month...

114
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,750
...to make the blue-chip investment
of the century...

115
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,990
...look like a round-trip ticket
on the Titanic.

116
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,670
We play up the fact that Hud is dead.

117
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,150
Long live the Hud!

118
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,270
We depress the stock.

119
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,000
-To the point where we can buy 50%.
-51%.

120
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,360
Not counting the mezzanine.

121
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,360
It could work.

122
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,840
-It should work.
-It would work.

123
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,520
It's working already.

124
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,520
Waring Hudsucker is abstract art
on Madison Avenue.

125
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,880
What we need now is a new president
who will inspire panic in the stockholder.

126
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,400
-A puppet!
-A proxy!

127
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,400
A pawn!

128
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,920
Some jerk...

129
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,320
...we can really push around.

130
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,800
You punch in at 8:30 every a.m.,
at 7:30 a.m. following a business holiday...

131
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,840
...unless it's a Monday, then it's 8:00.

132
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,400
-Punch in late and they dock you.
-This goes to seven! Urgent.

133
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,000
Incoming articles get a voucher.
Outgoing articles provide a voucher.

134
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,400
Move any article without a voucher,
they dock you!

135
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,800
Take this up to the secretarial pool
on three! ASAP!

136
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,440
Letter-size, a green voucher!
Folder-size, a yellow voucher!

137
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,000
Parcel-size, a maroon voucher!

138
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,080
This is for Morgatross! Chop-chop!

139
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,280
Wrong color voucher and they dock you!

140
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,480
6-7-8-7-0-4-9-Alpha-6!

141
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,760
That is your employee number!
It will not be repeated!

142
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,370
Without it, you can't cash your paycheck.

143
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,090
All right! This goes up to 27!

144
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,010
Return a waiver!
Do not return without a signed waiver!

145
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:28,050
Inter-office mail is code 37!
Intra-office mail is 37-3.

146
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,370
Outside mail is 3-37.

147
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,250
Code it wrong and they dock you!

148
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,050
I was supposed to have this on 28
ten minutes ago!

149
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:39,770
This has been your orientation.
Is there anything you do not understand?

150
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,330
If you have not been fully orientated,
you must file a complaint!

151
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,250
File a faulty complaint, and they dock you!

152
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,530
Kloppitt.

153
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,490
Kloppitt, Kloppitt, Kloppitt, Kloppitt....

154
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,930
Max Kloppitt.

155
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,170
"Max Kloppitt, Jr".

156
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,530
What do you do when the envelope
is too big for the slot?

157
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,970
If you fold them, they fire you.

158
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,570
I usually throw them out.

159
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,340
Just got hired today.

160
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,700
Terrific.

161
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,420
Entry level.

162
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,380
But...

163
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,380
...I got big ideas.

164
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,340
I'm sure you do.

165
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,980
For instance...

166
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,300
...look at this sweet baby.

167
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,500
I developed it myself.

168
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,900
Yes, sirree, this is my ticket upstairs.

169
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,780
You know, for kids.

170
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,660
Terrific.

171
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,620
So, you see. I won't be working
in the mail room long.

172
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,540
No, I don't guess you will be.

173
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,260
How long've you been here?

174
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,540
Forty-eight years.

175
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,260
Next year they move me up to parcels...

176
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,580
...if I'm lucky.

177
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,580
Attention Hudsucker employees:

178
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,620
We regretfully announce
that at 30 seconds after the hour of noon...

179
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,940
...Hudsucker time...

180
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,590
...Waring Hudsucker, Founder, President...

181
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,630
...and Chairman of the Board
of Hudsucker Industries...

182
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,150
...merged with the infinite.

183
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,790
To mark this occasion of corporate loss...

184
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:32,830
...we ask that all employees observe
a moment of silent contemplation.

185
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,550
Thank you for your kind attention.

186
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,630
This moment has been duly noted
on your timecards...

187
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,830
...and will be deducted from your pay.
That is all.

188
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,230
Blue letter!

189
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,510
Blue letter!

190
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,270
They're bringing a blue letter!

191
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,400
It's a blue letter.

192
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,360
Top, top level.

193
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,400
Confidential communication
between the brass.

194
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,640
Usually bad news.

195
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,360
They hate blue letters upstairs.

196
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,360
Hate them.

197
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,240
You!

198
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,120
Yeah, you! Barnes!

199
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,880
You don't look busy!

200
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,400
Think you can handle a blue letter?

201
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,920
This letter was sent this morning
by the big man himself, Waring Hudsucker!

202
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,600
It's addressed to Sid Mussburger,
Hudsucker's right-hand man!

203
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,200
It's a blue letter!

204
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,480
That means you got to put it right
in Mussburger's hands.

205
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,840
No secretaries! No receptionists!

206
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,200
No colleagues! No excuses!

207
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,280
Mussburger!

208
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,120
Hi! My name's Buzz, I got the fuzz,
I make the elevator do what she does.

209
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,040
Hang it up to dry.

210
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,960
-What's your pleasure?
-Fourty-four.

211
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,930
Forty-four, the top-brass floor.
Say, buddy...

212
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:27,690
...what takes 50 years to get to
the top floor and 30 seconds to get down?

213
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,090
Waring Hudsucker! You get it, buddy?

214
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:33,610
Say, buddy! Mr. Kline, up to nine.
Mrs. Dell, Personnel.

215
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,610
-Mr. Levin, 37.
-Thirty-six.

216
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:36,730
Walk down!

217
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,490
Ladies and gentlemen,
please step to the rear.

218
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,570
Here comes the gargantuan Mr. Grier.

219
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,010
Buddy, who's the most liquid businessman
on the street?

220
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,370
Waring Hudsucker.

221
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:51,490
When is the sidewalk fully dressed?
When it's wearing Hudsucker!

222
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,610
You get it?

223
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:57,010
It's a pun, a knee-slapper,
a play on Jesus, Joseph and Mary....

224
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,530
Is that a blue letter?

225
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:02,570
Why didn't you tell a guy? Hold on, folks,
we're express to the top floor!

226
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,610
Good luck, buddy.

227
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,050
You'll need it.

228
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,060
Mr. Mussburger's office?

229
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,070
Hello.

230
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,230
Do you have an appointment?

231
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,790
Shall we look in the book?

232
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,670
-We don't seem to be in the book.
-I wouldn't be.

233
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:48,310
If we had an appointment,
we'd be in the book.

234
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,990
I have this....

235
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,750
Oh, here it is.

236
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,230
Gambotz?

237
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,310
Harry Gambotz?

238
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,990
No, too risky.
He's green but he's not slow.

239
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,470
Who is he?

240
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,550
No, I want an imbecile,
not a cipher, or you'd have the job.

241
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,670
They moved him to grommets and O-rings.

242
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,070
He's doing pretty well.

243
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,990
No, not McClanahan.

244
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,870
He bungled the Teleyard merger
so he's got something to prove.

245
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,390
Who let you in?

246
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,000
Atwater? Tremendous.
Except I just fired him last week.

247
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,800
Mr. Mussburger...

248
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,800
...Mr. Bumstead's waiting downstairs.

249
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,040
-I'll be right there.
-Yes, Mr. Mussburger.

250
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,160
Spit it out!

251
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,480
Maybe you're
the company's biggest moron.

252
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,200
We can't use Morris. Been here too long.
He's a nice guy with too many friends.

253
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,160
In fact, why don't you fire him?
Scratch that, I'll fire him.

254
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,160
Make it fast. Fast!

255
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,520
Mr. Bumstead is growing restless.

256
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,960
Tell him I'll be right there.
Give him a magazine.

257
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,480
What are you, a mute?

258
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,400
How's the stock?

259
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,520
Bad? Well, it's not bad enough.

260
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,280
Listen, chump.

261
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,400
Either you find me a ding-dong or tender
your key to the executive washroom.

262
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,200
That goes double for you, pal.
Earclay? Oodgay!

263
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,040
This better be good. I'm in a bad mood.

264
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,440
Sir, I've got something for you
from the mail room, but first...

265
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,320
...if I could take a minute of your very
valuable time to show you something...

266
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,360
...I've been working on
for the past two or three years.

267
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,810
You know, for kids.

268
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:37,490
It's perfect for Hudsucker,
not that I'm any great genius.

269
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,530
They say inspiration is 99% perspiration
and in my case it's at least twice that...

270
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,490
-...but I've got to tell you, sir...
-Wait a minute!

271
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,420
Sit down, son.

272
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,180
Go ahead.

273
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,060
Try it on.

274
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,340
Put your feet up.

275
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,060
Go ahead.

276
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,500
Let's get to know one another, shall we?

277
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,500
Let's chat...

278
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,740
...man-to-man.

279
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,980
You're from the basement, aren't you?

280
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,100
And weren't blessed with much...

281
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,340
...education?

282
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,940
Well, I am a college graduate.

283
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,900
But you did not excel in your studies.

284
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,830
Well, I made the dean's list...

285
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,270
...at the Muncie College
of Business Administration.

286
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:36,270
And your friends called you "jerk",
didn't they?

287
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,750
"Dope?"

288
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:39,750
"Dipstick?"

289
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,230
"Lamebrain?" "Schmo?"

290
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,510
Not even behind your back?

291
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,070
They voted me "Most Likely to Succeed".

292
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,310
You're fired.

293
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,670
Get your feet off my desk,
get out of my office.

294
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,830
Leave your apron in the locker room.

295
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,310
Oh, my God!

296
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:59,630
The Bumstead contracts. I've been
working on that deal for four years!

297
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,790
Get out of here! I'll take care of it!

298
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,710
You could have destroyed
the most sensitive document of my career.

299
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,190
Mr. Bumstead is threatening to leave.

300
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,590
I'm on my way down.

301
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:12,990
We need the first page of the contract
retyped with copies going to Legal.

302
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,590
Yes, Mr. Mussburger.

303
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,790
Out! Out of the office!

304
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,630
Down three points?

305
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:26,030
That's encouraging. How about New York?

306
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,910
Not that way, through the door!

307
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,200
It'll take three hours to retype
the Bumstead contracts.

308
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,320
Where are you going?

309
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,040
Get out! Stop that!

310
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,840
Mr. Bumstead's threatening to leave.

311
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,360
Not the whole contract, just the first page.

312
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,640
I'll be there. Give him another magazine.

313
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,240
-He says he'll leave.
-I said I'll be there!

314
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,760
Up on your feet! We don't crawl here
at Hudsucker Industries!

315
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,920
-My leg is on fire!
-No assumptions!

316
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,520
It's early yet. Just let me know
where we stand at the closing bell.

317
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,720
Oh, my God, the Bumstead contracts!

318
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,840
No magazines! No coffee!

319
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,400
Mussburger! I want to see Mussburger!
Or did he jump out a window too?

320
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,920
Don't worry, Mr. Mussburger, I got you!
I got you by your pants.

321
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,600
Pants?

322
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,770
Mr. Mussburger, I'm gonna give
your pants a nice double stitch.

323
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,810
It'll make them real strong
and you're going to look real sharp.

324
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:41,050
No. Single stitch is fine.

325
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,490
But the double stitch lasts forever.

326
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:47,130
Why on earth would I want
a double stitch?

327
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,770
To pad your account.

328
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,650
Single stitch is fine.

329
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:58,770
Damn!

330
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,330
What the heck! Mr. Mussburger
is such a nice man...

331
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:11,170
...I'm going to give him
a double stitch anyway.

332
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,450
That's some strong stitch, you bet!

333
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,550
"The Einstein of Enterprise".

334
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,990
"The Edison of Industry".

335
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:05,270
"The Billion-Dollar Cranium! "

336
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,550
"Idea Man! "

337
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,590
And not one of you has given me
a story on him!

338
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,310
Bunch of lamebrains!

339
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,310
Facts, figures, charts.
They never sold a newspaper!

340
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,350
I read this morning's Argus
and let me tell you something:

341
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,950
I'd wrap a fish in it!

342
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,590
I'd use it as kindling!

343
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:26,870
I'd train my poodle on it if he wasn't
a French poodle and partial to Paris Soir.

344
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,790
But I wouldn't pay a nickel
to read the thing!

345
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,830
Come on, Chief, give us a break.

346
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,440
Sure, Tibbs. Take a break.

347
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,200
Go to Florida. Lie in the sun.

348
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,160
Wait for a coconut to drop.
File a story on it.

349
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,640
It'd be more of a grabber than your piece
on the county grain surplus!

350
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,120
The human angle!
That's what sells papers!

351
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,800
We need a front page with a heart
and the ldea Man can put it there!

352
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,280
If we had more access...

353
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,720
If a frog had wings
it wouldn't bump it's ass hopping.

354
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,760
I don't want excuses, I want results!

355
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,720
What makes the ldea Man tick?
Where's he from?

356
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,280
I want to know everything about him!
Has he got a girl? Has he got parents?

357
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,320
Everybody has parents.

358
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,080
All right, how many?

359
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,320
How about it, Parkinson?
You've been awfully quiet.

360
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,600
Still waters run deep.

361
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,080
Only thing deep with Parkinson
are the holes in his ears.

362
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,720
Yes! ldea Man!

363
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,440
What are his hopes and dreams,
his desires and aspirations?

364
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,320
Does he think all the time
or a certain portion of the day?

365
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,800
How tall is he? Where does he sleep?
What does he have for breakfast?

366
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,000
Does he put jam on his toast
or doesn't he?

367
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,040
If not, why not and since when?

368
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,960
Well?

369
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,730
You're useless.

370
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,650
Yes. Idea Man.

371
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,250
"Creator".

372
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:40,330
"Innovator".

373
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:41,890
"Cerebrator".

374
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,530
Fake!

375
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,090
I tell you, the guy's a phony.

376
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,610
-Phony?
-As a $3 bill.

377
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:49,290
-Says who?
-Says me, Amy Archer!

378
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,610
Why is he an ldea Man?
Because Hudsucker says so?

379
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:54,170
What are his ideas?
Why can't anyone interview him?

380
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,250
Five bucks says she mentions her Pulitzer.

381
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:58,970
Again? You're on.

382
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,930
Look at the mug on this guy.

383
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:04,010
The jutting eyebrows, the simian forehead,
the idiotic grin.

384
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,890
He has a face only a mother could love...

385
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,210
...on payday.

386
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:11,290
The only story here is
how this guy made a monkey out of you.

387
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:13,850
Like it or not, I'm still editor of this rag.

388
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:17,010
I thought you were writing,
"J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?"

389
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:20,170
-I filed it yesterday. Nice tie, Earl.
-Well, do a follow-up.

390
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,250
"Hoover: Crimebuster or Pantywaist?"

391
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:25,410
The rest of you mugs get some brains
and get me that ldea Man story!

392
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,170
He's the bunk.

393
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:35,820
I'll stake my Pulitzer on it!

394
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,220
Say, buddy, where'd you get the new duds?

395
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,100
Say, buddy, how did Old Bucketbutt
like his blue letter?

396
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,700
Did he bust a gut? Did he die?
Well, hello, Mr. Mussburger.

397
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,140
Lobby, we haven't got all day.

398
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,900
Right away, Mr. Mussburger.

399
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,980
How're you this fine morning, sir?

400
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,020
It's been a pleasure serving you today, sir.

401
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,620
It's been a pleasure serving you too, buddy.

402
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:01,340
Shouldn't we be a little concerned
with the downward spiral of our stock...

403
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,700
...these past few days?

404
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,340
You're the expert,
but at the Muncie College of Business...

405
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,060
Relax, it's only natural...

406
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,620
...in a period of transition for
the more timid element to run for cover.

407
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,220
Like I said, you're the expert
but do you remember the plan I outlined...

408
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,340
...the day I set fire to your....
The day I was promoted?

409
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:21,740
I do remember and I was impressed.
But that's all forgotten now.

410
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,940
Thank you, Sid.

411
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:29,180
The reason I mention it is it requires
such a small capital investment....

412
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:32,380
-There's a huge potential profit...
-Damn it, where's my car?

413
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,340
...given the demographics boom
of the burgeoning middle-class.

414
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:39,310
So if you agree, I'd like to bounce the idea
off a few people at lunch.

415
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,350
Sure.

416
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:44,310
Tell whoever you want.
I'd like to hear about it at some point too.

417
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,550
I got gas, Benny.

418
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,390
Tell me about it.

419
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,990
No kidding, Benny. I got gas.

420
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,190
You get the special?

421
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,630
Far from it.

422
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,670
Enter the dame.

423
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,310
There's one in every story.

424
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:14,390
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.

425
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:17,470
Twenty bucks says not here,
she don't find one.

426
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,630
She's looking for her mark.

427
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,870
She finds him.

428
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,470
She sits down and orders...

429
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,070
...a light lunch.

430
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,670
How will she pay for this lunch?

431
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,830
She looks through her purse.

432
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,110
No money.

433
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,190
The mark notices.

434
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,200
He's not noticing, Benny.

435
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,640
Maybe he's wise.

436
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,440
He don't look wise.

437
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,720
Plan two.

438
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,760
Here come the waterworks.

439
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,080
-Yellowstone.
-Old Faithful.

440
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,920
Hello, Niagara.

441
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,480
He notices.

442
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,880
She's distressed.

443
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,480
He's concerned.

444
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,040
She explains her predicament.

445
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,360
And....

446
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,920
Enter the light lunch.

447
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,080
She's got other problems, of course.

448
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,960
There's illness in the family.

449
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,160
-Her mother needs an operation.
-Urgently.

450
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,920
-Adenoids.
-No, Benny.

451
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,600
Lumbago.

452
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,560
That gag's got whiskers on it.

453
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,200
He ain't biting, Benny.

454
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,000
-She's losing him, Lou.
-Maybe he's wise.

455
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,240
He don't look wise.

456
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,440
-How does she pull this out?
-He's getting away.

457
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,000
She better think fast.

458
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,600
She isn't.

459
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,320
She is!

460
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,680
She's good, Benny.

461
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,720
She's damn good, Lou.

462
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,050
Can I get you boys anything else?

463
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,370
Bromo.

464
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,250
Bromo.

465
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:50,770
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs.
It was just that horrible elevator boy!

466
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:53,810
I can't say how much I appreciate
your listening to my story.

467
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:58,130
I'm lucky to find someone in this bustling
city with a stout heart and a ready ear.

468
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,890
There I was, travelling
through this great country.

469
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:03,210
Some I met were kind to me,
others exceedingly cruel.

470
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,610
Traveling by motor bus, rail,
even by thumb....

471
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,010
The couch, please.

472
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:10,410
Hoarding every dollar, counting
every nickel, pinching every penny.

473
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:13,250
It's been a long road leading
to the coffee shop downstairs.

474
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:16,530
Not that I'd trade a day, an hour,
a moment of it for anything.

475
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,370
I don't know what came over me.

476
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:20,650
I guess it was the shock of eating
after so long...

477
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:23,010
...without the enzymes kicking in
after so long....

478
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:30,450
Then you couldn't possibly know
what it is to be tired and hungry.

479
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:31,650
Hungry, anyway.

480
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:34,690
I don't want to bore you with details
of my life. It's not happy.

481
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:37,130
Suffice to say I'm jobless,
but not for want of trying.

482
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:40,660
I'm friendless, with no one to take care
of me and had you not come along...

483
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:43,340
-...exactly when you did....
-I, myself...

484
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,340
I arrived in town not ten days ago...

485
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,500
...full of dreams, anxious to make my way
in the world...

486
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,220
...a little naive perhaps,
but armed with determination...

487
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,820
...a solid work ethic,
and an indomitable belief in the future...

488
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,700
-I, myself...
-...only to have that belief...

489
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,980
...that unsullied optimism, dashed against
the marble of the workplace.

490
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,980
Such is life. Seek and ye shall find.
Work and ye shall prosper.

491
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,660
-Cigarette?
-No, thank you.

492
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,980
Seek and ye shall find,
work and ye shall prosper.

493
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,700
These were the watchwords,
the ethos of my education...

494
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,220
...the values instilled in me...

495
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,460
...while I was growing up in a town
you've probably never heard of.

496
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,140
-Mind if I join you?
-Be my guest.

497
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,180
A town you've probably never heard of...

498
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:20,020
...a dusty crossroads of which
you've probably never heard.

499
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,020
Excuse me. Executive washroom.

500
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,260
Are you all right?

501
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,020
Is it your lunch? The chicken à la king?

502
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,220
Is the à la king repeating on you?

503
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,190
No, I'm fine. You were saying?

504
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,790
Values, watchwords, tender years.

505
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,790
A little town you've probably
never heard of:

506
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,870
Muncie, Indiana.

507
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,030
You're from Muncie?

508
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,110
Why, yes.

509
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,190
Do you know it?

510
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:18,150
"Fight on
Fight on, dear old Muncie

511
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:22,630
"Fight on
Hoist the gold and blue

512
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:26,550
"You'll be tattered, torn and hurting

513
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:30,550
"Once the Munce is done with...

514
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,710
"...you.

515
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,790
"Go...

516
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,350
"Go...

517
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,080
"...Eagles!

518
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,200
"...Eagles! "

519
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,600
A Muncie girl!
What do you know about that?

520
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,920
I'm going to cancel the rest
of my appointments for today...

521
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,880
...and get you a job right here at Hud.

522
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,440
Oh, no! Really...

523
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,040
Don't bother to thank me. It's easy.
I know where a vacancy just came up.

524
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,200
Mailroom.

525
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,480
Good afternoon, this is Norville Barnes.

526
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,880
Barnes! Where the hell have you been?
Where's my voucher?

527
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,360
I'm not sure.

528
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,240
I need that voucher!
I told you a week ago it was important!

529
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,160
I'm president of the company now.

530
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,560
I don't care if you're president
of the company!

531
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,720
I need the voucher now!

532
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Why don't you work in here with me?

533
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,520
Are you familiar with
the mimeograph machine?

534
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,840
Well, of course. I went
to the Muncie Secretarial Polytechnic.

535
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,000
A Muncie girl! Can you beat that?

536
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,560
I just don't know how to thank you,
Mr. Barnes.

537
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,640
Please, Norville.

538
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,210
Go, Eagles!

539
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:43,890
Go, Eagles!

540
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,770
"Once the Munce...".

541
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:50,450
Holy moly!

542
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:53,650
Is this guy from Chumpsville?
I even pulled the old mother routine.

543
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,410
Adenoids?

544
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,370
Lumbago.

545
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:57,450
That gag's got whiskers on it.

546
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,890
I'm telling you, the Hudsucker Board's
up to something.

547
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:02,770
What's a six-letter word
for an affliction of the hypothalamus?

548
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:05,850
It's a cinch. Goiter.
It's a cinch this guy isn't in on it.

549
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:06,890
She's right here.

550
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,130
How much time to make the late final?

551
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:12,250
Hi, Chief, just the person
I wanted to apologize to.

552
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,530
About seven minutes.

553
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,770
I was all wet about your ldea Man.

554
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:20,650
Well, thanks for being so generous.
It is human and you are divine.

555
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,930
No, he's no faker.

556
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:26,650
He's a 100% real McCoy,
beware of imitations, genuine article.

557
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:30,170
The guy's a real moron,
as in a five-letter word for imbecile.

558
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:33,130
As pure a specimen as I've ever run across.

559
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,730
If I'm not an expert...

560
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:39,170
...then my name isn't Amy Archer
and I never won the Pulitzer.

561
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:40,570
In 1957.

562
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,380
My series on the reunited triplets.

563
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,460
Come down here, hammerhead,
and I'll show it to you!

564
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,420
What's a three-letter word
for a flightless bird?

565
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,740
Not now, I'm busy.

566
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:55,780
I said, "hammerhead" as in a ten-letter
word for a smug, bullying newspaper man.

567
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,660
Gnu. That's G-N-U.

568
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:01,140
Couldn't find the Empire State Building
with a compass, map and a guide.

569
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:01,980
Or emu?

570
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:05,620
That's just potatoes. Here's the gravy.
The chump really liked me.

571
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,500
-A Muncie girl!
-Better off falling for a rattlesnake.

572
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,140
This guy's just a patsy
and I'm gonna find out what for.

573
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:15,460
There's a real story here, some kind
of plot, set-up.... Did I tell you?

574
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,380
-He didn't offer you money?
-A sawbuck!

575
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,380
Ten smackers! Let's grab a highball!

576
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,860
On Norville Barnes.

577
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:22,780
Copy!

578
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,430
Miss Smith, would you come in
and take a letter?

579
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,310
Of all the cockamamie....

580
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:01,230
Did you see the front page
of today's Manhattan Argus?

581
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:05,310
I didn't bother to read the article.
I didn't think the picture did you justice.

582
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,390
The picture's fine.

583
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,870
It's what that knuckle-headed dame
wrote underneath.

584
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,390
Take this down.

585
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,990
Dear Miss Archer:

586
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:18,190
I call you "Miss" because you seem to have
missed the boat completely.

587
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:20,190
How would you know if I'm an imbecile...

588
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:23,110
...when you didn't have the guts
to interview me man-to-man!

589
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,670
Change "man-to-man" to "face-to-face".

590
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:28,070
No, change "face-to-face" to "eye-to-eye"
and "guts" to "common decency".

591
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:30,190
These wild speculations
about my intelligence...

592
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:32,510
...these preposterous inventions
would be better suited...

593
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:35,310
...for the pages of Amazing Tales Magazine.

594
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,950
If the editors of the Manhattan Argus
see fit...

595
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:42,230
...to publish the work of a disordered mind,
perhaps they will see fit to publish this.

596
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:43,390
But I doubt it.

597
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:47,320
I most seriously doubt it. I doubt also
you could find a home at Amazing Tales...

598
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,760
...a periodical which I have enjoyed
for many years. Sincerely...

599
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,200
...et cetera.

600
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,880
Is that all, Mr. Barnes?

601
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,520
You know me, Amy, better than this dame.
Do you think I'm an imbecile?

602
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,160
Well, I'm sure I....

603
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,720
Tell the truth. I trust you.
I place a lot of stock in your opinion.

604
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,280
Oh, sure, you're biased.

605
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,160
You're a fellow Muncian.

606
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,680
But let me ask you a question:

607
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,160
Would an imbecile come up with this?

608
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,720
I designed it myself.

609
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,920
This sweet baby will put Hudsucker
right back on top.

610
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,760
You know, for kids.

611
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,160
Why don't I just type this up?

612
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,130
That won't be necessary.
I shouldn't send it.

613
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:48,210
She's just doing her job, I guess.

614
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:50,770
I don't know, maybe she does deserve it.

615
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:54,290
Maybe she should have come in here
and faced you man-to-man.

616
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:58,050
-She probably had a deadline.
-She still could've gotten your side...

617
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,610
...for the record.

618
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:02,290
It's done now. What's the use
of grousing about it?

619
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:05,330
Forget the letter,
I just had to blow off steam.

620
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:07,770
She's probably just a little confused.

621
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:10,010
"Confused?"

622
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:13,290
Probably a fast-talking career gal,
thinks she's one of the boys.

623
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:15,170
Probably is, if you know what I mean.

624
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,730
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.

625
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:20,570
Probably suffers from one
of these complexes they have nowadays.

626
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:24,290
It's obvious. She's probably
very unattractive and bitter about it.

627
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:25,570
Is that it?

628
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:30,090
She probably dresses in men's clothing,
drinks with the guys at the local bar...

629
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:34,050
...hobnobs with some smooth-talking heel
reporter named Biff or Smoocher or...

630
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:34,850
Smitty.

631
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:37,330
Exactly. I bet she's ugly, real ugly.

632
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:39,770
Otherwise, why isn't her picture
next to her byline?

633
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:43,250
Maybe she puts her work
ahead of her personal appearance.

634
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:45,210
I bet that's what she tells herself.

635
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:48,420
But you and I know
she's a dried-up, bitter old maid.

636
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,620
How about we grab a little dinner
and a show after work?

637
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,540
I was thinking maybe The King and I?

638
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,900
How about Oklahoma?

639
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,540
You don't know a thing about that woman!

640
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:02,380
You don't know who she really is!
Only a numbskull thinks he knows things...

641
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,580
...about things he knows nothing about.

642
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,060
Say, what gives?

643
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,520
The inventory of the Jacksonville facility
should be reduced...

644
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,640
...by 15%. Memo from the desk
of Sidney J. Mussburger...

645
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,040
What are you doing, Miss Archer?

646
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,920
Who are you?
How did you know who I am?

647
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,600
I suspect Old Moses knows
just about everything...

648
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,480
...leastways if it concerns Hudsucker.

649
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,920
Who are you? What do you do here?

650
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,080
I keep the old circle turning.

651
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,600
This old clock needs plenty of care.

652
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,080
Time is money, Miss Archer.

653
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:52,410
Money drives that old global economy...

654
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:54,770
...and keeps Big Daddy Earth
spinning around.

655
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:57,450
See, without that capital formation...

656
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:01,450
You won't tell anyone about me, will you?

657
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:03,970
I don't tell no one nothing...

658
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:06,050
...unless they ask.

659
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:08,330
That just ain't Old Moses' way.

660
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:10,770
If you know everything about Hudsucker...

661
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:14,250
...tell me why the board decided
to make Norville Barnes president?

662
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:17,170
That even surprised Old Moses at first.

663
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:19,810
I didn't think the board was that smart.

664
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:20,770
"That smart?"

665
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:23,690
But then I figured it out.
They did it because...

666
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:27,450
...they figured young Norville for
an imbecile, like some other people I know.

667
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:30,970
Why on earth would the board
want a nitwit to be president?

668
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:35,090
Because they're little piglets.
They're trying to inspire panic...

669
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:39,010
...make that stock cheap so they can
snatch it all up for themselves.

670
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:42,530
But Norville's got some tricks
up his sleeve. He does.

671
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,570
"You know, for kids?"

672
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:49,050
Yeah, he's a smart one, that Norville.

673
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:54,540
But I guess you don't really know him
any better than that board does, do you?

674
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:56,140
Maybe l...

675
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:00,580
And only some kind of knuckle-head thinks
she knows things about things....

676
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,300
When she don't....

677
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,700
How'd that go?

678
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,660
Well, it's hardly the same.

679
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:10,060
You don't even know your own self.

680
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,860
You ain't exactly the genuine article,
are you, Miss Archer?

681
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:18,980
In connection with my job, sometimes
I have to go undercover, as it were.

682
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,500
I don't mean that.

683
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:24,500
Why are you pretending to be
such a hard old sourpuss?

684
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,140
Ain't going to never make you happy!

685
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:30,620
I'm happy enough.

686
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:38,140
I got gears to see to.

687
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:44,260
I'm plenty happy!

688
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:55,750
I can't print that!

689
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:59,470
Why not? It's true. The board's using him
to depress the stock and buy it cheap.

690
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:02,350
It's pure speculation!
They'd have my butt in a satchel!

691
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:04,750
They'll buy that stock...

692
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:08,270
You don't know anything. They haven't
bought it. What are they waiting for?

693
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:08,990
I don't know.

694
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:11,350
Amy's hunches are usually pretty good.

695
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:14,070
You don't accuse somebody
of stock manipulation on a hunch!

696
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:16,910
Our readers aren't interested
in sensationalism, gossip...

697
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:18,270
...unsupported speculation!

698
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:21,230
Facts! Figures! Those are the tools
of the newspaper trade.

699
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:24,870
It's as if you're trying to take the heat
off him. Like you've gone soft on him.

700
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:26,990
Come on, Chief. That's a low blow.

701
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,750
Archer's not going to go gooey
for a corn-fed idiot.

702
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:33,110
I was out of line. But you're out of line
with this stock-swindle story.

703
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:35,630
Give me more of that
"moron from Sheboygan" stuff.

704
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:36,830
-Muncie.
-Whatever.

705
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:38,510
That's what sells newspapers!

706
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:41,150
I've got a harder story:
"The Sap From The City Desk! "

707
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:43,630
-Watch it!
-It's about a dim-witted editor who...

708
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:44,990
Easy, tough guy.

709
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:50,230
Does this suit look mannish to you?

710
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:52,390
Yeah, sure. Let's grab a highball.

711
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,360
Back off!

712
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,880
Smoocher!

713
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,760
What gives?

714
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,840
A man of great managerial potency.

715
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,640
My husband is also a president.

716
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,000
Sears Braithwaite of Bullard.
Do you know him?

717
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,320
Your companion is an ode!

718
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,000
A lyric! Are you betrothed?

719
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,520
Amy works in my office. She runs...

720
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,680
Oh, the folly of youth!

721
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,760
Those green remembered hills!

722
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,960
That bourn from which no traveler returns.

723
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,680
I once ran the mimeograph for Sidney.

724
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,800
Though engaged at the time
to quelqu'un d'autre...

725
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,400
...my water-cooler romance
became a mad passion.

726
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,600
Un amour fou. Une folie à deux.

727
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:56,370
I'm brushing up on my French
with the most charming man...

728
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:59,970
-...Pierre of 5th Avenue. Do you know him?
-Do you know him?

729
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:04,490
Sidney and I are planning a trip
to Paris and points continental.

730
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:08,810
Aren't we, dear?

731
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:13,290
Sure. I'd like to borrow Norville
for a while, if you don't mind.

732
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:16,410
Well, frankly, I....

733
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:19,370
You have a very charming wife, Mr.... Sid.

734
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:20,810
So they tell me.

735
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:24,490
Let me shepherd you
through some of the introductions here.

736
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:26,570
Try not to talk too much.

737
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:29,130
Some of our biggest stockholders are....

738
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:31,410
Scratch that. Say whatever you like.

739
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:34,170
Shake hands with
Sears Braithwaite of Bullard.

740
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,050
Glad to know you, Barnes.

741
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:38,130
This is Zebulon Cardozo...

742
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:41,210
...one of Hudsucker's largest
and most loyal stockholders.

743
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,610
What's this I hear
about you being an imbecile?

744
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:45,250
What's ailing you, boy?

745
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:49,370
Last week, my stock was worth twice
what it is now. I think I'll sell...

746
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:53,330
...the whole kit and caboodle, boy,
unless I see a vast improvement.

747
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:56,180
What you've got here, son, is a range war!

748
00:50:56,340 --> 00:51:00,060
You gonna have to circle our wagons
or I'm gonna get out of your wagon train.

749
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,660
No need for concern, sir.
It's only natural...

750
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:06,860
...in a period of transition for the more
timid elements to run for cover.

751
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,820
Yellow? I'll show you yellow, boy!

752
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:13,420
You mind now and quit acting
like such an old grizzly.

753
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,420
Step lively here, Norville.

754
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:19,020
I'm sorry, I thought maybe if I showed him
the long view...

755
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:21,940
And this is Thorstensen Finlandson...

756
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:24,820
...who heads a radical, splinter group
of disgruntled investors.

757
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,260
Pleased to meet you.

758
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:29,740
It might interest you to know I studied
a little Finnish in high school.

759
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:31,380
I hope I'm not too rusty.

760
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:42,220
Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished
members of the Hudsucker Board...

761
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:46,340
...I give you the Rajah of Romance,
the Ministereo of Moonlight...

762
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:48,980
...the incredible, the unforgettable...

763
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:51,860
...Mr. Vic Tenetta!

764
00:51:58,350 --> 00:51:59,990
"Rajah". I like that.

765
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:42,670
What happened?

766
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:48,350
Nothing. Just the more timid investors
are no longer running for cover.

767
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:49,590
Let me look.

768
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:51,510
Sid found me the ice pack.

769
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:54,150
Let me hold it or you'll have a real shiner.

770
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:58,160
I guess people are pretty hot
over this imbecile story.

771
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,040
I'm sorry.

772
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,520
It's not your fault. You've the one person
standing by me through all this.

773
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,280
Norville, there's something
I have to tell you.

774
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,240
You see...

775
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,760
...I'm not really a secretary.

776
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:13,800
I know that, Amy.

777
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:14,840
You do?

778
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:18,040
I understand you're not very skilled yet
in the secretarial arts...

779
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:21,120
...but I'll tell you a secret:
I'm not that skilled as president.

780
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:24,480
-I know I put up a big front, but...
-I believe in you, Norville.

781
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,120
At least...

782
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,960
...I believe in your intentions.

783
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,520
I don't blame them, really.
I suppose I have made a mess of things.

784
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,320
Those folks have to protect
their investment.

785
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,920
Most of them are very nice people.

786
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:41,280
Listen, you can't trust people here
like you did in Muncie.

787
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,320
Certain people are...

788
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:47,200
Did you ever go to the top of Larson's
feed tower and look out over the town?

789
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,440
On Farm Route 17?

790
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,160
Oh, yes, in Muncie.

791
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,880
No, Vidalia. Farm Route 17.

792
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:00,810
Seventeen. Yes, I....
Well, no, no. I never really...

793
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:06,130
The guys from the Varsity Squad
would bring their dates up there...

794
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:08,450
...to hold hands.

795
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:11,410
Of course, I never made Varsity.

796
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:15,730
There's a place I go now.

797
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:19,450
Cutest little place near my apartment
in Greenwich Village.

798
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:21,410
It's called "Ann's 440".

799
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:23,090
It's a beatnik bar.

800
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:24,530
-You don't say?
-Yes.

801
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:25,570
A beatnik bar.

802
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:29,010
You can get carrot juice or ltalian coffee
and the people there...

803
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:31,250
Well, none of them quite fit in.

804
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:33,010
You'd love it.

805
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:34,890
Come there with me.

806
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:38,130
There's a marathon poetry-reading
on New Year's Eve. I go every year.

807
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:40,370
-It's marvelous!
-Every year?

808
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:46,690
Well, this year, if it's good,
I plan to make it a tradition.

809
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:50,730
My, it certainly is beautiful.

810
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:52,970
The people...

811
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:54,890
...look like ants.

812
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:59,060
The Hindus, and the beatniks also,
say that...

813
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:02,260
...in our next lives some of us
will come back as ants.

814
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:06,700
Some will be butterflies, others will be
elephants or creatures of the sea.

815
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,260
What a beautiful thought.

816
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:11,020
What do you think you were
in a previous life?

817
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,620
Oh, I don't know.

818
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:15,820
Maybe I was just...

819
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:20,180
...a fast-talking career gal
who thought she was one of the boys.

820
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,420
Oh, no, Amy.

821
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:24,420
Pardon me for saying so,
but I find that very far-fetched.

822
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:28,380
-There really is something I must tell you.
-That person would come back as a hog.

823
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:31,060
I find it more likely that you were...

824
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:33,380
...a gazelle...

825
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:37,780
...with long, graceful legs,
gamboling through the underbrush.

826
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,180
Perhaps we met once.

827
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,460
A chance encounter in a forest glade.

828
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:47,780
I must have been an antelope or an ibex.

829
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:52,340
The times we must've had
foraging together for sustenance...

830
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:55,740
...snorfling water
from a mountain stream...

831
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:59,750
...picking the grubs and burrs
from one another's coats.

832
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:06,750
Or perhaps we simply touched horns
briefly and went our separate ways.

833
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:10,550
Oh, I wish it were that simple, Norville.

834
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:15,950
I wish I was still a gazelle
and you were an antelope...

835
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,070
...or an ibex.

836
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:24,030
Can I at least call you...

837
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:25,350
...deer?

838
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:29,470
You're funny.

839
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:32,670
Seriously, Amy, it's what
your beatnik friends call "karma".

840
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:33,670
Karma.

841
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:36,590
The great circle of life, death and rebirth.

842
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:40,310
I think I heard of that.
What goes around comes around.

843
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:43,790
That's it. A great wheel
that gives us all what we deserve.

844
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:48,190
I've go to show Sid and all the guys
I deserve their confidence.

845
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:50,630
Tomorrow's my big presentation
to the board.

846
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:54,230
Kiss me, Amy!

847
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:56,070
Kiss me once for luck.

848
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:58,630
Sure, Norville.

849
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,720
You know, for kids!

850
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,720
It has economy, simplicity, low
production cost, potential for mass appeal.

851
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,000
All that spells out great profitability.

852
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,680
I had the boys at R&D
make this prototype...

853
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,640
...so our discussion
could have some focus...

854
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:54,440
...and to give you gentleman a firsthand
look at how exciting this gizmo is.

855
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,760
It's fun, healthy, good exercise,
and the kids'll love it.

856
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,840
We put a little sand inside
to make the experience more pleasant.

857
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,090
The great part is we don't have
to charge an arm and a leg.

858
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:09,370
-What if you tire before it's done?
-Does it have rules?

859
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:11,530
-Can more than one play?
-Why is it a game?

860
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:13,130
-Is it a game?
-Will it break?

861
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:15,290
-It better break eventually.
-Is there an object?

862
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:17,930
-What if you tire before it's done?
-Does it have batteries?

863
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:20,730
-Could we charge extra for them?
-Is it safe for toddlers?

864
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:23,130
-How do you know you're finished?
-How does it stop?

865
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:25,690
-Is that a boy's model?
-Can a parent assemble it?

866
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:29,850
-What if you tire before it's done?
-Is there a larger model for the obese?

867
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:32,050
What the hell is it?

868
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:33,370
Well, it's....

869
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:38,090
Brilliant!

870
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:40,970
Genius.

871
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:45,370
It's exactly what Hudsucker Industry needs
at this juncture.

872
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:50,530
Even a blind man can tell you
there'll be an enormous demand for this...

873
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:52,970
...this....

874
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:54,850
Congratulations.

875
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:57,330
You've outdone yourself.
You've reinvented the wheel.

876
00:58:57,410 --> 00:59:00,250
I'll recommend to the board
that we proceed immediately...

877
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:03,220
...and that the...

878
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,500
...dingus be mass-produced
with all deliberate speed.

879
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:09,580
Although, you realize...

880
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,260
...of course...

881
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:15,620
...as president...

882
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:17,860
...the ultimate decision is yours.

883
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:20,220
I'm for it.

884
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:08,270
The Flying Doughnut!

885
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:10,590
-The Dancing Dingus!
-The Belly-Go-Round.

886
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:11,870
The Swingerina!

887
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:13,350
The Wacky Circumference!

888
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:15,150
Uncle Midriff!

889
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:46,430
-We need something short!
-Sharp!

890
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:47,190
Snappy!

891
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:49,630
-With a little jazz!
-The Shazzammeter!

892
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:51,830
-The Hipster!
-The Daddy-O!

893
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,040
-The Hoopsucker.
-The Hudswinger.

894
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,280
-The Hoopsucker!
-The Hudswinger!

895
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,000
-The Hoopsucker!
-The Hudswinger!

896
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,010
-Fellas!
-You got something?

897
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:09,370
I got something!

898
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:17,640
Rockwell News presents: Tidbits of Time.

899
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,600
World news in pictures, we kid you not!

900
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,080
As Old Man 1958 hobbles
towards his finish...

901
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,960
...Barnes is the name
on every American lip.

902
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:30,520
Norville Barnes, young president
of Hudsucker Industries...

903
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:34,080
...a boy bred in the heartland,
but now the toast of New York.

904
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:38,880
Barnes is the brainy inventor of America's
craziest craze: The Hula Hoop!

905
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:42,960
Reaping huge profits for his company
and winning the hearts...

906
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,680
...and hips of every youngster in America!

907
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,480
Did I say youngster?

908
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,600
Here's Mom taking a break
from her household chores...

909
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,680
...and even Dad is swinging into the act!

910
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:00,840
Cards, letters, congratulations come
pouring in from Kankakee to Petaluma...

911
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,280
...including one very special
long-distance call.

912
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:06,400
He's on! He's on the line!

913
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:15,010
Hello, Norville. This is the President.

914
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:18,810
I just wanted to congratulate you.
I'm very proud of you.

915
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:21,690
Mrs. Eisenhower is very proud of you.

916
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:24,490
The American people are very proud of you.

917
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:34,170
How'd you come up with the idea
for the Hula Hoop?

918
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:36,370
It was no great idea, really.

919
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:40,090
A thing like this takes a whole company
to put together. I'm grateful.

920
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:43,170
Did you have any idea
there'd be such a huge response?

921
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:46,210
Frankly, I don't think anybody
expected this much hoopla.

922
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:51,330
"Hoopla on the Hula Hoop".
Can we quote you on that, Mr. Barnes?

923
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:52,810
Sure, I guess.

924
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:55,770
Will you give yourself a nice, fat raise?

925
01:06:56,970 --> 01:06:58,130
Come on, you guys.

926
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:10,020
What scientific principle explains
the motion of this wheel of wonder?

927
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,140
The dingus is quite simple, really.

928
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:16,420
It operates on the same principles that
keep the earth spinning around the sun...

929
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:20,780
...and that keeps you from flying off
the earth into the cold reaches of space...

930
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:23,340
...where you would die
like a miserable Schwein.

931
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:25,420
Yes, the principle is the same...

932
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:29,900
...except for the piece of grit
they put in to make the experience...

933
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:31,740
...more pleasant.

934
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:34,420
Yes, it's hula-hula everywhere!

935
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:37,140
From the parties of the Park Avenue
smart set...

936
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:43,700
...to sweethearts who want
to be married in the swing of things.

937
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:51,140
Did the board consider you an "Idea Man"
when they promoted you?

938
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:54,620
I guess. I don't think they promoted me
because they thought I was a schmo.

939
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:57,860
What's the next big idea for you
and Hudsucker Industries?

940
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:01,180
I don't know. An idea like this sweet baby
doesn't just come overnight.

941
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:05,340
Although, I'll tell you one thing:
I certainly didn't expect all this hoopla.

942
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:07,620
You can quote me on that.

943
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:18,030
Rumpus Magazine has called you
the most eligible bachelor of the year.

944
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:21,110
And society pages have been linking you
with fashion model Za-Za.

945
01:08:21,150 --> 01:08:25,030
There's no truth to the rumors.
We're just dear friends. Isn't that right?

946
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:35,990
How do you respond to the charges that
you're out of ideas? Have you run dry?

947
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:39,950
Not at all. Just this week I came up
with several new sweet ideas.

948
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:44,550
A larger model Hula Hoop for the portly,
a battery option for the lazy or spastic.

949
01:08:44,670 --> 01:08:46,950
A model with extra sand
for the hard-of-hearing.

950
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:48,630
I'm earning my keep.

951
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:51,230
Speaking of that,
do you expect to get a raise?

952
01:08:51,550 --> 01:08:55,430
By anyone's account I single-handedly
have saved Hudsucker Industries.

953
01:08:55,550 --> 01:08:59,950
Our stock is worth more now than ever.
Yes, I expect to be compensated for that.

954
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:20,760
Pull yourself together, man.

955
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,240
Nobody told me!

956
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,320
You sold all our stock?

957
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,280
We dumped the whole load.

958
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:29,640
I had 20,000 shares!

959
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:31,960
I'd be a millionaire now!

960
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,040
Sure. We'd all be millionaires.

961
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:36,720
There's no point in looking back.

962
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:41,200
At the time, Stillson thought that dumping
our position would panic the market...

963
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:43,200
...further depress the stock.

964
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,840
Then we could buy it back and more,
of course, once it got cheap.

965
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:47,840
Cheap?

966
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,080
It's never been more valuable!

967
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,120
And I'm ruined.

968
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:54,800
Ruined!

969
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:04,880
I'm getting off this merry-go-round!

970
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:15,690
Plexiglass.

971
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:17,930
Had it installed last week.

972
01:10:31,290 --> 01:10:32,930
So, the kid caught a wave.

973
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:37,930
Right now, he and his dingus are on top.

974
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:40,170
Well, this too shall pass.

975
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:44,050
Myrtle J. Mussburger
did not raise her boy to go...

976
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:47,210
...knock-kneed at the first sign of adversity.

977
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:50,050
I say, we made this chump,
we can break him!

978
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:53,570
I say, the higher he climbs,
the harder he drops!

979
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:56,410
I say, yes...

980
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:58,890
...the kid has a future...

981
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:01,450
...and in it...

982
01:11:02,410 --> 01:11:04,330
...I see shame, dishonor...

983
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:06,690
...ignominy, disgrace.

984
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:12,650
The music plays, the wheel turns...

985
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:15,820
...and our spin ain't over yet.

986
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,460
For Pete's sakes, Norville!

987
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:43,620
Where have you been hiding?

988
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:46,980
Do you know what those nincompoops
in the boardroom are doing?

989
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:48,620
I wouldn't call them nincompoops.

990
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:51,060
They're going to discharge 8%
of the workforce here!

991
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,980
In New York City alone,
that means 1,800 people out of work!

992
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:56,380
People with wives, children and families!

993
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:58,740
We're pruning away some of the dead wood.

994
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:00,820
You mean you know about this?

995
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:02,380
Know about it? Sure.

996
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:05,460
You think the board would do anything
without my authorization?

997
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:06,940
It was my idea.

998
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:08,300
-Your...
-Sure it was.

999
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:11,180
We're in a period of transition.
Things have slowed down.

1000
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:13,940
You're being awfully kind to yourself,
Norville Barnes.

1001
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:17,310
You've slowed down, sitting up here
not doing a lick of work.

1002
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:22,510
You haven't come up with an idea since
the Hoop and the reason is plain to see!

1003
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:24,990
You've forgotten what made your ideas
exciting to you.

1004
01:12:25,070 --> 01:12:27,350
It wasn't for the fame and wealth....

1005
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:31,110
Would you get out of here?
You too, sisters, move it. Out!

1006
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:36,310
I've been watching you, even though
you've been trying to avoid me.

1007
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:37,150
Shut up!

1008
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:39,430
Don't think I haven't noticed
how you've changed.

1009
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:41,190
I used to think you were a swell guy.

1010
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:43,230
To be honest,
I thought you were an imbecile.

1011
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:44,390
Shut up!

1012
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:47,910
Then I figured out you were a swell guy.
A little slow maybe, but a swell guy.

1013
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:51,310
Maybe you're not so slow
but you're not so swell either.

1014
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:53,510
Looks like you're an imbecile, after all.
Shut up!

1015
01:12:54,190 --> 01:12:57,510
You haven't talked to me for a week
and now I'm going to say my piece.

1016
01:12:57,550 --> 01:12:59,510
Look, I've never been...

1017
01:13:00,430 --> 01:13:02,910
...dumped by a fella before,
and that hurts...

1018
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:06,030
...but what really hurts is watching you
out-run your soul!

1019
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:08,390
Chasing after money and ease
and the respect of a board...

1020
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:10,750
...that wouldn't give you the time of day...

1021
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:11,750
...if you....

1022
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:13,670
Worked in a watch factory?

1023
01:13:15,150 --> 01:13:16,480
Shut up! Exactly.

1024
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:21,080
Norville, don't you remember
how you used to feel about the Hoop?

1025
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:25,080
You told me you'd bring a smile
to the hips of everyone in America...

1026
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,040
...regardless of race, creed or color.

1027
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:30,600
Finally, there'd be a thingamajig
that would bring everyone together...

1028
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,880
...even if it kept them apart spatially.

1029
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:34,360
"You know...

1030
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:35,840
"...for kids".

1031
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:37,640
Your words...

1032
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:39,760
...not mine.

1033
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,680
I used to love Norville Barnes.

1034
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:45,040
Yes, love him...

1035
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:49,600
...when he was just a swell kid
with hot ideas who was in over his head.

1036
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,520
Now your head's too big to be in over!

1037
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:54,480
Consider this my resignation.

1038
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:57,120
Effective immediately!

1039
01:15:13,890 --> 01:15:15,610
Buddy, buddy.

1040
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:17,490
Buddy.

1041
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:19,660
Oh, buddy.

1042
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:30,340
Buddy. You busy?

1043
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:35,420
Looks like you nodded off there, buddy.
Say, you got a minute?

1044
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:40,180
Is this important?

1045
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:43,420
I think so. It's this little idea
I've been working on.

1046
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:46,060
You see, I don't intend
to be an elevator boy forever.

1047
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:47,660
Take a look at this sweet baby!

1048
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:50,060
Get it? Incredibly convenient, isn't it?

1049
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:51,660
You know, for drinks?

1050
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:55,660
This is how it works. It's got these ridges
on the side that give it its whammy.

1051
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:59,260
You don't have to drink like this.
You can drink like this.

1052
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:01,580
I call it the "Buzz-Sucker".
You get it, buddy?

1053
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:05,380
People are dying for this and
we won't have to charge an arm and a leg.

1054
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:06,620
Wait a minute.

1055
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:22,310
This...

1056
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:26,390
...is worthless!

1057
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:27,750
But, buddy!

1058
01:16:28,070 --> 01:16:30,870
This is the most idiotic thing
I've ever seen in my life.

1059
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:33,190
Nobody wants a hair-brained product
like this.

1060
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:34,310
You see, Buzz...

1061
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:36,390
...it lacks the creative spark...

1062
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:39,630
...the unalloyed genius
that made something like, say...

1063
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:42,070
...the Hula Hoop such a success.

1064
01:16:42,150 --> 01:16:44,510
How dare you barge in here
and take up my valuable time!

1065
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:45,910
I've got a company to run!

1066
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:50,950
I can't have every deadbeat
on the payroll pestering me...

1067
01:16:50,990 --> 01:16:52,670
...with their idiotic brainwaves.

1068
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:53,910
I'm sorry, buddy.

1069
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:55,150
An example must be made!

1070
01:16:55,630 --> 01:16:56,990
What do you mean?

1071
01:16:58,070 --> 01:16:59,190
You're fired!

1072
01:16:59,910 --> 01:17:01,910
Is that plain enough for you?

1073
01:17:07,030 --> 01:17:08,390
Oh, buddy!

1074
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:10,710
And don't call me "buddy"!

1075
01:17:11,470 --> 01:17:15,350
Oh, please, sir! This job running
the elevator, it's all I got!

1076
01:17:15,790 --> 01:17:17,750
It's okay if you don't like the Buzz-Sucker!

1077
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:20,520
Just let me keep my job,
I'm praying to you!

1078
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:22,640
Get out of my office!

1079
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,360
Get up! Up!

1080
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,920
We don't crawl here
at Hudsucker Industries!

1081
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:30,760
I'm sorry, sir!

1082
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:32,040
I'm sorry!

1083
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,320
Thank you, Aloysius.

1084
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:53,360
This is...

1085
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,080
...useful.

1086
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:17,560
I'm sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine
at Riverdale's really murder.

1087
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,570
It's a tough course. A real lollapalooza.

1088
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:24,250
Sit down, son.

1089
01:18:27,490 --> 01:18:31,410
I thought the boardroom would be
a swell place to chat undisturbed.

1090
01:18:32,490 --> 01:18:35,730
Seems we've got some security problems
here at the Hud.

1091
01:18:36,810 --> 01:18:37,690
You don't say.

1092
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:41,890
Ordinarily, I wouldn't bother you with it,
but this is embarrassing.

1093
01:18:43,210 --> 01:18:45,290
It concerns you directly.

1094
01:18:45,610 --> 01:18:48,090
-How's that?
-It's not serious in itself.

1095
01:18:48,730 --> 01:18:51,370
Some elevator boy that you'd fired
came to me...

1096
01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:55,610
...claiming that you'd stolen
the idea for the dingus.

1097
01:18:55,930 --> 01:18:57,530
You'd stolen it from him.

1098
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:02,890
-Maybe I was a little rough on him...
-Forget it.

1099
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:06,450
You don't have to explain to me.
He's a little person. He's nothing.

1100
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:08,010
Fire whoever you want.

1101
01:19:09,930 --> 01:19:11,650
No, the problem is...

1102
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:13,570
...who you hired.

1103
01:19:14,010 --> 01:19:15,050
That dame.

1104
01:19:15,490 --> 01:19:17,010
A spy, as it turns out.

1105
01:19:17,890 --> 01:19:20,570
She must have gotten
to that elevator schnook...

1106
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:23,340
...and her paper is going to town.

1107
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:28,620
Sure, sure, we tried to kill the story,
but the Argus won't play ball.

1108
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:33,460
The problem the board will have is
you hired this woman...

1109
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:35,460
...and you kept her on...

1110
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:38,180
...while she was making
a chump out of you.

1111
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:40,420
Serious error in judgement.

1112
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:43,420
Business is war, kid.

1113
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,900
Take no prisoners, give no second chances.

1114
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:52,940
When the board meets after New Year's...

1115
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:54,540
...your position....

1116
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:58,820
Looks like you're finished.

1117
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:00,580
Washed up.

1118
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:07,980
Fourteenth hole at Riverdale...

1119
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:09,860
...some use a mashie...

1120
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:11,500
...some use a niblick.

1121
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:13,460
Niblick.

1122
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:16,180
You get more loft, more backspin.

1123
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:21,980
That dame...

1124
01:20:23,390 --> 01:20:25,670
...she got your throat pretty well slit.

1125
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:28,670
When you're dead, you stay dead.

1126
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:31,870
You don't believe me,
ask Waring Hudsucker.

1127
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:35,350
Tough luck, kid.

1128
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:37,630
You had a short climb up.

1129
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:40,190
It's a long way down.

1130
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:55,790
-You can't print that!
-We are! She hits the streets tonight.

1131
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:58,390
And she's dynamite!

1132
01:20:58,470 --> 01:21:02,430
But it's the bunk! Norville showed me his
design for the whatsit the day I met him.

1133
01:21:02,510 --> 01:21:05,190
Buzz couldn't have invented it.
Look at him, he's an imbecile.

1134
01:21:05,270 --> 01:21:09,030
Aren't you a broken record?
Gunderson did design it. He's a prodigy.

1135
01:21:09,150 --> 01:21:11,510
-Says who?
-You're not the only one with sources.

1136
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:14,070
Smith has a senior source
on the Hud Board. Very senior.

1137
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:16,430
I bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger.

1138
01:21:17,150 --> 01:21:19,710
You lost it. You gone soft,
by the looks of it.

1139
01:21:19,790 --> 01:21:21,310
Soft on the dummy from Dubuque.

1140
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:23,600
-Muncie.
-Whatever!

1141
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:27,400
This story's hot and you're no longer
on top of it. It's the scoop of the century!

1142
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:29,560
The other papers won't have this
till tomorrow!

1143
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:33,400
Allemeinisher Zeitung, Le Figaro
will be choking on our dust come morning.

1144
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,760
You're fools, both of you!
You're being used, don't you see?

1145
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:39,880
Take a break. You worked hard on this.
You broke it for us.

1146
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:42,280
But it's passed you by
and Smith's taking up the slack.

1147
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:45,760
You want slack...

1148
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,640
...I'll give you slack!

1149
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:51,960
You're not putting me out to pasture!
I quit! Consider this my resignation!

1150
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:54,680
Effective immediately!

1151
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:58,280
Soft.

1152
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:08,720
So, tell me...

1153
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:11,680
...why do you feel this woman
betrayed you?

1154
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:15,480
What's the difference?

1155
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:18,200
The whole world, it seems, is against you?

1156
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:19,480
I don't know.

1157
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,280
Und the elevator boy...

1158
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:24,450
...Buzz, he too works against you?

1159
01:22:26,610 --> 01:22:27,610
Classic.

1160
01:22:27,970 --> 01:22:31,090
Patient displayed listlessness, apathy,
gloomy indifference...

1161
01:22:31,170 --> 01:22:32,930
...und was blue und mopey.

1162
01:22:33,410 --> 01:22:36,890
When asked what the Rorschach stains
represented, patient replied:

1163
01:22:36,970 --> 01:22:40,890
"Nothing much. I don't know.
Just a blotch. Sure beats me".

1164
01:22:41,610 --> 01:22:44,730
Patient shows no ambition,
no get-up-and-go, no vim.

1165
01:22:45,410 --> 01:22:47,610
He is riding the grand loopen-ze-loop...

1166
01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:50,810
...that goes from the height
of delusional gaiety...

1167
01:22:50,890 --> 01:22:52,610
...to the trough of despair.

1168
01:22:53,130 --> 01:22:55,810
He is now near,
but not yet at his lowest point.

1169
01:22:56,170 --> 01:23:00,450
When he reaches bottom, he may erupt
und pose a danger to himself...

1170
01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:01,610
...and others.

1171
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:03,850
Diagnosis, Dr. Bromfenbrenner?

1172
01:23:04,090 --> 01:23:06,970
Patient is eine manic-depressive paranoid,
type B...

1173
01:23:07,130 --> 01:23:08,850
...with acute schizoid tendencies.

1174
01:23:09,210 --> 01:23:10,890
So, patient is...?

1175
01:23:12,490 --> 01:23:13,530
Precisely.

1176
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:15,170
Nuts!

1177
01:23:15,610 --> 01:23:16,770
Prescription?

1178
01:23:16,970 --> 01:23:18,850
Three things: Commitment...

1179
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:21,610
...electroconvulsive therapy...

1180
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:24,090
...maintenance in eine secure facility.

1181
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:41,380
Yeah, he's a tall guy. A real mess.

1182
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:46,540
Look, you better get down here.
He says he's a friend of yours.

1183
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:49,460
He didn't say.
But, man, is he from Squaresville.

1184
01:23:57,740 --> 01:23:59,060
I want a martini!

1185
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:01,940
It's New Year's Eve. I deserve a martini.

1186
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:04,060
It's like I've been telling you...

1187
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:06,220
I thought you served misfits here!

1188
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:08,740
That's a roger. But we don't sell alcohol.

1189
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:11,540
What kind of bar doesn't serve martinis?

1190
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:15,180
It's a juice-and-coffee bar, man,
like I've been telling you.

1191
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:17,380
Right. So, I want...

1192
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:19,820
...a martini.

1193
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:23,500
I've had a martini in every bar
on the way down here.

1194
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:26,020
Martinis are for squares, man.

1195
01:24:27,950 --> 01:24:30,630
What'd you call me, you beatnik son of a...

1196
01:24:36,510 --> 01:24:37,830
Look who's here:

1197
01:24:37,950 --> 01:24:39,190
Amy Archer...

1198
01:24:39,470 --> 01:24:41,070
...Prizeter Pule winner.

1199
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:43,870
Looking for a nitwit to buy you lunch?

1200
01:24:44,790 --> 01:24:46,950
-Bar fella, I'd like...
-I'm sorry.

1201
01:24:47,630 --> 01:24:48,990
...a martini, please.

1202
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:51,350
I tried to tell you so many times, I....

1203
01:24:52,710 --> 01:24:54,110
It's hard to admit...

1204
01:24:54,150 --> 01:24:55,910
...when you've been wrong.

1205
01:24:56,510 --> 01:24:57,910
If you could just...

1206
01:24:58,310 --> 01:25:00,070
...find it in your heart...

1207
01:25:00,670 --> 01:25:02,470
...to give me another chance.

1208
01:25:04,830 --> 01:25:07,190
"You take no prisoners,
give no second chances".

1209
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:10,030
Please, Norville!
Please give me one more chance!

1210
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:12,030
And yourself, too!

1211
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:13,910
We both deserve one.

1212
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:17,630
Just give us a second chance.
Together we can fight this thing.

1213
01:25:17,790 --> 01:25:21,750
I know the last story was a lie
and we can prove it. Release a statement!

1214
01:25:21,790 --> 01:25:24,670
-I can help you write it!
-What's the difference?

1215
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:26,630
I'm all washed up.

1216
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:28,960
Extinct.

1217
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:31,480
Homo sapiens sapicus.

1218
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:36,320
That just about does it.

1219
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:40,440
I've seen Norville Barnes,
the young man in a big hurry...

1220
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:44,000
...and I've seen Norville Barnes,
the self-important heel.

1221
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,120
But I've never seen Norville Barnes,
the quitter...

1222
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:49,440
...and I don't like it.

1223
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,560
"Fight on

1224
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,960
"Fight on, dear old Muncie

1225
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:00,560
"Fight on
Hoist the gold and blue

1226
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:04,880
"You'll be tattered, torn and hurting

1227
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:09,080
"Once the Munce is done with you

1228
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,040
"Go...

1229
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:14,240
"...Eagles! "

1230
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:19,520
You can't surrender, Norville! Remember:

1231
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:21,560
"Fight on

1232
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,200
"Fight on

1233
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,600
"Dear old Muncie

1234
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:27,400
"Fight on

1235
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:30,890
"Hoist the gold and blue

1236
01:26:31,930 --> 01:26:34,010
"You'll be tattered, torn...

1237
01:26:34,090 --> 01:26:36,010
"...and hurting...".

1238
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:38,930
You lied to me.

1239
01:26:39,690 --> 01:26:41,290
How could you lie to me?

1240
01:26:43,330 --> 01:26:44,290
You...

1241
01:26:44,970 --> 01:26:46,250
...a Muncie girl.

1242
01:26:48,090 --> 01:26:49,850
But, Norville, l...

1243
01:26:50,730 --> 01:26:52,650
"When you're dead, you stay dead! "

1244
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:54,290
Just ask...

1245
01:26:54,370 --> 01:26:56,010
...Waring Hudsucker!

1246
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:04,410
Extra, extra!

1247
01:27:04,530 --> 01:27:06,250
New Year's Eve edition!

1248
01:27:06,330 --> 01:27:08,690
Barnes' brain caught red-handed!

1249
01:27:08,810 --> 01:27:10,170
Ideas ersatz!

1250
01:27:10,610 --> 01:27:13,210
Man from Muncie a moron after all!

1251
01:27:13,570 --> 01:27:15,610
Read all about it!

1252
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:19,930
New Year's Eve edition!
Man from Muncie a moron after all!

1253
01:27:20,090 --> 01:27:22,250
You're not so slow, but you're not so swell.

1254
01:27:22,290 --> 01:27:24,890
And it looks like you're an imbecile
after all.

1255
01:27:25,330 --> 01:27:27,570
But your friends called you "dope?"

1256
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:29,780
"Dipstick?" "Lamebrain?" "Schmo?"

1257
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:32,900
Please, buddy, running the elevator,
it's all I got.

1258
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:35,020
Norville, you let me down.

1259
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:39,380
You let Mrs. Eisenhower down.
You let the American people down.

1260
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:41,940
And when you're dead, you stay dead.

1261
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:47,300
The kid is screwy, it's official.

1262
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:51,500
The barred-window boys
are out looking for him now.

1263
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:53,700
We'll see how Wall Street likes the news...

1264
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:57,020
...that the president of Hudsucker
is heading for the booby hatch.

1265
01:27:58,660 --> 01:28:01,220
When Doc Bromfenbrenner gets through
with him...

1266
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:03,580
...he'll need diapers and a dribble cup.

1267
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:07,180
If that's all....

1268
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:09,140
Long live the Hud!

1269
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:19,980
Watch where you're...

1270
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:21,620
Hiya, buddy!

1271
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:24,580
Out on the town? Guess what?

1272
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:27,420
Mr.... Sid says I can have my old job back!

1273
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:29,340
I deserve a second chance, he says.

1274
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:30,310
He did?

1275
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:32,710
Turns out he's not such a bad guy after all.

1276
01:28:33,270 --> 01:28:34,670
That's wonderful.

1277
01:28:35,150 --> 01:28:38,590
He said you stole that swell hoop idea
from me. What gives?

1278
01:28:38,790 --> 01:28:39,990
I would never...

1279
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:41,790
Gee, that was a swell idea.

1280
01:28:42,630 --> 01:28:44,310
And Sid says you stoled it!

1281
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:47,110
What are you waiting for? Pop him one!

1282
01:28:57,230 --> 01:28:58,910
He's that big-shot faker!

1283
01:28:58,950 --> 01:29:00,710
That Wall Street fraud!

1284
01:29:00,830 --> 01:29:02,590
Nuttier than a fruitcake!

1285
01:29:03,910 --> 01:29:05,470
Somebody call the cops!

1286
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:37,960
Ring out the old, ring in the new!

1287
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:11,440
Strictly speaking, I'm never supposed
to do this...

1288
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:13,440
...but have you got a better idea?

1289
01:35:18,810 --> 01:35:21,050
Love that tune. How you doing, kid?

1290
01:35:22,090 --> 01:35:23,370
Mr. Hudsucker?

1291
01:35:24,530 --> 01:35:27,210
How do you like that thing?
They're all wearing them upstairs.

1292
01:35:27,290 --> 01:35:28,330
It's a fad.

1293
01:35:28,570 --> 01:35:29,570
Anyway...

1294
01:35:30,050 --> 01:35:31,450
...I see you've been having some...

1295
01:35:31,530 --> 01:35:33,050
...problems with the board.

1296
01:35:33,210 --> 01:35:35,650
I guess Sidney's been putting
the screws to you, Norman.

1297
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:37,300
Norville.

1298
01:35:37,660 --> 01:35:40,740
Say what you like about his ethics,
he's a balls-to-the-wall businessman.

1299
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:43,980
Beat you any way he can.
Straight for the jugular. Very effective.

1300
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:47,140
Any particular reason you didn't give him
my blue letter?

1301
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:50,660
Norman, just a dying man's last words
and wishes, no big deal.

1302
01:35:52,020 --> 01:35:53,540
I must've mislaid it.

1303
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:56,420
It's in your apron pocket,
right where you left it.

1304
01:35:56,860 --> 01:35:57,820
Imbecile.

1305
01:35:57,940 --> 01:36:00,860
Failure to deliver a blue letter
is grounds for dismissal.

1306
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:05,300
It's New Year's. I'm not going to add
to your woes.

1307
01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:07,740
Want to read it?
You might learn something.

1308
01:36:08,140 --> 01:36:10,620
Might keep you from jumping
out of any more windows.

1309

"Blue letter from the desk
of Waring Hudsucker...

"Of the years you and I have spent..."

1316

Standard resignation boilerplate.
Go down to the second paragraph.

"You will no doubt be wondering
why I've decided...

The New Year.

1369
01:40:46,870 --> 01:40:51,110
When he learned that Norville owned
the company, Sidney was upset at first.

1370
01:40:51,550 --> 01:40:54,230
It's a good thing Doc Bromfenbrenner
was there...

1371
01:40:55,230 --> 01:40:58,510
...because he was able to keep Sidney
from harming himself.

1372
01:40:58,910 --> 01:41:02,790
He prescribed a long rest in the sana....
In the sanatory....

1373
01:41:03,110 --> 01:41:04,430
In the booby hatch.

1374
01:41:05,550 --> 01:41:06,830
Now, Norville...

1375
01:41:07,470 --> 01:41:10,390
...he went on and ruled
with wisdom and compassion...

1376
01:41:11,070 --> 01:41:14,230
...and started dreaming up
them exciting new ideas again.

1377
01:41:14,830 --> 01:41:16,190
You know, for kids.

1378
01:41:16,390 --> 01:41:19,110
I had the boys down at R&D
throw together this prototype...

1379
01:41:19,190 --> 01:41:20,990
...so our discussion could have focus...

1380
01:41:21,070 --> 01:41:23,790
...and to give you gentlemen of the board
a firsthand look.

1381
01:41:28,990 --> 01:41:33,150
That's the story of how Norville Barnes
climbed way up...

1382
01:41:33,270 --> 01:41:35,990
...to the 44th floor
of the Hudsucker building...

1383
01:41:36,670 --> 01:41:40,510
...and then fell all the way down,
but didn't quite squish himself.

1384
01:41:41,510 --> 01:41:45,040
You know, they say there was a man
who jumped from the 45th floor.

1385
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:47,520
But that's another story.
