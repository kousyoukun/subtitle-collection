1
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:39,622
MAN: That's right.

2
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,916
New York.

3
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,919
It's 1958.

4
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:49,298
Anyway, for a few more minutes it is.

5
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:53,261
Come midnight, it's gonna be 1959.

6
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,473
A whole other feeling. The new year.

7
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,600
The future.

8
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:05,273
Yeah, Old Daddy Earth fixing to start one more trip around the sun.

9
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:09,318
Everybody hoping this ride round be a little more giddy...

10
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,571
...a little more gay.

11
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,159
Yup, all over town, champagne corks is a-popping.

12
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:22,373
Over in the Waldorf, the big shots is dancing to the strains of Guy Lombardo.

13
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:28,546
In Times Square, the little folks is watching and waiting for that big ball to drop.

14
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:33,217
They're all trying to catch hold of one moment of time...

15
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:39,390
...to be able to say, "Right now! This is it! I got it!"

16
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,644
Of course, by then it'll be past.

17
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:49,275
But they're all happy, everybody having a good time.

18
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:52,195
Well, almost everybody.

19
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:56,491
There's a few lost souls floating around out there.

20
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,536
Now, if you all ain't from the city...

21
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:04,248
...we got something here called "the rat race."

22
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:08,753
Got a way of chewing folks up so that they don't want no celebrating...

23
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,130
...don't want no cheering up.

24
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,008
Don't care nothing about no New Year's.

25
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:19,722
Out of hope, out of rope, out of time.

26
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,601
This here is Norville Barnes.

27
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,437
That office he's stepping out of...

28
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:30,316
...is the oddice of the president of Hudsucker Industries.

29
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,443
That's his office.

30
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,822
How'd he get so high?

31
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:39,033
And why's he feeling so low?

32
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,203
Is he really going to do it?

33
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:46,582
Is Norville really gonna jelly up the sidewalk?

34
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:52,296
Well, the future, that's something you can never tell about.

35
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,467
But the past, heh-heh...

36
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,554
...that's another story.

37
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,656
In the third quarter we saw no signs of weakening.

38
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,951
We're up 18 percent over last year's third-quarter gross...

39
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,578
...and that, needless to say, is a new record.

40
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:34,375
Our competition continues to flag and we continue to take up the slack.

41
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,211
Market shares in most divisions is increasing...

42
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:40,715
...and we have opened seven new regional offices.

43
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,300
Our international division...

44
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,637
...is also showing vigorous signs of upward movement for the last six months...

45
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,141
...and we're looking at some exciting things in R&D.

46
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:33,809
Sub-franchising. Don't talk to me about sub-franchising.

47
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,270
We're making so much money in sub-franchising...

48
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,147
...it isn't even funny.

49
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:42,360
Our nominees and assigns continue to multiply and expand...

50
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:46,197
...extending our influence nationally and abroad.

51
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,699
Our owned and operateds are performing...

52
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,161
...far beyond our expectations both here and abroad.

53
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,914
And the Federal Tax Act of 1958...

54
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:59,794
...is giving us a swell write-off on our plant and heavies.

55
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:28,364
And our last debenture issue was this year's fastest seller.

56
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,283
So third quarter and year-to-date...

57
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:35,287
...we have set a new record in sales, a new record in gross...

58
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,165
...a new record in pre-tax earnings...

59
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,460
...a new record in after-tax profits...

60
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,547
...and our stock has split twice in the past year.

61
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,132
In short...

62
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,513
...we're loaded.

63
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,358
Mr. Hudsucker?

64
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,085
[BELL TOLLING]

65
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:35,259
It's a pity to waste a whole Montecristo.

66
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,844
He could've opened the window.

67
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,763
Waring Hudsucker never did anything the easy way.

68
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:44,018
Why? Why did he do it? Everything was going so well.

69
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:47,104
What, am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.

70
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,148
[SOBBING] He didn't look unhappy.

71
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:53,819
- He didn't look rich. - He was never an easy man to figure out.

72
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,739
He built this company with his bare hands.

73
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:59,908
Every step he took was a step up...

74
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,994
...except, of course, this last one.

75
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,330
Sure, sure he was a swell fella...

76
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,832
...but when the president, chairman of the board...

77
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,336
...and owner of 87 percent of the company stock drops...

78
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,796
...44 floors... - Forty-five.

79
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,214
Counting the mezzanine.

80
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,134
Then the company, too, has a problem. Stillson!

81
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,930
What exactly is the disposition of Waring's stock?

82
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,557
Well, as you know...

83
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,643
...Hud left no will and no family.

84
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,729
The company bylaws are quite clear in that event.

85
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,358
"His entire portfolio will be converted into common stock...

86
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:36,904
...and will be sold over the counter as of the first of the fiscal year...

87
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,406
...following his demise." - Meaning?

88
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:43,118
Meaning simply that Waring's stock and control of the company...

89
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:46,789
...will be made available to the public January 1st.

90
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,667
Do you mean to say...

91
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:53,504
...that any slob in a smelly T-shirt will be able to buy Hudsucker stock?

92
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,714
The company bylaws are quite clear.

93
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,841
My God! You're animals!

94
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:02,262
How can you discuss his stock when the man has just leapt 45 floors?

95
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,015
- Forty four. - Not counting the mezzanine.

96
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,267
Quit showboating, Addison. The man is gone.

97
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,646
The question now is whether we'll let John Q. Public waltz in here...

98
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,816
...and buy our company. - What are you suggesting, Sydney?

99
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,111
Certainly we can't afford to buy a controlling interest.

100
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,613
Not while the stock is this strong.

101
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,908
How soon before Hud's paper hits the market?

102
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,284
- January 1st. - Thirty days.

103
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,161
- Four weeks. - A month at the most.

104
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:29,498
One month to make the blue-chip investment of the century...

105
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,084
...look like a round-trip ticket on the Titanic.

106
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,545
We play up the fact that Hud is dead.

107
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,422
ALL: Long live the Hud!

108
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,591
- We depress the stock. - To the point where we can buy 50 percent.

109
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,802
- Fifty one. - Not counting the mezzanine.

110
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,387
- It could work. - It should work.

111
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,223
- It would work. - It's working already.

112
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:51,270
Waring Hudsucker is abstract art on Madison Avenue.

113
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:55,983
What we need now is a new president who will inspire panic in the stockholder.

114
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,484
- A puppet. - A proxy.

115
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,111
MAN: A pawn.

116
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,573
Sure, sure, some jerk...

117
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,159
...we can really push around.

118
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:10,038
You punch in at 8:30 every morning, at 7:30 following a business holiday...

119
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,499
...unless it's a Monday, then you punch in 8:00.

120
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,919
- Punch in late and they dock you. MAN: This goes to seven! Urgent.

121
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,715
Incoming articles get a voucher. Outgoing articles provide a voucher.

122
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,342
Move any article without a voucher and they dock you!

123
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,970
Take this up to the secretarial pool on three! ASAP!

124
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,890
Letter-size, a green voucher! Folder-size, a yellow voucher!

125
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:31,310
- Parcel-size, a maroon voucher! - This is for Morgatross! Chop-chop!

126
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,521
Wrong color voucher and they dock you!

127
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,107
6-7-8-7-0-4-9-Alpha-6!

128
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,486
That is your employee number! It will not be repeated!

129
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:43,322
Without your employee number you cannot get your paycheck.

130
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,865
All right, this goes up to 27!

131
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,868
Return a waiver! Do not return without a signed waiver!

132
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:52,289
Inter-office mail is code 37! Intra-office mail is 37-3.

133
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,666
Outside mail is 3-37.

134
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,460
Code it wrong and they dock you!

135
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,630
I was supposed to have this on 2810 minutes ago!

136
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,256
This has been your orientation.

137
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:04,468
Is there anything you do not understand or understand partially?

138
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,347
If you have not been fully orientated, you must file a complaint with Personnel!

139
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,391
File a faulty complaint and they dock you!

140
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:20,734
Kloppitt. Kloppitt, Kloppitt...

141
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,319
Max Kloppitt.

142
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,655
"Max Kloppitt, Jr."

143
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,750
What do you do when the envelope is too big for the slot?

144
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,212
Well, if you fold them, they fire you.

145
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,675
I usually throw them out.

146
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,891
- Just got hired today. OLD MAN: Mm-hm.

147
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,686
- Terrific. NORVILLE: You know, entry level.

148
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,604
OLD MAN: Tell me about it.

149
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,400
But I got big ideas.

150
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,694
I'm sure you do.

151
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,739
For instance, take a look at this sweet baby.

152
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,953
I developed it myself.

153
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,789
Yes, sirree, this is my ticket upstairs.

154
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,961
You know, for kids.

155
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,255
Terrific.

156
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,466
So you see, I won't be working in the mail room long.

157
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,761
No, I don't guess you will be.

158
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,931
- How long you been here? - Forty-eight years.

159
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:37,811
Next year they move me up to parcels if I'm lucky.

160
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,105
MAN [ON PA]: Attention Hudsucker employees!

161
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:42,482
Attention Hudsucker employees!

162
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:46,403
We regretfully announce that at 30 seconds after the hour of noon...

163
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:47,696
...Hudsucker time...

164
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:50,657
...Waring Hudsucker, founder, president...

165
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,660
...and chairman of the board of Hudsucker Industries...

166
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,203
...merged with the infinite.

167
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:58,373
To mark this occasion of corporate loss...

168
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:03,128
...we ask that all employees observe a moment of silent contemplation.

169
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,470
MAN [ON PA]: Thank you for your kind attention.

170
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,514
This moment has been duly noted on your timecards...

171
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:18,185
...and will be deducted from your pay. That is all.

172
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,857
- Blue letter! - Blue letter!

173
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,776
They're bringing down a blue letter!

174
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,478
OLD MAN: It's a blue letter.

175
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,855
Top, top level.

176
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,733
Confidential communication between the brass.

177
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,569
Usually bad news.

178
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,905
They hate blue letters upstairs.

179
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:18,120
- Hate them. - You!

180
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,456
Yeah, you! Barnes! You don't look busy!

181
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,334
Think you can handle a blue letter?

182
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,212
This letter was sent this morning by the big man himself...

183
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,006
...that's right, Waring Hudsucker!

184
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,759
It's addressed to Sid Mussburger, Hudsucker's right-hand man!

185
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,511
It's a blue letter!

186
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,931
That means you got to put it right in Mussburger's hands.

187
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,350
No secretaries! No receptionists!

188
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,520
No colleagues! No excuses!

189
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,230
Mussburger!

190
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:51,111
Hi, my name's Buzz, I got the fuzz, I make the elevator do what she does.

191
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,322
Hang it up to dry. What's your pleasure, buddy?

192
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,242
- Forty-four. - Forty-four, the top-brass floor.

193
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:00,203
Say, buddy, what takes 50 years to get to the top floor...

194
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,164
...and 30 seconds to get down?

195
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,708
Waring Hudsucker! You get it, buddy?

196
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,420
Say, buddy! Mr. Kline, up to nine. Mrs. Dell, Personnel.

197
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,297
- Mr. Levin, 37. - Thirty-six.

198
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,175
Walk down! Ladies and gentlemen, please step to the rear.

199
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:16,636
- Here comes the gargantuan Mr. Grier. - Buzz.

200
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:20,766
Say, buddy, who's the most liquid businessman on the street?

201
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,226
Waring Hudsucker. Say, buddy.

202
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:27,481
When is the sidewalk fully dressed? When it's wearing Hudsucker! Ha-ha-ha.

203
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,692
You get it, buddy? It's a pun, it's a knee-slapper...

204
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:34,154
...it's a play on... Jesus, Joseph and Mary, is that a blue letter?

205
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:39,451
Why didn't you tell a guy? Hold on, folks, we're express to the top floor!

206
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,759
Good luck, buddy.

207
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,680
You're gonna need it. Ha-ha-ha.

208
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,486
Mr. Mussburger's office?

209
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,753
[IN SOFT VOICE] Hello.

210
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:17,716
- Do you have an appointment? - No.

211
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:22,012
- Shall we look in the book? Hmm? - Ma'am, we shall...

212
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,265
- We don't seem to be in the book. - I wouldn't be.

213
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:29,436
If we had an appointment, we'd be in the book.

214
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,188
[PANTING] I have this, uh...

215
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,522
Oh, here it is. Heh.

216
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,905
MUSSBURGER: Gambotz?

217
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,448
Harry Gambotz?

218
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,035
No, too risky. He's green but he's not slow.

219
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:46,953
Who is he?

220
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,998
No, I want an imbecile, not a cipher or you'd have the job.

221
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,167
Nuh-nuh.

222
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,461
They moved him to grommets and O-rings.

223
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,129
He's doing pretty well.

224
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,633
No, no, not, McClanahan.

225
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:02,886
He bungled the Teleyard merger, thinks he's got something to prove.

226
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,846
Who let you in?

227
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:08,642
Atwater? Tremendous. Except I just fired him last week.

228
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,227
WOMAN [OVER INTERCOM]: Mr. Mussburger...

229
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,895
...Mr. Bumstead's waiting downstairs.

230
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,189
- I'll be right there. WOMAN: Yes, Mr. Mussburger.

231
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,482
Spit it out!

232
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,567
- I, uh... - Yeah?

233
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,195
Well, maybe you're the company's biggest moron.

234
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:24,032
We can't use Morris. Been here too long. He's a nice guy with too many friends.

235
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:27,494
In fact, why don't you fire him? Scratch that, I'll fire him.

236
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,454
Make it fast, huh, fast!

237
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:31,539
WOMAN [OVER INTERCOM]: Mr. Bumstead is growing restless.

238
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,917
MUSSBURGER: Tell him I'll be right there. Give him a magazine.

239
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,543
What, are you a mute?

240
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,547
How's the stock doing? Bad?

241
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,676
Well, it's not bad enough. Listen, chump.

242
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:46,930
Either you find me a ding-dong or tender your key to the executive washroom.

243
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,684
That goes double for you, pal. Ear-clay? Ood-gay!

244
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,524
This better be good. I'm in a bad mood.

245
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:01,778
Sir, I've got something for you from the mail room, but first...

246
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:06,950
...if I could take a minute of your very valuable time to show you something...

247
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,328
...I've been working on for the past two or three years.

248
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:18,712
You know, for kids.

249
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:22,632
It's perfect for Hudsucker, not that I'm any great genius.

250
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,051
They say inspiration is 99 percent perspiration...

251
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,137
...in my case it's at least twice that...

252
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,056
...but I've got to tell you, this sweet... - Wait a minute!

253
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:39,774
Huh.

254
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:57,917
Hmm.

255
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,353
Sit down, son.

256
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,106
Go ahead.

257
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,234
Try it on.

258
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:37,290
Put your feet up.

259
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,545
Go ahead.

260
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:48,134
Let's get to know one another, shall we?

261
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,637
Let's chat.

262
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,599
Man-to-man.

263
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:04,234
Now then, you're from the basement, aren't you?

264
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,363
And weren't blessed with much...

265
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:10,990
...education?

266
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,993
Well, I am a college graduate.

267
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,621
But you did not excel in your studies.

268
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:19,499
- Well, I... I made Dean's List. - Oh.

269
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,918
At the Muncie College of Business Administration.

270
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,798
And your friends, they called you "jerk," didn't they?

271
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,049
Mm, unh-uhn.

272
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:30,135
- "Dope?" "Dipstick?" - Mm-mm. No.

273
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:32,846
"Lamebrain?" "Schmo?" Not even behind your back?

274
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,849
Well, as a matter they voted me "Most Likely to Succeed."

275
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,308
You're fired.

276
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:43,022
Get your feet off my desk, get out of my office.

277
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,150
Leave your apron in the locker room.

278
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,359
Oh, my God!

279
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:50,947
The Bumstead contract. I've been working on that deal for four years!

280
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,199
Get out of here! I'll take care of it! Get out.

281
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:57,120
You could have destroyed the most sensitive document of my career.

282
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,747
WOMAN: Mr. Bumstead is threatening to leave the building.

283
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:01,082
I'm on my way down.

284
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,877
We need the first page of the contract retyped.

285
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,713
WOMAN: Yes, Mr. Mussburger.

286
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:10,133
Yeah? Uh-huh. Yeah.

287
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,968
Out! Out of the office!

288
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,972
Down three points, huh?

289
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,516
That's encouraging. How about New York?

290
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:21,519
Not that way, through the door!

291
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:24,230
WOMAN: Sir, it'll take three hours to retype the Bumstead contract...

292
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:28,026
MUSSBURGER: Where are you going? Get out of here! Stop that!

293
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,944
WOMAN: Mr. Bumstead's threatening to leave.

294
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:31,237
Not the whole contract, just the first page.

295
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:34,491
I'll be there. Give him another magazine.

296
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,701
WOMAN: He says he'll leave. MUSSBURGER: I said I'll be there!

297
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:38,912
And you're wife's been trying to reach you.

298
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:42,332
Up on your feet! We don't crawl here at Hudsucker Industries!

299
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,125
- My leg is on fire! - No assumptions!

300
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:48,588
It's early yet. Just let me know where we stand at the closing bell.

301
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,766
Oh, my God, the Bumstead contract!

302
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,148
No magazines! No coffee!

303
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:12,278
Mussburger! I wanna see Mussburger! Or did he jump out a window too?

304
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:16,574
Don't worry, Mr. Mussburger, I got you! I got you by your pants.

305
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,329
Pants?

306
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,836
Mr. Mussburger, I'm gonna give your pants a nice double stitch.

307
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:33,925
It'll make them real strong and you're gonna look real sharp.

308
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:39,264
- No, single stitch is fine. - But the double stitch, she lasts forever.

309
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:43,893
Why on earth would I want a double stitch?

310
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,812
To pad your account.

311
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,814
Single stitch is fine.

312
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,446
Damn!

313
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:05,206
Oh, what the heck! Mr. Mussburger is such a nice man...

314
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:08,543
...I'm gonna give him a double stitch anyway. Heh-heh-heh.

315
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:12,797
Ah. That's some strong stitch, you bet!

316
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,739
AL: "The Einstein of Enterprise."

317
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:04,325
"The Edison of Industry."

318
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:07,578
"The Billion-Dollar Cranium!"

319
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:11,165
"Idea Man!"

320
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,544
And not one of you has given me a story on him!

321
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,587
Bunch of lamebrains!

322
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:19,132
Facts, figures, charts. They never sold a newspaper!

323
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:21,926
I read this morning's Argus, let me tell you something.

324
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,804
I'd wrap a fish in it! I'd use it as kindling!

325
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,598
I'd train my poodle on it if he wasn't a French poodle...

326
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:29,517
...and partial to pages of Paris-Soir.

327
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:32,645
But I wouldn't shell out a hard-earned nickel to read the thing!

328
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:34,772
Come on, chief, give us a break.

329
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:37,817
Sure, Tibbs. Take a break.

330
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,570
Go to Florida. Lie in the sun.

331
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,364
Wait for a coconut to drop. File a story on it.

332
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:46,784
It'd be more of a grabber than your piece on the county grain surplus!

333
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:49,662
The human angle! That's what sells papers!

334
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:53,166
We need a front page with a heart and the Idea Man can put it there!

335
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,001
Look, chief, if we had more access...

336
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,754
If a frog had wings it wouldn't bump it's ass a-hopping.

337
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,756
I don't want excuses, I want results!

338
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,508
What makes the Idea Man tick? Where's he from?

339
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:06,345
I want to know everything about him! Has he got a girl? Has he got parents?

340
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,598
Everybody has parents.

341
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,850
All right, how many?

342
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:14,520
How about it, Parkinson? You've been awful quiet over there.

343
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,856
- Uh... - Still waters run deep.

344
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,692
Only thing deep with Parkinson are the holes in his ears.

345
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:21,736
Yes, Idea Man.

346
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:25,364
What are his hopes and dreams, his desires and aspirations?

347
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:28,201
Does he think all the time or a certain portion of the day?

348
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,578
How tall is he? Shoe size? Where does he sleep?

349
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:32,205
What does he have for breakfast?

350
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,290
Does he put jam on his toast or doesn't he?

351
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,542
If not, why not and since when?

352
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:38,711
Well?

353
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,714
Ah. You're useless.

354
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:44,717
Yes. Idea Man. "Creator."

355
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:47,970
"Innovator." "Cerebrator."

356
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,889
WOMAN: Fake! - Huh?

357
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,808
I tell you, the guy's a phony.

358
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,559
AL: Phony, huh? - As a three-dollar bill.

359
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,186
- Says who? - Says me, Amy Archer!

360
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,730
Why is he an Idea Man? Because Hudsucker says he is?

361
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,566
What are his ideas? Why can't anyone interview him?

362
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:03,402
Five bucks says she mentions her Pulitzer.

363
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,571
Again? You're on.

364
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:07,824
Just take a look at the mug on this guy.

365
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,785
The jutting eyebrows, the simian forehead, the idiotic grin.

366
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:15,289
He has a face only a mother could love on payday.

367
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:18,084
The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.

368
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,003
Yeah, monkey or not, I'm still editor of this rag.

369
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:24,215
You were doing the piece on the FBI. "Hoover: When Will He Marry?"

370
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,426
- I filed it yesterday. Nice tie, Earl. - Well, do a follow-up.

371
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,554
"Hoover: Crime Buster or Pantywaist?"

372
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:33,266
The rest of you mugs get off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!

373
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:36,185
Al, he's the bunk.

374
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:44,443
- I'll stake my Pulitzer on it! MAN: Hmm.

375
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,281
Say, buddy, where'd you get the new duds?

376
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,784
Say, buddy, how did old bucket butt like his blue letter? Heh.

377
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:55,329
Did he bust a gut? Did he die? Well, hello, Mr. Mussburger.

378
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:58,249
- Lobby, we haven't got all day. - Right away, Mr. Mussburger.

379
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,585
How are you this fine morning, sir?

380
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,713
It's been a pleasure serving you today, sir.

381
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,757
It's been a pleasure serving you too, uh, buddy.

382
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:09,010
Uh, Sid, shouldn't we be a little concerned...

383
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:11,971
...with the downward spiral of our stock these past few days?

384
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,473
You're the expert, but at the Muncie College...

385
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,434
Relax, it's only natural...

386
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,979
...in a period of transition for the more timid element to run for cover.

387
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,647
Like I said, you're the expert...

388
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:24,275
...but do you remember the plan I outlined for you...

389
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,320
...the day I set fire to your office? The day I was promoted?

390
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:32,783
I do remember and I was impressed. But that's all forgotten now.

391
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,369
NORVILLE: Oh. Thank you, Sid.

392
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:39,332
The reason I mention it is it requires such a small capital investment...

393
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,000
Again, you are the expert here.

394
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,419
- But there's such an enormous potential profit...

395
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:46,631
...given the discretionary income of the burgeoning middle-class.

396
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,134
So if you agree, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch.

397
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:51,510
Sure, sure.

398
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,348
Tell whoever you want. I'd like to hear about it at some point too.

399
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:09,195
- I got gas, Benny. - Yeah. Tell me about it.

400
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,365
LOU: No kidding, Benny. I got gas.

401
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:15,910
BENNY: You get the special? LOU: Far from it.

402
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,165
LOU: Enter the dame.

403
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:23,834
BENNY: There's one in every story.

404
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:26,712
LOU: Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.

405
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:30,257
BENNY: Twenty bucks says not here, she don't find one.

406
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:33,219
LOU: She's looking for her mark. BENNY: She finds him.

407
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:38,557
LOU: She sits down and orders a light lunch.

408
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,811
BENNY: How will she pay for this lunch?

409
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,439
LOU: She looks through her purse. BENNY: No money.

410
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:48,150
LOU: The mark notices.

411
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:52,071
- He's not noticing, Benny. BENNY: Maybe he's wise.

412
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,699
LOU: He don't look wise.

413
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:57,326
BENNY: Plan two.

414
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,453
Here come the waterworks.

415
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:01,706
LOU: Yellowstone. BENNY: Old Faithful.

416
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:03,874
LOU: Hello, Niagara.

417
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:06,836
BENNY: He notices. LOU: She's distressed.

418
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,838
BENNY: He's concerned.

419
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,215
LOU: She explains her predicament.

420
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:16,012
LOU AND BENNY [IN UNISON]: And enter the light lunch.

421
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:20,599
BENNY: She's got other problems. LOU: There's illness in the family.

422
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:23,602
BENNY: Her mother needs an operation. LOU: Urgently.

423
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:26,564
BENNY: Adenoids. LOU: No, Benny.

424
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:29,150
Lumbago.

425
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,527
BENNY: That gag's got whiskers on it.

426
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:34,405
LOU: Uh-oh. He ain't biting, Benny.

427
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,616
BENNY: She's losing him, Lou. LOU: Maybe he's wise.

428
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,952
BENNY: He don't look wise.

429
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:42,788
LOU: How does she pull this out? BENNY: He's getting away.

430
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:46,417
LOU: She better think fast. BENNY: She isn't.

431
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,753
LOU AND BENNY [IN UNISON]: She is!

432
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,796
LOU: She's good, Benny.

433
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:53,132
BENNY: She's damn good, Lou.

434
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:56,093
Can I get you boys anything else?

435
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,766
Bromo.

436
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:06,979
AMY: I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible elevator boy.

437
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:10,107
I can't say how much I appreciate your listening to my story.

438
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:14,320
I'm lucky to find someone in this bustling city with a stout heart and a ready ear.

439
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,448
At any rate, there I was traveling this great country.

440
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:18,783
Some I met were kind to me, others exceedingly cruel.

441
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,453
Traveling by motor bus, rail, even by thumb.

442
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:23,954
The couch, please.

443
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:27,583
Hoarding every dollar, counting every nickel, pinching every penny.

444
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,503
It's been a long road leading to the coddee shop downstairs.

445
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:34,090
Not that I'd trade a day, an hour, a moment of it for anything.

446
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,716
I don't know what came over me.

447
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:37,843
It was the shock of eating after so long...

448
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:40,930
...without the enzymes kicking in after so long...

449
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,187
Then you couldn't possibly know what it is to be tired and hungry.

450
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,314
- Hungry, anyway. - I don't wanna bore you...

451
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:52,733
...with all details of my life. Not a happy story.

452
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:55,236
I'm jobless but not for want of trying.

453
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:58,906
I'm friendless, with no one to take care of me and had you not come along...

454
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:01,325
...exactly when you did... NORVILLE: I, myself...

455
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:03,786
At any rate, I arrived in town not 10 days ago...

456
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,331
...full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world...

457
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:08,791
...a little naive perhaps...

458
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,043
...but armed with determination, work ethic...

459
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:12,711
...and a belief in the future...

460
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,880
- I, myself... AMY: Only to have that belief...

461
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:18,342
...that unsullied optimism, dashed against the marble of the workplace.

462
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:21,554
Such is life. Seek and you shall find. Work and you shall prosper.

463
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:23,222
- Cigarette? - No, thank you.

464
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,808
Seek and you shall find, work and you shall prosper.

465
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,227
These were the watchwords of my education...

466
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,187
...the values instilled in me...

467
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:33,524
...while I was growing up in a little town you've never heard of.

468
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,234
- Mind if I join you? - Be my guest.

469
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,528
A little town you've probably never heard of...

470
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,530
...a dusty crossroads of which you've probably never heard.

471
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,119
Excuse me. Executive washroom.

472
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:49,415
Are you all right?

473
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:54,461
Is it your lunch?
The chicken à la king?

474
00:36:56,590 --> 00:37:01,635
- No, I'm fine. You were saying?
- Is the à la king repeating on you?

475
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,471
Uh...

476
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,932
[IN LOW VOICE] Values, watchwords, tender years.

477
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:10,769
[IN NORMAL VOICE] A town you've probably never heard of.

478
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,439
Muncie, Indiana.

479
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:18,861
- You're from Muncie? - Why, yes. Do you know it?

480
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:24,283
Uh... Uhn!

481
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,796
[SINGING] Fight on

482
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:41,300
Fight on Dear old Muncie

483
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,801
Fight on

484
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,471
Hoist the gold and blue

485
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,475
You'll be tattered Torn and hurting

486
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:54,313
Once the Muncie's done with

487
00:37:54,522 --> 00:38:00,903
You

488
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:06,575
- Go, Eagles! - Go, Eagles!

489
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:11,789
A Muncie girl!

490
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,749
- What do you know about that? - Hmm.

491
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:15,918
I'll tell you what, Amy.

492
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,212
I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments...

493
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,964
...and get you a job here at Hud.

494
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:21,840
Oh, no! Really...

495
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:25,386
Don't bother to thank me. It's easy. I know where a vacancy just came up.

496
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:27,846
- Mailroom. This will only take a moment. MAN [OVER INTERCOM]: Yeah.

497
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,848
Good afternoon, this is Norville Barnes.

498
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,684
MUSSBURGER [OVER INTERCOM]: Barnes! Where the hell have you been?

499
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,979
- Where's my voucher? - Um...

500
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:36,855
- I'm not sure. - I need that voucher!

501
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:39,191
I told you a week ago it was important!

502
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,069
Ahem, I'm president of the company now.

503
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:45,656
I don't care if you're president of the company!

504
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,866
I need the voucher now!

505
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,537
Look, why don't you work in here with me?

506
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,914
Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?

507
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:59,003
Well, of course. I went to the Muncie Secretarial, uh, Polytechnic.

508
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,046
A Muncie girl! Can you beat that?

509
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,550
I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes.

510
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,552
Please, Norville.

511
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:10,639
NORVILLE: Go, Eagles! Heh. AMY: Go, Eagles!

512
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,937
"Once the Munce..." Holy moly!

513
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:20,399
Is this guy from Chumpsville? I even pulled the old mother routine.

514
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,775
- Adenoids? - Lumbago.

515
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:24,111
Phew. That gag's got whiskers on it.

516
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:25,404
AMY: I tell you, the Hudsucker board's up to something.

517
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,783
What's a six-letter word for an affliction of the hypothalamus?

518
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,453
And it's a cinch... Goiter. - This guy isn't in on it.

519
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:35,289
SMITTY: She's right here. - How much time to make the late final?

520
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,791
- Chief. - Tsk. Hiya, chief.

521
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:39,877
Just the person I wanted to apologize to.

522
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:43,756
- About seven minutes. - Yeah, I was all wet about your Idea Man.

523
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:48,719
Well, thanks for being so generous. It is human and you are divine.

524
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,263
No, he's no faker.

525
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:54,767
He's 100 percent real McCoy, beware of imitations, genuine article.

526
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:58,354
The guy's a real moron, as in a five-letter word for imbecile.

527
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:01,690
Oh, as pure a specimen as I've ever run across. Okay.

528
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,276
If working at the Argus doesn't make me an expert...

529
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:07,988
...then my name isn't Amy Archer and I never won the Pulitzer Prize.

530
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:09,823
In 1957.

531
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:13,285
My, oh, my series on the reunited triplets.

532
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:16,747
Well, come down here, hammerhead, and I'll show it to you!

533
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,291
What's a three-letter word for a flightless bird?

534
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:20,501
AMY: Not now, I'm busy.

535
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,670
Right, I said, "hammerhead," as in a 10-letter word for a smug...

536
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,047
...bullying newspaper man.

537
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,049
Gnu. Who couldn't find... That's G-N-U.

538
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,594
Couldn't find the Empire State Building with a compass, map and a guide.

539
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:33,764
Or is it Emu? That's just potatoes. Here comes the gravy.

540
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,265
The chump really likes me.

541
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:38,352
- Ah. A Muncie girl! - Better off falling for a rattlesnake.

542
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,105
This guy's just a patsy and I'm gonna find out what for.

543
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,315
There's a real story here, some kind of plot.

544
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:45,484
A set-up. Oh, and say, did I tell you?

545
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,403
- He didn't odder you money? - A sawbuck!

546
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,571
Ten smackers! Let's grab a highball!

547
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,448
- On Norville Barnes. - Yeah.

548
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,410
Copy!

549
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,149
Ms. Smith, would you come in and take a letter?

550
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:28,569
Of all the cockamamy...

551
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:33,198
Did you see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?

552
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:37,578
Well, I, uh, didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.

553
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:39,746
Well, the picture's fine.

554
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:42,249
It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath.

555
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:44,918
Of all the irresponsible... Take this down.

556
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:47,212
Dear, Ms. Archer.

557
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:50,966
I call you "Miss" because you seem to have missed the boat completely.

558
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,135
How would you know if I'm an imbecile?

559
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,929
You didn't have the guts to come interview me man-to-man!

560
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,848
Change "man-to-man" to "face-to-face."

561
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:01,226
Change "face-to-face" to "eye-to-eye" and "guts" to "common decency."

562
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,562
These wild speculations about my intelligence...

563
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,064
...these preposterous inventions would be suited...

564
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:09,026
...to the pages of Amazing Tales Magazine.

565
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,487
If the editors of the Manhattan Argus see fit...

566
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,906
...to publish the rantings of a disordered mind...

567
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,492
...perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter.

568
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,118
But I most seriously doubt it.

569
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:21,288
As I doubt also that you could find a home at Amazing Tales...

570
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:24,082
...a periodical which I have enjoyed for many years.

571
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:27,127
Sincerely, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

572
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,761
Is that all, Mr. Barnes?

573
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,304
Uh...

574
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:41,391
You know me, Amy, better than this dame. Do you think I'm an imbecile?

575
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,435
Oh, well, I'm sure I...

576
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:46,855
Tell the truth. I trust you. I place a lot of stock in your opinion.

577
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,859
- Well... - Oh, sure, heh, you're biased.

578
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,110
You're a fellow Muncian, heh.

579
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,320
Hmm.

580
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:58,283
But let me ask you a question: Would an imbecile come up with this?

581
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,999
I designed it myself.

582
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:10,337
This sweet baby will put Hudsucker right back on top.

583
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:11,880
Uh-huh.

584
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,299
You know, for kids.

585
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,596
Why don't I just type this up?

586
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:22,641
Oh, no, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it.

587
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,143
She's just doing her job, I guess.

588
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:27,854
I don't know, maybe she does deserve it.

589
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:31,108
Maybe she should have come in here and faced you man-to-man.

590
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,317
NORVILLE: She had a deadline.

591
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:36,530
Sure, but she still could've gotten your side, for the record.

592
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,533
Well, it's done now. What's the use of grousing about it? Ha, ha.

593
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,953
Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some steam. Heh.

594
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,872
She's probably just a little confused.

595
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:49,835
- Confused? - She's probably a fast-talking career gal...

596
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,754
...thinks she's one of the boys. If you know what I mean, heh.

597
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:55,507
Oh, I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.

598
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:58,176
Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays.

599
00:43:58,386 --> 00:43:59,678
Seems pretty obvious.

600
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,472
She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.

601
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:04,349
- Oh, is that it? - Yeah.

602
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,435
She probably dresses in men's clothing...

603
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,729
...drinks with the guys at the watering hole...

604
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:11,398
...hobnobs with some smooth-talking heel named Bidd...

605
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:13,358
...or Smoocher or, uh... - Smitty.

606
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:15,902
Exactly. I bet she's ugly, real ugly.

607
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:18,614
Otherwise, why isn't her picture next to her byline?

608
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:22,117
Oh, maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.

609
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,411
I bet that's exactly what she tells herself.

610
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:27,164
But you and I both know she's a dried-up, bitter old maid.

611
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,751
Amy, how about we grab a little dinner and a show after work?

612
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,502
I was thinking maybe The King and I.

613
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:35,339
Uh, how about Oklahoma!?

614
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:38,050
Norville, you don't know a thing about that woman!

615
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:39,760
You don't know who she really is.

616
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:42,304
And only a numbskull thinks he knows things...

617
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,640
...about things he knows nothing, uh, about.

618
00:44:46,643 --> 00:44:48,894
NORVILLE: Say, what gives?

619
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:42,030
Uh-huh.

620
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,730
The inventory of the Jacksonville...

621
00:46:56,939 --> 00:47:00,233
...facility should be reduced by 15 percent.

622
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:02,402
Memo from the desk of Sidney J. Mussburger...

623
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:05,155
MAN: What are you doing down there, Ms. Archer?

624
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,990
Huh?

625
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:17,292
Who are you? How did you know who I am?

626
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:23,215
I suspect Old Moses knows just about everything...

627
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:26,218
...leastways if it concerns Hudsucker.

628
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:28,553
But who are you? What do you do here?

629
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:33,892
I keep the old circle turning. This old clock needs plenty of care.

630
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,353
Time is money, Ms. Archer.

631
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:39,189
And money drives that old global economy...

632
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,733
...and keeps Big Daddy Earth spinning around.

633
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:45,111
- See, without that capital formation... - Yeah, yeah.

634
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:48,740
Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?

635
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:53,954
I don't tell no one nothing unless they ask.

636
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:56,581
That just ain't Old Moses' way.

637
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,750
So if you know everything about Hudsucker...

638
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,087
...tell me why the board decided to make Norville Barnes president?

639
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:05,549
Well, that even surprised Old Moses at first.

640
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:08,802
- I didn't think the board was that smart. - "That smart"?

641
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,929
But then I figured it out.

642
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,182
They did it because they figured young Norville for an imbecile...

643
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:15,934
...like some other people I know.

644
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:19,688
Now, why on earth would the board want a nitwit to be president?

645
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:24,109
Because they're little piglets. They're trying to inspire panic...

646
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:27,696
...make that stock cheap so they can snatch it all up for themselves.

647
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:32,075
But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve. He does.

648
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:34,160
You know, for kids.

649
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:35,453
- Hee-hee. - Uh-huh.

650
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:38,999
Yeah, he's a smart one, that Norville.

651
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:42,627
But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does...

652
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:43,795
...do you, Ms. Archer?

653
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:47,632
- Well, maybe I... - And only some kind of knuckle-head...

654
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:50,635
...thinks she knows things about things she, uh...

655
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:54,389
When she don't, uh...

656
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:57,934
- How'd that go? - Well, it's hardly the same.

657
00:48:58,144 --> 00:49:00,604
Why, you don't even know your own self.

658
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:04,482
You ain't exactly the genuine article, are you, Ms. Archer?

659
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:06,818
Yes, well, in connection with my job...

660
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:09,529
...sometimes I have to, uh, go undercover, as it were.

661
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:11,489
I don't mean that.

662
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:15,660
Why are you pretending to be such a hard old sourpuss?

663
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,163
Ain't gonna never make you happy.

664
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,500
I'm happy enough.

665
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,169
[LAUGHING]

666
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:26,171
Okay, Ms. Archer.

667
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:29,299
I got gears to see to.

668
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:36,806
I'm plenty happy!

669
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,689
AMY: Hello?

670
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:48,944
- I can't print that! - Why not? It's all true.

671
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:51,863
The board's using him to depress the stock to buy it cheap.

672
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:53,990
It's pure speculation! They'd have my butt in a satchel!

673
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,577
- Ah. Old satchel butt. AMY: I know they're gonna buy that stock.

674
00:49:57,787 --> 00:49:59,245
You don't. They haven't bought it.

675
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:01,623
The stock's cheap! What are they waiting for?

676
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,292
- I don't know. - Amy's hunches are usually pretty good.

677
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:07,170
You don't accuse somebody of stock manipulation on a hunch.

678
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,673
The readers aren't interested in sensationalism...

679
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:12,717
...gossip, unsupported speculation! Facts! Figures! Charts!

680
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:14,886
Those are the tools of the newspaper trade.

681
00:50:15,096 --> 00:50:18,181
It's as if you're trying to take the heat off this Barnes numbskull.

682
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:20,517
Oh, come on, chief. That's a low blow.

683
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:23,353
Archer's not going to go gooey for a corn-fed idiot.

684
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:26,856
I was out of line. But you're out of line with this stock-swindle story.

685
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:29,275
Give me more of that "moron from Sheboygan" studd.

686
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:30,860
- Muncie. - Whatever.

687
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,404
That's what sells newspapers!

688
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:35,156
I've got a harder story, "The Sap From The City Desk!"

689
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,826
- Watch it! - It's about a dim-witted editor who...

690
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,036
Easy, tough guy. Heh-heh-heh.

691
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,624
Does this suit look mannish to you?

692
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:47,127
SMITTY: Yeah, sure. Let's grab a highball.

693
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:49,170
AMY: Back off!

694
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,089
Smoocher!

695
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:55,343
Eh. What gives?

696
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:13,903
A man of great managerial potency.

697
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:16,448
My husband is also a president.

698
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:19,951
Sears Braithwaite of Bullard. Do you know him?

699
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:22,495
Your companion is an ode!

700
00:51:22,705 --> 00:51:25,123
A lyric! Are you betrothed?

701
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,709
Amy works in my office. She runs, uh...

702
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:32,255
- Oh, the folly of youth. - Those green remembered hills.

703
00:51:32,465 --> 00:51:35,884
That bourn from which no traveler returns.

704
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,219
I once ran the mimeograph for Sidney.

705
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:41,723
Though engaged at the time to quelqu'un d'autre...

706
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:45,643
...my water-cooler romance became a mad passion.

707
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:48,855
Uh. An amour fou.
A folie à deux.

708
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:53,651
I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man...

709
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:55,361
...Pierre of 5th Avenue. - Oh!

710
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:57,155
- Do you know him? - Do you know him?

711
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:02,327
Sidney and I are planning a trip to Paris and points continental.

712
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:06,498
- Oh. - Aren't we, dear?

713
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:12,670
For sure. I would like to borrow Norville for a while, if you don't mind, dear.

714
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,632
Oh, well, uh, frankly, I...

715
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,675
You have a very charming wife, Mr... Sid.

716
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:19,511
So they tell me.

717
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,223
Norville, let me shepherd you through some of the introductions here.

718
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:25,517
Try not to talk too much.

719
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:28,186
Some of our biggest stockholders are...

720
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,146
Scratch that. Say whatever you like.

721
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:32,649
Shake hands here with Sears Braithwaite of Bullard.

722
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:35,151
- Sir. - Glad to know you, Barnes.

723
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:37,028
MUSSBURGER: And this is Zebulon Cardozo...

724
00:52:37,238 --> 00:52:40,240
...one of Hudsucker's largest and most loyal stockholders.

725
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:42,534
What's this I hear about you being an imbecile?

726
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:44,536
What's ailing you, boy?

727
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:47,747
Last week, my stock was worth twice what it is now.

728
00:52:47,957 --> 00:52:50,667
I'm getting out of the whole kit and caboodle of it, boy...

729
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,253
...unless I see a vast improvement.

730
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:56,214
What you've got here, son, is a range war!

731
00:52:56,423 --> 00:53:00,176
You're gonna have to circle our wagons or I'm gonna get out of your wagon train.

732
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:02,887
No need for concern, sir.

733
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:05,181
It's only natural in a period of transition...

734
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:07,183
...for the more timid elements to run.

735
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:10,186
Yellow? I'll show you yellow, boy!

736
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:13,898
Zebulon, you mind now and quit acting like such an old grizzly.

737
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:16,568
MUSSBURGER: Step lively here, Norville.

738
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:19,737
I'm sorry, Sid, uh, I thought maybe if I showed him the long view...

739
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:22,824
And this is Thorstenson Finlandson...

740
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,952
...who heads a radical splinter group of disgruntled investors.

741
00:53:26,162 --> 00:53:27,829
Ah. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Finlandson.

742
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,707
It might interest you to know I studied Finnish in high school.

743
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,876
Let see, I hope I'm not too rusty. Um...

744
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:41,926
Ladies and gentlemen...

745
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:44,345
...distinguished members of the Hudsucker board...

746
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:48,600
...I give you the Rajah of Romance, the Ministereo of Moonlight...

747
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:51,102
...the incredible, the unforgettable...

748
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:55,190
...Mr. Vic Tenetta!

749
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:04,115
Rajah, I like that.

750
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:09,078
[SINGING] Take one fresh and tender kiss

751
00:54:11,332 --> 00:54:17,295
Add one stolen night of bliss

752
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:25,511
One girl one boy Some grief some joy

753
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:31,017
Memories are made of this

754
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,479
Don't

755
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,486
Norville?

756
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:47,242
What happened?

757
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:53,289
Oh, nothing. Just the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.

758
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:56,251
- Let me look. - Sid found me the ice pack.

759
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,962
Well, let me hold it or you'll have a real shiner.

760
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:00,380
Oh, thanks.

761
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:03,675
I guess people are pretty hot over this imbecile story.

762
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:05,468
I'm sorry.

763
00:55:05,678 --> 00:55:06,970
Oh, it's not your fault, Amy.

764
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:09,597
You're the one person standing by me through this.

765
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:13,434
Norville, there's something I have to tell you.

766
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:17,772
You see, I'm not really a secretary.

767
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,733
- I know that, Amy. - You do?

768
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:24,028
I understand you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts...

769
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:27,198
...but I'll tell you a secret, I'm not that skilled as president.

770
00:55:27,408 --> 00:55:31,619
- I know I put up a big front, but, uh... - I believe in you, Norville.

771
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:36,541
At least, I believe in your intentions.

772
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:40,586
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I suppose I have made a mess of things.

773
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:42,880
Those folks have to protect their investment.

774
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:44,716
Most of them are very nice people.

775
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:48,177
Listen, Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie.

776
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:50,221
Certain people are...

It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.

...picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats.

818
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:21,038
Or perhaps we simply touched horns briefly and went our separate ways.

Oh, I wish it were that simple, Norville.

I guess so, I don't think they promoted me because they thought I was a schmo.

A larger model Hula-Hoop for the portly, a battery option for the lazy or spastic.

01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:00,336
I'm sorry, buddy.

1089
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:02,922
- An example must be made. - What do you mean, buddy?

1090
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,342
You're fired.

1091
01:20:06,552 --> 01:20:08,636
Is that plain enough for you, buster?

1092
01:20:13,893 --> 01:20:15,435
Oh, buddy!

1093
01:20:16,187 --> 01:20:18,188
And don't call me "buddy."

1094
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:22,859
Oh, please, sir! This job running the elevator, it's all I got!

1095
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:24,778
Uh, it's okay if you don't like it.

1096
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:28,364
Just let me keep my job, I'm praying to you.

1097
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:32,911
Get out of my office! Get up! Up!

1098
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,914
We don't crawl here at Hudsucker Industries!

1099
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:40,877
BUZZ: I'm sorry, sir! I'm sorry!

1100
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:56,935
MUSSBURGER: Thank you, Aloysius.

1101
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:03,191
This is...

1102
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:05,735
...useful.

1103
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:28,007
Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale's really murder.

1104
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:31,928
MUSSBURGER: It's a tough course. A real lollapalooza.

1105
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:34,222
Sit down, son.

1106
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:42,605
I thought the boardroom would be a swell place to chat undisturbed.

1107
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:47,151
Seems we've got some security problems here at the Hud.

1108
01:21:47,361 --> 01:21:48,778
You don't say.

1109
01:21:48,988 --> 01:21:51,239
MUSSBURGER: Ordinarily, I wouldn't bother you with it...

1110
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:53,616
...but this is embarrassing.

1111
01:21:54,285 --> 01:21:56,411
It concerns you directly.

1112
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:59,247
- How's that, Sid? - It's not serious in itself.

1113
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:03,084
Some elevator boy that you'd fired came to me...

1114
01:22:03,294 --> 01:22:07,255
...claiming that you'd stolen the idea for, um, the dingus.

1115
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:09,424
You'd stolen it from him.

1116
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:14,721
- Maybe I was a little rough on him... - Forget it.

1117
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:18,224
You don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing.

1118
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:19,809
Fire whoever you want.

1119
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:25,982
No, the problem is who you hired.

1120
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:30,028
That dame. A spy, as it turns out.

1121
01:22:30,237 --> 01:22:33,698
She must have gotten to that elevator schnook...

1122
01:22:33,908 --> 01:22:37,035
...and her paper is going to town.

1123
01:22:37,244 --> 01:22:42,665
Sure, sure, we tried to kill the story, but the Argus won't play ball.

1124
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:46,002
The problem the board will have is you hired this woman...

1125
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:48,838
...and you kept her on...

1126
01:22:49,048 --> 01:22:51,841
...while she was making a chump out of you.

1127
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:54,594
Serious error in judgment.

1128
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:57,597
Business is war, kid.

1129
01:22:57,806 --> 01:23:00,850
Take no prisoners, give no second chances.

1130
01:23:04,313 --> 01:23:06,856
When the board meets after New Year's...

1131
01:23:07,066 --> 01:23:08,983
...your position...

1132
01:23:11,362 --> 01:23:13,196
Looks like you're finished.

1133
01:23:13,697 --> 01:23:15,281
Washed up.

1134
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:22,789
Oh, fourteenth hole at Riverdale...

1135
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:26,960
...some use a mashie, some use a niblick.

1136
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:28,753
Niblick.

1137
01:23:28,963 --> 01:23:31,214
You get more loft, more backspin.

1138
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:37,971
That dame...

1139
01:23:38,806 --> 01:23:41,891
...she got your throat pretty well slit.

1140
01:23:42,101 --> 01:23:44,060
When you're dead, you stay dead.

1141
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:48,189
You don't believe me, ask Waring Hudsucker.

1142
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:54,237
Tough luck, kid. You had a short climb up.

1143
01:23:54,655 --> 01:23:56,781
It's a long way down.

1144
01:24:07,418 --> 01:24:09,419
AMY: Stolen hoop idea from... You can't print that!

1145
01:24:09,628 --> 01:24:10,628
AL: We are printing it!

1146
01:24:10,838 --> 01:24:12,964
She hits the streets this evening.

1147
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:15,049
And she's dynamite!

1148
01:24:15,259 --> 01:24:16,426
But, Al, it's the bunk!

1149
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:19,178
Norville showed me his design the, uh, day I met him.

1150
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:22,223
Buzz couldn't have invented it. Look at him, he's an imbecile.

1151
01:24:22,433 --> 01:24:24,851
Aren't you a broken record? Gunderson did design it.

1152
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,436
Apparently, he's a prodigy.

1153
01:24:26,645 --> 01:24:28,855
- Says who? - You're not the only one with sources.

1154
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:31,566
Smith has a source on the Hud board. Very hush-hush.

1155
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:34,110
Yeah. I bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger.

1156
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:37,196
You lost it, Amy. You gone soft, by the looks of it.

1157
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:39,073
Soft on the dummy from Dubuque.

1158
01:24:40,117 --> 01:24:41,367
- Muncie. AL: Whatever!

1159
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:45,371
This story's hot and you're no longer on top of it. It's the scoop of the century!

1160
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:47,665
The other papers won't have this till tomorrow!

1161
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:51,627
They'll be choking on our dust come morning.

1162
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:55,298
You're fools, both of you! You're being used, don't you see, ugh?

1163
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:58,676
Take a break. You worked hard on this story. You broke it for us.

1164
01:24:58,886 --> 01:25:01,929
But it's passed you by and Smith's taking up the slack.

1165
01:25:02,973 --> 01:25:06,309
Tsk, oh, you want slack, I'll give you slack!

1166
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:10,313
You're not putting me out to pasture! I quit! Consider this my resignation!

1167
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:14,317
Effective immediately!

1168
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:18,404
Soft.

1169
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:28,790
BRONFENBRENNER [OVER SPEAKER]: So tell me...

1170
01:25:28,999 --> 01:25:31,751
...why do you feel this woman betrayed you?

1171
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:35,338
Tsk, oh, what's the difference?

1172
01:25:35,547 --> 01:25:38,299
The whole world, it seems, is against you?

1173
01:25:38,509 --> 01:25:39,634
I don't know.

1174
01:25:39,843 --> 01:25:41,677
Und the elevator boy...

1175
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:45,056
...Buzz, he too works against you?

1176
01:25:45,265 --> 01:25:46,974
NORVILLE: Well, yeah.

1177
01:25:47,184 --> 01:25:48,351
Classic.

1178
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,771
Patient displayed listlessness, apathy, gloomy indidderence...

1179
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:54,023
...und was blue und mopey.

1180
01:25:54,233 --> 01:25:57,443
When asked what the Rorschach stains represented, patient replied:

1181
01:25:57,945 --> 01:26:02,657
"Nothing much. I don't know. Just a blotch. Sure beats me."

1182
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:06,452
Patient shows no ambition, no get-up-and-go, no vim.

1183
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:09,163
He is riding the grand loopen-ze-loop...

1184
01:26:09,373 --> 01:26:12,208
...that goes from the height of delusional gaiety...

1185
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:14,502
...to the trough of despair.

1186
01:26:14,711 --> 01:26:17,880
He is now near, but not yet at his lowest point.

1187
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:23,970
When he reaches bottom, he may erupt und pose a danger to himself und others.

1188
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:26,055
MUSSBURGER: Diagnosis, Dr. Bronfenbrenner?

1189
01:26:26,265 --> 01:26:29,225
Patient is eine manic-depressive paranoid, type B...

1190
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:31,310
...with acute schizoid tendencies.

1191
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:34,522
So patient is?

1192
01:26:35,274 --> 01:26:37,692
Precisely, nuts!

1193
01:26:38,277 --> 01:26:39,318
Prescription?

1194
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:44,490
Three things, commitment, electroconvulsive therapy...

1195
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:48,161
...maintenance in eine secure facility.

1196
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:05,761
MAN: Yeah, he's a tall guy. A real mess.

1197
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:10,349
Yeah, yeah, look, you better get down here. He says he's a friend of yours.

1198
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:14,270
He didn't say. But, man, is he from Squaresville.

1199
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:23,613
NORVILLE: I want a martini!

1200
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:26,616
It's New Year's Eve. I deserve a martini.

1201
01:27:26,825 --> 01:27:31,120
- Daddy, it's like I've been telling you. You... - I thought you served misfits here.

1202
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:34,123
Yeah, daddy. That's a roger. But we don't sell alcohol.

1203
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:36,792
What kind of bar is it, you can't get a martini?

1204
01:27:37,002 --> 01:27:40,463
It's a juice-and-coddee bar, man, like I've been telling you.

1205
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:45,718
- Right. So I want a martini. - Argh.

1206
01:27:45,928 --> 01:27:49,305
I've had a martini in every bar all the way down here, heh.

1207
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:51,974
Martinis are for squares, man.

1208
01:27:53,435 --> 01:27:56,395
What'd you call me, you beatnik son of a...?

1209
01:27:56,605 --> 01:27:57,605
AMY: Norville.

1210
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:00,775
What?

1211
01:28:00,984 --> 01:28:05,404
- Oh-ho, look who's here, Amy Archer... - Oh, no.

1212
01:28:05,614 --> 01:28:07,782
...Prizeter Pule winner.

1213
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:10,076
Looking for a nitwit to buy you lunch?

1214
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:13,955
- Norville, I'm sorry. - Bar fella, I'd like...

1215
01:28:14,164 --> 01:28:15,164
...a martini, please.

1216
01:28:15,374 --> 01:28:19,001
I tried to tell you so many times, I...

1217
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:23,214
It's hard to admit when you've been wrong.

1218
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:25,049
If you could just...

1219
01:28:25,259 --> 01:28:29,887
...find it in your heart to give me another chance.

1220
01:28:30,973 --> 01:28:31,973
Ha.

1221
01:28:32,182 --> 01:28:34,433
"You take no prisoners, give no second chances."

1222
01:28:34,643 --> 01:28:38,020
Please, Norville! Please give me one more chance!

1223
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:41,649
And yourself too. We both deserve one.

1224
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:43,192
Just give us a second chance.

1225
01:28:43,402 --> 01:28:45,361
Together we can fight this thing.

1226
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:47,989
I know this last story was a lie and we can prove it.

1227
01:28:48,198 --> 01:28:49,532
You got to release a statement.

1228
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:53,244
- I can help you write it. - Oh, what's the difference?

1229
01:28:53,453 --> 01:28:55,621
I'm all washed up.

1230
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:59,875
Extinct. Homo sapiens sapicus.

1231
01:29:01,253 --> 01:29:05,673
Well, heh, that just about does it.

1232
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:09,510
I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry...

1233
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:13,222
...and I've seen Norville Barnes, the self-important heel.

1234
01:29:13,432 --> 01:29:16,559
But I've never seen Norville Barnes, the quitter...

1235
01:29:17,269 --> 01:29:19,395
...and I don't like it.

1236
01:29:20,439 --> 01:29:22,398
Fight on.

1237
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:26,360
Fight on, dear old Muncie.

1238
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:31,532
Fight on. Hoist the gold and blue.

1239
01:29:31,742 --> 01:29:35,453
You'll be tattered, torn and hurting.

1240
01:29:35,662 --> 01:29:40,416
Once the Munce is done with you.

1241
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:44,837

...and to give you gentlemen of the board a firsthand look.

1390

MOSES: That's the story of how Norville Barnes climbed way up...

1391

...to the 44th floor of the Hudsucker building...

1392
01:45:46,257 --> 01:45:51,011
...and then fell all the way down, but didn't quite squish his self.

1393

You know, they say there was a man who jumped from the 45th floor.
