1
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:39,622
That's right.

2
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,916
New York.

3
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,919
It's 1958.

4
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:49,298
Anyway, for a few more minutes it is.

5
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:53,261
Come midnight, it's gonna be 1959.

6
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,473
A whole other feeling. The new year.

7
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,600
The future.

8
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:05,273
Yeah, Old Daddy Earth fixing to start one more trip around the sun.

9
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:09,318
Everybody hoping this ride round be a little more giddy...

10
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,571
a little more gay.

11
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,159
Yup, all over town, champagne corks is a-popping.

12
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:22,373
Over in the Waldorf, the big shots is dancing to the strains of Guy Lombardo.

13
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:28,546
In Times Square, the little folks is watching and waiting for that big ball to drop.

14
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:33,217
They're all trying to catch hold of one moment of time...

15
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:39,390
to be able to say, "Right now! This is it! I got it!"

16
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,644
Of course, by then it'll be past.

17
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:49,275
But they're all happy, everybody having a good time.

18
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:52,195
Well, almost everybody.

19
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:56,491
There's a few lost souls floating around out there.

20
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,536
Now, if you all ain't from the city...

21
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:04,248
we got something here called "the rat race."

22
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:08,753
Got a way of chewing folks up so that they don't want no celebrating...

23
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,130
don't want no cheering up.

24
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,008
Don't care nothing about no New Year's.

25
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:19,722
Out of hope, out of rope, out of time.

26
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,601
This here is Norville Barnes.

27
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,437
That office he's stepping out of...

28
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:30,316
is the oddice of the president of Hudsucker Industries.

29
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,443
That's his office.

30
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,822
How'd he get so high?

31
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:39,033
And why's he feeling so low?

32
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,203
Is he really going to do it?

33
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:46,582
Is Norville really gonna jelly up the sidewalk?

34
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:52,296
Well, the future, that's something you can never tell about.

35
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,467
But the past, heh-heh...

36
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,554
that's another story.

37
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,656
In the third quarter we saw no signs of weakening.

38
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,951
We're up 18 percent over last year's third-quarter gross...

39
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,578
and that, needless to say, is a new record.

40
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:34,375
Our competition continues to flag and we continue to take up the slack.

41
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,211
Market shares in most divisions is increasing...

42
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:40,715
and we have opened seven new regional offices.

43
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,300
Our international division...

44
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,637
is also showing vigorous signs of upward movement for the last six months...

45
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,141
and we're looking at some exciting things in R&D.

46
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:33,809
Sub-franchising. Don't talk to me about sub-franchising.

47
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,270
We're making so much money in sub-franchising...

48
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,147
it isn't even funny.

49
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:42,360
Our nominees and assigns continue to multiply and expand...

50
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:46,197
extending our influence nationally and abroad.

51
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,699
Our owned and operateds are performing...

52
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,161
far beyond our expectations both here and abroad.

53
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,914
And the Federal Tax Act of 1958...

54
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:59,794
is giving us a swell write-off on our plant and heavies.

55
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:28,364
And our last debenture issue was this year's fastest seller.

56
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,283
So third quarter and year-to-date...

57
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:35,287
we have set a new record in sales, a new record in gross...

58
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,165
a new record in pre-tax earnings...

59
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,460
a new record in after-tax profits...

60
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,547
and our stock has split twice in the past year.

61
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,132
In short...

62
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,513
we're loaded.

63
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,358
Mr. Hudsucker?

64
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:35,259
It's a pity to waste a whole Montecristo.

65
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,844
He could've opened the window.

66
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,763
Waring Hudsucker never did anything the easy way.

67
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:44,018
Why? Why did he do it? Everything was going so well.

68
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:47,104
What, am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.

69
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,148
He didn't look unhappy.

70
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:53,819
- He didn't look rich.  - He was never an easy man to figure out.

71
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,739
He built this company with his bare hands.

72
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:59,908
Every step he took was a step up...

73
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,994
except, of course, this last one.

74
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,330
Sure, sure he was a swell fella...

75
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,832
but when the president, chairman of the board...

76
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,336
and owner of 87 percent of the company stock drops...

77
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,796
- 44 floors...  - Forty-five.

78
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,214
Counting the mezzanine.

79
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,134
Then the company, too, has a problem. Stillson!

80
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,930
What exactly is the disposition of Waring's stock?

81
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,557
Well, as you know...

82
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,643
Hud left no will and no family.

83
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,729
The company bylaws are quite clear in that event.

84
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,358
"His entire portfolio will be converted into common stock...

85
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:36,904
and will be sold over the counter as of the first of the fiscal year...

86
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,406
- following his demise."  - Meaning?

87
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:43,118
Meaning simply that Waring's stock and control of the company...

88
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:46,789
will be made available to the public January 1st.

89
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,667
Do you mean to say...

90
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:53,504
that any slob in a smelly T-shirt will be able to buy Hudsucker stock?

91
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,714
The company bylaws are quite clear.

92
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,841
My God! You're animals!

93
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:02,262
How can you discuss his stock when the man has just leapt 45 floors?

94
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,015
- Forty four.  - Not counting the mezzanine.

95
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,267
Quit showboating, Addison. The man is gone.

96
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,646
The question now is whether we'll let John Q. Public waltz in here...

97
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,816
and buy our company.  - What are you suggesting, Sydney?

98
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,111
Certainly we can't afford to buy a controlling interest.

99
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,613
Not while the stock is this strong.

100
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,908
How soon before Hud's paper hits the market?

101
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,284
- January 1st.  - Thirty days.

102
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,161
- Four weeks.  - A month at the most.

103
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:29,498
One month to make the blue-chip investment of the century...

104
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,084
look like a round-trip ticket on the Titanic.

105
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,545
We play up the fact that Hud is dead.

106
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,422
Long live the Hud!

107
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,591
- We depress the stock.  - To the point where we can buy 50 percent.

108
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,802
- Fifty one.  - Not counting the mezzanine.

109
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,387
- It could work.  - It should work.

110
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,223
- It would work.  - It's working already.

111
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:51,270
Waring Hudsucker is abstract art on Madison Avenue.

112
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:55,983
What we need now is a new president who will inspire panic in the stockholder.

113
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,484
- A puppet.  - A proxy.

114
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,111
A pawn.

115
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,573
Sure, sure, some jerk...

116
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,159
we can really push around.

117
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,038
You punch in at 8:30 every morning,

118
00:13:08,338 --> 00:13:10,038
at 7:30 following a business holiday...

119
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,499
unless it's a Monday, then you punch in 8:00.

120
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,919
- Punch in late and they dock you.  - This goes to seven! Urgent.

121
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,715
Incoming articles get a voucher. Outgoing articles provide a voucher.

122
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,342
Move any article without a voucher and they dock you!

123
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,970
Take this up to the secretarial pool on three! ASAP!

124
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,890
Letter-size, a green voucher! Folder-size, a yellow voucher!

125
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:31,310
- Parcel-size, a maroon voucher!  - This is for Morgatross! Chop-chop!

126
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,521
Wrong color voucher and they dock you!

127
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,107
6-7-8-7-0-4-9-Alpha-6!

128
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,486
That is your employee number! It will not be repeated!

129
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:43,322
Without your employee number you cannot get your paycheck.

130
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,865
All right, this goes up to 27!

131
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,868
Return a waiver! Do not return without a signed waiver!

132
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,689
Inter-office mail is code 37!

133
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:52,289
Intra-office mail is 37-3.

134
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,666
Outside mail is 3-37.

135
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,460
Code it wrong and they dock you!

136
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,630
I was supposed to have this on 2810 minutes ago!

137
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,256
This has been your orientation.

138
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:04,468
Is there anything you do not understand or understand partially?

139
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,347
If you have not been fully orientated, you must file a complaint with Personnel!

140
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,391
File a faulty complaint and they dock you!

141
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:20,734
Kloppitt. Kloppitt, Kloppitt...

142
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,319
Max Kloppitt.

143
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,655
"Max Kloppitt, Jr."

144
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,750
What do you do when the envelope is too big for the slot?

145
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,212
Well, if you fold them, they fire you.

146
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,675
I usually throw them out.

147
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,891
- Just got hired today.  - Mm-hm.

148
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,686
- Terrific.  - You know, entry level.

149
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,604
Tell me about it.

150
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,400
But I got big ideas.

151
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,694
I'm sure you do.

152
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,739
For instance, take a look at this sweet baby.

153
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,953
I developed it myself.

154
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,789
Yes, sirree, this is my ticket upstairs.

155
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,961
You know, for kids.

156
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,255
Terrific.

157
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,466
So you see, I won't be working in the mail room long.

158
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,761
No, I don't guess you will be.

159
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,931
- How long you been here?  - Forty-eight years.

160
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:37,811
Next year they move me up to parcels if I'm lucky.

161
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,105
Attention Hudsucker employees!

162
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:42,482
Attention Hudsucker employees!

163
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:46,403
We regretfully announce that at 30 seconds after the hour of noon...

164
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:47,696
Hudsucker time...

165
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:50,657
Waring Hudsucker, founder, president...

166
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,660
and chairman of the board of Hudsucker Industries...

167
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,203
merged with the infinite.

168
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:58,373
To mark this occasion of corporate loss...

169
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:03,128
we ask that all employees observe a moment of silent contemplation.

170
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,470
Thank you for your kind attention.

171
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,514
This moment has been duly noted on your timecards...

172
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:18,185
and will be deducted from your pay. That is all.

173
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,857
- Blue letter!  - Blue letter!

174
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,776
They're bringing down a blue letter!

175
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,478
It's a blue letter.

176
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,855
Top, top level.

177
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,733
Confidential communication between the brass.

178
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,569
Usually bad news.

179
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,905
They hate blue letters upstairs.

180
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:18,120
- Hate them.  - You!

181
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,456
Yeah, you! Barnes! You don't look busy!

182
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,334
Think you can handle a blue letter?

183
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,212
This letter was sent this morning by the big man himself...

184
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,006
that's right, Waring Hudsucker!

185
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,759
It's addressed to Sid Mussburger, Hudsucker's right-hand man!

186
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,511
It's a blue letter!

187
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,931
That means you got to put it right in Mussburger's hands.

188
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,350
No secretaries! No receptionists!

189
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,520
No colleagues! No excuses!

190
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,230
Mussburger!

191
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:51,111
Hi, my name's Buzz, I got the fuzz, I make the elevator do what she does.

192
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,322
Hang it up to dry. What's your pleasure, buddy?

193
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,242
- Forty-four.  - Forty-four, the top-brass floor.

194
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:00,203
Say, buddy, what takes 50 years to get to the top floor...

195
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,164
and 30 seconds to get down?

196
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,708
Waring Hudsucker! You get it, buddy?

197
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,420
Say, buddy! Mr. Kline, up to nine. Mrs. Dell, Personnel.

198
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,297
- Mr. Levin, 37.  - Thirty-six.

199
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,175
Walk down! Ladies and gentlemen, please step to the rear.

200
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:16,636
- Here comes the gargantuan Mr. Grier.  - Buzz.

201
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:20,766
Say, buddy, who's the most liquid businessman on the street?

202
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,226
Waring Hudsucker. Say, buddy.

203
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:27,481
When is the sidewalk fully dressed? When it's wearing Hudsucker! Ha-ha-ha.

204
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,692
You get it, buddy? It's a pun, it's a knee-slapper...

205
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:32,854
it's a play on... Jesus, Joseph and Mary,

206
00:18:33,054 --> 00:18:34,154
is that a blue letter?

207
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:39,451
Why didn't you tell a guy? Hold on, folks, we're express to the top floor!

208
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,759
Good luck, buddy.

209
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,680
You're gonna need it. Ha-ha-ha.

210
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,486
Mr. Mussburger's office?

211
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,753
Hello.

212
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:17,716
- Do you have an appointment?  - No.

213
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:22,012
- Shall we look in the book? Hmm?  - Ma'am, we shall...

214
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,265
- We don't seem to be in the book.  - I wouldn't be.

215
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:29,436
If we had an appointment, we'd be in the book.

216
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,188
I have this, uh...

217
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,522
Oh, here it is. Heh.

218
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,905
Gambotz?

219
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,448
Harry Gambotz?

220
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,035
No, too risky. He's green but he's not slow.

221
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:46,953
Who is he?

222
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,998
No, I want an imbecile, not a cipher or you'd have the job.

223
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,461
They moved him to grommets and O-rings.

224
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,129
He's doing pretty well.

225
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,633
No, no, not, McClanahan.

226
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:02,886
He bungled the Teleyard merger, thinks he's got something to prove.

227
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,846
Who let you in?

228
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:08,642
Atwater? Tremendous. Except I just fired him last week.

229
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,227
Mr. Mussburger...

230
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,895
Mr. Bumstead's waiting downstairs.

231
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,189
- I'll be right there.  - Yes, Mr. Mussburger.

232
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,482
Spit it out!

233
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,567
- I, uh...  - Yeah?

234
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,195
Well, maybe you're the company's biggest moron.

235
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,532
We can't use Morris. Been here too long.

236
00:21:21,832 --> 00:21:24,032
He's a nice guy with too many friends.

237
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:27,494
In fact, why don't you fire him? Scratch that, I'll fire him.

238
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,454
Make it fast, huh, fast!

239
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:31,539
Mr. Bumstead is growing restless.

240
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,917
Tell him I'll be right there. Give him a magazine.

241
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,543
What, are you a mute?

242
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,547
How's the stock doing? Bad?

243
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,676
Well, it's not bad enough. Listen, chump.

244
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:46,930
Either you find me a ding-dong or tender your key to the executive washroom.

245
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,684
That goes double for you, pal. Ear-clay? Ood-gay!

246
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,524
This better be good. I'm in a bad mood.

247
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:01,778
Sir, I've got something for you from the mail room, but first...

248
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:06,950
if I could take a minute of your very valuable time to show you something...

249
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,328
I've been working on for the past two or three years.

250
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:18,712
You know, for kids.

251
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:21,232
It's perfect for Hudsucker,

252
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:22,632
not that I'm any great genius.

253
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,051
They say inspiration is 99 percent perspiration...

254
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,137
in my case it's at least twice that...

255
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,056
- but I've got to tell you, this sweet...  - Wait a minute!

256
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,353
Sit down, son.

257
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,106
Go ahead.

258
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,234
Try it on.

259
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:37,290
Put your feet up.

260
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,545
Go ahead.

261
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:48,134
Let's get to know one another, shall we?

262
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,637
Let's chat.

263
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,599
Man-to-man.

264
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:04,234
Now then, you're from the basement, aren't you?

265
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,363
And weren't blessed with much...

266
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:10,990
education?

267
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,993
Well, I am a college graduate.

268
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,621
But you did not excel in your studies.

269
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:19,499
- Well, I... I made Dean's List.  - Oh.

270
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,918
At the Muncie College of Business Administration.

271
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,798
And your friends, they called you "jerk," didn't they?

272
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,049
Mm, unh-uhn.

273
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:30,135
- "Dope?" "Dipstick?"  - Mm-mm. No.

274
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:32,846
"Lamebrain?" "Schmo?" Not even behind your back?

275
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,849
Well, as a matter they voted me "Most Likely to Succeed."

276
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,308
You're fired.

277
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:43,022
Get your feet off my desk, get out of my office.

278
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,150
Leave your apron in the locker room.

279
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,359
Oh, my God!

280
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:50,947
The Bumstead contract. I've been working on that deal for four years!

281
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,199
Get out of here! I'll take care of it! Get out.

282
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:57,120
You could have destroyed the most sensitive document of my career.

283
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,747
Mr. Bumstead is threatening to leave the building.

284
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:01,082
I'm on my way down.

285
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,877
We need the first page of the contract retyped.

286
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,713
Yes, Mr. Mussburger.

287
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:10,133
Yeah? Uh-huh. Yeah.

288
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,968
Out! Out of the office!

289
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,972
Down three points, huh?

290
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,516
That's encouraging. How about New York?

291
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:21,519
Not that way, through the door!

292
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:24,230
Sir, it'll take three hours to retype the Bumstead contract...

293
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:28,026
Where are you going? Get out of here! Stop that!

294
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,944
Mr. Bumstead's threatening to leave.

295
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:31,237
Not the whole contract, just the first page.

296
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:34,491
I'll be there. Give him another magazine.

297
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,701
- He says he'll leave.  - I said I'll be there!

298
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:38,912
And you're wife's been trying to reach you.

299
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:42,332
Up on your feet! We don't crawl here at Hudsucker Industries!

300
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,125
- My leg is on fire!  - No assumptions!

301
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:48,588
It's early yet. Just let me know where we stand at the closing bell.

302
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,766
Oh, my God, the Bumstead contract!

303
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,148
No magazines! No coffee!

304
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:12,278
Mussburger! I wanna see Mussburger! Or did he jump out a window too?

305
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:16,574
Don't worry, Mr. Mussburger, I got you! I got you by your pants.

306
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,329
Pants?

307
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,836
Mr. Mussburger, I'm gonna give your pants a nice double stitch.

308
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:33,925
It'll make them real strong and you're gonna look real sharp.

309
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:39,264
- No, single stitch is fine.  - But the double stitch, she lasts forever.

310
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:43,893
Why on earth would I want a double stitch?

311
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,812
To pad your account.

312
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,814
Single stitch is fine.

313
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,446
Damn!

314
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:05,206
Oh, what the heck! Mr. Mussburger is such a nice man...

315
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:08,543
I'm gonna give him a double stitch anyway. Heh-heh-heh.

316
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:12,797
Ah. That's some strong stitch, you bet!

317
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,739
"The Einstein of Enterprise."

318
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:04,325
"The Edison of Industry."

319
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:07,578
"The Billion-Dollar Cranium!"

320
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:11,165
"Idea Man!"

321
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,544
And not one of you has given me a story on him!

322
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,587
Bunch of lamebrains!

323
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:19,132
Facts, figures, charts. They never sold a newspaper!

324
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:21,926
I read this morning's Argus, let me tell you something.

325
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,804
I'd wrap a fish in it! I'd use it as kindling!

326
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,598
I'd train my poodle on it if he wasn't a French poodle...

327
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:29,517
and partial to pages of Paris-Soir.

328
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:32,645
But I wouldn't shell out a hard-earned nickel to read the thing!

329
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:34,772
Come on, chief, give us a break.

330
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:37,817
Sure, Tibbs. Take a break.

331
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,570
Go to Florida. Lie in the sun.

332
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,364
Wait for a coconut to drop. File a story on it.

333
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:46,784
It'd be more of a grabber than your piece on the county grain surplus!

334
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:49,662
The human angle! That's what sells papers!

335
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:53,166
We need a front page with a heart and the Idea Man can put it there!

336
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,001
Look, chief, if we had more access...

337
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,754
If a frog had wings it wouldn't bump it's ass a-hopping.

338
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,756
I don't want excuses, I want results!

339
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,508
What makes the Idea Man tick? Where's he from?

340
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:06,345
I want to know everything about him! Has he got a girl? Has he got parents?

341
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,598
Everybody has parents.

342
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,850
All right, how many?

343
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:14,520
How about it, Parkinson? You've been awful quiet over there.

344
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,856
- Uh...  - Still waters run deep.

345
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,692
Only thing deep with Parkinson are the holes in his ears.

346
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:21,736
Yes, Idea Man.

347
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:25,364
What are his hopes and dreams, his desires and aspirations?

348
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:28,201
Does he think all the time or a certain portion of the day?

349
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,578
How tall is he? Shoe size? Where does he sleep?

350
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:32,205
What does he have for breakfast?

351
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,290
Does he put jam on his toast or doesn't he?

352
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,542
If not, why not and since when?

353
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:38,711
Well?

354
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,714
Ah. You're useless.

355
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:44,717
Yes. Idea Man. "Creator."

356
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:47,970
"Innovator." "Cerebrator."

357
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,889
- Fake!  - Huh?

358
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,808
I tell you, the guy's a phony.

359
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,559
- Phony, huh?  - As a three-dollar bill.

360
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,186
- Says who?  - Says me, Amy Archer!

361
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,730
Why is he an Idea Man? Because Hudsucker says he is?

362
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,566
What are his ideas? Why can't anyone interview him?

363
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:03,402
Five bucks says she mentions her Pulitzer.

364
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,571
Again? You're on.

365
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:07,824
Just take a look at the mug on this guy.

366
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,785
The jutting eyebrows, the simian forehead, the idiotic grin.

367
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:15,289
He has a face only a mother could love on payday.

368
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:18,084
The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.

369
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,003
Yeah, monkey or not, I'm still editor of this rag.

370
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:24,215
You were doing the piece on the FBI. "Hoover: When Will He Marry?"

371
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,426
- I filed it yesterday. Nice tie, Earl.  - Well, do a follow-up.

372
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,554
"Hoover: Crime Buster or Pantywaist?"

373
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,266
The rest of you mugs get off your brains

374
00:31:31,466 --> 00:31:33,266
and get me that Idea Man story!

375
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:36,185
Al, he's the bunk.

376
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:44,443
- I'll stake my Pulitzer on it!  - Hmm.

377
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,281
Say, buddy, where'd you get the new duds?

378
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,784
Say, buddy, how did old bucket butt like his blue letter? Heh.

379
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:55,329
Did he bust a gut? Did he die? Well, hello, Mr. Mussburger.

380
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:58,249
- Lobby, we haven't got all day.  - Right away, Mr. Mussburger.

381
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,585
How are you this fine morning, sir?

382
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,713
It's been a pleasure serving you today, sir.

383
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,757
It's been a pleasure serving you too, uh, buddy.

384
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:09,010
Uh, Sid, shouldn't we be a little concerned...

385
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:11,971
with the downward spiral of our stock these past few days?

386
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,473
You're the expert, but at the Muncie College...

387
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,434
Relax, it's only natural...

388
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,979
in a period of transition for the more timid element to run for cover.

389
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,647
Like I said, you're the expert...

390
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:24,275
but do you remember the plan I outlined for you...

391
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,320
the day I set fire to your office? The day I was promoted?

392
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:32,783
I do remember and I was impressed. But that's all forgotten now.

393
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,369
Oh. Thank you, Sid.

394
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:39,332
The reason I mention it is it requires such a small capital investment...

395
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,000
Again, you are the expert here.

396
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,419
But there's such an enormous potential profit...

397
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:46,631
given the discretionary income of the burgeoning middle-class.

398
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,134
So if you agree, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch.

399
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:51,510
Sure, sure.

400
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,348
Tell whoever you want. I'd like to hear about it at some point too.

401
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:09,195
- I got gas, Benny.  - Yeah. Tell me about it.

402
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,365
No kidding, Benny. I got gas.

403
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:15,910
- You get the special?  - Far from it.

404
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,165
Enter the dame.

405
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:23,834
There's one in every story.

406
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:26,712
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.

407
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:30,257
Twenty bucks says not here, she don't find one.

408
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:33,219
- She's looking for her mark.  - She finds him.

409
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:38,557
She sits down and orders a light lunch.

410
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,811
How will she pay for this lunch?

411
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,439
- She looks through her purse.  - No money.

412
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:48,150
The mark notices.

413
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:52,071
- He's not noticing, Benny.  - Maybe he's wise.

414
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,699
He don't look wise.

415
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:57,326
Plan two.

416
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,453
Here come the waterworks.

417
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:01,706
- Yellowstone.  - Old Faithful.

418
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:03,874
Hello, Niagara.

419
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:06,836
- He notices.  - She's distressed.

420
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,838
He's concerned.

421
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,215
She explains her predicament.

422
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:16,012
And enter the light lunch.

423
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:20,599
- She's got other problems.  - There's illness in the family.

424
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:23,602
- Her mother needs an operation.  - Urgently.

425
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:26,564
- Adenoids.  - No, Benny.

426
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:29,150
Lumbago.

427
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,527
That gag's got whiskers on it.

428
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:34,405
Uh-oh. He ain't biting, Benny.

429
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,616
- She's losing him, Lou.  - Maybe he's wise.

430
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,952
He don't look wise.

431
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:42,788
- How does she pull this out?  - He's getting away.

432
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:46,417
- She better think fast.  - She isn't.

433
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,753
She is!

434
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,796
She's good, Benny.

435
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:53,132
She's damn good, Lou.

436
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:56,093
Can I get you boys anything else?

437
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,766
- Bromo.  - Bromo.

438
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:06,979
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible elevator boy.

439
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:10,107
I can't say how much I appreciate your listening to my story.

440
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:14,320
I'm lucky to find someone in this bustling city with a stout heart and a ready ear.

441
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,448
At any rate, there I was traveling this great country.

442
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:18,783
Some I met were kind to me, others exceedingly cruel.

443
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,453
Traveling by motor bus, rail, even by thumb.

444
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:23,954
The couch, please.

445
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:27,583
Hoarding every dollar, counting every nickel, pinching every penny.

446
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,503
It's been a long road leading to the coddee shop downstairs.

447
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:34,090
Not that I'd trade a day, an hour, a moment of it for anything.

448
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,716
I don't know what came over me.

449
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:37,843
It was the shock of eating after so long...

450
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:40,930
without the enzymes kicking in after so long...

451
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,187
Then you couldn't possibly know what it is to be tired and hungry.

452
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,314
- Hungry, anyway.  - I don't wanna bore you...

453
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:52,733
with all details of my life. Not a happy story.

454
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:55,236
I'm jobless but not for want of trying.

455
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:58,906
I'm friendless, with no one to take care of me and had you not come along...

456
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:01,325
- exactly when you did...  - I, myself...

457
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:03,786
At any rate, I arrived in town not 10 days ago...

458
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,331
full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world...

459
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:08,791
a little naive perhaps...

460
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,043
but armed with determination, work ethic...

461
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:12,711
and a belief in the future...

462
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,880
- I, myself...  - Only to have that belief...

463
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:18,342
that unsullied optimism, dashed against the marble of the workplace.

464
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:21,554
Such is life. Seek and you shall find. Work and you shall prosper.

465
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:23,222
- Cigarette?  - No, thank you.

466
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,808
Seek and you shall find, work and you shall prosper.

467
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,227
These were the watchwords of my education...

468
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,187
the values instilled in me...

469
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:33,524
while I was growing up in a little town you've never heard of.

470
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,234
- Mind if I join you?  - Be my guest.

471
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,528
A little town you've probably never heard of...

472
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,530
a dusty crossroads of which you've probably never heard.

473
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,119
Excuse me. Executive washroom.

474
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:49,415
Are you all right?

475
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,460
Is it your lunch? The chicken ид la king?

476
00:36:56,590 --> 00:37:01,630
- Is the ид la king repeating on you?  - No, I'm fine. You were saying?

477
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,471
Uh...

478
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,932
Values, watchwords, tender years.

479
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:10,769
A town you've probably never heard of.

480
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,439
Muncie, Indiana.

481
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:18,861
- You're from Muncie?  - Why, yes. Do you know it?

482
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:24,283
Uh... Uhn!

483
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,796
Fight on

484
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:41,300
Fight on Dear old Muncie

485
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,801
Fight on

486
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,471
Hoist the gold and blue

487
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,475
You'll be tattered Torn and hurting

488
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:54,313
Once the Muncie's done with

489
00:37:54,522 --> 00:38:00,903
You

490
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:06,575
- Go, Eagles!  - Go, Eagles!

491
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:11,789
A Muncie girl!

492
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,749
- What do you know about that?  - Hmm.

493
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:15,918
I'll tell you what, Amy.

494
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,212
I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments...

495
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,964
and get you a job here at Hud.

496
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:21,840
Oh, no! Really...

497
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:25,386
Don't bother to thank me. It's easy. I know where a vacancy just came up.

498
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:27,846
- Mailroom. This will only take a moment.  - Yeah.

499
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,848
Good afternoon, this is Norville Barnes.

500
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,684
Barnes! Where the hell have you been?

501
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,979
- Where's my voucher?  - Um...

502
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:36,855
- I'm not sure.  - I need that voucher!

503
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:39,191
I told you a week ago it was important!

504
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,069
Ahem, I'm president of the company now.

505
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:45,656
I don't care if you're president of the company!

506
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,866
I need the voucher now!

507
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,537
Look, why don't you work in here with me?

508
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,914
Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?

509
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:59,003
Well, of course. I went to the Muncie Secretarial, uh, Polytechnic.

510
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,046
A Muncie girl! Can you beat that?

511
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,550
I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes.

512
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,552
Please, Norville.

513
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:10,639
- Go, Eagles! Heh.  - Go, Eagles!

514
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,937
"Once the Munce..." Holy moly!

515
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:20,399
Is this guy from Chumpsville? I even pulled the old mother routine.

516
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,775
- Adenoids?  - Lumbago.

517
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:24,111
Phew. That gag's got whiskers on it.

518
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:25,404
I tell you, the Hudsucker board's up to something.

519
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,783
What's a six-letter word for an affliction of the hypothalamus?

520
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,453
- And it's a cinch... Goiter.  - This guy isn't in on it.

521
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:35,289
- She's right here.  - How much time to make the late final?

522
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,791
- Chief.  - Tsk. Hiya, chief.

523
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:39,877
Just the person I wanted to apologize to.

524
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:43,756
- About seven minutes.  - Yeah, I was all wet about your Idea Man.

525
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:48,719
Well, thanks for being so generous. It is human and you are divine.

526
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,263
No, he's no faker.

527
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:54,767
He's 100 percent real McCoy, beware of imitations, genuine article.

528
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:58,354
The guy's a real moron, as in a five-letter word for imbecile.

529
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:01,690
Oh, as pure a specimen as I've ever run across. Okay.

530
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,276
If working at the Argus doesn't make me an expert...

531
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:07,988
then my name isn't Amy Archer and I never won the Pulitzer Prize.

532
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:09,823
In 1957.

533
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:13,285
My, oh, my series on the reunited triplets.

534
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:16,747
Well, come down here, hammerhead, and I'll show it to you!

535
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,291
What's a three-letter word for a flightless bird?

536
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:20,501
Not now, I'm busy.

537
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,670
Right, I said, "hammerhead," as in a 10-letter word for a smug...

538
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,047
bullying newspaper man.

539
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,049
Gnu. Who couldn't find... That's G-N-U.

540
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,594
Couldn't find the Empire State Building with a compass, map and a guide.

541
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:33,764
Or is it Emu? That's just potatoes. Here comes the gravy.

542
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,265
The chump really likes me.

543
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:38,352
- Ah. A Muncie girl!  - Better off falling for a rattlesnake.

544
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,105
This guy's just a patsy and I'm gonna find out what for.

545
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,315
There's a real story here, some kind of plot.

546
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:45,484
A set-up. Oh, and say, did I tell you?

547
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,403
- He didn't odder you money?  - A sawbuck!

548
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,571
Ten smackers! Let's grab a highball!

549
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,448
- On Norville Barnes.  - Yeah.

550
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,410
Copy!

551
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,149
Ms. Smith, would you come in and take a letter?

552
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:28,569
Of all the cockamamy...

553
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:33,198
Did you see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?

554
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:37,578
Well, I, uh, didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.

555
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:39,746
Well, the picture's fine.

556
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:42,249
It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath.

557
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:44,918
Of all the irresponsible... Take this down.

558
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:47,212
Dear, Ms. Archer.

559
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:50,966
I call you "Miss" because you seem to have missed the boat completely.

560
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,135
How would you know if I'm an imbecile?

561
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,929
You didn't have the guts to come interview me man-to-man!

562
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,848
Change "man-to-man" to "face-to-face."

563
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:01,226
Change "face-to-face" to "eye-to-eye" and "guts" to "common decency."

564
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,562
These wild speculations about my intelligence...

565
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,064
these preposterous inventions would be suited...

566
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:09,026
to the pages of Amazing Tales Magazine.

567
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,487
If the editors of the Manhattan Argus see fit...

568
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,906
to publish the rantings of a disordered mind...

569
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,492
perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter.

570
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,118
But I most seriously doubt it.

571
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:21,288
As I doubt also that you could find a home at Amazing Tales...

572
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:24,082
a periodical which I have enjoyed for many years.

573
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:27,127
Sincerely, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

574
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,761
Is that all, Mr. Barnes?

575
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,304
Uh...

576
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:41,391
You know me, Amy, better than this dame. Do you think I'm an imbecile?

577
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,435
Oh, well, I'm sure I...

578
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:46,855
Tell the truth. I trust you. I place a lot of stock in your opinion.

579
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,859
- Well...  - Oh, sure, heh, you're biased.

580
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,110
You're a fellow Muncian, heh.

581
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:58,283
But let me ask you a question: Would an imbecile come up with this?

582
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,999
I designed it myself.

583
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:10,337
This sweet baby will put Hudsucker right back on top.

584
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,299
You know, for kids.

585
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,596
Why don't I just type this up?

586
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:22,641
Oh, no, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it.

587
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,143
She's just doing her job, I guess.

588
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:27,854
I don't know, maybe she does deserve it.

589
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:31,108
Maybe she should have come in here and faced you man-to-man.

590
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,317
She had a deadline.

591
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:36,530
Sure, but she still could've gotten your side, for the record.

592
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,533
Well, it's done now. What's the use of grousing about it? Ha, ha.

593
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,953
Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some steam. Heh.

594
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,872
She's probably just a little confused.

595
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:49,835
- Confused?  - She's probably a fast-talking career gal...

596
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,754
thinks she's one of the boys. If you know what I mean, heh.

597
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:55,507
Oh, I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.

598
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:58,176
Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays.

599
00:43:58,386 --> 00:43:59,678
Seems pretty obvious.

600
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,472
She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.

601
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:04,349
- Oh, is that it?  - Yeah.

602
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,435
She probably dresses in men's clothing...

603
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,729
drinks with the guys at the watering hole...

604
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:11,398
hobnobs with some smooth-talking heel named Bidd...

605
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:13,358
or Smoocher or, uh...  - Smitty.

606
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:15,902
Exactly. I bet she's ugly, real ugly.

607
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:18,614
Otherwise, why isn't her picture next to her byline?

608
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:22,117
Oh, maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.

609
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,411
I bet that's exactly what she tells herself.

610
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:27,164
But you and I both know she's a dried-up, bitter old maid.

611
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,751
Amy, how about we grab a little dinner and a show after work?

612
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,502
I was thinking maybe The King and I.

613
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:35,339
Uh, how about Oklahoma!?

614
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:38,050
Norville, you don't know a thing about that woman!

615
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:39,760
You don't know who she really is.

616
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:42,304
And only a numbskull thinks he knows things...

617
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,640
about things he knows nothing, uh, about.

618
00:44:46,643 --> 00:44:48,894
Say, what gives?

619
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,730
The inventory of the Jacksonville...

620
00:46:56,939 --> 00:47:00,233
facility should be reduced by 15 percent.

621
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:02,402
Memo from the desk of Sidney J. Mussburger...

622
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:05,155
What are you doing down there, Ms. Archer?

623
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,990
Huh?

624
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:17,292
Who are you? How did you know who I am?

625
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:23,215
I suspect Old Moses knows just about everything...

626
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:26,218
leastways if it concerns Hudsucker.

627
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:28,553
But who are you? What do you do here?

628
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:33,892
I keep the old circle turning. This old clock needs plenty of care.

629
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,353
Time is money, Ms. Archer.

630
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:39,189
And money drives that old global economy...

631
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,733
and keeps Big Daddy Earth spinning around.

632
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:45,111
- See, without that capital formation...  - Yeah, yeah.

633
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:48,740
Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?

634
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:53,954
I don't tell no one nothing unless they ask.

635
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:56,581
That just ain't Old Moses' way.

636
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,750
So if you know everything about Hudsucker...

637
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,087
tell me why the board decided to make Norville Barnes president?

638
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:05,549
Well, that even surprised Old Moses at first.

639
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:08,802
- I didn't think the board was that smart.  - "That smart"?

640
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,929
But then I figured it out.

641
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,182
They did it because they figured young Norville for an imbecile...

642
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:15,934
like some other people I know.

643
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:19,688
Now, why on earth would the board want a nitwit to be president?

644
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:24,109
Because they're little piglets. They're trying to inspire panic...

645
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:27,696
make that stock cheap so they can snatch it all up for themselves.

646
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:32,075
But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve. He does.

647
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:34,160
You know, for kids.

648
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:38,999
Yeah, he's a smart one, that Norville.

649
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:42,627
But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does...

650
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:43,795
do you, Ms. Archer?

651
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:47,632
- Well, maybe I...  - And only some kind of knuckle-head...

652
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:50,635
thinks she knows things about things she, uh...

653
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:54,389
When she don't, uh...

654
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:57,934
- How'd that go?  - Well, it's hardly the same.

655
00:48:58,144 --> 00:49:00,604
Why, you don't even know your own self.

656
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:04,482
You ain't exactly the genuine article, are you, Ms. Archer?

657
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:06,818
Yes, well, in connection with my job...

658
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:09,529
sometimes I have to, uh, go undercover, as it were.

659
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:11,489
I don't mean that.

660
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:15,660
Why are you pretending to be such a hard old sourpuss?

661
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,163
Ain't gonna never make you happy.

662
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,500
I'm happy enough.

663
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:26,171
Okay, Ms. Archer.

664
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:29,299
I got gears to see to.

665
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:36,806
I'm plenty happy!

666
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,689
Hello?

667
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:48,944
- I can't print that!  - Why not? It's all true.

668
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:51,863
The board's using him to depress the stock to buy it cheap.

669
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:53,990
It's pure speculation! They'd have my butt in a satchel!

670
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,577
- Ah. Old satchel butt.  - I know they're gonna buy that stock.

671
00:49:57,787 --> 00:49:59,245
You don't. They haven't bought it.

672
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:01,623
The stock's cheap! What are they waiting for?

673
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,292
- I don't know.  - Amy's hunches are usually pretty good.

674
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:07,170
You don't accuse somebody of stock manipulation on a hunch.

675
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,673
The readers aren't interested in sensationalism...

676
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:12,717
gossip, unsupported speculation! Facts! Figures! Charts!

677
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:14,886
Those are the tools of the newspaper trade.

678
00:50:15,096 --> 00:50:18,181
It's as if you're trying to take the heat off this Barnes numbskull.

679
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:20,517
Oh, come on, chief. That's a low blow.

680
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:23,353
Archer's not going to go gooey for a corn-fed idiot.

681
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:26,856
I was out of line. But you're out of line with this stock-swindle story.

682
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:29,275
Give me more of that "moron from Sheboygan" studd.

683
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:30,860
- Muncie.  - Whatever.

684
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,404
That's what sells newspapers!

685
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:35,156
I've got a harder story, "The Sap From The City Desk!"

686
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,826
- Watch it!  - It's about a dim-witted editor who...

687
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,036
Easy, tough guy. Heh-heh-heh.

688
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,624
Does this suit look mannish to you?

689
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:47,127
Yeah, sure. Let's grab a highball.

690
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:49,170
Back off!

691
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,089
Smoocher!

692
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:55,343
Eh. What gives?

693
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:13,903
A man of great managerial potency.

694
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:16,448
My husband is also a president.

695
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:19,951
Sears Braithwaite of Bullard. Do you know him?

696
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:22,495
Your companion is an ode!

697
00:51:22,705 --> 00:51:25,123
A lyric! Are you betrothed?

698
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,709
Amy works in my office. She runs, uh...

699
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:32,255
- Oh, the folly of youth.  - Those green remembered hills.

700
00:51:32,465 --> 00:51:35,884
That bourn from which no traveler returns.

701
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,219
I once ran the mimeograph for Sidney.

702
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:41,723
Though engaged at the time to quelqu'un d'autre...

703
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:45,643
my water-cooler romance became a mad passion.

704
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:53,651
I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man...

705
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:55,361
Pierre of 5th Avenue.  - Oh!

706
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:57,155
- Do you know him?  - Do you know him?

707
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:02,327
Sidney and I are planning a trip to Paris and points continental.

708
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:06,498
- Oh.  - Aren't we, dear?

709
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:12,670
For sure. I would like to borrow Norville for a while, if you don't mind, dear.

710
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,632
Oh, well, uh, frankly, I...

711
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,675
You have a very charming wife, Mr... Sid.

712
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:19,511
So they tell me.

713
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,223
Norville, let me shepherd you through some of the introductions here.

714
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:25,517
Try not to talk too much.

715
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:28,186
Some of our biggest stockholders are...

716
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,146
Scratch that. Say whatever you like.

717
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:32,649
Shake hands here with Sears Braithwaite of Bullard.

718
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:35,151
- Sir.  - Glad to know you, Barnes.

719
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:37,028
And this is Zebulon Cardozo...

720
00:52:37,238 --> 00:52:40,240
one of Hudsucker's largest and most loyal stockholders.

721
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:42,534
What's this I hear about you being an imbecile?

722
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:44,536
What's ailing you, boy?

723
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:47,747
Last week, my stock was worth twice what it is now.

724
00:52:47,957 --> 00:52:50,667
I'm getting out of the whole kit and caboodle of it, boy...

725
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,253
unless I see a vast improvement.

726
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:56,214
What you've got here, son, is a range war!

727
00:52:56,423 --> 00:53:00,176
You're gonna have to circle our wagons or I'm gonna get out of your wagon train.

728
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:02,887
No need for concern, sir.

729
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:05,181
It's only natural in a period of transition...

730
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:07,183
for the more timid elements to run.

731
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:10,186
Yellow? I'll show you yellow, boy!

732
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:13,898
Zebulon, you mind now and quit acting like such an old grizzly.

733
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:16,568
Step lively here, Norville.

734
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:19,737
I'm sorry, Sid, uh, I thought maybe if I showed him the long view...

735
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:22,824
And this is Thorstenson Finlandson...

736
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,952
who heads a radical splinter group of disgruntled investors.

737
00:53:26,162 --> 00:53:27,829
Ah. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Finlandson.

738
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,707
It might interest you to know I studied Finnish in high school.

739
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,876
Let see, I hope I'm not too rusty. Um...

740
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:41,926
Ladies and gentlemen...

741
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:44,345
distinguished members of the Hudsucker board...

742
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:48,600
I give you the Rajah of Romance, the Ministereo of Moonlight...

743
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:51,102
the incredible, the unforgettable...

744
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:55,190
Mr. Vic Tenetta!

745
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:04,115
Rajah, I like that.

746
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:09,078
# Take one fresh and tender kiss #

747
00:54:11,332 --> 00:54:17,295
# Add one stolen night of bliss #

748
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:25,511
# One girl one boy Some grief some joy #

749
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:31,017
# Memories are made of this #

750
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,479
# Don't #

751
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,486
Norville?

752
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:47,242
What happened?

753
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:53,289
Oh, nothing. Just the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.

754
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:56,251
- Let me look.  - Sid found me the ice pack.

755
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,962
Well, let me hold it or you'll have a real shiner.

756
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:00,380
Oh, thanks.

757
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:03,675
I guess people are pretty hot over this imbecile story.

758
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:05,468
I'm sorry.

759
00:55:05,678 --> 00:55:06,970
Oh, it's not your fault, Amy.

760
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:09,597
You're the one person standing by me through this.

761
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:13,434
Norville, there's something I have to tell you.

762
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:17,772
You see, I'm not really a secretary.

763
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,733
- I know that, Amy.  - You do?

764
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:24,028
I understand you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts...

765
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:27,198
but I'll tell you a secret, I'm not that skilled as president.

766
00:55:27,408 --> 00:55:31,619
- I know I put up a big front, but, uh...  - I believe in you, Norville.

767
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:36,541
At least, I believe in your intentions.

768
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:40,586
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I suppose I have made a mess of things.

769
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:42,880
Those folks have to protect their investment.

770
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:44,716
Most of them are very nice people.

771
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:48,177
Listen, Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie.

772
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:50,221
Certain people are...

773
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:54,225
See, did you ever go to the top of Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?

774
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:56,894
- What?  - On Farm Route 17?

775
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:59,647
Oh, yes, in Muncie.

776
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:06,446
- No, Vidalia. Farm Route 17.  - Oh, yes, 17, yes.

777
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,865
I... Well, no, no. I never really.

778
00:56:10,451 --> 00:56:14,287
The guys from the Varsity Squad would bring their dates up there to...

779
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:16,998
hold hands.

780
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,752
Of course, I never made Varsity.

781
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:24,756
There's a place I go now.

782
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:27,884
Cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village.

783
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:31,637
It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.

784
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:33,431
- You don't say?  - Yes.

785
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,600
- A beatnik bar.  - You can get carrot juice...

786
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:40,772
or Italian coddee and the people there, well, none of them quite fit in.

787
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:41,939
You'd love it.

788
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:44,192
Why don't you come there with me?

789
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,779
There's a marathon poetry-reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.

790
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:50,114
- It's marvelous.  - Every year?

791
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:56,621
Well, this year, if it's good, I plan to make it a tradition, heh.

792
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,498
I, uh, heh...

793
00:56:58,707 --> 00:57:05,588
My, it certainly is beautiful. The people look like ants.

794
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:09,634
Well, the Hindus say, and the beatniks also...

795
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:12,970
that in our next lives some of us will come back as ants.

796
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,765
Some will be butterflies, others will be elephants...

797
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:17,266
or creatures of the sea.

798
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:18,851
What a beautiful thought.

799
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:22,647
Hey, what do you think you were in a previous life, Amy?

800
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:27,068
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just, uh...

801
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:31,155
a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys.

802
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:32,782
Oh, no, Amy.

803
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,701
Pardon me for saying so, but I find that very far-fetched.

804
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:38,496
- No, I have to tell you...  - That person would come back...

805
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,081
as a wildebeest or a warthog.

806
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:45,878
No, I find it more likely that you were a gazelle...

807
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:50,383
with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush.

808
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,718
Perhaps we met once.

809
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:56,597
A chance encounter in a forest glade.

810
00:57:57,558 --> 00:58:01,144
I must have been an antelope or an ibex.

811
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:05,481
The times we must've had foraging together for sustenance...

812
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:08,860
snorfling water from a mountain stream...

813
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:13,656
picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats.

814
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:21,038
Or perhaps we simply touched horns briefly and went our separate ways.

815
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:25,001
Oh, I wish it were that simple, Norville.

816
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:30,089
I wish I was still a gazelle and you were an antelope...

817
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:32,675
or an ibex.

818
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,803
Well...

819
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:39,223
can I at least call you "deer?"

820
00:58:42,603 --> 00:58:43,644
You're funny.

821
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:47,106
Seriously, Amy, it's what your beatnik friends call "karma."

822
00:58:47,316 --> 00:58:50,526
- Karma.  - The great circle of life, death and rebirth.

823
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:55,239
Yes, I think I heard of that. What goes around, comes around.

824
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:59,243
That's it. A great wheel that gives us all what we deserve.

825
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:03,080
I gotta show Sid and all the guys I deserve their confidence.

826
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:05,708
Tomorrow's my big presentation to the board.

827
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:11,756
Kiss me, Amy! Kiss me once for luck.

828
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:16,552
Sure, Norville, sure.

829
00:59:50,379 --> 00:59:52,171
Shh.

830
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:57,218
You know, for kids!

831
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,637
It has economy, simplicity, low production cost...

832
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,138
potential for mass appeal.

833
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:03,307
All that spells out great profitability.

834
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:06,310
I had the boys down at R&D throw together this prototype...

835
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,521
so our discussion could have some focus...

836
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:12,191
and to give you gentleman a firsthand look at how exciting this gizmo is.

837
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:15,653
It's fun, healthy, good exercise, and the kids will just love it.

838
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:18,823
We put a little sand inside to make the experience more pleasant.

839
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:22,326
But the great part is we don't have to charge an arm and a leg.

840
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,747
What if you tire before it's done?

841
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:27,957
Does it have rules?

842
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,126
- Can more than one play?  - It's a game?

843
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,627
- Is it a game?  - Will it break?

844
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:34,171
- It better break eventually.  - Is there an object?

845
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:37,008
- What if you tire before it's done?  - Does it have batteries?

846
01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:39,468
- Could we charge extra for them?  - Is it safe for toddlers?

847
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:41,304
How do you know you're finished?

848
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:42,513
How does it stop?

849
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:44,974
- Is that a boy's model?  - Can a parent assemble it?

850
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,620
What if you tire before it's done?

851
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,020
Is there a larger model for the obese?

852
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:51,439
What the hell is it?

853
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:55,234
Well, it's a... It's a...

854
01:00:55,444 --> 01:00:56,444
It's a...

855
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:57,695
Brilliant!

856
01:00:59,615 --> 01:01:01,198
Genius.

857
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:05,369
It's exactly what Hudsucker Industry needs at this juncture.

858
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:06,704
Sure, sure.

859
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:11,917
Even a blind man can tell you there'll be an enormous demand for this, uh...

860
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:13,919
This...

861
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:15,212
Congratulations, kid.

862
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:17,840
You've outdone yourself. You've reinvented the wheel.

863
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:22,595
I'll recommend to the board that we proceed immediately and that the, uh...

864
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,847
And that the, uh...

865
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:28,559
dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed.

866
01:01:28,769 --> 01:01:30,853
Although, you realize...

867
01:01:31,063 --> 01:01:33,064
of course...

868
01:01:35,567 --> 01:01:37,234
as president...

869
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:40,196
the ultimate decision is yours.

870
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:42,490
Oh. I'm for it.

871
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:31,789
We'll call it the Flying Doughnut!

872
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:32,957
The Dancing Dingus!

873
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,458
The Belly-Go-Round.

874
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:35,626
The Swingerina!

875
01:02:35,836 --> 01:02:36,130
The Wacky Circumference!

876
01:02:36,939 --> 01:02:38,779
Uncle Midriff!

877
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:11,746
- We need something short!  - Sharp!

878
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:13,497
- Snappy!  - With a little jazz!

879
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:14,832
The Shazzammeter!

880
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,041
The Hipster!

881
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:17,585
The Daddy-O!

882
01:03:58,919 --> 01:04:00,628
- The Hoopsucker.  - The Hudswinger.

883
01:04:00,809 --> 01:04:02,319
- The Hoopsucker!  - The Hudswinger!

884
01:04:02,399 --> 01:04:04,149
- The Hoopsucker!  - The Hudswinger!

885
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:33,786
- Fellas!  - You got something?

886
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,079
You got something?

887
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:38,249
Fella, I got something!

888
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:53,013
Ladies.

889
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:27,292
Wow.

890
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:43,767
Norville!

891
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:54,611
Rockwell News presents, Tidbits of Time.

892
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:57,614
World news in pictures, we kid you not.

893
01:07:57,824 --> 01:08:01,452
As Old Man 1958 hobbles towards his finish...

894
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:04,121
Barnes is the name on every American lip.

895
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:07,666
Norville Barnes, young president of Hudsucker Industries...

896
01:08:07,876 --> 01:08:11,754
a boy bred in the heartland, but now the toast of New York.

897
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:15,299
Barnes is the brainy inventor of America's craziest craze:

898
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:16,842
The Hula-Hoop!

899
01:08:17,052 --> 01:08:20,471
Reaping huge profits for his company and winning the hearts...

900
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,766
and hips of every youngster in America!

901
01:08:23,975 --> 01:08:26,560
Woo-ho. Did I say youngster?

902
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:30,064
Here's Mom taking a break from her household chores...

903
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:33,817
and even Dad is swinging into the act!

904
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:36,487
Cards, letters, congratulations...

905
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:39,656
come pouring in from Kankakee to Petaluma...

906
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:42,951
including one very special long-distance call.

907
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:45,871
He's on! He's on the line!

908
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:52,669
- Hello?  - Hello, Norville.

909
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:54,713
- This is the President.  - Oh, my God, sir.

910
01:08:54,923 --> 01:08:57,841
I just wanted to congratulate you. I'm very proud of you.

911
01:08:58,051 --> 01:09:01,261
- Oh, my God, sir.  - Mrs. Eisenhower is very proud of you.

912
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:04,431
The American people are very proud of you.

913
01:09:09,938 --> 01:09:14,108
Mr. Barnes, how'd you come up with the idea for the Hula-Hoop?

914
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:16,026
It was no great idea, really.

915
01:09:16,236 --> 01:09:18,737
A thing like this takes a whole company to put together.

916
01:09:18,947 --> 01:09:20,531
I'm grateful for the opportunity.

917
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:23,450
Did you have any idea there'd be such a huge response?

918
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,912
Frankly, I don't think anybody expected this much hoopla.

919
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:31,959
"Hoopla on the Hula-Hoop." Can we quote you on that, Mr. Barnes?

920
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:33,210
Sure, I guess.

921
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:36,630
Mr. Barnes, will you give yourself a nice, fat raise?

922
01:09:38,049 --> 01:09:39,508
Come on, you guys.

923
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:49,393
What scientific principle explains the mind-bending motion...

924
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:51,395
of this whipping wheel of wonder?

925
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:53,605
The dingus is quite simple, really.

926
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:55,524
It operates on the same principles...

927
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:58,026
that keep the Earth spinning around the sun...

928
01:09:58,236 --> 01:10:00,821
and that keeps you from flying off the Earth...

929
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,698
into the cold reaches of space...

930
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:05,200
where you would die like a miserable swine.

931
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:07,786
Yes, the principle is the same...

932
01:10:07,996 --> 01:10:12,791
except for the piece of grit they put in to make the experience...

933
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:14,376
more pleasant.

934
01:10:14,586 --> 01:10:16,879
Yes, it's Hula-Hula everywhere!

935
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:19,590
From the parties of the Park Avenue smart set...

936
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:26,847
to sweethearts who want to be married in the swing of things.

937
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:32,144
Mr. Barnes, did the board consider you an idea man...

938
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:34,479
when they promoted you from the mailroom?

939
01:10:34,689 --> 01:10:38,275
I guess so, I don't think they promoted me because they thought I was a schmo.

940
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:41,236
Mr. Barnes, what's the next big idea for you and Hudsucker?

941
01:10:41,446 --> 01:10:42,446
Jesus, I don't know.

942
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:45,032
An idea like this sweet baby doesn't just come overnight.

943
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:49,161
Although, I'll tell you one thing, I certainly didn't expect all this hoopla.

944
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:51,496
You can quote me on that.

945
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:01,798
Rumpus Magazine has called you the most eligible bachelor.

946
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:04,968
And society pages have been linking you with fashion model Za-Za.

947
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:07,638
- You care to comment?  - There's no truth to the rumors.

948
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:10,390
We're just dear friends. Isn't that right, Za-Za?

949
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:13,894
Wow.

950
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:15,312
Ooh.

951
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:19,483
Whoa. How do you respond to the charges that you're out of ideas?

952
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:21,318
Has Norville Barnes run dry?

953
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:25,364
Not at all. Just this week I came up with several new sweet ideas.

954
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:30,077
A larger model Hula-Hoop for the portly, a battery option for the lazy or spastic.

955
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,829
A model with extra sand for the hard-of-hearing.

956
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:34,248
I'm earning my keep.

957
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:36,792
Speaking of that, do you expect to get a raise?

958
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:41,338
By anyone's account, I single-handedly have saved Hudsucker Industries.

959
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:43,507
Our stock is worth more now than ever.

960
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:46,426
Yes, I expect to be compensated for that.

961
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:10,158
- Pull yourself together, man.  - Nobody told me!

962
01:12:10,368 --> 01:12:12,995
You sold all our stock?

963
01:12:13,204 --> 01:12:14,413
We dumped the whole load.

964
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:17,582
I had 20,000 shares!

965
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:19,501
I'd be a millionaire now.

966
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:22,212
Sure. We'd all be millionaires.

967
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:24,047
There's no point in looking back.

968
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:28,885
At the time, Stillson thought dumping our position would panic the market...

969
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:31,305
further depress the stock.

970
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:35,058
Then we could buy it back and more, of course, once it got cheap.

971
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:39,104
Cheap? It's never been more valuable!

972
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:43,775
And I'm ruined. Ruined!

973
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:49,740
Addison.

974
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:54,077
I'm getting off this merry-go-round!

975
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:56,079
Myron.

976
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,047
Plexiglas.

977
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:07,591
Had it installed last week.

978
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:18,643
Myron?

979
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:23,982
All right, so the kid caught a wave.

980
01:13:24,692 --> 01:13:28,653
Right now, he and his dingus are on top.

981
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:31,031
Well, this too shall pass.

982
01:13:31,491 --> 01:13:34,993
Myrtle J. Mussburger did not raise her boy to go...

983
01:13:35,203 --> 01:13:37,746
knock-kneed at the first sign of adversity.

984
01:13:37,955 --> 01:13:41,541
I say, we made this chump, we can break him!

985
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:45,295
I say, the higher he climbs, the harder he drops!

986
01:13:46,381 --> 01:13:48,090
I say, yes...

987
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:51,051
the kid has a future...

988
01:13:51,469 --> 01:13:53,136
and in it...

989
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:56,098
I see shame, dishonor...

990
01:13:56,307 --> 01:13:59,393
ignominy, disgrace.

991
01:13:59,727 --> 01:14:01,853
Sure, sure.

992
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:05,649
The music plays, the wheel turns...

993
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:08,735
and our spin ain't over yet.

994
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,302
For Pete's sakes, Norville!

995
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:36,680
Oh, Amy, where have you been hiding?

996
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:40,100
Do you know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?

997
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:42,144
I wouldn't call them nincompoops.

998
01:14:42,353 --> 01:14:44,604
They're discharging 80 percent of the workforce.

999
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:47,649
In New York City alone, that means 1800 people out of work!

1000
01:14:47,859 --> 01:14:49,443
People with wives, children and families!

1001
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:52,696
Oh, yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood.

1002
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:56,241
- You mean you know about this?  - Know about it? Sure.

1003
01:14:56,451 --> 01:14:59,411
You think the board would do anything without my authorization?

1004
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:01,204
It was my idea from the start.

1005
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:02,706
- Your...  - Sure, it was.

1006
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:05,542
We're in a period of transition here. Things have slowed.

1007
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:08,253
You're being awfully kind to yourself, Norville Barnes.

1008
01:15:08,463 --> 01:15:12,048
You've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work.

1009
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:14,718
You know ideas are the lifeblood of industry...

1010
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:17,220
and you haven't come up with one since the Hoop.

1011
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:20,015
You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting to you.

1012
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:22,476
If it wasn't for the fame, wealth, the adulation...

1013
01:15:22,685 --> 01:15:24,060
Would you get out of here?

1014
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:27,397
You too, sisters, move it. Out, out, out!

1015
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:31,401
I've been watching you, even though you've been avoiding me.

1016
01:15:31,611 --> 01:15:32,569
Shut up!

1017
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:35,030
Don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed.

1018
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:36,907
I used to think you were a swell guy.

1019
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:38,909
I thought you were an imbecile.

1020
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:40,118
- Amy, I'm...  - Shut up!

1021
01:15:40,328 --> 01:15:41,822
Then I figured out you were a swell guy.

1022
01:15:42,022 --> 01:15:43,622
A little slow, but a swell guy.

1023
01:15:43,831 --> 01:15:47,167
Maybe you're not so slow, oh, but you're not so swell either.

1024
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:49,753
Looks like you're an imbecile, after all. Shut up!

1025
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:53,632
You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece.

1026
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:56,593
Look, I've never been...

1027
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:59,596
dumped by a fella before, and that hurts...

1028
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:02,432
but what really hurts is watching you outrun your soul!

1029
01:16:02,642 --> 01:16:05,268
Chasing after money and ease and the respect of a board...

1030
01:16:05,478 --> 01:16:07,854
that wouldn't give you the time of day if you...

1031
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:10,607
- lf you...  - Worked in a watch factory?

1032
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:14,027
Shut up! Exactly.

1033
01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:18,448
Norville, don't you remember how you used to feel about the Hoop?

1034
01:16:18,658 --> 01:16:22,410
You told me you'd gonna bring a smile to the hips of everyone in America...

1035
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:24,621
regardless of race, creed or color.

1036
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:28,124
Finally, there'd be a thingamajig that would bring everyone together...

1037
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:30,961
even if it kept them apart spatially.

1038
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:33,964
"You know, for kids."

1039
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:38,301
Your words, Norville, not mine.

1040
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:41,054
I used to love Norville Barnes.

1041
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:44,140
Yes, love him...

1042
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:48,019
when he was just a swell kid with hot ideas who was in over his head.

1043
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:50,146
Now your head's too big to be in over!

1044
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:52,816
- Hey.  - Consider this my resignation.

1045
01:16:54,485 --> 01:16:56,111
Effective immediately!

1046
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:18,526
Buddy, buddy.

1047
01:18:18,736 --> 01:18:20,904
Buddy.

1048
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:23,907
Buddy. Buddy, say, buddy.

1049
01:18:25,618 --> 01:18:27,452
Buddy, say, buddy.

1050
01:18:27,995 --> 01:18:31,373
Uh... Huh?

1051
01:18:31,582 --> 01:18:33,249
Buddy. You busy?

1052
01:18:33,793 --> 01:18:34,793
Huh?

1053
01:18:35,002 --> 01:18:38,213
Looks like you nodded off there, buddy. Say, you got a minute?

1054
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:41,925
Buzz?

1055
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:43,426
Is this important?

1056
01:18:43,636 --> 01:18:46,763
I think so. It's this little idea I've been working on.

1057
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:49,432
You see, I don't intend to be an elevator boy forever.

1058
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:51,101
Take a look at this sweet baby!

1059
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:53,603
Get it? Incredibly convenient, isn't it?

1060
01:18:53,813 --> 01:18:55,271
You know, for drinks?

1061
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:57,691
This is how it works. It's got these ridges...

1062
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,609
on the side that give it its whammy.

1063
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:03,363
See, you don't have to drink like this anymore. You can drink like this.

1064
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:06,074
I call it the Buzz-Sucker. You get it, buddy?

1065
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:09,494
People are dying for this and we won't have to charge an arm an...

1066
01:19:09,704 --> 01:19:11,121
Wait a minute.

1067
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:13,123
Shh.

1068
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:27,804
This...

1069
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:31,266
is worthless!

1070
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:33,059
Huh? But, buddy...

1071
01:19:33,269 --> 01:19:35,270
This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen.

1072
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:36,479
Yeah, but, buddy...

1073
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:38,732
Nobody wants a harebrained product like this.

1074
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:42,110
You see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark...

1075
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:45,572
the unalloyed genius that made something like, say...

1076
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,907
the, uh, Hula-Hoop such a success.

1077
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:50,368
What do you mean barging in and taking up my time?

1078
01:19:50,578 --> 01:19:52,120
I've got a company to run here!

1079
01:19:53,748 --> 01:19:55,498
- But, buddy...  - I can't have every deadbeat...

1080
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:58,710
on the payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves.

1081
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:00,336
I'm sorry, buddy.

1082
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:02,922
- An example must be made.  - What do you mean, buddy?

1083
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,342
You're fired.

1084
01:20:06,552 --> 01:20:08,636
Is that plain enough for you, buster?

1085
01:20:13,893 --> 01:20:15,435
Oh, buddy!

1086
01:20:16,187 --> 01:20:18,188
And don't call me "buddy."

1087
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:22,859
Oh, please, sir! This job running the elevator, it's all I got!

1088
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:24,778
Uh, it's okay if you don't like it.

1089
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:28,364
Just let me keep my job, I'm praying to you.

1090
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:32,911
Get out of my office! Get up! Up!

1091
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,914
We don't crawl here at Hudsucker Industries!

1092
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:40,877
I'm sorry, sir! I'm sorry!

1093
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:56,935
Thank you, Aloysius.

1094
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:03,191
This is...

1095
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:05,735
useful.

1096
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:28,007
Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale's really murder.

1097
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:31,928
It's a tough course. A real lollapalooza.

1098
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:34,222
Sit down, son.

1099
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:42,605
I thought the boardroom would be a swell place to chat undisturbed.

1100
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:47,151
Seems we've got some security problems here at the Hud.

1101
01:21:47,361 --> 01:21:48,778
You don't say.

1102
01:21:48,988 --> 01:21:51,239
Ordinarily, I wouldn't bother you with it...

1103
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:53,616
but this is embarrassing.

1104
01:21:54,285 --> 01:21:56,411
It concerns you directly.

1105
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:59,247
- How's that, Sid?  - It's not serious in itself.

1106
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:03,084
Some elevator boy that you'd fired came to me...

1107
01:22:03,294 --> 01:22:07,255
claiming that you'd stolen the idea for, um, the dingus.

1108
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:09,424
You'd stolen it from him.

1109
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:14,721
- Maybe I was a little rough on him...  - Forget it.

1110
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:18,224
You don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing.

1111
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:19,809
Fire whoever you want.

1112
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:25,982
No, the problem is who you hired.

1113
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:30,028
That dame. A spy, as it turns out.

1114
01:22:30,237 --> 01:22:33,698
She must have gotten to that elevator schnook...

1115
01:22:33,908 --> 01:22:37,035
and her paper is going to town.

1116
01:22:37,244 --> 01:22:42,665
Sure, sure, we tried to kill the story, but the Argus won't play ball.

1117
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:46,002
The problem the board will have is you hired this woman...

1118
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:48,838
and you kept her on...

1119
01:22:49,048 --> 01:22:51,841
while she was making a chump out of you.

1120
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:54,594
Serious error in judgment.

1121
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:57,597
Business is war, kid.

1122
01:22:57,806 --> 01:23:00,850
Take no prisoners, give no second chances.

1123
01:23:04,313 --> 01:23:06,856
When the board meets after New Year's...

1124
01:23:07,066 --> 01:23:08,983
your position...

1125
01:23:11,362 --> 01:23:13,196
Looks like you're finished.

1126
01:23:13,697 --> 01:23:15,281
Washed up.

1127
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:22,789
Oh, fourteenth hole at Riverdale...

1128
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:26,960
some use a mashie, some use a niblick.

1129
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:28,753
Niblick.

1130
01:23:28,963 --> 01:23:31,214
You get more loft, more backspin.

1131
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:37,971
That dame...

1132
01:23:38,806 --> 01:23:41,891
she got your throat pretty well slit.

1133
01:23:42,101 --> 01:23:44,060
When you're dead, you stay dead.

1134
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:48,189
You don't believe me, ask Waring Hudsucker.

1135
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:54,237
Tough luck, kid. You had a short climb up.

1136
01:23:54,655 --> 01:23:56,781
It's a long way down.

1137
01:24:07,418 --> 01:24:09,419
Stolen hoop idea from... You can't print that!

1138
01:24:09,628 --> 01:24:10,628
We are printing it!

1139
01:24:10,838 --> 01:24:12,964
She hits the streets this evening.

1140
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:15,049
And she's dynamite!

1141
01:24:15,259 --> 01:24:16,426
But, Al, it's the bunk!

1142
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:19,178
Norville showed me his design the, uh, day I met him.

1143
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:22,223
Buzz couldn't have invented it. Look at him, he's an imbecile.

1144
01:24:22,433 --> 01:24:24,851
Aren't you a broken record? Gunderson did design it.

1145
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,436
Apparently, he's a prodigy.

1146
01:24:26,645 --> 01:24:28,855
- Says who?  - You're not the only one with sources.

1147
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:31,566
Smith has a source on the Hud board. Very hush-hush.

1148
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:34,110
Yeah. I bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger.

1149
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:37,196
You lost it, Amy. You gone soft, by the looks of it.

1150
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:39,073
Soft on the dummy from Dubuque.

1151
01:24:40,117 --> 01:24:41,367
- Muncie  - Whatever!

1152
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:45,371
This story's hot and you're no longer on top of it. It's the scoop of the century!

1153
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:47,665
The other papers won't have this till tomorrow!

1154
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:51,627
They'll be choking on our dust come morning.

1155
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:55,298
You're fools, both of you! You're being used, don't you see, ugh?

1156
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:58,676
Take a break. You worked hard on this story. You broke it for us.

1157
01:24:58,886 --> 01:25:01,929
But it's passed you by and Smith's taking up the slack.

1158
01:25:02,973 --> 01:25:06,309
Tsk, oh, you want slack, I'll give you slack!

1159
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:10,313
You're not putting me out to pasture! I quit! Consider this my resignation!

1160
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:14,317
Effective immediately!

1161
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:18,404
Soft.

1162
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:28,790
So tell me...

1163
01:25:28,999 --> 01:25:31,751
why do you feel this woman betrayed you?

1164
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:35,338
Tsk, oh, what's the difference?

1165
01:25:35,547 --> 01:25:38,299
The whole world, it seems, is against you?

1166
01:25:38,509 --> 01:25:39,634
I don't know.

1167
01:25:39,843 --> 01:25:41,677
Und the elevator boy...

1168
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:45,056
Buzz, he too works against you?

1169
01:25:45,265 --> 01:25:46,974
Well, yeah.

1170
01:25:47,184 --> 01:25:48,351
Classic.

1171
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,771
Patient displayed listlessness, apathy, gloomy indidderence...

1172
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:54,023
und was blue und mopey.

1173
01:25:54,233 --> 01:25:57,443
When asked what the Rorschach stains represented, patient replied:

1174
01:25:57,945 --> 01:26:02,657
"Nothing much. I don't know. Just a blotch. Sure beats me."

1175
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:06,452
Patient shows no ambition, no get-up-and-go, no vim.

1176
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:09,163
He is riding the grand loopen-ze-loop...

1177
01:26:09,373 --> 01:26:12,208
that goes from the height of delusional gaiety...

1178
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:14,502
to the trough of despair.

1179
01:26:14,711 --> 01:26:17,880
He is now near, but not yet at his lowest point.

1180
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:23,970
When he reaches bottom, he may erupt und pose a danger to himself und others.

1181
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:26,055
Diagnosis, Dr. Bronfenbrenner?

1182
01:26:26,265 --> 01:26:29,225
Patient is eine manic-depressive paranoid, type B...

1183
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:31,310
with acute schizoid tendencies.

1184
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:34,522
So patient is?

1185
01:26:35,274 --> 01:26:37,692
Precisely, nuts!

1186
01:26:38,277 --> 01:26:39,318
Prescription?

1187
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:44,490
Three things, commitment, electroconvulsive therapy...

1188
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:48,161
maintenance in eine secure facility.

1189
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:05,761
Yeah, he's a tall guy. A real mess.

1190
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:10,349
Yeah, yeah, look, you better get down here. He says he's a friend of yours.

1191
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:14,270
He didn't say. But, man, is he from Squaresville.

1192
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:23,613
I want a martini!

1193
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:26,616
It's New Year's Eve. I deserve a martini.

1194
01:27:26,825 --> 01:27:28,120
Daddy, it's like I've been telling you. You can't ...

1195
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:30,620
I thought you served misfits here.

1196
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:34,123
Yeah, daddy. That's a roger. But we don't sell alcohol.

1197
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:36,792
What kind of bar is it, you can't get a martini?

1198
01:27:37,002 --> 01:27:40,463
It's a juice-and-coddee bar, man, like I've been telling you.

1199
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:45,718
- Right. So I want a martini.  - Argh.

1200
01:27:45,928 --> 01:27:49,305
I've had a martini in every bar all the way down here, heh.

1201
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:51,974
Martinis are for squares, man.

1202
01:27:53,435 --> 01:27:56,395
What'd you call me, you beatnik son of a...?

1203
01:27:56,605 --> 01:27:57,605
Norville.

1204
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:00,775
What?

1205
01:28:00,984 --> 01:28:05,404
- Oh-ho, look who's here, Amy Archer...  - Oh, no.

1206
01:28:05,614 --> 01:28:07,782
Prizeter Pule winner.

1207
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:10,076
Looking for a nitwit to buy you lunch?

1208
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:13,955
- Norville, I'm sorry.  - Bar fella, I'd like...

1209
01:28:14,164 --> 01:28:15,164
a martini, please.

1210
01:28:15,374 --> 01:28:19,001
I tried to tell you so many times, I...

1211
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:23,214
It's hard to admit when you've been wrong.

1212
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:25,049
If you could just...

1213
01:28:25,259 --> 01:28:29,887
find it in your heart to give me another chance.

1214
01:28:32,182 --> 01:28:34,433
"You take no prisoners, give no second chances."

1215
01:28:34,643 --> 01:28:38,020
Please, Norville! Please give me one more chance!

1216
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:41,649
And yourself too. We both deserve one.

1217
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:43,192
Just give us a second chance.

1218
01:28:43,402 --> 01:28:45,361
Together we can fight this thing.

1219
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:47,989
I know this last story was a lie and we can prove it.

1220
01:28:48,198 --> 01:28:49,532
You got to release a statement.

1221
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:53,244
- I can help you write it.  - Oh, what's the difference?

1222
01:28:53,453 --> 01:28:55,621
I'm all washed up.

1223
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:59,875
Extinct. Homo sapiens sapicus.

1224
01:29:01,253 --> 01:29:05,673
Well, heh, that just about does it.

1225
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:09,510
I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry...

1226
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:13,222
and I've seen Norville Barnes, the self-important heel.

1227
01:29:13,432 --> 01:29:16,559
But I've never seen Norville Barnes, the quitter...

1228
01:29:17,269 --> 01:29:19,395
and I don't like it.

1229
01:29:20,439 --> 01:29:22,398
Fight on.

1230
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:26,360
Fight on, dear old Muncie.

1231
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:31,532
Fight on. Hoist the gold and blue.

1232
01:29:31,742 --> 01:29:35,453
You'll be tattered, torn and hurting.

1233
01:29:35,662 --> 01:29:40,416
Once the Munce is done with you.

1234
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:44,837
Go, Eagles.

1235
01:29:46,923 --> 01:29:49,383
You can't surrender, Norville. Remember.

1236
01:29:50,761 --> 01:29:55,765
Fight on, Fight on Dear old Muncie

1237
01:29:57,184 --> 01:30:02,355
Fight on Hoist the gold and blue

1238
01:30:03,315 --> 01:30:07,109
You'll be tattered, torn and hurting

1239
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:12,907
You lied to me. How could you lie to me?

1240
01:30:14,743 --> 01:30:18,412
You, a Muncie girl.

1241
01:30:19,706 --> 01:30:22,416
But, Norville, I...

1242
01:30:22,626 --> 01:30:28,964
When you're dead, you stay dead. Just ask Waring Hudsucker!

1243
01:30:30,217 --> 01:30:32,468
Oh, Norville.

1244
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:38,641
Extra, extra! New Year's Eve edition!

1245
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:41,227
Barnes' brain caught red-handed!

1246
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:43,020
Ideas ersatz!

1247
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:46,148
Man from Muncie a moron after all!

1248
01:30:46,358 --> 01:30:48,442
Read all about it!

1249
01:30:48,652 --> 01:30:52,988
New Year's Eve edition! Man from Muncie a moron after all!

1250
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:55,157
You're not so slow, but you're not so swell.

1251
01:30:55,367 --> 01:30:57,493
And it looks like you're an imbecile after all.

1252
01:30:57,702 --> 01:31:00,830
Sure, sure. But your friends called you dope?

1253
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:03,207
Dipstick? Lamebrain? Schmo?

1254
01:31:03,417 --> 01:31:06,419
Please, buddy, running the elevator, it's all I got.

1255
01:31:06,628 --> 01:31:08,587
Norville, you let me down.

1256
01:31:08,797 --> 01:31:13,092
You let Mrs. Eisenhower down. You let the American people down.

1257
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:15,678
- And when you're dead, you stay dead.  - Ha-ha-ha.

1258
01:31:15,887 --> 01:31:19,181
You stay dead, you stay dead. Sure, sure.

1259
01:31:19,391 --> 01:31:22,435
The kid is screwy, it's oddicial.

1260
01:31:23,061 --> 01:31:26,188
The barred-window boys are out looking for him now.

1261
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:28,357
We'll see how Wall Street likes the news...

1262
01:31:28,567 --> 01:31:31,819
that the president of Hudsucker is headed for the booby hatch.

1263
01:31:32,028 --> 01:31:36,323
Heh, when Doc Bronfenbrenner gets through with him...

1264
01:31:36,533 --> 01:31:38,534
he'll need diapers and a dribble cup.

1265
01:31:39,953 --> 01:31:42,371
Well, if that's all...

1266
01:31:42,581 --> 01:31:45,458
Long live the Hud!

1267
01:31:54,593 --> 01:31:57,970
Watch where you're... Hiya, buddy!

1268
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:00,306
- Buzz?  - Out on the town, huh? Guess what?

1269
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:03,478
Sid says I can have my old job back.

1270
01:32:03,678 --> 01:32:05,478
I deserve a second chance, he says.

1271
01:32:09,191 --> 01:32:10,858
- Ha, ha.  - Buzz, that's wonderful.

1272
01:32:11,067 --> 01:32:14,904
He told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives?

1273
01:32:15,113 --> 01:32:18,949
- Buzz, I would never...  - Gee, that was a swell idea.

1274
01:32:19,159 --> 01:32:21,285
And Sid says you stoled it!

1275
01:32:21,495 --> 01:32:23,871
What are you waiting on, Clarence? Pop him one.

1276
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,748
But Buzz...

1277
01:32:34,758 --> 01:32:36,008
He's that big-shot faker!

1278
01:32:36,218 --> 01:32:40,095
- That Wall Street fraud guy.  - Nuttier than a fruitcake.

1279
01:32:41,431 --> 01:32:43,182
Somebody call the cops!

1280
01:33:12,045 --> 01:33:14,797
Ring out the old, ring in the new.

1281
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:17,967
Ring out the old, ring in the new.

1282
01:36:40,545 --> 01:36:42,838
Hey. Hey! Aah!

1283
01:36:47,427 --> 01:36:59,688
Hey.

1284
01:37:59,332 --> 01:38:01,917
Strictly speaking, I'm never supposed to do this...

1285
01:38:02,126 --> 01:38:04,336
but have you got a better idea?

1286
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:25,440
# She'll be driving Six white horses when she comes #

1287
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:27,192
# She'll be driving six white horses #

1288
01:38:33,658 --> 01:38:39,663
# We'll all have chicken and dumplings When she comes #

1289
01:38:40,164 --> 01:38:42,916
# We'll all have chicken and dumplings Yes, we'll all have chicken and dumplings #

1290
01:38:43,126 --> 01:38:45,836
# We'll all have chicken and dumplings When she comes #

1291
01:38:46,045 --> 01:38:52,467
# She'll be coming round the mountain When she comes #

1292
01:38:52,677 --> 01:38:56,513
# She'll be coming round the mountain She'll be coming round the mountain #

1293
01:38:56,723 --> 01:39:00,142
# She'll be coming round the mountain When she comes #

1294
01:39:00,351 --> 01:39:03,270
# She'll be coming round the mountain I said coming round the mountain #

1295
01:39:03,479 --> 01:39:08,901
# Oh, yeah, coming round the mountain When she comes #

1296
01:39:12,155 --> 01:39:15,157
Love that tune. How you doing, kid?

1297
01:39:15,366 --> 01:39:17,242
Mr. Hudsucker?

1298
01:39:18,077 --> 01:39:20,454
How do you like that thing? They're all wearing them upstairs.

1299
01:39:20,663 --> 01:39:23,707
Tsk, it's a fad. Anyway...

1300
01:39:23,917 --> 01:39:27,169
I see you've been having some, uh, problems with the board.

1301
01:39:27,378 --> 01:39:29,838
I guess Sidney's, uh, putting the screws to you, huh, Norman.

1302
01:39:30,048 --> 01:39:31,214
- Norville.  - Yeah, yeah.

1303
01:39:31,424 --> 01:39:33,300
Say what you like about the man's ethics.

1304
01:39:33,509 --> 01:39:35,177
He's a balls-to-the-wall businessman.

1305
01:39:35,386 --> 01:39:38,263
Beat you any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Eddective.

1306
01:39:38,473 --> 01:39:39,681
Any particular reason...

1307
01:39:39,891 --> 01:39:41,808
you didn't give him my blue letter?  - Oh.

1308
01:39:42,018 --> 01:39:45,562
Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.

1309
01:39:45,772 --> 01:39:48,357
Mr. Hudsucker, I must've mislaid it...

1310
01:39:48,566 --> 01:39:51,610
It's in your apron pocket, right where you left it.

1311
01:39:51,819 --> 01:39:52,861
Imbecile.

1312
01:39:53,071 --> 01:39:55,864
Failure to deliver a blue letter is grounds for dismissal.

1313
01:39:56,074 --> 01:39:58,033
- Jeez, sir, I...  - Oh, it's New Year's.

1314
01:39:58,242 --> 01:40:00,535
I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.

1315
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:03,538
Anyway, you wanna read it? You might learn something.

1316
01:40:03,748 --> 01:40:06,375
Might keep you from jumping out of any more windows.

1317
01:40:12,173 --> 01:40:15,801
"Blue letter from the desk of Waring Hudsucker...

1318
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:19,054
to Sidney J. Mussburger, regarding my demise.

1319
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:21,223
Dear, Sid, by the time you read this...

1320
01:40:21,432 --> 01:40:24,226
I will have joined the organization upstairs...

1321
01:40:24,435 --> 01:40:27,729
an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond..."

1322
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:30,983
- Memories.  - "Of the years you and I have spent..."

1323
01:40:31,192 --> 01:40:33,735
Yeah, yeah, standard resignation boilerplate.

1324
01:40:33,945 --> 01:40:35,529
Go down to the second paragraph.

1325
01:40:41,619 --> 01:40:44,663
"You will no doubt be wondering why I've decided to end my tenure...

1326
01:40:44,872 --> 01:40:46,790
both at Hudsucker and here on Earth.

1327
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,626
From the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials...

1328
01:40:49,836 --> 01:40:51,420
sure, sure, we're doing fine.

1329
01:40:51,629 --> 01:40:54,881
But in my personal life, Sidney, I have made grave errors.

1330
01:40:55,091 --> 01:40:57,426
I have let my success become my identity.

1331
01:40:57,635 --> 01:40:59,678
I have foolishly played the great man...

1332
01:40:59,887 --> 01:41:03,557
and watched my life become more and more empty as a result.

1333
01:41:03,766 --> 01:41:08,520
My vanity drove away she who could've saved me.

1334
01:41:08,730 --> 01:41:12,024
Oh, yes, I loved a woman once, Sid, as you well know.

1335
01:41:12,233 --> 01:41:13,942
A beautiful, vibrant lady...

1336
01:41:14,152 --> 01:41:18,155
and angel who, in her wisdom, saw fit to choose you instead of I."

1337
01:41:18,364 --> 01:41:19,781
Mr. Hudsucker.

1338
01:41:25,621 --> 01:41:26,997
Skip this part.

1339
01:41:29,125 --> 01:41:31,585
Next page. Next page!

1340
01:41:41,846 --> 01:41:44,556
"This brings me to our company, Sid, and its future.

1341
01:41:44,766 --> 01:41:47,642
Our next president must have the liberty I have had as owner...

1342
01:41:47,852 --> 01:41:50,771
to experiment and even fall."  - Fail.

1343
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:54,816
"Without fear of the whims of the stockholders or an impatient board.

1344
01:41:55,026 --> 01:41:57,736
- The new president must be free to fall...  - Fail!

1345
01:41:57,945 --> 01:41:59,988
and learn to fail...  - Fall!

1346
01:42:00,198 --> 01:42:03,533
and rise again by applying what he has learned.

1347
01:42:03,743 --> 01:42:07,829
Such is business. Such is life.

1348
01:42:08,206 --> 01:42:13,126
Accordingly, I hereby bequeath all of my shares in Hudsucker Industry...

1349
01:42:13,336 --> 01:42:18,423
to whomever you and the board shall elect to succeed me as president.

1350
01:42:18,633 --> 01:42:20,342
I assume this will be you, Sidney.

1351
01:42:20,551 --> 01:42:25,514
If not, if the board should choose someone else to be president then, then..."

1352
01:42:25,723 --> 01:42:26,723
Tough titty toenails!

1353
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:30,811
That'll show the bastard!

1354
01:42:40,071 --> 01:42:41,196
Okay, go ahead.

1355
01:42:41,405 --> 01:42:43,615
"Then I urge you to work with the new president...

1356
01:42:43,825 --> 01:42:46,034
and remind him when he needs to be reminded...

1357
01:42:46,244 --> 01:42:48,537
that failure should never lead to despair.

1358
01:42:50,498 --> 01:42:53,375
Despair looks only to the past, in business...

1359
01:42:57,088 --> 01:42:58,380
and in love."

1360
01:42:58,589 --> 01:43:01,383
The future is now.

1361
01:43:01,592 --> 01:43:02,968
The future is now.

1362
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:07,139
"When our future president needs it...

1363
01:43:07,348 --> 01:43:11,643
Waring Hudsucker, hereby bequeaths him...

1364
01:43:11,853 --> 01:43:14,896
his second chance."

1365
01:43:34,625 --> 01:43:36,751
- Ha-ha-ha.  - Aah!

1366
01:43:45,970 --> 01:43:48,597
Deliver that letter in the morning!

1367
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:58,315
Ha, ha. Yoo-hoo! Yaa-haa!

1368
01:44:48,866 --> 01:44:53,995
And so began 1959. The New Year.

1369
01:44:54,205 --> 01:44:58,625
When he learned that Norville owned the company, Sidney was upset at first.

1370
01:44:59,210 --> 01:45:01,878
It's a good thing Doc Bronfenbrenner was there...

1371
01:45:02,088 --> 01:45:03,088
Sidney?

1372
01:45:03,297 --> 01:45:06,633
because he was able to keep Sidney from harming his old self.

1373
01:45:06,842 --> 01:45:10,762
He prescribed a long rest in the sana... In the sanator, uh...

1374
01:45:10,972 --> 01:45:13,181
In the booby hatch.

1375
01:45:13,391 --> 01:45:16,017
Now, Norville, heh...

1376
01:45:16,227 --> 01:45:19,354
he went on and ruled with wisdom and compassion...

1377
01:45:19,563 --> 01:45:23,191
and started dreaming up them exciting new ideas again.

1378
01:45:23,401 --> 01:45:24,776
You know, for kids.

1379
01:45:24,986 --> 01:45:27,779
I had the boys down at R&D throw together this prototype...

1380
01:45:27,989 --> 01:45:29,823
so our discussion could have focus...

1381
01:45:30,032 --> 01:45:32,826
and to give you gentlemen of the board a firsthand look.

1382
01:45:38,124 --> 01:45:42,419
That's the story of how Norville Barnes climbed way up...

1383
01:45:42,628 --> 01:45:46,047
to the 44th floor of the Hudsucker building...

1384
01:45:46,257 --> 01:45:51,011
and then fell all the way down, but didn't quite squish his self.

1385
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:55,515
You know, they say there was a man who jumped from the 45th floor.

1386
01:45:55,725 --> 01:45:57,475
But that's another story.
