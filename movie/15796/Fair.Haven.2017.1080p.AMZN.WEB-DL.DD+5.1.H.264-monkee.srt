1
00:00:01,417 --> 00:00:02,917
(glass breaking)

2
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:11,583
(gentle music)

3
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,000
(gentle music)

4
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,375
- [James] I'm better now.

5
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,458
I think it helped.

6
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,333
- [Richard] That's good.

7
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:57,000
- [James] Have
thing's been busy?

8
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,542
- [Richard] Things are
always busy, James.

9
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:07,625
- I was thinkin', I
could just rent a U-Haul

10
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:11,000
and drive myself to Boston.

11
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,458
That way you don't
have to leave the farm.

12
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,625
What do you think?

13
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,917
- We need to talk about
you going to college.

14
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:33,583
(dramatic music)

15
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:08,417
James.

16
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,834
- That was my money.

17
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,250
You had no right to use it.

18
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,500
- Sometimes life isn't fair.

19
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,625
We both know that.

20
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:17,959
There were hospital bills

21
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,583
and a funeral had
to be paid for.

22
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,333
Not to mention your treatment.

23
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:28,542
Look, I've been puttin' some
money away while you were gone.

24
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:30,500
So, if you can just help me
with the harvest next Fall,

25
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,917
then maybe you can go
to college in a year.

26
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:36,333
- I already deferred
my enrollment once

27
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,125
to give my spot
to somebody else.

28
00:04:43,834 --> 00:04:45,083
- I'm doin' my best, James.

29
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,208
Jesus.

30
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:06,291
(dramatic music)

31
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:11,834
- [Therapist] When
was the last time

32
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:15,000
you fantasized
sexually about men?

33
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,959
- About four months
ago, I guess.

34
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,208
- Nothing since then?

35
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,333
No dreams?

36
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:21,792
Daydreams?

37
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:22,625
- No.

38
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,125
- What about women?

39
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,583
- I think about women often.

40
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,458
- And what do you think
about while you masturbate?

41
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,500
- I don't masturbate.

42
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,166
- You looking forward
to going home?

43
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,333
- [James] No, I've had
a very nice time here.

44
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:48,750
- I'm not trying to trick you.

45
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:55,166
- I'm sure it'll be very nice.

46
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,291
- Have you spoken to
your father lately?

47
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,333
- He called on my birthday.

48
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,083
- Oh, how's he doin'?

49
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,959
- Seems fine.

50
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:14,250
- James, did your father
ever seek counseling

51
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,000
after your mother passed away?

52
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,667
He might not have
dealt with his grief.

53
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:20,458
- My father's a very strong man.

54
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,417
I don't think he'll need
therapy for anything.

55
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:27,417
- Sometimes even strong people
need someone to talk to.

56
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:31,250
I'm sure he'll be glad
to have you around

57
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,291
before you head off to...

58
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:38,291
Berklee College of Music

59
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,375
You must be looking
forward to that.

60
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,625
- Yeah, yes, very much.

61
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:44,208
- When you came here, you
said your greatest desire

62
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,083
is to become a concert pianist.

63
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,333
Is that still the case?

64
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,542
- Well, I'd still like to,

65
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:54,333
but it's not the most important
thing in my life anymore.

66
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,875
- [Therapist] What is now?

67
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:56,667
- God.

68
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:03,709
I'd like to settle down,
meet a girl, have a family.

69
00:07:05,417 --> 00:07:08,750
- Well, I'm sure you can still
fit music in there somewhere.

70
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:13,667
Being away from
home, you're going to

71
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,625
find yourself in a
lot of new situations.

72
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:21,583
There's gonna be a lot of
temptations out there for you.

73
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:21,709
- I know.

74
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,458
I'll be good.

75
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:31,333
- I'm sure you will.

76
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:35,583
Well, I think that
about does it.

77
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:40,166
Once more for the road then.

78
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:47,000
Our Father who art in heaven,

79
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,750
we ask you to bless James as
he goes forth from here today,

80
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,625
to watch over him as he
walks through temptation,

81
00:07:56,625 --> 00:08:01,291
guide him, help him,
deliver him from evil,

82
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:04,041
lead him on Your
path to salvation.

83
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,667
Help him to avoid
the sins of the flesh

84
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:11,834
and to embrace the
glory of Your light.

85
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:17,333
We ask these things in Your
name, O Lord, and pray.

86
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,041
Amen.

87
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,625
- [James] Amen.

88
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,417
(gentle music)

89
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:30,083
(music drowns out
dialogue on television)

90
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,875
(gentle music)

91
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:21,667
(gentle piano music)

92
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,959
(gentle piano music)

93
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:04,125
(birds chirping)

94
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,917
(dramatic music)

95
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,166
- God damn it!

96
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:23,500
- [James] You okay?

97
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,125
- Yeah, just stupid.

98
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:27,208
Watch that handle,
it's really hot.

99
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,083
- All right.

100
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:47,208
- You know, I've been thinking,

101
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,291
maybe taking a course
at the community college

102
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,583
wouldn't be a bad idea.

103
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,917
Give you a leg up.

104
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:54,750
- I don't know what
courses they have.

105
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,083
I don't know if Berklee
will accept them.

106
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,083
- Well, if I were you,
I wouldn't go to Boston.

107
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,000
I'd stay closer to home.

108
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,917
Vermont Tech's a good school.

109
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:13,291
- Yeah, Dad, I'm studying music.

110
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:15,792
- To what?

111
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:16,625
Be a teacher?

112
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,125
- Maybe, or play.

113
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,125
- Okay.

114
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:26,208
- [James] It's what I wanna do.

115
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,250
- Well, minor in it then.

116
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,250
Look, if I'm paying for this,

117
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,375
I want you to major in either
agriculture or business

118
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,667
or something like that.

119
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:37,250
- Well, then maybe
I oughta pay for it.

120
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,208
(chuckling)

121
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,125
- [Richard] How
you gonna do that?

122
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:39,750
- Find a job.

123
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,667
- [Richard] Doing what?

124
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:43,500
- Whatever I have to.

125
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,542
- Minimum wage is not gonna
pay your bills and school both.

126
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:50,375
- Damn it.

127
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,041
I'll figure it out.

128
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,375
- Why do you have to
make things so difficult?

129
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,625
I'm trying to do
what's best for you.

130
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,542
You know, one day you're
gonna inherit this place.

131
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:03,250
You're gonna have this
place all to yourself.

132
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,291
- Yeah, not anytime soon.

133
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,000
- Well, we can hope not.

134
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,083
But when you do, I want
you to be able to run it.

135
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:16,291
- When it's mine, I
intend to sell it.

136
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,333
- No, you will not
sell this farm.

137
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,333
This farm was your
grandfather's,

138
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:25,333
this farm was my grandfather's.

139
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,291
This place is home.

140
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,208
This place is a
roof over your head,

141
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:31,500
it's money in the
bank when you need it.

142
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,333
You don't understand that now.

143
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:37,333
You have no idea, but one
day you'll appreciate it.

144
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:46,417
Why can't you see
I'm just trying to do
what's best for you?

145
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:55,291
(dramatic music)

146
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,792
- I'll take a look
at those classes

147
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:15,500
at the community college, Dad.

148
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,542
- I'd appreciate it.

149
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:23,375
- Yeah.

150
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:45,875
(gentle music)

151
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,625
- [Richard] You can
just drive around back

152
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,041
to the loading dock,
and beep the horn,

153
00:15:57,041 --> 00:16:00,125
and somebody will
come give you a hand.

154
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,625
Make sure you get a receipt.

155
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,250
Can you handle that?

156
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,542
- [James] Yeah.

157
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:20,291
(engine starting)

158
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,166
(horn beeping)

159
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,500
(horn beeping)

160
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,417
- James?

161
00:17:04,542 --> 00:17:06,208
When did you get back?

162
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,333
- A few days ago.

163
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,333
- [Charlie] How are you?

164
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:21,709
- I'm fine.

165
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:24,333
- They got to you.

166
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,458
Didn't they?

167
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,875
- I need to drop these
off and get goin'.

168
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,583
We can't be friends
anymore, okay?

169
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,375
- Friends.

170
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:36,667
- Yeah, I can't be around you.

171
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,125
- I see.

172
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,750
- Things are different now.

173
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,834
I'm different.

174
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,542
- Sure you are.

175
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:00,542
- I gotta go.

176
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,333
(engine starting)

177
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:56,291
(dramatic music)

178
00:19:22,417 --> 00:19:25,834
- [Therapist] How are
you feeling right now?

179
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:26,250
- [James] Sad.

180
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,000
- [Therapist] Can
you expand on that?

181
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,250
Sad.

182
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,000
How?

183
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,083
Describe it.

184
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,834
- Alone.

185
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:38,083
I feel alone.

186
00:19:38,834 --> 00:19:40,375
Lonely.

187
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:45,291
- [Therapist] Do you
miss your mother?

188
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:49,959
- Yes.

189
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,333
- Your father?

190
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:55,500
What about your friends?

191
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,458
Were you close to them?

192
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,959
Did you have any
special friends?

193
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:13,125
- You mean like best friends?

194
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,375
- [Therapist] More
special than that.

195
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,250
You have a girlfriend?

196
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:21,875
- No.

197
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:25,709
- What about a boyfriend?

198
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:34,208
It's okay, you can tell me.

199
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:36,917
- Yes.

200
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:40,125
- [Therapist] How many?

201
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,000
- One.

202
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:47,458
- [Therapist] What was his name?

203
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,417
- Charlie.

204
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:56,333
- Were you intimate?

205
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,166
It's okay, you can tell me.

206
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,875
- Sometimes.

207
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,125
- [Therapist] How'd
that make you feel?

208
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:15,417
- I, I, I don't know.

209
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:16,500
Good, I guess.

210
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,417
- Sin makes us feel good while
we're committing it, James,

211
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:27,834
but that doesn't mean
it's good for us.

212
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:29,458
It can really mess us up inside.

213
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:36,667
And then when we're
done, feel bad about it.

214
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:37,458
Does that make sense?

215
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:41,750
- Yes.

216
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:47,291
- [Therapist] Charlie
is like a drug.

217
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,875
It's hard being away
from him right now.

218
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,458
I know, but, being with
him would be worse.

219
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,291
Once he's out of your
system I promise you,

220
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:02,291
you're going to
feel so much better,

221
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,291
and then you're gonna wonder

222
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:06,208
why you ever had
him in your life.

223
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,834
(dramatic music)

224
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,542
- Did you get that receipt?

225
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:39,750
Well?

226
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:42,750
- Hey, Dad, can you take care of

227
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,500
those deliveries from now on?

228
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,917
- [Richard] Why?

229
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,875
I give you one simple job,
you can't even do that?

230
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,750
- Forget it.

231
00:23:13,709 --> 00:23:16,458
(horn blaring)

232
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,375
I need the receipts.

233
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:28,709
- What?

234
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:30,583
- I need the receipts
for the apples.

235
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:41,500
Damn it.

236
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,125
All right, let's
hurry it up, please.

237
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:56,709
- What did they do to you?

238
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,959
- Don't worry about it.

239
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:06,333
- Are you happier?

240
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:14,000
Well, you seem happier.

241
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,750
(dramatic music)

242
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:20,375
Maybe I should sign
up for a round.

243
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,583
It did wonders for you.

244
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:23,583
(grunts)

245
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:27,792
(dramatic music)

246
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:47,333
- I wanna go to church.

247
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:49,125
- What now?

248
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:50,500
- No, Sunday.

249
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,166
That all right?

250
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:52,583
- Yeah, I guess.

251
00:24:57,458 --> 00:25:00,625
- When you were slaves of sin,

252
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:03,667
you are free in regard
to righteousness.

253
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:04,667
So what fruit did you then get

254
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:08,667
from the things of
which are now ashamed?

255
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:11,583
The end of those
things is death.

256
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:14,625
But now that you have
been freed from sin,

257
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:15,875
and enslaved to God,

258
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:19,250
the fruit that you
get is eternal life.

259
00:25:20,917 --> 00:25:22,959
For the wages of sin is death,

260
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:26,542
and the gift of God
is eternal life.

261
00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:27,792
In Jesus Christ our Lord.

262
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:34,458
(church music)

263
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:35,834
Thank you.

264
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:36,625
Thank you.

265
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:38,375
All right, thank you.

266
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:39,834
- [Boy] Nice sermon, Pastor.

267
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:42,500
- [Pastor] Thank you, Lucy.

268
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,458
Richard, James, so great
to have you back with us.

269
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:47,750
How have you been holding up?

270
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,000
- Ah, we're doing all right.

271
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,834
- Well, that's good to hear.

272
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:51,709
How old are you now?

273
00:25:51,709 --> 00:25:52,542
- 19.

274
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:53,375
19, well my Suzy just turned 19.

275
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:55,709
She's going to UVM in the Fall.

276
00:25:55,709 --> 00:25:56,667
- That's a good school.

277
00:25:56,667 --> 00:25:59,625
James is thinking
about Vermont Tech.

278
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:02,667
Maybe Suzy could
give him some advice.

279
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:04,041
- I'm sure she would love that.

280
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:04,875
Hang on.

281
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:07,291
Suzy, could you
come here, honey.

282
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:08,875
Suzy, you remember James?

283
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:13,125
- Yeah, not well, we were
a year apart in school.

284
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:14,208
- Well, he's going to
college in the Fall,

285
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:16,625
and maybe you can help
him with his application.

286
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:18,041
- Yeah, I would love to.

287
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:20,208
Let me give you my number.

288
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:22,000

289
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:26,917
Yeah, sure.

Well, I'd like to
go somewhere else.

334
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:19,166
- Well, where do you wanna go?

335
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:20,000
- Well, I was accepted into

336
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,583
Berklee College of
Music in Boston.

337
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:24,291
- Wow.

338
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:24,917
Congratulations.

339
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:27,959
- Thank you.

340
00:29:31,542 --> 00:29:34,375
My Dad says it's not
practical though.

341
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:36,208
- Oh, I see.

342
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:38,375
- [James] Yeah.

343
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:39,834
- And he's probably
just tryin' to do

344
00:29:39,834 --> 00:29:42,208
what he thinks is best for ya.

345
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:47,458
- [James] You're engaged?

346
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,834
- No.

347
00:29:49,834 --> 00:29:51,458
It's a promise ring.

348
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,750
- What is that?

349
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:58,625
- [Suzy] It means I've
promised to stay a virgin

350
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:00,417
until I'm married.

351
00:30:00,417 --> 00:30:02,417
(chuckles)

352
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:03,208
It's silly, it's okay.

353
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:03,875
- No, no.

354
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:05,875
I don't think so.

355
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:06,709
- Oh.

356
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:14,166
(gentle music)

357
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:17,125
- Well, you know, I should,

358
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:18,458
I should keep going.

359
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:20,083
I have a lot of deliveries
and stuff to do, so...

360
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:21,250
- Okay.

361
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:21,625
Well, I'm sorry I
wasn't very much help.

362
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:23,125
- No, no.

363
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:23,834
No, don't worry about it.

364
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:25,083
I'll figure it out.

365
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:26,291
- And if you have anymore
questions, you have my number.

366
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,417
- Yeah, yeah.

367
00:30:27,417 --> 00:30:28,625
- Of if you just wanna hang out.

368
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:31,333
I mean, that would be fun too.

369
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:33,333
- Hang out?

370
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,917
- Yeah.

371
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:39,208
We could grab some dinner or
see a movie or something fun.

372
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,333
- Sure.

373
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:46,333
- I mean we don't have
to if you don't want to.
- No, no no. We, we.

374
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:47,875
Yeah, yeah.

375
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:49,667
I need to to check my
schedule, you know,

376
00:30:49,667 --> 00:30:50,458
but I'll give you a call.

377
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:51,375
- Okay.

378
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:51,750
- Yeah, all right.

379
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,041
- Okay.

380
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:54,583
- Bye.

381
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:58,166
(gentle music)

382
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:01,750
(horn blaring)

383
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:09,583
- Be right back
with your receipts.

384
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:11,417
- Hey.

385
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:17,083
Sorry for how I
acted the other day.

386
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,333
- You should be.

387
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,166
I don't agree with this.

388
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:35,583
But if you're gonna be
coming by here a lot,

389
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:37,917
we can at least be civil.

390
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:41,250
- Yeah.

391
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:53,041
(dramatic music)

392
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:03,333
- [Therapist] Did your
father ever hit you?

393
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:04,166
- No.

394
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:08,542
Why are we doing this?

395
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,166
- I'm trying to establish

396
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:16,959
if there's been any emotional
trauma in your life.

397
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:19,083
Something that happened
a long time ago

398
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:21,959
that you may have
forgotten about.

399
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:24,417
- I don't think so.

400
00:32:24,417 --> 00:32:25,041
I think I'd remember it.

401
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:26,250
- No, not necessarily.

402
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:30,792
We often repress difficult
or painful memories.

403
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:34,250
If something like
that did happen,

404
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:37,917
if you were abused or
mistreated, for instance,

405
00:32:37,917 --> 00:32:41,625
that could help explain
your situation now.

406
00:32:42,709 --> 00:32:44,417
And if that's the case,

407
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:45,583
working on that might help you

408
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:50,417
to transition back to
healthy, heterosexual desires.

409
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,208
- Like I'd be
interested in girls?

410
00:32:57,583 --> 00:33:00,250
- I believe you
already are deep down.

411
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,792
That's what nature
intended you to be.

412
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:06,208
Something just knocked you
off course along the way.

413
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:08,625
- I mean, I wasn't abused or
molested or anything like that.

414
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:10,959
- Okay, that's great.

415
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:13,291
We'll look for another
explanation then.

416
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:16,792
You and I can work on
finding that together.

417
00:33:16,792 --> 00:33:18,542
I wanna help you, James,

418
00:33:18,542 --> 00:33:20,667
but you have to want it too.

419
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:27,625
- I do.

420
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:29,500
- Good.

421
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,166
Won't be easy.

422
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:31,500
You have to work at it.

423
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,834
You're gonna have to
push yourself toward
healthy behavior,

424
00:33:33,834 --> 00:33:36,709
try to avoid temptation.

425
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:38,417
Everyone is different.

426
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:39,625
You have have tremendous success

427
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:43,083
and walk out of here a totally
heterosexual young man,

428
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:46,834
or you may always struggle
with your feelings.

429
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:50,291
(dramatic music)

430
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:14,834
(gentle music)

431
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:37,709
- Hello.

432
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:39,667
Hi, it's James.

433
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:41,375
How are you?

434
00:34:41,375 --> 00:34:43,542
Good, good good, I'm good.

435
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:50,083
Yeah, listen, I was thinking
about what you said,

436
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:51,417
and I was wondering if maybe

437
00:34:51,417 --> 00:34:53,333
you wanted to grab
dinner tonight.

438
00:34:55,834 --> 00:34:57,208
Yeah, yeah sure.

439
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:00,917
All right, sure.

440
00:35:00,917 --> 00:35:03,417
Sure, so six o'clock.

441
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:04,417
Yeah, all right, great.

442
00:35:04,417 --> 00:35:06,417
Great, I'll see you then.

443
00:35:06,417 --> 00:35:07,291
Okay.

444
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:09,000
All right, bye.

445
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,750
(gentle music)

446
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:17,625
(knocking)

447
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:18,834
Yeah?

448
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:20,875
- I was headin' into town.

449
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:22,792
I just wondered if you
needed some supplies.

450
00:35:22,792 --> 00:35:23,917
- No, no no, I'm fine.

451
00:35:23,917 --> 00:35:26,583
- You gotta buy books, don't ya?

452
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,750
- Yeah, I won't know
until class starts.

453
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,875
- Well here.

454
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:32,333
If you need more, let me know.

455
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:33,166
- [James] Okay.

456
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:35,000
- Are you goin' somewhere?

457
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,959
- Yeah, I was going to
grab dinner with Suzy.

458
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:39,625
- Ah, where you goin'?

459
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:40,458
- Oh...

460
00:35:42,792 --> 00:35:44,125
I don't know.

461
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:45,250
- Just take her to Ruby's.

462
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,417
Oh, I know it doesn't
look like much,

463
00:35:47,417 --> 00:35:49,917
but the food's
really good, honest.

464
00:35:49,917 --> 00:35:51,083
Here, my treat.

465
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,458
Have a big time.

466
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:59,834
- Thanks.

467
00:35:59,834 --> 00:36:02,625
(dramatic music)

468
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,333
(country music)

469
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,583
We can go somewhere else.

470
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:45,083
- No.

471
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:46,667
No, this is fine, and
there's lots of personality.

472
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:48,500
- You sure?

473
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,834
- [Suzy] Absolutely.

474
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:50,834
- You kids want an appetizer?

475
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,458
- What do you have?

476
00:36:52,458 --> 00:36:54,792
- Chips, pretzels, peanuts.

477
00:36:55,542 --> 00:36:57,250
- I think we're okay for now.

478
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,458
- [Waitress] All right.

479
00:36:58,458 --> 00:36:59,166
Let me know when
you're ready to order.

480
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:00,250
- Thank you.

481
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:07,041
I'm sorry.

482
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:08,583
- Don't be.

483
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:10,041
My Dad was always saying
this place is a pit of sins,

484
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:12,417
so I've been dying to see why.

485
00:37:13,917 --> 00:37:14,375
(laughs)

486
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:15,542
I'm kidding.

487
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:16,333
It's fine, it's fine.

488
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,834
In fact, I wish we would
have done this sooner.

489
00:37:23,834 --> 00:37:24,834
- Oh yeah?

490
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:26,417
- Yeah.

491
00:37:26,417 --> 00:37:28,917
I wish we would have known
each other in high school.

492
00:37:28,917 --> 00:37:29,709
- Yeah.

493
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:34,291
- Just running in
different crowds I guess.

494
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:37,583
You were always with Brad
Miller and Charlie Green.

495
00:37:39,709 --> 00:37:43,166
Is it true what they
said about Charlie?

496
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:46,041
- What did they say?

497
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:47,291
- He's gay.

498
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:52,583
- I don't think I should
reveal the details

499
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:53,875
of other people's...

500
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:55,500
(gasping)

501
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,792
- That's crazy.

502
00:37:58,291 --> 00:37:59,125
Wow.

503
00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:02,959
- Does it bother you?

504
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:05,458
- I think people
ought to be free

505
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:08,375
to live their lives
however they like.

506
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:16,500
Well, thanks again.

507
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,291
- Yeah.

508
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:19,208
It was a really good time.

509
00:38:19,208 --> 00:38:20,750
- I guess I'll see you around.

510
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:21,583
- Yeah.

511
00:38:28,125 --> 00:38:29,250
- Um...

512
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:31,125
- Oh.

513
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:32,750
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

514
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,542
- No, I'm sorry.

515
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:34,792
- No no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

516
00:38:34,792 --> 00:38:35,417
I...

517
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:35,959
- I should get inside.

518
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:37,709
- No, no, no, no.

519
00:38:37,709 --> 00:38:38,500
Listen, listen.

520
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,291
I um...

521
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:44,291
I like to take things
slower, you know.

522
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:47,625
I think slow is better for me.

523
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:48,417
- [Suzy] Okay.

524
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:49,250
- Yeah.

525
00:38:51,792 --> 00:38:55,041
But look, I'd like
for this to be a...

526
00:38:57,166 --> 00:38:59,333
You know, if you want.

527
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:00,959
- Yeah, sure, if you do.

528
00:39:00,959 --> 00:39:02,375
- Yeah, yeah, I do.

529
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:07,000
- Okay, well, I
should get inside.

530
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,333
Bye.

531
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:08,500
- Yeah.

532
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:22,291
(dramatic music)

533
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:53,291
- You're still dreaming
about girls sexually?

534
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:00,458
Does anyone know
why we have dreams?

535
00:40:01,709 --> 00:40:04,542
Dreams are our brain's way
of making sense of the things

536
00:40:04,542 --> 00:40:08,250
that we experience
during the day.

537
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:12,917
So, if, for instance, we
see a dog when we're awake,

538
00:40:12,917 --> 00:40:14,458
and we think about that dog,

539
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:16,875
we might dream about it at night

540
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:20,000
when our brain is sorting
out those memories.

541
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,250
Does that make sense?

542
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:25,208
So, if you're having sexual
dreams about women at night,

543
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:27,709
it's probably because

544
00:40:27,709 --> 00:40:30,166
you're thinking about them
sexually during the day.

545
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:31,917
- But I wasn't.

546
00:40:31,917 --> 00:40:33,375
- It's okay, it's okay.

547
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:35,750
Everyone slips up
from time to time.

548
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,750
You just have to focus
and try your best

549
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:41,458
to stay away from
thoughts and situations

550
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:43,417
that will lead you
down the wrong path.

551
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:44,959
Remember, your body wants you

552
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:47,917
to be attracted to
the opposite sex.

553
00:40:49,709 --> 00:40:50,834
- Why is that?

554
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:56,542
- Because that's
what God intended.

555
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:00,750
- I'm not sure I believe in God.

556
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:05,625
- Well, that's okay, James.

557
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:07,125
He believes in you.

558
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:11,000
God made Adam and Eve.

559
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:12,625
One man and one woman,

560
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:15,834
because that's what's
required to have a baby.

561
00:41:15,834 --> 00:41:18,041
Not two men, not two women,

562
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:20,291
not three people
of various genders.

563
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:21,583
One and one.

564
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:23,083
And that's not just
true with people.

565
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:24,750
It's also true in
the animal kingdom.

566
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:27,000
One male lion and
one female lion

567
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,458
can make a baby lion.

568
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:30,667
One male zebra and
one female zebra

569
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:31,542
can make a baby zebra.

570
00:41:31,542 --> 00:41:32,625
One male shark...

571
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:33,375
- All right.

572
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:33,959
I get it.

573
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:34,917
- It's in your genes.

574
00:41:34,917 --> 00:41:37,750
Your body wants you
to be with a woman

575
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,625
so that you can make babies
and carry on the species.

576
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:43,291
- [Woman] I don't
think I want babies.

577
00:41:43,291 --> 00:41:45,667
- Well, maybe not right now,

578
00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:49,875
but one day you will,
when you're ready.

579
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:51,667
And you won't be
able to have them

580
00:41:51,667 --> 00:41:53,667
with another woman.

581
00:41:53,667 --> 00:41:56,083
(gentle music)

582
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:11,667
(music drowns out dialogue)

583
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:13,875
- [Richard] You know,
it's just not for sale.

584
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:17,709
It's been in the
family for generations.

585
00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:19,375
- [Customer] Okay,
we were, you know

586
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:20,333
interested in kind of
taking your orchard

587
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:23,291
in a different direction.

588
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:24,125
- [Woman] A lot of
people in our area

589
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,792
are starting to
buy more organic.

590
00:42:25,792 --> 00:42:27,458
- [Male Customer] Yeah.
- [Woman] That's the direction
they seem to be goin'.

591
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:30,208
- That's true.
A lot of the grocery
stores, you know,

592
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:31,083
they really got a lot
of interest in it,

593
00:42:31,083 --> 00:42:32,583
and I think they're
paying a premium

594
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:33,709
for organic apples and...

595
00:42:33,709 --> 00:42:35,625
- [Richard] Well,
good luck with that,

596
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:37,583
but the place ain't for sale.

597
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:38,834
- Okay.

598
00:42:38,834 --> 00:42:41,208
Well, it's a shame, you've
got a beautiful property here.

599
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:43,041
- There's nothing we can
do to change your mind?

600
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:46,542
- [Richard] No,
I don't think so.

601
00:42:46,542 --> 00:42:47,625
- Okay then.

602
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,625
Let me give you my card,

603
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:55,333
and if you change your
mind give us a call.

604
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:56,750
- [Richard] You don't need
to waste one of your cards.

605
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:57,542
- No, please.

606
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:58,834
Keep it.

607
00:42:58,834 --> 00:43:00,166
- [Woman] Thank
you for your time.

608
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:00,959
- [Richard] All right,
well, good luck.

609
00:43:00,959 --> 00:43:01,792
- [Woman] Thank you.

610
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:03,750
- [Male Customer] Thank you.

611
00:43:17,792 --> 00:43:18,500
- Hey.

612
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:18,834
- [Richard] Hey.

613
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:21,875
- Who were those people?

614
00:43:21,875 --> 00:43:23,834
- [Richard] Couple of weirdos.

615
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:24,834
- Oh yeah?

616
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:26,917
- [Richard] Yeah.

617
00:43:26,917 --> 00:43:28,875
- What'd they want?

618
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:32,041
- [Richard] They
wanted to buy the farm.

619
00:43:33,709 --> 00:43:36,333
- Great, well, what
did you tell them?

620
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:38,834
- [Richard] What do
you think I told them?

621
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:43,792
- Say what they
wanted to do with it?

622
00:43:43,792 --> 00:43:48,166
- They wanna modernize
it, go organic.

623
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:50,250
I told them the apples
are already organic.

624
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:53,291
They come right
out of the ground.

625
00:43:53,291 --> 00:43:56,000
- I think they meant they
wanna use less pesticides, Dad.

626
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,959
- [Richard] Well, they're
not very good farmers then,

627
00:43:57,959 --> 00:43:59,875
are they?

628
00:43:59,875 --> 00:44:01,458
- A lot of people are
startin' to think like them.

629
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:03,917
- It's a fad, it'll pass.

630
00:44:03,917 --> 00:44:04,834
- I'm just sayin' we
oughta look into it.

631
00:44:04,834 --> 00:44:06,083
That's all.

632
00:44:06,083 --> 00:44:07,792
- James, I appreciate
you wanting to help,

633
00:44:07,792 --> 00:44:08,750
but trust me when I say I know

634
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,792
what the hell I'm doin', okay?

635
00:44:11,792 --> 00:44:13,417
Now, when you're
runnin' the show,

636
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:15,458
you can grow apples
anyway you want.

637
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:16,792
Maybe then you'll
find out your old man

638
00:44:16,792 --> 00:44:19,333
knew what he was talkin' about.

639
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:23,417
You still in your pajamas?

640
00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:29,792
(dramatic music)

641
00:45:03,959 --> 00:45:06,667
(horn beeping)

642
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:40,250
- Sorry, I'm running
behind today.

643
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:43,542
- [James] What happened to you?

644
00:45:43,542 --> 00:45:44,375
- I ran into a door.

645
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:45,208
- Charlie.

646
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:52,709
- A couple of guys
jumped me after work.

647
00:45:55,166 --> 00:45:55,500
- Here?

648
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,125
- No.

649
00:45:57,125 --> 00:45:58,667
Down the road.

650
00:45:58,667 --> 00:46:00,041
I've been walking home
since my car died.

651
00:46:00,041 --> 00:46:01,166
- No, you can't walk all the way

652
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:02,834
back to your place form here.

653
00:46:02,834 --> 00:46:04,166
- Look, it won't
happen again, okay.

654
00:46:04,166 --> 00:46:05,250
I got my guard up this time.

655
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:06,333
- You're not walking anymore.

656
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:07,417
Let me drive you.

657
00:46:07,417 --> 00:46:08,208
- James, I don't need an escort.

658
00:46:08,208 --> 00:46:09,667
- I don't care.

659
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:10,917
What time is your shift over?

660
00:46:10,917 --> 00:46:11,709
- James.

661
00:46:11,709 --> 00:46:14,083
- What time is your shift over?

662
00:46:17,125 --> 00:46:18,166
- Nine.

663
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:19,125
- Okay.

664
00:46:19,125 --> 00:46:19,917
I'll see you at nine.

665
00:46:35,208 --> 00:46:38,208
(laughing)

666
00:46:38,208 --> 00:46:40,083
- [Richard] Here he comes.

667
00:46:47,709 --> 00:46:48,542
- Hi.

668
00:46:49,208 --> 00:46:50,041
- Hey.

669
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:54,291
What's goin' on?

670
00:46:54,291 --> 00:46:54,792
- Just wanted to drop
by and surprise ya.

671
00:46:54,792 --> 00:46:57,208
Hope that's okay.

672
00:46:57,208 --> 00:46:58,250
- Ah yeah.

673
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,125
Sure.

674
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:01,000
- Well, it was
nice talkin' to ya.

675
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
- Yeah, you too.

676
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:08,291
So, my parents wanted me to
invite you to dinner tonight.

677
00:47:08,291 --> 00:47:09,125
- Oh.

678
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,291
You know, my Dad,
actually, is gonna be

679
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:16,750
be cooking dinner tonight.

680
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,792
- [Suzy] Oh.

681
00:47:17,792 --> 00:47:18,667
Well, I just told
him I was gonna

682
00:47:18,667 --> 00:47:20,000
invite you to dinner with us,

683
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,583
and he said he didn't
mind eating alone.

684
00:47:22,583 --> 00:47:24,250
- Oh.

685
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,333
- If you don't wanna
come, that's...

686
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:25,792
- No, no, no.

687
00:47:25,792 --> 00:47:27,166
I do, I do.

688
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:27,917
- Okay.

689
00:47:27,917 --> 00:47:29,000
- What time?

690
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,291
- 7:30.

691
00:47:30,291 --> 00:47:30,625
- Okay.

692
00:47:30,625 --> 00:47:31,417
- Great.

693
00:47:31,417 --> 00:47:33,250
- Yeah.

694
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:33,959
- [Suzie] I'll see you then.

695
00:47:33,959 --> 00:47:34,667
- [James] All right.

696
00:47:34,667 --> 00:47:35,000
- [Suzie] Bye.

697
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:51,208
- Steak.

698
00:47:53,041 --> 00:47:55,500
You're gettin' pretty
handy with the oven.

699
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:55,834
- Actually, it's not bad.

700
00:47:55,834 --> 00:47:57,375
- Yeah?

701
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:58,333
- Hey, you look nice.

702
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,208
- Thanks.

703
00:48:00,208 --> 00:48:01,458
- You can tell your girlfriend

704
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:02,625
come on over for dinner
over here next time.

705
00:48:02,625 --> 00:48:03,583
- You can keep practicing.

706
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,375
I don't wanna poison her.

707
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,166
- Hey.

708
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:12,083
Your mom would be proud of ya.

709
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:17,500
(dramatic music)

710
00:48:18,417 --> 00:48:19,917
Have a good time.

711
00:48:21,667 --> 00:48:24,291
(door creaking)

712
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,959
(dramatic music)

713
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,792
- How are things
are the farm, James?

714
00:48:38,792 --> 00:48:39,709
We drive by there almost
everyday, don't we?

715
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:40,834
- [Mother] All time time.

716
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:43,166
- Yeah, it's gorgeous.

717
00:48:43,166 --> 00:48:44,166
- [Mother] It is.

718
00:48:44,166 --> 00:48:45,000
- So nice.

719
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:49,542
So what is it like
working at an apple farm?

720
00:48:50,083 --> 00:48:52,250
- It's fine I guess.

721
00:48:59,291 --> 00:48:59,750
A lot of work.

722
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:02,083
- I'll bet.

723
00:49:02,083 --> 00:49:04,750
How long's it been
in your family now?

724
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:05,834
- Long time.

725
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,542
- Isn't that something.

726
00:49:08,542 --> 00:49:10,375
- That's incredible.

727
00:49:10,375 --> 00:49:11,583
- All right.

728
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:12,667
It's only Fair Haven
apples for us from now on.

729
00:49:12,667 --> 00:49:14,083
(laughing)

730
00:49:17,625 --> 00:49:19,583
- And Suzy tells us that
you play music as well.

731
00:49:19,583 --> 00:49:21,542
- Yes, yes, I do piano.

732
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:22,625
- Oh that's lovely.

733
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:24,834
You'll have to play
something for us sometime.

734
00:49:24,834 --> 00:49:25,959
- Oh, gladly.

735
00:49:25,959 --> 00:49:27,792
Do you have a piano?

736
00:49:27,792 --> 00:49:29,083
- No, we don't.

737
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:30,834
- Oh.

738
00:49:31,875 --> 00:49:34,083
- James is gonna take
over the farm someday.

739
00:49:34,083 --> 00:49:35,458
- Oh.

740
00:49:35,458 --> 00:49:36,583
- Well, that's great.

741
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:37,458
That's very admirable.

742
00:49:37,458 --> 00:49:40,125
Keeping the family
business going.

743
00:49:40,125 --> 00:49:41,375
A lot of kids these days,

744
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,834
they want nothing to
do with tradition,

745
00:49:42,834 --> 00:49:45,917
and soon as they graduate
school, pow, they're gone.

746
00:49:45,917 --> 00:49:47,250
- [Mother] It's so true.

747
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,208
- [Father] But it's
good to hear you'll be

748
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:49,959
staying in area long term.

749
00:49:49,959 --> 00:49:52,625
I mean, you know, we wouldn't
want you whisking our daughter
off to God knows where.

750
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:53,750
- [Suzy] Dad!
- (laughing)

751
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:55,125
- [Mother] Oh, stop it.
You're gonna scare him.

752
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:56,417
- [Father] Oh, come on,
I'm kidding.

753
00:49:56,417 --> 00:49:58,000
He knows I'm joking,
right, James?

754
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:58,834
- Yes, sir.

755
00:49:58,834 --> 00:49:59,792
- [Father] I mean, come on.

756
00:49:59,792 --> 00:50:00,625
It's not like I
mention their children.

757
00:50:00,625 --> 00:50:04,250
(laughing)

758
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:06,000
What do ya feel
about children, huh?

759
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,333
Do you want some someday?

760
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:11,333
- Is that clock right?

761
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,291
- Yes.

762
00:50:13,917 --> 00:50:15,625
- Sorry, I have to run.

763
00:50:15,625 --> 00:50:16,792
Dinner was wonderful.

764
00:50:16,792 --> 00:50:19,625
Thank you so much
for everything.

765
00:50:20,709 --> 00:50:21,500
- James.

766
00:50:24,166 --> 00:50:24,709
James.

767
00:50:24,709 --> 00:50:25,750
Is everything okay?

768
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:28,625
- Yeah, everything's fine.

769
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:29,750
- Are you sure?

770
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:30,917
- Yeah, I just forgot I have
something to do at nine.

771
00:50:30,917 --> 00:50:32,750
- My Dad was just joking around.

772
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:35,542
- Oh, no, it's fine.

773
00:50:35,542 --> 00:50:36,667
I gotta run.

774
00:51:06,875 --> 00:51:07,709
- Hey.

775
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:16,792
- [James] How bad is it?

776
00:51:16,792 --> 00:51:18,208
- [Charlie] Not bad.

777
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,959
- Maybe you should
start carrying mace.

778
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:23,709
- I just need to get
out of this town.

779
00:51:23,709 --> 00:51:25,917
- You still thinking
of joining the circus?

780
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:26,834
- That was a good idea.

781
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:29,875
- [James] No, it wasn't.

782
00:51:29,875 --> 00:51:30,583
- I could have been the
most famous sword swallower

783
00:51:30,583 --> 00:51:32,333
in all of America at this point.

784
00:51:32,333 --> 00:51:33,542
- Oh yeah?

785
00:51:33,542 --> 00:51:35,000
Why don't you then?

786
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:41,375
- Because you
wouldn't come with me.

787
00:51:55,792 --> 00:51:57,750
- [James] Here, here.

788
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:58,583
I got it.

789
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:01,542
- Thanks.

790
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:05,875
- Sure.

791
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:10,083
- [Charlie] See you tomorrow?

792
00:52:23,291 --> 00:52:26,041
(dramatic music)

793
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,542
- [Therapist] What you felt
for your boyfriend wasn't love.

794
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,417
It was lust.

795
00:53:35,208 --> 00:53:36,667
- You don't know that.

796
00:53:36,667 --> 00:53:39,041
- Love is different.

797
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:41,041
Think about your
parents, right now.

798
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:41,917
Your mothers and your fathers.

799
00:53:41,917 --> 00:53:45,000
Think about how
they make you feel.

800
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,208
That's love.

801
00:53:46,208 --> 00:53:48,041
Now, think about
someone of the same sex

802
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:49,333
that you're attracted to.

803
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:55,041
- It feels similar.

804
00:53:55,041 --> 00:53:58,542
- Sometimes we remember things
the way we prefer them to be,

805
00:53:58,542 --> 00:54:00,041
not the way they actually were.

806
00:54:00,041 --> 00:54:02,041
The way you described
your relationship,

807
00:54:02,041 --> 00:54:04,041
when you and your
boyfriend were together,

808
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:06,125
you can hardly keep
your clothes on.

809
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:08,125
That's not true love.

810
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:10,208
There's nothing pure or
beautiful about that.

811
00:54:10,208 --> 00:54:11,041
It's lust.

812
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:14,083
It's pleasures of the flesh.

813
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:16,208
If you were to run into your
boyfriend again right now,

814
00:54:16,208 --> 00:54:18,667
you'd probably yearn
to be with him.

815
00:54:18,667 --> 00:54:22,375
You'd want him to touch you,
to hug you, to kiss you,

816
00:54:22,375 --> 00:54:25,583
but that's the
devil's influence.

817
00:54:25,583 --> 00:54:27,333
Sin is very attractive.

818
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:29,917
You have to fight against it.

819
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:33,333
- It's different with girls?

820
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:35,542
- Sometimes.

821
00:54:35,542 --> 00:54:38,250
Sure, you can lust after girls,

822
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,500
but you can also fall
in love with one.

823
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:43,250
And believe me, that's
worth waiting for.

824
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:46,083
You can't fall in
love with a man.

825
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:46,417
It's impossible.

826
00:54:49,041 --> 00:54:50,375
- How do you know?

827
00:54:53,583 --> 00:54:55,250
- My Father told me.

828
00:54:57,083 --> 00:54:58,041
Right here.

829
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:04,208
You follow this, and
you'll know the difference.

830
00:55:06,875 --> 00:55:09,583
(dramatic music)

831
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:55,250
- Oh fuck!

832
00:55:56,166 --> 00:55:57,417
God damn it.

833
00:55:57,417 --> 00:55:58,333
- Havin' trouble?

834
00:55:58,333 --> 00:55:59,959
- What the hell's it look like?

835
00:55:59,959 --> 00:56:00,834
- [James] What's goin' on?

836
00:56:00,834 --> 00:56:02,667
You all right over there?

837
00:56:04,083 --> 00:56:07,834
- Those yuppies came
back again this morning.

838
00:56:07,834 --> 00:56:09,166
- [James] Who?

839
00:56:09,166 --> 00:56:12,166
- The ones trying
to buy the place.

840
00:56:12,166 --> 00:56:13,333
- I thought you told them no.

841
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:14,417
- I did.

842
00:56:15,542 --> 00:56:16,291
They thought maybe
I'd change my mind,

843
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:19,083
they gave me a better offer.

844
00:56:19,083 --> 00:56:20,291
- How much?

845
00:56:20,291 --> 00:56:21,625
- [Richard] Doesn't matter.

846
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:22,625
- Just curious.

847
00:56:22,625 --> 00:56:23,583
- Not enough.

848
00:56:24,875 --> 00:56:26,375
Place is worth more than money.

849
00:56:26,375 --> 00:56:27,875
- Yeah, but how much money?

850
00:56:27,875 --> 00:56:28,667
- 750.

851
00:56:33,875 --> 00:56:34,500
- 750,000 dollars?

852
00:56:36,291 --> 00:56:38,083
- [Richard] Uh-huh.

853
00:56:38,709 --> 00:56:40,500
- Dad, why'd you say no?

854
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,333
- I told you.

855
00:56:41,333 --> 00:56:42,542
- No, no no.

856
00:56:42,542 --> 00:56:43,500
With that kind of money, we
could do whatever we wanted.

857
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,041
You could retire.

858
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:46,000
- [Richard] I told you
I'm not selling the place!

859
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,625
- I could go to
school for God's sake,

860
00:56:46,625 --> 00:56:48,375
with that kind of cash.

861
00:56:48,375 --> 00:56:49,458
- James, I'm not gonna
discuss anymore, all right.

862
00:56:49,458 --> 00:56:50,583
You got chores to do, go do 'em.

863
00:56:54,625 --> 00:56:55,458
Now.

864
00:56:57,875 --> 00:56:58,667
Jesus.

865
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:02,291
Come on, you son of a bitch.

866
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:09,375
(piano music)

867
00:58:04,667 --> 00:58:08,625
Play that one your
mom used to play.

868
00:58:08,625 --> 00:58:11,291
You know the one I like, that...

869
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:12,625
(humming)

870
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:19,041
(sobbing)

871
00:58:21,458 --> 00:58:25,500
I would like to
hear that one again.

872
00:58:27,959 --> 00:58:29,709
(somber music)

873
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:36,625
Please.

874
00:58:42,834 --> 00:58:44,792
- [James] He won't even
consider what I want.

875
00:58:44,792 --> 00:58:48,458
All he cares about is
his stupid family legacy.

876
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:51,417
- [Charlie] It's
your family too.

877
00:58:51,417 --> 00:58:52,250
- [James] I don't care about it.

878
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:54,458
I want my own life.

879
00:58:54,458 --> 00:58:57,709
With that kind of money,
I could do anything.

880
00:58:59,083 --> 00:59:02,917
- I guess there's only
one thing left to do.

881
00:59:02,917 --> 00:59:04,709
We'll have to kill him.

882
00:59:07,208 --> 00:59:08,250
- That's not funny.

883
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:10,083
- It was a little funny.

884
00:59:10,083 --> 00:59:10,750
- No, it wasn't.

885
00:59:12,709 --> 00:59:13,709
- Seriously though.

886
00:59:13,709 --> 00:59:15,000
I don't think you
should let your Dad

887
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,667
choose what you wanna
do with your life.

888
00:59:17,667 --> 00:59:18,166
- What other choice do I have?

889
00:59:18,166 --> 00:59:20,208
- Tons.

890
00:59:20,208 --> 00:59:21,166
You have nothing but choices.

891
00:59:21,166 --> 00:59:22,959
What, so he won't
make it easy for you?

892
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:23,750
Big deal.

893
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:25,041
Move out and do it on your own.

894
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:25,792
- It's too hard.

895
00:59:25,792 --> 00:59:27,375
- Oh, boo hoo, it's too hard.

896
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:30,166
So life's rough for a few years.

897
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:31,709
Then you'll be great.

898
00:59:31,709 --> 00:59:34,125
Or you could just sit
here, do what you're told,

899
00:59:34,125 --> 00:59:36,458
stay here and be miserable.

900
00:59:41,959 --> 00:59:43,750
(lively music)

901
00:59:59,166 --> 01:00:00,333
Thanks for the ride.

902
01:00:00,333 --> 01:00:01,792
- Yeah, no problem.

903
01:00:02,458 --> 01:00:06,125
- Can I make it up to you?

904
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:09,417
- No, no, don't worry about it.

905
01:00:09,417 --> 01:00:11,625
- Why don't we get a
bite to eat sometime?

906
01:00:11,625 --> 01:00:12,333
As friends.

907
01:00:12,333 --> 01:00:15,333
Nothing weird, I promise.

908
01:00:18,125 --> 01:00:20,834
(dramatic music)

909
01:00:23,875 --> 01:00:24,750
- When?

910
01:00:26,583 --> 01:00:29,083
- I'm free Saturday night.

911
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:30,750
(dramatic music)

912
01:00:34,125 --> 01:00:36,000
- All right.

913
01:00:39,542 --> 01:00:40,375
- Okay.

914
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:44,750
Pick me up at six?

915
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:46,375
- [James] Yeah.

916
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:46,917
- Okay.

917
01:00:51,417 --> 01:00:52,208
See you.

918
01:00:55,291 --> 01:00:58,083
(dramatic music)

919
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:09,625
(engine starting)

920
01:01:17,333 --> 01:01:20,959
(phone ringing)

921
01:01:45,834 --> 01:01:48,458
(door creaking)

922
01:01:57,333 --> 01:01:58,792
- [James] Good?

923
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:01,834
- [Charlie] Yeah.

924
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,500
- Yeah, my Dad's been
teaching himself how to cook,

925
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:11,083
so not bad now actually.

926
01:02:11,083 --> 01:02:13,417
- See, he doesn't need you.

927
01:02:18,166 --> 01:02:21,125
- Naw, he needs my
help on the farm.

928
01:02:25,667 --> 01:02:26,959
My mom would want me to stay.

929
01:02:26,959 --> 01:02:30,000
- Your mom would want
you to live your life.

930
01:02:50,125 --> 01:02:50,959
Hey.

931
01:02:55,834 --> 01:02:56,875
What was it like there?

932
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:02,875
(dramatic music)

933
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:07,083
- My Dad found the place online.

934
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:19,750
I don't know if he even knew
what he was looking for, but,

935
01:03:20,959 --> 01:03:25,125
I think he knew that they were
Christian therapists, and,

936
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:31,041
it was always a big
part of my mom's life.

937
01:03:36,625 --> 01:03:39,083
Felt so bad at first.

938
01:03:41,125 --> 01:03:43,750
Had a lot of grief and anger.

939
01:03:44,959 --> 01:03:47,625
Was mad at God and my mom and...

940
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:52,208
They helped me get past that.

941
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,750
And they said if I
wanted someone to blame,

942
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:02,959
I really oughta blame myself.

943
01:04:07,667 --> 01:04:10,458
They said that sometimes
we don't live our lives

944
01:04:10,458 --> 01:04:12,667
according to God's
plan, He sends us a sign

945
01:04:12,667 --> 01:04:14,792
to get us back on track.

946
01:04:19,834 --> 01:04:22,458
- I hope you don't believe that.

947
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:23,583
- I started to.

948
01:04:23,583 --> 01:04:27,166
(gentle music)

949
01:04:44,208 --> 01:04:45,208
- [Charlie] Are you okay?

950
01:04:45,208 --> 01:04:47,667
- [James] Yeah, yeah.

951
01:04:47,667 --> 01:04:50,291
- [Charlie] You still as
fast as you used to me?

952
01:04:50,291 --> 01:04:50,333
- What?

953
01:04:51,875 --> 01:04:54,125
(laughing)

954
01:04:57,709 --> 01:05:00,458

955
01:05:02,542 --> 01:05:04,709

01:05:07,041 --> 01:05:09,250

01:08:59,166 --> 01:09:00,709

01:09:00,709 --> 01:09:01,417

990
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:10,625
We should get up.

Yes.

992
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:13,875
- No.

993
01:09:13,875 --> 01:09:15,000
- Before my Dad wakes up.

994
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:15,709
- No.

995
01:09:15,709 --> 01:09:16,792
- And kills us.

996
01:09:16,792 --> 01:09:17,792
- No.

997
01:09:17,792 --> 01:09:18,917
(laughing)

998
01:09:18,917 --> 01:09:19,709
No.

999
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:27,333
(phone ringing)

1000
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Hi.

1001
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:33,959
- [James] Hi.

1002
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:44,000
- I really missed you.

1003
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,417
- I missed you too.

1004
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:54,959
- What the hell is that?

1005
01:09:54,959 --> 01:09:55,875
- Suzy.

1006
01:09:55,875 --> 01:09:57,000
Suzy.

1007
01:09:58,667 --> 01:09:59,917
Suzy.

1008
01:09:59,917 --> 01:10:00,834
Suzy, wait.

1009
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:03,583
Suzy.

1010
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,792
Suzy, Suzy, wait.

1011
01:10:06,792 --> 01:10:07,250
Listen, I'm sorry.

1012
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:07,750
- You bastard.

1013
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:09,792
You're a bastard!

1014
01:10:09,792 --> 01:10:10,750
Don't touch me!

1015
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:12,500
- Wait a second.

1016
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,291
Will you listen to me?

1017
01:10:13,291 --> 01:10:14,041
- You know what you are?

1018
01:10:14,041 --> 01:10:15,041
You're disgusting.

1019
01:10:15,041 --> 01:10:16,542
You're pathetic.

1020
01:10:16,542 --> 01:10:17,417
Rot in hell.

1021
01:10:24,709 --> 01:10:25,709
- Hey.

1022
01:10:25,709 --> 01:10:26,458
(engine starting)

1023
01:10:26,458 --> 01:10:27,375
You okay?

1024
01:10:27,375 --> 01:10:28,208
- Yeah.

1025
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:30,792
Yeah, I'm fine.

1026
01:10:36,166 --> 01:10:37,000
- James.

1027
01:10:42,208 --> 01:10:42,875
- Go wait in the truck.

1028
01:10:42,875 --> 01:10:44,458
- Yeah.

1029
01:11:01,208 --> 01:11:02,000
- Hi.

1030
01:11:05,083 --> 01:11:09,166
Listen, that probably
looked pretty bad.

1031
01:11:09,166 --> 01:11:10,375
I had to break up
with Suzy just now,

1032
01:11:10,375 --> 01:11:13,083
and Charlie's a friend from...

1033
01:11:13,917 --> 01:11:15,000
- Just stop.

1034
01:11:18,333 --> 01:11:22,834
I honestly have no
idea what to do.

1035
01:11:22,834 --> 01:11:24,083
I mean, maybe if your mother
was here she would know,

1036
01:11:24,083 --> 01:11:26,375
but I have no idea.

1037
01:11:30,291 --> 01:11:31,208
- About what?

1038
01:11:31,208 --> 01:11:32,291
- About you.

1039
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:35,792
About how to help ya.

1040
01:11:42,083 --> 01:11:43,917
- Help me with what?

1041
01:11:43,917 --> 01:11:47,250
- To help ya grow
up, help ya be a man.

1042
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,291
- I am a man.

1043
01:11:49,291 --> 01:11:52,625
- Yeah, you're
one hell of a man.

1044
01:11:55,917 --> 01:11:56,834
- Go ahead.

1045
01:11:57,208 --> 01:11:58,417
Say it.

1046
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:03,792
Go ahead, say it.

1047
01:12:03,792 --> 01:12:05,500
No, no no.

1048
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:06,500
Come on, I want you to.

1049
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:10,834
Oh, that's okay.

1050
01:12:12,458 --> 01:12:16,583
You were never the kind of man
I wanted for a father either.

1051
01:12:23,667 --> 01:12:26,667
If Mom saw you now, she'd
be ashamed, you know that?

1052
01:12:26,667 --> 01:12:28,375
- That makes two of us I guess.

1053
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:29,709
- [James] I guess.

1054
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:38,917
(dramatic music)

1055
01:12:43,208 --> 01:12:46,125
(country music)

1056
01:12:50,959 --> 01:12:53,709
- Well, look what the
pole cat dragged in.

1057
01:12:53,709 --> 01:12:56,500
Haven't seen you
in a while, Ricky.

1058
01:13:06,291 --> 01:13:09,083
Awfully early to be piss drunk.

1059
01:13:09,083 --> 01:13:11,417
- You want my money or not?

1060
01:13:14,917 --> 01:13:16,041
- [Bartender] Saw
your boy in here

1061
01:13:16,041 --> 01:13:17,375
a while back with a pretty girl.

1062
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:18,709
- Not my boy.

1063
01:13:18,709 --> 01:13:20,709
I don't even know him.

1064
01:13:20,709 --> 01:13:22,500
- [Bartender] Well,
I'm sure every father

1065
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,333
said that about their boy
at some point or another.

1066
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:25,458
- Bullshit.

1067
01:13:25,458 --> 01:13:27,375
I minded my old man.

1068
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:31,750
- Didn't you tell me one
time about when you were 17,

1069
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:33,792
you wanted to run away

1070
01:13:33,792 --> 01:13:36,166
'cause your old man wouldn't
let you join the army?

1071
01:13:36,166 --> 01:13:37,875
- You don't remember as
well as you think you do.

1072
01:13:37,875 --> 01:13:38,709
- [Bartender] Oh no?

1073
01:13:38,709 --> 01:13:40,125
- No.

1074
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:43,333
I was 18, it was the marines.

1075
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:45,750
And I would have made
a damn fine one too.

1076
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:47,917
- Oh, of course you would.

1077
01:13:48,583 --> 01:13:51,083
You ever think about that?

1078
01:13:51,083 --> 01:13:52,834
- What, marines?

1079
01:13:52,834 --> 01:13:53,792
- You could have seen the world,

1080
01:13:53,792 --> 01:13:58,500
never know where you
would have ended up.

1081
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:02,542
- You don't always get
what you want in this life.

1082
01:14:04,583 --> 01:14:06,250
- So, I hear there's this

1083
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:09,750
really nice couple pokin'
around town lately,

1084
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:11,291
looking to buy up some land.

1085
01:14:11,291 --> 01:14:12,417
They been out to see you?

1086
01:14:12,417 --> 01:14:13,792
- They have.

1087
01:14:13,792 --> 01:14:15,083
- And how was their offer?

1088
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:17,375
- Insufficient.

1089
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:20,583
- That is a shame.

1090
01:14:21,917 --> 01:14:23,834
If it were more,
you might be able

1091
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:26,458
to get out of the
apple business.

1092
01:14:26,458 --> 01:14:26,792
Live a little.

1093
01:14:28,417 --> 01:14:30,542
- I'm not a young man anymore.

1094
01:14:30,542 --> 01:14:32,583
- Well, you're not
worn out either.

1095
01:14:40,834 --> 01:14:42,375
- See you around.

1096
01:14:43,417 --> 01:14:44,959
- Take care, Ricky.

1097
01:14:44,959 --> 01:14:45,583
Don't be a stranger.

1098
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:26,834
(dramatic music)

1099
01:16:43,709 --> 01:16:44,875
- What about your Dad?

1100
01:16:46,375 --> 01:16:48,667
- I don't know.

1101
01:16:52,542 --> 01:16:55,333
I don't think I can go home.

1102
01:16:55,333 --> 01:16:56,458
- You think he'll hurt you?

1103
01:16:56,458 --> 01:16:57,917
- No.

1104
01:16:57,917 --> 01:17:01,333
No.

1105
01:17:01,333 --> 01:17:05,750
I just don't think he
wants me there anymore.

1106
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:07,333
- Then stay with me.

1107
01:17:10,458 --> 01:17:13,166
- That's not a
permanent solution.

1108
01:17:14,792 --> 01:17:15,166
- Then we'll leave.

1109
01:17:15,166 --> 01:17:16,750
- Oh yeah?

1110
01:17:18,709 --> 01:17:20,083
Where would we go?

1111
01:17:21,083 --> 01:17:22,375
- I don't know.

1112
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:24,917
Enter the circus.

1113
01:17:28,458 --> 01:17:30,125
- I'll just go, and,

1114
01:17:32,458 --> 01:17:35,709
pack my clothes,
whatever else I need.

1115
01:17:36,834 --> 01:17:36,875
Then leave.

1116
01:17:45,458 --> 01:17:47,041
And then the circus.

1117
01:17:47,375 --> 01:17:48,750
Okay.

1118
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:54,208
(gentle music)

1119
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:14,375
- [Cashier] All
right, here you go.

1120
01:18:14,375 --> 01:18:16,291
- [Customer] Thank you.

1121
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:17,000
- [Cashier] You're welcome.

1122
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,875
Have a great day.

1123
01:18:18,875 --> 01:18:19,583
Hey Rich.

1124
01:18:19,583 --> 01:18:20,458
- [Richard] Hey.

1125
01:18:20,458 --> 01:18:21,709
- How's the apple business?

1126
01:18:21,709 --> 01:18:23,083
- [Richard] Oh, it's
fine, just fine.

1127
01:18:23,083 --> 01:18:24,417
Listen, I'm sorry
they're so late.

1128
01:18:24,417 --> 01:18:25,208
- Oh, don't worry about it.

1129
01:18:25,208 --> 01:18:26,333
I'll grab your receipt.

1130
01:18:26,333 --> 01:18:27,834
- [Richard] Thanks.

1131
01:18:48,333 --> 01:18:49,291
- Excuse me.

1132
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:50,959
- [Richard] Oh sure.

1133
01:18:56,375 --> 01:18:57,750
- Here you go.

1134
01:18:58,792 --> 01:19:00,917
- So, a lot of folks
go for the organic?

1135
01:19:00,917 --> 01:19:03,792
- Yeah, actually,
they're very popular.

1136
01:19:03,792 --> 01:19:06,875
Let's see, Winston Clark
switched to organic.

1137
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:07,625
You know Winston?

1138
01:19:07,625 --> 01:19:08,417
- [Richard] Yeah.

1139
01:19:08,417 --> 01:19:08,917
- Yeah.

1140
01:19:08,917 --> 01:19:10,625
And the Shelleys.

1141
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:12,375
The Shelleys were
here on Monday.

1142
01:19:12,375 --> 01:19:13,500
They said they're
thinking about it.

1143
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,250
I'll see you later.

1144
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:16,792
- All right.

1145
01:19:16,792 --> 01:19:19,417
- Hi, how can I help you?

1146
01:19:19,417 --> 01:19:20,583
That's it.

1147
01:19:20,583 --> 01:19:21,417
All right.

1148
01:19:24,083 --> 01:19:26,500
Okay, that will be 11 dollars.

1149
01:20:25,458 --> 01:20:28,125
(dramatic music)

1150
01:22:23,667 --> 01:22:27,667
(gentle piano music)

1151
01:23:15,125 --> 01:23:17,709
- [Richard] Play it
better than she did.

1152
01:23:17,709 --> 01:23:20,041
- [James] I was...

1153
01:23:20,041 --> 01:23:20,917
- [Richard] James.

1154
01:23:20,917 --> 01:23:22,542
- [James] I was just leaving.

1155
01:23:22,542 --> 01:23:23,792
I really don't wanna talk
about this right now.

1156
01:23:23,792 --> 01:23:24,875
- Just wait.

1157
01:23:27,166 --> 01:23:28,333
Sit down.

1158
01:23:28,333 --> 01:23:28,375
Please.

1159
01:23:30,083 --> 01:23:30,333
For a minute.

1160
01:23:44,125 --> 01:23:45,500
Where you goin'?

1161
01:23:47,917 --> 01:23:50,542
- I was thinking
of going to Boston.

1162
01:23:50,542 --> 01:23:51,500
- [Richard] Alone?

1163
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:52,291
- No.

1164
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:00,458
- Is he...

1165
01:24:00,458 --> 01:24:02,834
What's his name again?

1166
01:24:02,834 --> 01:24:03,583
- Charlie.

1167
01:24:03,583 --> 01:24:04,667
- Charlie.

1168
01:24:05,333 --> 01:24:07,625
Is he the one from before?

1169
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:10,291
- Yeah.

1170
01:24:16,792 --> 01:24:19,166
- Your mother and I were
pretty concerned about that.

1171
01:24:19,166 --> 01:24:23,166
That's how you ended
up at that place.

1172
01:24:23,166 --> 01:24:24,917
I'm sorry about that.

1173
01:24:28,458 --> 01:24:29,291
Ah...

1174
01:24:32,083 --> 01:24:34,250
You care about each other?

1175
01:24:36,667 --> 01:24:37,834
- Yeah.

1176
01:24:39,542 --> 01:24:40,834
Yeah, we do, very much.

1177
01:24:40,834 --> 01:24:44,208
(gentle music)

1178
01:24:44,208 --> 01:24:45,291
- That's good.

1179
01:24:49,375 --> 01:24:51,625
I wanna apologize for
what I said yesterday.

1180
01:24:51,625 --> 01:24:52,959
That wasn't right.

1181
01:24:54,959 --> 01:24:58,792
I don't know if I'll
ever understand it, but,

1182
01:24:58,792 --> 01:25:02,542
I think I can do a better
job of accepting it.

1183
01:25:08,792 --> 01:25:09,917
- Thank you.

1184
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:13,959
(gentle music)

1185
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,375
- I've decided to sell the farm.

1186
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:23,875
- What?

1187
01:25:23,875 --> 01:25:26,667
- [Richard] I took their offer.

1188
01:25:26,667 --> 01:25:27,917
- Why, why did you?

1189
01:25:27,917 --> 01:25:29,125
- You know, I've been
running this place

1190
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:31,875
for the last 20
years for my Dad,

1191
01:25:31,875 --> 01:25:35,875
when I should have been
running it for you.

1192
01:25:35,875 --> 01:25:37,083
I'll give you some of the money.

1193
01:25:37,083 --> 01:25:41,750
You can go to school, move
away, do whatever you want.

1194
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:42,333
I guess I'll retire.

1195
01:25:45,125 --> 01:25:45,917
Anyway.

1196
01:25:47,125 --> 01:25:49,875
The farm isn't family, we are.

1197
01:25:56,834 --> 01:25:59,250
- Dad, I'm sorry that things
didn't really work out.

1198
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:00,083
- Don't.

1199
01:26:00,959 --> 01:26:02,083
That's life.

1200
01:26:04,875 --> 01:26:07,834
We'll just do the
best we can, okay?

1201
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:12,333
- Okay.

1202
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:15,083
(gentle music)

1203
01:26:39,458 --> 01:26:40,917
- [Richard] You didn't miss it.

1204
01:26:40,917 --> 01:26:42,000
- [James] No, no.

1205
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:42,625
I still got about 10 minutes.

1206
01:26:42,625 --> 01:26:45,125
- [Richard] Okay, then.

1207
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:47,875
- [James] Well, I
should, we should...

1208
01:26:47,875 --> 01:26:48,709
- Yeah.

1209
01:27:08,208 --> 01:27:09,000
I...

1210
01:27:15,125 --> 01:27:18,041
Call if you need anything.

1211
01:27:18,041 --> 01:27:18,875
- I will.

1212
01:27:19,917 --> 01:27:24,208
- Your mother would
have been proud of you.

1213
01:27:26,583 --> 01:27:26,625
I am too.

1214
01:27:28,875 --> 01:27:31,625
(gentle music)

1215
01:27:43,667 --> 01:27:45,959
Well, you better get goin'.

1216
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:47,792
- Yeah.

1217
01:27:50,458 --> 01:27:53,291
(gentle music)

1218
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:49,083
