1
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,463
Hey, kiddo, what are you doing?

2
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:31,716
I buy you a fancy Mexican meal
and you're feeding it to a mutt.

3
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,009
Real fancy.

4
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,137
You have any idea what that is?

5
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:38,723
What? Tree chicken.

6
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,933
What?
That's what the locals call it.

7
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,896
Colds, headaches, hangovers,
cures anything.

8
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,690
Iguana. That's what they say.

9
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:53,488
What about indigestion?
Fuckin' iguana taco.

10
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:57,575
Yeah, well,
you had it in Salvador.

11
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,702
Yeah, and that was shit.

12
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,789
What about Angola?
The food was good there, right?

13
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:03,873
Shit.

14
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,334
Yeah, Rhodesia? Shit.

15
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:07,543
Hamburg? Shit.

16
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:09,962
So if it's not New York,
it's...

17
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,088
You got it. Shit.

18
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,216
Look at you wasting away.

19
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,551
We got to get a job
in New York.

20
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,638
That won't be a problem.
Plenty of assholes there.

21
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,225
Time to move, kiddo.

22
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:34,797
Oops.

24
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,708
Fuck!

25
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,219
Stay down!

26
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,727
Stay down, kid.

27
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,039
What happened?
There was a kid in the car.

28
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,332
What?
There was a kid in the car.

29
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,084
Go, go, go, go! Fuck!

30
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,269
I'm done with this.
I'm finished.

31
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,273
I can't do this any more.

32
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,819
I can't do this.

33
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,051
Oh, shit!

34
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,355
Shit!

35
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,545
Danny, get in.

36
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,631
These camel jockeys have got
diseases I don't wanna think about.

37
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,757
Where is he?

38
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:47,925
The client still has him.

39
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,051
What client?

40
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,053
We're going there now.

41
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,056
Okay, drive.

42
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,524
So the client's
an oil sheikh, no less.

43
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:07,361
He used to rule some huge stretch of
desert till his tribe kicked him out.

44
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,989
Been living here
in exile ever since.

45
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:13,492
Anyway, Sheikhy was loaded
and he wanted a job done.

46
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,203
Hunter took the contract,
then he ran.

47
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,997
They caught him at the airport.

48
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,208
And?

49
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,377
You know the rest.
You got the package.

50
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,380
Yeah, I got it.

51
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:28,841
What's the job?

52
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,384
Just came with a price tag,
no details.

53
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,136
Hunter took it cold.

54
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,637
Why would he do that?

55
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,097
Six million dollars.

56
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,557
A big score, Danny.

57
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,767
Too bloody big for Hunter.

58
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:39,852
Yeah.

59
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,187
Why'd you offer it to him?

60
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,897
He wanted the money.

61
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,732
And you were out, remember?

62
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,734
Yeah. Still am.

63
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:49,862
I'm done with killing.

64
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,239
Yeah, well, maybe
killing ain't done with you.

65
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,743
Hunter needs the old Danny,
the best in the biz.

66
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,495
The one with balls of steel.
You remember him, right?

67
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,290
Look, it comes down to this.

68
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,835
You don't do this job,
Hunter's a dead man.

69
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,844
They're waiting for you.

70
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,726
This way.

71
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,438
He's waiting
for his eyes to adjust.

72
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,859
Be careful
around this one, boy.

73
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,657
My son forgets
the ways of the desert.

74
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:21,161
Since our war against the Sultan,
all he has had of his homeland

75
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,498
is this paint. Plaster.

76
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,670
My first son, Hussain,
was slaughtered here.

77
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,552
Shot before his children.

78
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,848
And here,
at the Battle of Mirbat,

79
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,892
his brother, Salim, was
wounded and then killed.

80
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:46,729
Murdered.

81
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:54,320
And then my third son
was taken from me. Ali.

82
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,576
Hunted down and slaughtered.

83
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,998
The law of the desert
says the blood of the victim

84
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,751
must be washed away
by the blood of the killers.

85
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:13,797
But I refused revenge and saved my
last son, Bakhait, from the war.

86
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:16,925
So I was exiled to this desert.

87
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:21,096
I have wealth, power.

88
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,058
But rich men die, too.

89
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,563
When I die, I want Bakhait
to go home to my tribe.

90
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:33,609
But for that to happen, the killers
of my sons must be killed.

91
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,905
You don't need me
or Hunter for this.

92
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,406
You got all the men you need.

93
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,950
What use would my
men be in England?

94
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,161
England?

95
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:50,626
The English sent their fiercest
dogs to kill for the Sultan's oil.

96
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,505
The SAS? Yes.

97
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,840
Their glorious special forces.

98
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,968
It was a war.
It was not England's war.

99
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:05,057
They came to my land, murdered my
sons, now they will face my law.

100
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,353
The doctors say I have
six months left to live.

101
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,898
You must avenge my sons
before I die

102
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,983
or your friend
will die with me.

103
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,194
I don't care how
you kill the killers.

104
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,447
But they will admit
their guilt on tape,

105
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:23,700
and their deaths must
look like accidents.

106
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,203
This must not
lead back to my son.

107
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:34,086
So go, show the English a war isn't
over till both sides say it is.

108
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,964
I wanna see Hunter.

109
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,858
Oh, Danny!

110
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:59,111
No, Danny. No, no, no, no. No.

111
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,905
What are you doing here?
Get out of here.

112
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:05,742
You all right?

113
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,244
Am I all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.

114
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,997
You gotta go. Get away from here.
Go, go, go, go.

115
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,623
I'm not here for you anyway.

116
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,042
I was thinking about
the girls and Celine.

117
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,669
Me, too. Me, too.

118
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,714
What's that supposed to mean?

119
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,383
It's tough putting
food on the table.

120
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,928
What you feeding 'em?
Six million, no questions?

121
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,180
Well.

122
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,015
So you must've known
that was a bullshit job.

123
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,141
Yeah, I knew.

124
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,393
Fuckin' SAS,
a one-way ticket for sure.

125
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,272
Well, you took the job,
and I'm not leaving you here.

126
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,402
Hey!

127
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,324
Give this man a drink.

128
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,037
I missed you.
I didn't miss you.

129
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:53,582
Every day you were out of this
game was a good day for me.

130
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,167
I was proud of you
when you got out.

131
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,128
Stay out.

132
00:13:58,213 --> 00:13:59,254
Too late.

133
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,674
You should have stayed away.

134
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,094
Or run faster.

135
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,319
Son of a bitch!

136
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:08,156
What are you doing?
Let me get my watch back.

137
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,351
Go, go!

138
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,187
Go!

139
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:51,658
Go, go, get the door!

140
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:53,910
Get the door!

141
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,757
Give me the gun.

142
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:21,188
Bravo! Bravo! If you need to
be shot, I'll happily oblige.

143
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:26,610
I'm sorry, kiddo.

144
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,445
My father needs him alive.

145
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,120
Nice try. You know
they'd have found you.

146
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:43,877
Everybody gets found.

147
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,175
You knew.

148
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,095
My gut tells me you knew the target
and you knew Hunter wouldn't take it.

149
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:54,721
You used him as bait.

150
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,431
That's a lot of angles, Danny.

151
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,225
Do you think I'm that smart?

152
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:04,106
Get out. And you. Out.

153
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,465
We missed you
at the dance last night.

154
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,635
I'm not much of a dancer.

155
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,930
Besides, I'm still trying to find
out how much house is under this.

156
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:40,183
Right, big plans.
Yeah, maybe too big.

157
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,568
You don't remember me, do you?

158
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,946
Yeah, well, it's been a while.

159
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,534
I'm Anne Frazer.

160
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,373
Anne Frazer?

161
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,168
- Anne had red hair full of grass.
- Yeah.

162
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,794
And weird red gumboots.

163
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,212
With eyes on them.

164
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,630
Oh, my God!

165
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,693
Oi! You owe me 50 quid.
Told you he'd be back, didn't I?

166
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,032
We missed you. Yeah?

167
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:39,910
Here I am.

168
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,411
All right, then, you want some?

169
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,294
Yeah, mate, you still got it.
Still got that edge.

170
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,712
You're a real killer.

171
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,677
Come on, let's talk.

172
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,640
While you were away, you
didn't start a family, did you?

173
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:02,849
No.

174
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:04,184
So no one's depending on you?

175
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,103
Only Hunter.

176
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:11,233
'Cause one, you're
going after the SAS.

177
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,860
They're a paranoid bunch.
They always got their back up.

178
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:18,448
Two, you need info on Oman.
No one talks about Oman.

179
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:22,202
They went in there as advisors and ended up
fighting the fucking war. Real hush-hush,

180
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,703
semi-mercenary stuff.

181
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,705
Three, you need confessions.

182
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,457
They're trained
to resist torture

183
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:29,584
so no matter what you say
or do, they'll say nothing.

184
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:30,919
And four, Danny,

185
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,588
this is the best special
forces regiment in the world.

186
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,757
They make the Navy Seals look
like a bunch of cupcakes.

187
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:39,845
And not only that, you're trying to
take down three of their geezers

188
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,054
and make it look
like an accident.

189
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,599
All I'm asking is
give it some thought.

190
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:45,767
Take a day, more if you want.

191
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,269
I'm going anyway.

192
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,357
Of course I'm in, you silly bastard.
It's what we do, right?

193
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,526
Anyway, I've got a score
to settle with them.

194
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,444
Tried out for them
when I was in the Paras.

195
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,946
Did Hereford,
the whole fucking lot.

196
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,698
What,
and they wouldn't have you?

197
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,159
You want this
bottle shoved up your arse?

198
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,496
Are you upset? Would you like a lolly?
I'd love a lolly.

199
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:08,039
Strawberry or fuck you?

200
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,332
Meier.

201
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,376
In.

202
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,003
Why?

203
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:16,464
Ah, six million reasons.
So what's the split?

204
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:21,303
After the Agent takes his
slice, 50-50 between you two.

205
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,430
50-50? How about you?

206
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:24,890
I'm in this for Hunter.

207
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,308
How wonderfully touching.

208
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:27,976
Touching, but fuckin' stupid.

209
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,230
The Sheikh could only ID
one of the killers.

210
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:35,066
I need you to come up with
the names on the other two.

211
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,402
Start with the one
they killed at Mirbat.

212
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,363
So the one target we do have
is Steven Douglas Harris.

213
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,282
Stayed on in Oman
after the war.

214
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,826
Ended up flying choppers
for the Sultan's armed forces.

215
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,202
Great. A juice junkie.

216
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,288
Me and Meier'll head there
to track him down.

217
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,375
Boys? Danny. Meier.

218
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,350
What the fuck!

219
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,690
Harris!

220
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,693
Harris, you prick!

221
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:20,654
Fuck off!

222
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,245
Well, I hope the buggers like
sand in their burgers, huh?

223
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,294
White Range Rover
coming your way.

224
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:37,879
It's Harris.

225
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,112
What are you doing?

226
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,157
Come on, have a go. No.

227
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,242
Come on. I'm not.

228
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,410
Have a go. Look.

229
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,246
Just aim and shoot.
Go! Here we go!

230
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,251
Oh, you horny git! Come on.

231
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,585
No. Come on.

232
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,254
Come on.

233
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,410
All right, ladies, you can
throw your knickers if you want.

234
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:34,871
Go on, you cheeky bugger!

235
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,291
- You serve in Oman?
- At Mirbat.

236
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,168
That was a day, wasn't it?

237
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,754
What about Mirbat?
That was a right mess, eh?

238
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,547
Wasn't good.
I had a mate there.

239
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:58,186
- Spike, get that quick.
- Yeah, all right, all right.

240
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:02,982
Bollocks.

241
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:05,902
Hello? Spikey, it's Bazza.

242
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,656
God's sake! I'm unplugging that bloody
thing next time, and I mean it.

243
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,784
Yeah, I'm onto this
bloke here, right.

244
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:16,412
He was in the Bear earlier pumping
some SAS lads for info on Mirbat.

245
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,123
Mirbat. And?

246
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,916
He says he's Welsh.
But he don't sound it.

247
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,502
I don't know.
Maybe I'm being a bit paranoid, but...

248
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,837
Hey, just 'cause
you're being paranoid,

249
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:26,548
doesn't mean to say
they're not out to get you.

250
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,718
All right, mate,
give me what you've got.

251
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:33,221
Okay.
Put one of my Locals onto him.

252
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,088
- The Omani Embassy.
- Our Local followed him into the visa section.

253
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,009
Says he's Welsh,
calls himself Mr. Jones.

254
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:13,094
We lost him after he left.

255
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,429
Lost him? How come?

256
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,848
He never came back
to his car. Stolen.

257
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,767
Anyhow, he flies to Oman
in four days.

258
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:22,854
I'd like permission to send one
of my boys out there to tail him.

259
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,523
This was definitely
some kind of recce.

260
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:28,776
That was a dirty war.
What we did there was questionable.

261
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:31,029
Oman is a bloody hornet's nest.

262
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,989
Right. And if this bugger
is poking at it,

263
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,283
I want to know who he is.
I say we send a Local.

264
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,492
Any objections?

265
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,621
Noted. We'll leave you
to choose the right man.

266
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:43,124
I'd also like it noted
that we are ex-SAS.

267
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,418
The men we protect are ex-SAS.

268
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:49,297
And you, Spike, though you
hate to admit it, are ex-SAS.

269
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,383
Remember, we're
businessmen and bankers now.

270
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,260
What we do here is illegal.

271
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:57,555
We can leave no trace
of our activities.

272
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,265
That's why we're called
The Feather Men,

273
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:03,311
'cause our touch is light.

274
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,941
Now, Spike's a good man.

275
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:10,360
Day the SAS lost him,
they lost a good soldier.

276
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,529
Yes, but the problem
is he thinks he's still in the SAS.

277
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,323
Well, someone has to do
the dirty work.

278
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,450
None of us want blood
on our pinstripes.

279
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:22,830
Listen, I've got no problem with blood.
What worries me is ink.

280
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,125
Make sure he keeps us
out of the newspapers.

281
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,252
What's doing, boss?

282
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:28,753
Your Arabic's
still good, right?

283
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,380
Good enough.
You're going to Oman.

284
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:32,173
I've got a bloke I want you
to tail out there.

285
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,803
You lucky bastard!

286
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,024
You know what? You're gorgeous.

287
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,111
Where are you staying?

288
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:54,445
I'm staying at the Hilton.

289
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,657
As a matter of fact, so am I.
What room are you in?

290
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,201
Why? Would you like to know?
Love to.

291
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:02,495
You are smooth.

292
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:18,803
What are we doing out here,
then, in the middle of nowhere?

293
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,471
Well, I ask him
to go hide it, he hides it.

294
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,598
Could've been your asshole,
consider yourself lucky.

295
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:24,684
Shut it, Meier.

296
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,728
Appreciate it, thank you.

297
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,695
These tiles are an exact
match to the shower step?

298
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:37,322
Hundred percent.

299
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:40,241
Harris comes home, parks the car.
It's been a hard day.

300
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:41,951
I'll have a shower. Whoops.

301
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:45,872
He slips on the shampoo, hits the
corner of the step with his occiput.

302
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,291
Case closed. Get out of it.

303
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,793
You boys are going
about this all wrong.

304
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:52,420
That bird he's screwing
is married.

305
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,007
Why don't we just pop 'em both and
make it look like her husband did it.

306
00:27:56,091 --> 00:28:00,595
Pop 'em both? What's she ever done?
It's Harris we're after.

307
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,097
Poor bastard.

308
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,726
Ten years after the war, he cops it for
doing something he was ordered to do.

309
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:08,686
He knew what he was doing
when he joined the club.

310
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,938
Yeah, what club?
The killing club.

311
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,150
It could be you or me.
Yeah, but it's not...

312
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,277
I'm just glad
I never killed a raghead.

313
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:18,196
No offense, my son.

314
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,447
Let's get this done.

315
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,533
- Excuse my friend.
- He's a royal asshole.

316
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:33,419
Shit!

317
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:44,138
- Where's he gonna run?
- It's the middle of the fuckin' desert.

318
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:48,142
Son of a...

319
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,821
Meier, cut him off at the next shaft!
Let's go, let's go.

320
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:06,702
Where is he?

321
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,125
Shh.

322
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:51,247
- Let's get out here.
- Fuckin' hell!

323
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,380
So what, now
somebody's on our ass?

324
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:00,673
We should move right away.

325
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,592
We'll set up Harris'
interview for tomorrow.

326
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:05,011
Davies, you make sure
his girl doesn't show.

327
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:06,345
She has nothing
to do with this.

328
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,073
Wanker!

329
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,711
- We're military historians.
- I'll do the talking, all right?

330
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,131
Well, it's 5:00 somewhere,
isn't it?

331
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,218
So where's this documentary
gonna be shown, then?

332
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:46,302
On the telly?

333
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
The chair.

334
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,812
Those bastards in C Company
put this together. Hmm?

335
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,467
- What's the matter?
- They didn't like sand in their burgers?

336
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:28,010
Eh?

337
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:31,305
Hello, boys. I'm not saying a
word till I see my lawyer.

338
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:34,267
Think back. The village of Qum.

339
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,936
You killed
a guerilla commander.

340
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:40,773
His name was Hussain bin Amr.
Do you admit it?

341
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,488
Fuck off!

342
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,282
You're kidding, right?

343
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:50,866
You commanded a company there.

344
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:55,997
Yeah, I led a company
on that op, sure.

345
00:31:56,331 --> 00:32:00,001
And you assassinated Hussain bin Amr.
There were witnesses.

346
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:03,504
You dropped him
in front of his family.

347
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:11,721
All right, you got me.
I did it. Hmm?

348
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,890
Fuck you! Good one.
Now untie me.

349
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:16,851
Get up.

350
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:19,020
Hey! Piss off!

351
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,522
We have what we need.

352
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,402
What if I told you somebody else
dropped your guerilla commander?

353
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,071
His name is...

354
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,699
I can't remember.

355
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,202
But he's writing a book
about the whole Oman gig.

356
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,079
You might find it in there.

357
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:38,873
If you could read.

358
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:40,958
To the bathroom.

359
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:44,420
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

360
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,631
It's coming back to me,
looking at your fucking face.

361
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:51,927
His name is Captain R.
Sole! A-R-S-E H-O-L-E.

362
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:54,055
Shut up.
You're fucking dead, yeah?

363
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:55,931
On your knees.

364
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,061
Fucking queers!
Serves you fucking right!

365
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,814
Head down. Get your fuckin'
hands off me, you queer!

366
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,858
- You're fuckin' kidding me.
- Hold him still.

367
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,611
If I find you, I'll put your
fuckin' head in the toilet bowl.

368
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,737
Poor fucker.

369
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,415
Jay!

370
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:26,253
I need money for the taxi.
I had to take a taxi. I had a flat.

371
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,396
Fuck you!

372
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,281
Case closed.

373
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,000
Thank you.

374
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,843
Tells of a
dramatic 12-hour rescue operation

375
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:15,970
to save the crew
of Radio Caroline.

376
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:18,055
The pirate radio
ship sank the...

377
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,728
It seems your friend
did what you couldn't.

378
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:27,648
Wouldn't.

379
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,066
Wouldn't, couldn't.

380
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,152
He's avenged Hussain.

381
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,653
Good news for the old man,
not for you.

382
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:34,655
What do you mean?

383
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,991
Three brothers dead.
Rotting in the sand.

384
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,327
You didn't wanna get
revenge yourself?

385
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,705
Scared of getting
your hands dirty?

386
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,583
Better get used to it.

387
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:49,170
No palace where you're going.
A tent and a hole to shit in.

388
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,715
He's your worst nightmare
and he's gonna do it.

389
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,219
And when he does,
you're out of here.

390
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:02,433
When I find you in that desert,
I pray God keeps my aim...

391
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,688
true.

392
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,287
Well, what do you think?

393
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,413
Yeah, it's coming along.

394
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,879
What are you doing
for New Year's Eve dinner?

395
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:33,964
Oh, shit!

396
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,680
Bollocks!

397
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:47,728
Strangers are a bit of an
exotic thing around here.

398
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:49,688
Oh, come on, I didn't
think I was a stranger.

399
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,232
I know,
but you're still exotic.

400
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,069
Danny, something tells me
you've got a story to tell.

401
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:57,363
Yeah. Mmm.

402
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:10,793
Come on,
what are you waiting for?

403
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:12,253
Party's outside.

404
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,297
Happy New Year!

405
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,053
Happy New Year!

406
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,181
It's a tradition around here.

407
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,433
Happy New Year!

408
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,169
Shit!

409
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,396
Mirbat. The artist's
name is on the back.

410
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,482
Have them talk to him.

411
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,152
One more thing.

412
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,071
My boys had some
trouble in Oman.

413
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,323
Somebody was tailing them.

414
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,575
We'll have to have a look
into that, won't we?

415
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:27,286
Yeah.

416
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:40,341
Ah, that's how you get it
so lifelike, then. Sorry?

417
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,677
Photos of the lads.
Isn't that like cheating?

418
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,972
I'm recreating an historical event.
Accuracy is everything.

419
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,098
Mmm.

420
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,893
That Mirbat painting stopped
me cold when I saw it.

421
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:51,977
You were at Mirbat?

422
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:53,187
Had a mate there.

423
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,981
I was hoping you might
have an address for him.

424
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:57,608
You're with the SAS? Was.

425
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,654
Then your best bet for an address
would be Regimental Association...

426
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:03,447
They won't talk to me.

427
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,033
Spent the last few years
plying my trade overseas.

428
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,409
Angola and that.

429
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,495
I come to you unofficial like.

430
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,372
Ah.

431
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:16,043
Well, I might have
something somewhere.

432
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:18,420
Just give me a few minutes.

433
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:19,713
Be my guest.

434
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,230
I got a bullshitter
askin' about Mirbat.

435
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,816
Yeah. He claims
he's with the regiment.

436
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,567
No, there's no way he was SAS.

437
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:44,738
Yeah, I can smell it off him.
Ah, he's a bloody fake.

438
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:11,098
My contact says
the call was cut off,

439
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,018
but Gowling said that there was
somebody there asking about Mirbat.

440
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,853
It has to be our guy.

441
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,813
And what would you
have us do about it?

442
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,148
Find him.

443
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:22,359
If we don't, there's gonna be another murder
and it will be one of our Mirbat boys.

444
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:23,777
Then who are they?

445
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,154
Well, they're pros for sure.

446
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:27,031
If these guys are
going after the SAS,

447
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,283
they're gonna be top-class
professional assassins.

448
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,702
They must have a string
of hits behind them

449
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,787
but they're completely
under the radar.

450
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:35,539
All we've got is Oman.

451
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:36,749
Oman?

452
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,333
We all know
our people went too far.

453
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:41,378
Oman, Mirbat.
It all needs to be left alone.

454
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:42,963
You should try telling
that to the Welshman.

455
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,216
He's right.

456
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:49,136
We have to find this phony
Welshman and his group.

457
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,182
The file says an SAS officer

458
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:55,142
killed the Sheikh's son
at the Battle of Mirbat.

459
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,811
Warrick Steven Cregg.

460
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:01,065
He was the only officer there that night.
Killed everything that moved.

461
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,108
He's our worst nightmare.
A real hotshot.

462
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:04,443
Paintings of him, the lot.

463
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,736
Where did you get this?

464
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:07,696
The bloke
who did the paintings.

465
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:10,741
Don't you worry
about that, all right?

466
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,034
He's shuffled off
this mortal coil.

467
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,535
That wasn't part of the deal.

468
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,663
Come on, shit happens when you play
in the deep end of the pool, Danny.

469
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:19,374
Why couldn't you two
stick to the plan, huh?

470
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,670
You've been watching this Cregg,
what's your next big idea?

471
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:25,506
His wife's in hospital.

472
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,508
When he's not training
for the selection march,

473
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:28,884
he spends most days there.

474
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,260
So why don't we hit him there?

475
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:32,471
No. Not near his family.

476
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,515
Get me everything
you know on that march.

477
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,350
We'll see where that goes.

478
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:50,322
Okay, so,

479
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,075
there's only four Mirbat
survivors in Britain.

480
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,618
I've got Locals
on the other three.

481
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,079
You get the celebrity.

482
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,413
Warrick Cregg?

483
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,540
You're kidding.

484
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,250
Wish I was.

485
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:07,131
Welcome to hell,
the SAS selection march.

486
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:10,050
Forty-one miles,
fifty-five pounds of gear.

487
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:12,010
They lose someone
every couple of years.

488
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:15,472
Don't you even think about it.

489
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:17,516
Why not?

490
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,893
During the march this place
is crawling with SAS.

491
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,063
Yeah, you said it yourself.
It's an accident waiting to happen.

492
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,482
How are you gonna
catch him then?

493
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:28,318
He's been training for months,
he's like a greyhound.

494
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:29,736
We'll just have to
slow him down, won't we?

495
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:35,117
Insulin. Chlorpropamide.

496
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,619
Initial here.

497
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:47,588
Anything doing?

498
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:49,756
No, Cregg's still in there
with his missus.

499
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:55,053
Here, boss, this will keep you going.
Cheers.

500
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:23,081
Pennock. I need you
back here, mate. Pronto.

501
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:28,689
Get out of the fucking way!

502
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:36,822
Maniac!

503
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:45,594
You wouldn't fucking believe it,
somebody was watching Cregg.

504
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,720
What? Mmm.

505
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:49,389
You think he's from the same stable
as the shooter in the desert?

506
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,183
Maybe. He was good.

507
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:53,059
Whoever he is, he's too late.

508
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:54,686
Ah, good, good.

509
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,481
Chroma slows him down.

510
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,815
Insulin

511
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:01,610
sends him into shock.

512
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,820
Hypothermia to you.

513
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,655
And when were you planning
on getting it to him?

514
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,365
Before the march.

515
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:08,450
How?

516
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:10,076
It's an SAS base, Danny.

517
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:11,578
That you trained in.

518
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:14,956
So think back.
The security layout, the lot.

519
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:19,294
You're nuts.

520
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:20,962
Are you gonna do it?

521
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:24,382
Man, you really are one crazy
son of a bitch, Danny.

522
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:42,817
Clock's ticking.
You've got under a minute, all right?

523
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:57,666
We've got company.

524
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:06,466
Lovely night.

525
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:08,134
You can't stop here, mate.

526
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,386
I didn't stop, the truck did.

527
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:10,804
If you don't fucking move it,
we will.

528
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,722
All right, all right.
But it's pissing oil, mate.

529
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:13,974
There's nothing
I can do about it.

530
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:15,308
Turn off the bloody radio.

531
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,189
Where's your gear?

532
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,580
Right. On the trucks!

533
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,207
I don't care
what regiment you're from.

534
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:23,918
I don't care how great
you think you are.

535
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:25,754
Let's see what
you're made of, ladies.

536
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,881
- On the trucks.
- Come on!

537
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,258
Get moving, you lot.

538
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,952
He only got half the dose.

539
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,205
Is it enough?

540
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:03,667
- Enough? He's a dead man walking.
- Stay on him, okay?

541
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:27,148
- His name was Salim bin Amr.
- Do you remember the name?

542
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:29,734
Did you kill him? Think back.

543
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,070
Did you kill him, Major?

544
00:50:32,405 --> 00:50:33,405
Yeah, I did.

545
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:35,573
I did the bastard.
So bloody what?

546
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:37,158
Danny didn't want to do this.

547
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,285
You did?

548
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:43,289
And your boy doesn't want
to go back to the desert.

549
00:50:57,138 --> 00:50:58,221
The Ministry of Defence

550
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:01,558
today announced the death of an
army officer during maneuvers.

551
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:04,102
Thirty-three-year-old,
Major Warrick Steven Cregg,

552
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:08,148
died of exposure during an SAS
exercise on the Brecon Beacons.

553
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:12,402
Weather conditions at the time were
described as appalling, with...

554
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:25,999
Hey! Hey!

555
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:31,171
Show a bit of respect, lads.

556
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:44,601
Top that.

557
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,978
I come bearing gifts.

558
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:50,607
Oi!

559
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,694
From my boys in Angola.

560
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:58,198
I have no idea how you're
meant to eat this.

561
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:01,201
So. So.

562
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:03,495
Who's on our ass?

563
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:04,621
I'm on it. Don't worry.

564
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:07,415
Look, there's only
one more to go.

565
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,293
After this is done, I'll get you
boys a nice, cushy job in the sun.

566
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:11,461
Hmm?

567
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:13,963
There is no "after this."

568
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,053
I'm a vulture.

569
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:21,346
I live off killers.

570
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:24,057
It gives me
a unique perspective.

571
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,476
Have you heard of the two percent?
That's you.

572
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,353
Davies, the SAS, all you lot.

573
00:52:28,604 --> 00:52:30,230
Mercenaries, hit men, heroes.

574
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:33,608
You're all part of that two percent
of men who are natural killers.

575
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:36,152
That's why
you'll never get out.

576
00:52:36,946 --> 00:52:38,571
You can't run away
from who you are, Danny.

577
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,284
That's not who I am,

578
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:44,744
that's what I've done.

579
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:47,288
And I can do something else.

580
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:48,748
Yeah, yeah.

581
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:50,083
That's all nice and good.

582
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:53,086
But let's just take care
of business first, shall we?

583
00:52:53,963 --> 00:52:56,256
Your third target,
Major Simon McCann,

584
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,217
Mad Simon McCann of late.

585
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:00,468
How'd you find him?

586
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,387
Asked around. It was easy.

587
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,974
These days, he's your basic
"cash for trash" mercenary.

588
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:09,102
He's a sitting duck.

589
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,480
Now didn't I tell you
I came bearing gifts?

590
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,608
You know where to find me.

591
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:20,154
You don't trust
that snake, do you?

592
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:21,447
He's lying.

593
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:22,782
Yeah? How do you know?

594
00:53:23,284 --> 00:53:24,534
His lips were moving.

595
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,619
He just gave us a third target.

596
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:27,871
You've done nothing
on that last file.

597
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,330
Someone's onto us.

598
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,082
I want Hunter out of there.

599
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:32,709
I want this finished.

600
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:34,502
And I want to be around to
enjoy the money when it is.

601
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:36,546
The first thing you should
buy is a pair of balls.

602
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,466
We're going after McCann,
all right?

603
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,141
I miss you.

604
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:53,062
There's a lot I don't know about
you, but I do know that much.

605
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:55,481
I convince myself
that everything's okay

606
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:58,067
because when I'm
with you I'm happy.

607
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,322
But then you go away and I realize
that I know nothing about you.

608
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:06,534
I don't know where you go and I
don't know what you do, I mean,

609
00:54:07,328 --> 00:54:08,661
you've got a whole
nother life, Danny.

610
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:12,498
Is there someone else?

611
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:13,791
Come on, Anne.

612
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:14,876
Well, then, what is it?

613
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:19,339
I mean, Jesus, what are you not telling me?
What are you hiding?

614
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:21,507
Can we talk about this
when I get back?

615
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:23,176
To hell with it.

616
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:28,890
Fuck.

617
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:41,611
What?

618
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,863
You show me a beautiful woman,

619
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,908
I'll show you a bloke
that's sick of her shit.

620
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:47,992
Shut up.

621
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,118
Roger that.

622
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:53,915
- That him?
- That's him.

623
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,209
Major Simon McCann.

624
00:54:56,669 --> 00:55:00,338
Served in the Sultan's forces till
he was pensioned out four years ago.

625
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:02,173
And another.

626
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:04,509
Oi!

627
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:05,760
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

628
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:07,845
Piss off, grandpa.
You want some?

629
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:10,598
Oh!

630
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,226
Doesn't look like an invalid.

631
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:18,439
Like I said, a bomb went off under
his jeep, scrambled his wiring.

632
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:20,233
He can't keep a job.

633
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:21,901
He's a fucking psycho.

634
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:25,822
Jesus.

635
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,952
Come on, mate, that's enough.

636
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:32,912
What's he doing here?

637
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:37,333
That's the one I went head-to-head
with at the hospital.

638
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:43,840
Right.

639
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,008
Wait, wait, wait.

640
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:52,432
Let's go.

641
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,268
Stick with him.

642
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,808
Mac, it's me. You okay?

643
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:39,395
Oh, yeah, still scraping
skinheads off my doorstep.

644
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:40,688
All right, mate.

645
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:42,648
I was just checking in.

646
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,158
Bloke who drives
that green Jag,

647
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:53,659
what's his name?

648
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:56,996
His name's Spike Logan.

649
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,915
He's an ex-soldier
of some kind.

650
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:02,835
He got his eye shot out
playing a hero somewhere.

651
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:06,172
He's got no job
and he keeps odd hours.

652
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:08,049
Hmm.

653
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,760
Don't you know
who these guys are?

654
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,262
I mean, secrets being
your bread and butter.

655
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:14,639
Don't worry about it.

656
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:17,183
I do worry about it.
You should, too.

657
00:57:17,518 --> 00:57:20,186
Every move my guys make,
these lot are waiting.

658
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:21,646
You ask me,

659
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:25,066
I think it's time you put those fancy
shoes of yours on a few throats.

660
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:28,194
Yes. But no one is asking you.

661
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:36,494
You'll be interviewing for
a security position, Mr. McCann.

662
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:37,745
Right.

663
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:40,289
Actually we got your name from
a mutual friend in the SAS.

664
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,874
Yeah, really?

665
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:44,460
So, we'll see you Tuesday
the 17th, at 10:00.

666
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:46,420
Okay. We look forward to it.

667
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:48,256
See you then.
All right, my son.

668
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:51,217
He'll be there.

669
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,553
Good. I don't get it.

670
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:57,098
McCann lives here.

671
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:00,643
He'll be here for the
interview, Tuesday at 10:00.

672
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:03,062
He'll take this road.

673
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,023
The Boston Brakes. Perfect.

674
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:07,567
They weren't perfect in Boston.

675
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:08,901
I wasn't at the controls.

676
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:10,069
We've got 10 days.

677
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:11,362
Ten days?

678
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:12,905
The quicker we get
this done, the better.

679
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:14,740
I'm going to need
to bring in some help.

680
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:16,659
- "Okay.
- " Just like that?

681
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,078
McCann's being watched.

682
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:20,913
How are you gonna get a
confession out of him?

683
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:21,998
We aren't.

684
00:58:22,374 --> 00:58:23,374
We'll fake it.

685
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:25,293
Bit of bad lighting
and camera work,

686
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,919
you could be him.

687
00:58:27,588 --> 00:58:30,464
What we'll do is play back what
he admitted to in the reports.

688
00:58:47,608 --> 00:58:48,608
Who are you?

689
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:51,944
I'm the one they let fly around in an
unmarked chopper with a gun in my pocket.

690
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:54,864
You can call me MFWIC. "MFWIC"?

691
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:57,116
Mother Fucker What's In Charge.

692
00:58:58,368 --> 00:58:59,785
We have questions.

693
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:03,998
About this little illegal club
of yours, The Feather Men.

694
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:05,791
Your attack dog,

695
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:08,002
time to bring him to heel, eh?

696
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,466
And then we'll put that
on the agenda.

697
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,634
Gentlemen.

698
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,719
We'll be with you in a minute.

699
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:26,687
I want to put Locals on Major
McCann around the clock.

700
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:30,316
I realize McCann is an old friend of
yours, but what has it to do with us?

701
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:36,739
But this is our chance to get the
bastards who killed Cregg and Harris.

702
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:40,117
The authorities found no evidence
of foul play in either case.

703
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:41,494
What are you talking about,
"No evidence?"

704
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,162
I've got the evidence
right here.

705
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:50,670
Everybody in this room knows
that those men were killed.

706
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:54,173
Everybody knows that McCann
is going to be next.

707
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:56,592
That's enough, Spike.
We have to do something.

708
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:57,969
Well, we could
put it to the vote.

709
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:00,179
Yes, but that would require
the full committee.

710
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:02,974
And it will have to wait.

711
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:21,200
Spike. That was a set-up.

712
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:23,744
He sent him away.
He knew there'd be a vote.

713
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:26,205
Spike, please. Look, listen.

714
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:28,207
This is getting big.

715
01:00:29,418 --> 01:00:32,044
The powers that be are asking questions.
Pressure's being applied.

716
01:00:32,421 --> 01:00:33,713
They have their
reputations to protect.

717
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:36,590
I'm not doing this
to protect reputations.

718
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:38,759
You know, a light
touch is one thing,

719
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:40,594
but no touch at all?
I can't do this.

720
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,973
You realize this thing is set
up for maximum deniability?

721
01:00:44,725 --> 01:00:46,058
You're the only one
who knows the Locals.

722
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:47,685
All their orders
come through you.

723
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:48,769
So?

724
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:51,230
So? If this comes out,

725
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:53,232
you're the one
who takes the fall.

726
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:55,776
Fall? From where?

727
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:59,155
I am done with this
whole committee thing.

728
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:01,907
I'm gonna find him.

729
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:05,995
He's a good kid, don't worry.

730
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:07,496
I'm shtupping his mom.

731
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,665
Does he know he can't
bring his mom on the job?

732
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:11,125
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

733
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:31,854
Tell your mates
in Oman I said hello.

734
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:33,647
Danny,

735
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,441
is this what it was like
when you were first starting?

736
01:01:36,068 --> 01:01:37,068
This is your first job?

737
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:38,527
Jesus.

738
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:42,531
My first time, I puked
for a day afterwards.

739
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,951
I was young and dumb, just
the way the army likes them.

740
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:47,703
I could be good at this, man.

741
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:50,289
I mean, it's easy, yeah?

742
01:01:50,624 --> 01:01:51,624
Killing's easy.

743
01:01:54,336 --> 01:01:55,920
Living with it
is the hard part.

744
01:02:00,384 --> 01:02:01,967
If I see him,
I'll give you a bell.

745
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:05,054
Don't be shy about
spreading the word.

746
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:07,807
There's a very
tidy finder's fee.

747
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:09,392
I'll keep my eyes peeled.

748
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:11,519
One more and we'll
call it a night.

749
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:17,358
We're on.

750
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:21,237
He's late.

751
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,325
Just keep me at 75 feet

752
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:28,160
and give me a clear line of sight.
Yeah, okay.

753
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:17,877
Where'd you buy your license?

754
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:22,715
On his tail.

755
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:24,049
Doing 60.

756
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:32,308
You'll have a visual
on Danny in one minute.

757
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:39,607
Stay with him, Jake. I got him.

758
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:43,777
We have target in sight.

759
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:44,987
Gonna miss it.

760
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:46,280
Come on, get in.
Get in behind him!

761
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:48,949
Just do it, get in!
There's not enough room!

762
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:50,618
Push him! I can't get in there.

763
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:52,203
Okay, then overtake him. Go!

764
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:53,412
Pass him!

765
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:56,248
What the hell
are you doing, Meier?

766
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,833
I need a range countdown.

767
01:03:57,918 --> 01:03:59,335
Meier, don't screw this up.

768
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:00,503
I'll operate looking backwards.

769
01:04:00,879 --> 01:04:02,046
Relax, Meier.

770
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:03,255
Davies will give you
the countdown.

771
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:08,969
400 meters.

772
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:14,975
Okay, range me.

773
01:04:19,147 --> 01:04:20,272
300 meters.

774
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:23,734
Outside lane, Meier.

775
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:27,988
200 meters.

776
01:04:32,661 --> 01:04:33,953
Here he comes.

777
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:36,872
100 meters.

778
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,217
Now, now. Now, Meier! Shut up!

779
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:49,426
Now, Meier!

780
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,096
Fishtail! Fishtail!

781
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:02,523
Oh! Oh!

782
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:03,857
You fucking got him!

783
01:05:04,276 --> 01:05:05,401
You got him, man.

784
01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:08,153
- Oh, fuck, he's dead.
- He's dead as Elvis.

785
01:05:16,997 --> 01:05:18,122
You got him, man!

786
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:19,456
Stop the car.

787
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:22,710
We gotta be sure Elvis
has left the building.

788
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:32,845
Target had a minder.

789
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:35,514
Head to the exit point.

790
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:40,311
Bring him to me.

791
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,857
He had a fucking minder. Fuck!
You got him, man. You got him!

792
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,192
Shut up! Drive! Go! Go! Go!

793
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:49,528
Who is he? I don't know.
Give me an update, Davies.

794
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:53,574
Oh, man, he's coming fast!

795
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:57,244
Up here there's a yard.
Take a left.

796
01:05:57,329 --> 01:05:59,079
Shit! Up here to the left.
Keep going.

797
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:00,205
Hold on.

798
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,083
Come in, Davies.

799
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:11,050
Davies, where the fuck are you?

800
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:12,301
Got you, you bastards.

801
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:15,471
Fuck this!

802
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:17,264
Go! Go!

803
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,060
- Here he comes!
- Here he comes!

804
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:27,691
Get out of the car!

805
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,527
Where the fuck
do you guys come from?

806
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:31,820
Step away from the car. Easy.

807
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:33,405
Jake. Yeah?

808
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:34,907
Take it easy. Check the car.

809
01:06:35,075 --> 01:06:36,075
Slowly.

810
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:38,702
No, no, no, no!

811
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:50,130
No!

812
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:10,526
He had no ID.

813
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:11,985
Nothing.

814
01:07:12,654 --> 01:07:13,946
Not a fucking thing.

815
01:07:14,823 --> 01:07:15,823
Who the fuck is he?

816
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:20,577
This shouldn't have happened.

817
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:22,037
This should not have
fucking happened!

818
01:07:22,122 --> 01:07:23,497
Take it easy, Danny. Danny...

819
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:24,623
Take it easy?

820
01:07:26,126 --> 01:07:28,085
We were out of there.
Clean. Done.

821
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:51,525
- Look, I'm getting nothing.
- Campbell's not picking up.

822
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:52,860
Is there anything at your end?
Fuck.

823
01:07:53,862 --> 01:07:55,320
Who are these bastards?

824
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:58,866
I don't know. But they're looking for
their man and they're not legit.

825
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:01,577
Jake, call this number.

826
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:05,706
Tell the Agent we need
a cleanup crew here ASAP.

827
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:07,750
And wire that radio
into my car.

828
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:09,752
Gimme here.

829
01:08:14,174 --> 01:08:15,299
That's it then. Yeah.

830
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:17,426
Done.

831
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:20,137
I fly tonight.

832
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:22,806
You should get going, too.
They're close.

833
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:24,516
What happens to Meier's cut?

834
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:26,769
There has to be somebody.

835
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:27,853
Poor sod.

836
01:08:28,563 --> 01:08:31,231
I'll have a hooker for him.
He'd like that.

837
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:32,733
Yeah.

838
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,359
Be safe.

839
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,361
You too, Davies.

840
01:08:44,204 --> 01:08:47,289
Sorry. We're still looking
for Campbell, but it looks bad.

841
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:19,196
Thank you, sir.

842
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:21,323
If there's anything else...

843
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:22,407
Room service.

844
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:23,784
Something exotic.

845
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,767
- Yeah?
- I found your Welshman.

846
01:09:50,478 --> 01:09:52,521
You sure it's him? I'm sure.

847
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:26,471
Fucking hell!

848
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:30,475
Get up. Get dressed. Move!

849
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:32,060
Look... Get up!

850
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:34,980
Don't say a word to anyone.
Do you understand?

851
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:38,191
You killed Simon McCann,
didn't you?

852
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:40,819
Yeah? And Campbell.

853
01:10:41,321 --> 01:10:42,404
Where is he, you fucker?

854
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:43,655
Never heard of him.

855
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:49,286
That all you got?

856
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:53,165
Yeah, Spike?

857
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:54,958
We got the Welshman.

858
01:10:55,043 --> 01:10:56,835
We're bringing him
to you now. Over.

859
01:10:57,712 --> 01:10:59,504
- Nice work, Pennock.
- Well done.

860
01:11:00,298 --> 01:11:02,507
I'm looking forward
to meeting the bastard.

861
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:10,724
Hey, Spike's gonna cut your dick off and
shove it in your mouth. You like that?

862
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:11,934
I like the sound of that, yeah.
Do you?

863
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:13,685
Yeah, I do. Get in the van.

864
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,854
Get in. Come on, get in!

865
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,364
Fuck me. You're kidding.

866
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:26,907
Come on. Get in!

867
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:34,790
There you are, you prick.

868
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:46,510
Oi!

869
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:52,474
Open up.

870
01:12:07,407 --> 01:12:08,407
Boss.

871
01:12:15,123 --> 01:12:16,248
What am I meant
to do with that?

872
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:18,417
He had this on him.

873
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:20,502
A phone number. Great work.

874
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:27,384
That pile of mincemeat was our best chance
of finding out who these bastards are.

875
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:30,679
Print him and trace
that bloody number.

876
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:34,391
You fucking idiots!

877
01:12:51,534 --> 01:12:52,534
Drop it.

878
01:12:53,661 --> 01:12:56,329
Left hand.
Put the gun on the floor.

879
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:06,757
Kick it to me.

880
01:13:10,303 --> 01:13:12,471
The Welshman, they were bringing
him to you. Where is he?

881
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:14,848
He didn't make it.

882
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:17,768
You? You do it?

883
01:13:18,019 --> 01:13:20,145
A truck.
He made a break for it.

884
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:21,646
He got lucky.

885
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:23,690
Would have been
very slow otherwise.

886
01:13:23,775 --> 01:13:25,692
Yeah, well that was
my fucking friend.

887
01:13:25,777 --> 01:13:27,402
Yeah, and McCann was mine.
And what about fucking...

888
01:13:27,487 --> 01:13:28,737
Campbell?

889
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:30,197
No.

890
01:13:31,032 --> 01:13:33,492
Davies. Meier. Harris.

891
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:37,079
McCann. Cregg. Campbell.

892
01:13:38,498 --> 01:13:39,539
Too many names on that list.

893
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:42,834
Don't go adding yours, Spike.

894
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:43,919
Inside.

895
01:13:47,799 --> 01:13:48,924
Who are you?

896
01:13:49,509 --> 01:13:50,926
Doesn't matter.

897
01:13:51,636 --> 01:13:52,969
After tonight, I don't exist.

898
01:13:53,346 --> 01:13:54,846
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

899
01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:56,181
It's over.

900
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:57,891
Done. You think so?

901
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:03,230
No uniform,
no war, not special.

902
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:06,358
You don't know what
to do with yourself.

903
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:08,693
Nobody knows
what to do with you.

904
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:10,403
Right? Wrong.

905
01:14:10,822 --> 01:14:13,240
You know my name
but you don't know me.

906
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:15,408
You have no idea
who you're fucking with.

907
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:16,618
Really?

908
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:20,580
Don't follow me.

909
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:23,083
Don't put your name
on that list.

910
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:36,263
The third confession.

911
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:45,438
The killers have been killed,

912
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,399
now you can go home.

913
01:14:49,569 --> 01:14:51,111
You can have your man.

914
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:54,739
You will get the money
when it's been checked.

915
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:56,867
Bring him out.

916
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:00,078
Bring him out!

917
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:06,293
Let me put...
I just wanna put my watch on.

918
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:07,794
What's the matter with you?

919
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,045
You all right? Yeah.

920
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:10,255
What's the plan?

921
01:15:10,715 --> 01:15:12,174
Get out of here.

922
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:14,134
Okay, sounds good.

923
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:20,974
I was sure you were gonna
get yourself killed, kiddo.

924
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,560
How in the hell did you do it?
How'd you pull it off?

925
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:24,769
I don't want to talk about it.

926
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:25,854
I get it.

927
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:28,315
Thank you. Not from me, but
from my kids for having a dad.

928
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:31,026
I could never thank you enough
for what you did. Never.

929
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:32,402
Yeah, you can.

930
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:34,946
You can get out of the business.
Be done with this shit.

931
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:36,031
No more soldiering.

932
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:37,199
No more mercenary work.

933
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:38,533
All right. Okay, okay.

934
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:41,453
I'm asking you, please.

935
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:43,580
Tell me you're done.

936
01:15:44,624 --> 01:15:46,541
I'm done. I'm out. Good.

937
01:15:47,627 --> 01:15:49,920
Stay out. Otherwise
all this is for nothing.

938
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:52,088
So, how are the Yankees doing?

939
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:20,825
You could have called.

940
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:23,536
You wouldn't have answered.

941
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:27,540
No. Sorry about that.

942
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:28,625
You're sorry?

943
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:30,877
It's me who should be sorry.

944
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,049
So it's over?

945
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:38,051
You going back again?

946
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:39,970
No.

947
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:45,725
And you're ready to
tell me everything?

948
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:49,020
Whatever you want to know.

949
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:53,191
Good.

950
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:56,528
Except I don't want to know.

951
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:59,030
Not any more.

952
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:03,868
I've...

953
01:17:04,287 --> 01:17:05,537
I've missed you, Danny.

954
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:11,751
I don't really care about the
past, I just care about now.

955
01:17:31,689 --> 01:17:33,481
Hey, boss. All right, Cal?

956
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:35,608
That phone number?
That was a business.

957
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:37,694
It's for some shit
travel agent.

958
01:17:38,029 --> 01:17:41,531
Runs mercenaries in and out of
every shithole in the world.

959
01:17:42,033 --> 01:17:43,033
Come in.

960
01:18:04,597 --> 01:18:05,597
Hello?

961
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:07,474
Hello, Danny.

962
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:12,562
How'd you get this number?

963
01:18:12,646 --> 01:18:15,774
Please, Danny, don't
insult my professionalism.

964
01:18:17,777 --> 01:18:18,777
What do you want?

965
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:21,112
We got a problem with the job.

966
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:25,950
The job's done. No.

967
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,619
You killed the wrong guy.

968
01:18:27,745 --> 01:18:28,787
There's one more to go.

969
01:18:28,913 --> 01:18:32,415
I busted my nuts setting this
job up and I want my 10%.

970
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:35,043
No, I did what I had to do.

971
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:36,461
Tell that to the Sheikh.

972
01:18:36,629 --> 01:18:38,713
He wants a London
meet with his son.

973
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:42,884
Check with your girlfriend before
you make any rash decisions. Eh?

974
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:55,665
What are you doing?
Come to bed.

975
01:20:02,173 --> 01:20:03,256
Come with me, Anne.

976
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:05,300
What? To Paris.

977
01:20:06,177 --> 01:20:08,470
You can wait for me there
while I'm in London.

978
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:10,722
Leave tomorrow.
Nothing's keeping you here, right?

979
01:20:11,682 --> 01:20:14,058
It's the middle of the night.
Anne. Anne!

980
01:20:14,852 --> 01:20:16,269
They know about you.

981
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:17,729
Who knows about me?

982
01:20:19,398 --> 01:20:20,690
And about us.

983
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:56,643
When will this be over?

984
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:58,186
Soon.

985
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,524
If all goes well.

986
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,400
It will, won't it?

987
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:34,389
Danny.

988
01:21:34,974 --> 01:21:36,099
Keep a good eye on her, huh?

989
01:21:36,517 --> 01:21:38,142
Listen, don't do this
on your own.

990
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:39,644
No other way.

991
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:41,271
Davies, Meier,
all this heat on you.

992
01:21:41,355 --> 01:21:43,940
Come on, let's just get in the car, we'll
go to London, be at the airport...

993
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:46,067
No. We have a deal, remember?

994
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:48,861
What do you mean?
You think I can't cut this, is that it?

995
01:21:48,988 --> 01:21:50,530
I mean, I'm not a
babysitter, come on!

996
01:21:50,614 --> 01:21:51,614
I need to know she's safe.

997
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:53,283
You're the only one I trust.

998
01:21:53,367 --> 01:21:55,994
This is bullshit. You could run,
both of you just go, come on.

999
01:21:56,078 --> 01:21:58,204
Everyone gets found.
You know that.

1000
01:21:58,831 --> 01:22:00,957
You're gonna get
yourself killed, kiddo.

1001
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:08,256
Thanks for doing this.

1002
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:10,633
You gotta be kidding me.

1003
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,815
Welcome back to London, sir.
Thank you, sir.

1004
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:08,149
You tell the old man he threatens her
again, I'll put it between his eyes.

1005
01:23:08,275 --> 01:23:12,320
Harris, the pilot, on his film he said
another soldier killed my brother.

1006
01:23:13,155 --> 01:23:14,447
He was winding us up.

1007
01:23:15,032 --> 01:23:16,449
He thought it was
some kind of a joke!

1008
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:17,533
This was just published.

1009
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:21,371
The author served with the SAS.

1010
01:23:22,915 --> 01:23:25,708
He describes an ambush where
he killed a guerilla leader.

1011
01:23:26,919 --> 01:23:28,920
Harris did not kill Hussain.

1012
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,217
You gave me his name.

1013
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:36,803
You said he was guilty.

1014
01:23:38,681 --> 01:23:40,098
Such is Allah's will.

1015
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:42,642
Allah's will?

1016
01:23:43,102 --> 01:23:44,936
You had me kill
an innocent man.

1017
01:23:45,938 --> 01:23:49,107
The book will be the real
killer's confession.

1018
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:52,110
My father...

1019
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:54,654
I know what your father needs.

1020
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:09,836
I need everything you can
get on a Ranulph Fiennes.

1021
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,671
Yeah, writer, ex-SAS.

1022
01:24:26,937 --> 01:24:27,937
What you got?

1023
01:24:28,605 --> 01:24:29,856
I got Fiennes.

1024
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:32,316
He's still pushing
his book on Oman.

1025
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:35,153
He'll be doing
a press bash on Tuesday.

1026
01:24:37,573 --> 01:24:39,532
Tuesday.
I know it's a bit short notice,

1027
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:41,492
but I'll be able to put
a crew together. Nah.

1028
01:24:42,786 --> 01:24:43,786
I'll do this on my own.

1029
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:45,830
Danny, are you sure?

1030
01:24:46,165 --> 01:24:47,165
It's just a phone call.

1031
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:50,251
I guess he's sure.

1032
01:24:55,466 --> 01:24:58,509
B-I-N-G fucking O.

1033
01:24:59,803 --> 01:25:02,305
I knew I'd find you,
you bastard.

1034
01:25:19,656 --> 01:25:20,656
Do you mind if I sit down?

1035
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:24,494
You look lonely.
You're Danny's friend.

1036
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:27,246
The famous Hunter.

1037
01:25:27,498 --> 01:25:28,498
He say nice things?

1038
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:30,082
What are you doing here?

1039
01:25:31,502 --> 01:25:32,502
Watching you.

1040
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:34,045
You should be with him.

1041
01:25:34,213 --> 01:25:36,422
I tried. It didn't work.

1042
01:25:36,799 --> 01:25:38,049
He wanted me here
to protect you.

1043
01:25:38,717 --> 01:25:40,218
And you look like
you needed protecting.

1044
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:42,094
From what?

1045
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:43,221
You.

1046
01:25:45,224 --> 01:25:48,059
You're thinking about him not coming back.
What happens then?

1047
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:52,730
No, I...
I have a wife, I know the look.

1048
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:57,401
We've known each other through
thick and thin, Danny and I.

1049
01:25:57,736 --> 01:26:00,404
Celine, my wife, she loves
him, my kids love him.

1050
01:26:00,697 --> 01:26:02,740
I mean,
wild animals like Danny.

1051
01:26:04,201 --> 01:26:05,201
Yeah.

1052
01:26:06,829 --> 01:26:09,330
I know Danny's going
to come back for you.

1053
01:26:10,249 --> 01:26:12,291
And when he does, you're
going to steal him away.

1054
01:26:12,376 --> 01:26:13,417
Huh?

1055
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:15,419
I don't know what the plan is.

1056
01:26:23,971 --> 01:26:25,888
I have a woman
to interrogate now.

1057
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:33,729
All right, look alive, lads.

1058
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:35,022
Boys.

1059
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:37,525
So this guy is good. Very good.

1060
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:41,404
If he senses something's up, he'll run
until you corner him and then he fights.

1061
01:26:41,488 --> 01:26:43,030
But now the gloves are off.

1062
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:45,199
This all fucking ends today.

1063
01:26:45,284 --> 01:26:46,576
All right,
everybody knows the rules.

1064
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:47,660
There are no rules.

1065
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:24,113
- Boss, he's out front.
- I think we're on.

1066
01:27:32,623 --> 01:27:33,873
This could be him.
Black leathers.

1067
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:35,499
Roger that.

1068
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:52,350
He just took the service stairs.
It has to be him.

1069
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:54,352
Just hold your positions.
We'll know soon enough.

1070
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:26,092
He's down, boss. We got him!
He stays alive.

1071
01:28:26,176 --> 01:28:28,219
Pennock, don't you touch him
until I'm there.

1072
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:29,387
Stay here.

1073
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:37,520
Stay there, you fucker.

1074
01:28:39,356 --> 01:28:41,065
Get his helmet off
before he chokes.

1075
01:28:47,072 --> 01:28:48,072
Shit.

1076
01:28:51,243 --> 01:28:53,202
Hands high, against the wall.

1077
01:28:56,415 --> 01:28:58,082
Okay, easy with that.

1078
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:40,291
Guys, our man's down.
Head for the roof.

1079
01:30:07,736 --> 01:30:09,570
Pennock, head for the roof.

1080
01:30:10,447 --> 01:30:12,031
We're on our way up now, boss.

1081
01:30:12,115 --> 01:30:13,365
Come on, move!

1082
01:30:38,725 --> 01:30:40,017
He jumped! He jumped!

1083
01:31:12,134 --> 01:31:13,717
Come on, come on,
he's on the move. Let's go!

1084
01:31:49,462 --> 01:31:50,504
Aah!

1085
01:31:59,598 --> 01:32:00,681
Pennock?

1086
01:32:02,684 --> 01:32:03,767
Don't you do it.

1087
01:32:07,272 --> 01:32:09,273
There's no sign
of him up here, boss.

1088
01:32:09,357 --> 01:32:11,233
I can see all the way
to the river.

1089
01:32:11,318 --> 01:32:12,818
He's gone.

1090
01:32:24,456 --> 01:32:25,456
Shit.

1091
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:28,459
Move and you're dead.

1092
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:32,963
Right, let's go, let's go.

1093
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:38,469
Get in.

1094
01:32:58,823 --> 01:32:59,823
What is this?

1095
01:33:03,370 --> 01:33:04,662
That's for Campbell.

1096
01:33:06,665 --> 01:33:08,958
- And that's for Cregg.
- You finished?

1097
01:33:10,669 --> 01:33:12,253
We haven't even started.

1098
01:33:12,337 --> 01:33:13,587
Take the hood off.

1099
01:33:15,757 --> 01:33:17,091
Wait outside, boys.

1100
01:33:21,721 --> 01:33:24,056
Save a little bit for us, boss.

1101
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:30,479
So why is he still alive?
Why didn't you kill him?

1102
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:32,898
Is that what you
would have done?

1103
01:33:33,858 --> 01:33:34,942
I thought you were
the good guys.

1104
01:33:35,694 --> 01:33:36,694
Who are you?

1105
01:33:37,529 --> 01:33:38,696
Who do you work for?

1106
01:33:39,739 --> 01:33:41,031
You and I got a lot in common.

1107
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:43,450
Really? You think so?

1108
01:33:44,452 --> 01:33:47,121
So, you're sitting there,
tied to a chair

1109
01:33:47,205 --> 01:33:49,415
and I'm standing here
with a gun in my hand.

1110
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:52,876
Now you tell me what the
fuck this was all about.

1111
01:33:54,504 --> 01:33:55,504
"Was?"

1112
01:33:57,382 --> 01:33:58,382
You think this is over?

1113
01:33:59,217 --> 01:34:00,676
There'll be somebody else.

1114
01:34:01,177 --> 01:34:02,177
Your boy, Fiennes,
is gonna die.

1115
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:14,356
Go on, pull the trigger.

1116
01:34:14,441 --> 01:34:15,566
Kill me and you kill Fiennes.

1117
01:34:16,234 --> 01:34:17,443
They won't stop
till they get him.

1118
01:34:17,527 --> 01:34:19,445
I stopped you, I'll stop them.

1119
01:34:19,529 --> 01:34:20,571
I didn't want to kill him.

1120
01:34:21,448 --> 01:34:22,448
They will.

1121
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:26,827
You put that in the right
hands, this thing's over.

1122
01:34:26,911 --> 01:34:27,911
The camera? Why?

1123
01:34:27,996 --> 01:34:29,121
Proof.

1124
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:31,665
Evidence that he's dead.

1125
01:34:33,418 --> 01:34:35,794
It's the only way
you'll save him.

1126
01:34:36,254 --> 01:34:39,006
You tell me I'll walk, I'll tell you
who's behind this and where to find him.

1127
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:43,093
Okay.

1128
01:34:44,596 --> 01:34:45,763
You walk.

1129
01:34:47,599 --> 01:34:49,475
Sheikh Amr bin Issa.

1130
01:34:50,185 --> 01:34:51,810
You'll find him in Oman.

1131
01:34:51,895 --> 01:34:53,771
Why? The war.

1132
01:34:55,815 --> 01:34:57,941
They killed three of his sons.

1133
01:35:04,574 --> 01:35:05,574
No.

1134
01:35:14,459 --> 01:35:15,667
Some good guy, eh?

1135
01:35:23,718 --> 01:35:24,718
Drop it.

1136
01:35:32,018 --> 01:35:33,018
Inside.

1137
01:35:40,110 --> 01:35:41,151
Beside him.

1138
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:42,820
On your knees.

1139
01:35:53,498 --> 01:35:54,915
You were set up.

1140
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:57,334
That's what we
love about you lot.

1141
01:35:58,294 --> 01:35:59,795
You only care about the action.

1142
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:03,715
Never think about what you
might really be fighting for.

1143
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:06,176
Or who.

1144
01:36:07,887 --> 01:36:10,097
Never see the big picture.

1145
01:36:14,519 --> 01:36:16,937
You're the one that was set up.

1146
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:19,523
He just wouldn't
get out of the way.

1147
01:36:20,984 --> 01:36:24,319
Her Majesty's government
doesn't like secret societies.

1148
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:28,157
Particularly when they get
in the way of our interests.

1149
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:33,328
Do you know how much oil that pathetic
crust of desert is floating on?

1150
01:36:33,538 --> 01:36:34,663
Do you know what those
contracts are worth?

1151
01:36:34,747 --> 01:36:36,081
Three men's lives.

1152
01:36:36,166 --> 01:36:40,377
That's right.

1153
01:36:41,171 --> 01:36:42,421
We deliver the killers.

1154
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:43,714
Son Number 4 goes home

1155
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:46,049
and when Sheikhy
re-ups the contracts,

1156
01:36:46,134 --> 01:36:47,593
we get favorable consideration.

1157
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:50,637
A bargain.
You bastard, you're a...

1158
01:36:50,722 --> 01:36:51,722
Patriot.

1159
01:36:52,056 --> 01:36:55,851
Who serves his country as those
three men did with their deaths.

1160
01:36:55,935 --> 01:36:56,935
As you will with yours.

1161
01:38:12,345 --> 01:38:13,428
Fuck.

1162
01:38:26,985 --> 01:38:28,652
There she is.

1163
01:38:28,945 --> 01:38:30,946
Danny might've
dropped off the radar,

1164
01:38:31,072 --> 01:38:32,656
but one thing's for sure.

1165
01:38:33,157 --> 01:38:34,741
He'll come back for her.

1166
01:38:35,118 --> 01:38:40,038
He'll come through that door with
$6 million and she won't be there.

1167
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:42,791
Who don't you
screw out of his 10%?

1168
01:38:42,875 --> 01:38:44,334
Yours truly.

1169
01:38:45,837 --> 01:38:47,004
Boss.

1170
01:38:51,009 --> 01:38:52,050
Deal with him.

1171
01:40:09,379 --> 01:40:10,462
It wasn't personal.

1172
01:40:12,131 --> 01:40:13,173
Just business.

1173
01:40:14,884 --> 01:40:16,259
You played us.

1174
01:40:17,303 --> 01:40:18,595
I don't care why.

1175
01:40:19,222 --> 01:40:21,765
But if ever a lying piece of
shit needed killing, it was you.

1176
01:40:26,437 --> 01:40:27,562
Game's over.

1177
01:40:28,064 --> 01:40:30,023
You know,
I wouldn't have hurt her.

1178
01:40:30,108 --> 01:40:31,692
I just wanted my cut.

1179
01:40:31,776 --> 01:40:32,776
She was only collateral.

1180
01:40:41,244 --> 01:40:42,327
If you go after them,

1181
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:45,288
I'll find you.

1182
01:40:46,332 --> 01:40:48,333
Remember, everybody gets found.

1183
01:40:48,543 --> 01:40:49,876
Even you.

1184
01:41:05,184 --> 01:41:06,977
You gotta get those
photos to that old bastard

1185
01:41:07,103 --> 01:41:08,812
to finish this thing for
good, you hear, kiddo?

1186
01:41:08,896 --> 01:41:09,938
That's why I'm here.

1187
01:41:10,314 --> 01:41:11,606
What about you?

1188
01:41:11,983 --> 01:41:13,984
Babysitting's over, kiddo.

1189
01:41:14,986 --> 01:41:16,236
Who says? I say.

1190
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:17,988
She's safe. You're the one
taking the chances now.

1191
01:41:18,114 --> 01:41:19,614
Come on. "Come on?"

1192
01:41:19,991 --> 01:41:21,408
You walked into
a trap last time.

1193
01:41:21,492 --> 01:41:23,160
You think I'm going to
let you do that again?

1194
01:41:23,244 --> 01:41:24,911
I told your girl you were going
to be coming back to her.

1195
01:41:24,996 --> 01:41:26,163
You want to make
a liar out of me?

1196
01:41:26,247 --> 01:41:27,581
You know, you were supposed
to be guarding her,

1197
01:41:27,665 --> 01:41:28,790
not interviewing her.

1198
01:41:28,875 --> 01:41:32,043
Well, I was always a sucker for
a pretty face, no denying that.

1199
01:41:32,128 --> 01:41:34,212
She's a keeper,
that's for sure.

1200
01:41:35,465 --> 01:41:37,174
She doesn't know, does she?

1201
01:41:37,675 --> 01:41:39,217
Some. Yeah.

1202
01:41:39,343 --> 01:41:41,052
It's going to be tough.
My old man used to say,

1203
01:41:41,137 --> 01:41:42,929
"Life's like licking
honey from a thorn."

1204
01:41:43,014 --> 01:41:44,014
Yeah, what does that mean?

1205
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:46,516
Something about good times
and bad times.

1206
01:41:46,976 --> 01:41:49,811
Seems like it's been all thorns
for us lately. Both of us.

1207
01:41:50,188 --> 01:41:51,938
All right, let's finish this.

1208
01:41:52,023 --> 01:41:53,398
I'll be top cover.

1209
01:41:53,775 --> 01:41:55,025
Anything goes wrong,

1210
01:41:55,151 --> 01:41:57,444
I'm coming in.
Hey, look, the Sheikh wants this over.

1211
01:41:57,528 --> 01:41:58,612
It's in, hand over
the photos, and out.

1212
01:41:58,696 --> 01:41:59,696
Yeah? Yeah.

1213
01:41:59,781 --> 01:42:00,864
There isn't going
to be a problem.

1214
01:42:02,158 --> 01:42:04,242
From your mouth to God's ears.

1215
01:42:04,327 --> 01:42:06,077
Don't move till I give
the all-clear, okay?

1216
01:42:27,141 --> 01:42:28,141
Who are you?

1217
01:42:29,227 --> 01:42:30,227
What do you want?

1218
01:42:33,397 --> 01:42:34,397
For the Sheikh.

1219
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,443
I have to see it
placed in his hands.

1220
01:42:50,957 --> 01:42:52,791
Take these to my people.

1221
01:42:53,459 --> 01:42:54,918
Show them what I have done.

1222
01:42:58,047 --> 01:42:59,798
I have a message
for the Sheikh.

1223
01:43:06,681 --> 01:43:07,848
He's still alive.

1224
01:43:11,936 --> 01:43:12,936
They're fakes.

1225
01:43:16,941 --> 01:43:18,316
But this is going to end.

1226
01:43:33,165 --> 01:43:34,291
I don't care.

1227
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:38,420
What'll I do

1228
01:43:40,381 --> 01:43:43,133
in that godforsaken desert?

1229
01:43:48,681 --> 01:43:49,806
Haven't you
forgotten something?

1230
01:44:07,992 --> 01:44:09,743
Hold it, hold it,
stay where you are.

1231
01:44:09,827 --> 01:44:11,453
Something's not right here.

1232
01:44:19,128 --> 01:44:20,462
You seeing this?

1233
01:44:20,546 --> 01:44:21,796
Yeah, I see it.

1234
01:44:28,012 --> 01:44:29,763
So we're in the wrong place.

1235
01:44:49,283 --> 01:44:50,533
Let's go! Let's go!

1236
01:45:31,158 --> 01:45:32,784
Relax, I only killed the car.

1237
01:46:16,412 --> 01:46:17,412
You again!

1238
01:46:26,630 --> 01:46:27,964
Back at the palace,

1239
01:46:28,924 --> 01:46:30,258
what happened in there?

1240
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:34,054
He was there, waiting
for a message from you.

1241
01:46:34,138 --> 01:46:35,388
I was the messenger.

1242
01:46:36,015 --> 01:46:37,098
And?

1243
01:46:37,183 --> 01:46:38,433
What do you think?

1244
01:46:39,185 --> 01:46:41,102
His boy in there
didn't give a shit.

1245
01:46:41,187 --> 01:46:43,855
He's not going back to the desert,
so there'll be no oil contracts.

1246
01:46:45,357 --> 01:46:46,566
It was all for nothing.

1247
01:46:47,026 --> 01:46:48,026
Is that right?

1248
01:47:01,457 --> 01:47:02,999
And the winner is.

1249
01:47:04,376 --> 01:47:05,835
So that's what
this is all about.

1250
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:08,254
Yeah, it's all hookers
and blow from here on in.

1251
01:47:09,048 --> 01:47:10,048
You just don't get it, do you?

1252
01:47:13,511 --> 01:47:14,511
Ditch it.

1253
01:47:14,595 --> 01:47:15,762
You sure?

1254
01:47:16,263 --> 01:47:17,472
Ditch it.

1255
01:47:19,683 --> 01:47:21,142
I gotta cover my expenses.

1256
01:47:23,562 --> 01:47:24,979
You can't go back to England.

1257
01:47:25,064 --> 01:47:26,356
Not after killing that spook.

1258
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:27,607
Who the fuck are you?

1259
01:47:27,691 --> 01:47:29,692
Who, me?
The voice of experience.

1260
01:47:30,277 --> 01:47:31,945
Where are you going to go?
What are you going to do?

1261
01:47:32,029 --> 01:47:33,029
You're going to need this.

1262
01:47:33,781 --> 01:47:35,532
New name, new face, new papers.

1263
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:38,535
Expensive. You'll see.

1264
01:47:48,129 --> 01:47:49,379
Damn shame.

1265
01:47:53,592 --> 01:47:54,884
You think you get
to just walk away?

1266
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:57,804
Nobody walks away.

1267
01:47:58,889 --> 01:48:00,932
Not me or you, none of us.

1268
01:48:01,809 --> 01:48:03,935
The old man you just killed,

1269
01:48:04,895 --> 01:48:07,730
he told me a war isn't over
until both sides say it is.

1270
01:48:08,232 --> 01:48:10,483
Well, I'm telling you now,
this is over for me.

1271
01:48:10,818 --> 01:48:13,945
Really? And what? You want me to say, "Me,
too," and then it's happy ever after?

1272
01:48:14,405 --> 01:48:15,405
Your choice.

1273
01:48:16,073 --> 01:48:18,074
You know, when I got this,
they told me my war was over.

1274
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:19,701
I told them they
were full of shit.

1275
01:48:19,785 --> 01:48:20,785
Now I'm telling it to you.

1276
01:48:21,912 --> 01:48:23,288
Let it go.

1277
01:48:30,212 --> 01:48:31,629
So where are you going?

1278
01:48:31,714 --> 01:48:33,256
What, are you planning a visit?

1279
01:48:33,632 --> 01:48:34,757
You never know.

1280
01:48:37,845 --> 01:48:38,845
You come.

1281
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:40,847
I'll be waiting.

1282
01:48:47,396 --> 01:48:49,189
We'll call you a cab
from the airport.

1283
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:10,460
Hey.

1284
01:49:12,129 --> 01:49:13,129
Aren't you Anne Frazer?

1285
01:49:13,923 --> 01:49:15,173
The girl with those
weird gumboots?

1286
01:49:18,052 --> 01:49:20,345
Are you Danny Bryce,
the boy who went away?

1287
01:49:20,429 --> 01:49:21,888
Yeah.

1288
01:49:21,972 --> 01:49:23,264
I'm back.

1289
01:49:23,349 --> 01:49:24,432
Where you headed?

1290
01:49:26,268 --> 01:49:27,644
I don't know.

1291
01:49:27,728 --> 01:49:28,728
Me, neither.

1292
01:49:29,355 --> 01:49:30,480
Want to come along?
