1
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,890


2
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,060


3
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,300


4
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,840


5
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,850


6
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,880
HUNTER: Hey, kiddo, what are you doing?

7
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,360
I buy you a fancy Mexican meal and you're feeding it to a mutt.

8
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,300
Real fancy.

9
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,500
You have any idea what that is?

10
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:37,560
What?

11
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,800
Tree chicken.

12
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,030
What? That's what the locals call it.

13
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,910
Colds, headaches, hangovers, cures anything.

14
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,100
Iguana. That's what they say.

15
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,980
What about indigestion?

16
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,580
Fuckin' iguana taco.

17
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,020
Yeah, well, you had it in Salvador.

18
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,950
Yeah, and that was shit.

19
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,650
What about Angola? The food was good there, right?

20
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,890
Shit.

21
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,620
Yeah, Rhodesia?

22
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,200
Shit.

23
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,270
Hamburg? Shit.

24
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,660
So if it's not New York, it's...

25
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,290
You got it. Shit.

26
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,370
Look at you wasting away.

27
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,470
We got to get a job in New York.

28
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,080
That won't be a problem. Plenty of assholes there.

29
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,800
Time to move, kiddo.

30
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,840


31
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,670
MEIER: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,530
Fuck!

33
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,210
Stay down!

34
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,640
HUNTER: Stay down, kid.

35
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:30,960
What happened?

36
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,300
There was a kid in the car.What?

37
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,270
There was a kid in the car.

38
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,400
Go, go, go, go!

39
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,510
Fuck!

40
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,280
I'm done with this. I'm finished.

41
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,600
I can't do this anymore.

42
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,090
I can't do this.

43
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:10,900


44
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,570


45
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:22,820


46
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,260
Oh, shit!

47
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,640
Shit!

48
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:27,580


49
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,620
AGENT: Danny, get in.

50
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,610
These camel jockeys have got diseases I don't wanna think about.

51
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,590
Where is he?

52
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,930
The client still has him.

53
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,300
What client?

54
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,440
We're going there now.

55
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,400
Okay, drive.

56
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,680
AGENT: So the client's an oil sheikh, no less.

57
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,490
He used to rule some huge stretch of desert till his tribe kicked him out.

58
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,030
Been living here in exile ever since.

59
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,930
Anyway, Sheikhy was loaded and he wanted a job done.

60
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,470
Hunter took the contract, then he ran.

61
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,570
They caught him at the airport.

62
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:20,770
And?

63
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,230
You know the rest. You got the package.

64
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,250
Yeah, I got it.

65
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,950
What's the job? Just came with a price tag, no details. Hunter took it cold.

66
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,350
Why would he do that?

67
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:37,080
Six million dollars. A big score, Danny.

68
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,820
Too bloody big for Hunter.

69
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,120
Yeah. Why'd you offer it to him?

70
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,390
He wanted the money. And you were out, remember?

71
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,990
Yeah. Still am.

72
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,930
I'm done with killing.

73
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,540
Yeah, well, maybe killing ain't done with you.

74
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,710
Hunter needs the old Danny, the best in the biz.

75
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,170
The one with balls of steel. You remember him, right?

76
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:01,290
Look, it comes down to this.

77
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,340
You don't do this job, Hunter's a dead man.

78
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,650
They're waiting for you.

79
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,640
This way.

80
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,610
SHEIKH AMR: He's waiting for his eyes to adjust.

81
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,450
Be careful around this one, boy.

82
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,110
My son forgets the ways of the desert.

83
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,420
Since our war against the Sultan, all he has had of his homeland

84
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,500
is this paint. Plaster.

85
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:30,300
My first son, Hussain, was slaughtered here.

86
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,030
Shot before his children.

87
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,700
And here, at the Battle of Mirbat,

88
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:46,790
his brother, Salim, was wounded and then killed. Murdered.

89
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:54,720
And then my third son was taken from me. Ali.

90
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,220
Hunted down and slaughtered.

91
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,860
The law of the desert says the blood of the victim

92
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:09,170
must be washed away by the blood of the Killers.

93
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,210
But I refused revenge

94
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,440
 and saved my last son, Bakhait, from the war.

95
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,450
So I was exiled to this desert.

96
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:22,450
I have wealth, power.

97
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,750
But rich men die, too.

98
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,820
When I die,

99
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,230
I want Bakhait to go home to my tribe.

100
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,290
But for that to happen,

101
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,490
the killers of my sons must be killed.

102
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,700
You don't need me or Hunter for this.

103
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,460
You got all the men you need.

104
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,130
What use would my men be in England?

105
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,470
England?

106
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,870
The English sent their fiercest

107
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,110
dogs to kill for the Sultan's oil.

108
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,420
The SAS?

109
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:57,450
Yes. Their glorious special forces.

110
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,350


111
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,050
It was a war. It was not England's war.

112
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,130
They came to my land, murdered my sons,

113
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,700
 now they will face my law.

114
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,100
The doctors say I have six months left to live.

115
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,760
You must avenge my sons before I die

116
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,100
or your friend will die with me.

117
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,370
I don't care how you kill the Killers.

118
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,210
But they will admit their guilt on tape,

119
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,910
and their deaths must look like accidents.

120
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,920
This must not lead back to my son.

121
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,250
So go, show the English

122
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:34,830
a war isn't over till both sides say it is.

123
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,390
I wanna see Hunter.

124
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:59,140
Oh, Danny! No, Danny. No, no, no, no. No.

125
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,620
What are you doing here? Get out of here.

126
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,490
You all right?

127
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,250
Am I all right? Yeah, I'm all right.

128
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,190
You gotta go. Get away from here. Go, go, go, go.

129
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:14,200
I'm not here for you anyway. I was thinking about the girls and Celine.

130
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,270
Me, too. Me, too.

131
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,030
(CHUCKLES) What's that supposed to mean?

132
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,870
It's tough putting food on the table.

133
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,200
What you feeding 'em? Six million, no questions?

134
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:25,970
Well.

135
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,910
So you must've known that was a bullshit job.

136
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,510
Yeah, I knew. Fuckin' SAS, a one-way ticket for sure.

137
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,310
Well, you took the job, and I'm not leaving you here.

138
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,790
Give this man a drink.

139
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,030
I missed you.

140
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:49,690
I didn't miss you.

141
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,770
Every day you were out of this game was a good day for me.

142
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,400
I was proud of you when you got out.

143
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,270
Stay out.

144
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,570
Too late.

145
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,180
You should have stayed away.

146
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,880
Or run faster.

147
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,240
Son of a bitch!

148
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,340
What are you doing? Let me get my watch back.

149
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,510
Go, go!

150
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,820
Go, go, get the door!

151
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,780
Get the door!

152
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,230
Give me the gun.

153
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,910
Bravo! Bravo!

154
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,340
If you need to be shot, I'll happily oblige.

155
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,020
I'm sorry, kiddo.

156
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,720
My father needs him alive.

157
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,900
Nice try.

158
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,590
 You know they'd have found you.

159
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,140
Everybody gets found.

160
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:49,970
You knew.

161
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,280
My gut tells me you knew the target and you knew Hunter wouldn't take it.

162
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,580
You used him as bait.

163
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,690
That's a lot of angles, Danny.

164
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,790
Do you think I'm that smart?

165
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,090
Get out.

166
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,520
 And you. Out.

167
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,080
ANNE: We missed you at the dance last night.

168
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,480
DANNY: I'm not much of a dancer.

169
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,590
Besides, I'm still trying to find out how much house is under this.

170
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,490
Right, big plans.

171
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,730
Yeah, maybe too big.

172
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,040
You don't remember me, do you?

173
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,470
Yeah, well, it's been a while.

174
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,980
I'm Anne Frazer.

175
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,180
Anne Frazer?

176
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,720
Anne had red hair full of grass.

177
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,150
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

178
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,950
And weird red gumboots.

179
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,930
With eyes on them. (LAUGHS) Oh, my God!

180
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,830


181
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,510
Oi! You owe me 50 quid.

182
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,310
Told you he'd be back, didn't I?

183
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,280
We missed you. Yeah?

184
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,910
Here I am.

185
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,120
DAVIES: All right, then, you want some?

186
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,230
Yeah, mate, you still got it. Still got that edge.

187
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,730
You're a real killer.

188
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,040
DANNY: Come on, let's talk. (GROANS)

189
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,410
DAVIES: While you were away, you didn't start a family, did you?

190
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,570
No.

191
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,510
So no one's depending on you?

192
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,550
Only Hunter.

193
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,310
'Cause one,

194
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,510
 you're going after the SAS.

195
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,630
They're a paranoid bunch. They always got their back up.

196
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,850
Two, you need info on Oman.

197
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,900
No one talks about Oman.

198
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,230
They went in there as advisors and ended up fighting the fucking war. Real hush-hush,

199
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,770
semi-mercenary stuff.

200
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,000
Three, you need confessions.

201
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,110
They're trained to resist torture

202
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,300
so no matter what you say or do, they'll say nothing.

203
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,100
And four, Danny,

204
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,470
this is the best special forces regiment in the world.

205
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:35,650
They make the Navy Seals look like a bunch of cupcakes.

206
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,270
And not only that,

207
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,540
you're trying to take down three of their geezers

208
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,550
and make it look like an accident.

209
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,050
All I'm asking is give it some thought.

210
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,620
Take a day, more if you want. I'm going anyway.

211
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,220
Of course I'm in, you silly bastard.

212
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,830
It's what we do, right?

213
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,700
Anyway, I've got a score to settle with them.

214
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,320
Tried out for them when I was in the Paras.

215
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,700
Did Hereford, the whole fucking lot.

216
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,270
MEIER: What, and they wouldn't have you?

217
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,470
(SIGHS) You want this bottle shoved up your arse?

218
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,630
Are you upset? Would you like a lolly?

219
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,240
I'd love a lolly.

220
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,810
MEIER: Strawberry or fuck you?

221
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,350
Meier.

222
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,610
In.

223
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,810
Why?

224
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,240
Ah, six million reasons.

225
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,120
So what's the split?

226
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,120
After the Agent takes his slice, 50-50 between you two.

227
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,450
50-50? How about you?

228
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,690
I'm in this for Hunter.

229
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,260
How wonderfully touching.

230
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,630
Touching, but fuckin' stupid.

231
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,340
The Sheikh could only ID one of the killers.

232
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,770
I need you to come up with the names on the other two.

233
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,170
Start with the one they killed at Mirbat.

234
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,400
So the one target we do have is Steven Douglas Harris.

235
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,140
Stayed on in Oman after the war.

236
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,840
Ended up flying choppers for the Sultan's armed forces.

237
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,540
Great. A juice junkie.

238
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,920
Me and Meier'll head there to track him down.

239
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,020
Boys? Danny.

240
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,080
Meier.

241
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:02,860


242
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,970
MAN: What the fuck!

243
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,970


244
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,880
MAN: Harris!

245
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,650
Harris, you prick! Fuck off!

246
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,990
Well, I hope the buggers like sand in their burgers, huh?

247
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,930
White Range Rover coming your way. It's Harris.

248
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,220
SANDY: What are you doing?

249
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,460
Come on, have a go. No.

250
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,220
Come on. I'm not.

251
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,490
Have a go. Look.

252
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,960
Just aim and shoot. Go! Here we go!

253
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,740
Oh, you horny git! Come on.

254
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:19,260
No. Come on. (LAUGHS) Come on.

255
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,370


256
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,580
DAVIES: All right, ladies, you can throw your knickers if you want.

257
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,840
Go on, you cheeky bugger!

258
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,420
MAN: You serve in Oman? At Mirbat.

259
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,250
That was a day, wasn't it?

260
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,520
What about Mirbat? That was a right mess, eh?

261
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,630
Wasn't good.

262
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,490
I had a mate there.

263
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,270


264
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,310
DIANE: Spike, get that quick. Yeah, all right, all right.

265
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,680
Bollocks.

266
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,710
Hello?

267
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,820
Spikey, it's Bazza.

268
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:09,890
God's sake! I'm unplugging that bloody thing next time, and I mean it.

269
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,860
Yeah, I'm onto this bloke here, right.

270
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:16,690
He was in the Bear earlier pumping some SAS lads for info on Mirbat.

271
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,890
Mirbat. And?

272
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,360
He says he's Welsh. But he don't sound it.

273
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,490
I don't know. Maybe I'm being a bit paranoid, but...

274
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:26,540
Hey, just 'cause you're being paranoid, doesn't mean to say they're not out to get you.

275
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:30,870
All right, mate, give me what you've got.

276
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:31,770
Okay.

277
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,710
Put one of my Locals onto him.

278
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,370
SPIKE: The Omani Embassy.

279
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:07,500
Our Local followed him into the visa section.

280
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:11,310
Says he's Welsh, calls himself Mr. Jones.

281
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,940
We lost him after he left.

282
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,520
FITZ: Lost him? How come?

283
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,680
He never came back to his car. Stolen.

284
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,520
Anyhow, he flies to Oman in four days.

285
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,720
I'd like permission to send one of my boys out there to tail him.

286
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,330
This was definitely some kind of recce.

287
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,760
That was a dirty war. What we did there was questionable.

288
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,730
Oman is a bloody hornet's nest.

289
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,890
Right. And if this bugger is poking at it,

290
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,270
I want to know who he is. I say we send a Local.

291
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:37,100
Any objections?

292
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,070
Noted.

293
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,540
 We'll leave you to choose the right man.

294
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,170
I'd also like it noted that we are ex-SAS.

295
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,250
The men we protect are ex-SAS.

296
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,540
And you, Spike,

297
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:49,590
though you hate to admit it, are ex-SAS.

298
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,250
JUSTICE: Remember, we're businessmen and bankers now.

299
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,420
What we do here is illegal.

300
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,550
We can leave no trace of our activities.

301
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,190
That's why we're called The Feather Men,

302
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:04,270
'cause our touch is light.

303
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,700
THE DON: Now, Spike's a good man.

304
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,470
Day the SAS lost him, they lost a good soldier.

305
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,370
COMMANDER B: Yes, but the problem is he thinks he's still in the SAS.

306
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,310
Well, someone has to do the dirty work.

307
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,310
None of us want blood on our pinstripes.

308
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,480
Listen, I've got no problem with blood.

309
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,250
What worries me is ink.

310
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,990
Make sure he keeps us out of the newspapers.

311
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:26,720
MARTIN: What's doing, boss?

312
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,520
Your Arabic's still good, right?

313
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,220
Good enough. You're going to Oman.

314
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,560
I've got a bloke I want you to tail out there.

315
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,030
You lucky bastard!

316
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,300
You know what? You're gorgeous.

317
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,940
Where are you staying?

318
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,380
I'm staying at the Hilton.

319
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,750
As a matter of fact, so am I. What room are you in?

320
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,250
Why? Would you like to know?

321
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,150
Love to.

322
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,450
AIR HOSTESS: You are smooth.

323
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,610
DAVIES: What are we doing out here, then, in the middle of nowhere?

324
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,300
MEIER: Well, I ask him to go hide it, he hides it.

325
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,910
Could've been your asshole, consider yourself lucky.

326
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,280
Shut it, Meier.

327
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,810
Appreciate it, thank you.

328
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,580
These tiles are an exact match to the shower step?

329
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,460
Hundred percent.

330
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,560
Harris comes home, parks the car. It's been a hard day.

331
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,630
I'll have a shower. Whoops.

332
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:44,430
He slips on the shampoo,

333
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:45,930
hits the corner of the step with his occiput.

334
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,700
Case closed. Get out of it.

335
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:52,940
You boys are going about this all wrong. That bird he's screwing is married.

336
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,280
Why don't we just pop 'em both and

337
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,780
make it look like her husband did it.

338
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:59,210
Pop 'em both? What's she ever done?

339
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,410
It's Harris we're after.

340
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,350
Poor bastard.

341
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,920
Ten years after the war, he cops it for doing something he was ordered to do.

342
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,750
He knew what he was doing when he joined the club.

343
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:09,790
Yeah, what club?

344
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,420
The killing club.

345
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,090
It could be you or me. Yeah, but it's not...

346
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,360
I'm just glad I never killed a raghead.

347
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,270
No offense, my son.

348
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,630
Let's get this done.

349
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:22,970
MEIER: Excuse my friend. He's a royal asshole.

350
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:33,580
Shit!

351
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,620
DAVIES: Where's he gonna run? It's the middle of the fuckin' desert.

352
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,140
Son of a...

353
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:56,540
Meier,

354
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,400
cut him off at the next shaft!

355
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,980
Let's go, let's go.

356
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,480
Where is he?

357
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,050
Shh.

358
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,390
DAVIES: Let's get out here. Fuckin' hell!

359
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,190
MEIER: So what, now somebody's on our ass?

360
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,500
DANNY: We should move right away.

361
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,630
We'll set up Harris' interview for tomorrow.

362
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,870
Davies, you make sure his girl doesn't show.

363
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,640
She has nothing to do with this.

364
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,990
Wanker!

365
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:38,840
DANNY: We're military historians. I'll do the talking, all right?

366
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,440
Well, it's 5:00 somewhere, isn't it?

367
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,980
So where's this documentary gonna be shown, then?

368
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,450
On the telly?

369
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,310
The chair.

370
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,850
Those bastards in C Company put this together. Hmm?

371
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:24,780
HARRIS: What's the matter?

372
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,020
They didn't like sand in their burgers?

373
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,830
Eh? Hello, boys. I'm not saying a word

374
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,520
till I see my lawyer.

375
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,500
Think back. The village of Qum.

376
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,350
You killed a guerilla commander.

377
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:41,130
His name was Hussain bin Amr. Do you admit it?

378
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:49,280
Fuck off! You're kidding, right?

379
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,340
You commanded a company there.

380
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,140
Yeah, I led a company on that op, sure.

381
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,810
And you assassinated Hussain bin Amr.

382
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,720
There were witnesses.

383
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:04,050
You dropped him in front of his family.

384
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,500
All right, you got me. I did it. Hmm?

385
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,470
Fuck you!

386
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,400
Good one. Now untie me.

387
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,010
Get up.

388
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,700
Hey! Piss off!

389
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,140
We have what we need.

390
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:27,010
What if I told you somebody else dropped your guerilla commander?

391
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,840
His name is...

392
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,850
I can't remember.

393
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:34,950
But he's writing a book about the whole Oman gig.

394
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,820
You might find it in there.

395
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,590
If you could read. (LAUGHS)

396
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,390
To the bathroom.

397
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:44,100
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

398
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,400
It's coming back to me, looking at your fucking face.

399
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,700
His name is Captain R. Sole! A-R-S-E H-O-L-E.

400
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,940
Shut up.

401
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,270
You're fucking dead, yeah?

402
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,080
On your knees.

403
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,880
Fucking queers! Serves you fucking right!

404
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:03,320
Head down. Get your fuckin' hands off me, you queer!

405
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,080
You're fuckin' kidding me.

406
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:05,620
DANNY: Hold him still.

407
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,620
If I find you, I'll put your fuckin' head in the toilet bowl.

408
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,020
Poor fucker.

409
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,410
Jay!

410
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:26,430
I need money for the taxi. I had to take a taxi. I had a flat.

411
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:43,560
HARRIS: Fuck you! (SCREAMS)

412
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,730
Case closed.

413
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:04,980
Thank you.

414
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,360
WOMAN OVER RADIO: ... tells of a dramatic 12-hour rescue operation

415
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:16,190
to save the crew of Radio Caroline.

416
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,060
The pirate radio ship sank the...

417
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:24,130
It seems your friend did what you couldn't.

418
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,640
Wouldn't.

419
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,080
Wouldn't, couldn't. He's avenged Hussain.

420
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,270
Good news for the old man, not for you.

421
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:34,400
What do you mean?

422
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:37,480
Three brothers dead. Rotting in the sand.

423
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,940
You didn't wanna get revenge yourself?

424
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:43,680
Scared of getting your hands dirty?

425
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,960
Better get used to it.

426
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,460
No palace where you're going.

427
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,720
A tent and a hole to shit in.

428
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,760
He's your worst nightmare and he's gonna do it.

429
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,900
And when he does, you're out of here.

430
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,470
When I find you in that desert,

431
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,800
I pray God keeps my aim...

432
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,640
...true.

433
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,080
Well, what do you think?

434
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,920
Yeah, it's coming along.

435
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,970
What are you doing for New Year's Eve dinner?

436
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:34,330
Oh, shit!

437
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,940
DANNY: Bollocks!

438
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,210
Strangers are a bit of an

439
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,940
exotic thing around here.

440
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,580
Oh, come on, I didn't think I was a stranger.

441
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,920
I know, but you're still exotic.

442
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:55,490
Danny, something tells me you've got a story to tell.

443
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,720
Yeah. Mmm.

444
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:12,370
Come on, what are you waiting for? Party's outside.

445
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,300
MAN: Happy New Year!

446
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,910
Happy New Year!

447
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:24,390
It's a tradition around here.

448
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,420
Happy New Year!

449
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,380


450
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,640


451
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,050
Shit!

452
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,830
Mirbat. The artist's name is on the back.

453
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,670
Have them talk to him.

454
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:21,080
One more thing. My boys had some trouble in Oman.

455
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,580
Somebody was tailing them.

456
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:25,150
We'll have to have a look into that, won't we?

457
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,710
Yeah.

458
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,590
Ah, that's how you get it so lifelike, then.

459
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:40,560
Sorry?

460
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,600
Photos of the lads. Isn't that like cheating?

461
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:47,400
I'm recreating an historical event. Accuracy is everything.

462
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,640
That Mirbat painting stopped me cold when I saw it.

463
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,740
You were at Mirbat?

464
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,880
Had a mate there. I was hoping you might have an address for him.

465
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,850
You're with the SAS?

466
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,110
Was.

467
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,620
Then your best bet for an address would be Regimental Association...

468
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,150
They won't talk to me.

469
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:07,590
Spent the last few years plying my trade overseas. Angola and that.

470
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:10,020
I come to you unofficial like.

471
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:16,560
Well, I might have something somewhere.

472
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,170
Just give me a few minutes.

473
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,330
Be my guest.

474
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,880
I got a bullshitter askin' about Mirbat.

475
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,890
Yeah. He claims he's with the regiment.

476
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,230
No, there's no way he was SAS.

477
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:45,330
Yeah, I can smell it off him. Ah, he's a bloody fake.

478
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,820
My contact says the call was cut off,

479
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,760
but Gowling said that there was somebody there asking about Mirbat. It has to be our guy.

480
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,730
And what would you have us do about it?

481
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,230
Find him.

482
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:22,200
If we don't, there's gonna be another murder and it will be one of our Mirbat boys.

483
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,560
Then who are they?

484
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,430
Well, they're pros for sure.

485
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,000
If these guys are going after the SAS,

486
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,400
they're gonna be top-class professional assassins.

487
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,630
They must have a string of hits behind them

488
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,110
but they're completely under the radar.

489
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,740
All we've got is Oman.

490
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,470
Oman?

491
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,380
We all know our people went too far.

492
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,180
Oman, Mirbat. It all needs to be left alone.

493
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,950
You should try telling that to the Welshman.

494
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,120
He's right.

495
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,620
We have to find this phony Welshman and his group.

496
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,690
DAVIES: The file says an SAS officer

497
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:55,360
killed the Sheikh's son at the Battle of Mirbat.

498
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,860
Warrick Steven Cregg.

499
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,870
He was the only officer there that night. Killed everything that moved.

500
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:03,030
He's our worst nightmare. A real hotshot.

501
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,300
Paintings of him, the lot.

502
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,700
Where did you get this?

503
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:08,140
The bloke who did the paintings.

504
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,250
Don't you worry about that, all right? He's shuffled off this mortal coil.

505
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,410
That wasn't part of the deal.

506
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:16,490
Come on, shit happens when you play in the deep end of the pool, Danny.

507
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,950
Why couldn't you two stick to the plan, huh?

508
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,890
You've been watching this Cregg, what's your next big idea?

509
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,520
His wife's in hospital.

510
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,880
When he's not training for the selection march, he spends most days there.

511
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:30,490
MEIER: So why don't we hit him there?

512
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,120
DANNY: No.

513
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,670
Not near his family.

514
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,460
Get me everything you know on that march.

515
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,540
We'll see where that goes.

516
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:51,880
there's

517
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:52,950
only four Mirbat survivors in Britain.

518
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,180
I've got Locals on the other three.

519
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,660
You get the celebrity.

520
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:59,820
Warrick Cregg? You're kidding.

521
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,520
Wish I was.

522
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,360


523
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,060
DAVIES: Welcome to hell, the SAS selection march.

524
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,900
Forty-one miles, fifty-five pounds of gear.

525
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,470
They lose someone every couple of years.

526
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,040
Don't you even think about it.

527
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,240
Why not?

528
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,980
During the march this place is crawling with SAS.

529
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,420
Yeah, you said it yourself. It's an accident waiting to happen.

530
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,250
How are you gonna catch him then?

531
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,760
He's been training for months, he's like a greyhound.

532
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,350
We'll just have to slow him down, won't we?

533
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:37,770
Insulin. Chlorpropamide. Initial here.

534
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,440
Anything doing?

535
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,410
No, Cregg's still in there with his missus.

536
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,320
Here, boss, this will keep you going.

537
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,040
Cheers.

538
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,170
Pennock.

539
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:23,380
 I need you back here, mate. Pronto.

540
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,960
(WOMEN SCREAMING)

541
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,830


542
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,110
Get out of the fucking way!

543
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:35,140


544
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:36,750
WOMAN: Maniac!

545
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:43,770
You wouldn't fucking believe it,

546
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:45,500
somebody was watching Cregg.

547
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,200
What? Mmm.

548
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,470
You think he's from the same stable as the shooter in the desert?

549
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:53,060
Maybe. He was good. Whoever he is, he's too late.

550
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,480
Ah, good, good. Chroma slows him down.

551
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:01,920
Insulin sends him into shock.

552
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:03,820
Hypothermia to you.

553
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,290
And when were you planning on getting it to him?

554
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:06,900
Before the march.

555
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:10,070
How? It's an SAS base, Danny.

556
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:12,120
That you trained in.

557
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:15,670
So think back. The security layout, the lot.

558
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,270
You're nuts.

559
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:20,770
Are you gonna do it?

560
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:24,570
Man, you really are one crazy son of a bitch, Danny.

561
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:35,420


562
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,060
Clock's ticking. You've got under a minute, all right?

563
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,950
We've got company.

564
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:06,550
Lovely night.

565
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:07,990
You can't stop here, mate.

566
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:09,220
I didn't stop, the truck did.

567
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,690
If you don't fucking move it, we will.

568
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:13,520
All right, all right. But it's pissing oil, mate.

569
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,330
There's nothing I can do about it.

570
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:33,610
Turn off the bloody radio.

571
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:03,190
MAN: Where's your gear?

572
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:19,090
Right. On the trucks!

573
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:21,600
SERGEANT 1: I don't care what regiment you're from.

574
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:23,760
I don't care how great you think you are.

575
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,630
Let's see what you're made of, ladies.

576
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:26,830
On the trucks.

577
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:28,370
SERGEANT 2: Come on!

578
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,610
Get moving, you lot.

579
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:58,500
He only got half the dose.

580
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,390
Is it enough?

581
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,630
MEIER: Enough? He's a dead man walking. Stay on him, okay?

582
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,790
DANNY: His name was Salim bin Amr.

583
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:27,360
Do you remember the name?

584
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,460
Did you kill him?

585
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,030
Think back.

586
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:35,580
Did you kill him, Major? CREGG: Yeah, I did. I did the bastard. So bloody what?

587
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,970
Danny didn't want to do this.

588
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,280
DANNY: You did?

589
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:43,270
And your boy doesn't want to go back to the desert.

590
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,060
The Ministry of Defence today announced the death of an army officer during maneuvers.

591
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:04,110
Thirty-three-year-old, Major Warrick Steven Cregg,

592
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:08,360
died of exposure during an SAS exercise on the Brecon Beacons.

593
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,600
Weather conditions at the time were described as appalling, with...

594
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,720
Show a bit of respect, lads.

595
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:44,440
Top that.

596
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:46,940
I come bearing gifts.

597
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:51,240
Oi!

598
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:55,350
AGENT: From my boys in Angola.

599
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:59,010
I have no idea how you're meant to eat this.

600
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,290
Who's on our ass?

601
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:05,190
I'm on it. Don't worry.

602
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,130
Look, there's only one more to go.

603
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:10,460
After this is done, I'll get you boys a nice, cushy job in the sun.

604
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,730
There is no "after this."

605
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:21,470
I'm a vulture. I live off killers.

606
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:23,770
It gives me a unique perspective.

607
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:26,080
Have you heard of the two percent? That's you.

608
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:28,280
Davies, the SAS, all you lot.

609
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,280
Mercenaries, hit men, heroes.

610
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:34,080
You're all part of that two percent of men who are natural killers.

611
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:36,520
That's why you'll never get out.

612
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:39,290
You can't run away from who you are, Danny.

613
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:44,830
That's not who I am, that's what I've done.

614
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,130
And I can do something else.

615
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:49,740
Yeah, yeah.

616
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:52,570
That's all nice and good. But let's just take care of business first, shall we?

617
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:57,140
Your third target, Major Simon McCann,

618
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,980
Mad Simon McCann of late.

619
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,340
How'd you find him?

620
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,970
Asked around. It was easy.

621
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,820
These days, he's your basic "cash for trash" mercenary.

622
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:09,380
He's a sitting duck.

623
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,250
Now didn't I tell you I came bearing gifts?

624
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:15,960
You know where to find me.

625
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,270
DAVIES: You don't trust that snake, do you?

626
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,870
He's lying. Yeah? How do you know?

627
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:24,440
His lips were moving.

628
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:26,340
He just gave us a third target.

629
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,170
You've done nothing on that last file.

630
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:29,510
Someone's onto us.

631
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:32,340
I want Hunter out of there.

632
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,470
I want this finished. And I want to be around to enjoy the money when it is.

633
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:37,780
The first thing you should buy is a pair of balls.

634
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:40,290
We're going after McCann, all right?

635
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,520
ANNE: I miss you.

636
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:52,290
There's a lot I don't know about you, but I do know that much.

637
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:54,970
I convince myself that everything's okay

638
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:57,900
because when I'm with you I'm happy.

639
00:53:59,510 --> 00:53:59,980
But then you go away

640
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:02,940
and I realize that I know nothing about you.

641
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:05,070
I don't know where you go and I don't know what you do,

642
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,740
I mean,

643
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,110
you've got a whole another life, Danny.

644
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:12,490
Is there someone else?

645
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:13,590
Come on, Anne.

646
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,450
Well, then, what is it?

647
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:17,520
I mean, Jesus, what are you not telling me?

648
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,090
What are you hiding?

649
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:21,320
Can we talk about this when I get back?

650
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:23,760
To hell with it.

651
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:28,900
Fuck.

652
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,470
What?

653
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:46,560
You show me a beautiful woman, I'll show you a bloke that's sick of her shit.

654
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,680
Shut up.

655
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:49,220
Roger that.

656
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,150
DANNY: That him?

657
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:54,350
DAVIES: That's him.

658
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,230
Major Simon McCann.

659
00:54:56,370 --> 00:55:00,170
Served in the Sultan's forces till he was pensioned out four years ago.

660
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:02,300
And another.

661
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,410
Oi!

662
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:06,940
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

663
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,010
Piss off, grandpa. You want some?

664
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,280
DANNY: Doesn't look like an invalid.

665
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:17,050
Like I said, a bomb went off under his jeep,

666
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,680
scrambled his wiring.

667
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:22,380
He can't keep a job. He's a fucking psycho.

668
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,260
Jesus.

669
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,570
Come on, mate, that's enough.

670
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:33,570
What's he doing here?

671
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:37,770
That's the one I went head-to-head with at the hospital.

672
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:43,270
Right.

673
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:45,180
Wait, wait, wait.

674
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:52,880
Let's go.

675
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,110
Stick with him.

676
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,860
Mac, it's me. You okay?

677
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,490
McCANN: Oh, yeah, still scraping skinheads off my doorstep.

678
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:42,870
All right, mate. I was just checking in.

679
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,850
Bloke who drives that green Jag, what's his name?

680
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:59,480
AGENT: His name's Spike Logan. He's an ex-soldier of some kind.

681
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:02,960
He got his eye shot out playing a hero somewhere.

682
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:06,580
He's got no job and he keeps odd hours.

683
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:10,830
Don't you know who these guys are?

684
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:13,030
I mean, secrets being your bread and butter.

685
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:14,360
Don't worry about it.

686
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,200
I do worry about it. You should, too.

687
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:20,170
Every move my guys make, these lot are waiting.

688
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:25,370
You ask me, I think it's time you put those fancy shoes of yours on a few throats.

689
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,310
Yes. But no one is asking you.

690
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,990
DAVIES: You'll be interviewing for a security position, Mr. McCann.

691
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:37,520
McCANN: Right.

692
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:39,720
Actually we got your name from a mutual friend in the SAS.

693
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,800
Yeah, really?

694
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:44,090
So, we'll see you Tuesday the 17th, at 10:00.

695
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:45,000
Okay.

696
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:46,230
We look forward to it.

697
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:47,100
See you then.

698
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,030
All right, my son.

699
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:51,170
He'll be there.

700
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:51,860
Good.

701
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,200
I don't get it.

702
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,440
McCann lives here.

703
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:00,810
He'll be here for the interview, Tuesday at 10:00.

704
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:03,580
He'll take this road.

705
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,020
The Boston Brakes. Perfect.

706
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,550
They weren't perfect in Boston.

707
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:08,880
I wasn't at the controls.

708
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:10,050
We've got 10 days.

709
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:11,220
MEIER: Ten days?

710
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,690
The quicker we get this done, the better.

711
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:14,920
I'm going to need to bring in some help.

712
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:15,530
Okay. DAVIES: "Okay." Just like that?

713
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:19,070
McCann's being watched.

714
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:20,660
How are you gonna get a confession out of him?

715
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,830
We aren't. We'll fake it.

716
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:27,270
Bit of bad lighting and camera work, you could be him.

717
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:30,610
What we'll do is play back what he admitted to in the reports.

718
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:48,430
Who are you?

719
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,590
I'm the one they let fly around in an unmarked chopper

720
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:52,170
with a gun in my pocket.

721
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,860
You can call me MFWIC.

722
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:54,940
"MFWIC"?

723
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:57,870
Mother Fucker What's In Charge.

724
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,900
We have questions.

725
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:04,300
About this little illegal club of yours, The Feather Men.

726
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:08,010
Your attack dog, time to bring him to heel, eh?

727
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:13,420
And then we'll put that on the agenda.

728
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,750
Gentlemen.

729
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:16,720
We'll be with you in a minute.

730
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:25,960
I want to put Locals on Major McCann around the clock.

731
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,090
I realize McCann is an old friend of yours,

732
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,930
 but what has it to do with us?

733
00:59:33,810 --> 00:59:36,680
But this is our chance to get the bastards who killed Cregg and Harris.

734
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:39,680
The authorities found no evidence of foul play in either case.

735
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:43,170
What are you talking about, "No evidence?" I've got the evidence right here.

736
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:50,120
Everybody in this room knows that those men were killed.

737
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:54,120
Everybody knows that McCann is going to be next.

738
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:55,090
That's enough, Spike.

739
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:56,390
We have to do something.

740
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:57,730
THE DON: Well, we could put it to the vote.

741
00:59:57,870 --> 01:00:00,030
Yes, but that would require the full committee.

742
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:03,330
And it will have to wait.

743
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:19,520
Spike. That was a set-up.

744
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:23,750
He sent him away. He knew there'd be a vote.

745
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:24,950
Spike, please. Look, listen.

746
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:28,530
This is getting big.

747
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:31,960
The powers that be are asking questions. Pressure's being applied.

748
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,630
They have their reputations to protect.

749
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:37,040
I'm not doing this to protect reputations.

750
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:38,500
You know, a light touch is one thing,

751
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,110
but no touch at all? I can't do this.

752
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:44,370
You realize this thing is set up for maximum deniability?

753
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:45,610
You're the only one who knows the Locals.

754
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:47,680
All their orders come through you.

755
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,650
So?

756
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:53,380
So? If this comes out, you're the one who takes the fall.

757
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,920
Fall? From where?

758
01:00:56,890 --> 01:00:59,590
I am done with this whole committee thing.

759
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,850
I'm gonna find him.

760
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:07,660
MEIER: He's a good kid, don't worry. I'm shtupping his mom.

761
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:09,370
DAVIES: Does he know he can't bring his mom on the job?

762
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:11,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

763
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:32,290
DAVIES: Tell your mates in Oman I said hello.

764
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:35,800
Danny, is this what it was like when you were first starting?

765
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:38,920
This is your first job? Jesus.

766
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:43,160
My first time, I puked for a day afterwards.

767
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:47,870
I was young and dumb, just the way the army likes them. I could be good at this, man.

768
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,210
I mean, it's easy, yeah?

769
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:52,180
Killing's easy.

770
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:56,740
Living with it is the hard part.

771
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,610
PORTER: If I see him, I'll give you a bell.

772
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,490
Don't be shy about spreading the word.

773
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,030
There's a very tidy finder's fee.

774
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,830
I'll keep my eyes peeled.

775
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:12,200
One more and we'll call it a night.

776
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:17,840
JAKE: We're on.

777
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:21,570
MEIER: He's late.

778
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:26,490
Just keep me at 75 feet

779
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:29,050
and give me a clear line of sight. Yeah, okay.

780
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,290
Where'd you buy your license?

781
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:24,370
On his tail. Doing 60.

782
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:32,680
You'll have a visual on Danny in one minute.

783
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:38,620
Stay with him, Jake.

784
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:40,450
I got him.

785
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:43,790
DAVIES: We have target in sight.

786
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:44,720
JAKE: Gonna miss it.

787
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:47,690
Come on, get in. Get in behind him!

788
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:48,800
Just do it, get in! There's not enough room!

789
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:49,490
Push him!

790
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:50,760
I can't get in there.

791
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,410
Okay, then overtake him. Go! Pass him!

792
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:56,370
DAVIES: What the hell are you doing, Meier?

793
01:03:56,510 --> 01:03:57,700
MEIER: I need a range countdown.

794
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,070
Meier: Don't screw this up.

795
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:00,680
I'll operate looking backwards.

796
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:01,800
Relax, Meier.

797
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:03,840
Davies will give you the countdown.

798
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:09,280
DAVIES: 400 meters.

799
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,120
MEIER: Okay, range me.

800
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:20,490
300 meters.

801
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:23,960
Outside lane, Meier.

802
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:28,570
200 meters.

803
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:33,800
Here he comes.

804
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:36,740
100 meters.

805
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:47,520
Now, now. Now, Meier! Shut up!

806
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:49,020
Now, Meier!

807
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:51,980
Fishtail! Fishtail!

808
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:04,170
JAKE: You fucking got him!

809
01:05:04,310 --> 01:05:08,160
You got him, man. MEIER: Oh, fuck, he's dead. He's dead as Elvis.

810
01:05:17,090 --> 01:05:18,250
You got him, man!

811
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,090
Stop the car.

812
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:22,950
We gotta be sure Elvis has left the building.

813
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,800
DAVIES: Target had a minder. Head to the exit point.

814
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:40,580
Bring him to me.

815
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:43,370
He had a fucking minder. Fuck!

816
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:44,170
You got him, man. You got him!

817
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:47,210
Shut up! Drive! Go! Go! Go!

818
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:47,910
Who is he?

819
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:50,110
I don't know. Give me an update, Davies.

820
01:05:52,050 --> 01:05:53,780
Oh, man, he's coming fast!

821
01:05:55,890 --> 01:05:59,080
Up here there's a yard. Take a left. Shit! Up here to the left. Keep going.

822
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:00,560
Hold on.

823
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:03,660
Come in, Davies.

824
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:10,630
Davies, where the fuck are you?

825
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:13,030
Got you, you bastards.

826
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:17,270
MEIER: Fuck this! Go! Go!

827
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:21,550
JAKE: Here he comes! Here he comes!

828
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:27,510
Get out of the car!

829
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,260
Where the fuck do you guys come from?

830
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:32,330
Step away from the car. Easy.

831
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:33,790
Jake. Yeah?

832
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:36,420
Take it easy. Check the car. Slowly.

833
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,560
No, no, no, no!

834
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,140
No!

835
01:07:09,330 --> 01:07:11,980
He had no ID. Nothing.

836
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:13,630
Not a fucking thing.

837
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:16,030
Who the fuck is he?

838
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,660
This shouldn't have happened.

839
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:22,570
This should not have fucking happened! Take it easy, Danny.

840
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:23,180
Danny...

841
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:24,780
Take it easy?

842
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:28,440
We were out of there. Clean. Done.

843
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:52,200
PENNOCK: Look, I'm getting nothing. Campbell's not picking up.

844
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:53,670
Ls there anything at your end? Fuck.

845
01:07:53,810 --> 01:07:56,000
Who are these bastards?

846
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:59,270
I don't know. But they're looking for their man and they're not legit.

847
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:01,850
Jake, call this number.

848
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:05,880
Tell the Agent we need a cleanup crew here ASAP.

849
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:08,390
And wire that radio into my car.

850
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,250
Gimme here.

851
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:14,590
That's it then.

852
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:15,890
Yeah.

853
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:17,420
Done.

854
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,660
I fly tonight.

855
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:22,900
You should get going, too. They're close.

856
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,530
What happens to Meier's cut?

857
01:08:25,170 --> 01:08:26,840
There has to be somebody.

858
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:31,230
Poor sod. I'll have a hooker for him. He'd like that. (CHUCKLES)

859
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:32,710
Yeah.

860
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,580
Be safe.

861
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:36,680
You too, Davies.

862
01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:47,860
PENNOCK: Sorry. We 're still looking for Campbell, but it looks bad.

863
01:09:18,330 --> 01:09:21,330
Thank you, sir. If there's anything else...

864
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:24,800
Room service. Something exotic.

865
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:47,320
Yeah?

866
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:49,150
PORTER: I found your Welshman

867
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:51,490
You sure it's him?

868
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:53,090
I'm sure.

869
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:26,190
(SCREAMING) Fucking hell!

870
01:10:28,030 --> 01:10:29,430
Get up. Get dressed. Move!

871
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:32,430
Look... Get up!

872
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,490
Don't say a word to anyone. Do you understand?

873
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:39,170
You killed Simon McCann, didn't you?

874
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:42,630
Yeah? And Campbell. Where is he, you fucker?

875
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:44,110
Never heard of him.

876
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:48,810
That all you got?

877
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:54,960
Yeah, Spike? We got the Welshman.

878
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:56,820
We 're bringing him to you now. Over.

879
01:10:57,630 --> 01:11:00,190
SPIKE: Nice work, Pennock. Well done.

880
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:02,800
I'm looking forward to meeting the bastard.

881
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,570
Hey, Spike's gonna cut your dick off and shove it in your mouth. You like that?

882
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:11,260
I like the sound of that, yeah.

883
01:11:11,410 --> 01:11:12,500
Do you? Yeah, I do.

884
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:13,940
Get in the van.

885
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:15,980
Get in. Come on, get in!

886
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:26,910
Fuck me. You're kidding. Come on. Get in!

887
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:35,330
There you are, you prick.

888
01:11:49,780 --> 01:11:51,140


889
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:51,680
Open up.

890
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:53,110


891
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,660
Boss.

892
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:16,630
What am I meant to do with that?

893
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:18,400
He had this on him.

894
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:21,070
A phone number. Great work.

895
01:12:22,850 --> 01:12:26,610
That pile of mincemeat was our best chance of finding out who these bastards are.

896
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:31,010
Print him and trace that bloody number.

897
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:35,110
You fucking idiots!

898
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:52,770
DANNY: Drop it.

899
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:56,770
Left hand. Put the gun on the floor.

900
01:13:05,450 --> 01:13:06,850
Kick it to me.

901
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:13,060
The Welshman, they were bringing him to you. Where is he?

902
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,160
He didn't make it.

903
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:17,590
You? You do it?

904
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:20,500
A truck. He made a break for it.

905
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,760
He got lucky.

906
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:23,640
Would have been very slow otherwise.

907
01:13:23,770 --> 01:13:25,400
Yeah, well that was my fucking friend.

908
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:27,240
Yeah, and McCann was mine. And what about fucking...

909
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:28,600
Campbell?

910
01:13:29,110 --> 01:13:30,200
No.

911
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:34,470
Davies. Meier. Harris.

912
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:40,320
McCann. Cregg. Campbell. Too many names on that list.

913
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:42,820
Don't go adding yours, Spike.

914
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,690
Inside.

915
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:48,630
Who are you?

916
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:50,660
Doesn't matter.

917
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:53,200
After tonight, I don't exist.

918
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:54,860
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

919
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,830
It's over.

920
01:13:56,970 --> 01:13:58,300
Done. You think so?

921
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:03,580
No uniform, no war, not special.

922
01:14:04,510 --> 01:14:06,340
You don't know what to do with yourself.

923
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:09,410
Nobody knows what to do with you.

924
01:14:09,550 --> 01:14:10,480
Right? Wrong.

925
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:13,020
You know my name but you don't know me.

926
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,390
You have no idea who you're fucking with.

927
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:16,790
Really?

928
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:20,650
Don't follow me.

929
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:24,100
Don't put your name on that list.

930
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,840
The third confession.

931
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:45,320
SHEIKH AMR: The killers have been killed,

932
01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:48,390
now you can go home.

933
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:51,550
BAKHAIT: You can have your man.

934
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:54,660
You will get the money when it's been checked.

935
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:56,920
Bring him out.

936
01:14:59,030 --> 01:15:00,630
Bring him out!

937
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:06,140
Let me put... I just wanna put my watch on.

938
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:07,540
What's the matter with you?

939
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:08,900
You all right? Yeah.

940
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,340
What's the plan?

941
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,950
Get out of here.

942
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,310
Okay, sounds good.

943
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:20,780
I was sure you were gonna get yourself killed, kiddo.

944
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,320
How in the hell did you do it? How'd you pull it off?

945
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:24,520
I don't want to talk about it.

946
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:26,130
I get it.

947
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:27,390
Thank you. Not from me, but from my kids

948
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:29,190
 for having a dad.

949
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:31,090
I could never thank you enough for what you did. Never.

950
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:33,570
Yeah, you can.

951
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:34,790
You can get out of the business. Be done with this shit.

952
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:37,200
No more soldiering. No more mercenary work.

953
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:38,900
All right. Okay, okay.

954
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:43,580
I'm asking you, please. Tell me you're done.

955
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:45,670
I'm done. I'm out.

956
01:15:45,810 --> 01:15:48,150
Good.Stay out.

957
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,910
Otherwise all this is for nothing.

958
01:15:50,490 --> 01:15:52,180
So, how are the Yankees doing?

959
01:16:18,710 --> 01:16:20,410
You could have called.

960
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:23,150
You wouldn't have answered.

961
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:26,640
No. Sorry about that.

962
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:30,880
You're sorry? It's me who should be sorry.

963
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:38,130
So it's over? You going back again?

964
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:40,300
No.

965
01:16:43,210 --> 01:16:45,800
And you're ready to tell me everything?

966
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,740
Whatever you want to know.

967
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:53,210
Good.

968
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:59,250
Except I don't want to know. Not anymore.

969
01:17:04,190 --> 01:17:06,160
I've missed you, Danny.

970
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:11,060
I don't really care about the past, I just care about now.

971
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:32,280
Hey, boss.

972
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:33,150
All right, Cal?

973
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:34,260
That phone number?

974
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:35,650
That was a business.

975
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:37,690
It's for some shit travel agent.

976
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:41,520
Runs mercenaries in and out of every shithole in the world.

977
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:43,360
Come in.

978
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:05,650
Hello?

979
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:08,020
AGENT: Hello, Danny.

980
01:18:10,590 --> 01:18:12,150
How'd you get this number?

981
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:16,230
Please, Danny, don't insult my professionalism.

982
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,590
What do you want?

983
01:18:18,730 --> 01:18:20,930
We got a problem with the job.

984
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:25,040
The job's done. No.

985
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:27,370
You killed the wrong guy.

986
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:28,570
There's one more to go.

987
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:30,370
I busted my nuts setting this job up

988
01:18:30,510 --> 01:18:31,500
 and I want my 10%.

989
01:18:31,650 --> 01:18:34,880
No, I did what I had to do.

990
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,750
Tell that to the Sheikh. He wants a London meet with his son.

991
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:42,680
Check with your girlfriend before you make any rash decisions. Eh?

992
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:55,430
What are you doing? Come to bed.

993
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:03,000
Come with me, Anne.

994
01:20:03,610 --> 01:20:04,370
What?

995
01:20:04,510 --> 01:20:05,840
To Paris.

996
01:20:06,370 --> 01:20:08,400
You can wait for me there while I'm in London.

997
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:11,210
Leave tomorrow. Nothing's keeping you here, right?

998
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:12,780
It's the middle of the night. Anne. Anne!

999
01:20:12,910 --> 01:20:15,980
They know about you.

1000
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:17,920
Who knows about me?

1001
01:20:19,490 --> 01:20:21,460
And about us.

1002
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:56,750
When will this be over?

1003
01:20:56,890 --> 01:20:58,320
Soon.

1004
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:02,590
If all goes well.

1005
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,870
It will, won't it?

1006
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,290
Danny.

1007
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:36,130
Keep a good eye on her, huh?

1008
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:38,290
Listen, don't do this on your own.

1009
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:39,400
No other way.

1010
01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:41,060
Davies, Meier, all this heat on you.

1011
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,140
Come on, let's just get in the car, we'll go to London,

1012
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:44,500
 be at the airport...

1013
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,300
No. We have a deal, remember?

1014
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,710
What do you mean? You think I can't cut this, is that it?

1015
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:50,240
I mean, I'm not a babysitter, come on!

1016
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:53,010
I need to know she's safe.

1017
01:21:53,150 --> 01:21:55,810
You're the only one I trust. This is bullshit. You could run, both of you just go, come on.

1018
01:21:55,950 --> 01:21:58,210
Everyone gets found. You know that.

1019
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:00,690
You're gonna get yourself killed, kiddo.

1020
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,390
Thanks for doing this.

1021
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:10,830
You gotta be kidding me.

1022
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:25,370
Welcome back to London, sir. Thank you, sir.

1023
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:08,020
You tell the old man he threatens her again, I'll put it between his eyes.

1024
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:10,090
Harris, the pilot, on his film he said

1025
01:23:10,230 --> 01:23:12,850
another soldier killed my brother.

1026
01:23:12,990 --> 01:23:16,300
He was winding us up. He thought it was some kind of a joke!

1027
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:18,270
This was just published.

1028
01:23:19,470 --> 01:23:21,700
The author served with the SAS.

1029
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:25,130
He describes an ambush where he killed a guerilla leader.

1030
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:28,940
Harris did not kill Hussain.

1031
01:23:32,810 --> 01:23:36,810
You gave me his name. You said he was guilty.

1032
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:40,050
Such is Allah's will.

1033
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:42,780
Allah's will?

1034
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:45,320
You had me kill an innocent man.

1035
01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:49,560
The book will be the real killer's confession.

1036
01:23:50,570 --> 01:23:52,190
My father...

1037
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:55,090
I know what your father needs.

1038
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:09,580
I need everything you can get on a Ranulph Fiennes.

1039
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:12,240
Yeah, writer, ex-SAS.

1040
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:24,930


1041
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:27,700
What you got?

1042
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:29,860
I got Fiennes.

1043
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:32,470
He's still pushing his book on Oman.

1044
01:24:32,610 --> 01:24:35,670
He'll be doing a press bash on Tuesday.

1045
01:24:37,310 --> 01:24:38,040
Tuesday. I know it's a bit short notice,

1046
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:40,980
but I'll be able to put a crew together. Nah.

1047
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:44,150
I'll do this on my own.

1048
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:47,750
Danny, are you sure? It's just a phone call.

1049
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:51,150
I guess he's sure.

1050
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:58,760
B-I-N-G fucking O.

1051
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:02,530
I knew I'd find you, you bastard.

1052
01:25:19,550 --> 01:25:21,040
Do you mind if I sit down?

1053
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:22,880
You look lonely.

1054
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:24,420
You're Danny's friend.

1055
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:27,350
The famous Hunter.

1056
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:28,790
He say nice things?

1057
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:30,400
What are you doing here?

1058
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:32,600
Watching you.

1059
01:25:32,730 --> 01:25:33,860
You should be with him.

1060
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,470
I tried. It didn't work.

1061
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,330
He wanted me here to protect you.

1062
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:40,100
And you look like you needed protecting.

1063
01:25:40,580 --> 01:25:41,770
From what?

1064
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:43,700
You.

1065
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:48,640
You're thinking about him not coming back. What happens then?

1066
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:50,120
No, I...

1067
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:52,620
I have a wife, I know the look.

1068
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:56,520
We've known each other through thick and thin, Danny and I.

1069
01:25:57,530 --> 01:26:01,190
Celine, my wife, she loves him, my kids love him.

1070
01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:03,460
I mean, wild animals like Danny.

1071
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,970
I know Danny's going to come back for you.

1072
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:13,420
And when he does, you're going to steal him away. Huh?

1073
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:15,400
I don't know what the plan is.

1074
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:18,840


1075
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:20,640


1076
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:23,550


1077
01:26:23,690 --> 01:26:26,210
I have a woman to interrogate now.

1078
01:26:32,030 --> 01:26:33,520
PENNOCK: All right, look alive, lads.

1079
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:34,650
Boys.

1080
01:26:35,730 --> 01:26:37,530
So this guy is good. Very good.

1081
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:39,390
If he senses something's up,

1082
01:26:39,530 --> 01:26:41,090
he'll run until you corner him and then he fights.

1083
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:43,070
But now the gloves are off.

1084
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,690
This all fucking ends today.

1085
01:26:44,810 --> 01:26:46,360
MARTIN: All right, everybody knows the rules.

1086
01:26:46,510 --> 01:26:48,070
MAN: There are no rules.

1087
01:27:21,610 --> 01:27:23,800
MAN: Boss, he's out front. I think we're on.

1088
01:27:32,350 --> 01:27:34,180
This could be him. Black leathers.

1089
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:35,580
Roger that.

1090
01:27:50,070 --> 01:27:51,770
He just took the service stairs. It has to be him.

1091
01:27:51,910 --> 01:27:54,770
Just hold your positions. We'll know soon enough.

1092
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:24,830
He's down, boss. We got him! He stays alive.

1093
01:28:24,970 --> 01:28:28,220
Pennock, don't you touch him until I'm there.

1094
01:28:28,710 --> 01:28:29,540
Stay here.

1095
01:28:35,650 --> 01:28:37,050
Stay there, you fucker.

1096
01:28:38,990 --> 01:28:40,750
Get his helmet off before he chokes.

1097
01:28:47,130 --> 01:28:48,320
Shit.

1098
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:53,160
Hands high, against the wall.

1099
01:28:56,270 --> 01:28:57,970
Okay, easy with that.

1100
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:39,910
Guys, our man's down. Head for the roof.

1101
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:09,370
Pennock, head for the roof.

1102
01:30:10,180 --> 01:30:11,610
We're on our way up now, boss.

1103
01:30:12,110 --> 01:30:13,360
Come on, move!

1104
01:30:38,470 --> 01:30:40,570
He jumped! He jumped!

1105
01:31:12,070 --> 01:31:14,100
PENNOCK: Come on, come on, he's on the move. Let's go!

1106
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:00,650
SPIKE: Pennock?

1107
01:32:02,820 --> 01:32:04,190
Don't you do it.

1108
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:08,930
PENNOCK: There's no sign of him up here, boss.

1109
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:12,810
I can see all the way to the river. He's gone.

1110
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:25,180
Shit.

1111
01:32:26,710 --> 01:32:28,480
Move and you're dead.

1112
01:32:31,190 --> 01:32:32,880
Right, let's go, let's go.

1113
01:32:36,820 --> 01:32:37,950
Get in.

1114
01:32:58,710 --> 01:33:00,080
What is this?

1115
01:33:03,150 --> 01:33:04,520
PENNOCK: That's for Campbell.

1116
01:33:06,850 --> 01:33:07,480
And that's for Cregg.

1117
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:09,210
SPIKE: You finished?

1118
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:11,860
We haven't even started.

1119
01:33:11,990 --> 01:33:13,320
Take the hood off.

1120
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:17,190
Wait outside, boys.

1121
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:23,730
Save a little bit for us, boss.

1122
01:33:27,210 --> 01:33:29,870
So why is he still alive? Why didn't you kill him?

1123
01:33:31,250 --> 01:33:32,710
Is that what you would have done?

1124
01:33:33,550 --> 01:33:35,240
I thought you were the good guys.

1125
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:39,010
Who are you? Who do you work for?

1126
01:33:39,690 --> 01:33:41,250
You and I got a lot in common.

1127
01:33:41,390 --> 01:33:43,950
Really? You think so?

1128
01:33:44,090 --> 01:33:46,650
So, you're sitting there, tied to a chair

1129
01:33:46,790 --> 01:33:49,260
and I'm standing here with a gun in my hand.

1130
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:52,990
Now you tell me what the fuck this was all about.

1131
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:55,670
"Was?"

1132
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:58,830
You think this is over?

1133
01:33:58,970 --> 01:34:00,770
There'll be somebody else.

1134
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:02,900
Your boy, Fiennes, is gonna die.

1135
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:15,850
Go on, pull the trigger. Kill me and you kill Fiennes.

1136
01:34:15,990 --> 01:34:17,150
They won't stop till they get him.

1137
01:34:17,290 --> 01:34:18,880
I stopped you, I'll stop them.

1138
01:34:19,030 --> 01:34:22,890
I didn't want to kill him. They will.

1139
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:26,590
You put that in the right hands, this thing's over.

1140
01:34:26,730 --> 01:34:27,930
The camera? Why?

1141
01:34:28,070 --> 01:34:31,700
Proof. Evidence that he's dead.

1142
01:34:33,210 --> 01:34:35,200
It's the only way you'll save him.

1143
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:39,770
You tell me I'll walk, I'll tell you who's behind this and where to find him.

1144
01:34:42,020 --> 01:34:45,760
Okay. You walk.

1145
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:49,550
Sheikh Amr bin Issa.

1146
01:34:49,890 --> 01:34:51,410
You'll find him in Oman.

1147
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:52,460
Why?

1148
01:34:52,590 --> 01:34:53,650
The war.

1149
01:34:55,730 --> 01:34:57,490
They killed three of his sons.

1150
01:35:04,570 --> 01:35:05,570
No.

1151
01:35:14,150 --> 01:35:15,950
Some good guy, eh?

1152
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:24,720
Drop it.

1153
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:33,190
Inside.

1154
01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:42,820
Beside him. On your knees.

1155
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:55,290
You were set up.

1156
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:57,390
That's what we love about you lot.

1157
01:35:58,060 --> 01:36:00,190
You only care about the action.

1158
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:06,170
Never think about what you might really be fighting for. Or who.

1159
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:09,900
Never see the big picture.

1160
01:36:14,540 --> 01:36:19,530
You're the one that was set up. He just wouldn't get out of the way.

1161
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:24,270
Her Majesty's government doesn't like secret societies.

1162
01:36:25,150 --> 01:36:27,710
Particularly when they get in the way of our interests.

1163
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:31,830
Do you know how much oil that pathetic crust of desert is floating on?

1164
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:34,520
Do you know what those contracts are worth?

1165
01:36:34,660 --> 01:36:36,150
Three men's lives.

1166
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:37,700
That's right.

1167
01:36:39,370 --> 01:36:40,370
That's right.

1168
01:36:40,970 --> 01:36:41,990
We deliver the killers.

1169
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:43,800
Son Number 4 goes home

1170
01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:48,100
and when Sheikhy re-ups the contracts, we get favorable consideration.

1171
01:36:49,010 --> 01:36:50,440
A bargain. You bastard, you're a...

1172
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:51,910
Patriot.

1173
01:36:52,050 --> 01:36:55,110
Who serves his country as those three men did with their deaths.

1174
01:36:55,850 --> 01:36:57,180
As you will with yours.

1175
01:37:54,980 --> 01:37:56,200
(WOMAN SCREAMS)

1176
01:37:58,780 --> 01:37:59,470


1177
01:38:08,660 --> 01:38:09,680


1178
01:38:27,010 --> 01:38:28,470
AGENT: There she is.

1179
01:38:28,610 --> 01:38:30,670
Danny might've dropped off the radar,

1180
01:38:30,810 --> 01:38:34,750
but one thing's for sure. He'll come back for her.

1181
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,510
He'll come through that door with $6 million

1182
01:38:37,650 --> 01:38:39,780
and she won't be there.

1183
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:44,340
Who don't you screw out of his 10%? Yours truly.

1184
01:38:45,690 --> 01:38:46,790
Boss.

1185
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:52,220
Deal with him.

1186
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:13,170
It wasn't personal. Just business.

1187
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:18,780
You played us. I don't care why.

1188
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:22,120
But if ever a lying piece of shit needed killing, it was you.

1189
01:40:26,530 --> 01:40:27,460
Game's over.

1190
01:40:27,590 --> 01:40:28,960
You know, I wouldn't have hurt her.

1191
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:32,870
I just wanted my cut. She was only collateral.

1192
01:40:41,110 --> 01:40:42,630
If you go after them,

1193
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:48,320
I'll find you. Remember, everybody gets found.

1194
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:49,980
Even you.

1195
01:41:05,070 --> 01:41:06,120
HUNTER: You gotta get those photos to that old bastard

1196
01:41:06,270 --> 01:41:08,890
to finish this thing for good, you hear, kiddo?

1197
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:11,610
That's why I'm here. What about you?

1198
01:41:11,810 --> 01:41:13,360
Babysitting's over, kiddo.

1199
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:15,330
Who says? I say.

1200
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:17,970
She's safe. You're the one taking the chances now.

1201
01:41:18,110 --> 01:41:18,670
Come on. "Come on?"

1202
01:41:18,810 --> 01:41:21,010
You walked into a trap last time.

1203
01:41:21,010 --> 01:41:22,910
You think I'm going to let you do that again?

1204
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:24,710
I told your girl you were going to be coming back to her.

1205
01:41:24,850 --> 01:41:25,780
You want to make a liar out of me?

1206
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:28,790
You know, you were supposed to be guarding her, not interviewing her.

1207
01:41:28,790 --> 01:41:31,550
Well, I was always a sucker for a pretty face, no denying that.

1208
01:41:31,690 --> 01:41:34,250
She's a keeper, that's for sure.

1209
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:37,160
She doesn't know, does she?

1210
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:38,320
Some. Yeah.

1211
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:39,560
It's going to be tough. My old man used to say,

1212
01:41:39,700 --> 01:41:42,930
"Life's like licking honey from a thorn."

1213
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:44,300
Yeah, what does that mean?

1214
01:41:44,440 --> 01:41:46,500
Something about good times and bad times.

1215
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:49,770
Seems like it's been all thorns for us lately. Both of us.

1216
01:41:49,910 --> 01:41:51,340
All right, let's finish this.

1217
01:41:52,050 --> 01:41:53,340
I'll be top cover.

1218
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:55,570
Anything goes wrong,

1219
01:41:55,720 --> 01:41:58,620
I'm coming in. Hey, look, the Sheikh wants this over. It's in, hand over the photos, and out.

1220
01:41:58,650 --> 01:41:59,140
Yeah? Yeah.

1221
01:41:59,290 --> 01:42:01,220
There isn't going to be a problem.

1222
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:03,850
From your mouth to God's ears.

1223
01:42:03,990 --> 01:42:06,460
Don't move till I give the all-clear, okay?

1224
01:42:26,810 --> 01:42:30,220
BAKHAIT: Who are you? What do you want?

1225
01:42:32,950 --> 01:42:34,350
For the Sheikh.

1226
01:42:36,090 --> 01:42:38,460
I have to see it placed in his hands.

1227
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:52,970
Take these to my people.

1228
01:42:53,110 --> 01:42:55,630
Show them what I have done.

1229
01:42:57,980 --> 01:42:59,780
I have a message for the Sheikh.

1230
01:43:06,390 --> 01:43:08,250
He's still alive.

1231
01:43:11,790 --> 01:43:13,230
They're fakes.

1232
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:18,130
But this is going to end.

1233
01:43:33,110 --> 01:43:34,640
I don't care.

1234
01:43:37,180 --> 01:43:43,130
What'll I do in that godforsaken desert?

1235
01:43:48,730 --> 01:43:50,560
Haven't you forgotten something?

1236
01:44:07,850 --> 01:44:09,320
HUNTER: Hold it, hold it, stay where you are.

1237
01:44:09,450 --> 01:44:10,970
Something's not right here.

1238
01:44:18,990 --> 01:44:20,150
You seeing this?

1239
01:44:20,290 --> 01:44:21,520
Yeah, I see it.

1240
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,630
So we're in the wrong place.

1241
01:44:48,990 --> 01:44:50,010
HUNTER: Let's go! Let's go!

1242
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:32,590
Relax, I only killed the car.

1243
01:46:16,110 --> 01:46:17,270
You again!

1244
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:30,260
Back at the palace, what happened in there?

1245
01:46:31,390 --> 01:46:33,720
He was there, waiting for a message from you.

1246
01:46:33,860 --> 01:46:35,490
I was the messenger.

1247
01:46:35,630 --> 01:46:36,720
And?

1248
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:38,160
What do you think?

1249
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:41,800
His boy in there didn't give a shit.

1250
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:44,130
He's not going back to the desert, so there'll be no oil contracts.

1251
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:46,930
It was all for nothing.

1252
01:46:47,070 --> 01:46:48,600
Is that right?

1253
01:47:01,250 --> 01:47:02,880
And the winner is.

1254
01:47:03,990 --> 01:47:05,460
So that's what this is all about.

1255
01:47:05,590 --> 01:47:08,190
Yeah, it's all hookers and blow from here on in.

1256
01:47:08,830 --> 01:47:10,820
You just don't get it, do you?

1257
01:47:13,330 --> 01:47:14,060
Ditch it.

1258
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:15,630
You sure?

1259
01:47:16,040 --> 01:47:17,700
Ditch it.

1260
01:47:19,410 --> 01:47:21,310
I gotta cover my expenses.

1261
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:24,640
You can't go back to England.

1262
01:47:24,780 --> 01:47:26,010
Not after killing that spook.

1263
01:47:26,150 --> 01:47:27,310
Who the fuck are you?

1264
01:47:27,450 --> 01:47:29,850
Who, me? The voice of experience.

1265
01:47:29,980 --> 01:47:30,570
Where are you going to go?

1266
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:31,880
What are you going to do?

1267
01:47:32,020 --> 01:47:32,950
You're going to need this.

1268
01:47:33,590 --> 01:47:35,990
New name, new face, new papers.

1269
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:38,490
Expensive. You'll see.

1270
01:47:47,830 --> 01:47:49,300
Damn shame.

1271
01:47:53,370 --> 01:47:55,240
You think you get to just walk away?

1272
01:47:56,140 --> 01:47:57,730
Nobody walks away.

1273
01:47:58,450 --> 01:48:01,040
Not me or you, none of us.

1274
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:03,550
The old man you just killed,

1275
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:05,780
he told me a war isn't over

1276
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:07,780
until both sides say it is.

1277
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:10,520
Well, I'm telling you now, this is over for me.

1278
01:48:10,660 --> 01:48:14,290
Really? And what? You want me to say, "Me, too," and then it's happy ever after?

1279
01:48:14,430 --> 01:48:15,720
Your choice.

1280
01:48:15,860 --> 01:48:17,960
You know, when I got this, they told me my war was over.

1281
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:21,360
I told them they were full of shit. Now I'm telling it to you.

1282
01:48:21,700 --> 01:48:23,290
Let it go.

1283
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:31,210
So where are you going?

1284
01:48:31,510 --> 01:48:33,170
What, are you planning a visit?

1285
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:35,210
You never know.

1286
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:40,910
You come. I'll be waiting.

1287
01:48:47,130 --> 01:48:49,150
We'll call you a cab from the airport.

1288
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:15,790
Aren't you Anne Frazer? The girl with those weird gumboots?

1289
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:19,990
Are you Danny Bryce, the boy who went away?

1290
01:49:20,130 --> 01:49:23,260
Yeah. I'm back.

1291
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:24,990
Where you headed?

1292
01:49:26,130 --> 01:49:27,460
I don't know.

1293
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:30,690
Me, neither. Want to come along?

1294
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:59,460


1295
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:01,930


1296
01:50:02,070 --> 01:50:02,900


1297
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:04,630


1298
01:50:04,770 --> 01:50:09,110


1299
01:50:09,710 --> 01:50:12,970


1300
01:50:13,110 --> 01:50:15,170


1301
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:18,340


1302
01:50:19,250 --> 01:50:22,480


1303
01:50:22,620 --> 01:50:25,590
