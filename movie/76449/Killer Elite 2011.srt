00:01:26,561 --> 00:01:30,905
What are you doing? Thi food you get here?

4
00:01:31,552 --> 00:01:33,208
Yes, very dapper.

5
00:01:34,644 --> 00:01:37,355
Any idea why is that?
-That?

6
00:01:38,144 --> 00:01:40,438
Free chicken.
He and the locals call it.

7
00:01:41,724 --> 00:01:44,584
You get rid of headaches,
about all diseases.

8
00:01:45,157 --> 00:01:46,350
It's an iguana.

9
00:01:46,947 --> 00:01:52,870
I think I do indigestion.
Tool Iguana.

10
00:01:57,704 --> 00:01:58,230
- Well, we are in Salvador.
-Yes.

11
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:02,197
- Sucks.
-But in Angola? The food is good there, right?

12
00:02:02,232 --> 00:02:05,021
Shit.
-In Dijou?

13
00:02:05,907 --> 00:02:07,258
Shit, shit.

14
00:02:08,613 --> 00:02:10,544
Sure, in New York ...
-... Shit.

15
00:02:12,213 --> 00:02:14,799
I think better go in Hawaii.
You'll get the job done in New York.

16
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,395
There will be a problem.
We have plenty of cattle and there.

17
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,409
Time to move about, and little kid.

18
00:02:48,723 --> 00:02:50,408
Yes, yes yes.

19
00:04:51,276 --> 00:04:52,557
Damn.

20
00:05:01,654 --> 00:05:02,972
Sit down!

21
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,607
Sit down and little kid!

22
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,244
What happened?
-Was a child in the car.

23
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:34,429
Go!

24
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:50,793
I'm done with it.

25
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,820
I can not do that.

26
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:01,284
I can not do that.

27
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,951
Film based on real facts

28
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:20,327
A year later
Australia. Yacc Valley.

29
00:07:04,813 --> 00:07:06,691
Damn!

30
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:19,471
Damn!

31
00:07:40,955 --> 00:07:45,463
You have arrived. This car is so suck
that I can to get my hands on it.

32
00:07:46,002 --> 00:07:48,013
Where is it? -The client still
it has. -What client?

33
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:50,867
Go there now.

34
00:07:52,301 --> 00:07:53,974
All right. Let's go.

35
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:03,205
I know the client and get the EIC.

36
00:08:03,743 --> 00:08:07,256
Before there was a great leader
until he was ousted.

37
00:08:07,774 --> 00:08:09,791
And you live in the desert since.

38
00:08:10,345 --> 00:08:13,374
However, you want to do finish work.

39
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:23,457
And?
- You know the rest. Have you received the package.

40
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:25,759
Yes, I received.

41
00:08:27,714 --> 00:08:31,609
What is the mission.
-I do not have details.

42
00:08:32,086 --> 00:08:36,810
How rich is he?
-Holds $ 6 billion.

43
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:48,128
I the money, do business and leave. You got it?
-Yes.

44
00:08:48,672 --> 00:08:51,947
I finished with him.
-It seems that he has not finished with you.

45
00:08:52,485 --> 00:08:55,663
Danny needs the old one.
Best of the guild.

46
00:08:56,181 --> 00:08:58,270
At the boa's and steel.
Thi remember me?

47
00:08:58,848 --> 00:09:04,685
If you do not work,
Hunter is dead.

48
00:09:11,577 --> 00:09:13,227
I wait.

49
00:10:02,173 --> 00:10:02,853
This way.

50
00:10:02,854 --> 00:10:06,329
- Waiting for your eyes and
nuiascã is ordinary light.

51
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:11,844
Watch here, boy.

52
00:10:14,187 --> 00:10:19,589
My son and forget the rules of desert.
Since the war

53
00:10:19,624 --> 00:10:24,990
was finished, I left
only with this map.

54
00:10:25,487 --> 00:10:29,408
My first son, Hussein,
was slaughtered here ...

55
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,676
decopii before his ...

56
00:10:38,475 --> 00:10:43,974
and here, at the battle of Murhbad brother
His Salim, was wounded and then killed.

57
00:10:45,672 --> 00:10:46,994
Killed ...

58
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:54,525
And then the third son, I was taken ...
Ali ...

59
00:10:57,951 --> 00:11:01,929
Hunted and slaughtered

60
00:11:03,324 --> 00:11:08,659
The law says that the blood of victims and desert
blood must be removed with criminals.

61
00:11:09,197 --> 00:11:13,869
But I refuse revenge and send it
My last son in the war.

62
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,831
I was sent into exile in the desert.

63
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:24,151
I avuþie, wealth, everything I want ...

64
00:11:24,738 --> 00:11:29,832
but I want to go home to my tribe.

65
00:11:30,347 --> 00:11:34,150
But to have it, criminals
my sons to be killed and i.

66
00:11:35,493 --> 00:11:37,179
And you need a hunter for this.

67
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:42,029
There's enough here?
-What would I use it in England?

68
00:11:43,265 --> 00:11:44,281
England?

69
00:11:46,944 --> 00:11:50,776
England and sent dogs to kill my sons.

70
00:11:52,108 --> 00:11:56,862
S.A.S.
Yes, glorious special forces.

71
00:11:57,387 --> 00:12:00,279
Eraþi in the war.
-It was not war England.

72
00:12:00,314 --> 00:12:03,170
They came on my land
and killed my son?

73
00:12:03,674 --> 00:12:09,394
Now will give an account of my law.
Doc says I have 6 months to live.

74
00:12:09,991 --> 00:12:14,891
You must avenge my sons die before
or your friend will die with me.

75
00:12:15,398 --> 00:12:20,150
I do not care how you kill them,
but must recognize the box.

76
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:23,899
And the murders have
appear as an accident.

77
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:26,835
That has to come to my son.

78
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:34,306
That's how he was leaving. Spuenel English as
sfarsii war will be in both parties.

79
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,441
I want to see Hunter.

80
00:12:54,752 --> 00:12:58,117
Danny?
No, no, no.

81
00:12:59,736 --> 00:13:02,945
Get out of here.

82
00:13:07,331 --> 00:13:10,408
Get out of here.
Now, now, now.

83
00:13:10,938 --> 00:13:13,143
You see someone.
I thought the girls.

84
00:13:13,622 --> 00:13:15,865
No?
- And I.

85
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,488
What does that mean?
-I need to put food on the table.

86
00:13:21,955 --> 00:13:25,215
What you and feed you?
6 million, no questions asked?

87
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,018
You must know that it's a trap mission.
Yeah, I know.

88
00:13:29,053 --> 00:13:31,477
How can you not say so,
when I had a ticket?

89
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:35,183
You have accepted the mission,
and I will not leave you here.

90
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:45,431
Give a man a drink.

91
00:13:48,322 --> 00:13:52,673
I've Lisp. I knew every day without you,
is a problem for me.

92
00:13:53,176 --> 00:13:55,321
I was proud when you retired.

93
00:13:56,768 --> 00:13:58,131
Stay out.

94
00:13:58,747 --> 00:14:00,258
Too late.

95
00:14:00,831 --> 00:14:02,701
You should stay away.

96
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:06,998
But I'm faster.

97
00:15:02,845 --> 00:15:04,075
Motherfucker.

98
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,158
What are you doing?
-I take back ceasu.

99
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:36,825
Go, go!

100
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,028
Go to the door.

101
00:16:05,109 --> 00:16:06,867
I need a gun.

102
00:16:15,793 --> 00:16:17,761
Bravo, bravo!

103
00:16:18,302 --> 00:16:19,971
You do not have to shoot them.

104
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:28,888
Nice try.
My father needs her alive.

105
00:16:34,383 --> 00:16:37,625
Nice try.
You know that you found anyway.

106
00:16:42,706 --> 00:16:44,337
All are find.

107
00:16:49,347 --> 00:16:55,111
I know you're þintele, you're everything.
Have you used as bait.

108
00:16:55,146 --> 00:16:59,000
You think I'm so waiting for?

109
00:17:00,471 --> 00:17:04,326
Exit out.
And you, out.

110
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:33,656
I missed you last night at the dance.
-I do not know how to dance.

111
00:17:34,163 --> 00:17:36,683
For without this, try
to make something good out of it.

112
00:17:37,146 --> 00:17:40,817
You have big plans!
-Absolutely.

113
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:50,713
Thi not remember me, right?

114
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,303
Some time has passed.

115
00:17:55,717 --> 00:17:57,044
I am that.

116
00:18:02,078 --> 00:18:03,336
Anne Freizer

117
00:18:03,892 -> 00:18:05,692
And I took pictures in front of the garage.

118
00:18:19,263 -> 00:18:20,026
Paris, France

119
00:18:28,032 --> 00:18:32,315
You owe me a chance.
Thi said that we've met.

120
00:18:34,876 --> 00:18:36,410
We missed you.

121
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:39,620
Yes? Here I am.

122
00:18:41,281 --> 00:18:42,337
You want a piece of me?

123
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,441
Still can.
You're still on top.

124
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:52,223
A real killer.

125
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:05,908
Now depend on it.
It's Hunter-.

126
00:19:07,745 --> 00:19:11,169
Look e.
I will go after S.A.S.

127
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,376
I'm paranoid.
Always have coverage.

128
00:19:24,907 --> 00:19:30,684
I'll try to do to speak. That
will not ever. And four, Danny ...

129
00:19:31,187 --> 00:19:36,175
They are the best.
SEALS are a bunch of bombonele.

130
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:41,163
And besides that,
want it look like an accident.

131
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:43,637
All îþi heaven is thinking about you anymore.

132
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:46,769
Over a day or two, go anyway.

133
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,627
Of course go.
That we do not?

134
00:19:52,611 --> 00:19:58,321
I have something to do. We are in Paris,
and i want to do a game with four.

135
00:19:58,356 --> 00:19:59,874
What? You do not want?

136
00:20:00,355 --> 00:20:05,801
You want this bottle tucked in the anus?
-Are you mad? You want a lollipop?

137
00:20:05,836 --> 00:20:08,016
I would like!
-The grapes or give you n matt?

138
00:20:11,748 --> 00:20:15,818
Are you with us? -Yes.
Why? -6,000,000 Of reasons?

139
00:20:15,853 --> 00:20:19,889
And how it divided?
-After expenses, Jumi-half.

140
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,314
For you two.
-Jumi-half?

141
00:20:22,836 --> 00:20:25,397
But you?
-I have other reasons.

142
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,957
I and producers.
Yes, but stupid.

143
00:20:30,543 --> 00:20:34,466
We located two killer i.
I want you to locate the others.

144
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:40,506
That's one of Murhbad.
This is Douglas Harris.

145
00:20:47,054 --> 00:20:50,441
Meanwhile we must
located. -Lucky? -Danny?

146
00:20:56,767 --> 00:20:57,951
Mu and cat. Oman

147
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:18,795
Harris, you idiot.

148
00:21:20,207 --> 00:21:21,759
Get out!

149
00:21:33,948 --> 00:21:38,086
Comes to you.

150
00:25:31,127 --> 00:25:35,231
I do not know who he is.
I sent to the local.

151
00:25:38,576 --> 00:25:43,150
You have chosen the right man.
- I know not done this for some time.

152
00:25:43,635 --> 00:25:49,563
Protect your ex-SAS.
And you Mike, you're been SAS.

153
00:25:49,598 --> 00:25:52,382
Thi reminds you.
We are back in action.

154
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:56,981
What we do here, is illegal.
You do not have to leave traces.

155
00:25:57,529 --> 00:26:01,610
That's what you call a and a.
It's a little sensitive.

156
00:26:06,489 --> 00:26:13,990
- I lost a good soldier,
- But but the problem is that they believe in SAS.

157
00:26:14,025 --> 00:26:17,475
Someone has to do dirty work.

158
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,986
I have a problem with blood.

159
00:26:20,467 --> 00:26:22,828
But for him? E ink.

160
00:26:23,606 --> 00:26:25,669
Take care that keeps us out of newspapers.

161
00:26:26,138 --> 00:26:28,533
S do and boss!
-We are still in, right?

162
00:26:35,204 --> 00:26:36,588
Lucky.

163
00:26:51,656 --> 00:26:52,769
Where to stay?

164
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:56,218
Staying at the Hilton.
- And I like!

165
00:26:56,253 --> 00:26:59,137
What room?
-Why would you want to you?

166
00:27:16,731 --> 00:27:18,751
What we do here in the middle of nowhere?

167
00:27:18,752 --> 00:27:22,116
You said you hiding? I hid them.
Could be your anus.

168
00:27:22,151 --> 00:27:24,328
You're lucky.
-May shut up.

169
00:27:24,795 --> 00:27:26,684
I appreciate.
-Thank you.

170
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:47,938
You'll love it and your tip here.
Case closed. -Get out of here.

171
00:27:48,382 --> 00:27:52,868
You got it wrong.
-Bitch that's married.

172
00:27:53,424 --> 00:27:57,249
While I've been traso.
-What have you drawn?

173
00:27:58,585 --> 00:28:01,179
It is part of the past.
We are the footsteps of Harris.

174
00:28:09,524 --> 00:28:11,256
What club?
The killer-s.

175
00:28:18,935 --> 00:28:20,105
To do the job.

176
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:22,851
It's a royal jerk.

177
00:28:32,647 --> 00:28:33,603
Damn.

178
00:28:41,431 --> 00:28:43,460
Where will you run?
We are in the midst of desert.

179
00:28:56,961 --> 00:28:58,266
Jump to the other output.

180
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,213
Where is it?

181
00:29:49,763 --> 00:29:51,670
Get out of here.

182
00:29:57,818 --> 00:30:00,723
Someone is on our trail?
-We must move about quickly.

183
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:06,834
Before Harris to find out.
Leave the girl alone. Not involved.

184
00:30:23,842 --> 00:30:25,508
Motherfucker.

185
00:30:36,703 --> 00:30:38,736
You stay quiet.
A talk to me, yes?

186
00:30:42,954 --> 00:30:44,844
What documents I wanted to arãþi?

187
00:30:51,324 --> 00:30:52,852
Have a seat.

188
00:30:54,397 --> 00:30:56,762
Nenorociþii that put you?

189
00:31:23,972 --> 00:31:26,822
What happened.
I have not had enough sun?

190
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:31,298
Hey guys!
Do not say anything until I see lawyers.

191
00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:41,027
Further back.
You killed a man on a mission. Recognize you?

192
00:31:46,686 --> 00:31:47,556
Dispãreþi.

193
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,812
Jokes are you not?
You were in command.

194
00:31:54,647 --> 00:31:58,497
Yes.
-Did you murder a man.

195
00:31:59,028 --> 00:32:02,929
There were witnesses.
You killed him in front of his family.

196
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:11,072
Yes. I got it. I did.

197
00:32:11,593 --> 00:32:13,532
Boards and get me.

198
00:32:14,087 --> 00:32:16,512
Untie me.
-High.

199
00:32:17,113 --> 00:32:19,111
Hey! Gone!

200
00:32:20,643 --> 00:32:26,267
We have what we need.
- And if you say that someone intervened?

201
00:32:27,927 --> 00:32:30,814
His name is?
I do not remember.

202
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:34,478
But it's in the book of the mission.

203
00:32:35,073 --> 00:32:37,108
You'll find him there.

204
00:32:37,682 --> 00:32:39,081
When can you read.

205
00:32:39,571 --> 00:32:40,891
The bathroom.

206
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:51,926
No. He waits. You're an asshole.
D-A-B-I-T-O-C

207
00:32:52,465 --> 00:32:54,813
You're dead.

208
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:57,162
In knee.

209
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:03,282
Put down Capu.

210
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:05,446
're Jokes.
-Stay Nemi and cat.

211
00:33:21,784 --> 00:33:24,419
I need money for taxi.
I have to take a taxi.

212
00:33:24,947 --> 00:33:26,195
I made up.

213
00:33:52,154 --> 00:33:53,714
Case closed.

214
00:34:20,297 --> 00:34:23,719
It seems that your friend gives best.

215
00:34:33,412 --> 00:34:36,904
What do you mean? -Your brother
is dead. You're the only begotten Son ...

216
00:34:38,388 --> 00:34:40,234
Do not you wanted to take revenge.

217
00:34:40,778 -> 00:34:45,086
To tell you your hands soiled.
It would be nice to you and your ordinary rods.

218
00:34:45,741 --> 00:34:49,017
It's no palace where you îndrepþi.
Just a shit hole.

219
00:34:50,484 --> 00:34:53,545
Is the worst nightmare of your.
And will.

220
00:34:55,103 --> 00:34:59,367
And when it does, you will leave here.
And when you'll find in the desert, I pray

221
00:34:59,402 --> 00:35:02,328
God help me target.

222
00:35:21,949 --> 00:35:24,471
What do you think?
-Begins to take shape.

223
00:35:29,741 --> 00:35:32,612
What are you doing for dinner?

224
00:35:44,273 --> 00:35:49,767
Aliens are something exotic here.
-No stranger

225
00:35:49,802 --> 00:35:54,812
But you're exotic.
And something tells me that you told.

226
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:56,969
Yes.

227
00:36:08,924 --> 00:36:10,596
Come! What are you waiting for?

228
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,610
Let's go out.

229
00:36:18,401 --> 00:36:20,257
In many years!

230
00:36:22,242 --> 00:36:23,441
It's a tradition here.

231
00:36:24,832 --> 00:36:26,114
In many years!

232
00:36:49,951 --> 00:36:51,597
Captain Steven Douglas Harris ...

233
00:36:54,281 --> 00:36:55,336
Damn

234
00:37:10,513 --> 00:37:13,803
Not bad at all.
Address is on the back.

235
00:37:14,306 --> 00:37:16,063
I talked to him.

236
00:37:17,314 --> 00:37:21,261
One more thing. My boys have had problems.
-In Oman?

237
00:37:21,717 --> 00:37:22,993
Someone poured.

238
00:37:23,501 --> 00:37:25,313
You have to see who is not?

239
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:28,273
Yes.

240
00:37:37,102 --> 00:37:41,995
Looks better as time
the past. -What? -Photographs.

241
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:45,856
It is not plagiarism?
-Recreate a historical event.

242
00:37:46,335 --> 00:37:47,415
I can see everything.

243
00:37:53,648 --> 00:37:57,018
I have an address for him.
-Are you with SAS?

244
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:58,343
I was.

245
00:37:58,344 --> 00:38:03,125
The best thing would be like to find your address,
is to ...

246
00:38:03,126 --> 00:38:06,011
I spent the last years with this.

247
00:38:06,046 --> 00:38:09,735
And besides that.
We come to you formally.

248
00:38:12,269 --> 00:38:17,864
A I could send someone.
I pay a few minutes?

249
00:38:17,865 --> 00:38:18,363
Yes.

250
00:38:34,495 --> 00:38:38,482
Vrãjeala came with me.
That is part of the regiment said.

251
00:38:38,952 --> 00:38:44,652
I did not he could refuse. Yes.
It's full of vrãjeli.

252
00:39:08,422 --> 00:39:11,161
My informants say that it was canceled.

253
00:39:11,162 --> 00:39:15,271
But someone asked Murhbag.
It must be him.

254
00:39:15,778 --> 00:39:17,508
And what do you do us?

255
00:39:17,543 --> 00:39:18,897
Find it.

256
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:22,116
If not, will I be another murder
and will be one of our boys.

257
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,832
Who are.
-Professionals. That's for sure.

258
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:29,388
If you come after SAS
must be assassins professionals.

259
00:39:29,423 --> 00:39:32,404
Must have some history in the field.

260
00:39:32,439 --> 00:39:35,351
Are unavailable.
I've found in Oman.

261
00:39:35,386 --> 00:39:38,642
Oman?
-People have exceeded our limit there.

262
00:39:38,677 --> 00:39:43,017
Oman? Murhbad should be left alone.
-Need to find "cârtiþa"

263
00:39:44,101 --> 00:39:49,346
He's right.
Cârtiþa must be found.

264
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:54,903
It says that one of the officers SAS
and killed a son of the Murhbad eicului.

265
00:39:55,376 --> 00:40:00,284
Steven Warren Crick.
It was there that night.

266
00:40:00,762 --> 00:40:04,187
It is the biggest nightmare of our own.
Dangerous.

267
00:40:04,222 --> 00:40:05,132
Where did you get that?

268
00:40:05,649 --> 00:40:10,994
The paintings have needed blood.
I killed another officer.

269
00:40:11,029 --> 00:40:16,339
It was part of the business.
-That sort of thing happen.

270
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:19,377
To follow the plan, huh?

271
00:40:20,738 --> 00:40:22,467
Crick. What is?

272
00:40:22,468 --> 00:40:29,961
-I, and spend time in addition to a team.
-Why do not we go there?

273
00:40:30,448 --> 00:40:35,409
No. It was also expected.
Let's see what will happen.

274
00:40:48,598 --> 00:40:55,980
There are 4. We take care of others 3.
You get that celebrity.

275
00:40:56,542 --> 00:40:59,217
E Warren Crick.
Without moving to.

276
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:00,385
He'd wanted to not be.

277
00:41:03,117 --> 00:41:06,430
Welcome to hell.
March and the SAS selection.

278
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:10,890
41 miles, 28 kg of equipment,
May decrease one kg each year.

279
00:41:13,373 --> 00:41:16,512
Do not even thinking about you.
-Why not?

280
00:41:16,547 --> 00:41:19,087
March and this is the most cruel of all the SAS.

281
00:41:19,088 --> 00:41:22,171
Yes? You said it yourself.
Accidents happen.

282
00:41:22,708 --> 00:41:26,448
Do not understand. Try on Monday.
It's not easy.

283
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:29,230
I mean you have to slow down, right?

284
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:36,627
Insulin, ...
Sign here.

285
00:41:46,517 --> 00:41:49,455
He finished.
No, Crick is still there with his mistress.

286
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:53,975
And boss. E pi and at the sea front.

287
00:42:20,148 --> 00:42:22,772
I want you here soon.

288
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:28,965
That once you move.

289
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:44,711
I do not believe it.
Both took care of Crick.

290
00:46:46,832 --> 00:46:49,083
I think those are the same in the desert?
-Can.

291
00:46:49,633 --> 00:46:51,839
It's good. But it was too late.

292
00:46:52,436 --> 00:47:00,425
Good. This is slow and you.
Insulin will make the shock.

293
00:47:01,916 --> 00:47:02,447
Hiportermie.

294
00:47:02,448 --> 00:47:04,660
And how you planned and plant them
drugs?

295
00:47:04,695 --> 00:47:05,747
Before March and.

296
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:14,314
SAS is one thing.
-You have trained him. Think about it.

297
00:47:17,386 --> 00:47:19,365
You're crazy.
Her to do it?

298
00:47:20,873 --> 00:47:23,247
Danny, you're crazy.

299
00:47:31,036 --> 00:47:32,349
SAS. General Headquarters. Hersford

300
00:47:40,059 --> 00:47:42,325
Time is running out.
You, more Putna a minute.

301
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:57,086
We have company.

302
00:49:16,233 --> 00:49:20,135
The trucks!
Go to regiments which aparþineþi!

303
00:49:24,955 --> 00:49:27,538
In trucks. Come!

304
00:49:55,682 --> 00:49:59,441
He drank only half.
It is enough?

305
00:50:00,027 --> 00:50:02,586
Yes. I put much more, right?

306
00:50:26,122 --> 00:50:30,594
îþi remember me?
You killed him?

307
00:50:31,117 --> 00:50:33,778
Yes, I killed.

308
00:50:35,289 --> 00:50:37,272
Danny would not do that.

309
00:50:40,236 --> 00:50:42,934
Your boy does not want to go to the desert.

310
00:50:57,036 --> 00:51:03,055
Today an officer ...

311
00:51:03,582 --> 00:51:07,087
Steven Crick, was found ...

312
00:51:09,651 --> 00:51:12,917
His condition was described as ...

313
00:51:29,351 --> 00:51:30,681
Arãtaþi little respect.

314
00:51:43,003 --> 00:51:44,391
Left corner.

315
00:51:45,014 --> 00:51:46,527
We brought gifts.

316
00:51:51,811 --> 00:51:55,190
In Angola.

317
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:59,101
You do not want to eat those.

318
00:52:02,017 --> 00:52:06,145
Where is our target.
-Another look. Do not worry.

319
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:10,989
But still something. After this
Yes you can work in "full sun".

320
00:52:12,301 --> 00:52:14,071
There's no "after that."

321
00:52:18,685 --> 00:52:21,647
Are intermediate. Looking killer i.

322
00:52:22,217 --> 00:52:30,291
Here's a unique perspective.
Mercenaries, heroes ...

323
00:52:30,326 --> 00:52:33,451
2% of them are part killer.

324
00:52:33,973 --> 00:52:38,620
Therefore you do not cancel.
You can not escape what you're.

325
00:52:41,135 --> 00:52:42,633
That's not what I represent.

326
00:52:44,977 --> 00:52:47,069
And I can do and something else.

327
00:52:47,558 --> 00:52:53,313
Let's talk business.

328
00:52:53,811 --> 00:52:56,704
The third target is Simon Mc? ..

329
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,536
You know where I'll find yourself?

330
00:53:18,158 --> 00:53:20,132
Do not trust him, right?

331
00:53:20,609 --> 00:53:24,708
Mind. -Yes. -I
as they move their lips.

332
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:32,594
Someone tracks. -I want Hunter
out there. I want to end it.

333
00:53:32,629 --> 00:53:34,422
And I want to enjoy my some money.

334
00:53:34,423 --> 00:53:36,969
But first you have to tell you take
a pair of boa and E.

335
00:53:38,305 --> 00:53:40,745
Go after McCan

336
00:53:46,961 --> 00:53:51,452
I miss you. I know not too many
about you, but even so I know.

337
00:53:53,643 --> 00:53:57,090
I am convinced that everything is ok, because
when they are with you, I feel happy.

338
00:53:59,272 --> 00:54:02,291
And then go and realize that
I do not know anything about you.

339
00:54:03,576 --> 00:54:05,796
I do not know where you go, you do.

340
00:54:11,616 --> 00:54:13,814
May you somebody?
I do not. -Then what?

341
00:54:16,405 --> 00:54:18,695
Why not me?
What hide?

342
00:54:19,228 --> 00:54:23,242
I do not want to get into it.
-Damn.

343
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:45,832
What? -If my girlfriend arãþi a
to tell you that can show you shit blood.

344
00:54:46,479 --> 00:54:48,618
Shut up.
-I understand.

345
00:54:51,901 --> 00:54:56,063
He e.
I saw him McCan.

346
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:05,823
Boy, go.
-Carats.

347
00:55:13,847 --> 00:55:21,592
As I said. Can not abþine.
It's a psychopath.

348
00:55:25,041 --> 00:55:26,829
Lord!

349
00:55:31,616 --> 00:55:34,098
Why are you here?

350
00:55:34,629 --> 00:55:37,184
I had a meeting with him to the hospital.

351
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:44,745
Yes.
-Wait.

352
00:55:51,667 --> 00:55:52,485
Let's go.

353
00:56:33,403 --> 00:56:35,825
Mac, I am.
Are you OK?

354
00:56:36,344 --> 00:56:39,292
Yes. Still fresh pieces of skin
on the porch of my house.

355
00:56:39,797 --> 00:56:42,473
Check it out.

356
00:56:55,031 --> 00:56:58,466
The name is Spy Blogen.
It is the next soldier.

357
00:56:58,951 --> 00:57:02,127
Was seen.
Make a hero somewhere.

358
00:57:02,745 --> 00:57:05,731
It does not work and always stands in the house,

359
00:57:08,412 --> 00:57:13,088
You're not who I am? I mean,
Your secrets are small finger.

360
00:57:13,123 --> 00:57:15,420
Do not worry.
-Yes, I worry.

361
00:57:15,919 --> 00:57:19,588
And you should.
Any that make my move, he knew his wait.

362
00:57:20,076 --> 00:57:24,830
You want my opinion.
I think we should break to beat someone.

363
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:27,449
Yes, but nobody asks you.

364
00:57:33,346 --> 00:57:36,473
You had security post, Mr. McCan.

365
00:57:36,997 --> 00:57:40,039
I found through a mutual friend
SAS.

366
00:57:41,312 --> 00:57:44,407
See you Tuesday at 5.10 pm

367
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:47,177
Only expected.
-See you. -Okay.

368
00:57:49,317 --> 00:57:52,335
Will be there.
-Okay. I do not understand.

369
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:58,792
McCan and lives here.
Will be here for the interview.

370
00:57:59,207 --> 00:58:04,870
I go on here.
"Boston brakes"

371
00:58:05,534 --> 00:58:07,566
Perfect.
-It was not perfect like that in Boston.

372
00:58:07,601 --> 00:58:09,599
I lost control.
-Should be in 10 days.

373
00:58:10,139 --> 00:58:14,510
10 days?
I need some help.

374
00:58:15,089 --> 00:58:20,472
All right. -McCan is supervised.
How do you do to recognize.

375
00:58:20,507 --> 00:58:23,483
We will not get.
We make a false one.

376
00:58:27,474 --> 00:58:30,047
We play where we recognize and pause.

377
00:58:47,117 --> 00:58:51,701
Who are you? I'm not flying with
helicopter and a gun in your pocket.

378
00:58:52,138 --> 00:58:54,631
I can call Mifwich.
-Mifwich ...

379
00:58:54,666 --> 00:58:59,383
Son of a bitch who is in command.
We have questions.

380
00:59:00,009 --> 00:59:08,199
About this club illegal.

381
00:59:12,134 --> 00:59:15,994
I know it's not in the calendar ...
Imadiat talk to you.

382
00:59:22,361 --> 00:59:25,681
McCan watching it.
All goes smoothly.

383
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:30,087
I know it's a friend McCan
of yours, but what business has he with us?

384
00:59:33,351 --> 00:59:36,696
This is a chance to catch those
who killed and Greg Harris.

385
00:59:36,731 --> 00:59:42,202
The authorities have found new evidence in this
case. -What words are you? Everything is here!

386
00:59:46,843 --> 00:59:49,662
Everybody in this room
I know they were omorâþi.

387
00:59:50,875 --> 00:59:53,807
Everyone knows that McCan will be next.

388
00:59:54,254 --> 00:59:56,104
Enough.
-Have to do something.

389
00:59:56,139 --> 00:59:59,629
You could move to action.
Yes, but that still means committee.

390
01:00:01,961 --> 01:00:03,603
Should not you waiting for.

391
01:00:18,952 --> 01:00:20,720
Spike.
-It was a trap.

392
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:23,381
I sent away.
You knew that would happen.

393
01:00:25,029 --> 01:00:28,020
Listen to me.
-Is much greater than you think.

394
01:00:29,164 --> 01:00:34,235
Office a lot of questions.
I reputaþii device.

395
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:37,093
Do not do this to occur reputaþii ...

396
01:00:37,128 --> 01:00:44,464
I can not withdraw. I can not.
-Understand that he will deny it?

397
01:00:44,499 --> 01:00:47,418
Only you and your depsre this
and orders come to you.

398
01:00:47,419 --> 01:00:47,702
And?

399
01:00:48,246 --> 01:00:52,739
If something happens,
answer for everything.

400
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:53,982
For all?

401
01:00:54,531 --> 01:00:58,820
I'm done with this commission.

402
01:01:00,402 --> 01:01:01,884
You'll find them.

403
01:01:04,546 --> 01:01:05,953
It's nice. Do not worry.

404
01:01:08,455 --> 01:01:10,597
He knows that we aþã?
Yes, yes, yes.

405
01:01:28,806 --> 01:01:31,960
Tell your folks,
that they send my love.

406
01:01:32,463 --> 01:01:36,714
Danny?
-This is your first mission?

407
01:01:43,487 --> 01:01:47,221
In my first move I was a moron une.
-I will be good at it.

408
01:01:47,767 --> 01:01:49,124
Killing is easy.

409
01:01:50,178 --> 01:01:55,336
Killing is easy,
the hard part is it as and Tigi.

410
01:02:00,278 --> 01:02:07,724
If you see him, your ad.
-Can you spread them and you.

411
01:02:08,185 --> 01:02:11,763
I'll be careful.

412
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:19,484
We arrived.

413
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:21,632
A delayed.

414
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:28,297
Sit at 10-15 m distance and
Keep my desktop.

415
01:03:16,214 --> 01:03:18,230
Where do you get license Thi?

416
01:03:21,125 --> 01:03:24,563
It's behind me. Go with 60.

417
01:03:30,277 --> 01:03:32,821
You'll have eye contact
with Danny in a minute.

418
01:03:36,567 --> 01:03:39,767
Stay with him Jake.
-Yes.

419
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:46,814
Target entered.
-Get behind him.

420
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:50,062
Enters. -I
place. -Push him.

421
01:03:51,435 --> 01:04:00,935
What are you doing? -Do not miss.
-One to operate rear.

422
01:04:01,498 --> 01:04:04,569
Davis give one to tell you the data.

423
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,665
400 meters.

424
01:04:13,426 --> 01:04:15,164
All right. Tell me the distance.

425
01:04:19,057 --> 01:04:20,280
300 meters.

426
01:04:26,602 --> 01:04:28,120
200 meters.

427
01:04:32,992 --> 01:04:33,859
Vine.

428
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:36,580
100 meters.

429
01:04:46,898 --> 01:04:50,089
Now!

430
01:04:50,667 --> 01:04:53,896
Braking. Braking.

431
01:05:03,091 --> 01:05:04,802
We got him!

432
01:05:05,297 --> 01:05:07,810
He's dead. E Elvis.

433
01:05:17,052 --> 01:05:19,378
You got it.
-Machine stops.

434
01:05:20,885 --> 01:05:22,659
We must be sure that he died.

435
01:05:38,875 --> 01:05:40,088
Bring it to me.

436
01:05:42,784 --> 01:05:45,610
Have you been, man.

437
01:05:47,057 --> 01:05:49,712
Too easy.
-Davis, tell me something new.

438
01:05:52,095 --> 01:05:54,315
Comes quickly.

439
01:05:55,675 --> 01:05:59,337
Jump to the left.
-Keep going.

440
01:06:02,539 --> 01:06:04,110
Come pal.

441
01:06:08,987 --> 01:06:12,325
Davis, where are you?
Gotcha, you bastards.

442
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:17,354
Damn.
-Let go!

443
01:06:20,721 --> 01:06:23,733
Vine.

444
01:06:25,904 --> 01:06:27,819
Exit the car!

445
01:06:28,556 --> 01:06:32,496
How the hell apãreþi? -U and URELIT.
-Stay away from the car!

446
01:06:33,086 --> 01:06:36,934
Slowly.

447
01:06:37,505 --> 01:06:38,117
No, no, no ...

448
01:07:08,883 --> 01:07:10,430
It has no papers.

449
01:07:10,995 --> 01:07:13,492
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

450
01:07:14,918 --> 01:07:18,106
Who the hell is?

451
01:07:18,697 --> 01:07:22,058
This should not happen.
-U and URELIT, Danny.

This.
-Yes. I'm done.

458
01:08:32,668 --> 01:08:35,717
To be safe.
- And you Davis.

459
01:08:43,964 --> 01:08:47,226
Sergeant, still seek him on ...

460
01:09:17,979 --> 01:09:21,650
Thank you. If there's something else ...
-Room service.

461
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:23,978
Something exotic.

462
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:48,501
Yes.
I found him.

463
01:09:49,962 --> 01:09:51,221
Are you sure it's him?

464
01:09:51,711 --> 01:09:52,564
Yes, I'm sure.

465
01:10:27,716 --> 01:10:29,434
Ridcate. Coated.
That motion!

466
01:10:32,970 --> 01:10:35,927
Stay put there, understand?

467
01:10:36,439 --> 01:10:42,209
It comes with McCan. And Canela.
Where is the bastard?

468
01:10:42,745 --> 01:10:44,281
I never heard of him.

469
01:10:46,973 --> 01:10:50,007
So like that's gonna be.

470
01:10:51,719 --> 01:10:54,414

-Well done.

472
01:11:00,071 --> 01:11:02,148
Only expected to meet him miserable.

473

481
01:12:18,809 --> 01:12:20,580

Drop the gun.

486
01:12:53,308 --> 01:12:54,706
With his left hand.

487
01:12:55,217 --> 01:12:57,801
On the floor.

488
01:13:04,452 --> 01:13:06,255
Push it to my foot.

489
01:13:09,643 -> 01:13:12,439

493
01:13:23,759 --> 01:13:27,522
He was my friend?
Yeah? And my McCan.

494
01:13:30,329 --> 01:13:39,234
Davis, Greg, Harriss ...

495
01:13:39,658 --> 01:13:43,584
Do not use it and add yours.

496
01:13:46,932 --> 01:13:49,812
Who are you?
-No matter.

497
01:13:51,154 --> 01:13:54,463
For you, there is.
What does that mean?

498
01:13:54,498 --> 01:13:56,741

Without uniform, war, particularly ...
It's my duty.

Yes, Carl.
That number. That was work.

How did you get this number?

534
01:18:12,379 --> 01:18:15,362
Please, Danny.
No sounds of professionalism.

535
01:18:16,862 --> 01:18:20,245
What do you want?
-We have a problem with the mission.

536
01:18:23,846 --> 01:18:29,302
I'm done. Who did you kill it
not. The left one.

537
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:34,758
And besides that, I want 10%.
I do not. I did the right thing.

538
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:38,022
Tell that and eicului.
He wants to talk with his son.

539
01:18:38,853 --> 01:18:42,094
Check Thi friends, before
to do things hastily.

540
01:19:54,316 --> 01:19:56,601
What are you doing?
Come to bed.

541
01:20:01,274 --> 01:20:04,934
Come with me. Paris.
-What?

542
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:08,000
I'd expect there until
where I come from London.

543
01:20:11,746 --> 01:20:15,592
We are in the middle of the night ...
They know you.

544
01:20:16,123 --> 01:20:20,060
How to know about me.
-Us.

545
01:20:54,284 --> 01:20:57,368
When will it end?
-Soon.

546
01:21:33,758 --> 01:21:37,972
Take care of it.
-Listen. Do not do this one alone.

547
01:21:38,513 --> 01:21:44,858
Not a one.
-Let's do this both.

548
01:21:44,893 --> 01:21:47,111
We have an understanding.
Îþi remember me?

549
01:21:47,652 --> 01:21:50,197
No longer do that?
Come on, man.

550
01:21:50,232 --> 01:21:53,155
You need to know safe.
Are you one of trust.

551
01:21:53,673 --> 01:21:57,592
Vrãjealã. Both. Come!

552
01:21:58,875 --> 01:22:01,843
You'll be killed.

553
01:22:06,743 --> 01:22:08,795
Thanks for doing this.

554
01:22:09,314 --> 01:22:11,068
I think the jokes you're with me.

555
01:23:05,231 --> 01:23:07,912
Do not give me the money
I'll put in your eyes.

556
01:23:08,402 -> 01:23:14,246
Another soldier killed my brother.
-No, that was.

557
01:23:14,663 --> 01:23:18,604
Do you think it's a joke?
-This is the book published.

558
01:23:19,086 --> 01:23:21,265
All served in the SAS.

559
01:23:22,524 --> 01:23:25,205
It has created an ambush
when he was killed.

560
01:23:26,546 --> 01:23:30,765
Harris did not killed Hussein.

561
01:23:32,193 --> 01:23:36,510
You told me it's him.

562
01:23:37,993 --> 01:23:44,896
You're so delicate.
-Soft? I've killed a man.

563
01:23:45,478 --> 01:23:49,059
In the book you'll see religion.

564
01:23:50,475 --> 01:23:54,311
And Dad ...
- I know what needs Tactual.

565
01:24:06,938 --> 01:24:11,780
Harris did not killed Hussein.
Yes, all of SAS e.

566
01:24:26,048 --> 01:24:32,138
Where peci?
I have customers. Q and push the book in Oman.

567
01:24:32,865 --> 01:24:35,497
Will make a press release Tuesday.

568
01:24:37,048 --> 01:24:37,483
Tuesday.

569
01:24:37,484 --> 01:24:40,894
I know it's in short
but I had no choice.

570
01:24:42,312 --> 01:24:45,450
I'll do this alone.
-Are you sure?

571
01:24:49,171 --> 01:24:50,409
I think it is.

572
01:25:01,398 --> 01:25:02,198
I knew you'll find here.

573
01:25:19,816 --> 01:25:23,929
Arãþi loner.
You're his friend, Danny?

574
01:25:26,031 --> 01:25:28,726
Hunter.
Said good things about me?

575
01:25:28,761 --> 01:25:32,200
What are you doing here?
-I take care of you.

576
01:25:32,754 --> 01:25:36,055
Had to be with him.
E.-A and did not want him.

577
01:25:36,546 --> 01:25:38,164
He wanted to take care of you.

578
01:25:40,412 --> 01:25:42,856
For what?
-For you.

579
01:25:45,089 --> 01:25:48,248
Do you think that's not coming back.
What happens after that?

580
01:25:49,526 --> 01:25:52,073
I have a wife.
I know the look.

581
01:25:53,481 --> 01:25:56,937
We we know for 10 years.
Danny and me ...

582
01:25:56,972 --> 01:26:00,393
wife loves it, kids love it ...

583
01:26:00,862 --> 01:26:02,887
up and wild animals
I like Danny.

584
01:26:04,253 --> 01:26:08,204
Yes.
I know that will come after you.

585
01:26:09,552 --> 01:26:11,855
And when it does, you will steal.

586
01:26:13,197 --> 01:26:17,862
Where are you that's the plan?

587
01:26:23,566 --> 01:26:25,197
Querying a woman now.

588
01:26:35,283 --> 01:26:37,572
The guy's good.
Very good.

589
01:26:37,607 --> 01:26:40,845
If you feel something,
Do not put the corner and will fight.

590
01:26:41,337 --> 01:26:46,541
It ends today.

591
01:27:20,927 --> 01:27:23,545
And boss. E at the entrance.
I think he is.

592
01:27:31,995 --> 01:27:33,870
May be it.

593
01:27:50,208 --> 01:27:54,291
Climb the stairs.
-Stay on positions. I'm not sure.

594
01:28:22,982 --> 01:28:27,650
I got it.
I do not grasp.

595
01:28:29,176 --> 01:28:31,417
Stay here.

596
01:28:46,711 --> 01:28:47,622
Damn.

597
01:28:50,579 --> 01:28:53,354
Face the wall.

598
01:28:55,994 --> 01:28:58,184
Be careful with that.

599
01:29:38,263 --> 01:29:39,955
I've found.
Heading for the roof.

600
01:30:07,078 --> 01:30:09,875
Heading for the roof.

601
01:30:38,838 --> 01:30:41,536
Jump, jump!

602
01:31:12,495 --> 01:31:14,467
E in motion. Let's go!

603
01:32:01,565 --> 01:32:04,257
Do not do it.

604
01:32:07,117 --> 01:32:10,528
I do not see, and boss.

605
01:32:10,982 --> 01:32:11,909
He disappeared.

606
01:32:25,686 --> 01:32:27,944
That move and you die.

607
01:32:30,416 --> 01:32:32,519
Let's go, let's go.

608
01:32:57,681 --> 01:33:00,977
What's this?

609
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:08,426
This is for the camera.
This is for Crick.

610
01:33:10,009 --> 01:33:12,897
I just started.
Give him the mask down.

611
01:33:15,604 --> 01:33:16,771
Expect Thi out, boys.

612
01:33:27,165 --> 01:33:29,568
Why is it still alive.
Why do not you kill him?

613
01:33:31,126 --> 01:33:34,772
Why ask me that?
I thought you guys you are good!

614
01:33:34,807 --> 01:33:38,301
Who are you?
Who are you working?

615
01:33:39,555 --> 01:33:42,008
We have much in common.
-Really?

616
01:33:42,482 --> 01:33:48,164
Do you? You sit there connected
chair, gun in hand I here,

617
01:33:48,571 --> 01:33:52,557
and I will say what the hell is happening?

618
01:33:54,003 --> 01:33:58,220
What happened.
Do you think it over?

619
01:33:58,819 --> 01:34:02,287
Will send someone else.
And you will kill them all.

620
01:34:11,897 --> 01:34:15,606
Pull the trigger.

621
01:34:16,122 --> 01:34:20,376
I stopped you, I stopped them.
-I wanted to kill him.

622
01:34:20,863 --> 01:34:25,969
But they will. If you put that on
Whose hands have all been completed.

623
01:34:26,497 --> 01:34:28,140
- Camera. Why?
-Evidence.

624
01:34:29,308 --> 01:34:31,121
Evidence that is dead.

625
01:34:32,363 --> 01:34:34,473
It is the only way you can save.

626
01:34:35,841 --> 01:34:39,246
If you and I to go,
îþi say where he will find.

627
01:34:41,581 --> 01:34:42,624
All right.

628
01:34:44,296 --> 01:34:48,722
Leave.
And eicul Amir.

629
01:34:49,978 --> 01:34:51,819
You find yourself in Oman.
Why?

630
01:34:52,316 --> 01:34:57,028
The war.
I killed three of his sons.

631
01:35:04,215 --> 01:35:05,669
No.

632
01:35:13,649 --> 01:35:15,536
Cause I'm a good boy.

633
01:35:23,457 --> 01:35:24,082
Throw it.

634
01:35:31,288 --> 01:35:32,566
In.

635
01:35:39,487 --> 01:35:42,088
The side. In knee.

636
01:35:52,890 --> 01:35:59,160
You've burned. I do not know much about
you. I care only for action.

637
01:36:00,464 --> 01:36:02,998
Never what you're fighting.

638
01:36:04,328 --> 01:36:05,442
Or for whom.

639
01:36:06,860 --> 01:36:09,074
You will never see
true true.

640
01:36:13,492 --> 01:36:15,686
You are the one who was a trap.

641
01:36:16,194 --> 01:36:18,269
He could not give out.

642
01:36:20,676 --> 01:36:23,399
Majestãþii Government its
does not like secret societies.

643
01:36:24,629 --> 01:36:26,690
Especially when there are
agreement with our interests.

644
01:36:27,835 --> 01:36:31,382
You know how that desert oil and produces bitter?

645
01:36:32,726 --> 01:36:35,705
You know how the contract worth?
-3 Months of life.

646
01:36:36,193 --> 01:36:40,116
A and E. A and the E!

647
01:36:40,710 --> 01:36:43,183
We send her killer.
He and solve its job.

648
01:36:43,184 --> 01:36:47,054
And you need to sign
contracts, and we consider eicul.

649
01:36:48,328 --> 01:36:50,650
Motherfucker, you're a ...
... Patriot.

650
01:36:51,106 --> 01:36:54,403
I and serves as home to and the
made three who died.

651
01:36:54,907 --> 01:36:56,936
Just as you do and you.

652
01:38:26,397 --> 01:38:27,645
Here it is!

653
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:31,838
Danny disappeared.
But one thing's for sure.

654
01:38:32,435 --> 01:38:33,882
Will come after her.

655
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:39,148
We come to the door that the $ 6 million,
and it will not be there.

656
01:38:39,620 --> 01:38:43,332
And who will take the 10%.
I.

657
01:38:44,845 --> 01:38:46,801
And boss?

658
01:38:50,806 --> 01:38:51,491
Occupied by him.

659
01:40:08,601 --> 01:40:12,114
It was not personal.
Just business.

660
01:40:13,393 --> 01:40:16,031
We've played on the fingers.

661
01:40:16,475 --> 01:40:21,319
Vreasa not know why,
so that you can kill.

662
01:40:25,785 --> 01:40:32,525
The game is over.

663
01:40:40,495 --> 01:40:47,326
If you're on their trail, you'll find.
Anyone can be found.

664
01:40:48,462 --> 01:40:49,574
Even you.

665
01:41:03,472 --> 01:41:08,261
Are you here to finish this
for all. You got it?

666
01:41:08,296 --> 01:41:09,274
That's why I'm here.

667
01:41:09,309 --> 01:41:12,375
But you?
-Maybe it was over, and little kid.

668
01:41:14,712 --> 01:41:17,864
Who says? -I. Do not we risk
no. Let's be serio-and i.

669
01:41:17,899 --> 01:41:21,693
Serio and? -You went into a trap last night.
You think I let you do it again?

670
01:41:22,164 --> 01:41:27,543
I said I'll come back to it.
Want to seem false?

671
01:41:27,578 --> 01:41:32,923
You have to watch remotely.
-It is nice.

672
01:41:34,276 --> 01:41:37,577
Do not know, right?
-I.

673
01:41:38,073 --> 01:41:42,117
It will be difficult.
Life is a shit with chocolate on top.

674
01:41:42,563 --> 01:41:45,627
What does this mean?
To talk about good times and bad ...

675
01:41:46,096 --> 01:41:48,952
It seems that it has changed
life in both.

676
01:41:49,525 --> 01:41:50,532
To finish this.

677
01:41:51,709 --> 01:41:55,592
I'll cover the top.
If something goes wrong, come to you.

678
01:41:56,067 --> 01:41:58,959
You want to end eicul
it. Give him the pictures. Yeah?

679
01:41:59,407 --> 01:42:03,389
Do not be a problem.
-From your mouth to the ears of the Lord.

680
01:42:03,913 --> 01:42:05,917
Do not move until you say to me, yes?

681
01:42:26,365 --> 01:42:29,986
Who are you?
What do you want?

682
01:42:31,379 --> 01:42:34,707
The photos.

683
01:42:36,132 --> 01:42:38,818
I'd like to see things completed.

684
01:42:50,173 --> 01:42:55,044
Take these my people.
Show them what I did.

685
01:42:57,495 --> 01:42:59,931
I have a message and EIC.

686
01:43:05,688 --> 01:43:09,320
It's still alive.

687
01:43:10,984 --> 01:43:12,923
Are false.

688
01:43:16,023 --> 01:43:18,444
An only slightly.

689
01:43:32,607 --> 01:43:34,260
I do not care.

690
01:43:36,723 --> 01:43:42,575
What can I do ...
in the desert and forgotten by God?

691
01:43:48,445 --> 01:43:53,485
Do not you forgotten something?

692
01:44:06,475 --> 01:44:08,896
Wait. Stay there.

693
01:44:09,537 --> 01:44:10,576
Something is wrong.

694
01:44:18,695 --> 01:44:21,192
See that?
-Yes.

695
01:44:27,216 --> 01:44:29,645
We are in the wrong place.

696
01:45:30,635 --> 01:45:32,252
Relax.
I killed the car.

697
01:46:15,823 --> 01:46:17,410
You again.

698
01:46:24,661 --> 01:46:29,630
At the palace.
What happened there?

699
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:33,727
Expect a message from you.

700
01:46:34,261 --> 01:46:35,397
I was the messenger.

701
01:46:35,953 --> 01:46:37,812
And?
-What do you think?

702
01:46:39,221 --> 01:46:43,653
He's dead. I do not care.
It will not return to the desert.

703
01:46:45,131 --> 01:46:46,675
It was all for nothing.

704
01:46:47,301 --> 01:46:49,842
It's not fair.

705
01:47:00,895 --> 01:47:02,419
And winning the winner is ...

706
01:47:03,940 --> 01:47:05,783
That's what it is.
-Yes.

707
01:47:06,337 --> 01:47:11,076
Do not understand, right?

708
01:47:13,453 --> 01:47:15,170
Are you sure?

709
01:47:19,934 --> 01:47:21,060
Need to cover my expenses.

710
01:47:23,383 --> 01:47:26,602
You can not return to England.
Not after you've killed and EIC.

711
01:47:26,637 --> 01:47:30,027
Who the hell are you?
-I? A voice of experience.

712
01:47:30,062 --> 01:47:32,966
Where will we go? What will you do?
You'll need to knew.

713
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:35,900
New name. New girl. Acts in November.

714
01:47:36,453 --> 01:47:38,530
You'll see.

715
01:47:52,907 --> 01:47:57,152
Do you think you can escape?
-No escape.

716
01:47:58,399 --> 01:48:00,508
No one.

717
01:48:01,922 --> 01:48:07,630
Old man whom you killed.
Did not choose a party that war.

718
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:10,694
Îþi say now. It is over for me.
-Really?

719
01:48:11,189 --> 01:48:13,838
I'd like to say just
and that you live up to deep bãtrâneþi.

720
01:48:14,355 --> 01:48:19,206
It's your choice. -I still say that the war
I was finished. They say that eating shit.

721
01:48:19,241 --> 01:48:20,660
And îþi and Thiele say the same.

722
01:48:21,174 --> 01:48:23,832
At and A and a.

723
01:48:29,374 --> 01:48:30,890
Where are you going?

724
01:48:31,448 --> 01:48:34,505
We plan and you visit me?
-No never know.

725
01:48:37,141 --> 01:48:40,595
If you, I'll be waiting.

726
01:48:46,608 --> 01:48:48,930
Îþi we call a taxi to the airport.

727
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:20,550
You are Danny, the boy who ran away?
-Yes.

728
01:49:21,011 --> 01:49:22,430
I returned.

729
01:49:22,988 --> 01:49:27,092
Where are you going?
I do not know.

730
01:49:27,597 --> 01:49:28,918
Neither do I.

731
01:49:29,427 --> 01:49:30,579
We can go together?

732
01:49:30,614 --> 01:49:36,392
