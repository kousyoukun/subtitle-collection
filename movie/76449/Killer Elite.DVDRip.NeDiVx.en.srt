1
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,830
Hey kiddo, what are you doing?

2
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,130
I buy you a fancy Mexican meal
and you're feeding it to a mutt.

3
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,130
Real fancy.

4
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,330
Have you any idea what that is?

5
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,330
What?

6
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,030
- Tree chicken.
- What?

7
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,330
That's what the locals call it.

8
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,430
Colds, headaches, hangovers.
Cures anything.

9
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,930
Iguana. That's what they say.

10
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,830
What about indigestion?

11
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,430
Fucking iguana taco.

12
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,830
Yeah well, you had it in Salvador.

13
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,730
Yeah, and that was shit.

14
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,430
What about Angola?
The food was good there right?

15
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,730
Shit.

16
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,430
Yeah? Rhodesia?

17
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,030
Shit.

18
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,030
- Hamburg?
- Shit.

19
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,730
So if it's not New York it's...

20
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,130
You got it. Shit.

21
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,230
Look at you wasting away.

22
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,230
We got to get a job in New York.

23
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,930
That won't be a problem.
Plenty of assholes there.

24
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,630
Time to move kiddo.

25
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:34,730
Oops.

27
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,330
Fuck!

28
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,030
Stay down!

29
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,430
Stay down kid!

30
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:30,730
What happened?!

31
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,130
- There was a kid in the car.
- What?!

32
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,030
There was a kid in the car.

33
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,230
Go, go, go, go!

34
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,330
Fuck!

35
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,130
I'm done with this. I'm finished.

36
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,430
I can't do this anymore.

37
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,930
I can't do this.

38
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,030
Oh, shit!

39
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,430
Shit.

40
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:41,730
Danny, get in.

41
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,230
These camel-jockeys have got diseases
I don't want to think about.

42
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,430
Where is he?

43
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,730
The Client still has him.

44
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,130
What Client?

45
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,230
We're going there now.

46
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,230
Okay, drive.

47
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,530
So the client's an oil sheikh, no less.

48
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,930
Used to rule some huge stretch

49
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,330
of desert 'til his tribe kicked him out.

50
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,830
Been living here in exile ever since.

51
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,730
Anyway, sheikhy was loaded
and he wanted a job done.

52
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,230
Hunter took the contract, then he ran.

53
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,430
They caught him at the airport.

54
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,630
And?

55
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,030
You know the rest. You got the package.

56
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,030
Yeah, I got it. What's the job?

57
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,630
It just came with a price tag
no details. Hunter took it cold.

58
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,130
Why would he do that?

59
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,830
Six million dollars. A big score, Danny.

60
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,630
Too bloody big for Hunter.

61
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,930
Yeah. Well, why'd you offer it to him.

62
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,730
He wanted the money and you were out.
Remember?

63
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,030
Yeah. Still am.

64
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,730
I'm done with killing.

65
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,330
Yeah well maybe killing ain't done
with you.

66
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,530
Hunter needs the old Danny,
the best in the biz.

67
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,030
The one with balls of steel.

68
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,030
You remember him, right.

69
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,030
Look, it comes down to this...

70
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,130
you don't do this job,
Hunter's a dead man.

71
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,430
They're waiting for you.

72
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,430
This way.

73
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,430
He is waiting for his eyes to adjust.

74
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,230
Be careful around this one, boy.

75
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,930
My son forgets the ways of the desert.

76
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,230
Since our war against the Sultan,

77
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:24,330
all he has had of his homeland is
this paint. Plaster.

78
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:30,130
My first son, Hussein,
was slaughtered here.

79
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,830
Shot before his children.

80
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,530
And here, at the battle of Mirbat

81
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:46,630
his brother, Salim, was wounded
and then killed. Murdered.

82
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:54,530
And then my third son was taken
from me. Ali.

83
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,030
Hunted down and slaughtered.

84
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,730
The law of the desert says
the blood of the victim

85
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,930
must be washed away
by the blood of the killers,

86
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,930
but I refused revenge

87
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:14,230
and saved my last son,
Bakhait, from the war.

88
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:17,230
So I was exiled to this desert.

89
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:21,130
I have wealth, power

90
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,530
but rich men die too.

91
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,630
When I die,

92
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,030
I want Bakhait to go home to my tribe.

93
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,130
But for that to happen,

94
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,330
the killers of my sons must be killed.

95
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,530
You don't need me or Hunter for this.

96
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,230
You've got all the men you need.

97
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,930
What use would my men be in England?

98
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,330
England?

99
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,430
The English sent their fiercest dogs

100
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,930
to kill for a Sultan's oil!

101
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,230
The SAS?

102
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:57,230
Yes, their glorious special forces.

103
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,130
It was a war!

104
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,830
It was not England's war!

105
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:05,530
They came to my land, murdered my sons,
now they will face my law!

106
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:09,930
The doctors say
I have six months left to live.

107
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,530
You must avenge my sons before I die,

108
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,930
or your friend will die with me.

109
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,330
I don't care how you kill the killers,

110
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:20,030
but they will admit their guilt on tape.

111
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,730
And their deaths must look like
accidents.

112
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,730
This must not lead back to my son.

113
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,030
So go.

114
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:34,630
Show the English a war isn't over
'til both sides say it is.

115
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,230
I want to see Hunter.

116
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,530
Oh, Danny,

117
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,930
no Danny, no, no, no, no.

118
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,430
What are you doing here?
Get out of here.

119
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,330
You all right?

120
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,230
Am I all right? Yeah, I'm all right.

121
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,030
You got to go. Get away from here.
Go, go, go, go.

122
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,330
I'm not here for you anyway.

123
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,030
I was thinking about
the girls and Celine.

124
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,030
Me too, me too.

125
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,830
What's that supposed to mean?

126
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,730
It's tough putting food on the table.

127
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:25,030
What are you feeding them?
Six million, no questions?

128
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:25,730
Well.

129
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,730
You must've known
that was a bullshit job.

130
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:31,430
Yeah, I know. Fucking SAS,
a one-way ticket for sure.

131
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,130
Well, you took the job
and I'm not leaving you here.

132
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,630
Hey! Get this man a drink.

133
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:48,830
I missed you.

134
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:49,530
Well, I didn't miss you.

135
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,630
Every day you were out of this game
was a good day for me.

136
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,230
I was proud of you when you got out.

137
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,130
Stay out.

138
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,430
Too late.

139
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,030
You should have stayed away.

140
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,730
Or run faster.

141
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,030
Sonofabitch.

142
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,130
What are you doing?
Let me get my watch back.

143
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,330
Go! Go!

144
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,630
Go! Go! Get the door.

145
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,630
Get the door!

146
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,030
Give me the gun!

147
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,730
Bravo. Bravo.

148
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:21,130
If you need to be shot,
I'll happily oblige.

149
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,830
I'm sorry, kiddo.

150
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,530
My father needs him alive.

151
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,730
Nice try.

152
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,430
You know they'd have found you.

153
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,630
Everybody gets found.

154
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,530
Oh!

155
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,230
Agh!

156
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,830
You knew!

157
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:53,130
My gut tells me you knew the target
and you knew Hunter wouldn't take it!

158
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,430
You used him as bait.

159
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,530
That's a lot of angles,

160
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,630
Danny. You think I'm that smart?

161
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:00,930
Get out.

162
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,330
And you, out.

163
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,930
We missed you at the dance last night.

164
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,330
I'm not much of a dancer.

165
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,530
Besides, I'm still trying to find out
how much house is under this.

166
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,330
Right. Big plans.

167
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,530
Yeah, maybe too big.

168
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,830
You don't remember me, do you?

169
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,330
Yeah, well. It's been a while.

170
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,830
I'm Anne Frazer.

171
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,030
Anne Frazer?

172
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,530
Anne had red hair full of grass.

173
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,930
Yeah!

174
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,730
And weird red gumboots.

175
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,730
With eyes on them. Oh my God!

176
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,330
Oi, you owe me fifty quid.

177
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,130
Told you he'd be back, didn't I?

178
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,130
We missed you.

179
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,130
Yeah? Well here I am.

180
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,930
All right then, do you want some?

181
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,630
Yeah, mate, you still got it.

182
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,030
You still got that edge.

183
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,530
You're a real killer!

184
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,830
Come on, let's talk.

185
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,230
While you were away,
you didn't start a family, did you?

186
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,430
No.

187
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,330
So no one's depending on you.

188
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,930
Only Hunter.

189
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,430
Only Hunter.

190
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,130
Because one

191
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,330
you're going after the SAS.

192
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:14,430
They're a paranoid bunch.
They've always got their back up.

193
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,630
Two. You need info on Oman.

194
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,730
No one talks about Oman.

195
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,030
They went in there as advisers
and ended up fighting the fucking war.

196
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,530
Real hush-hush, semi-mercenary stuff.

197
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,830
Three. You need confessions.

198
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:26,930
They're trained to resist torture,

199
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,230
so no matter what you say or do,
they'll say nothing.

200
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,930
And four, Danny,

201
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,130
this is the best Special Forces Regiment
in the world.

202
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,830
They make the Navy Seals look like
a bunch of cupcakes and not only that,

203
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,330
you're trying to take down
three of their geezers

204
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,330
and make it look like an accident.

205
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,830
All I'm asking is give it some thought.

206
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:47,430
Take a day, more if you want.
I'm going anyway.

207
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,030
Course I'm in, you silly bastard.

208
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,630
It's what we do, right?

209
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,530
Anyway, I got a score to settle
with them.

210
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,130
I tried out for them
when I was in the Paras.

211
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,530
Did Hereford, the whole fucking lot!

212
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,130
What? And they wouldn't have you.

213
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,230
You want this bottle shoved up your ass?

214
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,430
Are you upset? Would you like a lolly?

215
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,030
I'd love a lolly.

216
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,630
Strawberry, or fuck you?

217
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,130
Meier.

218
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,430
In.

219
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,630
Why?

220
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,930
Ah, six million reasons.

221
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,930
So what's the split?

222
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:20,930
After the Agent takes his slice,
fifty-fifty between you two.

223
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,230
Fifty-fifty? How about you?

224
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,530
I'm in this for Hunter.

225
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,030
How wonderfully touching.

226
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,430
Touching but fucking stupid.

227
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,130
The Sheikh could only ID
one of the killers.

228
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,530
I need you to come up
with the names on the other two.

229
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,030
Start with the one
they killed at Mirbat.

230
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:40,230
So the one target we do have is
Steven Douglas Harris.

231
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,930
He stayed on in Oman after the war.

232
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,630
Ended up flying choppers for
the Sultan's armed forces.

233
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,330
Great. A juice junkie.

234
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,730
Me and Meier will head there
to track him down.

235
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,830
Boys? Danny.

236
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,930
Meier.

237
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,830
What the fuck! Oh piss off!

238
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,730
Piss off!

239
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,730
It's Harris!

240
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,430
Harris, you prick! Fuck off!

241
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,830
Well, I hope the buggers like sand
in their burgers, huh?

242
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:37,730
White Range Rover coming your way.
It's Harris.

243
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,030
What are you doing?

244
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,230
Come on, have a go.

245
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,030
No, I'm not.

246
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,930
Have a go. Look, just aim and shoot.

247
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,730
Go! Here we go!

248
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,530
Oh you horny git!

249
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,630
Come on! Come on!

250
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:32,430
All right, ladies, you can throw
your knickers if you want!

251
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,630
Go on, you cheeky bugger!

252
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,230
You serve in Oman?

253
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,030
That Mirbat. That was a day, wasn't it.

254
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,330
What about Mirbat,
that was a right mess, eh.

255
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,430
Wasn't good.

256
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,330
Had a mate there.

257
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,130
Go on, get that, quick!
Yeah, all right. All right.

258
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:02,530
Bollocks.

259
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,530
Hello?

260
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,630
Spikey, it's Bazza.

261
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,030
For God's sake.

262
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,130
I'm unplugging that bloody thing
next time, and I mean it!

263
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,430
Yeah, I'm on to this bloke here, right.

264
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:16,530
He was in the Bear earlier pumping
some SAS lads for info on Mirbat.

265
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,730
Mirbat? And?

266
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,130
He says he's Welsh
but he don't sound it.

267
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,330
I don't know, maybe
I'm being a bit paranoid, but...

268
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,330
Hey, just because you're being paranoid,

269
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,930
doesn't mean to say
they're not out to get you.

270
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,730
All right mate, give me what you got.

271
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:31,630
Okay.

272
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,530
I'll put one of my Locals on to him.

273
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,130
The Omani Embassy.

274
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:07,330
Our Local followed him
into the visa section.

275
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:11,130
Says he's Welsh.
Calls himself Mr. Jones.

276
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,730
We lost him after he left.

277
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,330
Lost him. How come?

278
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,530
He never came back to his car. Stolen.

279
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,330
Anyhow, he flies to Oman in four days.

280
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,530
I'd like permission to send
one of my boys out there to tail him.

281
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:25,130
This was definitely some kind of recce.

282
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,530
That was a dirty war.
What we did there was questionable.

283
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,530
Oman is a bloody hornet's nest.

284
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,730
Right. And if this bugger is
poking at it,

285
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,030
I want to know who he is.

286
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,930
I say we send a Local. Any objections?

287
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:37,930
Noted.

288
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,330
We'll leave you to choose the right man.

289
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:43,030
I'd also like it noted
that we are ex-SAS.

290
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,030
The men we protect are ex-SAS.

291
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,330
And you, Spike,

292
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:49,430
though you hate to admit it, are ex-SAS.

293
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:52,030
Remember, we're businessmen
and bankers now.

294
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,230
What we do here is illegal.

295
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:57,330
We can leave no trace of our activities.

296
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:00,030
That's why we're called The Feather Men.

297
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:04,030
Because our touch is light.

298
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,530
Our Spike is a good man.

299
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,230
The day the SAS lost him,
they lost a good.

300
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:13,230
Yes, but the problem is,
he thinks he's still in the SAS.

301
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,130
Well, someone has to do the dirty work.

302
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,130
None of us want blood on our pinstripes.

303
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:20,430
Listen, I've got no problem with blood.

304
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:23,030
What worries me is ink.

305
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,830
Make sure he keeps us out of
the newspapers.

306
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:26,530
What's doing boss?

307
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,330
Your Arabic's still good, right?

308
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,030
Good enough.

309
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,330
You're going to Oman. I've got a bloke
I want you to tail out there.

310
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,830
You lucky bastard.

311
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:50,130
You know what, you're gorgeous.

312
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,730
Where you staying?

313
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:54,230
I'm staying at the Hilton.

314
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:57,530
As a matter of fact, so am I.
What room are you in?

315
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:58,930
Why, would you like to know?

316
00:26:59,130 --> 00:26:59,930
Love to know.

317
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,230
You are smooth.

318
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,430
What are we doing out here then,
in the middle of nowhere?

319
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,030
Well, I ask him to go hide it,
he hides it.

320
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,130
Could have been your asshole.

321
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,730
Consider yourself lucky.

322
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,130
Shut it, Meier.

323
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,630
Appreciate it, thank you.

324
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:35,430
These tiles are an exact match to
the shower step?

325
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,230
Hundred percent.

326
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,330
Harris comes home, parks the car.

327
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,930
It's been a hard day.
I'll have a shower.

328
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:44,330
Whoops. He slips on the shampoo.
Hits the corner of the step

329
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,730
with his occiput.

330
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,530
- Case closed.
- Get out of it.

331
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,730
You boys are going about this all wrong.

332
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:53,030
That bird he's screwing is married.

333
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,630
Why don't we just pop Pop'em both and
make it look like her husband did it?

334
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:59,030
Pop'em both. What's she ever done?

335
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,230
It's Harris we're after.

336
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,130
Poor bastard.

337
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:06,730
Ten years after the war he cops it for
doing something he was ordered to do.

338
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,530
He knew what he was doing
when he joined the club.

339
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,630
Yeah. What club?

340
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,230
The killing club.

341
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:12,930
Could've been you or me.

342
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:16,130
Yeah, but it's not.
I'm just glad I never killed a Rag head.

343
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,030
No offence, my son.

344
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,430
Let's get this done.

345
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:22,730
Excuse my friend, he's a royal asshole.

346
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,430
Shit!

347
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:43,430
Where's he going to run?
It's the middle of the fucking desert.

348
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:56,330
Meier!

349
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,230
Cut him off at the next shaft!

350
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,830
Let's go! Let's go!

351
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,330
Where is he?

352
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,830
Ssh.

353
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:47,530
Aagh!

354
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:48,830
Ugh!

355
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,230
Get out of here! Fucking hell!

356
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,030
So what, now somebody's on our ass?

357
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,330
We should move right away.

358
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,430
I'll set up Harris's interview
for tomorrow.

359
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,630
Davies, you make sure his girl
doesn't show.

360
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,430
She has nothing to do with this.

361
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,830
Wanker!

362
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,630
We're military historians.
I'll do the talking, all right.

363
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:42,230
Well, it's five o'clock somewhere,
isn't it?

364
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,830
So where's this documentary going to
be shown then?

365
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,230
On the telly?

366
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,130
The chair.

367
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,630
Those bastards in C Company
put this together hmm?

368
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,730
What's the matter?
They didn't like sand in their burgers.

369
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,530
Eh?

370
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,730
Hello, boys! I'm not saying a word 'til
I see my lawyer.

371
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:34,330
Think back. The village of Qum.

372
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:39,330
You killed a guerrilla commander.
His name was Hussein bin Amr.

373
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,930
Do you admit it?

374
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,930
Fuck off! You're kidding, right?

375
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,130
You commanded a company there.

376
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,930
Aye, I led a company on that op, sure.

377
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,630
Yeah, you assassinated Hussein bin Amr.

378
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:00,530
There were witnesses.

379
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:03,830
You dropped him in front of his family.

380
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:11,430
All right, you got me. I did it!

381
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,230
Fuck you! Good one!

382
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,230
Now untie me!

383
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:15,930
Get up.

384
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,530
Hey! Piss off!

385
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,930
We have what we need.

386
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:26,830
What if I told you somebody else
dropped your guerrilla commander?

387
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,530
His name is?

388
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,630
I can't remember.

389
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,730
But he's writing a book about
the whole Oman gig.

390
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,630
You might find it in there.

391
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,430
If you could read.

392
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,230
To the bathroom.

393
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,930
No, no, no. No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait!

394
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,230
It's coming back to me,
looking at your fucking face!

395
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,530
His name's Captain R. Sole!

396
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:51,430
A, R, S, E, H, O, L, E!

397
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,730
Shut up.

398
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,130
You're fucking dead yeah?

399
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,930
On your knees!

400
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,730
Fucking queers! Serve you fucking right!

401
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,130
Head down. Get your fucking hands off me
you queer!

402
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:05,430
- You're fucking kidding me!
- Hold him still.

403
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,330
If I find you I'm going to

404
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,030
- put your fucking head in the toilet.
- Okay.

405
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:09,830
Poor fucker.

406
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,630
Jay!

407
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:26,230
I need money for the taxi.
I had to take a taxi. I had a flat.

408
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,330
Fuck you! Aagh!

409
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,530
Case closed.

410
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:04,830
Thank you.

411
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:13,530
...tells of a dramatic 12 hour
rescue operation

412
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,930
to save the crew of Radio Caroline.

413
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,530
The pirate radio ship sank the...

414
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,930
Seems your friend did what you couldn't.

415
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,430
Wouldn't.

416
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:30,730
Wouldn't. Couldn't.
He's avenged Hussein.

417
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:33,130
Good news for the old man. Not for you.

418
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,230
What do you mean?

419
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:37,330
Three brothers dead.
Rotting in the sand.

420
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,730
You didn't want to get revenge yourself?

421
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:43,530
Scared of getting your hands dirty?

422
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,730
Better get used to it.

423
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,230
No palace where you're going.

424
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:49,530
A tent and a hole to shit in.

425
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:53,530
He's your worst nightmare
because he's gonna do it.

426
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:57,730
And when he does, you're outta here.

427
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,230
And when I find you in that desert,

428
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,630
I pray God keeps my aim...

429
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,430
true.

430
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:22,930
Well, what do you think?

431
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,730
Yeah, it's coming along.

432
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:31,730
What are you doing for
New Year's Eve dinner?

433
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,130
Oh shit!

434
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,730
Bollocks!

435
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,130
Strangers are a bit of
an exotic thing around here.

436
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,430
Oh, come on.
I didn't think I was a stranger.

437
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:51,730
Well, but you're still exotic.

438
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:55,330
Danny, something tells me
you've got a story to tell.

439
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,530
- Yeah.
- Mm.

440
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:12,230
Come on, what are you waiting for?
Party's outside.

441
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,730
Happy New Year!

442
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,230
It's a tradition around here.

443
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,230
Happy New Year.

444
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,830
Shit!

445
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:13,630
Mirbat. The artist's name is
on the back.

446
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,430
Have them talk to him.

447
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:20,830
One more thing.
My boys had some trouble in Oman.

448
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,430
Somebody was tailing them.

449
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:24,930
We'll have to have a look into that,
won't we?

450
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,530
Yeah.

451
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,430
Ah, that's how you get it
so life-like then.

452
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,330
Sorry?

453
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:43,430
Photos of the lads.
Isn't that like cheating?

454
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:46,530
I'm recreating a historical event.
Accuracy's everything.

455
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:50,430
Mm, that Mirbat painting stopped me cold
when I saw it.

456
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,530
You were at Mirbat?

457
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:55,530
Had a mate there. I was hoping you
might have an address for him.

458
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:56,630
You with the SAS?

459
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:57,930
Was.

460
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:01,430
Your best bet for an address would be
Regimental Association...

461
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,930
They won't talk to me.
I spent the last few years

462
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:07,330
plying my trade overseas.
Angola and that.

463
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:09,630
I come to you unofficial like.

464
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,030
Ah.

465
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:16,330
Well, I might have something somewhere.

466
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:17,930
Just give me a few minutes.

467
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,130
Be my guest.

468
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,430
I've got a bullshitter
asking about Mirbat.

469
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,530
Yeah, claims he's with the Regiment.

470
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:42,530
No, there's no way he was SAS.
Yeah, I can smell it off him.

471
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:45,130
Nah, he's a bloody fake!

472
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:51,530
Argh! Argh! Argh!

473
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,630
My contact says the call was cut off,
but Gowling said that

474
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:15,430
there was somebody there asking
about Mirbat. It has to be our guy.

475
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:17,530
And what would you have us do about it?

476
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:20,330
Find him. If we don't,
there's going to be another murder

477
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,830
and it'll be one of our Mirbat boys.

478
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,330
Then who are they?

479
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,230
Well, they're pros for sure.

480
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,830
If these guys are going after the SAS,

481
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:29,230
they're going to be
top class professional assassins.

482
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:31,430
They must have a string of hits
behind them,

483
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,930
but they're completely under the radar.

484
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,530
All we've got is Oman.

485
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:36,330
Oman?

486
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:38,230
We all know our people went too far.

487
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:41,030
Oman. Mirbat.
It all needs to be left alone.

488
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:43,730
You should try telling
that to the Welshman.

489
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:45,930
He's right.

490
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:49,430
We have to find this phoney Welshman
and his crew.

491
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:55,130
The file says an SAS officer killed
the Sheikh's son at Battle of Mirbat.

492
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:58,630
Warwick Steven Cregg. He was
the only officer there that night.

493
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,630
Killed everything that moved.

494
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,830
He's our worst nightmare.
A real hotshot.

495
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,130
Paintings of him. The lot.

496
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,430
Where'd you get this?

497
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,930
The bloke who did the paintings.

498
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:12,030
Don't you worry about that all right?
He's shuffled off this mortal coil.

499
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,230
That wasn't part of the deal.

500
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:16,330
Come on. Shit happens when you play
in the deep end of the pool, Danny.

501
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,730
Why can't you two stick to the plan,
huh?

502
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:23,730
Well you've been watching this Cregg.
What's your next big idea?

503
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,330
His wife's in hospital.

504
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:28,630
When he's not training for the selection
march he spends most days there.

505
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:30,330
So why don't we hit him there?

506
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:30,930
No.

507
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,430
Not near his family.

508
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,230
Get me everything
you know on that march.

509
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,330
We'll see where that goes.

510
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:52,730
Okay, so there's only four Mirbat
survivors in Britain.

511
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:54,830
I've got Locals on the other three.

512
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:56,430
You get the celebrity.

513
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:59,630
Warwick Cregg? You're kidding.

514
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,330
Wish I was.

515
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,830
Welcome to hell
the SAS selection march.

516
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:09,730
Forty-one miles,
fifty-five pounds of gear.

517
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:12,330
They lose someone every couple of years.

518
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,830
Don't you even think about it.

519
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,030
Why not?

520
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:19,830
During the march this place is
crawling with SAS.

521
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:23,230
Yeah, you said it yourself
it's an accident waiting to happen.

522
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,030
How are you going to catch him then?

523
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:27,530
He's been training for months.
He's like a greyhound.

524
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:30,130
Just have to slow him down, won't we?

525
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:37,530
Insulin, Chlorpropamide. Initial here.

526
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,230
Anything doing?

527
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:50,230
Nah. Cregg's still in there with
his missus.

528
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:54,130
Here boss, this'll keep you going.

529
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,830
Cheers.

530
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:20,930
Pennock!

531
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:23,230
I need you back here, mate. Pronto!

532
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:43,730
Oh! What are you doing?

533
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,630
What are you doing? You're fucking mad.

534
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:28,930
Fuck! Get out of the fucking way!

535
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:36,430
He's a maniac!

536
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:44,430
- Watch out!
- Oh! Unbelievable.

537
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:15,730
Argh!

538
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:19,930
Aagh!

539
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,930
Ugh!

540
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,330
Aaagh!

541
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:35,830
Ugh!

542
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:49,230
Ugh!

543
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:45,330
You wouldn't fucking believe it.
Somebody was watching Cregg.

544
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:45,930
What?

545
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:47,030
Mmm.

546
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:49,330
You think he's from the same stable
as the shooter in the desert?

547
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:52,830
Maybe. He was good.
But whoever he is, he's too late.

548
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:57,130
Ah good, good. Chroma slows him down,

549
00:46:57,330 --> 00:47:01,730
insulin sends him into shock.

550
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:03,630
Hypothermia to you.

551
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:05,130
And when were you planning on
getting it to him?

552
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:06,730
Before the march.

553
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:09,830
How? It's an SAS base, Danny.

554
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:11,930
That you trained in.

555
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:15,530
So think back, the security layout,
the lot.

556
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:19,030
You're nuts.

557
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:20,630
Are you going to do it?

558
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:24,430
Man, you really are
onecrazy sonofabitch, Danny.

559
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:42,830
Clock's ticking.
You've got under a minute, all right?

560
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:57,730
We got company.

561
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:06,330
Lovely night.

562
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:07,830
You can't stop here, mate.

563
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:09,030
I didn't stop. The truck did!

564
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:10,530
If you don't fucking move it, we will!

565
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:12,130
All right, all right.
But it's pissing oil, mate.

566
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:13,230
There's nothing I could do about it.

567
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:15,130
Turn off the bloody radio.

568
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:33,430
Where's your gear?

569
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:18,930
Right! On the trucks!

570
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:21,430
I don't care what regiment you're from.

571
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:23,530
I don't care
how great you think you are.

572
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:25,430
Let's see what you're made of, ladies.

573
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:26,630
On the trucks.

574
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,030
Come on.

575
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:30,130
Get moving you lot.

576
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:58,330
He only got half the dose!

577
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,230
Is it enough?

578
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,430
Enough? He's a dead man walking!
Stay on him, okay?

579
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:25,630
His name was Salim Bin Amr.

580
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:27,130
Do you remember the name?
Did you kill him?

581
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:28,230
Think back. Did you kill him, Major?

582
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:29,830
Yeah, I did it. I did the bastard.

583
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:34,230
So bloody what?

584
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:37,830
Danny didn't want to do this.

585
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:43,130
And your boy doesn't want to go back
to the desert.

586
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:59,730
The Ministry of Defence today
announced the death of an army officer

587
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:03,930
during manoeuvres. The 33 year old,
Major Warwick Steven Cregg,

588
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:08,130
died of exposure during an SAS exercise
on the Brecon Beacons.

589
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:12,130
Weather conditions at the time were
described as appalling...

590
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:31,830
Show a bit of respect lads.

591
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:44,230
Top that.

592
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:46,730
I come bearing gifts.

593
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:51,030
Oi!

594
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:55,130
From my boys in Angola.

595
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:58,830
I have no idea
how you're meant to eat this.

596
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:00,430
So.

597
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:02,030
So.

598
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:03,130
Who's on our arse?

599
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:05,030
I'm on it. Don't worry.

600
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:06,930
Look, there's only one more to go.

601
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:10,130
After this is done I'll get
you boys a nice cushy job in the sun.

602
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:12,430
Hm?

603
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:14,530
There is no "after this. "

604
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:21,330
I'm a vulture. I live off killers.

605
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,630
Gives me a unique perspective.

606
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:25,930
Have you heard of the "two percent"?
That's you,

607
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:28,130
Davies, the SAS. All you lot.

608
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:30,130
Mercenaries, hit-men, heroes.

609
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:33,930
You're all part of that two percent
of men who are natural killers.

610
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:36,330
That's why you'll never get out.

611
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:39,130
You can't run away from
who you are, Danny.

612
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:44,630
That's not who I am.
That's what I've done.

613
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:46,930
And I can do something else.

614
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:47,930
Yeah, yeah.

615
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:49,530
That's all nice and good,

616
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:52,330
but let's just take care of
business first, shall we.

617
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:56,930
Your third target, Major Simon.

618
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:58,830
Mad Simon of late.

619
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:00,130
How'd you find him?

620
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:02,830
Asked around. It was easy.

621
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:06,630
These days he's your basic cash for
trash mercenary.

622
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:09,230
He's a sitting duck.

623
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:13,030
Now didn't I tell you
I came bearing gifts.

624
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:15,730
You know where to find me.

625
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:21,030
You don't trust that snake, do you?
He's lying.

626
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:22,730
Yeah? How do you know?

627
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:24,230
His lips were moving.

628
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:26,130
He just gave us a third target.

629
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:28,030
You've done nothing on that last file.

630
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:29,330
Someone's onto us!

631
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:32,130
I want Hunter out of there.
I want this finished!

632
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:34,330
And I want to be around to enjoy
the money when it is.

633
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:37,630
Well the first thing you should buy is
a pair of balls.

634
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:40,130
We're going after. All right?

635
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:48,330
I miss you.

636
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:52,130
There's a lot I don't know about you,
but I do know that much.

637
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:54,730
I convince myself that everything's okay

638
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:57,730
because when I'm with you, I'm happy.

639
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:02,730
But then you go away and I realize
that I know nothing about you.

640
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:04,930
I don't know where you go and
I don't know what you do.

641
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:06,530
I mean,

642
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:08,930
you've got a whole other life Danny.

643
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:12,330
Is there someone else?

644
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:13,430
Come on Anne.

645
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:15,230
Well then what is it?

646
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:17,330
I mean, Jesus,
what are you not telling me?

647
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:18,930
What are you hiding?

648
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:21,130
Can we talk about this when I get back?

649
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:23,530
To hell with it.

650
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:28,730
Fuck!

651
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:41,330
What?

652
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:43,830
You show me a beautiful woman

653
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:46,230
and I'll show you a bloke
that's sick of her shit.

654
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:47,530
Shut up.

655
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:49,030
Roger that.

656
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,130
- That him?
- That's him.

657
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:56,030
Major Simon.

658
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:59,930
Served in the Sultan's forces 'til
he was pensioned out four years ago.

659
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:02,130
And another!

660
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:03,830
Oi!

661
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:05,230
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

662
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:06,730
Piss off, Grandpa.

663
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:07,830
You want some?

664
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:10,330
Oh!

665
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:13,130
Doesn't look like an invalid.

666
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:16,730
Like I said, a bomb went off
under his jeep.

667
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:18,530
Scrambled his wiring.

668
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:22,230
He can't keep a job.
He's a fucking psycho.

669
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:26,030
Jesus.

670
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:30,330
Come on, mate. That's enough.

671
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:33,330
What's he doing here?

672
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:37,530
That's the one I went head to head
with at the hospital.

673
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,030
Right.

674
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:45,030
Wait, wait, wait.

675
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:52,730
Let's go.

676
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:54,930
Stick with him.

677
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:35,630
Mac, it's me. You okay?

678
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:39,330
Oh, yeah. Still scraping skinheads off
my doorstep.

679
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:42,630
All right, mate. I was just checking in.

680
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:53,630
Bloke who drives that green Jag.
What's his name?

681
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:59,330
His name's Spike Logan.
He's an ex- of some kind.

682
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:02,730
He got his eye shot out
playing a hero somewhere.

683
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:06,430
He's got no job and he keeps odd hours.

684
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:07,930
Hmmm.

685
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:10,630
Don't you know who these guys are?

686
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:12,830
I mean, secrets being your bread
and butter.

687
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,130
Don't worry about it.

688
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:17,030
I do worry about it. You should, too.

689
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:20,030
Every move my guys make,
these lot are waiting.

690
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:21,330
If you ask me,

691
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:25,230
I think it's time you put those fancy
shoes of yours on a few throats.

692
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:28,130
Yes. But no one is asking you.

693
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:36,830
You'll be interviewing for
a security position, Mr. McCann.

694
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:37,330
Right.

695
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:40,230
Actually we got your name through
a mutual friend in the SAS.

696
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:41,630
Yeah, really?

697
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:43,930
So we'll see you Tuesday
the 17th at ten?

698
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:44,830
Okay.

699
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:46,030
We look forward to it.

700
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:46,930
See you then.

701
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,830
All right, my son.

702
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:50,930
He'll be there.

703
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:51,730
Good.

704
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:53,030
I don't get it.

705
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,230
McCann lives here.

706
00:57:57,430 --> 00:58:00,630
He'll be here for the interview,
Tuesday at ten.

707
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:03,430
He'll take this road.

708
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:05,830
The Boston Brakes! Perfect!

709
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:07,330
They weren't perfect in Boston.

710
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:08,730
I wasn't at the controls!

711
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:09,830
Got ten days.

712
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:11,030
Ten days?

713
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:12,530
Quicker we get this done, the better.

714
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:14,730
I'm going to need to bring in some help.

715
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:15,330
Okay.

716
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:18,730
- Okay? Just like that?
- McCann's being watched.

717
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:20,430
How you going to
get a confession out of him?

718
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:23,630
We aren't. We'll fake it.

719
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:27,130
Bit of bad lighting and camera work.
You can be him.

720
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:30,430
What we'll do is play
what he admitted to in the reports.

721
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:48,230
Who are you?

722
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:50,530
I'm the one they let fly around
in an unmarked chopper

723
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:51,930
with a gun in my pocket.

724
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:53,630
You can call me Mfwic.

725
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:54,730
Mfwic?

726
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:57,630
Mother Fucker What's In Charge.

727
00:58:58,030 --> 00:58:59,730
We have questions.

728
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:04,130
About this little illegal club of yours.
The Feather Men.

729
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:07,730
Your attack dog,
time to bring him to heel, eh?

730
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:13,230
And then we'll put that on the agenda.

731
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:14,530
Gentlemen.

732
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:16,530
We'll be with you in a minute.

733
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:25,730
I want to put Locals on
Major McCann. Around the clock.

734
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:28,930
I realise McCann is
an old friend of yours.

735
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:30,730
But what has he to do with us?

736
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:36,530
But this is our chance to get the
bastards who killed Cregg and Harris!

737
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:39,530
The authorities found no evidence of
foul play in either case.

738
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:42,830
What are you talking about, no evidence?
I've got the evidence right here!

739
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:49,930
Everybody in this room knows that
those men were killed.

740
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:53,930
Everybody knows that
McCann is going to be next!

741
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:54,930
That's enough. Spike.

742
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:56,230
We have to do something!

743
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:57,530
Well, we could put it to the vote.

744
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:59,830
Yes, but that would require
the full committee,

745
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:03,130
and... it'll have to wait.

746
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:19,330
Spike!

747
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:23,530
That was a set up! He sent him away!
He knew there'd be a vote!

748
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:24,730
Spike, please!

749
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:25,830
Look, listen.

750
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:28,130
This is getting big.

751
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:31,730
The powers that be are asking questions.
Pressure is being applied.

752
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:33,430
They have their reputations to protect.

753
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,030
I'm not doing this to
protect reputations.

754
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:38,330
You know, a 'light touch' is one thing.

755
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:40,930
But no touch at all? I can't do this.

756
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:44,230
You realise this thing is set up
for maximum deniability.

757
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:45,430
You're the only one who knows

758
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:47,530
the Locals.
All their orders come through you.

759
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:49,430
- So?
- So?

760
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:53,230
This comes out, you're the one
who takes the fall.

761
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:55,730
Fall? From where?

762
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:59,430
I am done with this whole
committee thing.

763
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:01,630
I'm going to find him.

764
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:07,430
He's a good kid, don't worry.
I'm schtupping his mum.

765
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:09,230
Does he know he can't bring his mum
on the job?

766
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:11,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

767
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:32,130
Tell your mates in Oman I said hello.

768
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:35,630
Danny, is this what it was like
when you were first starting?

769
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:38,730
This is your first job? Jesus.

770
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:42,930
My first time I puked for
a day afterwards.

771
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:45,830
I was young and dumb.
Just the way the army likes 'em.

772
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:47,930
I can be good at this man.

773
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:50,030
I mean, it's easy, yeah?

774
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:52,030
Killing's easy.

775
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:56,530
Living with it's the hard part.

776
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:02,430
If I see him, I'll give you a bell.

777
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:05,330
Don't be shy about spreading the

778
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,830
word. There's a very tidy finder's fee.

779
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:09,630
I'll keep my eyes peeled.

780
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:12,030
One more and we'll call it a night.

781
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:17,630
We're on.

782
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:21,330
He's late.

783
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:27,230
Just keep me at 75 feet
and give me a clear line of sight.

784
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:28,830
Yeah, okay.

785
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:18,130
Where'd you buy your licence!

786
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:24,130
On his tail. Doing sixty.

787
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:32,530
You'll have a visual on Danny
in one minute.

788
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:38,430
Stay with him, Jake.

789
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:40,230
I got him, I got him.

790
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:43,630
We have target in sight.

791
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:44,530
I'm going to miss it.

792
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:47,530
Come on, get in! Get in behind him!
Just do it, get in!

793
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:48,630
There's not enough room!

794
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:49,330
Push him!

795
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:50,530
I can't get in there!

796
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:53,130
Okay then, overtake him! Go! Pass him!

797
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:56,130
What the hell you doing Meier?

798
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:57,530
I need a range countdown.

799
01:03:57,630 --> 01:03:58,830
Meier, don't screw this up.

800
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:00,530
I'll operate looking backwards.

801
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:01,630
Relax, Meier.

802
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:03,630
Davies will give you the countdown.

803
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:09,130
Four hundred meters.

804
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:14,930
Okay, range me.

805
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:20,330
Three hundred meters.

806
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:23,730
Lane Meier.

807
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:28,430
Two hundred meters.

808
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:33,630
Here he comes.

809
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:36,530
One hundred meters.

810
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:47,330
Now! Now, now, now!

811
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:48,830
Shut up!

812
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:51,830
Fishtail! Fishtail!

813
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:53,830
Argh!

814
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:02,330
Oh! Oh!

815
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:05,030
You fucking got him.
You got him man!

816
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:07,730
Oh fuck, he's dead. He's dead as Elvis.

817
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:18,030
You got him, man!

818
01:05:18,530 --> 01:05:19,930
Stop the car!

819
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:22,730
We gotta be sure Elvis has left
the building!

820
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:35,630
Target had a minder!
Head to the exit point!

821
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:40,430
Bring him to me!

822
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:43,230
He had a fucking minder!

823
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:44,030
Fuck, you got him, man!

824
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:45,730
- You got him!
- Just shut up! Drive!

825
01:05:45,930 --> 01:05:47,030
Go, go, go!

826
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:47,730
Who is he?

827
01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:49,930
I don't know. Give me an update, Davies.

828
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:53,630
Oh, man, he's coming fast!

829
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:57,230
Up here there's a yard.
Take a left. Shit.

830
01:05:57,430 --> 01:05:58,730
Up here to the left. Keep going!

831
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:00,330
Hold on.

832
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:03,430
Come in, Davies!

833
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:10,430
Davies, where the fuck are you?

834
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:12,830
Got you, you bastards!

835
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:17,030
Fuck this! Go, go!

836
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:21,330
Here he comes. Here he comes!

837
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:27,330
Get out of the car!

838
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:30,030
Where the fuck do you guys come from?

839
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:32,130
- Step away from the car.
- Easy.

840
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:33,630
Take it easy.

841
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:36,230
Check the car! Slowly!

842
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:38,330
No no no!

843
01:06:48,730 --> 01:06:49,930
Argh! No!

844
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:10,830
No ID. Nothing. Not a fucking thing.

845
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:13,430
Who the fuck is he?

846
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:15,830
It shouldn't have happened.

847
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:21,530
It should not have fucking happened!

848
01:07:21,630 --> 01:07:22,430
Take it easy Danny.

849
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:23,030
Danny.

850
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:24,630
Take it easy?

851
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:28,230
We were out of there, clean! Done!

852
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:50,630
Look, I'm getting nothing.
Campbell's not picking.

853
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:52,830
- Is there anything at your end?
- Fuck!

854
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:53,430
No, still no sign.

855
01:07:53,630 --> 01:07:55,830
- Who are these bastards?
- We've got a burnt Volvo here.

856
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:57,830
I don't know
but they're looking for their man.

857
01:07:57,930 --> 01:08:01,630
And they're not legit.
Jake, call this number.

858
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:05,730
Tell the Agent we need a clean up
crew here ASAP.

859
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:08,230
And wire that radio into my car.

860
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:10,030
Gimme here!

861
01:08:13,830 --> 01:08:14,430
So that's it then.

862
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:15,730
Yeah. Done.

863
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:21,430
I'll fly out tonight.
You should get going, too.

864
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:22,730
They're close.

865
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:24,330
What happens to Meier's cut?

866
01:08:25,030 --> 01:08:26,630
There has to be somebody.

867
01:08:26,830 --> 01:08:30,130
Poor sod. I'll have a hooker for him.
He'd like that.

868
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:32,530
Yeah.

869
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:34,430
Be safe.

870
01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:36,530
You too, Davies.

871
01:08:43,930 --> 01:08:47,630
I'm sorry. I'm still looking for,
but it looks bad.

872
01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:21,030
Thank you sir. If there's anything else

873
01:09:21,130 --> 01:09:24,630
Room service. Something exotic.

874
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:47,130
Yeah?

875
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:48,930
I found your Welshman.

876
01:09:50,130 --> 01:09:51,330
You sure it's him?

877
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:52,930
I'm sure.

878
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:26,030
- Hell!
- Fucking

879
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:29,230
Get up. Get dressed.

880
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:32,230
Move! Move! Get up!

881
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:35,330
Don't say a word to anyone.
Do you understand?

882
01:10:36,730 --> 01:10:39,030
You killed Simon, didn't you?

883
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:42,430
Yeah, and Campbell! Where is he,
you fucker?

884
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:43,930
Never heard of him!

885
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:48,630
That all you got?

886
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:53,230
Yeah Spike.

887
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:54,730
We got the Welshman.

888
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:56,630
We're bringing him to you now. Over.

889
01:10:57,430 --> 01:11:00,030
Nice work Pennock. Well done.

890
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:02,630
I'm looking forward to meeting
the bastard.

891
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:04,130
Urrgh!

892
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:09,630
Hey, Spike's going to cut your dick off
and shove it in your mouth.

893
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:10,330
You like that?

894
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:11,030
I like the sound of that, yeah.

895
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:12,330
- Do you? Yeah.
- Yeah I do.

896
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:13,730
Get in the van. Get in.

897
01:11:13,930 --> 01:11:15,830
Come on. Get in.

898
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:26,430
Fuck me, you're kidding.
Come on, get in!

899
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:35,130
There you are, you prick!

900
01:11:45,230 --> 01:11:45,830
Oi!

901
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:50,930
Get out of the road you fucking idiot!

902
01:11:51,130 --> 01:11:51,530
- Open up!
- Piss off!

903
01:11:51,630 --> 01:11:52,930
Oi! Oi wait!

904
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:08,430
Boss?

905
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:16,430
What am I meant to do with that?

906
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:18,230
He had this on him.

907
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:20,930
Oh, a phone number. Great work.

908
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:24,630
That pile of mince meat was
our best chance of finding out

909
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:26,430
who these bastards are!

910
01:12:27,230 --> 01:12:30,830
Print him. And trace that bloody number.

911
01:12:32,830 --> 01:12:34,930
You fucking idiots!

912
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:52,530
Drop it.

913
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:56,630
Left hand. The gun. On the floor.

914
01:13:05,230 --> 01:13:06,630
Kick it to me.

915
01:13:10,030 --> 01:13:11,730
The Welshman.
They were bringing him to you.

916
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:13,130
Where is he?

917
01:13:13,230 --> 01:13:14,930
He didn't make it.

918
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:17,430
You. You do it?

919
01:13:17,530 --> 01:13:20,330
A truck. He made a break for it.

920
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:21,530
He got lucky.

921
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:23,430
It would've been very slow otherwise.

922
01:13:23,630 --> 01:13:25,230
Yeah, well that was my fucking friend!

923
01:13:25,330 --> 01:13:27,030
Yeah? And McCann was mine.
And what about fucking

924
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:28,430
Cregg

925
01:13:29,230 --> 01:13:30,630
No.

926
01:13:30,730 --> 01:13:34,330
Davies. Meier. Harris.

927
01:13:34,430 --> 01:13:40,130
McCann. Cregg. Campbell.
Too many names on that list.

928
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:42,630
Don't go adding yours. Spike.

929
01:13:42,730 --> 01:13:44,530
Inside.

930
01:13:47,530 --> 01:13:48,430
Who are you?

931
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:50,430
Doesn't matter.

932
01:13:51,230 --> 01:13:53,030
After tonight I don't exist.

933
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:54,630
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

934
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:56,630
It's over. Done.

935
01:13:56,830 --> 01:13:58,130
You think so?

936
01:14:00,530 --> 01:14:03,430
No uniform. No war. Not special.

937
01:14:04,330 --> 01:14:06,130
You don't know what to do with yourself.

938
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:09,230
Nobody knows what to do with you. Right?

939
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:10,330
Wrong.

940
01:14:10,430 --> 01:14:12,830
You know my name, but you don't know me.

941
01:14:12,930 --> 01:14:15,230
You have no idea
who you're fucking with.

942
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:16,630
Really?

943
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:20,430
Don't follow me.

944
01:14:21,530 --> 01:14:23,930
Don't put your name on that list.

945
01:14:34,430 --> 01:14:36,630
The third confession.

946
01:14:42,830 --> 01:14:45,130
The killers have been killed.

947
01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:48,230
Now you can go home.

948
01:14:49,230 --> 01:14:51,330
You can have your man.

949
01:14:52,230 --> 01:14:54,430
You will get the money
when it's been checked.

950
01:14:55,230 --> 01:14:56,730
Bring him out.

951
01:14:58,830 --> 01:15:00,430
Bring him out!

952
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:05,830
Let me put...
I just want to put my watch on.

953
01:15:05,930 --> 01:15:07,330
What's the matter with you?

954
01:15:07,530 --> 01:15:08,730
- You right?
- Yeah.

955
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:10,130
What's the plan?

956
01:15:10,330 --> 01:15:11,730
We get out of here.

957
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:14,130
Okay. Sounds good.

958
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:20,630
I was sure you were going to
get yourself killed, Kiddo.

959
01:15:20,730 --> 01:15:23,130
How the hell did you do it?
How'd you pull it off?

960
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:24,330
I don't want to talk about it.

961
01:15:24,430 --> 01:15:25,930
I get it. But thank you.

962
01:15:26,030 --> 01:15:27,230
Not for me but for my kids.

963
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:29,030
For them having a dad.

964
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:30,730
I can never thank you enough for
what you did. Never.

965
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:33,330
Yeah you can.
You can get out of the business.

966
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:34,630
Be done with this shit.

967
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:36,830
No more ing. No more mercenary work.
All right.

968
01:15:37,030 --> 01:15:38,730
Okay, okay.

969
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:43,130
I'm asking you, please.
Tell me you're done.

970
01:15:44,330 --> 01:15:45,530
I'm done. I'm out.

971
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:47,930
Good. Well stay out.

972
01:15:48,130 --> 01:15:49,730
Otherwise all this is for nothing.

973
01:15:50,330 --> 01:15:52,030
So how are the Yankees doing?

974
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:20,230
You could've called.

975
01:16:21,530 --> 01:16:22,930
You wouldn't have answered.

976
01:16:23,930 --> 01:16:26,430
No. Sorry about that.

977
01:16:27,230 --> 01:16:30,530
You're sorry?
It's me who should be sorry.

978
01:16:34,530 --> 01:16:37,930
So it's over? You going back again?

979
01:16:38,730 --> 01:16:40,130
No.

980
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:45,630
And you're ready to tell me everything?

981
01:16:46,830 --> 01:16:48,530
Whatever you want to know.

982
01:16:51,830 --> 01:16:53,030
Good.

983
01:16:55,130 --> 01:16:59,030
Except I don't want to know.
Not anymore.

984
01:17:04,030 --> 01:17:05,930
I've... I've missed you, Danny.

985
01:17:07,630 --> 01:17:10,830
I don't really care about the past.
I just care about now.

986
01:17:31,330 --> 01:17:32,130
Hey boss.

987
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:32,930
All right Cal?

988
01:17:33,130 --> 01:17:34,030
That phone number.

989
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:35,430
That was a business.

990
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:37,530
It's for some shit travel agent.

991
01:17:37,630 --> 01:17:41,330
Runs mercenaries in and out of
every shit-hole in the world.

992
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:43,130
Come in.

993
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:05,430
Hello?

994
01:18:06,030 --> 01:18:07,830
Hello, Danny.

995
01:18:10,430 --> 01:18:11,930
Where'd you get this number?

996
01:18:12,130 --> 01:18:16,030
Please Danny
don't insult my professionalism.

997
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:18,430
What do you want?

998
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:20,730
We got a problem with the job.

999
01:18:24,030 --> 01:18:24,830
The job's done.

1000
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:27,130
No. You killed the wrong guy.

1001
01:18:27,330 --> 01:18:28,330
There's one more to go.

1002
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:30,230
I busted my nuts setting this job up

1003
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:31,330
and I want my ten percent.

1004
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:34,530
No. I did what I had to do.

1005
01:18:34,730 --> 01:18:38,530
Tell that to the Sheikh.
He wants a London meet with his son.

1006
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:42,530
Check with your girlfriend before
you make any rash decisions, eh?

1007
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:55,230
What are you doing? Come to bed.

1008
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:02,830
Come with me, Anne.

1009
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:04,130
What?

1010
01:20:04,330 --> 01:20:05,630
To Paris.

1011
01:20:06,230 --> 01:20:08,230
You can wait for me there
while I'm in London.

1012
01:20:08,330 --> 01:20:10,230
Leave tomorrow.
Nothing's keeping you here, right?

1013
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:13,130
I... it's the middle of the night.
You can't do this...

1014
01:20:13,230 --> 01:20:15,630
Anne. Anne! They know about you.

1015
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:17,730
Who knows about me?

1016
01:20:19,330 --> 01:20:21,230
And about us.

1017
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:56,530
When will this be over?

1018
01:20:56,730 --> 01:20:58,130
Soon.

1019
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:02,430
If all goes well.

1020
01:21:03,230 --> 01:21:04,630
It will, won't it?

1021
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:34,130
Danny.

1022
01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:35,930
Keep a good eye on her, huh?

1023
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:38,130
Listen, don't do this on your own.

1024
01:21:38,230 --> 01:21:39,230
No other way.

1025
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:40,830
Davies? Meier? All this heat on you?

1026
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:42,930
C'mon. Let's just get in the car
and go to London.

1027
01:21:43,130 --> 01:21:44,330
Hit the airport and that's it

1028
01:21:44,430 --> 01:21:46,130
No. We have a deal remember?

1029
01:21:46,230 --> 01:21:48,530
What, do you think I can't cut this?
Is that it?

1030
01:21:48,630 --> 01:21:50,030
I mean I'm not a babysitter. Come on.

1031
01:21:50,230 --> 01:21:52,830
I need to know she's safe.
You're the only one I trust.

1032
01:21:52,930 --> 01:21:55,630
This is bullshit. You could run.
Both of you. Just go. Come on.

1033
01:21:55,730 --> 01:21:58,030
Everyone gets found. You know that.

1034
01:21:58,530 --> 01:22:00,530
You're gonna get yourself killed kiddo.

1035
01:22:06,730 --> 01:22:08,230
Thanks for doing this.

1036
01:22:09,130 --> 01:22:10,630
You got to be kidding me.

1037
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:25,430
- Welcome back to London, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

1038
01:23:05,030 --> 01:23:06,230
You tell the old man
he threatens her again,

1039
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:07,830
I'll put it between his eyes.

1040
01:23:07,930 --> 01:23:09,930
Harris. The pilot.

1041
01:23:10,030 --> 01:23:12,630
On his film
he said another killed my brother.

1042
01:23:12,830 --> 01:23:15,930
He was winding us up.
He thought it was some kind of a joke.

1043
01:23:16,130 --> 01:23:18,030
This was just published.

1044
01:23:19,230 --> 01:23:21,530
The author served with the SAS.

1045
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:24,930
He describes an ambush where
he killed a guerrilla leader.

1046
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:28,730
Harris did not kill Hussein.

1047
01:23:32,630 --> 01:23:36,630
You gave me his name.
You said he was guilty.

1048
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:39,830
Well, such is Allah's will.

1049
01:23:40,930 --> 01:23:42,630
Allah's will!

1050
01:23:42,730 --> 01:23:45,130
You had me kill an innocent man.

1051
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:49,330
The book will be
the real killer's confession.

1052
01:23:50,330 --> 01:23:52,030
Now my father needs

1053
01:23:52,430 --> 01:23:54,930
I know what your father needs!

1054
01:24:07,030 --> 01:24:09,430
I need everything
you can get on a Ranulph Fiennes.

1055
01:24:09,530 --> 01:24:12,030
Yeah, writer. Ex-SAS.

1056
01:24:22,530 --> 01:24:24,730
LGM Travel. How can I help you?

1057
01:24:26,630 --> 01:24:27,530
What you got?

1058
01:24:28,130 --> 01:24:29,630
I got Fiennes.

1059
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:32,330
He's still pushing his book on Oman.

1060
01:24:32,430 --> 01:24:35,430
He'll be doing a press bash on Tuesday.

1061
01:24:37,130 --> 01:24:37,830
Tuesday?

1062
01:24:38,030 --> 01:24:40,630
I know it's a bit short notice but
I'll be able to pull a crew together.

1063
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:43,930
No. I'll do this on my own.

1064
01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:47,530
Danny, are you sure?
It's just a phone call.

1065
01:24:48,930 --> 01:24:50,930
I guess he's sure.

1066
01:24:55,230 --> 01:24:58,530
B - I - N - G fucking O.

1067
01:24:59,530 --> 01:25:02,330
I knew I'd find you, you bastard.

1068
01:25:19,330 --> 01:25:20,830
Do you mind if I sit down?

1069
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:22,730
You looked lonely.

1070
01:25:22,830 --> 01:25:24,230
You're Danny's friend.

1071
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:27,130
The famous Hunter.

1072
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:28,630
He say nice things?

1073
01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:30,230
What are you doing here?

1074
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:32,430
Watching you.

1075
01:25:32,530 --> 01:25:33,630
You should be with him.

1076
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:36,330
I tried. Didn't work.

1077
01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:38,130
He wanted me here to protect you.

1078
01:25:38,330 --> 01:25:39,930
And you looked like
you needed protecting.

1079
01:25:40,430 --> 01:25:41,530
From what?

1080
01:25:41,930 --> 01:25:43,530
You.

1081
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:48,430
You're thinking about him
not coming back. What happens then.

1082
01:25:49,530 --> 01:25:49,930
No. I...

1083
01:25:50,030 --> 01:25:52,430
I have a wife. I know the look.

1084
01:25:53,430 --> 01:25:56,330
We've known each other through thick
and thin,

1085
01:25:57,330 --> 01:26:01,030
Danny and I. Celine, my wife,
she loves him. My kids love him.

1086
01:26:01,130 --> 01:26:03,230
I mean, wild animals like Danny. Yeah.

1087
01:26:06,330 --> 01:26:08,730
I know Danny's going to
come back for you.

1088
01:26:09,930 --> 01:26:12,430
And when he does
you're gonna steal him away, huh?

1089
01:26:13,530 --> 01:26:15,230
I don't know what the plan is.

1090
01:26:17,530 --> 01:26:18,630
Monsieur?

1091
01:26:19,730 --> 01:26:20,430
Oui Monsieur?

1092
01:26:21,130 --> 01:26:23,330
- Bottle de vin rouge s'il vous plait?
- Tout de suite.

1093
01:26:23,530 --> 01:26:26,030
I have a woman to interrogate now.

1094
01:26:31,830 --> 01:26:33,330
All right, look alive lads.

1095
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:34,430
Boys.

1096
01:26:35,530 --> 01:26:37,330
So this guy is good, very good.

1097
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:39,230
He senses something's up, he runs,

1098
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:40,930
you corner him, he fights.

1099
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:42,830
But now the gloves are off.

1100
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:44,530
This all fucking ends today.

1101
01:26:44,630 --> 01:26:46,130
All right, everybody knows the rules.

1102
01:26:46,330 --> 01:26:47,830
There are no rules.

1103
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:23,630
Boss, he's out front. I think we're on.

1104
01:27:32,130 --> 01:27:34,030
This could be him. Black leathers.

1105
01:27:34,330 --> 01:27:35,430
Roger that.

1106
01:27:49,930 --> 01:27:51,530
He just took the service stairs.
It has to be him.

1107
01:27:51,730 --> 01:27:54,630
Just hold your positions.
We'll know soon enough.

1108
01:28:23,830 --> 01:28:24,630
He's down, boss! We got him!

1109
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:27,530
He stays alive Pennock!
Don't you touch him 'til I'm there!

1110
01:28:28,530 --> 01:28:29,330
You stay here!

1111
01:28:35,430 --> 01:28:36,830
Stay there you fucker!

1112
01:28:38,830 --> 01:28:40,530
Get his helmet off before he chokes.

1113
01:28:46,930 --> 01:28:48,130
Shit!

1114
01:28:50,930 --> 01:28:52,930
Hands high. Against the wall.

1115
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:57,730
Okay. Easy with that.

1116
01:28:58,530 --> 01:29:00,530
Agh! Ugh!

1117
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:39,730
Guys, our man's down. Head for the roof.

1118
01:30:07,530 --> 01:30:09,130
Pennock! Head for the roof.

1119
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:12,630
We're on our way up now, boss.
Come on, move!

1120
01:30:38,330 --> 01:30:40,330
He jumped! He jumped!

1121
01:31:11,930 --> 01:31:13,930
Come on, come on! He's on the move.
Let's go!

1122
01:31:54,730 --> 01:31:56,630
Shh.

1123
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:00,430
Pennock?

1124
01:32:02,630 --> 01:32:04,030
Don't you do it.

1125
01:32:06,830 --> 01:32:08,730
There's no sign of him up here, boss.

1126
01:32:08,830 --> 01:32:11,830
I can see all the way to the river.
He's gone.

1127
01:32:24,130 --> 01:32:25,030
Shit.

1128
01:32:26,530 --> 01:32:28,330
Move and you're dead!

1129
01:32:31,030 --> 01:32:32,730
All right. Let's go, let's go.

1130
01:32:36,630 --> 01:32:37,730
Get in!

1131
01:32:58,530 --> 01:32:59,930
What is this?

1132
01:33:02,930 --> 01:33:04,330
That's for Campbell.

1133
01:33:06,630 --> 01:33:09,030
- And that's for Cregg.
- You finished?

1134
01:33:10,230 --> 01:33:11,630
We haven't even started!

1135
01:33:11,830 --> 01:33:13,130
Take the hood off.

1136
01:33:15,230 --> 01:33:17,030
Wait, boys.

1137
01:33:21,730 --> 01:33:23,530
Save a little bit for us, boss.

1138
01:33:27,030 --> 01:33:29,730
So why is he still alive?
Why didn't you kill him?

1139
01:33:31,030 --> 01:33:32,530
That what'd you'd have done?

1140
01:33:33,330 --> 01:33:35,030
I thought you were the good guys.

1141
01:33:35,230 --> 01:33:38,830
Who are you? Who do you work for?

1142
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:41,030
You and I have got a lot in common.

1143
01:33:41,230 --> 01:33:43,730
Really? You think so?

1144
01:33:43,930 --> 01:33:46,430
So you're sitting there tied to a chair,

1145
01:33:46,630 --> 01:33:49,030
and I'm standing here with
a gun in my hand.

1146
01:33:49,230 --> 01:33:52,830
Now you tell me
what the fuck this was all about!

1147
01:33:54,130 --> 01:33:55,430
Was?

1148
01:33:57,030 --> 01:33:58,630
You think this is over?

1149
01:33:58,830 --> 01:34:00,630
There'll be somebody else.

1150
01:34:00,730 --> 01:34:02,630
Your boy, Fiennes, is going to die.

1151
01:34:02,830 --> 01:34:04,230
Ugh!

1152
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:05,330
Argh!

1153
01:34:12,530 --> 01:34:15,630
Go on! Pull the trigger!
Kill me and you kill Fiennes!

1154
01:34:15,830 --> 01:34:16,930
They won't stop 'til they get him!

1155
01:34:17,130 --> 01:34:18,730
I stopped you, I'll stop them!

1156
01:34:18,830 --> 01:34:22,730
I didn't want to kill him. They will.

1157
01:34:23,930 --> 01:34:26,430
You put that in the right hands and
this thing's over.

1158
01:34:26,530 --> 01:34:27,730
The camera? Why?

1159
01:34:27,830 --> 01:34:31,430
Proof. Evidence that he's dead.

1160
01:34:33,030 --> 01:34:35,030
It's the only way you'll save him.

1161
01:34:36,130 --> 01:34:37,530
You tell me I walk,
I tell you who's behind this.

1162
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:39,630
And where to find him.

1163
01:34:41,830 --> 01:34:45,430
Okay. You walk.

1164
01:34:47,130 --> 01:34:49,330
Sheikh Amr bin Issa.

1165
01:34:49,730 --> 01:34:51,230
You'll find him in Oman.

1166
01:34:51,330 --> 01:34:52,230
Why?

1167
01:34:52,430 --> 01:34:53,430
The war.

1168
01:34:55,530 --> 01:34:57,330
They killed three of his sons.

1169
01:35:04,830 --> 01:35:05,730
Nuh.

1170
01:35:13,930 --> 01:35:15,730
Some good guy, eh?

1171
01:35:23,330 --> 01:35:24,530
Drop it.

1172
01:35:31,930 --> 01:35:33,030
Inside.

1173
01:35:39,930 --> 01:35:42,330
Beside him. On your knees.

1174
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:55,130
You were set up.

1175
01:35:55,230 --> 01:35:57,230
That's what we love about you lot.

1176
01:35:57,830 --> 01:36:00,030
You only care about the action.

1177
01:36:00,430 --> 01:36:05,630
Never think about what you might
really be fighting for. Or who.

1178
01:36:07,530 --> 01:36:09,730
Never see the big picture.

1179
01:36:14,330 --> 01:36:18,730
You're the one that was set up.
He just wouldn't get out of the way.

1180
01:36:20,630 --> 01:36:24,130
Her Majesty's Government doesn't like
secret societies.

1181
01:36:24,930 --> 01:36:27,530
Particularly when they get in the way
of our interests.

1182
01:36:28,630 --> 01:36:31,630
Do you know how much oil that pathetic
crust of desert is floating on?

1183
01:36:33,330 --> 01:36:34,330
Do you know what those contracts
are worth?

1184
01:36:34,430 --> 01:36:35,930
Three men's lives.

1185
01:36:36,130 --> 01:36:37,530
That's right.

1186
01:36:39,330 --> 01:36:40,630
That's right.

1187
01:36:40,730 --> 01:36:43,530
We deliver the killers,
son number four goes home,

1188
01:36:43,630 --> 01:36:48,230
and when Sheikhy re-ups the contracts
we get favourable consideration.

1189
01:36:48,830 --> 01:36:50,230
- A bargain.
- You bastard. You're a...

1190
01:36:50,430 --> 01:36:51,630
A patriot.

1191
01:36:51,730 --> 01:36:54,930
Who serves his country as
those three men did with their deaths.

1192
01:36:55,630 --> 01:36:57,030
As you will with yours.

1193
01:37:54,830 --> 01:37:56,030
Oh, holy crap!

1194
01:37:58,630 --> 01:37:59,330
What?!

1195
01:38:08,330 --> 01:38:10,130
Oi! You! Come back!

1196
01:38:26,730 --> 01:38:28,230
There she is.

1197
01:38:28,430 --> 01:38:30,430
Danny might have dropped off the radar,

1198
01:38:30,630 --> 01:38:34,530
but one thing's for sure,
he'll come back for her.

1199
01:38:34,730 --> 01:38:35,930
He'll come through that door

1200
01:38:36,030 --> 01:38:39,630
with six million dollars
and she won't be there.

1201
01:38:39,730 --> 01:38:44,130
Who don't you screw out of
his ten percent? Yours truly.

1202
01:38:45,530 --> 01:38:46,630
Boss.

1203
01:38:51,030 --> 01:38:52,030
Deal with him.

1204
01:38:59,830 --> 01:39:01,130
Ugh!

1205
01:39:04,830 --> 01:39:05,930
Aagh!

1206
01:40:08,830 --> 01:40:12,730
It wasn't personal. It's just business.

1207
01:40:14,430 --> 01:40:18,630
You played us. I don't care why.

1208
01:40:18,730 --> 01:40:21,930
But if ever a lying piece of shit
needed killing, it was you.

1209
01:40:26,330 --> 01:40:27,330
Game's over.

1210
01:40:27,430 --> 01:40:28,730
You know I wouldn't have hurt her.

1211
01:40:29,730 --> 01:40:32,630
I just wanted my cut.
She was only collateral.

1212
01:40:40,930 --> 01:40:42,430
You go after them,

1213
01:40:43,330 --> 01:40:45,730
I'll find you.

1214
01:40:45,830 --> 01:40:49,830
Remember, everybody gets found.
Even you.

1215
01:41:04,830 --> 01:41:05,930
You got to get those photos to
that old bastard

1216
01:41:06,030 --> 01:41:08,730
and finish this thing for good,
you hear kiddo?

1217
01:41:08,830 --> 01:41:11,030
That's why I'm here. What about you?

1218
01:41:11,630 --> 01:41:13,130
Babysitting's over, kiddo.

1219
01:41:14,630 --> 01:41:15,130
Who says?

1220
01:41:15,330 --> 01:41:17,730
I say. She's safe.
You're the one taking the chances now.

1221
01:41:17,930 --> 01:41:18,430
Come on.

1222
01:41:18,630 --> 01:41:20,730
Come on?
You walked into a trap last time,

1223
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:22,730
you think I'm going to
let you do that again?

1224
01:41:22,830 --> 01:41:24,530
I told your girl you were going to
be coming back to her...

1225
01:41:24,630 --> 01:41:25,630
you wanna make a liar out of me?

1226
01:41:25,730 --> 01:41:28,430
Yeah, well you were supposed to
be guarding her, not interviewing her.

1227
01:41:28,630 --> 01:41:31,330
Well, I was always a sucker for
a pretty face, no denying that.

1228
01:41:31,530 --> 01:41:34,030
She's a keeper, that's for sure.

1229
01:41:35,230 --> 01:41:36,930
She doesn't know, does she?

1230
01:41:37,130 --> 01:41:38,130
Some.

1231
01:41:38,830 --> 01:41:39,330
Yeah, it's going to be tough.

1232
01:41:39,530 --> 01:41:42,730
My old man used to say life's like
licking honey from a thorn.

1233
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:44,130
Yeah, what does that mean?

1234
01:41:44,230 --> 01:41:46,330
Something about good times
and bad times.

1235
01:41:46,430 --> 01:41:49,530
Seems like it's been all thorns
for us lately. Both of us.

1236
01:41:49,730 --> 01:41:51,130
All right. Let's finish this.

1237
01:41:51,830 --> 01:41:53,130
I'll be top cover.

1238
01:41:53,330 --> 01:41:55,430
If anything goes wrong, I'm coming in.

1239
01:41:55,530 --> 01:41:58,330
Hey, look, the Sheikh wants this over.
It's in, hand over the photos and out.

1240
01:41:58,430 --> 01:41:58,930
Yeah?

1241
01:41:59,130 --> 01:42:01,030
Yeah. There isn't gonna be a problem.

1242
01:42:01,830 --> 01:42:03,630
From your mouth to God's ears.

1243
01:42:03,830 --> 01:42:06,230
Don't move 'til I give the all clear,
okay.

1244
01:42:26,630 --> 01:42:29,530
Who are you? What do you want?

1245
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:34,130
For the Sheikh.

1246
01:42:35,930 --> 01:42:38,230
I have to see it placed in his hands.

1247
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:52,730
Take these to my people.

1248
01:42:52,930 --> 01:42:55,430
Show them what I have done.

1249
01:42:57,830 --> 01:42:59,630
I have a message for the Sheikh.

1250
01:43:06,230 --> 01:43:08,030
He's still alive.

1251
01:43:11,630 --> 01:43:13,030
They're fakes.

1252
01:43:16,530 --> 01:43:17,930
But this is going to end.

1253
01:43:32,930 --> 01:43:34,430
I don't care.

1254
01:43:35,430 --> 01:43:36,630
Huh?

1255
01:43:37,030 --> 01:43:42,830
What would I do huh?
In that god forsaken desert!

1256
01:43:48,530 --> 01:43:50,330
Have you forgotten something?

1257
01:44:07,630 --> 01:44:09,130
Hold it, hold it. Stay where you are.

1258
01:44:09,230 --> 01:44:10,830
Something's not right.

1259
01:44:18,830 --> 01:44:19,930
You see this?

1260
01:44:20,130 --> 01:44:21,330
Yeah, I see it.

1261
01:44:27,830 --> 01:44:29,430
Looks like we're in the wrong place.

1262
01:44:48,830 --> 01:44:49,830
Let's go, let's go!

1263
01:45:30,730 --> 01:45:32,430
Relax. I only killed the car.

1264
01:46:15,930 --> 01:46:17,030
You again.

1265
01:46:26,230 --> 01:46:29,430
Back at the Palace.
What happened in there?

1266
01:46:31,230 --> 01:46:33,530
He was there,
waiting for a message from you.

1267
01:46:33,630 --> 01:46:35,330
I was the messenger.

1268
01:46:35,430 --> 01:46:36,530
And?

1269
01:46:36,630 --> 01:46:37,930
What do you think?

1270
01:46:38,730 --> 01:46:41,630
His boy in there didn't give a shit.
He's not going back to the desert,

1271
01:46:41,730 --> 01:46:43,930
so there'll be no oil contracts.

1272
01:46:45,030 --> 01:46:46,730
It was all for nothing.

1273
01:46:46,930 --> 01:46:48,430
Is that right?

1274
01:47:01,030 --> 01:47:02,730
And the winner is...

1275
01:47:03,830 --> 01:47:05,230
So that's what this is all about?

1276
01:47:05,430 --> 01:47:08,030
Yeah. It's all hookers
and blow from here on in.

1277
01:47:08,630 --> 01:47:10,630
You just don't get it, do you?

1278
01:47:13,130 --> 01:47:13,830
Ditch it.

1279
01:47:14,030 --> 01:47:15,430
You sure?

1280
01:47:15,830 --> 01:47:17,530
Ditch it.

1281
01:47:19,230 --> 01:47:21,130
I gotta cover my expenses.

1282
01:47:23,130 --> 01:47:24,430
You can't go back to England.

1283
01:47:24,630 --> 01:47:25,830
Not after killing that Spook.

1284
01:47:25,930 --> 01:47:27,130
Who the fuck are you?

1285
01:47:27,230 --> 01:47:29,630
Who? Me? The voice of experience.

1286
01:47:29,830 --> 01:47:30,430
Where are you going to go?

1287
01:47:30,530 --> 01:47:31,730
What are you going to do?

1288
01:47:31,830 --> 01:47:32,730
You're gonna need this.

1289
01:47:33,430 --> 01:47:35,830
New name, new face, new papers.

1290
01:47:35,930 --> 01:47:38,330
Expensive. You'll see.

1291
01:47:47,630 --> 01:47:49,130
Damn shame.

1292
01:47:53,230 --> 01:47:55,030
You think you get to just walk away?

1293
01:47:55,930 --> 01:47:57,530
Nobody walks away.

1294
01:47:58,230 --> 01:48:00,830
Not me, you, none of us.

1295
01:48:01,530 --> 01:48:03,330
The old man you just killed,

1296
01:48:04,530 --> 01:48:07,630
he told me a war isn't over 'til
both sides say it is.

1297
01:48:07,730 --> 01:48:10,330
Well, I'm telling you now,
this is over for me.

1298
01:48:10,430 --> 01:48:12,130
Really? And what?
You want me to say, Me too"?

1299
01:48:12,330 --> 01:48:14,130
And then it's happy ever after.

1300
01:48:14,230 --> 01:48:15,530
Your choice.

1301
01:48:15,630 --> 01:48:17,730
You know, when I got this,
they told me my war was over.

1302
01:48:17,930 --> 01:48:21,130
I told them they were full of shit.
Now I'm telling it to you.

1303
01:48:21,530 --> 01:48:23,130
Let it go.

1304
01:48:29,730 --> 01:48:31,030
So where are you going?

1305
01:48:31,330 --> 01:48:33,030
Why? You planning a visit?

1306
01:48:33,530 --> 01:48:35,030
You never know.

1307
01:48:37,530 --> 01:48:40,730
If you come, I'll be waiting.

1308
01:48:46,930 --> 01:48:48,930
We'll call you a cab from the airport.

1309
01:49:11,730 --> 01:49:15,630
Hey. Aren't you Anne Frazer?
The girl with those weird gumboots?

1310
01:49:17,630 --> 01:49:19,830
Are you Danny Bryce,
the boy who went away?

1311
01:49:19,930 --> 01:49:22,730
Yeah. I'm back.

1312
01:49:23,530 --> 01:49:24,830
Where you headed?

1313
01:49:25,930 --> 01:49:27,230
I don't know.

1314
01:49:27,430 --> 01:49:30,530
Me neither. Want to come along?

00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
