3
00:01:26,561 --> 00:01:31,551
What are you doing?
You've got to eat here?

4
00:01:31,552 --> 00:01:34,643
Yes, very dapper.

5
00:01:34,644 --> 00:01:38,143
Any idea why is that?
- That?

6
00:01:38,144 --> 00:01:41,723
Free chicken. So the locals call it.

7
00:01:41,724 --> 00:01:45,156
You get rid of headaches,
about all diseases.

8
00:01:45,157 --> 00:01:46,946
It's an iguana.

9
00:01:46,947 --> 00:01:56,147
I think I do indigestion. Tool Iguana.

10
00:01:57,704 --> 00:01:58,658
- Well, we are in Salvador.
- Yes.

11
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:02,231
- Sucks.
- But in Angola? The food is good there, right?

12
00:02:02,232 --> 00:02:05,906
Shit.
- In Dijou?

13
00:02:05,907 --> 00:02:08,612
Shit, shit.

14
00:02:08,613 --> 00:02:12,212
Sure, in New York ...
-... of shit.

15
00:02:12,213 --> 00:02:15,369
I think it went better in Hawaii.
You'll get the job done in New York.

16
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,689
There will be a problem.
We have enough cattle there.

17
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:25,690
It's time to move, kid.

18
00:02:48,723 --> 00:02:52,123
Yes, yes yes.

19
00:04:51,276 --> 00:04:52,676
Damn.

20
00:05:01,654 --> 00:05:04,054
Sit down!

21
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,793
Sit down kid!

22
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,278
What happened?
- He was a child in the car.

23
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,279
Go!

24
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:53,751
I'm done with it.

25
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,340
I can not do that.

26
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:04,141
I can not do that.

27
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,538
Film based on real facts

28
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:26,139
A year later Australia. Yacc Valley.

29
00:07:04,813 --> 00:07:06,213
Damn!

30
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:19,527
Damn!

31
00:07:40,955 --> 00:07:46,001
You have arrived. This car is so
Imputita that I can to get my hands on it.

32
00:07:46,002 --> 00:07:49,224
Where is it? - The client
still it has. - Which client?

33
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:52,300
Go there now.

34
00:07:52,301 --> 00:07:57,501
All right. Let's go.

35
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:03,742
The client knows the sheik.

36
00:08:03,743 --> 00:08:07,773
Before there was a great
leader until he was ousted.

37
00:08:07,774 --> 00:08:10,344
He lives in the desert since.

38
00:08:10,345 --> 00:08:19,145
However, you want to do finish work.

39
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:24,851
And?
- You know the rest. Have you received the package.

40
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:27,713
Yes, I received.

41
00:08:27,714 --> 00:08:32,085
What is the mission.
- I have details.

42
00:08:32,086 --> 00:08:41,486
How rich is he?
- It has $ 6 billion.

43
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:48,671
I the money, do business and go. Do you understand?
- Yes.

44
00:08:48,672 --> 00:08:52,484
I finished with him.
- It seems that he has not finished with you.

45
00:08:52,485 --> 00:08:56,180
Danny needs the old
one. Best of the guild.

46
00:08:56,181 --> 00:08:58,847
The one with balls of
steel. Remember him?

47
00:08:58,848 --> 00:09:07,648
If you do not work, Hunter is dead.

48
00:09:11,577 --> 00:09:15,577
Waiting for you.

49
00:10:02,173 --> 00:10:02,853
This way.

50
00:10:02,854 --> 00:10:07,753
- Wait for your eyes
and used to the light.

51
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:12,954
Be careful here, boy.

52
00:10:14,187 --> 00:10:19,623
My son forget the rules
desert. Since the war

53
00:10:19,624 --> 00:10:25,486
was finished, I left only with this map.

54
00:10:25,487 --> 00:10:35,229
My first son, Hussein,
was slaughtered here ...

55
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,474
decopii before his ...

56
00:10:38,475 --> 00:10:45,671
and here, at the battle of Murhbad brother
Its Salim, was wounded and then killed.

57
00:10:45,672 --> 00:10:48,072
Killed ...

58
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:57,950
And then the third son,
I was taken ... Ali ...

59
00:10:57,951 --> 00:11:03,151
Hunted and slaughtered

60
00:11:03,324 --> 00:11:09,196
Desert Law says that the blood of victims
blood should be wiped with criminals.

61
00:11:09,197 --> 00:11:14,415
But vengeance and I refuse
to send My last son in war.

62
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:18,411
I was exiled to the desert.

63
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:24,737
I had, wealth, everything I want ...

64
00:11:24,738 --> 00:11:30,346
but I want to go home to my tribe.

65
00:11:30,347 --> 00:11:35,492
But to have it, criminals
my sons to be killed.

66
00:11:35,493 --> 00:11:37,737
And you need a hunter for this.

67
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:43,264
There's enough here?
- What would I use it in England?

68
00:11:43,265 --> 00:11:45,265
England?

69
00:11:46,944 --> 00:11:52,107
England has sent dogs to kill my sons.

70
00:11:52,108 --> 00:11:57,386
S.A.S. Yes, glorious special forces.

71
00:11:57,387 --> 00:12:00,313
You were at war.
- It was not war England.

72
00:12:00,314 --> 00:12:03,673
They came on my land and I get killed?

73
00:12:03,674 --> 00:12:09,990
Now will give an account of my law.
Doc says I have 6 months to live.

74
00:12:09,991 --> 00:12:15,397
You must avenge my sons die before
or your friend will die with me.

75
00:12:15,398 --> 00:12:20,668
I do not care how you kill them,
but we must recognize the box.

76
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:24,327
And the murders have
appear as an accident.

77
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:27,332
These need to reach my son.

78
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:35,909
So it goes. Spuenel English that
will sfarsii war, on both sides.

79
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:41,310
I want to see Hunter.

80
00:12:54,752 --> 00:12:59,352
Danny? No, no, no.

81
00:12:59,736 --> 00:13:03,936
Get out of here.

82
00:13:07,331 --> 00:13:10,937
Get out of here. Now, now, now.

83
00:13:10,938 --> 00:13:13,621
You see someone. I thought the girls.

84
00:13:13,622 --> 00:13:16,022
No?
- I.

85
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,954
What does that mean?
- Had to put food on the table.

86
00:13:21,955 --> 00:13:26,799
What nourishes you? 6
million, no questions asked?

87
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,052
You need to know it's a trap mission.
- Yes, I know.

88
00:13:29,053 --> 00:13:32,757
How to say not so, when I had a ticket?

89
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:42,708
You have accepted the mission,
and I will not leave you here.

90
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:48,321
Give a man a drink.

91
00:13:48,322 --> 00:13:53,175
I've Lisp. I knew that any day
without you, is a problem for me.

92
00:13:53,176 --> 00:13:56,767
I was proud when you retired.

93
00:13:56,768 --> 00:13:58,746
Stay out.

94
00:13:58,747 --> 00:14:00,830
Too late.

95
00:14:00,831 --> 00:14:04,166
You should stay away.

96
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:08,167
But I'm faster.

97
00:15:02,845 --> 00:15:05,609
Motherfucker.

98
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:15,560
What are you doing?
- I take back ceasu.

99
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:36,932
Go, go!

100
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,958
Go to the door.

101
00:16:05,109 --> 00:16:09,309
I need a weapon.

102
00:16:15,793 --> 00:16:18,301
Bravo, bravo!

103
00:16:18,302 --> 00:16:25,902
You do not have to shoot them.

104
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:34,382
Nice try.
- My father needs her alive.

105
00:16:34,383 --> 00:16:42,705
Nice try. You know
that you found anyway.

106
00:16:42,706 --> 00:16:46,306
All are found.

107
00:16:49,347 --> 00:16:55,145
I know I know the targets, you know
everything. Have you used as bait.

108
00:16:55,146 --> 00:17:00,470
You think I'm so smart?

109
00:17:00,471 --> 00:17:06,071
Get out. And you, out.

110
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:34,162
I missed you last night at the dance.
- I do not know how to dance.

111
00:17:34,163 --> 00:17:37,145
For without this, try to
make something good out of it.

112
00:17:37,146 --> 00:17:45,146
You have big plans!
- Absolutely.

113
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:51,209
Do not remember me, right?

114
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:55,716
Some time has passed.

115
00:17:55,717 --> 00:17:58,517
I am that.

116
00:18:02,078 --> 00:18:03,891
Anne Freizer

117
00:18:03,892 --> 00:18:13,842
And I took pictures
in front of the garage.

118
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:22,463
Paris, France

119
00:18:28,032 --> 00:18:34,875
You owe me a chance. I
told you that we meet.

120
00:18:34,876 --> 00:18:36,916
We missed you.

121
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:40,917
Yes? Here I am.

122
00:18:41,281 --> 00:18:46,769
You want a piece of me?

123
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,964
I still can. Still you're the top.

124
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:53,565
A real killer.

125
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:07,744
Now depend on it.
- It's Hunter.

126
00:19:07,745 --> 00:19:11,629
Look e. I'll go after S.A.S.

127
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:20,030
I'm paranoid. Always have coverage.

128
00:19:24,907 --> 00:19:31,186
I'll try to do to speak. That
will not ever. And four, Danny ...

129
00:19:31,187 --> 00:19:36,209
They are the best. SEALS
are a lot of bombonele.

130
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:41,658
And besides that, want everything
to look like an accident.

131
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:44,950
All I ask is you think about.

132
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:49,219
Over a day or two, go anyway.

133
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,610
Of course that enter. That we do not?

134
00:19:52,611 --> 00:19:58,355
I have something to do. We are in Paris,
and I want to make a game with four.

135
00:19:58,356 --> 00:20:00,354
What? You do not want?

136
00:20:00,355 --> 00:20:05,835
You want this bottle tucked in the anus?
- Are you mad? You want a lollipop?

137
00:20:05,836 --> 00:20:11,747
I would like!
- Grape or give you n matt?

138
00:20:11,748 --> 00:20:15,852
Are you with us? - Yes. -
Why? - 6 million reasons?

139
00:20:15,853 --> 00:20:20,426
And how divided? -
After spending Jumi-half.

140
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,835
For you two.
- Jumi-half?

141
00:20:22,836 --> 00:20:25,431
But you?
- I have other reasons.

142
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:30,542
Moving.
- Yes, but stupid.

143
00:20:30,543 --> 00:20:34,949
We located two killers. I want
you to locate them on others.

144
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:44,900
That's one of Murhbad.
This is Douglas Harris.

145
00:20:47,054 --> 00:20:56,766
Meanwhile we must
locate. - Cheers? - Danny?

146
00:20:56,767 --> 00:20:59,767
Muscat. Oman

147
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:19,021
Harris, you idiot.

148
00:21:20,207 --> 00:21:22,407
Get out!

149
00:21:33,948 --> 00:21:37,348
Comes to you.

150
00:25:31,127 --> 00:25:38,575
I do not know who he
is. I sent to the local.

151
00:25:38,576 --> 00:25:43,634
You have chosen the right man.
- I know that not done this for some time.

152
00:25:43,635 --> 00:25:49,597
Protect former SAS. And
you Mike, you were SAS.

153
00:25:49,598 --> 00:25:52,416
Remember. We are back in action.

154
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:57,528
What we do here, is illegal.
We must not leave marks.

155
00:25:57,529 --> 00:26:06,488
That's what you call it.
It's a little sensitive.

156
00:26:06,489 --> 00:26:14,024
- I lost a good soldier.
- But but the problem is that they believe in SAS.

157
00:26:14,025 --> 00:26:17,509
Someone has to do dirty work.

158
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,466
I have a problem with blood.

159
00:26:20,467 --> 00:26:23,605
But for him? E Ink.

160
00:26:23,606 --> 00:26:26,137
Take care that keeps
us out of newspapers.

161
00:26:26,138 --> 00:26:35,203
S do boss!
- Since we are in, right?

162
00:26:35,204 --> 00:26:36,804
Lucky.

163
00:26:51,656 --> 00:26:53,298
Where to stay?

164
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:56,252
Staying at the Hilton.
- Me too!

165
00:26:56,253 --> 00:27:06,203
What room?
- Why would you want to know?

166
00:27:16,731 --> 00:27:18,751
What we do here in
the middle of nowhere?

167
00:27:18,752 --> 00:27:22,150
You said to hide? I hid
them. Could be your anus.

168
00:27:22,151 --> 00:27:24,794
You're lucky.
- Shut your mouth.

169
00:27:24,795 --> 00:27:31,195
I appreciate.
- Thank you.

170
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:48,381
A tip to hit him here. Case closed.
- Get out of here.

171
00:27:48,382 --> 00:27:53,423
You misunderstand.
- That bitch is married.

172
00:27:53,424 --> 00:27:58,584
While I've been traso.
- What have you drawn?

173
00:27:58,585 --> 00:28:08,535
It is part of the past. We
are the footsteps of Harris.

174
00:28:09,524 --> 00:28:15,724
What club?
- The killers.

175
00:28:18,935 --> 00:28:20,741
To do the job.

176
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:25,542
It's a royal jerk.

177
00:28:32,647 --> 00:28:34,047
Damn.

178
00:28:41,431 --> 00:28:51,381
Where will we run?
We are in full desert.

179
00:28:56,961 --> 00:29:01,761
Go to another exit.

180
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:09,410
Where is it?

181
00:29:49,763 --> 00:29:53,963
Get out of here.

182
00:29:57,818 --> 00:30:00,757
Someone is on our trail?
- We must move quickly.

183
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:10,708
Before Harris to find out. Let
the girl alone. Not involved.

184
00:30:23,842 --> 00:30:26,842
Motherfucker.

185
00:30:36,703 --> 00:30:42,953
You stay quiet. I'll talk, okay?

186
00:30:42,954 --> 00:30:51,323
What you wanted to show my documents?

187
00:30:51,324 --> 00:30:54,396
Have a seat.

188
00:30:54,397 --> 00:30:59,997
Those bastards put you?

189
00:31:23,972 --> 00:31:28,290
What happened. I have
not had enough sun?

190
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:31,898
Hi guys! I'm not saying
anything until I see lawyers.

191
00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:41,849
Further back. You killed a
man on a mission. Recognize?

192
00:31:46,686 --> 00:31:48,179
Disappear.

193
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:54,646
You're kidding, right?
- You were in command.

194
00:31:54,647 --> 00:31:59,027
Yes.
- You killed a man.

195
00:31:59,028 --> 00:32:08,290
There were witnesses.
- You killed him in front of his family.

196
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:11,592
Yes. I got it. I did.

197
00:32:11,593 --> 00:32:14,086
Give me a break.

198
00:32:14,087 --> 00:32:17,112
Untie me.
- High.

199
00:32:17,113 --> 00:32:19,713
Hey! Gone!

200
00:32:20,643 --> 00:32:27,926
We have what we need.
- And if you say that someone intervened?

201
00:32:27,927 --> 00:32:32,178
His name is?
- I do not remember.

202
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:35,072
But it's in the book of the mission.

203
00:32:35,073 --> 00:32:37,681
You'll find it there.

204
00:32:37,682 --> 00:32:39,570
If you can read.

205
00:32:39,571 --> 00:32:41,458
The bathroom.

206
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:51,409
No. Wait. You're an
asshole. D-A-B-I-T-O-C

207
00:32:52,465 --> 00:32:54,847
You're dead.

208
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:57,048
In knee.

209
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:03,815
Capu put down.

210
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:09,216
Kidding.
- Stay still.

211
00:33:21,784 --> 00:33:24,946
I need money for taxi.
You have to take a taxi.

212
00:33:24,947 --> 00:33:27,747
I made up.

213
00:33:52,154 --> 00:33:55,154
Case closed.

214
00:34:20,297 --> 00:34:29,297
It seems that your friend gives best.

215
00:34:33,412 --> 00:34:38,387
What do you mean?
- Your brother is dead. You're his only son ...

216
00:34:38,388 --> 00:34:40,777
Do not you want to take revenge.

217
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:45,740
Let your hands dirty.
You better get used to.

218
00:34:45,741 --> 00:34:50,483
It's no palace where you're
headed. Just a shit hole.

219
00:34:50,484 --> 00:34:55,102
It's your worst nightmare. And will.

220
00:34:55,103 --> 00:34:59,401
And when it does, you will leave here. And
when you find yourself in the desert, I pray

221
00:34:59,402 --> 00:35:03,602
God help me aim.

222
00:35:21,949 --> 00:35:29,740
What do you think?
- Begins to take shape.

223
00:35:29,741 --> 00:35:37,141
What are you doing for dinner?

224
00:35:44,273 --> 00:35:49,801
Aliens are something exotic here.
- No foreign

225
00:35:49,802 --> 00:35:55,353
But you are exotic. And
something tells me that you told.

226
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:56,554
Yes.

227
00:36:08,924 --> 00:36:11,269
Come! What are you waiting for?

228
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:14,870
Let's go out.

229
00:36:18,401 --> 00:36:22,001
Happy Birthday!

230
00:36:22,242 --> 00:36:24,831
It's a tradition here.

231
00:36:24,832 --> 00:36:28,432
Happy Birthday!

232
00:36:49,951 --> 00:36:54,280
Captain Steven Douglas Harris ...

233
00:36:54,281 --> 00:36:55,481
Damn

234
00:37:10,513 --> 00:37:14,305
Not bad at all. Address is on the back.

235
00:37:14,306 --> 00:37:17,313
I talked to him.

236
00:37:17,314 --> 00:37:21,716
One more thing. My boys have had problems.
- In Oman?

237
00:37:21,717 --> 00:37:23,500
Someone poured.

238
00:37:23,501 --> 00:37:26,828
You should see who is not?

239
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:28,029
Yes.

240
00:37:37,102 --> 00:37:42,526
Looks better as time
last. - What? - Photos.

241
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:46,334
It is not plagiarism?
- Recreate a historical event.

242
00:37:46,335 --> 00:37:51,535
I can see everything.

243
00:37:53,648 --> 00:37:57,518
I have an address for him.
- Are you with SAS?

244
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:58,343
I was.

245
00:37:58,344 --> 00:38:03,125
The best thing would be to
find the address, is to you ...

246
00:38:03,126 --> 00:38:06,045
I spent the last years with this.

247
00:38:06,046 --> 00:38:12,268
And besides that. We
come to you formally.

248
00:38:12,269 --> 00:38:17,864
I could send someone.
I pay a few minutes?

249
00:38:17,865 --> 00:38:19,065
Yes.

250
00:38:34,495 --> 00:38:38,951
Vrajeala came with me. He
says part of the regiment.

251
00:38:38,952 --> 00:38:48,902
I did not he could refuse.
Yes. It's full of vrajeli.

252
00:39:08,422 --> 00:39:11,161
My informants say that it was canceled.

253
00:39:11,162 --> 00:39:15,777
But someone asked
Murhbag. It must be him.

254
00:39:15,778 --> 00:39:17,542
And you want to do us?

255
00:39:17,543 --> 00:39:19,322
Find it.

256
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:22,150
If not, will I be another murder
and will be one of our boys.

257
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:25,409
Who are.
- Professionals. That's for sure.

258
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:29,422
If you come after SAS to
be professional killers.

259
00:39:29,423 --> 00:39:32,438
Must have some history in the field.

260
00:39:32,439 --> 00:39:35,385
Are found. I found in Oman.

261
00:39:35,386 --> 00:39:38,676
Oman?
- Exceeded our people there.

262
00:39:38,677 --> 00:39:44,100
Oman? Murhbad should be left alone.
- You must find "The Departed"

263
00:39:44,101 --> 00:39:50,888
He's right. Have found the Book.

264
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:55,375
It says that one of the officers SAS
killed a son of Sheikh in Murhbad.

265
00:39:55,376 --> 00:40:00,761
Steven Warren Crick.
It was there that night.

266
00:40:00,762 --> 00:40:04,221
It's our worst nightmare. Dangerous.

267
00:40:04,222 --> 00:40:05,648
Where did you get that?

268
00:40:05,649 --> 00:40:11,028
The paintings have needed
blood. I killed another officer.

269
00:40:11,029 --> 00:40:16,871
It was part of the business.
- That sort of thing happen.

270
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:20,737
To follow the plan, huh?

271
00:40:20,738 --> 00:40:22,467
Crick. What is?

272
00:40:22,468 --> 00:40:30,447
- Spends time in addition to a team.
- Why do not we go there?

273
00:40:30,448 --> 00:40:40,398
No. To wait. Let's see what will happen.

274
00:40:48,598 --> 00:40:56,541
There are 4. We take care of the
other three. You get that celebrity.

275
00:40:56,542 --> 00:40:59,849
E Warren Crick. Without cool.

276
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:02,650
I did not.

277
00:41:03,117 --> 00:41:06,464
Welcome to hell. SAS selection march.

278
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:13,372
41 miles, 28 kg of equipment,
May decrease one kg each year.

279
00:41:13,373 --> 00:41:16,546
Do not even think about.
- Why not?

280
00:41:16,547 --> 00:41:19,087
That's the cruel march of all the SAS.

281
00:41:19,088 --> 00:41:22,707
Yes? You said it
yourself. Accidents happen.

282
00:41:22,708 --> 00:41:26,951
Do not understand. Try
on Monday. It's not easy.

283
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:31,679
It means that we must slow down, right?

284
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:37,080
Insulin, ... Sign here.

285
00:41:46,517 --> 00:41:50,966
He finished.
- No, Crick is still there with his mistress.

286
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:58,367
Boss. It crushed the big girl.

287
00:42:20,148 --> 00:42:26,548
I want to come here soon.

288
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:29,363
Move along.

289
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:46,831
I can not believe it.
Both took care of Crick.

290
00:46:46,832 --> 00:46:49,632
I think they are the same as those of the desert?
- Maybe.

291
00:46:49,633 --> 00:46:52,435
It's good. But it was too late.

292
00:46:52,436 --> 00:47:01,915
Good. That slows it.
Insulin puts him in shock.

293
00:47:01,916 --> 00:47:02,447
Hiportermie.

294
00:47:02,448 --> 00:47:04,694
And how you plan to plant them drugs?

295
00:47:04,695 --> 00:47:07,399
Before the march.

296
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:17,350
SAS is one thing.
- You've trained them. Think about it.

297
00:47:17,386 --> 00:47:20,872
You're crazy.
- I do it?

298
00:47:20,873 --> 00:47:25,873
Danny, you're crazy.

299
00:47:31,036 --> 00:47:39,036
SAS. General Headquarters. Hersford

300
00:47:40,059 --> 00:47:50,009
Time is running out.
You, more Putna a minute.

301
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:59,583
We have company.

302
00:49:16,233 --> 00:49:24,954
The trucks! Go to the
regiments of which belong!

303
00:49:24,955 --> 00:49:28,955
In trucks. Come!

304
00:49:55,682 --> 00:50:00,026
She drank half. It is enough?

305
00:50:00,027 --> 00:50:07,027
Yes. I put much more, right?

306
00:50:26,122 --> 00:50:31,116
Do you remember?
- Have you killed?

307
00:50:31,117 --> 00:50:34,717
Yes, I killed.

308
00:50:35,289 --> 00:50:40,235
Danny would not do that.

309
00:50:40,236 --> 00:50:50,186
Your boy does not want
to go to the desert.

310
00:50:57,036 --> 00:51:01,836
Today an officer ...

311
00:51:03,582 --> 00:51:09,650
Steven Crick, was found ...

312
00:51:09,651 --> 00:51:17,651
His condition was described as ...

313
00:51:29,351 --> 00:51:33,751
Show some respect.

314
00:51:43,003 --> 00:51:45,013
Left corner.

315
00:51:45,014 --> 00:51:49,214
We brought gifts.

316
00:51:51,811 --> 00:51:54,411
In Angola.

317
00:51:56,710 --> 00:52:02,016
You do not want to eat those.

318
00:52:02,017 --> 00:52:06,179
Where is our target.
- Another look. Do not worry.

319
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:12,300
But one more thing. After that
Yes you can work in "full sun".

320
00:52:12,301 --> 00:52:18,301
There's no "after that."

321
00:52:18,685 --> 00:52:22,216
Are intermediate. Looking killers.

322
00:52:22,217 --> 00:52:30,325
Here's a unique perspective.
Mercenaries, heroes ...

323
00:52:30,326 --> 00:52:33,972
2% of them are part of criminal.

324
00:52:33,973 --> 00:52:41,134
Therefore you will not give up.
You can not escape who you are.

325
00:52:41,135 --> 00:52:44,976
That's not what I represent.

326
00:52:44,977 --> 00:52:47,557
And can do something else.

327
00:52:47,558 --> 00:52:52,558
Let's talk business.

328
00:52:53,811 --> 00:53:01,611
The third target is Simon Mc? ..

329
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:18,157
You know where to find me one?

330
00:53:18,158 --> 00:53:20,608
Do not trust him, right?

331
00:53:20,609 --> 00:53:28,449
Mind. - Yes. - I
have moved his lips.

332
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:32,628
Someone following us.
- I want Hunter out there. I want to end it.

333
00:53:32,629 --> 00:53:34,422
I want to enjoy my money.

334
00:53:34,423 --> 00:53:38,304
But first you have to
take a pair of balls.

335
00:53:38,305 --> 00:53:41,905
Go after McCan

336
00:53:46,961 --> 00:53:53,642
I miss you. I do not know many
about you, but even so I know.

337
00:53:53,643 --> 00:53:59,271
I am convinced that everything is ok,
because when they are with you, I feel happy.

338
00:53:59,272 --> 00:54:03,575
And then go and realize that
I know nothing about you.

339
00:54:03,576 --> 00:54:11,615
I do not know where you go, you do.

340
00:54:11,616 --> 00:54:16,404
May you somebody? -
No. - Then what is it?

341
00:54:16,405 --> 00:54:19,227
Why not me? What hide?

342
00:54:19,228 --> 00:54:28,828
I do not want to get into it.
- Damn.

343
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:46,478
What?
- If your friend show me a to show you that you can for blood.

344
00:54:46,479 --> 00:54:51,900
Shut up.
- I understand.

345
00:54:51,901 --> 00:54:57,301
He e.
- I saw McCan.

346
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:07,633
Boy, go.
- Carats.

347
00:55:13,847 --> 00:55:23,797
As I said. Can not help
it. It's a psychopath.

348
00:55:25,041 --> 00:55:26,441
Lord!

349
00:55:31,616 --> 00:55:34,628
Why are you here?

350
00:55:34,629 --> 00:55:41,832
I had a meeting with
him to the hospital.

351
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:45,033
Yes.
- Wait.

352
00:55:51,667 --> 00:55:54,267
Let's go.

353
00:56:33,403 --> 00:56:36,343
Mac, I am. Are you okay?

354
00:56:36,344 --> 00:56:39,796
Yes. Another piece of leather
cleaner on the porch of my house.

355
00:56:39,797 --> 00:56:41,597
Verify.

356
00:56:55,031 --> 00:56:58,950
The name is Spy Blogen.
It is the next soldier.

357
00:56:58,951 --> 00:57:02,744
Was seen. Make a hero somewhere.

358
00:57:02,745 --> 00:57:08,411
It does not work and
is always in the house,

359
00:57:08,412 --> 00:57:13,122
Do not know who I am? I mean,
Your secrets are small finger.

360
00:57:13,123 --> 00:57:15,918
Do not worry.
- Yes, I worry.

361
00:57:15,919 --> 00:57:20,075
And you should. Any movement
are mine, these lie ahead.

362
00:57:20,076 --> 00:57:25,318
You want my opinion. I think
we should break to beat someone.

363
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:31,519
Yes, but nobody asks you.

364
00:57:33,346 --> 00:57:36,996
You had security post, Mr. McCan.

365
00:57:36,997 --> 00:57:41,311
I found through a mutual friend SAS.

366
00:57:41,312 --> 00:57:44,909
See you Tuesday at 5.10 pm

367
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:49,316
I can not wait.
- See you. - Okay.

368
00:57:49,317 --> 00:57:55,619
Will be there. - Okay.
- I do not understand.

369
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:59,206
McCan lives here. Will
be here for the interview.

370
00:57:59,207 --> 00:58:05,533
I go on here. "Boston brakes"

371
00:58:05,534 --> 00:58:07,600
Perfect.
- It was so perfect in Boston.

372
00:58:07,601 --> 00:58:10,138
I lost control.
- I have done in 10 days.

373
00:58:10,139 --> 00:58:15,088
10 days? I need some help.

374
00:58:15,089 --> 00:58:20,506
All right.
- McCan is supervised. How do you do to recognize.

375
00:58:20,507 --> 00:58:27,473
We will not get. We will do a fake.

376
00:58:27,474 --> 00:58:36,474
We play where we recognize and break.

377
00:58:47,117 --> 00:58:52,137
Who are you?
- I'm not flying with helicopter with a gun in your pocket.

378
00:58:52,138 --> 00:58:54,665
I can call Mifwich.
- Mifwich ...

379
00:58:54,666 --> 00:59:00,008
Son of a bitch who is in
command. We have questions.

380
00:59:00,009 --> 00:59:05,809
About this club illegal.

381
00:59:12,134 --> 00:59:22,084
I know it's not on the agenda
... Imadiat talk to you.

382
00:59:22,361 --> 00:59:26,270
McCan watching it. All goes smoothly.

383
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:33,350
I know that is a friend McCan of
yours, but what business has he with us?

384
00:59:33,351 --> 00:59:36,730
This is a chance to catch
those who killed Greg Harris.

385
00:59:36,731 --> 00:59:46,681
Authorities have found new evidence in this case.
- What are you talking about? Everything is here!

386
00:59:46,843 --> 00:59:50,874
Everyone in this room I
know that they were killed.

387
00:59:50,875 --> 00:59:54,253
Everyone knows that McCan will be next.

388
00:59:54,254 --> 00:59:56,138
Enough.
- We must do something.

389
00:59:56,139 --> 01:00:01,960
You could take action.
- Yes, but that means all the committee.

390
01:00:01,961 --> 01:00:08,161
You do not have to wait.

391
01:00:18,952 --> 01:00:21,198
Spike.
- It was a trap.

392
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:25,028
I sent away. He knew that would happen.

393
01:00:25,029 --> 01:00:29,163
Listen to me.
- It's much bigger than you think.

394
01:00:29,164 --> 01:00:34,269
Office a lot of questions.
There are reputations to defend.

395
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:37,127
Do not do this to appear reputation ...

396
01:00:37,128 --> 01:00:44,498
I can not withdraw. I can not.
- Realize that they will deny everything?

397
01:00:44,499 --> 01:00:47,418
Only you know that depsre
and orders come to you.

398
01:00:47,419 --> 01:00:48,245
And?

399
01:00:48,246 --> 01:00:52,739
If something happens,
answer for everything.

400
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:54,530
For all?

401
01:00:54,531 --> 01:01:00,401
I'm done with this commission.

402
01:01:00,402 --> 01:01:04,545
You'll find them.

403
01:01:04,546 --> 01:01:08,454
It should work. Do not worry.

404
01:01:08,455 --> 01:01:18,405
He knows that we forced?
- Yes, yes, yes.

405
01:01:28,806 --> 01:01:32,462
Tell your folks, that they send my love.

406
01:01:32,463 --> 01:01:40,663
Danny?
- It's your first mission?

407
01:01:43,487 --> 01:01:47,766
In my first I was a moron teeming.
- I'll be good at it.

408
01:01:47,767 --> 01:01:50,177
To kill is easy.

409
01:01:50,178 --> 01:02:00,128
Killing is easy, the
hard part is to win.

410
01:02:00,278 --> 01:02:08,184
If I see you posting.
- Free to spread.

411
01:02:08,185 --> 01:02:12,385
I'll be careful.

412
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:18,732
We arrived.

413
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:22,540
A delayed.

414
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:34,090
Stay at 10-15 m distance
and let my workspace.

415
01:03:16,214 --> 01:03:21,124
Where you got your license?

416
01:03:21,125 --> 01:03:28,125
It's behind me. Go with 60.

417
01:03:30,277 --> 01:03:36,566
You have eye contact
with Danny in a minute.

418
01:03:36,567 --> 01:03:42,389
Stay with him Jake.
- Yes.

419
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:47,405
Target entered.
- Get behind him.

420
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:51,434
Enter. - I
place. -Push him.

421
01:03:51,435 --> 01:04:01,385
What are you doing? - Do not
miss. - I work from behind.

422
01:04:01,498 --> 01:04:07,639
Davis will give you data.

423
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:10,440
400 meters.

424
01:04:13,426 --> 01:04:19,056
All right. Tell me away.

425
01:04:19,057 --> 01:04:21,857
300 meters.

426
01:04:26,602 --> 01:04:29,402
200 meters.

427
01:04:32,992 --> 01:04:34,392
Vine.

428
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:38,110
100 meters.

429
01:04:46,898 --> 01:04:48,098
Now!

430
01:04:50,667 --> 01:04:54,667
Braking. Braking.

431
01:05:03,091 --> 01:05:05,296
We got him!

432
01:05:05,297 --> 01:05:10,297
He's dead. E Elvis.

433
01:05:17,052 --> 01:05:20,884
You got it.
- Stop the car.

434
01:05:20,885 --> 01:05:28,285
We must be sure that he died.

435
01:05:38,875 --> 01:05:42,783
Bring it to me.

436
01:05:42,784 --> 01:05:47,056
Have you been, man.

437
01:05:47,057 --> 01:05:52,094
Too easy.
- Davis, tell me something new.

438
01:05:52,095 --> 01:05:55,495
Comes quickly.

439
01:05:55,675 --> 01:06:02,538
Jump to the left.
- Continue to go.

440
01:06:02,539 --> 01:06:04,939
Come pal.

441
01:06:08,987 --> 01:06:13,832
Davis, where are you?
- We've got motherfuckers.

442
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:17,833
Damn.
- Let go!

443
01:06:20,721 --> 01:06:22,121
Vine.

444
01:06:25,904 --> 01:06:28,555
Out of the car!

445
01:06:28,556 --> 01:06:33,085
How the hell you appear? -
Easy. - Stay away from the car!

446
01:06:33,086 --> 01:06:34,886
Slowly.

447
01:06:37,505 --> 01:06:41,105
No, no, no ...

448
01:07:08,883 --> 01:07:10,994
It has no papers.

449
01:07:10,995 --> 01:07:14,917
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

450
01:07:14,918 --> 01:07:18,696
Who the hell is?

451
01:07:18,697 --> 01:07:23,570
That should not happen.
- Easy, Danny.

452
01:07:23,571 --> 01:07:33,521
Easy? I had to go out
there without problems.

453
01:07:51,652 --> 01:07:53,052
Damn.

454
01:07:53,709 --> 01:07:58,363
Who are these bastards?
- I do not know but its looking man.

455
01:07:58,364 --> 01:08:03,261
There are legal.
- Call this number.

456
01:08:03,262 --> 01:08:13,212
You said that we need a
group of cleaning, urgently.

457
01:08:13,975 --> 01:08:19,775
This.
- Yes. I'm done.

458
01:08:32,668 --> 01:08:39,868
To be safe.
- And you Davis.

459
01:08:43,964 --> 01:08:51,364
Sergeant, still seek him on ...

460
01:09:17,979 --> 01:09:22,257
Thank you. If there's something else ...
- Room service.

461
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:26,258
Something exotic.

462
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:49,961
Yes.
- I've found.

463
01:09:49,962 --> 01:09:51,710
Are you sure it's him?

464
01:09:51,711 --> 01:09:55,511
Yes, I'm sure.

465
01:10:27,716 --> 01:10:32,916
Ridcate. Coated. Move!

466
01:10:32,970 --> 01:10:36,438
Stay put there, right?

467
01:10:36,439 --> 01:10:42,744
It comes with McCan. And
Canela. Where is the bastard?

468
01:10:42,745 --> 01:10:46,972
I never heard of him.

469
01:10:46,973 --> 01:10:50,973
So it would be.

470
01:10:51,719 --> 01:10:55,041
Yes, Spike. I have.

471
01:10:55,042 --> 01:11:00,070
I have.
- Well done.

472
01:11:00,071 --> 01:11:07,747
I can not wait to meet him miserable.

473
01:11:07,748 --> 01:11:10,489
Spike going to cut your penis and stick
it to your mouth. Did you know that?

474
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:12,413
I like sounds.
- Yes? - Yes!

475
01:11:12,414 --> 01:11:16,414
Get in the van.

476
01:11:23,592 --> 01:11:28,392
Would we put. Come!

477
01:11:32,268 --> 01:11:37,868
There you are, asshole.

478
01:11:45,433 --> 01:11:46,833
Stay!

479
01:12:06,384 --> 01:12:07,784
Boss?

480
01:12:13,599 --> 01:12:18,808
What can I do that?
- Had this number.

481
01:12:18,809 --> 01:12:22,769
A phone number. Very well.

482
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:27,437
This was our chance to catch on these.

483
01:12:27,438 --> 01:12:32,653
Also mark it and watch
this phone number.

484
01:12:32,654 --> 01:12:36,254
Fucking idiots.

485
01:12:51,269 --> 01:12:53,307
Drop the gun.

486
01:12:53,308 --> 01:12:55,216
With his left hand.

487
01:12:55,217 --> 01:12:58,617
On the floor.

488
01:13:04,452 --> 01:13:09,452
Push it to my foot.

489
01:13:09,643 --> 01:13:13,029
I had to bring it to you. Where is it?

490
01:13:13,030 --> 01:13:14,834
Not liked.

491
01:13:14,835 --> 01:13:19,926
You've killed.
- Truck. Managed to escape.

492
01:13:19,927 --> 01:13:23,758
He was lucky. I was
going to kill him slowly.

493
01:13:23,759 --> 01:13:30,328
He was my friend?
- Yes? McCan and mine.

494
01:13:30,329 --> 01:13:39,657
Davis, Greg, Harriss ...
too many names on that list.

495
01:13:39,658 --> 01:13:45,058
Not to add yours. In.

496
01:13:46,932 --> 01:13:51,153
Who are you?
- It does not matter.

497
01:13:51,154 --> 01:13:54,497
For you, there is.
- What does that mean?

498
01:13:54,498 --> 01:13:59,698
I'm done.
- Do you?

499
01:14:00,379 --> 01:14:06,783
Without uniform, war,
particularly ... It's my duty.

500
01:14:06,784 --> 01:14:12,426
- No one knows what to do with you.
- Wrong. I know the name but not me.

501
01:14:12,427 --> 01:14:15,424
You have no idea who mess.

502
01:14:15,425 --> 01:14:20,684
Yes? Do not mess with me.

503
01:14:20,685 --> 01:14:29,285
Do not put your name on that list.

504
01:14:33,838 --> 01:14:36,638
Recognition.

505
01:14:42,641 --> 01:14:49,094
Murderers were killed.
Now we can go home.

506
01:14:49,095 --> 01:14:58,495
You will receive money after the check.

507
01:14:58,645 --> 01:15:01,045
Bring it!

508
01:15:02,766 --> 01:15:05,366
Take care!

509
01:15:06,079 --> 01:15:08,508
What about you? Are you okay?
- Yes.

510
01:15:08,509 --> 01:15:11,685
What is planned.
- Exit.

511
01:15:11,686 --> 01:15:15,886
That sounds good.

512
01:15:18,137 --> 01:15:22,644
I'm sure you renegade.
How did you manage?

513
01:15:22,645 --> 01:15:25,225
Do not want to talk about it.
- Lasso it.

514
01:15:25,226 --> 01:15:27,992
Thanks, not me but for my children.

515
01:15:27,993 --> 01:15:30,691
I will not forget what you did for me.

516
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:34,097
Go out of business. I'm done with it.

517
01:15:34,098 --> 01:15:39,178
Without soldarisme. -
No this. - Okay, okay.

518
01:15:39,179 --> 01:15:43,884
Please. Are you finished?

519
01:15:43,885 --> 01:15:47,685
Yes, I'm done.

520
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:21,808
Able to call.

521
01:16:24,751 --> 01:16:27,039
Sorry about that.

522
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:34,040
You're sorry. You should be.

523
01:16:34,468 --> 01:16:38,395
So it was over? You come home?

524
01:16:38,396 --> 01:16:39,396
No.

525
01:16:42,216 --> 01:16:46,728
Are you ready to tell me everything?

526
01:16:46,729 --> 01:16:53,729
All I want to know.
- Okay.

527
01:16:54,747 --> 01:16:59,747
I just do not know.

528
01:17:03,597 --> 01:17:13,547
I missed you, Danny. I do
not care about the past now.

529
01:17:31,643 --> 01:17:35,859
Yes, Carl. That number. That was work.

530
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:42,098
It's a travel agent. Know
all donkeries in the world.

531
01:17:42,099 --> 01:17:43,699
Enter.

532
01:18:03,697 --> 01:18:08,497
Hello?
- Hi, Danny!

533
01:18:09,849 --> 01:18:12,378
How did you get this number?

534
01:18:12,379 --> 01:18:16,861
Please, Danny. Does not
sound to professional.

535
01:18:16,862 --> 01:18:23,845
What do you want?
- We have a problem with the mission.

536
01:18:23,846 --> 01:18:29,336
I'm done.
- You killed it who not. The left one.

537
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:34,792
And besides that, I want 10%.
- No. I did the right thing.

538
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:38,852
Tell that Sheikh. He
wants to talk to his son.

539
01:18:38,853 --> 01:18:48,803
Check your friend before
to do things hastily.

540
01:19:54,316 --> 01:20:01,273
What are you doing? Come to bed.

541
01:20:01,274 --> 01:20:05,419
Come with me. Paris.
- What?

542
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:11,745
I expect there to where
I come from London.

543
01:20:11,746 --> 01:20:16,122
We are in the middle of
the night ... They know you.

544
01:20:16,123 --> 01:20:23,123
How to know about me.
- Us.

545
01:20:54,284 --> 01:21:02,284
When will it end?
- Coming soon.

546
01:21:33,758 --> 01:21:38,512
Take care of it.
- Listen. Do not do this one alone.

547
01:21:38,513 --> 01:21:44,892
Not a one.
- To do this both.

548
01:21:44,893 --> 01:21:47,651
We have an agreement. Do you remember?

549
01:21:47,652 --> 01:21:50,231
No longer do that? Come on, man.

550
01:21:50,232 --> 01:21:53,672
You must know it safe. You only trust.

551
01:21:53,673 --> 01:21:58,673
Vrajeala. Both. Come!

552
01:21:58,875 --> 01:22:03,275
You'll be killed.

553
01:22:06,743 --> 01:22:09,313
Thanks for doing this.

554
01:22:09,314 --> 01:22:15,314
You gotta be kidding me.

555
01:23:05,231 --> 01:23:08,401
Do not give me the money
one put it between your eyes.

556
01:23:08,402 --> 01:23:14,662
Another soldier killed my brother.
- No, that was.

557
01:23:14,663 --> 01:23:19,085
Do you think it's a joke?
- This is the book published.

558
01:23:19,086 --> 01:23:22,523
All have served in the SAS.

559
01:23:22,524 --> 01:23:26,545
It has created an ambush
when he was killed.

560
01:23:26,546 --> 01:23:32,192
Harris did not killed Hussein.

561
01:23:32,193 --> 01:23:37,793
You told me it's him.

562
01:23:37,993 --> 01:23:45,477
You're so delicate.
- Gentle? I've killed a man.

563
01:23:45,478 --> 01:23:50,474
In the book you will see religion.

564
01:23:50,475 --> 01:24:00,275
And Dad ...
- I know what needs Tactual.

565
01:24:06,938 --> 01:24:16,888
Harris did not killed
Hussein. Yes, all of SAS e.

566
01:24:26,048 --> 01:24:32,864
Where peci? We have clients.
Oman pushes his book.

567
01:24:32,865 --> 01:24:37,047
It will make a press release Tuesday.

568
01:24:37,048 --> 01:24:37,483
Tuesday.

569
01:24:37,484 --> 01:24:42,311
I know that is in short
but I had no choice.

570
01:24:42,312 --> 01:24:49,170
I'll do this alone.
- Are you sure?

571
01:24:49,171 --> 01:24:52,971
I think it is.

572
01:25:01,398 --> 01:25:07,998
I knew that you find here.

573
01:25:19,816 --> 01:25:26,030
You look lonely.
- Are you a friend of Danny?

574
01:25:26,031 --> 01:25:28,760
Hunter.
- He said good things about me?

575
01:25:28,761 --> 01:25:32,753
What are you doing here?
- We take care of you.

576
01:25:32,754 --> 01:25:36,545
Had to be with him.
- That's right He did not want him.

577
01:25:36,546 --> 01:25:40,411
He wanted to take care of you.

578
01:25:40,412 --> 01:25:45,088
For what?
- For you.

579
01:25:45,089 --> 01:25:49,525
Do you think that's not coming
back. What happens after that?

580
01:25:49,526 --> 01:25:53,480
I have a wife. I know the look.

581
01:25:53,481 --> 01:25:56,971
We know of 10 years. Danny and I ...

582
01:25:56,972 --> 01:26:00,861
wife loves it, kids love it ...

583
01:26:00,862 --> 01:26:04,252
even the wild animals I like Danny.

584
01:26:04,253 --> 01:26:09,551
Yes. I know that will come after you.

585
01:26:09,552 --> 01:26:13,196
And when it does, you will steal.

586
01:26:13,197 --> 01:26:21,397
How do you know that's the plan?

587
01:26:23,566 --> 01:26:28,766
Querying a woman now.

588
01:26:35,283 --> 01:26:37,606
The guy's good. Very good.

589
01:26:37,607 --> 01:26:41,336
If you feel something, not
make the corner and will fight.

590
01:26:41,337 --> 01:26:44,937
It ends today.

591
01:27:20,927 --> 01:27:30,727
Boss. E at the entrance. I think he is.

592
01:27:31,995 --> 01:27:34,795
May be it.

593
01:27:50,208 --> 01:28:00,158
Climb the stairs.
- Stay firm. I'm not sure.

594
01:28:22,982 --> 01:28:29,175
I got it.
- Do not pull.

595
01:28:29,176 --> 01:28:31,776
Stay here.

596
01:28:46,711 --> 01:28:48,111
Damn.

597
01:28:50,579 --> 01:28:54,179
Face the wall.

598
01:28:55,994 --> 01:29:01,194
Be careful with that.

599
01:29:38,263 --> 01:29:46,463
I've found. Heading for the roof.

600
01:30:07,078 --> 01:30:12,278
Heading for the roof.

601
01:30:38,838 --> 01:30:41,638
Jump, jump!

602
01:31:12,495 --> 01:31:18,295
E in motion. Let's go!

603
01:32:01,565 --> 01:32:05,165
Do not do it.

604
01:32:07,117 --> 01:32:10,981
Do not see it, boss.

605
01:32:10,982 --> 01:32:14,582
He disappeared.

606
01:32:25,686 --> 01:32:30,086
Move and you die.

607
01:32:30,416 --> 01:32:35,616
Let's go, let's go.

608
01:32:57,681 --> 01:33:00,881
What's this?

609
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:10,008
This is for the room. This is for Crick.

610
01:33:10,009 --> 01:33:15,603
I just started. Give him the mask down.

611
01:33:15,604 --> 01:33:20,404
Wait you out, guys.

612
01:33:27,165 --> 01:33:31,125
Why is it still alive.
Why do not you kill him?

613
01:33:31,126 --> 01:33:34,806
Why ask me that? I thought
you are the good guys!

614
01:33:34,807 --> 01:33:39,554
Who are you? Who are you working?

615
01:33:39,555 --> 01:33:42,481
We have much in common.
- Seriously?

616
01:33:42,482 --> 01:33:48,570
Do you? You sit there connected
chair, gun in hand I here,

617
01:33:48,571 --> 01:33:54,002
and I'll tell you what
the hell is happening?

618
01:33:54,003 --> 01:33:58,818
What happened. You think it over?

619
01:33:58,819 --> 01:34:08,769
Will send someone else.
And you will kill them all.

620
01:34:11,897 --> 01:34:16,097
Pull the trigger.

621
01:34:16,122 --> 01:34:20,862
I stopped you, I stopped them.
- I wanted to kill him.

622
01:34:20,863 --> 01:34:26,496
But they will. If you put that on
Whose hands have all been completed.

623
01:34:26,497 --> 01:34:29,307
- Camera. Why?
- Evidence.

624
01:34:29,308 --> 01:34:32,362
Evidence that is dead.

625
01:34:32,363 --> 01:34:35,840
It is the only way you can save.

626
01:34:35,841 --> 01:34:41,580
If I let go, tell you
where you find them.

627
01:34:41,581 --> 01:34:44,181
All right.

628
01:34:44,296 --> 01:34:48,896
Leave. Sheikh Amir.

629
01:34:49,978 --> 01:34:52,315
We find in Oman.
- Why?

630
01:34:52,316 --> 01:35:00,316
War. I killed three of his sons.

631
01:35:04,215 --> 01:35:05,215
No.

632
01:35:13,649 --> 01:35:19,849
Because I am a good boy.

633
01:35:23,457 --> 01:35:25,857
Throw it.

634
01:35:31,288 --> 01:35:32,288
In.

635
01:35:39,487 --> 01:35:44,087
The side. In knee.

636
01:35:52,890 --> 01:36:00,463
You've burned.
- I do not know much about you. I care only for action.

637
01:36:00,464 --> 01:36:04,327
You never know what you fight.

638
01:36:04,328 --> 01:36:06,859
Or for whom.

639
01:36:06,860 --> 01:36:13,491
You will never see true true.

640
01:36:13,492 --> 01:36:16,193
You're the one who was a trap.

641
01:36:16,194 --> 01:36:20,675
He could not give out.

642
01:36:20,676 --> 01:36:24,628
Her Majesty's Government,
does not like secret societies.

643
01:36:24,629 --> 01:36:27,834
Especially when there are
agreement with our interests.

644
01:36:27,835 --> 01:36:32,725
You know how that desert
produce bitter oil?

645
01:36:32,726 --> 01:36:36,192
You know how the contract worth?
- 3 months of life.

646
01:36:36,193 --> 01:36:40,709
That's right That's right!

647
01:36:40,710 --> 01:36:43,183
We send murderers. He solves his job.

648
01:36:43,184 --> 01:36:48,327
And you need to sign
contracts, we consider Sheikh.

649
01:36:48,328 --> 01:36:51,105
Motherfucker, you're a ... ... patriot.

650
01:36:51,106 --> 01:36:54,906
Serve their country as
they did the three who died.

651
01:36:54,907 --> 01:36:58,907
As you do, too.

652
01:38:26,397 --> 01:38:28,099
Here it is!

653
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:32,434
Danny disappeared. But
one thing's for sure.

654
01:38:32,435 --> 01:38:34,367
Will come after her.

655
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:39,619
That comes through the door with $
6 million, and it will not be there.

656
01:38:39,620 --> 01:38:44,844
And who will take the 10%. I.

657
01:38:44,845 --> 01:38:46,245
Boss?

658
01:38:50,806 --> 01:38:54,806
Occupied by him.

659
01:40:08,601 --> 01:40:13,392
It was not personal. Just business.

660
01:40:13,393 --> 01:40:16,474
We've played on the fingers.

661
01:40:16,475 --> 01:40:25,784
Vreasa not know why, that can kill you.

662
01:40:25,785 --> 01:40:30,185
The game is over.

663
01:40:40,495 --> 01:40:48,461
If you follow them, you'll
find. Anyone can be found.

664
01:40:48,462 --> 01:40:50,862
Even you.

665
01:41:03,472 --> 01:41:08,295
Are you here to finish this
for all. Do you understand?

666
01:41:08,296 --> 01:41:09,308
That's why I'm here.

667
01:41:09,309 --> 01:41:14,711
But you?
- Maybe it was over, kid.

668
01:41:14,712 --> 01:41:17,898
Who says? - I. Do not we
risk no. - Let's face it.

669
01:41:17,899 --> 01:41:22,163
Really?
- You entered a trap last night. Do you think that let you do it again?

670
01:41:22,164 --> 01:41:27,577
I told her to go back to
it. Want to seem false?

671
01:41:27,578 --> 01:41:34,275
You have to watch from a distance.
- It's nice.

672
01:41:34,276 --> 01:41:38,072
Do not know, right?
- I.

673
01:41:38,073 --> 01:41:42,562
It will be difficult. Life is
a shit with chocolate on top.

674
01:41:42,563 --> 01:41:46,095
What does this mean?
- Talk about good times and bad ...

675
01:41:46,096 --> 01:41:49,524
It seems that it has
changed life in both.

676
01:41:49,525 --> 01:41:51,708
Let's finish this.

677
01:41:51,709 --> 01:41:56,066
I'll cover the top. If something
goes wrong, come to you.

678
01:41:56,067 --> 01:41:59,406
Sheikh wants to end it. Let's get the pictures.
- Yes?

679
01:41:59,407 --> 01:42:03,912
Do not be a problem.
- From your mouth to the ears of the Lord.

680
01:42:03,913 --> 01:42:11,113
Do not move until I say yes?

681
01:42:26,365 --> 01:42:31,378
Who are you? What do you want?

682
01:42:31,379 --> 01:42:34,179
The photos.

683
01:42:36,132 --> 01:42:45,132
I would like to see things completed.

684
01:42:50,173 --> 01:42:57,494
Take these my people.
Show them what I did.

685
01:42:57,495 --> 01:43:05,295
I have a message for the sheik.

686
01:43:05,688 --> 01:43:10,088
It's still alive.

687
01:43:10,984 --> 01:43:13,584
Are false.

688
01:43:16,023 --> 01:43:19,623
A little hurt.

689
01:43:32,607 --> 01:43:36,407
I do not care.

690
01:43:36,723 --> 01:43:46,673
What can I do ... forgotten
by God in the desert?

691
01:43:48,445 --> 01:43:55,845
Do not you forgotten something?

692
01:44:06,475 --> 01:44:09,536
Wait. Stay there.

693
01:44:09,537 --> 01:44:14,137
Something is wrong.

694
01:44:18,695 --> 01:44:22,895
See that?
- Yes.

695
01:44:27,216 --> 01:44:33,816
We are in the wrong place.

696
01:45:30,635 --> 01:45:36,635
Relax. I killed the car.

697
01:46:15,823 --> 01:46:18,423
You again.

698
01:46:24,661 --> 01:46:31,299
At the palace. What happened there?

699
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:34,260
Expect a message from you.

700
01:46:34,261 --> 01:46:35,952
I was the messenger.

701
01:46:35,953 --> 01:46:39,220
And?
- What do you think?

702
01:46:39,221 --> 01:46:45,130
He's dead. I do not care. It
will not return to the desert.

703
01:46:45,131 --> 01:46:47,300
It was all for nothing.

704
01:46:47,301 --> 01:46:51,101
It's not fair.

705
01:47:00,895 --> 01:47:03,939
And the winner is ...

706
01:47:03,940 --> 01:47:06,336
That's what it is.
- Yes.

707
01:47:06,337 --> 01:47:12,337
Do not understand, right?

708
01:47:13,453 --> 01:47:16,853
Are you sure?

709
01:47:19,934 --> 01:47:23,382
You have to cover my expenses.

710
01:47:23,383 --> 01:47:26,636
You can not return to England.
Not after you've killed the sheik.

711
01:47:26,637 --> 01:47:30,061
Who the hell are you?
- I? A voice of experience.

712
01:47:30,062 --> 01:47:33,439
Where will we go? What will
you do? You'll need these.

713
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:36,452
New name. New girl. Acts in November.

714
01:47:36,453 --> 01:47:39,453
You'll see.

715
01:47:52,907 --> 01:47:58,398
You think you can escape?
- No one escapes.

716
01:47:58,399 --> 01:48:00,399
No one.

717
01:48:01,922 --> 01:48:08,139
The old man whom you killed. Not
that particular part in the war.

718
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:11,188
I tell you now. It is over for me.
- Seriously?

719
01:48:11,189 --> 01:48:14,354
I wish I could say the same and
that I would live happily ever after.

720
01:48:14,355 --> 01:48:19,240
It's your choice.
- I still say that the war I was finished. They say that eating shit.

721
01:48:19,241 --> 01:48:21,173
And I tell you too.

722
01:48:21,174 --> 01:48:23,574
Lasso it.

723
01:48:29,374 --> 01:48:31,447
Where are you going?

724
01:48:31,448 --> 01:48:37,140
I plan to visit?
- You never know.

725
01:48:37,141 --> 01:48:43,341
If you, I'll be waiting.

726
01:48:46,608 --> 01:48:55,408
We will call a taxi to the airport.

727
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:21,010
You are Danny, the boy who ran away?
- Yes.

728
01:49:21,011 --> 01:49:22,987
I returned.

729
01:49:22,988 --> 01:49:27,596
Where are you going?
- I do not know.

730
01:49:27,597 --> 01:49:29,426
Neither do I.

731
01:49:29,427 --> 01:49:30,613
We can go together?

732
01:49:30,614 --> 01:49:36,392
