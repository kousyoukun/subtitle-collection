1
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:02,561
伊朗革命引发石油危机

2
00:01:02,705 --> 00:01:06,561
经济陷入一片混乱

3
00:01:06,705 --> 00:01:08,709
能够掌握能源

4
00:01:08,843 --> 00:01:12,104
就能控制全世界

5
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:16,909
因此许多暗杀计划蠢蠢欲动

6
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,487
小子，你搞什么？
HUNTER: Hey, kiddo, what are you doing?

7
00:01:27,976 --> 00:01:30,824
拿我买的美味墨西哥餐喂狗
I buy you a fancy Mexican meal and you're feeding it to a mutt.

8
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:32,685
哪里美味！
Real fancy.

9
00:01:34,123 --> 00:01:35,754
你知道那是什么吗？
You have any idea what that is?

10
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:36,770
什么？
What?

11
00:01:36,905 --> 00:01:37,960
树鸡
Tree chicken.

12
00:01:38,094 --> 00:01:40,098
- 那是什么？ - 墨西哥圣品
What? That's what the locals call it.

13
00:01:40,971 --> 00:01:42,860
能治感冒宿醉
Colds, headaches, hangovers, cures anything.

14
00:01:42,985 --> 00:01:46,879
还可治百病，据说成份是蜥蜴
Iguana. That's what they say.

15
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,682
那消化不良呢？
What about indigestion?

16
00:01:49,516 --> 00:01:52,134
就吃蜥蜴饼
Fuckin' iguana taco.

17
00:01:54,704 --> 00:01:56,392
你在萨尔瓦多吃过了
Yeah, well, you had it in Salvador.

18
00:01:56,527 --> 00:01:58,243
对，难吃死了
Yeah, and that was shit.

19
00:01:58,857 --> 00:02:00,833
安哥拉呢？那里的菜好吃吧？
What about Angola? The food was good there, right?

20
00:02:00,977 --> 00:02:02,022
难吃
Shit.

21
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:03,681
那罗德西亚呢？
Yeah, Rhodesia?

22
00:02:03,825 --> 00:02:04,237
难吃
Shit.

23
00:02:04,362 --> 00:02:06,223
- 汉堡呢？ - 也难吃
Hamburg? Shit.

24
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,556
所以只要离开纽约
So if it's not New York, it's...

25
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,119
东西就变难吃
You got it. Shit.

26
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:11,114
你真是暴殄天物
Look at you wasting away.

27
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,128
我们该回纽约混饭吃
We got to get a job in New York.

28
00:02:13,262 --> 00:02:15,631
这很简单，那里多半是废物
That won't be a problem. Plenty of assholes there.

29
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:19,198
该走了，小子
Time to move, kiddo.

30
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:24,032
墨西哥，乔伊达市

31
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,927
好啦、好啦
MEIER: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:43,754
靠！
Fuck!

33
00:04:53,105 --> 00:04:53,997
趴下！
Stay down!

34
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:02,082
找掩护，小子！
HUNTER: Stay down, kid.

35
00:05:19,977 --> 00:05:20,610
为何愣住！
What happened?

36
00:05:20,745 --> 00:05:21,895
- 车里有小孩 - 什么？
There was a kid in the car.What?

37
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:22,826
车里有小孩！
There was a kid in the car.

38
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,909
快、快、快
Go, go, go, go!

39
00:05:24,044 --> 00:05:24,974
靠！
Fuck!

40
00:05:38,602 --> 00:05:42,016
受够了，我要退出
I'm done with this. I'm finished.

41
00:05:44,337 --> 00:05:46,159
没办法
I can't do this anymore.

42
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,465
我下不了手
I can't do this.

43
00:05:52,748 --> 00:05:58,914
特种精英

44
00:06:00,554 --> 00:06:04,352
真实故事，剽悍改编

45
00:06:05,676 --> 00:06:10,346
一年后，澳洲  亚拉河谷

46
00:06:51,595 --> 00:06:52,966
该死！
Oh, shit!

47
00:07:03,592 --> 00:07:04,839
该死！
Shit!

48
00:07:08,876 --> 00:07:12,454
两天后，阿拉伯- 阿曼

49
00:07:25,516 --> 00:07:26,878
丹尼上车
AGENT: Danny, get in.

50
00:07:26,878 --> 00:07:29,745
这里的人一堆怪病  我不想下车
These camel jockeys have got diseases I don't wanna think about.

51
00:07:29,745 --> 00:07:30,685
他人呢？
Where is he?

52
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:31,970
还在客户手上
The client still has him.

53
00:07:32,104 --> 00:07:33,284
什么客户？
What client?

54
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,336
我们现在就过去
We're going there now.

55
00:07:36,717 --> 00:07:38,175
快点走吧！
Okay, drive.

56
00:07:44,428 --> 00:07:47,075
客户是一位石油酋长
AGENT: So the client's an oil sheikh, no less.

57
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:50,729
过去曾掌管一大片沙漠
He used to rule some huge stretch of desert till his tribe kicked him out.

58
00:07:50,863 --> 00:07:53,165
之后就搬到这里
Been living here in exile ever since.

59
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,905
总之，酋长花钱要找人办事
Anyway, Sheikhy was loaded and he wanted a job done.

60
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,341
杭特拿了钱，人却落跑
Hunter took the contract, then he ran.

61
00:07:59,466 --> 00:08:01,355
他们在机场逮到他
They caught him at the airport.

62
00:08:02,544 --> 00:08:03,465
然后呢？
And?

63
00:08:03,887 --> 00:08:06,783
如你所见，全写在信里
You know the rest. You got the package.

64
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:10,639
我看到了，什么任务？
Yeah, I got it.

65
00:08:10,763 --> 00:08:14,187
只知道价钱，杭特没提太多细节
What's the job? Just came with a price tag, no details. Hunter took it cold.

66
00:08:14,187 --> 00:08:15,530
为何不说？
Why would he do that?

67
00:08:15,664 --> 00:08:19,107
付了六百万美金，是个大数目
Six million dollars. A big score, Danny.

68
00:08:19,241 --> 00:08:20,776
对杭特来说太多了
Too bloody big for Hunter.

69
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,981
是啊，他不值这么多
Yeah. Why'd you offer it to him?

70
00:08:23,116 --> 00:08:27,077
他需要钱，你则想退出，记得吗？
He wanted the money. And you were out, remember?

71
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:28,611
现在还是
Yeah. Still am.

72
00:08:30,414 --> 00:08:31,431
我拒绝拿枪
I'm done with killing.

73
00:08:31,565 --> 00:08:33,934
这可由不得你
Yeah, well, maybe killing ain't done with you.

74
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:36,974
杭特需要你，那个带种的铁汉丹尼
Hunter needs the old Danny, the best in the biz.

75
00:08:37,098 --> 00:08:38,374
如此响当当的称号！
The one with balls of steel. You remember him, right?

76
00:08:38,508 --> 00:08:42,325
奉劝你，尽早回到现实…
Look, it comes down to this.

77
00:08:42,412 --> 00:08:46,209
你不出手，杭特就死定了
You don't do this job, Hunter's a dead man.

78
00:08:52,587 --> 00:08:54,179
他们正在等你
They're waiting for you.

79
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,121
往这边
This way.

80
00:09:42,735 --> 00:09:44,970
他只是在等眼睛适应
SHEIKH AMR: He's waiting for his eyes to adjust.

81
00:09:46,312 --> 00:09:48,652
小心留意
Be careful around this one, boy.

82
00:09:52,076 --> 00:09:55,040
我儿子离开沙漠太久
My son forgets the ways of the desert.

83
00:09:55,184 --> 00:09:57,255
战争后
Since our war against the Sultan, all he has had of his homeland

84
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:02,127
他已无法嗅出野狠的味道
is this paint. Plaster.

85
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:07,689
我大儿子胡笙就在这里遇害
My first son, Hussain, was slaughtered here.

86
00:10:12,206 --> 00:10:14,144
死在他儿子面前
Shot before his children.

87
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,663
还有这里，那场米尔白战役
And here, at the Battle of Mirbat,

88
00:10:17,807 --> 00:10:23,504
二儿子萨林负伤后身亡
his brother, Salim, was wounded and then killed. Murdered.

89
00:10:26,765 --> 00:10:31,109
后来我第三个儿子阿里
And then my third son was taken from me. Ali.

90
00:10:34,888 --> 00:10:37,343
也被追杀致死
Hunted down and slaughtered.

91
00:10:39,376 --> 00:10:41,793
沙漠中有定律，灵魂要得到救赎
The law of the desert says the blood of the victim

92
00:10:41,937 --> 00:10:44,967
必须杀了凶手的血来祭拜
must be washed away by the blood of the Killers.

93
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,924
但我隐忍报复
But I refused revenge

94
00:10:47,048 --> 00:10:50,021
带着小儿子巴海逃避战火
and saved my last son, Bakhait, from the war.

95
00:10:50,156 --> 00:10:52,908
因此被部落逐出沙漠
So I was exiled to this desert.

96
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:57,703
我再有财有势
I have wealth, power.

97
00:10:57,838 --> 00:10:59,909
也终将一死
But rich men die, too.

98
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:01,894
等我死后
When I die,

99
00:11:02,383 --> 00:11:05,165
我希望巴海能回到部落
I want Bakhait to go home to my tribe.

100
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,181
不过在这之前
But for that to happen,

101
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:09,250
杀死我儿子们的凶手得先死
the killers of my sons must be killed.

102
00:11:10,123 --> 00:11:12,329
这不需要我们动手
You don't need me or Hunter for this.

103
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,017
你有足够人手
You got all the men you need.

104
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,577
我的人无法入境英国！
What use would my men be in England?

105
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:18,821
英国？
England?

106
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:23,041
英国人派出精锐部队
The English sent their fiercest

107
00:11:23,175 --> 00:11:25,189
展开石油杀戮战
dogs to kill for the Sultan's oil.

108
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:27,405
航空特种军团？
The SAS?

109
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:31,270
对，他们是最具侵略性的战士
Yes. Their glorious special forces.

110
00:11:31,404 --> 00:11:32,133
你儿子光荣战死

111
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:33,763
那不是战争，是掠夺
It was a war. It was not England's war.

112
00:11:33,898 --> 00:11:36,717
他们入侵阿拉伯，谋杀我儿子
They came to my land, murdered my sons,

113
00:11:36,842 --> 00:11:39,182
现在他们要接受制裁
now they will face my law.

114
00:11:40,304 --> 00:11:43,402
医生说我只剩六个月可活
The doctors say I have six months left to live.

115
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,953
你要在我死之前完成报仇
You must avenge my sons before I die

116
00:11:46,097 --> 00:11:48,197
不然你朋友就会跟我一起死
or your friend will die with me.

117
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:50,374
我不在乎你怎么杀他们
I don't care how you kill the Killers.

118
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:53,097
但他们要在镜头前承认罪行
But they will admit their guilt on tape,

119
00:11:53,232 --> 00:11:56,646
他们的死要像意外
and their deaths must look like accidents.

120
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,533
完全与巴海无关
This must not lead back to my son.

121
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:02,726
去吧！让英国佬明白
So go, show the English

122
00:12:02,861 --> 00:12:07,119
战争必须双方同意才能终止
a war isn't over till both sides say it is.

123
00:12:07,886 --> 00:12:09,574
我要见杭特
I wanna see Hunter.

124
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:30,433
丹尼，不…
Oh, Danny! No, Danny. No, no, no, no. No.

125
00:12:30,577 --> 00:12:32,811
你在这里干嘛？快走
What are you doing here? Get out of here.

126
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:36,523
你没事吧？
You all right?

127
00:12:36,648 --> 00:12:38,211
我没事？很好
Am I all right? Yeah, I'm all right.

128
00:12:38,345 --> 00:12:41,030
你快走，离开这里，快
You gotta go. Get away from here. Go, go, go, go.

129
00:12:41,165 --> 00:12:44,876
我不是为你来的，是替你家人而来
I'm not here for you anyway. I was thinking about the girls and Celine.

130
00:12:45,001 --> 00:12:46,861
我想也是
Me, too. Me, too.

131
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,508
这话什么意思？
(CHUCKLES) What's that supposed to mean?

132
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,232
养家活口很难的
It's tough putting food on the table.

133
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:55,426
你怎么说？六百万连问都不问？
What you feeding 'em? Six million, no questions?

134
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,164
这个嘛
Well.

135
00:12:56,298 --> 00:12:58,025
你早知道，那肯定是鸟差事
So you must've known that was a bullshit job.

136
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:01,477
我只知道，特勤队是一条不归路
Yeah, I knew. Fuckin' SAS, a one-way ticket for sure.

137
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,121
你接了差事，我不能把你扔在这
Well, you took the job, and I'm not leaving you here.

138
00:13:13,484 --> 00:13:15,172
拿点酒来！
Give this man a drink.

139
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:18,279
我很想你
I missed you.

140
00:13:18,414 --> 00:13:18,912
别想我！
I didn't miss you.

141
00:13:19,056 --> 00:13:21,866
退出这行是对的
Every day you were out of this game was a good day for me.

142
00:13:22,605 --> 00:13:24,389
我以你为荣
I was proud of you when you got out.

143
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:27,141
千万别再进来
Stay out.

144
00:13:27,275 --> 00:13:28,388
太迟了！
Too late.

145
00:13:30,028 --> 00:13:31,850
你该保持距离
You should have stayed away.

146
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:35,398
不然就跑快点
Or run faster.

147
00:14:28,778 --> 00:14:30,409
混帐东西
Son of a bitch!

148
00:14:31,243 --> 00:14:33,382
- 你干嘛？ - 我拿回我的表
What are you doing? Let me get my watch back.

149
00:15:00,072 --> 00:15:01,357
快！快！
Go, go!

150
00:15:14,764 --> 00:15:16,040
快！快开门
Go, go, get the door!

151
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:17,920
快开门！
Get the door!

152
00:15:28,872 --> 00:15:29,860
枪给我
Give me the gun.

153
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,061
表现太赞了！
Bravo! Bravo!

154
00:15:41,387 --> 00:15:44,351
若想中枪，我很乐意送你
If you need to be shot, I'll happily oblige.

155
00:15:48,551 --> 00:15:49,798
对不起，小子
I'm sorry, kiddo.

156
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:51,429
我父亲要留活口
My father needs him alive.

157
00:15:57,096 --> 00:15:58,314
有你的
Nice try.

158
00:15:58,439 --> 00:15:59,935
你知道你逃不了
You know they'd have found you.

159
00:16:04,874 --> 00:16:06,217
总会被找到
Everybody gets found.

160
00:16:10,734 --> 00:16:11,808
你早知道了！
You knew.

161
00:16:11,952 --> 00:16:14,983
你也知道杭特不愿意接任务
My gut tells me you knew the target and you knew Hunter wouldn't take it.

162
00:16:15,117 --> 00:16:16,229
用他当诱饵钧我
You used him as bait.

163
00:16:16,364 --> 00:16:17,294
这是误会！
That's a lot of angles, Danny.

164
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:20,267
丹尼，你以为我有那能耐？
Do you think I'm that smart?

165
00:16:21,322 --> 00:16:22,473
出去！
Get out.

166
00:16:24,074 --> 00:16:25,762
你也滚出去
And you. Out.

167
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,234
我怀念当年跟你共舞
ANNE: We missed you at the dance last night.

168
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:53,536
我不大会跳舞
DANNY: I'm not much of a dancer.

169
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,519
太久了，我脑海想不起这个片段
Besides, I'm still trying to find out how much house is under this.

170
00:16:56,653 --> 00:16:58,341
是啊，大忙人
Right, big plans.

171
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,489
是啊，真的忙过头
Yeah, maybe too big.

172
00:17:07,691 --> 00:17:09,418
你忘记我了，对吧？
You don't remember me, do you?

173
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:12,707
对，好一阵子没见
Yeah, well, it's been a while.

174
00:17:14,414 --> 00:17:16,073
我是安海蕾瑟
I'm Anne Frazer.

175
00:17:20,523 --> 00:17:22,019
安海蕾瑟？！
Anne Frazer?

176
00:17:22,154 --> 00:17:23,496
一头乱糟糟的红发
Anne had red hair full of grass.

177
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:24,868
对啊！
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

178
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,594
穿着一双怪红鞋
And weird red gumboots.

179
00:17:26,728 --> 00:17:29,452
还画上眼睛，我的天啊！
With eyes on them. (LAUGHS) Oh, my God!

180
00:17:36,971 --> 00:17:39,906
法国- 巴黎

181
00:17:46,696 --> 00:17:48,230
你欠我50英镑
Oi! You owe me 50 quid.

182
00:17:48,364 --> 00:17:49,956
我就说他会回来！
Told you he'd be back, didn't I?

183
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,764
我们很想你
We missed you. Yeah?

184
00:17:53,898 --> 00:17:57,245
是阿！所以我来了！
Here I am.

185
00:17:57,293 --> 00:17:59,364
好啦，要开始了吗？
DAVIES: All right, then, you want some?

186
00:18:03,853 --> 00:18:06,183
很好，完全没退步
Yeah, mate, you still got it. Still got that edge.

187
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:07,622
这才是真正的杀手！
You're a real killer.

188
00:18:12,302 --> 00:18:13,673
我们谈谈吧！
DANNY: Come on, let's talk. (GROANS)

189
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:17,864
你离开后没结婚吧？
DAVIES: While you were away, you didn't start a family, did you?

190
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:18,977
没
No.

191
00:18:19,111 --> 00:18:20,837
所以没人靠你养家活口？
So no one's depending on you?

192
00:18:20,972 --> 00:18:23,753
只有杭特
Only Hunter.

193
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,441
这样最好，因为…
'Cause one,

194
00:18:25,575 --> 00:18:27,551
你的对手是特种部队
you're going after the SAS.

195
00:18:27,695 --> 00:18:30,543
他们是一群疯子，彼此相互照应
They're a paranoid bunch. They always got their back up.

196
00:18:30,668 --> 00:18:32,672
再来，你要了解阿曼局势
Two, you need info on Oman.

197
00:18:32,816 --> 00:18:34,638
没有人敢谈阿曼政局
No one talks about Oman.

198
00:18:34,763 --> 00:18:35,913
许多人去当军事顾问
They went in there as advisors and ended up fighting the fucking war. Real hush-hush,

199
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:39,308
却打起仗来，成了半佣兵
semi-mercenary stuff.

200
00:18:39,433 --> 00:18:41,447
而且，你需要口供
Three, you need confessions.

201
00:18:41,581 --> 00:18:42,512
他们忍受折磨
They're trained to resist torture

202
00:18:42,636 --> 00:18:44,612
所以不管你说什么做什么
so no matter what you say or do, they'll say nothing.

203
00:18:44,746 --> 00:18:46,338
他们都三缄其口
And four, Danny,

204
00:18:46,473 --> 00:18:47,652
最后叮咛，丹尼
this is the best special forces regiment in the world.

205
00:18:47,786 --> 00:18:50,702
他们是最精英的特种部队 海豹特勤队根本不够看
They make the Navy Seals look like a bunch of cupcakes.

206
00:18:50,702 --> 00:18:52,256
更何况！
And not only that,

207
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:54,433
你一次想干掉三个怪胎
you're trying to take down three of their geezers

208
00:18:54,576 --> 00:18:56,360
还要搞成像一桩意外
and make it look like an accident.

209
00:18:56,494 --> 00:18:58,758
我只求你给我一点支援
All I'm asking is give it some thought.

210
00:18:59,247 --> 00:19:02,182
花一天或更多，反正我非做不可
Take a day, more if you want. I'm going anyway.

211
00:19:03,563 --> 00:19:04,675
我当然会帮忙，笨丹！
Of course I'm in, you silly bastard.

212
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:06,219
我们是好伙伴
It's what we do, right?

213
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,972
而且，我跟他们也有帐要清
Anyway, I've got a score to settle with them.

214
00:19:09,096 --> 00:19:10,525
我在巴拉斯参加过他们的测验
Tried out for them when I was in the Paras.

215
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:11,849
最后还是被刷掉
Did Hereford, the whole fucking lot.

216
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:14,313
什么？他们没要你？
MEIER: What, and they wouldn't have you?

217
00:19:15,244 --> 00:19:17,382
你想要我拿酒瓶塞你屁眼吗？
(SIGHS) You want this bottle shoved up your arse?

218
00:19:17,517 --> 00:19:19,454
你很气吗？要吃棒棒糖吗？
Are you upset? Would you like a lolly?

219
00:19:19,598 --> 00:19:20,039
我想吃
I'd love a lolly.

220
00:19:20,173 --> 00:19:21,545
要草莓还是操没！?
MEIER: Strawberry or fuck you?

221
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,022
麦尔
Meier.

222
00:19:23,981 --> 00:19:25,189
我要加入
In.

223
00:19:25,323 --> 00:19:26,340
为什么？
Why?

224
00:19:27,184 --> 00:19:28,670
六百万就是理由
Ah, six million reasons.

225
00:19:28,814 --> 00:19:30,473
怎么分帐？
So what's the split?

226
00:19:30,608 --> 00:19:34,309
经纪人抽佣后，你们五五分帐
After the Agent takes his slice, 50-50 between you two.

227
00:19:34,444 --> 00:19:36,544
五五分帐？那你呢？
50-50? How about you?

228
00:19:36,688 --> 00:19:37,733
我是为杭特淌浑水的
I'm in this for Hunter.

229
00:19:37,867 --> 00:19:39,239
真感人啊！
How wonderfully touching.

230
00:19:39,373 --> 00:19:41,512
感动阿！可是蠢毙了
Touching, but fuckin' stupid.

231
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,070
酋长只能认出一名凶手
The Sheikh could only ID one of the killers.

232
00:19:45,195 --> 00:19:47,400
要找出其他两个人的名字
I need you to come up with the names on the other two.

233
00:19:47,535 --> 00:19:49,702
从米尔巴战役那个开始
Start with the one they killed at Mirbat.

234
00:19:49,836 --> 00:19:52,800
当前的目标是史帝芬哈里斯
So the one target we do have is Steven Douglas Harris.

235
00:19:52,944 --> 00:19:54,468
他战后仍待在阿曼
Stayed on in Oman after the war.

236
00:19:54,603 --> 00:19:57,058
后来在苏丹军中开直升机
Ended up flying choppers for the Sultan's armed forces.

237
00:19:57,192 --> 00:19:58,688
太好了，这个简单
Great. A juice junkie.

238
00:19:58,832 --> 00:20:00,971
我和麦尔会去那里搞定他
Me and Meier'll head there to track him down.

239
00:20:01,095 --> 00:20:02,985
开工?！丹尼
Boys? Danny.

240
00:20:03,531 --> 00:20:04,960
麦尔
Meier.

241
00:20:08,394 --> 00:20:14,340
阿曼，首都- 马斯喀特

242
00:20:18,349 --> 00:20:20,199
搞什么，滚开！
MAN: What the fuck!

243
00:20:23,086 --> 00:20:24,036
滚开！

244
00:20:25,513 --> 00:20:26,826
是哈里斯！
MAN: Harris!

245
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:31,401
哈里斯，你这个混蛋！滚啦！
Harris, you prick! Fuck off!

246
00:20:36,906 --> 00:20:39,399
希望他们爱吃加砂的汉堡
Well, I hope the buggers like sand in their burgers, huh?

247
00:20:44,904 --> 00:20:47,973
白色吉普车往你那去，是哈里斯
White Range Rover coming your way. It's Harris.

248
00:21:10,089 --> 00:21:11,268
你干嘛？
SANDY: What are you doing?

249
00:21:13,743 --> 00:21:15,335
拜托，来一发嘛！
Come on, have a go. No.

250
00:21:15,469 --> 00:21:16,064
我不要
Come on. I'm not.

251
00:21:16,207 --> 00:21:17,282
来打一发嘛，瞄准然后射击
Have a go. Look.

252
00:21:17,282 --> 00:21:20,609
来！很好！
Just aim and shoot. Go! Here we go!

253
00:21:23,017 --> 00:21:24,235
你这个色胚！
Oh, you horny git! Come on.

254
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:27,610
来嘛！来嘛！
No. Come on. (LAUGHS) Come on.

255
00:22:21,643 --> 00:22:25,258
英国   航空特种军团

256
00:22:36,268 --> 00:22:37,927
女士们，赏条内裤当谢礼吧！
DAVIES: All right, ladies, you can throw your knickers if you want.

257
00:22:38,061 --> 00:22:40,095
无聊，你们这群笨蛋
Go on, you cheeky bugger!

258
00:22:41,322 --> 00:22:42,569
你在阿曼服役？
MAN: You serve in Oman? At Mirbat.

259
00:22:42,703 --> 00:22:45,283
在米尔巴，那段日子真爽
That was a day, wasn't it?

260
00:22:45,417 --> 00:22:47,460
米尔巴之役，是场混战
What about Mirbat? That was a right mess, eh?

261
00:22:47,594 --> 00:22:48,525
是不大好
Wasn't good.

262
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:50,308
友人战死
I had a mate there.

263
00:22:56,523 --> 00:22:59,688
英国   伦敦

264
00:22:59,822 --> 00:23:01,644
- 快接，快点！ - 好…
DIANE: Spike, get that quick. Yeah, all right, all right.

265
00:23:06,027 --> 00:23:06,794
爱哭─闹！
Bollocks.

266
00:23:07,696 --> 00:23:08,741
你好！
Hello?

267
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:09,806
史派基，我是巴萨
Spikey, it's Bazza.

268
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,709
电话再那么吵，我就砸了它！
God's sake! I'm unplugging that bloody thing next time, and I mean it.

269
00:23:14,284 --> 00:23:16,557
有个自称特种部队的人
Yeah, I'm onto this bloke here, right.

270
00:23:16,557 --> 00:23:20,230
在搜集米尔巴的消息
He was in the Bear earlier pumping some SAS lads for info on Mirbat.

271
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:21,381
米尔巴？然后呢？
Mirbat. And?

272
00:23:21,516 --> 00:23:23,750
他自称威尔斯人，不过口音不像
He says he's Welsh. But he don't sound it.

273
00:23:23,884 --> 00:23:25,793
我不知道，也许我太多虑
I don't know. Maybe I'm being a bit paranoid, but...

274
00:23:25,927 --> 00:23:29,677
多虑是好事，小心麻烦找上门
Hey, just 'cause you're being paranoid, doesn't mean to say they're not out to get you.

275
00:23:30,569 --> 00:23:33,830
说吧，你得到什么情报
All right, mate, give me what you've got.

276
00:23:33,964 --> 00:23:34,693
好
Okay.

277
00:23:34,827 --> 00:23:36,553
我会派一个人盯牢他
Put one of my Locals onto him.

278
00:24:04,682 --> 00:24:05,958
阿曼大使馆
SPIKE: The Omani Embassy.

279
00:24:06,092 --> 00:24:08,959
我们的人跟他进到签证处
Our Local followed him into the visa section.

280
00:24:09,391 --> 00:24:12,613
他说是威尔斯人，自称琼斯先生
Says he's Welsh, calls himself Mr. Jones.

281
00:24:12,748 --> 00:24:14,176
之后我们就跟丢他
We lost him after he left.

282
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:15,692
跟丢？怎么会？
FITZ: Lost him? How come?

283
00:24:15,816 --> 00:24:17,763
他没回去取车，那是赃车
He never came back to his car. Stolen.

284
00:24:17,898 --> 00:24:20,487
总之，他四天后飞去阿曼
Anyhow, he flies to Oman in four days.

285
00:24:20,621 --> 00:24:23,556
我想派人去那里盯他
I'd like permission to send one of my boys out there to tail him.

286
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,059
详细调查来历
This was definitely some kind of recce.

287
00:24:26,184 --> 00:24:29,348
那场仗很乱，我们的行动有待商确
That was a dirty war. What we did there was questionable.

288
00:24:29,483 --> 00:24:31,238
阿曼被捣的像蜂窝
Oman is a bloody hornet's nest.

289
00:24:31,372 --> 00:24:33,309
是啊，如果这家伙想下手
Right. And if this bugger is poking at it,

290
00:24:33,453 --> 00:24:34,633
我要知道他是谁
I want to know who he is. I say we send a Local.

291
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:37,347
我们派人跟，有人反对吗？
Any objections?

292
00:24:37,481 --> 00:24:38,277
注意
Noted.

293
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:39,687
我们让你挑选人手
We'll leave you to choose the right man.

294
00:24:39,821 --> 00:24:43,168
提醒一下，我们是前特种队员
I'd also like it noted that we are ex-SAS.

295
00:24:43,312 --> 00:24:45,163
我们要保护的人也是
The men we protect are ex-SAS.

296
00:24:45,288 --> 00:24:46,400
而你史派基
And you, Spike,

297
00:24:46,544 --> 00:24:49,325
虽然你不爽还是要承认
though you hate to admit it, are ex-SAS.

298
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,876
记住，我们现在是商人兼银行家
JUSTICE: Remember, we're businessmen and bankers now.

299
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:53,957
从前的作为，全是违法勾当
What we do here is illegal.

300
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,959
我们要不留痕迹
We can leave no trace of our activities.

301
00:24:57,103 --> 00:24:59,491
才够格被称为羽毛人
That's why we're called The Feather Men,

302
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:03,404
因为我们飘来飘去不染污泥
'cause our touch is light.

303
00:25:05,351 --> 00:25:06,694
史派基是高手
THE DON: Now, Spike's a good man.

304
00:25:06,828 --> 00:25:09,350
特种队失去他是一大损失
Day the SAS lost him, they lost a good soldier.

305
00:25:09,484 --> 00:25:12,131
不过他仍认为，他还在特种队
COMMANDER B: Yes, but the problem is he thinks he's still in the SAS.

306
00:25:12,266 --> 00:25:13,992
肮脏的差事总得有人做
Well, someone has to do the dirty work.

307
00:25:14,126 --> 00:25:15,910
我们没人想双手染血
None of us want blood on our pinstripes.

308
00:25:16,044 --> 00:25:18,950
听着，我对血没意见
Listen, I've got no problem with blood.

309
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,607
我担心的是墨水
What worries me is ink.

310
00:25:21,866 --> 00:25:24,234
确定他不会向媒体打小报告？
Make sure he keeps us out of the newspapers.

311
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:24,934
老板，你好！
MARTIN: What's doing, boss?

312
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:26,661
你的阿拉伯文很好吗？
Your Arabic's still good, right?

313
00:25:26,795 --> 00:25:27,332
挺不错
Good enough. You're going to Oman.

314
00:25:27,466 --> 00:25:30,535
你去阿曼，我要你去盯一个家伙
I've got a bloke I want you to tail out there.

315
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,822
算你走运！
You lucky bastard!

316
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,549
你真漂亮
You know what? You're gorgeous.

317
00:25:48,968 --> 00:25:50,080
你住哪里？
Where are you staying?

318
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,461
我住希尔顿
I'm staying at the Hilton.

319
00:25:51,596 --> 00:25:54,693
我也是，你住哪间房？
As a matter of fact, so am I. What room are you in?

320
00:25:54,828 --> 00:25:56,132
怎么？你想知道？
Why? Would you like to know?

321
00:25:56,266 --> 00:25:56,995
很想知道
Love to.

322
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,201
你真油嘴滑舌
AIR HOSTESS: You are smooth.

323
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:14,699
我们来这干嘛？
DAVIES: What are we doing out here, then, in the middle of nowhere?

324
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:17,279
他就像我们口袋中的小棋
MEIER: Well, I ask him to go hide it, he hides it.

325
00:26:17,423 --> 00:26:18,823
祝我们好运吧！
Could've been your asshole, consider yourself lucky.

326
00:26:18,957 --> 00:26:20,137
闭嘴，麦尔
Shut it, Meier.

327
00:26:20,655 --> 00:26:22,563
感激你，谢了
Appreciate it, thank you.

328
00:26:28,557 --> 00:26:30,974
这瓷砖跟浴室的一样吗？
These tiles are an exact match to the shower step?

329
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,777
百分之百
Hundred percent.

330
00:26:32,911 --> 00:26:34,791
哈里斯到回家
Harris comes home, parks the car. It's been a hard day.

331
00:26:34,925 --> 00:26:36,776
去冲个澡
I'll have a shower. Whoops.

332
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:39,461
糟糕，他踩到洗发精滑倒
He slips on the shampoo,

333
00:26:39,596 --> 00:26:40,900
后脑勺撞到浴室阶梯
hits the corner of the step with his occiput.

334
00:26:41,034 --> 00:26:42,598
- 全部搞定！ - 少来了
Case closed. Get out of it.

335
00:26:43,403 --> 00:26:47,623
何必大费周章！他搞上有夫之妇
You boys are going about this all wrong. That bird he's screwing is married.

336
00:26:48,045 --> 00:26:48,908
我们干脆轰了他们俩个
Why don't we just pop 'em both and

337
00:26:49,033 --> 00:26:50,347
让一切看来是她老公干的！
make it look like her husband did it.

338
00:26:50,471 --> 00:26:53,636
两个都杀，她做错什么？
Pop 'em both? What's she ever done?

339
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,746
我们只要哈里斯的命
It's Harris we're after.

340
00:26:56,552 --> 00:26:57,606
鲁莽的家伙
Poor bastard.

341
00:26:58,191 --> 00:27:01,030
他只不过是执行命令罢了
Ten years after the war, he cops it for doing something he was ordered to do.

342
00:27:01,165 --> 00:27:02,785
他加入俱乐部时就该明白
He knew what he was doing when he joined the club.

343
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,783
什么俱乐部？
Yeah, what club?

344
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:05,346
杀人俱乐部
The killing club.

345
00:27:06,286 --> 00:27:06,948
我们也将是
It could be you or me. Yeah, but it's not...

346
00:27:07,082 --> 00:27:10,084
我不是，我没杀过中东人
I'm just glad I never killed a raghead.

347
00:27:10,601 --> 00:27:11,915
开开玩笑，孩子
No offense, my son.

348
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,220
我们动手吧
Let's get this done.

349
00:27:13,354 --> 00:27:16,423
原谅我朋友，他是个超级混蛋
MEIER: Excuse my friend. He's a royal asshole.

350
00:27:25,515 --> 00:27:26,598
该死！
Shit!

351
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:36,227
他要跑去哪？这里是沙漠耶
DAVIES: Where's he gonna run? It's the middle of the fuckin' desert.

352
00:27:39,478 --> 00:27:40,562
该死！
Son of a...

353
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:48,618
麦尔
Meier,

354
00:27:48,742 --> 00:27:50,402
在下一个通道堵他
cut him off at the next shaft!

355
00:27:51,015 --> 00:27:51,917
快去！快！
Let's go, let's go.

356
00:27:57,959 --> 00:27:59,110
他人呢？
Where is he?

357
00:28:02,505 --> 00:28:03,493
嘘！
Shh.

358
00:28:39,246 --> 00:28:41,221
快离开这里！搞什么！
DAVIES: Let's get out here. Fuckin' hell!

359
00:28:47,177 --> 00:28:48,702
谁找我们麻烦？
MEIER: So what, now somebody's on our ass?

360
00:28:48,846 --> 00:28:49,958
我们马上离开这
DANNY: We should move right away.

361
00:28:50,092 --> 00:28:52,001
明天准备采访哈里斯
We'll set up Harris' interview for tomorrow.

362
00:28:52,135 --> 00:28:54,149
戴维斯，确保他的妞不会出现
Davies, you make sure his girl doesn't show.

363
00:28:54,283 --> 00:28:55,847
她是无辜的
She has nothing to do with this.

364
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:14,404
逊咖！
Wanker!

365
00:29:24,014 --> 00:29:26,728
假装要像一点，等等我提问
DANNY: We're military historians. I'll do the talking, all right?

366
00:29:27,783 --> 00:29:30,180
现在应该是五点，对吧？
Well, it's 5:00 somewhere, isn't it?

367
00:29:30,314 --> 00:29:32,616
那这段纪录片要在哪播？
So where's this documentary gonna be shown, then?

368
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,026
电视上？
On the telly?

369
00:29:39,118 --> 00:29:40,605
坐好！
The chair.

370
00:29:41,516 --> 00:29:44,000
哪个单位这么不知好歹！
Those bastards in C Company put this together. Hmm?

371
00:30:10,316 --> 00:30:10,786
搞什么鬼？
HARRIS: What's the matter?

372
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,934
吃到砂子的人叫你们来？
They didn't like sand in their burgers?

373
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:15,629
哈?，各位！我拒绝发言
Eh? Hello, boys. I'm not saying a word

374
00:30:15,754 --> 00:30:17,250
找我律师来！
till I see my lawyer.

375
00:30:17,384 --> 00:30:20,108
回想一下，库姆村
Think back. The village of Qum.

376
00:30:20,232 --> 00:30:22,841
你杀了一个部落领袖胡笙
You killed a guerilla commander.

377
00:30:22,841 --> 00:30:26,466
你承认吗？
His name was Hussain bin Amr. Do you admit it?

378
00:30:31,338 --> 00:30:34,282
混帐！你是在开玩笑吧？
Fuck off! You're kidding, right?

379
00:30:34,282 --> 00:30:36,258
你在那里指挥一群人
You commanded a company there.

380
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,861
我都指挥一大群人
Yeah, I led a company on that op, sure.

381
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,422
是啊，你暗杀了胡笙
And you assassinated Hussain bin Amr.

382
00:30:43,566 --> 00:30:45,254
现场有目击证人
There were witnesses.

383
00:30:45,992 --> 00:30:48,447
你在他家人面前毙了他
You dropped him in front of his family.

384
00:30:52,427 --> 00:30:55,592
好吧！你说对了，是我干的！
All right, you got me. I did it. Hmm?

385
00:30:55,727 --> 00:30:57,482
去你的！
Fuck you!

386
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,333
快把我放开吧!
Good one. Now untie me.

387
00:30:59,467 --> 00:31:00,877
起来!
Get up.

388
00:31:02,286 --> 00:31:03,456
滚开!
Hey! Piss off!

389
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,796
我们拿到我们要的了
We have what we need.

390
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:10,467
要是我说是别人毙了他的呢？
What if I told you somebody else dropped your guerilla commander?

391
00:31:11,752 --> 00:31:13,181
那是谁？
His name is...

392
00:31:13,325 --> 00:31:15,109
我记不得人
I can't remember.

393
00:31:15,531 --> 00:31:18,082
但他写了本跟阿曼任务有关的书
But he's writing a book about the whole Oman gig.

394
00:31:18,216 --> 00:31:19,875
你可能找的到
You might find it in there.

395
00:31:20,585 --> 00:31:22,532
如果你识字的话!
If you could read. (LAUGHS)

396
00:31:22,666 --> 00:31:24,258
带去浴室
To the bathroom.

397
00:31:24,488 --> 00:31:26,857
不…等等，等一下!
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

398
00:31:26,991 --> 00:31:29,063
我想起来了，看你惊恐的鸟脸
It's coming back to me, looking at your fucking face.

399
00:31:29,197 --> 00:31:31,269
他叫索尔
His name is Captain R. Sole! A-R-S-E H-O-L-E.

400
00:31:34,222 --> 00:31:35,335
闭嘴
Shut up.

401
00:31:35,469 --> 00:31:36,610
你死定了!
You're fucking dead, yeah?

402
00:31:37,071 --> 00:31:38,346
跪下!
On your knees.

403
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,032
一群怪咖!
Fucking queers! Serves you fucking right!

404
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:45,290
- 低头 - 脏手拿开，怪咖!
Head down. Get your fuckin' hands off me, you queer!

405
00:31:46,028 --> 00:31:46,978
别开玩笑!
You're fuckin' kidding me.

406
00:31:47,112 --> 00:31:47,496
抓住他
DANNY: Hold him still.

407
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:50,373
别让我逮到，我会把你淹死在马桶
If I find you, I'll put your fuckin' head in the toilet bowl.

408
00:31:50,507 --> 00:31:51,715
好了，受死吧!
Poor fucker.

409
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,639
杰伊！
Jay!

410
00:32:03,147 --> 00:32:07,453
我得搭计程车，轮胎爆了
I need money for the taxi. I had to take a taxi. I had a flat.

411
00:32:22,472 --> 00:32:23,881
去你的!
HARRIS: Fuck you! (SCREAMS)

412
00:32:33,069 --> 00:32:34,594
任务完成
Case closed.

413
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,424
谢谢你
Thank you.

414
00:32:50,121 --> 00:32:52,461
被击沉的船只
WOMAN OVER RADIO: ... tells of a dramatic 12-hour rescue operation

415
00:32:52,586 --> 00:32:55,175
目前正全力抢救中…
to save the crew of Radio Caroline.

416
00:32:55,242 --> 00:32:56,968
雷迪欧号沉没在…
The pirate radio ship sank the...

417
00:33:00,047 --> 00:33:02,790
你做不到的事，你朋友完成了
It seems your friend did what you couldn't.

418
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:06,156
是我不想做
Wouldn't.

419
00:33:06,444 --> 00:33:09,455
结果都一样，他帮我哥报仇
Wouldn't, couldn't. He's avenged Hussain.

420
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:11,555
这对你可不是好消息
Good news for the old man, not for you.

421
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:12,639
这话什么意思？
What do you mean?

422
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:15,593
三位兄长死去，在沙漠中腐烂
Three brothers dead. Rotting in the sand.

423
00:33:16,456 --> 00:33:18,911
你却不想自己报仇？
You didn't wanna get revenge yourself?

424
00:33:19,055 --> 00:33:21,539
只害怕弄脏自己的手？
Scared of getting your hands dirty?

425
00:33:21,865 --> 00:33:23,726
你最好快习惯
Better get used to it.

426
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,164
要回去的地方没有宫殿
No palace where you're going.

427
00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:27,332
只有帐棚和粪坑
A tent and a hole to shit in.

428
00:33:28,176 --> 00:33:31,206
这个梦魇，即将到来
He's your worst nightmare and he's gonna do it.

429
00:33:32,587 --> 00:33:35,177
那里荒凉，就像监牢
And when he does, you're out of here.

430
00:33:35,311 --> 00:33:36,682
等我发现你在沙漠
When I find you in that desert,

431
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:39,876
祈祷上帝让我枪法…
I pray God keeps my aim...

432
00:33:42,983 --> 00:33:44,518
准确
...true.

433
00:33:58,376 --> 00:33:59,325
你觉得呢？
Well, what do you think?

434
00:33:59,469 --> 00:34:01,090
是啊，快完成了
Yeah, it's coming along.

435
00:34:05,645 --> 00:34:07,851
你晚餐煮什么？
What are you doing for New Year's Eve dinner?

436
00:34:08,618 --> 00:34:10,114
该死
Oh, shit!

437
00:34:16,108 --> 00:34:17,413
糟了
DANNY: Bollocks!

438
00:34:20,175 --> 00:34:21,508
独居的陌生男子
Strangers are a bit of an

439
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,167
在这里很让人好奇
exotic thing around here.

440
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,740
拜托，这里我很熟
Oh, come on, I didn't think I was a stranger.

441
00:34:24,874 --> 00:34:26,984
你还是很神秘
I know, but you're still exotic.

442
00:34:27,118 --> 00:34:30,408
丹尼，我感觉你有事隐瞒
Danny, something tells me you've got a story to tell.

443
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,546
对
Yeah. Mmm.

444
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:46,596
你还等什么？派对开始了
Come on, what are you waiting for? Party's outside.

445
00:34:47,757 --> 00:34:49,406
新年快乐！
MAN: Happy New Year!

446
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,786
新年快乐！
Happy New Year!

447
00:34:56,263 --> 00:34:58,124
这是这里的传统
It's a tradition around here.

448
00:34:58,795 --> 00:35:00,071
新年快乐…
Happy New Year!

449
00:35:14,476 --> 00:35:18,254
英国  伦敦

450
00:35:23,078 --> 00:35:25,217
前特种员哈里斯，居家意外身亡

451
00:35:25,351 --> 00:35:26,569
该死！
Shit!

452
00:35:42,153 --> 00:35:45,539
你要的米尔巴战役资料
Mirbat. The artist's name is on the back.

453
00:35:45,673 --> 00:35:47,303
自己看着办
Have them talk to him.

454
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:52,492
还有，我的人在阿曼惹事
One more thing. My boys had some trouble in Oman.

455
00:35:52,521 --> 00:35:53,930
有人在追杀他们
Somebody was tailing them.

456
00:35:54,055 --> 00:35:56,395
我们得仔细调查一下
We'll have to have a look into that, won't we?

457
00:35:57,383 --> 00:35:58,850
是啊
Yeah.

458
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,244
你的画都如此逼真
Ah, that's how you get it so lifelike, then.

459
00:36:10,378 --> 00:36:11,174
什么？
Sorry?

460
00:36:11,308 --> 00:36:14,089
看着照片画，不算作弊吗？
Photos of the lads. Isn't that like cheating?

461
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:17,734
我精确地重现历史事件
I'm recreating an historical event. Accuracy is everything.

462
00:36:18,568 --> 00:36:20,841
那幅米尔巴之役，让我打冷颤
That Mirbat painting stopped me cold when I saw it.

463
00:36:20,975 --> 00:36:21,896
你也到过那里？
You were at Mirbat?

464
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:25,866
战友去过，我想你或许也认识
Had a mate there. I was hoping you might have an address for him.

465
00:36:25,866 --> 00:36:26,797
你是特种队员？
You're with the SAS?

466
00:36:26,921 --> 00:36:28,005
以前是
Was.

467
00:36:29,098 --> 00:36:31,371
要找他最好透过特种队
Then your best bet for an address would be Regimental Association...

468
00:36:31,496 --> 00:36:33,798
他们三缄其口
They won't talk to me.

469
00:36:33,932 --> 00:36:37,097
现在没有熟人在里面
Spent the last few years plying my trade overseas. Angola and that.

470
00:36:37,231 --> 00:36:39,427
所以私下来问你
I come to you unofficial like.

471
00:36:42,122 --> 00:36:45,699
等等，我或许有些资料
Well, I might have something somewhere.

472
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,243
给我几分钟吧
Just give me a few minutes.

473
00:36:47,368 --> 00:36:49,315
请便
Be my guest.

474
00:37:02,953 --> 00:37:05,187
有个家伙来打探米尔巴的事
I got a bullshitter askin' about Mirbat.

475
00:37:05,321 --> 00:37:07,115
说是队上的人
Yeah. He claims he's with the regiment.

476
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:09,359
听口气，感觉一点也不像自己人
No, there's no way he was SAS.

477
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,291
应该是来套话
Yeah, I can smell it off him. Ah, he's a bloody fake.

478
00:37:36,135 --> 00:37:38,696
我的线民电话被切断
My contact says the call was cut off,

479
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:42,475
不过知道米尔巴，肯定是自己人
but Gowling said that there was somebody there asking about Mirbat. It has to be our guy.

480
00:37:42,475 --> 00:37:44,364
你认为我们该怎么做？
And what would you have us do about it?

481
00:37:44,489 --> 00:37:45,802
尽快找到他，否则会再出人命
Find him.

482
00:37:45,802 --> 00:37:48,651
这应该跟米尔巴之役有关
If we don't, there's gonna be another murder and it will be one of our Mirbat boys.

483
00:37:48,651 --> 00:37:49,955
那他们会是谁？
Then who are they?

484
00:37:50,089 --> 00:37:51,748
他们是专家
Well, they're pros for sure.

485
00:37:51,883 --> 00:37:53,254
这些人敢找上特种队
If these guys are going after the SAS,

486
00:37:53,388 --> 00:37:55,556
一定是最顶尖的专业杀手
they're gonna be top-class professional assassins.

487
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,695
他们背后想必有人主使
They must have a string of hits behind them

488
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:00,073
不过无法浮上台面
but they're completely under the radar.

489
00:38:00,207 --> 00:38:01,636
我们只有阿曼这个线索
All we've got is Oman.

490
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:02,336
阿曼！
Oman?

491
00:38:02,471 --> 00:38:04,168
众所皆知，我们的人玩太过火
We all know our people went too far.

492
00:38:04,302 --> 00:38:06,853
阿曼、米尔巴，都该放下仇很
Oman, Mirbat. It all needs to be left alone.

493
00:38:06,988 --> 00:38:09,510
你去告诉那个威尔斯人吧！
You should try telling that to the Welshman.

494
00:38:10,287 --> 00:38:11,591
他说的对
He's right.

495
00:38:11,879 --> 00:38:14,948
找到这个假威尔斯人和他老板
We have to find this phony Welshman and his group.

496
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:17,892
军事档案指出
DAVIES: The file says an SAS officer

497
00:38:18,026 --> 00:38:20,453
一名军官在米尔巴杀了酋长之子
killed the Sheikh's son at the Battle of Mirbat.

498
00:38:21,325 --> 00:38:23,809
瓦魏克雷格，唯一在场的军官
Warrick Steven Cregg.

499
00:38:23,943 --> 00:38:25,737
杀了所有会动的东西
He was the only officer there that night. Killed everything that moved.

500
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:27,808
我们下个目标，是真正的高手
He's our worst nightmare. A real hotshot.

501
00:38:27,943 --> 00:38:29,026
这是他的画像
Paintings of him, the lot.

502
00:38:29,161 --> 00:38:30,369
这你哪弄来？
Where did you get this?

503
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,709
画家那里
The bloke who did the paintings.

504
00:38:33,802 --> 00:38:36,651
别担心，他已经被电线缠挂了
Don't you worry about that, all right? He's shuffled off this mortal coil.

505
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:37,763
这不在计划范围
That wasn't part of the deal.

506
00:38:37,897 --> 00:38:40,717
拜托，凡事总是会有意外
Come on, shit happens when you play in the deep end of the pool, Danny.

507
00:38:40,842 --> 00:38:43,076
为什么不能照计划来？
Why couldn't you two stick to the plan, huh?

508
00:38:45,263 --> 00:38:47,814
锁定克雷格，下一步怎么做？
You've been watching this Cregg, what's your next big idea?

509
00:38:47,948 --> 00:38:49,377
他老婆住院
His wife's in hospital.

510
00:38:49,511 --> 00:38:52,600
他没训练时会待在那里
When he's not training for the selection march, he spends most days there.

511
00:38:52,686 --> 00:38:54,144
我们何不在那里干掉他？
MEIER: So why don't we hit him there?

512
00:38:54,278 --> 00:38:54,748
不行
DANNY: No.

513
00:38:54,892 --> 00:38:56,234
不能在他家人附近
Not near his family.

514
00:38:56,359 --> 00:38:57,951
去打听训练的地点
Get me everything you know on that march.

515
00:38:58,095 --> 00:38:59,946
在那边下手
We'll see where that goes.

516
00:39:13,612 --> 00:39:14,657
调查指出
there's

517
00:39:14,792 --> 00:39:15,684
共有四位米尔巴领导军官
only four Mirbat survivors in Britain.

518
00:39:15,818 --> 00:39:17,822
我找到其他幸存的三人
I've got Locals on the other three.

519
00:39:17,966 --> 00:39:19,242
你去监视他！
You get the celebrity.

520
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:22,272
瓦魏克雷格？你开玩笑吧！
Warrick Cregg? You're kidding.

521
00:39:22,407 --> 00:39:23,903
希望是场误会
Wish I was.

522
00:39:24,871 --> 00:39:26,626
英国- 航特训练中心

523
00:39:26,761 --> 00:39:29,216
欢迎来到，特勤队地狱选训
DAVIES: Welcome to hell, the SAS selection march.

524
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:31,939
41英哩，55磅重的装备
Forty-one miles, fifty-five pounds of gear.

525
00:39:32,074 --> 00:39:34,404
每隔几天就会死几个人
They lose someone every couple of years.

526
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,828
根本无从下手
Don't you even think about it.

527
00:39:38,346 --> 00:39:38,979
为什么？
Why not?

528
00:39:39,113 --> 00:39:41,607
选训期间这里都是特种精英
During the march this place is crawling with SAS.

529
00:39:41,741 --> 00:39:44,906
你刚也说，意外随时发生
Yeah, you said it yourself. It's an accident waiting to happen.

530
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,661
那你要怎么逮他？
How are you gonna catch him then?

531
00:39:46,795 --> 00:39:49,068
他训练好几个月了，身手正好
He's been training for months, he's like a greyhound.

532
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,552
让他慢下来就好，不是吗？
We'll just have to slow him down, won't we?

533
00:39:53,451 --> 00:39:58,668
胰岛素、迟缓剂，请签收
Insulin. Chlorpropamide. Initial here.

534
00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:07,942
有啥动静？
Anything doing?

535
00:40:08,076 --> 00:40:10,790
没，克雷格还跟女人在里面
No, Cregg's still in there with his missus.

536
00:40:12,238 --> 00:40:14,540
老大这个给你，让你有精神
Here, boss, this will keep you going.

537
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:16,190
干杯
Cheers.

538
00:40:39,302 --> 00:40:40,290
潘纳
Pennock.

539
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,410
我要你过来，支援我
I need you back here, mate. Pronto.

540
00:41:00,842 --> 00:41:02,147
你在干嘛？
(WOMEN SCREAMING)

541
00:41:03,403 --> 00:41:04,899
你干嘛？你疯了

542
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,447
靠！给我滚开
Get out of the fucking way!

543
00:41:50,665 --> 00:41:51,230
他是个疯子，小心

544
00:41:51,374 --> 00:41:52,774
不可思议
WOMAN: Maniac!

545
00:44:51,309 --> 00:44:52,134
不敢相信
You wouldn't fucking believe it,

546
00:44:52,268 --> 00:44:53,793
有人也在监视克雷格
somebody was watching Cregg.

547
00:44:53,966 --> 00:44:54,465
什么？
What? Mmm.

548
00:44:55,558 --> 00:44:57,601
你认为是沙漠的杀手同党？
You think he's from the same stable as the shooter in the desert?

549
00:44:57,735 --> 00:45:01,044
身手不错，不过已经太迟了
Maybe. He was good. Whoever he is, he's too late.

550
00:45:01,485 --> 00:45:05,283
很好，用药物拖
Ah, good, good. Chroma slows him down.

551
00:45:05,292 --> 00:45:09,541
胰岛素导致休克
Insulin sends him into shock.

552
00:45:10,222 --> 00:45:11,363
让人体温过低
Hypothermia to you.

553
00:45:11,497 --> 00:45:12,773
你本来打算何时下药？
And when were you planning on getting it to him?

554
00:45:12,907 --> 00:45:14,317
在选训之前
Before the march.

555
00:45:14,633 --> 00:45:17,357
怎么做？那可是特种队基地
How? It's an SAS base, Danny.

556
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:19,323
你曾在那受过训
That you trained in.

557
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:22,727
回想整个地方，警戒配置
So think back. The security layout, the lot.

558
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:26,180
你疯了
You're nuts.

559
00:45:26,314 --> 00:45:27,619
你要动手吗？
Are you gonna do it?

560
00:45:28,395 --> 00:45:31,263
你真的是个超级大疯子
Man, you really are one crazy son of a bitch, Danny.

561
00:45:37,065 --> 00:45:41,668
英国  航特选训中心

562
00:45:46,694 --> 00:45:48,996
没时间了，你剩不到一分钟
Clock's ticking. You've got under a minute, all right?

563
00:46:01,866 --> 00:46:03,276
有人来了
We've got company.

564
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:11,523
今晚真不错
Lovely night.

565
00:46:11,658 --> 00:46:12,904
你不能停在这
You can't stop here, mate.

566
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:14,084
我没停，是卡车故障
I didn't stop, the truck did.

567
00:46:14,218 --> 00:46:15,494
你不搞定它，我们就搞你
If you don't fucking move it, we will.

568
00:46:15,628 --> 00:46:18,208
好啦！可是它漏油
All right, all right. But it's pissing oil, mate.

569
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:19,944
我没办法
There's nothing I can do about it.

570
00:46:36,363 --> 00:46:37,475
把收音机关掉
Turn off the bloody radio.

571
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:05,843
你的工具呢？
MAN: Where's your gear?

572
00:47:18,445 --> 00:47:21,092
准备！快上车！
Right. On the trucks!

573
00:47:21,226 --> 00:47:23,499
我不管你是哪个军团
SERGEANT 1: I don't care what regiment you're from.

574
00:47:23,624 --> 00:47:25,571
不管你自以为有多行
I don't care how great you think you are.

575
00:47:25,705 --> 00:47:27,364
让我看你有什么能耐，臭娘们！
Let's see what you're made of, ladies.

576
00:47:27,499 --> 00:47:28,515
快上车
On the trucks.

577
00:47:28,649 --> 00:47:29,992
快点
SERGEANT 2: Come on!

578
00:47:30,731 --> 00:47:32,140
动作快
Get moving, you lot.

579
00:47:56,653 --> 00:47:58,888
只有用一半的剂量
He only got half the dose.

580
00:47:59,655 --> 00:48:00,701
这够吗？
Is it enough?

581
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:03,808
药效快发作了，盯紧他
MEIER: Enough? He's a dead man walking. Stay on him, okay?

582
00:48:23,085 --> 00:48:25,060
他的名字叫萨林
DANNY: His name was Salim bin Amr.

583
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:26,566
你记得是你动手杀他吗？
Do you remember the name?

584
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:27,621
想清楚，你杀了他吗？
Did you kill him?

585
00:48:27,755 --> 00:48:29,126
对，是我杀的
Think back.

586
00:48:29,261 --> 00:48:34,449
我宰了那混蛋，又怎样？
Did you kill him, Major? CREGG: Yeah, I did. I did the bastard. So bloody what?

587
00:48:34,507 --> 00:48:36,741
丹尼不想这么做
Danny didn't want to do this.

588
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:37,998
你做的？
DANNY: You did?

589
00:48:39,177 --> 00:48:41,824
你儿子也不想回去沙漠
And your boy doesn't want to go back to the desert.

590
00:48:54,953 --> 00:48:57,926
国防部长遗憾宣布…
TV BROADCASTER: The Ministry of Defence today announced the death of an army officer during maneuvers.

591
00:48:57,926 --> 00:49:01,811
33岁瓦魏克雷格少校
Thirty-three-year-old, Major Warrick Steven Cregg,

592
00:49:01,926 --> 00:49:05,886
在特种队训练中死于意外
died of exposure during an SAS exercise on the Brecon Beacons.

593
00:49:06,539 --> 00:49:08,994
当时的天候很糟…
Weather conditions at the time were described as appalling, with...

594
00:49:26,122 --> 00:49:28,290
请放尊重一点
Show a bit of respect, lads.

595
00:49:39,597 --> 00:49:40,489
百发百中！
Top that.

596
00:49:40,613 --> 00:49:42,886
我带礼物来了
I come bearing gifts.

597
00:49:45,447 --> 00:49:47,010
安静!
Oi!

598
00:49:47,854 --> 00:49:50,952
只是一点小小心意
AGENT: From my boys in Angola.

599
00:49:52,074 --> 00:49:54,462
我希望你会喜欢这食物
I have no idea how you're meant to eat this.

600
00:49:57,675 --> 00:49:58,567
是谁在盯我们？
Who's on our ass?

601
00:49:58,701 --> 00:50:00,389
是我！不用担心
I'm on it. Don't worry.

602
00:50:00,523 --> 00:50:02,249
只剩一个人头
Look, there's only one more to go.

603
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:05,443
在这之后，我就让你们接轻松的
After this is done, I'll get you boys a nice, cushy job in the sun.

604
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,538
这是最后一次
There is no "after this."

605
00:50:12,971 --> 00:50:16,002
我是头兀鹰，依附杀手过活
I'm a vulture. I live off killers.

606
00:50:16,136 --> 00:50:18,208
你的想法很独特
It gives me a unique perspective.

607
00:50:18,342 --> 00:50:20,423
听说过宿命吗？就在你身上!
Have you heard of the two percent? That's you.

608
00:50:20,557 --> 00:50:22,533
戴维斯、特勤队，你们全部
Davies, the SAS, all you lot.

609
00:50:22,667 --> 00:50:24,451
特务、杀手或是英雄
Mercenaries, hit men, heroes.

610
00:50:24,585 --> 00:50:28,095
你们都是天生杀手命
You're all part of that two percent of men who are natural killers.

611
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:30,435
所以你永远逃不了
That's why you'll never get out.

612
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:33,092
你无法违背你的天性，丹尼
You can't run away from who you are, Danny.

613
00:50:34,953 --> 00:50:38,405
那不是我，我也没做那些事
That's not who I am, that's what I've done.

614
00:50:38,923 --> 00:50:40,611
我可以做别的
And I can do something else.

615
00:50:40,745 --> 00:50:43,114
是啊，那样听来不错
Yeah, yeah.

616
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:45,828
不过我们先解决正事吧！
That's all nice and good. But let's just take care of business first, shall we?

617
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:50,211
你第三个目标，赛门迈肯少校
Your third target, Major Simon McCann,

618
00:50:50,345 --> 00:50:51,975
人称 疯狗赛门
Mad Simon McCann of late.

619
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:53,280
你怎么找他的？
How'd you find him?

620
00:50:53,414 --> 00:50:55,802
四处打听，这很简单
Asked around. It was easy.

621
00:50:55,946 --> 00:50:59,494
他现在成了垃圾佣兵
These days, he's your basic "cash for trash" mercenary.

622
00:51:00,521 --> 00:51:01,949
他很容易搞定
He's a sitting duck.

623
00:51:03,273 --> 00:51:05,661
我刚刚不是说带礼物来吗？
Now didn't I tell you I came bearing gifts?

624
00:51:06,505 --> 00:51:08,260
你知道哪能找到他
You know where to find me.

625
00:51:10,638 --> 00:51:13,352
别相信那家伙？满口谎话
DAVIES: You don't trust that snake, do you?

626
00:51:13,477 --> 00:51:14,887
是吗？你怎么知道？
He's lying. Yeah? How do you know?

627
00:51:15,021 --> 00:51:16,393
他的嘴唇在发抖
His lips were moving.

628
00:51:16,517 --> 00:51:18,215
他献上第三个目标
He just gave us a third target.

629
00:51:18,349 --> 00:51:19,970
你就不用再费心思
You've done nothing on that last file.

630
00:51:20,104 --> 00:51:21,255
有人盯上我们
Someone's onto us.

631
00:51:21,389 --> 00:51:23,969
我要救杭特，我要结束此事
I want Hunter out of there.

632
00:51:24,103 --> 00:51:26,012
拿到钱后我要享受一下
I want this finished. And I want to be around to enjoy the money when it is.

633
00:51:26,156 --> 00:51:29,186
你该先买一对蛋蛋！
The first thing you should buy is a pair of balls.

634
00:51:29,416 --> 00:51:31,593
准备去猎杀迈肯吧！
We're going after McCann, all right?

635
00:51:38,029 --> 00:51:39,486
我好想你
ANNE: I miss you.

636
00:51:40,206 --> 00:51:43,102
我对你还不熟，但我好想你
There's a lot I don't know about you, but I do know that much.

637
00:51:44,329 --> 00:51:45,672
我说服自己一切都很好
I convince myself that everything's okay

638
00:51:45,806 --> 00:51:48,482
因为我跟你一起时，我很快乐
because when I'm with you I'm happy.

639
00:51:50,026 --> 00:51:50,477
但当你离开后
But then you go away

640
00:51:50,602 --> 00:51:53,316
我发现对你好陌生
and I realize that I know nothing about you.

641
00:51:53,929 --> 00:51:55,358
不知道你去哪，去做什么？
I don't know where you go and I don't know what you do,

642
00:51:55,502 --> 00:51:56,960
我在想
I mean,

643
00:51:57,094 --> 00:51:59,233
你有另一个人生
you've got a whole another life, Danny.

644
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:02,475
有别段感情？
Is there someone else?

645
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:03,529
拜托，安
Come on, Anne.

646
00:52:03,654 --> 00:52:05,313
不然呢？
Well, then, what is it?

647
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:07,298
天哪！你有什么没告诉我？
I mean, Jesus, what are you not telling me?

648
00:52:07,433 --> 00:52:08,804
你在隐藏什么？
What are you hiding?

649
00:52:08,938 --> 00:52:10,943
能不能等我回去再谈？
Can we talk about this when I get back?

650
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:13,283
我恨你！
To hell with it.

651
00:52:17,129 --> 00:52:18,212
干！
Fuck.

652
00:52:29,318 --> 00:52:30,267
怎样？
What?

653
00:52:30,824 --> 00:52:35,149
有位英雄丹尼，也难过美人关…
You show me a beautiful woman, I'll show you a bloke that's sick of her shit.

654
00:52:35,149 --> 00:52:36,223
闭嘴啦
Shut up.

655
00:52:36,357 --> 00:52:37,700
承认吧！
Roger that.

656
00:52:40,903 --> 00:52:41,469
那就是他？
DANNY: That him?

657
00:52:41,613 --> 00:52:42,620
就是他
DAVIES: That's him.

658
00:52:42,764 --> 00:52:44,423
疯狗赛门
Major Simon McCann.

659
00:52:44,557 --> 00:52:48,202
一直在苏丹服役，四年前退休
Served in the Sultan's forces till he was pensioned out four years ago.

660
00:52:48,969 --> 00:52:50,244
再来一台
And another.

661
00:52:51,338 --> 00:52:53,227
你在搞什么鬼？
Oi!

662
00:52:53,352 --> 00:52:54,694
滚开啦，老头
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

663
00:52:54,829 --> 00:52:55,720
尝点拳头？
Piss off, grandpa. You want some?

664
00:52:58,924 --> 00:53:00,775
看来不像受过伤
DANNY: Doesn't look like an invalid.

665
00:53:01,829 --> 00:53:04,390
当时，一枚炸弹在他车下爆炸
Like I said, a bomb went off under his jeep,

666
00:53:04,524 --> 00:53:05,953
炸坏了他的神经
scrambled his wiring.

667
00:53:06,088 --> 00:53:09,502
他无法工作，但是个疯子
He can't keep a job. He's a fucking psycho.

668
00:53:12,043 --> 00:53:13,223
天哪
Jesus.

669
00:53:15,467 --> 00:53:17,356
好了，够了
Come on, mate, that's enough.

670
00:53:18,507 --> 00:53:20,233
他在这干嘛？
What's he doing here?

671
00:53:21,768 --> 00:53:24,261
那就是我在医院遇到的人
That's the one I went head-to-head with at the hospital.

672
00:53:29,066 --> 00:53:29,536
是哦
Right.

673
00:53:30,054 --> 00:53:31,368
等等…
Wait, wait, wait.

674
00:53:37,707 --> 00:53:38,753
走
Let's go.

675
00:53:39,942 --> 00:53:40,891
跟踪他
Stick with him.

676
00:54:17,958 --> 00:54:19,972
老迈，是我，你还好吗？
Mac, it's me. You okay?

677
00:54:20,106 --> 00:54:23,453
在修理挡路的小混混
McCANN: Oh, yeah, still scraping skinheads off my doorstep.

678
00:54:23,597 --> 00:54:26,695
好吧，只是确认一下
All right, mate. I was just checking in.

679
00:54:33,993 --> 00:54:37,225
开绿色跑车，他是谁？
Bloke who drives that green Jag, what's his name?

680
00:54:38,539 --> 00:54:42,625
他叫史派基洛根，被军中辞退
AGENT: His name's Spike Logan. He's an ex-soldier of some kind.

681
00:54:42,759 --> 00:54:45,962
某次逞英雄时眼睛中枪
He got his eye shot out playing a hero somewhere.

682
00:54:46,087 --> 00:54:49,434
他目前无业，怪里怪气的
He's got no job and he keeps odd hours.

683
00:54:51,822 --> 00:54:53,510
没有其他资料吗？
Don't you know who these guys are?

684
00:54:53,644 --> 00:54:55,620
你不是最会打探秘密？
I mean, secrets being your bread and butter.

685
00:54:55,754 --> 00:54:56,895
不用担心
Don't worry about it.

686
00:54:57,029 --> 00:54:59,619
我很担心，你也该担心
I do worry about it. You should, too.

687
00:54:59,753 --> 00:55:02,467
我的人一有行动，他们就出现
Every move my guys make, these lot are waiting.

688
00:55:02,601 --> 00:55:07,454
我想你该找几个人逼问一下
You ask me, I think it's time you put those fancy shoes of yours on a few throats.

689
00:55:07,598 --> 00:55:10,274
是吗！也没人来逼问你
Yes. But no one is asking you.

690
00:55:15,462 --> 00:55:18,598
你来信应征保全职缺，迈肯先生
DAVIES: You'll be interviewing for a security position, Mr. McCann.

691
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:19,106
对！
McCANN: Right.

692
00:55:19,241 --> 00:55:21,216
其实是特种队的朋友介绍你
Actually we got your name from a mutual friend in the SAS.

693
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:23,211
是吗，真的？
Yeah, really?

694
00:55:23,336 --> 00:55:25,407
那我们就周二10点见
So, we'll see you Tuesday the 17th, at 10:00.

695
00:55:25,542 --> 00:55:26,280
好
Okay.

696
00:55:26,405 --> 00:55:27,460
期待那一天的到来
We look forward to it.

697
00:55:27,594 --> 00:55:28,294
到时候见
See you then.

698
00:55:28,428 --> 00:55:30,145
就这么说定
All right, my son.

699
00:55:31,142 --> 00:55:32,197
他会到
He'll be there.

700
00:55:32,332 --> 00:55:32,859
很好！
Good.

701
00:55:33,032 --> 00:55:34,144
小意思！
I don't get it.

702
00:55:36,906 --> 00:55:38,211
迈肯住这里
McCann lives here.

703
00:55:38,345 --> 00:55:41,443
他周二10点会来面谈
He'll be here for the interview, Tuesday at 10:00.

704
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,099
他会走这条路
He'll take this road.

705
00:55:44,233 --> 00:55:46,439
波士顿路，太赞了！
The Boston Brakes. Perfect.

706
00:55:46,573 --> 00:55:47,906
波士顿马路崎山区
They weren't perfect in Boston.

707
00:55:48,041 --> 00:55:49,182
三不管地带
I wasn't at the controls.

708
00:55:49,326 --> 00:55:50,304
还有十天
We've got 10 days.

709
00:55:50,438 --> 00:55:51,426
十天？
MEIER: Ten days?

710
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,836
越快搞定此事越好
The quicker we get this done, the better.

711
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:54,975
我需要找些帮手
I'm going to need to bring in some help.

712
00:55:55,109 --> 00:55:55,560
好吧！
Okay. DAVIES: "Okay." Just like that?

713
00:55:55,694 --> 00:55:58,955
就这样？迈肯受到严密监控
McCann's being watched.

714
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:00,479
你要怎么让他招认？
How are you gonna get a confession out of him?

715
00:56:00,614 --> 00:56:03,520
我们没要他招，造假就好
We aren't. We'll fake it.

716
00:56:03,654 --> 00:56:06,819
灯光和摄影弄烂一点，就可以了
Bit of bad lighting and camera work, you could be him.

717
00:56:06,953 --> 00:56:10,022
我们只要在报告中做手脚就好
What we'll do is play back what he admitted to in the reports.

718
00:56:26,661 --> 00:56:27,112
你是谁？
Who are you?

719
00:56:27,237 --> 00:56:29,184
这国家能带枪上直升机的
I'm the one they let fly around in an unmarked chopper

720
00:56:29,318 --> 00:56:30,699
只有我一个
with a gun in my pocket.

721
00:56:30,823 --> 00:56:32,320
你可以叫我老大
You can call me MFWIC.

722
00:56:32,454 --> 00:56:33,355
老大？
"MFWIC"?

723
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,165
我就是他妈的老大！
Mother Fucker What's In Charge.

724
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,112
我们有个问题
We have questions.

725
00:56:38,477 --> 00:56:42,332
关于这个非法聚会- 羽毛人俱乐部
About this little illegal club of yours, The Feather Men.

726
00:56:42,476 --> 00:56:45,890
你的打手，该现身了吧？
Your attack dog, time to bring him to heel, eh?

727
00:56:49,707 --> 00:56:51,078
到时我们会安排
And then we'll put that on the agenda.

728
00:56:51,213 --> 00:56:52,354
各位
Gentlemen.

729
00:56:52,488 --> 00:56:54,243
请稍候一下
We'll be with you in a minute.

730
00:57:00,525 --> 00:57:03,105
我要派人全天候盯着迈肯少校
I want to put Locals on Major McCann around the clock.

731
00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:06,107
我知道迈肯是你的老朋友
I realize McCann is an old friend of yours,

732
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:07,871
可是他跟此事有咯关？
but what has it to do with us?

733
00:57:10,633 --> 00:57:13,386
这样你们才能逮住凶手
But this is our chance to get the bastards who killed Cregg and Harris.

734
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:16,263
政府当局找不到他杀证据
The authorities found no evidence of foul play in either case.

735
00:57:16,397 --> 00:57:19,610
你说什么没证据？我这里就有
What are you talking about, "No evidence?" I've got the evidence right here.

736
00:57:23,177 --> 00:57:26,275
每个人都知道他们是被谋杀的
Everybody in this room knows that those men were killed.

737
00:57:27,627 --> 00:57:30,111
大家都知道迈肯就是下一个
Everybody knows that McCann is going to be next.

738
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:31,042
够了，史派基
That's enough, Spike.

739
00:57:31,176 --> 00:57:32,288
我们得采取行动
We have to do something.

740
00:57:32,423 --> 00:57:33,573
我们可以进行表决
THE DON: Well, we could put it to the vote.

741
00:57:33,708 --> 00:57:35,779
对，可是那得全体委员出席
Yes, but that would require the full committee.

742
00:57:35,914 --> 00:57:38,944
需要一点时间
And it will have to wait.

743
00:57:54,087 --> 00:57:54,471
史派基
Spike. That was a set-up.

744
00:57:54,605 --> 00:57:58,528
那是陷阱！把他派去往陷阱跳！
He sent him away. He knew there'd be a vote.

745
00:57:58,662 --> 00:57:59,679
史派基，拜托
Spike, please. Look, listen.

746
00:57:59,813 --> 00:58:03,112
听着，事情超乎想像
This is getting big.

747
00:58:03,783 --> 00:58:06,401
上级在质疑，我们倍感压力
The powers that be are asking questions. Pressure's being applied.

748
00:58:06,536 --> 00:58:08,003
他们要保护自己的名声
They have their reputations to protect.

749
00:58:08,137 --> 00:58:11,273
我了解名声的重要性
I'm not doing this to protect reputations.

750
00:58:11,398 --> 00:58:12,674
我会处理这事情
You know, a light touch is one thing,

751
00:58:12,808 --> 00:58:15,177
可是要完全不碰？我做不到
but no touch at all? I can't do this.

752
00:58:15,301 --> 00:58:18,303
你知道此事不被认可
You realize this thing is set up for maximum deniability?

753
00:58:18,437 --> 00:58:19,492
线民是你找的
You're the only one who knows the Locals.

754
00:58:19,627 --> 00:58:21,478
他们只听你下达的命令
All their orders come through you.

755
00:58:21,612 --> 00:58:23,367
所以呢？
So?

756
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:26,944
这事要是曝光，死的就是你
So? If this comes out, you're the one who takes the fall.

757
00:58:27,078 --> 00:58:29,380
怎么死？
Fall? From where?

758
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:32,900
我已经受够那些委员
I am done with this whole committee thing.

759
00:58:33,638 --> 00:58:35,067
我自己去找他
I'm gonna find him.

760
00:58:37,676 --> 00:58:40,639
他虽然只是个孩子，但很有潜力
MEIER: He's a good kid, don't worry. I'm shtupping his mom.

761
00:58:40,908 --> 00:58:42,279
他知道他的任务吧！
DAVIES: Does he know he can't bring his mom on the job?

762
00:58:42,413 --> 00:58:44,197
知道、知道
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

763
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:04,260
向阿曼的孤魂打声招呼
DAVIES: Tell your mates in Oman I said hello.

764
00:59:04,395 --> 00:59:07,627
丹尼，我有点紧张？
Danny, is this what it was like when you were first starting?

765
00:59:07,751 --> 00:59:10,619
这是你第一次？天哪
This is your first job? Jesus.

766
00:59:11,789 --> 00:59:14,685
我第一次杀人，吐了一天
My first time, I puked for a day afterwards.

767
00:59:14,829 --> 00:59:19,202
我当时年轻又蠢，跟他们没两样
I was young and dumb, just the way the army likes them. I could be good at this, man.

768
00:59:19,595 --> 00:59:21,446
我可以轻松了结这人吧？
I mean, it's easy, yeah?

769
00:59:21,581 --> 00:59:23,336
杀人很简单
Killing's easy.

770
00:59:25,225 --> 00:59:27,709
承受这一切活着才困难
Living with it is the hard part.

771
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:33,338
要是我看到他，我会通知你
PORTER: If I see him, I'll give you a bell.

772
00:59:33,482 --> 00:59:36,100
不必害怕传话出去
Don't be shy about spreading the word.

773
00:59:36,743 --> 00:59:38,536
找到的人都有重赏
There's a very tidy finder's fee.

774
00:59:38,661 --> 00:59:40,263
我会睁大眼睛找
I'll keep my eyes peeled.

775
00:59:40,397 --> 00:59:42,536
剩一个，今晚是关键
One more and we'll call it a night.

776
00:59:46,573 --> 00:59:47,945
生意上门
JAKE: We're on.

777
00:59:50,026 --> 00:59:51,522
他迟到了
MEIER: He's late.

778
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:56,240
保持75尺，安全距离范围
Just keep me at 75 feet

779
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,695
好
and give me a clear line of sight. Yeah, okay.

780
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:45,919
哪来的烂司机!
Where'd you buy your license?

781
01:00:49,189 --> 01:00:51,750
跟紧他，小心点
On his tail. Doing 60.

782
01:00:57,005 --> 01:00:59,719
一分钟内你就能看到丹尼
You'll have a visual on Danny in one minute.

783
01:01:04,198 --> 01:01:05,416
盯紧他，杰克
Stay with him, Jake.

784
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:07,171
我找到他了
I got him.

785
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:10,374
目标入笼
DAVIES: We have target in sight.

786
01:01:10,508 --> 01:01:11,266
我会悼念他的
JAKE: Gonna miss it.

787
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:14,114
快切进去，快点，切进去！
Come on, get in. Get in behind him!

788
01:01:14,249 --> 01:01:15,179
空间不够
Just do it, get in! There's not enough room!

789
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:15,841
逼他
Push him!

790
01:01:15,975 --> 01:01:17,059
我没办法卡位
I can't get in there.

791
01:01:17,193 --> 01:01:19,600
那就超车！快！
Okay, then overtake him. Go! Pass him!

792
01:01:21,259 --> 01:01:22,439
麦尔，你在干嘛？
DAVIES: What the hell are you doing, Meier?

793
01:01:22,573 --> 01:01:23,714
我需要距离倒数
MEIER: I need a range countdown.

794
01:01:23,849 --> 01:01:25,028
麦尔，别搞砸了
Meier: Don't screw this up.

795
01:01:25,162 --> 01:01:26,572
我直接倒车
I'll operate looking backwards.

796
01:01:26,697 --> 01:01:27,646
别激动
Relax, Meier.

797
01:01:27,781 --> 01:01:29,603
戴维斯会帮你倒数
Davies will give you the countdown.

798
01:01:33,573 --> 01:01:34,820
四百公尺
DAVIES: 400 meters.

799
01:01:39,116 --> 01:01:40,421
好，帮我看路
MEIER: Okay, range me.

800
01:01:44,295 --> 01:01:45,571
三百公尺
300 meters.

801
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:48,899
走外线，麦尔
Outside lane, Meier.

802
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:53,320
二百公尺
200 meters.

803
01:01:57,290 --> 01:01:58,336
他来了
Here he comes.

804
01:02:00,072 --> 01:02:01,155
剩一百公尺
100 meters.

805
01:02:10,669 --> 01:02:11,494
现在！就是现在！
Now, now. Now, Meier! Shut up!

806
01:02:11,628 --> 01:02:12,932
闭嘴啦！
Now, Meier!

807
01:02:14,342 --> 01:02:15,771
甩尾
Fishtail! Fishtail!

808
01:02:26,061 --> 01:02:27,462
你成功了！
JAKE: You fucking got him!

809
01:02:27,596 --> 01:02:31,288
- 马的！ - 他死了，他死翘翘了
You got him, man. MEIER: Oh, fuck, he's dead. He's dead as Elvis.

810
01:02:39,852 --> 01:02:40,965
大功告成
You got him, man!

811
01:02:41,416 --> 01:02:42,730
停车！
Stop the car.

812
01:02:43,401 --> 01:02:45,472
我们要确认目标死亡
We gotta be sure Elvis has left the building.

813
01:02:54,152 --> 01:02:57,796
目标有人监控！赶快离开！
DAVIES: Target had a minder. Head to the exit point.

814
01:03:00,971 --> 01:03:02,380
引他过来
Bring him to me.

815
01:03:04,298 --> 01:03:05,056
他有人保护
He had a fucking minder. Fuck!

816
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:05,823
靠，被看到！
You got him, man. You got him!

817
01:03:05,958 --> 01:03:08,739
闭嘴啦！开车！快！
Shut up! Drive! Go! Go! Go!

818
01:03:09,036 --> 01:03:09,410
他是谁？
Who is he?

819
01:03:09,544 --> 01:03:11,520
我不知道，状况回报
I don't know. Give me an update, Davies.

820
01:03:13,381 --> 01:03:15,040
他追上来了！
Oh, man, he's coming fast!

821
01:03:17,063 --> 01:03:20,123
那里有院子，左转进去
Up here there's a yard. Take a left. Shit! Up here to the left. Keep going.

822
01:03:20,142 --> 01:03:21,542
坐稳了！
Hold on.

823
01:03:23,019 --> 01:03:24,515
呼叫，戴维斯
Come in, Davies.

824
01:03:29,579 --> 01:03:31,199
戴维斯，你跑哪去了？
Davies, where the fuck are you?

825
01:03:31,468 --> 01:03:33,501
逮到你了，混帐东西
Got you, you bastards.

826
01:03:34,796 --> 01:03:37,568
去他的！快！快！
MEIER: Fuck this! Go! Go!

827
01:03:40,301 --> 01:03:41,672
来了、他来了！
JAKE: Here he comes! Here he comes!

828
01:03:45,959 --> 01:03:47,388
下车
Get out of the car!

829
01:03:48,203 --> 01:03:50,025
你谁派来的？
Where the fuck do you guys come from?

830
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:52,011
- 站远一点 - 别激动
Step away from the car. Easy.

831
01:03:52,135 --> 01:03:53,411
- 杰克！ - 别激动
Jake. Yeah?

832
01:03:53,545 --> 01:03:55,933
检查车子！慢慢来！
Take it easy. Check the car. Slowly.

833
01:03:56,873 --> 01:03:57,985
不、不！
No, no, no, no!

834
01:04:07,883 --> 01:04:09,091
不！
No!

835
01:04:27,495 --> 01:04:30,037
没身份证
He had no ID. Nothing.

836
01:04:30,631 --> 01:04:31,619
这家伙是谁？
Not a fucking thing.

837
01:04:32,712 --> 01:04:33,921
在搞什么！
Who the fuck is he?

838
01:04:36,424 --> 01:04:38,361
到底在搞什么！
This shouldn't have happened.

839
01:04:38,361 --> 01:04:40,193
别激动，丹尼
This should not have fucking happened! Take it easy, Danny.

840
01:04:40,327 --> 01:04:40,778
丹尼
Danny...

841
01:04:40,903 --> 01:04:42,312
别激动？
Take it easy?

842
01:04:43,434 --> 01:04:45,822
愚蠢的笨蛋，多此一举！
We were out of there. Clean. Done.

843
01:05:06,566 --> 01:05:08,609
坎贝没回应，你那边呢？
PENNOCK: Look, I'm getting nothing. Campbell's not picking up.

844
01:05:08,743 --> 01:05:10,019
- 靠 - 没消息但这里有辆烧焦的车
Ls there anything at your end? Fuck.

845
01:05:10,153 --> 01:05:12,254
这些混帐东西是谁？
Who are these bastards?

846
01:05:12,397 --> 01:05:15,390
不知道，不过他们在找失踪的人
I don't know. But they're looking for their man and they're not legit.

847
01:05:15,533 --> 01:05:17,864
杰克，打这个号码
Jake, call this number.

848
01:05:19,178 --> 01:05:21,729
告诉探员我们需要潜逃出境
Tell the Agent we need a cleanup crew here ASAP.

849
01:05:21,863 --> 01:05:24,136
还有把无线电接上我的车
And wire that radio into my car.

850
01:05:24,261 --> 01:05:25,920
我来打吧
Gimme here.

851
01:05:29,516 --> 01:05:30,082
该结束了吧！
That's it then.

852
01:05:30,216 --> 01:05:31,329
没错！
Yeah.

853
01:05:31,837 --> 01:05:32,796
丹尼
Done.

854
01:05:33,928 --> 01:05:36,863
我今晚飞走，你也该走
I fly tonight.

855
01:05:36,997 --> 01:05:38,052
他们追上来了
You should get going, too. They're close.

856
01:05:38,186 --> 01:05:39,615
麦尔那份呢？
What happens to Meier's cut?

857
01:05:40,229 --> 01:05:41,830
就送给其他人
There has to be somebody.

858
01:05:41,965 --> 01:05:46,041
可怜的家伙，我会帮他烧栋房
Poor sod. I'll have a hooker for him. He'd like that. (CHUCKLES)

859
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:47,460
好
Yeah.

860
01:05:47,882 --> 01:05:49,253
小心点
Be safe.

861
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:51,267
你也是
You too, Davies.

862
01:05:58,412 --> 01:06:01,989
我还在找坎贝，情况不妙
PENNOCK: Sorry. We 're still looking for Campbell, but it looks bad.

863
01:06:31,211 --> 01:06:34,088
谢谢，还有什么需要…
Thank you, sir. If there's anything else...

864
01:06:34,117 --> 01:06:37,416
客房服务，要带点情色
Room service. Something exotic.

865
01:06:58,630 --> 01:06:59,014
怎样？
Yeah?

866
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:00,769
我找到你的威尔斯人了
PORTER: I found your Welshman

867
01:07:01,929 --> 01:07:03,013
你确定是他？
You sure it's him?

868
01:07:03,147 --> 01:07:04,548
千真万确！
I'm sure.

869
01:07:35,045 --> 01:07:36,292
去他的！
(SCREAMING) Fucking hell!

870
01:07:38,056 --> 01:07:39,399
起来，穿衣服
Get up. Get dressed. Move!

871
01:07:39,533 --> 01:07:42,276
快点，起来
Look... Get up!

872
01:07:43,245 --> 01:07:45,211
别告诉任何人，你懂吗？
Don't say a word to anyone. Do you understand?

873
01:07:46,534 --> 01:07:48,740
你杀了赛门迈肯，对吧？
You killed Simon McCann, didn't you?

874
01:07:49,162 --> 01:07:52,058
还有坎贝，他人呢？
Yeah? And Campbell. Where is he, you fucker?

875
01:07:52,202 --> 01:07:53,478
没听过他
Never heard of him.

876
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:57,985
你就这点能耐？
That all you got?

877
01:08:01,447 --> 01:08:03,883
我们逮到那个威尔斯人了
Yeah, Spike? We got the Welshman.

878
01:08:03,941 --> 01:08:05,667
我们现在就带他回去
We 're bringing him to you now. Over.

879
01:08:06,444 --> 01:08:08,899
很好，潘纳，干的好
SPIKE: Nice work, Pennock. Well done.

880
01:08:09,033 --> 01:08:11,402
我很期待见见这个王八蛋
I'm looking forward to meeting the bastard.

881
01:08:16,006 --> 01:08:18,854
我要切断你老二喂鲨鱼，喜欢吗？
Hey, Spike's gonna cut your dick off and shove it in your mouth. You like that?

882
01:08:18,988 --> 01:08:19,516
听起来不错
I like the sound of that, yeah.

883
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:20,705
- 是吗？ - 是啊
Do you? Yeah, I do.

884
01:08:20,868 --> 01:08:22,086
给我上车，上车
Get in the van.

885
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:24,042
快点，上车
Get in. Come on, get in!

886
01:08:31,782 --> 01:08:34,525
靠，敢耍我，上车！
Fuck me. You're kidding. Come on. Get in!

887
01:08:40,461 --> 01:08:42,600
好了，混帐东西
There you are, you prick.

888
01:08:56,458 --> 01:08:57,762
别挡路，笨蛋

889
01:08:57,896 --> 01:08:58,280
- 打开 - 滚开
Open up.

890
01:08:58,405 --> 01:08:59,652
等等

891
01:09:13,356 --> 01:09:14,565
老板？
Boss.

892
01:09:20,587 --> 01:09:22,208
要我看一具死尸！
What am I meant to do with that?

893
01:09:22,918 --> 01:09:23,906
他身上有这个
He had this on him.

894
01:09:24,299 --> 01:09:26,466
电话号码，干的好
A phone number. Great work.

895
01:09:28,173 --> 01:09:31,779
我是要逼问活口，不要整团烂泥
That pile of mincemeat was our best chance of finding out who these bastards are.

896
01:09:32,518 --> 01:09:35,999
处理掉他，还有追踪那个号码
Print him and trace that bloody number.

897
01:09:37,927 --> 01:09:39,931
一群笨蛋！
You fucking idiots!

898
01:09:55,717 --> 01:09:56,868
别动！
DANNY: Drop it.

899
01:09:57,702 --> 01:10:00,704
把枪，放地上
Left hand. Put the gun on the floor.

900
01:10:09,028 --> 01:10:10,371
踢过来
Kick it to me.

901
01:10:13,641 --> 01:10:16,327
那个威尔斯人，他人呢？
The Welshman, they were bringing him to you. Where is he?

902
01:10:16,461 --> 01:10:18,341
他死了
He didn't make it.

903
01:10:19,012 --> 01:10:20,671
是你？你干的？
You? You do it?

904
01:10:20,805 --> 01:10:23,462
一辆卡车，他挡到它了
A truck. He made a break for it.

905
01:10:23,596 --> 01:10:24,670
他很走运
He got lucky.

906
01:10:25,131 --> 01:10:26,473
车已经开很慢
Would have been very slow otherwise.

907
01:10:26,598 --> 01:10:28,161
那是我朋友
Yeah, well that was my fucking friend.

908
01:10:28,296 --> 01:10:29,926
是吗？迈肯是我朋友，还有…
Yeah, and McCann was mine. And what about fucking...

909
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:31,230
坎贝吗？
Campbell?

910
01:10:31,719 --> 01:10:32,765
不是
No.

911
01:10:33,446 --> 01:10:36,860
戴维斯、麦尔、哈里斯
Davies. Meier. Harris.

912
01:10:37,004 --> 01:10:42,470
迈肯、克雷格、坎贝，阎王正忙着
McCann. Cregg. Campbell. Too many names on that list.

913
01:10:42,604 --> 01:10:44,868
不要加上你的名字，史派基
Don't go adding yours, Spike.

914
01:10:45,002 --> 01:10:46,661
进去！
Inside.

915
01:10:49,548 --> 01:10:50,440
你是谁？
Who are you?

916
01:10:51,111 --> 01:10:52,387
不重要
Doesn't matter.

917
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:54,823
今晚之后，我就不存在了
After tonight, I don't exist.

918
01:10:54,957 --> 01:10:56,415
那是什么意思？
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

919
01:10:56,549 --> 01:10:58,304
一切都将结束
It's over.

920
01:10:58,438 --> 01:10:59,714
你这么想？
Done. You think so?

921
01:11:02,054 --> 01:11:04,777
没制服、没战争、不再牵挂
No uniform, no war, not special.

922
01:11:05,669 --> 01:11:07,424
忘记自己是谁
You don't know what to do with yourself.

923
01:11:08,268 --> 01:11:10,369
过着没有羁绊的人生
Nobody knows what to do with you.

924
01:11:10,503 --> 01:11:11,395
错了
Right? Wrong.

925
01:11:11,529 --> 01:11:13,831
你知道我的名字，你逃不了
You know my name but you don't know me.

926
01:11:13,965 --> 01:11:16,104
你根本不知道我多厉害
You have no idea who you're fucking with.

927
01:11:16,228 --> 01:11:17,446
真的？
Really?

928
01:11:19,595 --> 01:11:21,148
别吓我
Don't follow me.

929
01:11:22,155 --> 01:11:24,457
别让我再遇到你！
Don't put your name on that list.

930
01:11:34,565 --> 01:11:36,675
第三份口供
The third confession.

931
01:11:42,602 --> 01:11:44,808
凶手全都已经被杀
SHEIKH AMR: The killers have been killed,

932
01:11:44,932 --> 01:11:47,752
现在你可以回沙漠了
now you can go home.

933
01:11:48,778 --> 01:11:50,783
你可以把人带走了
BAKHAIT: You can have your man.

934
01:11:51,655 --> 01:11:53,765
确认过后，会把钱给你
You will get the money when it's been checked.

935
01:11:54,504 --> 01:11:55,933
带他出来
Bring him out.

936
01:11:57,956 --> 01:11:59,491
带他出来
Bring him out!

937
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:04,775
让我…戴上我的表
Let me put... I just wanna put my watch on.

938
01:12:04,775 --> 01:12:06,118
怎么回事？
What's the matter with you?

939
01:12:06,252 --> 01:12:07,422
- 你还好吧？ - 还好
You all right? Yeah.

940
01:12:07,556 --> 01:12:08,803
有何计划？
What's the plan?

941
01:12:08,937 --> 01:12:10,347
我们离开这里
Get out of here.

942
01:12:10,472 --> 01:12:12,610
好，听来不错
Okay, sounds good.

943
01:12:16,744 --> 01:12:18,815
我本来以为你死定了
I was sure you were gonna get yourself killed, kiddo.

944
01:12:18,950 --> 01:12:21,251
你怎么做到的？怎么成功的？
How in the hell did you do it? How'd you pull it off?

945
01:12:21,386 --> 01:12:22,402
我不想谈
I don't want to talk about it.

946
01:12:22,536 --> 01:12:23,946
我明白，不过谢谢你
I get it.

947
01:12:24,071 --> 01:12:25,155
不是为我，而是为我的孩子
Thank you. Not from me, but from my kids

948
01:12:25,289 --> 01:12:26,881
让他们还能有一个老爸
for having a dad.

949
01:12:27,015 --> 01:12:28,703
感激之情，我无以回报
I could never thank you enough for what you did. Never.

950
01:12:28,837 --> 01:12:31,081
你可以，你可以退出这行
Yeah, you can.

951
01:12:31,206 --> 01:12:32,252
不要再干这行
You can get out of the business. Be done with this shit.

952
01:12:32,395 --> 01:12:34,563
不再杀手，不再干特务
No more soldiering. No more mercenary work.

953
01:12:34,572 --> 01:12:36,193
好吧，好
All right. Okay, okay.

954
01:12:37,258 --> 01:12:40,681
我求你，告诉我你不干了
I'm asking you, please. Tell me you're done.

955
01:12:41,545 --> 01:12:42,686
我不干了，不干了
I'm done. I'm out.

956
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:45,064
很好，别再踏进来了
Good.Stay out.

957
01:12:45,189 --> 01:12:46,752
不然这一切就没意义
Otherwise all this is for nothing.

958
01:12:47,308 --> 01:12:48,929
洋基队战绩如何？
So, how are the Yankees doing?

959
01:13:14,373 --> 01:13:16,003
你可以先打电话来
You could have called.

960
01:13:17,288 --> 01:13:18,631
你不会接
You wouldn't have answered.

961
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:21,978
是不会，很抱歉
No. Sorry about that.

962
01:13:22,764 --> 01:13:26,044
你抱歉？该抱歉的是我
You're sorry? It's me who should be sorry.

963
01:13:29,765 --> 01:13:32,997
工作结束了吗？你要走了？
So it's over? You going back again?

964
01:13:33,764 --> 01:13:35,078
不
No.

965
01:13:37,869 --> 01:13:40,353
你准备告诉我一切了？
And you're ready to tell me everything?

966
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:43,173
你想知道什么都行
Whatever you want to know.

967
01:13:46,347 --> 01:13:47,459
很好!
Good.

968
01:13:49,512 --> 01:13:53,252
只不过我已经不想知道…
Except I don't want to know. Not anymore.

969
01:13:57,990 --> 01:13:59,879
我很想念你，丹尼
I've missed you, Danny.

970
01:14:01,509 --> 01:14:04,578
我不在乎过去，只在乎现在
I don't really care about the past, I just care about now.

971
01:14:24,229 --> 01:14:24,929
老板
Hey, boss.

972
01:14:25,063 --> 01:14:25,763
怎样？

973
01:14:25,898 --> 01:14:26,828
那个号码
That phone number?

974
01:14:26,953 --> 01:14:28,161
那是间公司
That was a business.

975
01:14:28,295 --> 01:14:30,118
那是一家旅行社

帮忙安排特务进出世界各地

978
01:14:55,753 --> 01:14:56,932

喂，丹尼

980
01:15:01,670 --> 01:15:03,166
你怎么会有这个号码？
How'd you get this number?

981
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:07,079
拜托，别侮辱我的专业能力
Please, Danny, don't insult my professionalism.

982
01:15:08,393 --> 01:15:09,342
你要做什么？
What do you want?

983
01:15:09,477 --> 01:15:11,586
任务出状况
We got a problem with the job.

984
01:15:14,761 --> 01:15:15,528
任务早完成了
The job's done. No.

985
01:15:15,653 --> 01:15:17,763
没有，你杀错人
You killed the wrong guy.

986
01:15:17,897 --> 01:15:18,913
还有一个要解决
There's one more to go.

987
01:15:19,048 --> 01:15:20,640
我费尽心血才找到元凶
I busted my nuts setting this job up

988
01:15:20,774 --> 01:15:21,723
我要分一成佣金
and I want my 10%.

989
01:15:21,867 --> 01:15:24,965
不，我已经做完我该做的
No, I did what I had to do.

990
01:15:24,965 --> 01:15:28,677
去跟酋长说吧，他要跟你见面
Tell that to the Sheikh. He wants a London meet with his son.

991
01:15:28,907 --> 01:15:32,446
如果不想来，当心你女友
Check with your girlfriend before you make any rash decisions. Eh?

992
01:16:39,876 --> 01:16:42,216
你在干嘛？快来睡觉
What are you doing? Come to bed.

993
01:16:48,555 --> 01:16:49,476
跟我来，安
Come with me, Anne.

994
01:16:50,061 --> 01:16:50,790
什么？
What?

995
01:16:50,924 --> 01:16:52,199
去巴黎
To Paris.

996
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:54,654
我去伦敦，你到那里等我
You can wait for me there while I'm in London.

997
01:16:54,789 --> 01:16:57,349
明天就去，你不喜欢这里吗?
Leave tomorrow. Nothing's keeping you here, right?

998
01:16:57,484 --> 01:16:58,855
现在是半夜，太仓促了
It's the middle of the night. Anne. Anne!

999
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:01,924
安，他们知道你的事
They know about you.

1000
01:17:01,924 --> 01:17:03,784
谁知道我的事?
Who knows about me?

1001
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:07,179
还有我们的事
And about us.

1002
01:17:39,787 --> 01:17:41,024
何时才能平静？
When will this be over?

1003
01:17:41,158 --> 01:17:42,530
很快
Soon.

1004
01:17:45,033 --> 01:17:46,625
只要一切顺利
If all goes well.

1005
01:17:47,402 --> 01:17:48,811
会顺利吧？
It will, won't it?

1006
01:18:16,134 --> 01:18:17,026
丹尼
Danny.

1007
01:18:17,544 --> 01:18:18,791
帮我照顾她
Keep a good eye on her, huh?

1008
01:18:18,916 --> 01:18:20,863
听着，别自己单枪匹马去
Listen, don't do this on your own.

1009
01:18:20,997 --> 01:18:21,927
没别的办法
No other way.

1010
01:18:22,052 --> 01:18:23,519
戴维斯、麦尔，都是落单遇难
Davies, Meier, all this heat on you.

1011
01:18:23,653 --> 01:18:25,514
拜托，我们上车去伦敦吧
Come on, let's just get in the car, we'll go to London,

1012
01:18:25,639 --> 01:18:26,818
去机场，就这样
be at the airport...

1013
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:28,544
不行，我们讲好的，记得吗？
No. We have a deal, remember?

1014
01:18:28,679 --> 01:18:30,856
我也想了断！
What do you mean? You think I can't cut this, is that it?

1015
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:32,323
而且，我不是保母，拜托
I mean, I'm not a babysitter, come on!

1016
01:18:32,457 --> 01:18:34,980
我要她安全无虞，我只信任你
I need to know she's safe.

1017
01:18:35,114 --> 01:18:37,665
这太扯了，你可以落跑
You're the only one I trust. This is bullshit. You could run, both of you just go, come on.

1018
01:18:37,799 --> 01:18:39,967
总会被找到的，你很清楚
Everyone gets found. You know that.

1019
01:18:40,456 --> 01:18:42,345
你会送命的，小子
You're gonna get yourself killed, kiddo.

1020
01:18:48,358 --> 01:18:49,730
万事拜托
Thanks for doing this.

1021
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:52,070
别开玩笑了！
You gotta be kidding me.

1022
01:19:04,067 --> 01:19:06,014
欢迎回到伦敦，先生
Welcome back to London, sir. Thank you, sir.

1023
01:19:44,232 --> 01:19:46,917
告诉老家伙，敢威胁她就死定了
You tell the old man he threatens her again, I'll put it between his eyes.

1024
01:19:47,051 --> 01:19:48,902
哈里斯，在影片中他说
Harris, the pilot, on his film he said

1025
01:19:49,037 --> 01:19:51,549
是别的士兵杀了我哥
another soldier killed my brother.

1026
01:19:51,684 --> 01:19:54,858
他是想误导我们，他认为那很好玩
He was winding us up. He thought it was some kind of a joke!

1027
01:19:54,858 --> 01:19:56,747
这书刚刚出版

作者曾在特种部队服役

1029
01:20:00,938 --> 01:20:03,326
他说他曾埋伏杀死部落领袖
He describes an ambush where he killed a guerilla leader.

1030
01:20:04,870 --> 01:20:06,980
哈里斯没杀胡笙
Harris did not kill Hussain.

1031
01:20:10,692 --> 01:20:14,528
你胡乱给个名字，就说他有罪
You gave me his name. You said he was guilty.

1032
01:20:16,072 --> 01:20:17,635
那是阿拉的旨意
Such is Allah's will.

1033
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:20,253
阿拉个头！
Allah's will?

1034
01:20:20,388 --> 01:20:22,689
你让我杀了一个无辜的人
You had me kill an innocent man.

1035
01:20:23,179 --> 01:20:26,756
这本书是真正凶手的自白
The book will be the real killer's confession.

1036
01:20:27,724 --> 01:20:29,278
现在我父亲需要！
My father...

1037
01:20:29,671 --> 01:20:32,059
我知道你父亲需要什么
I know what your father needs.

1038
01:20:43,654 --> 01:20:45,956
我要洛夫芬宁的所有资讯
I need everything you can get on a Ranulph Fiennes.

1039
01:20:46,090 --> 01:20:48,507
对，作家，前特种队员
Yeah, writer, ex-SAS.

1040
01:20:58,596 --> 01:21:00,677
精准旅行，需要我效劳吗？

1041
01:21:02,538 --> 01:21:03,334
你找到什么？
What you got?

1042
01:21:03,947 --> 01:21:05,405
我找到芬宁
I got Fiennes.

1043
01:21:05,635 --> 01:21:07,908
他还在阿曼促销他的书

他星期二要开媒体茶会
He'll be doing a press bash on Tuesday.

1045
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:13,250
星期二？
Tuesday. I know it's a bit short notice,

1046
01:21:13,384 --> 01:21:16,070
时间有点短，人不好找
but I'll be able to put a crew together. Nah.

1047
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:19,110
不用，我自己来
I'll do this on my own.

1048
01:21:19,589 --> 01:21:22,562
你确定？我打几通电话…
Danny, are you sure? It's just a phone call.

1049
01:21:23,915 --> 01:21:25,823
我想他上钩了
I guess he's sure.

1050
01:21:29,928 --> 01:21:33,121
宾他妈的果
B-I-N-G fucking O.

1051
01:21:34,023 --> 01:21:36,737
我就知道能找到你，混帐东西
I knew I'd find you, you bastard.

1052
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:54,489
我能坐下吗？
Do you mind if I sit down?

1053
01:21:55,659 --> 01:21:56,253
你看起来很孤单
You look lonely.

1054
01:21:56,388 --> 01:21:57,730
你是丹尼的朋友
You're Danny's friend.

1055
01:21:59,111 --> 01:22:00,540
有名的杭特
The famous Hunter.

1056
01:22:00,684 --> 01:22:01,921
他有说我好话吗？
He say nice things?

1057
01:22:02,056 --> 01:22:03,465
你在这里干嘛？
What are you doing here?

1058
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:05,575
照顾你
Watching you.

1059
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:06,784
你该跟着他
You should be with him.

1060
01:22:06,918 --> 01:22:09,287
我试过，没用
I tried. It didn't work.

1061
01:22:09,411 --> 01:22:11,071
他要我保护你
He wanted me here to protect you.

1062
01:22:11,205 --> 01:22:12,768
而你看来也需要被保护
And you look like you needed protecting.

1063
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:14,370
保护什么？
From what?

1064
01:22:14,667 --> 01:22:16,221
你
You.

1065
01:22:17,477 --> 01:22:20,958
你认为他不会回来，还有未来的事
You're thinking about him not coming back. What happens then?

1066
01:22:21,994 --> 01:22:22,378
没有，我…
No, I...

1067
01:22:22,502 --> 01:22:24,775
我有老婆，我知道那个表情
I have a wife, I know the look.

我和丹尼患难相知
We've known each other through thick and thin, Danny and I.

1069
01:22:29,484 --> 01:22:32,994
我老婆琳赛爱他，我的孩子们爱他
Celine, my wife, she loves him, my kids love him.

1070
01:22:33,128 --> 01:22:35,171
连小狗也爱丹尼
I mean, wild animals like Danny.

1071
01:22:38,087 --> 01:22:40,455
我知道丹尼会为了你回来
I know Danny's going to come back for you.

1072
01:22:41,539 --> 01:22:44,723
等他回来，你就会夺走他
And when he does, you're going to steal him away. Huh?

1073
01:22:45,001 --> 01:22:46,622
我不知道这是怎样
I don't know what the plan is.

1074
01:22:48,876 --> 01:22:49,921
先生

1075
01:22:50,919 --> 01:22:51,647
是，先生

1076
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,438
- 来一瓶红酒吧？ - 马上来

1077
01:22:54,573 --> 01:22:56,989
我现在要审讯一名女性
I have a woman to interrogate now.

1078
01:23:02,571 --> 01:23:04,000
好，不错嘛
PENNOCK: All right, look alive, lads.

1079
01:23:04,134 --> 01:23:05,084
各位
Boys.

1080
01:23:06,119 --> 01:23:07,846
这家伙很行，非常厉害
So this guy is good. Very good.

1081
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:09,629
惊觉有状况，就会落跑
If he senses something's up,

1082
01:23:09,764 --> 01:23:11,260
碰到他，马上反击
he'll run until you corner him and then he fights.

1083
01:23:11,404 --> 01:23:13,159
毫不留情的攻击
But now the gloves are off.

1084
01:23:13,283 --> 01:23:14,712
今天就是他的忌日
This all fucking ends today.

1085
01:23:14,827 --> 01:23:16,314
好了，大家都知道规矩
MARTIN: All right, everybody knows the rules.

1086
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:17,954
就是不守规矩！
MAN: There are no rules.

1087
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:52,220
他从前门进来，大鱼入网
MAN: Boss, he's out front. I think we're on.

1088
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:02,175
黑皮衣，应该是他
This could be him. Black leathers.

1089
01:24:02,501 --> 01:24:03,518
知道了
Roger that.

1090
01:24:17,414 --> 01:24:19,045
他刚走买梯，肯定就是
He just took the service stairs. It has to be him.

1091
01:24:19,179 --> 01:24:21,922
别轻举妄动，很快就知道了
Just hold your positions. We'll know soon enough.

1092
01:24:49,993 --> 01:24:50,751
他昏倒了，我们逮到他了
He's down, boss. We got him! He stays alive.

1093
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:54,002
留活口，我到之前别碰他
Pennock, don't you touch him until I'm there.

1094
01:24:54,472 --> 01:24:55,268
待在那里
Stay here.

1095
01:25:01,127 --> 01:25:02,470
别乱动，混蛋
Stay there, you fucker.

1096
01:25:04,331 --> 01:25:06,019
拿掉他的安全帽
Get his helmet off before he chokes.

1097
01:25:12,137 --> 01:25:13,279
该死！
Shit.

1098
01:25:15,945 --> 01:25:17,920
手举高！靠着墙
Hands high, against the wall.

1099
01:25:20,903 --> 01:25:22,533
好，别乱来
Okay, easy with that.

1100
01:26:00,684 --> 01:26:02,755
各位，我们的人挂了！他在屋顶
Guys, our man's down. Head for the roof.

1101
01:26:29,417 --> 01:26:31,009
潘纳！右边屋顶
Pennock, head for the roof.

1102
01:26:31,786 --> 01:26:33,157
正准备上去，老板
We're on our way up now, boss.

1103
01:26:33,636 --> 01:26:34,835
头！快点！
Come on, move!

1104
01:26:58,917 --> 01:27:00,931
他跳楼！到别栋了！
He jumped! He jumped!

1105
01:27:31,141 --> 01:27:33,087
快点！他逃了，快点！
PENNOCK: Come on, come on, he's on the move. Let's go!

1106
01:28:16,839 --> 01:28:17,731
潘纳？
SPIKE: Pennock?

1107
01:28:19,812 --> 01:28:21,126
别声张！
Don't you do it.

1108
01:28:23,878 --> 01:28:25,672
他不在上面
PENNOCK: There's no sign of him up here, boss.

1109
01:28:25,796 --> 01:28:29,393
这边只有河，他消失了
I can see all the way to the river. He's gone.

1110
01:28:40,393 --> 01:28:41,256
该死
Shit.

1111
01:28:42,723 --> 01:28:44,421
敢乱动，你就死了
Move and you're dead.

1112
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:48,641
好了，快点
Right, let's go, let's go.

1113
01:28:52,419 --> 01:28:53,503
进去
Get in.

1114
01:29:13,413 --> 01:29:14,726
怎么会这样？
What is this?

1115
01:29:17,671 --> 01:29:18,985
那是为了坎贝
PENNOCK: That's for Campbell.

1116
01:29:21,219 --> 01:29:21,823
还有为了克雷格
And that's for Cregg.

1117
01:29:21,958 --> 01:29:23,482
你玩够没？
SPIKE: You finished?

1118
01:29:24,643 --> 01:29:26,024
我们根本还没开始
We haven't even started.

1119
01:29:26,149 --> 01:29:27,424
把罩子拿掉
Take the hood off.

1120
01:29:29,476 --> 01:29:31,136
在外面等着
Wait outside, boys.

1121
01:29:35,691 --> 01:29:37,408
留一点给我们，老板
Save a little bit for us, boss.

1122
01:29:40,745 --> 01:29:43,296
他为何还活着？为何没杀他？
So why is he still alive? Why didn't you kill him?

1123
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:46,020
那是你会做的事
Is that what you would have done?

1124
01:29:46,825 --> 01:29:48,446
你们这群伪君子
I thought you were the good guys.

1125
01:29:48,581 --> 01:29:52,062
你又是谁？为谁效命？
Who are you? Who do you work for?

1126
01:29:52,714 --> 01:29:54,210
你我有很多共通点
You and I got a lot in common.

1127
01:29:54,344 --> 01:29:56,800
真的？你这么想？
Really? You think so?

1128
01:29:56,934 --> 01:29:59,389
但你被绑在椅子上
So, you're sitting there, tied to a chair

1129
01:29:59,523 --> 01:30:01,892
而我手上拿着枪
and I'm standing here with a gun in my hand.

1130
01:30:02,026 --> 01:30:05,469
请你告诉我这是怎么回事！
Now you tell me what the fuck this was all about.

1131
01:30:06,726 --> 01:30:08,039
怎么回事？
"Was?"

1132
01:30:09,507 --> 01:30:11,070
以为这样就能结束？
You think this is over?

1133
01:30:11,204 --> 01:30:12,931
能什么事？
There'll be somebody else.

1134
01:30:13,065 --> 01:30:14,973
你的人还有芬宁，全死定了！
Your boy, Fiennes, is gonna die.

1135
01:30:24,391 --> 01:30:27,393
扣板机吧，杀了我他也难活
Go on, pull the trigger. Kill me and you kill Fiennes.

1136
01:30:27,527 --> 01:30:28,640
他们没找到他是不会罢休的
They won't stop till they get him.

1137
01:30:28,774 --> 01:30:30,299
我能阻止你，也能阻止他们
I stopped you, I'll stop them.

1138
01:30:30,443 --> 01:30:34,145
我并不想杀他，但他们很想
I didn't want to kill him. They will.

1139
01:30:35,305 --> 01:30:37,693
把那交给对的人，这事就结束了
You put that in the right hands, this thing's over.

1140
01:30:37,827 --> 01:30:38,978
照片？为什么？
The camera? Why?

1141
01:30:39,112 --> 01:30:42,594
证明，他死了的证据
Proof. Evidence that he's dead.

1142
01:30:44,042 --> 01:30:45,950
这是唯一救他的办法
It's the only way you'll save him.

1143
01:30:46,986 --> 01:30:50,333
放我走，我就告诉你幕后指使者
You tell me I'll walk, I'll tell you who's behind this and where to find him.

1144
01:30:52,491 --> 01:30:56,078
好，你走
Okay. You walk.

1145
01:30:57,574 --> 01:30:59,713
以萨酋长
Sheikh Amr bin Issa.

1146
01:31:00,039 --> 01:31:01,496
你能在阿曼找到他
You'll find him in Oman.

1147
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:02,503
为什么？
Why?

1148
01:31:02,628 --> 01:31:03,645
石油掠夺！
The war.

1149
01:31:05,639 --> 01:31:07,327
他们杀了他三个儿子
They killed three of his sons.

1150
01:31:14,117 --> 01:31:15,076
休想
No.

1151
01:31:23,305 --> 01:31:25,031
人还真好啊！
Some good guy, eh?

1152
01:31:32,329 --> 01:31:33,442
别动！
Drop it.

1153
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:41,565
进去
Inside.

1154
01:31:48,230 --> 01:31:50,801
在他旁边，跪下
Beside him. On your knees.

1155
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:02,760
你被陷害了
You were set up.

1156
01:32:02,884 --> 01:32:04,774
这就是我们喜欢你的原因
That's what we love about you lot.

1157
01:32:05,416 --> 01:32:07,459
你只在乎行动
You only care about the action.

1158
01:32:07,881 --> 01:32:13,194
从没想过为何或为谁而战
Never think about what you might really be fighting for. Or who.

1159
01:32:14,662 --> 01:32:16,771
不深入调查内幕
Never see the big picture.

1160
01:32:21,221 --> 01:32:26,007
被陷害的是你，他只是绊脚石
You're the one that was set up. He just wouldn't get out of the way.

1161
01:32:27,235 --> 01:32:30,553
女王陛下不喜欢秘密组织
Her Majesty's government doesn't like secret societies.

1162
01:32:31,397 --> 01:32:33,852
特别是阻挡我们利益的组织
Particularly when they get in the way of our interests.

1163
01:32:34,955 --> 01:32:37,803
知道那烂沙漠里蕴涵多少石油吗？
Do you know how much oil that pathetic crust of desert is floating on?

1164
01:32:39,434 --> 01:32:40,383
开采出来后市值多少钱吗？
Do you know what those contracts are worth?

1165
01:32:40,517 --> 01:32:41,946
三条人命
Three men's lives.

1166
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:43,433
可不是吗
That's right.

1167
01:32:45,034 --> 01:32:45,993
不错
That's right.

1168
01:32:46,569 --> 01:32:47,547
所以我们送杀手进去
We deliver the killers.

1169
01:32:47,691 --> 01:32:49,283
只要等小儿子回家
Son Number 4 goes home

1170
01:32:49,417 --> 01:32:53,407
石油顺利开采，我们就能获利
and when Sheikhy re-ups the contracts, we get favorable consideration.

1171
01:32:54,279 --> 01:32:55,651
你这个混蛋！你…
A bargain. You bastard, you're a...

1172
01:32:55,785 --> 01:32:57,061
这叫爱国
Patriot.

1173
01:32:57,195 --> 01:33:00,130
那三个死人为国效命
Who serves his country as those three men did with their deaths.

1174
01:33:00,839 --> 01:33:02,115
你将追随他们
As you will with yours.

1175
01:33:57,547 --> 01:33:58,717
我的妈呀！
(WOMAN SCREAMS)

1176
01:34:01,192 --> 01:34:01,853
怎样？

1177
01:34:10,667 --> 01:34:11,645
回来！

1178
01:34:28,265 --> 01:34:29,666
她在那里
AGENT: There she is.

1179
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:31,775
丹尼漏掉的小绵羊
Danny might've dropped off the radar,

1180
01:34:31,910 --> 01:34:35,688
但有件事很确定，他会回来找她
but one thing's for sure. He'll come back for her.

1181
01:34:35,813 --> 01:34:38,335
他会带着六百万来赎她
He'll come through that door with $6 million

1182
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:40,512
而她将会消失
and she won't be there.

1183
01:34:40,647 --> 01:34:44,886
一成的佣金！别忘了
Who don't you screw out of his 10%? Yours truly.

1184
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:47,235
老板
Boss.

1185
01:34:51,465 --> 01:34:52,443
处理他
Deal with him.

1186
01:36:06,116 --> 01:36:10,077
这无关个人恩怨，纯粹生意
It wasn't personal. Just business.

1187
01:36:11,429 --> 01:36:15,457
你竟敢耍我们，追究原因
You played us. I don't care why.

1188
01:36:15,592 --> 01:36:18,660
要是真有需要宰掉谁，肯定你
But if ever a lying piece of shit needed killing, it was you.

1189
01:36:22,890 --> 01:36:23,782
任务结束
Game's over.

1190
01:36:23,906 --> 01:36:25,220
你知道我不会伤害她
You know, I wouldn't have hurt her.

1191
01:36:26,122 --> 01:36:28,970
我只要我的钱，她只是担保品
I just wanted my cut. She was only collateral.

1192
01:36:36,873 --> 01:36:38,330
你敢再找他们
If you go after them,

1193
01:36:39,203 --> 01:36:43,787
我会找到你，用尽一切方法
I'll find you. Remember, everybody gets found.

1194
01:36:43,787 --> 01:36:45,379
砍你人头！
Even you.

1195
01:36:59,851 --> 01:37:00,858
你把照片给那个老混蛋
HUNTER: You gotta get those photos to that old bastard

1196
01:37:01,002 --> 01:37:03,515
然后了结这一切？
to finish this thing for good, you hear, kiddo?

1197
01:37:03,659 --> 01:37:06,123
所以我才来，你呢？
That's why I'm here. What about you?

1198
01:37:06,315 --> 01:37:07,802
保母生涯结束
Babysitting's over, kiddo.

1199
01:37:09,221 --> 01:37:09,691
谁说的？
Who says? I say.

1200
01:37:09,835 --> 01:37:12,223
她很安全，现在换照顾你
She's safe. You're the one taking the chances now.

1201
01:37:12,357 --> 01:37:12,894
拜托
Come on. "Come on?"

1202
01:37:13,028 --> 01:37:15,138
拜托？你上次就踏入了陷阱
You walked into a trap last time.

1203
01:37:15,138 --> 01:37:16,961
你以为我还会让你这么做吗？
You think I'm going to let you do that again?

1204
01:37:17,095 --> 01:37:18,687
我跟你女朋友说过你会回来
I told your girl you were going to be coming back to her.

1205
01:37:18,821 --> 01:37:19,713
你要害我变成骗子吗？
You want to make a liar out of me?

1206
01:37:19,847 --> 01:37:22,600
你应该要保护她，不是访问她
You know, you were supposed to be guarding her, not interviewing her.

1207
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:25,247
我很爱跟美女搭讪，这我不否认
Well, I was always a sucker for a pretty face, no denying that.

1208
01:37:25,381 --> 01:37:27,836
但她啥都没说，口风很紧
She's a keeper, that's for sure.

1209
01:37:28,939 --> 01:37:30,627
她并不知道内幕吧？
She doesn't know, does she?

1210
01:37:30,761 --> 01:37:31,739
猜到一些
Some. Yeah.

1211
01:37:32,391 --> 01:37:32,929
事情会很难搞
It's going to be tough. My old man used to say,

1212
01:37:33,063 --> 01:37:36,160
我老爸说：人生就像玫瑰花
"Life's like licking honey from a thorn."

1213
01:37:36,458 --> 01:37:37,474
那是什么意思？
Yeah, what does that mean?

1214
01:37:37,609 --> 01:37:39,584
美丽却带刺
Something about good times and bad times.

1215
01:37:39,719 --> 01:37:42,720
看来我们遇上的都是野玫瑰
Seems like it's been all thorns for us lately. Both of us.

1216
01:37:42,855 --> 01:37:44,226
好，是该做个了断
All right, let's finish this.

1217
01:37:44,907 --> 01:37:46,144
我掩护你
I'll be top cover.

1218
01:37:46,278 --> 01:37:48,283
要是有状况，我就冲进去
Anything goes wrong,

1219
01:37:48,427 --> 01:37:51,208
酋长想完结此事，送照片后就走
I'm coming in. Hey, look, the Sheikh wants this over. It's in, hand over the photos, and out.

1220
01:37:51,237 --> 01:37:51,707
是吗？
Yeah? Yeah.

1221
01:37:51,850 --> 01:37:53,701
对，不会有问题的
There isn't going to be a problem.

1222
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:56,224
要保持警觉
From your mouth to God's ears.

1223
01:37:56,358 --> 01:37:58,727
听我号令，别轻举妄动
Don't move till I give the all-clear, okay?

1224
01:38:18,243 --> 01:38:21,513
你是谁？你要什么？
BAKHAIT: Who are you? What do you want?

1225
01:38:24,132 --> 01:38:25,474
给酋长的
For the Sheikh.

1226
01:38:27,143 --> 01:38:29,416
我要看到他亲自拿到手
I have to see it placed in his hands.

1227
01:38:41,193 --> 01:38:43,332
把这些拿回部落
Take these to my people.

1228
01:38:43,466 --> 01:38:45,883
给他们看我赢回荣耀
Show them what I have done.

1229
01:38:48,136 --> 01:38:49,863
我想跟酋长说说话
I have a message for the Sheikh.

1230
01:38:56,202 --> 01:38:57,986
他还活着
He's still alive.

1231
01:39:01,381 --> 01:39:02,762
你上当了
They're fakes.

1232
01:39:06,090 --> 01:39:07,461
你在地狱找不到他
But this is going to end.

1233
01:39:21,828 --> 01:39:23,295
死了也罢！
I don't care.

1234
01:39:25,731 --> 01:39:31,437
我不在乎，谁想回去那个烂沙漠
What'll I do in that godforsaken desert?

1235
01:39:36,808 --> 01:39:38,563
你是不是忘了什么？
Haven't you forgotten something?

1236
01:39:55,145 --> 01:39:56,554
等等，先别动
HUNTER: Hold it, hold it, stay where you are.

1237
01:39:56,679 --> 01:39:58,137
有状况
Something's not right here.

1238
01:40:05,828 --> 01:40:06,941
你看到了吗？
You seeing this?

1239
01:40:07,075 --> 01:40:08,255
我看到了
Yeah, I see it.

1240
01:40:14,469 --> 01:40:16,032
看来我们晚了一步
So we're in the wrong place.

1241
01:40:34,599 --> 01:40:35,578
上车，我们走
HUNTER: Let's go! Let's go!

1242
01:41:14,850 --> 01:41:16,414
安啦！只有车子受伤而已
Relax, I only killed the car.

1243
01:41:58,151 --> 01:41:59,264
又是你
You again!

1244
01:42:08,039 --> 01:42:11,721
在宫殿里，发生什么事？
Back at the palace, what happened in there?

1245
01:42:12,805 --> 01:42:15,040
他在那里，等你的信息
He was there, waiting for a message from you.

1246
01:42:15,174 --> 01:42:16,737
而我就是信差
I was the messenger.

1247
01:42:16,871 --> 01:42:17,917
然后呢？
And?

1248
01:42:18,051 --> 01:42:19,298
还能怎样！
What do you think?

1249
01:42:20,008 --> 01:42:22,789
他儿子根本不在乎，他不想回沙漠
His boy in there didn't give a shit.

1250
01:42:22,923 --> 01:42:25,023
所以不会有什么石油工程动工
He's not going back to the desert, so there'll be no oil contracts.

1251
01:42:26,088 --> 01:42:27,709
一切全都是徒劳无功
It was all for nothing.

1252
01:42:27,843 --> 01:42:29,310
原来如此！
Is that right?

1253
01:42:41,442 --> 01:42:43,005
这是赢家礼物…
And the winner is.

1254
01:42:44,070 --> 01:42:45,480
这就是你们要的？
So that's what this is all about.

1255
01:42:45,604 --> 01:42:48,098
对，精彩的现在才要开始
Yeah, it's all hookers and blow from here on in.

1256
01:42:48,712 --> 01:42:50,620
你就是不懂，对吧？
You just don't get it, do you?

1257
01:42:53,027 --> 01:42:53,727
别拿它！
Ditch it.

1258
01:42:53,862 --> 01:42:55,233
你确定？
You sure?

1259
01:42:55,626 --> 01:42:57,218
全丢掉
Ditch it.

1260
01:42:58,858 --> 01:43:00,680
这是俘虏的补偿
I gotta cover my expenses.

1261
01:43:02,570 --> 01:43:03,874
你不能回英国
You can't go back to England.

1262
01:43:04,008 --> 01:43:05,188
杀了那特务后更不行
Not after killing that spook.

1263
01:43:05,322 --> 01:43:06,435
你到底是谁？
Who the fuck are you?

1264
01:43:06,569 --> 01:43:08,871
我是您老师！经验之谈
Who, me? The voice of experience.

1265
01:43:08,995 --> 01:43:09,561
你打算要去哪？
Where are you going to go?

1266
01:43:09,705 --> 01:43:10,817
你打算做什么？
What are you going to do?

1267
01:43:10,952 --> 01:43:11,844
你会需要这个
You're going to need this.

1268
01:43:12,457 --> 01:43:14,759
新名字、新脸孔、新的人生
New name, new face, new papers.

1269
01:43:14,884 --> 01:43:17,157
很贵的，你等着瞧吧
Expensive. You'll see.

1270
01:43:26,114 --> 01:43:27,524
真浪费！
Damn shame.

1271
01:43:31,427 --> 01:43:33,221
你们以为可以就这么走人？
You think you get to just walk away?

1272
01:43:34,084 --> 01:43:35,609
没人能走
Nobody walks away.

1273
01:43:36,299 --> 01:43:38,783
我、你 都逃不了
Not me or you, none of us.

1274
01:43:39,397 --> 01:43:41,190
你刚杀死的老家伙
The old man you just killed,

1275
01:43:42,312 --> 01:43:43,329
他说除非双边同意
he told me a war isn't over

1276
01:43:43,463 --> 01:43:45,247
战争才会结束
until both sides say it is.

1277
01:43:45,381 --> 01:43:47,875
但对我而言还没结束
Well, I'm telling you now, this is over for me.

1278
01:43:48,009 --> 01:43:51,490
你要我说什么？祝你幸福吗？
Really? And what? You want me to say, "Me, too," and then it's happy ever after?

1279
01:43:51,625 --> 01:43:52,862
随你便！
Your choice.

1280
01:43:52,996 --> 01:43:55,010
他们宣称这场战争已结束
You know, when I got this, they told me my war was over.

1281
01:43:55,144 --> 01:43:58,271
都是在鬼扯，你自己小心！
I told them they were full of shit. Now I'm telling it to you.

1282
01:43:58,597 --> 01:44:00,122
快滚吧！
Let it go.

1283
01:44:06,442 --> 01:44:07,717
你要去哪里？
So where are you going?

1284
01:44:08,005 --> 01:44:09,597
怎么？想来作客？
What, are you planning a visit?

1285
01:44:10,153 --> 01:44:11,553
这很难说
You never know.

1286
01:44:13,989 --> 01:44:17,020
你要是来，我会招待你
You come. I'll be waiting.

1287
01:44:22,985 --> 01:44:24,923
我们会在机场帮你叫车
We'll call you a cab from the airport.

1288
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:50,471
你是安吗？穿怪怪雨鞋的那个？
Aren't you Anne Frazer? The girl with those weird gumboots?

1289
01:44:52,418 --> 01:44:54,499
你是丹尼，落跑的那个？
Are you Danny Bryce, the boy who went away?

1290
01:44:54,634 --> 01:44:57,635
对，我回来了
Yeah. I'm back.

1291
01:44:58,115 --> 01:44:59,295
你要去哪？
Where you headed?

1292
01:45:00,388 --> 01:45:01,663
漫无目的…
I don't know.

1293
01:45:01,798 --> 01:45:04,761
我也是，要一起走吗？
Me, neither. Want to come along?

1294
01:45:30,569 --> 01:45:32,353
电影改编自 菲恩斯博士

1295
01:45:32,487 --> 01:45:34,721
“羽毛人The Feather Man”

1296
01:45:34,856 --> 01:45:35,652
真实故事，口述撰写

1297
01:45:35,786 --> 01:45:37,311
出版当时

1298
01:45:37,445 --> 01:45:41,607
引起诸多争议与政府不满

1299
01:45:42,183 --> 01:45:45,309
当时参与阿曼战争的英国航特部队

1300
01:45:45,444 --> 01:45:47,419
是掠夺资源还是正义申张

1301
01:45:47,563 --> 01:45:50,459
至今仍对此任务保持高度机密

1302
01:45:51,332 --> 01:45:54,430
丹尼和史派基探员

1303
01:45:54,564 --> 01:45:57,412
目前行踪仍然不明。
