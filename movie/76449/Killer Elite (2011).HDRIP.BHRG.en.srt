1
00:01:26,531 --> 00:01:28,089
Hey kiddo, what are you doing?

2
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:31,568
I buy you a fancy Mexican meal
and you're feeding it to a mutt.

3
00:01:32,136 --> 00:01:33,501
Real fancy.

4
00:01:35,006 --> 00:01:36,701
Have you any idea what that is?

5
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:37,764
What?

6
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:39,433
- Tree chicken.
- What?

7
00:01:39,577 --> 00:01:40,703
That's what the locals call it.

8
00:01:42,146 --> 00:01:45,775
Colds, headaches, hangovers.
Cures anything.

9
00:01:45,883 --> 00:01:48,317
Iguana. That's what they say.

10
00:01:48,453 --> 00:01:50,182
What about indigestion?

11
00:01:51,055 --> 00:01:53,785
Fucking iguana taco.

12
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:58,224
Yeah well, you had it in Salvador.

13
00:01:58,362 --> 00:02:00,159
Yeah, and that was shit.

14
00:02:00,798 --> 00:02:02,857
What about Angola?
The food was good there right?

15
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,092
Shit.

16
00:02:04,235 --> 00:02:05,827
Yeah? Rhodesia?

17
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,402
Shit.

18
00:02:06,537 --> 00:02:08,471
- Hamburg?
- Shit.

19
00:02:08,773 --> 00:02:10,104
So if it's not New York it's...

20
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:11,503
You got it. Shit.

21
00:02:11,642 --> 00:02:13,576
Look at you wasting away.

22
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:15,674
We got to get a job in New York.

23
00:02:15,813 --> 00:02:18,281
That won't be a problem.
Plenty of assholes there.

24
00:02:20,518 --> 00:02:22,008
Time to move kiddo.

25
00:02:48,246 --> 00:02:49,873
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:35,121
Oops.

27
00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:52,731
Fuck!

28
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,412
Stay down!

29
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:11,847
Stay down kid!

30
00:05:30,508 --> 00:05:31,167
What happened?!

31
00:05:31,309 --> 00:05:32,503
- There was a kid in the car.
- What?!

32
00:05:32,643 --> 00:05:33,473
There was a kid in the car.

33
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:34,600
Go, go, go, go!

34
00:05:34,745 --> 00:05:35,712
Fuck!

35
00:05:49,927 --> 00:05:53,488
I'm done with this. I'm finished.

36
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,800
I can't do this anymore.

37
00:06:00,237 --> 00:06:02,296
I can't do this.

38
00:07:06,036 --> 00:07:07,469
Oh, shit!

39
00:07:18,549 --> 00:07:19,846
Shit.

40
00:07:41,405 --> 00:07:42,133
Danny, get in.

41
00:07:42,673 --> 00:07:45,665
These camel-jockeys have got diseases
I don't want to think about.

42
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:46,799
Where is he?

43
00:07:46,944 --> 00:07:48,138
The Client still has him.

44
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,507
What Client?

45
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,645
We're going there now.

46
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,607
Okay, drive.

47
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,889
So the client's an oil sheikh, no less.

48
00:08:04,028 --> 00:08:05,290
Used to rule some huge stretch

49
00:08:05,429 --> 00:08:07,693
of desert 'til his tribe kicked him out.

50
00:08:07,832 --> 00:08:10,232
Been living here in exile ever since.

51
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:14,133
Anyway, sheikhy was loaded
and he wanted a job done.

52
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:16,671
Hunter took the contract, then he ran.

53
00:08:16,807 --> 00:08:18,775
They caught him at the airport.

54
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:20,977
And?

55
00:08:21,412 --> 00:08:24,438
You know the rest. You got the package.

56
00:08:25,015 --> 00:08:28,451
Yeah, I got it. What's the job?

57
00:08:28,586 --> 00:08:32,022
It just came with a price tag
no details. Hunter took it cold.

58
00:08:32,156 --> 00:08:33,555
Why would he do that?

59
00:08:33,691 --> 00:08:37,183
Six million dollars. A big score, Danny.

60
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:39,023
Too bloody big for Hunter.

61
00:08:39,163 --> 00:08:41,324
Yeah. Well, why'd you offer it to him.

62
00:08:41,465 --> 00:08:45,162
He wanted the money and you were out.
Remember?

63
00:08:45,302 --> 00:08:47,429
Yeah. Still am.

64
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,131
I'm done with killing.

65
00:08:50,274 --> 00:08:52,742
Yeah well maybe killing ain't done
with you.

66
00:08:53,043 --> 00:08:55,910
Hunter needs the old Danny,
the best in the biz.

67
00:08:56,046 --> 00:08:57,377
The one with balls of steel.

68
00:08:57,515 --> 00:08:59,380
You remember him, right.

69
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:01,451
Look, it comes down to this...

70
00:09:01,585 --> 00:09:05,544
you don't do this job,
Hunter's a dead man.

71
00:09:12,196 --> 00:09:13,857
They're waiting for you.

72
00:10:02,413 --> 00:10:03,846
This way.

73
00:10:04,481 --> 00:10:06,813
He is waiting for his eyes to adjust.

74
00:10:08,218 --> 00:10:10,652
Be careful around this one, boy.

75
00:10:14,224 --> 00:10:17,318
My son forgets the ways of the desert.

76
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:19,622
Since our war against the Sultan,

77
00:10:19,763 --> 00:10:24,700
all he has had of his homeland is
this paint. Plaster.

78
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,500
My first son, Hussein,
was slaughtered here.

79
00:10:35,212 --> 00:10:37,237
Shot before his children.

80
00:10:38,782 --> 00:10:40,909
And here, at the battle of Mirbat

81
00:10:41,051 --> 00:10:46,990
his brother, Salim, was wounded
and then killed. Murdered.

82
00:10:50,394 --> 00:10:54,922
And then my third son was taken
from me. Ali.

83
00:10:58,869 --> 00:11:01,429
Hunted down and slaughtered.

84
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,134
The law of the desert says
the blood of the victim

85
00:11:06,276 --> 00:11:09,370
must be washed away
by the blood of the killers,

86
00:11:09,513 --> 00:11:11,276
but I refused revenge

87
00:11:11,415 --> 00:11:14,646
and saved my last son,
Bakhait, from the war.

88
00:11:14,785 --> 00:11:17,652
So I was exiled to this desert.

89
00:11:18,355 --> 00:11:21,552
I have wealth, power

90
00:11:22,793 --> 00:11:24,954
but rich men die too.

91
00:11:25,462 --> 00:11:27,020
When I die,

92
00:11:27,531 --> 00:11:30,432
I want Bakhait to go home to my tribe.

93
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:31,499
But for that to happen,

94
00:11:31,635 --> 00:11:34,695
the killers of my sons must be killed.

95
00:11:35,606 --> 00:11:37,904
You don't need me or Hunter for this.

96
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:39,669
You've got all the men you need.

97
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,335
What use would my men be in England?

98
00:11:43,347 --> 00:11:44,678
England?

99
00:11:46,884 --> 00:11:48,852
The English sent their fiercest dogs

100
00:11:48,986 --> 00:11:51,318
to kill for a Sultan's oil!

101
00:11:52,723 --> 00:11:53,621
The SAS?

102
00:11:53,757 --> 00:11:57,659
Yes, their glorious special forces.

103
00:11:57,795 --> 00:11:58,557
It was a war!

104
00:11:58,696 --> 00:12:00,254
It was not England's war!

105
00:12:00,397 --> 00:12:05,892
They came to my land, murdered my sons,
now they will face my law!

106
00:12:07,071 --> 00:12:10,302
The doctors say
I have six months left to live.

107
00:12:10,441 --> 00:12:12,966
You must avenge my sons before I die,

108
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,305
or your friend will die with me.

109
00:12:15,446 --> 00:12:17,710
I don't care how you kill the killers,

110
00:12:17,848 --> 00:12:20,408
but they will admit their guilt on tape.

111
00:12:20,551 --> 00:12:24,112
And their deaths must look like
accidents.

112
00:12:24,254 --> 00:12:27,121
This must not lead back to my son.

113
00:12:27,357 --> 00:12:28,415
So go.

114
00:12:29,727 --> 00:12:35,029
Show the English a war isn't over
'til both sides say it is.

115
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,596
I want to see Hunter.

116
00:12:53,383 --> 00:12:55,943
Oh, Danny,

117
00:12:56,086 --> 00:12:59,351
no Danny, no, no, no, no.

118
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,822
What are you doing here?
Get out of here.

119
00:13:04,962 --> 00:13:05,690
You all right?

120
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:07,592
Am I all right? Yeah, I'm all right.

121
00:13:07,731 --> 00:13:10,393
You got to go. Get away from here.
Go, go, go, go.

122
00:13:10,534 --> 00:13:11,694
I'm not here for you anyway.

123
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:14,395
I was thinking about
the girls and Celine.

124
00:13:14,538 --> 00:13:16,472
Me too, me too.

125
00:13:17,574 --> 00:13:19,235
What's that supposed to mean?

126
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,076
It's tough putting food on the table.

127
00:13:22,212 --> 00:13:25,409
What are you feeding them?
Six million, no questions?

128
00:13:25,549 --> 00:13:26,174
Well.

129
00:13:26,316 --> 00:13:28,113
You must've known
that was a bullshit job.

130
00:13:28,252 --> 00:13:31,779
Yeah, I know. Fucking SAS,
a one-way ticket for sure.

131
00:13:32,856 --> 00:13:35,518
Well, you took the job
and I'm not leaving you here.

132
00:13:44,234 --> 00:13:45,997
Hey! Get this man a drink.

133
00:13:48,305 --> 00:13:49,237
I missed you.

134
00:13:49,373 --> 00:13:49,896
Well, I didn't miss you.

135
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,975
Every day you were out of this game
was a good day for me.

136
00:13:53,744 --> 00:13:55,609
I was proud of you when you got out.

137
00:13:57,214 --> 00:13:58,476
Stay out.

138
00:13:58,615 --> 00:13:59,775
Too late.

139
00:14:01,485 --> 00:14:03,385
You should have stayed away.

140
00:14:05,155 --> 00:14:07,089
Or run faster.

141
00:15:02,746 --> 00:15:04,441
Sonofabitch.

142
00:15:05,282 --> 00:15:07,546
What are you doing?
Let me get my watch back.

143
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:36,710
Go! Go!!

144
00:15:50,694 --> 00:15:52,025
Go! Go! Get the door.

145
00:15:52,963 --> 00:15:53,987
Get the door!

146
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:06,433
Give me the gun!

147
00:16:16,219 --> 00:16:18,119
Bravo. Bravo.

148
00:16:18,455 --> 00:16:21,549
If you need to be shot,
I'll happily oblige.

149
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:27,226
I'm sorry, kiddo.

150
00:16:27,364 --> 00:16:28,922
My father needs him alive.

151
00:16:34,838 --> 00:16:36,100
Nice try.

152
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:37,797
You know they'd have found you.

153
00:16:42,746 --> 00:16:44,008
Everybody gets found.

154
00:16:44,147 --> 00:16:44,943
Oh!

155
00:16:45,082 --> 00:16:46,606
Agh!

156
00:16:49,052 --> 00:16:50,178
You knew!

157
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,483
My gut tells me you knew the target
and you knew Hunter wouldn't take it!

158
00:16:53,623 --> 00:16:54,783
You used him as bait.

159
00:16:54,925 --> 00:16:55,892
That's a lot of angles,

160
00:16:56,026 --> 00:16:58,995
Danny. You think I'm that smart?

161
00:17:00,097 --> 00:17:01,291
Get out.

162
00:17:02,966 --> 00:17:04,729
And you, out.

163
00:17:29,226 --> 00:17:31,285
We missed you at the dance last night.

164
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:33,689
I'm not much of a dancer.

165
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,890
Besides, I'm still trying to find out
how much house is under this.

166
00:17:37,034 --> 00:17:38,695
Right. Big plans.

167
00:17:39,202 --> 00:17:40,931
Yeah, maybe too big.

168
00:17:48,445 --> 00:17:50,242
You don't remember me, do you?

169
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:53,679
Yeah, well. It's been a while.

170
00:17:55,452 --> 00:17:57,181
I'm Anne Frazer.

171
00:18:01,825 --> 00:18:03,383
Anne Frazer?

172
00:18:03,527 --> 00:18:04,926
Anne had red hair full of grass.

173
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:06,359
Yeah!

174
00:18:06,496 --> 00:18:08,157
And weird red gumboots.

175
00:18:08,298 --> 00:18:11,131
With eyes on them. Oh my God!

176
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:30,711
Oi, you owe me fifty quid.

177
00:18:30,854 --> 00:18:32,515
Told you he'd be back, didn't I?

178
00:18:35,358 --> 00:18:36,484
We missed you.

179
00:18:36,626 --> 00:18:39,561
Yeah? Well here I am.

180
00:18:40,163 --> 00:18:42,324
All right then, do you want some?

181
00:18:47,003 --> 00:18:48,061
Yeah, mate, you still got it.

182
00:18:48,205 --> 00:18:49,433
You still got that edge.

183
00:18:49,573 --> 00:18:50,938
You're a real killer!

184
00:18:55,812 --> 00:18:57,245
Come on, let's talk.

185
00:18:59,316 --> 00:19:01,614
While you were away,
you didn't start a family, did you?

186
00:19:01,751 --> 00:19:02,775
No.

187
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:04,716
So no one's depending on you.

188
00:19:04,855 --> 00:19:06,345
Only Hunter.

189
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,787
Only Hunter.

190
00:19:07,924 --> 00:19:09,516
Because one

191
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:11,718
you're going after the SAS.

192
00:19:11,862 --> 00:19:14,831
They're a paranoid bunch.
They've always got their back up.

193
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:17,058
Two. You need info on Oman.

194
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,100
No one talks about Oman.

195
00:19:19,236 --> 00:19:21,431
They went in there as advisers
and ended up fighting the fucking war.

196
00:19:21,571 --> 00:19:23,971
Real hush-hush, semi-mercenary stuff.

197
00:19:24,107 --> 00:19:26,200
Three. You need confessions.

198
00:19:26,343 --> 00:19:27,310
They're trained to resist torture,

199
00:19:27,444 --> 00:19:29,639
so no matter what you say or do,
they'll say nothing.

200
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:31,303
And four, Danny,

201
00:19:31,448 --> 00:19:33,507
this is the best Special Forces Regiment
in the world.

202
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:37,245
They make the Navy Seals look like
a bunch of cupcakes and not only that,

203
00:19:38,121 --> 00:19:39,748
you're trying to take down
three of their geezers

204
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,755
and make it look like an accident.

205
00:19:41,892 --> 00:19:44,258
All I'm asking is give it some thought.

206
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:47,821
Take a day, more if you want.
I'm going anyway.

207
00:19:49,266 --> 00:19:50,426
Course I'm in, you silly bastard.

208
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:52,034
It's what we do, right?

209
00:19:52,502 --> 00:19:54,902
Anyway, I got a score to settle
with them.

210
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:56,528
I tried out for them
when I was in the Paras.

211
00:19:56,673 --> 00:19:57,901
Did Hereford, the whole fucking lot!

212
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,475
What? And they wouldn't have you.

213
00:20:01,444 --> 00:20:03,674
You want this bottle shoved up your ass?

214
00:20:03,813 --> 00:20:05,838
Are you upset? Would you like a lolly?

215
00:20:05,949 --> 00:20:06,438
I'd love a lolly.

216
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,016
Strawberry, or fuck you?

217
00:20:08,151 --> 00:20:09,550
Meier.

218
00:20:10,554 --> 00:20:11,816
In.

219
00:20:11,955 --> 00:20:13,013
Why?

220
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,357
Ah, six million reasons.

221
00:20:15,492 --> 00:20:17,323
So what's the split?

222
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,328
After the Agent takes his slice,
fifty-fifty between you two.

223
00:20:21,464 --> 00:20:23,659
Fifty-fifty? How about you?

224
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,892
I'm in this for Hunter.

225
00:20:25,035 --> 00:20:26,468
How wonderfully touching.

226
00:20:26,603 --> 00:20:28,833
Touching but fucking stupid.

227
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,540
The Sheikh could only ID
one of the killers.

228
00:20:32,676 --> 00:20:34,974
I need you to come up
with the names on the other two.

229
00:20:35,111 --> 00:20:37,375
Start with the one
they killed at Mirbat.

230
00:20:37,514 --> 00:20:40,608
So the one target we do have is
Steven Douglas Harris.

231
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,342
He stayed on in Oman after the war.

232
00:20:42,485 --> 00:20:45,045
Ended up flying choppers for
the Sultan's armed forces.

233
00:20:45,188 --> 00:20:46,746
Great. A juice junkie.

234
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,120
Me and Meier will head there
to track him down.

235
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:51,227
Boys? Danny.

236
00:20:51,795 --> 00:20:53,285
Meier.

237
00:21:07,244 --> 00:21:09,178
What the fuck! Oh piss off!

238
00:21:12,182 --> 00:21:13,171
Piss off!

239
00:21:14,718 --> 00:21:16,083
It's Harris!

240
00:21:17,487 --> 00:21:20,854
Harris, you prick! Fuck off!

241
00:21:26,596 --> 00:21:29,190
Well, I hope the buggers like sand
in their burgers, huh?

242
00:21:34,938 --> 00:21:38,135
White Range Rover coming your way.
It's Harris.

243
00:22:01,197 --> 00:22:02,425
What are you doing?

244
00:22:05,001 --> 00:22:06,662
Come on, have a go.

245
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:07,428
No, I'm not.

246
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,368
Have a go. Look, just aim and shoot.

247
00:22:10,507 --> 00:22:12,168
Go! Here we go!

248
00:22:14,678 --> 00:22:15,940
Oh you horny git!

249
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:18,070
Come on! Come on!

250
00:23:30,653 --> 00:23:32,780
All right, ladies, you can throw
your knickers if you want!

251
00:23:32,922 --> 00:23:35,049
Go on, you cheeky bugger!

252
00:23:36,326 --> 00:23:37,623
You serve in Oman?

253
00:23:37,761 --> 00:23:40,457
That Mirbat. That was a day, wasn't it.

254
00:23:40,597 --> 00:23:42,724
What about Mirbat,
that was a right mess, eh.

255
00:23:42,866 --> 00:23:43,833
Wasn't good.

256
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:45,696
Had a mate there.

257
00:23:55,612 --> 00:23:57,512
Go on, get that, quick!
Yeah, all right. All right.

258
00:24:02,085 --> 00:24:02,881
Bollocks.

259
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,912
Hello?

260
00:24:05,054 --> 00:24:06,021
Spikey, it's Bazza.

261
00:24:06,156 --> 00:24:07,418
For God's sake.

262
00:24:07,557 --> 00:24:10,492
I'm unplugging that bloody thing
next time, and I mean it!

263
00:24:10,627 --> 00:24:12,788
Yeah, I'm on to this bloke here, right.

264
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:16,922
He was in the Bear earlier pumping
some SAS lads for info on Mirbat.

265
00:24:17,066 --> 00:24:18,090
Mirbat? And?

266
00:24:18,234 --> 00:24:20,566
He says he's Welsh
but he don't sound it.

267
00:24:20,703 --> 00:24:22,694
I don't know, maybe
I'm being a bit paranoid, but...

268
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:23,771
Hey, just because you're being paranoid,

269
00:24:23,907 --> 00:24:26,341
doesn't mean to say
they're not out to get you.

270
00:24:27,677 --> 00:24:31,078
All right mate, give me what you got.

271
00:24:31,214 --> 00:24:31,976
Okay.

272
00:24:32,148 --> 00:24:33,911
I'll put one of my Locals on to him.

273
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:04,569
The Omani Embassy.

274
00:25:04,714 --> 00:25:07,706
Our Local followed him
into the visa section.

275
00:25:08,151 --> 00:25:11,518
Says he's Welsh.
Calls himself Mr. Jones.

276
00:25:11,654 --> 00:25:13,144
We lost him after he left.

277
00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:14,722
Lost him. How come?

278
00:25:14,858 --> 00:25:16,883
He never came back to his car. Stolen.

279
00:25:17,026 --> 00:25:19,722
Anyhow, he flies to Oman in four days.

280
00:25:19,863 --> 00:25:22,923
I'd like permission to send
one of my boys out there to tail him.

281
00:25:23,066 --> 00:25:25,534
This was definitely some kind of recce.

282
00:25:25,668 --> 00:25:28,967
That was a dirty war.
What we did there was questionable.

283
00:25:29,105 --> 00:25:30,936
Oman is a bloody hornet's nest.

284
00:25:31,074 --> 00:25:33,099
Right. And if this bugger is
poking at it,

285
00:25:33,243 --> 00:25:34,471
I want to know who he is.

286
00:25:34,611 --> 00:25:37,307
I say we send a Local. Any objections?

287
00:25:37,447 --> 00:25:38,277
Noted.

288
00:25:38,414 --> 00:25:39,745
We'll leave you to choose the right man.

289
00:25:39,883 --> 00:25:43,375
I'd also like it noted
that we are ex-SAS.

290
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,454
The men we protect are ex-SAS.

291
00:25:45,588 --> 00:25:46,748
And you, Spike,

292
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:49,791
though you hate to admit it, are ex-SAS.

293
00:25:49,926 --> 00:25:52,451
Remember, we're businessmen
and bankers now.

294
00:25:52,595 --> 00:25:54,620
What we do here is illegal.

295
00:25:54,764 --> 00:25:57,756
We can leave no trace of our activities.

296
00:25:57,901 --> 00:26:00,392
That's why we're called The Feather Men.

297
00:26:00,537 --> 00:26:04,473
Because our touch is light.

298
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:07,908
Our Spike is a good man.

299
00:26:08,044 --> 00:26:10,672
The day the SAS lost him,
they lost a good.

300
00:26:10,813 --> 00:26:13,577
Yes, but the problem is,
he thinks he's still in the SAS.

301
00:26:13,716 --> 00:26:15,513
Well, someone has to do the dirty work.

302
00:26:15,652 --> 00:26:17,517
None of us want blood on our pinstripes.

303
00:26:17,654 --> 00:26:20,782
Listen, I've got no problem with blood.

304
00:26:20,924 --> 00:26:23,449
What worries me is ink.

305
00:26:23,726 --> 00:26:26,194
Make sure he keeps us out of
the newspapers.

306
00:26:26,329 --> 00:26:26,920
What's doing boss?

307
00:26:27,063 --> 00:26:28,724
Your Arabic's still good, right?

308
00:26:28,865 --> 00:26:29,422
Good enough.

309
00:26:29,566 --> 00:26:32,763
You're going to Oman. I've got a bloke
I want you to tail out there.

310
00:26:35,338 --> 00:26:37,238
You lucky bastard.

311
00:26:48,518 --> 00:26:50,509
You know what, you're gorgeous.

312
00:26:51,988 --> 00:26:53,148
Where you staying?

313
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:54,586
I'm staying at the Hilton.

314
00:26:54,724 --> 00:26:57,955
As a matter of fact, so am I.
What room are you in?

315
00:26:58,094 --> 00:26:59,356
Why, would you like to know?

316
00:26:59,495 --> 00:27:00,359
Love to know.

317
00:27:00,964 --> 00:27:02,659
You are smooth.

318
00:27:16,879 --> 00:27:18,813
What are we doing out here then,
in the middle of nowhere?

319
00:27:18,915 --> 00:27:20,405
Well, I ask him to go hide it,
he hides it.

320
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,517
Could have been your asshole.

321
00:27:21,651 --> 00:27:23,118
Consider yourself lucky.

322
00:27:23,252 --> 00:27:24,480
Shut it, Meier.

323
00:27:25,021 --> 00:27:27,012
Appreciate it, thank you.

324
00:27:33,262 --> 00:27:35,787
These tiles are an exact match to
the shower step?

325
00:27:36,366 --> 00:27:37,663
Hundred percent.

326
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,768
Harris comes home, parks the car.

327
00:27:39,902 --> 00:27:41,301
It's been a hard day.
I'll have a shower.

328
00:27:41,437 --> 00:27:44,702
Whoops. He slips on the shampoo.
Hits the corner of the step

329
00:27:44,841 --> 00:27:46,138
with his occiput.

330
00:27:46,275 --> 00:27:47,902
- Case closed.
- Get out of it.

331
00:27:48,745 --> 00:27:51,111
You boys are going about this all wrong.

332
00:27:51,247 --> 00:27:53,442
That bird he's screwing is married.

333
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:55,983
Why don't we just pop Pop'em both and
make it look like her husband did it?

334
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:59,418
Pop'em both. What's she ever done?

335
00:27:59,555 --> 00:28:01,614
It's Harris we're after.

336
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:03,550
Poor bastard.

337
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,129
Ten years after the war he cops it for
doing something he was ordered to do.

338
00:28:07,263 --> 00:28:08,958
He knew what he was doing
when he joined the club.

339
00:28:09,098 --> 00:28:09,996
Yeah. What club?

340
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:11,623
The killing club.

341
00:28:12,602 --> 00:28:13,296
Could've been you or me.

342
00:28:13,436 --> 00:28:16,564
Yeah, but it's not.
I'm just glad I never killed a Rag head.

343
00:28:17,106 --> 00:28:18,471
No offence, my son.

344
00:28:18,608 --> 00:28:19,836
Let's get this done.

345
00:28:19,976 --> 00:28:23,173
Excuse my friend, he's a royal asshole.

346
00:28:32,655 --> 00:28:33,781
Shit!

347
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,821
Where's he going to run?
It's the middle of the fucking desert.

348
00:28:56,345 --> 00:28:56,743
Meier!

349
00:28:56,879 --> 00:28:58,608
Cut him off at the next shaft!

350
00:28:59,215 --> 00:29:00,182
Let's go! Let's go!

351
00:29:06,489 --> 00:29:07,683
Where is he?

352
00:29:11,227 --> 00:29:12,251
Ssh.

353
00:29:47,196 --> 00:29:47,958
Aagh!

354
00:29:48,097 --> 00:29:49,257
Ugh!

355
00:29:49,398 --> 00:29:51,593
Get out of here! Fucking hell!

356
00:29:57,807 --> 00:29:59,399
So what, now somebody's on our ass?

357
00:29:59,542 --> 00:30:00,702
We should move right away.

358
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:02,834
I'll set up Harris's interview
for tomorrow.

359
00:30:02,979 --> 00:30:05,072
Davies, you make sure his girl
doesn't show.

360
00:30:05,181 --> 00:30:06,842
She has nothing to do with this.

361
00:30:24,567 --> 00:30:26,194
Wanker!

362
00:30:36,078 --> 00:30:39,047
We're military historians.
I'll do the talking, all right.

363
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:42,640
Well, it's five o'clock somewhere,
isn't it?

364
00:30:42,785 --> 00:30:45,185
So where's this documentary going to
be shown then?

365
00:30:45,321 --> 00:30:46,652
On the telly?

366
00:30:51,961 --> 00:30:53,519
The chair.

367
00:30:54,463 --> 00:30:57,057
Those bastards in C Company
put this together hmm?

368
00:31:24,493 --> 00:31:27,121
What's the matter?
They didn't like sand in their burgers.

369
00:31:27,263 --> 00:31:27,957
Eh?

370
00:31:28,097 --> 00:31:30,122
Hello, boys! I'm not saying a word 'til
I see my lawyer.

371
00:31:31,868 --> 00:31:34,701
Think back. The village of Qum.

372
00:31:34,837 --> 00:31:39,706
You killed a guerrilla commander.
His name was Hussein bin Amr.

373
00:31:39,842 --> 00:31:41,332
Do you admit it?

374
00:31:46,415 --> 00:31:49,350
Fuck off! You're kidding, right?

375
00:31:49,485 --> 00:31:51,544
You commanded a company there.

376
00:31:54,757 --> 00:31:56,349
Aye, I led a company on that op, sure.

377
00:31:56,492 --> 00:31:59,017
Yeah, you assassinated Hussein bin Amr.

378
00:31:59,161 --> 00:32:00,924
There were witnesses.

379
00:32:01,697 --> 00:32:04,257
You dropped him in front of his family.

380
00:32:08,337 --> 00:32:11,795
All right, you got me. I did it!

381
00:32:11,941 --> 00:32:13,670
Fuck you! Good one!

382
00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:15,606
Now untie me!

383
00:32:15,745 --> 00:32:16,370
Get up.

384
00:32:18,681 --> 00:32:19,909
Hey! Piss off!

385
00:32:20,783 --> 00:32:22,341
We have what we need.

386
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:27,219
What if I told you somebody else
dropped your guerrilla commander?

387
00:32:28,224 --> 00:32:29,885
His name is?

388
00:32:30,026 --> 00:32:32,051
I can't remember.

389
00:32:32,495 --> 00:32:35,157
But he's writing a book about
the whole Oman gig.

390
00:32:35,298 --> 00:32:37,027
You might find it in there.

391
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:39,792
If you could read.

392
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,597
To the bathroom.

393
00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:44,305
No, no, no. No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait!

394
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,601
It's coming back to me,
looking at your fucking face!

395
00:32:46,742 --> 00:32:48,903
His name's Captain R. Sole!

396
00:32:49,045 --> 00:32:51,843
A, R, S, E, H, O, L, E!

397
00:32:51,981 --> 00:32:53,141
Shut up.

398
00:32:53,282 --> 00:32:54,476
You're fucking dead yeah?

399
00:32:54,951 --> 00:32:56,282
On your knees!

400
00:32:57,653 --> 00:32:59,086
Fucking queers! Serve you fucking right!

401
00:33:01,691 --> 00:33:03,522
Head down. Get your fucking hands off me
you queer!

402
00:33:04,293 --> 00:33:05,817
- You're fucking kidding me!
- Hold him still.

403
00:33:05,962 --> 00:33:06,758
If I find you I'm going to

404
00:33:06,896 --> 00:33:08,420
- put your fucking head in the toilet.
- Okay.

405
00:33:08,564 --> 00:33:10,225
Poor fucker.

406
00:33:20,876 --> 00:33:22,036
Jay!

407
00:33:22,178 --> 00:33:26,638
I need money for the taxi.
I had to take a taxi. I had a flat.

408
00:33:42,298 --> 00:33:43,765
Fuck you! Aagh!

409
00:33:53,342 --> 00:33:54,934
Case closed.

410
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,187
Thank you.

411
00:34:11,127 --> 00:34:13,925
...tells of a dramatic 12 hour
rescue operation

412
00:34:14,063 --> 00:34:16,293
to save the crew of Radio Caroline.

413
00:34:16,432 --> 00:34:17,899
The pirate radio ship sank the...

414
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,337
Seems your friend did what you couldn't.

415
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:27,842
Wouldn't.

416
00:34:28,144 --> 00:34:31,136
Wouldn't. Couldn't.
He's avenged Hussein.

417
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,475
Good news for the old man. Not for you.

418
00:34:33,616 --> 00:34:34,605
What do you mean?

419
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:37,685
Three brothers dead.
Rotting in the sand.

420
00:34:38,587 --> 00:34:41,147
You didn't want to get revenge yourself?

421
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,884
Scared of getting your hands dirty?

422
00:34:44,226 --> 00:34:46,160
Better get used to it.

423
00:34:46,295 --> 00:34:47,660
No palace where you're going.

424
00:34:47,797 --> 00:34:49,924
A tent and a hole to shit in.

425
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,963
He's your worst nightmare
because he's gonna do it.

426
00:34:55,404 --> 00:34:58,100
And when he does, you're outta here.

427
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,673
And when I find you in that desert,

428
00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:03,006
I pray God keeps my aim...

429
00:35:06,248 --> 00:35:07,840
true.

430
00:35:22,298 --> 00:35:23,287
Well, what do you think?

431
00:35:23,432 --> 00:35:25,127
Yeah, it's coming along.

432
00:35:29,872 --> 00:35:32,170
What are you doing for
New Year's Eve dinner?

433
00:35:32,975 --> 00:35:34,533
Oh shit!

434
00:35:40,783 --> 00:35:42,148
Bollocks!

435
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,510
Strangers are a bit of
an exotic thing around here.

436
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,780
Oh, come on.
I didn't think I was a stranger.

437
00:35:49,925 --> 00:35:52,120
Well, but you're still exotic.

438
00:35:52,261 --> 00:35:55,697
Danny, something tells me
you've got a story to tell.

439
00:35:56,365 --> 00:35:57,923
- Yeah.
- Mm.

440
00:36:09,345 --> 00:36:12,576
Come on, what are you waiting for?
Party's outside.

441
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:21,113
Happy New Year!

442
00:36:22,658 --> 00:36:24,592
It's a tradition around here.

443
00:36:25,227 --> 00:36:26,626
Happy New Year.

444
00:36:52,988 --> 00:36:54,250
Shit!

445
00:37:10,506 --> 00:37:14,033
Mirbat. The artist's name is
on the back.

446
00:37:14,176 --> 00:37:15,871
Have them talk to him.

447
00:37:16,946 --> 00:37:21,178
One more thing.
My boys had some trouble in Oman.

448
00:37:21,317 --> 00:37:22,784
Somebody was tailing them.

449
00:37:22,918 --> 00:37:25,352
We'll have to have a look into that,
won't we?

450
00:37:26,388 --> 00:37:27,912
Yeah.

451
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,795
Ah, that's how you get it
so life-like then.

452
00:37:39,935 --> 00:37:40,765
Sorry?

453
00:37:40,903 --> 00:37:43,804
Photos of the lads.
Isn't that like cheating?

454
00:37:43,939 --> 00:37:46,931
I'm recreating a historical event.
Accuracy's everything.

455
00:37:47,076 --> 00:37:50,842
Mm, that Mirbat painting stopped me cold
when I saw it.

456
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:51,947
You were at Mirbat?

457
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:55,949
Had a mate there. I was hoping you
might have an address for him.

458
00:37:56,085 --> 00:37:57,052
You with the SAS?

459
00:37:57,186 --> 00:37:58,312
Was.

460
00:37:59,288 --> 00:38:01,813
Your best bet for an address would be
Regimental Association...

461
00:38:01,957 --> 00:38:04,357
They won't talk to me.
I spent the last few years

462
00:38:04,493 --> 00:38:07,690
plying my trade overseas.
Angola and that.

463
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,991
I come to you unofficial like.

464
00:38:10,399 --> 00:38:11,423
Ah.

465
00:38:13,035 --> 00:38:16,766
Well, I might have something somewhere.

466
00:38:17,473 --> 00:38:18,371
Just give me a few minutes.

467
00:38:18,507 --> 00:38:20,532
Be my guest.

468
00:38:34,556 --> 00:38:36,854
I've got a bullshitter
asking about Mirbat.

469
00:38:36,992 --> 00:38:38,926
Yeah, claims he's with the Regiment.

470
00:38:39,061 --> 00:38:42,929
No, there's no way he was SAS.
Yeah, I can smell it off him.

471
00:38:43,065 --> 00:38:45,533
Nah, he's a bloody fake!

472
00:38:48,637 --> 00:38:51,936
Argh! Argh! Argh!

473
00:39:09,291 --> 00:39:12,021
My contact says the call was cut off,
but Gowling said that

474
00:39:12,161 --> 00:39:15,824
there was somebody there asking
about Mirbat. It has to be our guy.

475
00:39:15,964 --> 00:39:17,932
And what would you have us do about it?

476
00:39:18,067 --> 00:39:20,695
Find him. If we don't,
there's going to be another murder

477
00:39:20,836 --> 00:39:22,269
and it'll be one of our Mirbat boys.

478
00:39:22,404 --> 00:39:23,769
Then who are they?

479
00:39:23,906 --> 00:39:25,635
Well, they're pros for sure.

480
00:39:25,774 --> 00:39:27,207
If these guys are going after the SAS,

481
00:39:27,343 --> 00:39:29,607
they're going to be
top class professional assassins.

482
00:39:29,745 --> 00:39:31,838
They must have a string of hits
behind them,

483
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,312
but they're completely under the radar.

484
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,940
All we've got is Oman.

485
00:39:36,085 --> 00:39:36,676
Oman?

486
00:39:36,819 --> 00:39:38,582
We all know our people went too far.

487
00:39:38,721 --> 00:39:41,383
Oman. Mirbat.
It all needs to be left alone.

488
00:39:41,523 --> 00:39:44,151
You should try telling
that to the Welshman.

489
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,325
He's right.

490
00:39:46,628 --> 00:39:49,825
We have to find this phoney Welshman
and his crew.

491
00:39:51,834 --> 00:39:55,565
The file says an SAS officer killed
the Sheikh's son at Battle of Mirbat.

492
00:39:56,472 --> 00:39:59,066
Warwick Steven Cregg. He was
the only officer there that night.

493
00:39:59,208 --> 00:40:01,073
Killed everything that moved.

494
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:03,235
He's our worst nightmare.
A real hotshot.

495
00:40:03,379 --> 00:40:04,505
Paintings of him. The lot.

496
00:40:04,646 --> 00:40:05,874
Where'd you get this?

497
00:40:06,014 --> 00:40:08,346
The bloke who did the paintings.

498
00:40:09,485 --> 00:40:12,454
Don't you worry about that all right?
He's shuffled off this mortal coil.

499
00:40:12,588 --> 00:40:13,612
That wasn't part of the deal.

500
00:40:13,756 --> 00:40:16,691
Come on. Shit happens when you play
in the deep end of the pool, Danny.

501
00:40:16,825 --> 00:40:19,157
Why can't you two stick to the plan,
huh?

502
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:24,092
Well you've been watching this Cregg.
What's your next big idea?

503
00:40:24,233 --> 00:40:25,723
His wife's in hospital.

504
00:40:25,868 --> 00:40:29,031
When he's not training for the selection
march he spends most days there.

505
00:40:29,171 --> 00:40:30,695
So why don't we hit him there?

506
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:31,328
No.

507
00:40:31,473 --> 00:40:32,872
Not near his family.

508
00:40:33,008 --> 00:40:34,669
Get me everything
you know on that march.

509
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,744
We'll see where that goes.

510
00:40:48,857 --> 00:40:53,089
Okay, so there's only four Mirbat
survivors in Britain.

511
00:40:53,228 --> 00:40:55,196
I've got Locals on the other three.

512
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,854
You get the celebrity.

513
00:40:57,399 --> 00:41:00,027
Warwick Cregg? You're kidding.

514
00:41:00,169 --> 00:41:01,727
Wish I was.

515
00:41:04,406 --> 00:41:07,273
Welcome to hell
the SAS selection march.

516
00:41:07,409 --> 00:41:10,105
Forty-one miles,
fifty-five pounds of gear.

517
00:41:10,245 --> 00:41:12,679
They lose someone every couple of years.

518
00:41:14,483 --> 00:41:16,246
Don't you even think about it.

519
00:41:16,785 --> 00:41:17,444
Why not?

520
00:41:17,586 --> 00:41:20,180
During the march this place is
crawling with SAS.

521
00:41:20,322 --> 00:41:23,621
Yeah, you said it yourself
it's an accident waiting to happen.

522
00:41:23,992 --> 00:41:25,459
How are you going to catch him then?

523
00:41:25,594 --> 00:41:27,960
He's been training for months.
He's like a greyhound.

524
00:41:28,397 --> 00:41:30,558
Just have to slow him down, won't we?

525
00:41:32,434 --> 00:41:37,963
Insulin, Chlorpropamide. Initial here.

526
00:41:46,982 --> 00:41:47,641
Anything doing?

527
00:41:47,783 --> 00:41:50,616
Nah. Cregg's still in there with
his missus.

528
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,520
Here boss, this'll keep you going.

529
00:41:54,656 --> 00:41:56,248
Cheers.

530
00:42:20,349 --> 00:42:21,373
Pennock!

531
00:42:21,617 --> 00:42:23,585
I need you back here, mate. Pronto!

532
00:42:42,804 --> 00:42:44,169
Oh! What are you doing?

533
00:42:45,474 --> 00:42:47,032
What are you doing? You're fucking mad.

534
00:43:27,549 --> 00:43:29,312
Fuck! Get out of the fucking way!

535
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:36,821
He's a maniac!

536
00:43:42,764 --> 00:43:44,823
- Watch out!
- Oh! Unbelievable.

537
00:44:15,097 --> 00:44:16,086
Argh!

538
00:44:19,434 --> 00:44:20,366
Aagh!

539
00:44:23,171 --> 00:44:25,366
Ugh!

540
00:44:27,342 --> 00:44:28,741
Aaagh!

541
00:44:35,217 --> 00:44:36,184
Ugh!

542
00:44:46,995 --> 00:44:49,657
Ugh!

543
00:46:43,111 --> 00:46:45,739
You wouldn't fucking believe it.
Somebody was watching Cregg.

544
00:46:45,881 --> 00:46:46,313
What?

545
00:46:46,448 --> 00:46:47,415
Mmm.

546
00:46:47,549 --> 00:46:49,676
You think he's from the same stable
as the shooter in the desert?

547
00:46:49,818 --> 00:46:53,254
Maybe. He was good.
But whoever he is, he's too late.

548
00:46:53,722 --> 00:46:57,556
Ah good, good. Chroma slows him down,

549
00:46:57,692 --> 00:47:02,129
insulin sends him into shock.

550
00:47:02,831 --> 00:47:04,025
Hypothermia to you.

551
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:05,497
And when were you planning on
getting it to him?

552
00:47:05,634 --> 00:47:07,101
Before the march.

553
00:47:07,435 --> 00:47:10,199
How? It's an SAS base, Danny.

554
00:47:10,338 --> 00:47:12,329
That you trained in.

555
00:47:12,474 --> 00:47:15,875
So think back, the security layout,
the lot.

556
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,474
You're nuts.

557
00:47:19,614 --> 00:47:20,979
Are you going to do it?

558
00:47:21,783 --> 00:47:24,775
Man, you really are
onecrazy sonofabitch, Danny.

559
00:47:40,869 --> 00:47:43,269
Clock's ticking.
You've got under a minute, all right?

560
00:47:56,685 --> 00:47:58,152
We got company.

561
00:48:06,094 --> 00:48:06,753
Lovely night.

562
00:48:06,895 --> 00:48:08,192
You can't stop here, mate.

563
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:09,422
I didn't stop. The truck did!

564
00:48:09,564 --> 00:48:10,895
If you don't fucking move it, we will!

565
00:48:11,032 --> 00:48:12,556
All right, all right.
But it's pissing oil, mate.

566
00:48:12,701 --> 00:48:13,599
There's nothing I could do about it.

567
00:48:13,735 --> 00:48:15,532
Turn off the bloody radio.

568
00:48:32,654 --> 00:48:33,814
Where's your gear?

569
00:49:16,531 --> 00:49:19,295
Right! On the trucks!

570
00:49:19,434 --> 00:49:21,800
I don't care what regiment you're from.

571
00:49:21,937 --> 00:49:23,962
I don't care
how great you think you are.

572
00:49:24,105 --> 00:49:25,834
Let's see what you're made of, ladies.

573
00:49:25,974 --> 00:49:27,032
On the trucks.

574
00:49:27,175 --> 00:49:28,403
Come on.

575
00:49:29,277 --> 00:49:30,539
Get moving you lot.

576
00:49:56,371 --> 00:49:58,703
He only got half the dose!

577
00:49:59,507 --> 00:50:00,599
Is it enough?

578
00:50:00,742 --> 00:50:03,836
Enough? He's a dead man walking!
Stay on him, okay?

579
00:50:23,932 --> 00:50:25,991
His name was Salim Bin Amr.

580
00:50:26,134 --> 00:50:27,567
Do you remember the name?
Did you kill him?

581
00:50:27,702 --> 00:50:28,669
Think back. Did you kill him, Major?

582
00:50:28,803 --> 00:50:30,236
Yeah, I did it. I did the bastard.

583
00:50:30,372 --> 00:50:34,638
So bloody what?

584
00:50:35,844 --> 00:50:38,176
Danny didn't want to do this.

585
00:50:40,715 --> 00:50:43,479
And your boy doesn't want to go back
to the desert.

586
00:50:57,165 --> 00:51:00,134
The Ministry of Defence today
announced the death of an army officer

587
00:51:00,268 --> 00:51:04,295
during manoeuvres. The 33 year old,
Major Warwick Steven Cregg,

588
00:51:04,439 --> 00:51:08,569
died of exposure during an SAS exercise
on the Brecon Beacons.

589
00:51:09,244 --> 00:51:12,509
Weather conditions at the time were
described as appalling...

590
00:51:29,564 --> 00:51:32,226
Show a bit of respect lads.

591
00:51:43,578 --> 00:51:44,636
Top that.

592
00:51:44,779 --> 00:51:47,145
I come bearing gifts.

593
00:51:49,818 --> 00:51:51,445
Oi!

594
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,551
From my boys in Angola.

595
00:51:56,724 --> 00:51:59,192
I have no idea
how you're meant to eat this.

596
00:51:59,327 --> 00:52:00,794
So.

597
00:52:00,929 --> 00:52:02,419
So.

598
00:52:02,564 --> 00:52:03,496
Who's on our arse?

599
00:52:03,631 --> 00:52:05,394
I'm on it. Don't worry.

600
00:52:05,533 --> 00:52:07,330
Look, there's only one more to go.

601
00:52:07,469 --> 00:52:10,495
After this is done I'll get
you boys a nice cushy job in the sun.

602
00:52:10,638 --> 00:52:12,799
Hm?

603
00:52:12,941 --> 00:52:14,932
There is no "after this."

604
00:52:18,513 --> 00:52:21,676
I'm a vulture. I live off killers.

605
00:52:21,816 --> 00:52:23,977
Gives me a unique perspective.

606
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:26,280
Have you heard of the "two percent"?
That's you,

607
00:52:26,421 --> 00:52:28,480
Davies, the SAS. All you lot.

608
00:52:28,623 --> 00:52:30,488
Mercenaries, hit-men, heroes.

609
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:34,288
You're all part of that two percent
of men who are natural killers.

610
00:52:34,429 --> 00:52:36,727
That's why you'll never get out.

611
00:52:36,865 --> 00:52:39,493
You can't run away from
who you are, Danny.

612
00:52:41,436 --> 00:52:45,031
That's not who I am.
That's what I've done.

613
00:52:45,573 --> 00:52:47,336
And I can do something else.

614
00:52:47,475 --> 00:52:48,339
Yeah, yeah.

615
00:52:49,077 --> 00:52:49,941
That's all nice and good,

616
00:52:50,078 --> 00:52:52,774
but let's just take care of
business first, shall we.

617
00:52:53,948 --> 00:52:57,349
Your third target, Major Simon.

618
00:52:57,485 --> 00:52:59,180
Mad Simon of late.

619
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,548
How'd you find him?

620
00:53:00,688 --> 00:53:03,179
Asked around. It was easy.

621
00:53:03,324 --> 00:53:07,021
These days he's your basic cash for
trash mercenary.

622
00:53:08,096 --> 00:53:09,586
He's a sitting duck.

623
00:53:10,965 --> 00:53:13,456
Now didn't I tell you
I came bearing gifts.

624
00:53:14,335 --> 00:53:16,166
You know where to find me.

625
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,473
You don't trust that snake, do you?
He's lying.

626
00:53:21,609 --> 00:53:23,076
Yeah? How do you know?

627
00:53:23,211 --> 00:53:24,644
His lips were moving.

628
00:53:24,779 --> 00:53:26,542
He just gave us a third target.

629
00:53:26,681 --> 00:53:28,376
You've done nothing on that last file.

630
00:53:28,516 --> 00:53:29,710
Someone's onto us!

631
00:53:29,851 --> 00:53:32,547
I want Hunter out of there.
I want this finished!

632
00:53:32,687 --> 00:53:34,678
And I want to be around to enjoy
the money when it is.

633
00:53:34,822 --> 00:53:37,985
Well the first thing you should buy is
a pair of balls.

634
00:53:38,226 --> 00:53:40,490
We're going after. All right?

635
00:53:47,202 --> 00:53:48,726
I miss you.

636
00:53:49,404 --> 00:53:52,498
There's a lot I don't know about you,
but I do know that much.

637
00:53:53,775 --> 00:53:55,174
I convince myself that everything's okay

638
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:58,108
because when I'm with you, I'm happy.

639
00:53:59,714 --> 00:54:03,150
But then you go away and I realize
that I know nothing about you.

640
00:54:03,785 --> 00:54:05,275
I don't know where you go and
I don't know what you do.

641
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:06,944
I mean,

642
00:54:07,088 --> 00:54:09,318
you've got a whole other life Danny.

643
00:54:11,826 --> 00:54:12,690
Is there someone else?

644
00:54:12,827 --> 00:54:13,794
Come on Anne.

645
00:54:13,928 --> 00:54:15,657
Well then what is it?

646
00:54:16,497 --> 00:54:17,725
I mean, Jesus,
what are you not telling me?

647
00:54:17,865 --> 00:54:19,298
What are you hiding?

648
00:54:19,434 --> 00:54:21,527
Can we talk about this when I get back?

649
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:23,967
To hell with it.

650
00:54:27,976 --> 00:54:29,102
Fuck!

651
00:54:40,688 --> 00:54:41,677
What?

652
00:54:42,257 --> 00:54:44,191
You show me a beautiful woman

653
00:54:44,325 --> 00:54:46,623
and I'll show you a bloke
that's sick of her shit.

654
00:54:46,761 --> 00:54:47,887
Shut up.

655
00:54:48,029 --> 00:54:49,428
Roger that.

656
00:54:52,767 --> 00:54:54,564
- That him?
- That's him.

657
00:54:54,702 --> 00:54:56,431
Major Simon.

658
00:54:56,571 --> 00:55:00,371
Served in the Sultan's forces 'til
he was pensioned out four years ago.

659
00:55:01,175 --> 00:55:02,506
And another!

660
00:55:03,611 --> 00:55:04,270
Oi!

661
00:55:04,412 --> 00:55:05,606
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

662
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:07,145
Piss off, Grandpa.

663
00:55:07,282 --> 00:55:08,214
You want some?

664
00:55:09,651 --> 00:55:10,675
Oh!

665
00:55:11,552 --> 00:55:13,486
Doesn't look like an invalid.

666
00:55:14,589 --> 00:55:17,149
Like I said, a bomb went off
under his jeep.

667
00:55:17,292 --> 00:55:18,884
Scrambled his wiring.

668
00:55:19,027 --> 00:55:22,588
He can't keep a job.
He's a fucking psycho.

669
00:55:25,233 --> 00:55:26,461
Jesus.

670
00:55:28,803 --> 00:55:30,771
Come on, mate. That's enough.

671
00:55:31,973 --> 00:55:33,770
What's he doing here?

672
00:55:35,376 --> 00:55:37,970
That's the one I went head to head
with at the hospital.

673
00:55:42,984 --> 00:55:43,473
Right.

674
00:55:44,018 --> 00:55:45,383
Wait, wait, wait.

675
00:55:51,993 --> 00:55:53,085
Let's go.

676
00:55:54,329 --> 00:55:55,318
Stick with him.

677
00:56:33,968 --> 00:56:36,061
Mac, it's me. You okay?

678
00:56:36,204 --> 00:56:39,696
Oh, yeah. Still scraping skinheads off
my doorstep.

679
00:56:39,841 --> 00:56:43,072
All right, mate. I was just checking in.

680
00:56:50,585 --> 00:56:54,043
Bloke who drives that green Jag.
What's his name?

681
00:56:55,423 --> 00:56:59,689
His name's Spike Logan.
He's an ex- of some kind.

682
00:56:59,827 --> 00:57:03,160
He got his eye shot out
playing a hero somewhere.

683
00:57:03,297 --> 00:57:06,789
He's got no job and he keeps odd hours.

684
00:57:07,101 --> 00:57:08,295
Hmmm.

685
00:57:09,137 --> 00:57:11,037
Don't you know who these guys are?

686
00:57:11,172 --> 00:57:13,231
I mean, secrets being your bread
and butter.

687
00:57:13,374 --> 00:57:14,568
Don't worry about it.

688
00:57:14,709 --> 00:57:17,405
I do worry about it. You should, too.

689
00:57:17,545 --> 00:57:20,378
Every move my guys make,
these lot are waiting.

690
00:57:20,515 --> 00:57:21,743
If you ask me,

691
00:57:21,883 --> 00:57:25,580
I think it's time you put those fancy
shoes of yours on a few throats.

692
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,518
Yes. But no one is asking you.

693
00:57:33,928 --> 00:57:37,193
You'll be interviewing for
a security position, Mr. McCann.

694
00:57:37,331 --> 00:57:37,729
Right.

695
00:57:37,865 --> 00:57:40,629
Actually we got your name through
a mutual friend in the SAS.

696
00:57:40,768 --> 00:57:41,996
Yeah, really?

697
00:57:42,136 --> 00:57:44,297
So we'll see you Tuesday
the 17th at ten?

698
00:57:44,439 --> 00:57:45,201
Okay.

699
00:57:45,339 --> 00:57:46,431
We look forward to it.

700
00:57:46,574 --> 00:57:47,302
See you then.

701
00:57:47,442 --> 00:57:49,239
All right, my son.

702
00:57:50,278 --> 00:57:51,370
He'll be there.

703
00:57:51,512 --> 00:57:52,103
Good.

704
00:57:52,246 --> 00:57:53,406
I don't get it.

705
00:57:56,284 --> 00:57:57,649
McCann lives here.

706
00:57:57,785 --> 00:58:01,016
He'll be here for the interview,
Tuesday at ten.

707
00:58:02,056 --> 00:58:03,785
He'll take this road.

708
00:58:03,925 --> 00:58:06,223
The Boston Brakes! Perfect!

709
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,759
They weren't perfect in Boston.

710
00:58:07,895 --> 00:58:09,089
I wasn't at the controls!

711
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:10,254
Got ten days.

712
00:58:10,398 --> 00:58:11,422
Ten days?

713
00:58:11,566 --> 00:58:12,897
Quicker we get this done, the better.

714
00:58:13,034 --> 00:58:15,127
I'm going to need to bring in some help.

715
00:58:15,269 --> 00:58:15,735
Okay.

716
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:19,135
- Okay? Just like that?
- McCann's being watched.

717
00:58:19,273 --> 00:58:20,865
How you going to
get a confession out of him?

718
00:58:21,008 --> 00:58:24,034
We aren't. We'll fake it.

719
00:58:24,178 --> 00:58:27,477
Bit of bad lighting and camera work.
You can be him.

720
00:58:27,615 --> 00:58:30,812
What we'll do is play
what he admitted to in the reports.

721
00:58:48,169 --> 00:58:48,635
Who are you?

722
00:58:48,769 --> 00:58:50,964
I'm the one they let fly around
in an unmarked chopper

723
00:58:51,105 --> 00:58:52,367
with a gun in my pocket.

724
00:58:52,507 --> 00:58:54,065
You can call me Mfwic.

725
00:58:54,208 --> 00:58:55,140
Mfwic?

726
00:58:55,276 --> 00:58:58,074
Mother Fucker What's In Charge.

727
00:58:58,446 --> 00:59:00,107
We have questions.

728
00:59:00,481 --> 00:59:04,508
About this little illegal club of yours.
The Feather Men.

729
00:59:04,652 --> 00:59:08,110
Your attack dog,
time to bring him to heel, eh?

730
00:59:12,193 --> 00:59:13,626
And then we'll put that on the agenda.

731
00:59:13,761 --> 00:59:14,955
Gentlemen.

732
00:59:15,096 --> 00:59:16,927
We'll be with you in a minute.

733
00:59:23,471 --> 00:59:26,167
I want to put Locals on
Major McCann. Around the clock.

734
00:59:26,807 --> 00:59:29,298
I realise McCann is
an old friend of yours.

735
00:59:29,443 --> 00:59:31,138
But what has he to do with us?

736
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:36,882
But this is our chance to get the
bastards who killed Cregg and Harris!

737
00:59:37,018 --> 00:59:39,885
The authorities found no evidence of
foul play in either case.

738
00:59:40,021 --> 00:59:43,252
What are you talking about, no evidence?
I've got the evidence right here!

739
00:59:47,094 --> 00:59:50,325
Everybody in this room knows that
those men were killed.

740
00:59:51,732 --> 00:59:54,326
Everybody knows that
McCann is going to be next!

741
00:59:54,468 --> 00:59:55,298
That's enough. Spike.

742
00:59:55,436 --> 00:59:56,596
We have to do something!

743
00:59:56,737 --> 00:59:57,931
Well, we could put it to the vote.

744
00:59:58,072 --> 01:00:00,233
Yes, but that would require
the full committee,

745
01:00:00,374 --> 01:00:03,537
and... it'll have to wait.

746
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:19,725
Spike!

747
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:23,956
That was a set up! He sent him away!
He knew there'd be a vote!

748
01:00:24,098 --> 01:00:25,156
Spike, please!

749
01:00:25,299 --> 01:00:26,266
Look, listen.

750
01:00:27,335 --> 01:00:28,563
This is getting big.

751
01:00:29,437 --> 01:00:32,167
The powers that be are asking questions.
Pressure is being applied.

752
01:00:32,306 --> 01:00:33,830
They have their reputations to protect.

753
01:00:33,975 --> 01:00:36,375
I'm not doing this to
protect reputations.

754
01:00:37,378 --> 01:00:38,709
You know, a 'light touch' is one thing.

755
01:00:38,846 --> 01:00:41,314
But no touch at all? I can't do this.

756
01:00:41,449 --> 01:00:44,577
You realise this thing is set up
for maximum deniability.

757
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:45,811
You're the only one who knows

758
01:00:45,953 --> 01:00:47,887
the Locals.
All their orders come through you.

759
01:00:48,022 --> 01:00:49,853
- So?
- So?

760
01:00:49,991 --> 01:00:53,586
This comes out, you're the one
who takes the fall.

761
01:00:53,728 --> 01:00:56,128
Fall? From where?

762
01:00:57,098 --> 01:00:59,794
I am done with this whole
committee thing.

763
01:01:00,568 --> 01:01:02,058
I'm going to find him.

764
01:01:04,772 --> 01:01:07,866
He's a good kid, don't worry.
I'm schtupping his mum.

765
01:01:08,142 --> 01:01:09,575
Does he know he can't bring his mum
on the job?

766
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:11,575
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

767
01:01:29,864 --> 01:01:32,492
Tell your mates in Oman I said hello.

768
01:01:32,633 --> 01:01:36,000
Danny, is this what it was like
when you were first starting?

769
01:01:36,137 --> 01:01:39,129
This is your first job? Jesus.

770
01:01:40,341 --> 01:01:43,367
My first time I puked for
a day afterwards.

771
01:01:43,511 --> 01:01:46,241
I was young and dumb.
Just the way the army likes 'em.

772
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:48,348
I can be good at this man.

773
01:01:48,482 --> 01:01:50,416
I mean, it's easy, yeah?

774
01:01:50,551 --> 01:01:52,382
Killing's easy.

775
01:01:54,355 --> 01:01:56,949
Living with it's the hard part.

776
01:02:00,327 --> 01:02:02,818
If I see him, I'll give you a bell.

777
01:02:02,963 --> 01:02:05,693
Don't be shy about spreading the

778
01:02:06,367 --> 01:02:08,232
word. There's a very tidy finder's fee.

779
01:02:08,369 --> 01:02:10,030
I'll keep my eyes peeled.

780
01:02:10,171 --> 01:02:12,401
One more and we'll call it a night.

781
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:18,043
We're on.

782
01:02:20,214 --> 01:02:21,772
He's late.

783
01:02:24,752 --> 01:02:27,653
Just keep me at 75 feet
and give me a clear line of sight.

784
01:02:27,788 --> 01:02:29,255
Yeah, okay.

785
01:03:16,504 --> 01:03:18,495
Where'd you buy your licence!

786
01:03:21,909 --> 01:03:24,571
On his tail. Doing sixty.

787
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:32,883
You'll have a visual on Danny
in one minute.

788
01:03:37,558 --> 01:03:38,820
Stay with him, Jake.

789
01:03:38,959 --> 01:03:40,654
I got him, I got him.

790
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:43,995
We have target in sight.

791
01:03:44,131 --> 01:03:44,927
I'm going to miss it.

792
01:03:45,065 --> 01:03:47,898
Come on, get in! Get in behind him!
Just do it, get in!

793
01:03:48,035 --> 01:03:49,002
There's not enough room!

794
01:03:49,136 --> 01:03:49,693
Push him!

795
01:03:49,837 --> 01:03:50,963
I can't get in there!

796
01:03:51,105 --> 01:03:53,505
Okay then, overtake him! Go! Pass him!

797
01:03:55,242 --> 01:03:56,573
What the hell you doing Meier?

798
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:57,904
I need a range countdown.

799
01:03:58,045 --> 01:03:59,273
Meier, don't screw this up.

800
01:03:59,413 --> 01:04:00,880
I'll operate looking backwards.

801
01:04:01,015 --> 01:04:02,004
Relax, Meier.

802
01:04:02,149 --> 01:04:04,049
Davies will give you the countdown.

803
01:04:08,189 --> 01:04:09,486
Four hundred meters.

804
01:04:13,961 --> 01:04:15,326
Okay, range me.

805
01:04:19,366 --> 01:04:20,697
Three hundred meters.

806
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:24,167
Lane Meier.

807
01:04:27,308 --> 01:04:28,775
Two hundred meters.

808
01:04:32,913 --> 01:04:34,005
Here he comes.

809
01:04:35,816 --> 01:04:36,942
One hundred meters.

810
01:04:46,861 --> 01:04:47,725
Now! Now, now, now!!

811
01:04:47,862 --> 01:04:49,227
Shut up!

812
01:04:50,698 --> 01:04:52,188
Fishtail! Fishtail!

813
01:04:53,367 --> 01:04:54,231
Argh!

814
01:05:01,442 --> 01:05:02,773
Oh! Oh!!

815
01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:05,470
You fucking got him.
You got him man!

816
01:05:05,613 --> 01:05:08,081
Oh fuck, he's dead. He's dead as Elvis.

817
01:05:17,291 --> 01:05:18,451
You got him, man!

818
01:05:18,926 --> 01:05:20,291
Stop the car!

819
01:05:20,995 --> 01:05:23,156
We gotta be sure Elvis has left
the building!

820
01:05:32,206 --> 01:05:36,006
Target had a minder!
Head to the exit point!

821
01:05:39,313 --> 01:05:40,780
Bring him to me!

822
01:05:42,783 --> 01:05:43,579
He had a fucking minder!

823
01:05:43,717 --> 01:05:44,376
Fuck, you got him, man!

824
01:05:44,518 --> 01:05:46,145
- You got him!
- Just shut up! Drive!

825
01:05:46,287 --> 01:05:47,413
Go, go, go!

826
01:05:47,721 --> 01:05:48,119
Who is he?

827
01:05:48,255 --> 01:05:50,314
I don't know. Give me an update, Davies.

828
01:05:52,259 --> 01:05:53,988
Oh, man, he's coming fast!

829
01:05:56,163 --> 01:05:57,653
Up here there's a yard.
Take a left. Shit.

830
01:05:57,798 --> 01:05:59,163
Up here to the left. Keep going!

831
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:00,767
Hold on.

832
01:06:02,303 --> 01:06:03,861
Come in, Davies!

833
01:06:09,143 --> 01:06:10,838
Davies, where the fuck are you?

834
01:06:11,111 --> 01:06:13,238
Got you, you bastards!

835
01:06:14,581 --> 01:06:17,448
Fuck this! Go, go!

836
01:06:20,321 --> 01:06:21,754
Here he comes. Here he comes!

837
01:06:26,226 --> 01:06:27,716
Get out of the car!

838
01:06:28,562 --> 01:06:30,462
Where the fuck do you guys come from?

839
01:06:30,597 --> 01:06:32,531
- Step away from the car.
- Easy.

840
01:06:32,666 --> 01:06:33,997
Take it easy.

841
01:06:34,134 --> 01:06:36,625
Check the car! Slowly!

842
01:06:37,604 --> 01:06:38,764
No no no!

843
01:06:49,083 --> 01:06:50,345
Argh!! No!!

844
01:07:09,536 --> 01:07:11,265
No ID. Nothing. Not a fucking thing.

845
01:07:12,806 --> 01:07:13,830
Who the fuck is he?

846
01:07:14,975 --> 01:07:16,237
It shouldn't have happened.

847
01:07:18,846 --> 01:07:21,906
It should not have fucking happened!

848
01:07:22,049 --> 01:07:22,777
Take it easy Danny.

849
01:07:22,916 --> 01:07:23,382
Danny.

850
01:07:23,517 --> 01:07:24,984
Take it easy?

851
01:07:26,153 --> 01:07:28,644
We were out of there, clean! Done!

852
01:07:50,277 --> 01:07:51,073
Look, I'm getting nothing.
Campbell's not picking.

853
01:07:51,211 --> 01:07:53,179
- Is there anything at your end?
- Fuck!

854
01:07:53,313 --> 01:07:53,870
No, still no sign.

855
01:07:54,014 --> 01:07:56,209
- Who are these bastards?
- We've got a burnt Volvo here.

856
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:58,181
I don't know
but they're looking for their man.

857
01:07:58,318 --> 01:08:02,049
And they're not legit.
Jake, call this number.

858
01:08:03,424 --> 01:08:06,086
Tell the Agent we need a clean up
crew here ASAP.

859
01:08:06,226 --> 01:08:08,592
And wire that radio into my car.

860
01:08:08,729 --> 01:08:10,458
Gimme here!

861
01:08:14,201 --> 01:08:14,792
So that's it then.

862
01:08:14,935 --> 01:08:16,095
Yeah. Done.

863
01:08:18,806 --> 01:08:21,866
I'll fly out tonight.
You should get going, too.

864
01:08:22,009 --> 01:08:23,101
They're close.

865
01:08:23,243 --> 01:08:24,733
What happens to Meier's cut?

866
01:08:25,379 --> 01:08:27,040
There has to be somebody.

867
01:08:27,181 --> 01:08:30,548
Poor sod. I'll have a hooker for him.
He'd like that.

868
01:08:31,718 --> 01:08:32,912
Yeah.

869
01:08:33,353 --> 01:08:34,786
Be safe.

870
01:08:35,055 --> 01:08:36,886
You too, Davies.

871
01:08:44,331 --> 01:08:48,062
I'm sorry. I'm still looking for,
but it looks bad.

872
01:09:18,532 --> 01:09:21,433
Thank you sir. If there's anything else

873
01:09:21,568 --> 01:09:25,004
Room service. Something exotic.

874
01:09:47,127 --> 01:09:47,525
Yeah?

875
01:09:47,661 --> 01:09:49,356
I found your Welshman.

876
01:09:50,564 --> 01:09:51,690
You sure it's him?

877
01:09:51,832 --> 01:09:53,299
I'm sure.

878
01:10:25,098 --> 01:10:26,395
- Hell!
- Fucking

879
01:10:28,235 --> 01:10:29,634
Get up. Get dressed.

880
01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:32,637
Move! Move! Get up!

881
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:35,699
Don't say a word to anyone.
Do you understand?

882
01:10:37,077 --> 01:10:39,375
You killed Simon, didn't you?

883
01:10:39,813 --> 01:10:42,839
Yeah, and Campbell! Where is he,
you fucker?

884
01:10:42,983 --> 01:10:44,314
Never heard of him!

885
01:10:47,788 --> 01:10:49,016
That all you got?

886
01:10:52,693 --> 01:10:53,625
Yeah Spike.

887
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,091
We got the Welshman.

888
01:10:55,229 --> 01:10:57,026
We're bringing him to you now. Over.

889
01:10:57,831 --> 01:11:00,391
Nice work Pennock. Well done.

890
01:11:00,534 --> 01:11:03,002
I'm looking forward to meeting
the bastard.

891
01:11:03,670 --> 01:11:04,500
Urrgh!

892
01:11:07,341 --> 01:11:10,071
Hey, Spike's going to cut your dick off
and shove it in your mouth.

893
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:10,767
You like that?

894
01:11:10,911 --> 01:11:11,468
I like the sound of that, yeah.

895
01:11:11,612 --> 01:11:12,738
- Do you? Yeah.
- Yeah I do.

896
01:11:12,879 --> 01:11:14,141
Get in the van. Get in.

897
01:11:14,281 --> 01:11:16,181
Come on. Get in.

898
01:11:24,258 --> 01:11:26,852
Fuck me, you're kidding.
Come on, get in!

899
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:35,530
There you are, you prick!

900
01:11:45,646 --> 01:11:46,203
Oi!

901
01:11:49,983 --> 01:11:51,348
Get out of the road you fucking idiot!

902
01:11:51,485 --> 01:11:51,883
- Open up!
- Piss off!

903
01:11:52,019 --> 01:11:53,316
Oi! Oi wait!

904
01:12:07,601 --> 01:12:08,863
Boss?

905
01:12:15,142 --> 01:12:16,837
What am I meant to do with that?

906
01:12:17,577 --> 01:12:18,601
He had this on him.

907
01:12:19,012 --> 01:12:21,276
Oh, a phone number. Great work.

908
01:12:23,050 --> 01:12:25,041
That pile of mince meat was
our best chance of finding out

909
01:12:25,185 --> 01:12:26,812
who these bastards are!

910
01:12:27,587 --> 01:12:31,216
Print him. And trace that bloody number.

911
01:12:33,226 --> 01:12:35,319
You fucking idiots!

912
01:12:51,778 --> 01:12:52,972
Drop it.

913
01:12:53,847 --> 01:12:56,975
Left hand. The gun. On the floor.

914
01:13:05,659 --> 01:13:07,058
Kick it to me.

915
01:13:10,464 --> 01:13:12,125
The Welshman.
They were bringing him to you.

916
01:13:12,265 --> 01:13:13,527
Where is he?

917
01:13:13,667 --> 01:13:15,362
He didn't make it.

918
01:13:16,069 --> 01:13:17,798
You. You do it?

919
01:13:17,938 --> 01:13:20,702
A truck. He made a break for it.

920
01:13:20,841 --> 01:13:21,967
He got lucky.

921
01:13:22,442 --> 01:13:23,841
It would've been very slow otherwise.

922
01:13:23,977 --> 01:13:25,604
Yeah, well that was my fucking friend!

923
01:13:25,746 --> 01:13:27,441
Yeah? And McCann was mine.
And what about fucking

924
01:13:27,581 --> 01:13:28,809
Cregg

925
01:13:29,649 --> 01:13:31,014
No.

926
01:13:31,151 --> 01:13:34,678
Davies. Meier. Harris.

927
01:13:34,821 --> 01:13:40,521
McCann. Cregg. Campbell.
Too many names on that list.

928
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:43,026
Don't go adding yours. Spike.

929
01:13:43,163 --> 01:13:44,892
Inside.

930
01:13:47,901 --> 01:13:48,833
Who are you?

931
01:13:49,536 --> 01:13:50,867
Doesn't matter.

932
01:13:51,638 --> 01:13:53,401
After tonight I don't exist.

933
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:55,064
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

934
01:13:55,208 --> 01:13:57,039
It's over. Done.

935
01:13:57,177 --> 01:13:58,508
You think so?

936
01:14:00,947 --> 01:14:03,780
No uniform. No war. Not special.

937
01:14:04,718 --> 01:14:06,549
You don't know what to do with yourself.

938
01:14:07,421 --> 01:14:09,616
Nobody knows what to do with you. Right?

939
01:14:09,756 --> 01:14:10,688
Wrong.

940
01:14:10,824 --> 01:14:13,224
You know my name, but you don't know me.

941
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,590
You have no idea
who you're fucking with.

942
01:14:15,729 --> 01:14:16,991
Really?

943
01:14:19,232 --> 01:14:20,859
Don't follow me.

944
01:14:21,902 --> 01:14:24,302
Don't put your name on that list.

945
01:14:34,848 --> 01:14:37,043
The third confession.

946
01:14:43,223 --> 01:14:45,521
The killers have been killed.

947
01:14:45,659 --> 01:14:48,594
Now you can go home.

948
01:14:49,663 --> 01:14:51,756
You can have your man.

949
01:14:52,666 --> 01:14:54,861
You will get the money
when it's been checked.

950
01:14:55,635 --> 01:14:57,125
Bring him out.

951
01:14:59,239 --> 01:15:00,831
Bring him out!

952
01:15:03,677 --> 01:15:06,202
Let me put...
I just want to put my watch on.

953
01:15:06,346 --> 01:15:07,745
What's the matter with you?

954
01:15:07,881 --> 01:15:09,109
- You right?
- Yeah.

955
01:15:09,249 --> 01:15:10,546
What's the plan?

956
01:15:10,684 --> 01:15:12,151
We get out of here.

957
01:15:12,285 --> 01:15:14,515
Okay. Sounds good.

958
01:15:18,825 --> 01:15:20,986
I was sure you were going to
get yourself killed, Kiddo.

959
01:15:21,127 --> 01:15:23,527
How the hell did you do it?
How'd you pull it off?

960
01:15:23,663 --> 01:15:24,721
I don't want to talk about it.

961
01:15:24,865 --> 01:15:26,332
I get it. But thank you.

962
01:15:26,466 --> 01:15:27,592
Not for me but for my kids.

963
01:15:27,734 --> 01:15:29,395
For them having a dad.

964
01:15:29,536 --> 01:15:31,163
I can never thank you enough for
what you did. Never.

965
01:15:31,304 --> 01:15:33,772
Yeah you can.
You can get out of the business.

966
01:15:33,907 --> 01:15:34,999
Be done with this shit.

967
01:15:35,141 --> 01:15:37,268
No more ing. No more mercenary work.
All right.

968
01:15:37,410 --> 01:15:39,105
Okay, okay.

969
01:15:40,213 --> 01:15:43,512
I'm asking you, please.
Tell me you're done.

970
01:15:44,684 --> 01:15:45,878
I'm done. I'm out.

971
01:15:46,019 --> 01:15:48,351
Good. Well stay out.

972
01:15:48,488 --> 01:15:50,115
Otherwise all this is for nothing.

973
01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:52,385
So how are the Yankees doing?

974
01:16:18,919 --> 01:16:20,614
You could've called.

975
01:16:21,955 --> 01:16:23,354
You wouldn't have answered.

976
01:16:24,357 --> 01:16:26,848
No. Sorry about that.

977
01:16:27,661 --> 01:16:30,926
You're sorry?
It's me who should be sorry.

978
01:16:34,968 --> 01:16:38,335
So it's over? You going back again?

979
01:16:39,139 --> 01:16:40,504
No.

980
01:16:43,410 --> 01:16:46,004
And you're ready to tell me everything?

981
01:16:47,247 --> 01:16:48,942
Whatever you want to know.

982
01:16:52,252 --> 01:16:53,412
Good.

983
01:16:55,555 --> 01:16:59,457
Except I don't want to know.
Not anymore.

984
01:17:04,397 --> 01:17:06,365
I've... I've missed you, Danny.

985
01:17:08,068 --> 01:17:11,265
I don't really care about the past.
I just care about now.

986
01:17:31,758 --> 01:17:32,486
Hey boss.

987
01:17:32,626 --> 01:17:33,354
All right Cal?

988
01:17:33,493 --> 01:17:34,460
That phone number.

989
01:17:34,594 --> 01:17:35,856
That was a business.

990
01:17:35,996 --> 01:17:37,896
It's for some shit travel agent.

991
01:17:38,031 --> 01:17:41,728
Runs mercenaries in and out of
every shit-hole in the world.

992
01:17:42,469 --> 01:17:43,561
Come in.

993
01:18:04,624 --> 01:18:05,852
Hello?

994
01:18:06,459 --> 01:18:08,222
Hello, Danny.

995
01:18:10,797 --> 01:18:12,355
Where'd you get this number?

996
01:18:12,499 --> 01:18:16,435
Please Danny
don't insult my professionalism.

997
01:18:17,804 --> 01:18:18,793
What do you want?

998
01:18:18,938 --> 01:18:21,133
We got a problem with the job.

999
01:18:24,444 --> 01:18:25,240
The job's done.

1000
01:18:25,378 --> 01:18:27,573
No. You killed the wrong guy.

1001
01:18:27,714 --> 01:18:28,772
There's one more to go.

1002
01:18:28,915 --> 01:18:30,576
I busted my nuts setting this job up

1003
01:18:30,717 --> 01:18:31,706
and I want my ten percent.

1004
01:18:31,851 --> 01:18:34,945
No. I did what I had to do.

1005
01:18:35,088 --> 01:18:38,956
Tell that to the Sheikh.
He wants a London meet with his son.

1006
01:18:39,192 --> 01:18:42,889
Check with your girlfriend before
you make any rash decisions, eh?

1007
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:55,633
What are you doing? Come to bed.

1008
01:20:02,242 --> 01:20:03,209
Come with me, Anne.

1009
01:20:03,810 --> 01:20:04,572
What?

1010
01:20:04,711 --> 01:20:06,042
To Paris.

1011
01:20:06,579 --> 01:20:08,604
You can wait for me there
while I'm in London.

1012
01:20:08,748 --> 01:20:10,648
Leave tomorrow.
Nothing's keeping you here, right?

1013
01:20:10,784 --> 01:20:13,514
I... it's the middle of the night.
You can't do this...

1014
01:20:13,653 --> 01:20:16,053
Anne. Anne! They know about you.

1015
01:20:16,189 --> 01:20:18,123
Who knows about me?

1016
01:20:19,692 --> 01:20:21,660
And about us.

1017
01:20:55,662 --> 01:20:56,959
When will this be over?

1018
01:20:57,096 --> 01:20:58,529
Soon.

1019
01:21:01,134 --> 01:21:02,795
If all goes well.

1020
01:21:03,603 --> 01:21:05,070
It will, won't it?

1021
01:21:33,566 --> 01:21:34,498
Danny.

1022
01:21:35,034 --> 01:21:36,331
Keep a good eye on her, huh?

1023
01:21:36,469 --> 01:21:38,494
Listen, don't do this on your own.

1024
01:21:38,638 --> 01:21:39,605
No other way.

1025
01:21:39,739 --> 01:21:41,263
Davies? Meier? All this heat on you?

1026
01:21:41,407 --> 01:21:43,341
C'mon. Let's just get in the car
and go to London.

1027
01:21:43,476 --> 01:21:44,704
Hit the airport and that's it

1028
01:21:44,844 --> 01:21:46,505
No. We have a deal remember?

1029
01:21:46,646 --> 01:21:48,910
What, do you think I can't cut this?
Is that it?

1030
01:21:49,048 --> 01:21:50,447
I mean I'm not a babysitter. Come on.

1031
01:21:50,583 --> 01:21:53,211
I need to know she's safe.
You're the only one I trust.

1032
01:21:53,353 --> 01:21:56,015
This is bullshit. You could run.
Both of you. Just go. Come on.

1033
01:21:56,155 --> 01:21:58,419
Everyone gets found. You know that.

1034
01:21:58,925 --> 01:22:00,893
You're gonna get yourself killed kiddo.

1035
01:22:07,166 --> 01:22:08,599
Thanks for doing this.

1036
01:22:09,569 --> 01:22:11,036
You got to be kidding me.

1037
01:22:23,549 --> 01:22:25,779
- Welcome back to London, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

1038
01:23:05,425 --> 01:23:06,585
You tell the old man
he threatens her again,

1039
01:23:06,726 --> 01:23:08,216
I'll put it between his eyes.

1040
01:23:08,361 --> 01:23:10,295
Harris. The pilot.

1041
01:23:10,430 --> 01:23:13,058
On his film
he said another killed my brother.

1042
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:16,362
He was winding us up.
He thought it was some kind of a joke.

1043
01:23:16,502 --> 01:23:18,470
This was just published.

1044
01:23:19,672 --> 01:23:21,902
The author served with the SAS.

1045
01:23:22,842 --> 01:23:25,367
He describes an ambush where
he killed a guerrilla leader.

1046
01:23:26,946 --> 01:23:29,141
Harris did not kill Hussein.

1047
01:23:33,019 --> 01:23:36,978
You gave me his name.
You said he was guilty.

1048
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:40,251
Well, such is Allah's will.

1049
01:23:41,361 --> 01:23:42,988
Allah's will!

1050
01:23:43,129 --> 01:23:45,529
You had me kill an innocent man.

1051
01:23:46,032 --> 01:23:49,763
The book will be
the real killer's confession.

1052
01:23:50,770 --> 01:23:52,397
Now my father needs

1053
01:23:52,805 --> 01:23:55,296
I know what your father needs!

1054
01:24:07,387 --> 01:24:09,787
I need everything
you can get on a Ranulph Fiennes.

1055
01:24:09,922 --> 01:24:12,447
Yeah, writer. Ex-SAS.

1056
01:24:22,969 --> 01:24:25,130
LGM Travel. How can I help you?

1057
01:24:27,073 --> 01:24:27,903
What you got?

1058
01:24:28,541 --> 01:24:30,065
I got Fiennes.

1059
01:24:30,309 --> 01:24:32,675
He's still pushing his book on Oman.

1060
01:24:32,779 --> 01:24:35,873
He'll be doing a press bash on Tuesday.

1061
01:24:37,517 --> 01:24:38,245
Tuesday?

1062
01:24:38,384 --> 01:24:41,046
I know it's a bit short notice but
I'll be able to pull a crew together.

1063
01:24:41,187 --> 01:24:44,350
No. I'll do this on my own.

1064
01:24:44,857 --> 01:24:47,951
Danny, are you sure?
It's just a phone call.

1065
01:24:49,362 --> 01:24:51,353
I guess he's sure.

1066
01:24:55,635 --> 01:24:58,968
B - I - N - G fucking O.

1067
01:24:59,906 --> 01:25:02,739
I knew I'd find you, you bastard.

1068
01:25:19,759 --> 01:25:21,249
Do you mind if I sit down?

1069
01:25:22,462 --> 01:25:23,087
You looked lonely.

1070
01:25:23,229 --> 01:25:24,628
You're Danny's friend.

1071
01:25:26,065 --> 01:25:27,555
The famous Hunter.

1072
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:28,997
He say nice things?

1073
01:25:29,135 --> 01:25:30,602
What are you doing here?

1074
01:25:31,471 --> 01:25:32,802
Watching you.

1075
01:25:32,939 --> 01:25:34,065
You should be with him.

1076
01:25:34,207 --> 01:25:36,675
I tried. Didn't work.

1077
01:25:36,809 --> 01:25:38,538
He wanted me here to protect you.

1078
01:25:38,678 --> 01:25:40,305
And you looked like
you needed protecting.

1079
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:41,974
From what?

1080
01:25:42,281 --> 01:25:43,908
You.

1081
01:25:45,218 --> 01:25:48,847
You're thinking about him
not coming back. What happens then.

1082
01:25:49,922 --> 01:25:50,320
No. I...

1083
01:25:50,456 --> 01:25:52,822
I have a wife. I know the look.

1084
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:56,727
We've known each other through thick
and thin,

1085
01:25:57,730 --> 01:26:01,393
Danny and I. Celine, my wife,
she loves him. My kids love him.

1086
01:26:01,534 --> 01:26:03,661
I mean, wild animals like Danny. Yeah.

1087
01:26:06,706 --> 01:26:09,174
I know Danny's going to
come back for you.

1088
01:26:10,309 --> 01:26:12,834
And when he does
you're gonna steal him away, huh?

1089
01:26:13,913 --> 01:26:15,608
I don't know what the plan is.

1090
01:26:17,950 --> 01:26:19,042
Monsieur?

1091
01:26:20,086 --> 01:26:20,848
Oui Monsieur?

1092
01:26:21,521 --> 01:26:23,751
- Bottle de vin rouge s'il vous plait?
- Tout de suite.

1093
01:26:23,890 --> 01:26:26,415
I have a woman to interrogate now.

1094
01:26:32,231 --> 01:26:33,721
All right, look alive lads.

1095
01:26:33,866 --> 01:26:34,855
Boys.

1096
01:26:35,935 --> 01:26:37,732
So this guy is good, very good.

1097
01:26:37,870 --> 01:26:39,599
He senses something's up, he runs,

1098
01:26:39,739 --> 01:26:41,297
you corner him, he fights.

1099
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,271
But now the gloves are off.

1100
01:26:43,409 --> 01:26:44,876
This all fucking ends today.

1101
01:26:45,011 --> 01:26:46,569
All right, everybody knows the rules.

1102
01:26:46,712 --> 01:26:48,270
There are no rules.

1103
01:27:21,814 --> 01:27:24,009
Boss, he's out front. I think we're on.

1104
01:27:32,558 --> 01:27:34,389
This could be him. Black leathers.

1105
01:27:34,727 --> 01:27:35,785
Roger that.

1106
01:27:50,276 --> 01:27:51,971
He just took the service stairs.
It has to be him.

1107
01:27:52,144 --> 01:27:54,977
Just hold your positions.
We'll know soon enough.

1108
01:28:24,243 --> 01:28:25,039
He's down, boss! We got him!

1109
01:28:25,177 --> 01:28:27,941
He stays alive Pennock!
Don't you touch him 'til I'm there!

1110
01:28:28,914 --> 01:28:29,744
You stay here!

1111
01:28:35,855 --> 01:28:37,254
Stay there you fucker!

1112
01:28:39,191 --> 01:28:40,954
Get his helmet off before he chokes.

1113
01:28:47,333 --> 01:28:48,527
Shit!

1114
01:28:51,304 --> 01:28:53,363
Hands high. Against the wall.

1115
01:28:56,475 --> 01:28:58,170
Okay. Easy with that.

1116
01:28:58,911 --> 01:29:00,936
Agh! Ugh!

1117
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:40,111
Guys, our man's down. Head for the roof.

1118
01:30:07,913 --> 01:30:09,574
Pennock! Head for the roof.

1119
01:30:10,383 --> 01:30:12,977
We're on our way up now, boss.
Come on, move!

1120
01:30:38,677 --> 01:30:40,770
He jumped! He jumped!

1121
01:31:12,278 --> 01:31:14,303
Come on, come on! He's on the move.
Let's go!

1122
01:31:55,154 --> 01:31:57,019
Shh.

1123
01:31:59,925 --> 01:32:00,857
Pennock?

1124
01:32:03,028 --> 01:32:04,393
Don't you do it.

1125
01:32:07,266 --> 01:32:09,131
There's no sign of him up here, boss.

1126
01:32:09,268 --> 01:32:12,203
I can see all the way to the river.
He's gone.

1127
01:32:24,483 --> 01:32:25,381
Shit.

1128
01:32:26,919 --> 01:32:28,682
Move and you're dead!

1129
01:32:31,390 --> 01:32:33,085
All right. Let's go, let's go.

1130
01:32:37,029 --> 01:32:38,155
Get in!

1131
01:32:58,918 --> 01:33:00,283
What is this?

1132
01:33:03,355 --> 01:33:04,720
That's for Campbell.

1133
01:33:07,059 --> 01:33:09,425
- And that's for Cregg.
- You finished?

1134
01:33:10,629 --> 01:33:12,062
We haven't even started!

1135
01:33:12,197 --> 01:33:13,528
Take the hood off.

1136
01:33:15,668 --> 01:33:17,397
Wait, boys.

1137
01:33:22,141 --> 01:33:23,938
Save a little bit for us, boss.

1138
01:33:27,413 --> 01:33:30,075
So why is he still alive?
Why didn't you kill him?

1139
01:33:31,450 --> 01:33:32,917
That what'd you'd have done?

1140
01:33:33,752 --> 01:33:35,447
I thought you were the good guys.

1141
01:33:35,588 --> 01:33:39,217
Who are you? Who do you work for?

1142
01:33:39,892 --> 01:33:41,450
You and I have got a lot in common.

1143
01:33:41,594 --> 01:33:44,154
Really? You think so?

1144
01:33:44,296 --> 01:33:46,856
So you're sitting there tied to a chair,

1145
01:33:46,999 --> 01:33:49,467
and I'm standing here with
a gun in my hand.

1146
01:33:49,602 --> 01:33:53,197
Now you tell me
what the fuck this was all about!

1147
01:33:54,506 --> 01:33:55,871
Was?

1148
01:33:57,409 --> 01:33:59,036
You think this is over?

1149
01:33:59,178 --> 01:34:00,975
There'll be somebody else.

1150
01:34:01,113 --> 01:34:03,047
Your boy, Fiennes, is going to die.

1151
01:34:03,182 --> 01:34:04,581
Ugh!

1152
01:34:04,717 --> 01:34:05,741
Argh!!

1153
01:34:12,925 --> 01:34:16,053
Go on! Pull the trigger!
Kill me and you kill Fiennes!

1154
01:34:16,195 --> 01:34:17,355
They won't stop 'til they get him!

1155
01:34:17,496 --> 01:34:19,088
I stopped you, I'll stop them!

1156
01:34:19,231 --> 01:34:23,099
I didn't want to kill him. They will.

1157
01:34:24,303 --> 01:34:26,794
You put that in the right hands and
this thing's over.

1158
01:34:26,939 --> 01:34:28,133
The camera? Why?

1159
01:34:28,273 --> 01:34:31,868
Proof. Evidence that he's dead.

1160
01:34:33,412 --> 01:34:35,403
It's the only way you'll save him.

1161
01:34:36,482 --> 01:34:37,915
You tell me I walk,
I tell you who's behind this.

1162
01:34:38,050 --> 01:34:39,984
And where to find him.

1163
01:34:42,221 --> 01:34:45,850
Okay. You walk.

1164
01:34:47,526 --> 01:34:49,756
Sheikh Amr bin Issa.

1165
01:34:50,095 --> 01:34:51,619
You'll find him in Oman.

1166
01:34:51,764 --> 01:34:52,662
Why?

1167
01:34:52,798 --> 01:34:53,856
The war.

1168
01:34:55,934 --> 01:34:57,697
They killed three of his sons.

1169
01:35:05,244 --> 01:35:06,142
Nuh.

1170
01:35:14,353 --> 01:35:16,150
Some good guy, eh?

1171
01:35:23,762 --> 01:35:24,922
Drop it.

1172
01:35:32,304 --> 01:35:33,396
Inside.

1173
01:35:40,345 --> 01:35:42,677
Beside him. On your knees.

1174
01:35:54,026 --> 01:35:55,493
You were set up.

1175
01:35:55,627 --> 01:35:57,595
That's what we love about you lot.

1176
01:35:58,263 --> 01:36:00,390
You only care about the action.

1177
01:36:00,833 --> 01:36:06,032
Never think about what you might
really be fighting for. Or who.

1178
01:36:07,906 --> 01:36:10,101
Never see the big picture.

1179
01:36:14,747 --> 01:36:19,081
You're the one that was set up.
He just wouldn't get out of the way.

1180
01:36:21,019 --> 01:36:24,477
Her Majesty's Government doesn't like
secret societies.

1181
01:36:25,357 --> 01:36:27,917
Particularly when they get in the way
of our interests.

1182
01:36:29,061 --> 01:36:32,030
Do you know how much oil that pathetic
crust of desert is floating on?

1183
01:36:33,732 --> 01:36:34,721
Do you know what those contracts
are worth?

1184
01:36:34,867 --> 01:36:36,357
Three men's lives.

1185
01:36:36,502 --> 01:36:37,901
That's right.

1186
01:36:39,772 --> 01:36:41,000
That's right.

1187
01:36:41,140 --> 01:36:43,904
We deliver the killers,
son number four goes home,

1188
01:36:44,042 --> 01:36:48,604
and when Sheikhy re-ups the contracts
we get favourable consideration.

1189
01:36:49,181 --> 01:36:50,648
- A bargain.
- You bastard. You're a...

1190
01:36:50,783 --> 01:36:52,011
A patriot.

1191
01:36:52,151 --> 01:36:55,314
Who serves his country as
those three men did with their deaths.

1192
01:36:56,054 --> 01:36:57,385
As you will with yours.

1193
01:37:55,180 --> 01:37:56,408
Oh, holy crap!

1194
01:37:58,984 --> 01:37:59,678
What?!

1195
01:38:08,694 --> 01:38:10,559
Oi! You! Come back!

1196
01:38:27,079 --> 01:38:28,671
There she is.

1197
01:38:28,814 --> 01:38:30,873
Danny might have dropped off the radar,

1198
01:38:31,016 --> 01:38:34,952
but one thing's for sure,
he'll come back for her.

1199
01:38:35,087 --> 01:38:36,315
He'll come through that door

1200
01:38:36,455 --> 01:38:39,982
with six million dollars
and she won't be there.

1201
01:38:40,125 --> 01:38:44,528
Who don't you screw out of
his ten percent? Yours truly.

1202
01:38:45,898 --> 01:38:46,990
Boss.

1203
01:38:51,403 --> 01:38:52,427
Deal with him.

1204
01:39:00,212 --> 01:39:01,543
Ugh!

1205
01:39:05,183 --> 01:39:06,343
Aagh!

1206
01:40:09,247 --> 01:40:13,081
It wasn't personal. It's just business.

1207
01:40:14,786 --> 01:40:18,984
You played us. I don't care why.

1208
01:40:19,124 --> 01:40:22,321
But if ever a lying piece of shit
needed killing, it was you.

1209
01:40:26,732 --> 01:40:27,721
Game's over.

1210
01:40:27,866 --> 01:40:29,163
You know I wouldn't have hurt her.

1211
01:40:30,102 --> 01:40:33,071
I just wanted my cut.
She was only collateral.

1212
01:40:41,313 --> 01:40:42,837
You go after them,

1213
01:40:43,749 --> 01:40:46,115
I'll find you.

1214
01:40:46,251 --> 01:40:50,187
Remember, everybody gets found.
Even you.

1215
01:41:05,270 --> 01:41:06,328
You got to get those photos to
that old bastard

1216
01:41:06,471 --> 01:41:09,099
and finish this thing for good,
you hear kiddo?

1217
01:41:09,241 --> 01:41:11,471
That's why I'm here. What about you?

1218
01:41:12,010 --> 01:41:13,568
Babysitting's over, kiddo.

1219
01:41:15,047 --> 01:41:15,536
Who says?

1220
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:18,171
I say. She's safe.
You're the one taking the chances now.

1221
01:41:18,316 --> 01:41:18,873
Come on.

1222
01:41:19,017 --> 01:41:21,076
Come on?
You walked into a trap last time,

1223
01:41:21,219 --> 01:41:23,119
you think I'm going to
let you do that again?

1224
01:41:23,255 --> 01:41:24,916
I told your girl you were going to
be coming back to her...

1225
01:41:25,057 --> 01:41:25,989
you wanna make a liar out of me?

1226
01:41:26,124 --> 01:41:28,854
Yeah, well you were supposed to
be guarding her, not interviewing her.

1227
01:41:28,994 --> 01:41:31,758
Well, I was always a sucker for
a pretty face, no denying that.

1228
01:41:31,897 --> 01:41:34,457
She's a keeper, that's for sure.

1229
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:37,363
She doesn't know, does she?

1230
01:41:37,502 --> 01:41:38,526
Some.

1231
01:41:39,204 --> 01:41:39,761
Yeah, it's going to be tough.

1232
01:41:39,905 --> 01:41:43,136
My old man used to say life's like
licking honey from a thorn.

1233
01:41:43,442 --> 01:41:44,500
Yeah, what does that mean?

1234
01:41:44,643 --> 01:41:46,702
Something about good times
and bad times.

1235
01:41:46,845 --> 01:41:49,973
Seems like it's been all thorns
for us lately. Both of us.

1236
01:41:50,115 --> 01:41:51,548
All right. Let's finish this.

1237
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:53,547
I'll be top cover.

1238
01:41:53,685 --> 01:41:55,778
If anything goes wrong, I'm coming in.

1239
01:41:55,921 --> 01:41:58,719
Hey, look, the Sheikh wants this over.
It's in, hand over the photos and out.

1240
01:41:58,857 --> 01:41:59,346
Yeah?

1241
01:41:59,491 --> 01:42:01,425
Yeah. There isn't gonna be a problem.

1242
01:42:02,194 --> 01:42:04,059
From your mouth to God's ears.

1243
01:42:04,196 --> 01:42:06,664
Don't move 'til I give the all clear,
okay.

1244
01:42:27,018 --> 01:42:29,953
Who are you? What do you want?

1245
01:42:33,158 --> 01:42:34,557
For the Sheikh.

1246
01:42:36,294 --> 01:42:38,660
I have to see it placed in his hands.

1247
01:42:50,942 --> 01:42:53,172
Take these to my people.

1248
01:42:53,311 --> 01:42:55,836
Show them what I have done.

1249
01:42:58,183 --> 01:42:59,980
I have a message for the Sheikh.

1250
01:43:06,591 --> 01:43:08,456
He's still alive.

1251
01:43:11,997 --> 01:43:13,430
They're fakes.

1252
01:43:16,902 --> 01:43:18,335
But this is going to end.

1253
01:43:33,318 --> 01:43:34,842
I don't care.

1254
01:43:35,820 --> 01:43:36,980
Huh?

1255
01:43:37,389 --> 01:43:43,225
What would I do huh?
In that god forsaken desert!

1256
01:43:48,934 --> 01:43:50,765
Have you forgotten something?

1257
01:44:08,053 --> 01:44:09,520
Hold it, hold it. Stay where you are.

1258
01:44:09,654 --> 01:44:11,178
Something's not right.

1259
01:44:19,197 --> 01:44:20,357
You see this?

1260
01:44:20,498 --> 01:44:21,726
Yeah, I see it.

1261
01:44:28,206 --> 01:44:29,833
Looks like we're in the wrong place.

1262
01:44:49,194 --> 01:44:50,218
Let's go, let's go!

1263
01:45:31,169 --> 01:45:32,796
Relax. I only killed the car.

1264
01:46:16,314 --> 01:46:17,474
You again.

1265
01:46:26,624 --> 01:46:29,855
Back at the Palace.
What happened in there?

1266
01:46:31,596 --> 01:46:33,928
He was there,
waiting for a message from you.

1267
01:46:34,065 --> 01:46:35,692
I was the messenger.

1268
01:46:35,834 --> 01:46:36,926
And?

1269
01:46:37,068 --> 01:46:38,365
What do you think?

1270
01:46:39,104 --> 01:46:42,005
His boy in there didn't give a shit.
He's not going back to the desert,

1271
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:44,335
so there'll be no oil contracts.

1272
01:46:45,443 --> 01:46:47,138
It was all for nothing.

1273
01:46:47,278 --> 01:46:48,802
Is that right?

1274
01:47:01,459 --> 01:47:03,086
And the winner is...

1275
01:47:04,195 --> 01:47:05,662
So that's what this is all about?

1276
01:47:05,797 --> 01:47:08,391
Yeah. It's all hookers
and blow from here on in.

1277
01:47:09,033 --> 01:47:11,024
You just don't get it, do you?

1278
01:47:13,538 --> 01:47:14,266
Ditch it.

1279
01:47:14,406 --> 01:47:15,839
You sure?

1280
01:47:16,241 --> 01:47:17,902
Ditch it.

1281
01:47:19,611 --> 01:47:21,511
I gotta cover my expenses.

1282
01:47:23,481 --> 01:47:24,846
You can't go back to England.

1283
01:47:24,983 --> 01:47:26,211
Not after killing that Spook.

1284
01:47:26,351 --> 01:47:27,511
Who the fuck are you?

1285
01:47:27,652 --> 01:47:30,052
Who? Me? The voice of experience.

1286
01:47:30,188 --> 01:47:30,779
Where are you going to go?

1287
01:47:30,922 --> 01:47:32,082
What are you going to do?

1288
01:47:32,223 --> 01:47:33,155
You're gonna need this.

1289
01:47:33,792 --> 01:47:36,192
New name, new face, new papers.

1290
01:47:36,327 --> 01:47:38,693
Expensive. You'll see.

1291
01:47:48,039 --> 01:47:49,506
Damn shame.

1292
01:47:53,578 --> 01:47:55,443
You think you get to just walk away?

1293
01:47:56,347 --> 01:47:57,939
Nobody walks away.

1294
01:47:58,650 --> 01:48:01,244
Not me, you, none of us.

1295
01:48:01,886 --> 01:48:03,751
The old man you just killed,

1296
01:48:04,923 --> 01:48:07,983
he told me a war isn't over 'til
both sides say it is.

1297
01:48:08,126 --> 01:48:10,720
Well, I'm telling you now,
this is over for me.

1298
01:48:10,862 --> 01:48:12,557
Really? And what?
You want me to say, Me too"?

1299
01:48:12,697 --> 01:48:14,494
And then it's happy ever after.

1300
01:48:14,632 --> 01:48:15,929
Your choice.

1301
01:48:16,067 --> 01:48:18,160
You know, when I got this,
they told me my war was over.

1302
01:48:18,303 --> 01:48:21,568
I told them they were full of shit.
Now I'm telling it to you.

1303
01:48:21,906 --> 01:48:23,498
Let it go.

1304
01:48:30,081 --> 01:48:31,412
So where are you going?

1305
01:48:31,716 --> 01:48:33,377
Why? You planning a visit?

1306
01:48:33,952 --> 01:48:35,419
You never know.

1307
01:48:37,956 --> 01:48:41,119
If you come, I'll be waiting.

1308
01:48:47,332 --> 01:48:49,357
We'll call you a cab from the airport.

1309
01:49:12,123 --> 01:49:15,991
Hey. Aren't you Anne Frazer?
The girl with those weird gumboots?

1310
01:49:18,029 --> 01:49:20,190
Are you Danny Bryce,
the boy who went away?

1311
01:49:20,331 --> 01:49:23,164
Yeah. I'm back.

1312
01:49:23,968 --> 01:49:25,196
Where you headed?

1313
01:49:26,337 --> 01:49:27,668
I don't know.

1314
01:49:27,805 --> 01:49:30,899
Me neither. Want to come along?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
