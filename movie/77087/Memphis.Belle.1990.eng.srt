1
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,685
<i>BRUCE: Okay, let's see who we got here. </i>

2
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:46,106
<i>Virge Hoogesteger. 
What kind of name is that? </i>

3
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,735
<i>Youngest of six. 
Worked in the family diner before joining. </i>

4
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:53,321
<i>Writes home every week. 
Nicknamed "The Virgin. "</i>

5
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,368
<i>Who's this goon? </i>

6
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,954
<i>Jack Bocci from Chicago. </i>

7
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,665
<i>Graduate of several reform schools. </i>

8
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:06,293
<i>Better keep him in the background. </i>

9
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,424
<i>This is the religious one. 
There's always a religious one. </i>

10
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:16,470
<i>Eugene McVey from Cleveland. 
There's always one from Cleveland. </i>

11
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:20,390
<i>Nineteen, high-strung, 
always coming down with something. </i>

12
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,809
<i>How'd he get in this bunch? </i>

13
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:29,483
<i>Richard "Rascal" Moore. 
Eighteen, 5' 4", 120 pounds. </i>

14
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,194
<i>Has a real reputation as a ladies' man. </i>

15
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,654
<i>At least, that's what he says. </i>

16
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,700
<i>Clay Busby, a farmer's son. </i>

17
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,578
<i>When his father lost their farm
in a poker game... </i>

18
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,789
<i>... Clay started playing piano
in a New Orleans cathouse. </i>

19
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,125
<i>The papers'll love that. </i>

20
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:52,339
<i>This kid couldn't be more Irish if he tried, 
Danny Daly. </i>

21
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:55,467
<i>A-student, editor of the school paper, 
valedictorian. </i>

22
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,429
<i>He volunteered the day
after he graduated from college. </i>

23
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:04,184
<i>That's not bad. I think we got something
to work with here. </i>

24
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,277
FOOTBALLER: They're coming in!

25
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,458
EUGENE: That's 15, 16!
VIRGE: There's another one!

26
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,385
COMMANDING OFFICER:
At this point, 15 or 16.

27
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:42,389
They're still coming in.
How can I promise 24 planes tomorrow?

28
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,058
I don't know if they'll all make it back.

29
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,810
Where?

30
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,147
I thought we hit that target a month ago.

31
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:56,611
I know we have to keep the pressure on,
but I lost almost a quarter of my squadron.

32
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,074
Yes, sir.

33
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,827
I'll have the ground crews work
through the night.

34
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,665
I'd hoped to give the boys a break.
We're having a dance tonight in honor...

35
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,461
Yes, sir.

36
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,881
I will update you when I know more.

37
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,509
Thank you, sir. Good-bye.

38
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,263
Sir, eighteen planes, three still out.

39
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,030
So, that's the crew of the Memphis Belle?

40
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,366
The enlisted men.
You'll meet the officers this afternoon.

41
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,287
They must be the 10 luckiest
sons of bitches in the world.

42
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,707
CO: They're just ordinary men.
BRUCE: Are you kidding?

43
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,880
Ordinary? First they volunteer for all this.

44
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:01,676
Then they fly 24 missions without
a scratch. Doesn't sound ordinary to me.

45
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,553
MAJOR: Two more, sir.

46
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,774
People back home are getting discouraged
by our losses.

47
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,860
They're thinking daylight bombing
is a mistake.

48
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,655
- It's the only way we'll win this war.
- We must get that message across.

49
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,240
That's where I come in.

50
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,826
The nation will fall in love with those boys.

51
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,705
The first crew in the Eighth Air Force
to complete their tour of duty.

52
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,957
CO: They haven't done it yet.
BRUCE: They will.

53
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,460
You'll make sure of that, right?

54
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:43,802
DANNY: One more.

55
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,553
Just one more.

56
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,890
It'd be great if everyone came back today,
with the dance and all.

57
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,892
CLAY: I give them four to one.

58
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,061
Any takers?

59
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,230
JACK: I'll have some.

60
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,857
CLAY: Show me your money.
JACK: Loan me some money.

61
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,860
EUGENE: Do I look like Wells Fargo?
JACK: You look like a weenie.

62
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,320
DANNY: There it is!

63
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,283
VIRGE: I heard there's a swell band
for the dance.

64
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,827
DANNY: Maybe they'll let you croon a tune.
CLAY: No.

65
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,788
EUGENE: You always sing in the plane.

66
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,998
CLAY: Yeah, but you guys got no taste.

67
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,959
CREWMAN: Come on, hurry up!

68
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,627
CREWMAN: Let's get out of here!

69
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:28,114
BRUCE: You named the plane
after your girl back home?

70
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:29,949
It's a great angle.

71
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,493
You don't sound
like you're from the South, Captain.

72
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,704
I met her when I was in Memphis
on business.

73
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,540
I bet she's a living doll, eh, Dennis?

74
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,667
She's a fine woman, sir.

75
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:46,424
A lifeguard?
That's a pretty responsible job, Luke.

76
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:50,511
It's rough basking in the sun all day,
having girls swarm all over you.

77
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,347
I joined up to get away from all that.

78
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,476
BRUCE: That's good!

79
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,312
Val. What is that short for?

80
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,605
Valentine!

81
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,482
I bet women love that.

82
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,028
BRUCE: Now, you're the bombardier, and...

83
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,906
... I understand you've had four years
of medical school.

84
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,076
<i>VAL: Well...
BRUCE: When your picture is in Life...</i>

85
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:17,163
<i>... every man and woman in America
will want you to be their doctor. </i>

86
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,000
Look at the camera, Phil.

87
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,878
BRUCE: Sit up straight.

88
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,548
BRUCE: Smile.

89
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,550
What is there to smile about?

90
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:33,971
One more mission and you get to go home.
That'd make me smile.

91
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,557
Well, you're not me.

92
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,976
Please just take the picture.

93
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,104
PHIL: Is that all?
BRUCE: Not quite.

94
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,941
BRUCE: You'll go back home in the Belle.

95
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:49,487
Fly all over the US, making speeches,
getting people to buy more war bonds...

96
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,532
... work longer hours, put out more planes.

97
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:56,285
And, believe me,
you'll be wined, womened, and songed...

98
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,871
... from one end of the States to the other.

99
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:02,750
It'll be tough,
but we all have to make sacrifices.

100
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,168
We'll be famous?

101
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,920
Afraid so, Luke.

102
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,632
DENNIS: Colonel Derringer?

103
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,051
I'm Army PR. Call me Bruce.

104
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,471
We'll follow your orders...

105
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,058
These are not orders.
We're working together on this.

106
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,271
DENNIS: Fine. But I don't want the others
finding out about this yet.

107
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:27,692
<i>Pictures in Life? Wine, women and song?
You got to tell them, they'll go nuts.</i>

108
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:31,362
I don't want them going nuts.
I want them thinking of their jobs.

109
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:35,074
We could do our jobs in our sleep.
Why can't they know?

110
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,618
Because I said so.

111
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,873
My father used to say that.

112
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:50,214
Dennis, you're the boss. You tell the crew
whenever you think it's right.

113
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,593
Now, can we have just one more shot?

114
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,013
What? Are you kidding me?

115
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:02,143
What are you smiling about?
You brought this unclean deck.

116
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:06,731
JACK: Okay, get your money.
Once again, Jack Bocci gets stiffed.

117
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:14,196
Clay, shouldn't you let the Sarge
go through Becker's stuff?

118
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,451
EUGENE: We don't want Sarge to send
anything embarrassing to his widow.

119
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,119
CLAY: Candy bar.
VIRGE: Me.

120
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,414
VIRGE: Which one do you like better?

121
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,083
This one's shiny aluminum. Very modern.

122
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:31,088
This one's a little more homey,
with the brick and the little bushes.

123
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,715
This one. Why?

124
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:37,386
I'm going to open a bunch of restaurants
exactly like the first one.

125
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:40,389
You'd get the exact same burger
in Detroit...

126
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,725
... as you got in Baltimore or Philadelphia.

127
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,811
Nobody wants the same food
wherever they go.

128
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,439
Sure they do. It's comforting.

129
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,654
VIRGE: It is comforting.
CLAY: Love letters.

130
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,866
EUGENE: Wife or girlfriend?
RASCAL: Read them aloud.

131
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,367
CLAY: Girlfriend.

132
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,079
Pocket knife. Photos.

133
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,914
Any clean socks?

134
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,959
CLAY: Dirty book!
DANNY: I'll take it.

135
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,340
Hey, look!

136
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,134
- Becker forgot his good luck charm.
- Poor slob.

137
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,012
Should have worn it around his neck.
He'd never forget it.

138
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,639
CLAY: Rubbers.
RASCAL: Dibs!

139
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:27,561
Virge the Virgin won't need these. Swear
you'll tell me if you lose your cherry.

140
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,271
I'll send it to you COD.

141
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:33,234
JACK: Clay, give me. Becker owed me $10.
DANNY: Don't take his money.

142
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,945
Clam up, mug-face. He owed me.

143
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,530
What do you know about Germany?

144
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,448
EUGENE: Pretty women.
DANNY: Good beer.

145
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,951
The hamburger's named after a town there.

146
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:46,872
A little bird tells me
that's where they're sending us tomorrow.

147
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:50,376
EUGENE: Are you sure?
RASCAL: We can't go. Our plane's broke.

148
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,087
VIRGE: It's fixed.
RASCAL: Let's go break it.

149
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:57,299
- They wouldn't send us there our last time.
- They'd send us on a milk run to France.

150
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,759
VIRGE: I hope so.

151
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,386
DANNY: They would.

152
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,681
CLAY: Anybody want the rest of this?
Who wants the cigarettes?

153
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,641
JACK: Let me take the razor blades.

154
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,559
Eugene!

155
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,441
I'm sending this to your wife!

156
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,362
RASCAL: We may be going
to Germany tomorrow.

157
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:04,074
My short, young life could be snuffed out
in an instant.

158
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,119
RASCAL: I volunteered
thinking it would be fun.

159
00:13:07,202 --> 00:13:08,996
RASCAL: I never thought...

160
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,873
RASCAL: Oh, Faith!

161
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,042
When I think I may never see the stars...

162
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,461
... listen to good music, or...

163
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,465
... talk to a beautiful girl like you.

164
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,258
RASCAL I'm sorry.

165
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,470
RASCAL: You need a drink.
I'll be right back.

166
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:31,060
Danny, she is crazy about me.
She's going to jump on me any second.

167
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:36,940
Had enough?

168
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,735
<i>How come they brought Life magazine?
To jinx us?</i>

169
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:43,322
Forget about it.
Let's get a couple girls and dance.

170
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,950
Tell me the truth. The truth.
Are you scared?

171
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:48,827
No.

172
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,830
I'm Val. Come on.

173
00:13:55,667 --> 00:14:00,339
It's my favorite food in the world!
You've never had a burger? Unbelievable!

174
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,384
- You don't know what you're missing.
- They sound wonderful.

175
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:06,261
It's been so long since I had any meat.

176
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:11,683
I work the meat very slowly, very tenderly.
That's the secret.

177
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:15,813
I rub in a little Worcestershire,
add garlic, a little thyme.

178
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:20,150
Then I ease it into a patty, very gently,
so I don't bruise the meat.

179
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,986
Virge, you're making me so hungry!

180
00:14:38,418 --> 00:14:41,922
We're going to have to excite people
on this bond tour. Inspire them.

181
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:46,468
Now, Dennis is a fine man,
but he doesn't have your enthusiasm.

182
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,846
I'm a qualified pilot, same as him.

183
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,514
They didn't have a plane ready...

184
00:14:50,597 --> 00:14:54,143
... so he's the big shot pilot
and I'm in the dummy seat.

185
00:14:55,602 --> 00:14:58,480
You're no dummy, Luke.
We both know that.

186
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,651
DENNIS: Being captain?

187
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:07,406
Well, you've got nine men
who are totally depending on you.

188
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,244
What did you do before the war?
I was in the furniture business.

189
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,455
This isn't like making furniture,
see what I mean?

190
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,624
Right.

191
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,797
- I'm not making sense.
- No, you are.

192
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:28,635
Thanks a lot, Captain.
I'm going to get back to my date.

193
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,187
Well, I...

194
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,523
I'll miss you, gal.

195
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:30,030
We've been together a long time.

196
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,408
You never let me down.

197
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,912
I can't say that about many people.

198
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,542
You know how to take care of your men.

199
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,797
That's about the best thing
a fellow can say about any gal.

200
00:16:50,258 --> 00:16:52,010
I can't believe it.

201
00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:55,555
It's going to be over so soon.

202
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,478
I can't imagine going home.

203
00:17:05,273 --> 00:17:06,441
Home.

204
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,366
Won't be the same, will it?

205
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,922
Good night.

206
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,276
Virge, I wish you'd talk to me like that.

207
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,697
The Captain'd murder me
if he caught us in here.

208
00:17:54,197 --> 00:17:55,949
Oh, jeez. Put that out.

209
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:59,202
Come on. Let's get this over with
and get back to the dance.

210
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,414
Wait.

211
00:18:03,456 --> 00:18:04,916
There. It was that.

212
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,586
My wrench! I was looking for it.
Where'd you find it?

213
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,754
Under my bum.

214
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:13,175
Thanks. I thought someone had stolen it.

215
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,677
Virge, forget the bloody wrench.

216
00:18:18,638 --> 00:18:19,681
I'm sorry.

217
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:21,391
Here, let me rub it.

218
00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:23,977
You've never done this, have you?

219
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,105
Why? Am I doing something wrong?

220
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:31,610
No.

221
00:18:44,831 --> 00:18:46,833
Is that your brand new plane out there?

222
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:50,629
ROOKIE: Yeah. Mother and Country.
RASCAL: Mother and Country!

223
00:18:51,254 --> 00:18:53,757
- We had our first practice today.
- How'd it go?

224
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,760
We need a couple more.
If you guys have any advice...

225
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,846
Get a gun, shoot yourself in the foot,
and go home.

226
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,181
EUGENE: That's good advice.

227
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:05,185
Are those size eight? How about
leaving a will saying when you get shot...

228
00:19:05,268 --> 00:19:09,064
... on your first mission
that those nice new pumps come to me?

229
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:27,499
You okay?

230
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:29,918
Yeah.

231
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,878
Nerves, I guess.

232
00:19:32,545 --> 00:19:34,881
We were just fooling around.

233
00:19:34,964 --> 00:19:37,384
I remember when I first got here.

234
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:38,677
Same thing.

235
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,846
I'd give anything to be in your place.

236
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,557
One more and you guys get to go home.

237
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,976
Sometimes I wish I could stay.

238
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,231
Sounds crazy, but I'm used to it here.

239
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:55,735
These guys...
These jerks are like brothers to me.

240
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,613
I never had any brothers.

241
00:19:59,155 --> 00:20:01,282
I have four older sisters.

242
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:06,204
When we get back home,
I don't know when we'll get together.

243
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,581
We come from all over.

244
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,503
I guess that's why
I keep taking their pictures.

245
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,841
You'll be like that with your crew.

246
00:20:19,175 --> 00:20:20,844
Close your eyes.

247
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,392
It's good luck.

248
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:47,871
Clay, now's your chance.
Go up there and sing!

249
00:20:47,954 --> 00:20:50,540
I'm not going to make a fool of myself.

250
00:20:50,665 --> 00:20:52,584
EUGENE: You're a great singer.

251
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,922
<i>BRUCE: Ladies and gentlemen... </i>

252
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,092
<i>... we have... </i>

253
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:04,053
<i>... 10 very special men here tonight. </i>

254
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,849
<i>I'm sure you know who I mean. </i>

255
00:21:08,391 --> 00:21:13,104
<i>They're about to become the first crew
in the Eighth Air Force... </i>

256
00:21:13,354 --> 00:21:16,149
<i>... to fly their 25th and final mission. </i>

257
00:21:16,774 --> 00:21:19,319
<i>Let's hear it for the crew
of the Memphis Belle! </i>

258
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,738
Hip hip hooray!

259
00:21:21,821 --> 00:21:24,199
DANNY: No, no. It's bad luck.

260
00:21:37,378 --> 00:21:41,299
<i>CLAY: Let's do Danny Boy in C,
and come in on the second chorus.</i>

261
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,345
Thank you, sir.

262
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:51,476
<i>CLAY: This buddy of mine
mine keeps begging me to sing, and... </i>

263
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:56,439
<i>... it looks like I ain't gonna get
out of it this time, so here it goes. </i>

264
00:22:02,862 --> 00:22:05,990
No, get back here.
You're not getting out of this.

265
00:23:13,182 --> 00:23:15,226
I don't want to die.

266
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:20,857
I don't want to die!

267
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,280
<i>I don't want to die! </i>

268
00:23:51,053 --> 00:23:53,222
SERGEANT: Captain Dearborn.

269
00:23:53,347 --> 00:23:57,393
SERGEANT: Mission today.
Breakfast,0600. Briefing,0645.

270
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,979
SERGEANT: Lieutenant Sinclair?
LUKE: I'm up.

271
00:24:02,857 --> 00:24:04,734
SERGEANT:
Where's Lieutenant Lowenthal?

272
00:24:04,817 --> 00:24:06,444
DENNIS: Val, where's Phil?

273
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,573
In the can. He couldn't sleep.

274
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:13,493
VAL: Nerves.
SERGEANT: Can't say I blame him.

275
00:24:13,576 --> 00:24:15,453
SERGEANT: Give them hell today.

276
00:24:40,895 --> 00:24:42,021
DANNY: Jack.

277
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:45,566
Oh, no. I can see it. I get back home...

278
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:49,946
... I'm doing it to the wife, the door opens,
there's Danny taking a picture.

279
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:52,365
Anyone seen my St. Anthony medal?

280
00:24:52,448 --> 00:24:56,744
- He's the patron saint of missing things.
- Yeah. I can't find him.

281
00:24:59,455 --> 00:25:02,583
VAL: Chief, I need you over here
to look at this.

282
00:25:03,459 --> 00:25:05,461
PHIL: Bogey, six o'clock low.

283
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,466
VAL: Good morning.
PHIL: Flying, Lieutenant?

284
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,136
VAL: What, are you drunk?
PHIL: Why, are you?

285
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:17,807
VAL: Are you kidding? We got a mission!
PHIL: I know. That's why.

286
00:25:18,057 --> 00:25:22,561
See, I'm going to get it today.
My number's up, my luck's run out.

287
00:25:24,563 --> 00:25:27,733
I'm gonna die, so I want
to give you something to remember me by.

288
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,235
VAL: Get ahold of yourself.

289
00:25:29,318 --> 00:25:32,363
I don't want your watch!
We're counting on you!

290
00:25:32,446 --> 00:25:35,992
Want my gold cuff links?
They got my initials on them.

291
00:25:36,492 --> 00:25:37,910
VAL: You'll let everyone down.

292
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:41,080
PHIL: Want my New York Yankee
baseball cards? I got DiMaggio.

293
00:25:41,163 --> 00:25:43,374
PHIL: What about
my Rita Hayworth pin-up?

294
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:47,086
VAL: Stick your finger down your throat.

295
00:25:47,211 --> 00:25:50,214
VAL: Stick your finger down your throat
or I'll do it for you!

296
00:25:55,803 --> 00:25:57,346
PHIL: I feel better.

297
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,609
Are you thinking of sneaking this on
the plane? I'm shocked at your behavior.

298
00:26:10,693 --> 00:26:12,945
Virge goes out for the pass!

299
00:26:15,114 --> 00:26:17,158
JACK: Hey, wise guys! Knock it off!

300
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:18,576
Found it.

301
00:26:32,965 --> 00:26:36,844
JACK: These powdered eggs
would gag a buzzard. You done with that?

302
00:26:36,927 --> 00:26:40,347
CLAY: It'll be a milk run today.
I can feel it in my bones.

303
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:44,685
- Last time they sent us to Wilhelmshaven.
- I hope they don't send us back there.

304
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,855
They wouldn't do that.
Not to my mama's baby boy.

305
00:26:49,982 --> 00:26:51,609
COOK 1: Give them hell today.

306
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,986
COOK 2: Bacon?
VAL: Yeah.

307
00:26:56,822 --> 00:26:57,990
Eggs?

308
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:01,035
Give him extra. He's real hungry.

309
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,958
Good morning, men.

310
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:10,085
Everything all right?

311
00:27:10,586 --> 00:27:13,797
Stop it! You won't have a chance
to do that after today.

312
00:27:13,881 --> 00:27:16,675
I wouldn't be so sure about that. Right?

313
00:27:23,057 --> 00:27:26,352
Well, looks like we've all got the jitters
this morning.

314
00:27:26,602 --> 00:27:28,854
I'll see you after briefing.

315
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:39,281
LUKE: How will he get through briefing?

316
00:27:39,406 --> 00:27:41,408
VAL: On a wing and a prayer.

317
00:27:44,578 --> 00:27:47,498
ROOKIE: I thought we'd have more practice
before we went up.

318
00:27:47,623 --> 00:27:49,208
You'll do fine.

319
00:27:50,751 --> 00:27:52,169
SERGEANT: Ten-hut!

320
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,549
CO: At ease.

321
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:05,849
I hope you had a good time last night.
Now it's back to business.

322
00:28:11,397 --> 00:28:14,483
The target for today is Bremen.

323
00:28:20,322 --> 00:28:23,450
CO: We have a chance to make a difference
in this war...

324
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:26,120
... so let's do the best job we can.

325
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,872
Leave the rest in the hands of God.

326
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:33,794
With luck, it'll all be over soon,
and we can go back home to our families.

327
00:28:33,877 --> 00:28:37,006
<i>Good luck. Over to you, Major Comstock. </i>

328
00:28:37,131 --> 00:28:39,925
MAJOR: Good morning.
Sergeant, get the lights.

329
00:28:40,968 --> 00:28:43,012
<i>This is our target area. </i>

330
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,765
They're long rectangular buildings.
The only rectangular ones there...

331
00:28:46,849 --> 00:28:51,770
<i>... so you can't miss them. Note the
S-shaped road to the factory for sighting. </i>

332
00:28:51,979 --> 00:28:56,400
<i>The Flugzeugbauer is a major
assembly plant for 190 fighter planes. </i>

333
00:28:56,775 --> 00:28:59,111
<i>Now, you're leading the group today... </i>

334
00:28:59,236 --> 00:29:02,031
<i>... 360 planes are bombing
on your command... </i>

335
00:29:02,114 --> 00:29:05,451
... so let's be accurate.
This is a civilian area here.

336
00:29:05,826 --> 00:29:09,663
<i>This is a hospital. These are houses. 
This is a school and a playground. </i>

337
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:12,499
<i>Note the railway tracks, north northwest. </i>

338
00:29:13,834 --> 00:29:15,085
DANNY: Hey!

339
00:29:15,586 --> 00:29:16,628
Bremen.

340
00:29:16,712 --> 00:29:19,214
Bremen? Oh, we're dead men.
We're dead.

341
00:29:19,298 --> 00:29:21,800
VIRGE: Shut up, Rascal!
RASCAL: You shut up!

342
00:29:21,967 --> 00:29:24,261
EUGENE: Clay, what are the odds today?

343
00:29:24,344 --> 00:29:26,513
CLAY: They'll overload us with bombs...

344
00:29:26,597 --> 00:29:30,059
... so it's 30 to 1 we'll crash
and blow up on takeoff.

345
00:29:30,184 --> 00:29:32,978
They'll throw every fighter they got at us...

346
00:29:33,061 --> 00:29:36,023
JACK: Skip the gory details.
CLAY: Basically, we're finished.

347
00:29:36,106 --> 00:29:37,691
VIRGE: Chief's coming.

348
00:31:55,537 --> 00:31:59,207
<i>DANNY: Tower, this is Army 485. Over.
TOWER: 485, go ahead. </i>

349
00:31:59,291 --> 00:32:02,210
This is a radio check.
Charlie, Uncle, Victor, Tango.

350
00:32:06,089 --> 00:32:08,592
As soon as you're ready, call in.

351
00:32:08,842 --> 00:32:10,260
VAL: Bombardier checking in.

352
00:32:11,053 --> 00:32:12,429
PHIL: Navigator checking in.

353
00:32:12,763 --> 00:32:14,347
VIRGE: Top turret checking in.

354
00:32:14,973 --> 00:32:17,142
DANNY: Radio operator checking in.

355
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:20,771
RASCAL: Ball turret checking in.

356
00:32:20,854 --> 00:32:23,231
Right waist gunner checking in.

357
00:32:25,067 --> 00:32:26,818
Left waist gunner checking in.

358
00:32:29,196 --> 00:32:31,156
CLAY: Tail gunner checking in.

359
00:32:32,908 --> 00:32:35,202
- Intercoolers.
- Set.

360
00:32:35,285 --> 00:32:37,162
- Generators.
- Set.

361
00:32:37,454 --> 00:32:39,706
- Fuel boost pumps.
- Set.

362
00:32:41,917 --> 00:32:42,959
Good.

363
00:32:43,085 --> 00:32:45,253
Crew, assume positions for takeoff.

364
00:32:45,337 --> 00:32:47,130
There's a jeep coming.

365
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:55,305
LIEUTENANT: We got a delay. Cloud cover
over the target. It could blow over.

366
00:32:55,388 --> 00:32:56,765
Stand by 'til further notice.

367
00:32:56,848 --> 00:32:59,768
DENNIS: For how long?
LIEUTENANT: They don't tell me doodly.

368
00:33:01,228 --> 00:33:03,146
Damn it! They always do this!

369
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:05,398
We're delayed.
Cloud cover over the target.

370
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:08,902
<i>They want us to stand down
'til further notice. Tell the others. </i>

371
00:33:09,027 --> 00:33:12,364
DANNY: Fellows, the target's clouded over.
We're delayed.

372
00:33:13,114 --> 00:33:15,242
JACK: Son of a bitch!

373
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:16,701
RASCAL: Snafu.

374
00:33:16,785 --> 00:33:19,830
JACK: Situation normal.
CREW: All fucked up!

375
00:33:21,248 --> 00:33:22,999
RASCAL: Hear that, Clay?

376
00:33:23,124 --> 00:33:26,920
Okay, let's takes this extra time
to double double check everything.

377
00:33:27,087 --> 00:33:29,631
Let's make this our best mission yet.

378
00:33:29,756 --> 00:33:31,633
DENNIS: Brakes.
LUKE: Didn't you hear?

379
00:33:31,716 --> 00:33:35,387
There's complete cloud cover over Bremen.
We're not going anywhere.

380
00:33:35,637 --> 00:33:36,888
Brakes.

381
00:33:39,391 --> 00:33:43,395
Set. They were set before
and they're still set.

382
00:33:43,603 --> 00:33:45,105
Intercoolers.

383
00:33:46,273 --> 00:33:47,107
Check!

384
00:33:48,275 --> 00:33:50,068
DENNIS: Converters.
LUKE: On.

385
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,405
DENNIS: Generators.
LUKE: Off.

386
00:33:54,656 --> 00:33:56,950
DENNIS: Fuel booster pumps.
LUKE: On.

387
00:33:57,993 --> 00:34:00,161
DENNIS: Hydraulic pressure.
LUKE: Check.

388
00:34:00,412 --> 00:34:02,122
DENNIS: Fuel transfer valves.

389
00:34:02,956 --> 00:34:03,957
LUKE: Off.

390
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,584
DENNIS: Oxygen supply.

391
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,632
Say, Pop, is it busted?

392
00:34:13,466 --> 00:34:14,968
I don't know what's wrong.

393
00:34:15,051 --> 00:34:18,638
CLAY: I got one like that at home.
Let me take a look at it.

394
00:34:20,056 --> 00:34:21,808
VIRGE: You're nervous.
RASCAL: I'm not!

395
00:34:21,891 --> 00:34:25,270
RASCAL: It jammed on me last time.
I'm the one who has to sit in it!

396
00:34:25,353 --> 00:34:27,814
VIRGE: I checked it out. It's okay.
Take it easy.

397
00:34:27,981 --> 00:34:31,109
RASCAL: Thanks, Virgin.
VIRGE: The name's Virgil.

398
00:34:31,192 --> 00:34:32,652
Not to me.

399
00:34:32,777 --> 00:34:34,863
Rascal, I could tell you something.

400
00:34:34,946 --> 00:34:37,324
What could you tell me, Virgin?

401
00:34:37,907 --> 00:34:39,117
Nothing.

402
00:34:45,874 --> 00:34:49,794
LUKE: You just call me on the intercom
and say you got trouble on the tail.

403
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:52,255
I come back, you give me the gun
for five minutes.

404
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:53,715
CLAY: It's against regulations.

405
00:34:53,798 --> 00:34:55,842
LUKE: Screw the regulations.

406
00:34:55,925 --> 00:34:59,346
CLAY: If they found out they'd put
my hot dog in a bun and chow down.

407
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:01,598
LUKE: No one will know! Just you and I.

408
00:35:01,681 --> 00:35:04,434
I want to get my hands
on that gun just once.

409
00:35:04,517 --> 00:35:07,771
How will I get girls
if I haven't killed a single Nazi?

410
00:35:07,854 --> 00:35:10,648
Please. I'll do anything you say,
just name your price.

411
00:35:13,985 --> 00:35:15,820
CLAY: Anything?
LUKE: Anything.

412
00:35:16,488 --> 00:35:18,198
CLAY: Give me your dog.

413
00:35:29,918 --> 00:35:31,586
CLAY: Seven to one we're not going.

414
00:35:31,669 --> 00:35:33,922
VAL: Let's just get it over with.

415
00:35:34,297 --> 00:35:37,425
I'd rather get it over going
to a nice little French target.

416
00:35:37,509 --> 00:35:40,637
RASCAL: If we bail we can hide out
in a French girl's hayloft.

417
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,263
VIRGE: Is that all you think about?

418
00:35:42,347 --> 00:35:45,016
Yes, it is. I have to make up for you.

419
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,977
- Grow up, Rascal.
- Shut up! You make me sick!

420
00:35:48,478 --> 00:35:51,189
JACK: Both of you just shut up!

421
00:35:51,314 --> 00:35:53,358
DENNIS: All right. Calm down.
PHIL: Come on.

422
00:35:53,817 --> 00:35:56,778
Getting excited won't make this go faster.

423
00:35:57,362 --> 00:36:00,782
Just relax. Try to be
a little bit more like Phil.

424
00:36:04,786 --> 00:36:07,080
JACK: What do we got here? Poetry.

425
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:10,917
JACK: We have a poet on board.
DANNY: May I have my book?

426
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,919
VAL: Read us a poem, Danny.

427
00:36:16,589 --> 00:36:18,341
No, nothing's finished.

428
00:36:18,424 --> 00:36:20,635
VIRGE: I didn't know you wrote.
Read something.

429
00:36:20,718 --> 00:36:22,887
RASCAL: I want to hear some poetry.

430
00:36:23,221 --> 00:36:26,349
DENNIS: Don't be shy.
VAL: Read something you've started.

431
00:36:27,225 --> 00:36:29,769
RASCAL: We got a regular Shakespeare
on board.

432
00:36:32,272 --> 00:36:35,233
CLAY: You got a good tone, Jack.
RASCAL: Tone deaf.

433
00:36:42,866 --> 00:36:46,494
"I know that I shall meet my fate
Somewhere among the clouds above"

00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:47,954

LIEUTENANT: Captain!

00:37:47,013 --> 00:37:51,100
You're going up! Start engines
in five minutes! Five minutes!

446
00:37:59,567 --> 00:38:00,985
Lieutenant.

447
00:38:01,736 --> 00:38:05,031
If you want to, you can come back
and fire my gun.

448
00:38:05,156 --> 00:38:07,533
- I'm not giving you my dog.
- Lieutenant...

449
00:38:07,658 --> 00:38:10,787
... I don't want
that flea-bitten mangy old pooch.

450
00:38:12,747 --> 00:38:14,832
VIRGE: Wake up. Time to go to work!

451
00:41:52,716 --> 00:41:54,468
Here we go, boys.

452
00:43:18,385 --> 00:43:22,222
Okay, Mona baby,
we're going to get us a nice 109 today.

453
00:43:22,306 --> 00:43:24,433
We did it before, we'll do it again.

454
00:43:24,516 --> 00:43:27,895
Sweet-talking your gun won't help.
Just straight shooting.

455
00:43:28,062 --> 00:43:29,813
Hey, shut up, Gene.

456
00:43:30,314 --> 00:43:32,483
When I got my two Nazi fighters...

457
00:43:32,566 --> 00:43:34,068
Hey, shut up!

458
00:43:42,201 --> 00:43:44,078
- Climb power.
- I know.

459
00:43:44,703 --> 00:43:47,039
- Watch the cowl flaps.
- I know!

460
00:43:58,509 --> 00:44:00,177
LUKE: Look out! Oh, my God!

461
00:44:34,503 --> 00:44:36,797
Luke, take over for a minute.

462
00:44:39,425 --> 00:44:43,554
Hey, it's Baby Ruth.
Who's our right wingman?

463
00:44:43,804 --> 00:44:45,556
Mother and Country.

464
00:44:45,764 --> 00:44:48,267
Oh, swell. The rookie crew.

465
00:44:49,268 --> 00:44:51,478
- Soup?
- No, thank you, sir.

466
00:44:52,062 --> 00:44:54,022
Luke?

467
00:44:58,068 --> 00:45:00,154
Captain, okay if I arm my bombs?

468
00:45:00,404 --> 00:45:02,197
<i>DENNIS: Yeah, go ahead. </i>

469
00:45:03,115 --> 00:45:04,700
Val, take this.

470
00:45:04,825 --> 00:45:07,744
VAL: You're not going to die.
PHIL: Just in case.

471
00:45:07,911 --> 00:45:11,206
You're flak-happy.
Just do your job and shut up!

472
00:45:27,181 --> 00:45:28,682
VAL: Bombs armed.

473
00:45:28,765 --> 00:45:31,935
VIRGE: Rascal, there's nothing wrong
with the ball turret.

474
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,854
RASCAL: Don't worry about it.

475
00:45:33,937 --> 00:45:35,647
VIRGE: I'm just doing my job.

476
00:45:35,731 --> 00:45:38,358
RASCAL: Now you do it.
Thanks a lot, buddy.

477
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,278
VIRGE: Okay?
RASCAL: Yes, thank you!

478
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:00,839
We're at 10,000 feet.
Let's hear those oxygen checks.

479
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,425
<i>LUKE: Clay, how you doing? </i>

480
00:46:04,301 --> 00:46:06,428
<i>CLAY: Well, I'm just fine, Lieutenant. </i>

481
00:46:18,607 --> 00:46:22,194
<i>PHIL: We're exactly five miles
south southwest of Yarmouth. </i>

482
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:25,113
<i>We're in formation. This is the rally point. </i>

483
00:46:27,449 --> 00:46:30,202
<i>DENNIS: Okay, boys. We're on our way. </i>

484
00:47:04,945 --> 00:47:07,406
<i>DENNIS: Listen. 
I'm showing 30 below zero here. </i>

485
00:47:07,698 --> 00:47:09,241
<i>Let's be careful. </i>

486
00:47:09,324 --> 00:47:12,869
<i>Don't touch your guns with bare hands
or they'll freeze right to it. </i>

487
00:47:12,995 --> 00:47:15,664
<i>I don't want anyone losing any fingers. </i>

488
00:47:15,747 --> 00:47:18,208
<i>Check your masks for frozen saliva. </i>

489
00:47:18,291 --> 00:47:23,046
<i>The ice blocks your oxygen flow
and I don't want anyone passing out. </i>

490
00:47:23,171 --> 00:47:25,006
<i>RASCAL: In short, don't drool. </i>

491
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:27,384
<i>DENNIS: In short, check your mask, Rascal. </i>

492
00:47:27,843 --> 00:47:30,345
<i>All right, let's keep the intercom free. </i>

493
00:47:30,429 --> 00:47:34,850
<i>Call out those fighters and don't shout. 
We can hear you loud and clear. </i>

494
00:47:35,225 --> 00:47:39,020
<i>Let's make this our best run yet. 
One we can really be proud of. </i>

495
00:47:39,104 --> 00:47:40,731
<i>VAL: Right in the pickle barrel. </i>

496
00:47:40,856 --> 00:47:45,819
<i>DENNIS: Right. Keep your minds
on your job, work together, and stay alert. </i>

497
00:47:47,738 --> 00:47:51,074
<i>DANNY: Captain, I'm getting A. F. N. here. 
Can I put it on? </i>

498
00:47:51,825 --> 00:47:53,118
<i>VIRGE: Please, sir. </i>

499
00:47:53,201 --> 00:47:56,204
<i>DENNIS: All right, 
but when I say that's enough... </i>

500
00:48:24,024 --> 00:48:26,401
JACK: "I hear gypsy violins"

501
00:48:27,777 --> 00:48:29,529
<i>EUGENE: Lord have mercy, Jack. </i>

502
00:48:29,613 --> 00:48:33,366
<i>SINGER:
"When you dance with me I'm in heaven"</i>

503
00:48:35,243 --> 00:48:38,830
<i>RASCAL: Heaven? Come to my bunk, 
I'll give you heaven, honey. </i>

504
00:48:54,763 --> 00:48:56,890
<i>DENNIS: Okay, let's test our guns. </i>

505
00:49:14,199 --> 00:49:16,284
<i>VIRGE: Little friends, three o'clock high. </i>

506
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,922
<i>LUKE: Oh, God. 
I'd give anything to fly a fighter. </i>

507
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:34,719
<i>You're all alone. You can do anything
you want. That's flying. </i>

508
00:49:34,844 --> 00:49:38,890
- It's the best pen money can buy.
- Why can't I have the baseball cards?

509
00:49:39,015 --> 00:49:41,309
They're for him. Here, Jack.

510
00:49:41,434 --> 00:49:45,021
JACK: I'm more of a football fan myself.
You know the Bears?

511
00:49:47,816 --> 00:49:49,985
PHIL: Here! Happy?
BOTH: Yeah!

512
00:49:50,068 --> 00:49:52,237
EUGENE: Thanks, Jack!
JACK: Thanks, Genie!

513

<i>ROOKIE: Mother and Country
calling Memphis Belle. </i>

<i>DANNY: Read you. What's wrong? </i>

515
00:49:59,577 --> 00:50:01,538
<i>ROOKIE: Nothing. I just had a question. </i>

516
00:50:01,621 --> 00:50:04,374
<i>DANNY: We can only use the radio
in an emergency. </i>

517
00:50:04,499 --> 00:50:06,751
<i>ROOKIE: Sorry. It was about my log book. </i>

518
00:50:06,876 --> 00:50:10,422
<i>ROOKIE: Should I write down every radio
communication, or just some? </i>

519
00:50:10,505 --> 00:50:13,842
<i>DANNY: Write everything. 
Later you'll figure out what's important. </i>

520
00:50:13,925 --> 00:50:17,512
<i>DANNY: We better sign off. 
ROOKIE: Thanks. I won't bother you again. </i>

521
00:50:17,595 --> 00:50:20,390
<i>DANNY: Smile. 
I'm going to take your picture. </i>

522
00:50:27,814 --> 00:50:29,566
<i>Hope it comes out. </i>

523
00:50:31,026 --> 00:50:34,654
<i>DENNIS: We're nearing enemy territory, 
so be on guard. </i>

524
00:50:34,946 --> 00:50:37,824
<i>Call out the fighters when you see them. </i>

<i>EUGENE: Clay, you sang great last night. </i>

526
00:50:40,076 --> 00:50:45,081
<i>You should go to Hollywood and get
a record contract like Frank Sinatra. </i>

527

we knew you when. </i>

528

down. Luke should go to Hollywood. </i>

529
00:50:54,299 --> 00:50:55,967
<i>CLAY: He could star in the movies. </i>

<i>LUKE: Maybe. Maybe. </i>

531

after the war, except not work. </i>

532
00:51:03,975 --> 00:51:08,188
<i>RASCAL: Why go back to the daily grind
of being a lifeguard? Take it easy. </i>

533
00:51:08,813 --> 00:51:10,732
<i>VIRGE: I know exactly what I'll do. </i>

<i>RASCAL: Virge, one more word about
that stupid restaurant... </i>

a plan. What'll you do, Rascal? </i>

536
00:51:19,157 --> 00:51:20,992
<i>RASCAL: Rob your restaurant. </i>

537

you going to be, Val? </i>

What'll he be after the war? </i>

541
00:51:33,254 --> 00:51:35,131
<i>VAL: I know. A mortician. </i>

542
00:51:39,677 --> 00:51:44,015
<i>DENNIS: Fellows, think about this. 
My family has a furniture business. </i>

and get us out safe. </i>

741
01:05:59,953 --> 01:06:04,541
<i>I'll need all the help you can give, 
so let's tighten up and be on our toes. </i>

742
01:06:04,666 --> 01:06:08,628
<i>We're three minutes and thirty seconds
from the bomb run. </i>

743
01:06:24,352 --> 01:06:25,562
<i>VAL: One o'clock! </i>

744
01:06:25,812 --> 01:06:27,355
<i>VAL: Ball turret, watch out. </i>

745
01:06:33,611 --> 01:06:36,531
<i>RASCAL: I'm jammed! He's coming at me! </i>

<i>RASCAL: Help me! </i>

747

<i>RASCAL: He's coming at me! </i>

748
01:06:47,792 --> 01:06:49,210
<i>RASCAL: And your mother, too! </i>

749
01:06:51,379 --> 01:06:52,547
Damn!

750
01:07:02,223 --> 01:07:04,475
<i>EUGENE: Jack's hit! </i>

751
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:06,352
<i>DENNIS: Val, go take a look at Jack. </i>

752
01:07:06,436 --> 01:07:08,563
<i>VAL: I'm two minutes from the bomb run. </i>

753
01:07:08,646 --> 01:07:10,523
<i>DENNIS: Gene, take care of it. </i>

754
01:07:10,607 --> 01:07:12,984
EUGENE: Hold still! Let me look!

755
01:07:20,575 --> 01:07:22,327
What are you laughing about?

756
01:07:22,410 --> 01:07:24,370
It's a scratch! It's nothing!

757
01:07:24,454 --> 01:07:26,998
You're screaming like a stuck pig.

758
01:07:29,959 --> 01:07:32,295
They destroyed my favorite harmonica.

759
01:07:32,629 --> 01:07:35,256
Oh, you rotten sons of bitches!

760
01:07:37,592 --> 01:07:40,970
You son of a bitch.
You scared the shit out of me.

761
01:07:50,313 --> 01:07:52,065
How'd you do that?

762
01:07:53,775 --> 01:07:55,443
Magic.

763
01:07:56,486 --> 01:07:59,781
<i>VAL: Flak! Twelve o'clock level. 
Here we go. </i>

764
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:07,080
<i>LUKE: They got about 500 antiaircraft guns
around Bremen. </i>

765
01:08:07,205 --> 01:08:09,749
<i>VIRGE: I could live without knowing that. </i>

766
01:08:09,916 --> 01:08:12,627
<i>JACK: Clay, what are the odds
of us getting out alive? </i>

767
01:08:13,503 --> 01:08:15,797
<i>CLAY: I was just figuring that out. </i>

768
01:08:16,631 --> 01:08:17,590
<i>CLAY: Damn. </i>

769
01:08:19,008 --> 01:08:20,259
<i>RASCAL: Jeez... </i>

770
01:08:20,551 --> 01:08:22,053
<i>DENNIS: What's wrong? </i>

771
01:08:22,136 --> 01:08:25,223
<i>RASCAL: A big piece of Nazi flak
just hit my turret. </i>

772
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:27,517
<i>DENNIS: Are you okay? 
RASCAL: I guess. </i>

773
01:08:27,684 --> 01:08:29,936
<i>DENNIS: You guess or you are? 
RASCAL: I am! </i>

774
01:08:30,019 --> 01:08:33,690
<i>DENNIS: OK. I hope everybody's wearing
their flak jackets. </i>

775
01:08:41,656 --> 01:08:44,659
<i>ROOKIE:
Mother and Country calling Memphis Belle. </i>

776
01:08:44,742 --> 01:08:48,830
<i>ROOKIE: This flak is not like I expected. 
Can't we fly above it? </i>

777
01:08:48,996 --> 01:08:52,583
<i>DANNY: No, we got to fly straight
through it or we'll be off target. </i>

778
01:08:52,834 --> 01:08:54,669
<i>DANNY: It's just four minutes. </i>

779
01:08:54,961 --> 01:08:56,462
<i>ROOKIE: Yeah, just. </i>

780
01:09:14,772 --> 01:09:17,692
<i>DENNIS: Bombardier, 
I'm turning on the autopilot. </i>

781
01:09:18,317 --> 01:09:21,112
<i>DENNIS: You're flying the plane
from here to target. </i>

782
01:09:21,529 --> 01:09:22,697
<i>DENNIS: She's all yours. </i>

783
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:23,990
<i>VAL: Roger. </i>

784
01:09:31,497 --> 01:09:33,166
<i>DENNIS: Hold her steady. </i>

785
01:09:33,666 --> 01:09:36,377
<i>LUKE: I've never seen it this thick before. </i>

786
01:09:38,546 --> 01:09:40,423
DENNIS: Luke's hit! Luke's hit!

787
01:09:40,548 --> 01:09:42,675
LUKE: Dennis is hit!
DENNIS: It's not me!

788
01:09:43,009 --> 01:09:45,678
It's not me. It must be you.
I think he's in shock.

789
01:09:45,761 --> 01:09:47,346
No, you're in shock!

790
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:49,515
Val, get up here, quick!

791
01:09:49,599 --> 01:09:50,850
<i>VAL: I'm on the bomb run. </i>

792
01:09:50,933 --> 01:09:52,518
It's definitely not me!

793
01:09:52,602 --> 01:09:54,103
It's definitely not me!

794
01:09:54,187 --> 01:09:56,564
DENNIS: Someone's blood
is all over the cockpit!

795
01:09:56,647 --> 01:09:58,691
Captain, it's tomato soup.

796
01:10:06,449 --> 01:10:07,617
What was that?

797
01:10:09,785 --> 01:10:12,788
<i>RASCAL: There's a hole
as big as my dick in the left wing. </i>

798
01:10:13,497 --> 01:10:15,249
We're losing fuel!

799
01:10:16,292 --> 01:10:18,336
DENNIS: Get on the fuel transfer pump!

800
01:10:22,965 --> 01:10:26,636
The electrics must be out on the left side!
I'll do it by hand!

801
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:30,139
Luke, get back there!
Save as much fuel as we can!

802
01:10:30,223 --> 01:10:31,891
<i>VAL: Two minutes to target. </i>

803
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:42,985
<i>VAL: Bomb bay doors open. </i>

804
01:10:54,288 --> 01:10:56,248
LUKE: Virge!
VIRGE: OK.

805
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:09,887
<i>VAL: Bombardier to pilot. Target is
covered. Looks like a smoke screen. </i>

806
01:11:09,971 --> 01:11:12,890
Fuel transfer complete. We saved a little.

807
01:11:14,266 --> 01:11:16,310
<i>DENNIS: How does that target look? </i>

808
01:11:17,103 --> 01:11:19,146
<i>VAL: Target totally obscured. </i>

809
01:11:21,357 --> 01:11:23,234
<i>VAL: Thirty seconds to target. </i>

810
01:11:46,465 --> 01:11:50,344
<i>DENNIS: I need those bombs on target. 
The whole group is bombing with us. </i>

811
01:11:50,428 --> 01:11:52,680
<i>VAL: If I can't see, I can't see! </i>

812
01:11:59,645 --> 01:12:01,105
What are you doing?

813
01:12:02,189 --> 01:12:06,068
We're going to bomb the factory,
even if it means going around again.

814
01:12:06,152 --> 01:12:10,322
That's suicide! It's asking the Nazis
to blow us out of the sky!

815
01:12:10,448 --> 01:12:12,032
Luke, I'm in command!

816
01:12:14,326 --> 01:12:15,828
<i>VAL: Captain, what do I do? </i>

817
01:12:30,426 --> 01:12:32,219
<i>DENNIS: Bombardier, report. </i>

818
01:12:32,762 --> 01:12:34,430
<i>VAL: Visibility zero. </i>

819
01:12:36,599 --> 01:12:38,476
If you do, we're dead!

820
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,523
<i>DENNIS: We're going again. 
LUKE: Damn!</i>

821
01:12:44,607 --> 01:12:47,193
<i>DENNIS: Danny, get me C Channel
to talk to Group. </i>

822
01:12:54,992 --> 01:12:56,285
<i>VAL: Get off! </i>

823
01:12:58,621 --> 01:13:00,956
PHIL: Just drop them, Val.
VAL: Shut up!

824
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:03,959
PHIL: Please.

825
01:13:08,923 --> 01:13:11,759
<i>DENNIS: It's five minutes to the start
of the bomb run. </i>

826
01:13:11,842 --> 01:13:13,844
<i>Navigator, give me a position. </i>

827
01:13:15,179 --> 01:13:17,264
<i>DENNIS: Navigator! Did you hear me? </i>

828
01:13:17,348 --> 01:13:18,682
PHIL: Yes, sir.

829
01:13:23,646 --> 01:13:25,231
<i>DENNIS: Everybody listen. </i>

830
01:13:25,314 --> 01:13:28,525
<i>I know you want to drop the bombs
and get out. </i>

831
01:13:28,651 --> 01:13:31,695
<i>But there's civilians down there. A school. </i>

832
01:13:31,779 --> 01:13:35,199
<i>If we don't drop the bombs on target, 
innocent people will be killed. </i>

833
01:13:35,282 --> 01:13:37,159
<i>LUKE: So what? They're all Nazis! </i>

834
01:13:37,284 --> 01:13:38,577
<i>DENNIS: Shut up! </i>

835
01:13:41,163 --> 01:13:45,251
<i>I don't want to do this any more than you. 
We were sent to bomb a factory. </i>

836
01:13:46,377 --> 01:13:50,673
<i>DENNIS: If we don't do it, someone
will have to come back and do it for us. </i>

837
01:13:51,423 --> 01:13:57,304
<i>Nobody said this would be fun and games. 
It's our job. Ours. Nobody else's. </i>

838
01:13:58,555 --> 01:14:00,224
<i>DENNIS: If we do this right... </i>

839
01:14:00,307 --> 01:14:02,810
<i>... we can always be proud of it. </i>

840
01:14:03,018 --> 01:14:05,938
<i>That's all I want, fellows. Believe me. </i>

841
01:14:07,982 --> 01:14:11,819
<i>DENNIS: Let's get back to work. 
Call out those fighters. </i>

842
01:14:27,543 --> 01:14:29,253
<i>VIRGE: Bandits, three o'clock high! </i>

<i>EUGENE: Bandit, 12 o'clock high. 
Look out, Cockpit, he's heading for you. </i>

848
01:15:04,455 --> 01:15:05,956
<i>LUKE: What, should I spit on him? </i>

849
01:15:12,296 --> 01:15:13,881
<i>LUKE: Tail gunner, how you doing? </i>

850

Why can't someone else?
Left waist, right waist?

<i>JACK: We got fighters
all over us back here. </i>

I'm the only one not doing anything.

859
01:15:43,577 --> 01:15:44,912
Make it fast.

860

Nice view you got here. </i>

I don't know anything!

Thanks, Luke.

Once in a while I do something right.

He's lost a lot of blood.

EUGENE: How far is it to base?

956
01:27:16,394 --> 01:27:18,729
On three engines,
two or two-and-a-half hours.

957
01:27:18,813 --> 01:27:21,315
Two-and-a-half hours? He'll never make it.

- Val, help him!
- What do you want from me?

959
01:27:23,692 --> 01:27:27,113
He needs a hospital.
All I have is a first-aid kit.

960
01:27:35,246 --> 01:27:37,039
EUGENE: Here you go, Danny.

961

Okay, there's one more thing we can do.

962
01:27:40,876 --> 01:27:42,128
RASCAL: What? Let's do it.

963
01:27:42,211 --> 01:27:44,171
Put a parachute on him and push him out.

964
01:27:44,255 --> 01:27:46,424
- Jesus!
- It's crawling with Germans down there.

965
01:27:46,507 --> 01:27:50,177
VAL: They'll take him to a hospital.
RASCAL: If they don't kill him for fun.

966
01:27:50,261 --> 01:27:53,681
It's his only chance! Another crew did it.

967
01:27:53,764 --> 01:27:56,308
- He was conscious.
- Danny can't pull the cord.

968
01:27:56,392 --> 01:27:57,852
VAL: We can pull it first.

969
01:27:57,935 --> 01:28:00,354
- He could fall in a lake and drown.
- Can't we wait?

970
01:28:00,437 --> 01:28:03,524
We'll be over the North Sea in 10 minutes.
It'll be too late.

We're going to do it, we have to do it now.

RASCAL: Watch his back.
EUGENE: Keep his head up.

EUGENE: Don't push!
JACK: Be careful.

974
01:28:17,621 --> 01:28:21,250
I'll go along with anything you say.
You're the doctor.

975
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:25,254

- Phil! I don't want any argument.

- It's his only chance.

978
01:28:33,220 --> 01:28:36,307
No, you're his only chance,
but you're too chicken to help him!

979
01:28:36,390 --> 01:28:40,227
VAL: If he stays on board, he'll die.
PHIL: If you throw him out he'll die.

980
01:28:49,028 --> 01:28:50,571
PHIL: You can save him!

981
01:28:50,696 --> 01:28:55,159
So what if you're not a doctor yet?
You can help him. I know you can.

982
01:28:55,242 --> 01:28:57,745
PHIL: He needs you! He's going to die!

983

I know you're scared. </i>

CREWMAN 4: Did you get the one there?

990
01:30:02,810 --> 01:30:05,270
- How many so far?
- Nine.

991
01:30:06,438 --> 01:30:08,107
There's another one.

992
01:30:08,190 --> 01:30:09,566
The Belle?

993
01:30:10,734 --> 01:30:12,444
No, sir, not yet.

994
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:20,244
Feather prop. Cut fuel.

Listen, we're flying on two engines now.

996
01:30:25,124 --> 01:30:30,170
Let's lighten up. Throw out everything.
We're close to home, so lose your guns.

997
01:30:30,671 --> 01:30:33,340
We never did get that fighter, did we?

998

Oh, shit on a stick! Fuck!

999
01:30:37,845 --> 01:30:42,057
Lord have mercy.
You can have my bullets, too.

1000
