1
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:14,796
Okay, let's see who we got here.
(Revised by gi0001tw at
http://www.pfmovie.com)

2
00:01:16,128 --> 00:01:19,040
Virge Hoogesteger.
What kind of name is that?

3
00:01:19,127 --> 00:01:22,516
Youngest of six.
Worked in the family diner before joining.

4
00:01:22,608 --> 00:01:25,963
Writes home every week.
Nicknamed ''The Virgin. ''

5
00:01:29,127 --> 00:01:30,798
Who's this goon?

6
00:01:30,927 --> 00:01:33,281
Jack Bocci from Chicago.

7
00:01:33,447 --> 00:01:35,880
Graduate of several reform schools.

8
00:01:35,968 --> 00:01:38,401
Better keep him in the background.

9
00:01:40,928 --> 00:01:44,283
This is the religious one.
There's always a religious one.

10
00:01:44,407 --> 00:01:48,160
Eugene McVey from Cleveland.
There's always one from Cleveland.

11
00:01:48,247 --> 00:01:51,921
Nineteen, high-strung,
always coming down with something.

12
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:54,236
How'd he get in this bunch?

13
00:01:56,208 --> 00:02:00,644
Richard ''Rascal'' Moore.
Eighteen, 5' 4'', 120 pounds.

14
00:02:00,727 --> 00:02:03,240
Has a real reputation as a ladies' man.

15
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:05,596
At least, that's what he says.

16
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,486
Clay Busby, a farmer's son.

17
00:02:09,968 --> 00:02:12,242
When his father lost their farm
in a poker game...

18
00:02:12,328 --> 00:02:15,319
...Clay started playing piano
in a New Orleans cathouse.

19
00:02:15,608 --> 00:02:17,563
The papers'll love that.

20
00:02:18,887 --> 00:02:22,561
This kid couldn't be more Irish if he tried,
Danny Daly.

21
00:02:22,687 --> 00:02:25,564
A student, editor of the school paper,
valedictorian.

22
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:29,355
He volunteered the day
after he graduated from college.

23
00:02:30,248 --> 00:02:33,922
That's not bad. I think we got something
to work with here.

24
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,599
They're coming in!

25
00:02:53,928 --> 00:02:57,203
-That's 15, 16!
-There's another one!

26
00:03:04,568 --> 00:03:06,523
At this point, 15 or 16.

27
00:03:07,568 --> 00:03:10,559
They're still coming in.
How can I promise 24 planes tomorrow?

28
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,115
I don't know if they'll all make it back.

29
00:03:13,649 --> 00:03:14,797
Where?

30
00:03:16,168 --> 00:03:18,965
I thought we hit that target a month ago.

31
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:24,198
I know we have to keep the pressure on,
but I lost almost a quarter of my squadron.

32
00:03:26,968 --> 00:03:28,480
Yes, sir.

33
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:31,122
I'll have the ground crews work
through the night.

34
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:35,759
I'd hoped to give the boys a break.
We're having a dance tonight in honor--

35
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:40,361
Yes, sir.

36
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:43,636
I will update you when I know more.

37
00:03:44,168 --> 00:03:46,158
Thank you, sir. Good-bye.

38
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:49,767
Sir, eighteen planes, three still out.

39
00:04:03,649 --> 00:04:05,843
So, that's the crew of the Memphis Belle?

40
00:04:05,928 --> 00:04:09,044
The enlisted men.
You'll meet the officers this afternoon.

41
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,804
They must be the 10 luckiest
sons of bitches in the world.

42
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:16,085
-They're just ordinary men.
-Are you kidding?

43
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:22,001
Ordinary? First they volunteer for all this.

44
00:04:22,088 --> 00:04:26,603
Then they fly 24 missions without
a scratch. Doesn't sound ordinary to me.

45
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:28,407
Two more, sir.

46
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:40,118
People back home are getting discouraged
by our losses.

47
00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:43,081
They're thinking daylight bombing
is a mistake.

48
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:46,723
-It's the only way we'll win this war.
-We must get that message across.

49
00:04:46,809 --> 00:04:48,241
That's where I come in.

50
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,717
The nation will fall in love with those boys.

51
00:04:50,809 --> 00:04:54,642
The first crew in the Eighth Air Force
to complete their tour of duty.

52
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:56,526
-They haven't done it yet.
-They will.

53
00:04:56,609 --> 00:04:58,917
You'll make sure of that, right?

54
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:06,998
One more.

55
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,688
Just one more.

56
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,886
It'd be great if everyone came back today,
with the dance and all.

57
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:13,806
I give them four to one.

58
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:15,881
Any takers?

59
00:05:16,489 --> 00:05:17,967
I'll have some of that.

60
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,688
-Show me your money.
-Genie, loan me some money.

61
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,158
-Do I look like Wells Fargo?
-You look like a weenie.

62
00:05:23,249 --> 00:05:24,567
There it is!

63
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:29,524
I heard there's a swell band for the dance.

64
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:31,963
Clay, maybe they'll let you croon a tune.

65
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:33,640
You sing in the plane all the time.

66
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,765
Yeah, but you guys got no taste.

67
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,124
Come on, hurry up!

68
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:19,727
Let's get out of here!

69
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,047
So, you named the plane
after your girl back home? Right?

70
00:06:47,411 --> 00:06:48,809
It's a great angle.

71
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:51,245
You don't sound
like you're from the South, Captain.

72
00:06:51,331 --> 00:06:53,366
I met her when I was in Memphis
on business.

73
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:56,088
I bet she's a living doll, eh, Dennis?

74
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,121
She's a fine woman, sir.

75
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,604
A lifeguard?
That's a pretty responsible job, Luke.

76
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,517
It's rough basking in the sun all day,
having girls swarm all over you.

77
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,248
I joined up to get away from all that.

78
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,244
That's good!

79
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,964
Val. What is that short for?

80
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:18,409
Valentine!

81
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:21,368
I bet women love that.

82
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:24,362
Now, you're the bombardier, and...

83
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,123
...I understand you've had four years
of medical school.

84
00:07:27,211 --> 00:07:30,168
-Well--
-When your picture is in Life magazine...

85
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,083
...every man and woman in America
will want you to be their doctor.

86
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,760
Look at the camera, Phil.

87
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:40,522
Sit up straight.

88
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,638
Smile.

89
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,960
What is there to smile about?

90
00:07:46,051 --> 00:07:50,202
One more mission and you get to go home.
That'd make me smile.

91
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:52,682
Well, you're not me.

92
00:07:52,811 --> 00:07:55,005
Please just take the picture.

93
00:07:56,411 --> 00:07:58,002
-Is that all, sir?
-Not quite.

94
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,527
You'll go back home in the Belle.

95
00:08:00,611 --> 00:08:05,081
Fly all over the US, making speeches,
getting people to buy more war bonds...

96
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:08,008
...work longer hours, put out more planes.

97
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:11,600
And, believe me,
you'll be wined, womened, and songed...

98
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,079
...from one end of the States to the other.

99
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:17,805
It'll be tough,
but we all have to make sacrifices.

100
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,158
We'll be famous?

101
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:20,842
Afraid so, Luke.

102
00:08:22,931 --> 00:08:24,409
Colonel Derringer?

103
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:26,725
I'm Army PR. Call me Bruce.

104
00:08:28,171 --> 00:08:30,001
We'll follow your orders--

105
00:08:30,091 --> 00:08:33,446
These are not orders.
We're working together on this.

106
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:37,479
Fine. But I don't want the other men
finding out about this.

107
00:08:37,571 --> 00:08:41,722
Pictures in Life? Wine, women and song?
You got to tell them, they'll go nuts.

108
00:08:41,811 --> 00:08:45,246
I don't want them going nuts.
I want them thinking of their jobs.

109
00:08:45,332 --> 00:08:48,801
We could do our jobs in our sleep.
Why can't they know?

110
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,242
Because I said so.

111
00:08:54,211 --> 00:08:56,280
My father used to say that.

112
00:08:58,852 --> 00:09:03,322
Dennis, you're the boss. You tell the crew
whenever you think it's right.

113
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:06,564
Now, can we have just one more shot?

114
00:09:07,452 --> 00:09:09,840
What? Are you kidding me?

115
00:09:11,132 --> 00:09:14,760
What are you smiling about?
You brought this unclean deck.

116
00:09:15,252 --> 00:09:19,164
Okay, get your money.
Once again, Jack Bocci gets stiffed.

117
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:26,320
Clay, shouldn't you let the Sarge
go through Becker's stuff?

118
00:09:26,411 --> 00:09:30,403
He'll send it all to his widow. We don't
want her getting anything embarrassing.

119
00:09:30,492 --> 00:09:32,004
-Candy bar.
-Me.

120
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:35,167
Danny, which one do you like better?

121
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,724
This one's shiny aluminum. Very modern.

122
00:09:37,932 --> 00:09:42,527
This one's a little more homey,
with the brick and the little bushes.

123
00:09:42,612 --> 00:09:44,090
This one. Why?

124
00:09:44,372 --> 00:09:48,569
I'm going to open a bunch of restaurants
exactly like the first one.

125
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:51,450
You'd get the exact same burger
in Detroit...

126
00:09:51,532 --> 00:09:53,681
...as you got in Baltimore or Philadelphia.

127
00:09:53,772 --> 00:09:56,649
Nobody wants the same food
wherever they go.

128
00:09:56,932 --> 00:09:59,161
Sure they do. It's comforting.

129
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:06,047
-It is comforting.
-Love letters.

130
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:09,163
-Wife or girlfriend?
-Read them aloud.

131
00:10:09,252 --> 00:10:10,604
Girlfriend.

132
00:10:10,972 --> 00:10:13,201
Pocket knife. Photos.

133
00:10:13,372 --> 00:10:14,963
Any clean socks?

134
00:10:16,812 --> 00:10:18,847
-Dirty book!
-I'll take it.

135
00:10:22,732 --> 00:10:24,005
Hey, look!

136
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:26,681
-Becker forgot his good luck charm.
-Poor slob.

137
00:10:26,772 --> 00:10:29,444
Should have worn it around his neck.
He'd never forget it.

138
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:31,011
-Rubbers.
-Dibs!

139
00:10:32,172 --> 00:10:36,687
Virge the Virgin won't need these. Swear
you'll tell me if you lose your cherry.

140
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:38,329
I'll send it to you COD.

141
00:10:38,413 --> 00:10:42,121
-Clay, give me. Becker owed me $10.
-Don't take his money.

142
00:10:42,492 --> 00:10:44,721
Clam up, mug-face. He owed me.

143
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:46,449
What do you know about Germany?

144
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:48,090
-Pretty women.
-Good beer.

145
00:10:48,172 --> 00:10:50,480
The hamburger's named after a town there.

146
00:10:51,493 --> 00:10:55,201
A little bird tells me
that's where they're sending us tomorrow.

147
00:10:55,293 --> 00:10:58,568
-Are you sure?
-We ain't going. Our plane's broke.

148
00:10:58,732 --> 00:11:01,165
-It's fixed.
-Let's go break it.

149
00:11:01,252 --> 00:11:05,210
-They wouldn't send us there our last time.
-They'd send us on a milk run to France.

150
00:11:05,293 --> 00:11:06,611
I hope so.

151
00:11:07,092 --> 00:11:08,160
They would.

152
00:11:08,253 --> 00:11:11,324
Anybody want the rest of this stuff?
Who wants the cigarettes?

153
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:13,208
Let me take the razor blades.

154
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:00,963
I'm sending this to your wife!

155
00:12:03,174 --> 00:12:05,687
We may be going to Germany tomorrow.

156
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:09,242
My short, young life could be snuffed out
in an instant.

157
00:12:10,013 --> 00:12:12,128
I volunteered thinking it would be fun.

158
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:13,970
I never thought....

159
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:15,760
Oh, Faith!

160
00:12:15,854 --> 00:12:17,844
When I think I may never see the stars...

161
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:20,162
...listen to good music, or...

162
00:12:21,254 --> 00:12:24,006
...talk to a beautiful girl like you.

163
00:12:24,413 --> 00:12:25,731
I'm sorry.

164
00:12:26,173 --> 00:12:28,811
You need a drink. I'll be right back.

165
00:12:31,013 --> 00:12:35,130
Danny, she is crazy about me.
She's going to jump on me any second.

166
00:12:39,894 --> 00:12:40,769
Had enough?

167
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:43,446
How come they brought Life magazine?
To jinx us?

168
00:12:43,534 --> 00:12:46,889
Forget about it.
Let's get a couple girls and dance.

169
00:12:47,294 --> 00:12:50,365
Tell me the truth. The truth.
Are you scared?

170
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:52,167
No.

171
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,043
I'm Val. Come on.

172
00:12:58,734 --> 00:13:03,204
It's my favorite food in the world!
You've never had a burger? Unbelievable!

173
00:13:03,294 --> 00:13:06,126
-You don't know what you're missing.
-They sound wonderful.

174
00:13:06,213 --> 00:13:08,885
It's been so long since I had any meat.

175
00:13:10,214 --> 00:13:14,092
I work the meat very slowly, very tenderly.
That's the secret.

176
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:18,051
I rub in a little Worcestershire,
add garlic, a little thyme.

177
00:13:18,254 --> 00:13:22,212
Then I ease it into a patty, very gently,
so I don't bruise the meat.

178
00:13:22,574 --> 00:13:24,928
Virge, you're making me so hungry!

179
00:13:39,734 --> 00:13:43,089
We're going to have to excite people
on this bond tour. Inspire them.

180
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:47,447
Now, Dennis is a fine man,
but he doesn't have your enthusiasm.

181
00:13:47,534 --> 00:13:49,728
I'm a qualified pilot, same as him.

182
00:13:49,814 --> 00:13:51,326
They didn't have a plane ready...

183
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:54,804
...so he's the big shot pilot
and I'm in the dummy seat.

184
00:13:56,214 --> 00:13:58,966
You're no dummy, Luke.
We both know that.

185
00:14:01,655 --> 00:14:02,973
Being captain?

186
00:14:03,574 --> 00:14:07,532
Well, you've got nine men
who are totally depending on you.

187
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:12,167
What did you do before the war?
I was in the furniture business.

188
00:14:12,455 --> 00:14:15,252
This isn't like making furniture,
see what I mean?

189
00:14:20,574 --> 00:14:23,246
-I'm not making sense.
-No, you are.

190
00:14:24,534 --> 00:14:27,889
Thanks a lot, Captain.
I'm going to get back to my date.

191
00:15:18,815 --> 00:15:20,532
I'll miss you, gal.

192
00:15:24,815 --> 00:15:26,770
We've been together a long time.

193
00:15:28,175 --> 00:15:30,005
You never let me down.

194
00:15:30,895 --> 00:15:33,362
I can't say that about many people.

195
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,773
You know how to take care of your men.

196
00:15:39,175 --> 00:15:42,849
That's about the best thing
a fellow can say about any gal.

197
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,846
I can't believe it.

198
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:51,242
It's going to be over so soon.

199
00:15:54,856 --> 00:15:56,925
I can't imagine going home.

200
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:01,689
Home.

201
00:16:07,215 --> 00:16:09,284
Won't be the same, will it?

202
00:16:21,895 --> 00:16:23,247
Good night.

203
00:16:40,856 --> 00:16:43,369
Virge, I wish you'd talk to me like that.

204
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:47,013
The Captain'd murder me
if he caught us in here.

205
00:16:47,496 --> 00:16:49,167
Oh, jeez. Put that out.

206
00:16:49,296 --> 00:16:53,083
Come on. Let's get this over with
and get back to the dance.

207
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:55,170
Wait.

208
00:16:56,376 --> 00:16:57,774
There. It was that.

209
00:16:57,856 --> 00:17:00,323
My wrench! I was looking for it.
Where'd you find it?

210
00:17:01,016 --> 00:17:02,414
Under my bum.

211
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:05,688
Thanks. I thought someone had stolen it.

212
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:08,084
Virge, forget the bloody wrench.

213
00:17:10,736 --> 00:17:11,929
I'm sorry.

214
00:17:12,016 --> 00:17:13,573
Here, let me rub it.

215
00:17:13,656 --> 00:17:16,044
You've never done this, have you?

216
00:17:16,657 --> 00:17:19,045
Why? Am I doing something wrong?

217
00:17:22,336 --> 00:17:23,370
No.

218
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,966
Is that your brand new plane out there?

219
00:17:38,097 --> 00:17:41,009
-Yeah. Mother and Country.
-Mother and Country!

220
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:44,604
-We had our first practice today.
-How'd it go?

221
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:47,494
We need a couple more.
If you guys have any advice--

222
00:17:47,616 --> 00:17:50,448
Get a gun, shoot yourself in the foot,
and go home.

223
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,729
Now that's good advice.

224
00:17:51,816 --> 00:17:55,569
Are those size eight? How about
leaving a will saying when you get shot...

225
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:59,285
...on your first mission
that those nice new pumps come to me?

226
00:18:15,697 --> 00:18:16,970
You okay?

227
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:21,167
Nerves, I guess.

228
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:24,046
We were just fooling around.

229
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:26,445
I remember when I first got here.

230
00:18:26,657 --> 00:18:27,691
Same thing.

231
00:18:28,097 --> 00:18:30,735
I'd give anything to be in your place.

232
00:18:30,817 --> 00:18:33,330
One more and you guys get to go home.

233
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:35,646
Sometimes I wish I could stay.

234
00:18:37,096 --> 00:18:39,734
Sounds crazy, but I'm used to it here.

235
00:18:40,736 --> 00:18:44,045
These guys....
These jerks are like brothers to me.

236
00:18:44,817 --> 00:18:46,807
I never had any brothers.

237
00:18:47,337 --> 00:18:49,372
I have four older sisters.

238
00:18:51,137 --> 00:18:54,094
When we get back home,
I don't know when we'll get together.

239
00:18:54,537 --> 00:18:56,367
We come from all over.

240
00:18:58,297 --> 00:19:01,094
I guess that's why
I keep taking their pictures.

241
00:19:02,777 --> 00:19:05,244
You'll be like that with your crew.

242
00:19:06,537 --> 00:19:08,128
Close your eyes.

243
00:19:12,897 --> 00:19:14,409
It's good luck.

244
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:34,049
Clay, now's your chance.
Go up there and sing!

245
00:19:34,138 --> 00:19:36,605
I'm not going to make a fool of myself.

246
00:19:36,737 --> 00:19:38,567
You're a great singer.

247
00:19:41,777 --> 00:19:43,687
Ladies and gentlemen...

248
00:19:44,897 --> 00:19:46,727
...we have...

249
00:19:46,938 --> 00:19:49,576
... 10 very special men here tonight.

250
00:19:51,018 --> 00:19:53,212
I'm sure you know who I mean.

251
00:19:53,738 --> 00:19:58,253
They're about to become the first crew
in the Eighth Air Force...

252
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,169
...to fly their 25th and final mission.

253
00:20:01,778 --> 00:20:05,008
Let's hear it for the crew
of the Memphis Belle!

254
00:20:06,618 --> 00:20:08,892
No, no. It's bad luck.

255
00:20:21,538 --> 00:20:25,291
Let's do Danny Boy in C,
and come in on the second chorus.

256
00:20:27,658 --> 00:20:29,170
Thank you, sir.

257
00:20:31,778 --> 00:20:35,053
This buddy of mine keeps begging me
to sing, and...

258
00:20:35,418 --> 00:20:39,809
...it looks like I ain't gonna get
out of it this time, so here it goes.

259
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,969
No, get back here.
You're not getting out of this.

260
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:55,170
I don't want to die.

261
00:21:58,499 --> 00:22:00,773
I don't want to die!

262
00:22:05,178 --> 00:22:06,929
I don't want to die!

263
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:31,808
Captain Dearborn.

264
00:22:31,939 --> 00:22:35,817
Mission today. Breakfast, 0600.
Briefing, 0645.

265
00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:38,287
-Lieutenant Sinclair?
-I'm up.

266
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,816
Where's Lieutenant Lowenthal?

267
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,497
Val, where's Phil?

268
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:48,448
In the can. He couldn't sleep.

269
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:51,246
-Nerves.
-Can't say I blame him.

270
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:53,135
Give them hell today.

271
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:22,017
Oh, no. I can see it. I get back home...

272
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:26,216
...I'm doing it to the wife, the door opens,
there's Danny taking a picture.

273
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:28,528
Anyone seen my St. Anthony medal?

274
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:32,736
-He's the patron saint of missing things.
-Yeah. I can't find him.

275
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:38,330
Chief, I need you over here to look at this.

276
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,090
Bogey, six o'clock low.

277
00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:45,886
-Good morning.
-Flying, Lieutenant?

278
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,409
-What, are you drunk?
-Why, are you?

279
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,930
-Are you kidding? We got a mission!
-I know. That's why.

280
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:57,491
See, I'm going to get it today.
My number's up, my luck's run out.

281
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,456
I'm gonna die, so I want
to give you something to remember me by.

282
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,892
Get ahold of yourself.

283
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,892
I don't want your watch!
We're counting on you!

284
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:10,369
Want my gold cuff links?
They got my initials on them.

285
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,212
You'll let everyone down.

286
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,212
Want my New York Yankee baseball cards?
I got DiMaggio.

287
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,057
What about my Rita Hayworth pin-up?

288
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,012
Stick your finger down your throat.

289
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,609
Stick your finger down your throat
or I'll do it for you!

290
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,858
I feel better.

291
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:43,578
Are you thinking of sneaking this on
the plane? I'm shocked at your behavior.

292
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,809
Virge goes out for the pass!

293
00:24:47,901 --> 00:24:49,856
Hey, wise guys! Knock it off!

294
00:24:49,941 --> 00:24:51,214
Found it.

295
00:25:05,021 --> 00:25:08,729
These powdered eggs would gag a buzzard.
You done with that?

296
00:25:08,821 --> 00:25:12,096
It'll be a milk run today.
I can feel it in my bones.

297
00:25:12,181 --> 00:25:16,253
-Last time they sent us to Wilhelmshaven.
-I hope they don't send us back there.

298
00:25:16,341 --> 00:25:19,491
They wouldn't do that.
Not to my mama's baby boy.

299
00:25:21,341 --> 00:25:22,898
Give them hell today.

300
00:25:23,461 --> 00:25:25,178
-Bacon?
-Yeah.

301
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,015
Eggs?

302
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,933
Give him extra. He's real hungry.

303
00:25:36,901 --> 00:25:38,572
Good morning, men.

304
00:25:38,981 --> 00:25:40,618
Everything all right?

305
00:25:41,101 --> 00:25:44,172
Stop it! You won't have a chance
to do that after today.

306
00:25:44,261 --> 00:25:46,933
I wouldn't be so sure about that. Right?

307
00:25:53,061 --> 00:25:56,211
Well, looks like we've all got the jitters
this morning.

308
00:25:56,461 --> 00:25:58,610
I'll see you after briefing.

309
00:26:06,101 --> 00:26:08,614
How will he get through briefing?

310
00:26:08,742 --> 00:26:10,652
On a wing and a prayer.

311
00:26:13,701 --> 00:26:16,498
I thought we'd have more practice
before we went up.

312
00:26:16,621 --> 00:26:18,133
You'll do fine.

313
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:20,973
Ten-hut!

314
00:26:24,901 --> 00:26:26,128
At ease.

315
00:26:29,701 --> 00:26:34,092
I hope you had a good time last night.
Now it's back to business.

316
00:26:39,421 --> 00:26:42,378
The target for today is Bremen.

317
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:50,973
We have a chance to make a difference
in this war...

318
00:26:51,062 --> 00:26:53,529
...so let's do the best job we can.

319
00:26:53,782 --> 00:26:56,170
Leave the rest in the hands of God.

320
00:26:56,342 --> 00:27:00,892
With luck, it'll all be over soon,
and we can go back home to our families.

321
00:27:00,981 --> 00:27:03,972
Good luck. Over to you, Major Comstock.

322
00:27:04,101 --> 00:27:06,773
Good morning. Sergeant, get the lights.

323
00:27:07,782 --> 00:27:09,737
This is our target area.

324
00:27:09,942 --> 00:27:13,331
They're long rectangular buildings.
The only rectangular ones there...

325
00:27:13,422 --> 00:27:18,131
...so you can't miss them. Note the
S-shaped road to the factory for sighting.

326
00:27:18,342 --> 00:27:22,573
The Flugzeugbauer factory is a major
assembly plant for 190 fighter planes.

327
00:27:22,942 --> 00:27:25,171
Now, you're leading the group today...

328
00:27:25,302 --> 00:27:27,974
...360 planes are bombing
on your command...

329
00:27:28,062 --> 00:27:31,258
...so let's be accurate.
This is a civilian area here.

330
00:27:31,622 --> 00:27:35,296
This is a hospital. These are houses.
This is a school and a playground.

331
00:27:35,382 --> 00:27:38,020
Note the railway tracks, north northwest.

332
00:27:40,982 --> 00:27:41,970
Bremen.

333
00:27:42,062 --> 00:27:44,450
Bremen? Oh, we're dead men.
We're dead.

334
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:46,930
-Shut up, Rascal!
-You shut up!

335
00:27:47,102 --> 00:27:49,296
Clay, what are the odds today?

336
00:27:49,382 --> 00:27:51,451
They'll overload us with bombs...

337
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:54,851
...so it's 30 to 1 we'll crash
and blow up on takeoff.

338
00:27:54,982 --> 00:27:57,654
They'll throw every fighter they got at us--

339
00:27:57,783 --> 00:28:00,580
-Skip the gory details.
-Basically, we're finished.

340
00:28:00,662 --> 00:28:02,174
Chief's coming.

341
00:30:14,584 --> 00:30:17,700
-Tower, this is Army 485. Over.
-485, go ahead.

342
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:20,774
This is a radio check.
Charlie, Uncle, Victor, Tango.

343
00:30:24,503 --> 00:30:26,891
As soon as you're ready, call in.

344
00:30:27,144 --> 00:30:28,496
Bombardier checking in.

345
00:30:29,264 --> 00:30:30,582
Navigator checking in.

346
00:30:30,904 --> 00:30:32,416
Top turret checking in.

347
00:30:33,024 --> 00:30:35,093
Radio operator checking in.

348
00:30:37,144 --> 00:30:38,576
Ball turret checking in.

349
00:30:38,663 --> 00:30:40,937
Right waist gunner checking in.

350
00:30:42,703 --> 00:30:44,374
Left waist gunner checking in.

351
00:30:46,664 --> 00:30:48,540
Tail gunner checking in.

352
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:52,418
-Intercoolers.
-Set.

353
00:30:52,504 --> 00:30:54,300
-Generators.
-Set.

354
00:30:54,584 --> 00:30:56,733
-Fuel boost pumps.
-Set.

355
00:30:58,864 --> 00:30:59,852
Good.

356
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:02,053
Crew, assume positions for takeoff.

357
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,861
There's a jeep coming.

358
00:31:07,544 --> 00:31:11,695
We got a delay. Cloud cover
over the target. It could blow over.

359
00:31:11,784 --> 00:31:13,296
Stand by 'til further notice.

360
00:31:13,384 --> 00:31:15,977
-For how long?
-They don't tell me doodly.

361
00:31:17,384 --> 00:31:19,214
Damn it! They always do this!

362
00:31:19,304 --> 00:31:21,373
We're delayed.
Cloud cover over the target.

363
00:31:21,464 --> 00:31:24,739
They want us to stand down
'til further notice. Tell the others.

364
00:31:24,864 --> 00:31:28,060
Fellows, the target's clouded over.
We're delayed.

365
00:31:28,784 --> 00:31:30,819
Son of a bitch!

366
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:32,212
Snafu.

367
00:31:32,304 --> 00:31:35,216
-Situation normal.
-All fucked up!

368
00:31:36,584 --> 00:31:38,255
Hear that, Clay?

369
00:31:38,384 --> 00:31:42,012
Okay, let's takes this extra time
to double double check everything.

370
00:31:42,185 --> 00:31:44,618
Let's make this our best mission yet.

371
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,535
-Brakes.
-Didn't you hear?

372
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:50,139
There's complete cloud cover over Bremen.
We're not going anywhere.

373
00:31:50,385 --> 00:31:51,578
Brakes.

374
00:31:53,984 --> 00:31:57,817
Set. They were set before
and they're still set.

375
00:31:58,024 --> 00:31:59,456
Intercoolers.

376
00:32:00,584 --> 00:32:01,379
Check!

377
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,221
-Converters.
-On.

378
00:32:04,985 --> 00:32:07,418
-Generators.
-Off.

379
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:10,819
-Fuel booster pumps.
-On.

380
00:32:11,825 --> 00:32:13,894
-Hydraulic pressure.
-Check.

381
00:32:14,145 --> 00:32:15,782
Fuel transfer valves.

382
00:32:16,585 --> 00:32:17,539
Off.

383
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:19,103
Oxygen supply.

384
00:32:23,945 --> 00:32:25,855
Say, Pop, is it busted?

385
00:32:26,665 --> 00:32:28,097
I don't know what's wrong.

386
00:32:28,185 --> 00:32:31,620
I got one like that at home.
Let me take a look at it.

387
00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:34,822
-You're just nervous.
-I'm not!

388
00:32:34,945 --> 00:32:37,857
It jammed on me last time.
I'm the one who has to sit in it!

389
00:32:37,944 --> 00:32:40,503
I checked it out. It's okay. Take it easy.

390
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:43,576
-Thanks, Virgin.
-The name's Virgil.

391
00:32:43,665 --> 00:32:45,063
Not to me.

392
00:32:45,185 --> 00:32:47,175
Rascal, I could tell you something.

393
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:49,539
What could you tell me, Virgin?

394
00:32:50,105 --> 00:32:51,253
Nothing.

395
00:32:57,745 --> 00:33:01,498
You just call me on the intercom
and say you got a little trouble on the tail.

396
00:33:01,585 --> 00:33:03,859
I come back, you give me the gun
for five minutes.

397
00:33:03,945 --> 00:33:05,263
It's against regulations.

398
00:33:05,345 --> 00:33:07,494
Screw the regulations.

399
00:33:07,665 --> 00:33:10,656
If they found out they'd put my hot dog
in a bun and chow down.

400
00:33:10,745 --> 00:33:12,814
No one will know! Just you and I.

401
00:33:12,905 --> 00:33:15,543
I want to get my hands
on that gun just once.

402
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:18,741
How will I get girls
if I haven't killed a single Nazi?

403
00:33:18,825 --> 00:33:21,497
Please. I'll do anything you say,
just name your price.

404
00:33:24,705 --> 00:33:26,456
-Anything?
-Anything.

405
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,742
Give me your dog.

406
00:33:39,986 --> 00:33:41,577
Seven to one we're not going.

407
00:33:41,665 --> 00:33:43,814
Let's just get it over with.

408
00:33:44,186 --> 00:33:47,177
I'd rather get it over going
to a nice little French target.

409
00:33:47,266 --> 00:33:50,257
If we bail out we can hide out
in a French girl's hayloft.

410
00:33:50,346 --> 00:33:51,778
Is that all you think about?

411
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:54,464
Yes, it is. I have to make up for you.

412
00:33:54,546 --> 00:33:57,298
-Grow up, Rascal.
-Shut up! You make me sick!

413
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:00,379
Both of you just shut up!

414
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:02,461
-All right. Calm down.
-Come on.

415
00:34:02,906 --> 00:34:05,738
Getting excited won't make this go faster.

416
00:34:06,306 --> 00:34:09,581
Just relax. Try to be
a little bit more like Phil.

417
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,620
What do we got here? Poetry.

418
00:34:16,746 --> 00:34:19,305
-We have a poet on board.
-May I have my book, please?

419
00:34:19,386 --> 00:34:21,216
Read us a poem, Danny.

420
00:34:24,746 --> 00:34:26,622
No, nothing's finished.

421
00:34:26,705 --> 00:34:28,535
I didn't know you wrote. Read something.

422
00:34:28,626 --> 00:34:30,695
I want to hear some poetry.

423
00:34:31,106 --> 00:34:34,097
-Don't be shy.
-Read something you've started.

424
00:34:34,946 --> 00:34:37,584
We got a regular Shakespeare on board.

425
00:34:39,785 --> 00:34:42,617
-You got a good tone, Jack.
-Tone deaf.

426
00:34:49,946 --> 00:34:53,415
''I know that I shall meet my fate
Somewhere among the clouds above''

427
00:34:53,547 --> 00:34:54,820
Oh, Lord.

428
00:34:57,346 --> 00:35:01,497
''Those that I fight I do not hate
Those that I guard I do not love

429
00:35:06,066 --> 00:35:08,374
''Nor law, nor duty bade me fight

430
00:35:10,026 --> 00:35:12,539
''Nor public men, nor cheering crowds

431
00:35:13,787 --> 00:35:15,936
''A lonely impulse of delight

432
00:35:16,467 --> 00:35:18,934
''Drove to this tumult in the clouds

433
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:27,182
''I balanced all, brought all to mind

434
00:35:28,747 --> 00:35:31,135
''The years to come
seemed waste of breath

435
00:35:32,227 --> 00:35:34,694
''A waste of breath the years behind

436
00:35:35,986 --> 00:35:39,500
''In balance with this life, this death''

437
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:50,774
Captain!

438
00:35:51,466 --> 00:35:55,378
You're going up! Start engines
in five minutes! Five minutes!

439
00:36:03,507 --> 00:36:04,859
Lieutenant.

440
00:36:05,587 --> 00:36:08,737
If you want to, you can come back
and fire my gun.

441
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:11,140
-I'm not giving you my dog.
-Lieutenant...

442
00:36:11,267 --> 00:36:14,258
...I don't want
that flea-bitten mangy old pooch.

443
00:36:16,146 --> 00:36:18,136
Wake up, Bill. Time to go to work!

444
00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:48,780
Here we go, boys.

445
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:12,943
Okay, Mona baby,
we're going to get us a nice 109 today.

446
00:41:13,029 --> 00:41:15,064
We did it before, we'll do it again.

447
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:18,380
Sweet-talking your gun won't help.
Just straight shooting.

448
00:41:18,549 --> 00:41:20,220
Hey, shut up, Gene.

449
00:41:20,709 --> 00:41:22,778
When I got my two Nazi fighters--

450
00:41:22,869 --> 00:41:24,301
Hey, shut up!

451
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,906
-Climb power.
-I know.

452
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,739
-Watch the cowl flaps.
-I know!

453
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:49,341
Look out! Oh, my God!

454
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:24,464
Luke, take over for a minute.

455
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:30,948
Hey, it's Baby Ruth.
Who's our right wingman?

456
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,861
Mother and Country.

457
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:35,458
Oh, swell. The rookie crew.

458
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,545
-Soup?
-No, thank you, sir.

459
00:42:44,871 --> 00:42:46,861
Captain, okay if I arm my bombs?

460
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:48,622
Yeah, go ahead.

461
00:42:49,711 --> 00:42:51,223
Val, take this.

462
00:42:51,351 --> 00:42:54,148
-You're not going to die.
-Just in case.

463
00:42:54,311 --> 00:42:57,461
You're flak-happy.
Just do your job and shut up!

464
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:14,223
Bombs armed.

465
00:43:14,311 --> 00:43:17,347
Rascal, there's nothing wrong
with the ball turret.

466
00:43:17,471 --> 00:43:19,188
Don't worry about it, Virge.

467
00:43:19,271 --> 00:43:20,908
I'm just doing my job.

468
00:43:20,991 --> 00:43:23,504
Now you do it. Thanks a lot, buddy.

469
00:43:24,471 --> 00:43:26,301
-Okay?
-Yes, thank you!

470
00:43:42,511 --> 00:43:45,070
We're at 10,000 feet.
Let's hear those oxygen checks.

471
00:43:46,032 --> 00:43:47,544
Clay, how you doing?

472
00:43:48,391 --> 00:43:50,426
Well, I'm just fine, Lieutenant.

473
00:44:02,111 --> 00:44:05,546
Captain, we're exactly five miles south
southwest of Yarmouth.

474
00:44:05,671 --> 00:44:08,343
We're in formation. This is the rally point.

475
00:44:10,592 --> 00:44:13,230
Okay, boys. We're on our way.

476
00:44:46,552 --> 00:44:48,906
Listen. I'm showing 30 below zero here.

477
00:44:49,192 --> 00:44:50,670
Let's be careful.

478
00:44:50,752 --> 00:44:54,141
Don't touch your guns with bare hands
or they'll freeze right to it.

479
00:44:54,272 --> 00:44:56,831
I don't want anyone losing any fingers.

480
00:44:56,912 --> 00:44:59,266
Check your masks for frozen saliva.

481
00:44:59,352 --> 00:45:03,902
The ice blocks your oxygen flow
and I don't want anyone passing out.

482
00:45:04,032 --> 00:45:05,783
In short, don't drool.

483
00:45:05,872 --> 00:45:08,066
In short, check your mask, Rascal.

484
00:45:08,512 --> 00:45:10,900
All right, let's keep the intercom free.

485
00:45:10,992 --> 00:45:15,223
Call out those fighters and don't shout.
We can hear you loud and clear.

486
00:45:15,592 --> 00:45:19,220
Let's make this our best run yet.
One we can really be proud of.

487
00:45:19,312 --> 00:45:20,869
Right in the pickle barrel.

488
00:45:20,992 --> 00:45:25,746
That's right. Keep your minds on your job,
work together, and stay alert.

489
00:45:27,592 --> 00:45:30,788
Captain, I'm getting A.F.N. here.
Can I put it on?

490
00:45:31,512 --> 00:45:32,739
Please, sir.

491
00:45:32,832 --> 00:45:35,709
All right, but when I say that's enough....

492
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:04,666
''I hear gypsy violins''

493
00:46:05,992 --> 00:46:07,663
Lord have mercy, Jack.

494
00:46:07,752 --> 00:46:11,346
''When you dance with me I'm in heaven''

495
00:46:13,152 --> 00:46:16,587
Heaven? Come to my bunk,
I'll give you heaven, honey.

496
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:33,908
Okay, let's test our guns.

497
00:46:50,512 --> 00:46:52,502
Little friends, three o'clock high.

498
00:47:00,833 --> 00:47:04,620
Oh, God. I'd give anything to fly a fighter.

499
00:47:06,233 --> 00:47:10,191
You're all alone. You can do anything
you want. That's flying.

500
00:47:10,313 --> 00:47:14,191
-It's the best pen money can buy.
-Why can't I have the baseball cards?

501
00:47:14,313 --> 00:47:16,507
They're for him. Here, Jack.

502
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:20,068
I'm more of a football fan myself.
You know the Bears?

503
00:47:22,754 --> 00:47:24,823
-Here! Happy?
-Yeah!

504
00:47:24,914 --> 00:47:26,983
-Thanks, Jack!
-Thanks, Genie!

505
00:47:29,953 --> 00:47:32,386
Mother and Country calling Memphis Belle.
Come in.

506
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:33,952
Read you. What's wrong?

507
00:47:34,033 --> 00:47:35,909
Nothing. I just had a question.

508
00:47:35,993 --> 00:47:38,631
We can only use the radio
in an emergency.

509
00:47:38,753 --> 00:47:40,902
Sorry. It was about my log book.

510
00:47:41,033 --> 00:47:44,422
Should I write down every radio
communication, or just some?

511
00:47:44,513 --> 00:47:47,709
Write everything. Later you'll figure out
what's important.

512
00:47:47,793 --> 00:47:51,023
-We better sign off.
-Thanks. I won't bother you again.

513
00:47:51,314 --> 00:47:53,986
Smile. I'm going to take your picture.

514
00:48:01,113 --> 00:48:02,784
Hope it comes out.

515
00:48:04,193 --> 00:48:07,662
We're getting close to enemy territory,
so be on guard.

516
00:48:07,954 --> 00:48:10,706
Call out the fighters when you see them.

517
00:48:10,953 --> 00:48:12,783
Clay, you sang great last night.

518
00:48:12,874 --> 00:48:17,664
You should go to Hollywood and get
a record contract like Frank Sinatra.

519
00:48:18,074 --> 00:48:20,667
Yeah, so we can say we knew you when.

520
00:48:21,594 --> 00:48:26,428
I want to get a farm, a wife, and settle
down. Luke should go to Hollywood.

521
00:48:26,514 --> 00:48:28,105
He could star in the movies.

522
00:48:29,354 --> 00:48:30,832
Maybe. Maybe.

523
00:48:31,954 --> 00:48:35,548
I don't know what I'll do after the war,
except not work.

524
00:48:35,794 --> 00:48:39,833
Yeah, why go back to the daily grind
of being a lifeguard? Take it easy.

525
00:48:40,434 --> 00:48:42,264
I know exactly what I'm going to do.

526
00:48:42,354 --> 00:48:45,345
Virge, one more word about
that stupid restaurant....

527
00:48:45,474 --> 00:48:50,183
It's not stupid! At least I've got a plan.
What'll you do after the war, Rascal?

528
00:48:50,354 --> 00:48:52,105
Rob your restaurant.

529
00:48:53,274 --> 00:48:56,265
Val's smart. He's almost a doctor.

530
00:48:56,354 --> 00:48:59,186
What kind of doctor you going to be, Val?

531
00:48:59,274 --> 00:49:00,626
A rich one.

532
00:49:01,074 --> 00:49:03,541
And Phil? What'll he be after the war?

533
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:05,670
I know. A mortician.

534
00:49:10,035 --> 00:49:14,186
Fellows, think about this.
My family has a furniture business.

535
00:49:14,554 --> 00:49:16,589
We make furniture then we sell it.

536
00:49:16,674 --> 00:49:18,868
You could all come to work for me.

537
00:49:25,115 --> 00:49:27,389
Like I said, don't give it a thought.

538
00:49:28,034 --> 00:49:31,548
Just what we need. Taking orders
from you for the rest of our lives.

539
00:49:31,714 --> 00:49:33,431
''Let's do the preflight check. ''

540
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:35,908
- ''Don't hog the intercom. ''
- ''Call out them fighters. ''

541
00:49:35,994 --> 00:49:38,951
- ''Check your masks. ''
- ''Let's make this our best run yet. ''

542
00:49:40,674 --> 00:49:42,470
I'm not that bad.

543
00:49:45,395 --> 00:49:48,511
Danny, you didn't say what you'll do
when it's all over.

544
00:49:48,674 --> 00:49:50,789
I don't even like to think about it.

545
00:49:50,875 --> 00:49:52,910
What if something happens?

546
00:49:54,635 --> 00:49:58,070
We could all be old men
by the time the war is over.

547
00:49:58,955 --> 00:50:00,990
It just seems so far away.

548
00:50:02,154 --> 00:50:03,871
I'm sorry, fellows.

549
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:06,151
Bandits, five o'clock!

550
00:50:14,275 --> 00:50:15,946
Go get them, little friends.

551
00:50:19,155 --> 00:50:23,227
Hold your fire 'til Jerry's in range.
Don't waste your ammunition.

552
00:50:36,475 --> 00:50:38,704
I said hold your fire!

553
00:50:38,795 --> 00:50:41,354
-That was Genie the weenie.
-Shut up, Jackass!

554
00:50:51,475 --> 00:50:53,146
-Six o'clock high.
-Nine o'clock high.

555
00:50:53,235 --> 00:50:55,031
Two 190s, twelve o'clock high.

556
00:50:56,195 --> 00:50:58,947
Three fighters, nine o'clock,
coming around.

557
00:50:59,035 --> 00:51:01,184
Top turret, eleven high. Can't reach them.

558
00:51:01,275 --> 00:51:02,832
Got them in my sight.

559
00:51:03,395 --> 00:51:05,589
Bogey, four high. Danny, see him?

560
00:51:05,755 --> 00:51:07,426
Two more, coming fast.

561
00:51:07,515 --> 00:51:09,425
M-109 going down at eleven.

562
00:51:17,276 --> 00:51:19,391
-Got one on my back.
-I'm on him.

563
00:51:26,475 --> 00:51:29,147
-Watch them, waist gunner.
-They're flying close today.

564
00:51:29,235 --> 00:51:31,828
Five o'clock high. Looks like a 190.

565
00:51:33,596 --> 00:51:38,032
-This guy at ten is smoking.
-The waist of Mother and Country got him.

566
00:51:38,115 --> 00:51:40,344
First time out he gets a kill.

567
00:51:41,195 --> 00:51:42,547
He's bailing out.

568
00:51:45,795 --> 00:51:49,025
Call out planes you see going down
so Danny can put them in his log.

569
00:51:49,276 --> 00:51:51,584
We've done this before, Captain.

570
00:51:52,436 --> 00:51:55,188
Fighters at nine, but they're staying away.

571
00:52:00,996 --> 00:52:01,950
Ten-thirty.

572
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:03,912
-Ten-thirty high or low?
-Low!

573
00:52:04,316 --> 00:52:07,068
-Here they come.
-We've got company at seven o'clock.

574
00:52:10,316 --> 00:52:12,033
109, three o'clock.

575
00:52:20,876 --> 00:52:22,433
109s at ten level.

576
00:52:22,596 --> 00:52:23,744
Come on.

577
00:52:23,916 --> 00:52:25,143
Come on.

578
00:52:26,036 --> 00:52:27,753
Come to Papa, you--

579
00:52:29,436 --> 00:52:32,233
I almost had him! Damn it! Wiener!

580
00:52:32,317 --> 00:52:34,830
He's coming again. Get the bastard!

581
00:52:39,116 --> 00:52:41,071
Two at six. They're coming in.

582
00:52:44,756 --> 00:52:46,791
They're going after the first flight.

583
00:52:55,117 --> 00:52:56,913
Windy City's on fire!

584
00:53:02,556 --> 00:53:05,023
-Why don't they do something?
-Bail out!

585
00:53:05,956 --> 00:53:09,231
-Come on, wake up! Get out!
-There's a hole in the pilot's window!

586
00:53:13,877 --> 00:53:15,389
Hold on!

587
00:53:16,717 --> 00:53:17,944
Call in!

588
00:53:18,317 --> 00:53:20,034
Ball turret. Get us out of here!

589
00:53:20,157 --> 00:53:21,794
-Right waist.
-Keep calling in.

590
00:53:21,876 --> 00:53:24,264
-Bombardier.
-Navigator, check in.

591
00:53:25,116 --> 00:53:26,833
-Navigator!
-Phil.

592
00:53:27,556 --> 00:53:31,343
-Here. Navigator checking in.
-When I say ''check in, '' I mean right away.

593
00:53:31,797 --> 00:53:33,866
Someone's guts are on the nose!

594
00:53:34,117 --> 00:53:36,755
Any damage? Crew, check your stations.

595
00:53:37,157 --> 00:53:38,794
-Nose okay.
-Tail okay.

596
00:53:38,876 --> 00:53:40,069
Radio room okay.

597
00:53:40,157 --> 00:53:42,431
Keep calling out those bandits.

598
00:53:53,717 --> 00:53:55,149
They're gone.

599
00:53:55,557 --> 00:53:57,592
Yep. Hit and run.

600
00:54:01,437 --> 00:54:04,314
I just heard from C Cup.
They're taking the lead.

601
00:54:04,437 --> 00:54:06,074
-Hear that, Val?
-Roger.

602
00:54:06,637 --> 00:54:10,424
C Cup's lead plane now.
When they drop their bombs, so do we.

603
00:54:10,517 --> 00:54:11,505
Got it.

604
00:54:15,157 --> 00:54:17,226
Any chutes from Windy City?

605
00:54:24,718 --> 00:54:27,550
They didn't even have time
to pee in their pants.

606
00:54:27,717 --> 00:54:29,752
Here one minute, gone the next.

607
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:31,065
That's the way to go.

608
00:54:31,157 --> 00:54:33,226
Do we have to talk about it?

609
00:54:34,038 --> 00:54:37,825
I heard a good one from their waist gunner.
What was his name?

610
00:54:37,957 --> 00:54:39,912
-Cooley.
-No, the left one.

611
00:54:39,997 --> 00:54:42,066
Am I talking to myself? Cooley!

612
00:54:42,197 --> 00:54:44,187
-I mean the right one.
-I know him.

613
00:54:44,317 --> 00:54:45,908
-Tall guy?
-Not so tall.

614
00:54:45,997 --> 00:54:47,554
Everyone's tall to me.

615
00:54:48,517 --> 00:54:50,586
-Lindquist.
-No, no.

616
00:54:50,957 --> 00:54:53,914
-Something like that.
-You're not even close.

617
00:54:54,398 --> 00:54:56,592
Anyway, a plane gets shot down.

618
00:54:56,717 --> 00:55:00,504
A guy bails out and is captured.
His leg is broken and they amputate.

619
00:55:00,598 --> 00:55:02,906
He says, ''After you cut it off...

620
00:55:02,998 --> 00:55:06,626
''...have a pilot drop it
over my base in England. '' They do it.

621
00:55:07,117 --> 00:55:08,515
Don't tie up the intercom.

622
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:10,427
This is a quick one.

623
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:12,713
The next week they cut off his other leg.

624
00:55:12,878 --> 00:55:16,392
He says again, ''Will you drop it
over my base?'' And they do it.

625
00:55:16,478 --> 00:55:18,945
The next week they cut off his arm.

626
00:55:19,198 --> 00:55:21,995
He asks again,
''Will you drop it over my base?''

627
00:55:22,078 --> 00:55:25,274
This time they say,
''Nein. This we can't do anymore. ''

628
00:55:25,398 --> 00:55:27,035
He says, ''Why not?''

629
00:55:27,118 --> 00:55:30,314
And they say,
''We think you are trying to escape. ''

630
00:55:34,438 --> 00:55:35,995
-Son of a gun.
-I don't get it.

631
00:55:36,438 --> 00:55:39,747
That was good, Rascal.
I think even Dennis liked it.

632
00:55:41,238 --> 00:55:43,671
Stoller! That's the guy's name. Stoller.

633
00:55:45,478 --> 00:55:47,149
Stoller wasn't on Windy City.

634
00:55:47,278 --> 00:55:49,745
-You sure?
-Wait. It'll come to me.

635
00:55:50,678 --> 00:55:53,271
Oh, yeah. I can see that guy's face.

636
00:55:54,998 --> 00:55:56,430
Yeah, me too.

637
00:55:59,918 --> 00:56:03,466
Well, whatever his name was,
it was a good joke.

638
00:56:05,918 --> 00:56:09,830
Let's stop fooling around.
Jerry's out there. Let's look sharp.

639
00:56:11,238 --> 00:56:14,070
Damn! Our little friends leaving already?

640
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,471
They know when to run out of fuel.

641
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:19,270
They ain't dumb.

642
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:28,108
My medal! Oh, my God!

643
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,074
My medal, have you seen it?

644
00:56:44,158 --> 00:56:45,556
Hey, Wiener!

645
00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:48,716
Thanks, buddy.

646
00:56:51,318 --> 00:56:54,309
-Why'd you do that?
-Now we're even!

647
00:56:56,158 --> 00:56:58,512
-Right waist, call in.
-I'm gonna kill you!

648
00:56:58,598 --> 00:57:01,157
Radio operator, see what's happening.

649
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:04,833
Don't ever touch me when I'm on my gun!

650
00:57:04,918 --> 00:57:07,385
-You hear me?
-Break it up!

651
00:57:07,478 --> 00:57:09,274
-Break it up!
-Get him back on his gun!

652
00:57:10,198 --> 00:57:13,075
-What happened?
-Jack threw my medal out the window!

653
00:57:13,438 --> 00:57:15,667
I'm finished, Danny, finished!

654
00:57:17,799 --> 00:57:19,629
No, you're not. Here.

655
00:57:19,999 --> 00:57:21,795
Take my lucky rubber band.

656
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:25,913
It works! I swear to God it works.
You'll be all right. Okay?

657
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:30,147
You'll be okay! I want it back.

658
00:57:34,439 --> 00:57:36,235
Navigator, give us the position.

659
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:41,513
That's the Third Reich down there.

660
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:44,547
Now the shit really hits the fan.

661
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,231
You better come take a look.

662
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:15,952
We got to liven up that whole area.

663
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:19,232
And make sure the banner is centered.

664
00:58:22,439 --> 00:58:24,508
What's the meaning of this?

665
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:28,506
Put the piano on the platform.
It's just a little party, Colonel.

666
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:31,590
I did not order this. I did not order this.

667
00:58:31,719 --> 00:58:34,232
Leave this to me.
The Memphis Belle's my job.

668
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:39,069
My job is to approve everything on
this base. I didn't approve a homecoming.

669
00:58:39,239 --> 00:58:42,116
You're working too hard
at being a hard-ass.

670
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,994
What's the harm in a party for these guys?
They're special.

671
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:49,754
I have 24 crews up there.
They are all special to me.

672
00:58:51,279 --> 00:58:54,270
Great story, but baloney's my business.
I know it when I see it.

673
00:58:54,359 --> 00:58:58,033
All you care about is getting planes
in the air. Results. Brown-nosing HQ.

674
00:58:58,279 --> 00:59:00,473
-The only man--
-Come with me.

675
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,434
You don't care if these men live or die.
It's just another airplane--

676
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:08,833
Sit down!

677
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,558
Start reading.

678
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,275
This is from a father whose son
had his head blown off over Lorient.

679
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,554
-You're cracking up.
-Read it!

680
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,589
''Dear Col. Harriman:
Thank you for the letter about my son.

681
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,670
''He must have made a big impression...

682
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,267
''...because you described him exactly.

683
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,788
''I wish you could have told me...

684
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:48,512
''...how Tommy died, but I guess
we must be careful about security.

685
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,548
''I'm glad he was brave to the end.

686
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:54,233
''Maybe we raised him right after all.

687
00:59:58,681 --> 01:00:01,194
''We'll get used to him being gone...

688
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,674
''...but not too soon, I hope.

689
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:06,109
''I can read your letter to bring him back. ''

690
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,396
''Dear sir, Your letter of December 10
finally made me realize...

691
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,874
''...my husband is gone.
I have been living...

692
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:15,429
''...in the false hopes
that the telegram was a mistake. ''

693
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,829
''Dear sir, I am writing on behalf
of my parents...

694
01:00:18,961 --> 01:00:20,598
''...who appreciated your letter...

695
01:00:20,681 --> 01:00:25,471
''...about my brother's death. We were
all glad to know that Frank didn't suffer...

696
01:00:25,561 --> 01:00:27,790
''...and was not alone when he died. ''

697
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:30,393
''I saw him off at the train station.

698
01:00:31,241 --> 01:00:34,676
''He was excited to be doing
something important with his life.

699
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:37,592
''He couldn't stop looking
at his shoulder stripes. ''

700
01:00:37,681 --> 01:00:40,069
''I hope when it's over
the world will have learned...

701
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,231
''...there's a better way
to solve its problems.

702
01:00:43,321 --> 01:00:45,709
''My prayers are
for my husband's comrades.

703
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:49,229
''May they fly safely and return home soon.

704
01:00:50,081 --> 01:00:52,071
''Best wishes, Mrs. Peterman. ''

705
01:01:16,521 --> 01:01:18,351
Bandits, five o'clock!

706
01:01:20,201 --> 01:01:21,997
Bogey, five o'clock low.

707
01:01:22,081 --> 01:01:23,672
Three o'clock high.

708
01:01:25,961 --> 01:01:28,474
I said don't yell on the intercom!

709
01:01:29,841 --> 01:01:32,718
Breaking low at five o'clock.
Ball turret, watch out.

710
01:01:32,801 --> 01:01:35,792
Fighter at ten coming in a half-roll.

711
01:01:39,642 --> 01:01:41,393
That guy had blue eyes!

712
01:01:45,241 --> 01:01:47,708
Tail gunner, one coming down from six.

713
01:01:47,801 --> 01:01:49,518
190, twelve o'clock high!

714
01:01:49,762 --> 01:01:51,558
He's going for C Cup.

715
01:01:57,042 --> 01:01:59,919
Oh, God. He doesn't have a parachute!

716
01:02:02,081 --> 01:02:04,275
Everyone make sure you have your chutes.

717
01:02:04,442 --> 01:02:05,556
Parachutes?

718
01:02:05,682 --> 01:02:07,637
There isn't even room to breathe here.

719
01:02:07,722 --> 01:02:09,439
Then put your safety strap on.

720
01:02:09,641 --> 01:02:11,278
-It hurts.
-Do it!

721
01:02:21,241 --> 01:02:22,912
I just heard from C Cup.

722
01:02:23,001 --> 01:02:26,151
They're leaving formation.
We're in the lead now.

723
01:02:27,041 --> 01:02:28,519
Bye-bye C Cup.

724
01:02:33,882 --> 01:02:35,519
The bogeyman's gonna get them.

725
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:39,759
Danny, get me C channel to talk to Group.

726
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,673
Those poor bastards.

727
01:02:46,762 --> 01:02:48,240
This is the Memphis Belle.

728
01:02:48,842 --> 01:02:50,354
We're lead plane now.

729
01:02:50,442 --> 01:02:54,275
I'll do my best to get the bombs right in
and get us out safe.

730
01:02:55,082 --> 01:02:59,473
I'll need all the help you can give,
so let's tighten up and be on our toes.

731
01:02:59,602 --> 01:03:03,389
We're three minutes and thirty seconds
from the bomb run.

732
01:03:18,482 --> 01:03:19,630
One o'clock!

733
01:03:19,882 --> 01:03:21,360
Ball turret, watch out.

734
01:03:27,362 --> 01:03:30,159
I'm jammed! He's coming at me!

735
01:03:30,242 --> 01:03:31,310
Help me!

736
01:03:31,402 --> 01:03:33,073
He's coming at me!

737
01:03:40,963 --> 01:03:42,315
And your mother, too!

738
01:03:44,402 --> 01:03:45,516
Damn!

739
01:03:54,803 --> 01:03:56,952
Jack's hit!

740
01:03:57,042 --> 01:03:58,759
Val, go take a look at Jack.

741
01:03:58,843 --> 01:04:00,878
I'm two minutes from the bomb run.

742
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,758
Gene, take care of it.

743
01:04:02,842 --> 01:04:05,116
Hold still! Let me look!

744
01:04:12,403 --> 01:04:14,074
What are you laughing about?

745
01:04:14,163 --> 01:04:16,039
It's a scratch! It's nothing!

746
01:04:16,123 --> 01:04:18,556
You're screaming like a stuck pig.

747
01:04:21,403 --> 01:04:23,632
They destroyed my favorite harmonica.

748
01:04:23,963 --> 01:04:26,476
Oh, you rotten sons of bitches!

749
01:04:28,723 --> 01:04:31,953
You son of a bitch.
You scared the shit out of me.

750
01:04:40,923 --> 01:04:42,594
How'd you do that?

751
01:04:44,243 --> 01:04:45,834
Magic.

752
01:04:46,843 --> 01:04:49,993
Flak! Twelve o'clock level. Here we go.

753
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:56,998
They got about 500 antiaircraft guns
around Bremen.

754
01:04:57,123 --> 01:04:59,556
I could live without knowing that.

755
01:04:59,723 --> 01:05:02,316
Clay, what are the odds
of us getting out alive?

756
01:05:03,163 --> 01:05:05,357
I was just figuring that out.

757
01:05:06,163 --> 01:05:07,277
Damn.

758
01:05:09,923 --> 01:05:11,355
What's wrong?

759
01:05:11,443 --> 01:05:14,400
A big piece of Nazi flak just hit my turret.

760
01:05:14,563 --> 01:05:16,598
-Are you okay?
-I guess.

761
01:05:16,764 --> 01:05:18,913
-You guess or you are?
-I am!

762
01:05:19,003 --> 01:05:22,517
All right. I hope everybody's wearing
their flak jackets.

763
01:05:30,963 --> 01:05:32,953
Mother and Country calling Memphis Belle.

764
01:05:33,123 --> 01:05:37,035
Danny, this flak is not like I expected.
Can't we fly above it?

765
01:05:37,203 --> 01:05:40,638
No, we got to fly straight through it
or we'll be off target.

766
01:05:40,884 --> 01:05:42,635
Its just four minutes.

767
01:05:42,924 --> 01:05:44,356
Yeah, just.

768
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:04,721
Bombardier, I'm turning on the autopilot.

769
01:06:05,324 --> 01:06:07,598
You're flying the plane from here to target.

770
01:06:08,404 --> 01:06:09,518
She's all yours.

771
01:06:09,604 --> 01:06:10,752
Roger.

772
01:06:17,964 --> 01:06:19,555
Hold her steady.

773
01:06:20,044 --> 01:06:22,637
I've never seen it this thick before.

774
01:06:24,724 --> 01:06:26,520
Luke's hit! Luke's hit!

775
01:06:26,644 --> 01:06:28,679
-Dennis is hit!
-It's not me!

776
01:06:29,004 --> 01:06:31,563
It's not me. It must be you.
I think he's in shock.

777
01:06:31,644 --> 01:06:33,156
No, you're in shock!

778
01:06:33,244 --> 01:06:35,234
Val, get up here, quick!

779
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:36,517
I'm on the bomb run.

780
01:06:36,604 --> 01:06:38,116
It's definitely not me!

781
01:06:38,204 --> 01:06:39,636
It's definitely not me!

782
01:06:39,724 --> 01:06:41,793
There's someone's blood
all over the cockpit!

783
01:06:41,884 --> 01:06:44,033
Captain, it's tomato soup.

784
01:06:51,484 --> 01:06:52,598
What was that?

785
01:06:54,684 --> 01:06:57,561
There's a hole as big as my dick
in the left wing.

786
01:06:58,245 --> 01:06:59,916
We're losing fuel!

787
01:07:00,925 --> 01:07:02,880
Virge, get on the fuel transfer pump!

788
01:07:07,324 --> 01:07:10,838
The electrics must be out on the left side!
I'll do it by hand!

789
01:07:10,925 --> 01:07:14,200
Luke, get back there!
Save as much fuel as we can!

790
01:07:14,285 --> 01:07:15,876
Two minutes to target.

791
01:07:24,764 --> 01:07:26,515
Bomb bay doors open.

792
01:07:49,085 --> 01:07:52,315
Bombardier to pilot. Target is covered.
Looks like a smoke screen.

793
01:07:52,405 --> 01:07:55,202
Fuel transfer complete. We saved a little.

794
01:07:56,525 --> 01:07:58,480
How does that target look?

795
01:07:59,245 --> 01:08:01,200
Target totally obscured.

796
01:08:03,325 --> 01:08:05,121
Thirty seconds to target.

797
01:08:27,405 --> 01:08:31,113
Val, I need those bombs on target.
The whole group is bombing with us.

798
01:08:31,205 --> 01:08:33,354
If I can't see, I can't see!

799
01:08:40,045 --> 01:08:41,443
What are you doing?

800
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:46,193
We're going to bomb the factory,
even if it means going around again.

801
01:08:46,285 --> 01:08:50,277
That's suicide! It's asking the Nazis
to blow us out of the sky!

802
01:08:50,405 --> 01:08:51,917
I'm in command!

803
01:08:54,125 --> 01:08:55,557
Captain, what do I do?

804
01:09:09,565 --> 01:09:11,282
Bombardier, report.

805
01:09:11,806 --> 01:09:13,397
Visibility zero.

806
01:09:15,486 --> 01:09:17,282
If you do, we're dead!

807
01:09:21,126 --> 01:09:22,274
We're going again.

808
01:09:23,166 --> 01:09:25,633
Danny, get me C Channel to talk to Group.

809
01:09:33,126 --> 01:09:34,353
Get off!

810
01:09:36,606 --> 01:09:38,835
-Just drop them, Val.
-Shut up!

811
01:09:40,566 --> 01:09:41,714
Please.

812
01:09:46,486 --> 01:09:49,204
It'll be five minutes to get to the start
of the bomb run.

813
01:09:49,286 --> 01:09:51,196
Navigator, give me a position.

814
01:09:52,486 --> 01:09:54,476
Navigator! Did you hear me?

815
01:09:54,566 --> 01:09:55,839
Yes, sir.

816
01:10:00,606 --> 01:10:01,799
Everybody listen.

817
01:10:02,206 --> 01:10:05,277
I know you want to drop the bombs
and get out.

818
01:10:05,406 --> 01:10:08,318
But there's civilians down there. A school.

819
01:10:08,406 --> 01:10:11,681
If we don't drop the bombs on target,
innocent people will be killed.

820
01:10:11,767 --> 01:10:13,563
So what? They're all Nazis!

821
01:10:13,686 --> 01:10:14,913
Shut up!

822
01:10:17,406 --> 01:10:21,318
I don't want to do this any more than you.
We were sent to bomb a factory.

823
01:10:22,406 --> 01:10:26,523
If we don't do it, someone will have
to come back and do it for us.

824
01:10:27,246 --> 01:10:32,877
Nobody said this would be fun and games.
It's our job. Ours. Nobody else's.

825
01:10:34,086 --> 01:10:35,518
If we do this right...

826
01:10:35,767 --> 01:10:38,155
...we can always be proud of it.

827
01:10:38,366 --> 01:10:41,163
That's all I want, fellows. Believe me.

828
01:10:43,126 --> 01:10:46,800
Let's get back to work.
Call out those fighters.

829
01:11:01,886 --> 01:11:03,523
Bandits, three o'clock high!

830
01:11:03,606 --> 01:11:04,958
I see them.

831
01:11:20,407 --> 01:11:21,395
At eleven.

832
01:11:21,487 --> 01:11:23,238
They'll be all over us in a second.

833
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:30,960
Scattered at four, lining up to come in.

834
01:11:34,247 --> 01:11:37,204
Bandit, 12 o'clock high.
Look out, Cockpit, he's heading for you.

835
01:11:37,287 --> 01:11:38,719
What, should I spit on him?

836
01:11:44,807 --> 01:11:46,319
Tail gunner, how you doing?

837
01:11:46,407 --> 01:11:48,078
Just peachy, Lieutenant.

838
01:11:49,447 --> 01:11:52,279
Well, if you need any help, let me know.

839
01:11:52,367 --> 01:11:55,324
I sure will, but I think I'm fine right now.

840
01:11:55,408 --> 01:11:58,717
Lieutenant, actually,
I do need some help back here.

841
01:11:59,048 --> 01:12:01,515
-Tail gunner, what's wrong?
-I'm running out of ammo.

842
01:12:01,608 --> 01:12:03,006
I'll take care of it.

843
01:12:04,087 --> 01:12:06,805
Why can't someone else?
Left waist, right waist?

844
01:12:06,887 --> 01:12:09,719
We got fighters all over us back here.

845
01:12:09,927 --> 01:12:12,156
I'm the only one not doing anything.

846
01:12:14,808 --> 01:12:16,081
Make it fast.

847
01:12:16,168 --> 01:12:18,727
Watch that fighter at ten
coming in a half roll.

848
01:12:20,368 --> 01:12:22,676
Jerry, five high. Gene, watch yourself.

849
01:12:22,887 --> 01:12:25,446
Breaking under. Watch him, ball turret.

850
01:12:25,527 --> 01:12:27,562
Read you, Bombardier.

851
01:12:35,488 --> 01:12:37,079
Watch it.

852
01:12:39,648 --> 01:12:43,196
I owe you one, brother.
Nice view you got here.

853
01:12:48,008 --> 01:12:50,840
Tail gunner, see that bandit at seven low?
He's all yours.

854
01:12:51,208 --> 01:12:52,765
Two bogies at four high.

855
01:12:52,848 --> 01:12:54,917
Messerschmitts coming fast.

856
01:12:55,648 --> 01:12:57,797
Ball turret, 109s about seven low.

857
01:12:57,888 --> 01:12:59,036
I'm on him.

858
01:12:59,127 --> 01:13:01,003
Two at three high. Keep you eyes open.

859
01:13:01,088 --> 01:13:04,124
Seven level, coming like a son of a bitch!

860
01:13:04,408 --> 01:13:05,726
I got him!

861
01:13:13,888 --> 01:13:16,640
It's the rookies. They got the rookies.

862
01:13:20,008 --> 01:13:22,077
Memphis Belle calling Mother and Country.

863
01:13:22,768 --> 01:13:24,405
Mother and Country, come in!

864
01:13:24,528 --> 01:13:26,802
Oh, my God! Help us!

865
01:13:26,888 --> 01:13:28,923
Oh, God! No!

866
01:14:08,729 --> 01:14:10,525
How many chutes
from Mother and Country?

867
01:14:10,609 --> 01:14:12,838
-I saw two.
-Yeah, two.

868
01:14:24,209 --> 01:14:25,926
Captain, this is the bomb run.

869
01:14:26,008 --> 01:14:28,885
-Bombardier, I'm turning it over to you.
-Roger.

870
01:14:28,969 --> 01:14:30,321
It's all yours, Val.

871
01:14:34,889 --> 01:14:40,121
Luke, after delivery I'll try some
evasive action to avoid this flak.

872
01:14:40,249 --> 01:14:41,522
Be ready on runner.

873
01:14:41,609 --> 01:14:44,521
Whatever you say.
You know what you're doing.

874
01:14:56,248 --> 01:14:58,761
Bombardier, how does that target look?

875
01:15:00,009 --> 01:15:01,202
Like shit.

876
01:15:23,249 --> 01:15:25,284
Captain, I still can't see a thing.

877
01:15:41,089 --> 01:15:42,999
Oh, Lord. Come on.

878
01:15:48,769 --> 01:15:50,759
Bombardier, how does that target look?

879
01:15:51,489 --> 01:15:53,797
Target's still covered, Captain.

880
01:15:55,489 --> 01:15:57,126
What should I do?

881
01:16:01,969 --> 01:16:03,924
Captain, do you read me?

882
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:07,681
Yes, I read you.

883
01:16:12,690 --> 01:16:17,160
My sight says I'm over the target.
What do you want me to do?

884
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:31,168
That's it.

885
01:16:32,570 --> 01:16:33,888
That's it.

886
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:35,960
That's it! Bombs away!

887
01:17:16,650 --> 01:17:19,607
Okay, boys, we've done our job
for Uncle Sam.

888
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:22,160
Now we're flying for ourselves.

889
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:39,887
Bomb doors closing.

890
01:17:49,850 --> 01:17:51,521
Jerry, breaking low to nine o'clock.

891
01:17:51,611 --> 01:17:53,919
Ball turret, watch it! Watch it!

892
01:17:55,011 --> 01:17:58,002
I'm jammed. I'm stuck.
Shit, I'm stuck again!

893
01:17:58,730 --> 01:18:00,685
Virge, get me out of here!

894
01:18:00,811 --> 01:18:02,766
He's coming right at me!
I'm jammed again!

895
01:18:03,570 --> 01:18:05,127
Virge, help!

896
01:18:19,251 --> 01:18:23,004
Grab hold of me! Undo your safety strap!
Hold on.

897
01:18:24,971 --> 01:18:26,562
Come on up here!

898
01:18:27,251 --> 01:18:28,365
Grab onto me!

899
01:18:28,451 --> 01:18:32,682
I got you, Rascal, I got you!
Grab hold of me! Come on!

900
01:18:33,171 --> 01:18:34,762
Come on!

901
01:18:36,971 --> 01:18:39,165
You're okay. You're safe.

902
01:18:39,451 --> 01:18:44,729
You're all right. You're going to be okay.
Listen, you're all right. You're okay.

903
01:18:45,171 --> 01:18:46,762
Come here. You're okay.

904
01:18:47,371 --> 01:18:49,645
You're okay. You're going home.

905
01:19:00,771 --> 01:19:03,204
-Now what?
-Call in!

906
01:19:03,291 --> 01:19:04,609
Call in now!

907
01:19:04,691 --> 01:19:06,043
Fire extinguisher!

908
01:19:06,571 --> 01:19:08,481
I'll take care of Danny!

909
01:19:17,892 --> 01:19:19,643
Rascal, watch Danny!

910
01:19:25,451 --> 01:19:26,883
Danny's hurt.

911
01:19:27,291 --> 01:19:30,441
Val, Danny's hurt.
Go see what you can do.

912
01:19:30,532 --> 01:19:33,648
-How bad is it?
-I guess it's pretty bad, Val.

913
01:19:34,732 --> 01:19:37,848
-What are you doing? It's Danny!
-I can't. There's fighters--

914
01:19:37,931 --> 01:19:39,283
I'll cover your gun. Go!

915
01:19:39,371 --> 01:19:42,328
-Maybe somebody in the back--
-You're the doctor!

916
01:19:42,491 --> 01:19:45,209
That's just it. I'm not, Phil. I lied.

917
01:19:45,772 --> 01:19:49,525
I only had two weeks of medical school.
I don't know anything!

918
01:19:51,692 --> 01:19:53,124
Just do it!

919
01:20:36,972 --> 01:20:39,405
Somebody just shot a big chunk
off the tail.

920
01:20:43,052 --> 01:20:44,803
There's a fire in number four!

921
01:20:44,932 --> 01:20:48,685
Cut fuel! Feather prop!
Fire extinguishers! Generator off!

922
01:20:50,292 --> 01:20:53,044
-Call out those fighters!
-Danny's in bad shape.

923
01:20:53,172 --> 01:20:54,524
-How's Rascal?
-Okay.

924
01:20:54,612 --> 01:20:58,809
The extinguisher's not working. We got
to do something or we'll lose that wing.

925
01:20:58,892 --> 01:21:00,847
We got to dive.

926
01:21:01,812 --> 01:21:04,962
-I'll need your help to pull out of it.
-I'm not going anywhere.

927
01:21:05,212 --> 01:21:06,690
Memphis Belle to Group.

928
01:21:06,773 --> 01:21:09,844
We're diving to put out a fire.
Wingman, you're lead plane.

929
01:21:09,932 --> 01:21:11,649
Everybody, hang on.

930
01:21:54,452 --> 01:21:55,770
275!

931
01:21:55,853 --> 01:21:57,604
We're exceeding maximum dive speed.

932
01:21:57,692 --> 01:22:00,808
-We got to level out.
-The fire's not out. Just a little more.

933
01:22:00,893 --> 01:22:02,689
A little more and we'll lose the wing.

934
01:22:02,773 --> 01:22:05,240
Trust me. Just a few seconds more.

935
01:22:15,533 --> 01:22:16,521
It's out!

936
01:22:32,773 --> 01:22:33,761
Come on!

937
01:22:56,094 --> 01:22:59,403
Crew, we're at 10,000 feet.
You can come off oxygen.

938
01:23:07,294 --> 01:23:08,726
Thanks, Luke.

939
01:23:09,613 --> 01:23:12,206
Once in a while I do something right.

940
01:23:15,293 --> 01:23:17,681
I don't know what to do.
He's lost a lot of blood.

941
01:23:17,774 --> 01:23:19,172
How far is it to base?

942
01:23:19,254 --> 01:23:21,483
On three engines,
two or two-and-a-half hours.

943
01:23:21,574 --> 01:23:23,962
Two-and-a-half hours? He'll never make it.

944
01:23:24,053 --> 01:23:26,168
-Val, help him!
-What do you want from me?

945
01:23:26,254 --> 01:23:29,529
He needs a hospital.
All I have is a first-aid kit.

946
01:23:37,334 --> 01:23:39,051
Here you go, Danny.

947
01:23:40,534 --> 01:23:42,603
Okay, there's one more thing we can do.

948
01:23:42,734 --> 01:23:43,927
What? Let's do it.

949
01:23:44,013 --> 01:23:45,889
Put a parachute on him and push him out.

950
01:23:45,974 --> 01:23:48,248
-Jesus!
-It's crawling with Germans down there.

951
01:23:48,333 --> 01:23:51,449
-They'll take him to a hospital.
-If they don't kill him for fun.

952
01:23:51,534 --> 01:23:55,003
It's his only chance! Another crew did it.

953
01:23:55,094 --> 01:23:57,527
-He was conscious.
-Danny can't pull the cord.

954
01:23:57,614 --> 01:23:59,012
We can pull it first.

955
01:23:59,094 --> 01:24:01,402
-He could fall in a lake and drown.
-Can't we wait?

956
01:24:01,494 --> 01:24:04,451
We'll be over the North Sea in 10 minutes.
It'll be too late.

957
01:24:04,534 --> 01:24:07,127
We're going to do it, we have to do it now.

958
01:24:11,694 --> 01:24:13,649
-Watch his back.
-Keep his head up.

959
01:24:13,734 --> 01:24:15,689
-Don't push!
-Be careful.

960
01:24:17,974 --> 01:24:21,443
I'll go along with anything you say.
You're the doctor.

961
01:24:21,694 --> 01:24:25,288
-We just don't have a choice.
-Tell the men that's my decision.

962
01:24:25,734 --> 01:24:28,122
Phil! I don't want any argument.

963
01:24:30,974 --> 01:24:32,850
-Please don't do it.
-It's his only chance.

964
01:24:32,934 --> 01:24:35,891
No, you're his only chance,
but you're too chicken to help him!

965
01:24:35,974 --> 01:24:39,648
-If he stays on board, he'll die.
-If you throw him out he'll die.

966
01:24:48,095 --> 01:24:49,573
You can save him!

967
01:24:49,695 --> 01:24:53,972
So what if you're not a doctor yet?
You can help him. I know you can.

968
01:24:54,054 --> 01:24:56,442
He needs you! He's going to die!

969
01:24:56,894 --> 01:25:00,727
Don't do this. You'll always regret it.
I know you're scared.

970
01:25:01,695 --> 01:25:04,527
We're all scared! Now go help Danny.

971
01:25:06,855 --> 01:25:09,288
Let's go! All right. Hold his head.

972
01:25:21,255 --> 01:25:22,733
Come on, baby.

973
01:25:26,574 --> 01:25:28,086
There they are!

974
01:25:49,815 --> 01:25:51,213
-Seven!
-Eight!

975
01:25:51,295 --> 01:25:53,888
-No, nine!
-Did you get the one over there?

976
01:25:58,855 --> 01:26:01,209
-How many so far?
-Nine.

977
01:26:02,335 --> 01:26:03,926
There's another one.

978
01:26:04,015 --> 01:26:05,333
The Belle?

979
01:26:06,455 --> 01:26:08,092
No, sir, not yet.

980
01:26:13,615 --> 01:26:15,570
Feather prop. Cut fuel.

981
01:26:17,495 --> 01:26:20,008
Listen, we're flying on two engines now.

982
01:26:20,256 --> 01:26:25,090
Let's lighten up. Throw out everything.
We're close to home, so lose your guns.

983
01:26:25,575 --> 01:26:28,134
We never did get that fighter, did we?

984
01:26:28,616 --> 01:26:30,970
Oh, shit on a stick! Fuck!

985
01:26:32,455 --> 01:26:36,494
Lord have mercy.
You can have my bullets, too.

986
01:26:46,296 --> 01:26:48,047
Ain't that a pretty sight?

987
01:27:07,616 --> 01:27:10,812
''I balanced all, brought all to mind

988
01:27:12,696 --> 01:27:15,084
''The years to come
seemed waste of breath

989
01:27:16,056 --> 01:27:18,523
''A waste of breath the years behind

990
01:27:19,416 --> 01:27:22,452
''In balance with this life, this death''

991
01:27:23,536 --> 01:27:24,684
Yeats.

992
01:27:25,616 --> 01:27:27,207
It's okay, Danny.

993
01:27:28,136 --> 01:27:30,888
I didn't write that. It was W.B. Yeats.

994
01:27:34,256 --> 01:27:35,688
Take it easy.

995
01:27:40,656 --> 01:27:42,725
Don't do this to me, Danny!

996
01:27:45,896 --> 01:27:47,123
Damn it!

997
01:27:51,856 --> 01:27:53,573
One more like that.

998
01:28:01,016 --> 01:28:03,609
You try that again and I'll kill you.

999
01:28:30,857 --> 01:28:31,971
Landing gear.

1000
01:28:41,097 --> 01:28:42,529
Something's wrong.

1001
01:28:42,617 --> 01:28:44,652
Something is wrong.
My wheel didn't come down.

1002
01:28:44,737 --> 01:28:47,170
Fine. Take it back up. We'll belly land.

1003
01:28:48,937 --> 01:28:50,528
Nothing's coming up or going down.

1004
01:28:50,616 --> 01:28:52,731
The electrics must be totally out.

1005
01:28:54,536 --> 01:28:58,244
Virge, lower the wheel by hand.
Luke, tell me when it's down.

1006
01:28:58,337 --> 01:29:00,725
Crew, take positions for crash landing.

1007
01:29:00,817 --> 01:29:03,455
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

1008
01:29:03,937 --> 01:29:05,733
Come on, Jack, you got to help me.

1009
01:29:19,857 --> 01:29:22,165
-We're losing number three.
-Are we out of fuel?

1010
01:29:22,257 --> 01:29:24,724
Fuel gauge is out.
How long can we fly on one engine?

1011
01:29:24,817 --> 01:29:27,455
I don't know. I guess we'll find out.

1012
01:30:16,737 --> 01:30:18,772
Get out of the way, Virge!

1013
01:30:37,377 --> 01:30:39,412
Come on! Faster! Faster!

1014
01:30:43,138 --> 01:30:45,446
Come on! I got it! I got it!

1015
01:31:12,258 --> 01:31:13,531
Hurry up!

1016
01:31:14,698 --> 01:31:16,767
We're not going to die!

1017
01:31:22,378 --> 01:31:25,096
Oh, my God!
It's only got one wheel down.

1018
01:31:57,778 --> 01:31:58,926
Flaps!

1019
01:31:59,538 --> 01:32:01,812
We're not going to die!

1020
01:32:06,659 --> 01:32:07,807
We'll live!

1021
01:33:06,939 --> 01:33:08,166
We made it!

1022
01:33:08,299 --> 01:33:09,811
We made it, Genie the weenie!

1023
01:33:09,899 --> 01:33:11,729
We're home, Danny boy.

1024
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:09,292
I love you!

1025
01:34:21,619 --> 01:34:23,051
Welcome back.

1026
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:24,977
Terra firma, huh?

1027
01:34:25,220 --> 01:34:27,130
Can we clear this area?

1028
01:34:32,419 --> 01:34:34,249
Can we have the officers in front?

1029
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:36,330
Luke, come around to the front.

1030
01:34:39,380 --> 01:34:41,290
Officers in the center.

1031
01:34:41,780 --> 01:34:43,974
Just take the picture, Bruce.

1032
01:34:45,501 --> 01:34:47,331
What's wrong, Captain?
