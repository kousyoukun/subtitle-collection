1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,038
Drake, come on!

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,956
Aagh!

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,710
- Aaaghhh!
- No!

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,432
Fire in the hold!

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,273
- He's gone!
- No! Drake's out there!

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,873
Put it out!

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,791
Drake's coming!

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,313
He's gone!

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,879
No, he's... not!

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,117
Forget him! He's gone!

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,711
Get on the goddamn door!

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,795
Eat this!

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,396
Aagh!

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,793
Ripley! Go, go, go!

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,156
Whoa!

16
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,036
Oh!

17
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,794
It's all right! We're clear!

18
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,316
Ripley, you've blown the transaxle!
You're just grinding metal!

19
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,992
Come on, ease down.

20
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,875
Ease down.

21
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,038
Ease down!

22
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,115
Ease down.

23
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,510
You OK?

24
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,751
I'm all right.

25
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,911
Get away from me, man!

26
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,398
- Lieutenant.
- What happened to Gorman?

27
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,392
I don't know... Maybe a concussion.

28
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,189
- But he's alive.
- No, man, he's dead!

29
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,875
- Wake up, <i>pendejo!</i> I'm gonna kill you!
- Back off!

30
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,791
Right now.

31
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,030
Somebody get me a first-aid kit.

32
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,315
Hey. Hey, look!

33
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,198
The Sarge and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
Their signs are real low, but they ain't dead.

34
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,795
- Then we go back in there and get them.
- I ain't going back!

35
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,757
You can't help them!

36
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,831
You can't. Right now they're
being cocooned just like the others.

37
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,710
Oh, dear Lord Jesus,
this ain't happenin', man.

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,076
This can't be happenin', man.
This isn't happenin'!

39
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,477
We've got seven canisters of CN-20.

40
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,075
I say we roll them in there
and nerve-gas the whole fuckin' nest.

41
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,152
It's worth a try, but we
don't know if it'll affect 'em.

42
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,074
Let's bug out and call it even.
Why even talk about it?

43
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,596
I say we take off and
nuke the entire site from orbit.

44
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,191
It's the only way to be sure.

45
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,397
- Fuckin' A!
- Hold on one second.

46
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,473
This installation has a substantial
dollar value attached to it.

47
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,879
They can <i>bill</i> me.

48
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,629
OK, look.

49
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,838
This is an emotional moment
for all of us, OK? I know that.

50
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,559
But let's not make snap judgments, please.

51
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,757
This is clearly an important species
we're dealing with...

52
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,116
...and I don't think anybody
has the right to arbitrarily...

53
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,918
...exterminate them.
- Wrong.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,479
Yeah. Watch us.

55
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,395
Maybe you aren't up on current events,
but we just got our asses kicked, pal!

56
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,234
Look, I'm not blind to what's going on...

57
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,392
...but I cannot authorize that kind of action.

58
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,191
Well, I believe Corporal Hicks
has authority here.

59
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,471
Corporal Hicks is...

60
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,757
This operation is under military jurisdiction.

61
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,389
Hicks is next in chain of command.
Am I right, Corporal?

62
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,277
Yeah.

63
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,390
Yeah, that's right.

64
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,270
Yeah. Look, Ripley, this is
a multimillion-dollar installation, OK?

65
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,272
He can't make that decision. He's just a grunt.

66
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,349
No offence.

67
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,112
None taken.

68
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,515
- Ferro, do you copy?
<i>- Standing by.</i>

69
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,388
- Prep for dust-off. We need immediate evac.
<i>- Roger. On our way.</i>

70
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,150
I say we take off... nuke the site from orbit.
It's the only way to be sure.

71
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,352
Let's do it.

72
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,069
Let's go! Pick it up, Hudson.
Pick it up, baby.

73
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,916
All right. Set him down here.

74
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,911
Move it, Spunkmeyer. We're rolling.

75
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,074
Hold on a second. There's something...

76
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,151
<i>Just get up here.</i>

77
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,476
I'm in. Ramp closing.

78
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,119
Spunkmeyer.

79
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,629
Goddamn it.

80
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,277
Well, where the fuck...

81
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,117
Run!

82
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,276
Well, that's great.
That's just fuckin' great, man.

83
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,110
Now what the fuck are we supposed to do?
We're in some real pretty shit now, man!

84
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,270
Are you finished?

85
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,957
You all right?

86
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,435
I guess we're not
gonna be leaving now, right?

87
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,711
I'm sorry, Newt.

88
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,473
You don't have to be sorry.
It wasn't your fault.

89
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,836
That's it, man. Game over, man! Game over!

90
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,639
What the fuck are we gonna do now?
What are we gonna do?!

91
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,633
Maybe we could build a fire, sing
a couple of songs. Why don't we try that?

92
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,191
We'd better get back cos it'll be dark soon,
and they mostly come at night.

93
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,998
Mostly.

94
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,631
That's everything, right?

95
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,510
This is absolutely everything
we could salvage out of the APC wreckage.

96
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,797
We got four pulse rifles
with about 50 rounds each.

97
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,871
That ain't so good.

98
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,756
We got 15 of these M-40 grenades.

99
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,831
Don't touch that.

100
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,433
Dangerous, honey.

101
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,230
- Is that the only flamethrower?
- Yeah. It's only half full, but it's functional.

102
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,949
And another one's damaged.
I don't know about that one.

103
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,988
But the good news...

104
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,558
We got four of these robot sentries...

105
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,552
...with display and scanners intact.

106
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,234
They really kick ass. They'll come in handy.

107
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,108
How long after we're declared overdue
can we expect a rescue?

108
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,032
17 days.

109
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,791
17 days?

110
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,192
Hey, man, I don't wanna rain on your parade,
but we're not gonna last 17 hours!

111
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,795
Those things are gonna come in here
like they did before, and...

112
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,996
Hudson! Hudson!

113
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,789
This little girl survived longer than that
with no weapons and no training.

114
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,869
Right?

115
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,834
- Why don't you put <i>her</i> in charge?
- You better start dealing with it, Hudson.

116
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,629
Listen to me.
Deal with it, because we need you...

117
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,711
...and I'm sick of your bullshit.

118
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,032
Now get on a terminal and call up
a floor-plan file. Do you understand?

119
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,113
Construction blueprints. Anything that
shows the layout. Are you listening?

120
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,713
Yeah.

121
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,471
I need to see air ducts, electrical
access tunnels, sub-basements...

122
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,199
...every possible way into this complex.

123
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,952
We don't have much time.

124
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,632
OK.

125
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,791
- OK, I'm on it.
- Hudson...

126
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,552
Just relax.

127
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,077
I'll be in med lab.

128
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,470
I'll check on Gorman, continue my analysis.

129
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,470
Fine.

130
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,479
You do that.

131
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,995
So this service tunnel must be
how they're moving back and forth.

132
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,392
Right. It moves from the processing
station right into the sub-level here.

133
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,911
Come down on that.

134
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,797
OK, come over.

135
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,272
Hold it. Go back.
OK, punch that in right there.

136
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,550
- No. It's back here.
- OK.

137
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,560
Well, there's a pressure door at this end.

138
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,110
Couldn't we put a remote
sentry unit in the tunnel...

139
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,034
...and then seal that door?
- But we gotta figure on them getting in.

140
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,156
That's right, so...

141
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,789
...we repair the barricades
at these two intersections...

142
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,192
...and weld plate steel
over these ducts here, and here...

143
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,474
...and here.

144
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,992
Then they can only come at us
from these two corridors.

145
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,709
Right. Then we put
the other sentry units here...

146
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,392
...and here. Right?

147
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,471
- Right.
- Outstanding.

148
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,835
Now all we need is a deck of cards.

149
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,034
All right, let's move
like we've got a purpose.

150
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,759
- Affirmative.
- Affirmative.

151
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,118
Do your thing, baby.

152
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,509
Vasquez, let's get the hell out of here.

153
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,910
- A and B sentries are in place and keyed.
<i>- Roger.</i>

154
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,036
Stand by. Arming now.

155
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,519
Test it, Hudson.

156
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,909
- Do it!
- Fire in the hole!

157
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,913
OK! Let's get the hell out of here!

158
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,991
We're sealing the tunnel!

159
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,069
Come on, baby.

160
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,751
For what it's worth...

161
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,675
Here, I want you to put this on.

162
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,876
What's it for?

163
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,590
It's a locator. Then I can find you
anywhere in the complex... on this.

164
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,271
It's just a precaution.

165
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,999
Thanks.

166
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,994
Doesn't mean we're engaged or anything.

167
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,991
All right, what's next?

168
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,799
Last stop.

169
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,799
Get in.

170
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,428
Scoot down.

171
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,034
That's good.

172
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,429
Now you lie here and have a nap.

173
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,999
You're very tired.

174
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,311
I don't want to. I have scary dreams.

175
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,353
Well, I bet Casey doesn't have scary dreams.

176
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,153
Let's take a look.

177
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,796
Nope. Nothing bad in there.

178
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,029
See?

179
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,595
Maybe you could just try to be like her.

180
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,754
Ripley, she doesn't have bad dreams...

181
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,479
...because she's just a piece of plastic.

182
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,834
Right.

183
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,992
I'm sorry, Newt.

184
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,429
There.

185
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,599
My mommy always said there
were no monsters. No real ones.

186
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,636
But there are.

187
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,757
Yes, there are, aren't there?

188
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,079
Why do they tell little kids that?

189
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,671
Most of the time it's true.

190
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,070
Did one of those things grow inside her?

191
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,628
I don't know, Newt.

192
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,790
That's the truth.

193
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,269
Isn't that how babies come?

194
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,351
I mean, people babies?

195
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,989
- They grow inside you.
- No. That's very different.

196
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,957
Did you ever have a baby?

197
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,473
Yes, I did.

198
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,993
I had a little girl.

199
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,957
Where is she?

200
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,473
She's gone.

201
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,078
You mean dead.

202
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,039
Here.

203
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,392
Take this.

204
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,632
For luck.

205
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,711
How's that?

206
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,831
Don't go! Please!

207
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,480
Newt, I'm gonna be right in the next room.

208
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,191
And you see that camera?

209
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,953
I can see you through that camera...

210
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,759
...all the time, to see if you're safe.

211
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,278
I'm not gonna leave you, Newt.

212
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,918
I mean that.

213
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,877
That's a promise.

214
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,473
You promise?

215
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,792
I cross my heart.

216
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,518
And hope to die?

217
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,034
And hope to die.

218
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,632
Now go to sleep...

219
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,591
...and don't dream.

220
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,919
Sneak.

221
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,237
The molecular acid oxidizes after the
creature's death, completely neutralizing.

222
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,392
Bishop, that's interesting,
but it gets us nowhere.

223
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,076
I'm trying to figure out what we're dealing
with here. Let's go through it again.

224
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:08,439
They grab the colonists and immobilize them
to be hosts for more of these.

225
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,836
So there would have to be
a lot of these parasites.

226
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,229
One for each colonist.
A hundred at least.

227
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,151
Yes, that follows.

228
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,915
Each one of these things
comes from an egg, right?

229
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,431
So who's laying these eggs?

230
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,394
I'm not sure.
It must be something we haven't seen yet.

231
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,869
Hey, maybe it's like an ant hive.

232
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,032
- Bees, man. Bees have hives.
- You know what I mean.

233
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,669
There's, like, one female
that runs the whole show.

234
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,035
- Yes. The queen.
- Yeah, the mama.

235
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,793
And she's badass, man. I mean <i>big.</i>

236
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,950
- These things ain't ants.
- I know that!

237
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,511
Bishop, I want these specimens destroyed
as soon as you're finished with them.

238
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,152
Mr. Burke said they were to be kept alive
in stasis for return to the company labs.

239
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,315
He was very specific about it.

240
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,473
Those two specimens are worth millions
to the bio-weapons division.

241
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,950
If you're smart, we can both
come out of this heroes...

242
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,474
...and we will be set up for life.

243
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,194
You're crazy, Burke. Do you know that?

244
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,711
You really think you can get a dangerous
organism like that past ICC quarantine?

245
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,792
How can they impound it
if they don't know about it?

246
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,474
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.

247
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,838
Just like they'll know you were responsible
for the deaths of 157 colonists.

248
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,753
- Wait a second!
- You sent them to that ship.

249
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:40,039
I just checked the colony log: directive
dated 6-12-79, signed Burke, Carter J.

250
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,318
You sent them out there
and you didn't even warn them.

251
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,518
What if that ship didn't even exist?
Did you think about that? I didn't know.

252
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,718
So now if I make a major security situation
out of it, everybody steps in...

253
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,270
...and there's no exclusive rights
for anybody. Nobody wins.

254
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,718
So I made a decision and it was wrong.
It was a bad call, Ripley. A bad call.

255
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,828
Bad call? These people are dead, Burke!
Have you any idea what you've done here!

256
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,718
I'm gonna make sure
they nail you right to the wall.

257
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,234
You won't sleaze your way out of this one.

258
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,072
Right to the wall.

259
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,789
Ripley.

260
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,749
You know, I expected more from you.
I thought you'd be smarter than this.

261
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,671
I'm happy to disappoint you.

262
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,751
What is it? What's going on?

263
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,273
- They're coming.
- Where?

264
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,839
In the tunnel.

265
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,514
Here we go.

266
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,034
A and B gun tracking and firing.

267
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,553
Multiple targets.

268
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,951
Look at those ammo counters go.

269
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,516
B gun's down 50 per cent.

270
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,835
It's a shooting gallery down there!

271
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,272
60 rounds left on B.

272
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,397
40... 20... 10.

273
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,630
B gun's dry. 20 on A.

274
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,590
Ten...

275
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,999
...five...

276
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,074
That's it.

277
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,197
Jesus! They're wall-to-wall in there.

278
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,111
They're at the pressure door.

279
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,593
Man, listen to that.

280
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,195
<i>Bishop here. I'm afraid I have some bad news.</i>

281
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,032
Well, that's a switch!

282
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,236
It's very pretty, Bishop,
but what are we looking for?

283
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,312
That's it. Emergency venting.

284
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,952
That's beautiful, man. That beats it all.

285
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,837
How long till it blows?

286
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,831
Four hours...

287
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,357
...with a blast radius of 30 kilometers,
equal to about 40 megatons.

288
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,710
- We got problems.
- I don't fuckin' believe this!

289
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,031
Vasquez, close the shutters.

290
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,315
Why can't we shut it down from here?

291
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,032
The crash caused too much damage.
An overload was inevitable at this point.

292
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,636
Oh, man! And I was getting short!
Four more weeks and out.

293
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,076
- Now I'm gonna buy it on this rock!
- Give us a break!

294
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,628
Four more weeks. Oh, man!

295
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,632
We need the other drop-ship from the Sulaco.

296
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,714
Can't we bring it down on remote?

297
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,190
How? The transmitter was on the APC!
It's wasted!

298
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,431
I don't care how,
but we'd better think of something!

299
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,199
Think of what?!
We're fucked! We're doomed!

300
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,751
Shut up! What about the colony transmitters?
The uplink tower at the other end?

301
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,515
The hard-wiring between
here and there was damaged.

302
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,556
We can't align the dish.

303
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,839
Somebody has to go out there. Take
a portable terminal and patch in manually.

304
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,789
Oh, yeah, sure! With those things
running around? You can count <i>me</i> out.

305
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,633
- We can count you out of everything.
- I'll go.

306
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,836
- Why don't you go, man?
- I'll go.

307
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,911
- What?
- I'll go.

308
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,719
I'm the only one qualified
to remote-pilot the ship.

309
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,792
Yeah, right, man. Bishop should go.

310
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,995
Good idea!

311
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,150
Believe me, I'd prefer not to.

312
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,074
I may be synthetic, but I'm not stupid.

313
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,152
How long?

314
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,471
This conduit runs almost
to the uplink assembly. 180 meters.

315
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,632
- Say 40 minutes to crawl down there...
- Right.

316
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,395
...an hour to patch in and align the antenna...

317
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,388
...30 minutes to prep the ship,
and about 50 minutes flight time.

318
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,198
It's gonna be close.

319
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,674
- Good luck.
- See you soon.

320
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,792
Watch your fingers.

321
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,153
<i>Vaya con Dios,</i> man.

322
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,311
This is unbelievable!

323
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,472
20 meters and closing. 15.

324
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,709
How many?

325
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,314
Can't tell. Lots.

326
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,911
D gun's down 50 per cent.

327
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,917
C gun's right behind it.

328
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,797
It ain't stopping 'em.
It ain't stopping 'em!

329
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,075
150 rounds on D.

330
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,116
Come on, baby. Come on!

331
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,270
100 rounds.

332
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,639
Come on, come on!

333
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,879
D gun's down to 20.

334
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:03,871
Ten.

335
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,959
Damn it!

336
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,677
Wait!

337
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,352
They're retreating.

338
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,994
The guns stopped them.

339
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,633
You're right.

340
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,589
Next time they walk right up and knock.

341
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,750
Yeah, but they don't know that.

342
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,031
They're probably looking
for other ways to get in.

343
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,111
That'll take 'em a while.

344
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,589
- Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
- Shut up.

345
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,235
I want you two walking perimeter.

346
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,988
Move!

347
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,316
Hey, listen.

348
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,595
We're all in strung-out shape...

349
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,671
...but stay frosty...

350
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,751
...and alert.

351
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,553
We can't afford to let
one of those bastards in here.

352
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,916
All right. <i>Vámonos.</i>

353
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,119
How long's it been since you got any sleep?

354
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,316
24 hours?

355
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,798
Hicks, I'm not gonna end up like those others.

356
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,668
You'll take care of it, won't you?

357
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,552
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.

358
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,352
Let's just make sure
it doesn't come to that, all right?

359
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,396
All right.

360
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,198
Hey, I want to introduce you
to a personal friend of mine.

361
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,792
This is an M-41A pulse rifle, 10 millimeter...

362
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,078
...with an over-and-under 30 millimeter
pump-action grenade launcher.

363
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,037
Feel the weight.

364
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,876
OK. What do I do?

365
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,315
Pull it in tight here.

366
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,436
- Right.
- Lean into it.

367
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,436
All right, now it will kick some.

368
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,477
When the counter reads zero here, you...

369
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,710
- I press this up?
- That's right.

370
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,314
Get another one in quick. Slap it in hard.

371
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,073
- Right.
- Now you're ready to rock 'n' roll.

372
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,717
- What's this?
- The grenade launcher.

373
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,916
I don't think you want to mess with that.

374
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,992
You started this. Show me everything.

375
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,432
I can handle myself.

376
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,113
Yeah, I noticed.

377
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,797
How do you feel?

378
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,917
All right, I guess. One hell of a hangover.

379
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,956
- Look, Ripley, I just want...
- Forget it. Excuse me.

380
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,470
Shh, shh, shh.

381
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,271
It's OK. It's OK.

382
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,677
Newt. Wake up.

383
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,591
- What?
- Be quiet.

384
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,671
We're in trouble.

385
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,553
Agh!

386
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,631
Move, Newt!

387
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,590
Hey!

388
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,792
Help!

389
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,432
Help!

390
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,875
Hicks!

391
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,193
Say again, Bishop?

392
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,477
You've got it into auto-refuel mode
and it's sequencing right?

393
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,879
<i>That's right.</i>

394
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,518
Good. Stay on it.

395
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,915
Get back to me when you've
activated the launch cycle.

396
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,558
- He's at the uplink tower.
- Terrific.

397
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,271
- Hicks! Hicks!
- Help! Help!

398
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,839
Hicks! Help us!

399
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,478
Break the glass!

400
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,755
Break it, break it!

401
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,432
I'll try.

402
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,674
Ripley, I'm scared.

403
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,429
Me, too.

404
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,268
Stay here.

405
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,031
It's the med lab. Hudson!

406
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,032
Vasquez! Meet me in med lab! We got a fire!

407
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,111
<i>We're on our way.</i>

408
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,719
They're coming, Newt.

409
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,831
Urgh!

410
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,119
Aagh!

411
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,232
Shoot it out!

412
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,911
- Hudson!
- Jesus!

413
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,715
Oh!

414
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,550
Christ, kid, look out!

415
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,714
- Over there!
- Yeah!

416
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,955
- Ready?
- Yeah!

417
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,154
Hudson!

418
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,390
Yeah, all clear. Nailed the other one.

419
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,993
It's history, man.

420
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,189
Jesus!

421
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,918
Burke. It was Burke.

422
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,831
I say we grease this rat-fuck
son of a bitch right now.

423
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,559
It just doesn't make any goddamn sense.

424
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,308
He figured that he could get an alien
back through quarantine...

425
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,238
...if one of us was impregnated.

426
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,436
Whatever you call it.

427
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,158
And then frozen for the trip home.

428
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:39,392
Nobody would know about
the embryos we were carrying...

429
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,152
...me and Newt.

430
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,797
Wait, now. <i>We'd</i> all know.

431
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,318
Yes. He could only do it by sabotaging
certain freezers on the way home.

432
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,799
Namely, yours.

433
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,954
Then he could jettison the bodies
and make up any story he liked.

434
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,190
Fuck! He's dead.

435
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,431
You're dog meat, pal.

436
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,671
This is so nuts. I mean, listen...
Listen to what you're saying.

437
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,316
It's paranoid delusion. It's really sad.

438
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,598
It's pathetic.

439
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,717
Burke, I don't know which species is worse.

440
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,588
They don't fuck each other over
for a goddamn percentage.

441
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,672
All right, we waste him. No offence.

442
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,671
No! He's got to go back...

443
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,471
They cut the power.

444
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,518
How can <i>they</i> cut the power?
They're animals!

445
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,398
I want you two checking the corridors! Move!

446
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,153
Gorman, watch Burke.
Newt, stay close.

447
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,512
- I'll go this side.
- You do that, man.

448
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,033
- Anything?
- There's something.

449
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,192
It's inside the complex.

450
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,157
You're just reading me.

451
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,993
No, it ain't you.

452
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,310
They're inside the perimeter. They're in here.

453
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,392
<i>Hudson, stay cool. Vasquez?</i>

454
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,992
Hudson may be right.

455
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,072
- Get back, both of you.
- <i>The signal's weird.</i>

456
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,871
Must be some interference or something.
There's movement all over the place!

457
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,191
Get back to Operations. It's game time.

458
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,474
Newt.

459
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,751
Seal the door.

460
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,829
Hurry!

461
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,117
Come on! Come on, get back!

462
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,111
Work fast.

463
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,357
Cover your eyes, Newt. Don't look at the light.

464
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,638
Movement. Signal's clean. Range: 20 meters.

465
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,393
They found a way in, something we missed.

466
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,311
We didn't miss anything.

467
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,992
18...

468
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,991
17 meters.

469
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,878
Something under the floor, not in the plans.

470
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,473
- 15 meters.
- Ripley!

471
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,437
Definitely inside the barricades.

472
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,919
Let's go!

473
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,917
- That's right outside the door. Get back!
- This is a big fuckin' signal.

474
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,117
- How you doing, Vasquez?
- Almost there.

475
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,119
That's it.

476
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,558
12 meters.

477
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,672
11...

478
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,069
10...

479
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,913
- They're right on us.
- 9 meters.

480
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,197
- Remember, short controlled bursts.
- 8 meters.

481
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,478
7...

482
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,749
6...

483
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,957
- That can't be!
- It's reading right, man!

484
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,519
You're not reading it right.

485
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,235
5 meters, man - 4!

486
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,751
What the hell!

487
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,390
- Oh, my God!
- Give me the light!

488
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,678
There they go! Get 'em!

489
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,200
- Come on!
- Get 'em!

490
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,316
Do something, Gorman!

491
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,037
Look out! Look out!
There's more of 'em!

492
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,758
Get to medical!

493
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,913
Do it! Now!

494
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,991
Hudson! Look out!

495
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,590
Aagh!

496
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,309
Now!

497
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:01,996
Burke!

498
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,311
Open this door! Burke! Open it!

499
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,950
Agh!

500
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,514
Let's go! Let's go! Fall back!

501
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,276
Go!

502
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,193
Die, motherfucker!

503
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,599
Burke!

504
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,954
Hudson!

505
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,114
Hudson!

506
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,519
Motherfucker!

507
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,239
Come on! Come on! Come and get it, baby!

508
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,555
I don't got all day! Come on, you bastard!

509
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,950
Come on, you too!
You want some of this? Fuck you!

510
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,989
Aagh!

511
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,317
Fuck you!

512
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,679
- Hicks!
- Hudson!

513
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,799
Come on, Hicks!

514
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,869
Go!

515
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,313
It's locked!

516
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,957
Got it! Let's go!

517
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,715
Go! Go!

518
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,468
Move, Gorman!

519
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,959
Seal it!

520
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,149
Burke!

521
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,515
Goddamn you! Open this door!

522
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,237
Get back!

523
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,675
- Hurry up!
- Gorman, get out of the way!

524
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,751
- Ripley, this way!
- What?

525
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,311
Wait. Get behind me.

526
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,709
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast!

527
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,319
- Hicks!
- Come on, let's go!

528
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,354
Move!

529
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,473
- Which way to the landing field?
- This way.

530
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,272
Go right!

531
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,559
This way! This way.

532
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:30,150
- Which way?
- Straight ahead and left.

533
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,471
Bishop, do you read me? Come in. Over.

534
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,551
<i>The ship is on its way.</i>

535
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,598
ETA 16 minutes.

536
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,353
Good! Stand by there! We're on our way!

537
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,190
- Which way now?
- That way.

538
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,078
- No, wait! This way!
- Are you sure?

539
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,039
Vasquez, move!

540
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,872
- Right up here! It's just up here!
- Hicks!

541
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,951
We're almost there!

542
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,511
Newt, wait!

543
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,909
Newt!

544
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,874
Vasquez!

545
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,109
Go!

546
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,593
Ohh! Ohh, no!

547
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,629
Newt!

548
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,951
Up there!
There's a short cut across the roof!

549
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,029
Hicks!

550
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,110
You always were an asshole, Gorman.

551
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,871
Newt!

552
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,269
- Ripley!
- Newt!

553
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,197
Hicks! Hicks, get her! Hurry!

554
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,710
Oh! Hold on, Newt!

555
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,916
- I'm slipping!
- Don't let go!

556
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,991
- Ripley!
- Hold on!

557
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,991
- Help!
- Gotcha!

558
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,995
I gotcha!

559
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,074
Newt! No!

560
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,998
Come on! We can find her with this!

561
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,593
Stay where you are, Newt!

562
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,433
- Ripley!
- We're coming!

563
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,670
Ripley!

564
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,993
This way.

565
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,277
She's close.

566
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,112
Newt!

567
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,471
Ripley!

568
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,915
Where are you! Can you hear me!

569
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,157
- Newt!
- Here! I'm here!

570
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,309
Where?!

571
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,111
Newt, are you OK?

572
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,714
Gonna have to cut it.

573
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,236
Climb down, honey.
We've got to cut through.

574
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,955
Newt?

575
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,838
Now don't move. Stay very still.

576
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,195
OK.

577
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,840
We're almost there. Hang in there, OK?

578
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,437
Hicks! Hurry!

579
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,953
- I know!
- I mean it!

580
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,837
Newt, just stay still!

581
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,755
Aagh!

582
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,637
- Almost there!
- No!

583
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,029
Newt!

584
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,870
No! No!

585
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,349
- Let's go!
- No!

586
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,838
They don't kill you!
They don't kill you! They...

587
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:14,559
- She's alive! She's alive!
- All right! I believe you! She's alive!

588
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,631
We've got to go! Now!

589
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,509
Hicks...

590
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,318
Get it off!

591
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,674
Aagh!

592
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,955
Get it off!

593
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,473
Aagh!

594
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,273
Here!

595
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,749
Go!

596
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,155
Come on, you can make it!

597
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,512
Bishop! How much time?!

598
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,556
Plenty! 26 minutes!

599
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,029
- We're not leaving!
- We're not?

600
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,513
- Ripley...
- Bishop, she's alive. There's still time.

601
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,910
In 19 minutes this area
is gonna be a cloud of vapor.

602
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,719
- Hicks, don't let him leave.
- We ain't going anywhere.

603
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,998
- See you, Hicks.
- Dwayne.

604
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,749
It's Dwayne.

605
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,277
Ellen.

606
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,833
Don't be gone long, Ellen.

607
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,473

Ripley!

615
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,350
Grab on to me!

616
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,237

00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,751

627
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,515
Bishop!

628
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,397
Goddamn you!

629
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,591
Close your eyes, baby.

630
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,956
Look!

631
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,471
Come on! Come on!

632
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,039
Punch it, Bishop!

633
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,469
It's OK.

634
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,152
<i>We're OK.</i>

635
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,028
Hey.

636
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,111
We made it.

637
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,271
I knew you'd come.

638
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,311
He's gonna be all right.

639
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,870
He's just out. I had to give him
another shot for the pain.

640
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,838
We need a stretcher
to carry him up to medical.

641
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,512
OK.

642
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:34,319
I'm sorry if I scared you.
That platform was becoming too unstable.

643
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,393
I had to circle and hope that things
didn't get too rough to take you off.

644
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:39,913
Bishop...

645
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,234
- You did OK.
- I did?

646
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:44,594
Oh, yeah.

Get away from her, you bitch!

Come on! Come on!

Are we gonna sleep all the way home?

All the way home.

664

Can I dream?

01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,519
Yes, honey. I think we both can.

666
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,432
Sleep tight.

Affirmative.
