1
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,269
<i>Bio-readouts are all in the green.
Looks like she's alive.</i>

2
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,597
Well, there goes our salvage, guys.

3
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,431
How are we today?

4
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,158
Terrible.

5
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,800
Well, better than yesterday, at least.

6
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,030
- Where am I?
- You're safe.

7
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,120
You're at Gateway Station.
Been here a couple of days.

8
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,919
You were pretty groggy at first,
but now you're OK.

9
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,875
Looks like you've got a visitor.

10
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,795
Jonesy! Come here!

11
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,558
Hey, come here!

12
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,911
How are you, you stupid cat?

13
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,319
How are you!

14
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,033
Where have you been?

15
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,990
Guess you two have met, huh?

16
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,198
I'm Burke. Carter Burke.
I work for the company.

17
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,313
But... don't let that fool you.
I'm really an OK guy.

18
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,390
I'm glad to see you're feeling better.

19
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,314
They say that all the weakness
and disorientation should pass soon.

20
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,679
That's just natural side effects of such
a long hypersleep. Or something like that.

21
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,191
What do you mean?

22
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,191
How long was I out there?

23
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,474
Has no-one discussed this with you yet?

24
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,949
No. But, I mean, I don't...

25
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,916
...recognise this place.

26
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,954
No, I know. Uh... OK.

27
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,077
It's just that, uh,
this might be a shock to you.

28
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,549
- It's longer...
- How long?

29
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,709
Please.

30
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,998
57 years.

31
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,515
What?

32
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,837
That's the thing.
You were out there for 57 years.

33
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,637
You had drifted
right through the core systems.

34
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,154
And it's really just blind luck...

35
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,550
...that a deep-salvage team
found you when they did.

36
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,631
It's one in a thousand, really.

37
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,950
You're damn lucky to be alive, kiddo.

38
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,634
You could be floating out there forever.

39
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,590
You OK?

40
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,079
Uh...

41
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,434
Oh!

42
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,748
You OK?

43
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,709
Oh!

44
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,669
God!

45
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,159
Nurse! Please!

46
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,158
Someone get in here now!

47
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,673
<i>No!</i>

48
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,399
Now!

49
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,629
Hold!

50
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,596
Please!

51
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,830
Hold her!

52
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,795
Kill me!

53
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,913
No!

54
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,558
No!

55
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,911
<i>Bad dreams again?</i>

56
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,992
<i>- You want something to help you sleep?
- No.</i>

57
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,752
I've slept enough.

58
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,472
Jonesy... come here.

59
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,598
Shh!

60
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,472
It's all right.

61
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,711
It's all right now.

62
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,192
It's over.

63
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,073
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
Been running behind all morning.

64
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,833
Is there any word about my daughter?

65
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,469
Uh... I think we should worry
about the hearing now.

66
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,551
I read your deposition...

67
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,393
...and it's great.
If you stick to that, we'll be fine.

68
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,313
There are gonna be
a lot of heavyweights in there.

69
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,470
Feds, Interstellar Commerce Commission...

70
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,597
...Colonial Administration,
insurance company guys.

71
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,069
Do you have any news about my daughter?

72
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,558
Well, we did come up with some information.
Why don't we sit down?

73
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,359
I was hoping to wait until after the inquest.

74
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,759
Uh...

75
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,393
Amanda Ripley McClaren...
Her married name, I guess?

76
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,152
Age 66.

77
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,835
And that was at the time of her death...

78
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,709
...which was two years ago.

79
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,109
I'm real sorry.

80
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,829
Amy...

81
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,951
She was cremated...

82
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,510
...and interred at Westlake Repository,
in Wisconsin.

83
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,591
No children mentioned.

84
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,196
I promised her...

85
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,918
...that I would be home for her birthday.

86
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,635
Her eleventh birthday.

87
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,834
Ohh...

88
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,239
<i>They'd like to go back to this
point about the override destruct order.</i>

89
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,511
I don't understand this.

90
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,479
We have been here for three and a half hours.

91
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,552
How many different ways
do you want the same story?

92
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,030
Look at it from our perspective, please.

93
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,872
Please?

94
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,673
You admit to detonating the engines of, and
thereby destroying, an M-Class star freighter.

95
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,955
An expensive piece of hardware.

96
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,873
<i>42 million in adjusted dollars.</i>

97
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,315
That's minus payload, of course.

98
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,474
The lifeboat's flight recorder corroborates
some elements of your account.

99
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:08,395
In that, for reasons unknown,
the Nostromo set down on LV-426...

100
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,119
...an unsurveyed planet at that time.

101
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,910
That it resumed its course, and was
subsequently set for self-destruct by you...

102
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,353
...for reasons unknown.

103
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,510
Not for reasons unknown. I told you.

104
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,391
We set down there on company orders
to get this thing, which destroyed my crew...

105
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,755
...and your expensive ship.

106
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:33,472
The analysis team found no physical
evidence of the creature you describe.

107
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,152
Good!

108
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,630
That's because I blew it out
of the goddamn air lock.

109
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,473
Like I said.

110
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,155
Are there any species like
this hostile organism on LV-426?

111
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,549
No. It's a rock. No indigenous life.

112
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,996
Did IQ's just drop sharply while I was away?

113
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,995
Ma'am, I already said it was not indigenous.
It was a derelict spacecraft. An alien ship.

114
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,593
It was not from there.

115
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,478
Do you get it? We homed in on its beacon.

116
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:11,032
And found something never recorded once
in over 300 surveyed worlds.

117
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,637
A creature that "gestates...

118
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,359
...inside a living human host".
- Yes.

119
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,793
These are your words.

120
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,190
- "And has concentrated acid for blood."
- That's right.

121
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,236
Look, I can see where this is going,
but I'm telling you that...

122
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,471
...those things exist.
- Thank you, Officer. That will be all.

123
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,358
Please! You're not listening.
Kane - the crew member...

124
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,991
Kane, who went into that ship, said
he saw thousands of eggs. Thousands.

125
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,036
Thank you. That will be all.

126
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,750
<i>Goddamn it, that's not all! If one of those
things gets down here, that will be all!</i>

127
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:50,312
Then all this bullshit that you think is so
important... you can kiss all that goodbye!

128
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,718
It is the finding
of this court of inquiry that...

129
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,791
...Warrant Officer E Ripley...

130
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,758
...NOC 14472...

131
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,513
...has acted with questionable judgment...

132
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,832
...and is unfit to hold an ICC licence
as a commercial flight officer.

133
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,791
Said licence is hereby suspended indefinitely.

134
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,680
No criminal charges will be filed against
you at this time, and you are released...

135
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,719
...on your own recognisance for a six-month
period of psychometric probation...

136
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,078
...to include monthly review
by an ICC psychiatric technician.

137
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,551
These proceedings are closed.

138
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,911
That could have been... better.

139
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,753
- Look, I think... Ripley?
- Van Leuwen.

140
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,840
Why don't you just check out LV-426?

141
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,951
Because I don't have to.

142
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,431
The people there have never complained
about any hostile organism.

143
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,034
What do you mean? What people?

144
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,473
Terraformers.

145
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,312
Planet engineers.

146
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,428
They set up atmosphere processors
to make the air breathable. Takes decades.

147
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,239
It's what we call a Shake 'n' Bake colony.

148
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,835
How many are there? How many colonists?

149
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,758
I don't know. 60, maybe 70, families.

150
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,239
Do you mind?

151
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,631
Families.

152
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,519
Jesus!

153
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,474
I'll be down in maintenance, OK?

154
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,676
- Al?
- What?

155
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,159
- Hey, Al.
- What?

156
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,074
Remember you sent some wildcatters
out past the alien range last week?

157
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,149
Yeah.

158
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,231
One of them's on the horn.

159
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,835
Says he's on to something.
Wants to know if his claim will be honoured.

160
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,195
Why wouldn't his claim be honoured?

161
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,670
Because you sent them
on company orders, maybe?

162
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,231
Christ! Some honch in a cushy office on
Earth says "Go look at a grid reference".

163
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,312
We look. They don't say why and I don't ask.

164
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,676
I don't ask because it takes two weeks
to get an answer out here.

165
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,830
And the answer is always "Don't ask".

166
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,911
So what do I tell this guy?

167
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,709
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned,
if he finds something, it is his.

168
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,791
- Lydecker?
- What?

169
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,395
You kids are not supposed
to be on this level! Get out of here!

170
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,075
<i>You go in places we can't fit!</i>

171
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,913
So? That's why I'm the best!

172
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,676
Knock it off! If I catch you playing
in the air ducts again, I'll tan your hides.

173
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,716
Mom, all the kids play...

174
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,268
Annie, come and have
a look at this, will ya?

175
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,393
Folks, we have scored big this time.

176
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,992
What is it, Dad?

177
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,953
I'm not sure.

178
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,551
Let's see if we can't get
a closer look at this thing.

179
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,077
<i>- Shouldn't we call in?
- Let's wait till we know what to call it in as.</i>

180
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,955
That's about as close as we can get.

181
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,191
Should we take a look inside?

182
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,236
You kids stay inside. I mean it.
We'll be right back.

183
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,072
- OK.
- Bye.

184
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,479
Timmy, they've been gone a long time.

185
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,393
It'll be OK. Dad knows what he's doing.

186
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,755
Mayday! Mayday! This is Alpha Kilo
Two Four Niner calling Alpha Control!

187
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,718
This is Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner!

188
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,639
Hi, Ripley. This is Lieutenant Gorman
of the Colonial Marine Corps...

189
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,071
Ripley, we have to talk.

190
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,916
We've lost contact with the colony on LV-426.

191
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,151
I don't believe this.

192
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,310
You guys throw me to the wolves...

193
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,868
...and now you want me to go back out there?

194
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,349
Forget it. It's not my problem.

195
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,793
- Can I finish?
- No.

196
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,871
There's no way.

197
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,277
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.
I can guarantee your safety.

198
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,912
These Colonial Marines are tough hombres.
They're packing state-of-the-art firepower.

199
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,230
There's nothing they can't handle.

200
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,435
Am I right?

201
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,990
We've been trained to deal
with situations like this.

202
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,640
Then you don't need me. I'm not a soldier.

203
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,598
We don't know what's going on out there.
It may just be a downed transmitter.

204
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,671
But if it's not...

205
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,829
...I would like you there as an advisor,
and that's all.

206
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,636
What's your interest in all this?
Why are you going?

207
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,635
The corporation co-financed that colony
along with Colonial Administration.

208
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,871
We're doing a lot of terraforming,
building better worlds...

209
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,110
Yeah. I saw the commercial.

210
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,237
Look, I don't have time for this.
I've got to get to work.

211
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,357
Oh, right.
I heard you're working the cargo docks.

212
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,078
That's right.

213
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,879
- Running loaders and forklifts.
- Yeah. So?

214
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,191
Nothing. I think it's great
that you're keeping busy.

215
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,638
And I know it's the only thing that you
could get. There's nothing wrong with it.

216
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,350
What would you say if I told you
I could get you reinstated as a flight officer?

217
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,796
The company's already agreed
to pick up your contract.

218
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,313
If I go.

219
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,473
If you go.

220
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,791
Come on, that's a second chance, kiddo.

221
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,793
Get out there and face this thing.
Get back on the horse.

222
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,838
Spare me, Burke.
I've had my psych evaluation this month.

223
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,718
Yeah, I know. I've read it.
You wake up every night...

224
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,110
...soaked in sweat...
- I said no! And I mean it!

225
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,311
Now please leave.

226
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,791
I am not going back! And I am...
I would not be any good to you if I did.

227
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,915
OK.

228
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,035
Shh.

229
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,596
Would you do me a favour?
Just think about it.

230
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,151
Thanks for the coffee.

231
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,479
Aagh!

232
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,719
Ohh!

233
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,717
<i>Hello.</i>

234
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,071
<i>Ripley? You OK?</i>

235
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,799
Just tell me one thing, Burke.

236
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,838
You're going out there to destroy them, right?

237
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,399
Not to study.

238
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,118
Not to bring back.

239
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,872
But to wipe them out.

240
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,838
<i>That's the plan. You have my word on it.</i>

241
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,117
All right, I'm in.

242
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,154
And you, you little shithead...

243
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,231
...you're staying here.

244
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,231
They ain't payin' us enough for this, man.

245
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,837
<i>Not enough to have to
wake up to your face, Drake.</i>

246
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,909
What?

247
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,356
- Is that ajoke?
- Oh, I wish it were!

248
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,195
Hey, Hicks. Man, you lookjust like I feel.

249
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,675
All right, sweethearts,
what are you waiting for? Breakfast in bed?

250
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,035
Another glorious day in the Corps!

251
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,634
A day in the Marine Corps
is like a day on the farm.

252
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,030
Every meal's a banquet,
every paycheck a fortune.

253
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,678
Every formation a parade.

254
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,079
<i>I love the Corps!</i>

255
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,919
Man, this floor is freezing!

256
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,037
- You want me to fetch your slippers?
- Gee, would you, sir?

257
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,997
Look into my eye.

258
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,195
Fall in, people!

259
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,589
Come on, let's go.

260
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,432
I hate this job.

261
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,398
<i>Crowe! Wierzbowski! On your feet!</i>

262
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,356
<i>I'm talking about breathing,
not this frozen shit.</i>

263
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,874
<i>Yeah, Top, how about it?</i>

264
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,593
<i>All right, first assembly's
in 15, people. Shag it!</i>

265
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,280
<i>Hey, mira. Who's Snow White?</i>

266
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,750
She's supposed to be
some kind of consultant.

267
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,115
Apparently, she saw an alien once.

268
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,919
Whoopee-fucking-doo!
Hey, I'm impressed.

269
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,479
<i>¡Qué bonita!</i>

270
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,151
Hey, Vasquez.

271
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,357
Have you ever been mistaken for a man?

272
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,192
No. Have you?

273
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,077
Oh, Vasquez!

274
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,951
You're just too bad.

275
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,311
Hey, Top, what's the op?

276
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,868
It's a rescue mission. You'll love it.

277
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,511
There's some juicy colonists' daughters
we have to rescue from their virginity.

278
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,073
<i>Dumb-ass colonists!</i>

279
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,555
What's this crap supposed to be?

280
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,552
- Cornbread, I think.
- It's good for you, boy. Eat it.

281
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,839
I sure wouldn't mind getting more of that
Arcturian poontang. Remember that time?

282
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:26,278
- But the one that you had was male!
- Doesn't matter when it's Arcturian, baby!

283
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,318
- Hey, Bishop. Do the thing with the knife.
- Oh, please...

284
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,035
All right!

285
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,714
<i>I don't wanna see that, man.</i>

286
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,597
<i>Come on, man. All right!</i>

287
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,513
Hey, what are you doing, man?
What are you doing?

288
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,636
- Don't move.
- Quit messing, Drake!

289
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,199
Bishop! Hey, man!

290
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,510
- Do it, Bishop.
- Hey, not me, man!

291
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,716
Yeah, you. Don't move.

292
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,028
Trust me.

293
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:57,236
Aaaaggghhhhhh!

294
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,075
<i>All right, knock it off.</i>

295
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,070
Thank you.

296
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,352
Enjoy your meal.

297
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,079
That wasn't funny, man.

298
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,512
- Lieutenant Gorman?
- No.

299
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,477
- Mr Burke?
- Yeah, thanks.

300
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:24,429
Looks like the new lieutenant's too good
to eat with the rest of us grunts.

301
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,958
The boy's definitely
got a corncob up his ass.

302
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,673
I thought you never missed, Bishop.

303
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,432
You never said an android
was on board. Why not?

304
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,314
It never occurred to me.

305
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,278
It's common practice
to have a synthetic on board.

306
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,874
I prefer the term "artificial person" myself.

307
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,709
Right.

308
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,360
- Is there a problem?
- I'm sorry.

309
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,638
I didn't even... Ripley's last trip, the syn...
The artificial person...

310
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,870
...malfunctioned.
- Malfunctioned?

311
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,396
There were problems and...
a few deaths were involved.

312
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,552
I'm shocked.
Was it an older model?

313
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,200
Yeah. The Hyperdyne Systems 120-A-2.

314
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,510
The A-2s always were a bit twitchy.

315
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,797
That could never happen now
with our behavioural inhibitors.

316
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,919
It is impossible for me to harm,
or allow to be harmed, a human being.

317
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,991
You sure you don't want some?

318
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,634
Just stay away from me, Bishop.

319
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,477
Guess she don't like the cornbread, either.

320
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,398
<i>Squad! Atten-hut! Officer on deck!</i>

321
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,232
<i>As you were.</i>

322
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,788
Quickly, quickly. Settle down.

323
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,598
All right, listen up!

324
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,955
Morning, Marines. I'm sorry we didn't have
time to brief you before we left Gateway...

325
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,395
- Sir?
- What is it, Hicks?

326
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,472
<i>Hudson, sir. He's Hicks.</i>

327
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,312
What's the question?

328
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,029
Is this gonna be a stand-up fight, sir,
or another bug hunt?

329
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,033
All we know is there's still
no contact with the colony...

330
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,873
...and a xenomorph may be involved.

331
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,758
- Excuse me, sir. A what?
- A xenomorph.

332
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,515
It's a bug hunt.
What exactly are we dealing with here?

333
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,832
Ripley?

334
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,391
I'll tell you what I know.

335
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,195
We set down on LV-426.

336
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,114
A crew member was brought back
with something attached to his face...

337
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,191
...some kind of parasite.

338
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,919
We tried to get it off. It wouldn't come off.

339
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,798
Later, it seemed to come off by itself and die.

340
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,996
Kane seemed fine.

341
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,196
We were all having dinner.

342
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,512
It must have laid something inside
his throat, some sort of embryo.

343
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,318
He started...

344
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,391
Um, he...

345
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,472
Look, man,
I only need to know one thing:

346
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,551
Where they are.

347
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,200
- Go, Vasquez, kick ass!
- Anytime, anywhere.

348
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:07,717
Somebody said "alien". She thought
they said "illegal alien" and signed up!

349
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,836
- Fuck you, man.
- Anytime, anywhere.

350
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,433
Are you finished?

351
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,988
I hope you're right. I really do.

352
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,839
Yeah, OK, right. Thank you, Ripley.

353
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,310
We also have Ripley's report on disk.
I suggest you study it.

354
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,712
One of those things managed to wipe out
my entire crew in less than 24 hours.

355
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:38,113
If the colonists have found that ship, there's
no telling how many have been exposed.

356
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,553
Do you understand?

357
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,317
Anyway, we have it on disk, so look at it.

358
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,960
Any questions?

359
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,315
What is it, Private?

360
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,278
How do I get out of this chickenshit outfit?

361
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,032
You secure that shit, Hudson.

362
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,312
All right.

363
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,677
Now listen up.

364
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,110
I want this thing to go smooth
and by the numbers.

365
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,630
I want DCS and tactical
database assimilation by 0830.

366
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:16,748
Ordnance loading, weapons strip and
drop-ship prep details. We have seven hours.

367
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,111
Now move it, people!

368
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,478
You heard the man, and you know the drill!
Assholes and elbows!

369
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,949
Hudson, come here. Come here!

370
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,398
<i>I don't care if you are short, Hudson.
Get it done!</i>

371
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:48,270
- Sarge, you'll get lip cancer smoking those!
- Corporal, I want this loading lock sealed!

372
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,040
- How many more, Spunkmeyer?
- Last one.

373
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,917
Good. Take it away.

374
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,391
Clear behind.

375
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,998
Did you check number three?
Is this the non-op?

376
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,550
I feel like kind of a fifth wheel.
Is there anything I can do?

377
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,949
I don't know. Is there anything you can do?

378
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,510
Well, I can drive that loader.

379
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,831
I have a Class Two rating.

380
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,592
Be my guest.

381
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,918
Where you want it?

382
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,437
Bay twelve, please.

383
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,756
<i>We're a team and
there's nothing to worry about.</i>

384
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:30,073
We come here, and we gonna conquer, and
we gonna take some. Is that understood?

385
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,550
That's what we gonna do, sweethearts.
Gonna go and get some.

386
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,234
All right, people, on the ready-line!

387
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,958
<i>- Are you lean?
- Yeah!</i>

388
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,473
- Are you mean?
- Yeah!

389
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,596
- What are you?
- Lean, mean Marines!

390
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,679
Get on the ready-line! Get some today!

391
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,791
Get on the ready-line!

392
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,076
Move it out!
Move it out, goddamn it!

393
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,789
Get hot! One, two, three!
Get out! Get out! Get out!

394
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,077
Move it out! Move it out! Move it out!

395
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,754
One, two, three, four! One, two, three!

396
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,436
Absolutely badasses!

397
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,670
Let's pack 'em in! Get in there!

398
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,752
Move it!

399
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,833
- Let's go, let's go!
- One, two, three, four, five, six!

400
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,718
I want combat seating. You know your places.

401
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,230
Get those weapons stowed. Let's go!

402
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,311
Come on, settle down, people.

403
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,676
Lock 'em in, Hudson.

404
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,911
Ready to get it on? You know it!

405
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,594
OK, Bishop, let's go.

406
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,716
Roger.

407
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,471
I'm ready, man.

408
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,510
Ready to get it on! Go!

409
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,319
<i>Stand by. Cross-locking now.
Pre-launch auto-cycle engaged.</i>

410
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,790
Primary couplers released.
Hit the internals.

411
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,155
<i>Confirm cross-lock
and drop stations secured.</i>

412
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,038
<i>Affirmative.
All drop stations secured.</i>

413
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,039
Stand by. Ten seconds.

414
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,954
Stand by to initiate release sequencer.

415
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,439
On my mark.

416
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,755
We're on an express elevator to hell!

417
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,955
Going down!

418
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,918
Two, one, mark.

419
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,390
Whoo-hoo!

420
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,508
Switch to DCS ranging.

421
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,912
- 2-4-0. Nominal to profile.
- We're in the pipe. Five by five.

422
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,716
- We're picking up some hull ionisation.
- Got it. Rough air ahead.

423
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,995
We're in for some chop.

424
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,318
How many drops is this for you, Lieutenant?

425
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,834
38.

426
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,788
Simulated.

427
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,916
How many combat drops?

428
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,558
Uh, two...

429
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,918
...including this one.

430
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,197
<i>- Shit!
- Oh, man!</i>

431
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,154
Range 0-1-4. Turning on final.

432
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,793
<i>I got a bad feeling about this drop.</i>

433
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,429
<i>You always say
"I got a bad feeling about this drop".</i>

434
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,669
OK, OK.

435
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,070
When we get back without you,
I'll call your folks.

436
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,509
All right. Let's see what we can see.

437
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,076
Everybody on-line. Looking good.

438
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,196
Drake, check your camera.
There seems to be a malfunction.

439
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,474
That's better.

440
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,834
Pan it around a bit. Good.

441
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,550
<i>I'm ready, man. Check it out.
I am the ultimate badass!</i>

442
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,029
State-of-the-badass-art!

443
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,908
You do not wanna fuck with me.

444
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,797
Check it out.

445
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,190
Hey, Ripley, don't worry.

446
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,558
Me and my squad of ultimate
badasses will protect you.

447
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,238
Check it out.

448
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,196
Independently targeting
particle-beam phalanx.

449
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,838
Whap!

450
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:09,119
Fry half a city with this puppy!
We got tactical smart missiles...

451
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,911
...phase plasma pulse rifles, RPGs...
We got sonic electronic ballbreakers!

452
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,197
We got nukes.
We got knives, sharp sticks...

453
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,838
<i>Knock it off, Hudson!</i>

454
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,069
All right, gear up.

455
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,789
Two minutes, people. Get hot.

456
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,552
Somebody wake up Hicks.

457
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,836
- Coming around for a seven-zero-niner.
- Terminal guidance locked in.

458
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,717
Where's the damn beacon?

459
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,312
Oh, I see it.

460
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:56,231
- That's the atmosphere processor?
- Yep, that's it.

461
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,471
Remarkable piece of machinery.
Completely automated.

462
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,949
We manufacture those, by the way.

463
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,876
<i>OK, Ferro.</i>

464
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,190
Take us in low over the main colony complex.

465
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,795
Storm shutters are sealed.

466
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,589
There's no visible activity.
All right. Hold at forty.

467
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,513
<i>- Roger.
- Give me a slow circle of the complex.</i>

468
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,638
Structure seems intact.

469
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,231
They still have power.

470
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,153
<i>OK, Ferro.
Set down on the landing grid.</i>

471
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,277
Immediate dust-off on my clear,
then stay on station.

472
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,955
<i>Down and clear.</i>

473
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,110
Ten seconds, people. Look sharp!

474
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,271
I want a nice, clean dispersal this time.

475
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,831
Let's go! Move it out!

476
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,751
Head 'em out!

477
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,919
First squad up, on-line.
Hicks, get yours in a cordon. Watch the rear.

478
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,752
<i>Vasquez, take point.</i>

479
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,398
Let's move!

480
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,959
Move up.

481
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,271
Hudson, run a bypass.

482
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,198
Second squad, move up.
Flanking positions.

483
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,918
<i>Second squad, on-line.</i>

484
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,831
<i>You set?</i>

485
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,912
Go on.

486
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,479
Second team, move inside.

487
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,551
<i>Hicks, take the upper level.</i>

488
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,875
<i>Sir, you copying this?</i>

489
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,474
<i>Looks like hits from small-arms fire.</i>

490
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:45,588
<i>We got some explosive damages,
probably seismic survey charges.</i>

491
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,113
<i>Are you reading this?</i>

492
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,758
<i>Keep it tight, people.</i>

493
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,710
<i>Hicks, Hudson,
use your motion trackers.</i>

494
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,992
<i>Nothing.</i>

495
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,275
Not a goddamn thing.

496
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,751
Quarter and search by twos.

497
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,994
<i>OK, Dietrich, Frost, you're up.</i>

498
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,557
It's right in there.

499
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,194
- Now!
- Now!

500
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,874
Good one, Hudson!

501
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:56,909
Uh, sir, we have a negative situation here.
Uh, moving on, sir.

502
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,551
Wait, tell him to...

503
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,952
Hicks, back up.

504
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,792
Pan right.

505
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,792
There.

506
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,711
<i>You seeing this?</i>

507
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:23,958
<i>Looks melted. Somebody must have
bagged one of Ripley's bad guys here.</i>

508
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,758
Acid for blood.

509
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,957
<i>If you liked that, you're gonna love this.</i>

510
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,551
Quit screwing around.

511
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,790
Second squad, what's your status?

512
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,917
<i>We just finished our sweep.
Nobody's home.</i>

513
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,956
Roger. Sir, this place is dead.

514
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,600
<i>Whatever happened here, we missed it.</i>

515
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,031
The area's secured.

516
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,872
Let's go check their computer.

517
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,269
- It's not secure.
- The area's secured.

518
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:04,238
First team, head for Operations.

519
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,278
<i>- Hudson, get their CPU on-line.
- Affirmative.</i>

520
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,670
Hicks, meet me at the south lock.
We're coming in.

521
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:14,150
He's coming in. I feel safer already.

522
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,231
Pendejo jerkoff!

523
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,839
<i>Sir, we got the CPU on-line.</i>

524
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,399
<i>No problem.</i>

525
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,948
Good. Stand by in Operations.

526
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,558
OK, let's go.

527
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,672
Are you all right?

528
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,439
Yes.

529
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,272
Sir... They sealed off this wing at both ends.

530
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:32,070
Welded the doors, and blocked off
the stairs with heavy equipment.

531
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,072
But it looks like the barricade didn't hold.

532
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,432
- Any bodies?
- No, sir.

533
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,192
Last stand.

534
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,748
<i>Must have been a hell of a fight.</i>

535
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,831
Yeah, looks that way.

536
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:51,229
All right, Drake, this way. You should be able
to cut through the med lab to Operations.

537
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,831
<i>Lieutenant.</i>

538
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,438
Gorman.

539
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,276
Are those the same ones?

540
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:17,949
Careful, Burke.

541
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:31,875
Looks like love at first sight to me.

542
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,030
Oh, he likes you, Burke.

543
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,793
Two are alive. The rest are dead.

544
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,431
Surgically removed
before embryo implantation.

545
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:45,399
Subject: Marachuk, John J,
died during the procedure.

546
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,429
They killed him taking it off.

547
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,038
Yo, Hicks.

548
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,671
I think we got something here.

549
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,471
- Behind us.
- One of us?

550
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,438
<i>Apone, where are your people?</i>

551
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:08,195
<i>- Anybody in D-Block?
- Negative. We're all in Operations.</i>

552
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,589
- Talk to me, Frosty.
- Let's keep moving, baby.

553
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,510
- It's moving.
- Which way?

554
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,556
It's coming straight for us.

555
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,232
Straight up.

556
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,071
- Fuck!
- Hold up!

557
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,599
Ripley.

558
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,994
Hey... shh, it's all right.

559
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,514
- It's all right.
- Grab her, Corporal.

560
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,558
Don't be afraid.
Come on. We won't hurt you.

561
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,995
Shh... it's all right. It's OK.

562
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,152
Come on out. Come on. Easy, easy.

563
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,070
I got her!

564
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,037
Ow! Damn!

565
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,759
- Don't let her go!
- She's under the grill!

566
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:01,150
- Frost, get your light up here.
- Where'd she go?

567
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,831
Shine the light!

568
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,478
Down here.

569
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:09,198
Here. Here.

570
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,794
<i>Keep back. Don't scare her.</i>

571
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,474
- Grab her, man! We're gonna lose her!
- Damn it!

572
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,717
<i>Wait!</i>

573
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,998
It's OK. It's all right.

574
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,718
Don't be afraid.

575
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,232
See?

576
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,551
Wait! No, you don't!

577
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,950
It's OK! You're gonna be all right now!

578
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,076
<i>Shh!</i>

579
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,118
Easy! Easy!

580
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,033
It's gonna be OK. It's all right.
You're gonna be OK.

581
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,634
Shh, shh, shh!

582
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,472
Easy.

583
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,631
Easy.

584
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,714
- What's her name again?
- Rebecca.

585
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:56,110
Now think, Rebecca. Concentrate.

586
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,030
Just start at the beginning.

587
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,315
Where are your parents?

588
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,518
Look, Rebecca...

589
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:07,070
Gorman, give it a rest, why don't you?

590
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,397
Total brainlock.

591
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,190
Physically she's OK. Borderline malnutrition,
but no permanent damage.

592
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,350
Come on. We're wasting our time.

593
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,033
Try this.

594
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,151
It's a little hot chocolate.

595
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,197
There you go.

596
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,151
Whoop.

597
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,596
That good, huh?

598
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,709
Uh-oh.

599
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,951
I made a clean spot here.

600
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,237
Now I've done it!
Guess I'll have to do the whole thing.

601
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:05,354
Hard to believe there's
a little girl under all this.

602
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,951
And a pretty one, too.

603
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,278
You don't talk much, do you?

604
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:28,079
- Smoking or non-smoking?
- Just tell me what you're scanning for.

605
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:34,030
PDT's. Personal data transmitters.
Every colonist had one surgically implanted.

606
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:37,112
If they're within 20 clicks,
we'll read it out here.

607
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,316
So far, zippo.

608
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:44,599
I don't know how you managed to stay alive,
but you're one brave kid, Rebecca.

609
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,349
Newt.

610
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,353
- What did you say?
- Newt.

611
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,715
My name's Newt.

612
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,791
Nobody calls me Rebecca...

613
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,871
...except my brother.

614
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,313
Newt.

615
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,518
I like that.

616
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:05,629
I'm Ripley.

617
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,351
It's nice to meet you.

618
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,915
And who is this? Hm?

619
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,033
Casey.

620
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:16,914
Hello, Casey.

621
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,878
What about your brother? What's his name?

622
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,598
Timmy.

623
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:26,319
Is Timmy around here, too?
Maybe hiding like you were?

624
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,031
Any sisters?

625
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,399
Mom and Dad?

626
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:42,037
Newt, look at me.

627
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:46,193
- Where are they?
- They're dead, all right? Can I go now?

628
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,997
I'm sorry, Newt.

629
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:54,072
Don't you think you'd be safer here with us?

630
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,755
These people are here to protect you.

631
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,751
They're soldiers.

632
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:04,513
It won't make any difference.

633
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,431
Need anything else?

634
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,673
Hello, Bishop. Do you need anything else?

635
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:27,874
No.

636
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,476
Nice pet you got there.

637
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,232
Magnificent, isn't it?

638
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,834
Yo! Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!

639
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,279
Found 'em.

640
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:41,475
They alive?

641
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:44,711
Unknown, but it looks like all of 'em...

642
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,075
...over at the processing station...

643
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,798
...sub-level three...

644
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,189
...under the main cooling towers.

645
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,909
It looks like a goddamn town meeting.

646
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,116
Let's saddle up, Apone.

647
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,713
Aye, sir.

648
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:02,630
Let's go, people.
They ain't payin' us by the hour.

649
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,632
Head 'em out!
OK, Frost, you're driving.

650
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,236
It's OK. Don't worry. It'll be OK.

651
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,353
<i>I want a straight Vdeployment.</i>

652
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,271
<i>Second team on left flank.</i>

653
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,550
<i>Advance on axial six-six-four.</i>

654
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:09,949
<i>Tracker on-line.
Set the V-gain to filter R-F ambient.</i>

655
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:13,828
<i>Hudson, tracker on-line.
Left and right, little buddy.</i>

656
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:18,909
<i>40 metres in, bearing two-two-one,
there should be a stairwell.</i>

657
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:21,232
<i>Check. Got it.</i>

658
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:25,354
<i>You want sub-level three.</i>

659
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:31,191
<i>Let's go, people. Hudson,
you got the point. Hicks, watch our tails.</i>

660
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,238
Nice and easy. Check those corners.

661
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,991
<i>Check those corners.</i>

662
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,471
Watch your spacing.

663
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:44,313
<i>You heard the man. Don't bunch up.</i>

664
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,868
Your transmission's showing break-up.

665
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,953
<i>Probably getting
interference from the structure.</i>

666
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,031
<i>Use those lights.</i>

667
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:57,388
<i>Next one down,
and proceed on a two-one-six.</i>

668
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,516
<i>Roger, that's a two-one-six.</i>

669
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:04,712
<i>I'm not making that out too well.
What is it, Hudson?</i>

670
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,394
<i>You tell me, man. I only work here.</i>

671
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:23,959
What is that?

672
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:26,155
I don't know.

673
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,992
Proceed inside.

674
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:48,312
<i>Watch your fire
and check your targets.</i>

675
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,392
<i>Remember we're looking for civvies in here.</i>

676
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:01,274
<i>Easy.</i>

677
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:04,955
<i>Tighten it up, Frost.
We're getting a little thin.</i>

678
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,591
<i>Nice and easy.</i>

679
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,832
Looks like some sort of secreted resin.

680
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:15,595
Yeah... but secreted from what?

681
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,240
Nobody touch nothing.

682
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,150
Busy little creatures, huh?

683
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:25,236
- Hot as hell in here.
- Yeah, man, but it's a dry heat.

684
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,636
Knock it off, Hudson.

685
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:40,392
- Lieutenant, what do those pulse rifles fire?
- Ten-millimetre explosive-tip caseless.

686
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,598
- Standard light armour-piercing round. Why?
- Look where your team is.

687
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:48,036
They're right under
the primary heat exchangers.

688
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:48,836
So?

689
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:54,276
So, if they fire their weapons in there,
won't they rupture the cooling system?

690
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:57,591
- Yeah. She's absolutely right.
- So what?

691
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:01,753
This whole station is basically
a big fusion reactor.

692
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:03,954
Right?

693
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:08,631
<i>So she's talking about a thermonuclear
explosion and "Adiós, muchachos".</i>

694
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,280
Oh, great. Wonderful.

695
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,878
Shit!

696
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,189
Look.

697
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,589
Uh... Apone.

698
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:21,955
Look.

699
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:27,793
We can't have any firing in there. I want
you to collect magazines from everybody.

700
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:31,759
- Is he fuckin' crazy?
- What do we use? Harsh language?

701
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:34,752
<i>- Flame units only.
- Sir, I...</i>

702
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,513
<i>Just do it, Sergeant. And no grenades.</i>

703
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:43,033
All right, sweethearts. You heard the man.
Let's have 'em.

704
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:46,920
Come on, Vasquez. Clear and lock.

705
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,558
Damn!

706
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,831
You, too. Give it up, Ski.

707
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,309
Crowe, I want it now. Give it up.

708
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,671
<i>Right on, Vas.</i>

709
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:03,715
Let's go, Marine. Give it up.
Frost, you got the duty. Open that bag.

710
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:06,553
- Thanks a lot, Sarge.
- Hicks, cover our ass.

711
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,471
Head 'em out, people.

712
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:14,388
I like to keep this handy,
for close encounters.

713
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:15,879
<i>I heard that.</i>

714
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,356
<i>Any movement?</i>

715
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,908
<i>Nothing. Zip.</i>

716
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,232
Holy shit!

717
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:58,111
<i>Newt, go sit up front.</i>

718
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,394
Go on!

719
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:00,674
Now!

720
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,718
<i>Steady, people.
Let's finish our sweep.</i>

721
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:35,269
<i>We're still Marines, and we got a job to do.
Keep it moving.</i>

722
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,714
<i>Easy.</i>

723
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:09,915
- Top!
- What?

724
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,592
We got a live one!

725
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:15,753
- You're gonna be all right.
- Please... kill me.

726
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,671
<i>Stay calm. We'll get you out.</i>

727
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,791
<i>It's gonna be all right.</i>

728
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:22,678
<i>- We've got to get her out!
- What is it, Dietrich?</i>

729
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:23,556
Convulsion!

730
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,270
Ohh!

731
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:27,476
<i>Dietrich, get back! Get back!</i>

732
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:28,436
Aagh!

733
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,959
<i>Aagh!</i>

734
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:36,595
No!

735
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,512
<i>Frost, flamethrower!</i>

736
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,160
Get back! Flamethrower! Move!

737
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,358
<i>Movement!</i>

738
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,829
What's the position?

739
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,996
I can't lock in!

740
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,355
Talk to me, Hudson!

741
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:21,477
Multiple signals!

742
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:23,596
They're closing!

743
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,875
Go to infrared, people.

744
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:26,836
<i>Look sharp!</i>

745
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:30,037
What's happening, Apone?
We can't see anything in here.

746
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,076
Pull your team out, Gorman.

747
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:40,279
<i>I got readings in front and behind!</i>

748
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:41,509
Where, man?

749
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:42,715
<i>I don't see shit.</i>

750
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,950
He's right. There's nothing back here.

751
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,395
Something's moving and it ain't us!

752
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:50,239
Shit!

753
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:55,394
<i>Tracker's off-scale, man.
They're all around us, man! Jesus!</i>

754
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,838
Maybe they don't show up on infrared at all.

755
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:03,316
Aagh!

756
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,714
Aagh!

757
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,069
Frost!

758
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:09,876
Aagh!

759
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,351
Come on!

760
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:22,557
Aagh!

761
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:25,549
Jesus Christ, Apone! What is going on!

762
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,995
<i>Wierzbowski and Crowe are down!</i>

763
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,913
Dietrich! Crowe! Sound off!

764
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:31,955
Frost!

765
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,508
<i>Frost!</i>

766
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:38,953
Wierzbowski!

767
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:40,709
Wierzbowski!

768
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:44,753
<i>Let's rock!</i>

769
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:45,829
<i>Yeah!</i>

770
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:49,959
Who's firing? Goddamn it!

771
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,191
I ordered a "hold fire".

772
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:58,436
They're coming out of
the goddamn walls in swarms!

773
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:03,355
Uh, Apone, I want you to lay down
a suppressing fire with...

774
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:06,000
<i>Vasquez! Drake! Hold your fire!</i>

775
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,914
<i>Are you copying me?
Lay down a suppressing fire...</i>

776
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,752
...with the incinerators,
and fall back by squads.

777
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,798
Say again? All after incinerators.

778
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:19,431
Lay down a suppressing fire
with the incinerators, and fall back...

779
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:23,835
Aagh!

780
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,229
<i>Sarge!</i>

781
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:27,673
Apone...

782
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,318
...talk to me.

783
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,389
Apone?

784
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,630
- Talk to me!
- He's gone!

785
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:36,589
Get them out of there! Now!

786
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:39,638
- Shut up!
- Hicks, whoever's left, get the hell...

787
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,438
- Shut up!
- Goddamn it!

788
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:45,753
<i>Where's Apone?! Where's Apone?!</i>

789
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,832
<i>The Sarge is gone!
Let's get the fuck out of here!</i>

790
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,031
<i>Let's go, Marines!</i>

791
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:52,869
Hudson?

792
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,837
Vasquez?

793
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,915
<i>- Hudson, look out!
- Get it!</i>

794
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:00,833
<i>Hudson!</i>

795
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:03,718
<i>- Hicks! Hicks!
- It's too much! Fall back!</i>

796
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,472
I told them to fall back.

797
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:08,552
- I told them to fall back.
- They're cut off!

798
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,558
Do something!

799
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,150
Fuck!

800
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:13,675
<i>Keep movin'!</i>

801
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:14,829
Hold on, Newt.

802
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,599
Ripley, what the hell are you doing!

803
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,432
<i>Turn around!</i>

804
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:35,959
That's an order!

805
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:43,590
<i>- Get off me!
- Goddamn it, that's an order!</i>

806
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,319
You had your chance, Gorman.

807
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:58,992
Come on!

808
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,598
<i>Come on, Drake!</i>

809
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,239
<i>Let's move it!</i>

810
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,635
<i>Come on! Let's go! Let's go!</i>

811
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:25,992
<i>It's blocked, man!
We got to go around!</i>

812
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,752
Open the door! Hicks!

813
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,434
Drake! We are leaving!

814
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,153
Get them, Vas!

815
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,154
Run for it!

816
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,189
Shit!

817
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:45,154
- Let's go!
- Drake, come on, man!

818
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,558
Drake, come on!

819
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:58,476
Aagh!

820
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:01,230
- Aaaghhh!
- No!

821
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:04,952
<i>Fire in the hold!</i>

822
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:07,793
- He's gone!
- No! Drake's out there!

823
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,393
Put it out!

824
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:11,311
Drake's coming!

825
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,833
He's gone!

826
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:14,399
No, he's... not!

827
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,637
Forget him! He's gone!

828
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:25,231
Get on the goddamn door!

829
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:29,315
Eat this!

830
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:31,916
Aagh!

831
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:36,313
<i>Ripley! Go, go, go!</i>

832
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:46,676
Whoa!

833
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:47,556
Oh!

834
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,314
It's all right! We're clear!

835
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:42,836
Ripley, you've blown the transaxle!
You're just grinding metal!

836
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,512
Come on, ease down.

837
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:46,395
Ease down.

838
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,558
Ease down!

839
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:50,635
Ease down.

840
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:04,030
<i>You OK?</i>

841
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,271
I'm all right.

842
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,431
Get away from me, man!

843
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:12,918
- Lieutenant.
- What happened to Gorman?

844
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,912
I don't know... Maybe a concussion.

845
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,709
- But he's alive.
- No, man, he's dead!

846
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,395
<i>- Wake up, pendejo! I'm gonna kill you!
- Back off!</i>

847
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,311
Right now.

848
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,550
Somebody get me a first-aid kit.

849
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,835
Hey. Hey, look!

850
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:36,718
The Sarge and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
Their signs are real low, but they ain't dead.

851
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:40,315
- Then we go back in there and get them.
- I ain't going back!

852
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,277
You can't help them!

853
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:48,351
You can't. Right now they're
being cocooned just like the others.

854
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:56,230
Oh, dear Lord Jesus,
this ain't happenin', man.

855
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:59,596
This can't be happenin', man.
This isn't happenin'!

856
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,997
We've got seven canisters of CN-20.

857
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:06,595
I say we roll them in there
and nerve-gas the whole fuckin' nest.

858
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:09,672
It's worth a try, but we
don't know if it'll affect 'em.

859
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:13,594
Let's bug out and call it even.
Why even talk about it?

860
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:17,116
I say we take off and
nuke the entire site from orbit.

861
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,711
It's the only way to be sure.

862
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:24,917
- Fuckin' A!
- Hold on one second.

863
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,993
This installation has a substantial
dollar value attached to it.

864
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,399
<i>They can bill me.</i>

865
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,149
OK, look.

866
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:37,358
This is an emotional moment
for all of us, OK? I know that.

867
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:40,079
But let's not make snap judgments, please.

868
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:43,277
This is clearly an important species
we're dealing with...

869
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:46,636
...and I don't think anybody
has the right to arbitrarily...

870
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,438
...exterminate them.
- Wrong.

871
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:49,999
Yeah. Watch us.

872
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:54,915
Maybe you aren't up on current events,
but we just got our asses kicked, pal!

873
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,754
Look, I'm not blind to what's going on...

874
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:01,912
...but I cannot authorise that kind of action.

875
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:08,711
Well, I believe Corporal Hicks
has authority here.

876
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,991
Corporal Hicks is...

877
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:15,277
This operation is under military jurisdiction.

878
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:18,909
Hicks is next in chain of command.
Am I right, Corporal?

879
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,797
Yeah.

880
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,910
Yeah, that's right.

881
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,790
Yeah. Look, Ripley, this is
a multimillion-dollar installation, OK?

882
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,792
He can't make that decision. He's just a grunt.

883
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:32,869
No offence.

884
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,632
None taken.

885
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:37,035
<i>- Ferro, do you copy?
- Standing by.</i>

886
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:40,908
<i>- Prep for dust-off. We need immediate evac.
- Roger. On our way.</i>

887
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:45,670
I say we take off... nuke the site from orbit.
It's the only way to be sure.

888
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:49,872
Let's do it.

889
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:00,589
Let's go! Pick it up, Hudson.
Pick it up, baby.

890
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,436
All right. Set him down here.

891
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,431
Move it, Spunkmeyer. We're rolling.

892
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,594
Hold on a second. There's something...

893
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,671
<i>Just get up here.</i>

894
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,996
I'm in. Ramp closing.

895
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,639
Spunkmeyer.

896
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,149
Goddamn it.

897
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,797
Well, where the fuck...

898
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:07,637
Run!

899
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:51,796
Well, that's great.
That's just fuckin' great, man.

900
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,630
Now what the fuck are we supposed to do?
We're in some real pretty shit now, man!

901
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:58,790
Are you finished?

902
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:03,477
You all right?

903
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:11,955
I guess we're not
gonna be leaving now, right?

904
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:14,231
I'm sorry, Newt.

905
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,993
You don't have to be sorry.
It wasn't your fault.

906
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:20,356
That's it, man. Game over, man! Game over!

907
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:23,159
What the fuck are we gonna do now?
What are we gonna do?!

908
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:27,153
Maybe we could build a fire, sing
a couple of songs. Why don't we try that?

909
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:31,711
We'd better get back cos it'll be dark soon,
and they mostly come at night.

910
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,518
Mostly.

911
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:51,151
That's everything, right?

912
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:56,030
This is absolutely everything
we could salvage out of the APC wreckage.

913
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:59,317
We got four pulse rifles
with about 50 rounds each.

914
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:01,391
That ain't so good.

915
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,276
We got 15 of these M-40 grenades.

916
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,351
Don't touch that.

917
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:08,953
Dangerous, honey.

918
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:13,750
- Is that the only flamethrower?
- Yeah. It's only half full, but it's functional.

919
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:17,469
And another one's damaged.
I don't know about that one.

920
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:19,508
But the good news...

921
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:23,078
We got four of these robot sentries...

922
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:26,072
...with display and scanners intact.

923
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:28,754
They really kick ass. They'll come in handy.

924
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:32,628
How long after we're declared overdue
can we expect a rescue?

925
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:37,552
17 days.

926
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,311
17 days?

927
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:44,712
Hey, man, I don't wanna rain on your parade,
but we're not gonna last 17 hours!

928
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:48,315
Those things are gonna come in here
like they did before, and...

929
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,516
Hudson! Hudson!

930
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:56,309
This little girl survived longer than that
with no weapons and no training.

931
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,389
Right?

932
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:04,354
<i>- Why don't you put her in charge?
- You better start dealing with it, Hudson.</i>

933
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:08,149
Listen to me.
Deal with it, because we need you...

934
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:10,231
...and I'm sick of your bullshit.

935
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:14,552
Now get on a terminal and call up
a floor-plan file. Do you understand?

936
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:18,633
Construction blueprints. Anything that
shows the layout. Are you listening?

937
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,233
Yeah.

938
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:24,991
I need to see air ducts, electrical
access tunnels, sub-basements...

939
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:27,719
...every possible way into this complex.

940
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,472
We don't have much time.

941
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,152
OK.

942
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:35,311
- OK, I'm on it.
- Hudson...

943
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:37,072
Just relax.

944
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:44,597
I'll be in med lab.

945
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:47,990
I'll check on Gorman, continue my analysis.

946
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:48,990
Fine.

947
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:50,999
You do that.

948
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:00,515
So this service tunnel must be
how they're moving back and forth.

949
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:04,912
Right. It moves from the processing
station right into the sub-level here.

950
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:08,431
Come down on that.

951
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,317
OK, come over.

952
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,792
Hold it. Go back.
OK, punch that in right there.

953
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:21,070
- No. It's back here.
- OK.

954
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:25,080
Well, there's a pressure door at this end.

955
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:28,630
Couldn't we put a remote
sentry unit in the tunnel...

956
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:32,554
...and then seal that door?
- But we gotta figure on them getting in.

957
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:34,676
That's right, so...

958
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:38,309
...we repair the barricades
at these two intersections...

959
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:42,712
...and weld plate steel
over these ducts here, and here...

960
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:43,994
...and here.

961
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:47,512
Then they can only come at us
from these two corridors.

962
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:51,229
Right. Then we put
the other sentry units here...

963
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:52,912
...and here. Right?

964
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,991
- Right.
- Outstanding.

965
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:57,355
Now all we need is a deck of cards.

966
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:01,554
All right, let's move
like we've got a purpose.

967
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:04,279
- Affirmative.
- Affirmative.

968
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,638
Do your thing, baby.

969
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:23,029
Vasquez, let's get the hell out of here.

970
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:26,430
<i>- A and B sentries are in place and keyed.
- Roger.</i>

971
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,556
Stand by. Arming now.

972
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:30,039
Test it, Hudson.

973
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:32,429
- Do it!
- Fire in the hole!

974
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:38,433
OK! Let's get the hell out of here!

975
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,511
We're sealing the tunnel!

976
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:41,589
Come on, baby.

977
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,271
For what it's worth...

978
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:59,195
Here, I want you to put this on.

979
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,396
What's it for?

980
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:06,110
It's a locator. Then I can find you
anywhere in the complex... on this.

981
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,791
It's just a precaution.

982
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:11,519
Thanks.

983
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:14,514
Doesn't mean we're engaged or anything.

984
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:16,511
All right, what's next?

985
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:46,319
Last stop.

986
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,319
Get in.

987
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:53,948
Scoot down.

988
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:56,554
That's good.

989
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:58,949
Now you lie here and have a nap.

990
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,519
You're very tired.

991
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:03,831
I don't want to. I have scary dreams.

992
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:08,873
Well, I bet Casey doesn't have scary dreams.

993
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:10,673
Let's take a look.

994
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:13,316
Nope. Nothing bad in there.

995
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:14,549
See?

996
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:17,115
Maybe you could just try to be like her.

997
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:20,274
Ripley, she doesn't have bad dreams...

998
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:22,999
...because she's just a piece of plastic.

999
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:24,354
Right.

1000
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:26,512
I'm sorry, Newt.

1001
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:33,949
There.

1002
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:39,119
My mommy always said there
were no monsters. No real ones.

1003
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:41,156
But there are.

1004
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:44,277
Yes, there are, aren't there?

1005
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:48,599
Why do they tell little kids that?

1006
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:52,191
Most of the time it's true.

1007
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:55,590
Did one of those things grow inside her?

1008
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:58,148
I don't know, Newt.

1009
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:00,310
That's the truth.

1010
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,789
Isn't that how babies come?

1011
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,871
I mean, people babies?

1012
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:08,509
- They grow inside you.
- No. That's very different.

1013
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:10,477
Did you ever have a baby?

1014
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:11,993
Yes, I did.

1015
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:13,513
I had a little girl.

1016
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:15,477
Where is she?

1017
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:17,993
She's gone.

1018
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:21,598
You mean dead.

1019
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:24,559
Here.

1020
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:27,912
Take this.

1021
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,152
For luck.

1022
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:35,231
How's that?

1023
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:39,351
Don't go! Please!

1024
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:42,000
Newt, I'm gonna be right in the next room.

1025
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:44,711
And you see that camera?

1026
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,473
I can see you through that camera...

1027
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:50,279
...all the time, to see if you're safe.

1028
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,798
I'm not gonna leave you, Newt.

1029
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:58,438
I mean that.

1030
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:00,397
That's a promise.

1031
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:01,993
You promise?

1032
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:05,312
I cross my heart.

1033
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,038
And hope to die?

1034
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:09,554
And hope to die.

1035
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:25,152
Now go to sleep...

1036
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:28,111
...and don't dream.

1037
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:33,439
Sneak.

1038
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:46,757
The molecular acid oxidises after the
creature's death, completely neutralising.

1039
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:49,912
Bishop, that's interesting,
but it gets us nowhere.

1040
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,596
I'm trying to figure out what we're dealing
with here. Let's go through it again.

1041
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:59,959
They grab the colonists and immobilise them
to be hosts for more of these.

1042
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:04,356
So there would have to be
a lot of these parasites.

1043
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:06,749
One for each colonist.
A hundred at least.

1044
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:08,671
Yes, that follows.

1045
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:12,435
Each one of these things
comes from an egg, right?

1046
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,951
So who's laying these eggs?

1047
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:21,914
I'm not sure.
It must be something we haven't seen yet.

1048
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,389
Hey, maybe it's like an ant hive.

1049
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:27,552
- Bees, man. Bees have hives.
- You know what I mean.

1050
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:31,189
There's, like, one female
that runs the whole show.

1051
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,555
- Yes. The queen.
- Yeah, the mama.

1052
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:36,313
<i>And she's badass, man. I mean big.</i>

1053
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,470
- These things ain't ants.
- I know that!

1054
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:44,031
Bishop, I want these specimens destroyed
as soon as you're finished with them.

1055
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:49,672
Mr Burke said they were to be kept alive
in stasis for return to the company labs.

1056
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,835
He was very specific about it.

1057
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:58,993
Those two specimens are worth millions
to the bio-weapons division.

1058
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:02,470
If you're smart, we can both
come out of this heroes...

1059
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:04,994
...and we will be set up for life.

1060
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:08,714
You're crazy, Burke. Do you know that?

1061
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:13,231
You really think you can get a dangerous
organism like that past ICC quarantine?

1062
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:16,312
How can they impound it
if they don't know about it?

1063
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,994
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.

1064
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:23,358
Just like they'll know you were responsible
for the deaths of 157 colonists.

1065
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:26,273
- Wait a second!
- You sent them to that ship.

1066
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:31,559
I just checked the colony log: Directive
dated 6-12-79, signed Burke, Carter J.

1067
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:35,838
You sent them out there
and you didn't even warn them.

1068
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:40,038
What if that ship didn't even exist?
Did you think about that? I didn't know.

1069
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:44,238
So now if I make a major security situation
out of it, everybody steps in...

1070
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:47,790
...and there's no exclusive rights
for anybody. Nobody wins.

1071
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:53,238
So I made a decision and it was wrong.
It was a bad call, Ripley. A bad call.

1072
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:58,348
Bad call? These people are dead, Burke!
Have you any idea what you've done here!

1073
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:01,238
I'm gonna make sure
they nail you right to the wall.

1074
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:03,754
You won't sleaze your way out of this one.

1075
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,592
Right to the wall.

1076
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:08,309
Ripley.

1077
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:15,269
You know, I expected more from you.
I thought you'd be smarter than this.

1078
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:18,191
I'm happy to disappoint you.

1079
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:33,271
What is it? What's going on?

1080
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:34,793
- They're coming.
- Where?

1081
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,359
In the tunnel.

1082
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:39,034
Here we go.

1083
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:41,554
A and B gun tracking and firing.

1084
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:43,073
Multiple targets.

1085
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:50,471
Look at those ammo counters go.

1086
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,036
B gun's down 50 per cent.

1087
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:58,355
It's a shooting gallery down there!

1088
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:03,792
60 rounds left on B.

1089
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:06,917
40... 20... 10.

1090
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,150
B gun's dry. 20 on A.

1091
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:11,110
Ten...

1092
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,519
...five...

1093
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,594
That's it.

1094
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:20,717
Jesus! They're wall-to-wall in there.

1095
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:26,631
They're at the pressure door.

1096
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:30,113
Man, listen to that.

1097
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:33,715
<i>Bishop here. I'm afraid I have some bad news.</i>

1098
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:35,552
Well, that's a switch!

1099
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:40,756
It's very pretty, Bishop,
but what are we looking for?

1100
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:43,832
That's it. Emergency venting.

1101
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:48,472
That's beautiful, man. That beats it all.

1102
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:50,357
How long till it blows?

1103
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,351
Four hours...

1104
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:56,877
...with a blast radius of 30 kilometres,
equal to about 40 megatons.

1105
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:01,230
- We got problems.
- I don't fuckin' believe this!

1106
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:03,551
Vasquez, close the shutters.

1107
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:05,835
Why can't we shut it down from here?

1108
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:10,552
The crash caused too much damage.
An overload was inevitable at this point.

1109
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:15,156
Oh, man! And I was getting short!
Four more weeks and out.

1110
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:18,596
- Now I'm gonna buy it on this rock!
- Give us a break!

1111
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:21,148
<i>Four more weeks. Oh, man!</i>

1112
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:24,152
We need the other drop-ship from the Sulaco.

1113
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:27,234
Can't we bring it down on remote?

1114
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:30,710
How? The transmitter was on the APC!
It's wasted!

1115
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:33,951
I don't care how,
but we'd better think of something!

1116
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:36,719
Think of what?!
We're fucked! We're doomed!

1117
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:41,271
Shut up! What about the colony transmitters?
The uplink tower at the other end?

1118
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:45,035
The hard-wiring between
here and there was damaged.

1119
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:47,076
We can't align the dish.

1120
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:52,359
Somebody has to go out there. Take
a portable terminal and patch in manually.

1121
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:57,309
<i>Oh, yeah, sure! With those things
running around? You can count me out.</i>

1122
01:35:57,400 --> 01:36:00,153
- We can count you out of everything.
- I'll go.

1123
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:02,356
<i>- Why don't you go, man?
- I'll go.</i>

1124
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:04,431
- What?
- I'll go.

1125
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:07,239
I'm the only one qualified
to remote-pilot the ship.

1126
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:10,312
<i>Yeah, right, man. Bishop should go.</i>

1127
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:11,515
Good idea!

1128
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:13,670
Believe me, I'd prefer not to.

1129
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:17,594
I may be synthetic, but I'm not stupid.

1130
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:29,672
<i>How long?</i>

1131
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:32,991
This conduit runs almost
to the uplink assembly. 180 metres.

1132
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:36,152
- Say 40 minutes to crawl down there...
- Right.

1133
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:39,915
...an hour to patch in and align the antenna...

1134
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:44,908
...30 minutes to prep the ship,
and about 50 minutes flight time.

1135
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,718
It's gonna be close.

1136
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:53,194
- Good luck.
- See you soon.

1137
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:56,312
Watch your fingers.

1138
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:01,673
<i>Vaya con Dios, man.</i>

1139
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:15,831
This is unbelievable!

1140
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:18,992
20 metres and closing. 15.

1141
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:20,229
How many?

1142
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:22,834
Can't tell. Lots.

1143
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:25,431
D gun's down 50 per cent.

1144
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:32,437
C gun's right behind it.

1145
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:37,317
<i>It ain't stopping 'em.
It ain't stopping 'em!</i>

1146
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:39,595
<i>150 rounds on D.</i>

1147
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:41,636
<i>Come on, baby. Come on!</i>

1148
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:42,790
100 rounds.

1149
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:47,159
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

1150
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:53,399
D gun's down to 20.

1151
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:55,391
Ten.

1152
01:37:58,080 --> 01:37:59,479
Damn it!

1153
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:02,197
Wait!

1154
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:03,872
They're retreating.

1155
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:11,514
<i>The guns stopped them.</i>

1156
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:15,153
You're right.

1157
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:24,109
Next time they walk right up and knock.

1158
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:26,270
Yeah, but they don't know that.

1159
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:29,551
They're probably looking
for other ways to get in.

1160
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:31,631
That'll take 'em a while.

1161
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:34,109
- Maybe we got 'em demoralised.
- Shut up.

1162
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:37,755
I want you two walking perimeter.

1163
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,508
Move!

1164
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:49,836
Hey, listen.

1165
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:52,115
We're all in strung-out shape...

1166
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:54,191
...but stay frosty...

1167
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:56,271
...and alert.

1168
01:38:57,320 --> 01:39:00,073
We can't afford to let
one of those bastards in here.

1169
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:03,436
<i>All right. Vámonos.</i>

1170
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:14,639
How long's it been since you got any sleep?

1171
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:16,836
24 hours?

1172
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:21,318
Hicks, I'm not gonna end up like those others.

1173
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:24,188
You'll take care of it, won't you?

1174
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:30,072
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.

1175
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:35,872
Let's just make sure
it doesn't come to that, all right?

1176
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:37,916
All right.

1177
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:42,718
Hey, I want to introduce you
to a personal friend of mine.

1178
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:46,312
This is an M-41A pulse rifle, 10 millimetre...

1179
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:50,598
...with an over-and-under 30 millimetre
pump-action grenade launcher.

1180
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:52,557
Feel the weight.

1181
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:01,396
OK. What do I do?

1182
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:08,835
Pull it in tight here.

1183
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:10,956
- Right.
- Lean into it.

1184
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:13,956
All right, now it will kick some.

1185
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:17,997
When the counter reads zero here, you...

1186
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:20,230
- I press this up?
- That's right.

1187
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:24,834
Get another one in quick. Slap it in hard.

1188
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:27,593
- Right.
- Now you're ready to rock 'n' roll.

1189
01:40:28,120 --> 01:40:31,237
- What's this?
- The grenade launcher.

1190
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:33,436
I don't think you want to mess with that.

1191
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:36,512
You started this. Show me everything.

1192
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:38,952
I can handle myself.

1193
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:42,633
Yeah, I noticed.

1194
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:54,317
How do you feel?

1195
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:57,437
All right, I guess. One hell of a hangover.

1196
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:02,476
- Look, Ripley, I just want...
- Forget it. Excuse me.

1197
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:56,990
Shh, shh, shh.

1198
01:41:57,640 --> 01:42:00,791
It's OK. It's OK.

1199
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:11,197
<i>Newt. Wake up.</i>

1200
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:13,111
- What?
- Be quiet.

1201
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:15,191
We're in trouble.

1202
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:35,073
<i>Agh!</i>

1203
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:37,151
Move, Newt!

1204
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:58,110
Hey!

1205
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:08,312
Help!

1206
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:10,952
Help!

1207
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:12,395
Hicks!

1208
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:14,713
Say again, Bishop?

1209
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:17,997
You've got it into auto-refuel mode
and it's sequencing right?

1210
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:19,399
<i>That's right.</i>

1211
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:21,038
Good. Stay on it.

1212
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:25,435
Get back to me when you've
activated the launch cycle.

1213
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:29,078
- He's at the uplink tower.
- Terrific.

1214
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:35,791
- Hicks! Hicks!
- Help! Help!

1215
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:37,359
Hicks! Help us!

1216
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:38,998
Break the glass!

1217
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:41,275
Break it, break it!

1218
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:42,952
I'll try.

1219
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:05,194
Ripley, I'm scared.

1220
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:06,949
Me, too.

1221
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:13,788
Stay here.

1222
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:28,551
It's the med lab. Hudson!

1223
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:31,552
Vasquez! Meet me in med lab! We got a fire!

1224
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:33,631
<i>We're on our way.</i>

1225
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:39,239
They're coming, Newt.

1226
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:46,351
Urgh!

1227
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:54,639
Aagh!

1228
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,752
Shoot it out!

1229
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:17,431
- Hudson!
- Jesus!

1230
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:20,235
Oh!

1231
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:23,070
Christ, kid, look out!

1232
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:44,234
- Over there!
- Yeah!

1233
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:45,475
- Ready?
- Yeah!

1234
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:51,674
Hudson!

1235
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:53,910
Yeah, all clear. Nailed the other one.

1236
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,513
It's history, man.

1237
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:57,709
Jesus!

1238
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:02,438
Burke. It was Burke.

1239
01:47:05,120 --> 01:47:08,351
I say we grease this rat-fuck
son of a bitch right now.

1240
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:11,079
It just doesn't make any goddamn sense.

1241
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:17,828
He figured that he could get an alien
back through quarantine...

1242
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:20,758
...if one of us was impregnated.

1243
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:22,956
Whatever you call it.

1244
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:26,678
And then frozen for the trip home.

1245
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:30,912
Nobody would know about
the embryos we were carrying...

1246
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,672
...me and Newt.

1247
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:36,317
<i>Wait, now. We'd all know.</i>

1248
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:41,838
Yes. He could only do it by sabotaging
certain freezers on the way home.

1249
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:43,319
Namely, yours.

1250
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:48,474
Then he could jettison the bodies
and make up any story he liked.

1251
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:50,710
Fuck! He's dead.

1252
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:53,951
You're dog meat, pal.

1253
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:59,191
This is so nuts. I mean, listen...
Listen to what you're saying.

1254
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:02,836
It's paranoid delusion. It's really sad.

1255
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:06,118
It's pathetic.

1256
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:09,237
Burke, I don't know which species is worse.

1257
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:13,108
They don't fuck each other over
for a goddamn percentage.

1258
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:16,192
All right, we waste him. No offence.

1259
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:18,191
No! He's got to go back...

1260
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,991
They cut the power.

1261
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:24,038
<i>How can they cut the power?
They're animals!</i>

1262
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:26,918
I want you two checking the corridors! Move!

1263
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,673
Gorman, watch Burke.
Newt, stay close.

1264
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:36,032
- I'll go this side.
- You do that, man.

1265
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:02,553
<i>- Anything?
- There's something.</i>

1266
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:05,712
<i>It's inside the complex.</i>

1267
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:07,677
You're just reading me.

1268
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:10,513
<i>No, it ain't you.</i>

1269
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:15,830
They're inside the perimeter. They're in here.

1270
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:18,912
<i>Hudson, stay cool. Vasquez?</i>

1271
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:27,512
<i>Hudson may be right.</i>

1272
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:30,592
<i>- Get back, both of you.
- The signal's weird.</i>

1273
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:36,391
Must be some interference or something.
There's movement all over the place!

1274
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:39,711
Get back to Operations. It's game time.

1275
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:40,994
Newt.

1276
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:45,271
Seal the door.

1277
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:46,349
Hurry!

1278
01:49:46,440 --> 01:49:49,637
<i>Come on! Come on, get back!</i>

1279
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:51,631
Work fast.

1280
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:57,877
Cover your eyes, Newt. Don't look at the light.

1281
01:49:57,960 --> 01:50:02,158
Movement. Signal's clean. Range: 20 metres.

1282
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:04,913
They found a way in, something we missed.

1283
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,831
We didn't miss anything.

1284
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:08,512
18...

1285
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:10,511
17 metres.

1286
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:13,398
Something under the floor, not in the plans.

1287
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:14,993
- 15 metres.
- Ripley!

1288
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:16,957
Definitely inside the barricades.

1289
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:18,439
Let's go!

1290
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:24,437
- That's right outside the door. Get back!
- This is a big fuckin' signal.

1291
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:27,637
- How you doing, Vasquez?
- Almost there.

1292
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:30,639
That's it.

1293
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:33,078
12 metres.

1294
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:35,192
11...

1295
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:36,589
10...

1296
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:39,433
- They're right on us.
- 9 metres.

1297
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:42,717
- Remember, short controlled bursts.
- 8 metres.

1298
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:46,998
7...

1299
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:49,269
6...

1300
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:52,477
- That can't be!
- It's reading right, man!

1301
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:54,039
You're not reading it right.

1302
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:58,755
5 metres, man - 4!

1303
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:01,271
What the hell!

1304
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:06,910
- Oh, my God!
- Give me the light!

1305
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:26,198
There they go! Get 'em!

1306
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:30,720
- Come on!
- Get 'em!

1307
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:33,836
Do something, Gorman!

1308
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:38,557
<i>Look out! Look out!
There's more of 'em!</i>

1309
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:40,278
Get to medical!

1310
01:51:40,920 --> 01:51:42,433
Do it! Now!

1311
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:44,511
<i>Hudson! Look out!</i>

1312
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:49,110
Aagh!

1313
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:50,829
Now!

1314
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:53,516
Burke!

1315
01:51:56,680 --> 01:51:59,831
Open this door! Burke! Open it!

1316
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:01,470
Agh!

1317
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:04,034
Let's go! Let's go! Fall back!

1318
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:07,796
Go!

1319
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:10,713
Die, motherfucker!

1320
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:12,119
Burke!

1321
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:13,474
Hudson!

1322
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:15,634
Hudson!

1323
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:17,039
Motherfucker!

1324
01:52:17,120 --> 01:52:19,759
Come on! Come on! Come and get it, baby!

1325
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:24,075
I don't got all day! Come on, you bastard!

1326
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:27,470
Come on, you too!
You want some of this? Fuck you!

1327
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:29,509
Aagh!

1328
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:31,837
Fuck you!

1329
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:34,199
- Hicks!
- Hudson!

1330
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:44,319
Come on, Hicks!

1331
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:45,389
Go!

1332
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:46,833
<i>It's locked!</i>

1333
01:53:04,680 --> 01:53:06,477
Got it! Let's go!

1334
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:08,235
Go! Go!

1335
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:11,988
Move, Gorman!

1336
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:13,479
Seal it!

1337
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:15,669
Burke!

1338
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:18,035
Goddamn you! Open this door!

1339
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:30,757
Get back!

1340
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:33,195
- Hurry up!
- Gorman, get out of the way!

1341
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:35,271
- Ripley, this way!
- What?

1342
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:37,831
Wait. Get behind me.

1343
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:40,229
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast!

1344
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:45,839
- Hicks!
- Come on, let's go!

1345
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:48,874
Move!

1346
01:53:55,240 --> 01:53:57,993
- Which way to the landing field?
- This way.

1347
01:54:03,200 --> 01:54:04,792
Go right!

1348
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:10,079
This way! This way.

1349
01:54:18,360 --> 01:54:21,670
- Which way?
- Straight ahead and left.

1350
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:24,991
Bishop, do you read me? Come in. Over.

1351
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:27,071
<i>The ship is on its way.</i>

1352
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:30,118
ETA 16 minutes.

1353
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:32,873
Good! Stand by there! We're on our way!

1354
01:54:43,640 --> 01:54:45,710
- Which way now?
- That way.

1355
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:48,598
- No, wait! This way!
- Are you sure?

1356
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:51,559
Vasquez, move!

1357
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:57,392
- Right up here! It's just up here!
- Hicks!

1358
01:54:57,480 --> 01:54:59,471
We're almost there!

1359
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:02,031
Newt, wait!

1360
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:03,429
Newt!

1361
01:55:27,200 --> 01:55:28,394
Vasquez!

1362
01:55:29,640 --> 01:55:30,629
Go!

1363
01:55:32,440 --> 01:55:35,113
Ohh! Ohh, no!

1364
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:48,149
Newt!

1365
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:51,471
Up there!
There's a short cut across the roof!

1366
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:53,549
Hicks!

1367
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:04,630
You always were an asshole, Gorman.

1368
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:23,391
<i>Newt!</i>

1369
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:25,789
- Ripley!
- Newt!

1370
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:29,717
Hicks! Hicks, get her! Hurry!

1371
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,230
Oh! Hold on, Newt!

1372
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:37,436
- I'm slipping!
- Don't let go!

1373
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:39,511
- Ripley!
- Hold on!

1374
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:41,511
- Help!
- Gotcha!

1375
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:43,515
I gotcha!

1376
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,594
Newt! No!

1377
01:56:52,640 --> 01:56:55,518
Come on! We can find her with this!

1378
01:56:55,600 --> 01:56:57,113
Stay where you are, Newt!

1379
01:56:57,200 --> 01:56:59,953
<i>- Ripley!
- We're coming!</i>

1380
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:13,190
Ripley!

1381
01:57:17,080 --> 01:57:18,513
This way.

1382
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,797
She's close.

1383
01:57:21,880 --> 01:57:23,632
Newt!

1384
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,991
Ripley!

1385
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:30,435
Where are you! Can you hear me!

1386
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:34,677
- Newt!
- Here! I'm here!

1387
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:35,829
Where?!

1388
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:42,631
Newt, are you OK?

1389
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:45,234
Gonna have to cut it.

1390
01:57:45,320 --> 01:57:48,756
Climb down, honey.
We've got to cut through.

1391
01:57:56,440 --> 01:57:57,475
Newt?

1392
01:57:57,560 --> 01:58:00,358
Now don't move. Stay very still.

1393
01:58:00,440 --> 01:58:02,715
OK.

1394
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:05,360
We're almost there. Hang in there, OK?

1395
01:58:12,160 --> 01:58:13,957
Hicks! Hurry!

1396
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:15,473
- I know!
- I mean it!

1397
01:58:29,480 --> 01:58:31,357
Newt, just stay still!

1398
01:58:35,240 --> 01:58:36,275
Aagh!

1399
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:38,157
- Almost there!
- No!

1400
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:41,549
Newt!

1401
01:58:53,240 --> 01:58:55,390
<i>No! No!</i>

1402
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:57,869
- Let's go!
- No!

1403
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:01,358
They don't kill you!
They don't kill you! They...

1404
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:06,079
- She's alive! She's alive!
- All right! I believe you! She's alive!

1405
01:59:06,160 --> 01:59:08,151
We've got to go! Now!

1406
01:59:37,880 --> 01:59:39,029
Hicks...

1407
01:59:39,120 --> 01:59:40,838
Get it off!

1408
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:42,194
Aagh!

1409
01:59:42,280 --> 01:59:44,475
Get it off!

1410
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:45,993
Aagh!

1411

1412
01:59:58,120 --> 01:59:59,269
Go!

1413
02:00:02,480 --> 02:00:04,675
Come on, you can make it!

1414
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:30,032
Bishop! How much time?!

1415
02:00:30,120 --> 02:00:32,076
Plenty! 26 minutes!

1416
02:00:32,160 --> 02:00:34,549
- We're not leaving!
- We're not?

1417
02:01:56,120 --> 02:02:00,033
- Ripley...
- Bishop, she's alive. There's still time.

1418
02:02:00,120 --> 02:02:03,430
In 19 minutes this area
is gonna be a cloud of vapour.

1419
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:06,239
- Hicks, don't let him leave.
- We ain't going anywhere.

1420
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:11,518
- See you, Hicks.
- Dwayne.

1421
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:14,269
It's Dwayne.

1422
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:17,797
Ellen.

1423
02:02:18,680 --> 02:02:21,353
Don't be gone long, Ellen.

02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:10,239
Ripley!

1431
02:07:10,720 --> 02:07:11,914
Ripley!

1432
02:07:25,720 --> 02:07:27,870
Grab on to me!

1433
02:07:27,960 --> 02:07:29,757
Hold on!

1434
02:11:11,200 --> 02:11:13,191
<i>Let's go!</i>

1435
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,389
Behind us!

1436
02:12:07,320 --> 02:12:12,952
<i>Attention. Emergency.
All personnel must evacuate immediately.</i>

1437
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:21,356
<i>Attention. Emergency.
All personnel must evacuate immediately.</i>

1438
02:12:21,960 --> 02:12:26,795
<i>You now have four minutes
to reach minimum safe distance.</i>

1439
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:44,275
Come on, goddamn it!

1440
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:51,271
Hold on to me!

1441
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:44,594
<i>Attention. Emergency.
All personnel must evacuate immediately.</i>

1442
02:13:46,320 --> 02:13:50,029
<i>You now have two minutes
to reach minimum safe distance.</i>

1443
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:58,989
No!

1444
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:03,035
Bishop!

1445
02:14:03,120 --> 02:14:04,917
Goddamn you!

1446
02:15:06,120 --> 02:15:08,111
Close your eyes, baby.

1447
02:15:10,520 --> 02:15:12,476
<i>Look!</i>

1448
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:20,991
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

1449
02:15:48,240 --> 02:15:49,559
Punch it, Bishop!

1450
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:34,989
It's OK.

1451
02:16:35,080 --> 02:16:36,672
<i>We're OK.</i>

1452
02:16:45,320 --> 02:16:46,548
Hey.

1453
02:16:48,640 --> 02:16:50,631
We made it.

1454
02:16:50,800 --> 02:16:52,791
I knew you'd come.

1455
02:17:06,840 --> 02:17:08,831
He's gonna be all right.

1456
02:17:08,920 --> 02:17:12,390
He's just out. I had to give him
another shot for the pain.

1457
02:17:12,480 --> 02:17:15,358
We need a stretcher
to carry him up to medical.

1458
02:17:15,440 --> 02:17:17,032
OK.

1459
02:17:21,880 --> 02:17:25,839
I'm sorry if I scared you.
That platform was becoming too unstable.

1460
02:17:25,920 --> 02:17:29,913
I had to circle and hope that things
didn't get too rough to take you off.

1461
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:31,433
Bishop...

1462
02:17:32,240 --> 02:17:34,754
- You did OK.
- I did?

1463
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:36,114
Oh, yeah.

1464
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:16,036
Go! Move!

1465
02:18:18,360 --> 02:18:21,432
No! Here! Here!

1466
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:23,431
Run!

1467
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:30,038
Here!

1468
02:19:55,120 --> 02:19:57,315
Get away from her, you bitch!

1469
02:20:19,480 --> 02:20:21,914
Come on! Come on!

1470
02:21:26,600 --> 02:21:27,749
Aagh!

1471
02:21:31,560 --> 02:21:32,197
Aagh!

1472
02:21:40,520 --> 02:21:41,157
Aagh!

1473
02:21:46,720 --> 02:21:47,630
Ripley!

1474
02:22:23,800 --> 02:22:25,916
Ohh!

1475
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:26,955
Aagh!

1476
02:22:57,560 --> 02:22:59,949
Bishop!

1477
02:23:44,600 --> 02:23:46,795
- Mommy!
- Oh, God!

1478
02:23:50,200 --> 02:23:53,272
Not bad for a... human.

1479
02:24:38,680 --> 02:24:41,353
Are we gonna sleep all the way home?

1480
02:24:41,440 --> 02:24:42,839
All the way home.

1481
02:24:42,920 --> 02:24:44,319
Can I dream?

1482
02:24:46,320 --> 02:24:49,039
Yes, honey. I think we both can.

1483
02:24:56,360 --> 02:24:57,952
Sleep tight.

1484
02:24:58,040 --> 02:24:59,632
Affirmative.
