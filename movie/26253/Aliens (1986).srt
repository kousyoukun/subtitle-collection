00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:05,562
Bio readouts are all in the green.
Looks like she's alive.

3
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,768
Well, there goes our salvage, guys.

4
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:40,339
How are we today?
Ohh. Terrible.

5
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:43,285
Well, better than yesterday, at least.

6
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,137
Where am I?
You're safe.

7
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,624
You're at Gateway Station.
Been here a couple of days.

8
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:52,127
You were pretty groggy at first,
but now you're okay.

9
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:55,287
Oh, looks like you've got a visitor.

10
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,941
Jonesy. Come here.

11
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,236
Hey, come here.

12
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,697
How are you,
you stupid cat?

13
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:08,701
How are you?
Where have you been?

14
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,897
Guess you two have met, huh?

15
00:06:10,997 --> 00:06:12,606
I'm Burke. Carter Burke.

16
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:16,603
I work for the company,
but don't let that fool you.

17
00:06:16,703 --> 00:06:18,445
I'm really an okay guy.

18
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,447
I'm glad to see you're feeling a little better.

19
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,134
They tell me that all
the weakness and disorientation...

20
00:06:23,234 --> 00:06:24,117
...should pass soon.

21
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:28,588
That's just natural side effects
of such an unusually long hypersleep,

22
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,082
or something like that.

23
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,349
What do you mean?

24
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,810
How long was I out there?

25
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,964
Inhalation Therapy, report to-

26
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,299
Has no one discussed this with you yet?

27
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,400
No.
But, I mean...

28
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:45,488
I don't... recognize this place.

29
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,573
No, I know. Uh-

30
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,223
Okay. It's just that,
uh, this might be...

31
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:51,395
...a shock to you.

32
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:54,080
It's long- How long?

33
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,165
Please.

34
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:01,128
57 years.
What?

35
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:04,310
That's the thing.
You were out there...

36
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,450
...for 57 years.

37
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,161
What happened was you had drifted...

38
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,662
...right through the core systems.

39
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,652
And it's really just blind luck...

40
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,876
...that a deep-salvage team
found you when they did.

41
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,254
It's one in a thousand,
really.

42
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:20,371
I think you're damn lucky
to be alive, kiddo. You could...

43
00:07:20,471 --> 00:07:22,050
...be floating out there forever.

44
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,361
You- You okay?

45
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,280
Uhh-

46
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,537
Uuh.

47
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,872
You okay?

48
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:46,215
Oh-h-h. Oh, God.

49
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:51,178
Nurse. Please.
God.

50
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,265
Someone get in here now.

51
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,392
Now.

52
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,686
Hold.
- Please.

53
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,980
Hold on.

54
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,065
Kill me.

55
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,660
No.

56
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,746
Uh.

57
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,540
Bad dreams again?
You want something...

58
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,570
...to help you sleep?

59
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,921
No.

60
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,007
I've slept enough.

61
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,177
Jonesy.

62
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,263
Come here.

63
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,432
Shh.

64
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,730
It's all right.

65
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:47,526
It's all right now.

66
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,653
It's over.

67
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:14,845
Dr Hirsch, 334. Dr. Hirsch, 334.

68
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,784
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
I've been running behind...

69
00:09:16,884 --> 00:09:17,374
...all morning.

70
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,252
Is there any word about my daughter?

71
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,345
Uh... I really think we should worry...

72
00:09:22,445 --> 00:09:23,755
...about the hearing now.

73
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:27,217
'Cause we don't have a lot of time, okay?
I read your deposition, and it's great.

74
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,140
If you just stick to that,
I think we'll be fine.

75
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,345
The thing to remember is,

76
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,389
there're gonna be a lot
of heavyweights in there.

77
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,546
You've got feds and Interstellar

78
00:09:33,646 --> 00:09:34,474
Commerce Commission,

79
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,644
Colonial Administration,
insurance company guys-

80
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:41,059
Do you have any news about my daughter?

81
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,478
Well, we did come up
with some information.

82
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:45,986
Why don't we sit down?

83
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,155
I was hoping to wait until after the inquest.

84
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,256
Um-

85
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:57,262
Amanda Ripley-McClaren-
married name, I guess-

86
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,515
Age 66.

87
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,829
And that was at the time of her death,

88
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,313
which was two years ago.

89
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,650
I'm real sorry.

90
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,785
Amy.

91
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:27,085
She was cremated and interred
at Westlake Repository,

92
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:28,528
Little Chute, Wisconsin.

93
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,006
No children. I checked.

94
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,579
I promised her...
that I'd be home...

95
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,679
...for her birthday.

96
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,229
Her 11th birthday.

97
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,405
I'd just like to go, uh-...

98
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,640
...back to this point about
the override destruct order.

99
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,325
Is it in the file?
I don't understand this.

100
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,687
We have been here
for three and a half hours.

101
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,505
Now, how many different ways
do you want me to tell...

102
00:11:05,605 --> 00:11:06,399
...the same story?

103
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:10,221
Look at it from our perspective,

104
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:11,112
please.

105
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,213
Please?

106
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,078
Now, you freely admit to
detonating the engines of,

107
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,997
and thereby destroying,
an M-class starsreighter,

108
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,541
a rather expensive piece of hardware.

109
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,871
Forty-two million in adjusted dollars.

110
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,688
That's minus payload,
of course.

111
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:33,113
The lifeboat's flight recorder
corroborates some elements...

112
00:11:33,213 --> 00:11:34,135
...of your account,

113
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:38,427
in that, for reasons unknown,
the Nostromo set down...

114
00:11:38,527 --> 00:11:39,265
...on LV-426,

115
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:43,895
an unsurveyed planet at that time,
that it resumed its course...

116
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,904
...and was subsequently
set for self-destruct...

117
00:11:47,004 --> 00:11:48,900
...by you for reasons unknown.

118
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,361
Not for reasons unknown.
I told you.

119
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:55,206
We set down there
on company orders to get this thing,

120
00:11:55,306 --> 00:11:57,158
which destroyed my crew...

121
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,718
...and your expensive ship.

122
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,121
The analysis team,
which went over the lifeboat...

123
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,456
...centimetre by centimetre,

124
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,668
found no physical evidence
of the creature you describe.

125
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,201
Good.
That's because I blew it...

126
00:12:09,301 --> 00:12:11,936
...out of the goddamn air lock,

127
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,566
like I said.

128
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:19,946
Are there any species
like this hostile organism...

129
00:12:20,046 --> 00:12:20,890
...on LV-426?

130
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,965
No. It's a rock.
No indigenous life.

131
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:29,065
Did I.Q.'s just drop sharply
while I was away?

132
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,526
Ma'am, I already said it was not indigenous.

133
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,362
It was a derelict spacecraft.
It was an alien ship.

134
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,968
It was not from there.
Do you get it?

135
00:12:37,068 --> 00:12:39,068
We homed in on its beacon.

136
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:41,911
And found something
never recorded once...

137
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,514
...in over 300 surveyed worlds.

138
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:49,970
A creature that gestates
inside a living human host.

139
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:50,378
Yes.

140
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,697
These are your words.
And has concentrated acid...

141
00:12:53,797 --> 00:12:54,382
...for blood.

142
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,733
That's right.

143
00:12:56,818 --> 00:13:00,737
Look. I can see where this is going,

144
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,266
but I'm telling you that those things exist.

145
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,039
Thank you, Officer Ripley.
That will be all.

146
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:06,519
Please. You're not listening to me.

147
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,121
Kane, the crew member-

148
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,503
Kane, who went into that ship,
said he saw...

149
00:13:11,603 --> 00:13:12,942
...thousands of eggs there.

150
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,220
Thousands.
Thank you.

151
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,070
That will be all.

152
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,197
Goddamn it,
that's not all.

153
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,850
Because if one of those things
gets down here,

154
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:20,992
then that will be all.

155
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:22,886
Then all of this- this
bullshit that you think...

156
00:13:22,986 --> 00:13:23,620
...is so important-

157
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,514
You can just kiss all of that good-bye.

158
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,590
It is the finding
of this court of inquiry that...

159
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,759
Warrant Officer E. Ripley,

160
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,903
NOC14472,

161
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,723
has acted with questionable judgment...

162
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,190
...and is unfit to hold an I.C.C. license...

163
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,896
...as a commercial flight officer.

164
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:53,821
Said license is hereby
suspended indefinitely.

165
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,690
Now, no criminal charges
will be filed against you...

166
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,572
...at this time,

167
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,908
and you are released
on your own recognizance...

168
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,786
...for a six-month period
of psychometric probation,

169
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:10,390
to include monthly review
by an I.C.C. psychiatric technician.

170
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,062
These proceedings are closed.

171
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,184
That could have been better.

172
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,494
Look, I think the- Ripley?

173
00:14:30,576 --> 00:14:31,688
Van Leuwen.

174
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:35,040
Why don't you just check out LV-426?

175
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,929
Because I don't have to.
There have been people there...

176
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:38,903
...for over 20 years,

177
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,817
and they never complained
about any hostile organism.

178
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:43,658
What do you mean? What people?

179
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:46,885
Terraformers.
Planet engineers.

180
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,384
They go in, set up these
big atmosphere processors...

181
00:14:49,484 --> 00:14:50,707
...to make the air breathable.

182
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,058
Takes decades.

183
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,378
It's what we call a Shake 'N Bake colony.

184
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:59,106
How many are there?
How many colonists?

185
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,372
I don't know- 60, maybe 70 families.

186
00:15:02,472 --> 00:15:04,472
Do you mind?

187
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,365
Families.

188
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,619
Jesus.

189
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,687
[ Woman On P.A.,

190
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,081
I'll be down in maintenance, okay?

191
00:16:30,181 --> 00:16:30,306
Al.

192
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,406
What?
Hey, Al.

193
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,659
What?
Remember you sent...

194
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,602
...some wildcatters...

195
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,388
...out to the middle of nowhere last week,

196
00:16:36,488 --> 00:16:37,522
out past the Ilium Range?

197
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,808
Yeah, what?
- One of them's on the horn,

198
00:16:39,908 --> 00:16:41,484
a mom-and-pop survey team.

199
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,304
He says he's onto something.
He wants to know if...

200
00:16:43,404 --> 00:16:44,320
...his claim will be honoured.

201
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,489
Why wouldn't his claim be honoured?

202
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,680
Well, because you sent them to that
particular middle-of-nowhere...

203
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,659
...on company orders, maybe.

204
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,748
I don't know.
Christ. Some honch in...

205
00:16:51,848 --> 00:16:53,246
...a cushy office on Earth...

206
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,456
...says, Go look at a grid reference.

207
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,619
We look.
They don't say why,

208
00:16:57,719 --> 00:16:58,793
and I don't ask.

209
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,753
I don't ask, because it takes
two weeks to get an answer out here,

210
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:02,964
and the answer is always-

211
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,064
Don't ask.

212
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,176
So what do l tell this guy?

213
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,160
Tell him as far as I'm concerned, if he...

214
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,513
...finds something, it is his.

215
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,613
Lydecker?
What?

216
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,184
You kids know you're not
supposed to be on this level.

217
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,619
Go on.
Get outta here.

218
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,008
Do too. You go in places we can't fit.

219
00:17:52,108 --> 00:17:54,488
So? That's why I'm the best.

220
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,670
Knock it off. I catch either
of you playing in the air ducts...

221
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,145
...again, l'll tan your hides.

222
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,496
Mom, all the kids play-

223
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,726
Wait a minute.
Annie, come and have...

224
00:18:04,732 --> 00:18:07,027
...a look at this, will ya?

225
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:17,946
Folks, we have scored big this time.

226
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,813
What is it, Dad?

227
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:33,361
I'm not sure.

228
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,733
Let's see if we can't get a
closer look at this thing, maybe...

229
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,266
...through that crack there on the side.

230
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:41,338
Shouldn't we call in?
- Let's wait till we know...

231
00:18:41,438 --> 00:18:43,563
...what to call it in as.

232
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,584
That's about as close as we can get.

233
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,754
Should we take a look inside?

234
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,265
You two stay inside.
I mean it.

235
00:19:08,365 --> 00:19:09,590
We'll be right back.

236
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,733
Okay.
Bye.

237
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,560
Huh?

238
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,707
Timmy, they've been gone a long time.

239
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,176
It'll be okay, Newt.
Dad knows what he's doing.

240
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:41,072
Mayday, Mayday. This is Alpha Kilo
Two Four Niner calling.

241
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:44,117
This is Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner.

242
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,133
Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner calling.

243
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,400
Hiya, Ripley.
This is Lieutenant Gorman...

244
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,627
...of the Colonial Marine Corps-

245
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,962
Ripley,
we have to talk.

246
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:41,787
We've lost contact
with the colony on LV-426.

247
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,433
I don't believe this.

248
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,789
You guys throw me at the wolves,
and now you want me...

249
00:21:53,889 --> 00:21:55,089
...to go back out there?

250
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,774
Forget it.
It's not my problem.

251
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,647
Can I finish?
No.

252
00:21:59,747 --> 00:22:01,747
There's no way.

253
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,246
Ripley, you wouldn't be going in...

254
00:22:04,346 --> 00:22:04,974
...with the troops.

255
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,454
I can guarantee your safety.

256
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,979
These Colonial Marines
are very tough hombres.

257
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,194
They're packing state-of-the-art...

258
00:22:12,294 --> 00:22:12,940
...firepower.

259
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,484
There's nothing they can't handle.

260
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,903
Lieutenant, am I right?
- That's true.

261
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,747
We've been trained to deal with situations...

262
00:22:19,847 --> 00:22:20,156
...like this.

263
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:23,925
Then you don't need me.
I'm not a soldier.

264
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,579
Yeah, but we don't know exactly
what's going on out there.

265
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,867
It may just be a downed transmitter,

266
00:22:28,967 --> 00:22:29,290
okay?

267
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,518
But if it's not,
I would like you there...

268
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:33,836
...as an adviser,

269
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,979
and that's all.

270
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,642
What's your interest in all this?

271
00:22:39,742 --> 00:22:40,801
Why are you going?

272
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,945
Corporation cofinanced that colony,

273
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,515
along with Colonial Administration.

274
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,405
We're getting into a lot of terraforming now.

275
00:22:48,505 --> 00:22:49,435
Building Better Worlds-

276
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,021
Yeah, yeah.
I saw the commercial.

277
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,188
Look, I don't have time for this. I've got...

278
00:22:54,288 --> 00:22:55,024
...to get to work.

279
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:58,235
Oh, right. I heard you're
working the cargo docks.

280
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,336
That's right.

281
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:02,597
Running loaders and forklifts,
that sort of thing?

282
00:23:02,697 --> 00:23:03,115
Yeah. So?

283
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,369
Nothing. I think it's great
that you're keeping busy.

284
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:08,954
And I know it's the only
thing that you could get.

285
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,604
There's nothing wrong with it.

286
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,715
What would you say if I told you I could...

287
00:23:15,815 --> 00:23:16,587
...get you reinstated...

288
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,687
...as a flight officer?

289
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:22,747
The company's already agreed
to pick up your contract.

290
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:23,219
If I go.

291
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,279
Yeah, if you go.

292
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,516
Come on.
That's a second chance, kiddo.

293
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:30,133
I think, personally,
for you, it would be...

294
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:31,352
...the best thing in the world...

295
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,184
...to get out there and face this thing,

296
00:23:33,284 --> 00:23:34,313
get back on the horse.

297
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,728
Spare me, Burke.
I've had my psych evaluation...

298
00:23:36,828 --> 00:23:37,358
...this month.

299
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,366
Yeah, I know. I've read it. You wake
up every night. Your sheets...

300
00:23:40,466 --> 00:23:41,529
...are soaking with sweat-

301
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,880
I said no,
and I mean it.

302
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,537
Now, please leave.
I am not going back.

303
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:52,957
And I am- I would not be
any good to you if I did.

304
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:56,142
Okay. Shh.

305
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,791
Would you do me a favour?

306
00:23:59,891 --> 00:24:01,891
Just think about it.

307
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,194
Thanks for the coffee.

308
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,715
Oh.

309
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,263
Hello.

310
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:18,975
Ripley.

311
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,141
You okay?
Just tell me...

312
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:22,630
...one thing, Burke.

313
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,105
You're going out there
to destroy them, right?

314
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:31,029
Not to study, not to bring back,
but to wipe them out.

315
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:35,158
That's the plan.
You have my word on it.

316
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,703
All right. I'm in.

317
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,289
I think that-

318
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:51,408
And you,
you little shithead,

319
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,344
you're staying here.

320
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,230
Mmm.

321
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:30,374
They ain't payin' us enough for this, man.

322
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,886
Not enough to have to wake up...

323
00:28:31,986 --> 00:28:32,861
...to your face, Drake.

324
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,738
What?

325
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,073
Is that a joke?

326
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:38,257
Oh, I wish it were.

327
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:43,262
Hey, Hicks. Man, you look just like I feel.

328
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:47,209
All right, sweethearts.
What are you waiting for?

329
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,608
Breakfast in bed?
Another glorious day...

330
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:50,421
...in the corps.

331
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:54,007
A day in the Marine Corps
is like a day on the farm-...

332
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:57,389
...every meal's a banquet,
every paycheck a fortune,

333
00:28:57,489 --> 00:28:59,096
every formation a parade.

334
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:00,848
I love the corps.
Christ.

335
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:02,808
Man, this floor is freezing.

336
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,475
What do you want me to do?
Fetch your slippers for ya?

337
00:29:05,575 --> 00:29:07,062
Gee, would you, sir? I'd like that.

338
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,414
Look into my eye.
Fall in, people.

339
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,750
Come on. Let's go.

340
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,834
I hate this job.

341
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,366
Crowe, Wierzbowski.
Come on. On your feet.

342
00:29:16,466 --> 00:29:17,573
We got some slack coming, right?

343
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,577
You had three weeks on your back, Frost.

344
00:29:19,677 --> 00:29:20,534
What do you want?

345
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:22,995
I'm talking about breathing,
not this frozen shit.

346
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,388
Yeah, Top. How 'bout it?

347
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:32,767
All right. First assembly's
in 15, people. Shag it.

348
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,566
Hey, mira.
Who's Snow White?

349
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:40,095
She's supposed to be
some kind of consultant.

350
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,431
Apparently,
she saw an alien once.

351
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:45,559
Whoopee-fuckin'-do.
Hey, I'm impressed.

352
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,702
iQue bonita.

353
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,588
Hey, Vasquez.
Have you ever been...

354
00:29:52,655 --> 00:29:54,151
...mistaken for a man?

355
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:56,294
No. Have you?

356
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,796
Ha, ha.
Oh, Vasquez.

357
00:29:58,896 --> 00:30:01,215
You're just too bad.

358
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,925
Uhh.

359
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,604
Hey, Top,
what's the op?

360
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,798
It's a rescue mission.
You'll love it.

361
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,779
There's some juicy
colonists' daughters we have...

362
00:30:19,879 --> 00:30:21,595
...to rescue from their virginity.

363
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,863
Dumb-ass colonists.

364
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,245
What's this crap supposed to be?

365
00:30:29,345 --> 00:30:30,103
Vasquez.

366
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,845
Corn bread, I think.
It's good for you, boy.

367
00:30:32,945 --> 00:30:33,273
Eat it.

368
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,172
Hey, sure wouldn't mind
getting some more...

369
00:30:35,272 --> 00:30:36,360
...of that Arcturian poontang.

370
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,762
Remember that time?
- Yeah. Except the one...

371
00:30:39,862 --> 00:30:41,573
...that you had was male.

372
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,298
Doesn't matter when it's Arcturian.

373
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,292
Hey, Bishop, man.
Do the thing with the knife.

374
00:30:46,392 --> 00:30:46,828
Oh, please.

375
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,347
Oh, come on. Yeah.

376
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,431
All right. Yeah.

377
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:54,004
I don't want to see that, man.
- Come on, man.

378
00:30:54,104 --> 00:30:55,045
All right. All right.

379
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:58,131
Hey, what are you doing, man?
What are you doing?

380
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,632
Come on.
Quit messing around, Drake.

381
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:00,342
Hudson, shut up.

382
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:03,077
Bishop, hey, man.
Do it, Bishop.

383
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,324
Hey. Not me, man.
Quit messing around.

384
00:31:05,424 --> 00:31:06,682
Yeah, you. Don't move.

385
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:09,075
Trust me.

386
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,369
Aah.

387
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:23,740
All right. Knock it off,
knock it off.

388
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,841
Thank you.

389
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,419
There you go,
short shit.

390
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,289
Enjoy your meal.

391
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:33,140
That wasn't funny, man.

392
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:38,810
Lieutenant Gorman?
Mr. Burke?

393
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:39,798
Yeah, thanks.

394
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:44,234
Looks like the new lieutenant's
too good to eat with...

395
00:31:44,334 --> 00:31:46,459
...the rest of us grunts.

396
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:50,058
Boy's definitely got a corncob up his ass.

397
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,452
Thought you never miss, Bishop.

398
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,081
You never said anything about
an android being on board.

399
00:31:59,181 --> 00:31:59,526
Why not?

400
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:03,671
It never- never occurred to me.

401
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,746
It's just common practice.
We always have...

402
00:32:05,846 --> 00:32:06,825
...a synthetic on board.

403
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,369
I prefer the term artificial person myself.

404
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,330
Right.

405
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,098
Is there a problem?
I'm sorry.

406
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,084
I don't know why I didn't even-

407
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,736
Ripley's last trip out,
the syn- the artificial person...

408
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:19,588
...malfunctioned.

409
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,574
Malfunctioned?
- There were problems and...

410
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,551
...a few deaths were involved.

411
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,862
I'm shocked.
Was it an older model?

412
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,614
The Hyperdyne Systems 1 20-A2.

413
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,620
That explains it then.
The A2s always were...

414
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,268
...a bit twitchy.

415
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,063
That could never happen now
with our behavioural inhibitors.

416
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:39,183
It is impossible for me to harm,
or by omission of action, allow...

417
00:32:39,283 --> 00:32:40,734
...to be harmed, a human being.

418
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:45,045
You sure you don't want some?

419
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:49,975
You just stay away from me,
Bishop. You got that straight?

420
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:54,250
Guess she don't like the corn bread, either.

421
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:10,060
Squad, ten-hut.
Officer on deck.

422
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,306
As you were.

423
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,241
Quickly, quickly.
Settle down.

424
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:17,328
All right.
Listen up.

425
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:20,691
Morning, marines. l'm sorry we
didn't have time to brief you...

426
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,484
...people before we left Gateway-

427
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:25,044
Sir?
What is it, Hicks?

428
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:28,214
Hudson, sir.
He's Hicks.

429
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:31,217
What's the question?

430
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:33,643
Is this gonna be a stand-up fight, sir,

431
00:33:33,743 --> 00:33:35,080
or another bug hunt?

432
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,012
All we know is that there's still no contact...

433
00:33:38,112 --> 00:33:39,251
...with the colony...

434
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:42,212
...and that a xenomorph may be involved.

435
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:43,951
Excuse me, sir.
A what?

436
00:33:44,051 --> 00:33:45,006
A xenomorph.

437
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,358
It's a bug hunt.

438
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:51,404
What exactly are we dealing with here?

439
00:33:51,504 --> 00:33:52,139
Ripley.

440
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,657
I'll tell you what I know.

441
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,159
We set down on LV-426.

442
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:59,788
One of our crew members was
brought back on board with...

443
00:33:59,888 --> 00:34:01,231
...something attached to his face,

444
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:03,833
some kind of parasite.

445
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:06,236
We tried to get it off.
It wouldn't come off.

446
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:09,239
Later, it seemed to come off
by itselfand die.

447
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,882
Kane seemed fine.

448
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:14,077
We were all having dinner,
and, um,

449
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,934
it must have laid something
inside his throat,

450
00:34:17,034 --> 00:34:18,331
some sort of embryo.

451
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:22,393
He started- Um, he- Look, man.

452
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:25,766
I only need to know one thing-...

453
00:34:25,866 --> 00:34:27,549
...where they are.

454
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,043
Yo, Vasquez.
Kick ass.

455
00:34:29,143 --> 00:34:30,385
Anytime, anywhere.

456
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,725
Right, right. Somebody said
alien. She thought they said...

457
00:34:33,825 --> 00:34:35,348
...illegal alien and signed up.

458
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,759
Fuck you, man.
Anytime,

459
00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:37,392
anywhere.

460
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,119
Are you finished?

461
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:48,012
I hope you're right.
I really do.

462
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:53,315
Yeah, okay, right.
Thank you, Ripley.

463
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:55,172
We also have Ripley's report on disk.

464
00:34:55,272 --> 00:34:56,328
I suggest you study it.

465
00:34:56,428 --> 00:35:00,088
Because just one of those things
managed to wipe out my entire crew...

466
00:35:00,188 --> 00:35:01,291
...in less than 24 hours.

467
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:03,081
And if the colonists have found that ship,

468
00:35:03,181 --> 00:35:04,127
then there's no telling...

469
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,879
...how many of them have been exposed.

470
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:08,397
Do you understand?

471
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,386
Anyway, we have it on disk,
so you better look at it.

472
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,155
Any questions?

473
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,616
What is it, Private?

474
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,686
How do I get out of this chickenshit outfit?

475
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,166
You secure that shit,
Hudson.

476
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,292
All right.

477
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,211
Now listen up.

478
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,699
I want this thing to go smooth...

479
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,343
...and by the numbers.

480
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:40,202
I want D.C.S.
and tactical database...

481
00:35:40,233 --> 00:35:41,873
...assimilation by 0830.

482
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,960
Ordinance loading, weapons strip
and drop-ship prep details...

483
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,532
...will have seven hours.

484
00:35:46,632 --> 00:35:47,420
Oh, come on.

485
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,688
Now, move it,
people.

486
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,460
All right, sweethearts.
You heard the man,

487
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,467
and you know the drill.

488
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,825
Assholes and elbows.
Hudson, come here.

489
00:35:55,925 --> 00:35:57,925
Come here.

490
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,461
I don't care if you are short, Hudson.

491
00:36:13,561 --> 00:36:13,989
Get it done.

492
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:15,759
Hey, Sarge.
You'll get lip cancer...

493
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:16,658
...smoking those.

494
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:19,508
Corporal, I want this loading lock sealed.

495
00:36:19,608 --> 00:36:19,911
Now.

496
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,905
How many more you got,
Spunkmeyer?

497
00:36:22,005 --> 00:36:22,414
Last one.

498
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,556
Good. Take it away.

499
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:44,076
Clear behind.

500
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,861
Did you check number three?
Let me see that.

501
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,364
Hi. I feel like kind of
a fifth wheel around here.

502
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:56,865
Is there anything I can do?

503
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,440
I don't know.
Is there anything...

504
00:36:59,473 --> 00:37:01,473
...you can do?

505
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,553
Well, I can drive that loader.

506
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:08,308
I have a Class 2 rating.

507
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,477
Be my guest.

508
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:59,943
Where you want it?

509
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:03,489
Bay 12, please.

510
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,727
All right,
sweethearts. We're a team, and...

511
00:39:01,827 --> 00:39:03,283
...there's nothing to worry about.

512
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,457
We come here,
and we gonna conquer,

513
00:39:05,557 --> 00:39:06,911
and we gonna kick some.

514
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,477
Is that understood? That's what
we gonna do, sweethearts.

515
00:39:09,577 --> 00:39:09,873
Yes, sir.

516
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:11,972
We are going to go and get some.

517
00:39:12,072 --> 00:39:12,292
Hey.

518
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:15,170
All right, people.
On the ready line.

519
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,270
Are you lean?
Are you mean?

520
00:39:17,286 --> 00:39:18,048
Yeah. Yeah.

521
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:19,775
What are you?
What are you?

522
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:20,759
Lean and mean.

523
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:23,034
Hudson.
Get on the ready line,

524
00:39:23,122 --> 00:39:23,636
marine.

525
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:26,681
Get some today.
Get on the ready line.

526
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:27,831
Yo.
Move it out.

527
00:39:27,931 --> 00:39:29,684
Move it out, goddamn it.

528
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:33,354
Get hot. One, two, three.
Get out, get out, get out.

529
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,748
Move it out, move it out,
move it out. Move it out,

530
00:39:35,848 --> 00:39:36,983
move it out, move it out.

531
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,668
[ Barking Orders,

532
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:43,380
Absolutely badasses.

533
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,867
Let's pack 'em in.
Get in there.

534
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,967
All right. Move it.

535
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,705
Let's go, let's go.
One, two, three,

536
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:54,266
four, five, six.

537
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,817
All right.
I want combat seating.

538
00:39:56,917 --> 00:39:58,713
You know your places.

539
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,091
Get those weapons stowed.
Let's go.

540
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:04,526
Come on.
Settle down, people.

541
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:06,695
Lock 'em in, Hudson.

542
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:10,199
Ready to get it on?
You know it.

543
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:12,951
Okay, Bishop,
let's go.

544
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:15,204
Roger.

545
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:19,708
I'm ready, man.

546
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:23,337
Ready to get it on.
Go.

547
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:32,227
Stand by. Cross-locking now.
Prelaunch autocycle engaged.

548
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:38,727
Primary couplers released.
Hit the internals.

549
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,633
Shit, man.
Confirm cross-lock...

550
00:40:51,733 --> 00:40:52,976
...and drop stations secured.

551
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:57,204
Affirmative.
All drop stations secured.

552
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,418
Stand by. Ten seconds.

553
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:09,122
Stand by to initiate release sequencer...

554
00:41:09,157 --> 00:41:10,076
...on my mark.

555
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:13,396
Five, four, three,
- We're on an express elevator...

556
00:41:13,496 --> 00:41:14,831
...to hell, going down.

557
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:17,891
two, one, mark.

558
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,436
Woo-hoo.

559
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:38,078
Switch to D.C.S. ranging.
240, nominal to profile.

560
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,872
We're in the pipe,
five by five.

561
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,745
We're picking up some hull ionization.

562
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:56,305
Got it.
Rough air ahead.

563
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:58,640
We're in for some chop.

564
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,850
How many drops is this
for you, Lieutenant?

565
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,369
Thirty-eight.

566
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,454
Simulated.

567
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,623
How many combat drops?

568
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:27,753
Uh, two...
including this one.

569
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:31,173
Shit.
- Oh, man.

570
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:48,065
Range 014.
Turning on final.

571
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,899
And I'm telling you,
I got a bad feeling...

572
00:42:54,999 --> 00:42:55,807
...about this drop.

573
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,971
You always say that,
Frost. You always say, I got...

574
00:42:58,071 --> 00:42:59,310
...a bad feeling about this drop.

575
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,854
Okay, okay.
When we get back without you,

576
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,956
I'll call your folks.

577
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:11,338
All right.
Let's see what we can see.

578
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:14,883
Everybody online.
Looking good.

579
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,387
Drake, check your camera.
There seems to be...

580
00:43:19,487 --> 00:43:20,290
...a malfunction.

581
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:23,683
That's better.
Pan it around a bit.

582
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,853
Good.
- I'm ready, man. Check it out.

583
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:29,229
I am the ultimate badass.
Yeah.

584
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:30,049
That's right.

585
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:34,080
State-of-the-badass art.
You do not want to fuck with me.

586
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,555
Who here's runnin'?

587
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:38,532
Check it out.

588
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,494
Hey, Ripley,
don't worry.

589
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,739
Me and my squad of ultimate badasses...

590
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:45,690
...will protect you.

591
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,790
Hey.
That's right.

592
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,960
Check it out.

593
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:53,573
Independently targeting
particle-beam phalanx.

594
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:57,300
Fry halfa city with this puppy.

595
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:59,746
We got tactical smart missiles,

596
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:02,248
phase-plasma pulse rifles,
R.P.G.'s.

597
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:05,239
We got sonic,
electronic ball breakers.

598
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:05,793
Whoo.

599
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:09,213
We got nukes, we got knives,
sharp sticks-

600
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,313
Knock it off, Hudson.
All right, gear up.

601
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:16,111
Two minutes, people.
Get hot.

602
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,195
Somebody wake up Hicks.

603
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:33,837
Coming around for a 709er.

604
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:35,383
Terminal guidance locked in.

605
00:44:35,483 --> 00:44:36,824
Where's the damn beacon?

606
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,426
Oh, I see it.

607
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,000
That's the atmosphere processor?

608
00:44:48,029 --> 00:44:48,878
Yep, that's it.

609
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:50,837
Remarkable piece of machinery.

610
00:44:50,937 --> 00:44:52,256
Completely automated.

611
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,906
You know,
we manufacture those,

612
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
by the way.

613
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,425
Okay, Ferro.
Take us in low over...

614
00:45:07,468 --> 00:45:09,763
...the main colony complex.

615
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,528
Storm shutters are sealed.

616
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:17,532
There's no visible activity.
All right. Hold at 40.

617
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:19,883
Roger.
Give me a slow circle...

618
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:21,983
...of the complex.

619
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:32,687
Structure seems intact.
They still have power.

620
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:35,257
Okay, Ferro.
Set down on...

621
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:36,968
...the landing grid.

622
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,705
Immediate dust off on my clear,

623
00:45:39,805 --> 00:45:41,805
then stay on station.

624
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,336
Down and clear.

625
00:45:57,505 --> 00:46:00,140
Ten seconds, people.
Look sharp.

626
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:07,053
All right. I want a nice,
clean dispersal this time.

627
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,808
Let's go.
Move it out.

628
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,893
Head 'em up.

629
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,741
First squad up on line.
Hicks, get yours in accord...

630
00:46:35,841 --> 00:46:36,986
...and watch the rear.

631
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:40,714
Vasquez, take point.
Let's move.

632
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:50,097
Move up.

633
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:55,020
Hudson, run a bypass.

634
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:03,346
Second squad, move up.
Flanking positions.

635
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:06,156
Second squad on line.

636
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:36,269
You set?

637
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:41,316
Go on.

638
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:11,264
Second team, move inside.
Hicks, take the upper level.

639
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:42,722
Sir, you copying this? Looks
like hits from small-arms fire.

640
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:45,880
Uh, we got some explosives damage.

641
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:48,200
It's probably seismic survey charges.

642
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:52,095
Are you reading this?
Keep it tight, people.

643
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,609
All right. Hicks, Hudson,
use your motion trackers.

644
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:30,467
Nothing.
Not a goddamn thing.

645
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:38,224
Quarter and search by twos.

646
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,614
Okay. Dietrich,
Frost, you're up.

647
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:41,787
It's right in there.

648
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:54,827
Now.
Now.

649
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:59,722
Haah. Uh-
- Good one, Hudson.

650
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:03,435
Uh, sir, uh, we have
a negative situation here.

651
00:51:03,535 --> 00:51:05,535
Uh, movin' on, sir

652
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:16,948
Wait. Wait,
tell him to-

653
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:21,661
Hicks, back up.
Pan right.

654
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:28,418
There.
- You seeing this all right?

655
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:31,729
Looks melted.
Somebody must have bagged...

656
00:51:31,829 --> 00:51:34,033
...one of Ripley's bad guys here.

657
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:36,133
Acid for blood.

658
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:39,762
If you like that,
you're gonna love this.

659
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,637
Quit screwing around.

660
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:56,472
Second squad,
what's your status?

661
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:59,683
Uh, we just finished our sweep.
Nobody's home.

662
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:02,368
Roger.
Sir, this place is dead.

663
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:05,064
Whatever happened here,
I think we missed it.

664
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:07,508
All right. The area's
secured. Let's go in and see...

665
00:52:07,608 --> 00:52:09,151
...what their computer can tell us.

666
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,657
Wait a minute.
It's not secure.

667
00:52:10,757 --> 00:52:12,071
The area's secured, Ripley.

668
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:14,806
First team,
head for operations.

669
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,691
Hudson, see if you can
get their C.P.U. on line.

670
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,327
Affirmative.

671
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:21,418
Hicks, meet me at
the south lock. We're coming in.

672
00:52:21,518 --> 00:52:21,872
Roger.

673
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:25,266
He's comin' in.
I feel safer already.

674
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:27,393
Pendejo jerk-off.

675
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:51,417
Sir, we got the C.P.U. on line.
No problem.

676
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:54,212
Good. Stand by in Operations.

677
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:57,256
Okay, let's go.

678
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,611
Are you all right?

679
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:22,489
Yes.

680
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:42,760
Sir, they sealed off this wing at both ends,

681
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:44,918
welded the doors and
blocked off the stairs...

682
00:53:45,018 --> 00:53:46,081
...with heavy equipment.

683
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:48,206
Mm-hmm.
But it looks like...

684
00:53:48,256 --> 00:53:50,210
...the barricade didn't hold.

685
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,437
Any bodies?
No, sir.

686
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:54,521
Last stand.

687
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:56,998
Must have been a hell of a fight.

688
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,694
Yeah, looks that way.

689
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,724
All right, Drake, this way.

690
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:07,388
We should be able
to cut through the medlab...

691
00:54:07,488 --> 00:54:09,488
...to Operations.

692
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:00,629
Lieutenant.

693
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:04,383
Gorman.

694
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:23,741
Are those the same ones that-

695
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:38,251
Careful, Burke.

696
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:51,764
Looks like love at first sight to me.

697
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,183
Oh, he likes you, Burke.

698
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:56,988
Two are alive.
The rest are dead.

699
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:01,717
Surgically removed
before embryo implantation.

700
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:06,529
Subject Marachek, John J.,
died during the procedure.

701
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:09,016
They killed him taking it off.

702
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:13,286
Yo, Hicks.

703
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,920
I think we got something here.

704
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:22,669
Behind us.
One of us?

705
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:27,409
Apone, where are your people?
Anybody in D block?

706
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:31,419
Ah, that's a negative.
We're all in Operations.

707
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,391
Talk to me,
Frosty.

708
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,515
Let's keep moving, baby.

709
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:57,871
It's moving.
Which way?

710
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,312
It's coming straight for us.

711
00:57:00,412 --> 00:57:02,412
Straight up.

712
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:40,997
Fuck.
Hold up.

713
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,542
Ripley.

714
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:06,649
Hey. Shh.
It's all right.

715
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:07,777
It's all right.
Come on.

716
00:58:07,877 --> 00:58:09,011
Just grab her, Corporal.

717
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:12,180
Don't be afraid. Come on.
We won't hurt you.

718
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,558
Shh. It's all right.
It's okay.

719
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:16,826
Come on out. Come on.

720
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,994
Easy. Easy.
- I got her.

721
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:21,079
Ow. Damn.

722
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:22,903
Watch her.
She's under the grille.

723
00:58:23,003 --> 00:58:23,859
Don't let her go.

724
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:26,313
Frost, get your light up here.

725
00:58:26,413 --> 00:58:28,413
Where'd she go?

726
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:33,968
Shine the light.
Here. Here.

727
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:35,787
Here. Here.
There she is.

728
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:38,498
Keep back. Keep back.
Don't scare her.

729
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:41,573
Grab her, man.
We're gonna lose her.

730
00:58:41,623 --> 00:58:43,462
Damn it.

731
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:45,562
Kick it out.

732
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:49,692
Wait.

733
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:18,304
It's okay.
It's all right.

734
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:23,100
Don't be afraid.

735
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:25,227
See?

736
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:27,353
Wait.
No, you don't.

737
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,355
It's okay.
You're gonna...

738
00:59:29,408 --> 00:59:30,801
...be all right now.

739
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:32,985
Shh.

740
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:37,239
Easy. Easy.
It's gonna be okay.

741
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:39,810
It's all right.
You're gonna be okay.

742
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:41,952
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

743
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:45,122
Easy. Easy.

744
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:23,667
What's her name again?
Rebecca.

745
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:27,665
Now think, Rebecca.
Concentrate.

746
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:30,584
Just start at the beginning.

747
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:33,712
Where are your parents?

748
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,991
Now, look, Rebecca,
you have to try and help-

749
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:39,236
Gorman, give it a rest,
why don't you?

750
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:43,806
Total brain lock.

751
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,890
Physically, she's okay.

752
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,943
Borderline malnutrition,
but I don't think there's...

753
01:00:48,043 --> 01:00:49,087
...any permanent damage.

754
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:51,822
Come on.
We're wasting our time.

755
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:03,492
Try this.

756
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:05,957
It's a little hot chocolate.

757
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:09,832
There you go.

758
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,126
Whoop.

759
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,210
That good, huh?

760
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:22,011
Uh-oh. I made a clean spot here.

761
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:24,964
Now I've done it.
Guess l'll have to...

762
01:01:25,064 --> 01:01:27,064
...do the whole thing.

763
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:38,510
Hard to believe there's a little girl...

764
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:40,610
...under all this.

765
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:43,157
And a pretty one too.

766
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:49,788
You don't talk much,
do you?

767
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:00,798
Smoking or non-smoking?

768
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:02,744
Just tell me what
you're scanning for, Private.

769
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:04,844
P.D.T.s.
What?

770
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:06,748
Personal data transmitters.

771
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,376
Every colonist had one
surgically implanted.

772
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:11,152
If they're within 20 klicks,

773
01:02:11,252 --> 01:02:12,629
we'll read it out here.

774
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,897
So far, zippo.

775
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:17,884
I don't know how you
managed to stay alive,

776
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:20,874
but you're one brave kid, Rebecca.

777
01:02:22,364 --> 01:02:24,364
N-Newt.

778
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:29,828
What'd you say?
- Newt.

779
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:32,122
My name's Newt.

780
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:37,336
Nobody calls me Rebecca
except my brother.

781
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:41,298
Newt?
I like that.

782
01:02:41,383 --> 01:02:45,177
I'm Ripley.
It's nice to meet you.

783
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:50,265
And who is this, hmm?

784
01:02:50,392 --> 01:02:54,103
Casey.
Hello, Casey.

785
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:57,187
What about your brother?
What's his name?

786
01:02:57,232 --> 01:02:59,274
Timmy.

787
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:03,821
Is Timmy around here too?
Maybe hiding like you were?

788
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:08,866
Any sisters?

789
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,455
Mom and dad?

790
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:21,463
Newt, look at me.
Where are they?

791
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:24,693
They're dead, all right?
Can I go now?

792
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:30,180
I'm sorry, Newt.

793
01:03:30,265 --> 01:03:33,920
Don't you think you'd
be safer here with us?

794
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:38,757
These people are here to protect you.

795
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:40,857
They're soldiers.

796
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,736
It won't make any difference.

797
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:59,251
Need anything else?

798
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:05,281
Hello, Bishop. Do you need anything else?

799
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:08,677
No.

800
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:12,874
That's a nice pet you got there, Bishop.

801
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:15,893
Magnificent, isn't it?

802
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:20,981
Yo. Stop your grinnin'
and drop your linen. Found 'em.

803
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:23,650
They alive?
Unknown,

804
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:25,637
but it looks like all of them.

805
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:29,907
Over at the processing station,
Sublevel 3,

806
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:32,541
under the main cooling towers.

807
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:36,272
Looks like a goddamn town meeting.

808
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:38,372
Let's saddle up, Apone.

809
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:40,667
Aye, sir.

810
01:04:40,752 --> 01:04:42,726
All right. Let's go, people.
They ain't payin' us...

811
01:04:42,826 --> 01:04:43,321
...by the hour.

812
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:45,421
Let's go.
Head 'em out.

813
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:47,760
Okay, Frost,
you're driving.

814
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:02,731
It's okay. Don't worry.
It'll be okay.

815
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:45,403
I want a straight V deployment,

816
01:05:45,503 --> 01:05:47,260
second team on left flank.

817
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:51,405
Advance on axial 664.
Tracker on line.

818
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:54,601
Set the V gain to filter R.F. ambient.

819
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:58,676
Hudson, tracker on line.
Left and right, little buddy.

820
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:04,194
Forty meters in, bearing 221,
there should be a stairwell.

821
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:06,294
Check. Got it.

822
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:09,714
You want Sublevel 3.

823
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:14,079
Let's go, people.
Hudson, you got the point.

824
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:16,555
Hicks, watch our tails.

825
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,808
Nice and easy.
Check those corners.

826
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:22,144
Check those corners.

827
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,030
Watch your spacing.
All right.

828
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:28,134
You heard the man.

829
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,234
Don't bunch up.
Stay loose.

830
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:32,972
Uh, your transmission's
showing a lot of breakup.

831
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:35,847
Probably getting some interference...

832
01:06:35,859 --> 01:06:37,268
...from the structure.

833
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:39,494
Use those lights.

834
01:06:39,579 --> 01:06:43,957
Next one down,
and proceed on a 216.

835
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:46,210
Uh, roger. That's a 216.

836
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:51,407
I'm not making that out
too well. What is it, Hudson?

837
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:54,468
You tell me, man.
I only work here.

838
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:11,652
What is that?

839
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:13,946
I don't know.

840
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:17,950
Proceed inside.

841
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:36,683
Watch your fire and check your targets.

842
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:40,374
Remember we're looking for civvies in here.

843
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:50,856
Easy.

844
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:55,023
Tighten it up, Frost.
We're getting a little thin.

845
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:57,406
Nice and easy.

846
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:01,603
Looks like some sort of secreted resin.

847
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:05,497
Yeah, but secreted from what?

848
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:08,250
Nobody touch nothing.

849
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:11,295
Busy little creatures, huh?

850
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:13,630
Hot as hell in here.

851
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:15,617
Yeah, man,
but it's a dry heat.

852
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:17,717
Knock it off, Hudson.

853
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:28,922
Lieutenant, what do those pulse rifles fire?

854
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:31,382
Ten millimetre explosive-tip caseless.

855
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:33,426
Standard light armor-piercing round.

856
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:34,885
Why?
Well, look where...

857
01:08:34,985 --> 01:08:35,762
...your team is.

858
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:37,899
They're right under the primary...

859
01:08:37,999 --> 01:08:39,098
...heat exchangers.

860
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:41,199
So?

861
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:43,937
So if they fire their weapons
in there, won't they rupture...

862
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:44,979
...the cooling system?

863
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:48,155
Ho, ho, ho. Yeah.
She's absolutely right.

864
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,317
So? So what?

865
01:08:49,417 --> 01:08:53,613
Look. This whole station is
basically a big fusion reactor.

866
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:56,089
Right?

867
01:08:56,174 --> 01:08:59,303
So you're talking about
a thermonuclear explosion,

868
01:08:59,403 --> 01:09:00,828
and adios, muchachos.

869
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:03,555
Oh, great. Wonderful.

870
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:06,433
Shit.

871
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:12,230
Look.
Uh... Apone.

872
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:16,985
Look. We can't have any firing in there.

873
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:20,807
I, uh, I want you to collect
magazines from everybody.

874
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:23,406
Is he fuckin' crazy?
- What the hell are we supposed...

875
01:09:23,506 --> 01:09:24,936
...to use, man, harsh language?

876
01:09:25,036 --> 01:09:27,441
Flame units only.
I want rifles slung.

877
01:09:27,541 --> 01:09:27,855
Sir, I-

878
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:31,100
Just do it, Sergeant.
And no grenades.

879
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:35,988
All right, sweethearts.
You heard the man. Pull 'em out.

880
01:09:36,088 --> 01:09:37,615
Come on. Let's have 'em.

881
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:40,435
Come on, Vasquez.
Clear and lock.

882
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:45,597
Damn.

883
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:47,792
You too. Give it up, Ski.
Come on. Let's go.

884
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:50,852
Crowe, I want it now.
Give it up.

885
01:09:50,937 --> 01:09:52,937
Right on, Vas.

886
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:56,050
Let's go, marine.
Give it up.

887
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,261
Frost, you got the duty.
Open that bag.

888
01:09:58,361 --> 01:10:01,222
Thanks a lot, Sarge.
- Hicks, cover our ass.

889
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:03,322
Head 'em out, people.

890
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:08,896
I like to keep this handy...
for close encounters.

891
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:10,996
I heard that.

892
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:21,841
Any movement?

893
01:10:21,843 --> 01:10:24,511
Nothing. Zip.

894
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,651
Holy shit.

895
01:10:52,457 --> 01:10:54,958
Newt, go sit up front.

896
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:57,544
Go on. Now.

897
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:28,935
Steady, people.
Let's finish our sweep.

898
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:32,438
We're still marines,
and we got a job to do.

899
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:36,249
Keep it moving. Easy.

900
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:09,851
Help.
- What?

901
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:11,525
Top, get over here.
We got a live one.

902
01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:12,687
You're gonna be all right.

903
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:15,956
Please... k-kill me.

904
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,901
Just stay calm.
We're gonna get you outta here.

905
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,433
It's gonna be all right.
Give me a hand.

906
01:12:20,533 --> 01:12:21,571
We gotta get her outta here.

907
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:24,031
What is it, Dietrich?
- Convulsion.

908
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:26,800
Dietrich, get back.

909
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:29,261
Get back.

910
01:12:36,394 --> 01:12:39,026
No.
- Frost, flamethrower.

911
01:12:39,126 --> 01:12:39,672
Kill it.

912
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:42,399
Get back.
Flamethrower. Move.

913
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:13,915
Movement.

914
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:18,768
What's the position?
- I can't lock in.

915
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:21,229
Talk to me, Hudson.

916
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:24,482
Multiple signals.

917
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:26,693
They're closing.

918
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:30,071
Go to infrared, people.
Look sharp.

919
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:33,476
What's happening, Apone?
Can't see anything in here.

920
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:35,786
Pull your team out,
Gorman.

921
01:13:41,334 --> 01:13:42,854
I got signals.
I got readings...

922
01:13:42,954 --> 01:13:44,070
...in front and behind.

923
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:46,364
Where, man?
I don't see shit.

924
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:48,950
He's right.
There's nothing back here.

925
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:52,402
Look, I'm telling you.
There's something moving,

926
01:13:52,502 --> 01:13:53,454
and it ain't us.

927
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:56,556
Oh, shit.
Tracker's off scale, man.

928
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:59,934
They're all around us, man. Jesus.

929
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:03,759
Maybe they don't show up on infrared at all.

930
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:15,659
Frost.

931
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:21,789
Come on.

932
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:30,783
Jesus Christ, Apone.
What is going on?

933
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:33,802
Wierzbowski and Crowe are down.

934
01:14:33,928 --> 01:14:36,733
Dietrich, Crowe.
Sound off. Frost.

935
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:39,250
Dietrich, Frost, off the board.

936
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:41,350
Frost.

937
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:45,814
Wierzbowski?

938
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:48,608
Wierzbowski?

939
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:52,404
Let's rock.

940
01:14:55,116 --> 01:14:57,156
Who's firing?
Goddamn it.

941
01:14:57,743 --> 01:14:58,978
Yeah.

942
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:01,831
I ordered to hold fire.
They're coming...

943
01:15:01,931 --> 01:15:03,107
...out of the walls.

944
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:05,029
They're coming out of the goddamn walls.

945
01:15:05,129 --> 01:15:05,568
Let's book.

946
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:07,862
On the right, man.
Uh, Apone,

947
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:10,698
I want you to lay down
a suppressing fire with the incinerators-

948
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:12,705
Vasquez, Drake,
hold your fire,

949
01:15:12,805 --> 01:15:13,534
goddamn it.

950
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:15,795
Apone, are you copying me? I want you...

951
01:15:15,895 --> 01:15:17,538
...to lay down suppressing fire...

952
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:19,579
...with the incinerators
and fall back by squads...

953
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,166
...to the A.P.C.

954
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:21,277
Over.
Say again,

955
01:15:21,377 --> 01:15:22,627
all after incinerator.

956
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:25,612
I said I want you to lay down
a suppressing fire with...

957
01:15:25,712 --> 01:15:27,423
...the incinerators and fall back...

958
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:30,158
...by squads to the A.P.C.
Over.

959
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:32,985
Hey.

960
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:36,406
Sarge. Sarge.
- Apone.

961
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:38,955
Talk to me. Apone?
Copy. Copy.

962
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:41,373
Talk to me, Apone.
He's gone.

963
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:45,358
Get them out of there.
Shut up.

964
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:47,747
Do it now. Hicks,
whoever's left, get-

965
01:15:47,847 --> 01:15:48,361
Shut up.

966
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:50,461
Just shut up.
Goddamn it.

967
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:52,742
It's coming out of the goddamn walls.

968
01:15:52,842 --> 01:15:54,867
Where's Apone? Where's Apone?

969
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:57,244
The sarge is gone.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

970
01:15:57,344 --> 01:16:01,139
Let's move it.
Let's go, marine.

971
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:04,309
Hudson? Vasquez?

972
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:07,520
Hudson, look out.
Get it.

973
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:10,648
Watch it.

974
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:12,475
Hicks.
Come on. Behind you.

975
01:16:12,575 --> 01:16:13,135
Fall back.

976
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:16,722
I told them to fall back.
Fall back, goddamn it, now.

977
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:18,724
They're cut off.
Hudson, move your ass.

978
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:20,685
Do something.
Let's go, marine.

979
01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:22,785
Fuck.

980
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:25,094
Come on.
Keep moving, baby.

981
01:16:25,194 --> 01:16:27,194
Hold on, Newt.

982
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:34,881
Ripley, what the hell are you doing?

983
01:16:40,805 --> 01:16:42,805
Turn around.

984
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:48,269
That's an order.

985
01:16:51,774 --> 01:16:55,219
Get off me, damn it.
Goddamn it, that's an order.

986
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:58,029
You had your chance,
Gorman.

987
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:11,375
Come on.

988
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:33,481
Come on. Let's move it.

989
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:35,900
Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

990
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:39,445
It's blocked, man.
We gotta go around.

991
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:44,325
Open the door. Hicks.
- Drake, we are leaving.

992
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:46,411
Get them, man.

993
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:49,873
Run for it.

994
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:53,418
Shit.

995
01:17:56,171 --> 01:17:59,424
Go. Go.
Come on, man. Come on.

996
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:11,394
Drake, come on.

997
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:16,149
No.

998
01:18:18,235 --> 01:18:21,070
Fire in the hole.
He's gone.

999
01:18:21,155 --> 01:18:23,015
Put it out. Put it out.
Go. Go.

1000
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:26,826
Come on. Put it out.
- Drake's coming, man.

1001
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:28,801
Drake.
No, he's not.

1002
01:18:28,901 --> 01:18:30,901
He's gone.

1003
01:18:31,332 --> 01:18:33,332
Forget him.
He's gone.

1004
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:41,511
They're in the goddamn door.

1005
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:47,180
Eat this.

1006
01:18:47,264 --> 01:18:50,350
Ripley.

1007
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:52,769
Go, go, go.

1008
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:57,443
It's all right.
We're clear.

1009
01:19:57,543 --> 01:19:59,945
Ripley, you've blown the transaxle.

1010
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:01,947
You're just grinding metal.

1011
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,257
Come on, ease down.

1012
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:06,384
Ease down.

1013
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:10,221
Ease down. Ease down.
Ease down.

1014
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,152
You okay?

1015
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:27,572
l'm all right.
Hudson.

1016
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:29,699
Get away from me, man.

1017
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:32,552
Lieutenant.
What happened...

1018
01:20:32,652 --> 01:20:33,812
...to Gorman?

1019
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:37,165
I don't know.
Maybe a concussion.

1020
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:39,542
But he's alive.
He's dead.

1021
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:41,695
Wake up, pendejo, and then
I'm gonna kill you.

1022
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:45,006
Back off.
Right now.

1023
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:48,468
Fuck.
Somebody get me...

1024
01:20:48,568 --> 01:20:49,620
...a first aid kit.

1025
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,847
Hey. Hey, look.

1026
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:56,210
The sarge and Dietrich aren't dead, man.

1027
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:58,295
Their signs are real low,
but they ain't dead.

1028
01:20:58,395 --> 01:21:00,164
Then we go back in there and get them.

1029
01:21:00,264 --> 01:21:00,673
Fuck that.

1030
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:03,173
We don't leave our people behind

1031
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,133
