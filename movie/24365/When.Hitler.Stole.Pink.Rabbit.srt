00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,800
如果希特勒在十天后获胜

140
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:24,409
他会对付那些反对者
he'll try to silencethose who are against him

141
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,453
那人说爸爸的护照会被拿走
The man saidthat papa's passport would be taken

142
00:10:29,627 --> 00:10:32,913
他现在应该离开德国,而他仍然可以
and that he should leave Germany now,while he still can

143
00:10:33,251 --> 00:10:35,582
离开? 但我们住在这里

144
00:10:35,753 --> 00:10:37,290
而且爸爸感冒了
And papa has the flu

145
00:10:37,365 --> 00:10:39,332
他今天早上感觉好多了

146
00:10:41,128 --> 00:10:44,318
爸爸对那个人的担心很认真

147
00:10:46,091 --> 00:10:50,858
今天一大早,他就去了捷克的布拉格
So very early this morninghe went to Prague, czechoslovakia

148
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:53,367
希特勒怎么知道爸爸受不了他?
How does Hitler knowpapa can't stand him?

149
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:54,878
所有人都知道

150
00:10:54,902 --> 00:10:57,813
他在报纸明确表明了反对立场
He states his opinionvery clearly in the paper

151
00:10:58,038 --> 00:11:00,171
他在收音机里也说过

152
00:11:00,842 --> 00:11:04,088
- 而现在呢? - 我们将等待选举结束
- And now?      - We'll wait for the elections

153
00:11:04,886 --> 00:11:06,797
如果希特勒胜出...

154
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,606
我们去布拉格见爸爸
We'll go to meet papa in Prague

155
00:11:12,236 --> 00:11:14,772
如果他输了,爸爸会回来的
And if he loses,papa will come back home

156
00:11:15,972 --> 00:11:17,883
但我不想离开!
But I don't want to leave!

157
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:20,553
我也是
Neither do I

158
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,827
但听着
But listen

159
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:28,618
不能让任何人,任何人
Nobody, absolutely nobody

160
00:11:28,626 --> 00:11:31,191
知道爸爸已经离开德国的事
can know that papa has left Germany

161
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,286
这很重要
That's very important

162
00:11:33,521 --> 00:11:35,762
你不能告诉任何人
You mustn't tell anybody

163
00:11:37,623 --> 00:11:40,114
- 格达和奥利呢? - 还有艾斯贝斯?
- What about Gunther and Oli?      - And elsbeth?

164
00:11:40,113 --> 00:11:43,319
谁都不行,绝对不行!
Absolutely not. Nobody!

165
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,448
我也是犹太人
I'm Jewish too

166
00:11:53,518 --> 00:11:56,079
- 从什么时候开始? - 一直都是
- Since when?      - Since forever

167
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,540
是吗? 我不知道
Really? I had no idea

168
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,816
我也不知道
Me neither

169
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,552
但你的鼻子甚至...
But your nose isn't even...

170
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,298
- 艾斯贝斯,不是每个... - 安娜?
- Elsbeth, not every...      - Anna?

171
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:10,319
你父亲还生病吗?
Is your father still sick?

172
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:14,596
- 是的,他得了流感 - 他已经病很长时间了
- Yes, he has the flu   - He's had that for a very long time

173
00:12:15,063 --> 00:12:17,278
很奇怪,不是吗?
That's strange, isn't it?

174
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:19,773
他发烧多高?
How high is his fever?

175
00:12:20,243 --> 00:12:22,150
我得回家了,我妈妈在等

祝他早日康复! 是的
Give him my best wishes! Yes

177
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,219
跟他说我想念他在报纸上写的...
Tell him I miss his articles in the paper...

178
00:12:28,189 --> 00:12:30,389
那些刻薄的文章!
Those mean articles!

179
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:31,599
安娜!

180
00:12:33,718 --> 00:12:35,499
妈妈,什么事?

181

兰贝克太太在外面...

- Why are you here? Don't you have work?      - Not today

185
00:12:47,677 --> 00:12:52,046
你在和我们一起吃饭吗?

很漂亮,谢谢
It's beautiful, thank you

189
00:13:05,611 --> 00:13:09,354
动物园里的大象怎么样? 太好了,他们不在乎希特勒
How are the elephants in the zoo?Wonderful. They don't care about Hitler

190
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:12,398
他们只是快乐的春天来了,所以他们可以回到外面
They're just happy spring is comingso they can get back outside

191
00:13:15,121 --> 00:13:17,362
安娜,你的外套

我们该去看那个小家伙了
It's about timewe visited the little one

193
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:25,043
我敢打赌他现在都长大了

194
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,875

- 但是... - 我不能把这些东西都拿走
- But...      - I can't take all of this stuff

205
00:14:14,055 --> 00:14:16,421
- 但这是不对的 - 当然
- But this isn't right      - Of course it is

206
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:18,510
他担心他们会拿走我们的护照

207
00:14:18,768 --> 00:14:21,100
我们是他的家人我们是犹太人
We're his family and we're Jews

208
00:14:22,605 --> 00:14:25,062
- 但不是合适的 - 没错
- But not proper ones      - Exactly

209
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:29,396
- 学校呢? - 还有海皮?

212
00:14:35,326 --> 00:14:38,534
你毫无理由地打包这些东西
You're packing all this for no reason

213
00:14:38,704 --> 00:14:41,411
两周后,我们将再次参观动物园

221
00:15:03,312 --> 00:15:06,645
最重要的是我们不争论
The most important thingis that we don't argue

222
00:15:06,816 --> 00:15:09,273
其次,我们必须打包,两本书一个玩具,就这样

第三,不要生病

And I'll say this again.We're not telling anybody our plan

225
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:27,078
你们俩现在都有秘密要保密,这是一件很成熟的事情
You both have a secret to keep now.That's a very grownup thing

226
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:29,118
很艰难
This is tough

227
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:33,334
我爱你们所有人
I love all of you

228
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:36,467
如果我带走泰瑞,兔子会很伤心的
If I take Terri,the rabbit will be sad

229
00:15:36,637 --> 00:15:39,470
如果我带走兔子,泰瑞会很伤心的
And if I take the rabbit,Terri will be sad

230
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:44,091
它们是填充动物,它们没有感情
They're stuffed animals,they don't have feelings

231
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,477
可惜我们不能参加棋盘游戏
It's a shamewe can't take the board games

232
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:49,059
我今年圣诞节才买的
I only just got them this Christmas

233
00:15:49,233 --> 00:15:53,522
今年圣诞节我也有泰瑞
I got Terri this Christmas too

234
00:15:53,696 --> 00:15:56,233
- 那就跟你一起去吧 - 但我养兔子这么久了
- Then take it with you      - But I've had the rabbit for so long

235
00:15:56,407 --> 00:15:59,365
不管怎么说,你年纪太大了,不适合吃毛绒动物
You're too oldfor stuffed animals anyway

236
00:15:59,952 --> 00:16:01,817
把你的铅笔留在这里,你可以同时拿两支
Leave your drawing pencils hereand you could take both

237
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:36,644
不可能!

238
00:16:37,448 --> 00:16:39,154
好的,安娜,熄灯
All right, Anna, lights out

239
00:16:39,825 --> 00:16:41,690
我不能选择,海皮

240
00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:44,155
我爱他们俩
I love them both

241
00:16:46,624 --> 00:16:48,034
如果我留下一个,他们就不会明白
If I leave one behind,they won't understand

242
00:16:49,335 --> 00:16:51,621
听我说
Listen to me

243
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:54,586
明天你走后

我会把你的兔子和一些好书放进去
I'll put your rabbit in thereand some nice books

246
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:04,221
还有棋盘游戏

247
00:17:04,475 --> 00:17:06,466
当我知道你在哪里时,我会寄给你
When I know where you are,I'll send it to you

248
00:17:06,644 --> 00:17:09,681
好吗?
All right?

249
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:14,314
你来的时候就带着吧
You could just bring it with youwhen you come

250
00:17:17,863 --> 00:17:20,400
说吧,海皮

再见,海皮

256
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:54,267
你能把你的大歌剧拍下来有点不公平
It's a bit unfair that you can takeyour whole huge opera

257
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:58,855
我们只允许一个玩具
and we're only allowed one toy

258
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,691
没有什么是不公平的,我在那部歌剧上干了两年

她让我帮她

460
00:35:48,806 --> 00:35:52,549
什么?

你能去拿手提箱吗?
Could you go and get the suitcase?

- 里面有玩具,我们需要它们! - 这不是关于你的玩具

487
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:38,158
是的,不是这个问题
Yes. That's not the problem

488
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,456
只是很难发表我的作品
It's just difficult to publish my work

489
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:43,959
为什么?

491

492

496
00:38:13,451 --> 00:38:16,193

- Can I touch her?      - She's afraid of strangers

497
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:21,326
你得小心点,没有快速动作

你在这里很安全

00:38:26,297 --> 00:38:29,334
- 那是最重要的 - 我不确定
- That's the main thing      - I'm not sure

500
00:38:29,592 --> 00:38:31,253
或许我不该离开,德国需要我们的声音
Maybe I shouldn't have left.Germany needs our voices

501
00:38:36,057 --> 00:38:38,093
你在开玩笑吗?

502
00:38:40,478 --> 00:38:43,936
还记得提特尔鲍姆教授吗?

他们把他从大学带到营地

505

附在铁链上

他不得不爬上去

507

从狗碗里吃他的食物

他睡在木屋的地板上

He had to bark every timesomeone went in or out of the camp

510
00:39:08,464 --> 00:39:11,046
否则他们会用棍子打他
or they'd beat him with sticks

511
00:39:18,141 --> 00:39:19,847
链子太短了,他受不了
The chain was so shortthat he couldn't stand

512
00:39:51,257 --> 00:39:54,215
两个月后他自杀了

513
00:39:55,845 --> 00:39:57,631
安娜,你心中有一束温暖的光

你能再给我吹一次吗?

不管怎样,男孩都是傻瓜
Boys are dummies anyway

535

你需要更多的力量

你得像这样伸展你的腿

他没有写我的名字是因为纳粹
He didn't write my namebecause of the Nazis

好好照顾自己,好吗?

Boys and girls are separated at school.Everything's different than Berlin

622
00:48:51,088 --> 00:48:56,082

623
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,546
即使你现在十岁了,你也永远是我的小女孩

628
00:49:36,884 --> 00:49:41,969
没有人为了好玩而流亡
Nobody goes into exile for fun

629
00:49:42,139 --> 00:49:44,676
你喜欢你小时候的地方,喜欢人和语言

630
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:47,512
我一直认为当评论家是荒谬的
I always thoughtit was absurd to be a critic

631
00:49:49,146 --> 00:49:52,980
如果批评是你所做的一切

632
00:49:53,984 --> 00:49:58,273
一年前,德国剧院开了花,种类繁多,富有
A year ago, German theaterwas blossoming, varied and rich

633
00:50:00,157 --> 00:50:02,648
今天它是匮乏的,扭曲的,空洞的
Today it is wanting,distorted and hollow

634
00:50:02,826 --> 00:50:05,738
我的工作是评估目前的状况

甚至从我流亡的地方

638
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,066
这一定是你过过的最无聊的生日

海皮会做草莓蛋糕

你至少卖了一篇文章吗?

642
00:50:52,918 --> 00:50:55,284
不会那么快,安娜

643
00:51:01,468 --> 00:51:05,006
但我谈得很好

644
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,295
你知道什么? 你还没有十岁

为什么不呢?

你1923年6月14日6：05在夏洛滕堡医院出生
You were born at 6:05 on June 14th 1923in charlottenburg hospital

647
00:51:20,696 --> 00:51:22,561
我和你哥哥麦克斯在隔壁的酒馆吃肉丸
I was at the tavern next doorsharing meatballs with your brother Max

648
00:51:22,739 --> 00:51:26,197
我们很紧张
We were very nervous

649
00:51:32,082 --> 00:51:36,701
隔壁的酒馆? 麦克斯当时才三岁

650
00:51:43,176 --> 00:51:46,589
我从没想过你的十岁生日会在瑞士的船上
I never imagined your tenth birthdaywould be on a boat in Switzerland

651
00:51:46,763 --> 00:51:49,254
难道不能继续批评希特勒吗?
Isn't it dangerousto keep criticizing Hitler?

652
00:51:51,268 --> 00:51:52,883
纳粹也能在这里找到我们
The Nazis could find us here too

653
00:51:54,438 --> 00:51:57,020
我不想害怕,安娜
I don't want to be fearful, Anna

654
00:52:00,235 --> 00:52:02,567
不管怎样,我们已经在逃亡了
And anyway, we're already on the run

655
00:52:02,738 --> 00:52:04,103
你不介意当难民吧?
Don't you mind being a refugee?

656
00:52:05,657 --> 00:52:09,616
我知道
I do

657
00:52:09,786 --> 00:52:11,572
但我也觉得很有趣,你11岁的时候谁知道我们会在哪里
But I find it interesting too.Who knows where we'll be when you're 11

658
00:52:12,581 --> 00:52:14,037
或者你127岁的时候
Or when you're 127

659

在家里?

00:52:30,223 --> 00:52:33,135
我在这里赚不到钱,瑞士人不给我工作
I can't earn any money here.The Swiss won't give me work

661
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:35,426
我想我们得搬到另一个国家去
I think we'll haveto move on to another country

662
00:52:37,147 --> 00:52:39,308
- 哪里? - 也许是巴黎
- Where?      - Maybe Paris

663
00:52:39,483 --> 00:52:42,771
我可以写一篇犹太论文
There's a Jewish paperI could write for

664
00:52:42,945 --> 00:52:46,654
巴黎? 麦克斯和我得学法语
Paris?Max and I would have to learn French

665
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:52,526
所以呢? 你的头很聪明
So what?You've a clever head on your shoulders

666
00:52:57,626 --> 00:52:58,957
我想我不习惯做难民
I don't think I've got usedto being a refugee

667
00:53:00,712 --> 00:53:03,294
我现在十岁了吗?

668
00:53:10,305 --> 00:53:14,639
是的,刚好6：05

670
00:53:19,022 --> 00:53:21,684
我们一定会有一个艰难的童年
We'll certainly havea difficult childhood now

671

你看? 一切都有好处

- 你一个人能应付十天吗? - 当然
- Can you manage ten days alone?      - Sure

673
00:53:31,451 --> 00:53:34,409
对吧,小家伙?
Right, little man?

674
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:36,570
如果我们喜欢巴黎找个公寓

675
00:53:37,541 --> 00:53:40,328
我们可能会早点回来

676
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,285
今晚我们要吃香肠
Tonight we're havingrosti with sausages

677
00:53:44,506 --> 00:53:46,997
听兹维恩夫人的话,照她说的做
Listen to Mrs. zwirnand do what she says

678

679
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:54,717
你要好好表现,好吗?
And you'll behave yourselves, okay?

680
00:53:56,935 --> 00:53:58,596
我每天给你写一张明信片

683
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:07,316
你们两个将代表我们在瑞士的家人
you two will be representingour family in Switzerland

684
00:54:07,487 --> 00:54:09,227
这是一个很大的责任
That's a big responsibility

685
00:54:13,201 --> 00:54:15,988
为什么?
Why?

686
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:19,533
因为我们犹太人分散在世界各地
Because we Jews live scatteredaround the world

687
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,832
纳粹在散布关于我们的可怕谎言
and the Nazis are spreadingterrible lies about us

688
00:54:23,795 --> 00:54:25,877
所以这对像我们这样的人来说很重要
So it's very importantfor people like us

689
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:28,876
证明他们是错的
to prove that they are wrong

690
00:54:29,509 --> 00:54:31,625
我们该怎么做?
How do we do that?

691
00:54:31,803 --> 00:54:34,260
比别人更诚实
By being more honest than others

692
00:54:34,431 --> 00:54:37,343
更勤奋,慷慨和礼貌
more hard-working,generous and polite

693
00:54:38,351 --> 00:54:40,592
我们得让人们知道做犹太人是件好事
We have to show peoplethat it's good to be Jewish

694
00:54:40,771 --> 00:54:43,763
我相信等我们回来
I'm sure that when we get back

695
00:54:49,654 --> 00:54:51,815
我们会为你代表我们感到骄傲的
we'll be very proudof how you represented us

696
00:54:52,074 --> 00:54:53,564
- 好好保管好帽子,安娜 - 我会的
- Take good care of the hat, Anna      - I will

697
00:54:55,035 --> 00:54:56,775
你,麦克斯
And you, Max

698
00:54:56,953 --> 00:54:58,659
好好照顾安娜

00:55:08,298 --> 00:55:11,665
再见

700
00:55:11,927 --> 00:55:15,135
- 你一定要回来? - 我们当然回来了!
- You're definitely coming back?      - Of course we are!

701
00:55:15,305 --> 00:55:17,421
别忘了来接我们,别忘了我们!
Don't forget to come and get us.Don't forget us!

702
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:19,885
安娜,你疯了吗?
Anna, are you crazy?

703
00:55:54,594 --> 00:55:58,337
我永远不会忘记我的孩子!
I'd never forget my children!

704
00:55:58,515 --> 00:56:01,678
别吃那么多了,瓦利,你越来越重了
Stop eating so much, vali.You're getting heavier

705
00:56:01,852 --> 00:56:05,390
如果我不吃,我会头晕,我已经头晕了
If I don't eat, I get dizzy.I'm dizzy already

706
00:56:13,905 --> 00:56:16,362
快到了,瓦利,你能做到的!
Nearly there, vali.You can do it!

707
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:24,951
嘿,不要打架!
Hey, no fighting!

708
00:56:25,584 --> 00:56:27,745
嘿,安娜
Hey, Anna

709
00:56:27,919 --> 00:56:30,831
你爸爸今天在报纸上
Your dad was in the paper today

710
00:56:31,006 --> 00:56:32,621
是吗? 所以他终于卖了一篇文章
Really?So he finally sold an article

711
00:56:32,883 --> 00:56:34,464
不,不是那个
No, it wasn't that

712
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,627
上面说他们在找他
It said they're looking for him

713
00:56:38,889 --> 00:56:40,845
阿道夫·希特勒甚至在他的头上付出了代价
Adolf Hitler has even puta price on his head

714
00:56:42,601 --> 00:56:45,513
1000瑞奇马克
1000 reichsmark

715
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:48,266
但别担心
But don't worry

716
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,556
希特勒不能在这里碰他
Hitler can't touch him here

717
00:57:08,126 --> 00:57:10,367
他在瑞士很安全
He's safe here in Switzerland

718
00:57:10,545 --> 00:57:14,788
害怕新学校?
Scared of the new school?

719
00:57:14,966 --> 00:57:16,422
可能是那种语言,但我还是理解了你
Of the language maybe.But I managed to understand you

720
00:57:16,593 --> 00:57:18,049
不过,我会说德语
I speak German though

721
00:57:19,888 --> 00:57:23,005
或多或少
More or less

722
00:57:23,183 --> 00:57:26,391
那边那两个人也是德国人
Those two over thereare from Germany too

723
00:57:26,561 --> 00:57:28,097
我知道,但他们不跟我玩
I know.But they don't play with me

724
00:57:35,195 --> 00:57:37,777
他们是纳粹
They're Nazis

725
00:57:37,948 --> 00:57:39,688
和他们玩是不是很糟糕?
Is it bad to play with them?

726
00:57:39,866 --> 00:57:44,451
不
No

727
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:02,677
他们能在两周内回柏林真糟糕,我做不到
It's bad that they can go back to Berlinin two weeks and I can't

728
00:58:06,309 --> 00:58:08,220
快醒醒! 是什么?
Wake up! "What is it?

729
00:58:08,395 --> 00:58:10,727
是空的
It's empty

730
00:58:16,611 --> 00:58:21,230
再也没有什么味道了
It doesn't smell of anything anymore

731
00:58:26,997 --> 00:58:28,783
不,安娜,对不起,今天没有明信片
No, Anna, I'm sorry.There was no postcard today

732
00:58:28,957 --> 00:58:30,993
什么都没有
Nothing

733
00:58:31,668 --> 00:58:33,829
我们明天可能会有三个
We'll probably get three tomorrow

734
00:58:51,813 --> 00:58:54,680
写你的远足,他们会喜欢的
Write about your hike.They'll like that

735
00:58:54,858 --> 00:58:59,477
为什么要给别人的头定价,麦克斯? "什么?
Why put a price on someone's head, Max?"What?

736
00:59:01,614 --> 00:59:06,608
格劳佩先生说希特勒给了爸爸一个代价
Mr. graupe said that Hitlerhad put a price on papa's head

737
00:59:06,786 --> 00:59:09,118
当你答应给别人一个奖励,因为你找到了别人
It's when you promise someone a rewardfor finding someone else

738
00:59:10,248 --> 00:59:13,160
我们已经知道希特勒在找他
We already knewHitler's looking for him

739
00:59:24,846 --> 00:59:28,430
不管怎样,我希望爸爸现在在这里
Anyhow, I wish papa was here now

740
00:59:28,975 --> 00:59:30,306
早上好,祝大家度过美好的一天
Good morning.I wish you all a wonderful day

741
00:59:32,103 --> 00:59:33,103
谢谢
Thank you

742
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:41,689
快点
Come on

743
00:59:41,863 --> 00:59:45,105
很勇敢,你觉得他们意识到你在开玩笑?
That was very brave.Think they realized you were teasing?

744
00:59:48,578 --> 00:59:50,443
我没有,我是想表现得更有礼貌
I wasn't.I was trying to be extra polite

745
00:59:51,748 --> 00:59:53,488
四处转转,加油!
Go around. Go on!

746
00:59:53,666 --> 00:59:55,406
加油! 你抓不到我
Go on! You can't get me

747
00:59:55,585 --> 00:59:58,292
是的,我会的,别担心
Yes, I will. Don't you worry

748
00:59:58,546 --> 01:00:00,377
帮帮我! 小偷太快了!
Help me! The thief is too fast!

749
01:00:05,136 --> 01:00:07,673
快走!
Go!

750
01:00:07,931 --> 01:00:09,387
爸爸,我太怕你了!
Papa, I was so scared for your head!

751
01:00:09,557 --> 01:00:11,969
我的头?
My head?

752
01:00:13,269 --> 01:00:15,681
因为希特勒为此付出了代价
Because Hitler put a price on it

753
01:00:16,481 --> 01:00:18,472
我也有点担心,你好,你
I was a little worried about that too.Hello, you

754
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:22,359
是吗? 是的
Really? Yes

755
01:00:22,529 --> 01:00:25,646
1000马克对我这样的人来说很便宜,你不觉得吗?
1000 Mark is pretty cheapfor someone like me, don't you think?

756
01:00:25,824 --> 01:00:27,189
我很想写希特勒的正式控诉书
I'm tempted to write Hitlera formal complaint

757
01:00:27,367 --> 01:00:29,608
妈妈在哪?
Where is mama?

758
01:00:29,786 --> 01:00:31,322
她在巴黎,修我们的公寓
She's in Paris,fixing up our apartment

759
01:00:32,455 --> 01:00:34,320
我们的公寓? 是的
Our apartment? Yes

760
01:00:37,752 --> 01:00:39,492
它有阳台和厨房
It has a balcony and a kitchen

761
01:00:39,671 --> 01:00:42,128
剩下的我来做,太重了
I'll do the rest. It's too heavy

762
01:00:42,298 --> 01:00:45,415
里面有一整块奶酪
There's a whole cheese in there

763

770
01:01:19,919 --> 01:01:24,083
安娜在哪里"?
Where is Anna"?

771
01:01:25,258 --> 01:01:27,249
我很难过你要走了,你是我最好的朋友
I'm sad that you're leaving.You're my best friend

772
01:01:27,886 --> 01:01:31,470
你不也难过吗?
Aren't you sad too?

773
01:01:31,639 --> 01:01:33,880
是的,我是,但作为一个难民你经常说再见

774
01:01:34,058 --> 01:01:36,390
这是我艰难童年的一部分
It's part of my difficult childhood

775
01:01:36,686 --> 01:01:38,677
安娜,快点! 我们得走了

776
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:49,479
看看我在练习什么

777

太好了,维尼利!

再见,安娜

783
01:02:55,348 --> 01:02:57,213
听着
Look

784
01:03:00,770 --> 01:03:04,433
是埃菲尔铁塔
It's the Eiffel Tower

785
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:09,233
建造它的人不是埃菲尔,而是波尼克豪森
The man who built itwasn't called eiffel, but bonickhausen

786
01:03:09,404 --> 01:03:11,235
法国人说不出伊索他们叫他埃菲尔
The French couldn't pronounce itso they called him eiffel

787
01:03:12,532 --> 01:03:14,363
因为他来自埃菲尔地区
because he was from the eifel area

788
01:03:53,948 --> 01:03:56,189
他们也不会发音
They can't pronounce that either

789
01:03:56,367 --> 01:03:57,823
我以为是黄色的
I thought it was yellow

790
01:03:58,828 --> 01:04:02,116
为什么?
Why?

791
01:04:02,373 --> 01:04:04,910
- 因为爸爸说它有阳台 - 所以它必须是黄色的?
- Because papa said it has a balcony      - So it had to be yellow?

792
01:04:07,462 --> 01:04:08,872

01:04:55,802 --> 01:04:57,383
- 我们有电梯吗? - 是因为我们现在有钱了吗?
- Do we have an elevator?      - Is that because we're rich now?

810
01:05:10,858 --> 01:05:12,894

我想知道是什么感觉

818
01:05:40,805 --> 01:05:43,296
这是你的房间,黄色的
This is your room, the yellow one

819
01:05:45,435 --> 01:05:47,175

我想"老板娘"是给女人的

我看那个胡桃夹子!
I ook at that nutcracker!

1006
01:20:29,067 --> 01:20:30,932
闻起来像格鲁尼沃德
It smells like grunewald

1007
01:20:31,111 --> 01:20:32,442
我希望今年我们有一棵圣诞树

当然!

我亲爱的朋友

1010
01:20:41,288 --> 01:20:44,496
你的明信片是黑暗地平线上的光芒
Your postcards are rays of lighton an otherwise dark horizon

1011
01:20:44,666 --> 01:20:47,282
你是唯一一个从家里听到的人
You are the only one from back homewhom we hear from

他们现在在哪里?

1014
01:20:53,759 --> 01:20:54,919
我不禁怀疑过去他们是否会离开
I can't help wonderingif in the past they would have left

1015

我从没想过我会写这个

1018
01:21:11,568 --> 01:21:14,230
但恐怕我得请你卖几个我们的第一版
but I'm afraid I must ask you to sella few of our first editions

1019
01:21:15,322 --> 01:21:17,984
我被剥夺了德国国籍
I've had myGerman citizenship taken away

1020
01:21:19,701 --> 01:21:23,944
现在我主要是一件事：犹太人
Now I'm primarily one thing: A Jew

1021
01:21:27,292 --> 01:21:29,374
至少这意味着我们不属于被误导的群众或纳粹暴徒
At least that means we don't belongto the misled masses or the Nazi mob

1022
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:32,126
犹太人是有经验的移民
And Jews are experienced emigrants

1023
01:21:32,297 --> 01:21:35,585
尽管很痛苦

我很高兴属于一个有着如此丰富遗产的民族

01:22:29,771 --> 01:22:31,227
你还记得我吗?

1030
01:22:31,481 --> 01:22:32,846
恐怕我没有
I'm afraid I don't

1031

也许你和你的家人可以过来喝茶

1041

柏林现在是古老的历史

1042
01:23:15,525 --> 01:23:17,106
我很乐意花时间和这么聪明的人在一起

爸爸,你不喜欢那个人吗?
Papa, don't you like that man?

1048
01:23:31,875 --> 01:23:33,957
我没有理由不去

1049

但我想他可能不喜欢我

1050
01:23:42,385 --> 01:23:43,625
我们在犹太教堂撞见了罗伯特·斯坦

- You tore him to pieces a few times      - Very true

1053
01:23:52,103 --> 01:23:54,469
他是个很没天分的导演
He's an intensely untalented director

1054
01:23:54,731 --> 01:23:56,346
他的作品令人难以忍受

1055

我以为他很好
I thought he was nice

1056
01:24:00,487 --> 01:24:02,023
我的工作不是找出他有多好

他很坏就是这样

如果你这么说那一定是真的

1069
01:24:51,746 --> 01:24:53,452
有人怀疑他们会吗?
Did somebody doubt they would?

1070
01:24:59,629 --> 01:25:02,041
过来,这是给你的

1071
01:25:02,299 --> 01:25:04,210

不错啊,小家伙!

我不想给你更多的灾难

1078
01:25:25,322 --> 01:25:27,563
这是书包吗?

1079
01:25:28,491 --> 01:25:31,107
你妈妈给你找了所公立学校

1080
01:25:31,369 --> 01:25:33,360
我觉得那些学校对我们这样的人不好

1081
01:25:35,332 --> 01:25:36,913
谁说的这么胡说八道?
Who says such nonsense?

1082
01:25:43,506 --> 01:25:45,167
很难想象
That's hard to imagine

1083
01:25:46,343 --> 01:25:48,709
你怎么...
How did you...

Drop this balloon from the Eiffel Tower

1094

If we're Jewish,why do we celebrate Christmas?

1101
01:27:32,115 --> 01:27:34,356
我把它看作是德国的庆典而不是基督教的庆典
I see it as a German celebrationrather than a Christian one

1102

01:33:33,434 --> 01:33:35,345
没人能想象他会变成什么样
Nobody could have imaginedwhat would become of him

1170
01:33:35,603 --> 01:33:39,095
他的母亲叫拉蒂西亚

1171
01:33:39,273 --> 01:33:42,731
- 你怎么拿到钱的? - 拿破仑想得到承认

他在学校表现出色

But his mother always said,"let's see how long it lasts"

1178

结果不太好
And it didn't turn out well

1179
01:34:09,929 --> 01:34:12,841
如果她表现出对他的骄傲会有不同吗?
Would it have been differentif she'd shown pride in him?

1180
01:34:13,516 --> 01:34:16,883

1183

1184
01:34:27,029 --> 01:34:30,521
我刚才又读了一遍

- 我在写他童年的剧本 - 看电影?
- I'm doing a script about his childhood      - For a movie?

1186
01:34:36,038 --> 01:34:37,494
如果有人买了它,那么它可能会变成电影

1187
01:34:39,167 --> 01:34:40,623

你知道拿破仑的事吗?

01:34:50,428 --> 01:34:53,920
是的,他身上没有音乐的骨头

1192
01:34:54,098 --> 01:34:58,216
他唯一喜欢的就是鼓和小号
The only thing he likedwere drums and trumpets

1193
01:35:30,843 --> 01:35:33,084
但他一直记得有一个科西嘉托儿所押韵
But there was a corsican nursery rhymethat he always remembered

1194
01:35:33,262 --> 01:35:34,843
爸爸又做噩梦了
Papa is having nightmares again

1195
01:35:35,014 --> 01:35:36,470
让我睡吧
Let me sleep

1196
01:35:56,035 --> 01:35:57,900
但我很害怕
But I'm scared

1197
01:36:07,338 --> 01:36:09,329
你睡不着吗?
Can't you sleep?

1198

格雷特是纳粹吗?

1199
01:36:15,137 --> 01:36:17,423
或许吧
Maybe

1200
01:36:18,766 --> 01:36:21,223
也许她只是不喜欢犹太人
Perhaps she just doesn't like Jews

1201
01:36:24,146 --> 01:36:27,388
就像普鲁恩夫人
Like madame prune

1202
01:36:28,609 --> 01:36:30,440
- 会有食物吗? - 当然,不要太大声
- Will there be food?      - Certainly. Don't be too loud

1203
01:36:35,658 --> 01:36:36,658

- 你要利口酒吗? - 当然
- Would you like a liqueur?      - Certainly

1227
01:38:12,088 --> 01:38:15,000
它适合我吗? 我会穿在高尔夫球场上
Does it suit me?I'll wear it on the golf course

1228
01:38:15,174 --> 01:38:18,257
多么迷人的主意啊! 你看起来像个牛油杯
What a charming idea!You look like a buttercup

1229
01:38:18,803 --> 01:38:22,216
你后面会有成群的蝴蝶
You'll be followedby swarms of butterflies

1230
01:38:22,473 --> 01:38:25,260
而你,我最亲爱的心,就像灯罩
And you, my dearest heart,look like a lampshade

1231
01:38:25,434 --> 01:38:27,595
想吃什么就吃什么,反正我们有太多了
Take whatever you like.We have too much anyway

1232
01:38:27,853 --> 01:38:29,593
如果你不这样做,它就会捐给穷人
If you don't,it'll be donated to the needy

1233
01:38:30,231 --> 01:38:33,473
我们也很需要
We're needy too

1234
01:38:33,651 --> 01:38:35,266
我们也有很多我们已经读过的德语书
We also have lots of German booksthat we already read

1235
01:38:36,112 --> 01:38:37,568
你知道怎么读书,不是吗?
You know how to read, don't you?

1236
01:38:38,739 --> 01:38:42,573
看书?
Read?

1237
01:39:24,201 --> 01:39:25,407
你什么意思? 我们的父母不相信教育
What do you mean?Our parents don't believe in education

1238
01:39:26,162 --> 01:39:29,074
你会把这些都还给我的!
You'll give that all back!

1239
01:39:30,166 --> 01:39:31,997
我的孩子不需要施舍,当然不是那个小丑!
My kids don't need handouts.Certainly not from that clown!

1240
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:34,916
我们不是乞丐!
We're not beggars!

1241
01:39:35,713 --> 01:39:38,420
你知道你的孩子需要什么吗?
Do you know what your kids need?

1242
01:39:38,591 --> 01:39:40,252
他们需要食物和衣服
They need food and clothes

1243
01:39:40,426 --> 01:39:42,462
还有各种各样的东西
and all kinds of things

1244
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:46,716
我不能少管我们从哪里得到它
And I couldn't care lesswhere we get it

1245
01:39:46,891 --> 01:39:48,631
你不再是住在格鲁尼瓦尔德的著名评论家了
You're not a famous criticliving in grunewald anymore

1246
01:39:50,478 --> 01:39:54,312
那些日子结束了
Those days are over

1247
01:39:54,482 --> 01:39:56,313
如果衣服是给可怜的孩子穿的
If the clothes were meantfor poor children anyway

1248
01:39:56,484 --> 01:39:59,317
为什么不把它们给我们的?
why not give them to ours?

1249
01:40:00,821 --> 01:40:02,561
我不会把裤子还给你,你不必这么做
I'm not giving these pants back.You don't have to

1250
01:40:15,586 --> 01:40:17,497
我们现在穷吗?
Are we poor now?

1251
01:40:17,671 --> 01:40:19,832
- 很好,曼农 - 谢谢

安娜,147个错误
Anna, 147 mistakes

1253

你得更加努力
You have to work harder

1254
01:40:26,555 --> 01:40:28,136
否则你就不会上下一节课了
or you won't move up to the next class

1255
01:40:33,562 --> 01:40:35,393
你明白吗?
Do you understand?

1256
01:40:36,106 --> 01:40:38,313
罗莎莉,很好
Rosalie, good

安娜,你的鞋子很漂亮

1258
01:40:41,237 --> 01:40:44,070
- 凯瑟琳,很好 - 谢谢

伊莎贝尔,注意逗号

01:40:54,458 --> 01:40:56,369
一年前,他失去了在自然历史博物馆的工作
A year ago, he lost his jobat the natural history museum

1261
01:40:59,046 --> 01:41:00,502
我不知道
I didn't know that

1262
01:41:02,091 --> 01:41:05,299
你好
Hello

1263
01:41:05,469 --> 01:41:09,633
这是我们的女儿安娜,朱利叶斯是她的教父
This is our daughter Anna.Julius was her godfather

1264
01:41:09,807 --> 01:41:12,014
安娜,这是海因兹罗森菲尔德,朱利叶斯的朋友之一
Anna, this is heinz rosenfeld,one of Julius's friends

1265
01:41:13,102 --> 01:41:14,433
- 柏林 - 你好
- From Berlin      - Hello

1266
01:41:18,065 --> 01:41:20,602
你就是安娜
So, you're Anna

1267
01:41:21,861 --> 01:41:23,692
朱利叶斯不想让你担心
Julius didn't want you to worry

1268
01:41:25,322 --> 01:41:28,530
继续
Carry on

1269
01:41:29,410 --> 01:41:33,028
很长一段时间他表现得很好
He was doing fairly wellfor a long while

1270
01:41:34,748 --> 01:41:38,616
他每天去动物园参观他的动物
He went to the zoo every dayand visited his animals

1271
01:41:39,253 --> 01:41:42,837
他每周在一家卷烟厂干两次家务活
He did menial workin a cigarette factory twice a week

1272
01:41:48,554 --> 01:41:50,294
朱利叶斯知道我会去巴黎,我有家人在这里
Julius knew I would go to Paris.I have family here

1273
01:41:53,893 --> 01:41:58,728
他死了吗?
Is he dead?

1274
01:42:00,441 --> 01:42:02,853
当他们禁止他进入动物园后,他变得阴郁起来
After they banned him from the zoo,he became gloomy

1275
01:42:03,027 --> 01:42:04,938
他不会再离开他的房间了
He wouldn't leave his room any more

1276
01:42:06,196 --> 01:42:07,982
朱利叶斯是犹太人吗?
Was Julius Jewish?

1277
01:42:08,616 --> 01:42:10,982
他祖母是
His grandmother was

1278
01:42:18,667 --> 01:42:19,952
看来这对他们来说已经足够了
It seems that was enough for them

1279
01:42:21,170 --> 01:42:23,001
他很累
He was tired

1280
01:42:25,966 --> 01:42:30,255
他不想再活下去了
He didn't want to live anymore

1281
01:43:18,227 --> 01:43:20,843
但你收到这个对他很重要
But it was very important to himthat you receive this

1282
01:43:21,021 --> 01:43:22,727
你可以在两个主题之间进行选择

1283
01:43:22,898 --> 01:43:26,937
"旅程；

1284
01:43:32,533 --> 01:43:34,524
和"在海滩上的一天
and "a day at the beach"

1285
01:43:47,464 --> 01:43:49,830
你可以开始了
You can start

1286
01:43:50,092 --> 01:43:53,801
亚瑟,这毫无意义
Arthur, that's pointless

1287
01:43:54,763 --> 01:43:58,381
如果她今天找不到我们,她明天就回来
If she doesn't find us today,she'll come back tomorrow

1288
01:43:59,059 --> 01:44:01,391
明天我可能有钱,我现在不想和她打交道
Tomorrow I might have money.I don't want to deal with her right now

1289
01:44:01,645 --> 01:44:03,556
我们不在这里,灯不亮
We're not hereand the light stays off

1290
01:44:13,157 --> 01:44:14,897
我们还会在哪里?
Where else would we be?

1291
01:44:15,075 --> 01:44:17,691
也许只是格雷特
Maybe it's only grete

1292
01:44:22,916 --> 01:44:24,406
只有格雷特? 她甚至...
Only grete? She's even...

1293
01:44:26,420 --> 01:44:29,503
肯珀先生?
Mr. kemper?

1294
01:44:31,592 --> 01:44:33,082
别胡说了,开门!
Stop this nonsenseand open the door!

1295
01:44:34,136 --> 01:44:36,969
- 我知道你在那儿! - 如果我们...
- I know that you're there!      - If we...

1296
01:44:37,139 --> 01:44:38,629
当他们让像你这样的人进来的时候就会这样
This is what happenswhen they let people like you in

1297
01:44:40,392 --> 01:44:42,474
骗子!
Liars!

1298
01:44:42,644 --> 01:44:45,010
我在盯着你,肯珀先生!
I have my eye on you, Mr. kemper!

1299
01:44:45,189 --> 01:44:46,679
你不付钱就不会超过我
You won't get past me without paying

1300
01:44:46,857 --> 01:44:48,347
肮脏的犹太人
Dirty Jew

1301
01:44:53,906 --> 01:44:57,569
那是有辱人格的
That's degrading

1302
01:45:06,752 --> 01:45:08,037
14,15,16,17,18...
14, 15, 16, 17, 18...

1303
01:45:12,091 --> 01:45:15,333
谢谢你,夫人
Thank you, madame

1304
01:45:15,969 --> 01:45:18,255
夫人,为什么我的考试有钱?
Madame, why is there money on my test?

1305
01:45:18,430 --> 01:45:20,170
哦,对了,我完全忘了
Oh, right, I'd completely forgotten

1306
01:45:20,849 --> 01:45:24,933
孩子们,听我说
Children, listen to me

1307
01:45:25,562 --> 01:45:28,474
安娜一年前才到,一个字也说不出法语
Anna arrived only a year agoand couldn't speak a word of French

1308
01:45:29,149 --> 01:45:32,641
她的拼写仍有一些需要改进的地方
Her spelling still leavesomething to be desired

1309
01:45:33,278 --> 01:45:36,987
但她的论文赢得了学校比赛
but her essaywon the school competition

1310
01:45:37,241 --> 01:45:38,731
穆林先生为她的旅行故事给了她十法郎
Mr. moulin awarded her ten francsfor her journey story

1311
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:45,238
我们该怎么说?
What do we say?

1312
01:45:52,089 --> 01:45:54,501
安娜,请到前面来大声朗读你的故事
Anna, please come to the frontand read your story out loud

1313
01:45:55,843 --> 01:45:58,755
旅程,安娜·肯珀
"A journey". By Anna kemper

1314
01:45:58,929 --> 01:46:00,840
那是一个寒冷的二月夜
"It was a cold February night

1315
01:46:01,390 --> 01:46:03,221
亚瑟得了重感冒
Arthur had a bad cold

1316
01:46:04,184 --> 01:46:06,391
他应该呆在床上
He should have stayed in bed

1317
01:46:06,562 --> 01:46:09,770
突然电话响了
Suddenly the telephone rang

1318
01:46:10,274 --> 01:46:12,811
"我是朋友"声音说
I'm a friend, ' the voice said

1319
01:46:15,195 --> 01:46:17,186
我得警告你
'And I have to warn you.'

1320
01:46:17,364 --> 01:46:19,150
我的针线活失败了
I failed needlework

1321
01:46:19,324 --> 01:46:21,440
但我在运动方面做得很好
but I did really well in sport

1322
01:46:21,618 --> 01:46:22,824
我们不得不单腿站立两分钟
We had to standon one leg for two minutes

1323
01:46:23,078 --> 01:46:26,787
很简单
That was easy

1324
01:46:26,957 --> 01:46:29,824
所以要善于站在一条腿上为你的缝纫做准备?
So being good at standing on one legmakes up for how you sew?

1325
01:46:32,546 --> 01:46:34,411
只在女子学校!
Only at a girls' school!

1326
01:46:43,599 --> 01:46:45,885
谁从英国给爸爸写信?

你好,格雷特小姐

Don't be stupid.I won some money actually

1333
01:46:59,281 --> 01:47:01,988

- Shall I read you my story?      - Please do

1338
01:47:24,932 --> 01:47:26,763
数学不容易,但我也得了18分
Math wasn't easy,but I got 18 points there too

1339
01:47:26,934 --> 01:47:30,222
只有我和七年级的一个男孩能做到
Only me and one boyin the 7th managed that

1340
01:47:31,230 --> 01:47:33,642
是吗? 我有这么聪明的孩子

我们考虑搬到伦敦去

只是这里的工作不够
