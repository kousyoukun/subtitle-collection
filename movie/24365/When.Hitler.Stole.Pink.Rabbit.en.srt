00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,881
Berlin, February 1933

2
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,214
You're good at that, huh?

3
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,592
Scaring a handfulof little Chinese girls.

4
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,805
Why are you under the table?

5
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,433
The Nazis are after me.

6
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,061
The Nazis?

7
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,615
Hello there, Max.Aren't you a bit old to be Zorro?

8
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,031
At least it's a costume. Unlike you!

9
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,791
%%%Well, that's your opinion&&&Idiot.

10
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,541
Hey, give my rabbit back!

11
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,836
Catch!

12
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,923
Max, you show him!

13
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:20,717
Finish him off!

14
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,966
You show it to him, Max! Go on!

15
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,647
Based on the novel by Judith kerr

16
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,032
when Hitler stole pink rabbit

17
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:54,125
%%%We don't give to beggars&&&You heartless person!

18
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,257
Have you no pityfor a poor beggar child?

19
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:01,504
%%%And a hungry Zorro?&&&Not straight into the living room.

20
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,263
Come on, take off your wet things.

21
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,098
Max knocked them all down.

22
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,934
The cowboys, the Indians@@

23
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,762
And the Nazis.

24
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,555
%%%Yes!&&&That was great, Max.

25
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,399
I'm glad you had fun.

26
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,436
Here we go.

27
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:24,777
How did you both get so soaking wet?

28
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,911
We went down the sledding hill.

29
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,458
%%%Put on something warm. It's on the bed&&&Okay.

30
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:38,923
%%%You have cheeks like an old dog&&&Well, thank you.

31
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:40,968
Did the doctor come again?

32
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:45,848
He said your fatherneeds to stay in bed three more days.

33
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,342
He has to take it easyand he's not allowed to work

34
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,844
or go to the theater.

35
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,310
What are you doing?

36
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,442
%%%The sausages will drown&&&Their time is up anyhow.

37
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,824
Erich and Otto didn't dress up at all.

38
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,993
They just came as Nazis.

39
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:11,032
They're just as dumb as their parents.

40
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,495
Anna, don't be so cheeky.

41
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,499
%%%How was carnival?&&&Good.

42
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:18,997
Why eat in here?

43
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:22,134
%%%It's cozy in here with heimpi&&&That's true.

44
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:25,546
Are you going to another concert?Yes.

45
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,843
Miss fischer is singing schubert.

46
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,847
She's about to pick me up.

47
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:36,018
Max, your vocabulary bookis lying untouched on the desk.

48
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,775
After dinner, you study.

49
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:42,237
%%%Annuntio vobis gaudium: Habemus papam&&&What's that?

50
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,649
%%%"We have a pope"

51
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,365
%%%You're crazy.

52
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,959
Dorothea kemper.

53
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,413
Yes, speaking.

54
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,924
%%%Mama?&&&Who am I talking to?

55
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,959
Be quiet and finishthat mountain of potato.

56
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:13,473
Silentium. Favete linguis.

57
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,392
Fighting the Jew means removing the Jew!

58
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,396
Are you crazy?We're socialists, not Nazis.

59
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,437
And we're Jews ourselves.

60
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,736
Then you must be removed!

61
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,452
Get lost! I have to study.

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,206
You@@spoilsport.

63
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,596
Heimpi?

64
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,678
%%%They have no right&&&Mama? You're not@@

65
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,640
%%%Out! Close the door&&&But I@@

66
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:05,024
%%%I said get out! Now!&&&Come back later, honey.

67
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:09,032
It looked bad.I think mama was crying.

68
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:13,746
No way. Mama never cries.Maybe she was peeling onions.

69
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:17,373
Sure, she was peeling onions.Our mother! Wearing an evening gown.

70
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,459
Out you come, Anna.It must be cold in there by now.

71
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:27,046
In literature and theater,evil has many faces@@

72
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,085
%%%Papa, are you awake?&&&Goethe's devil Rose from@@

73
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:33,056
Come here, sweetheart.

74
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,050
He was the dreadful phantomof the unsuspecting@@

75
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,765
Not too close. I'm contagious.

76
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:42,061
Mephisto was at least a gentleman.

77
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,567
He came in personto ask faust for his soul.

78
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:48,939
Today the devil just sends his servants.

79
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,984
Foul and corrupt,with blood-stained hands,

80
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,572
screaming and full of rhetoric,it demands Germany's soul.

81
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,739
Is that you on the radio?

82
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,532
Yes.But you don't have to whisper.

83
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,666
I know what I said last week.

84
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,168
I will vote no against evil.

85
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,422
How was carnival?

86
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,246
So should you.

87
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,295
Great!

88
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,505
I was a beggar girl.

89
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,546
It was very exciting.

90
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,264
The donuts taste betterwhen you're poor.

91
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,389
That's true. What's that?

92
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:19,887
A shipwreck.

93
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,726
A shipwreck?

94
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,644
Mrs. funk told meto draw something nice.

95
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,907
Do you want to draw something nice?

96
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,577
It's like a curse.I can't think of anything but disasters.

97
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,290
This is the best shipwreckanyone ever drew.

98
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,590
You did a really good job.

99
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,760
It's not bad to draw such gloomy things?

100
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,547
If you want to draw a disaster,you should.

101
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,932
There's no point drawingwhat others expect.

102
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,393
That won't work.

103
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:17,076
Max captured this at the party.

104
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,993
In ancient times,the swastika was a good luck symbol.

105
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,207
Now it's reducedto a symbol of stupidity.

106
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,587
Throw it away.

107
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:35,504
Anna, you'll get sick too.

108
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,343
%%%I'm so scared sometimes, papa&&&Are you?

109
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,179
What are you scared of?

110
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,389
Of the fog and of the pin.

111
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,893
And mama was crying just now.

112
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,900
You'll get infected, honey.

113
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,106
No, I'll never get sick.

114
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,405
Heimpi takes care of me.

115
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,443
When you're sick,you need a lot of love.

116
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,071
Love is the best medicine in the world.

117
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,036
Hallelujah.

118
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,298
You're a very melodramaticlittle person.

119
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:17,804
Damn! All the snow has gone.

120
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,181
Papa.

121
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,112
Papa!

122
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,190
Heimpi!

123
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,653
Where is papa?

124
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,913
Anna!

125
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,453
%%%Did papa die?&&&No.

126
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,417
Max, you listen too.

127
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,004
What I'm about to sayis very important.

128
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:59,004
We had a phone call yesterday.

129
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:02,174
A man warned your father.A man from the police.

130
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,512
%%%That's why you didn't go out&&&Exactly.

131
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,725
There are lots of Nazis in the police,but this man isn't one.

132
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,734
He knows papa and he likes him

133
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:17,189
because of his newspaper articlesand his books.

134
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,028
He called to tell usthat papa's name is on a list.

135
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,568
What list?

136
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,072
If Hitler wins the electionten days from now,

137
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,579
he'll try to silencethose who are against him.

138
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,042
The man saidthat papa's passport would be taken

139
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,502
and that he should leave Germany now,while he still can.

140
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,091
Leave? But we live here.

141
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,799
And papa has the flu.

142
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,341
He was feeling much better this morning.

143
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:50,727
Papa is taking that man's concernsvery seriously.

144
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,107
So very early this morninghe went to Prague, czechoslovakia.

145
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,726
How does Hitler knowpapa can't stand him?

146
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,737
Everyone knows.

147
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,902
He states his opinionvery clearly in the paper.

148
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,660
And he says it on the radio.

149
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,822
%%%And now?&&&We'll wait for the elections.

150
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,286
If Hitler wins@@

151
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,295
We'll go to meet papa in Prague.

152
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,961
And if he loses,papa will come back home.

153
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,672
But I don't want to leave!

154
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,342
Neither do I.

155
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,680
But listen.

156
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,971
Nobody, absolutely nobody,

157
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,014
can know that papa has left Germany.

158
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,809
That's very important.

159
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,855
You mustn't tell anybody.

160
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,607
%%%What about Gunther and oli?&&&And elsbeth?

161
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,292
Absolutely not. Nobody!

162
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:56,421
I'm Jewish too.

163
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,752
%%%Since when?&&&Since forever.

164
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,417
Really? I had no idea.

165
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,053
Me neither.

166
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,389
But your nose isn't even@@

167
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:10,135
%%%Elsbeth, not every@@&&&Anna?

168
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:14,226
Is your father still sick?

169
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,233
%%%Yes, he has the flu&&&He's had that for a very long time.

170
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,435
That's strange, isn't it?

171
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,530
How high is his fever?

172
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,407
I have to go home.My mother is waiting.

173
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,990
Give him my best wishes! Yes.

174
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,246
Tell him I misshis articles in the paper@@

175
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,416
Those mean articles!

176
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,326
Anna!

177
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,086
Mama. Yes?

178
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,543
Mrs. lambeck was outside@@

179
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,049
%%%Hello, sweetheart&&&Hello.

180
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,760
%%%Uncle Julius!&&&Anna.

181
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,219
%%%Why are you here? Don't you have work?&&&Not today.

182
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:53,763
Are you eating with us?

183
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,223
I can't, I'm afraid.I stopped by to talk to your mother.

184
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,479
I brought you this.

185
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:07,154
It's beautiful, thank you.

186
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:11,071
How are the elephants in the zoo?Wonderful. They don't care about Hitler.

187
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,115
They're just happy spring is comingso they can get back outside.

188
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:19,079
Anna, your coat.

189
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,669
It's about timewe visited the little one.

190
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,760
I bet he's all grown up now.

191
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,592
Blow here.

192
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,852
Thank you.

193
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:43,236
Can Gunther eat with us?He knows papa is sick.

194
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:44,737
No, papa needs absolute rest.I'm sorry, Gunther.

195
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,489
That's all right.

196
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:54,327
%%%See you tomorrow, Max&&&Bye.

197
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,242
Your father has arrived in Prague.Uncle Julius met him there.

198
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:01,371
He doesn't want usto stay here any longer.

199
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,916
%%%We'll meet him in Switzerland tomorrow&&&Tomorrow?

200
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,842
Heimpi? Would you like this?

201
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,134
%%%But@@&&&I can't take all of this stuff.

202
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,138
%%%But this isn't right&&&Of course it is.

203
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,227
He's worried they'll take our passports.

204
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,817
We're his family and we're Jews.

205
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:26,779
%%%But not proper ones&&&Exactly.

206
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:31,113
%%%What about school?&&&And heimpi?

207
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,370
I'll take care of the houseuntil we all know what's going on.

208
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,451
If the Nazis win,then you'll come and join us.

209
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:40,251
You're packing all this for no reason.

210
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,128
Two weeks from now,we'll all be visiting the zoo again.

211
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,669
Julius, those are first editions.

212
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,967
Some are signed.Can you take them?

213
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:53,056
%%%I'll guard them with my life&&&Thank you.

214
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,764
%%%If Hitler wins, when will we come back?&&&Nobody knows.

215
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,270
%%%Maybe in a month, maybe two or three&&&Three months?

216
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,646
No school for three months?

217
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,851
I don't know yet!

218
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,362
The most important thingis that we don't argue.

219
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,990
Secondly, we have to pack.Two books and one toy, and that's it.

220
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,368
And thirdly, don't get sick.

221
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:17,997
And I'll say this again.We're not telling anybody our plan.

222
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,795
You both have a secret to keep now.That's a very grownup thing.

223
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,835
This is tough.

224
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,051
I love all of you.

225
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:38,184
If I take Terri,the rabbit will be sad.

226
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,187
And if I take the rabbit,Terri will be sad.

227
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,808
They're stuffed animals,they don't have feelings.

228
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,194
It's a shamewe can't take the board games.

229
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,776
I only just got them this Christmas.

230
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:55,239
I got Terri this Christmas too.

231
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,950
%%%Then take it with you&&&But I've had the rabbit for so long.

232
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,082
You're too oldfor stuffed animals anyway.

233
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,534
Leave your drawing pencils hereand you could take both.

234
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,361
No way!

235
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,871
All right, Anna, lights out.

236
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,407
I can't choose, heimpi.

237
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,872
I love them both.

238
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,751
If I leave one behind,they won't understand.

239
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,338
Listen to me.

240
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,303
After you leave tomorrow,

241
00:16:56,474 --> 00:17:01,138
I'll pack another suitcase,an extra one.

242
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:02,552
I'll put your rabbit in thereand some nice books

243
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,938
and the board games.

244
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,183
When I know where you are,I'll send it to you.

245
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,398
All right?

246
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,031
You could just bring it with youwhen you come.

247
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,117
Say it, heimpi.

248
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,700
Good night, dear Anna.Good night, dear Max.

249
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,829
Sleep well, sweet dreams

250
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,331
and goodbye until tomorrow.

251
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,968
Goodbye, heimpi.

252
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:53,687
Goodbye, heimpi.

253
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,984
It's a bit unfair that you can takeyour whole huge opera

254
00:17:56,784 --> 00:18:00,572
and we're only allowed one toy.

255
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,408
Nothing is unfair.I worked on that opera for two years.

256
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,829
Go and get dressed.

257
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,541
Goodbye, office.

258
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,250
Goodbye, round dining table.

259
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,301
Goodbye, grand piano!

260
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,885
Goodbye, dear heimpi kitchen.

261
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,106
Goodbye, lovely old house.

262
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,984
Where is he?

263
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,523
Heimpi,could you take a look in the house?

264
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,902
%%%Yes&&&Thanks.

265
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,493
Good morning!

266
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,121
Off on a trip?So early in the morning?

267
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,707
My husband is so sick

268
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,507
that I'm sending the kidsto stay with family.

269
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,670
Then he won't be able to vote on Sunday.

270
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,683
No, I don't think he will.

271
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,146
%%%Morning, Mrs. lambeck&&&Morning, Max.

272
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,727
%%%Where have you been?&&&I had to say bye to Gunther.

273
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,192
You what?

274
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,537
Unbelievable. Come on, get in.

275
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,828
See you soon, miss heimpel.

276
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,257
See you soon, Mrs. kemper.

277
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,630
Take care.

278
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,180
Go on, get in.

279
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,727
For going to sleep.

280
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,440
Heimpi.

281
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,691
Anna.

282
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:30,473
Max.

283
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:36,607

Since leipzig there have been150@@

288
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,663
Couldn't think of anything more stupid?

289
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,716
I have nothing left to read.I finished everything.

290
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:07,380
"Famous people".

291
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,302
You both must stay very quietat the Swiss border.

292
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:15,347
%%%Why?&&&Do you promise?

293
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,849
If they ask,say we're vacationing for a few days.

294
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,152
%%%But we're@@&&&No buts!

295
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:29,160
I have a strange feeling.

296
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:49,631
Don't worry.Keep your mouth shut and we'll be okay.

297
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,226
It seems like every famous personhad a very difficult childhood.

298
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,016
I fear that we won't ever be famous.

299
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:05,821
I et's wait and see.

300
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,696
Papa!

301
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,574
Everything's okay, honey.We're nearly at the border.

302
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:13,912
Good morning. Passports, please.

303
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,120
Max.

304
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,747
%%%Morning&&&Where are you headed?

305
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,459
To Zurich.

306
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,331
We're visiting relatives.

307
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,667
Don't you have school?

308
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,925
Somebody passed away.

309
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:39,899
Kemper.

310
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,017
Kemper.

311
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,358
The name is familiar to me.

312
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:50,491
Where do I know it from?

313
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,109
I don't know.It's not an unusual name.

314
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,452
Yes, it is.

315
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:58,245
I'll be wracking my brains all day.

316
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:02,961
Have a good trip, madame.

317
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:09,043
Goodbye.

318
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,841
Max, please get me a towel.

319
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,517
Passports, please.

320

%%%Morning&&&Good morning.

Young lady?

323
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,825
Can I see your face?

324
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,660
You look a little feverish.

325
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,699
I have a cold.

326
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,379
We say "the sniffles" here.

327
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,871
%%%Welcome to Switzerland, madame&&&Thank you.

328

Thank you.

329
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,020
You're burning up.

330
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,272
I was so scared.

331
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,485
I know.

332
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,036
Max.

333
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,380
Golden swan hotel, hello.

334
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,292
Hello.

335
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,839
This is my wife.Welcome, Mrs. kemper.

336
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:23,389
Look. We can send this to heimpi.

337
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,022
Mama?

338
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,226
%%%I'm so thirsty@@&&&Honey!

339
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:32,941
Anna?

340
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,959
What is it? Anna"?

341
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,719
Young lady?

342
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:03,927
Can you hear me?

343
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,345
She's in a bad way.Her temperature is over 104.

344
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:15,438
That can leadto inflammation of the brain.

345
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:17,527
%%%Where can I get it?&&&One pharmacy is open until midnight.

346
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,362
%%%Is it far?&&&No.

347
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,870
Arthur.

348
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,341
Heimpi must come.

349
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,631
So, Anna?

350
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,392
What's wrong?

351
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,060
Heimpi.

352
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,194
Blow, Anna.

353
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,905
Hey, little man. Are you awake?

354
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:12,457
My throat hurts.

355
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,998
The national socialistshave won 288 seats.

356
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,801
Just like I said, 43.9 percent.

357
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,132
Hitler will form a coalition.

358
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,551
The Germans have lost their minds.

359
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,304
So what do we do now?

360
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,821
Aren't we going back to Berlin?

361
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,289
That's way too cold!

362
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:53,744
You're back!

363
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,459
I'm hungry.

364
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,251
You can have anything you want.Anything at all.

365
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,295
Anything!

366
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:15,019
My love.

367
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,862
Now I'm glad that you didn't die.

368
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,699
Was there an elephantin this room recently?

369
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,110
Yes, there was.He sat in the chair reading to you.

370
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,580
Don't you remember?

371
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,951
Strange. It seemed so real.

372
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,703
Are you strong enoughfor another little trip?

373
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,506
Where are we going now?

374
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,166
We have to move.This hotel is too expensive.

375
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:43,552
So we're not going home yet?

376
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:48,849
Nope.

377
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:54,601
Hitler didn't win the election,but he got a majority.

378
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,431
%%%We can't go back yet&&&We're going to the countryside.

379
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,887
Mom, they're here!

380
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,399
They're here!

381
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,934
Welcome to the zwirn guesthouse.

382
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,936
Hello there.

383
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:46,448
Hello. I'm Franz.

384
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,618
Hello. I'm vreneli.This is my little sister, Trudi.

385
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,697
Hello.

386
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,408
It's empty now, but in summerthe guests mostly sit outside.

387
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:02,251
The lights are on then.

388
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:07,261
%%%In the summer I'll go swimming&&&If you ever learn how, you dummy!

389
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:12,133
You'll join my class at school tomorrow,won't you?

390
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,113
Max will go to high schoolin sils with Franz.

391
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,322
Watch out, it's hot.

392
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,742
Yummy.

393
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,202
Got everything you need?

394
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,117
Potatoes, beer?

395
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,499
Pickles?

396
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,006
Enjoy your meal.

397
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,251
It smells like old socks.

398
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,421
Stop complaining and eat up.

399
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,761
%%%But heimpi would@@&&&Heimpi isn't here.

400
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:59,437
This is Switzerland.

401
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:07,146
If you carry on dreaming of Germany,you'll miss wonderful new things.

402
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:11,025
Look, mama likes it.

403
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,046
She loves it.

404
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,094
It's silly that I took the dog.

405
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:38,260
I miss my rabbit.

406
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,229
Stop going on about your animals.We have other problems.

407
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,099
We do? Like what?

408
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,777
You're so immature sometimes.

409
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,896
In Berlin I was more betterin school than you.

410
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,191
Not "more better".

411
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:55,406
Your illness cost us a pretty penny.

412
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,445
We were in that expensive hotelfor three weeks.

413
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,955
I was sick for three weeks?

414
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,574
Yes, you were.

415
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,579
The doctor wasn't cheap either.

416
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,256
What day is it today?

417
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,218
%%%What's that?&&&A calendar.

418
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,132
I'll cross the days off one by oneuntil we go home.

419
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,100
Then have fun drawing crosses.

420
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:22,938
Mama said three months@@

421
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,601
If papa can't sell articles,you'll end up in a home.

422
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:42,658
You liar!

423
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:19,328
I hope they have something otherthan melted cheese.

424
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,788
This is Anna from Germany.The refugee. She's in our class now.

425
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,873
Welcome, Anna.

426
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:27,119
Now, listen to me.

427
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:32,132
Anna is from Germanyand doesn't understand our language.

428
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,875
We will all have to talkvery slowly and clearly.

429
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,718
I'm Mr. graupe.

430
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,132
I'm from rapperswil.

431
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,177
And you?

432
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,439
Hello. Berlin.

433
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,484
You can sit at the back next to rosi.

434
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,609
Quiet! How is she meant to know?

435
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:02,909
Ready? We're going to yodel again.

436
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,416
What did I do wrong?

437
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:10,044
Only boys are allowedto walk down the middle.

438
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,098
Girls walk down the side.

439
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,560
Arthur!

440
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,314
Careful!

441
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,149
Not so fast.

442
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,234
It's a piece of cake!

443
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,741
So is Chinese when you can speak it.

444
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,074
%%%At home papa knew how to do everything&&&Hey!

445
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,592
Those days are over.

446
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:00,632
Uncle Julius?

447
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,055
Uncle Julius!

448
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:15,061
What are you doing here?

449
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,326
I was at a conference in bolzanoand thought I'd drop by!

450
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,995
They came one day after the election,as you predicted.

451
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:36,290
They wantedto confiscate your passports.

452
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:40,632
But heimpi was brave.

453
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,215
She said she didn't know where you were,and she chased them off.

454
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,132
Good old heimpi.

455
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,221
You saw heimpi? Is she well?Yes.

456
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,353
She asked me to help her.

457
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:54,266
With what?

458
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,070
Last Tuesday they came with a truckand picked up your things.

459
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,569
What?

460
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:02,073
The piano too?

461
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,907
They took it all.

462
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,663
The big brown suitcase?

463
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:12,205
I don't know,but they took everything

464
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:15,587
and said it will be in storageuntil you return.

465
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,965
All I have is the box of first editions.

466
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:22,051
At least you have that.That's good.

467
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:24,846
%%%I can sell them for you if you want&&&No way.

468
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,263
Never.

469
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:32,395
Could you go and get the suitcase?

470
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,276
%%%It has toys inside. We need them!&&&This isn't about your toys.

471
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,984
My rabbit was in that suitcase.

472
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,948
They burned your books too, you know.

473
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,625
Burned by that filthy mob?I take that as a compliment.

474
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,586
Would you like a piece?

475
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,212
Thanks.

476
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:02,004
I like Terri.

477
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,214
He's much prettier than that old rabbit.

478
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,889
Maybe Hitler is playingone of my board games right now.

479
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:23,196
I hope he's nice to my rabbit.

480
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,856
Tucholsky has been silentsince the book burning.

481
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:30,404
I think he's depressed in exile.

482
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,914
The Nazis revoked his citizenship.He's not coming back.

483
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,041
Can you write here?

484
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,875
Yes. That's not the problem.

485
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,173
It's just difficult to publish my work.

486
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,676
Why?

487
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:48,179
Switzerland worriesthat publishing a critic of the Nazis

488
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:53,013
would make them lose their neutrality.

489
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:57,852
And I think they're scared themselves.

490
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,729
They think their little countryhas got too many Jewish intellectuals.

491
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:10,193
Are you making enough money?

492
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,821
I'll try and changethe publishers' minds.

493
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:17,910
%%%Can I touch her?&&&She's afraid of strangers.

494
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,043
You have to be careful.No fast movements.

495
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,840
You're safe here.

496
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:31,051
%%%That's the main thing&&&I'm not sure.

497
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,970
Maybe I shouldn't have left.Germany needs our voices.

498
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:39,810
Are you joking?

499
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:45,653
Remember professor teitelbaum?

500
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:49,157
They took him from the universitystraight to the camp.

501
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,492
Those swines put him in a dog kennel,

502
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,074
attached to an iron chain.

503
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,581
He had to crawl on all fours

504
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,993
and eat his food out of a dog bowl.

505
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:05,166
He slept chained up on the floorof a wooden hut.

506
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:08,547
He had to bark every timesomeone went in or out of the camp

507
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,763
or they'd beat him with sticks.

508
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,564
The chain was so shortthat he couldn't stand.

509
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:55,932
He took his own life after two months.

510
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,348
There's a small, warm lightburning in your heart, Anna.

511
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:04,315
Protect it.

512
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,196
Don't let it be extinguishedby anyone or anything.

513
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,821
We have to keep believing in good.That's important.

514
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,757
Good will always win.

515
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,469
Can you blow this openfor me again?

516
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,844
I don't believe it anymore.

517
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,475
You're pressing the button.

518
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:04,034
Oh. I have to go.

519
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,643
Julius, take care.

520
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,771
Chop-chop. Off to bed.

521
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:33,029
Thank you.

522
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,273
Sleep well, sweet dreams

523
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,782
and goodbye until tomorrow.

524
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,661
Good night.

525
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,628
Night.

526
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:09,190
Michel, what did I tell you?

527
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,614
%%%What are you looking at?&&&Nothing. I'm just looking.

528
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:23,704
Look at that.Reto can't do it at all.

529
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:27,200
%%%Can't do what?&&&Cartwheels.

530
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,993
%%%Even I can do them better&&&Who cares?

531
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,333
Boys are dummies anyway.

532
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,752
You need more power.

533
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,846
You have to stretch your legs like this.

534
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,937
Got it? Yes.

535
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,354
It's easy. You can do it.Just don't forget your legs.

536
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,996
"You need more power"!

537
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,392
There you go!

538
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,598
Vreneli, what's up?You know full well.

539
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:31,640
I don't! Please tell me.

540
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:35,026
One thing is for sure.

541
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:40,489
Everyone saw your underwear.

542
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,159
You are the dummies now.

543
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,171
They're coming!

544
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,626
What was that?

545
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,380
Just keep going.

546
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,638
What are you doing?

547
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,683
Anna, stop it.

548
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:13,894
Come on, Anna.

549
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:35,161
I'm warning you now.If you throw all of those@@

550
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:38,624
Help!

551
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:41,292
Mama! Mama, help!

552
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:45,304
%%%Mamal!&&&What's going on?

553
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:48,011
What is all this?Reto! What's going on?

554
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:51,261
No! Reto!

555
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,725
I won't let you go until you tell me.

556
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,607
Out with it! Tell me!

557
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,772
%%%This is just what we do&&&What's that?

558
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:02,655
Throw stones at people?

559
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:03,940
Because we love her.We did it because we love her!

560
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,164
What?

561
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,831
Because they love you.

562
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,750
When they love someonethey throw things at them.

563
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:25,298
You should feel honored.

564
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,557
%%%Okay, then&&&If that's what you do here.

565
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:35,725
Watch out, something's coming!

566
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,057
Thanks, vrenel.

567
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,355
For what?

568
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:48,026
Being my friend.

569
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:51,199
We're happy you were bornand that it's your birthday today

570
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:54,790
we love you and give you gifts

571
00:45:55,044 --> 00:46:00,380
food and fun and games

572
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,347
we're happy that you were bornand that it's your birthday today

573
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:15,015
"Dear Anna,

574
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:20,725
Theodor and I wish youa very happy and sunny day"

575
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:23,103
"The elephant baby isn't a baby anymore,but more like an elementary schooler"

576
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,565
"Best wishes to aunt Alice,from uncle Julius"

577
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:29,988
%%%Who is aunt Alice?&&&He probably means me.

578
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:43,130
He didn't write my namebecause of the Nazis.

579
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,338
Thank you! It's lovely.I'll put it with uncle Julius' elephant.

580
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:50,338
When I was ten, I got a bike.

581
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:54,680
Better days will come.

582
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:56,685
We're going on a steamboat touron lake Zurich this afternoon.

583
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:59,393
Really? Yes.

584
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:01,186
It's organizedby the Swiss literary society.

585
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,812
I see.

586
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:09,565
%%%Will there be other kids?&&&Unlikely.

587
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:12,861
There'll be journalists and publishers.It could be important for us.

588
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:14,654
Anna, come quickly!Someone from Germany is on the phone.

589
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,744
For me? Yes.

590
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:24,872
Hello?

591
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:26,051
Anna, is that you?

592
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:30,762
Heimpi!

593
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,922
Anna, I wish youthe most wonderful birthday.

594
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:37,059
Heimpi, I'm ten now!

595
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:39,015
I know, my dear.That's really and truly incredible.

596
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,226
But you don't have to shout.

597
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,392
I'm not your little Anna anymore.

598
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,435
No.

599
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:51,107
You're ten now.

600
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,277
Are you all doing well?

601
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,950
Get out of here. Go.

602
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,705
We're eating cake.

603
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,412
Ask how she got the number.

604
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:03,328
Papa got me a goat.

605
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:05,462
A goat? Do you have a garden?

606
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:07,419
Where did you get our number?

607
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,337
From Mr. Julius.

608
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:12,257
He gave it to me.

609
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:17,383
Switzerland is beautiful, heimpi.Please come soon!

610
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:22,980
I can't, my sweet child.

611
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:27,647
I've got a new jobwith another family.

612
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:31,401
Take care of yourselves, all right?

613
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:37,988
Heimpi, say something.

614
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:39,955
%%%The 20 pfennig is nearly gone&&&We're taking a steamboat on the lake!

615
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:42,117
Really?

616
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:45,620
%%%Hello, Mrs. heimpel&&&Hello from us.

617
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:50,090
%%%Let me talk to heimpi&&&Has your mother learned to cook?

618
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,001
Boys and girls are separated at school.Everything's different than Berlin.

619
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:57,799
Anna@@

620
00:48:57,977 --> 00:49:00,263
Even though you're ten now,you'll always be my little girl.

621
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:09,189
I will never forget Max and@@

622
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:12,980
Now she's gone.

623
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:30,582
And she found a new family.

624
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:37,839
You've invited me here to talkas a writer and theater critic,

625
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:43,686
Nobody goes into exile for fun.

626
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:46,393
You love the place where you werea child, the people and the language.

627
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:49,229
I always thoughtit was absurd to be a critic,

628
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:54,697
if criticize was all you ever did.

629
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:59,990
A year ago, German theaterwas blossoming, varied and rich.

630
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:04,365
Today it is wanting,distorted and hollow.

631
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:07,455
It is my job to assessits current state,

632
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:11,589
even from my place in exile.

633
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:15,251
My radio addresses and new writingsare met with hatred in Germany.

634
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:35,820
But I can't stop myself from thinking.

635
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:39,783
This must bethe most boring birthday you ever had.

636
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:44,121
In Berlin my friends would be visiting.

637
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,577
And heimpi would make strawberry cake.

638
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,373
Did you at least sell an article?

639
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:57,001
It doesn't work that fast, Anna.

640
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:06,723
But I had a few good talks.

641
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,012
Know what?You're not ten years old yet.

642
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:13,310
Why not?

643
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:21,696
You were born at 6:05 on June 14th 1923in charlottenburg hospital.

644
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:24,278
I was at the tavern next doorsharing meatballs with your brother Max.

645
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:27,914
We were very nervous.

646
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:38,418
The tavern next door?Max was only three then.

647
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:48,306
I never imagined your tenth birthdaywould be on a boat in Switzerland.

648
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,971
Isn't it dangerousto keep criticizing Hitler?

649
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:54,600
The Nazis could find us here too.

650
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:58,737
I don't want to be fearful, Anna.

651
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,284
And anyway, we're already on the run.

652
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:05,820
Don't you mind being a refugee?

653
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:11,333
I do.

654
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,289
But I find it interesting too.Who knows where we'll be when you're 11.

655
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:15,754
Or when you're 127

656
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:30,720
at home?

657
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,852
I can't earn any money here.The Swiss won't give me work.

658
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:37,143
I think we'll haveto move on to another country.

659
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:41,025
%%%Where?&&&Maybe Paris.

660
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,488
There's a Jewish paperI could write for.

661
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:48,371
Paris?Max and I would have to learn French.

662
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:54,243
So what?You've a clever head on your shoulders.

663
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:00,674
I don't think I've got usedto being a refugee.

664
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,011
Am I ten now?

665
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:16,356
Yes. It's exactly 6:05.

666
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:19,360
At least it meansthat Max and I can be famous one day.

667
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,401
We'll certainly havea difficult childhood now.

668
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:28,653
See? There's good in everything.

669
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,079
%%%Can you manage ten days alone?&&&Sure.

670
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:36,126
Right, little man?

671
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,287
If we like Parisand find an apartment,

672
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:42,045
we might come back earlier.

673
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:45,002
Tonight we're havingrosti with sausages.

674
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,714
Listen to Mrs. zwirnand do what she says.

675
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:52,218
She'll come inand turn out the lights at night.

676
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,434
And you'll behave yourselves, okay?

677
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,313
I'll write you a postcard every day.

678
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,854
Thank you.

679
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:07,149
While your mother and I are in Paris,

680
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,033
you two will be representingour family in Switzerland.

681
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,944
That's a big responsibility.

682
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,705
Why?

683
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:21,250
Because we Jews live scatteredaround the world

684
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,549
and the Nazis are spreadingterrible lies about us.

685
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,594
So it's very importantfor people like us

686
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,593
to prove that they are wrong.

687
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,342
How do we do that?

688
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,977
By being more honest than others,

689
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:39,060
more hard-working,generous and polite.

690
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,309
We have to show peoplethat it's good to be Jewish.

691
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:45,480
I'm sure that when we get back

692
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,532
we'll be very proudof how you represented us.

693
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,281
%%%Take good care of the hat, Anna&&&I will.

694
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:58,492
And you, Max,

695
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,376
take good care of Anna.

696
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:13,382
See you.

697
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:16,852
%%%You're definitely coming back?&&&Of course we are!

698
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:19,138
Don't forget to come and get us.Don't forget us!

699
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,602
Anna, are you crazy?

700
00:55:56,311 --> 00:56:00,054
I'd never forget my children!

701
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:03,395
Stop eating so much, vali.You're getting heavier.

702
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:07,107
If I don't eat, I get dizzy.I'm dizzy already.

703
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:18,079
Nearly there, vali.You can do it!

704
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:26,668
Hey, no fighting!

705
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:29,462
Hey, Anna.

706
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:32,548
Your dad was in the paper today.

707
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,338
Really?So he finally sold an article.

708
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,181
No, it wasn't that.

709
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:40,344
It said they're looking for him.

710
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:42,562
Adolf Hitler has even puta price on his head.

711
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:47,230
1000 reichsmark.

712
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:49,983
But don't worry.

713
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,273
Hitler can't touch him here.

714
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:12,084
He's safe here in Switzerland.

715
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:16,505
Scared of the new school?

716
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,139
Of the language maybe.But I managed to understand you.

717
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:19,766
I speak German though.

718
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:24,722
More or less.

719
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:28,108
Those two over thereare from Germany too.

720
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,814
I know.But they don't play with me.

721
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:39,494
They're Nazis.

722
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:41,405
Is it bad to play with them?

723
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:46,168
No.

724
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:04,394
It's bad that they can go back to Berlinin two weeks and I can't.

725
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,937
Wake up! "What is it?

726
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:12,444
It's empty.

727
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:22,947
It doesn't smell of anything anymore.

728
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:30,500
No, Anna, I'm sorry.There was no postcard today.

729
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:32,710
Nothing.

730
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,546
We'll probably get three tomorrow.

731
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,397
Write about your hike.They'll like that.

732
00:58:56,575 --> 00:59:01,194
Why put a price on someone's head, Max?"What?

733
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:08,325
Mr. graupe said that Hitlerhad put a price on papa's head.

734
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:10,835
It's when you promise someone a rewardfor finding someone else.

735
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,877
We already knewHitler's looking for him.

736
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:30,147
Anyhow, I wish papa was here now.

737
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,023
Good morning.I wish you all a wonderful day.

738
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:34,820
Thank you.

739
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:43,406
Come on.

740
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,822
That was very brave.Think they realized you were teasing?

741
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:52,160
I wasn't.I was trying to be extra polite.

742
00:59:53,465 --> 00:59:55,205
Go around. Go on!

743
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:57,123
Go on! You can't get me.

744
00:59:57,302 --> 01:00:00,009
Yes, I will. Don't you worry.

745
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,094
Help me! The thief is too fast!

746
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:09,390
Go!

747
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:11,104
Papa, I was so scared for your head!

748
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,686
My head?

749
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:17,398
Because Hitler put a price on it.

750
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:20,189
I was a little worried about that too.Hello, you.

751
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:24,076
Really? Yes.

752
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:27,363
1000 Mark is pretty cheapfor someone like me, don't you think?

753
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:28,906
I'm tempted to write Hitlera formal complaint.

754
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:31,325
Where is mama?

755
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:33,039
She's in Paris,fixing up our apartment.

756
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:36,037
Our apartment? Yes.

757
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,209
It has a balcony and a kitchen.

758
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:43,845
I'll do the rest. It's too heavy.

759
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:47,132
There's a whole cheese in there.

760
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:52,847
%%%And sausages, bread and boiled eggs&&&Thank you.

761
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:55,140
%%%Something to drink on the road&&&Thank you.

762
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:03,406
Kids, get down.

763
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:06,364
Take good care.You're always welcome here.

764
01:01:06,872 --> 01:01:08,237
Thank you, Mrs. zwirn.For everything.

765
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:10,997
Goodbye.

766
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:13,079
%%%Franz&&&Goodbye.

767
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:25,800
Where is Anna"?

768
01:01:26,975 --> 01:01:28,966
I'm sad that you're leaving.You're my best friend.

769
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:33,187
Aren't you sad too?

770
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,597
Yes, I am.But as a refugee you often say goodbye.

771
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:38,107
It's part of my difficult childhood.

772
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:40,394
Anna, come on! We have to go.

773
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,196
Look what I've been practicing.

774
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:56,118
Great, vreneli!

775
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,705
Goodbye, narrow alleys.

776
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,551
Goodbye, big rock.

777
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:24,362
Goodbye, old watering hole.

778
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:27,319
Goodbye, dummy!

779
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,260
Bye, Anna.

780
01:02:57,065 --> 01:02:58,930
Look.

781
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:06,150
It's the Eiffel Tower.

782
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:10,950
The man who built itwasn't called eiffel, but bonickhausen.

783
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:12,952
The French couldn't pronounce itso they called him eiffel,

784
01:03:14,249 --> 01:03:16,080
because he was from the eifel area.

785
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,906
They can't pronounce that either.

786
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:59,540
I thought it was yellow.

787
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:03,833
Why?

788
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,627
%%%Because papa said it has a balcony&&&So it had to be yellow?

789
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,589
A nice color, at least.

790
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:15,636
Press the button.

791
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:17,179
Good evening, professor.

792
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:20,683
Good evening.

793
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,680
So@@these are your kids?

794
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,066
Yes, this is Max and Anna.

795
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:28,482
How cute. Evening, little one.

796
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,855
I bought you some candy.

797
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,200
Come here, Fifi!

798
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:35,531
Thanks.

799
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:37,867
%%%You're welcome&&&Thanks.

800
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,536
Wait a moment.

801
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:44,043
Please sign here.

802
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:46,542
%%%What is it?&&&The authorization.

803
01:04:47,759 --> 01:04:49,420
%%%What authorization?&&&Mine, of course.

804
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:53,545
So that everything is in order.

805
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:57,261
Perfect.

806
01:04:57,519 --> 01:04:59,100
%%%Do we have an elevator?&&&Is that because we're rich now?

807
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,611
Come on.

808
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:16,651
%%%My darlings!&&&Mamal

809
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:20,038
yes!

810
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,747
%%%You're finally here!&&&I missed you so much.

811
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,832
Mrs. zwirn gave us a wholechocolate cake to take with us.

812
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:33,384
%%%Hello&&&Hello, sir.

813
01:05:33,555 --> 01:05:35,045
Come on in.

814
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:38,807
I wonder what it's like.

815
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:45,013
This is your room, the yellow one.

816
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:48,892
Yellow is such a nice, happy color.

817
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:51,186
Why is it so dark in here?

818
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:54,071
You have this nice little lamp.

819
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:58,660
%%%It's not so bad&&&Come into the living room.

820
01:05:58,830 --> 01:06:00,161
It's the kitchen too.

821
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:10,881
Nice.

822
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:14,759
%%%This is what you called a balcony?&&&Yes. For me, this is a balcony.

823
01:06:15,013 --> 01:06:16,844
%%%Who used to live here?&&&The servants.

824
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:23,009
It's cozy.

825
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,474
Is this your room, papa?

826
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:31,734
Yes.

827
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,146
This is my office.

828
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:37,819
And the bathroom?

829
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,110
The toilet is in the stairwell.

830
01:06:40,288 --> 01:06:43,451
We share it with the neighbor.

831
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:45,206
I'll give you a bowl of warm waterto wash with.

832
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:47,162
Who is our neighbor?

833
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:50,420
She's called grete.

834
01:06:51,466 --> 01:06:53,502
She's a girl from Austria.

835
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:57,798
She's here to learn French.

836
01:06:58,056 --> 01:06:59,341
She's a little@@strange,but she speaks German.

837
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:02,053
Is she Jewish too?

838
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:06,394
%%%The potatoes!&&&Unlikely.

839
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:08,270
%%%Oh, no&&&Where will you sleep?

840
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,776
I'll show you something.

841
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:17,110
Max, help me out.Take a hold and pull.

842
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:19,114
Come on. And voila.

843
01:07:21,329 --> 01:07:23,285
A magic sofa!

844
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:26,289
Watch out. There we go.

845
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:30,122
%%%I burned everything&&&It's okay.

846
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:33,955
We have one more roomthan we did at the zwirns.

847
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,258
I thought it would be nicer.

848
01:07:40,682 --> 01:07:42,593
Me too.

849
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:45,429
I tried my best.

850
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:49,391
But the stove here is hard to control.

851
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:51,810
The egg tastes good.

852
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,148
But the potatoes are a little dark.

853
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:55,477
Burned.

854
01:07:56,531 --> 01:07:57,691
It doesn't matter.

855
01:07:57,865 --> 01:08:00,698
Try this.

856
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:03,075
You can live wonderfullyon cheese, baguette and wine.

857
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:06,496
Baguette?

858
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:09,915
It's French for "stick".

859
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:15,459
Give me that.

860
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:19,418
Hey, not too much.

861
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:25,006
I think it's gone bad.

862
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:27,179
%%%It's moldy already&&&It's a Saint maure.

863
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:29,969
Goats cheese rolled in ash.

864
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:32,930
Every place we end up,there's old cheese.

865
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:35,975
Seems so.

866
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:38,270
I drink to our family

867
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:40,279
and to our future in this city.

868
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:43,737
Cheers.

869
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:49,246
That sounded@@very fluent.

870
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:02,005
%%%Cheers&&&Cheers.

871
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:03,795
Can you swim in this river?

872
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,805
Yes, but not here.

873
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,431
The river is called the seine.

874
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,982
Come on.

875
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,393
Seine@@hello@@cheers.

876
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:32,620
I already know these three wordsin French.

877
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:35,539
We can't allow our reviews

878
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:38,960
to harm emigrated German artists.

879
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:41,340
Our reviews are seriousbut not scathing.

880
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:43,585
We request you to be tactful.

881
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:49,432
You were Berlin's most-feared critic.

882
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:52,223
It's not in my interestto make life hard for my fellow Germans.

883
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:54,103
I much prefer giving praisethan giving scorn.

884
01:09:55,483 --> 01:09:58,065
Really?

885
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:00,435
Would you be preparedto write for us once a week

886
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:05,614
about the Parisian theater scene?

887
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:09,657
I'd love to do even more.

888
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:11,450
We'd like to give you more,but we can't afford it.

889
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:43,777
Culture is a luxury now.

890
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:47,065
Finally!

891
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:51,448
%%%How was it?&&&Good. Papa has work.

892
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:54,364
Really?

893
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,502
%%%That's mine&&&Can I have one too?

894
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:03,294
Are we eating here? I'm hungry.

895
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:06,501
One review a week for 15 francs.That's 60 francs a month.

896
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:08,549
Can I get you anything?

897
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,130
How will we live on that?

898
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:15,889
No, thanks. We're going.

899
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:24,190
Let your sister have some.

900
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:27,070
%%%All we have at home is bread and@@&&&Cheese.

901
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:28,981
We'll get butter and eggson the way home.

902
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,697
Eggs again?

903
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:33,736
Yes, eggs again.

904
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,046
Come on, let's go.

905
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:52,468
I left this half for you.

906
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:54,382
%%%Max?&&&I need a new schoolbag, a French one.

907
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,643
And long pants.

908
01:11:57,814 --> 01:12:01,306
%%%I see&&&How was it with the other boys?

909
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:06,899
No idea.I didn't understand a word all day.

910
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:10,110
How can I make new friendswhen I don't speak this stupid language?

911
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:18,702
The best way to learn a languageis through the music.

912
01:12:22,547 --> 01:12:23,878
Stop it. You're embarrassing me.

913
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:29,208
Come on.

914
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:40,353
Anna, come!

915
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:43,222
%%%Can't you stay on your side?&&&Why do you need so much space?

916
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:46,859
I can't concentrate with you scribbling.

917
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:49,645
%%%Then go somewhere else&&&I have to study.

918
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:52,614
%%%Draw your stupid pictures on the floor&&&Max.

919
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:54,780
It's unfairthat Max can go to school and I can't.

920
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:57,696
One private school is enough expense.

921
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,786
Then I'll go to a non-private school.

922
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,121
That's where very simple peoplesend their kids.

923
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:06,041
We're simple people too now.

924
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:11,426
They don't even teach Latin there.

925
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:13,086
We might be poor,but your education comes first.

926
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:15,095
Now what?

927
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:18,599
I have to concentrate.

928
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:20,851
I wish I had a sister.

929
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:36,650
I wish I didn't.

930
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,444
Am I also too loud?

931
01:13:39,874 --> 01:13:42,661
It's okay.

932
01:13:43,878 --> 01:13:45,368
Can I stay with you for a while?

933
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:54,385
Did you argue again?

934
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:03,219
How are your disasters?

935
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:05,346
Will they all die in the avalanche?

936
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:17,946
I'm afraid so.

937
01:14:24,794 --> 01:14:26,876
Do you have time to goand ask the concierge for the mail?

938
01:14:27,046 --> 01:14:29,082
Anna, did you hear me?

939
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:36,006
Yes, I did.

940
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:38,800
I'm scared of the stairwell.

941
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:44,601
I see.

942
01:14:44,772 --> 01:14:46,512
Okay, I'll come with you this time.

943
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:48,352
But tomorrow you'll do it alone.

944
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:09,585
Good. Come on.

945
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:13,422
%%%Good day, miss grete&&&Good day.

946
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:16,208
Why is she always so strange?

947
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:22,347
I don't knowand I don't want to think about it.

948
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,349
Did you find a jobthat's to your liking

949
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:29,430
Mr. professor kemper?

950
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:31,974
Yes, madame prune,I work for a Paris newspaper.

951
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:34,026
You don't have to worry about the rent.

952
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,652
Pleased to hear it.

953
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:40,524
One of those immigrant papers, is it?

954
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:44,738
Want an olive?

955
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,577
%%%Lots of Jews find work there&&&I hope so.

956
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:53,709
Come on, Anna.

957
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:55,874
Don't forgetthat the rent is due every week.

958
01:15:56,552 --> 01:16:02,297
%%%Fridays!&&&Got it.

959
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:05,387
"Dear Anna, this lovely harereminded me of your pink rabbit.

960
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:08,519
How are you doingin the beautiful city of Paris?

961
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:12,557
Did you alreadytry snails in garlic butter?

962
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:15,442
Aunt Alice gave mesome smart advice a while ago.

963
01:16:15,613 --> 01:16:18,446
Sometimes I thinkthat I should have taken it.

964
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:20,898
Lots of love from uncle Julius"

965
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:23,693
What advice?

966
01:16:25,206 --> 01:16:27,322
Can you really eat snails?

967
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:31,241
He shouldn't have gone back to Germany.

968
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:53,351
I kept telling him.

969
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:57,606
I look terrible.

970
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:05,825
My hair!

971
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:12,533
Where are you going?

972
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,332
Arthur, no!

973
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:21,630
It's far too expensive!

974
01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:24,086
I don't want any. No!

975
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:27,594
Arthur, come back.

976
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:02,925
Stop it!

977
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:05,340
%%%Done!&&&Really? All of the exercises?

978
01:18:20,321 --> 01:18:21,936
%%%Yes, yes&&&I'll be right there.

979
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:30,862
Excellent!

980
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,033
%%%Hello, how can I help you?&&&Hello, madame.

981
01:18:37,338 --> 01:18:39,374
Pencil.

982
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:43,590
I think "madame" is for a woman.

983
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:47,215
That's right.

984
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:49,338
Thank you.

985
01:19:00,027 --> 01:19:02,018
Pencil.

986
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:04,937
Thanks. You're welcome.

987
01:19:08,202 --> 01:19:09,863
Two francs.

988
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:11,777
Thank you very much.

989
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:14,196
And@@goodbye.

990
01:19:15,542 --> 01:19:18,659
Goodbye.

991
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:21,328
There's nothing left?Mama said we could keep the change.

992
01:19:21,507 --> 01:19:23,372
%%%It doesn't matter. Come on&&&It does matter!

993
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:25,791
Cheap, cheap@@

994
01:19:26,303 --> 01:19:28,510
Cheap!

995
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:42,725
Cheap pencil?

996
01:19:46,657 --> 01:19:49,148
Thank you.

997
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:59,291
Yes, yes. Got it.

998
01:20:00,379 --> 01:20:04,543
Thanks. You're welcome.

999
01:20:04,717 --> 01:20:06,548
We have 20 cents now.Think of what we can buy with that!

1000
01:20:07,428 --> 01:20:09,259
Probably not very much.

1001
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:17,635
Goodbye, madame.

1002
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:30,523
I ook at that nutcracker!

1003
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:32,649
It smells like grunewald.

1004
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:34,159
I hope we havea Christmas tree this year.

1005
01:20:35,205 --> 01:20:37,412
Of course!

1006
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:41,542
My dear friend.

1007
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:46,213
Your postcards are rays of lighton an otherwise dark horizon.

1008
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:48,999
You are the only one from back homewhom we hear from.

1009
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:51,840
All of the hauptmanns,einsteins, oldens@@

1010
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:55,302
Where are they now?

1011
01:20:55,476 --> 01:20:56,636
I can't help wonderingif in the past they would have left

1012
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,347
a letter from me unanswered.

1013
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:03,938
Surely not.

1014
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:08,193
I never thought I would write this,

1015
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:15,947
but I'm afraid I must ask you to sella few of our first editions.

1016
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,701
I've had myGerman citizenship taken away.

1017
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:25,661
Now I'm primarily one thing: A Jew.

1018
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:31,091
At least that means we don't belongto the misled masses or the Nazi mob.

1019
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:33,843
And Jews are experienced emigrants.

1020
01:21:34,014 --> 01:21:37,302
And although it's painful,

1021
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:59,403
I'm happy to belong to a peoplewith such rich heritage.

1022
01:22:03,877 --> 01:22:05,833
Papa? I think I have to go up there.

1023
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,385
No, you can sit down here.

1024
01:22:24,982 --> 01:22:27,769
Mr. kemper?

1025
01:22:28,902 --> 01:22:30,312
Mr. kemper?I didn't mean to startle you.

1026
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:32,944
Do you remember me?

1027
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:34,563
I'm afraid I don't.

1028
01:22:35,409 --> 01:22:36,774
Robert Stein.

1029
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:39,321
From the theater.

1030
01:22:39,496 --> 01:22:41,077
Exactly. That's the one.

1031
01:22:41,331 --> 01:22:44,539
Hello.

1032
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:48,786
%%%I didn't know you were in Paris&&&My wife has family here.

1033
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:51,622
There's no more work for me in Berlin.We came a year ago.

1034
01:22:53,343 --> 01:22:55,208
This is my daughter Anna.

1035
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:06,102
%%%Hello, Anna&&&Hello.

1036
01:23:06,356 --> 01:23:09,223
If you're ever there,we live in the 7th arrondissement.

1037
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:13,359
Maybe you and your familycould come over for tea.

1038
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:16,146
Berlin is ancient history now.

1039
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:18,823
I'd love to spend timewith such a brilliant mind.

1040
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:21,492
Thank you.

1041
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:23,403
I'll be in touch.

1042
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:26,205
%%%Goodbye&&&Goodbye.

1043
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:30,252
%%%Goodbye, Anna&&&Bye.

1044
01:23:31,048 --> 01:23:32,333
Papa, don't you like that man?

1045
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:35,674
I have no reason not to.

1046
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:43,924
But I thought he might not like me.

1047
01:23:44,102 --> 01:23:45,342
We bumpedinto Robert Stein at the synagogue.

1048
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:49,722
Robert Stein?

1049
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:52,642
%%%You tore him to pieces a few times&&&Very true.

1050
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:56,186
He's an intensely untalented director.

1051
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:58,063
His productions were unbearable.

1052
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:02,030
I thought he was nice.

1053
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:03,740
It wasn't my job to find outhow nice he was.

1054
01:24:03,914 --> 01:24:06,121
He was bad and that's that.

1055
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:08,536
And if you say so then it must be true.

1056
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:09,909
That's right.

1057
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:14,167
You're so arrogant.

1058
01:24:14,424 --> 01:24:16,289
He didn't seem very resentful.

1059
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:19,460
Wasn't his wife a pianist too?

1060
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:23,672
He invited us to tea.They live in a very fancy area.

1061
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:43,821
Wild horses couldn't drag meto that amateur.

1062
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:45,236
Thank you, mama.

1063
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:46,574
You're welcome.

1064
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:50,408
It's beautiful.

1065
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:53,285
%%%They really did turn out as pullovers&&&Indeed.

1066
01:24:53,463 --> 01:24:55,169
Did somebody doubt they would?

1067
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:03,758
Come here, this is for you.

1068
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:05,927
That's beautiful.

1069
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,471
Show me.

1070
01:25:10,188 --> 01:25:12,429
Flick through with your thumb.

1071
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:13,851
It's amazing. How did you do it?

1072
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:18,401
Max, look.

1073
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:21,901
Not bad, little man!

1074
01:25:25,162 --> 01:25:26,868
I didn't want to give youany more disasters.

1075
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:29,280
Is this a school bag?

1076
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:32,824
Your mother founda public school for you.

1077
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:35,077
I thought those schoolswere bad for people like us.

1078
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:38,630
Who says such nonsense?

1079
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:46,884
That's hard to imagine.

1080
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:50,426
How did you@@

1081
01:25:57,194 --> 01:25:58,934
I didn't steal them, that's for sure.

1082
01:26:03,617 --> 01:26:05,608
Dorothea?

1083
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:09,035
I have something else for you.

1084
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:30,632
So you don't forget who you are.

1085
01:26:31,978 --> 01:26:33,138
Happy Christmas.

1086
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:38,057
Thank you.

1087
01:26:44,574 --> 01:26:45,859
A balloon.

1088
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:49,652
"Dear Anna,

1089
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:52,537
my most heartfelt wishesfor a wonderful Christmas.

1090
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:55,916
Drop this balloon from the Eiffel Tower

1091
01:26:58,004 --> 01:27:01,838
and the west wind is sure to blow itto my front door in Berlin.

1092
01:27:02,008 --> 01:27:04,294
That would make me happy.I look to the new year full of hope.

1093
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:06,425
Things can and must get better.

1094
01:27:12,352 --> 01:27:14,092
On that note@@yours, Julius"

1095
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:15,386
Happy Christmas, miss grete!

1096
01:27:22,821 --> 01:27:25,813
Good evening.

1097
01:27:28,285 --> 01:27:32,369
If we're Jewish,why do we celebrate Christmas?

1098
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:36,073
I see it as a German celebrationrather than a Christian one.

1099
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,541
It reminds meof wonderful family gatherings

1100
01:27:44,468 --> 01:27:46,629
when I was your age.

1101
01:27:48,764 --> 01:27:50,595
Do you believe in god?

1102
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:55,721
I'm afraid not.

1103
01:27:56,980 --> 01:28:00,347
I only believe in gratefulness.

1104
01:28:01,693 --> 01:28:04,730
People who don't feel gratefulalways lose.

1105
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:12,317
I'm very grateful right now,especially for my school bag.

1106
01:28:12,496 --> 01:28:14,327
Where are you from?

1107
01:28:14,998 --> 01:28:17,614
Anna, how long will you stay?

1108
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:20,660
Do you understand?Your skirt is too short.

1109
01:28:20,921 --> 01:28:24,129
Do you have a little sister?Why are you wearing her coat?

1110
01:28:34,059 --> 01:28:36,050
You need a uniform.I'll show you where to get one.

1111
01:28:36,686 --> 01:28:38,927
Napoleon's victories:

1112
01:28:39,105 --> 01:28:41,437
1800 marengo,

1113
01:28:41,608 --> 01:28:43,690
1805 austerlitz,

1114
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:46,560
1806 jena,

1115
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:49,484
1807 friedland,

1116
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:51,982
1809 wagram.

1117
01:28:56,706 --> 01:29:00,324
Very good. You can sit down.

1118
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:04,040
His final defeat was in Waterloo.That was in 1815.

1119
01:29:04,214 --> 01:29:06,330
That's true.Is that all they said about Napoleon?

1120
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:09,375
There are so many interesting things.

1121
01:29:09,553 --> 01:29:11,635
The whole lessonwas just learning the dates.

1122
01:29:11,888 --> 01:29:14,675
%%%Hi, papa. Hi, little man&&&Hello.

1123
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:16,511
%%%How was it?&&&Good. I got my uniform today.

1124
01:29:16,685 --> 01:29:19,051
Understand anything yet?

1125
01:29:19,312 --> 01:29:21,223
%%%No, but math is easy&&&Very good.

1126
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:24,765
That's something at least.

1127
01:29:24,943 --> 01:29:27,059
%%%You look French already&&&Is that good or bad?

1128
01:29:30,532 --> 01:29:32,523
%%%I don't know&&&Hello.

1129
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:36,285
Potato soup again?

1130
01:29:37,247 --> 01:29:39,238
%%%Is there meat in it at least?&&&You ask the same thing every day.

1131
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:42,078
I guess cinema is out of the question?

1132
01:29:42,252 --> 01:29:44,083
It's the first timemy classmates invited me.

1133
01:29:44,254 --> 01:29:46,461
But I bet I can't go, can I?

1134
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:50,465
Okay, then you decide!

1135
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:54,303
Either we have a hot meal tomorrowor you go to the cinema with your pals.

1136
01:29:54,472 --> 01:29:57,464
We can only do one or the other.So, what do we do?

1137
01:29:59,102 --> 01:30:00,683
Will things stay like this for ever?

1138
01:30:01,354 --> 01:30:03,970
They've got us.

1139
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:06,140
%%%The Nazis&&&You silly thing.

1140
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:09,692
It's just the lightbulb.

1141
01:30:13,116 --> 01:30:15,198
Max, you and I will take a walk later.

1142
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:27,244
That's another two francs.

1143
01:30:31,718 --> 01:30:33,299
%%%So you're still hungry&&&I'm always hungry.

1144
01:30:49,152 --> 01:30:52,815
Wait here.

1145
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:57,615
%%%Shouldn't we have bought a lightbulb?&&&Try it, it's good.

1146
01:30:57,786 --> 01:30:59,276
Here, monsieur.

1147
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:24,059
Thank you.

1148
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:26,390
Kids! Tell your dadthe rent was due two days ago.

1149
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:30,023
On Friday.

1150
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:34,398
Was he famous in Germany, your dad?

1151
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:41,117
%%%Are you Jews?&&&Yes, we're Jews.

1152
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:45,322
You're not in Germany anymore.This is Paris. Understood?

1153
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:49,793
Typical!

1154
01:31:49,963 --> 01:31:51,453
Strange people,creeping around like thieves.

1155
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:57,337
Right, Fifi? Jews.

1156
01:31:58,513 --> 01:32:00,128
It's not deep.

1157
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,847
But it's so cold.

1158
01:32:08,273 --> 01:32:09,809
%%%What are you doing?&&&I'm getting in.

1159
01:32:10,608 --> 01:32:12,690
That's not allowed.

1160
01:32:24,456 --> 01:32:26,242
Most of them have gone green anyway.

1161
01:32:28,251 --> 01:32:30,993
This is crazy, Anna.

1162
01:33:10,335 --> 01:33:12,166
Stop staring at me like a dummyand give me a hand.

1163
01:33:12,337 --> 01:33:14,123
Hello, madame batier.

1164
01:33:31,231 --> 01:33:32,562
Hello, girls.

1165
01:33:32,732 --> 01:33:34,893
Light!

1166
01:33:35,151 --> 01:33:37,062
Nobody could have imaginedwhat would become of him.

1167
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:40,812
His mother was called laetitia.

1168
01:33:40,990 --> 01:33:44,448
%%%How did you get the money?&&&Napoleon wanted recognition.

1169
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:47,740
%%%We just took a little dip&&&But she never took him seriously.

1170
01:33:47,914 --> 01:33:50,656
He excelled at school

1171
01:33:50,834 --> 01:33:52,415
and became a leaderat an incredibly young age.

1172
01:33:52,669 --> 01:33:57,208
He won victory after victory,

1173
01:33:57,382 --> 01:34:00,294
was even crowned emperorand made his siblings kings and queens.

1174
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:04,461
But his mother always said,"let's see how long it lasts"

1175
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:08,799
And it didn't turn out well.

1176
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:14,558
Would it have been differentif she'd shown pride in him?

1177
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:18,600
Napoleon is such an interesting topic.

1178
01:34:19,445 --> 01:34:22,903
He always fell for womenwho looked like his mother.

1179
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:24,819
But his motherdidn't like any of them, of course.

1180
01:34:25,618 --> 01:34:27,574
How do you know all this?

1181
01:34:28,746 --> 01:34:32,238
I read up on it again just now.

1182
01:34:33,168 --> 01:34:36,376
%%%I'm doing a script about his childhood&&&For a movie?

1183
01:34:37,755 --> 01:34:39,211
If someone buys it,then it might get made into a movie.

1184
01:34:40,884 --> 01:34:42,340
Good night.

1185
01:34:43,386 --> 01:34:44,842
Good night.

1186
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:47,595
Good night.

1187
01:34:47,765 --> 01:34:51,974
Do you know things about Napoleon?

1188
01:34:52,145 --> 01:34:55,637
Yes, he didn't havea musical bone in his body.

1189
01:34:55,815 --> 01:34:59,933
The only thing he likedwere drums and trumpets.

1190
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,801
But there was a corsican nursery rhymethat he always remembered.

1191
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:36,560
Papa is having nightmares again.

1192
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:38,187
Let me sleep.

1193
01:35:57,752 --> 01:35:59,617
But I'm scared.

1194
01:36:09,055 --> 01:36:11,046
Can't you sleep?

1195
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:15,550
Is grete a Nazi?

1196
01:36:16,854 --> 01:36:19,140
Maybe.

1197
01:36:20,483 --> 01:36:22,940
Perhaps she just doesn't like Jews.

1198
01:36:25,863 --> 01:36:29,105
Like madame prune.

1199
01:36:30,326 --> 01:36:32,157
%%%Will there be food?&&&Certainly. Don't be too loud.

1200
01:36:37,375 --> 01:36:38,375
Be on your best behavior, okay?

1201
01:36:41,421 --> 01:36:45,380
Right.

1202
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:47,381
%%%Mrs. kemper, how lovely&&&Mrs. Stein, thanks for the invitation.

1203
01:36:48,052 --> 01:36:50,919
Come inside.

1204
01:36:51,097 --> 01:36:53,588
I was so pleased to get your call.

1205
01:36:54,976 --> 01:36:56,261
I get so incredibly bored all day.

1206
01:36:56,519 --> 01:36:58,555
Come.

1207
01:37:03,651 --> 01:37:07,564
Hannah, Gustav, our guests are here!

1208
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:10,188
Just because our husbands are immature,it doesn't mean we have to be.

1209
01:37:11,451 --> 01:37:14,318
%%%Isn't that so?&&&Indeed.

1210
01:37:16,331 --> 01:37:18,492
I'm thrilledto have visitors from Berlin.

1211
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:21,283
My husband never meant it personally.

1212
01:37:21,461 --> 01:37:22,746
He loves theater so muchthat sometimes he@@

1213
01:37:23,004 --> 01:37:25,996
Mrs. kemper,

1214
01:37:26,174 --> 01:37:29,666
Robert was incredibly hurtby what your husband wrote,

1215
01:37:30,595 --> 01:37:32,881
but I'm sure that in the endit helped him develop.

1216
01:37:33,139 --> 01:37:35,881
What is your husband working on now?

1217
01:37:37,310 --> 01:37:39,471
He's writing a script about Napoleon.

1218
01:37:39,645 --> 01:37:41,931
He has time right now.

1219
01:37:43,941 --> 01:37:46,057
Napoleon? How interesting.

1220
01:37:46,778 --> 01:37:47,858
You can leave the tableif you're done.

1221
01:37:52,742 --> 01:37:55,199
Thank you.

1222
01:37:56,621 --> 01:37:58,828
I'll show you my room.

1223
01:38:10,510 --> 01:38:13,252
%%%Would you like a liqueur?&&&Certainly.

1224
01:38:13,805 --> 01:38:16,717
Does it suit me?I'll wear it on the golf course.

1225
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:19,974
What a charming idea!You look like a buttercup.

1226
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:23,933
You'll be followedby swarms of butterflies.

1227
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:26,977
And you, my dearest heart,look like a lampshade.

1228
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:29,312
Take whatever you like.We have too much anyway.

1229
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:31,310
If you don't,it'll be donated to the needy.

1230
01:38:31,948 --> 01:38:35,190
We're needy too.

1231
01:38:35,368 --> 01:38:36,983
We also have lots of German booksthat we already read.

1232
01:38:37,829 --> 01:38:39,285
You know how to read, don't you?

1233
01:38:40,456 --> 01:38:44,290
Read?

1234
01:39:25,918 --> 01:39:27,124
What do you mean?Our parents don't believe in education.

1235
01:39:27,879 --> 01:39:30,791
You'll give that all back!

1236
01:39:31,883 --> 01:39:33,714
My kids don't need handouts.Certainly not from that clown!

1237
01:39:34,677 --> 01:39:36,633
We're not beggars!

1238
01:39:37,430 --> 01:39:40,137
Do you know what your kids need?

1239
01:39:40,308 --> 01:39:41,969
They need food and clothes

1240
01:39:42,143 --> 01:39:44,179
and all kinds of things.

1241
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:48,433
And I couldn't care lesswhere we get it.

1242
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:50,348
You're not a famous criticliving in grunewald anymore.

1243
01:39:52,195 --> 01:39:56,029
Those days are over.

1244
01:39:56,199 --> 01:39:58,030
If the clothes were meantfor poor children anyway,

1245
01:39:58,201 --> 01:40:01,034
why not give them to ours?

1246
01:40:02,538 --> 01:40:04,278
I'm not giving these pants back.You don't have to.

1247
01:40:17,303 --> 01:40:19,214
Are we poor now?

1248
01:40:19,388 --> 01:40:21,549
%%%Very good, manon&&&Thank you.

1249
01:40:22,934 --> 01:40:25,141
Anna, 147 mistakes.

1250
01:40:25,311 --> 01:40:28,018
You have to work harder,

1251
01:40:28,272 --> 01:40:29,853
or you won't move up to the next class.

1252
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:37,110
Do you understand?

1253
01:40:37,823 --> 01:40:40,030
Rosalie, good.

1254
01:40:40,201 --> 01:40:41,691
Anna, you have very pretty shoes.

1255
01:40:42,954 --> 01:40:45,787
%%%Catherine, very good&&&Thanks.

1256
01:40:52,213 --> 01:40:56,001
Isabelle, watch your commas.

1257
01:40:56,175 --> 01:40:58,086
A year ago, he lost his jobat the natural history museum.

1258
01:41:00,763 --> 01:41:02,219
I didn't know that.

1259
01:41:03,808 --> 01:41:07,016
Hello.

1260
01:41:07,186 --> 01:41:11,350
This is our daughter Anna.Julius was her godfather.

1261
01:41:11,524 --> 01:41:13,731
Anna, this is heinz rosenfeld,one of Julius's friends.

1262
01:41:14,819 --> 01:41:16,150
%%%From Berlin&&&Hello.

1263
01:41:19,782 --> 01:41:22,319
So, you're Anna.

1264
01:41:23,578 --> 01:41:25,409
Julius didn't want you to worry.

1265
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:30,247
Carry on.

1266
01:41:31,127 --> 01:41:34,745
He was doing fairly wellfor a long while.

1267
01:41:36,465 --> 01:41:40,333
He went to the zoo every dayand visited his animals.

1268
01:41:40,970 --> 01:41:44,554
He did menial workin a cigarette factory twice a week.

1269
01:41:50,271 --> 01:41:52,011
Julius knew I would go to Paris.I have family here.

1270
01:41:55,610 --> 01:42:00,445
Is he dead?

1271
01:42:02,158 --> 01:42:04,570
After they banned him from the zoo,he became gloomy.

1272
01:42:04,744 --> 01:42:06,655
He wouldn't leave his room any more.

1273
01:42:07,913 --> 01:42:09,699
Was Julius Jewish?

1274
01:42:10,333 --> 01:42:12,699
His grandmother was.

1275
01:42:20,384 --> 01:42:21,669
It seems that was enough for them.

1276
01:42:22,887 --> 01:42:24,718
He was tired.

1277
01:42:27,683 --> 01:42:31,972
He didn't want to live anymore.

1278
01:43:19,944 --> 01:43:22,560
But it was very important to himthat you receive this.

1279
01:43:22,738 --> 01:43:24,444
You can choose between two topics.

1280
01:43:24,615 --> 01:43:28,654
"A journey"

1281
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:36,241
and "a day at the beach".

1282
01:43:49,181 --> 01:43:51,547
You can start.

1283
01:43:51,809 --> 01:43:55,518
Arthur, that's pointless.

1284
01:43:56,480 --> 01:44:00,098
If she doesn't find us today,she'll come back tomorrow.

1285
01:44:00,776 --> 01:44:03,108
Tomorrow I might have money.I don't want to deal with her right now.

1286
01:44:03,362 --> 01:44:05,273
We're not hereand the light stays off.

1287
01:44:14,874 --> 01:44:16,614
Where else would we be?

1288
01:44:16,792 --> 01:44:19,408
Maybe it's only grete.

1289
01:44:24,633 --> 01:44:26,123
Only grete? She's even@@

1290
01:44:28,137 --> 01:44:31,220
Mr. kemper?

1291
01:44:33,309 --> 01:44:34,799
Stop this nonsenseand open the door!

1292
01:44:35,853 --> 01:44:38,686
%%%I know that you're there!&&&If we@@

1293
01:44:38,856 --> 01:44:40,346
This is what happenswhen they let people like you in.

1294
01:44:42,109 --> 01:44:44,191
Liars!

1295
01:44:44,361 --> 01:44:46,727
I have my eye on you, Mr. kemper!

1296
01:44:46,906 --> 01:44:48,396
You won't get past me without paying.

1297
01:44:48,574 --> 01:44:50,064
Dirty Jew.

1298
01:44:55,623 --> 01:44:59,286
That's degrading.

1299
01:45:08,469 --> 01:45:09,754
14, 15, 16, 17, 18@@

1300
01:45:13,808 --> 01:45:17,050
Thank you, madame.

1301
01:45:17,686 --> 01:45:19,972
Madame, why is there money on my test?

1302
01:45:20,147 --> 01:45:21,887
Oh, right, I'd completely forgotten.

1303
01:45:22,566 --> 01:45:26,650
Children, listen to me.

1304
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:30,191
Anna arrived only a year agoand couldn't speak a word of French.

1305
01:45:30,866 --> 01:45:34,358
Her spelling still leavesomething to be desired,

1306
01:45:34,995 --> 01:45:38,704
but her essaywon the school competition.

1307
01:45:38,958 --> 01:45:40,448
Mr. moulin awarded her ten francsfor her journey story.

1308
01:45:43,337 --> 01:45:46,955
What do we say?

1309
01:45:53,806 --> 01:45:56,218
Anna, please come to the frontand read your story out loud.

1310
01:45:57,560 --> 01:46:00,472
"A journey". By Anna kemper.

1311
01:46:00,646 --> 01:46:02,557
"It was a cold February night.

1312
01:46:03,107 --> 01:46:04,938
Arthur had a bad cold.

1313
01:46:05,901 --> 01:46:08,108
He should have stayed in bed.

1314
01:46:08,279 --> 01:46:11,487
Suddenly the telephone rang.

1315
01:46:11,991 --> 01:46:14,528
I'm a friend, ' the voice said.

1316
01:46:16,912 --> 01:46:18,903
'And I have to warn you.'

1317
01:46:19,081 --> 01:46:20,867
I failed needlework,

1318
01:46:21,041 --> 01:46:23,157
but I did really well in sport.

1319
01:46:23,335 --> 01:46:24,541
We had to standon one leg for two minutes.

1320
01:46:24,795 --> 01:46:28,504
That was easy.

1321
01:46:28,674 --> 01:46:31,541
So being good at standing on one legmakes up for how you sew?

1322
01:46:34,263 --> 01:46:36,128
Only at a girls' school!

1323
01:46:45,316 --> 01:46:47,602
Who's writing to papa from england?

1324
01:46:47,776 --> 01:46:49,516
Hello, miss grete.

1325
01:46:49,695 --> 01:46:51,310
And? Is it good?

1326
01:46:51,488 --> 01:46:53,979
Absolutely.

1327
01:46:54,158 --> 01:46:56,740
I'm top of my class. "Wonderful.

1328
01:46:56,911 --> 01:46:59,323
Anna got a gold medalfor standing on one leg.

1329
01:46:59,496 --> 01:47:00,827
Don't be stupid.I won some money actually.

1330
01:47:00,998 --> 01:47:03,705
What for?

1331
01:47:03,876 --> 01:47:06,538
%%%I wrote about your journey&&&Show me.

1332
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:17,677
You Jews always have to be the best,don't you?

1333
01:47:19,099 --> 01:47:22,341
%%%You have mail from england&&&Thanks.

1334
01:47:22,519 --> 01:47:26,478
%%%Shall I read you my story?&&&Please do.

1335
01:47:26,649 --> 01:47:28,480
Math wasn't easy,but I got 18 points there too.

1336
01:47:28,651 --> 01:47:31,939
Only me and one boyin the 7th managed that.

1337
01:47:32,947 --> 01:47:35,359
Really?I have such clever children.

1338
01:47:35,532 --> 01:47:38,023
"A journey by Anna kemper"

1339
01:47:38,202 --> 01:47:41,865
%%%They want to buy it&&&Who wants to buy what?

1340
01:47:42,831 --> 01:47:44,992
Napoleon.The english want to buy my script.

1341
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:54,957
They're paying good money too.

1342
01:47:57,262 --> 01:47:59,253
Wow, this is amazing!

1343
01:48:03,102 --> 01:48:04,933
You get dizzy.

1344
01:48:05,646 --> 01:48:08,012
Watch out!

1345
01:48:12,194 --> 01:48:14,480
Dear balloon, fly to Berlin.Good luck.

1346
01:48:14,655 --> 01:48:16,691
Think it will make it to Berlin?

1347
01:48:18,575 --> 01:48:20,816
Maybe it won't have to.

1348
01:48:25,541 --> 01:48:28,874
I think Julius is very close.

1349
01:48:32,214 --> 01:48:34,170
Look, it's already over les invalides,Napoleon's tomb.

1350
01:48:37,302 --> 01:48:38,587
To Julius, my friend.

1351
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:40,093
Now?

1352
01:48:41,598 --> 01:48:44,135
Yes.

1353
01:48:45,769 --> 01:48:48,476
We've thought about moving to London.

1354
01:48:48,647 --> 01:48:50,808
There's just not enough work here.

1355
01:48:50,983 --> 01:48:53,065
Are you joking?

1356
01:48:53,318 --> 01:48:55,900
I've only just started to like it here.

1357
01:48:56,155 --> 01:48:58,675
And with this script job@@

1358
01:49:00,117 --> 01:49:02,153
We could go ahead to Londonand see if we can find an apartment.

1359
01:49:02,327 --> 01:49:04,033
You could board at school for two weeks.

1360
01:49:04,204 --> 01:49:07,287
No, we can't!

1361
01:49:07,458 --> 01:49:08,538
You can't leave usalone in Paris for a single day!

1362
01:49:09,626 --> 01:49:13,960
But Anna@@

1363
01:49:14,882 --> 01:49:17,214
Parents sometimes have to leavetheir children alone for a short while.

1364
01:49:17,384 --> 01:49:19,591
In england many childrengo to boarding school.

1365
01:49:19,845 --> 01:49:22,427
Those kids have a homeand we don't!

1366
01:49:22,681 --> 01:49:24,797
If you have no home,you have to stay together!

1367
01:49:24,975 --> 01:49:26,465
Otherwise you get lost.

1368
01:49:26,643 --> 01:49:30,101
I agree, little man.

1369
01:49:36,987 --> 01:49:39,194
Don't call me that!I'm not small and I'm not a man.

1370
01:49:41,825 --> 01:49:43,656
Can we never go back home?

1371
01:49:43,827 --> 01:49:45,613
I don't know.

1372
01:49:45,788 --> 01:49:47,244
Maybe one day.

1373
01:49:57,424 --> 01:50:01,042
But not now.

1374
01:50:04,348 --> 01:50:07,055
Maybe we'll never be at homein one single place,

1375
01:50:14,399 --> 01:50:16,060
but a little bit at homein many different places.

1376
01:50:17,027 --> 01:50:18,767
That could be nice too.

1377
01:51:02,531 --> 01:51:04,112
Well@@

1378
01:51:16,044 --> 01:51:17,955
Excuse me.

1379
01:51:19,256 --> 01:51:21,167
Goodbye, gray house.

1380
01:51:21,425 --> 01:51:23,837
Goodbye, rue de la victoire.

1381
01:51:28,515 --> 01:51:30,631
Give me that. I'll put it in the back.

1382
01:51:33,687 --> 01:51:35,894
%%%Hello Arthur&&&Hello.

1383
01:51:50,579 --> 01:51:52,615
There's something I wanted to say.

1384
01:51:52,873 --> 01:51:54,488
What did you say to madame prune?

1385
01:52:29,201 --> 01:52:31,817
That's between me and her.

1386
01:52:31,995 --> 01:52:33,656
That's english.Understand anything?

1387
01:52:34,915 --> 01:52:37,031
Not a word.

1388
01:52:37,834 --> 01:52:40,826
We're back to square one.

1389
01:52:41,088 --> 01:52:42,919
We don't know anyoneand don't understand anything.

1390
01:52:44,883 --> 01:52:49,047
What odd customs do the english have?

1391
01:53:00,357 --> 01:53:04,225
I can't wait to eat a lovely pieceof old cheese in London tonight.

1392
01:53:04,403 --> 01:53:07,611
I don't understand a word,but it doesn't matter.

1393
01:53:22,838 --> 01:53:26,501
Because soon,soon I will understand it all.

1394
01:53:28,176 --> 01:53:30,542
In 1935 Judith kerr and her familyemigrated to england.

1395
01:53:30,721 --> 01:53:33,303
After the war she studied art

1396
01:53:34,850 --> 01:53:36,806
and workedas an illustrator of children's books.

1397
01:53:36,977 --> 01:53:40,765
Her brother Michael studied law

1398
01:53:42,316 --> 01:53:46,275
and became the first foreign-born judgeof the high court of justice.

1399
01:53:46,445 --> 01:53:48,436
"When Hitler stole pink rabbit"was translated into 20 languages

1400
01:53:49,489 --> 01:53:54,028
and made Judith kerr world-famous.

1401
01:53:56,204 --> 01:54:01,915
Judith kerr died in may 2019at the age of 95 in London.

1402
01:54:07,758 --> 01:54:12,001
There she had found the homeshe had longed for.

1403
01:58:52,292 --> 01:58:55,625
Alfred and Judith kerr, 1934
