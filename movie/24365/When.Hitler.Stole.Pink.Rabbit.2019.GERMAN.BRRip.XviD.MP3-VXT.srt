1
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,881
Berlin, February 1933

2
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,214
You're good at that, huh?

3
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,592
Scaring a handful
of little Chinese girls.

4
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,805
Why are you under the table?

5
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,433
The Nazis are after me.

6
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,061
The Nazis?

7
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,615
Hello there, Max.
Aren't you a bit old to be Zorro?

8
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,031
At least it's a costume. Unlike you!

9
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,791
- Well, that's your opinion.
- Idiot.

10
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,541
Hey, give my rabbit back!

11
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,836
Catch!

12
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,923
Max, you show him!

13
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:20,717
Finish him off!

14
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,966
You show it to him, Max! Go on!

15
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,647
Based on the novel by Judith kerr

16
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,032
when Hitler stole pink rabbit

17
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:54,125
- We don't give to beggars.
- You heartless person!

18
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,257
Have you no pity
for a poor beggar child?

19
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:01,504
- And a hungry Zorro?
- Not straight into the living room.

20
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,263
Come on, take off your wet things.

21
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,098
Max knocked them all down.

22
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,934
The cowboys, the Indians...

23
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,762
And the Nazis.

24
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,555
- Yes!
- That was great, Max.

25
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,399
I'm glad you had fun.

26
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,436
Here we go.

27
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:24,777
How did you both get so soaking wet?

28
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,911
We went down the sledding hill.

29
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,458
- Put on something warm. It's on the bed.
- Okay.

30
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:38,923
- You have cheeks like an old dog.
- Well, thank you.

31
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:40,968
Did the doctor come again?

32
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:45,848
He said your father
needs to stay in bed three more days.

33
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,342
He has to take it easy
and he's not allowed to work

34
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,844
or go to the theater.

35
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,310
What are you doing?

36
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,442
- The sausages will drown.
- Their time is up anyhow.

37
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,824
Erich and Otto didn't dress up at all.

38
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,993
They just came as Nazis.

39
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:11,032
They're just as dumb as their parents.

40
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,495
Anna, don't be so cheeky.

41
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,499
- How was carnival?
- Good.

42
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:18,997
Why eat in here?

43
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:22,134
- It's cozy in here with heimpi.
- That's true.

44
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:25,546
Are you going to another concert?
Yes.

45
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,843
Miss fischer is singing schubert.

46
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,847
She's about to pick me up.

47
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:36,018
Max, your vocabulary book
is lying untouched on the desk.

48
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,775
After dinner, you study.

49
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:42,237
- Annuntio vobis gaudium: Habemus papam.
- What's that?

50
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,649
- "We have a pope.”
- You're crazy.

51
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,365
Dorothea kemper.

52
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,959
Yes, speaking.

53
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,413
- Mama?
- Who am I talking to?

54
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,924
Be quiet and finish
that mountain of potato.

55
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,959
Silentium. Favete linguis.

56
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:13,473
Fighting the Jew means removing the Jew!

57
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,392
Are you crazy?
We're socialists, not Nazis.

58
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,396
And we're Jews ourselves.

59
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,437
Then you must be removed!

60
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,736
Get lost! I have to study.

61
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,452
You... spoilsport.

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,206
Heimpi?

63
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,596
- They have no right.
- Mama? You're not...

64
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,678
- Out! Close the door.
- But I...

65
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,640
- I said get out! Now!
- Come back later, honey.

66
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:05,024
It looked bad.
I think mama was crying.

67
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:09,032
No way. Mama never cries.
Maybe she was peeling onions.

68
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:13,746
Sure, she was peeling onions.
Our mother! Wearing an evening gown.

69
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:17,373
Out you come, Anna.
It must be cold in there by now.

70
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,459
In literature and theater,
evil has many faces...

71
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:27,046
- Papa, are you awake?
- Goethe's devil Rose from...

72
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,085
Come here, sweetheart.

73
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:33,056
He was the dreadful phantom
of the unsuspecting...

74
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,050
Not too close. I'm contagious.

75
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,765
Mephisto was at least a gentleman.

76
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:42,061
He came in person
to ask faust for his soul.

77
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,567
Today the devil just sends his servants.

78
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:48,939
Foul and corrupt,
with blood-stained hands,

79
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,984
screaming and full of rhetoric,
it demands Germany's soul.

80
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,572
Is that you on the radio?

81
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,739
Yes.
But you don't have to whisper.

82
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,532
I know what I said last week.

83
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,666
I will vote no against evil.

84
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,168
How was carnival?

85
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,422
So should you.

86
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,246
Great!

87
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,295
I was a beggar girl.

88
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,505
It was very exciting.

89
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,546
The donuts taste better
when you're poor.

90
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,264
That's true. What's that?

91
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,389
A shipwreck.

92
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:19,887
A shipwreck?

93
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,726
Mrs. funk told me
to draw something nice.

94
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,644
Do you want to draw something nice?

95
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,907
It's like a curse.
I can't think of anything but disasters.

96
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,577
This is the best shipwreck
anyone ever drew.

97
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,290
You did a really good job.

98
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,590
It's not bad to draw such gloomy things?

99
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,760
If you want to draw a disaster,
you should.

100
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,547
There's no point drawing
what others expect.

101
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,932
That won't work.

102
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,393
Max captured this at the party.

103
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:17,076
In ancient times,
the swastika was a good luck symbol.

104
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,993
Now it's reduced
to a symbol of stupidity.

105
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,207
Throw it away.

106
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,587
Anna, you'll get sick too.

107
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:35,504
- I'm so scared sometimes, papa.
- Are you?

108
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,343
What are you scared of?

109
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,179
Of the fog and of the pin.

110
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,389
And mama was crying just now.

111
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,893
You'll get infected, honey.

112
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,900
No, I'll never get sick.

113
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,106
Heimpi takes care of me.

114
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,405
When you're sick,
you need a lot of love.

115
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,443
Love is the best medicine in the world.

116
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,071
Hallelujah.

117
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,036
You're a very melodramatic
little person.

118
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,298
Damn! All the snow has gone.

119
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:17,804
Papa.

120
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,181
Papa!

121
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,112
Heimpi!

122
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,190
Where is papa?

123
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,653
Anna!

124
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,913
- Did papa die?
- No.

125
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,453
Max, you listen too.

126
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,417
What I'm about to say
is very important.

127
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,004
We had a phone call yesterday.

128
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:59,004
A man warned your father.
A man from the police.

129
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:02,174
- That's why you didn't go out.
- Exactly.

130
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,512
There are lots of Nazis in the police,
but this man isn't one.

131
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,725
He knows papa and he likes him

132
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,734
because of his newspaper articles
and his books.

133
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:17,189
He called to tell us
that papa's name is on a list.

134
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,028
What list?

135
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,568
If Hitler wins the election
ten days from now,

136
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,072
he'll try to silence
those who are against him.

137
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,579
The man said
that papa's passport would be taken

138
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,042
and that he should leave Germany now,
while he still can.

139
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,502
Leave? But we live here.

140
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,091
And papa has the flu.

141
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,799
He was feeling much better this morning.

142
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,341
Papa is taking that man's concerns
very seriously.

143
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:50,727
So very early this morning
he went to Prague, czechoslovakia.

144
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,107
How does Hitler know
papa can't stand him?

145
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,726
Everyone knows.

146
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,737
He states his opinion
very clearly in the paper.

147
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,902
And he says it on the radio.

148
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,660
And now?
“We'll wait for the elections.

149
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,822
If Hitler wins...

150
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,286
We'll go to meet papa in Prague.

151
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,295
And if he loses,
papa will come back home.

152
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,961
But I don't want to leave!

153
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,672
Neither do I.

154
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,342
But listen.

155
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,680
Nobody, absolutely nobody,

156
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,971
can know that papa has left Germany.

157
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,014
That's very important.

158
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,809
You mustn't tell anybody.

159
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,855
- What about Gunther and oli?
- And elsbeth?

160
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,607
Absolutely not. Nobody!

161
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,292
I'm Jewish too.

162
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:56,421
- Since when?
- Since forever.

163
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,752
Really? I had no idea.

164
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,417
Me neither.

165
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,053
But your nose isn't even...

166
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,389
- Elsbeth, not every...
- Anna?

167
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:10,135
Is your father still sick?

168
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:14,226
- Yes, he has the flu.
- He's had that for a very long time.

169
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,233
That's strange, isn't it?

170
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,435
How high is his fever?

171
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,530
I have to go home.
My mother is waiting.

172
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,407
Give him my best wishes! Yes.

173
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,990
Tell him I miss
his articles in the paper...

174
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,246
Those mean articles!

175
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,416
Anna!

176
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,326
Mama. Yes?

177
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,086
Mrs. lambeck was outside...

178
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,543
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hello.

179
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,049
- Uncle Julius!
- Anna.

180
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,760
- Why are you here? Don't you have work?
- Not today.

181
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,219
Are you eating with us?

182
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:53,763
I can't, I'm afraid.
I stopped by to talk to your mother.

183
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,223
I brought you this.

184
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,479
It's beautiful, thank you.

185
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:07,154
How are the elephants in the zoo?
Wonderful. They don't care about Hitler.

186
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:11,071
They're just happy spring is coming
so they can get back outside.

187
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,115
Anna, your coat.

188
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:19,079
It's about time
we visited the little one.

189
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,669
I bet he's all grown up now.

190
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,760
Blow here.

191
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,592
Thank you.

192
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,852
Can Gunther eat with us?
He knows papa is sick.

193
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:43,236
No, papa needs absolute rest.
I'm sorry, Gunther.

194
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:44,737
That's all right.

195
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,489
- See you tomorrow, Max.
- Bye.

196
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:54,327
Your father has arrived in Prague.
Uncle Julius met him there.

197
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,242
He doesn't want us
to stay here any longer.

198
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:01,371
- We'll meet him in Switzerland tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

199
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,916
Heimpi? Would you like this?

200
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,842
- But...
- I can't take all of this stuff.

201
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,134
- But this isn't right.
- Of course it is.

202
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,138
He's worried they'll take our passports.

203
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,227
We're his family and we're Jews.

204
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,817
- But not proper ones.
- Exactly.

205
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:26,779
- What about school?
- And heimpi?

206
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:31,113
I'll take care of the house
until we all know what's going on.

207
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,370
If the Nazis win,
then you'll come and join us.

208
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,451
You're packing all this for no reason.

209
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:40,251
Two weeks from now,
we'll all be visiting the zoo again.

210
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,128
Julius, those are first editions.

211
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,669
Some are signed.
Can you take them?

212
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,967
- I'll guard them with my life.
- Thank you.

213
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:53,056
- If Hitler wins, when will we come back?
- Nobody knows.

214
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,764
- Maybe in a month, maybe two or three.
- Three months?

215
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,270
No school for three months?

216
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,646
I don't know yet!

217
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,851
The most important thing
is that we don't argue.

218
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,362
Secondly, we have to pack.
Two books and one toy, and that's it.

219
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,990
And thirdly, don't get sick.

220
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,368
And I'll say this again.
We're not telling anybody our plan.

221
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:17,997
You both have a secret to keep now.
That's a very grownup thing.

222
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,795
This is tough.

223
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,835
I love all of you.

224
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,051
If I take Terri,
the rabbit will be sad.

225
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:38,184
And if I take the rabbit,
Terri will be sad.

226
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,187
They're stuffed animals,
they don't have feelings.

227
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,808
It's a shame
we can't take the board games.

228
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,194
I only just got them this Christmas.

229
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,776
I got Terri this Christmas too.

230
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:55,239
- Then take it with you.
- But I've had the rabbit for so long.

231
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,950
You're too old
for stuffed animals anyway.

232
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,082
Leave your drawing pencils here
and you could take both.

233
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,534
No way!

234
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,361
All right, Anna, lights out.

235
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,871
I can't choose, heimpi.

236
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,407
I love them both.

237
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,872
If I leave one behind,
they won't understand.

238
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,751
Listen to me.

239
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,338
After you leave tomorrow,

240
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,303
I'll pack another suitcase,
an extra one.

241
00:16:56,474 --> 00:17:01,138
I'll put your rabbit in there
and some nice books

242
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:02,552
and the board games.

243
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,938
When I know where you are,
I'll send it to you.

244
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,183
All right?

245
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,398
You could just bring it with you
when you come.

246
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,031
Say it, heimpi.

247
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,117
Good night, dear Anna.
Good night, dear Max.

248
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,700
Sleep well, sweet dreams

249
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,829
and goodbye until tomorrow.

250
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,331
Goodbye, heimpi.

251
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,968
Goodbye, heimpi.

252
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:53,687
It's a bit unfair that you can take
your whole huge opera

253
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,984
and we're only allowed one toy.

254
00:17:56,784 --> 00:18:00,572
Nothing is unfair.
I worked on that opera for two years.

255
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,408
Go and get dressed.

256
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,829
Goodbye, office.

257
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,541
Goodbye, round dining table.

258
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,250
Goodbye, grand piano!

259
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,301
Goodbye, dear heimpi kitchen.

260
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,885
Goodbye, lovely old house.

261
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,106
Where is he?

262
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,984
Heimpi,
could you take a look in the house?

263
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,523
- Yes.
- Thanks.

264
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,902
Good morning!

265
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,493
Off on a trip?
So early in the morning?

266
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,121
My husband is so sick

267
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,707
that I'm sending the kids
to stay with family.

268
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,507
Then he won't be able to vote on Sunday.

269
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,670
No, I don't think he will.

270
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,683
- Morning, Mrs. lambeck.
- Morning, Max.

271
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,146
- Where have you been?
- I had to say bye to Gunther.

272
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,727
You what?

273
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,192
Unbelievable. Come on, get in.

274
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,537
See you soon, miss heimpel.

275
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,828
See you soon, Mrs. kemper.

276
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,257
Take care.

277
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,630
Go on, get in.

278
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,180
For going to sleep.

279
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,727
Heimpi.

280
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,440
Anna.

281
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,691
Max.

282
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:30,473
143, 144,

283
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:36,607
145... 146... 147.

284
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,564
- What are you counting?
- The pylons.

285
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,066
149.

286
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,487
Since leipzig there have been
150...

287
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,777
Couldn't think of anything more stupid?

288
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,663
I have nothing left to read.
I finished everything.

289
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,716
"Famous people".

290
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:07,380
You both must stay very quiet
at the Swiss border.

291
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,302
- Why?
- Do you promise?

292
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:15,347
If they ask,
say we're vacationing for a few days.

293
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,849
- But we're...
- No buts!

294
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,152
I have a strange feeling.

295
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:29,160
Don't worry.
Keep your mouth shut and we'll be okay.

296
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:49,631
It seems like every famous person
had a very difficult childhood.

297
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,226
I fear that we won't ever be famous.

298
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,016
I et's wait and see.

299
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:05,821
Papa!

300
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,696
Everything's okay, honey.
We're nearly at the border.

301
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,574
Good morning. Passports, please.

302
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:13,912
Max.

303
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,120
- Morning.
- Where are you headed?

304
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,747
To Zurich.

305
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,459
We're visiting relatives.

306
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,331
Don't you have school?

307
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,667
Somebody passed away.

308
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,925
Kemper.

309
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:39,899
Kemper.

310
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,017
The name is familiar to me.

311
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,358
Where do I know it from?

312
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:50,491
I don't know.
It's not an unusual name.

313
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,109
Yes, it is.

314
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,452
I'll be wracking my brains all day.

315
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:58,245
Have a good trip, madame.

316
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:02,961
Goodbye.

317
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:09,043
Max, please get me a towel.

318
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,841
Passports, please.

319
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,517
- Morning.
- Good morning.

320
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,766
Thank you.

321
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,648
Young lady?

322
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,612
Can I see your face?

323
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,825
You look a little feverish.

324
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,660
I have a cold.

325
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,699
We say "the sniffles" here.

326
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,379
- Welcome to Switzerland, madame.
- Thank you.

327
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,871
Thank you.

328
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,763
You're burning up.

329
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,020
I was so scared.

330
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,272
I know.

331
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,485
Max.

332
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,036
Golden swan hotel, hello.

333
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,380
Hello.

334
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,292
This is my wife.
Welcome, Mrs. kemper.

335
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,839
Look. We can send this to heimpi.

336
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:23,389
Mama?

337
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,022
- I'm so thirsty...
- Honey!

338
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,226
Anna?

339
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:32,941
What is it? Anna”?

340
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,959
Young lady?

341
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,719
Can you hear me?

342
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:03,927
She's in a bad way.
Her temperature is over 104.

343
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,345
That can lead
to inflammation of the brain.

344
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:15,438
- Where can I get it?
- One pharmacy is open until midnight.

345
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:17,527
- Is it far?
- No.

346
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,362
Arthur.

347
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,870
Heimpi must come.

348
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,341
So, Anna?

349
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,631
What's wrong?

350
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,392
Heimpi.

351
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,060
Blow, Anna.

352
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,194
Hey, little man. Are you awake?

353
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,905
My throat hurts.

354
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:12,457
The national socialists
have won 288 seats.

355
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,998
Just like I said, 43.9 percent.

356
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,801
Hitler will form a coalition.

357
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,132
The Germans have lost their minds.

358
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,551
So what do we do now?

359
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,304
Aren't we going back to Berlin?

360
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,821
That's way too cold!

361
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,289
You're back!

362
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:53,744
I'm hungry.

363
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,459
You can have anything you want.
Anything at all.

364
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,251
Anything!

365
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,295
My love.

366
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:15,019
Now I'm glad that you didn't die.

367
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,862
Was there an elephant
in this room recently?

368
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,699
Yes, there was.
He sat in the chair reading to you.

369
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,110
Don't you remember?

370
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,580
Strange. It seemed so real.

371
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,951
Are you strong enough
for another little trip?

372
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,703
Where are we going now?

373
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,506
We have to move.
This hotel is too expensive.

374
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,166
So we're not going home yet?

375
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:43,552
Nope.

376
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:48,849
Hitler didn't win the election,
but he got a majority.

377
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:54,601
- We can't go back yet.
- We're going to the countryside.

378
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,431
Mom, they're here!

379
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,887
They're here!

380
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,399
Welcome to the zwirn guesthouse.

381
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,934
Hello there.

382
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,936
Hello. I'm Franz.

383
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:46,448
Hello. I'm vreneli.
This is my little sister, Trudi.

384
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,618
Hello.

385
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,697
It's empty now, but in summer
the guests mostly sit outside.

386
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,408
The lights are on then.

387
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:02,251
- In the summer I'll go swimming.
- If you ever learn how, you dummy!

388
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:07,261
You'll join my class at school tomorrow,
won't you?

389
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:12,133
Max will go to high school
in sils with Franz.

390
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,113
Watch out, it's hot.

391
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,322
Yummy.

392
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,742
Got everything you need?

393
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,202
Potatoes, beer?

394
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,117
Pickles?

395
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,499
Enjoy your meal.

396
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,006
It smells like old socks.

397
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,251
Stop complaining and eat up.

398
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,421
- But heimpi would...
- Heimpi isn't here.

399
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,761
This is Switzerland.

400
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:59,437
If you carry on dreaming of Germany,
you'll miss wonderful new things.

401
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:07,146
Look, mama likes it.

402
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:11,025
She loves it.

403
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,046
It's silly that I took the dog.

404
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,094
I miss my rabbit.

405
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:38,260
Stop going on about your animals.
We have other problems.

406
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,229
We do? Like what?

407
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,099
You're so immature sometimes.

408
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,777
In Berlin I was more better
in school than you.

409
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,896
Not "more better".

410
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,191
Your illness cost us a pretty penny.

411
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:55,406
We were in that expensive hotel
for three weeks.

412
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,445
I was sick for three weeks?

413
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,955
Yes, you were.

414
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,574
The doctor wasn't cheap either.

415
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,579
What day is it today?

416
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,256
- What's that?
- A calendar.

417
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,218
I'll cross the days off one by one
until we go home.

418
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,132
Then have fun drawing crosses.

419
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,100
Mama said three months...

420
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:22,938
If papa can't sell articles,
you'll end up in a home.

421
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,601
You liar!

422
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:42,658
I hope they have something other
than melted cheese.

423
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:19,328
This is Anna from Germany.
The refugee. She's in our class now.

424
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,788
Welcome, Anna.

425
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,873
Now, listen to me.

426
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:27,119
Anna is from Germany
and doesn't understand our language.

427
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:32,132
We will all have to talk
very slowly and clearly.

428
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,875
I'm Mr. graupe.

429
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,718
I'm from rapperswil.

430
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,132
And you?

431
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,177
Hello. Berlin.

432
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,439
You can sit at the back next to rosi.

433
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,484
Quiet! How is she meant to know?

434
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,609
Ready? We're going to yodel again.

435
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:02,909
What did I do wrong?

436
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,416
Only boys are allowed
to walk down the middle.

437
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:10,044
Girls walk down the side.

438
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,098
Arthur!

439
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,560
Careful!

440
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,314
Not so fast.

441
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,149
It's a piece of cake!

442
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,234
So is Chinese when you can speak it.

443
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,741
- At home papa knew how to do everything.
- Hey!

444
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,074
Those days are over.

445
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,592
Uncle Julius?

446
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:00,632
Uncle Julius!

447
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,055
What are you doing here?

448
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:15,061
I was at a conference in bolzano
and thought I'd drop by!

449
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,326
They came one day after the election,
as you predicted.

450
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,995
They wanted
to confiscate your passports.

451
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:36,290
But heimpi was brave.

452
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:40,632
She said she didn't know where you were,
and she chased them off.

453
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,215
Good old heimpi.

454
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,132
You saw heimpi? Is she well?
Yes.

455
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,221
She asked me to help her.

456
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,353
With what?

457
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:54,266
Last Tuesday they came with a truck
and picked up your things.

458
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,070
What?

459
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,569
The piano too?

460
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:02,073
They took it all.

461
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,907
The big brown suitcase?

462
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,663
I don't know,
but they took everything

463
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:12,205
and said it will be in storage
until you return.

464
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:15,587
All I have is the box of first editions.

465
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,965
At least you have that.
That's good.

466
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:22,051
- I can sell them for you if you want.
- No way.

467
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:24,846
Never.

468
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,263
Could you go and get the suitcase?

469
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:32,395
- It has toys inside. We need them!
- This isn't about your toys.

470
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,276
My rabbit was in that suitcase.

471
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,984
They burned your books too, you know.

472
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,948
Burned by that filthy mob?
I take that as a compliment.

473
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,625
Would you like a piece?

474
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,586
Thanks.

475
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,212
I like Terri.

476
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:02,004
He's much prettier than that old rabbit.

477
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,214
Maybe Hitler is playing
one of my board games right now.

478
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,889
I hope he's nice to my rabbit.

479
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:23,196
Tucholsky has been silent
since the book burning.

480
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,856
I think he's depressed in exile.

481
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:30,404
The Nazis revoked his citizenship.
He's not coming back.

482
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,914
Can you write here?

483
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,041
Yes. That's not the problem.

484
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,875
It's just difficult to publish my work.

485
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,173
Why?

486
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,676
Switzerland worries
that publishing a critic of the Nazis

487
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:48,179
would make them lose their neutrality.

488
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:53,013
And I think they're scared themselves.

489
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:57,852
They think their little country
has got too many Jewish intellectuals.

490
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,729
Are you making enough money?

491
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:10,193
I'll try and change
the publishers' minds.

492
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,821
- Can I touch her?
- She's afraid of strangers.

493
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:17,910
You have to be careful.
No fast movements.

494
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,043
You're safe here.

495
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,840
- That's the main thing.
- I'm not sure.

496
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:31,051
Maybe I shouldn't have left.
Germany needs our voices.

497
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,970
Are you joking?

498
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:39,810
Remember professor teitelbaum?

499
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:45,653
They took him from the university
straight to the camp.

500
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:49,157
Those swines put him in a dog kennel,

501
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,492
attached to an iron chain.

502
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,074
He had to crawl on all fours

503
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,581
and eat his food out of a dog bowl.

504
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,993
He slept chained up on the floor
of a wooden hut.

505
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:05,166
He had to bark every time
someone went in or out of the camp

506
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:08,547
or they'd beat him with sticks.

507
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,763
The chain was so short
that he couldn't stand.

508
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,564
He took his own life after two months.

509
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:55,932
There's a small, warm light
burning in your heart, Anna.

510
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,348
Protect it.

511
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:04,315
Don't let it be extinguished
by anyone or anything.

512
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,196
We have to keep believing in good.
That's important.

513
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,821
Good will always win.

514
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,757
Can you blow this open
for me again?

515
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,469
I don't believe it anymore.

516
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,844
You're pressing the button.

517
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,475
Oh. I have to go.

518
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:04,034
Julius, take care.

519
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,643
Chop-chop. Off to bed.

520
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,771
Thank you.

521
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:33,029
Sleep well, sweet dreams

522
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,273
and goodbye until tomorrow.

523
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,782
Good night.

524
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,661
Night.

525
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,628
Michel, what did I tell you?

526
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:09,190
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing. I'm just looking.

527
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,614
Look at that.
Reto can't do it at all.

528
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:23,704
- Can't do what?
- Cartwheels.

529
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:27,200
- Even I can do them better.
- Who cares?

530
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,993
Boys are dummies anyway.

531
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,333
You need more power.

532
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,752
You have to stretch your legs like this.

533
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,846
Got it? Yes.

534
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,937
It's easy. You can do it.
Just don't forget your legs.

535
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,354
"You need more power"!

536
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,996
There you go!

537
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,392
Vreneli, what's up?
You know full well.

538
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,598
I don't! Please tell me.

539
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:31,640
One thing is for sure.

540
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:35,026
Everyone saw your underwear.

541
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:40,489
You are the dummies now.

542
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,159
They're coming!

543
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,171
What was that?

544
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,626
Just keep going.

545
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,380
What are you doing?

546
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,638
Anna, stop it.

547
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,683
Come on, Anna.

548
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:13,894
I'm warning you now.
If you throw all of those...

549
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:35,161
Help!

550
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:38,624
Mama! Mama, help!

551
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:41,292
- Mamal!
- What's going on?

552
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:45,304
What is all this?
Reto! What's going on?

553
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:48,011
No! Reto!

554
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:51,261
I won't let you go until you tell me.

555
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,725
Out with it! Tell me!

556
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,607
- This is just what we do.
- What's that?

557
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,772
Throw stones at people?

558
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:02,655
Because we love her.
We did it because we love her!

559
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:03,940
What?

560
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,164
Because they love you.

561
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,831
When they love someone
they throw things at them.

562
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,750
You should feel honored.

563
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:25,298
- Okay, then.
- If that's what you do here.

564
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,557
Watch out, something's coming!

565
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:35,725
Thanks, vrenel.

566
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,057
For what?

567
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,355
Being my friend.

568
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:48,026
We're happy you were born
and that it's your birthday today

569
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:51,199
we love you and give you gifts

570
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:54,790
food and fun and games

571
00:45:55,044 --> 00:46:00,380
we're happy that you were born
and that it's your birthday today

572
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,347
"Dear Anna,

573
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:15,015
Theodor and I wish you
a very happy and sunny day."

574
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:20,725
"The elephant baby isn't a baby anymore,
but more like an elementary schooler."

575
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:23,103
"Best wishes to aunt Alice,
from uncle Julius."

576
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,565
- Who is aunt Alice?
- He probably means me.

577
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:29,988
He didn't write my name
because of the Nazis.

578
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:43,130
Thank you! It's lovely.
I'll put it with uncle Julius' elephant.

579
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,338
When I was ten, I got a bike.

580
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:50,338
Better days will come.

581
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:54,680
We're going on a steamboat tour
on lake Zurich this afternoon.

582
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:56,685
Really? Yes.

583
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:59,393
It's organized
by the Swiss literary society.

584
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:01,186
I see.

585
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,812
- Will there be other kids?
- Unlikely.

586
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:09,565
There'll be journalists and publishers.
It could be important for us.

587
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:12,861
Anna, come quickly!
Someone from Germany is on the phone.

588
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:14,654
For me? Yes.

589
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,744
Hello?

590
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:24,872
Anna, is that you?

591
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:26,051
Heimpi!

592
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:30,762
Anna, I wish you
the most wonderful birthday.

593
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,922
Heimpi, I'm ten now!

594
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:37,059
I know, my dear.
That's really and truly incredible.

595
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:39,015
But you don't have to shout.

596
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,226
I'm not your little Anna anymore.

597
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,392
No.

598
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,435
You're ten now.

599
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:51,107
Are you all doing well?

600
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,277
Get out of here. Go.

601
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,950
We're eating cake.

602
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,705
Ask how she got the number.

603
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,412
Papa got me a goat.

604
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:03,328
A goat? Do you have a garden?

605
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:05,462
Where did you get our number?

606
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:07,419
From Mr. Julius.

607
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,337
He gave it to me.

608
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:12,257
Switzerland is beautiful, heimpi.
Please come soon!

609
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:17,383
I can't, my sweet child.

610
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:22,980
I've got a new job
with another family.

611
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:27,647
Take care of yourselves, all right?

612
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:31,401
Heimpi, say something.

613
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:37,988
- The 20 pfennig is nearly gone.
- We're taking a steamboat on the lake!

614
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:39,955
Really?

615
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:42,117
- Hello, Mrs. heimpel.
- Hello from us.

616
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:45,620
- Let me talk to heimpi.
- Has your mother learned to cook?

617
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:50,090
Boys and girls are separated at school.
Everything's different than Berlin.

618
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,001
Anna...

619
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:57,799
Even though you're ten now,
you'll always be my little girl.

620
00:48:57,977 --> 00:49:00,263
I will never forget Max and...

621
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:09,189
Now she's gone.

622
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:12,980
And she found a new family.

623
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:30,582
You've invited me here to talk
as a writer and theater critic,

624
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:37,839
Nobody goes into exile for fun.

625
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:43,686
You love the place where you were
a child, the people and the language.

626
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:46,393
I always thought
it was absurd to be a critic,

627
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:49,229
if criticize was all you ever did.

628
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:54,697
A year ago, German theater
was blossoming, varied and rich.

629
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:59,990
Today it is wanting,
distorted and hollow.

630
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:04,365
It is my job to assess
its current state,

631
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:07,455
even from my place in exile.

632
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:11,589
My radio addresses and new writings
are met with hatred in Germany.

633
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:15,251
But I can't stop myself from thinking.

634
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:35,820
This must be
the most boring birthday you ever had.

635
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:39,783
In Berlin my friends would be visiting.

636
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:44,121
And heimpi would make strawberry cake.

637
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,577
Did you at least sell an article?

638
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,373
It doesn't work that fast, Anna.

639
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:57,001
But I had a few good talks.

640
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:06,723
Know what?
You're not ten years old yet.

641
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,012
Why not?

642
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:13,310
You were born at 6:05 on June 14th 1923
in charlottenburg hospital.

643
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:21,696
I was at the tavern next door
sharing meatballs with your brother Max.

644
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:24,278
We were very nervous.

645
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:27,914
The tavern next door?
Max was only three then.

646
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:38,418
I never imagined your tenth birthday
would be on a boat in Switzerland.

647
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:48,306
Isn't it dangerous
to keep criticizing Hitler?

648
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,971
The Nazis could find us here too.

649
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:54,600
I don't want to be fearful, Anna.

650
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:58,737
And anyway, we're already on the run.

651
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,284
Don't you mind being a refugee?

652
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:05,820
I do.

653
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:11,333
But I find it interesting too.
Who knows where we'll be when you're 11.

654
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,289
Or when you're 127

655
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:15,754
at home?

656
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:30,720
I can't earn any money here.
The Swiss won't give me work.

657
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,852
I think we'll have
to move on to another country.

658
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:37,143
- Where?
- Maybe Paris.

659
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:41,025
There's a Jewish paper
I could write for.

660
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,488
Paris?
Max and I would have to learn French.

661
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:48,371
So what?
You've a clever head on your shoulders.

662
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:54,243
I don't think I've got used
to being a refugee.

663
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:00,674
Am I ten now?

664
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,011
Yes. It's exactly 6:05.

665
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:16,356
At least it means
that Max and I can be famous one day.

666
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:19,360
We'll certainly have
a difficult childhood now.

667
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,401
See? There's good in everything.

668
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:28,653
- Can you manage ten days alone?
- Sure.

669
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,079
Right, little man?

670
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:36,126
If we like Paris
and find an apartment,

671
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,287
we might come back earlier.

672
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:42,045
Tonight we're having
rosti with sausages.

673
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:45,002
Listen to Mrs. zwirn
and do what she says.

674
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,714
She'll come in
and turn out the lights at night.

675
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:52,218
And you'll behave yourselves, okay?

676
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,434
I'll write you a postcard every day.

677
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,313
Thank you.

678
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,854
While your mother and I are in Paris,

679
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:07,149
you two will be representing
our family in Switzerland.

680
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,033
That's a big responsibility.

681
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,944
Why?

682
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,705
Because we Jews live scattered
around the world

683
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:21,250
and the Nazis are spreading
terrible lies about us.

684
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,549
So it's very important
for people like us

685
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,594
to prove that they are wrong.

686
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,593
How do we do that?

687
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,342
By being more honest than others,

688
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,977
more hard-working,
generous and polite.

689
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:39,060
We have to show people
that it's good to be Jewish.

690
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,309
I'm sure that when we get back

691
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:45,480
we'll be very proud
of how you represented us.

692
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,532
- Take good care of the hat, Anna.
- I will.

693
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,281
And you, Max,

694
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:58,492
take good care of Anna.

695
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,376
See you.

696
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:13,382
- You're definitely coming back?
- Of course we are!

697
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:16,852
Don't forget to come and get us.
Don't forget us!

698
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:19,138
Anna, are you crazy?

699
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,602
I'd never forget my children!

700
00:55:56,311 --> 00:56:00,054
Stop eating so much, vali.
You're getting heavier.

701
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:03,395
If I don't eat, I get dizzy.
I'm dizzy already.

702
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:07,107
Nearly there, vali.
You can do it!

703
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:18,079
Hey, no fighting!

704
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:26,668
Hey, Anna.

705
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:29,462
Your dad was in the paper today.

706
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:32,548
Really?
So he finally sold an article.

707
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,338
No, it wasn't that.

708
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,181
It said they're looking for him.

709
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:40,344
Adolf Hitler has even put
a price on his head.

710
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:42,562
1000 reichsmark.

711
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:47,230
But don't worry.

712
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:49,983
Hitler can't touch him here.

713
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,273
He's safe here in Switzerland.

714
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:12,084
Scared of the new school?

715
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:16,505
Of the language maybe.
But I managed to understand you.

716
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,139
I speak German though.

717
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:19,766
More or less.

718
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:24,722
Those two over there
are from Germany too.

719
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:28,108
I know.
But they don't play with me.

720
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,814
They're Nazis.

721
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:39,494
Is it bad to play with them?

722
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:41,405
No.

723
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:46,168
It's bad that they can go back to Berlin
in two weeks and I can't.

724
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:04,394
Wake up! “What is it?

725
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,937
It's empty.

726
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:12,444
It doesn't smell of anything anymore.

727
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:22,947
No, Anna, I'm sorry.
There was no postcard today.

728
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:30,500
Nothing.

729
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:32,710
We'll probably get three tomorrow.

730
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,546
Write about your hike.
They'll like that.

731
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,397
Why put a price on someone's head, Max?
“What?

732
00:58:56,575 --> 00:59:01,194
Mr. graupe said that Hitler
had put a price on papa's head.

733
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:08,325
It's when you promise someone a reward
for finding someone else.

734
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:10,835
We already knew
Hitler's looking for him.

735
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,877
Anyhow, I wish papa was here now.

736
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:30,147
Good morning.
I wish you all a wonderful day.

737
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,023
Thank you.

738
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:34,820
Come on.

739
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:43,406
That was very brave.
Think they realized you were teasing?

740
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,822
I wasn't.
I was trying to be extra polite.

741
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:52,160
Go around. Go on!

742
00:59:53,465 --> 00:59:55,205
Go on! You can't get me.

743
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:57,123
Yes, I will. Don't you worry.

744
00:59:57,302 --> 01:00:00,009
Help me! The thief is too fast!

745
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,094
Go!

746
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:09,390
Papa, I was so scared for your head!

747
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:11,104
My head?

748
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,686
Because Hitler put a price on it.

749
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:17,398
I was a little worried about that too.
Hello, you.

750
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:20,189
Really? Yes.

751
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:24,076
1000 Mark is pretty cheap
for someone like me, don't you think?

752
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:27,363
I'm tempted to write Hitler
a formal complaint.

753
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:28,906
Where is mama?

754
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:31,325
She's in Paris,
fixing up our apartment.

755
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:33,039
Our apartment? Yes.

756
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:36,037
It has a balcony and a kitchen.

757
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,209
I'll do the rest. It's too heavy.

758
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:43,845
There's a whole cheese in there.

759
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:47,132
- And sausages, bread and boiled eggs.
- Thank you.

760
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:52,847
- Something to drink on the road.
- Thank you.

761
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:55,140
Kids, get down.

762
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:03,406
Take good care.
You're always welcome here.

763
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:06,364
Thank you, Mrs. zwirn.
For everything.

764
01:01:06,872 --> 01:01:08,237
Goodbye.

765
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:10,997
- Franz.
- Goodbye.

766
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:13,079
Where is Anna”?

767
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:25,800
I'm sad that you're leaving.
You're my best friend.

768
01:01:26,975 --> 01:01:28,966
Aren't you sad too?

769
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:33,187
Yes, I am.
But as a refugee you often say goodbye.

770
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,597
It's part of my difficult childhood.

771
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:38,107
Anna, come on! We have to go.

772
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:40,394
Look what I've been practicing.

773
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,196
Great, vreneli!

774
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:56,118
Goodbye, narrow alleys.

775
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,705
Goodbye, big rock.

776
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,551
Goodbye, old watering hole.

777
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:24,362
Goodbye, dummy!

778
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:27,319
Bye, Anna.

779
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,260
Look.

780
01:02:57,065 --> 01:02:58,930
It's the Eiffel Tower.

781
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:06,150
The man who built it
wasn't called eiffel, but bonickhausen.

782
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:10,950
The French couldn't pronounce it
so they called him eiffel,

783
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:12,952
because he was from the eifel area.

784
01:03:14,249 --> 01:03:16,080
They can't pronounce that either.

785
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,906
I thought it was yellow.

786
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:59,540
Why?

787
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:03,833
- Because papa said it has a balcony.
- So it had to be yellow?

788
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,627
A nice color, at least.

789
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,589
Press the button.

790
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:15,636
Good evening, professor.

791
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:17,179
Good evening.

792
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:20,683
So... these are your kids?

793
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,680
Yes, this is Max and Anna.

794
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,066
How cute. Evening, little one.

795
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:28,482
I bought you some candy.

796
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,855
Come here, Fifi!

797
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,200
Thanks.

798
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:35,531
- You're welcome.
- Thanks.

799
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:37,867
Wait a moment.

800
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,536
Please sign here.

801
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:44,043
- What is it?
- The authorization.

802
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:46,542
- What authorization?
- Mine, of course.

803
01:04:47,759 --> 01:04:49,420
So that everything is in order.

804
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:53,545
Perfect.

805
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:57,261
- Do we have an elevator?
- Is that because we're rich now?

806
01:04:57,519 --> 01:04:59,100
Come on.

807
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,611
- My darlings!
- Mamal

808
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:16,651
yes!

809
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:20,038
- You're finally here!
- I missed you so much.

810
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,747
Mrs. zwirn gave us a whole
chocolate cake to take with us.

811
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,832
- Hello.
- Hello, sir.

812
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:33,384
Come on in.

813
01:05:33,555 --> 01:05:35,045
I wonder what it's like.

814
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:38,807
This is your room, the yellow one.

815
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:45,013
Yellow is such a nice, happy color.

816
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:48,892
Why is it so dark in here?

817
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:51,186
You have this nice little lamp.

818
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:54,071
- It's not so bad.
- Come into the living room.

819
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:58,660
It's the kitchen too.

820
01:05:58,830 --> 01:06:00,161
Nice.

821
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:10,881
- This is what you called a balcony?
- Yes. For me, this is a balcony.

822
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:14,759
- Who used to live here?
- The servants.

823
01:06:15,013 --> 01:06:16,844
It's cozy.

824
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:23,009
Is this your room, papa?

825
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,474
Yes.

826
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:31,734
This is my office.

827
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,146
And the bathroom?

828
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:37,819
The toilet is in the stairwell.

829
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,110
We share it with the neighbor.

830
01:06:40,288 --> 01:06:43,451
I'll give you a bowl of warm water
to wash with.

831
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:45,206
Who is our neighbor?

832
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:47,162
She's called grete.

833
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:50,420
She's a girl from Austria.

834
01:06:51,466 --> 01:06:53,502
She's here to learn French.

835
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:57,798
She's a little... strange,
but she speaks German.

836
01:06:58,056 --> 01:06:59,341
Is she Jewish too?

837
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:02,053
- The potatoes!
- Unlikely.

838
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:06,394
- Oh, no.
- Where will you sleep?

839
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:08,270
I'll show you something.

840
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,776
Max, help me out.
Take a hold and pull.

841
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:17,110
Come on. And voila.

842
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:19,114
A magic sofa!

843
01:07:21,329 --> 01:07:23,285
Watch out. There we go.

844
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:26,289
- I burned everything.
- It's okay.

845
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:30,122
We have one more room
than we did at the zwirns.

846
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:33,955
I thought it would be nicer.

847
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,258
Me too.

848
01:07:40,682 --> 01:07:42,593
I tried my best.

849
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:45,429
But the stove here is hard to control.

850
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:49,391
The egg tastes good.

851
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:51,810
But the potatoes are a little dark.

852
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,148
Burned.

853
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:55,477
It doesn't matter.

854
01:07:56,531 --> 01:07:57,691
Try this.

855
01:07:57,865 --> 01:08:00,698
You can live wonderfully
on cheese, baguette and wine.

856
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:03,075
Baguette?

857
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:06,496
It's French for "stick".

858
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:09,915
Give me that.

859
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:15,459
Hey, not too much.

860
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:19,418
I think it's gone bad.

861
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:25,006
- It's moldy already.
- It's a Saint maure.

862
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:27,179
Goats cheese rolled in ash.

863
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:29,969
Every place we end up,
there's old cheese.

864
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:32,930
Seems so.

865
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:35,975
I drink to our family

866
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:38,270
and to our future in this city.

867
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:40,279
Cheers.

868
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:43,737
That sounded... very fluent.

869
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:49,246
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

870
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:02,005
Can you swim in this river?

871
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:03,795
Yes, but not here.

872
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,805
The river is called the seine.

873
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,431
Come on.

874
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,982
Seine... hello... cheers.

875
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,393
I already know these three words
in French.

876
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:32,620
We can't allow our reviews

877
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:35,539
to harm emigrated German artists.

878
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:38,960
Our reviews are serious
but not scathing.

879
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:41,340
We request you to be tactful.

880
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:43,585
You were Berlin's most-feared critic.

881
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:49,432
It's not in my interest
to make life hard for my fellow Germans.

882
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:52,223
I much prefer giving praise
than giving scorn.

883
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:54,103
Really?

884
01:09:55,483 --> 01:09:58,065
Would you be prepared
to write for us once a week

885
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:00,435
about the Parisian theater scene?

886
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:05,614
I'd love to do even more.

887
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:09,657
We'd like to give you more,
but we can't afford it.

888
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:11,450
Culture is a luxury now.

889
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:43,777
Finally!

890
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:47,065
- How was it?
- Good. Papa has work.

891
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:51,448
Really?

892
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:54,364
- That's mine.
- Can I have one too?

893
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,502
Are we eating here? I'm hungry.

894
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:03,294
One review a week for 15 francs.
That's 60 francs a month.

895
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:06,501
Can I get you anything?

896
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:08,549
How will we live on that?

897
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,130
No, thanks. We're going.

898
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:15,889
Let your sister have some.

899
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:24,190
- All we have at home is bread and...
- Cheese.

900
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:27,070
We'll get butter and eggs
on the way home.

901
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:28,981
Eggs again?

902
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,697
Yes, eggs again.

903
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:33,736
Come on, let's go.

904
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,046
I left this half for you.

905
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:52,468
- Max?
- I need a new schoolbag, a French one.

906
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:54,382
And long pants.

907
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,643
- I see.
- How was it with the other boys?

908
01:11:57,814 --> 01:12:01,306
No idea.
I didn't understand a word all day.

909
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:06,899
How can I make new friends
when I don't speak this stupid language?

910
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:10,110
The best way to learn a language
is through the music.

911
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:18,702
Stop it. You're embarrassing me.

912
01:12:22,547 --> 01:12:23,878
Come on.

913
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:29,208
Anna, come!

914
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:40,353
- Can't you stay on your side?
- Why do you need so much space?

915
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:43,222
I can't concentrate with you scribbling.

916
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:46,859
- Then go somewhere else.
- I have to study.

917
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:49,645
- Draw your stupid pictures on the floor.
- Max.

918
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:52,614
It's unfair
that Max can go to school and I can't.

919
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:54,780
One private school is enough expense.

920
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:57,696
Then I'll go to a non-private school.

921
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,786
That's where very simple people
send their kids.

922
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,121
We're simple people too now.

923
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:06,041
They don't even teach Latin there.

924
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:11,426
We might be poor,
but your education comes first.

925
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:13,086
Now what?

926
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:15,095
I have to concentrate.

927
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:18,599
I wish I had a sister.

928
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:20,851
I wish I didn't.

929
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:36,650
Am I also too loud?

930
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,444
It's okay.

931
01:13:39,874 --> 01:13:42,661
Can I stay with you for a while?

932
01:13:43,878 --> 01:13:45,368
Did you argue again?

933
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:54,385
How are your disasters?

934
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:03,219
Will they all die in the avalanche?

935
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:05,346
I'm afraid so.

936
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:17,946
Do you have time to go
and ask the concierge for the mail?

937
01:14:24,794 --> 01:14:26,876
Anna, did you hear me?

938
01:14:27,046 --> 01:14:29,082
Yes, I did.

939
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:36,006
I'm scared of the stairwell.

940
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:38,800
I see.

941
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:44,601
Okay, I'll come with you this time.

942
01:14:44,772 --> 01:14:46,512
But tomorrow you'll do it alone.

943
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:48,352
Good. Come on.

944
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:09,585
- Good day, miss grete.
- Good day.

945
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:13,422
Why is she always so strange?

946
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:16,208
I don't know
and I don't want to think about it.

947
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:22,347
Did you find a job
that's to your liking

948
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,349
Mr. professor kemper?

949
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:29,430
Yes, madame prune,
I work for a Paris newspaper.

950
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:31,974
You don't have to worry about the rent.

951
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:34,026
Pleased to hear it.

952
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,652
One of those immigrant papers, is it?

953
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:40,524
Want an olive?

954
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:44,738
- Lots of Jews find work there.
- I hope so.

955
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,577
Come on, Anna.

956
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:53,709
Don't forget
that the rent is due every week.

957
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:55,874
- Fridays!
- Got it.

958
01:15:56,552 --> 01:16:02,297
"Dear Anna, this lovely hare
reminded me of your pink rabbit.

959
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:05,387
How are you doing
in the beautiful city of Paris?

960
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:08,519
Did you already
try snails in garlic butter?

961
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:12,557
Aunt Alice gave me
some smart advice a while ago.

962
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:15,442
Sometimes I think
that I should have taken it.

963
01:16:15,613 --> 01:16:18,446
Lots of love from uncle Julius."

964
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:20,898
What advice?

965
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:23,693
Can you really eat snails?

966
01:16:25,206 --> 01:16:27,322
He shouldn't have gone back to Germany.

967
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:31,241
I kept telling him.

968
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:53,351
I look terrible.

969
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:57,606
My hair!

970
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:05,825
Where are you going?

971
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:12,533
Arthur, no!

972
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,332
It's far too expensive!

973
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:21,630
I don't want any. No!

974
01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:24,086
Arthur, come back.

975
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:27,594
Stop it!

976
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:02,925
- Done!
- Really? All of the exercises?

977
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:05,340
- Yes, yes.
- I'll be right there.

978
01:18:20,321 --> 01:18:21,936
Excellent!

979
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:30,862
- Hello, how can I help you?
- Hello, madame.

980
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,033
Pencil.

981
01:18:37,338 --> 01:18:39,374
I think "madame" is for a woman.

982
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:43,590
That's right.

983
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:47,215
Thank you.

984
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:49,338
Pencil.

985
01:19:00,027 --> 01:19:02,018
Thanks. You're welcome.

986
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:04,937
Two francs.

987
01:19:08,202 --> 01:19:09,863
Thank you very much.

988
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:11,777
And... goodbye.

989
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:14,196
Goodbye.

990
01:19:15,542 --> 01:19:18,659
There's nothing left?
Mama said we could keep the change.

991
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:21,328
- It doesn't matter. Come on.
- It does matter!

992
01:19:21,507 --> 01:19:23,372
Cheap, cheap...

993
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:25,791
Cheap!

994
01:19:26,303 --> 01:19:28,510
Cheap pencil?

995
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:42,725
Thank you.

996
01:19:46,657 --> 01:19:49,148
Yes, yes. Got it.

997
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:59,291
Thanks. You're welcome.

998
01:20:00,379 --> 01:20:04,543
We have 20 cents now.
Think of what we can buy with that!

999
01:20:04,717 --> 01:20:06,548
Probably not very much.

1000
01:20:07,428 --> 01:20:09,259
Goodbye, madame.

1001
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:17,635
I ook at that nutcracker!

1002
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:30,523
It smells like grunewald.

1003
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:32,649
I hope we have
a Christmas tree this year.

1004
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:34,159
Of course!

1005
01:20:35,205 --> 01:20:37,412
My dear friend.

1006
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:41,542
Your postcards are rays of light
on an otherwise dark horizon.

1007
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:46,213
You are the only one from back home
whom we hear from.

1008
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:48,999
All of the hauptmanns,
einsteins, oldens...

1009
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:51,840
Where are they now?

1010
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:55,302
I can't help wondering
if in the past they would have left

1011
01:20:55,476 --> 01:20:56,636
a letter from me unanswered.

1012
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,347
Surely not.

1013
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:03,938
I never thought I would write this,

1014
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:08,193
but I'm afraid I must ask you to sell
a few of our first editions.

1015
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:15,947
I've had my
German citizenship taken away.

1016
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,701
Now I'm primarily one thing: A Jew.

1017
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:25,661
At least that means we don't belong
to the misled masses or the Nazi mob.

1018
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:31,091
And Jews are experienced emigrants.

1019
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:33,843
And although it's painful,

1020
01:21:34,014 --> 01:21:37,302
I'm happy to belong to a people
with such rich heritage.

1021
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:59,403
Papa? I think I have to go up there.

1022
01:22:03,877 --> 01:22:05,833
No, you can sit down here.

1023
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,385
Mr. kemper?

1024
01:22:24,982 --> 01:22:27,769
Mr. kemper?
I didn't mean to startle you.

1025
01:22:28,902 --> 01:22:30,312
Do you remember me?

1026
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:32,944
I'm afraid I don't.

1027
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:34,563
Robert Stein.

1028
01:22:35,409 --> 01:22:36,774
From the theater.

1029
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:39,321
Exactly. That's the one.

1030
01:22:39,496 --> 01:22:41,077
Hello.

1031
01:22:41,331 --> 01:22:44,539
- I didn't know you were in Paris.
- My wife has family here.

1032
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:48,786
There's no more work for me in Berlin.
We came a year ago.

1033
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:51,622
This is my daughter Anna.

1034
01:22:53,343 --> 01:22:55,208
- Hello, Anna.
- Hello.

1035
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:06,102
If you're ever there,
we live in the 7th arrondissement.

1036
01:23:06,356 --> 01:23:09,223
Maybe you and your family
could come over for tea.

1037
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:13,359
Berlin is ancient history now.

1038
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:16,146
I'd love to spend time
with such a brilliant mind.

1039
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:18,823
Thank you.

1040
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:21,492
I'll be in touch.

1041
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:23,403
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1042
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:26,205
- Goodbye, Anna.
- Bye.

1043
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:30,252
Papa, don't you like that man?

1044
01:23:31,048 --> 01:23:32,333
I have no reason not to.

1045
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:35,674
But I thought he might not like me.

1046
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:43,924
We bumped
into Robert Stein at the synagogue.

1047
01:23:44,102 --> 01:23:45,342
Robert Stein?

1048
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:49,722
- You tore him to pieces a few times.
- Very true.

1049
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:52,642
He's an intensely untalented director.

1050
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:56,186
His productions were unbearable.

1051
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:58,063
I thought he was nice.

1052
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:02,030
It wasn't my job to find out
how nice he was.

1053
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:03,740
He was bad and that's that.

1054
01:24:03,914 --> 01:24:06,121
And if you say so then it must be true.

1055
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:08,536
That's right.

1056
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:09,909
You're so arrogant.

1057
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:14,167
He didn't seem very resentful.

1058
01:24:14,424 --> 01:24:16,289
Wasn't his wife a pianist too?

1059
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:19,460
He invited us to tea.
They live in a very fancy area.

1060
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:23,672
Wild horses couldn't drag me
to that amateur.

1061
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:43,821
Thank you, mama.

1062
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:45,236
You're welcome.

1063
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:46,574
It's beautiful.

1064
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:50,408
- They really did turn out as pullovers.
- Indeed.

1065
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:53,285
Did somebody doubt they would?

1066
01:24:53,463 --> 01:24:55,169
Come here, this is for you.

1067
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:03,758
That's beautiful.

1068
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:05,927
Show me.

1069
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,471
Flick through with your thumb.

1070
01:25:10,188 --> 01:25:12,429
It's amazing. How did you do it?

1071
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:13,851
Max, look.

1072
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:18,401
Not bad, little man!

1073
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:21,901
I didn't want to give you
any more disasters.

1074
01:25:25,162 --> 01:25:26,868
Is this a school bag?

1075
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:29,280
Your mother found
a public school for you.

1076
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:32,824
I thought those schools
were bad for people like us.

1077
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:35,077
Who says such nonsense?

1078
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:38,630
That's hard to imagine.

1079
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:46,884
How did you...

1080
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:50,426
I didn't steal them, that's for sure.

1081
01:25:57,194 --> 01:25:58,934
Dorothea?

1082
01:26:03,617 --> 01:26:05,608
I have something else for you.

1083
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:09,035
So you don't forget who you are.

1084
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:30,632
Happy Christmas.

1085
01:26:31,978 --> 01:26:33,138
Thank you.

1086
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:38,057
A balloon.

1087
01:26:44,574 --> 01:26:45,859
"Dear Anna,

1088
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:49,652
my most heartfelt wishes
for a wonderful Christmas.

1089
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:52,537
Drop this balloon from the Eiffel Tower

1090
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:55,916
and the west wind is sure to blow it
to my front door in Berlin.

1091
01:26:58,004 --> 01:27:01,838
That would make me happy.
I look to the new year full of hope.

1092
01:27:02,008 --> 01:27:04,294
Things can and must get better.

1093
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:06,425
On that note... yours, Julius."

1094
01:27:12,352 --> 01:27:14,092
Happy Christmas, miss grete!

1095
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:15,386
Good evening.

1096
01:27:22,821 --> 01:27:25,813
If we're Jewish,
why do we celebrate Christmas?

1097
01:27:28,285 --> 01:27:32,369
I see it as a German celebration
rather than a Christian one.

1098
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:36,073
It reminds me
of wonderful family gatherings

1099
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,541
when I was your age.

1100
01:27:44,468 --> 01:27:46,629
Do you believe in god?

1101
01:27:48,764 --> 01:27:50,595
I'm afraid not.

1102
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:55,721
I only believe in gratefulness.

1103
01:27:56,980 --> 01:28:00,347
People who don't feel grateful
always lose.

1104
01:28:01,693 --> 01:28:04,730
I'm very grateful right now,
especially for my school bag.

1105
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:12,317
Where are you from?

1106
01:28:12,496 --> 01:28:14,327
Anna, how long will you stay?

1107
01:28:14,998 --> 01:28:17,614
Do you understand?
Your skirt is too short.

1108
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:20,660
Do you have a little sister?
Why are you wearing her coat?

1109
01:28:20,921 --> 01:28:24,129
You need a uniform.
I'll show you where to get one.

1110
01:28:34,059 --> 01:28:36,050
Napoleon's victories:

1111
01:28:36,686 --> 01:28:38,927
1800 marengo,

1112
01:28:39,105 --> 01:28:41,437
1805 austerlitz,

1113
01:28:41,608 --> 01:28:43,690
1806 jena,

1114
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:46,560
1807 friedland,

1115
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:49,484
1809 wagram.

1116
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:51,982
Very good. You can sit down.

1117
01:28:56,706 --> 01:29:00,324
His final defeat was in Waterloo.
That was in 1815.

1118
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:04,040
That's true.
Is that all they said about Napoleon?

1119
01:29:04,214 --> 01:29:06,330
There are so many interesting things.

1120
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:09,375
The whole lesson
was just learning the dates.

1121
01:29:09,553 --> 01:29:11,635
- Hi, papa. Hi, little man.
- Hello.

1122
01:29:11,888 --> 01:29:14,675
- How was it?
- Good. I got my uniform today.

1123
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:16,511
Understand anything yet?

1124
01:29:16,685 --> 01:29:19,051
- No, but math is easy.
- Very good.

1125
01:29:19,312 --> 01:29:21,223
That's something at least.

1126
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:24,765
- You look French already.
- Is that good or bad?

1127
01:29:24,943 --> 01:29:27,059
- I don't know.
- Hello.

1128
01:29:30,532 --> 01:29:32,523
Potato soup again?

1129
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:36,285
- Is there meat in it at least?
- You ask the same thing every day.

1130
01:29:37,247 --> 01:29:39,238
I guess cinema is out of the question?

1131
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:42,078
It's the first time
my classmates invited me.

1132
01:29:42,252 --> 01:29:44,083
But I bet I can't go, can I?

1133
01:29:44,254 --> 01:29:46,461
Okay, then you decide!

1134
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:50,465
Either we have a hot meal tomorrow
or you go to the cinema with your pals.

1135
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:54,303
We can only do one or the other.
So, what do we do?

1136
01:29:54,472 --> 01:29:57,464
Will things stay like this for ever?

1137
01:29:59,102 --> 01:30:00,683
They've got us.

1138
01:30:01,354 --> 01:30:03,970
- The Nazis.
- You silly thing.

1139
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:06,140
It's just the lightbulb.

1140
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:09,692
Max, you and I will take a walk later.

1141
01:30:13,116 --> 01:30:15,198
That's another two francs.

1142
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:27,244
- So you're still hungry.
- I'm always hungry.

1143
01:30:31,718 --> 01:30:33,299
Wait here.

1144
01:30:49,152 --> 01:30:52,815
- Shouldn't we have bought a lightbulb?
- Try it, it's good.

1145
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:57,615
Here, monsieur.

1146
01:30:57,786 --> 01:30:59,276
Thank you.

1147
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:24,059
Kids! Tell your dad
the rent was due two days ago.

1148
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:26,390
On Friday.

1149
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:30,023
Was he famous in Germany, your dad?

1150
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:34,398
- Are you Jews?
- Yes, we're Jews.

1151
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:41,117
You're not in Germany anymore.
This is Paris. Understood?

1152
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:45,322
Typical!

1153
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:49,793
Strange people,
creeping around like thieves.

1154
01:31:49,963 --> 01:31:51,453
Right, Fifi? Jews.

1155
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:57,337
It's not deep.

1156
01:31:58,513 --> 01:32:00,128
But it's so cold.

1157
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,847
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting in.

1158
01:32:08,273 --> 01:32:09,809
That's not allowed.

1159
01:32:10,608 --> 01:32:12,690
Most of them have gone green anyway.

1160
01:32:24,456 --> 01:32:26,242
This is crazy, Anna.

1161
01:32:28,251 --> 01:32:30,993
Stop staring at me like a dummy
and give me a hand.

1162
01:33:10,335 --> 01:33:12,166
Hello, madame batier.

1163
01:33:12,337 --> 01:33:14,123
Hello, girls.

1164
01:33:31,231 --> 01:33:32,562
Light!

1165
01:33:32,732 --> 01:33:34,893
Nobody could have imagined
what would become of him.

1166
01:33:35,151 --> 01:33:37,062
His mother was called laetitia.

1167
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:40,812
- How did you get the money?
- Napoleon wanted recognition.

1168
01:33:40,990 --> 01:33:44,448
- We just took a little dip.
- But she never took him seriously.

1169
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:47,740
He excelled at school

1170
01:33:47,914 --> 01:33:50,656
and became a leader
at an incredibly young age.

1171
01:33:50,834 --> 01:33:52,415
He won victory after victory,

1172
01:33:52,669 --> 01:33:57,208
was even crowned emperor
and made his siblings kings and queens.

1173
01:33:57,382 --> 01:34:00,294
But his mother always said,
"let's see how long it lasts."

1174
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:04,461
And it didn't turn out well.

1175
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:08,799
Would it have been different
if she'd shown pride in him?

1176
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:14,558
Napoleon is such an interesting topic.

1177
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:18,600
He always fell for women
who looked like his mother.

1178
01:34:19,445 --> 01:34:22,903
But his mother
didn't like any of them, of course.

1179
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:24,819
How do you know all this?

1180
01:34:25,618 --> 01:34:27,574
I read up on it again just now.

1181
01:34:28,746 --> 01:34:32,238
- I'm doing a script about his childhood.
- For a movie?

1182
01:34:33,168 --> 01:34:36,376
If someone buys it,
then it might get made into a movie.

1183
01:34:37,755 --> 01:34:39,211
Good night.

1184
01:34:40,884 --> 01:34:42,340
Good night.

1185
01:34:43,386 --> 01:34:44,842
Good night.

1186
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:47,595
Do you know things about Napoleon?

1187
01:34:47,765 --> 01:34:51,974
Yes, he didn't have
a musical bone in his body.

1188
01:34:52,145 --> 01:34:55,637
The only thing he liked
were drums and trumpets.

1189
01:34:55,815 --> 01:34:59,933
But there was a corsican nursery rhyme
that he always remembered.

1190
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,801
Papa is having nightmares again.

1191
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:36,560
Let me sleep.

1192
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:38,187
But I'm scared.

1193
01:35:57,752 --> 01:35:59,617
Can't you sleep?

1194
01:36:09,055 --> 01:36:11,046
Is grete a Nazi?

1195
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:15,550
Maybe.

1196
01:36:16,854 --> 01:36:19,140
Perhaps she just doesn't like Jews.

1197
01:36:20,483 --> 01:36:22,940
Like madame prune.

1198
01:36:25,863 --> 01:36:29,105
- Will there be food?
- Certainly. Don't be too loud.

1199
01:36:30,326 --> 01:36:32,157
Be on your best behavior, okay?

1200
01:36:37,375 --> 01:36:38,375
Right.

1201
01:36:41,421 --> 01:36:45,380
- Mrs. kemper, how lovely.
- Mrs. Stein, thanks for the invitation.

1202
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:47,381
Come inside.

1203
01:36:48,052 --> 01:36:50,919
I was so pleased to get your call.

1204
01:36:51,097 --> 01:36:53,588
I get so incredibly bored all day.

1205
01:36:54,976 --> 01:36:56,261
Come.

1206
01:36:56,519 --> 01:36:58,555
Hannah, Gustav, our guests are here!

1207
01:37:03,651 --> 01:37:07,564
Just because our husbands are immature,
it doesn't mean we have to be.

1208
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:10,188
- Isn't that so?
- Indeed.

1209
01:37:11,451 --> 01:37:14,318
I'm thrilled
to have visitors from Berlin.

1210
01:37:16,331 --> 01:37:18,492
My husband never meant it personally.

1211
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:21,283
He loves theater so much
that sometimes he...

1212
01:37:21,461 --> 01:37:22,746
Mrs. kemper,

1213
01:37:23,004 --> 01:37:25,996
Robert was incredibly hurt
by what your husband wrote,

1214
01:37:26,174 --> 01:37:29,666
but I'm sure that in the end
it helped him develop.

1215
01:37:30,595 --> 01:37:32,881
What is your husband working on now?

1216
01:37:33,139 --> 01:37:35,881
He's writing a script about Napoleon.

1217
01:37:37,310 --> 01:37:39,471
He has time right now.

1218
01:37:39,645 --> 01:37:41,931
Napoleon? How interesting.

1219
01:37:43,941 --> 01:37:46,057
You can leave the table
if you're done.

1220
01:37:46,778 --> 01:37:47,858
Thank you.

1221
01:37:52,742 --> 01:37:55,199
I'll show you my room.

1222
01:37:56,621 --> 01:37:58,828
- Would you like a liqueur?
- Certainly.

1223
01:38:10,510 --> 01:38:13,252
Does it suit me?
I'll wear it on the golf course.

1224
01:38:13,805 --> 01:38:16,717
What a charming idea!
You look like a buttercup.

1225
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:19,974
You'll be followed
by swarms of butterflies.

1226
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:23,933
And you, my dearest heart,
look like a lampshade.

1227
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:26,977
Take whatever you like.
We have too much anyway.

1228
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:29,312
If you don't,
it'll be donated to the needy.

1229
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:31,310
We're needy too.

1230
01:38:31,948 --> 01:38:35,190
We also have lots of German books
that we already read.

1231
01:38:35,368 --> 01:38:36,983
You know how to read, don't you?

1232
01:38:37,829 --> 01:38:39,285
Read?

1233
01:38:40,456 --> 01:38:44,290
What do you mean?
Our parents don't believe in education.

1234
01:39:25,918 --> 01:39:27,124
You'll give that all back!

1235
01:39:27,879 --> 01:39:30,791
My kids don't need handouts.
Certainly not from that clown!

1236
01:39:31,883 --> 01:39:33,714
We're not beggars!

1237
01:39:34,677 --> 01:39:36,633
Do you know what your kids need?

1238
01:39:37,430 --> 01:39:40,137
They need food and clothes

1239
01:39:40,308 --> 01:39:41,969
and all kinds of things.

1240
01:39:42,143 --> 01:39:44,179
And I couldn't care less
where we get it.

1241
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:48,433
You're not a famous critic
living in grunewald anymore.

1242
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:50,348
Those days are over.

1243
01:39:52,195 --> 01:39:56,029
If the clothes were meant
for poor children anyway,

1244
01:39:56,199 --> 01:39:58,030
why not give them to ours?

1245
01:39:58,201 --> 01:40:01,034
I'm not giving these pants back.
You don't have to.

1246
01:40:02,538 --> 01:40:04,278
Are we poor now?

1247
01:40:17,303 --> 01:40:19,214
- Very good, manon.
- Thank you.

1248
01:40:19,388 --> 01:40:21,549
Anna, 147 mistakes.

1249
01:40:22,934 --> 01:40:25,141
You have to work harder,

1250
01:40:25,311 --> 01:40:28,018
or you won't move up to the next class.

1251
01:40:28,272 --> 01:40:29,853
Do you understand?

1252
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:37,110
Rosalie, good.

1253
01:40:37,823 --> 01:40:40,030
Anna, you have very pretty shoes.

1254
01:40:40,201 --> 01:40:41,691
- Catherine, very good.
- Thanks.

1255
01:40:42,954 --> 01:40:45,787
Isabelle, watch your commas.

1256
01:40:52,213 --> 01:40:56,001
A year ago, he lost his job
at the natural history museum.

1257
01:40:56,175 --> 01:40:58,086
I didn't know that.

1258
01:41:00,763 --> 01:41:02,219
Hello.

1259
01:41:03,808 --> 01:41:07,016
This is our daughter Anna.
Julius was her godfather.

1260
01:41:07,186 --> 01:41:11,350
Anna, this is heinz rosenfeld,
one of Julius's friends.

1261
01:41:11,524 --> 01:41:13,731
- From Berlin.
- Hello.

1262
01:41:14,819 --> 01:41:16,150
So, you're Anna.

1263
01:41:19,782 --> 01:41:22,319
Julius didn't want you to worry.

1264
01:41:23,578 --> 01:41:25,409
Carry on.

1265
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:30,247
He was doing fairly well
for a long while.

1266
01:41:31,127 --> 01:41:34,745
He went to the zoo every day
and visited his animals.

1267
01:41:36,465 --> 01:41:40,333
He did menial work
in a cigarette factory twice a week.

1268
01:41:40,970 --> 01:41:44,554
Julius knew I would go to Paris.
I have family here.

1269
01:41:50,271 --> 01:41:52,011
Is he dead?

1270
01:41:55,610 --> 01:42:00,445
After they banned him from the zoo,
he became gloomy.

1271
01:42:02,158 --> 01:42:04,570
He wouldn't leave his room any more.

1272
01:42:04,744 --> 01:42:06,655
Was Julius Jewish?

1273
01:42:07,913 --> 01:42:09,699
His grandmother was.

1274
01:42:10,333 --> 01:42:12,699
It seems that was enough for them.

1275
01:42:20,384 --> 01:42:21,669
He was tired.

1276
01:42:22,887 --> 01:42:24,718
He didn't want to live anymore.

1277
01:42:27,683 --> 01:42:31,972
But it was very important to him
that you receive this.

1278
01:43:19,944 --> 01:43:22,560
You can choose between two topics.

1279
01:43:22,738 --> 01:43:24,444
"A journey"

1280
01:43:24,615 --> 01:43:28,654
and "a day at the beach".

1281
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:36,241
You can start.

1282
01:43:49,181 --> 01:43:51,547
Arthur, that's pointless.

1283
01:43:51,809 --> 01:43:55,518
If she doesn't find us today,
she'll come back tomorrow.

1284
01:43:56,480 --> 01:44:00,098
Tomorrow I might have money.
I don't want to deal with her right now.

1285
01:44:00,776 --> 01:44:03,108
We're not here
and the light stays off.

1286
01:44:03,362 --> 01:44:05,273
Where else would we be?

1287
01:44:14,874 --> 01:44:16,614
Maybe it's only grete.

1288
01:44:16,792 --> 01:44:19,408
Only grete? She's even...

1289
01:44:24,633 --> 01:44:26,123
Mr. kemper?

1290
01:44:28,137 --> 01:44:31,220
Stop this nonsense
and open the door!

1291
01:44:33,309 --> 01:44:34,799
- I know that you're there!
- If we...

1292
01:44:35,853 --> 01:44:38,686
This is what happens
when they let people like you in.

1293
01:44:38,856 --> 01:44:40,346
Liars!

1294
01:44:42,109 --> 01:44:44,191
I have my eye on you, Mr. kemper!

1295
01:44:44,361 --> 01:44:46,727
You won't get past me without paying.

1296
01:44:46,906 --> 01:44:48,396
Dirty Jew.

1297
01:44:48,574 --> 01:44:50,064
That's degrading.

1298
01:44:55,623 --> 01:44:59,286
14, 15, 16, 17, 18...

1299
01:45:08,469 --> 01:45:09,754
Thank you, madame.

1300
01:45:13,808 --> 01:45:17,050
Madame, why is there money on my test?

1301
01:45:17,686 --> 01:45:19,972
Oh, right, I'd completely forgotten.

1302
01:45:20,147 --> 01:45:21,887
Children, listen to me.

1303
01:45:22,566 --> 01:45:26,650
Anna arrived only a year ago
and couldn't speak a word of French.

1304
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:30,191
Her spelling still leave
something to be desired,

1305
01:45:30,866 --> 01:45:34,358
but her essay
won the school competition.

1306
01:45:34,995 --> 01:45:38,704
Mr. moulin awarded her ten francs
for her journey story.

1307
01:45:38,958 --> 01:45:40,448
What do we say?

1308
01:45:43,337 --> 01:45:46,955
Anna, please come to the front
and read your story out loud.

1309
01:45:53,806 --> 01:45:56,218
"A journey". By Anna kemper.

1310
01:45:57,560 --> 01:46:00,472
"It was a cold February night.

1311
01:46:00,646 --> 01:46:02,557
Arthur had a bad cold.

1312
01:46:03,107 --> 01:46:04,938
He should have stayed in bed.

1313
01:46:05,901 --> 01:46:08,108
Suddenly the telephone rang.

1314
01:46:08,279 --> 01:46:11,487
I'm a friend, ' the voice said.

1315
01:46:11,991 --> 01:46:14,528
'And I have to warn you.'

1316
01:46:16,912 --> 01:46:18,903
I failed needlework,

1317
01:46:19,081 --> 01:46:20,867
but I did really well in sport.

1318
01:46:21,041 --> 01:46:23,157
We had to stand
on one leg for two minutes.

1319
01:46:23,335 --> 01:46:24,541
That was easy.

1320
01:46:24,795 --> 01:46:28,504
So being good at standing on one leg
makes up for how you sew?

1321
01:46:28,674 --> 01:46:31,541
Only at a girls' school!

1322
01:46:34,263 --> 01:46:36,128
Who's writing to papa from england?

1323
01:46:45,316 --> 01:46:47,602
Hello, miss grete.

1324
01:46:47,776 --> 01:46:49,516
And? Is it good?

1325
01:46:49,695 --> 01:46:51,310
Absolutely.

1326
01:46:51,488 --> 01:46:53,979
I'm top of my class. “Wonderful.

1327
01:46:54,158 --> 01:46:56,740
Anna got a gold medal
for standing on one leg.

1328
01:46:56,911 --> 01:46:59,323
Don't be stupid.
I won some money actually.

1329
01:46:59,496 --> 01:47:00,827
What for?

1330
01:47:00,998 --> 01:47:03,705
- I wrote about your journey.
- Show me.

1331
01:47:03,876 --> 01:47:06,538
You Jews always have to be the best,
don't you?

1332
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:17,677
- You have mail from england.
- Thanks.

1333
01:47:19,099 --> 01:47:22,341
- Shall I read you my story?
- Please do.

1334
01:47:22,519 --> 01:47:26,478
Math wasn't easy,
but I got 18 points there too.

1335
01:47:26,649 --> 01:47:28,480
Only me and one boy
in the 7th managed that.

1336
01:47:28,651 --> 01:47:31,939
Really?
I have such clever children.

1337
01:47:32,947 --> 01:47:35,359
"A journey by Anna kemper."

1338
01:47:35,532 --> 01:47:38,023
- They want to buy it.
- Who wants to buy what?

1339
01:47:38,202 --> 01:47:41,865
Napoleon.
The english want to buy my script.

1340
01:47:42,831 --> 01:47:44,992
They're paying good money too.

1341
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:54,957
Wow, this is amazing!

1342
01:47:57,262 --> 01:47:59,253
You get dizzy.

1343
01:48:03,102 --> 01:48:04,933
Watch out!

1344
01:48:05,646 --> 01:48:08,012
Dear balloon, fly to Berlin.
Good luck.

1345
01:48:12,194 --> 01:48:14,480
Think it will make it to Berlin?

1346
01:48:14,655 --> 01:48:16,691
Maybe it won't have to.

1347
01:48:18,575 --> 01:48:20,816
I think Julius is very close.

1348
01:48:25,541 --> 01:48:28,874
Look, it's already over les invalides,
Napoleon's tomb.

1349
01:48:32,214 --> 01:48:34,170
To Julius, my friend.

1350
01:48:37,302 --> 01:48:38,587
Now?

1351
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:40,093
Yes.

1352
01:48:41,598 --> 01:48:44,135
We've thought about moving to London.

1353
01:48:45,769 --> 01:48:48,476
There's just not enough work here.

1354
01:48:48,647 --> 01:48:50,808
Are you joking?

1355
01:48:50,983 --> 01:48:53,065
I've only just started to like it here.

1356
01:48:53,318 --> 01:48:55,900
And with this script job...

1357
01:48:56,155 --> 01:48:58,675
We could go ahead to London
and see if we can find an apartment.

1358
01:49:00,117 --> 01:49:02,153
You could board at school for two weeks.

1359
01:49:02,327 --> 01:49:04,033
No, we can't!

1360
01:49:04,204 --> 01:49:07,287
You can't leave us
alone in Paris for a single day!

1361
01:49:07,458 --> 01:49:08,538
But Anna...

1362
01:49:09,626 --> 01:49:13,960
Parents sometimes have to leave
their children alone for a short while.

1363
01:49:14,882 --> 01:49:17,214
In england many children
go to boarding school.

1364
01:49:17,384 --> 01:49:19,591
Those kids have a home
and we don't!

1365
01:49:19,845 --> 01:49:22,427
If you have no home,
you have to stay together!

1366
01:49:22,681 --> 01:49:24,797
Otherwise you get lost.

1367
01:49:24,975 --> 01:49:26,465
I agree, little man.

1368
01:49:26,643 --> 01:49:30,101
Don't call me that!
I'm not small and I'm not a man.

1369
01:49:36,987 --> 01:49:39,194
Can we never go back home?

1370
01:49:41,825 --> 01:49:43,656
I don't know.

1371
01:49:43,827 --> 01:49:45,613
Maybe one day.

1372
01:49:45,788 --> 01:49:47,244
But not now.

1373
01:49:57,424 --> 01:50:01,042
Maybe we'll never be at home
in one single place,

1374
01:50:04,348 --> 01:50:07,055
but a little bit at home
in many different places.

1375
01:50:14,399 --> 01:50:16,060
That could be nice too.

1376
01:50:17,027 --> 01:50:18,767
Well...

1377
01:51:02,531 --> 01:51:04,112
Excuse me.

1378
01:51:16,044 --> 01:51:17,955
Goodbye, gray house.

1379
01:51:19,256 --> 01:51:21,167
Goodbye, rue de la victoire.

1380
01:51:21,425 --> 01:51:23,837
Give me that. I'll put it in the back.

1381
01:51:28,515 --> 01:51:30,631
- Hello Arthur.
- Hello.

1382
01:51:33,687 --> 01:51:35,894
There's something I wanted to say.

1383
01:51:50,579 --> 01:51:52,615
What did you say to madame prune?

1384
01:51:52,873 --> 01:51:54,488
That's between me and her.

1385
01:52:29,201 --> 01:52:31,817
That's english.
Understand anything?

1386
01:52:31,995 --> 01:52:33,656
Not a word.

1387
01:52:34,915 --> 01:52:37,031
We're back to square one.

1388
01:52:37,834 --> 01:52:40,826
We don't know anyone
and don't understand anything.

1389
01:52:41,088 --> 01:52:42,919
What odd customs do the english have?

1390
01:52:44,883 --> 01:52:49,047
I can't wait to eat a lovely piece
of old cheese in London tonight.

1391
01:53:00,357 --> 01:53:04,225
I don't understand a word,
but it doesn't matter.

1392
01:53:04,403 --> 01:53:07,611
Because soon,
soon I will understand it all.

1393
01:53:22,838 --> 01:53:26,501
In 1935 Judith kerr and her family
emigrated to england.

1394
01:53:28,176 --> 01:53:30,542
After the war she studied art

1395
01:53:30,721 --> 01:53:33,303
and worked
as an illustrator of children's books.

1396
01:53:34,850 --> 01:53:36,806
Her brother Michael studied law

1397
01:53:36,977 --> 01:53:40,765
and became the first foreign-born judge
of the high court of justice.

1398
01:53:42,316 --> 01:53:46,275
"When Hitler stole pink rabbit"
was translated into 20 languages

1399
01:53:46,445 --> 01:53:48,436
and made Judith kerr world-famous.

1400
01:53:49,489 --> 01:53:54,028
Judith kerr died in may 2019
at the age of 95 in London.

1401
01:53:56,204 --> 01:54:01,915
There she had found the home
she had longed for.

1402
01:54:07,758 --> 01:54:12,001
Alfred and Judith kerr, 1934
