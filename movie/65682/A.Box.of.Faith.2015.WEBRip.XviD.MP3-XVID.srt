1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:03,737
(light hearted jingle)

2
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:15,916
(melancholic music)

3
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:19,380
- [Tim] How was school?

4
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,548
- [Dior] It was okay.

5
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:21,849
- [Tim] Any homework?

6
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:23,217
- [Dior] Did it.

7
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:25,353
- [Tim] Anything
interesting happen?

8
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:28,756
- [Dior] A kid got mad at
his mom over a kale salad.

9
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:31,159
He called her the B word.

10
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:33,461
- [Tim] If my father found
out I called my mom that --

11
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:36,164
- He'd wash your
mouth out with soap.

12
00:01:36,164 --> 00:01:37,498
- He probably didn|t mean it.

13
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:39,233
- No, he meant it.

14
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:42,903
He wanted a sandwich,
not a salad.

15
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:44,538
- How was your sandwich?

16
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,073
- It was good.

17
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:49,009
- Not as good as your mom|s?

18
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,911
- No.

19
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,380
- You didn|t eat it?

20
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,081
- (laughing) No.

21
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,649
- [Tim] It was that bad?

22
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,818
- No, I traded it for a salad.

23
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,416
- I was thinking, we
should head north again

24
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:05,253
and take a little vacation.

25
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:07,655
Get a boat, cruise the lake.

26
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:09,957
Maybe we could rent
one of those cabins.

27
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:11,892
Wouldn'|t that be fun?

28
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:14,127
- That|'d be amazing.

29
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:18,832
- Oh, check your ticket.

30
00:03:28,276 --> 00:03:30,744
Did you win?

31
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:33,914
- We won another
free chicken basket.

32
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:36,684
- You'|re the luckiest
person I'|ve ever known.

33
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,791
Not much to sell
in here any more.

34
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:39,046
Your mom loved that thing.

35
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:41,349
You should take it.

36
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:44,217
I know she'd love
for you to have it.

37
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,106
- I'|ll give you 50 for it.

38
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,408
- 50?

39
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:09,076
Cost close to 400.

40
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:12,380
- I| got a lot of watches
and they|'re not selling.

41
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,247
- How much do you sell them for?

42
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,282
- This one?

43
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:16,450
About 150.

44
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,419
- Nice markup.

45
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,021
- You want the 50 bucks or not?

46
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:25,158
- Fine.

47
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,560
- All right, fill
out this paperwork.

48
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,529
I|'ll go get your money.

49
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,874
- [Tim] This motel is
costing me 55 bucks a night.

50
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:44,545
I can|'t do this much
longer, I need our home back.

51
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:49,417
If we give you another
500 this Friday,

52
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:51,719
can we move back in?

53
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:53,621
I don'|t have 750.

54
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:57,791
Okay, I'|ll get it.

55
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,428
Just, don'|t rent it, please.

56
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:03,931
(melancholic music)

57
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,004
My peace I give unto you.

58
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:47,608
Not as the world
giveth, give I unto you.

59
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:51,812
Let not your heart be troubled,
neither let it be afraid.

60
00:07:00,488 --> 00:07:04,024
(grinding)

61
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:11,164
(ominous music)

62
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,828
Night, Terry.

63
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:48,836
- Have a great weekend, Mark.

64
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,437
- You, too, Ben. Thanks.

65
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:52,439
- Later, Mark.

66
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:02,983
- Sorry, Tim.

67
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,052
I|'m gonna have to report this.

68
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:10,791
- So what should
we do about this?

69
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:11,925
- I didn'|t put that there.

70
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:14,094
- Well then who did?

71
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:16,396
- I don'|t know.

72
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:20,634
- I took a chance on you.

73
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,636
And this is how you pay me back?

74
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:25,739
- I didn'|t put it there,
I'm telling the truth.

75
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:32,245
- This is your original
job application.

76
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:35,348
"Have you ever been
convicted of a felony?"

77
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:39,587
And you wrote, "Yes,
class 6, non-violent."

78
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,690
- That was 17 years ago.

79
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:47,227
I was a stupid kid running
with the wrong crowd.

80
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,830
- Did you know that
74% of employees

81
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,600
steal from their employers?

82
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,068
- Come on Ben,
what'|s going on here?

83
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:57,771
You know me.

84
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,607
I'|m telling the truth,
I didn'|t put it there.

85
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:04,177
- And one out of 30 employees
are arrested for theft.

86
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,146
- You'|re not listening to me.

87
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,215
I'|m being set up.

88
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:12,085
- And over 50% are men.

89
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:16,456
You fit the mold,
and I trusted you.

90
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:19,492
- So I|'m fired?

91
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,094
- Fired?

92
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:24,998
No, you'|re going to jail.

93
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,869
I|'ve already called the police.

94
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,207
(birds chirping)

95
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:44,117
(upbeat music)

96
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,702
- [Voiceover] I was told they
checked in here 2 days ago.

97
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:35,836
- [Voiceover] Yeah, but
his truck'|s not here.

98
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,137
How could anyone get in there?

99
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,638
- I need to check inside.

100
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,273
- No, I'|ve got to protect
the privacy of my guests.

101
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,608
- Can you open the door?

102
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:42,810
- [Motel Manager] No.

103
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,745
- [Ms. Ward] Do
you have children?

104
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:46,046
- Yeah, I have a daughter.

105
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:47,981
- Okay, how would you
feel if your daughter

106
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,517
was living out on the streets?

107
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,556
- Thank you.

108
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,869
Dior?

109
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:11,071
Are you in here?

110
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:19,379
- See, she'|s not here.

111
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:32,760
Hey, I don'|t feel
comfortable with you

112
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,827
going through that stuff.

113
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:36,596
- Oh right, protecting
their privacy.

114
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:47,941
Look, I really need to
find this girl soon.

115
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:50,778
So if you see her, can
you call me immediately?

116
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:53,113
Here|'s my card, okay?

117
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:54,815
- Is she in some
kind of trouble?

118
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:57,350
- No, she isn'|t in
any kind of trouble.

119
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,452
Her father is.

120
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,255
Her mother passed away,
she has no other family.

121
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,523
She'|ll be in our
custody until we

122
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,358
find a foster home for her.

123
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,660
So please, can you call
the number on the card?

124
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,830
I'|ll come pick her
up straight away.

125
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,031
Can you at least do that for me?

126
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:13,033
- Okay, I'|ll call you.

127
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:15,002
- Okay.

128
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:10,891
(light hearted music)

129
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:23,196
- Lord, help me
through this experience

130
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,966
and I'll be a great
warrior for you.

131
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:38,946
- Okay.

132
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:40,347
Uh huh.

133
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:44,584
Well, if she does show up,
can you give me a call please?

134
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:48,255
Thanks, bye bye.

135
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:39,306
(phone ringing)

136
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:41,274
- Hey, I just got an
update on the father.

137
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,543
- Hold on, I'|m gonna pull over.

138
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,917
Okay, go ahead, Steven.

139
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,719
- This is his second felony.

140
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,587
- Right, I know, what else?

141
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,789
- His boss is not
letting up on this.

142
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,891
The bail is set at 25,000.

143
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,196
The judge is pushing
for three to five.

144
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:04,464
- Three to five?

145
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,866
Seems extreme, no parole?

146
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:09,369
- I don'|t think so.

147
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:11,404
- Why are they being
so harsh on him?

148
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:12,572
- It|'s the employer.

149
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:15,575
He'|s trying to make
an example of him.

150
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:19,146
You there?

151
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,481
- Do you think you
might be able to arrange

152
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,217
a meeting with Strickland?

153
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:26,086
- I|'ll see what I can do.

154
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:28,121
- Cheers, Steven.

155
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:51,644
(upbeat music)

156
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,415
- That|'s my bag!

157
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:57,417
(car horn)

158
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:03,723
(car horn)

159
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:01,681
(relaxed music)

160
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:33,280
(background TV)

161
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:02,209
What are you doing?

162
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:05,212
Give that back to me!

163
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:07,113
What do you mean no?

164
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:08,581
It|'s mine!

165
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:12,319
That was my mother'|s.

166
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,554
It means a lot to me.

167
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,593
Thank you.

168
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:27,834
Wait, do you want this?

169
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,771
Take it.

170
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,615
Thank you.

171
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,831
Thank you.

172
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,246
Where are my clothes?

173
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:05,898
- Have any of the staff
been in here recently?

174
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:07,066
- No.

175
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:08,968
- Huh.

176
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:10,670
She'|s been in here.

177
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,705
- I don'|t think so.

178
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:15,207
- Well, somebody has.

179
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:39,265
- Listen, I gotta get
back to the front desk.

180
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:40,767
This door will lock
when you leave.

181
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,435
- Okay.

182
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:47,974
(door closing)

183
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:53,713
"Dior, you will always
be my baby girl.

184
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:58,518
"I am so proud of you
and how you are able

185
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:01,888
"to inspire everyone around you.

186
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:07,394
"Keep up the great
work and be strong.

187
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:12,264
"Love, Mom."

188
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,078
There you are.

189
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,899
Come on, Dior, where are you?

190
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:26,973
(relaxed music)

191
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:32,705
(car engine)

192
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:44,651
(tense music)

193
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:56,428
(door unlocking)

194
00:24:56,428 --> 00:25:00,099
(banging)

195
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:03,402
(door closing)

196
00:25:13,913 --> 00:25:17,917
(background TV)

197
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:29,028
Where are you hiding?

198
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:20,012
- [Voiceover] Dear
God, thank you

199
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:23,349
for the wonderful home
you|'ve given me today.

200
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:25,317
I don'|t question
you, but I wonder

201
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,720
how long you need my dad.

202
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,922
Hope it'|s not long.

203
00:26:31,858 --> 00:26:33,926
I know you have
some plan for him,

204
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:37,664
so I will be patient and
stay here until he returns.

205
00:26:37,664 --> 00:26:39,666
Love, Dior.

206
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:44,070
(storm rumbling)

207
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:28,047
(unsettled music)

208
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,005
- [Manager] I've gotta protect
the privacy of my guests.

209
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:27,139
- [Ms. Ward] Can
you open the door?

210
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:28,440
- [Motel Manager] No.

211
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,395
(car horn)

212
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:13,412
- [Voiceover] You can
stop following me.

213
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:15,114
I'm doing fine.

214
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:17,383
God takes care of me.

215
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:47,980
- [Voiceover] Dear Dior,
I mean you no harm.

216
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,750
I only want to help you and put
you in a place that is safe.

217
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,720
I just ask that you trust me.

218
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,958
P.S. thanks for the
help with my crossword.

219
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,381
- Hey, Ray?

220
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:57,749
Can you pick me up?

221
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,252
I need to leave
my car somewhere.

222
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:15,234
(scratching)

223
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:20,206
(rattling)

224
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:38,424
(rattling)

225
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:48,500
(playful music)

226
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:53,039
- Hi, there.

227
00:32:54,273 --> 00:32:57,143
Boy, you'|re a fat
one, aren'|t you?

228
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:06,118
'Futt'.

229
00:33:06,118 --> 00:33:08,554
What kind of name is that?

230
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:15,061
Well Futt, I think you
found yourself a new home.

231
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:22,801
Well, of course you'|re
hungry, pudgy boy.

232
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:27,639
(background TV)

233
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:47,493
- [Voiceover] Dear God, thank
you for my new companion.

234
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:49,228
He's great.

235
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:51,597
I think he eats more than
me, so whatever extra help

236
00:33:51,597 --> 00:33:54,300
you can afford would
be greatly appreciated.

237
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,102
Love, Dior.

238
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:16,822
(pleasant music)

239
00:34:42,148 --> 00:34:44,216
- Come on.

240
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:47,519
You|'re not going to be able
to keep up with me, are you?

241
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:49,288
Come on.

242
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:02,468
(upbeat music)

243
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:21,753
- Look, I|'m really
sorry about being late.

244
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:23,088
- You don|t understand.

245
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:26,192
This girl has been
really difficult to find.

246
00:35:26,192 --> 00:35:29,961
I left her a note, I want to
be there when she finds it.

247
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,530
- Why don'|t you let
the cops find her?

248
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,800
- They won|'t, this
is one smart girl.

249
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:50,216
- Looks like she might
have left us a note.

250
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:54,085
I'|ll be right back, okay?

251
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:52,278
- Well?

252
00:36:52,278 --> 00:36:54,646
- She left me a note.

253
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:56,315
- "I don'|t need your
help, I'|m doing what I

254
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:59,585
"need to do until
my father returns."

255
00:36:59,585 --> 00:37:02,421
- That|'s gonna be a long wait.

256
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:05,624
- "Thank you for the money,
but God watches over me."

257
00:37:05,624 --> 00:37:07,826
- You gave her money?

258
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:14,433
I can'|t believe
you gave her money.

259
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:17,669
- I'|ll see you back
at the office, Ray.

260
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:20,406
- Okay.

261
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:56,908
- Where you going?

262
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:17,228
Think she'|s setting
me up, Futtman?

263
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:20,899
Stay here.

264
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:40,652
- [Voiceover] Dear Dior, I
don'|t think you understand

265
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,788
what is going on here.

266
00:38:42,788 --> 00:38:45,891
Your father may be
gone for a few years.

267
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:48,159
He is going to prison.

268
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:52,230
Please just give me five
minutes so I can explain.

269
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:29,901
- You wanna talk?

270
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:33,304
- About what?

271
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,239
- Oh I don'|t know, maybe about

272
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,474
you making this too personal?

273
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:37,443
- Oh, and you don|'t
care about these kids?

274
00:39:37,443 --> 00:39:38,877
- Of course I do.

275
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,812
I just know how to keep
it separate from my life.

276
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:42,681
- This is my life.

277
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:45,451
These kids need a chance.

278
00:39:45,451 --> 00:39:47,986
- Yes, and that'|s
where we come in.

279
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:49,455
- That doesn'|t fix it.

280
00:39:49,455 --> 00:39:51,923
What, you think because
we put them in foster care

281
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:55,226
or we take them from their
parents it'|s all better, Ray?

282
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,161
- I didn'|t say that.

283
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:57,663
- Well, what are you saying?

284
00:39:57,663 --> 00:39:58,997
- I'|m saying, we
do the best we can

285
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:00,999
with what we have to work with.

286
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:04,636
If these kids choose
to do something with
themselves, great.

287
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:07,372
If they don'|t,
it|'s not our fault.

288
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:09,140
It|'s not your fault.

289
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,077
- That|'s just
giving up on them.

290
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:14,846
- It|'s just a job.

291
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:18,517
- Not to me.

292
00:40:19,485 --> 00:40:22,521
- I think there's more to this
than what you|'re telling me.

293
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:24,490
- She just deserves better.

294
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:29,595
- Are you sure we'|re
not talking about you?

295
00:40:29,595 --> 00:40:32,564
Why are you so
interested in this case?

296
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:34,032
- She lost her mother.

297
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:35,834
Her father|'s going to prison.

298
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:38,970
She has no relatives,
no siblings, no one.

299
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,640
- All of these children
have similar situations.

300
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,475
- No, this one is different.

301
00:40:43,475 --> 00:40:44,876
She'|s incredibly intelligent.

302
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:45,744
She'|s gifted.

303
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:47,579
- And what about Jose?

304
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,147
Or Aaron?

305
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:50,549
Or Shantell?

306
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:52,584
What, they'|re not?

307
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:55,954
- Look, maybe you'|re right.

308
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:58,490
- It'|s not about me
being right or wrong.

309
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,792
- Some of these kids
don'|t wanna make anything

310
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:04,095
of their lives, but
not this kid, Ray!

311
00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:09,267
- I think you'|re
getting a little too

312
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:11,136
attached to this case.

313
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:13,271
- It'|s not a case, Ray.

314
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:16,341
It'|s a person.

315
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:19,444
A young girl who
deserves a chance

316
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:23,348
to lead a better life,
to grow up and have

317
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:27,553
an impact on
people|s lives, okay?

318
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:40,966
- Looks like we'|re gonna
be here a while, Futtman.

319
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:44,269
We need a plan.

320
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:47,372
(relaxed music)

321
00:43:42,688 --> 00:43:45,256
- Where have you gone?

322
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:15,921
- Any luck?

323
00:44:15,921 --> 00:44:19,224
- No, it|'s like she vanished.

324
00:44:19,224 --> 00:44:21,059
- You know she can probably
see you sitting here

325
00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:23,494
watching the car, right?

326
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,197
- Did you come here to
give me a hard time?

327
00:44:26,197 --> 00:44:27,298
- No, I|'m just saying she can

328
00:44:27,298 --> 00:44:30,468
probably see you, that'|s all.

329
00:44:30,468 --> 00:44:33,739
- [Ms. Ward] Do you
think I don'|t know that?

330
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:35,606
- Why don'|t you move
farther away from the car?

331
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:37,743
Like over there?

332
00:44:37,743 --> 00:44:40,311
- Do I tell you
how to do your job?

333
00:44:42,748 --> 00:44:44,382
- No.

334
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:48,186
- Ray, why are you here?

335
00:44:50,488 --> 00:44:51,790
- They'|re gonna
move her father to an

336
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:53,591
out-of-state facility.

337
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:03,334
Are you gonna stay here all day?

338
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:06,471
- If that'|s what it takes.

339
00:45:06,471 --> 00:45:08,940
- See you back at the office.

340
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:12,477
- Goodbye, Ray.

341
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:32,063
Why didn'|t you tell
me they're moving him?

342
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,899
- I left a message with Ray.

343
00:45:33,899 --> 00:45:35,033
- I|'ve read his report.

344
00:45:35,033 --> 00:45:36,802
This guy shouldn'|t
even be in jail.

345
00:45:36,802 --> 00:45:38,269
- Look, I|'m as
surprised as you are.

346
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:41,639
But I gotta tell you, he'|s
not getting out any time soon.

347
00:45:46,812 --> 00:45:48,479
- I need to meet him.

348
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:49,815
- So you|'re serious?

349
00:45:49,815 --> 00:45:52,350
- Yeah.

350
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,852
Can you arrange a meeting?

351
00:45:53,852 --> 00:45:55,220
- All right, we have
to do it right away

352
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:57,923
'cause they'|re moving
him pretty soon.

353
00:45:59,858 --> 00:46:01,292
- Okay, yeah.

354
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:02,227
Cheers, Steven.

355
00:46:02,227 --> 00:46:03,962
Call me when you set it up, bye.

356
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:46,204
- [Voiceover] Dear Dior,
I'|m sure you'|ve been

357
00:46:46,204 --> 00:46:49,640
looking everywhere for
this photo of your mom.

358
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,009
I thought the need to tell you

359
00:46:51,009 --> 00:46:54,145
a little about
myself was necessary.

360
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:56,982
I know what you
are going through.

361
00:46:56,982 --> 00:46:59,284
I lost my mother and
have no idea where my

362
00:46:59,284 --> 00:47:02,020
father is even to this day.

363
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:05,991
So when I say I know
how you feel, I mean it,

364
00:47:05,991 --> 00:47:09,327
because I|'ve been
in your shoes.

365
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:14,132
I know you say God takes care
of you and I believe he does.

366
00:47:14,132 --> 00:47:17,802
But maybe God is
directing me to you.

367
00:47:17,802 --> 00:47:21,940
I will not give up on you
and I pray that you are safe.

368
00:47:25,911 --> 00:47:27,812
- Hey, Ray.

369
00:47:32,483 --> 00:47:33,518
Listen Ray, I'|m sorry.

370
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:35,586
I lost track of time.

371
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:39,524
I spotted the girl so I know
she|'s around here somewhere.

372
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:41,626
Ray, did you hear what I said?

373
00:47:41,626 --> 00:47:44,129
I just saw Dior, I can'|t leave.

374
00:47:48,433 --> 00:47:50,835
Bye, Ray, look I gotta go.

375
00:48:15,093 --> 00:48:19,230
(melancholic music)

376
00:48:25,103 --> 00:48:26,404
Hello, Dior.

377
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:28,106
- Hi.

378
00:48:28,106 --> 00:48:31,977
- It|'s nice to
finally meet you.

379
00:48:31,977 --> 00:48:33,678
I'|m trying everything
I can to get in touch

380
00:48:33,678 --> 00:48:36,347
with your father.

381
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:42,988
- The only way across
is way down there.

382
00:48:42,988 --> 00:48:45,991
- And if I go down there,
you'|ll run away, won|'t you?

383
00:48:45,991 --> 00:48:47,592
- Probably.

384
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:49,327
- I could call the police
and have this place

385
00:48:49,327 --> 00:48:51,596
surrounded, you know.

386
00:48:52,998 --> 00:48:55,333
You don|'t belong out here.

387
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:57,002
- And if I go with you,
you'|ll just stick me

388
00:48:57,002 --> 00:48:59,737
somewhere where people
don'|t care about me.

389
00:48:59,737 --> 00:49:02,640
- I can see there'|s no
talking you into it, is there?

390
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,044
- I|'ve got everything
I need right here.

391
00:49:06,044 --> 00:49:08,913
He takes care of me.

392
00:49:08,913 --> 00:49:11,249
- What|'s his name?

393
00:49:11,249 --> 00:49:12,250
- Futt.

394
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,185
- Sorry, what'|s his name?

395
00:49:14,185 --> 00:49:16,254
- Futt, F - U - T - T.

396
00:49:16,254 --> 00:49:18,656
- What kind of name
is that for a dog?

397
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:20,091
- It|'s on his collar.

398
00:49:20,091 --> 00:49:22,560
(Ms. Ward laughs)

399
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,796
- So he belongs to somebody?

400
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:26,497
- Probably.

401
00:49:26,497 --> 00:49:28,533
- Just like you.

402
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:33,071
- I should get going.

403
00:49:33,071 --> 00:49:36,307
- At least let me give you
some money for a motel.

404
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:39,610
- I don|'t need any money,
I|'ve got it all under control.

405
00:49:41,046 --> 00:49:42,547
I have a place to live.

406
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:44,682
- Oh, you do, where?

407
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:48,486
It was worth a shot, right?

408
00:49:50,055 --> 00:49:52,157
Dior?

409
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:55,060
I|'m sorry to hear
about your mother.

410
00:49:57,062 --> 00:49:59,697
- I|'m sorry to
hear about yours.

411
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:01,666
- I'|ll be checking on you.

412
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:05,803
You know, make
sure you'|re okay.

413
00:50:05,803 --> 00:50:07,872
- Okay.

414
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:40,805
- He likes ice cream, huh?

415
00:50:40,805 --> 00:50:42,673
- He likes everything.

416
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:45,943
- Looks like he can
use some exercise.

417
00:50:45,943 --> 00:50:48,979
Why do you have him
in that stroller?

418
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:52,383
- Well, he can|'t
keep up with me.

419
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:55,052
- So how long you
been on the street?

420
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,488
- Who says I live on the street?

421
00:50:57,488 --> 00:51:00,191
- Well it|'s pretty obvious.

422
00:51:00,191 --> 00:51:02,860
You don'|t wanna look obvious.

423
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:06,397
You wanna blend in,
otherwise they'|ll see you.

424
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:08,199
- Blend in?

425
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:10,401
- That|'s what I do.

426
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,175
Here.

427
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:26,951
How long has it been
since you'|ve eaten?

428
00:51:26,951 --> 00:51:29,987
- I couldn'|t find
any food yesterday.

429
00:51:32,056 --> 00:51:34,192
- Here you go.

430
00:51:39,797 --> 00:51:41,232
So where do you sleep?

431
00:51:41,232 --> 00:51:43,401
- Under the bridge.

432
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:45,636
- That|'s not very safe.

433
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:48,173
- Where do you sleep?

434
00:51:48,173 --> 00:51:49,874
- Well, I have a place.

435
00:51:49,874 --> 00:51:50,808
And you'|re welcome
to stay with me

436
00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:52,710
until you figure things out.

437
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:02,086
- You live here?

438
00:52:02,086 --> 00:52:04,555
- Shh, we gotta keep quiet.

439
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:15,866
- So I can stay here?

440
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:19,003
- Yeah, I have a sleeping
bag that you can use.

441
00:52:19,003 --> 00:52:21,105
- [Girl] Cool, thanks.

442
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:28,112
- We just have to be
careful coming and going.

443
00:52:28,112 --> 00:52:30,581
I mean, if anybody knew
that we were living here,

444
00:52:30,581 --> 00:52:32,583
it'|d be over.

445
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:34,652
And I do ask that you
spend a couple of hours

446
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:36,387
keeping up with
your school studies.

447
00:52:36,387 --> 00:52:38,489
- School studies?

448
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:40,858
- Yeah, everyday.

449
00:52:40,858 --> 00:52:42,360
You okay with that?

450
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,895
- Sure, why not?

451
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,667
Well, everything was
good until my mom

452
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,802
and dad got divorced.

453
00:52:51,802 --> 00:52:55,373
Minute that happened,
my dad moved away.

454
00:52:55,373 --> 00:52:57,608
Then my mom married this,

455
00:52:57,608 --> 00:53:00,378
I don'|t even know
what you|'d call him.

456
00:53:00,378 --> 00:53:03,748
He was nice at first, but
then he became a jerk.

457
00:53:03,748 --> 00:53:06,784
My mom acted like it
was nothing at all.

458
00:53:06,784 --> 00:53:09,487
So I was like,
"I|'m outta here."

459
00:53:09,487 --> 00:53:13,157
- I|'m sorry to hear that.

460
00:53:13,157 --> 00:53:14,392
- What about you?

461
00:53:14,392 --> 00:53:16,927
Why do you live in
this storage unit?

462
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,697
- My dad's in some
kind of trouble.

463
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:23,268
And they wanna put
me in foster home,

464
00:53:23,268 --> 00:53:25,270
but they can'|t catch me.

465
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:28,706
- Why don'|t you
live with your mom?

466
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:31,041
- She died.

467
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:35,145
There is a woman that|'s
trying to take care of me.

468
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:38,716
I think she'|s from
the state or something.

469
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:39,717
But I just don'|t
want to live in some

470
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:42,287
stranger|'s house, you know?

471
00:53:42,287 --> 00:53:44,489
I have everything
I need right here.

472
00:53:44,489 --> 00:53:46,691
- How did you score this place?

473
00:53:46,691 --> 00:53:49,694
- It'|s my dad'|s storage unit.

474
00:53:49,694 --> 00:53:53,364
- How do you have all
that food and stuff?

475
00:53:53,364 --> 00:53:55,666
- Well, he helps me.

476
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:58,135
Plus, there are
ways to make money.

477
00:53:58,135 --> 00:54:01,572
You just have to work
hard and pay attention.

478
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:04,375
So what do you
want in your life?

479
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:08,746
- I guess, for things to be
back to the way they were.

480
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:11,616
- You want things
to be resolved?

481
00:54:11,616 --> 00:54:12,850
- Well, yeah.

482
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:16,321
But that won|'t happen
while he'|s around.

483
00:54:18,723 --> 00:54:21,626
- What if I told you
that miracles can happen?

484
00:54:21,626 --> 00:54:24,094
- I'|d say that
you'|re full of it.

485
00:54:27,832 --> 00:54:29,934
What'|s that?

486
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:33,338
I found it in my mom|'s things.

487
00:54:33,338 --> 00:54:35,606
But basically this
is how it works.

488
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:39,410
You write a note to God,
you put it on the ceiling,

489
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:41,779
and then in the
night, he takes it.

490
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:45,950
In time, all your
problems get worked out.

491
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:48,586
- That|'s the stupidest
thing I ever heard of.

492
00:54:48,586 --> 00:54:50,355
- Well, it'|s true.

493
00:54:50,355 --> 00:54:52,823
- And then all your
problems are solved?

494
00:54:52,823 --> 00:54:55,526
- Yeah.

495
00:54:55,526 --> 00:54:59,630
Try it, what have
you got to lose?

496
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,432
- I think that you'|re crazy.

497
00:55:01,432 --> 00:55:04,234
- Think what you
want, but it works.

498
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:05,903
- Prove it.

499
00:55:05,903 --> 00:55:08,706
- Write a note to God and
ask for some sort of help

500
00:55:08,706 --> 00:55:11,442
for something in your life.

501
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,881
- This is stupid.

502
00:55:16,881 --> 00:55:20,585
- Just close your
eyes and think.

503
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:22,987
- Okay.

504
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:24,389
Got it.

505
00:55:24,389 --> 00:55:27,157
- Write it down and make
sure it|'s addressed to him.

506
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:30,861
- "God, please give me
a new pair of shoes."

507
00:55:31,929 --> 00:55:34,932
- Okay, now it'|s my turn.

508
00:55:38,903 --> 00:55:41,506
"Dear God,

509
00:55:41,506 --> 00:55:45,710
"thanks for my new friend.

510
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:48,178
"Love, Dior."

511
00:55:49,914 --> 00:55:52,517
- You didn'|t ask for anything.

512
00:55:52,517 --> 00:55:53,684
- Well sometimes
I just thank him

513
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:56,687
for all that he|'s done for me.

514
00:56:21,145 --> 00:56:22,680
Now put it up there.

515
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,450
And make sure the
words are facing up.

516
00:56:36,494 --> 00:56:38,463
- So what do we do now?

517
00:56:38,463 --> 00:56:40,798
- We wait until morning.

518
00:56:51,576 --> 00:56:54,645
- Do you ever miss your mom?

519
00:56:57,482 --> 00:57:00,485
- Every day.

520
00:57:00,485 --> 00:57:01,819
The hardest part is
that I'|ll never be able

521
00:57:01,819 --> 00:57:04,889
to talk to her ever again.

522
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:07,992
- What was she like?

523
00:57:07,992 --> 00:57:10,761
- Smart.

524
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:14,398
Funny.

525
00:57:14,398 --> 00:57:17,568
And strong.

526
00:57:17,568 --> 00:57:20,370
She liked to hug me a lot.

527
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:24,241
- She sounds nice.

528
00:57:26,511 --> 00:57:28,779
- She was.

529
00:57:41,425 --> 00:57:42,893
- Hey, wake up.

530
00:57:42,893 --> 00:57:45,129
Wake up.

531
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:48,398
One of them is still there.

532
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:51,035
Yours is gone but
mine's still there.

533
00:57:52,002 --> 00:57:55,573
- I don'|t understand
what happened.

534
00:57:57,174 --> 00:57:59,910
- I don'|t believe
in it anyways.

535
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:08,853
(buzzer)
(door unlocking)

536
00:58:08,853 --> 00:58:11,956
(ominous music)

537
00:58:13,257 --> 00:58:14,692
- Step forward.

538
00:58:34,311 --> 00:58:37,247
- Mr. Strickland, my name
is Ms. Ward and I'm from

539
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:40,117
child protective services.
- [Tim] How's my daughter?

540
00:58:40,117 --> 00:58:43,754
- She|'s, your daughter'|s fine.

541
00:58:43,754 --> 00:58:46,691
But I was hoping that you
might know where she is.

542
00:58:46,691 --> 00:58:47,658
- What do you mean?

543
00:58:47,658 --> 00:58:48,726
You don|t know where she is?

544
00:58:48,726 --> 00:58:50,427
- I ran into her in the park.

545
00:58:50,427 --> 00:58:51,729
- In the park?

546
00:58:51,729 --> 00:58:53,497
- She looked okay.

547
00:58:53,497 --> 00:58:56,934
I just don|t know where
she'|s living at the moment.

548
00:58:56,934 --> 00:58:58,603
- Did you check the motel?

549
00:58:58,603 --> 00:59:01,371
- Yes, she|'s gone
somewhere else.

550
00:59:02,807 --> 00:59:04,975
- So you guy|s lost her?

551
00:59:04,975 --> 00:59:07,978
You don|'t have any idea
what you'|re doing, do you?

552
00:59:09,446 --> 00:59:10,715
- Wait a minute here.

553
00:59:10,715 --> 00:59:13,618
I|'m not the one who put
a tool in my lunch box.

554
00:59:13,618 --> 00:59:15,252
- I didn|'t steal anything.

555
00:59:15,252 --> 00:59:18,355
- Tim, they found stolen
property in your lunch box.

556
00:59:18,355 --> 00:59:21,158
- So now we'|re on
a first name basis?

557
00:59:22,693 --> 00:59:25,462
- I|'m sorry if the system
has put you in a bad spot.

558
00:59:25,462 --> 00:59:27,765
- The system is responsible
for a 16 year old girl

559
00:59:27,765 --> 00:59:28,933
wandering the streets.

560
00:59:28,933 --> 00:59:30,500
- I absolutely agree.

561
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,037
That|'s why I want to find her.

562
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:36,941
- And what are you gonna do
with her if you find her?

563
00:59:36,941 --> 00:59:39,777
- We'|ll take her to a
place where she|'ll be safe.

564
00:59:39,777 --> 00:59:42,379
- Safe.

565
00:59:42,379 --> 00:59:46,283
In a halfway house full
of runaway street kids.

566
00:59:47,718 --> 00:59:49,053
- Fine.

567
00:59:49,053 --> 00:59:51,355
You know, thanks for your help.

568
00:59:52,957 --> 00:59:55,660
- [Tim] What do you wanna know?

569
01:00:04,969 --> 01:00:08,005
- Anything you can
tell me about her.

570
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:12,076
- She|'s been through a lot.

571
01:00:12,076 --> 01:00:16,246
She lost her mom two years ago.

572
01:00:16,246 --> 01:00:18,649
She|'s intelligent.

573
01:00:18,649 --> 01:00:20,084
That|'s why you'|re
not going to find her

574
01:00:20,084 --> 01:00:22,853
unless she wants you to.

575
01:00:22,853 --> 01:00:26,090
Never had to push
her to do anything.

576
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:29,426
She'|s really focused.

577
01:00:29,426 --> 01:00:31,829
She'|s smart.

578
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:34,398
So smart.

579
01:00:34,398 --> 01:00:37,034
Smarter than I am.

580
01:00:40,104 --> 01:00:43,473
She|'s gonna be
something someday.

581
01:00:46,777 --> 01:00:51,081
- I can tell you love
your daughter very much.

582
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:56,186
- I|'ve let her down.

583
01:01:03,527 --> 01:01:08,298
- Do you know where
she might| have gone?

584
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:12,236
With a relative or
maybe a boyfriend?

585
01:01:12,236 --> 01:01:13,871
- No.

586
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:20,210
Just remember, she|'s
very resourceful.

587
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:22,747
- Tim, I'|m gonna find her.

588
01:01:22,747 --> 01:01:24,114
- [Dior] Okay, so
after the cells divide,

589
01:01:24,114 --> 01:01:26,784
what'|s that phase called?

590
01:01:26,784 --> 01:01:29,453
- I really don|t
wanna do this anymore.

591
01:01:30,755 --> 01:01:32,656
- But you agreed to the rules.

592
01:01:32,656 --> 01:01:35,625
- So if I don'|t do your
rules then I have to leave?

593
01:01:37,127 --> 01:01:38,328
- You think that just
because you ran away

594
01:01:38,328 --> 01:01:40,430
you can'|t think
about your future?

595
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:43,934
- You|'re starting
to sound like my mom.

596
01:01:45,469 --> 01:01:47,938
- Well this isn'|t it for me.

597
01:01:47,938 --> 01:01:49,573
I'm gonna make
something of myself.

598
01:01:49,573 --> 01:01:50,607
- Well why don|'t you
go to school if it'|s

599
01:01:50,607 --> 01:01:52,877
so important to you?

600
01:01:52,877 --> 01:01:54,311
- Well that'|s out
of the question.

601
01:01:54,311 --> 01:01:57,948
But, you did agree to study
if I let you stay here.

602
01:01:57,948 --> 01:01:58,983
- I'd rather live
under the bridge

603
01:01:58,983 --> 01:02:00,885
than put up with
all these rules.

604
01:02:00,885 --> 01:02:03,587
You'|re starting to
sound like my mom.

605
01:02:05,355 --> 01:02:07,357
- Then go.

606
01:02:08,793 --> 01:02:10,594
Go.

607
01:02:15,299 --> 01:02:18,135
(gentle music)

608
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:20,938
You know, I think
you should go home.

609
01:02:20,938 --> 01:02:23,040
At least you have a mom that
can be worried sick about you.

610
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,542
- No, you're right, I'm sorry.

611
01:02:25,542 --> 01:02:27,077
I'|ll keep up with
my school stuff.

612
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:29,246
I want to stay.

613
01:02:30,647 --> 01:02:33,350
- Good.

614
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:34,819
Well, I'|m gonna
take Futt for a walk.

615
01:02:34,819 --> 01:02:36,186
You wanna come with?

616
01:02:36,186 --> 01:02:38,823
- Um no, I have
some things to do.

617
01:02:38,823 --> 01:02:42,126
- Okay, we'|ll meet
back here at five?

618
01:02:42,126 --> 01:02:45,662
- Okay.
(peaceful music)

619
01:03:02,412 --> 01:03:04,648
- This is beautiful.

620
01:03:04,648 --> 01:03:06,283
- It was my grandfather'|s.

621
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:08,886
He was stationed in
France in the great war.

622
01:03:09,987 --> 01:03:11,655
- Why are you selling it?

623
01:03:11,655 --> 01:03:14,124
- Honey, I| got too much stuff.

624
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:17,194
I don'|t have anybody
to leave it to.

625
01:03:19,429 --> 01:03:21,966
You live around here?

626
01:03:21,966 --> 01:03:23,467
- Yeah, right around the corner.

627
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:25,302
- I'|m Opal.

628
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:26,871
- I|'m Dior.

629
01:03:28,672 --> 01:03:29,974
Does it work?

630
01:03:29,974 --> 01:03:30,674
- Not any more.

631
01:03:30,674 --> 01:03:32,276
Used to.

632
01:03:32,276 --> 01:03:34,511
I haven'|t had the
time to get it fixed.

633
01:03:34,511 --> 01:03:36,947
- How much are you
selling it for?

634
01:03:36,947 --> 01:03:39,016
- Well, I was asking 25.

635
01:03:41,618 --> 01:03:42,352
You know what?

636
01:03:42,352 --> 01:03:43,353
Just take it.

637
01:03:43,353 --> 01:03:44,889
- I couldn'|t do that.

638
01:03:44,889 --> 01:03:48,893
- Okay then, one dollar.

639
01:03:48,893 --> 01:03:50,895
- Deal.

640
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:02,973
Stay right here, Futtman.

641
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:51,421
- Who|'s this?

642
01:04:57,261 --> 01:05:01,031
- I fixed it, Futtman!

643
01:05:04,034 --> 01:05:05,635
- Futtman?

644
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:08,472
Futtman?

645
01:05:09,673 --> 01:05:11,641
Futtman?

646
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,441
Hi, Emma.

647
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:19,609
Hi, what'|s goin' on?

648
01:06:19,609 --> 01:06:21,211
- I lost Futtman.

649
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:22,179
- You did?

650
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:23,347
Well let|'s go look for him.

651
01:06:23,347 --> 01:06:26,216
- I did, everywhere.

652
01:06:26,216 --> 01:06:28,518
- He'|ll show up.

653
01:06:28,518 --> 01:06:32,322
- I was busy fixing this
watch and I lost track of him.

654
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,825
- What'|s it worth?

655
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:38,428
- I|'m going to find out.

656
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:57,714
- So what|'s it worth?

657
01:06:57,714 --> 01:07:00,184
- Did you open it up?

658
01:07:00,184 --> 01:07:02,752
- Yeah, it had some
gears out of place.

659
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:06,123
- You fixed the
gears in this watch?

660
01:07:06,123 --> 01:07:07,657
Really?

661
01:07:07,657 --> 01:07:10,260
- She'|s really smart.

662
01:07:12,929 --> 01:07:15,432
- You scratched the bezel
getting the back off.

663
01:07:15,432 --> 01:07:17,467
It|'ll have to be replaced.

664
01:07:17,467 --> 01:07:19,703
So you repaired it?

665
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:21,338
- Yeah, what'|s the big deal?

666
01:07:21,338 --> 01:07:22,406
- You didn|'t steal it?

667
01:07:22,406 --> 01:07:25,809
- No, what'|s it worth?

668
01:07:29,846 --> 01:07:31,948
- I'|ll give you 15 for it.

669
01:07:31,948 --> 01:07:35,585
- 15, that'|s it?

670
01:07:39,156 --> 01:07:41,325
- Well, I can probably
buff the scratch out.

671
01:07:41,325 --> 01:07:44,161
I|'ll go 1,600.

672
01:07:47,764 --> 01:07:49,133
- Thanks, anyway.

673
01:07:49,133 --> 01:07:52,436
- All right 1,800 but
that'|s as high as I can go.

674
01:07:52,436 --> 01:07:54,171
- You and I both
know this is at least

675
01:07:54,171 --> 01:07:57,341
worth 4,500.

676
01:07:58,842 --> 01:08:01,145
- Look, I have to make a profit.

677
01:08:01,145 --> 01:08:04,481
- Yeah, but do you think
a 150% mark-up is fair?

678
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:08,152
This isn'|t just
some ordinary watch.

679
01:08:08,152 --> 01:08:10,654
This has historical
significance.

680
01:08:10,654 --> 01:08:14,358
An American soldier from
World War One purchased this.

681
01:08:14,358 --> 01:08:18,262
Who knows, it could have
belonged to General Pershing.

682
01:08:24,201 --> 01:08:27,704
- 2,500 that'|s as
high as I can go.

683
01:08:30,174 --> 01:08:32,276
- All right, you'|ve
got yourself a deal.

684
01:08:32,276 --> 01:08:35,679
(upbeat music)

685
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:39,783
- Wait just a second, girl.

686
01:08:39,783 --> 01:08:42,719
How did you find out how
much the watch was worth?

687
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:43,887
- I didn'|t.

688
01:08:43,887 --> 01:08:45,889
I would'|ve taken
20 bucks for it.

689
01:08:45,889 --> 01:08:48,392
- Then how did
you figure it out?

690
01:08:48,392 --> 01:08:52,296
- Well, I knew he wanted to
make a profit of about 200%.

691
01:08:52,296 --> 01:08:56,466
So I calculated the 1,500
and then added it to 200%.

692
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:58,535
- Which is what?

693
01:08:58,535 --> 01:09:00,904
- 4,500.

694
01:09:00,904 --> 01:09:02,806
It|'s simple math, Emma.

695
01:09:02,806 --> 01:09:06,610
- But what about all
that stuff about the war?

696
01:09:06,610 --> 01:09:08,812
- It|'s all in books.

697
01:09:08,812 --> 01:09:11,014
Let'|s go find Futtman.

698
01:09:14,684 --> 01:09:16,220
(door knocking)

699
01:09:19,523 --> 01:09:20,757
- Did you find it?

700
01:09:20,757 --> 01:09:24,661
- Yeah, I'|ve dealt
with this one before.

701
01:09:25,795 --> 01:09:29,266
Runaway, shoplifting, priors.

702
01:09:30,234 --> 01:09:31,501
Parents seem nice.

703
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:32,902
She just doesn'|t
like authority.

704
01:09:32,902 --> 01:09:34,471
- Hm.

705
01:09:34,471 --> 01:09:37,741
- I|'ve done this
three times with her.

706
01:09:37,741 --> 01:09:38,408
Is that her?

707
01:09:38,408 --> 01:09:39,409
- That|'s her.

708
01:09:39,409 --> 01:09:41,978
Saw her today at the park.

709
01:09:42,846 --> 01:09:45,515
- Doesn|'t surprise me.

710
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:47,351
Anything new on that
Strickland girl?

711
01:09:47,351 --> 01:09:50,053
- Yeah, I met with
her father at county.

712
01:09:50,053 --> 01:09:51,655
- Really?

713
01:09:51,655 --> 01:09:53,723
- He seems like a sweet guy.

714
01:09:53,723 --> 01:09:55,625
- I'|ll bet.

715
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:57,794
Bet he thinks he'|s
innocent, too.

716
01:09:57,794 --> 01:10:01,130
- Thing is, I don|'t think he
would do this to his daughter.

717
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:03,600
What, risk going to prison?

718
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,570
She|'s all he'|s got.

719
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:08,938
- Look, you'|ve gotta stop
trying to the save the world.

720
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:10,974
- I'|m not trying
to save the world.

721
01:10:10,974 --> 01:10:14,210
- You need to detach a
little bit from this case.

722
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:17,547
Some of us are going
out after work tonight.

723
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:18,482
Why don|'t you come with us?

724
01:10:18,482 --> 01:10:20,384
- Oh, don'|t do this to me, Ray.

725
01:10:20,384 --> 01:10:22,151
- Come on, get out of
your little apartment.

726
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:25,655
Have some fun.

727
01:10:25,655 --> 01:10:28,792
- If I say yes, will
you get out of my office

728
01:10:28,792 --> 01:10:30,427
so I can get some work done?

729
01:10:30,427 --> 01:10:31,361
- Yes.

730
01:10:31,361 --> 01:10:33,062
- Okay, I'|ll go.

731
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:35,499
Now get out of my office.

732
01:10:35,499 --> 01:10:37,334
Bye bye, Ray.

733
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:43,273
- Is this it?

734
01:10:44,341 --> 01:10:46,310
- Yeah.

735
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:48,412
I thought there was something
funny going on here.

736
01:10:48,412 --> 01:10:52,582
So I planted a security camera
in the break room last night.

737
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:53,917
- [Manager] Is that Terry?

738
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:55,819
- [Ben] Watch, he|'s
gonna put a tool

739
01:10:55,819 --> 01:10:59,623
in Mark'|s lunch box.

740
01:10:59,623 --> 01:11:00,724
- [Manager] So Mark
would get fired?

741
01:11:00,724 --> 01:11:02,225
- [Ben] Yes.

742
01:11:02,225 --> 01:11:03,560
- And Terry would get promoted.

743
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:06,029
- Uh huh.

744
01:11:06,963 --> 01:11:09,966
- Probably did the
same thing to Tim.

745
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:33,757
- You want some?

746
01:11:33,757 --> 01:11:35,625
- No, I|'m good.

747
01:11:39,529 --> 01:11:42,666
- What are you writing?

748
01:11:42,666 --> 01:11:45,234
- I'|m just asking
God to free my dad.

749
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:47,471
- You haven'|t
asked that before?

750
01:11:47,471 --> 01:11:49,138
- Well, normally I don'|t
question God|'s decisions,

751
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:52,576
but I|'ve had enough.

752
01:11:53,543 --> 01:11:55,779
I just want my dad back.

753
01:11:57,881 --> 01:11:59,148
(door knocking)

754
01:12:06,022 --> 01:12:07,657
- Sit, Terry.

755
01:12:13,563 --> 01:12:15,064
So, how are you
liking Tim|'s old job?

756
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:18,602
- It|'s good, pays more.

757
01:12:21,571 --> 01:12:23,407
- Did you hear about Mark?

758
01:12:23,407 --> 01:12:25,842
- No, what happened?

759
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:29,479
- We caught him stealing.

760
01:12:29,479 --> 01:12:31,981
- I never even trusted that guy.

761
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:35,552
- He never struck me
as the dishonest type.

762
01:12:35,552 --> 01:12:38,688
- Some guys will surprise you.

763
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:40,757
- We may have to let him go.

764
01:12:40,757 --> 01:12:44,728
- Well, he made his own bed.

765
01:12:44,728 --> 01:12:46,329
- It'|s unfortunate.

766
01:12:46,329 --> 01:12:49,999
Mark was a good
man, hard worker.

767
01:12:49,999 --> 01:12:52,736
A lot like Tim was.

768
01:12:54,438 --> 01:12:55,439
- Look, I gotta get going.

769
01:12:55,439 --> 01:12:57,507
It'|s getting kind of late.

770
01:12:57,507 --> 01:12:59,976
- [Manager] Sure,
one more thing.

771
01:13:08,151 --> 01:13:10,186
- When did you put a
camera in the break room?

772
01:13:10,186 --> 01:13:12,989
- Keep watching, it gets better.

773
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:21,798
I almost fired Mark
and promoted you.

774
01:13:22,766 --> 01:13:26,069
You wanna know the sad part
about this whole thing?

775
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:28,037
- You'|re firing me?

776
01:13:28,037 --> 01:13:31,174
- Besides that.

777
01:13:31,174 --> 01:13:34,478
Tim went to jail for
something you did!

778
01:13:39,616 --> 01:13:42,619
The police are in the other
office waiting for you.

779
01:13:42,619 --> 01:13:44,788
I just asked to
have a word with you

780
01:13:44,788 --> 01:13:46,890
before they took you away.

781
01:13:50,494 --> 01:13:52,896
(phone ringing)

782
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:57,066
- Hey Steven, what'|s up?

783
01:13:57,066 --> 01:13:59,102
- You are not
gonna believe this.

784
01:13:59,102 --> 01:14:01,404
- Oh, what|'s happened now?

785
01:14:01,404 --> 01:14:03,172
- Strickland didn'|t do it.

786
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:04,874
- What are you talking about?

787
01:14:04,874 --> 01:14:08,211
- Your guy was set up.

788
01:14:10,514 --> 01:14:11,515
Did you hear what I said?

789
01:14:11,515 --> 01:14:13,049
- I heard you.

790
01:14:15,318 --> 01:14:16,720
When are they releasing him?

791
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,021
- Tomorrow.

792
01:14:18,021 --> 01:14:19,422
- Does he know?

793
01:14:19,422 --> 01:14:20,890
- [Steven] Not yet.

794
01:14:22,526 --> 01:14:24,994
- I'|d like to be the one
to give him the good news.

795
01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:26,696
Can I do that, Steven, tonight?

796
01:14:26,696 --> 01:14:28,364
- Sure, if you want.

797
01:14:28,364 --> 01:14:30,567
- Tell them I|'ll be
there in 20 minutes, okay?

798
01:14:30,567 --> 01:14:32,836
- I'|ll let them
know you|'re coming.

799
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:51,187
- You can take the cuffs off.

800
01:14:51,187 --> 01:14:53,690
We won|'t be needing
them anymore.

801
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,635
- Tim, I have good news.

802
01:15:05,635 --> 01:15:06,736
- You found Dior?

803
01:15:06,736 --> 01:15:09,939
- No, but we will.

804
01:15:09,939 --> 01:15:11,875
You|'re being released.

805
01:15:11,875 --> 01:15:13,009
- What?

806
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:14,210
- One of your
co-workers admitted to

807
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:16,880
planting the tool
in your lunch box.

808
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,114
- So I can go?

809
01:15:18,114 --> 01:15:21,184
- Once the judge signs
the paperwork, yes.

810
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:24,588
Unfortunately, that
won'|t be until tomorrow.

811
01:15:28,658 --> 01:15:30,894
- Did they say who set me up?

812
01:15:30,894 --> 01:15:34,998
- Yeah, some guy named Terry.

813
01:15:34,998 --> 01:15:38,467
- He seemed like a decent guy.

814
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:41,705
- Anyway, one more
night and you'|re free.

815
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:45,609
- Um...

816
01:15:47,811 --> 01:15:49,445
do you think it'|s possible

817
01:15:49,445 --> 01:15:52,415
for you to come
pick me up tomorrow?

818
01:15:52,415 --> 01:15:55,685
- Yeah, of course.

819
01:15:55,685 --> 01:15:59,623
Once the judge releases
you I'|ll be here.

820
01:15:59,623 --> 01:16:00,389
- Thank you.

821
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:02,058
- You'|re welcome.

822
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:05,228
- Then go find my daughter.

823
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:09,065
- We|'ll find her
together, I promise.

824
01:16:17,674 --> 01:16:21,377
(ominous music)

825
01:17:29,512 --> 01:17:33,282
(majestic music)

826
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,051
- [Voiceover] Dear
Emma, I|'m sorry our

827
01:18:08,051 --> 01:18:10,353
friendship didn'|t work out.

828
01:18:10,353 --> 01:18:11,988
Take this money and go home

829
01:18:11,988 --> 01:18:13,589
and work things
out with your mom.

830
01:18:13,589 --> 01:18:15,224
Dior.

831
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:01,470
(phone ringing)

832
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:02,605
- Oh, Ray.

833
01:19:02,605 --> 01:19:04,607
I am so sorry I
forgot to call you.

834
01:19:04,607 --> 01:19:06,242
- I knew you weren'|t
going to show up.

835
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:08,978
- No no no, it'|s Strickland.

836
01:19:08,978 --> 01:19:10,814
They|'re releasing him.

837
01:19:10,814 --> 01:19:12,715
He'|s innocent.

838
01:19:12,715 --> 01:19:15,118
- Innocent?

839
01:19:15,118 --> 01:19:16,886
Wow.

840
01:19:16,886 --> 01:19:19,722
- I|'ve been down at county.

841
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:22,992
So maybe next time.

842
01:19:22,992 --> 01:19:24,627
- I get it.

843
01:19:24,627 --> 01:19:27,630
I|'m not your type.

844
01:19:31,868 --> 01:19:33,102
- Ray?

845
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:35,304
I don|t know what to say.

846
01:19:36,672 --> 01:19:39,175
- Okay, well um,

847
01:19:39,175 --> 01:19:41,845
have a good night.

848
01:19:41,845 --> 01:19:43,412
Hey, Ward?

849
01:19:43,412 --> 01:19:44,848
- Yeah?

850
01:19:44,848 --> 01:19:47,616
- I was wrong about what
I said earlier, all right?

851
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:49,318
Don'|t change.

852
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,222
Just stay the way you are.

853
01:19:53,222 --> 01:19:56,525
It'|s people like you that
make the world a better place.

854
01:19:58,694 --> 01:20:00,663
- Thanks, Ray.
(upbeat music)

855
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:06,302
(sighs)
(giggles)

856
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:35,965
(background TV)

857
01:21:00,223 --> 01:21:01,857
- Thank you for picking me up.

858
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:02,892
- You'|re welcome.

859
01:21:02,892 --> 01:21:04,193
- So where do we start?

860
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:06,762
- The park by your old house.

861
01:21:15,972 --> 01:21:19,142
- I|'m guessing you|'re
pretty mad at me?

862
01:21:21,244 --> 01:21:23,046
- I feel sorry for you.

863
01:21:23,046 --> 01:21:24,213
- Me?

864
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:25,814
- Yep.

865
01:21:25,814 --> 01:21:28,351
You have people
that care about you.

866
01:21:28,351 --> 01:21:29,352
But you run away.

867
01:21:29,352 --> 01:21:30,486
- You don|t understand.

868
01:21:30,486 --> 01:21:31,787
My mom doesn'|t care about me.

869
01:21:31,787 --> 01:21:33,957
She only cares about him.

870
01:21:33,957 --> 01:21:36,960
- It|'s probably nothing
like that at all.

871
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:39,128
Go home, Emma.

872
01:21:39,128 --> 01:21:40,964
Go home and grow up.

873
01:21:40,964 --> 01:21:44,233
- I came here to apologize and
you'|re acting like a jerk.

874
01:21:45,601 --> 01:21:47,136
- Run away.

875
01:21:47,136 --> 01:21:49,272
Isn'|t that what you do when
you don|'t like what you hear?

876
01:21:49,272 --> 01:21:50,373
- I saw your dog.

877
01:21:50,373 --> 01:21:51,407
- Where?

878
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:53,676
- I|'m not going to tell you.

879
01:21:53,676 --> 01:21:56,245
Oh, and by the way,
I'|m calling the police,

880
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:57,846
and I|'m letting them know
you|'re living in that

881
01:21:57,846 --> 01:22:00,349
stupid storage place.

882
01:22:03,686 --> 01:22:07,123
- So this is where
you saw her last?

883
01:22:07,123 --> 01:22:09,025
- Yeah.

884
01:22:12,996 --> 01:22:14,363
- That'|s her dog!

885
01:22:14,363 --> 01:22:15,898
- She has a dog?

886
01:22:41,390 --> 01:22:44,127
- This is her dog.

887
01:22:44,127 --> 01:22:46,795
She'|s gotta be
around here somewhere.

888
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:50,033
- Futt!

889
01:22:50,033 --> 01:22:53,469
(emotional music)

890
01:22:56,472 --> 01:22:58,541
Dad?

891
01:23:09,618 --> 01:23:11,054
I thought you were in jail?

892
01:23:11,054 --> 01:23:13,256
- They caught the
guy that did it.

893
01:23:13,256 --> 01:23:15,858
- I knew you didn'|t do it, dad.

894
01:23:19,628 --> 01:23:21,497
- Where have you been living?

895
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:23,066
- In our storage unit.

896
01:23:23,066 --> 01:23:25,268
- You|'re kidding?

897
01:23:26,602 --> 01:23:29,072
- And Futtman'|s okay, too.

898
01:23:33,776 --> 01:23:36,079
- Thank you.

899
01:23:36,079 --> 01:23:38,147
- You|'re welcome.

900
01:23:44,653 --> 01:23:45,654
- Thank you.

901
01:23:45,654 --> 01:23:47,156
- You|'re welcome. (giggles)

902
01:23:56,832 --> 01:23:58,934
- You bought a broken
watch for a dollar,

903
01:23:58,934 --> 01:24:01,937
fixed it, and sold it for 2,500?

904
01:24:03,239 --> 01:24:05,941
- So now we can go home.

905
01:24:10,613 --> 01:24:12,281
- That|'s your money.

906
01:24:12,281 --> 01:24:13,716
You earned it.

907
01:24:13,716 --> 01:24:16,852
- Dad, I only earned it because
of what you|'ve taught me.

908
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:25,261
- Well, it would be nice
to leave these motels.

909
01:24:25,261 --> 01:24:26,629
- And you snore.

910
01:24:26,629 --> 01:24:27,730
- No!

911
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:30,299
- Yeah, like a lot! (giggles)

912
01:24:31,367 --> 01:24:33,602
(phone ringing)

913
01:24:33,602 --> 01:24:36,339
- Who the heck could that be?

914
01:24:38,241 --> 01:24:40,042
Hello?

915
01:24:40,042 --> 01:24:40,976
Hi.

916
01:24:40,976 --> 01:24:42,978
- Don'|t eat that on the bed.

917
01:24:42,978 --> 01:24:44,513
- Okay.

918
01:24:47,015 --> 01:24:48,384
Right.

919
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,722
I|'ll see you tomorrow then.

920
01:24:57,493 --> 01:24:58,427
- Who was that?

921
01:24:58,427 --> 01:25:00,529
- My boss.

922
01:25:00,529 --> 01:25:03,632
I got my job back.

923
01:25:03,632 --> 01:25:05,701
- That|'s awesome!

924
01:25:05,701 --> 01:25:08,171
- It'|s like it never happened.

925
01:25:10,339 --> 01:25:12,975
We got our life back.

926
01:25:14,177 --> 01:25:17,613
(background TV)

927
01:25:27,656 --> 01:25:28,957
Chinese?

928
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:31,394
- Sure.

929
01:25:31,394 --> 01:25:33,696
You wanna invite Ms. Ward?

930
01:25:33,696 --> 01:25:36,399
- What?

931
01:25:36,399 --> 01:25:38,267
Why?

932
01:25:38,267 --> 01:25:39,802
- Come on, dad.

933
01:25:39,802 --> 01:25:42,738
I saw the way you two were
looking at each other.

934
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:47,310
She'|s a very nice person, dad.

935
01:25:48,344 --> 01:25:51,046
- I hardly know her.

936
01:25:51,046 --> 01:25:53,716
- Well then call her and
invite her to dinner.

937
01:25:54,883 --> 01:25:57,019
- You'|re serious?

938
01:25:57,019 --> 01:25:58,721
- I think it'll be good.

939
01:25:58,721 --> 01:26:00,523
For all of us.

940
01:26:08,297 --> 01:26:10,233
- I can'|t call her.

941
01:26:22,745 --> 01:26:26,249
(phone ringing)

942
01:26:29,318 --> 01:26:30,253
- Hello?

943
01:26:30,253 --> 01:26:31,987
- Hi, this is Dior.

944
01:26:31,987 --> 01:26:33,522
My dad was wondering if
you'd like to have dinner

945
01:26:33,522 --> 01:26:34,990
with us tonight.

946
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:36,158
- Tonight?

947
01:26:36,158 --> 01:26:38,494
- Yeah, tonight.

948
01:26:38,494 --> 01:26:39,762
She likes you.

949
01:26:39,762 --> 01:26:40,796
- What did she say?

950
01:26:40,796 --> 01:26:42,365
- Hello?

951
01:26:44,633 --> 01:26:46,134
- Oh, my.

952
01:26:46,134 --> 01:26:48,271
- Hello?

953
01:26:48,271 --> 01:26:50,773
- Sure, yes, um --

954
01:26:50,773 --> 01:26:53,008
- Hold on one sec.

955
01:26:54,277 --> 01:26:55,378
- Seriously, dad?

956
01:26:55,378 --> 01:26:57,045
- When, I mean, where?

957
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:59,014
- I don|t have
any clothes, Dior!

958
01:26:59,014 --> 01:27:01,750
- My dad doesn|t
have any clothes.

959
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:04,186
Well, you'|re not helping here!

960
01:27:04,186 --> 01:27:06,121
Sorry, never mind.

961
01:27:06,121 --> 01:27:08,324
Just come to the
motel in one hour

962
01:27:08,324 --> 01:27:10,158
and we|'ll order Chinese food.

963
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:11,193
- One hour.

964
01:27:11,193 --> 01:27:12,728
- Bye.

965
01:27:13,829 --> 01:27:17,300
- I|'d better go get some food.

966
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:20,002
- You should get
some flowers, too.

967
01:27:20,002 --> 01:27:21,737
- You think so?

968
01:27:21,737 --> 01:27:23,105
- Yeah.

969
01:27:23,105 --> 01:27:26,108
- Okay, okay.

970
01:27:38,854 --> 01:27:40,222
- Okay.

971
01:27:41,324 --> 01:27:42,825
(door knocking)

972
01:27:43,892 --> 01:27:45,093
- She|'s here.

973
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:46,995
- Wait, wait.

974
01:27:49,898 --> 01:27:51,700
- You look fine.

975
01:27:52,901 --> 01:27:54,403
- Okay.

976
01:27:55,471 --> 01:27:56,439
- Ms. Ward?

977
01:27:56,439 --> 01:27:58,073
- [Ms. Ward] Hi.
- [Dior] Hi.

978
01:27:59,074 --> 01:28:02,077
- Oh, (laughing) sorry.

979
01:28:04,847 --> 01:28:05,948
- Would you like to have a seat?

980
01:28:05,948 --> 01:28:07,182
- Of course, thank you.

981
01:28:07,182 --> 01:28:09,352
- Oh, let me get that.

982
01:28:14,222 --> 01:28:15,257
- I hope you like Chinese.

983
01:28:15,257 --> 01:28:16,759
- I do, I love it.

984
01:28:16,759 --> 01:28:18,994
Looks great, guys.

985
01:28:23,999 --> 01:28:28,637
- God is great, God is good,
let us thank him, for our food.

986
01:28:28,637 --> 01:28:32,541
By his hand, we are fed, give
us, Lord, our daily bread.

987
01:28:33,642 --> 01:28:37,846
P.S. thanks for
answering all my letters.

988
01:28:37,846 --> 01:28:40,483
And for bringing us
all together tonight.

989
01:28:40,483 --> 01:28:41,684
Amen.

990
01:28:41,684 --> 01:28:43,018
- Amen.

991
01:28:43,018 --> 01:28:44,687
- [Ms. Ward] Amen.

992
01:28:54,697 --> 01:28:58,901
(upbeat music)
