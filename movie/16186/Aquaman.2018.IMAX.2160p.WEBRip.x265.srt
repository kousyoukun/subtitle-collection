法国科幻作家  著有《海底两万里》

9
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,320
"把两艘船放在
"Put two ships in the open sea

10
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,660
风平浪静的大海上  它们必会相遇"
without wind or tide, they will come together."

11
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,620
我的父母就是这样相遇的
That's how my parents met.

12
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,420
就像两艘命中注定会相遇的船
Like two ships destined for each other.

13
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,500
没事了
It's okay.

14
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:08,540
别紧张  你刚才都没气了
Easy. You weren't breathing.

15
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,490
他们来自两个不同的世界
They were from different worlds.

16
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,960
但人生就如大海
But life, like the sea,

17
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,440
让他们走到了一起
has a way of bringing people together.

18
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,820
我正打算给你煎鸡蛋
I was gonna make you some eggs.

19
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,580
别把我的狗吃了  好吗
Just don't eat my dog, okay?

20
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,520
没事的
It's okay.

21
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,060
我给你泡了茶
I made tea.

22
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,530
来  喝一口
Go on, try it.

23
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,800
喝了会感觉好些
It'll make you better.

24
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,860
那么  你是谁
So, uh, who are you?

25
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,630
亚特兰娜
Atlanna.

26
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,130
亚特兰蒂斯女王
Queen of Atlantis.

27
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:16,740
我叫汤姆  灯塔看守人
I'm Tom. Keeper of lighthouse.

28
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,940
她从一场包办婚姻中逃离
She had fled an arranged marriage.

29
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,970
抛下了她的世界
Left her whole world behind.

30
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,180
但在我父亲的灯塔里
But in my father's lighthouse,

31
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,650
她找寻到了意想不到的东西
she found something unexpected.

32
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,250
而我父亲找到了他的一生挚爱
And my father found the love of his life.

33
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,960
四级飓风亚瑟
Category 4 Hurricane Arthur

34
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,360
将在下午两点后登陆
is due to make landfall sometime after 2:00 P.M.

35
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,700
叫亚瑟怎么样
How about Arthur?

36
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,770
飓风的名字吗
After the hurricane?

37
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,470
是传奇亚瑟王的名字  他也是个王  不是吗
After a legend. He's a king, isn't he?

38
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,270
他还不止如此
He's more than that.

39
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,940
他是我们两族能和平共处的证明
He's living proof our people can coexist.

40
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,810
总有一天他会让我们的世界团结起来
He could unite our worlds one day.

41
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,550
只有最强大的亚特兰蒂斯人
And the trident could only be wielded

42
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,990
才能使用三叉戟
by the strongest Atlantean.

43
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:48,330
亚特兰王凭借它掌控了七大海洋
And it gave King Atlan mastery over the seven seas.

44
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,540
三叉戟使他变得如此强大  以至于海洋都嫉妒他
It made him so powerful that the ocean itself became jealous

45
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,010
发动了一场可怕的地震来摧毁亚特兰蒂斯
and sent a terrible earthquake to destroy Atlantis.

46
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,410
亚特兰蒂斯陨落了  沉入了海底
Down it fell, to the bottom of the ocean.

47
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:04,010
但是  传说有一天会有一个新的国王到来
But, legend has it that one day a new king will come

48
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,350
他将使用三叉戟的力量
who will use the power of the trident

49
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,580
将亚特兰蒂斯重新联合起来
to put Atlantis back together again.

50
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,660
抱着他
Take him!

51
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,310
亚特兰娜女王
Queen Atlanna,

52
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,450
欧瓦克国王命令您
by the authority of King Orvax,

53
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,550
立刻返回亚特兰蒂斯
you are ordered to return to Atlantis.

54
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,820
亚特兰娜
Atlanna!

55
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,890
但亚特兰蒂斯从不忘却
But Atlantis' memory is long...

56
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:53,530
国王不愿放她走
And its king refused to let her go.

57
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,380
-亚特兰娜  -汤姆
- Atlanna! - Tom!

58
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,280
-我的武器  -接住
- My weapon! - Here!

59
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,670
他们的两个世界本就不该相遇
Their two worlds were never meant to meet,

60
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,080
而我是一段本不该相爱的爱情的产物
and I was a product of a love that never should've been.

61
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,050
你不必回去的  亚特兰娜  求你
You don't have to do this, Atlanna. Please.

62
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:49,180
不  他们总能找到我
No. They will always find me.

63
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,950
下一次  他们会派出一支大军
Next time, they'll send an army.

64
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:57,460
我必须回去  只有这样才能救他
I have to go back. It is the only way to save him.

65
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,470
救你
Save you.

66
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,070
在我的世界里
Where I come from...

67
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,710
大海会带走我们的泪
The sea carries our tears away.

68
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,250
在这里不会
Not here.

69
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,250
在这里你能感受到泪
Here you feel them.

70
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,460
等安全了  我就回来找你们
I will return to you. When it's safe.

71
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,460
有朝一日
One day.

72
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,400
就在这里  日出之时
Right here, at sunrise.

73
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,900
我们会再团聚
We'll be together again.

74
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,640
你要坚强  我的小王子
You stay strong, my little prince.

75
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,840
我永远和你在一起
I'll always be with you.

76
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,320
别让他忘了我  好吗
Don't let him forget me. Hmm?

77
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,750
所有的生命都从海中孕育
All life came from the sea,

78
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,020
所以我们想要了解自己
so if we want to understand ourselves,

79
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,990
就必须回到起点来看一看
we must journey to where we began.

80
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:36,770
马萨诸塞州  波士顿海洋馆

81
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,770
而现在  比起我们地球的海底
Now, today, we have better maps of Mars

82
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,860
我们更了解的是火星的地貌
than we do of our own sea floor.

83
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,990
过来  靠近点  快  小鱼鱼
Come on, closer. Come on, fishy.

84
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,460
-快  快过来  -小伙子们
- Come on. Come over here. - Boys!

85
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,730
-别拍了  -快过来
- Stop that. - Come on.

86
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,900
跟着大家一起走
Come along.

87
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,840
-再见  小鱼  -再见
- Bye, fishy. - Bye.

88
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,970
我叫亚瑟  你们叫什么
My name's Arthur. What's yours?

89
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,180
-你们饿了吗  我也饿了  -瞧啊
- You guys hungry? Me, too. - Check it out.

90
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,710
亚瑟在跟鱼讲话
Arthur is talking to the fish.

91
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,410
怪胎一个  亚瑟
Such a freak, Arthur.

92
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,050
-住手  -那你要怎么办呢  怪胎
- Stop! - What are you gonna do about it, freak?

93
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,220
住手  别碰我
Stop it! Don't!

94
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,420
放开我
Let me go!

95
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:06,420
海王

96
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,420
时至今日

97
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,200
你是谁
Who are you?

98
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,910
走  快走
Come on, let's go. Move it.

99
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,080
快走  快点
Come on. Hurry up.

100
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,890
头儿  我们控制了船长
Sir, we've secured the Captain.

101
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,750
求救信号关掉了
Distress signal's disabled.

102
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,390
没人找得到我们
We're running dark again.

103
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,790
但他们已经知道了  你们逃不掉了
But they heard it. You can count on it.

104
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:30,430
我跟你做个交易  我不教你怎么当船长
I'll make you a deal. I won't tell you how to Captain...

105
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,630
你也别教我怎么当海盗
And you don't tell me how to pirate.

106
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,380
其他船员在哪里
Where's the rest of the crew?

107
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,210
他们的勇气只有不做无谓的冒险
Decided discretion was the better part of valor

108
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,310
并把自己锁在鱼雷舱里
and sealed themselves up in the torpedo bay.

109
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,020
我们名声在外啊
Our reputation precedes us.

110
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,680
是你名声在外
Your reputation.

111
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,120
这是你的胜利
This is your win.

112
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,330
给
Here.

113
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,100
我可不能收
Can't take that piece of junk.

114
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,530
这是你的挚爱
It's the love of your life.

115
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,370
我从没告诉过你它背后的故事
I never told you the story behind it.

116
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,810
这是你爷爷传给我的
This was your grandfather's.

117
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:16,580
他是第二次世界大战期间海军的第一批蛙人
He was one of the Navy's first frogmen during World War II.

118
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,270
他非常擅长在水中隐蔽
He was so stealthy in the water,

119
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:22,310
部队里给他起了绰号叫魔鬼鱼
his unit nicknamed him Manta.

120
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,080
可是战后  他的国家把他忘了
But after the war, his country forgot about him.

121
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,970
于是他回到了海里
So, he went back to the sea,

122
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,660
用他的智慧糊口求生
scavenging and surviving with his wit...

123
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,220
他带着这把刀
And this knife.

124
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,260
我像你这么大的时候  他把刀传给了我
He gave it to me when I was your age.

125
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,770
现在它是你的了  儿子
And now it's yours, son.

126
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,530
我们撞到什么了吗
Did we just hit something?

127
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:15,200
不  是有东西撞了我们
No. Something hit us.

128
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,700
头儿  外面有东西
Sir, there's something out there.

129
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,900
又来了一艘潜水艇吗
Another submarine?

130
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,540
不  我觉得是个人
Uh... No. I think it's a man.

131
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,490
不可能是人
That's not a man.

132
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:17,560
A队  去右边  B队  检查通道
Alpha, to the right. Bravo team, sweep the passageway.

133
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,520
我可以进来吗
Permission to come aboard?

134
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,310
海王
Aquaman!

135
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:16,660
动作快点

136
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,310
我为了救你们可错过了不少欢乐时光

137
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,780
我等你很久了
I've waited a long time for this.

138
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,020
我应该认识你吗
Am I supposed to know who you are?

139
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,430
我在公海上寻找猎物
I scavenge the high seas.

140
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,660
你是海王
You're the Aquaman.

141
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,930
我们注定会相见
We were bound to meet at some point.

142
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,370
就不要经常见了吧
Let's not make it a habit.

143
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,970
起来
Up.

144
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,110
爸爸
Dad!

145
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,940
爸爸
Dad?

146
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,050
真不要脸
Shame on you.

147
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,720
你们自找的麻烦
Boys got yourselves into this mess.

148
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,990
就自己出去吧
Get yourselves out of it.

149
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,000
混蛋
Bastard!

150
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,810
爸爸
Dad!

151
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,180
爸爸
Dad!

152
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,580
等等
Wait!

153
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,420
帮帮我  他被压住了
Help me! He's trapped!

154
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,190
你不能就这么丢下他
You can't leave him like this!

155
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,420
求你了
Please!

156
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:19,500
你杀了无辜的人  向大海乞求怜悯去吧
You killed innocent people. You ask the sea for mercy.

157
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,610
压载舱破裂

158
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,410
快走  别管我
Get outta here! I got this!

159
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,080
闭嘴  我不会丢下你
Shut up, I'm not leaving you!

160
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,050
你必须活下去  才能杀了那个混蛋
You need to live, so you can kill that son of a bitch!

161
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,650
-快走  -不
- Now, go! - No!

162
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,220
-走啊  -闭嘴
- Go! - Shut up!

163
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,060
不
No!

164
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,730
不
No!

165
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,190
该死的
Damn you!

166
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,750
走吧
Go.

167
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,760
我总是知道在哪里能找到你
I always know where to find you.

168
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,970
老习惯了
Old habits.

169
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,640
-来吧  我请你吃早餐  -好咧
- Come on, I'll buy you breakfast. - All right!

170
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,950
你要我让他们帮你把酒装到吸管杯里吗
You want me to have them put that in a sippy cup for you?

171
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,790
为什么我能在水下呼吸
How is it that I can breathe underwater,

172
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:03,190
在酒桌上却还是喝不过你
but you can still drink me under the table?

173
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:06,030
这是我的超能力
That's my superpower.

174
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,630
一艘俄罗斯潜艇
A Russian submarine

175
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,860
昨晚被高科技海盗劫持
hijacked late last night by high-tech pirates.

176
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:12,000
这些海盗涉嫌
The same pirates who are suspected

177
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,840
与海军高度机密的
in connection with the disappearance of the Navy's

178
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,370
隐形潜艇原型的失踪有关
highly classified prototype stealth submarine.

179
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:20,710
现有未经证实的报道称
And a further development, we now have unconfirmed reports

180
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,450
是这位被社交媒体戏称为"海王"的超能力者
that the metahuman dubbed by social media as "the Aquaman"

181
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,320
进行了此次大胆的营救行动
was responsible for this daring rescue.

182
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,750
不是我
That's not me.

183
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:32,920
胡说八道  就是你  对吗 
Bullshit. You're doing it, aren't you? Huh?

184
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,190
就像维科教导你的那样
What Vulko trained you to do.

185
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:39,430
我就知道你不可能永远袖手旁观
I knew you couldn't stand on the sidelines forever.

186
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,530
你妈妈一直都知道你很特别
Your mother always knew you were special.

187
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:43,100
别说了
Don't even start.

188
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,170
她相信你能让我们的两个世界团结起来
She believed you'd be the one to unite our two worlds.

189
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,340
别说了
Just stop.

190
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,510
不管亚特兰蒂斯有什么问题  你都会不在话下
Whatever Atlantis' problems are, you're bigger than them.

191
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,540
亚特兰蒂斯害死了我妈妈
Atlantis murdered my mother.

192
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,040
你不能肯定
You don't know that for sure.

193
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,410
我肯定
Yes, I do.

194
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:03,220
他们杀了她  因为她爱你  因为她生下了我
They killed her. For loving you and having me.

195
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,420
你心里明白
And you know it.

196
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:13,660
儿子  总有一天你不能再怪罪你自己了
Son, one day you're gonna have to stop blaming yourself.

197
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,100
兄弟
Hey, buddy.

198
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,940
你是电视上那个鱼人吗
You that fish boy from the TV?

199
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,310
好极了
Oh, great.

200
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,980
我是鱼人  有何贵干
It's "Fish man." What do you want?

201
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,990
我告诉你我想干什么
I'll tell you what I want.

202
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,360
可以和你合影吗
Could we get a picture with you?

203
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,290
你是我们这儿的英雄  兄弟
You're like our local hero, man.

204
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,930
拜托你了  拍一张要不了多久
It would mean a lot. Just a quick...

205
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,840
随便你吧
Whatever.

206
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,440
-好  来拍吧  -别碰我
- All right. Let's do this. - Don't touch me.

207
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,740
好  很好  我们这样拍
Right, that's exactly right. I'm gonna go down here.

208
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,340
来了  大家笑一个
There we go. Everybody smile.

209
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:24,740
大西洋某处

210
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,730
他明白这次会面的重要性
He understands the significance of this meeting.

211
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,700
他会听你说的
He'll hear you out.

212
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,060
-奥姆王  -涅柔斯国王
- King Orm. - King Nereus.

213
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,430
你挑的会面地点
You picked a meeting place

214
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,490
太接近陆地了  我不喜欢
too close to the surface for my liking.

215
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:29,330
你不知道这里是国王议会吗
You don't recognize the Council of the Kings?

216
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,730
亚特兰国王在位之时  七大王国是一体的
In Atlan's time, when the Seven Kingdoms were one,

217
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:35,430
我们的祖先会聚集在这里
our ancestors gathered here.

218
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,140
亚特兰蒂斯国王坐在桌首
Atlantis sat here at the head of the table.

219
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,840
泽贝尔国王  像往常一样  坐在他旁边
Xebel, as always, by his side.

220
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,710
咸水族  鱼人族
Brine. Fishermen.

221
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,940
那时候迷失国和海沟族还没有陨落
The Deserters and the Trench had not yet fallen.

222
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,050
失落国度还没有消亡
The Lost Nation had not yet vanished.

223
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:52,020
他们一起造就了世界上最伟大的帝国
Together, they were the greatest empire the world had ever seen.

224
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,020
但是现在  我坐在亚特兰的宝座上
But now, I sit on Atlan's throne,

225
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,720
被陈旧的法律和政治束缚着
shackled by archaic laws and politics.

226
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,890
而我们头顶上威胁的增长却不可忽视...
While the threat above us grows undeniably...

227
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:01,200
陆地人总是充斥着暴力
Violence has always plagued the surface.

228
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,430
他们会毁了自己
They will destroy themselves.

229
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,270
他们会先毁了我们
Not before destroying us first.

230
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:09,540
我们已经躲藏得够久了
We have been hiding long enough.

231
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:13,340
亚特兰蒂斯再次崛起的时刻已经到来
The time has come for Atlantis to rise again.

232
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,510
我们尊敬你  涅柔斯国王
We honor you, King Nereus,

233
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:20,310
我们邀请泽贝尔成为第一个
by inviting Xebel to be the first kingdom

234
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,610
加入奥姆王联盟的王国
to join King Orm's alliance.

235
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,450
说得好像还有别的选择一样  维科
As if you had a choice, Vulko.

236
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:26,620
根据法律  你必须征得四个王国的同意
By law, you need four of the Seven Kingdoms

237
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,290
才能掌权并发动攻击
to ascend and attack.

238
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:30,490
失落国度和迷失国早已灭亡
The Lost Nation and the Deserters have long perished.

239
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,560
海沟族只剩下怪兽
The Trench are nothing but animals.

240
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,190
咸水族永远不可能加入  而鱼人族都是懦夫
The Brine will never join you, and the Fishermen are cowards.

241
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,360
没有我和我的军队去说服他们
Without me and my army to convince them,

242
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,330
你的计划就会胎死腹中
your plans are stillborn.

243
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,700
但我知道你真正的目的
But I know what you really want.

244
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,570
一旦你得到了四个王国的首肯
Once you've obtained the pledge of the four kingdoms,

245
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,240
你就会成为
you will be ordained

246
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,640
海洋领主
Ocean Master.

247
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,110
那不过是一个头衔
That is merely a title.

248
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,110
我不是傻子  奥姆王
I'm no fool, King Orm.

249
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,580
成为海洋领主  你就能指挥
As Ocean Master, you'll be commander

250
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,380
这个星球上最强大的军事力量
of the greatest military might on this planet.

251
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,390
我是天选的领导者
I am the natural choice to lead it.

252
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,620
是吗
Are you?

253
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:08,260
有传言说还有一位天选之子
What about the rumors that there's another?

254
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:11,860
一个亚特兰蒂斯人  生活在陆地上
An Atlantean, living among the surface.

255
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:14,330
他也是皇室的血脉
One of royal blood.

256
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,550
你可以坐在亚特兰蒂斯的王座上
You may sit on the throne of Atlantis,

257
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,240
但你王座摇摇欲坠
but your claim to it is weak.

258
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,370
你怎么可能还想着要统一整个帝国呢
How can you possibly hope to unite the empire?

259
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,710
我母亲的野种甚至没来过亚特兰蒂斯
My mother's bastard has never even been to Atlantis.

260
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,940
他忠于陆地
His loyalty is to the surface.

261
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,160
是陆地人  拿起武器
Surface-dwellers! To arms!

262
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,210
你们的国王受伤了
Your king is injured!

263
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,040
我不是想发动战争
I'm not trying to start a war.

264
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,510
战争早就已经开始了
The war has already begun.

265
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:08,110
是时候让他们听听们要说的话了
Then it's time we send them a message they'll hear.

266
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,820
-我没事  -别走
- I'm good. - Stop.

267
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,620
-给你钥匙  -谢谢
- Here're the keys. - Thank you.

268
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,020
我们回家给你纹面吧
Let's go home and work on your ta moko. Huh?

269
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,520
要是你祖父还活着
If your grandpops was still alive,

270
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,590
看见你没做完纹面  肯定会狠狠打我们的头
he'd be banging our heads for not finishing it.

271
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,360
是的  但我们有的是时间
Yes, he would, but there is plenty of time for that.

272
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:29,070
先送你回去睡觉
We gotta get you to bed.

273
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,570
明白吗
Got it?

274
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,840
我一直在找你
I've been looking for you.

275
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,180
不不不
Oh, no, no, no...

276
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,550
我需要你跟我回亚特兰蒂斯
I need you to come with me to Atlantis.

277
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,380
我要告诉你的话
Listen, I'm gonna tell you the same thing

278
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,380
我已经跟那老海星维科说过了
that I told that rusty starfish Vulko.

279
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,420
不过对你客气点  因为尊重女士
Except nicer, because you're a lady.

280
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,420
不  谢谢  我没兴趣
No, thank you. I'm not interested.

281
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:54,590
你打败了荒原狼  拯救了亚特兰蒂斯
You defeated Steppenwolf and saved Atlantis.

282
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,460
那跟亚特兰蒂斯一点关系都没有
That had nothing to do with Atlantis.

283
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,950
你同母异父的兄弟奥姆王
Your half-brother King Orm is about to

284
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,100
就要发动对陆地世界的战争了
declare war upon the surface world.

285
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,030
数十亿的人将会丧生
Billions will die.

286
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,470
你我的族群都是
Your people and mine.

287
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,170
我们必须阻止他
We must stop him.

288
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,610
那你建议我们怎么做
And how do you propose we do that?

289
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:16,080
你是亚特兰娜女王的长子
You are the firstborn son of Queen Atlanna.

290
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,380
王位是你与生俱来的权利
The throne is yours by birthright.

291
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:23,890
阻止这场战争  拯救两个世界的唯一方法
The only way to stop this war and save both worlds

292
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:27,460
就是让你获得你应有的国王地位
is for you to take your rightful place as king.

293
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,300
你觉得只要我一出现  奥姆就会放弃王位吗
You think if I just show up, Orm's gonna give up the throne?

294
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,870
我是被你们处决的女王的私生子
I'm the bastard son of the queen your people executed.

295
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:39,500
相信我  我不是什么国王
Trust me. I am no king.

296
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,370
我同意
I agree.

297
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:42,770
那太好了  很好
That's awesome. Cool.

298
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:45,740
但是  不知为何维科很信任你
But, Vulko seems to believe in you for some reason,

299
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,380
所以我来了
and that's why I'm here.

300
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,280
维科已经找到了亚特兰失落三叉戟的位置
Vulko has learned of the location of the Lost Trident of Atlan.

301
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,350
童话故事  那只是个传说
Ooh, fairy tales. It's a myth.

302
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,880
不是传说
It's not a myth.

303
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,990
有了神圣的三叉戟  人们就会服从你
With the Sacred Trident, the people will listen to you.

304
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:59,290
你就可以获得你与生俱来的权利  废黜奥姆
You can then claim your birthright and dethrone Orm.

305
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:03,160
我与生俱来的权利已经和我母亲一同死去了
My birthright? It died with my mother.

306
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,560
但我可以向你保证  要是奥姆发动攻击
But I promise you this. If Orm attacks,

307
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,730
我会用你们对待我母亲的方式对待他
I will treat him exactly the same way your people treated her.

308
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,500
毫不留情
With no mercy.

309
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:40,100
北海某处

310
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,560
那艘潜艇几乎已经废了  但它完成了它的使命
That submarine was barely operational, but it served its purpose.

311
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:17,330
你的一个族人阻碍了我
One of your kind intervened.

312
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,400
他不是我们的一员
He is not one of us.

313
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,310
他杀了我父亲
He killed my father.

314
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,540
我们的交易已经结束了
Our transaction has ended.

315
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:32,650
我不要钱  我要海王
Keep the money. I want Aquaman.

316
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,820
爸爸
Dad!

317
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,290
爸爸
Dad!

318
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,760
爸爸
Dad!

319
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,560
爸爸
Pops!

320
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,560
爸爸
Pops!

321
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,640
起来  爸爸
Come on, Pops.

322
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,170
快  他没有呼吸了
Come on! He's not breathing.

323
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,470
让开  我来
Move! Let me help.

324
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,380
醒醒  爸爸
Come on, Pops.

325
00:35:58,930 --> 00:35:59,930
醒一醒
Come on.

326
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:16,710
我还不知道你的名字
I don't even know your name.

327
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,480
我是泽贝尔公主媚拉·查拉
It's Princess Y'Mera Xebella Challa.

328
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,480
你可以叫我媚拉
You may call me Mera.

329
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,790
谢谢你  媚拉
Thank you, Mera.

330
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,410
天哪
Dear God.

331
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,750
是奥姆干的
This was Orm's doing.

332
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,450
最坏的还没来
The worst is yet to come.

333
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,890
已经设立了暴洪预警
There's a flash flood warning here

334
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,590
时间延长了几小时
that was just extended for a couple hours.

335
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,200
今天在世界各地出现了前所未有的景象
Unprecedented sights from all over the world today.

336
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,870
我们看到战舰和垃圾被巨浪冲上岸
We are seeing warships and trash washed up by massive waves.

337
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:16,200
海岸线上充斥着废物和垃圾
These extraordinary scenes of coastlines deluged with waste

338
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,710
这不同寻常的场景正在世界各地上演
and garbage are taking place all over the world.

339
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:21,980
几十年间产生的污染又重新回到了陆地上
Decades of pollution has been thrown back onto land.

340
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,810
许多人都在问这样一个问题
Many are asking the question,

341
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,180
这是自然灾害还是另有缘由
"Was this a natural disaster or something else?"

342
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,780
不  这不是自然灾害
No. This was no natural disaster.

343
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,120
是他们把我们的垃圾和战舰扔了出来
They threw out our garbage and our warships.

344
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,520
这是我们与亚特兰蒂斯人民的首次接触
This was our first contact with the people of Atlantis.

345
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,820
你又开始讲你那疯疯癫癫的亚特兰蒂斯理论了
There you go again with your insane Atlantean theory.

346
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,720
你完全没有任何证据  沈博士
You have absolutely no proof, Dr. Shin.

347
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,160
睁开眼睛看看
Open your eyes.

348
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,730
已经有一个亚特兰蒂斯人生活在我们中间
We already have an Atlantean living among us,

349
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,460
他的名字叫海王
and his name is Aquaman.

350
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,770
这是哪里
What is it?

351
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,170
维科就是在这里
This is the exact spot

352
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,980
给我上了第一堂游泳课
that Vulko gave me my first swimming lesson.

353
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:59,310
你必须把陆地上学到的一切忘掉
You have to forget all the teaching of the surface world

354
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:04,080
更深入地挖掘你亚特兰蒂斯人的本能
and go deeper to uncover your Atlantean instincts.

355
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:06,350
可我已经知道怎么游泳了
But I already know how to swim.

356
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,090
还远远不够
Not even close.

357
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,590
我们先说清楚
Just so we're clear,

358
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,630
我会帮你阻止战争
I'll help you stop this war.

359
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,870
然后就到此为止
But then, I'm done.

360
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,670
也许那样最好
Maybe that's for the best.

361
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:43,290
海洋不仅仅是我们的生命之源  亚瑟
The ocean is more than our life source, Arthur.

362
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,690
海洋就是我们本身
It is who we are.

363
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,790
慢着  你可以在水下说话
Wait, you can talk underwater?

364
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:50,300
我也可以在水下说话
I can talk underwater, too!

365
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,560
太厉害了
This is awesome!

366
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:55,540
我们能做的可不止是说话
Oh, we can do more than just talk.

367
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:06,680
作为亚特兰蒂斯人不仅仅意味着你能在水里呼吸
Being Atlantean means more than just being able to breathe water.

368
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:11,680
你的身体能够承受极端的寒冷和压力
Your body is equipped to survive the extreme cold and pressure,

369
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:14,220
你的眼睛能够适应黑暗
and your eyes adjust to see in the dark.

370
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,580
太厉害了
This is awesome!

371
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:10,780
维科  我什么时候能见我妈妈
So, Vulko, when can I meet my mother?

372
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,250
很快  小王子
Soon, my young prince.

373
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:19,650
等你准备好了  我带你去亚特兰蒂斯见王后
When you're ready, I'll take you to Atlantis to meet the queen.

374
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,800
我把我的船藏在了这里
I hid my ship in here.

375
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,300
听着  我才不要上这破船
Listen, I'm not getting in that thing.

376
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,240
要想去到我们的目的地  你就必须上船
Well, to get where we're going, you're gonna have to.

377
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,400
你的渔船在一直泡在三文鱼油里吧
Your fish ship has been marinating in chum butter.

378
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:41,410
我下船的时候肯定全身都是沼泽的臭味
I'm gonna come out smelling like swamp butt.

379
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,140
你现在比那还臭
That'd be an improvement.

380
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,720
好吧
Yup. Okay.

381
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:48,580
亚特兰蒂斯王国

382
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,580
在水下建一座桥有什么意义
What's the point in having a bridge underwater?

383
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,980
门桥是旧世界的遗迹
The Gateway Bridge is a remnant of the Old World.

384
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,980
也是进出首府的唯一路径
It's also the only way in or out of the Capital.

385
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,520
为什么不直接翻墙过去
Why can't they just go over the walls?

386
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,150
防卫牢不可破
Security is impenetrable.

387
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,890
即使他们成功躲过了守卫
Even if they did manage to evade the guards,

388
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:04,820
也不可能躲过水加农炮
they'd never get past the hydro-cannons.

389
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,860
人们总是想偷偷溜进去
People try to sneak in all the time.

390
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,800
好吧
Yeah, right.

391
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,050
那是什么
What is this?

392
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,490
海关及边境管制
Customs and border control.

393
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:38,490
别担心  我有外交通行证
Don't worry. I have diplomatic clearance.

394
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:47,370
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

395
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,280
旧城里有安全屋
There's a safe house down in the Old City.

396
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,550
血统高贵的族人从不下到海底
The Highborns never venture to the sea floor.

397
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:42,560
我们到了
We're here.

398
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,480
这是哪里
What is this?

399
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:15,820
这个气穴是额外的预防措施
We use this air pocket as an extra layer of precaution.

400
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,390
只有血统高贵的族人才能在水中自由呼吸
Only the Highborns can breathe water as well as air.

401
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:20,230
而且还能把动物们挡在外面
Plus, it keeps the animals out.

402
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:23,100
它们会弄得很乱
They get kind of messy.

403
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,600
维科  我来了  老伙计
Vulko. Here I am, old man.

404
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,640
这么多年了  你终于得到你想要的了
After all these years, you finally get what you wanted.

405
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:37,110
亚瑟  真希望不是在这种情况下和你重逢
Arthur, I wish it was under better circumstances.

406
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:39,440
真不敢相信奥姆竟然袭击了陆地
I can't believe Orm attacked.

407
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,380
那还不是袭击
It wasn't an attack.

408
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,710
按照律法  他现在还不能这么做
Legally, he's not allowed to yet.

409
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,150
但是他破坏你们的陆地战舰是一个警告
What he did to your surface warships was merely a warning.

410
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,690
为什么
What provoked it?

411
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:51,320
奥姆国王和你的父亲被陆地人埋伏了
King Orm and your father were ambushed by the surface.

412
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,960
被陆地人  我可不觉得
By the surface? I don't think so.

413
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,890
他们现在还以为亚特兰蒂斯只是一个神话
They still think Atlantis is a fairy tale.

414
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:57,590
我也在场
I was there.

415
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,460
一艘陆地军舰朝我们开火
A surface warship fired at us.

416
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:02,200
现在泽贝尔和亚特兰蒂斯结盟了
Now, Xebel sides with Atlantis,

417
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,150
加强了奥姆手中的兵力
giving Orm a fleet big enough

418
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:07,100
让他能够强迫其他两个王国加入他
to force the other two kingdoms to join him.

419
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:11,680
如果我们要阻止这场战争  你必须推翻他
If we're going to prevent this war, you must dethrone him now.

420
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,940
我要和你说多少遍  我不想做国王
How many times do I have to tell you? I don't wanna be king.

421
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:16,710
你还不明白
You don't understand.

422
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,220
等他成为海洋领主  那就太迟了
Once he is named Ocean Master, it'll be too late.

423
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,590
他的权力
The power at his disposal

424
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:22,950
将会是你无法想象的
will be unlike anything you have ever seen.

425
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:25,620
我是从陆地上来的  没人会把我放在眼里的
I'm from the surface. No one is gonna take me seriously.

426
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:27,190
我都不知道该从哪里开始
Okay? I don't even know where to begin.

427
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:29,660
先从证明你自己值得拥戴
By winning the hearts and minds of the people

428
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:34,400
取回这个  赢得人心和民意开始
by proving to them that you're worthy, and retrieving this.

429
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:42,710
我已经有一个了
I already got one of those.

430
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,210
这个不一样  你没有
Not like this one, you don't.

431
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:48,880
这是亚特兰失落三叉戟
This is the Lost Trident of Atlan.

432
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,110
我知道这个传说
Oh, I know the story.

433
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,620
这不仅仅是个传说  这是真的
It's more than a story. It's real.

434
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:58,660
这是有史以来最伟大的武器锻造师
It was forged by the greatest weapon masters in history.

435
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:02,430
用波塞冬寒铁  为亚特兰蒂斯首位统治者
Crafted from Poseidon's steel for King Atlan,

436
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:06,430
亚特兰王所铸造的
the first ruler of Atlantis.

437
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,860
传说这柄三叉戟中
Legend says the trident

438
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:10,670
注入了能统治海洋的力量
was imbued with the power to command the sea.

439
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,870
然后这柄三叉戟怎么样了
So what happened to it?

440
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:17,470
这要追溯到一切陨落之前
To know that is to go back to the time before the Great Fall,

441
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,710
那时候亚特兰王还是统治者
when King Atlan ruled over all that was,

442
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:24,480
亚特兰蒂斯也还只有一个王国
when the kingdoms of Atlantis were one.

443
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:33,420
那时候科技进步  国家繁荣
It was a time of great prosperity and technological advancement.

444
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:36,060
在世界的其他角落还以为地球是平的时
We had unlocked the secret of unlimited energy

445
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,790
我们已经发掘了
at a time when the rest of the world

446
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,530
无限能源的奥秘
still thought the earth was flat.

447
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,200
但是我们的野心膨胀了
But we became too ambitious,

448
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,870
对权力愈加渴求
too hungry for power.

449
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:07,590
海洋吞噬了我们  亚特兰蒂斯沉没了
The ocean swallowed us, and Atlantis sank.

450
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,100
但是让我们的文明崩塌的力量
But the very power that collapsed our civilization

451
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,400
也为我们开拓了通往未来的大道
also paved the way to our future.

452
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,600
我们被赋予了能在水下呼吸的能力
It gave us the ability to breathe underwater.

453
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,310
于是  我们进化了
And so, we evolved.

454
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:25,480
退化的人则变成了野鱼人
Others regressed, became savage.

455
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,890
国王则在自我放逐中
And the king lived out the remainder of his days

456
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:32,620
过完了余生
in self-imposed exile.

457
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:36,990
再也没有人见过他和那柄三叉戟
Neither he nor the trident were ever seen again.

458
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:41,260
我们有一支考古小队几个月前发现了这个
One of our archeological teams uncovered this a few months ago.

459
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:45,130
这是一则能追溯到第一代王朝的古记录
It's an ancient recording dating back to the First Dynasty.

460
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:48,870
我相信这里面有亚特兰王给人民留下的最后的信息
I believe it contains Atlan's final message to his people

461
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:51,940
以及神圣三叉戟的所在之处
and the whereabouts of the Sacred Trident.

462
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,370
这上面怎么说
So, what does it say?

463
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,140
我们不知道  这所使用的科技太古老
We don't know. The technology's too old.

464
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:59,910
这根管子上有迷失国的标志
The cylinder bears the markings of the Deserter Kingdom.

465
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:02,710
你得带到那里  得到信息
You must take it there and retrieve the message.

466
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:06,680
亚特兰王安息之处的线索就藏在这里
The clue to Atlan's final resting place is inside of this.

467
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:27,100
边境护卫队  你因非法入侵而被捕了
Border Defense. You are under arrest for illegal entry.

468
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,310
不
No!

469
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:31,840
不能被人看到你在这里
You mustn't be seen here!

470
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:29,770
你肯定不想好好聊聊吧
I don't suppose you want to talk about this, do you?

471
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:36,370
我也不想
Neither do I.

472
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:20,780
我以国王奥姆陛下之名宣布  你被捕了
In the name of His Highness, King Orm, I place you under arrest.

473
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,010
欢迎来到亚特兰蒂斯
Welcome to Atlantis...

474
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:45,410
哥哥
Brother.

475
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,410
真不敢相信  你终于来了
I can't believe you're finally here.

476
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:56,650
我听了太多关于你的故事
I've heard so many stories about you.

477
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:05,630
这么多年来  我一直以我的父亲
All these years, I've been ashamed of my mother

478
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:09,770
委身于一个陆地人而为辱
for defiling herself with a surface-dweller.

479
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:12,830
以我有一个混血的哥哥为辱
Ashamed of the fact that I have a half-breed brother

480
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:16,770
我多想用我的三叉戟戳穿你的心脏
whose heart I wanted to run my trident through.

481
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:21,180
但你现在终于来到了我的面前  我承认
But now that you're finally here before me, I must admit...

482
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:30,480
我很矛盾
I am conflicted.

483
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:32,790
你想要冲突吗[矛盾]
You want conflict,

484
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:35,460
不如解开我的链子  弟弟
why don't you take these chains off, little brother?

485
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,390
我们就知道谁能笑到最后了
And we'll see who gets run through.

486
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,770
看来你带来了我们母亲的武器
Yes, I see you've brought our mother's weapon.

487
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:48,470
过去了这么久  你就是为此而来的吗
Is that why you've come here after all this time?

488
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:50,070
为了杀了我
To kill me?

489
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:52,870
我是来组织一个疯子毁灭世界
I came here to stop a maniac from destroying the world.

490
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,810
我知道了
I see.

491
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:56,640
你要怎么阻止陆地人
And how do you plan to stop the atrocities

492
00:51:56,650 --> 00:52:00,580
一直以来的暴行
that the surface continues to commit?

493
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:05,350
因为这一个世纪以来  他们污染我们的水域
Because for a century, they have polluted our waters

494
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,690
毒害我们的孩子
and poisoned our children.

495
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:12,260
现在  他们烧红了天空  大洋也为之沸腾
And now, their skies burn and our oceans boil.

496
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,080
你花了这么大的力气
And you've come all this way

497
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,970
只是为了站在你族人的对立面吗
to take sides against your own people?

498
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:20,130
这种战争根本没有什么站边
There are no sides in a war like this.

499
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:21,850
你显然已经选择了自己的站边
You have clearly chosen a side

500
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:22,870
来这里妄图挑战王位
and come here to challenge the throne.

501
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:24,910
如果只有那样才能阻止你的战争
If that's what it takes to stop your war.

502
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,840
你要发起国王挑战吗
Are you invoking the Combat of the Kings?

503
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:34,150
随你怎么说  我看就是打你屁股
Call it whatever you want. I call it an ass-whooping.

504
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:36,680
那我们不如就这么办吧
Well then, perhaps that's how we'll proceed.

505
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:38,450
-陛下  -奥姆  别
- Your Majesty! - Orm, please.

506
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:39,850
你们还不明白吗
Don't you see?

507
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,890
如果我在所有人的见证下
If I defeat the firstborn son of Atlanna

508
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:44,360
在正式挑战中打败了亚特兰娜的长子
in a formal challenge in front of everyone,

509
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,110
那七大王国
then all Seven Kingdoms

510
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:49,460
就必须承认我是真正的国王
will have to concede that I am the one true king.

511
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:53,470
陛下  击败无知者没有胜利可言
Your Majesty, there is no victory in defeating the ignorant.

512
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,070
你哥哥显然是个低能儿
Your brother is clearly an imbecile.

513
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,010
陛下  他不懂我们的方式
Your Highness, he doesn't know our ways.

514
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:01,140
那他就要被好好教育一番
Then he's about to get an education.

515
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,650
你要正式挑战我吗
Are you officially challenging me?

516
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:06,850
没错  我要挑战你  等我赢了
Hell yes, I challenge you. And when I win...

517
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,380
如果你赢了
If you win,

518
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:12,090
我将停止一切举动  战争结束
I will cease all immediate action. The war is over.

519
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,560
但如果我赢了
But if I win...

520
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:17,490
你就完了
You're over.

521
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:19,790
来吧
Let's do it.

522
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:21,430
那就这么定了
So be it.

523
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:24,460
挑战已经提出  我接受了
Challenge has been made, and I accept.

524
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:26,930
让他准备好上烈焰之环
Prepare him for the Ring of Fire.

525
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:30,140
等等  什么环
Wait. The ring of what?

526
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:52,130
你怎么能如此愚蠢地被奥姆下套进行战斗
How could you be so foolish to let Orm bait you into a fight?

527
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:54,830
我倒是觉得我解决了我们的问题
It seems to me like I just solved all of our problems.

528
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:57,130
我打赢他  战争就结束了  我就能回家了
I beat him in a battle, war's over, I get to go home.

529
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:59,370
你在陆地上是一名优秀的战士
You're a formidable fighter on land,

530
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:01,900
但是你在这里根本无法发挥
but here you're out of your element, literally.

531
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,700
奥姆一直都在水下生活
Orm has spent his entire life underwater,

532
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:08,410
进行作战训练  进行精英训练
training to be a warrior, training to be the best.

533
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:10,580
是你教会了我怎么战斗  眼镜蛇
You taught me how to fight, Cobra Kai.

534
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,710
看看你还记不记得
Let's see if you remember anything.

535
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:17,820
这大叉子是用来干什么的
So, what's with the big fork?

536
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:20,590
这是三叉戟  防住
It's a trident. Now, defend yourself.

537
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:55,650
这是什么东西
What the hell is this?

538
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,960
等你能熟练掌握三叉戟的用法  我会教你这一招
I'll teach you this move when you've mastered the trident.

539
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,640
这不公平
It's not fair.

540
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,710
这东西又大又笨重  我为什么不能用剑
This thing is so big and awkward. Why can't I use a sword?

541
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:15,480
那是你妈妈的三叉戟  皇家传统武器
That's your mother's trident. A traditional weapon of royalty.

542
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:19,080
只有你能熟练掌握  你才能成为国王
You'll never be a king until you've mastered it.

543
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,750
那她为什么从来不来看我
Why has she never come to see me, huh?

544
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,880
我说了  等你准备好
I told you, when you're ready...

545
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,990
不要再骗我了  我做了你要我做到的所有事
Stop lying to me! I've done everything you ever asked.

546
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,820
我每次通过一关  你就会给我另一关
And every time I pass a test, you make up another one.

547
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:31,260
我什么时候才能变得足够好
When am I gonna be good enough?

548
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,030
她不爱我吗
Does she not love me?

549
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:41,270
你妈妈爱你甚于这世上的一切
Your mother loved you more than anything in the world.

550
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:45,100
但是她必须要回到亚特兰蒂斯  才能保护你
But she had to return to Atlantis to keep you safe.

551
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:48,470
她和欧瓦克国王的亲事很早以前就定了下来
Her marriage to King Orvax was arranged a long time ago,

552
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,180
所以她必须要嫁给他
so she had to marry him...

553
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,650
给他生下一子  奥姆王子
And bear him a son, Prince Orm.

554
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:55,980
当欧瓦克发现了你的存在
When Orvax eventually found out about you,

555
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:58,550
他被嫉妒所吞噬
he became overwhelmed with jealousy

556
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:03,220
将她献祭给了海沟族的海怪
and sacrificed her to the creatures of the Trench.

557
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:08,560
你是说他们处决了她吗
Are you saying they executed her?

558
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,070
因为她生下了我
Because she had me?

559
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:27,550
我记得
I remember...

560
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:28,850
一切
Everything.

561
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:35,250
我有东西要给你
I have something for you.

562
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,360
这原本是我母亲的
It belonged to my mother.

563
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:41,860
告诉我
Tell me...

564
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,600
你觉得她会希望
Do you think she would have enjoyed

565
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,370
看到自己的儿子们互相残杀吗
watching her sons murder each other?

566
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:51,470
我明白你的恐惧和抗拒  媚拉
I understand your fear and your reluctance, Mera.

567
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:54,810
真的  我不想要战争
I truly do. I don't want war...

568
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:56,210
别想安抚我
Don't patronize me!

569
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:57,680
我了解你
I know you.

570
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,380
你所做的一切都违背了
What you're doing flies in the face of everything

571
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:01,350
我们年少时  你母亲教导我们的一切
that your mother taught us when we were children.

572
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:02,450
要是她还在
If she were here...

573
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:06,420
但她不在这里
But she's not here, is she?

574
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:09,120
我的母亲教会我们叛变
What my mother taught us was treason.

575
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:12,690
不要追随她的脚步
Don't follow in her wake.

576
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:15,630
好了  这是一个又大又古老的火焰环
All right! So, this is the big, old ring of fire, huh?

577
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:18,770
怎么玩  我就在这里暴揍你吗
How's it work? I just kick your ass right here?

578
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:23,770
维科
Vulko.

579
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:27,740
请护送我的未婚妻去皇家座席
Will you escort my betrothed to the royal box?

580
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:40,650
走吧  梅拉公主
Let's go, Lady Mera.

581
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:50,560
我们这里有一个关于卡拉森的神话
Down here, we have a legend about the Karathen,

582
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,990
那是一种强大的海怪
an ancient sea monster so powerful

583
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:55,470
连亚特兰王也要惧上三分
that even King Atlan himself feared it.

584
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:59,870
于是他将它关在海洋的深处
So, he imprisoned it in the depths of the ocean.

585
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:04,580
那个怪兽就在深渊中等待着东山再起的一天
And in that abyss, the creature bides its time waiting to rise again.

586
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:08,210
亚特兰蒂斯一直在等待
Atlantis has been lying in wait...

587
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:10,120
现在  这怪兽苏醒了
And now, the beast has awakened.

588
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:22,060
曾经  我无比地想要见上你一面
You know here was a time when I wanted to meet you more than anything.

589
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,360
我想认识我的弟弟
Get to know my little brother.

590
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:29,970
让他知道他不是一个人  我们有彼此
Let him know that he wasn't alone, that we were in it together.

591
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:35,340
要是我知道你会变成这样一个混蛋
If only I had known what a dick you would turn out to be.

592
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:42,210
我们的母亲是因为你才被处决的
You were the reason our mother was executed.

593
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:44,820
从那以后我就一直恨你
And I've hated you for it ever since.

594
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:50,790
但我不想杀死你  亚瑟
But I do not want to kill you, Arthur.

595
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:54,030
我要再给你一次机会
I'm going to give you one chance.

596
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:57,060
回家吧
Go home.

597
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:59,970
不要再回到亚特兰蒂斯了
Do not ever come back to Atlantis.

598
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,440
你赢不了的
You are not going to win this.

599
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:08,240
不管你愿不愿意  我们必要和陆地人开战
A war is coming to the surface whether you like it or not.

600
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,880
我要带着七大海的愤怒
And I am bringing the wrath of the seven seas with me.

601
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:15,180
你知道我不会放任不管的
You know I can't let that happen.

602
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:18,020
我知道
I know.

603
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,360
那是什么声音
What the hell is that?

604
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:25,960
烈焰之环
The Ring of Fire.

605
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:48,910
该死
Shit.

606
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,650
亚特兰蒂斯的人民  听好了
People of Atlantis, hear me!

607
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:55,120
我来自陆地的哥哥
My brother has come from the surface

608
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:56,520
要来挑战我的王位
to challenge me for the throne.

609
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:01,490
让我们用古老的办法解决他的挑衅
Let us settle his claim in the ancient way.

610
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:06,030
浴血方能明神意
By bloodshed do the gods make known their will!

611
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:17,010
叛徒
Traitor!

612
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,010
叛徒
Traitor!

613
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:26,580
奥姆·马略斯国王
优势
亚特兰蒂斯之王
出身高贵
战士
思想家
泽贝尔第八位航海家
珊瑚之心荣誉奖章
依格马拉松冠军
五次水下三叉戟大赛冠军
劣势

614
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:26,580
混血种
优势
劣势
陆地人
混血种
酗酒

615
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:26,520
你永远成不了国王
You'll never be king!

616
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:42,800
没想到我能看到我的父亲
Never thought I'd see the day when my own father

617
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,630
在亚特兰蒂斯国王面前低头
would bow before the king of Atlantis.

618
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:48,670
陆地人先出手的  你指望我们怎么办
The surface-dwellers drew first blood. What would you have us do?

619
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:50,140
求他们饶我们一命吗
Beg them for mercy?

620
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:52,510
我和你一样讨厌陆地人
I detest the surface as much as you do.

621
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:55,850
但你不觉得这一切发生的时机有点太凑巧了吗
But don't you find the timing of all of this a bit convenient?

622
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:03,120
但是你没有那么好骗  对吗
But you wouldn't be that gullible, would you?

623
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:07,730
你也想要发动这场战争
You want this war too, don't you?

624
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:10,330
那些陆地人已经不安于待在地面上了
It is past time the surface-dwellers learned their place in the world.

625
01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:13,060
如果必须要这么做的话  那只能放手去做了
If this is how it must be done, then so be it.

626
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:21,300
你有我们母亲的三叉戟
You have our mother's trident.

627
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:24,510
很强大  但是和她一样残缺
Powerful, but flawed like her.

628
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:26,980
我继承了我父亲的
I wield my father's.

629
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:29,980
这柄戟还未尝一败
And it has never known defeat!

630
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:21,030
我向亚特兰娜保证过我会保护她
I promised Atlanna I'd protect him.

631
01:02:28,310 --> 01:02:31,680
这不是比赛  这是处决
This isn't a competition. It's an execution.

632
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:32,460
我才是唯一真正的国王
I am the one true king!

633
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:18,140
你还在等我要请你吗  快进来
You waiting for an invitation? Get in!

634
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:30,250
媚拉
Mera!

635
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,960
好吧  我们有什么计划
Oh, yeah. So, what's the plan?

636
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,090
计划就是找回亚特兰的三叉戟  然后挑战奥姆
The plan was to recover Atlan's trident, then challenge Orm.

637
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,830
好吧  那我们的顺序有点反了
Okay, so we're doing things a little out of order.

638
01:05:39,830 --> 01:05:40,830
意外总会有的
Shit happens.

639
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,340
小心  六点钟方向有飞行物
Heads up! We got a bogey on our six!

640
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:50,600
-这话是什么意思  -后面有坏人
- What does that even mean? - Bad guys behind us.

641
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:53,370
-那就直接这么说就行了  -后面有坏人
- Then just say that! - Bad guys behind us!

642
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:02,980
等等  你说过我们不能翻过这些墙
Whoa, whoa, wait, you said we couldn't go over these walls.

643
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:04,980
-是的  -你说有水加农炮
- I did! - You said there were hydro-cannons!

644
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,250
是的  闭嘴
I did, now shut up!

645
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:12,590
该死
Oh, shit!

646
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:37,310
该死
Shit!

647
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:39,680
该死
Shit!

648
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,690
我们还没死  但我希望他以为我们死了
We're not dead yet! But I'm hoping he'll think we are.

649
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:54,300
抓着这个
Here, hold this.

650
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:57,630
你在干什么
What are you doing?

651
01:07:57,630 --> 01:07:59,470
-听着  匹诺曹就是这样得救的  -谁
- Listen, it worked for Pinocchio. - Who?

652
01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:02,270
没谁  过来  进去  快点
Never mind. Come here, get in. Come on.

653
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,410
太好了  现在我们要被吃了
Great. So we're getting eaten.

654
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:30,130
你到底是怎么做到的
How are you even doing this, anyway?

655
01:08:30,130 --> 01:08:31,900
我不知道
I don't know.

656
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,470
我有时能懂它们说话  它们有时也能懂我
I can hear them sometimes, and they can hear me.

657
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:37,340
没错  因为你们都是又大又蠢的动物
Right. Because you're both big, dumb animals.

658
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:39,870
-我刚救了你的命呢  -我先救你的
- Hey, I just saved your life. - I saved yours first!

659
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:46,380
它说"没有危险了"
She said, "Coast is clear."

660
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:48,520
那我们现在去哪里
So, where to now?

661
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:53,420
去一片被你们称作撒哈拉的沙漠
To the ocean of sand your people call the Sahara.

662
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:55,890
好
All right.

663
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:15,440
西撒哈拉

664
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:21,010
我一般不接受包租
I don't usually take charters,

665
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:23,550
但一般也不会有人付我海盗宝藏
but I don't usually get paid in pirate treasure.

666
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:24,820
谢谢你载我们  伙计
Thanks for the ride, buddy.

667
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:28,790
天啊
Oh, man.

668
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:30,560
你没事吧
Are you okay?

669
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,760
我从来没有到过这么高的地方
I've never been so high up before.

670
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,500
或者离家这么远
Or so far from home.

671
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,370
但至少你还有家
But at least you have a home.

672
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:41,700
已经没有了
Not anymore.

673
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:43,400
我不能再回去了
I can never go back.

674
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:46,370
当我从竞技场里把你救下  我就背叛了一切
I betrayed everything when I saved you from the coliseum.

675
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:53,550
但你和国王订婚了  他们必须接纳你
Yeah, but you're engaged to the king. They have to take you back.

676
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:56,720
亚特兰蒂斯有很多优点
Atlantis is many wonderful things.

677
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:58,620
但不包括宽恕
But forgiving, it is not.

678
01:09:58,620 --> 01:09:59,950
嗯  但你是皇室
Yeah, but you're royalty.

679
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:02,260
你母亲也曾经是
So was your mother.

680
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:05,120
如果我现在回去  我就会被献祭给海沟族
If I went back now, I'd be sacrificed to the Trench.

681
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:07,830
连我的父亲都不会接纳我
Even my own father wouldn't take me back.

682
01:10:12,370 --> 01:10:14,300
往好处看
Look on the bright side,

683
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:15,180
现在你不用嫁给
now you don't have to marry

684
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:16,570
某个你根本就不爱的混蛋了
some tool bag that you're not in love with.

685
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:19,770
我的责任不是爱
My obligation isn't to love.

686
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:22,340
而是要为我的家庭和国家
It is to my family and my nation,

687
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:24,410
而我背弃了这两者
and I've turned my back on both.

688
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:30,480
有时候  你不得不做出正确的事
Sometimes, you have to do what's right,

689
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,420
即便你会因此心痛
even if your heart aches against it.

690
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:51,640
陛下
Your Highness.

691
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:56,740
追踪器显示媚拉公主在迷失国
The tracker places Princess Mera here, in the Deserter Kingdom.

692
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:58,810
你说她死了
You said she was dead.

693
01:10:59,410 --> 01:11:00,880
显然没有
Apparently not.

694
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,080
那说明你哥哥也还活着
Then your brother still lives as well?

695
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:05,420
活不了太久了
Not for long.

696
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:07,420
穆克队长  马上集结先锋队
Captain Murk, assemble a strike force immediately.

697
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:12,160
不  必须逮捕媚拉并安全送到我手上
No! Mera is to be arrested and safely returned to me.

698
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:13,330
她背叛了王权
She betrayed the throne.

699
01:11:13,330 --> 01:11:15,730
她是泽贝尔的女儿
She is a daughter of Xebel.

700
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:18,700
如果她受到任何伤害  我们的联盟也就此终了
If any harm befalls her, our coalition is over.

701
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:20,270
陛下
Your Highness,

702
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:23,670
我们正在进入鱼人国的水域
we are now entering the waters of the Fishermen Kingdom.

703
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:27,770
我们现在首要考虑的应该是
Securing the alliance of the other two kingdoms

704
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:29,880
维护和另外两国的联盟
should be our immediate concern.

705
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:38,980
我的宰相一如既往地正确
My vizier is correct. As usual.

706
01:11:38,990 --> 01:11:45,490
逮捕他们  将涅柔斯国王的女儿毫发无伤地带回
Arrest them and bring back King Nereus' daughter unharmed.

707
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:09,880
我们到了
We're here!

708
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:14,090
这附近有东西吗
Is there anything nearby?

709
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:16,190
只有延绵好几公里的沙漠  伙计
Nothing but desert for hundreds of K's, mate!

710
01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:18,220
-只有沙漠  -他错了
- Nothing but desert. - He's wrong.

711
01:12:18,230 --> 01:12:21,290
你干什么  等等  不
Hey! What are you doing? Wait! No! Oh...

712
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,860
她跳了下去  她都没有降落伞
She just jumped! She didn't have a parachute!

713
01:12:26,870 --> 01:12:29,370
红发疯子  不得不爱
Redheads! You gotta love 'em.

714
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,650
该死
Shit!

715
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,600
你比我以为的还要疯
Oh, you're crazier than I thought!

716
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:04,600
这边
This way.

717
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:11,300
印度洋某处

718
01:13:25,690 --> 01:13:27,500
你上次被打败了
You were defeated the last time

719
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,260
是因为你的陆地武器不够强
because your surface weapons failed you.

720
01:13:30,230 --> 01:13:31,360
我们的不一样
Ours will not.

721
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:39,170
这是下一代亚特兰蒂斯士兵盔甲的原型
It's prototype armor for the next generation Atlantean soldier.

722
01:13:39,170 --> 01:13:41,910
我们亚特兰蒂斯人最是理解复仇
Revenge is something we Atlanteans understand.

723
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,280
我的精锐先锋队将听从你的指挥
You will lead my finest commandos as your personal army

724
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,850
找到那个混血杂种
to hunt down the half-breed abomination.

725
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:52,350
我动不了他们  但你可以  他逃到了你们的世界
I cannot touch them, but you can. He's fled to your world.

726
01:13:52,350 --> 01:13:55,820
杀死他和跟他一起的那个女人  我会给你报酬
Kill him and the woman he's with, and you will be rewarded.

727
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:58,120
杀死他就是我的报酬
Killing him is my reward.

728
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:03,960
权杖  还处于实验开发阶段
The crown jewel. Still experimental.

729
01:14:05,530 --> 01:14:08,400
能将水转化成带电等离子束
Converts water into beams of energized plasma.

730
01:15:22,170 --> 01:15:24,680
我觉得我需要更大的头盔
I think I'm gonna need a bigger helmet.

731
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:27,280
当初  这里还是一片内陆海时
One of the tribes of Atlantis broke off and settled here

732
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,450
有一支亚特兰蒂斯部族逃到了这里
when this region was still an inland sea.

733
01:15:29,450 --> 01:15:32,280
当这里的水都干了  他们也随之消失了
When the water dried up, they perished along with it.

734
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,020
消失了  真是太棒了
Perished? Yeah, that's terrific.

735
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:35,250
我们越来越接近了
We're getting close now.

736
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:37,720
是吗  接近什么  快渴死了吗
Oh, yeah? Close to what? Dying of thirst?

737
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:39,690
你快要被当脸揍上一拳了
Close to getting punched in the face!

738
01:15:39,690 --> 01:15:41,490
听着  疯子  我知道你还不知道这儿的情况
Look, Fight Club, I know you're new to how things work up here.

739
01:15:41,490 --> 01:15:43,790
不如你看看周围  我们迷路了
Why don't you look around? We are lost.

740
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,400
你看那边  那是什么
You see that over there? Hey, what is that?

741
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:48,160
什么都没有  这里就是一片荒芜
Nada. This place is a wasteland.

742
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:50,670
是你把这一片荒芜当作家园的
You're the one who calls this wasteland a home.

743
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:52,300
这不是我的家园
This isn't my home!

744
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,140
不是所有的陆地都长这样
It's not like the whole surface looks like this!

745
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:56,070
不  当然了
Oh, no, of course not.

746
01:15:56,070 --> 01:15:57,310
你们还有各种恶心的城市
You've also got disgusting cities

747
01:15:57,310 --> 01:15:59,310
把废水都排到我们海洋里
whose sewers empty out into our ocean

748
01:15:59,310 --> 01:16:01,210
还有一堆堆的垃圾山
and whole mountains made out of trash.

749
01:16:01,210 --> 01:16:02,910
你们还有一堆大公司
And, oh, you've got great factories

750
01:16:02,910 --> 01:16:04,820
只会喷废料  融冰山
that do nothing but belch out filth and melt ice caps.

751
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:06,880
好吧  知道了  听着
Okay. Point taken. Listen.

752
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,350
我们的确有不少蠢货
Yeah, we got some idiots running the show,

753
01:16:08,350 --> 01:16:10,350
但我们也有好的方面  好吗
but we've got some good things too, all right?

754
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:12,620
我们有绿色的森林  高大的山丘和美丽的湖泊
We got green forests and big mountains and beautiful lakes.

755
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:15,460
你肯定会喜欢的  那就像是海洋宝宝
You'd love 'em. They're like little baby oceans.

756
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:17,290
你想激怒我吗
Are you trying to provoke me?

757
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:19,000
我只是说你不能看都不看就对一个地方下定论
I'm just saying you cannot judge a place before you've even seen it.

758
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,830
你反正也对亚特兰蒂斯下定论
You've judged Atlantis on far less.

759
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:28,770
不  你能不能停一下  不
No. Would you just stop it with that? No.

760
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:30,750
你那愚蠢的亚特兰蒂斯定位器
Your stupid Atlantean GPS

761
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:32,380
让我们从飞机上
just told you to jump out of an airplane

762
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:34,340
跳到沙漠中央  现在我们迷路了
over the middle of the desert, and now we are stranded.

763
01:16:37,650 --> 01:16:40,290
如果你真的是下一任真正的国王  我们就完蛋了
If you're the next true king, we're doomed.

764
01:17:03,610 --> 01:17:06,880
迷失国

765
01:17:08,610 --> 01:17:09,950
真是太刺激了
That was awesome.

766
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,960
看看我找到了什么
Oh. Look what I found.

767
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,260
你找到的
What you found?

768
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:21,260
没错
Yeah.

769
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:33,370
看看这个地方
Check this place out.

770
01:17:33,970 --> 01:17:35,600
真是太厉害了
This is badass!

771
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:39,640
这里是军械大厅
This is the Hall of Armory.

772
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:42,980
就是传说中亚特兰的三叉戟铸造的地方
Where the legends say Atlan's trident was forged.

773
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:46,480
我不再觉得那是传说了
I don't think they're legends anymore.

774
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:54,160
维科说得没错
Vulko was right.

775
01:17:56,690 --> 01:17:58,130
这是真的
It's real.

776
01:18:37,230 --> 01:18:39,200
什么都没有
Nothing.

777
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,570
当然不会有用了
Of course it's not working.

778
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:42,520
自从撒哈拉变成沙漠后
It's been sitting here collecting dust

779
01:18:42,530 --> 01:18:44,200
这里就一直在积灰
since before the Sahara was a desert.

780
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:47,540
天
Man!

781
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:50,580
"自从撒哈拉变成沙漠后"
"Since before the Sahara was a desert."

782
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:52,750
谢谢你重复了我说的话
Thank you for repeating what I just said.

783
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:54,620
这里都干了
It's completely dried out.

784
01:18:56,550 --> 01:18:58,120
只能说你什么都不想的时候
Let's just say you do your best thinking

785
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:00,120
才是你最机智的时候
when you're not thinking at all.

786
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,190
好  站着别动
All right, now hold still.

787
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:03,460
你要干什么
Hey. What are you doing?

788
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:06,600
我们需要水  你是最近的水源
We need water, and you're the closest source.

789
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,230
别动
Now, hold still.

790
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:46,540
瞎显摆
Show-off.

791
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:49,040
我也可以尿点尿到上面
I could have just peed on it.

792
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:00,650
亚特兰王
King Atlan.

793
01:20:02,650 --> 01:20:07,790
这把三叉戟蕴藏着亚特兰蒂斯的力量
In this trident resides the power of Atlantis.

794
01:20:07,790 --> 01:20:11,690
如果落入坏人之手  它将带来毁灭
In the wrong hands, it would bring destruction.

795
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:13,960
但是如果到了真正的继承者手里
But in the hands of the true heir,

796
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:18,070
它将联合海陆所有王国的力量
it would unite all our kingdoms above and below.

797
01:20:18,070 --> 01:20:23,000
如果想得到我的力量  你必须证明你的价值
If you seek my power, you must prove your worth.

798
01:20:23,010 --> 01:20:26,540
前往世界尽头之外的暗海
Journey beyond the edge of the world to the Hidden Sea.

799
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:29,810
从瓶子里寻找航海路线
Look inside the bottle for the charted path.

800
01:20:29,810 --> 01:20:35,550
只有在真正的国王手中  才能真正看到
Only in the hands of the true king can he truly see.

801
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:53,130
我们不能让奥姆找到这个
We can't let Orm find this.

802
01:20:55,570 --> 01:20:56,740
等等
Hey! Wait!

803
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,370
怎么
What?

804
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:01,170
我们不应该先写下来吗
Shouldn't we have written it down first?

805
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:03,280
我已经记住了  你没记住吗
I memorized it. Didn't you?

806
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,450
当然  当然记住了
Oh, yeah. Totally.

807
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:09,320
他说什么了
What'd he just say?

808
01:21:11,150 --> 01:21:13,360
"什么什么三叉戟..."
"Something something trident."

809
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:30,610
"从瓶子里寻找航海路线"
"Look inside the bottle for the charted path."

810
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:38,580
这是我们的下一站
It's our next stop.

811
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:45,570
意大利  西西里

812
01:23:12,370 --> 01:23:15,270
我开始觉得你其实喜欢这些陆地人了
I'm starting to think you actually like these surface-dwellers.

813
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:18,210
不能看都不看就对一个地方下定论
It would be wrong to judge a place I've never seen before.

814
01:23:20,350 --> 01:23:22,820
我马上回来  哪里都别去
I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere.

815
01:23:41,970 --> 01:23:45,840
显然  就在那座山的顶上有一座旧城堡
Well, apparently, it's just right up on the hill. A big old castle.

816
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:48,710
我刚发现了一件非常有趣的事
And I just learned something very interesting.

817
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:50,710
《匹诺曹》

818
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:50,810
《匹诺曹》
Pinocchio.

819
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,750
你让我们逃生的方法
You risked our lives based

820
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:55,180
是从儿童书里看到的吗
on something you read in a children's book?

821
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:58,480
等等  是书里的吗  真不可思议
Wait, it's a book? How about that?

822
01:23:59,890 --> 01:24:01,290
我是从电影里看到的
I got it from the movie.

823
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:10,230
涅柔斯国王  我曾希望我们的子民
King Nereus, I had hoped our people had evolved

824
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:10,650
鱼人国

825
01:24:10,230 --> 01:24:12,400
不再认同那古老的思想
beyond that ancient notion

826
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,630
认为我们与陆地的战争不可避免
that war with the surface is inevitable.

827
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:17,470
鱼人的立场是
It is the position of the Fishermen

828
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:20,740
如果要让陆地人知道我们
that when the time comes to make ourselves known to the landsmen,

829
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:24,610
那应该是我们去教育他们  而不是毁灭他们
it should be to educate them, not to destroy them.

830
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:28,680
我钦佩你的雄心壮志  里库国王
I admire your lofty aspirations, King Ricou.

831
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:34,300
但是我怀疑
But I suspect

832
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:37,420
他们其实就只是一群懦夫而已
they are but clouds of ink hiding the heart of a coward.

833
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:39,960
岂有此理
How dare you!

834
01:24:41,830 --> 01:24:44,130
拜托了  我恳求你
Please. I implore you.

835
01:24:44,130 --> 01:24:47,930
你们国人都是傲慢的哲学家和软弱的诗人
You're a kingdom of bloated philosophers and flaccid poets

836
01:24:47,930 --> 01:24:51,470
你们的海水污浊不堪  这让我恶心
whose waters have grown stagnant, and it sickens me.

837
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,580
国王
My King!

838
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:05,350
国王已死  他的后嗣万岁
The king is dead! Long live his heir.

839
01:25:07,090 --> 01:25:08,320
公主
Princess.

840
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:12,930
请让你的军队做好准备  陛下
Prepare your armies, Your Highness.

841
01:25:12,930 --> 01:25:16,460
我们马上进攻咸水族王国
We move against the Brine Kingdom at once.

842
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:26,010
影像怎么说的来着
What did the recording say, again?

843
01:25:26,010 --> 01:25:28,970
"前往世界边缘之外的暗海
"Journey beyond the edge of the world to the Hidden Sea.

844
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:31,080
从瓶子里寻找航海路线
"Look in the bottle for the charted path.

845
01:25:31,490 --> 01:25:35,380
只有在真正的国王手中  才能真正看到"
"Only in the hands of the true king can he truly see."

846
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:40,050
"从瓶子里寻找航海路线"
"Look in the bottle for the charted path."

847
01:25:45,190 --> 01:25:46,730
天啊
Oh, man.

848
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:48,460
什么
What?

849
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:50,830
太棒了
Wow. That's awesome.

850
01:25:50,830 --> 01:25:52,000
给我看看
Let me see.

851
01:25:53,370 --> 01:25:55,570
但是要怎么知道往哪个方向看
Wow. But how do you know where to point it?

852
01:25:55,570 --> 01:25:57,100
给我看看
Here, let me see.

853
01:25:57,100 --> 01:25:58,800
最后一句是什么来着
What was the last line?

854
01:25:58,810 --> 01:26:02,270
"只有在真正的国王手中  才能真正看到"
"Only in the hands of the true king can he truly see."

855
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:04,010
"只有在真正的国王手中..."
"Only in the hands of the true..."

856
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:07,610
马尔库斯·阿格里帕
Marcus Agrippa.

857
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:09,580
他是位伟大的将军  但不是国王
He was a great general, but he wasn't a king.

858
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:12,950
大西庇阿也不是
Neither was Scipio.

859
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:15,920
这些东西你是怎么知道的
How do you know all this stuff?

860
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,020
因为我老爸  他把我的历史都教给我了
Because of my pops. He made sure I knew my history.

861
01:26:18,020 --> 01:26:24,330
这些人都不是国王  除了这个家伙  罗慕路斯
None of these guys are kings, except this guy. Romulus.

862
01:26:24,330 --> 01:26:26,370
罗马首任国王
First king of Rome.

863
01:26:28,430 --> 01:26:31,600
"只有在真正的国王手中  才能真正看到"
"Only in the hands of the true king can he truly see."

864
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:43,580
找到了  那就是我们的目的地
There it is. That's our heading.

865
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:45,550
什么  让我看看
What? Let me see.

866
01:26:47,790 --> 01:26:48,950
我们做到了
We did it!

867
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,890
我这个低能儿还不赖吧
That's not bad for an imbecile, huh?

868
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:57,600
很不赖
Not bad at all.

869
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:12,680
媚拉
Mera.

870
01:27:14,510 --> 01:27:20,350
"厌恶在深处等待并渴望
"Loathsomeness waits and dreams in the deep,

871
01:27:20,350 --> 01:27:25,630
腐朽遍布于人那摇摇欲坠的城市"
"And decay spreads over the tottering cities of men."

872
01:27:29,330 --> 01:27:30,560
退后
Get back!

873
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,170
亚瑟
Arthur!

874
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:41,770
我命令你们退下
I order you to stand down!

875
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:43,980
媚拉公主  你被指控以叛国罪
Princess Mera, you've been charged with high treason.

876
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:05,630
你是谁
Who the hell are you?

877
01:28:05,630 --> 01:28:07,830
这个或许能唤起你的记忆
Maybe this will jog your memory.

878
01:28:55,710 --> 01:28:57,880
你是潜艇上那个人
You're the guy from the sub.

879
01:28:57,880 --> 01:28:59,320
没错
That's right.

880
01:29:00,690 --> 01:29:03,120
但现在我有亚特兰蒂斯钢
But now I have Atlantean steel.

881
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,730
叫我"黑蝠鲼"
Call me "Black Manta."

882
01:29:26,810 --> 01:29:29,010
你以为你能逃得了吗
You thought you could walk away?

883
01:29:34,890 --> 01:29:36,790
我不是告诉过你不要把这当成习惯吗
I thought I told you not to make this a habit.

884
01:29:57,410 --> 01:29:58,710
你跑不了
You can't run.

885
01:29:59,510 --> 01:30:01,780
你要血债血偿
You owe me blood!

886
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:03,450
你怎么找到我的
How'd you find me?

887
01:30:03,450 --> 01:30:07,720
你这位女伴有几个想要盯住她的朋友
Your lady friend has people who like to keep tabs on her.

888
01:30:06,070 --> 01:30:08,060
目标锁定

889
01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:25,660
不
No!

890
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:01,070
快点
Come on.

891
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:07,570
大家都进去  进去
Everybody, inside. Get inside.

892
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:16,740
我会像你那么"仁慈"对待我父亲一样对待你
I'll show you the same mercy you showed my father.

893
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:19,580
把你像剖鱼一样剖开
And gut you like the fish you are!

894
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:53,880
系统故障

895
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:16,300
亚瑟
Arthur!

896
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:22,440
媚拉  他们在追踪你
Mera, they're tracking you.

897
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:23,570
什么
What?

898
01:34:23,570 --> 01:34:25,310
他们在追踪你
They're tracking you.

899
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:39,290
亚瑟  坚持住
Arthur, stay with me.

900
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:43,030
亚瑟  醒醒  亚瑟
Arthur, wake up! Arthur.

901
01:35:34,580 --> 01:35:36,210
你偷了一艘船吗
Did you steal a boat?

902
01:35:36,210 --> 01:35:39,350
码头的船不是公用的吗
Are the boats at the marina not for public use?

903
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:42,520
不是  那是个人的
No, those belong to people.

904
01:35:46,090 --> 01:35:47,820
那些人是奥姆的精锐先锋
Those were Orm's elite commandos.

905
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:51,120
但是带头的人  不是亚特兰蒂斯人
But the one who led them, he wasn't Atlantean.

906
01:35:51,130 --> 01:35:53,490
我以前从没见过他
I've never seen him before.

907
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:55,160
我见过
Yeah, I have.

908
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:57,670
他和他父亲是海盗
He and his father were pirates.

909
01:35:59,130 --> 01:36:01,700
他把他父亲的死怪在我头上
And he blames me for his father's death.

910
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:06,280
他们选择了一个危险的行业  不是你的错
They picked a dangerous line of trade. It's not your fault.

911
01:36:07,110 --> 01:36:09,040
但感觉不是这样的
That's not how it feels.

912
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:15,050
当时我能决定他的生死  而我让他死了
It was up to me, and I let him die.

913
01:36:15,050 --> 01:36:17,950
我本可以救他  但我没有
I could've saved him, but I didn't.

914
01:36:17,950 --> 01:36:21,920
所以我树敌了  他差点就伤到你
And now, I made an enemy, and he could have hurt you.

915
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,430
伤到你的话就是我的错
And that would have been my fault.

916
01:36:25,330 --> 01:36:27,430
他现在是过去时了
Well, he's behind us now.

917
01:36:28,660 --> 01:36:31,270
我们应该担心的是后面的事
It's what lies ahead that should concern us.

918
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:36,200
航海路线带我们去的是海沟国
The charted path leads to the Kingdom of the Trench.

919
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:40,270
就是他们杀害了我母亲  对吗
Are those the same creatures that killed my mother?

920
01:36:40,910 --> 01:36:42,270
对
Yes.

921
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:44,380
她被带去那里祭献给了他们
She was taken there and sacrificed to them.

922
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:46,550
那里已经变成了死亡之地
It's become a place of death.

923
01:36:46,550 --> 01:36:48,750
我们对那里有什么几乎一无所知
We know next to nothing about what's down there.

924
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:55,120
我们应该回头
We should turn back.

925
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:56,340
我们仍然有时间警告陆地人
We can still warn the surface.

926
01:36:56,340 --> 01:36:57,930
让他们做好准备  迎接即将到来的战争
Try and prepare them for what's coming.

927
01:36:57,930 --> 01:36:59,530
回头
Turn back?

928
01:36:59,530 --> 01:37:03,560
我从小就学会了不显露弱点
Look, I learned from a young age not to show weakness.

929
01:37:03,570 --> 01:37:06,800
知道吗  我用愤怒和拳头解决我的问题
Okay? I solve my problems with my anger and my fists.

930
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:09,800
我就是个粗人  我擅长武力解决问题
I'm a blunt instrument, and I'm damn good at it.

931
01:37:09,810 --> 01:37:14,270
但这一路下来  我就只有被揍的份
But I've done nothing but get my ass kicked this whole trip.

932
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:17,310
我不是领袖  不是国王
I'm no leader. I'm not a king.

933
01:37:17,310 --> 01:37:21,050
我不擅长跟别人合作或者相处
I do not work or play well with others.

934
01:37:21,050 --> 01:37:22,620
我不能让你
And I can't let you die

935
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:25,750
因为想把我变成我本就不是的那种人而死
trying to turn me into something that I'm not.

936
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:27,390
你觉得因为你是两个不同世界之人
You think you're unworthy to lead

937
01:37:27,390 --> 01:37:30,460
结合所生  所以你不配当领袖
because you're of two different worlds.

938
01:37:30,460 --> 01:37:33,590
但其实正因为如此  你才配
But that is exactly why you are worthy.

939
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:36,330
你是陆地和海洋之间的桥梁
You are the bridge between land and sea.

940
01:37:37,690 --> 01:37:38,940
现在我看得出来
I can see that now.

941
01:37:40,170 --> 01:37:41,670
唯一的问题是
The only question is...

942
01:37:44,410 --> 01:37:45,570
你能做到吗
Can you?

943
01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:04,660
目前还未能追踪到媚拉公主  陛下
The tracking on Lady Mera is still dark, Your Highness.

944
01:38:05,690 --> 01:38:07,160
维科
Vulko.

945
01:38:07,930 --> 01:38:09,800
我值得信赖的宰相
My trusted vizier

946
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:13,470
自从我父亲坐上王位起  就一直陪伴左右
who has stood by the throne since my father sat upon it.

947
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:18,440
战争即将打响  你有什么建议给我吗
Have you any advice for me as this war begins?

948
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:21,570
我已经给你了  国王
I have already given it, My King.

949
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:25,080
但我会一如既往地拥护你的决定
But I will stand by your decision, as always.

950
01:38:25,710 --> 01:38:27,250
我的决定
My decision.

951
01:38:29,220 --> 01:38:30,620
保护它
To protect it.

952
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:34,390
同时又背叛它
While you betray it.

953
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:39,090
你以为我不知道你的叛国行径吗
You think I do not know of your treachery?

954
01:38:39,090 --> 01:38:44,400
你仍效忠于我母亲的私生子
That you have remained loyal to my mother's bastard son.

955
01:38:44,850 --> 01:38:46,490
你用了多年时间
That you have spent years

956
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:49,840
来训练他夺走我的王位
training him to take the throne from me.

957
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:54,510
不要否认
Do not deny it.

958
01:38:57,650 --> 01:38:58,780
我没有
I do not.

959
01:38:59,380 --> 01:39:00,650
为什么
Why?

960
01:39:02,150 --> 01:39:05,020
我是血统纯正的继承人
I am the pureblood.

961
01:39:05,020 --> 01:39:08,050
我将毕生都献给了亚特兰蒂斯
I have devoted my life to Atlantis.

962
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:11,560
他根本不想与之有任何关系  你发誓效忠国王的
He wanted nothing to do with it. You swore to serve the throne!

963
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:12,560
我确实效忠了
I do serve it.

964
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:15,230
亚瑟虽然只是半个亚特兰蒂斯人
Arthur may only be half-Atlantean,

965
01:39:15,230 --> 01:39:19,370
但是他已经比你这个国王够格两倍了
but he's already twice the king you'll ever be.

966
01:39:25,670 --> 01:39:27,140
带他走
Take him.

967
01:39:28,340 --> 01:39:30,310
但是要确保他能看到
But make sure he has a view.

968
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:13,080
这些到底是什么鬼东西
What the hell are these things?

969
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:14,920
海沟族  我们到目的地了
The Trench! We're here!

970
01:41:17,450 --> 01:41:19,390
-他们太多了  -快进里面
- There are too many of them! - Come on, inside!

971
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:30,930
他们是从深海来的
They're from the depths.

972
01:41:30,930 --> 01:41:32,600
他们害怕光  给你
They're scared of the light. Here!

973
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:46,350
快来
Come on!

974
01:41:51,050 --> 01:41:52,420
你准备好跳了吗
You ready to jump?

975
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:02,960
那边
Over there!

976
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:06,850
海沟族

977
01:43:37,590 --> 01:43:39,590
那会把我们撕碎的
That thing will tear us apart.

978
01:43:39,590 --> 01:43:41,430
我们别无选择
We don't have a choice!

979
01:44:01,350 --> 01:44:03,050
亚瑟
Arthur!

980
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:07,520
媚拉
Mera!

981
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:39,820
媚拉
Mera!

982
01:44:40,950 --> 01:44:41,950
媚拉
Mera!

983
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:51,420
地心  暗海

984
01:45:03,610 --> 01:45:04,810
媚拉
Mera!

985
01:45:07,810 --> 01:45:08,810
媚拉
Mera!

986
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:54,230
亚瑟
Arthur.

987
01:45:55,130 --> 01:45:56,530
妈妈
Mom?

988
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:39,440
欧瓦克国王把我祭献给海沟族  但我活下来了
King Orvax sacrificed me to the Trench, but I survived.

989
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:42,900
我跟你一样一路奋战  最后到了这里
I fought my way through as you did, and I ended up here.

990
01:46:42,910 --> 01:46:44,740
你一个人在这里待了20年
You've been here alone for 20 years?

991
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:46,210
是的
Yes.

992
01:46:46,210 --> 01:46:47,710
来  在这里坐
Come. Sit here.

993
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:55,220
你一定要原谅我
You must forgive me.

994
01:46:55,220 --> 01:46:57,850
原谅我让这一切发生
Forgive me for everything.

995
01:46:57,860 --> 01:47:00,360
这一切都是因为你生了我
This happened because you had me.

996
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:05,230
不是因为生了你  没什么是你的错
Not for having you. None of this is your fault.

997
01:47:05,230 --> 01:47:08,130
是我做出了选择  我必须离开
I made a choice. I had to leave...

998
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:12,240
这样才能救你  才能救你父亲
To save you, to save your father.

999
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:17,210
告诉我  告诉我他的事
Tell me. Tell me about him.

1000
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:19,040
他...
Is he...

1001
01:47:22,810 --> 01:47:25,280
他还是会走到那个码头尽头
He still walks to the end of that dock.

1002
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:28,150
每天早上都是
Every morning.

1003
01:47:31,190 --> 01:47:32,660
每天都是
Every day.

1004
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:37,260
等着你
Waiting for you.

1005
01:47:44,870 --> 01:47:46,400
你为什么不回来
Why didn't you ever come back?

1006
01:47:51,940 --> 01:47:56,180
因为带你来这里的传送门不让我们回去
Because the portal that brought you here won't let us return.

1007
01:47:56,180 --> 01:47:59,810
三叉戟是回去的唯一方法
The trident is the only way back.

1008
01:47:59,820 --> 01:48:03,850
但是卡拉森在守护着它
But it is guarded by the Karathen.

1009
01:48:06,060 --> 01:48:08,620
传说中的怪物  是真实存在的
The creature from our legends, it's real.

1010
01:48:08,630 --> 01:48:11,760
它就在瀑布后面
It lies beyond the waterfall.

1011
01:48:15,830 --> 01:48:18,170
我们跟你一起去  我们可以一起战斗
We'll go with you. We can fight it together.

1012
01:48:18,170 --> 01:48:19,540
不
No.

1013
01:48:19,540 --> 01:48:21,370
它太强大了
It's too powerful.

1014
01:48:21,370 --> 01:48:25,210
多年来我试过很多次
I've tried many times over the years.

1015
01:48:25,210 --> 01:48:28,810
它只会允许真正的国王通过
The creature will only allow the true king to pass.

1016
01:48:31,710 --> 01:48:33,350
你害怕了
You're afraid.

1017
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:37,190
是的
Yes.

1018
01:48:38,690 --> 01:48:39,990
很好
Good.

1019
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:42,930
你准备好了
You're ready.

1020
01:48:44,190 --> 01:48:46,060
亚特兰蒂斯一直都有国王
Atlantis has always had a king.

1021
01:48:47,830 --> 01:48:50,030
现在它需要的不止如此
Now, it needs something more.

1022
01:48:50,030 --> 01:48:52,170
但是有什么比国王更伟大
But what could be greater than a king?

1023
01:48:52,670 --> 01:48:53,940
一个英雄
A hero.

1024
01:48:55,710 --> 01:48:58,110
国王只为自己的国家而战
A king fights only for his nation.

1025
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:02,150
而你为每个人而战
You fight for everyone.

1026
01:50:30,700 --> 01:50:36,470
你不属于这里
You do not belong here.

1027
01:50:36,470 --> 01:50:39,060
我自开始
I have guarded the trident

1028
01:50:39,060 --> 01:50:43,040
就守护三叉戟  击退伪王
against false kings since the beginning.

1029
01:50:43,050 --> 01:50:46,270
一千年来
And for a thousand years

1030
01:50:46,570 --> 01:50:51,250
我见证了最伟大的斗士来尝试并失败
I have seen the greatest champions try and fail.

1031
01:50:51,250 --> 01:50:57,790
但我从未感知到任何像你一样不够格的人
But never have I sensed one as unworthy as you.

1032
01:50:57,790 --> 01:51:05,030
你一个混血杂种  竟敢来此
You dare come here with your tainted mongrel blood

1033
01:51:05,030 --> 01:51:08,570
妄图拿到亚特兰蒂斯最伟大的宝藏
to claim Atlantis' greatest treasure?

1034
01:51:10,870 --> 01:51:12,110
那就来吧
So be it...

1035
01:51:13,510 --> 01:51:15,280
混血种
Half-breed.

1036
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:37,960
你以为自己有资格吗
You thought yourself worthy?

1037
01:51:37,970 --> 01:51:41,100
你以为自己是国王吗
You thought yourself a king?

1038
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:45,510
你来此就是让此地蒙羞
You dishonor this place with your presence.

1039
01:51:45,510 --> 01:51:46,610
停下
Stop!

1040
01:51:54,180 --> 01:51:58,850
你说得对  我是个混血杂种
You're right. I am a half-breed mongrel.

1041
01:51:58,850 --> 01:52:01,790
但我来此不是因为我觉得自己有资格
But I did not come here because I thought I was worthy.

1042
01:52:01,790 --> 01:52:03,690
我知道我没有
I know I'm not.

1043
01:52:03,690 --> 01:52:07,760
你理解我的话
You understand me?

1044
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:09,530
是的
I do.

1045
01:52:09,530 --> 01:52:16,340
亚特兰王去世后  就没人再能与我沟通了
No mortal has conversed with me since King Atlan.

1046
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:20,640
你是谁
Who are you?

1047
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:22,910
我是个无名小卒
I'm nobody.

1048
01:52:25,110 --> 01:52:27,980
我来这里是因为我别无选择
I came because I had no choice.

1049
01:52:29,450 --> 01:52:34,050
我来是为了救我的家园和我爱的人
I came to save my home and the people that I love.

1050
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:40,260
我来是因为三叉戟是他们唯一的希望
I came because the trident is their only hope.

1051
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:42,460
如果这个理由还不够的话...
And if that's not good enough...

1052
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:46,470
那你就去死吧
Then screw you.

1053
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:55,440
没人成功把三叉戟从亚特兰王的手中拿走过
No man has ever freed the trident from Atlan's grip.

1054
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:59,480
如果他认为你没资格...
Should he deem you unworthy...

1055
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:04,850
反正我很久没有吃过东西了
Well, I haven't feasted in eons,

1056
01:53:04,850 --> 01:53:08,060
我现在饿极了
and I am famished.

1057
01:54:37,950 --> 01:54:41,110
真正的国王
The one true king.

1058
01:54:53,460 --> 01:54:57,000
记住  咸水族是强大的野蛮之族
Remember, the Brine are powerful, savage brutes,

1059
01:54:57,430 --> 01:54:58,150
但是快速直接地
but a swift assault aimed

1060
01:54:58,150 --> 01:55:01,130
攻击他们的领袖  可以扭转局面
directly at their leadership will turn the tide.

1061
01:55:01,140 --> 01:55:02,970
打败咸水族国王
Defeat the Brine King,

1062
01:55:02,970 --> 01:55:06,640
你就能拥有这个星球上最强大的军队
and you will command the greatest military might on this planet.

1063
01:55:08,510 --> 01:55:10,510
今天  我们联合我们的王国
Today, we unite our kingdoms.

1064
01:55:12,180 --> 01:55:13,780
明天  我们将陆地夷为平地
Tomorrow, we scorch the surface!

1065
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:18,490
崛起吧  亚特兰蒂斯
Rise, Atlantis!

1066
01:55:36,140 --> 01:55:39,570
消灭亚特兰蒂斯那群丑鱼
Death to the Atlantean hagfish!

1067
01:55:36,140 --> 01:55:39,070
咸水族王国

1068
01:55:44,780 --> 01:55:47,080
我们绝不向亚特兰蒂斯屈膝
We will not bow to Atlantis.

1069
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:51,620
我们给他们一仗  让他们永生难忘
We're gonna give them a fight that they will never forget!

1070
01:56:58,050 --> 01:57:00,850
不  我们需要他
No! We need him!

1071
01:57:03,060 --> 01:57:04,660
顺者昌  逆者亡
Join me or die.

1072
01:57:04,660 --> 01:57:08,230
你想让我称你为陛下吗
You expect me to address you as Your Highness?

1073
01:57:08,230 --> 01:57:09,660
不是"陛下"
Not Your Highness.

1074
01:57:11,660 --> 01:57:13,230
叫我...
Call me...

1075
01:57:13,930 --> 01:57:15,630
海洋领主
Ocean Master.

1076
01:57:15,640 --> 01:57:19,540
尽管把我的军队带走吧  你个软腹鼻涕虫
You can take my army, you soft-bellied slug.

1077
01:57:19,540 --> 01:57:23,110
但你休想让我对你效忠
But you will never have my allegiance!

1078
01:57:23,110 --> 01:57:24,380
那就这样吧
So be it!

1079
01:57:56,240 --> 01:57:57,580
搞什么...
What the...

1080
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:34,610
真正的国王崛起了
The king has risen.

1081
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:44,390
进攻
Attack!

1082
02:00:43,140 --> 02:00:45,840
伤亡太多了  我们必须马上停止战斗
There are too many casualties. We have to stop the fighting now.

1083
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:49,180
我会找到我父亲  但你必须打败奥姆
I'll find my father. But you must defeat Orm.

1084
02:00:50,510 --> 02:00:52,080
如果我无法打败他呢
And what if I can't?

1085
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:55,320
上次是他占尽天时地利
Last time, he was in his element.

1086
02:00:55,320 --> 02:00:58,520
这次  让他尝尝你拥有天时地利时的厉害
This time, make him fight in yours.

1087
02:01:27,390 --> 02:01:30,650
-计划是什么来着  -计划是不要被杀死
- What was the plan, again? - The plan is to not get killed.

1088
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:34,490
好计划  别被杀死
Yeah, good plan. Don't get killed.

1089
02:02:07,420 --> 02:02:09,460
海沟族  他号令了海沟族
The Trench! He commands the Trench!

1090
02:02:09,460 --> 02:02:10,960
不可能
Impossible!

1091
02:02:27,810 --> 02:02:29,540
退下  让她通过
Stand down! Let her pass.

1092
02:02:29,550 --> 02:02:32,750
父亲  求你了  他有三叉戟
Please, Father, he has the trident.

1093
02:02:32,750 --> 02:02:35,120
我知道你认为这场战争没必要
I know you think this war is necessary,

1094
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:37,690
但按照我们最神圣的法典  亚瑟是国王
but Arthur is king by our most sacred law.

1095
02:02:37,690 --> 02:02:39,350
如果你现在无视那一点
And if you turn your back on that now,

1096
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:41,660
那你守卫的亚特兰蒂斯就已经死了
then the Atlantis you're fighting for is already dead.

1097
02:02:41,660 --> 02:02:42,780
是真的
It's true!

1098
02:02:42,790 --> 02:02:44,730
那个杂种挥着亚特兰王的三叉戟
The half-breed wields King Atlan's trident.

1099
02:02:44,730 --> 02:02:46,000
他号令了大海
He commands the sea!

1100
02:02:48,060 --> 02:02:50,130
那那个混血种就是你们的国王了
Then that half-breed is your king.

1101
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:09,780
维科  快来  他需要我们的帮助
Vulko! Come on, he needs our help!

1102
02:04:09,780 --> 02:04:11,680
我们不能去  你看
We can't! Look.

1103
02:04:11,680 --> 02:04:13,320
人民必须亲眼见证
The people must bear witness.

1104
02:04:19,460 --> 02:04:21,920
那把三叉戟不会改变你的出身
That trident doesn't change what you are.

1105
02:04:22,820 --> 02:04:24,360
你是个混血杂种
A half-breed bastard.

1106
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:30,300
亚特兰蒂斯永远不会接受你成为其国王
Atlantis will never accept you as its king.

1107
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:34,370
那浴血
Well, then by bloodshed...

1108
02:04:36,610 --> 02:04:38,640
方能明神意
Do the gods make known their will.

1109
02:05:08,070 --> 02:05:10,370
交出王位  交出来
Yield the throne. Yield it!

1110
02:06:46,200 --> 02:06:47,400
了结吧
Finish it.

1111
02:06:47,400 --> 02:06:48,770
交出王位
Yield the throne.

1112
02:06:48,770 --> 02:06:50,540
我们从不仁慈
Mercy is not our way.

1113
02:06:52,140 --> 02:06:54,280
你可能没注意到  弟弟
Maybe you haven't noticed, brother...

1114
02:06:59,750 --> 02:07:01,620
但我不是你们的一员
But I'm not one of you.

1115
02:07:01,620 --> 02:07:02,850
动手
Do it!

1116
02:07:05,090 --> 02:07:07,090
-杀了我  -不
- Kill me! - No!

1117
02:07:09,730 --> 02:07:11,430
杀戮已经够多了
That is enough killing.

1118
02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:20,270
母亲
Mother?

1119
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:22,470
我的儿子
Oh, my son.

1120
02:07:31,610 --> 02:07:33,750
说来话长了
It's a long story.

1121
02:07:33,750 --> 02:07:35,280
我晚点再告诉你
I'll tell ya later.

1122
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:37,520
来吧
Come on!

1123
02:07:44,060 --> 02:07:47,230
我不明白  我们以为...
I don't understand. We thought...

1124
02:07:47,230 --> 02:07:48,230
我知道
I know.

1125
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:50,600
亚瑟救了我
Arthur saved me.

1126
02:07:54,300 --> 02:07:56,570
-你支持他  -是的
- You're with him? - I am.

1127
02:07:59,140 --> 02:08:04,240
你们都是我的孩子  我非常爱你们
You're both my children, and I love you so much.

1128
02:08:04,240 --> 02:08:06,480
但你被误导了
But you have been misguided.

1129
02:08:07,850 --> 02:08:11,920
你父亲教你说有两个世界
Your father taught you that there were two worlds.

1130
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:13,790
但他错了
He was wrong.

1131
02:08:13,790 --> 02:08:16,520
陆地和海洋
The land and the sea

1132
02:08:17,830 --> 02:08:19,360
是一体的
are one.

1133
02:08:39,350 --> 02:08:40,480
我的王后
My queen.

1134
02:08:43,580 --> 02:08:44,950
维科
Vulko.

1135
02:08:47,250 --> 02:08:49,050
带他走
Take him.

1136
02:08:49,060 --> 02:08:51,390
但确保他能看到
But make sure he has a view.

1137
02:08:58,400 --> 02:08:59,400
等你准备好
When you're ready,

1138
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:03,200
我们聊聊
let's talk.

1139
02:09:17,850 --> 02:09:21,990
亚特兰蒂斯人民  今天以流血开始
People of Atlantis, today began in bloodshed,

1140
02:09:21,990 --> 02:09:24,960
但我们以喜悦结束吧
but let it end in joy.

1141
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:29,490
我为大家介绍亚特兰蒂斯亚瑟国王
I give you King Arthur of Atlantis.

1142
02:09:29,500 --> 02:09:31,200
国王万岁
Hail to the king!

1143
02:09:31,200 --> 02:09:34,230
-国王万岁  -国王万岁
- Hail to the king! - Hail to the king!

1144
02:09:42,280 --> 02:09:44,610
现在我该怎么做
So, what do I do now?

1145
02:09:45,210 --> 02:09:47,010
当他们的国王
Be their king.

1146
02:09:49,580 --> 02:09:51,690
肯定会很好玩
This is gonna be fun.

1147
02:10:43,700 --> 02:10:46,600
你回来了  你回来了
You came back. You're back.

1148
02:10:46,610 --> 02:10:48,710
是的  是的
Yes. Yes.

1149
02:10:54,580 --> 02:10:57,480
我父亲是个灯塔管理员

1150
02:10:58,290 --> 02:11:00,350
我母亲是个王后

1151
02:11:01,860 --> 02:11:03,620
他们不该相识...
They were never meant to meet...

1152
02:11:07,130 --> 02:11:09,530
但他们的爱拯救了世界
But their love saved the world.

1153
02:11:11,730 --> 02:11:14,330
他们造就了今天的我
They made me what I am.

1154
02:11:14,330 --> 02:11:18,040
陆地人的儿子  海洋的国王
A son of the land, and a king of the seas.

1155
02:11:19,610 --> 02:11:21,640
我是深海的保护者
I am the protector of the deep.

1156
02:11:23,440 --> 02:11:24,510
我是

1157
02:11:26,180 --> 02:11:28,150
海王
Aquaman.

1158
02:14:07,550 --> 02:14:14,530
海王

- Weren't you fired? - ...studying oceanic phenomenon,

1162
02:14:49,410 --> 02:14:51,780
这是目前为止最确凿的证据
and this is the most conclusive evidence we have to date.

1163
02:14:51,780 --> 02:14:52,940
深海地震仪
Deep-sea seismographs

1164
02:14:52,940 --> 02:14:55,350
记录到了海洋底部的爆炸

有卫星影像显示

对  政府不想让我们知道

1170

当前存在的威胁...

1171
02:15:08,300 --> 02:15:10,630
我不建议你那么做
Yeah, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1172
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:24,810
这是亚特兰蒂斯人的技术  是吗
This is Atlantean technology, isn't it?

1173
02:15:24,820 --> 02:15:26,950
你能告诉我你怎么得到这个的吗
