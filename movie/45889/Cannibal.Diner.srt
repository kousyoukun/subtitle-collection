1
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,251
"嘿，嘿，嘿......這是美林和吉爾在做他們最喜歡的工作."
"Hey, hey, hey... this is Mele and Jill doing
their favorite work, their calling. "

2
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,283
女孩們，這很適合你們，可比走秀好得多。你們應該開始擺幾個姿勢，或許能帶來野營所需的經費。
Girls, this suits you much better than the catwalk.
Maybe you should start advertising for camping requirements.

3
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,162
來吧，給我一個微笑......
Come on, give me a smile...

4
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,561
這可怕的天氣，是吧？
This is awesome weather, isn't it?

5
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,765
我們應拿一些......他媽的，現在我們要進行所有的野營準備。
We should have picked up some guys...
Now we have to carry all that shit on our own.

6
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,847
大麗花，你能放下攝像機幫助我們嗎？
Dahlia, would you put down the camera
and start helping us?

7
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,562
就現在。
Now.

8
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:23,130
你習慣了攝像機拍攝，別悲傷，如果你努力，就能成為你一生的事業。
You are used to cameras and again, don't cry
if you have to work hard for once in your lifetime.

9
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,524
停下。你不知道什麼才是攝像。
Stop it. You don't know what real work is like.

10
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,163
嗯，我們終於完成。接下來做什麼？
Well, we are finally done. What shall we do
until the others arrive?

11
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,687
酒在哪裡？
Where is the wine?

12
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,289
小吃在哪？我餓了...-大麗花，別吃太多。你的肚子不適合......
Where are the snacks? I'm getting hungry... -
Dahlia, stop eating so much. Your ass won't fit in...

13
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,164
嘿，嘿，讓我們開始我們的宴會 ！
Hey, hey, let's start the party!

14
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,083
沒有落在我身上，也不在攝像機上 ！
Not on me, not on the camera!

15
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,730
啊，好了，這成什麼樣子了。好吧，女孩。
Ah okay, that's what it looks like.
All right, girls.

16
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,931
想要一些嗎?
Do you want some, too?

17
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,642
那是什麼?
What was that?

18
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,402
這就是答案—好東西。
That was the answer to good shit.

19
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,483
我什麼也沒聽到。
I don't hear anything.

20
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,689
好像有什麼東西。
There is something.

21
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,281
在哪裡？
Where is it?

22
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,327
正站在灌木叢裡，盯著看我們。來吧，你這個愚蠢的笨蛋 ！這是私人聚會的地方 ！
They are standing in the bushes and staring.
Come out, you stupid fuckers! This is a private party here!

23
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,241
美林？美林，回來，我們離開。
Mele? Mele, come on, let's leave.

24
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,561
我沒看到什麼。
I don't see anything.

25
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,648
想要看奶子嗎？我會給你看 ！
Wanna see tits? I will get you some!

26
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,450
美林，回來，你不知道誰在那裡。
Mele, come on, you don't know who is out there.

27
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,482
回來！
Come back!

28
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,163
出來，他媽的混蛋 ！
Get out you fucking bastards!

29
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,444
媽的，又熄火了。
Damn, the engine died again.

30
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,480
太好了！現在怎麼辦？
Great! And now?

31
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,602
修好它嗎？
Repair?

32
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,410
我們拿出袋子。
Let's take out the bags.

33
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,406
我拿扳手。
Get me the wrench.

34
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,489
這件嗎？-是的。
This one? -
One moment.

35
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,962
嗨 sweew
Hey sweew-

36
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,168
嘿，怎麼樣了?
Hey, how is it going?

37
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,883
我們的車有一個小故障，但我們會準時到達。你怎麼樣了?
We've had a little break-down, but we will arrive
on time. What's up with you?

38
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,051
我現在已經完成了工作模型。這令人敬畏。我要告訴你，很快。
I have finished the model job now.
It was awesome. I need to tell you about that soon.

39
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,929
我在打扮，然後我會滿足你們。
I'm dressing myself up and then I will meet you guys later.

40
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,241
不是這個，另一個 ！我不認為你的小妹妹將會成為一個技工。
Not this one, the other one!
I don't think your little sister will become a mechanic.

41
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,088
嘿，別對她吝嗇。你能讓她聽電話嗎？
Hey, don't be mean to her.
Could you get her the phone for a second?

42
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,083
當然可以。
Sure.

43
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:51,889
喂？
Hello?

44
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,210
甜心生日快樂 ！你收到禮物了嗎?
Happy birthday sweety! Did you get the present?

45
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,003
是的。真是太好了。我很喜歡它。
Yes. It is very nice. I really like it.

46
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,362
我很抱歉昨天沒能去你那兒。但我們今天會給你慶祝，好嗎？
I'm sorry that I couldn't be there yesterday.
But we'll make it up today, okay?

47
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,282
哦，太棒了。酷斃了。
Oh, that's going to be awesome. Cool.

48
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,525
席琳？先不要告訴塔尼婭，好嗎？
And Celine? Do not put up with everything
Tanja says, okay?

49
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,009
不，我不會這樣做
No, I won't do that.

50
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,169
很好。回頭見。
Great. See you later.

51
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,651
再見。-好了，我修好了。過來收拾東西。
Bye. -
Okay, we are finished now. Come on and pack the stuff up.

52
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,768
操。
Fuck.

53
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,286
來吧，撿起來。
Come on, pick it up.

54
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,888
嘿，Celine，是我。我有一個問題。我失去了方向，我在荒郊野外。
Hey Celine, it's me. I have a problem. I lost myway
and I am in the middle of nowhere.

55
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,844
你告訴塔尼婭給我回電話？好的，謝謝你。
Could you tell Tanja to call me back?
Okay thanks, see you.

56
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,927
對不起？
Excuse me?

57
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,123
對不起，你能幫我嗎？
Excuse me, can you help me?

58
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,282
我失去了方向，我也不知道我在哪裡。你可以幫我嗎？
I lost myway and I have no idea where I am.
Can you help me?

59
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,171
你們城裡人...你看不懂簡單的地圖真是太愚蠢了。
You city slickers... you are too stupid to read a simple map.

60
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,961
你能不能幫我？
Can you help me or not?

61
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,805
當然可以。
Yes, sure.

62
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,409
我也不知道您打算去哪裡，但你在這裡是錯了。
Well, I have no idea where you are planning to go to,
but you are wrong here.

63
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,449
該死 ！現在怎麼辦？
Damn! And now?

64
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,486
聽著，好嗎?你回頭看，開車去那邊一條道？
Listen, okay? You turn around and drive back
to the crossroadspkay?

65
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,323
到那裡你右轉，然後直走繼續開車。
And there you turn right and then keep driving straight ahead.

66
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,566
你將開車經過禁區。
You will get to a restricted area where you just drive through.

67
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,122
禁區？
Restricted area?

68
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,728
明白了？要開車穿過禁區。
Got it? Just drive through the restricted area.

69
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,927
你說的是什麼？
What are you talking about?

70
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,163
那是一家污染多年來的工廠。
The factories. They contaminated everything over the years.

71
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:56,411
但有一個工廠...一個...以前在那兒發生化學品事故。
But there was one factory... one...
where they had accidents with chemicals and stuff all the time.

72
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:04,963
有人說，員工瘋了，是因為化學氣體導致的。
Some say, that the employees went nuts because of
vapors and killed themselves in the end.

73
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,527
好
Okay"-

74
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:14,122
像你這種可愛的小東西應該迅速開車穿過那個地方。
And such a sweet little thing like you should
drive through that place quickly.

75
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,408
所以當你通過時，應該做個深呼吸。
So you guys should take a deep breath when you pass through.

76
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,642
什麼樣的傢伙？
What guys?

77
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,048
那輛車上是你的朋友嗎？
You and your friend in that car?

78
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:24,924
什麼？
What?

79
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,683
嘿 ！
Hey!

80
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,081
他媽的 ！混蛋 ！
Fuck! Asshole!

81
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,766
我們到了。
So here we are.

82
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,241
這是在哪裡？
And this is the location?

83
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,007
你看到在那裡的女孩們的帳篷。來吧，我們稍後把行李取下來。
Sure, you can see the girls' tents over there.
Come on, we will get the bags later.

84
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,164
來吧！
Come on!

85
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,842
來...
Coming...

86
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,884
女孩 ！在哪裡？
Girls! Where are you?

87
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,371
你確定是這地方？
Are you sure this is the right place?

88
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,000
肯定是的。這些都是他們的帳篷。
Of course. These are their tents.

89
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,009
媽的，肯定是的，他們還在這裡。
Damn sure, they were here.

90
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,525
好吧，我沒看到這裡有任何人。
Well, I don't see anyone here.

91
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,049
禁區，污染危險，不能進入
RESTRICTED AREA RISK OF
CONTAMINATION DO NOT ENTER

92
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,048
等等。
Wait.

93
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,042
有鈴聲。
It's ringing.

94
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,721
美林的手機。
It's Mele's cell phone.

95
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,410
她去哪兒了呢？
Why did she leave it here?

96
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,684
喂？
Hello?

97
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,361
有人嗎?
Is someone here?

98
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,487
我打電話給卡蒂。
I call Kati.

99
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,769
卡蒂？喂？
Kati? Hello?

100
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,762
發生了什麼事？
What happened?

101
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,362
我不知道。
I don't know.

102
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,403
該死的。-拜託，別出什麼事。
Damn. -
Come on, there is something wrong.

103
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,086
有人嗎？
Hello?

104
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,367
媽的。
Shit.

105
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,685
你看，那邊有張地圖。
Look, the map over there.

106
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,804
這是卡蒂的地圖。
That is Kati's map.

107
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,204
真的嗎？-是的，她來過這裡。來吧，我們看一看。
Really? - Yes, she must have been here before.
Come on, let's have a look.

108
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,202
她為什麼會孤自去樹林裡?-我不知道。我們找找。
But why would she go in the woods alone?-
I have no clue. Let's check it out.

109
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,122
卡蒂？
Kati?

110
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,244
卡蒂，你在哪裡嗎？
Kati, where are you?

111
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,242
有人嗎？
Hello?

112
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,762
卡蒂？
Kati?

113
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,282
那是什麼？
What's that?

114
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,209
他媽的 ！
Fuck!

115
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,281
這不是真的。為什麼鎖住了門？
That can't be true. Why is everything locked?

116
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,007
媽的!
Nu!

116
00:26:26,120 --> 00:27:00,007
校對：飄走JWL(QQ：864231348)


117
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,967
他媽的。
Shit.

118
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,084
媽的!
Fuck it!

119
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,448
他媽的。
Shit.

120
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,007
卡蒂！
Kati!

121
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,647
卡蒂！
Kati!

122
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,371
我累了。
I'm tired.

123
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,202
聽著，我們已經在附近走了幾個小時，我想她不在這裡。
Listen, we've been walking around for hours
and I don't think she's here.

124
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,767
我覺得她在這裡的某個地方，這樣吧，
我們分頭去找可能更快地找到她，這是最好的辦法。
Well, I think she's here somewhere.
It would be the best if we split up to find her quicker.

125
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:11,731
我們不能分開找！我怕會像在那些恐怖片裡的事情要發生。
We can't split up! Hello, it's just like
in all those scary movies... something will happen.

126
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,447
別這樣懦弱，你是一個成年人 ！你走這條路我走那條路，在五分鐘後我們在這裡見面。
Don't be such a coward, you're an adult! You go this way,
I go that way and in five minutes we meet up again right here.

127
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,649
如果發生什麼事，你可以叫我。
You can call me if something happens.

128
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,481
卡蒂！
Kati!

129
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,245
該死的森林 ！
