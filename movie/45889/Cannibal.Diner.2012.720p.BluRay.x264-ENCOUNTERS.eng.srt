1
00:00:06,345 --> 00:00:31,673


2
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,356
"Hey, hey, hey... this is Mele and Jill doing
their favorite work, their calling. "

3
00:00:48,762 --> 00:00:54,646
Girls, this suits you much better than the catwalk.
Maybe you should start advertising for camping requirements.

4
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:57,648
Come on, give me a smile...

5
00:01:00,857 --> 00:01:03,277
This is awesome weather, isn't it?

6
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:08,703
We should have picked up some guys...
Now we have to carry all that shit on our own.

7
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:12,960
Dahlia, would you put down the camera
and start helping us?

8
00:01:14,913 --> 00:01:15,790
Now.

9
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:26,810
You are used to cameras and again, don't cry
if you have to work hard for once in your lifetime.

10
00:01:27,384 --> 00:01:30,349
Stop it. You don't know what real work is like.

11
00:02:12,304 --> 00:02:16,895
Well, we are finally done. What shall we do
until the others arrive?

12
00:02:17,476 --> 00:02:18,484
Where is the wine?

13
00:02:18,643 --> 00:02:23,282
Where are the snacks? I'm getting hungry... -
Dahlia, stop eating so much. Your ass won't fit in...

14
00:02:23,398 --> 00:02:25,237
Hey, hey, let's start the party!

15
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,324
Not on me, not on the camera!

16
00:02:59,768 --> 00:03:05,450
Ah okay, that's what it looks like.
All right, girls.

17
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:08,788
Do you want some, too?

18
00:03:09,694 --> 00:03:10,571
What was that?

19
00:03:11,363 --> 00:03:13,450
That was the answer to good shit.

20
00:03:16,993 --> 00:03:17,705
I don't hear anything.

21
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:20,005
There is something.

22
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:24,794
Where is it?

23
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:30,055
They are standing in the bushes and staring.
Come out, you stupid fuckers! This is a private party here!

24
00:03:30,674 --> 00:03:33,094
Mele? Mele, come on, let's leave.

25
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:34,470
I don't see anything.

26
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:36,646
Wanna see tits? I will get you some!

27
00:03:36,805 --> 00:03:38,525
Mele, come on, you don't know who is out there.

28
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,601
Come back!

29
00:03:40,475 --> 00:03:42,396
Get out you fucking bastards!

30
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:20,704
Damn, the engine died again.

31
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:22,826
Great! And now?

32
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:23,996
Repair?

33
00:05:42,055 --> 00:05:43,608
Let's take out the bags.

34
00:06:03,284 --> 00:06:04,458
Get me the wrench.

35
00:06:34,024 --> 00:06:35,826
This one? -
One moment.

36
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:41,533
Hey sweew-

37
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:43,833
Hey, how is it going?

38
00:06:44,075 --> 00:06:48,749
We've had a little break-down, but we will arrive
on time. What's up with you?

39
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,095
I have finished the model job now.
It was awesome. I need to tell you about that soon.

40
00:06:53,793 --> 00:06:57,139
I'm dressing myself up and then I will meet you guys later.

41
00:06:57,756 --> 00:07:01,635
Not this one, the other one!
I don't think your little sister will become a mechanic.

42
00:07:02,135 --> 00:07:05,646
Hey, don't be mean to her.
Could you get her the phone for a second?

43
00:07:06,055 --> 00:07:06,683
Sure.

44
00:07:09,017 --> 00:07:09,610
Hello?

45
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:14,115
Happy birthday sweety! Did you get the present?

46
00:07:14,856 --> 00:07:18,070
Yes. It is very nice. I really like it.

47
00:07:19,068 --> 00:07:22,615
I'm sorry that I couldn't be there yesterday.
But we'll make it up today, okay?

48
00:07:23,072 --> 00:07:26,702
Oh, that's going to be awesome. Cool.

49
00:07:27,285 --> 00:07:30,084
And Celine? Do not put up with everything
Tanja says, okay?

50
00:07:30,371 --> 00:07:33,717
No, I won't do that.

51
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,969
Great. See you later.

52
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:40,643
Bye. -
Okay, we are finished now. Come on and pack the stuff up.

53
00:09:15,852 --> 00:09:16,694
Fuck.

54
00:09:30,491 --> 00:09:31,831
Come on, pick it up.

55
00:09:46,341 --> 00:09:51,229
Hey Celine, it's me. I have a problem. I lost myway
and I am in the middle of nowhere.

56
00:09:52,055 --> 00:09:56,396
Could you tell Tanja to call me back?
Okay thanks, see you.

57
00:10:04,942 --> 00:10:05,866
Excuse me?

58
00:10:13,451 --> 00:10:15,456
Excuse me, can you help me?

59
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,963
I lost myway and I have no idea where I am.
Can you help me?

60
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:29,061
You city slickers... you are too stupid to read a simple map.

61
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:31,970
Can you help me or not?

62
00:10:32,303 --> 00:10:33,893
Yes, sure.

63
00:10:38,393 --> 00:10:42,865
Well, I have no idea where you are planning to go to,
but you are wrong here.

64
00:10:43,815 --> 00:10:47,077
Damn! And now?

65
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:53,372
Listen, okay? You turn around and drive back
to the crossroadspkay?

66
00:10:54,158 --> 00:10:57,372
And there you turn right and then keep driving straight ahead.

67
00:10:57,954 --> 00:11:01,797
You will get to a restricted area where you just drive through.

68
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,419
Restricted area?

69
00:11:04,544 --> 00:11:09,265
Got it? Just drive through the restricted area.

70
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,514
What are you talking about?

71
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:15,975
The factories. They contaminated everything over the years.

72
00:11:16,472 --> 00:11:24,574
But there was one factory... one...
where they had accidents with chemicals and stuff all the time.

73
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:33,492
Some say, that the employees went nuts because of
vapors and killed themselves in the end.

74
00:11:34,031 --> 00:11:35,122
Okay"-

75
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:43,042
And such a sweet little thing like you should
drive through that place quickly.

76
00:11:45,042 --> 00:11:48,553
So you guys should take a deep breath when you pass through.

77
00:11:50,006 --> 00:11:50,883
What guys?

78
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,392
You and your friend in that car?

79
00:11:53,926 --> 00:11:54,305
What?

80
00:11:55,428 --> 00:11:56,140
Hey!

81
00:12:17,074 --> 00:12:19,494
Fuck! Asshole!

82
00:15:23,594 --> 00:15:24,768
So here we are.

83
00:15:26,138 --> 00:15:27,348
And this is the location?

84
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:31,275
Sure, you can see the girls' tents over there.
Come on, we will get the bags later.

85
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:39,780
Come on!

86
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:41,530
Coming...

87
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,129
Girls! Where are you?

88
00:15:56,252 --> 00:15:57,723
Are you sure this is the right place?

89
00:15:58,128 --> 00:15:59,420
Of course. These are their tents.

90
00:16:00,756 --> 00:16:02,558
Damn sure, they were here.

91
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,182
Well, I don't see anyone here.

92
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:25,540
RESTRICTED AREA RISK OF
CONTAMINATION DO NOT ENTER

93
00:16:42,506 --> 00:16:43,265
Wait.

94
00:16:48,637 --> 00:16:49,514
It's ringing.

95
00:16:57,354 --> 00:16:58,564
It's Mele's cell phone.

96
00:16:59,815 --> 00:17:01,368
Why did she leave it here?

97
00:17:32,473 --> 00:17:32,935
Hello?

98
00:17:36,685 --> 00:17:37,812
Is someone here?

99
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:51,498
I call Kati.

100
00:18:13,972 --> 00:18:15,774
Kati? Hello?

101
00:18:16,975 --> 00:18:17,852
What happened?

102
00:18:18,727 --> 00:18:19,521
I don't know.

103
00:18:19,728 --> 00:18:21,649
Damn. -
Come on, there is something wrong.

104
00:19:09,069 --> 00:19:10,326
Hello?

105
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:00,103
Shit.

106
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:50,962
Look, the map over there.

107
00:22:59,841 --> 00:23:01,513
That is Kati's map.

108
00:23:01,676 --> 00:23:06,101
Really? - Yes, she must have been here before.
Come on, let's have a look.

109
00:23:06,723 --> 00:23:10,270
But why would she go in the woods alone?-
I have no clue. Let's check it out.

110
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:21,656
Kati?

111
00:23:25,325 --> 00:23:26,997
Kati, where are you?

112
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,080
Hello?

113
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,707
Kati?

114
00:25:23,985 --> 00:25:24,862
What's that?

115
00:25:35,663 --> 00:25:36,256
Fuck!

116
00:25:58,853 --> 00:26:01,356
That can't be true. Why is everything locked?

117
00:26:31,427 --> 00:26:32,351
Nu!

118
00:27:33,990 --> 00:28:09,324


119
00:31:18,047 --> 00:31:19,055
Shit.

120
00:31:30,184 --> 00:31:30,646
Fuck it!

121
00:31:40,695 --> 00:31:41,454
Shit.

122
00:31:55,626 --> 00:31:56,634
Kati!

123
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,558
Kati!

124
00:32:12,226 --> 00:32:13,697
I'm tired.

125
00:32:15,187 --> 00:32:18,734
Listen, we've been walking around for hours
and I don't think she's here.

126
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:24,537
Well, I think she's here somewhere.
It would be the best if we split up to find her quicker.

127
00:32:25,072 --> 00:32:31,798
We can't split up! Hello, it's just like
in all those scary movies... something will happen.

128
00:32:32,621 --> 00:32:37,758
Don't be such a coward, you're an adult! You go this way,
I go that way and in five minutes we meet up again right here.

129
00:32:38,252 --> 00:32:40,054
You can call me if something happens.

130
00:32:57,605 --> 00:32:58,648
Kati!

131
00:33:05,154 --> 00:33:06,744
God damn forest!

132
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:09,242
Kati!

133
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:17,842
Kati?

134
00:33:20,795 --> 00:33:22,597
Celine, is that you?

135
00:33:29,678 --> 00:33:30,390
Kati?

136
00:33:47,363 --> 00:33:51,420
Kati? Where are you?

137
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:45,798
I'm not scared... Shit!

138
00:35:07,276 --> 00:35:07,785
Tanja!

139
00:35:08,569 --> 00:35:09,281
Tanja!

140
00:35:11,655 --> 00:35:12,449
Tanja!

141
00:35:28,422 --> 00:35:29,596
Tanja!

142
00:35:41,602 --> 00:35:43,404
I need to hurry up, I need to get away!

143
00:41:08,136 --> 00:41:08,812
Fuck!

144
00:41:17,104 --> 00:41:17,780
Fuck!

145
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:39,125
Dammit...

146
00:43:16,806 --> 00:43:17,730
What's this?

147
00:43:28,026 --> 00:43:29,366
What do you want?

148
00:44:24,874 --> 00:44:25,502
Make'.!

149
00:44:32,132 --> 00:44:33,093
Oh God!

150
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:24,143
Make'.!

151
00:46:00,011 --> 00:46:01,932
Are you our new mommy?

152
00:46:02,222 --> 00:46:03,016
What?

153
00:46:04,474 --> 00:46:07,273
You are our new mommy, aren't you?

154
00:46:07,977 --> 00:46:11,405
No, I'm not your new mommy.

155
00:46:11,898 --> 00:46:15,244
You are our new mommy, 'till the next one arrives!

156
00:48:19,692 --> 00:48:21,032
Let mg go!

157
00:49:04,821 --> 00:49:08,534
Hands off me, you bastard!

158
01:00:11,403 --> 01:00:12,327
Fuck!

159
01:01:36,321 --> 01:01:37,115
Hey-

160
01:01:41,326 --> 01:01:42,963
I've got something better for you.

161
01:01:44,454 --> 01:01:50,136
I guess you have never seen a sexy girl like me
naked in front of your camera, right?

162
01:02:38,633 --> 01:02:39,178
Hey!

163
01:02:40,135 --> 01:02:41,309
The show is over!

164
01:02:48,268 --> 01:02:49,276
Motherfucker.

165
01:02:50,312 --> 01:02:52,114
How do I turn this thing on?

01:04:36,751 --> 01:04:37,759
...not! Damn!

167
01:04:40,713 --> 01:04:42,634
Why is there no exit?

168
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,475
Where is the exit?

169
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,475
