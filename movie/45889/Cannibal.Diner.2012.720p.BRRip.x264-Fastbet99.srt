1
00:00:42,711 --> 00:00:48,228
"嘿，嘿，嘿......这是美林和吉尔在做他们最喜欢的工作."
"Hey, hey, hey... this is Mele and Jill doing
their favorite work, their calling. "

2
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:54,518
女孩们，这很适合你们，可比走秀好得多。你们应该开始摆几个姿势，或许能带来野营所需的经费。
Girls, this suits you much better than the catwalk.
Maybe you should start advertising for camping requirements.

3
00:00:55,432 --> 00:00:57,520
来吧，给我一个微笑......
Come on, give me a smile...

4
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:03,150
这可怕的天气，是吧？
This is awesome weather, isn't it?

5
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:08,576
我们应拿一些......他妈的，现在我们要进行所有的野营准备。
We should have picked up some guys...
Now we have to carry all that shit on our own.

6
00:01:09,238 --> 00:01:12,833
大丽花，你能放下摄像机帮助我们吗？
Dahlia, would you put down the camera
and start helping us?

7
00:01:14,786 --> 00:01:15,664
就现在。
Now.

8
00:01:19,624 --> 00:01:26,684
你习惯了摄像机拍摄，别悲伤，如果你努力，就能成为你一生的事业。
You are used to cameras and again, don't cry
if you have to work hard for once in your lifetime.

9
00:01:27,257 --> 00:01:30,223
停下。你不知道什么才是摄像。
Stop it. You don't know what real work is like.

10
00:02:12,179 --> 00:02:16,770
嗯，我们终于完成。接下来做什么？
Well, we are finally done. What shall we do
until the others arrive?

11
00:02:17,351 --> 00:02:18,359
酒在哪里？
Where is the wine?

12
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:23,158
小吃在哪？我饿了...-大丽花，别吃太多。你的肚子不适合......
Where are the snacks? I'm getting hungry... -
Dahlia, stop eating so much. Your ass won't fit in...

13
00:02:23,274 --> 00:02:25,113
嘿，嘿，让我们开始我们的宴会 ！
Hey, hey, let's start the party!

14
00:02:27,194 --> 00:02:29,200
没有落在我身上，也不在摄像机上 ！
Not on me, not on the camera!

15
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:05,328
啊，好了，这成什么样子了。好吧，女孩。
Ah okay, that's what it looks like.
All right, girls.

16
00:03:07,194 --> 00:03:08,666
想要一些吗?
Do you want some, too?

17
00:03:09,572 --> 00:03:10,450
那是什么?
What was that?

18
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,328
这就是答案----好东西。
That was the answer to good shit.

19
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:17,583
我什么也没听到。
I don't hear anything.

20
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:19,884
好像有什么东西。
There is something.

21
00:03:23,545 --> 00:03:24,672
在哪里？
Where is it?

22
00:03:24,796 --> 00:03:29,934
正站在灌木丛里，盯着看我们。来吧，你这个愚蠢的笨蛋 ！这是私人聚会的地方 ！
They are standing in the bushes and staring.
Come out, you stupid fuckers! This is a private party here!

23
00:03:30,552 --> 00:03:32,972
美林？美林，回来，我们离开。
Mele? Mele, come on, let's leave.

24
00:03:33,305 --> 00:03:34,349
我没看到什么。
I don't see anything.

25
00:03:34,473 --> 00:03:36,525
想要看奶子吗？我会给你看 ！
Wanna see tits? I will get you some!

26
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:38,404
美林，回来，你不知道谁在那里。
Mele, come on, you don't know who is out there.

27
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:39,480
回来！
Come back!

28
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:42,276
出来，他妈的混蛋 ！
Get out you fucking bastards!

29
00:05:18,832 --> 00:05:20,588
妈的，又熄火了。
Damn, the engine died again.

30
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:22,711
太好了！现在怎么办？
Great! And now?

31
00:05:23,003 --> 00:05:23,881
修好它吗？
Repair?

32
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:43,493
我们拿出袋子。
Let's take out the bags.

33
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:04,344
我拿扳手。
Get me the wrench.

34
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,713
这件吗？-是的。
This one? -
One moment.

35
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:41,420
嗨 sweew
Hey sweew-

36
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,720
嘿，怎么样了?
Hey, how is it going?

37
00:06:43,962 --> 00:06:48,637
我们的车有一个小故障，但我们会准时到达。你怎么样了?
We've had a little break-down, but we will arrive
on time. What's up with you?

38
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:52,983
我现在已经完成了工作模型。这令人敬畏。我要告诉你，很快。
I have finished the model job now.
It was awesome. I need to tell you about that soon.

39
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,027
我在打扮，然后我会满足你们。
I'm dressing myself up and then I will meet you guys later.

40
00:06:57,643 --> 00:07:01,523
不是这个，另一个 ！我不认为你的小妹妹将会成为一个技工。
Not this one, the other one!
I don't think your little sister will become a mechanic.

41
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:05,534
嘿，别对她吝啬。你能让她听电话吗？
Hey, don't be mean to her.
Could you get her the phone for a second?

42
00:07:05,943 --> 00:07:06,572
当然可以。
Sure.

43
00:07:08,905 --> 00:07:09,498
喂？
Hello?

44
00:07:09,781 --> 00:07:14,004
甜心生日快乐 ！你收到礼物了吗?
Happy birthday sweety! Did you get the present?

45
00:07:14,744 --> 00:07:17,959
是的。真是太好了。我很喜欢它。
Yes. It is very nice. I really like it.

46
00:07:18,957 --> 00:07:22,504
我很抱歉昨天没能去你那儿。但我们今天会给你庆祝，好吗？
I'm sorry that I couldn't be there yesterday.
But we'll make it up today, okay?

47
00:07:22,961 --> 00:07:26,592
哦，太棒了。酷毙了。
Oh, that's going to be awesome. Cool.

48
00:07:27,174 --> 00:07:29,973
席琳？先不要告诉塔尼娅，好吗？
And Celine? Do not put up with everything
Tanja says, okay?

49
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,606
不，我不会这样做
No, I won't do that.

50
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:35,859
很好。回头见。
Great. See you later.

51
00:07:36,475 --> 00:07:40,532
再见。-好了，我修好了。过来收拾东西。
Bye. -
Okay, we are finished now. Come on and pack the stuff up.

52
00:09:15,745 --> 00:09:16,588
操。
Fuck.

53
00:09:30,385 --> 00:09:31,726
来吧，捡起来。
Come on, pick it up.

54
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:51,124
嘿，Celine，是我。我有一个问题。我迷失了方向，我在荒郊野外。
Hey Celine, it's me. I have a problem. I lost myway
and I am in the middle of nowhere.

55
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:56,291
你告诉塔尼娅给我回电话？好的，谢谢你。
Could you tell Tanja to call me back?
Okay thanks, see you.

56
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:05,763
对不起？
Excuse me?

57
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:15,352
对不起，你能帮我吗？
Excuse me, can you help me?

58
00:10:20,229 --> 00:10:23,860
我失去了方向，我也不知道我在哪里。你可以帮我吗？
I lost myway and I have no idea where I am.
Can you help me?

59
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,958
你们城里人...你看不懂简单的地图真是太愚蠢了。
You city slickers... you are too stupid to read a simple map.

60
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,867
你能不能帮我？
Can you help me or not?

61
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,790
当然可以。
Yes, sure.

62
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:42,762
我也不知道您打算去哪里，但你在这里是错了。
Well, I have no idea where you are planning to go to,
but you are wrong here.

63
00:10:43,712 --> 00:10:46,974
该死 ！现在怎么办？
Damn! And now?

64
00:10:47,966 --> 00:10:53,270
听着，好吗?你回头看，开车去那边一条道？
Listen, okay? You turn around and drive back
to the crossroadspkay?

65
00:10:54,056 --> 00:10:57,271
到那里你右转，然后直走继续开车。
And there you turn right and then keep driving straight ahead.

66
00:10:57,851 --> 00:11:01,695
你将开车经过禁区。
You will get to a restricted area where you just drive through.

67
00:11:02,356 --> 00:11:03,318
禁区？
Restricted area?

68
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:09,163
明白了？要开车穿过禁区。
Got it? Just drive through the restricted area.

69
00:11:09,489 --> 00:11:10,413
你说的是什么？
What are you talking about?

70
00:11:11,282 --> 00:11:15,873
那是一家污染多年来的工厂。
The factories. They contaminated everything over the years.

71
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:24,474
但有一个工厂...一个...以前在那儿发生化学品事故。
But there was one factory... one...
where they had accidents with chemicals and stuff all the time.

72
00:11:26,047 --> 00:11:33,392
有人说，员工疯了，是因为化学气体导致的。
Some say, that the employees went nuts because of
vapors and killed themselves in the end.

73
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:35,022
好
Okay"-

74
00:11:35,432 --> 00:11:42,942
像你这种可爱的小东西应该迅速开车穿过那个地方。
And such a sweet little thing like you should
drive through that place quickly.

75
00:11:44,942 --> 00:11:48,454
所以当你通过时，应该做个深呼吸。
So you guys should take a deep breath when you pass through.

76
00:11:49,906 --> 00:11:50,784
什么样的家伙？
What guys?

77
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,293
那辆车上是你的朋友吗？
You and your friend in that car?

78
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:54,206
什么？
What?

79
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:56,040
嘿 ！
Hey!

80
00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:19,396
他妈的 ！混蛋 ！
Fuck! Asshole!

81
00:15:23,503 --> 00:15:24,677
我们到了。
So here we are.

82
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:27,258
这是在哪里？
And this is the location?

83
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:31,185
你看到在那里的女孩们的帐篷。来吧，我们稍后把行李取下来。
Sure, you can see the girls' tents over there.
Come on, we will get the bags later.

84
00:15:39,228 --> 00:15:39,691
来吧！
Come on!

85
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:41,441
来...
Coming...

86
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:55,040
女孩 ！在哪里？
Girls! Where are you?

87
00:15:56,162 --> 00:15:57,633
你确定是这地方？
Are you sure this is the right place?

88
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,332
肯定是的。这些都是他们的帐篷。
Of course. These are their tents.

89
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,470
妈的，肯定是的，他们还在这里。
Damn sure, they were here.

90
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,093
好吧，我没看到这里有任何人。
Well, I don't see anyone here.

91
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:25,452
禁区，污染危险，不能进入
RESTRICTED AREA RISK OF
CONTAMINATION DO NOT ENTER

92
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,178
等等。
Wait.

93
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,428
有铃声。
It's ringing.

94
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,478
美林的手机。
It's Mele's cell phone.

95
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:01,282
她去哪儿了呢？
Why did she leave it here?

96
00:17:32,387 --> 00:17:32,850
喂？
Hello?

97
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,727
有人吗?
Is someone here?

98
00:17:50,323 --> 00:17:51,415
我打电话给卡蒂。
I call Kati.

99
00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:15,692
卡蒂？喂？
Kati? Hello?

100
00:18:16,892 --> 00:18:17,770
发生了什么事？
What happened?

101
00:18:18,644 --> 00:18:19,438
我不知道。
I don't know.

102
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:21,567
该死的。-拜托，别出什么事。
Damn. -
Come on, there is something wrong.

103
00:19:08,988 --> 00:19:10,246
有人吗？
Hello?

104
00:20:59,103 --> 00:21:00,028
妈的。
Shit.

105
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:50,891
你看，那边有张地图。
Look, the map over there.

106
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,443
这是卡蒂的地图。
That is Kati's map.

107
00:23:01,605 --> 00:23:06,031
真的吗？-是的，她来过这里。来吧，我们看一看。
Really? - Yes, she must have been here before.
Come on, let's have a look.

108
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:10,200
她为什么会孤自去树林里?-我不知道。我们找找。
But why would she go in the woods alone?-
I have no clue. Let's check it out.

109
00:23:20,709 --> 00:23:21,587
卡蒂？
Kati?

110
00:23:25,255 --> 00:23:26,928
卡蒂，你在哪里吗？
Kati, where are you?

111
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,011
有人吗？
Hello?

112
00:23:30,761 --> 00:23:31,639
卡蒂？
Kati?

113
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,798
那是什么？
What's that?

114
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:36,192
他妈的 ！
Fuck!

115
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,294
这不是真的。为什么锁住了门？
That can't be true. Why is everything locked?

116
00:26:31,366 --> 00:26:32,290
妈的!
Nu!

117
00:31:17,997 --> 00:31:19,006
他妈的。
Shit.

118
00:31:30,135 --> 00:31:30,598
妈的!
Fuck it!

119
00:31:40,646 --> 00:31:41,405
他妈的。
Shit.

120
00:31:55,578 --> 00:31:56,587
卡蒂！
Kati!

121
00:32:02,502 --> 00:32:03,510
卡蒂！
Kati!

122
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:13,650
我累了。
I'm tired.

123
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,688
听着，我们已经在附近走了几个小时，我想她不在这里。
Listen, we've been walking around for hours
and I don't think she's here.

124
00:32:19,353 --> 00:32:24,491
我觉得她在这里的某个地方，这样吧，
我们分头去找可能更快地找到她，这是最好的办法。
Well, I think she's here somewhere.
It would be the best if we split up to find her quicker.

125
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:31,752
我们不能分开找！我怕会像在那些恐怖片里的事情要发生。
We can't split up! Hello, it's just like
in all those scary movies... something will happen.

126
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:37,713
别这样懦弱，你是一个成年人 ！你走这条路我走那条路，在五分钟后我们在这里见面。
Don't be such a coward, you're an adult! You go this way,
I go that way and in five minutes we meet up again right here.

127
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,009
如果发生什么事，你可以叫我。
You can call me if something happens.

128
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,603
卡蒂！
Kati!

129
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:06,699
该死的森林 ！
God damn forest!

130
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:09,198
卡蒂！
Kati!

131
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:17,798
卡蒂？
Kati?

132
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,553
卡蒂，是你吗？
Celine, is that you?

133
00:33:29,635 --> 00:33:30,347
卡蒂？
Kati?
