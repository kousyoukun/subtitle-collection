00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,356
"嘿，嘿，嘿......這是美林和吉爾在做他們最喜歡的工作."
"Hey, hey, hey... this is Mele and Jill doing
their favorite work, their calling. "

3
00:00:48,762 --> 00:00:54,646
女孩們，這很適合你們，可比走秀好得多。你們應該開始擺幾個姿勢，或許能帶來野營所需的經費。
Girls, this suits you much better than the catwalk.
Maybe you should start advertising for camping requirements.

4
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:57,648
來吧，給我一個微笑......
Come on, give me a smile...

5
00:01:00,857 --> 00:01:03,277
這可怕的天氣，是吧？
This is awesome weather, isn't it?

6
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:08,703
我們應拿一些......他媽的，現在我們要進行所有的野營準備。
We should have picked up some guys...
Now we have to carry all that shit on our own.

7
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:12,960
大麗花，你能放下攝像機幫助我們嗎？
Dahlia, would you put down the camera
and start helping us?

8
00:01:14,913 --> 00:01:15,790
就現在。
Now.

9
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:26,810
你習慣了攝像機拍攝，別悲傷，如果你努力，就能成為你一生的事業。
You are used to cameras and again, don't cry
if you have to work hard for once in your lifetime.

10
00:01:27,384 --> 00:01:30,349
停下。你不知道什麼才是攝像。
Stop it. You don't know what real work is like.

11
00:02:12,304 --> 00:02:16,895
嗯，我們終於完成。接下來做什麼？
Well, we are finally done. What shall we do
until the others arrive?

12
00:02:17,476 --> 00:02:18,484
酒在哪堙H
Where is the wine?

13
00:02:18,643 --> 00:02:23,282
小吃在哪？我餓了...-大麗花，別吃太多。你的肚子不適合......
Where are the snacks? I'm getting hungry... -
Dahlia, stop eating so much. Your ass won't fit in...

14
00:02:23,398 --> 00:02:25,237
嘿，嘿，讓我們開始我們的宴會 ！
Hey, hey, let's start the party!

15
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,324
沒有落在我身上，也不在攝像機上 ！
Not on me, not on the camera!

16
00:02:59,768 --> 00:03:05,450
啊，好了，這成什麼樣子了。好吧，女孩。
Ah okay, that's what it looks like.
All right, girls.

17
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:08,788
想要一些嗎?
Do you want some, too?

18
00:03:09,694 --> 00:03:10,571
那是什麼?
What was that?

19
00:03:11,363 --> 00:03:13,450
這就是答案—好東西。
That was the answer to good shit.

20
00:03:16,993 --> 00:03:17,705
我什麼也沒聽到。
I don't hear anything.

21
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:20,005
好像有什麼東西。
There is something.

22
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:24,794
在哪堙H
Where is it?

23
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:30,055
正站在灌木叢堙A盯著看我們。來吧，你這個愚蠢的笨蛋 ！這是私人聚會的地方 ！
They are standing in the bushes and staring.
Come out, you stupid fuckers! This is a private party here!

24
00:03:30,674 --> 00:03:33,094
美林？美林，回來，我們離開。
Mele? Mele, come on, let's leave.

25
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:34,470
我沒看到什麼。
I don't see anything.

26
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:36,646
想要看奶子嗎？我會給你看 ！
Wanna see tits? I will get you some!

27
00:03:36,805 --> 00:03:38,525
美林，回來，你不知道誰在那堙C
Mele, come on, you don't know who is out there.

28
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,601
回來！
Come back!

29
00:03:40,475 --> 00:03:42,396
出來，他媽的混蛋 ！
Get out you fucking bastards!

30
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:20,704
媽的，又熄火了。
Damn, the engine died again.

31
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:22,826
太好了！現在怎麼辦？
Great! And now?

32
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:23,996
修好它嗎？
Repair?

33
00:05:42,055 --> 00:05:43,608
我們拿出袋子。
Let's take out the bags.

34
00:06:03,284 --> 00:06:04,458
我拿扳手。
Get me the wrench.

35
00:06:34,024 --> 00:06:35,826
這件嗎？-是的。
This one? -
One moment.

36
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:41,533
嗨 sweew
Hey sweew-

37
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:43,833
嘿，怎麼樣了?
Hey, how is it going?

38
00:06:44,075 --> 00:06:48,749
我們的車有一個小故障，但我們會準時到達。你怎麼樣了?
We've had a little break-down, but we will arrive
on time. What's up with you?

39
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,095
我現在已經完成了工作模型。這令人敬畏。我要告訴你，很快。
I have finished the model job now.
It was awesome. I need to tell you about that soon.

40
00:06:53,793 --> 00:06:57,139
我在打扮，然後我會滿足你們。
I'm dressing myself up and then I will meet you guys later.

41
00:06:57,756 --> 00:07:01,635
不是這個，另一個 ！我不認為你的小妹妹將會成為一個技工。
Not this one, the other one!
I don't think your little sister will become a mechanic.

42
00:07:02,135 --> 00:07:05,646
嘿，別對她吝嗇。你能讓她聽電話嗎？
Hey, don't be mean to her.
Could you get her the phone for a second?

43
00:07:06,055 --> 00:07:06,683
當然可以。
Sure.

44
00:07:09,017 --> 00:07:09,610
喂？
Hello?

45
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:14,115
甜心生日快樂 ！你收到禮物了嗎?
Happy birthday sweety! Did you get the present?

46
00:07:14,856 --> 00:07:18,070
是的。真是太好了。我很喜歡它。
Yes. It is very nice. I really like it.

47
00:07:19,068 --> 00:07:22,615
我很抱歉昨天沒能去你那兒。但我們今天會給你慶祝，好嗎？
I'm sorry that I couldn't be there yesterday.
But we'll make it up today, okay?

48
00:07:23,072 --> 00:07:26,702
哦，太棒了。酷斃了。
Oh, that's going to be awesome. Cool.

49
00:07:27,285 --> 00:07:30,084
席琳？先不要告訴塔尼婭，好嗎？
And Celine? Do not put up with everything
Tanja says, okay?

50
00:07:30,371 --> 00:07:33,717
不，我不會這樣做
No, I won't do that.

51
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,969
很好。回頭見。
Great. See you later.

52
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:40,643
再見。-好了，我修好了。過來收拾東西。
Bye. -
Okay, we are finished now. Come on and pack the stuff up.

53
00:09:15,852 --> 00:09:16,694
操。
Fuck.

54
00:09:30,491 --> 00:09:31,831
來吧，撿起來。
Come on, pick it up.

55
00:09:46,341 --> 00:09:51,229
嘿，Celine，是我。我有一個問題。我失去了方向，我在荒郊野外。
Hey Celine, it's me. I have a problem. I lost myway
and I am in the middle of nowhere.

56
00:09:52,055 --> 00:09:56,396
你告訴塔尼婭給我回電話？好的，謝謝你。
Could you tell Tanja to call me back?
Okay thanks, see you.

57
00:10:04,942 --> 00:10:05,866
對不起？
Excuse me?

58
00:10:13,451 --> 00:10:15,456
對不起，你能幫我嗎？
Excuse me, can you help me?

59
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,963
我失去了方向，我也不知道我在哪堙C你可以幫我嗎？
I lost myway and I have no idea where I am.
Can you help me?

60
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:29,061
你們城堣H...你看不懂簡單的地圖真是太愚蠢了。
You city slickers... you are too stupid to read a simple map.

61
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:31,970
你能不能幫我？
Can you help me or not?

62
00:10:32,303 --> 00:10:33,893
當然可以。
Yes, sure.

63
00:10:38,393 --> 00:10:42,865
我也不知道您打算去哪堙A但你在這堿O錯了。
Well, I have no idea where you are planning to go to,
but you are wrong here.

64
00:10:43,815 --> 00:10:47,077
該死 ！現在怎麼辦？
Damn! And now?

65
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:53,372
聽著，好嗎?你回頭看，開車去那邊一條道？
Listen, okay? You turn around and drive back
to the crossroadspkay?

66
00:10:54,158 --> 00:10:57,372
到那塈A右轉，然後直走繼續開車。
And there you turn right and then keep driving straight ahead.

67
00:10:57,954 --> 00:11:01,797
你將開車經過禁區。
You will get to a restricted area where you just drive through.

68
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,419
禁區？
Restricted area?

69
00:11:04,544 --> 00:11:09,265
明白了？要開車穿過禁區。
Got it? Just drive through the restricted area.

70
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,514
你說的是什麼？
What are you talking about?

71
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:15,975
那是一家污染多年來的工廠。
The factories. They contaminated everything over the years.

72
00:11:16,472 --> 00:11:24,574
但有一個工廠...一個...以前在那兒發生化學品事故。
But there was one factory... one...
where they had accidents with chemicals and stuff all the time.

73
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:33,492
有人說，員工瘋了，是因為化學氣體導致的。
Some say, that the employees went nuts because of
vapors and killed themselves in the end.

74
00:11:34,031 --> 00:11:35,122
好
Okay"-

75
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:43,042
像你這種可愛的小東西應該迅速開車穿過那個地方。
And such a sweet little thing like you should
drive through that place quickly.

76
00:11:45,042 --> 00:11:48,553
所以當你通過時，應該做個深呼吸。
So you guys should take a deep breath when you pass through.

77
00:11:50,006 --> 00:11:50,883
什麼樣的傢伙？
What guys?

78
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,392
那輛車上是你的朋友嗎？
You and your friend in that car?

79
00:11:53,926 --> 00:11:54,305
什麼？
What?

80
00:11:55,428 --> 00:11:56,140
嘿 ！
Hey!

81
00:12:17,074 --> 00:12:19,494
他媽的 ！混蛋 ！
Fuck! Asshole!

82
00:15:23,594 --> 00:15:24,768
我們到了。
So here we are.

83
00:15:26,138 --> 00:15:27,348
這是在哪堙H
And this is the location?

84
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:31,275
你看到在那堛漱k孩們的帳篷。來吧，我們稍後把行李取下來。
Sure, you can see the girls' tents over there.
Come on, we will get the bags later.

85
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:39,780
來吧！
Come on!

86
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:41,530
來...
Coming...

87
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,129
女孩 ！在哪堙H
Girls! Where are you?

88
00:15:56,252 --> 00:15:57,723
你確定是這地方？
Are you sure this is the right place?

89
00:15:58,128 --> 00:15:59,420
肯定是的。這些都是他們的帳篷。
Of course. These are their tents.

90
00:16:00,756 --> 00:16:02,558
媽的，肯定是的，他們還在這堙C
Damn sure, they were here.

91
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,182
好吧，我沒看到這埵野籉韝H。
Well, I don't see anyone here.

92
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:25,540
禁區，污染危險，不能進入
RESTRICTED AREA RISK OF
CONTAMINATION DO NOT ENTER

93
00:16:42,506 --> 00:16:43,265
等等。
Wait.

94
00:16:48,637 --> 00:16:49,514
有鈴聲。
It's ringing.

95
00:16:57,354 --> 00:16:58,564
美林的手機。
It's Mele's cell phone.

96
00:16:59,815 --> 00:17:01,368
她去哪兒了呢？
Why did she leave it here?

97
00:17:32,473 --> 00:17:32,935
喂？
Hello?

98
00:17:36,685 --> 00:17:37,812
有人嗎?
Is someone here?

99
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:51,498
我打電話給卡蒂。
I call Kati.

100
00:18:13,972 --> 00:18:15,774
卡蒂？喂？
Kati? Hello?

101
00:18:16,975 --> 00:18:17,852
發生了什麼事？
What happened?

102
00:18:18,727 --> 00:18:19,521
我不知道。
I don't know.

103
00:18:19,728 --> 00:18:21,649
該死的。-拜託，別出什麼事。
Damn. -
Come on, there is something wrong.

104
00:19:09,069 --> 00:19:10,326
有人嗎？
Hello?

105
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:00,103
媽的。
Shit.

106
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:50,962
你看，那邊有張地圖。
Look, the map over there.

107
00:22:59,841 --> 00:23:01,513
這是卡蒂的地圖。
That is Kati's map.

108
00:23:01,676 --> 00:23:06,101
真的嗎？-是的，她來過這堙C來吧，我們看一看。
Really? - Yes, she must have been here before.
Come on, let's have a look.

109
00:23:06,723 --> 00:23:10,270
她為什麼會孤自去樹林?-我不知道。我們找找。
But why would she go in the woods alone?-
I have no clue. Let's check it out.

110
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:21,656
卡蒂？
Kati?

111
00:23:25,325 --> 00:23:26,997
卡蒂，你在哪媔隉H
Kati, where are you?

112
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,080
有人嗎？
Hello?

113
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,707
卡蒂？
Kati?

114
00:25:23,985 --> 00:25:24,862
那是什麼？
What's that?

115
00:25:35,663 --> 00:25:36,256
他媽的 ！
Fuck!

116
00:25:58,853 --> 00:26:01,356
這不是真的。為什麼鎖住了門？
That can't be true. Why is everything locked?

117
00:26:31,427 --> 00:26:32,351
媽的!
Nu!

118
00:27:33,990 --> 00:28:09,324
校對：飄走JWL(QQ：864231348)

119
00:31:18,047 --> 00:31:19,055
他媽的。
Shit.

120
00:31:30,184 --> 00:31:30,646
媽的!
Fuck it!

121
00:31:40,695 --> 00:31:41,454
他媽的。
Shit.

122
00:31:55,626 --> 00:31:56,634
卡蒂！
Kati!

123
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,558
卡蒂！
Kati!

124
00:32:12,226 --> 00:32:13,697
我累了。
I'm tired.

125
00:32:15,187 --> 00:32:18,734
聽著，我們已經在附近走了幾個小時，我想她不在這堙C
Listen, we've been walking around for hours
and I don't think she's here.

126
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:24,537
我覺得她在這堛漪Y個地方，這樣吧，
我們分頭去找可能更快地找到她，這是最好的辦法。
Well, I think she's here somewhere.
It would be the best if we split up to find her quicker.

127
00:32:25,072 --> 00:32:31,798
我們不能分開找！我怕會像在那些恐怖片堛漕き＃n發生。
We can't split up! Hello, it's just like
in all those scary movies... something will happen.

128
00:32:32,621 --> 00:32:37,758
別這樣懦弱，你是一個成年人 ！你走這條路我走那條路，在五分鐘後我們在這堥ㄜ情C
Don't be such a coward, you're an adult! You go this way,
I go that way and in five minutes we meet up again right here.

129
00:32:38,252 --> 00:32:40,054
如果發生什麼事，你可以叫我。
You can call me if something happens.

130
00:32:57,605 --> 00:32:58,648
卡蒂！
Kati!

131
