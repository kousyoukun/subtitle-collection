<i>New York, before I was born.</i>

8

<i>I know I'm dreaming. But it
feels like more than that.</i>

9
00:01:12,449 --> 00:01:14,743
<i>It feels like a memory.</i>

10
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:19,080
<i>How can that be?</i>

11
00:01:28,882 --> 00:01:32,177
<i>March 14th, 2077.</i>

12

<i>Five years since
the mandatory memory wipe.</i>

13

<i>And I'm still haunted

<i>In two weeks, our mission here will be
finished, and we'll join the others.</i>

<i>It's been half a century since the

19

<i>Forced to leave their own dying
planet, they came to take ours.</i>

20
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:08,338
<i>Without the moon, the Earth
was thrown into chaos.</i>

21

<i>Earthquakes toppled
cities within hours.</i>

<i>Tsunamis wiped
out what remained.</i>

<i>We did what we had to do.</i>

25
00:02:20,183 --> 00:02:22,268
<i>We used the nukes.</i>

26
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:27,440
<i>We won the war,
but lost the planet.</i>

27
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:31,653
<i>Left it contaminated.
Most of it uninhabitable.</i>

28

<i>What remained of humanity
had to leave the Earth.</i>

29

<i>We built the Tet,

<i>We protect the hydro rigs,</i>

<i>which convert
Earth's sea water</i>

37

No sign

I'm reading the whole

and picks up his own fumble.

Call them scavs.

They destroyed our moon and
with that, half the planet.

Then they invaded.

404

481
00:54:23,345 --> 00:54:26,139
Do they bring
back old memories?

482
00:54:26,306 --> 00:54:28,642
You won't get
anything from me.

483
00:54:28,808 --> 00:54:30,477
My memory has been
wiped to protect...

484
00:54:30,644 --> 00:54:33,563
...the security of
the mission. Yes.

485
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:37,025
You can't have
your precious memory

486
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:39,444
falling into the wrong

00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,238
Tell me.

488

Have you ever met
a scav up close?

489
00:54:48,578 --> 00:54:52,499
Of course not.
You just repair drones.

"Don't go into

We're human.

496

Can you hear me, Jack?

500
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:54,686
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
Keeps your drones confused.

501
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:58,565
Well, most of the time.

502
00:55:58,982 --> 00:56:00,150
The drones are programmed...

503
00:56:00,233 --> 00:56:01,860
To kill humans, Jack.

504
00:56:02,068 --> 00:56:05,030
You saw what they did
to those sleep pods.

505
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:09,409
You almost got yourself blown
to bits protecting that woman.

506
00:56:14,205 --> 00:56:15,665
Why did you do that?

507
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:18,585
Anyone would have.

508
00:56:18,752 --> 00:56:19,961
"Anyone."

509
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:22,630
Interesting.

511

BEECH: That's Sergeant Sykes.

He thinks I'm a fool for

"We've got to

That was just one fuel cell.

We need you to

Have it carry our

973
01:51:16,504 --> 01:51:21,509
<i>There's been a pattern of
insubordinate behavior recently.</i>

974
01:51:22,802 --> 01:51:24,095
Yeah.

975
01:51:24,596 --> 01:51:26,514
I feel bad about that.

976
01:51:27,724 --> 01:51:31,519
<i>Voice analysis indicates
you are lying to me, Jack.</i>

977
01:51:31,686 --> 01:51:33,480
<i>Tell me why you are here.</i>

978
01:51:33,646 --> 01:51:35,273
<i>You have five seconds.</i>

979
01:51:42,489 --> 01:51:44,574
I want Julia to live.

980
01:51:45,992 --> 01:51:48,661
I want our species
to survive.

981
01:51:50,705 --> 01:51:52,665
This is the only way.

982
01:51:58,380 --> 01:52:02,217
<i>Proceed to landing.
Atmosphere provided.</i>

983
01:53:00,358 --> 01:53:03,528
<i>Welcome home, Jack.</i>

984
01:53:16,499 --> 01:53:17,500
Come on.

985
01:53:17,667 --> 01:53:20,503
<i>Jack,
you're doing the right thing.</i>

986
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:24,382
JACK: I don't know what you
are, or where you're from,

987
01:53:26,259 --> 01:53:29,262
but I'd like to tell you
about something I read.

988
01:53:30,221 --> 01:53:33,349
A story from Rome,

989
01:53:34,350 --> 01:53:36,853
a city you destroyed.

990
01:53:37,687 --> 01:53:39,355
It's a classic.

991
01:53:40,231 --> 01:53:43,359
There was a guy, Horatius,

992
01:53:44,235 --> 01:53:47,363
held the bridge alone
against a whole army.

993
01:53:47,530 --> 01:53:49,991
And what Horatius said was,

994
01:53:50,158 --> 01:53:52,202
"How can a man die better..."

995
01:53:52,368 --> 01:53:56,956
<i>You don't have to die, Jack.
She doesn't have to die.</i>

996
01:53:57,123 --> 01:53:59,501
Everybody dies, Sally.

997
01:53:59,667 --> 01:54:01,377
The thing is, to die well.

998
01:54:10,386 --> 01:54:14,891
<i>Jack, that's not
the survivor you promised me.</i>

999
01:54:15,642 --> 01:54:17,644
No, it's not.

1000
01:54:40,166 --> 01:54:43,878
What Horatius said was,

1001
01:54:44,045 --> 01:54:47,048
"How can a man die better

1002
01:54:49,050 --> 01:54:52,554
<i>JACK:
"Than facing fearful odds"</i>

1003
01:54:52,971 --> 01:54:56,307
Drones!
Get inside! Get inside!

1004
01:54:56,474 --> 01:54:58,142
<i>JACK:
"For the ashes of his fathers</i>

1005
01:55:01,187 --> 01:55:03,773
<i>"And the temples of his Gods"</i>

1006
01:55:05,316 --> 01:55:07,443
<i>SALLY: I created you, Jack.</i>

1007
01:55:07,610 --> 01:55:09,696
<i>I am your God.</i>

1008
01:55:22,083 --> 01:55:23,751
Fuck you, Sally.

1009
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:20,141
<i>JACK: Earth, after the war.</i>

1010
01:56:20,808 --> 01:56:24,270
<i>Three years have passed
since I saw your face.</i>

1011
01:56:25,897 --> 01:56:29,567
<i>I wonder if I come to
you at night, in dreams.</i>

1012
01:56:30,443 --> 01:56:33,946
<i>In the day, as memories.</i>

1013
01:56:35,198 --> 01:56:38,951
<i>Do I haunt your hours
the way you haunted mine?</i>

1014
01:56:41,496 --> 01:56:42,914
<i>And I wonder if you see me</i>

1015
01:56:43,581 --> 01:56:45,249
<i>when you look at her.</i>

1016
01:56:57,387 --> 01:56:59,305
Mommy, look.

1017
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:09,148
<i>If we have souls, they are
made of the love we share.</i>

1018
01:57:12,652 --> 01:57:14,987
<i>Undimmed by time.</i>

1019
01:57:16,072 --> 01:57:18,408
<i>Unbound by death.</i>

1020
01:57:36,092 --> 01:57:39,637
<i>For three years, I searched
for the house he built.</i>

1021
01:57:41,514 --> 01:57:42,932
<i>I knew it had to be out there.</i>

1022
01:57:46,769 --> 01:57:49,147
<i>Because I know him.</i>

1023
01:57:56,904 --> 01:57:58,906
<i>lam him.</i>

1024
01:58:01,159 --> 01:58:02,326
Who's that?

1025
01:58:10,626 --> 01:58:13,087
<i>I am Jack Harper.</i>

1026
01:58:14,505 --> 01:58:17,175
<i>And I am home.</i>

932
