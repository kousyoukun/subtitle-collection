战争开始之前的地球
JACK: Earth, before the war.

2
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:48,717
在我出生之前的纽约
New York, before I was born.

3
00:00:49,843 --> 00:00:53,847
这些画面只出现在相片里
A place I've only seen pictures of.

4
00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:55,598
我认识你
I know you...

5
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,726
却从未谋面
But we've never met.

6
00:00:59,144 --> 00:01:00,770
我和你在一起
I'm with you...

7
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,315
却不知你的名字
But I don't know your name.

8
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:10,780
我知道我在做梦，感觉却如此真实
I know I'm dreaming. But it feels like more than that.

9
00:01:12,449 --> 00:01:14,743
就像是我的记忆
It feels like a memory.

10
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:19,080
怎么会这样
How can that be?

11
00:01:28,882 --> 00:01:32,177
2077年3月14日
March 14th, 2077.

12
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:35,388
距离记忆清除整整五年
Five years since the mandatory memory wipe.

13
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:38,516
我仍然被这些梦折磨着
And I'm still haunted by these dreams.

14
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:43,980
维多利亚奉命跟我在一起
Victoria and I were assigned together.

15
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:48,485
两周之后 我们将完成这里的任务 跟其他人会合
In two weeks, our mission here will be finished, and we'll join the others.

16
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:52,155
我常有的疑问 她没有
But the questions I ask, she doesn't.

17
00:01:52,322 --> 00:01:55,325
我一直有的困惑 她也没有
The things I wonder about, she won't.

18
00:01:56,618 --> 00:02:00,371
五十年前 拾荒者摧毁了我们的月球
It's been half a century since the scavengers destroyed our moon.

19
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:05,001
他们的星球即将毁灭 便把目光盯向我们
Forced to leave their own dying planet, they came to take ours.

20
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:08,338
没有了月球 地球陷入了一片混乱
Without the moon, the Earth was thrown into chaos.

21
00:02:08,505 --> 00:02:10,840
地震把城市摧毁
Earthquakes toppled cities within hours.

22
00:02:11,508 --> 00:02:14,302
海啸吞噬了一切
Tsunamis wiped out what remained.

23
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:16,513
入侵随后而来
Then came the invasion.

24
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,682
无奈之下
We did what we had to do.

25
00:02:20,183 --> 00:02:22,268
我们动用了核武器
We used the nukes.

26
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:27,440
我们赢得了战争 却失去了自己的星球
We won the war, but lost the planet.

27
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:32,528
地球被严重污染 已经不适合人类居住
Left it contaminated. Most of it uninhabitable.

28
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:36,658
人类别无选择 只能离开地球
What remained of humanity had to leave the Earth.

29
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:40,829
我们建造了泰特 我们的指挥中心

30
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:44,374
临时空间站 准备移居泰坦星
A temporary space station before the migration to Titan,

31
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,543

所有人都过去了
Everyone's there now.

33
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,923

00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:56,636
维多利亚和我有任务
Until our tour is complete, Vika and I do our job.

35
00:02:56,803 --> 00:02:58,388
我们保卫钻水平台
We protect the hydro rigs,

36
00:02:58,555 --> 00:03:00,473
它把地球上的海水
which convert Earth's sea water

37
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:02,559
转化成新领地所需的混合能源
into fusion energy for the new colony.

38
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:05,144
人类的生存关乎于此
The survival of humanity depends on it.

39
00:03:08,398 --> 00:03:09,399
(CHUCKLES)

谢谢你的咖啡
Thank you for the coffee.

41
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:15,947
拾荒者的军队一直骚扰我们
Remnants of the scavenger army continue to disrupt the operation.

42
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,533
他们夜间偷袭我们的无人机
They attack our drones at night,

43
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:20,910
白天试图杀掉我们
and try to kill me during the day.

44
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:24,247
没完没了 不知道为什么
There's still fight in them, but I don't know why.

45
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:28,167
指挥中心说我们两个干得不错
Mission says we have done well.

46
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:32,005
我们是一对默契的搭档

47
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:44,183
维多利亚是我的通讯联络官
Vika's my communications officer.

48
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,352
她负责照顾我

我负责维护无人机
I handle drone maintenance.

50
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:52,275
无人机则监视一切
The drones watch everything.

51
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:58,498
维多利亚很期待撤离 我却不确定
Vika can't wait to go. Me, I'm not so sure.

52
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:01,117
我无法抹去对地球的感觉
I can't shake the feeling that Earth,

53
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,411
尽管已无法挽回 
in spite of all that's happened...

54
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:06,164
地球 毕竟是我的故乡
Earth is still my home.

55

没有拾荒者的活动迹象

我这里看不到什么 角度太小了

看起来比赛就要结束
Looks like the game is over.

138
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:39,181
所有芯体位置都不对
I'm reading the whole central core off-alignment.

139
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:41,350

You don't have the necessary tools down there.

140
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:43,144
新的燃料电池又不匹配
And a new fuel cell is not going to fix that.

141
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:49,358
- 四分卫掉过头 捡起脱手的球
But this QB runs back, and picks up his own fumble.

142
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:50,693
 - 等等 你在干什么
Hold on, what did you just do?

143
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,404
对方许多球员像一面墙压过来
There's a wall of linebackers closing in on him.

144
00:10:55,323 --> 00:11:00,218
他把球扔了出去 也不管谁能接到
So, he throws a long ball with no idea who is at the other end.

145
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:02,038
真是个奇迹
A Hail Mary.

146
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:06,125
八万名观众都起立
Eighty-thousand people on their feet,

147
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,419
看球在空中飞过 
watching this ball sail through the air.

148
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:15,384
在前场的是个新手 三队的外接球员
Downfield is a rookie wide receiver, third string.

149
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:18,054
他从人群中轻轻一跃
He just leaps out of the pack.

150
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,599
触底得分
Touchdown!

151
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:23,726
(IMITATES CHEERING)

152
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:41,786
西边 发现情况
Contact! West contact!

153
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:46,540
杰克
VICTORIA: Jack?

154
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:48,250
没事 维多利亚
It's okay, Vika.

155
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:51,087
是一只狗
It's just a dog.

156
00:11:58,344 --> 00:11:59,345
Hey.

157
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,889
你快走吧 快离开这儿
Now, go on. You gotta get out of here.

158
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:04,266
走
Go on, get!

159
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,560
离开这儿 走
Get out of here! Go!

160
00:12:14,944 --> 00:12:16,779
49号 杰克・哈珀
Tech-49, Jack Harper.

161
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:45,724
不用客气
You're welcome.

162
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:46,809
(SCOFFS)

163
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:51,772
166号恢复正常
166 is back online.

164
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:03,668
今天又被击落两架 一个月被偷了10块燃料电池
Two drones shot down today. Ten fuel cells stolen in just over a month.

165
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,995
这些家伙越来越嚣张了
These scavs are getting bolder.

166
00:13:06,162 --> 00:13:08,164
平台正在吸纳海水
VICTORIA: Well, the hydro rigs are taking all the water.

167
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:11,417
我们走后 他们只有灰尘和射线
Once we're gone, they'll have nothing but dust and radiation.

168
00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:13,836
狗屁逻辑
JACK: This is bullshit.

169
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:18,507
我们打赢了 却要被迫撤离
We won the war. Now we have to leave.

170
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,511
再有两个星期
Two more weeks, Jack.

171
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:25,514
我们就可以去泰坦星了
Then we'll be on our way to Titan.

172
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:27,850
对
Yep.

173
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:31,479
那个无人机还在某处
That drone is out there somewhere.

174
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,024
得想办法找到它
We just have to find it.

175
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:38,527
没有灯标 找它无异于大海捞针
Without a beacon, that's like finding a needle in a haystack.

176
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:40,196
(CHUCKLES)

177
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:49,205
所以得当步兵了
So we go to our ground game.

178
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:34,828
塔台 我找到172号了
Tower, I've located 172

179
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:37,563
在一个大洞里
down a sinkhole.

180
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,815
看不见 但能听到
No visual, but I can hear it.

181
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:42,067
我这里角度很差 只能看到你 
Tet's so far off angle, I can barely see you.

182
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:43,444
它怎么样
How's it look?

183
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:48,407
还好 上面没发现敌人的迹象
It's good, it's good. There's no sign of scav activity on top.

184
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:50,618
泰特15分钟后离线 
Tet's offline in 15 minutes.

185
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:54,496
就靠你了
After that, you're on your own.

186
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:14,016
这里是49号塔台
VICTORIA: Mission, this is Tower 49.

187
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:18,354
杰克已经找到了172号 全力修复
Jack has located drone 172. Engaged in recovery now.

188
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,940
请求尽快向他的位置派出支援
Requesting backup to his location ASAP.

189
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:53,013
我看到172号
I've got a visual on Drone 172.

190
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,057
杰克
Jack?

191
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:12,491
(CLATTERS)

192
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:02,750
什么情况
What the hell?

193
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,380
该死
Shit.

194
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:10,966
(GRUNTS)

195
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:47,002
(GRUNTS)

196
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:05,354
Ha!

197
00:19:46,975 --> 00:19:47,975
（锁定 攻击）

198
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,189
杰克
Jack!

199
00:19:59,175 --> 00:20:00,175
（消灭）

200
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,264
49号 杰克・哈珀
Tech-49, Jack Harper.

201
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:27,603
杰克・哈珀 J49号
Jack Harper, Tech-49!

202
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:30,147
Hey!

203
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,528
不 拜托
Oh, no.

204
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:23,951
该死的 别偷我的摩托车
Come on. Not my goddamn bike!

205
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:32,102
对人类来说 怎样才是最好的死亡方式
JACK: (READING) "How can a man die better Than facing fearful odds"

206
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:35,355
为了自己信仰的圣殿和祖先的足迹
"For the ashes of his fathers And the temples of his Gods"

207
00:22:35,564 --> 00:22:36,732
杰克
VICTORIA: Jack?

208
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:40,527
好了 我马上就来
Yep, I'll be right there.

209
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:49,068
古罗马谣曲集 麦考利著

210
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:59,713
109号怎么样
VICTORIA: How does 109 look?

211
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,881
- 还能飞吗
Can it fly?

212
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:02,716
- 基本不能了
Barely.

213
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:06,428
要是没有装甲 它就是个活靶子
And without armor, she's a sitting duck.

214
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:09,598
我跟萨莉说防护盾的事
Well, I'll talk to Sally about that shielding in the morning.

215
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,892
-行啊 -再一次
-Okay. -Again.

216
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:13,310
(CHUCKLES)

217
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:20,192
怎么了 杰克・哈珀
What, Jack Harper?

218
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,659
这是哪儿来的
Where did you get this?

219
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,203
它就长在
It was growing in...

220
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:34,081
(DOOR OPENING)

221
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:47,636
好了 杰克 你知道规矩
Come on, Jack, you know the regulations.

222
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:48,970
你认为我很死板
I know you think I'm a stickler

223
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:52,474
你不知道这是什么 也许是伪装成花的毒素
but you have no idea what kind of toxins could be in something like that.

224
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:54,184
它就是花 维多利亚
It's a flower, Vika.

225
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:55,477
这不是关键
Yeah, that's not the point.

226
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:57,646
我们的任务已接近尾声
It's that we are so close to the end,

227
00:23:57,813 --> 00:24:00,565
我不想在最后时刻无谓地冒险
and the last thing that we need is you putting it all at risk.

228
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:04,069
好吧
Okay.

229
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:09,741
每天你都要去地面
Every day, you have to go down there

230
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:13,578
查看有什么损失
and see what was lost.

231
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:17,207
我们的工作已经完成了 杰克
But we've done our job, Jack.

232
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,879
该离开这里了
It's time to go.

233
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:32,097
我不认为 他们今天想杀死我
I don't think they were trying to kill me today.

234
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:34,182
那些家伙
The scavs.

235
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:41,148
他们想抓住我
They were trying to catch me.

236
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:48,446
那是不可能的
Well, they can't have you.

237
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:06,047
来吧
Come on.

238
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:08,348
走之前 你应该跟我下去看看
You should come with me sometime, before we leave.

239
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:11,238
我发现个地方 想让你看看
There's a place I found I'd like to show you.

240
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:17,369
我也有东西给你看
(WHISPERS)I'll show you something.

241
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:20,914
Hey,hey!

242
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:21,683
(PANTS)

243
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:29,232
(RUMBLING)

244
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:44,998
我的天呐
Oh, my God.

245
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:56,718
是钻水平台内部的六级核芯融化
VICTORIA: It was a six-stage meltdown from inside the hydro rig's core.

246
00:27:57,052 --> 00:27:58,511
已经彻底失去了动力
It's offline permanently.

247
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:01,431
49号塔台 你把整个计划置于危险之中
SALLY: Tower 49, you have put the whole operation at risk.

248
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:03,683
我要知道发生了什么事
I need to know exactly what happened.

249
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,561
杰克认为是拾荒者把偷走的燃料电池制成武器
VICTORIA: Jack believes the scavs weaponized one of the stolen fuel cells

250
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:08,772
放入了反应堆中
and got it into the suction.

251
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,357
塔台 保持通话
SALLY: Tower, hold.

252
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:17,048
塔台 37号区域发现不属于我们的信号 你看到了吗
Tower, I've got a rogue signal in Grid 37. Are you seeing this?

253
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:17,572
看到了
Yes.

254
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:19,366
肯定是拾荒者
JACK: It's gotta be scav.

255
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:21,576
不是我们的信号
It's not one of ours.

256
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:27,088
杰克 信号是向地球以外的地方发送的
Jack, the signal is being directed off-planet.

257
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:27,749
我去看看
On my Way-

258
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:33,088
塔台 我们的工作日志显示你们又失去了9块燃料电池 
Tower, our logs show you are missing an additional nine fuel cells.

259
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:34,255
你能确定吗
Can you confirm?

260
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:36,466
不 指挥中心 应该是10块
Negative, Mission, that number is 10.

261
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:39,052
172号昨晚已经损毁了
Drone 172 was lost last night.

262
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:43,098
109号整装待发 只等防护盾到位
109 is combat-ready as soon as we get that shielding.

263
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:45,308
可以用其它的无人机保护其余的平台 
We can cover the remaining rigs with drones in the field.

264
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:46,434
我心中有数
I've run the numbers.

265
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:48,436
计划是我的事 塔台
We'll do the numbers up here, Tower.

266
00:28:48,603 --> 00:28:51,022
我正派无人机前往防御位置
I'm tasking the drones to defensive positions.

267
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:52,690
收到
COPY-

268
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:56,111
我们的任务是保证平台运转 给你们的指令是保护它们
Our job is to run those rigs. Your directive is to protect them.

269
00:28:56,194 --> 00:28:59,948
绝不能再失去一个平台
We cannot afford to lose another. Do you copy?

270
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:01,032
明白了吗
COPY

271
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:04,048
明白 你们是不是最佳搭档
Are you and Jack an effective team?

272
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:04,577
你说得很正确
Damn right we are.

273
00:29:12,768 --> 00:29:14,768
（未知信号）

274
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:16,464
杰克
Jack?

275
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:19,134
你在它上面 能看见吗
You're right on top of it. Do you have a visual?

276
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:22,470
杰克
Jack?

277
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:24,722
能 看见了
Yeah, I got it.

278
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:12,914
发现信号发射装置
They have some kind of a repeater.

279
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:17,502
拾荒者 把这个建筑物当成了天线
The scavs are using the building as an antenna.

280
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:18,670
你能破译吗
Can you decrypt?

What was your mission?

591
01:03:51,412 --> 01:03:55,249
去泰坦星做探索飞行 第一个任务
It was a research flight to Titan. My first.

592

原定的任务如此
That's what it was supposed to be.

593
01:04:01,088 --> 01:04:05,718
出发前六个星期 深度空间探测器发现了一个外星物体

就是泰特 杰克

我不知道发生了什么 但你绝不是你想的那样
I don't know what happened, but you're not who you think you are.

606
01:05:01,941 --> 01:05:04,318
杰克 我们曾经在这儿 
Jack, we were here.

607
01:05:05,361 --> 01:05:11,218
你让我在这里等你 带我到世界最高的地方
You asked me to meet you, brought me up on top of the world.

608
01:05:15,162 --> 01:05:18,124
我还记得那天你有多紧张

就是在这里 杰克
It was right here, Jack.

在我回去前别向总部汇报
Do not report to Mission until I get back. Do you copy?

625
01:07:56,782 --> 01:07:58,242

Do you COPY?

Jack, that's not the survivor you promised me.

1006
01:54:15,642 --> 01:54:17,644
对 不是那个
No, it's not.

1007
01:54:40,166 --> 01:54:43,878
贺雷修斯说的是
What Horatius said was,

1008
01:54:44,045 --> 01:54:47,048
究竟怎样才算死得其所
"How can a man die better

1009
01:54:49,050 --> 01:54:52,554
而不用面对死亡的恐惧
JACK: "Than facing fearful odds"

1010
01:54:52,971 --> 01:54:56,307
无人机 快进来
Drones! Get inside! Get inside!

1011
01:54:56,474 --> 01:54:58,142
莫过于为了祖先的足迹
JACK: "For the ashes of his fathers

1012
01:55:01,187 --> 01:55:03,773
和自己信仰的圣殿
"And the temples of his Gods"

1013
01:55:05,316 --> 01:55:07,443
是我创造了你 杰克 
SALLY: I created you, Jack.

1014
01:55:07,610 --> 01:55:09,696
我就是你的神
I am your God.

1015
01:55:22,083 --> 01:55:23,751
你去死吧 萨莉
Fuck you, Sally.

1016
01:56:15,408 --> 01:56:20,141
地球 大战之后
JACK: Earth, after the war.

1017
01:56:20,738 --> 01:56:24,270
距离上次见你已经整整3年了
Three years have passed since I saw your face.

1018
01:56:24,608 --> 01:56:29,567
在夜里 在梦里 你见过我吗
I wonder if I come to you at night, in dreams.

1019
01:56:29,638 --> 01:56:33,946
在白天 在记忆里
In the day, as memories.

1020
01:56:34,068 --> 01:56:38,951
你是否会想起我 就像我想起你一样
Do I haunt your hours the way you haunted mine?

1021
01:56:40,308 --> 01:56:42,914
能看到我吗
And I wonder if you see me

1022
01:56:43,581 --> 01:56:45,249
当你看到她的时候
when you look at her.

1023
01:56:56,268 --> 01:56:59,305
妈妈 看
Mommy, look.

1024
01:57:03,278 --> 01:57:09,148
如果我们有灵魂 那是我们的爱铸就的
If we have souls, they are made of the love we share.

1025
01:57:11,558 --> 01:57:14,987
永不消散
Undimmed by time.

1026
01:57:15,188 --> 01:57:18,408
至死不渝
Unbound by death.

1027
01:57:34,968 --> 01:57:39,637
这3年来 我一直在找他建的房子
For three years, I searched for the house he built.

1028
01:57:40,418 --> 01:57:43,038
我知道一定在什么地方
I knew it had to be out there.

1029
01:57:45,288 --> 01:57:49,147
因为我了解他
Because I know him.

1030
01:57:55,758 --> 01:57:58,906
我就是他
I am him.

1031
01:57:59,968 --> 01:58:02,326
他是谁
Who's that?

1032
01:58:09,358 --> 01:58:13,087
我是杰克・哈珀
I am Jack Harper.

1033
01:58:13,298 --> 01:58:17,175
我终于回家了
And I am home.

1034
01:58:19,098 --> 01:58:22,098
