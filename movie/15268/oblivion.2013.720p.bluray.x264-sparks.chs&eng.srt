五十年前 外星人摧毁了我们的月球
<i>It's been half a century since the scavengers destroyed our moon.</i>

23
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,003
他们的星球即将毁灭 便把目光盯向我们
<i>Forced to leave their own dying planet, they came to take ours.</i>

我们动用了核武器

30
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,447
我们赢得了战争 却失去了自己的星球

31
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,645
地球被严重污染 已经不适合人类居住

971
01:47:58,320 --> 01:47:59,840
We're not getting away from this thing.

972
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:02,526
奥德赛 传感器显示结构性应力过载
<i>Odyssey, telemetry shows structural overstress.</i>

973
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:05,047
马上关闭引擎 听到了吗
<i>Knock off the burn. Do you copy?</i>

974
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:06,367
马上关闭引擎

976
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:12,645

978
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:17,049
接近目标的加速度增大

979
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:19,282
预计两分钟内发生碰撞
Estimated contact within two minutes.

980
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:26,808
我要把休眠舱弹射出去
I'm going to eject the sleep module.

981
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:29,488
它的设定程度是重新进入地球轨道
It's programmed for reinsertion into Earth orbit.

982
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:32,564
然后我驾驶指挥舱飞离目标
I'll fly the Command module out if I break free.

983
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:34,529
- 你快进入休眠舱 - 我不能丢下你
I want you back there now. Absolutely not.

<font color="#D900D9">(ALARM CONTINUES)</font>

989
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:49,361
杰克

01:49:50,630 --> 01:49:52,000
（录音播放完毕）

<font color="#D900D9">(WHISPERS)</font> You buck up, Bob.

994
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,321
别在那儿哆哆嗦嗦的
Don't go all shaky on me.

995
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:09,124
杰克 我好像注意到
<font color="#808080">SALLY:</font> <i>Jack, I can't help notice</i>

996
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:13,001
你的呼吸和心率都在加快
<i>your respiration and heart rate have increased.</i>

997
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:16,320
终于能跟你见面 使我非常激动
I'm just excited to finally meet you, Sally.

998
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:21,526
你的这种反常现象 最近经常出现
<i>There's been a pattern of insubordinate behavior recently.</i>

999
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:24,086
是啊
Yeah.

1000
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:26,523
我感到非常抱歉
I feel bad about that.

1001
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:31,520
音频分析显示你在说谎 杰克
<i>Voice analysis indicates you are lying to me, Jack.</i>

1002
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:33,489
告诉我你来的目的
<i>Tell me why you are here.</i>

1003
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:35,290
五秒钟内回答我
<i>You have five seconds.</i>

1004
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:44,562
我想让茱莉娅活下来
I want Julia to live.

1005
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,685
我想让人类生存下来
I want our species to survive.

1006
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:52,688
这是唯一的办法
This is the only way.

1007
01:51:58,360 --> 01:52:02,206
请准备降落 已提供正常氧气

1008
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:03,523
欢迎回家 杰克

1009
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:17,481
来吧
Come on.

1010
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:20,524
杰克 你的决定很正确
<i>Jack, you're doing the right thing.</i>

1011
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:24,402
我不知道你是什么 从什么地方来的
<font color="#808080">JACK:</font> I don't know what you are, or where you're from,

1012
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:29,289
我想告诉你 我看过的
but I'd like to tell you about something I read.

1013
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:33,369
一个故事 讲的是罗马
A story from Rome,

1014
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:36,840
一个毁灭了的城市
a city you destroyed.

1015
01:53:37,680 --> 01:53:39,364
故事很经典
It's a classic.

1016
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:43,369
有个家伙 叫贺雷修斯
There was a guy, Horatius,

1017
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:47,369
一个人在桥上抵抗整支军队
held the bridge alone against a whole army.

1018
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:50,000
当时贺雷修斯说了一句话
And what Horatius said was,

1019
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:52,208
究竟怎样才算死得其所
"How can a man die better..."

1020
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:56,968
你是不会死的 杰克 她也不会死
<i>You don't have to die, Jack. She doesn't have to die.</i>

1021
01:53:57,120 --> 01:53:59,521
所有人都会死 萨莉
Everybody dies, Sally.

1022
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:01,364
但要死得其所
The thing is, to die well.

1023
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:14,883
杰克 这不是你之前跟我说过的幸存者
<i>Jack, that's not the survivor you promised me.</i>

1024
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:17,642
对 不是那个
No, it's not.

1025
01:54:40,160 --> 01:54:43,881
贺雷修斯说的是
What Horatius said was,

1026
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:47,044
究竟怎样才算死得其所
"How can a man die better"

1027
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:52,567
而不用面对死亡的恐惧
<font color="#808080">JACK:</font> <i>"Than facing fearful odds"</i>

1028
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:56,328
无人机 快进来
Drones! Get inside! Get inside!

1029
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:58,164
莫过于为了祖先的足迹
<font color="#808080">JACK:</font> <i>"For the ashes of his fathers"</i>

1030
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:03,771
和自己信仰的圣殿
<i>"And the temples of his Gods"</i>

1031
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:07,448
是我创造了你 杰克
<font color="#808080">SALLY:</font> <i>I created you, Jack.</i>

1032
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:09,682
我就是你的信仰
<i>I am your God.</i>

1033
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:23,764
你去死吧 萨莉
Fuck you, Sally.

1034
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:20,161
地球 大战之后
<font color="#808080">JACK:</font> <i>Earth, after the war.</i>

1035
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:24,282
距离上次见你已经整整三年了
<i>Three years have passed since I saw your face.</i>

1036
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:29,566
不知道该不该去找你 在夜里 在梦里
<i>I wonder if I come to you at night, in dreams.</i>

1037
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:33,967
在白天 在记忆里
<i>In the day, as memories.</i>

1038
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:38,966
你是否会想起我 就像我想起你一样
<i>Do I haunt your hours the way you haunted mine?</i>

1039
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:42,925
当你看到她的时候
<i>And I wonder if you see me</i>

1040
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:45,250
能看到我吗
<i>when you look at her.</i>

1041
01:56:57,400 --> 01:56:59,323
妈妈 看
Mommy, look.

1042
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:09,168
如果我们有灵魂 那是我们的爱铸就的
<i>If we have souls, they are made of the love we share.</i>

1043
01:57:12,640 --> 01:57:15,007
永不消散
<i>Undimmed by time.</i>

1044
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:18,401
至死不渝
<i>Unbound by death.</i>

1045
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:39,641
这三年来 我一直在找他建的房子
<i>For three years, I searched for the house he built.</i>

1046
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:42,931
我知道一定在什么地方
<i>I knew it had to be out there.</i>

1047
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:49,161
因为我了解他
<i>Because I know him.</i>

1048
01:57:56,920 --> 01:57:58,922
我就是他
<i>I am him.</i>

1049
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:02,321
他是谁
Who's that?

1050
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:13,086
我是杰克・哈珀
<i>I am Jack Harper.</i>

1051
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:17,171
我终于回家了
