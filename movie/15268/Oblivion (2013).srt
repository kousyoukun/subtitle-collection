五十年前 外星人摧毁了我们的月球
It's been half a century since the scavengers destroyed our moon.

22
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,003
他们的星球即将毁灭 便把目光盯向我们
Forced to leave their own dying planet, they came to take ours.

23

我们赢得了战争 却失去了自己的星球

地球被严重污染 已经不适合人类居住

致命的外星军队一直骚扰我们

他们夜间偷袭我们的船
They attack our drones at night,

46
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,927
白天试图杀掉我们
and try to kill me during the day.

47
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,244
没完没了 不知道为什么
There's still fight in them, but I don't know why.

Vika can't wait to go. Me, I'm not so sure.

55
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,122
我也说不清楚 我无法抹去对地球的感觉
I can't shake the feeling that Earth,

56
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,402
尽管已无法挽回

The ball is snapped,

But this QB runs back, and picks up his own fumble.

150

Hold on, what did you just do?

151
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,411
对方球员像一面墙压过来
There's a wall of linebackers closing in on him.

152
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,201
他把球扔了出去 也不管谁能接到
So, he throws a long ball with no idea who is at the other end.

153
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,044

982
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:34,529
- 你快进入休眠舱 - 我不能丢下你
I want you back there now. Absolutely not.

983
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:35,761
这是命令
That's an order!

984
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:37,041
杰克 我不会离开你的
Jack, no, we're a team.

985
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:02,405
动作快点 杰克 还有30秒
<font color="#808080">VICTORIA:</font> We've got to go, Jack! 30 seconds!

986
01:49:05,160 --> 01:49:07,731
做个好梦
Dream of us.

987
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:11,210
<font color="#D900D9">(ALARM CONTINUES)</font>

988
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:49,361
杰克
Jack...

989
01:49:50,630 --> 01:49:52,000
（录音播放完毕）

990
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:08,888
49号 准备全速推进
<font color="#808080">SALLY:</font> Tech-49, enter at headway speed.

991
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:12,287
全速推进
Entering at headway.

992
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:29,646
精神点  鲍勃
<font color="#D900D9">(WHISPERS)</font> You buck up, Bob.

993
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,321
别在那儿哆哆嗦嗦的
Don't go all shaky on me.

994
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:09,124
杰克 我好像注意到
<font color="#808080">SALLY:</font> Jack, I can't help notice

995
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:13,001
你的呼吸和心率都在加快
your respiration and heart rate have increased.

996
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:16,320
终于能跟你见面 使我非常激动
I'm just excited to finally meet you, Sally.

997
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:21,526
你的这种反常现象 最近经常出现
There's been a pattern of insubordinate behavior recently.

998
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:24,086
是啊
Yeah.

999
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:26,523
我感到非常抱歉
I feel bad about that.

1000
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:31,520
音频分析显示你在说谎 杰克
Voice analysis indicates you are lying to me, Jack.

1001
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:33,489
告诉我你来的目的
Tell me why you are here.

1002
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:35,290
五秒钟内回答我
You have five seconds.

1003
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:44,562
我想让茱莉娅活下来
I want Julia to live.

1004
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,685
我想让人类生存下来
I want our species to survive.

1005
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:52,688
这是唯一的办法
This is the only way.

1006
01:51:58,360 --> 01:52:02,206
请准备降落 已提供正常氧气
Proceed to landing. Atmosphere provided.

1007
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:03,523
欢迎回家 杰克
Welcome home, Jack.

1008
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:17,481
来吧
Come on.

1009
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:20,524
杰克 你的决定很正确
Jack, you're doing the right thing.

1010
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:24,402
我不知道你是什么 从什么地方来的
<font color="#808080">JACK:</font> I don't know what you are, or where you're from,

1011
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:29,289
我想告诉你 我看过的
but I'd like to tell you about something I read.

1012
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:33,369
一个故事 讲的是罗马
A story from Rome,

1013
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:36,840
一个毁灭了的城市
a city you destroyed.

1014
01:53:37,680 --> 01:53:39,364
故事很经典
It's a classic.

1015
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:43,369
有个家伙 叫贺雷修斯
There was a guy, Horatius,

1016
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:47,369
一个人在桥上抵抗整支军队
held the bridge alone against a whole army.

1017
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:50,000
当时贺雷修斯说了一句话
And what Horatius said was,

1018
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:52,208
究竟怎样才算死得其所
"How can a man die better..."

1019
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:56,968
你是不会死的 杰克 她也不会死
You don't have to die, Jack. She doesn't have to die.

1020
01:53:57,120 --> 01:53:59,521
所有人都会死 萨莉
Everybody dies, Sally.

1021
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:01,364
但要死得其所
The thing is, to die well.

1022
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:14,883
杰克 这不是你之前跟我说过的幸存者
Jack, that's not the survivor you promised me.

1023
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:17,642
对 不是那个
No, it's not.

1024
01:54:40,160 --> 01:54:43,881
贺雷修斯说的是
What Horatius said was,

1025
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:47,044
究竟怎样才算死得其所
"How can a man die better"

1026
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:52,567
而不用面对死亡的恐惧
<font color="#808080">JACK:</font> "Than facing fearful odds"

1027
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:56,328
无人机 快进来
Drones! Get inside! Get inside!

1028
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:58,164
莫过于为了祖先的足迹
<font color="#808080">JACK:</font> "For the ashes of his fathers"

1029
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:03,771
和自己信仰的圣殿
"And the temples of his Gods"

1030
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:07,448
是我创造了你 杰克
<font color="#808080">SALLY:</font> I created you, Jack.

1031
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:09,682
我就是你的信仰
I am your God.

1032
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:23,764
你去死吧 萨莉
Fuck you, Sally.

1033
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:20,161
地球 大战之后
<font color="#808080">JACK:</font> Earth, after the war.

1034
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:24,282
距离上次见你已经整整三年了
Three years have passed since I saw your face.

1035
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:29,566
不知道该不该去找你 在夜里 在梦里
I wonder if I come to you at night, in dreams.

1036
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:33,967
在白天 在记忆里
In the day, as memories.

1037
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:38,966
你是否会想起我 就像我想起你一样
Do I haunt your hours the way you haunted mine?

1038
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:42,925
当你看到她的时候
And I wonder if you see me

1039
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:45,250
能看到我吗
when you look at her.

1040
01:56:57,400 --> 01:56:59,323
妈妈 看
Mommy, look.

1041
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:09,168
如果我们有灵魂 那是我们的爱铸就的
If we have souls, they are made of the love we share.

1042
01:57:12,640 --> 01:57:15,007
永不消散
Undimmed by time.

1043
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:18,401
至死不渝
Unbound by death.

1044
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:39,641
这三年来 我一直在找他建的房子
For three years, I searched for the house he built.

1045
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:42,931
我知道一定在什么地方
I knew it had to be out there.

1046
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:49,161
因为我了解他
Because I know him.

1047
01:57:56,920 --> 01:57:58,922
我就是他
I am him.

1048
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:02,321
他是谁
Who's that?

1049
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:13,086
我是杰克·哈珀
I am Jack Harper.

1050
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:17,171
我终于回家了
And I am home.
