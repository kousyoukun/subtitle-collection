1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074
Enjoy the flick. Cheers. vR ;)

2
00:03:42,059 --> 00:03:44,016
Sick call!

3
00:04:10,504 --> 00:04:12,461
Forward.

4
00:04:14,174 --> 00:04:17,839
A Troop, forward right, yo-ho!

5
00:04:19,221 --> 00:04:21,178
Forward right, yo-ho!

6
00:04:22,307 --> 00:04:23,636
Halt!

7
00:04:26,353 --> 00:04:30,185
- Gentlemen, congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

8
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,150
The Indian scouts...

9
00:04:37,989 --> 00:04:41,654
When you're dismissed,
walk your horses for half an hour,

10
00:04:41,868 --> 00:04:44,359
then water and picket them.

11
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:48,909
The sutler's store will remain open
until 12 o'clock.

12
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:52,708
- Have some beer.
- We thank the colonel.

13
00:04:52,921 --> 00:04:55,672
That's a fine idea.

14
00:04:56,758 --> 00:04:59,047
Officers post. Gallop.

15
00:05:04,057 --> 00:05:06,346
Prepare to dismount!

16
00:05:07,018 --> 00:05:08,975
Dismount!

17
00:05:42,595 --> 00:05:45,679
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.

18
00:05:47,058 --> 00:05:49,097
Good evening, sir.

19
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:55,720
- Have a cup of your own coffee, York?
- I've been thinking of nothing else.

20
00:05:55,942 --> 00:05:58,479
- Tough, huh?
- Tough, sir.

21
00:06:00,196 --> 00:06:06,316
I haven't had a cup of duty coffee with
you since we rode down to Shenandoah.

22
00:06:06,535 --> 00:06:08,991
15 years ago, isn't it?

23
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:13,333
15 years, two months, seven days.

24
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,422
- How did you fare on patrol?
- Had a running fight for 30-odd miles.

25
00:06:21,634 --> 00:06:24,303
We captured Naches, their chief,

26
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:29,470
eight others before the Apaches reached
the Rio Grande and crossed into Mexico.

27
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:34,345
Pursuant to orders,
I halted on our side of the river.

28
00:06:34,563 --> 00:06:39,308
- Men didn't like it very much.
- Neither did you. And neither do I.

29
00:06:39,526 --> 00:06:43,856
But that's the policy. Soldiers
don't make policy. They carry it out.

30
00:06:44,073 --> 00:06:49,826
- State Department could do something.
- They'll write a sharp note of protest.

31
00:06:50,037 --> 00:06:53,203
If you care to read
sharp notes of protest...

32
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:58,373
I'll declaim them over the graves
of the troopers guarding the waterholes.

33
00:06:58,587 --> 00:07:01,671
Three of them
staked face-down on anthills.

34
00:07:01,882 --> 00:07:05,417
You've got the dirtiest job in the army.
No doubt of that, Kirby.

35
00:07:05,636 --> 00:07:12,089
- I'm not complaining. I get paid for it.
- Maybe you should complain. I'll listen.

36
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:16,889
This coffee isn't as good as it used to be.

37
00:07:17,105 --> 00:07:19,228
I'll make a note of that.

38
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:24,687
But maybe someday
it'll get better and stronger.

39
00:07:24,905 --> 00:07:27,692
I'll drink to that, sir. Stronger.

40
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,944
Too bad about your son.

41
00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:41,168
- I hadn't heard.
- I'm sorry, Kirby. I thought you knew.

42
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:46,504
He failed mathematics at West Point.
They dropped him from the academy.

43
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:51,505
- Indeed?
- It's no disgrace failing mathematics.

44
00:07:51,723 --> 00:07:54,807
I missed it myself
by the skin of my teeth.

45
00:07:55,018 --> 00:07:58,351
I haven't seen my son in 15 years.

46
00:07:58,563 --> 00:08:04,067
Yes, I know. It's... Well, Kirby,
this coffee is weak but it's all we have.

47
00:08:04,277 --> 00:08:07,728
- More?
- If it's all we have.

48
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:30,046
Knock it off, knock it off.

49
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:33,094
Left face.

50
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:37,350
Aye, you're a fine body of men.
Now put your bags down.

51
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,845
This is your home,
so make yourselves comfortable.

52
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:48,403
Aye. I bid you all welcome to Fort Starke,
recruits that you are.

53
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:51,946
But in no time at all, you'll be soldiers.

54
00:08:52,158 --> 00:08:58,362
Sure. Why, in less than six months,
with good behaviour and hard work,

55
00:08:58,581 --> 00:09:01,997
you'll be wearing yellow stripes
on your breeches.

56
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:08,088
Would you mind
putting your cap on your head?

57
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:10,968
No, not at all, Doc.

58
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,303
Did any of yous ever ride a horse?

59
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:17,974
Yeah, some.

60
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:24,978
Now answer the roll-call.

61
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,349
- Adams.
- Present.

62
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,228
- Boone.
- Yes, sir?

63
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:31,900
- Boone.
- Yeah?

64
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,315
Just say "yo".

65
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:37,610
Yo.

66
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,405
Carol. Dirks.

67
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:42,952
Dark. Eaton.

68
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,661
Fragman. Goodwin.

69
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,581
Hegginsmith. Heinze. Dibbs.

70
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,539
Murphy. O'Toole.

71
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,215
Perkins. Selby.

72
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:55,420
- Tyree. York.
- Present, sir.

73
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,948
All right, pick up your bags.

74
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,867
Left face.

75
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,124
As you were, Sergeant.

76
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:41,470
I don't want you men to be fooled
about what's coming up for you.

77
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,352
Torture. At least that.

78
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,721
The war department
promised me 180 men.

79
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,234
They sent me 18, all told.
You are the 18.

80
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:58,062
So each one of you
will have to do the work of 10 men.

81
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:02,991
If you fail, I'll have you
spreadeagled on a wagon wheel.

82
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:09,072
If you desert, you'll be found.
Tracked down and broken into bits.

83
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,330
- That is all.
- Forward!

84
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,676
Trooper York, sir.

85
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,155
I haven't seen you for 15 years.

86
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,649
So I've been told, sir.
I have no clear memory.

87
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,572
You proved that
when you failed at West Point.

88
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,741
- Yes, sir.
- Where did you enlist?

89
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:52,120
- At Highland Falls, sir, next day.
- Lied about your age.

90
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:55,835
- Recruit training?
- Jefferson Barracks, sir.

91
00:11:57,424 --> 00:12:00,840
Well, on the official records,
you're my son.

92
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,137
But on this post
you're just another trooper.

93
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:08,013
You heard me tell the recruits
what I need from them.

94
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,385
Twice that I will expect from you.

95
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:16,477
At Chapultepec
my father - your grandfather -

96
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:19,813
shot for cowardice
the son of a US senator.

97
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,648
That was his duty. I will do mine.

98
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:30,486
You've chosen my way of life.
I hope you have the guts to endure it.

99
00:12:30,707 --> 00:12:35,369
But put out of your mind any
romantic ideas that it's a way of glory.

100
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:38,208
It's a life of suffering and of hardship

101
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:42,670
and uncompromising devotion
to your oath and your duty.

102
00:12:42,886 --> 00:12:46,172
- Have I permission to speak?
- Within proper limits.

103
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:51,764
I didn't ask to come to this regiment, but
I wouldn't have it otherwise now I'm here.

104
00:12:51,978 --> 00:12:55,312
- May I also put something straight?
- Proceed.

105
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,145
I'm not in this post to call you Father.

106
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,357
I was ordered here as Trooper
Jefferson York of the US Cavalry.

107
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:06,985
- That is all I wish to be, sir.
- Then we understand each other.

108
00:13:07,202 --> 00:13:10,156
- We do, sir.
- Sergeant Major.

109
00:13:11,122 --> 00:13:15,334
The recruits are for field duty
as of now. Dismissed.

110
00:13:15,543 --> 00:13:17,501
Trooper York.

111
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,927
- What are you waiting for?
- For the salute to be returned.

112
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:28,719
- Military regulations, sir.
- Quincannon.

113
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:18,604
- Once again, and faster!
- Up a notch. Give him a good jump.

114
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,194
Do you see how easy it is?
When I was a young man like yourselves

115
00:14:25,404 --> 00:14:30,196
I could jump nine feet tall,
and with an Indian under each arm.

116
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:32,366
What tribe?

117
00:14:35,372 --> 00:14:38,124
Once again, and faster.

118
00:14:38,334 --> 00:14:40,741
Horsemen.

119
00:14:46,592 --> 00:14:51,633
Appears to me they make a lot of fuss
jumping a horse over some sticks.

120
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:53,306
Yo.

121
00:14:53,515 --> 00:14:59,102
- That's a six-foot jump, Travis.
- Now, keep 'em ahead. Now over.

122
00:14:59,313 --> 00:15:04,271
You see? That gives you an idea what
horsemanship is like in the US Cavalry.

123
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:07,485
Now, after that comes the Roman teams.

124
00:15:07,696 --> 00:15:12,524
That's easy. It's the way the Romans
used to ride, the ancient Romans.

125
00:15:12,743 --> 00:15:15,993
Standing up. Standing up.

126
00:15:16,204 --> 00:15:17,996
Yo.

127
00:15:19,082 --> 00:15:22,036
Slim. Upsy-daisy.

128
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:42,559
Mister? What time do you blow the horn
around here for folks to eat?

129
00:15:55,201 --> 00:15:58,286
You think you'd like to try that
before you eat?

130
00:15:58,496 --> 00:16:01,581
You mean ride
like them ancient Romans?

131
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,831
- Yes.
- Yo.

132
00:16:04,753 --> 00:16:06,792
Let's go, Sandy!

133
00:16:40,288 --> 00:16:42,161
Come on, Sandy!

134
00:16:49,964 --> 00:16:52,003
Easy, now! Easy!

135
00:16:59,098 --> 00:17:02,384
Horsemen! Oh, boyo, horsemen!

136
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:14,730
- Nice team, Corporal.
- That the general idea, Doc?

137
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:16,987
That's the general idea.

138
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,656
But before I'm through with yous, you'll
take them jumps backwards. Is there...?

139
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,700
The marshal wants to make a check.

140
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:33,047
He thinks perhaps this man
might be among our new recruits.

141
00:17:38,554 --> 00:17:42,053
Anybody by the name of Tyree
among your horse thieves?

142
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:45,765
- Horse thieves, is it now?
- That's what I said.

143
00:17:45,978 --> 00:17:49,062
They're wearing the uniform
of the US Cavalry.

144
00:17:49,273 --> 00:17:54,267
Fella I'm looking for is from Texas.
Wanted for questioning about a killing.

145
00:17:56,113 --> 00:18:00,241
- Is there a man from Texas?
- Yes, sir. I'm from Texas.

146
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,404
Name of Boone. Daniel Boone.

147
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,156
Daniel Boone?

148
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:10,328
That name's kinda familiar, ain't it, Mink?

149
00:18:20,053 --> 00:18:23,837
Name's Tyree. A $50 reward.

150
00:18:24,057 --> 00:18:28,102
- Right tidy sum.
- Tyree. Nobody here by that name.

151
00:18:28,311 --> 00:18:33,353
Sergeant, be taking the marshals
and give them a wee drop of comfort.

152
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:37,979
- Who's gonna pay for that liquor?
- The sergeant'll pay for it.

153
00:18:38,196 --> 00:18:43,273
Horse thieves we don't have here.
But horsemen I'll make of yous yet.

154
00:18:43,493 --> 00:18:45,450
Yo.

155
00:18:49,207 --> 00:18:54,711
Anyone else like to try the jumps after
the manner of the ancient Romans?

156
00:18:54,921 --> 00:18:57,210
Yes, sir. I would.

157
00:19:04,264 --> 00:19:06,719
Get it done, Johnny Reb.

158
00:19:10,144 --> 00:19:12,184
Get up on them!

159
00:19:24,117 --> 00:19:27,320
You'll get busted for this, Quincannon.

160
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:42,216
Get your hat. You all right, boy?

161
00:19:42,426 --> 00:19:44,253
Yeah.

162
00:19:55,606 --> 00:19:59,438
Now cover them well
and cool them off, men.

163
00:19:59,652 --> 00:20:03,899
In six months, we'll have
the finest drill team in the world.

164
00:20:12,748 --> 00:20:14,705
Come here.

165
00:20:20,381 --> 00:20:22,338
Break it up!

166
00:20:24,093 --> 00:20:26,050
Break it up!

167
00:20:26,261 --> 00:20:28,634
Break it up, I tell you.

168
00:20:28,847 --> 00:20:30,887
Let 'em fight.

169
00:20:31,975 --> 00:20:34,513
Now, what started this fight?

170
00:20:34,728 --> 00:20:38,429
- I refuse to answer, sir.
- Go ahead. Tell him, Reb.

171
00:20:39,525 --> 00:20:42,858
This fella here spoke real derogatory
about the boy's pappy.

172
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:47,696
He said he was the teacher's pet
of a chowder-headed Mick sergeant.

173
00:20:47,908 --> 00:20:50,363
What's that mean, Doc?

174
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:56,244
- Did you say that?
- Yes, I did.

175
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,497
- You did, did you?
- Yes, I did.

176
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:02,245
- Did you mean it, did you?
- Yes, I did.

177
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,547
We'll settle this tonight behind
the picket lines. Soldier fashion.

178
00:21:09,763 --> 00:21:12,254
Marquess of Queensberry Rules.

179
00:21:12,474 --> 00:21:15,558
Chowdered-face... Chow...
What was it he said?

180
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:19,980
- Chowder-headed Mick sergeant.
- Chowdered-headed Mick...

181
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,229
- And you meant it?
- Yes.

182
00:21:22,442 --> 00:21:24,731
Nine o'clock tonight, boys.

183
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,199
Get it done, Johnny Reb.

184
00:22:01,564 --> 00:22:04,137
Come on, boy!

185
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:17,741
Pull him up. Put some water on him.

186
00:22:17,955 --> 00:22:21,787
- You're winning. Like a mountain lion.
- You're doin' good.

187
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:25,833
But don't forget to keep your left up.
Twist it like this.

188
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:30,424
- You're doing good.
- You'll get busted for this, Quincannon.

189
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:36,172
You're doin' all right, but use that right.
Keep throwing that right in there.

190
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,430
Hit him with the right.

191
00:22:38,642 --> 00:22:43,850
It's a lovely fight, Heinze,
but watch them fouls. None of that.

192
00:22:44,064 --> 00:22:47,599
And when you come out of the clinches,
none of that.

193
00:23:11,967 --> 00:23:14,802
Well, Quincannon? Talk fast.

194
00:23:15,012 --> 00:23:18,297
- Soldiers' fight, sir.
- What caused it?

195
00:23:18,515 --> 00:23:21,801
I refuse to answer, sir. Respectfully, sir.

196
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:27,564
- Heinze?
- I refuse to answer, sir.

197
00:23:30,402 --> 00:23:32,359
York?

198
00:23:32,863 --> 00:23:34,820
No, sir.

199
00:23:44,332 --> 00:23:47,002
Soldiers' fight, eh?

200
00:23:49,379 --> 00:23:51,621
Carry on.

201
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:58,502
You heard what the colonel said.
Carry on with the fight.

202
00:23:59,097 --> 00:24:01,137
Thanks, Heinze.

203
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,643
- Sorry, soldier.
- I apologise.

204
00:24:08,231 --> 00:24:12,774
Now, sonny, let me have a look
at that eye. You'll be all right.

205
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,417
You little rascal. It's the left
you should have been watching. The left.

206
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:32,543
The left like that.

207
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:05,367
Good morning, sonny.

208
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:12,082
Why, that's castor oil.

209
00:25:44,994 --> 00:25:47,864
Two hours and 20 minutes late.

210
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,541
Whoa.

211
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:55,622
That's the colonel's quarters, ma'am.

212
00:25:55,838 --> 00:26:00,879
Well, Trunkett. When did you
take unto yourself a wife?

213
00:26:01,468 --> 00:26:03,425
I ain't yet.

214
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:10,638
Beggin' your pardon, but unauthorised
ladies are not permitted on this post.

215
00:26:10,853 --> 00:26:16,855
I am not unauthorised.
I am Trooper Jefferson York's mother.

216
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:22,228
I... I'm afraid
we have no accommodations...

217
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:26,362
...no quarters for mothers
of the enlisted men.

218
00:26:26,576 --> 00:26:29,661
I have a pass
signed by General Sheridan.

219
00:26:30,706 --> 00:26:32,994
May I help you, ma'am?

220
00:27:09,911 --> 00:27:13,161
- I'll handle this, Captain.
- Thank you, sir.

221
00:27:15,792 --> 00:27:18,247
Good evening, Kathleen.

222
00:27:20,255 --> 00:27:22,710
Good evening, Kirby.

223
00:27:25,301 --> 00:27:30,592
Sergeant, see that Mrs York's bags
are unloaded and taken to my quarters.

224
00:27:30,807 --> 00:27:32,764
Yes, sir.

225
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:42,813
Welcome home, darling.

226
00:27:45,238 --> 00:27:48,108
I see you still have that arsonist with you.

227
00:27:48,324 --> 00:27:54,160
If you mean Quincannon,
he is a sergeant major in the US Army.

228
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:58,072
Anything he may have done
long ago in the line of duty,

229
00:27:58,292 --> 00:28:00,581
he did in obedience to my orders.

230
00:28:00,795 --> 00:28:03,582
- Reluctantly, I may add.
- Oh.

231
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,880
The reluctant arsonist.

232
00:28:24,568 --> 00:28:29,277
The safest way to start our conversation
would be for you to just say,

233
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:32,574
"To what do I owe the honour
of your visit?"

234
00:28:32,785 --> 00:28:35,454
I saw the reason for your visit today.

235
00:28:35,663 --> 00:28:39,707
- How is he?
- He's grown considerably, I thought.

236
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:43,286
Right now he's bruised up a little.
Had a fight.

237
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:46,291
A fight? With another soldier?

238
00:28:46,507 --> 00:28:48,795
Hardly an officer.

239
00:28:49,009 --> 00:28:53,636
Hardly with an officer.
He's not gentleman enough for that.

240
00:28:53,847 --> 00:28:56,255
Soldier - that's enough for me.

241
00:28:56,475 --> 00:29:02,180
Not for me. Jeff was boyishly ashamed
when he was expelled from West Point.

242
00:29:02,397 --> 00:29:06,525
He shouldn't have enlisted.
I could have sent him to Lexington.

243
00:29:06,735 --> 00:29:10,104
He could have tutored in mathematics
and got his commission.

244
00:29:10,322 --> 00:29:14,236
But he did enlist and he's here.

245
00:29:15,327 --> 00:29:18,032
Here he'll stay and here he'll serve.

246
00:29:18,246 --> 00:29:22,161
Ramrod, wreckage and ruin!
Still the same Kirby.

247
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:27,203
Special privilege to special born.
Still the same Kathleen.

248
00:29:28,632 --> 00:29:32,001
Kirby, I've come to take Jeff home.

249
00:29:32,219 --> 00:29:35,303
He signed enlistment papers.
He took an oath.

250
00:29:35,513 --> 00:29:38,633
Oath! Jeff can be
released from the army,

251
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:42,136
bought off honourably
for the sum of $100.

252
00:29:42,354 --> 00:29:45,557
I brought that amount with me
in Yankee gold.

253
00:29:45,774 --> 00:29:48,858
You forget one
very important detail, Kathleen.

254
00:29:49,069 --> 00:29:53,197
Such a release requires my signature
as commanding officer.

255
00:29:56,242 --> 00:29:59,611
You've overlooked
several other important details.

256
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:03,115
Number one:
you're a fine figure of a woman.

257
00:30:08,588 --> 00:30:11,458
Number two: you probably haven't eaten.

258
00:30:11,674 --> 00:30:16,632
There's a box of silver in that chest.
I'll send someone over to set the table.

259
00:30:16,846 --> 00:30:20,049
- You will dine with me?
- Of course.

260
00:32:10,834 --> 00:32:12,910
The regimental singers.

261
00:32:14,713 --> 00:32:17,998
Probably to serenade you.

262
00:32:19,217 --> 00:32:22,467
That is... very gracious of them.

263
00:32:56,879 --> 00:33:00,165
- With Mrs York's permission.
- Thank you.

264
00:33:03,261 --> 00:33:12,893
I'll take you home again, Kathleen

265
00:33:15,106 --> 00:33:22,069
Across the ocean wild and wide

266
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:32,365
To where your heart has ever been

267
00:33:36,293 --> 00:33:44,918
Since first you were my blushing bride

268
00:33:48,055 --> 00:33:57,688
The roses all have left your cheeks

269
00:34:01,026 --> 00:34:09,034
I watched them fade away and die

270
00:34:09,243 --> 00:34:12,528
This music is not of my choosing.

271
00:34:15,082 --> 00:34:17,454
I'm sorry, Kirby.

272
00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:20,123
I wish it had been.

273
00:34:25,968 --> 00:34:34,806
And tears bedim your loving eye

274
00:34:39,106 --> 00:34:46,022
I will take you back, Kathleen

275
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:56,578
To where your heart will feel no pain

276
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:06,498
And when the fields are fresh and green

277
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:13,670
I'll take you

278
00:35:15,517 --> 00:35:25,482
To your home again

279
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:44,709
- Goodnight, Kathleen. Sleep well.
- I'm sorry to dispossess you.

280
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:49,753
I dispossessed you
more forcibly 15 years ago.

281
00:35:51,844 --> 00:35:54,679
You've grown more thoughtful.

282
00:35:55,765 --> 00:35:57,841
Pleasant dreams.

283
00:36:01,854 --> 00:36:03,811
Goodnight, Kathleen.

284
00:36:30,633 --> 00:36:33,752
- Who's that?
- Sergeant Major Quincannon, ma'am.

285
00:37:50,712 --> 00:37:52,835
Johnny!

286
00:37:53,048 --> 00:37:56,630
Sergeant, tell them Indians
to stop that yowling.

287
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:07,221
And make them put them fires out!

288
00:38:11,983 --> 00:38:15,067
Would you like to have me
carry you across?

289
00:38:15,278 --> 00:38:17,021
I would not!

290
00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:09,497
What was that verse you used
to sing about the Alamo?

291
00:39:17,089 --> 00:39:19,046
Trooper York.

292
00:39:43,866 --> 00:39:47,151
Fellas, this is my mother.

293
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:49,990
I'm deeply honoured, ma'am.

294
00:39:50,205 --> 00:39:54,155
- Glad to make your acquaintance.
- Howdy, ma'am.

295
00:40:12,853 --> 00:40:15,688
You don't have to hide your bruises, Jeff.

296
00:40:15,897 --> 00:40:18,982
Your father told me all about them.

297
00:40:38,587 --> 00:40:41,256
What kind of man is he, Mother?

298
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:48,259
He's a lonely man.

299
00:40:50,306 --> 00:40:52,595
He's a very lonely man.

300
00:40:54,394 --> 00:40:56,885
They say he's a great soldier.

301
00:40:57,981 --> 00:41:00,020
I suppose he is, but...

302
00:41:01,484 --> 00:41:05,352
...what makes soldiers great
is hateful to me.

303
00:41:10,827 --> 00:41:13,496
I've come to take you home, Jeff.

304
00:41:15,456 --> 00:41:18,541
I can't leave, Mother. It'd be quitting.

305
00:41:23,297 --> 00:41:26,631
You're stubborn and proud, Jeff.

306
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:29,758
Just like he is.

307
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,599
Just like you are, Mother.

308
00:41:38,771 --> 00:41:41,523
- I'll buy you out.
- No.

309
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:46,105
I failed at West Point.

310
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,274
I'm gonna work this out my own way.

311
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:59,073
I'll take you home as soon as
your father signs your papers.

312
00:42:01,335 --> 00:42:04,419
Maybe they didn't tell you, Mother,

313
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:08,628
but the application
requires my signature, too.

314
00:42:10,636 --> 00:42:13,092
I refuse to sign it.

315
00:42:32,825 --> 00:42:36,240
I'd like to... Them blasted coyotes.

316
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:39,240
What coyotes, sir?

317
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:43,454
- Them ain't coyotes, sir.
- How long have you been out West?

318
00:42:43,669 --> 00:42:47,085
Long enough to know a coyote
when I hear it, sir.

319
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,427
Watch it.

320
00:43:16,826 --> 00:43:19,496
Jeff! Jeff! Put out that light.

321
00:44:36,113 --> 00:44:38,153
Call the alarm.

322
00:44:39,617 --> 00:44:41,241
Yes, sir.

323
00:44:43,496 --> 00:44:47,078
This is an attack, Prescott.
Order a skirmish.

324
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:51,241
Skirmishers! Follow me!

325
00:45:15,861 --> 00:45:18,778
Uncle Timmy! Uncle Timmy!

326
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:15,574
- How's Mrs York?
- Mrs York is not in her quarters.

327
00:46:39,986 --> 00:46:44,980
Trooper York, take your mother
back to her quarters.

328
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:46,528
Yes, sir.

329
00:46:51,164 --> 00:46:54,248
I will see you later, Captain.

330
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,557
Chiricahua.

331
00:47:13,477 --> 00:47:15,020
Mescalero.

332
00:47:17,773 --> 00:47:19,730
Chiricahua.

333
00:47:20,693 --> 00:47:22,650
Mescalero.

334
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:33,327
White Mountain.

335
00:47:34,081 --> 00:47:36,537
They've concentrated three tribes.

336
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:39,787
This means real trouble, gentlemen.

337
00:47:40,921 --> 00:47:45,667
Unless we can stop them
before they cross the Rio Grande.

338
00:47:47,845 --> 00:47:51,261
Captain St Jacques,
you will form Troop A.

339
00:47:51,473 --> 00:47:55,423
Two bandoliers of ammunition
per trooper, four days' rations.

340
00:47:55,644 --> 00:47:57,684
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

341
00:47:57,896 --> 00:47:59,936
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

342
00:48:03,068 --> 00:48:05,357
Ready to move out in 30 minutes.

343
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:27,924
I suppose I'm under arrest
for being out of bounds, as you call it?

344
00:48:28,135 --> 00:48:31,967
No, but we can't have
the colonel's lady fainting

345
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:35,265
every time there's a little shooting.

346
00:48:37,352 --> 00:48:39,309
Kirby...

347
00:48:40,814 --> 00:48:42,853
I'll take them.

348
00:48:44,359 --> 00:48:46,648
Thank you.

349
00:48:48,363 --> 00:48:50,320
Attention.

350
00:49:05,255 --> 00:49:07,497
Column of twos, Captain.

351
00:49:07,715 --> 00:49:09,755
Right by twos!

352
00:49:22,105 --> 00:49:25,521
Singers! Give us a tune.

353
00:50:11,904 --> 00:50:13,944
Water, Sandy.

354
00:50:40,641 --> 00:50:43,725
- Hang these up by the feet, Sandy.
- Yo.

355
00:50:46,897 --> 00:50:49,851
- Good morning, Mrs York.
- Morning, Doctor.

356
00:50:50,067 --> 00:50:52,605
- Busy woman.
- Yes, indeed.

357
00:50:53,445 --> 00:50:57,906
- Can I help with your wash?
- I generally let one of the other ladies.

358
00:50:58,116 --> 00:51:02,944
But I'm sure the sergeant here
would like to give you his trade.

359
00:51:17,094 --> 00:51:21,222
As a doctor, I would diagnose those
as saddle-sores.

360
00:51:34,361 --> 00:51:36,768
- Trooper Tyree?
- Here, sir.

361
00:51:39,658 --> 00:51:43,821
I have a demand from the Deputy
United States Marshal to seize you.

362
00:51:44,037 --> 00:51:48,995
Under warrant issued by due
and legal process by the district court,

363
00:51:49,209 --> 00:51:54,832
"Fernando X Hernandez, judge,
on charges of manslaughter. "

364
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,299
The way that language sounds,
I must be arrested.

365
00:52:00,512 --> 00:52:05,138
As the commanding officer is not
present, you will await his signature.

366
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:10,225
Got any place I can lock this soldier boy
up till I get them papers signed?

367
00:52:10,438 --> 00:52:15,266
With a fella like this, sir, I mean,
a desperado, leave him at the hospital.

368
00:52:15,485 --> 00:52:18,189
It's a good idea.
I can get my feet checked.

369
00:52:18,404 --> 00:52:20,361
They been bothering me.

370
00:52:20,573 --> 00:52:24,820
You wanna come along peaceful
or want me to use these cuffs on you?

371
00:52:25,036 --> 00:52:29,283
I'm always peaceful,
and there ain't no use doing nothin' else.

372
00:52:29,499 --> 00:52:31,456
Excuse me, ma'am.

373
00:52:32,877 --> 00:52:35,249
Are you arresting that nice young man?

374
00:52:35,463 --> 00:52:39,211
Not me, Mrs York.
The United States Deputy Marshal.

375
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:47,347
Manslaughter! Well,
what are you going to do about it?

376
00:52:47,558 --> 00:52:53,513
A nice gentle soul who'd walk ten miles
out of his way before he'd step on an ant.

377
00:52:55,149 --> 00:52:58,233
You get him some tobacco,
anything he wants.

378
00:52:58,444 --> 00:53:00,602
And we'll also get him a lawyer.

379
00:53:00,821 --> 00:53:04,771
- He's partial to molasses candy.
- Well, get some.

380
00:53:06,869 --> 00:53:09,442
Yankee justice.

381
00:53:09,663 --> 00:53:13,198
Arresting a nice young man like that
for manslaughter.

382
00:53:13,417 --> 00:53:17,249
And promoting arsonists
to be sergeant majors!

383
00:53:21,634 --> 00:53:23,710
Uncle Timmy!

384
00:53:39,651 --> 00:53:42,605
Singers! Sing out.

385
00:53:42,821 --> 00:53:45,110
Make you forget your thirst.

386
00:54:15,228 --> 00:54:19,771
Doctor, I get spots in front of me eyes
and me heart is palpitating.

387
00:54:19,983 --> 00:54:22,022
- And I'm...
- Sitting on it.

388
00:54:22,235 --> 00:54:24,275
Thank you, Doctor.

389
00:54:41,463 --> 00:54:45,959
- I feel better now.
- It'll kill you or cure you.

390
00:54:46,176 --> 00:54:51,087
Doctor, with your fine education,
would you be telling me something?

391
00:54:51,306 --> 00:54:54,591
- Yeah.
- What is an arsonist?

392
00:54:57,145 --> 00:55:00,348
An arsonist is a person
that sets buildings on fire

393
00:55:00,565 --> 00:55:03,020
for profit or perverse excitement.

394
00:55:05,778 --> 00:55:07,818
Is that what it is?

395
00:55:10,074 --> 00:55:12,363
Why?

396
00:55:16,247 --> 00:55:20,624
It all started when we rode
down to Shenandoah Valley, Doctor.

397
00:55:20,835 --> 00:55:25,378
Every trooper of General Sheridan's
command during the late war.

398
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:31,343
It was because he'd ordered to burn
the crops and the barns at Bridesdale.

399
00:55:33,014 --> 00:55:35,884
With herself looking daggers at me.

400
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,935
And same as at the colonel.

401
00:55:39,145 --> 00:55:41,433
He was a captain then.

402
00:55:41,647 --> 00:55:44,482
Silent as death, she was,

403
00:55:44,692 --> 00:55:47,527
with a baby in her arms, little Jeff.

404
00:55:48,612 --> 00:55:50,439
Little Jeff.

405
00:55:53,075 --> 00:55:56,610
Well, it was grim duty
for both you and the colonel.

406
00:55:57,705 --> 00:56:01,749
- That was his wife's plantation?
- Aye.

407
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:05,909
It was owned by the same family
ever since that grand Irishman,

408
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:09,712
Sir Walter Raleigh, first smoked a pipe.

409
00:56:09,925 --> 00:56:12,760
Seems like I've heard that story before.

410
00:56:14,972 --> 00:56:18,720
And there's the black hand
that did the dirty deed.

411
00:56:18,934 --> 00:56:21,970
I wish you'd knock it off with that stick.

412
00:56:49,756 --> 00:56:51,713
Halt!

413
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:17,987
I make it out to be a Mexican officer
approaching to meet you, sir.

414
00:57:21,121 --> 00:57:24,205
Cool off and water your horses.

415
00:57:24,416 --> 00:57:29,124
Bugler. Honours, please.
Three flourishes.

416
00:57:57,073 --> 00:58:00,608
- Welcome to Rio Bravo.
- Buenas tardes, el teniente.

417
00:58:00,827 --> 00:58:03,199
And my respect, Senor Coronel York.

418
00:58:03,412 --> 00:58:05,868
Wish I'd reached the Rio Grande sooner.

419
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:11,752
I wish the same. It would have saved me
three brave men killed and two wounded.

420
00:58:11,963 --> 00:58:14,288
Have you medical aid for your wounded?

421
00:58:14,507 --> 00:58:16,546
Unfortunately, no.

422
00:58:17,635 --> 00:58:21,585
Tell the surgeon to bring the pack mule,
cross the Rio Grande...

423
00:58:21,806 --> 00:58:25,222
- With your permission.
- Granted with gratitude.

424
00:58:25,434 --> 00:58:29,930
...and attend our wounded comrades
on the Rio Bravo side.

425
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:34,858
- I would suggest...
- Yes, Senor Coronel?

426
00:58:35,069 --> 00:58:39,481
...Naches and his band are a scourge
to both your country and mine.

427
00:58:39,698 --> 00:58:43,945
We can catch them before
they reach their mountain stronghold.

428
00:58:44,161 --> 00:58:48,574
I would gladly place myself and my men
under your command,

429
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:51,875
if you would invite us
to join you in pursuit.

430
00:58:52,086 --> 00:58:55,371
Unfortunately, Senor Coronel,
my orders are firm.

431
00:58:55,589 --> 00:58:58,080
I must above all protect the Rio Bravo.

432
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:02,298
With three men, sir? That's courage.

433
00:59:03,722 --> 00:59:06,260
And my orders are firm also.

434
00:59:06,475 --> 00:59:09,227
I must stay on the Rio Grande side.

435
00:59:10,103 --> 00:59:14,053
My compliments
on your fidelity to duty, sir. Adios.

436
00:59:14,274 --> 00:59:17,359
I am eternally in your debt,
Senor Coronel.

437
00:59:19,154 --> 00:59:22,025
Bueno. Vamonos.

438
01:02:03,859 --> 01:02:05,898
I'm sorry, Kathleen.

439
01:02:10,407 --> 01:02:12,732
Your sense of duty again, Kirby.

440
01:02:12,951 --> 01:02:18,290
I've seen things that make my sense
of duty important. I'll take you home.

441
01:02:20,667 --> 01:02:25,329
I'm sorry your duty made you destroy
two beautiful things:

442
01:02:25,547 --> 01:02:28,085
Bridesdale and us.

443
01:02:29,384 --> 01:02:33,002
I was sorry, too, when it had to be done.
You know that.

444
01:02:34,598 --> 01:02:36,637
But you rebuilt Bridesdale.

445
01:02:37,976 --> 01:02:41,974
That was easy.
It required just physical effort.

446
01:02:42,188 --> 01:02:45,106
The other would require more?

447
01:02:46,192 --> 01:02:49,857
It would be a start if you'd let Jeff go.

448
01:02:50,071 --> 01:02:52,194
And get you back?

449
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:58,864
If that were a condition.

450
01:03:00,748 --> 01:03:04,532
I could say yes to you
very easily, Kathleen.

451
01:03:04,752 --> 01:03:09,331
But I owe Jeff something.
He's a fine boy.

452
01:03:09,549 --> 01:03:12,716
But he must learn
that a man's word to anything,

453
01:03:12,927 --> 01:03:17,007
even his own destruction,
must be honoured.

454
01:03:41,664 --> 01:03:45,247
Good evening, York.
How about a cup of coffee?

455
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,375
General.

456
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:55,756
To your very good health, sir.

457
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:05,430
To the President of the United States.

458
01:04:11,986 --> 01:04:15,437
Perhaps Mrs York will favour us
with a sentiment.

459
01:04:19,118 --> 01:04:21,443
To my only rival.

460
01:04:21,662 --> 01:04:24,698
The United States Cavalry.

461
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:01,064
Sir, the traditional singers
would like to sing...

462
01:05:01,284 --> 01:05:05,578
- The regimental singers.
- Just what I was going to say, sir.

463
01:05:05,789 --> 01:05:10,415
The regimental singers would like to sing
a traditional song for himself.

464
01:05:10,627 --> 01:05:12,833
Very good, Quincannon.

465
01:05:13,046 --> 01:05:15,003
Carry on.

466
01:05:17,759 --> 01:05:20,511
Donnelly, sing it.

467
01:07:26,595 --> 01:07:32,016
Thank you, men. Allow them the privilege
of the sutler's store until midnight.

468
01:07:32,226 --> 01:07:34,384
We thank the general.

469
01:07:34,603 --> 01:07:37,972
Now, don't abuse the privilege. Men.

470
01:07:44,738 --> 01:07:47,988
- Goodnight, General.
- Why, you're not...

471
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,572
May we walk with you to your quarters?

472
01:07:50,786 --> 01:07:53,324
- Thank you.
- Goodnight, Mrs York.

473
01:07:53,538 --> 01:07:55,495
Goodnight, sir.

474
01:08:10,555 --> 01:08:13,971
If that marshal's here,
I'll sign those papers now.

475
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:19,307
Did you hear that music?
That sweet, lilting music.

476
01:08:19,522 --> 01:08:22,607
You blasted policeman,
get to the colonel's office

477
01:08:22,817 --> 01:08:24,857
and get your papers signed.

478
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:28,023
And take this poor boy with you.

479
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:31,739
No hard feelings, son.
Protect my interests, Doc.

480
01:08:31,951 --> 01:08:35,201
- Yeah.
- Protect my interests!

481
01:08:38,041 --> 01:08:41,042
Protect my... interests.

482
01:08:44,088 --> 01:08:47,338
Hey, son, do you know
that man has a warrant

483
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:50,219
charging you with manslaughter?

484
01:08:52,013 --> 01:08:55,963
A lot of people use that word
"manslaughter" pretty freely.

485
01:08:56,184 --> 01:09:00,395
Boy, why don't you tell us about this?
Maybe we can help you.

486
01:09:01,481 --> 01:09:07,353
Well, it could be that a fella had a run-in
with a Yankee down in Texas.

487
01:09:08,696 --> 01:09:12,741
Somethin' about the fella's... sister.

488
01:09:14,452 --> 01:09:18,580
It could be that the Yankee
drawed a gun and started shootin',

489
01:09:18,789 --> 01:09:21,541
got himself killed.

490
01:09:21,751 --> 01:09:25,583
Mrs York wants to get you a lawyer
to get you out of this.

491
01:09:25,796 --> 01:09:28,881
Thank her kindly for me and tell her...

492
01:09:29,967 --> 01:09:35,174
Look, fellas, my sister's gettin' married
to a man she grew up with.

493
01:09:35,389 --> 01:09:38,556
A Texican. Fine fella.

494
01:09:40,394 --> 01:09:44,439
They kinda plan on goin' to California
and startin' fresh.

495
01:09:45,941 --> 01:09:52,904
And I don't think it's quite right to start
a lot of talk and scandal in open court

496
01:09:53,115 --> 01:09:56,151
until their dust has settled behind them.

497
01:09:56,368 --> 01:09:58,575
Well, that makes sense to me.

498
01:09:58,787 --> 01:10:01,872
Of course, when I hear
they're in California,

499
01:10:02,082 --> 01:10:05,167
I'll be wantin' that lawyer,
wantin' him bad.

500
01:10:06,545 --> 01:10:09,795
Tell you the truth,
I kinda like this man's army.

501
01:10:11,008 --> 01:10:15,255
Thank you for your kindness.
Let's get her done, Sergeant.

502
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:20,428
If that boy was one of my troopers,
I wouldn't be so eager to see him hung.

503
01:10:24,438 --> 01:10:27,142
I'll just take a little sup for me cold.

504
01:10:28,233 --> 01:10:31,187
And then I'll take it to the colonel's tent.

505
01:10:31,403 --> 01:10:36,314
Unless you're a blackguard,
steal a horse, stay away for a few days.

506
01:10:39,619 --> 01:10:41,992
Come in!

507
01:10:48,545 --> 01:10:52,673
"Demand from the Deputy US Marshal
to seize one Travis Tyree"

508
01:10:52,883 --> 01:10:56,133
"under warrant issued
by due legal process... "

509
01:11:09,023 --> 01:11:13,187
Mrs York, I believe,
has become interested in the case.

510
01:11:13,403 --> 01:11:17,353
She's written a lawyer in Dallas
to represent him.

511
01:11:17,574 --> 01:11:24,786
Well, if a... Dallas lawyer can't get
a man off a charge of manslaughter...

512
01:11:33,339 --> 01:11:35,296
Who's there?

513
01:11:43,891 --> 01:11:47,011
Hey! Corporal of the guard!

514
01:11:47,812 --> 01:11:49,851
- My horse!
- Yes, sir.

515
01:11:51,774 --> 01:11:57,065
I sacrificed the happiness of your home
once, Kirby, to the needs of war.

516
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:02,574
Now I'll probably ruin your army career.

517
01:12:04,954 --> 01:12:09,082
I'm gonna issue an order
and give it to you personally.

518
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:14,499
I want you to cross the Rio Grande,
hit the Apache and burn 'em out.

519
01:12:14,714 --> 01:12:19,755
I'm tired of hit-and-run.
I'm sick of diplomatic hide-and-seek.

520
01:12:23,931 --> 01:12:28,059
Strip the camp of the women
and children. Send them to Fort Bliss.

521
01:12:28,269 --> 01:12:33,855
Be prepared to remain all winter.
All next winter, if necessary.

522
01:12:34,942 --> 01:12:40,102
I've waited a long time for that order, sir,
which, of course, I didn't hear.

523
01:12:40,322 --> 01:12:42,778
Of course you didn't hear it.

524
01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:49,455
If you fail, I assure you,
the members of your court martial

525
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:53,081
will be the men who rode with us
down to Shenandoah.

526
01:12:53,293 --> 01:12:56,164
I'll hand-pick 'em myself.

527
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:58,337
Shenandoah.

528
01:12:59,466 --> 01:13:03,795
I wonder what history will say
about Shenandoah.

529
01:13:05,055 --> 01:13:08,305
I can tell you what my wife said about it.

530
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:11,850
What seems to be
the trouble there, Kirby?

531
01:13:12,062 --> 01:13:16,854
Shenandoah Valley,
a place called Bridesdale,

532
01:13:17,067 --> 01:13:19,106
and Philip H Sheridan.

533
01:13:20,112 --> 01:13:23,397
- How about a cup of coffee?
- Yeah, sure.

534
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:26,572
You'll find it's stronger.

535
01:13:42,509 --> 01:13:45,178
You look very elegant, sir.

536
01:13:49,557 --> 01:13:54,469
Gentlemen, with the regiment leaving
for a winter campaign in the morning,

537
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:58,436
and the women and children
being sent to Fort Bliss,

538
01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:03,395
I am sure you have many arduous
and difficult tasks to perform.

539
01:14:03,613 --> 01:14:07,112
Please do not let me
keep you from them.

540
01:14:09,285 --> 01:14:12,156
Thank you for the coffee, Madame.

541
01:14:12,372 --> 01:14:15,491
- You're welcome.
- You're very kind, Mrs York.

542
01:14:15,708 --> 01:14:17,202
Thank you.

543
01:14:29,013 --> 01:14:32,097
You do look very elegant, Kirby.

544
01:14:32,308 --> 01:14:35,642
What I said about
the women and children is true.

545
01:14:35,853 --> 01:14:38,938
You're leaving in the morning
for Fort Bliss.

546
01:14:39,148 --> 01:14:43,016
Jeff is going with you.
He'll be one of the escorts.

547
01:14:44,654 --> 01:14:50,240
- He'll hate it, Kirby. He'll think that...
- He's my son. Our son.

548
01:14:50,451 --> 01:14:52,657
He's too young to...

549
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:55,361
He'll still hate it, Kirby.

550
01:15:00,628 --> 01:15:03,297
But I'll love you for it.

551
01:15:18,812 --> 01:15:22,347
I cleaned and ironed your uniform.

552
01:15:22,566 --> 01:15:24,606
It's a good job.

553
01:15:27,655 --> 01:15:31,984
I'd like to get my hands
on this white jacket sometime.

554
01:15:32,201 --> 01:15:35,617
That'll cost you four bits,
as they say out here.

555
01:15:35,829 --> 01:15:37,869
Four bits, huh?

556
01:15:47,841 --> 01:15:49,881
$10? I...

557
01:16:01,229 --> 01:16:03,934
Kathleen, that was meant for us.

558
01:16:05,567 --> 01:16:08,319
There's your change, Kirby.

559
01:16:10,530 --> 01:16:14,742
I've been carrying that around
for a long time, hoping someday...

560
01:16:14,951 --> 01:16:17,621
I'll take the flowers now.

561
01:16:24,669 --> 01:16:26,626
Well, I...

562
01:16:28,006 --> 01:16:31,090
Aren't you going to kiss me goodbye?

563
01:16:36,222 --> 01:16:39,508
I never wanna kiss you goodbye,
Kathleen.

564
01:16:51,446 --> 01:16:53,688
Well, here we are, children.

565
01:16:53,907 --> 01:16:56,362
We're all going on the choo-choo.

566
01:16:56,576 --> 01:16:59,328
Come on. There you are.

567
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:05,125
Ready, Mr Markham? Carry on.

568
01:17:06,919 --> 01:17:08,959
Goodbye, Mrs York.

569
01:17:11,924 --> 01:17:13,834
Upsy-daisy.

570
01:17:16,721 --> 01:17:20,421
Uncle Timmy, you're gonna be
a good boy, aren't you?

571
01:17:20,641 --> 01:17:22,681
Darling, darling.

572
01:17:26,189 --> 01:17:28,644
By your leave, sir.

573
01:17:28,858 --> 01:17:30,897
By your leave, sir.

574
01:17:38,659 --> 01:17:41,743
- You be careful, Trunkett.
- Yes, sir.

575
01:17:43,164 --> 01:17:46,615
Prepare to mount!

576
01:17:46,834 --> 01:17:48,873
Mount!

577
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:53,750
- I got this from the paymaster.
- That's sweet.

578
01:17:53,966 --> 01:17:57,667
- I'll write you at Fort Bliss.
- Be sure not to forget.

579
01:17:59,430 --> 01:18:01,553
I won't forget.

580
01:18:01,765 --> 01:18:05,051
Wagons and escorts, lead out!

581
01:18:05,269 --> 01:18:07,226
Forward!

582
01:19:47,787 --> 01:19:51,488
- Hey, Travis.
- I thought you'd show up.

583
01:19:51,708 --> 01:19:55,456
Where's your canteen, Sandy?
This one's dry.

584
01:19:57,046 --> 01:20:00,545
We'll have to report you to the sergeant.

585
01:20:00,758 --> 01:20:05,716
Bein' as I'm already on all the reports,
that ain't worryin' me none.

586
01:20:13,062 --> 01:20:15,138
I'm hungry.

587
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,147
Bean?

588
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:27,822
Nobody ever told the army
they grow beef round here?

589
01:20:28,035 --> 01:20:31,653
Not lately.
We'll be on cold rations for three days.

590
01:20:32,748 --> 01:20:35,417
One of you better tell the lieutenant

591
01:20:35,626 --> 01:20:40,003
that the waterhole I come by
this morning is all muddied up.

592
01:20:41,090 --> 01:20:44,838
- Big Indian signs.
- We'd better get going.

593
01:20:48,347 --> 01:20:50,803
Thank your pappy for his horse.

594
01:20:51,016 --> 01:20:53,056
You thank him.

595
01:23:50,652 --> 01:23:54,021
Back to post.
Tell the colonel what's happened.

596
01:24:26,188 --> 01:24:28,227
Look out, Indian!

597
01:24:36,698 --> 01:24:40,114
Jeff! Jeff! Hand me your gun, boy!

598
01:24:42,203 --> 01:24:44,243
Go ahead, Jeff!

599
01:25:38,551 --> 01:25:40,590
Dr Wilkins.

600
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:59,610
- Report.
- Four troopers, sir.

601
01:26:02,241 --> 01:26:04,910
They got away with the children.

602
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:25,050
Trooper York brought the word.
We came as soon as we could.

603
01:26:37,776 --> 01:26:40,694
Those children, Kirby.

604
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:43,478
We'll get 'em back.

605
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:47,399
Well done, men.

606
01:26:49,496 --> 01:26:52,616
Forward, trot, yo-ho!

607
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:54,790
Follow me!

608
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:09,656
Doctor.

609
01:28:12,912 --> 01:28:14,952
Doctor, sir.

610
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:20,336
Corporal Bell.

611
01:28:27,009 --> 01:28:29,049
Sorry, son.

612
01:28:29,262 --> 01:28:32,346
- Permission to go forward?
- Stay here.

613
01:28:32,556 --> 01:28:36,886
- It's my wife! Wouldn't you wanna go?
- Yes, I would, but...

614
01:28:37,103 --> 01:28:40,187
If I had a friend, he'd keep me here.

615
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:45,355
Stay with me, boy.

616
01:28:45,569 --> 01:28:47,609
Pack mule!

617
01:29:09,426 --> 01:29:11,466
Troop, halt!

618
01:29:20,396 --> 01:29:24,607
- Who is that?
- The deserter, Tyree, sir. On your horse.

619
01:29:27,694 --> 01:29:29,770
Arrest him.

620
01:29:37,704 --> 01:29:40,658
You're under arrest, Tyree.

621
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,917
Here!

622
01:29:47,631 --> 01:29:49,670
Any liquor in this village?

623
01:29:49,883 --> 01:29:53,963
Mucha tequila. They were sluggin' it
down copious like when I left.

624
01:29:54,179 --> 01:29:56,884
- Drums, singing?
- Yes, sir.

625
01:29:57,099 --> 01:30:00,183
Vengeance dance.
They'll dance until dawn and then...

626
01:30:00,393 --> 01:30:03,644
- Where are the children held?
- In an old church, sir.

627
01:30:03,855 --> 01:30:08,564
- Is it dark enough for you to get in?
- With two men I pick, sir.

628
01:30:08,777 --> 01:30:10,935
Two men you pick?

629
01:30:12,030 --> 01:30:16,858
I know that you are an excellent judge
of horse flesh, Trooper Tyree.

630
01:30:17,077 --> 01:30:19,864
Proved that when you stole my horse.

631
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:24,208
But how are you as a judge
of men for a dangerous mission?

632
01:30:24,417 --> 01:30:27,502
I consider myself a good judge
of the men I trust, sir.

633
01:30:29,089 --> 01:30:32,173
That's a good answer.
Call your volunteers.

634
01:30:33,718 --> 01:30:35,758
Sandy! Jeff!

635
01:30:37,722 --> 01:30:40,295
Troopers Boone, York.

636
01:30:41,392 --> 01:30:43,350
Yo.

637
01:30:58,117 --> 01:31:01,202
Take my horse. Good swimmer.

638
01:31:01,412 --> 01:31:04,496
- Get it done, boy.
- Thank you, sir.

639
01:32:52,022 --> 01:32:55,473
Sandy, are you scared?

640
01:32:55,692 --> 01:32:59,310
Me? Yo.

641
01:33:18,381 --> 01:33:20,421
Troop, halt.

642
01:33:22,844 --> 01:33:26,544
Pass the word. Dismount.

643
01:33:30,351 --> 01:33:32,640
Forward by trooper.

644
01:34:38,669 --> 01:34:42,417
Oh, Sandy! I'm sorry.
I thought you were an Indian.

645
01:34:42,631 --> 01:34:45,383
Be quiet, Margaret Mary.

646
01:34:48,971 --> 01:34:50,714
Hi, Jeff.

647
01:34:50,931 --> 01:34:52,971
Thanks very much.

648
01:34:54,476 --> 01:34:59,981
- Honey, where are the children?
- They're over there asleep.

649
01:35:03,235 --> 01:35:07,363
You're gonna have to be brave.
There's gonna be lots of shootin'.

650
01:35:07,573 --> 01:35:09,731
Oh, goody!

651
01:35:30,762 --> 01:35:33,431
You youngsters, be quiet.

652
01:35:40,605 --> 01:35:45,018
I can't figure out which side that kid's on.
Them or ours.

653
01:35:56,037 --> 01:35:58,196
Let's go, Alamo!

654
01:35:59,290 --> 01:36:01,616
Margaret Mary!

655
01:36:36,577 --> 01:36:39,662
What the hell's the matter with you?

656
01:36:39,872 --> 01:36:41,912
Sorry, Sandy.

657
01:36:48,714 --> 01:36:51,751
Bugler. Tell 'em charge.

658
01:36:53,094 --> 01:36:56,842
- First platoon!
- Second platoon!

659
01:36:57,056 --> 01:36:59,298
Follow me!

660
01:36:59,517 --> 01:37:02,186
Shooters, follow me!

661
01:37:42,351 --> 01:37:45,601
The wagon's coming. Get 'em loaded.

662
01:38:32,567 --> 01:38:34,607
Margaret Mary!

663
01:39:01,054 --> 01:39:05,680
All right, men! Once again, follow me!

664
01:39:26,037 --> 01:39:28,706
Once more, men! Hit 'em again!

665
01:40:00,029 --> 01:40:02,068
Pull it out, Jeff.

666
01:40:08,370 --> 01:40:10,410
Go ahead.

667
01:40:13,334 --> 01:40:15,825
- Get it done, Reb.
- Yo.

668
01:40:37,316 --> 01:40:40,934
- Children secure?
- Children secure. Ready to move out.

669
01:40:43,655 --> 01:40:47,867
Son, help me to my horse.

670
01:40:57,502 --> 01:41:01,203
Bugler. Sound recall.

671
01:42:16,414 --> 01:42:18,453
Our boy did well.

672
01:43:02,334 --> 01:43:05,418
The honour detail is formed, sir.

673
01:43:06,505 --> 01:43:09,755
"For gallantry in action
beyond the call of duty, "

674
01:43:09,967 --> 01:43:16,764
"on 8th July, in an engagement against
hostile Apache Indians by the US Army"

675
01:43:16,974 --> 01:43:21,267
"by virtue of the power vested in me
by the President of the United States, "

676
01:43:21,478 --> 01:43:24,562
I hereby commend the following men:

677
01:43:24,773 --> 01:43:27,893
"Corporal Bell, Trooper Boone, "

678
01:43:29,069 --> 01:43:32,734
"Trooper York, Trooper Tyree, "

679
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:36,276
"Navajo Indian scout Son of Many Mules, "

680
01:43:36,493 --> 01:43:39,992
"given under my hand this 16th day of... "

681
01:43:40,205 --> 01:43:42,613
Hey, you! Soldier boy!

682
01:43:42,833 --> 01:43:46,700
And Trooper Tyree is given
a seven-day furlough! Yo!

683
01:43:54,094 --> 01:43:57,628
Travis has swiped
your horse now, General.

684
01:43:57,847 --> 01:44:01,548
Whatever else the man is,
he's a good judge of horse flesh.

685
01:44:01,768 --> 01:44:04,639
An excellent judge, sir. Excellent.

686
01:44:05,355 --> 01:44:07,561
Pass and review!

687
01:44:07,774 --> 01:44:11,059
First troop forward! Yo!

688
01:44:19,327 --> 01:44:21,284
Sheridan.

689
01:44:37,470 --> 01:44:39,510
Eyes right!
