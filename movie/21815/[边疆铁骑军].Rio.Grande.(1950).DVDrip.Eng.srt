00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,551
At Chapultepec...

166
00:12:00,582 --> 00:12:03,876
my father, your grandfather...

167
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:07,242
shot for cowardice the son
of a United States senator.

168
00:12:07,286 --> 00:12:08,620
That was his duty.

169
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:10,194
I will do mine.

170
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,657
You've chosen my way of life.

171
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:17,863
I hope you have the guts
to endure it.

172
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:22,394
But put out of your mind... any romantic
ideas that it's a way of glory.

173
00:12:22,766 --> 00:12:25,101
It's a life of suffering
and of hardship...

174
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:30,141
an uncompromising devotion
to your oath and your duty.

175
00:12:30,242 --> 00:12:32,123
JEFF: Have I the colonel's
permission to speak?

176
00:12:32,154 --> 00:12:33,780
KIRBY: Within proper limits,
yes.

177
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,416
I didn't ask
to come to this regiment, sir...

178
00:12:36,447 --> 00:12:39,408
but I wouldn't have it otherwise
now that I'm here.

179
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:41,816
May I also
put something straight?

180
00:12:41,847 --> 00:12:42,889
Proceed.

181
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,640
I'm not in this post
to call you father.

182
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:48,268
I was ordered here
as Trooper Jefferson Yorke...

183
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,269
of the United States Cavalry.

184
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,021
That's all I wish to be, sir.

185
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,391
KIRBY:
Then we understand each other.

186
00:12:54,422 --> 00:12:55,840
JEFF: We do, sir.

187
00:12:55,871 --> 00:12:58,164
KIRBY: Sergeant Major?

188
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:00,841
The recruits are for field duty
as of now.

189
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,656
Dismissed.

190
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,158
QUINCANNON: Trooper Yorke.

191
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,997
KIRBY:
What are you waiting for?

192
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,346
Trooper Yorke expects his salute
to be returned.

193
00:13:12,385 --> 00:13:13,969
Military regulations, sir.

194

Can't you go around faster?

197

Keep your heads down!
That's it!

198
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,501
Hey, hey!

00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,336
Keep it coming now!

There we go!

Once again and faster!

SERGEANT:
Put it up another notch.

204
00:14:04,184 --> 00:14:05,727
Give 'em a good jump.

205
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,716
See how easy it is?

206
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:12,786
When I was a young man
like yourselves...

207
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:14,610
I could jump nine feet tall...

208
00:14:14,906 --> 00:14:16,449
with an Indian under each arm.

209
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:18,900
What tribe?

210
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:24,948
QUINCANNON:
Once again and faster!

211
00:14:25,785 --> 00:14:27,328
Horsemen. Ha ha!

212
00:14:30,128 --> 00:14:31,254
TROOPER: Yaah!

213
00:14:33,857 --> 00:14:36,067
TYREE: Appears to me
they make a lot of fuss...

214
00:14:36,161 --> 00:14:38,413
jumping a horse
over some sticks.

215
00:14:39,207 --> 00:14:40,833
BOONE: Yo.

216
00:14:40,864 --> 00:14:42,907
JEFF:
That's a six-foot jump, Travis.

217
00:14:42,993 --> 00:14:44,327
QUINCANNON:
Give them their heads.

218
00:14:44,358 --> 00:14:46,818
Now over!

219
00:14:46,849 --> 00:14:48,016
There, you see?

220
00:14:48,047 --> 00:14:50,233
That gives you an idea
what horsemanship is like...

221
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,538
in the United States Cavalry.

222
00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:55,074
Now after that
comes the Roman teams.

223
00:14:55,105 --> 00:14:56,439
That's easy.

224
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,388
It's the way the Romans
used to ride.

225
00:14:58,419 --> 00:14:59,878
The ancient Romans.

226

Standing up.

227
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,027

like to try that before you eat?

QUINCANNON:
That's the general idea...

249
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,359
but before I'm through
with youse...

250
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,569
you'll be taking them jumps
backwards.

Is there another man...

252

PRESCOTT: The marshal
wants to make a routine check.

He thinks perhaps this man
might be among our new recruits.

ain't it, Mink?

328
00:22:10,986 --> 00:22:13,446

Keep your left in his face.

You're doing good.

Like that.

333
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:25,470

None of that, see?

none of that.

SERGEANT: Yes, sir?

bags are unloaded...

QUINCANNON:
Welcome home, darlin'.

387
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:35,145
KATHLEEN: I see you still
have that arsonist with you.

388
00:27:35,176 --> 00:27:37,261
KIRBY: You mean Quincannon?

389
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:41,285
He is a sergeant major
in the United States Army.

390
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:45,289
Anything he may have done
long ago in the line of duty...

391
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:47,375
he did in obedience
to my orders.

392
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,300
Reluctantly, I may add.

393
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:53,547
KATHLEEN:
Oh. The reluctant arsonist.

394
00:28:11,236 --> 00:28:14,489
KATHLEEN: The safest way for
us to start our conversation...

395
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,480
would be for you to just say...

396
00:28:16,513 --> 00:28:19,766
"To what do I owe the honor
of your visit?"

397
00:28:20,055 --> 00:28:22,682
KIRBY: I saw the reason
for your visit this morning.

398
00:28:22,774 --> 00:28:24,150
KATHLEEN: How is he?

399
00:28:24,195 --> 00:28:26,697
KIRBY: He's grown considerably,
I thought.

400
00:28:26,728 --> 00:28:28,855
Right now he's bruised up
a little.

401
00:28:28,886 --> 00:28:30,262
Had a fight. Not much.

402
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,190
KATHLEEN: A fight?

403
00:28:32,221 --> 00:28:33,722
With another soldier.

404
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,421
KIRBY: Hardly an officer.

405
00:28:35,725 --> 00:28:38,394
KATHLEEN:
Hardly with an officer?

406
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,760
He's not gentleman enough
for that.

407
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:43,752
KIRBY: You said it... soldier.
That's enough for me.

408
00:28:43,783 --> 00:28:45,117
Not for me.

409
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:50,091
Jeff was boyishly ashamed when
he was expelled from West Point.

410
00:28:50,122 --> 00:28:51,748
He shouldn't have enlisted.

411
00:28:51,785 --> 00:28:53,745
I could have sent him
to Lexington.

412
00:28:54,037 --> 00:28:55,663
He could have tutored
in mathematics...

413
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:57,612
and then got his commission.

414
00:28:57,696 --> 00:29:00,907
But he did enlist,
and he's here.

415
00:29:01,093 --> 00:29:04,221
KIRBY: And here he'll stay,
and here he'll serve.

416
00:29:04,252 --> 00:29:06,629
Ramrod, wreckage, and ruin.

417
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,662
Still the same Kirby.

418
00:29:08,693 --> 00:29:11,153
Special privilege

419
00:29:11,184 --> 00:29:13,060
Still the same Kathleen.

420
00:29:14,418 --> 00:29:17,963
Kirby, I've come
to take Jeff home.

421
00:29:18,193 --> 00:29:20,737
He signed enlistment papers.
He took an oath.

422
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,193
KATHLEEN: Oath.

423
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:24,613
Jeff can be released
from the army...

424
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:28,267
bought off honorably
for the sum of $100.

425
00:29:28,298 --> 00:29:31,926
I brought that amount with me
in Yankee gold.

426
00:29:31,957 --> 00:29:34,834
You forget
one very important detail.

427
00:29:34,865 --> 00:29:38,827
Such a release requires my
signature as commanding officer.

428
00:29:41,921 --> 00:29:45,132
You've overlooked several other
important details.

429
00:29:45,796 --> 00:29:48,465
Number one...
you're a fine figure of a woman.

430
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,169
Number two...
you probably haven't eaten.

431
00:29:57,311 --> 00:29:59,813
There's a box of flat silver
in that chest.

432
00:29:59,844 --> 00:30:01,679
I'll send someone over
to set the table.

433
00:30:02,794 --> 00:30:04,295
You will dine with me?

434
00:30:05,093 --> 00:30:06,511

00:50:44,255 --> 00:50:46,173
would like to give you
his trade.

642
00:51:01,763 --> 00:51:02,805
DOC: As a doctor...

643
00:51:02,836 --> 00:51:05,547
I would diagnose those
as saddle sores.

644
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:20,199
PRESCOTT: Trooper Tyree.

645

646

PRESCOTT: I have a demand
from the Deputy U.S. Marshal...

647
00:51:27,799 --> 00:51:29,884
to seize you under warrant...

648
00:51:29,915 --> 00:51:33,168
issued by due and legal process
by the district court...

649
00:51:33,997 --> 00:51:37,667
Fernando X. Hernandez,
judge...

650
00:51:37,698 --> 00:51:39,533
on charges of manslaughter.

651
00:51:41,568 --> 00:51:44,946
TYREE: The way that language sounds,
I must be arrested.

652
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:47,145
PRESCOTT: As Colonel Yorke
is not present...

653
00:51:47,176 --> 00:51:49,344
you will await his signature
before taking him.

654
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:51,947
MARSHAL: Any place I can lock
this soldier boy up...

655
00:51:51,978 --> 00:51:53,744
till the paperwork's signed?

656
00:51:53,775 --> 00:51:57,653
DOC: With a fella like this,
I mean a desperado...

657
00:51:58,396 --> 00:52:00,106
why not leave him
at the hospital?

658
00:52:00,137 --> 00:52:02,960
MARSHAL: That's a good idea.
Get my feet checked.

659
00:52:02,992 --> 00:52:04,660
They've been bothering me.

660
00:52:05,006 --> 00:52:06,799
You want to come along
peaceful-like...

661
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:09,249
or want me
to use these cuffs on you?

662
00:52:09,575 --> 00:52:11,076
TYREE: I'm always peaceful,
marshal.

663
00:52:11,107 --> 00:52:13,025
Ain't no use doing nothing else.

664
00:52:14,093 --> 00:52:15,636
TYREE: Excuse me, ma'am.

665
00:52:17,582 --> 00:52:20,001
KATHLEEN: You're arresting
that nice man for manslaughter?

666

PRESCOTT: Not me, Mrs. Yorke.

The United States
Deputy Marshal.

668
00:52:27,047 --> 00:52:28,798
KATHLEEN: Manslaughter.

669
00:52:29,884 --> 00:52:32,219
KATHLEEN: What are you going
to do about it?

670
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:35,253
A gentle soul who'd walk
10 miles out of his way...

671
00:52:35,284 --> 00:52:36,576
before he'd step on an ant.

KATHLEEN:
You go to the hospital.

674
00:52:41,017 --> 00:52:43,109
Get him some tobacco,
anything he wants.

675
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,183
And we'll get him a lawyer
to defend him.

676
00:52:45,214 --> 00:52:46,840
JEFF: He's partial
to molasses candy.

677
00:52:46,871 --> 00:52:48,122
KATHLEEN: Get some.

678
00:52:51,226 --> 00:52:53,519
KATHLEEN: Yankee justice.

Doctor...

702
00:54:32,849 --> 00:54:36,114
with your fine education,
would you tell me something?

703

DOC: Yeah.

704
00:54:37,268 --> 00:54:38,826
QUINCANNON:
What is an arsonist?

705
00:54:41,979 --> 00:54:44,914
An arsonist is a person
that sets buildings on fire

706
00:54:44,945 --> 00:54:47,709
for profit
or perverse excitement.

707

DOC: Why?

710
00:55:00,786 --> 00:55:04,313
It all started when we rode down
the Shenandoah Valley, doctor.

Every trooper
of General Sheridan's command...

QUINCANNON:
It was me cursed luck...

714
00:55:12,103 --> 00:55:15,630
to be ordered to burn the crops
and the barns at Bridesdale...

715

with herself
looking daggers at me...

Well, it was grim duty
for both you and the colonel.

That was his wife's plantation,
wasn't it?

723
00:55:44,882 --> 00:55:45,974
Aye.

724

She said it was
in her same family...

Sir Walter Raleigh...

that did the dirty deed!

I wish the same, Senor Colonel.

KATHLEEN:
I'm sorry your duty...

803
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,857
made you destroy
two beautiful things...

804

Bridesdale and us.

KIRBY: I'm sorry, too,
but it had to be done.

You know that.

Bridesdale.

KATHLEEN: That was easy.

809
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:25,792
It required
just physical effort.

810
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,211
KIRBY: The other
would require more?

ruin your army career.

959
01:11:47,623 --> 01:11:51,457
I'm going to issue an order
and give it to you personally.

960
01:11:52,504 --> 01:11:54,938
I want you
to cross the Rio Grande...

961
01:11:55,684 --> 01:11:58,016
hit the Apache,
and burn them out.

962
01:11:58,047 --> 01:11:59,947
I'm tired of hit-and-run.

963
01:11:59,978 --> 01:12:02,572
I'm sick of diplomatic
hide-and-seek.

964
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:09,368
Strip the camp of all women
and children.

965
01:12:09,399 --> 01:12:10,866
Send them to Fort Bliss.

966
01:12:11,533 --> 01:12:13,763
Be prepared to remain
all winter.

967
01:12:14,706 --> 01:12:17,266
All next winter, if necessary.

968
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:21,455
KIRBY: I've waited a long time
for that order, sir...

969
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:23,480
which, of course, I didn't hear.

970
01:12:23,511 --> 01:12:25,222
SHERIDAN:
Of course you didn't hear.

971
01:12:28,603 --> 01:12:29,968
SHERIDAN: If you fail...

972
01:12:30,086 --> 01:12:33,055
I assure you, the members
of your court-martial...

973
01:12:33,086 --> 01:12:36,317
will be the men who rode with us
down the Shenandoah.

974
01:12:36,348 --> 01:12:39,010
I'll hand-pick 'em myself.

975
01:12:39,632 --> 01:12:40,963
KIRBY: Shenandoah.

976
01:12:42,618 --> 01:12:46,918
I wonder what history will say
about Shenandoah.

977
01:12:48,082 --> 01:12:50,550
I can tell you
what my wife said about it.

978
01:12:51,684 --> 01:12:54,448
What seems to be
the trouble there, Kirby?

979
01:12:54,653 --> 01:12:56,814
Shenandoah Valley...

980
01:12:57,220 --> 01:12:59,711
a place called Bridesdale...

981
01:13:00,291 --> 01:13:02,350
and Philip H. Sheridan.

982
01:13:02,451 --> 01:13:04,419
How about a cup of coffee, sir?

983
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:06,077
SHERIDAN: Yeah. Yeah, sure.

984
01:13:08,173 --> 01:13:10,403
KIRBY: You'll find it stronger.

985
01:13:25,849 --> 01:13:27,749
ST. JACQUES:
You look very elegant, sir.

986
01:13:31,182 --> 01:13:32,513
Ahem.

987
01:13:32,544 --> 01:13:34,171
Gentlemen...

988
01:13:34,583 --> 01:13:35,982
with the regiment leaving...

989
01:13:36,013 --> 01:13:38,106
for a winter campaign
in the morning...

990
01:13:38,137 --> 01:13:41,573
and the women and children
being sent to Fort Bliss...

991
01:13:41,604 --> 01:13:46,564
I am sure you have many arduous
and difficult tasks to perform.

992
01:13:46,595 --> 01:13:49,621
Please do not let me
keep you from them.

993
01:13:51,963 --> 01:13:54,363
ST. JACQUES:
Thank you for the coffee, madame.

994
01:13:54,888 --> 01:13:56,253
KATHLEEN:
You're welcome.

995

You're very kind, Mrs. Yorke.

KATHLEEN:
Thank you.

KATHLEEN:
You do look very elegant, Kirby.

998
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:18,951
KIRBY: What I said about
the women and children is true.

999
01:14:18,982 --> 01:14:21,109
You're leaving in the morning
for Fort Bliss.

1000
01:14:21,984 --> 01:14:23,815
Jeff is going with you.

1001
01:14:23,984 --> 01:14:25,918
He'll be one of the escorts.

1002
01:14:27,287 --> 01:14:29,812
He'll hate it, Kirby.
He'll think that...

1003
01:14:29,843 --> 01:14:32,311
KIRBY:
He's my son, our son.

1004
01:14:33,333 --> 01:14:35,699
He's too young to...

1005
01:14:36,016 --> 01:14:38,280
He'll still hate it, Kirby.

1006
01:14:43,696 --> 01:14:45,960
But I love you for it.

1007
01:15:01,682 --> 01:15:04,583
I cleaned and ironed
your uniform.

1008
01:15:05,307 --> 01:15:07,400
Well, it's a good job.

1009
01:15:09,827 --> 01:15:13,627
I'd like to get my hands
on this white jacket sometime.

1010
01:15:14,754 --> 01:15:17,723
That'll cost you 4 bits,
as they say out here.

1011
01:15:17,805 --> 01:15:19,898
4 bits, huh?

1012
01:15:19,929 --> 01:15:21,191
Uh-huh.

1013
01:15:30,385 --> 01:15:32,940
10 dollars?
I...

1014
01:15:44,237 --> 01:15:46,467
Kathleen, that was meant for us.

1015
01:15:48,671 --> 01:15:50,662
There's your change, Kirby.

1016
01:15:52,910 --> 01:15:55,970
Been carrying that around
for a long time...

1017
01:15:56,001 --> 01:15:57,935
hoping someday
that poor little...

1018
01:15:57,966 --> 01:15:59,297
I'll take the flowers now.

1019
01:16:07,358 --> 01:16:08,791
KIRBY: Well, I...

1020
01:16:10,803 --> 01:16:13,237
Aren't you going to kiss me
goodbye?

1021
01:16:19,229 --> 01:16:22,255
I never want
to kiss you goodbye, Kathleen.
