1
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:30,963
这一周的新闻报道让人难过
It's been a harrowing week in the news,

2
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:33,799
所以现在是时候来点更加轻松幽默的了
so now it's something much lighter and more fun.

3
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:37,368
是时候让新西兰人民最爱的流行文化记者
It's time for New Zealand's favorite pop culture reporter,

4
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,535
大卫 法瑞尔出马了
David Farrier.

5
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:46,441
你到目前为止对新西兰什么印象
What do you make of New Zealanders so far?

6
00:00:46,543 --> 00:00:49,710
我吗 我觉得他们 他们很友好
Me? Uh, I think that they're... They've been nice.

7
00:00:49,812 --> 00:00:51,111
大家都挺酷的
Everyone has been cool so far.

8
00:00:53,582 --> 00:00:55,315
你在这最想实现什么
What's the main thing you're trying to achieve here?

9
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:57,784
因为很显然你都创造了一些
Because obviously you've created a bit of a--

10
00:00:57,886 --> 00:00:59,251
我想生存
survival.

11
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:02,753
他死了
He's dead.

12
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,425
-现在我们准备要转圈了 -是的
- Now we're gonna spin around. - Yeah.

13
00:01:11,828 --> 00:01:13,093
哇 天啊
Whoa! Holy!

14
00:01:17,566 --> 00:01:19,732
真累人 哇
It's so tiring. Whoa!

15
00:01:22,436 --> 00:01:24,602
你得过什么外号
And what's your nickname that you've got now?

16
00:01:24,937 --> 00:01:26,236
驴夫人
The donkey lady.

17
00:01:27,905 --> 00:01:29,404
小心 我们要
Look out! Oh, look, we're going

18
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,938
让一名记者挨踢了
- to have a reporter kicked.

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,172
踢得真狠啊
It's quite a kick.

20
00:01:41,616 --> 00:01:43,082
我说不出来曾经采访过
I can't say I've ever interviewed anyone

21
00:01:43,184 --> 00:01:45,250
看起来和你一样的人
that looks exactly like you before.

22
00:01:46,253 --> 00:01:47,585
真的吗
Really?

23
00:02:03,302 --> 00:02:05,769
我的职业生涯就是观察
I've made a career out of looking at the weird

24
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:07,770
这个世界奇葩的一面
- and bizarre side of life.

25
00:02:09,306 --> 00:02:11,973
所以当我网上发现了奇怪的视频
So when I discovered a strange video online,

26
00:02:12,108 --> 00:02:14,174
我就知道下个故事有着落了
I knew I'd found my next story.

27
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:19,044
很好 很好
It's good. It's good.

28
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:25,549
一家叫做简 奥布莱恩传媒的公司
An American company called Jane o'brien media

29
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:26,983
正在筹划每月一次的活动
was running a monthly event.

30
00:02:29,053 --> 00:02:32,054
全球各地的年轻运动员都可以申请参加
Young athletes from anywhere on the planet could apply.

31
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:34,489
如果入选他们就免费飞到洛杉矶
If selected they got free flights to la,

32
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:38,792
在高档酒店住四晚 还可以拿到1500美元现金酬劳
four nights in a really nice hotel and $1500 cash.

33
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:43,328
这就是搔痒忍耐力比赛
It was called competitive endurance tickling.

34
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,197
大家现在和搔忍赛在一起
You're with the cet,

35
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,465
我们是搔痒忍耐力比赛的队伍
a competitive endurance tickling group we got here.

36
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:50,867
首先 我想和你说
And, uh, first of all I'd like to give a shout to you,

37
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:53,235
简 奥布莱恩传媒举办了这一切
Jane o'brien media, for making this happen.

38
00:02:53,437 --> 00:02:55,804
-谢谢 简 -我们都很感谢
- Thanks, Jane. - We all appreciate it.

39
00:03:03,178 --> 00:03:04,377
滚蛋
Fuck off!

40
00:03:09,683 --> 00:03:14,552
伙计们 天哪
Guys! Oh, my god!

41
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:19,689
他们的脸书主页很受欢迎
Their Facebook page was popular,

42
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,757
有成千上万个赞
with thousands of likes.

43
00:03:22,092 --> 00:03:23,825
而且大家都穿着阿迪达斯
And with everyone in Adidas gear,

44
00:03:23,927 --> 00:03:26,727
看起来好像这是某种挠痒比赛联盟
it seemed to be some kind of tickling league.

45
00:03:33,668 --> 00:03:36,669
这是我见过最奇怪的运动
It was one of the strangest sports I'd seen.

46
00:03:36,871 --> 00:03:38,370
不要
No!

47
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,275
当然了 我告知简 奥布莱恩传媒
So, of course, I told Jane o'brien media

48
00:03:44,377 --> 00:03:45,743
我想做个采访
I'd like to do an interview.

49
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:50,679
没收到许可与否的回应 我收到了这个
Instead of getting a yes or no, I got this.

50
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:52,847
非常无礼直白地告诉您
"To be brutally frank,

51
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:55,082
与同性恋记者的合作
association with a homosexual journalist

52
00:03:55,184 --> 00:03:57,284
并非我们可容忍的行为
is not something we will embrace.

53
00:03:57,386 --> 00:04:00,120
我们非常不想有同性恋立场的参与者
We desperately do not want a homosexual participant base

54
00:04:00,222 --> 00:04:02,055
申请该项目
applying for this project.

55
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:05,124
我担心的是你的采访风格 粉丝群
My concern is that your journalistic style, fan base,

56
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:07,859
以及你在自己国家的声誉
and reputation in your own country.

57
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:11,429
简 奥布莱恩传媒 黛比 库恩 致意
Regards, Debbie kuhn, Jane o'brien media."

58
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:17,467
回复很奇怪
It was a strange response,

59
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:20,036
尤其是考虑到这项运动看着有点
especially considering the sport did seem slightly...

60
00:04:21,905 --> 00:04:23,237
基
Gay.

61
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,575
在接下来的几周 黛比和简一直发邮件来
And over the coming weeks, Debbie and Jane kept e-mailing.

62
00:04:29,677 --> 00:04:31,410
这项赛事本质上是一项
"The competitive reality tickling

63
00:04:31,512 --> 00:04:32,577
仅限于
is a passionately

64
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:36,080
异性恋运动员的忍耐力活动
and exclusively heterosexual athletic endurance activity.

65
00:04:36,182 --> 00:04:38,882
我们最近拜读了谷歌到的
We have recently read a googled article about the knowledge

66
00:04:38,984 --> 00:04:40,950
您和您同性伴侣生活起居的那篇
of your living with a homosexual partner

67
00:04:41,052 --> 00:04:42,651
名噪一时的文章
becoming quite a stir in New Zealand."

68
00:04:42,753 --> 00:04:45,386
这世上其他人并没有到处
"The remainder of the globe does not in all corners

69
00:04:45,488 --> 00:04:47,788
散布要接纳你的生活方式的观念
share some of the more liberal acceptance of your lifestyle."

70
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,423
与我而言 任何与同性恋有关的
"To me anything concerning homosexuality

71
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:52,324
都属于客观失调[该说法源自于天主教 认为同性恋取向是客观失调]
is at best an objective disorder."

72
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:55,560
以你为耻 小新西兰基 死基佬
"Shame on you!" "Little gay kiwis." "Faggot."

73
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:01,798
考虑到简传媒制作的东西
It was hard to take the insults seriously,

74
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,766
很难让人对以上辱骂当真
given what Jane was producing.

75
00:05:05,336 --> 00:05:08,637
甚至正相反 这使我比以往更加好奇
If anything, it made me more curious than ever.

76
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:13,073
您的呼叫已被转接至
Your call has been forwarded

77
00:05:13,175 --> 00:05:16,476
语音信箱 简 奥布莱恩传媒
to the voicemail for Jane o'brien media.

78
00:05:21,982 --> 00:05:22,848
既然没人接听电话
With no one picking up the phone,

79
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,250
我找来了我的极客朋友朋友迪兰
I got my geeky friend Dylan to do some digging

80
00:05:25,352 --> 00:05:27,352
来挖挖这家神秘的公司
into this mysterious company

81
00:05:27,454 --> 00:05:29,420
还有这位特别咄咄逼人的女士有什么料
and this overly aggressive woman.

82
00:05:29,522 --> 00:05:32,122
我得滚动一下 可以开始了
So, I'm going to just scroll up. So here we go.

83
00:05:32,224 --> 00:05:33,856
这就是简 奥布莱恩传媒的网址
So, it's janeobrienmedia.Com.

84
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,691
注册在Nederdietsen旗下
It's registered to nederdietsen.

85
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,126
他发现简 奥布莱恩传媒
He discovered that while Jane o'brien media

86
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:40,528
好像是在美国境外运营
seemed to be operated out of America,

87
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:44,198
归一家叫Nederdietsen的德国公司所有
it was owned by a company in Germany called nederdietsen,

88
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:49,102
该公司拥有和挠痒有关的300多个域名
which owned nearly 300 domain names all related to tickling.

89
00:05:53,575 --> 00:05:56,108
随着调查的进一步深入
This tickling wormhole was getting deeper,

90
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,177
所以迪兰和我在网上用博客记录了我们的发现
so Dylan and I blogged about what we'd found.

91
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,956
回响还不错
So, the pay's good.

92
00:06:16,058 --> 00:06:19,325
什么 好吧 等等
What? Okay, hold on.

93
00:06:19,427 --> 00:06:21,627
我们的故事引起了很多人的关注
Our story got a lot of attention,

94
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:23,795
被摘录到了新闻即时阅网
being picked up on websites like reddit

95
00:06:23,797 --> 00:06:25,696
和一个美国的播客上[类似广播的形式 但是方便回放]
and an American podcast.

96
00:06:25,798 --> 00:06:27,664
-后退 后退 -当我说
- Back up. Back up. - When I say

97
00:06:27,766 --> 00:06:29,999
挠痒比赛的时候 你觉得我在说什么事情
competitive tickling, what do you think I'm talking about?

98
00:06:30,101 --> 00:06:32,401
我是说 我觉得你在说
I mean, I think you're talking about, uh,

99
00:06:32,503 --> 00:06:34,469
某种有组织的运动
some sort of organized sport--

100
00:06:34,571 --> 00:06:36,237
-是的 -挠痒运动
- Yeah. - ...Of tickling.

101
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:38,305
主要就是这周这事在互联网上热度爆表
Basically what happened was this kind of blew up

102
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:41,975
因为一个新西兰的伙计
on the Internet this week, because a dude in New Zealand,

103
00:06:42,077 --> 00:06:47,146
一名记者 像是 在脸书主页上的事吧
a reporter, like, happened across this Facebook page.

104
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,014
但只是为了好玩么 他们只是
But is it just for fun? They just...

105
00:06:49,116 --> 00:06:50,348
很显然就是好玩吧
I mean, obviously it's just for fun?

106
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,582
就是为了好玩吗
Is it just for fun?

107
00:06:51,684 --> 00:06:52,749
是挠痒
- It's tickling.

108
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:54,817
抱歉 我没记得问过挠痒的问题
Sorry, I don't think that question's ever been asked

109
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:57,352
挠痒的问题就像火星问题似的
about tickling before. It's like a martian question

110
00:06:57,454 --> 00:06:59,587
就是好玩么
- about tickling. - "Is it for fun?"

111
00:07:00,323 --> 00:07:03,357
人们对我们的发现很感兴趣
People were so interested by what we discovered,

112
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:05,859
迪兰和我决定就这件非常之奇怪的
Dylan and I decided to make a documentary

113
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:08,528
事件做一个纪录片
about this utterly bizarre subject.

114
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,978
两周之后
Two weeks later,

115
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,347
我们收到了简 奥布莱恩传媒从纽约发来的律师函
we heard from Jane o'brien's New York attorney,

116
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,015
来自罗密欧 萨尔塔
Romeo salta.

117
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,885
他最近因为参与一件
He'd recently made headlines in a case

118
00:07:34,953 --> 00:07:36,552
同性恋色情明星
involving a gay porn star

119
00:07:36,654 --> 00:07:37,719
将受害者碎尸
who chopped a man up

120
00:07:37,721 --> 00:07:40,555
并邮寄尸块给政客的案件而声名大噪
and mailed his body parts to some politicians.

121
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:44,225
事情当然没有就此变得无聊
Things certainly weren't getting any less weird.

122
00:07:45,394 --> 00:07:49,462
他信中告诉我们停下所作所为
His letter told us to stop what we were doing, or else.

123
00:07:53,934 --> 00:07:57,001
很快我们收到了来自萨尔塔的邮件告知我们
Soon we were receiving e-mails from salta telling us

124
00:07:57,103 --> 00:08:00,337
已经对我们的行为提交了诉讼文件
that legal action had been filed in the us.

125
00:08:06,311 --> 00:08:08,978
我没有钱雇佣新西兰律师
I had no money to hire a New Zealand lawyer,

126
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,080
更不用说面对美国司法系统
let alone face the American justice system.

127
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:17,418
然后 最妙的是 简 奥布莱恩传媒告诉我们
Then, to top it all off, Jane o'brien media told us

128
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,721
他们派三人穿过大半个地球 正从纽约飞到
they were flying three people across the world from New York

129
00:08:20,823 --> 00:08:22,722
新西兰和我们见面
to New Zealand to see us.

130
00:08:23,357 --> 00:08:26,424
他们对阻止做这个纪录片这事很是认真
They're clearly serious about stopping this documentary.

131
00:08:39,336 --> 00:08:42,403
简没说他们要乘哪个航班到达
Jane wouldn't tell us what flight they were arriving on,

132
00:08:42,505 --> 00:08:44,271
但是她告诉了我们具体日期
but she did tell us the day.

133
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:47,940
所以早晨5点开始 我就在到达区等他们
So from 05:00 am, I waited at arrivals.

134
00:08:49,777 --> 00:08:51,443
不知道会发生什么
Not sure what to expect,

135
00:08:51,611 --> 00:08:53,711
我用一个彩虹颜色的标志
I figured I'd disarm the situation

136
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:55,679
缓和了气氛
with a rainbow-colored sign.

137
00:09:06,858 --> 00:09:08,090
事情进展的如何
How's it going?

138
00:09:10,127 --> 00:09:12,127
我感觉我做了一个很棒的欢迎标志
I thought I'd make up a good welcoming sign.

139
00:09:12,496 --> 00:09:13,928
你好吗 先生
Good. How are you, sir?

140
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:17,731
没关系 旅途如何
That's all right. I thought I'd arrive. How was the flight?

141
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:20,800
很好 新西兰航空吗
Oh, good. Air New Zealand?

142
00:09:21,335 --> 00:09:23,802
很好 嘿 大家伙
Oh, good. Hey, guys.

143
00:09:24,971 --> 00:09:28,405
我是凯文 见到你很高兴 大卫 见到你很高兴
Kevin, nice to meet you, sir. David. Nice to meet you.

144
00:09:32,477 --> 00:09:35,211
可以 把这个当礼物送你
You can. I gift this to you.

145
00:09:35,313 --> 00:09:37,279
用标志的标准来评定的话 相当不错了
As a sign, I thought it was pretty good.

146
00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:41,148
那么 咱们排个时间这周见见吧
Well, look, let's line up a time to meet this week.

147
00:09:44,552 --> 00:09:45,617
明天吗
Tomorrow?

148
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:46,784
-我们今天需要休息 你明天有空么

149
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,385
好 明天没问题
Okay, tomorrow works well.

150
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,720
- 很感谢来见我们

151
00:09:50,822 --> 00:09:53,422
没问题 这是新西兰的礼仪
Oh, that's okay. It's the New Zealand hospitality.

152
00:09:54,892 --> 00:09:56,424
你可以到那找我
You can get me there.

153
00:09:57,727 --> 00:10:00,593
嗯 咱们从始至终都在拍摄
Yeah, we're just rolling from the beginning. Yeah, yeah.

154
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:03,828
好 在新西兰是这样的
Okay. We've got a thing in New Zealand,

155
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,230
我们可以在公众场合进行拍摄
we're okay to film in public spaces.

156
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,065
所以我只是在一路拍下来
So I'm just following the journey.

157
00:10:14,338 --> 00:10:16,504
好 没问题 我们
Okay, all right. Well, we're--

158
00:10:19,006 --> 00:10:20,071
不是
It's not--

159
00:10:20,073 --> 00:10:22,306
我们在拍纪录片
Okay. Well, I mean, we're shooting a documentary,

160
00:10:22,408 --> 00:10:24,908
我们会继续 只是
so we'll keep... it's a--

161
00:10:25,677 --> 00:10:26,776
呃
Mm.

162
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:31,112
好
Okay.

163
00:10:31,114 --> 00:10:34,448
我们在新西兰公开场合可以拍摄的
Okay. We're okay to film in public spaces in New Zealand,

164
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,783
所以我们这里也拍了
so we're doing that here.

165
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:39,185
好吧 我们会很快见面的
All right, we'll see you soon.

166
00:10:39,287 --> 00:10:40,653
-好 听起来不错
- Okay, sounds good.

167
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:42,921
好吧 回见
All right, see you soon.

168
00:10:44,457 --> 00:10:45,989
别担心 很快就可以坐下来谈谈
No worries. We'll talk soon.

169
00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:04,271
喂 马尔科 我是大卫 法瑞尔 你怎么样啦
Hey, Marko. It's Dave farrier. How are you?

170
00:11:06,275 --> 00:11:08,608
很好 你怎么在奥克兰落脚的
Yeah, good. How are you settling into Auckland?

171
00:11:22,156 --> 00:11:24,022
没 听着不错 
Okay. No, that sounds good to me, I think.

172
00:11:24,124 --> 00:11:27,792
只是 迪兰和我都谈过了 我们都没信心
Just, Dylan and I both talked, and we just weren't confident,

173
00:11:27,894 --> 00:11:29,193
觉着径直走进一间屋子
or didn't think it was a good idea

174
00:11:29,428 --> 00:11:31,994
那样不好 也许只是文化上的问题吧
just to go straight to a room. Maybe it's a cultural thing.

175
00:11:33,764 --> 00:11:35,530
但是会议室 
But a conference room

176
00:11:35,632 --> 00:11:37,298
你选的 好吧
- um, of your choosing,

177
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,467
在不在希尔顿都没问题
Whether it's at the Hilton or elsewhere, is absolutely fine.

178
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,686
嗯
And, um...

179
00:13:12,247 --> 00:13:13,112
没问题
Sure.

180
00:13:57,619 --> 00:13:59,485
凯文没有很好没有很好的说服迪兰
Kevin didn't take to Dylan very well

181
00:13:59,587 --> 00:14:01,587
他想单独见我
and wants to meet me alone.

182
00:14:02,856 --> 00:14:05,623
我迅速做了这个隐蔽的电子设备
I quickly make this covert piece of technology.

183
00:14:06,058 --> 00:14:08,291
咖啡杯里的相机
A camera in a coffee cup.

184
00:14:12,363 --> 00:14:14,429
结局是什么呢 你最后得到了什么
What's the end game here? What do you get at the end

185
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:15,930
你得到了想要的一切吗
or even if you get everything you want?

186
00:14:16,032 --> 00:14:19,166
我们在这冒这险干嘛
Mm. Mm. - And what are we risking here?

187
00:14:20,102 --> 00:14:24,003
我们真的希望那个有钱的家伙
You know, do we really want someone coming after you

188
00:14:24,105 --> 00:14:25,604
对你穷追不舍吗
with all that money?

189
00:14:26,206 --> 00:14:27,705
我这辈子认识很多有钱人
I've known a lot of rich people in my life.

190
00:14:27,807 --> 00:14:28,872
我为其中很多人打过工
I've worked for a lot of them.

191
00:14:28,974 --> 00:14:31,341
他们不吃我们这一套
They don't work by the same set of rules.

192
00:14:31,443 --> 00:14:33,509
他们神龙见首不见尾
They don't dangle them out of buildings any more,

193
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:35,444
因为没有这个必要
but they don't have to.

194
00:14:35,546 --> 00:14:38,346
就是问题所在 他们控告你
And that's the thing. They start suing,

195
00:14:38,748 --> 00:14:41,682
你却只得半途而废
and you're done halfway through or a quarter of the way through

196
00:14:41,817 --> 00:14:44,050
因为辩护的花费使你债台高筑
because it costs so much to defend yourself.

197
00:14:44,118 --> 00:14:45,851
所以 本质上来说 
So unless... Essentially, I mean,

198
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:48,820
如果我们不拍了 我们就完蛋了
unless we stop the doco, we're gonna be fucked.

199
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,555
真的 归根结底就是这样
Really. It seems that's what it comes down to.

200
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,823
我不会直接把话挑明
I'm not gonna use those words directly,

201
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,225
因为这样太不明智了
because that wouldn't be prudent.

202
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:58,328
但是 重申一下 除非你收手
But... let me rephrase. Unless you stopped...

203
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,164
除非我们能够找到改善现状的办法
Unless we can figure out a way to ameliorate that situation,

204
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:03,099
我们退一步
we all are.

205
00:15:09,373 --> 00:15:12,607
面临诉讼和以及财力雄厚的公司
Facing lawsuits and a company with deep pockets,

206
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:15,142
我在想我们是否应该放手[据导演所说 诉讼求偿额高达四千万刀]
I wondered if we should just walk away.

207
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,146
但是迪兰也深陷其中
But Dylan was part of this now

208
00:15:20,248 --> 00:15:23,148
他不愿意向恶势力低头
and didn't want to give in to a bunch of bullies.

209
00:15:24,251 --> 00:15:26,651
迪兰想要单刀赴会吗
Dylan wants to pursue this on his own?

210
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:30,454
额 我从他说的话里面推断出来的
Uh, I gather from what he's saying, yeah.

211
00:15:30,756 --> 00:15:33,523
好 嗯 如果迪兰想这么做的话
Okay. Um, if Dylan wants to do that,

212
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,958
迪兰 他会这么做的
Dylan does... Dylan will do that.

213
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,494
如果你想明哲保身的话 离开得远远的
If you don't want to do that, then just walk away from it.

214
00:15:40,096 --> 00:15:41,495
是的
Yeah.

215
00:15:41,797 --> 00:15:45,130
我会 那只会针对迪兰了
And I will... Dylan will be dealt with accordingly.

216
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:48,099
学校怎样
How was school?

217
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:49,710
重点是 大卫 你懂得
The main thing, David, you know,

218
00:15:49,711 --> 00:15:51,268
我想告诉你的是
that I wanted to tell you is that

219
00:15:51,403 --> 00:15:52,802
你觉得你很聪明
I think that you're brilliant.

220
00:15:52,904 --> 00:15:54,803
事业风顺
And that you have a great career.

221
00:15:54,905 --> 00:15:57,338
因此我 很高兴知道
So I was really, really happy to find out

222
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,541
你愿意全身而退
that you wanted just to distance yourself from it.

223
00:16:00,643 --> 00:16:05,312
但是不懂迪兰为什么就不愿意呢
And I don't understand why Dylan would not want to.

224
00:16:07,082 --> 00:16:08,548
正如凯文说的 也是我最担心的
What I'm worried about too, I know Kevin says,

225
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,116
好 如果他执意这么做的话
"Well, if he wants to go ahead with it,

226
00:16:11,552 --> 00:16:12,284
就让他去吧
let him go ahead with it."

227
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:13,017
但是他会成头号靶子 相信我
But he'll become a real target, and believe me,

228
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,686
让他出尽洋相
it will be really ugly for him.

229
00:16:14,788 --> 00:16:16,354
我会 我也不想看到事情变成那样
And I would... I would hate to see that too,

230
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:17,721
因为我知道他有家庭
because I know he has a family

231
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:22,225
你知道他可能是个不错的小伙子
and, you know, he's probably, uh, a good bloke down deep.

232
00:16:33,469 --> 00:16:35,902
在我生命中从未因为挠痒
I've never heard threats like this in my life,

233
00:16:36,237 --> 00:16:38,737
有过这样的威胁
and all of this over some tickling!

234
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:42,506
凯文和马尔科飞回美国
Kevin and Marko fly back to America.

235
00:16:43,408 --> 00:16:46,642
几天后 迪兰和我也去了美国
And a few days later, Dylan and I follow.

236
00:16:47,678 --> 00:16:50,245
被超乎想象的金钱打压欺侮
Something about bullies with way too much money

237
00:16:50,347 --> 00:16:52,313
让我不能就这么放弃
has convinced me I shouldn't drop it.

238
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:54,110
加上 我们知道
Plus, we think there's a

239
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:56,582
这个星期有挠痒赛
competitive tickling shoot happening this week.

240
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:01,986
我们联系视频里的将近一百位男孩
We've reached out to nearly a hundred boys in the videos,

241
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,587
但是他们都不愿意出面
but they all seem too nervous to talk.

242
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:12,993
最后有个名叫TJ的同意见面
Finally tj agrees to meet us.

243
00:17:16,598 --> 00:17:19,498
我跟凯文 克拉克在洛杉矶市中心某地方碰面
We met Kevin Clarke downtown la somewhere.

244
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,667
我不记得它具体在哪 但是个工作室
I can't remember exactly where it was at, but it was a studio.

245
00:17:24,337 --> 00:17:26,003
看起来很正常
He seemed pretty normal at the time.

246
00:17:27,306 --> 00:17:29,572
第一次见他 他有点
My first impression of him, you know, he was just, like,

247
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:31,840
有点奇怪
kind of... Kind of a little weird.

248
00:17:34,277 --> 00:17:35,576
你知道那时我还小
You know, I was young at the time,

249
00:17:35,678 --> 00:17:36,777
没想太多
didn't think nothing of it,

250
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:38,912
我满脑子就是 赞 2000美元唉
and I was like, "Cool." You know, $2000 or whatever,

251
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:40,346
耶 太赞了
"Yeah. It's gonna be cool."

252
00:17:44,718 --> 00:17:46,250
那段时间家里经济困难
It was actually a hard time for my family.

253
00:17:46,252 --> 00:17:48,494
家人有得癌症的
A family member of mine was going through cancer,

254
00:17:48,495 --> 00:17:50,187
日子紧巴巴的
and money was tight at the household.

255
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:51,574
我有点绝望
So I was a little bit desperate

256
00:17:51,575 --> 00:17:53,690
有了这点钱 一边工作
at the time as well for money, working on the side,

257
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:55,691
还能做点喜欢的 因此当我看到美元符号
and doing what I can. So when I heard this dollar sign,

258
00:17:55,793 --> 00:17:57,726
灵光一闪 好 我该这么做
I was like, "Yeah," You know, "I'll definitely do that."

259
00:17:59,796 --> 00:18:01,362
然后我走进去
And then I went inside

260
00:18:01,464 --> 00:18:03,764
注意到房间里面站满了人
and noticed that it was all guys in there.

261
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,401
但是当我这样做 哦 该死
And that's when I was like, "Oh, dang!" Like...

262
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:13,605
我不知怎么就被绑住了
And I didn't know I was gonna get tied down.

263
00:18:14,207 --> 00:18:16,540
我不知道会这是为什么
I had no idea what it'd be for.

264
00:18:16,642 --> 00:18:18,642
老实说 我就想 好了 发生什么事情
Honestly, I was like, "Okay, what?"

265
00:18:20,245 --> 00:18:21,656
在那时我在想 很好
At that point I was like, "All right,

266
00:18:21,657 --> 00:18:23,145
你知道吗 木已成舟
you know what? It's already going down.

267
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:24,613
我不知道会发生什么
I don't really know what it's for,

268
00:18:24,715 --> 00:18:26,080
希望别太出格
but hopefully it never gets out."

269
00:18:46,732 --> 00:18:48,264
不不不 没那么过分
No, no, no. Not any fuckin'...

270
00:18:48,366 --> 00:18:52,100
卧槽 真的是挠痒
Ah! Fuck! That actually tickles, dude.

271
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:58,939
卧槽
Ah! Fuck!

272
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,108
这么多处刑方式
Being violated on so many different levels right now.

273
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:05,177
还有其他运动员 做格斗的
There was other athletes. There was mma guys.

274
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:06,611
有个健美运动者
There was a bodybuilder,

275
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:09,780
还有一些演员 平常的演员
and then there was a couple of actors, normal actors.

276
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,348
有些我还在广告里见过
I've seen some of them on commercials,

277
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,616
电视广告 一般的家伙
TV commercials. Normal guys.

278
00:19:13,718 --> 00:19:16,150
看起来跟一般人没区别
Like, completely normal people.

279
00:19:18,053 --> 00:19:20,420
放开我的脚
Get the fuck off my feet!

280
00:19:20,522 --> 00:19:21,988
简直是酷刑
It was a torture project.

281
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,490
这就是凯文 克拉克告诉我的
That's what I believe Kevin Clarke told me.

282
00:19:24,592 --> 00:19:26,150
这跟军事手段
There was something to do with

283
00:19:26,151 --> 00:19:28,593
或者同类事物有关
even a military tactic, or something like that.

284
00:19:28,695 --> 00:19:30,361
他要
He was gonna do...

285
00:19:30,563 --> 00:19:32,930
我认为简在做研究
I think he said Jane was doing a project

286
00:19:33,032 --> 00:19:35,966
关于将挠痒用于军事手段的研究
on using tickling as a military tactic.

287
00:19:36,068 --> 00:19:37,167
那时 我
And at that point, I...

288
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:39,168
简直是瞎扯 有懂吗
I knew it was complete bullshit, you know?

289
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,270
我想 好 军事上将会用挠痒
I was like, "Okay, the military is gonna use tickling

290
00:19:41,372 --> 00:19:43,505
做酷刑吗
as a torture tactic?"

291
00:19:43,607 --> 00:19:45,873
卧槽
Fuck!

292
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:52,144
什么时候看到视频了
When did the video come back to get you?

293
00:19:53,447 --> 00:19:56,381
大概持续一年时间 也许更长一点
About a year, maybe a little more, ago.

294
00:20:07,392 --> 00:20:08,491
看一些旧文章
to read old articles

295
00:20:08,493 --> 00:20:10,659
想看看哪个队在文章标题或者训练里
or see what teams might have listed me in an article

296
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:11,826
提到我
or try-outs.

297
00:20:16,665 --> 00:20:20,133
吓到我的是 油管上有个视频
And to my surprise, a video was on YouTube.

298
00:20:20,235 --> 00:20:24,303
你好 我是TJ 我在挠痒比赛
Hello. I'm tj, and I'm here on a tickling competition.

299
00:20:24,405 --> 00:20:26,872
额 第一个问题是 你是挠痒痒爱好者吗
And, uh, first question is: "Are you ticklish?"

300
00:20:26,974 --> 00:20:29,074
嗯 如果我不是 我就不会来了 所以
Well, obviously I'm ticklish if I'm here, so,

301
00:20:29,176 --> 00:20:30,575
这问题真可笑 但是 额
that's kind of a silly question. But, uh...

302
00:20:30,677 --> 00:20:33,077
我真的坐在了镜头前
It was just me sitting in front of the camera

303
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:35,879
谈论怎么挠痒痒
talking about the, uh, tickling process.

304
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:38,348
奇怪 我在想 还不坏
Just weird things. And so I was like, "Okay, it's not that bad."

305
00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:41,350
当你被问 你喜欢挠痒痒吗
"When you are asked, 'are you ticklish?'

306
00:20:41,452 --> 00:20:43,752
你会怎么回答 为什么
how do you normally respond and why?"

307
00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:47,689
通常 我说 不 我不喜欢挠痒痒
Normally, I say, "No, I'm not ticklish."

308
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:52,993
所以我给简发了邮件 请求撤下视频
So I emailed Jane and asked her to take the video down.

309
00:20:56,832 --> 00:20:59,165
她没有回复
She didn't ever reply.

310
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:01,600
因此我决定自己解决
So I took the matters into my own hands,

311
00:21:01,768 --> 00:21:03,667
我找油管说
and I, uh, told YouTube that

312
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:05,869
他们非法使用我的名字
uh, they're illegally using my name.

313
00:21:09,341 --> 00:21:13,109
因此油管撤下视频 噩梦开始了
So YouTube took the video down. That's when it all started.

314
00:21:17,447 --> 00:21:19,113
现在我就想笑
"Now, I am laughing."

315
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:22,716
我不觉得你搞定这件事了
"I don't think you've grasped the magnitude

316
00:21:22,818 --> 00:21:24,384
事情反而闹大了
of what you have provoked."

317
00:21:24,886 --> 00:21:27,453
我想知道你怎么收拾摊子
"I'm interested to see how you handle the fallout.

318
00:21:27,555 --> 00:21:32,123
迄今为止一团糟 此致 黛比 库恩
So far, badly." "Regards, Debbie j. Kuhn."

319
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:35,092
这个叫黛博拉的人闯入我的生活
That's when this Deborah person popped into my life.

320
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:38,329
意味着失去了一切控制
I mean, just all hell broke loose.

321
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:45,669
你能找到的视频网站 都有这个视频
Every kind of video search you can find, it was up there.

322
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,305
他出现在我的邮箱
And then it pops up in my emails,

323
00:21:49,407 --> 00:21:51,340
更是在油管
and then it pops up more on YouTube,

324
00:21:51,842 --> 00:21:53,308
哪里都有它
and it just starts appearing everywhere.

325
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,742
这个视频 所有的视频
This video... Just, all of them.

326
00:21:54,844 --> 00:21:56,243
一个接一个出现
All of them start blowing up.

327
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:07,185
还有恐吓 它说 小心
And there was threats. It said, "Watch out!

328
00:22:07,287 --> 00:22:08,419
不要让你家人看见
Your family better watch out

329
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:10,487
会给你祖宗抹黑
because we're gonna put your last name to shame.

330
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:13,056
你什么时候搜索你的姓 视频自动弹出
Any time you search your last name, it's gonna pop up."

331
00:22:13,158 --> 00:22:14,891
赤裸裸的威胁
Like, direct threats.

332
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:19,261
他们还建了网站
They ended up making a website,

333
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:20,761
放了我个人信息
putting my personal information:

334
00:22:20,863 --> 00:22:22,662
名字 住址
My name, my address,

335
00:22:22,797 --> 00:22:25,530
私人电话 邮箱
my personal phone number, my email address,

336
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:28,499
愚蠢的谎言
all with just dumb lies.

337
00:22:31,537 --> 00:22:34,571
然后黛比 库恩出场
Then Debbie kuhn starts going off on me left and right,

338
00:22:34,673 --> 00:22:37,073
给我当教练的高中发邮件
sending emails to the high school that I coach at.

339
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:40,609
我作为前任雇主向您发送这份消息
"I have additional information as a past employer.

340
00:22:40,711 --> 00:22:42,544
我不想要这家伙在您的队伍里
You don't want this guy in your league.

341
00:22:42,646 --> 00:22:45,380
你受得了媒体报导这个
Can you afford the distraction, the press,

342
00:22:45,482 --> 00:22:48,850
出柜男性同性恋挠痒爱好者的骚扰吗
with an outed gay guy having a male tickling fetish,

343
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:50,952
他喜欢挠痒 被挠痒
in which he likes to tickle and be tickled

344
00:22:51,054 --> 00:22:54,121
还被其他同性恋运动员和健美运动员绑起来
by tied-up other gay athletes and bodybuilders?"

345
00:22:54,223 --> 00:22:56,022
完全是污蔑 说我是瘾君子
False accusations, saying I'm a drug addict

346
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,691
说我的是娈童者 说我是同性恋等等
and I was a child molester and I'm gay, and this and that,

347
00:22:58,793 --> 00:23:00,893
完全没有这回事
which none of those things have ever been true.

348
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,076
我原本多自信
I've always been very proud.

349
00:23:19,178 --> 00:23:20,911
走到哪 都在为自己骄傲
The way I walk around, I'm proud of who I am.

350
00:23:21,013 --> 00:23:22,312
你知道我在说什么吗 就是说
You know what I mean? So to speak.

351
00:23:22,414 --> 00:23:23,813
我很为自己运动员的身份感到骄傲
I'm confident in myself as an athlete,

352
00:23:23,915 --> 00:23:25,281
我是一个人 一个运动员
as a person, as a player.

353
00:23:26,584 --> 00:23:27,883
但是当我训练时
But when I'd go to try-outs,

354
00:23:27,985 --> 00:23:29,918
只想到
the first thing I would think about is,

355
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,320
完了 要是教练看过视频怎么办
"Well, I wonder if these coaches have looked up that video?"

356
00:23:34,424 --> 00:23:35,923
该来的还是来了
And it's happened. It has happened.

357
00:23:36,025 --> 00:23:37,724
我被踢出橄榄球队了
I've been released from football teams.

358
00:23:37,826 --> 00:23:39,158
他们告诉我原因了
They've told me, uh,

359
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,960
曾经我是队里那个位置最优秀的运动员
that I'm the best player on that team at that position,

360
00:23:42,095 --> 00:23:44,895
但是因为视频的影响
but because it is a distraction for the media,

361
00:23:44,997 --> 00:23:45,996
他们不需要这样的关注
they don't need that attention

362
00:23:45,998 --> 00:23:46,993
他们会找别人
and they'll go with somebody

363
00:23:46,994 --> 00:23:48,665
因为他们不想去解释
else 'cause they don't feel like explaining it.

364
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:50,427
要知道 因为这件事
You know, and I've actually

365
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:53,102
我沾上了不少麻烦
dealt with a lot of things because of it.

366
00:23:54,605 --> 00:23:57,606
钱没了 工作黄了 骚扰不断
It's cost me money, it's cost me jobs, it's caused me harassment,

367
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:00,842
正如黛比 库恩和简 奥布莱恩所愿
which is exactly what Debbie kuhn and Jane o'brien wanted.

368
00:24:00,944 --> 00:24:03,744
所以 我说 无论怎样 他们赢了
So, I mean, more or less in that aspect, they've won.

369
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,454
因简 奥布莱恩传媒而受到困扰的
It's obvious we're not the only ones being harassed

370
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:18,255
不止我们
by Jane o'brien media.

371
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:21,858
有许许多多像TJ网的网站
And there are so many websites made up like tj's

372
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,659
依旧存在
which seem to exist purely

373
00:24:23,761 --> 00:24:25,794
羞辱那些挠痒者
to shame the guys who've been tickled.

374
00:24:29,032 --> 00:24:32,465
这些视频怎么了 为什么她这么咄咄逼人
What goes on at these shoots, and why is she so aggressive?

375
00:24:34,702 --> 00:24:36,268
迪兰在做一些调查
Dylan's been doing some research,

376
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:39,137
他似乎知道下一次拍摄的地点
and he thinks he knows where the next shoot is happening.

377
00:24:41,274 --> 00:24:43,641
我们监视工作室 想要发现
We stake out the studio, hoping to find out

378
00:24:43,743 --> 00:24:46,810
挠痒痒比赛怎么进行
how a competitive tickling shoot goes down.

379
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:49,011
好 车来了
Okay, car.

380
00:24:55,818 --> 00:24:57,651
又有一辆车 两辆
And another car. Two cars.

381
00:24:57,986 --> 00:24:59,452
两辆了
Two cars.

382
00:25:05,326 --> 00:25:06,692
你看得清车里情况吗
Can you see what the car's doing?

383
00:25:06,794 --> 00:25:07,993
看不清他
I've lost him.

384
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:14,699
那是谁 -哦 马尔科
Who's that guy? - Oh, that's Marko.

385
00:25:17,437 --> 00:25:20,738
是的 有四个人入镜了
Oh, yeah. And we've got four guys going in so far.

386
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,206
四个家伙
Four guys.

387
00:25:26,812 --> 00:25:28,344
那家伙是新西兰人
That's the guy from New Zealand.

388
00:25:28,446 --> 00:25:30,045
耶 那是凯文
Yep, there's Kevin.

389
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,667
窗户内笑声不断
We could hear laughter coming out of the vents.

390
00:25:58,771 --> 00:26:00,937
几个小时后
It went on for hours,

391
00:26:02,674 --> 00:26:05,241
男孩子们抽空在休息
the boys occasionally taking breaks.

392
00:26:17,621 --> 00:26:19,621
实在是太诡异了
You know, this is actually fucking creepy as fuck.

393
00:26:19,723 --> 00:26:21,689
就像是在开动员大会
Like, this feels to me like a pep talk.

394
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,889
是的
Yeah.

395
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:25,958
几天过去
As the day wraps up,

396
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,293
我想给凯文最后一个机会
I want to give Kevin one last chance

397
00:26:28,395 --> 00:26:30,361
告诉我们里面发生了什么
to talk about what's going on.

398
00:26:31,964 --> 00:26:33,296
还有诉讼在身
With pending lawsuits,

399
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:36,799
我小心翼翼不想沾惹是非
I'm cautious and don't want to storm into the studio.

400
00:26:39,003 --> 00:26:40,135
他们没锁门
They haven't locked the door.

401
00:26:40,237 --> 00:26:41,802
咱们过去吧
I think we go.

402
00:26:44,573 --> 00:26:46,105
好吧 咱们走
All right. Okay, let's go.

403
00:26:46,841 --> 00:26:48,907
一切还好吗 -还好
We're good? - Yep, we're good.

404
00:26:59,386 --> 00:27:00,551
这边走
Come this way.

405
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:04,754
这边走吧 我们会被认出来
Here we go. We've been spotted.

406
00:27:14,565 --> 00:27:18,300
哈喽 马尔科 嘿 大家好
Hello, Marko. Hey, guys.

407
00:27:27,344 --> 00:27:28,609
亚当 进行得怎么样
Adam, how's it going?

408
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,646
先生 你好啊
Hello, sir.

409
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:37,148
这里不欢迎我们吗
We're not welcome here?

410
00:27:40,686 --> 00:27:42,352
好吧 那 我们马上走
All right. Well, we'll head off.

411
00:27:43,355 --> 00:27:44,854
你不想最后再聊聊或是什么吗
You don't want to do any final chats or anything?

412
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:46,155
最后一次机会
Last opportunity.

413
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:52,627
我们只能做到这样了
That's all we can do.

414
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:02,302
在贝尔维尤大道上右转
Turn right on bellevue Avenue,

415
00:28:02,404 --> 00:28:04,170
第一个路口 右转
then take the first right.

416
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,508
我想 呃 在新西兰那事之后
I think... yeah, uh, after New Zealand and that,

417
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:12,777
我觉得这么说是很稳妥的 那就是我们没有
I think it's safe to say that we don't...

418
00:28:12,879 --> 00:28:15,312
我们没做凯文或是马尔科的采访
We don't have an interview with Kevin or Marko.

419
00:28:15,981 --> 00:28:17,280
我们当然也没让
And we certainly weren't getting

420
00:28:17,382 --> 00:28:20,282
更多的参赛者上镜
any more of the competitors to talk on camera.

421
00:28:20,384 --> 00:28:22,217
他们都吓坏了
They were all too terrified,

422
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:26,220
希望如果自己闭嘴 骚扰就会消失
hoping if they stayed quiet, the harassment would go away.

423
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,823
我是说 我们甚至只是在这儿
I mean, are we making the whole thing worse for everyone

424
00:28:30,925 --> 00:28:32,524
就把大家的事情弄得更糟了吗
just by even being here?

425
00:28:32,626 --> 00:28:34,359
嗯 我觉得有可能
Yeah. I think it's possible.

426
00:28:34,461 --> 00:28:37,528
我担心这会让那些人的状况变得更糟
I worry that we make it worse for some people who...

427
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,496
那些已经度过最艰难时期的人 你明白吗
Who've gotten through the worst of it, you know?

428
00:28:39,598 --> 00:28:40,663
嗯
Mm.

429
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,980
简 奥布莱恩显然对录像的目的
Jane o'brien clearly isn't being honest

430
00:29:00,082 --> 00:29:01,648
有所隐瞒
about what the videos are for.

431
00:29:02,017 --> 00:29:04,417
而且我确信 尽管穿着阿迪达斯
And I'm convinced that despite the Adidas gear,

432
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:06,986
这并不是一项实际的运动
it's not a real sport.

433
00:29:11,692 --> 00:29:13,491
我找到了一名在佛罗里达
I've tracked down a man in Florida

434
00:29:13,593 --> 00:29:15,693
也做被挠视频的男子
who also makes tickling videos,

435
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:19,396
不过 不像简 他很乐意谈论这些
but, unlike Jane, is more than happy to talk about it.

436
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:52,193
人们问我 痒痒的吸引力在哪儿
People ask me about what is the appeal of tickling?

437
00:29:53,663 --> 00:29:56,363
这有点像鞭子和铁链 你明白的
It's kind of like the whips and chains, you know,

438
00:29:56,465 --> 00:29:59,065
捆绑式性交之类的 有人被鞭打
bondage sort of thing, where somebody's getting flogged.

439
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:02,601
不过这也没到那个层次 你明白吗
But it's just really brought down a level, you know?

440
00:30:02,703 --> 00:30:04,402
这有点像虐待
It's like kind of a sadistic

441
00:30:04,504 --> 00:30:06,871
把你的意志施加到别人身上
exerting your will on someone else,

442
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:09,073
并让他们做出自己无法控制的事
and having them do something out of their control

443
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:11,808
比如大笑 却不能逃离
like laughing without being able to get away,

444
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:15,144
就像是 呃 挠痒折磨他们
as if it's, uh, tickle torture to them.

445
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:18,080
很多人似乎并不知道
And a lot of people don't seem to know

446
00:30:18,182 --> 00:30:19,915
对痒痒的迷恋
about the tickling fetish.

447
00:30:20,017 --> 00:30:21,716
你觉得这是不是有点 不为人知
Do you think it's a little bit more unknown?

448
00:30:21,818 --> 00:30:23,851
喔 当然 肯定的
Oh, totally. Yeah, completely.

449
00:30:23,953 --> 00:30:26,520
嗯 大多数人知道恋足癖
'Cause most people, you know, know about a foot fetish,

450
00:30:27,356 --> 00:30:28,988
不过挠痒痒
um, but tickling?

451
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,356
大部分人就像 "喔 那也叫事"
Most people are like, "Oh, wow. Is that a thing?"

452
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:39,563
在1999年 我刚研究生毕业
It was in 1999. I had just gotten out of grad school,

453
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:43,032
所以我只弄到一个摄像机
you know, so I just got a video camera,

454
00:30:43,134 --> 00:30:44,733
想了一个小小的商业计划
put together a little business plan,

455
00:30:45,869 --> 00:30:46,934
和我一个朋友谈了谈
talked to one of my friends

456
00:30:46,936 --> 00:30:49,069
他资助了我 我开了这家网站
and he financed me, when I started the site,

457
00:30:49,171 --> 00:30:51,570
我想大概用了6000或是7000美元
I think for $6000 or $7000.

458
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,540
之后立刻得到了反响
It got pretty much an immediate response.

459
00:31:08,987 --> 00:31:10,186
一年后 我挣到了足够我辞职
I was making enough after a year

460
00:31:10,288 --> 00:31:12,221
专职做这个的钱
to quit my job and do it full-time.

461
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:17,191
所以 就这样
So this is it?

462
00:31:17,493 --> 00:31:19,025
-就这样 -这个就是工作室
- This is it. - This is the studio.

463
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,093
-嗯 -椅子
- Mm-hm. - The chair.

464
00:31:22,329 --> 00:31:25,129
还有更衣室 浴室
And then the changing room, bathroom.

465
00:31:25,331 --> 00:31:27,964
那么 这所有的地方纯粹是为了挠痒痒
And so, this whole place is purely for the tickling?

466
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:29,231
没错
Yes.

467
00:31:33,203 --> 00:31:35,203
有几个不同的场景 对吧
Oh, so you've got a few different spaces, right?

468
00:31:35,305 --> 00:31:36,404
是啊
Yeah, yeah.

469
00:31:36,506 --> 00:31:38,138
我以前不在我家里做所有这些
I used to do all this out of my house.

470
00:31:38,306 --> 00:31:39,204
嗯
Yeah.

471
00:31:39,206 --> 00:31:41,773
就是 你知道的 一群人进来
And then it was, you know, a parade of people coming in,

472
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:44,642
拍片后 我还得打扫干净
do all this, have to clean up.

473
00:31:44,744 --> 00:31:47,611
在拍摄前必须清理干净
You know, have to clean it up before a shoot.

474
00:31:47,713 --> 00:31:50,280
而这样一来 我可以一走了之
And this way I can walk away.

475
00:31:50,382 --> 00:31:51,447
嗯 挺好的
Yeah, this is great.

476
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:52,614
就像 "我累了 回家去"
Like, "I'm tired. Going home."

477
00:31:52,716 --> 00:31:53,781
你搞完了
You're done.

478
00:31:53,783 --> 00:31:55,716
这是工作 对吧 就像工作 在家
Well, this is work, right? It's like work, home.

479
00:31:55,818 --> 00:31:57,250
嗯哼 就是
Mm-hm. Exactly.

480
00:31:57,819 --> 00:32:00,419
你以前为其他人做过类似的工作吗
Have you done stuff like this before for anyone else?

481
00:32:00,521 --> 00:32:02,220
还是这是一件特别的事
Or this sort of a unique thing for you?

482
00:32:02,322 --> 00:32:03,721
额 特别的
Uh, unique thing.

483
00:32:03,823 --> 00:32:06,290
我从没为挠痒痒的网站工作过
I never worked for a tickling site before.

484
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:07,424
-好吧 -没有 
- Okay. - No.

485
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,426
你听说要这么做之后 你怎么想的
And what did you first think when you got the pitch?

486
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:11,327
我是说 我大笑了会儿
I mean, I laughed about it.

487
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,228
就想 这不可能是认真的
I'm like, this can't be really serious,

488
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,962
人们不可能
like, people really can't...

489
00:32:15,064 --> 00:32:17,798
享受看这个或者承受这个
Enjoy watching this or getting it done.

490
00:32:18,433 --> 00:32:19,598
不过 呃我说 "为什么不呢"
But, um, I said, "Why not?"

491
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,166
我更像是个冒险者
You know, I'm more of like the risk-taker.

492
00:32:21,268 --> 00:32:24,002
我更愿意说我做了什么而不是没做什么
I'd rather say I did something than didn't do something.

493
00:32:24,104 --> 00:32:25,169
所以我躺下
So I came down,

494
00:32:27,339 --> 00:32:28,455
真是有点紧张 不知道该期待什么
really was kind of nervous, didn't know what to expect.

495
00:32:28,456 --> 00:32:29,572
然后 理查德让我放松
And then... But Richard put me at ease,

496
00:32:29,674 --> 00:32:31,607
一旦你被困住 你就束手无策了
and once you're trapped in you're there.

497
00:32:31,709 --> 00:32:34,476
所以呢 我是说 你可能也很享受
So, I mean, you might as well enjoy it.

498
00:32:34,678 --> 00:32:35,910
好吧
All right.

499
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,114
好的 准备好了吗 -我想
Okay, ready? - I think you're...

500
00:32:42,584 --> 00:32:43,649
今天对我下手轻点
Take it easy on me today.

501
00:32:43,784 --> 00:32:44,983
好啊 好啊 当然
Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

502
00:32:45,085 --> 00:32:46,150
好极了
That's good.

503
00:32:51,389 --> 00:32:53,255
-得珍惜我现在的自由 -是啊
- Got to enjoy my freedom now. - Yeah.

504
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,756
-因为我没办法 -挥手告别吧
- Because I cannot. - Wave goodbye.

505
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,490
我挣脱不了
I am not getting out.

506
00:32:58,693 --> 00:33:00,124
哦 该死
Oh, shit.

507
00:33:02,561 --> 00:33:05,495
挠痒痒的世界
The world of tickling.

508
00:33:10,366 --> 00:33:11,932
所以 喘口气
So, catch your breath.

509
00:33:14,269 --> 00:33:16,435
-喘了口气 -很好
- Breath caught. - Okay.

510
00:33:25,978 --> 00:33:28,111
好吧
All right.

511
00:33:28,213 --> 00:33:29,879
现在告诉大家 你是怎样的一个硬汉子
Now tell everybody what a tough guy you are.

512
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:38,820
继续
Just go.

513
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,866
住手
Stop.

514
00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:03,674
我的天
Oh, my gosh.

515
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:06,008
讨厌死了
I hate this.

516
00:34:50,152 --> 00:34:51,751
那么 你是什么时候
So when did you realize

517
00:34:51,853 --> 00:34:56,922
意识到挠痒是件色情的事
that you found tickling to be an erotic thing?

518
00:34:57,791 --> 00:34:59,257
当时我还很小
I was very young,

519
00:34:59,392 --> 00:35:04,094
大概也就五岁或六岁 非常 非常小
you know, probably five or six. You know, very, very young.

520
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:13,534
你在卡通或者杂志里看到一些东西 你明白
You see something in a cartoon or a magazine that, you know,

521
00:35:13,636 --> 00:35:15,702
作为一个小孩 你对那些东西很有兴趣
kind of interests you as a little kid,

522
00:35:15,804 --> 00:35:17,570
而对我来说 就像
and for me it would be, you know, like,

523
00:35:17,672 --> 00:35:20,572
卡通人物被挠痒或者被捆绑 或是
cartoon characters being tickled or tied up or,

524
00:35:20,674 --> 00:35:21,973
你懂的 那种事
you know, that sort of thing.

525
00:35:22,075 --> 00:35:24,742
而那些 让我觉得很刺激
And it would, you know, fascinate me,

526
00:35:24,844 --> 00:35:27,144
不过我当时不知道为什么
but I had no idea why.

527
00:35:50,268 --> 00:35:52,935
感觉怎么样
How do you feel?

528
00:35:53,437 --> 00:35:54,969
我觉得好累
I feel tired.

529
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:57,337
-我觉得身上好多汗 -我要帮你拿些水吗
- I feel sweaty. - Can I get you some water?

530
00:35:57,439 --> 00:36:02,641
好啊 喝点水应该好很多
Yeah, water would probably work.

531
00:36:03,877 --> 00:36:06,244
我渐渐对这些 呃
I started to become comfortable with this, uh,

532
00:36:06,379 --> 00:36:08,011
这种迷恋和这部分的我 感到很自在
fetish and this part of myself,

533
00:36:08,346 --> 00:36:11,246
而之后 我开始真正意识到那是我的一部分
and started to really realize that it was a part of myself,

534
00:36:11,348 --> 00:36:12,413
那时 我
when I...

535
00:36:12,515 --> 00:36:14,815
我上了美国在线网
When I got on aol

536
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,283
搜索了我一直在寻找的内容
and then did a search for what I was looking for

537
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:18,283
然后发现 "喔
and found that, "Wow!

538
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:20,668
事实上
There's actually, you know, quite a lot of

539
00:36:20,669 --> 00:36:21,284
有相当多其他人也热衷这个"
other people that are into this."

540
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,160
那是还是90年代末
At the time, the late '90s,

541
00:36:31,562 --> 00:36:34,863
嗯 有人在留言板上发了很多帖
was, um, somebody that posted on the message boards a lot.

542
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:39,800
她说她的名字是特里 特里 挠痒
And she said her name was Terri, Terri tickle.

543
00:36:40,135 --> 00:36:45,103
还有特里 迪西斯托 她放了真名
And Terri disisto, she put in what her real name was.

544
00:36:46,806 --> 00:36:48,705
她总会放一张她自己的照片
She always had a picture of herself.

545
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,242
就那种金发碧眼的漂亮大学女孩
You know, a blonde, pretty, college-aged girl.

546
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:56,445
而且 她总是用同样的措辞
And, she always posted the same verbiage.

547
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,113
那什么 "这不是色情
Something like, "This is not porn.

548
00:36:58,215 --> 00:37:00,048
我的兴趣在挠痒痒上"
My interest is in tickling."

549
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:05,286
她说她是个挠痒痒的狂热爱好者 而且
And she just said that she was a tickling fanatic and...

550
00:37:05,855 --> 00:37:08,222
我是说 那些帖子到处都是
But, I mean, these posts were everywhere.

551
00:37:11,326 --> 00:37:13,592
然后 就跳出了一些视频
And then, um, some videos started popping up,

552
00:37:13,694 --> 00:37:15,794
你知道 就是 完全无意中的
you know, very, you know, innocent.

553
00:37:17,363 --> 00:37:19,763
那些应该就是我最早在网络上看到的
And, those are probably the first

554
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:24,566
挠痒痒的视频了
tickle videos that I ever saw on the Internet.

555
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:31,271
90年代中期后
There are still traces of Terri tickle online

556
00:37:32,707 --> 00:37:34,407
在网上仍然有特里 挠痒的踪迹
from the mid-'90s,

557
00:37:34,408 --> 00:37:36,108
就像理查德说的 她沉溺于挠痒痒
and as Richard said, she was tickle-obsessed.

558
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,743
就像简一样 她也会雇人
Like Jane, she also hired other people

559
00:37:38,845 --> 00:37:40,611
拍她想要的视频
to shoot the videos she wanted.

560
00:37:43,282 --> 00:37:48,751
嗯 不过就是奇怪的富家女孩
Well, the, uh, just strange, rich brat,

561
00:37:49,453 --> 00:37:50,952
我猜你会这么说
I guess you could say.

562
00:37:51,788 --> 00:37:55,522
看男人们被绑起来 被挠痒
Someone who, uh, got her rocks off by, uh,

563
00:37:55,624 --> 00:37:58,358
来释放压力的什么家伙
seeing guys, uh, tied and tickled.

564
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,259
很显然是一个极端的女性施虐狂
Obviously an extreme dominatrix.

565
00:38:03,363 --> 00:38:04,662
在他一生中的大部分时光
For most of his life,

566
00:38:04,764 --> 00:38:06,630
戴夫 斯塔尔几乎都在
Dave starr has worked on the edges

567
00:38:06,732 --> 00:38:08,665
娱乐业的边沿工作
of the entertainment industry,

568
00:38:08,967 --> 00:38:11,667
甚至参演几部色情电影
even acting in a couple of pornos.

569
00:38:12,069 --> 00:38:13,334
在90年代中期
During the mid-'90s,

570
00:38:13,569 --> 00:38:16,703
他注意到特里在网上发帖 求挠痒痒的视频
he noticed Terri's online posts wanting tickling videos...

571
00:38:17,439 --> 00:38:18,704
要很多
Lots of them.

572
00:38:21,642 --> 00:38:26,510
特里当时在寻找18到23岁的年轻男子
Terri was, uh, out there looking for guys, uh, 18 to 23.

573
00:38:27,546 --> 00:38:31,847
而我 觉得这个
And I, uh, figured that it would, um...

574
00:38:33,116 --> 00:38:35,382
鉴于我有选角的工作经验
Be something right up my alley,

575
00:38:35,484 --> 00:38:36,716
这正中我下怀
based on my, uh, working in casting.

576
00:38:40,888 --> 00:38:44,389
她到底招募别人去做什么呢
What sort of things was she recruiting for specifically?

577
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:49,693
啊 痒痒折磨电影 痒痒折磨视频
Uh, tickle torture films. Tickle torture videos.

578
00:38:50,562 --> 00:38:52,528
你能把那个东西转过来让我看得到吗
Can you turn that thing around so I can see it?

579
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:54,062
好的
All right.

580
00:38:56,433 --> 00:38:58,032
-这样行吗 -嗯 可以
- Is that all right? - Yeah, that's good.

581
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:04,904
她声称是为了私人收藏
She claimed it was for a private collection,

582
00:39:06,908 --> 00:39:09,675
我就在想 "好吧 业余制作"
so I was thinking, "Okay, amateur hour."

583
00:39:16,183 --> 00:39:21,419
不过就我而言 我很快把它扩展到专业的水平上
But me, I rapidly took it into a professional level.

584
00:39:22,188 --> 00:39:24,588
好吧 你是挠痒痒爱好者吗
Okay, are you, uh, ticklish?

585
00:39:24,957 --> 00:39:26,256
嗯 是啊
Uh, yes, I am.

586
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:28,758
很好 向前走一步
Okay, step forward about a foot.

587
00:39:29,093 --> 00:39:32,694
很好 把你的双手放在脑后 双手十指交叉
Okay. Place your hands behind your head, inter-clasp them.

588
00:39:32,796 --> 00:39:34,729
不过 再向后退一点
Step back a little further, though.

589
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:36,163
很好 在那儿就好
Okay, right about there.

590
00:39:36,265 --> 00:39:37,530
很好 十指交叉
Okay, inter-clasp them

591
00:39:37,632 --> 00:39:39,765
在这整个挠痒测试的过程中
and do not release them at any time

592
00:39:39,867 --> 00:39:41,266
任何时候都不要放开
during the entire tickle test.

593
00:39:41,368 --> 00:39:42,834
给这家伙上最厉害的
Do your worst on this one.

594
00:39:43,303 --> 00:39:44,568
我们会让他们经过
We would put them in through

595
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,670
第一阶段的海选
their stage one audition,

596
00:39:46,772 --> 00:39:50,239
也就是提问和测试挠痒
which is the questions and the test tickles.

597
00:39:51,275 --> 00:39:54,109
不要歪倒 一直看向我们
Do not collapse. Stay looking up at us.

598
00:39:59,948 --> 00:40:01,414
一直面对着我们
Stay facing us.

599
00:40:08,521 --> 00:40:15,425
第二阶段是把他们绑到桌上 挠他们痒痒
Stage two is tying them to the table, tickling them,

600
00:40:15,527 --> 00:40:17,527
每十五分钟翻一次身
flipping them over every 15 minutes,

601
00:40:17,629 --> 00:40:21,030
就跟烤肠烤肉翻个儿似的
kind of like a sausage or meat.

602
00:40:24,801 --> 00:40:26,267
在那之后 呃
And then after that, uh,

603
00:40:26,369 --> 00:40:30,103
在那时我们开始了挠痒竞赛
we had the competitive tickling at that point.

604
00:40:30,205 --> 00:40:33,372
挠痒大战之类的事情
Tickle wars and stuff like that.

605
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:37,642
那就是批量制作了
And that would involve a massive production.

606
00:40:51,923 --> 00:40:53,422
好的 别笑了
Okay, don't laugh.

607
00:40:53,891 --> 00:40:55,957
你已经忍不住咯咯笑了 是不是
You're giggling already, aren't you?

608
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,060
那么 你可能就是 大卫 斯塔尔
Well, you just might be the type of person

609
00:41:00,162 --> 00:41:02,128
正在找的那类人
that David starr is looking for.

610
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,495
他是好莱坞的制片人
He is a Hollywood producer

611
00:41:03,597 --> 00:41:06,097
正在制作一款基于现实的真人游戏节目
working on a new reality-based game show

612
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:08,499
名叫 挠一挠聊一聊
called tickle talk.

613
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,409
它可能比
It might be preferable to

614
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,644
《幸存者》[CBS王牌真人秀 目前已经播出三十多季] 里生吃老鼠吃蛆要好受一点
eating rats or grubs on survivor

615
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,479
可也好不了多少
but just barely.

616
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:27,848
我是安妮 詹姆斯 K96新闻电台
I'm Anne James, ksen k96 news.

617
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:30,817
戴夫[大卫的昵称] 斯塔尔五年都持续有活
Dave starr had steady work for five years,

618
00:41:30,919 --> 00:41:34,152
哪怕在特里住院的六个月期间
even when Terri was hospitalized for six months.

619
00:41:34,754 --> 00:41:36,019
那段时间里
During that time,

620
00:41:36,121 --> 00:41:37,753
她给我写信详细说明
she just wrote letters specifying

621
00:41:37,855 --> 00:41:40,755
她想要在挠痒录像里的内容
exactly what she wanted in the tickling videos.

622
00:41:40,857 --> 00:41:43,023
大卫 圣诞快乐
"David, merry Christmas!

623
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,358
太抱歉了 我因为单核白血球增多症（一种传染性病症 部分症状和流感相似）正在住院
So sorry, I'm in the hospital with mono."

624
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,327
大卫 我只需要你做这几件事
"David, just a few things I need you to do..."

625
00:41:48,429 --> 00:41:50,996
告诉他们 我病一好马上把电脑送过去
"Tell them I will send the computer as soon as I'm well."

626
00:41:51,098 --> 00:41:53,364
他叫乔希 我希望在二月就又能够上网了
"His name is Josh." "I hope to be online again in feb."

627
00:41:53,466 --> 00:41:56,633
我还在病床上 没有其他事了 特里
"I'm still sick in bed." "That's all for now. Td."

628
00:41:59,971 --> 00:42:02,371
我最怕痒的地方 我猜是
My most ticklish place is, I guess...

629
00:42:03,374 --> 00:42:07,776
一定是 我的腿
Definitely, like... It'd have to be in my legs...

630
00:42:08,578 --> 00:42:11,879
比我的胳肢窝 和脚心还怕痒 我想
More than, like, my armpits or my feet, I think, but...

631
00:42:12,147 --> 00:42:14,714
那时候她想建一个网站
At that time she wanted to put up

632
00:42:14,816 --> 00:42:18,150
并且真的建了网站有一段时间
and did indeed put up a website for a while, uh,

633
00:42:18,252 --> 00:42:22,019
未经允许就发布那些视频
unauthorized releasing of the videos...

634
00:42:23,222 --> 00:42:25,155
不顾参与者的意愿
Against the agreement of the talent,

635
00:42:25,757 --> 00:42:27,156
然后我也翻脸了
and I flipped my lid.

636
00:42:27,591 --> 00:42:29,324
想当然啦
And, lo and behold,

637
00:42:29,426 --> 00:42:33,160
她开始用他们的名字注册这些域名
she goes and registers domains in their names

638
00:42:33,795 --> 00:42:35,461
然后开始
and then proceeds to...

639
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:40,331
把这些视频发布在这些网站上
Release all their content on to those particular websites.

640
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:53,709
她就给我发邮件 大概说
She was, like, sending me emails about, um,

641
00:42:53,811 --> 00:42:55,043
你觉得你妈妈
"What do you think your mother's

642
00:42:55,145 --> 00:42:56,844
对此会怎么看
gonna think about this?"

643
00:42:57,313 --> 00:43:01,181
然后 我就回说 去你妈的贱人
And then, like, I'd be like, you know, "Fuck you, bitch."

644
00:43:01,283 --> 00:43:05,851
然后她就开始跟我对着干
And she'd be, like... Like, totally antagonizing.

645
00:43:05,953 --> 00:43:10,689
我想说 她就是个贱屄
Like... I mean, she was such a cunt.

646
00:43:15,361 --> 00:43:19,229
她不只侮辱我还侮辱我的家人 你知道吗
It was an assault not just on me but on my family, you know?

647
00:43:20,298 --> 00:43:23,065
你瞧 我的家庭是再保守不过了
I mean, I couldn't have a more conservative family, you know?

648
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:26,969
我家人都是共和党人 从军的
I'm, I'm in a family full of republican, military people,

649
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:30,505
而我又是 我曾是个专业的银行家
and I'm a... I was a professional banker.

650
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:35,042
而现在 我在一个跟色情网站差不多的网页上面
And here I am, like, with basically a porn site,

651
00:43:35,144 --> 00:43:38,278
尽管我不是赤身裸体 但是 也没什么区别
where I'm not naked, but, I mean, I might as well be.

652
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:41,381
你看 这简直毁了我的人生
You know, this was ruining my life at the time.

653
00:43:41,483 --> 00:43:42,648
我当时是这样感觉的
That's how I felt.

654
00:43:42,883 --> 00:43:46,050
这无疑影响了我的生活
It certainly was affecting my ability to function,

655
00:43:46,152 --> 00:43:51,721
因为这太折磨人了
because it was so emotionally draining.

656
00:43:51,889 --> 00:43:57,124
还有部分原因是因为没有人帮我
Part of the reason was because there's nobody to help me.

657
00:43:58,494 --> 00:44:02,629
就好像你对你的人生无能为力
It's like you lose control over, you know, your life.

658
00:44:10,004 --> 00:44:13,738
嗯 就是那时 事情开始变得糟糕
Well, that's when the, uh, crap started happening,

659
00:44:13,906 --> 00:44:15,171
对我来说
uh, with me.

660
00:44:16,274 --> 00:44:19,475
额 我觉得 那好 因为是我
Um, you decide, "Okay, because I, uh,

661
00:44:19,577 --> 00:44:22,578
为她招来这些受害者
I closed down submissions for her,

662
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,745
那我
and,

663
00:44:23,747 --> 00:44:28,316
我想 我基本上就是她的痒贩子
I guess, I basically was like her tickling drug dealer,

664
00:44:28,685 --> 00:44:32,086
既然 她再也得不到她的痒了
and, uh, since she wasn't getting her drug any more,

665
00:44:32,188 --> 00:44:34,821
她开始痒病发作了
she was going through tickle withdrawals.

666
00:44:36,658 --> 00:44:38,524
发生了什么
And what happened?

667
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,828
我开始收到
I started, uh, receiving the, uh,

668
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,931
奇怪的明信片 奇怪的信息
strange postcards, and the, uh, strange messages.

669
00:44:47,767 --> 00:44:51,901
挠痒参与者开始收到信息
The, uh... the, uh, talent was starting to receive messages.

670
00:44:52,436 --> 00:44:57,071
她还用一种电话骚扰的东西
And, uh, she also deployed a thing called the phone blaster,

671
00:44:57,173 --> 00:45:03,677
就是给每个人打电话 一些恶心的内容
which was to call everybody with obscene messages.

672
00:45:38,312 --> 00:45:40,444
这个人真是嗑嗨了
This person's on drugs.

673
00:45:42,381 --> 00:45:46,316
这个人肯定是溜冰还是什么
This person's gotta be on crystal or something,

674
00:45:46,985 --> 00:45:50,252
往菊花里塞可卡因 类似的行为
or taking cocaine up the ass, or something like that.

675
00:45:51,054 --> 00:45:52,453
太奇怪了
It was weird.

676
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:57,890
我很乐意给你看这些
I'm glad to be able to make this available to you.

677
00:45:57,992 --> 00:46:00,625
大卫保留了一些特里发给他的信
David kept a number of letters Terri had sent him

678
00:46:00,727 --> 00:46:03,761
并很愿意给我看看它们的扰人程度
and was keen to show me the extent of the abuse.

679
00:46:04,563 --> 00:46:09,131
-好了 -就是这些神奇的东西
- All right. - This is the magic stuff.

680
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,666
好的 这里都有什么
All right, what have we got?

681
00:46:15,871 --> 00:46:18,605
嗯 基本上是一些
Yeah. Uh, these are basically copies

682
00:46:18,707 --> 00:46:21,474
她网上言论的打印件
of what she would post online.

683
00:46:21,943 --> 00:46:23,676
芭芭拉是谁 是你的
So who's Barbara? Is that your...?

684
00:46:23,778 --> 00:46:25,077
是我母亲
That's my mother.

685
00:46:25,779 --> 00:46:27,645
多毛又饥渴 多毛又饥渴
"Hairy and horny. Hairy and horny.

686
00:46:27,747 --> 00:46:29,847
怕痒的犹太摄像师 大卫 斯塔尔
Jewish tickle filmer David w. Starr

687
00:46:29,949 --> 00:46:31,415
鹰钩鼻 多毛又饥渴 
is hook-nosed, hairy and horny."

688
00:46:31,517 --> 00:46:36,953
就这几句话 她翻来覆去地讲
She's used that tagline for many, many, many times.

689
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,187
那你
What did your...?

690
00:46:38,556 --> 00:46:40,289
当这些信件出现
What did your mother think of this stuff

691
00:46:40,391 --> 00:46:42,357
你母亲是怎么看的
when this turned up? I mean...

692
00:46:42,459 --> 00:46:44,425
事实上 她的原话是
Actually, her phrase was, uh...

693
00:46:44,527 --> 00:46:47,528
这里有个她留给我的便签
Here's a, uh, note that she left me because, uh,

694
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:49,596
她会在信箱给我留着这些
she would hold these for me in the mail

695
00:46:49,698 --> 00:46:52,832
仅仅是说 又来个一件脏东西
and basically just say, "Here's another nasty thing."

696
00:46:52,934 --> 00:46:55,334
这有一封根本没打开过
And that one actually is unopened.

697
00:46:55,436 --> 00:46:58,103
到现在我都没打开过
I've never even opened it to this date.

698
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:04,374
让我们看看这个想象力丰富的小朋友都说了什么
And let's see what our little illustrious friend had to say.

699
00:47:04,876 --> 00:47:07,009
哦 天 还是张卡片
Oh, god. So it's a card.

700
00:47:08,779 --> 00:47:11,880
玫瑰是红的 紫罗兰是兰的
"Roses are red, violets are bue."

701
00:47:11,982 --> 00:47:13,648
蓝字都不会写
Can't spell worth shit.

702
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:16,484
大卫 w 斯塔尔是罪恶之源
"David w. Starr has brought this upon you.

703
00:47:16,586 --> 00:47:19,553
可能你希望 不是爱德华
Perhaps you wish, perhaps instead,

704
00:47:19,655 --> 00:47:22,122
而是大卫你的废物儿子 在九泉
that David your failure, not Edward, were dead."

705
00:47:22,224 --> 00:47:24,857
这是说我的哥哥 他已经死了
That's a reference to my brother, who is dead.

706
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:29,561
这也太极端了 有点神经质
That's, uh, really extreme. A little bit psycho.

707
00:47:30,063 --> 00:47:32,229
那么 我想 当你收到这些内容
But, I mean, what...? When you were getting all this material

708
00:47:32,331 --> 00:47:35,031
有些还在玷污你
and some of it's talking about your brother who

709
00:47:35,133 --> 00:47:36,532
已经去世的兄弟 -嗯嗯
- has passed away and... - Uh-huh.

710
00:47:36,634 --> 00:47:37,866
给你妈妈写信
Writing this stuff to your mother,

711
00:47:37,968 --> 00:47:40,668
我想说 这一定
I mean, that, that must have...

712
00:47:42,138 --> 00:47:45,405
我是说 每周都收到这些可不太好过
I mean, that... that's not nice receiving that on weekly basis.

713
00:47:45,507 --> 00:47:49,641
的确不好过 而且是每周都有
Uh, no, but it was on a weekly basis, uh, yeah.

714
00:47:51,745 --> 00:47:53,577
他们哪来的这些闲工夫
Yeah, where did they have the time?

715
00:47:55,847 --> 00:47:57,847
-天 是张生日卡 -嗯
- Jeez, it's a birthday card. - Yeah.

716
00:47:57,949 --> 00:47:59,315
生日快乐
"Happy birthday.

717
00:47:59,917 --> 00:48:04,685
死去的爱德华 斯塔尔 这也太残忍了不是
Edward starr dead." This is really cruel, right?

718
00:48:04,787 --> 00:48:06,086
简直是病态的
It's very sick.

719
00:48:10,358 --> 00:48:12,725
我关于特里 狄思拓打听到越多
The more I hear about Terri disisto,

720
00:48:12,827 --> 00:48:15,260
她听上去越像简 奥布莱恩
the more she sounds like Jane o'brien.

721
00:48:15,629 --> 00:48:19,430
很明显的 她俩都很喜欢挠痒痒
To state the obvious, they both really enjoy tickling.

722
00:48:19,532 --> 00:48:22,499
她们还喜欢掌控和发飙
They also like being in control and lashing out.

723
00:48:22,601 --> 00:48:24,333
太感谢了 保持联系
I really appreciate it and stay in touch.

724
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,003
而且原来特里的嗜好追溯到
And it turns out Terri's habits started

725
00:48:29,105 --> 00:48:31,438
戴夫 斯塔尔参与的很久之前
way before Dave starr got involved.

726
00:48:31,873 --> 00:48:34,206
我找到一个记者 在九十年代他曾经花了一年探索
I've found a journalist who'd spent a year uncovering

727
00:48:34,308 --> 00:48:37,909
关于特里 狄思拓的真相
the truth about Terri disisto during the '90s.

728
00:48:39,512 --> 00:48:42,246
特里 狄思拓的做法是用这些男孩
Terri disisto's mo was to bait these boys

729
00:48:42,348 --> 00:48:44,348
渴望的东西
into making tickling videos with

730
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:46,383
诱惑他们来拍挠痒视频 是这样吗
things that they wanted, right?

731
00:48:47,185 --> 00:48:48,951
你看 想象一个十几岁的少年
You know, I mean, imagine being a teenage boy,

732
00:48:49,053 --> 00:48:52,054
收到一个莫名其妙的邮件说
and, like, you get this random email saying, you know,

733
00:48:52,156 --> 00:48:54,956
我看到你发的关于这个演唱会的状态 那么
"I saw your posting about the phish concert, and, uh,

734
00:48:55,058 --> 00:48:56,390
你要不要去
how would you like to go?"

735
00:48:56,492 --> 00:48:58,959
或是说 我可以给你一千块现金
Or, " I can send you $1000 cash."

736
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,527
你住在詹姆斯麦迪逊大学[位于弗吉尼亚州的公立大学]的宿舍
And you're like... You're living in your dorm

737
00:49:00,629 --> 00:49:03,429
你会说 行 当然啦
at James Madison university. You're like, "Yeah, sure.

738
00:49:03,531 --> 00:49:06,731
你会给我一千块 才怪
You're gonna send me $1000 cash. Right."

739
00:49:07,734 --> 00:49:10,267
快递第二天就送到你宿舍门口
Fedex pulls up in front of your dorm the next day,

740
00:49:10,369 --> 00:49:13,269
十张百元钞票
and there is ten $100 bills.

741
00:49:13,638 --> 00:49:14,970
不劳而获
You haven't done anything.

742
00:49:17,074 --> 00:49:19,541
他们想要什么她就送什么
She would just keep sending them whatever they wanted,

743
00:49:19,643 --> 00:49:22,877
你知道的 电脑 相机 现金
you know. Computers, cameras, more cash,

744
00:49:23,145 --> 00:49:25,211
摇滚演唱会门票
tickets to rock concerts.

745
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:29,715
不过到了一个阶段 就算一个少年
Then at some point, even a teenage boy

746
00:49:29,817 --> 00:49:31,983
也有愿望都被满足的时刻
has all the toys that they want.

747
00:49:32,885 --> 00:49:35,085
他们会说 我不干了
And they say, "I... I'm done."

748
00:49:36,488 --> 00:49:41,290
我认为她最憎恨的事情就是被拒绝
But I think the thing that she hates the most was no.

749
00:49:41,558 --> 00:49:45,625
就好像引爆了一个炸弹
It was like... A bomb went off.

750
00:49:48,262 --> 00:49:49,728
她会说 那好
And she'd say, "Well,

751
00:49:49,863 --> 00:49:53,731
你要是不干了 我叫你吃不了兜着走
if you don't do it, I'm gonna make your life hell."

752
00:49:55,234 --> 00:49:57,234
我会把这些视频
"I'm gonna send clips of these videos

753
00:49:57,336 --> 00:49:58,802
发给你的摔跤教练
to your wrestling coach."

754
00:49:59,437 --> 00:50:01,837
我会把这些视频发给你妈妈
"I'm gonna send clips of these videos to your mom."

755
00:50:01,939 --> 00:50:04,506
发给你奶奶
"I'm gonna send clips of these videos to your grandmother."

756
00:50:04,608 --> 00:50:06,107
发给你的
"I'm gonna send clips of these videos

757
00:50:06,242 --> 00:50:08,408
大学校长
to the president of your university."

758
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:10,009
发到整个网络上
"I'm gonna post them all over the Internet."

759
00:50:10,244 --> 00:50:12,911
我会假扮成你 在网上胡作非为
"I'm gonna pretend to be you and do things on the Internet

760
00:50:13,013 --> 00:50:15,580
把你的名声搞臭
that are gonna create a terrible reputation for you."

761
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:20,183
我会把你们整个学校的电脑系统搞掉
"I'm gonna shut down the entire college campus computer system

762
00:50:20,285 --> 00:50:23,285
让他们认为是你做的
at your college, and they're gonna think it's you."

763
00:50:25,623 --> 00:50:26,888
她真的这么做了
And then it happened.

764
00:50:41,504 --> 00:50:43,871
我做的第一个报道就是关于
The first story I did was because

765
00:50:44,306 --> 00:50:47,974
她攻击了德雷克塞尔大学
she was attacking, um, drexel university.

766
00:50:49,844 --> 00:50:53,979
我发现有一个学生
And I found the student who, um,

767
00:50:54,748 --> 00:50:56,647
为她拍了几个视频
had made a number of videos for her.

768
00:51:00,185 --> 00:51:03,452
当他去费城上大学
And when he came to Philadelphia to go to college,

769
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,053
她还想让他继续拍这些视频
she wanted him to continue making these videos,

770
00:51:06,155 --> 00:51:09,456
而他想要和她断绝来往
and he wanted to cut off his relationship with her.

771
00:51:09,658 --> 00:51:12,491
她开始全方面地报复
And she retaliated on so many levels.

772
00:51:14,328 --> 00:51:16,094
他们学校邮箱服务器的主机被关掉
Their email servers' computers were being shut down

773
00:51:16,196 --> 00:51:18,162
来阻止
with these denial-of-service attacks

774
00:51:18,264 --> 00:51:20,964
显示是来自这个学生的联机攻击
that indicated that they were coming from him.

775
00:51:24,336 --> 00:51:26,169
用他的名字
Email-bombing the white house,

776
00:51:26,538 --> 00:51:28,571
向白宫群发垃圾邮件
indicating that it came from him.

777
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,473
当你才十九岁 特勤处出现在
Yeah, that's pretty serious stuff when the secret service

778
00:51:32,575 --> 00:51:35,976
你的宿舍门口还是很严重的
shows up in your college dorm and you're 19 years old.

779
00:51:42,616 --> 00:51:45,483
我只是觉得好奇 就想办法
I was just curious, and I somehow

780
00:51:45,585 --> 00:51:49,419
在美国在线上联系到她
started contacting Terri on aol.

781
00:51:49,421 --> 00:51:50,686
她有个账号
She had an account.

782
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:55,690
我们会在深夜聊天
And we would have these chats late at night.

783
00:51:56,592 --> 00:52:00,960
我很好奇这个大名鼎鼎的网络人物脑子里
And I was curious what kind of mind was behind this...

784
00:52:01,629 --> 00:52:03,862
都想着些什么
Celebrated Internet personage.

785
00:52:04,931 --> 00:52:07,798
是些疯狂的想法
And it was, it was kind of crazy.

786
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,599
我们这样聊着
We would have these conversations,

787
00:52:11,602 --> 00:52:12,401
她会
and she would...

788
00:52:12,402 --> 00:52:13,201
当她意识到我喝了葡萄酒 她会说
When she realized that I did wine, she would say,

789
00:52:13,303 --> 00:52:16,370
哦 我在喝一杯霞多丽哪
"Oh, I'm having a glass of chardonnay!"

790
00:52:16,472 --> 00:52:20,473
我完全能想象到她的声音 当它在我脑袋里回荡
And I could just hear this voice because as it went on,

791
00:52:20,575 --> 00:52:23,676
就好像她完全沉醉在
it was almost like she was completely intoxicated

792
00:52:23,911 --> 00:52:27,612
她拥有的对他人
with this power that she had to...

793
00:52:28,214 --> 00:52:30,214
极具破坏性的能力
To be so destructive against people.

794
00:52:40,992 --> 00:52:45,060
我听说有个孩子拒绝继续拍这种视频
I got word about a kid who refused to make the videos.

795
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,297
他在网上求助
He posted that he needed some help,

796
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:51,632
有人说能够帮忙
and somebody said they would help him.

797
00:52:55,304 --> 00:52:57,671
不知怎的他邮件收到一个文档
And somehow he got emailed a file,

798
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:03,008
并被告知 你把这个压缩文档发给特里
and he was told, "If you email this zip file to Terri,

799
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:04,742
她就不会再打搅你了
she will leave you alone."

800
00:53:08,514 --> 00:53:10,380
然后 他把压缩文件发给我了
And then he sent me that zip file.

801
00:53:16,087 --> 00:53:18,653
你知道 我还记得打开它之后在想
You know, and I remember opening it up and thinking...

802
00:53:20,189 --> 00:53:23,657
"哇 就是这个了 这是
"Wow! You know, this is it. Like, this is...

803
00:53:24,092 --> 00:53:25,858
这是确凿的证据"
This is the smoking gun."

804
00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:36,567
这个压缩文件包括她硬盘里的文档
The zip file contained documents from her hard drive.

805
00:53:36,669 --> 00:53:40,436
如我所料 有关于挠痒的视频文件
As expected, there were files relating to tickling shoots.

806
00:53:43,007 --> 00:53:48,110
但它们同时也揭露了特里 挠痒的真身
But they also revealed the true identity of Terri tickle.

807
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:02,390
大卫 迪马托
David d'amato.

808
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,861
她其实是个他 对吗
She is really he, right?

809
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:21,405
他是一所高中的副校长
He was an assistant principal in a high school?

810
00:54:24,343 --> 00:54:25,608
我就是
I just...

811
00:54:28,746 --> 00:54:32,147
没法相信这一点
Couldn't believe it.

812
00:54:32,249 --> 00:54:34,882
我不知道为什么 但这些看上去
I don't know why, but it just seemed...

813
00:54:34,984 --> 00:54:38,785
这就是那个利用这些年轻人的那个虐待狂
Here is this sadistic person exploiting these young people,

814
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,986
通常还是些未成年人
often underage,

815
00:54:42,889 --> 00:54:46,089
让他们的生活狼狈 让他们难堪
making their lives miserable, embarrassing them,

816
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,925
到了如此地步的家伙
to an extent that it's every...

817
00:54:49,027 --> 00:54:52,828
这与一名教育者所应做的所有事情都背道而驰
It goes against everything that an educator should be doing.

818
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:02,937
当我做了一些调查 我发现
When I did some more checking, I found out that

819
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:06,240
他大概在十年内任职过八所学校
he had worked at, like, eight schools in ten years.

820
00:55:07,743 --> 00:55:09,409
这对我来说总是个警示
Which to me was always a red flag

821
00:55:09,511 --> 00:55:10,977
一定有什么不对劲
that there was something else going on.

822
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:13,946
我的意思是 这可不仅仅是单纯的不称职了
I mean, that's more than just sheer incompetence.

823
00:55:16,583 --> 00:55:20,418
然后我找到了她的社会保险号码
And then I found social security numbers for her

824
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,653
发现他犯下了欺诈
that he had gotten fraudulently...

825
00:55:23,422 --> 00:55:25,422
因为冒用了亡者的名字
With dead people's names.

826
00:55:30,094 --> 00:55:34,496
所以我联系了联邦调查局
So I contacted the FBI.

827
00:55:35,866 --> 00:55:38,666
把我所知的一切都告诉了他们
I turned over all my information to them.

828
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:43,670
一周之内 他就被逮捕了
Within a week, they busted him.

829
00:55:56,551 --> 00:55:58,551
我们对判决结果感到震惊
We were shocked at the sentencing

830
00:55:58,753 --> 00:56:01,453
因为他如此轻易地脱身了
because he got off so easy.

831
00:56:01,555 --> 00:56:04,188
对造成了如此多伤害的人来说
For somebody who had done so much damage,

832
00:56:05,457 --> 00:56:07,323
这个结果真是出乎我的意料
to me it was just extraordinary.

833
00:56:08,059 --> 00:56:10,626
甚至还不在这些发生之后
And to not, to not have restrictions on their

834
00:56:10,728 --> 00:56:14,829
限制他们对互联网的访问 怎么回事
Internet access after that, how could...?

835
00:56:15,431 --> 00:56:18,298
还有 对了 他还还去法学院读书
And the... oh! And the idea that he was going to law school

836
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,999
真是荒唐可笑
was just absurd.

837
00:56:22,503 --> 00:56:25,470
事实是大卫 迪马托的父亲 乔治
It turns out David d'amato's father, George,

838
00:56:25,572 --> 00:56:28,306
联合创办了华尔街最大的法律公司之一 迪马托和林奇
co-founded one of wall street's biggest law firms,

839
00:56:28,408 --> 00:56:32,676
大卫得到了一名很优秀的辩护律师
d'amato & lynch, and David got a really great lawyer.

840
00:56:33,178 --> 00:56:36,145
迪马托被允许于父亲的母校 福特汉姆大学 学习法律
Instead of prison, d'amato was allowed to serve his sentence

841
00:56:36,247 --> 00:56:38,247
同时在中途康复站[社区机构]服刑
in the halfway house while he studied law

842
00:56:38,349 --> 00:56:41,916
而不是在监狱里
at his father's Alma mater, Fordham university.

843
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:47,187
法官不知什么原因
The judge, for some reason,

844
00:56:47,289 --> 00:56:50,690
下决心认可这条法学院的途径
decided that he would endorse the law school path, right?

845
00:56:51,592 --> 00:56:53,091
因为 他就是块
Because, like, this is exactly the kind of person

846
00:56:53,193 --> 00:56:54,926
做律师的料 对不对
that should be a lawyer, right?

847
00:56:55,028 --> 00:56:58,262
欺诈他人
Somebody who has defrauded people,

848
00:56:58,364 --> 00:57:00,330
窃取身份
somebody who has stolen people's identities.

849
00:57:00,432 --> 00:57:02,064
这可是联邦重罪 对吗
A federal freakin' crime, right?

850
00:57:02,166 --> 00:57:05,400
我想说的是 比如窃取身份
I mean... like, you know, stolen identity.

851
00:57:05,502 --> 00:57:07,602
盗用一个死去妇女的社保账号
Stolen a social security number of a dead woman,

852
00:57:07,704 --> 00:57:09,670
是两个死人 对吗
of two dead people, right?

853
00:57:12,207 --> 00:57:15,941
上面说 “大卫 迪马托 39岁 住在花园城市
It said, "David d'amato, 39, of garden city,

854
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:18,877
对两件计算机诈骗和滥用计算机的联邦案件
plead guilty for two federal counts of

855
00:57:18,979 --> 00:57:20,378
做出认罪”
computer fraud and abuse."

856
00:57:23,683 --> 00:57:25,883
对挠痒只字不提
Nothing about the tickling,

857
00:57:25,985 --> 00:57:29,853
对男孩们只字不提 对身份窃取只字不提
nothing about the boys, nothing about the identity theft.

858
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,787
只字不提
Zero. Nothing.

859
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:35,724
福特汉姆大学一知道迪马托的定罪结果
Once Fordham became aware of d'amato's convictions,

860
00:57:35,826 --> 00:57:37,792
就取消了他的入学资格
his admission was revoked.

861
00:57:37,894 --> 00:57:39,460
无法继续学习法律的迪马托
No longer able to study law,

862
00:57:39,562 --> 00:57:42,095
在监狱里完成了刑期
d'amato finished his sentence in prison.

863
00:57:42,497 --> 00:57:45,598
但我意识到 这并没有阻止他的挠痒大计
But I've realized that didn't stop the tickling.

864
00:57:46,667 --> 00:57:49,200
这是2002年 这是写给大卫 斯塔尔的信
So, this is 2002. So this is writing to David starr,

865
00:57:49,302 --> 00:57:51,435
大卫拍摄这些男孩挠痒痒的过程
who would shoot these boys tickling

866
00:57:51,537 --> 00:57:53,270
然后把视频发送
and then send the videos...

867
00:57:54,573 --> 00:57:55,705
给特里 那是
To Terri. That was a, that's--

868
00:57:55,807 --> 00:57:58,374
因为她想要的是
because she, what she would have is...

869
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:01,076
-你需要眼镜吗 -早些时候
- Do you want your glasses? - Back in the early days...

870
00:58:01,178 --> 00:58:03,144
好的 早些时候
Yeah. Back in the early days...

871
00:58:05,015 --> 00:58:11,018
特里会让朋友们挠他们的痒 然后发给他们
Terri would have friends tickle them and send them the...

872
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,320
那都是业余的录像带
They were amateur tapes.

873
00:58:13,422 --> 00:58:15,755
-现在变成专业级的了吗 -这就是
- These are now professional? - Well, this is...

874
00:58:15,823 --> 00:58:17,389
-看看上面的日期 -2002年
- Look at the date on it. - '02?

875
00:58:17,491 --> 00:58:18,690
看看日期
Look at the date.

876
00:58:19,659 --> 00:58:22,826
-“T”指的是特里吗 -对 这是特里的字
- Is the "T" Terri? - Yeah, it's Terri writing.

877
00:58:22,928 --> 00:58:27,096
所以那大概还是 他还被关在监狱里的时候
So that was during, um, lock-up time.

878
00:58:27,198 --> 00:58:29,998
哦 在监狱 我知道了
Oh, in jail. I get it.

879
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:35,336
“大卫 还有几件事情 邮件 解释我的病情”
"David, a few other things. Email... explain my illness."

880
00:58:35,438 --> 00:58:37,538
“告诉他一旦我的单核白血球增多症好转
Oh. "Tell him I'll pay everything owed

881
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,574
我就会把所有欠款还清”
as soon as the mono is better."

882
00:58:40,676 --> 00:58:46,245
“来张头部特写” 天呐
Oh. "Get headshots." My god! Oh, my god!

883
00:58:47,648 --> 00:58:53,618
“我病得厉害 所以有段时间不会上网”
"I won't be online for a while as I am very sick." Oh.

884
00:58:59,725 --> 00:59:04,360
-停不下来吧 -当然
- Couldn't stop. - No. No.

885
00:59:06,297 --> 00:59:08,697
似乎自从上世纪90年代中期开始
It seems that since the mid-'90s,

886
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:11,733
大卫 迪马托就没停止各种花招
David d'amato has never stopped finding elaborate ways

887
00:59:11,835 --> 00:59:14,368
让年轻人来挠痒痒
to get young men to tickle each other.

888
00:59:14,903 --> 00:59:16,469
他那特里 蒂克尔的伪装
His persona of Terri tickle

889
00:59:16,571 --> 00:59:20,105
似乎在2006年左右就销声匿迹了
seems to have dropped off the radar around 2006.

890
00:59:20,874 --> 00:59:24,742
过了一段时间 简 奥布莱恩登上了舞台
A while later, Jane o'brien arrived on the scene.

891
00:59:28,547 --> 00:59:30,446
我们把这个推论放到了网上
We've posted this theory online,

892
00:59:30,548 --> 00:59:33,314
大卫 迪马托不太高兴
and David d'amato is not happy.

893
00:59:35,084 --> 00:59:38,752
他雇了不止一个 而是两个私家侦探
He's hired not one, but two private investigators,

894
00:59:38,854 --> 00:59:41,587
一个在新西兰 一个在纽约
one in New Zealand and one in New York.

895
00:59:43,257 --> 00:59:46,958
用意很明确 他们让我们停下手头正在做的事情
The message is clear. They tell us to stop what we're doing

896
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:50,761
并暗示迪马托与简 奥布莱恩媒体毫无关联
and that d'amato has nothing to do with Jane o'brien media.

897
00:59:53,765 --> 00:59:55,498
最绝的是
On top of that,

898
00:59:55,499 --> 00:59:57,232
大卫 迪马托也雇了一名新西兰的律师
David d'amato has also hired a New Zealand lawyer.

899
00:59:57,535 --> 01:00:00,068
他要求道歉并撤回相关报道
He's demanding an apology and retraction

900
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:03,171
否则新西兰法庭上见
or else he'll see us in a New Zealand court.

901
01:00:12,414 --> 01:00:13,579
我们现在遭受两面夹击
We're now being attacked

902
01:00:13,681 --> 01:00:16,014
一边是简 奥布莱恩的律师
by Jane o'brien's lawyers on one side

903
01:00:16,116 --> 01:00:18,449
另一边是大卫 迪马托的律师
and David d'amato's on the other,

904
01:00:18,951 --> 01:00:22,751
双方都坚称他们彼此毫无关系
both insisting they have nothing to do with each other.

905
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,954
我们又一次地不知所措了
Once again, we're way out of our depth.

906
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:30,691
当一通密歇根的电话打来
Things get even more surreal

907
01:00:30,759 --> 01:00:32,692
事情变得更加离奇了
with a phone call from Michigan,

908
01:00:32,794 --> 01:00:35,161
又有一个简组织起来的
where there's a very different tickling operation

909
01:00:35,263 --> 01:00:37,096
很不一样的挠痒痒行动
also being run by Jane.

910
01:01:24,776 --> 01:01:27,076
所以说 在这个地方
So, like, crime is pretty high--

911
01:01:27,244 --> 01:01:28,876
犯罪率非常高 对吗
Yeah-- - ...Here, right?

912
01:01:28,978 --> 01:01:33,813
谋杀 抢劫 强奸 还有盗窃
Murder, robberies, um, rape, I mean, theft.

913
01:01:33,915 --> 01:01:35,681
这里全都有
It's all up there,

914
01:01:35,783 --> 01:01:39,084
特别是考虑到 这个地方并不大
especially for being as small, um, as what it is.

915
01:01:39,186 --> 01:01:41,085
现在 我们获得了
We've made it now, uh,

916
01:01:41,187 --> 01:01:45,555
全美最危险的100个城市之一的称号
on to the top 100 most dangerous cities in the United States.

917
01:01:46,257 --> 01:01:47,990
你觉不觉得 从某种意义上说
Do you think on some level

918
01:01:48,092 --> 01:01:51,359
简是因为这个地方的贫穷才在这里拍摄的
Jane kind of directed things here because it is a poor area?

919
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:55,062
对啊 你知道贫困
Yeah, you know, the poverty level, you know,

920
01:01:55,164 --> 01:01:56,730
-让人失去理智 -嗯
- is easy to target, you know. - Mm.

921
01:01:56,832 --> 01:01:59,265
对小孩子来说 成千上万美元
Thousands of dollars in kids' hands is...

922
01:01:59,367 --> 01:02:01,266
那可是一笔不小的数目
That's a, that's a big, big deal.

923
01:02:48,075 --> 01:02:50,339
简看中了一项
Jane has taken a liking to one

924
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:53,811
马斯基根市的主要运动 综合格斗
of muskegon's main sports, mixed martial arts.

925
01:02:53,913 --> 01:02:58,081
一群年轻 健硕的人极度渴望外快
A group of young, athletic men desperate for extra money.

926
01:03:19,704 --> 01:03:22,771
所以简努力想要突破进这个综合格斗的领域
That's what she was trying to do, is break into the mma world.

927
01:03:23,774 --> 01:03:26,307
因为在综合格斗中 为了避免被制服
Because it's not illegal to tickle somebody

928
01:03:26,409 --> 01:03:29,343
去挠对方的痒痒 并不算犯规
to get out of a submission in mixed martial arts.

929
01:03:30,112 --> 01:03:31,611
她试图去利用这一点
Like, she was trying to pitch that

930
01:03:31,713 --> 01:03:32,611
因为
because she, like,

931
01:03:32,613 --> 01:03:35,347
她查阅了所有规则和相关资料
looked it up in all the rules and everything.

932
01:03:36,283 --> 01:03:39,784
不过你在比赛中途通过挠痒痒
But if you tickle a guy in the middle of that ring

933
01:03:39,886 --> 01:03:41,485
使对手屈服
to get out of a submission,

934
01:03:41,587 --> 01:03:44,187
你走出擂台观众都会给你一巴掌
you might step out of the cage and get punched in the face.

935
01:03:44,923 --> 01:03:49,525
就像是 再过个几千年我格斗都不会
Like, never in a million years out of all my fights

936
01:03:49,693 --> 01:03:52,326
去挠痒痒
would I ever try to tickle somebody

937
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:55,862
来获胜 绝不可能
to get out of a submission. Fuck, no!

938
01:04:13,143 --> 01:04:14,609
作为一名前搏击手
As an ex-fighter,

939
01:04:14,711 --> 01:04:18,179
乔丹受雇在镇子里招募挠痒人才
Jordan was paid to recruit tickling talent in the town.

940
01:04:18,281 --> 01:04:22,115
他是唯一一个愿意上镜的马斯基根人
He's the only one in muskegon prepared to appear on camera.

941
01:04:23,418 --> 01:04:29,621
她给一个我找的人开价 一辆2014款雪佛兰科鲁兹和三万美元
She offered my one buddy a 2014 Chevy cruze and $30,000.

942
01:04:30,056 --> 01:04:32,222
-为什么 去挠痒吗 -对啊
- What? What for? To tickle? - Yeah.

943
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:35,691
只是因为 她喜欢他
Just 'cause, like, she liked him.

944
01:04:35,793 --> 01:04:36,958
没错 他曾是她的最爱
Yeah, right. She... He was a favorite.

945
01:04:37,126 --> 01:04:38,492
-就像 对 -对
- Like, yeah. - Yeah.

946
01:04:38,594 --> 01:04:41,027
亚洲人和红毛都是他们口中的优质人选
Asians and redheads are what they call premiums.

947
01:04:41,129 --> 01:04:43,529
如果你找到了 她会给你奖金
If you get those, like, she gives you bonuses.

948
01:04:44,164 --> 01:04:46,130
我是乔丹 史基拉斯 这里是CET活动
I'm Jordan schillaci, and this is cet.

949
01:04:46,232 --> 01:04:48,398
今天 我们即将进行一次讨论而非辩论
Uh, we're gonna be having a discussion,

950
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:51,234
关于是否在搏斗的情况中
more of a debate today about whether tickling

951
01:04:51,336 --> 01:04:54,470
挠痒是有效的
is effective in a combat situation.

952
01:04:58,809 --> 01:05:00,642
我们最后还建了个挠痒室 就是
We ended up setting up a tickle cell. Like,

953
01:05:00,844 --> 01:05:02,043
你把找到的人带进去
where you get guys to come in,

954
01:05:02,145 --> 01:05:04,812
“我们给你酬金 你付钱让他们面试”
"We'll pay you and you pay them to audition."

955
01:05:04,914 --> 01:05:07,747
别
No!

956
01:05:10,284 --> 01:05:12,851
所以我们会挑个旅社 普普通通的
So we'd choose a hotel, nothing fancy,

957
01:05:12,953 --> 01:05:16,988
人们会走来走去 到处乱逛
and, uh, the guys would come in and hang out, you know,

958
01:05:17,090 --> 01:05:21,391
抽烟 喝酒 吃披萨 上床
smoke, drink, eat pizza, fuckin', and we'd hurry up

959
01:05:21,493 --> 01:05:24,894
我们就赶快把五到七个受试者过一遍
and run through, you know, five, six, seven guys.

960
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:32,934
所以说 你就负责马斯基根市的挠痒室吗
So you're... you were looking after the tickle cell in muskegon?

961
01:05:33,036 --> 01:05:35,202
对 他们遍布全美
Yeah, they have them set up all over the us.

962
01:05:35,304 --> 01:05:39,072
俄亥俄 密歇根 佛罗里达 纽约
Ohio, Michigan, Florida, New York.

963
01:05:39,174 --> 01:05:41,040
-他们无处不在 -确实
- I mean, they're everywhere. - Right.

964
01:05:41,175 --> 01:05:43,175
-他们都是简旗下的吗 -对
- And they're all for Jane? - Yeah.

965
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:45,076
真是可怕
Fuckin' hell.

966
01:05:51,116 --> 01:05:52,582
就是那里 许多人开始
Well, that's where a lot of people started

967
01:05:52,684 --> 01:05:54,383
变得非常非常焦虑
getting really really upset, man.

968
01:05:54,485 --> 01:05:55,717
因为冷不防地
Because all of sudden these videos

969
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:57,885
这些本来只是面试的视频出现在油管
that are supposed to be just auditions were on YouTube,

970
01:05:57,887 --> 01:06:00,888
Vimeo 还有所有你能想到的网站
vimeo, and every other site you could imagine.

971
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:03,289
-的确是这样 -没人会一笑而过
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Nobody was okay with that.

972
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:07,292
有一个人 叫布罗迪
One of the guys, Brodie,

973
01:06:07,394 --> 01:06:10,561
他的家庭对此非常烦恼 视频到处都是
like, his family was very upset with him. It was all over.

974
01:06:10,663 --> 01:06:13,330
人们对他都不断地指指点点
Like, people just picked on him and picked on him.

975
01:06:14,066 --> 01:06:17,000
他还是未成年人 还在上学
You know, he was underage, still in school.

976
01:06:17,302 --> 01:06:19,568
这件事不应该泄露到互联网上
And it wasn't supposed to go out on the Internet.

977
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:22,337
就根本不应该发上去
It wasn't supposed to be put up, and, uh,

978
01:06:22,472 --> 01:06:26,173
真的是糟糕透顶
you know, that just kind of sucked.

979
01:06:26,275 --> 01:06:28,408
像我说过的那样 它让布罗迪
Because, like I said, it took Brodie...

980
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:29,842
它给了致命一击
It hit one of the hardest.

981
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:31,476
先是这整个突然的情况
Like, this whole situation

982
01:06:31,578 --> 01:06:33,978
然后又是未成年 又是他的父母
and then being underage and his parents.

983
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:36,213
你要去向谁求助 你要去攻击谁
Who do you have to turn to? Who are you going to attack?

984
01:06:36,315 --> 01:06:39,749
没人 简 奥布莱恩是一个幽灵 没人知道它的真实身份
No... Jane o'brien's a ghost. Nobody knows who it is.

985
01:06:41,953 --> 01:06:43,552
小科迪 别
Cody-bear, no.

986
01:06:44,521 --> 01:06:47,054
这是科尔顿 我的外甥
This is Colton, this is my nephew.

987
01:06:47,156 --> 01:06:48,922
-嘿 小伙子 -科尔顿 你多大了
- Hey, man. - Colton, how old are you?

988
01:06:49,925 --> 01:06:51,224
你多大了
How old are you?

989
01:06:51,426 --> 01:06:52,691
-三岁 -三岁啦
- Three. - You're three?

990
01:06:52,793 --> 01:06:54,325
真三岁吗 好吧
You're three? All right.

991
01:06:55,127 --> 01:06:57,193
-我是大卫 -我是菲尔 你好
- I'm David. - I'm Phil. How are you doing?

992
01:06:57,295 --> 01:06:58,560
很高兴见到你 先生
It's nice to meet you, sir.

993
01:06:59,629 --> 01:07:02,062
当乔丹开始谈论这件事情
I was really, really reluctant

994
01:07:02,164 --> 01:07:03,696
我心里一百个不愿意
when Jordan started talking about this.

995
01:07:03,831 --> 01:07:06,932
他说 “妈妈 这个女人看上去正直而守法”
And he's like, "This lady seems straight and legit, mom."

996
01:07:07,034 --> 01:07:10,335
我就说 “这些男孩还年轻”
I'm like, you know, "These... these boys are young."

997
01:07:10,437 --> 01:07:13,871
太轻易就相信 不过当你年岁渐长
It's easy to believe, but when you're an old mom,

998
01:07:14,306 --> 01:07:17,073
你就对男孩子们多了个心眼
you're a little more leery for the boys, and,

999
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:20,209
我一开始就察觉到不对
I was very leery right from get-go

1000
01:07:20,311 --> 01:07:22,377
孩子们会麻烦缠身
that the boys were gonna get into trouble

1001
01:07:22,479 --> 01:07:24,278
这根本不正当
and this was not legit.

1002
01:07:34,622 --> 01:07:36,521
她像是富可敌国
She has all the money in the world, it seems like,

1003
01:07:36,623 --> 01:07:38,856
无论是谁 她有可以满足
whoever it is, to be able to do this.

1004
01:07:38,958 --> 01:07:42,258
不过他们等到你开始依赖
But they're waiting for that day that you rely

1005
01:07:43,027 --> 01:07:45,193
将其作为最后的救命稻草
on that as a sole income.

1006
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:47,561
那才是她至高的权利之旅
That was her big, I think, power trip.

1007
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:51,297
她等到我们都依靠那份收入
She waited until a bunch of us relied on that income

1008
01:07:51,399 --> 01:07:53,932
因为那是我们唯一的生财之道
because that was our only source of income.

1009
01:07:54,034 --> 01:07:55,767
我们深陷其中 我们不想
We'd been doing it for so long, we didn't think...

1010
01:07:55,869 --> 01:07:58,469
等到她有绝对的控制权
She waited until she had complete control,

1011
01:07:58,571 --> 01:08:00,938
基本上 你到那种地步
basically, over your situation,

1012
01:08:01,307 --> 01:08:02,806
她就会开始
and that's when she wanted to yank that rug

1013
01:08:02,908 --> 01:08:04,440
釜底抽薪
right out from under you.

1014
01:08:09,313 --> 01:08:12,480
大卫 迪马托 你听说过这个名字吗
David d'amato. Have you heard that name before?

1015
01:08:13,015 --> 01:08:14,647
和这些有关系吗
In relation to all this stuff?

1016
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:19,250
就是字面上你意思 颤抖了
I am literally, like, trembling right now.

1017
01:08:19,352 --> 01:08:20,451
你真的在发抖吗
Are you actually shaking?

1018
01:08:20,453 --> 01:08:24,555
是啊 我实际上 就在 颤抖 我没 
Yeah, I'm actually, like, shaking. Like, I'm not, like...

1019
01:08:24,657 --> 01:08:27,591
就像我说的 从这里起 我都没在乎
Like I said, like, from being from here, I don't take shit.

1020
01:08:27,693 --> 01:08:30,794
就像 要是我遇到这家伙 一定会给他当头一击
Like, if I met up with that guy, I'd punch him right out.

1021
01:08:30,896 --> 01:08:33,096
等他醒来 会发现被绑在椅子上
And when he woke up, he'd be strapped to a chair with a...

1022
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:34,263
我就像这样
Like, I'd be like,

1023
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:35,797
兄弟 现在一切老实交待
"Dude, you're telling me everything right now."

1024
01:08:43,072 --> 01:08:45,405
在这城镇上挠痒痒还在继续
The tickling's still happening in this town.

1025
01:08:45,907 --> 01:08:48,007
这钱仿佛源源不竭
The money is endless.

1026
01:08:48,109 --> 01:08:51,276
它永不止歇地流入
I've never seen it stop coming and just flowing in.

1027
01:08:51,378 --> 01:08:53,111
不仅仅在密歇根 洛杉矶
And it's not just through Michigan and la,

1028
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:54,345
它无处不在
it's everywhere.

1029
01:08:55,014 --> 01:08:58,949
比如 英格兰 澳大利亚 意大利
Like, england, Australia, Italy.

1030
01:08:59,051 --> 01:09:01,985
钱一直都来来去去
I mean, the money's still coming and going.

1031
01:09:06,424 --> 01:09:07,790
这个挠痒帝国
This tickling empire

1032
01:09:07,892 --> 01:09:10,291
远比我们想象的要庞大
is way bigger than we ever imagined.

1033
01:09:12,261 --> 01:09:15,328
我们要去纽约寻找大卫 迪马托
We're going to New York to find David d'amato.

1034
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:56,666
我都能闻到那富得流油的味道
I can feel the rich/bad aura.

1035
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:02,204
大卫 迪马托的地址位于花园城市
David d'amato's address is listed in garden city,

1036
01:10:02,306 --> 01:10:04,705
长岛的富人区
an affluent suburb of long island.

1037
01:10:07,309 --> 01:10:09,876
他住在那栋楼的顶层
He lives on the top floor of this building.

1038
01:10:11,412 --> 01:10:12,577
这里是兰斯 罗伯特
Lance Roberts speaking.

1039
01:10:12,679 --> 01:10:14,345
噢 你好 我是大卫
Oh, hi. It's David speaking.

1040
01:10:14,447 --> 01:10:17,080
我想跟大卫 迪马托聊一聊
I just wanted to talk to David d'amato.

1041
01:10:17,449 --> 01:10:20,216
额 知道了 我不能给你他的号码
Um, okay. I can't give you his phone number.

1042
01:10:20,351 --> 01:10:21,516
我真的不能提供任何
I really can't even give you any

1043
01:10:21,618 --> 01:10:23,317
他的私人信息
personal information on him.

1044
01:10:23,752 --> 01:10:24,817
好吧
Okay.

1045
01:10:25,252 --> 01:10:26,551
你认识他吗
Do you know him?

1046
01:10:26,653 --> 01:10:29,353
-是的 我认识 -你是他的朋友吗
- Yes, I do. Yes. - You're a friend of his?

1047
01:10:29,455 --> 01:10:32,155
额 我不是他的朋友 不是 不过 我
Um, I'm not a friend, no, but I've, um...

1048
01:10:32,257 --> 01:10:33,756
我一直尝试联系他
I've been trying to get in touch with him

1049
01:10:33,858 --> 01:10:35,224
一直都无果
but have been struggling.

1050
01:10:36,026 --> 01:10:37,091
好的 我能做的就是
Okay, what I do is,

1051
01:10:37,193 --> 01:10:39,026
给他捎个口信
I have a way of leaving him a message.

1052
01:10:39,962 --> 01:10:42,195
我不能保证如果他都不认识你
I can't guarantee that he's gonna call you back

1053
01:10:42,297 --> 01:10:43,396
还会回电
if he doesn't know you.

1054
01:10:43,398 --> 01:10:46,265
-好的 非常感谢你 -不客气
- Okay, thank you so much. Bye. - You're welcome.

1055
01:10:53,705 --> 01:10:55,671
迪马托 从未回电
D'amato never calls us back,

1056
01:10:55,773 --> 01:10:58,907
我们也没有别的直接联系方式
and we've got no other way to contact him directly.

1057
01:11:01,177 --> 01:11:02,442
如此苦恼
So annoying.

1058
01:11:08,349 --> 01:11:10,415
没关系 还有明天呢
It's all right. There's still tomorrow.

1059
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:17,419
不过当晚我们接到了个让人沮丧的电话
But that night we get a frustrating phone call.

1060
01:11:18,722 --> 01:11:21,355
我的忧虑是在我们之后的行程中
My concern is that we can't do more or less anything

1061
01:11:21,457 --> 01:11:23,123
完全束手无策了
we have planned for the rest of the trip.

1062
01:11:24,526 --> 01:11:26,358
我知道 只是 都快发疯了
I know. It's, like, it's fuckin' insane.

1063
01:11:28,395 --> 01:11:30,060
好的 拜拜
Okay. Bye-bye.

1064
01:11:32,898 --> 01:11:35,865
所有威胁都让我们电影制片人焦虑
All the threats are worrying our film's producer.

1065
01:11:35,967 --> 01:11:37,700
他不想让我们冒险激起
He doesn't want us to risk provoking

1066
01:11:37,802 --> 01:11:40,302
迪马托进一步的法律行动
any further legal action from d'amato.

1067
01:11:40,837 --> 01:11:41,735
所以他说
So he's saying,

1068
01:11:41,737 --> 01:11:43,603
你们可不可以不要追着迪马托跑
"Well, what if you do everything that you were gonna do,

1069
01:11:43,605 --> 01:11:45,805
其他怎么弄都行
except don't go and chase d'amato down?"

1070
01:11:45,907 --> 01:11:47,539
我就说 我们所做的一切
And I'm like, "Well, anything we do

1071
01:11:47,641 --> 01:11:49,574
都会让迪马托知道
that lets d'amato know we're looking into him again."

1072
01:11:49,676 --> 01:11:51,542
-嗯 现在起就是这样 -嗯 就是这样
- Well, from now on in is that. - Yeah, literally.

1073
01:11:51,644 --> 01:11:54,310
所以他说 嗯 要不我们直接一点
So he says, "Well, maybe we cut the thing short, then.

1074
01:11:55,146 --> 01:11:56,445
你们回来吧
Just go home."

1075
01:11:57,481 --> 01:11:59,314
我知道 简直是疯了一样
I know it's like... It's fuckin' insane.

1076
01:12:09,559 --> 01:12:12,927
第二天我们就抓了迪马托个正着
The next day we put chasing d'amato on hold.

1077
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,232
我很好奇到底
I want to know how on earth

1078
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,767
一个前副校长哪来这么多钱
a former deputy principal pays for all this.

1079
01:12:21,369 --> 01:12:24,770
我们找不到任何他从这些视频中获利的迹象
We can't find any sign he's earning money from the videos,

1080
01:12:24,872 --> 01:12:27,505
反倒是他斥巨资拍这些视频
but he's spending lots of money making them.

1081
01:12:28,007 --> 01:12:31,341
每个月送多达十个人从世界各地
He's flying up to ten people into la almost every month

1082
01:12:31,443 --> 01:12:33,376
飞去洛杉矶
from all over the world,

1083
01:12:33,478 --> 01:12:35,010
安排到挺好的酒店
putting them up in a nice hotel,

1084
01:12:35,112 --> 01:12:37,445
给他们上千的现金
paying them thousands in cash.

1085
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,546
这还没算上
And that's not even taking into account

1086
01:12:39,648 --> 01:12:40,947
像在马斯基根
the cost of running tickle cells,

1087
01:12:41,049 --> 01:12:42,882
维持挠痒室的开销
like the one in muskegon.

1088
01:12:44,952 --> 01:12:47,118
大卫的双亲都已去世
Both David's parents are now deceased,

1089
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:50,087
不过他父亲留下华尔街最大的法律事务所
but his father's law firm is one of wall street's biggest.

1090
01:12:50,856 --> 01:12:53,022
可能大卫也受益于
Maybe David is reaping the benefits

1091
01:12:53,024 --> 01:12:54,757
他父亲留下的帝国
of his father's empire.

1092
01:12:57,328 --> 01:12:58,593
迪马托和林奇
D'amato & lynch.

1093
01:12:58,695 --> 01:13:02,595
噢 嗨 我想问一下 额
Oh, hi. I just had an inquiry, um,

1094
01:13:02,697 --> 01:13:06,298
大卫 迪马托 嗯
about the relationship with, uh, um,

1095
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:10,935
和公司的关系 就是那个乔治 迪马托的儿子
David d'amato with the company, the son of George d'amato.

1096
01:13:11,037 --> 01:13:13,037
我还能向谁咨询
Is there someone I could talk to about this?

1097
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:18,874
无可奉告 很抱歉 迪马托先生已经去世很久了
No, I'm sorry. And Mr. D'amato has been gone for a long time.

1098
01:13:19,243 --> 01:13:24,645
是 是 我在调查他的儿子 大卫
Yeah, yeah. I'm looking into the background to his son, David.

1099
01:13:24,747 --> 01:13:26,580
我只是想知道他是否
And I'm just trying to figure out whether he's got

1100
01:13:26,682 --> 01:13:29,716
还和公司有经济关系
any financial relationship with the company still.

1101
01:13:29,818 --> 01:13:33,452
我 我确实不知道 抱歉 爱莫能助
No, I... I really don't know. I'm sorry, I can't help you.

1102
01:13:33,554 --> 01:13:37,422
公司里面我还能问谁这个问题吗
Is there someone I could talk to at d'amato & lynch to find out?

1103
01:13:38,358 --> 01:13:41,759
额 我觉得没有 抱歉
Mm. Not that I believe, no. I'm sorry.

1104
01:13:41,861 --> 01:13:44,328
好的 不过总有方法查明 绝对的
Okay, but there must be a way to find out, surely?

1105
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:48,765
-额 至少这里没有 谢谢你
- Um, not here. Thank you.

1106
01:14:01,079 --> 01:14:04,480
我几年都没见到大卫了
I haven't seen David in quite a few years.

1107
01:14:04,582 --> 01:14:06,148
我对他一无所知
I have no knowledge of him now.

1108
01:14:06,783 --> 01:14:09,483
我几年都没跟他联系过了
Not in many years have I had any contact with him,

1109
01:14:09,585 --> 01:14:11,751
所以我什么消息都无法提供
so I really couldn't give you any information.

1110
01:14:11,853 --> 01:14:14,787
是 他一直都很针对我
Yeah, he's been pretty aggressive towards me,

1111
01:14:14,889 --> 01:14:17,589
我只是想知道他的动机
so I'm just trying to figure out what his motivations are--

1112
01:14:17,691 --> 01:14:19,791
离他远点 我只能说这么多
Get away from him, that's all I can tell you.

1113
01:14:20,693 --> 01:14:23,860
是吗 -对 离他远点
Really? - Yeah. Stay away from him.

1114
01:14:35,139 --> 01:14:37,105
这就是我和每一个
This was every conversation I had

1115
01:14:37,207 --> 01:14:40,808
与大卫 迪马托相关的人士的聊天缩影
with anyone even remotely related to David d'amato.

1116
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:44,044
我无可奉告 劝你不要插手
"I can't tell you anything, but stay away."

1117
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:46,613
不过我所做的恰恰相反
But all I want to do is the opposite.

1118
01:14:46,715 --> 01:14:50,183
总有人要正视这些欺凌 诉讼
Someone has to confront this bully, lawsuits or not.

1119
01:15:04,131 --> 01:15:08,166
好了 这辆车是我们的目标
Okay. So, this is the car we're looking for.

1120
01:15:08,268 --> 01:15:11,902
梅赛德斯 奔驰 ML430
It's a Mercedes benz ml430.

1121
01:15:17,675 --> 01:15:20,876
大卫 迪马托肯定另寻他路避开我们
David d'amato has gone out of his way to avoid us.

1122
01:15:20,978 --> 01:15:23,845
我们猜想要是在他公寓门口等得足够久
We figure if we wait outside his apartment long enough,

1123
01:15:23,947 --> 01:15:25,913
他终究会出来的
eventually he'll have to leave.

1124
01:15:26,916 --> 01:15:29,082
那是辆雪佛兰
So, that's a Chevrolet.

1125
01:15:30,318 --> 01:15:31,684
等下 这是什么
Oh, hang on a second, what's this?

1126
01:15:31,786 --> 01:15:32,885
这是什么 什么
What's this? What's this?

1127
01:15:33,687 --> 01:15:35,219
看到了 那里有辆车
Okay, there's a car there. I can see it.

1128
01:15:35,321 --> 01:15:37,487
现在就在边上 等下
Now, just in the edge. Hang on.

1129
01:15:43,528 --> 01:15:44,994
一辆加大自由光 [Jeep车型]
A grand cherokee.

1130
01:15:46,964 --> 01:15:48,229
嗯 可能就是辆普通的自由光
Well, maybe just a cherokee.

1131
01:15:48,331 --> 01:15:50,197
不过肯定不是奔驰
But it's certainly not a Mercedes.

1132
01:15:56,171 --> 01:15:59,372
几点了 -2:44
What's the time? -  2:44.

1133
01:15:59,474 --> 01:16:02,374
所以我们已经等了大概四个小时了
So we've been here for, like, four hours?

1134
01:16:06,446 --> 01:16:09,246
我们都已经蹲守几天了
We've been waiting like this for days.

1135
01:16:10,515 --> 01:16:11,580
别说了
Come on.

1136
01:16:11,582 --> 01:16:14,616
这情形看起来他根本不会出门
And it seems like he'll never come out.

1137
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:18,586
好吧 我看下 也是辆
Okay. Let me just check. It's also...

1138
01:16:18,688 --> 01:16:23,724
就是这个型号 还有白色底盘
It is the right type of car. It's got white plates.

1139
01:16:24,359 --> 01:16:26,192
等下 等下
Hang on. Hang on. Okay.

1140
01:16:27,995 --> 01:16:29,594
是他 就是他 千真万确
It's him. It's him. It's him. It's him.

1141
01:16:32,966 --> 01:16:34,932
他出来了 在这儿等着
He's coming out. Just wait here.

1142
01:16:35,034 --> 01:16:37,300
就在这儿坐着 没事儿的
Just sit here. All right, stay cool.

1143
01:16:38,403 --> 01:16:39,735
好了 我要
Okay, I'm gonna...

1144
01:16:46,876 --> 01:16:48,208
嗯 他在这里
Okay, he's up here.

1145
01:16:55,883 --> 01:16:57,749
他在右边这条道 他不是在左边吗
He's in the right-hand... Is he in the left-hand Lane?

1146
01:16:57,851 --> 01:16:59,150
是的
Yeah.

1147
01:17:02,353 --> 01:17:03,585
他还没开向右边 他在
He hasn't turned right. He's in...

1148
01:17:03,687 --> 01:17:04,752
哇 你和他就隔着一辆车
Whoa! You're one car behind him.

1149
01:17:04,854 --> 01:17:07,621
你就在他的 后视镜里
You're right in his... In his mirror now.

1150
01:17:25,838 --> 01:17:28,437
-我要喘不过气来了 -嗯 我也是
- I'm breathing heavily. - Yeah, same.

1151
01:17:29,606 --> 01:17:32,106
好的 好的 没事
Okay. Okay. It's cool.

1152
01:17:32,241 --> 01:17:34,107
我们就在他正后方 后退一点
We're right behind him now, so back off a bit,

1153
01:17:34,209 --> 01:17:35,674
我们不要靠太近
so we're not gonna be too close.

1154
01:17:37,778 --> 01:17:39,344
好的
Okay.

1155
01:17:40,714 --> 01:17:43,114
就后退 后退 大卫
Just stay... stay back. Stay back, David.

1156
01:17:43,416 --> 01:17:44,948
我们就停在他后面
We're gonna have to stop right behind him now.

1157
01:17:45,050 --> 01:17:47,016
你可能要把摄影机从三脚架上拿下来
You might have to take the camera off the tripod, dom.

1158
01:17:48,185 --> 01:17:49,951
对 请把摄影机拿开
Yeah, camera off tripod, please.

1159
01:17:51,721 --> 01:17:52,986
星巴克 完美
Starbucks? Okay, this is perfect.

1160
01:17:53,088 --> 01:17:54,287
好 他要出去一会儿
Okay. He'll be a while.

1161
01:17:55,556 --> 01:17:57,855
好了 我就过去等他出来谈一谈
Okay. I'm just gonna go and have conversation when he comes out.

1162
01:18:00,059 --> 01:18:01,858
你有我号码的 要需要打给我
You've... I've got my phone if you need me.

1163
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,292
没问题
Okay.

1164
01:18:15,372 --> 01:18:17,171
我马上就要见到这个人了
I'm about to meet this man who's been

1165
01:18:17,273 --> 01:18:18,672
他威胁着众多人
such a threatening figure

1166
01:18:18,774 --> 01:18:21,974
也包括我
in so many lives, including my own,

1167
01:18:23,711 --> 01:18:26,878
我完全不知道应该期待什么
and I have simply no idea what to expect.

1168
01:18:52,004 --> 01:18:55,138
他出来了 -迪马托先生
He's coming out. - Mr. D'amato.

1169
01:18:55,907 --> 01:18:58,474
嗨 我是我是大卫 法瑞尔
Hi, it's Dave farrier.

1170
01:18:58,576 --> 01:19:00,208
嘿 你怎么样
Hey, how are you?

1171
01:19:03,411 --> 01:19:06,377
我就想简短地跟你说几句
I just wanted to talk to you briefly.

1172
01:19:07,246 --> 01:19:08,545
如果可以的话
If I could.

1173
01:19:09,781 --> 01:19:12,314
因为我有点 有点担心
Because I was just... I'm just worried about...

1174
01:19:15,419 --> 01:19:16,851
你寄给我的律师函
The legal letters you've sent me,

1175
01:19:16,986 --> 01:19:18,385
我就想我们能否
and I just wanted to know if we could

1176
01:19:18,588 --> 01:19:20,287
面对面谈一下
just talk about it face-to-face.

1177
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:24,590
在这里
Is there?

1178
01:19:35,201 --> 01:19:38,101
我签的记者签证 所以我这么做没问题
I'm on a journalism visa, so I'm, I'm okay to be here.

1179
01:19:38,203 --> 01:19:40,035
我这么做没问题 不过我
I'm okay to be here. But I just...

1180
01:19:42,205 --> 01:19:43,938
我们能不能谈一点
Could we just talk a little bit about--

1181
01:19:44,907 --> 01:19:46,973
我就是想知道这都怎么回事
I just wanted to find out what's going on.

1182
01:19:48,642 --> 01:19:52,142
因为走之前我收到你说法庭上见
Because the last heard I was gonna be in a us court

1183
01:19:52,277 --> 01:19:53,376
新西兰的法庭上见
and a New Zealand court,

1184
01:19:53,378 --> 01:19:56,011
我就想面对面把这事儿理清
and I really just wanted to sort this out face-to-face.

1185
01:19:57,447 --> 01:19:58,779
我只是想
And I just want to sort of...

1186
01:19:58,881 --> 01:20:00,280
嗯 我来这儿不是来惹恼你的
I mean, I'm not here to antagonize.

1187
01:20:00,382 --> 01:20:02,815
我真心打算把这事处理好
I just genuinely want to be able to help out.

1188
01:20:05,252 --> 01:20:07,051
嗯 你确实说过你要起诉我
Well, you did say you were gonna sue me.

1189
01:20:07,319 --> 01:20:09,152
我就想把这事解决了
And I just wanna sort this issue out.

1190
01:20:12,423 --> 01:20:14,389
如果可以务必联系我
Could you contact me if possible?

1191
01:20:38,914 --> 01:20:41,147
我走的时候都感觉不知所云
I went away feeling numb.

1192
01:20:41,415 --> 01:20:45,182
迪马托很冷静 一直在说律师函的事
D'amato was calm, going instantly to legal threats,

1193
01:20:45,684 --> 01:20:49,352
我猜 他伪装成特里 伪装成简的时候
which is what he's always done, I suppose, as Terri,

1194
01:20:49,854 --> 01:20:51,186
或者他本来
as Jane,

1195
01:20:51,821 --> 01:20:53,020
就经常干这事
as himself.

1196
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:02,727
经历了这一切 我忍不住好奇
But after all this, I still couldn't help but wonder

1197
01:21:02,829 --> 01:21:04,728
到底迪马托是不是
were we totally certain that d'amato

1198
01:21:04,830 --> 01:21:08,164
简或者黛比 难道真的是我们错了
really was Jane and Debbie? Could we be wrong?

1199
01:21:09,333 --> 01:21:11,666
所以我们又重回原点
So we went back to where it all started,

1200
01:21:11,768 --> 01:21:13,267
那300个
those 300 domain names

1201
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:16,002
和Nederdietsen有关的域名
connected to the nederdietsen group.

1202
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:21,339
在这时事情变得有些不可思议了
And that's when things went a little crazy.

1203
01:21:21,841 --> 01:21:23,240
那些域名之中
On one of those domain names

1204
01:21:23,342 --> 01:21:25,342
有一个目录
there was just a directory listing,

1205
01:21:25,677 --> 01:21:28,577
包含着一个叫做我的文件的文件夹
including a folder called "My documents".

1206
01:21:32,015 --> 01:21:33,781
看起来迪马托好像不小心
It looks like d'amato has accidently

1207
01:21:33,883 --> 01:21:36,750
把上百个他的私人文件都在
made hundreds of his private files public

1208
01:21:37,152 --> 01:21:38,518
互联网上公之于众了
on the Internet.

1209
01:21:44,158 --> 01:21:45,891
里面有Nederdietsen的注册表
There's d'amato's signature

1210
01:21:45,959 --> 01:21:48,792
是以迪马托的名义签的名
on a nederdietsen registration form.

1211
01:21:51,696 --> 01:21:54,463
还有一张他和雇佣调查我们的
There's also a contract with the investigation company

1212
01:21:54,565 --> 01:21:56,197
侦探公司的合同
he hired to look into us.

1213
01:21:56,666 --> 01:21:58,465
地址和简 奥布莱恩媒体
The address is exactly the same

1214
01:21:58,567 --> 01:22:00,900
在新西兰的希尔顿预定房间时用的地址
as the address used by Jane o'brien media

1215
01:22:01,002 --> 01:22:03,902
一模一样
when booking rooms at the Hilton in New Zealand.

1216
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:08,973
还有那些黛比 库恩和简 奥布莱恩的
Then there are documents and signatures

1217
01:22:09,075 --> 01:22:11,741
签名和文件
for Debbie kuhn and Jane o'brien...

1218
01:22:13,644 --> 01:22:16,244
我们也找到了她的信用卡
Who's also got her own credit card.

1219
01:22:17,413 --> 01:22:18,879
结果证明迪马托真的在
And it turns out that d'amato

1220
01:22:19,014 --> 01:22:21,147
斯特拉大学2011年
did finally get that law degree,

1221
01:22:21,249 --> 01:22:24,250
拿到了法学学位
from hofstra university in 2011.

1222
01:22:26,387 --> 01:22:29,388
他一直在告诉那些男孩子们
He's also been telling the boys to enter the United States

1223
01:22:29,490 --> 01:22:32,557
靠旅游签证进入美国 就算他们接受了有偿工作 [违反移民条例]
on a tourist visa, even though they're working.

1224
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:35,559
我终于明白
And it's finally clear to me

1225
01:22:35,661 --> 01:22:37,927
他是怎么建立被挠帝国的了
how he funds his tickling empire.

1226
01:22:40,097 --> 01:22:41,663
2012年底的时候
As of late 2012,

1227
01:22:41,765 --> 01:22:45,098
他的活期存款大概有六百万
he had almost six million in his checking account.

1228
01:22:46,234 --> 01:22:48,968
他的生活开销来自于他爸爸的
And his living expenses were being paid by a trust

1229
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:50,969
信托基金
established by his father.

1230
01:22:54,441 --> 01:22:57,275
当她妈妈2014年去世的时候
He also inherited millions from his mother's estate

1231
01:22:57,377 --> 01:22:59,409
他继承了他妈妈的数百万遗产
when she died in 2014.

1232
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:03,946
钱全部都是家里面的
It's all family money.

1233
01:23:07,551 --> 01:23:09,484
还有很多邮件
There are also lots of emails

1234
01:23:09,586 --> 01:23:12,019
是简 奥布莱恩的雇佣律师寄来的
sent from Jane o'brien's legal department.

1235
01:23:13,288 --> 01:23:17,089
想到这儿 我们打电话给了
With this in mind, we call in to see Romeo salta,

1236
01:23:17,191 --> 01:23:19,491
受雇于简 奥布莱恩的罗密欧 萨尔塔律师
the lawyer hired by Jane o'brien media

1237
01:23:19,593 --> 01:23:22,093
那个一直用诉讼威胁我们的律师
who's been sending us all the legal threats.

1238
01:23:22,862 --> 01:23:25,162
我们想问问他那些从他办公室寄出来的信
We want to ask him about the correspondence

1239
01:23:25,264 --> 01:23:26,930
是怎么回事
his office has sent us.

1240
01:23:27,432 --> 01:23:29,665
我觉着你应该会想看看
But I just thought you'd be curious to see...

1241
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,433
在洛杉矶提起诉讼的这个案子
Things been issued in la county court,

1242
01:23:32,535 --> 01:23:34,468
这儿签的是你的名字
that's signed off here with your name.

1243
01:23:34,903 --> 01:23:37,603
这儿还有一封相同地址的邮件
There's another example of that with that email address.

1244
01:23:37,705 --> 01:23:38,603
嗯
Yeah.

1245
01:23:38,605 --> 01:23:39,646
那个 不是你寄的吧
To that, as opposed to you.

1246
01:23:39,647 --> 01:23:41,305
我是说 我们有一份由你发送的原件
I mean, we got the one from you originally,

1247
01:23:41,307 --> 01:23:43,006
这没什么好说的
which we... it's fine. We don't need to talk about that.

1248
01:23:43,108 --> 01:23:45,007
事情很简单 我只发过一封邮件
It's very simple. I only sent one.

1249
01:23:45,109 --> 01:23:46,174
我懂的
Yeah.

1250
01:23:46,276 --> 01:23:47,341
我懂的
Yeah.

1251
01:23:47,443 --> 01:23:48,842
-这就是你的回答了 -对的
- There's your answer. - Yeah.

1252
01:23:50,412 --> 01:23:52,178
我会看看我能做什么的
I'll see what I can do to make those stop.

1253
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:53,612
你们还在收到这种邮件吗
Have they stopped?

1254
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:55,146
啊 现在没有了
Uh, we haven't heard anything for a little while.

1255
01:23:55,248 --> 01:23:56,280
但是他们在用你的地址
They're listing your address

1256
01:23:56,382 --> 01:23:58,014
作为企业的总部地址
as their corporate headquarters, though.

1257
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:01,817
-我的吗 -对的 如果你看下这个的话
- My address? - Yeah, if you look at...

1258
01:24:01,919 --> 01:24:02,984
这是你办公室的地址
Your office.

1259
01:24:04,487 --> 01:24:05,553
简 奥布莱恩网
Janeobrienmedia.Com,

1260
01:24:05,554 --> 01:24:06,620
你的办公室地址被列为他们的企业总部地址
your address is listed as their corporate headquarters.

1261
01:24:06,989 --> 01:24:08,888
但是这不是我的网站啊
Yeah, but it's not my--

1262
01:24:08,990 --> 01:24:10,489
我知道 我知道 你看在网页最下方
No, no. On their website at the bottom.

1263
01:24:10,591 --> 01:24:12,290
但是这不是...
But it's not, um...

1264
01:24:12,659 --> 01:24:14,058
我不知道...
I don't know if it's...

1265
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:15,325
这儿写着法律顾问办公室
It says "Office of corporate counsel

1266
01:24:15,427 --> 01:24:16,692
纽约总部
and New York headquarters."

1267
01:24:16,794 --> 01:24:18,059
好吧 这是 我的地址
Well, that's my address.

1268
01:24:19,495 --> 01:24:21,111
嗯
Yeah.

1269
01:24:21,112 --> 01:24:22,728
-但是 这不是他们的法律顾问办公室啊  -这真是难以置信
- But it's not their... - It's crazy. But it's...

1270
01:24:22,897 --> 01:24:25,330
呃 我是说啊 你觉着这个奇怪吗
Um, I mean, is this weird to you?

1271
01:24:25,432 --> 01:24:26,664
这人
That this person has taken on--

1272
01:24:26,732 --> 01:24:27,997
奇怪 当然奇怪
it is. Of course, it's weird.

1273
01:24:33,503 --> 01:24:35,803
我们收到的每一封萨尔塔寄来的法律意见书
Almost every legal letter we'd received from

1274
01:24:35,905 --> 01:24:37,371
几乎全是假的
from salta was fake.

1275
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:40,273
就好像这么多跟迪马托有关的事
Like so many things connected to d'amato,

1276
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:41,907
都是假的一样
they were all just lies,

1277
01:24:42,442 --> 01:24:45,643
都是为了解释他沉迷于挠痒视频扯出来的谎
lies to support his addiction to tickling videos.

1278
01:24:49,048 --> 01:24:52,482
我的这趟旅程始于对一项奇特运动的好奇
I started this journey curious about a bizarre sport

1279
01:24:52,584 --> 01:24:54,917
这项运动叫作挠痒痒耐力比赛
called competitive endurance tickling,

1280
01:24:55,586 --> 01:24:58,753
现在我知道了 虽说叫挠痒痒但是跟挠痒痒一毛钱关系都没有
but I now think this was never even about tickling.

1281
01:25:01,724 --> 01:25:05,025
这是一场关于权利 掌控和骚扰的游戏
This is about power, control and harassment.

1282
01:25:05,527 --> 01:25:07,627
有关一个人内心的扭曲
It's about one person's twistedness

1283
01:25:07,729 --> 01:25:09,695
以及这种扭曲能够到什么程度
and how far that can go.

1284
01:25:09,797 --> 01:25:12,697
一个人试图把自己的生活搞的充满铜臭味
One person who's managed to shelter himself with money

1285
01:25:12,799 --> 01:25:15,099
只是为了继续自己内心的执念
to keep his obsession going.

1286
01:25:15,701 --> 01:25:17,867
但是现在他的生活暴露在了大家面前
But now it's his life exposed.

1287
01:25:18,202 --> 01:25:20,969
他曾经一度以真面目现身摄像机前
For once, it's him on camera.

1288
01:25:26,409 --> 01:25:27,608
在我们离开美国之前
Before we leave America,

1289
01:25:27,710 --> 01:25:30,711
我还想打最后一个电话
there's one last phone call I want to make.

1290
01:25:30,813 --> 01:25:32,879
我们在文件里发现了这个名字
It's a name we found in the documents,

1291
01:25:32,981 --> 01:25:36,548
是大卫 迪马托一家还活着的家族成员之一
one of David d'amato's last surviving family members.

1292
01:25:38,284 --> 01:25:39,349
喂
Hello?

1293
01:25:39,451 --> 01:25:42,318
–噢 您好 是多萝西吗 –是我
- Oh, hi. Is that Dorothy? - Yes.

1294
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:44,386
你好 我是大卫 法瑞尔
Oh, hi. My name's David farrier,

1295
01:25:44,488 --> 01:25:47,455
我是一名新西兰记者 您最近过得好吗
I'm a journalist from New Zealand. How are you?

1296
01:25:47,990 --> 01:25:49,456
–然后呢 –嗯 咱们继续
- Okay. - Yeah, good.

1297
01:25:49,558 --> 01:25:51,057
嘿 不好意思 对您来说这可能是
Hey, sorry, it's probably a bit of a strange call

1298
01:25:51,159 --> 01:25:52,224
意料之外的一通莫名其妙的电话
to receive out of the blue,

1299
01:25:52,459 --> 01:25:56,994
我正在做一个关于大卫 迪马托家族的系列故事
but I'm doing a story about, uh, David d'amato.

1300
01:25:59,231 --> 01:26:02,531
–噢 你准备怎么做 –呃
- Oh, in what way? - Um...

1301
01:26:03,667 --> 01:26:05,733
他有点 呃
He's been... it's the...

1302
01:26:05,901 --> 01:26:08,134
他挠痒痒的毛病好像有那么点复发
He's sort of back to the tickling stuff again.

1303
01:26:08,569 --> 01:26:09,834
噢 是吗
Oh, he is?

1304
01:26:09,936 --> 01:26:13,169
–嗯 是的 –天哪
- Yeah, he is. - Oh, god!

1305
01:26:14,338 --> 01:26:16,705
噢 我这么跟你说吧
Well, I will tell you that,

1306
01:26:16,807 --> 01:26:20,474
我跟他半毛钱关系都没有
um, I have no contact with him at all.

1307
01:26:21,844 --> 01:26:24,477
我是说 你觉得这些有个头吗
I mean, did you think all this had sort of come to an end?

1308
01:26:25,012 --> 01:26:27,078
我想过这个问题 当然会有结束的一天
I did think, of course, it came to an end,

1309
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:30,514
因为他进过局子 我也很确信您一定知道这一点
because he served time, which I'm sure you know.

1310
01:26:30,616 --> 01:26:31,681
唔
Mm.

1311
01:26:31,783 --> 01:26:34,049
但是我有点不能理解 嗯
But I don't understand, um...

1312
01:26:36,486 --> 01:26:39,419
我不能理解他为什么又开始了
I don't understand why he went back to doing this.

1313
01:26:41,089 --> 01:26:44,489
我 有点震惊 他做这个事情有多久了
I'm, like, in shock. How long has he been doing this?

1314
01:26:46,326 --> 01:26:48,025
是根本就没停过
It's never stopped.

1315
01:26:52,664 --> 01:26:55,264
我觉得他可能有人格分裂
I think he has a split personality.

1316
01:26:55,366 --> 01:26:58,766
他就站在天才与癫狂的分界线上
He's like that fine line between genius and insanity.

1317
01:27:01,637 --> 01:27:05,405
我不知道他是同性恋还是无性恋
I don't know if he's gay or he's asexual,

1318
01:27:05,507 --> 01:27:08,907
但是就我所知 他从来没有交过女朋友
but he's never had a girlfriend that I ever knew of.

1319
01:27:10,543 --> 01:27:13,043
我以前问过我丈夫
I asked my husband once, um,

1320
01:27:13,145 --> 01:27:16,246
要是发现他是基佬会不会不高兴
if he would be upset if he found out he was gay.

1321
01:27:16,348 --> 01:27:21,017
他跟我说肯定会不高兴 但是也能克服
And he said that he would be upset but he would get over it.

1322
01:27:21,119 --> 01:27:22,751
但是他是我们的独子
But he was an only child,

1323
01:27:22,853 --> 01:27:25,686
然后你也知道 我丈夫很想抱孙辈的
and, you know, he wanted grandchildren.

1324
01:27:28,357 --> 01:27:31,724
他的童年非常非常奇怪
He had a very, very strange childhood.

1325
01:27:32,693 --> 01:27:36,961
以前那些小孩老是嘲笑他
The kids used to make fun of him all the time.

1326
01:27:37,129 --> 01:27:39,596
她以前 她 说的是他的生母
And she used to... She... his mother.

1327
01:27:39,698 --> 01:27:41,864
他跟他妈妈很亲密
He was very close to his mother.

1328
01:27:42,466 --> 01:27:44,933
他妈妈也把他保护得很好
And his mother was very protective of him.

1329
01:27:45,035 --> 01:27:50,271
她从不让他骑车或者滑雪 也不许他干别的事
She never let him ride a bike or go skiing or do anything

1330
01:27:50,373 --> 01:27:52,639
因为她害怕他会受伤
because she was always afraid that he would get hurt.

1331
01:27:53,541 --> 01:27:54,873
而且就我所知
And from what I understand,

1332
01:27:54,975 --> 01:27:56,708
孩子们以前很喜欢跑到他们家房子周围
the kids used to come around the house,

1333
01:27:56,810 --> 01:27:58,309
也常常取笑他
and they used to make fun of him.

1334
01:27:58,411 --> 01:28:01,945
有一次这些孩子把他锁在了学校的储物柜里
And once they locked him in a locker in school.

1335
01:28:05,884 --> 01:28:07,483
然后 你也知道 他是老师啊
And, you know, he was a teacher...

1336
01:28:08,819 --> 01:28:10,652
这帮孩子就把他丢出了学校
And they threw him out of school.

1337
01:28:11,187 --> 01:28:13,287
你明白吗 我以前有点怕他
You know, I was afraid of him,

1338
01:28:13,822 --> 01:28:18,724
因为我是自己一个人 怎么说呢 我就是有点怕
because I'm alone and, um... Yeah, I was afraid of him.

1339
01:28:18,826 --> 01:28:22,093
嗯 如你所见 我挺怕他的
So, you know, I'm afraid of him.
