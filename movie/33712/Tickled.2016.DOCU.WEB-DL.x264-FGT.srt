 you're trying to achieve here?</i>

9
00:00:55,617 --> 00:00:57,984

00:09:51,022 --> 00:09:53,622
David: Oh, that's okay. It's the
New Zealand hospitality.

153
00:09:55,092 --> 00:09:56,624
- David: You can get me there.
- Kevin:

154
00:09:57,927 --> 00:10:00,793
David: Yeah, we're just rolling
from the beginning. Yeah, yeah.

155
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:04,028
Okay. We've got a thing
in New Zealand,

156
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,430
we're okay to film
in public spaces.

157
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:09,265
So I'm just following
the journey.

158
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:16,704
Okay, all right. Well, we're--

159
00:10:16,872 --> 00:10:19,038
Adam:

160
00:10:19,206 --> 00:10:20,271
It's not--

161
00:10:20,273 --> 00:10:22,506
David: Okay. Well, I mean,
we're shooting a documentary,

162
00:10:22,608 --> 00:10:25,108
so we'll keep... it's a--

163
00:10:25,877 --> 00:10:26,976
David: Mm.

164
00:10:30,247 --> 00:10:31,312
David: Okay.

165
00:10:31,314 --> 00:10:34,648
Okay. We're okay to film in
public spaces in New Zealand,

166
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,983
so we're doing that here.

167
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,385
David:
All right, we'll see you soon.

168
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,853
- Marko:
- David: Okay, sounds good.

169
00:10:41,956 --> 00:10:43,121
All right, see you soon.

170
00:10:44,657 --> 00:10:46,189
David:
No worries. We'll talk soon.

171
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,335
Marko:

172
00:11:01,337 --> 00:11:04,471
<i>David: Hey, Marko.
It's Dave farrier. How are you?</i>

173
00:11:06,475 --> 00:11:08,808
<i> Yeah, good. How are you
 settling into Auckland?</i>

174
00:11:22,356 --> 00:11:24,222
Okay. No, that sounds
good to me, I think.

175
00:11:24,324 --> 00:11:27,992
Just, Dylan and I both talked,
and we just weren't confident,

176
00:11:28,094 --> 00:11:29,393
or didn't think it was
a good idea

177
00:11:29,628 --> 00:11:32,194
just to go straight to a room.
Maybe it's a cultural thing.

178
00:11:33,964 --> 00:11:35,730
<i> But a conference room</i>

179
00:11:35,832 --> 00:11:37,498
<i>- um, of your choosing,
 - Marko: Okay.</i>

180
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,667
<i> Whether it's at the Hilton or
 elsewhere, is absolutely fine.</i>

181
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:46,706
Marko:

182
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,886
<i>Marko: And, um...</i>

183
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:21,705
David:

184
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,140
Marko:

185
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:41,489
Dylan:

186
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:45,959
Marko:

187
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,236
Dylan:

188
00:12:57,371 --> 00:12:58,570
Kevin:

189
00:12:58,672 --> 00:13:00,738
Dylan:

190
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:02,805
Kevin:

191
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,440
Dylan:

192
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:10,310
Kevin:

193
00:13:12,447 --> 00:13:13,312
David: Sure.

194
00:13:13,414 --> 00:13:16,281
Dylan:

195
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:20,785
David:

196
00:13:30,363 --> 00:13:32,262
Kevin:

197
00:13:57,819 --> 00:13:59,685
<i>David: Kevin didn't take
 to Dylan very well</i>

198
00:13:59,787 --> 00:14:01,787
<i> and wants to meet me alone.</i>

199
00:14:03,056 --> 00:14:05,823
<i> I quickly make this
 covert piece of technology.</i>

200
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:08,491
<i> A camera in a coffee cup.</i>

201
00:14:12,563 --> 00:14:14,629
Kevin: What's the end game here?
What do you get at the end

202
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:16,130
or even if you get everything
you want?

203
00:14:16,232 --> 00:14:19,366
- David: Mm. Mm.
- And what are we risking here?

204
00:14:20,302 --> 00:14:24,203
You know, do we really want
someone coming after you

205
00:14:24,305 --> 00:14:25,804
with all that money?

206
00:14:26,406 --> 00:14:27,905
I've known a lot of
rich people in my life.

207
00:14:28,007 --> 00:14:29,072
I've worked for a lot of them.

208
00:14:29,174 --> 00:14:31,541
They don't work by the
same set of rules.

209
00:14:31,643 --> 00:14:33,709
They don't dangle them out
of buildings any more,

210
00:14:33,811 --> 00:14:35,644
but they don't have to.

211
00:14:35,746 --> 00:14:38,546
And that's the thing.
They start suing,

212
00:14:38,948 --> 00:14:41,882
and you're done halfway through
or a quarter of the way through

213
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:44,250
because it costs so much
to defend yourself.

214
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:46,051
David: So unless...
Essentially, I mean,

215
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:49,020
unless we stop the doco,
we're gonna be fucked.

216
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,755
Really. It seems that's
what it comes down to.

217
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,023
Kevin: I'm not gonna use those
words directly,

218
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,425
because that wouldn't
be prudent.

219
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:58,528
But... let me rephrase.
Unless you stopped...

220
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,364
Unless we can figure out a way
to ameliorate that situation,

221
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:03,299
we all are.

222
00:15:09,573 --> 00:15:12,807
<i>David: Facing lawsuits and
 a company with deep pockets,</i>

223
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:15,342
<i> I wondered if we should
 just walk away.</i>

224
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,346
<i> But Dylan was part of this now</i>

225
00:15:20,448 --> 00:15:23,348
<i> and didn't want to give in to
 a bunch of bullies.</i>

226
00:15:24,451 --> 00:15:26,851
<i>Kevin:
 Dylan wants to pursue this
 on his own?</i>

227
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:30,654
<i>David: Uh, I gather from
 what he's saying, yeah.</i>

228
00:15:30,956 --> 00:15:33,723
<i>Kevin: Okay.
 Um, if Dylan wants to do that,</i>

229
00:15:33,825 --> 00:15:36,158
<i> Dylan does...
 Dylan will do that.</i>

230
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,694
<i> If you don't want to do that,
 then just walk away from it.</i>

231
00:15:40,296 --> 00:15:41,695
<i>David: Yeah.</i>

232
00:15:41,997 --> 00:15:45,330
<i>Kevin: And I will... Dylan
will be dealt with accordingly.</i>

233
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:48,299
How was school?

234
00:15:48,401 --> 00:15:51,468
<i>Marko:  The main
 thing, David, you know, that I
 wanted to tell you is that</i>

235
00:15:51,603 --> 00:15:53,002
<i> I think that you're brilliant.</i>

236
00:15:53,104 --> 00:15:55,003
<i> And that you have
 a great career.</i>

237
00:15:55,105 --> 00:15:57,538
<i> So I was really,
 really happy to find out</i>

238
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,741
<i> that you wanted just to
 distance yourself from it.</i>

239
00:16:00,843 --> 00:16:05,512
<i> And I don't understand why
 Dylan would not want to.</i>

240
00:16:07,282 --> 00:16:08,748
<i> What I'm worried about too,
 I know Kevin says,</i>

241
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,316
<i> "well, if he wants to
 go ahead with it,</i>

242
00:16:11,752 --> 00:16:12,484
<i> let him go ahead with it."</i>

243
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:13,217
<i>But he'll become a real target,
 and believe me,</i>

244
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,886
<i>it will be really ugly for him.</i>

245
00:16:14,988 --> 00:16:16,554
<i> And I would...
 I would hate to see that too,</i>

246
00:16:16,689 --> 00:16:17,921
<i> because I know he has a family</i>

247
00:16:17,923 --> 00:16:22,425
<i> and, you know, he's probably,
 uh, a good bloke down deep.</i>

248
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:36,102
<i>David: I've never heard threats
 like this in my life,</i>

249
00:16:36,437 --> 00:16:38,937
<i> and all of this
 over some tickling!</i>

250
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,706
<i> Kevin and Marko fly
 back to America.</i>

251
00:16:43,608 --> 00:16:46,842
<i> And a few days later,
 Dylan and I follow.</i>

252
00:16:47,878 --> 00:16:50,445
<i> Something about bullies
 with way too much money</i>

253
00:16:50,547 --> 00:16:52,513
<i> has convinced me
 I shouldn't drop it.</i>

254
00:16:53,048 --> 00:16:56,782
<i> Plus, we think there's a
 competitive tickling shoot
 happening this week.</i>

255
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:02,186
<i> We've reached out to nearly
 a hundred boys in the videos,</i>

256
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:04,787
<i> but they all seem too
 nervous to talk.</i>

257
00:17:10,293 --> 00:17:13,193
<i> Finally tj agrees to meet us.</i>

258
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:19,698
<i> We met Kevin Clarke
 downtown la somewhere.</i>

259
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,867
<i> I can't remember exactly where
it was at, but it was a studio.</i>

260
00:17:24,537 --> 00:17:26,203
<i> He seemed pretty
 normal at the time.</i>

261
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:29,772
My first impression of him,
you know, he was just, like,

262
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,040
kind of...
Kind of a little weird.

263
00:17:34,477 --> 00:17:35,776
<i> You know,
 I was young at the time,</i>

264
00:17:35,878 --> 00:17:36,977
<i> didn't think nothing of it,</i>

265
00:17:36,979 --> 00:17:39,112
<i> and I was like, "cool."
 You know, $2000 or whatever,</i>

266
00:17:39,214 --> 00:17:40,546
<i> "yeah. It's gonna be cool."</i>

267
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:46,450
It was actually a hard
time for my family.

268
00:17:46,452 --> 00:17:50,387
A family member of mine was
going through cancer, and money
was tight at the household.

269
00:17:50,489 --> 00:17:53,890
So I was a little bit desperate
at the time as well for money,
working on the side,

270
00:17:53,992 --> 00:17:55,891
and doing what I can. So when
i heard this dollar sign,

271
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:57,926
I was like, "yeah," you know,
"I'll definitely do that."

272
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,562
<i> And then I went inside</i>

273
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,964
<i> and noticed that it was
 all guys in there.</i>

274
00:18:05,534 --> 00:18:08,601
<i> And that's when I was like,
 "oh, dang!" Like...</i>

275
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,805
<i> And I didn't know I was
 gonna get tied down.</i>

276
00:18:14,407 --> 00:18:16,740
<i>I had no idea what it'd be for.</i>

277
00:18:16,842 --> 00:18:18,842
<i> Honestly, I was like,
 "okay, what?"</i>

278
00:18:20,445 --> 00:18:23,345
At that point I was like,
"all right, you know what?
It's already going down.

279
00:18:23,447 --> 00:18:24,813
I don't really know
what it's for,

280
00:18:24,915 --> 00:18:26,280
but hopefully
it never gets out."

281
00:18:46,932 --> 00:18:48,464
No, no, no. Not any fuckin'...

282
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:52,300
Ah! Fuck! That actually
tickles, dude.

283
00:18:55,271 --> 00:18:59,139
Ah! Fuck!

284
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:02,308
Being violated on so many
different levels right now.

285
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:05,377
<i> There was other athletes.
 There was mma guys.</i>

286
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:06,811
<i> There was a bodybuilder,</i>

287
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:09,980
<i> and then there was a couple
 of actors, normal actors.</i>

288
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,548
<i> I've seen some of them on
 commercials,</i>

289
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,816
<i> TV commercials. Normal guys.</i>

290
00:19:13,918 --> 00:19:16,350
<i>Like, completely normal people.</i>

291
00:19:18,253 --> 00:19:20,620
Get the fuck off my feet!

292
00:19:20,722 --> 00:19:22,188
<i> It was a torture project.</i>

293
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,690
That's what I believe
Kevin Clarke told me.

294
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:28,793
There was something to do with
even a military tactic,
or something like that.

295
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,561
He was gonna do...

296
00:19:30,763 --> 00:19:33,130
I think he said
Jane was doing a project

297
00:19:33,232 --> 00:19:36,166
on using tickling
as a military tactic.

298
00:19:36,268 --> 00:19:37,367
And at that point, I...

299
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:39,368
I knew it was complete bullshit,
you know?

300
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,470
I was like, "okay, the military
is gonna use tickling

301
00:19:41,572 --> 00:19:43,705
as a torture tactic?"

302
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,073
Fuck!

303
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:52,344
<i>David: When did the video
 come back to get you?</i>

304
00:19:53,647 --> 00:19:56,581
About a year, maybe
a little more, ago.

305
00:20:05,924 --> 00:20:07,490
<i> I would Google myself
 once in a while,</i>

306
00:20:07,592 --> 00:20:08,691
<i> to read old articles</i>

307
00:20:08,693 --> 00:20:10,859
<i> or see what teams might have
 listed me in an article</i>

308
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:12,026
<i> or try-outs.</i>

309
00:20:16,865 --> 00:20:20,333
<i> And to my surprise,
 a video was on YouTube.</i>

310
00:20:20,435 --> 00:20:24,503
Hello. I'm tj, and I'm here
on a tickling competition.

311
00:20:24,605 --> 00:20:27,072
And, uh, first question is:
"Are you ticklish?"

312
00:20:27,174 --> 00:20:29,274
Well, obviously I'm ticklish if
I'm here, so,

313
00:20:29,376 --> 00:20:30,775
that's kind of
a silly question. But, uh...

314
00:20:30,877 --> 00:20:33,277
<i> It was just me
 sitting in front of the camera</i>

315
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:36,079
<i> talking about the,
 uh, tickling process.</i>

316
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:38,548
Just weird things. And so I was
like, "okay, it's not that bad."

317
00:20:39,617 --> 00:20:41,550
"When you are asked,
'are you ticklish?'

318
00:20:41,652 --> 00:20:43,952
how do you normally
respond and why?"

319
00:20:44,321 --> 00:20:47,889
Normally, I say,
"no, I'm not ticklish."

320
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:53,193
<i> So I emailed Jane and asked
 her to take the video down.</i>

321
00:20:57,032 --> 00:20:59,365
She didn't ever reply.

322
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,800
So I took the matters
into my own hands,

323
00:21:01,968 --> 00:21:03,867
and I, uh, told YouTube that

324
00:21:03,969 --> 00:21:06,069
uh, they're illegally
using my name.

325
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:13,309
So YouTube took the video down.
That's when it all started.

326
00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:19,313
<i>Woman: "Now, I am laughing."</i>

327
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:22,916
<i> "I don't think you've grasped
 the magnitude</i>

328
00:21:23,018 --> 00:21:24,584
<i> of what you have provoked."</i>

329
00:21:25,086 --> 00:21:27,653
<i> "I'm interested to see how you
 handle the fallout.</i>

330
00:21:27,755 --> 00:21:32,323
<i> So far, badly."
 "Regards, Debbie j. Kuhn."</i>

331
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:35,292
<i> That's when this Deborah
 person popped into my life.</i>

332
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:38,529
I mean,
just all hell broke loose.

333
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:45,869
<i> Every kind of video search you
 can find, it was up there.</i>

334
00:21:47,672 --> 00:21:49,505
<i> And then it
 pops up in my emails,</i>

335
00:21:49,607 --> 00:21:51,540
<i> and then it pops up
 more on YouTube,</i>

336
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:53,508
<i> and it just starts
 appearing everywhere.</i>

337
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,942
<i> This video...
 Just, all of them.</i>

338
00:21:55,044 --> 00:21:56,443
<i> All of them start blowing up.</i>

339
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:07,385
And there was threats.
It said, "watch out!

340
00:22:07,487 --> 00:22:08,619
Your family better watch out

341
00:22:08,821 --> 00:22:10,687
because we're gonna put your
last name to shame.

342
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:13,256
Any time you search your last
name, it's gonna pop up."

343
00:22:13,358 --> 00:22:15,091
Like, direct threats.

344
00:22:18,162 --> 00:22:19,461
<i>They ended up making a website,</i>

345
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:20,961
<i> putting my
 personal information:</i>

346
00:22:21,063 --> 00:22:22,862
<i> My name, my address,</i>

347
00:22:22,997 --> 00:22:25,730
<i> my personal phone number,
 my email address,</i>

348
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:28,699
all with just dumb lies.

349
00:22:31,737 --> 00:22:34,771
<i> Then Debbie kuhn starts going
 off on me left and right,</i>

350
00:22:34,873 --> 00:22:37,273
<i> sending emails to the
 high school that I coach at.</i>

351
00:22:37,808 --> 00:22:40,809
<i>Woman: "I have additional
information as a past employer.</i>

352
00:22:40,911 --> 00:22:42,744
<i> You don't want this
 guy in your league.</i>

353
00:22:42,846 --> 00:22:45,580
<i>Can you afford the distraction,
 the press,</i>

354
00:22:45,682 --> 00:22:49,050
<i> with an outed gay guy
 having a male tickling fetish,</i>

355
00:22:49,152 --> 00:22:51,152
<i> in which he likes to tickle
 and be tickled</i>

356
00:22:51,254 --> 00:22:54,321
<i> by tied-up other gay
 athletes and bodybuilders?"</i>

357
00:22:54,423 --> 00:22:56,222
<i> False accusations,
 saying I'm a drug addict</i>

358
00:22:56,324 --> 00:22:58,891
and I was a child molester
and I'm gay, and this and that,

359
00:22:58,993 --> 00:23:01,093
which none of those things
have ever been true.

360
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,276
<i> I've always been very proud.</i>

361
00:23:19,378 --> 00:23:21,111
<i> The way I walk around,
 I'm proud of who I am.</i>

362
00:23:21,213 --> 00:23:22,512
<i> You know what I mean?
 So to speak.</i>

363
00:23:22,614 --> 00:23:24,013
<i> I'm confident in myself
 as an athlete,</i>

364
00:23:24,115 --> 00:23:25,481
<i> as a person, as a player.</i>

365
00:23:26,784 --> 00:23:28,083
<i> But when I'd go to try-outs,</i>

366
00:23:28,185 --> 00:23:30,118
<i> the first thing
 I would think about is,</i>

367
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,520
<i> "well, I wonder
 if these coaches
 have looked up that video?"</i>

368
00:23:34,624 --> 00:23:36,123
<i> And it's happened.
 It has happened.</i>

369
00:23:36,225 --> 00:23:37,924
<i> I've been released
 from football teams.</i>

370
00:23:38,026 --> 00:23:39,358
<i> They've told me, uh,</i>

371
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,160
that I'm the best player
on that team at that position,

372
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:45,095
but because it is
a distraction for the media,

373
00:23:45,197 --> 00:23:46,196
they don't need that attention

374
00:23:46,198 --> 00:23:48,865
and they'll go with somebody
else 'cause they don't feel
like explaining it.

375
00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:53,302
<i> You know, and I've actually
dealt with a lot of things
 because of it.</i>

376
00:23:54,805 --> 00:23:57,806
It's cost me money, it's cost me
jobs, it's caused me harassment,

377
00:23:57,908 --> 00:24:01,042
which is exactly what Debbie
kuhn and Jane o'brien wanted.

378
00:24:01,144 --> 00:24:03,944
So, I mean, more or less in
that aspect, they've won.

379
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,654
<i>David: It's obvious we're not
 the only ones being harassed</i>

380
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:18,455
<i> by Jane o'brien media.</i>

381
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:22,058
<i> And there are so many websites
 made up like tj's</i>

382
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,859
<i> which seem to exist purely</i>

383
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:25,994
<i> to shame the guys
 who've been tickled.</i>

384
00:24:29,232 --> 00:24:32,665
<i> What goes on at these shoots,
 and why is she so aggressive?</i>

385
00:24:34,902 --> 00:24:36,468
<i> Dylan's been doing
 some research,</i>

386
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,337
<i> and he thinks he knows where
 the next shoot is happening.</i>

387
00:24:41,474 --> 00:24:43,841
<i> We stake out the studio,
 hoping to find out</i>

388
00:24:43,943 --> 00:24:47,010
<i> how a competitive
 tickling shoot goes down.</i>

389
00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:49,211
Dominic: Okay, car.

390
00:24:56,018 --> 00:24:57,851
And another car. Two cars.

391
00:24:58,186 --> 00:24:59,652
David: Two cars.

392
00:25:05,526 --> 00:25:06,892
Dominic: Can you see
what the car's doing?

393
00:25:06,994 --> 00:25:08,193
I've lost him.

394
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,899
- Dominic: Who's that guy?
- David: Oh, that's Marko.

395
00:25:17,637 --> 00:25:20,938
Dylan: Oh, yeah. And we've got
four guys going in so far.

396
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,406
Dominic: Four guys.

397
00:25:27,012 --> 00:25:28,544
Dylan: That's the guy
from New Zealand.

398
00:25:28,646 --> 00:25:30,245
David: Yep, there's Kevin.

399
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:54,867
<i>David: We could hear laughter
 coming out of the vents.</i>

400
00:25:58,971 --> 00:26:01,137
<i> It went on for hours,</i>

401
00:26:02,874 --> 00:26:05,441
<i> the boys occasionally
 taking breaks.</i>

402
00:26:17,821 --> 00:26:19,821
You know, this is actually
fucking creepy as fuck.

403
00:26:19,923 --> 00:26:21,889
Dylan: Like, this feels
to me like a pep talk.

404
00:26:22,024 --> 00:26:23,089
Dominic: Yeah.

405
00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:26,158
<i>David: As the day wraps up,</i>

406
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,493
<i> I want to give Kevin
 one last chance</i>

407
00:26:28,595 --> 00:26:30,561
<i> to talk about what's going on.</i>

408
00:26:32,164 --> 00:26:33,496
<i> With pending lawsuits,</i>

409
00:26:33,598 --> 00:26:36,999
<i> I'm cautious and don't want to
 storm into the studio.</i>

410
00:26:39,203 --> 00:26:40,335
David:
They haven't locked the door.

411
00:26:40,437 --> 00:26:42,002
Dylan: I think we go.

412
00:26:44,773 --> 00:26:46,305
All right. Okay, let's go.

413
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:49,107
- David: We're good?
- Dominic: Yep, we're good.

414
00:26:59,586 --> 00:27:00,751
Dominic: Come this way.

415
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,954
David: Here we go.
We've been spotted.

416
00:27:14,765 --> 00:27:18,500
Hello, Marko. Hey, guys.

417
00:27:27,544 --> 00:27:28,809
Adam, how's it going?

418
00:27:28,911 --> 00:27:30,543
Adam:

419
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,846
Hello, sir.

420
00:27:34,048 --> 00:27:35,614
Kevin:

421
00:27:36,116 --> 00:27:37,348
We're not welcome here?

422
00:27:40,886 --> 00:27:42,552
All right.
Well, we'll head off.

423
00:27:43,555 --> 00:27:45,054
You don't want to do
any final chats or anything?

424
00:27:45,156 --> 00:27:46,355
Last opportunity.

425
00:27:51,495 --> 00:27:52,827
That's all we can do.

426
00:28:00,469 --> 00:28:02,502
<i> Turn right
 on bellevue Avenue,</i>

427
00:28:02,604 --> 00:28:04,370
<i> then take the first right.</i>

428
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,708
I think... yeah, uh,
after New Zealand and that,

429
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,977
I think it's
safe to say that we don't...

430
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:15,512
We don't have an interview
with Kevin or Marko.

431
00:28:16,181 --> 00:28:17,480
<i> And we certainly
 weren't getting</i>

432
00:28:17,582 --> 00:28:20,482
<i> any more of the competitors
 to talk on camera.</i>

433
00:28:20,584 --> 00:28:22,417
<i> They were all too terrified,</i>

434
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:26,420
<i> hoping if they stayed quiet,
 the harassment would go away.</i>

435
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,023
Dylan: I mean, are we making the
whole thing worse for everyone

436
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,724
just by even being here?

437
00:28:32,826 --> 00:28:34,559
David: Yeah.
I think it's possible.

438
00:28:34,661 --> 00:28:37,728
I worry that we make it
worse for some people who...

439
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,696
Who've gotten through the
worst of it, you know?

440
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:40,863
Dylan: Mm.

441
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,180
<i>David: Jane o'brien clearly
 isn't being honest</i>

442
00:29:00,282 --> 00:29:01,848
<i> about what the videos are for.</i>

443
00:29:02,217 --> 00:29:04,617
<i> And I'm convinced that despite
 the Adidas gear,</i>

444
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:07,186
<i> it's not a real sport.</i>

445
00:29:11,892 --> 00:29:13,691
<i> I've tracked down
 a man in Florida</i>

446
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,893
<i>who also makes tickling videos,</i>

447
00:29:15,995 --> 00:29:19,596
<i> but, unlike Jane, is more
 than happy to talk about it.</i>

448
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,393
<i>Richard: People ask me about
what is the appeal of tickling?</i>

449
00:29:53,863 --> 00:29:56,563
<i> It's kind of like the whips
 and chains, you know,</i>

450
00:29:56,665 --> 00:29:59,265
<i> bondage sort of thing, where
 somebody's getting flogged.</i>

451
00:29:59,367 --> 00:30:02,801
<i> But it's just really brought
 down a level, you know?</i>

452
00:30:02,903 --> 00:30:04,602
<i> It's like kind of a sadistic</i>

453
00:30:04,704 --> 00:30:07,071
<i> exerting your will
 on someone else,</i>

454
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:09,273
<i> and having them do something
 out of their control</i>

455
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:12,008
<i> like laughing without
 being able to get away,</i>

456
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:15,344
<i> as if it's, uh,
 tickle torture to them.</i>

457
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:18,280
David: And a lot of people
don't seem to know

458
00:30:18,382 --> 00:30:20,115
about the tickling fetish.

459
00:30:20,217 --> 00:30:21,916
Do you think it's a little bit
more unknown?

460
00:30:22,018 --> 00:30:24,051
Oh, totally.
Yeah, completely.

461
00:30:24,153 --> 00:30:26,720
'Cause most people, you know,
know about a foot fetish,

462
00:30:27,556 --> 00:30:29,188
um, but tickling?

463
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:31,556
Most people are like,
"oh, wow. Is that a thing?"

464
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,763
<i> It was in 1999. I had just
 gotten out of grad school,</i>

465
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:43,232
<i> you know, so I just got
 a video camera,</i>

466
00:30:43,334 --> 00:30:44,933
<i> put together a little
 business plan,</i>

467
00:30:46,069 --> 00:30:47,134
<i> talked to one of my friends</i>

468
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,269
<i> and he financed me,
 when I started the site,</i>

469
00:30:49,371 --> 00:30:51,770
<i> I think for $6000 or $7000.</i>

470
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,740
<i> It got pretty much an
 immediate response.</i>

471
00:31:09,187 --> 00:31:10,386
<i> I was making enough
 after a year</i>

472
00:31:10,488 --> 00:31:12,421
<i> to quit my job
 and do it full-time.</i>

473
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:17,391
<i>David: So this is it?</i>

474
00:31:17,693 --> 00:31:19,225
- This is it.
- This is the studio.

475
00:31:19,327 --> 00:31:21,293
- Mm-hm.
- The chair.

476
00:31:22,529 --> 00:31:25,329
And then the changing room,
bathroom.

477
00:31:25,531 --> 00:31:28,164
And so, this whole place
is purely for the tickling?

478
00:31:28,266 --> 00:31:29,431
Yes.

479
00:31:33,403 --> 00:31:35,403
<i>David: Oh, so you've got a few
 different spaces, right?</i>

480
00:31:35,505 --> 00:31:36,604
<i>Richard: Yeah, yeah.</i>

481
00:31:36,706 --> 00:31:38,338
<i> I used to do all this
 out of my house.</i>

482
00:31:38,506 --> 00:31:39,404
<i>David: Yeah.</i>

483
00:31:39,406 --> 00:31:41,973
And then it was, you know,
a parade of people coming in,

484
00:31:42,075 --> 00:31:44,842
do all this, have to clean up.

485
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,811
You know, have to clean
it up before a shoot.

486
00:31:47,913 --> 00:31:50,480
And this way I can walk away.

487
00:31:50,582 --> 00:31:51,647
Yeah, this is great.

488
00:31:51,749 --> 00:31:52,814
Like, "I'm tired. Going home."

489
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:53,981
<i>David: You're done.</i>

490
00:31:53,983 --> 00:31:55,916
<i> Well, this is work, right?
 It's like work, home.</i>

491
00:31:56,018 --> 00:31:57,450
<i>Richard: Mm-hm. Exactly.</i>

492
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:00,619
Have you done stuff like this
before for anyone else?

493
00:32:00,721 --> 00:32:02,420
Or this sort of a unique
thing for you?

494
00:32:02,522 --> 00:32:03,921
Uh, unique thing.

495
00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:06,490
I never worked for
a tickling site before.

496
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:07,624
- Okay.
- Man: No.

497
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:09,626
<i>David: And what did you first
 think when you got the pitch?</i>

498
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:11,527
<i>Man: I mean, I laughed about it.</i>

499
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,428
<i> I'm like,
 this can't be really serious,</i>

500
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,162
<i> like, people really can't...</i>

501
00:32:15,264 --> 00:32:17,998
<i> Enjoy watching this
 or getting it done.</i>

502
00:32:18,633 --> 00:32:19,798
But, um, I said, "why not?"

503
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,366
You know, I'm more of like
the risk-taker.

504
00:32:21,468 --> 00:32:24,202
I'd rather say I did something
than didn't do something.

505
00:32:24,304 --> 00:32:25,369
So I came down,

506
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:28,655
really was kind of nervous,
didn't know what to expect.

507
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:29,772
And then...
But Richard put me at ease,

508
00:32:29,874 --> 00:32:31,807
and once you're trapped
in you're there.

509
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:34,676
So, I mean, you might
as well enjoy it.

510
00:32:34,878 --> 00:32:36,110
All right.

511
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,314
- Richard: Okay, ready?
- I think you're...

512
00:32:42,784 --> 00:32:43,849
Man:
Take it easy on me today.

513
00:32:43,984 --> 00:32:45,183
Richard: Yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

514
00:32:45,285 --> 00:32:46,350
Man: That's good.

515
00:32:51,589 --> 00:32:53,455
- Got to enjoy my freedom now.
- Richard: Yeah.

516
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:55,956
- Because I cannot.
- Richard: Wave goodbye.

517
00:32:56,091 --> 00:32:57,690
I am not getting out.

518
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,324
Oh, shit.

519
00:33:02,761 --> 00:33:05,695
The world of tickling.

520
00:33:10,566 --> 00:33:12,132
So, catch your breath.

521
00:33:14,469 --> 00:33:16,635
- Breath caught.
- Okay.

522
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:28,311
All right.

523
00:33:28,413 --> 00:33:30,079
Now tell everybody
what a tough guy you are.

524
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:39,020
Just go.

525
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,066
Stop.

526
00:34:02,308 --> 00:34:03,874
Oh, my gosh.

527
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:06,208
I hate this.

528
00:34:50,352 --> 00:34:51,951
<i>David: So when did you realize</i>

529
00:34:52,053 --> 00:34:57,122
<i> that you found tickling
 to be an erotic thing?</i>

530
00:34:57,991 --> 00:34:59,457
<i>Richard: I was very young,</i>

531
00:34:59,592 --> 00:35:04,294
you know, probably five or six.
You know, very, very young.

532
00:35:08,766 --> 00:35:13,734
<i> You see something in a cartoon
 or a magazine that, you know,</i>

533
00:35:13,836 --> 00:35:15,902
<i> kind of interests
 you as a little kid,</i>

534
00:35:16,004 --> 00:35:17,770
<i> and for me it would be,
 you know, like,</i>

535
00:35:17,872 --> 00:35:20,772
<i> cartoon characters being
 tickled or tied up or,</i>

536
00:35:20,874 --> 00:35:22,173
<i> you know, that sort of thing.</i>

537
00:35:22,275 --> 00:35:24,942
<i> And it would, you know,
 fascinate me,</i>

538
00:35:25,044 --> 00:35:27,344
<i> but I had no idea why.</i>

539
00:35:50,468 --> 00:35:53,135
Richard: How do you feel?

540
00:35:53,637 --> 00:35:55,169
I feel tired.

541
00:35:55,271 --> 00:35:57,537
- I feel sweaty.
- Can I get you some water?

542
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:02,841
Yeah, water would probably work.

543
00:36:04,077 --> 00:36:06,444
<i>Richard: I started to become
 comfortable with this, uh,</i>

<i>fetish and this part of myself,</i>

545
00:36:08,546 --> 00:36:11,446
<i> and started to really realize

548
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,483
and then did a search
for what I was looking for

549
00:36:17,585 --> 00:36:18,483
and found that, "wow!

<i> At the time,
 the late '90s,</i>

553
00:36:31,762 --> 00:36:35,063

<i> And she said her name was
 Terri, Terri tickle.</i>

<i> And Terri disisto, she put

<i> She always had a picture
 of herself.</i>

557
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,442
<i> You know, a blonde,
 pretty, college-aged girl.</i>

558
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:56,645
<i> And, she always posted
 the same verbiage.</i>

559
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:58,313
<i> Something like,
 "this is not porn.</i>

560

<i> My interest is in tickling."</i>

561
00:37:01,251 --> 00:37:05,486
<i> And she just said that she was
 a tickling fanatic and...</i>

562
00:37:06,055 --> 00:37:08,422
But, I mean, these posts
were everywhere.

563
00:37:11,526 --> 00:37:13,792
<i> And then, um, some videos
 started popping up,</i>

<i> you know, very,
 you know, innocent.</i>

I guess you could say.

574
00:37:51,988 --> 00:37:55,722
Someone who, uh,
got her rocks off by, uh,

575
00:37:55,824 --> 00:37:58,558
seeing guys, uh,
tied and tickled.

576
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:01,459

Tickle torture videos.

and do not release them
at any time

604
00:39:40,067 --> 00:39:41,466
during the entire tickle test.

605
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,034
Do your worst on this one.

606
00:39:43,503 --> 00:39:44,768
<i>Dave: We would put them
 in through</i>

607
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:46,870
<i> their stage one audition,</i>

608
00:39:46,972 --> 00:39:50,439
<i> which is the questions
 and the test tickles.</i>

609
00:39:51,475 --> 00:39:54,309
Man 1: Do not collapse.
Stay looking up at us.

610
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:01,614
Stay facing us.

611
00:40:08,721 --> 00:40:15,625
<i>Dave: Stage two is tying them to
 the table, tickling them,</i>

612
00:40:15,727 --> 00:40:17,727
flipping them over
every 15 minutes,

613
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:21,230
kind of like a sausage or meat.

614
00:40:25,001 --> 00:40:26,467
<i>Dave: And then after that, uh,</i>

615
00:40:26,569 --> 00:40:30,303
we had the competitive tickling
at that point.

616
00:40:30,405 --> 00:40:33,572
Tickle wars and stuff like that.

617
00:40:33,674 --> 00:40:37,842
And that would involve
a massive production.

618
00:40:52,123 --> 00:40:53,622
<i>Woman: Okay, don't laugh.</i>

619
00:40:54,091 --> 00:40:56,157
<i> You're giggling already,
 aren't you?</i>

620
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,260
<i> Well, you just might be
 the type of person</i>

621
00:41:00,362 --> 00:41:02,328
<i> that David starr
 is looking for.</i>

622
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:03,695
<i> He is a Hollywood producer</i>

623
00:41:03,797 --> 00:41:06,297
<i> working on a new
 reality-based game show</i>

624
00:41:06,399 --> 00:41:08,699
<i> called tickle talk.</i>

625
00:41:09,068 --> 00:41:13,270
Dave:

626
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:20,609
<i>Woman: It might be
 preferable to</i>

627
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:22,844
<i> eating rats or grubs
 on survivor</i>

628
00:41:22,946 --> 00:41:24,679
<i> but just barely.</i>

629
00:41:24,781 --> 00:41:28,048
<i> I'm Anne James,
ksen k96 news.</i>

630
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:31,017
<i>David: Dave starr had steady
 work for five years,</i>

631
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,352
<i> even when Terri was
 hospitalized for six months.</i>

632
00:41:34,954 --> 00:41:36,219
<i> During that time,</i>

633
00:41:36,321 --> 00:41:37,953
<i> she just wrote
 letters specifying</i>

634
00:41:38,055 --> 00:41:40,955
<i> exactly what she wanted
 in the tickling videos.</i>

635
00:41:41,057 --> 00:41:43,223
<i>Terri:
 "David, merry Christmas!</i>

636
00:41:43,325 --> 00:41:45,558
<i> So sorry,
I'm in the hospital with mono."</i>

637
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,527
<i> "David, just a few things
 I need you to do..."</i>

638
00:41:48,629 --> 00:41:51,196
<i> "Tell them I will send the
 computer as soon as I'm well."</i>

639
00:41:51,298 --> 00:41:53,564
<i> "His name is Josh." "I hope
 to be online again in feb."</i>

640
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:56,833
<i> "I'm still sick in bed."
 "That's all for now. Td."</i>

641
00:42:00,171 --> 00:42:02,571
My most ticklish place is,
i guess...

642
00:42:03,574 --> 00:42:07,976
Definitely, like...
It'd have to be in my legs...

643
00:42:08,778 --> 00:42:12,079
More than, like, my armpits
or my feet, I think, but...

644
00:42:12,347 --> 00:42:14,914
<i>Dave: At that time
 she wanted to put up</i>

645
00:42:15,016 --> 00:42:18,350
and did indeed put up
a website for a while, uh,

646
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:22,219
unauthorized releasing
of the videos...

647
00:42:23,422 --> 00:42:25,355
Against the
agreement of the talent,

648
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:27,356
and I flipped my lid.

649
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:29,524
And, lo and behold,

650
00:42:29,626 --> 00:42:33,360
she goes and registers domains
in their names

651
00:42:33,995 --> 00:42:35,661
and then proceeds to...

652
00:42:36,463 --> 00:42:40,531
Release all their content on
to those particular websites.

653
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:53,909
<i>Alden: She was, like,
 sending me emails about, um,</i>

654
00:42:54,011 --> 00:42:55,243
<i> "what do you think
 your mother's</i>

655
00:42:55,345 --> 00:42:57,044
<i> gonna think about this?"</i>

656
00:42:57,513 --> 00:43:01,381
<i> And then, like, I'd be like,
 you know, "fuck you, bitch."</i>

657
00:43:01,483 --> 00:43:06,051
<i> And she'd be, like...
 Like, totally antagonizing.</i>

658
00:43:06,153 --> 00:43:10,889
<i> Like...
 I mean, she was such a cunt.</i>

659
00:43:15,561 --> 00:43:19,429
It was an assault not just on
me but on my family, you know?

660
00:43:20,498 --> 00:43:23,265
I mean, I couldn't have a more
conservative family, you know?

661
00:43:23,468 --> 00:43:27,169
I'm, I'm in a family full of
republican, military people,

662
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,705
and I'm a...
I was a professional banker.

663
00:43:30,807 --> 00:43:35,242
And here I am, like,
with basically a porn site,

664
00:43:35,344 --> 00:43:38,478
where I'm not naked, but,
i mean, I might as well be.

665
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,581
You know, this was
ruining my life at the time.

666
00:43:41,683 --> 00:43:42,848
That's how I felt.

667
00:43:43,083 --> 00:43:46,250
It certainly was affecting my
ability to function,

668
00:43:46,352 --> 00:43:51,921
because it was
so emotionally draining.

669
00:43:52,089 --> 00:43:57,324
Part of the reason was because
there's nobody to help me.

670
00:43:58,694 --> 00:44:02,829
It's like you lose control over,
you know, your life.

671
00:44:10,204 --> 00:44:13,938
<i>Dave: Well, that's when the,
 uh, crap started happening,</i>

672
00:44:14,106 --> 00:44:15,371
<i> uh, with me.</i>

673
00:44:16,474 --> 00:44:19,675
<i> Um, you decide,
 "okay, because I, uh,</i>

674
00:44:19,777 --> 00:44:22,778
<i> I closed down
 submissions for her,</i>

675
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,945
<i> and,</i>

676
00:44:23,947 --> 00:44:28,516
I guess, I basically was like
her tickling drug dealer,

677
00:44:28,885 --> 00:44:32,286
and, uh, since she wasn't
getting her drug any more,

678
00:44:32,388 --> 00:44:35,021
she was going through
tickle withdrawals.

679
00:44:36,858 --> 00:44:38,724
David: And what happened?

680
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:43,028
I started, uh,
receiving the, uh,

681
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:47,131
strange postcards,
and the, uh, strange messages.

682
00:44:47,967 --> 00:44:52,101
The, uh... the, uh, talent was
starting to receive messages.

683
00:44:52,636 --> 00:44:57,271
And, uh, she also deployed a
thing called the phone blaster,

684
00:44:57,373 --> 00:45:03,877
which was to call
everybody with obscene messages.

685
00:45:04,846 --> 00:45:08,614
Woman:

686
00:45:38,512 --> 00:45:40,644
<i> This person's on drugs.</i>

687
00:45:42,581 --> 00:45:46,516
This person's gotta be
on crystal or something,

688
00:45:47,185 --> 00:45:50,452
or taking cocaine up the ass,
or something like that.

689
00:45:51,254 --> 00:45:52,653
It was weird.

690
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:58,090
I'm glad to be able to make
this available to you.

691
00:45:58,192 --> 00:46:00,825
<i>David: David kept a number of
 letters Terri had sent him</i>

692
00:46:00,927 --> 00:46:03,961
<i> and was keen to show me
 the extent of the abuse.</i>

693
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:09,331
- All right.
- This is the magic stuff.

694
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:11,866
All right, what have we got?

695
00:46:16,071 --> 00:46:18,805
Yeah. Uh,
these are basically copies

696
00:46:18,907 --> 00:46:21,674
of what she would post online.

697
00:46:22,143 --> 00:46:23,876
So who's Barbara?
Is that your...?

698
00:46:23,978 --> 00:46:25,277
That's my mother.

699
00:46:25,979 --> 00:46:27,845
David: "Hairy and horny.
Hairy and horny.

700
00:46:27,947 --> 00:46:30,047
Jewish tickle filmer
David w. Starr

701
00:46:30,149 --> 00:46:31,615
is hook-nosed,
hairy and horny."

702
00:46:31,717 --> 00:46:37,153
She's used that tagline
for many, many, many times.

703
00:46:37,255 --> 00:46:38,387
What did your...?

704
00:46:38,756 --> 00:46:40,489
What did your mother
think of this stuff

705
00:46:40,591 --> 00:46:42,557
when this turned up? I mean...

706
00:46:42,659 --> 00:46:44,625
Actually, her phrase was, uh...

707
00:46:44,727 --> 00:46:47,728
Here's a, uh, note that she left
me because, uh,

708
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:49,796
she would hold these for me
in the mail

709
00:46:49,898 --> 00:46:53,032
and basically just say,
"here's another nasty thing."

710
00:46:53,134 --> 00:46:55,534
And that one actually
is unopened.

711
00:46:55,636 --> 00:46:58,303
I've never even opened
it to this date.

712
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:04,574
And let's see what our little
illustrious friend had to say.

713
00:47:05,076 --> 00:47:07,209
Oh, god. So it's a card.

714
00:47:08,979 --> 00:47:12,080
David: "Roses are red,
violets are bue."

715
00:47:12,182 --> 00:47:13,848
Can't spell worth shit.

716
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:16,684
"David w. Starr has
brought this upon you.

717
00:47:16,786 --> 00:47:19,753
Perhaps you wish,
perhaps instead,

718
00:47:19,855 --> 00:47:22,322
that David your failure,
not Edward, were dead."

719
00:47:22,424 --> 00:47:25,057
That's a reference to
my brother, who is dead.

720
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,761
That's, uh, really extreme.
A little bit psycho.

721
00:47:30,263 --> 00:47:32,429
But, I mean, what...? When you
were getting all this material

722
00:47:32,531 --> 00:47:35,231
and some of it's talking about
your brother who

723
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:36,732
- has passed away and...
- Uh-huh.

724
00:47:36,834 --> 00:47:38,066
Writing this stuff
to your mother,

725
00:47:38,168 --> 00:47:40,868
I mean, that,
that must have...

726
00:47:42,338 --> 00:47:45,605
I mean, that... that's not nice
receiving that on weekly basis.

727
00:47:45,707 --> 00:47:49,841
Uh, no, but it was on a
weekly basis, uh, yeah.

728
00:47:51,945 --> 00:47:53,777
Yeah, where did
they have the time?

729
00:47:56,047 --> 00:47:58,047
- Jeez, it's a birthday card.
- Yeah.

730
00:47:58,149 --> 00:47:59,515
"Happy birthday.

731
00:48:00,117 --> 00:48:04,885
Edward starr dead."
This is really cruel, right?

732
00:48:04,987 --> 00:48:06,286
It's very sick.

733
00:48:10,558 --> 00:48:12,925
<i>David: The more I hear
 about Terri disisto,</i>

734
00:48:13,027 --> 00:48:15,460
<i> the more she sounds
 like Jane o'brien.</i>

735
00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:19,630
<i> To state the obvious, they
 both really enjoy tickling.</i>

736
00:48:19,732 --> 00:48:22,699
<i> They also like being in
 control and lashing out.</i>

737
00:48:22,801 --> 00:48:24,533
I really appreciate it
and stay in touch.

738
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,203
<i>David: And it turns out
 Terri's habits started</i>

739
00:48:29,305 --> 00:48:31,638
<i> way before Dave starr
 got involved.</i>

740
00:48:32,073 --> 00:48:34,406
<i> I've found a journalist who'd
 spent a year uncovering</i>

741
00:48:34,508 --> 00:48:38,109
<i> the truth about Terri disisto
 during the '90s.</i>

 was to bait these boys</i>

<i> into making
 tickling videos with</i>

744

<i>things that they wanted, right?</i>

745
00:48:47,385 --> 00:48:49,151
You know, I mean,
imagine being a teenage boy,

746
00:48:49,253 --> 00:48:52,254
and, like, you get this random
email saying, you know,

747
00:48:52,356 --> 00:48:55,156
"i saw your posting about the
phish concert, and, uh,

how would you like to go?"

749
00:48:56,692 --> 00:48:59,159
Or, " I can send you
$1000 cash."

750
00:48:59,261 --> 00:49:00,727
And you're like...
You're living in your dorm

751
00:49:00,829 --> 00:49:03,629
at James Madison university.
You're like, "yeah, sure.

00:49:03,731 --> 00:49:06,931
You're gonna send me
$1000 cash. Right."

753
00:49:07,934 --> 00:49:10,467
<i>Fedex pulls up in front of your
 dorm the next day,</i>

754
00:49:10,569 --> 00:49:13,469
<i> and there is ten $100 bills.</i>

755
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:15,170
<i> You haven't done anything.</i>

756
00:49:17,274 --> 00:49:19,741
<i> She would just keep sending
 them whatever they wanted,</i>

757
00:49:19,843 --> 00:49:23,077
<i> you know. Computers,
 cameras, more cash,</i>

758
00:49:23,345 --> 00:49:25,411
<i> tickets to rock concerts.</i>

759
00:49:26,914 --> 00:49:29,915
<i> Then at some point,
 even a teenage boy</i>

760
00:49:30,017 --> 00:49:32,183
<i> has all the toys
 that they want.</i>

761
00:49:33,085 --> 00:49:35,285
<i> And they say, "i... I'm done."</i>

762
00:49:36,688 --> 00:49:41,490
<i> But I think the thing that
 she hates the most was no.</i>

763
00:49:41,758 --> 00:49:45,825
It was like...
A bomb went off.

764
00:49:48,462 --> 00:49:49,928
<i> And she'd say, "well,</i>

765
00:49:50,063 --> 00:49:53,931
<i> if you don't do it,
I'm gonna make your life hell."</i>

766
00:49:55,434 --> 00:49:57,434
<i> "I'm gonna send clips
 of these videos</i>

767
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,002
<i> to your wrestling coach."</i>

768
00:49:59,637 --> 00:50:02,037
<i> "I'm gonna send clips of
 these videos to your mom."</i>

769
00:50:02,139 --> 00:50:04,706
<i> "I'm gonna send clips of these
 videos to your grandmother."</i>

770
00:50:04,808 --> 00:50:06,307
<i> "I'm gonna send
 clips of these videos</i>

771
00:50:06,442 --> 00:50:08,608
<i> to the president
 of your university."</i>

772
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:10,209
<i> "I'm gonna post them
 all over the Internet."</i>

773
00:50:10,444 --> 00:50:13,111
"I'm gonna pretend to be you
and do things on the Internet

774
00:50:13,213 --> 00:50:15,780
that are gonna create a terrible
reputation for you."

775
00:50:15,882 --> 00:50:20,383
"I'm gonna shut down the entire
college campus computer system

776
00:50:20,485 --> 00:50:23,485
at your college, and they're
gonna think it's you."

777
00:50:25,823 --> 00:50:27,088
And then it happened.

778
00:50:41,704 --> 00:50:44,071
<i>Debbie: The first story I did
 was because</i>

779
00:50:44,506 --> 00:50:48,174
<i> she was attacking, um,
 drexel university.</i>

780
00:50:50,044 --> 00:50:54,179
And I found the student who, um,

781
00:50:54,948 --> 00:50:56,847
had made a number
of videos for her.

782
00:51:00,385 --> 00:51:03,652
<i> And when he came to
 Philadelphia to go to college,</i>

783
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,253
<i> she wanted him to
 continue making these videos,</i>

784
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:09,656
<i> and he wanted to cut off his
 relationship with her.</i>

785
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:12,691
<i> And she retaliated
 on so many levels.</i>

786
00:51:14,528 --> 00:51:16,294
<i> Their email servers' computers
 were being shut down</i>

787
00:51:16,396 --> 00:51:18,362
<i> with these
 denial-of-service attacks</i>

788
00:51:18,464 --> 00:51:21,164
<i> that indicated that they
 were coming from him.</i>

789
00:51:24,536 --> 00:51:26,369
<i> Email-bombing the white house,</i>

790
00:51:26,738 --> 00:51:28,771
<i> indicating that
 it came from him.</i>

791
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,673
<i> Yeah, that's pretty serious
 stuff when the secret service</i>

792
00:51:32,775 --> 00:51:36,176
<i> shows up in your college dorm
 and you're 19 years old.</i>

793
00:51:42,816 --> 00:51:45,683
<i> I was just curious,
 and I somehow</i>

794
00:51:45,785 --> 00:51:49,619
<i> started contacting
 Terri on aol.</i>

795
00:51:49,621 --> 00:51:50,886
<i> She had an account.</i>

796
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:55,890
<i> And we would have these
 chats late at night.</i>

797
00:51:56,792 --> 00:52:01,160
<i> And I was curious what kind of
 mind was behind this...</i>

798
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:04,062
<i> Celebrated Internet personage.</i>

799
00:52:05,131 --> 00:52:07,998
<i> And it was,
 it was kind of crazy.</i>

800
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,799
<i> We would have
 these conversations,</i>

801
00:52:11,802 --> 00:52:12,601
and she would...

802
00:52:12,602 --> 00:52:13,401
When she realized
that I did wine, she would say,

803
00:52:13,503 --> 00:52:16,570
"oh, I'm having a
glass of chardonnay!"

804
00:52:16,672 --> 00:52:20,673
And I could just hear this
voice because as it went on,

805
00:52:20,775 --> 00:52:23,876
it was almost like she was
completely intoxicated

806
00:52:24,111 --> 00:52:27,812
with this power
that she had to...

807
00:52:28,414 --> 00:52:30,414
To be so destructive
against people.

808
00:52:41,192 --> 00:52:45,260
<i>Hal: I got word about a kid
who refused to make the videos.</i>

809
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:49,497
<i> He posted that
 he needed some help,</i>

810
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,832
<i> and somebody said
 they would help him.</i>

811
00:52:55,504 --> 00:52:57,871
<i> And somehow he got
 emailed a file,</i>

812
00:52:59,207 --> 00:53:03,208
<i> and he was told, "if you email
 this zip file to Terri,</i>

813
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:04,942
<i> she will leave you alone."</i>

814
00:53:08,714 --> 00:53:10,580
And then he sent me
that zip file.

815
00:53:16,287 --> 00:53:18,853
<i> You know, and I remember
 opening it up and thinking...</i>

816
00:53:20,389 --> 00:53:23,857
"Wow! You know, this is it.
Like, this is...

817
00:53:24,292 --> 00:53:26,058
This is the smoking gun."

818
00:53:33,299 --> 00:53:36,767
<i>David: The zip file contained
 documents from her hard drive.</i>

819
00:53:36,869 --> 00:53:40,636
<i> As expected, there were files
 relating to tickling shoots.</i>

820
00:53:43,207 --> 00:53:48,310
<i> But they also revealed the
 true identity of Terri tickle.</i>

821
00:54:01,191 --> 00:54:02,590
<i>Hal: David d'amato.</i>

822
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:08,061
<i> She is really he, right?</i>

823
00:54:18,539 --> 00:54:21,605
<i>Debbie: He was an assistant
 principal in a high school?</i>

824
00:54:24,543 --> 00:54:25,808
<i> I just...</i>

825
00:54:28,946 --> 00:54:32,347
Couldn't believe it.

826
00:54:32,449 --> 00:54:35,082
I don't know why,
but it just seemed...

827
00:54:35,184 --> 00:54:38,985
Here is this sadistic person
exploiting these young people,

828
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,186
often underage,

829
00:54:43,089 --> 00:54:46,289
making their lives miserable,
embarrassing them,

830
00:54:47,025 --> 00:54:49,125
to an extent that it's every...

831
00:54:49,227 --> 00:54:53,028
It goes against everything that
an educator should be doing.

832
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:03,137
<i>Hal: When I did some more
 checking, I found out that</i>

833
00:55:03,239 --> 00:55:06,440
<i> he had worked at, like,
 eight schools in ten years.</i>

834
00:55:07,943 --> 00:55:09,609
Which to me was
always a red flag

835
00:55:09,711 --> 00:55:11,177
that there was something
else going on.

836
00:55:11,279 --> 00:55:14,146
I mean, that's more than
just sheer incompetence.

837
00:55:16,783 --> 00:55:20,618
<i> And then I found
social security numbers for her</i>

838
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,853
<i> that he had
 gotten fraudulently...</i>

839
00:55:23,622 --> 00:55:25,622
<i> With dead people's names.</i>

840
00:55:30,294 --> 00:55:34,696
<i> So I contacted the FBI.</i>

841
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:38,866
<i> I turned over all my
 information to them.</i>

842
00:55:40,436 --> 00:55:43,870
Within a week, they busted him.

843
00:55:56,751 --> 00:55:58,751
<i>Debbie: We were shocked
 at the sentencing</i>

844
00:55:58,953 --> 00:56:01,653
<i> because he got off so easy.</i>

845
00:56:01,755 --> 00:56:04,388
<i> For somebody who had done so
 much damage,</i>

846
00:56:05,657 --> 00:56:07,523
to me it was just extraordinary.

847
00:56:08,259 --> 00:56:10,826
And to not, to not have
restrictions on their

848
00:56:10,928 --> 00:56:15,029
Internet access after that,
how could...?

849
00:56:15,631 --> 00:56:18,498
And the... oh! And the idea that
he was going to law school

850
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,199
was just absurd.

851
00:56:22,703 --> 00:56:25,670
<i>David: It turns out
David d'amato's father, George,</i>

852
00:56:25,772 --> 00:56:28,506
<i>co-founded one of wall street's
 biggest law firms,</i>

853
00:56:28,608 --> 00:56:32,876
<i> d'amato & lynch, and David
 got a really great lawyer.</i>

854
00:56:33,378 --> 00:56:36,345
<i> Instead of prison, d'amato was
 allowed to serve his sentence</i>

855
00:56:36,447 --> 00:56:38,447
<i> in the halfway house
 while he studied law</i>

856
00:56:38,549 --> 00:56:42,116
<i> at his father's Alma mater,
 Fordham university.</i>

857
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,387
<i>Hal: The judge,
 for some reason,</i>

858
00:56:47,489 --> 00:56:50,890
<i> decided that he would endorse
 the law school path, right?</i>

859
00:56:51,792 --> 00:56:53,291
<i> Because, like, this is exactly
 the kind of person</i>

860
00:56:53,393 --> 00:56:55,126
<i>that should be a lawyer, right?</i>

861
00:56:55,228 --> 00:56:58,462
Somebody who has
defrauded people,

862
00:56:58,564 --> 00:57:00,530
somebody who has
stolen people's identities.

863
00:57:00,632 --> 00:57:02,264
A federal freakin' crime, right?

864
00:57:02,366 --> 00:57:05,600
I mean... like,
you know, stolen identity.

865
00:57:05,702 --> 00:57:07,802
Stolen a social security number
of a dead woman,

866
00:57:07,904 --> 00:57:09,870
of two dead people, right?

867
00:57:12,407 --> 00:57:16,141
<i> It said, "David d'amato,
 39, of garden city,</i>

868
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:19,077
<i> plead guilty
for two federal counts of</i>

869
00:57:19,179 --> 00:57:20,578
<i> computer fraud and abuse."</i>

870
00:57:23,883 --> 00:57:26,083
<i> Nothing about the tickling,</i>

871
00:57:26,185 --> 00:57:30,053
<i>nothing about the boys, nothing
 about the identity theft.</i>

872
00:57:30,188 --> 00:57:31,987
Zero. Nothing.

873
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:35,924
<i>David: Once Fordham became
aware of d'amato's convictions,</i>

874
00:57:36,026 --> 00:57:37,992
<i> his admission was revoked.</i>

875
00:57:38,094 --> 00:57:39,660
<i> No longer able to study law,</i>

876
00:57:39,762 --> 00:57:42,295
<i> d'amato finished
 his sentence in prison.</i>

877
00:57:42,697 --> 00:57:45,798
<i> But I've realized that
 didn't stop the tickling.</i>

878
00:57:46,867 --> 00:57:49,400
David: So, this is 2002. So this
is writing to David starr,

879
00:57:49,502 --> 00:57:51,635
who would shoot
these boys tickling

880
00:57:51,737 --> 00:57:53,470
and then send the videos...

881
00:57:54,773 --> 00:57:55,905
To Terri. That was a, that's--

882
00:57:56,007 --> 00:57:58,574
because she,
what she would have is...

883
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:01,276
- Do you want your glasses?
- Back in the early days...

884
00:58:01,378 --> 00:58:03,344
Yeah. Back in the early days...

885
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:11,218
Terri would have friends
tickle them and send them the...

886
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,520
They were amateur tapes.

887
00:58:13,622 --> 00:58:15,955
- These are now professional?
- Well, this is...

888
00:58:16,023 --> 00:58:17,589
- Look at the date on it.
- '02?

889
00:58:17,691 --> 00:58:18,890
Look at the date.

890
00:58:19,859 --> 00:58:23,026
- Is the "t" Terri?
- Yeah, it's Terri writing.

891
00:58:23,128 --> 00:58:27,296
So that was during, um,
lock-up time.

892
00:58:27,398 --> 00:58:30,198
Oh, in jail. I get it.

893
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:35,536
"David, a few other things.
Email... explain my illness."

894
00:58:35,638 --> 00:58:37,738
Oh. "Tell him I'll pay
everything owed

895
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,774
as soon as the mono is better."

896
00:58:40,876 --> 00:58:46,445
Oh. "Get headshots."
My god! Oh, my god!

897
00:58:47,848 --> 00:58:53,818
"I won't be online for a while
as I am very sick." Oh.

898
00:58:59,925 --> 00:59:04,560
- Couldn't stop.
- No. No.

899
00:59:06,497 --> 00:59:08,897
<i>David: It seems that
 since the mid-'90s,</i>

900
00:59:08,999 --> 00:59:11,933

00:59:15,103 --> 00:59:16,669
<i> His persona of Terri tickle</i>

903
00:59:16,771 --> 00:59:20,305
<i> seems to have dropped off the
 radar around 2006.</i>

904
00:59:21,074 --> 00:59:24,942
<i> A while later, Jane o'brien
 arrived on the scene.</i>

905
00:59:28,747 --> 00:59:30,646
<i> We've posted
 this theory online,</i>

906
00:59:30,748 --> 00:59:33,514
<i>and David d'amato is not happy.</i>

907
00:59:35,284 --> 00:59:38,952
<i> He's hired not one, but two
 private investigators,</i>

908
00:59:39,054 --> 00:59:41,787
<i> one in New Zealand
 and one in New York.</i>

909
00:59:43,457 --> 00:59:47,158
<i>The message is clear. They tell
 us to stop what we're doing</i>

910
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:50,961
<i> and that d'amato has nothing
 to do with Jane o'brien media.</i>

911
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:55,698
On top of that,

912
00:59:55,699 --> 00:59:57,432
<i> David d'amato has also hired
 a New Zealand lawyer.</i>

913
00:59:57,735 --> 01:00:00,268
<i> He's demanding
 an apology and retraction</i>

914
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:03,371
<i> or else he'll see us
 in a New Zealand court.</i>

915
01:00:12,614 --> 01:00:13,779
<i> We're now being attacked</i>

916
01:00:13,881 --> 01:00:16,214
<i> by Jane o'brien's lawyers
 on one side</i>

917
01:00:16,316 --> 01:00:18,649
<i> and David d'amato's
 on the other,</i>

918
01:00:19,151 --> 01:00:22,951
<i> both insisting they have
 nothing to do with each other.</i>

919
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,154
<i> Once again, we're way
 out of our depth.</i>

920
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:30,891
<i> Things get even more surreal</i>

921
01:00:30,959 --> 01:00:32,892
<i> with a phone call
 from Michigan,</i>

922
01:00:32,994 --> 01:00:35,361
<i> where there's a very different
 tickling operation</i>

923
01:00:35,463 --> 01:00:37,296
<i> also being run by Jane.</i>

924
01:00:40,567 --> 01:00:44,468
Jordan:

925
01:01:24,976 --> 01:01:27,276
<i>David: So, like,
 crime is pretty high--</i>

926
01:01:27,444 --> 01:01:29,076
<i>- Jordan: Yeah--
 - ...Here, right?</i>

927
01:01:29,178 --> 01:01:34,013
<i> Murder, robberies, um, rape,
 I mean, theft.</i>

928
01:01:34,115 --> 01:01:35,881
It's all up there,

929
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:39,284
especially for being as small,
um, as what it is.

930
01:01:39,386 --> 01:01:41,285
We've made it now, uh,

931
01:01:41,387 --> 01:01:45,755
on to the top 100 most dangerous
cities in the United States.

932
01:01:46,457 --> 01:01:48,190
<i>David:
 Do you think on some level</i>

933
01:01:48,292 --> 01:01:51,559
<i> Jane kind of directed things
here because it is a poor area?</i>

934
01:01:51,661 --> 01:01:55,262
Yeah, you know,
the poverty level, you know,

935
01:01:55,364 --> 01:01:56,930
- is easy to target, you know.
- Mm.

936
01:01:57,032 --> 01:01:59,465
Thousands of dollars
in kids' hands is...

937
01:01:59,567 --> 01:02:01,466
That's a,
that's a big, big deal.

938
01:02:48,275 --> 01:02:54,011
<i>David: Jane has taken a liking
 to one of muskegon's main
 sports, mixed martial arts.</i>

939
01:02:54,113 --> 01:02:58,281
<i> A group of young, athletic men
 desperate for extra money.</i>

940
01:03:19,904 --> 01:03:22,971
<i>Jordan: That's what
 she was trying to do,
 is break into the mma world.</i>

941
01:03:23,974 --> 01:03:26,507
<i> Because it's not illegal
 to tickle somebody</i>

942
01:03:26,609 --> 01:03:29,543
<i> to get out of a submission
 in mixed martial arts.</i>

943
01:03:30,312 --> 01:03:31,811
<i> Like, she was trying
 to pitch that</i>

944
01:03:31,913 --> 01:03:32,811
<i> because she, like,</i>

945
01:03:32,813 --> 01:03:35,547
<i> looked it up in all the rules
 and everything.</i>

946
01:03:36,483 --> 01:03:39,984
But if you tickle a guy in the
middle of that ring

947
01:03:40,086 --> 01:03:41,685
to get out of a submission,

948
01:03:41,787 --> 01:03:44,387
you might step out of the cage
and get punched in the face.

949
01:03:45,123 --> 01:03:49,725
Like, never in a million years
out of all my fights

950
01:03:49,893 --> 01:03:52,526
would I ever try to
tickle somebody

951
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:56,062
to get out of a submission.
Fuck, no!

952
01:04:13,343 --> 01:04:14,809
<i>David: As an ex-fighter,</i>

953
01:04:14,911 --> 01:04:18,379
<i> Jordan was paid to recruit
 tickling talent in the town.</i>

954
01:04:18,481 --> 01:04:22,315
<i> He's the only one in muskegon
 prepared to appear on camera.</i>

955
01:04:23,618 --> 01:04:29,821
<i> She offered my one buddy a
 2014 Chevy cruze and $30,000.</i>

956
01:04:30,256 --> 01:04:32,422
- What? What for? To tickle?
- Yeah.

957
01:04:32,590 --> 01:04:35,891
Just 'cause, like,
she liked him.

958
01:04:35,993 --> 01:04:37,158
Yeah, right. She...
He was a favorite.

959
01:04:37,326 --> 01:04:38,692
- Like, yeah.
- Yeah.

960
01:04:38,794 --> 01:04:41,227
Asians and redheads
are what they call premiums.

961
01:04:41,329 --> 01:04:43,729
If you get those, like,
she gives you bonuses.

962
01:04:44,364 --> 01:04:46,330
I'm Jordan schillaci,
and this is cet.

963
01:04:46,432 --> 01:04:48,598
Uh, we're gonna be
having a discussion,

964
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:51,434
more of a debate today about
whether tickling

965
01:04:51,536 --> 01:04:54,670
is effective in
a combat situation.

966
01:04:59,009 --> 01:05:00,842
<i> We ended up setting up
 a tickle cell. Like,</i>

967
01:05:01,044 --> 01:05:02,243
<i> where you get guys to come in,</i>

968
01:05:02,345 --> 01:05:05,012
<i> "we'll pay you and you
 pay them to audition."</i>

969
01:05:05,114 --> 01:05:07,947
No!

970
01:05:10,484 --> 01:05:13,051
<i> So we'd choose a hotel,
 nothing fancy,</i>

971
01:05:13,153 --> 01:05:17,188
<i> and, uh, the guys would come
 in and hang out, you know,</i>

972
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:21,591
<i> smoke, drink, eat pizza,
 fuckin', and we'd hurry up</i>

973
01:05:21,693 --> 01:05:25,094
<i> and run through, you know,
 five, six, seven guys.</i>

974
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:33,134
So you're... you were looking
after the tickle cell in
muskegon?

975
01:05:33,236 --> 01:05:35,402
Yeah, they have them set up
all over the us.

976
01:05:35,504 --> 01:05:39,272
Ohio, Michigan,
Florida, New York.

977
01:05:39,374 --> 01:05:41,240
- I mean, they're everywhere.
- Right.

978
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,375
- And they're all for Jane?
- Yeah.

979
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:45,276
Fuckin' hell.

980
01:05:51,316 --> 01:05:52,782
<i>Jordan: Well, that's where
 a lot of people started</i>

981
01:05:52,884 --> 01:05:54,583
<i> getting really
 really upset, man.</i>

982
01:05:54,685 --> 01:05:55,917
<i> Because all of sudden
 these videos</i>

983
01:05:55,919 --> 01:05:58,085
<i> that are supposed to be
just auditions were on YouTube,</i>

984
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:01,088
<i> vimeo, and every other
 site you could imagine.</i>

985
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:03,489
<i> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 - Nobody was okay with that.</i>

986
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:07,492
<i> One of the guys, Brodie,</i>

987
01:06:07,594 --> 01:06:10,761
<i>like, his family was very upset
 with him. It was all over.</i>

988
01:06:10,863 --> 01:06:13,530
<i>Like, people just picked on him
 and picked on him.</i>

989
01:06:14,266 --> 01:06:17,200
<i> You know, he was underage,
 still in school.</i>

990
01:06:17,502 --> 01:06:19,768
And it wasn't supposed
to go out on the Internet.

991
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:22,537
It wasn't supposed to be put up,
and, uh,

992
01:06:22,672 --> 01:06:26,373
you know,
that just kind of sucked.

993
01:06:26,475 --> 01:06:28,608
Because, like I said,
it took Brodie...

994
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:30,042
It hit one of the hardest.

995
01:06:30,144 --> 01:06:31,676
Like, this whole situation

996
01:06:31,778 --> 01:06:34,178
and then being underage
and his parents.

997
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:36,413
Who do you have to turn to?
Who are you going to attack?

998
01:06:36,515 --> 01:06:39,949
No... Jane o'brien's a ghost.
Nobody knows who it is.

999
01:06:42,153 --> 01:06:43,752
<i>Jordan: Cody-bear, no.</i>

1000
01:06:44,721 --> 01:06:47,254
This is Colton,
this is my nephew.

1001
01:06:47,356 --> 01:06:49,122
- David: Hey, man.
- Colton, how old are you?

1002
01:06:50,125 --> 01:06:51,424
How old are you?

1003
01:06:51,626 --> 01:06:52,891
- Three.
- You're three?

1004
01:06:52,993 --> 01:06:54,525
You're three? All right.

1005
01:06:55,327 --> 01:06:57,393
- I'm David.
- I'm Phil. How are you doing?

1006
01:06:57,495 --> 01:06:58,760
It's nice to meet you, sir.

1007
01:06:59,829 --> 01:07:02,262
I was really, really reluctant

1008
01:07:02,364 --> 01:07:03,896
when Jordan
started talking about this.

1009
01:07:04,031 --> 01:07:07,132
And he's like, "this lady seems
straight and legit, mom."

1010
01:07:07,234 --> 01:07:10,535
I'm like, you know,
"these... these boys are young."

1011
01:07:10,637 --> 01:07:14,071
It's easy to believe,
but when you're an old mom,

1012
01:07:14,506 --> 01:07:17,273
you're a little more leery
for the boys, and,

1013
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:20,409
I was very leery
right from get-go

1014
01:07:20,511 --> 01:07:22,577
that the boys were
gonna get into trouble

1015
01:07:22,679 --> 01:07:24,478
and this was not legit.

1016
01:07:34,822 --> 01:07:36,721
<i>Jordan: She has all the money in
 the world, it seems like,</i>

1017
01:07:36,823 --> 01:07:39,056
<i> whoever it is,
 to be able to do this.</i>

1018
01:07:39,158 --> 01:07:42,458
<i> But they're waiting for
 that day that you rely</i>

1019
01:07:43,227 --> 01:07:45,393
<i> on that as a sole income.</i>

1020
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:47,761
<i> That was her big,
 I think, power trip.</i>

1021
01:07:47,863 --> 01:07:51,497
<i> She waited until a bunch of
 us relied on that income</i>

1022
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:54,132
because that was our
only source of income.

1023
01:07:54,234 --> 01:07:55,967
We'd been doing it for so long,
we didn't think...

1024
01:07:56,069 --> 01:07:58,669
She waited until she had
complete control,

1025
01:07:58,771 --> 01:08:01,138
basically, over your situation,

1026
01:08:01,507 --> 01:08:03,006
and that's when she
wanted to yank that rug

1027
01:08:03,108 --> 01:08:04,640
right out from under you.

1028
01:08:09,513 --> 01:08:12,680
David: David d'amato. Have you
heard that name before?

1029
01:08:13,215 --> 01:08:14,847
In relation to all this stuff?

1030
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:19,450
I am literally, like,
trembling right now.

1031
01:08:19,552 --> 01:08:20,651
Are you actually shaking?

1032
01:08:20,653 --> 01:08:24,755
Yeah, I'm actually, like,
shaking. Like, I'm not, like...

1033
01:08:24,857 --> 01:08:27,791
Like I said, like, from being
from here, I don't take shit.

1034
01:08:27,893 --> 01:08:30,994
Like, if I met up with that guy,
I'd punch him right out.

1035
01:08:31,096 --> 01:08:33,296
And when he woke up, he'd be
strapped to a chair with a...

1036
01:08:33,398 --> 01:08:34,463
Like, I'd be like,

1037
01:08:34,631 --> 01:08:35,997
"dude, you're telling me
everything right now."

1038
01:08:43,272 --> 01:08:45,605
<i>David: The tickling's still
 happening in this town.</i>

1039

<i> Like, england,
 Australia, Italy.</i>

1044

<i> I mean, the money's
 still coming and going.</i>

<i>David: This tickling empire</i>

1046

01:09:52,931 --> 01:09:56,866
I can feel the rich/bad aura.

1049
01:09:59,470 --> 01:10:02,404
<i> David d'amato's address is
 listed in garden city,</i>

1050
01:10:02,506 --> 01:10:04,905
<i> an affluent suburb
 of long island.</i>

1051
01:10:07,509 --> 01:10:10,076
<i> He lives on the top floor
 of this building.</i>

1052
01:10:11,612 --> 01:10:12,777
<i>Lance:
 Lance Roberts speaking.</i>

1053
01:10:12,879 --> 01:10:14,545
<i>David:
 Oh, hi. It's David speaking.</i>

1054
01:10:14,647 --> 01:10:17,280
<i> I just wanted to talk to
 David d'amato.</i>

1055
01:10:17,649 --> 01:10:20,416
<i>Lance: Um, okay. I can't
 give you his phone number.</i>

1056
01:10:20,551 --> 01:10:21,716
<i> I really can't even
 give you any</i>

1057
01:10:21,818 --> 01:10:23,517
<i> personal information on him.</i>

1058
01:10:23,952 --> 01:10:25,017
<i>David: Okay.</i>

1059
01:10:25,452 --> 01:10:26,751
<i>Lance: Do you know him?</i>

1060
01:10:26,853 --> 01:10:29,553
<i>-  Yes, I do. Yes.
- You're a friend of his?</i>

1061
01:10:29,655 --> 01:10:32,355
<i> Um, I'm not a friend, no,
 but I've, um...</i>

1062
01:10:32,457 --> 01:10:33,956
<i> I've been trying to get
 in touch with him</i>

1063
01:10:34,058 --> 01:10:35,424
<i> but have been struggling.</i>

1064
01:10:36,226 --> 01:10:37,291
<i>Lance: Okay, what I do is,</i>

1065
01:10:37,393 --> 01:10:39,226
<i> I have a way of leaving him
 a message.</i>

1066
01:10:40,162 --> 01:10:42,395
<i> I can't guarantee that
 he's gonna call you back</i>

1067
01:10:42,497 --> 01:10:43,596
<i> if he doesn't know you.</i>

1068
01:10:43,598 --> 01:10:46,465
<i>- Okay, thank you so much. Bye.
 - You're welcome.</i>

1069
01:10:53,905 --> 01:10:55,871
<i>David:
 D'amato never calls us back,</i>

1070
01:10:55,973 --> 01:10:59,107
<i> and we've got no other way to
 contact him directly.</i>

1071
01:11:01,377 --> 01:11:02,642
So annoying.

1072
01:11:08,549 --> 01:11:10,615
It's all right.
There's still tomorrow.

1073
01:11:14,519 --> 01:11:17,619
<i>David: But that night we get a
 frustrating phone call.</i>

1074
01:11:18,922 --> 01:11:21,555
My concern is that we can't
do more or less anything

1075
01:11:21,657 --> 01:11:23,323
we have planned for
the rest of the trip.

1076
01:11:24,726 --> 01:11:26,558
I know. It's, like,
it's fuckin' insane.

1077
01:11:28,595 --> 01:11:30,260
Okay. Bye-bye.

1078
01:11:33,098 --> 01:11:36,065
<i>David: All the threats are
 worrying our film's producer.</i>

1079
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:37,900
<i> He doesn't want us
 to risk provoking</i>

1080
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:40,502
<i> any further legal action
 from d'amato.</i>

1081
01:11:41,037 --> 01:11:41,935
So he's saying,

1082
01:11:41,937 --> 01:11:43,803
"well, what if you do everything
that you were gonna do,

1083
01:11:43,805 --> 01:11:46,005
except don't go and
chase d'amato down?"

1084
01:11:46,107 --> 01:11:47,739
And I'm like,
"well, anything we do

1085
01:11:47,841 --> 01:11:49,774
that lets d'amato know we're
looking into him again."

1086
01:11:49,876 --> 01:11:51,742
- Well, from now on in is that.
- Yeah, literally.

1087
01:11:51,844 --> 01:11:54,510
So he says, "well, maybe we cut
the thing short, then.

1088
01:11:55,346 --> 01:11:56,645
Just go home."

1089
01:11:57,681 --> 01:11:59,514
I know it's like...
It's fuckin' insane.

1090
01:12:09,759 --> 01:12:13,127
<i>David: The next day we put
 chasing d'amato on hold.</i>

1091
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:18,432
<i> I want to know how on earth</i>

1092
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:20,967
<i> a former deputy principal
 pays for all this.</i>

1093
01:12:21,569 --> 01:12:24,970
<i> We can't find any sign he's
 earning money from the videos,</i>

1094
01:12:25,072 --> 01:12:27,705
<i> but he's spending lots
 of money making them.</i>

1095
01:12:28,207 --> 01:12:31,541
<i> He's flying up to ten people
 into la almost every month</i>

1096
01:12:31,643 --> 01:12:33,576
<i> from all
 over the world,</i>

1097
01:12:33,678 --> 01:12:35,210
<i> putting them up
 in a nice hotel,</i>

1098
01:12:35,312 --> 01:12:37,645
<i> paying them thousands in cash.</i>

1099
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,746
<i> And that's not even taking
 into account</i>

1100
01:12:39,848 --> 01:12:41,147
<i> the cost of running
 tickle cells,</i>

1101
01:12:41,249 --> 01:12:43,082
<i> like the one in muskegon.</i>

1102
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:47,318
<i> Both David's parents
 are now deceased,</i>

1103
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:50,287
<i> but his father's law firm is
 one of wall street's biggest.</i>

1104
01:12:51,056 --> 01:12:53,222
<i> Maybe David is
 reaping the benefits</i>

1105
01:12:53,224 --> 01:12:54,957
<i> of his father's empire.</i>

1106
01:12:57,528 --> 01:12:58,793
<i>Woman:
 D'amato & lynch.</i>

1107
01:12:58,895 --> 01:13:02,795
Oh, hi.
I just had an inquiry, um,

1108
01:13:02,897 --> 01:13:06,498
about the relationship with,
uh, um,

1109
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:11,135
David d'amato with the company,
the son of George d'amato.

1110
01:13:11,237 --> 01:13:13,237
Is there someone I could
talk to about this?

1111
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:19,074
<i> No, I'm sorry. And Mr. d'amato
 has been gone for a long time.</i>

1112
01:13:19,443 --> 01:13:24,845
Yeah, yeah. I'm looking into the
background to his son, David.

1113
01:13:24,947 --> 01:13:26,780
And I'm just trying to figure
out whether he's got

1114
01:13:26,882 --> 01:13:29,916
any financial relationship
with the company still.

1115
01:13:30,018 --> 01:13:33,652
<i> No, I... I really don't know.
 I'm sorry, I can't help you.</i>

1116
01:13:33,754 --> 01:13:37,622
Is there someone I could talk to
at d'amato & lynch to find out?

1117
01:13:38,558 --> 01:13:41,959
<i>Mm. Not that I believe, no.
 I'm sorry.</i>

1118
01:13:42,061 --> 01:13:44,528
Okay, but there must be a
way to find out, surely?

1119
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:48,965
<i> - Um, not here. Thank you.</i>

1120
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:04,680
<i>Woman: I haven't seen David
 in quite a few years.</i>

1121
01:14:04,782 --> 01:14:06,348
<i>I have no knowledge of him now.</i>

1122
01:14:06,983 --> 01:14:09,683
<i> Not in many years have I
 had any contact with him,</i>

1123
01:14:09,785 --> 01:14:11,951
<i> so I really couldn't give
 you any information.</i>

1124
01:14:12,053 --> 01:14:14,987
<i>David: Yeah, he's been
 pretty aggressive towards me,</i>

1125
01:14:15,089 --> 01:14:17,789
<i> so I'm just trying to figure
 out what his motivations are--</i>

1126
01:14:17,891 --> 01:14:19,991
<i>woman: Get away from him,
 that's all I can tell you.</i>

1127
01:14:20,893 --> 01:14:24,060
<i>- David: Really?
 - Yeah. Stay away from him.</i>

1128
01:14:35,339 --> 01:14:37,305
<i>David: This was every
 conversation I had</i>

1129
01:14:37,407 --> 01:14:41,008
<i> with anyone even remotely
 related to David d'amato.</i>

1130
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:44,244
<i> "I can't tell you anything,
 but stay away."</i>

1131
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:46,813
<i> But all I want to
 do is the opposite.</i>

1132
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:50,383
<i> Someone has to confront this
 bully, lawsuits or not.</i>

1133
01:15:04,331 --> 01:15:08,366
Dylan: Okay. So, this is the car
we're looking for.

1134
01:15:08,468 --> 01:15:12,102
It's a Mercedes benz ml430.

1135
01:15:17,875 --> 01:15:21,076
<i>David: David d'amato has gone
 out of his way to avoid us.</i>

1136
01:15:21,178 --> 01:15:24,045
<i> We figure if we wait outside
 his apartment long enough,</i>

1137
01:15:24,147 --> 01:15:26,113
<i>eventually he'll have to leave.</i>

1138
01:15:27,116 --> 01:15:29,282
Dylan: So, that's a Chevrolet.

1139
01:15:30,518 --> 01:15:31,884
Oh, hang on a second,
what's this?

1140
01:15:31,986 --> 01:15:33,085
What's this? What's this?

1141
01:15:33,887 --> 01:15:35,419
Okay, there's a car there.
I can see it.

1142
01:15:35,521 --> 01:15:37,687
Now, just in the edge. Hang on.

1143
01:15:43,728 --> 01:15:45,194
David: A grand cherokee.

1144
01:15:47,164 --> 01:15:48,429
Well, maybe just a cherokee.

1145
01:15:48,531 --> 01:15:50,397
But it's certainly
not a Mercedes.

1146
01:15:56,371 --> 01:15:59,572
- David: What's the time?
- Dylan: 2:44.

1147
01:15:59,674 --> 01:16:02,574
So we've been here for,
like, four hours?

1148
01:16:06,646 --> 01:16:09,446
<i>David: We've been waiting
 like this for days.</i>

1149
01:16:10,715 --> 01:16:11,780
Dylan: Come on.

1150
01:16:11,782 --> 01:16:14,816
<i>David: And it seems like
 he'll never come out.</i>

1151
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:18,786
Dylan: Okay. Let me just check.
It's also...

1152
01:16:18,888 --> 01:16:23,924
It is the right type of car.
It's got white plates.

1153
01:16:24,559 --> 01:16:26,392
Hang on. Hang on. Okay.

1154
01:16:28,195 --> 01:16:29,794
It's him. It's him.
It's him. It's him.

1155
01:16:33,166 --> 01:16:35,132
He's coming out. Just wait here.

1156
01:16:35,234 --> 01:16:37,500
Just sit here.
All right, stay cool.

1157
01:16:38,603 --> 01:16:39,935
Okay, I'm gonna...

1158
01:16:47,076 --> 01:16:48,408
Okay, he's up here.

1159
01:16:56,083 --> 01:16:57,949
He's in the right-hand...
Is he in the left-hand Lane?

1160
01:16:58,051 --> 01:16:59,350
David: Yeah.

1161
01:17:02,553 --> 01:17:03,785
He hasn't turned right.
He's in...

1162
01:17:03,887 --> 01:17:04,952
Whoa! You're one car behind him.

1163
01:17:05,054 --> 01:17:07,821
You're right in his...
In his mirror now.

1164
01:17:26,038 --> 01:17:28,637
- I'm breathing heavily.
- Yeah, same.

1165
01:17:29,806 --> 01:17:32,306
Dylan: Okay. Okay. It's cool.

1166
01:17:32,441 --> 01:17:34,307
We're right behind him now,
so back off a bit,

1167
01:17:34,409 --> 01:17:35,874
so we're not gonna be too close.

1168
01:17:37,978 --> 01:17:39,544
Okay.

1169
01:17:40,914 --> 01:17:43,314
Just stay... stay back.
Stay back, David.

1170
01:17:43,616 --> 01:17:45,148
We're gonna have to
stop right behind him now.

1171
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:47,216
You might have to take the
camera off the tripod, dom.

1172
01:17:48,385 --> 01:17:50,151
David: Yeah, camera
off tripod, please.

1173
01:17:51,921 --> 01:17:53,186
Dylan: Starbucks?
Okay, this is perfect.

1174
01:17:53,288 --> 01:17:54,487
David: Okay. He'll be a while.

1175
01:17:55,756 --> 01:17:58,055
Okay. I'm just gonna go and have
conversation when he comes out.

1176
01:18:00,259 --> 01:18:02,058
You've... I've got my
phone if you need me.

1177
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:03,492
Okay.

1178
01:18:15,572 --> 01:18:17,371
<i>David: I'm about to meet
 this man who's been</i>

1179
01:18:17,473 --> 01:18:18,872
<i> such a threatening figure</i>

1180
01:18:18,974 --> 01:18:22,174
<i> in so many lives,
 including my own,</i>

1181
01:18:23,911 --> 01:18:27,078
<i> and I have simply no idea
 what to expect.</i>

1182
01:18:52,204 --> 01:18:55,338
- Dylan: He's coming out.
- David: Mr. d'amato.

1183
01:18:56,107 --> 01:18:58,674
- Hi, it's Dave farrier.
- D'amato:

1184
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:00,408
David: Hey, how are you?

1185
01:19:01,677 --> 01:19:03,443
D'amato:

1186
01:19:03,611 --> 01:19:06,577
David: I just wanted
to talk to you briefly.

1187
01:19:07,446 --> 01:19:08,745
If I could.

1188
01:19:09,981 --> 01:19:12,514
Because I was just...
I'm just worried about...

1189
01:19:15,619 --> 01:19:17,051
The legal letters
you've sent me,

1190
01:19:17,186 --> 01:19:18,585
and I just wanted to know
if we could

1191
01:19:18,788 --> 01:19:20,487
just talk about it face-to-face.

1192
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:23,323
D'amato:

1193
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:24,790
David: Is there?

1194
01:19:24,892 --> 01:19:28,326
D'amato:

1195
01:19:35,401 --> 01:19:38,301
I'm on a journalism visa,
so I'm, I'm okay to be here.

1196
01:19:38,403 --> 01:19:40,235
I'm okay to be here.
But I just...

1197
01:19:42,405 --> 01:19:44,138
Could we just talk a
little bit about--

1198
01:19:45,107 --> 01:19:47,173
I just wanted to find
out what's going on.

1199
01:19:47,441 --> 01:19:48,740
D'amato:

1200
01:19:48,842 --> 01:19:52,342
Because the last heard I was
gonna be in a us court

1201
01:19:52,477 --> 01:19:53,576
and a New Zealand court,

1202
01:19:53,578 --> 01:19:56,211
and I really just wanted to
sort this out face-to-face.

1203
01:19:56,313 --> 01:19:57,545
D'amato:

1204
01:19:57,647 --> 01:19:58,979
And I just want to sort of...

1205
01:19:59,081 --> 01:20:00,480
I mean,
I'm not here to antagonize.

1206
01:20:00,582 --> 01:20:03,015
I just genuinely want
to be able to help out.

1207
01:20:03,117 --> 01:20:05,350
D'amato:

1208
01:20:05,452 --> 01:20:07,251
Well, you did say you were
gonna sue me.

1209
01:20:07,519 --> 01:20:09,352
And I just wanna sort this
issue out.

1210
01:20:10,788 --> 01:20:12,521
D'amato:

1211
01:20:12,623 --> 01:20:14,589
Could you contact me
if possible?

1212
01:20:39,114 --> 01:20:41,347
<i>David: I went away feeling numb.</i>

1213
01:20:41,615 --> 01:20:45,382
<i> D'amato was calm, going
 instantly to legal threats,</i>

1214
01:20:45,884 --> 01:20:49,552
<i>which is what he's always done,
 I suppose, as Terri,</i>

1215
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:51,386
<i> as Jane,</i>

1216
01:20:52,021 --> 01:20:53,220
<i> as himself.</i>

1217
01:20:59,660 --> 01:21:02,927
<i> But after all this, I still
 couldn't help but wonder</i>

1218
01:21:03,029 --> 01:21:04,928
<i> were we totally certain that
 d'amato</i>

1219
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:08,364
<i> really was Jane and Debbie?
 Could we be wrong?</i>

1220
01:21:09,533 --> 01:21:11,866
<i> So we went back to
 where it all started,</i>

1221
01:21:11,968 --> 01:21:13,467
<i> those 300 domain names</i>

1222
01:21:13,569 --> 01:21:16,202
<i> connected to
 the nederdietsen group.</i>

1223
01:21:18,839 --> 01:21:21,539
<i> And that's when things
 went a little crazy.</i>

1224
01:21:22,041 --> 01:21:23,440
<i> On one of those
 domain names</i>

1225
01:21:23,542 --> 01:21:25,542
<i> there was
 just a directory listing,</i>

1226
01:21:25,877 --> 01:21:28,777
<i> including a folder called
 "my documents".</i>

1227
01:21:32,215 --> 01:21:33,981
<i> It looks like d'amato
 has accidently</i>

1228
01:21:34,083 --> 01:21:36,950
<i> made hundreds of his
 private files public</i>

1229
01:21:37,352 --> 01:21:38,718
<i> on the Internet.</i>

1230
01:21:44,358 --> 01:21:46,091
<i> There's d'amato's signature</i>

1231
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:48,992
<i> on a nederdietsen
 registration form.</i>

1232
01:21:51,896 --> 01:21:54,663
<i> There's also a contract with
 the investigation company</i>

1233
01:21:54,765 --> 01:21:56,397
<i> he hired to look into us.</i>

1234
01:21:56,866 --> 01:21:58,665
<i>The address is exactly the same</i>

1235
01:21:58,767 --> 01:22:01,100
<i> as the address used by
 Jane o'brien media</i>

1236
01:22:01,202 --> 01:22:04,102
<i> when booking rooms at the
 Hilton in New Zealand.</i>

1237
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:09,173
<i> Then there are documents
 and signatures</i>

1238
01:22:09,275 --> 01:22:11,941
<i> for Debbie kuhn
 and Jane o'brien...</i>

1239
01:22:13,844 --> 01:22:16,444
<i> Who's also got her
 own credit card.</i>

1240
01:22:17,613 --> 01:22:19,079
<i> And it turns out that d'amato</i>

1241
01:22:19,214 --> 01:22:21,347
<i> did finally
 get that law degree,</i>

1242
01:22:21,449 --> 01:22:24,450
<i> from hofstra university
 in 2011.</i>

1243
01:22:26,587 --> 01:22:29,588
<i>He's also been telling the boys
 to enter the United States</i>

1244
01:22:29,690 --> 01:22:32,757
<i> on a tourist visa,
 even though they're working.</i>

1245
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:35,759
<i> And it's finally clear to me</i>

1246
01:22:35,861 --> 01:22:38,127
<i> how he funds
 his tickling empire.</i>

1247
01:22:40,297 --> 01:22:41,863
<i> As of late 2012,</i>

1248
01:22:41,965 --> 01:22:45,298
<i> he had almost six million
 in his checking account.</i>

1249
01:22:46,434 --> 01:22:49,168
<i>And his living expenses were
 being paid by a trust</i>

1250
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:51,169
<i> established by his father.</i>

1251
01:22:54,641 --> 01:22:57,475
<i>He also inherited millions from
 his mother's estate</i>

1252
01:22:57,577 --> 01:22:59,609
<i> when she died in 2014.</i>

1253
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:04,146
<i> It's all family money.</i>

1254
01:23:07,751 --> 01:23:09,684
<i> There are also lots of emails</i>

1255
01:23:09,786 --> 01:23:12,219
<i> sent from Jane o'brien's
 legal department.</i>

1256
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:17,289
<i> With this in mind, we call
 in to see Romeo salta,</i>

1257
01:23:17,391 --> 01:23:19,691
<i> the lawyer hired
 by Jane o'brien media</i>

1258
01:23:19,793 --> 01:23:22,293
<i> who's been sending us all
 the legal threats.</i>

1259
01:23:23,062 --> 01:23:25,362
<i> We want to ask him about
 the correspondence</i>

1260
01:23:25,464 --> 01:23:27,130
<i> his office has sent us.</i>

1261
01:23:27,632 --> 01:23:29,865
<i>David: But I just thought
 you'd be curious to see...</i>

1262
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,633
<i> Things been issued
 in la county court,</i>

1263
01:23:32,735 --> 01:23:34,668
<i> that's signed off here
 with your name.</i>

1264
01:23:35,103 --> 01:23:37,803
<i>There's another example of that
 with that email address.</i>

1265
01:23:37,905 --> 01:23:38,803
<i>Romeo: Yeah.</i>

1266
01:23:38,805 --> 01:23:41,505
To that, as opposed to you.
I mean, we got the one
from you originally,

1267
01:23:41,507 --> 01:23:43,206
which we... it's fine. We don't
need to talk about that.

1268
01:23:43,308 --> 01:23:45,207
It's very simple.
I only sent one.

1269
01:23:45,309 --> 01:23:46,374
Dylan: Yeah.

1270
01:23:46,476 --> 01:23:47,541
David: Yeah.

1271
01:23:47,643 --> 01:23:49,042
- There's your answer.
- Yeah.

1272
01:23:50,612 --> 01:23:52,378
Romeo: I'll see what I can do to
make those stop.

1273
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:53,812
Have they stopped?

1274
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:55,346
Dylan: Uh, we haven't heard
anything for a little while.

1275
01:23:55,448 --> 01:23:56,480
They're listing your address

1276
01:23:56,582 --> 01:23:58,214
as their corporate headquarters,
though.

1277
01:24:00,318 --> 01:24:02,017
- My address?
- Yeah, if you look at...

1278
01:24:02,119 --> 01:24:03,184
David: Your office.

1279
01:24:04,687 --> 01:24:05,753
Dylan: Janeobrienmedia.Com,

1280
01:24:05,754 --> 01:24:06,820
your address is listed as their
corporate headquarters.

1281
01:24:07,189 --> 01:24:09,088
Yeah, but it's not my--

1282
01:24:09,190 --> 01:24:10,689
Dylan: No, no.
On their website at the bottom.

1283
01:24:10,791 --> 01:24:12,490
Romeo: But it's not, um...

1284
01:24:12,859 --> 01:24:14,258
Dylan: I don't know if it's...

1285
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:15,525
It says
"office of corporate counsel

1286
01:24:15,627 --> 01:24:16,892
and New York headquarters."

1287
01:24:16,994 --> 01:24:18,259
Romeo: Well, that's my address.

1288
01:24:19,695 --> 01:24:21,311
David: Yeah.

1289
01:24:21,312 --> 01:24:22,928
- But it's not their...
- It's crazy. But it's...

1290
01:24:23,097 --> 01:24:25,530
Um, I mean,
is this weird to you?

1291
01:24:25,632 --> 01:24:26,864
That this person
has taken on--

1292
01:24:26,932 --> 01:24:28,197
it is. Of course, it's weird.

1293
01:24:33,703 --> 01:24:36,003
<i>David: Almost every legal letter
 we'd received from</i>

1294
01:24:36,105 --> 01:24:37,571
<i> from salta was fake.</i>

1295
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:40,473
<i> Like so many things
 connected to d'amato,</i>

1296
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:42,107
<i> they were all just lies,</i>

1297
01:24:42,642 --> 01:24:45,843
<i> lies to support his addiction
 to tickling videos.</i>

1298
01:24:49,248 --> 01:24:52,682
<i> I started this journey curious
 about a bizarre sport</i>

1299
01:24:52,784 --> 01:24:55,117
<i> called competitive
 endurance tickling,</i>

1300
01:24:55,786 --> 01:24:58,953
<i> but I now think this was
 never even about tickling.</i>

1301
01:25:01,924 --> 01:25:05,225
<i> This is about power,
 control and harassment.</i>

1302
01:25:05,727 --> 01:25:07,827
<i> It's about one person's
 twistedness</i>

1303
01:25:07,929 --> 01:25:09,895
<i> and how far that can go.</i>

1304
01:25:09,997 --> 01:25:12,897
<i> One person who's managed to
 shelter himself with money</i>

<i> to keep his obsession going.</i>

1306
01:25:15,901 --> 01:25:18,067
<i> But now it's his life exposed.</i>

1307
01:25:18,402 --> 01:25:21,169
<i> For once, it's him on camera.</i>

<i> Before we leave America,</i>

1309

<i> one of David d'amato's last
 surviving family members.</i>

<i>Dorothy: Hello?</i>

1313
01:25:39,651 --> 01:25:42,518
<i>- Oh, hi. Is that Dorothy?
 - Yes.</i>

1314
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:44,586
Oh, hi. My name's David farrier,

1315
01:25:44,688 --> 01:25:47,655
I'm a journalist from
New Zealand. How are you?

1316
01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:49,656
<i>- Okay.
- Yeah, good.</i>

1317
01:25:49,758 --> 01:25:51,257
Hey, sorry, it's probably a bit
of a strange call

1318
01:25:51,359 --> 01:25:52,424
to receive out of the blue,

1319
01:25:52,659 --> 01:25:57,194
but I'm doing a story about,
uh, David d'amato.

1320
01:25:59,431 --> 01:26:02,731
<i>- Oh, in what way?
- Um...</i>

1321
01:26:03,867 --> 01:26:05,933
He's been... it's the...

1322
01:26:06,101 --> 01:26:08,334
He's sort of back to the
tickling stuff again.

1323
01:26:08,769 --> 01:26:10,034
<i> Oh, he is?</i>

1324
01:26:10,136 --> 01:26:13,369
<i>- Yeah, he is.
 - Oh, god!</i>

1325
01:26:14,538 --> 01:26:16,905
<i> Well, I will tell you that,</i>

1326
01:26:17,007 --> 01:26:20,674
<i> um, I have no contact
 with him at all.</i>

1327
01:26:22,044 --> 01:26:24,677
I mean, did you think all this
had sort of come to an end?

1328
01:26:25,212 --> 01:26:27,278
<i> I did think, of course,
 it came to an end,</i>

1329
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:30,714
<i> because he served time,
 which I'm sure you know.</i>

1330
01:26:30,816 --> 01:26:31,881
Mm.

1331
01:26:31,983 --> 01:26:34,249
<i> But I don't understand, um...</i>

1332
01:26:36,686 --> 01:26:39,619
<i> I don't understand why he
 went back to doing this.</i>

1333
01:26:41,289 --> 01:26:44,689
<i> I'm, like, in shock. How long
 has he been doing this?</i>

1334
01:26:46,526 --> 01:26:48,225
It's never stopped.

1335
01:26:52,864 --> 01:26:55,464
<i> I think he has a
 split personality.</i>

1336
01:26:55,566 --> 01:26:58,966
<i> He's like that fine line
 between genius and insanity.</i>

1337
01:27:01,837 --> 01:27:05,605
<i> I don't know if he's gay
 or he's asexual,</i>

1338
01:27:05,707 --> 01:27:09,107
<i>but he's never had a girlfriend
 that I ever knew of.</i>

1339
01:27:10,743 --> 01:27:13,243
<i> I asked my husband once, um,</i>

1340
01:27:13,345 --> 01:27:16,446
<i> if he would be upset if
 he found out he was gay.</i>

1341
01:27:16,548 --> 01:27:21,217
<i> And he said that he would be
upset but he would get over it.</i>

1342
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:22,951
<i> But he was an only child,</i>

1343
01:27:23,053 --> 01:27:25,886
<i> and, you know, he wanted
 grandchildren.</i>

1344
01:27:28,557 --> 01:27:31,924
<i> He had a very,
 very strange childhood.</i>

1345
01:27:32,893 --> 01:27:37,161
<i> The kids used to make
 fun of him all the time.</i>

1346
01:27:37,329 --> 01:27:39,796
<i> And she used to...
 She... his mother.</i>

1347
01:27:39,898 --> 01:27:42,064
<i> He was very close
 to his mother.</i>

1348
01:27:42,666 --> 01:27:45,133
<i> And his mother was very
 protective of him.</i>

1349
01:27:45,235 --> 01:27:50,471
<i> She never let him ride a bike
 or go skiing or do anything</i>

1350
01:27:50,573 --> 01:27:52,839
<i> because she was always afraid
 that he would get hurt.</i>

1351
01:27:53,741 --> 01:27:55,073
<i> And from what I understand,</i>

1352
01:27:55,175 --> 01:27:56,908
<i> the kids used to come around
 the house,</i>

1353
01:27:57,010 --> 01:27:58,509
<i> and they used to
 make fun of him.</i>

1354
01:27:58,611 --> 01:28:02,145
<i> And once they locked him
 in a locker in school.</i>

1355
01:28:06,084 --> 01:28:07,683
<i> And, you know,
 he was a teacher...</i>

1356
01:28:09,019 --> 01:28:10,852
<i> And they threw him
 out of school.</i>

1357
01:28:11,387 --> 01:28:13,487
<i> You know, I was afraid of him,</i>

1358
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:18,924
<i> because I'm alone and, um...
 Yeah, I was afraid of him.</i>

1359
01:28:19,026 --> 01:28:22,293
<i> So, you know,
 I'm afraid of him.</i>
