00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:32,301
Inspiration of the pet cemetery business...

2
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:36,471
is a little story that probably
leads me back many years.

3
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:42,311
I was born in the state of North Dakota...

4
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:46,315
county of Barnes, city of Valley City.

5
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,652
I was there for several years.

6
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:54,656
Being born in 1930,
then the World War II started...

7
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:58,702
in 1941, when I went to the farm.

8
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:01,872
On the farm, I had my own pet collie...

9
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,458
which worked with me and was beside me.

10
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:08,462
No matter what I did and where I'd go,
my pet collie was with me.

11
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:14,843
One afternoon, we came back
from hauling bundles...

12
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:19,181
"thrashing," the old word's going.

13
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:23,185
And an old Model A came up the road,
struck my collie and killed him.

14
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:27,564
I never did catch him.

15
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,317
But I grabbed my collie...

16
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,820
and held him in my arms until he died.

17
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,824
And I pulled one little acre of land
right behind the house...

18
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,495
I'd say a quarter of a mile away.

19
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:45,499
It overlooked the prairie to the north...

20
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,962
which was really a beautiful"..."
It had a lakeside at the back.

21
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:53,757
I picked that as the cemetery
for my own collie.

22
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:57,719
Right across the street
from where I lived in Los Altos...

23
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,389
was the most beautiful piece of land...

24
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:03,433
as far as I was concerned,
in the whole valley.

25
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,228
And, boy, I knew what to do with it;

26
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,730
make that into a pet cemetery.

27
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,775
I thought, " Well, this is going to be
my project of life. "

28
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:14,236
I found the land, I found the need.

29
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:17,489
Something the old-timers
used to tell me years ago. ;

30
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,493
"To be successful in this world
and life, find a need and fill it. "

31
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:26,915
And, boy, I found a need and I wanted
to fulfill this more than anything.

32
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:31,211
More than anything I did my whole
life, I wanted to fulfill this dream.

33
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:41,513
And there is where we started our work.

34
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:45,517
Planning, development,
and getting the people interested.

35
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,895
Working with"..."

36
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:51,565
I worked with
Carnation Pet Food Company...

37
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:55,444
Safeway Stores, Lucky Stores.

38
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:56,737
Several.

39
00:03:56,737 --> 00:04:00,449
I remember talking with Dicky Euwe...

40
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,992
of Dick's Supermarkets...

41
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:05,621
and asking him if I could come
and work in his pet food section...

42
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:08,916
and just hand out my cards
and talk to the people...

43
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,751
about having a pet cemetery.

44
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:14,755
I went to grooming shops,
I went to veterinarians.

45
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:20,511
And the interest I got was
just phenomenal. It was just great.

46
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:26,016
So then I had to get
some more interested people...

47
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:30,437
in the idea of it,
because we needed the financing.

48
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:36,610
Floyd is a heartwarming individual
who likes to do a lot for everybody.

49
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:40,948
And he came into the office one day,
and him and I got to talking.

50
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:46,370
His real name, I think, is Floyd,
but we always called him Mac.

51
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,290
And Mac, very surprisingly,
said to me that...

52
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,294
something he had always wanted to do
was put a pet cemetery together.

53
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,673
So I said, "Mac, that's amazing...

54
00:04:57,673 --> 00:05:01,677
"because we've just been thinking
about the same thing ourselves...

55
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:06,557
"and maybe we can put it together
under one group."

56
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:08,809
So he said, "Wonderful."

57
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,061
So I was made aware of this property...

58
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:14,773
that is in Los Altos
on Foothill and Highway 280.

59
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:18,777
We felt that it would make
a great place for a pet cemetery...

60
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,323
because it had tremendous visual ability...

61
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:27,870
and thousands of cars that went past 280.

62
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,373
And the property leaned
in other directions as well.

63
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:35,377
It was a marvelous location
for a restaurant or a motel.

64
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,839
Various and sundry things.

65
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,843
We found that people by the name
of Dunton owned the property...

66
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:47,431
and we approached them
and asked them what they thought.

67
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:50,350
There was a meeting
held at Mr. McClure's house...

68
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,478
which I attended.

69
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:57,482
I was a little late, but during the meeting...

70
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:02,070
Mr. Dunton had expressed
his wishes, desires, and needs...

71
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:06,658
to Mr. McClure,
and emphasizing very strongly:

72
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,370
"Mac, you have nothing to worry about.

73
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,374
"I'm a minister of this particular church.

74
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,004
"You can trust me. I'm a minister.

75
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:23,091
"We will have a pet cemetery.
It will be a success.

76
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,677
"You and I, we'll put it together.

77
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:28,931
"We'll do it. We'll have it. Just you and I."

78
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:32,726
It was sort of a kismet idea.

79
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:36,730
So we went to work on the pet cemetery.

80
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,818
The ugly crisis...

81
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,781
which we used as our basis...

82
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,786
and this was nothing against
the SPCA of Santa Clara County...

83
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:54,790
or the Animal Control Officer
of Santa Clara County.

84
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,795
But the idea that we needed the concept...

85
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:07,052
for the people that loved their pets,
and needed a place for them.

86
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:11,598
Not the garbage pit, not the garbage can...

87
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,101
and a place to bulldoze them
into the ground...

88
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:18,105
because we have more love and desire
for Mother Nature's little pets.

89
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:21,775
God only gave us these pets...

90
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,779
to be our fellowship, desire, and will.

91
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:30,158
And what have we got
to give them in return?

92
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:34,162
Not to be put into a garbage pail
or a dump ground...

93
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:39,960
but our last goodbye for the things
they gave us.

94
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:47,176
Rendering is an old industry. It dates
back to the time of the Egyptians.

95
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,554
They can trace it back this far, rendering.

96
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:53,682
In the Bible,
way back in the Old Testament...

97
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:57,227
the guy cut off the sheepskin
and put it over him...

98
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:00,147
and put the lamb fat on him
to keep him warm.

99
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:04,151
It could be the oldest industry
in the world. It could be. It's possible.

100
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,780
When the public got concerned
about recycling...

101
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,784
that's when the rendering industry
started to blossom out, so to speak.

102
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:17,789
And say, "Hey, we've been recycling
for 500 years here.

103
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:21,043
"Take a look at us. We are recycling.

104
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:23,754
"We're doing
what everybody wants us to do."

105
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,797
And that's when we started to come forward.

106
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:29,092
Before that, nobody talked about
the rendering industry.

107
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:32,971
That's why it was the invisible industry.
Nobody ever mentioned it.

108
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:35,807
On the quiet side,
what those guys do out there is...

109
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:39,645
they boil all this stuff in pots.

110
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:41,104
Stinks.

111
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:45,108
What is a rendering company?

112
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:50,989
My mind pretty near exploded
with the thought and the memories...

113
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:56,161
of a very bad nightmare.

114
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:59,122
A dream of hell.

115
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:03,001
And it took me back to this
rendering company in North Dakota...

116
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:07,005
where all the little pets at that time,
when they died, were"..."

117
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,633
A truck would come out...

118
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:12,010
and a big old driver
would come and grab your pet...

119
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,346
and throw him in the back end
of this old truck...

120
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:17,140
and take him to what I called
"the boiler chambers."

121
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,686
It's controversial. In other words...

122
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,855
we stay low-key.

123
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:25,732
We don't want people to know
we're bringing in animals...

124
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:29,027
and reprocessing animal byproducts.

125
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:32,281
Some people get nauseated by the thought.

126
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:35,993
They get nauseated by it, you know that?

127
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:39,621
I've had people ask me"..."

128
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:43,625
I've been at a dinner party,
been sitting down at a dinner table.

129
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:46,336
And somebody will say, "What do you do?"

130
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,964
And I say, "Hey, I'm in the tallow business."

131
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,591
And somebody will say:

132
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:54,595
"Don't bring that up right now.
Wait until after when we all break up."

133
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:58,223
In other words, "We don't want to talk
about what you do, Mike.

134
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:02,019
"It makes us sick."
Why, I don't know. But it does.

135
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:05,314
People say that all the time.

136
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:09,318
We called it back home "a glue
factory." They don't waste nothing.

137
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:13,947
They take the meat and strip it.
They take the bones...

138
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:18,160
and boil them, cook them, and
make some kind of meal out of them.

139
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:22,164
And they don't waste nothing, not even
the toenails on the animal or anything.

140
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:26,710
And the smell that came from it.

141
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,714
I walked in there one day as a child,
and saw all these animals laying there.

142
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:35,636
Being a 4-H man and an animal lover...

143
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,679
I just thought:

144
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,683
"Boy, being in hell, here I am.
I'm sitting on the floors of hell now."

145
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:47,147
Mike furnished the car, the station wagon.

146
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:51,151
And Mac furnished some furniture,
his time, and his promotion skills.

147
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:56,782
And Joe, also furniture and some labor.

148
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:01,912
We both dug the first few graves.

149
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:04,373
And I made some of the caskets...

150
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:06,875
and Joe would also go around
and pick them up.

151
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:10,879
He'd go around and pick up the pets
to be prepared.

152
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,843
Burying the pets was a very difficult task.

153
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:21,181
Mr. McClure was physically handicapped.

154
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:26,103
He couldn't in no way do
any physical labor whatsoever.

155
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:31,191
My having full-time employment...

156
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,318
was mostly done in the evening.

157
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,280
A gentleman came to my door.

158
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,284
And the gentleman was a huge man.
I'd say about 6'2".

159
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,874
Large.

160
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,003
He's more the Hercules type.

161
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:55,007
He asked me, "Are you Floyd
McClure?" And I said, "Yes, sir."

162
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:58,802
He said, "Do you have
the pet cemetery across the street?"

163
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:02,764
My house was right across the street
from the cemetery.

164
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:04,933
I said, "Yes, sir."

165
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:08,937
And he started crying.

166
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:13,150
I asked him, "What's wrong?"
He said, "Last night my dog died."

167
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,489
He says, "I want to bury him this morning."

168
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:23,452
And his family was home,
and they were going to go to church.

169
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:27,956
But he had him completely wrapped.

170
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:31,001
Like a mummy, pretty near.

171
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:35,005
I would then get the pet out of his car...

172
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:40,219
lay him out in the driveway,
and proceed to clean him up...

173
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:46,016
brush him out, make him
as presentable as possible.

174
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:50,020
We had all kinds of animals.
I mean, every type of animal.

175
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,024
We had snakes, rats, monkeys, chickens...

176
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:58,362
hamsters, mice. Seen a few.

177
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,364
Rodents of all types.

178
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:04,326
And we had, of course, dogs.

179
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:08,372
Cats were our main pets.

180
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:12,376
But it doesn't make any difference
what type of animal.

181
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,213
You love it.

182
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:19,132
And you want to give it a proper burial.

183
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,219
That's your business.
You bury that pet because you love it.

184
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:25,305
You could have...

185
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,558
the idea that all animals should be buried.

186
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:31,395
But if you live over here,
or 5 or 10 miles away...

187
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:34,898
and you have a horse,
and that horse dies on a Saturday...

188
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,901
and it's 102 degrees,
and you can't get anybody to bury it...

189
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:41,154
you're going to get a hold
of the rendering company real fast.

190
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:45,158
Because you want that horse
out of there, like, now. See?

191
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,164
I remember one young lad there that"..."

192
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:53,250
He had a pet lamb.

193
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,129
And his lamb died, and right away,
his dad picked up the phone.

194
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:59,923
This is a 4-H animal...

195
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:03,594
that he had taken from birth,
and he just loved this animal.

196
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:07,598
And right away,
his father had grabbed the phone"..."

197
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,268
And back in North Dakota,
very few people had phones.

198
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,353
But at this particular farm,
they had a phone.

199
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:17,024
He called the rendering service
outside of Valley City...

200
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:19,443
and asked them
to come and pick up the animal.

201
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:23,071
I've had people call who have an animal...

202
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,573
and they want us to bury it.

203
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:28,535
We don't bury animals, and they're
crying. People are very emotional.

204
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,121
That's why it's a controversial thing.

205
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:35,125
That's why I don't like to break away
and get into the individual thing.

206
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:38,086
You take a guy who loses his pet horse.

207
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:41,298
I mean, to some people, you know...

208
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:44,218
it's like losing their son or their daughter.

209
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:46,386
I mean it. That's no kidding.

210
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,973
They're really chilled up bad. It's heavy.

211
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:53,977
You know, you get some real moaners
on the phone, and they're crying.

212
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:57,314
This young lad, he was so upset...

213
00:14:57,314 --> 00:15:01,318
he went out and jumped on his pony
and rode clear over to our place...

214
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,240
and told me that his pet had died...

215
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,244
and wanted to know if he could bury
his pet with my collie out there.

216
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:12,996
I said, "Sure."

217
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,998
So we hooked up a team of horses...

218
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:18,001
and we headed out to his place
to beat the rendering truck.

219
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:22,005
And we did. We got there
and got the pet on the wagon...

220
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:26,218
and got him back over to the farm.

221
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:31,306
I guess we beat the rendering truck
by about two hours or something.

222
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:35,310
We had a little altar set up in the office
with some artificial flowers.

223
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,939
And Mr. McClure would light the candles...

224
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:41,024
and be ready to receive...

225
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:45,028
the mourning owners of the pets.

226
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:48,198
The mother was uptown shopping...

227
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:51,118
and the kids were home.

228
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,203
I'm not talking about small children.

229
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:57,040
I'm talking about kids
that are teenage children.

230
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,335
And the mother gave them
specific chores to do.

231
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:04,339
One was, the girl was
to wash and dry the clothes.

232
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:05,549
One was to wash...

233
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:08,552
and the other was to take the clothes
and put it in the dryer.

234
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:11,471
So anyway, the job was done.

235
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:15,475
The girl threw the clothes in the dryer
and slammed the dryer door shut...

236
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:19,021
and walked back to the kitchen.

237
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:21,732
As I understand this now...

238
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:25,694
she heard some meowing
and frightened screams of the cat.

239
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:30,240
They were looking for the cat
and couldn't find the cat.

240
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,410
All of a sudden...

241
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,288
they heard it in the dryer.

242
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:40,292
They opened the dryer door up,
and the cat was in the dryer.

243
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:43,545
The little cat suffered a broken neck.

244
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:47,508
I guess they called out the fire
department and tried to revive the cat.

245
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:51,637
But the cat did pass on.

246
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:53,347
The love...

247
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:57,351
that people have for their pets
is really tremendous.

248
00:16:57,518 --> 00:17:01,522
It's something that is very difficult
to explain.

249
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:05,817
On several occasions, I've seen it myself...

250
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,694
where we were burying a pet...

251
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:11,281
the whole cemetery
would be at the grave site...

252
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:14,451
the children...

253
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:18,455
the mother, and the father
would really break down...

254
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:22,626
and actually cry.

255
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:26,588
The little services that we give
out there at the cemetery...

256
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:31,051
we bring out pretty much that:

257
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,804
"Here before us lies little Toby.

258
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:37,766
"Little Toby was put on this Earth
for two reasons: To love and be loved.

259
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:43,355
"And today, we're standing here
saying goodbye to little Toby...

260
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:48,068
"who was the Smiths' beloved little friend.

261
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:52,531
"Now, we're going to give you back,
little Toby, to Mother Nature."

262
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:58,203
We had a gal here. I had a gal hired here.

263
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,123
Now, this will show you
what you're up against.

264
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,834
She never went in the plant,
she never left this office.

265
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,170
You don't see anything of this plant.

266
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:10,174
These trucks.
You don't see too much, right?

267
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:11,717
And she didn't see anything.

268
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:15,095
But she left. She quit working here...

269
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,431
because it bothered her mind.

270
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:20,267
The mere fact of what we did
bothered her mind.

271
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:23,645
And she never saw a damn thing
or smelled anything.

272
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:27,357
One thing that really bothered me a lot...

273
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:30,652
that really got into my heart...

274
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:34,156
was knowing, not only that animals...

275
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:38,160
are being treated in such a violent way
after death...

276
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,871
in this rendering company...

277
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:42,581
by being torn apart...

278
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:46,585
and every scrap of their body
being used in one way or another.

279
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,588
But the smell and stuff was so terrific...

280
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:53,592
we'd even sit down in the evening time
to our meal...

281
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:57,304
and the only thing that hit your nostrils...

282
00:18:57,304 --> 00:19:01,308
wasrt that good piece of meat
you were about to eat...

283
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:05,270
or the vegetable...

284
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,898
or the nice dessert that's put on your table.

285
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:11,902
But you first had to grab the
wine glass and take a whiff of that.

286
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:16,573
Get the smell of the rendering
company out of your nostrils.

287
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:20,536
You know John Ascuaga's Nugget up there?

288
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:24,540
They lost one of those elephants once.
Didrt know what the hell to do with it.

289
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:28,585
We got it.
And somebody made the statement:

290
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,754
"Hey, that thing went
to the rendering company."

291
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:32,589
We had so many phone calls...

292
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:35,551
and we actually had to deny
that we had that animal.

293
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:39,263
We told them we took it out
to a pet cemetery and buried it.

294
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:42,558
Because people just didn't want
to get"..." People got chilled up.

295
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:45,602
What happened to that animal?
What happened to that elephant?

296
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:49,565
Where's the elephant? Every once in a
while, they'll lose a giraffe at the zoo...

297
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:54,194
or they'll lose Big Bertha,
or Joe Bear or whatever his name is.

298
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,740
And I mean, people say,
"Hey, what's going on here?"

299
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,703
We better bury this
and get a plot and everything.

300
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,914
So we have a standing deal with the zoo.

301
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:08,792
They don't tell them where the animal went.

302
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:11,587
Because they don't want to be
in the burying business.

303
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:15,591
When I came here,
and seen this ugly crisis...

304
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:19,720
these gas chambers
that they got built down here...

305
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:23,348
and these pets half-dead
going into the dump grounds...

306
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,642
and the bulldozer
going over the top of them...

307
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:28,645
and leaving them half alive
in the garbage dumps...

308
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:32,316
brought me back to that, and I
thought, "We're going to beat this."

309
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:35,444
And this is part of the inspiration...

310
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:37,779
of getting our little pets...

311
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:41,742
out of these places and into a cemetery.

312
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:45,871
Something that
we could be proud of saying:

313
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:50,417
"My little pet has done his chore here.

314
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:54,421
"That God has sent him to us to do
a chore: Love and be loved...

315
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:58,592
"and serve his master." And, boy,
these little pets have done that.

316
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:02,638
And not let them go into the bases
of the living hell.

317
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:07,267
Like I said before, "Death is for
the living and not for the dead."

318
00:21:11,522 --> 00:21:15,484
Sing, baby.

319
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:17,694
Come on.

320
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,821
I want my mama.

321
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:23,784
Oh, so sleepy.

322
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:39,716
Attaboy.

323
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:43,679
I want my mama.

324
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,684
Are you sleepy? We'll sing loud.

325
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:57,860
How can I say how you miss them.

326
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:01,822
And how you wake at night
and feel around for her...

327
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:06,910
hoping that's she's all right,
and then she's not even there.

328
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,124
It's heartbreaking. And then
you remember that she's gone.

329
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:15,586
You get to thinking where she is.

330
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:17,921
You know where she is
and you're happy where she is.

331
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:21,633
The next day you go out and take
flowers, maybe meditate a little bit...

332
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:25,637
and think of how often
maybe you cried into her fur.

333
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:30,392
People like people
because they like one another.

334
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:33,020
And people don't trust
one another thoroughly...

335
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,732
like an animal and a human being.

336
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:40,110
I can know you very well.

337
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:43,071
But when I turn my back, I don't know you.

338
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:44,573
Not truly.

339
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:46,700
But my little dog...

340
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,994
I can turn my back on my little dog...

341
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:51,872
and I know he's back there.
He's my little friend.

342
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:55,876
He's not gonna jump on me or bite me
or anything like that.

343
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:58,962
But human beings cannot be this way.

344
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:02,925
We didn't get an agreement,
which is our fault, in writing.

345
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:08,388
And it just kept getting involved
and more involved.

346
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:14,061
And since there was no
final agreement, then we started...

347
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:19,900
to differ on ideas,
and get into a few arguments.

348
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:23,987
A pet cemetery business
is not a fast-buck scheme.

349
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,989
It's not a suede-shoe game.

350
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:29,952
It's a good, solid business enterprise.

351
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:34,581
And in order to have this concept...

352
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:38,418
it has to be in your heart
and not in your billfold.

353
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:42,089
And these are the type of people
I wanted in business with me...

354
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:46,093
in the pet cemetery concept.

355
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:50,931
The reason, unfortunately,
why we didn't continue on...

356
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:55,435
with the entire development
of the pet cemetery was...

357
00:23:56,103 --> 00:24:00,107
we couldn't actually work it out
with our investors...

358
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:04,945
that we could project exactly
what the income would be for it.

359
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:08,198
Because we had no way of projecting
the amount of people...

360
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:11,201
that would want to put their pets
into a cemetery...

361
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:14,705
even though we felt
that there was a great need for it.

362
00:24:14,705 --> 00:24:18,709
So after several weeks
and several months, we decided...

363
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:24,548
it would be better to turn it back
to the original owners...

364
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:27,634
which was Mr. Dunton and his family.

365
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:29,011
I was told...

366
00:24:29,011 --> 00:24:32,973
that Duntons trying to get themselves
involved in some sort of gold venture...

367
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:39,479
or exporting of dead animals
from the United States to Mexico...

368
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:41,481
for some university in Mexico...

369
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:45,485
to do some exploration type of work
on the animals.

370
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:51,158
Mr. Robert Dunton
had convinced Mrs. Ken Dunton...

371
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:55,162
to have her child born in Mexico,
so he would be a Mexican citizen.

372
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:57,539
And under those pretences...

373
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:01,502
he could have a business in Mexico
and control it.

374
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:05,088
Mr. Dunton came back into town...

375
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:09,092
and he decided at that time that"..."

376
00:25:09,218 --> 00:25:13,180
Well, maybe, this is just a great thing.
I can't speak for this mars mind.

377
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:17,851
But the only thing I thought at the time
was the way they decided...

378
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,523
I should open one grave site, put
several pets into one grave, close it.

379
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:27,611
To me, that only spelled one thing:

380
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:31,573
"Let's get all the bucks we can out of this."

381
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:40,791
Mac called me and says:

382
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:44,795
"Well, we can't come to a final
agreement, and I got put out today."

383
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:47,548
He says:

384
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:51,552
"The attorney's advice would be to get
all those pets over on the legal side...

385
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:54,721
"and vamoose."

386
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:58,725
So that's what we did.

387
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:34,052
Mrs. Billingsley came out to the cemetery...

388
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:38,056
and said that they had
moved the stone on her animal.

389
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:41,685
And I said, "How are they gonna to get
the animal out of the grave...

390
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:45,355
"the casket out,
if they don't move the stone?"

391
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:47,858
And she said
she didn't want her animal moved.

392
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:51,820
She said, "You talk as if I didn't care
about my animals."

393
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:56,366
And I said, "Well, that's the way
it appears to me."

394
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:24,937
I asked her if she'd signed a release,
and she said she had.

395
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:30,275
Then she said she hadrt.
So I don't know. I can't swear to that.

396
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:34,321
But I made up my mind
I wasrt going to fool with her.

397
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:38,325
She went down
and talked to Mr. Robert Dunton...

398
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:41,954
and I sat in the car waiting for his son.

399
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:45,123
I was supposed to sign the release
to let my dog go.

400
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:49,127
And then I saw both of them look
in my direction and start laughing...

401
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:51,296
like it was just a big joke.

402
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:53,257
She isn't going to cause me any trouble...

403
00:27:53,257 --> 00:27:55,759
because I'm not going
to pay any attention to her.

404
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:58,971
She just wanted to be noticed.
She just wanted to be Miss Big.

405
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:02,933
And here we have all of these other
poor people that really needed help...

406
00:28:02,933 --> 00:28:04,935
and she was just trying to be Miss Big...

407
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:08,939
and she didn't pay half as much
as the rest of us did.

408
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:23,745
I don't know whether she really
liked her animals or loved them...

409
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:28,041
or whether she was just trying
to show off, make a big impression.

410
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:29,751
This was my idea...

411
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:33,005
because anybody that would come
whizzing up in a Cadillac...

412
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:35,507
with all of her furs on, to a cemetery...

413
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:38,969
and you know when they're digging
animals, there's gonna be an odor...

414
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:41,180
didn't have much upstairs.

415
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,474
Because, I'll tell you,
that was not the place to wear fur.

416
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:48,437
I think that something should be done
so that it shall never happen again.

417
00:28:50,856 --> 00:28:54,860
I think it was a horrible thing for us
in this generation to have it happen.

418
00:28:54,985 --> 00:28:57,529
And in a state like California...

419
00:28:57,529 --> 00:29:01,533
to have something like that,
I think it's inumane.

420
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:14,004
I think Mac really wanted a pet cemetery...

421
00:29:14,004 --> 00:29:17,799
and I think he probably had
a great love for animals.

422
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,259
Unfortunately, it's not that easy.

423
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:23,263
You can't just go out and start
something like that, build a chapel...

424
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:28,519
and pay $50,000 an acre for land...

425
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:32,481
and pay taxes, interest on the balance...

426
00:29:33,357 --> 00:29:35,901
for 25 cents.

427
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:38,362
Impossible.

428
00:29:38,362 --> 00:29:40,322
And the Duntons were not interested...

429
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:44,284
in that beautiful Garden of Eden
that Mac had in his mind.

430
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:48,038
Because I really think he had it in his mind.

431
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:50,374
So as a total...

432
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:54,378
before it finally wound up
and went to the final lawsuit...

433
00:29:55,045 --> 00:29:59,007
I myself lost around $30,000.
I'm not sure how much Joe has lost.

434
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:06,098
It's in that neighborhood.

435
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:11,061
I suppose after you lose
this kind of money...

436
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:15,023
you just keep working at it until
you're a success at something.

437
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:25,159
The only thing that I'm guilty of
is compassion.

438
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:28,120
And that's all.

439
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,414
If you want to put...

440
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:34,418
to what I was charged with...

441
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:37,462
in the courts...

442
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:41,466
the only thing they can charge me with
is compassion.

443
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:45,470
Because I put my heart over the dollar sign.

444
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:50,934
It wasrt the dollar I was after.

445
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:53,103
It was to take care of my customers...

446
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:57,065
and my dedication to what I believed in.

447
00:30:57,983 --> 00:31:01,987
Then, because of the way
I proved my point...

448
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:06,325
by using my heart...

449
00:31:06,617 --> 00:31:10,370
into fulfilling my obligation...

450
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:13,665
then I was condemned.

451
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:17,294
Then they write letters...

452
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:21,298
telling everybody I'm no longer part of it...

453
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:26,220
which broke me...

454
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,389
not only financially...

455
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:33,018
a burden upon myself and everyone else"..."

456
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:37,022
I was not only broke...

457
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:42,319
but broken-heart.

458
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:52,162
I was raised on a farm...

459
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:56,166
where we had chickens, pigs,
cows, sheep, and everything.

460
00:31:57,251 --> 00:32:00,170
But down here I've been lost.

461
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:03,340
Now they're taking them all
away from here up to the"..."

462
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,177
What's the name of that place
that's up above here a little ways?

463
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:09,429
That town?

464
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:13,016
Commences with "B."

465
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:16,979
It's Blue Hill Cemetery,
I think the name of it is.

466
00:32:20,357 --> 00:32:24,361
Not too far, I guess about maybe
20 miles from here.

467
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:28,615
A little town there, a little place.
You know where it's at.

468
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,163
But I was really surprised...

469
00:32:34,163 --> 00:32:37,332
when I heard they were
getting rid of the cemetery over here.

470
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:41,295
They're putting buildings
or something over there.

471
00:32:42,087 --> 00:32:46,091
I know people
have been very good to me, you know.

472
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:51,471
Well, they see my condition, I guess,
and felt sorry for me.

473
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:55,475
But it's real my condition is.
It's not put on, that's for sure.

474
00:32:55,726 --> 00:32:59,271
Boy, if I could only walk,
if I could only get out...

475
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:01,607
drive my car"..."

476
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:04,401
I'd get another car.

477
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:08,363
Yeah. My son, if he was only better to me.

478
00:33:08,447 --> 00:33:12,451
After I bought him that car"..."
He's got a nice car.

479
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:16,288
I bought it myself just a short time ago.

480
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:20,167
I don't know. These kids...

481
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:21,585
the more you do for them"..."

482
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:25,589
He's my grandson,
but I raised him from 2 years old.

483
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:27,758
And my husband always told me...

484
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:31,762
he says, "Mama,
someday you're going to be sorry."

485
00:33:33,472 --> 00:33:36,517
That was a car?

486
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:37,601
Oh, boy.

487
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:40,604
He said,
"Someday you're going to be sorry."

488
00:33:40,604 --> 00:33:44,608
You see how it happens, things?

489
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:47,778
I don't see him very often.

490
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:51,490
And he just got the car.

491
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:54,743
I didn't pay for all of it. I gave him $400.

492
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:57,287
Pretty good. His boss knows it.

493
00:33:57,287 --> 00:34:00,833
He's not working for that outfit now.
He's changed.

494
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:04,837
He's gone back on his old job,
hauling sand.

495
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:09,633
No, not hauling sand.
He's working in the office. That's right.

496
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:13,595
He took over the office job.
His boss told me that on the phone.

497
00:34:14,638 --> 00:34:17,516
But, you know, he should help me more.

498
00:34:17,516 --> 00:34:21,436
He's all I got.
He's the one who brought me up here.

499
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:25,315
And then put me here by myself
among strangers.

500
00:34:25,315 --> 00:34:27,860
It's terrible, if you stop and think of it.

501
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:31,864
I've been without so much
when I first came up here.

502
00:34:39,371 --> 00:34:43,375
Half of my trouble
is from him not being home with me.

503
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:48,589
Didrt cost him nothing to stay here.

504
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:51,175
Every time he needed money,
he'd always come:

505
00:34:51,175 --> 00:34:54,803
"Mom, can I have this? Can I have that?"

506
00:34:54,803 --> 00:34:57,431
But he never pays it back.

507
00:34:57,431 --> 00:35:00,517
"Too good, too easy."
That's what everybody tells me.

508
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:04,521
I quit now. I quit.

509
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:08,567
Now he's got the office job,
I'm going after him.

510
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:11,195
I'm going after him good, too.

511
00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:14,364
If I have to...

512
00:35:14,364 --> 00:35:17,159
do it in a different way.

513
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:20,621
He's going to pay that money.
He's got the office job now.

514
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:23,832
He makes good money anyway.

515
00:35:23,832 --> 00:35:27,669
And he has no kids. He's not married.
"Never get married," he says.

516
00:35:27,669 --> 00:35:31,632
He was married once. They're divorced.

517
00:35:32,883 --> 00:35:36,512
Well, she tried to take him for the kid,
but she didn't.

518
00:35:36,512 --> 00:35:40,474
They went to court.
It was somebody else's kid.

519
00:35:40,641 --> 00:35:44,645
She was nothing but a tramp.
I told him that. He wouldn't listen.

520
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:49,149
I said, "I know what she is.
Richard, please, listen to me."

521
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:52,778
No, he wouldn't listen.
He knew it all. He knew everything.

522
00:35:52,778 --> 00:35:54,571
Big shot.

523
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:57,282
But he soon found out.

524
00:35:57,282 --> 00:35:59,910
Now that's all over with.

525
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:03,539
I've been through so much,
I don't know how I'm staying alive.

526
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:06,750
Really, for my age"..."

527
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,877
If you're young, it's different.

528
00:36:08,877 --> 00:36:12,548
But I've always said,
"I'm never going to grow old."

529
00:36:12,548 --> 00:36:14,216
I've always had that.

530
00:36:14,216 --> 00:36:18,178
And people that I tell how old I am,
they don't believe me.

531
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:22,724
Because people my age, as a I rule,
don't get around like I do.

532
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,444
Skippy's been dead quite awhile,
two or three years.

533
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,659
I don't want to think about it.

534
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:44,663
Everybody liked that dog around here.

535
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:50,502
You know, you miss your pets
just like you do any of the family.

536
00:36:52,588 --> 00:36:56,216
And I don't know what happened
to this last little kitty who was here.

537
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:58,635
Now all the cats have gone.

538
00:36:58,635 --> 00:37:02,598
There's no cats around,
no animals, no nothing.

539
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:06,643
I miss that little black kitten so much.

540
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:09,313
It was wonderful.

541
00:37:09,313 --> 00:37:13,317
And all of a sudden, boom.
No animals around.

542
00:37:13,817 --> 00:37:17,779
Somebody in the neighborhood
or something is doing away with them.

543
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,792
The thought of trying to bury 400 pets...

544
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:34,338
was pretty hard to accept at the outset.

545
00:37:34,338 --> 00:37:38,342
However, we felt that we had
an obligation to pet owners...

546
00:37:38,342 --> 00:37:41,261
because if we were not to take on
this endeavor...

547
00:37:41,261 --> 00:37:44,306
it would leave many pet owners
with a sour taste...

548
00:37:44,306 --> 00:37:48,268
and could set our industry back
for a long time.

549
00:37:48,352 --> 00:37:49,478
We are often asked. ;

550
00:37:49,478 --> 00:37:53,440
"Why is your business apparently
successful where others have failed?"

551
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:58,612
The only answer that I can give
is a very obvious one and that is. ;

552
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:03,951
We have tried to follow
sound business practices...

553
00:38:04,326 --> 00:38:07,496
where it's quite obvious
that other pet cemeteries...

554
00:38:07,496 --> 00:38:10,541
that have now failed, did not.

555
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:13,794
This cemetery will be in business...

556
00:38:13,794 --> 00:38:16,922
50, 60, 70, or 100 years from now.

557
00:38:16,922 --> 00:38:20,342
Certainly beyond the lifetime of anybody...

558
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:22,886
who ever buried a pet here.

559
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:26,849
I think this is all that concerns people
that have buried their pets here.

560
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,520
When we decided...

561
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,064
to turn the property into a pet cemetery...

562
00:38:34,064 --> 00:38:37,818
and we discussed a name...

563
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:41,405
we just all agreed that we couldn't
come up with a better one...

564
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:45,409
than Bubbling Well Pet Memorial Park,
which has a lovely sound.

565
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:50,539
The connotation
is something living, bubbling.

566
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:54,501
A well with lovely, refreshing spring water.

567
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:58,755
And it has a meaning of life...

568
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:02,426
and purity...

569
00:39:02,426 --> 00:39:06,430
and all of the good things
that we all like to think about.

570
00:39:07,431 --> 00:39:11,393
Most people don't know it, but we're
in the middle of a pet explosion...

571
00:39:12,436 --> 00:39:15,606
throughout not only the United States,
but throughout the world.

572
00:39:15,606 --> 00:39:17,733
And this has been brought about...

573
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:21,695
from the new pattern that has
emerged in the last 10-15 years...

574
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:25,365
in the family life.

575
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:29,369
I would say that the pill
is largely more responsible...

576
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:33,624
for the pet explosion
than any other single factor.

577
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:36,376
This is quite a surprise...

578
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:39,087
to a lot of people
that don't understand the business...

579
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:42,633
and haven't done any background work.

580
00:39:42,633 --> 00:39:45,135
But it's very simple.

581
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:49,139
The old style was for the husband
to earn the living...

582
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:51,642
and the mother stayed at home.

583
00:39:51,642 --> 00:39:55,646
Today, we have a different pattern.
Today, husband and wife both work.

584
00:39:56,438 --> 00:39:58,106
And they want to prepare themselves...

585
00:39:58,106 --> 00:40:01,610
with a home and some of the things
they would like to have...

586
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:04,446
before they start a family.

587
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:07,783
Well, this is just fine
from a planning standpoint.

588
00:40:07,783 --> 00:40:10,953
But nature can't be put aside.

589
00:40:10,953 --> 00:40:14,915
When the young mother comes home,
she has to have something to fondle.

590
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:18,752
Something to mother, something to love.

591
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:21,088
She'll have a pet.

592
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:24,216
The rest of it, in the normal pattern...

593
00:40:24,216 --> 00:40:28,220
would be that the grandparents...

594
00:40:28,846 --> 00:40:30,973
would have children.

595
00:40:30,973 --> 00:40:32,766
Grandchildren...

596
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:36,728
to take care of, to fondle,
and to help to rear.

597
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:40,732
This would satisfy their need for love
and giving of love and receiving.

598
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:45,154
But when this has been set aside
for five, six, seven, or eight years...

599
00:40:45,154 --> 00:40:47,823
what do they do? They get a pet.

600
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:50,159
Now we're talking about
both sides of the family.

601
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:51,952
We are not talking about just one.

602
00:40:51,952 --> 00:40:55,038
Now we have a three-way explosion.

603
00:40:55,038 --> 00:40:57,833
Well, we're here...

604
00:40:57,833 --> 00:41:00,836
to put Caesar in the ground today.

605
00:41:00,836 --> 00:41:04,798
I know this is something
that you've not looked forward to...

606
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,885
but I would just be interested to know...

607
00:41:07,885 --> 00:41:11,513
how you picked Bubbling Well.

608
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:15,475
And just tell us a little about Caesar...

609
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:19,688
so we can have as much personal
feeling about this as you do...

610
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:23,484
because we're going to be
Caesar's caretakers...

611
00:41:23,484 --> 00:41:25,903
and take care of his plot from now on.

612
00:41:25,903 --> 00:41:28,572
And although we can't know...

613
00:41:28,572 --> 00:41:32,576
personal details about all the pets of
all who come to Bubbling Well...

614
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:36,830
we have a great feeling for pets...

615
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:40,834
and we certainly want to include
Caesar in our pet family.

616
00:41:41,293 --> 00:41:45,297
Cal, here's a little picture of Caesar.

617
00:41:46,173 --> 00:41:47,925
If you see that, you can understand...

618
00:41:47,925 --> 00:41:51,678
why we wanted him buried in a good
place like Bubbling Wells here.

619
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:53,514
You know, I feel like I know him.

620
00:41:53,514 --> 00:41:56,808
- Is that right?
- That face and that smile.

621
00:41:56,808 --> 00:41:58,685
He was quite some dog.

622
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:01,188
And what was his pedigree again?

623
00:42:01,188 --> 00:42:04,942
He was a mixture
of Australian sheep and terrier.

624
00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:06,860
- And terrier?
- Yeah.

625
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,279
You can see with all that hair he had.

626
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,073
Did he have a coat.

627
00:42:11,073 --> 00:42:13,116
- And look at that face.
- Isn't he beautiful?

628
00:42:13,116 --> 00:42:16,245
I've never seen that kind of a mix.

629
00:42:16,245 --> 00:42:19,623
And we get many different combinations.

630
00:42:19,623 --> 00:42:22,209
One thing that we get and we see...

631
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:26,213
is it's the combinations, it's the
crossbreed that produce seemingly...

632
00:42:27,631 --> 00:42:29,299
- the best pet.
- Right.

633
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:31,635
The purebreds are fine...

634
00:42:31,635 --> 00:42:35,597
and a lot of people enjoy their relationship...

635
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:39,893
as much as others.
But it seems that when we get a mix...

636
00:42:41,937 --> 00:42:45,858
somehow it seems to bring out
the best in all the breeds.

637
00:42:45,858 --> 00:42:47,609
- And they make a better pet.
- Right.

638
00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:50,821
I don't know. This is most unusual.

639
00:42:50,821 --> 00:42:52,739
Most unusual.

640
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:56,243
I just can say
I've never seen anything like that.

641
00:42:56,243 --> 00:43:00,247
- He always had hair over his eyes.
- That's from the sheep in him.

642
00:43:02,749 --> 00:43:04,334
He never had any trouble looking out?

643
00:43:04,334 --> 00:43:07,588
- No, he found his way around good.
- He got around.

644
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:11,008
- I'm glad you showed that to me.
- He always got around me pretty nice.

645
00:43:11,008 --> 00:43:14,970
I bet he did.

646
00:43:15,095 --> 00:43:18,265
Our oldest son,
who was in the insurance business...

647
00:43:18,265 --> 00:43:20,392
back in Salt Lake City...

648
00:43:20,392 --> 00:43:24,396
decided that insurance business
pressures were getting to him...

649
00:43:24,855 --> 00:43:28,108
and he made a trip back home...

650
00:43:28,108 --> 00:43:32,112
just to look around the Bay Area
to see what might be available.

651
00:43:34,364 --> 00:43:38,285
His mother, as devious as she is...

652
00:43:38,285 --> 00:43:42,289
got him on the hill
and really sold him a bill of goods.

653
00:43:42,873 --> 00:43:45,042
And the next thing we knew...

654
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:49,004
he had decided to bring
his little family back to Napa.

655
00:43:58,388 --> 00:44:01,225
Every young guy has an aspiration...

656
00:44:01,225 --> 00:44:05,187
to pursue a very aggressive sales field.

657
00:44:06,772 --> 00:44:10,234
About the only thing
I could think about was insurance.

658
00:44:10,234 --> 00:44:14,238
I started off as a salesman, worked
my way up to a sales manager.

659
00:44:15,864 --> 00:44:18,992
But throughout the whole thing...
I wasrt cognizant of it...

660
00:44:18,992 --> 00:44:22,412
but I was actually using my strength
and my youth to the height.

661
00:44:22,412 --> 00:44:23,997
I was burning out.

662
00:44:23,997 --> 00:44:27,125
I could not exceed 150 pounds...

663
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:29,920
no matter how much I ate...

664
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,924
There was so much mental work there.

665
00:44:34,091 --> 00:44:37,302
I had, ultimately, no free time.

666
00:44:37,302 --> 00:44:41,056
So I resigned my position.

667
00:44:41,056 --> 00:44:43,725
Of course, gave them plenty of warning.

668
00:44:43,725 --> 00:44:47,688
And decided to come back to California.

669
00:44:48,981 --> 00:44:52,359
I have to say to myself,
what does it mean to me?

670
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:55,154
What does this mean to me?

671
00:44:55,154 --> 00:44:58,907
What is it going to mean to me?

672
00:44:58,907 --> 00:45:02,744
I recognize this and"..."

673
00:45:02,744 --> 00:45:06,373
A couple of things
when I was instructing motivation...

674
00:45:06,373 --> 00:45:09,209
back in Salt Lake City...

675
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:11,295
is that, you know...

676
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:15,299
if we don't stop and ask ourselves
a question once in a while...

677
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:20,429
to probe our subconscious
or to probe our conscious"..."

678
00:45:20,429 --> 00:45:23,974
I used to teach it.
It's a plain, simple formula.

679
00:45:23,974 --> 00:45:26,476
We reduced everything to a formula,
memorized it...

680
00:45:26,476 --> 00:45:28,937
and therefore we were
able to repeat it constantly.

681
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:31,064
I used to call it the R2/A2 Formula.

682
00:45:31,064 --> 00:45:35,027
Recognize, relate, assimilate,
and put into action.

683
00:45:35,027 --> 00:45:39,031
Like I could be driving
down the freeway and see a 450 SL...

684
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:42,534
and I can say, "Hey, I like that."
What does that mean to me?

685
00:45:42,534 --> 00:45:45,829
What would I have to do to get it?
How can I do it?

686
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:48,332
And then go to work for it. And strive for it.

687
00:45:48,332 --> 00:45:50,334
It kind of makes life easy.

688
00:45:50,334 --> 00:45:52,544
I think that's why a lot of people don't...

689
00:45:52,544 --> 00:45:55,380
They get frustrated.
They have emotional problems...

690
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,384
because they don't know
how to cope with their mind.

691
00:46:01,386 --> 00:46:04,348
There are three things that I've got to do...

692
00:46:04,348 --> 00:46:08,018
that anybody has to do
if they want to be successful.

693
00:46:08,018 --> 00:46:11,355
To have the desire, the "want to."

694
00:46:11,355 --> 00:46:14,274
Why do you go to work in the morning?

695
00:46:14,274 --> 00:46:16,193
Gee, why am I here?

696
00:46:16,193 --> 00:46:19,905
Because you want to.

697
00:46:19,905 --> 00:46:22,032
But that's obvious.

698
00:46:22,032 --> 00:46:25,118
And then, the next
very important ingredient...

699
00:46:25,118 --> 00:46:29,122
is something that a lot of people
and businesses fail to delve into.

700
00:46:29,414 --> 00:46:31,458
It's the activity-knowledge.

701
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:34,878
It would be the equation...

702
00:46:34,878 --> 00:46:38,590
to a mathematical problem.
It would be equal...

703
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:42,594
to the chemist's ability
to emulsify chemicals.

704
00:46:43,554 --> 00:46:47,558
You know, properly, the valences.

705
00:46:47,808 --> 00:46:51,562
But the knowledge of it, the
whole scope, everything in detail.

706
00:46:51,562 --> 00:46:55,524
And then the third element would be
the know-how or the experience.

707
00:46:56,108 --> 00:46:59,528
I have the inspiration to action.
I don't have the activity-knowledge...

708
00:46:59,528 --> 00:47:02,447
but I'm getting the know-how
before the activity-knowledge.

709
00:47:02,447 --> 00:47:06,451
In fact, I'm getting more know-how
than activity-knowledge.

710
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:10,455
But they can be correlated together.
They can be overlapped.

711
00:47:10,581 --> 00:47:14,585
Our youngest son, graduated from Chico...

712
00:47:15,252 --> 00:47:18,964
with a degree in Business Administration.

713
00:47:18,964 --> 00:47:20,841
He thought that this entitled him...

714
00:47:20,841 --> 00:47:24,595
to an executive position
out in the world somewhere.

715
00:47:24,595 --> 00:47:28,515
After many interviews
he found that it wasrt that easy.

716
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:30,475
So he agreed to come home...

717
00:47:30,475 --> 00:47:34,313
and, with a lot of reluctance,
to try this out...

718
00:47:34,313 --> 00:47:38,317
to see how he and his lovely father
would get along.

719
00:47:38,525 --> 00:47:41,361
College is an interesting experience...

720
00:47:41,361 --> 00:47:44,281
and I was kind of taken with it
my first few years.

721
00:47:44,281 --> 00:47:46,658
I would study eight or nine hours a night.

722
00:47:46,658 --> 00:47:50,621
I really caught up on the idea
of doing a lot of studying.

723
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:53,332
But towards the end of my college days...

724
00:47:53,332 --> 00:47:57,336
I ended up partying
more than I did actually studying.

725
00:47:59,129 --> 00:48:00,881
You know, I learned a lot.

726
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:04,176
I took many classes...

727
00:48:04,176 --> 00:48:08,180
say, in Mathematics,
Business Administration...

728
00:48:08,388 --> 00:48:09,973
Marketing, and things like that.

729
00:48:09,973 --> 00:48:13,227
You're given things to learn...

730
00:48:13,227 --> 00:48:16,355
however, you don't retain
the knowledge that you learn.

731
00:48:16,355 --> 00:48:20,192
It's the idea that you're applying
your brain, you're exercising it.

732
00:48:20,192 --> 00:48:24,196
That's the part
where the education comes in, I think.

733
00:48:44,675 --> 00:48:48,053
Something also that happened,
it happens to everybody, I suppose.

734
00:48:48,053 --> 00:48:52,057
I fell in love up in Chico.

735
00:48:52,307 --> 00:48:55,352
I think the important thing
in falling in love...

736
00:48:55,352 --> 00:48:57,729
before you fall in love, you should have...

737
00:48:57,729 --> 00:49:01,733
True love, I think, is experiencing
many different types of loves...

738
00:49:02,317 --> 00:49:06,280
and learning exactly what you want
out of a relationship.

739
00:49:08,115 --> 00:49:12,119
I spent about two and a half years
with a woman.

740
00:49:13,537 --> 00:49:16,665
I fell in and out of love
and I learned a lot of things.

741
00:49:16,665 --> 00:49:19,710
"Nothing lasts forever"...

742
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:23,672
was something that hit home.

743
00:49:26,508 --> 00:49:30,512
I think a broken heart is something
that everybody should experience.

744
00:49:30,512 --> 00:49:34,474
Because it makes you appreciate...

745
00:49:34,766 --> 00:49:38,604
any future experiences that you have.

746
00:49:38,604 --> 00:49:40,147
You've felt the hurt...

747
00:49:40,147 --> 00:49:44,151
so you can enjoy
the positive aspects of love.

748
00:49:44,735 --> 00:49:47,237
I finished all those experiences...

749
00:49:47,237 --> 00:49:50,115
and I came back here to the park...

750
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:54,119
and my father offered to take me on...

751
00:49:55,078 --> 00:49:57,581
to teach me the business.

752
00:49:57,581 --> 00:49:59,541
I knew we had many houses up here...

753
00:49:59,541 --> 00:50:02,586
and I would have no problem
having a place to live.

754
00:50:02,586 --> 00:50:06,256
And I lived down in the chicken coop
down in the little house for a while.

755
00:50:06,256 --> 00:50:08,091
Then I got this place...

756
00:50:08,091 --> 00:50:12,095
which is a pretty nice place
for just one person.

757
00:50:13,347 --> 00:50:15,599
The House on the Hill is what we call it.

758
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,601
And so, I moved up here.

759
00:50:17,601 --> 00:50:19,770
I still haven't completely moved up here.

760
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:23,732
I still have a lot of my stuff
down in the chicken coop.

761
00:50:35,536 --> 00:50:39,248
My dad initiated this whole program...

762
00:50:39,248 --> 00:50:42,251
I would say, approximately six years ago.

763
00:50:42,251 --> 00:50:46,129
So therefore he has
the greater amount of knowledge.

764
00:50:46,129 --> 00:50:50,133
He has the public relations
with the veterinary doctors.

765
00:50:50,843 --> 00:50:52,803
He knows them not only by name...

766
00:50:52,803 --> 00:50:56,807
but also by their secretaries'
and also their wives' names.

767
00:50:57,224 --> 00:50:59,351
He has a vast amount of knowledge.

768
00:50:59,351 --> 00:51:03,355
My brother Danny has been working
in the park for about three years.

769
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:08,068
He has quite some knowledge
of procedures and public relations.

770
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:14,324
Therefore my father is the focal point.

771
00:51:15,492 --> 00:51:19,454
He trained my brother,
he gave him the knowledge.

772
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:23,584
He taught him this route
that I'm responsible for now.

773
00:51:25,669 --> 00:51:28,172
I find it quite hard right now...

774
00:51:28,172 --> 00:51:31,842
to go out on my daily task here at the park...

775
00:51:31,842 --> 00:51:35,846
without consulting my brother or my father.

776
00:51:36,555 --> 00:51:40,559
One thing in the insurance business
that I always did, that got me ahead...

777
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:45,439
is I was able to memorize quite well
with hardly any effort.

778
00:51:47,316 --> 00:51:51,278
I have to literally memorize the streets
and localities of veterinary clinics.

779
00:51:52,362 --> 00:51:54,281
These clinics are literally...

780
00:51:54,281 --> 00:51:57,201
speckled all over
that southern peninsula area.

781
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:59,495
I have to get on the freeway
and go to this one...

782
00:51:59,495 --> 00:52:02,331
and come back on to this one
and pick up from where I left.

783
00:52:02,331 --> 00:52:05,709
I have to memorize the routes,
know exactly where they are.

784
00:52:05,709 --> 00:52:07,669
What road to take to get to it...

785
00:52:07,669 --> 00:52:10,380
to get back on to the right road,
to get to the next one.

786
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:14,384
Naturally, there's an element of fear
that I have.

787
00:52:19,723 --> 00:52:21,725
With our Permalloy markers...

788
00:52:21,725 --> 00:52:25,395
we have several different formats
that the people can choose from.

789
00:52:25,395 --> 00:52:28,565
You can see some
of the different formats right here.

790
00:52:28,565 --> 00:52:32,569
In some situations when the people
don't have actual photographs...

791
00:52:33,529 --> 00:52:36,824
they can sketch a picture...

792
00:52:36,824 --> 00:52:40,244
right on to the alloy steel.

793
00:52:40,244 --> 00:52:43,747
Probably the most popular type of marker...

794
00:52:43,747 --> 00:52:45,791
that we have in the Permalloy...

795
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:49,253
is what we call a vertical-type picture.

796
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:52,256
The reason being,
in a vertical type picture...

797
00:52:52,256 --> 00:52:55,884
they can place the photograph
in a position...

798
00:52:55,884 --> 00:52:59,429
so they are getting maximum amount
of surface coverage...

799
00:52:59,429 --> 00:53:02,182
with maximum amount of wordage usage.

800
00:53:02,182 --> 00:53:05,602
I have to keep telling myself...

801
00:53:05,602 --> 00:53:09,606
there's going to be more parts to this.

802
00:53:09,982 --> 00:53:13,986
There's going to have to be
an advance selling program.

803
00:53:14,611 --> 00:53:16,780
I'd like to be selling in Los Angeles...

804
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:20,742
and getting the cemeteries there
and starting another one in LA.

805
00:53:21,618 --> 00:53:25,622
Maybe Seattle, a larger city
where there are a lot of animals.

806
00:53:26,748 --> 00:53:30,711
With our private burials
we have two systems of marking.

807
00:53:30,961 --> 00:53:33,714
The first is what we call a grid system.

808
00:53:33,714 --> 00:53:36,967
The way it works is we have a rectangle...

809
00:53:36,967 --> 00:53:40,387
with letters and then numbers.

810
00:53:40,387 --> 00:53:43,473
In a vertical position we put numbers...

811
00:53:43,473 --> 00:53:47,311
and the numbers go from 1 to 17,
and then we have the alphabet.

812
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:50,772
It's a cross situation where an animal...

813
00:53:50,772 --> 00:53:53,233
say, Bonnie...

814
00:53:53,233 --> 00:53:56,445
would be 9-W.

815
00:53:56,445 --> 00:54:00,407
What that would mean
is that the people would go to Row 9...

816
00:54:00,491 --> 00:54:03,285
then they'd go to "W"...

817
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:05,287
and where those two points crossed...

818
00:54:05,287 --> 00:54:07,831
you would have the location.

819
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:10,542
This opportunity doesn't mean
a damn thing to you...

820
00:54:10,542 --> 00:54:14,546
unless you're willing to work hard...

821
00:54:15,297 --> 00:54:17,841
to study, to be a student...

822
00:54:17,841 --> 00:54:21,803
and to apply your experience,
and to do better constantly.

823
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:26,016
So I think that's what my father's
done for many years.

824
00:54:26,016 --> 00:54:28,352
And I know, I've seen his successes.

825
00:54:28,352 --> 00:54:31,063
He's read the same textbooks I have.

826
00:54:31,063 --> 00:54:35,067
Danny is basically doing the same thing.

827
00:54:36,944 --> 00:54:39,029
And this is what I have to do.

828
00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:43,033
I have to learn to put
this knowledge into reality.

829
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:57,548
"The basic tenet of our church...

830
00:54:57,548 --> 00:55:00,050
"the Bubbling Well Church
of Universal Love...

831
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:03,679
"incorporated in January of 1977 is...

832
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:06,056
"the Church has as its tenets...

833
00:55:06,056 --> 00:55:10,060
"a belief in a supreme being
who does not differentiate...

834
00:55:11,436 --> 00:55:15,440
"in bestowing his benevolence
on all species of life...

835
00:55:15,691 --> 00:55:19,653
"whether of this earth
or any form of life hereafter."

836
00:55:22,072 --> 00:55:24,449
The thought occurred to me...

837
00:55:24,449 --> 00:55:28,078
that any god, any supreme being...

838
00:55:28,078 --> 00:55:32,040
that was indeed compassionate
and concerned about people...

839
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:36,545
would surely be concerned
about any living creature.

840
00:55:36,753 --> 00:55:40,716
God is supposed to know
when the sparrow falls...

841
00:55:40,757 --> 00:55:43,594
when the lilies of the field bloom.

842
00:55:43,594 --> 00:55:46,471
So surely, at the gates of heaven...

843
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:49,391
an all-compassionate god...

844
00:55:49,391 --> 00:55:53,145
or an all-compassionate supreme
being is surely not going to say. ;

845
00:55:53,145 --> 00:55:57,065
"Well, you're walking in on two legs,
you can go in.

846
00:55:57,065 --> 00:56:01,028
"You're walking in on four legs,
we can't take you. "

847
00:56:01,612 --> 00:56:05,616
I don't believe this will happen.

848
00:56:06,158 --> 00:56:09,036
Now people come up
and there is a common bond.

849
00:56:09,036 --> 00:56:13,040
At the church,
we don't have formal services.

850
00:56:13,123 --> 00:56:17,085
We're not trying to save any souls
or collect money or anything like that.

851
00:56:19,755 --> 00:56:22,633
It's sort of a church of love.

852
00:56:22,633 --> 00:56:26,637
We do not have to go too far afield
to make this conversion...

853
00:56:27,012 --> 00:56:31,016
because we have our own chapel...

854
00:56:32,017 --> 00:56:36,021
we have stained-glass windows,
we even have a bell.

855
00:56:36,647 --> 00:56:40,609
We're usually talking in terms of death
and talking in terms of hereafter.

856
00:56:42,402 --> 00:56:46,406
Well, this is the very essence
of any other religion.

857
00:56:46,532 --> 00:56:50,536
So if in the hereafter there are no pets,
I think"..."

858
00:56:50,869 --> 00:56:54,873
I don't think any of us
that love our pets would really...

859
00:56:55,499 --> 00:56:57,793
feel, maybe"..."

860
00:56:57,793 --> 00:57:00,462
I can't say we wouldn't want to go, but"..."

861
00:57:00,462 --> 00:57:04,424
I really believe that they'll all be there
in spirit with all of us.

862
00:57:05,676 --> 00:57:09,680
The pet owners that we have talked to...

863
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:12,015
have embraced the idea...

864
00:57:12,015 --> 00:57:15,978
and it has had a very dramatic effect
on a lot of them.

865
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,898
It's brought them assurance, it makes sense.

866
00:57:19,898 --> 00:57:22,568
And it's not"..."

867
00:57:22,568 --> 00:57:26,155
It's very hard to refute it,
as a matter of fact...

868
00:57:26,155 --> 00:57:28,198
because it makes sense.

869
00:57:28,198 --> 00:57:30,701
You don't have to depend on a lot of...

870
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:34,163
mystical type of thinking.

871
00:57:34,163 --> 00:57:35,873
It just makes sense.

872
00:57:35,873 --> 00:57:38,167
And people at this time
are looking for assurance.

873
00:57:38,167 --> 00:57:42,129
They don't want pie in the sky,
they don't want fairytales.

874
00:57:54,474 --> 00:57:58,479
Trooper was the type of dog
that didn't have other dogs to relate to.

875
00:57:58,729 --> 00:58:00,522
He lived with adult human beings.

876
00:58:00,522 --> 00:58:03,150
And having the inability...

877
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:07,154
to communicate like human beings do
through conversation...

878
00:58:07,196 --> 00:58:11,158
he did it with his mannerisms,
his eyes, and reception.

879
00:58:11,575 --> 00:58:14,286
One of the things
that you noticed with him...

880
00:58:14,286 --> 00:58:17,831
was when we were sitting in a room,
he would position himself...

881
00:58:17,831 --> 00:58:19,249
and as each one of us spoke...

882
00:58:19,249 --> 00:58:23,212
the tone of their voices would
direct his attention to that person.

883
00:58:23,545 --> 00:58:25,756
And during the course of the conversation...

884
00:58:25,756 --> 00:58:28,967
if the conversation was pleasant,
he would react to that...

885
00:58:28,967 --> 00:58:31,053
or if it was sharp, he would react to that.

886
00:58:31,053 --> 00:58:35,057
And he also had a sense as to what
the subject of the conversation was.

887
00:58:35,057 --> 00:58:37,726
In particular, at Christmas time...

888
00:58:37,726 --> 00:58:41,688
the discussion about gifts
to various members of the family.

889
00:58:41,897 --> 00:58:45,859
And there were certain things
that we knew he would like...

890
00:58:46,026 --> 00:58:49,112
as to doggy bones
and little chewy things that he had.

891
00:58:49,112 --> 00:58:52,950
We didn't conceive that he would
be aware of our conversation...

892
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:55,160
but we were relating to him,
because as I say...

893
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:59,164
there was no one else he could
talk and relate to except ourselves.

894
00:58:59,748 --> 00:59:03,085
Christmas morning,
in fact, this was just before his death...

895
00:59:03,085 --> 00:59:06,213
we all came down to open our presents...

896
00:59:06,213 --> 00:59:09,925
they were all laid out in various
sections around the Christmas tree.

897
00:59:09,925 --> 00:59:12,719
And we would hand each one of us a gift...

898
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:16,557
particularly, my mother-in-law,
her being the elder of the family...

899
00:59:16,557 --> 00:59:17,724
we'd bring her presents.

900
00:59:17,724 --> 00:59:19,810
He lined himself up and couldn't wait...

901
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:23,564
and he went right to the direction
of where his packages were...

902
00:59:23,564 --> 00:59:25,983
and started unwrapping them,
right in there...

903
00:59:25,983 --> 00:59:27,818
they were not laid out in the open.

904
00:59:27,818 --> 00:59:31,780
And he unwrapped his presents
just like sharing with all of us there.

905
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:35,742
It's amazing that there are
so many different aspects of this.

906
00:59:36,285 --> 00:59:40,289
It's not just, you know,
an opening in the ground...

907
00:59:40,289 --> 00:59:42,875
somebody prefers a casket or not...

908
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:46,336
and the ground is put back
into the opening. No.

909
00:59:46,336 --> 00:59:50,299
Sometimes the people like to come up,
witness the actual burial of the animal.

910
00:59:51,008 --> 00:59:53,302
Sometimes they don't.

911
00:59:53,302 --> 00:59:57,264
We pick out a date that's convenient
for them and they come up.

912
00:59:57,681 --> 01:00:01,685
As far as preparation,
a hole has to be dug, prepared.

913
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:07,691
We have to make sure that the hole
is going to fit the size of the casket.

914
01:00:07,733 --> 01:00:10,736
You don't want to make it too large
because you'll waste space.

915
01:00:10,736 --> 01:00:14,072
And you don't want to make it
too small or you can't get it in there.

916
01:00:14,072 --> 01:00:17,659
Mentally, I don't worry about putting
an animal down into an opening...

917
01:00:17,659 --> 01:00:21,663
because if I don't do it,
somebody else will have to do it.

918
01:00:21,872 --> 01:00:25,876
It's just mind over matter.
You have to prepare yourself for it.

919
01:00:27,211 --> 01:00:31,215
We pick up animals
that are 150 pounds, greyhounds.

920
01:00:31,298 --> 01:00:33,675
They're very heavy.

921
01:00:33,675 --> 01:00:37,137
We have to bring them in to our bodies...

922
01:00:37,137 --> 01:00:39,765
to be able to hoist them into the truck.

923
01:00:39,765 --> 01:00:43,060
It's mind over matter once again.

924
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:45,646
Sometimes they come in,
when we get them...

925
01:00:45,646 --> 01:00:48,148
their hair is matted...

926
01:00:48,148 --> 01:00:52,152
and they're very moist from
being in a freezer where they're kept.

927
01:00:52,152 --> 01:00:55,864
So they have to be combed
and dried out a bit.

928
01:00:55,864 --> 01:00:59,743
It isn't the most pleasant thing in
the world. But it's not that bad, really.

929
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:03,747
After a while it becomes something
that doesn't really bother you at all.

930
01:01:07,835 --> 01:01:10,712
But I don't know what happens
down there. I really don't.

931
01:01:10,712 --> 01:01:14,716
The moisture, the contraction,
the expansion of the ground...

932
01:01:15,926 --> 01:01:18,262
of course, the insects
and so on and so forth.

933
01:01:18,262 --> 01:01:22,224
There's another world down there,
you know.

934
01:01:35,279 --> 01:01:38,699
He'd go down on his front knees,
and I knew something drastic...

935
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:40,701
He'd just black out.

936
01:01:40,701 --> 01:01:43,120
Just fall over and black out,
just for a few seconds.

937
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,956
- Then he'd get back up again.
- Ready to go.

938
01:01:45,956 --> 01:01:48,292
We took him down to the vets.

939
01:01:48,292 --> 01:01:52,296
We had test after test.
They couldn't find nothing.

940
01:01:53,463 --> 01:01:57,467
One day we took him back to the same vet...

941
01:01:57,718 --> 01:02:01,722
because that vet,
he's darn good, we liked him a lot.

942
01:02:02,347 --> 01:02:06,351
He called us up, said, "I've found out
what's wrong with York."

943
01:02:08,395 --> 01:02:10,856
- "He has heartworms."
- Heartworms.

944
01:02:10,856 --> 01:02:13,859
I'm telling you, if I never tell anybody
anything else again...

945
01:02:13,859 --> 01:02:16,862
please watch your dogs for heartworm.

946
01:02:16,862 --> 01:02:19,239
It's carried by mosquitoes...

947
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:21,950
just like your malaria. And you don't know.

948
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:24,286
We used to think we were free from it here.

949
01:02:24,286 --> 01:02:26,413
But we're not. It was a Southern disease.

950
01:02:26,413 --> 01:02:29,249
But here in California, it's very prevalent.

951
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:31,251
I ask myself, "What does this mean to me?

952
01:02:31,251 --> 01:02:34,838
"What does this park,
this opportunity mean to me?"

953
01:02:34,838 --> 01:02:36,924
Well, it means a lot.

954
01:02:36,924 --> 01:02:39,510
It means that I'll be able to...

955
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:43,305
have something to work for
for many years to come.

956
01:02:43,305 --> 01:02:47,267
It will provide the things that I will need...

957
01:02:48,852 --> 01:02:52,856
the long line of the other things, events.

958
01:02:57,569 --> 01:03:00,531
Phil has moved into the business.
He's slowly learning it.

959
01:03:00,531 --> 01:03:04,368
He's learning the route right now
and he'll be taking that over.

960
01:03:04,368 --> 01:03:07,955
But at the same time, he's learning
about the private burials...

961
01:03:07,955 --> 01:03:09,915
he's learning about handling the people...

962
01:03:09,915 --> 01:03:13,293
because there's definitely
things you have to know...

963
01:03:13,293 --> 01:03:16,004
to be able to talk to the people
about their pets.

964
01:03:16,004 --> 01:03:19,800
You have to see by example,
you have to learn by example.

965
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,135
We're working together.
We have our ups and downs.

966
01:03:22,135 --> 01:03:24,304
He's a bit older than I am.

967
01:03:24,304 --> 01:03:28,183
It provides some hardships because
I'm the one telling him what to do...

968
01:03:28,183 --> 01:03:32,146
and he doesn't always like that.
He resents it at times.

969
01:03:35,566 --> 01:03:37,943
My father is in charge of the park.

970
01:03:37,943 --> 01:03:41,947
He's El Presidento, you know.
He's Number One.

971
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:47,244
Danny, by virtue of seniority
and knowledge is Number Two.

972
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:50,581
I guess I would be the third person.

973
01:03:50,581 --> 01:03:54,585
My father now is trying
to work out of the business...

974
01:03:55,169 --> 01:03:58,881
because he's getting on in years,
and he wants to do a little traveling...

975
01:03:58,881 --> 01:04:00,924
before he passes on.

976
01:04:00,924 --> 01:04:04,928
So he's letting up
and he's letting me take over...

977
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:08,599
the handling of the people
and he's staying in the background.

978
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:12,436
Although, I don't think he'll ever stay
completely in the background...

979
01:04:12,436 --> 01:04:16,440
because he's a fairly dominant person.

980
01:04:17,608 --> 01:04:21,028
Then he came out of it,
and he was perfectly normal...

981
01:04:21,028 --> 01:04:24,072
and racing through Golden Gate Park
along the ocean beach.

982
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:28,076
And then just as suddenly,
we took him over for a checkup...

983
01:04:28,452 --> 01:04:32,414
to recheck the prior prognosis.

984
01:04:33,499 --> 01:04:37,461
They thought he was all right.
He came home on a Wednesday.

985
01:04:37,461 --> 01:04:41,423
And I can recall he was so relieved
to get out of that veterinarian office...

986
01:04:42,257 --> 01:04:43,634
having been in there all day.

987
01:04:43,634 --> 01:04:47,429
He had a habit to me.
I always got a kiss on the knee area.

988
01:04:47,429 --> 01:04:51,391
I recall that as probably the last
time I remember him doing that.

989
01:04:51,517 --> 01:04:54,353
And then, just as suddenly as the kiss...

990
01:04:54,353 --> 01:04:58,357
he seemed to go right down,
and we kept phoning the vets...

991
01:04:58,607 --> 01:05:00,442
and they said not to worry...

992
01:05:00,442 --> 01:05:04,154
that they didn't like to eat when
they were under medication...

993
01:05:04,154 --> 01:05:05,697
but to bring him in on Monday.

994
01:05:05,697 --> 01:05:09,701
But, before that happened, we ran him
to the Animal Emergency Hospital...

995
01:05:10,619 --> 01:05:12,913
and to Dr. Benjamin there.

996
01:05:12,913 --> 01:05:15,499
It was too late. He was gone by then.

997
01:05:15,499 --> 01:05:17,668
He just passed away on the Sunday after it.

998
01:05:17,668 --> 01:05:21,046
But the main thing is for people
who have dogs...

999
01:05:21,046 --> 01:05:23,549
and they don't breed them...

1000
01:05:23,549 --> 01:05:26,260
the most intelligent thing
I would recommend would be...

1001
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:29,930
when the dog is,
I suppose the same for cats...

1002
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:32,224
about two or three years old...

1003
01:05:32,224 --> 01:05:34,560
that is the time
to make a decision to have them...

1004
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:35,686
Neutered.

1005
01:05:35,686 --> 01:05:39,648
You keep that idea of building
this place up, of fixing it up...

1006
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:43,694
and eventually it will be something
that nothing else can compare with.

1007
01:05:44,111 --> 01:05:48,115
That idea keeps the whole thing together.

1008
01:05:50,576 --> 01:05:54,580
That concept is what
keeps us together, I think.

1009
01:05:55,372 --> 01:05:58,750
My dad used to tell me
when I was a young kid...

1010
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:02,754
I'd look at a job that had to be done,
and he'd say, "Nothing's impossible."

1011
01:06:04,548 --> 01:06:08,468
That stuck in my craw. I couldn't
believe it. "Nothing's impossible."

1012
01:06:08,468 --> 01:06:10,721
I learned
when I got in the insurance business...

1013
01:06:10,721 --> 01:06:13,348
that everything is possible.

1014
01:06:13,348 --> 01:06:16,768
It's just you have to look at it
with the right frame of mind.

1015
01:06:16,768 --> 01:06:20,022
And that's important, your mind.

1016
01:06:20,022 --> 01:06:23,984
There's a tendency to sit on your laurels...

1017
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:27,779
and be somewhat complacent...

1018
01:06:27,779 --> 01:06:31,783
about small advances
and small accomplishments.

1019
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:35,078
Or even sometimes large accomplishments...

1020
01:06:35,078 --> 01:06:37,456
have a tendency to put you at ease.

1021
01:06:37,456 --> 01:06:39,708
However, this is a trap.

1022
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:43,670
Because we are not content...

1023
01:06:44,296 --> 01:06:47,216
with just having an ordinary...

1024
01:06:47,216 --> 01:06:50,177
nice, or good pet cemetery.

1025
01:06:50,177 --> 01:06:52,804
Ours is going to be the finest.

1026
01:06:52,804 --> 01:06:56,809
We're not going to stop
until ours is the finest in the country.

1027
01:06:57,768 --> 01:07:00,771
There'll be no finer when we're through.

1028
01:07:00,771 --> 01:07:03,398
When I'd hire a guy...

1029
01:07:03,398 --> 01:07:06,193
I'd bring him into my office.

1030
01:07:06,193 --> 01:07:10,197
And I had specifically designed
my office so I could display...

1031
01:07:10,364 --> 01:07:14,243
the maximum trophies on walls and stuff.

1032
01:07:14,243 --> 01:07:18,205
I bring this guy in, who had probably
been making $9,000 a year or less.

1033
01:07:19,581 --> 01:07:23,585
I'd bring him into this office
with nice furniture.

1034
01:07:23,585 --> 01:07:25,838
He'd see these trophies, and, you know"..."

1035
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:29,299
They were taken away.

1036
01:07:29,299 --> 01:07:32,636
It's kind of like flaunting it, I guess.

1037
01:07:32,636 --> 01:07:36,640
To hire him all I did was tell stories
about what each trophy meant to me...

1038
01:07:37,558 --> 01:07:39,226
what it could mean to him...

1039
01:07:39,226 --> 01:07:43,230
and if he would like to increase
his income and his future.

1040
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:47,484
The names of our gardens were created...

1041
01:07:47,651 --> 01:07:51,655
by words that seemed to depict...

1042
01:07:53,615 --> 01:07:57,578
the qualities of pets,
like our Garden of Companionship.

1043
01:07:58,203 --> 01:08:00,664
A pet is a companion.

1044
01:08:00,664 --> 01:08:04,668
The Garden of Devotion.

1045
01:08:05,127 --> 01:08:09,089
Almost all pets are devoted to their masters.

1046
01:08:09,089 --> 01:08:13,093
The Garden of the Gentle Giants,
again, is descriptive.

1047
01:08:14,261 --> 01:08:17,431
Kitty Kurve, the Reserve Garden set aside...

1048
01:08:17,431 --> 01:08:20,809
and reserved for smaller pets.

1049
01:08:20,809 --> 01:08:23,479
The Garden of Memory...

1050
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:25,355
is set aside...

1051
01:08:25,355 --> 01:08:29,359
because it will bring happy memories
in the future, we hope.

1052
01:08:30,903 --> 01:08:33,572
We had a Valentine's Day party
for all the wives.

1053
01:08:33,572 --> 01:08:35,532
I think there was about six of us.

1054
01:08:35,532 --> 01:08:37,326
I told the guys to come over.

1055
01:08:37,326 --> 01:08:41,330
We were going to have a cake and
celebrate Valentine's Day.

1056
01:08:42,581 --> 01:08:45,667
So we got a big cake and all the wives came.

1057
01:08:45,667 --> 01:08:48,170
I had this motivational meeting planned.

1058
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:51,215
You know, they didn't know
exactly what was going on.

1059
01:08:51,215 --> 01:08:53,383
And I had all these signs on the wall.

1060
01:08:53,383 --> 01:08:57,387
I had made up a chart, a commitment chart.

1061
01:08:57,846 --> 01:09:00,516
Anyway, we had the cake
and we had the girls talk...

1062
01:09:00,516 --> 01:09:02,351
and we read the material...

1063
01:09:02,351 --> 01:09:04,853
the motivational material
for prizes and trophies...

1064
01:09:04,853 --> 01:09:07,731
to be won the subsequent week.

1065
01:09:07,731 --> 01:09:10,150
We got the girls motivated.

1066
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:13,654
And the girls got the guys motivated.

1067
01:09:13,654 --> 01:09:16,615
We created the Garden of Honor.

1068
01:09:16,615 --> 01:09:19,535
And in this garden we will bury...

1069
01:09:19,535 --> 01:09:23,497
a Seeing Eye dog or a police dog
killed in the line of duty...

1070
01:09:24,915 --> 01:09:27,751
at no cost...

1071
01:09:27,751 --> 01:09:30,629
if it's killed in the line of duty.

1072
01:09:30,629 --> 01:09:34,633
And for anybody else
who wants to share this garden...

1073
01:09:35,551 --> 01:09:38,220
then we created a price...

1074
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:41,640
which amounts to more than
any other garden that we have.

1075
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:44,268
I think that I'm motivated all the time...

1076
01:09:44,268 --> 01:09:48,272
because I have so many experiences...

1077
01:09:48,272 --> 01:09:52,276
of motivation. I understand it quite well.

1078
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:56,238
One thing that this gentleman...

1079
01:09:56,238 --> 01:10:00,200
to my left always said, and it
sticks in my brain all the time is that:

1080
01:10:00,659 --> 01:10:03,453
"The emotions
are not always subject to reason...

1081
01:10:03,453 --> 01:10:06,999
"but they are always subject to action."

1082
01:10:06,999 --> 01:10:11,003
We all have periods of inertia where
we don't want to get up and do things.

1083
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,298
So I have to tell myself psychologically:

1084
01:10:14,298 --> 01:10:17,467
"It's going to be a great day,
I'll have a great day today."

1085
01:10:17,467 --> 01:10:21,472
And I repeat it over and over. And
actually do the thing with that in mind.

1086
01:10:22,014 --> 01:10:24,850
I've been trying to teach it to my brother.

1087
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:27,936
As a matter of fact, couple of months
ago, I wrote him a letter.

1088
01:10:27,936 --> 01:10:31,773
I tried to write him a very motivational letter.

1089
01:10:31,773 --> 01:10:35,736
Because at the time
he was very inspirationally dissatisfied.

1090
01:10:35,736 --> 01:10:37,446
I don't go out very much...

1091
01:10:37,446 --> 01:10:40,782
so what I do to pass the time...

1092
01:10:40,782 --> 01:10:43,285
aside from watching television, of course...

1093
01:10:43,285 --> 01:10:46,788
is I would sit down
and put these tracks down on tape...

1094
01:10:46,788 --> 01:10:49,583
and just play guitar.

1095
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:53,587
It's something that gives me
a lot of personal satisfaction.

1096
01:10:53,837 --> 01:10:57,716
With any type of a musical instrument,
you're never going to be bored.

1097
01:10:57,716 --> 01:11:01,345
So much of the time, people say,
"What am I going to do?

1098
01:11:01,345 --> 01:11:04,890
"There's nothing to do." They're always
continually complaining.

1099
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:07,309
But with a musical instrument,
you can sit down...

1100
01:11:07,309 --> 01:11:11,313
and you can provide
your own entertainment.

1101
01:12:10,372 --> 01:12:11,582
Even my kids.

1102
01:12:11,582 --> 01:12:15,586
I try to abstain from the word "not"...

1103
01:12:15,669 --> 01:12:19,673
and "can't," and "no," and stuff like
that, which are very negative words.

1104
01:12:19,923 --> 01:12:23,927
And try to instill,
rather than physical punishment...

1105
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,430
but just saying"..."

1106
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:29,933
My youngest girl
is two and a half years old...

1107
01:12:29,933 --> 01:12:33,937
and it's very hard for her to understand
the language, rationalize it.

1108
01:12:35,063 --> 01:12:37,900
I sit her down when
she's done something wrong and I say:

1109
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:40,777
"Good girls don't do this.

1110
01:12:40,777 --> 01:12:44,573
"Good girls do things that make us happy."

1111
01:12:44,573 --> 01:12:47,075
We created our little lakes...

1112
01:12:47,075 --> 01:12:51,079
because we feel this gives
an atmosphere of tranquility...

1113
01:12:51,413 --> 01:12:55,375
and helps to break up the rows
of little headstones...

1114
01:12:56,585 --> 01:13:00,589
which can be very monotonous
and not too appealing.

1115
01:14:24,173 --> 01:14:28,135
In former years, I would write
three or four songs a week...

1116
01:14:28,177 --> 01:14:30,596
and I've got a little notebook...

1117
01:14:30,596 --> 01:14:34,600
where I've got about probably 50 songs.

1118
01:14:34,683 --> 01:14:37,269
You always have the dream
in the back of your mind...

1119
01:14:37,269 --> 01:14:40,647
that someday these songs
will be published and you'll be famous.

1120
01:14:40,647 --> 01:14:43,734
But as you get older, you start realizing...

1121
01:14:43,734 --> 01:14:47,738
that maybe those are just what
they were, dreams. Nothing more.

1122
01:14:49,281 --> 01:14:51,533
Dreams are nice to have.

1123
01:14:51,533 --> 01:14:54,661
Something to look forward to.

1124
01:14:54,661 --> 01:14:58,665
It gives you more satisfaction.
Something you can think about.

1125
01:14:59,041 --> 01:15:00,959
Our mind is like a computer.

1126
01:15:00,959 --> 01:15:02,878
You know, if our mind read...

1127
01:15:02,878 --> 01:15:05,881
or extracted a data-line from it...

1128
01:15:05,881 --> 01:15:08,759
if you put in positive,
you would get out positive.

1129
01:15:08,759 --> 01:15:11,136
If you put in negative,
you'd get out negative.

1130
01:15:11,136 --> 01:15:12,888
So you have to understand that.

1131
01:15:12,888 --> 01:15:16,308
Our mind is"..."
We can go into a negative part...

1132
01:15:16,308 --> 01:15:17,976
and into a positive part...

1133
01:15:17,976 --> 01:15:21,104
and if you want to get more involved,
there's an in-between:

1134
01:15:21,104 --> 01:15:24,942
Where people never get really negative
and people never really get positive...

1135
01:15:24,942 --> 01:15:26,276
what they call "gray area."

1136
01:15:26,276 --> 01:15:29,571
But the mind reacts to suggestion.

1137
01:15:29,571 --> 01:15:32,199
And suggestion is merely...

1138
01:15:32,199 --> 01:15:35,661
an external force or an external thing...

1139
01:15:35,661 --> 01:15:38,831
that you perceive through your senses.

1140
01:15:38,831 --> 01:15:41,834
You know, like your smell,
your sight, your feeling.

1141
01:15:41,834 --> 01:15:45,587
You could even be smelling
a big vat of spaghetti...

1142
01:15:45,587 --> 01:15:48,757
you know, and it suggests to you
that you're hungry.

1143
01:15:48,757 --> 01:15:52,594
So therefore, our strongest power...

1144
01:15:52,594 --> 01:15:55,806
that we have is in suggestion.
In the power of prayer.

1145
01:15:55,806 --> 01:15:59,810
That's the strongest power that we have.

1146
01:16:00,644 --> 01:16:04,648
Success is like a journey.

1147
01:16:04,731 --> 01:16:07,943
And when you finally achieve success
in your given field...

1148
01:16:07,943 --> 01:16:11,947
the journey's over. You have to look
for something else to motivate you.

1149
01:16:13,866 --> 01:16:17,870
There was a famous doctor who was
one of the first to climb Mt. Everest.

1150
01:16:17,911 --> 01:16:20,164
Right at the end
he looked up at the mountain...

1151
01:16:20,164 --> 01:16:22,124
The first time he tried it, he failed.

1152
01:16:22,124 --> 01:16:25,878
And as he was coming down
from the mountain, he looked at it...

1153
01:16:25,878 --> 01:16:28,338
and said, "I'll climb Mt. Everest."

1154
01:16:28,338 --> 01:16:32,342
He says, " Mountains don't grow,
but men always will. "

1155
01:16:35,262 --> 01:16:38,807
There's a principle of law that with
every benefit there's a burden.

1156
01:16:38,807 --> 01:16:41,894
And the responsibility
that you have with a dog"..."

1157
01:16:41,894 --> 01:16:44,396
It's not just an inanimate object.

1158
01:16:44,396 --> 01:16:48,150
In our life today,
we do focus a lot of our attention...

1159
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:51,778
on material things
such as automobiles, clothes...

1160
01:16:51,778 --> 01:16:53,822
trips, and things of that sort.

1161
01:16:53,822 --> 01:16:55,782
And even objects, paintings...

1162
01:16:55,782 --> 01:16:59,745
and other kinds of things at home
that you cherish.

1163
01:16:59,745 --> 01:17:02,372
Well, an animal, I think,
much more so, you cherish...

1164
01:17:02,372 --> 01:17:04,333
because he does respond to you.

1165
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:06,126
He doesn't talk like a human being...

1166
01:17:06,126 --> 01:17:08,670
but he is much more
than just an inanimate object.

1167
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:12,049
Therefore, the responsibility
that a person has to the animal...

1168
01:17:12,049 --> 01:17:14,301
you sense that when you have them.

1169
01:17:14,301 --> 01:17:16,678
Because their love and affection
comes to you.

1170
01:17:16,678 --> 01:17:19,223
And that love and affection,
over a period of years...

1171
01:17:19,223 --> 01:17:20,849
becomes a part of your life.

1172
01:17:20,849 --> 01:17:23,852
And you can't discard them...

1173
01:17:23,852 --> 01:17:27,815
to such a degree like you can
a wrapper around some food...

1174
01:17:28,273 --> 01:17:32,277
and say, "Well, it's finished
and it disappeared."

1175
01:17:32,361 --> 01:17:35,364
When a dog dies suddenly
like Trooper died...

1176
01:17:35,364 --> 01:17:38,659
the moment of decision came.
"What do we do with him?"

1177
01:17:38,659 --> 01:17:40,869
I could only think of Trooper's face...

1178
01:17:40,869 --> 01:17:42,996
and he'd say,
"Where are you going to put me?"

1179
01:17:42,996 --> 01:17:44,206
There's something to life...

1180
01:17:44,206 --> 01:17:47,167
that even when you discard something
of an inanimate nature...

1181
01:17:47,167 --> 01:17:51,171
you dispose of it
with some kind of reverence.

1182
01:17:53,048 --> 01:17:57,010
I've got a stereo system
aside from a recording system.

1183
01:17:57,219 --> 01:18:00,848
It's a Pioneer SX-1010.

1184
01:18:00,848 --> 01:18:04,059
It's 100 watts per channel,
which is very powerful.

1185
01:18:04,059 --> 01:18:06,270
On some occasions...

1186
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:08,939
say late afternoon,
when there's nobody at the park...

1187
01:18:08,939 --> 01:18:11,400
I'll take my speakers
and I'll put them outside...

1188
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:14,236
and turn it up.

1189
01:18:14,236 --> 01:18:18,240
You can hear it.
It goes through the whole valley.

1190
01:18:18,407 --> 01:18:22,369
You can hear it from miles away.

1191
01:19:38,487 --> 01:19:40,823
I think we'll all be together again.

1192
01:19:40,823 --> 01:19:43,367
I think we're going to live
pretty much like we do here.

1193
01:19:43,367 --> 01:19:45,077
I want to be able to find my pets.

1194
01:19:45,077 --> 01:19:48,288
I don't want them dug up
and scattered all over creation.

1195
01:19:48,288 --> 01:19:50,999
I want them
right where I know where they are...

1196
01:19:50,999 --> 01:19:54,294
where it's like in humming fields like
they've had in this life.

1197
01:19:54,294 --> 01:19:56,505
I believe that we'll all be reunited.

1198
01:19:56,505 --> 01:19:59,591
I really do. I believe that
from the bottom of my heart.

1199
01:19:59,591 --> 01:20:02,928
She's got me believing that now,
I never believed in it before.

1200
01:20:02,928 --> 01:20:05,556
But I still do.

1201
01:20:05,556 --> 01:20:09,560
'Cause after all, there's your dog.
Your dog's dead.

1202
01:20:09,852 --> 01:20:12,813
But where's the thing that made it move?

1203
01:20:12,813 --> 01:20:14,565
It had to be something, didn't it?

1204
01:20:14,565 --> 01:20:17,151
There's your spirit. There it is.

1205
01:20:17,151 --> 01:20:19,194
I might be dead, but I'm not moving.

1206
01:20:19,194 --> 01:20:21,405
And you can't put that back in them.

1207
01:20:21,405 --> 01:20:25,409
But I can take the body where it
will be with it and lay it to rest.

1208
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:28,579
It's a beautiful thing.

1209
01:20:28,579 --> 01:20:32,374
It can rest there or be right
around there. It'll stay close.

1210
01:20:32,374 --> 01:20:36,044
It'll stay where he is, and I'll find it again.

1211
01:20:36,044 --> 01:20:40,007
I really will. They'll be with us.

1212
01:20:40,883 --> 01:20:42,259
I hope she's right.

1213
01:20:42,259 --> 01:20:45,512
I think I'm right.
In fact, I almost know I'm right.

1214
01:20:45,512 --> 01:20:49,516
- You'd bet on it, huh?
- I'd bet a lot on it.

1215
01:20:52,019 --> 01:20:54,938
My assurance to the pet owners...

1216
01:20:54,938 --> 01:20:58,942
is that they will be reunited with their pet...

1217
01:20:59,234 --> 01:21:01,445
at some time in the future.

1218
01:21:01,445 --> 01:21:05,449
Maybe under different circumstances
and in a different form...
