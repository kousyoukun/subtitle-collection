In "Jailhouse Rock",
he was everything rockabilly is about.

11
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,454
I mean, he is rockabilly.

12
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,541
Mean, surly, nasty, rude.

13
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,335
In that movie,
he couldn't give a fuck about nothing.

14
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,213
Except rocking and rolling,
living fast, dying young

15
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,090
and leaving a good-looking corpse,
you know?

16
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,848
I watch that hillbilly
and I wanna be him so bad.

17
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,893
Elvis looked good.

18
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,898
Hey, I ain't no fag.
But Elvis was prettier than most women.

19
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,400
You know? Most women.

20
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:56,533
You know, I always said, if I had
to fuck a guy, I mean, had to...

21
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,827
if my life depended on it...

22
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,872
I'd fuck Elvis.

23
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,916
I'd fuck Elvis.

24
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,880
- Really?
- Well, when he was alive, not now.

25
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,050
I don't blame you.

26
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,802
So, we'd both fuck Elvis.

27
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,543
It's nice to meet people
with common interests, ain't it?

28
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,770
Well, enough about the King.
How about you?

29
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,524
How about me what?

30
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,695
How about you go to the movies
with me tonight?

31
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,574
What are we gonna see?

32
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,618
A Sonny Chiba triple feature.

33
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,828
"The Street Fighter",
"Return of the Street Fighter",

34
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,081
and "Sister Street Fighter".

35
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,042
Who's Sonny Chiba?

Who's Sonny Chiba?

37
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:53,882
Well, he is, bar none, the finest actor
working in martial arts movies today.

38
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,344
You wanna take me
to a kung fu movie?

39
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,848
Three kung fu movies.

40
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,729
I don't think so.

41

No, no.

It's Sonny Chiba.

Thanks. Thanks a lot.

Is he supposed to be a good guy?

84
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,475
Well, he ain't so much a good guy
as he's just a bad motherfucker.

85
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,353

to fuck guys up, you know.

In a theatre full of empty seats,
why did you sit by me?

Cos you looked like a nice guy.

134

I got the keys,

- Almost four years.

That's a long time.

145
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,256
Yeah, I know, but it's not so bad.
I mean, I'm pretty friendly

146
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,401

so I just hang out, you know,

147
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,385
bullshit, read comic books.

148
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,179
You get paid a lot?

149
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,724
No, that's where the trouble
comes into paradise.

150
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,685

he lets you borrow money

See, in this one here, Nick,
he's gotten this ring

156
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:48,166
for his sweetheart and he wears it
around his neck on a chain.

157
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:52,253

in this fight with some Nazi bastard.

158
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,339
And the Kraut,
he grabs hold of the chain.

159
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,216
Well, the ring goes overboard.

160
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,763

What is it? You're crying?
What did I do? Did I do something?

176
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,876
- You didn't do nothing.
- What is it?

177
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,380
I have something I gotta tell you.

178
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,887
I didn't just happen to be at that theatre.
I was paid to be there.

179
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,516
If you were paid to be there, what are you?
A theatre checker?

180
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,643
You get paid to check up
on the box-office girls?

181
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,413
Make sure they're not
ripping the place off?

182
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:17,398
I'm not a theatre checker.
I'm a call girl.

183
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,235
You're a whore?

184
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,613
No, I'm a call girl,
and there's a difference, you know!

185
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:30,578
OK, here it goes. You know the place
you took me to last night?

186
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,372
The place you work.

187
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:35,333
- Heroes for Sale?
- You got a boss, right?

188
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,668
- Yeah.
- OK, what's his name?

189
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:39,587
Lance.

190
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,006
That's him.
He called the place where I work.

191
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,675
He ordered a girl for you.
He said he wanted you to get laid.

192
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:48,054
Said you didn't get out much,
and it was your birthday and all.

193
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,974
He wanted me to act
like I just showed up.

194
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,061
Now, how did he know
you were gonna be at that theatre?

195
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:57,230
Well, I go to the movies
every year on my birthday.

196
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,357
In fact, he called me up
this week to find out

197
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,567
what my birthday movie
was gonna be.

198
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,903
You're not mad?

199
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:08,658
No, man. I can't tell you, that was
one of the best times I ever had.

200
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,911
It was. You know, I knew something
must be rotten in Denmark.

201
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,038
There's no way
you could like me that much.

202
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,207
I can't tell you how relieved I was,

203
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,001
when you took off your dress,
you didn't have a dick.

204
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,295
Stop being so fucking calm
about all this!

205
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,631
Go look in your house.
There's a note on your TV.

206
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,717
And all it says is, "Dear Clarence,"
because I couldn't write any more.

207
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,262
So I just said, "Alabama, come clean."

208
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,639
And just tell him what's what,
and if he tells you

209
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,393
to go back to Drexl and fuck yourself,
then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself.

210
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,812
Drexl? What's a Drexl?

211
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,106
Please shut up!
I'm trying to come clean, OK?

212
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:43,359
I've been a call girl for exactly four
days, and you're my third customer.

213
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:47,155
I want you to know
that I am not damaged goods.

214
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,032
I'm not what they call in Florida
"white trash"!

215
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,201
I'm a really good person.

216
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:57,206
And when it comes to relationships,
I am 100 percent...

217
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:02,670
I'm 100 percent monogamous.

218
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,756
You stay with one guy?

219
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:09,719
Exactly. If I'm with you,
then I'm with you.

220
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,512
And I don't want anybody else.

221
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,226
Now I gotta tell you something else.

222
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,979
When you said last night was
one of the best times you ever had,

223
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,564
did you mean physically?

224
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:25,193
Well... yeah, yeah.
But I'm talking about the whole night.

225
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:29,614
I mean, I never had as much fun with a girl
as I had with you my whole life.

226
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:33,284
It's true, you like Elvis,
you like Janis,

227
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:37,163
you like kung fu movies,
you like "The Partridge Family"!

228
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:41,292
Actually, I don't like
"The Partridge Family".

229
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,878
That was part of the act.

230
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,424
Clarence...

231
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,469
And I feel really goofy saying this

232
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:57,183
after only knowing you one night,
and me being a call girl and all.

233
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,770
But I think I love you.

234
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,654
Wait a second.

235
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:15,785
Look, I've been trying to keep
this whole thing in perspective.

236
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,161
You just said you loved me.

237
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,473
Now, if I say I love you,
and just throw caution to the wind

238
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:20,937
and let the chips fall
where they may

239
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,334
and you're lying to me,
I'm gonna fucking die.

240
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,503
I'm not lying to you.

241
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:30,550
And I swear from this moment forth,
I'll never lie to you again.

242
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:47,066
- Well, hello, Mrs Worley.
- How do you do, Mr Worley?

243
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,903
- Top of the morning to you, Mrs Worley.
- The bottom of the night, Mr Worley.

244
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,322
By the way, have you seen
your lovely little wife today?

245
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,659
Are you speaking of my beautiful,
charming, sexy wife, Mrs Alabama Worley?

246
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,787
- Why, are there any others, Mr Worley?
- No, not for me, no.

247
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,914
- No. No.
- Yes, yes.

248
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:14,135
Excuse me. Do you think you could
turn down the heat just a teeny bit?

249
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:21,601
Bama, I gotta ask you a question.
Who and what is a Drexl?

250
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,936
- Shh!
- Huh?

251
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:27,023
- He was my pimp.
- You had a pimp?

252
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,901
I was a call girl.

253
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,279
Call girls have pimps.

254
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:34,780
Was he black?

255
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,993
He thinks he is. He said his mama was
an Apache, but I suspect that he's lying.

256
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,162
Is he nice?

257
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:46,250
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
He treated me pretty decent.

258
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,253
I was only there for four days.
He got a little bit rough the other day.

259
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,340
- What do you mean? With you?
- No, with my friend Arlene.

260
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,301
What did he do to Arlene?

261
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,613
Slapped her around a little bit.
Kicked her in the stomach.

262
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:01,932
- It was pretty scary.
- This motherfucker sounds beautiful.

263
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,646
What did you do to end up
with a son of a bitch like that?

264
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,776
What you motherfuckers talking about?

265
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,403
Floyd say he don't be eating pussy.

266
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:18,658
Drexl... shit, any nigger says
he don't eat pussy's lying his ass off.

267
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:19,950
I heard that.

268
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,911
Hold on a second.
Big D, you saying

269
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,036
you eat pussy?

270
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,290
Yeah, motherfucker, I eat everything.
I eat the pussy, I eat the butt.

271
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,042
I eat every motherfucking thing.

272
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,671
If I ever did eat some pussy...
I would never eat any pussy, right?

273
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,547
But if I did eat some pussy,

274
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,384
I sure as hell wouldn't tell
no-goddamn-body about it.

275
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,678
I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker, man.

276
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,283
Shit, nigger, you smoke enough sherm,

277
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,932
your dumb ass will do
a lot of motherfucking things.

278
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,726
You'd be up in there
sucking niggers' dicks!

279
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,982
Yo, man, fuck you guys, man!
You guys are fucked up, all right?

280
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,308
Hey, yo. Yo. Wait a second.
We're just fucking with you.

281
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,945
Huh?

282
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,949
In fact, I'm gonna show you
what I mean with a little demonstration.

283
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,492
Toss me the burner.

284
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,622
All right, peep this.

285
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:11,711
Pretend it's that fine, centrefold bitch.

286
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:15,506
You know what I'm saying?
And you're you...

287
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:03,053
- Honey, where you going?
- Bathroom.

288
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,699
♪ Well, I'm so lonely

289
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:27,161
♪ I get so lonely, I could die ♪

290
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,791

291
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,585
- I said can you live with it?
- Live with what?

292
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,214
That son of a bitch walking
around breathing the same air as you.

293
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,341
Getting away with it every day.

294
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,886
- Are you haunted?
- Yeah.

295
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,972
You wanna get un-haunted?

296
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:51,060
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, I'd kill him.

297
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:54,063
Shoot him in the face,
put him down like a dog.

298
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,524
I can't believe what you're telling me.

299
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,026
I'm not saying nothing.
I'm just saying what I'd do.

300
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,528
You'd do that?

301
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,905
The fuck don't deserve to live.

302
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,492
Look, he's haunting me, you know.

303
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:10,412
I do wanna kill him, but I don't wanna
spend the rest of my life in jail.

304
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,373
Hey, man, I don't blame you.

305
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,501
- If I thought I'd get away with it...
- Get away with it?

306
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:19,421
Killing's the hard part.
Getting away with it, that's easy.

307
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:22,007
You think a cop gives a fuck
about a pimp?

308
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,053
Listen. Every pimp in the world
could get shot.

309
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:30,558
Two in the back of the fucking head.
Cops would throw a party, man.

310
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,604
As long as you're not
at the scene of the crime

311
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,731
with a smoking gun in your hand,

312
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,692
you'll get away with it.

313
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,986
Clarence, I like you.

314
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:45,239
Always have, always will.

315
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,390
Bama...

316
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,850
Where you going?

317
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:18,355
I need you to write down
your former address.

318
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,480
Why?

319
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,027
Well, so I can go over there
and pick up your stuff, that's why.

320
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:27,072
Oh, baby, come on, Clarence.
I just wanna disappear from there.

321
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,077
Look, Bama, I know he scares
the shit outta you,

322
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:30,826
but I am not scared
of that motherfucker.

323
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:34,955
You are completely out of his reach.
He poses absolutely no threat to you.

324
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,749
If he doesn't matter,
which he doesn't,

325
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:39,352
then it just seems silly to lose
all your things now, that's all.

326
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,878
Shh! Listen.

327
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,839
You don't know him.

328
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:47,343
No, you don't know me.
Not when it comes to shit like this.

329
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,304
I need to do this.

330
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:54,099
I want you to know that
you can count on me to protect you.

331
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,855
Come on, please just write it down.

332
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,615
This isn't a good idea.

333
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:14,495
I'm telling you, it's gonna be fine.
I'll be in and out of there.

334
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,708
- Be careful.
- I will.

335
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,215
- I love you.
- I love you too.

336
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:31,989
Do you want something?

337
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,408
- Yeah, you Drexl?
- No, man, I'm Marty.

338
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,785
Well, I wanna talk to Drexl.

339
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,912
Well, what the fuck
you wanna talk to him about?

340
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,332
It's about Alabama.

341
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,391
He was asking about Alabama.

342
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,730
- Where the fuck is that bitch?
- She's with me.

343
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,399
Who the fuck are you?

344
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,693
I'm her husband.

345
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,699
Well, that makes us practically related.

346
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,662
Have a seat, boy.
You have yourself an egg roll.

347
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:23,749
We got everything here from
a diddle-eyed Joe to damned if I know.

348
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,168
No, thanks.

349
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,425
No, thanks? What that mean?

350
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,804
I think you're too scared to be eating.

351
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,270
Now, see...

352
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:49,274
We're sitting down here,
ready to negotiate.

353
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,402
And you've already given up your shit.

354
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,571
I'm still a mystery to you.

355
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:57,825
But I know exactly where
your white ass is coming from.

356
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,576
See, if I ask if you want some dinner

357
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,787
and you grab an egg roll
and start to chow down,

358
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:04,015
I say to myself, "This motherfucker,
he's carrying on like he ain't got"

359
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,959
"a care in the world."
And who knows? Maybe he don't.

360
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:13,966
Maybe this fool is such a bad motherfucker,
he don't got to worry about nothing.

361
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:17,427
He just sit down,
watch my motherfucking TV.

362
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:19,513
See?

363
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,393
You ain't even sat down yet.

364
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:27,271
And on that TV over there,
since you've been in the room,

365
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:30,274
there's a woman with her breasts
just hanging out.

366
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,068
You ain't even bothered to look.

367
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,904
You just been clocking me.

368
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:43,954
Now, I know I'm pretty. But I ain't
as pretty as a couple of titties.

369
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:49,376
Ooh-ee! This child be fierce.

370
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,515
I'm not eating because I'm not hungry.

371
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,240
I'm not sitting because I'm not staying.

372
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:09,354
I ain't looking at the movie because
I already seen it seven years ago.

373
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,731
It's "The Mack".

374
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,066
Max Julian, Carol Speed
and Richard Pryor.

375
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,154
I ain't scared of you,
I just don't like you.

376
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,573
And that envelope right there,
it's some pay-off money.

377
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,617
Alabama's moving on
to some greener pastures.

378
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:23,619
We're not negotiating,
I don't like to barter.

379
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,513
What's in the envelope right there
is for my peace of mind.

380
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,832
My peace of mind is worth that much.
Not one penny more.

381
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,136
It's empty-

382
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:54,775
Marty, you know what we got here?
A motherfucking Charlie Bronson.

383
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,612
Mr Majestyk?

384
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:02,366
Lookie here... Charlie.

385
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:07,496
None of this bullshit is necessary.
I don't got no hold over Alabama.

386
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,916
I was just trying to lend a girl
a helping hand.

387
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,134
You wanna fuck with me?

388
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,117
Come here, mutha!

389
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:14,896
Now, you see what you get
when you fuck with me, white boy!

390
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:18,400
Look at this! Making fun
of my motherfucking peeps?

391
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:22,279
Shit! You motherfucker!
Your ass fucking crazy!

392
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,873
You must've thought
it was white-boy day.

393
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,169
It ain't white-boy day, is it?

394
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,421
No, man, it ain't white-boy day.

395
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,215
Shit, man,
you done fucked up again.

396
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:00,150
Well, well, well.

397
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,487
Lookie what we got here.

398
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,115
Clarence Worley?

399
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:11,745
It sounds almost like a nigger name.

400
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:14,456
And I know where you live.

401
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:20,170
4900, 160th Street.
Apartment 48.

402
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:25,175
And I'd make a million-dollar bet
that Alabama is at the same address.

403
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,804
Marty, take the car, go get her.
Bring her dumb ass back here.

404
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,724
I think I'll keep lover boy here
entertained.

405
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:35,352
Roxanne, where's my jacket?

406
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:37,521
Hey, Roxanne!

407
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:40,190
Hey, Marty!
What the fuck are you doing?

408
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,763
- I can't find my jacket!
- Go look in the fucking hamper.

409
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:56,081
You! Get a bag
and put Alabama's things in it.

410
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:59,668
You wanna get fucking shot?
Get a bag and put Alabama's things in it!

411
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:02,796
I just did you the biggest
fucking favour of your life!

412
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,008
Open your eyes.

413
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:09,094
I said, open your fucking eyes!

414
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,764
You thought it was pretty fucking funny,
didn't you?

415
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:16,601
Fuck you!
Fuck you, you piece of shit!

416
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:21,982
Don't fucking move!

417
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:26,945
'I was selfish.
I know I was selfish. I was, but...

418
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,407
'I was carrying your child, babe.'

419
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,670
I killed him.

420
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,339
Want a hamburger or something?
I'm fucking starving to death.

421
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,341
Is this a joke?

422
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,218
No joke.

423
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:55,140
Hmm! That's the best goddamn fucking
hamburger I ever had in my entire life.

424
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:57,767
I've never had a hamburger
taste this good.

425
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:01,104
Come on, eat something,
you'll feel better.

426
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:10,197
What the fuck you crying for, huh?

427
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,616
I mean, Christ, he's not worth
one of your tears.

428
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,576
Would you rather it have been me?
Is that it?

429
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:17,579
Huh? Is that what you want?
I mean, do you love him?

430
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,789
Do you love him?

431
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:22,292
I said, do you fucking love him? Huh?

432
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,586
- I think what you did was...
- What?

433
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,922
- I think what you did...
- What?

434
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,509
Was so romantic.

435
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:39,643
Oh, baby, you're bleeding.

436
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:45,148
I got your things right here.

437
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,112
Clean clothes?

438
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:55,367
- I love you.
- I love you. There is a God.

439
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:23,061
These aren't my clothes.

440
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,709
Rommel, where are you?
Come here. Come on, boy.

441
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,502
Get in here. Get in here now.

442
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,462
Get in here. Go on!

443
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,452
Morning, Daddy.

444
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,331
Hey, Rommel.
Long time no see, huh?

445
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,541
Oh, yeah, good boy.

446
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:33,840
Now, you're gonna have
to excuse the place.

447
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:40,597
I haven't been exactly doing a lot
of entertainment of company as of late.

448
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,392
I'm sorry if I seem a little tense,

449
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:49,105
but you're the last person in the world
that I expected to see this morning.

450
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,941
Well, that's OK, Daddy,
I tend to have that effect on people.

451
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:55,779
You got anything to drink around here?
I'm dying of thirst.

452
00:35:55,945 --> 00:36:00,325
Now, there should be...
There should be a 7UP in there.

453
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,828
Anything stronger? Probably not.

454
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:06,831
Beer. You can drink beer, can't you?

455
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,959
I can, but I don't.

456
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,172
That's about all I ever eat.

457
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:17,926
Excuse me.

458
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:19,844
Hello, hello, hello.

459
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:22,514
I'm his father.

460
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:27,602
Well, that's all right. I'm his wife,
Alabama Worley. Pleased to meet you.

461
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,772
We got married.

462
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,500
Lover, why don't you be a sport
and go get us some beer?

463
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,377
You want some beer?

464
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,587
I mean, if you want some,
it'll be here. All right?

465
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,589
Where is there a liquor store
around here?

466
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,426
There is a party store
down 54th Street.

467
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,346
Get a six-pack
of something imported.

468
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:06,975
Hard to tell you what to get,
cos different places have different things.

469
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:11,479
- Here, that should cover it, okey-dokey?
- Okey-dokey, doggy daddy.

470
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:26,202
Ain't she the sweetest goddamn thing
you ever saw in your whole life?

471
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,122
I mean, is she a four-alarm fire,
or what?

472
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,792
She seems very nice.

473
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:38,131
Nice? Daddy, nice ain't the word.
This girl, she's a peach.

474
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:41,843
You know, she even tastes like a peach.

475
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:45,013
You can tell I'm in love with her,
can't you?

476
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,183
No, wait. I gotta talk.

477
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:52,604
Clarence... Sit down. Shut up.

478
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,648
You give me a fucking headache.

479
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:59,444
I mean, you are so much
like your mother, I can't believe it.

480
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,905
You're your fucking mother
through and through.

481
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,074
I haven't heard from you
in three years.

482
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:09,037
You show up all of a sudden,
at eight o'clock in the morning,

483
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,540
you walk in here
like a goddamned bulldozer.

484
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:16,461
Now, don't get me wrong,
I love you, I'm glad to see you.

485
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,423
But slow it down, man.

486
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,468
All right?

487
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,429
Now...

488
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,185
When did you get married?

489
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,605
Well, Daddy, er...

490
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:43,863
I'm in big fucking trouble.
I just... I really need your help.

491
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,824
No, no, stop talking!

492
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,246
- What do you want from me?
- What?

493
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:54,916
What do you want from me?
Stop acting like an infant!

494
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,919
You're out here because you want me
to help you in some way.

495
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,129
What do you need from me?
You need money?

496
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,799
No. You still have friends
on the force?

497
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:04,801
Yes, I still have friends on the force.

498
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:07,178
Could you just find out
if they know anything about us?

499
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,157
I don't think they know shit. But I don't
wanna think, I wanna know for sure.

500
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,975
You can do that, right?

501
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,395
- What makes you think that I could do that?
- Cos you were a cop.

502
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,731
But what makes you think
that I would do that?

503
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,234
Because I'm your son.

504
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,486
Oh, you're my son.

505
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:28,157
Oh, you got it all worked out, don't you?
Huh? Oh, yeah.

506
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:32,203
Look. I mean, goddamn, I've never
asked you for a goddamn thing, huh?

507
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,664
But Jesus fucking Christ!
After Mom divorced you,

508
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,542
did I ever ask you for anything?
No. I didn't.

509
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:40,295
And when I wouldn't see you
for a year-and-a-half to two years,

510
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,046
did I ever get in your shit about it?

511
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,358
In that whole fucking time
you were a drunk, did I ever get mad

512
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:48,678
and point my finger at you? No! I never
did. Everybody else did, but I didn't.

513
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,764
Now look, I just need help,
and you can fucking help me. All right?

514
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:56,519
Now, I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy.
If I didn't really need it, I wouldn't ask.

515
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:01,691
I mean, if you want to say no,
then fine.

516
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:05,278
Forget it, don't worry about it.
No problem, I'm gone, all right?

517
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,827
The forager's back!

518
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,972
Thank God. I could eat a horse,
if you slap enough ketchup on it.

519
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:20,251
- I didn't get you any chicken.
- Well, how come?

520
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,296
Honey, it's too early in the morning.
It's only nine o'clock.

521
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,423
Son of a bitch.

522
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:35,183
Dick Ritchie? Dick Ritchie!

523
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:36,643
That's me, I'm me.

524
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:39,729
- Come inside.
- OK.

525
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,321
Sit. Sit, Sit, Sit.

526
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:52,200
Now, the part you will be reading for
is one of the bad guys.

527
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:54,410
- There's Brian and Marty.
- Who?

528
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,206
- Is there a problem?
- No, no.

529
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:00,708
Peter Breck has already been cast
in the part of Brian.

530
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,752
So, you'll be reading
for the role of Marty.

531
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:07,507
In this scene, you're both in a car,
and Bill Shatner is hanging on the hood.

532
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:10,301
What you want to do is get him off.

533
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,178
All right, I'm Marty.

534
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,974
- Ready?
- Yeah.

535
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:17,767
OK.

536
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:21,270
I'm driving. OK.

537
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,023
Where the fuck did he come from?

538
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,109
I don't know,
he just appeared like magic.

539
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:29,112
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him!

540
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,657
- Get him!
- Thank you, Mr Ritchie.

541
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:36,285
I'm very impressed.
You're a very fine actor.

542
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,039
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

543
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,626
- We'll let you know.
- OK.

544
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,795
- OK, one-handed.
- One hand.

545
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:50,550
Oh! Slipped in the other one there.
Here comes the train.

546
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:05,898
Well, they found nothing.
In fact, they think it's drug related.

547
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:08,693
Drug related? Why drug related?

548
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:12,030
Well, apparently Drexl had
his big toe stuck in that shit.

549
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,406
Really?

550
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:17,326
Drexl had an association
with a fellow named Blue Lou Boyle.

551
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,912
- Name mean anything to you?
- No.

552
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,518
Well, if you don't hang around his circle,
no reason it should.

553
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:23,582
Why? Who is he?

554
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:26,502
Gangster, drug dealer. Somebody
that you don't want on your ass.

555
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:31,215
Now look, Clarence,
the more I hear about this Drexl fucker,

556
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,092
the more I think you did the right thing.

557
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,053
This guy wasn't just some wild flake.

558
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:38,073
No, man, that's what
I was trying to tell you before.

559
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,224
The guy was like a mad dog.

560
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:43,770
So, the cops, they don't think...
They're not after us.

561
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:46,522
No. Until they hear something better,

562
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:50,026
they'll just assume Drexl had
a falling out with Blue Lou.

563
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:54,155
And once you leave town,
I wouldn't even worry about it.

564
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,493
Thanks, thanks a lot, Daddy.
You really came through for me.

565
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:05,416
- I got some money I could give you.
- No, keep it. Keep it.

566
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:08,086
Well, now, son...

567
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,589
I want you to know that, er...

568
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:15,760
I hope everything works out
with you and Alabama.

569
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:17,845
I like her.

570
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:22,225
And I think you make
a real cute couple.

571
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:29,482
Yeah, well, you stay out of trouble.
Hmm?

572
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:33,778
You got a, er... You got a wife
to think about now.

573
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,447
Quit fucking around.

574
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:40,785
Son...

575
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:45,581
I love you.

576
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,967
- All right.
- All right.

577
00:43:56,634 --> 00:44:00,555
This is my friend Dick Ritchie's
number and address in Hollywood,

578
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,800
that's where we're gonna be.

579
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:04,517
You can get in touch with me
through him. All right.

580
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:08,187
Come on, Alabama. We're taking off.
Kiss Pops goodbye.

581
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:15,945
Bye, Daddy.
Hope to see you again soon.

582
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:21,200
Hey, hey! What kind
of daughterly smackeroo is that?

583
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:26,998
I'll send you a postcard from Hollywood,
all right?

584
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:29,542
- Now, Bama... Bama.
- Yes, sir?

585
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,127
Take care of that one for me.

586
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:33,897
Don't worry, Daddy. I'm gonna keep
this fella on a short leash.

587
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:37,633
As the sun sets slowly in the west,
we bid you a fine farewell.

588
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,974
Bye, Daddy!

589
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:49,896
Son of a bitch was right.
She tastes like a peach.

590
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:52,607
Come on, Rommel.
Come on, boy, come on, come on!

591
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:55,401
Go on in there. Come on!

592
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:12,293
- Hello?
- ♪ Hello, baby! ♪

593
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,086
- Clarence?
- You got it!

594
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:16,964
Clarence, it's great to hear from you.
What's going on?

595
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,883
Well, you are gonna be
seeing me shortly.

596
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:22,887
- You're coming to LA! When?
- Uh, tomorrow.

597
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:26,241
There's a story behind all that.
I'll tell you when I see you.

598
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:29,101
And by the way, I ain't gonna be alone,
I'm bringing my lovely wife.

599
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,896
Get the fuck outta here!
Clarence, you got married?

600
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,606
I'm a married man, buddy.

601
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:36,752
A married man!
You wanna say "hello" to my better half?

602
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:39,153
- Come here.
- Hi, Dick. This is Alabama Worley.

603
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,280
Hi, how you doing, Alabama Worley?

604
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,243
Hi. Clarence told me all about you.
He said you were his best friend.

605
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,286
So, I guess that makes you
my best friend too.

606
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,748
- Tell him we gotta go.
- Clarence says we gotta go.

607
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,625
Wait, can I speak to Clarence, please?

608
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,378
- Ask him if he got the letter.
- Did you get the letter?

609
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,672
- What letter?
- What letter?

610
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:59,562
- The letter I sent.
- The letter he sent.

611
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:01,968
- I didn't get any letter.
- Has he gotten his mail yet?

612
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:05,471
- Have you gotten your mail yet?
- Well, no, my roommate Floyd...

613
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,766
- Has he looked through it?
- Have you looked through it?

614
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,309
No.

615
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:15,856
- Tell him to go look through it.
- Go and look through it.

616
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,276
Wait, wait, wait.
Can I speak to Clarence, please?

617
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:21,404
He wants to talk to you.

618
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:24,699
No time. Tell him we gotta go.
Tell him, read the letter.

619
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:26,075
Read the letter.

620
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,703
Tell him I love him
and tell him as of tomorrow...

621
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:30,162
Honey, hold this.

622
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:32,456
- Tell him as of tomorrow...
- As of tomorrow...

623
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:37,420
al| of your money problems
are gonna be over.

624
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:39,880
Hello? What money problems?

625
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,174
Bye-bye.

626
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:47,513
Hello? Hello?

627
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,654
Floyd! Floyd, you used up
the last piece of toilet paper!

628
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,802
Hey! Hey! Rommel!

629
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,638
Hey, come here! Rommel! Rommel!

630
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:55,122
Frankie, tell Luca to go outside
and do you know what.

631
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,841
Do you know who I am, Mr Worley?

632
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,845
I give up. Who are you?

633
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:15,226
The Antichrist. You got me
in a vendetta kind of mood.

634
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:16,644
You tell the angels in heaven

635
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,896
you never seen evil
so singularly personified

636
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,357
as you did in the face
of the man who killed you.

637
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:25,986
My name is Vincent Coccotti.
I work as counsel for Mr Blue Lou Boyle.

638
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:27,780
The man your son stole from.

639
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:32,785
I hear you were once a cop,
so I can assume you've heard of us before.

640
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,205
- Am I correct?
- I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.

641
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:40,668
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up

642
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:44,547
the "how full of shit am |?" question
you've been asking yourself.

643
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:47,800
We're gonna have a little Q&A.

644
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:52,847
And at the risk of sounding redundant,
please make your answers genuine.

645
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:56,809
- You want a Chesterfield?
- No.

646
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:01,897
I have a son of my own,
about your boy's age.

647
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,692
I can imagine how painful
this must be for you.

648
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:08,988
But Clarence
and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his

649
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,353
brought this all on themselves.

650
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:14,285
I implore you not to go
down that road with them.

651
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:17,872
You could always take comfort
in the fact you never had a choice.

652
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:24,128
Look, I'd like to help you if I could,
but I haven't seen Clarence.

653
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,300
You see that?

654
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:36,474
That smarts, doesn't it?
To get slammed in the nose.

655
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:39,810
Fucks you all up. You get the pain
shooting through your brain.

656
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:42,188
Your eyes fill up with water.

657
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:44,482
That ain't any kind of fun.

658
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:49,069
But what I have to offer you,
that's as good as it's gonna get.

659
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,864
And it won't ever get that good again.

660
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:56,494
We talked to your neighbours.
They saw a Cadillac.

661
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,038
Purple Cadillac.

662
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:03,792
Clarence's purple Cadillac,
parked in front of your trailer yesterday.

663
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:07,505
Mr Worley... have you seen your son?

664
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,382
I've seen him.

665
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:14,970
I can't be sure of how much he told you,
so, in the chance you're in the dark

666
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,431
about some of this,
let me shed some light.

667
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,517
That whore your boy hangs around with,

668
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:22,728
her pimp is an associate of mine.

669
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,647
Along with his pimping and other affairs,

670
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:28,484
he works for me in a courier capacity.
Well, apparently...

671
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:32,655
that dirty little whore found out
we were gonna do some business,

672
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:36,992
because your son, the cowboy,
and his flame, came into the room blazing

673
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:40,621
and didn't stop until they were
pretty sure everybody was dead.

674
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,708
What are you talking about?

675
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:48,629
I'm talking about a massacre.
They snatched my narcotics.

676
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,966
Hightailed it out of there.
Would have got away with it.

677
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:55,302
But your son, fuckhead that he is,

678
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:59,640
left his driver's licence
in the dead guy's hand.

679
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:05,938
- You know, I don't believe you.
- That's of minor importance.

680
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:09,942
What is of major fucking importance
is that I believe you.

681
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:13,779
Where'd they go?

682
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,990
On their honeymoon.

683
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:24,248
I'm getting angry asking
the same question a second time.

684
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,625
- Where did they go?
- They didn't tell me.

685
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,211
Now, you just wait a minute
and listen to me.

686
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,922
I haven't seen Clarence in three years.

687
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:37,928
He shows up yesterday with a young girl,
saying that he got married.

688
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:45,686
He asked for, er... some quick cash
to go on a honeymoon.

689
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,231
He asked me
if he could borrow $500.

690
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:54,028
I felt like helping him,
so I wrote him out a cheque.

691
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:56,655
We went to breakfast in the morning.

692
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:01,035
And that's the last I saw of him.

693
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,120
So help me God.

694
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:06,665
They never thought to tell me
where they were going.

695
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:11,086
And I never thought to ask.

696
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:43,661
You know...

697
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:48,082
Sicilians are great liars.

698
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,001
The best in the world.

699
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:54,630
I'm Sicilian.

700
00:52:54,755 --> 00:53:00,177
My father was the world heavyweight
champion of Sicilian liars.

701
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:03,597
From growing up with him,
I learned the pantomime.

702
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:06,600
There are 17 different things
a guy can do when he lies

703
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:10,062
to give himself away,
a guy's got 17 pantomimes.

704
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,690
Woman's got 20. Guy has got 17.

705
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,984
If you know them,
like you know your own face,

706
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:18,946
they'd beat lie detectors all to hell.

707
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,824
What we got here is a little game
of show-and-tell.

708
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:24,669
And you don't wanna show me nothing
but you're telling me everything.

709
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:30,457
I know you know where they are,
so tell me,

710
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:33,961
before I do some damage
you won't walk away from.

711
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:40,050
Could I have one of those
Chesterfields now?

712
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:43,470
Sure.

713
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:54,898
You got a match? No, wait.
No, no, don't bother, I got one.

714
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:09,163
- You're Sicilian, huh?
- Yeah, Sicilian.

715
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,710
You know...

716
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:18,505
| read a lot.

717
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,508
Especially things about history.

718
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:25,387
I find that shit fascinating.

719
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:29,933
Here's a fact I don't know
whether you know or not.

720
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:37,816
Sicilians were spawned by niggers.

721
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:46,533
Come again?

722
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,245
It's a fact. Yeah.

723
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:56,418
You see... Sicilians have black blood
pumping through their hearts.

724
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:01,256
And if you don't believe me,
you can look it up.

725
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,635
Hundreds and hundreds of years ago,
you see,

726
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:09,431
the Moors conquered Sicily,
and the Moors are niggers.

727
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:13,227
- Yes.
- So you see, way back then,

728
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:17,022
Sicilians were like wops
from northern Italy.

729
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:21,193
They all had blond hair and blue eyes.
But, well...

730
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:26,031
Then the Moors moved in there

731
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:29,034
and well, they changed
the whole country.

732
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:34,122
They did so much fucking
with Sicilian women, huh,

733
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:37,125
that they changed
the whole blood line forever.

734
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:40,921
That is why blond hair and blue eyes

735
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:44,758
became black hair and dark skin.

736
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,804
You know,
it's absolutely amazing to me...

737
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:55,310
to think that to this day,
hundreds of years later, that...

738
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:01,775
that Sicilians still carry
that nigger gene.

739
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,820
Now, this...

740
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:08,156
No, I'm quoting history.

741
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:12,286
It's written, it's a fact. It's written.

742
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:14,288
I love this guy.

743
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:22,087
Your ancestors are niggers.

744
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:25,007
Hey!

745
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:33,015
And your great, great, great,
great-grandmother fucked a nigger.

746
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:38,061
Yeah.
And she had a half-nigger kid.

747
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:43,066
Now... if that's a fact, tell me:

748
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:45,777
Am I lying?

749
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,741
Cos you...

750
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:55,078
You're part eggplant.

751
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:05,172
Hey, hey, hey!

752
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:08,133
You're a cantaloupe.

753
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:20,562
That was beautiful.

754
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,278
Let me see that.

755
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:43,794
I haven't killed anybody...

756
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:46,546
since 1984.

757
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,885
Go to this comedian's son's apartment.

758
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:57,099
Come back with something
that tells me where that asshole went.

759
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:59,893
So I can wipe this egg off my face.

760
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:15,993
Fix this fucked-up family for good.

761
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,583
Hey, boss.

762
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:25,794
Get ready to be happy.

763
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:31,550
'Morning, everybody. It's 6:22
here in LA. I'm David Perry at KBLU.'

764
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:51,278
Hello? Hi.

765
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,533
Morning!

766
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:57,993
Floyd!

767
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:03,707
Floyd, can't you answer the door,
at least, for me?

768
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:06,501
Oh, man, I didn't even hear it.

769
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:07,669
Hello?

770
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,629
You can't help me out
every now and then?

771
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:11,548
Yes.

772
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:16,678
- Did you call for a date?
- Huh?

773
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:19,639
I knew it was you!

774
00:59:19,765 --> 00:59:21,808
How you doing, man?

775
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,327
Dick, this is Alabama.
Alabama, this is Dick.

776
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:27,272
- Nice to meet you!
- Hi, I'm Alabama.

777
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:29,876
- Clarence, you look good!
- This is a great place, this is nice.

778
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,736
Come on, I'm starving. Let's go get
something to eat. Who's this?

779
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:35,739
- This is Floyd.
- Floyd, all right. Come on!

780
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:38,325
Hey, Floyd.
Watch yourself. Be careful.

781
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:40,786
Hey-

782
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:56,259
Hey, hey. I didn't tell you guys yet?

783
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:59,930
I had this really, really good audition
for "TJ Hooker" the other day.

784
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:04,101
<i>- You're gomg to be on “TA Hooker“?
- Yeah, 'We the new “TA Hooker“.</i>

785
01:00:04,226 --> 01:00:06,770
- Knock on wood.
- You get to meet Captain Kirk?

786
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:08,939
Well, you don't get to meet him
in the audition,

787
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:11,149
but if I get the part, hope, hope...

788
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,277
- That would be amazing.
- It would be cool.

789
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:16,446
Meeting Captain Kirk,
that would be cool.

790
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:29,209
Here we are.

791
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:32,963
The honeymoon suite.

792
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:37,759
You're really in love, aren't you?

793
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:41,096
For the very first time in my life.
Know what that's like?

794
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:42,638
No.

795
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:46,893
- Nah.
- Shut the fuck up.

796
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,937
What are you doing in LA anyway, huh?

797
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:59,573
Holy Mary, mother of God.
This shit can't be real.

798
01:00:59,698 --> 01:01:01,992
- It'll get you high.
- What?

799
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:05,996
- I said, it'll get you high.
- Hey, we got cable.

800
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:11,293
- You want some wine, sweetheart?
- Just a little bit, Not much of a wine gal.

801
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:14,254
That is fucking real.

802
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:17,382
- This is fucking real, Clarence.
- I certainly hope so.

803
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:20,635
You've got a hell of a lot
of cocaine here, man.

804
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,803
I know.

805
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:24,055
Do you realise how much
fucking coke you have here?

806
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:26,057
No, tell me.

807
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:28,310
I don't know, but it's a fucking lot!

808
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,105
This is Drex|'s coke?

809
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,649
No, Drex|'s dead, you see.
It's Clarence's coke.

810
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:36,902
And Clarence, he can do
whatever he wants with it.

811
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:38,862
What Clarence wants to do
is to sell it.

812
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:42,407
Then me and Bama'|| jump on a jet plane
and spend the rest of our lives spending.

813
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:44,701
So you got my letter?
You lined up buyers for me?

814
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:47,204
Listen, Clarence,
I'm not Joe Cocaine, OK?

815
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:49,331
You're an actor,
I hear these Hollywood guys

816
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:51,166
get it delivered to the set
all the time.

817
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:53,668
Well, they do. All right? They do.

818
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:55,938
And maybe one day,
when I start being a successful actor,

819
01:01:55,962 --> 01:02:00,383
I'll be like one of those guys, but until
that day, I ain't got nothing. All right?

820
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:03,094
I don't have a pot to piss in,
or a window to throw it out.

821
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,971
All I got is fucking Floyd.

822
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:08,225
If you want me to help you sell a
little bit at a time, that's all I can do.

823
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:10,435
No, no, no.
None of that little-bit-at-a-time shit.

824
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,372
It's gotta be the whole enchilada
in one shot, that's the way it's gotta be.

825
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:16,316
Clarence, do you have any idea
how difficult that's gonna be?

826
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:17,943
What the fuck you are talking about?

827
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:20,588
I'm offering half-a-million dollars
worth of white for 200 grand.

828
01:02:20,612 --> 01:02:22,948
- You're telling me that's difficult?
- Very difficult!

829
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:25,617
That's very difficult,
do you understand? Listen to me.

830
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:27,970
It's difficult because you're selling
to a particular group,

831
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,663
you understand what I'm talking about?

832
01:02:29,788 --> 01:02:33,124
Fat cats, big shots.
Guys who can afford $200,000.

833
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,531
Guys who can use a whole
fucking suitcase full of cocaine.

834
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,671
Basically, Clarence, guys I don't know.

835
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:41,716
And guys you don't know.
And more importantly, they don't know you.

836
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,430
Come on, Dick.

837
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,981
OK, Clarence. Listen.

838
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,193
There's one guy that I know
that could help you out, Clarence,

839
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:04,155
but I'm not guaranteeing you anything.

840
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:09,953
- Is he big-league?
- No. He's not big-league. OK?

841
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:15,125
But he works as an assistant to a very
big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.

842
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:20,880
Lee Donowitz could afford and can use
$200,000 worth of coke.

843
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:23,091
Being that's what you have.

844
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:25,719
All right, so what did you tell him?

845
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:28,179
What the fuck do you expect me
to tell him, huh?

846
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:30,765
I mean, I didn't know what
was bullshit and what wasn't.

847
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:35,061
And besides, Floyd smoked
the second page of the letter. OK?

848
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:38,732
- What's this acting-class guy's name?
- Elliot.

849
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,151
Elliot what?

850
01:03:41,276 --> 01:03:43,153
Elliot Blitzer.

851
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,489
OK. We'll get him on the phone
and we'll arrange a meeting

852
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:50,577
so we can get through all this
getting-to-know-you stuff, all right?

853
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:53,788
- Where?
- Where should we meet?

854
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:59,836
- Roller-coaster.
- Roller-coasters.

855
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:10,096
So, you got $500,000 worth of cola
that you are unloading for $200,000..

856
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:12,432
You want an animal cracker?

857
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:13,892
Um, thanks.

858
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:19,022
- Wait, save the gorillas.
- Gorillas...

859
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:22,067
I won't. Thanks.

860
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:26,821
So, you got...
$500,000 worth of cola

861
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:29,240
that you're unloading for $200,000.

862
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:32,744
"Unloading." That's a hell of a way
to describe the bargain of a lifetime.

863
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:36,706
- Where did you get it?
- Where did I get it?

864
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:41,002
I grow it on my windowsill.
See, the light's really good up there.

865
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:45,632
I'm up high enough off the street,
so you can't see it. It works perfectly.

866
01:04:45,757 --> 01:04:46,758
Yeah.

867
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:50,345
Where...?
Really, where does it come from?

868
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:52,806
- Where's it come from?
- Yeah.

869
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:55,225
- Coca leaves.
- You're sick. I'm out of here.

870
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:58,937
- Elliot, chill out, chill out.
- Come on, sit down here. All right?

871
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:01,165
We're both here, we might
as well enjoy the ride. All right?

872
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:03,900
I'll tell you. OK? But you gotta
promise me you'll keep it quiet.

873
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:05,503
If Dick hadn't ensured me
you're good people,

874
01:05:05,527 --> 01:05:07,129
I'd just tell you,
none of your fucking business.

875
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:09,364
- OK, OK.
- This is gonna be fun.

876
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:12,659
Let's go!

877
01:05:12,784 --> 01:05:16,246
The truth of the matter is this:
I got a friend in the department.

878
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:17,872
- What department?
- What department?

879
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:20,166
What do you think, eight ball?

880
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:22,460
The police department?

881
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:25,338
Give the man a prize! All right, now,
about a year and a half ago,

882
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,757
this friend of mine got access
to the evidence room.

883
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:30,635
And he snagged this coke,
but he's a good cop with a wife and a kid.

884
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,431
So he held on to it for about a year
until he found a guy he could trust.

885
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,724
- And he trusts you?
- Yeah, he trusts me.

886
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:39,370
We were in 4-H together.
We've known each other since childhood.

887
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:41,580
I'm handling the sales part,
he's my silent partner,

888
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:44,065
and he knows, if I get fucked up,
I won't drop dime on him.

889
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,317
OK?
Now, no further, you understand.

890
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:48,671
All right, he's kind of paranoid,
I didn't tell you nothing.

891
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:51,197
- You didn't hear nothing.
- I didn't hear nothing!

892
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:53,992
All right! Here we go!

893
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,457
Ride it out, baby!

894
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:12,260
Yeah!

895
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:17,182
We're going in for another one!
Hang on, Elliot! Whoo!

896
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:34,866
Oh, yeah, we got this puppy.
This was a good idea.

897
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:43,458
Elliot looks a little green.

898
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:52,217
Elliot, do I look like a beautiful blond
with big tits and an ass

899
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:54,802
that tastes like French-vanilla ice cream?

900
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:56,930
What?

901
01:06:57,138 --> 01:07:00,141
I said, do I look like a beautiful blond
with big tits and an ass

902
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,519
that tastes like French-vanilla ice cream?

903
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:03,895
No.

904
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,356
No. OK, then why are you
telling me all this bullshit, huh?

905
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:10,026
- What, do you wanna fuck me?
- Clarence. He's sick, man.

906
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:11,778
Let me handle this, all right?

907
01:07:11,903 --> 01:07:18,660
You know what? Just get it straight.
Lee is not into taking risks, OK?

908
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:23,122
He's got a couple of guys,
he's been dealing with them for years.

909
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:26,459
They're reliable,
they're dependable, and they're safe.

910
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:29,379
Riddle me this, Batman.

911
01:07:29,504 --> 01:07:32,066
If you're all so much in love with
each other, what are you doing here?

912
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:34,193
I'm sure you've got better things
to do with your time

913
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:36,970
than hang around upside-down
on a roller-coaster all day.

914
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:40,848
Your guy is interested because
with that much shit at his fingertips

915
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:43,726
he could play Joe-fucking-Hollywood
till the wheels come off.

916
01:07:43,851 --> 01:07:45,603
He can sell it, he can snort it,

917
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:48,106
he can play Santa Claus with it,
as far as I'm concerned.

918
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:51,109
At the price he's paying,
he can afford to just throw it around.

919
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:53,154
He's gonna be everybody's best friend,
all right?

920
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:55,238
I'm not putting him down, here.

921
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:57,341
It's his money, let him do
whatever the hell he wants.

922
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:59,605
But don't expect me and my friends
to hang around forever

923
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:01,619
waiting for you guys
to grow some guts, all right?

924
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:03,413
Oh, Jesus!

925
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:08,918
- Yeah, hello?
- Hi, Lee.

926
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:13,131
Elliot, it's Sunday. Can you tell me
why I'm talking to you on Sunday?

927
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:15,901
I don't see enough of you all week,
I gotta talk to you on Sunday, too?

928
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:19,596
I-I-I'm with that party that
you wanted me to get together with, Lee.

929
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:22,432
- You know who I'm talking about?
- I don't believe this, Elliot.

930
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:25,643
Why the hell are you talking to me
on my phone about that?

931
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:30,982
Well, because I'm standing with the guy,
and he insists on talking to you.

932
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:33,234
What, are you out of your fucking mind?

933
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:39,407
He said that if I didn't get you on the
phone, that he wouldn't wanna do...

934
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:42,368
Hello, Lee, it's Clarence.
At last, we speak.

935
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:45,139
Now, first of all, Lee, I wanna tell you
I'm a real big fan of yours.

936
01:08:45,163 --> 01:08:47,624
That's why I wanna open
"Dr Zhivago" in LA.

937
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:49,749
And I need you and your abilities
to distribute it.

938
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:52,170
Uh, Clarence, uh...

939
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:56,466
I dunno, Clarence. "Dr Zhivago"
is a pretty big movie, you know.

940
01:08:56,674 --> 01:08:58,444
The biggest. The biggest movie
you've ever dealt with, Lee.

941
01:08:58,468 --> 01:08:59,969
We're talking a lot of film, here.

942
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:04,307
A man would have to be an idiot not to be
a little cautious about a movie like that.

943
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:06,351
And, Lee, you are no idiot.

944
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,853
No, no, no. I'm not saying
I'm not interested, Clarence.

945
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,165
It's just that being a distributor
is not what I'm all about.

946
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:12,429
I'm a movie producer, you know?

947
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:15,276
I'm on this earth to make
good movies, nothing more...

948
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:17,195
and nothing, well,
maybe less sometimes.

949
01:09:17,445 --> 01:09:21,199
Hey! Choose a fucking lane!

950
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:24,911
No, not you, just some idiot who...
Don't give me the finger!

951
01:09:25,036 --> 01:09:26,412
I'll fucking have you killed!

952
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:31,084
'So, bottom line is I'm not Paramount.
You know what I'm saying?'

953
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:33,044
I got a select few distributors
I deal with.

954
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:36,130
I buy their little movies and I accomplish
what I wanna accomplish,

955
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:38,735
and get the fuck outta there,
very business-like and very easy,

956
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,301
and very little risk, Clarence.

957
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:41,928
Lee, we're talking "Dr Zhivago".

958
01:09:42,053 --> 01:09:44,097
This'|| be packing them in
for a year and a half.

959
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:47,850
Two years you're not gonna have to deal
with anybody else's movie but mine.

960
01:09:48,059 --> 01:09:51,104
Nobody's but yours?
Well, what's the rush here?

961
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:54,190
I just want to be able to announce
this deal at Cannes, all right?

962
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:56,075
If I had time for a courtship,
Lee, I would.

963
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,953
I'd take you out, I'd hold your hand,
I'd kiss your cheek at the door.

964
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:01,489
But I'm not in that position,
I need to know right now

965
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:03,866
if you and I are in bed together or not.

966
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:06,178
If you want my movie, Lee,
you're gonna have to come to terms

967
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:07,537
with your fear and desire.

968
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:11,165
Uh-huh...
Fear and desire, huh, Clarence?

969
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:16,546
'Don't you know that my films have
grossed more than 2.8 billion, Clarence?

970
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:17,714
'Let me talk to Elliot.'

971
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:20,466
- You wanna talk to Elliot?
- 'Let me talk to Elliot.'

972
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:23,344
Elliot. He wants to talk to you.

973
01:10:25,513 --> 01:10:28,683
- Hi, Lee.
- Elliot, where do you know this guy from?

974
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:31,602
He's a friend of Dick's, remember?

975
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:33,855
'Who the fuck is Dick?'

976
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:40,987
- You want me to suck his dick?
- 'No. Who the fuck is Dick?'

977
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:44,490
Oh, who the fuck is Dick?
Dick is my friend.

978
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:46,775
- He's in my acting class.
- You told him I'm an actor?

979
01:10:46,826 --> 01:10:51,122
Is he any good?
Is he talented? Really?

980
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:55,793
- How does Dick know this guy?
- They grew up together.

981
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:59,464
OK, er... Wednesday at the hotel.
Three o'clock.

982
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:01,189
Bring the whole fucking cast, all right?

983
01:11:01,299 --> 01:11:05,136
Elliot, don't call me here anymore,
especially not on Sunday, all right?

984
01:11:06,137 --> 01:11:09,599
- What did he say?
- OK, hold on... Shut up for a second!

985
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:12,351
Hey, you guys.
This is what's gonna happen.

986
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:16,314
Three o'clock, Beverly Ambassador,
he wants to see everybody. OK?

987
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:20,067
And he'll talk to you.
If after talking to you he likes you,

988
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:21,986
wants to deal with you,
he'll deal with you.

989
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:25,406
If he doesn't, he'll say, "Fuck you,"
and he'll walk out of the room.

990
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:28,034
- Did you tell him I was...?
- Shut up for a second.

991
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:29,994
And he wants a sample bag.

992
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,121
- No problem on all counts.
- Great.

993
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:34,832
Did you tell him I was an actor?

994
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:36,167
Yes, I told him.

995
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:39,045
- You told him I was good?
- Yeah, I lied.

996
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,271
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

997
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:58,564
Oh, pretty good.

998
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:00,775
- You Dick? Dick Ritchie?
- No.

999
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,902
No, he's not here right now.

1000
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:07,365
- You live here?
- Yes, I do.

1001
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:10,743
You're sort of roommates?

1002
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,912
Exactly roommates.

1003
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:15,748
Maybe you can help me,
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

1004
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:17,500
Clarence Worley from Detroit?

1005
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:19,436
He's traveling with a real pretty girl
named Alabama.

1006
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:21,963
Oh, yeah, man, I know 'em.
They've been by here.

1007
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:23,214
- You've seen them?
- Mm-hm.

1008
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,967
- They staying here?
- No, they're staying at the...

1009
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:31,013
Safari Motor... Motel Inn.
Safari Motel.

1010
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:33,766
- Safari Motel?
- Yeah.

1011
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:38,521
How do you know that?
I mean, have you been over there?

1012
01:12:38,646 --> 01:12:44,443
No, they were here, and they said
they were going to go there.

1013
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:46,237
Then they went.

1014
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:49,156
- Yeah?
- Yeah, Safari Motel.

1015
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:50,533
- Safari Motel.
- Uh-huh.

1016
01:12:50,658 --> 01:12:53,786
Hey, you want to watch some TV
or something? They might be back here.

1017
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:55,454
No, no, thank you.
Thank you, though.

1018
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:56,914
OK.

1019
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:00,960
- You take care, I might be back.
- Yeah, man. OK, be cool.

1020
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:09,802
Don't condescend me, man.
I'll fucking kill you, man.

1021
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:18,978
I'm so proud of you.

1022
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,480
- Did I do my part OK?
- Bamalou, you were perfect.

1023
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:23,274
- Like a ninja?
- Like a ninja.

1024
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:25,444
I'm gonna go grab us
something to eat, all right?

1025
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:30,531
I'm gonna go jump in the tub and
get all wet and slippery and soapy.

1026
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:33,784
And hop onto that waterbed
and watch X-rated movies

1027
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:36,329
until you get your ass
back into my loving arms.

1028
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:40,958
Hurry back now.

1029
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:51,302
We now return to "Bullitt"
already in progress.

1030
01:14:03,064 --> 01:14:04,649
Hi.

1031
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:06,692
Hi!

1032
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:19,288
- Cigarette?
- No.

1033
01:14:24,585 --> 01:14:26,295
That's a very nice outfit.

1034
01:14:28,339 --> 01:14:33,594
This?
I got this in Las Vegas, Nevada.

1035
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:48,317
Alabama, where's our coke?
And where's Clarence?

1036
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:50,903
When's he coming back?

1037
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:55,324
I'm sorry, I think you have
the wrong room. My name is Sadie.

1038
01:14:57,451 --> 01:15:01,163
We don't have any Coke, but there's
a Pepsi machine down the hall.

1039
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:04,724
I don't know anybody named Clarence,
but perhaps my husband does.

1040
01:15:04,959 --> 01:15:08,504
You can ask him cos he'll be home
in a minute. He plays football.

1041
01:15:11,716 --> 01:15:13,634
He's just at practice.

1042
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:25,855
- Give me your hand.
- OK.

1043
01:15:32,153 --> 01:15:35,072
You are unbelievably cute.

1044
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:37,575
Thank you. Thanks.

1045
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:42,329
Let me see those eyes.

1046
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:46,751
What a face.

1047
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:52,423
- Do me a favour. Turn around for me.
- OK.

1048
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:55,801
No, go the other way.

1049
01:15:55,926 --> 01:15:57,470
OK.

1050
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:17,156
- Ooh. That hurts, don't it?
- Uh-huh.

1051
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:20,785
Get on your feet, sweetie.
You ain't hurt that bad.

1052
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:25,831
Now, where's our coke?
Where's Clarence?

1053
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:28,375
And when's he coming back?

1054
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:30,377
OK, OK.

1055
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:36,258
Fuck you.

1056
01:16:37,218 --> 01:16:38,636
Fuck me?

1057
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:47,812
What's the matter, baby, huh?

1058
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:50,439
Can't breathe?

1059
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:56,821
You better get used to that.

1060
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:01,450
- Hi.
- Smells like hamburgers in here.

1061
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:04,286
Tell me, what is the biggest,
fattest hamburger you guys got?

1062
01:17:04,495 --> 01:17:06,455
That would be Steve's
Double Chili Cheeseburger.

1063
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:08,791
- Well, give me two of 'em bad boys.
- Uh-huh.

1064
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:12,795
Two chili fries.
And two large diet cokes.

1065
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,213
Anything else?

1066
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:20,469
Come here. Look at yourself! Look!
Take a good look.

1067
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:22,489
You think your boyfriend
would go through this shit?

1068
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:24,849
If you do, you're fucking stupid.
You know that?

1069
01:17:25,599 --> 01:17:29,037
You're a very pretty girl, Alabama, but you
ain't going to be very pretty for very long.

1070
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:34,275
I'm gonna ask you a fucking question,
and you give me the right fucking answer!

1071
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,653
Now... where's my coke?

1072
01:17:44,118 --> 01:17:46,036
Turn around. Turn around!

1073
01:17:47,204 --> 01:17:49,039
Answer me!

1074
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:55,337
Come on.

1075
01:17:59,466 --> 01:18:02,219
You got a lot of heart, kid.

1076
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:09,185
Now, that is a great issue.
You gotten to the story on Elvis yet?

1077
01:18:10,853 --> 01:18:13,314
No. I hadn't.

1078
01:18:13,564 --> 01:18:16,284
That's probably the single best piece
I've ever read on Elvis Presley

1079
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:18,485
in my entire life, look at this.

1080
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:23,908
Look. See, it tries to pin down what
the attraction is after all these years.

1081
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:26,660
It covers the whole spectrum,
talks to the fans,

1082
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:29,121
people who grew up with him,
people who love his music.

1083
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:31,665
Then, there's the fanatics. Right?

1084
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:34,498
I don't know about you,
but they give me the creeps.

1085
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:39,298
- Yeah, yeah, I see what you mean.
- I mean, look at her.

1086
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:43,093
It looks like she fell off the ugly tree
and hit every branch on the way down.

1087
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:54,605
Now, the first time you kill somebody,
that's the hardest.

1088
01:18:56,357 --> 01:18:59,693
I don't give a shit if you're fucking
Wyatt Earp or Jack the Ripper.

1089
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:09,703
Remember that guy in Texas? The guy up in
that fucking tower, killed all them people?

1090
01:19:11,789 --> 01:19:14,750
I bet you green money that first
little black dot he took a bead on

1091
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:17,253
that was the bitch of the bunch.

1092
01:19:19,213 --> 01:19:21,340
First one is tough, no fucking fooling.

1093
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:25,987
The second one ain't no fucking Mardi Gras
either but it's better than the first one,

1094
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:30,182
cos you still feel the same thing,
you know, except it's more diluted.

1095
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:32,351
You know, it's better.

1096
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:35,194
I threw up on the first one,
you believe that?

1097
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:39,400
Then the third one.

1098
01:19:39,525 --> 01:19:42,069
The third one is easy,
you level right off.

1099
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:48,033
That's no problem. Now... shit.

1100
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:52,871
Now I do it just to watch
their fucking expression change.

1101
01:20:01,839 --> 01:20:04,174
I don't fucking believe it.

1102
01:20:05,676 --> 01:20:07,845
Did you put it under the bed?

1103
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:09,388
Uh-huh.

1104
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:14,685
I can't believe it.
You put it under the fucking bed?

1105
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:16,979
I didn't look under the fucking bed.

1106
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:23,654
I can't believe you put it
under the fucking bed.

1107
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:25,880
And I can't believe I didn't look
under the fucking bed.

1108
01:20:25,904 --> 01:20:27,948
I'm getting fucking old!

1109
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:32,661
Ha-ha! Journey's end, baby.
Snow at the end of the rainbow.

1110
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:37,791
One less thing
I gotta fucking worry about.

1111
01:20:48,469 --> 01:20:52,348
This is it, baby.
Moment of truth.

1112
01:21:02,775 --> 01:21:05,277
You got a lot of heart, kid,
you know that?

1113
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:11,408
You wanna play?
Huh? Is that what you want?

1114
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:15,287
You want to play with Daddy?
Come on.

1115
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,932
Come on, I'll give you one shot
because I like you.

1116
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:20,709
Stick it in me, baby.
Come on, stick it in Daddy.

1117
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:24,838
Stick it in me. Go ahead.

1118
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:26,882
Come on, come on! Come on!

1119
01:21:27,508 --> 01:21:29,426
Oh, fuck!

1120
01:21:33,847 --> 01:21:35,182
Ah! Motherfucker!

1121
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:50,739
All right...
no more Mr Fucking-Nice-Guy.

1122
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:52,366
Oh, God!

1123
01:22:00,124 --> 01:22:02,251
What do you think of that? Ha-ha!

1124
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:04,771
What do you think about that, baby?
What do you think about that?

1125
01:22:04,795 --> 01:22:07,714
- Wait! Wait!
- What?

1126
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:13,178
- What the fuck are you laughing at?
- You look ridiculous!

1127
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:20,394
I look fucking ridiculous?
Get up! Laugh it up!

1128
01:22:20,519 --> 01:22:22,062
Come on, laugh it up!

1129
01:22:22,521 --> 01:22:24,523
You were in hysterics a minute ago,
so laugh!

1130
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:26,984
- You like that, don't you?
- Fuck you!

1131
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:30,446
Shit! Fucking cunt!

1132
01:23:29,296 --> 01:23:34,343
Fuck! Motherfucker!
Bama, we gotta go! Jesus Christ!

1133
01:23:34,468 --> 01:23:37,262
Come on, darling.
We gotta get the fuck out of here!

1134
01:23:37,387 --> 01:23:39,515
Come on.

1135
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,440
The cops are gonna be here
any fucking second!

1136
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:46,897
Fuck! Fuck! Come on. Fuck.

1137
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:50,275
I'm sorry. Fuck.

1138
01:24:01,662 --> 01:24:03,914
Fuck! Fuck!

1139
01:24:04,623 --> 01:24:08,335
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1140
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:11,255
Get the fuck out of the way!

1141
01:24:21,848 --> 01:24:24,226
Oh, fuck!

1142
01:24:25,227 --> 01:24:26,562
- Fuck!
- Ow! What?

1143
01:24:26,687 --> 01:24:30,524
I don't fucking believe this!
Goddamn it! I knew it! I fucking knew it!

1144
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:46,456
Oh, fuck, I should have my goddamn
head examined for driving like this.

1145
01:24:46,665 --> 01:24:49,001
Look, Carla... Kandi...

1146
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:51,753
- Kandi, you gotta help me.
- What can I do?

1147
01:24:51,962 --> 01:24:54,881
- Take this. Take this. Hold this.
- What are you? High? No.

1148
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:58,069
- Fucking put this in your purse.
- I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.

1149
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:01,281
He's not going to search you, you didn't
do anything. Now just put it in your bra!

1150
01:25:01,305 --> 01:25:03,765
- I'm not wearing one.
- Please, please, he's almost here!

1151
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:07,853
- Just fucking put it in your pants!
- No.

1152
01:25:08,395 --> 01:25:12,899
- You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
- Read my lips. No!

1153
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:16,643
- Asshole.
- After all I did for you, you fucking whore!

1154
01:25:16,695 --> 01:25:18,614
Who the fuck do you think you...?

1155
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:25,871
Hi.

1156
01:25:26,913 --> 01:25:30,125
Hey, look, dickhead. It's your bad luck
that we caught you speeding.

1157
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:33,337
And it's your bad luck that
you had a bag of uncut cocaine.

1158
01:25:33,462 --> 01:25:35,797
- Not a tiny little vial.
- A fucking baggy.

1159
01:25:35,922 --> 01:25:37,424
Hey, you got caught.

1160
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:40,153
It's all fun and fucking games,
till you get caught, but now we got you.

1161
01:25:40,177 --> 01:25:42,929
OK, Mr Elliot fucking actor,
you just made the big time.

1162
01:25:43,055 --> 01:25:45,349
- You're no longer an extra.
- Or a bit player.

1163
01:25:45,474 --> 01:25:48,894
- Or a supporting actor.
- You're a fucking star. A fucking star!

1164
01:25:49,019 --> 01:25:53,315
And you'll be playing your one-man show
nightly for the next two fucking years!

1165
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,900
For a captive audience.

1166
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,879
Listen to this. You'll get out in a
few years, you'll meet some old lady.

1167
01:25:57,903 --> 01:26:00,739
You'll get married and you'll be
so understanding to your wife's needs,

1168
01:26:00,864 --> 01:26:02,949
because you'll know
what it feels like to be a woman.

1169
01:26:03,450 --> 01:26:05,261
Of course you'll only wanna fuck her
in the ass

1170
01:26:05,285 --> 01:26:07,221
cos that pussy won't be tight enough
for you anymore.

1171
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:10,707
Good point, Detective.
Right? Fucking faggot!

1172
01:26:11,249 --> 01:26:15,379
Krinkle, this is it, and it's all ours.
I mean, talk about falling into something.

1173
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:18,131
Would the both of you idiots shut up?
I can't understand shit.

1174
01:26:18,256 --> 01:26:20,526
Now, what happened, what's going on?
What are you talking about?

1175
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:21,843
OK, all right.

1176
01:26:21,968 --> 01:26:25,722
Patrol car pulls a guy over for speeding,
right? Suspect's covered with coke.

1177
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:28,201
So they bring the suspect to me and
Nicholson, and we go to work on him.

1178
01:26:28,225 --> 01:26:30,268
Nicholson and I.

1179
01:26:30,394 --> 01:26:33,563
Nicholson, what's the fucking difference?
So, we go to work on the guy, right?

1180
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:36,525
We know something's rotten in Denmark,
cos this guy's fucking stupid,

1181
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:39,778
and he's got a big bag of coke
and it's uncut.

1182
01:26:39,903 --> 01:26:42,155
And you ain't gonna fucking believe
what he's got to say.

1183
01:26:42,364 --> 01:26:44,908
Seems a cop from some department,
we don't know which one,

1184
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:47,869
he stole half a million dollars of coke
from the property cage.

1185
01:26:48,078 --> 01:26:50,118
He'd been sitting on the shit
for a year and a half.

1186
01:26:50,247 --> 01:26:51,727
OK, now, the cop's got this weirdo...

1187
01:26:51,832 --> 01:26:53,667
- Suspect's words.
- Who's a front for him.

1188
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:57,212
So, our guy, Elliot Blitzer, he's making
a deal between them and his boss,

1189
01:26:57,421 --> 01:27:00,632
big-time fucking movie producer
named Lee Donowitz.

1190
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:02,926
He did that movie,
"Coming Home in a Body Bag".

1191
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:04,302
The Vietnam movie?

1192
01:27:04,428 --> 01:27:06,012
- Yeah.
- Good fucking movie.

1193
01:27:06,138 --> 01:27:08,306
Fucking A. Great fucking movie.

1194
01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:11,101
- So, do you believe him?
- I believe he believes him.

1195
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:13,145
This guy's too fucking rattled to be lying.

1196
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:16,940
He'd roll over on his mommy, his daddy,
his granny and the fucking king of Siam

1197
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:19,225
- if he had any on him.
- I mean, this guy was a sissy.

1198
01:27:19,317 --> 01:27:22,904
I mean, he really was, this rabbit
will do anything not to do any time.

1199
01:27:23,029 --> 01:27:25,657
You know what he'll do?
He'll wear a wire.

1200
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:28,952
- He'll wear a wire?
- He'll wear a wire, we talked to him.

1201
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:33,999
Dirty cops... Well, we got
to get Internal Affairs on this.

1202
01:27:34,124 --> 01:27:37,061
I don't give a shit who you bring in. Bring
in the state militia, the LA Thunderbirds,

1203
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:40,338
the ghost of Steve fucking McQueen,
ten fucking Roman gladiators!

1204
01:27:40,464 --> 01:27:43,467
I don't give a shit, as long as me
and Todd get credit for the bust.

1205
01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:46,011
Hey, listen, we found him.
We just want the fucking collar.

1206
01:27:46,136 --> 01:27:47,929
That's it. End of story.

1207
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:51,683
- You got it.
- Fucking A.

1208
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:59,024
Did I ever tell you
how much I hate airports?

1209
01:27:59,149 --> 01:28:00,609
Uh-uh.

1210
01:28:00,734 --> 01:28:04,988
See, I used to live by one
back in Dearborn, you know.

1211
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:08,742
Really frustrating living next
to an airport when you ain't got shit.

1212
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:10,285
Ah...

1213
01:28:12,204 --> 01:28:15,999
And all day long I'm seeing
and hearing people doing exactly

1214
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:18,084
what I want to be doing, but couldn't.

1215
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:19,753
What?

1216
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:26,259
Starting new lives, leaving Detroit,
vacations, business trips...

1217
01:28:27,219 --> 01:28:30,180
- Fun, fun, fun. You all right?
- Mm-hm.

1218
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:37,062
But you and me, we can jump
on any one of those planes out there

1219
01:28:37,187 --> 01:28:39,981
and go anywhere we want.
Gives me a whole new outlook.

1220
01:28:40,106 --> 01:28:41,608
I love airports now.

1221
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:44,402
Yeah, you ain't kidding.
We got lots to start over.

1222
01:28:44,528 --> 01:28:47,072
We should go somewhere
where we can start from scratch.

1223
01:28:48,365 --> 01:28:50,784
I've been in America all my life.

1224
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:53,346
I've always wanted to see
what TV in other countries looks like.

1225
01:28:53,370 --> 01:28:55,914
Where do you think we should go,
my little turtle dove?

1226
01:28:58,583 --> 01:28:59,960
Cancun.

1227
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:02,838
Cancun? Why Cancun?

1228
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:06,633
It's got a nice ring to it.
It sounds like a movie.

1229
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:09,886
"Clarence and Alabama
Go To Cancun", don't you think?

1230
01:29:11,346 --> 01:29:14,182
In my movie, darling,
you get top billing.

1231
01:29:15,725 --> 01:29:20,730
Don't worry about nothing, all right?
It's all gonna work out for us.

1232
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:23,483
We deserve it.

1233
01:29:35,537 --> 01:29:38,137
Now, Floyd, you sure that's how
you get to the Beverly Ambassador?

1234
01:29:38,248 --> 01:29:41,209
Yeah, man, I'm positive.

1235
01:29:41,334 --> 01:29:44,379
Yeah, well, let me just tell you,
if we get lost, that's your ass.

1236
01:29:44,504 --> 01:29:47,883
And, Floyd, why don't you get
out of my beer and get a fucking job?

1237
01:29:48,091 --> 01:29:50,027
- Clarence, can we go?
- We're out the door. We're gone.

1238
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:52,071
We'll meet Elliot in the lobby.
I don't wanna be late.

1239
01:29:52,095 --> 01:29:54,806
Here I go.

1240
01:29:57,309 --> 01:29:58,602
Yes?

1241
01:29:58,727 --> 01:30:01,354
- I'm out, Floyd.
- Are you here? No, he's not here.

1242
01:30:01,563 --> 01:30:03,356
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Come on, Dick!

1243
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:05,609
Just let me hear who it is.

1244
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:07,068
- Hello?
- Fuck.

1245
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:09,487
Hey. Hi, Catherine,
I was just walking out...

1246
01:30:09,696 --> 01:30:11,114
What?

1247
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:14,326
Serious?

1248
01:30:15,201 --> 01:30:17,996
- She said that?
- What did she say? Come on, Dick.

1249
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:22,751
Yo, Catherine,
thank you, thank you.

1250
01:30:22,876 --> 01:30:25,670
I'm gonna talk to you tomorrow.
All right.

1251
01:30:27,464 --> 01:30:29,925
Come on, we gotta go.

1252
01:30:31,635 --> 01:30:33,720
- I got the part.
- Wow!

1253
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:35,013
I got the part!

1254
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:37,724
That's perfect. That's great.
That's wonderful.

1255
01:30:37,849 --> 01:30:39,893
Didn't even want a call-back.

1256
01:30:42,646 --> 01:30:44,856
That's so cool, way to go!

1257
01:30:45,565 --> 01:30:47,776
- I got a seven o'clock call.
- That's great.

1258
01:30:47,901 --> 01:30:51,363
All right, come on, let's go.
I wanna hear all about it, OK? Come on.

1259
01:30:51,488 --> 01:30:54,199
- Hey, Clarence!
- What?

1260
01:30:57,577 --> 01:31:01,623
- Nothing. Forget it.
- All right, come on.

1261
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:06,503
Hey, get some beer!

1262
01:31:07,253 --> 01:31:08,672
And some...

1263
01:31:09,839 --> 01:31:11,883
And some cleaning products!

1264
01:31:23,061 --> 01:31:25,105
I'm losing a fucking fortune over here.

1265
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:35,198
You talking to me,
you fucking wop, you?

1266
01:31:56,886 --> 01:32:00,181
- OK, put your jacket on.
- Put your jacket on.

1267
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:02,100
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1268
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:05,020
Put your jacket on.
One sleeve at a time.

1269
01:32:06,312 --> 01:32:08,273
It's a big game, now, Elliot.

1270
01:32:09,107 --> 01:32:11,860
- It's OK, come on. You all right?
- No.

1271
01:32:12,944 --> 01:32:16,114
Elliot, look at me. Look at me.
You comfortable?

1272
01:32:17,323 --> 01:32:22,620
Am I comfortable?
I've got a, like a brick in my scrotum.

1273
01:32:22,746 --> 01:32:24,497
Elliot, that's the best place for it, OK?

1274
01:32:24,622 --> 01:32:27,022
If they pat you down,
they're not going to search your balls.

1275
01:32:27,083 --> 01:32:29,210
- You think they might see this?
- No, it's OK.

1276
01:32:29,335 --> 01:32:31,129
When you stand up, it'll be OK.

1277
01:32:31,254 --> 01:32:32,380
- Elliot.
- Yeah?

1278
01:32:32,505 --> 01:32:33,882
Say something.

1279
01:32:35,008 --> 01:32:37,343
OK. Hi. How are you?

1280
01:32:37,469 --> 01:32:40,221
My name's Elliot,
and I'm with the Cub Scouts of America.

1281
01:32:40,346 --> 01:32:45,018
We're selling uncut cocaine
to get to the jamboree.

1282
01:32:45,143 --> 01:32:47,353
- Just talk regular, Elliot.
- I'm sorry.

1283
01:32:47,479 --> 01:32:49,647
Stop fucking around.

1284
01:32:49,773 --> 01:32:53,026
- I can't believe I'm doing this.
- You get that shit?

1285
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:56,237
Remember, Elliot, we're gonna be down
the hall monitoring you the whole time.

1286
01:32:56,362 --> 01:32:59,050
Yeah? Well, what happens if somebody
does something that you can't hear

1287
01:32:59,074 --> 01:33:01,284
like pulls out a gun
and puts it to my fucking eye?

1288
01:33:01,409 --> 01:33:04,829
- We've done this a thousand times.
- We know what we're doing, OK?

1289
01:33:04,954 --> 01:33:07,999
We're the best.
Now, listen. No fucking around.

1290
01:33:08,124 --> 01:33:11,086
Anything happens, we'll be in there
like fucking gangbusters, OK?

1291
01:33:11,211 --> 01:33:13,963
Now, you gotta remember something.
You don't wanna go to jail, right?

1292
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:17,050
- Do you wanna go to jail?
- No, I don't wanna go to jail.

1293
01:33:17,133 --> 01:33:21,346
So, what do we got to do?
We got to put your boss in jail, OK?

1294
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:25,558
And to do that, we've gotta show in court,
beyond any reasonable doubt,

1295
01:33:25,683 --> 01:33:28,436
that this man, a very respectable man
in the Hollywood community,

1296
01:33:28,561 --> 01:33:31,648
is also dealing cocaine, we've gotta
prove it in court, and you gotta do it.

1297
01:33:31,773 --> 01:33:35,151
That's what we're doing here. OK? You're
gonna be OK, you're not gonna get hurt.

1298
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:38,863
OK? So what you gotta do
is that you got to get him to admit...

1299
01:33:38,988 --> 01:33:41,074
- On tape, all right?
- Uh-huh.

1300
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:43,493
That he's buying this coke.
OK, champ?

1301
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:45,745
- Get a hold of yourself.
- OK.

1302
01:33:46,329 --> 01:33:48,706
I'm gonna get some coffee.

1303
01:33:52,127 --> 01:33:54,212
Bama, you really got that
playing basketball?

1304
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:57,173
Yes, I got an elbow right in the eye,
then as if that's not enough,

1305
01:33:57,298 --> 01:34:00,927
I got hurled the ball
right when I'm not looking. Wham!

1306
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:03,721
- Right in my face.
- You should be careful.

1307
01:34:04,889 --> 01:34:06,724
I should.

1308
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:21,281
Clarence, what the fuck
did you bring that for?

1309
01:34:21,531 --> 01:34:24,159
- In case.
- In case of what?

1310
01:34:24,284 --> 01:34:26,828
I dunno, what the hell
do you want me to say?

1311
01:34:27,036 --> 01:34:30,039
Look, Clarence,
Lee Donowitz is not a pimp.

1312
01:34:30,248 --> 01:34:33,168
I know that, Richard, but one thing
this last week has taught me,

1313
01:34:33,293 --> 01:34:37,088
it's better to have a gun and not need it
than to need a gun and not have it.

1314
01:34:43,261 --> 01:34:44,804
There he is.

1315
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:57,650
Elliot, your motivation
is to stay out of jail.

1316
01:34:57,775 --> 01:34:59,402
Easy, easy, easy.

1317
01:35:00,028 --> 01:35:02,697
- Hey.
- Hi.

1318
01:35:02,822 --> 01:35:04,782
Hi...

1319
01:35:05,867 --> 01:35:09,329
- I guess it's about that time.
- Yeah.

1320
01:35:09,913 --> 01:35:11,539
Here we go.

1321
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:22,550
You're an actor. Act, motherfucker!

1322
01:35:29,057 --> 01:35:31,017
- Elliot.
- Yeah?

1323
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:34,729
- Get on your knees.
- Oh, no.

1324
01:35:35,647 --> 01:35:36,814
What?

1325
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:38,834
- I said get on your fucking knees!
- Clarence, what the fuck?

1326
01:35:38,858 --> 01:35:41,819
Shut the fuck up, the both of you!
I know what the fuck I'm doing.

1327
01:35:41,945 --> 01:35:44,822
You think I'm pretty fucking stupid,
don't you? Don't you?

1328
01:35:44,948 --> 01:35:47,533
No? Don't you fucking lie to me,
you motherfucker!

1329
01:35:47,742 --> 01:35:50,662
He's bluffing you, Elliot!
He's bluffing you, can't you see that?

1330
01:35:50,787 --> 01:35:53,873
I wanna hear you say it,
"Clarence, you are without a doubt..."

1331
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:56,584
Shut up! Say it, goddamn it,
I wanna hear you say it!

1332
01:35:56,709 --> 01:35:59,420
"Clarence, you are, without a doubt,
the dumbest motherfucker

1333
01:35:59,545 --> 01:36:01,965
"I've ever seen
on the face of the planet." Say it!

1334
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:03,091
Dumb fucker.

1335
01:36:04,717 --> 01:36:07,387
- Apparently, I'm not as dumb...
- He didn't do nothing!

1336
01:36:07,512 --> 01:36:10,431
Apparently, I'm not as dumb
as you fucking think I am, am I?

1337
01:36:10,556 --> 01:36:14,143
What the fuck is waiting for us up there?
What the fuck's waiting for us?

1338
01:36:14,352 --> 01:36:15,395
He's gonna shoot him.

1339
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,915
Tell me, or I'm going to pump two
in your face right here right now.

1340
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:19,649
Ha! He's not gonna shoot him.

1341
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:22,860
- Mother-fuck!
- He's gonna shoot him.

1342
01:36:23,069 --> 01:36:27,198
Like Nick Carter used to say, if I'm wrong,
I swear to God, I'll fucking apologise!

1343
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:29,033
Something's amiss, I can feel it.

1344
01:36:29,158 --> 01:36:32,745
If anything out of the ordinary goes down,
you are gonna be the first one shot!

1345
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:34,390
Clarence, he didn't do anything.
What the fuck...?

1346
01:36:34,414 --> 01:36:37,417
Shut up, all right?
I'm gonna blow this motherfucker away.

1347
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:39,002
FUCK you!

1348
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:42,714
I wish somebody would just come and
get me because I don't like this anymore!

1349
01:36:42,839 --> 01:36:44,882
Get a hold of yourself,
you fucking sissy!

1350
01:36:45,008 --> 01:36:49,595
I really wish somebody would just come
and take me away! Just take me away!

1351
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:51,764
Hang in there, Elliot, goddamn it!

1352
01:36:51,973 --> 01:36:55,184
I can't take this, I'm sorry,
but I just can't!

1353
01:36:55,310 --> 01:37:01,190
And I wish somebody would just come to
my rescue and everything'|| be all right.

1354
01:37:01,399 --> 01:37:04,319
- Elliot. Elliot.
- What?

1355
01:37:04,444 --> 01:37:06,863
I'm sorry, all right?

1356
01:37:07,613 --> 01:37:10,533
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Friends?

1357
01:37:12,618 --> 01:37:14,412
Fuck's with this guy?

1358
01:37:14,537 --> 01:37:16,414
Quit playing around.

1359
01:37:16,539 --> 01:37:19,542
I was playing around,
I just had to be sure. That's all.

1360
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:23,880
I'm sure now, OK? I'm sorry, man.
I didn't mean to scare you.

1361
01:37:24,005 --> 01:37:28,843
Oh, man, I like this Clarence kid,
this fucking guy is crazy!

1362
01:37:39,687 --> 01:37:40,855
Yeah.

1363
01:37:46,027 --> 01:37:47,362
Aw!

1364
01:37:51,282 --> 01:37:52,742
Oh, man.

1365
01:37:56,371 --> 01:37:59,582
- Are you Dick Ritchie?
- Er... no.

1366
01:38:02,335 --> 01:38:05,630
- Do you know a Clarence Worley?
- Yes.

1367
01:38:05,755 --> 01:38:08,758
- Do you know where we can find him?
- Yes, I do.

1368
01:38:12,470 --> 01:38:13,888
Well, where?

1369
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:17,183
At the Beverly Ambassador.

1370
01:38:17,308 --> 01:38:19,435
- Where's that?
- Well...

1371
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:22,814
You go...

1372
01:38:22,939 --> 01:38:25,441
No. Yeah, go down Beach...

1373
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:27,985
You guys wanna smoke a bowl or...?

1374
01:38:29,237 --> 01:38:31,489
Oh. Go down Beachwood

1375
01:38:31,697 --> 01:38:36,119
and drive a while,
and then you gotta turn right, OK?

1376
01:38:36,244 --> 01:38:40,206
And then you go, and you keep driving
and you keep driving.

1377
01:38:47,422 --> 01:38:49,215
- Hello, Elliot.
- Monty.

1378
01:38:50,049 --> 01:38:51,592
Are these your friends?

1379
01:38:51,717 --> 01:38:55,304
Yeah, yeah... you could say that.

1380
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:58,516
- Everybody, this is Monty.
- Hi. Come on in.

1381
01:38:58,724 --> 01:39:00,935
Lee's in the can,
he'll be out in a quick.

1382
01:39:04,313 --> 01:39:06,774
Holy shit, look at this.
Do you believe this?

1383
01:39:06,899 --> 01:39:08,526
It's a helicopter!

1384
01:39:08,651 --> 01:39:11,362
Sorry, nothing personal.

1385
01:39:11,487 --> 01:39:13,197
Clarence...

1386
01:39:15,366 --> 01:39:17,326
There ain't no need
to search me, daredevil.

1387
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:19,620
All you're going to find
is this right here.

1388
01:39:19,745 --> 01:39:21,622
Now, what compelled you
to bring that along?

1389
01:39:21,831 --> 01:39:24,208
I guess the same thing
that compelled you guys

1390
01:39:24,333 --> 01:39:26,836
to bring the heavy artillery
to a business meeting.

1391
01:39:27,044 --> 01:39:29,839
- I'll take that.
- Well, you're gonna have to.

1392
01:39:30,965 --> 01:39:32,925
Oh! Hi.

1393
01:39:33,634 --> 01:39:36,846
Everybody's here.
Elliot, who's who?

1394
01:39:39,348 --> 01:39:42,477
Uh, that's Dick on the end there.

1395
01:39:42,602 --> 01:39:45,563
Oh, that's Dick.
Dick, Elliot tells me you're quite gifted.

1396
01:39:45,688 --> 01:39:49,358
- And, yeah, Alabama in the middle.
- Hello.

1397
01:39:49,484 --> 01:39:51,611
- Clarence on the end.
- Lee, this guy's...

1398
01:39:51,736 --> 01:39:54,947
Boris, please.
I'm meeting people right now, OK?

1399
01:39:55,072 --> 01:39:58,242
- Mr Donowitz...?
- Clarence, don't insult me, call me Lee.

1400
01:39:58,367 --> 01:40:00,453
- Lee...
- Boris, shut the fuck up!

1401
01:40:00,578 --> 01:40:02,806
Come on, everybody, don't be shy.
Come on in. Come on in.

1402
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:04,832
OK, Lee?

1403
01:40:04,957 --> 01:40:06,459
- Lee.
- Lee.

1404
01:40:06,584 --> 01:40:08,127
That's right, Lee.

1405
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:10,338
I just gotta tell you,
I really am a big fan.

1406
01:40:10,463 --> 01:40:13,090
"Coming Home in a Body Bag"
is my favourite movie of all time.

1407
01:40:13,216 --> 01:40:16,511
After "Apocalypse Now", I think
it's the best Vietnam movie ever made.

1408
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:18,513
Wow. Thank you very much,
Clarence.

1409
01:40:18,638 --> 01:40:20,097
- Lee?
- What?

1410
01:40:20,681 --> 01:40:23,851
- This guys packing. "Really?"

1411
01:40:24,602 --> 01:40:27,647
Well, I've been pretty scared
about this whole thing.

1412
01:40:27,772 --> 01:40:30,292
But I'm fairly confident you're just here
to do business, so look...

1413
01:40:30,316 --> 01:40:32,151
I don't wanna be a wise guy or nothing.

1414
01:40:32,276 --> 01:40:35,780
If you want, I'll take my gun, and
I'll lay it on the table. It's up to you.

1415
01:40:38,908 --> 01:40:41,160
No, I don't think that's necessary.

1416
01:40:41,285 --> 01:40:44,080
Boris, be nice.
Make everybody some coffee. OK?

1417
01:40:44,914 --> 01:40:47,017
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

1418
01:40:47,041 --> 01:40:48,918
Honey, sit down. Relax, relax.

1419
01:40:50,169 --> 01:40:52,630
- Elliot, you look like shit.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1420
01:40:52,838 --> 01:40:54,924
It's completely disgusting.

1421
01:40:55,049 --> 01:40:58,386
Er... I need to get a quick signature,
it'd be great...

1422
01:40:58,511 --> 01:41:00,471
Whatever Bonnie wants.

1423
01:41:03,015 --> 01:41:06,727
- Like my dailies, there, Clar?
- Is that what these are? Dailies?

1424
01:41:06,852 --> 01:41:08,396
- You like them?
- Yeah, they're great.

1425
01:41:08,521 --> 01:41:10,523
They better fucking be great,
they cost me enough.

1426
01:41:10,648 --> 01:41:13,651
- What did that day cost me?
- $357,000.

1427
01:41:14,777 --> 01:41:17,238
Elliot, I swear to God,
somebody is stealing from me.

1428
01:41:17,446 --> 01:41:19,782
What's this one called, anyway?

1429
01:41:19,991 --> 01:41:22,118
It's a sequel to "Body Bag".

1430
01:41:22,326 --> 01:41:24,537
- Really?
- We don't have a title yet.

1431
01:41:24,745 --> 01:41:29,041
- What does Joe like?
- Uh, "Body Bags 2".

1432
01:41:29,166 --> 01:41:33,045
Ooh. That's imaginative.
I've got more taste in my penis.

1433
01:41:33,254 --> 01:41:36,716
This guy's really fucking funny.

1434
01:41:36,966 --> 01:41:40,011
Lee, most of these movies that win
a lot of Oscars, I can't stand them.

1435
01:41:40,219 --> 01:41:42,847
They're all safe, geriatric
coffee-table dog-shit, you know?

1436
01:41:43,055 --> 01:41:46,684
We park our cars in the same garage.
It's all right.

1437
01:41:46,809 --> 01:41:50,438
All those assholes make are unwatchable
movies from unreadable books.

1438
01:41:50,563 --> 01:41:52,106
"Mad Max", that's a movie,

1439
01:41:52,231 --> 01:41:53,959
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly",
that's a movie.

1440
01:41:53,983 --> 01:41:55,693
"Rio Bravo", that's a movie.

1441
01:41:55,901 --> 01:41:58,130
And "Coming Home in a Body Bag",
that was a fucking movie.

1442
01:41:58,154 --> 01:42:00,948
It was the only movie at the time
that won a lot of Oscars with balls

1443
01:42:01,073 --> 01:42:03,451
since "Deer Hunter".

1444
01:42:03,576 --> 01:42:05,411
I don't believe you.

1445
01:42:06,579 --> 01:42:09,749
What, do you like a little coffee
with your sugar, or what?

1446
01:42:09,957 --> 01:42:13,252
Lee, I'm not satisfied
till the spoon stands straight up.

1447
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:16,297
Give me a coffee, will you?

1448
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:19,900
Lee, my uncle Roger and my uncle Jerry,
both of whom were in Nam,

1449
01:42:20,051 --> 01:42:21,469
saw "Coming Home in a Body Bag".

1450
01:42:21,594 --> 01:42:24,114
They said to me, Clarence, that's
the most accurate Vietnam film

1451
01:42:24,221 --> 01:42:25,848
they'd ever seen.

1452
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:28,243
I'll tell you something, Clarence,
when veterans in that bullshit war

1453
01:42:28,267 --> 01:42:33,397
say that about my project, it makes
the whole thing worthwhile. Here's to you.

1454
01:42:33,522 --> 01:42:35,667
My friend...
I'm calling you my friend, I just met you.

1455
01:42:35,691 --> 01:42:38,819
You know why?
I think cos we got the same interests.

1456
01:42:38,944 --> 01:42:41,405
You know what I'd like to do right now?

1457
01:42:41,530 --> 01:42:43,115
I'd like to see "Dr Zhivago".

1458
01:42:44,784 --> 01:42:48,412
Where is it? Is there a fucking doctor
in the house, or what?

1459
01:42:48,537 --> 01:42:49,747
Hang on a second.

1460
01:42:49,955 --> 01:42:52,267
'Lee, when you see this,
you're gonna shit, I'm telling you.'

1461
01:42:52,291 --> 01:42:54,585
- 'I better.'
- Bingo.

1462
01:42:57,713 --> 01:43:00,007
- What's the guy's name?
- Donowitz.

1463
01:43:14,814 --> 01:43:16,691
Lee, that's all practically uncut.

1464
01:43:16,816 --> 01:43:19,235
If you so desire,
you can cut that a hell of a lot more.

1465
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:20,903
Don't worry, I'll desire.

1466
01:43:21,028 --> 01:43:22,828
Boris, get me another cup of coffee,
will you?

1467
01:43:22,863 --> 01:43:24,365
Me too, Boris.

1468
01:43:24,490 --> 01:43:26,890
I have to hand it to you, Clarence,
this is not nose garbage.

1469
01:43:27,785 --> 01:43:31,497
It's quality stuff.
Perfect merchandise.

1470
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:35,376
The only trouble is whenever I'm offered
a deal that's too good to be true,

1471
01:43:35,501 --> 01:43:37,420
it's because it's a lie.

1472
01:43:46,429 --> 01:43:48,229
Why don't you convince me
you're on the level?

1473
01:43:48,305 --> 01:43:51,392
Convince him. If he don't bite,
we ain't got shit except possession.

1474
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:55,062
Boris, we got all kinds of sandwich shit
back there, make something for somebody.

1475
01:43:55,271 --> 01:43:57,773
We got lean pastrami, nice rye,
anybody want anything?

1476
01:43:57,898 --> 01:44:00,401
- You got any aspirin?
- Yeah, sure. Get him that.

1477
01:44:02,111 --> 01:44:05,197
Well, Lee, it's like this.

1478
01:44:05,781 --> 01:44:09,160
You're getting the bargain of a lifetime
cos I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

1479
01:44:09,285 --> 01:44:12,685
You're used to dealing with professionals,
I'm not a professional, I'm a rank amateur.

1480
01:44:14,123 --> 01:44:16,250
Fuck's going on?
What the fuck's going on, Joe?

1481
01:44:16,459 --> 01:44:21,088
I can take that, sell it a little bit at a
time and make a hell of a lot more money.

1482
01:44:21,297 --> 01:44:24,383
- What's going on, Joe?
- Elliot's too far away.

1483
01:44:24,508 --> 01:44:27,178
Look, this is the whole ball game,
the fucking game, this is it!

1484
01:44:27,303 --> 01:44:29,823
I'm not a drug dealer,
I'm not saying that you're a drug dealer,

1485
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:31,599
but you're a fucking movie producer.

1486
01:44:31,724 --> 01:44:34,084
And you got access to all kinds
of money and shit like that.

1487
01:44:34,185 --> 01:44:39,190
Shit.
Oh, Joe, you're fucking killing me.

1488
01:44:39,315 --> 01:44:40,566
- Joe?
- Wait, shh!

1489
01:44:40,775 --> 01:44:43,527
Now, I cannot get a million for it,
but you can, all right?

1490
01:44:43,652 --> 01:44:47,656
So I'll sell it to you for $200,000.
You go make a million with it.

1491
01:44:48,657 --> 01:44:51,035
Shit, it's all found money to me
anyway, you know?

1492
01:44:51,285 --> 01:44:52,745
There he is.

1493
01:44:56,165 --> 01:44:59,001
Me and my wife,
we're minimum-wage kids.

1494
01:44:59,126 --> 01:45:01,545
$200,000, it means the world to us.

1495
01:45:03,255 --> 01:45:05,925
Elliot tells me that
you're fronting for a dirty cop.

1496
01:45:08,135 --> 01:45:10,346
Elliot wasn't supposed
to tell you anything.

1497
01:45:10,471 --> 01:45:12,932
He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop.

1498
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:15,351
He saw his chance
and he took it, that's all.

1499
01:45:15,476 --> 01:45:17,686
Why does he trust you?

1500
01:45:17,812 --> 01:45:20,523
Well, we grew up together, that's why.

1501
01:45:20,648 --> 01:45:26,320
Clarence... if you don't know shit, then
why does he think that you can sell it?

1502
01:45:28,197 --> 01:45:29,949
I bullshitted him.

1503
01:45:34,245 --> 01:45:35,329
You are nuts!

1504
01:45:35,579 --> 01:45:38,582
He's a wild man, this kid, Clarence.
I like him.

1505
01:45:38,707 --> 01:45:40,584
- You're wild, I love it.
- Hey, Lee.

1506
01:45:41,335 --> 01:45:44,713
I love this guy, he bullshitted him,
you believe this kid? I love him.

1507
01:45:44,839 --> 01:45:47,299
'Elliot, I love this kid.
Monty, get the money.'

1508
01:45:47,550 --> 01:45:49,885
That's it, fellas,
let's get these sons of bitches.

1509
01:45:52,429 --> 01:45:54,932
Now, wait, wait.
I completely forgot, excuse me.

1510
01:45:55,057 --> 01:45:57,810
- What's your part in this again?
- I'm his wife.

1511
01:45:57,935 --> 01:46:00,855
Oh, you're the wife, right.
Clarence, Clarence.

1512
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:04,400
- What, did you beat her or something?
- No, no, she got that playing basketball.

1513
01:46:07,069 --> 01:46:08,904
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm sorry.

1514
01:46:09,029 --> 01:46:11,782
- Why are you here?
- I'm an actor.

1515
01:46:11,907 --> 01:46:15,786
Dick, if you were just a fucking actor,
you never would've got in the room.

1516
01:46:16,745 --> 01:46:18,455
I'm friends with Elliot.

1517
01:46:18,664 --> 01:46:21,500
He's your friend? You got problems.

1518
01:46:21,625 --> 01:46:24,086
All right, all right.
It's all right. And Elliot knows me.

1519
01:46:24,211 --> 01:46:26,922
Elliot, here. Call Joe.

1520
01:46:27,047 --> 01:46:29,258
Tell that cocksucker that
the production manager reports

1521
01:46:29,383 --> 01:46:33,971
that he's taking 30 cents of every dollar
and putting it in his own pocket.

1522
01:46:34,179 --> 01:46:35,931
Don't you want to count your money?

1523
01:46:36,849 --> 01:46:39,077
No, that's all right, she can count it.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

1524
01:46:39,101 --> 01:46:40,102
Give it to her.

1525
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:45,733
♪ Well, since my baby left me

1526
01:46:45,858 --> 01:46:48,027
♪ I found a new place to dwell

1527
01:46:48,152 --> 01:46:53,073
♪ It's down at the end of Lonely Street
at Heartbreak Hotel... ♪

1528
01:46:53,198 --> 01:46:55,159
I gotta hand it to you, Clarence.

1529
01:46:55,284 --> 01:46:57,703
- I was cool?
- Man, you were cooler than cool.

1530
01:46:57,953 --> 01:47:00,915
- Oh, my God, I forgot my fucking vest.
- Stupid.

1531
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:02,458
- Cody, on three.
- Yeah.

1532
01:47:02,583 --> 01:47:05,794
One. Two. Three.

1533
01:47:06,003 --> 01:47:07,630
Police! Police!

1534
01:47:08,756 --> 01:47:11,592
- Put your guns down!
- Get down on the floor!

1535
01:47:13,802 --> 01:47:17,723
- Drop your gun!
- Drop your guns and back away!

1536
01:47:17,848 --> 01:47:20,184
Both of you put the fucking guns
on the floor now!

1537
01:47:20,392 --> 01:47:23,896
Fuck you! All you pigs, put your guns
on the floor and back away.

1538
01:47:24,104 --> 01:47:25,824
Are you fucking nuts?
Just do what they say.

1539
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:28,820
- This is your last fucking chance.
- Fuck you, this is your last chance!

1540
01:47:29,026 --> 01:47:31,111
We could kill all of you
and you fucking know it!

1541
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:35,157
- Now get down on the fucking floor!
- Boris! Shut the fuck up.

1542
01:47:35,282 --> 01:47:37,076
We're all going to die here,
these are cops!

1543
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:38,827
So, they're cops.
Who gives a shit?

1544
01:47:38,953 --> 01:47:42,498
Hey, Lee, something I never told you
about me. I hate fucking cops!

1545
01:47:42,623 --> 01:47:44,375
All right,
let's be nice, guys, come on.

1546
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:47,252
- We don't wanna die.
- No, I certainly don't wanna die.

1547
01:47:47,378 --> 01:47:50,714
You look like a blond Frankenstein.
Now put your gun down, you son of a bitch!

1548
01:47:52,883 --> 01:47:55,052
- 211?
- Yeah, 211.

1549
01:47:57,179 --> 01:47:59,181
There you go, Mad Dog.

1550
01:48:08,691 --> 01:48:11,568
- Holy shit.
- Motherfucker.

1551
01:48:11,777 --> 01:48:15,906
Who are these guys?
Put your fucking guns down! Put them down!

1552
01:48:16,156 --> 01:48:18,242
Put them down, motherfucker!
Put them down!

1553
01:48:18,492 --> 01:48:22,579
- Fuck you!
- Put the fucking guns down!

1554
01:48:23,664 --> 01:48:26,083
How do you really think
I'm doing with Lee?

1555
01:48:26,291 --> 01:48:28,210
Are you kidding, man?
He loves you.

1556
01:48:28,335 --> 01:48:30,480
You don't think I'm kissing his ass
or anything, do you?

1557
01:48:30,504 --> 01:48:34,216
You're telling him what he wants to hear.
That ain't the same as kissing his ass.

1558
01:48:34,466 --> 01:48:38,512
Yeah, I saw "Coming Home in a Body Bag",
I loved it, I'm not lying to the guy.

1559
01:48:38,637 --> 01:48:41,432
No, that's why
it ain't ass-kissing.

1560
01:48:41,557 --> 01:48:44,977
What you're doing is genuine.
And he knows it.

1561
01:48:48,605 --> 01:48:50,566
I like you, Clarence.

1562
01:48:50,691 --> 01:48:52,443
Always have.

1563
01:48:52,568 --> 01:48:54,111
Always will.

1564
01:48:59,199 --> 01:49:03,912
- Put them down now!
- Put them down!

1565
01:49:04,163 --> 01:49:06,373
Put those guns down, motherfuckers!

1566
01:49:07,958 --> 01:49:10,627
Officer Dimes. Officer Dimes?

1567
01:49:10,836 --> 01:49:13,047
Put them down,
motherfucker! Put them down!

1568
01:49:14,381 --> 01:49:16,258
- Officer Dimes?
- What?

1569
01:49:16,383 --> 01:49:18,469
Officer Dimes?

1570
01:49:18,594 --> 01:49:20,137
- Officer Dimes?
- What?

1571
01:49:20,387 --> 01:49:23,724
Er... this has nothing to do with me
anymore, right?

1572
01:49:23,849 --> 01:49:26,810
OK. So, I'm just gonna leave.

1573
01:49:26,935 --> 01:49:29,080
And you guys just settle this
by yourselves, all right?

1574
01:49:29,104 --> 01:49:30,939
Just shut up
and stay the fuck put, Elliot!

1575
01:49:31,940 --> 01:49:33,776
How do you know his name?

1576
01:49:33,984 --> 01:49:36,070
Why the fuck did he know your name?

1577
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:39,364
You little piece of shit!

1578
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:42,177
You can forget about acting
for the next 20 years!

1579
01:49:42,201 --> 01:49:46,080
Your fucking career is over!
Take your fucking SAG card and burn it!

1580
01:49:46,330 --> 01:49:48,832
You little cocksucker!

1581
01:49:48,957 --> 01:49:52,878
I treated you like a son!
You fucking stabbed me in the heart!

1582
01:49:53,003 --> 01:49:55,380
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

1583
01:49:55,589 --> 01:49:58,175
Motherfucker, don't touch him!
Motherfucker!

1584
01:49:59,051 --> 01:50:00,051
FUCK you!

1585
01:50:05,265 --> 01:50:06,308
Cody!

1586
01:50:32,459 --> 01:50:35,045
Clarence!

1587
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:53,063
Please!

1588
01:51:14,084 --> 01:51:15,169
Sweetie!

1589
01:51:16,211 --> 01:51:17,546
Sweetie!

1590
01:51:20,716 --> 01:51:22,634
Baby!

1591
01:51:22,759 --> 01:51:25,721
OK, you with the shotgun,
behind the couch! Come out!

1592
01:51:28,056 --> 01:51:29,224
The guy's a Wop.

1593
01:51:30,809 --> 01:51:33,437
I said, come out from behind the couch,
you fucking guinea. Now!

1594
01:51:36,481 --> 01:51:39,943
I said to come-a out-a from
behind the couch-o. OK? Capisce?

1595
01:51:40,194 --> 01:51:41,945
Wait.

1596
01:51:42,779 --> 01:51:44,448
Nice and slow!

1597
01:51:44,656 --> 01:51:46,033
One moment.

1598
01:51:54,583 --> 01:51:57,252
Shit! The guy hit me.

1599
01:52:07,262 --> 01:52:09,014
Son of a bitch shot me.

1600
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:12,809
Sweetie!

1601
01:52:13,852 --> 01:52:16,772
Don't you die on me!

1602
01:52:20,692 --> 01:52:22,945
You're gonna be OK.

1603
01:52:23,070 --> 01:52:25,447
I need an ambulance!

1604
01:52:26,448 --> 01:52:28,450
I need an ambulance!

1605
01:52:40,837 --> 01:52:44,258
Fuck you! I'll blow this bitch's brains
to kingdom come!

1606
01:52:49,346 --> 01:52:51,974
- I need an ambulance!
- Shut up.

1607
01:52:53,433 --> 01:52:57,104
- Fuck you, I'm bleeding!
- I'll call you a hearse.

1608
01:52:58,981 --> 01:53:00,524
This is for Cody.

1609
01:53:03,485 --> 01:53:04,611
FUCK you!

1610
01:53:51,867 --> 01:53:54,036
Honey, you're alive!

1611
01:53:57,414 --> 01:53:59,333
I can't see.

1612
01:54:01,877 --> 01:54:05,714
Honey, you have blood in your eye.
Come on.

1613
01:54:07,007 --> 01:54:08,842
Hold on. OK...
