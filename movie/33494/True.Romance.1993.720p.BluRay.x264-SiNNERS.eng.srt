1
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,395
In Jailhouse Rock,
he was everything rockabilly is about.

2
00:01:16,896 --> 00:01:18,898
I mean he is rockabilly:

3
00:01:19,857 --> 00:01:22,193
Mean, surly, nasty, rude.

4
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:25,822
In that movie, he couldn't give a fuck
about nothin'.

5
00:01:25,905 --> 00:01:28,699
Except rocking and rolling,
living fast, dying young...

6
00:01:28,783 --> 00:01:31,160
and leaving a good-looking corpse.

7
00:01:34,997 --> 00:01:37,959
I watch that hillbilly
and I want to be him so bad.

8
00:01:40,002 --> 00:01:41,462
Elvis looked good.

9
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:46,968
Hey, I'm no fag.
But Elvis was prettier than most women.

10
00:01:47,135 --> 00:01:48,719
You know? Most women.

11
00:01:52,974 --> 00:01:56,644
You know I always said,
if I had to fuck a guy. I mean had to...

12
00:01:56,727 --> 00:01:58,771
and my life depended on it...

13
00:02:00,022 --> 00:02:01,440
I'd fuck Elvis.

14
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:04,318
I'd fuck Elvis.

15
00:02:06,988 --> 00:02:07,989
Really?

16
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:10,449
Well, when he was alive, not now.

17
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:13,244
I don't blame you.

18
00:02:13,327 --> 00:02:15,204
So, we'd both fuck Elvis.

19
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:19,834
It's nice to meet people
with common interests, ain't it?

20
00:02:22,837 --> 00:02:25,381
Well, enough about the King.
How about you?

21
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,968
How about me what?

22
00:02:31,387 --> 00:02:34,140
How about you go to the movies
with me tonight?

23
00:02:35,766 --> 00:02:37,393
What are we gonna see?

24
00:02:38,186 --> 00:02:40,146
A Sonny Chiba triple feature.

25
00:02:40,313 --> 00:02:42,690
The Streetfighter,
Return of the Streetfighter...

26
00:02:42,815 --> 00:02:44,734
and Sister Streetfighter.

27
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:46,861
Who's Sonny Chiba?

28
00:02:47,612 --> 00:02:49,155
"Who's Sonny Chiba?"

29
00:02:49,405 --> 00:02:53,743
Well, he is, bar none, the finest actor
working in martial arts movies today.

30
00:02:54,994 --> 00:02:57,371
You want to take me to a kung fu movie?

31
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,459
Three kung fu movies.

32
00:03:06,088 --> 00:03:08,049
I don't think so.

33
00:03:09,425 --> 00:03:11,427
Not really my cup of tea.

34
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,930
All right.

35
00:04:53,404 --> 00:04:56,699
I had to come all the way
from the highways and byways...

36
00:04:56,908 --> 00:04:58,826
of Tallahassee, Florida...

37
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,662
to Motor City, Detroit
to find my true love.

38
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,458
If you gave me a million years to ponder...

39
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,129
I would never have guessed that true
romance and Detroit would go together.

40
00:05:11,297 --> 00:05:15,343
And to this day, the events that followed
all seem like a distant dream.

41
00:05:15,968 --> 00:05:17,970
But the dream was real...

42
00:05:18,513 --> 00:05:20,890
and was to change our lives forever.

43
00:05:24,268 --> 00:05:27,855
I kept asking Clarence why our world
seemed to be collapsing...

44
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:29,982
and everything was so shitty.

45
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:31,943
And he'd say:

46
00:05:32,527 --> 00:05:35,238
"That's the way it goes. But don't forget...

47
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,782
"...it goes the other way too".

48
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:41,160
That's the way romance is.

49
00:05:42,328 --> 00:05:44,330
Usually that's the way it goes.

50
00:05:44,997 --> 00:05:49,085
But every once in a while,
it goes the other way too.

51
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:57,760
My heart beats and there is time.

52
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:18,156
Don't move, Tojo.

53
00:06:19,657 --> 00:06:21,659
You'll be unconscious soon....

54
00:06:21,742 --> 00:06:23,119
It's an ancient technique.

55
00:06:23,202 --> 00:06:24,704
Oxygen.

56
00:06:26,122 --> 00:06:26,998
Come.

57
00:06:32,712 --> 00:06:35,465
Oh, look what happened!
Oh, God, I am so sorry.

58
00:06:35,965 --> 00:06:38,509
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

59
00:06:38,634 --> 00:06:41,554
Oh, Jesus, I am the clumsiest person
in the world.

60
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:43,931
That's all right. Accidents happen.

61
00:06:44,932 --> 00:06:47,894
What a wonderful philosophy.
Thanks for being a sweetheart.

62
00:06:47,977 --> 00:06:50,313
Because you could have been a real dick.

63
00:06:50,396 --> 00:06:51,731
Come on! Ready?

64
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,860
Larry, where are we going?

65
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:09,707
Look, we don't know
what will be coming next.

66
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:12,877
You mean you're scared?

67
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,879
Hey, laundromat clothes!

68
00:07:15,671 --> 00:07:17,173
You mind if I smoke?

69
00:07:17,924 --> 00:07:19,008
No.

70
00:07:19,675 --> 00:07:22,678
Listen, do you mind filling me in
on what I missed?

71
00:07:23,095 --> 00:07:24,680
No, no.

72
00:07:27,183 --> 00:07:30,937
See this, that guy up there?
It's Sonny Chiba.

73
00:07:31,562 --> 00:07:32,730
The Oriental?

74
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:34,941
Yeah, the one in black.

75
00:07:36,442 --> 00:07:37,860
You want a Goober?

76
00:07:38,903 --> 00:07:43,574
Yeah. See, in the beginning of the movie
he was hired to get this guy.

77
00:07:43,783 --> 00:07:45,868
You have got popcorn all over you.

78
00:07:45,952 --> 00:07:47,703
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

79
00:07:49,956 --> 00:07:51,999
Is he supposed to be a good guy?

80
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:55,878
He ain't so much a good guy
as he's just a bad motherfucker.

81
00:07:55,962 --> 00:07:59,298
I mean, he gets paid by people
to fuck guys up. You know.

82
00:08:04,637 --> 00:08:07,098
You came to see three kung fu movies?

83
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:09,058
Sure, why not?

84
00:08:09,725 --> 00:08:13,396
Nothing, nothing. You're a girl
after my own heart. That's all.

85
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:15,648
Do you know what time it is?

86
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,817
It's about 12:00.

87
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:20,945
I suppose you've got to get up early, huh?

88
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,698
No, not particularly, how come?

89
00:08:25,324 --> 00:08:28,327
It's just, after a movie,
I like to go get some pie...

90
00:08:28,411 --> 00:08:29,495
and talk about it.

91
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:31,289
Sort of a little tradition I have.

92
00:08:31,998 --> 00:08:34,917
Do you like to get pie
after you see a good movie?

93
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:38,045
Yeah, I love to get pie after a movie.

94
00:08:39,755 --> 00:08:42,300
Would you like to go
get some pie with me?

95
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:44,969
I'd love some pie.

96
00:08:50,349 --> 00:08:52,810
In that movie, he couldn't give a fuck
about nothing.

97
00:08:52,935 --> 00:08:55,313
Except rock-and-roll, living fast,
dying young...

98
00:08:55,438 --> 00:08:57,773
and leaving a good-looking corpse.

99
00:08:58,816 --> 00:09:01,277
Enough about the King. How about you?

100
00:09:01,777 --> 00:09:03,196
How about me what?

101
00:09:04,071 --> 00:09:05,990
Well, tell me about yourself.

102
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:08,075
What do you want to know?

103
00:09:09,076 --> 00:09:12,914
Well, for starters, what do you do?
Where are you from?

104
00:09:12,997 --> 00:09:15,958
What's your favorite color?
Who's your favorite movie star?

105
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:17,752
What kind of music do you like?

106
00:09:17,835 --> 00:09:20,213
What are your turn-ons, your turnoffs?

107
00:09:20,713 --> 00:09:23,591
I guess the big question is,
do you have a fella?

108
00:09:25,176 --> 00:09:27,178
Okay, ask me again, one by one.

109
00:09:28,095 --> 00:09:29,263
What do you do?

110
00:09:29,347 --> 00:09:30,431
I don't remember.

111
00:09:30,556 --> 00:09:32,141
- Where are you from?
- I don't know.

112
00:09:32,225 --> 00:09:35,436
- What's your favorite color?
- I don't know. Black?

113
00:09:36,604 --> 00:09:39,398
- Well, who's your favorite movie star?
- Burt Reynolds.

114
00:09:39,482 --> 00:09:41,317
Do you want a bite of my pie?

115
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,361
Yes, I would. A little one.

116
00:09:43,611 --> 00:09:44,695
All right.

117
00:09:46,072 --> 00:09:49,617
You all right? It's good. You like it?

118
00:09:51,369 --> 00:09:52,703
What kind of music do you like?

119
00:09:52,787 --> 00:09:55,748
Phil Spector. Girl-group stuff like,
He is a Rebel.

120
00:09:55,832 --> 00:09:57,542
What are your turn-ons?

121
00:09:59,418 --> 00:10:03,756
Mickey Rourke, a man who can appreciate
the finer things in life, like sugar.

122
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:07,635
Elvis' voice, kung fu, pie.

123
00:10:08,094 --> 00:10:09,178
Turnoffs?

124
00:10:10,555 --> 00:10:11,639
Turnoffs.

125
00:10:13,432 --> 00:10:14,767
Persians.

126
00:10:17,854 --> 00:10:19,397
Do you have a fella?

127
00:10:21,065 --> 00:10:23,234
Ask me that one a little bit later.

128
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:28,489
In a theater full of empty seats,
why did you sit by me?

129
00:10:30,324 --> 00:10:32,493
Because you looked like a nice guy.

130
00:10:34,454 --> 00:10:36,998
So I had to dump my popcorn all over you.

131
00:10:40,918 --> 00:10:43,087
I'll get the check. Where to next?

132
00:10:44,172 --> 00:10:45,339
Can I peek?

133
00:10:45,673 --> 00:10:47,967
Now don't peek. Keep your eyes shut.

134
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:52,472
All right, I am turning the lights on.
Okay, open them.

135
00:10:53,181 --> 00:10:54,765
Oh, wow!

136
00:10:55,641 --> 00:10:58,436
Wow, what a swell place to work!

137
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:01,272
Yeah, it's cool. I got the keys...

138
00:11:01,355 --> 00:11:04,484
so I just come in, you know,
read comics, play music.

139
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:06,444
You worked here a long time?

140
00:11:06,527 --> 00:11:07,945
Almost four years.

141
00:11:09,322 --> 00:11:10,573
That is a long time.

142
00:11:10,698 --> 00:11:12,492
Yeah, but it's not so bad.

143
00:11:12,575 --> 00:11:15,036
I'm pretty friendly
with most of the customers.

144
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:17,872
So I just hang out, bullshit,
read comic books.

145
00:11:17,955 --> 00:11:19,415
You get paid a lot?

146
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,377
No, that's where the trouble
comes into paradise.

147
00:11:23,544 --> 00:11:25,421
The boss is a pretty nice guy.

148
00:11:25,505 --> 00:11:29,008
He lets you borrow money
from time to time, if you need it.

149
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,807
You want to see what
Spiderman No. 1 looks like?

150
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:36,891
You bet.

151
00:11:38,476 --> 00:11:41,687
Just great stories, great characters,
beautiful artwork.

152
00:11:42,146 --> 00:11:44,607
See, in this one, Nick,
he's gotten this ring here...

153
00:11:44,732 --> 00:11:48,402
for his sweetheart and he wears it
around his neck on a chain.

154
00:11:48,611 --> 00:11:52,615
And later on in the story,
he gets in this fight with this Nazi bastard.

155
00:11:52,698 --> 00:11:54,700
And the Kraut grabs hold of the chain.

156
00:11:54,784 --> 00:11:56,786
Well, the ring goes overboard.

157
00:11:59,872 --> 00:12:02,333
Nick, he dives into the ocean to get it.

158
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,253
Isn't that cool?

159
00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:52,109
What is it? You're crying?
What did I do? Did I do something?

160
00:13:52,193 --> 00:13:53,778
You didn't do nothing.

161
00:13:53,903 --> 00:13:55,071
What is it?

162
00:13:57,198 --> 00:13:59,367
I have something I got to tell you.

163
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:06,165
I didn't just happen to be at that theater.
I was paid to be there.

164
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:11,212
If you were paid to be there, what are you?
A theater-checker?

165
00:14:11,295 --> 00:14:14,841
You get paid to check the box-office girls
aren't ripping the place off?

166
00:14:14,924 --> 00:14:17,385
I'm no theater-checker. I'm a call girl.

167
00:14:19,762 --> 00:14:21,097
You're a whore?

168
00:14:21,472 --> 00:14:24,809
No! I'm a call girl,
and there is a difference, you know!

169
00:14:26,644 --> 00:14:30,398
Okay, here it goes. You know the place
you took me to last night?

170
00:14:30,815 --> 00:14:32,275
The place you work.

171
00:14:32,608 --> 00:14:33,776
Heroes for Sale?

172
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,444
You got a boss, right?

173
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,571
Yeah.

174
00:14:36,946 --> 00:14:38,197
Okay, what's his name?

175
00:14:38,322 --> 00:14:39,323
Lance.

176
00:14:39,866 --> 00:14:42,160
That's him.
He called the place where I work.

177
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:44,704
He ordered a girl.
He wanted you to get laid.

178
00:14:44,787 --> 00:14:48,374
Said you didn't get out much,
and it was your birthday and all.

179
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:52,336
He wanted me to act like I just showed up.

180
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,214
How did he know you were going to be
at that theater?

181
00:14:55,298 --> 00:14:57,967
I go to the movies every year
on my birthday.

182
00:14:58,176 --> 00:15:01,804
He called me this week to find out
what my birthday movie was going to be.

183
00:15:01,888 --> 00:15:03,139
You're not mad?

184
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,184
No, man. I can't tell you....

185
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:08,769
That was one of the best times I ever had.

186
00:15:08,895 --> 00:15:12,106
It was. You know, I knew something
must be rotten in Denmark.

187
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,525
There's no way you could like me
that much.

188
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:17,778
I was so relieved
when you took off your dress...

189
00:15:17,862 --> 00:15:19,113
and didn't have a dick.

190
00:15:19,238 --> 00:15:21,532
Stop being so fucking calm about all this!

191
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:23,743
Look in your house.
There's a note on your TV.

192
00:15:23,826 --> 00:15:26,913
It only says "Dear Clarence,"
because I couldn't write anymore.

193
00:15:26,996 --> 00:15:29,332
So I just said, "Alabama, come clean.

194
00:15:29,415 --> 00:15:31,584
"Just tell him what's what.
If he tells you...

195
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:33,920
"...to go back to Drexl and fuck yourself...

196
00:15:34,003 --> 00:15:36,380
"...then go back to Drexl
and fuck yourself".

197
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:38,132
Drexl? What's a Drexl?

198
00:15:38,216 --> 00:15:40,343
Please shut up! I'm trying to come clean.

199
00:15:40,426 --> 00:15:44,263
I've been a call girl for exactly four days
and you are my third customer.

200
00:15:44,388 --> 00:15:47,225
I want you to know,
that I am not damaged goods.

201
00:15:47,517 --> 00:15:50,144
I'm not what they call in Florida,
white trash!

202
00:15:50,228 --> 00:15:51,938
I'm a really good person.

203
00:15:52,438 --> 00:15:54,732
And when it comes to relationships...

204
00:15:55,441 --> 00:15:57,360
I am one hundred percent.

205
00:15:58,903 --> 00:16:02,156
I am one hundred percent monogamous.

206
00:16:04,116 --> 00:16:05,743
You stay with one guy?

207
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:09,539
Exactly. If I'm with you, then I'm with you.

208
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:12,041
And I don't want anybody else.

209
00:16:14,585 --> 00:16:16,963
Now, I got to tell you something else.

210
00:16:17,338 --> 00:16:20,550
When you said last night was one
of the best times you've had...

211
00:16:20,633 --> 00:16:22,468
did you mean physically?

212
00:16:22,844 --> 00:16:25,888
Yeah, yeah. But I'm talking about
the whole night.

213
00:16:26,472 --> 00:16:30,143
I never had as much fun with a girl,
as I had with you, my whole life.

214
00:16:30,268 --> 00:16:33,688
It's true. You like Elvis. You like Janis...

215
00:16:33,938 --> 00:16:37,441
you like kung fu movies.
You like The Partridge Family....

216
00:16:37,817 --> 00:16:41,279
Actually, I don't like The Partridge family.

217
00:16:41,946 --> 00:16:43,698
That was part of the act.

218
00:16:49,245 --> 00:16:51,581
And I feel really goofy saying this...

219
00:16:51,956 --> 00:16:56,627
after only knowing you one night,
and me being a call girl and all....

220
00:16:58,796 --> 00:17:00,465
But, I think I love you.

221
00:17:07,972 --> 00:17:09,223
Wait a second.

222
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:15,730
Look, I've been trying to keep
this whole thing in perspective.

223
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,901
You just said you loved me. If I say
I love you, throw caution to the wind...

224
00:17:20,026 --> 00:17:23,529
let the chips fall as they may,
and you're lying, I'll fucking die.

225
00:17:23,613 --> 00:17:27,366
I'm not lying to you.
And I swear from this moment forth...

226
00:17:28,326 --> 00:17:30,495
I will never lie to you again.

227
00:17:43,925 --> 00:17:45,551
Well, hello, Mrs. Worley.

228
00:17:45,635 --> 00:17:47,053
How do you do, Mr. Worley.

229
00:17:47,136 --> 00:17:49,096
Top of the morning to you, Mrs. Worley.

230
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,973
Bottom of the ninth, Mr. Worley.

231
00:17:51,057 --> 00:17:53,434
By the way, have you seen
your lovely wife today?

232
00:17:53,518 --> 00:17:55,603
My beautiful, charming, sexy wife...

233
00:17:55,686 --> 00:17:56,938
Mrs. Alabama Worley?

234
00:17:57,021 --> 00:17:58,815
Are there any others, Mr. Worley?

235
00:17:58,898 --> 00:18:00,066
No, not for me, no.

236
00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:02,151
- No. No.
- Yes, yes.

237
00:18:10,785 --> 00:18:14,789
Excuse me. Do you think you could
turn down the heat just a teeny bit?

238
00:18:18,793 --> 00:18:20,211
I must ask you a question.

239
00:18:20,294 --> 00:18:21,838
Who and what is a Drexl?

240
00:18:21,921 --> 00:18:24,090
- Quiet.
- Huh?

241
00:18:24,674 --> 00:18:25,925
He was my pimp.

242
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:27,802
You had a pimp?

243
00:18:29,595 --> 00:18:31,597
I was a call girl.

244
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:33,432
Call girls have pimps.

245
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:35,184
Was he black?

246
00:18:35,393 --> 00:18:39,397
He thinks he is. He said his mama was
an Apache but I suspect he's lying.

247
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,565
Is he nice?

248
00:18:42,191 --> 00:18:45,945
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
He treated me pretty decent.

249
00:18:46,487 --> 00:18:50,116
I was only there for four days.
He got a little bit rough the other day.

250
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:53,453
- What do you mean? With you?
- No, with my friend Ilene.

251
00:18:53,786 --> 00:18:55,496
What did he do to Ilene?

252
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,790
Slapped her around.
Kicked her in the stomach.

253
00:18:57,874 --> 00:18:59,125
It was scary.

254
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,794
This motherfucker sounds beautiful.

255
00:19:03,296 --> 00:19:06,632
What did you do to end up
with a son of a bitch like that?

256
00:19:10,761 --> 00:19:12,013
What are you talking about?

257
00:19:12,096 --> 00:19:14,265
Floyd say he don't be eating pussy.

258
00:19:15,057 --> 00:19:18,895
Drexl, any nigger says he don't eat pussy's
lying his ass off.

259
00:19:19,145 --> 00:19:20,313
I heard that.

260
00:19:20,396 --> 00:19:23,274
Hold on a second.
Big D., you saying you eat pussy?

261
00:19:23,357 --> 00:19:26,444
Yeah, motherfucker, I eat the pussy,
I eat the bud.

262
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:28,112
I eat every fucking thing.

263
00:19:28,196 --> 00:19:31,741
If I ever did eat any pussy,
I would never eat any pussy, right?

264
00:19:31,824 --> 00:19:34,160
But if I did eat some pussy...

265
00:19:34,243 --> 00:19:36,621
I sure as hell wouldn't tell
no goddamn body.

266
00:19:36,704 --> 00:19:40,541
- I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
- Shit, nigger, you smoke enough Sherm...

267
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:43,336
your dumb ass would do
a lot of motherfucking things.

268
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:46,088
You'd be up in there suckin' niggers' dicks!

269
00:19:48,966 --> 00:19:52,261
Fuck you guys, man.
You guys are fucked up, all right?

270
00:19:52,345 --> 00:19:55,181
Hey. Wait a second.
We's just fucking with you.

271
00:19:56,182 --> 00:20:00,186
In fact, I'm going to show you what
I mean with a little demonstration.

272
00:20:00,394 --> 00:20:01,854
Toss me the burner.

273
00:20:04,982 --> 00:20:06,484
All right, dig this.

274
00:20:08,194 --> 00:20:11,239
Pretend it's that fine centerfold bitch.

275
00:20:12,073 --> 00:20:14,617
You know what I'm saying?
And you are you.

276
00:21:00,872 --> 00:21:02,999
- Honey, where you going?
- Bathroom.

277
00:21:28,774 --> 00:21:31,777
- Well, can you live with it?
- What?

278
00:21:32,195 --> 00:21:33,988
I said can you live with it?

279
00:21:34,071 --> 00:21:34,906
Live with what?

280
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:38,451
That son of a bitch walking around
breathing the same air as you.

281
00:21:38,534 --> 00:21:40,536
Getting away with it every day.

282
00:21:41,788 --> 00:21:43,164
Are you haunted?

283
00:21:43,456 --> 00:21:44,332
Yeah.

284
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:46,834
You want to get un-haunted?

285
00:21:47,668 --> 00:21:48,753
Oh, yeah.

286
00:21:49,003 --> 00:21:50,505
Well, I'd kill him.

287
00:21:51,005 --> 00:21:53,716
Shoot him in the face.
Put him down like a dog.

288
00:21:55,051 --> 00:21:56,594
I can't believe what you're saying.

289
00:21:56,677 --> 00:21:59,514
I'm not saying nothing.
I's just saying what I'd do.

290
00:21:59,597 --> 00:22:00,681
You'd do that?

291
00:22:00,765 --> 00:22:02,767
The fuck don't deserve to live.

292
00:22:04,352 --> 00:22:06,479
Look, he's haunting me, you know.

293
00:22:07,438 --> 00:22:11,067
I want to kill him, but I don't want
to spend the rest of my life in jail.

294
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,610
Hey man, I don't blame you.

295
00:22:12,693 --> 00:22:15,655
- If I thought I'd get away with it....
- Get away with it?

296
00:22:15,738 --> 00:22:19,200
Killing is the hard part.
Getting away with it, that's easy.

297
00:22:19,575 --> 00:22:22,120
You think a cop gives a fuck about a pimp?

298
00:22:23,371 --> 00:22:26,207
Listen.
Every pimp in the world could get shot.

299
00:22:26,457 --> 00:22:30,211
Two in the back of the fucking head.
Cops would throw a party, man.

300
00:22:33,506 --> 00:22:35,967
As long as you're not at the scene
of the crime...

301
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:39,720
with a smoking gun in your hand,
you'll get away with it.

302
00:22:40,304 --> 00:22:41,889
Clarence, I like you.

303
00:22:42,223 --> 00:22:45,351
Always have, always will.

304
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:11,002
'Bama.

305
00:23:12,003 --> 00:23:13,379
Where you going?

306
00:23:15,715 --> 00:23:18,384
I need you to write down
your former address.

307
00:23:18,801 --> 00:23:19,802
Why?

308
00:23:20,052 --> 00:23:22,889
So I can go over there and
pick up your stuff, that's why.

309
00:23:22,972 --> 00:23:26,726
Oh, baby, come on, Clarence.
I just want to disappear from there.

310
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:31,147
I know this scares the shit out of you,
but I'm not scared of that motherfucker.

311
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,984
You are completely out of his reach.
He poses absolutely no threat to you.

312
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:37,028
If he doesn't matter, and he doesn't...

313
00:23:37,111 --> 00:23:40,156
then it seems silly you lose
all your things now.

314
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:41,324
Listen.

315
00:23:42,492 --> 00:23:43,951
You don't know him.

316
00:23:44,035 --> 00:23:47,413
No, you don't know me.
Not when it comes to shit like this.

317
00:23:48,664 --> 00:23:50,082
I need to do this.

318
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:53,961
I want you to know that you can count
on me to protect you.

319
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,509
Come on, please just write it down.

320
00:24:08,184 --> 00:24:09,852
This isn't a good idea.

321
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,522
I'm telling you, it'll be fine.

322
00:24:12,605 --> 00:24:14,524
I'll be in and out of there.

323
00:24:17,276 --> 00:24:18,903
- Be careful.
- I will.

324
00:24:23,866 --> 00:24:25,034
I love you.

325
00:24:25,243 --> 00:24:26,619
I love you, too.

326
00:25:30,224 --> 00:25:31,684
You want something?

327
00:25:32,143 --> 00:25:33,394
Yeah, you Drexl?

328
00:25:33,478 --> 00:25:34,896
No man, I'm Marty.

329
00:25:35,646 --> 00:25:37,356
Well, I want to talk to Drexl.

330
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,359
Well, what the fuck you want
to talk to him about?

331
00:25:40,693 --> 00:25:42,153
It's about Alabama.

332
00:25:57,335 --> 00:25:59,253
He was asking about Alabama.

333
00:26:01,631 --> 00:26:03,466
Where the fuck is that bitch?

334
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:04,801
She's with me.

335
00:26:05,802 --> 00:26:07,345
Who the fuck are you?

336
00:26:07,804 --> 00:26:09,138
I'm her husband.

337
00:26:13,351 --> 00:26:15,812
Well, that makes us practically related.

338
00:26:18,314 --> 00:26:19,398
Have a seat, boy.

339
00:26:19,524 --> 00:26:21,901
Have an egg roll. We got everything here...

340
00:26:21,984 --> 00:26:24,821
from "Little-Eye Joel"
to "Damned if I know".

341
00:26:25,321 --> 00:26:26,405
No, thanks.

342
00:26:30,368 --> 00:26:33,037
No, thanks? What that mean?

343
00:26:35,206 --> 00:26:37,583
I think you're too scared to be eating.

344
00:26:44,382 --> 00:26:45,550
Now, see....

345
00:26:45,675 --> 00:26:48,845
We're sitting down here,
ready to negotiate.

346
00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:52,473
And you've already given up your shit.

347
00:26:52,557 --> 00:26:54,809
I'm still a mystery to you.

348
00:26:54,892 --> 00:26:58,062
But I know exactly where
your white ass is coming from.

349
00:26:58,354 --> 00:27:01,983
If I ask you if you want some dinner
and you grab an egg roll...

350
00:27:02,066 --> 00:27:05,236
I say, he's acting like he ain't got
a care in the world.

351
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:07,989
And who knows? Maybe he don't.

352
00:27:08,072 --> 00:27:12,285
Maybe this fool is such
a bad motherfucker...

353
00:27:12,827 --> 00:27:15,788
he don't have to worry about nothing.
He just sits down...

354
00:27:15,872 --> 00:27:18,040
and watches my motherfucking TV.

355
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:19,333
See?

356
00:27:22,253 --> 00:27:24,213
You haven't even sat down yet.

357
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:27,425
That TV over there,
since you've been here...

358
00:27:27,508 --> 00:27:30,344
has a woman with her breast
just hanging out.

359
00:27:30,595 --> 00:27:33,055
Well, you haven't even bothered to look.

360
00:27:33,514 --> 00:27:35,266
You just been clocking me.

361
00:27:39,645 --> 00:27:44,275
Now, I know I'm pretty.
But I'm not as pretty as a couple of titties.

362
00:27:47,945 --> 00:27:50,114
This child be fierce.

363
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:03,669
I'm not eating because I'm not hungry.

364
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,797
I'm not sitting because I'm not staying.

365
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,717
I'm not looking at the movie because
I've already seen it seven years ago.

366
00:28:09,801 --> 00:28:10,885
It is The Mack.

367
00:28:10,968 --> 00:28:13,513
Max Julian, Carol Speed and Richard Pryor.

368
00:28:14,847 --> 00:28:17,600
I'm not scared of you. I just don't like you.

369
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:21,270
That's payoff money.
Alabama is moving on to greener pastures.

370
00:28:21,354 --> 00:28:23,481
We're not negotiating, I don't like to barter.

371
00:28:23,564 --> 00:28:25,775
What's in there is for my peace of mind.

372
00:28:25,858 --> 00:28:29,362
My peace of mind is worth that much.
Not one penny more.

373
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,498
It's empty.

374
00:28:50,424 --> 00:28:54,720
Marty, you know what we got here?
A motherfucking Charlie Bronson.

375
00:28:57,223 --> 00:28:58,474
"Mr. Majestyk?"

376
00:28:59,725 --> 00:29:01,769
Look here, Charlie.

377
00:29:03,229 --> 00:29:04,981
None of this bullshit is necessary.

378
00:29:05,064 --> 00:29:07,191
I don't got no hold over Alabama.

379
00:29:08,401 --> 00:29:11,237
I was just trying to lend a girl
a helping hand.

380
00:30:09,921 --> 00:30:11,506
That's what you get.

381
00:30:12,423 --> 00:30:14,592
You fuck with me, white-boy!

382
00:30:15,301 --> 00:30:18,179
Look at this!
You fond of my motherfucking freaks?

383
00:30:18,387 --> 00:30:20,097
Shit! You motherfucker!

384
00:30:20,223 --> 00:30:21,974
Your ass got to be crazy!

385
00:30:31,067 --> 00:30:33,611
You must have thought
it was white-boy day.

386
00:30:35,363 --> 00:30:37,198
It ain't white-boy day, is it?

387
00:30:37,281 --> 00:30:39,283
No man, it ain't white-boy day.

388
00:30:39,992 --> 00:30:42,161
Shit man, you done fucked up again.

389
00:30:58,719 --> 00:31:01,264
Well, well, well.

390
00:31:01,681 --> 00:31:03,683
Look what we got here.

391
00:31:05,393 --> 00:31:06,727
Clarence Worley?

392
00:31:09,188 --> 00:31:11,399
It sounds almost like a nigger name.

393
00:31:12,692 --> 00:31:14,443
And I know where you live.

394
00:31:14,694 --> 00:31:18,447
4900, 160th Street...

395
00:31:18,656 --> 00:31:20,032
Apartment 48.

396
00:31:21,242 --> 00:31:25,455
And I would make a million-dollar bet,
that Alabama is at the same address.

397
00:31:25,538 --> 00:31:29,083
Marty, take the car, go get her.
Bring her dumb ass back here.

398
00:31:30,543 --> 00:31:33,254
I think I'll keep lover boy here entertained.

399
00:31:37,758 --> 00:31:38,843
Hey, Marty!

400
00:31:39,177 --> 00:31:40,428
What the fuck are you doing?

401
00:31:40,511 --> 00:31:43,723
- I can't find my jacket!
- Go look in the fucking hamper.

402
00:31:53,357 --> 00:31:54,025
You!

403
00:31:54,108 --> 00:31:57,612
Get a bag and put Alabama's things in it.
You want to get fucking shot?

404
00:31:57,695 --> 00:32:00,239
Get a bag and put Alabama's things in it!

405
00:32:00,364 --> 00:32:03,493
I just did you the biggest fucking favor
of your life!

406
00:32:05,036 --> 00:32:06,287
Open your eyes.

407
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,290
I said open your fucking eyes!

408
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:13,002
You thought it was pretty fucking funny.
Didn't you?

409
00:32:13,085 --> 00:32:15,963
Fuck you! You piece of shit!

410
00:32:20,635 --> 00:32:22,094
Don't fucking move!

411
00:32:22,553 --> 00:32:25,681
I was selfish. I know I was selfish.
l was, but...

412
00:32:28,184 --> 00:32:30,353
I was carrying your child, babe.

413
00:32:42,031 --> 00:32:43,282
I killed him.

414
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:46,494
Want a hamburger or something?
I'm starving to death.

415
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:47,870
Is this a joke?

416
00:32:48,663 --> 00:32:49,664
No joke.

417
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:55,253
That was the best fucking hamburger
I ever had in my life.

418
00:32:55,336 --> 00:32:57,964
I've never had a hamburger taste this good.

419
00:32:58,589 --> 00:33:01,217
Come on, eat something, you'll feel better.

420
00:33:06,472 --> 00:33:09,475
What the fuck you crying for?

421
00:33:10,351 --> 00:33:14,021
He's not worth one of your tears.
Would you rather it have been me?

422
00:33:14,105 --> 00:33:17,567
Is that it? Is that what you want?
I mean, do you love him?

423
00:33:18,025 --> 00:33:19,485
Do you love him?

424
00:33:20,027 --> 00:33:22,071
I said, do you fucking love him?

425
00:33:22,947 --> 00:33:25,074
- I think what you did was...
- What?

426
00:33:25,324 --> 00:33:27,326
- I think what you did...
- What?

427
00:33:27,785 --> 00:33:30,496
was so romantic.

428
00:33:37,211 --> 00:33:39,046
Oh, baby, you're bleeding.

429
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,969
I got your things right here.

430
00:33:49,223 --> 00:33:50,475
Clean clothes.

431
00:33:51,476 --> 00:33:52,643
I love you.

432
00:33:52,727 --> 00:33:54,729
I love you. There is a God.

433
00:34:20,087 --> 00:34:22,381
These aren't my clothes.

434
00:34:44,111 --> 00:34:47,698
Rommel, where are you?
Come on get in here. Get in here now.

435
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,731
Good morning, Daddy.

436
00:35:21,524 --> 00:35:22,692
Hey, Rommel.

437
00:35:22,942 --> 00:35:24,527
Long time no see, huh?

438
00:35:31,659 --> 00:35:34,328
Now you're going to have
to excuse the place.

439
00:35:35,204 --> 00:35:38,291
I haven't exactly been doing
a lot of entertaining...

440
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:40,543
of company as of late.

441
00:35:41,836 --> 00:35:44,297
I'm sorry if I seem a little tense.

442
00:35:45,047 --> 00:35:49,343
But you're the last person in the world,
that I expected to see this morning.

443
00:35:49,427 --> 00:35:53,014
Well, that's okay, Daddy,
I tend to have that effect on people.

444
00:35:53,181 --> 00:35:56,309
You got anything to drink around here?
I'm dying of thirst.

445
00:35:56,392 --> 00:36:00,605
Now there should be,
there should be a Seven-Up in there.

446
00:36:00,813 --> 00:36:02,231
Anything stronger?

447
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:06,110
Probably not. Beer.
You can drink beer, can't you?

448
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,614
I can, but I don't.

449
00:36:11,949 --> 00:36:13,868
That's about all I ever eat.

450
00:36:16,037 --> 00:36:17,121
Excuse me.

451
00:36:18,289 --> 00:36:19,791
Hello, hello, hello.

452
00:36:20,374 --> 00:36:21,626
I'm his father.

453
00:36:23,044 --> 00:36:27,381
Well that's all right. I'm his wife,
Alabama Worley. Pleased to meet you.

454
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:30,384
We got married.

455
00:36:47,443 --> 00:36:50,655
Lover, why don't you be a sport
and go get us some beer?

456
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,240
You want some beer?

457
00:36:52,824 --> 00:36:54,742
If you want some, it'll be here. Okay?

458
00:36:54,826 --> 00:36:56,536
Where is a liquor store around here?

459
00:36:56,619 --> 00:36:59,080
There is a party store down 54th Street.

460
00:37:00,957 --> 00:37:03,709
Get a six-pack of something imported.

461
00:37:03,793 --> 00:37:07,171
Hard to tell you what to get.
Different places have different things.

462
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:09,549
Here, that should cover it, okee-dokee?

463
00:37:09,632 --> 00:37:11,300
Okee-dokee, Doggy Daddy.

464
00:37:22,436 --> 00:37:26,357
Ain't she the sweetest goddamn thing
you ever saw in your whole life?

465
00:37:26,649 --> 00:37:29,485
I mean, is she a four-alarm fire, or what?

466
00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:32,780
She seems very nice.

467
00:37:33,865 --> 00:37:34,866
Nice?

468
00:37:35,324 --> 00:37:38,911
Daddy, "nice" is not the word.
I mean this girl, she's a peach.

469
00:37:39,162 --> 00:37:41,539
You know, she even tastes like a peach.

470
00:37:42,206 --> 00:37:44,917
You can tell I'm in love with her, can't you?

471
00:37:46,502 --> 00:37:48,212
No, wait. I gotta talk.

472
00:37:50,465 --> 00:37:52,592
Sit down! Shut up!

473
00:37:53,885 --> 00:37:55,887
You give me a fucking headache.

474
00:37:56,929 --> 00:37:59,724
You are so much like your mother,
I can't believe it.

475
00:37:59,807 --> 00:38:02,268
You are your fucking mother,
through and through.

476
00:38:02,393 --> 00:38:05,104
I haven't heard from you in three years.

477
00:38:06,397 --> 00:38:09,400
You show up all of a sudden,
at 8:00 in the morning...

478
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:12,236
you walk in here
like a goddamned bulldozer.

479
00:38:13,154 --> 00:38:16,365
Now don't get me wrong.
I love you, I'm glad to see you.

480
00:38:18,242 --> 00:38:20,620
But slow it down, man.

481
00:38:22,246 --> 00:38:23,331
All right?

482
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:26,042
Now.

483
00:38:29,545 --> 00:38:31,255
When did you get married?

484
00:38:34,675 --> 00:38:35,927
Well, Daddy....

485
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:40,890
I'm in big fucking trouble.

486
00:38:41,516 --> 00:38:43,726
I really need your help.

487
00:38:44,268 --> 00:38:45,853
No, no, stop talking.

488
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,484
- What do you want from me?
- What?

489
00:38:51,567 --> 00:38:54,821
What do you want from me?
Stop acting like an infant!

490
00:38:55,279 --> 00:38:57,532
You're here because you want me
to help you.

491
00:38:57,615 --> 00:39:00,076
What do you need from me?
You need money?

492
00:39:00,451 --> 00:39:02,995
No. You still have friends on the force?

493
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:05,164
Yes, I still have friends on the force.

494
00:39:05,248 --> 00:39:07,291
Could you find out if they know about us?

495
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:10,378
I don't think they know shit.
But I want to know for sure.

496
00:39:10,461 --> 00:39:12,130
You can do that. Right?

497
00:39:12,213 --> 00:39:14,298
What makes you think I could do that?

498
00:39:14,382 --> 00:39:15,716
Because you were a cop.

499
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,553
But what makes you think
that I would do that?

500
00:39:19,637 --> 00:39:21,222
Because I'm your son.

501
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,808
Oh, you're my son.

502
00:39:23,975 --> 00:39:27,311
Oh, you got it all worked out, don't you?

503
00:39:28,688 --> 00:39:32,358
Look. I mean, goddamn,
I've never asked you for a goddamn thing.

504
00:39:32,483 --> 00:39:34,735
Jesus fucking Christ!
After Mom divorced you...

505
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:37,697
did I ever ask you for anything?
No. I didn't.

506
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,324
When I wouldn't see you
for one or two years...

507
00:39:40,408 --> 00:39:41,909
did I ever get into your shit?

508
00:39:41,993 --> 00:39:44,370
The whole time you were drunk,
did I get mad...

509
00:39:44,495 --> 00:39:45,580
point my finger?

510
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:48,666
No! I never did.
Everybody else did, but I didn't!

511
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:52,670
Now look, I just need help,
and you can fucking help me. All right?

512
00:39:53,212 --> 00:39:58,176
Now, I'm basically a resourceful guy.
If I didn't really need it, I wouldn't ask.

513
00:39:58,468 --> 00:40:01,596
I mean, if you want to say no, then fine.

514
00:40:02,054 --> 00:40:05,725
Forget it, don't worry about it.
No problem, I'm gone, all right?

515
00:40:11,397 --> 00:40:12,899
The Virgin is back!

516
00:40:14,901 --> 00:40:17,278
Thank God. I could eat a horse.

517
00:40:17,361 --> 00:40:19,113
I didn't get you any chicken.

518
00:40:19,197 --> 00:40:20,448
Well, how come?

519
00:40:20,948 --> 00:40:24,076
Honey, it's too early in the morning.
It's only 9:00.

520
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,411
Son of a bitch!

521
00:40:32,376 --> 00:40:34,545
Dick Richie! Dick Richie!

522
00:40:35,296 --> 00:40:36,714
That's me, I'm me.

523
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,841
Come inside.

524
00:40:38,925 --> 00:40:39,926
Okay.

525
00:40:46,474 --> 00:40:47,975
Sit. Sit, sit.

526
00:40:48,684 --> 00:40:49,560
Now.

527
00:40:49,977 --> 00:40:52,355
The part you'll be reading
is one of the bad guys.

528
00:40:52,438 --> 00:40:53,898
There's Brian and Marty.

529
00:40:53,981 --> 00:40:54,816
Who?

530
00:40:55,483 --> 00:40:56,943
Is there a problem?

531
00:40:57,151 --> 00:40:58,152
No.

532
00:40:58,444 --> 00:41:00,613
Peter Breck has been cast
in the part of Brian.

533
00:41:00,696 --> 00:41:03,157
So, you'll be reading for the role of Marty.

534
00:41:03,282 --> 00:41:07,537
In this scene, you're both in a car,
and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.

535
00:41:07,829 --> 00:41:09,997
What you want to do is get him off.

536
00:41:11,124 --> 00:41:12,667
All right, I'm Marty.

537
00:41:14,127 --> 00:41:15,128
Ready?

538
00:41:18,339 --> 00:41:19,507
I'm driving.

539
00:41:20,341 --> 00:41:21,259
Okay.

540
00:41:22,343 --> 00:41:23,928
"Where the fuck did he come from?"

541
00:41:24,011 --> 00:41:26,347
"I don't know,
he just appeared like magic".

542
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:29,350
"Well, don't just sit there, shoot him!"

543
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:31,310
"Get him!"

544
00:41:31,394 --> 00:41:32,979
Thank you, Mr. Richie.

545
00:41:33,312 --> 00:41:35,982
I'm very impressed.
You're a very fine actor.

546
00:41:37,483 --> 00:41:38,568
Thank you.

547
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:40,403
Thank you.

548
00:41:40,862 --> 00:41:42,321
We'll let you know.

549
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:43,948
Okay.

550
00:41:44,282 --> 00:41:46,534
- Okay, one-handed.
- One hand.

551
00:41:47,785 --> 00:41:49,287
Good, try on the other one there.

552
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:50,913
Here comes the train.

553
00:42:00,965 --> 00:42:05,970
Well, they found nothing.
In fact, they think it's drug related.

554
00:42:07,346 --> 00:42:08,973
Drug related? Why drug related?

555
00:42:09,056 --> 00:42:12,268
Well, apparently Drexl had his
big toe stuck in that shit.

556
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,352
Really?

557
00:42:13,561 --> 00:42:17,023
Drexl had an association
with a fellow named Blue Lou Boyle.

558
00:42:17,648 --> 00:42:20,026
- Name mean anything to you?
- No.

559
00:42:20,234 --> 00:42:22,904
If you don't hang around his circle,
it shouldn't.

560
00:42:22,987 --> 00:42:23,821
Who is he?

561
00:42:23,905 --> 00:42:26,574
Gangster, drug dealer.
You don't want him on your ass.

562
00:42:26,657 --> 00:42:30,912
Now look, Clarence, the more I hear
about this Drexl fucker...

563
00:42:31,412 --> 00:42:35,750
the more I think you did the right thing.
This guy was not just some wild flake.

564
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:39,879
That's what I was trying to tell you before.
The guy was like a mad dog.

565
00:42:41,255 --> 00:42:44,383
So, the cops, they don't think....
They're not after us?

566
00:42:44,467 --> 00:42:46,761
No. Until they hear something better.

567
00:42:46,844 --> 00:42:50,306
They will just assume Drexl
had a falling out with Blue Lou.

568
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:54,560
And once you leave town,
I wouldn't even worry about it.

569
00:42:55,728 --> 00:42:59,190
Thanks, thanks a lot, Daddy.
You really came through for me.

570
00:43:01,526 --> 00:43:03,361
I got some money I could give you.

571
00:43:03,444 --> 00:43:05,071
No, keep it. Keep it.

572
00:43:06,364 --> 00:43:07,615
Well now, son.

573
00:43:09,075 --> 00:43:10,868
I want you to know that...

574
00:43:11,744 --> 00:43:14,872
I hope everything works out
with you and Alabama.

575
00:43:15,915 --> 00:43:16,999
I like her.

576
00:43:18,793 --> 00:43:22,004
And I think you make a real cute couple.

577
00:43:24,924 --> 00:43:27,176
Yeah, well, you stay out of trouble.

578
00:43:29,595 --> 00:43:33,182
You got a wife to think about now.

579
00:43:34,934 --> 00:43:36,435
Quit fucking around.

580
00:43:39,438 --> 00:43:40,439
Son...

581
00:43:43,317 --> 00:43:44,569
I love you.

582
00:43:53,828 --> 00:43:54,912
All right.

583
00:43:56,622 --> 00:44:00,835
This is my friend Dick Richie's
number and address in Hollywood.

584
00:44:01,335 --> 00:44:03,713
That's where we'll be.

585
00:44:03,796 --> 00:44:04,881
All right.

586
00:44:05,173 --> 00:44:08,342
Come on, Alabama. We're taking off.
Kiss Pops goodbye.

587
00:44:11,888 --> 00:44:14,432
'Bye, Daddy. Hope to see you again soon.

588
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:18,895
Hey, hey!

589
00:44:19,103 --> 00:44:21,105
What kind of smackaroo is that?

590
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:27,069
I'll send you a postcard from Hollywood.

591
00:44:27,153 --> 00:44:28,529
Alabama.

592
00:44:28,779 --> 00:44:29,864
Yes, sir?

593
00:44:30,031 --> 00:44:31,407
Take care of him for me.

594
00:44:31,491 --> 00:44:34,035
Don't worry, Daddy.
I'll keep him on a short leash.

595
00:44:34,118 --> 00:44:38,206
As the sun sets slowly in the west.
We bid you a fine farewell.

596
00:44:45,922 --> 00:44:49,383
Son of a bitch was right.
She tastes like a peach.

597
00:44:50,176 --> 00:44:51,344
Come on, Rommel.

598
00:44:51,427 --> 00:44:53,387
Come on boy.

599
00:45:09,403 --> 00:45:10,321
Hello.

600
00:45:10,404 --> 00:45:12,114
Hello, baby!

601
00:45:12,573 --> 00:45:13,533
Clarence?

602
00:45:13,616 --> 00:45:14,700
You got it!

603
00:45:14,867 --> 00:45:17,120
It's great to hear from you,
what's going on?

604
00:45:17,203 --> 00:45:19,330
Well, you're going to be seeing me shortly.

605
00:45:19,413 --> 00:45:21,332
You're coming to LA! When?

606
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:23,209
Tomorrow.

607
00:45:24,085 --> 00:45:26,546
There's a story behind the letter.

608
00:45:26,671 --> 00:45:29,632
By the way, I won't be alone.
I'm bringing my lovely wife.

609
00:45:29,715 --> 00:45:32,343
Get the fuck out of here.
Clarence, you got married?

610
00:45:32,426 --> 00:45:34,178
I'm a married man, buddy.

611
00:45:34,929 --> 00:45:37,640
You want to say hello to my better half?
Come here.

612
00:45:37,723 --> 00:45:39,392
Hi, Dick. This is Alabama Worley.

613
00:45:39,475 --> 00:45:41,602
How you doing, Alabama Worley?

614
00:45:42,812 --> 00:45:45,857
Clarence told me about you.
He said you're his best friend.

615
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:49,277
- So, that makes you my best friend too.
- Tell him we got to go.

616
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,195
Clarence says we got to go.

617
00:45:51,571 --> 00:45:53,322
Wait, can I speak to Clarence?

618
00:45:53,406 --> 00:45:55,783
- Ask him if he got it.
- Did you get the letter?

619
00:45:55,867 --> 00:45:56,784
What letter?

620
00:45:56,868 --> 00:45:59,078
- What letter?
- Letters.

621
00:45:59,495 --> 00:46:00,955
I didn't get any letter.

622
00:46:01,038 --> 00:46:02,874
Has he gotten his mail yet?

623
00:46:02,957 --> 00:46:05,793
- Have you gotten your mail?
- No, my roommate, Floyd....

624
00:46:05,877 --> 00:46:09,172
- Has he looked through it?
- Have you looked through it?

625
00:46:11,674 --> 00:46:13,509
Tell him to go look through it.

626
00:46:13,593 --> 00:46:15,344
Go and look through it.

627
00:46:16,262 --> 00:46:19,182
Wait, wait, wait.
Can I speak to Clarence, please?

628
00:46:20,057 --> 00:46:21,767
He wants to talk to you.

629
00:46:21,851 --> 00:46:24,854
Tell him we got to go.
Tell him, "Read the letter".

630
00:46:25,104 --> 00:46:25,980
Read the letter.

631
00:46:26,063 --> 00:46:28,941
Tell him I love him
and that as of tomorrow.

632
00:46:29,025 --> 00:46:30,401
Honey, hold this.

633
00:46:31,027 --> 00:46:32,528
As of tomorrow...

634
00:46:32,612 --> 00:46:35,531
all your money problems gonna be over.

635
00:46:37,366 --> 00:46:39,243
Hello? What money problems?

636
00:46:41,287 --> 00:46:42,538
Bye-bye.

637
00:46:44,707 --> 00:46:46,751
Hello?

638
00:47:00,306 --> 00:47:01,307
Floyd!

639
00:47:01,557 --> 00:47:04,477
Floyd, you used up the last piece
of toilet paper.

640
00:47:25,414 --> 00:47:26,666
Hey! Rommel!

641
00:47:27,583 --> 00:47:29,669
Hey, come here! Rommel!

642
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:51,941
Frankie.

643
00:47:52,108 --> 00:47:54,735
Tell Luca to go outside
and do you know what.

644
00:48:03,828 --> 00:48:05,955
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?

645
00:48:07,665 --> 00:48:09,542
I give up. Who are you?

646
00:48:10,793 --> 00:48:14,464
The anti-Christ.
You got me in a vendetta kind of mood.

647
00:48:15,381 --> 00:48:16,841
You can tell the angels...

648
00:48:16,924 --> 00:48:19,260
you never saw evil
so singularly personified...

649
00:48:19,343 --> 00:48:21,888
as in the face of the man who killed you.

650
00:48:21,971 --> 00:48:25,892
My name is Vincent Coccotti.
I work as counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle.

651
00:48:25,975 --> 00:48:27,894
The man your son stole from.

652
00:48:29,145 --> 00:48:32,899
I hear you were once a cop, so I can
assume you have heard of us before.

653
00:48:32,982 --> 00:48:34,150
Am I correct?

654
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:36,819
I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.

655
00:48:37,528 --> 00:48:41,782
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up
the how-full-of-shit-am-I question...

656
00:48:41,866 --> 00:48:44,118
you been asking yourself.

657
00:48:46,037 --> 00:48:47,789
We're going to have a little Q and A.

658
00:48:47,872 --> 00:48:50,708
And at the risk of sounding redundant,
please...

659
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:52,794
make your answers genuine.

660
00:48:53,961 --> 00:48:55,463
Want a Chesterfield?

661
00:48:56,172 --> 00:48:57,006
No.

662
00:48:58,382 --> 00:49:01,010
I have a son of my own,
about your boy's age.

663
00:49:02,053 --> 00:49:05,431
I can imagine how painful
this must be for you.

664
00:49:05,515 --> 00:49:06,766
But Clarence...

665
00:49:07,475 --> 00:49:10,603
and his bitch of a girlfriend,
brought this on themselves.

666
00:49:10,686 --> 00:49:13,564
I implore you not to go down that road
with them.

667
00:49:14,357 --> 00:49:18,027
You could always take comfort
in the fact you never had a choice.

668
00:49:19,612 --> 00:49:21,239
I'd like to help you if I could...

669
00:49:21,322 --> 00:49:23,407
but I haven't seen Clarence.

670
00:49:28,121 --> 00:49:29,372
You see that?

671
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:35,211
That smarts doesn't it?
To get slammed in the nose.

672
00:49:36,629 --> 00:49:39,841
Fucks you up. You get the pain
shooting through your brain...

673
00:49:39,924 --> 00:49:41,968
your eyes fill up with water.

674
00:49:42,426 --> 00:49:44,178
It's not any kind of fun.

675
00:49:44,554 --> 00:49:48,307
But, what I have to offer you,
that's as good as it's going to get.

676
00:49:49,392 --> 00:49:51,769
And it won't ever get that good again.

677
00:49:52,478 --> 00:49:55,314
We talked to your neighbors.
They saw a Cadillac.

678
00:49:57,441 --> 00:49:58,818
Purple Cadillac.

679
00:49:59,402 --> 00:50:03,322
Clarence's purple Cadillac,
parked in front of your trailer yesterday.

680
00:50:04,365 --> 00:50:05,449
Mr. Worley.

681
00:50:06,284 --> 00:50:07,952
Have you seen your son?

682
00:50:08,578 --> 00:50:09,829
I've seen him.

683
00:50:10,455 --> 00:50:12,915
I can't be sure of how much he told you.

684
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,751
In the chance you're in the dark
about some of this...

685
00:50:15,835 --> 00:50:19,672
let me shed some light.
That whore your boy hangs around with....

686
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:22,300
Her pimp is an associate of mine.

687
00:50:23,092 --> 00:50:26,554
Along with other affairs
he works for me in a courier capacity.

688
00:50:26,637 --> 00:50:28,389
Well, apparently...

689
00:50:29,265 --> 00:50:32,602
that dirty whore found out
we were going to do some business...

690
00:50:32,685 --> 00:50:36,939
because your son, the cowboy and
his flame, came into the room blazing...

691
00:50:37,023 --> 00:50:40,776
and didn't stop, until they were
pretty sure everybody was dead.

692
00:50:42,445 --> 00:50:44,238
What are you talking about?

693
00:50:44,697 --> 00:50:47,992
I'm talking about a massacre.
They snatched my narcotics.

694
00:50:49,285 --> 00:50:51,954
Hightailed it out of there.
Would have got away with it.

695
00:50:52,038 --> 00:50:54,791
But your son, fuckhead that he is...

696
00:50:55,374 --> 00:50:58,544
left his driver's license
in the dead guy's hand.

697
00:51:02,131 --> 00:51:03,049
You know.

698
00:51:03,132 --> 00:51:04,634
I don't believe you.

699
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,677
That's of minor importance.

700
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:10,014
What's of major fucking importance
is that I believe you.

701
00:51:11,682 --> 00:51:13,184
Where did they go?

702
00:51:13,893 --> 00:51:15,353
On their honeymoon.

703
00:51:21,859 --> 00:51:24,779
I'm getting angry asking the same question
a second time.

704
00:51:24,862 --> 00:51:25,738
Where did they go?

705
00:51:25,822 --> 00:51:29,325
They didn't tell me.
Now wait a minute and listen to me.

706
00:51:29,408 --> 00:51:31,786
I haven't seen Clarence in three years.

707
00:51:32,912 --> 00:51:34,580
He shows up yesterday...

708
00:51:34,705 --> 00:51:37,583
with a young girl,
saying that he got married.

709
00:51:39,585 --> 00:51:42,713
He asked for some quick cash...

710
00:51:44,549 --> 00:51:48,594
to go on a honeymoon.
He asked me if he could borrow $500.

711
00:51:50,388 --> 00:51:52,098
I felt like helping him.

712
00:51:52,265 --> 00:51:55,935
So, I wrote him out a check.
We went to breakfast in the morning.

713
00:51:57,895 --> 00:52:00,231
And that's the last I saw of him...

714
00:52:01,274 --> 00:52:02,692
so help me God.

715
00:52:04,193 --> 00:52:07,238
They never thought to tell me
where they were going.

716
00:52:08,531 --> 00:52:10,324
And I never thought to ask.

717
00:52:33,764 --> 00:52:35,016
Vincenzo, sir.

718
00:52:35,808 --> 00:52:37,393
There's nothing there.

719
00:52:39,562 --> 00:52:40,938
That's not good.

720
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:43,774
You know.

721
00:52:45,067 --> 00:52:47,987
Sicilians are great liars.

722
00:52:49,572 --> 00:52:51,157
The best in the world.

723
00:52:53,493 --> 00:52:54,827
I'm Sicilian...

724
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:58,748
my father was the world heavyweight
champion of Sicilian liars.

725
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:03,252
From growing up with him,
I learned the pantomime.

726
00:53:04,003 --> 00:53:06,923
There are 17 different things
a guy can do when he lies...

727
00:53:07,006 --> 00:53:10,092
to give himself away.
A guy has got 17 pantomimes.

728
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:13,054
Woman has got 20. Guy has got 17. But...

729
00:53:13,346 --> 00:53:16,265
if you know them,
like you know your own face...

730
00:53:16,349 --> 00:53:19,185
they would beat lie detectors all to hell.

731
00:53:19,268 --> 00:53:22,188
Now what we got here
is a game of "Show and Tell".

732
00:53:22,271 --> 00:53:26,192
You don't want to show me nothing.
But you're telling me everything.

733
00:53:26,275 --> 00:53:29,946
I know you know where they are.
So, tell me...

734
00:53:30,822 --> 00:53:33,866
before I do some damage
you won't walk away from.

735
00:53:37,036 --> 00:53:39,789
Could I have one
of those Chesterfields now?

736
00:53:42,458 --> 00:53:43,334
Sure.

737
00:53:49,215 --> 00:53:50,716
You got a...

738
00:53:51,759 --> 00:53:54,595
match? No wait. Don't bother, I got one.

739
00:54:05,273 --> 00:54:06,858
You're Sicilian, huh?

740
00:54:08,109 --> 00:54:09,443
Yeah, Sicilian.

741
00:54:13,447 --> 00:54:14,615
You know....

742
00:54:16,742 --> 00:54:17,910
I read a lot.

743
00:54:18,786 --> 00:54:20,872
Especially things about history.

744
00:54:23,082 --> 00:54:25,042
I find that shit fascinating.

745
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:29,714
Here's a fact, whether you know it or not.

746
00:54:33,968 --> 00:54:37,305
Sicilians were spawned by niggers.

747
00:54:45,313 --> 00:54:46,481
Come again?

748
00:54:48,524 --> 00:54:51,402
It's a fact. Yeah. You see...

749
00:54:52,236 --> 00:54:56,073
Sicilians have black blood
pumping through their hearts.

750
00:54:58,034 --> 00:55:01,204
And if you don't believe me,
you can look it up.

751
00:55:01,704 --> 00:55:04,415
Hundreds and hundreds of years ago,
you see...

752
00:55:04,957 --> 00:55:08,795
the Moors conquered Sicily.
And the Moors are niggers.

753
00:55:10,922 --> 00:55:12,673
You see, way back then...

754
00:55:13,466 --> 00:55:16,302
Sicilians were like wops
from northern Italy.

755
00:55:17,386 --> 00:55:19,680
They all had blond hair and blue eyes.

756
00:55:19,764 --> 00:55:20,932
But, well....

757
00:55:23,017 --> 00:55:25,061
Then the Moors moved in there...

758
00:55:27,021 --> 00:55:29,148
they changed the whole country.

759
00:55:29,398 --> 00:55:33,486
They did so much fucking
with Sicilian women.

760
00:55:34,487 --> 00:55:37,198
That they changed
the whole bloodline forever.

761
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:40,827
That is why blond hair, blue eyes...

762
00:55:41,077 --> 00:55:44,247
became black hair and dark skin.

763
00:55:45,331 --> 00:55:48,543
You know it's absolutely amazing to me...

764
00:55:50,753 --> 00:55:52,505
to think to this day...

765
00:55:52,588 --> 00:55:54,590
hundreds of years later...

766
00:55:56,592 --> 00:55:58,261
that Sicilians...

767
00:55:59,345 --> 00:56:01,389
still carry that nigger gene.

768
00:56:03,349 --> 00:56:04,892
Now this....

769
00:56:04,976 --> 00:56:07,186
No, I am quoting history.

770
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:11,941
It's written, it's a fact. It's written.

771
00:56:12,733 --> 00:56:14,068
I love this guy!

772
00:56:19,824 --> 00:56:21,617
Your ancestors are niggers.

773
00:56:24,203 --> 00:56:25,079
Hey!

774
00:56:28,416 --> 00:56:30,376
And your great, great, great...

775
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:33,004
great grandmother fucked a nigger.

776
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:38,426
And she had a half-nigger kid. Now...

777
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,638
if that is a fact, tell me?

778
00:56:43,973 --> 00:56:45,141
Am I lying?

779
00:56:49,395 --> 00:56:50,646
'Cause you...

780
00:56:53,399 --> 00:56:55,151
you are part eggplant.

781
00:57:03,701 --> 00:57:05,119
Egg! Egg! Egg!

782
00:57:06,245 --> 00:57:07,789
You are a cantaloupe.

783
00:57:18,674 --> 00:57:20,176
That was beautiful.

784
00:57:42,406 --> 00:57:44,200
I haven't killed anybody...

785
00:57:45,117 --> 00:57:46,536
since 1984.

786
00:57:50,248 --> 00:57:52,625
Go to this comedian's son's apartment.

787
00:57:53,334 --> 00:57:56,921
Come back with something that tells me
where that asshole went.

788
00:57:57,463 --> 00:57:59,632
So I can wipe this egg off my face.

789
00:58:13,271 --> 00:58:15,439
Fix this fucked-up family for good.

790
00:58:21,404 --> 00:58:22,488
Hey, Boss.

791
00:58:23,865 --> 00:58:25,449
Get ready to be happy.

792
00:58:27,351 --> 00:58:31,354
'Morning, everybody. It's 6:22 here in LA.
I'm David Perry at KBLU.

793
00:58:48,617 --> 00:58:51,077
Hello?

794
00:58:56,582 --> 00:58:57,582
Floyd.

795
00:59:01,169 --> 00:59:03,712
Can't you answer the door at least for me?

796
00:59:03,837 --> 00:59:05,838
Oh, man, I didn't even hear it.

797
00:59:06,673 --> 00:59:07,757
Hello?

798
00:59:08,049 --> 00:59:10,258
Can't you help me every now and then?

799
00:59:10,343 --> 00:59:12,177
Yes.

800
00:59:13,803 --> 00:59:15,804
- You call for a date?
- Huh?

801
00:59:18,557 --> 00:59:19,974
I knew it was you!

802
00:59:21,643 --> 00:59:23,935
Dick, this is Alabama.
Alabama, this is Dick.

803
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,187
Nice to meet you!

804
00:59:25,271 --> 00:59:27,564
- How long have you lived here?
- I'm Alabama.

805
00:59:27,648 --> 00:59:29,982
- You look good!
- This is a great place.

806
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:32,108
I'm starving. Let's get something to eat.

807
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:34,027
- Who's this?
- This is Floyd.

808
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:36,028
Let's go! Come on!

809
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:40,365
Hey.

810
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:56,294
Hey. I didn't tell you guys yet?

811
00:59:56,379 --> 01:00:00,298
I had this really, really good audition
for T.J. Hooker the other day.

812
01:00:01,006 --> 01:00:04,175
- You're going to be on T.J. Hooker?
- Yeah, the new T.J. Hooker.

813
01:00:04,259 --> 01:00:05,259
Knock on wood.

814
01:00:05,386 --> 01:00:08,930
- You get to meet Captain Kirk?
- You don't meet him in the audition...

815
01:00:09,013 --> 01:00:11,473
but if I get the part, hope, hope....

816
01:00:12,265 --> 01:00:14,809
- That would be amazing.
- It'd be cool....

817
01:00:14,892 --> 01:00:17,435
Meeting Captain Kirk, that would be cool.

818
01:00:27,528 --> 01:00:28,695
Here we are.

819
01:00:31,572 --> 01:00:33,073
The honeymoon suite.

820
01:00:35,993 --> 01:00:37,535
You're really in love, aren't you?

821
01:00:37,618 --> 01:00:41,705
For the very first time in my life.
Know what that's like?

822
01:00:41,788 --> 01:00:42,579
No.

823
01:00:44,582 --> 01:00:45,249
No.

824
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:46,709
Shut the fuck up.

825
01:00:46,959 --> 01:00:49,335
What are you doing in LA anyway, huh?

826
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:58,843
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
This shit can't be real.

827
01:01:00,261 --> 01:01:02,262
- It'll get you high.
- What?

828
01:01:02,513 --> 01:01:03,847
I said, it'll get you high.

829
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:05,347
Hey, we got cable.

830
01:01:06,433 --> 01:01:07,683
Want some wine, sweetheart?

831
01:01:07,767 --> 01:01:10,811
Yeah, just a little bit,
I'm not much of a wine gal.

832
01:01:11,979 --> 01:01:13,771
That stuff is fucking real.

833
01:01:14,355 --> 01:01:15,856
This is fucking real, Clarence.

834
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:17,441
I certainly hope so.

835
01:01:18,108 --> 01:01:20,484
You've got a hell of a lot
of cocaine here, man.

836
01:01:20,611 --> 01:01:21,611
I know.

837
01:01:21,861 --> 01:01:23,945
Do you realize how much coke you have?

838
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:25,196
No, tell me.

839
01:01:26,489 --> 01:01:28,782
I don't know, but it's a fucking lot!

840
01:01:29,784 --> 01:01:31,952
This is DrexI's coke.

841
01:01:32,369 --> 01:01:34,829
No, Drexl is dead, you see.
It's Clarence's coke.

842
01:01:34,954 --> 01:01:38,874
And he can do whatever he wants with it.
What Clarence wants to do is to sell it.

843
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,669
Then, we'll jump on a plane and spend
the rest of our lives spending it.

844
01:01:42,794 --> 01:01:45,546
You got my letter?
You lined up a buyer for me?

845
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:47,130
I'm not Joe Cocaine, okay?

846
01:01:47,214 --> 01:01:48,298
You're an actor.

847
01:01:48,423 --> 01:01:51,050
I hear these Hollywood guys
get it delivered to the set.

848
01:01:51,134 --> 01:01:53,385
Well, they do. All right? They do.

849
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:55,720
Maybe one day,
when I'm a successful actor...

850
01:01:55,804 --> 01:01:57,388
I'll be like one of them.

851
01:01:57,472 --> 01:02:00,265
But, until that day,
I don't have anything. All right?

852
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:03,143
I don't have a pot to piss in,
or a window to throw it out.

853
01:02:03,226 --> 01:02:04,769
All I got is fucking Floyd.

854
01:02:04,853 --> 01:02:08,147
If you want me to help you sell
a bit at a time that's all I can do.

855
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:10,398
No. None of that bit-at-a-time shit.

856
01:02:10,482 --> 01:02:13,400
It's got to be the whole enchilada
in one shot.

857
01:02:13,485 --> 01:02:16,278
Clarence, do you have any idea
how difficult that'll be?

858
01:02:16,362 --> 01:02:18,071
What the fuck you are talking about?

859
01:02:18,155 --> 01:02:21,783
I'm offering $500,000 worth of white
for $200,000. That'll be difficult?

860
01:02:21,866 --> 01:02:25,452
Very difficult.
That's very difficult, understand? Listen.

861
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:29,288
It's difficult because you're selling
to a particular group, understand?

862
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:32,749
Fat cats, big shots.
Guys who can afford $200,000.

863
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:35,584
Guys who can use a whole suitcase
full of cocaine.

864
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,753
Basically, Clarence, guys I don't know.

865
01:02:37,836 --> 01:02:41,673
And guys you don't know. And more
importantly, they don't know you.

866
01:02:45,802 --> 01:02:47,052
Come on, Dick.

867
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:53,890
Okay, Clarence.

868
01:02:54,267 --> 01:02:55,725
Listen.

869
01:02:57,186 --> 01:02:59,020
There's one guy that I know...

870
01:02:59,105 --> 01:03:01,356
that can help you out, Clarence, but...

871
01:03:01,439 --> 01:03:03,899
I'm not guaranteeing you anything.

872
01:03:04,525 --> 01:03:05,900
Is he big-league?

873
01:03:07,361 --> 01:03:09,696
He's not big-league. Okay?

874
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:14,616
But he works as an assistant to a very
big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.

875
01:03:15,367 --> 01:03:17,285
Lee Donowitz could afford...

876
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:20,036
and can use, $200,000-worth of coke.

877
01:03:20,913 --> 01:03:22,998
Being that that's what you have.

878
01:03:23,081 --> 01:03:25,332
All right, so what did you tell him?

879
01:03:25,917 --> 01:03:27,960
What the fuck do you expect me
to tell him?

880
01:03:28,043 --> 01:03:30,503
I didn't know what was bullshit
and what wasn't.

881
01:03:30,587 --> 01:03:34,172
And besides, Floyd smoked
the second page of the letter. Okay?

882
01:03:34,924 --> 01:03:37,134
What's this acting-class guy's name?

883
01:03:37,551 --> 01:03:38,551
Elliot.

884
01:03:39,677 --> 01:03:40,844
Elliot what?

885
01:03:41,137 --> 01:03:42,387
Elliot Blitzer.

886
01:03:43,681 --> 01:03:46,141
We'll get him on the phone
and arrange a meeting...

887
01:03:46,266 --> 01:03:50,269
so we can get through all this
getting-to-know-you stuff, all right?

888
01:03:50,686 --> 01:03:51,644
Where?

889
01:03:52,396 --> 01:03:53,938
Where should we meet?

890
01:03:57,191 --> 01:03:58,066
Roller coaster.

891
01:03:58,150 --> 01:03:59,483
Roller coasters.

892
01:04:04,071 --> 01:04:08,116
So, you have $500,000-worth of cola
that you are unloading for $200,000.

893
01:04:10,493 --> 01:04:12,286
You want an animal cracker?

894
01:04:13,495 --> 01:04:14,495
Thanks.

895
01:04:15,538 --> 01:04:17,789
Wait, save the gorillas.

896
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:22,460
Thanks.

897
01:04:22,753 --> 01:04:24,253
So, you got...

898
01:04:24,962 --> 01:04:26,838
$500,000-worth of cola...

899
01:04:27,006 --> 01:04:29,382
that you're unloading for $200,000.

900
01:04:29,466 --> 01:04:33,552
"Unloading". That's a hell of a way
to describe a bargain of a lifetime.

901
01:04:34,053 --> 01:04:36,679
- Where di
