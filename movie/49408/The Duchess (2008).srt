1
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,419
Lord Thomas.

2
00:01:26,091 --> 00:01:27,456
Lord Henry.

3
00:01:28,727 --> 00:01:30,422
Lord Ambrose.

4
00:01:32,864 --> 00:01:34,229
Lord Robert.

5
00:01:36,735 --> 00:01:38,134
Lord Walter.

6
00:01:41,573 --> 00:01:43,006
You'd better not let me down,
Charles Grey.

7
00:01:43,108 --> 00:01:48,239
-I've got 20 guineas riding on you.
-Only 20? I'd double that if I were you.

8
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,642
Come on, ladies.

9
00:01:58,857 --> 00:02:02,588
Gentlemen, twice around the course,
on my count.

10
00:02:05,363 --> 00:02:07,058
Three, two,

11
00:02:09,334 --> 00:02:10,596
one!

12
00:02:10,702 --> 00:02:12,226
-Come on, Mr. Grey!
-Come on, Thomas!

13
00:02:12,337 --> 00:02:15,306
-Come on, Mr. Grey!
-Run, Lord Walter!

14
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,671
Come on, Mr. Grey!

15
00:02:17,776 --> 00:02:20,438
Come on, Mr. Grey.
You're tired already.

16
00:02:20,545 --> 00:02:23,105
-Come on, Mr. Grey!
-Faster!

17
00:02:37,262 --> 00:02:40,720
I trust Your Grace still finds Georgiana
an attractive girl?

18
00:02:40,832 --> 00:02:42,823
Of course, Lady Spencer.

19
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:46,768
She's an accomplished lady of quality
and devoted to her duties.

20
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:49,499
She's fluent in French, ltalian, Latin

21
00:02:49,607 --> 00:02:52,405
and fully versed in horsemanship
and dancing and...

22
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,378
Yes, I'm aware of all that.
She's a credit to you.

23
00:02:58,249 --> 00:03:00,046
I can't think of anything
that would stand in the way

24
00:03:00,151 --> 00:03:02,312
of a singularly happy marriage.

25
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,719
These are not the issues
that burden the Duke, Lady Spencer.

26
00:03:05,824 --> 00:03:09,021
It is His Grace's duty to produce an heir.

27
00:03:09,127 --> 00:03:10,492
On the other hand,
your daughter may expect

28
00:03:10,595 --> 00:03:13,063
a handsome reward when that occurs.

29
00:03:13,164 --> 00:03:16,463
-Thank you, Heaton.
-Your Grace.

30
00:03:17,635 --> 00:03:19,500
Your Grace may rest assured.

31
00:03:19,604 --> 00:03:23,062
The women in our family
have never forfeited on that account.

32
00:03:24,376 --> 00:03:26,970
Well, with that assurance...

33
00:03:36,254 --> 00:03:37,778
So be it, then.

34
00:03:40,024 --> 00:03:41,821
Come on, Mr. Grey!

35
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:54,066
I do apologize, ladies,
but it appears that my horse has won.

36
00:03:55,673 --> 00:03:57,402
Beat me again, Charles.

37
00:03:59,477 --> 00:04:03,208
-Well done, Mr. Grey.
-Well done.

38
00:04:03,381 --> 00:04:05,906
-So how much do we owe you?
-You owe me 40.

39
00:04:06,017 --> 00:04:10,147
-Twenty, 40.
-My reward?

40
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,728
And what do you suggest?

41
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,821
Your mother wishes to see you,
Lady Georgiana.

42
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,041
Thank you.

43
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:53,163
I must apologize, Mama.
Were we making too much noise?

44
00:04:53,264 --> 00:04:54,822
Not at all, my darling.

45
00:04:54,933 --> 00:04:58,232
We have more important things
to talk of. Come here.

46
00:05:06,377 --> 00:05:09,813
-I have heard a rumor.
-Yes?

47
00:05:11,216 --> 00:05:13,013
That I will soon be addressing
my daughter

48
00:05:13,117 --> 00:05:16,211
as Her Grace,
the Duchess of Devonshire.

49
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:20,417
-ls it true, Mama?
-It is.

50
00:05:22,861 --> 00:05:24,761
The Duke of Devonshire?

51
00:05:29,334 --> 00:05:32,497
I had hoped not to part with you
until 18 at the soonest,

52
00:05:32,604 --> 00:05:33,628
but, with such a fine match,

53
00:05:33,738 --> 00:05:36,332
it would be selfish of me
not to let you go.

54
00:05:36,441 --> 00:05:38,341
-He loves me?
-Yes, of course.

55
00:05:38,443 --> 00:05:40,206
I have only met him twice.

56
00:05:40,311 --> 00:05:41,744
When one truly loves someone,

57
00:05:41,846 --> 00:05:44,246
one doesn't have to know them well
to be sure, Georgiana.

58
00:05:44,382 --> 00:05:46,350
One feels it right away.

59
00:05:48,853 --> 00:05:53,790
-I do believe you will be happy with him.
-I shall, Mama. I know I shall.

60
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:33,179
-Come on!
-She's here!

61
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,384
Your Grace! Your Grace!

62
00:07:43,468 --> 00:07:45,197
-There she is!
-Duchess!

63
00:07:45,303 --> 00:07:47,771
What do they want?

64
00:07:47,872 --> 00:07:50,670
To see me and my new wife, of course.

65
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,904
It can be a nuisance,
but you'll get used to it.

66
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:53,766
Welcome, Your Grace.

67
00:09:10,354 --> 00:09:13,289
Come, boys. Come on.
Hugo, Hugo. Come.

68
00:09:13,391 --> 00:09:16,656
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

69
00:09:18,062 --> 00:09:21,327
It's all right. Yes, yes. This way.

70
00:09:23,201 --> 00:09:25,192
Hugo. Come, boy. Come.

71
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:06,073
Scissors. You may go.

72
00:10:37,675 --> 00:10:41,008
For the life of me,
I could never understand

73
00:10:41,112 --> 00:10:44,309
why women's clothes
must be so damn complicated.

74
00:10:46,484 --> 00:10:49,851
It's just our way
of expressing ourselves, I suppose.

75
00:10:53,424 --> 00:10:56,188
Whatever do you mean?

76
00:10:56,294 --> 00:10:59,855
Well, you have so many ways
of expressing yourselves,

77
00:10:59,964 --> 00:11:04,196
whereas we must make do
with our hats and our dresses.

78
00:11:38,636 --> 00:11:40,604
Would you go to the bed?

79
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:47,965
One has to accept one's responsibility.

80
00:12:48,072 --> 00:12:49,733
Certain obligations come with marriage,

81
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,774
no matter how burdensome
they may seem.

82
00:12:51,876 --> 00:12:54,640
Yes, but when we are together...

83
00:12:56,347 --> 00:13:00,147
But when we are together, intimately,
I mean...

84
00:13:00,251 --> 00:13:02,583
I know. It can be a bother.

85
00:13:02,687 --> 00:13:05,451
However, it is only
until you have given him a son.

86
00:13:05,556 --> 00:13:10,152
Then the occasions will become fewer
and less determined.

87
00:13:10,261 --> 00:13:11,853
I think it might feel different

88
00:13:11,963 --> 00:13:14,830
if he would talk to me
every once in a while.

89
00:13:14,932 --> 00:13:18,891
I mean, it's not that he's unkind,
but he never talks to me.

90
00:13:19,003 --> 00:13:20,265
I thought that he would be like Papa,

91
00:13:20,371 --> 00:13:22,498
that under his cool reserve

92
00:13:22,606 --> 00:13:25,200
there'd be a wealth of depth
and sentiment,

93
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:30,838
but he isn't interested in anything,
apart from his dogs.

94
00:13:30,948 --> 00:13:32,779
Try not to be too hard on His Grace, G.

95
00:13:32,883 --> 00:13:35,943
He's merely intent on fulfilling his duty.

96
00:13:36,053 --> 00:13:40,422
And as for talking to him,
well, whatever is there to talk about?

97
00:13:40,524 --> 00:13:43,152
No, you're quite right.

98
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,490
How foolish of me to think
that I should be able to converse

99
00:13:45,596 --> 00:13:47,587
with my husband.

100
00:13:47,698 --> 00:13:51,691
Georgiana, equip yourself with patience,
fortitude and resignation.

101
00:13:51,802 --> 00:13:54,965
A boy will come soon enough,
and then you'll see.

102
00:14:02,813 --> 00:14:09,377
But we, the Whig Party, simply see this
as just, right and sensible.

103
00:14:09,553 --> 00:14:15,958
Just to bring independence to America.
Right to abolish the slave trade.

104
00:14:16,994 --> 00:14:20,725
And sensible to bring freedom
to the common man,

105
00:14:20,831 --> 00:14:25,791
so the blessings of this blessed plot,
this England,

106
00:14:25,903 --> 00:14:30,840
may be more equally enjoyed
by all of its inhabitants.

107
00:14:37,348 --> 00:14:41,079
I would like to propose a toast
to our host and benefactor

108
00:14:41,185 --> 00:14:46,179
His Grace the Duke
and his beautiful new Duchess.

109
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,087
Please be upstanding.

110
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:58,232
-The Duke and Duchess!
-The Duke and Duchess!

111
00:15:08,012 --> 00:15:09,741
Excellent speech, Mr. Fox.

112
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:13,044
I thank you. It is always easier
to address a congregation of friends,

113
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:17,052
particularly when those friends
are drunk.

114
00:15:17,154 --> 00:15:21,056
And how did the Duchess find
Mr. Fox's speech?

115
00:15:21,158 --> 00:15:24,491
I must confess, I am not yet at ease
with political speeches.

116
00:15:24,595 --> 00:15:27,723
Their very form tends to obstruct
my view of their actual meaning,

117
00:15:27,832 --> 00:15:29,925
if such there be.

118
00:15:30,034 --> 00:15:31,968
In which particular section
of the speech

119
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:34,799
did the message elude Your Grace?

120
00:15:36,474 --> 00:15:39,671
Well, I have great sympathy
with your sentiments in general,

121
00:15:39,777 --> 00:15:44,578
but I fail to fully comprehend
how far we, the Whig Party, that is,

122
00:15:44,682 --> 00:15:47,446
are fully committed
to the concept of freedom.

123
00:15:47,585 --> 00:15:50,520
-We intend to extend the vote.
-To all men?

124
00:15:50,621 --> 00:15:55,081
Heavens, no. But certainly to more men.
Freedom in moderation.

125
00:15:55,192 --> 00:15:57,717
-''Freedom in moderation''?
-Precisely.

126
00:15:59,263 --> 00:16:01,823
I'm sure you are
full of the best intentions, Mr. Fox,

127
00:16:01,932 --> 00:16:04,298
but I dare say
I would not spend my vote,

128
00:16:04,401 --> 00:16:09,100
if I had it, of course,
on so vague a statement.

129
00:16:09,206 --> 00:16:13,506
One is either free or one is not.
The concept of freedom is an absolute.

130
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:15,772
After all,
one cannot be moderately dead

131
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,180
or moderately loved or moderately free.

132
00:16:20,284 --> 00:16:23,185
It must always remain
a matter of either or.

133
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,853
I think it appropriate to say a few words.

134
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,154
When...

135
00:16:55,452 --> 00:16:56,476
Could you check the chamber

136
00:16:56,587 --> 00:16:57,781
-and see if you can find...
-Your Grace.

137
00:16:57,888 --> 00:17:00,379
...different kinds of French lace?

138
00:17:02,793 --> 00:17:06,251
-ls anything the matter?
-No.

139
00:17:08,065 --> 00:17:11,466
-You just left.
-Yes. Well, I had done eating,

140
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:14,197
and those damn speeches
bore me to distraction.

141
00:17:14,305 --> 00:17:16,466
I think we have to ban them
in the future.

142
00:17:16,574 --> 00:17:20,533
But you are the Whigs' main supporter.

143
00:17:20,644 --> 00:17:23,204
Yes. Well,
I've no problem with the politics.

144
00:17:23,314 --> 00:17:25,908
It's just the rhetoric I can't stand.

145
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:33,879
-Shall I come with you?
-No. I mean, why ever should you?

146
00:17:57,281 --> 00:18:01,012
The Duke is perfectly well.
He simply wanted to rest a while.

147
00:18:01,118 --> 00:18:03,018
Do sit down, gentlemen.

148
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,028
Was it the length of the speech
that got the better of the Duke?

149
00:18:14,665 --> 00:18:16,895
Certainly not.

150
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:18,025
He enjoyed it immensely

151
00:18:18,135 --> 00:18:21,866
and expressed a hope
that next time it would be even longer.

152
00:18:23,707 --> 00:18:27,199
-Your Grace.
-Mr. Fox.

153
00:18:54,405 --> 00:18:57,932
-What's going on?
-Nothing to concern you.

154
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,643
-I don't understand.
-Come here.

155
00:19:11,822 --> 00:19:15,519
You look very beautiful tonight.
ls this dress your design?

156
00:19:19,163 --> 00:19:21,028
Yes, it is. Thank you.

157
00:19:28,072 --> 00:19:31,371
Then I think you should allow
your husband to appreciate it

158
00:19:31,475 --> 00:19:33,443
in a little more detail.

159
00:19:35,646 --> 00:19:36,977
Come here.

160
00:20:07,845 --> 00:20:11,804
-Yes, send them in.
-Are we having company?

161
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:16,075
Don't you think
this mutton has a funny taste?

162
00:20:17,788 --> 00:20:21,349
-No. Not really, no.
-I think it does.

163
00:20:30,467 --> 00:20:36,895
G, this is Charlotte,
and she will be staying with us.

164
00:20:40,878 --> 00:20:41,936
Why?

165
00:20:53,624 --> 00:20:57,924
Because her mother is dead,
and she has no other place to go.

166
00:21:02,032 --> 00:21:04,227
Have you fathered that child?

167
00:21:05,469 --> 00:21:10,338
It's... It's only a little girl, G.
It's hardly the end of the world.

168
00:21:12,376 --> 00:21:16,938
-Are you expecting me to look after her?
-We have a house full of vacant rooms.

169
00:21:17,047 --> 00:21:19,709
She needn't bother you.
In fact, she may even be of use to you.

170
00:21:19,817 --> 00:21:22,513
You can practice your mothering skills,

171
00:21:24,254 --> 00:21:27,382
until our son arrives.

172
00:21:30,928 --> 00:21:32,452
No, this doesn't taste
like normal mutton.

173
00:21:32,563 --> 00:21:36,897
I'm sure there is something the matter
with it. Could you take it away?

174
00:21:40,304 --> 00:21:42,670
Does it taste like normal mutton?

175
00:21:43,974 --> 00:21:47,432
Does it taste like normal mutton?
Come here.

176
00:21:49,313 --> 00:21:52,407
Think it tastes like normal mutton,
fussy dog?

177
00:21:52,516 --> 00:21:54,507
Who's a fussy mutton dog?

178
00:22:07,431 --> 00:22:09,490
Does your doll have a name?

179
00:22:14,371 --> 00:22:17,306
I bet you
she loves being in her new bedroom.

180
00:22:20,444 --> 00:22:24,380
You'll have to think of a name
and let me know tomorrow.

181
00:22:24,481 --> 00:22:27,678
Do you think
you'll be able to do that, Charlotte?

182
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,951
I...

183
00:22:31,054 --> 00:22:33,989
-Would you leave us, please?
-Your Grace.

184
00:22:46,637 --> 00:22:48,264
Hello, Charlotte.

185
00:22:54,378 --> 00:22:56,175
My name is Georgiana.

186
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,361
-Good evening.
-Thank you.

187
00:23:25,842 --> 00:23:27,639
Good evening, ladies.

188
00:23:31,248 --> 00:23:34,308
An inch more and I do believe
Your Grace will explode.

189
00:23:34,418 --> 00:23:37,649
Sheridan always knows
how to pay a compliment.

190
00:23:37,754 --> 00:23:39,312
Still a few more weeks to wait.

191
00:23:39,423 --> 00:23:42,415
A huge belly has never been
more becoming on anyone.

192
00:23:42,526 --> 00:23:46,553
Well, Fox, here, offers an expert opinion
seeing, as he does, a giant belly

193
00:23:46,663 --> 00:23:48,790
every time he passes a mirror.

194
00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:51,561
If your belly were on a woman, well,
we'd all know what to think.

195
00:23:51,668 --> 00:23:55,365
My dear Sheridan,
an hour ago my belly was on a woman.

196
00:23:55,472 --> 00:23:57,235
Now what do you think?

197
00:23:57,341 --> 00:24:01,471
That will teach you to insult Mr. Fox
before the gaming has begun.

198
00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:07,373
It's very good.

199
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:16,289
No more bets, please.

200
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,160
Seven.

201
00:24:26,003 --> 00:24:27,800
Her Grace wins again.

202
00:24:30,273 --> 00:24:31,763
Another wager?

203
00:24:33,577 --> 00:24:36,478
-Are you all right, Your Grace?
-Your Grace!

204
00:24:42,586 --> 00:24:45,612
Are those labor pains?
My wife is in labor.

205
00:24:46,323 --> 00:24:47,290
Come along.

206
00:24:47,391 --> 00:24:49,723
I think this calls for a toast.

207
00:24:49,826 --> 00:24:52,659
I may have an heir
before the night is out.

208
00:24:54,698 --> 00:24:57,565
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the sixth Duke of Devonshire.

209
00:24:57,668 --> 00:25:00,728
The sixth Duke of Devonshire!

210
00:25:26,496 --> 00:25:27,431
-Your Grace.
-I am in no mood for a conversation.

211
00:25:27,431 --> 00:25:30,264
-Your Grace.
-I am in no mood for a conversation.

212
00:25:30,367 --> 00:25:32,597
But, pray tell me, is my daughter...

213
00:25:32,703 --> 00:25:36,400
ls your daughter at all able
to give me a son?

214
00:25:36,506 --> 00:25:38,030
Take heart, Your Grace.

215
00:25:38,141 --> 00:25:39,802
As long as the mother is in good health,

216
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,901
consider this mishap a draft,

217
00:25:42,012 --> 00:25:44,446
a promise of what is soon to come.

218
00:25:44,981 --> 00:25:47,677
-In our family, we...
-Yes, I know, in your family,

219
00:25:47,784 --> 00:25:49,411
in your family.

220
00:25:52,622 --> 00:25:53,987
Your Grace.

221
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,596
Can you see the light? Can you see it?

222
00:26:08,505 --> 00:26:11,201
-Darling, how are you?
-Quite well.

223
00:26:12,476 --> 00:26:16,879
-ls she strong and healthy?
-She's perfect.

224
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:25,852
-Did William receive you?
-Yes.

225
00:26:27,491 --> 00:26:29,891
ls he upset that she's not a son?

226
00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:35,796
He just glanced at her and then left.
I've hardly seen him since.

227
00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:37,890
It's been a difficult time for His Grace,
my dear.

228
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:41,459
Many eyes are upon him
and not all of them kind.

229
00:26:44,841 --> 00:26:46,638
She is the loveliest.

230
00:26:49,346 --> 00:26:51,780
-Nurse?
-No, I will feed her.

231
00:26:51,882 --> 00:26:54,214
-Are you sure, darling?
-Yes.

232
00:26:58,288 --> 00:27:02,520
I am her mother, after all,
even if she is only a girl.

233
00:27:05,362 --> 00:27:06,329
There.

234
00:27:08,031 --> 00:27:09,760
Hell and damnation!

235
00:27:51,741 --> 00:27:53,436
It is always a pleasure

236
00:27:53,543 --> 00:27:57,445
when one is on holiday
to request a few words of wisdom.

237
00:27:57,547 --> 00:27:59,139
And so without further ado,

238
00:27:59,249 --> 00:28:03,948
it is a great honor to hand over
to our most distinguished guest.

239
00:28:04,054 --> 00:28:07,080
When she arrives,
all eyes are upon her.

240
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:11,217
When absent, she is the subject
of universal conversation.

241
00:28:11,328 --> 00:28:13,319
And what we see her wearing tonight,

242
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:17,389
I look forward to seeing
the rest of you wearing tomorrow!

243
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:22,597
The empress of fashion herself,
the Duchess of Devonshire.

244
00:28:31,915 --> 00:28:34,543
We come away to Bath
to get away from London,

245
00:28:34,651 --> 00:28:36,846
and all of London
has come away to Bath.

246
00:28:38,521 --> 00:28:40,318
Somebody did indeed ask me

247
00:28:40,423 --> 00:28:42,914
what kind of feather it is
that I'm wearing.

248
00:28:43,026 --> 00:28:47,053
Well, there are only two specimens
of this rare bird known to man.

249
00:28:47,163 --> 00:28:51,429
One of them has clearly ended up
on top of my head.

250
00:28:51,534 --> 00:28:55,800
And the other, rumor has it,
is running for office in the Tory Party.

251
00:29:20,397 --> 00:29:21,796
Bess Foster.

252
00:29:32,842 --> 00:29:34,173
Excuse me.

253
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:15,513
-I don't believe we've been introduced.
-No, we haven't. Lady Elizabeth Foster.

254
00:30:15,618 --> 00:30:20,146
-I saw you talking with my husband.
-Yes. He wanted to dance.

255
00:30:21,358 --> 00:30:26,352
That's not usually considered his forte.
And you declined?

256
00:30:27,597 --> 00:30:30,760
I'm ill at ease with male company
for the moment.

257
00:30:34,004 --> 00:30:35,335
Thank you.

258
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:38,432
So what brings you to Bath?

259
00:30:41,578 --> 00:30:45,275
My husband, Mr. Foster,
is enjoying his mistress in Bournemouth

260
00:30:45,382 --> 00:30:48,351
and I wanted some diversion. And you?

261
00:30:51,688 --> 00:30:54,521
The Duke is taking the waters
for his gout.

262
00:30:55,825 --> 00:30:58,020
-And I for my health.
-Really?

263
00:30:58,962 --> 00:31:02,363
I heard you were here
because you could not conceive a son.

264
00:31:02,465 --> 00:31:06,799
I beg your pardon,
that was an awful thing to say.

265
00:31:06,903 --> 00:31:08,598
It was the truth, at least.

266
00:31:08,705 --> 00:31:11,333
Trust me to say something silly.
I always do, you know.

267
00:31:11,441 --> 00:31:14,376
Then perhaps you should
have accepted the Duke's offer.

268
00:31:14,477 --> 00:31:16,445
You have much in common.

269
00:31:28,425 --> 00:31:31,053
Home, I think, Georgiana.

270
00:31:39,803 --> 00:31:43,330
-Where are you staying?
-I've rented some rooms in town.

271
00:31:44,574 --> 00:31:46,974
-We must meet again.
-We must.

272
00:32:03,893 --> 00:32:07,829
Harryo. Come here. Come here.
Did that hurt?

273
00:32:07,931 --> 00:32:10,422
-Mama.
-My angel.

274
00:32:11,434 --> 00:32:15,700
Are you sore? Was that sore?
Let me have a look. Was it this knee?

275
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,903
I think you shall live.

276
00:32:19,008 --> 00:32:23,502
Right. First to the bridge on my count.
One, two, three. Go.

277
00:32:23,613 --> 00:32:24,841
Come on, Harryo.

278
00:32:24,948 --> 00:32:28,111
-No, I'm gonna catch her!
-I'm gonna catch you!

279
00:32:28,218 --> 00:32:32,416
Up and down. Up and down.
Why can't we recover like that?

280
00:32:32,522 --> 00:32:34,490
It's too far to fall now.

281
00:32:34,591 --> 00:32:38,083
-Hello again.
-Hello. Your girls are lovely.

282
00:32:38,194 --> 00:32:43,188
-Thank you. Do you have any children?
-I do. Three boys.

283
00:32:44,134 --> 00:32:45,931
Three boys.

284
00:32:46,035 --> 00:32:48,936
What the Duke wouldn't give
for one of them.

285
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:57,478
-She is least like you, your eldest.
-Yes. I'm sure you know the story.

286
00:33:01,684 --> 00:33:05,051
My husband's daughter was born
before we married.

287
00:33:05,155 --> 00:33:09,114
Her mother was a maid.
The maid died, and we took the child.

288
00:33:09,225 --> 00:33:12,092
-I'm sorry. Have I spoken out of turn?
-No.

289
00:33:12,195 --> 00:33:15,892
It's the worst-kept secret in London.
She's nine years old now.

290
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:17,728
And you love her?

291
00:33:17,834 --> 00:33:20,735
Of course I do.
The same as all my children.

292
00:33:24,274 --> 00:33:26,538
Come and meet them.

293
00:33:26,643 --> 00:33:30,374
Girls. Come and meet my new friend,
Lady Elizabeth.

294
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,749
-Your Grace.
-Thank you. Thermal water.

295
00:33:42,792 --> 00:33:44,692
It's the sulfur
that makes it smell so bad.

296
00:33:44,794 --> 00:33:48,628
-And you really have to drink it?
-Twice a day for four weeks.

297
00:33:50,066 --> 00:33:54,127
Do you have any reason to believe
you cannot birth a male?

298
00:33:54,237 --> 00:33:57,764
No. Except miscarriages.

299
00:34:00,009 --> 00:34:02,136
Two stillbirths, both sons.

300
00:34:05,181 --> 00:34:07,046
But two healthy girls.

301
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,387
Everybody is staring at you.

302
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:28,867
What's that on your neck? Bess?

303
00:34:31,407 --> 00:34:34,240
It's not illegal for a man
to beat his wife with a stick

304
00:34:34,344 --> 00:34:37,336
unless the stick is thicker
than his thumb.

305
00:34:37,447 --> 00:34:41,406
Mr. Foster? But he can't have done that!

306
00:34:41,517 --> 00:34:44,111
Well, considering what else
he's done to me, that's not the worst.

307
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,653
What could possibly be worse?

308
00:34:45,755 --> 00:34:48,918
He's taken my children.
He won't let me see them.

309
00:34:55,298 --> 00:34:59,632
-And what do you propose to do?
-Really, I'm at my wits' end.

310
00:35:02,038 --> 00:35:04,165
The law supports Mr. Foster.

311
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:09,801
In the meantime, where shall you stay?

312
00:35:09,912 --> 00:35:12,710
Continue lodging,
till the money runs out.

313
00:35:16,786 --> 00:35:19,619
Well, there, at least, I think I can help.

314
00:35:26,963 --> 00:35:29,295
William? We leave tomorrow.

315
00:35:32,201 --> 00:35:36,399
And Lady Elizabeth doesn't have
to meet her parents on the continent

316
00:35:36,506 --> 00:35:38,701
for some time.

317
00:35:38,808 --> 00:35:43,677
-She hardly ever visits London at all.
-It's a pity, that.

318
00:35:46,549 --> 00:35:49,382
You see,
she doesn't have anywhere to stay.

319
00:35:52,388 --> 00:35:53,878
Problem there.

320
00:35:56,526 --> 00:36:01,054
Well, why doesn't she stay with us?
For a while, at least.

321
00:36:03,399 --> 00:36:04,730
Thank you.

322
00:36:10,306 --> 00:36:13,139
-This is incredible.
-There's the castle in lreland.

323
00:36:13,242 --> 00:36:18,544
Bolton Abbey, Chiswick, Burlington
and, why, in Chatsworth, of course.

324
00:36:18,648 --> 00:36:21,640
-Of course.
-Which is much bigger.

325
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:23,844
But this is more like home.

326
00:36:28,691 --> 00:36:31,216
I'm so glad you're here.

327
00:36:31,327 --> 00:36:34,023
I've arranged a wonderful start
to the season.

328
00:36:38,334 --> 00:36:42,236
May all the plagues of marriage
be doubled on me

329
00:36:42,338 --> 00:36:47,537
if ever I try to be friends
with you anymore!

330
00:36:47,643 --> 00:36:49,372
So much the better.

331
00:36:52,749 --> 00:36:56,708
No, no, madam.
'Tis evident you care not a pin for me!

332
00:36:57,253 --> 00:37:01,519
And I, I was a madman to marry you.

333
00:37:01,624 --> 00:37:05,958
And I'm sure I was a fool to marry you,

334
00:37:06,062 --> 00:37:09,429
an old dangling bachelor

335
00:37:12,301 --> 00:37:14,531
who was single at 50

336
00:37:14,637 --> 00:37:18,698
only because he never could meet
with anyone who could have him!

337
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:44,298
Bess, may I introduce Mr. Fox,
leader of the Opposition?

338
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,801
-Mr. Fox, Lady Elizabeth Foster.
-Mr. Fox.

339
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:52,000
-My protege, Charles Grey.
-Mr. Grey.

340
00:37:52,108 --> 00:37:53,735
-Mr. Grey.
-Your Grace.

341
00:37:53,843 --> 00:37:56,277
He's our newest bright young man.

342
00:37:56,379 --> 00:38:00,213
Scarcely out of Cambridge
and already a member of Parliament.

343
00:38:01,517 --> 00:38:04,350
-I always felt you'd do well.
-Thank you.

344
00:38:04,454 --> 00:38:06,684
-Mr. Fox.
-Yes, Lady Elizabeth.

345
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:13,686
-Did you enjoy the play?
-I must confess, I did not entirely.

346
00:38:15,631 --> 00:38:17,496
I hope that you've not lost
your sense of humor

347
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,160
-since entering politics.
-Not that I'm aware.

348
00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:21,861
<i>Then I'm sure you realize
that School for Scandal</i>

349
00:38:21,971 --> 00:38:24,997
-was written as a comedy.
-Yes.

350
00:38:25,107 --> 00:38:29,100
Although, from where I sat,
it read as a tragedy.

351
00:38:29,212 --> 00:38:33,148
Your Grace! How we have missed you.

352
00:38:33,249 --> 00:38:34,238
In your absence,

353
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:37,080
London has been reduced
to the dreariest province.

354
00:38:37,186 --> 00:38:39,916
And this, of course,
is the playwright Mr. Sheridan.

355
00:38:40,022 --> 00:38:42,320
May I present
the Lady Elizabeth Foster?

356
00:38:42,425 --> 00:38:43,551
I do not mean to be rude,

357
00:38:43,659 --> 00:38:45,820
but I've an entire cast
dying to meet the Duchess.

358
00:38:45,928 --> 00:38:48,658
I shall return you in a moment. Promise.

359
00:38:51,467 --> 00:38:52,434
-Mr. Fox?
-Yes.

360
00:38:52,535 --> 00:38:53,559
A word.

361
00:38:53,669 --> 00:38:58,299
Well, wherever do I glean
such domestic gossip?

362
00:38:58,407 --> 00:39:01,501
-Were we fair on the Duke?
-It could have been worse.

363
00:39:01,611 --> 00:39:04,307
<i>My original title was The Bad Marriage.</i>

364
00:39:08,284 --> 00:39:10,582
ls it always like this?

365
00:39:10,686 --> 00:39:12,483
Well, as they say,

366
00:39:12,588 --> 00:39:14,818
the Duke of Devonshire
must be the only man in England

367
00:39:14,924 --> 00:39:16,824
not in love with his wife.

368
00:39:18,694 --> 00:39:20,992
-Her Grace, the Duchess of Devonshire.
-Very pleased to meet you.

369
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,899
Were you at all able to forget things
and enjoy yourself?

370
00:39:33,009 --> 00:39:36,945
It was a wonderful distraction,
thank you.

371
00:39:37,046 --> 00:39:38,138
Good.

372
00:39:41,751 --> 00:39:45,152
-I talked to Mr. Grey all evening.
-Yes?

373
00:39:47,189 --> 00:39:48,679
He's in love with you.

374
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:53,854
My dear Bess, no, he is not.
Quite the reverse, I fear.

375
00:39:53,963 --> 00:39:57,660
Well, can't you tell
by the way he looks at you?

376
00:39:57,767 --> 00:40:00,702
-Honestly, can't you tell?
-Stop it.

377
00:40:03,205 --> 00:40:07,665
Georgiana,
intercourse is not just about offspring.

378
00:40:09,378 --> 00:40:14,577
-In fact, it can be rather pleasurable.
-Yes, I know.

379
00:40:17,453 --> 00:40:22,322
Close your eyes
and try to envisage Grey

380
00:40:22,425 --> 00:40:26,555
opening your dress, kissing your back.

381
00:40:26,662 --> 00:40:29,654
-They never do such things.
-Yes, they do.

382
00:40:37,306 --> 00:40:38,898
Close your eyes.

383
00:40:44,447 --> 00:40:49,146
Grey is behind you
slowly opening your dress.

384
00:40:49,251 --> 00:40:51,651
-No, Bess, stop!
-Close your eyes.

385
00:41:08,204 --> 00:41:09,865
Kissing your back.

386
00:41:32,862 --> 00:41:34,022
There.

387
00:41:35,297 --> 00:41:36,594
See?

388
00:42:09,198 --> 00:42:11,393
-Would you excuse me for a minute?
-You must excuse me, gentlemen.

389
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,934
-Your Grace.
-Mr. Grey.

390
00:42:14,036 --> 00:42:16,664
The national election
is in six weeks, yes?

391
00:42:16,772 --> 00:42:18,797
How is the campaign going?

392
00:42:21,677 --> 00:42:22,905
Terribly.

393
00:42:24,046 --> 00:42:27,538
Our only hope
is to save Westminster for Fox.

394
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,880
I have many faults, as you well know.

395
00:42:29,985 --> 00:42:33,614
Not least among them
is my ability to draw attention.

396
00:42:34,757 --> 00:42:37,590
Perhaps we could use that
to our advantage.

397
00:42:53,676 --> 00:42:55,473
Ladies and gentlemen.

398
00:42:57,179 --> 00:43:00,171
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the man

399
00:43:00,282 --> 00:43:02,978
who will inform us
of the work we must do

400
00:43:03,085 --> 00:43:07,715
and of the party we so believe in.
Mr. Charles Grey.

401
00:43:15,664 --> 00:43:19,031
Good people of Westminster!

402
00:43:19,135 --> 00:43:24,437
The world is on the brink of disaster
or salvation!

403
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,201
From France to America,

404
00:43:26,308 --> 00:43:29,300
men and women are struggling
to free themselves,

405
00:43:29,411 --> 00:43:32,812
to find meaning in their existence!

406
00:43:32,915 --> 00:43:35,406
Change is upon us!

407
00:43:37,887 --> 00:43:40,583
We shall not go back to the old ways.

408
00:43:40,689 --> 00:43:45,854
We shall take England
into this brave new world

409
00:43:45,961 --> 00:43:48,759
and shake the thunder from the skies!

410
00:44:01,811 --> 00:44:06,544
-How did I do?
-I think it was not an embarrassment.

411
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:10,280
It was a marvel.

412
00:44:10,386 --> 00:44:14,379
I was nervous. Your presence
trebled the numbers at least.

413
00:44:18,394 --> 00:44:20,191
I'm nervous even now.

414
00:44:22,331 --> 00:44:26,233
If we win this election,
if we get the power,

415
00:44:26,335 --> 00:44:28,303
think what we will do.

416
00:44:28,404 --> 00:44:31,202
Do you think of me
when we're not together?

417
00:44:32,408 --> 00:44:35,900
You ought to know I do.

418
00:44:36,011 --> 00:44:38,639
-You hesitated before you replied.
-No.

419
00:44:48,457 --> 00:44:51,085
I'm unused to being asked so directly.

420
00:44:54,496 --> 00:44:56,521
And by you, of all people.

421
00:44:59,635 --> 00:45:04,072
I think of you all the time. I always have.

422
00:45:10,746 --> 00:45:13,738
-Your carriage awaits, Your Grace.
-Thank you.

423
00:45:15,684 --> 00:45:18,016
...this we vow!

424
00:45:45,414 --> 00:45:48,577
What are you doing outside
Lady Elizabeth's room?

425
00:45:53,956 --> 00:45:55,924
Who's in there with her?

426
00:47:02,355 --> 00:47:08,351
Of all the women in England
you had to throw yourself on her.

427
00:47:12,565 --> 00:47:18,094
I have never once objected
to any of your affairs.

428
00:47:20,407 --> 00:47:24,468
I have accepted whatever arrangement
you have proposed.

429
00:47:26,112 --> 00:47:29,775
I have raised Charlotte
as my own daughter.

430
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:34,184
But this...

431
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:41,420
I have one single thing of my own.

432
00:47:44,664 --> 00:47:47,861
Why couldn't you let me keep Elizabeth
for myself?

433
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:52,898
What kind of man are you?

434
00:47:56,042 --> 00:48:01,742
She is my sole comfort in our marriage.
You have robbed me of my only friend!

435
00:48:11,224 --> 00:48:13,089
What is wrong with me?

436
00:48:38,485 --> 00:48:39,543
I...

437
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:47,959
I've never claimed
to be a man of fine sensibility, G.

438
00:48:48,061 --> 00:48:51,326
But I've always known
what I expect from this marriage

439
00:48:51,431 --> 00:48:53,661
and what I'm prepared to give.

440
00:48:54,934 --> 00:48:58,927
As a husband,
I have fulfilled my obligations.

441
00:48:59,038 --> 00:49:02,303
But, as a wife,

442
00:49:04,677 --> 00:49:06,804
you have not.

443
00:49:06,913 --> 00:49:10,314
She has to go. Now.

444
00:49:10,416 --> 00:49:13,010
She is never to set foot
in this house again!

445
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:15,053
Do mind your temper, G.
You're forgetting yourself.

446
00:49:16,523 --> 00:49:18,047
I want her out.

447
00:49:20,293 --> 00:49:25,026
I never want to lay eyes on her again.
Go down and tell her to leave at once.

448
00:49:29,636 --> 00:49:31,570
I couldn't ask her that.

449
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,867
I won't do it, G.

450
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:58,358
-I never liked her from the first.
-You made that quite clear, Mama.

451
00:49:58,464 --> 00:50:01,194
She's gone from Devonshire House,
I hope.

452
00:50:05,271 --> 00:50:07,262
They're living there together?

453
00:50:07,373 --> 00:50:09,705
Georgiana!
What have you permitted to happen?

454
00:50:09,809 --> 00:50:13,438
I don't know. I don't know.

455
00:50:13,546 --> 00:50:17,243
Help me. Help me, please, Mama.
Tell me what to do.

456
00:50:21,754 --> 00:50:25,850
You must write to your husband
and insist he send her back

457
00:50:25,959 --> 00:50:28,120
to whatever horrid little place
she came from.

458
00:50:28,228 --> 00:50:32,995
He will not.
''It is out of the question,'' he says.

459
00:50:38,738 --> 00:50:42,572
Then you must return
and resume your duties.

460
00:50:42,675 --> 00:50:45,200
Make him realize whom he loves.

461
00:50:45,311 --> 00:50:48,075
You will give up your politics
and your gambling.

462
00:50:48,181 --> 00:50:51,480
For once,
you will devote yourself as a loving wife

463
00:50:51,584 --> 00:50:55,543
and settle down to the task in hand,
providing him with an heir.

464
00:50:56,956 --> 00:50:59,186
Then he will soon tire of her.

465
00:51:08,001 --> 00:51:09,992
You have no other option.

466
00:51:48,941 --> 00:51:50,238
Hello, G.

467
00:51:52,512 --> 00:51:53,740
William.

468
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:31,173
I may not have the authority
to remove you from my house,

469
00:52:31,284 --> 00:52:33,912
but I can, at least,
order you out of my room.

470
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,386
Won't you please let me explain?

471
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:39,048
There is nothing to explain.

472
00:52:39,158 --> 00:52:42,650
This is my only chance
of ever seeing my children again.

473
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:46,125
The Duke is the most powerful peer
in England.

474
00:52:46,232 --> 00:52:47,460
He is my only chance.

475
00:52:47,567 --> 00:52:51,503
There are limits to the sacrifices
one makes for one's children.

476
00:52:51,604 --> 00:52:55,700
No, there aren't. No limits whatsoever.

477
00:52:58,845 --> 00:53:00,073
Get out.

478
00:53:04,016 --> 00:53:06,985
We have nothing more
to say to one another.

479
00:53:59,906 --> 00:54:01,237
Mama, Mama!

480
00:54:08,648 --> 00:54:11,208
It's so nice to see you, Mama.

481
00:54:11,317 --> 00:54:13,877
Right, this is a shotgun.

482
00:54:13,986 --> 00:54:15,920
Your mother said
you'd be interested, yes?

483
00:54:16,022 --> 00:54:17,046
Yes.

484
00:54:18,658 --> 00:54:20,353
This is a flint. Do you see?

485
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:23,486
When the flint hits there,
it causes a spark to happen.

486
00:54:23,596 --> 00:54:29,466
Now, the spark, it lights the gunpowder
and sends the bullet out of the gun.

487
00:54:29,569 --> 00:54:31,696
-Do you know how to hold it?
-No, sir.

488
00:54:31,804 --> 00:54:37,208
Well, it's like that.
Tuck it in there, into your right shoulder.

489
00:54:37,343 --> 00:54:40,972
Hold it firmly, then you can move
that hand a little further along.

490
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:45,107
Can you feel how heavy it is?
You have to lean into it a bit.

491
00:54:45,218 --> 00:54:49,177
And keep both eyes open.
Look right along the barrel.

492
00:54:49,288 --> 00:54:51,654
Right along there just like that.

493
00:54:53,626 --> 00:54:57,528
Bang! Here, let me show you.

494
00:55:01,234 --> 00:55:02,565
There.

495
00:55:03,469 --> 00:55:05,596
It's quite heavy, isn't it?

496
00:55:06,939 --> 00:55:10,932
Are you thirsty?
Would you like something to drink?

497
00:55:11,043 --> 00:55:14,570
Are you gentlemen thirsty?
Would you like something to drink?

498
00:55:16,816 --> 00:55:18,147
Thank you.

499
00:56:11,971 --> 00:56:14,098
Did you tell the Duke
who you were meeting?

500
00:56:14,206 --> 00:56:15,230
No.

501
00:56:16,108 --> 00:56:18,042
-Did he even ask?
-No.

502
00:56:19,178 --> 00:56:21,339
He has other things on his mind.

503
00:56:23,049 --> 00:56:24,448
As do you.

504
00:56:28,888 --> 00:56:31,356
Would it help to unburden yourself?

505
00:56:34,126 --> 00:56:36,617
It's nothing I can discuss with you.

506
00:56:38,531 --> 00:56:40,624
Besides, it would only bore.

507
00:56:41,567 --> 00:56:44,502
You don't have to please others
all the time.

508
00:56:44,604 --> 00:56:48,631
It's what I've been brought up to do.
Difficult lesson to unlearn.

509
00:56:52,211 --> 00:56:54,679
Would you permit me an observation?

510
00:56:58,985 --> 00:57:02,113
I believe you do it
so that people will love you.

511
00:57:02,955 --> 00:57:06,015
-What makes you say that?
-From what I've seen.

512
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,788
With your husband, your friends,
especially Lady Bess,

513
00:57:15,034 --> 00:57:16,626
even the public.

514
00:57:18,771 --> 00:57:21,365
I never thought of it that way before.

515
00:57:23,342 --> 00:57:25,537
You make me sound so pitiable.

516
00:57:31,417 --> 00:57:32,714
Georgiana.

517
00:57:34,954 --> 00:57:38,720
I've gone beyond my brief. I apologize.

518
00:57:40,626 --> 00:57:44,027
Please believe
it was only for your sake that I spoke.

519
00:57:45,331 --> 00:57:47,526
Please, tell me what is wrong.

520
00:57:52,138 --> 00:57:55,972
I fear I've done
some things in life too late

521
00:57:56,075 --> 00:57:57,906
and others too early.

522
00:58:02,548 --> 00:58:04,140
No, you haven't.

523
00:58:19,732 --> 00:58:21,063
I'm sorry.

524
00:58:59,071 --> 00:59:00,402
Thank you.

525
00:59:17,089 --> 00:59:18,420
All right.

526
00:59:21,761 --> 00:59:23,126
''All right''?

527
00:59:26,665 --> 00:59:28,565
Do you love each other?

528
00:59:31,303 --> 00:59:35,433
-Georgiana...
-Do you love Bess, Your Grace?

529
00:59:37,109 --> 00:59:40,601
-Where is all this leading?
-I make no demands on him.

530
00:59:42,948 --> 00:59:47,009
-And, Bess, do you love my husband?
-As I do you.

531
00:59:50,089 --> 00:59:52,114
And so you intend to stay?

532
00:59:55,161 --> 00:59:57,254
William has asked that I do.

533
00:59:58,664 --> 01:00:01,827
You couldn't find it in your heart
to refuse him?

534
01:00:04,069 --> 01:00:05,161
No.

535
01:00:09,508 --> 01:00:10,810
Then let us make a deal.

536
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:11,435
Then let us make a deal.

537
01:00:12,378 --> 01:00:15,006
-A deal?
-Yes.

538
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:21,047
I give you my blessing

539
01:00:21,153 --> 01:00:25,021
if you will accept my feelings
for Charles Grey.

540
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,152
I didn't realize it at first.

541
01:00:29,261 --> 01:00:32,788
I thought that perhaps
it was only a dalliance.

542
01:00:34,266 --> 01:00:36,063
It can make me happy.

543
01:00:40,973 --> 01:00:43,771
A deal? A deal.

544
01:00:45,344 --> 01:00:47,107
I don't make deals.

545
01:00:48,247 --> 01:00:49,680
Why would I?

546
01:00:52,218 --> 01:00:53,412
I'm in charge of it all.

547
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:58,081
You know, I would call him out.
I would challenge him.

548
01:00:58,190 --> 01:00:59,817
-I'd put a bullet in his head.
-William.

549
01:00:59,925 --> 01:01:04,021
Be quiet. Are you determined
to make me a total laughingstock?

550
01:01:04,129 --> 01:01:06,859
A man who cannot sire a son,
and then a cuckold?

551
01:01:06,966 --> 01:01:09,127
William. Georgiana only asks
what we ourselves...

552
01:01:09,235 --> 01:01:10,827
Be quiet, woman!

553
01:01:12,972 --> 01:01:15,532
-Are you his whore?
-No.

554
01:01:16,809 --> 01:01:18,970
But I can't see why you'd mind.

555
01:01:19,078 --> 01:01:22,479
-You have Bess and three boys!
-Three boys?

556
01:01:24,683 --> 01:01:27,777
Do you think
I can make those bastards my heirs?

557
01:01:29,622 --> 01:01:31,453
Well? Do you?

558
01:01:41,634 --> 01:01:42,896
William!

559
01:02:15,167 --> 01:02:17,158
You don't know me in the least, do you?

560
01:02:17,269 --> 01:02:19,066
Yes, I do. We're a bad match.

561
01:02:19,171 --> 01:02:23,369
I asked but two things when we wed,
loyalty and a male heir.

562
01:02:23,475 --> 01:02:25,841
The same as your dogs!

563
01:02:29,982 --> 01:02:33,975
No, don't touch me! Don't touch me!

564
01:02:37,022 --> 01:02:38,319
Get off!

565
01:02:44,163 --> 01:02:45,960
Get off me!

566
01:02:46,065 --> 01:02:50,399
ls this how you treat her?
ls this how you treat your whore?

567
01:02:50,502 --> 01:02:52,527
No! No!

568
01:02:53,706 --> 01:02:56,732
No! No! No!

569
01:02:57,609 --> 01:02:58,871
No!

570
01:03:03,048 --> 01:03:05,642
Come with me.
Charlotte, come with me.

571
01:03:06,819 --> 01:03:08,446
No! No!

572
01:03:31,043 --> 01:03:37,278
Give me a son.
Until then, stay here and do as I say.

573
01:03:53,766 --> 01:03:59,705
I give you the winner.
Mr. Fox, the man of the people!

574
01:04:06,578 --> 01:04:12,414
And I give you the weapon,
the Duchess of Devonshire.

575
01:04:24,463 --> 01:04:26,055
Thank you.

576
01:04:26,165 --> 01:04:30,693
Thank you, all of you,
for this reception today.

577
01:04:32,704 --> 01:04:39,075
Today we have won the vote.
Tomorrow we define the future!

578
01:04:51,356 --> 01:04:53,324
-Your Grace.
-Your Grace.

579
01:04:56,862 --> 01:04:59,057
-Your Grace.
-Your Grace.

580
01:05:02,434 --> 01:05:03,731
Your Grace.

581
01:05:09,842 --> 01:05:11,332
-Your Grace.
-Your Grace.

582
01:05:31,964 --> 01:05:34,865
Will Your Grace give me
the favor of a dance?

583
01:05:58,657 --> 01:05:59,988
Steady, G.

584
01:06:04,796 --> 01:06:07,321
-Fire!
-Georgiana!

585
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,458
Your Grace!

586
01:06:09,935 --> 01:06:11,425
Her Grace's hair!

587
01:06:14,406 --> 01:06:15,737
Do something!

588
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:29,885
Please put out Her Grace's hair.

589
01:07:05,657 --> 01:07:07,682
Her Grace needs to rest.

590
01:07:07,793 --> 01:07:09,852
As long as she follows
strict instructions

591
01:07:09,962 --> 01:07:12,931
there should be no impediment
to the birth.

592
01:07:13,031 --> 01:07:15,090
What are you talking about?

593
01:07:16,068 --> 01:07:18,127
The Duchess is pregnant.

594
01:07:49,434 --> 01:07:50,765
And there.

595
01:07:54,139 --> 01:07:55,766
Thank you, Heaton.

596
01:07:59,678 --> 01:08:00,872
Come.

597
01:08:13,058 --> 01:08:14,423
Your Grace.

598
01:08:16,061 --> 01:08:20,589
As per the terms of
His Grace's inheritance, this is for you

599
01:08:21,667 --> 01:08:23,464
to spend as you wish.

600
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:29,767
Success at last.

601
01:08:38,483 --> 01:08:39,780
Georgiana.

602
01:08:42,087 --> 01:08:45,113
I, too, abhor this whole thing.

603
01:09:04,576 --> 01:09:06,100
Twist or stick?

604
01:09:07,546 --> 01:09:09,844
-Stick.
-Stick?

605
01:09:10,816 --> 01:09:12,647
I'll stick, too, then.

606
01:09:14,553 --> 01:09:15,918
Let's see.

607
01:09:16,788 --> 01:09:18,517
You won. Well done.

608
01:09:19,591 --> 01:09:20,819
Come on.

609
01:09:23,495 --> 01:09:24,689
Come on.

610
01:09:26,732 --> 01:09:27,790
Come on.

611
01:09:33,638 --> 01:09:35,663
Mama, you forgot to deal.

612
01:09:55,193 --> 01:09:57,684
-Your Grace.
-Mr. Grey.

613
01:09:59,731 --> 01:10:02,791
-You are recalled from France?
-For a while.

614
01:10:02,901 --> 01:10:04,528
No revolution yet?

615
01:10:06,004 --> 01:10:08,871
No, not yet,
but it's only a matter of time.

616
01:10:11,543 --> 01:10:15,639
-How is it you are here?
-I received an invitation.

617
01:10:17,482 --> 01:10:21,612
I assumed it was on behalf of the Party.
I could not say no.

618
01:10:21,753 --> 01:10:23,084
Of course.

619
01:10:30,429 --> 01:10:31,896
I bore a son.

620
01:10:34,699 --> 01:10:35,825
Yes.

621
01:10:38,136 --> 01:10:41,697
His name is
William George Spencer Cavendish,

622
01:10:41,807 --> 01:10:46,506
Marquis of Hartington.
We call him Hart.

623
01:10:46,611 --> 01:10:48,875
You and the Duke must be very pleased.

624
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:50,242
We are.

625
01:10:54,219 --> 01:10:56,983
The Duke has gone to London
to celebrate.

626
01:11:03,028 --> 01:11:04,791
You have been missed.

627
01:11:07,732 --> 01:11:09,165
Much missed.

628
01:11:16,408 --> 01:11:18,535
-Ten on the Queen.
-Four on five.

629
01:11:18,643 --> 01:11:20,611
And no more bets, please.

630
01:11:23,615 --> 01:11:26,709
The losing card, four.

631
01:11:29,788 --> 01:11:32,484
The winning card, Queen.

632
01:11:58,817 --> 01:12:01,217
Jolly good. Eight on the three.

633
01:12:01,319 --> 01:12:03,082
Put five on the five.

634
01:12:05,156 --> 01:12:07,386
All of the fives have gone, G.

635
01:12:10,695 --> 01:12:12,890
I think I'm too tired to play.

636
01:12:15,967 --> 01:12:18,231
-Gentlemen.
-Your Grace.

637
01:12:30,181 --> 01:12:31,512
Georgiana.

638
01:12:33,418 --> 01:12:35,079
No one must know.

639
01:12:36,488 --> 01:12:39,286
-You summoned Grey.
-Good night.

640
01:14:40,311 --> 01:14:42,779
I was thinking about going to Bath.

641
01:14:46,885 --> 01:14:53,381
Bess, you can stay here and look after
our husband whilst I take the cure.

642
01:14:55,193 --> 01:14:57,559
Yes, William. Why not?

643
01:14:57,662 --> 01:15:01,257
If G goes now, we can catch up with her
when you're free.

644
01:15:02,467 --> 01:15:04,162
Well, if you must.

645
01:15:17,248 --> 01:15:21,378
''The Duchess of Devonshire appeared
last week in Bath in a mobcap.

646
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:25,651
''Her Grace, ever since initiation
into the business of electioneering,

647
01:15:25,757 --> 01:15:27,622
''has been much attached to the mobs.''

648
01:15:27,726 --> 01:15:29,353
Very good.

649
01:15:33,064 --> 01:15:35,294
So which one is your favorite?

650
01:15:38,503 --> 01:15:40,698
-This one.
-Yeah.

651
01:15:42,941 --> 01:15:46,172
In this one it seems
you've hit a winning streak, for once.

652
01:15:46,277 --> 01:15:47,642
Very good.

653
01:15:50,448 --> 01:15:52,973
And in this one you see...

654
01:15:53,084 --> 01:15:56,884
ls that dress really an appropriate way
to attract voters?

655
01:15:56,988 --> 01:16:00,424
You politicians know absolutely nothing
about fashion.

656
01:16:01,926 --> 01:16:05,362
But if you were to really ask me
which my favorite was,

657
01:16:07,165 --> 01:16:09,133
I'd say it was this one.

658
01:16:23,748 --> 01:16:25,841
-Morning, Charles.
-Morning.

659
01:16:25,950 --> 01:16:27,383
Good day to you, sir.

660
01:16:53,044 --> 01:16:55,706
It's perfect. Thank you.

661
01:17:21,239 --> 01:17:23,605
Thought we would surprise you, G.

662
01:17:23,741 --> 01:17:26,574
I think you once said there wasn't
enough spontaneity in our marriage

663
01:17:26,678 --> 01:17:28,646
or words to that effect.

664
01:17:32,183 --> 01:17:34,413
Mama, what are you doing here?

665
01:17:36,054 --> 01:17:40,423
So, have you seen
many of our circle in Bath?

666
01:17:42,193 --> 01:17:43,319
Some.

667
01:17:44,629 --> 01:17:49,965
The Cokes and Haverford
and Lord Wicklow.

668
01:17:50,068 --> 01:17:53,595
Bunch of politicos, too, aren't there?
Meetings and such.

669
01:17:54,606 --> 01:17:55,595
I believe.

670
01:17:55,707 --> 01:18:00,144
ls Grey here?
By which I mean Mr. Charles Grey.

671
01:18:01,079 --> 01:18:03,206
Rumor has it that he is.

672
01:18:03,314 --> 01:18:05,043
-I won't give him up.
-Georgiana.

673
01:18:05,149 --> 01:18:08,312
Everyone has a lover.
Bess is the lover of my husband.

674
01:18:08,419 --> 01:18:10,080
If you had shown some discretion,

675
01:18:10,188 --> 01:18:12,588
-it might have been different.
-Different?

676
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:15,124
The only good fortune is
it hasn't yet made it to the papers.

677
01:18:15,226 --> 01:18:19,060
My dear, Grey is unmarried.
He has no wealth, no rank.

678
01:18:19,163 --> 01:18:22,599
He risks nothing with this affair.
The hazard is all yours.

679
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:25,533
-Grey loves me.
-So does William.

680
01:18:25,637 --> 01:18:29,038
Yes. I love you.

681
01:18:30,675 --> 01:18:31,903
How?

682
01:18:33,711 --> 01:18:36,305
In the way I understand love.

683
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:44,049
Georgiana, this has gone much too far.
It is beneath our dignity.

684
01:18:44,155 --> 01:18:46,521
-All London is talking.
-Let them talk.

685
01:18:46,624 --> 01:18:49,149
If Grey makes me a fallen woman,
well and good.

686
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:51,751
Now William may divorce me and
Bess becomes Duchess of Devonshire.

687
01:18:51,863 --> 01:18:53,728
That will never happen.

688
01:18:55,934 --> 01:18:58,266
I think I will leave you to it.

689
01:19:03,808 --> 01:19:06,003
What follows now?

690
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:09,375
Are you going to tear my clothes off
and force yourself upon me again?

691
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:11,675
Why on earth would I do that?

692
01:19:12,583 --> 01:19:17,850
I know that you've never thought much
of my manners or my intellect, G.

693
01:19:18,923 --> 01:19:23,087
But, in fact, I never do anything
that serves no purpose.

694
01:19:23,194 --> 01:19:26,061
I know precisely
what you two have together.

695
01:19:26,164 --> 01:19:27,995
-We love each other.
-I do not doubt it.

696
01:19:28,099 --> 01:19:29,794
He is a dreamer like yourself,

697
01:19:29,901 --> 01:19:34,497
and you both dream of another world
that does not exist and it never will.

698
01:19:34,605 --> 01:19:38,234
As for reality, allow me to enlighten you.

699
01:19:39,444 --> 01:19:43,244
If you do not give him up at once,
I will see to it

700
01:19:43,348 --> 01:19:47,808
that every home and every checkbook
in this country is closed to him.

701
01:19:47,919 --> 01:19:50,752
He will be welcomed
neither in the halls of government

702
01:19:50,855 --> 01:19:53,449
nor in its backrooms of power.

703
01:19:53,558 --> 01:19:56,356
His dream of becoming prime minister

704
01:19:56,494 --> 01:20:02,831
and your mutual fantasy
of a changed world will be dead as ash.

705
01:20:06,804 --> 01:20:09,671
And you will never
see your children again.

706
01:20:19,183 --> 01:20:20,514
Georgiana.

707
01:21:05,897 --> 01:21:08,229
I must ask you to return to London.

708
01:21:08,332 --> 01:21:10,300
-Without you?
-Yes.

709
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:21,210
These are from our girls.

710
01:21:21,312 --> 01:21:25,578
Little Hart neglected to write,
but then, of course, he's not yet one.

711
01:21:37,095 --> 01:21:41,054
-This will be the mistake of your life.
-No.

712
01:21:43,568 --> 01:21:45,695
I made that many years ago.

713
01:21:48,773 --> 01:21:51,139
I trust you can see yourself out.

714
01:22:11,529 --> 01:22:14,362
-Damn you, man, open the door!
-Your Grace.

715
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:15,742
Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama!

716
01:24:20,324 --> 01:24:22,087
Mama, Mama, Mama.

717
01:24:40,611 --> 01:24:43,944
-Come on, girls.
-Mama. I love you.

718
01:24:44,048 --> 01:24:47,848
Girls, run along.
Your mother will join you in a minute.

719
01:24:47,952 --> 01:24:49,180
Come on.

720
01:24:52,323 --> 01:24:53,654
Run along.

721
01:24:58,095 --> 01:24:59,119
G.

722
01:25:13,411 --> 01:25:15,174
You must know
how greatly pleased I am

723
01:25:15,279 --> 01:25:18,305
that we have come to an arrangement.

724
01:25:18,416 --> 01:25:22,512
It's not good for little ones
to be without their mother for so long.

725
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:26,283
-My life for theirs.
-That's one way of putting it.

726
01:25:28,959 --> 01:25:32,986
Your mother called it ''common decency
before personal gratification,''

727
01:25:33,097 --> 01:25:35,930
or some such thing.
The exact words escape me.

728
01:25:36,033 --> 01:25:39,730
How about
''imprisoned in my own house''?

729
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:45,102
No. That's not how she put it.

730
01:25:47,044 --> 01:25:49,013
I would have remembered that.

731
01:25:49,013 --> 01:25:49,240
I would have remembered that.

732
01:26:13,804 --> 01:26:15,431
Georgiana!

733
01:26:15,539 --> 01:26:18,372
Unhand me!

734
01:26:18,476 --> 01:26:19,773
Georgiana!

735
01:26:23,547 --> 01:26:27,415
Georgiana! Will you please unhand me?

736
01:26:27,518 --> 01:26:28,849
Excuse me.

737
01:26:36,026 --> 01:26:38,586
Georgiana! Please.

738
01:26:40,297 --> 01:26:41,628
Georgiana!

739
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:45,668
-Thank you, Burleigh.
-Let him go.

740
01:26:47,505 --> 01:26:53,205
I have written a dozen times a day.
Still, there is nothing from you.

741
01:26:53,310 --> 01:26:56,837
What has happened?
Do you love me no longer?

742
01:26:58,315 --> 01:27:02,752
-My personal feelings remain unaltered.
-Then we must be together again.

743
01:27:02,853 --> 01:27:05,447
I want to marry you.
I want you to bear my children.

744
01:27:05,556 --> 01:27:07,251
And I don't care if they're boys or girls!

745
01:27:07,358 --> 01:27:10,759
-I wish it could be that way.
-It can. It will.

746
01:27:11,996 --> 01:27:14,021
Sorrows will come
however we try to avoid them.

747
01:27:14,131 --> 01:27:16,361
We must stay the course
and never give in.

748
01:27:16,467 --> 01:27:19,231
-No, Charles.
-You must leave and be with me.

749
01:27:19,336 --> 01:27:21,497
A free woman. Now! Let us leave now!

750
01:27:21,605 --> 01:27:24,335
I cannot abandon my children.

751
01:27:27,611 --> 01:27:30,307
Listen to what you are asking me to do.

752
01:28:23,467 --> 01:28:26,959
What's the matter?
Don't like the pigeon?

753
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:31,205
I find it quite decent.

754
01:28:38,883 --> 01:28:41,545
I'm carrying Charles Grey's child.

755
01:28:54,865 --> 01:28:58,460
Please be so kind as to inform
the Duchess of my decision.

756
01:29:00,504 --> 01:29:02,734
This is how it will be.

757
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:06,776
You will be taken to the country
where you will give birth to the child,

758
01:29:06,877 --> 01:29:10,973
and the child will be trusted
to the care of Charles Grey's family.

759
01:29:15,119 --> 01:29:16,780
Are you listening?

760
01:29:17,788 --> 01:29:19,779
I think she's heard you. Let's leave her.

761
01:29:19,890 --> 01:29:21,881
-Georgiana, please.
-I said let's leave.

762
01:29:22,026 --> 01:29:24,426
This is not a discussion.
She's been informed of my decision.

763
01:29:24,528 --> 01:29:26,496
-Have pity on her, William.
-Pity be damned.

764
01:29:26,597 --> 01:29:28,929
She's brought this upon herself,
as well you know.

765
01:29:29,033 --> 01:29:32,025
-Now come.
-No. I will go with her.

766
01:29:33,137 --> 01:29:34,695
But you're not going anywhere.

767
01:29:34,805 --> 01:29:36,500
I will go with G, if G will have me,

768
01:29:36,607 --> 01:29:40,407
and there's nothing you can do or say
to stop either of us.

769
01:30:33,864 --> 01:30:37,459
-Thank you for coming.
-I couldn't not be with you.

770
01:31:15,039 --> 01:31:16,404
It's time.

771
01:31:20,711 --> 01:31:23,339
-Would it help...
-No, I must take her.

772
01:32:46,764 --> 01:32:50,063
Your Grace, I'm General Grey.

773
01:32:52,936 --> 01:32:54,494
Where's Charles?

774
01:32:55,405 --> 01:32:58,670
Your husband thought it best
if I took care of this.

775
01:33:36,446 --> 01:33:37,936
General Grey.

776
01:33:40,651 --> 01:33:42,312
Her name is Eliza.

777
01:33:54,331 --> 01:33:55,628
Come on.

778
01:34:07,077 --> 01:34:12,014
Come on, G. I've got you. I've got you.

779
01:35:37,701 --> 01:35:41,262
I'm not particularly adept
at expressing myself

780
01:35:41,371 --> 01:35:45,137
when it comes to matters
of a more personal nature.

781
01:35:47,978 --> 01:35:49,570
But I shall try.

782
01:35:52,582 --> 01:35:55,449
Over the years, I have acted in ways

783
01:35:55,552 --> 01:35:59,818
that you have judged to be harsh.

784
01:36:03,894 --> 01:36:07,330
Well, I do not wish for you
to undergo any further suffering.

785
01:36:09,333 --> 01:36:15,465
In fact, I would like our lives
to find a calm normality.

786
01:36:25,282 --> 01:36:27,443
Lady Melbourne has arranged
a small gathering

787
01:36:27,551 --> 01:36:30,584
in honor of your recent return
from holiday.

788
01:36:30,621 --> 01:36:34,382
And given some of the vague reports
that have been circulating this past year

789
01:36:34,383 --> 01:36:36,483
I think it'd be wise for us to go.

790
01:36:39,262 --> 01:36:41,492
A show of unity, so to speak.

791
01:36:45,335 --> 01:36:46,962
Who will be there?

792
01:36:49,272 --> 01:36:50,603
Everybody.

793
01:37:01,752 --> 01:37:03,117
As you wish.

794
01:37:48,698 --> 01:37:50,928
How wonderful to be that free.

795
01:38:07,617 --> 01:38:08,982
Come here.

796
01:38:16,393 --> 01:38:20,659
Come here. Little G, come here.

797
01:38:35,112 --> 01:38:39,105
The Duke and Duchess of Devonshire
and Lady Elizabeth Foster.

798
01:38:52,295 --> 01:38:53,626
-Your Grace.
-It's lovely to see you.

799
01:38:53,730 --> 01:38:55,721
Welcome back, Your Grace.

800
01:38:59,136 --> 01:39:00,467
Excuse me.

801
01:39:01,304 --> 01:39:04,569
-Welcome back.
-Welcome home, Your Grace.

802
01:39:04,674 --> 01:39:07,575
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back, G.

803
01:39:07,677 --> 01:39:10,237
Your presence has been sorely missed.

804
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:51,949
Would you excuse me?

805
01:39:55,492 --> 01:39:57,960
-Mr. Grey.
-Your Grace.

806
01:40:01,364 --> 01:40:03,662
I trust your tour was enjoyable.

807
01:40:05,235 --> 01:40:06,759
Yes.

808
01:40:06,870 --> 01:40:10,738
We spent the summer in Switzerland
and the winter in Nice.

809
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:12,933
Well, I speak on behalf of everybody

810
01:40:13,043 --> 01:40:16,945
when I say how glad I am
that you have arrived home safely.

811
01:40:21,318 --> 01:40:23,513
And what news with you?

812
01:40:25,822 --> 01:40:27,483
I'm to be engaged.

813
01:40:30,427 --> 01:40:32,088
To Lady Ponsonby.

814
01:40:33,997 --> 01:40:36,557
The announcement will follow shortly.

815
01:40:38,201 --> 01:40:39,896
Congratulations.

816
01:40:43,273 --> 01:40:47,004
And I have a niece, Eliza,

817
01:40:50,380 --> 01:40:52,280
who is very much loved.

818
01:41:00,690 --> 01:41:03,181
One day you should come
and meet her,

819
01:41:04,427 --> 01:41:06,088
in a little while.

820
01:41:08,231 --> 01:41:09,892
If you would like.

821
01:41:12,869 --> 01:41:14,996
I would like that very much.

822
01:42:39,356 --> 01:42:41,290
Who's going to catch me first?

823
01:42:44,794 --> 01:42:46,318
-Me!
-Quick, girls.

824
01:42:46,429 --> 01:42:49,398
Quick, I'm going to get away!

825
01:42:49,499 --> 01:42:54,562
Come on, girls, keep running.

826
01:43:04,481 --> 01:43:07,279
And I love you, and I love you.
