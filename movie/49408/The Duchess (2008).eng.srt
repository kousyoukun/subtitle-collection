1
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,214
Lord Thomas.

2
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:27,250
Lord Henry.

3
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,216
Lord Ambrose.

4
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,024
Lord Robert.

5
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:37,928
Lord Walter.

6
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,800
You'd better not let me down,
Charles Grey.

7
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:48,033
- I've got 20 guineas riding on you.
- Only 20? I'd double that if I were you.

8
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,007
Come on,
ladies.

9
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:02,382
Gentlemen, twice around the course,
on my count.

10
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,853
Three, two,

11
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,391
one!

12
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,021
- Come on, Mr. Grey!
- Come on, Thomas!

13
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,101
- Come on, Mr. Grey!
- Run, Lord Walter!

14
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,466
Come on, Mr. Grey!

15
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,232
Come on, Mr. Grey.
You're tired already.

16
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,900
- Come on, Mr. Grey!
- Faster!

17
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:40,514
I trust Your Grace still finds Georgiana
an attractive girl?

18
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,618
Of course, Lady Spencer.

19
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:46,563
She's an accomplished lady of quality
and devoted to her duties.

20
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,294
She's fluent in French, Italian, Latin

21
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:52,200
and fully versed in horsemanship
and dancing and...

22
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:56,173
Yes, I'm aware of all that.
She's a credit to you.

23
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,841
I can't think of anything
that would stand in the way

24
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,107
of a singularly happy marriage.

25
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:05,514
These are not the issues
that burden the Duke, Lady Spencer.

26
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:08,815
It is His Grace's duty to produce an heir.

27
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,287
On the other hand,
your daughter may expect

28
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,858
a handsome reward when that occurs.

29
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,258
- Thank you, Heaton.
- Your Grace.

30
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,295
Your Grace may rest assured.

31
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,857
The women in our family
have never forfeited on that account.

32
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,764
Well, with that assurance...

33
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,573
So be it, then.

34
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,616
Come on, Mr. Grey!

35
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:53,861
I do apologize, ladies,
but it appears that my horse has won.

36
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,197
Beat me again, Charles.

37
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:03,003
- Well done, Mr. Grey.
- Well done.

38
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,701
- So how much do we owe you?
- You owe me 40.

39
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:09,942
- Twenty, 40.
- My reward?

40
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:17,522
And what do you suggest?

41
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,616
Your mother wishes to see you,
Lady Georgiana.

42
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:33,836
Thank you.

43
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,958
I must apologize, Mama.
Were we making too much noise?

44
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,617
Not at all, my darling.

45
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:58,026
We have more important things
to talk of. Come here.

46
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:09,608
- I have heard a rumor.
- Yes?

47
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,807
That I will soon be addressing
my daughter

48
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:16,006
as Her Grace,
the Duchess of Devonshire.

49
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,211
- Is it true, Mama?
- It is.

50
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,555
The Duke of Devonshire?

51
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:32,291
I had hoped not to part with you
until 18 at the soonest,

52
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:33,422
but, with such a fine match,

53
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,127
it would be selfish of me
not to let you go.

54
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,135
- He loves me?
- Yes, of course.

55
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,000
I have only met him twice.

56
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,539
When one truly loves someone,

57
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,041
one doesn't have to know them well
to be sure, Georgiana.

58
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,145
One feels it right away.

59
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:53,585
- I do believe you will be happy with him.
- I shall, Mama. I know I shall.

60
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:32,974
- Come on!
- She's here!

61
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,178
Your Grace! Your Grace!

62
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:44,991
- There she is!
- Duchess!

63
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,565
What do they want?

64
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,465
To see me and my new wife, of course.

65
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,699
It can be a nuisance,
but you'll get used to it.

66
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,560
Welcome, Your Grace.

67
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:13,084
Come, boys. Come on.
Hugo, Hugo. Come.

68
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:16,450
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

69
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:21,122
It's all right. Yes, yes. This way.

70
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,986
Hugo. Come, boy. Come.

71
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:05,868
Scissors. You may go.

72
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,803
For the life of me,
I could never understand

73
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:44,103
why women's clothes
must be so damn complicated.

74
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:49,645
It's just our way
of expressing ourselves, I suppose.

75
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,983
Whatever do you mean?

76
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:59,649
Well, you have so many ways
of expressing yourselves,

77
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,991
whereas we must make do
with our hats and our dresses.

78
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,399
Would you go to the bed?

79
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,760
One has to accept one's responsibility.

80
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,528
Certain obligations come with marriage,

81
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,569
no matter how burdensome
they may seem.

82
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,434
Yes, but when we are together...

83
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:59,942
But when we are together, intimately,
I mean...

84
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,377
I know. It can be a bother.

85
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:05,245
However, it is only
until you have given him a son.

86
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:09,947
Then the occasions will become fewer
and less determined.

87
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,647
I think it might feel different

88
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:14,624
if he would talk to me
every once in a while.

89
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:18,686
I mean, it's not that he's unkind,
but he never talks to me.

90
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,060
I thought that he would be like Papa,

91
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,293
that under his cool reserve

92
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,995
there'd be a wealth of depth
and sentiment,

93
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:30,633
but he isn't interested in anything,
apart from his dogs.

94
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,574
Try not to be too hard on His Grace, G.

95
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:35,738
He's merely intent on fulfilling his duty.

96
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:40,217
And as for talking to him,
well, whatever is there to talk about?

97
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,947
No, you're quite right.

98
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:45,285
How foolish of me to think
that I should be able to converse

99
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,382
with my husband.

100
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,486
Georgiana, equip yourself with patience,
fortitude and resignation.

101
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:54,760
A boy will come soon enough,
and then you'll see.

102
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:09,172
But we, the Whig Party, simply see this
as just, right and sensible.

103
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:15,753
Just to bring independence to America.
Right to abolish the slave trade.

104
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:20,520
And sensible to bring freedom
to the common man,

105
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:25,586
so the blessings of this blessed plot,
this England,

106
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:30,635
may be more equally enjoyed
by all of its inhabitants.

107
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:40,873
I would like to propose a toast
to our host and benefactor

108
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,974
His Grace the Duke
and his beautiful new Duchess.

109
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,882
Please be upstanding.

110
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:58,027
- The Duke and Duchess!
- The Duke and Duchess!

111
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:09,535
Excellent speech, Mr. Fox.

112
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,839
I thank you. It is always easier
to address a congregation of friends,

113
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:16,847
particularly when those friends
are drunk.

114
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:20,851
And how did the Duchess find
Mr. Fox's speech?

115
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:24,286
I must confess, I am not yet at ease
with political speeches.

116
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,518
Their very form tends to obstruct
my view of their actual meaning,

117
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,719
if such there be.

118
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:31,762
In which particular section
of the speech

119
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,594
did the message elude Your Grace?

120
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,465
Well, I have great sympathy
with your sentiments in general,

121
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:44,372
but I fail to fully comprehend
how far we, the Whig Party, that is,

122
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:47,240
are fully committed
to the concept of freedom.

123
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:50,314
- We intend to extend the vote.
- To all men?

124
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:54,876
Heavens, no. But certainly to more men.
Freedom in moderation.

125
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,512
- "Freedom in moderation"?
- Precisely.

126
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,618
I'm sure you are
full of the best intentions, Mr. Fox,

127
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,093
but I dare say
I would not spend my vote,

128
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:08,895
if I had it, of course,
on so vague a statement.

129
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:13,301
One is either free or one is not.
The concept of freedom is an absolute.

130
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,566
After all,
one cannot be moderately dead

131
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:19,974
or moderately loved or moderately free.

132
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,980
It must always remain
a matter of either or.

133
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,648
I think it appropriate to say a few words.

134
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:30,949
When...

135
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,271
Could you check the chamber

136
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,576
- and see if you can find...
- Your Grace.

137
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,174
...different kinds of French lace?

138
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:06,046
- Is anything the matter?
- No.

139
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,261
- You just left.
- Yes. Well, I had done eating,

140
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,991
and those damn speeches
bore me to distraction.

141
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,260
I think we have to ban them
in the future.

142
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:20,327
But you are the Whigs' main supporter.

143
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,999
Yes. Well,
I've no problem with the politics.

144
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,702
It's just the rhetoric I can't stand.

145
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:33,674
- Shall I come with you?
- No. I mean, why ever should you?

146
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,807
The Duke is perfectly well.
He simply wanted to rest a while.

147
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,813
Do sit down, gentlemen.

148
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:13,823
Was it the length of the speech
that got the better of the Duke?

149
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,690
Certainly not.

150
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:17,819
He enjoyed it immensely

151
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,661
and expressed a hope
that next time it would be even longer.

152
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,994
- Your Grace.
- Mr. Fox.

153
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:57,726
- What's going on?
- Nothing to concern you.

154
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:02,437
- I don't understand.
- Come here.

155
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:15,314
You look very beautiful tonight.
Is this dress your design?

156
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,822
Yes, it is. Thank you.

157
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:31,165
Then I think you should allow
your husband to appreciate it

158
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,238
in a little more detail.

159
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,771
Come here.

160
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:11,598
- Yes, send them in.
- Are we having company?

161
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,870
Don't you think
this mutton has a funny taste?

162
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:21,144
- No. Not really, no.
- I think it does.

163
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:36,690
G, this is Charlotte,
and she will be staying with us.

164
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:41,730
Why?

165
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:57,718
Because her mother is dead,
and she has no other place to go.

166
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,022
Have you fathered that child?

167
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:10,133
It's... It's only a little girl, G.
It's hardly the end of the world.

168
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:16,732
- Are you expecting me to look after her?
- We have a house full of vacant rooms.

169
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,504
She needn't bother you.
In fact, she may even be of use to you.

170
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,307
You can practice your mothering skills,

171
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:27,177
until our son arrives.

172
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,246
No, this doesn't taste
like normal mutton.

173
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:36,691
I'm sure there is something the matter
with it. Could you take it away?

174
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:42,464
Does it taste like normal mutton?

175
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:47,227
Does it taste like normal mutton?
Come here.

176
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:52,201
Think it tastes like normal mutton,
fussy dog?

177
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,302
Who's a fussy mutton dog?

178
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:09,284
Does your doll have a name?

179
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,101
I bet you
she loves being in her new bedroom.

180
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:24,174
You'll have to think of a name
and let me know tomorrow.

181
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:27,473
Do you think
you'll be able to do that, Charlotte?

182
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:30,745
I...

183
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,784
- Would you leave us, please?
- Your Grace.

184
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:48,058
Hello, Charlotte.

185
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:55,969
My name is Georgiana.

186
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:22,155
- Good evening.
- Thank you.

187
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,434
Good evening, ladies.

188
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:34,102
An inch more and I do believe
Your Grace will explode.

189
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:37,443
Sheridan always knows
how to pay a compliment.

190
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,107
Still a few more weeks to wait.

191
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:42,209
A huge belly has never been
more becoming on anyone.

192
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,347
Well, Fox, here, offers an expert opinion
seeing, as he does, a giant belly

193
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,585
every time he passes a mirror.

194
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:51,355
If your belly were on a woman, well,
we'd all know what to think.

195
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:55,160
My dear Sheridan,
an hour ago my belly was on a woman.

196
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,030
Now what do you think?

197
00:23:57,135 --> 00:24:01,265
That will teach you to insult Mr. Fox
before the gaming has begun.

198
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,168
It's very good.

199
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,083
No more bets, please.

200
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:23,954
Seven.

201
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,594
Her Grace wins again.

202
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:31,558
Another wager?

203
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:36,272
- Are you all right, Your Grace?
- Your Grace!

204
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,406
Are those labor pains?
My wife is in labor.

205
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:47,084
Come along.

206
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:49,517
I think this calls for a toast.

207
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:52,454
I may have an heir
before the night is out.

208
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,360
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the sixth Duke of Devonshire.

209
00:24:57,462 --> 00:25:00,522
The sixth Duke of Devonshire!

210
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:30,058
- Your Grace.
- I am in no mood for a conversation.

211
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:32,391
But, pray tell me, is my daughter...

212
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:36,194
Is your daughter at all able
to give me a son?

213
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:37,825
Take heart, Your Grace.

214
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:39,597
As long as the mother is in good health,

215
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,695
consider this mishap a draft,

216
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:44,240
a promise of what is soon to come.

217
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:47,472
- In our family, we...
- Yes, I know, in your family,

218
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,206
in your family.

219
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:53,782
Your Grace.

220
00:25:56,955 --> 00:26:00,391
Can you see the light? Can you see it?

221
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,996
- Darling, how are you?
- Quite well.

222
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:16,673
- Is she strong and healthy?
- She's perfect.

223
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:25,647
- Did William receive you?
- Yes.

224
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:29,685
Is he upset that she's not a son?

225
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:35,590
He just glanced at her and then left.
I've hardly seen him since.

226
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,685
It's been a difficult time for His Grace,
my dear.

227
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:41,254
Many eyes are upon him
and not all of them kind.

228
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,433
She is the loveliest.

229
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,574
- Nurse?
- No, I will feed her.

230
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:54,008
- Are you sure, darling?
- Yes.

231
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:02,315
I am her mother, after all,
even if she is only a girl.

232
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:06,123
There.

233
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,555
Hell and damnation!

234
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:53,231
It is always a pleasure

235
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:57,240
when one is on holiday
to request a few words of wisdom.

236
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,934
And so without further ado,

237
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:03,743
it is a great honor to hand over
to our most distinguished guest.

238
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,874
When she arrives,
all eyes are upon her.

239
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:11,012
When absent, she is the subject
of universal conversation.

240
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:13,113
And what we see her wearing tonight,

241
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:17,183
I look forward to seeing
the rest of you wearing tomorrow!

242
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:22,392
The empress of fashion herself,
the Duchess of Devonshire.

243
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,338
We come away to Bath
to get away from London,

244
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,641
and all of London
has come away to Bath.

245
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:40,113
Somebody did indeed ask me

246
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,709
what kind of feather it is
that I'm wearing.

247
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:46,848
Well, there are only two specimens
of this rare bird known to man.

248
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:51,224
One of them has clearly ended up
on top of my head.

249
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:55,595
And the other, rumor has it,
is running for office in the Tory Party.

250
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:21,590
Bess Foster.

251
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:33,968
Excuse me.

252
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:15,308
- I don't believe we've been introduced.
- No, we haven't. Lady Elizabeth Foster.

253
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:19,941
- I saw you talking with my husband.
- Yes. He wanted to dance.

254
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:26,146
That's not usually considered his forte.
And you declined?

255
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:30,555
I'm ill at ease with male company
for the moment.

256
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:35,129
Thank you.

257
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,227
So what brings you to Bath?

258
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:45,069
My husband, Mr. Foster,
is enjoying his mistress in Bournemouth

259
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:48,145
and I wanted some diversion. And you?

260
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:54,315
The Duke is taking the waters
for his gout.

261
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,815
- And I for my health.
- Really?

262
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:02,157
I heard you were here
because you could not conceive a son.

263
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:06,594
I beg your pardon,
that was an awful thing to say.

264
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,393
It was the truth, at least.

265
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:11,127
Trust me to say something silly.
I always do, you know.

266
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:14,171
Then perhaps you should
have accepted the Duke's offer.

267
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,240
You have much in common.

268
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,847
Home, I think, Georgiana.

269
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:43,124
- Where are you staying?
- I've rented some rooms in town.

270
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:46,769
- We must meet again.
- We must.

271
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:07,624
Harryo. Come here. Come here.
Did that hurt?

272
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:10,216
- Mama.
- My angel.

273
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:15,495
Are you sore? Was that sore?
Let me have a look. Was it this knee?

274
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,698
I think you shall live.

275
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:23,297
Right. First to the bridge on my count.
One, two, three. Go.

276
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:24,636
Come on, Harryo.

277
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:27,905
- No, I'm gonna catch her!
- I'm gonna catch you!

278
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:32,210
Up and down. Up and down.
Why can't we recover like that?

279
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:34,285
It's too far to fall now.

280
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:37,877
- Hello again.
- Hello. Your girls are lovely.

281
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:42,983
- Thank you. Do you have any children?
- I do. Three boys.

282
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:45,725
Three boys.

283
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,731
What the Duke wouldn't give
for one of them.

284
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:57,273
- She is least like you, your eldest.
- Yes. I'm sure you know the story.

285
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,846
My husband's daughter was born
before we married.

286
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:08,908
Her mother was a maid.
The maid died, and we took the child.

287
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,887
- I'm sorry. Have I spoken out of turn?
- No.

288
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,687
It's the worst-kept secret in London.
She's nine years old now.

289
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:17,522
And you love her?

290
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:20,529
Of course I do.
The same as all my children.

291
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,332
Come and meet them.

292
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:30,168
Girls. Come and meet my new friend,
Lady Elizabeth.

293
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:40,543
- Your Grace.
- Thank you. Thermal water.

294
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:44,487
It's the sulfur
that makes it smell so bad.

295
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:48,423
- And you really have to drink it?
- Twice a day for four weeks.

296
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,922
Do you have any reason to believe
you cannot birth a male?

297
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,559
No. Except miscarriages.

298
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,931
Two stillbirths, both sons.

299
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,841
But two healthy girls.

300
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,182
Everybody is staring at you.

301
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:28,662
What's that on your neck? Bess?

302
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:34,035
It's not illegal for a man
to beat his wife with a stick

303
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:37,130
unless the stick is thicker
than his thumb.

304
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:41,200
Mr. Foster? But he can't have done that!

305
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:43,906
Well, considering what else
he's done to me, that's not the worst.

306
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,448
What could possibly be worse?

307
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,713
He's taken my children.
He won't let me see them.

308
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:59,427
- And what do you propose to do?
- Really, I'm at my wits' end.

309
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,960
The law supports Mr. Foster.

310
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,596
In the meantime, where shall you stay?

311
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:12,505
Continue lodging,
till the money runs out.

312
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:19,414
Well, there, at least, I think I can help.

313
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:29,089
William? We leave tomorrow.

314
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:36,194
And Lady Elizabeth doesn't have
to meet her parents on the continent

315
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,495
for some time.

316
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:43,472
- She hardly ever visits London at all.
- It's a pity, that.

317
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:49,177
You see,
she doesn't have anywhere to stay.

318
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:53,673
Problem there.

319
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,848
Well, why doesn't she stay with us?
For a while, at least.

320
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:04,525
Thank you.

321
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:12,934
- This is incredible.
- There's the castle in Ireland.

322
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:18,339
Bolton Abbey, Chiswick, Burlington
and, why, in Chatsworth, of course.

323
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:21,434
- Of course.
- Which is much bigger.

324
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,639
But this is more like home.

325
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:31,011
I'm so glad you're here.

326
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,818
I've arranged a wonderful start
to the season.

327
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:42,031
May all the plagues of marriage
be doubled on me

328
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:47,332
if ever I try to be friends
with you anymore!

329
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:49,167
So much the better.

330
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:56,502
No, no, madam.
'Tis evident you care not a pin for me!

331
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:01,314
And I, I was a madman to marry you.

332
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:05,753
And I'm sure I was a fool to marry you,

333
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:09,223
an old dangling bachelor

334
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:14,326
who was single at 50

335
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:18,493
only because he never could meet
with anyone who could have him!

336
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:44,092
Bess, may I introduce Mr. Fox,
leader of the Opposition?

337
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:47,596
- Mr. Fox, Lady Elizabeth Foster.
- Mr. Fox.

338
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:51,794
- My protégé, Charles Grey.
- Mr. Grey.

339
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:53,529
- Mr. Grey.
- Your Grace.

340
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:56,072
He's our newest bright young man.

341
00:37:56,173 --> 00:38:00,007
Scarcely out of Cambridge
and already a member of Parliament.

342
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:04,145
- I always felt you'd do well.
- Thank you.

343
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:06,478
- Mr. Fox.
- Yes, Lady Elizabeth.

344
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:13,481
- Did you enjoy the play?
- I must confess, I did not entirely.

345
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,291
I hope that you've not lost
your sense of humor

346
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,955
- since entering politics.
- Not that I'm aware.

347
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,656
Then I'm sure you realize
that <i>School for Scandal</i>

348
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,792
- was written as a comedy.
- Yes.

349
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:28,895
Although, from where I sat,
it read as a tragedy.

350
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:32,942
Your Grace! How we have missed you.

351
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,033
In your absence,

352
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,875
London has been reduced
to the dreariest province.

353
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,711
And this, of course,
is the playwright Mr. Sheridan.

354
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,115
May I present
the Lady Elizabeth Foster?

355
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:43,345
I do not mean to be rude,

356
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:45,615
but I've an entire cast
dying to meet the Duchess.

357
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:48,453
I shall return you in a moment. Promise.

358
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:52,229
- Mr. Fox?
- Yes.

359
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,354
A word.

360
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:58,094
Well, wherever do I glean
such domestic gossip?

361
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:01,296
- Were we fair on the Duke?
- It could have been worse.

362
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:04,101
My original title was <i>The Bad Marriage.</i>

363
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,377
Is it always like this?

364
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:12,278
Well, as they say,

365
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:14,613
the Duke of Devonshire
must be the only man in England

366
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,619
not in love with his wife.

367
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:20,787
- Her Grace, the Duchess of Devonshire.
- Very pleased to meet you.

368
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:32,693
Were you at all able to forget things
and enjoy yourself?

369
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:36,739
It was a wonderful distraction,
thank you.

370
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:37,933
Good.

371
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:44,946
- I talked to Mr. Grey all evening.
- Yes?

372
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:48,474
He's in love with you.

373
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:53,649
My dear Bess, no, he is not.
Quite the reverse, I fear.

374
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:57,455
Well, can't you tell
by the way he looks at you?

375
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,496
- Honestly, can't you tell?
- Stop it.

376
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,460
Georgiana,
intercourse is not just about offspring.

377
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:14,372
- In fact, it can be rather pleasurable.
- Yes, I know.

378
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:22,117
Close your eyes
and try to envisage Grey

379
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:26,349
opening your dress, kissing your back.

380
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:29,449
- They never do such things.
- Yes, they do.

381
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,693
Close your eyes.

382
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:48,940
Grey is behind you
slowly opening your dress.

383
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:51,446
- No, Bess, stop!
- Close your eyes.

384
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:09,659
Kissing your back.

385
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:33,816
There.

386
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:36,389
See?

387
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:11,188
- Would you excuse me for a minute?
- You must excuse me, gentlemen.

388
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,729
- Your Grace.
- Mr. Grey.

389
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:16,459
The national election
is in six weeks, yes?

390
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,592
How is the campaign going?

391
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:22,700
Terribly.

392
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:27,333
Our only hope
is to save Westminster for Fox.

393
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:29,674
I have many faults, as you well know.

394
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:33,409
Not least among them
is my ability to draw attention.

395
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,385
Perhaps we could use that
to our advantage.

396
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,267
Ladies and gentlemen.

397
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:59,966
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the man

398
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,773
who will inform us
of the work we must do

399
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,510
and of the party we so believe in.
Mr. Charles Grey.

400
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:18,826
Good people of Westminster!

401
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:24,231
The world is on the brink of disaster
or salvation!

402
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:25,996
From France to America,

403
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:29,095
men and women are struggling
to free themselves,

404
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:32,607
to find meaning in their existence!

405
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,201
Change is upon us!

406
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:40,377
We shall not go back to the old ways.

407
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:45,649
We shall take England
into this brave new world

408
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:48,554
and shake the thunder from the skies!

409
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:06,338
- How did I do?
- I think it was not an embarrassment.

410
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:10,075
It was a marvel.

411
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:14,173
I was nervous. Your presence
trebled the numbers at least.

412
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:19,985
I'm nervous even now.

413
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:26,028
If we win this election,
if we get the power,

414
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,098
think what we will do.

415
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:30,996
Do you think of me
when we're not together?

416
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:35,694
You ought to know I do.

417
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:38,434
- You hesitated before you replied.
- No.

418
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:50,880
I'm unused to being asked so directly.

419
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:56,316
And by you, of all people.

420
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:03,867
I think of you all the time. I always have.

421
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,533
- Your carriage awaits, Your Grace.
- Thank you.

422
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,811
...this we vow!

423
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:48,372
What are you doing outside
Lady Elizabeth's room?

424
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,719
Who's in there with her?

425
00:47:01,983 --> 00:47:07,979
Of all the women in England
you had to throw yourself on her.

426
00:47:12,193 --> 00:47:17,722
I have never once objected
to any of your affairs.

427
00:47:20,034 --> 00:47:24,095
I have accepted whatever arrangement
you have proposed.

428
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:29,403
I have raised Charlotte
as my own daughter.

429
00:47:32,447 --> 00:47:33,812
But this...

430
00:47:36,918 --> 00:47:41,048
I have one single thing of my own.

431
00:47:44,292 --> 00:47:47,489
Why couldn't you let me keep Elizabeth
for myself?

432
00:47:49,897 --> 00:47:52,525
What kind of man are you?

433
00:47:55,670 --> 00:48:01,370
She is my sole comfort in our marriage.
You have robbed me of my only friend!

434
00:48:10,852 --> 00:48:12,717
What is wrong with me?

435
00:48:38,112 --> 00:48:39,170
I...

436
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:47,586
I've never claimed
to be a man of fine sensibility, G.

437
00:48:47,688 --> 00:48:50,953
But I've always known
what I expect from this marriage

438
00:48:51,058 --> 00:48:53,288
and what I'm prepared to give.

439
00:48:54,562 --> 00:48:58,555
As a husband,
I have fulfilled my obligations.

440
00:48:58,666 --> 00:49:01,931
But, as a wife,

441
00:49:04,305 --> 00:49:06,432
you have not.

442
00:49:06,541 --> 00:49:09,942
She has to go. Now.

443
00:49:10,044 --> 00:49:12,638
She is never to set foot
in this house again!

444
00:49:12,747 --> 00:49:14,681
Do mind your temper, G.
You're forgetting yourself.

445
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:17,674
I want her out.

446
00:49:19,921 --> 00:49:24,654
I never want to lay eyes on her again.
Go down and tell her to leave at once.

447
00:49:29,263 --> 00:49:31,197
I couldn't ask her that.

448
00:49:33,868 --> 00:49:35,495
I won't do it, G.

449
00:49:52,787 --> 00:49:57,986
- I never liked her from the first.
- You made that quite clear, Mama.

450
00:49:58,092 --> 00:50:00,822
She's gone from Devonshire House,
I hope.

451
00:50:04,899 --> 00:50:06,890
They're living there together?

452
00:50:07,001 --> 00:50:09,333
Georgiana!
What have you permitted to happen?

453
00:50:09,437 --> 00:50:13,066
I don't know. I don't know.

454
00:50:13,174 --> 00:50:16,871
Help me. Help me, please, Mama.
Tell me what to do.

455
00:50:21,382 --> 00:50:25,478
You must write to your husband
and insist he send her back

456
00:50:25,586 --> 00:50:27,747
to whatever horrid little place
she came from.

457
00:50:27,855 --> 00:50:32,622
He will not.
"It is out of the question," he says.

458
00:50:38,366 --> 00:50:42,200
Then you must return
and resume your duties.

459
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,828
Make him realize whom he loves.

460
00:50:44,939 --> 00:50:47,703
You will give up your politics
and your gambling.

461
00:50:47,808 --> 00:50:51,107
For once,
you will devote yourself as a loving wife

462
00:50:51,212 --> 00:50:55,171
and settle down to the task in hand,
providing him with an heir.

463
00:50:56,584 --> 00:50:58,814
Then he will soon tire of her.

464
00:51:07,628 --> 00:51:09,619
You have no other option.

465
00:51:48,569 --> 00:51:49,866
Hello, G.

466
00:51:52,139 --> 00:51:53,367
William.

467
00:52:26,807 --> 00:52:30,800
I may not have the authority
to remove you from my house,

468
00:52:30,911 --> 00:52:33,539
but I can, at least,
order you out of my room.

469
00:52:33,647 --> 00:52:36,013
Won't you please let me explain?

470
00:52:37,618 --> 00:52:38,676
There is nothing to explain.

471
00:52:38,786 --> 00:52:42,278
This is my only chance
of ever seeing my children again.

472
00:52:43,557 --> 00:52:45,752
The Duke is the most powerful peer
in England.

473
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:47,088
He is my only chance.

474
00:52:47,194 --> 00:52:51,130
There are limits to the sacrifices
one makes for one's children.

475
00:52:51,232 --> 00:52:55,328
No, there aren't. No limits whatsoever.

476
00:52:58,472 --> 00:52:59,700
Get out.

477
00:53:03,644 --> 00:53:06,613
We have nothing more
to say to one another.

478
00:53:59,533 --> 00:54:00,864
Mama, Mama!

479
00:54:08,275 --> 00:54:10,835
It's so nice to see you, Mama.

480
00:54:10,945 --> 00:54:13,505
Right, this is a shotgun.

481
00:54:13,614 --> 00:54:15,548
Your mother said
you'd be interested, yes?

482
00:54:15,649 --> 00:54:16,673
Yes.

483
00:54:18,285 --> 00:54:19,980
This is a flint. Do you see?

484
00:54:20,087 --> 00:54:23,113
When the flint hits there,
it causes a spark to happen.

485
00:54:23,224 --> 00:54:29,094
Now, the spark, it lights the gunpowder
and sends the bullet out of the gun.

486
00:54:29,196 --> 00:54:31,323
- Do you know how to hold it?
- No, sir.

487
00:54:31,432 --> 00:54:36,836
Well, it's like that.
Tuck it in there, into your right shoulder.

488
00:54:36,971 --> 00:54:40,600
Hold it firmly, then you can move
that hand a little further along.

489
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:44,735
Can you feel how heavy it is?
You have to lean into it a bit.

490
00:54:44,845 --> 00:54:48,804
And keep both eyes open.
Look right along the barrel.

491
00:54:48,916 --> 00:54:51,282
Right along there just like that.

492
00:54:53,254 --> 00:54:57,156
Bang! Here, let me show you.

493
00:55:00,861 --> 00:55:02,192
There.

494
00:55:03,097 --> 00:55:05,224
It's quite heavy, isn't it?

495
00:55:06,567 --> 00:55:10,560
Are you thirsty?
Would you like something to drink?

496
00:55:10,671 --> 00:55:14,198
Are you gentlemen thirsty?
Would you like something to drink?

497
00:55:16,443 --> 00:55:17,774
Thank you.

498
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,726
Did you tell the Duke
who you were meeting?

499
00:56:13,834 --> 00:56:14,858
No.

500
00:56:15,736 --> 00:56:17,670
- Did he even ask?
- No.

501
00:56:18,806 --> 00:56:20,967
He has other things on his mind.

502
00:56:22,676 --> 00:56:24,075
As do you.

503
00:56:28,515 --> 00:56:30,983
Would it help to unburden yourself?

504
00:56:33,754 --> 00:56:36,245
It's nothing I can discuss with you.

505
00:56:38,158 --> 00:56:40,251
Besides, it would only bore.

506
00:56:41,195 --> 00:56:44,130
You don't have to please others
all the time.

507
00:56:44,231 --> 00:56:48,258
It's what I've been brought up to do.
Difficult lesson to unlearn.

508
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:54,307
Would you permit me an observation?

509
00:56:58,612 --> 00:57:01,740
I believe you do it
so that people will love you.

510
00:57:02,583 --> 00:57:05,643
- What makes you say that?
- From what I've seen.

511
00:57:07,388 --> 00:57:12,416
With your husband, your friends,
especially Lady Bess,

512
00:57:14,662 --> 00:57:16,254
even the public.

513
00:57:18,399 --> 00:57:20,993
I never thought of it that way before.

514
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:25,165
You make me sound so pitiable.

515
00:57:31,045 --> 00:57:32,342
Georgiana.

516
00:57:34,581 --> 00:57:38,347
I've gone beyond my brief. I apologize.

517
00:57:40,254 --> 00:57:43,655
Please believe
it was only for your sake that I spoke.

518
00:57:44,958 --> 00:57:47,153
Please, tell me what is wrong.

519
00:57:51,765 --> 00:57:55,599
I fear I've done
some things in life too late

520
00:57:55,703 --> 00:57:57,534
and others too early.

521
00:58:02,176 --> 00:58:03,768
No, you haven't.

522
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,691
I'm sorry.

523
00:58:58,699 --> 00:59:00,030
Thank you.

524
00:59:16,717 --> 00:59:18,048
All right.

525
00:59:21,388 --> 00:59:22,753
"All right"?

526
00:59:26,293 --> 00:59:28,193
Do you love each other?

527
00:59:30,931 --> 00:59:35,061
- Georgiana...
- Do you love Bess, Your Grace?

528
00:59:36,737 --> 00:59:40,229
- Where is all this leading?
- I make no demands on him.

529
00:59:42,576 --> 00:59:46,637
- And, Bess, do you love my husband?
- As I do you.

530
00:59:49,716 --> 00:59:51,741
And so you intend to stay?

531
00:59:54,788 --> 00:59:56,881
William has asked that I do.

532
00:59:58,292 --> 01:00:01,455
You couldn't find it in your heart
to refuse him?

533
01:00:03,697 --> 01:00:04,789
No.

534
01:00:09,136 --> 01:00:11,062
Then let us make a deal.

535
01:00:12,005 --> 01:00:14,633
- A deal?
- Yes.

536
01:00:17,478 --> 01:00:20,675
I give you my blessing

537
01:00:20,781 --> 01:00:24,649
if you will accept my feelings
for Charles Grey.

538
01:00:27,187 --> 01:00:28,779
I didn't realize it at first.

539
01:00:28,889 --> 01:00:32,416
I thought that perhaps
it was only a dalliance.

540
01:00:33,894 --> 01:00:35,691
It can make me happy.

541
01:00:40,601 --> 01:00:43,399
A deal? A deal.

542
01:00:44,972 --> 01:00:46,735
I don't make deals.

543
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:49,308
Why would I?

544
01:00:51,845 --> 01:00:53,039
I'm in charge of it all.

545
01:00:53,146 --> 01:00:57,708
You know, I would call him out.
I would challenge him.

546
01:00:57,818 --> 01:00:59,445
- I'd put a bullet in his head.
- William.

547
01:00:59,553 --> 01:01:03,649
Be quiet. Are you determined
to make me a total laughingstock?

548
01:01:03,757 --> 01:01:06,487
A man who cannot sire a son,
and then a cuckold?

549
01:01:06,593 --> 01:01:08,754
William. Georgiana only asks
what we ourselves...

550
01:01:08,862 --> 01:01:10,454
Be quiet, woman!

551
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:15,159
- Are you his whore?
- No.

552
01:01:16,436 --> 01:01:18,597
But I can't see why you'd mind.

553
01:01:18,705 --> 01:01:22,106
- You have Bess and three boys!
- Three boys?

554
01:01:24,311 --> 01:01:27,405
Do you think
I can make those bastards my heirs?

555
01:01:29,249 --> 01:01:31,080
Well? Do you?

556
01:01:41,261 --> 01:01:42,523
William!

557
01:02:14,795 --> 01:02:16,786
You don't know me in the least, do you?

558
01:02:16,897 --> 01:02:18,694
Yes, I do. We're a bad match.

559
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:22,997
I asked but two things when we wed,
loyalty and a male heir.

560
01:02:23,103 --> 01:02:25,469
The same as your dogs!

561
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:33,603
No, don't touch me! Don't touch me!

562
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:37,947
Get off!

563
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:45,587
Get off me!

564
01:02:45,692 --> 01:02:50,026
Is this how you treat her?
Is this how you treat your whore?

565
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:52,155
No! No!

566
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:56,359
No! No! No!

567
01:02:57,237 --> 01:02:58,499
No!

568
01:03:02,676 --> 01:03:05,270
Come with me.
Charlotte, come with me.

569
01:03:06,446 --> 01:03:08,073
No! No!

570
01:03:30,671 --> 01:03:36,906
Give me a son.
Until then, stay here and do as I say.

571
01:03:53,393 --> 01:03:59,332
I give you the winner.
Mr. Fox, the man of the people!

572
01:04:06,206 --> 01:04:12,042
And I give you the weapon,
the Duchess of Devonshire.

573
01:04:24,091 --> 01:04:25,683
Thank you.

574
01:04:25,792 --> 01:04:30,320
Thank you, all of you,
for this reception today.

575
01:04:32,332 --> 01:04:38,703
Today we have won the vote.
Tomorrow we define the future!

576
01:04:50,984 --> 01:04:52,952
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

577
01:04:56,490 --> 01:04:58,685
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

578
01:05:02,062 --> 01:05:03,359
Your Grace.

579
01:05:09,469 --> 01:05:10,959
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

580
01:05:31,591 --> 01:05:34,492
Will Your Grace give me
the favor of a dance?

581
01:05:58,285 --> 01:05:59,616
Steady, G.

582
01:06:04,424 --> 01:06:06,949
- Fire!
- Georgiana!

583
01:06:08,028 --> 01:06:09,086
Your Grace!

584
01:06:09,563 --> 01:06:11,053
Her Grace's hair!

585
01:06:14,034 --> 01:06:15,365
Do something!

586
01:06:27,147 --> 01:06:29,513
Please put out Her Grace's hair.

587
01:07:05,285 --> 01:07:07,310
Her Grace needs to rest.

588
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:09,479
As long as she follows
strict instructions

589
01:07:09,589 --> 01:07:12,558
there should be no impediment
to the birth.

590
01:07:12,659 --> 01:07:14,718
What are you talking about?

591
01:07:15,695 --> 01:07:17,754
The Duchess is pregnant.

592
01:07:49,062 --> 01:07:50,393
And there.

593
01:07:53,767 --> 01:07:55,394
Thank you, Heaton.

594
01:07:59,306 --> 01:08:00,500
Come.

595
01:08:12,686 --> 01:08:14,051
Your Grace.

596
01:08:15,689 --> 01:08:20,217
As per the terms of
His Grace's inheritance, this is for you

597
01:08:21,294 --> 01:08:23,091
to spend as you wish.

598
01:08:27,767 --> 01:08:29,394
Success at last.

599
01:08:38,111 --> 01:08:39,408
Georgiana.

600
01:08:41,715 --> 01:08:44,741
I, too, abhor this whole thing.

601
01:09:04,204 --> 01:09:05,728
Twist or stick?

602
01:09:07,173 --> 01:09:09,471
- Stick.
- Stick?

603
01:09:10,443 --> 01:09:12,274
I'll stick, too, then.

604
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:15,545
Let's see.

605
01:09:16,416 --> 01:09:18,145
You won. Well done.

606
01:09:19,219 --> 01:09:20,447
Come on.

607
01:09:23,123 --> 01:09:24,317
Come on.

608
01:09:26,359 --> 01:09:27,417
Come on.

609
01:09:33,266 --> 01:09:35,291
Mama, you forgot to deal.

610
01:09:54,821 --> 01:09:57,312
- Your Grace.
- Mr. Grey.

611
01:09:59,359 --> 01:10:02,419
- You are recalled from France?
- For a while.

612
01:10:02,529 --> 01:10:04,156
No revolution yet?

613
01:10:05,632 --> 01:10:08,499
No, not yet,
but it's only a matter of time.

614
01:10:11,171 --> 01:10:15,267
- How is it you are here?
- I received an invitation.

615
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:21,240
I assumed it was on behalf of the Party.
I could not say no.

616
01:10:21,381 --> 01:10:22,712
Of course.

617
01:10:30,056 --> 01:10:31,523
I bore a son.

618
01:10:34,327 --> 01:10:35,453
Yes.

619
01:10:37,764 --> 01:10:41,325
His name is
William George Spencer Cavendish,

620
01:10:41,434 --> 01:10:46,133
Marquis of Hartington.
We call him Hart.

621
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:48,503
You and the Duke must be very pleased.

622
01:10:48,608 --> 01:10:49,870
We are.

623
01:10:53,847 --> 01:10:56,611
The Duke has gone to London
to celebrate.

624
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:04,418
You have been missed.

625
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,793
Much missed.

626
01:11:16,035 --> 01:11:18,162
- Ten on the Queen.
- Four on five.

627
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:20,239
And no more bets, please.

628
01:11:23,243 --> 01:11:26,337
The losing card, four.

629
01:11:29,415 --> 01:11:32,111
The winning card, Queen.

630
01:11:58,444 --> 01:12:00,844
Jolly good. Eight on the three.

631
01:12:00,947 --> 01:12:02,710
Put five on the five.

632
01:12:04,784 --> 01:12:07,014
All of the fives have gone, G.

633
01:12:10,323 --> 01:12:12,518
I think I'm too tired to play.

634
01:12:15,595 --> 01:12:17,859
- Gentlemen.
- Your Grace.

635
01:12:29,809 --> 01:12:31,140
Georgiana.

636
01:12:33,046 --> 01:12:34,707
No one must know.

637
01:12:36,115 --> 01:12:38,913
- You summoned Grey.
- Good night.

638
01:14:39,939 --> 01:14:42,407
I was thinking about going to Bath.

639
01:14:46,512 --> 01:14:53,008
Bess, you can stay here and look after
our husband whilst I take the cure.

640
01:14:54,821 --> 01:14:57,187
Yes, William. Why not?

641
01:14:57,290 --> 01:15:00,885
If G goes now, we can catch up with her
when you're free.

642
01:15:02,095 --> 01:15:03,790
Well, if you must.

643
01:15:16,876 --> 01:15:21,006
"The Duchess of Devonshire appeared
last week in Bath in a mobcap.

644
01:15:22,048 --> 01:15:25,279
"Her Grace, ever since initiation
into the business of electioneering,

645
01:15:25,385 --> 01:15:27,250
"has been much attached to the mobs."

646
01:15:27,353 --> 01:15:28,980
Very good.

647
01:15:32,692 --> 01:15:34,922
So which one is your favorite?

648
01:15:38,131 --> 01:15:40,326
- This one.
- Yeah.

649
01:15:42,568 --> 01:15:45,799
In this one it seems
you've hit a winning streak, for once.

650
01:15:45,905 --> 01:15:47,270
Very good.

651
01:15:50,076 --> 01:15:52,601
And in this one you see...

652
01:15:52,712 --> 01:15:56,512
Is that dress really an appropriate way
to attract voters?

653
01:15:56,616 --> 01:16:00,052
You politicians know absolutely nothing
about fashion.

654
01:16:01,554 --> 01:16:04,990
But if you were to really ask me
which my favorite was,

655
01:16:06,793 --> 01:16:08,761
I'd say it was this one.

656
01:16:23,376 --> 01:16:25,469
- Morning, Charles.
- Morning.

657
01:16:25,578 --> 01:16:27,011
Good day to you, sir.

658
01:16:52,672 --> 01:16:55,334
It's perfect. Thank you.

659
01:17:20,867 --> 01:17:23,233
Thought we would surprise you, G.

660
01:17:23,369 --> 01:17:26,202
I think you once said there wasn't
enough spontaneity in our marriage

661
01:17:26,305 --> 01:17:28,273
or words to that effect.

662
01:17:31,811 --> 01:17:34,041
Mama, what are you doing here?

663
01:17:35,681 --> 01:17:40,050
So, have you seen
many of our circle in Bath?

664
01:17:41,821 --> 01:17:42,947
Some.

665
01:17:44,257 --> 01:17:49,593
The Cokes and Haverford
and Lord Wicklow.

666
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:53,222
Bunch of politicos, too, aren't there?
Meetings and such.

667
01:17:54,233 --> 01:17:55,222
I believe.

668
01:17:55,334 --> 01:17:59,771
Is Grey here?
By which I mean Mr. Charles Grey.

669
01:18:00,706 --> 01:18:02,833
Rumor has it that he is.

670
01:18:02,942 --> 01:18:04,671
- I won't give him up.
- Georgiana.

671
01:18:04,777 --> 01:18:07,940
Everyone has a lover.
Bess is the lover of my husband.

672
01:18:08,047 --> 01:18:09,708
If you had shown some discretion,

673
01:18:09,815 --> 01:18:12,215
- it might have been different.
- Different?

674
01:18:12,318 --> 01:18:14,752
The only good fortune is
it hasn't yet made it to the papers.

675
01:18:14,854 --> 01:18:18,688
My dear, Grey is unmarried.
He has no wealth, no rank.

676
01:18:18,791 --> 01:18:22,227
He risks nothing with this affair.
The hazard is all yours.

677
01:18:22,328 --> 01:18:25,161
- Grey loves me.
- So does William.

678
01:18:25,264 --> 01:18:28,665
Yes. I love you.

679
01:18:30,303 --> 01:18:31,531
How?

680
01:18:33,339 --> 01:18:35,933
In the way I understand love.

681
01:18:38,978 --> 01:18:43,677
Georgiana, this has gone much too far.
It is beneath our dignity.

682
01:18:43,783 --> 01:18:46,149
- All London is talking.
- Let them talk.

683
01:18:46,252 --> 01:18:48,777
If Grey makes me a fallen woman,
well and good.

684
01:18:48,888 --> 01:18:51,379
Now William may divorce me and
Bess becomes Duchess of Devonshire.

685
01:18:51,490 --> 01:18:53,355
That will never happen.

686
01:18:55,561 --> 01:18:57,893
I think I will leave you to it.

687
01:19:03,436 --> 01:19:05,631
What follows now?

688
01:19:05,738 --> 01:19:09,003
Are you going to tear my clothes off
and force yourself upon me again?

689
01:19:09,108 --> 01:19:11,303
Why on earth would I do that?

690
01:19:12,211 --> 01:19:17,478
I know that you've never thought much
of my manners or my intellect, G.

691
01:19:18,551 --> 01:19:22,715
But, in fact, I never do anything
that serves no purpose.

692
01:19:22,822 --> 01:19:25,689
I know precisely
what you two have together.

693
01:19:25,791 --> 01:19:27,622
- We love each other.
- I do not doubt it.

694
01:19:27,727 --> 01:19:29,422
He is a dreamer like yourself,

695
01:19:29,528 --> 01:19:34,124
and you both dream of another world
that does not exist and it never will.

696
01:19:34,233 --> 01:19:37,862
As for reality, allow me to enlighten you.

697
01:19:39,071 --> 01:19:42,871
If you do not give him up at once,
I will see to it

698
01:19:42,975 --> 01:19:47,435
that every home and every checkbook
in this country is closed to him.

699
01:19:47,546 --> 01:19:50,379
He will be welcomed
neither in the halls of government

700
01:19:50,483 --> 01:19:53,077
nor in its backrooms of power.

701
01:19:53,185 --> 01:19:55,983
His dream of becoming prime minister

702
01:19:56,122 --> 01:20:02,459
and your mutual fantasy
of a changed world will be dead as ash.

703
01:20:06,432 --> 01:20:09,299
And you will never
see your children again.

704
01:20:18,811 --> 01:20:20,142
Georgiana.

705
01:21:05,524 --> 01:21:07,856
I must ask you to return to London.

706
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:09,928
- Without you?
- Yes.

707
01:21:18,437 --> 01:21:20,837
These are from our girls.

708
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:25,206
Little Hart neglected to write,
but then, of course, he's not yet one.

709
01:21:36,722 --> 01:21:40,681
- This will be the mistake of your life.
- No.

710
01:21:43,195 --> 01:21:45,322
I made that many years ago.

711
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,766
I trust you can see yourself out.

712
01:22:11,157 --> 01:22:13,990
- Damn you, man, open the door!
- Your Grace.

713
01:24:12,378 --> 01:24:15,370
Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama!

714
01:24:19,952 --> 01:24:21,715
Mama, Mama, Mama.

715
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:43,572
- Come on, girls.
- Mama. I love you.

716
01:24:43,676 --> 01:24:47,476
Girls, run along.
Your mother will join you in a minute.

717
01:24:47,579 --> 01:24:48,807
Come on.

718
01:24:51,951 --> 01:24:53,282
Run along.

719
01:24:57,723 --> 01:24:58,747
G.

720
01:25:13,038 --> 01:25:14,801
You must know
how greatly pleased I am

721
01:25:14,907 --> 01:25:17,933
that we have come to an arrangement.

722
01:25:18,043 --> 01:25:22,139
It's not good for little ones
to be without their mother for so long.

723
01:25:22,247 --> 01:25:25,910
- My life for theirs.
- That's one way of putting it.

724
01:25:28,587 --> 01:25:32,614
Your mother called it "common decency
before personal gratification,"

725
01:25:32,725 --> 01:25:35,558
or some such thing.
The exact words escape me.

726
01:25:35,661 --> 01:25:39,358
How about
"imprisoned in my own house"?

727
01:25:42,067 --> 01:25:44,729
No. That's not how she put it.

728
01:25:46,672 --> 01:25:48,867
I would have remembered that.

729
01:26:13,432 --> 01:26:15,059
Georgiana!

730
01:26:15,167 --> 01:26:18,000
Unhand me!

731
01:26:18,103 --> 01:26:19,400
Georgiana!

732
01:26:23,175 --> 01:26:27,043
Georgiana! Will you please unhand me?

733
01:26:27,146 --> 01:26:28,477
Excuse me.

734
01:26:35,654 --> 01:26:38,214
Georgiana! Please.

735
01:26:39,925 --> 01:26:41,256
Georgiana!

736
01:26:42,828 --> 01:26:45,296
- Thank you, Burleigh.
- Let him go.

737
01:26:47,132 --> 01:26:52,832
I have written a dozen times a day.
Still, there is nothing from you.

738
01:26:52,938 --> 01:26:56,465
What has happened?
Do you love me no longer?

739
01:26:57,943 --> 01:27:02,380
- My personal feelings remain unaltered.
- Then we must be together again.

740
01:27:02,481 --> 01:27:05,075
I want to marry you.
I want you to bear my children.

741
01:27:05,184 --> 01:27:06,879
And I don't care if they're boys or girls!

742
01:27:06,985 --> 01:27:10,386
- I wish it could be that way.
- It can. It will.

743
01:27:11,623 --> 01:27:13,648
Sorrows will come
however we try to avoid them.

744
01:27:13,759 --> 01:27:15,989
We must stay the course
and never give in.

745
01:27:16,095 --> 01:27:18,859
- No, Charles.
- You must leave and be with me.

746
01:27:18,964 --> 01:27:21,125
A free woman. Now! Let us leave now!

747
01:27:21,233 --> 01:27:23,963
I cannot abandon my children.

748
01:27:27,239 --> 01:27:29,935
Listen to what you are asking me to do.

749
01:28:23,095 --> 01:28:26,587
What's the matter?
Don't like the pigeon?

750
01:28:28,967 --> 01:28:30,832
I find it quite decent.

751
01:28:38,510 --> 01:28:41,172
I'm carrying Charles Grey's child.

752
01:28:54,493 --> 01:28:58,088
Please be so kind as to inform
the Duchess of my decision.

753
01:29:00,132 --> 01:29:02,362
This is how it will be.

754
01:29:02,467 --> 01:29:06,403
You will be taken to the country
where you will give birth to the child,

755
01:29:06,505 --> 01:29:10,601
and the child will be trusted
to the care of Charles Grey's family.

756
01:29:14,746 --> 01:29:16,407
Are you listening?

757
01:29:17,416 --> 01:29:19,407
I think she's heard you. Let's leave her.

758
01:29:19,518 --> 01:29:21,509
- Georgiana, please.
- I said let's leave.

759
01:29:21,653 --> 01:29:24,053
This is not a discussion.
She's been informed of my decision.

760
01:29:24,156 --> 01:29:26,124
- Have pity on her, William.
- Pity be damned.

761
01:29:26,225 --> 01:29:28,557
She's brought this upon herself,
as well you know.

762
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:31,652
- Now come.
- No. I will go with her.

763
01:29:32,764 --> 01:29:34,322
But you're not going anywhere.

764
01:29:34,433 --> 01:29:36,128
I will go with G, if G will have me,

765
01:29:36,235 --> 01:29:40,035
and there's nothing you can do or say
to stop either of us.

766
01:30:33,492 --> 01:30:37,087
- Thank you for coming.
- I couldn't not be with you.

767
01:31:14,666 --> 01:31:16,031
It's time.

768
01:31:20,339 --> 01:31:22,967
- Would it help...
- No, I must take her.

769
01:32:46,391 --> 01:32:49,690
Your Grace, I'm General Grey.

770
01:32:52,564 --> 01:32:54,122
Where's Charles?

771
01:32:55,033 --> 01:32:58,298
Your husband thought it best
if I took care of this.

772
01:33:36,074 --> 01:33:37,564
General Grey.

773
01:33:40,278 --> 01:33:41,939
Her name is Eliza.

774
01:33:53,959 --> 01:33:55,256
Come on.

775
01:34:06,705 --> 01:34:11,642
Come on, G. I've got you. I've got you.

776
01:35:37,329 --> 01:35:40,890
I'm not particularly adept
at expressing myself

777
01:35:40,999 --> 01:35:44,765
when it comes to matters
of a more personal nature.

778
01:35:47,606 --> 01:35:49,198
But I shall try.

779
01:35:52,210 --> 01:35:55,077
Over the years, I have acted in ways

780
01:35:55,180 --> 01:35:59,446
that you have judged to be harsh.

781
01:36:03,521 --> 01:36:06,957
Well, I do not wish for you
to undergo any further suffering.

782
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:15,092
In fact, I would like our lives
to find a calm normality.

783
01:36:24,909 --> 01:36:27,070
Lady Melbourne has arranged
a small gathering

784
01:36:27,178 --> 01:36:30,511
in honor of your recent return
from holiday.

785
01:36:30,649 --> 01:36:34,210
And given some of the vague reports
that have been circulating this past year

786
01:36:34,352 --> 01:36:36,980
I think it would be wise for us to go.

787
01:36:38,890 --> 01:36:41,120
A show of unity, so to speak.

788
01:36:44,963 --> 01:36:46,590
Who will be there?

789
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:50,231
Everybody.

790
01:37:01,379 --> 01:37:02,744
As you wish.

791
01:37:48,326 --> 01:37:50,556
How wonderful to be that free.

792
01:38:07,245 --> 01:38:08,610
Come here.

793
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:20,286
Come here. Little G, come here.

794
01:38:34,739 --> 01:38:38,732
The Duke and Duchess of Devonshire
and Lady Elizabeth Foster.

795
01:38:51,923 --> 01:38:53,254
- Your Grace.
- It's lovely to see you.

796
01:38:53,358 --> 01:38:55,349
Welcome back, Your Grace.

797
01:38:58,763 --> 01:39:00,094
Excuse me.

798
01:39:00,932 --> 01:39:04,197
- Welcome back.
- Welcome home, Your Grace.

799
01:39:04,302 --> 01:39:07,203
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back, G.

800
01:39:07,305 --> 01:39:09,865
Your presence has been sorely missed.

801
01:39:49,848 --> 01:39:51,577
Would you excuse me?

802
01:39:55,119 --> 01:39:57,587
- Mr. Grey.
- Your Grace.

803
01:40:00,992 --> 01:40:03,290
I trust your tour was enjoyable.

804
01:40:04,863 --> 01:40:06,387
Yes.

805
01:40:06,497 --> 01:40:10,365
We spent the summer in Switzerland
and the winter in Nice.

806
01:40:10,468 --> 01:40:12,561
Well, I speak on behalf of everybody

807
01:40:12,670 --> 01:40:16,572
when I say how glad I am
that you have arrived home safely.

808
01:40:20,945 --> 01:40:23,140
And what news with you?

809
01:40:25,450 --> 01:40:27,111
I'm to be engaged.

810
01:40:30,054 --> 01:40:31,715
To Lady Ponsonby.

811
01:40:33,625 --> 01:40:36,185
The announcement will follow shortly.

812
01:40:37,829 --> 01:40:39,524
Congratulations.

813
01:40:42,901 --> 01:40:46,632
And I have a niece, Eliza,

814
01:40:50,008 --> 01:40:51,908
who is very much loved.

815
01:41:00,318 --> 01:41:02,809
One day you should come
and meet her,

816
01:41:04,055 --> 01:41:05,716
in a little while.

817
01:41:07,859 --> 01:41:09,520
If you would like.

818
01:41:12,497 --> 01:41:14,624
I would like that very much.

819
01:42:38,983 --> 01:42:40,917
Who's going to catch me first?

820
01:42:44,422 --> 01:42:45,946
- Me!
- Quick, girls.

821
01:42:46,057 --> 01:42:49,026
Quick, I'm going to get away!

822
01:42:49,127 --> 01:42:54,190
Come on, girls, keep running.

823
01:43:04,108 --> 01:43:06,906
And I love you, and I love you.

824
01:47:06,907 --> 01:47:07,909
