根據真實故事改編

托馬斯勳爵

沃爾特勳爵
Lord Walter.

7
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:21,800
你最好別令我失望 查爾斯·格雷
You'd better not let me down, Charles Grey.

8
00:01:21,902 --> 00:01:23,567
我在你身上投了20幾尼的賭注呢
I've got 20 guineas riding on you.

9
00:01:23,748 --> 00:01:27,612
才20?如果我是你 就會下雙倍
Only 20? I'd double that if I were you.

10
00:01:30,845 --> 00:01:32,437
來吧 女士們
Come on, ladies.

11
00:01:33,701 --> 00:01:35,939
奧爾索普莊園 1774年四月
Althorp Estate England, April 1774

12
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:41,662
先生 繞著跑道跑兩圈 聽我發令
Gentlemen, twice around the course, on my count.

13
00:01:44,158 --> 00:01:45,853
三 二
Three, two,

14
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:49,391
一!
one!

15
00:01:49,497 --> 00:01:51,021
快點 格雷先生!      快點 托馬斯!
Come on, Mr. Grey!        Come on, Thomas!

16
00:01:51,132 --> 00:01:54,101
快點 格雷先生!      跑起來 沃爾特勳爵
Come on, Mr. Grey!        Run, Lord Walter!

17
00:01:54,635 --> 00:01:56,466
快點 格雷先生!
Come on, Mr. Grey!

18
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,232
快點 格雷先生!你不會是累了吧
Come on, Mr. Grey. You're tired already.

19
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,900
快點 格雷先生!      快點!
Come on, Mr. Grey!        Faster!

20
00:02:16,056 --> 00:02:19,514
公爵您一定覺得喬治亞娜很有魅力吧?
I trust Your Grace still finds Georgiana an attractive girl?

21
00:02:19,627 --> 00:02:21,618
當然 斯賓塞夫人
Of course, Lady Spencer.

22
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:23,469
她是有教養的淑女
She's an accomplished lady of quality

23
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:25,375
恪盡職守
and devoted to her duties.

24
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:28,294
能說流利的法語 意大利語 拉丁語
She's fluent in French, Italian, Latin

25
00:02:28,402 --> 00:02:31,200
精通騎術和舞蹈 還有...
and fully versed in horsemanship and dancing and...

26
00:02:31,305 --> 00:02:35,605
是的 我看得出來 她是你的驕傲
Yes, I'm aware of all that. She's a credit to you.

27
00:02:37,044 --> 00:02:38,841
我想不出任何理由阻礙
I can't think of anything that would stand in the way

28
00:02:38,946 --> 00:02:41,107
締結如此美滿快樂的婚姻
of a singularly happy marriage.

29
00:02:41,215 --> 00:02:44,514
這些事情並不是公爵所擔心的 斯賓塞夫人
These are not the issues that burden the Duke, Lady Spencer.

30
00:02:44,618 --> 00:02:47,815
公爵所考慮的是繼承人的問題
It is His Grace's duty to produce an heir.

31
00:02:47,922 --> 00:02:49,287
換而言之 當那一天到來的時候
On the other hand, your daughter may expect

32
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,858
你的女兒必定有可觀的回報
a handsome reward when that occurs.

33
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,258
謝謝 希頓      不用客氣
Thank you, Heaton.        Your Grace.

34
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,295
公爵您大可以放心
Your Grace may rest assured.

35
00:02:58,399 --> 00:02:59,507
我們家族的女人
The women in our family

36
00:02:59,507 --> 00:03:01,385
從未沒喪失過那方面的能力
have never forfeited on that account.

37
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,764
既然有此保證...
Well, with that assurance...

38
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:16,573
那就這樣吧
So be it, then.

39
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:20,616
快點 格雷先生!
Come on, Mr. Grey!

40
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:32,861
抱歉 女士們 但看來我的馬贏了
I do apologize, ladies, but it appears that my horse has won.

41
00:03:34,468 --> 00:03:36,197
又擊敗我了 查爾斯
Beat me again, Charles.

42
00:03:38,272 --> 00:03:42,003
做得很好 格雷先生      表現不錯
Well done, Mr. Grey.        Well done.

43
00:03:42,176 --> 00:03:44,701
現在我們欠你多少呢?      你欠我40
So how much do we owe you?        You owe me 40.

44
00:03:44,812 --> 00:03:49,991
20 40      我的報酬呢?
Twenty, 40.        My reward?

45
00:03:54,054 --> 00:03:56,522
你想要什麼?
And what do you suggest?

46
00:03:56,624 --> 00:03:59,616
您母親想見你 喬治亞娜小姐
Your mother wishes to see you, Lady Georgiana.

47
00:04:11,505 --> 00:04:12,836
謝謝
Thank you.

48
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,958
非常抱歉 母親 我們是不是太吵鬧了?
I must apologize, Mama. Were we making too much noise?

49
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:33,617
不是 親愛的
Not at all, my darling.

50
00:04:33,727 --> 00:04:37,275
我們有更重要的事要談 過來
We have more important things to talk of. Come here.

51
00:04:45,172 --> 00:04:48,608
我聽到有傳聞      什麼?
I have heard a rumor.        Yes?

52
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,807
聽說再過不久 我的女兒
That I will soon be addressing my daughter

53
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:55,006
就能成為德文郡的公爵夫人
as Her Grace, the Duchess of Devonshire.

54
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,211
是真的嗎 母親?      是的
Is it true, Mama?        It is.

55
00:05:01,655 --> 00:05:03,555
德文郡的公爵夫人?
The Duke of Devonshire?

56
00:05:08,128 --> 00:05:11,291
我本想至少把你留到18歲
I had hoped not to part with you until 18 at the soonest,

57
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:12,422
但有此良緣
but, with such a fine match,

58
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:15,127
不放你走就顯得我太自私了
it would be selfish of me not to let you go.

59
00:05:15,235 --> 00:05:17,135
他愛我?      是的 當然
He loves me?        Yes, of course.

60
00:05:17,237 --> 00:05:19,000
我只見過他兩次
I have only met him twice.

61
00:05:19,106 --> 00:05:20,539
當真心愛著一個人的時候
When one truly loves someone,

62
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:23,041
並不需要相交很深就能確定 喬治亞娜
one doesn't have to know them well to be sure, Georgiana.

63
00:05:23,177 --> 00:05:25,145
馬上就能感受到
One feels it right away.

64
00:05:27,648 --> 00:05:29,286
我相信你和他一起會很快樂
I do believe you will be happy with him.

65
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:32,897
我會的 母親 我知道我會的
I shall, Mama. I know I shall.

66
00:07:01,882 --> 00:07:07,813
公爵夫人

67
00:07:10,484 --> 00:07:11,974
快點!      她來了!
Come on!        She's here!

68
00:07:12,085 --> 00:07:14,178
公爵夫人!公爵夫人!
Your Grace! Your Grace!

69
00:07:22,262 --> 00:07:23,991
她來了!      公爵夫人!
There she is!        Duchess!

70
00:07:24,097 --> 00:07:26,565
他們想要什麼?
What do they want?

71
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:30,129
當然是想見見我和我的新婚妻子
To see me and my new wife, of course.

72
00:07:31,605 --> 00:07:34,699
是有點煩人 但你會習慣的
It can be a nuisance, but you'll get used to it.

73
00:08:09,428 --> 00:08:15,232
倫敦 德文郡莊園
Devonshire House,London

74
00:08:30,797 --> 00:08:32,560
歡迎您 公爵夫人
Welcome, Your Grace.

75
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:52,084
來 小傢伙 雨果 雨果 來
Come, boys. Come on. Hugo, Hugo. Come.

76
00:08:52,185 --> 00:08:55,450
對 就這樣 
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

77
00:08:56,857 --> 00:09:00,122
好了 乖 乖 這邊走
It's all right. Yes, yes. This way.

78
00:09:01,995 --> 00:09:03,986
雨果 來 小傢伙 過來
Hugo. Come, boy. Come.

79
00:09:40,534 --> 00:09:44,868
剪刀 你們可以退下了
Scissors. You may go.

80
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,803
我無論如何也想不明白
For the life of me, I could never understand

81
00:10:19,906 --> 00:10:23,103
為什麼女人的衣服要做得這麼複雜
why women's clothes must be so damn complicated.

82
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:28,645
我想這只是我們表現自己的方式而已
It's just our way of expressing ourselves, I suppose.

83
00:10:32,219 --> 00:10:34,983
你的意思是什麼?
Whatever do you mean?

84
00:10:35,088 --> 00:10:38,649
噯 你有這麼多方式表現自己
Well, you have so many ways of expressing yourselves,

85
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:42,991
然而 我們只能擺弄我們的帽子和裙子
whereas we must make do with our hats and our dresses.

86
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:19,399
你上床來好嗎?
Would you go to the bed?

87
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:39,960
人必須承擔自己的責任
One has to accept one's responsibility.

88
00:12:40,067 --> 00:12:41,728
伴隨結婚而來的義務
Certain obligations come with marriage,

89
00:12:41,835 --> 00:12:43,769
不管它們有多艱難
no matter how burdensome they may seem.

90
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,634
是的 但我們在一起的時候...
Yes, but when we are together...

91
00:12:48,342 --> 00:12:52,142
我是說 當我們私下在一起的時候...
But when we are together, intimately, I mean...

92
00:12:52,245 --> 00:12:54,577
我知道 那的確很煩人
I know. It can be a bother.

93
00:12:54,681 --> 00:12:57,445
但是只要你能給他生個兒子
However, it is only until you have given him a son.

94
00:12:57,551 --> 00:13:02,147
那樣的情況會減少 也不會那麼堅決
Then the occasions will become fewer and less determined.

95
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:03,847
我覺得只要他能不時跟我談談
I think it might feel different

96
00:13:03,957 --> 00:13:06,824
感覺就會很不一樣
if he would talk to me every once in a while.

97
00:13:06,927 --> 00:13:10,886
他並非不和藹 但他從來不和我交談
I mean, it's not that he's unkind, but he never talks to me.

98
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,203
我以為他就像父親那樣
I thought that he would be like Papa,

99
00:13:12,203 --> 00:13:14,493
在冷酷的外表下
that under his cool reserve

100
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:17,195
有著深沉的情感 
there'd be a wealth of depth and sentiment,

101
00:13:17,304 --> 00:13:22,833
但除了他的狗 他對任何事情都不感興趣
but he isn't interested in anything, apart from his dogs.

102
00:13:22,943 --> 00:13:24,774
喬 試著別對他太苛求
Try not to be too hard on His Grace, G.

103
00:13:24,878 --> 00:13:27,938
他只不過在履行責任而已
He's merely intent on fulfilling his duty.

104
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:28,906
至於和他交談
And as for talking to him,

105
00:13:28,906 --> 00:13:30,861
有什麼可以談論的呢?
well, whatever is there to talk about?

106
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,147
是的 你說得對
No, you're quite right.

107
00:13:35,255 --> 00:13:37,118
居然覺得自己能和丈夫交談
How foolish of me to think that I should be able to

108
00:13:37,118 --> 00:13:38,628
我真是太愚蠢了
converse with my husband.

109
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:40,389
喬治亞娜
Georgiana,

110
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:43,606
用耐心 堅毅和順從裝備自己
equip yourself with patience, fortitude and resignation.

111
00:13:43,797 --> 00:13:46,960
兒子很快就會降生 到時你就會知道了
A boy will come soon enough, and then you'll see.

112
00:13:54,808 --> 00:13:56,717
但是我們 輝格黨
But we, the Whig Party,

113
00:13:56,717 --> 00:14:01,261
僅將這視作公平 正義及明智
simply see this as just, right and sensible.

114
00:14:01,261 --> 00:14:04,280
將獨立帶給美洲
Just to bring independence to America.

115
00:14:05,231 --> 00:14:08,510
爭取廢除奴隸買賣
Right to abolish the slave trade.

116
00:14:08,989 --> 00:14:12,720
將自由帶給平民
And sensible to bring freedom to the common man,

117
00:14:12,826 --> 00:14:17,786
這片受到賜福的土地 這個英國
so the blessings of this blessed plot, this England,

118
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:22,835
將會賜福居於此處的居民 令他們享有更多平等
may be more equally enjoyed by all of its inhabitants.

119
00:14:29,342 --> 00:14:33,073
我要向我們的主人及恩人
I would like to propose a toast to our host and benefactor

120
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:38,174
公爵及其美麗的公爵夫人敬酒
His Grace the Duke and his beautiful new Duchess.

121
00:14:38,285 --> 00:14:40,082
請起立
Please be upstanding.

122
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:50,227
敬公爵與公爵夫人!      敬公爵與公爵夫人！
The Duke and Duchess!        The Duke and Duchess!

123
00:15:00,006 --> 00:15:01,735
真是出色的演講啊 福克斯先生
Excellent speech, Mr. Fox.

124
00:15:01,842 --> 00:15:02,527
承蒙誇獎
I thank you.

125
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,201
向一群朋友演講總是比較容易的
It is always easier to address a congregation of friends,

126
00:15:05,201 --> 00:15:09,047
尤其當那些朋友喝醉的時候
particularly when those friends are drunk.

127
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:13,051
公爵夫人對福克斯先生的演講有何看法呢?
And how did the Duchess find Mr. Fox's speech?

128
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:16,486
我得承認 政治演講令我感到不太自在
I must confess, I am not yet at ease with political speeches.

129
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,043
他們的形式妨礙我
Their very form tends to

130
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:20,030
看出他們的真正含義
obstruct my view of their actual meaning,

131
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,919
如若真有含義的話
if such there be.

132
00:15:22,028 --> 00:15:24,034
演說的哪一部分
In which particular section of the speech

133
00:15:24,034 --> 00:15:26,973
令你難以理解呢 夫人?
did the message elude Your Grace?

134
00:15:28,468 --> 00:15:31,665
我同情你對大眾的感情
Well, I have great sympathy with your sentiments in general,

135
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:34,281
但我並不理解我們
but I fail to fully comprehend how far we,

136
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:36,084
也就是輝格黨
the Whig Party, that is,

137
00:15:36,676 --> 00:15:39,440
離堅定實現自由有多遠
are fully committed to the concept of freedom.

138
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:42,514
我們想要擴大投票範圍      面向所有人?
We intend to extend the vote.        To all men?

139
00:15:42,616 --> 00:15:43,661
天吶 當然不是
Heavens, no.

140
00:15:43,661 --> 00:15:46,456
但肯定是面向更多人 適度自由
But certainly to more men. Freedom in moderation.

141
00:15:47,187 --> 00:15:48,653
"適度自由"?
"Freedom in moderation"?

142
00:15:48,653 --> 00:15:49,836
正是
Precisely.

143
00:15:51,258 --> 00:15:53,818
我相信你是出於好心 福克斯先生
I'm sure you are full of the best intentions, Mr. Fox,

144
00:15:53,927 --> 00:15:56,293
但我敢肯定 假如我能投票的話
but I dare say I would not spend my vote,

145
00:15:56,396 --> 00:16:01,095
不會把自己的一票浪費在這麼含糊的陳述上
if I had it, of course, on so vague a statement.

146
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:03,369
一個宣稱自由 另一個不是
One is either free or one is not.

147
00:16:03,369 --> 00:16:05,484
而自由的概念是絕對的
The concept of freedom is an absolute.

148
00:16:05,605 --> 00:16:07,766
畢竟人不能適度死亡
After all, one cannot be moderately dead

149
00:16:07,874 --> 00:16:12,174
或適度被愛 又或適度自由
or moderately loved or moderately free.

150
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:15,180
必須二擇其一
It must always remain a matter of either or.

151
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:21,848
我想說幾句話
I think it appropriate to say a few words.

152
00:16:21,955 --> 00:16:23,149
當...
When...

153
00:16:47,447 --> 00:16:48,471
你能否看一下房間
Could you check the chamber

154
00:16:48,582 --> 00:16:49,776
看能不能找到      大人
and see if you can find...        Your Grace.

155
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,374
...別的法國緞帶?
...different kinds of French lace?

156
00:16:54,788 --> 00:16:58,246
有什麼事嗎？      沒有
Is anything the matter?        No.

157
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,461
你剛剛離席了      是的 我已經吃完了
You just left.        Yes. Well, I had done eating,

158
00:17:03,563 --> 00:17:06,191
而那些該死的演講令我煩心
and those damn speeches bore me to distraction.

159
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:08,460
我覺得以後應該禁止他們演講
I think we have to ban them in the future.

160
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:12,527
但你是輝格黨的主要支持者
But you are the Whigs' main supporter.

161
00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:15,199
是的 我並不反感政治
Yes. Well, I've no problem with the politics.

162
00:17:15,308 --> 00:17:17,902
我只是無法忍受誇誇其談
It's just the rhetoric I can't stand.

163
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,056
我應該和你一起去嗎?
Shall I come with you?

164
00:17:22,836 --> 00:17:26,875
不 為什麼要跟我一起去?
No. I mean, why ever should you?

165
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:53,007
公爵大人很好 只是想休息一會而已
The Duke is perfectly well. He simply wanted to rest a while.

166
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,013
請坐 先生們
Do sit down, gentlemen.

167
00:18:02,155 --> 00:18:06,023
是演講太長令公爵難以忍受嗎?
Was it the length of the speech that got the better of the Duke?

168
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,890
當然不是
Certainly not.

169
00:18:08,995 --> 00:18:10,019
他非常喜歡
He enjoyed it immensely

170
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,861
還希望下次能說得再長一點
and expressed a hope that next time it would be even longer.

171
00:18:15,702 --> 00:18:19,194
敬公爵夫人      敬福克斯先生
Your Grace.        Mr. Fox.

172
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,926
怎麼回事?      你無需過問
What's going on?        Nothing to concern you.

173
00:18:51,304 --> 00:18:55,138
我不明白      過來
I don't understand.        Come here.

174
00:19:03,817 --> 00:19:07,514
你今晚很美 這裙子是你設計的?
You look very beautiful tonight. Is this dress your design?

175
00:19:11,157 --> 00:19:13,022
是的 謝謝誇獎
Yes, it is. Thank you.

176
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:23,365
那麼你應當樂意讓你的丈夫
Then I think you should allow your husband to appreciate it

177
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,438
欣賞更多細節
in a little more detail.

178
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,971
過來
Come here.

179
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:03,798
好 叫他們進來      我們有客人嗎?
Yes, send them in.        Are we having company?

180
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:08,070
你不覺得這羊肉嘗起來不太一樣嗎?
Don't you think this mutton has a funny taste?

181
00:20:09,783 --> 00:20:13,344
不 不會      我覺得是
No. Not really, no.        I think it does.

182
00:20:22,462 --> 00:20:28,890
喬 這位是夏洛特 她將和我們住在一起
G, this is Charlotte, and she will be staying with us.

183
00:20:32,872 --> 00:20:33,930
為什麼?
Why?

184
00:20:45,618 --> 00:20:49,918
因為她母親去世了 她沒別的地方可去
Because her mother is dead, and she has no other place to go.

185
00:20:54,027 --> 00:20:56,222
那孩子是你的?
Have you fathered that child?

186
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:00,147
她...她不過是個小女孩 喬
It's... It's only a little girl, G.

187
00:21:00,688 --> 00:21:03,003
這不是世界末日
It's hardly the end of the world.

188
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,202
你想讓我來照顧她?
Are you expecting me to look after her?

189
00:21:06,202 --> 00:21:08,796
我們的房子有的是空房間
We have a house full of vacant rooms.

190
00:21:09,042 --> 00:21:09,951
她不會麻煩你
She needn't bother you.

191
00:21:09,951 --> 00:21:11,808
事實上 她會對你很有用處
In fact, she may even be of use to you.

192
00:21:11,808 --> 00:21:14,507
你可以練習為人母親的技巧
You can practice your mothering skills,

193
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:19,733
直到我們的兒子出生為止
until our son arrives.

194
00:21:22,922 --> 00:21:24,446
不 嘗起來不像正常的羊肉
No, this doesn't taste like normal mutton.

195
00:21:24,557 --> 00:21:25,848
我覺得裡面肯定加了點東西
I'm sure there is something the matter with it.

196
00:21:25,848 --> 00:21:26,725
拿走好嗎?
Could you take it away?

197
00:21:32,298 --> 00:21:34,664
嘗起來像正常羊肉嗎?
Does it taste like normal mutton?

198
00:21:35,969 --> 00:21:39,427
嘗起來像正常羊肉嗎?來
Does it taste like normal mutton? Come here.

199
00:21:41,307 --> 00:21:44,401
就當它是正常羊肉吧 挑食的小傢伙
Think it tastes like normal mutton, fussy dog?

200
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,502
挑食的小狗狗
Who's a fussy mutton dog?

201
00:21:59,425 --> 00:22:01,484
你的娃娃有名字嗎?
Does your doll have a name?

202
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:09,301
她一定很喜歡她的新睡房
l bet you she loves being in her new bedroom.

203
00:22:12,438 --> 00:22:16,374
你給她取個名字 明天告訴我好嗎
You'll have to think of a name and let me know tomorrow.

204
00:22:16,476 --> 00:22:19,673
能做到嗎?夏洛特
Do you think you'll be able to do that, Charlotte?

205
00:22:21,614 --> 00:22:22,945
我...
l...

206
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:25,984
請讓我們單獨呆一會 好嗎?      是 夫人
Would you leave us, please?        Your Grace.

207
00:22:38,631 --> 00:22:40,258
你好 夏洛特
Hello, Charlotte.

208
00:22:46,372 --> 00:22:48,169
我叫喬治亞娜
My name is Georgiana.

209
00:23:11,864 --> 00:23:14,355
晚上好      謝謝
Good evening.        Thank you.

210
00:23:17,837 --> 00:23:19,634
晚上好 夫人
Good evening, ladies.

211
00:23:23,242 --> 00:23:26,302
再大一英吋 夫人您就要分娩了
An inch more and I do believe Your Grace will explode.

212
00:23:26,412 --> 00:23:29,643
謝裡登一向深諳恭維之道
Sheridan always knows how to pay a compliment.

213
00:23:29,749 --> 00:23:31,307
還是得等上幾個星期
Still a few more weeks to wait.

214
00:23:31,417 --> 00:23:34,409
無論是誰 挺著個大肚子都不會好看
A huge belly has never been more becoming on anyone.

215
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,841
福克斯在說經驗之談呢
Well, Fox, here, offers an expert opinion seeing,

216
00:23:36,841 --> 00:23:40,423
每次經過鏡子旁邊 他都能看到自己的大肚子
as he does, a giant belly every time he passes a mirror.

217
00:23:40,893 --> 00:23:42,365
如果你的大肚子是長在女人身上
If your belly were on a woman, well,

218
00:23:42,365 --> 00:23:43,610
我們都知道是意味著什麼
we'd all know what to think.

219
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,605
親愛的謝裡登
My dear Sheridan,

220
00:23:44,605 --> 00:23:47,298
一個小時前 我的大肚子壓是在一個女人身上
an hour ago my belly was on a woman.

221
00:23:47,298 --> 00:23:49,230
現在你怎麼想?
Now what do you think?

222
00:23:49,335 --> 00:23:51,186
這教訓你在賭局開始前
That will teach you to insult Mr. Fox

223
00:23:51,186 --> 00:23:52,714
不要侮辱福克斯先生
before the gaming has begun.

224
00:23:57,844 --> 00:23:59,368
很好
It's very good.

225
00:24:06,452 --> 00:24:08,283
停止下注
No more bets, please.

226
00:24:17,997 --> 00:24:19,794
夫人又贏了
Her Grace wins again.

227
00:24:22,268 --> 00:24:23,758
再賭一把?
Another wager?

228
00:24:25,571 --> 00:24:28,472
你沒事吧 夫人?      夫人!
Are you all right, Your Grace?        Your Grace!

229
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,066
那是陣痛嗎?我的妻子要分娩了
Are those labor pains? My wife is in labor.

230
00:24:38,317 --> 00:24:39,284
快點
Come along.

231
00:24:39,385 --> 00:24:41,717
我想這值得敬酒
I think this calls for a toast.

232
00:24:41,821 --> 00:24:44,654
也許我的繼承人會在夜晚過去前降生
I may have an heir before the night is out.

233
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:49,560
女士們先生們 敬第六代德文郡公爵
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the sixth Duke of Devonshire.

234
00:24:49,662 --> 00:24:52,722
第六代德文郡公爵!
The sixth Duke of Devonshire!

235
00:25:18,491 --> 00:25:19,386
大人
Your Grace.

236
00:25:19,773 --> 00:25:22,261
我現在什麼都不想說
I am in no mood for a conversation.

237
00:25:22,361 --> 00:25:24,591
但是 請務必告訴我 我的女兒是否...
But, pray tell me, is my daughter...

238
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:28,394
你的女兒是否能為我誕下麟兒?
Is your daughter at all able to give me a son?

239
00:25:28,501 --> 00:25:30,025
放心吧 大人
Take heart, Your Grace.

240
00:25:30,136 --> 00:25:31,797
只要母親健康
As long as the mother is in good health,

241
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,895
把這次不幸當作是草稿
consider this mishap a draft,

242
00:25:34,006 --> 00:25:36,440
即將降臨的諾言
a promise of what is soon to come.

243
00:25:36,976 --> 00:25:39,672
在我們的家族 我們...      是的 我知道 在你的家族裡
In our family, we...        Yes, I know, in your family,

244
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:41,406
在你的家族裡
in your family.

245
00:25:44,617 --> 00:25:45,982
我先告退
Your Grace.

246
00:25:49,155 --> 00:25:52,825
你看到這光芒嗎?看到嗎?
Can you see the light? Can you see it?

247
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,196
親愛的 你怎麼樣了?      我很好
Darling, how are you?        Quite well.

248
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,873
她是否健康強壯?      她很完美
Is she strong and healthy?        She's perfect.

249
00:26:15,014 --> 00:26:17,847
威廉接待了你嗎?      是的
Did William receive you?        Yes.

250
00:26:19,485 --> 00:26:21,885
他是否因她不是兒子而不高興?
Is he upset that she's not a son?

251
00:26:24,423 --> 00:26:25,961
他看了她一眼就離開了
He just glanced at her and then left.

252
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:27,376
之後我就很少見到他了
I've hardly seen him since.

253
00:26:27,894 --> 00:26:29,885
這段時期對公爵大人來說不好過 親愛的
It's been a difficult time for His Grace, my dear.

254
00:26:29,996 --> 00:26:33,454
很多人在盯著他 而並非所有人都是友善的
Many eyes are upon him and not all of them kind.

255
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:38,633
她是個美女
She is the loveliest.

256
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,774
奶媽?      不 我親自哺育她
Nurse?        No, I will feed her.

257
00:26:43,876 --> 00:26:46,208
你說真的嗎 親愛的?     是的
Are you sure, darling?        Yes.

258
00:26:50,283 --> 00:26:54,515
畢竟我是她的母親 即使她是個女孩
I am her mother, after all, even if she is only a girl.

259
00:26:57,356 --> 00:26:58,323
過來
There.

260
00:27:00,026 --> 00:27:01,755
該死的!
Hell and damnation!

261
00:27:08,942 --> 00:27:12,745
6年後
Six years later

262
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:14,351

266
00:27:43,736 --> 00:27:46,974
外出度假以尋求智慧之言
It is always a pleasure when one is on holiday

267
00:27:46,974 --> 00:27:49,438
總是令人愉快的
to request a few words of wisdom.

268
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,134
不再贅言
And so without further ado,

269
00:27:51,244 --> 00:27:53,005
我榮幸地請出
it is a great honor to hand over to

270
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,007
我們最高貴的來賓
our most distinguished guest.

271
00:27:56,048 --> 00:27:59,074
當她出現 所有目光都凝注在她身上
When she arrives, all eyes are upon her.

272
00:27:59,185 --> 00:28:03,212
當她離開 她是人們談論的對象
When absent, she is the subject of universal conversation.

273
00:28:03,322 --> 00:28:05,313
她今晚所穿之物
And what we see her wearing tonight,

274
00:28:05,424 --> 00:28:09,383
我期望明天看到你們都穿上!
I look forward to seeing the rest of you wearing tomorrow!

275
00:28:09,495 --> 00:28:14,592
有請時尚女王 德文郡公爵夫人
The empress of fashion herself, the Duchess of Devonshire.

276
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,538
我們來巴斯是想擺脫倫敦
We come away to Bath to get away from London,

277
00:28:26,646 --> 00:28:29,443
沒想到整個倫敦都來了巴斯
and all of London has come away to Bath.

278
00:28:30,516 --> 00:28:32,313
的確有人問過我
Somebody did indeed ask me

279
00:28:32,418 --> 00:28:34,909
我戴的是什麼羽毛
what kind of feather it is that I'm wearing.

280
00:28:35,021 --> 00:28:36,908
這種稀有鳥類
Well, there are only two specimens

281
00:28:36,908 --> 00:28:39,031
世上只剩兩隻
of this rare bird known to man.

282
00:28:39,158 --> 00:28:43,424
其中一隻顯然在我頭上
One of them has clearly ended up on top of my head.

283
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:44,262
而另一隻
And the other,

284
00:28:44,262 --> 00:28:47,663
據傳言是放在保守黨的辦公室裡
rumor has it, is running for office in the Tory Party.

285
00:29:12,391 --> 00:29:13,790
貝絲·福斯特
Bess Foster.

286
00:29:24,837 --> 00:29:26,168
失陪
Excuse me.

287
00:30:01,774 --> 00:30:03,338
我們尚未互相介紹吧
I don't believe we've been introduced.

288
00:30:03,338 --> 00:30:06,956
是的 我是伊麗莎白·福斯特夫人
No, we haven't. Lady Elizabeth Foster.

289
00:30:07,613 --> 00:30:09,211
我看到你和我丈夫談話
I saw you talking with my husband.

290
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:12,478
是的 他想跳舞
Yes. He wanted to dance.

291
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:18,346
這通常不是他的長處 你婉謝了嗎?
That's not usually considered his forte. And you declined?

292
00:30:19,592 --> 00:30:22,755
目前我並不想要任何異性的陪伴
I'm ill at ease with male company for the moment.

293
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:27,329
謝謝
Thank you.

294
00:30:28,334 --> 00:30:30,427
那麼是什麼風把你吹來巴斯?
So what brings you to Bath?

295
00:30:33,572 --> 00:30:35,299
我的丈夫福斯特先生
My husband, Mr. Foster,

296
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:37,416
正和情婦在伯恩茅斯風流快活
is enjoying his mistress in Bournemouth

297
00:30:37,416 --> 00:30:40,345
我想找點消遣 你呢?
and I wanted some diversion. And you?

298
00:30:43,682 --> 00:30:46,515
公爵是來浸浴治療痛風
The Duke is taking the waters for his gout.

299
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,015
而我是為了自己的健康      真的?
And I for my health.        Really?

300
00:30:50,956 --> 00:30:54,357
我聽說你來這裡是因為生不出兒子
I heard you were here because you could not conceive a son.

301
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:58,794
請原諒 我不該說這樣的話
I beg your pardon, that was an awful thing to say.

302
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,593
至少說的是實話
It was the truth, at least.

303
00:31:00,699 --> 00:31:03,327
我說了愚蠢的話 我一直都這樣
Trust me to say something silly. I always do, you know.

304
00:31:03,436 --> 00:31:06,371
那麼也許你該接受公爵的邀請
Then perhaps you should have accepted the Duke's offer.

305
00:31:06,472 --> 00:31:08,440
你們有很多共同點
You have much in common.

306
00:31:20,419 --> 00:31:23,047
我想該回家了 喬治亞娜
Home, I think, Georgiana.

307
00:31:31,797 --> 00:31:35,324
你住在哪裡呢?      我在鎮上租了幾個房間
Where are you staying?        I've rented some rooms in town.

308
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:39,454
我們一定要再見面      一定會的
We must meet again.        We must.

309
00:31:55,888 --> 00:31:59,824
夏蘿 過來 過來 疼嗎?
Harryo. Come here. Come here. Did that hurt?

310
00:31:59,925 --> 00:32:02,416
媽媽      我的小天使
Mama.        My angel.

311
00:32:03,429 --> 00:32:05,265
你疼嗎?疼不疼?
Are you sore? Was that sore?

312
00:32:05,446 --> 00:32:08,696
讓我看看 是膝蓋嗎?
Let me have a look. Was it this knee?

313
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,898
你會沒事的
I think you shall live.

314
00:32:11,003 --> 00:32:15,497
好啦 衝到橋上去 我數三聲 一 二 三 跑
Right. First to the bridge on my count. One, two, three. Go.

315
00:32:15,608 --> 00:32:16,836
快點啊 夏蘿
Come on, Harryo.

316
00:32:16,942 --> 00:32:20,105
不 我會追上她的      我會追上你的!
No, I'm gonna catch her!        I'm gonna catch you!

317
00:32:20,212 --> 00:32:22,719
跌倒了再爬起來 
Up and down. Up and down. 

318
00:32:22,719 --> 00:32:24,295
為什麼我們不能像那樣重新開始呢?
Why can't we recover like that?

319
00:32:24,517 --> 00:32:26,485
我們已長大成人了
It's too far to fall now.

320
00:32:26,585 --> 00:32:30,077
又見面了 你好      你好 你的女兒很漂亮
Hello again.        Hello. Your girls are lovely.

321
00:32:30,189 --> 00:32:35,183
謝謝 你有孩子嗎?      我有 三個男孩
Thank you. Do you have any children?        I do. Three boys.

322
00:32:36,128 --> 00:32:37,925
三個男孩
Three boys.

323
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,931
哪怕能得到一個 公爵就已經願意捨棄一切了
What the Duke wouldn't give for one of them.

324
00:32:42,635 --> 00:32:44,733
年紀最大的那個長得最不像你
She is least like you, your eldest.

325
00:32:45,773 --> 00:32:50,474
是的 我想你都聽說了吧
Yes. I'm sure you know the story.

326
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,046
在我們結婚之前 我丈夫的女兒已經出生
My husband's daughter was born before we married.

327
00:32:57,149 --> 00:33:01,108
她的母親是個女僕 女僕死後我們接收了那個孩子
Her mother was a maid. The maid died, and we took the child.

328
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,087
抱歉 我是不是說得太多了?      不是
I'm sorry. Have I spoken out of turn?        No.

329
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,557
這在倫敦已是公開的秘密了
It's the worst kept secret in London.

330
00:33:05,557 --> 00:33:07,305
她現在已經九歲了
She's nine years old now.

331
00:33:07,993 --> 00:33:09,722
你愛她?
And you love her?

332
00:33:09,828 --> 00:33:13,125
當然 就像自己親生的一樣
Of course I do. The same as all my children.

333
00:33:16,268 --> 00:33:18,532
過來見見他們
Come and meet them.

334
00:33:18,637 --> 00:33:22,368
姑娘們 過來見見我的新朋友 伊麗莎白夫人
Girls. Come and meet my new friend, Lady Elizabeth.

335
00:33:29,114 --> 00:33:32,743
夫人      謝謝 溫泉水
Your Grace.        Thank you. Thermal water.

336
00:33:34,787 --> 00:33:36,687
那股味道是硫帶來的
It's the sulfur that makes it smell so bad.

337
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:38,030
你真的要喝這個嗎?
And you really have to drink it?

338
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,156
一天兩次 喝一個月
Twice a day for four weeks.

339
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:46,122
你知不知道自己為什麼生不出男孩呢?
Do you have any reason to believe you cannot birth a male?

340
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:49,759
不 除了流產
No. Except miscarriages.

341
00:33:52,004 --> 00:33:54,131
兩次產下死胎 都是男胎
Two stillbirths, both sons.

342
00:33:57,176 --> 00:33:59,041
但能生下兩個健康的女孩
But two healthy girls.

343
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,382
每個人都在盯著你
Everybody is staring at you.

344
00:34:16,562 --> 00:34:20,862
你脖子上的是什麼?貝絲
What's that on your neck? Bess?

345
00:34:23,402 --> 00:34:26,235
用棍毆打妻子並不犯法
It's not illegal for a man to beat his wife with a stick

346
00:34:26,338 --> 00:34:29,330
除非棍子比他的拇指還厚
unless the stick is thicker than his thumb.

347
00:34:29,441 --> 00:34:33,400
福斯特先生?但他不可能做這樣的事!
Mr. Foster? But he can't have done that!

348
00:34:33,512 --> 00:34:34,929
想想他對我做過的其他事
Well, considering what else he's done to me,

349
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:35,975
這已經不是最糟的
that's not the worst.

350
00:34:35,975 --> 00:34:37,648
還有什麼更糟的?
What could possibly be worse?

351
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,913
他奪走我的孩子 不讓我見他們
He's taken my children. He won't let me see them.

352
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,969
你打算怎麼辦呢?
And what do you propose to do?

353
00:34:49,807 --> 00:34:52,022
我真的無計可施了
Really, I'm at my wits' end.

354
00:34:54,033 --> 00:34:56,160
法律站在福斯特先生那邊
The law supports Mr. Foster.

355
00:34:58,804 --> 00:35:01,796
那這段時間你住在哪裡呢?
In the meantime, where shall you stay?

356
00:35:01,907 --> 00:35:04,705
繼續租住 直到錢用盡為止
Continue lodging, till the money runs out.

357
00:35:08,781 --> 00:35:11,614
至少這一點我能幫得上忙
Well, there, at least, I think I can help.

358
00:35:18,957 --> 00:35:21,289
威廉?我們明天就離開
William? We leave tomorrow.

359
00:35:24,196 --> 00:35:27,734
伊麗莎白夫人起碼有一段時間
And Lady Elizabeth doesn't have to meet her parents

360
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:29,421
不需要去內陸看父母
on the continent for some time.

361
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:33,405
她都沒怎麼參觀過倫敦呢
She hardly ever visits London at all.

362
00:35:33,405 --> 00:35:36,029
真遺憾啊
It's a pity, that.

363
00:35:38,544 --> 00:35:41,377
你瞧 她沒別的地方可以呆了
You see, she doesn't have anywhere to stay.

364
00:35:44,383 --> 00:35:45,873
那是個問題
Problem there.

365
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,218
那麼她為什麼不和我們住在一起呢?
Well, why doesn't she stay with us?

366
00:35:52,123 --> 00:35:53,483
至少呆上一段時間
For a while, at least.

367
00:35:55,394 --> 00:35:56,725
謝謝
Thank you.

368
00:36:02,301 --> 00:36:05,134
真不可思議啊      在愛爾蘭有城堡
This is incredible.        There's the castle in lreland.

369
00:36:05,237 --> 00:36:08,370
博爾頓修道院 齊斯克之屋 百靈頓大屋
Bolton Abbey, Chiswick, Burlington and,

370
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:10,706
當然還有察茲沃斯宮
why, in Chatsworth, of course.

371
00:36:10,706 --> 00:36:13,634
當然      那更大了
Of course.        Which is much bigger.

372
00:36:13,746 --> 00:36:15,839
但這裡更像一個家
But this is more like home.

373
00:36:20,686 --> 00:36:23,211
很高興你在這裡
I'm so glad you're here.

374
00:36:23,322 --> 00:36:26,018
我為這個季度安排了一個精彩的起點
I've arranged a wonderful start to the season.

375
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:34,231
如果我再和你做朋友
May all the plagues of marriage be doubled on me

376
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:39,532
就讓我加倍承受婚姻的折磨吧
if ever I try to be friends with you anymore!

377
00:36:39,638 --> 00:36:41,367
那就更好了
So much the better.

378
00:36:44,743 --> 00:36:48,702
不 不 夫人 顯然你一點也不在乎我!
No, no, madam. 'Tis evident you care not a pin for me!

379
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:53,514
娶你這樣的人 我真是發瘋了
And I, I was a madman to marry you.

380
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:57,953
嫁給你這樣的人 我真是蠢極了
And I'm sure I was a fool to marry you,

381
00:36:58,056 --> 00:37:01,423
搖搖欲跌的單身老漢
an old dangling bachelor

382
00:37:04,296 --> 00:37:06,526
單身到五十歲
who was single at 50

383
00:37:06,632 --> 00:37:11,094
只因從來沒有人看上他!
only because he never could meet with anyone who could have him!

384
00:37:32,424 --> 00:37:36,292
貝絲 請容許我介紹福克斯先生 反對派的領袖
Bess, may I introduce Mr. Fox, leader of the Opposition?

385
00:37:36,395 --> 00:37:39,796
福克斯先生 這位是伊麗莎白·福斯特夫人      福克斯先生
Mr. Fox, Lady Elizabeth Foster.        Mr. Fox.

386
00:37:39,898 --> 00:37:43,994
我的門生 查爾斯·格雷      格雷先生
My protege, Charles Grey.        Mr. Grey.

387
00:37:44,102 --> 00:37:45,729
格雷先生      夫人
Mr. Grey.        Your Grace.

388
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:48,272
他是我們的新進英才
He's our newest bright young man.

389
00:37:48,373 --> 00:37:52,207
剛從劍橋畢業不久 就已經位列議會
Scarcely out of Cambridge and already a member of Parliament.

390
00:37:53,512 --> 00:37:56,345
我一直覺得你很出色      謝謝
I always felt you'd do well.        Thank you.

391
00:37:56,448 --> 00:37:58,678
福克斯先生      伊麗莎白夫人
Mr. Fox.        Yes, Lady Elizabeth.

392
00:37:59,685 --> 00:38:00,936
你喜歡這個戲劇嗎?
Did you enjoy the play?

393
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:06,138
我得老實承認 並不太喜歡
I must confess, I did not entirely.

394
00:38:07,626 --> 00:38:09,491
希望你進入政界之後
I hope that you've not lost your sense of humor

395
00:38:09,595 --> 00:38:12,155
沒有喪失幽默感      我並不擔心這個
since entering politics.        Not that I'm aware.

396
00:38:12,264 --> 00:38:13,856
那麼你想必意識到《造謠學校》（英國古典派喜劇）
Then I'm sure you realize that School for Scandal

397
00:38:13,966 --> 00:38:16,992
是被當作喜劇來描寫      是的
was written as a comedy.        Yes.

398
00:38:17,102 --> 00:38:21,095
儘管從我的角度看來 它更像是悲劇
Although, from where I sat, it read as a tragedy.

399
00:38:21,206 --> 00:38:25,142
夫人!我們多想念你啊
Your Grace! How we have missed you.

400
00:38:25,244 --> 00:38:26,233
缺了你
In your absence,

401
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:29,075
倫敦變得沉悶不堪
London has been reduced to the dreariest province.

402
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:31,911
這位是劇作家謝裡丹先生
And this, of course, is the playwright Mr. Sheridan.

403
00:38:32,017 --> 00:38:34,315
請容許我介紹伊麗莎白·福斯特夫人
May I present the Lady Elizabeth Foster?

404
00:38:34,419 --> 00:38:35,545
我並非有意打擾
I do not mean to be rude,

405
00:38:35,654 --> 00:38:37,815
但我的所有演員都極想覲見公爵夫人
but I've an entire cast dying to meet the Duchess.

406
00:38:37,923 --> 00:38:40,653
一會就把你送回來 我保證
I shall return you in a moment. Promise.

407
00:38:43,462 --> 00:38:44,429
福克斯先生?      嗯?
Mr. Fox?        Yes.

408
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,554
借一步說話
A word.

409
00:38:45,664 --> 00:38:50,294
我在哪裡發掘國內醜聞的題材呢?
Well, wherever do I glean such domestic gossip?

410
00:38:50,402 --> 00:38:51,489
這樣對公爵大人公平嗎?
Were we fair on the Duke?

411
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:53,406
本來還可以更糟糕的
It could have been worse.

412
00:38:53,605 --> 00:38:56,301
我原定的劇名是《糟糕的婚姻》
My original title was The Bad Marriage.

413
00:39:00,279 --> 00:39:02,577
情況真的是這樣的嗎?
Is it always like this?

414
00:39:02,681 --> 00:39:04,478
噯 正如他們所說
Well, as they say,

415
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:06,813
德文郡公爵是全英國唯一
the Duke of Devonshire must be the only man in England

416
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:08,819
不愛慕他妻子的人
not in love with his wife.

417
00:39:10,689 --> 00:39:12,489
這位是德文郡公爵夫人
Her Grace, the Duchess of Devonshire.

418
00:39:12,489 --> 00:39:13,391
很榮幸見到您
Very pleased to meet you.

419
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:24,893
你已拋開那一切 玩得開心嗎?
Were you at all able to forget things and enjoy yourself?

420
00:39:25,003 --> 00:39:28,939
這是很好的娛樂 謝謝
It was a wonderful distraction, thank you.

421
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:30,133
很好
Good.

422
00:39:33,745 --> 00:39:38,155
我一整晚都在和格雷先生交談      是嗎?
I talked to Mr. Grey all evening.        Yes?

423
00:39:39,184 --> 00:39:40,674
他愛上你了
He's in love with you.

424
00:39:40,786 --> 00:39:45,849
親愛的貝絲 不 他不是的 恐怕剛好相反
My dear Bess, no, he is not. Quite the reverse, I fear.

425
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:49,655
你難道感覺不到他凝視你的眼神嗎?
Well, can't you tell by the way he looks at you?

426
00:39:49,761 --> 00:39:52,696
說真的 你真的感覺不到嗎?      別說了
Honestly, can't you tell?        Stop it.

427
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,583
喬治亞娜 交合併不只是為了後嗣
Georgiana, intercourse is not just about offspring.

428
00:40:01,373 --> 00:40:06,572
事實上 是可以很愉悅的      我知道
In fact, it can be rather pleasurable.        Yes, I know.

429
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:14,317
閉上眼睛想像一下
Close your eyes and try to envisage Grey

430
00:40:14,419 --> 00:40:18,549
格雷先生掀開你的裙子 親吻你的後背
opening your dress, kissing your back.

431
00:40:18,657 --> 00:40:21,649
他們不會做那樣的事      會的 他們會
They never do such things.        Yes, they do.

432
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,893
閉上你的眼睛
Close your eyes.

433
00:40:36,441 --> 00:40:41,140
格雷在你背後慢慢的打開你的裙子
Grey is behind you slowly opening your dress.

434
00:40:41,246 --> 00:40:43,646
不 貝絲 別說了!      閉上眼
No, Bess, stop!        Close your eyes.

435
00:41:00,198 --> 00:41:01,859
親吻你的後背
Kissing your back.

436
00:41:33,856 --> 00:41:35,016
那裡
There.

437
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:37,589
明白了吧?
See?

438
00:42:10,193 --> 00:42:12,405
失陪一下
Would you excuse me for a minute?

439
00:42:12,495 --> 00:42:14,929
夫人      格雷先生
Your Grace.        Mr. Grey.

440
00:42:15,031 --> 00:42:17,659
選舉在六星期後舉行 是吧?
The national election is in six weeks, yes?

441
00:42:17,767 --> 00:42:19,792
競選進行得怎樣了?
How is the campaign going?

442
00:42:22,672 --> 00:42:23,900
很糟糕
Terribly.

443
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:28,533
我們唯一的希望的是為福克斯保住威斯敏斯特
Our only hope is to save Westminster for Fox.

444
00:42:28,644 --> 00:42:30,874
正如你所知 我有很多毛病
I have many faults, as you well know.

445
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:34,609
其中包括善於吸引別人的目光
Not least among them is my ability to draw attention.

446
00:42:35,752 --> 00:42:38,585
也許我們可以利用那點作為我們的優勢
Perhaps we could use that to our advantage.

447
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:56,467
女士們先生們
Ladies and gentlemen.

448
00:42:58,174 --> 00:42:59,428
女士們先生們
Ladies and gentlemen,

449
00:43:01,277 --> 00:43:03,776
我向你們介紹 指引我們該做何事
I give you the man who will inform us of the work we must do

450
00:43:04,044 --> 00:43:08,710
該信何黨派的人 查爾斯·格雷先生
and of the party we so believe in. Mr. Charles Grey.

451
00:43:16,659 --> 00:43:20,026
威斯敏斯特的人們!
Good people of Westminster!

452
00:43:20,129 --> 00:43:25,431
世界正面臨崩潰或得救的邊緣
The world is on the brink of disaster or salvation!

453
00:43:25,535 --> 00:43:27,196
從法國到美洲
From France to America,

454
00:43:27,303 --> 00:43:30,295
男人和女人都在為自己的自由而奮鬥
men and women are struggling to free themselves,

455
00:43:30,406 --> 00:43:33,807
尋找自我存在的價值!
to find meaning in their existence!

456
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:36,813
變革就在我們眼前!
Change is upon us!

457
00:43:38,881 --> 00:43:41,577
我們不應倒退回舊日
We shall not go back to the old ways.

458
00:43:41,684 --> 00:43:46,849
應當把英國帶進勇敢的新時代
We shall take England into this brave new world

459
00:43:46,956 --> 00:43:50,125
撼動天空!
and shake the thunder from the skies!

460
00:44:02,805 --> 00:44:07,538
我表現得怎樣?      我覺得你並不困窘
How did I do?        I think it was not an embarrassment.

461
00:44:09,045 --> 00:44:11,275
真是奇跡
It was a marvel.

462
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:15,744
我很緊張 你的到場令我的緊張放大了三倍
I was nervous. Your presence trebled the numbers at least.

463
00:44:19,388 --> 00:44:22,006
即使現在 我仍然緊張
I'm nervous even now.

464
00:44:22,007 --> 00:44:27,228
假如我能贏得選舉 假如我得到權力
If we win this election, if we get the power,

465
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:29,298
想想我們能做什麼
think what we will do.

466
00:44:29,398 --> 00:44:32,196
我們分開的時候 你有想我嗎?
Do you think of me when we're not together?

467
00:44:33,402 --> 00:44:36,894
你知道我有的
You ought to know I do.

468
00:44:37,006 --> 00:44:40,140
在回答之前 你猶豫了      不
You hesitated before you replied.        No.

469
00:44:49,452 --> 00:44:52,342
從來沒有人這麼直接問我
I'm unused to being asked so directly.

470
00:44:55,491 --> 00:44:57,516
無論是你還是其他人
And by you, of all people.

471
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:05,928
我一直在想著你 無時無刻都想
I think of you all the time. I always have.

472
00:45:11,741 --> 00:45:14,733
您的馬車在等著呢 夫人      謝謝
Your carriage awaits, Your Grace.        Thank you.

473
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:19,011
...我們就此立誓
...this we vow!

474
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:49,572
你們在伊麗莎白夫人的房間外面做什麼?
What are you doing outside Lady Elizabeth's room?

475
00:45:54,951 --> 00:45:56,919
誰和她在裡面?
Who's in there with her?

476
00:47:03,183 --> 00:47:09,179
英國有那麼多女人 你偏偏要纏上她
Of all the women in England you had to throw yourself on her.

477
00:47:13,393 --> 00:47:19,306
我從未拒絕過你任何事
I have never once objected to any of your affairs.

478
00:47:21,234 --> 00:47:25,295
我接受所有你作出的安排
I have accepted whatever arrangement you have proposed.

479
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:31,433
我將夏洛特視為己出
I have raised Charlotte as my own daughter.

480
00:47:33,647 --> 00:47:35,012
但這個...
But this...

481
00:47:38,118 --> 00:47:42,248
這是我唯一僅剩的
I have one single thing of my own.

482
00:47:45,492 --> 00:47:49,533
你為什麼不能把伊麗莎白留給我?
Why couldn't you let me keep Elizabeth for myself?

483
00:47:51,097 --> 00:47:54,705
你到底是什麼人啊?
What kind of man are you?

484
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:59,858
在我們的婚姻生活裡 她是唯一能給我慰藉的
She is my sole comfort in our marriage.

485
00:47:59,858 --> 00:48:02,772
你搶走了我唯一的朋友!
You have robbed me of my only friend!

486
00:48:12,052 --> 00:48:13,917
我犯了什麼錯?
What is wrong with me?

487
00:48:39,312 --> 00:48:40,370
我...
l...

488
00:48:42,415 --> 00:48:48,786
我沒說過我是感性的人 喬
I've never claimed to be a man of fine sensibility, G.

489
00:48:48,888 --> 00:48:52,153
但我很清楚自己想從這段婚姻中得到什麼
But I've always known what I expect from this marriage

490
00:48:52,258 --> 00:48:54,488
和付出什麼
and what I'm prepared to give.

491
00:48:55,762 --> 00:48:59,755
作為丈夫 我履行了自己的義務
As a husband, I have fulfilled my obligations.

492
00:48:59,866 --> 00:49:03,932
但作為妻子
But, as a wife,

493
00:49:05,505 --> 00:49:07,632
你沒有
you have not.

494
00:49:07,741 --> 00:49:11,142
她要離開 馬上就走
She has to go. Now.

495
00:49:11,244 --> 00:49:13,838
再也不能踏入這房子半步!
She is never to set foot in this house again!

496
00:49:13,947 --> 00:49:15,881
喬 控制一下自己的脾氣 你太失禮了
Do mind your temper, G. You're forgetting yourself.

497
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:18,874
我要她走
I want her out.

498
00:49:21,121 --> 00:49:23,055
我再也不想見到她
I never want to lay eyes on her again.

499
00:49:23,055 --> 00:49:25,856
下去叫她馬上走
Go down and tell her to leave at once.

500
00:49:30,463 --> 00:49:32,397
我不能要她那麼做
I couldn't ask her that.

501
00:49:35,068 --> 00:49:36,695
我不會那樣做 喬
I won't do it, G.

502
00:49:53,987 --> 00:49:55,609
從一開始我就不喜歡她
I never liked her from the first.

503
00:49:56,859 --> 00:49:59,155
你說得很清楚了 母親
You made that quite clear, Mama.

504
00:49:59,292 --> 00:50:02,022
但願她已經離開了德文郡莊園
She's gone from Devonshire House, I hope.

505
00:50:06,099 --> 00:50:08,090
他們一起住在那裡?
They're living there together?

506
00:50:08,201 --> 00:50:10,533
喬治亞娜!你居然容忍這樣的事?
Georgiana! What have you permitted to happen?

507
00:50:10,637 --> 00:50:14,266
我不知道 我不知道
I don't know. I don't know.

508
00:50:14,374 --> 00:50:18,926
幫我 幫幫我 求你了 母親 告訴我該怎麼辦
Help me. Help me, please, Mama. Tell me what to do.

509
00:50:22,582 --> 00:50:26,678
你得寫信給丈夫 堅持要求送走她
You must write to your husband and insist he send her back

510
00:50:26,786 --> 00:50:28,947
回她原來呆的糟糕地方
to whatever horrid little place she came from.

511
00:50:29,055 --> 00:50:34,658
他不會的 他說"這是不可能的"
He will not. ''It is out of the question,'' he says.

512
00:50:39,566 --> 00:50:43,400
那麼你要回去 履行為人妻子的義務
Then you must return and resume your duties.

513
00:50:43,503 --> 00:50:46,028
讓她知道他真正愛的人是誰
Make him realize whom he loves.

514
00:50:46,139 --> 00:50:48,903
你要放棄政治生活和賭博
You will give up your politics and your gambling.

515
00:50:49,008 --> 00:50:52,307
這次 你要全心全意做個好妻子
For once, you will devote yourself as a loving wife

516
00:50:52,412 --> 00:50:56,371
親手解決問題 給他生一個繼承人
and settle down to the task in hand, providing him with an heir.

517
00:50:57,784 --> 00:51:00,014
那麼他很快就會厭倦她
Then he will soon tire of her.

518
00:51:08,828 --> 00:51:10,819
你沒有其他選擇
You have no other option.

519
00:51:49,769 --> 00:51:51,066
你好 喬
Hello, G.

520
00:51:53,339 --> 00:51:54,567
威廉
William.

521
00:52:28,007 --> 00:52:32,000
我也許無權將你趕出房子
I may not have the authority to remove you from my house,

522
00:52:32,111 --> 00:52:34,739
但我至少可以命令你離開我的房間
but I can, at least, order you out of my room.

523
00:52:34,847 --> 00:52:37,213
你就不能聽我解釋嗎?
Won't you please let me explain?

524
00:52:38,818 --> 00:52:39,876
沒什麼好解釋的
There is nothing to explain.

525
00:52:39,986 --> 00:52:43,478
這是我見孩子們的唯一機會
This is my only chance of ever seeing my children again.

526
00:52:44,757 --> 00:52:46,952
公爵是英國最有權勢的貴族
The Duke is the most powerful peer in England.

527
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:48,288
他是我唯一的機會
He is my only chance.

528
00:52:48,394 --> 00:52:52,330
即使是為了孩子 犧牲也是有個限度的
There are limits to the sacrifices one makes for one's children.

529
00:52:52,432 --> 00:52:57,253
不 不是的 犧牲一切也不為過
No, there aren't. No limits whatsoever.

530
00:52:59,672 --> 00:53:00,900
出去
Get out.

531
00:53:04,844 --> 00:53:07,813
我們之間沒什麼好說的
We have nothing more to say to one another.

532
00:54:00,733 --> 00:54:02,064
媽媽 媽媽
Mama, Mama!

533
00:54:09,475 --> 00:54:12,035
見到你真好 媽媽
It's so nice to see you, Mama.

534
00:54:12,145 --> 00:54:14,705
是的 這是獵槍
Right, this is a shotgun.

535
00:54:14,814 --> 00:54:16,748
你母親說你會感興趣的 對嗎?
Your mother said you'd be interested, yes?

536
00:54:16,849 --> 00:54:17,873
是的
Yes.

537
00:54:19,485 --> 00:54:21,180
這是打火石 你看到了嗎?
This is a flint. Do you see?

538
00:54:21,287 --> 00:54:24,313
當打火石撞到這裡 就會產生火花
When the flint hits there, it causes a spark to happen.

539
00:54:24,424 --> 00:54:27,711
火花點燃火藥
Now, the spark, it lights the gunpowder

540
00:54:27,711 --> 00:54:30,136
把子彈推出槍外
and sends the bullet out of the gun.

541
00:54:30,396 --> 00:54:32,523
你知道怎麼拿槍嗎?      不知道 先生
Do you know how to hold it?        No, sir.

542
00:54:32,632 --> 00:54:34,146
是這樣的 
Well, it's like that. 

543
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:38,299
夾在右邊腋窩下
Tuck it in there,into your right shoulder.

544
00:54:38,299 --> 00:54:39,262
緊緊的托住
Hold it firmly,

545
00:54:39,262 --> 00:54:41,903
那隻手可以再挪遠一點
then you can move that hand a little further along.

546
00:54:41,908 --> 00:54:45,935
你感受到它的重量了吧?要再往前傾一點
Can you feel how heavy it is? You have to lean into it a bit.

547
00:54:46,045 --> 00:54:50,004
兩隻眼睛保持睜開 順著槍管看過去
And keep both eyes open. Look right along the barrel.

548
00:54:50,116 --> 00:54:52,482
就是這樣
Right along there just like that.

549
00:54:54,454 --> 00:54:58,356
砰!來 我做給你看看
Bang! Here, let me show you.

550
00:55:02,061 --> 00:55:03,392
那裡
There.

551
00:55:04,297 --> 00:55:06,424
很沉 是吧?
It's quite heavy, isn't it?

552
00:55:07,767 --> 00:55:11,760
你口渴嗎?要不要喝點什麼?
Are you thirsty? Would you like something to drink?

553
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:15,398
你們口渴嗎?要喝點什麼嗎?
Are you gentlemen thirsty? Would you like something to drink?

554
00:55:17,643 --> 00:55:18,974
謝謝
Thank you.

555
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,926
你有沒有告訴公爵要見什麼人呢?
Did you tell the Duke who you were meeting?

556
00:56:15,034 --> 00:56:16,058
沒有
No.

557
00:56:16,936 --> 00:56:18,870
那他問了嗎?      沒有
Did he even ask?        No.

558
00:56:20,006 --> 00:56:22,167
他還有別的事情要想
He has other things on his mind.

559
00:56:23,876 --> 00:56:25,275
你也一樣
As do you.

560
00:56:29,715 --> 00:56:33,186
你要是說出來會不會好一點?
Would it help to unburden yourself?

561
00:56:34,954 --> 00:56:37,445
我不能跟你討論那些事
It's nothing I can discuss with you.

562
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:41,138
就算說了也徒增煩惱而已
Besides, it would only bore.

563
00:56:42,395 --> 00:56:45,330
你不需要總是取悅別人
You don't have to please others all the time.

564
00:56:45,431 --> 00:56:46,625
我從小的教育就是這樣 
It's what I've been brought up to do. 

565
00:56:46,625 --> 00:56:48,926
想改掉還挺困難的
Difficult lesson to unlearn.

566
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:55,507
我可否發表一個見解?
Would you permit me an observation?

567
00:56:59,812 --> 00:57:02,940
我認為你這麼做是為了讓人們喜歡你
I believe you do it so that people will love you.

568
00:57:03,783 --> 00:57:06,843
你憑什麼這麼說?      憑我所看到的
What makes you say that?        From what I've seen.

569
00:57:08,588 --> 00:57:14,442
從你的丈夫 你的朋友 尤其是貝絲夫人
With your husband, your friends, especially Lady Bess,

570
00:57:15,862 --> 00:57:17,454
甚至是其他公眾
even the public.

571
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:22,193
我以前還從來沒這麼想過
I never thought of it that way before.

572
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:26,365
你說得我好像很可憐
You make me sound so pitiable.

573
00:57:32,245 --> 00:57:33,542
喬治安娜
Georgiana.

574
00:57:35,781 --> 00:57:40,087
我說過頭了 我向你道歉
I've gone beyond my brief. I apologize.

575
00:57:41,454 --> 00:57:44,855
請相信我這麼說是為你好
Please believe it was only for your sake that I spoke.

576
00:57:46,158 --> 00:57:48,353
請告訴我到底出什麼事了
Please, tell me what is wrong.

577
00:57:52,965 --> 00:57:56,799
我想我的一生裡有些事情做得太晚
I fear I've done some things in life too late

578
00:57:56,903 --> 00:57:58,734
有些做得太早
and others too early.

579
00:58:03,376 --> 00:58:05,363
不 你沒有
No, you haven't.

580
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,891
對不起
I'm sorry.

581
00:58:59,899 --> 00:59:01,230
謝謝
Thank you.

582
00:59:17,917 --> 00:59:19,248
好了
All right.

583
00:59:22,588 --> 00:59:23,953
好了?
''All right''?

584
00:59:27,493 --> 00:59:29,393
你們兩情相悅嗎?
Do you love each other?

585
00:59:32,131 --> 00:59:36,261
喬治安娜      你喜歡貝絲嗎? 大人
Georgiana...        Do you love Bess, Your Grace?

586
00:59:37,937 --> 00:59:42,013
這是幹什麼?      我對他別無所求
Where is all this leading?        I make no demands on him.

587
00:59:43,776 --> 00:59:45,781
貝絲 你喜歡我丈夫嗎?      
And, Bess, do you love my husband?       

588
00:59:46,645 --> 00:59:48,326
跟我對你是一樣的
As I do you.

589
00:59:50,916 --> 00:59:52,941
所以你打算留下來?
And so you intend to stay?

590
00:59:55,988 --> 00:59:58,081
威廉叫我留下來
William has asked that I do.

591
00:59:59,492 --> 01:00:02,655
你從心底無法拒絕他吧?
You couldn't find it in your heart to refuse him?

592
01:00:04,897 --> 01:00:05,989
是的
No.

593
01:00:10,336 --> 01:00:11,637
那我們定個協議吧
Then let us make a deal.

594
01:00:13,205 --> 01:00:15,833
協議?      是的
A deal?        Yes.

595
01:00:18,678 --> 01:00:21,875
我願意成全你們
I give you my blessing

596
01:00:21,981 --> 01:00:26,582
如果你可以接受我對查爾斯·格雷的感情
if you will accept my feelings for Charles Grey.

597
01:00:28,387 --> 01:00:29,979
我起初沒有意識到
I didn't realize it at first.

598
01:00:30,089 --> 01:00:34,483
我以為那也許只是一種調情
I thought that perhaps it was only a dalliance.

599
01:00:35,094 --> 01:00:36,891
它讓我感到快樂
It can make me happy.

600
01:00:41,801 --> 01:00:44,599
協議? 協議
A deal? A deal.

601
01:00:46,172 --> 01:00:48,800
我不跟人定協議
I don't make deals.

602
01:00:49,075 --> 01:00:50,508
為什麼要呢?
Why would l?

603
01:00:53,045 --> 01:00:54,239
一切都是由我在主宰
I'm in charge of it all.

604
01:00:54,346 --> 01:00:58,908
我可以找他出來 我可以挑戰他
You know, I would call him out. I would challenge him.

605
01:00:59,018 --> 01:01:00,645
我可以一槍打爆他的頭      威廉
I'd put a bullet in his head.        William.

606
01:01:00,753 --> 01:01:01,622
安靜些 
Be quiet. 

607
01:01:01,622 --> 01:01:04,850
你是決心要讓我淪為大笑柄嗎?
Are you determined to make me a total laughingstock?

608
01:01:04,957 --> 01:01:07,687
一個無法生兒子的人 一個戴綠帽的人?
A man who cannot sire a son, and then a cuckold?

609
01:01:07,793 --> 01:01:09,954
威廉 喬治安娜只是說我們...
William. Georgiana only asks what we ourselves...

610
01:01:10,062 --> 01:01:11,654
安靜些! 你這女人!
Be quiet, woman!

611
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:16,359
你是他的婊子嗎?      不是
Are you his whore?        No.

612
01:01:17,636 --> 01:01:19,797
但我不知道你為什麼要介意
But I can't see why you'd mind.

613
01:01:19,905 --> 01:01:24,044
你有貝絲 還有三個兒子      三個兒子?
You have Bess and three boys!        Three boys?

614
01:01:25,511 --> 01:01:28,605
你覺得我會讓那些雜種做我的繼承人嗎?
Do you think I can make those bastards my heirs?

615
01:01:30,449 --> 01:01:32,280
是嗎 你這樣認為?
Well? Do you?

616
01:01:42,461 --> 01:01:43,723
威廉!
William!

617
01:02:15,995 --> 01:02:17,986
你一點也不瞭解我 是吧?
You don't know me in the least, do you?

618
01:02:18,097 --> 01:02:19,894
不 我知道我們是很不合適的一對
Yes, I do. We're a bad match.

619
01:02:19,999 --> 01:02:24,197
當我們結婚時 我要的是兩件事 忠誠和兒子
I asked but two things when we wed, loyalty and a male heir.

620
01:02:24,303 --> 01:02:26,669
跟你對狗的要求一樣
The same as your dogs!

621
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:34,803
不 別碰我 別碰我
No, don't touch me! Don't touch me!

622
01:02:37,850 --> 01:02:39,147
放開我
Get off!

623
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:46,787
放開我
Get off me!

624
01:02:46,892 --> 01:02:51,226
你對她也是這樣嗎?你對那個賤人也是這樣嗎?
Is this how you treat her? Is this how you treat your whore?

625
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:53,355
不! 不!
No! No!

626
01:02:54,533 --> 01:02:57,559
不! 不! 不!
No! No! No!

627
01:02:58,437 --> 01:02:59,699
不!
No!

628
01:03:03,876 --> 01:03:06,470
跟我來 夏洛特 跟我來
Come with me. Charlotte, come with me.

629
01:03:07,646 --> 01:03:09,273
不! 不!
No! No!

630
01:03:31,871 --> 01:03:33,175
給我生個兒子 
Give me a son. 

631
01:03:33,374 --> 01:03:39,217
在那之前 好好呆著 老實聽我的話
Until then, stay here and do as I say.

632
01:03:54,593 --> 01:04:00,532
勝出者是福克斯先生! 人民的選擇!
I give you the winner. Mr. Fox, the man of the people!

633
01:04:07,406 --> 01:04:13,242
請容許我隆重介紹德文郡的公爵夫人
And I give you the weapon, the Duchess of Devonshire.

634
01:04:25,291 --> 01:04:26,883
謝謝
Thank you.

635
01:04:26,992 --> 01:04:31,875
謝謝你們 謝謝各位參加今天的招待會
Thank you, all of you, for this reception today.

636
01:04:33,532 --> 01:04:39,903
今天我們贏得了選舉 明天我們要構建未來
Today we have won the vote. Tomorrow we define the future!

637
01:04:52,184 --> 01:04:54,152
公爵     公爵
Your Grace.        Your Grace.

638
01:04:57,690 --> 01:04:59,885
公爵      公爵
Your Grace.        Your Grace.

639
01:05:03,262 --> 01:05:04,559
公爵
Your Grace.

640
01:05:10,669 --> 01:05:12,159
公爵      公爵
Your Grace.        Your Grace.

641
01:05:32,791 --> 01:05:35,692
公爵夫人 能否請您跳支舞?
Will Your Grace give me the favor of a dance?

642
01:05:59,485 --> 01:06:00,816
站穩點 喬
Steady, G.

643
01:06:05,624 --> 01:06:08,149
著火了!      喬治安娜!
Fire!        Georgiana!

644
01:06:09,228 --> 01:06:10,286
夫人!
Your Grace!

645
01:06:10,763 --> 01:06:12,253
夫人的頭髮!
Her Grace's hair!

646
01:06:15,234 --> 01:06:16,565
想想辦法啊!
Do something!

647
01:06:28,347 --> 01:06:30,713
請把夫人頭髮上的火滅掉
Please put out Her Grace's hair.

648
01:07:06,485 --> 01:07:08,510
夫人需要休息
Her Grace needs to rest.

649
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:10,679
只要她謹遵醫囑
As long as she follows strict instructions

650
01:07:10,789 --> 01:07:13,758
生產就不應該會有問題
there should be no impediment to the birth.

651
01:07:13,859 --> 01:07:15,918
你說什麼?
What are you talking about?

652
01:07:16,895 --> 01:07:18,954
公爵夫人有孕了
The Duchess is pregnant.

653
01:07:46,409 --> 01:07:48,769
德文郡
Devonshire

654
01:07:50,262 --> 01:07:51,593
還有這裡
And there.

655
01:07:54,967 --> 01:07:56,594
謝謝你 希頓
Thank you, Heaton.

656
01:08:00,506 --> 01:08:01,700
進來
Come.

657
01:08:13,886 --> 01:08:15,251
夫人

658
01:08:16,889 --> 01:08:22,170
按照公爵大人的繼承權條約 這是給你的
As per the terms of His Grace's inheritance, this is for you

659
01:08:22,494 --> 01:08:24,291
任你支配
to spend as you wish.

660
01:08:28,967 --> 01:08:30,594
終於成功了
Success at last.

661
01:08:39,311 --> 01:08:40,608
喬治安娜
Georgiana.

662
01:08:42,915 --> 01:08:45,941
我對此也深感痛恨
I, too, abhor this whole thing.

663
01:09:05,404 --> 01:09:06,928
換還是不換?
Twist or stick?

664
01:09:08,373 --> 01:09:11,302
不換      不換?
Stick.        Stick?

665
01:09:11,643 --> 01:09:13,474
那我也不換了
I'll stick, too, then.

666
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:16,745
翻開看看
Let's see.

667
01:09:17,616 --> 01:09:19,345
你贏了 真厲害
You won. Well done.

668
01:09:34,466 --> 01:09:36,491
媽媽 你忘了發牌了
Mama, you forgot to deal.

669
01:09:56,021 --> 01:09:59,636
夫人      格雷先生
Your Grace.        Mr. Grey.

670
01:10:00,559 --> 01:10:03,619
你從法國被召回了?      暫時的
You are recalled from France?        For a while.

671
01:10:03,729 --> 01:10:05,356
還沒有革命嗎?
No revolution yet?

672
01:10:06,832 --> 01:10:09,699
還沒有 不過是遲早的事
No, not yet, but it's only a matter of time.

673
01:10:12,371 --> 01:10:17,360
你怎麼會來這裡?      我接到一個請柬
How is it you are here?        I received an invitation.

674
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:22,440
我以為那是黨派的邀請 不能拒絕
I assumed it was on behalf of the Party. I could not say no.

675
01:10:22,581 --> 01:10:23,912
那是自然
Of course.

676
01:10:31,256 --> 01:10:32,723
我生了個兒子
I bore a son.

677
01:10:35,527 --> 01:10:36,653
是嗎
Yes.

他叫威廉·喬治·斯賓塞·卡文迪什 
His name is William George Spencer Cavendish,

679
01:10:42,526 --> 01:10:44,248
哈廷頓侯爵
Marquis of Hartington. 

680
01:10:46,723 --> 01:10:47,333
我們叫他哈特
We call him Hart.

681
01:10:47,439 --> 01:10:49,703
你和公爵一定都很高興吧
You and the Duke must be very pleased.

682
01:10:49,808 --> 01:10:51,070
是的
We are.

683
01:10:55,047 --> 01:10:57,811
公爵到倫敦慶祝去了
The Duke has gone to London to celebrate.

684
01:11:03,855 --> 01:11:07,441
我想你
You have been missed.

685
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,993
很想你
Much missed.

686
01:11:17,235 --> 01:11:19,362
Q押5

687
01:11:19,471 --> 01:11:21,439
請停止下注

688
01:11:24,443 --> 01:11:27,537
輸牌是 4
The losing card, four.

689
01:11:30,615 --> 01:11:33,311
贏牌是 Q
The winning card, Queen.

690
01:11:59,644 --> 01:12:02,044
好極了 八押3
Jolly good. Eight on the three.

691
01:12:02,147 --> 01:12:03,910
在5上押五
Put five on the five.

692
01:12:05,984 --> 01:12:08,214
5都已經沒了 喬
All of the fives have gone, G.

693
01:12:11,523 --> 01:12:13,718
我累得不想再玩了
I think I'm too tired to play.

694
01:12:16,795 --> 01:12:19,059
先生們 失陪了     夫人
Gentlemen.        Your Grace.

695
01:12:31,009 --> 01:12:32,340
喬治安娜
Georgiana.

696
01:12:34,246 --> 01:12:35,907
不可讓任何人知道
No one must know.

697
01:12:37,315 --> 01:12:40,113
是你召回格雷的?     晚安
You summoned Grey.        Good night.

698
01:14:54,039 --> 01:14:56,507
我打算去巴斯
I was thinking about going to Bath.

699
01:15:00,612 --> 01:15:03,541
貝絲 我去休養時
Bess, you can stay here 

700
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:07,552
你可以留下來照顧我們的丈夫
and look after our husband whilst I take the cure.

701
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:11,287
是呀 威廉 為什麼不呢?
Yes, William. Why not?

702
01:15:11,390 --> 01:15:14,985
如果她現在去了 在你有空時我們可以去找她
If G goes now, we can catch up with her when you're free.

703
01:15:16,195 --> 01:15:17,890
好吧 如果你一定要去
Well, if you must.

704
01:15:30,976 --> 01:15:32,174
"德文郡的公爵夫人"
"The Duchess of Devonshire "

705
01:15:32,174 --> 01:15:35,412
"上周戴著室內帽出現在巴斯"
"appeared last week in Bath in a mobcap."

706
01:15:36,223 --> 01:15:37,517
"自從公爵夫人"
"Her Grace,"

707
01:15:37,517 --> 01:15:39,303
"被邀請參與選舉活動以來"
ever since initiation into the business of electioneering,"

708
01:15:39,485 --> 01:15:41,640
"她就跟公眾走得很近"
"has been much attached to the mobs."

709
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,080
非常好
Very good.

710
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:49,022
你最喜歡哪一個
So which one is your favorite?

711
01:15:52,231 --> 01:15:54,426
這一個      是呀
This one.        Yeah.

712
01:15:56,668 --> 01:15:59,957
這張好像是你難得一次連贏幾把
In this one it seems you've hit a winning streak, for once.

713
01:15:59,957 --> 01:16:01,370
非常好
Very good.

714
01:16:04,176 --> 01:16:06,701
而這一張...
And in this one you see...

715
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:09,852
穿這身衣服去吸引投票者合適嗎?
Is that dress really an appropriate way to attract voters?

716
01:16:10,716 --> 01:16:14,152
你們政治家對服裝真是一無所知
You politicians know absolutely nothing about fashion.

717
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:19,090
如果你真的問我最喜歡哪一個
But if you were to really ask me which my favorite was,

718
01:16:20,893 --> 01:16:22,861
我會說是這一個
I'd say it was this one.

719
01:16:37,476 --> 01:16:39,569
早上好 查爾斯      早上好
Morning, Charles.        Morning.

720
01:16:39,678 --> 01:16:41,111
你好 先生
Good day to you, sir.

721
01:17:06,772 --> 01:17:10,463
非常好 謝謝
It's perfect. Thank you.

722
01:17:34,967 --> 01:17:37,333
還以為會給你一個驚喜呢 喬
Thought we would surprise you, G.

723
01:17:37,469 --> 01:17:39,333
我記得你說過我們的婚姻生活裡
I think you once said there wasn't enough spontaneity 

724
01:17:39,333 --> 01:17:40,528
欠缺一些主動
in our marriage

725
01:17:40,528 --> 01:17:42,373
或是類似的話
or words to that effect.

726
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:48,141
母親 你怎麼會來這裡
Mama, what are you doing here?

727
01:17:49,781 --> 01:17:54,150
你見過我們在巴斯的一些朋友嗎?
So, have you seen many of our circle in Bath?

728
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:57,047
見過一些
Some.

729
01:17:58,357 --> 01:18:03,693
科克斯一家還有哈弗福德和威克洛男爵
The Cokes and Haverford and Lord Wicklow.

730
01:18:03,795 --> 01:18:08,219
還有一些政治家是吧 一些會議什麼的
Bunch of politicos, too, aren't there? Meetings and such.

731
01:18:08,333 --> 01:18:09,322
我想是吧
I believe.

732
01:18:09,434 --> 01:18:14,326
格雷在這裡嗎? 我是說查爾斯·格雷
Is Grey here? By which I mean Mr. Charles Grey.

733
01:18:14,806 --> 01:18:16,933
有傳聞說他在這裡
Rumor has it that he is.

734
01:18:17,042 --> 01:18:18,771
我不會放棄他的     喬治安娜
I won't give him up.        Georgiana.

735
01:18:18,877 --> 01:18:22,040
每個人都有一個心愛的人 貝絲是我丈夫的愛人
Everyone has a lover. Bess is the lover of my husband.

736
01:18:22,147 --> 01:18:23,808
如果你有任何的判斷能力
If you had shown some discretion,

737
01:18:23,915 --> 01:18:26,315
事情可能會更得很不同     很不同?
it might have been different.        Different?

738
01:18:26,418 --> 01:18:28,852
唯一幸運的是這一切還沒上過報紙
The only good fortune is it hasn't yet made it to the papers.

739
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:32,788
親愛的 格雷獨身 他沒有財產 沒有官爵
My dear, Grey is unmarried. He has no wealth, no rank.

740
01:18:32,891 --> 01:18:36,327
這件事他無需擔任何風險 你將承受所有傷害
He risks nothing with this affair. The hazard is all yours.

741
01:18:36,428 --> 01:18:39,261
格雷是愛我的     威廉也一樣
Grey loves me.        So does William.

742
01:18:39,364 --> 01:18:42,765
是的 我愛你
Yes. I love you.

743
01:18:44,403 --> 01:18:45,631
怎麼愛?
How?

744
01:18:47,439 --> 01:18:50,033
以我所理解的愛的方式
In the way I understand love.

745
01:18:53,078 --> 01:18:56,464
喬治安娜 這事做得太過頭了 
Georgiana, this has gone much too far. 

746
01:18:56,464 --> 01:18:57,872
有失我們的身份
It is beneath our dignity.

747
01:18:57,872 --> 01:19:00,249
整個倫敦都在談論     讓他們說吧
All London is talking.        Let them talk.

748
01:19:00,352 --> 01:19:02,877
如果格雷令我淪為墮落的女人 我不介意
If Grey makes me a fallen woman, well and good.

749
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:04,218
威廉可以跟我離婚 
Now William may divorce me 

750
01:19:04,218 --> 01:19:05,661
讓貝絲成為德文郡公爵夫人
and Bess becomes Duchess of Devonshire.

751
01:19:05,661 --> 01:19:07,455
這是不可能的
That will never happen.

752
01:19:09,661 --> 01:19:11,993
我不管了
I think I will leave you to it.

753
01:19:17,536 --> 01:19:19,731
現在要怎麼樣呢
What follows now?

754
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:21,265
你要撕開我的衣服
Are you going to tear my clothes off 

755
01:19:21,265 --> 01:19:23,140
再次對我用強嗎?
and force yourself upon me again?

756
01:19:23,208 --> 01:19:25,403
我為什麼要這麼做?
Why on earth would I do that?

757
01:19:26,311 --> 01:19:28,084
我知道你從未思考過
I know that you've never thought much of 

758
01:19:28,084 --> 01:19:32,193
我的才智和行事方式 喬
my manners or my intellect, G.

759
01:19:32,651 --> 01:19:36,815
但事實上 我從不做沒用的事
But, in fact, I never do anything that serves no purpose.

760
01:19:36,922 --> 01:19:39,789
我完全清楚你們為什麼在一起
I know precisely what you two have together.

761
01:19:39,891 --> 01:19:41,722
我們彼此相愛     我毫不懷疑
We love each other.        I do not doubt it.

762
01:19:41,827 --> 01:19:43,522
他跟你一樣是個理想主義者
He is a dreamer like yourself,

763
01:19:43,628 --> 01:19:45,202
你們都在夢想一個
and you both dream of another world 

764
01:19:45,202 --> 01:19:47,675
不曾也將不會存在的世界
that does not exist and it never will.

765
01:19:48,333 --> 01:19:51,962
在現實中呢 讓我給你點啟示
As for reality, allow me to enlighten you.

766
01:19:53,171 --> 01:19:55,855
如果你不立即與他斷絕關係 
If you do not give him up at once, 

767
01:19:56,217 --> 01:19:57,989
我會調查整個國家
I will see to it that every home 

768
01:19:57,989 --> 01:20:01,225
與他關聯所有家庭和賬本
and every checkbook in this country is closed to him.

769
01:20:01,646 --> 01:20:04,479
他將會為所有的政府部門
He will be welcomed neither in the halls of government

770
01:20:04,583 --> 01:20:07,177
和權力機構所拒絕
nor in its backrooms of power.

771
01:20:07,285 --> 01:20:10,083
他想成為首相的夢想
His dream of becoming prime minister

772
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:16,559
還有你們想要改變世界的幻想都將化為灰燼
and your mutual fantasy of a changed world will be dead as ash.

773
01:20:20,532 --> 01:20:23,399
而你也將永遠看不到你的孩子
And you will never see your children again.

774
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:34,242
喬治安娜
Georgiana.

775
01:21:19,624 --> 01:21:21,956
我要請你回倫敦去
I must ask you to return to London.

776
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:24,028
你不去?     是的
Without you?        Yes.

777
01:21:32,537 --> 01:21:34,937
這是我們的女兒讓我帶的
These are from our girls.

778
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,452
小哈特沒有寫 
Little Hart neglected to write, 

779
01:21:36,452 --> 01:21:39,951
他太小也寫不了
but then, of course, he's not yet one.

780
01:21:50,822 --> 01:21:55,544
這將是你一生中最大的錯誤     不
This will be the mistake of your life.        No.

781
01:21:57,295 --> 01:21:59,422
很多年前我已經犯過那個錯了
I made that many years ago.

782
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,866
我想你自己可以離開吧
I trust you can see yourself out.

783
01:22:25,257 --> 01:22:28,090
該死的 打門打開       是的 大人
Damn you, man, open the door!        Your Grace.

784
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:29,470
媽媽 媽媽 媽媽 媽媽
Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama!

785
01:24:34,052 --> 01:24:35,815
媽媽 媽媽 媽媽
Mama, Mama, Mama.

786
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:57,672
去吧 孩子們     媽媽 我愛你
Come on, girls.        Mama. I love you.

787
01:24:57,776 --> 01:25:01,576
孩子們 去吧 媽媽一會兒就來
Girls, run along. Your mother will join you in a minute.

788
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:02,907
來吧
Come on.

789
01:25:06,051 --> 01:25:07,382
去吧
Run along.

790
01:25:11,823 --> 01:25:12,847
喬
G.

791
01:25:27,138 --> 01:25:28,901
你知道我很高興
You must know how greatly pleased I am

792
01:25:29,007 --> 01:25:32,033
我們終於能夠達成妥協
that we have come to an arrangement.

793
01:25:32,143 --> 01:25:33,394
讓孩子們離開母親太久
It's not good for little ones to 

794
01:25:33,394 --> 01:25:35,765
不是件好事
be without their mother for so long.

795
01:25:36,347 --> 01:25:40,937
我的人生是為了他們     這是一種理解方式
My life for theirs.        That's one way of putting it.

796
01:25:42,687 --> 01:25:43,811
你母親稱之為
Your mother called it 

797
01:25:44,328 --> 01:25:46,940
"眾人尊嚴高於個人欲求"
"common decency before personal gratification,"

798
01:25:46,940 --> 01:25:49,658
或者是類似的話 具體我不記得
or some such thing. The exact words escape me.

799
01:25:49,761 --> 01:25:53,458
不如說"被囚困在自己的家中"
How about "imprisoned in my own house"?

800
01:25:56,167 --> 01:25:59,843
不 她不是這麼說的
No. That's not how she put it.

801
01:26:00,772 --> 01:26:03,825
否則我會記得
I would have remembered that.

802
01:26:27,532 --> 01:26:29,159
喬治安娜!
Georgiana!

803
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:32,100

805
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:41,143
喬治安娜! 請放開我!
Georgiana! Will you please unhand me?

806
01:26:41,246 --> 01:26:42,577
失陪一下
Excuse me.

807
01:26:49,754 --> 01:26:52,314
喬治安娜! 放開
Georgiana! Please.

808
01:26:54,025 --> 01:26:55,356
喬治安娜!
Georgiana!

809
01:26:56,928 --> 01:26:59,396
謝謝你 伯利     放開他
Thank you, Burleigh.        Let him go.

810
01:27:01,232 --> 01:27:03,465
我每天寄出十幾封信 
I have written a dozen times a day. 

811
01:27:03,465 --> 01:27:05,850
可沒有你的任何回音
Still, there is nothing from you.

812
01:27:07,038 --> 01:27:10,565
到底怎麼回事? 你不再愛我了嗎?
What has happened? Do you love me no longer?

813

我的個人感覺從未改變     
My personal feelings remain unaltered.        

814
01:27:14,027 --> 01:27:15,721
那我們就應該在一起
Then we must be together again.

815
01:27:16,581 --> 01:27:19,175
我想娶你 我想與你生兒育女
I want to marry you. I want you to bear my children.

816
01:27:19,284 --> 01:27:21,261
而我才不在乎是男孩還是女孩!
And I don't care if they're boys or girls!

817
01:27:21,261 --> 01:27:25,325
我也希望能夠這樣    可以的 會的
I wish it could be that way.        It can. It will.

818
01:27:25,723 --> 01:27:27,748
無論我們如何躲避 悲傷總是難免的
Sorrows will come however we try to avoid them.

819
01:27:27,859 --> 01:27:30,089
我們必須堅持到底 永不放棄
We must stay the course and never give in.

820
01:27:30,195 --> 01:27:32,959
不 查爾斯      你必須要跟我離開
No, Charles.        You must leave and be with me.

821
01:27:33,064 --> 01:27:35,225
做一個自由的女人 走吧 我們現在就走
A free woman. Now! Let us leave now!

822
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:38,063
我不能丟下我的孩子
I cannot abandon my children.

823
01:27:41,339 --> 01:27:44,035
好好想想你要我做的是什麼吧
Listen to what you are asking me to do.

824
01:28:37,195 --> 01:28:40,687
怎麼了? 不喜歡吃鴿子嗎?
What's the matter? Don't like the pigeon?

825
01:28:43,067 --> 01:28:44,932
我覺得挺好吃的
I find it quite decent.

826
01:28:52,610 --> 01:28:56,530
我懷了查爾斯·格雷的孩子
I'm carrying Charles Grey's child.

827
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:12,188

Please be so kind as to inform the Duchess of my decision.

828

事情的安排是這樣的
This is how it will be.

829
01:29:16,567 --> 01:29:17,808
你會被送到鄉下
You will be taken to the country 

830
01:29:17,808 --> 01:29:20,327
把孩子生下來
where you will give birth to the child,

831
01:29:20,734 --> 01:29:22,441
那孩子將會由查爾斯·格雷的家庭
and the child will be trusted to the care 

832
01:29:22,441 --> 01:29:24,395
撫養成人
of Charles Grey's family.

833
01:29:28,846 --> 01:29:30,507
你在聽嗎?
Are you listening?

834
01:29:31,516 --> 01:29:33,507
我想她聽到了 我們走吧
I think she's heard you. Let's leave her.

835
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:35,609
喬治安娜 拜託     我說我們走了
Georgiana, please.        I said let's leave.

836
01:29:35,753 --> 01:29:38,153
這不是在討論問題 她已經聽到我的決定了
This is not a discussion. She's been informed of my decision.

837
01:29:38,256 --> 01:29:40,224
對她有點同情心吧 威廉     同情什麼
Have pity on her, William.        Pity be damned.

838
01:29:40,325 --> 01:29:42,657
這是她自找的 你是清楚的
She's brought this upon herself, as well you know.

839
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:45,752
快走吧      不 我要跟她去
Now come.        No. I will go with her.

840
01:29:46,864 --> 01:29:48,422
你哪裡也不許去
But you're not going anywhere.

841
01:29:48,533 --> 01:29:50,228
我要跟她去 如果她願意的話
I will go with G, if G will have me,

842
01:29:50,335 --> 01:29:54,135
無論你做什麼說什麼都阻止不了我們
and there's nothing you can do or say to stop either of us.

843
01:30:47,592 --> 01:30:51,951
謝謝你來陪我     我不可以讓你單獨一人
Thank you for coming.        I couldn't not be with you.

844

該走了
It's time.

845
01:31:34,439 --> 01:31:37,067
要不要讓...      不 我要自己去
Would it help...        No, I must take her.

846

查爾斯呢?
Where's Charles?

848
01:33:09,133 --> 01:33:12,398
你丈夫說最好由我來處理這件事

Come on, G. I've got you. I've got you.

853
01:35:51,429 --> 01:35:54,990
我不是很擅於表達自己
I'm not particularly adept at expressing myself

854
01:35:55,099 --> 01:36:00,164
特別是在牽涉到個人情感時
when it comes to matters of a more personal nature.

855
01:36:01,706 --> 01:36:03,298
但是我想試一下
But I shall try.

856
01:36:06,310 --> 01:36:09,177
這幾年來 我的所作所為
Over the years, I have acted in ways

857
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:14,273
在你看來很無情
that you have judged to be harsh.

858
01:36:17,621 --> 01:36:21,908
我不會讓你再受任何折磨了
Well, I do not wish for you to undergo any further suffering.

859
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:29,818
事實上 我希望我們能擁有平靜的生活
In fact, I would like our lives to find a calm normality.

基於這幾年來
And given some of the vague reports 

863
01:36:46,165 --> 01:36:48,504
流傳的一些流言蜚語
that have been circulating this past year

864
01:36:48,504 --> 01:36:52,317
我覺得我們最好能出席
I think it would be wise for us to go.

865
01:36:52,990 --> 01:36:55,220
也可以說是表現一下和睦
