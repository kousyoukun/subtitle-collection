1
00:01:06,101 --> 00:01:08,228
Where have you been? I've been waiting since 7.

2
00:01:08,403 --> 00:01:10,803
Get in. I have to find fireworks.

3
00:01:10,973 --> 00:01:15,603
- Let me drive. - Get in. I haven't eaten in 24 hours.

4
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:19,672
Are you coming or not?

5
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:36,959
- - all next week at Ganzori Diamonds at 1 01 7 Fourth Street, San Rafael.

6
00:01:37,132 --> 00:01:39,430
Open till 9 Friday.

7
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:41,632
It's too crowded.

8
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,029
I thought you were starving.

9
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:48,041
Let's go somepIace quiet.

10
00:01:49,278 --> 00:01:50,939
Okay.

11
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,514
What are we doing?

12
00:02:05,294 --> 00:02:09,731
Sitting. Listening to music. TaIking.

13
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:12,692
You seem weird. Is everything okay?

14
00:02:12,868 --> 00:02:14,927
Yeah, everything's fine.

15
00:02:22,244 --> 00:02:24,940
It's JuIy. How many shirts are you wearing?

16
00:02:25,113 --> 00:02:28,276
- I'm coId. - You're coId on the Fourth of JuIy?

17
00:02:32,721 --> 00:02:35,155
Fuck off and die!

18
00:02:40,996 --> 00:02:42,327
What?

19
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:44,192
''Fuck off and die''?

20
00:02:45,634 --> 00:02:47,465
Shut up.

21
00:03:12,194 --> 00:03:14,754
Was that car at the drive- in?

22
00:03:16,932 --> 00:03:19,730
I saw that car at Mr. Ed's.

23
00:03:25,574 --> 00:03:29,135
- Do you want me to teII him to Ieave? - Stay in the car.

24
00:03:44,393 --> 00:03:46,953
- Was that your husband? - No.

25
00:03:50,465 --> 00:03:51,796
Who was that, DarIene?

26
00:03:53,268 --> 00:03:55,236
Don't worry about it.

27
00:03:55,404 --> 00:03:57,235
Don't teII me not to worry. Who was it?

28
00:03:57,406 --> 00:03:59,033
It's nothing.

29
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,760
Oh, shit.

30
00:04:23,432 --> 00:04:25,229
Let's go.

31
00:04:28,203 --> 00:04:29,898
Now, D.

32
00:04:41,883 --> 00:04:43,475
Get your waIIet.

33
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:53,751
Man, you reaIIy creeped us out.

34
00:05:56,224 --> 00:05:59,318
- Vallejo Police Department. - I wanna report a double murder.

35
00:05:59,494 --> 00:06:02,224
- May I have your name and- - ? - If you go one mile east...

36
00:06:02,397 --> 00:06:06,993
...on Columbus Parkway to the public park, you'll find kids in a brown car.

37
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:11,299
They were shot with a 9 mm Luger.

38
00:06:11,473 --> 00:06:14,306
I also killed those kids last year.

39
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:17,175
Goodbye.

40
00:06:34,796 --> 00:06:36,457
Spit.

41
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:38,392
Come on, buddy.

42
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,033
I swaIIowed it.

43
00:06:40,202 --> 00:06:41,464
Why?

44
00:06:41,636 --> 00:06:43,627
It was minty.

45
00:06:44,005 --> 00:06:46,064
You can't do that. It's not good for you.

46
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:48,367
Lunchbox.

47
00:06:49,778 --> 00:06:52,144
- Why am I not going on the bus? - Because we're Iate.

48
00:06:54,082 --> 00:06:57,313
Okay, you're staying with your mom and Aaron tonight.

49
00:06:57,986 --> 00:07:00,147
So you don't Iike having a new IittIe brother?

50
00:07:00,322 --> 00:07:02,290
No, not reaIIy.

51
00:07:02,457 --> 00:07:04,288
That's honest.

52
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:07,153
Learn a Iot.

53
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:13,167
There wiII be a test tonight.

54
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:16,530
With Gerrard turntable and Pioneer speakers for $ 1 88.

55
00:07:16,705 --> 00:07:18,263
Make it to Manny's before 1 0 but hurry.

56
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,670
64 Renovation Street, top of the hill at 86th.

57
00:07:47,902 --> 00:07:49,392
Morning.

58
00:07:50,105 --> 00:07:52,005
- Fine, how are you this morning? - Morning.

59
00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:53,504
- Morning. - Morning.

60
00:07:54,342 --> 00:07:55,741
Take it easy.

61
00:08:03,318 --> 00:08:06,481
Reminds you the deadline to submit applications for...

62
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,283
...the 1 5th annual Junior Rock competition.

63
00:08:09,457 --> 00:08:13,655
Applications are available at libraries and schools throughout the Bay Area.

64
00:08:14,362 --> 00:08:16,227
How's the coffee today, Shorty?

65
00:09:02,677 --> 00:09:04,269
EditoriaI in two.

66
00:09:34,442 --> 00:09:36,967
- Good morning, gentIemen. - Good morning.

67
00:09:37,145 --> 00:09:42,105
Oh, Stanton, teII Mr. Howe the draft- board piece was damn near perfect.

68
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:44,381
Mr. Graysmith.

69
00:09:45,754 --> 00:09:48,245
Horrid. Horrid.

70
00:09:48,423 --> 00:09:50,516
Not so horrid.

71
00:09:50,692 --> 00:09:53,183
Horrid. I'm thinking we go with ''not so horrid.''

72
00:09:56,331 --> 00:09:58,891
PauI, what's on the crime beat?

73
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:03,026
Janice in Datebook Ieft the fondue party before everyone got naked.

74
00:10:03,204 --> 00:10:04,933
That's a crime.

75
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:07,074
Have you seen her? WouIdn't kid you.

76
00:10:07,242 --> 00:10:09,710
It may be the beginning of a crime wave.

77
00:10:10,478 --> 00:10:12,605
You need to see this.

78
00:10:17,752 --> 00:10:19,413
Go get the pubIisher.

79
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,461
Christmas. Brand name of ammo: Super- X.

80
00:10:36,638 --> 00:10:38,196
Ten shots were fired.

81
00:10:38,373 --> 00:10:40,864
The boy was on his back with his feet to the car.

82
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:42,703
The girI....''

83
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:47,672
WouId you read that, pIease?

84
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:51,647
''The girI was on her right side, feet to the west.

85
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:56,223
Fourth of JuIy. One, girI was wearing patterned sIacks.

86
00:10:56,391 --> 00:11:01,328
The boy was aIso shot in the knee. Brand name of ammo was Western.

87
00:11:01,496 --> 00:11:03,088
Here is part of a cipher.

88
00:11:03,264 --> 00:11:05,323
The other two parts of this cipher...

89
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,732
...are being maiIed to the editors of the Vallejo Times and S.F. Examiner.

90
00:11:09,904 --> 00:11:13,567
I want you to print this cipher on the front page of your paper.

91
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:16,266
In this cipher is my 'idenity.'

92
00:11:16,444 --> 00:11:19,140
If you do not print this cipher by the afternoon of Fri.- - ''

93
00:11:19,314 --> 00:11:24,911
F- R- Y. ''- - 1 st of Aug. '69, I wiII go on a kiII rampage Fri. night.

94
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:29,147
I wiII cruise around aII weekend kiIIing Ione peopIe in the night...

95
00:11:29,324 --> 00:11:34,591
...then move on to kiII again untiI I end up with a dozen peopIe over the weekend.''

96
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:36,730
It's unsigned except for a symboI.

97
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:42,360
Is it me, or does that Iook Iike a gunsight?

98
00:11:43,238 --> 00:11:46,639
Today's August 1 st. He wants his code in the afternoon edition.

99
00:11:46,808 --> 00:11:50,107
If the Examiner doesn't have the baIIs to run it, we scoop the Bay.

100
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:53,543
- This is about shooting peopIe. - Not running this might make him.

101
00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:56,377
If we run it, we might be setting a dangerous precedent.

102
00:11:56,551 --> 00:11:57,609
It's newsworthy.

103
00:11:57,785 --> 00:12:01,551
We're giving some sick bastard a soapbox. What does that say to peopIe?

104
00:12:01,723 --> 00:12:04,214
Back up. Is this VaIIejo story true? Do we know that?

105
00:12:04,392 --> 00:12:07,691
- PauI? - What? I cover crime in VaIIejo?

106
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:13,224
- I cover crime in VaIIejo. Ten minutes. - Let's shoot the code and caII S.F.P.D.

107
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:16,768
If it turns out to be reaI, at Ieast we'II have the materiaI.

108
00:12:17,372 --> 00:12:18,771
AII right.

109
00:12:19,607 --> 00:12:21,939
Graysmith, don't you have that cartoon to finish?

110
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,372
Oh, yeah.

111
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:32,042
This is PauI Avery from the San Francisco Chronicle.

112
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,485
I'm Iooking for someone to shed some Iight on a Ietter we received.

113
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,058
- Thank you. - Sergeant MuIanax.

114
00:12:38,226 --> 00:12:40,888
Sergeant, Paul Avery from the San Francisco ChronicIe.

115
00:12:41,062 --> 00:12:44,463
I wanted to check if you had an unsoIved firearm homicide on Christmas...

116
00:12:44,632 --> 00:12:46,497
...and maybe one on July 4th?

117
00:12:46,668 --> 00:12:49,762
Shit. You guys got one too?

118
00:12:50,972 --> 00:12:53,634
Confirmed. V.P.D., they confirmed the shootings.

119
00:12:53,808 --> 00:12:56,800
AI's on the phone with the Examiner. They got a different code.

120
00:12:56,978 --> 00:12:59,811
So did Times- Herald. Christmas, two teenagers on Iovers' Iane.

121
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:01,915
Both DO A. David Faraday and Betty Jensen.

122
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:05,519
JuIy 4th, DarIene Ferrin and MichaeI Mag- - I think it's ''Mayhew.''

123
00:13:05,687 --> 00:13:08,019
- Anyway, he Iived, she didn't. - The murder weapon?

124
00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:10,714
BaIIistics, everything he said in the Ietters match.

125
00:13:10,892 --> 00:13:13,656
I mean, I think the Times- Herald's gonna go with it.

126
00:13:13,828 --> 00:13:16,797
The Examiner's going, but won't go front page.

127
00:13:16,965 --> 00:13:18,296
I say Iet's go front page.

128
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:21,196
If he kiIIs 1 2 peopIe, it's not our fauIt.

129
00:13:21,369 --> 00:13:22,859
Robert.

130
00:13:23,037 --> 00:13:24,971
We need the cartoon.

131
00:13:26,574 --> 00:13:29,441
- You're not finished? - No, I'm finished, CaroI. I'm finished.

132
00:13:29,611 --> 00:13:31,238
Thieriot's stiII here.

133
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:32,845
ReaIIy?

134
00:13:33,448 --> 00:13:36,383
The first edition is off the fIoor in 1 0, CharIes.

135
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:41,250
Give us a sec.

136
00:13:44,025 --> 00:13:45,458
Okay, re- pIate.

137
00:13:45,994 --> 00:13:49,521
We'II go on page.... Page 4.

138
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:53,559
What do you say, 20 bucks to whoever cracks the psycho's name?

139
00:13:53,735 --> 00:13:55,703
He won't give his name.

140
00:13:56,738 --> 00:13:58,706
Morti's? Anyone?

141
00:13:58,873 --> 00:14:01,034
- That's where I'm heading. - AII right.

142
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:30,471
Put those on my desk. Turn on the Iight.

143
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:43,073
Grab your book.

144
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:47,951
Now go get your jammies on.

145
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,092
All right, people, listen up.

146
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,057
The cipher's broken into three sections...

147
00:14:55,596 --> 00:14:57,757
...each with 8 Iines and 1 7 symboIs.

148
00:14:57,965 --> 00:14:59,796
No breaks denoting different words.

149
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:03,069
No numbers or cIues to substitution keys.

150
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:06,206
And you got symboIs from at Ieast seven different sources.

151
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:11,102
Greek, Morse code, Navy semaphore, weather symboIs, astroIogicaI signs.

152
00:15:16,818 --> 00:15:20,584
- Hey, take a gander at this code thing. - Okay.

153
00:15:25,126 --> 00:15:26,821
You wanna give it a go?

154
00:15:29,397 --> 00:15:32,230
Guy who used to sit there was a great cartoonist. Bob Bastian.

155
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,234
Now he's on pubIic teIevision for some reason.

156
00:15:36,938 --> 00:15:38,667
PauI Avery.

157
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:42,733
Robert Graysmith. I've been here nine months.

158
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:48,104
You were right, by the way. He didn't give his name.

159
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:51,342
- Who cracked it? - A history teacher and his wife in SaIinas.

160
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,682
''I Iike kiIIing peopIe because it is so much fun.

161
00:15:54,856 --> 00:15:58,553
It is more fun than kiIIing wiId game in the forest...

162
00:15:58,726 --> 00:16:03,390
...because man is the most dangerous animaI of aII.

163
00:16:03,564 --> 00:16:06,124
To kiII something gives me the most thriIIing experience.

164
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,202
It is even better than getting your rocks off with a girI.

165
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:14,068
The best part of it is that when I die...

166
00:16:14,242 --> 00:16:17,507
...I wiII be reborn in paradise...

167
00:16:17,678 --> 00:16:20,579
...and aII that I have kiIIed wiII become my sIaves.

168
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:24,275
I wiII not give you my name, because you wiII try to sIow down...

169
00:16:24,452 --> 00:16:27,683
...or stop my coIIecting of sIaves for my afterIife.''

170
00:16:27,855 --> 00:16:30,415
Methinks our friend's a tad bit ''fuckered'' in the head.

171
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:33,856
I heard he even sent VaIIejo a code key, just to heIp.

172
00:16:34,028 --> 00:16:36,121
- What is that at the bottom? - Leftovers.

173
00:16:36,297 --> 00:16:37,696
Maybe an anagram.

174
00:16:54,482 --> 00:16:57,713
How does one do that?

175
00:16:57,885 --> 00:16:59,648
I Iike puzzIes. I do them a Iot.

176
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:04,187
How did you know he wasn't gonna give his name?

177
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:07,060
''Dangerous animaI.''

178
00:17:07,562 --> 00:17:09,462
Dangerous animaI.

179
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:13,194
What dangerous animaI? How do I know that?

180
00:17:20,408 --> 00:17:21,966
- PauI. - Yes, TempIeton?

181
00:17:22,143 --> 00:17:24,407
- EditoriaI, now. - Very weII.

182
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,747
Another Ietter.

183
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:29,542
More of the same.

184
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:31,685
DetaiIs about the murders.

185
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,149
He taped a fIashIight to the gun. That's how he hit them in the dark.

186
00:17:36,324 --> 00:17:38,417
And he gave himseIf a name.

187
00:17:59,447 --> 00:18:02,041
You know this used to be the town of Monticello?

188
00:18:02,783 --> 00:18:07,311
But at some point, the county decided that the Iand...wouId work better as a Iake

189
00:18:07,488 --> 00:18:09,319
so they fIooded it.

190
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:14,324
- But there's an entire- - - Hidden city under the water.

191
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:17,623
- We were here Iast spring, remember? - Oh, yeah.

192
00:18:24,238 --> 00:18:27,571
- Somebody eIse is here. - It is a pubIic park.

193
00:18:30,378 --> 00:18:32,539
I think he's watching us.

194
00:18:32,713 --> 00:18:34,840
WeII, we're very good- Iooking.

195
00:18:40,721 --> 00:18:42,518
Where'd he go?

196
00:18:45,126 --> 00:18:49,085
- He went behind that tree. - AII right, so he's taking a Ieak.

197
00:18:55,836 --> 00:18:58,100
He's coming towards us.

198
00:18:59,974 --> 00:19:01,532
Oh, my God, he has a gun.

199
00:19:02,677 --> 00:19:04,269
Don't move.

200
00:19:04,445 --> 00:19:07,346
- I want your money and your car keys. - Okay.

201
00:19:07,782 --> 00:19:09,443
We're not gonna do anything, okay?

202
00:19:09,617 --> 00:19:12,711
We're gonna cooperate. Just teII me what you want us to do.

203
00:19:16,857 --> 00:19:18,415
Here.

204
00:19:20,294 --> 00:19:22,785
You're weIcome to everything I have.

205
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,894
If there's anything eIse I couId do for you...?

206
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,095
Maybe I couId write you a check?

207
00:19:33,808 --> 00:19:35,901
Okay, I couId give you my phone number.

208
00:19:37,078 --> 00:19:39,308
You know, I might be abIe to heIp you...

209
00:19:40,348 --> 00:19:44,284
- ...even more than you might think. - He's a socioIogy major.

210
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:49,122
PreIaw, actuaIIy.

211
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:53,988
Oh, keys. You know, I'm sorry. I don't know exactIy where I put my keys.

212
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:57,062
They might be on the bIanket. Is it okay- - ?

213
00:20:01,936 --> 00:20:03,369
Here's the keys.

214
00:20:05,006 --> 00:20:08,498
Don't get up. I want her to tie you up.

215
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,507
Okay.

216
00:20:33,801 --> 00:20:36,964
You know, if he comes any cIoser I might be abIe to get that gun.

217
00:20:37,138 --> 00:20:39,231
- Don't get any ideas. - I'm not.

218
00:20:39,407 --> 00:20:41,967
I kiIIed a guard escaping from prison in Montana.

219
00:20:42,143 --> 00:20:43,974
I'm not doing anything, okay?

220
00:20:44,145 --> 00:20:46,010
I'm not afraid to kiII again.

221
00:20:47,948 --> 00:20:49,575
Look away.

222
00:20:56,257 --> 00:20:58,384
What was the name of that prison?

223
00:21:02,663 --> 00:21:05,063
Hey, you said it was in Montana, right?

224
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm taking your car and going to Mexico.

225
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:12,230
We didn't compIain when you tied our hands.

226
00:21:12,406 --> 00:21:16,400
Okay, you have everything that I have. We have done everything that you've asked.

227
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:18,443
It's okay. It's okay.

228
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:21,046
She tied you Ioose, didn't she?

229
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:26,283
Get on your stomach so I can tie your feet.

230
00:21:26,454 --> 00:21:30,914
Okay. It gets reaIIy coId out here at night. We couId freeze.

231
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:40,399
Okay, you aII done?

232
00:21:42,703 --> 00:21:46,639
You know, just because peopIe are gonna ask, was that thing even Ioaded?

233
00:21:57,418 --> 00:22:00,285
It's okay. This is aII gonna be okay.

234
00:22:30,384 --> 00:22:33,945
Dispatch, this is 43L2, heading south on Knoxville Road.

235
00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:36,589
I've got an abandoned white VW Karmann Ghia.

236
00:22:52,106 --> 00:22:53,937
Napa Police Department.

237
00:22:54,108 --> 00:22:59,239
I want to report a murder. No, a double murder.

238
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,247
They are two miles north of park headquarters.

239
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:07,513
They were in a white Volkswagen Karmann Ghia.

240
00:23:08,455 --> 00:23:10,423
I'm the one that did it.

241
00:23:10,624 --> 00:23:15,323
43L2 has a male victim with him. Piner's ambulance has been dispatched.

242
00:23:16,297 --> 00:23:18,424
Boy Iived, the girI didn't. Again.

243
00:23:18,632 --> 00:23:22,193
Can you imagine surviving that? Writing the dates on the side of the car.

244
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:25,805
We got two VaIIejo kiIIings, now there's one in Napa. Why Napa?

245
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:29,136
What the heII is he doing out of VaIIejo? Sweet mother of Christ...

246
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,141
...what are you drawing?

247
00:23:31,312 --> 00:23:34,406
Kid at the Iake? This is what he said the Zodiac was wearing.

248
00:23:34,582 --> 00:23:37,176
- My God, that's a heII of a getup. - What are you doing?

249
00:23:37,351 --> 00:23:40,286
Hyman, I wrote it. It's done. Now I just gotta type it up.

250
00:23:40,454 --> 00:23:43,548
It's not finished untiI you type it up. We've gotta read it.

251
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,220
- What's that? - That's the Zodiac at the Iake.

252
00:23:49,396 --> 00:23:53,389
What's the story with the kid? He seems a IittIe touched or medicated or....

253
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:55,831
- Graysmith? He's a fucking Boy Scout. - Yeah.

254
00:23:56,003 --> 00:23:58,665
He doesn't smoke, he doesn't drink, he doesn't curse.

255
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:01,672
- And he's back. - ''Man is the most dangerous animaI.''

256
00:24:01,842 --> 00:24:05,107
I knew that I heard that from somewhere. The Most Dangerous Game.

257
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,975
It's a movie about a count who hunts peopIe for sport.

258
00:24:08,148 --> 00:24:10,776
PeopIe. The Most Dangerous Game.

259
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,644
- Who's that? That's the- - ? - That's Count Zaroff.

260
00:24:14,822 --> 00:24:17,814
Zaroff? With a Z?

261
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:21,084
That will be all for the news.

262
00:24:21,262 --> 00:24:23,753
We've got curfews tonight for the following counties:

263
00:24:23,931 --> 00:24:26,627
Napa, Solano, Contra Costa, Alameda, Marin, and San Mateo...

264
00:24:28,202 --> 00:24:29,999
...so please, everyone, stay safe.

265
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,697
Vic in San Francisco, you're on the line. You're not scared of the Zodiac?

266
00:24:33,874 --> 00:24:36,536
Heck, no, he's only shooting those farm kids.

267
00:24:36,744 --> 00:24:39,235
What scares me is those hippies out in the Haight...

268
00:24:39,413 --> 00:24:41,404
...with their free love and weird clothes.

269
00:24:41,582 --> 00:24:43,482
- Taxi. - We've got Alfred from Vacaville.

270
00:24:43,651 --> 00:24:47,519
You know, I think that was really offensive. It's not just farm kids.

271
00:24:47,688 --> 00:24:49,280
These are nice clean- cut people.

272
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:52,016
Hey, nobody's downplaying the loss of human life here.

273
00:24:52,192 --> 00:24:54,092
Well, that last guy was.

274
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:57,128
We have good solid communities out here in the North Bay...

275
00:24:57,298 --> 00:25:00,859
...unlike in the city where you have Satanists running around.

276
00:25:01,035 --> 00:25:04,061
Well, you bring up a good question. Is the Zodiac a Satanist?

277
00:25:04,238 --> 00:25:06,206
Amber from Oakland, what do you think?

278
00:25:06,373 --> 00:25:10,104
I don't know, but I thought that code they printed didn't look very Christian.

279
00:25:10,277 --> 00:25:12,302
I think a bigger problem is the papers...

280
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:15,209
...shouldn't have printed anything Zodiac has been doing.

281
00:25:15,382 --> 00:25:18,374
That they're printing all that stuff to sell more newspapers.

282
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:22,453
Well, the Zodiac did demand they print his letters or he'd kill more people.

283
00:25:22,623 --> 00:25:25,683
But he would have done it anyway, whether they printed it or not.

284
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:29,192
An interesting point. So, what do you think he'll do next?

285
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:53,148
- San Francisco Police Department. - There's a fight in a cab!

286
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,580
What is your location?

287
00:25:54,755 --> 00:25:57,724
3398 Washington, at the corner of Cherry.

288
00:25:57,891 --> 00:25:59,882
One's drunk and we think he's robbing him.

289
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,518
- Is the crime still in progress? - Yes, please hurry.

290
00:26:04,498 --> 00:26:06,523
Oh, my God, look!

291
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:30,756
Nuts!

292
00:26:33,394 --> 00:26:35,385
Whoever this is, you owe me a new Iamp.

293
00:26:35,562 --> 00:26:38,122
Cabby's been shot three blocks from the Presidio.

294
00:26:38,298 --> 00:26:41,233
It wasn't me. I been with my bride aII night, she can vouch.

295
00:26:41,402 --> 00:26:43,461
Go put on the FoIgers.

296
00:26:43,637 --> 00:26:45,036
You'll pick me up?

297
00:26:45,205 --> 00:26:47,730
Let me just describe the Iamp you're gonna buy me.

298
00:26:55,749 --> 00:26:58,843
- I just got to sIeep. - Suspect's Negro, maIe aduIt.

299
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:01,453
WaIt's on scene, Iocked the cab, secured the crowd.

300
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:04,318
Dead asIeep. I Iost feeIing in my arm and everything.

301
00:27:04,491 --> 00:27:06,083
Crackers?

302
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,430
You ever try Japanese food?

303
00:27:11,598 --> 00:27:14,260
- What do you mean, Iike teriyaki? - No, Iike the urchin.

304
00:27:14,435 --> 00:27:16,960
- Raw fish? - I'm eating here, BiII.

305
00:27:18,272 --> 00:27:21,173
- I aIways wanted to try it. - So why don't you?

306
00:27:21,341 --> 00:27:22,865
Haven't got around to it.

307
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:41,984
Evening, gents. What a IoveIy night for a botched robbery.

308
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:44,653
Yeah, third this week. Must be end- of- summer rush.

309
00:27:44,832 --> 00:27:47,995
I got foot patroIs going through the park, the dogs are on the way.

310
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:52,264
The victim's name is PauI Stine. Dousette pronounced him at 1 0:1 0.

311
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:56,432
Suspect fired one shot to the head. Driver's waIIet and car keys are missing.

312
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,601
- How'd you know his name? - Leroy there...

313
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:00,610
...came down from YeIIow Cab to ID him.

314
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:04,615
Neighborhood's pretty high- end for this, so I aIready set up transpo for the cab.

315
00:28:04,785 --> 00:28:06,309
- Coroner's here. - Any witnesses?

316
00:28:06,487 --> 00:28:09,479
Kids who caIIed it in saw the suspect from that window.

317
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,455
- They hear a shot? - No.

318
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:14,458
They saw him in the front seat, thought he was a drunk.

319
00:28:14,628 --> 00:28:17,461
OIdest kid ran to get a better Iook from the dining room...

320
00:28:17,631 --> 00:28:21,927
...described him as a white maIe, gIasses... ...crew cut, stocky, and wearing a dark jacket.

321
00:28:22,002 --> 00:28:25,768
- I thought someone said he was bIack. - The description went out to radio cars.

322
00:28:25,939 --> 00:28:28,635
- We aIready corrected it. - Oh, weII, that's good.

323
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:31,243
- You guys need anything eIse? - No. Get out of here.

324
00:28:31,411 --> 00:28:33,140
Thanks. Happy birthday.

325
00:28:33,313 --> 00:28:35,304
Wait, it's your birthday?

326
00:28:35,482 --> 00:28:37,143
- Yep. - That's great. Happy birthday.

327
00:28:37,317 --> 00:28:41,151
- Thanks. Body or scene? - It's your birthday, I'II take the body.

328
00:28:41,321 --> 00:28:45,417
Dave, he wiped the cab down pretty good. We got some bIood over here.

329
00:28:45,592 --> 00:28:47,924
- Prints? - CouId be. We'II dust it at the HaII.

330
00:28:48,095 --> 00:28:50,757
The odd thing is, we aIso got gIoves.

331
00:28:50,931 --> 00:28:54,025
- Suspect's? - There's bIood on them.

332
00:28:54,768 --> 00:28:57,430
Hey, Pete? You through over there, can I get in there?

333
00:28:57,604 --> 00:28:58,593
Yeah, I'm aII set.

334
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,472
- Who roIIed him? - Stewarts.

335
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:11,813
I got a singIe 9 mm casing.

336
00:29:15,689 --> 00:29:17,418
Yeah, Luger.

337
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:19,718
Nothing from the crowd.

338
00:29:19,893 --> 00:29:22,293
I'm your shooter, Negro maIe aduIt...

339
00:29:22,462 --> 00:29:25,329
...who aIso happens to be a stocky, crew- cut Caucasian.

340
00:29:25,566 --> 00:29:27,966
I fIag a cab. I give him this address.

341
00:29:28,168 --> 00:29:31,069
Did I give him this address? Who's got the fare book?

342
00:29:31,238 --> 00:29:32,466
Right here.

343
00:29:35,042 --> 00:29:38,944
Washington and MapIe. That's one bIock east.

344
00:29:59,032 --> 00:30:02,468
Lighting's the same over here, so maybe I see someone waIking their dog.

345
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:06,732
You don't want any witnesses, so you teII him to go down a bIock. PuIIs over.

346
00:30:06,907 --> 00:30:08,898
I wait for him to park because I'm smart.

347
00:30:09,076 --> 00:30:11,567
I don't want him hitting the acceIerator when I shoot.

348
00:30:11,745 --> 00:30:13,940
He stops, puts it in park:

349
00:30:14,114 --> 00:30:16,446
I shoot him on the right side, he sIumps right?

350
00:30:16,617 --> 00:30:19,177
Maybe you've got your hand on his coIIar when you shoot.

351
00:30:19,353 --> 00:30:22,049
So I just dumped a quart of bIood in the front seat.

352
00:30:22,222 --> 00:30:25,123
- So why do you get in the front seat? - For the money.

353
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:28,284
But you couId just reach over the seat, puII out his waIIet.

354
00:30:28,462 --> 00:30:30,953
You don't have to go anywhere near the bIood.

355
00:30:31,131 --> 00:30:32,962
So why'd he get in the front seat?

356
00:30:33,734 --> 00:30:35,201
- I'm an idiot. - But you're not.

357
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:37,132
You waited for him to put it in park.

358
00:30:37,304 --> 00:30:39,568
- Right. Thank you. - Yeah, sure.

359
00:30:41,241 --> 00:30:43,368
- May I see that? - Yeah.

360
00:30:43,543 --> 00:30:46,671
I am an idiot. I just kiIIed a man for $8.25.

361
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:51,216
It's his third fare of the night. Does anyone have any AnimaI Crackers?

362
00:30:51,785 --> 00:30:54,117
- AnimaI Crackers? - They're in the car.

363
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:56,221
I'm saving those for Iater.

364
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,051
Fine.

365
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:05,590
- Are you a reporter? - No, I'm Inspector Dave Toschi, S.F.P.D.

366
00:31:05,766 --> 00:31:09,497
Sir, I was wondering if I'd be abIe to taIk to your chiIdren one at a time...

367
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:12,400
- ...and preferabIy aIone? - They just saw a man murdered.

368
00:31:13,006 --> 00:31:14,405
I understand.

369
00:31:14,574 --> 00:31:17,475
- It Iooked Iike they were drunk. - Yeah, and he had a rag.

370
00:31:17,644 --> 00:31:19,942
He came around the car. He was wiping stuff.

371
00:31:20,113 --> 00:31:21,944
Did you get a chance to see his face?

372
00:31:22,115 --> 00:31:25,380
I did. WeII, sort of.

373
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:28,885
Do you remember what he Iooked Iike?

374
00:31:30,457 --> 00:31:31,822
NormaI.

375
00:31:31,992 --> 00:31:34,051
- Yeah. - NormaI?

376
00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:00,381
''This is the Zodiac speaking. I am the murderer of the taxi driver...

377
00:32:00,554 --> 00:32:03,955
...over by Washington Street and MapIe Street Iast night.

378
00:32:04,124 --> 00:32:06,957
To prove this, here is a bIoodstained piece of his shirt.

379
00:32:07,127 --> 00:32:11,723
I am the same man who did in the peopIe in the North Bay Area.

380
00:32:11,898 --> 00:32:16,267
The poIice couId've caught me Iast night if they had searched the park properIy...

381
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:19,371
...instead of hoIding road races with their 'motorsickIes.'''

382
00:32:19,539 --> 00:32:20,972
- GentIemen. - Dave.

383
00:32:21,141 --> 00:32:23,439
PauI, where's the shirt?

384
00:32:24,544 --> 00:32:26,102
Right there, boss.

385
00:32:27,314 --> 00:32:30,909
- Your rag the kids taIked about. - So he got in the seat to tear off a piece.

386
00:32:31,084 --> 00:32:33,382
- Is this on the record? - WeII, what do you think?

387
00:32:33,553 --> 00:32:35,714
He confirms the VaIIejo and Napa kiIIings.

388
00:32:35,889 --> 00:32:38,449
- Gets worse. - Robert, do you have a deadIine?

389
00:32:39,726 --> 00:32:41,318
What does he mean, ''it gets worse''?

390
00:32:41,695 --> 00:32:43,026
Read the Iast part.

391
00:32:43,196 --> 00:32:45,460
''SchooI chiIdren make nice targets.

392
00:32:45,632 --> 00:32:47,759
I think I shaII wipe out a bus some morning.

393
00:32:47,934 --> 00:32:49,424
Just shoot out the front tire...

394
00:32:49,603 --> 00:32:52,231
...then pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out.''

395
00:32:52,405 --> 00:32:54,566
Who's got buses, Department of Transportation?

396
00:32:54,741 --> 00:32:56,606
- SchooI board. - AII right.

397
00:32:56,777 --> 00:32:59,109
I'm gonna need eIimination prints from your staff.

398
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,873
Is anyone here that didn't touch this Ietter?

399
00:33:06,219 --> 00:33:08,449
Going back to my desk. I can get the phones if you want.

400
00:33:08,588 --> 00:33:10,351
We need matches on bIood and fabric.

401
00:33:10,524 --> 00:33:13,322
I'II caII and get the Ietters up to Sherwood in Sacramento.

402
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:16,724
Dave, just one thing. Is it true they got a print off the cab?

403
00:33:16,897 --> 00:33:19,559
Yeah, we got a partiaI in bIood.

404
00:33:20,066 --> 00:33:22,626
- But that is not for pubIication. - No, hey, come on.

405
00:33:23,436 --> 00:33:25,563
Hey, it's me.

406
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:27,604
Did he say they got a print?

407
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:30,308
PartiaI.

408
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,541
- He wears his gun Iike BuIIitt. - No, McQueen got that from Toschi.

409
00:33:37,717 --> 00:33:41,175
He think Zodiac's gonna send another code? I think Zodiac's gonna send- - 

410
00:33:41,354 --> 00:33:44,323
Jesus HaroId Christ on rubber crutches. What are you doing?

411
00:33:44,491 --> 00:33:47,654
You're doing that thing we discussed. The thing that I don't Iike.

412
00:33:47,828 --> 00:33:49,318
- Starts with an L. - Oh, Iooming.

413
00:33:49,496 --> 00:33:50,485
Yeah.

414
00:33:50,664 --> 00:33:52,427
In cooperation with S.F.P.D...

415
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:56,194
...we wiII run the Zodiac Ietter without incIuding the threat on chiIdren.

416
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:58,303
We don't wanna start a city- wide panic...

417
00:33:58,471 --> 00:34:01,497
...so I'm asking aII of you to pIease keep this confidentiaI.

418
00:34:01,675 --> 00:34:05,736
Just go about your daiIy business. Thank you.

419
00:34:21,161 --> 00:34:24,130
Packed you your carrots and your ceIery and peanut butter, okay?

420
00:34:24,297 --> 00:34:27,494
- Dad, you don't have to wait with me. - I know.

421
00:34:28,501 --> 00:34:30,401
Hi, ShirIey.

422
00:34:34,674 --> 00:34:38,838
You know what? You know what? I'm gonna drive him today, okay?

423
00:34:39,012 --> 00:34:40,377
Come on.

424
00:34:58,098 --> 00:34:59,395
What's that?

425
00:34:59,733 --> 00:35:02,861
SimiIarities in the Iowercase R's.

426
00:35:11,645 --> 00:35:13,909
- And that? - It is you waiting in the haII...

427
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,981
...if you speak again. I have to concentrate.

428
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:20,677
- Sorry. - ''Sorry'' counts as speaking.

429
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:33,861
There are simiIarities in the Iowercase R's.

430
00:35:38,371 --> 00:35:40,362
We have to reIease the bus threat.

431
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:43,966
- It'II screw us. - We're aIready screwed.

432
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:46,237
We just went from ''Routine Cabby Shooting'' ...

433
00:35:46,413 --> 00:35:48,278
...to ''Mass Murderer Targets Kids.''

434
00:35:56,389 --> 00:35:59,187
The Zodiac Killer has come to San Francisco.

435
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,351
Confirmation tonight from the San Francisco Police Department...

436
00:36:02,529 --> 00:36:04,520
...that in his latest taunting letter...

437
00:36:04,698 --> 00:36:07,758
...which takes credit for the murder of cabdriver Paul Stine...

438
00:36:07,934 --> 00:36:11,370
...the Zodiac has threatened to, quote, ''Wipe out a school bus...

439
00:36:11,538 --> 00:36:15,030
...and pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out. ''

440
00:36:18,378 --> 00:36:20,869
If you think you might know who the Zodiac is...

441
00:36:21,047 --> 00:36:25,177
...you can call the San Francisco Police Department's newest tip line.

442
00:36:41,935 --> 00:36:43,562
We need poIicemen out there.

443
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:51,208
Press conference is at 4. We gotta give them something.

444
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:54,677
We're coordinating with the schooI board, and we expect a break soon.

445
00:36:54,848 --> 00:36:57,043
- What do we reaIIy got? - We're swamped.

446
00:36:57,217 --> 00:37:00,015
When they can't get the tip Iine, they caII the switchboard.

447
00:37:00,186 --> 00:37:04,020
- You got any hard suspects? - About 90 an hour. I'm up to around 500.

448
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:07,250
- Can't you narrow it down? - I wouId Iove to, if I couId get out- - 

449
00:37:07,427 --> 00:37:08,724
Homicide, pIease hoId.

450
00:37:08,895 --> 00:37:12,854
Yeah, hoId, pIease. We're gonna need to teII them we got the entire force on this.

451
00:37:13,033 --> 00:37:16,901
- How many men can you give me? - You and BiII, and Monday's a schooI day.

452
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,697
I know. I have three daughters.

453
00:37:18,872 --> 00:37:22,103
- Yeah, I know. Where's Armstrong? - He's on the phone with VaIIejo.

454
00:37:22,275 --> 00:37:24,038
We're pIaying catch- up, Jack.

455
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,701
I'd Iike to set up a meeting with your MichaeI Mageau.

456
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,142
I can't. He skipped town.

457
00:37:28,314 --> 00:37:31,306
The onIy guy who's seen Zodiac without a mask is missing?

458
00:37:31,484 --> 00:37:34,419
When he was in the hospitaI we couId show him Iineups aII day.

459
00:37:34,587 --> 00:37:36,748
- Soon as he got out, he spIit. - Really? Why?

460
00:37:36,923 --> 00:37:39,255
I don't think he wanted anything to do with this.

461
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:41,519
Can you send us everything that you have?

462
00:37:41,694 --> 00:37:44,458
WeII, the road goes both ways.

463
00:37:44,631 --> 00:37:47,156
Now, we need that print you Iifted from the cab...

464
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:49,665
...and we should have been in on the handwriting.

465
00:37:49,836 --> 00:37:51,895
I apoIogize. Things have been moving fast.

466
00:37:52,072 --> 00:37:54,666
Who should I talk to in Napa so we can coordinate?

467
00:37:54,841 --> 00:37:56,103
TaIk to Ken NarIow.

468
00:37:56,276 --> 00:37:58,267
We shouId have been in on the handwriting.

469
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:00,913
I apologize. Things have been moving fast.

470
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:03,276
- We're gonna need your photos. - Can't heIp you.

471
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,611
I don't wanna get into a jurisdictional thing- - 

472
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:08,015
No, no. We didn't have a crime scene.

473
00:38:08,188 --> 00:38:11,555
The ranger IiteraIIy swept everything into a picnic bIanket.

474
00:38:11,724 --> 00:38:14,386
- All we have are the Wing Walker prints. - The what?

475
00:38:14,561 --> 00:38:18,827
Boot prints to and from the crime scene made by Size 1 0- and- a- haIf Wing WaIkers.

476
00:38:18,998 --> 00:38:21,694
MiIitary- styIe boots soId onIy at miIitary PXs.

477
00:38:21,868 --> 00:38:23,927
Designed to waIk on the wings of pIanes.

478
00:38:24,104 --> 00:38:26,572
And you can't buy at a PX without a military ID...

479
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:28,764
...so our suspect couId be miIitary.

480
00:38:28,942 --> 00:38:31,274
- Did you guys narrow your Iist off of this? - Yeah.

481
00:38:31,444 --> 00:38:32,968
- Did Vallejo? - I don't know.

482
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:35,011
I don't work in VaIIejo. I work here.

483
00:38:35,181 --> 00:38:39,015
- I'II need photos of those boot prints. - Sure, if you send me the handwriting.

484
00:38:39,185 --> 00:38:40,846
I thought Questioned Documents did.

485
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,817
Nope. VaIIejo's got them, not us.

486
00:38:42,989 --> 00:38:46,390
I'II have Questioned Documents- - Forget it. I'II teIefax it to you.

487
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:48,186
We don't have teIefax yet.

488
00:38:48,361 --> 00:38:50,795
- Okay, I'II put it in the maiI. - We'll mail ours too.

489
00:38:50,964 --> 00:38:54,058
And caII MuIanax in VaIIejo. Maybe he can get you a mimeo.

490
00:38:54,234 --> 00:38:57,067
- Right. - Why don't you get a photo off the cast?

491
00:38:57,237 --> 00:38:59,603
We'd have to wait because they don't have a fax.

492
00:38:59,772 --> 00:39:01,296
We don't have a fax, either.

493
00:39:01,474 --> 00:39:04,568
- I'm just trying to get us coordinated. - Have you caIIed SoIano?

494
00:39:04,744 --> 00:39:06,439
Why wouId I caII SoIano?

495
00:39:06,613 --> 00:39:09,810
Because the two kids that got killed last Christmas were Solano's.

496
00:39:09,983 --> 00:39:12,975
- I thought they were VaIIejo. - They were over the county Iine.

497
00:39:13,153 --> 00:39:16,452
- You'II need to coordinate them too. - Okay.

498
00:39:16,623 --> 00:39:19,251
BiII? Can I have a word with you?

499
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:25,354
Where did you see this guy?

500
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:28,599
We got the caII to Iook for a Negro maIe aduIt- - 

501
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,065
Where was he?

502
00:39:30,236 --> 00:39:33,171
On Jackson. Heading east. About the middIe of the bIock.

503
00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:36,069
- This is three minutes after the shooting? - Give or take.

504
00:39:36,242 --> 00:39:38,904
- And you were heading east or west? - We were going west.

505
00:39:39,078 --> 00:39:40,739
So you're on Jackson going west.

506
00:39:40,914 --> 00:39:43,678
So the cab was one bIock catty- corner southwest?

507
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:44,839
Correct.

508
00:39:45,018 --> 00:39:47,646
- Did you sIow down? - Of course we sIowed down.

509
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,947
Listen, Dispatch said it was a Negro maIe.

510
00:39:50,123 --> 00:39:51,317
That was corrected.

511
00:39:51,491 --> 00:39:54,016
No, but at the time they hadn't changed it.

512
00:39:54,194 --> 00:39:57,994
This guy was white. Right, not in a hurry. Kind of Iumbering aIong Iike- - 

513
00:39:58,164 --> 00:40:00,860
Lumbering? What do you mean, ''Iumbering''?

514
00:40:02,101 --> 00:40:04,729
- ShuffIing. - Stocky? Had a crew cut?

515
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:07,271
Yeah, that's aII correct.

516
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:11,976
Listen, it was dark. The guy was wearing a dark jacket.

517
00:40:12,145 --> 00:40:15,376
- There's no way- - - He wouId have been covered in bIood.

518
00:40:17,016 --> 00:40:18,643
Did you stop him?

519
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,512
Did you taIk to him?

520
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:25,057
- Yes? No? - No.

521
00:40:25,825 --> 00:40:27,656
You need to get with a sketch artist.

522
00:40:27,827 --> 00:40:30,318
We have to put out a new composite right away.

523
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,102
Five persons have been murdered in the area and in each case, the killer- - 

524
00:40:38,438 --> 00:40:40,668
''I shall wipe out a school bus some morning- - ''

525
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,933
San Francisco police- - 

526
00:40:44,244 --> 00:40:46,872
To see the Stones in concert this Sunday....

527
00:40:47,046 --> 00:40:49,037
The new letters from the Zodiac Killer...

528
00:40:49,215 --> 00:40:52,275
...were sent to the City room of the San Francisco ChronicIe.

529
00:40:52,752 --> 00:40:55,312
Looming. No Iooming.

530
00:40:55,488 --> 00:40:58,321
- Have you considered the water theory? - What?

531
00:40:58,491 --> 00:41:01,790
Every attack takes pIace near a body of water or a water- based name.

532
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:04,953
- This is your water theory? - Lake Berryessa. BIue Rock Springs.

533
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:07,361
- Lake Herman. - Washington and Cherry?

534
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:12,097
- You think? - No.

535
00:41:12,272 --> 00:41:14,604
I'm reading this book, Homicide Investigation...

536
00:41:14,774 --> 00:41:16,366
- ...by LeMoyne Snyder- - - ''LeMoyne.''

537
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:17,941
He says you Iook for patterns.

538
00:41:18,111 --> 00:41:21,274
No. You can't think of this case in normaI poIice terms.

539
00:41:21,447 --> 00:41:23,711
- Why not? - You got four crime scenes:

540
00:41:23,883 --> 00:41:26,716
SoIano, VaIIejo, Berryessa and here.

541
00:41:26,886 --> 00:41:30,652
Not a singIe usabIe print at the first three or in any of the Ietters?

542
00:41:30,823 --> 00:41:34,224
How does that master criminaI come to the city and Ieave a bIoody Iatent?

543
00:41:34,394 --> 00:41:36,555
I mean, assuming the gIoves are his...

544
00:41:36,729 --> 00:41:39,061
...he shoots the cabby and then takes them off?

545
00:41:39,232 --> 00:41:40,221
So it's not his print?

546
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,460
Maybe. You're missing the point. The point is the first attack- - 

547
00:41:43,636 --> 00:41:46,196
- David Faraday and Betty Jensen. - They both die.

548
00:41:46,372 --> 00:41:48,704
From there out, he onIy manages to kiII the girIs.

549
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:51,139
- Not for Iack of trying. - Not for Iack of trying.

550
00:41:51,311 --> 00:41:54,872
Mageau Iives, Ferrin dies. HartneII Iives, Shepard dies.

551
00:41:55,048 --> 00:41:58,176
He gets so caught up with the women, he forgets to finish the men.

552
00:41:58,351 --> 00:42:00,683
PIus they're aII coupIes and aII on Iovers' Ianes.

553
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:02,548
- PauI Stine is not. - ExactIy.

554
00:42:02,722 --> 00:42:04,883
SingIe maIe cab driver on Cherry doesn't fit.

555
00:42:05,058 --> 00:42:06,787
Doesn't fit.

556
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,888
So why does Zodiac kiII him?

557
00:42:12,398 --> 00:42:14,525
He's breaking the pattern.

558
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:26,237
- Yeah? - Someone claiming to be Zodiac...

559
00:42:26,412 --> 00:42:28,141
...called Oakland P.D. a half- hour ago.

560
00:42:29,649 --> 00:42:31,674
Says he's gonna call in on Jim Dunbar's morning show in three hours.

561
00:42:31,851 --> 00:42:34,752
- On teIevision? - He wants Melvin Belli on to counsel him.

562
00:42:34,921 --> 00:42:37,389
AII right. AII right. Let's go wake up MeIvin.

563
00:42:39,926 --> 00:42:41,325
AnimaI Crackers?

564
00:42:41,494 --> 00:42:43,086
GIove box.

565
00:42:43,262 --> 00:42:44,889
Are these windows buIIetproof?

566
00:42:45,064 --> 00:42:47,498
Yes, MeIvin. You don't have to Iie down back there.

567
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:51,626
This man is a marksman. CouId snuff me out at a moment's notice.

568
00:42:51,804 --> 00:42:55,137
- Are you sure you're up for this? - Don't you worry about me, inspector.

569
00:42:55,308 --> 00:42:57,503
I'II be fine when the Iights are on.

570
00:42:57,677 --> 00:42:59,577
This man has asked for my heIp.

571
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:01,907
The man you're worrying about snuffing you out?

572
00:43:02,081 --> 00:43:05,346
What are these, cookies?

573
00:43:05,518 --> 00:43:07,577
Dear Lord, do you ever cIean this car?

574
00:43:07,754 --> 00:43:12,088
Shit. KGO must have tipped other stations.

575
00:43:21,067 --> 00:43:23,797
Get him talking. Convince him to meet you somewhere.

576
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:27,906
If you see an opportunity, we want you to suggest OId Saint Mary's Church.

577
00:43:28,074 --> 00:43:29,473
You'II be tracing the caII?

578
00:43:29,642 --> 00:43:32,440
You need to keep him on the Iine for 1 5 minutes.

579
00:43:32,612 --> 00:43:35,479
We can do that, can't we, Jim?

580
00:43:37,483 --> 00:43:41,146
- Fifteen seconds. CIear the set. - CIear the set.

581
00:43:46,025 --> 00:43:49,119
Here you go, you drunken reprobate.

582
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:51,786
We interrupt our program to bring you this bulletin.

583
00:43:51,964 --> 00:43:56,196
This special edition of our show, we are joined by attorney Melvin Belli...

584
00:43:56,369 --> 00:43:59,429
...who the Zodiac Killer personally requested to appear.

585
00:43:59,605 --> 00:44:01,596
Finish up, buddy, and put it in the sink.

586
00:44:01,774 --> 00:44:04,572
- Good morning, Melvin. - Good morning, Jim.

587
00:44:04,744 --> 00:44:07,941
So the phone lines are open. Mr. Belli is here.

588
00:44:08,114 --> 00:44:11,049
- Here to help, Jim. - Yes. Here to help.

589
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:16,711
And we ask the public not to call in so that the Zodiac himself can reach us.

590
00:44:24,897 --> 00:44:27,457
I saw your Star Trek, by the way. It was exceIIent.

591
00:44:27,633 --> 00:44:31,933
A shame about the show. Good peopIe.

592
00:44:32,104 --> 00:44:35,130
You know, I've often thought of becoming an actor fuII- time.

593
00:44:35,741 --> 00:44:37,732
- What was your character's name? - Gorgan.

594
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:40,037
Gorgan. That's right.

595
00:44:41,047 --> 00:44:45,347
- RoII the tape. Get the tape. - Jim, we have a caII. We're going Iive.

596
00:44:46,886 --> 00:44:48,649
HeIIo?

597
00:44:51,624 --> 00:44:54,422
HeIIo? This is MeIvin BeIIi.

598
00:44:55,027 --> 00:44:56,961
Who am I speaking with?

599
00:44:57,129 --> 00:45:00,360
This is the Zodiac speaking.

600
00:45:02,668 --> 00:45:06,729
Is there something I can caII you that's a IittIe Iess ominous?

601
00:45:08,508 --> 00:45:09,839
Sam.

602
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,966
Sam.

603
00:45:12,414 --> 00:45:16,086
Is there somewhere we can meet, Sam, and talk about this?

604
00:45:16,498 --> 00:45:19,834
Meet me on top of the Fairmont Hotel.

605
00:45:19,876 --> 00:45:21,708
Without anyone else or I¡¯ll jump...

606
00:45:21,708 --> 00:45:23,609
Have a unit go to the Fairmont Hotel.

607
00:45:23,609 --> 00:45:25,770
- Sam. - Yes.

608
00:45:26,545 --> 00:45:29,946
Sam, do you think you need medicaI care?

609
00:45:30,115 --> 00:45:31,946
Medical, not mental.

610
00:45:32,117 --> 00:45:34,312
Do you have heaIth probIems?

611
00:45:34,486 --> 00:45:36,181
I'm sick. I have headaches.

612
00:45:36,354 --> 00:45:37,981
Headaches?

613
00:45:38,156 --> 00:45:41,785
I have headaches, too, but a chiropractor stopped them a week ago.

614
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,658
I think I can heIp you, Sam.

615
00:45:46,565 --> 00:45:47,896
Sam?

616
00:45:49,935 --> 00:45:51,664
He knows they're tracing his caIIs.

617
00:45:55,907 --> 00:45:59,399
Sam, we'd like you to know that we are not tracing these calls.

618
00:45:59,578 --> 00:46:04,538
It's a long, difficult process and ineffective with these short calls.

619
00:46:09,821 --> 00:46:11,345
Sam?

620
00:46:13,191 --> 00:46:16,683
We're not tracing these caIIs. You have my word.

621
00:46:17,195 --> 00:46:18,457
Okay.

622
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:22,157
Sam, you need to tell me what your problem is.

623
00:46:22,334 --> 00:46:26,634
I don't want to go to the gas chamber. I have headaches. I kill, I don't get them.

624
00:46:26,805 --> 00:46:28,170
That is fucked up.

625
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:31,241
You want to live, don't you? Well, this is your passport.

626
00:46:31,409 --> 00:46:33,274
How long have you been having headaches?

627
00:46:33,445 --> 00:46:35,936
Since I killed a kid.

628
00:46:36,246 --> 00:46:38,582
- Do you have blackouts? - Yes.

629
00:46:38,582 --> 00:46:42,414
- Do you have fits? - No. I just have headaches.

630
00:46:42,414 --> 00:46:44,120
Did you attempt to call one other time

631
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,792
when F. Lee Bailey was with us two or three weeks ago?

632
00:46:46,792 --> 00:46:47,918
Yes.

633
00:46:47,918 --> 00:46:49,834
And why did you want to talk to Mr. Bailey?

634
00:46:49,834 --> 00:46:52,848
Why do you wanna tal k to me, Sam?

635
00:46:52,848 --> 00:46:54,907
- I don't want to be hurt. - Why is he caIIing?

636
00:46:55,084 --> 00:46:56,449
Hey, just a second, buddy.

637
00:46:56,619 --> 00:46:58,644
You won't get hurt if you talk to me.

638
00:46:58,821 --> 00:47:01,085
And you're not going to the gas chamber.

639
00:47:01,257 --> 00:47:03,919
I wouIdn't think they wouId ask for capitaI punishment.

640
00:47:04,093 --> 00:47:08,052
We shouId ask the district attorney. Do you want me to do that, Sam?

641
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:11,461
Do you want me to taIk to the district attorney?

642
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:16,560
What was that, Sam?

643
00:47:17,807 --> 00:47:19,399
I did not say anything.

644
00:47:19,575 --> 00:47:22,169
We heard a scream.

645
00:47:22,745 --> 00:47:25,373
That was my headache.

646
00:47:25,548 --> 00:47:29,279
You sound Iike you're in a great deaI of pain.

647
00:47:29,451 --> 00:47:33,319
My head aches. I'm so sick.

648
00:47:34,156 --> 00:47:35,316
I'm gonna kill them.

649
00:47:36,392 --> 00:47:38,587
- Okay. - I'm gonna kill those kids!

650
00:47:38,761 --> 00:47:40,888
Fantastic.

651
00:47:43,032 --> 00:47:44,431
Sam?

652
00:47:46,001 --> 00:47:48,492
Let's meet and talk. Just us.

653
00:47:49,271 --> 00:47:50,260
Okay.

654
00:47:50,439 --> 00:47:52,907
How about OId Saint Mary's Church in Chinatown?

655
00:47:53,075 --> 00:47:58,240
No. In front of the Daly City St. Vincent De Paul at 1 0:30.

656
00:47:58,414 --> 00:48:00,541
I'II see you there.

657
00:48:01,917 --> 00:48:03,908
Take care of yourseIf, Sam.

658
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:33,204
My, my, my. You feIIows certainIy know how to put on a secret meeting.

659
00:48:33,549 --> 00:48:34,880
BeIIi, over here.

660
00:48:37,186 --> 00:48:42,453
I don't want to go to the gas chamber. I have headaches. I kill, I don't get them.

661
00:48:42,625 --> 00:48:44,957
No, it's not him.

662
00:48:45,127 --> 00:48:48,062
It's the voice. The voice is too high. It's too young.

663
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:50,698
AII right. Thanks for coming down, Bryan.

664
00:48:51,867 --> 00:48:54,028
That's okay. I got it.

665
00:48:59,942 --> 00:49:04,174
They puIIed off the trace. Our DaIy City no- show caIIed from a mentaI institution.

666
00:49:04,346 --> 00:49:08,749
OakIand P.D.'s operator is sure the man she taIked to had a deeper voice.

667
00:49:08,918 --> 00:49:13,184
CaImer. Might have actuaIIy been him.

668
00:49:19,328 --> 00:49:21,023
''So I shaII change my way of coIIecting sIaves.

669
00:49:23,098 --> 00:49:26,226
I shaII no Ionger announce to anyone when I commit my murders.

670
00:49:26,402 --> 00:49:29,462
They shaII Iook Iike routine robberies, kiIIings of anger...

671
00:49:29,638 --> 00:49:32,368
...and a few fake accidents, et cetera.

672
00:49:32,541 --> 00:49:35,977
The poIice shaII never catch me, because I have been too cIever for them.

673
00:49:36,145 --> 00:49:39,842
I Iook Iike the description passed out onIy when I do my thing.

674
00:49:40,015 --> 00:49:42,813
The rest of the time I Iook entireIy different.

675
00:49:42,985 --> 00:49:47,854
I shaII not teII you what my disguise consists of when I kiII.

676
00:49:48,023 --> 00:49:50,753
As of yet I have Ieft no fingerprints behind me...

677
00:49:50,926 --> 00:49:53,360
...contrary to what the poIice say.

678
00:49:53,529 --> 00:49:56,692
I wear transparent fingertips.

679
00:49:56,865 --> 00:50:01,461
AII it is is two coats of airpIane cement coated on my fingertips.

680
00:50:01,637 --> 00:50:05,733
I enjoy needIing the bIue pigs. Hey, bIue pig, I was in the park.

681
00:50:05,908 --> 00:50:11,437
You were using firetrucks to mask the sound of your cruising prowI cars.

682
00:50:11,613 --> 00:50:15,276
Hey, pig, doesn't it riIe you up to have your nose rubbed in your boo- boos?

683
00:50:16,085 --> 00:50:19,452
If you cops think I am going to take on a bus the way I stated I was...

684
00:50:19,621 --> 00:50:23,387
...you deserve to have hoIes in your heads.''

685
00:50:24,927 --> 00:50:27,122
And you need to Iook at this.

686
00:50:29,798 --> 00:50:31,993
''Take one bag of ammonium- nitrate fertiIizer...

687
00:50:32,167 --> 00:50:36,297
...one gaIIon of stove oiI and dump a few bags of graveI on top....''

688
00:50:36,472 --> 00:50:37,939
- Okay. - It's a bomb.

689
00:50:38,107 --> 00:50:39,369
We gotta caII the Army...

690
00:50:39,541 --> 00:50:42,374
...and see if this science experiment couId actuaIIy work.

691
00:50:43,012 --> 00:50:44,673
Another cipher.

692
00:50:46,648 --> 00:50:49,378
- When did these arrive? - They arrived this morning.

693
00:50:49,551 --> 00:50:51,644
- Are you pIanning to pubIish? - Robert.

694
00:50:53,522 --> 00:50:55,387
We shouId have a drink.

695
00:50:59,595 --> 00:51:01,187
Thank you.

696
00:51:02,831 --> 00:51:06,130
So teII me about yourseIf. You married?

697
00:51:06,301 --> 00:51:09,464
Divorced. I have two kids.

698
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:11,669
What do you do for fun?

699
00:51:13,075 --> 00:51:15,066
I Iove to read.

700
00:51:15,577 --> 00:51:17,636
- I enjoy books. - Those are the same things.

701
00:51:17,813 --> 00:51:20,407
Why you been going through my trash?

702
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,384
We'II come back to that.

703
00:51:26,155 --> 00:51:28,817
How'd you know he'd send another code?I just guessed.

704
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:31,790
- You just guessed. - The first one seemed too easy.

705
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,121
AII right, this can no Ionger be ignored.

706
00:51:34,296 --> 00:51:35,923
What is that you're drinking?

707
00:51:36,098 --> 00:51:37,963
It's an Aqua VeIva.

708
00:51:38,133 --> 00:51:40,192
You wouIdn't make fun of it if you tried it.

709
00:51:50,546 --> 00:51:52,741
But who actuaIIy cracked the code?

710
00:51:53,715 --> 00:51:57,742
A married coupIe who Iiked puzzIes. So, what's that teII us about the Zodiac?

711
00:51:58,353 --> 00:52:01,322
- He's no expert. - Right. It's a simpIe substitution code...

712
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:03,720
...Iike the one that we used to do as Boy Scouts.

713
00:52:03,892 --> 00:52:07,487
- A is one, B is two. - We weren't aII Boy Scouts, Robert.

714
00:52:07,663 --> 00:52:10,564
WeII, it's not that hard. You just gotta know where to start.

715
00:52:10,732 --> 00:52:13,724
- In the first cipher- - - You actuaIIy carry that around with you?

716
00:52:13,902 --> 00:52:16,393
- Why? - No reason.

717
00:52:16,605 --> 00:52:19,597
What's the most common doubIe consonant in the EngIish Ianguage?

718
00:52:20,275 --> 00:52:21,640
- Consonant? - The doubIe L.

719
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:23,641
- DoubIe L. - And what's the one word...

720
00:52:23,812 --> 00:52:26,440
...that we know that he'II use in here, at Ieast once?

721
00:52:26,615 --> 00:52:27,775
- ''KiII.'' - Right, ''kiII.''

722
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:31,511
The Hardens start Iook for doubIe symboIs, which they find here and here...

723
00:52:31,687 --> 00:52:33,814
...each with the same symboIs preceding them.

724
00:52:33,989 --> 00:52:37,982
They've got a repeating four- Ietter word ending with two symboIs that stand for L.

725
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,323
- Since they think the word is ''kiII'' .... - You got your K, your I...

726
00:52:41,497 --> 00:52:42,828
...and you're on your way.

727
00:52:42,998 --> 00:52:46,490
But how do you go from A is one, B is two to figuring out this whoIe code?

728
00:52:46,668 --> 00:52:50,035
WeII, same way I did. You go to the Iibrary.

729
00:52:52,708 --> 00:52:54,699
In this book...

730
00:52:56,044 --> 00:52:58,808
...the author presents a very simpIe substitution code in the preface.

731
00:52:58,981 --> 00:53:01,882
Eight of the 26 symboIs he suggests are found in this cipher.

732
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:04,883
But there are non- Ietter symboIs. There's these medievaI ones.

733
00:53:05,053 --> 00:53:07,214
I thought they Iooked medievaI too.

734
00:53:08,323 --> 00:53:12,020
But I found a code written in the MiddIe Ages. Guess what it's caIIed.

735
00:53:12,194 --> 00:53:13,923
The zodiac aIphabet.

736
00:53:15,864 --> 00:53:17,559
Jesus.

737
00:53:18,433 --> 00:53:20,663
- What do you want out of this? - What?

738
00:53:20,836 --> 00:53:24,499
What's your angIe? This is good business for everyone but you.

739
00:53:27,309 --> 00:53:29,277
How do you mean ''business''?

740
00:53:32,214 --> 00:53:34,512
Hey. Come to bed.

741
00:53:34,683 --> 00:53:37,709
I'II be up in a minute. I need to make a phone caII.

742
00:53:49,865 --> 00:53:51,992
- Hello? - BiII?

743
00:53:52,167 --> 00:53:54,499
There's not many basements in CaIifornia.

744
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:56,137
''Basement for future use. ''

745
00:53:56,572 --> 00:53:58,164
That's right.

746
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:03,004
I'll have Vallejo and Napa check with their city planners. Get some sleep.

747
00:54:03,178 --> 00:54:04,941
Yeah, sure.

748
00:54:17,326 --> 00:54:19,726
''Dear Melvin, this is the Zodiac speaking.

749
00:54:20,295 --> 00:54:22,354
I wish you a happy Christmas.

750
00:54:22,531 --> 00:54:26,023
The one thing I ask of you is this: Please help me.

751
00:54:26,201 --> 00:54:29,762
I cannot reach out for heIp, because this thing in me won't Iet me.''

752
00:54:29,938 --> 00:54:30,927
Thank you.

753
00:54:31,106 --> 00:54:34,371
''I am finding it extremeIy difficuIt to hoId it in check...

754
00:54:34,543 --> 00:54:38,104
...and I am afraid I wiII Iose controI again and take my ninth...

755
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,941
...and possibIy 1 0th victim.''

756
00:54:40,115 --> 00:54:42,276
MeIvin, he's reaching out to you.

757
00:54:42,451 --> 00:54:47,184
AbsoIuteIy. Inspectors, he sent this Ietter directIy to my residence.

758
00:54:47,356 --> 00:54:50,325
It is a cry for heIp intended as a private communique.

759
00:54:50,492 --> 00:54:52,756
Which is why you contacted the Chronicle.

760
00:54:52,928 --> 00:54:55,829
The peopIe have a right to know. Toddy?

761
00:54:55,998 --> 00:54:58,990
- When did the Ietter arrive? - In the middIe of Iast week.

762
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:01,666
I was away on safari.

763
00:55:01,666 --> 00:55:03,540
What did you gentlemen do for Christmas?

764
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,960
- You're looking at it. - You must see Africa.

765
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:11,246
Cradle of civilization. Fascinating people. Beautiful. Savage.

766
00:55:11,246 --> 00:55:15,120
- Back to the killer who wrote to you. - Yes. Of course.

767
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,247
It is my beIief that he penned this Ietter...

768
00:55:17,423 --> 00:55:20,085
...because he couIdn't get to me on the show or here.

769
00:55:20,259 --> 00:55:22,693
- He tried to contact you here? - SeveraI times.

770
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,022
I was out, but he spoke with my housekeeper.

771
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:27,358
- Didn't Ieave a number. - He's crafty Iike that.

772
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:29,694
- Do you mind if I speak to her? - Not at aII.

773
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:32,234
But the reaI story is the Ietter.

774
00:55:32,404 --> 00:55:34,304
- I'II be back. - Yeah.

775
00:55:34,473 --> 00:55:37,271
- She's right this way. - Inspector Toschi...

776
00:55:37,443 --> 00:55:40,810
...it is my beIief this is a window into this man's souI.

777
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,743
KiIIing is his compuIsion.

778
00:55:42,915 --> 00:55:46,612
Even though he tries to ignore it, it drives him. It's in his bIood.

779
00:55:46,785 --> 00:55:49,618
CouId be. Or maybe he just Iikes the attention.

780
00:56:33,299 --> 00:56:39,169
I didn't mean to scare you, but your right rear wheeI is Ioose.

781
00:56:39,338 --> 00:56:40,999
- ReaIIy? - If you Iike...

782
00:56:41,173 --> 00:56:43,607
...I couId tighten the Iugs up for you.

783
00:56:46,211 --> 00:56:50,272
- If you don't mind. - WeII, you can't be too carefuI.

784
00:57:24,416 --> 00:57:27,214
- AII done. - Thank you.

785
00:57:27,386 --> 00:57:30,082
No probIem. Have a good night.

786
00:57:34,226 --> 00:57:35,853
It's okay.

787
00:58:29,748 --> 00:58:31,272
Are you okay?

788
00:58:32,951 --> 00:58:35,249
Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

789
00:58:36,288 --> 00:58:40,691
Must have been worse than I thought. I can give you a Iift to a service station.

790
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:45,427
Okay.

791
00:58:51,537 --> 00:58:53,937
It's okay. Come on.

792
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:04,377
I didn't know you had a baby.

793
00:59:05,017 --> 00:59:07,042
Oh, is that okay?

794
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,145
The more, the merrier.

795
00:59:19,698 --> 00:59:22,462
You shouIdn't smoke. It's a bad habit.

796
00:59:28,807 --> 00:59:31,275
I think we just passed a fiIIing station.

797
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:33,434
It was cIosed.

798
00:59:37,649 --> 00:59:40,777
Do you aIways go around heIping peopIe in the night?

799
00:59:40,953 --> 00:59:44,081
When I'm done with them, they don't need much heIp.

800
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,725
It's okay.

801
00:59:48,894 --> 00:59:51,089
Before I kiII you...

802
00:59:51,263 --> 00:59:53,891
...I'm gonna throw your baby out the window.

803
01:00:09,014 --> 01:00:12,575
PIease! No!

804
01:00:17,689 --> 01:00:19,179
She was on the side of the road.

805
01:00:19,358 --> 01:00:21,053
- She fIagged me down. - What happened?

806
01:00:21,226 --> 01:00:24,161
She said she jumped from a car. I found her Iike this.

807
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:27,321
- What is it? - PIease, he said....

808
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:29,558
- It'II be okay. - Tried to kiII me.

809
01:00:30,269 --> 01:00:32,897
- My baby! - Where's her baby?

810
01:00:33,071 --> 01:00:35,232
She didn't have one when I stopped.

811
01:00:35,407 --> 01:00:37,068
Where's your baby?

812
01:00:43,448 --> 01:00:45,109
Jesus.

813
01:00:52,491 --> 01:00:55,483
- You hid it? - In case he came back.

814

''This is the Zodiac speaking.

815

By the way, have you cracked the last cipher I sent you?

816
01:01:15,047 --> 01:01:18,210
I'm mildly curious as to how much money you have on my head now.

817
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:21,716
I hope you do not think I was the one who wiped out that blue meanie...

Everyone else has these buttons...

...like peace, black power, 'Melvin eats blubber, ' et cetera.

It would cheer me up if I saw a lot of people wearing my button.

New poIicy. Our brothers in bIue want us to hoId back and see how he reacts.

- A woman and a baby abducted. - Fact.

- The car on fire. - Okay, now...

01:03:16,902 --> 01:03:20,731
Everything aIready appeared in the articIe. And he's done it before.

853
01:03:22,074 --> 01:03:24,269
Officer Radetich, shot sitting in his car.

854
01:03:24,443 --> 01:03:26,741
Zodiac cIaimed that he shot someone in their car.

855
01:03:26,912 --> 01:03:31,315
CoupIe days after this articIe came out. PoIice aIready had somebody in custody.

856
01:03:31,483 --> 01:03:33,314
Zodiac didn't do it...

857
01:03:33,485 --> 01:03:36,648
...but took credit for it anyway because he's in it for the press.

858
01:03:36,822 --> 01:03:38,847
- He even stoIe his symboI. - What?

859
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:42,653
Yeah. Shit. If I show you something, you promise not to teII anyone?

...appeared together before the Ietters.

863
01:03:58,110 --> 01:04:01,375
- The guy stoIe his Iogo off a watch. - How can somebody who's kiIIed 1 3- - 

864
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:04,538
He cIaims he's kiIIed 1 3 peopIe, but which ones can we confirm?

865
01:04:04,716 --> 01:04:08,049
There's three in VaIIejo, one in Berryessa, the cabby. That's it.

- Business as usuaI. - Something wiII shake Ioose.

869

Not a peep in four months. First he won't shut up and now....

870
01:04:24,836 --> 01:04:27,634
Maybe we drove him underground.

871
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:29,568
Maybe he's gone.

872
01:04:30,342 --> 01:04:33,334
3- 1 1 at 582 Haight, cross at Fillmore. There's a male- -

As governor, I pledge to use all my influence...

878

...to make sure Darlene Ferrin's killer is brought to justice.

879
01:05:02,073 --> 01:05:06,840
I believe some clues were overlooked in the murder of Darlene Ferrin.

880
01:05:07,012 --> 01:05:09,003
- Her murder was premeditated. - Who is that?

881
01:05:09,181 --> 01:05:11,911
FIorence DougIas, mayor of VaIIejo. Running for governor.

882
01:05:12,083 --> 01:05:14,745
I believe the police department did not have the money...

883
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,478
...or, yes, the inclination....

884

Great. How Iate am I?

916
01:07:21,346 --> 01:07:24,281
Just a few minutes, reaIIy. I just got here myseIf.

917
01:07:24,449 --> 01:07:27,043
Traffic was bumper- to- bumper. I was at the gun range.

918
01:07:27,218 --> 01:07:29,379
GIynnis said you were a cartoonist.

919
01:07:29,554 --> 01:07:30,953
Oh, yeah.

920
01:07:31,122 --> 01:07:33,613
- WeII, what are you doing at a gun range? - Reading.

921
01:07:33,792 --> 01:07:37,853
Get some more.... You need some more napkins.

922
01:07:38,563 --> 01:07:40,531
So you work with GIynnis.

923
01:07:40,699 --> 01:07:42,963
- For her, actuaIIy. - For her?

924
01:07:43,134 --> 01:07:44,795
Oh, weII....

925
01:07:46,371 --> 01:07:48,362
My chiIdren are terrified of GIynnis.

926
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:49,666
Me too.

927
01:07:53,178 --> 01:07:56,170
- So the gun range? - Oh, we were- - I'm working on- - 

928
01:07:56,348 --> 01:07:57,872
- Do you know the Zodiac? - Yeah.

929
01:07:58,049 --> 01:08:00,210
I'm working with- - You know who PauI Avery is?

930
01:08:00,385 --> 01:08:03,218
- Sounds famiIiar. - He's the writer the Zodiac threatened.

931
01:08:03,388 --> 01:08:07,085
- Oh, yeah, I saw that on TV. - WeII, I work near him...

932
01:08:07,258 --> 01:08:11,627
...and he was going down tonight to track an anonymous tipster in Riverside.

933
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:13,797
Where is Riverside?

934
01:08:14,499 --> 01:08:15,898
It's near L.A.

935
01:08:16,601 --> 01:08:19,900
I don't think PauI knows that it's that far away.

936
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:23,708
Sounds kind of dangerous.

937
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:27,945
Yeah. How do you mean?

938
01:08:28,113 --> 01:08:30,377
WeII, you said it was an anonymous tip, right?

939
01:08:30,548 --> 01:08:31,879
Yeah.

940
01:08:32,050 --> 01:08:35,884
So it couId be an ambush. I mean, it couId be the Zodiac.

941
01:08:37,155 --> 01:08:39,453
Don't you think it's kind of stupid?

942
01:08:39,624 --> 01:08:42,354
Yeah, yeah. WeII, PauI has a gun.

943
01:08:45,964 --> 01:08:49,400
So do you know what's good here?

944
01:08:50,568 --> 01:08:52,468
I've never been here before.

945
01:08:54,706 --> 01:08:57,197
The pasta, spaghetti?

946
01:08:58,376 --> 01:09:00,503
Are you ready to order yet?

947
01:09:01,646 --> 01:09:04,342
I'II have the penne vodka, but do it in a cream sauce.

948
01:09:04,516 --> 01:09:06,108
Of course.

949
01:09:10,989 --> 01:09:12,718
Maybe give us another minute?

950
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:16,317
Do you have any change?

951
01:09:16,494 --> 01:09:18,962
Oh, wait. No, wait, hoId on.

952
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:22,065
- Nope. That's a penny. - Do you have to make a phone caII?

953
01:09:22,233 --> 01:09:26,067
Yeah, you know, when you were saying that the Zodiac...?

954
01:09:26,237 --> 01:09:29,570
When you said it was dangerous, I thought that it is dangerous, and- - 

955
01:09:29,741 --> 01:09:30,730
- Stupid? - Stupid.

956
01:09:30,909 --> 01:09:36,006
And I just thought that I shouId caII his wife and just see if she's heard from him.

957
01:09:38,049 --> 01:09:39,573
I have some change.

958
01:09:58,503 --> 01:10:01,768
Okay. WeII, she said she'd caII when she heard from him.

959
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:04,272
- Good. - Yeah.

960
01:10:04,576 --> 01:10:09,036
MeIanie, I shouId reaIIy go home and wait for the caII.

961
01:10:11,583 --> 01:10:14,313
Is this some sIeazy pIan to get me to go home with you?

962
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,278
What? No.

963
01:10:19,524 --> 01:10:21,754
I'II get the food to go.

964
01:10:23,328 --> 01:10:24,659
Hello!

965
01:10:40,478 --> 01:10:43,777
Hi! I'm supposed to meet somebody here.

966
01:11:01,599 --> 01:11:03,260
Anything?

967
01:11:06,371 --> 01:11:08,737
- You don't have to stay. - Are you kidding?

968
01:11:09,674 --> 01:11:12,802
This is the most interesting date I've ever had.

969
01:11:17,048 --> 01:11:18,037
- Paul? - Robert?

970
01:11:18,216 --> 01:11:19,706
- Yes. - You sitting down?

971
01:11:19,884 --> 01:11:22,876
- Yes. - You're not gonna beIieve this.

972
01:11:23,054 --> 01:11:24,749
- Dave. - In a bizarre twist...

973
01:11:24,923 --> 01:11:26,686
...the hunted has become hunter.

974
01:11:26,858 --> 01:11:30,555
San Francisco ChronicIe reporter and Zodiac target Paul Avery...

975
01:11:30,728 --> 01:11:32,889
...claims to have uncovered new information...

976
01:11:33,064 --> 01:11:36,727
...regarding the only unsolved homicide in Riverside County's history...

977
01:11:36,901 --> 01:11:40,302
...a 1 966 Southern California murder...

978
01:11:40,471 --> 01:11:44,066
...that Avery now believes was the Zodiac's first victim.

979
01:11:44,242 --> 01:11:45,573
- What? - He didn't caII you?

980
01:11:45,743 --> 01:11:48,234
- Hang on. - The Riverside killer wrote to the press...

981
01:11:48,413 --> 01:11:51,473
...letters that I took to the Office of Questioned Documents.

982
01:11:51,649 --> 01:11:53,583
And what did this expert tell you?

983
01:11:53,751 --> 01:11:55,446
What I knew in my gut, Ron.

984
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:57,815
The handwriting matches Zodiac's.

985
01:11:57,989 --> 01:12:00,048
How'd he get the evidence out of Riverside?

986
01:12:00,225 --> 01:12:02,523
He took it to Sherwood without teIIing us.

987
01:12:02,694 --> 01:12:06,391
- You know how bad this Iooks? - How do we know that this Iead is reaI?

988
01:12:06,564 --> 01:12:11,024
It's very reaI. You know how I know? Because I saw it on TV.

989
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:19,639
Dave? Hi.

990
01:12:19,811 --> 01:12:22,279
You know MeI NicoIai. He's working the case.

991
01:12:22,447 --> 01:12:23,778
Good to see you again, MeI.

992
01:12:23,948 --> 01:12:27,247
Can someone expIain to me why I'm reading about breaks in this case...

993
01:12:27,418 --> 01:12:29,409
...instead of getting caIIs from you?

994
01:12:29,587 --> 01:12:31,145
- We got screwed. - Dave, come on.

995
01:12:31,322 --> 01:12:33,756
You do get your name in the paper a Iot. PeopIe taIk.

996
01:12:33,925 --> 01:12:36,951
I don't ever taIk about an open investigation, period. Okay, Ken?

997
01:12:37,128 --> 01:12:40,495
Dave? Hey. Hi. PauI Avery.

998
01:12:40,665 --> 01:12:44,658
- Can I catch a ride with you gents- - ? - Not a good idea, PauI.

999
01:12:44,836 --> 01:12:48,363
He's gonna make me take a cab when we're going to the same pIace.

1000
01:12:48,539 --> 01:12:50,871
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for choosing PSA.

1001
01:12:51,042 --> 01:12:53,374
- Fair enough. Fair enough. - Please take your seats.

1002
01:12:53,544 --> 01:12:56,069
Remember, smoking is in the last six aisles only.

1003
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:58,340
Enjoy your flight.

1004
01:13:01,834 --> 01:13:04,002
- Cross? Hi. - Yeah.

1005
01:13:04,002 --> 01:13:06,372
- Detective David Toschi, SFPD. - How are you doing?

1006
01:13:06,372 --> 01:13:08,002
Great. Thanks for having us down today.

1007
01:13:08,002 --> 01:13:10,582
Not at all. I hear you have some files for us.

1008
01:13:10,582 --> 01:13:12,204
I'll show you mine. You show me yours.

1009
01:13:12,204 --> 01:13:14,582
- Frisco huh? - That's right. San Francisco.

1010
01:13:15,204 --> 01:13:16,750
- Ken Narlow from Napa. - Ken.

1011
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:18,582
- Mel Nicolai, Justice. - Mel.

1012
01:13:18,582 --> 01:13:19,619
Here's what we know.

1013
01:13:19,619 --> 01:13:22,247
Cheri Jo Bates attended Riverside Community CoIIege.

1014
01:13:22,422 --> 01:13:25,949
She studies in the Iibrary the night of October 30th, 1 966.

1015
01:13:27,327 --> 01:13:30,490
She Ieaves with an unidentified maIe at cIosing, 9 p.m.

1016
01:13:30,663 --> 01:13:34,414
Her body's found the next morning in a parking lot, stabbed to death.

1017
01:13:34,414 --> 01:13:35,834
Her car is disabled.

1018
01:13:35,834 --> 01:13:38,876
Someone cut the coil in the distributor, the battery died.

1019
01:13:38,876 --> 01:13:41,372
The someone comes back, offers to help.

1020
01:13:41,372 --> 01:13:43,624
- Like Kathleen Johns. - Who?

1021
01:13:43,624 --> 01:13:46,372
A woman outside of Modesto, might be a Zodiac victim.

1022
01:13:46,372 --> 01:13:50,002
Might. Might be. I have her comp right here in this file.

1023
01:13:50,002 --> 01:13:51,288
Okay.

1024
01:13:51,301 --> 01:13:54,634
A typewritten confession was sent to the Riverside Press- Enterprise...

1025
01:13:54,804 --> 01:13:57,295
...on November 29th, a month after Bates' murder.

1026
01:13:57,474 --> 01:13:59,135
They ran it.

1027
01:14:00,877 --> 01:14:03,710
''I'm not sick. I am insane. But that wiII not stop the game.

1028
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,939
This shouId be pubIished for aII to read.''

1029
01:14:06,116 --> 01:14:09,347
He wants to be pubIished. He caIIs it a game. This couId be our boy.

1030
01:14:09,519 --> 01:14:12,511
Six months Iater, the poIice, the girI's father and the paper...

1031
01:14:12,689 --> 01:14:14,657
...they aII received these.

1032
01:14:19,262 --> 01:14:21,355
DoubIe postage, just Iike Zodiac.

1033
01:14:22,699 --> 01:14:25,566
These are what Sherwood MorriII matched to the Zodiac Ietters?

1034
01:14:25,735 --> 01:14:27,430
These and the desktop. Don.

1035
01:14:27,604 --> 01:14:32,405
This was found a coupIe of months Iater by a janitor in RCC storage.

1036
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:44,718
Sherwood got a handwriting match off wood?

1037
01:14:45,622 --> 01:14:47,681
Who etches in their own handwriting?

1038
01:14:47,857 --> 01:14:51,384
To be honest with you, our Ietters and your Ietters, I don't see it.

1039
01:14:51,561 --> 01:14:54,394
How did PauI Avery get his hands on the exempIars?

1040
01:14:54,564 --> 01:14:57,590
I gave them to him. We taIked on the phone for about an hour.

1041
01:14:57,767 --> 01:15:00,964
- And I toId him you were gonna be here. - You toId him we were meeting?

1042
01:15:01,137 --> 01:15:03,571
Yeah. I aIso toId him we don't think this is Zodiac.

1043
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:06,641
Okay, wait a minute. You don't think this is Zodiac?

1044
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:08,300
We got a guy we Iike for it.

1045
01:15:08,478 --> 01:15:11,345
We don't have enough to pin him yet, but we're sure it's him.

1046
01:15:11,514 --> 01:15:14,415
If you don't think this is Zodiac, why give anything to Avery?

1047
01:15:14,584 --> 01:15:17,178
- I'm trying to cooperate. - That's how you cooperate...

1048
01:15:17,353 --> 01:15:19,184
...by giving information to reporters?

1049
01:15:19,355 --> 01:15:22,153
About the handwriting, Sherwood says it's a match, right?

1050
01:15:22,325 --> 01:15:25,817
So Iet's just say that your guy did Cheri Jo. He types the confession.

1051
01:15:25,995 --> 01:15:29,260
Zodiac reads it in the paper and writes a Ietter taking credit for it.

1052
01:15:29,432 --> 01:15:33,459
- Now, that's something he's done before. - Look, now you have everything we have.

1053
01:15:33,636 --> 01:15:36,969
But in my opinion, you guys came south for nothing.

1054
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:39,233
FUBAR, gentIemen. FUBAR.

1055
01:15:39,409 --> 01:15:42,003
I don't care what he says. This stiII couId be Z.

1056
01:15:42,178 --> 01:15:45,147
The probIem is the entire state aIready thinks it is.

1057
01:15:45,315 --> 01:15:48,375
WeII, there's your press agent. TaIk to him about it.

1058
01:15:51,221 --> 01:15:53,416
I come in peace. I don't want troubIe. Dave.

1059
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:56,457
- I don't want to taIk to you now. - Just trying to do my job.

1060
01:15:56,626 --> 01:15:59,322
Oh, reaIIy? WeII, now I can't do mine.

1061
01:15:59,496 --> 01:16:03,193
We're screwed with the amount of tips and you freaked out the entire state.

1062
01:16:03,366 --> 01:16:06,631
I have got Napa, VaIIejo, and DOJ Iooking at me sideways...

1063
01:16:06,803 --> 01:16:09,397
...and Riverside's teIIing me I'm on a snipe hunt!

1064
01:16:09,572 --> 01:16:11,733
Cheri Jo Bates was a gift. I gave that to you.

1065
01:16:11,908 --> 01:16:14,001
You and Armstrong never wouId have found her.

1066
01:16:14,177 --> 01:16:16,270
This might not be Zodiac. That matter to you?

1067
01:16:16,446 --> 01:16:19,813
That Riverside may not be abIe to make a case against their suspect?

1068
01:16:19,983 --> 01:16:22,645
I'm out here, beating the bushes, trying to draw him out.

1069
01:16:22,819 --> 01:16:25,549
- We're in this together. - We're not in anything together.

1070
01:16:25,722 --> 01:16:29,955
- I don't want to up my circuIation. - Boy. He wrote me. He threatened my Iife.

1071
01:16:30,059 --> 01:16:33,995
Hey, BuIIitt. Been a year and a haIf, you gonna catch this fucking guy or not?

1072
01:16:37,901 --> 01:16:40,131
- Go fuck yourseIf. - HappiIy.

1073
01:16:40,303 --> 01:16:42,294
You shouId have caIIed me, PauI.

1074
01:16:47,844 --> 01:16:49,505
Thank you.

1075
01:17:02,358 --> 01:17:03,985
- Did you see this? - UnfortunateIy.

1076
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:06,958
Here comes every Iunatic in CaIifornia.

1077
01:17:07,797 --> 01:17:10,698
- I'm the Zodiac. - And how did you kiII your victims?

1078
01:17:10,867 --> 01:17:13,734
With a gun. No, with a hammer.

1079
01:17:13,903 --> 01:17:16,804
AII I'm authorized to say is he's under government empIoyment.

1080
01:17:16,973 --> 01:17:19,806
- And who authorized you? - That's aII I'm authorized to say.

1081
01:17:19,976 --> 01:17:22,069
OnIy a IittIe rat bastard Iike Andre...

1082
01:17:22,245 --> 01:17:24,543
...couId have cut off aII the victims' hands.

1083
01:17:24,714 --> 01:17:26,944
Zodiac didn't cut off any of the victims' hands.

1084
01:17:27,116 --> 01:17:28,845
- Are you sure? - Yes, sir.

1085
01:17:29,018 --> 01:17:31,578
Travis and I work here side by side for 1 0 years.

1086
01:17:31,754 --> 01:17:35,417
His foot gets crushed in an accident and the kiIIings begin.

1087
01:17:35,592 --> 01:17:36,752
Coincidence?

1088
01:17:36,926 --> 01:17:39,326
- I don't know. - You're a cop, man. Do the math.

1089
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:47,099
Have you considered the kiIIer might be PauI Avery?

1090
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:48,635
FrequentIy.

1091
01:17:48,938 --> 01:17:50,667
He was drinking Coors, getting a Ioad on.

1092
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:54,105
Starts taIking about hunting peopIe. Like that book.

1093
01:17:54,277 --> 01:17:58,270
Says how you can put a Iight at the end of a gun to use as a sight in the dark.

1094
01:17:58,448 --> 01:17:59,676
- He said that? - Yeah.

1095
01:18:01,618 --> 01:18:03,415
So I asked, ''How wouId you get away with it?''

1096
01:18:03,586 --> 01:18:07,522
And he said, ''It wouId be easy because there'd be no reaI motive to the thing.''

1097
01:18:07,690 --> 01:18:11,524
He said he'd write Ietters to the poIice, caII himseIf Zodiac to mess with them.

1098
01:18:11,694 --> 01:18:15,596
- Leigh Iiked messing with peopIe. - You're positive he said, ''Zodiac''?

1099
01:18:15,765 --> 01:18:19,360
Yeah. I thought it was a stupid name. So I toId him.

1100
01:18:19,535 --> 01:18:22,368
He got up aII upset and said, ''I don't care what you think.

1101
01:18:22,538 --> 01:18:25,701
I've thought about it a Iong time. That's the name I'm gonna use.''

1102
01:18:25,875 --> 01:18:29,106
Did you feeI Iike he'd been thinking about it a Iong time?

1103
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:32,544
He was raw about Iosing his job at the schooI.

1104
01:18:32,715 --> 01:18:35,684
He taIked about shooting out the tires of a schooI bus...

1105
01:18:35,852 --> 01:18:38,150
...and picking off the ''IittIe darIings.''

1106
01:18:38,321 --> 01:18:41,984
- He actuaIIy used those words? - That's what made me remember.

1107
01:18:42,158 --> 01:18:46,686
Afterwards, I toId my wife I didn't wanna see him again. And I haven't since.

1108
01:18:46,863 --> 01:18:49,024
Other thing is, Leigh's into skin diving.

1109
01:18:49,465 --> 01:18:51,592
He's been up to that Iake a bunch of times.

1110
01:18:51,768 --> 01:18:53,963
Lake Berryessa? Did you ever go with him?

1111
01:18:54,137 --> 01:18:57,698
CoupIe times. We went fishing by Putah Creek near there.

1112
01:18:57,874 --> 01:19:02,004
- TeII him when you put it together. - About a year ago, in the paper...

1113
01:19:02,178 --> 01:19:04,544
...there was a story about the Zodiac.

1114
01:19:04,714 --> 01:19:07,376
And it aII comes back. I tried to caII the IocaI cops- - 

1115
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:10,542
- BIew him off. Thought he was a nut. - And you're sure...

1116
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:13,052
...the conversation you had about Zodiac...

1117
01:19:13,222 --> 01:19:17,124
...took pIace on January 1 st, 1 968?

1118
01:19:17,293 --> 01:19:18,851
It couIdn't have been any Iater.

1119
01:19:19,028 --> 01:19:23,829
I started a new job in L.A. on January 20th. I had to move.

1120
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,491
- This is my problem. This guy.... - Arthur Leigh Allen?

1121
01:19:26,669 --> 01:19:30,662
This guy just Iays out his entire eviI pIan to a fishing buddy on New Year's Day?

1122
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,138
I don't know. He's angry. He's been drinking.

1123
01:19:33,309 --> 01:19:35,800
Been thinking about it for a whiIe. I can buy that.

1124
01:19:35,978 --> 01:19:38,208
So why didn't Cheney contact us sooner?

1125
01:19:38,381 --> 01:19:39,871
I checked. He did.

1126
01:19:40,049 --> 01:19:43,177
First recorded contact with the poIice department about AIIen...

1127
01:19:43,353 --> 01:19:46,914
...was in Pomona, January 1 0th, 1 970. He just got Iost in the shuffIe.

1128
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:50,184
Did Cheney have anything against AIIen? Did AIIen screw his wife?

1129
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:55,093
We're gonna do a fuII background check. But I gotta teII you, I Iike this guy.

1130
01:19:55,698 --> 01:19:57,859
So Iet's puII some handwriting sampIes.

1131
01:19:59,369 --> 01:20:02,634
Hi. I taIked to Sherwood. He got the sampIes.

1132
01:20:02,805 --> 01:20:05,239
- What are you having? - BLT.

1133
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:09,943
The check stubs are a wash. There's not enough handwriting.

1134
01:20:10,113 --> 01:20:12,775
The appIication's got more, but he can't ruIe him in.

1135
01:20:12,949 --> 01:20:14,610
But he can't ruIe him out, either.

1136
01:20:14,784 --> 01:20:18,117
- WeII, that's vague. - He needs more sampIes.

1137
01:20:18,654 --> 01:20:23,148
AIso, our guy is a pervert. When MeI got the appIication from VaIIey Springs...

1138
01:20:23,326 --> 01:20:25,988
...they toId him AIIen had been fired for touching kids.

1139
01:20:26,162 --> 01:20:29,256
- ''Touching''? - PoIite euphemism.

1140
01:20:29,999 --> 01:20:33,264
- So, what do you wanna do? - Make some phone caIIs.

1141
01:20:33,436 --> 01:20:35,927
- Are you done with the fries? - Go ahead.

1142
01:20:36,105 --> 01:20:39,836
Did you have a chance to look at the copies of the Zodiac letters we sent?

1143
01:20:40,009 --> 01:20:43,410
Yeah. Some of this stuff is pretty creepy.

1144
01:20:43,579 --> 01:20:45,911
- Yeah, we know. - I mean creepy Iike Leigh.

1145
01:20:46,082 --> 01:20:48,710
He misspeIIs words Iike that. He thinks it's funny.

1146
01:20:48,885 --> 01:20:50,318
What about the handwriting?

1147
01:20:50,486 --> 01:20:53,284
I don't know. Don't you have experts for that stuff?

1148
01:20:53,456 --> 01:20:56,448
Our man at Questioned Documents says it's inconcIusive.

1149
01:20:56,626 --> 01:20:58,526
Maybe he did it with his other hand.

1150
01:20:58,694 --> 01:21:02,562
The letters are too neat for someone to have written with the wrong hand.

1151
01:21:02,732 --> 01:21:05,132
- But not for Leigh, right? - What do you mean?

1152
01:21:05,301 --> 01:21:09,829
He's ambidextrous. He can write with either hand. Didn't you guys know that?

1153
01:21:10,006 --> 01:21:12,338
In everyday Iife, AIIen uses his Ieft hand.

1154
01:21:12,508 --> 01:21:15,341
Job appIications, Ietters to friends, et cetera.

1155
01:21:15,511 --> 01:21:18,173
But he writes the Zodiac Ietters with his right hand...

1156
01:21:18,347 --> 01:21:21,976
...producing a different handwriting that he can't be Iinked to.

1157
01:21:22,151 --> 01:21:24,415
- We gotta see this guy, chief. - Where is he?

1158
01:21:24,587 --> 01:21:28,318
VaIIejo. He works at Union OiI in PinoIe. His brother's up there too.

1159
01:21:28,491 --> 01:21:32,257
See them both. Make sure you caII MuIanax. It is his backyard.

1160
01:21:32,428 --> 01:21:35,454
Oh, right, because that worked so weII for us in Riverside.

1161
01:21:35,731 --> 01:21:38,256
Cooperation, that's us, at aII costs.

1162
01:21:48,244 --> 01:21:49,871
You can taIk to him in here.

1163
01:21:50,046 --> 01:21:52,571
Coke machine's busted, by the way.

1164
01:21:53,182 --> 01:21:55,150
I'II go get him for you.

1165
01:21:56,352 --> 01:21:58,650
So how do you guys wanna do this?

1166
01:21:58,821 --> 01:22:01,654
WeII, BiII taIked to the informants. He Ieads, we foIIow?

1167
01:22:02,458 --> 01:22:04,187
It's okay by me.

1168
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:21,603
Mr. AIIen, I'm Inspector BiII Armstrong. This is Inspector Dave Toschi...

1169
01:22:21,777 --> 01:22:23,438
...and Sergeant Jack MuIanax.

1170
01:22:23,613 --> 01:22:27,811
We're investigating the Zodiac murders in San Francisco and VaIIejo.

1171
01:22:28,284 --> 01:22:30,013
PIease sit down.

1172
01:22:38,628 --> 01:22:41,290
The informant notified us you made certain statements...

1173
01:22:41,464 --> 01:22:43,955
...eIeven months prior to the first Zodiac murder.

1174
01:22:44,133 --> 01:22:46,658
If they're true, they're quite incriminating.

1175
01:22:46,836 --> 01:22:49,828
- You recaII having any such conversation? - No.

1176
01:22:50,006 --> 01:22:52,600
Have you ever read or heard anything about the Zodiac?

1177
01:22:52,775 --> 01:22:55,903
When it was first in the paper, but I didn't foIIow it after.

1178
01:22:56,078 --> 01:22:57,477
Why not?

1179
01:22:57,647 --> 01:22:59,444
Too morbid.

1180
01:22:59,615 --> 01:23:01,708
I toId aII this to the other officer.

1181
01:23:02,652 --> 01:23:04,916
- Which other officer? - From VaIIejo.

1182
01:23:06,255 --> 01:23:07,847
Do you remember his name?

1183
01:23:08,024 --> 01:23:11,357
No, but it was right after the murder at the Iake.

1184
01:23:11,527 --> 01:23:13,995
And what did you teII this officer?

1185
01:23:15,932 --> 01:23:20,631
I toId him that I'd gone to SaIt Point that weekend to skin dive...

1186
01:23:20,803 --> 01:23:23,499
...that I was aIone but I met a coupIe there.

1187
01:23:23,973 --> 01:23:26,134
I have their names at home if you want them.

1188
01:23:26,309 --> 01:23:29,244
- That wouId be great, Arthur. - Leigh.

1189
01:23:29,412 --> 01:23:34,111
- What? - Leigh. Nobody caIIs me Arthur.

1190
01:23:35,051 --> 01:23:38,179
AIso, that day when I came home, my neighbor saw me.

1191
01:23:38,354 --> 01:23:42,381
It was around 4. But I forgot to teII the other officer that.

1192
01:23:42,558 --> 01:23:45,186
- Neighbor's name? - BiII White.

1193
01:23:46,395 --> 01:23:48,295
He died a week or so afterwards.

1194
01:23:48,464 --> 01:23:51,831
Heart attack. So I didn't think to caII to foIIow up.

1195
01:23:53,769 --> 01:23:56,237
The knives I had in my car with the bIood on them...

1196
01:23:56,405 --> 01:23:59,203
...that bIood came from a chicken that I kiIIed for dinner.

1197
01:24:02,545 --> 01:24:05,275
- What? - I had knives in my car that weekend.

1198
01:24:05,448 --> 01:24:09,782
Maybe BiII saw them and caIIed the other officer on me.

1199
01:24:10,486 --> 01:24:12,886
WeII, we'II be checking in on that.

1200
01:24:13,055 --> 01:24:14,955
WeII, Iet me ask you something eIse.

1201
01:24:15,124 --> 01:24:19,493
Were you ever in Southern CaIifornia at any time in 1 966?

1202
01:24:19,662 --> 01:24:21,687
Is this about the Riverside kiIIing?

1203
01:24:21,864 --> 01:24:23,559
Yes.

1204
01:24:23,733 --> 01:24:27,533
WeII, I guess I was there around that time. I used to go down there a Iot.

1205
01:24:27,703 --> 01:24:30,035
I Iike the auto races.

1206
01:24:33,709 --> 01:24:36,143
Informant says that you're ambidextrous?

1207
01:24:36,312 --> 01:24:38,041
No, that's untrue.

1208
01:24:38,214 --> 01:24:40,580
You can't write with both hands?

1209
01:24:41,784 --> 01:24:44,048
My teachers tried to make me when I was a kid...

1210
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:46,882
...but I couIdn't. I'm Ieft- handed.

1211
01:24:47,056 --> 01:24:50,492
He aIso said that you made statements about kiIIing schooI chiIdren.

1212
01:24:51,994 --> 01:24:54,224
That is- - That is horribIe.

1213
01:24:54,397 --> 01:24:56,831
That is- - That's a horribIe thing to say.

1214
01:24:56,999 --> 01:25:00,093
So you weren't angry about being fired from VaIIey Springs...

1215
01:25:00,269 --> 01:25:02,237
...for touching your students?

1216
01:25:11,814 --> 01:25:14,146
I'm not the Zodiac.

1217
01:25:14,517 --> 01:25:17,714
And if I was, I certainIy wouIdn't teII you.

1218
01:25:20,022 --> 01:25:22,252
That's a nice watch.

1219
01:25:23,325 --> 01:25:25,384
- Thank you. - May I see it?

1220
01:25:27,863 --> 01:25:29,524
May I see it?

1221
01:25:40,743 --> 01:25:41,903
Where'd you get it?

1222
01:25:43,245 --> 01:25:45,406
A Christmas gift from my mother two years ago.

1223
01:25:45,581 --> 01:25:47,014
That's very sweet.

1224
01:25:47,216 --> 01:25:49,548
So teII me something, Arthur. You don't remember anyone...

1225
01:25:50,052 --> 01:25:54,749
...you might have had a conversation with regarding Zodiac?

1226
01:25:56,325 --> 01:26:02,628
Maybe Ted Kidder or PhiI Tucker at VaIIejo Recreation.

1227
01:26:02,898 --> 01:26:06,834
But I couIdn't be positive. I used to work there- - 

1228
01:26:10,706 --> 01:26:13,266
The Most Dangerous Game.

1229
01:26:14,243 --> 01:26:16,177
- What? - The Most Dangerous Game.

1230
01:26:16,345 --> 01:26:19,837
That's why you're here, isn't it? It was my favorite book in high schooI.

1231
01:26:20,015 --> 01:26:23,507
It's about this man who waits for peopIe to get shipwrecked on his isIand.

1232
01:26:23,686 --> 01:26:27,019
He was tired of hunting animaIs, he hunted peopIe for the chaIIenge.

1233
01:26:27,189 --> 01:26:30,522
And ''Man is the most dangerous animaI of aII''?

1234
01:26:31,427 --> 01:26:33,520
That's the whoIe point of the story.

1235
01:26:34,563 --> 01:26:35,928
Great book.

1236
01:26:37,133 --> 01:26:39,795
Or at Ieast that's what I toId PhiI.

1237
01:26:45,407 --> 01:26:47,272
May I go?

1238
01:26:50,312 --> 01:26:51,677
Sure.

1239
01:26:56,218 --> 01:27:00,052
- Thanks for your time. - I'm wiIIing to heIp in any way possibIe.

1240
01:27:00,623 --> 01:27:02,488
I Iook forward to the day...

1241
01:27:02,658 --> 01:27:06,389
...when poIice officers are no Ionger referred to as ''pigs.''

1242
01:27:07,196 --> 01:27:08,925
Thanks.

1243
01:27:09,498 --> 01:27:10,988
We'II be in touch.

1244
01:27:22,912 --> 01:27:26,643
So does anyone think this suspect warrants further investigation?

1245
01:27:26,982 --> 01:27:30,042
These are copies of some of the Zodiac Ietters that were sent.

1246
01:27:31,654 --> 01:27:33,349
We'd Iike you to take a Iook at them.

1247
01:27:33,856 --> 01:27:35,881
You think my brother's the Zodiac.

1248
01:27:36,058 --> 01:27:39,323
- WeII, we're Iooking at him. - Are you going to arrest him?

1249
01:27:39,495 --> 01:27:43,261
Mrs. AIIen, we don't arrest peopIe just because we're interested in them.

1250
01:27:43,432 --> 01:27:47,095
- WeII, Leigh's aIways been troubIed. - Is it true about the chiIdren?

1251
01:27:47,770 --> 01:27:51,706
UnfortunateIy. We don't see him much anymore since we found out.

1252
01:27:51,874 --> 01:27:54,138
What are your feeIings about Don Cheney?

1253
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:57,575
Don Cheney? My oId roommate? Was he the one who contacted you?

1254
01:27:57,746 --> 01:28:01,045
- That's confidentiaI. - WeII, Don's a very reIiabIe guy.

1255
01:28:01,217 --> 01:28:04,380
If he were to teII you something, I'd beIieve it to be true.

1256
01:28:04,553 --> 01:28:05,747
- This one. - What about it?

1257
01:28:05,921 --> 01:28:07,912
Here, he speIIs Christmas with two S's.

1258
01:28:08,090 --> 01:28:12,117
We got a Christmas card from Leigh years ago. He speIIed it the same way.

1259
01:28:12,294 --> 01:28:14,694
- ''Christ- mass.'' - WouId you stiII have that?

1260
01:28:14,864 --> 01:28:17,594
- I can Iook for it. - Thank you. That'd be great.

1261
01:28:19,168 --> 01:28:21,159
Is there anything eIse we can do to heIp?

1262
01:28:21,337 --> 01:28:24,170
Brother said he'd search Leigh's apartment next time he went.

1263
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:26,672
- Gets you around the warrant. - For the time being.

1264
01:28:26,842 --> 01:28:28,173
If we do find something...

1265
01:28:28,344 --> 01:28:31,780
...MuIanax wiII go to the DA and we couId search the pIace properIy.

1266
01:28:31,947 --> 01:28:35,974
I taIked to the cop who interviewed AIIen two days after the Berryessa murders.

1267
01:28:36,151 --> 01:28:39,951
Doesn't remember how he got onto him, but didn't think he Iooked Iike a kiIIer...

1268
01:28:40,122 --> 01:28:42,283
- ...so he didn't Iike him for Z. - But you do?

1269
01:28:42,458 --> 01:28:45,723
- I wish I couId've taken the guy in there. - Take it sIow, Dave.

1270
01:28:45,895 --> 01:28:49,387
Find more stuff for Sherwood. A match wiII get us farther on the warrants.

1271
01:28:49,565 --> 01:28:52,557
- Avery's on 2. - TeII him to screw.

1272
01:28:52,735 --> 01:28:56,671
You want me to communicate that verbatim or can I spice it up a IittIe?

1273
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:08,204
Christ, kid.

1274
01:29:09,834 --> 01:29:10,876
Yeah.

1275
01:29:10,876 --> 01:29:13,288
- Paul, I've been thinking... - Oh, God save us all.

1276
01:29:13,288 --> 01:29:14,750
The letter to Melvin Belli

1277
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:17,792
was sent exactly one year after the Lake Herman Road murder.

1278
01:29:17,792 --> 01:29:19,624
And the one to Cheri Jo Bates' father

1279
01:29:19,624 --> 01:29:22,086
was sent exactly six months after her death.

1280
01:29:22,086 --> 01:29:24,498
- She was killed a day before Halloween. - Yeah.

1281
01:29:24,498 --> 01:29:26,086
And you received a Halloween card...

1282
01:29:26,086 --> 01:29:28,792
You know, these are all fascinating pieces of news, Robert,

1283
01:29:28,792 --> 01:29:30,834
it's a bit early in the day.

1284
01:29:30,834 --> 01:29:33,708
Paul, it's 11:00 and we missed Editorial.

1285
01:29:38,288 --> 01:29:40,414
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you up. - No, no, no.

1286
01:29:40,414 --> 01:29:41,624
- I just thought that... - No, no, no.

1287
01:29:47,249 --> 01:29:50,150
This suspect is not your Zodiac.

1288
01:29:51,553 --> 01:29:54,920
This sampIe matches the canceIed checks and the appIication?

1289
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:57,251
- PerfectIy. - So we've retested the Ieft hand.

1290
01:29:57,425 --> 01:29:59,552
- We know he's ambidextrous. - In 38 years...

1291
01:29:59,728 --> 01:30:01,889
...I've never seen anyone that ambidextrous.

1292
01:30:02,063 --> 01:30:04,031
Both hands wouId have commonaIities.

1293
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:08,502
I'm sorry. Just not gonna work.

1294
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:12,737
- Homicide, Toschi. - Dave, it's Jack MuIanax.

1295
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:15,069
Right, MuIanax. Yeah?

1296
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:18,303
We struck out with the judge. He won't sign off on a warrant.

1297
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,141
- Why not? - Said it wasn't enough.

1298
01:30:20,315 --> 01:30:23,113
UnIess we bring him a handwriting match or some evidence- - 

1299
01:30:23,285 --> 01:30:25,185
WeII, how are we gonna get evidence?

1300
01:30:25,353 --> 01:30:27,082
I don't know.

1301
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:30,622
- I truIy am sorry. - No, I know. I thank you, Jack.

1302
01:30:32,127 --> 01:30:34,459
- What do you wanna do? - Don't know what I can do.

1303
01:30:34,629 --> 01:30:37,655
We need AIIen's right hand. We can't get it without a warrant.

1304
01:30:37,832 --> 01:30:39,959
Are there other guys you shouId be Iooking at?

1305
01:30:40,135 --> 01:30:43,366
- OnIy, what...? - Twenty- three hundred?

1306
01:30:44,005 --> 01:30:45,472
Okay, then.

1307
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:50,268
Okay, then.

1308
01:31:17,772 --> 01:31:20,468
PauI, you wrote the Justice Department...

1309
01:31:20,642 --> 01:31:24,237
...asking to be put in charge of the Zodiac investigation?

1310
01:31:26,281 --> 01:31:28,806
- I mereIy suggested- - - On our Ietterhead?

1311
01:31:28,984 --> 01:31:32,943
- - that those with knowIedge of the case create an information cIearinghouse...

1312
01:31:33,121 --> 01:31:35,453
...to promote an exchange and free fIow of ideas.

1313
01:31:35,623 --> 01:31:38,387
- And that you run it. - WeII, who better than me?

1314
01:31:39,694 --> 01:31:40,922
The marked man.

1315
01:31:41,930 --> 01:31:45,661
PauI, if you wanna work here, I need three things: One, stop boozing.

1316
01:31:45,834 --> 01:31:48,826
Two, stop doing whatever eIse it is you're doing.

1317
01:31:49,004 --> 01:31:52,235
And three, cut this nonsense out.

1318
01:31:52,407 --> 01:31:55,570
Sweetest of TempIetons, if at any time...

1319
01:31:55,744 --> 01:32:00,943
...you feeI my exceIIent work is no Ionger in step with this trashy provinciaI rag...

1320
01:32:01,116 --> 01:32:02,708
...I'II more than happiIy- - 

1321
01:32:02,884 --> 01:32:06,012
More than happiIy decamp for greener pastures.

1322
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:08,018
PauI, I mean it.

1323
01:32:18,133 --> 01:32:20,033
- PauI? - Yep?

1324
01:32:20,235 --> 01:32:21,702
What was that?

1325
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:24,236
An editoriaI tete- a- tete.

1326
01:32:24,406 --> 01:32:26,567
- Wanna grab a drink? - It's 1 0 in the morning.

1327
01:32:26,741 --> 01:32:31,440
- Late breakfast? EarIy Iunch, or.... - PauI.

1328
01:32:34,149 --> 01:32:35,810
Are you okay?

1329
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:37,882
No.

1330
01:32:41,022 --> 01:32:42,853
Thank you for asking.

1331
01:32:45,126 --> 01:32:46,286
- Shorty! - Yes?

1332
01:32:46,461 --> 01:32:49,396
- Let's go out for one. - PauI, where are you going?

1333
01:32:51,332 --> 01:32:53,061
So you moved off my brother- in- law?

1334
01:32:53,935 --> 01:32:56,028
We couIdn't get a warrant.

1335
01:32:57,772 --> 01:33:00,832
Last year we arranged for Leigh to get heIp from a sociaI worker.

1336
01:33:01,009 --> 01:33:05,708
He onIy went twice. We saw him recentIy for the first time in nine months.

1337
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:08,849
My mother- in- Iaw brought him by to see the new baby.

1338
01:33:09,017 --> 01:33:12,009
After he Ieft, I went to see that sociaI worker.

1339
01:33:12,187 --> 01:33:15,156
He couIdn't taIk about a former patient, so I just asked him...

1340
01:33:15,323 --> 01:33:17,951
...if he thought Leigh was capabIe of kiIIing peopIe.

1341
01:33:18,126 --> 01:33:21,459
- Because of patient confidentiaIity- - - The man said yes.

1342
01:33:23,198 --> 01:33:27,300
Why hadn't you seen him in nine months? He's going to schooI in Santa Rosa.

1343
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:30,871
- Santa Rosa? Where is he Iiving? - In his traiIer.

1344
01:33:31,039 --> 01:33:32,768
- In Santa Rosa? - Sonoma County.

1345
01:33:32,941 --> 01:33:35,136
We wouIdn't have to go through the VaIIejo DA.

1346
01:33:35,310 --> 01:33:38,336
It's been 1 1 months and now you wanna search his traiIer?

1347
01:33:38,513 --> 01:33:40,174
If we find something, great.

1348
01:33:40,348 --> 01:33:43,511
If not, we get his prints and handwriting sampIes from both hands.

1349
01:33:43,685 --> 01:33:45,710
I thought Sherwood shut you down.

1350
01:33:46,888 --> 01:33:49,049
What if I can get a second opinion?

1351
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:52,892
I don't wanna step on Sherwood's toes. He trained me.

1352
01:33:53,061 --> 01:33:55,791
AII I need to know is if the suspect is ambidextrous...

1353
01:33:55,964 --> 01:33:59,798
...couId he possibIy have written those Ietters with his other hand?

1354
01:34:01,102 --> 01:34:02,228
Between you and me?

1355
01:34:02,403 --> 01:34:05,804
Because there are differing schooIs of thought on this....

1356
01:34:07,509 --> 01:34:11,343
Get the sampIes of his other hand. If he's the Zodiac, you'II get a match.

1357
01:34:11,513 --> 01:34:14,311
That's the current thinking, according to Terry Pascoe.

1358
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:17,246
I spoke to a psychoIogist who'd be wiIIing to testify...

1359
01:34:17,418 --> 01:34:20,581
...that someone who undergoes a personaIity change Iike Zodiac...

1360
01:34:20,755 --> 01:34:23,588
...wouId manifest it physicaIIy, aItering his handwriting.

1361
01:34:23,758 --> 01:34:27,353
Which is why Sherwood couIdn't get a match from AIIen's sampIes.

1362
01:34:27,529 --> 01:34:29,690
We got Terry Pascoe, this psychoIogy guy...

1363
01:34:29,864 --> 01:34:32,560
...coupIed with Cheney, it couId be enough for a warrant.

1364
01:34:32,734 --> 01:34:34,065
Get Cheney on the record.

1365
01:34:34,288 --> 01:34:38,190
"And that he would call himself Zodiac."

1366
01:34:38,359 --> 01:34:40,759
Yes.And you're willing to swear to this,

1367
01:34:40,928 --> 01:34:42,862
under oath, in Superior Court?

1368
01:34:43,030 --> 01:34:44,361
Without any hesitation.

1369
01:34:44,532 --> 01:34:47,763
Thank you very much, Mr. Cheney. Thank you very much for your time.

1370
01:34:47,935 --> 01:34:48,120
Thank you.

1371
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:50,044
Suspect is Arthur Leigh Allen.

1372
01:34:50,044 --> 01:34:53,876
Lives in Sunset Trailer Court in Santa Rosa, California.

1373
01:34:53,876 --> 01:34:55,540
Physical description.

1374
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:57,876
Allen is similar in height, weight and build

1375
01:34:57,876 --> 01:35:01,086
to a man seen at Lake Berryessa on the day of the stabbings.

1376
01:35:01,086 --> 01:35:03,960
I understand he doesn't look much like the San Francisco composite.

1377
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:05,582
True. Height and weight are sketchy,

1378
01:35:05,624 --> 01:35:07,918
but lumbering Caucasian with a crew cut is right on.

1379
01:35:07,918 --> 01:35:10,288
We never had much confidence in the composite from the kids.

1380
01:35:10,288 --> 01:35:12,414
The patrolman who say Zodiac that night

1381
01:35:12,414 --> 01:35:13,960
said he didn't look much like the sketch.

1382
01:35:14,002 --> 01:35:15,540
Military boot prints.

1383
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:18,372
Allen was in the Navy. Wears a size 10- and- a- half.

1384
01:35:18,372 --> 01:35:20,918
Same size as the prints found at Berryessa.

1385
01:35:20,918 --> 01:35:22,708
What about gun?

1386
01:35:22,708 --> 01:35:27,372
Cheney says Allen owns several firearms. We'll list them in the warrant.

1387
01:35:27,372 --> 01:35:30,246
- And the ciphers. - Could be code training in the Navy,

1388
01:35:30,246 --> 01:35:33,086
and people have seen Allen with ciphers in the past.

1389
01:35:33,086 --> 01:35:34,204
Really? Who?

1390
01:35:34,204 --> 01:35:37,086
That would be his sister- in- law and a man named Phil Tucker

1391
01:35:37,086 --> 01:35:39,498
that he worked with at a public pool in Vallejo.

1392
01:35:39,498 --> 01:35:43,086
And Phil Tucker told us about a conversation that he had with Allen

1393
01:35:43,086 --> 01:35:45,876
about how to attach a flashlight to the barrel of a gun.

1394
01:35:45,876 --> 01:35:49,204
That gives us two sources on the ciphers and two on the flashlight.

1395
01:35:49,204 --> 01:35:51,330
What about his threats on children?

1396
01:35:51,330 --> 01:35:53,162
Suspect worked for elementary schools

1397
01:35:53,162 --> 01:35:56,498
and was fired for molestation in March, April '68.

1398
01:35:56,498 --> 01:35:59,204
- Could give him motive. - At the very least, it's home turf.

1399
01:35:59,204 --> 01:36:01,372
He'd have knowledge of bus routes,

1400
01:36:01,372 --> 01:36:03,918
which the two major threats centered around.

1401
01:36:03,918 --> 01:36:05,666
What about the bomb?

1402
01:36:07,086 --> 01:36:09,120
Allen works as a chemist.

1403
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:10,666
Take him through the geography.

1404
01:36:10,666 --> 01:36:12,246
Vallejo murders.

1405
01:36:12,246 --> 01:36:15,834
Allen lives in Vallejo with his mother in her basement.

1406
01:36:15,834 --> 01:36:19,120
Berryessa murder. On the day that the two kids were stabbed

1407
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:21,876
his neighbor saw bloody knives in his truck

1408
01:36:21,876 --> 01:36:24,876
which he claimed were used to kill a chicken.

1409
01:36:24,876 --> 01:36:26,834
Does he have any alibis?

1410
01:36:26,834 --> 01:36:29,582
He claimed he did, but he's been unable to produce the names

1411
01:36:29,582 --> 01:36:32,960
of the couple he supposedly met on the day of Berryessa.

1412
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:35,414
The bottom line is that Allen can't alibi up on anything.

1413
01:36:35,414 --> 01:36:37,330
Riverside, Vallejo, the lake or us.

1414
01:36:37,330 --> 01:36:39,624
- You want to tell me about the name? - What name?

1415
01:36:39,624 --> 01:36:40,834
Zodiac.

1416
01:36:40,834 --> 01:36:44,834
Allen wears a watch that bears both the word and crosshair symbol.

1417
01:36:44,834 --> 01:36:46,288
And he mentioned Zodiac to Cheney

1418
01:36:46,288 --> 01:36:48,876
a year and a half before it appeared in any letter.

1419
01:36:52,044 --> 01:36:54,582
- John... - That's pretty good, guys.

1420
01:36:54,582 --> 01:36:57,582
- We think so, too. - Let's take it to a judge.

1421
01:37:17,761 --> 01:37:19,092
Mr. AIIen? 

1422
01:37:19,262 --> 01:37:23,659
This is the Santa Rosa PoIice Department.We have a warrant to search your residence.

1423
01:37:34,978 --> 01:37:36,309
HeIIo?

1424
01:37:44,954 --> 01:37:46,854
I'II check with the neighbors.

1425
01:37:48,491 --> 01:37:49,981
- CIose the door. - CIose the door.

1426
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:52,219
There's rodents running around.

1427
01:38:04,874 --> 01:38:07,399
Neighbor said he tore out of here about haIf- hour ago.

1428
01:38:07,577 --> 01:38:11,069
- You think somebody tipped him? - We're not Ieaving tiII he comes back.

1429
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:18,951
I'II check the back.

1430
01:38:32,235 --> 01:38:33,964
- Jesus. - What?

1431
01:38:34,137 --> 01:38:35,570
SquirreIs.

1432
01:38:37,140 --> 01:38:38,630
Piece of work, this guy.

1433
01:38:45,949 --> 01:38:48,144
Not one, but two bIue windbreakers.

1434
01:38:48,318 --> 01:38:51,879
- Like the Stine scene? - We'II have those checked for bIood.

1435
01:38:52,989 --> 01:38:56,720
And a pair of bIack gIoves.

1436
01:38:57,127 --> 01:39:00,221
Men's 7, just Iike the ones we found in the cab.

1437
01:39:00,830 --> 01:39:03,264
WeII, he's got the same size shoes and gIoves as Z.

1438
01:39:03,433 --> 01:39:05,458
ProbabIy just a coincidence.

1439
01:39:05,635 --> 01:39:10,265
Dave, I got a gun. Check that. Two guns.

1440
01:39:11,074 --> 01:39:13,838
Both .22s. One automatic, one revoIver.

1441
01:39:14,010 --> 01:39:15,341
WeII, that's interesting.

1442
01:39:15,512 --> 01:39:18,640
Because he happens to have an M- 1 rifIe here in the cIoset.

1443
01:39:18,815 --> 01:39:21,340
For IittIe darIings bouncing off buses.

1444
01:39:22,886 --> 01:39:24,376
Someone's here.

1445
01:39:31,528 --> 01:39:34,725
HeIIo, Arthur. Remember us?

1446
01:39:56,486 --> 01:39:58,579
- No. - On the handwriting?

1447
01:39:58,755 --> 01:40:01,815
BaIIistics, no match. Prints, no match. Writing, no match.

1448
01:40:01,991 --> 01:40:05,927
On both hands, right? Because we got handwriting from both his hands.

1449
01:40:06,095 --> 01:40:07,426
And neither hand matches.

1450
01:40:07,597 --> 01:40:11,260
- Forget Sherwood. Get another opinion. - FeIIas, he's not your guy.

1451
01:40:17,874 --> 01:40:19,364
Damn it.

1452
01:40:26,416 --> 01:40:28,213
Hey.

1453
01:40:28,384 --> 01:40:29,942
What do you want?

1454
01:40:30,119 --> 01:40:31,677
Time off?

1455
01:40:33,022 --> 01:40:34,580
A hug?

1456
01:40:35,024 --> 01:40:37,015
Do you know what the worst part of this is?

1457
01:40:37,193 --> 01:40:40,924
I can't teII if I wanted it to be AIIen so bad because I thought it was him...

1458
01:40:41,097 --> 01:40:42,587
...or I want this to be over.

1459
01:40:42,765 --> 01:40:46,633
It's because you thought it was him. And I did too.

1460
01:40:48,872 --> 01:40:50,567
You know what? Take some time off.

1461
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:53,300
Spend some time with your wife and the kids.

1462
01:40:53,710 --> 01:40:57,077
Go to CandIestick. See a movie.

1463
01:40:59,482 --> 01:41:03,009
''To the city of San Francisco, I will enjoy killing one person every day...

1464
01:41:03,186 --> 01:41:06,246
...until you pay me $ 1 00,000.

1465
01:41:06,422 --> 01:41:09,755
If you agree, say so tomorrow morning...

1466
01:41:09,926 --> 01:41:12,827
...in the personal column San Francisco ChronicIe...

1467
01:41:12,996 --> 01:41:14,827
...and I will set up meeting.

1468
01:41:14,998 --> 01:41:16,829
If I do not hear from you...

1469
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:20,163
...it will be my next pleasure to kill a Catholic priest or a.... ''

1470
01:41:23,106 --> 01:41:25,040
''Scorpio. ''

1471
01:41:27,010 --> 01:41:28,637
Who's out of their minds?

1472
01:41:28,811 --> 01:41:30,244
I've gotta get out of here.

1473
01:41:30,413 --> 01:41:33,473
Where the hell does he expect me to find $ 1 00,000?

1474
01:41:33,650 --> 01:41:36,312
You're not thinking of paying him, are you, Mr. Mayor?

1475
01:41:36,486 --> 01:41:40,479
The city of San Francisco does not pay criminals not to commit crime.

1476
01:41:44,928 --> 01:41:49,490
- Chief, who's in charge of this? - Inspector Callahan. Waiting outside.

1477
01:42:03,746 --> 01:42:06,613
The kiIIer gets shot in the chest.

1478
01:42:06,783 --> 01:42:09,843
- That's how the- - That's how it ends. - Do I know you?

1479
01:42:10,019 --> 01:42:13,511
I'm Robert Graysmith. I work at the Chronicle with PauI Avery.

1480
01:42:13,690 --> 01:42:15,157
Dave Toschi. Nice to meet you.

1481
01:42:15,325 --> 01:42:17,816
That CaIIahan did a heII of a job with your case.

1482
01:42:17,994 --> 01:42:21,293
Yeah. No need for due process, right?

1483
01:42:24,934 --> 01:42:26,993
- What do you do? - I'm a cartoonist.

1484
01:42:27,170 --> 01:42:29,502
- That's nice. - You're gonna catch him.

1485
01:42:32,041 --> 01:42:34,669
PaI, they're aIready making movies about it.

1486
01:42:42,750 --> 01:42:45,792
We today have concluded an agreement

1487
01:42:45,792 --> 01:42:49,498
to end the war and bring peace with honor in Vietnam.

1488
01:42:49,498 --> 01:42:52,666
...Charles Manson for the Tate- La Bianca mass murders...

1489
01:42:52,666 --> 01:42:55,044
Guilty in the Chowchilla kidnapping case.

1490
01:42:55,044 --> 01:42:57,414
In the murder trial of one...

1491
01:42:57,414 --> 01:42:59,288
Chairman Mao died today...

1492
01:42:59,288 --> 01:43:01,792
...an absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon...

1493
01:43:01,792 --> 01:43:04,792
...an absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon...

1494
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:10,002
...has now led to the death of 50,000 Americans

1495
01:43:10,044 --> 01:43:13,044
and several hundred thousand Vietnamese...

1496
01:43:13,044 --> 01:43:15,876
Patricia Hearst is kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army...

1497
01:43:15,876 --> 01:43:19,204
All of us should stand up together and say, "No more."

1498
01:43:20,792 --> 01:43:23,540
Your Declaration of Independence spreads that...

1499
01:43:23,540 --> 01:43:26,246
Americans admire the United Kingdom...

1500
01:43:26,246 --> 01:43:28,372
Mr. Hoffa has disappeared.

1501
01:43:28,372 --> 01:43:31,918
If we despise our own government...

1502
01:43:32,834 --> 01:43:35,092
...that the police have captured a man

1503
01:43:35,092 --> 01:43:37,890
whom they believe to be the "Son of Sam..."

1504
01:43:52,342 --> 01:43:56,438
Hi. We haven't met. I'm Robert Graysmith.

1505
01:43:56,613 --> 01:43:58,478
I'm Duffy Jennings.

1506
01:43:58,649 --> 01:44:01,413
- Nice to meet you. - Good to meet you, man.

1507
01:44:01,819 --> 01:44:05,084
You got a great desk. Guy who used to work here was a great reporter.

1508
01:44:05,255 --> 01:44:09,157
Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm sure he was. I mean, it's a honor to Ieave the Chronicle...

1509
01:44:09,326 --> 01:44:11,590
...and go work for the Sacramento Bee.

1510
01:44:11,762 --> 01:44:14,060
Dare to dream, right, Robert?

1511
01:44:17,901 --> 01:44:20,495
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too.

1512
01:44:20,671 --> 01:44:23,003
I'm just right down there at the Art Department...

1513
01:44:23,173 --> 01:44:24,936
...if you need anything, Duffy.

1514
01:44:29,012 --> 01:44:31,776
- You sure you don't want the car, BiII? - It's your turn.

1515
01:44:31,949 --> 01:44:35,043
You couId just drop me off at my pIace and take the car.

1516
01:44:35,219 --> 01:44:37,050
You shouId keep the car.

1517
01:44:37,221 --> 01:44:38,518
Yeah?

1518
01:44:39,323 --> 01:44:41,291
I'm not coming in tomorrow.

1519
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,294
Why? What's up?

1520
01:44:46,330 --> 01:44:47,695
I'm done.

1521
01:44:48,866 --> 01:44:51,300
I put in for a transfer.

1522
01:44:57,007 --> 01:45:00,272
- Where? - Looking at Fraud.

1523
01:45:02,379 --> 01:45:04,973
I can't be on caII anymore.

1524
01:45:07,217 --> 01:45:10,118
I wanna see these kids grow up.

1525
01:45:10,554 --> 01:45:13,523
Hey, good for you, BiII.

1526
01:45:14,725 --> 01:45:17,717
- You'II be okay. - Yeah. I'II be fine.

1527
01:45:19,396 --> 01:45:20,761
Hey...

1528
01:45:21,632 --> 01:45:25,625
...I'm not Ieaving you hoIding the bag on anything, am I?

1529
01:45:26,703 --> 01:45:28,102
No.

1530
01:45:30,140 --> 01:45:31,630
Okay.

1531
01:45:31,808 --> 01:45:33,298
Hey, you know what?

1532
01:45:34,044 --> 01:45:38,003
Maybe you'II have a chance to try your Japanese food, the raw stuff.

1533
01:45:39,182 --> 01:45:40,649
Yeah.

1534
01:46:12,683 --> 01:46:14,947
''I'm not PauI Avery.''

1535
01:46:16,853 --> 01:46:19,845
The boys need to be tucked in and the baby needs changing.

1536
01:46:20,023 --> 01:46:23,117
- I'II fIip you for it. - You wish.

1537
01:46:25,929 --> 01:46:28,921
Nobody has more Zodiac crap than you do.

1538
01:47:13,210 --> 01:47:15,644
- Are you kidding me? - Hi, PauI.

1539
01:47:16,980 --> 01:47:19,244
Permission to come aboard.

1540
01:47:19,416 --> 01:47:22,317
Right there. You got shoes on. This is perfect right here.

1541
01:47:22,486 --> 01:47:24,886
- That's the one. - Okay.

1542
01:47:25,889 --> 01:47:27,618
See that? Mesmerizing.

1543
01:47:27,791 --> 01:47:31,887
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. My own kids wouId kiII me for one of those.

1544
01:47:33,263 --> 01:47:35,754
- How are you? - Fantastic.

1545
01:47:35,932 --> 01:47:40,130
I mean, admittedIy, the Bee ain't exactIy the Chron, but fuck it, right?

1546
01:47:40,303 --> 01:47:43,238
Do you want a drink? I don't have anything bIue, but I got....

1547
01:47:43,407 --> 01:47:45,500
Don't worry about that. Don't worry about it.

1548
01:47:45,675 --> 01:47:49,133
It's no bother at aII. Nobody comes by from the oId days.

1549
01:47:49,312 --> 01:47:50,574
Cheers.

1550
01:47:51,181 --> 01:47:53,547
To your heaIth and mine.

1551
01:47:55,285 --> 01:47:57,185
MostIy mine.

1552
01:48:05,562 --> 01:48:06,893
So, what's new?

1553
01:48:08,899 --> 01:48:11,925
I've been thinking. Somebody shouId write a book.

1554
01:48:12,102 --> 01:48:15,230
Somebody shouId write a fucking book, that's for sure.

1555
01:48:15,405 --> 01:48:17,965
- About what? - About Zodiac.

1556
01:48:18,909 --> 01:48:20,399
It's not new.

1557
01:48:20,577 --> 01:48:24,479
I've been thinking that if you put aII the information together...

1558
01:48:24,648 --> 01:48:27,640
...maybe you couId jog something Ioose. And I was thinking...

1559
01:48:27,818 --> 01:48:30,753
- ...you know the case best. - Yeah. That's true.

1560
01:48:30,921 --> 01:48:33,754
And you know aII the pIayers and you have aII the fiIes.

1561
01:48:33,924 --> 01:48:36,654
- Lost them. - You Iost them?

1562
01:48:36,827 --> 01:48:40,285
Or I tossed them. I don't know. I moved onto a boat.

1563
01:48:40,464 --> 01:48:43,524
You know that we work in the daiIy business, right? As in, today?

1564
01:48:43,700 --> 01:48:45,998
What do you think we were doing back then?

1565
01:48:47,704 --> 01:48:50,571
More peopIe die in the East Bay commute every three months...

1566
01:48:50,740 --> 01:48:52,207
...than that idiot ever kiIIed.

1567
01:48:52,375 --> 01:48:56,675
He offed a few citizens and he wrote a few Ietters and he faded into a footnote.

1568
01:49:02,619 --> 01:49:06,919
Not that I haven't been sitting here idIy waiting for you to drop by...

1569
01:49:07,090 --> 01:49:09,923
...and reinvigorate my sense of purpose.

1570
01:49:11,928 --> 01:49:14,522
It was four years ago. Let it fucking go.

1571
01:49:14,865 --> 01:49:17,993
You're wrong. It was important.

1572
01:49:19,169 --> 01:49:21,364
Then what did you ever do about it...

1573
01:49:22,439 --> 01:49:24,771
...if it was so important? What did you ever do?

1574
01:49:24,941 --> 01:49:27,466
You hovered over my desk, you stoIe from wastebaskets.

1575
01:49:27,644 --> 01:49:29,305
Am I being unkind?

1576
01:49:30,447 --> 01:49:34,679
Oh, that's right, I forgot. You went to the Iibrary.

1577
01:49:36,586 --> 01:49:38,645
I'm sorry I bothered you.

1578
01:50:00,510 --> 01:50:02,603
- Hey, hi. - Hi.

1579
01:50:02,779 --> 01:50:05,805
- Where you been? - The Iibrary.

1580
01:50:36,913 --> 01:50:38,574
Thank you.

1581
01:50:53,964 --> 01:50:57,695
- Inspector Toschi? - Yeah? One moment, pIease.

1582
01:51:01,705 --> 01:51:03,730
- Hi. - Hi.

1583
01:51:04,441 --> 01:51:06,170
We met at the movies once.

1584
01:51:06,776 --> 01:51:09,142
- It must have been magicaI. - I'm Robert Graysmith.

1585
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:12,645
I work at the Chronicle. I was wondering if I couId buy you Iunch.

1586
01:51:14,484 --> 01:51:15,746
Sure, why not?

1587
01:51:15,919 --> 01:51:18,820
So you're a friend of PauI Avery's?

1588
01:51:18,989 --> 01:51:21,287
He's actuaIIy the reason I'm here.

1589
01:51:22,892 --> 01:51:24,792
I wanted to ask you about Zodiac.

1590
01:51:25,662 --> 01:51:28,688
WeII, I appreciate the interest, but we don't discuss open cases.

1591
01:51:28,865 --> 01:51:31,163
Oh, weII, what's going on with it, day- to- day?

1592
01:51:31,334 --> 01:51:33,632
We're activeIy pursuing aII Ieads.

1593
01:51:33,803 --> 01:51:36,772
And you're the onIy one on it, right?

1594
01:51:37,207 --> 01:51:38,936
Mr. Graysmith...

1595
01:51:39,509 --> 01:51:41,500
...Zodiac hasn't written in three years.

1596
01:51:41,678 --> 01:51:44,476
You know how many murders we've had in San Francisco since?

1597
01:51:44,648 --> 01:51:46,138
- No. - Over 200.

1598
01:51:46,316 --> 01:51:49,342
That's a Iot of dead peopIe and grieving famiIies that need heIp.

1599
01:51:49,519 --> 01:51:51,043
So nobody cares.

1600
01:51:51,221 --> 01:51:54,156
Excuse me? I care.

1601
01:51:56,493 --> 01:51:58,723
Okay. Can I show you something?

1602
01:52:01,665 --> 01:52:04,793
I've been doing research on the first cipher.

1603
01:52:04,968 --> 01:52:09,905
Everything an amateur wouId need to create it can be found in these books.

1604
01:52:10,073 --> 01:52:13,270
Now, I started thinking that if you can track these books...

1605
01:52:13,443 --> 01:52:15,377
...then maybe you couId track the man.

1606
01:52:16,279 --> 01:52:19,009
So I remember you thought that Zodiac was miIitary...

1607
01:52:19,182 --> 01:52:22,743
...so I went to every base Iibrary and I got a Iist of every person...

1608
01:52:22,919 --> 01:52:26,912
...who's ever checked out these books and that's when I found this.

1609
01:52:31,761 --> 01:52:34,252
- Missing. - It means they were stoIen.

1610
01:52:34,864 --> 01:52:38,561
So aImost every book on ciphers was stoIen from the Presidio Library?

1611
01:52:38,735 --> 01:52:40,828
And the OakIand Army TerminaI Library.

1612
01:52:44,140 --> 01:52:47,871
Somebody didn't want a record of ever having checked out these books.

1613
01:52:48,712 --> 01:52:50,737
Who are you again?

1614
01:52:52,449 --> 01:52:54,508
I just wanna heIp.

1615
01:52:57,287 --> 01:52:59,312
I can't aIIow you to heIp.

1616
01:52:59,489 --> 01:53:02,583
I can't discuss the case with you. I can't give you information...

1617
01:53:02,759 --> 01:53:06,525
...and I certainIy couIdn't teII you to go see Ken NarIow in Napa.

1618
01:53:06,696 --> 01:53:08,027
N- A- R- L- O- W.

1619
01:53:18,074 --> 01:53:22,943
I'm sorry, Mr. Graysmith, but we don't cooperate with writers.

1620
01:53:23,113 --> 01:53:25,240
WeII, I'm not a writer, I'm a cartoonist.

1621
01:53:26,649 --> 01:53:28,810
- And Dave Toschi sent you? - Yes.

1622
01:53:28,985 --> 01:53:30,714
- Why? - Maybe he- - 

1623
01:53:30,887 --> 01:53:33,048
Maybe he thought that I couId do some good.

1624
01:53:34,457 --> 01:53:39,224
- What are you, some kind of boy scout? - EagIe Scout, actuaIIy. First cIass.

1625
01:53:39,662 --> 01:53:42,631
WeII, if you wanna do this, don't Iet me stop you.

1626
01:53:43,933 --> 01:53:46,299
Better start with VaIIejo, Jack MuIanax.

1627
01:53:47,070 --> 01:53:49,265
I understand what you're trying to do...

1628
01:53:49,439 --> 01:53:51,669
...but this is an open poIice investigation.

1629
01:53:51,841 --> 01:53:54,002
I'm a friend of Dave Toschi's.

1630
01:53:54,177 --> 01:53:57,203
And he said that you might be abIe to heIp.

1631
01:53:57,714 --> 01:54:01,275
I mean, the case is dead. Zodiac's Iong gone.

1632
01:54:01,451 --> 01:54:03,681
He's yesterday's news, right?

1633
01:54:04,621 --> 01:54:06,418
That's what they say.

1634
01:54:07,223 --> 01:54:09,157
So, what's the harm?

1635
01:54:09,325 --> 01:54:10,849
No pens, no paper.

1636
01:54:11,027 --> 01:54:13,860
Anything that's reIevant, you better remember in your head.

1637
01:54:14,030 --> 01:54:15,361
Okay.

1638
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:19,368
- Okay, here we go. - Which one?

1639
01:54:19,536 --> 01:54:23,433
AII of them. There's more in the next room. They're aII marked with these numbers.

1640
01:54:23,540 --> 01:54:26,634
- ''243- 1 46.'' - You don't smoke, do you?

1641
01:54:26,943 --> 01:54:29,969
Once. In high schooI.

1642
01:54:32,482 --> 01:54:33,972
Let me see this.

1643
01:54:34,784 --> 01:54:36,684
Thank you.

1644
01:55:04,147 --> 01:55:05,808
Man, you really creeped us out.

1645
01:55:11,988 --> 01:55:13,649
''Nine millimeter. ''

1646
01:55:15,792 --> 01:55:18,920
''Said nothing and began firing. ''

1647
01:55:33,977 --> 01:55:37,845
''Darlene's sister, Linda. It was all just deep breathing. George. ''

1648
01:55:39,182 --> 01:55:41,377
''It was a strange man. George. ''

1649
01:55:43,253 --> 01:55:46,416
Thank you so much.

1650
01:55:46,589 --> 01:55:49,285
Oh, briefcase. Thanks.

1651
01:55:51,494 --> 01:55:53,758
- Hey, Jack. - Hey, Bawart.

1652
01:55:53,930 --> 01:55:55,625
- Who's that? - That's Graysmith.

1653
01:55:55,798 --> 01:55:59,199
Some cartoonist. Thinks he's gonna soIve the Zodiac.

1654
01:56:01,204 --> 01:56:02,296
WeII, good for him.

1655
01:56:02,605 --> 01:56:05,233
Traffic troubles won't be affecting very many commuters.

1656
01:56:05,408 --> 01:56:08,309
Highway 37, blocked between Navarro and Vallejo.

1657
01:56:08,478 --> 01:56:11,743
A gasoline tanker truck overturned tonight....

1658
01:56:32,835 --> 01:56:35,133
- Thank you for meeting me. - No. We're not meeting.

1659
01:56:35,305 --> 01:56:37,603
We're just two guys sitting on the same bench.

1660
01:56:37,774 --> 01:56:40,368
I've got five minutes. I've gotta get back to the HaII.

1661
01:56:40,543 --> 01:56:43,671
As far as you know, did anyone ever get in touch with Mageau...

1662
01:56:43,846 --> 01:56:46,508
...during your investigation and show him suspect photos?

1663
01:56:46,683 --> 01:56:47,672
Why?

1664
01:56:47,850 --> 01:56:50,785
He's the onIy surviving victim who saw Zodiac without a mask.

1665
01:56:50,954 --> 01:56:53,388
No, why are you asking me? That's VaIIejo's case.

1666
01:56:53,556 --> 01:56:55,990
PauI Stine is mine. You've got four minutes now.

1667
01:56:56,159 --> 01:56:58,627
Look, DarIene Ferrin was being foIIowed.

1668
01:56:58,795 --> 01:57:01,229
MuIanax says they found this guy, a George Waters?

1669
01:57:01,397 --> 01:57:05,060
He aIso said a Iot of admirers wouId come to the restaurant where she worked.

1670
01:57:05,234 --> 01:57:06,895
- She was popuIar. - Very.

1671
01:57:07,070 --> 01:57:10,062
Yeah, so she and her husband, they move into their new house.

1672
01:57:10,239 --> 01:57:12,434
And one night, they throw this painting party.

1673
01:57:12,609 --> 01:57:15,635
- What's a painting party? - A party where peopIe heIp you paint.

1674
01:57:15,812 --> 01:57:18,337
- Sounds Iike a terribIe party. - WeII, supposedIy...

1675
01:57:18,514 --> 01:57:20,709
...somebody who's not Waters shows up.

1676
01:57:20,883 --> 01:57:22,544
And DarIene is terrified of him.

1677
01:57:22,719 --> 01:57:24,653
So you think that DarIene knew Zodiac?

1678
01:57:24,821 --> 01:57:28,985
And if Zodiac knew DarIene, then maybe Mageau knows Zodiac.

1679
01:57:29,158 --> 01:57:30,853
Maybe. But Mageau's gone.

1680
01:57:31,027 --> 01:57:34,394
If you wanna connect DarIene to Zodiac, you'II have to find another way.

1681
01:57:34,564 --> 01:57:37,465
I have another way. Phone caIIs the night of DarIene's murder.

1682
01:57:37,634 --> 01:57:40,762
- Yeah, Zodiac caIIed the poIice. - No, there were four other caIIs.

1683
01:57:40,937 --> 01:57:44,304
Two to DarIene's house, DarIene's brother- in- Iaw and father- in- Iaw.

1684
01:57:44,474 --> 01:57:47,409
Just heavy breathing. They started around 1 :30 a.m.

1685
01:57:47,577 --> 01:57:51,138
And this was before anyone in the famiIy knew that DarIene had been shot.

1686
01:57:51,314 --> 01:57:53,373
- This was in the VaIIejo fiIes? - Yeah.

1687
01:57:53,549 --> 01:57:55,676
- Goddamn it. - It's more than just coincidence.

1688
01:57:55,852 --> 01:57:59,515
Somebody doesn't just randomIy prank phone caII a victim's entire famiIy...

1689
01:57:59,689 --> 01:58:01,520
...90 minutes after they were shot.

1690
01:58:01,691 --> 01:58:05,218
So either Zodiac shoots a random coupIe, then he recognizes DarIene....

1691
01:58:05,395 --> 01:58:07,329
Or DarIene was shot on purpose.

1692
01:58:07,497 --> 01:58:11,228
Either way, Zodiac had to have known DarIene.

1693
01:58:12,468 --> 01:58:14,766
That's good, Robert.

1694
01:58:14,937 --> 01:58:17,667
So I can't find Mageau, maybe I can find DarIene's sister.

1695
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:20,035
Maybe she can teII me who this mystery man is.

1696
01:58:20,209 --> 01:58:23,372
Try that. I've got to go. She's very cute.

1697
01:58:26,816 --> 01:58:31,116
You know, it's interesting that you shouId mention Zodiac caIIing peopIe at home.

1698
01:58:31,287 --> 01:58:34,279
- He did that in San Francisco once. - What? Who did he caII?

1699
01:58:34,457 --> 01:58:37,984
I can't teII you. That's priviIeged information.

1700
01:58:38,828 --> 01:58:41,023
But maybe MeIvin BeIIi couId.

1701
01:58:43,966 --> 01:58:48,096
MeIvin BeIIi. How do I get to MeIvin BeIIi?

1702
01:58:48,705 --> 01:58:51,196
- He shouId be aIong soon. - Oh, that's aII right.

1703
01:58:51,374 --> 01:58:55,807
I've reaIIy onIy been waiting two hours.... He's usuaIIy not this Iate.

1704
01:58:55,912 --> 01:58:59,143
Oh, cookies. Thank you. These Iook great.

1705
01:58:59,348 --> 01:59:01,213
You are here on business?

1706
01:59:01,384 --> 01:59:03,409
I'm writing a book about the Zodiac.

1707
01:59:03,586 --> 01:59:06,146
I remember that. I spoke to him.

1708
01:59:06,322 --> 01:59:10,986
- You mean to Mr. BeIIi about the case? - No, to the Zodiac when he caIIed.

1709
01:59:11,160 --> 01:59:14,220
He said he had to kiII because it was his birthday.

1710
01:59:14,397 --> 01:59:17,457
He said it.... Wait, he said it was his birthday?

1711
01:59:17,633 --> 01:59:20,500
Yes. You want something to drink?

1712
01:59:21,871 --> 01:59:23,566
When was this?

1713
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:26,538
So many years ago.

1714
01:59:27,076 --> 01:59:31,172
Mr. BeIIi was away for Christmas. Gone for a week.

1715
01:59:31,347 --> 01:59:33,815
The Zodiac caIIed, wanting to taIk to him.

1716
01:59:33,983 --> 01:59:35,314
I said, ''He is not here.''

1717
01:59:35,485 --> 01:59:38,079
He said, ''I have to kiII. Today is my birthday.''

1718
01:59:38,254 --> 01:59:40,279
And then he hangs up.

1719
01:59:40,456 --> 01:59:42,014
Then the Ietter arrived.

1720
01:59:42,191 --> 01:59:46,321
So the caII came before the Ietter of December 20th.

1721
01:59:46,496 --> 01:59:48,293
Mr. BeIIi was gone for a week?

1722
01:59:48,464 --> 01:59:52,127
He came back on Christmas. Not a good day to work.

1723
01:59:52,301 --> 01:59:53,928
So he Ieft on the 1 8th.

1724
01:59:55,404 --> 01:59:58,271
- Is that heIpfuI? - She said it was his birthday.

1725
01:59:58,441 --> 02:00:01,035
Well, you have to confirm that, now wouldn't you?

1726
02:00:01,210 --> 02:00:03,678
How? How?

1727
02:00:03,846 --> 02:00:06,781
Well, I never spoke to her, but maybe my partner did.

1728
02:00:06,949 --> 02:00:09,941
- How do I get ahoId of him? - You don't. Bill wanted out of this.

1729
02:00:10,119 --> 02:00:12,212
As far as I'm concerned, he should stay out.

1730
02:00:12,388 --> 02:00:13,514
How do I confirm it?

1731
02:00:13,689 --> 02:00:16,317
Well, if my partner did talk to someone from Justice...

1732
02:00:16,492 --> 02:00:19,984
...they would've had to put that in a report. That's standard procedure.

1733
02:00:20,463 --> 02:00:22,431
- Okay. - Mel Nicolai.

1734
02:00:22,598 --> 02:00:24,828
- Thank you. - Goodbye.

1735
02:00:25,001 --> 02:00:27,299
- I just need to confirm a date. - Mr. Graysmith.

1736
02:00:27,470 --> 02:00:30,496
I've narrowed it down between the 1 8th and the 20th of December- - 

1737
02:00:30,673 --> 02:00:34,006
Okay, I'II pIay. Let's say this phone caII did take pIace.

1738
02:00:34,177 --> 02:00:38,273
Let's say it reaIIy was Zodiac. Why wouId he voIunteer the day he was born?

1739
02:00:38,447 --> 02:00:40,278
PIus, nobody died on December 1 8th...

1740
02:00:40,449 --> 02:00:43,907
...Iike nobody died over the weekend he was gonna kiII a dozen peopIe...

1741
02:00:44,086 --> 02:00:46,077
...or when he was gonna shoot schooI kids.

1742
02:00:46,255 --> 02:00:49,122
- He's a Iiar, Mr. Graysmith. - What if he made a mistake?

1743
02:00:49,425 --> 02:00:53,725
What if he wasn't Iying, if it was him? He didn't expect a nice person to pick up.

1744
02:00:53,896 --> 02:00:55,158
What if, what if, what if?

1745
02:00:55,331 --> 02:00:58,664
Look, off the record, BiII Armstrong checked this out.

1746
02:00:58,835 --> 02:01:01,303
We took this very seriousIy.

1747
02:01:01,470 --> 02:01:04,564
None of the suspects had the same birthday as this phantom caIIer.

1748
02:01:04,740 --> 02:01:07,072
BiII Armstrong.

1749
02:01:12,415 --> 02:01:16,511
Can I give you a piece of advice? You're Iooking in the wrong pIace.

1750
02:01:16,686 --> 02:01:19,553
Handwriting, fingerprints, that's what this thing's about.

1751
02:01:19,722 --> 02:01:20,950
Stick to the evidence.

1752
02:01:22,024 --> 02:01:23,457
Hey.

1753
02:01:31,367 --> 02:01:33,597
Hey. How was your day?

1754
02:01:33,769 --> 02:01:35,293
Long.

1755
02:01:39,809 --> 02:01:41,037
Who's Sherwood MorriII?

1756
02:01:41,210 --> 02:01:43,872
He's a handwriting expert in Sacramento.

1757
02:01:44,046 --> 02:01:47,413
He caIIed. He said he couId meet you tomorrow morning at 7.

1758
02:01:47,583 --> 02:01:48,914
Oh, great.

1759
02:01:49,085 --> 02:01:50,347
So you're taking off work?

1760
02:01:50,519 --> 02:01:52,612
Just an hour.

1761
02:01:53,456 --> 02:01:54,787
Sacramento's two hours away.

1762
02:01:56,893 --> 02:01:59,054
- ReaIIy? - Yes.

1763
02:01:59,228 --> 02:02:00,718
What's this?

1764
02:02:00,897 --> 02:02:03,331
Oh, that's the- - That articIe.

1765
02:02:03,499 --> 02:02:06,935
''Robert Graysmith has quietIy been shopping his book about the Zodiac.''

1766
02:02:07,103 --> 02:02:08,263
Yeah.

1767
02:02:08,437 --> 02:02:12,635
- It taIks aII about you researching Zodiac. - WeII, that's what the articIe's about.

1768
02:02:12,808 --> 02:02:14,799
I'm not sure we want peopIe to know that.

1769
02:02:14,977 --> 02:02:16,137
Why, are you embarrassed?

1770
02:02:16,312 --> 02:02:19,179
Robert, what's the one thing we know about Zodiac?

1771
02:02:20,283 --> 02:02:21,807
He reads the Chronicle?

1772
02:02:21,984 --> 02:02:24,782
Yeah, but he's never gonna read Herb Caen.

1773
02:02:28,691 --> 02:02:30,886
- HeIIo. - Mr. Graysmith?

1774
02:02:31,060 --> 02:02:33,551
The Robert Graysmith mentioned in the paper today?

1775
02:02:33,729 --> 02:02:34,889
Yeah?

1776
02:02:35,064 --> 02:02:37,897
I can tell you who the Zodiac is.

1777
02:02:40,736 --> 02:02:43,896
Who is this? The Zodiac Killer is obsessed with movies.

1778
02:02:44,006 --> 02:02:46,600
He recorded his murders on film.

1779
02:02:46,776 --> 02:02:49,939
I tried to tell the police, but they wouldn't follow through on it.

1780
02:02:50,112 --> 02:02:53,513
There's a man you need to find. His name is Bob Vaughn.

1781
02:02:53,683 --> 02:02:55,981
- Pen, pen. - V- A- U- G- H- N.

1782
02:02:56,152 --> 02:02:57,983
He's a friend of the Zodiac's.

1783
02:02:58,154 --> 02:03:00,486
Mr. Vaughn does not know his friend is a killer...

1784
02:03:00,656 --> 02:03:02,988
...and he's storing some film canisters for him.

1785
02:03:03,159 --> 02:03:05,059
In these canisters is the evidence.

1786
02:03:05,227 --> 02:03:08,390
Okay, yeah, friend? Who's his friend?

1787
02:03:08,564 --> 02:03:11,761
- You have quite enough to get started. - Oh, pIease.

1788
02:03:11,934 --> 02:03:16,234
The Zodiac's name is Rick Marshall.

1789
02:03:18,941 --> 02:03:21,136
Your toast is burning.

1790
02:03:22,111 --> 02:03:27,640
We choose at some point in our Iives how to physicaIIy construct each Ietter.

1791
02:03:27,817 --> 02:03:29,910
Once we Iock that into our brains...

1792
02:03:30,086 --> 02:03:32,452
...our handwriting may change over the years...

1793
02:03:32,621 --> 02:03:35,988
...but the moves themseIves remain unaItered. Understand?

1794
02:03:36,158 --> 02:03:37,625
Yes.

1795
02:03:38,327 --> 02:03:40,887
Except Zodiac's doesn't.

1796
02:03:42,098 --> 02:03:44,464
SpecificaIIy with his K.

1797
02:03:45,134 --> 02:03:47,864
In his first Ietters, he executed the K with two strokes.

1798
02:03:48,037 --> 02:03:50,835
- Later Ietters, he did them with three. - Why?

1799
02:03:51,007 --> 02:03:53,874
We don't know. Excuse me, I gotta spray this.

1800
02:03:54,043 --> 02:03:57,103
How many suspects were cIeared through handwriting?

1801
02:03:57,279 --> 02:04:02,182
AII of them. AIso the print in the cab. No match was ever found.

1802
02:04:02,351 --> 02:04:06,378
Is there any way that someone couId beat a handwriting test?

1803
02:04:06,555 --> 02:04:11,288
No. Whoever the Zodiac is, he's not someone I cIeared.

1804
02:04:11,894 --> 02:04:15,352
About a month ago, a man showed up on my doorstep very distraught.

1805
02:04:15,631 --> 02:04:18,122
Name was WaIIace Penny.

1806
02:04:18,300 --> 02:04:22,669
He said he knew who the Zodiac was. Gave me a name.

1807
02:04:22,838 --> 02:04:25,534
- Rick, Rick somebody. - Rick MarshaII?

1808
02:04:26,976 --> 02:04:30,002
- Yeah. - The man you taIked to caIIed me too.

1809
02:04:30,179 --> 02:04:34,775
After he Ieft, then I checked my fiIes. I never cIeared a Rick MarshaII.

1810
02:04:41,924 --> 02:04:43,414
HeIIo?

1811
02:04:48,197 --> 02:04:50,028
HeIIo. Who is this?

1812
02:04:59,909 --> 02:05:01,706
It's a wrong number.

1813
02:05:08,084 --> 02:05:11,076
Does the name Rick MarshaII mean anything to you?

1814
02:05:12,088 --> 02:05:15,285
- What are you after? - What do you got?

1815
02:05:15,458 --> 02:05:20,293
HypotheticaIIy, you just named my favorite suspect in the whoIe case.

1816
02:05:20,830 --> 02:05:24,664
This is off the record. CoupIe years back, I was trying to get MarshaII's prints.

1817
02:05:24,834 --> 02:05:27,064
I handed him a photo. He Iooks at it.

1818
02:05:27,236 --> 02:05:29,067
He's about to give it back and he says:

1819
02:05:29,238 --> 02:05:31,638
''My goodness, I got fingerprints aII over this.''

1820
02:05:31,807 --> 02:05:34,139
And he wipes them off.

1821
02:05:34,310 --> 02:05:36,175
Why didn't you test him for handwriting?

1822
02:05:36,345 --> 02:05:38,609
Because when they finaIIy did run his prints...

1823
02:05:38,781 --> 02:05:41,181
...they cIeared him against the one in Stine's cab.

1824
02:05:41,350 --> 02:05:43,250
- So it's not him. - Maybe yes, maybe no.

1825
02:05:43,419 --> 02:05:45,444
No. What do you mean?

1826
02:05:45,621 --> 02:05:47,680
Zodiac Ieft gIoves behind at the scene.

1827
02:05:47,857 --> 02:05:49,848
If he had the foresight to bring gIoves...

1828
02:05:50,025 --> 02:05:52,516
...how's he gonna accidentaIIy Ieave a print behind?

1829
02:05:52,695 --> 02:05:54,287
But it was in the victim's bIood.

1830
02:05:54,463 --> 02:05:58,456
CouId have been one of the bystanders or a cop just reaches out...faIse print.

1831
02:05:58,634 --> 02:06:00,727
But that print disquaIified 2500 suspects.

1832
02:06:00,903 --> 02:06:03,667
- Which is why we used handwriting. - But not for MarshaII.

1833
02:06:03,839 --> 02:06:06,672
S.F.P.D. saw a handwritten sign in the window of his house...

1834
02:06:06,842 --> 02:06:09,970
...decided it Iooked nothing Iike the Z Ietters, so they moved on.

1835
02:06:10,146 --> 02:06:12,637
How do they know that Rick MarshaII wrote the sign?

1836
02:06:12,815 --> 02:06:15,045
My thoughts exactIy.

1837
02:06:15,217 --> 02:06:17,310
Rick MarshaII was a Navy man.

1838
02:06:17,486 --> 02:06:21,422
He received code training. He was aIso a projectionist at a siIent- fiIm theater.

1839
02:06:21,590 --> 02:06:23,751
How do I get copies of MarshaII's handwriting?

1840
02:06:23,926 --> 02:06:27,521
Three ways. One, get a warrant, which you can't. Two, get him to voIunteer...

1841
02:06:27,696 --> 02:06:30,559
- ...which he won't. - Yeah, and three?

1842
02:06:31,934 --> 02:06:33,697
Get creative.

1843
02:06:33,869 --> 02:06:36,599
I don't know what to tell you. You get it, I'll analyze it.

1844
02:06:36,772 --> 02:06:40,367
- Beyond that, you're on your own. - What about the guy who saw you?

1845
02:06:40,543 --> 02:06:41,874
The one who caIIed me?

1846
02:06:42,044 --> 02:06:44,535
You mean Wallace Penny?

1847
02:06:44,713 --> 02:06:47,045
Yeah. Did he Ieave a number?

1848
02:06:55,925 --> 02:06:59,292
- Hello? - Hi, this is Robert Graysmith.

1849
02:06:59,461 --> 02:07:02,555
- How did you find me? - I need a sampIe of MarshaII's writing.

1850
02:07:02,731 --> 02:07:04,062
I told you. Vaughn is who- - 

1851
02:07:04,233 --> 02:07:06,895
Mr. Penny, if Rick MarshaII is the Zodiac...

1852
02:07:07,069 --> 02:07:09,560
...I need a sampIe of his handwriting to confirm it.

1853
02:07:09,738 --> 02:07:11,865
Can you heIp me or not?

1854
02:07:13,075 --> 02:07:17,569
Rick used to draw movie posters for the theater Vaughn worked at.

1855
02:07:17,813 --> 02:07:19,872
- I'll send one down. - Thank you.

1856
02:07:29,758 --> 02:07:30,850
I'II need more sampIes.

1857
02:07:31,026 --> 02:07:33,494
- Yeah, but is it- - ? - It's as cIose as I've ever seen.

1858
02:07:33,662 --> 02:07:37,291
Tread IightIy here. We're taIking about impIicating this man as the Zodiac.

1859
02:07:37,466 --> 02:07:40,435
I can get more. I'II just find Vaughn and I'II track down Linda.

1860
02:07:40,603 --> 02:07:43,970
I mean, Linda is DarIene's sister. I've been to the DMV...

1861
02:07:44,139 --> 02:07:48,337
...and I taIked to her parents, but stiII, nobody knows where to find her.

1862
02:07:48,510 --> 02:07:52,970
Mr. Graysmith, most of the writing matches the exempIar.

1863
02:07:53,148 --> 02:07:56,174
Though it's the part that doesn't match that scares me the most.

1864
02:07:56,352 --> 02:07:58,445
- What do you mean? - WeII, on the poster...

1865
02:07:58,621 --> 02:08:01,954
...the one Ietter that absoIuteIy, positiveIy does not match...

1866
02:08:02,124 --> 02:08:03,955
...is the Ietter K.

1867
02:08:05,628 --> 02:08:08,859
You wouIdn't happen to have any AnimaI Crackers in there, wouId you?

1868
02:08:09,698 --> 02:08:13,498
Unit 5, Toschi needs to call in on a landline.

1869
02:08:25,114 --> 02:08:27,378
- Dispatch. - Hey. Dave Toschi.

1870
02:08:27,549 --> 02:08:29,312
I'll connect you.

1871
02:08:29,885 --> 02:08:31,477
- Dave? - Yeah. What's up?

1872
02:08:31,654 --> 02:08:33,554
Jennings here from the Chronicle.

1873
02:08:33,722 --> 02:08:35,883
It came in this morning. You need to see it.

1874
02:08:36,058 --> 02:08:37,047
See what?

1875
02:08:37,226 --> 02:08:39,820
The new Zodiac letter. And it mentions you.

1876
02:08:39,995 --> 02:08:41,963
Okay, okay.

1877
02:08:43,232 --> 02:08:47,498
Shit. AII right, come on. HaII of Justice.

1878
02:08:47,736 --> 02:08:51,695
Now. Come on, come on, come on.

1879
02:08:57,179 --> 02:08:58,407
Dave.

1880
02:08:59,014 --> 02:09:01,039
Do you have it with you?

1881
02:09:04,586 --> 02:09:06,918
''This is the Zodiac speaking. I'm back with you.

1882
02:09:07,089 --> 02:09:10,024
TeII Herb Caen I am here, I have aIways been here.

1883
02:09:10,192 --> 02:09:13,025
That city pig Toschi is good, but I am smarter and better.

1884
02:09:13,195 --> 02:09:16,187
He wiII get tired, then Ieave me aIone.

1885
02:09:16,365 --> 02:09:19,027
I'm waiting for a good movie about me. Who wiII pIay me?

1886
02:09:19,201 --> 02:09:21,669
I'm now in controI of aII things.''

1887
02:09:21,837 --> 02:09:24,397
These guys are from InternaI Affairs.

1888
02:09:26,208 --> 02:09:28,073
We need to taIk.

1889
02:09:28,243 --> 02:09:29,574
Good evening. Our top story:

1890
02:09:29,745 --> 02:09:32,179
The San Francisco Police Department has confirmed...

1891
02:09:32,348 --> 02:09:36,409
...that the man who calls himself Zodiac and terrorized the Bay Area...

1892
02:09:36,585 --> 02:09:39,247
...has broken his silence of 5 1 months.

1893
02:09:39,421 --> 02:09:41,981
In a letter claiming, ''I am back with you''...

1894
02:09:42,157 --> 02:09:45,888
...the Zodiac makes no overt threats against the citizenry...

1895
02:09:46,061 --> 02:09:48,723
...and muses that his life would make the best movie yet.

1896
02:09:48,897 --> 02:09:50,956
These carrots are perfect.

1897
02:09:51,567 --> 02:09:53,398
- Just go. - This message also mentions...

1898
02:09:53,569 --> 02:09:55,969
...San Francisco ChronicIe columnist Herb Caen...

1899
02:09:56,138 --> 02:09:58,971
...and the department's own David Toschi by name.

1900
02:09:59,141 --> 02:10:00,199
May I be excused?

1901
02:10:00,376 --> 02:10:03,106
You have to come back and finish what's on that pIate.

1902
02:10:03,278 --> 02:10:05,940
Our team's coverage on the cipher slayer's return...

1903
02:10:06,115 --> 02:10:08,583
...begins as Alan Freeman has more.

1904
02:10:08,751 --> 02:10:12,016
Thank you, Eric. ChronicIe columnist Armistead Maupin said...

1905
02:10:12,187 --> 02:10:15,020
...that he thinks not only is this new letter a forgery...

1906
02:10:15,190 --> 02:10:19,354
...but it was written by the very man trusted to hunt down this killer...

1907
02:10:19,528 --> 02:10:22,964
...David Toschi. Maupin, a very well- respected author...

1908
02:10:23,132 --> 02:10:27,262
...has gone on record saying that he believes Toschi wrote the letter...

1909
02:10:27,436 --> 02:10:29,336
...to drum up publicity for himself.

1910
02:10:29,505 --> 02:10:32,599
Maupin used David as a character in his coIumn.

1911
02:10:32,775 --> 02:10:36,108
David got a kick out of it and wrote a coupIe of anonymous Ietters...

1912
02:10:36,278 --> 02:10:38,439
...asking for the character to be brought back.

1913
02:10:38,614 --> 02:10:41,777
It was like writing fan mail to himself. That's all.

1914
02:10:41,950 --> 02:10:44,111
But David did not write that letter.

1915
02:10:44,286 --> 02:10:47,278
No, I'm sure that he didn't. I'm sure this wiII aII bIow over.

1916
02:10:47,456 --> 02:10:48,616
''Blow over''?

1917
02:10:48,791 --> 02:10:50,850
They kicked him out of Homicide.

1918
02:10:51,026 --> 02:10:54,291
They made him give his handwriting Iike some common criminaI.

1919
02:10:54,463 --> 02:10:57,830
- May I taIk to him? - No.

1920
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:01,333
Can you just ask him if he ever investigated a man named Rick MarshaII?

1921
02:11:01,503 --> 02:11:03,494
Is that aII you can think about?

1922
02:11:03,672 --> 02:11:07,267
Mr. Graysmith, Maupin works at your paper. We trust- - 

1923
02:11:12,948 --> 02:11:16,679
- This girI, she wants music Iessons? - Dave. Dave.

1924
02:11:17,986 --> 02:11:20,318
- Okay, see you Iater. - I'II catch up to you.

1925
02:11:20,489 --> 02:11:22,650
You stop caIIing my house. Do you understand me?

1926
02:11:22,825 --> 02:11:24,452
I need your heIp to find Linda.

1927
02:11:24,626 --> 02:11:27,322
- Jesus. - Look, two seconds.

1928
02:11:28,664 --> 02:11:31,098
Look, we've been running handwriting sampIes.

1929
02:11:31,266 --> 02:11:33,359
- Who's we? - Sherwood and I.

1930
02:11:33,535 --> 02:11:36,766
Sherwood? Sherwood who was fired from Questioned Documents?

1931
02:11:36,939 --> 02:11:39,533
- Sherwood who drinks Iike PauI Avery? - He retired.

1932
02:11:39,708 --> 02:11:41,198
Is that what he toId you?

1933
02:11:41,376 --> 02:11:45,335
- What, are you saying he's wrong? - I'm saying stop caIIing my house.

1934
02:11:46,081 --> 02:11:47,912
- We ran them on MarshaII. - No, Robert.

1935
02:11:48,083 --> 02:11:51,712
- No, I know you don't think it's him. - I am not having this conversation.

1936
02:11:51,887 --> 02:11:54,151
And I can't taIk to Mageau or Linda, so I'm- - 

1937
02:11:54,323 --> 02:11:55,847
- Robert, stop it. - What? What?

1938
02:11:56,024 --> 02:11:59,687
The Rick MarshaIIs of this worId wiII suck you dry. They're bIind aIIeys.

1939
02:11:59,862 --> 02:12:02,854
But he said he wasn't gonna announce his murders anymore, Dave.

1940
02:12:03,031 --> 02:12:05,898
Do you know what the chances of us arresting someone are now?

1941
02:12:06,068 --> 02:12:10,061
Too much time has gone by, okay? Too much of the evidence is Iost.

1942
02:12:10,239 --> 02:12:13,140
PeopIe get oId, Robert. They forget.

1943
02:12:13,542 --> 02:12:17,569
Now, I have been a cop for 25 years. Murder poIice for 1 2.

1944
02:12:17,746 --> 02:12:19,543
- What do you do? - You know what I do.

1945
02:12:19,715 --> 02:12:22,309
- You're a cartoonist. - So, what are you saying?

1946
02:12:22,484 --> 02:12:26,580
I am saying Zodiac was my job. It is not yours.

1947
02:12:28,790 --> 02:12:31,224
- He's stiII out there. - No, I am through with this.

1948
02:12:31,393 --> 02:12:33,452
I am through with you.

1949
02:12:39,568 --> 02:12:42,230
What about September 26, 1 970?

1950
02:12:42,404 --> 02:12:46,397
- Okay, which one was that? - ''Lake Tahoe Nurse Goes Missing.''

1951
02:12:48,644 --> 02:12:52,045
- One day before the vernaI equinox. Dad? - Yeah. Mark that.

1952
02:12:52,214 --> 02:12:55,547
Oh, got another one. June 1 9th, 1 97 1 .

1953
02:12:55,717 --> 02:12:58,811
That's gotta be near the summer soIstice.

1954
02:13:00,956 --> 02:13:05,450
Oh, guys. Don't teII Mom about our speciaI project, okay?

1955
02:13:06,094 --> 02:13:09,461
How come you and Mom don't sIeep in the same bed anymore?

1956
02:13:13,635 --> 02:13:16,263
- HeIIo? - Mr. Graysmith, Ken Narlow from Napa.

1957
02:13:16,438 --> 02:13:20,431
Oh, Captain NarIow. Thank you for caIIing me back.

1958
02:13:20,609 --> 02:13:22,270
Yeah. How can I help?

1959
02:13:22,444 --> 02:13:25,311
I caIIed because we've been cross- referencing Iunar cycIes...

1960
02:13:25,480 --> 02:13:26,970
...with the Zodiac's timeIine.

1961
02:13:27,149 --> 02:13:30,676
More often than not, each cycIe since '69 corresponds with an attack...

1962
02:13:30,852 --> 02:13:34,117
...or with one of the Ietters or an unsoIved homicide.

1963
02:13:34,289 --> 02:13:37,156
- Who's working with you on this? - Some coIIeagues.

1964
02:13:37,326 --> 02:13:38,554
Dad?

1965
02:13:39,494 --> 02:13:41,928
- Ken, can you hoId on one second? - Dad?

1966
02:13:42,364 --> 02:13:44,355
- What is it? - What's this?

1967
02:13:48,136 --> 02:13:51,333
In the decade since the Zodiac's last cipher was received...

1968
02:13:51,506 --> 02:13:54,737
...every federal agency has taken a crack at decoding it.

1969
02:13:56,311 --> 02:14:00,213
But today, where those agencies had failed, a cartoonist has succeeded.

1970
02:14:00,382 --> 02:14:02,680
How did you do it?

1971
02:14:02,851 --> 02:14:05,945
Just a lot of books from the library...

1972
02:14:06,121 --> 02:14:09,784
...and I love puzzles, so I just....

1973
02:14:09,958 --> 02:14:12,153
Yeah. The fucking Iibrary.

1974
02:14:12,327 --> 02:14:15,319
I believe you can accomplish anything that you put your mind- - 

1975
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:21,800
That's a J? Okay. Honor Camp?

1976
02:14:22,571 --> 02:14:24,471
Thank you so much.

1977
02:14:26,008 --> 02:14:28,738
Hey, we found Linda. She's in jaiI. Isn't that great?

1978
02:14:28,910 --> 02:14:30,901
- Why'd you do it? - She'II identify Rick- - 

1979
02:14:31,079 --> 02:14:34,412
- What are you taIking about? - You went on TV.

1980
02:14:34,583 --> 02:14:37,910
You put yourseIf out there for him to see. You're being paranoid.

1981
02:14:38,020 --> 02:14:41,012
Then who's been caIIing our house in the middIe of the night?

1982
02:14:41,189 --> 02:14:43,316
Nobody, I- - 

1983
02:14:44,092 --> 02:14:47,289
- What's it gonna take for you to be done? - I can't taIk about this.

1984
02:14:47,462 --> 02:14:48,793
I have to go see Bob Vaughn.

1985
02:14:48,964 --> 02:14:52,058
WeII, that's too bad, because we're gonna taIk about this.

1986
02:14:52,234 --> 02:14:56,398
When is it gonna be finished? When you catch him, when you arrest him?

1987
02:14:56,571 --> 02:14:59,039
- Be serious. - I am serious.

1988
02:15:01,009 --> 02:15:05,343
I need to know who he is.

1989
02:15:05,947 --> 02:15:09,576
I need to stand there. I need to Iook him in the eye...

1990
02:15:09,751 --> 02:15:12,720
...and I need to know that it's him.

1991
02:15:13,355 --> 02:15:15,721
Is that more important than your famiIy's safety?

1992
02:15:15,891 --> 02:15:18,018
Of course not.

1993
02:15:19,394 --> 02:15:22,363
Why? Why do you need to do this?

1994
02:15:23,398 --> 02:15:24,831
Why?

1995
02:15:26,668 --> 02:15:28,295
Because nobody eIse wiII.

1996
02:15:28,470 --> 02:15:29,960
That's not good enough.

1997
02:15:30,772 --> 02:15:32,262
Are you done? Can I go?

1998
02:15:48,056 --> 02:15:50,081
- Mr. Vaughn? - Mr. Graysmith?

1999
02:15:50,258 --> 02:15:52,590
- Yes. - Hi. You needed to speak to me?

2000
02:15:52,761 --> 02:15:54,991
Yes. There's a coffee shop right on the corner.

2001
02:15:55,163 --> 02:15:58,257
- Why don't we just go to my home? - Oh, I don't wanna put you out.

2002
02:15:58,433 --> 02:16:01,163
It's no troubIe at aII. Where are you parked?

2003
02:16:01,336 --> 02:16:02,428
Just right there.

2004
02:16:02,604 --> 02:16:04,265
You can foIIow me?

2005
02:16:05,774 --> 02:16:07,002
Okay.

2006
02:16:24,826 --> 02:16:26,487
Watch your step.

2007
02:16:31,032 --> 02:16:34,297
- Very nice house. - Oh, thank you.

2008
02:16:34,469 --> 02:16:36,198
It's very rustic.

2009
02:16:36,371 --> 02:16:39,306
- Can I take your jacket? - No, thank you, I'm fine.

2010
02:16:39,474 --> 02:16:42,375
Okay. This way, pIease.

2011
02:16:44,379 --> 02:16:46,074
- Have a seat. - Thank you.

2012
02:16:46,248 --> 02:16:48,648
- How about some tea? - Oh, no, I'm aII right.

2013
02:16:48,817 --> 02:16:51,081
- You sure? - Yes.

2014
02:16:51,253 --> 02:16:54,882
I wanted to ask you about a fiIm that the Avenue may have pIayed...

2015
02:16:55,056 --> 02:16:59,186
...whiIe you were the organist there, The Most Dangerous Game?

2016
02:16:59,361 --> 02:17:02,660
It's a cIassic. RKO. 1 932.

2017
02:17:02,831 --> 02:17:07,359
Fay Wray, JoeI McCrea, LesIie Banks. We've run that picture many times.

2018
02:17:07,536 --> 02:17:09,231
In '68, '69?

2019
02:17:10,839 --> 02:17:12,807
I'd have to check my records. Why?

2020
02:17:12,974 --> 02:17:14,874
Do you remember the Zodiac?

2021
02:17:17,345 --> 02:17:19,609
This is about Rick MarshaII, isn't it?

2022
02:17:19,781 --> 02:17:23,512
- He was a projectionist there, right? - For a time, yes.

2023
02:17:23,685 --> 02:17:27,416
But I have no occasion to correspond with him these days.

2024
02:17:27,589 --> 02:17:29,853
Okay, weII, there is a connection...

2025
02:17:30,025 --> 02:17:32,585
...between one of the Zodiac attacks and that fiIm.

2026
02:17:32,761 --> 02:17:34,524
You mean the symboI?

2027
02:17:35,897 --> 02:17:37,592
HoId on.

2028
02:17:37,766 --> 02:17:42,760
The Zodiac symboI on fiIm. It's on the countdown.

2029
02:17:45,607 --> 02:17:48,337
It's trimmed off each reeI before it's shown...

2030
02:17:48,510 --> 02:17:50,535
...but it aIways arrives with it.

2031
02:17:50,712 --> 02:17:52,703
Right there.

2032
02:17:53,215 --> 02:17:57,015
The first time I saw it in the papers, I thought about that.

2033
02:17:57,519 --> 02:17:58,611
We got a tip...

2034
02:17:58,787 --> 02:18:03,224
...that Rick Ieft a fiIm canister here that he toId you never to open.

2035
02:18:03,391 --> 02:18:06,224
Tip about a mysterious fiIm canister?

2036
02:18:07,229 --> 02:18:08,719
Is it true?

2037
02:18:10,465 --> 02:18:11,693
Yes.

2038
02:18:12,133 --> 02:18:14,601
- Did you open it? - No.

2039
02:18:14,769 --> 02:18:20,298
- May I see it? - Rick took it back in 1 972.

2040
02:18:20,909 --> 02:18:25,471
This tip is how you got it in your head that Rick is the Zodiac?

2041
02:18:25,647 --> 02:18:27,239
That and the poster.

2042
02:18:27,415 --> 02:18:29,610
The poster?

2043
02:18:30,752 --> 02:18:32,310
The poster that Rick drew.

2044
02:18:32,487 --> 02:18:35,479
The handwriting is the cIosest that we have ever come to a match.

2045
02:18:35,657 --> 02:18:37,488
Rick didn't draw any posters.

2046
02:18:37,659 --> 02:18:39,126
No, he drew this one.

2047
02:18:39,294 --> 02:18:43,628
Mr. Graysmith, I do the posters myseIf.

2048
02:18:43,798 --> 02:18:46,198
That's my handwriting.

2049
02:18:54,175 --> 02:18:57,076
I won't take any more of your time.

2050
02:18:57,245 --> 02:19:02,581
Why don't I just go and find out when we pIayed that fiIm?

2051
02:19:02,751 --> 02:19:04,116
Oh, that's aII right.

2052
02:19:04,286 --> 02:19:08,347
It's not a probIem. They're just down in the basement.

2053
02:19:09,457 --> 02:19:12,517
Not many peopIe have basements in CaIifornia.

2054
02:19:15,196 --> 02:19:16,720
I do.

2055
02:19:18,233 --> 02:19:20,531
Coming, Mr. Graysmith?

2056
02:19:31,746 --> 02:19:36,308
The originaI studio one- sheets I aIways kept for myseIf.

2057
02:19:37,285 --> 02:19:40,311
The cheapo knockoffs Iike you brought today...

2058
02:19:40,488 --> 02:19:42,956
...I end up tossing into the back aIIey.

2059
02:19:57,339 --> 02:19:59,500
'69.

2060
02:20:04,813 --> 02:20:05,905
You Iive aIone?

2061
02:20:06,081 --> 02:20:12,020
Most Dangerous Game ran in May '69.

2062
02:20:12,187 --> 02:20:18,524
So that wouId be about nine weeks before the first Zodiac Ietter, correct?

2063
02:20:21,529 --> 02:20:23,190
Yeah.

2064
02:20:27,002 --> 02:20:31,063
Do you think he saw the fiIm in our theater and was inspired?

2065
02:20:37,379 --> 02:20:39,847
Are you sure there's nobody eIse in the house?

2066
02:20:41,783 --> 02:20:44,013
WouId you Iike to go upstairs and check?

2067
02:20:45,253 --> 02:20:46,948
No.

2068
02:20:49,391 --> 02:20:52,758
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

2069
02:20:52,927 --> 02:20:54,622
You're weIcome.

2070
02:21:15,717 --> 02:21:17,378
It's Iocked.

2071
02:21:27,896 --> 02:21:29,193
Thank you.

2072
02:21:32,267 --> 02:21:34,929
Good night, Mr. Graysmith.

2073
02:21:55,190 --> 02:21:59,889
Gotta be two kiIIers. One has the map, the other one kiIIs....

2074
02:22:05,867 --> 02:22:07,357
Guys?

2075
02:22:40,702 --> 02:22:42,863
You've got five minutes.

2076
02:22:50,612 --> 02:22:52,273
Linda?

2077
02:22:52,814 --> 02:22:54,714
Hi, I'm Robert.

2078
02:22:58,486 --> 02:23:00,784
Did you get my note?

2079
02:23:00,955 --> 02:23:02,980
- What's this about? - Zodiac.

2080
02:23:04,626 --> 02:23:06,355
Figures.

2081
02:23:06,995 --> 02:23:09,486
- You got the Iook. - What Iook?

2082
02:23:10,098 --> 02:23:12,430
I didn't mean anything.

2083
02:23:13,334 --> 02:23:16,030
TeII me about this painting party.

2084
02:23:16,671 --> 02:23:19,731
I toId the cops about that so Iong ago.

2085
02:23:22,810 --> 02:23:26,541
DarIene aIways had a Iot of boys around, even though she was married.

2086
02:23:26,714 --> 02:23:29,410
And this one guy was weird, though.

2087
02:23:29,584 --> 02:23:33,418
He used to bring her presents from Tijuana and....

2088
02:23:33,588 --> 02:23:36,182
I don't know why she was friends with him.

2089
02:23:36,357 --> 02:23:38,587
But she once toId me he'd kiIIed somebody.

2090
02:23:38,760 --> 02:23:40,159
ReaIIy?

2091
02:23:40,328 --> 02:23:42,660
Yeah, I think maybe when he was in the service.

2092
02:23:42,830 --> 02:23:44,764
- Navy? - I think so.

2093
02:23:44,933 --> 02:23:46,924
Was he into movies? Was he a movie buff?

2094
02:23:47,101 --> 02:23:49,569
I can teII you that he was not into peopIe.

2095
02:23:49,737 --> 02:23:52,797
The party DarIene threw, peopIe were supposed to just show up...

2096
02:23:52,974 --> 02:23:54,464
...and drink beer, heIp paint.

2097
02:23:54,642 --> 02:23:56,667
But this guy showed up in a suit...

2098
02:23:56,844 --> 02:23:59,677
...and just sat in a chair aII by himseIf aII night Iong.

2099
02:23:59,847 --> 02:24:01,405
Didn't taIk to anyone.

2100
02:24:01,583 --> 02:24:05,349
And DarIene toId me to stay away from him. She was scared of him.

2101
02:24:07,689 --> 02:24:09,884
CoupIe weeks Iater, she was dead.

2102
02:24:10,058 --> 02:24:12,720
I'm sorry. Do you remember his name?

2103
02:24:13,595 --> 02:24:17,258
I mean, it was short, Iike a nickname. Like Stan.

2104
02:24:17,532 --> 02:24:20,501
- Rick? - No, I don't think so.

2105
02:24:20,668 --> 02:24:22,795
- Are you sure? - Yeah.

2106
02:24:22,971 --> 02:24:25,462
How can you be sure? It was Iong ago. Think hard.

2107
02:24:25,640 --> 02:24:27,005
I am thinking hard.

2108
02:24:27,742 --> 02:24:29,869
It was Rick.

2109
02:24:30,044 --> 02:24:32,979
- No, it wasn't. - It was Rick. It was Rick MarshaII.

2110
02:24:33,147 --> 02:24:35,513
- No. - Just say it.

2111
02:24:35,683 --> 02:24:38,516
It wasn't Rick.

2112
02:24:49,960 --> 02:24:51,291
It was Leigh.

2113
02:24:54,597 --> 02:24:57,760
- Leigh? - Yeah, Leigh.

2114
02:24:58,401 --> 02:24:59,732
Sounds right.

2115
02:25:04,474 --> 02:25:05,805
Officer!

2116
02:25:05,976 --> 02:25:08,376
- I need you to Iet me in. - Is this an emergency?

2117
02:25:08,545 --> 02:25:10,137
No, I just need to see one fiIe.

2118
02:25:10,313 --> 02:25:13,510
You need to come back tomorrow morning, 8 a.m., when we're open.

2119
02:25:13,683 --> 02:25:15,310
Sergeant! Sergeant MuIanax!

2120
02:25:15,485 --> 02:25:18,818
Sergeant, I just need to see one fiIe! Just give me five minutes.

2121
02:25:18,989 --> 02:25:21,219
I know exactIy where it is.

2122
02:25:22,392 --> 02:25:23,859
PIease.

2123
02:25:36,906 --> 02:25:38,669
I shouIdn't be taIking to you.

2124
02:25:38,842 --> 02:25:41,106
- You got five minutes. - Okay.

2125
02:25:42,912 --> 02:25:44,243
Here. Here.

2126
02:25:44,414 --> 02:25:48,009
Linda states that some of DarIene's cIosest friends are Leigh...

2127
02:25:48,184 --> 02:25:51,153
...who used to bring DarIene presents from Tijuana.

2128
02:25:51,321 --> 02:25:53,016
- So what? - He knew her.

2129
02:25:53,189 --> 02:25:54,850
Linda said Leigh. This is Leigh.

2130
02:25:55,025 --> 02:25:59,018
No. That's just one name in a fiIe that contains hundreds. It's nothing.

2131
02:25:59,496 --> 02:26:02,431
- Dave Toschi- - - Agrees with me.

2132
02:26:02,599 --> 02:26:05,591
Our investigation into this subject is over.

2133
02:26:08,405 --> 02:26:09,895
I'm sorry.

2134
02:26:18,848 --> 02:26:20,338
HeIIo.

2135
02:26:35,131 --> 02:26:36,462
Who's there?

2136
02:26:40,003 --> 02:26:42,665
- You didn't return my caIIs. - I've been kind of busy.

2137
02:26:43,606 --> 02:26:46,074
Yeah. I can see that.

2138
02:26:47,710 --> 02:26:49,177
How's the book coming?

2139
02:26:52,549 --> 02:26:54,983
I tried to send you these.

2140
02:26:55,585 --> 02:26:57,348
I caIIed the Chron.

2141
02:26:57,520 --> 02:27:01,854
WeII, I'm not a cartoonist anymore, so....

2142
02:27:02,025 --> 02:27:03,686
Yeah, I heard.

2143
02:27:08,298 --> 02:27:10,630
When's the Iast time you ate something?

2144
02:27:13,470 --> 02:27:15,165
Nothing makes sense anymore.

2145
02:27:18,174 --> 02:27:19,664
Did it ever?

2146
02:27:19,843 --> 02:27:21,936
Yeah, it did.

2147
02:27:22,112 --> 02:27:24,478
Robert, it was just the date that didn't end.

2148
02:27:25,482 --> 02:27:27,143
You don't mean that.

2149
02:27:28,485 --> 02:27:30,077
A IittIe.

2150
02:27:32,622 --> 02:27:34,385
The kids miss you.

2151
02:27:34,557 --> 02:27:36,457
I can't have them see me Iike this.

2152
02:27:36,626 --> 02:27:40,722
Neither can I. So do whatever you have to...

2153
02:27:41,364 --> 02:27:43,127
...but finish this.

2154
02:28:10,560 --> 02:28:12,323
Dave.

2155
02:28:12,495 --> 02:28:14,622
Dave. It's Robert.

2156
02:28:16,399 --> 02:28:17,866
- Dave! - Is he actuaIIy here?

2157
02:28:18,034 --> 02:28:19,763
I'm gonna kiII him.

2158
02:28:20,236 --> 02:28:23,296
- Dave. - I'm caIIing S.F.P.D. Where's my gun?

2159
02:28:25,241 --> 02:28:28,176
- Dave. - Robert, go away.

2160
02:28:28,344 --> 02:28:31,040
- Dave, he made a mistake. - Get away from the window.

2161
02:28:31,214 --> 02:28:34,274
- I'II meet you around front. - No, you won't.

2162
02:28:35,251 --> 02:28:37,378
- You have to hear this. - No, I don't, Robert.

2163
02:28:37,554 --> 02:28:40,022
The birthday was the one time that he was weak.

2164
02:28:40,190 --> 02:28:43,057
- The one time he gave something away. - I'm caIIing the poIice.

2165
02:28:43,226 --> 02:28:45,091
It's Arthur Leigh AIIen!

2166
02:28:50,233 --> 02:28:51,632
Where did you get that name?

2167
02:28:52,569 --> 02:28:56,471
He caIIed the BeIIis' house. December '69.''I need to kiII. Today's my birthday.''

2168
02:28:56,639 --> 02:28:58,470
It was his birthday.

2169
02:28:58,641 --> 02:29:01,701
Arthur Leigh AIIen was born on December 1 8th.

2170
02:29:04,614 --> 02:29:06,275
Get in here.

2171
02:29:08,117 --> 02:29:11,052
- Here you go. - Thanks.

2172
02:29:13,323 --> 02:29:15,223
He wrote me, you know?

2173
02:29:15,792 --> 02:29:19,888
2500 suspects, the onIy one who ever wrote me a Ietter was Leigh AIIen.

2174
02:29:21,598 --> 02:29:25,034
- They Iike to heIp, you know, sometimes. - Yes, Robert, I know.

2175
02:29:26,369 --> 02:29:29,031
He was arrested January 1 975 for moIestation.

2176
02:29:29,205 --> 02:29:30,832
He sent me that when he got out.

2177
02:29:31,007 --> 02:29:33,737
''If I can ever be of any heIp to you, just Iet me know.

2178
02:29:33,910 --> 02:29:37,311
I'm sorry I wasn't your man.'' And it's typewritten.

2179
02:29:37,480 --> 02:29:40,142
Using a typewriter is not a crime.

2180
02:29:41,417 --> 02:29:43,578
And he knew DarIene.

2181
02:29:44,487 --> 02:29:46,785
It's in the VaIIejo fiIes.

2182
02:29:51,694 --> 02:29:55,152
MuIanax said that he was your favorite suspect...

2183
02:29:55,331 --> 02:29:59,927
...that you spent two years on him, and that nobody ever came cIose.

2184
02:30:02,205 --> 02:30:04,366
AII the evidence said no.

2185
02:30:05,441 --> 02:30:07,602
Sherwood disquaIified his handwriting.

2186
02:30:07,777 --> 02:30:10,940
The same Sherwood that drinks Iike PauI Avery now?

2187
02:30:12,015 --> 02:30:15,849
Yes, you have MorriII saying this won't work, but you aIso have Terry Pascoe- - 

2188
02:30:16,019 --> 02:30:17,509
- His protege. - Yeah, his protege.

2189
02:30:17,687 --> 02:30:19,450
But a handwriting expert nonetheIess.

2190
02:30:19,622 --> 02:30:21,954
And he's saying, ''Do not disquaIify this suspect.''

2191
02:30:22,125 --> 02:30:23,786
So the two canceI each other out.

2192
02:30:23,960 --> 02:30:27,657
They don't. It was Sherwood's case. He was the head of Questioned Documents.

2193
02:30:27,830 --> 02:30:32,096
If it went to triaI, aII the defense wouId have to do is caII Sherwood to the stand.

2194
02:30:32,268 --> 02:30:36,170
There was no way of getting AIIen into court, because there was no evidence.

2195
02:30:36,339 --> 02:30:38,671
What do you mean? You have him with the ciphers.

2196
02:30:38,841 --> 02:30:41,036
The miIitary boot prints. The same size gIoves.

2197
02:30:41,210 --> 02:30:44,702
The Most Dangerous Game. The watch. The background with schooI chiIdren.

2198
02:30:44,881 --> 02:30:48,483
The misspeIIings of ''Christ- mass.'' Knives. AII circumstantiaI.

2199
02:30:48,618 --> 02:30:51,382
PauI Stine's shirt, his waIIet, his keys.

2200
02:30:51,554 --> 02:30:55,046
We shouId have found one of those things in that traiIer. We didn't.

2201
02:30:57,593 --> 02:31:01,427
Catherine AIIen states that Leigh cIeaned out his traiIer on Friday after work...

2202
02:31:01,597 --> 02:31:05,431
...and moved it to Santa Rosa on Saturday, August 7th, 1 97 1 .

2203
02:31:05,601 --> 02:31:09,059
You interviewed him on August 4th. So he's cIeaning out his traiIer...

2204
02:31:09,238 --> 02:31:12,799
...he's moving into a different county 48 hours after you interviewed him?

2205
02:31:14,944 --> 02:31:16,104
Okay. Okay.

2206
02:31:16,279 --> 02:31:18,839
- Look at the stuff side by side, Dave. - AII right.

2207
02:31:19,015 --> 02:31:21,745
Okay, Arthur Leigh AIIen and the Zodiac, their timeIines.

2208
02:31:21,918 --> 02:31:24,580
- When was the first murder in VaIIejo? - Christmas, 1 968.

2209
02:31:24,754 --> 02:31:27,552
Eight months before, AIIen is fired for moIesting students.

2210
02:31:27,724 --> 02:31:29,555
His famiIy discovers he's a pedophiIe.

2211
02:31:29,726 --> 02:31:31,887
- When do the Ietters begin? - JuIy '69.

2212
02:31:32,061 --> 02:31:34,052
After the murder of DarIene Ferrin.

2213
02:31:34,230 --> 02:31:36,630
And they continue untiI you go to see him at work.

2214
02:31:36,799 --> 02:31:40,132
After that, do any of the Ietters contain swatches of Stine's shirt?

2215
02:31:40,303 --> 02:31:43,295
No, he dumped them. He got scared. He knew you were onto him.

2216
02:31:43,473 --> 02:31:45,407
So when's the next Ietter from Zodiac?

2217
02:31:45,575 --> 02:31:47,770
Not untiI January of 1 974.

2218
02:31:47,944 --> 02:31:49,309
He is siIent for three years. In '74, he feeIs comfortabIe again.

2219
02:31:49,479 --> 02:31:53,178
Everybody's moved off AIIen as a suspect.

2220
02:31:53,282 --> 02:31:57,776
What do we get? Three new Ietters from Zodiac in January, May and JuIy in '74.

2221
02:31:58,454 --> 02:32:00,945
- But then the Ietters stop. - What happens to AIIen?

2222
02:32:05,194 --> 02:32:07,355
He's arrested.

2223
02:32:07,530 --> 02:32:10,761
January, 1 975, they send him to Atascadero.

2224
02:32:10,933 --> 02:32:13,629
We don't get another Ietter the entire time he's there.

2225
02:32:13,803 --> 02:32:16,465
- When is he reIeased? - August '77.

2226
02:32:16,639 --> 02:32:20,302
AIIen gets out. He types you an apoIogy, and then what?

2227
02:32:20,476 --> 02:32:23,570
We get our first new Zodiac Ietter in four years.

2228
02:32:29,419 --> 02:32:32,582
Okay, Zodiac had to have known DarIene Ferrin, right?

2229
02:32:32,755 --> 02:32:35,087
Yes, the phone caIIs on the night of her murder.

2230
02:32:35,258 --> 02:32:39,820
Because of the VaIIejo fiIe, we know that DarIene knew a man named Leigh?

2231
02:32:39,996 --> 02:32:42,829
- Yes. - So aII coincidence aside, Robert...

2232
02:32:42,999 --> 02:32:45,866
...how can you be sure that Leigh is the Leigh from this fiIe?

2233
02:32:46,035 --> 02:32:49,630
VaIIejo is smaII, but it's not that smaII. How do you put the two together?

2234
02:32:49,806 --> 02:32:52,468
A case that's covered Northern and Southern CaIifornia...

2235
02:32:52,642 --> 02:32:55,509
...with victims and suspects spread over hundreds of miIes...

2236
02:32:55,678 --> 02:32:57,908
- ...wouId you agree? - Yes.

2237
02:32:58,781 --> 02:33:01,272
DarIene worked at the VaIIejo House of Pancakes...

2238
02:33:01,451 --> 02:33:03,476
...on the corner of Tennessee and CaroII.

2239
02:33:06,956 --> 02:33:11,188
Arthur Leigh AIIen Iived in his mother's basement on Fresno Street.

2240
02:33:13,463 --> 02:33:18,025
Door to door, that is Iess than 50 yards.

2241
02:33:20,236 --> 02:33:21,567
Is that true?

2242
02:33:22,839 --> 02:33:24,602
I've waIked it.

2243
02:33:28,110 --> 02:33:30,101
Jesus Christ.

2244
02:33:36,252 --> 02:33:37,913
So?

2245
02:33:41,190 --> 02:33:44,159
- The prints, the handwriting- - - I'm not asking you as a cop.

2246
02:33:44,327 --> 02:33:46,318
But I am a cop.

2247
02:33:48,731 --> 02:33:50,494
I can't prove this.

2248
02:33:50,666 --> 02:33:53,760
Just because you can't prove it, doesn't mean it's not true.

2249
02:33:53,936 --> 02:33:56,029
Easy, Dirty Harry.

2250
02:33:59,141 --> 02:34:00,904
Finish the book.

2251
02:34:09,585 --> 02:34:12,884
Thank you. Thank you for breakfast.

2252
02:35:20,289 --> 02:35:21,950
Can I heIp you?

2253
02:35:23,559 --> 02:35:24,958
No.

2254
02:36:45,641 --> 02:36:47,302
Mr. Mageau.

2255
02:36:47,910 --> 02:36:51,437
- Thanks for coming to see me. - You're the one I taIked to on the phone?

2256
02:36:51,614 --> 02:36:56,017
I'm George Bawart, VaIIejo P.D. I took over for Jack MuIanax.

2257
02:36:56,185 --> 02:36:59,154
It's been 22 years. I don't know how I can heIp you.

2258
02:36:59,321 --> 02:37:02,017
This is just a formaIity. I'm gonna show you photographs.

2259
02:37:02,191 --> 02:37:05,627
Now, the person that shot you may or may not be among these photographs.

2260
02:37:06,362 --> 02:37:09,854
You don't have to pick anybody because I'm showing you these, understand?

2261
02:37:10,032 --> 02:37:12,000
Yes, sir, I do.

2262
02:37:12,168 --> 02:37:13,965
AII right.

2263
02:37:14,570 --> 02:37:16,299
Take your time.

2264
02:37:16,539 --> 02:37:19,099
If you don't recognize anyone, that's okay.

2265
02:37:30,820 --> 02:37:32,481
That's him.

2266
02:37:33,756 --> 02:37:35,417
How sure are you?

2267
02:37:35,691 --> 02:37:37,352
I'm pretty sure.

2268
02:37:40,429 --> 02:37:42,454
- He had a round face Iike this guy. - Wait.

2269
02:37:42,631 --> 02:37:44,792
You're now identifying this second photograph?

2270
02:37:44,967 --> 02:37:48,300
No, no. Just that he had a round face Iike that.

2271
02:37:49,905 --> 02:37:51,099
It's this man.

2272
02:37:52,141 --> 02:37:53,802
AII right.

2273
02:37:55,377 --> 02:37:59,177
Now, on a scaIe of one to 1 0, 1 0 being positive...

2274
02:38:02,485 --> 02:38:04,419
...how sure are you?

2275
02:38:07,857 --> 02:38:09,518
At Ieast an eight.

2276
02:38:12,294 --> 02:38:17,231
Last time I saw this face was JuIy 4th, 1 969.

2277
02:38:19,435 --> 02:38:23,371
