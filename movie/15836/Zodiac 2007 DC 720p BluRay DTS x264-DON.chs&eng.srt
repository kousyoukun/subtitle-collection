I want you to print this cipher on the front page of your paper.

If the Examiner doesn't have the balls to run it,

116
00:11:48,512 --> 00:11:50,100
 我们就拿到湾区的独家报导

刊登了  就会创下危险的先例
If we run it, we might be setting a very dangerous precedent.

120

拜托  这很有新闻爆点
Oh, come on, now, it's newsworthy.

121
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:01,550
那大众又将怎么看待我们报社
Well, giving some sick bastard a soapbox, what does that say to people?

I will not give you my name because you will try to slow down

197
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,680
你们会阻碍我死后收藏奴隶

描述杀人详细过程
Details about the murders.

215
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,140
他在枪上装上手电筒  所以才能在黑暗中行凶
He taped a flashlight to the gun. That's how he hit them in the dark.

216

You know this used to be the town of Montecello?

220
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:07,310
后来郡政府认为这块土地  改成一座湖比较有用
But at some point, the county decided that the land would work better as a lake.

221
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,310
所以就把它淹没了
So they flooded it.

222
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,320
-一整座城镇  -就这样沉在水底

-躲在树后面  -好  他只是在撇尿
-He went behind that tree. -All right. So he's taking a leak.

229
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,100
他走过来了
He's coming towards us.

230
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,530
老天  他手上有枪
Oh, my God, he has a gun.

231

236
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,780
你可以拿走我所有的东西
You're welcome to everything I have.

237
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,890
还是我可以给你其它的东西
If there's anything else I could do for you

238
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,090
好比说开张支票给你

239
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,900
我可以给你我的电话号码

-Even more than you might think. -He's a sociology major.

Oh, keys. You know, I'm sorry, I don't know exactly where I put my keys.

躺下来让我绑住你的脚

那帕市警察局
Napa Police Department.

271
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:59,230
我要举报一起命案
I want to report a murder. No, a double murder.

272
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,240
是双尸命案
They are two miles north of park headquarters.

273
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:07,510
陈尸在公园内的白色福斯汽车内
They were in a white Volkswagen Karmann-Ghia.

274
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,420
人是我杀的
I'm the one that did it.

Boy lived, the girl didn't. Again.

277
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:22,190
老天  很难想像有幸存者
God, can you imagine surviving something like that? Writing the dates on the side of the car.

278
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,800
瓦列霍两起凶杀案  那帕一起  为什么在那帕?
We got two Vallejo killings, now there's one in Napa. Why Napa?

279
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:29,130
他为什么在瓦列霍以外的地方做案?  我的老天K
What the hell is he doing out of Vallejo? Sweet mother of Christ

280
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,140
你在划什么?
What are you drawing?

281
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:34,400
湖边的大学生  这是他描述黄道带的打扮
Kid at the lake. This is what he said the Zodiac was wearing.

282
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,170
-天哪  果然是怪里怪气的  -保罗  你在做什么?
God, that's a hell of a get-up. -Paul, what are you doing?

海曼  我写完了  我现在要把它打出来
Hyman, I wrote it. It's done. Now I just got to type it up.

284
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,540
没打完不算  我们还要审稿
Type it up? It's not finished until you type it up. We've got to read it.

285
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,220
-那是什么?  -湖边的黄道带
-What's that? -That's the Zodiac at the lake.

286
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:53,380
那小子是什么来头?  他怪怪的  好像嗑了药...
What's the story with the kid? He seems a little touched or medicated or...

287
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,830
小葛吗?  他是乖乖牌
Graysmith? Yeah, what is it? He's a fucking boy scout.

288
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,660
不抽烟  不喝酒  不讲脏话
He doesn't smoke, he doesn't drink, he doesn't curse.

289
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,670
他回来了  人类比任何猛兽更危险
And he's back. I knew it. Man is the most dangerous animal of all.

290
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,100
我听过这句话在<最危险的游戏>里

00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,770
猎杀人类  最危险的游戏
People. The Most Dangerous Game.

293
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:14,640
-那是谁?  -瑟若夫公爵
-Who's that? -That's Count Zaroff.

294
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,810
瑟若夫?  字头是Z?
Zaroff? With a Z?

295
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,080
这是新闻快报
And that will be all for the news on the 20.

296
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,750
以下的地区将进行宵禁

旧金山的维克叩应  你不怕黄道带?
Vic in San Francisco, you're on the line. You're not scared of the Zodiac?

301
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,530
谁会怕他  他只杀乡下小孩
Heck no, he's only shooting those farm kids.

302
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,230
我怕的是穿着奇装异服
What scares me is those hippies out in the Haight

303
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,400
只会乱搞杂交的嬉皮
with their free love and weird clothes.

304
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,480
来自华卡维尔市的艾菲瑞叩应
We've got Alfred from Vacaville.

305
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:47,510
刚才那位先生在做人身攻击  死者不只是乡下小孩
You know, I think that was really offensive. It's not just farm kids.

306
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,280
他们是品行优良的年轻人
These are nice, clean-cut young people.

307
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:52,010
没人贬低这些人的性命
Hey, nobody's downplaying the loss of human life here, Alfred.

308
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,090
上一个家伙就这么想
Well, that last guy was.

309
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,120
我们北湾是个优良的社区
We have good solid communities out here in the North Bay.

310
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:00,850
不像那些充斥撒旦崇拜者的城市
Unlike in the city where you have Satanists running around.

311
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:04,060
说得好  黄道带崇拜撒旦吗?
Well, you bring up a good question. Is the Zodiac a Satanist?

312
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,200
奥克兰的安柏  你认为呢?
Amber from Oakland, what do you think?

313
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:10,100
不晓得  不过印在报上的密码  不像是基督教符号
I don't really know, but I thought that code they printed didn't look very Christian.

314
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,300
我认为报社不该刊登K
But I think the bigger problem is that the papers shouldn't have printed

315
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,200
任何关于黄道带做的事
anything that the Zodiac has been doing.

316
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,370
他们只是为了增加发行量
That they're just printing all that stuff to sell more newspapers.

317
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:22,450
不过黄道带也说不刊登的话  他就会杀更多人
Well, the Zodiac did demand they print his letters or he'd kill more people.

318
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,680
登不登他照样会杀人  至少我个人认为是这样
Yeah, but he would have done it anyway, whether they printed it or not, I think.

319
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:29,190
很有趣的观点  你认为接下来他会怎么做?
An interesting point. So, what do you think he'll do next?

320
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:53,140
-旧金山警局  -有人在计程车里打架
-San Francisco Police Department. -Yes. There's a fight in a cab!

321
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,580

华盛顿街3398号  樱桃街转角
3398 Washington, at the corner of Cherry.

323
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,880
有人喝醉了  他好像在抢劫
One's drunk and we think he's robbing him.

324
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,510
-歹徒还在犯案吗?  -是的  拜托你们快点
-Is the crime still in progress? -Yes, please hurry.

325
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,520
天哪  你看!
Oh, my God, look!

326
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,750
可恶!
Nuts!

327
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,380
不管你是谁  你欠我一座新台灯
Whoever this is, you owe me a new lamp.

328

计程车司机在普西迪区遭枪杀
Cabbie's been shot three blocks from the Presidio.

329
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:41,230
凶手又不是我  我老婆可以担保我整晚都陪着她
Well, it wasn't me. I've been with my bride all night. She can vouch.

330
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,460
去煮咖啡
Go put on the Folgers.

331
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,030
你会来接我?
You'll pick me up?

332
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,730
我先说你要赔我哪种台灯
Let me just describe the lamp you're gonna buy me.

333
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,840
-我才刚上床耶  -嫌犯是个黑人男性

说真的  我已经睡到手都麻了
Seriously, dead asleep. I lost feeling in my arm and everything.

336
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,080
要吃饼干吗?
Crackers.

337
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,430
你吃过日本料理吗?
You ever try Japanese food?

338
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:14,260
-什么意思  像是照烧吗?  -不  像是生海胆?
-What do you mean, like teriyaki? -No, like the urchin.

339
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,960
-生鱼片?  -我正在吃东西耶
-Raw fish. -I'm eating here, Bill.

340
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,170
-我一直想试试看  -那你为什么不试?
-I always wanted to try it. -So, why don't you?

341
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,860
没时间
Haven't got around to it.

342
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,980
晚安两位  今晚真是笨贼一箩筐
Evening, gents. What a lovely night for a botched robbery.

343
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,650
这礼拜第三起  一定是趁收假前捞一笔
Yeah, third this week. Must be end of summer rush.

344
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,990
我派人带了警犬巡逻公园
I got foot patrols going through the park, dogs are on the way.

345
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,260
被害人是保罗史坦  死亡时间是十点十分
The victim's name is Paul Stine. Dousette pronounced him at 10:10.

嫌犯朝后脑勺开了一枪 
Suspect fired one shot

348
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,600
你怎么知道被害人的名字?

353
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,470
小孩从那扇窗看见嫌犯
Kids who called it in saw the suspect from that window.

354
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,450
-他们有听见枪声吗?  -没有
-Did they hear a shot? -No.

355
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,450
他们以为嫌犯喝醉  跑到前座去殴打驾驶
They first saw him in the front seat, thought he was a drunk fighting with the driver.

356
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,460
大的那个孩子跑到楼下看清楚
Oldest kid ran downstairs to get a better look from the dining room,

357
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,725
她形容嫌犯为男性白人  戴眼镜

358
00:28:19,726 --> 00:28:21,820

crewcut, stocky, and wearing a dark jacket.

359
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,014
等等  不是说嫌犯是黑人吗?
Wait, I thought someone said he was black.

360
00:28:24,015 --> 00:28:25,760
  那是无线电传送的报告
 That's the description that went out to radio cars.

361
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:28,630
-我们已经更正了  -那好
-We already corrected it. -Oh, well, that's good.

-Prints?  -Could very well be. We'll dust it at the Hall.

369
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,750
奇怪的是  还找到手套
The odd thing is, we also got gloves.

370
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:54,020
-嫌犯的吗?  -手套上有血迹
-Suspect's?  -There's blood on them.

371
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,430

Hey, Pete?

372
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,590
我能进去吗?
You through over there, can I get in there?

373
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,470
-谁动了他?  -史都华
-Who rolled him?  -Stewarts.

374
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,810
我找到一枚九米厘弹壳
I got a single 9mm casing.

375
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,410
是啊  鲁格手枪
Yeah, Luger.

376
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,710
围观者没有任何线索
Nothing from the crowd.

377
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,290
假设我是黑人男性嫌犯K
Okay. I'm your shooter, Negro male adult,

378
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,320
其实是健壮结实的平头白人
who also happens to be a stocky, crew-cut Caucasian.

379
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,960
我叫了车子  给他这个住址
I flag a cab. I give him this address.

380
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,060
我有给他住址吗?  车资记录呢?
Did I give him this address? Who's got the fare book?

381
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,460
在这里
Right here.

382
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,940
华盛顿和枫树街口  东边的那条街口
Washington and Maple. That's one block east.

383
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,460
光线和这边差不多  假设我看见有人正在遛狗
Lighting's the same over here, so maybe I see someone walking their dog.

384
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:06,730
你不希望有任何目击者  所以叫他多开一条街再停车
You don't want any witnesses so you tell him to go down a block. He pulls over.

385
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,890
我很聪明  等他排到停车挡
I wait for him to put it in park because I'm smart

386
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:11,560
以免下手的时候他踩油门
and I don't want him hitting the accelerator when I shoot him. May I?

387
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,940
停车  排档  砰!
He stops, puts it in park, boom.

388
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,440
我从右边开枪  他倒向右边?
I shoot him on the right side, he slumps right?

389
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:19,170
也许你边开枪边抓他的衣领
Maybe you've got your hand on his collar when you shoot.

390
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,040
不管怎样  我在前座  留下了大量血迹
All right. So, either way, I just dumped a quart of blood in the front seat.

391
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,120
-你为什么要到前座?  -为了拿钱
-So, why do you get in the front seat? -For the money.

392
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,280
他挂了  你只要伸手拿钱包就行
But he's dead. You could just reach over the seat, pull out his wallet.

393
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,950
这样根本不用担心沾到血迹
You don't have to go anywhere near the blood.

394
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,960
你为什么要走到前座?
So, why'd he get in the front seat?

395
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,200
-因为我是个笨蛋  -但你不是笨蛋
-I'm an idiot. -But you're not an idiot.

396
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,130
你等他排档了
You waited for him to put it in park.

397
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,560
-谢了  -不客气
-Right. Thank you. -Yeah, sure.

398
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,360
-我能看看吗?  -可以
-Can I see that? -Yeah.

399
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,670
我真笨  为了8块2毛钱杀人
I am an idiot. I just killed a man for $8.25.

400
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:51,210
他是今晚第三名乘客  谁有卡通动物饼干?
It's his third fare of the night. Does anyone have any animal crackers?

401
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,110
-卡通动物饼干?  -在车上
-Animal crackers? -They're in the car.

402
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,220
我留着等会儿吃
I'm saving those for later.

403
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,050
好吧
Fine.

404
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,590
-你是记者吗?  -不是  我是旧金山警局的陶希警探
-Are you a reporter? -No, I'm Inspector Dave Toschi, SFPD.

405
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,490
我能不能分别向您的小孩问话
Sir, I was wondering if I'd be able to talk to your children,

406
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:12,400
-最好是单独问话?  -他们才刚看到一个人被杀
-One at a time and preferably alone? -They just saw a man murdered.

407
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,400
我了解
I understand.

408
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:17,470
他们看起来像喝醉在打架  对啊  他拿了一块破布
It looked like they were drunk and fighting. Yeah, and he had a rag.

409
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,940
走到车子旁边擦什么东西
He came around the side of the car and he was wiping stuff.

410
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,940
你有看到他的脸吗?
Did you get a chance to see his face?

411
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:25,380
我有  算是有吧
I did. Well, sort of.

412
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,880
你记得他长什么样吗?
Did you remember what he looked like?

413
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,820
很普通
Normal.

414
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,050
-是啊  -很普通?
-Yeah. -Normal?

415
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:41,690
(<旧金山纪事报>  请速交编辑部)

416
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,460
(速交编辑部)

417
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,040
(三天后-加州旧金山)

418
00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:00,380
我是黄道带  昨晚在华盛顿街
This is the Zodiac speaking. I am the murderer of the taxi driver

419
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,950
枫树街口杀害计程车司机的凶手
over by Washington Street and Maple Street last night.

420
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,950
附上被害人一块血衣做为证据
To prove this, here is a blood-stained piece of his shirt.

421
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,720
我也是北湾区命案的凶手
I am the same man who did in the people in the North Bay Area.

422
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:16,260
旧金山警方昨晚本来能抓到我
The S.F. Police could have caught him last night

423
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,777
如果他们仔细搜查公园 
if they had searched the park properly

424
00:32:17,778 --> 00:32:19,370
 而不是骑着摩托车到处乱飙
 instead of holding road races with their motorcicles.

425
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:20,970
-各位  -大卫
-Gentlemen. -Dave.

426
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,430
保罗  衬衫在哪里?
Paul. Where's the shirt?

427
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,100
在这里  老大
Right there, boss.

428
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,105
这就是小孩说的那块破布 
There's your rag the kids talked about. 

429
00:32:29,106 --> 00:32:30,900
 他走到前座撕下衬衫一角
So he got in the front seat to tear off a piece of the shirt.

430
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,380
-这算正式记录吗?  -你认为呢?
-Is this on the record? -Well, what do you think?

431
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,710
他证实了瓦列霍及那帕的命案
He confirms the Vallejo and Napa killings.

432
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,440
-情况还会更糟  -罗伯  你不用截稿吗?
-Gets worse. -Robert, do you have a deadline?

433
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,310
情况还会更糟是啥意思?
What does he mean, it gets worse?

434
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,020
念念最后的部分
Read the last part.

435
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,460
小学生是很好的目标
School children make nice targets.

436
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,750
我要在早上毁掉一辆校车
I think I shall wipe out a school bus some morning.

437
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,420
先把前轮射穿
Just shoot out the front tire

438
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,230
然后一个一个把他们干掉
and then pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out.

439
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,560
我的天  谁负责管校车?  交通部吗?
Jesus Christ, who's got school buses? Department of Transportation?

440
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,600
-校委会  -好
-School board. -All right.

441
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:59,100
我要采集每位员工的指纹
I'm gonna need elimination prints from your staff.

442
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,870
有谁没碰过这封信?
Has anyone here didn't touch this letter?

443
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,350
我们要比对血迹及布料
We need to get matches on blood and fabric.

444
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,320
我会连络那帕和瓦列霍警局  将信交给沙加缅度警局进行检验
I'll call Napa and Vallejo, get the letters up to Sherwood in Sacramento.

445
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,720
大卫  真的有在车上采到指纹吗?
Dave, just one thing. Is it true they got a print off the cab?

446
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:19,550
没错  沾到血的部分指纹
Yeah, we got a partial in blood.

447
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,620
-这条线索不准刊登  -不会吧  干嘛这样?
-But that is not for publication. -Hey, hey, come on.

448
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,560
连我也不准吗?
Hey, it's me.

449
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,600
他说有采到指纹?
Did he say they got a print?

450
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,300
一部分
Partial.

451
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,540
-他佩枪的方式跟麦昆一样  -是麦昆抄袭陶希警探的
-Dude, he wears his gun like Bullitt. -No, McQueen got that from Toschi.

452
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,728
他觉得黄道带会再寄密码吗? 
Does he think that Zodiac's gonna send another code? 

453
00:33:39,729 --> 00:33:41,170
 我觉得他会再寄密码
'Cause I think Zodiac's gonna send another code.

454
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:44,320
我的老天  你到底在做什么?
Jesus Harold Christ on rubber crutches, Bobby. What are you doing?

455
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:47,650
你又在干我说过的那档  我不喜欢你干的事
You're doing that thing, the thing we discussed, the thing that I don't like.

456
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,310
-在我背后偷瞄  -喔  穿帮了
-Starts with an L. -Oh, looming.

457
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,480
没错
Yeah.

458
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,420
为了和旧金山警方配合
In cooperation with SFPD,

459
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:56,190
我们将刊登黄道带的信件  去掉威胁杀伤学童的那一段
We will run the Zodiac letter without including the threat on school children.

460
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,300
我们不希望造成市民恐慌
We don't want to start a city-wide panic

461
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,490
所以我要请你们保密
so I'm asking all of you to please keep this confidential.

462
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:05,730
回去继续工作吧  谢谢
Just go about your daily business. Thank you.

463
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,130
餐盒中有汽水  红萝卜和花生酱
I packed you your carrots and your soda and peanut butter, okay?

464
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:27,490
-爸  你不用陪我等  -我知道
-Dad, you don't have to wait with me. -I know.

465
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:38,830
等一下  今天我送他上学  好吗?
You know what? You know what? I'm gonna drive him today, okay?

466
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,370
来吧
Come on.

467
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:47,640
(十小时后-加州  沙加缅度  犯罪鉴定与调查局)

468
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,390
那是什么?
What's that?

469
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,860
小写的r有类似之处
Similarities in the lowercase r's.

470
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,900
-那个呢?  -再说一个字...
And that? -It is you waiting in the hall...

471
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,980
就请你到走廊上等  我得集中注意力
if you speak again. I have to concentrate.

472
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:20,670
-抱歉  -抱歉也是字
-Sorry. -Sorry counts as speaking.

473
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,860
小写的r有类似之处
There are similarities in the lowercase r's.

474
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,360
我们得发布校车恐吓的消息
We have to release the bus threat.

475
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:43,960
-一发布我们就完了  -早就完了
-It'll screw us. -We're already screwed.

476
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,230
我们只是把  计程车命案
We just went from Routine Cabbie Shooting

477
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,270
改为校园大屠杀
to Mass Murderer Targets Kids.

478
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:59,180
黄道带来到了旧金山
The Zodiac Killer has come to San Francisco.

479
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:02,350
旧金山警方今晚发布声明

480
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,520
他最后寄去的一封信中K
that in his latest haunting letter,

481
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:07,750
坦承谋杀计程车司机保罗・史坦
which takes credit for the murder of cab driver Paul Stine,

482
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:11,370
黄道带并扬言威胁说  他将锁定校车
the Zodiac has threatened to, Wipe out a school bus

483
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:15,030
把上面的学童一一的杀死
and pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out.

484
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,860
如果您有关于黄道带的线索
If you think you might know who the Zodiac is,

485
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,170
请拨打旧金山警局的报案专线
you can call the San Francisco Police Department's newest tip line.

486
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:32,350
(有潜在同性恋倾向)

487
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:36,820
(十二小时后-加州  旧金山)

488
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:51,200
四点钟开记者会  应该给些消息
Press conference is at 4:00. We got to give them something.

489
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,933
我们和教委会配合 
We're coordinating with the school board, 

490
00:36:52,934 --> 00:36:54,670
 应该很快就会有线索
and we expect a break in the case very soon.

491
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,040
-有什么线索?  -接都接不完的电话
-What do we really got?  -We're swamped.

492
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,010
专线打不进来他们就透过总机
When they can't get anyone on the tip line they call the switchboard and keep getting put through.

493
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:04,020
-有具体的嫌犯吗?  -每小时90名  目前累积到500名
-You got any hard suspects? -About 90 an hour. I'm up to around 500.

494
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:07,250
-不能缩小范围吗?  -我也想  如果我能出去查案...
-Well, can't you narrow it down? -I would love to, if I could get out of this...

495
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,720
重案组  请稍候
Homicide, please hold.

496
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:12,850
对啦  等一下  我们得告诉民众警方动用全力
Yeah, hold, please. We're gonna need to tell them we got the entire force on this.

497
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,550
你能给我多少人力? 
How many men can you give me?

498
00:37:14,551 --> 00:37:16,900
 目前就你和比尔  周一又要上课
 Well, right now, it's you and Bill and Monday's a school day.

499
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,690
我知道  我有三个女儿
Yeah, I know, Chief. I have three daughters of my own.

500
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:22,100
-我知道  阿姆斯壮呢?  -他正在和瓦列霍警局通话
Yeah, I know. Where's Armstrong? -He's on the phone with Vallejo.

501
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:24,030
我们需要你们的资料
We're playing catch up, Jack.

502
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,700
我想见见生还者  麦克・梅休
I'd like to set up a meeting with your survivor, Michael Mageau.

503
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,140
没办法  他走人了
I can't. He skipped town.

504
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:31,300
唯一看见凶手真面目的人失踪了?
The only guy who's seen Zodiac without a mask is missing?

505
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,410
在医院我们有整天让他指认
When he was still in the hospital we could show him lineups all day long.

506
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,740
-但是他一出院就落跑了  -是吗  为什么?
-As soon as he got out, he split. -Really? Why?

507
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,250
我猜他不想被拖下水
I don't think he wanted to have anything to do with this.

508
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,510
你能寄来手上有的资料吗?
Can you send us everything that you have?

509
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:44,450
这应该是双方面的吧
Well, the road goes both ways.

510
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,150
我们需要计程车上采到的指纹
Now, we need that print you lifted from the cab

511
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,660
还有嫌犯那封信的笔迹
and we should have been in on the handwriting.

512
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,890
抱歉  事情发生得太快
I apologize. Things have been moving fast.

513
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,660
那帕那里该跟谁联络配合?
Who should I talk to in Napa so we can coordinate?

514
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,100
找肯恩・纳尔罗
Talk to Ken Narlow.

515
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,260
我们应该拿到嫌犯的笔迹
We really should have been in on the handwriting.

516
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,910
抱歉  事情发生得太快
I apologize. Things have been moving fast.

517
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,270
-我们需要犯罪现场的照片  -办不到
-Listen, we're gonna need your scene photos. -Can't help you.

518
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,610
肯恩  我不想跟你争管辖权
Ken, I don't want to get into a jurisdictional thing here.

519
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,010
不是啦  是我们没有犯罪现场
No, no, no, no, no. We didn't have a crime scene.

520
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:11,550
巡警几乎把现场彻底破坏了
The ranger that found the kids literally swept everything into a picnic blanket.

521
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,380
-我们只采集到一些鞋印  -什么?
-All we have are the Wing Walker prints. -The what?

522
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,820
往返犯罪现场十号半男用长靴
Boot prints to and from the crime scene were made by size 10-and-a-half Wing Walkers,

523
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:21,690
军用品专卖店才买得到的军靴
military-style boots sold only at military PXs

524
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,920
特别设计用来行走在机翼
designed to walk on the wings of planes.

525
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,570
你得有军用识别证才能购买
And you can't buy at a PX without a military ID,

526
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,760
所以嫌犯有可能是职业军人
so our suspect could be military.

527
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,270
-你们有因此缩小范围吗?  -有
-Did you guys narrow your list off of this? -Yeah.

528
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,960
-瓦列霍警方呢?  -不知道
 -Did Vallejo? -I don't know.

529
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,010
那不是我的辖区
I don't work in Vallejo. I work here.

530
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,947
我需要那些鞋印的照片 
Great. I'm gonna need photos of those boot prints. 

531
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:39,010
 好  你先把那封信寄过来
Sure, if you send me the handwriting.

532
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,840
鉴识组不是寄了备份吗?
I thought Questioned Documents already did.

533
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,810
没  瓦列霍警局有收到  我们没有
Nope. Vallejo's got them, not us.

534
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:46,390
我会请他们K算了  我电传给你
All right. I'll have Questioned Documents. Forget it. I'll telefax it to you.

535
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,180
我们没有电传机
We don't have telefax yet.

536
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,790
-好  我立刻邮寄过去  -我们也会寄出资料
-Okay, I'll put it in the mail. -We'll mail ours, too.

537
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,050
打给穆拉斯  或许他能给你油印的
And call Mulanax in Vallejo. Maybe he can get you a mimeo.

538
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:57,060
何不直接要石膏模的照片?
Right. Why don't you just get a photo off the original plaster cast?

539
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,600
还要等  因为他们没有电传机
We'd have to wait, because they don't have a fax.

540
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,290
我们也没有
We don't have a fax, either.

541
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,961
我只希望彼此能互相配合  
Look, I'm just trying to get us coordinated.

542
00:39:02,962 --> 00:39:04,560
你打给索拉诺的警长办公室了吗
 Have you called Solano Sheriff's Office?

543
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,430
为什么要打到索拉诺?
Why would I call Solano?

544
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,810
因为去年圣诞节的命案  隶属索拉诺辖区
Because the two kids that got killed last Christmas were Solano's.

545
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,970
-我以为他们在瓦列霍的辖区  -不对  犯罪现场在边界
-I thought they were Vallejo. -No, they were over the county line

546
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:16,450
-你必须和双方配合  -好吧
so you're gonna need to coordinate with them, too. -Okay.

547
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,250
比尔  我能和你说句话吗?
Bill. Can I have a word with you?

548
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,350
你在哪里看到这家伙?
Where did you see this guy?

549
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:28,590
我们奉命去那里找一名男性黑人
We got the call to circle the scene and look for a Negro male adult.

550
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,060
当时他在哪里?
Where was he?

551
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:33,170
杰克森街  往东差不多半条街
On Jackson. Heading east. About the middle of the block.

552
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:36,060
-枪击案发生后三分钟左右  -差不多
-And this is three minutes after the shooting? -Give or take. Yeah.

553
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,900
-你们往东还是往西?  -我们往西
-And you were heading east or west? -We were going west.

554
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,730
你们当时在西向杰克森街
All right, so you're on Jackson going west.

555
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:43,670
计程车在西南方一条街口外
So the cab was one block catty-corner southwest?

556
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:44,830
是的
Correct.

557
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:47,640
-你有慢下来吗?  -我们当然有慢下来
-Did you slow down? -Of course we slowed down.

558
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,940
勤务中心说嫌犯是男性黑人
All right.Listen, Dispatch said it was a Negro male.

559
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,310
后来更正了
That was corrected.

560
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:54,010
我们发现他时还没更正
No, but at the time they hadn't changed it.

561
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:57,990
而且他是白人  看来不赶时间  步伐又很笨重...
This guy was white. Right, not in a hurry. Kind of lumbering along like...

562
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,860
步伐笨重?  什么意思?
Lumbering? What do you mean, lumbering?

563
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,720
-拖着脚走路  -健壮结实  平头吗?
-Shuffling. -Stocky? Had a crew cut?

564
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,270
对  没有错
Yeah, that's all correct.

565
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:11,970
听着  当时很暗  他又穿着深色夹克
Listen, it was dark. The guy was wearing a dark jacket.

566
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,370
-根本无法...K  -他可能全身沾满了血
-There's no way... -He would have been covered in blood.

567
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,640
你有拦下他?
Did you stop him?

568
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,510
有没有问他话?
Did you talk to him?

569
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,050
-有?  没有?  -没有
-Yes? No? -No.

570
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,650
去找人划张素描
You need to get with a sketch artist.

571
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,310
立刻把新的嫌犯划像发布出去
We have to put out a new composite right away.

572
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,930
旧金山目前累计五名被害人
Five persons have been murdered in the San Francisco area,

573
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,090
(两天后-加州  旧金山)

574
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,250
而每起案件K
and in each case the killer...

575
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,660
我要在早上向一辆校车下手K
I shall wipe out a school bus some morning...

576
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,930
旧金山警方K
San Francisco police...

577
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,870
本周日滚石乐团举行演唱会K
to see the Stones in concert this Sunday.

578
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,030
<旧金山纪事报>收到K
The new letters from the Zodiac Killer were sent to

579
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:52,270
来自黄道带的最新信件
the City room of the San Francisco Chronicle.One of the letters was...

580
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,310
别在我背后偷瞄
Looming. No looming.

581
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,320
-你有想过水理论?  -什么?
-Have you considered the water theory? -What?

582
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:01,790
犯罪现场不是在水边  就是死者姓名与水有关
Geographically, every attack takes place near a body of water or a water-based name.

583
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,950
-这就是你的水理论  -贝瑞莎湖  蓝石泉
-This is your water theory? -Lake Berryessa. Blue Rock Springs.

584
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,360
-赫曼湖  -滑  盛顿和樱桃街口?
-Lake Herman. -Wash-ington and Cherry?

585
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:12,090
-你觉得呢?  -不合理
-You think? -No.

586
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,600
我在读这本<谋杀案调查>
I'm reading this book,

587
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,360
-李蒙奈史奈德着  -是李摩
-Homicide Investigation by Lemoyne Snyder -Leymone.

588
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,940
他说要从犯案模式着手调查
and he says you look for patterns,So I'm looking for patterns.

589
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:21,270
不  这不是件普通的刑事案件
No. You can't think of this case in normal police terms.

590
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,710
-为什么不是?  -有四个案发现场
-Why not? -You got four crime scenes.

591
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,710
索拉诺  瓦列霍  贝瑞莎和这里
Solano, Vallejo, Berryessa, and here.

592
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,650
前三个案发地点以及信件  都没有采到有效的指纹
Not a single usable print at the first three or in any of the letters?

593
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:34,220
这个犯罪天才为什么会突然跑来  留下一枚沾血指纹?
How does our master criminal come to the city and leave a bloody latent?

594
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:36,550
假设手套是嫌犯的
I mean, assuming the gloves are his,

595
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,060
难道他杀了司机后又脱下来?
he shoots the cabbie and then takes them off?

596
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,220
所以那不是他的指纹?
So it's not his print?

597
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,460
或许是或许不是  这不是重点  重点是第一起谋杀案...
Maybe, maybe not. You're missing the point. The point is the first attack...

598
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:46,190
-大卫法瑞戴和贝蒂珍森  -双双身亡
-David Faraday and Betty Jensen. -They both die.

599
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,700
他之后就只杀害女性
From there on out, he only manages to kill the girls.

600
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:51,130
-他并不是没尽力  -并不是
-Not for lack of trying. -Not for lack of trying.

601
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:54,870
梅休存活  费伦死亡  哈特奈尔生还  薛伯没有
Mageau lives, Ferrin dies. Hartnell lives, Shepard dies.

602
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,170
他对女人特别投入  忘了要杀死男人
He gets so caught up with the women he forgets to finish off the men.

603
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,680
加上他们是在野外约会的情侣
Plus, they're all couples and all on lover's lanes.

604
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,540
-保罗史坦就不是  -没错
-Paul Stine is not. -Exactly.

605
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,880
单身男性司机不符合这些条件
Single, male cab driver on Washington and Cherry doesn't fit.

606
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,780
不符合
Doesn't fit.

607
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,880
那么黄道带为什么要杀他?
So, why does Zodiac kill him?

608
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:14,520
他在改变犯案模式
He's breaking the pattern.

609
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:26,230
-喂?  -有人自称是黄道带
-Yeah? -Someone claiming to be Zodiac

610
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,140
半小时前打给奥克兰警局
called Oakland PD a half-hour ago.

611
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:29,470
(两天后-加州  旧金山  1969年10月22日)

612
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,670
他说三小时后  会叩应吉姆・顿巴的现场谈话节目
He says he's gonna call in on Jim Dunbar's morning show in three hours.

613
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:34,750
-在电视上吗?  -他要梅尔文・贝利当他的律师
-On television? -He wants Melvin Belli on to counsel him.

614
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,380
好  快把梅尔文叫醒
All right. All right. Let's go wake up Melvin.

615
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,320
卡通动物饼干?
Animal crackers?

616
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,080
在置物箱
Glove box.

617
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,880
这些是防弹车窗吗?
Are these windows bulletproof?

618
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,490
对  梅尔文  你不必躺在下面
Yes, Melvin. You don't have to lie down back there.

619
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:51,620
这家伙是枪神  随时都能让我一枪毙命
This man is a marksman, could snuff me out at a moment's notice.

620
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,130
-你确定你行吗?  -不用担心我  警探
-Are you sure you're up for this? -Don't you worry about me, Inspector.

621
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,500
灯光一亮我就会没事了
I'll be fine when the lights are on.

622
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,570
这个男人向我求救
This man has asked for my help.

623
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,900
你担心的那个  随时可能射杀你的男人
The man you're worrying about snuffing you out?

624
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,340
这些是什么  饼干?
What are these, cookies?

625
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:07,570
老天爷  你有清过车子吗?
Dear Lord, do you ever clean this car?

626
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:12,080
可恶  其它新闻台得到消息了
Shit. KGO must have tipped other stations.

627
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,790
让他说话  说服他跟你见面
Get him talking. Convince him to meet you somewhere.

628
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:27,900
如果你有机会  请他到中国城圣犸利教堂碰面
If you see an opportunity, we want you to suggest Old St. Mary's Church in Chinatown.

629
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:29,470
你们会追踪电话?
You'll be tracing the call?

630
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,440
你要让他在线上十五分钟以上
Pacific Telephone says you need to keep him on the line for 15 minutes.

631
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,470
应该可以  对吧  吉姆?
We can do that, can't we, Jim?

632
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,140
十五秒  清空摄影棚
Fifteen seconds. Clear the set.

633
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:49,110
拿去吧  你这个醉鬼
Here you go, you drunken reprobate.

634
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:51,780
我们要中断节目插播一则新闻
We interrupt our regular program to bring you this news bulletin.

635
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,190
欢迎收看本集特别节目  现场邀请黄道带
Welcome to this special edition of our show in which we are joined by attorney Melvin Belli

636
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,420
亲自指定的律师  梅尔文律师
who the Zodiac Killer personally requested to appear.

637
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,590
快吃完  然后放到水槽
Finish up, buddy, and put it in the sink.

638
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:04,570
-早安  梅尔文  -早安  吉姆
-Good morning, Melvin. -Good morning, Jim.

639
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,940
电话线已开放  贝利也在现场
So, the phone lines are open. Mr. Belli is here.

640
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:11,040
-我很乐意帮忙  -没错  你是来帮忙
-Here to help, Jim. -Yes. Here to help.

641
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:16,710
请民众不要拨打占线  好让黄道带本人可以和我们连线
And we ask the public not to call in, so that the Zodiac himself can reach us.

642
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:27,450
我看了你演出  <星际迷航记>  演得很棒
I saw your Star Trek, by the way. It was excellent.

643
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:31,930
可惜停播了  工作人员都很好
A shame about the show. Good people.

644
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,130
我常常考虑成为全职演员
You know, I've often thought of becoming an actor full-time.

645
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,730
-你的角色叫什么?  -戈耳冈
What was your character's name? -Gorgon.

646
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:40,030
戈耳冈  没错
Gorgon. That's right.

647
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:45,340
-快录音  开始录音  -我们接到电话  准备上现场
-Roll the tape. Get the tape. -Jim, we have a call. We're going live.

648
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,640
喂?
Hello?

649
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:54,420
你好  这是梅尔文・贝利
Hello? This is Melvin Belli.

650
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,960
请问你是谁?
Who am I speaking with?

651
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,360
我是黄道带
This is the Zodiac speaking.

652
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:06,720
你有没有别的名字?  比较没这么恐怖的
Is there something I can call you that's a little less ominous?

653
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,830
山姆
Sam. Sam.

654
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:16,080
我们可以在什么地方见面谈一谈吗  山姆?
Is there somewhere we can meet, Sam, and talk about this?

655
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:19,830
在费蒙特宾馆楼顶见我
Meet me on top of the Fairmont Hotel.

656
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:21,700
自己来否则我会跳楼自杀...
Without anyone else or I'll jump...

657
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,600
马上派人去费蒙特宾馆
Have a unit go to the Fairmont Hotel.

658
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,870
-山姆  -是的
-Sam. -Yes?

659
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:29,940
山姆  你认为你需要医疗协助吗?
Do you think you need medical care?

660
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:31,940
我是生了病  但不是疯子
Medical, not mental.

661
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:34,310
你的健康出了问题?
Do you have health problems?

662
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,180
我病了  我头很痛
I'm sick. I have headaches.

663
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:37,980
头痛?
Headaches?

664
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:41,780
我也有头痛  但我的颈椎治疗师把我治好了
I have headaches, too, but a chiropractor stopped them a week ago.

665
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,650
我认为我能帮助你  山姆
I think I can help you, Sam.

666
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,890
山姆?
Sam?

667
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:51,660
他知道电话会被追踪
He knows they're tracing his calls.

668
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:59,390
山姆  我们要让你知道  我们没有追踪你的电话
Sam, we'd like you to know that we are not tracing these calls.

669
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:04,530
追踪过程冗长而且复杂  短时间的通话也无法追踪
It's a long, difficult process and ineffective with these short calls.

670
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:11,340
山姆?
Sam?

671
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:16,680
我们没有追踪电话  我保证
We're not tracing these calls. You have my word.

672
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,450
好吧
Okay.

673
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:22,150
山姆  你得告诉我你的问题
Sam, you need to tell me what your problem is.

674
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:26,630
我不想进毒气室  我有头痛  杀了人就不会头痛
I don't want to go to the gas chamber. I have headaches. I kill, I don't get them.

675
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,170
他头壳坏去了
That is fucked up!

676
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:31,240
你想活  对吧?  我就是你的救星
You want to live, don't you? Well, this is your passport.

677
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,270
你头痛有多久了?
How long have you been having these headaches?

678
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,930
从我杀了那小子开始
Since I killed a kid.

679
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,580
-你有头晕现象没?  -有
-Do you have blackouts? -Yes.

680
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:42,410
-有没有痉挛?  -不  我只是头痛
-Do you have fits? -No. I just have headaches.

681
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:44,120
两三个星期前贝利先生来我台做客时
Did you attempt to call one other time

682
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,790
你有没有给他打过电话?
when F. Lee Bailey was with us two or three weeks ago?

683
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:47,910
打过
Yes.

684
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:49,830
为什么你想和贝利先生谈话呢?
And why did you want to talk to Mr. Bailey?

685
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:52,840
你为什么想要和我谈话呢  山姆?
Why do you wanna tal k to me, Sam?

686
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,900
-我不想被伤害  -他为什么打电话?
-I don't want to be hurt. -Why is he calling?

687
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,440
-我不想进毒气室  -等一下  宝贝
-Hey, just a second, buddy. -I don't wanna go to the gas chamber.

688
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:58,640
你跟我说话就不会受伤
You won't get hurt if you talk to me.

689
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:01,080
你也不会进毒气室
And you're not going to the gas chamber.

690
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:03,910
我想他们不至于判你死刑
I wouldn't think they would ask for capital punishment.

691
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:08,050
我们可以问问检察官  你要我这么做吗  山姆?
We should ask the District Attorney. Do you want me to do that, Sam?

692
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:11,460
你要我问检察官吗?
Do you want me to talk to the District Attorney?

693
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:16,560
那是什么  山姆?
What was that, Sam?

694
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,390
我没有说话
I did not say anything.

695
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:22,160
我们听到一声尖叫
We heard a scream.

696
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,370
那是我的头痛
That was my headache.

697
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:29,270
听起来你的疼痛很剧烈
You sound like you're in a great deal of pain.

698
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:33,310
我头很痛  我病的很严重
My head aches. I'm so sick.

699
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:35,310
我要杀光他们
I'm gonna kill them.

700
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:38,580
-好  -我要杀死那些孩子
-Oh, okay. -I'm gonna kill those kids!

701
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,880
太棒了
Fantastic.

702
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,430
山姆?
Sam?

703
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,490
让我们碰面  就我们两个
Let's meet and talk. Just us.

704
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:50,260
好吧
Okay.

705
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:52,900
在中国城的圣犸利教堂如何?
How about Old St. Mary's Church in Chinatown?

706
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:58,240
不  十点半在戴利市  圣文森慈善商店门口
No. In front of the Daly City St. Vincent de Paul at 10:30.

707
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:00,540
到时候见
I'll see you there.

708
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:03,900
好好保重  山姆
Take care of yourself, Sam.

709
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,210
(圣文森慈善商店)

710
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:33,200
天啊  你们这群人可真了解  私下密会的意思
My, my, my. You fellows certainly know how to put on a secret meeting.

711
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:40,180
我不想进毒气室
You know, the problem is, I don't want to go to the gas chamber.

712
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,450
我有头痛  我杀了人就不会头痛
I have headaches. I kill, I don't get them.

713
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,950
不  那不是他
No, it's not him.

714
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:48,060
这声音偏高  也比较年轻
It's the voice. The voice is too high. It's too young.

715
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:50,690
多谢你来一趟  布莱恩
All right. Thanks for coming down, Bryan.

716
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:54,020
没关系  我自己来
That's okay. I got it.

717
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:04,170
他们停止追踪了  这位没来赴约的神经病
They pulled off the trace. Our Daly City no-show called from a mental institution.

718
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:08,740
奥克兰警局接线生很确定  跟他说话的男人声音更低沉
Oakland PD's operator is sure the man she talked to had a deeper voice.

719
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:13,180
也更冷静  搞不好真的是这家伙
Calmer. Might have actually been him.

720
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,020
我要改变收藏奴隶的方法
So I shall change my way of collecting slaves.

721
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:22,920
(两周半后-加州  旧金山)

722
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:26,220
我不会再通知任何人我要犯案
I shall no longer announce to anyone when I commit my murders.

723
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,460
命案看起来会像一般抢劫  殴斗
They shall look like routine robberies, killings of anger

724
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:32,360
假造的意外K等等
and a few fake accidents, et cetera.

725
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:35,970
警方永远逮不到我  因为我远比那些笨蛋聪明
The police shall never catch me because I have been too clever for them.

726
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:39,840
警方所公布的嫌犯素描  是我犯案时的模样
I look like the description passed out only when I do my thing.

727
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,810
其余时间我则是完全不同面貌
The rest of the time I look entirely different.

728
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:47,850
我不会告诉你们我杀人时的伪装
I shall not tell you what my disguise consists of when I kill.

729
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,750
我也没有像警方说的那样
As of yet I have left no fingerprints behind me,

730
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,360
留下任何指纹
contrary to what the police say.

731
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,690
我都戴透明指尖套
I wear transparent fingertips.

732
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:01,460
你们只会采集到我指尖  涂上的两层模型黏胶
All it is is two coats of airplane cement coated on my fingertips.

733
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:05,730
恶整那两个巡警很好玩  猪头  当时我人就在公园
I enjoy needling the blue pigs. Hey, blue pig, I was in the park.

734
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:11,430
你们多叫了几辆消防车  掩盖巡逻警车的声音
You were using fire trucks to mask the sound of your cruising prowl cars.

735
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:15,270
猪头  被人戳破这些糗事  你们一定超不爽吧?
Hey, pig, doesn't it rile you up to have your nose rubbed in your booboos?

736
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,450
警方要是真以为  我会向校车下手
If you cops think I am going to take on a bus the way I stated I was,

737
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:23,380
你们真的是头壳坏了
you deserve to have holes in your heads.

738
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,120
你最好看看这玩意儿
And you need to look at this.

739
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:31,990
一袋硝酸氨肥料
Take one bag of ammonium nitrate fertilizer,

740
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,290
一加仑沙拉油  上面再洒上几袋砂砾
one gallon of stove oil, and dump a few bags of gravel on top

741
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:37,930
他说的是炸弹
Okay. It's a bomb.

742
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,360
我们得打给军方
Okay. We gotta call the Army and see if this

743
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:42,370
证实这种土制炸药的可行性
science experiment could actually work.

744
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:44,670
又有一组密码
Another cipher.

745
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,370
-这是什么时候来的?  -今天早上
-When did these arrive? -They arrived this morning.

746
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:51,640
-你打算刊登吗?  -罗伯
-Are you planning to publish? -Robert.

747
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,380
我们应该去喝一杯
We should have a drink.

748
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,180
谢谢
Thank you.

749
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:06,130
谈谈你自己  结婚了吗?
So, tell me about yourself. You married?

750
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:09,460
离婚了  两个小孩
Divorced. Two kids.

751
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:11,660
都做些什么休闲活动?
What do you do for fun?

752
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,060
我很喜欢阅读
I love to read.

753
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:17,630
-我喜欢看书  -那不是一样吗?
-I enjoy books. -Those are the same things.

754
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:20,400
干嘛翻我的垃圾?
Why you been going through my trash?

755
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:25,380
待会儿再说好了
I'll come back to that.

756
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:28,810
-你怎么知道他还会再寄密码?  -我猜的
-How did you know he was gonna send another code? -I just guessed.

757
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:31,790
-只是猜的  -第一组似乎过于简单
-Just guessed. -The first one seemed too easy.

758
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,120
好吧  再也不能视而不见了
All right, this can no longer be ignored.

759
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:35,920
告诉我  你到底喝什么东东?
-What is that you're drinking? -It's an Aqua Velva.

760
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:37,960
蓝色刮胡水调酒

761
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:40,190
如果你试了  就不会开我的玩笑了
You wouldn't make fun of it if you tried it.

762
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,740
是谁破解了密码?
But who actually cracked the code?

763
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:57,740
一对喜欢解谜的夫妻  这让我们知道黄道带是什么人?
A married couple who like puzzles. So what's that tell us about the Zodiac?

764
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:01,320
-他不是密码专家  -没错  这就像小时候上童军课
-He's no expert. -Right. It's just a simple substitution code

765
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:03,720
会用的替代编码法
like the one that we used to do as boy scouts.

766
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:07,480
-A是1  B是2  -不是每个人都上过童军课
-A is one, B is two.  -We weren't all boy scouts, Robert.

767
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:10,560
这并不难  只要先找到关键字
Well, it's not that hard. You just got to know where to start.

768
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:13,720
-第一组密码  -你竟然把密码带在身上
-In the first cipher -You actually carry that around with you?

769
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,390
-怎样?  -没怎样
-Why?  -No reason.

770
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,590
英文最常用到哪两个子音组合?
What's the most common double consonant in the English language?

771
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:21,640
-子音?  -双L
-Consonant?  -The double L.

772
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:23,640
双L
Double L.

773
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:26,440
哪个字他至少会用上一次?
And what's the one word that we know that he'll use in here, at least once?

774
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:27,770
-杀  -对  杀(KILL)
-Kill.  -Right, kill.

775
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:29,795
哈顿夫妻先找相同的两个符号 
So the Hardens start looking for double symbols,

776
00:52:29,796 --> 00:52:31,510
 找到这里K这里K还有这里
 which they find here, here, and here.

777
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,810
前面都有一样的两个符号
Each with the same two symbols preceding them.

778
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:36,813
现在他们找到好几个两个一样符号的 
So now they've got a repeating fourletter word ending 

779
00:52:36,814 --> 00:52:37,980
 四个字母的字
with two symbols that they assume stand for L.

780
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,372
他们认为这个字串是KILL 
And since they think the whole word is kill

781
00:52:40,373 --> 00:52:41,320
 有了K和I
 then...then you got your K, you got your I,

782
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:42,820
这就是个关键字
and you're on your way.

783
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:46,490
他们怎么用这两个符号  解开整个谜?
But how do you go from A is one and B is two to figuring out this whole code?

784
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:50,030
就像我一样  去图书馆查
Well, same way I did. You go to the library.

785
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,690
在这本书里K
In this book,

786
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:55,860
(<解谜大王>)

787
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,800
作者在序中提供简单的替代字
the author presents a very simple substitution code in the preface.

788
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,880
他提供的26个替代字中  就有8个在这张密码里找得到
Eight of the 26 symbols that he suggests are found in this cipher.

789
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:04,880
但这些都不是字母  看起来是中世纪符号
Yeah, but there are non-letter symbols because there's all these medieval ones.

790
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:07,210
我也这么觉得
I thought they looked medieval, too.

791
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:12,020
后来我意外发现中世纪密码  猜猜看它叫什么?
But then I found a code written in the Middle Ages. Guess what it's called?

792
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,920
黄道带字母
The Zodiac Alphabet.

793
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,550
天哪
Jesus.

794
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:20,660
-你想得到什么好处?  -什么?
-What do you want out of this?  -What?

795
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:24,490
你有什么企图?  除了你以外别人都能捞到好处
What's your angle? This is good business for everyone but you.

796
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,270
你指的好处是什么?
How do you mean business?

797
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:34,510
上床睡觉吧
Hey. Come to bed.

798
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:37,700
待会儿再睡  我得打通电话
I'll be up in a minute. I need to make a phone call.

799
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,990
-喂?  -比尔?
-Hello?  -Bill?

800
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,490
加州并没有太多的地下室
There's not many basements in California.

801
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:56,130
以后会派上用场的地下室
Basement for future use.

802
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:58,160
没错
That's right.

803
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:03,000
我会打给瓦列霍和那帕市  请规划局调查  去睡吧
I'll have Vallejo and Napa check with their city planners.Get some sleep.

804
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:04,940
好吧
Yeah, sure.

805
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,150
(一个半月后  加州  旧金山)

806
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,720
亲爱的梅尔文  我是黄道带
Dear Melvin, this is the Zodiac speaking.

807
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,350
希望你有个愉快的圣诞节
I wish you a happy Christmas.

808
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:26,020
我只想请你帮忙  请你帮助我
The one thing I ask of you is this. Please help me.

809
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:29,760
我无法向其他人求助  因为我心里的声音不肯
I cannot reach out for help because this thing in me won't let me.

810
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:30,920
谢了
Thank you.

811
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:34,370
我发现我就快要失去控制
I am finding it extremely difficult to hold it in check

812
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:38,100
我担心我一旦失去控制  就会有第九个K
and I am afraid I will lose control again

813
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,940
或第十个受害者出现
and take my ninth and possibly tenth victim.

814
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,270
梅尔文  他在向你求救
Melvin, he's reaching out to you.

815
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:47,180
一点也没错  警探  这封信直接寄到我家
Absolutely. Inspectors, he sent this letter directly to my residence.

816
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:50,320
与其说是声明不如说是求救信
It is a cry for help, intended as a private communiqué.

817
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:52,750
所以你才通知<旧金山纪事报>
Which is why you contacted the Chronicle.

818
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,820
民众有权利知道事实  来一杯?
The people have a right to know. Toddy?

819
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:58,990
-你几时收到信?  -上礼拜中旬
-When did the letter arrive?  -In the middle of last week.

820
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,660
我旅游参观去了
I was away on safari.

821
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:03,540
先生们你们圣诞节要怎么过?
What did you gentlemen do for Christmas?

822
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,960
-就像现在这样  -你一定要去非洲看看
-You're looking at it.  -You must see Africa.

823
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:11,240
文明的起源  魅力人民  漂亮  野性
Cradle of civilization. Fascinating people. Beautiful. Savage.

824
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:15,120
-拜托让我们回到杀手上来  -哦  当然
-Back to the killer who wrote to you. -Yes. Of course.

825
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,240
我相信他写这封信是因为K
It is my belief that he only penned this letter

826
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:20,080
他打到电视台或我家都找不到我
because he couldn't get through to me on the Dunbar show or here.

827
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,690
-他有试着打电话到你家?  -好几次  我都不在
-He tried to contact you here? -Several times.

828
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:25,020
他和女管家说过话
I was out, but he spoke with my housekeeper.

829
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:27,350
-没留下号码  -他一向都很狡猾
-Didn't leave a number. -He's kind of crafty like that.

830
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:29,690
-介意我跟你管家谈谈吗?  -不介意
-Do you mind if I speak to her? -Not at all.

831
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:32,230
但是这封信比较重要
But the real story is the letter.

832
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,300
-我马上回来  -好
-I'll be back. -Yeah.

833
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:37,270
-她在这里  -陶希警探
She's right this way.

834
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,810
我相信这封信  是通往他灵魂的窗口
Inspector Toschi, it is my belief this is a window into this man's soul.

835
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,740
他内心有杀戮的冲动
Killing is his compulsion.

836
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:46,610
他想忽视却无法抵抗  这是他的本性
Even though he tries to ignore it, it drives him. It's in his blood.

837
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:49,610
也许他只是想出风头
Could be. Or maybe he just likes the attention.

838
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:56,360
(一个半月后  132号公路  加州  莫德斯托附近)

839
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,150
(1970年3月22日)

840
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:39,160
我不是故意吓你  你的车子右轮胎松了
I didn't mean to scare you, but your right rear wheel is loose.

841
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:40,990
-真的吗?  -你要的话
-Really? -If you like

842
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:43,600
我可以帮你锁紧
I could tighten the lugs up for you.

843
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:50,270
-你不介意的话  -还是小心一点比较好
-If you don't mind.  -Well, you can't be too careful.

844
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:27,210
-搞定了  -谢谢
-All done. -Thank you.

845
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:30,080
不客气  祝你愉快
No problem. Have a good night.

846
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:35,850
没事
It's okay.

847
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,270
你没事吗?
Are you okay?

848
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:35,240
没事  我们没事
Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

849
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:40,690
一定比我想像的更严重  我可以载你到加油站修车
Must have been worse than I thought. I can give you a lift to a service station.

850
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:45,420
好啊
Okay.

851
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:53,930
没关系  来吧
It's okay. Come on.

852
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:04,370
我不知道你有小宝宝
I didn't know you had a baby.

853
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:07,040
可以吗?
Oh, is that okay?

854
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,140
人越多越好
The more the merrier.

855
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:22,460
你不该抽烟  这是坏习惯
You shouldn't smoke. It's a bad habit.

856
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,270
我们错过了一间加油站
I think we just passed a filling station.

857
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,430
他们打烊了
It was closed.

858
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,770
你常在晚上四处帮助别人吗?
Do you always go around helping people in the night?

859
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:44,080
等我搞定  他们就不太需要帮忙
When I'm done with them, they don't need much help.

860
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:48,720
没事的
It's okay.

861
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:51,080
在我杀你之前
Before I kill you,

862
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:53,890
我得先把你的小宝宝丢出去
I'm gonna throw your baby out the window.

863
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:12,570
不要  救命  不要!
No! Help! Please! No!

864
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,170
她人在路边
She was on the side of the road.

865
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:21,050
-她把我拦了下来  -发生什么事?
-She flagged me down. -What happened to her?

866
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:24,160
她说她跳车  我看到她的时候她就是这样
She said she jumped from a car. I found her like this.

867
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:27,320
-怎么了?  -求求你  他说...
-What is it? -Please, he said...

868
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:29,550
-一切都没事了  -他想要杀我
-It'll be okay. -Tried to kill me.

869
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,890
-我的小宝宝!  -她的小宝宝呢?
-My baby!  -Where's her baby?

870
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:35,230
我停车的时候没看到
She didn't have one when I stopped.

871
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,060
你的小宝宝呢?
Where's your baby?

872
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,100
老天爷
Jesus.

873
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:55,480
-你藏起来了?  -以防他再回来
-You hid it?  -In case he came back.

874
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:04,990
(<莫德斯托蜜蜂报>)

875
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:08,430
(女人声称被黄道带绑架)

876
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,240
我是黄道带
This is the Zodiac speaking.

877
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:12,430
(三十天后-加州  旧金山)

878
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:14,870
对了  上个密码破解了吗?
By the way, have you cracked the last cipher I sent you?

879
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,210
我有点好奇我的人头现在值多少
I'm mildly curious as to how much money you have on my head now.

880
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:21,710
希望你没以为我用炸弹
I hope you do not think I was the one who wiped out that blue meanie

881
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:22,870
(黄道带寄信  表示杀了十人)

882
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:24,780
在警局炸死那个白目巡警
with a bomb at the cop station,

883
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:27,550
虽然我说过要炸死那些学童
even though I talked about killing children with one.

884
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,120
我是黄道带
This is the Zodiac speaking.

885
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:30,350
(八天后  加州  旧金山)

886
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,820
我很想在街上看到大家  别上黄道带胸章
I'd like to see some nice Zodiac buttons wandering around town.

887
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:34,930
别人都做了胸章
Everyone else has these buttons

888
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:38,260
像是和平  黑色力量  律师吃屎之类的胸章
like peace, black power, and Melvin eats blubber, et cetera.

889
01:01:38,430 --> 01:01:41,400
我会很高兴看到每个人  都别上一枚我的胸章
It would cheer me up considerably if I saw a lot of people wearing my button.

890
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:42,590
(两个月后  加州  旧金山)

891
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:44,930
-别把标语写得太贱  -我是黄道带
-Please no nasty ones. -This is the Zodiac speaking.

892
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:46,660
(黄道带表示  他杀了旧金山警察)

893
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:51,040
我用38口径旧金山警用手枪  射杀一名驾驶
I shot a man sitting in a parked car with a .38. Zodiac 12, SFPD zero.

894
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:54,370
地图加密码提供炸弹的地点
The map coupled with this code will tell you where the bomb is set.

895
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:57,920
引爆时间是下一个秋天
You have until next fall to dig it up.

896
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:01,650
我是黄道带
This is the Zodiac speaking.

897
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:05,490
你们不别黄道带胸章让我很不爽
I'm rather unhappy because you people will not wear some nice Zodiac buttons.

898
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:06,938
我列出一张名单  
So,I now have a little list,

899
01:02:06,939 --> 01:02:08,360
从那女人和她小孩开始
starting with the woman and her baby that I gave a rather interesting ride

900
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:09,550
(四周后-加州  旧金山)

901
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:11,100
几个月前  在我烧毁她车子以前
for a couple of hours one evening, a few months back,

902
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,930
我们一同兜风了几个小时
that ended in my burning her car where I found them.

903
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:16,370
我们真的不再刊登这些信件?
We're really not gonna run any more of his letters?

904
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:20,730
新策略  警方要我们暂时不理他  看他会有什么反应
The new policy. Our brothers in blue want us to hold back and see how he reacts.

905
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:24,900
三个月来四封信  这是第一封提到凯萨琳琼斯的
Four letters in three months, and this is the first mention of Kathleen Johns.

906
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:29,810
-超奇怪的  -因为他都在讲屁话
-That's very weird. -That's because he's full of shit.

907
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,310
什么意思?
What do you mean?

908
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:34,920
你不知道吗?
You don't know?

909
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:41,320
欢迎  放下你身上的东西  走到第五排左转
Welcome. Please put your stuff down. You're going down five rows and left.

910
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,860
找三月份的<莫德斯托蜜蜂报>
Looking for the Modesto Bee from March.

911
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:46,860
我会站着试着不吐出来
I'm going to stand here and attempt not to vomit.

912
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:49,160
左转
Left.

913
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,570
-我要找什么?  -凯萨琳・琼斯
-What am I looking for? -Kathleen Johns.

914
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:57,440
也许你要找旧的<纪事报>...  算了  我自己来找
Also probably you wanna pull the Chron from...You know, never mind. I'll see to that.

915
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:00,810
再读这封信  关于凯萨琳
Okay, look at this letter again. The part about Kathleen Johns.

916
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:02,610
告诉我他说的事实
Tell me what facts he gives.

917
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:05,580
-女人与小孩被他绑架  -没错
-A woman and her baby abducted. -Fact.

918
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:10,580
-车子着火  -好  现在
-The car on fire. -Okay, now,

919
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:12,950
再看<蜜蜂报>的报导
look at the article from the Bee.

920
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:14,120
(女人声称被黄道带绑架)

921
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:16,720
看到了吗?
Seen it yet?

922
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:20,700
-信上写的都是发生过的事  -他以前也玩过这把戏
-Everything in the letter already appeared in the article. -And he's done it before.

923
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:24,260
员警赖理查在车上惨遭射杀
Officer Richard Radetich, shot sitting in his car.

924
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,740
黄道带也说他杀了一名驾驶
Zodiac claimed that he shot someone in their car.

925
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:31,310
几天后  这则新闻出来  嫌犯早就被逮捕
Couple days after this article came out. The police already had somebody in custody.

926
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,310
黄道带根本没犯案
Zodiac didn't do it,

927
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,640
他抢了这些人的功劳  因为他想当媒体宠儿
but took credit for it anyway because he's in it for the press.

928
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:38,840
-他甚至盗用别人的符号  -什么?
-He even stole his symbol. -What?

929
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:42,650
我给你看样东西  别告诉别人
Yeah. Shit.If I show you something, you promise not to tell anyone?

930
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:46,850
我能告诉谁?  对哦  一点也没错
-Who would I tell? -Okay. Totally solid point. Okay.

931
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:55,260
我们收到黄道带的信之前
That's the only place that word and that symbol

932
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,420
(黄道带名表)

933
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:57,930
符号与名字只同时出现在这里
ever appeared together before the letters.

934
01:03:58,110 --> 01:04:01,370
-这家伙盗用手表上的商标  -他杀了十三人...
-The guy stole his logo off a watch. -How can somebody who's killed 13 people do...

935
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:04,530
他自称杀了十三人  谁能证明?
He claims he's killed 13 people, but which ones can we actually confirm?

936
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:08,040
瓦列霍三人  贝瑞莎一人  以及计程车司机  就这样
There's three in Vallejo, one in Berryessa, the cabbie. That's it.

937
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:12,320
小葛  你好像很失望
Bobby, you almost look disappointed.

938
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:15,910
局长撤走调查此案的人员
Chief's pulling everybody off buses.

939
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:19,950
-一切恢复正常  -他一定会再出声
-Business as usual. -Something'll shake loose.

940
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:24,660
-四个月来一声也没吭  -起先他不肯住嘴  现在...
-Not a peep in four months. -First he won't shut up and now...

941
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:27,630
也许他被逼得躲起来了
Maybe we drove him underground.

942
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:29,560
也许他落跑了
Maybe he's gone.

943
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:33,330
赫特街582号发生案件  有一名男子K
311 at 582 Haight, cross at Biltmore. There's a male...

944
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:36,240
-比尔  生日快乐  -谢了
-Happy birthday, Bill. -Thanks.

945
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:43,680
(1970年10月11日  加州  旧金山  华盛顿街与樱桃街转角)

946
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:48,450
你介意别人老是叫你矮子吗?
Does it ever bother you that people call you Shorty?

947
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:50,990
你介意别人老是叫你智障吗?
Does it bother you that people call you a retard?

948
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:53,960
-没人这样叫我啊  -是啊
-Nobody calls me that. -Right.

949
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:56,960
我当选后将以州长拥有的权限K
As governor, I pledge to use all my influence

950
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:58,790
(两周半后  加州  旧金山)

951
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:01,900
把害黛琳费伦的凶手绳之以法
to make sure that Darlene Ferrin's killer is brought to justice.

952
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:06,840
我相信这起命案有些线索被忽略
I believe some clues were overlooked in the murder of Darlene Ferrin.

953
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:09,000
-我相信这是一起预谋谋杀案  -那女人是谁?
-I believe her murder was premeditated. -Who is that?

954
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:11,910
芙伦丝・道格拉斯  瓦列霍市长  她要出来竞选州长
Florence Douglas, mayor of Vallejo. She's running for governor.

955
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:14,740
我相信警方不是没钱  没时间
I believe that the police department either did not have the money, the time

956
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,470
就是懒得去挖掘真相
or, yes, the inclination...

957
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:20,550
你竟然敢批评警方  好样的  小芙
Sayonara, police endorsement. Good work, Flo.

958
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,920
有人替我取过外号吗?
Does anyone ever call me names, or...

959
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:27,490
-你是说智障吗?  -对
-You mean like retard? -Yeah.

960
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,730
没有
No.

961
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:38,670
可恶  我靠  他妈的
Shit. Fuck. Oh, my God. Jesus.

962
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:45,710
告诉我那不是一块沾血衬衫
Tell me that's not a piece of bloody shirt!

963
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:48,280
我知道你们打心里想知道我名字
I feel it in my bones, you ache to know my name

964
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:51,940
我就直接告诉你们吧  不过何必扫兴呢?
and so I'll clue you in. But then, why spoil the game?

965
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,520
万圣节快乐
Happy Halloween.

966
01:05:55,160 --> 01:06:00,180
保罗  你在一篇文章中  说他有潜在性同性恋倾向
Paul, you did call him a latent homosexual in at least one of your articles.

967
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:03,960
大卫  我需要一把枪
Dave. I want a gun.

968
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,160
一把枪?
A gun?

969
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,170
专栏作家贺伯肯恩提到你
You're in Herb Caen.

970
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:17,240
保罗艾瑞的深入调查  换来黄道带的一句警告
Paul Avery's investigation has won him the accolade of a message from the Zodiac warning,

971
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:18,740
你死定了
You are doomed.

972
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:22,250
结果记者都纷纷别上写着
As a result, several crime newsmen are wearing lapel buttons reading,

973
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:24,410
我不是保罗艾瑞  的胸章
'I am not Paul Avery.'

974
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,750
你应该去卖胸章  肯定赚翻天
You should sell these. You could do well.

975
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:29,910
从报社刊登警告信的那天起  我的确收获不少
It's been a windfall, since they published the threat on my life.

976
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:33,960
线索来自四面八方  有个家伙住在河滨市
I got the leads coming out of the woodwork. There's one guy down in Riverside.

977
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:36,290
今晚我会去找他  一起来吗?
I'm gonna drive down and see him tonight. You wanna tag along?

978
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:39,690
不了  我有个约会
No, I have a date.

979
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:42,230
-真的假的?  -河滨市这家伙是谁?
-Really? -Who is this guy?

980
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,340
他想要匿名  我想要声名狼借
He wishes to remain anonymous. I wish to remain infamous.

981
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:49,480
咱们应该会很合得来
So we're going to get along great.

982
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,380
晚安  我来找梅乐妮
Hi. Good evening. Hi. I'm looking for a Melanie.

You must be Melanie.

985
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:12,760
-那你就是罗伯!  -是的
-Which would make you Robert. -It would.

986
01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:15,870
葛列妮丝说了很多关于你的事
Glynnis told me lots about you.

987
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:18,000
-你在喝葡萄酒  很好  -是啊
-And you have wine, great. -I do.

988
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:20,730
我迟到多久了?
Great. How late am I?

989
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:24,280
几分钟而已  我也是刚到
Just a few minutes, really. I just got here myself.

990
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:27,040
路上塞车  我刚从靶场过来
Traffic's bumper to bumper. I was at the gun range.

991
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:29,370
葛列妮丝说你是个漫画家
Glynnis said you were a cartoonist.

992
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:30,950
喔  是啊
Oh, yeah.

993
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:33,610
-你去靶场做什么?  -看书
-Well, what're you doing at a gun range? -Reading.

994
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:37,850
多拿一些...K你需要多点餐巾纸
Get some more... You need some more napkins.

995
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,530
你和葛列妮丝是同事?
So, you work with Glynnis.

996
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:42,960
-其实我是替她工作  -替她工作?
-For her, actually.  -For her?

997
01:07:43,130 --> 01:07:44,790
喔  这样K
Oh, well...

998
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:48,360
我小孩很怕葛列妮丝
My children are terrified of Glynnis.

999
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:49,660
我也是
Me, too.

1000
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:56,170
-你刚才在靶场  -我们在调查...
-So, the gun range? -We're... I'm working on...

1001
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:57,870
-你知道黄道带?  -知道

1002
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,210

-I'm working with...  -Do you know who Paul Avery is?

1003
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:03,210
-有点耳熟  -他就是遭黄道带恐吓的记者
-Sounds kind of familiar. -He's the writer that the Zodiac threatened.

1004
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:07,080
-对  我在电视上有看到  -其实我跟他是同事
Oh, yeah, I saw that on TV. -Well, I work near him

1005
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:11,620
他今晚要开车到河滨市  找一位匿名密报者
and he's going down tonight to track an anonymous tipster down in Riverside.

1006
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:13,790
河滨市到底在哪里?
Where is Riverside?

1007
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:15,890
洛杉矶附近
It's near L.A.

1008
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:19,900
我猜保罗不知道路程那么远
Oh, wow. I don't think Paul knows that it's that far away.

1009
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:23,700
听起来有些危险
Sounds kind of dangerous.

1010
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:27,940
是啊  怎么说?
Yeah. How do you mean?

1011
01:08:28,110 --> 01:08:30,370
你不是说对方是个匿名密报者吗?
Well, you said it was an anonymous tip, right?

1012
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:31,870
是啊
Yeah.

1013
01:08:32,050 --> 01:08:35,880
可能是个埋伏  搞不好是黄道带
So it could be an ambush. I mean, it could be the Zodiac.

1014
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:39,450
你不觉得这么做有点傻吗?
Don't you think it's kind of stupid?

1015
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:42,350
是啊  不过保罗有把枪
Yeah, yeah. Well, Paul has a gun.

1016
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:49,400
你知道这里有什么好吃的?
So, do you know what's good here?

1017
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,460
我从来没来过这里
I've never been here before.

1018
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:57,190
意大利面?
The pasta, spaghetti?

1019
01:08:58,370 --> 01:09:00,500
可以点餐了吗?
Are you ready to order yet?

1020
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:04,340
我要点红酱管面  你能帮我改用白酱煮吗?
Yeah, I'll have the penne vodka. But could you do it in a cream sauce?

1021
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:06,100
当然可以
Of course.

1022
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,710
再给我们几分钟?
Maybe give us another minute?

1023
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:16,310
你有零钱吗?
Do you have any change?

1024
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:18,960
等等  等一下
Oh, wait, no wait, hold on.

1025
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:22,060
-没有  我只有一分钱  -你要打电话吗?
-Nope. That's a penny. -Do you have to make a phone call?

1026
01:09:22,230 --> 01:09:26,060
刚刚你提到黄道带
Yeah, you know, when you were saying that the Zodiac...

1027
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:27,760
你说很危险  我在想 
You know, when you said it was dangerous,

1028
01:09:27,761 --> 01:09:29,570
 真的很危险  而且...
 I just thought that it is dangerous, and it's...

1029
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:30,730
-很蠢?  -对
-Stupid?  -Stupid.

1030
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:36,000
所以我应该打给他太太  问问她有没有任何消息
And I just thought that I should call his wife and just see if she's heard from him.

1031
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,570
我有一些零钱
I have some change.

1032
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:01,760
好了  她说有消息会再打给我
Okay. Well, she said she'd call when she heard from him.

1033
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:04,270
-很好  -对
-Good.  -Yeah.

1034
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:09,030
梅乐妮  我应该回家等电话
Melanie, I should really go home and wait for the call.

1035
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:14,310
你该不会想骗我跟你回家吧?
Is this some sleazy plan to get me to go home with you?

1036
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,270
什么?  不是!
What? No.

1037
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,750
食物就打包好了
I'll get the food to go.

1038
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:24,650
喂!
Hello!

1039
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:43,770
嗨  我约了人在这里见面
Hi! I'm supposed to meet somebody here.

1040
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:03,260
有消息吗?
Anything?

1041
01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:08,730
-你不用留下来陪我  -别开玩笑了
-You don't have to stay. -Are you kidding?

1042
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:12,800
这是我最棒的一次约会
This is the most interesting date I've ever had.

1043
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,030
-保罗?  -罗伯?
-Paul? -Robert?

1044
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:19,700
-是啊  -你坐着吗?
-Yes. -You sitting down?

1045
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:22,870
-是啊  -你绝对不会相信
-Yes. -You're not gonna believe this.

1046
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:24,740
-大卫!  -离奇的转折
-Dave! -In a bizarre twist,

1047
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,680
猎物变成猎人
the hunted has become hunter.

1048
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:30,550
<旧金山纪事报>记者  也就是黄道带猎杀目标保罗・艾瑞
San Francisco Chronicle reporter and Zodiac target Paul Avery

1049
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,880
声称找到新的线索
claims to have uncovered new information

1050
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:36,720
针对河滨市唯一未破的谋杀案
regarding the only unsolved homicide in Riverside County's history,

1051
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:40,300
艾瑞深信  1966年南加州的谋杀案
a 1966 Southern California murder,

1052
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:44,060
很可能是黄道带的第一名受害人
that Avery now believes was the Zodiac's first victim.

1053
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:45,570
-什么?  -他没告诉你吗?
-What? -He didn't call you about this? -Hang on!

1054
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:48,230
-等等  -我把河滨市凶手寄给媒体的信件
The Riverside killer wrote to the press letters

1055
01:11:48,410 --> 01:11:51,470
亲自拿给鉴识专家进行比对
that I then took personally to the Office of Questioned Documents.

1056
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,580
专家怎么说?
And what did this expert tell you?

1057
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:55,440
就像我早就知道的答案一样
What I knew in my gut, Ron.

1058
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:57,810
两封信笔迹相同
The handwriting matches Zodiac's.

1059
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,040
他怎么拿到河滨市的证物?
How'd he get the evidence out of Riverside?

1060
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:02,520
王八蛋  没想到他会来这招
He took it to Sherwood without telling us, the son of a bitch.

1061
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:06,390
-你知道我们有多糗吗?  -我们怎么确定这条线索是真的?
-You know how bad this looks? -Hey, how do we know that this lead is real?

1062
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:11,020
当然是真的  我怎么知道?  因为是从电视上看到的
It's very real. You know how I know? Because I saw it on TV.

1063
01:12:12,530 --> 01:12:15,900
(1970年11月18日)

1064
01:12:19,810 --> 01:12:22,270
你认识倪梅尔  司法部调查员
Dave, you know Mel Nicolai. He's working the case for Justice.

1065
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,770
幸会  梅尔
Good to see you, Mel.

1066
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:27,240
谁能告诉我为何我得透过媒体
All due respect, can someone explain to me why I'm reading about breaks in this case

1067
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:29,400
才知道这案子有新的线索?
in the Chronicle instead of getting calls from you?

1068
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:31,140
-我们被整了  -大卫  少来这套
-We got screwed. -Dave, come on.

1069
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:33,750
你也常上报  民众会提供线索
You do get your name in the paper a lot. People talk.

1070
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,950
我从来没有公开讨论案情
I don't ever talk about an open investigation, period. Okay, Ken?

1071
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:40,490
大卫吗?  嘿  嗨!  保罗・艾瑞
Dave? Hey. Hi. Paul Avery.

1072
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:44,650
-我可以搭你的便车去?  -保罗  不行
-Can I catch a ride with you gents when we get there? -Not a good idea, Paul.

1073
01:12:44,830 --> 01:12:48,360
去同一个地方还要我搭计程车
He's gonna make me take a cab when we're going to the same place.

1074
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:50,870
感谢您搭乘太平洋西南航空
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for choosing PSA.

1075
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:53,370
好吧  好吧
Fair enough. Fair enough.

1076
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:56,060
请注意  吸烟区在最后六排
Remember, smoking is in the last six aisles only.

1077
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:58,340
祝您旅途愉快
Enjoy your flight.

1078
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:01,740
(两小时后  加州  河滨市)

1079
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:04,000
-克劳斯?  你好  -嗯
-Cross? Hi. -Yeah.

1080
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,370
-我是侦探大卫  托希奇  旧金山警局  -你好?
-Detective David Toschi, SFPD. -How are you doing?

1081
01:13:06,370 --> 01:13:08,000
好  谢谢你们的协助
Great. Thanks for having us down today.

1082
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,580
没问题  我听说你给我们带来了些资料
Not at all. I hear you have some files for us.

1083
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:12,200
我给你看我的  你给我看你的
I'll show you mine. You show me yours.

1084
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,580
-旧金山是吧?  -是的  旧金山
-Frisco huh? -That's right. San Francisco.

1085
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,750
-纳巴市的肯  那罗  -肯
-Ken Narlow from Napa. -Ken.

1086
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:18,580
-司法部的梅尔  尼克莱  -梅尔
-Mel Nicolai, Justice. -Mel.

1087
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:19,610
这是我们所知道的
Here's what we know.

1088
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:22,240
贝特兹曾就读河滨市社区大学
Cheri Jo Bates attended Riverside Community College.

1089
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:25,940
1966年10月30日那晚  她在图书馆念书
She studies in the library the night of October 30th, 1966.

1090
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,490
九点钟关门后她与一名男性离开
She leaves with an unidentified male at closing, 9:00 p.m.

1091
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:34,410
隔天她被发现在停车场  被刺杀身亡
Her body's found the next morning in a parking lot, stabbed to death.

1092
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:35,830
她的车被弄坏
Her car is disabled.

1093
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:38,870
有人把点火器的线路切断  电池不起作用
Someone cut the coil in the distributor, the battery died.

1094
01:13:38,870 --> 01:13:41,370
就有人过来  假意帮忙
The someone comes back, offers to help.

1095
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:43,620
-就像凯瑟琳・琼斯那样  -谁?
-Like Kathleen Johns. -Who?

1096
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:46,370
莫德斯托郊区的一个女的  可能是黄道带的受害者
A woman outside of Modesto, might be a Zodiac victim.

1097
01:13:46,370 --> 01:13:50,000
可能  可能是  我这里有她的一些资料
Might. Might be. I have her comp right here in this file.

1098
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,280
好的
Okay.

1099
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:54,630
11月29日  案发一个月后
A typewritten confession was sent to the Riverside Press Enterprise

1100
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,290
<河滨市企业报>收到打字的自白书
on November 29th, a month after Bates's murder.

1101
01:13:57,470 --> 01:13:59,130
报社刊登这封自白书
They ran it.

1102
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:03,710
我没有病  我只是疯了  但游戏不会终止
I'm not sick. I am insane. But that will not stop the game.

1103
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,930
这封信应该公开给大众阅读
This letter should be published for all to read.

1104
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:09,340
他要公开  他说这是游戏  这可能就是黄道带
He wants to be published. He calls it a game. I mean, this could be our boy.

1105
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:12,510
半年后  警方  父亲和报社
Six months later, the police, the girl's father, and the paper,

1106
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:14,650
都收到了这些信
they all received these.

1107
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:21,350
双倍邮资  黄道带的习惯
Double postage, just like Zodiac.

1108
01:14:21,530 --> 01:14:22,520
(贝特兹该死)

1109
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:25,560
这是莫瑞尔用来比对的信?
These are what Sherwood Morrill matched the Zodiac letters?

1110
01:14:25,730 --> 01:14:27,430
除了这些还有这块桌面  唐
These and the desktop. Don.

1111
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:32,400
几个月后工友在校园的仓库  发现这块桌面
This was found a couple of months later by a janitor in RCC storage.

1112
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:41,170
(切  清洁  如果血液鲜红/清洁  血液泼洒在她的新洋装)

1113
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:44,710
莫瑞尔用桌面比对字迹?
Sherwood got a handwriting match off wood?

1114
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:47,680
谁会刻上自己的笔迹?
Who etches in their own handwriting?

1115
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:51,380
老实说  我看不出笔迹很像
To be honest with you, our letters and your letters, I don't see it.

1116
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:54,390
保罗・艾瑞怎么拿到信件的拷贝?
How did Paul Avery get his hands on the exemplars?

1117
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,590
是我给他的  前几天打电话聊了一个钟头
I gave them to him. We talked on the phone the other day for about an hour.

1118
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,960
-我告诉他你会来  -你跟他说我们要碰面?
-And I told him you were gonna be here. -You told him we were meeting?

1119
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:03,570
对  我也说这不是黄道带
Yeah. I also told him we don't think this is Zodiac.

1120
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:06,640
等等  你不觉得这是黄道带?
Okay, wait a minute. You don't think this is Zodiac?

1121
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:08,300
我们另外锁定一名嫌犯
We got a guy we like for it.

1122
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:11,340
虽然没有足够的证据  不过我很确定凶手就是他
We don't have enough to pin it on him yet, but we're pretty sure it's him.

1123
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:14,410
既然你认为不是黄道带  那干嘛把证物交给艾瑞?
If you don't think this is Zodiac, then why give anything to Avery?

1124
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:17,170
-我只是想合作  -你合作的方式是K
-I'm trying to cooperate. -Oh, that's how you cooperate?

1125
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:19,180
把证物交给记者?
By giving information to reporters?

1126
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:22,150
我不懂笔迹  但莫瑞尔很确定
Look, I don't know about the handwriting, but Sherwood says it's a match, right?

1127
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:25,810
就假设你的嫌犯杀了贝特兹  他打了一封自白书
So, let's just say that your guy did Cheri Jo. He types the confession.

1128
01:15:25,990 --> 01:15:29,260
黄道带在报纸上看到  然后再写信抢功劳
Zodiac reads it in the paper, and he writes a letter taking credit for it.

1129
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:33,450
-他干过这种事  -现在你有我们所有的证据
-Now, that's something he's done before. -Look, now you have everything we have.

1130
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:36,960
不过我看你们是白跑一趟
But, in my opinion, you guys came south for nothing.

1131
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:39,230
完了  大家  真的完了
FUBAR, gentlemen, FUBAR.

1132
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:42,000
不管怎么说  可能还是黄道带
I don't care what he says. This still could be Z.

1133
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:45,140
问题是全加州都这么想吧
The problem is the entire state already thinks it is.

1134
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:48,370
跟你的公关说吧
Well, there's your press agent. Talk to him about it.

1135
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:53,410
我不是来惹麻烦的
I come in peace. I don't want any trouble.

1136
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:56,450
我懒得理你  保罗  只是尽我的职务
I really don't want to talk to you right now, Paul. Not now. Just trying to do my job.

1137
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:59,320
是吗?  你害我办不了案
Oh, really? Well, now I can't do mine.

1138
01:15:59,490 --> 01:16:01,508
光处理这些线索就够头痛 
We're already screwed with the amount of tips 

1139
01:16:01,509 --> 01:16:03,190
 现在你又吓坏全加州
we got on this thing,and you just freaked out the entire state.

1140
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:06,500
那帕  瓦列霍  司法部  都怀疑我的能力
I have got Napa, Vallejo, and DOJ looking at me sideways

1141
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:09,270
河滨市则认为我白跑一趟
and Riverside's telling me I'm on a snipe hunt!

1142
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,610
贝特兹是我给你的线索
Jesus. Hey, Cheri Jo Bates was a gift. I gave that to you.

1143
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:13,870
你们俩根本查不出来
You and Armstrong never would have found her.

1144
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:16,140
他可能不是黄道带  你在乎吗?
This may not be Zodiac. Does that matter to you?

1145
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:19,690
你可能害河滨市无法起诉嫌犯
matter that Riverside may not be able to make a case against their suspect because of you?

1146
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:22,520
我费尽工夫引蛇出洞
Tell it to Sherwood. I'm out here, beating the bushes, trying to draw him out.

1147
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:25,420
-我们在同一阵线耶  -谁跟你同一阵线?
-We're in this together. -No, we're not in anything together, Paul,

1148
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:27,675
我没兴趣增加报纸发行量  
Because I'm not interested in upping my circulation.

1149
01:16:27,676 --> 01:16:29,760
他写信给我  威胁我的性命
 Oh, boy. He wrote me. He threatened my life.

1150
01:16:29,930 --> 01:16:33,870
神探  你查了一年半还抓不到人
Hey, Bullitt! Been a year-and-a-half, you gonna catch this fucking guy or not?

1151
01:16:37,770 --> 01:16:40,000
-去你的  -非常乐意接受
-Go fuck yourself. -Happily.

1152
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:42,170
你应该先告知我的  保罗
You should have called me, Paul.

1153
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:49,380
谢谢
Thank you.

1154
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:57,680
(黄道带命案获得新证物  与河滨市命案有关)

1155
01:17:02,230 --> 01:17:03,860
-你看到吗?  -看到了
-Did you see this? -Unfortunately, yes.

1156
01:17:04,030 --> 01:17:06,830
全加州的疯子都来了
Here comes every lunatic in California.

1157
01:17:07,670 --> 01:17:10,570
-我就是黄道带  -你是怎么杀害被害人的?
-I'm the Zodiac. -And how did you kill your victims?

1158
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:13,610
用枪  不  用铁捶
With a gun. No, with a hammer.

1159
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:16,680
我只能说他仍在政府机构上班
All I'm authorized to tell you is that he's still under government employment.

1160
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:19,680
-谁准许你告诉我这些?  -我只能说这么多
-And who authorized you to tell me this? -That's all I'm authorized to say.

1161
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:21,940
只有安德烈
Only a little rat bastard like Andre

1162
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,420
会切下被害人的手臂
could have done something like cut off all the victims' hands.

1163
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:26,820
黄道带没有切断任何人的手臂
Zodiac didn't cut off any of the victims' hands.

1164
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:28,720
-你确定吗?  -是的
-Are you sure? -Yes, sir.

1165
01:17:28,890 --> 01:17:31,450
我跟崔维斯一起工作快十年
Travis and I worked here side by side for 10 years.

1166
01:17:31,630 --> 01:17:35,290
命案是从他的脚被辗断后开始的
His foot gets crushed in an accident and the killings begin.

1167
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:36,620
这是巧合吗?
Coincidence?

1168
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:39,200
-我不知道  -你是警察耶  想也知道
 -I don't know. -You're a cop, man. Do the math.

1169
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:46,970
你有想过凶手或许是保罗艾瑞
Have you considered the killer might be Paul Avery?

1170
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:48,510
常常想
Frequently.

1171
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:50,540
当时他在喝啤酒
He was drinking Coors, getting a load on.

1172
01:17:50,710 --> 01:17:53,980
然后聊到猎杀人类  就像那本书一样
Starts talking about hunting people. Like that book.

1173
01:17:54,150 --> 01:17:58,140
在枪管绑一支手电筒  就能在黑暗中行凶
Says how you can put a light at the end of a gun to use as a sight in the dark.

1174
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,550
他这么说吗?
He said that?

1175
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:01,310
(六个月后  加州  托伦斯  1971年7月26日)

1176
01:18:01,490 --> 01:18:03,290
对啊  所以我就问他  你打算如何脱罪?
So I asked him, How would you get away with it?

1177
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:07,390
然后他说很简单  因为我没有杀人动机
And he said, It would be easy 'cause there'd be no real motive to the thing.

1178
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:11,400
他又说他会写信给警方  自称黄道带恶整警方
Then he said he'd write letters to the police and call himself Zodiac to mess with them.

1179
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:15,470
-李喜欢恶整别人  -你确定他有说黄道带?
-Leigh liked messing with people. --You're positive he said Zodiac?

1180
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:19,230
对  我跟他说这称号很蠢
Yeah. I thought it was a stupid name. So I told him.

1181
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:22,240
他生气的说我不在乎你怎么想
He got up all upset and said, I don't care what you think.

1182
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:25,570
我想了很久  我要用这称号
I've thought about it a long time and that's the name I'm gonna use.

1183
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:28,980
你觉得他想了很久吗?
Did you feel like he'd been thinking about it a long time?

1184
01:18:29,150 --> 01:18:32,420
他丢掉学校的工作很不爽
He was raw about losing his job at the school.

1185
01:18:32,590 --> 01:18:35,560
他说要射破校车的轮胎
He talked about shooting out the tires of a school bus

1186
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:38,020
对那些  可爱的小孩  下手
and picking off the little darlings.

1187
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:41,860
-他真的说了这些话?  -就是这些话才让我记忆深刻的
-He actually used those words? -That's what made me remember.

1188
01:18:42,030 --> 01:18:46,560
后来我跟老婆说我不想再见到他了  我就没再见过他
Afterwards, I told my wife I didn't wanna see him again. And I haven't since.

1189
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:48,900
还有一件事  李喜欢潜水
Other thing is, Leigh's into skin diving.

1190
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:51,460
他去过那座湖好几次
I know he's been up to that lake a bunch of times.

1191
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:53,840
瑞莎湖  你跟他去过吗?
Lake Berryessa? Did you ever go with him?

1192
01:18:54,010 --> 01:18:57,570
几次吧  我们也到附近的布达溪钓鱼
Couple times. We went fishing by Putah Creek near there.

1193
01:18:57,750 --> 01:19:01,880
告诉他你几时想到是他的
Tell him when you put it together.

1194
01:19:02,050 --> 01:19:04,420
大约是一年前  在报上开始报导黄道带
About a year ago, in the paper, there was a story about the Zodiac.

1195
01:19:04,590 --> 01:19:07,250
我就回想起来了  我试着打给地方警察
And it all comes back. I tried to call the local cops.

1196
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:10,410
-他们不理他  以为他疯了  -你确定
-They blew him off. Thought he was a nut. -And you're sure

1197
01:19:10,590 --> 01:19:12,920
有关黄道带的谈话
the conversation you had about Zodiac

1198
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:17,000
是发生在1968年1月1日?
took place on January 1st, 1968?

1199
01:19:17,170 --> 01:19:18,720
不可能在那天之后
It couldn't have been any later.

1200
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:23,700
我1月20日要在洛杉矶开始新工作  我得搬家
I started a new job in L.A. on January 20th. I had to move.

1201
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:26,360
-我觉得不是他  这家伙...  -亚瑟李艾伦?
-This is my problem. This guy... -Arthur Leigh Allen?

1202
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:28,995
这个李先生在元旦那天跟一个钓友 
This guy, Leigh, just lays out his 

1203
01:19:28,996 --> 01:19:30,530
 透露整个犯案计划?
entire evil plan to a fishing buddy on New Year's Day?

1204
01:19:30,710 --> 01:19:33,010
也许他很生气  又喝了点酒
I don't know. He's angry, he's been drinking,

1205
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:35,670
他想了很久  这很合理
been thinking about it for a while. I can buy that.

1206
01:19:35,850 --> 01:19:38,080
那唐钱尼为什么没早点报警?
So why didn't Cheney contact us sooner?

1207
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:39,740
我查过了  他有
I checked. He did.

1208
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:43,050
第一起关于李艾伦的报案
First recorded contact with the police department about Allen

1209
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:46,790
来自波蒙纳警局1970年  1月10日他的报案没被注意
was in Pomona. January 10th, 1970. He just got lost in the shuffle.

1210
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:50,060
李有惹毛唐吗?  比如说搞上唐的老婆?
Did Cheney have anything against Allen? Did Allen screw his wife or anything?

1211
01:19:50,230 --> 01:19:54,970
我们会全面调查  不过我觉得这家伙有嫌疑
We're gonna do a full background check. But I got to tell you, I like this guy.

1212
01:19:55,570 --> 01:19:57,730
那就采集他的字迹吧
So, let's pull some handwriting samples.

1213
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:02,510
嗨  莫瑞尔有样本
Hi. I talked to Sherwood. He got the samples.

1214
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:05,110
-你吃什么?  -培根生菜蕃茄三明治
-What are you having? -BLT.

1215
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:09,820
支票存根联没用  字迹不够多
So, the check stubs are a wash. There's not enough handwriting.

1216
01:20:09,990 --> 01:20:12,650
申请表的字迹不像黄道带  但是不能证明K
The application's got more, but it doesn't look like Z's,

1217
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:14,480
他是或不是凶嫌
so he can't rule him in. But he can't rule him out, either.

1218
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:17,990
-这么说很含糊  -他需要更多笔迹样本
-Well, that's vague. -He needs more samples.

1219
01:20:18,530 --> 01:20:23,020
还有  这家伙是个变态  当梅尔从泉谷镇拿到申请表
Also, our guy is a pervert. When Mel got the application from Valley Springs,

1220
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,860
他们说李因为乱摸孩童被开除
they told him that Allen had been fired for touching kids.

1221
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:29,130
-乱摸?  -婉转的说法
-Touching? -Polite euphemism.

1222
01:20:29,870 --> 01:20:33,140
-你要怎么做?  -打几通电话
-So what do you want to do? -Make some phone calls.

1223
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:35,800
-薯条不吃了吗?  -请便
-Are you done with the fries? -Go ahead.

1224
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:39,710
你们看过黄道带的信件拷贝吗?
Did you and Mr. Cheney have a chance to look at the copies of the Zodiac letters we sent you?

1225
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:43,280
-有  有些内容挺变态的  -我们知道
-Yeah. Some of this stuff is pretty creepy. -Yeah, we know that.

1226
01:20:43,450 --> 01:20:45,780
我是说就像李一样变态
I mean, creepy like Leigh.

1227
01:20:45,950 --> 01:20:48,580
他故意拼错字  觉得很有趣
He misspells words like that. He thinks it's funny.

1228
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:50,190
那么笔迹呢?
What about the handwriting?

1229
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:53,160
我不知道  不是有专家验证吗?
I don't know. Don't you have experts for that stuff?

1230
01:20:53,330 --> 01:20:56,320
专家说字迹不能证明是同一个人
Our man at Questioned Documents says it's inconclusive.

1231
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,400
也许他用另一只手写字
Maybe he did it with his other hand.

1232
01:20:58,570 --> 01:21:02,430
那封信写得太工整  不像是用另一只手写的字
The letters are a little too neat for someone to have written with the wrong hand.

1233
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,000
-但是李就可以  对吧?  -什么意思?
-But not for Leigh, right. -What do you mean?

1234
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:09,700
他能双手并用  能用双手写字  你们不知道?
He's ambidextrous. He can write with either hand. Didn't you guys know that?

1235
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:12,210
平常艾伦都用左手写字
In everyday life, Allen uses his left hand.

1236
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:15,210
填写工作申请表  写信给朋友
Job applications, letters to friends, et cetera.

1237
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:18,050
但是他用右手写黄道带的信
But he writes the Zodiac letters with his right hand

1238
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:21,850
写出不同的笔迹让人无法比对
producing a different handwriting that he can't be linked to.

1239
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:24,290
-我们得去见这家伙  -他在哪里?
-We got to see this guy, Chief. -Where is he?

1240
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:28,190
瓦列霍  在皮诺尔的油厂工作  他老哥也在那里工作
Vallejo. He works at Union Oil in Pinole. His brother's up there, too.

1241
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:32,130
两个人都见  记得知会穆拉斯  那里是他的辖区
See them both. Make sure you call Mulanax. It is his backyard.

1242
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:35,330
是啊  河滨市警局就很合作
Oh, right, because that worked so well for us in Riverside.

1243
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:38,130
咱们不计代价乖乖合作
Cooperation, that's us, at all costs.

1244
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:45,170
(一天后-加州  罗迪欧  1971年8月4日)

1245
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:49,740
你们在这里向他问话
You can talk to him in here.

1246
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:52,440
对了  贩卖机坏了
Coke machine's busted, by the way.

1247
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:55,020
我去叫他
I'll go get him for you.

1248
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:58,520
你们要怎么进行?
So how do you guys wanna do this?

1249
01:21:58,690 --> 01:22:01,530
比尔和密告者谈过  他来发问
Well, Bill talked to the informants. He leads, we follow?

1250
01:22:02,330 --> 01:22:04,060
我没意见
It's okay by me.

1251
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:21,480
艾伦先生  我是比尔阿姆斯壮警探
Mr. Allen, I'm Inspector Bill Armstrong.

1252
01:22:21,650 --> 01:22:23,310
大卫・陶希警探和杰克・穆拉斯警官
This is Inspector Dave Toschi and Sergeant Jack Mulanax.

1253
01:22:23,490 --> 01:22:25,507
我们负责调查发生在旧金山 
We're investigating the Zodiac murders in San Francisco 

1254
01:22:25,508 --> 01:22:27,680
 以及瓦列霍的黄道带杀人事件
and Vallejo.

1255
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:29,890
请坐
Please, sit down.

1256
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:41,160
密告者说你说了一些话
The informant notified us that you made certain statements

1257
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:43,830
就在黄道带命案的十一个月前
11 months prior to the first Zodiac murder.

1258
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:46,530
是真的话  对你很不利
If they're true, they're quite incriminating.

1259
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:49,700
-你记得说过关于这些话的吗?  -没有
-Do you recall having any such conversation? -No.

1260
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:52,470
听过或看过黄道带的报导吗?
Have you ever read or heard anything about the Zodiac?

1261
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:55,780
刚上报的时候  不过之后我就没再注意了
When it was first in the paper. But I didn't follow it after those first reports.

1262
01:22:55,950 --> 01:22:57,350
为什么?
Why not?

1263
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,320
太病态了
Too morbid.

1264
01:22:59,490 --> 01:23:01,580
我跟另外一位警官也这么说
I...I told all this to the other officer.

1265
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:04,790
-哪一位警官?  -瓦列霍来的警官
-Which other officer? -From Vallejo.

1266
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:07,720
你记得他的名字吗?
Do you remember his name?

1267
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:11,230
不记得  不过就在湖边命案之后
No, but it was right after the murder at the lake.

1268
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,870
你跟那位警官说了什么?
And what did you tell this officer?

1269
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:20,500
我说那周末我去了盐岬潜水
I told him that I'd gone to Salt Point that weekend to skin dive.

1270
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:23,370
我一个人去  遇见了一对情侣
That I was alone but I met a couple there.

1271
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:26,010
你们要的话  我家有他们的名字
I have their names at home if you want them.

1272
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:29,120
-那就太好了  亚瑟  -李
-That would be great, Arthur. -Leigh.

1273
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:33,980
-什么?  -李  没有人叫我亚瑟
-What? -Leigh. Nobody calls me Arthur.

1274
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:38,050
而且我那天回家  邻居有看见我
Also, that day when I came home, my neighbor saw me.

1275
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:42,250
大约是下午四点吧  不过我忘了跟那位警察说
It was around 4:00. But I forgot to tell the other officer that.

1276
01:23:42,430 --> 01:23:45,060
-邻居的名字?  -比利怀特
-Neighbor's name? -Bill White.

1277
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:48,170
他在一星期后左右去世
He died a week or so afterwards.

1278
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:51,700
心脏病  所以我没有打给警察
Heart attack. So I didn't think to call to follow up.

1279
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:56,110
车上沾有血迹的那把刀
The knives I had in my car with the blood on them,

1280
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:59,080
是我准备晚餐时杀鸡的血迹
that blood came from a chicken that I killed for dinner.

1281
01:24:02,420 --> 01:24:05,150
-什么?  -那个周末我把刀放在车上
-What? -I had knives in my car that weekend.

1282
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:09,650
也许比尔看到才向警方检举我
Maybe Bill saw them and called the other officer on me.

1283
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:12,760
我们会调查这件事
Well, we'll be checking in on that.

1284
01:24:12,930 --> 01:24:14,830
我问你另一件事
Well, let me ask you something else.

1285
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:19,370
你在1966年间去过南加州吗?
Were you ever in Southern California at any time in 1966?

1286
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:21,560
这是关于河滨市谋杀案吗?
Is this about the Riverside killing?

1287
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:23,430
没错
Yes.

1288
01:24:23,610 --> 01:24:27,410
当时我的确去过那里  我以前常去那里
Well, I guess I was there around that time. I used to go down there a lot.

1289
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:29,910
我喜欢看赛车
I like the auto races.

1290
01:24:33,580 --> 01:24:36,020
密告者说你能双手并用
Informant says that you're ambidextrous?

1291
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:37,910
这不是真的
No, that's untrue.

1292
01:24:38,090 --> 01:24:40,450
你不能用双手写字?
You can't write with both hands?

1293
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:43,920
小时候老师有逼我学
My teachers tried to make me when I was a kid,

1294
01:24:44,090 --> 01:24:46,750
但学不来  我是左撇子
but I couldn't. I'm left-handed.

1295
01:24:46,930 --> 01:24:50,360
他还说你扬言要杀害学童
He also said that you made statements about killing school children.

1296
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:54,100
太可怕了  那真是可怕的说法
That is...That is horrible.

1297
01:24:54,270 --> 01:24:56,700
那真是可怕的说法
That is... That's a horrible thing to say.

1298
01:24:56,870 --> 01:24:59,970
你从来没有因为你猥亵学童
So, you weren't angry about being fired from Valley Springs

1299
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:02,110
而遭到开除的事感到愤怒?
for touching your students?

1300
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:14,020
我不是黄道带
I'm not the Zodiac.

1301
01:25:14,390 --> 01:25:17,590
就算是  也不会告诉你们
And if I was, I certainly wouldn't tell you.

1302
01:25:19,890 --> 01:25:22,120
不错的手表
That's a nice watch.

1303
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,260
-谢谢  -我能看吗?
-Thank you. -May I see it?

1304
01:25:27,740 --> 01:25:29,400
我能看吗?
May I see it?

1305
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:41,780
哪里买的?
Where'd you get it?

1306
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:42,940
(黄道带)

1307
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,280
两年前我妈送我的圣诞礼物
It was Christmas gift from my mother two years ago.

1308
01:25:45,450 --> 01:25:46,890
你妈真好
That's very sweet.

1309
01:25:47,090 --> 01:25:49,420
告诉我  亚瑟
So, tell me something, Arthur.

1310
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:54,590
你不记得和任何人谈过黄道带?
You don't remember anyone you might have had a conversation with regarding the Zodiac?

1311
01:25:56,200 --> 01:26:02,500
也许和瓦列霍休闲中心的  泰德或费尔谈过吧
Maybe Ted Kidder or Phil Tucker at Vallejo Recreation.

1312
01:26:02,770 --> 01:26:06,710
我不能确定  我在那里上过班...
But I couldn't be positive. I used to work there when...

1313
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:13,140
<最危险的游戏>
The Most Dangerous Game.

1314
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:16,050
-什么?  -<最危险的游戏>
-What? -The Most Dangerous Game.

1315
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:19,710
你们是为了这件事来的  对吧?  我高中最喜欢的一本书
That's why you're here, isn't it? It was my favorite book in high school.

1316
01:26:19,890 --> 01:26:23,380
描述一个人在孤岛  等船难的生还者
It's about this man who waits for people to get shipwrecked on this island.

1317
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:26,890
因为他厌倦猎杀动物  想挑战猎杀人类看看
Because he was tired of hunting animals, he hunted the people for the challenge.

1318
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:30,390
所以  人类比任何猛兽更危险
And man is the most dangerous animal of all?

1319
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:33,390
这就是整本书的主题
That's the whole point of the story.

1320
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:35,800
很棒的一本书
Great book.

1321
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:39,670
至少我是跟费尔这么说的
Or, at least, that's what I told Phil.

1322
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:47,140
我能走了吗?
May I go?

1323
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:51,550
当然
Sure.

1324
01:26:56,090 --> 01:26:59,920
-谢谢你的时间  -我很乐意协助你们
-Thanks for your time. -I'm willing to help in any way possible.

1325
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:02,360
我很期待有一天
I look forward to the day

1326
01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:06,260
当警察不再被称为是猪罗的那一天
when police officers are no longer referred to as pigs.

1327
01:27:07,070 --> 01:27:08,800
谢了
Thanks.

1328
01:27:09,370 --> 01:27:10,860
我们会再联络
We'll be in touch.

1329
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:26,520
有谁觉得他还需要被调查吗?
So does anyone think this suspect warrants further investigation?

1330
01:27:26,850 --> 01:27:29,910
这些是黄道带信件的副本
These are copies of some of the Zodiac letters that were sent.

1331
01:27:30,090 --> 01:27:31,350
(十小时后-加州  瓦列霍)

1332
01:27:31,530 --> 01:27:33,220
请你们看一看
We'd like you to take a look at them.

1333
01:27:33,730 --> 01:27:35,750
你们认为我弟弟是黄道带
You think my brother's the Zodiac.

1334
01:27:35,930 --> 01:27:39,200
-我们正在调查他  -你们会逮捕他吗?
-Well, we're looking at him. -Are you going to arrest him?

1335
01:27:39,370 --> 01:27:43,130
艾伦太太  我们不会因为  调查一个人而逮捕他
Mrs. Allen, we don't arrest people just because we're interested in them.

1336
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:46,970
-李一向都有心理问题  -他猥亵学童的事是真的吗?
-Well, Leigh's always been troubled. -Is it true about the children?

1337
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:51,580
很不幸是的  我们知道后就很少去见他
Unfortunately. We don't see him much anymore since we found out.

1338
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:54,010
你们觉得唐钱尼怎样?
What are your feelings about Don Cheney?

1339
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:57,450
唐钱尼?我旧室友?  是他连络你们的?
Don Cheney? My old roommate? Was he the one who contacted you?

1340
01:27:57,620 --> 01:28:00,920
-这是机密  -唐这个人很可靠
-That's confidential. -Well, Don's a very reliable guy.

1341
01:28:01,090 --> 01:28:04,250
他说的话  我会相信是真的
If he were to tell you something, I'd believe it to be true.

1342
01:28:04,430 --> 01:28:05,620
-这个字  -怎么样?
-This one. -What about it?

1343
01:28:05,790 --> 01:28:07,780
他用两个S拼圣诞节
Here, where he spells Christmas with two S's.

1344
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:11,990
两年前我们收到他的圣诞卡  也是同样的拼法
We got a Christmas card from Leigh a couple years ago. He spelled it the exact same way.

1345
01:28:12,170 --> 01:28:14,570
-Christ-mass  -那张圣诞卡还在吗?
-Christ-mass. -Would you still have that?

1346
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:17,470
-我可以找找看  -谢谢  太好了
-I can look for it. -Thank you. That'd be great.

1347
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,030
我们还能帮什么忙?
Is there anything else we can do to help?

1348
01:28:21,210 --> 01:28:24,040
下次李出门时他老哥会搜他房间
The brother said he would search Leigh's apartment next time he went out of town.

1349
01:28:24,210 --> 01:28:26,540
-这样就不必申请搜票  -就这一次
-That gets you around a warrant. -For the time being.

1350
01:28:26,710 --> 01:28:28,050
如果找到什么
If we do find something,

1351
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:31,650
穆拉斯会去找瓦列霍检察官  仔细搜查房子
Mulanax will go to the DA in Vallejo, and we could search the place properly.

1352
01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:34,122
我去找贝瑞莎命案两天后 
Now I got a chance to talk to the cop who interviewed 

1353
01:28:34,123 --> 01:28:35,850
 向李问过话的警官
Leigh Allen two days after the Berryessa murders.

1354
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:39,820
他不记得为什么要问他话  不过他认为李不像杀人凶手
Doesn't remember how he got onto him, but didn't think he looked like a killer

1355
01:28:39,990 --> 01:28:42,160
-所以没有继续追查  -你认为他是凶手?
-so he didn't like him for Z. -But you do?

1356
01:28:42,330 --> 01:28:45,600
-我很想当场就逮捕他  -别急  大卫
-I wish I could've taken the guy in there. -Take it slow, Dave.

1357
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:49,260
多找些线索给莫瑞尔  笔迹符合的话就罪证确凿
Try and find more stuff for Sherwood. A match'll get us farther on the warrants.

1358
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:52,430
-艾瑞在二线  -叫他去死
-Avery's on two. -Tell him to screw.

1359
01:28:52,610 --> 01:28:56,540
你要我直接说还是加点料?
You want me to communicate that verbatim or can I spice it up a little?

1360
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:08,200
真要命
Christ, kid.

1361
01:29:09,830 --> 01:29:10,870
怎么了
Yeah.

1362
01:29:10,870 --> 01:29:13,280
-保罗  我在想  -噢  上帝保佑
-Paul, I've been thinking... -Oh, God save us all.

1363
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,750
给梅尔文的信
The letter to Melvin Belli

1364
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:17,790
是路口谋杀案一年后寄出的
was sent exactly one year after the Lake Herman Road murder.

1365
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:19,620
一封给贝特兹的父亲的信
And the one to Cheri Jo Bates' father

1366
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:22,080
是在她死后六个月寄出的
was sent exactly six months after her death.

1367
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,490
-她在万圣节前一天被杀  -是的
-She was killed a day before Halloween. -Yeah.

1368
01:29:24,490 --> 01:29:26,080
你也收到了万圣节贺卡
And you received a Halloween card...

1369
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:28,790
要知道  这些都是很吸引人的新闻  罗伯特
You know, these are all fascinating pieces of news, Robert,

1370
01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:30,830
不过稍早了点
it's a bit early in the day.

1371
01:29:30,830 --> 01:29:33,700
保罗  11点了我们错过了编辑部会议
Paul, it's 11:00 and we missed Editorial.

1372
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:40,410
-对不起  我不是有意叫你的  -没关系
-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you up. -No, no, no.

1373
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:41,620
-我只是在想  -好了好了
-I just thought that... -No, no, no.

1374
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:50,150
这名嫌犯不是黄道带
This suspect is not your Zodiac.

1375
01:29:51,550 --> 01:29:54,920
样本符合支票及申请表的笔迹?
This sample matches the canceled checks and the application?

1376
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:57,250
-完全符合  -我们重新测试他的左手
-Perfectly. -So we've just retested the left hand.

1377
01:29:57,420 --> 01:29:59,550
他能双手并用
I mean, we know he's ambidextrous.

1378
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:01,880
38年来  我没看过有人双手笔迹完全不同
In 38 years, I've never seen anyone that ambidextrous.

1379
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:04,030
一定会有相同之处
Both hands would have commonalities.

1380
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:08,500
抱歉  这论点无法成立
I'm sorry. Just not gonna work.

1381
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,730
-重案组  我是陶希  -大卫  我是杰克・穆拉斯
-Homicide, Toschi. -Dave, it's Jack Mulanax.

1382
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:15,060
嗨  怎么样?
Hey. Mulanax. Yeah.

1383
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:18,300
法官不愿意发出搜索票
We struck out with the judge. He won't sign off on a warrant for Allen's house.

1384
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,140
-为什么?  -他说证据不足
-Why not? -Said it wasn't enough.

1385
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:23,110
除非找到符合的笔迹和证物...
Now, unless we bring him a handwriting match or some evidence that...

1386
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:25,180
没有搜索票怎么找到证物?
How are we gonna get evidence if we can't toss the house?

1387
01:30:25,350 --> 01:30:27,080
不知道
I don't know.

1388
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:30,620
-真的很抱歉  -不  谢谢你
-I truly am sorry. -No, no. Thank you, Jack.

1389
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:34,450
-你想怎么办?  -没有瓦列霍的证物就没辙
-What do you wanna do? -Don't know what I can do without Vallejo.

1390
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:37,650
我们需要李的右手笔迹  没有就拿不到搜索票
We need Allen's right hand. We can't get it without a warrant.

1391
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:39,950
还有其他的嫌犯吗?
Are there other guys you should be looking at?

1392
01:30:40,130 --> 01:30:43,360
-至少还有多少  -两千三百个
-Only, what? -Twenty-three hundred?

1393
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,470
好吧  就这样了
Okay, then.

1394
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:50,260
好吧  就这样了
Okay, then.

1395
01:31:17,770 --> 01:31:20,460
保罗  你写信给司法部
Paul, you wrote the Justice Department

1396
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:24,230
要求负责调查黄道带命案?
asking to be put in charge of the Zodiac investigation?

1397
01:31:24,410 --> 01:31:26,100
(一年后  加州  旧金山)

1398
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:28,800
-我只是建议  -你用报社的信纸?
-I merely suggested... -On our letterhead?

1399
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:32,940
对案情熟悉的个人或单位
...that those with intimate knowledge of the case create an information clearinghouse

1400
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,450
能够聚集在一起交换线索和想法
to promote an exchange and free flow of ideas.

1401
01:31:35,620 --> 01:31:38,380
-然后由你来主导  -还有谁比我更适合?
-And that you run it. -Well, who better than me?

1402
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:40,920
我被黄带道盯上
The marked man.

1403
01:31:41,930 --> 01:31:45,660
你想继续在报社工作  得答应我三件事  第一  戒酒
Paul, if you want to work here, I need three things. One, stop boozing.

1404
01:31:45,830 --> 01:31:48,820
第二  停止你目前在做的事
Two, stop doing whatever else it is you're doing.

1405
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:52,230
第三  忘了你这种荒谬的想法
And three, cut this nonsense out.

1406
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:55,570
亲爱的丹波顿  如果你认为
Sweetest of Templetons, if at any time

1407
01:31:55,740 --> 01:32:00,940
我杰出的工作表现  在这鬼地方不适用的话
you feel my excellent work is no longer in step with this trashy provincial rag,

1408
01:32:01,110 --> 01:32:02,700
我倒是很乐意
I'll more than happily...

1409
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:06,010
寻求其他的发展
More than happily decamp for greener pastures.

1410
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:08,010
保罗  我是认真的
Paul, I mean it!

1411
01:32:18,130 --> 01:32:20,030
-保罗?  -是
-Paul? -Yep.

1412
01:32:20,230 --> 01:32:21,700
刚刚是怎么回事?
What was that?

1413
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:24,230
编辑部的斗争
An editorial tête-à-tête.

1414
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,560
-要喝一杯吗?  -现在是早上十点耶
-Wanna grab a drink? -It's 10:00 in the morning.

1415
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:31,440
-也许可以算是早午餐  -保罗
-Late breakfast? Early lunch, or... -Paul.

1416
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:35,810
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

1417
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:37,880
不好
No.

1418
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:42,850
多谢你的慰问
Thank you for asking.

1419
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:46,280
-矮子  -是
-Shorty! -Yes!

1420
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:49,390
-出去喝一杯吧  -保罗  你要去哪里?
-Let's go out for one. -Paul, where are you going?

1421
01:32:51,330 --> 01:32:53,060
你们停止调查我小叔?
So, you moved off my brother-in-law?

1422
01:32:53,930 --> 01:32:56,020
我们申请不到搜索票
We couldn't get a warrant.

1423
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:57,600
(1972年9月7日  加州  瓦列霍)

1424
01:32:57,770 --> 01:33:00,830
去年我们安排李和社工见面
Last year we arranged for Leigh to get help from a social worker.

1425
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:05,700
他只去了两次
He only went twice. We saw him recently for the first time in nine months.

1426
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:08,840
最近我婆婆带他来看小孩  这是九个月来第一次见面
My mother-in-law brought him by to see the new baby.

1427
01:33:09,010 --> 01:33:12,000
后来我就去找社工了解状况
After he left, I went to see that social worker.

1428
01:33:12,180 --> 01:33:15,150
他不能透露病人病情  我就直接问他
He couldn't talk about a former patient, so I just asked him straight out

1429
01:33:15,320 --> 01:33:17,950
李会不会杀人
if he thought Leigh was capable of killing people.

1430
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:21,450
-由于病人保密法则...  -社工说他会杀人
-Because of patient confidentiality... -The man said yes.

1431
01:33:23,190 --> 01:33:25,365
你们为什么九个月没见过他? 
Why hadn't you seen him in nine months? 

1432
01:33:25,366 --> 01:33:27,250
 他在圣塔罗莎的学校上课
He's going to school in Santa Rosa.

1433
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:30,870
-圣塔罗莎?他住在哪里?  -他的拖车屋
-Santa Rosa? Where is he living? -In his trailer.

1434
01:33:31,030 --> 01:33:32,760
-在圣塔罗莎?  -索诺犸郡
-In Santa Rosa? -Sonoma County.

1435
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:35,130
我们不用透过瓦列霍检察官
We wouldn't have to go through the Vallejo DA.

1436
01:33:35,310 --> 01:33:38,330
你们有11个月没问过他话  现在要去搜他的拖车屋?
It's been 11 months since you talked to this guy, and now you wanna search his trailer?

1437
01:33:38,510 --> 01:33:40,170
能找到证物最好
If we find something, great.

1438
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:43,510
不然也能采到指纹和双手的笔迹
If not, we get his prints and handwriting samples from both hands.

1439
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:45,710
我以为莫瑞尔推翻了你的论点
I thought Sherwood shut you down.

1440
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:49,040
我想请别人鉴定
What if I can get a second opinion?

1441
01:33:50,450 --> 01:33:52,890
我不想反驳莫瑞尔的鉴定  我是他一手栽培的
I don't wanna step on Sherwood's toes. He trained me at this.

1442
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:55,790
我只想知道嫌犯能不能双手并用
Terry, all I need to know is if the suspect is ambidextrous.

1443
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:59,790
他是不是可能用另一只手写信
Could he possibly have written those letters with his other hand?

1444
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:02,220
我只告诉你
Between you and me?

1445
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:05,800
笔迹鉴定有不同的学派
Because there are differing schools of thought on this.

1446
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:11,340
只要拿到他另一只手的笔迹  如果他是黄道带就会符合
Get the samples of his other hand. If he's the Zodiac, you'll get a match.

1447
01:34:11,510 --> 01:34:14,310
这是泰瑞目前的想法
That's the current thinking, according to Terry Pascoe.

1448
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:17,240
我也问了愿意作证的心理医师
Meanwhile, I spoke to a psychologist who'd be willing to testify

1449
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:20,580
他说像黄道带这种性格多变的人
that someone who undergoes a personality change like Zodiac

1450
01:34:20,750 --> 01:34:23,580
生理上也会改变  比如改变笔迹
would manifest it physically, altering his handwriting.

1451
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:27,350
所以莫瑞尔的笔迹鉴定会不符合
Which is why Sherwood couldn't get a match from Allen's samples.

1452
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:29,690
泰瑞  心理医师和钱尼夫妇
We got Terry Pascoe, this psychology guy,

1453
01:34:29,860 --> 01:34:32,560
有他们就能申请搜索票
coupled with Cheney It could be enough for a warrant.

1454
01:34:32,730 --> 01:34:34,060
请钱尼做正式笔录
Get Cheney on the record.

1455
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:38,190
他就会自称为黄道带
And that he would call himself Zodiac.

1456
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:40,750
-是的  -你愿意在
-Yes. -And you're willing to swear to this,

1457
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:42,860
高等法庭发誓作证?
under oath, in Superior Court?

1458
01:34:43,030 --> 01:34:44,360
毫不会犹豫
Without any hesitation.

1459
01:34:44,530 --> 01:34:47,760
非常感谢你  钱尼先生
Thank you very much, Mr. Cheney. Thank you very much for your time.

1460
01:34:47,930 --> 01:34:48,550
谢谢你
Thank you.

1461
01:34:48,650 --> 01:34:50,040
嫌犯名叫亚瑟・李・艾伦
Suspect is Arthur Leigh Allen.

1462
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:53,870
家住加州圣塔罗莎日落拖车公园
Lives in Sunset Trailer Court in Santa Rosa, California.

1463
01:34:53,870 --> 01:34:55,540
体貌特征:
Physical description.

1464
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:57,870
艾伦高大  体型粗壮  
Allen is similar in height, weight and build

1465
01:34:57,870 --> 01:35:01,080
与贝湖行刺案所描述的案犯特征一致
to a man seen at Lake Berryessa on the day of the stabbings.

1466
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:03,960
但是  他和加州的那个案子体貌描述不一样
I understand he doesn't look much like the San Francisco composite.

1467
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:05,580
是的  高大粗壮只是粗略描述
True. Height and weight are sketchy,

1468
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:07,910
但是从都是粗壮的白种人这点看是一致的
but lumbering Caucasian with a crew cut is right on.

1469
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:10,280
我们对从孩子口中得到的口供并没有多少信心
We never had much confidence in the composite from the kids.

1470
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:12,410
那晚说是见到黄道带的巡警
The patrolman who say Zodiac that night

1471
01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:13,960
说他和草图上的并不相像
said he didn't look much like the sketch.

1472
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,540
军用靴鞋印
Military boot prints.

1473
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:18,370
艾伦入过海军  穿10号半的鞋
Allen was in the Navy. Wears a size 10-and-a-half.

1474
01:35:18,370 --> 01:35:20,910
与贝湖案的大小一致
Same size as the prints found at Berryessa.

1475
01:35:20,910 --> 01:35:22,700
那枪呢?
What about gun?

1476
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:27,370
切尼说他有好几种武器  我们会在搜捕令中写明
Cheney says Allen owns several firearms. We'll list them in the warrant.

1477
01:35:27,370 --> 01:35:30,240
-密码呢  -可能是在海军中学到的  
-And the ciphers. -Could be code training in the Navy,

1478
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:33,080
也有人作证说艾伦过去画过
and people have seen Allen with ciphers in the past.

1479
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:34,200
真的吗?  谁?
Really? Who?

1480
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:37,080
他的嫂子及他的哥哥叫做费尔・塔克
That would be his sister-in-law and a man named Phil Tucker

1481
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:39,490
他哥哥在瓦列霍的公共泳池工作
that he worked with at a public pool in Vallejo.

1482
01:35:39,490 --> 01:35:43,080
费尔・塔克还告诉我们他和弟弟曾
And Phil Tucker told us about a conversation that he had with Allen

1483
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:45,870
把手电装到枪管上
about how to attach a flashlight to the barrel of a gun.

1484
01:35:45,870 --> 01:35:49,200
从密码和手电上就给了我们2个证据
That gives us two sources on the ciphers and two on the flashlight.

1485
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:51,330
那他对孩子的恐吓呢?
What about his threats on children?

1486
01:35:51,330 --> 01:35:53,160
嫌犯曾在小学工作
Suspect worked for elementary schools

1487
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:56,490
因为猥亵于1968年3-4月间被开除
and was fired for molestation in March, April '68.

1488
01:35:56,490 --> 01:35:59,200
-这可能给他以动机  -至少  这是家庭因素
-Could give him motive. -At the very least, it's home turf.

1489
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:01,370
从他的恐吓信2个主要环节看  
He'd have knowledge of bus routes,

1490
01:36:01,370 --> 01:36:03,910
他对校车路线很熟悉
which the two major threats centered around.

1491
01:36:03,910 --> 01:36:05,660
炸弹呢?
What about the bomb?

1492
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:09,120
艾伦的工作是化学师
Allen works as a chemist.

1493
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:10,660
还对地理相当熟悉
Take him through the geography.

1494
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:12,240
瓦列霍谋杀犯
Vallejo murders.

1495
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:15,830
艾伦在瓦列霍曾和他妈妈  在她的地下室居住
Allen lives in Vallejo with his mother in her basement.

1496
01:36:15,830 --> 01:36:19,120
贝湖案  2个人被刺的那天
Berryessa murder. On the day that the two kids were stabbed

1497
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:21,870
他的邻居发现在他的车里有带血的匕首
his neighbor saw bloody knives in his truck

1498
01:36:21,870 --> 01:36:24,870
不过他的解释是用来杀鸡了
which he claimed were used to kill a chicken.

1499
01:36:24,870 --> 01:36:26,830
他辩解了?
Does he have any alibis?

1500
01:36:26,830 --> 01:36:29,580
是的  但是要不是他见过
He claimed he did, but he's been unable to produce the names

1501
01:36:29,580 --> 01:36:32,960
他不可能编造对  贝湖案那对情侣的名字
of the couple he supposedly met on the day of Berryessa.

1502
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:35,410
底线是艾伦不可能会辩解全部事
The bottom line is that Allen can't alibi up on anything.

1503
01:36:35,410 --> 01:36:37,330
滨河  瓦列霍  湖或者我们
Riverside, Vallejo, the lake or us.

1504
01:36:37,330 --> 01:36:39,620
-你要不要说说名字的事?  -什么名字?
-You want to tell me about the name? -What name?

1505
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:40,830
黄道带
Zodiac.

1506
01:36:40,830 --> 01:36:44,830
艾伦戴的手表不但有那个单词  还有那个十字图案
Allen wears a watch that bears both the word and crosshair symbol.

1507
01:36:44,830 --> 01:36:46,280
他还向切尼提起过
And he mentioned Zodiac to Cheney

1508
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:48,870
事情发生一年半之前在任何信件中都可以看到
a year and a half before it appeared in any letter.

1509
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:54,580
-约翰  -非常好  伙计们
-John... -That's pretty good, guys.

1510
01:36:54,580 --> 01:36:57,580
-我们也是这么想的  -让我们把他绳之以法吧
-We think so, too. -Let's take it to a judge.

1511
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:05,170
(1972年9月14日  加州  圣塔罗莎  日落拖车公园A-7号)

1512
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:19,090
艾伦先生?
Mr. Allen?

1513
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:23,590
圣塔罗莎警局  我们有搜索票
This is the Santa Rosa Police Department. We have a warrant to search your residence.

1514
01:37:34,970 --> 01:37:36,300
有人吗?
Hello?

1515
01:37:44,950 --> 01:37:46,850
我去问附近的邻居
I'll check with the neighbors.

1516
01:37:48,490 --> 01:37:49,980
-关门  -关门
-Close the door. -Close the door,

1517
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:52,210
有鼠类动物跑来跑去
there's rodents running around.

1518
01:38:04,870 --> 01:38:07,390
邻居说他半小时前闪人了
Neighbor said he tore out of here about a half-hour ago.

主要是我的啦
Mostly mine.

1649
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:06,890
有什么新鲜事?
So, what's new?

1650
01:48:08,890 --> 01:48:11,920
我在想  应该有人写本书
I've been thinking. Yeah. Somebody should write a book.

1651
01:48:12,100 --> 01:48:15,230
早就该有人写本书
Somebody should write a fucking book, that's for sure.

1652
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:17,960
-写什么?  -黄道带的案子
-About what? -About Zodiac.

1653
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:20,390
这不是什么新鲜事
It's not new.

1654
01:48:20,570 --> 01:48:24,470
我在想只要把所有线索兜在一块
I've been thinking that if you put all the information together,

1655
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:27,640
也许会有什么新发现
maybe you could jog something loose.

1656
01:48:27,810 --> 01:48:30,750
-没有人比你更了解整件案子  -那倒是真的
-And then I was thinking that nobody knows the case better than you. -Yeah. That's true.

1657
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:33,750
你有档案  认识每个人
You know all the players, and you have all the files.

1658
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:36,650
-档案没了  -你弄丢了?
-Lost them. -You lost them?

1659
01:48:36,820 --> 01:48:40,280
还是扔了  我不知道  我人都搬到船上了
Or I tossed them. I don't know. I moved onto a boat.

1660
01:48:40,460 --> 01:48:43,520
你应该知道我们是跑每日新闻
You know that we work in the daily business, right?

1661
01:48:43,700 --> 01:48:45,990
干嘛管那老掉牙的新闻?
As in, today. What do you think we were doing back then?

1662
01:48:47,700 --> 01:48:50,570
东湾每三个月死于车祸的人
Do you know that more people die in the East Bay commute

1663
01:48:50,740 --> 01:48:52,200
都比那疯子
every three months than that idiot ever killed?

1664
01:48:52,370 --> 01:48:56,670
他杀了几个人  写了几封信  然后就这样消失了
He offed a few citizens, he wrote a few letters, and he faded into a footnote.

1665
01:49:02,610 --> 01:49:06,910
我又没笨到坐在这里等你来
Not that I haven't been sitting here idly waiting for you to drop by

1666
01:49:07,090 --> 01:49:09,920
让我重拾人生意义
and reinvigorate my sense of purpose.

1667
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:14,520
那是四年前的事  忘了吧
It was four years ago. Let it fucking go.

1668
01:49:14,860 --> 01:49:17,990
你错了  这件事很重要
You're wrong. It was important.

1669
01:49:19,160 --> 01:49:21,360
那你到底做了什么?
Then, what did you ever do about it?

1670
01:49:22,430 --> 01:49:24,770
真的那么重要  你却啥都没做
If it was so fucking important, what did you ever do?

1671
01:49:24,940 --> 01:49:27,460
你搜我的桌子  翻我的垃圾
You hovered over my desk, you stole from wastebaskets.

1672
01:49:27,640 --> 01:49:29,300
我有对你翻脸吗?
Am I being unkind?

1673
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:34,670
我忘了  你都去图书馆
Oh, that's right, I forgot. You went to the library.

1674
01:49:36,580 --> 01:49:38,640
抱歉打扰你
I'm sorry I bothered you.

1675
01:50:02,770 --> 01:50:05,800
-你去了哪里?  -图书馆
-Where you been? -The library.

1676
01:50:14,690 --> 01:50:19,680
(1977年10月11日  加州旧金山 华盛顿与樱桃街转角处)

1677
01:50:36,910 --> 01:50:38,570
谢谢你
Thank you!

1678
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:57,690
-陶希警探?  -请等一下
-Inspector Toschi? -Yeah? One moment, please.

1679
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:06,170
我们在戏院见过面
We met at the movies once.

1680
01:51:06,770 --> 01:51:09,140
-那一定是在变魔术  -我是罗伯・葛雷史密斯
-It must have been magical. -I'm Robert Graysmith. I work at the Chronicle.

1681
01:51:09,310 --> 01:51:12,640
在<旧金山纪事报>工作  能请你吃顿午餐吗?
I was wondering if I could buy you lunch.

1682
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:15,740
好啊  有何不可?
Sure, why not?

1683
01:51:15,910 --> 01:51:18,820
你是保罗・艾瑞的朋友?
So, you're a friend of Paul Avery's?

1684
01:51:18,980 --> 01:51:21,280
我是为了他来找你的
He's actually the reason I'm here.

1685
01:51:22,890 --> 01:51:24,790
我想请教黄道带的案子
I wanted to ask you about Zodiac.

1686
01:51:25,660 --> 01:51:28,680
多谢了  不过我们不准讨论案情
Well, I appreciate the interest, but we don't discuss open cases.

1687
01:51:28,860 --> 01:51:31,160
那警方每天都在做什么?
Oh, well, what's going on with it, day to day?

1688
01:51:31,330 --> 01:51:33,630
积极调查任何线索
We're actively pursuing all leads.

1689
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:36,770
案子就剩你一个人在办
And you're the only one on it, right?

1690
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:38,930
葛雷史密斯先生
Mr. Graysmith,

1691
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:41,500
黄道带有三年没有写过信
Zodiac hasn't written in three years.

1692
01:51:41,670 --> 01:51:44,470
你知道之后旧金山发生几起命案?
You know how many murders we've had in San Francisco since then?

1693
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:46,130
-不知道  -200起以上
-No. -Over 200.

1694
01:51:46,310 --> 01:51:49,340
有很多死者和家属需要帮助
That's a lot of dead people and grieving families that need our help.

1695
01:51:49,510 --> 01:51:51,040
所以已经没有人在乎了
So, nobody cares.

1696
01:51:51,220 --> 01:51:54,150
不好意思  我很在乎
Excuse me? I care.

1697
01:51:56,490 --> 01:51:58,720
我可以给你看样东西吗?
Okay. Can I show you something?

1698
01:52:01,660 --> 01:52:04,790
我针对第一张密码做了研究
I've been doing research on the first cipher.

1699
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:09,900
对解码有兴趣的业余人士  都能在这些书里找到解答
Everything an amateur would need to create it can be found in these books.

1700
01:52:10,070 --> 01:52:13,270
我在想如果追踪这些书的去向
Now, I started thinking that if you can track these books,

1701
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:15,370
也许就能找到凶手
then maybe you can track the man.

1702
01:52:16,270 --> 01:52:19,000
你说过黄道带有可能是军人
So, I remember you thought that Zodiac was military,

1703
01:52:19,180 --> 01:52:22,740
我跑遍所有的军事基地图书馆
so I went to every base library and I got a list of every person

1704
01:52:22,910 --> 01:52:26,910
列出借过这些书的人的名字  最后发现一件事
who's ever checked out these books and that's when I found this.

1705
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:34,250
-遗失  -表示这些书是被偷走
-Missing. -It means they were stolen.

1706
01:52:34,860 --> 01:52:38,560
普西迪图书馆的密码书都被偷走
So, almost every book on ciphers was stolen from the Presidio Library?

1707
01:52:38,730 --> 01:52:40,820
还有奥克兰陆军图书馆
And the Oakland Army Terminal Library.

1708
01:52:44,140 --> 01:52:47,870
有人不想被查到他借了这些书
Somebody didn't want a record of ever having checked out these books.

1709
01:52:48,710 --> 01:52:50,730
你是谁?
Who are you again?

1710
01:52:52,440 --> 01:52:54,500
我只想帮忙
I just wanna help.

1711
01:52:57,280 --> 01:52:59,310
我不能让你帮忙
I can't allow you to help.

1712
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:02,580
不能和你讨论案情  提供资料
I can't discuss the case with you. I can't give you information,

1713
01:53:02,750 --> 01:53:06,520
更不能叫你去那帕找肯恩纳尔罗
and I certainly couldn't tell you to go see Ken Narlow in Napa.

1714
01:53:06,690 --> 01:53:08,020
纳K尔K罗
N-A-R-L-O-W.

1715
01:53:23,110 --> 01:53:25,240
我不是作家  是漫画家
Well, I'm not a writer, I'm a cartoonist.

1716
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:28,810
-大卫・陶希叫你来  -对
-And Dave Toschi sent you? -Yes.

1717
01:53:28,980 --> 01:53:30,710
为什么?
Why?

1718
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:33,040
也许他认为我帮得上忙
Maybe he...maybe he thought that I could do some good.

1719
01:53:34,450 --> 01:53:39,220
-你是童子军吗?  -第一级鹰级童子军
-What are you, some kind of boy scout? -Eagle Scout, actually, first class.

1720
01:53:39,660 --> 01:53:42,630
你想查就尽管查
Well, if you wanna do this, don't let me stop you.

1721
01:53:43,930 --> 01:53:46,290
先去找瓦列霍的杰克・穆拉斯
Better start with Vallejo, Jack Mulanax.

1722
01:53:47,070 --> 01:53:49,260
我知道你想干嘛
I understand what you're trying to do.

1723
01:53:49,430 --> 01:53:51,660
但这是警方的公开调查
But this is an open police investigation.

1724
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:54,000
我是大卫陶希的朋友
I'm a friend of Dave Toschi's.

1725
01:53:54,170 --> 01:53:57,200
他说你能帮助我
And he said that you might be able to help.

1726
01:53:57,710 --> 01:54:01,270
案子没进展  凶手早就走人了
I mean, the case is dead. Zodiac's long gone.

1727
01:54:01,450 --> 01:54:03,680
他不是新闻了  对吗?
He's yesterday's news, right?

1728
01:54:04,620 --> 01:54:06,410
他们是这么说的
That's what they say.

1729
01:54:07,220 --> 01:54:09,150
所以你有什么损失呢?
So, what's the harm?

1730
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:10,840
不准带纸笔
No pens, no paper.

1731
01:54:11,020 --> 01:54:13,860
想知道的就记在脑子里
Anything that you see that's relevant, you got to remember in your head.

1732
01:54:14,030 --> 01:54:15,360
了解
Okay.

1733
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:19,360
-好  来吧  -哪一个?
-Okay, here we go. -Which one?

1734
01:54:19,530 --> 01:54:23,370
全部都是  隔壁有更多  全部都有编号
All of them. And there's more in the next room. They're all marked with these numbers.

1735
01:54:23,540 --> 01:54:26,630
-243-146  -你不抽烟吧?
-243-146. -You don't smoke, do you?

1736
01:54:26,940 --> 01:54:29,960
高中抽过一次
Once. In high school.

1737
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:33,970
这是什么?
What's this?

1738
01:54:34,780 --> 01:54:36,680
谢啦
Thank you.

1739
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:38,440

Darlene's sister, Linda. It was all just deep breathing. George.

1749

那是个怪人  怪人
It was a strange man. George. Strange man.

1750

-Who's that? -That's Graysmith.

Some cartoonist. Thinks he's gonna solve the Zodiac.

1755
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:02,290
很好呀
Well, good for him.

1756

-Thank you for meeting me, Inspector. -No. We're not meeting, Robert.

1762
01:56:35,300 --> 01:56:37,600
我们只是碰巧一起坐在这里
We're just two guys who happen to be sitting on the same bench at the same time.

1763

你只有五分钟  我还得回总部
I've got five minutes. I've got to get back to the Hall.

1764
01:56:40,540 --> 01:56:43,670
就你所知  你在进行调查时
Okay. As far as you know, did anyone ever get in touch

1765
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:46,500
有人找过麦克梅休  让他看嫌犯的照片吗?
with Mike Mageau during your investigation and show him suspect photos?

1766
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:47,670
为什么?
Why?

1767
01:56:47,850 --> 01:56:50,780
他是唯一看过黄道带的生还者
Well, he's the only surviving victim who ever saw Zodiac without a mask.

1768
01:56:50,950 --> 01:56:53,380
你为什么要问我?  梅休和黛琳案隶属瓦列霍管辖
No, I mean, why are you asking me? Mageau and Darlene, that's Vallejo's case.

1769
01:56:53,550 --> 01:56:55,990
我只调查保罗・史坦  剩四分钟
Paul Stine is mine. You've got four minutes now.

1770
01:56:56,150 --> 01:56:58,620
黛琳・费伦曾被跟踪
Darlene Ferrin was being followed.

1771
01:56:58,790 --> 01:57:01,220
我知道穆拉斯锁定一名嫌犯  乔治・瓦特
Now, I know Mulanax says that they already found this guy, a George Waters?

1772
01:57:01,390 --> 01:57:05,060
黛琳在餐馆也有很多仰慕者
But he also said that she had a lot of admirers who would come to the restaurant where she worked.

1773
01:57:05,230 --> 01:57:06,890
-她很有人缘  -的确是
-She was popular. -Very.

1774
01:57:07,070 --> 01:57:10,060
后来她和老公搬到新家
Yeah. So...She and her husband, they move into their new house,

1775
01:57:10,230 --> 01:57:12,430
有天晚上他们办了油漆派对

1776
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:15,630
-什么是油漆派对?  -一堆朋友来帮忙油漆的派对
-And what's a painting party? -It's a party where people come and help you paint.

1777
01:57:15,810 --> 01:57:18,330
-听起来很烂  -假设
-Sounds like a terrible party. -Well, supposedly,

1778
01:57:18,510 --> 01:57:20,700
来的人并不是瓦特
somebody who's not Waters shows up.

1779
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:22,540
而且黛琳很怕他
And Darlene is terrified of him.

1780
01:57:22,710 --> 01:57:24,650
你认为黛琳认识黄道带
So you think that Darlene knew Zodiac?

1781
01:57:24,820 --> 01:57:28,980
他认识黛琳  或许梅休也认识他
And if Zodiac knew Darlene, then maybe Mageau knows Zodiac.

1782
01:57:29,150 --> 01:57:30,850
有可能  但是梅休落跑了
Maybe. But Mageau's gone.

1783
01:57:31,020 --> 01:57:34,390
你想靠黛琳找到黄道带  就要用别的方法
So if you wanna connect Darlene to Zodiac, you're gonna have to find another way.

1784
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:37,460
我有别的方法  黛琳被谋杀当晚的通联纪录
I have another way. Phone calls the night of Darlene's murder.

1785
01:57:37,630 --> 01:57:40,760
-黄道带有打给警方  -不  大卫  当晚还有四通电话
-Yeah, Zodiac called the police. -No, Dave, there were four other calls.

1786
01:57:40,930 --> 01:57:41,966
两通打到黛琳家 
There were two to Darlene's house,

1787
01:57:41,967 --> 01:57:44,300
 一通打给黛琳小叔  一通打给她公公
one to Darlene's brotherinlaw,and one to Darlene's fatherinlaw.

1788
01:57:44,470 --> 01:57:47,400
只有沉重的呼吸声  电话从半夜一点半开始打
Just heavy breathing. They started around 1:30 a.m. ,

1789
01:57:47,570 --> 01:57:51,130
当时黛琳家人不知道她已遇害
and this was before anyone in the family knew that Darlene had been shot.

1790
01:57:51,310 --> 01:57:53,370
-这全在瓦列霍的档案  -是的
-This was in the Vallejo files? -Yeah.

1791
01:57:53,540 --> 01:57:55,670
-可恶  -这并非完全是巧合吧?
-God damn it. -It's got to be more than just a coincidence, right?

1792
01:57:55,850 --> 01:57:59,510
黛琳被害的九十分钟后  全家人都接到
I mean, somebody doesn't just randomly prank phone call a victim's entire family

1793
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:01,520
同一通恶作剧电话
90 minutes after they were shot.

1794
01:58:01,690 --> 01:58:05,210
所以黄道带不是随机杀死那对情侣  然后才认出黛琳
So, either Zodiac shoots a random couple, then he recognizes Darlene...

1795
01:58:05,390 --> 01:58:07,320
就是他故意杀死黛琳的
Or Darlene was shot on purpose.

1796
01:58:07,490 --> 01:58:11,220
无论如何  黄道带一定认识黛琳
Either way, Zodiac had to have known Darlene.

1797
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:14,760
非常好  罗伯
That's good, Robert.

1798
01:58:14,930 --> 01:58:17,660
既然找不到梅休  或许我可以找黛琳的姐姐
So, I can't find Mageau, so maybe I can find Darlene's sister.

1799
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:20,030
也许她知道神秘男子是谁
And maybe she can tell me who this mystery man is.

1800
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:23,370
试试看  我得走了  她很可爱
Try that. I've got to go. She's very cute.

1801
01:58:26,810 --> 01:58:31,110
很有趣  你提到黄道带打到被害者家里
You know, it's interesting that you should mention Zodiac calling people at home.

1802
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:34,270
-他在旧金山也干过一次  -什么?  他打给谁?
-He did that in San Francisco once. -What? Who did he call?

1803
01:58:34,450 --> 01:58:37,980
不能说  这是机密
I can't tell you. That's privileged information.

1804
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:41,020
也许梅尔文・贝利能告诉你
But maybe Melvin Belli could.

1805
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:48,090
梅尔文・贝利  该怎么联络他?
Melvin Belli. How do I get to Melvin Belli?

1806
01:58:48,700 --> 01:58:51,190
-他马上就会回家了  -没关系
-He should be along soon. -Oh, that's all right.

1807
01:58:51,370 --> 01:58:55,740
-我才等了两个小时  -他通常不会这么晚回家
-I've really... I've only been waiting two hours, so... -He's usually not this late.

1808
01:58:55,910 --> 01:58:59,140
饼干  谢谢  看起来很好吃
Oh, cookies. Thank you. These look great.

1809
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:01,210
你是来谈公事吗?
You are here on business?

1810
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:03,400
我在写一本关于黄道带的书
I'm writing a book about the Zodiac.

1811
01:59:03,580 --> 01:59:06,140
我记得他  我跟他谈过
I remember that. I spoke to him.

1812
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:10,980
-你跟贝利先生谈过黄道带案?  -不是  黄道带打过电话来
-You mean to Mr. Belli about the case? -No, to the Zodiac when he called.

1813
01:59:11,160 --> 01:59:14,220
他说那天是他的生日  非得杀人不可
He said he had to kill because it was his birthday.

1814
01:59:14,390 --> 01:59:17,450
等一下  他说那天是他生日?
He said it... Wait. He said it was his birthday?

1815
01:59:17,630 --> 01:59:20,500
对  你要喝什么吗?
Yes. You want something to drink?

1816
01:59:21,870 --> 01:59:23,560
那是什么时候的事?
When was this?

1817
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:26,530
好几年前
Oh, so many years ago.

1818
01:59:27,070 --> 01:59:31,170
贝利先生圣诞节去渡假一星期
Mr. Belli was away for Christmas. Gone for a week.

1819
01:59:31,340 --> 01:59:33,810
黄道带打来要找贝利先生
The Zodiac called, wanting to talk to him.

1820
01:59:33,980 --> 01:59:35,310
我说他人不在家
I said, He is not here.

1821
01:59:35,480 --> 01:59:38,070
他说今天我生日  我要杀人
He said, I have to kill. Today is my birthday.

1822
01:59:38,250 --> 01:59:40,270
然后就挂了电话
And then he hangs up.

1823
01:59:40,450 --> 01:59:42,010
之后信件就寄来了
Then the letter arrived.

1824
01:59:42,190 --> 01:59:46,320
电话是12月20日  信寄来之前打的?
So, the call came before the letter of December 20th.

1825
01:59:46,490 --> 01:59:48,290
贝利先生去渡假一个星期?
Mr. Belli was gone for a week?

1826
01:59:48,460 --> 01:59:52,120
圣诞节当天才回来  那天不适合工作
He came back on Christmas. Not a good day to work.

1827
01:59:52,300 --> 01:59:53,920
那他就是18号离开的
So, he left on the 18th.

1828
01:59:55,400 --> 01:59:58,270
-我有帮到忙吗?  -她说那天是他的生日
-Is that helpful? -She said it was his birthday.

1829
01:59:58,440 --> 02:00:01,030
现在你就得去证实了
Well, you'd have to confirm that, now wouldn't you?

1830
02:00:01,210 --> 02:00:03,670
我该怎么做?
How?

1831
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:06,780
我没有问过她话  也许我搭档有
Well, I never spoke to her, but maybe my partner did.

1832
02:00:06,940 --> 02:00:09,940
-我要怎么联络你搭档?  -没办法  他不想再扯进来
-How do I get a hold of him? -You don't. Bill wanted out of this.

1833
02:00:10,110 --> 02:00:12,210
我也觉得他应该抽身
As far as I'm concerned, he should stay out.

1834
02:00:12,380 --> 02:00:13,510
那我该如何确认?
How do I confirm it?

1835
02:00:13,680 --> 02:00:16,310
假如我搭档跟司法部提过此事
Well, if my partner did talk to someone from Justice,

1836
02:00:16,490 --> 02:00:19,980
他们应该有报告  这是正常程序
then they would've had to put that in a report. That's standard procedure.

1837
02:00:20,460 --> 02:00:22,430
-好吧  -是倪梅尔
-Okay. -Mel Nicolai.

1838
02:00:22,590 --> 02:00:24,820
-谢谢  -再见
-Thank you. -Goodbye.

1839
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,290
-我只要确认一个日期  -葛先生
-I just need to confirm a date. -Mr. Graysmith

1840
02:00:27,470 --> 02:00:30,490
日期是在12月18到20日之间
I've narrowed it down between the 18th and the 20th of December, and I just need...

1841
02:00:30,670 --> 02:00:34,000
好吧  我参一脚  假设真的有这通电话
Okay, I'll play. Let's say this phone call did take place.

1842
02:00:34,170 --> 02:00:38,270
而且是黄道带本人打的  他为什么愿意说出自己的生日?
Let's say it really was Zodiac. Why would he volunteer the day he was born?

1843
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:40,270
而且12月18日没有人遇害
Plus, nobody died on December 18th,

1844
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:43,900
就像他扬言要在周末  杀死一打人一样
just like nobody died over the weekend when he was gonna kill a dozen people,

1845
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:46,070
炸毁校车或射杀学童也没发生
or when he was gonna shoot school kids or blow up buses.

1846
02:00:46,250 --> 02:00:49,120
-葛先生  他是个骗子  -也许他犯了错
-He's a liar, Mr. Graysmith. -What if he made a mistake?

1847
02:00:49,420 --> 02:00:51,720
如果他没说谎  电话也是他打的
What if he wasn't lying? What if it was him on the phone?

1848
02:00:51,720 --> 02:00:53,720
只是没料到接电话的是个好人
He didn't expect to pick it up, a nice person to pick up.

1849
02:00:53,890 --> 02:00:55,150
这么多也许?
What if? What if? What if?

1850
02:00:55,330 --> 02:00:58,660
老实说  比尔查过这条线索
Look, off the record, Bill Armstrong checked this out.

1851
02:00:58,830 --> 02:01:01,300
我们很重视这条线索
We took this very seriously.

1852
02:01:01,470 --> 02:01:04,560
没有一个嫌犯的生日符合
None of the suspects had the same birthday as this phantom caller.

1853
02:01:04,740 --> 02:01:07,070
比尔・阿姆斯壮
Bill Armstrong.

1854
02:01:12,410 --> 02:01:16,510
我给你一个建议  你的搜查方向错了
Can I give you a piece of advice? You're looking in the wrong place.

1855
02:01:16,680 --> 02:01:19,550
笔迹和指纹才是确切的证据
Handwriting, fingerprints, that's what this whole thing's about.

1856
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:20,950
去找这些证据
Stick to the evidence.

1857
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:33,590
今天还好吗?
Hey. How was your day?

1858
02:01:33,760 --> 02:01:35,290
很累
Long.

1859
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:41,030
莫瑞尔是谁?
Who's Sherwood Morrill?

1860
02:01:41,210 --> 02:01:43,870
他是位出色的笔迹鉴定专家
He's a handwriting expert in Sacramento.

1861
02:01:44,040 --> 02:01:47,410
他打来说明天早上七点能见你
He called. He said he can meet you tomorrow morning at 7:00.

1862
02:01:47,580 --> 02:01:48,910
太好了
Oh, great.

1863
02:01:49,080 --> 02:01:50,340
你早上会请假?
So you're taking off work?

1864
02:01:50,510 --> 02:01:52,610
一个小时吧
Just an hour.

1865
02:01:53,450 --> 02:01:54,780
到沙加缅度要两个小时
Sacramento's two hours away.

1866
02:01:56,890 --> 02:01:59,050
-真的吗?  -真的
-Really?  -Yes.

1867
02:01:59,220 --> 02:02:00,710
这是什么?
What's this?

1868
02:02:00,890 --> 02:02:03,330
这是K一篇文章
Oh, that's that article.

1869
02:02:03,490 --> 02:02:06,930
罗伯葛雷和出版社  洽谈黄道带一书
Robert Graysmith has quietly been shopping his book about the Zodiac.

1870
02:02:07,100 --> 02:02:08,260
是啊
Yeah.

1871
02:02:08,430 --> 02:02:12,630
-文章都是你搜集黄道带的资料  -这就是这篇文章的题材
-It talks all about you researching Zodiac. -Well, that's what the article's about.

1872
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:14,790
这种事我并不想让人知道
I'm not so sure that's something we want people to know about.

1873
02:02:14,970 --> 02:02:16,130
怎么  你觉得很丢脸?
Why? Are you embarrassed?

1874
02:02:16,310 --> 02:02:19,170
罗伯  我们都知道黄道带会做什么?
Robert, what's the one thing we know about Zodiac?

1875
02:02:20,280 --> 02:02:21,800
他会看<旧金山纪事报>
He reads the Chronicle.

1876
02:02:21,980 --> 02:02:24,780
但是他从来不看贺伯・肯恩的专栏
Yeah, but he's never gonna read Herb Caen.

1877
02:02:28,690 --> 02:02:30,880
-喂?  -葛先生?
-Hello. -Mr. Graysmith?

1878
02:02:31,060 --> 02:02:33,550
你是今天文章里提到的罗伯?
The Robert Graysmith mentioned in the paper today?

1879
02:02:33,720 --> 02:02:34,880
对
Yeah?

1880
02:02:35,060 --> 02:02:37,890
我能告诉你谁是黄道带
I can tell you who the Zodiac is.

1881
02:02:40,730 --> 02:02:43,830
-你是谁?  -黄道带对电影很着迷
-Who is this? -The Zodiac Killer is obsessed with movies.

1882
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,600
他会拍下他的犯案过程
He recorded his murders on film.

1883
02:02:46,770 --> 02:02:49,930
我告诉警方  他们不想调查
I tried to tell the police, but they wouldn't follow through on it.

1884
02:02:50,110 --> 02:02:53,510
你要找一个叫鲍伯・冯恩的人
There's a man you need to find. His name is Bob Vaughn.

1885
02:02:53,680 --> 02:02:55,980
-笔!  -冯恩
-Pen, pen. -V-A-U-G-H-N.

1886
02:02:56,150 --> 02:02:57,980
他是黄道带的朋友
He's a friend of the Zodiac's.

1887
02:02:58,150 --> 02:03:00,480
冯先生不知道他朋友是凶手
Mr. Vaughn does not know his friend is a killer,

1888
02:03:00,650 --> 02:03:02,980
他替他保存影片胶卷盒
and he is storing some film canisters for him.

1889
02:03:03,150 --> 02:03:05,050
那些影片就是证据
In these canisters is the evidence.

1890
02:03:05,220 --> 02:03:08,390
朋友?  这位朋友是谁?
Okay, yeah, friend? Who is this friend?

1891
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:11,760
-你有这些资料应该就够了  -拜托
-You have quite enough to get started. -Oh, please.

1892
02:03:11,930 --> 02:03:16,230
黄道带的名字是瑞克马修
The Zodiac's name is Rick Marshall.

1893
02:03:18,940 --> 02:03:21,130
你的吐司烤焦了
Your toast is burning.

1894
02:03:22,110 --> 02:03:27,640
我们在成长的阶段  会习惯每个字母的写法
We choose at some point in our lives how to physically construct each letter.

1895
02:03:27,810 --> 02:03:29,910
我们的脑海会牢记这些写法
Once we lock that into our brains,

1896
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:32,450
笔迹可能会随着岁月改变
our handwriting may change over the years,

1897
02:03:32,620 --> 02:03:35,980
但是写字的方法不会变  你懂吗?
But the moves themselves remain unaltered. Understand?

1898
02:03:36,150 --> 02:03:37,620
我懂
Yes.

1899
02:03:38,320 --> 02:03:40,880
但是黄道带的写法会变
Except Zodiac's doesn't.

1900
02:03:42,090 --> 02:03:44,460
尤其是K这个字母
Specifically with his K.

1901
02:03:45,130 --> 02:03:47,860
他第一封信的K用了两笔划
In his first letters, he executed the K with two strokes.

1902
02:03:48,030 --> 02:03:50,830
-之后的信却变成三笔划  -为什么?
-Later letters, he did them with three. -Why?

1903
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,870
我们不知道  抱歉  我得浇花
We don't know. Excuse me, I've got to spray this.

1904
02:03:54,040 --> 02:03:57,100
几个人因为笔迹被排除嫌疑?
How many suspects were cleared through handwriting?

1905
02:03:57,270 --> 02:04:02,180
全部  还有计程车上的指纹  全都不符合任何人
All of them. Also the print in the cab. No match was ever found.

1906
02:04:02,350 --> 02:04:06,370
有人能够骗过笔迹检验比对吗?
Is there any way that someone could beat a handwriting test?

1907
02:04:06,550 --> 02:04:11,280
没有  不管黄道带是谁  绝对不是我排除嫌疑的那些人
No. Whoever the Zodiac is, he's not someone I cleared.

1908
02:04:11,890 --> 02:04:15,350
一个月前有个男人找到我家  他看来很烦恼
About a month ago, a man showed up on my doorstep very distraught.

1909
02:04:15,630 --> 02:04:18,120
他叫瓦勒斯佩尼
His name was Wallace Penny.

1910
02:04:18,300 --> 02:04:22,660
他说他认识黄道带  还给了名字
He said he knew who the Zodiac was. Gave me a name.

1911
02:04:22,830 --> 02:04:25,530
-瑞克  瑞克什么的  -瑞克・马修?
-Rick. Rick somebody. -Rick Marshall?

1912
02:04:26,970 --> 02:04:30,000
是啊  同一个人也打了电话给我
Yeah. I think that the man who you talked to called me, too.

1913
02:04:30,170 --> 02:04:34,770
他一走我就查我的档案  我没排除瑞克・马修的嫌疑
After he left, then I checked my files. I never cleared a Rick Marshall.

1914
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:43,410
喂?
Hello?

1915
02:04:48,190 --> 02:04:50,020
你是谁?
Hello? Who is this?

1916
02:04:59,900 --> 02:05:01,700
打错了
It's the wrong number.

1917
02:05:08,080 --> 02:05:11,070
你听过瑞克・马修这名字吗?
Does the name Rick Marshall mean anything to you?

1918
02:05:12,080 --> 02:05:15,280
-你想找什么?  -你有什么?
-What are you after? -What do you got?

1919
02:05:15,450 --> 02:05:20,290
其实你说出了我最爱的嫌犯名字
Hypothetically, you just named my favorite suspect in the whole case.

1920
02:05:20,830 --> 02:05:24,660
这些话不能公开  几年前我想采马修的指纹
This is off the record. Couple years back, I was trying to get Marshall's prints.

1921
02:05:24,830 --> 02:05:27,060
我给他一张照片
I handed him a photo.

1922
02:05:27,230 --> 02:05:29,060
他看了一下  还给我的时候说
He looks at it. He's about to give it back and he stops and he says,

1923
02:05:29,230 --> 02:05:31,630
天啊  上面都是我的指纹
My goodness, I got fingerprints all over this.

1924
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:34,130
然后就把指纹擦掉
And he wipes them off.

1925
02:05:34,310 --> 02:05:36,170
你为什么没有比对他的笔迹?
Why didn't you test him for handwriting?

1926
02:05:36,340 --> 02:05:38,600
因为后来采到他的指纹
Because when they finally did run his prints,

1927
02:05:38,780 --> 02:05:41,180
不符合计程车上那枚指纹
they cleared him against the one in Stine's cab.

1928
02:05:41,350 --> 02:05:43,250
-凶手就不是他  -也许是  也许不是
-So, then, it's not him. -Maybe yes, maybe no.

1929
02:05:43,410 --> 02:05:45,440
什么意思?
No. What do you mean?

1930
02:05:45,620 --> 02:05:47,680
黄道带在现场留下一对手套
Zodiac left gloves behind at the scene.

1931
02:05:47,850 --> 02:05:49,840
如果他知道要戴手套犯案
If he had the foresight to bring gloves with him

1932
02:05:50,020 --> 02:05:52,510
怎么会不小心留下指纹?
how the hell's he gonna accidentally leave a print behind?

1933
02:05:52,690 --> 02:05:54,280
指纹印在死者的血迹上面
But it was in the victim's blood.

1934
02:05:54,460 --> 02:05:58,450
也许是旁观者的指纹  或是刑警不小心留下的指纹
Could have been one of the bystanders, or a cop just reaches out, boom, false print.

1935
02:05:58,630 --> 02:06:00,720
这枚指纹排除了2500名嫌犯
Yeah, but that print disqualified 2,500 suspects.

1936
02:06:00,900 --> 02:06:03,660
-所以才同时比对笔迹  -除了瑞克马修
-Which is why we also used handwriting. -But not for Rick Marshall.

1937
02:06:03,830 --> 02:06:06,670
旧金山刑警在他家窗户看到字迹
SFPD saw a handwritten sign in the window of his house.

1938
02:06:06,840 --> 02:06:09,970
觉得不像黄道带的笔迹  于是就不去管他了
Decided it looked nothing like the Z letters, so they just moved on.

1939
02:06:10,140 --> 02:06:12,630
他们怎么知道那是瑞克的字迹
How do they know that Rick Marshall wrote the sign?

1940
02:06:12,810 --> 02:06:15,040
我也这么想
My thoughts exactly.

1941
02:06:15,210 --> 02:06:17,310
瑞克马修是个海军
Rick Marshall was a Navy man.

1942
02:06:17,480 --> 02:06:21,420
接受过编码训练  他也在一家电影院当放映师
He received code training. He was also a projectionist at a silent film theater.

1943
02:06:21,590 --> 02:06:23,750
那我该怎么拿到瑞克的笔迹?
Well, then, how do I get copies of Rick Marshall's handwriting?

1944
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:27,520
三种方法  一: 申请搜索票  你拿不到
Three ways. One, get a warrant, which you can't.

1945
02:06:27,690 --> 02:06:30,490
第二是他自愿提供  不可能  第三种方法呢?
Two, get him to volunteer, which he won't. Yeah, and three?

1946
02:06:31,930 --> 02:06:33,690
你自己想办法
Get creative.

1947
02:06:33,860 --> 02:06:36,590
我没有好建议  你拿到我就比对
I don't know what to tell you. You get it, I'll analyze it.

1948
02:06:36,770 --> 02:06:40,360
-其它的就要靠你自己  -那个去找你的人
-Beyond that, you're on your own. -Okay, what about the guy who came to see you,

1949
02:06:40,540 --> 02:06:41,870
也是打给我的那个人呢?
the one who called me?

1950
02:06:42,040 --> 02:06:44,530
你是说瓦勒斯・佩尼?
You mean Wallace Penny?

1951
02:06:44,710 --> 02:06:47,040
他有留下电话号码吗?
Yeah. Did he leave a number?

1952
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:59,290
-喂?  -嗨  我是罗伯・葛雷史密斯
-Hello? -Hi, this is Robert Graysmith.

1953
02:06:59,460 --> 02:07:02,550
-你怎么找到我?  -我需要瑞克・马修的笔迹样本
-How did you find me? -I need a sample of Rick Marshall's handwriting.

1954
02:07:02,730 --> 02:07:04,060
我说过  冯恩K
I told you. Vaughn is who...

1955
02:07:04,230 --> 02:07:06,890
佩尼先生  如果瑞克是黄道带
Mr. Penny, if Rick Marshall is the Zodiac,

1956
02:07:07,060 --> 02:07:09,560
我就需要他的笔迹当证据
I need a sample of his handwriting to confirm it.

1957
02:07:09,730 --> 02:07:11,860
你到底能不能帮忙?
Can you help me or not?

1958
02:07:13,070 --> 02:07:17,560
瑞克替冯恩工作的电影院K
Rick used to draw movie posters for the theater Vaughn worked at.

1959
02:07:17,810 --> 02:07:19,870
-划过一些海报  我会寄一张给你  -谢谢
-I'll send one down. -Thank you.

1960
02:07:29,750 --> 02:07:30,850
我需要更多样本
I'll need to see more samples.

1961
02:07:31,020 --> 02:07:33,490
-好  但他是吗?  -这是我目前看过最接近的
-Yeah, but is it...  -It's as close as I've ever seen.

1962
02:07:33,660 --> 02:07:37,290
我们必须小心行事  我们要指认的这个人是黄道带
We have to tread lightly here. We're talking about implicating this man as the Zodiac.

1963
02:07:37,460 --> 02:07:40,430
我能拿到更多样本  只要找到冯恩就能找到琳达
I can get more. I'll just find Vaughn and I'll track down Linda.

1964
02:07:40,600 --> 02:07:43,970
我是说  琳达是黛琳的姐姐  我去过监理处
I mean, Linda is Darlene's sister. I've been to the DMV,

1965
02:07:44,130 --> 02:07:48,330
跟她父母谈过  不过没有人知道她在哪里
and I talked to her parents, but still, nobody knows where to find her.

1966
02:07:48,510 --> 02:07:52,970
葛先生  大部分的字迹都符合
Mr. Graysmith, most of the writing matches the exemplar.

1967
02:07:53,140 --> 02:07:56,170
不过我最怕的是不符合的部分
In a way, though, it's the part that doesn't match that scares me the most.

1968
02:07:56,350 --> 02:07:58,440
什么意思?
What do you mean?

1969
02:07:58,620 --> 02:08:01,950
电影海报上唯一不符合的字母
Well, on the poster, the one letter that absolutely, positively does not match

1970
02:08:02,120 --> 02:08:03,950
就是K
is the letter K.

1971
02:08:05,620 --> 02:08:08,850
你没有卡通动物饼干吧?
You wouldn't happen to have any animal crackers in there, would you?

1972
02:08:09,690 --> 02:08:13,490
第五小组  请陶希打回总部
Unit Five. Toschi needs to call in on a landline.

1973
02:08:21,270 --> 02:08:24,940
(1978年4月25日  加州  旧金山)

1974
02:08:25,110 --> 02:08:27,370
-勤务中心  -大卫・陶希
-Dispatch.  -Hey. Dave Toschi.

1975
02:08:27,540 --> 02:08:29,310
我帮你接
I'll connect you.

1976
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:31,470
-大卫  -什么事?
-Dave? -Yeah. What's up?

1977
02:08:31,650 --> 02:08:33,550
<旧金山纪事报>的达菲詹宁在总部
Jennings here from the Chronicle.

1978
02:08:33,720 --> 02:08:35,880
早上寄来的  你最好看看
It came in this morning and you need to see it right now.

1979
02:08:36,050 --> 02:08:37,040
看什么?
See what?

1980
02:08:37,220 --> 02:08:39,820
黄道带的信  上面提到你
The new Zodiac letter. And it mentions you.

1981
02:08:39,990 --> 02:08:41,960
好吧
Okay, okay.

1982
02:08:43,230 --> 02:08:47,490
好吧  快回总部
Shit. All right, come on. Hall of Justice!

1983
02:08:47,730 --> 02:08:51,690
快点  快K快K
Now! Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!

1984
02:08:57,170 --> 02:08:58,400
大卫
Dave!

1985
02:08:59,010 --> 02:09:01,030
你有带在身上吗?
Do you have it with you?

1986
02:09:04,580 --> 02:09:06,910
我是黄道带  我回来了
This is the Zodiac speaking. I'm back with you.

1987
02:09:07,080 --> 02:09:10,020
告诉贺伯我还在  一直都在
Tell Herb Caen I am here, I have always been here.

1988
02:09:10,190 --> 02:09:13,020
陶希很有一套  不过我更聪明
That city pig Toschi is good, but I am smarter and better.

1989
02:09:13,190 --> 02:09:16,180
他迟早会累了  然后放过我
He will get tired, then leave me alone.

1990
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:19,020
我等着有人把我拍成电影  谁会饰演我呢?
I'm waiting for a good movie about me. Who will play me?

1991
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:21,660
现在由我掌控局面
I'm now in control of all things.

1992
02:09:21,830 --> 02:09:24,390
他们来自风纪组
These guys are from Internal Affairs.

1993
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:28,070
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

1994
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:29,570
今晚新闻头条
Good evening. Our top story tonight,

1995
02:09:29,740 --> 02:09:32,170
旧金山警局证实
the San Francisco Police Department has confirmed

1996
02:09:32,340 --> 02:09:36,400
自称黄道带并吓坏湾区的凶手
that the man who calls himself the Zodiac and terrorized the Bay Area

1997
02:09:36,580 --> 02:09:39,240
51个月后打破沉默
has broken his silence of 51 months.

1998
02:09:39,420 --> 02:09:41,980
他在信中提到  我回来了
In a letter claiming, I am back with you,

1999
02:09:42,150 --> 02:09:45,880
但是并没有刻意威胁市民
the Zodiac makes no overt threats against the citizenry,

2000
02:09:46,060 --> 02:09:48,720
反而想把他的故事拍成电影
and muses that his life and times would make the best movie script yet.

2001
02:09:48,890 --> 02:09:50,950
红萝卜很好吃
These carrots are perfect.

2002
02:09:51,560 --> 02:09:53,390
-去看吧  -信中还提到<旧金山纪事报>
-Just go.  -to mention San Francisco Chronicle

2003
02:09:53,560 --> 02:09:55,960
专栏作家贺伯
columnist Herb Caen

2004
02:09:56,130 --> 02:09:58,970
和大卫陶希警探
and the Department's own David Toschi by name.

2005
02:09:59,140 --> 02:10:00,190
我也可以去吗?
May I be excused?

2006
02:10:00,370 --> 02:10:03,100
好  不过你得回来吃完一半晚餐
Fine, but you have to come back and finish at least half of what's on that plate.

2007
02:10:03,270 --> 02:10:05,940
我们有更多密码杀手的报导
More team coverage on the cipher slayer's return...

2008
02:10:06,110 --> 02:10:08,580
镜头交给艾伦・佛列曼
begins as Alan Freeman has more.

2009
02:10:08,750 --> 02:10:12,010
谢谢你 艾瑞克 <旧金山纪事报>专栏作家莫宝
Thank you, Eric. San Francisco Chronicle columnist Armistead Maupin says

2010
02:10:12,180 --> 02:10:15,020
认为这封信是伪造的
that he thinks not only is this new letter a forgery,

2011
02:10:15,190 --> 02:10:19,350
而伪造这封信的人  就是长年追捕黄道带的警探
but it was written by the very man trusted to hunt down this killer,

2012
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:22,960
大卫・陶希  莫宝这位非常受尊重的作家
David Toschi. Maupin, a very well-respected author,

2013
02:10:23,130 --> 02:10:27,260
公开表示他相信陶希伪造这封信
has gone on record saying that he believes Toschi wrote the letter

2014
02:10:27,430 --> 02:10:29,330
是为了引人注意
to drum up publicity for himself.

2015
02:10:29,500 --> 02:10:32,590
莫宝把大卫写成他专栏的角色
Maupin used David as a character in his column.

2016
02:10:32,770 --> 02:10:36,100
大卫觉得很过瘾  于是匿名写信
David got a kick out of it and so he wrote a couple of anonymous letters

2017
02:10:36,270 --> 02:10:38,430
请莫宝继续写这个角色
asking for the character to be brought back.

2018
02:10:38,610 --> 02:10:41,770
就像假装粉丝写信给自己而已
It was like writing fan mail to himself. That's all.

2019
02:10:41,950 --> 02:10:44,110
不过那封信不是大卫写的
But David did not write that letter.

2020
02:10:44,280 --> 02:10:47,270
我相信不是他  应该也不会有什么影响
No, I'm sure that he didn't. And I'm sure that this will all blow over.

2021
02:10:47,450 --> 02:10:48,610
不会有影响?
Blow over?

2022
02:10:48,790 --> 02:10:50,850
他被踢出重案组
They kicked him out of Homicide.

2023
02:10:51,020 --> 02:10:54,290
他们甚至逼他像罪犯留下笔迹
They made him give his handwriting like some common criminal.

2024
02:10:54,460 --> 02:10:57,830
-我能跟他谈谈吗?  -不行
-May I talk to him? -No.

2025
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:01,330
请你问他有没有调查过  一个叫瑞克・马修的人
Okay, can you just ask him if he ever investigated a man named Rick Marshall?

2026
02:11:01,500 --> 02:11:03,490
你满脑子只有这个案子吗?
Is that all you can think about?

2027
02:11:03,670 --> 02:11:07,260
葛先生  莫宝在你的报社工作K
Mr. Graysmith, Maupin works at your paper. We trust...

2028
02:11:12,940 --> 02:11:16,670
-这女孩想要修音乐课?  -大卫
-This girl, she wants music lessons? -Dave! Dave!

2029
02:11:17,980 --> 02:11:20,310
我待会儿再找你
I'll catch up to you.

2030
02:11:20,480 --> 02:11:22,650
别再打到我家  懂吗?
You stop calling my house. Do you understand me?

2031
02:11:22,820 --> 02:11:24,450
我只要你帮我找到琳达
I just need your help to find Linda.

2032
02:11:24,620 --> 02:11:27,320
-老天爷  -一下子就好
-Jesus. -Look, two seconds.

2033
02:11:28,660 --> 02:11:31,090
听着  我们做过一些笔迹比对
Look, we've been running handwriting samples.

2034
02:11:31,260 --> 02:11:33,350
-我们  是谁?  -我和莫瑞尔
-Who's we? -Sherwood and I.

2035
02:11:33,530 --> 02:11:36,760
莫瑞尔?  他被鉴识组开除后
Sherwood? Sherwood who was fired from Questioned Documents?

2036
02:11:36,930 --> 02:11:39,530
-他和保罗一样变成酒鬼  -他退休了
-Sherwood who drinks like Paul Avery now? -He retired.

2037
02:11:39,700 --> 02:11:41,190
他这么跟你说吗?
Is that what he told you?

2038
02:11:41,370 --> 02:11:45,330
-你是说他错了吗?  -我是说别再打到我家
-What, are you saying he's wrong? -I'm saying stop calling my house.

2039
02:11:46,080 --> 02:11:47,910
-我们比对瑞克・马修的笔迹  -不  罗伯
-We ran them on Rick Marshall. -No, Robert.

2040
02:11:48,080 --> 02:11:51,710
-我知道你认为不是他  -我只知道我不想再说下去
-No, I know you don't think it's him. -I mean,no,I am not having this conversation.

2041
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:54,150
我找不到梅休或琳达
I can't talk to Mageau or Linda,so I'm gonna talk to Bob Vaughn.

2042
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:55,840
罗伯  闭嘴
Robert. Robert, stop it!

2043
02:11:56,020 --> 02:11:59,680
你再调查下去会筋疲力尽  也会走进死胡同
Okay, the Rick Marshalls of this world will suck you dry. They're blind alleys.

2044
02:11:59,860 --> 02:12:02,850
黄道带说他不会公布他的对象  他只会直接杀人
But he said he wasn't gonna announce his murders anymore, Dave. He was just gonna do them.

2045
02:12:03,030 --> 02:12:05,890
你知道逮到他的机率有多小?
Do you know what the chances of us arresting someone are now?

2046
02:12:06,060 --> 02:12:10,060
而且时间过了这么久  很多证物都遗失
Too much time has gone by, okay? Too much of the evidence is lost.

2047
02:12:10,230 --> 02:12:13,140
证人也老了  忘记很多事
People get old, Robert. They forget.

2048
02:12:13,540 --> 02:12:17,560
我当了25年警察  12年  凶案警探
Now, I have been a cop for 25 years. Murder police for 12.

2049
02:12:17,740 --> 02:12:19,540
-你靠什么维生?  -你明明知道
-What do you do for a living? -You know what I do for a living.

2050
02:12:19,710 --> 02:12:22,300
-你是个漫画家  -你想说什么?
-You're a cartoonist. -So what are you saying?

2051
02:12:22,480 --> 02:12:26,580
逮捕黄道带是我的工作  不是你的
I am saying Zodiac was my job. It is not yours.

2052
02:12:28,790 --> 02:12:31,220
-他还在逍遥法外  大卫  -我不管这个案子了
-He's still out there, Dave. -No, Robert. I am through with this.

2053
02:12:31,390 --> 02:12:33,450
也跟你没关系了
I am through with you.

2054
02:12:39,560 --> 02:12:42,230
1970年9月24日呢?
What about September 26, 1970?

2055
02:12:42,400 --> 02:12:46,390
-那是哪一起命案?  -太浩湖护士失踪
-Okay, which one was that? -The Lake Tahoe nurse goes missing.

2056
02:12:48,640 --> 02:12:52,040
-春分点的前一天  爸?  -划个记号
-One day before the vernal equinox. Dad? -Yeah. Mark that.

2057
02:12:52,210 --> 02:12:55,540
还有1971年6月19日
Got another one. June 19th, 1971.

2058
02:12:55,710 --> 02:12:58,810
一定很接近夏至
That's got to be near the summer solstice.

2059
02:13:00,950 --> 02:13:05,450
大伙儿  别告诉妈妈这件事哦
Oh, guys. Don't tell Mom about our special project, okay?

2060
02:13:06,090 --> 02:13:09,460
你跟妈为什么不一起睡?
How come you and Mom don't sleep in the same bed anymore?

2061
02:13:13,630 --> 02:13:16,260
葛先生  我是那帕警局的肯恩
Mr. Graysmith, it's Ken Narlow from Napa.

2062
02:13:16,430 --> 02:13:20,430
你好  警官  谢谢你回电
Oh, Captain Narlow. Thank you for calling me back.

2063
02:13:20,600 --> 02:13:22,270
我能帮什么忙?
Yeah. How can I help?

2064
02:13:22,440 --> 02:13:25,310
我们交叉比对月亮周期
I called you because we've been cross-referencing lunar cycles

2065
02:13:25,480 --> 02:13:26,970
和黄道带凶杀案的时间表
with the Zodiac's timeline.

2066
02:13:27,140 --> 02:13:30,670
1969年以后  月亮周期一开始  就有一起命案
More often than not, each cycle since '69 corresponds with an attack

2067
02:13:30,850 --> 02:13:34,110
和一封信  或是未破解的谋杀案
or with one of the letters, or an unsolved homicide.

2068
02:13:34,280 --> 02:13:37,150
-谁跟你调查这件事?  -我的同事
-Who's working with you on this? -Some colleagues.

2069
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:38,550
爸?
Dad?

2070
02:13:39,490 --> 02:13:41,920
-请你稍等一下  -爸?
-Ken, can you hold on one second? -Dad?

2071
02:13:42,360 --> 02:13:44,350
-什么事?  -这是什么?
-What is it? -What's this?

2072
02:13:48,130 --> 02:13:51,330
收到黄道带最后信件的十年间
In the decade since the Zodiac's last cipher was received,

2073
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:54,730
每个联邦单位都想破解密码
every federal agency has taken a crack at decoding it.

2074
02:13:54,910 --> 02:13:56,130
(1979年8月9日-  加州  旧金山)

2075
02:13:56,310 --> 02:14:00,210
在这些单位都失败之后  一名漫画家却成功破解密码
But today, where those agencies had failed, a cartoonist has succeeded.

2076
02:14:00,380 --> 02:14:02,680
你是怎么办到的?
How did you do it?

2077
02:14:02,850 --> 02:14:05,940
参考图书馆的大量书籍
Oh, just a lot of books from the library,

2078
02:14:06,120 --> 02:14:09,780
我也喜欢解码  我就K
and I love puzzles, so I just...

2079
02:14:09,950 --> 02:14:12,150
臭图书馆
Yeah. The fucking library.

2080
02:14:12,320 --> 02:14:15,310
只要努力就一定能成功
I believe that you can accomplish anything that you put your mind...

2081
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:21,800
J字开头?  女子监狱?
That's a J? Okay. Honor Camp?

2082
02:14:22,570 --> 02:14:24,470
谢谢你
Thank you so much.

2083
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,730
找到琳达了  她在坐牢  很棒吧
Hey, we found Linda. She's in jail. Isn't that great?

2084
02:14:28,910 --> 02:14:30,900
-你为什么要这样?  -她会指认瑞克K
-Why'd you do it? -Because she'll be able to identify Rick...

2085
02:14:31,070 --> 02:14:34,410
-你在说什么?  -你上了电视
-What are you talking about? -You went on TV.

2086
02:14:34,580 --> 02:14:37,840
-你让他认得你的长相  -老婆  你太紧张了
-You put yourself out there for him to see. -Oh, hon, you're being paranoid.

2087
02:14:38,020 --> 02:14:41,010
那是谁每周半夜打到家里来的?
The who's been calling our house in the middle of the night?

2088
02:14:41,180 --> 02:14:43,310
谁也不是
Nobody.

2089
02:14:44,090 --> 02:14:47,280
-你要怎样才肯罢休?  -现在不能谈
-What's it gonna take for you to be done with this? -I can't talk about this now.

2090
02:14:47,460 --> 02:14:48,790
我得去见鲍伯冯恩
I have to go see Bob Vaughn.

2091
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:52,050
不行  我们现在就要谈
Well, that's too bad, because we're gonna talk about this.

2092
02:14:52,230 --> 02:14:56,390
你几时才会罢手?  等你找到他  逮捕他?
And when is it gonna be finished? When you catch him? When you arrest him?

2093
02:14:56,570 --> 02:14:59,030
-严肃一点  -我是很严肃
-Be serious. -I am serious.

2094
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:05,340
我得知道他究竟是谁
I need to know who he is.

2095
02:15:05,940 --> 02:15:09,570
我得站在他面前  看着他的眼睛
I need to stand there, I need to look him in the eye

2096
02:15:09,750 --> 02:15:12,720
知道他就是黄道带
and I need to know that it's him.

2097
02:15:13,350 --> 02:15:15,720
这比你家人的安危更重要?
Is that more important than your family's safety?

2098
02:15:15,890 --> 02:15:18,010
当然不是
Of course not.

2099
02:15:19,390 --> 02:15:22,360
为什么?  你为什么要这么做?
Why? Why do you need to do this?

2100
02:15:23,390 --> 02:15:24,830
为什么?
Why?

2101
02:15:26,660 --> 02:15:28,290
因为没有人肯做
Because nobody else will.

2102
02:15:28,470 --> 02:15:29,960
这理由不够好
That's not good enough.

2103
02:15:30,770 --> 02:15:32,260
说完了吗?  我能走了吗?
Are you done? Can I go?

2104
02:15:48,050 --> 02:15:50,080
-冯先生?  -葛先生?
-Mr. Vaughn? -Mr. Graysmith?

2105
02:15:50,250 --> 02:15:52,590
-是的  嗨  -你要找我谈?
-Yes. -Hi. You needed to speak to me?

2106
02:15:52,760 --> 02:15:54,990
对  街角有一家咖啡馆
Yes. There's a coffee shop right on the corner.

2107
02:15:55,160 --> 02:15:58,250
-不如到我家  -我不想麻烦你
-Why don't we just go to my home? -Oh, I don't wanna put you out.

2108
02:15:58,430 --> 02:16:01,160
一点也不会  你停在哪儿?
It's no trouble at all. Where are you parked?

2109
02:16:01,330 --> 02:16:02,420
就在那里
Just right there.

2110
02:16:02,600 --> 02:16:04,260
跟着我的车
You can follow me.

2111
02:16:05,770 --> 02:16:07,000
好吧
Oh. Okay.

2112
02:16:24,820 --> 02:16:26,480
小心脚步
Watch your step.

2113
02:16:31,030 --> 02:16:34,290
-很棒的房子  -谢谢
-Very nice house. -Oh, thank you.

2114
02:16:34,460 --> 02:16:36,190
感觉很简朴
It's very rustic.

2115
02:16:36,370 --> 02:16:39,300
-夹克可以给我吗?  -不用  谢谢  我很好
-Can I take your jacket? -No, thank you, I'm fine.

2116
02:16:39,470 --> 02:16:42,370
那就这边请
Okay. This way, please.

2117
02:16:44,370 --> 02:16:46,070
-请坐  -谢谢
-Have a seat. -Thank you.

2118
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:48,640
-喝点茶吗?  -不用了
-How about some tea? -Oh, no, I'm all right.

2119
02:16:48,810 --> 02:16:51,080
-你确定?  -确定
-You sure? -Yes.

2120
02:16:51,250 --> 02:16:54,880
我想问你关于一部电影
I wanted to ask you about a film that the Avenue may have played

2121
02:16:55,050 --> 02:16:59,180
你在电影院当琴师时放过的电影  <最危险的游戏>
while you were the organist there. The Most Dangerous Game?

2122
02:16:59,360 --> 02:17:02,660
那是经典电影  1932年
Oh, it's a classic. R KO. 1932.

2123
02:17:02,830 --> 02:17:07,350
费芮  乔・麦克雷  莱斯里・班克斯 我们放映了很多次
Fay Wray, Joel McCrea, Leslie Banks. We've run that picture many times.

2124
02:17:07,530 --> 02:17:09,230
是68还是69年?
In '68, '69?

2125
02:17:10,830 --> 02:17:12,800
我得查查记录  怎么了?
I'd have to check my records. Why?

2126
02:17:12,970 --> 02:17:14,870
你记得黄道带吗?
Do you remember the Zodiac?

2127
02:17:17,340 --> 02:17:19,600
你想问瑞克・马修  是吧?
This is about Rick Marshall, isn't it?

2128
02:17:19,780 --> 02:17:23,510
-他曾是那里的放映师  对吗?  -有一段时间
-He was a projectionist there, right? -For a time, yes.

2129
02:17:23,680 --> 02:17:27,410
但是我没跟他保持连络
But I have no occasion to correspond with him these days.

2130
02:17:27,580 --> 02:17:29,850
好  黄道带有一次
Okay. Well, there is a connection

2131
02:17:30,020 --> 02:17:32,580
杀人时  跟那部电影有关联
between one of the Zodiac attacks and that film.

2132
02:17:32,760 --> 02:17:34,520
你是说那个符号?
You mean the symbol?

2133
02:17:35,890 --> 02:17:37,590
等等
Hold on.

2134
02:17:37,760 --> 02:17:42,760
黄道带的符号  出现在片头的倒数胶卷
The Zodiac symbol on film. It's on the countdown.

2135
02:17:45,600 --> 02:17:48,330
每次放映前都会剪掉
It's trimmed off each reel before it's shown,

2136
02:17:48,510 --> 02:17:50,530
不过影片送来的时候都会在
but it always arrives with it.

2137
02:17:50,710 --> 02:17:52,700
就在这里
Right there.

2138
02:17:53,210 --> 02:17:57,010
我第一次在报上看到时就想到了
The first time I saw it in the papers, I thought about that.

2139
02:17:57,510 --> 02:17:58,610
我们收到线报
We got a tip

2140
02:17:58,780 --> 02:18:03,220
瑞克留了一个胶卷盒给你  还交代你不要打开
that Rick left a film canister here that he told you never to open.

2141
02:18:03,390 --> 02:18:06,220
关于神秘的影片胶卷盒线报
A tip about a mysterious film canister?

2142
02:18:07,220 --> 02:18:08,710
是真的吗?
Is it true?

2143
02:18:10,460 --> 02:18:11,690
是真的
Yes.

2144
02:18:12,130 --> 02:18:14,600
-你有打开过吗?  -没有
-Did you open it? -No.

2145
02:18:14,760 --> 02:18:20,290
-我能看看吗?  -瑞克在1972年拿回去了
-May I see it? -Rick took it back in 1972.

2146
02:18:20,900 --> 02:18:25,470
这条线报让你联想到  瑞克就是黄道带?
This tip is how you got it in your head that Rick is the Zodiac?

2147
02:18:25,640 --> 02:18:27,230
胶卷盒以及海报
That and the poster.

2148
02:18:27,410 --> 02:18:29,610
海报?
The poster?

2149
02:18:30,750 --> 02:18:32,310
瑞克划的那张海报
The poster that Rick drew.

2150
02:18:32,480 --> 02:18:35,470
上面的笔迹是最接近嫌犯的笔迹
The handwriting is the closest that we have ever come to a match.

2151
02:18:35,650 --> 02:18:37,480
海报不是瑞克划的
Rick didn't draw any posters.

2152
02:18:37,650 --> 02:18:39,120
不  他划了这张
No, he drew this one.

2153
02:18:39,290 --> 02:18:43,620
葛先生  海报是我亲笔划的
Mr. Graysmith, I do the posters myself.

2154
02:18:43,790 --> 02:18:46,190
那是我的笔迹
That's my handwriting.

2155
02:18:54,170 --> 02:18:57,070
我K我不想再占用你的时间了
I won't take any more of your time.

2156
02:18:57,240 --> 02:19:02,580
我去看是哪一年放映这部电影的
Why don't I just go and find out when we played that film?

2157
02:19:02,750 --> 02:19:04,110
不用了
Oh, that's all right.

2158
02:19:04,280 --> 02:19:08,340
没关系  就在地下室
It's not a problem. They're just down in the basement.

2159
02:19:09,450 --> 02:19:12,510
加州不是每个人都有地下室
Not many people have basements in California.

2160
02:19:15,190 --> 02:19:16,720
我就有
I do.

2161
02:19:18,230 --> 02:19:20,530
你要来吗  葛先生?
You coming, Mr. Graysmith?

2162
02:19:31,740 --> 02:19:36,300
原版的海报我全都自己保留
The original studio one-sheets, I always kept for myself.

2163
02:19:37,280 --> 02:19:40,310
你带来的那张便宜货
The cheapo knock-offs like you brought today

2164
02:19:40,480 --> 02:19:42,950
我会糅成一团丢到后巷
I end up tossing into the back alley.

2165
02:19:57,330 --> 02:19:59,500
69年
'69.

2166
02:20:04,810 --> 02:20:05,900
你一个人住吗?
You live alone?

2167
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:12,020
<最危险的游戏>  1969年5月放映
Most Dangerous Game ran in May '69.

2168
02:20:12,180 --> 02:20:18,520
那大概是黄道带  寄出第一封信九星期前  对吧?
So, that would be about nine weeks before the first Zodiac letter, correct?

2169
02:20:21,520 --> 02:20:23,190
对
Yeah.

2170
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:31,060
你认为他在戏院中看过那部电影后  受到启发?
Do you think he saw the film in our theater and was inspired?

2171
02:20:37,370 --> 02:20:39,840
你确定屋里没有别人?
Are you sure there's nobody else in the house?

2172
02:20:41,780 --> 02:20:44,010
你想上楼去看吗?
Would you like to go upstairs and check?

2173
02:20:45,250 --> 02:20:46,940
不了
No.

2174
02:20:49,390 --> 02:20:52,750
谢谢  非常谢谢你
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

2175
02:20:52,920 --> 02:20:54,620
不用客气
You're welcome.

2176
02:21:15,710 --> 02:21:17,370
大门锁住了
It's locked.

2177
02:21:27,890 --> 02:21:29,190
谢谢你
Thank you.

2178
02:21:32,260 --> 02:21:34,920
晚安  葛先生
Good night, Mr. Graysmith!

2179
02:21:55,190 --> 02:21:59,880
一定有两个凶手  其中一个...
Two killers. Got to be two killers. One has the...

2180
02:22:05,860 --> 02:22:07,350
孩子们?
Guys?

2181
02:22:26,450 --> 02:22:28,350
(我带孩子到我妈家  别打来)

2182
02:22:36,430 --> 02:22:38,450
(琳达  戴布诺  桑瓦昆监狱)

2183
02:22:40,700 --> 02:22:42,860
你有五分钟的时间
You've got five minutes.

2184
02:22:50,610 --> 02:22:52,270
琳达?
Linda?

2185
02:22:52,810 --> 02:22:54,710
我是罗伯
Hi, I'm Robert.

2186
02:22:58,480 --> 02:23:00,780
你收到我的信吗?
Did you get my note?

2187
02:23:00,950 --> 02:23:02,980
-是什么事?  -黄道带
-What's this about? -Zodiac.

2188
02:23:04,620 --> 02:23:06,350
我猜也是
Figures.

2189
02:23:06,990 --> 02:23:09,480
-你看起来有那种样子  -什么样子?
-You got the look. -What look?

2190
02:23:10,090 --> 02:23:12,430
我没别的意思
I didn't mean anything.

2191
02:23:13,330 --> 02:23:16,030
告诉我关于那场油漆派对
Tell me about this painting party.

2192
02:23:16,670 --> 02:23:19,730
我很久前就跟条子说过
I told the cops about that so long ago.

2193
02:23:22,810 --> 02:23:26,540
男人总是围绕着黛琳  就算是婚后也一样
Darlene always had a lot of boys around, even though she was married.

2194
02:23:26,710 --> 02:23:29,410
其中有一个很怪
And this one guy was weird, though.

2195
02:23:29,580 --> 02:23:33,410
他常从提华纳带礼物给她
He used to bring her presents from Tijuana and...

2196
02:23:33,580 --> 02:23:36,180
我也不知道她干嘛跟他交朋友
I don't know why she was friends with him.

2197
02:23:36,350 --> 02:23:38,580
不过她说他杀过人
She once told me he'd killed somebody.

2198
02:23:38,760 --> 02:23:40,150
真的吗?
Really?

2199
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:42,660
好像是他在当兵的时候
Yeah, I think maybe when he was in the service.

2200
02:23:42,830 --> 02:23:44,760
-海军?  -应该是吧
-Navy? -I think so.

2201
02:23:44,930 --> 02:23:46,920
他喜欢电影?  他是影痴吗?
Was he into movies? Was he a movie buff?

2202
02:23:47,100 --> 02:23:49,560
我只知道他对人没兴趣
I can tell you that he was not into people.

2203
02:23:49,730 --> 02:23:52,790
黛琳办的那个派对  只是请大家来喝酒
The party Darlene threw, people were supposed to just show up and drink beer,

2204
02:23:52,970 --> 02:23:54,460
帮忙油漆
help paint.

2205
02:23:54,640 --> 02:23:56,660
这家伙却穿了套西装
But this guy showed up in a suit,

2206
02:23:56,840 --> 02:23:59,670
一个人整晚坐在椅子上
and just sat in a chair all by himself all night long.

2207
02:23:59,840 --> 02:24:01,400
也没跟任何人讲话
Didn't talk to anyone.

2208
02:24:01,580 --> 02:24:05,340
黛琳叫我离他远一点  她很怕他
And Darlene told me to stay away from him. She was scared of him.

2209
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:09,880
几星期后她就死了
And a couple of weeks later, she was dead.

2210
02:24:10,050 --> 02:24:12,720
很遗憾  你知道他的名字吗?
I'm sorry. Do you remember his name?

2211
02:24:13,590 --> 02:24:17,250
有点像绰号  好像是史丹
I mean, it was short, like a nickname, like Stan.

2212
02:24:17,530 --> 02:24:20,500
-瑞克?  -不  我想不是
-Rick? -No, I don't think so.

2213
02:24:20,660 --> 02:24:22,790
-你确定吗?  -确定
-Are you sure? -Yeah.

2214
02:24:22,970 --> 02:24:25,460
那么久了  你怎么能确定?  用力想
How can you be sure? It was a long time ago. Think hard.

2215
02:24:25,640 --> 02:24:27,000
我很用力在想
I am thinking hard.

2216
02:24:27,740 --> 02:24:29,860
是瑞克
It was Rick.

2217
02:24:30,040 --> 02:24:32,970
-不  不是  -是瑞克  瑞克・马修
No, it wasn't. -It was Rick. It was Rick Marshall.

2218
02:24:33,140 --> 02:24:35,510
-不是  -快说是
-No. -Just say it!

2219
02:24:35,680 --> 02:24:38,510
他不是瑞克
It wasn't Rick.

2220
02:24:49,960 --> 02:24:51,290
是李
It was Leigh.

2221
02:24:54,590 --> 02:24:57,760
-李?  -是啊  李
-Leigh? -Yeah, Leigh.

2222
02:24:58,400 --> 02:24:59,730
听起来没错
Sounds right.

2223
02:25:04,470 --> 02:25:05,800
警官!
Officer!

2224
02:25:05,970 --> 02:25:08,370
-你得让我进去  -是紧急事件吗?
-I need you to let me in. -Is this an emergency?

2225
02:25:08,540 --> 02:25:10,130
我只要看一份档案
No, I just need to see one file.

2226
02:25:10,310 --> 02:25:13,510
-明早再来  -一份档案  只要一下子
-No, you need to come back tomorrow morning. -One file, just for one second.

2227
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:15,310
穆拉斯队长!
Sergeant! Sergeant Mulanax!

2228
02:25:15,480 --> 02:25:18,810
我只要看一份档案  五分钟
Sergeant, I just need to see one file! Just give me five minutes.

2229
02:25:18,980 --> 02:25:21,210
我知道档案在哪里
I know exactly where it is.

2230
02:25:22,390 --> 02:25:23,850
拜托
Please!

2231
02:25:36,900 --> 02:25:38,660
我不应该跟你说话
I shouldn't be talking to you.

2232
02:25:38,840 --> 02:25:41,100
-你只有五分钟  -好
-You got five minutes. -Okay.

2233
02:25:42,910 --> 02:25:44,240
就是这里
Here. Here.

2234
02:25:44,410 --> 02:25:48,000
琳达说她的好朋友包括李
Linda states that some of Darlene's closest friends are Leigh,

2236
02:25:51,320 --> 02:25:53,010

-So what? -He knew her.

2237
02:25:53,180 --> 02:25:54,850
琳达提到李
Linda said Leigh. This is Leigh.

2238
02:25:55,020 --> 02:25:59,010
这只是几百个名字的其中一个  不算什么
No. That's just one name in a file that contains hundreds. It's nothing.

2239
02:25:59,490 --> 02:26:02,430
-大卫陶希K  -他也同意我说的
-Dave Toschi... -Agrees with me.

2240
02:26:02,590 --> 02:26:05,590

Our investigation into this subject is over.

2241

很抱歉
I'm sorry.

2242
02:26:18,840 --> 02:26:20,330

是啊  看得出来
Yeah. I can see that.

2246
02:26:47,710 --> 02:26:49,170
书写得怎样?
How's the book coming?

2247
02:26:52,540 --> 02:26:54,980
我试着寄这些给你
I tried to send you these.

2248
02:26:55,580 --> 02:26:57,340
我打给了报社
I called the Chron.

2249
02:26:57,520 --> 02:27:01,850
我不再是那里的漫画家了
Well, I'm not a cartoonist anymore, so...

你最后一次吃过东西是在什么时候?
When's the last time you ate something?

2252
02:27:13,470 --> 02:27:15,160
一切都没有意义了
Nothing makes sense anymore.

2253
02:27:18,170 --> 02:27:19,660
有过意义吗?
Did it ever?

2254
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:21,930
有  曾经有
Yeah, it did.

2255
02:27:22,110 --> 02:27:24,470
罗伯  那只是一次约会  并没有结束
Robert, it was just the date that didn't end.

2256
02:27:25,480 --> 02:27:27,140
你真的这么想?
You don't mean that.

2257
02:27:28,480 --> 02:27:30,070
有一点
A little.

2258
02:27:32,620 --> 02:27:34,380
孩子们很想你
The kids miss you.

2259
02:27:34,550 --> 02:27:36,450
我不能让他们看到我这样
I can't have them see me like this.

2260
02:27:36,620 --> 02:27:40,720
-我也不想  -把你认为该做的事做完
-Neither can I. -So, do whatever you have to,

2261
02:27:41,360 --> 02:27:43,120
把这本书写完
but finish this.

-You have to hear this! -No, I don't, Robert!

2273

他只有在生日那天最脆弱
The birthday was the one time that he was weak!

2281
02:29:08,110 --> 02:29:11,050
-拿去  -谢了
-Here you go. -Thanks.

2282
02:29:13,320 --> 02:29:15,220
他写信给我  你知道吗?
He wrote me, you know?

2283
02:29:15,790 --> 02:29:19,880
2500名嫌犯  唯一写信给我的就是李艾伦
2,500 suspects, the only one who ever wrote me a letter was Leigh Allen.

2284
02:29:21,590 --> 02:29:25,030
-有时候嫌犯想帮忙  -我知道  罗伯
-They like to help, you know, sometimes. -Yes, Robert, I know.

2285
02:29:26,360 --> 02:29:29,030
他在1975年1月因性骚扰被捕
He was arrested January 1975 for molestation.

2286
02:29:29,200 --> 02:29:30,830
一出狱就寄信给我
He sent me that when he got out.

2287
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,730
亲爱的大卫  需要帮忙就告诉我
Dear Dave, if I can ever be of any help to you, just let me know.

2288
02:29:33,910 --> 02:29:37,310
抱歉我不是凶手  而信件是用打的
I'm sorry I wasn't your man. And it's typewritten.

2289
02:29:37,480 --> 02:29:40,140
打字并不算犯法
Using a typewriter is not a crime.

2290
02:29:41,410 --> 02:29:43,570
他也认识黛琳
And he knew Darlene.

2291
02:29:44,480 --> 02:29:46,780
这是瓦列霍的档案
It's in the Vallejo files.

2292
02:29:51,690 --> 02:29:55,150
穆拉斯说他是你的头号嫌犯
Mulanax said that he was your favorite suspect.

2293
02:29:55,330 --> 02:29:59,920
你花两年时间调查他  而且没人比你更接近破案
That you spent two years on him, and that nobody ever came close.

2294
02:30:02,200 --> 02:30:04,360
所有的证据都说不是他
All the evidence said no.

2295
02:30:05,440 --> 02:30:07,600
莫瑞尔说他的笔迹不符合
Sherwood disqualified his handwriting.

2296
02:30:07,770 --> 02:30:10,940
那个和保罗一样满嘴酒味的莫瑞尔?
The same Sherwood that drinks like Paul Avery now?

2297
02:30:12,010 --> 02:30:15,840
是的  莫瑞尔写说这不是嫌犯的笔迹  泰瑞也能鉴定
Yes, you have Sherwood Morrill in writing saying,

2298
02:30:16,010 --> 02:30:17,500
-他的徒弟  -就算他只是徒弟
-His prentice. -Yeah, fine, it's his prentice,

2299
02:30:17,680 --> 02:30:19,450
好歹他也是专家  他说
but he's a handwriting expert nonetheless, and he's saying,

2300
02:30:19,620 --> 02:30:21,950
别以笔迹排除掉这名嫌犯
Do not disqualify this suspect on the basis of handwriting.

2301
02:30:22,120 --> 02:30:23,780
所以两名专家意见不同
So the two cancel each other out.

2302
02:30:23,960 --> 02:30:27,650
不  这是莫瑞尔的案子  他也曾是鉴识组组长
No, they don't. It was Sherwood's case. He was the head of Questioned Documents.

2303
02:30:27,830 --> 02:30:32,090
假如案子上了法庭  辩方会让莫瑞尔证明李艾伦没罪
If it went to trial, all the defense would have to do is call Sherwood to the stand.

2304
02:30:32,260 --> 02:30:34,640
我们也没办法把艾伦告上法庭 
And there was no way of getting Allen into court in the first place,

2305
02:30:34,641 --> 02:30:36,170
 因为根本没有证据
because there was no evidence,Robert.

2306
02:30:36,330 --> 02:30:38,670
怎么会没有证据?  你看过他的密码
What do you mean, there's no evidence? You have him seen with the ciphers.

2307
02:30:38,840 --> 02:30:41,030
军用长靴和手套的尺寸符合
The military boot prints. The same size shoes and gloves.

2308
02:30:41,210 --> 02:30:44,700
<最危险的游戏>  黄道带手表  他当过小学老师
The Most Dangerous Game. The Zodiac watch. The background with school children.

2309
02:30:44,880 --> 02:30:48,440
-圣诞节拼错  沾血凶刀  这些都是间接证据  -依据所有情况
-The misspellings of Christ-mass. The bloody knives. -All circumstantial.

2310
02:30:48,610 --> 02:30:51,380
保罗史坦的衬衫  钱包  钥匙
Paul Stine's shirt, his wallet, his keys.

2311
02:30:51,550 --> 02:30:55,040
在拖车屋里都没有找到
We should have found one of those things in that trailer. We didn't.

2312
02:30:57,590 --> 02:31:01,420
凯萨琳说李星期五下班后
Okay. Catherine Allen states that Leigh cleaned out his trailer on Friday after work

2313
02:31:01,590 --> 02:31:05,430
就把拖车屋清空搬到圣塔罗莎  1971年8月7日  星期六
 and moved it to Santa Rosa on Saturday, August 7th, 1971.

2314
02:31:05,600 --> 02:31:09,050
你是在8月4日  到炼油厂问他话的
You interviewed him at the refinery on August 4th.

2315
02:31:09,230 --> 02:31:10,686
然后48小时之后 
So, he's cleaning out his trailer,

2316
02:31:10,687 --> 02:31:12,790
 他就匆匆搬到另一个城市?
he's moving into a different county 48 hours after you interviewed him?

2317
02:31:14,940 --> 02:31:16,100
好吧  好吧
Okay. Okay.

2318
02:31:16,270 --> 02:31:18,830
-让我们一对一比对他们的行踪  -好
-Look at the stuff side by side, Dave.  -All right.

2319
02:31:19,010 --> 02:31:21,740
亚瑟・李・艾伦和黄道带的行踪
Okay, Arthur Leigh Allen and the Zodiac, their timelines.

2320
02:31:21,910 --> 02:31:24,580
-第一起瓦列霍命案是几时?  -1968年圣诞节
-When was the first murder in Vallejo? -Christmas, 1968.

2321
02:31:24,750 --> 02:31:27,550
8个月前艾伦  因骚扰学童被开除
Eight months before that, Allen is fired for molesting his students

2322
02:31:27,720 --> 02:31:29,550
家人发现他有恋童癖
and his family discovers that he's a pedophile.

2323
02:31:29,720 --> 02:31:31,880
-第一封信几时寄到?  -69年7月
-Now, when do the letters begin? -July, '69.

2324
02:31:32,060 --> 02:31:34,050
那是在黛琳・费伦的命案之后
After the murder of Darlene Ferrin.

2325
02:31:34,230 --> 02:31:36,630
他一直寄信  直到你去上班的地方找他
And they continue until you go to see him at work.

2326
02:31:36,790 --> 02:31:40,130
后来的信  还有没有史坦的沾血衬衫?
Now, after that, do any of the letters contain swatches of Paul Stine's shirt?

2327
02:31:40,300 --> 02:31:41,615
没有  因为他害怕  
No. Because he dumped them, because he got scared.

2328
02:31:41,616 --> 02:31:43,290
把衬衫丢了  他知道你盯上他
 Because he knew that you were on to him.

2329
02:31:43,470 --> 02:31:45,400
黄道带的下一封信几时出现?
So, when's the next letter from Zodiac?

2330
02:31:45,570 --> 02:31:47,770
一直等到1974年1月
Not until January of 1974.

2331
02:31:47,940 --> 02:31:49,300
他整整沉默了三年
He is silent for three years.

2332
02:31:49,470 --> 02:31:50,890
到了74年他才安心
Then, in '74, he feels comfortable 

2333
02:31:50,891 --> 02:31:53,100
  因为大家都排除艾伦的嫌疑
again because everybody's moved off Allen as a suspect.

2334
02:31:53,280 --> 02:31:57,770
接着我们陆续收到黄道带的三封信  74年1月  5月  7月
And what do we get? Three new letters from Zodiac in January, May, and July in '74.

2335
02:31:58,450 --> 02:32:00,940
-然后又没再收到信了  -艾伦发生什么事?
-But then the letters stop. -What happens to Allen?

2336
02:32:05,190 --> 02:32:07,350
他被逮捕了
He's arrested.

2337
02:32:07,530 --> 02:32:10,760
1975年1月  他被送到阿塔斯卡戴罗监狱
January, 1975, they send him to Atascadero.

2338
02:32:10,930 --> 02:32:13,620
那段期间黄道带没有寄一封信
We don't get another letter from Zodiac the entire time he's there.

2339
02:32:13,800 --> 02:32:16,460
-他几时被放出来的?  -1977年8月
-When is he released? -August, '77.

2340
02:32:16,630 --> 02:32:20,300
艾伦出狱  打了一封抱歉信  然后呢?
Allen gets out. He types you an apology, and then what?

2341
02:32:20,470 --> 02:32:23,570
四年来首次接到黄道带的信件
We get our first new Zodiac letter in four years.

2342
02:32:29,410 --> 02:32:32,580
所以  黄道带应该认识黛琳  对吧?
Okay. Zodiac had to have known Darlene Ferrin, right?

2343
02:32:32,750 --> 02:32:35,080
对  刺因为她被杀那天晚上的  通联纪录
Yes, because of the phone calls on the night of her murder.

2344
02:32:35,250 --> 02:32:39,820
因为透过瓦列霍档案纪录  我们知道黛琳认识一名男子叫李
Because of the Vallejo file, we know that Darlene knew a man named Leigh?

2345
02:32:39,990 --> 02:32:42,820
-没错  -因此撇开所有的巧合  罗伯
-Yes. -So, all coincidence aside, Robert,

2346
02:32:42,990 --> 02:32:45,860
你如何确定这两人是同一个李
how can you be sure that Leigh Allen is the Leigh from this file?

2347
02:32:46,030 --> 02:32:48,030
瓦列霍虽然是小镇  但也不太小
Now, Vallejo is a small town, but it's not that small.

2348
02:32:48,030 --> 02:32:49,630
你怎么把这两个人凑在一块?
How do you put the two of them together?

2349
02:32:49,800 --> 02:32:52,460
这是一个涵盖南北加州的案件
This is a case that's covered both Northern and Southern California,

2350
02:32:52,640 --> 02:32:55,500
嫌犯与被害人相隔一百英里
with victims and suspects spread over hundreds of miles.

2351
02:32:55,670 --> 02:32:57,900
-这你同意吧?  -同意
-Would you agree? -Yes.

2352
02:32:58,780 --> 02:33:01,270
黛琳在瓦列霍一家煎饼店工作
Darlene Ferrin worked at the Vallejo House of Pancakes

2353
02:33:01,450 --> 02:33:03,470
就在田纳西和凯罗街口
on the corner of Tennessee and Caroll.

2354
02:33:06,950 --> 02:33:11,180
亚瑟・李・艾伦  住在费斯诺街母亲家的地下室
Arthur Leigh Allen lived in his mother's basement on Fresno Street.

2355
02:33:13,460 --> 02:33:18,020
两栋房子距离不到50码
Door to door, that is less than 50 yards.

2356
02:33:20,230 --> 02:33:21,560
这是真的吗?
Is that true?

2357
02:33:22,830 --> 02:33:24,600
我实际走过
I've walked it.

2358
02:33:28,110 --> 02:33:30,100
老天爷
Jesus Christ.

2359
02:33:36,250 --> 02:33:37,910
所以呢?
So?

2360
02:33:41,190 --> 02:33:44,150
-指纹  笔迹  -我不要你以警察的身分回答
-The prints, the handwriting. -I'm not asking you as a cop.

2361
02:33:44,320 --> 02:33:46,310
但我是个警察啊
But I am a cop.

2362
02:33:48,730 --> 02:33:50,490
我无法证实
I can't prove this.

2363
02:33:50,660 --> 02:33:53,760
你无法证实不表示不是真的
Just because you can't prove it, doesn't mean it's not true.

2364
02:33:53,930 --> 02:33:56,020
别冲动  辣手神探
Easy, Dirty Harry.

2365
02:33:59,140 --> 02:34:00,900
完成你的书
Finish the book.

2366
02:34:09,580 --> 02:34:12,880
谢谢  谢谢你的早餐
Thank you. Thank you for breakfast.

2367
02:34:36,810 --> 02:34:41,570
(1983年12月20日  加州  瓦列霍)

2368
02:35:20,280 --> 02:35:21,950
我能效劳吗?
Can I help you?

2369
02:35:23,550 --> 02:35:24,950
不用
No.

2370
02:35:55,790 --> 02:36:01,120
(七年半后  加州  安大略  1991年8月16日)

2371
02:36:08,600 --> 02:36:10,260
(<索命黄道带>  畅销书)

2372
02:36:45,640 --> 02:36:47,300
梅休先生
Mr. Mageau.

2373
02:36:47,910 --> 02:36:51,430
-感谢你抽空过来  -你就是电话中的那个人?
-Thanks for coming to see me. -You're the one I talked to on the phone?

2374
02:36:51,610 --> 02:36:56,010
瓦列霍警局  我是乔治・巴渥  我接手杰克・穆拉斯的案子
I'm George Bawart. Vallejo PD. I took over for Jack Mulanax.

2375
02:36:56,180 --> 02:36:59,150
都22年了  我不确定帮得上忙
It's been 22 years. I don't know how I can help you.

2376
02:36:59,320 --> 02:37:02,010
这是警方的正常程序  我要让你看一些照片
Well, this is just a formality. I'm gonna show you a group of photographs.

2377
02:37:02,190 --> 02:37:05,620
射伤你的人也许在这些人当中
Now, the person that shot you may or may not be among these photographs.

2378
02:37:06,360 --> 02:37:09,850
你不一定要指出任何人  懂吗?
You don't have to pick anybody out just because I'm showing you these pictures,you understand?

2379
02:37:10,030 --> 02:37:12,000
我懂  警官
Yes, sir, I do.

2380
02:37:12,160 --> 02:37:13,960
好吧
All right.

2381
02:37:14,570 --> 02:37:16,290
慢慢来
Take your time.

2382
02:37:16,530 --> 02:37:19,090
你认不出任何人也没关系
If you don't recognize anyone, that's okay.

2383
02:37:30,820 --> 02:37:32,480
是他
That's him.

2384
02:37:33,750 --> 02:37:35,410
你有多确定?
How sure are you?

2385
02:37:35,690 --> 02:37:37,350
非常确定
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

2386
02:37:40,420 --> 02:37:42,450
他像这家伙有张圆脸
He had a round face like this guy.

2387
02:37:42,630 --> 02:37:44,790
你又指认第二名嫌犯吗?
Wait. Am I to understand that you're now identifying the second photograph?

2388
02:37:44,960 --> 02:37:48,300
不  我只是说他也有一张圆脸
No, no. Just that he had a round face like that.

2389
02:37:49,900 --> 02:37:51,090
就是这个人
It's this man.

2390
02:37:52,140 --> 02:37:53,800
好吧
All right.

2391
02:37:55,370 --> 02:37:59,170
1到10分  10分是最确定
Now, on a scale of one to 10, 10 being positive,

2392
02:38:02,480 --> 02:38:04,410
你有多确定?
how sure are you?

2393
02:38:07,850 --> 02:38:09,510
至少有8分
At least an eight.

2394
02:38:12,290 --> 02:38:17,230
我最后一次看到这张脸  是1969年7月4日
The last time I saw this face was July 4th, 1969.

2395
02:38:19,430 --> 02:38:23,370
我很确定他是向我开枪的家伙
I am very sure that's the man who shot me.

2396
02:38:27,570 --> 02:38:30,540
麦克・梅休指认亚瑟・李・艾伦之后

2397
02:38:30,710 --> 02:38:34,240
警方安排了一次会议  打算以多重谋杀罪起诉他

2398
02:38:34,410 --> 02:38:37,850
艾伦在会议进行以前  因为心脏病发身亡

2399
02:38:39,150 --> 02:38:41,880
2002年  艾伦的DNA不符合

2400
02:38:42,050 --> 02:38:44,490
33年前黄道带信件采到的样本

2401
02:38:44,660 --> 02:38:46,820
旧金山及瓦列霍警方

2402
02:38:46,990 --> 02:38:50,150
拒绝根据DNA检验报告  排除艾伦的涉案嫌疑

2403
02:38:50,330 --> 02:38:52,490
2004年  旧金山警局

2404
