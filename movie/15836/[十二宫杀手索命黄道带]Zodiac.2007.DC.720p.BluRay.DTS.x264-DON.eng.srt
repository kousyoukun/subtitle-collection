1
00:01:06,126 --> 00:01:08,504
Where have you been?
I've been waiting since 7:00.

2
00:01:08,504 --> 00:01:10,924
Get in. I had to find fireworks.

3
00:01:10,924 --> 00:01:12,210
Let me drive.

4
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,504
Get in. I haven't eaten in 24 hours.

5
00:01:17,462 --> 00:01:19,042
Are you coming or not?

6
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,966
It's too crowded.

7
00:01:41,966 --> 00:01:43,798
I thought you were starving.

8
00:01:45,546 --> 00:01:47,756
Let's go someplace quiet.

9
00:01:49,252 --> 00:01:50,462
Okay.

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,672
What are we doing?

11
00:02:05,336 --> 00:02:09,588
Sitting. Listening to music. Talking.

12
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,462
-You seem weird. Is everything okay?
-Yeah, everything's fine.

13
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:25,126
It's July.
How many shirts are you wearing?

14
00:02:25,126 --> 00:02:28,252
-I'm cold.
-You're cold on the Fourth of July?

15
00:02:32,714 --> 00:02:34,798
Fuck off and die!

16
00:02:41,126 --> 00:02:44,252
-What?
-"Fuck off and die"?

17
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,084
Shut up.

18
00:03:12,462 --> 00:03:14,588
Was that car at the drive-in?

19
00:03:17,126 --> 00:03:19,252
I saw that car at Mr. Ed's.

20
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,966
-Do you want me to tell him to leave?
-Stay in the car.

21
00:03:44,252 --> 00:03:46,378
-Was that your husband?
-No.

22
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,462
Who was that, Darlene?

23
00:03:53,378 --> 00:03:55,588
Don't worry about it.

24
00:03:55,588 --> 00:03:59,042
-Don't tell me not to worry. Who was it?
-It's nothing.

25
00:04:18,714 --> 00:04:20,252
Oh, shit.

26
00:04:23,588 --> 00:04:24,840
Let's go.

27
00:04:28,378 --> 00:04:29,630
Now, D.

28
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,420
Get your wallet.

29
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:53,966
Man, you really creeped us out.

30
00:05:56,546 --> 00:05:59,336
<i>-Vallejo Police Department.</i>
<i>-I want to report a double murder.</i>

31
00:05:59,336 --> 00:06:01,042
<i>May I have your name</i>
<i>and where you are calling...</i>

32
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:03,504
<i>If you go one mile east</i>
<i>on Columbus Parkway,</i>

33
00:06:03,504 --> 00:06:06,798
<i>a public park,</i>
<i>you'll find kids in a brown car.</i>

34
00:06:07,672 --> 00:06:10,504
<i>They were shot with a 9mm Luger.</i>

35
00:06:11,462 --> 00:06:13,672
<i>I also killed those kids last year.</i>

36
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:16,882
<i>Goodbye.</i>

37
00:06:34,798 --> 00:06:35,924
Spit.

38
00:06:36,714 --> 00:06:38,588
Come on, buddy.

39
00:06:38,588 --> 00:06:41,672
-I swallowed it.
-Why?

40
00:06:41,672 --> 00:06:43,042
It was minty.

41
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:46,546
You can't do that. It's not good for you.

42
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,000
Lunch box.

43
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:52,000
-Why am I not going on the bus?
-Because we're late.

44
00:06:53,924 --> 00:06:57,294
Okay, you're staying
with your mom and Aaron tonight.

45
00:06:57,924 --> 00:07:00,210
So, you don't like
having a new little brother?

46
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,588
-No, not really.
-Oh, that's honest.

47
00:07:05,546 --> 00:07:07,420
Learn a lot.

48
00:07:10,756 --> 00:07:12,630
There will be a test tonight!

49
00:07:47,882 --> 00:07:49,000
Morning.

50
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:52,000
-Hi.
-Good morning.

51
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,378
-Morning.
-Morning.

52
00:08:14,546 --> 00:08:16,336
How's the coffee today, Shorty?

53
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,462
Editorial in two.

54
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,672
Good morning, gentlemen.

55
00:09:35,672 --> 00:09:37,000
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

56
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,042
Well, Stanton, tell Mr. Howe

57
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:41,546
the draft board piece
was damn near perfect.

58
00:09:42,714 --> 00:09:44,210
Mr. Graysmith.

59
00:09:45,756 --> 00:09:47,252
Horrid.

60
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:48,420
Horrid.

61
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,714
Not so horrid.

62
00:09:50,714 --> 00:09:52,504
Horrid.
I'm thinking we go with not so horrid.

63
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,966
Paul, what's on the crime beat?

64
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:03,168
Janice in Datebook left the fondue party
before everyone got naked.

65
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:05,000
That's a crime.

66
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,210
Have you seen her? Wouldn't kid you.

67
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,000
It may be the beginning of a crime wave.

68
00:10:10,504 --> 00:10:12,378
You need to see this.

69
00:10:17,756 --> 00:10:19,672
Go get the publisher.

70
00:10:19,672 --> 00:10:20,882
"Dear Editor,

71
00:10:20,882 --> 00:10:22,042

Would you read that, please?

"If you do not print this cipher

"until I end up with

96
00:11:34,756 --> 00:11:37,252
It's unsigned except for a symbol.

97
00:11:38,462 --> 00:11:41,630
Is it me,
or does that look like a gunsight?

98
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:45,126
Today's August first.

99
00:11:45,126 --> 00:11:46,840
He wants his code
in the afternoon edition.

100
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,672
If the Examiner doesn't have
the balls to run it, we scoop the Bay.

101
00:11:49,714 --> 00:11:51,840
Al, this man is talking about
shooting 12 people.

102
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,714
And not running this
might make him do that.

103
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,294
If we run it, we might be setting
a very dangerous precedent.

104
00:11:56,294 --> 00:11:57,840
Oh, come on, now, it's newsworthy.

105
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,168
Well, giving some sick bastard
a soapbox,

106
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:01,294
what does that say to people?

107
00:12:01,294 --> 00:12:04,588
Back up. Is this Vallejo story true?
Do we know that?

108
00:12:04,588 --> 00:12:07,588
-Paul?
-What? I cover crime in Vallejo?

109
00:12:08,798 --> 00:12:10,798
Yeah, I cover crime in Vallejo.
Ten minutes.

110
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:13,210
Let's shoot the code and call SFPD.

111
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:17,042
If it turns out to be real,
at least we'll have the material.

112
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:18,840
All right.

113
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,000
Graysmith,
don't you have that cartoon to finish?

114
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,252
Oh, yeah.

115
00:12:29,756 --> 00:12:32,084
Hi, this is Paul Avery
<i>from the San Francisco Chronicle.</i>

116
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:35,252
I'm looking for someone to
shed some light on a letter we received.

117
00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:36,294
Thank you.

118
00:12:37,546 --> 00:12:38,672
Sergeant Mulanax.

119
00:12:38,672 --> 00:12:40,546
<i>Sergeant, Paul Avery from</i>
the San Francisco Chronicle.

120
00:12:40,546 --> 00:12:41,672
I just wanted to check

121
00:12:41,672 --> 00:12:43,588
if you had an unsolved
firearm-related homicide

122
00:12:43,588 --> 00:12:46,588
on Christmas and
maybe one on July fourth.

123
00:12:46,588 --> 00:12:47,798
Shit.

124
00:12:48,294 --> 00:12:49,672
You guys got one, too?

125
00:12:50,714 --> 00:12:54,000
Confirmed.
VPD, they confirmed the shootings.

126
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,168
Al's on the phone with the Examiner

127
00:12:55,168 --> 00:12:56,672
They got the same letter
with a different code.

128
00:12:56,672 --> 00:12:57,840
<i>So did Times-Herald.</i>

129
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,294
Christmas, two teenagers
on lover's lane. Both DOA.

130
00:13:00,294 --> 00:13:02,000
David Faraday and Betty Jensen.

131
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,672
July fourth,
Darlene Ferrin and Michael...

132
00:13:04,672 --> 00:13:06,630
I think it's "Mayhew."
Anyway, he lived, she didn't.

133
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,798
The murder weapons?

134
00:13:07,798 --> 00:13:10,798
Ballistics, everything he said
in the letters matched.

135
00:13:10,798 --> 00:13:13,966
I mean, I think the Times-Herald's
gonna go with it.

136
00:13:13,966 --> 00:13:16,966
<i>The Examiner's going,</i>
but won't go front page.

137
00:13:16,966 --> 00:13:21,168
I say let's go front page.
If he kills 12 people, it's not our fault.

138
00:13:21,714 --> 00:13:24,294
Robert! We need the cartoon.

139
00:13:26,168 --> 00:13:29,462
-You're not finished?
-No, I'm finished, Carol. I'm finished.

140
00:13:29,462 --> 00:13:31,252
Thieriot's still here.

141
00:13:31,252 --> 00:13:32,462
Really?

142
00:13:32,882 --> 00:13:36,210
The first edition
is off the floor in 10 , Charles.

143
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,126
Give us a sec.

144
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:45,546
Okay, re-plate.

145
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,588
We'll go on page... Page four.

146
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,630
What do you say, 20 bucks
whoever cracks the psycho's name?

147
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,546
He won't give his name.

148
00:13:56,798 --> 00:13:58,630
Morti's? Anyone?

149
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,882
-That's where I'm heading.
-All right.

150
00:14:27,462 --> 00:14:30,252
Put those on my desk. Turn on the light.

151
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,756
Grab your book.

152
00:14:45,714 --> 00:14:47,798
Now go get your jammies on.

153
00:14:50,672 --> 00:14:52,210
<i>All right, people, listen up.</i>

154
00:14:52,588 --> 00:14:57,756
The cipher's broken into three sections,
each with eight lines and 17 symbols.

155
00:14:57,756 --> 00:15:00,378
No breaks between the symbols
denoting different words.

156
00:15:00,378 --> 00:15:02,840
No numbers or clues
to substitution keys.

157
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,966
And you got symbols
from at least seven different sources.

158
00:15:06,252 --> 00:15:10,924
Greek, Morse code, Navy semaphore,
weather symbols, astrological signs.

159
00:15:16,714 --> 00:15:19,924
-Hey, take a gander at this code thing.
-Okay.

160
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,840
You wanna give it a go?

161
00:15:28,882 --> 00:15:31,966
Guy who used to sit there
was a great cartoonist. Bob Bastian.

162
00:15:31,966 --> 00:15:35,294
Now he's doing public television.
For some reason.

163
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,210
Paul Avery.

164
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:42,630
Robert Graysmith.
I've been here nine months.

165
00:15:45,672 --> 00:15:48,042
You were right, by the way.
He didn't give his name.

166
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:49,084
Who cracked it?

167
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:51,420
A history teacher
and his wife in Salinas.

168
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,630
"I like killing people
because it is so much fun.

169
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:58,756
"It is more fun
than killing wild game in the forest

170
00:15:58,756 --> 00:16:03,420
"because man is the most
dangerous animal of all to kill.

171
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,168
"Something gives me
the most thrilling experience.

172
00:16:06,168 --> 00:16:10,252
"It is even better
than getting your rocks off with a girl.

173
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:14,000
"The best part of it is that when I die,

174
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,042
"I will be reborn in paradise.

175
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:20,546
"And all that I have killed
will become my slaves.

176
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:24,378
"I will not give you my name
because you will try to slow down

177
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,714
"or stop my collecting of slaves
for my afterlife."

178
00:16:27,714 --> 00:16:29,672
Methinks our friend's
a tad bit fuckered in the head.

179
00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:33,966
I heard he even sent Vallejo
a code key, just to help.

180
00:16:33,966 --> 00:16:36,420
-What is that at the bottom?
-Leftovers.

181
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,042
Maybe an anagram.

182
00:16:54,504 --> 00:16:56,966
How does one do that?

183
00:16:57,756 --> 00:16:59,966
I like puzzles. I do them a lot.

184
00:17:01,294 --> 00:17:04,378
How did you know
he wasn't gonna give his name?

185
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:06,588
Dangerous animal.

186
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,042
Dangerous animal.

187
00:17:09,966 --> 00:17:12,840
What dangerous animal?
How do I know that?

188
00:17:20,168 --> 00:17:21,882
-Paul.
-Yes, Templeton.

189
00:17:21,882 --> 00:17:24,000
-Editorial, now.
-Very well.

190
00:17:26,126 --> 00:17:27,798
Another letter.

191
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:31,126
More of the same.
Details about the murders.

192
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:36,252
He taped a flashlight to the gun.
That's how he hit them in the dark.

193
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:38,336
And he gave himself a name.

194
00:17:59,462 --> 00:18:02,672
You know this used to be
the town of Montecello?

195
00:18:02,672 --> 00:18:04,084
But at some point,

196
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:07,378
the county decided that the land
would work better as a lake.

197
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,084
So they flooded it.

198
00:18:10,546 --> 00:18:14,420
-But there's an entire...
-Hidden city under the water.

199
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,630
We were here last spring, remember?

200
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,042
Oh, yeah.

201
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,042
Somebody else is here.

202
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:27,840
It is a public park.

203
00:18:30,462 --> 00:18:32,672
I think he's watching us.

204
00:18:32,672 --> 00:18:34,924
Well, we're very good-looking.

205
00:18:40,588 --> 00:18:42,042
Where'd he go?

206
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,546
He went behind that tree.

207
00:18:46,546 --> 00:18:48,966
All right. So he's taking a leak.

208
00:18:55,924 --> 00:18:57,840
He's coming towards us.

209
00:18:59,882 --> 00:19:01,882
Oh, my God, he has a gun.

210
00:19:02,672 --> 00:19:04,210
Don't move.

211
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,126
-I want your money and your car keys.
-Okay.

212
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:09,504
We're not gonna do anything, okay?

213
00:19:09,504 --> 00:19:13,210
We're gonna cooperate.
Just tell me what you want us to do.

214
00:19:16,882 --> 00:19:17,966
Here.

215
00:19:20,294 --> 00:19:22,840
You're welcome to everything I have.

216
00:19:26,378 --> 00:19:28,924
If there's anything else
I could do for you...

217
00:19:28,924 --> 00:19:31,252
Maybe I could write you a check?

218
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:36,420
Okay, I could give you
my phone number.

219
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,798
You know, I might be able to help you.

220
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:42,000
Even more than you might think.

221
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,084
He's a sociology major.

222
00:19:45,588 --> 00:19:48,210
Pre-law, actually.

223
00:19:50,336 --> 00:19:51,924
Oh, keys.

224
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,126
You know, I'm sorry, I don't know exactly
where I put my keys.

225
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:57,126
They might be on the blanket.
Is it okay if...

226
00:20:01,882 --> 00:20:03,462
Here's the keys.

227
00:20:04,924 --> 00:20:06,840
Don't get up.

228
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,882
I want her to tie you up.

229
00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:14,168
Okay.

230
00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:37,000
You know, if he comes any closer,
I might be able to get that gun.

231
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,336
-Don't get any ideas.
-I'm not.

232
00:20:39,336 --> 00:20:42,000
I killed a guard
escaping from prison in Montana.

233
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,084
I'm not doing anything, okay?

234
00:20:44,084 --> 00:20:46,294
I'm not afraid to kill again.

235
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:49,126
Look away.

236
00:20:56,378 --> 00:20:58,756
What was the name of that prison?

237
00:21:02,546 --> 00:21:05,126
Hey, you said it was in Montatana, right?

238
00:21:06,252 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm taking your car.

239
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm going to Mexico.

240
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,168
We didn't complain
when you tied our hands.

241
00:21:12,168 --> 00:21:14,252
Okay, you have everything that I have.

242
00:21:14,252 --> 00:21:17,168
We have done everything
that you've asked.

243
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,630
It's okay. It's okay.

244
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,924
She tied you loose, didn't she?

245
00:21:24,084 --> 00:21:26,252
Get on your stomach
so I can tie your feet.

246
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:28,798
Okay.
It gets really cold out here at night.

247
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:30,378
We could freeze.

248
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,504
Okay, you all done?

249
00:21:42,504 --> 00:21:44,336
You know,
just because people are gonna ask,

250
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,420
was that thing even loaded?

251
00:21:57,378 --> 00:21:58,714
It's okay.

252
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,462
This is all gonna be okay.

253
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,168
<i>Dispatch, this is 43L2,</i>
<i>heading south on Knoxville Road.</i>

254
00:22:34,168 --> 00:22:37,924
<i>I’ve got an abandoned white</i>

<i>I want to report a murder.</i>
<i>No, a double murder.</i>

257

<i>They are two miles north</i>
<i>of park headquarters.</i>

258
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:06,630
<i>They were in a white</i>
<i>Volkswagen Karmann-Ghia.</i>

259
00:23:08,168 --> 00:23:10,336
<i>I’m the one that did it.</i>

260

<i>Piner's ambulance</i>
<i>has been dispatched.</i>

262
00:23:16,084 --> 00:23:18,336
Boy lived, the girl didn't. Again.

263
00:23:18,336 --> 00:23:20,798
God, can you imagine
surviving something like that?

264
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:22,294
Writing the dates on the side of the car.

265
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:25,504
We got two Vallejo killings,
now there's one in Napa. Why Napa?

266
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,504
What the hell is he doing out of Vallejo?

267
00:23:27,504 --> 00:23:31,084
Sweet mother of Christ,
what are you drawing?

268
00:23:31,084 --> 00:23:32,714
Kid at the lake.

269
00:23:32,714 --> 00:23:34,588
This is what he said
the Zodiac was wearing.

270
00:23:34,588 --> 00:23:35,924
God, that's a hell of a get-up.

271
00:23:35,924 --> 00:23:38,630
-Paul, what are you doing?
-Hyman, I wrote it. It's done.

272
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,798
Now I just got to type it up.

273
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:42,042
Type it up?
It's not finished until you type it up.

274
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:43,840
We've got to read it.

275
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,336
-What's that?
-That's the Zodiac at the lake.

276
00:23:49,336 --> 00:23:50,882
What's the story with the kid?

277
00:23:50,882 --> 00:23:53,336
He seems a little touched
or medicated or...

278
00:23:53,336 --> 00:23:54,588
-Graysmith?
-Yeah, what is it?

279
00:23:54,588 --> 00:23:56,168
He's a fucking boy scout.

280
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:58,504
He doesn't smoke,
he doesn't drink, he doesn't curse.

281
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:00,000
-And he's back.
-I knew it.

282
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,462
"Man is the most
dangerous animal of all."

283
00:24:01,462 --> 00:24:02,672
I knew that
I heard that from somewhere.

284
00:24:02,672 --> 00:24:05,042
<i>The Most Dangerous Game.</i>

285
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:08,126
It's a movie about a Count
who hunts people for sport.

286
00:24:08,126 --> 00:24:09,252
People.

287
00:24:09,252 --> 00:24:11,252
<i>The Most Dangerous Game.</i>

288
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,546
-Who's that?
-That's Count Zaroff.

289
00:24:14,546 --> 00:24:16,672
Zaroff? With a "Z"?

290
00:24:19,294 --> 00:24:21,126
<i>And that will be</i>
<i>all for the news on the 20.</i>

291
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,756
<i>We've got curfews in effect tonight</i>
<i>for the following counties,</i>

292
00:24:23,756 --> 00:24:27,798
<i>Napa, Solano, Contra Costa,</i>
<i>Alameda, Marin, and San Mateo.</i>

293
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:30,000
<i>So please, everyone, stay safe.</i>

294
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,420
<i>Vic in San Francisco, you're on the line.</i>
<i>You're not scared of the Zodiac?</i>

295
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:36,588
<i>Heck no,</i>
<i>he's only shooting those farm kids.</i>

296
00:24:36,588 --> 00:24:39,294
<i>What scares me</i>
<i>is those hippies out in the Haight</i>

297
00:24:39,294 --> 00:24:41,252
<i>with their free love and weird clothes.</i>

298
00:24:41,252 --> 00:24:43,378
<i>We've got Alfred from Vacaville.</i>

299
00:24:43,378 --> 00:24:45,756
<i>You know, I think</i>
<i>that was really offensive.</i>

300
00:24:45,756 --> 00:24:47,462
<i>It's not just farm kids.</i>

301
00:24:47,462 --> 00:24:49,420
<i>These are nice, clean-cut young people.</i>

302
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,966
<i>Hey, nobody's downplaying</i>
<i>the loss of human life here, Alfred.</i>

303
00:24:51,966 --> 00:24:54,084
<i>Well, that last guy was.</i>

304
00:24:54,084 --> 00:24:57,000
<i>We have good solid communities</i>
<i>out here in the North Bay.</i>

305
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,630
<i>Unlike in the city where you have</i>
<i>Satanists running around.</i>

306
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:04,210
<i>Well, you bring up a good question.</i>
<i>Is the Zodiac a Satanist?</i>

307
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,000
<i>Amber from Oakland,</i>
<i>what do you think?</i>

308
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,336
<i>I don't really know,</i>

309
00:25:07,336 --> 00:25:10,504
<i>but I thought that code</i>
<i>they printed didn't look very Christian.</i>

310
00:25:10,546 --> 00:25:13,336
<i>But I think the bigger problem</i>
<i>is that the papers shouldn't have printed</i>

311
00:25:13,336 --> 00:25:15,252
<i>anything that the Zodiac</i>
<i>has been doing.</i>

312
00:25:15,252 --> 00:25:18,504
<i>That they're just printing</i>
<i>all that stuff to sell more newspapers.</i>

313
00:25:18,504 --> 00:25:20,756
<i>Well, the Zodiac did demand</i>
<i>they print his letters</i>

314
00:25:20,756 --> 00:25:22,462
<i>or he'd kill more people.</i>

315
00:25:22,462 --> 00:25:23,882
<i>Yeah, but he would have</i>
<i>done it anyway,</i>

316
00:25:23,882 --> 00:25:25,546
<i>whether they printed it or not, I think.</i>

317
00:25:25,546 --> 00:25:27,084
<i>An interesting point.</i>

318
00:25:27,084 --> 00:25:29,252
<i>So, what do you think he'll do next?</i>

319
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:53,420
<i>-San Francisco Police Department.</i>
<i>-Yes. There's a fight in a cab!</i>

320
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,756
<i>What is your location?</i>

321
00:25:54,756 --> 00:25:57,840
<i>3398 Washington,</i>
<i>at the corner of Cherry.</i>

322
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,672
<i>One's drunk and</i>
<i>we think he's robbing him.</i>

323
00:25:59,672 --> 00:26:03,042
<i>-Is the crime still in progress?</i>
<i>-Yes, please hurry.</i>

324
00:26:04,504 --> 00:26:06,126
Oh, my God, look!

325
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,252
Nuts!

326
00:26:33,546 --> 00:26:35,462
Whoever this is,
you owe me a new lamp.

327
00:26:35,462 --> 00:26:38,168
<i>Cabbie's been shot</i>
<i>three blocks from the Presidio.</i>

328
00:26:38,168 --> 00:26:40,462
Well, it wasn't me.
I've been with my bride all night.

329
00:26:40,462 --> 00:26:43,546
-She can vouch.
-Go put on the Folgers.

330
00:26:43,546 --> 00:26:45,042
<i>You'll pick me up?</i>

331
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:46,924
Let me just describe
the lamp you're gonna buy me.

332
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:58,756
-I just got to sleep.
-Suspect's Negro, male adult.

333
00:26:58,756 --> 00:27:01,756
Walt's on scene, locked up the cab
and secured the crowd.

334
00:27:01,756 --> 00:27:04,378
Seriously, dead asleep.
I lost feeling in my arm and everything.

335
00:27:04,378 --> 00:27:05,714
Crackers.

336
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:11,630
You ever try Japanese food?

337
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,462
-What do you mean, like teriyaki?
-No, like the urchin.

338
00:27:14,462 --> 00:27:16,840
-Raw fish.
-I'm eating here, Bill.

339
00:27:18,168 --> 00:27:21,252
-I always wanted to try it.
-So, why don't you?

340
00:27:21,252 --> 00:27:23,252
Haven't got around to it.

341
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,084
Evening, gents. What a lovely night
for a botched robbery.

342
00:27:42,084 --> 00:27:44,756
Yeah, third this week.
Must be end of summer rush.

343
00:27:44,756 --> 00:27:47,966
I got foot patrols going through the park,
dogs are on the way.

344
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,378
The victim's name is Paul Stine.
Dousette pronounced him at 10:10.

345
00:27:52,378 --> 00:27:54,588
Suspect fired one shot
to the back of the head.

346
00:27:54,588 --> 00:27:56,588
Driver's wallet
and car keys are missing.

347
00:27:56,588 --> 00:27:57,714
How'd you know his name?

348
00:27:57,714 --> 00:28:00,756
Leroy, there, came down
from Yellow Cab to ID him.

349
00:28:00,756 --> 00:28:02,420
Neighborhood's pretty high-end
for this kind of thing,

350
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,714
so I already set up transpo for the cab.

351
00:28:04,756 --> 00:28:06,294
-Coroner's here.
-Any witnesses?

352
00:28:06,294 --> 00:28:09,840
Kids who called it in
saw the suspect from that window.

353
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,420
-Did they hear a shot?
-No.

354
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,630
They first saw him in the front seat,

355
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,630
thought he was a drunk
fighting with the driver.

356
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:17,714
Oldest kid ran downstairs to get
a better look from the dining room,

357
00:28:17,714 --> 00:28:19,630
described him as a white male, glasses,

358
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,924
crew-cut, stocky,
and wearing a dark jacket.

359
00:28:21,924 --> 00:28:23,840
Wait, I thought someone said
he was black.

360
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,840
That's the description
that went out to radio cars.

361
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,840
-We already corrected it.
-Oh, well, that's good.

362
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,336
-You guys need anything else?
-No. Get out of here.

363
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:33,378
Thanks. Happy Birthday.

364
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,168
-Wait, it's your birthday?
-Yep.

365
00:28:36,168 --> 00:28:38,378
-That's great. Happy birthday.
-Thanks.

366
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,504
-Body or scene?
-It's your birthday, I'll take the body.

367
00:28:41,504 --> 00:28:43,756
Dave, looks like he
wiped the cab down pretty good.

368
00:28:43,756 --> 00:28:46,252
-We got some blood over here.
-Prints?

369
00:28:46,252 --> 00:28:48,210
Could very well be.
We'll dust it at the Hall.

370
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:51,042
The odd thing is, we also got gloves.

371
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:53,462
-Suspect's?
-There's blood on them.

372
00:28:54,882 --> 00:28:56,168
-Hey, Pete?
-Yeah, Dave.

373
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:57,462
You through over there,
can I get in there?

374
00:28:57,462 --> 00:28:59,126
Yeah, I'm all set.

375
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:02,084
-Who rolled him?
-Stewarts.

376
00:29:08,966 --> 00:29:11,000
I got a single 9mm casing.

377
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,882
Yeah, Luger.

378
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,378
Nothing from the crowd.

379
00:29:19,378 --> 00:29:22,336
Okay.
I'm your shooter, Negro male adult,

380
00:29:22,336 --> 00:29:25,798
who also happens to be
a stocky, crew-cut Caucasian.

381
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:28,420
I flag a cab. I give him this address.

382
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,294
Did I give him this address?
Who's got the fare book?

383
00:29:31,294 --> 00:29:32,672
Right here.

384
00:29:34,966 --> 00:29:37,882
Washington and Maple.
That's one block east.

385
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:00,210
Lighting's the same over here,

386
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,756
so maybe I see
someone walking their dog.

387
00:30:02,756 --> 00:30:05,672
You don't want any witnesses
so you tell him to go down a block.

388
00:30:05,672 --> 00:30:06,840
He pulls over.

389
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,882
I wait for him to put it in park
because I'm smart

390
00:30:08,882 --> 00:30:10,294
and I don't want him
hitting the accelerator

391
00:30:10,294 --> 00:30:11,672
when I shoot him. May I?

392
00:30:11,672 --> 00:30:14,126
He stops, puts it in park, boom.

393
00:30:14,126 --> 00:30:16,924
I shoot him on the right side,
he slumps right?

394
00:30:16,924 --> 00:30:19,042
Maybe you've got your hand
on his collar when you shoot.

395
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:20,294
All right. So, either way,

396
00:30:20,294 --> 00:30:22,084
I just dumped a quart of blood
in the front seat.

397
00:30:22,084 --> 00:30:25,336
-So, why do you get in the front seat?
-For the money.

398
00:30:25,336 --> 00:30:26,462
But he's dead.

399
00:30:26,462 --> 00:30:28,294
You could just reach over the seat,
pull out his wallet.

400
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:30,546
You don't have to go
anywhere near the blood.

401
00:30:30,546 --> 00:30:33,042
So, why'd he get in the front seat?

402
00:30:33,546 --> 00:30:35,252
-I'm an idiot.
-But you're not an idiot.

403
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:37,084
You waited for him to put it in park.

404
00:30:37,084 --> 00:30:39,294
-Right. Thank you.
-Yeah, sure.

405
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,882
-Can I see that?
-Yeah.

406
00:30:43,378 --> 00:30:46,756
I am an idiot.
I just killed a man for $8.25.

407
00:30:46,756 --> 00:30:51,084
It's his third fare of the night.
Does anyone have any animal crackers?

408
00:30:51,588 --> 00:30:53,924
-Animal crackers?
-They're in the car.

409
00:30:53,924 --> 00:30:56,210
I'm saving those for later.

410
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,378
Fine.

411
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,630
-Are you a reporter?
-No, I'm Inspector Dave Toschi, SFPD.

412
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,294
Sir, I was wondering
if I'd be able to talk to your children,

413
00:31:08,294 --> 00:31:10,630
one at a time and preferably alone?

414
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:13,000
They just saw a man murdered.

415
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,126
I understand.

416
00:31:14,462 --> 00:31:16,210
It looked like
they were drunk and fighting.

417
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,630
Yeah, and he had a rag.

418
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:20,084
He came around the side of the car
and he was wiping stuff.

419
00:31:20,084 --> 00:31:23,546
-Did you get a chance to see his face?
-I did.

420
00:31:23,546 --> 00:31:25,042
Well, sort of.

421
00:31:26,336 --> 00:31:28,882
Did you remember what he looked like?

422
00:31:30,336 --> 00:31:32,420
-Normal.
-Yeah.

423
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,756
"Normal?"

424
00:31:56,462 --> 00:31:58,126
<i>"This is the Zodiac speaking.</i>

425
00:31:58,126 --> 00:32:00,588
<i>"I am the murderer of the taxi driver</i>

426
00:32:00,588 --> 00:32:04,126
"over by Washington Street
and Maple Street last night.

427
00:32:04,126 --> 00:32:06,672
"To prove this, here is
a blood-stained piece of his shirt.

428
00:32:06,672 --> 00:32:11,714
"I am the same man who did in
the people in the North Bay Area.

429
00:32:11,714 --> 00:32:14,378
"The S.F. Police could have
caught him last night

430
00:32:14,378 --> 00:32:16,000
"if they had searched the park properly

431
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,378
"instead of holding road races
with their motorcicles."

432
00:32:19,378 --> 00:32:21,000
-Gentlemen.
-Dave.

433
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,966
Paul. Where's the shirt?

434
00:32:24,378 --> 00:32:26,042
Right there, boss.

435
00:32:27,168 --> 00:32:28,840
There's your rag the kids talked about.

436
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,924
So he got in the front seat
to tear off a piece of the shirt.

437
00:32:30,924 --> 00:32:33,420
-Is this on the record?
-Well, what do you think?

438
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,588
He confirms
the Vallejo and Napa killings.

439
00:32:35,588 --> 00:32:37,252
Gets worse.

440
00:32:37,252 --> 00:32:39,378
Robert, do you have a deadline?

441
00:32:39,378 --> 00:32:41,630
What does he mean, it gets worse?

442
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,126
Read the last part.

443
00:32:43,126 --> 00:32:45,462
"School children make nice targets.

444
00:32:45,462 --> 00:32:47,840
"I think I shall wipe out
a school bus some morning.

445
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,630
"Just shoot out the front tire

446
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:52,126
"and then pick off the kiddies
as they come bouncing out."

447
00:32:52,126 --> 00:32:54,756
Jesus Christ, who's got school buses?
Department of Transportation?

448
00:32:54,756 --> 00:32:56,756
-School board.
-All right.

449
00:32:56,756 --> 00:32:59,126
I'm gonna need elimination prints
from your staff.

450
00:32:59,126 --> 00:33:01,882
Has anyone here
didn't touch this letter?

451
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,378
On my way back to my desk.
They have phones, if you want.

452
00:33:08,378 --> 00:33:10,084
We need to get matches
on blood and fabric.

453
00:33:10,084 --> 00:33:11,336
I'll call Napa and Vallejo,

454
00:33:11,336 --> 00:33:13,252
get the letters up to Sherwood
in Sacramento.

455
00:33:13,252 --> 00:33:16,756
Dave, just one thing.
Is it true they got a print off the cab?

456
00:33:16,756 --> 00:33:19,126
Yeah, we got a partial in blood.

457
00:33:19,966 --> 00:33:23,168
-But that is not for publication.
-Hey, hey, come on.

458
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,504
Hey, it's me.

459
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,630
Did he say they got a print?

460
00:33:28,714 --> 00:33:29,966
Partial.

461
00:33:30,924 --> 00:33:32,000
Whoa.

462
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:34,840
Dude, he wears his gun like Bullitt.

463
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,420
No, McQueen got that from Toschi.

464
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,294
Does he think that Zodiac's
gonna send another code?

465
00:33:39,294 --> 00:33:41,210
'Cause I think Zodiac's
gonna send another code.

466
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,336
Jesus Harold Christ
on rubber crutches, Bobby.

467
00:33:43,336 --> 00:33:44,462
What are you doing?

468
00:33:44,462 --> 00:33:45,882
You're doing that thing,
the thing we discussed,

469
00:33:45,882 --> 00:33:48,462
the thing that I don't like.
Starts with an "L."

470
00:33:48,462 --> 00:33:50,462
-Oh, looming.
-Yeah.

471
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:53,462
In cooperation with SFPD ,
we will run the Zodiac letter

472
00:33:53,462 --> 00:33:56,252
without including the threat
on school children.

473
00:33:56,252 --> 00:33:58,000
We don't want to start a city-wide panic

474
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,630
so I'm asking all of you
to please keep this confidential.

475
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,924
Just go about your daily business.

476
00:34:03,924 --> 00:34:05,294
Thank you.

477
00:34:20,966 --> 00:34:24,084
I packed you your carrots
and your soda and peanut butter, okay?

478
00:34:24,084 --> 00:34:27,084
-Dad, you don't have to wait with me.
-I know.

479
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:38,252
You know what? You know what?
I'm gonna drive him today, okay?

480
00:34:38,714 --> 00:34:39,966
Come on.

481
00:34:57,966 --> 00:34:59,756
What's that?

482
00:34:59,756 --> 00:35:02,294
Similarities in the lowercase "r's."

483
00:35:11,462 --> 00:35:12,714
And that?

484
00:35:12,714 --> 00:35:14,756
It is you waiting in the hall
if you speak again.

485
00:35:14,756 --> 00:35:16,630
I have to concentrate.

486
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,210
Sorry.

487
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:20,378
"Sorry" counts as speaking.

488
00:35:31,084 --> 00:35:34,084
There are similarities
in the lowercase "r's."

489
00:35:38,126 --> 00:35:40,588
We have to release the bus threat.

490
00:35:41,168 --> 00:35:43,882
-It'll screw us.
-We're already screwed.

491
00:35:43,882 --> 00:35:46,210
We just went from
"Routine Cabbie Shooting"

492
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,420
to "Mass Murderer Targets Kids."

493
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:59,378
<i>The Zodiac Killer</i>
<i>has come to San Francisco.</i>

494
00:35:59,378 --> 00:36:00,462
<i>Confirmation tonight,</i>

495
00:36:00,462 --> 00:36:02,504
<i>from the San Francisco</i>
<i>Police Department</i>

496
00:36:02,504 --> 00:36:04,546
<i>that in his latest haunting letter,</i>

497
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:07,840
<i>which takes credit for the murder</i>
<i>of cab driver Paul Stine,</i>

498
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,336
<i>the Zodiac has threatened to,</i>
<i>"Wipe out a school bus</i>

499
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:14,672
<i>"and pick off the kiddies</i>
<i>as they come bouncing out."</i>

500
00:36:18,126 --> 00:36:20,882
<i>If you think you might know</i>
<i>who the Zodiac is,</i>

501
00:36:20,882 --> 00:36:25,042
<i>you can call the San Francisco</i>
<i>Police Department's newest tip line.</i>

502
00:36:48,168 --> 00:36:51,546
Press conference is at 4:00.
We got to give them something.

503
00:36:51,546 --> 00:36:53,042
We're coordinating
with the school board,

504
00:36:53,042 --> 00:36:55,042
and we expect
a break in the case very soon.

505
00:36:55,042 --> 00:36:56,882
-What do we really got?
-We're swamped.

506
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,378
When they can't get anyone
on the tip line

507
00:36:58,378 --> 00:37:00,168
they call the switchboard
and keep getting put through.

508
00:37:00,168 --> 00:37:01,252
You got any hard suspects?

509
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:04,084
About 90 an hour. I'm up to around 500.

510
00:37:04,084 --> 00:37:05,294
Well, can't you narrow it down?

511
00:37:05,294 --> 00:37:07,546
I would love to,
if I could get out of this...

512
00:37:07,546 --> 00:37:11,126
-Homicide, please hold.
-Yeah, hold, please.

513
00:37:11,126 --> 00:37:12,966
We're gonna need to tell them
we got the entire force on this.

514
00:37:12,966 --> 00:37:14,336
How many men can you give me?

515
00:37:14,336 --> 00:37:16,462
Well, right now, it's you and Bill
and Monday's a school day.

516
00:37:16,462 --> 00:37:18,462
Yeah, I know, Chief.
I have three daughters of my own.

517
00:37:18,462 --> 00:37:20,504
Yeah, I know. Where's Armstrong?

518
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:22,042
He's on the phone with Vallejo.

519
00:37:22,042 --> 00:37:24,084
We're playing catch up, Jack.

520
00:37:24,084 --> 00:37:26,714
I'd like to set up a meeting
with your survivor, Michael Mageau.

521
00:37:26,714 --> 00:37:28,378
I can't. He skipped town.

522
00:37:28,378 --> 00:37:31,126
The only guy who's seen Zodiac
without a mask is missing?

523
00:37:31,126 --> 00:37:34,378
When he was still in the hospital
we could show him lineups all day long.

524
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:35,882
As soon as he got out, he split.

525
00:37:35,882 --> 00:37:37,000
<i>Really? Why?</i>

526
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,294
I don't think he wanted
to have anything to do with this.

527
00:37:39,294 --> 00:37:41,588
<i>Can you send us everything</i>
<i>that you have?</i>

528
00:37:41,588 --> 00:37:44,420
Well, the road goes both ways.

529
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,630
Now, we need that print
you lifted from the cab

530
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,672
<i>and we should have been in</i>
<i>on the handwriting.</i>

531
00:37:49,672 --> 00:37:52,042
I apologize.
Things have been moving fast.

532
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:54,882
<i>Who should I talk to in Napa</i>
<i>so we can coordinate?</i>

533
00:37:54,882 --> 00:37:56,126
Talk to Ken Narlow.

534
00:37:56,126 --> 00:37:58,084
We really should have been in
on the handwriting.

535
00:37:58,084 --> 00:38:00,672
<i>I apologize.</i>
<i>Things have been moving fast.</i>

536
00:38:00,672 --> 00:38:02,210
<i>Listen, we're gonna need</i>
<i>your scene photos.</i>

537
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,336
Can't help you.

538
00:38:03,336 --> 00:38:05,378
<i>Ken, I don't want to get into</i>
<i>a jurisdictional thing here.</i>

539
00:38:05,378 --> 00:38:08,084
No, no, no, no, no.
We didn't have a crime scene.

540
00:38:08,084 --> 00:38:11,420
The ranger that found the kids literally
swept everything into a picnic blanket.

541
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,210
<i>All we have are the Wing Walker prints.</i>

542
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,420
The what?

543
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,210
Boot prints to and from the crime scene

544
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,966
were made by size
10-and-a-half Wing Walkers,

545
00:38:17,966 --> 00:38:21,420
military-style boots
sold only at military PXs

546
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,798
designed to walk
on the wings of planes.

547
00:38:23,798 --> 00:38:26,630
<i>And you can't buy at a PX</i>
<i>without a military ID,</i>

548
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,672
so our suspect could be military.

549
00:38:28,672 --> 00:38:30,504
Did you guys narrow your list off of this?

550
00:38:30,546 --> 00:38:32,714
-Yeah.
<i>-Did Vallejo?</i>

551
00:38:32,714 --> 00:38:34,924
I don't know. I don't work in Vallejo.
I work here.

552
00:38:34,924 --> 00:38:37,168
Great. I'm gonna need photos
of those boot prints.

553
00:38:37,168 --> 00:38:39,210
<i>Sure, if you send me the handwriting.</i>

554
00:38:39,252 --> 00:38:40,924
I thought Questioned Documents
already did.

555
00:38:40,924 --> 00:38:42,546
Nope. Vallejo's got them, not us.

556
00:38:42,546 --> 00:38:44,630
All right.
I'll have Questioned Documents...

557
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,630
Forget it. I'll telefax it to you.

558
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,210
We don't have telefax yet.

559
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:50,924
-Okay, I'll put it in the mail.
<i>-We'll mail ours, too.</i>

560
00:38:50,924 --> 00:38:52,672
And call Mulanax in Vallejo.

561
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,882
-Maybe he can get you a mimeo.
-Right.

562
00:38:54,882 --> 00:38:57,336
Why don't you just get a photo
off the original plaster cast?

563
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:59,546
We'd have to wait,
because they don't have a fax.

564
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:01,084
<i>We don't have a fax, either.</i>

565
00:39:01,084 --> 00:39:02,924
Look, I'm just trying
to get us coordinated.

566
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:04,504
Have you called Solano Sheriff's Office?

567
00:39:04,504 --> 00:39:06,210
Why would I call Solano?

568
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,924
<i>Because the two kids that got killed</i>
<i>last Christmas were Solano's.</i>

569
00:39:09,924 --> 00:39:11,210
I thought they were Vallejo.

570
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,630
No, they were over the county line

571
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,924
so you're gonna need
to coordinate with them, too.

572
00:39:14,924 --> 00:39:16,462
Okay.

573
00:39:16,462 --> 00:39:17,588
Bill.

574
00:39:18,252 --> 00:39:20,168
Can I have a word with you?

575
00:39:23,084 --> 00:39:25,210
Where did you see this guy?

576
00:39:25,966 --> 00:39:28,504
We got the call to circle the scene
and look for a Negro male adult.

577
00:39:28,504 --> 00:39:30,084
Where was he?

578
00:39:30,084 --> 00:39:32,630
On Jackson. Heading east.
About the middle of the block.

579
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,756
And this is three minutes
after the shooting?

580
00:39:34,756 --> 00:39:36,000
Give or take. Yeah.

581
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,378
-And you were heading east or west?
-We were going west.

582
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:40,714
All right, so you're
on Jackson going west.

583
00:39:40,714 --> 00:39:43,924
So the cab was one block
catty-corner southwest?

584
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:45,714
-Correct.
-Did you slow down?

585
00:39:45,714 --> 00:39:47,546
-Of course we slowed down.
-All right.

586
00:39:47,546 --> 00:39:49,882
Listen, Dispatch said
it was a Negro male.

587
00:39:49,882 --> 00:39:51,252
That was corrected.

588
00:39:51,252 --> 00:39:54,000
No, but at the time
they hadn't changed it.

589
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,168
This guy was white.

590
00:39:56,168 --> 00:39:58,126
Right, not in a hurry.
Kind of lumbering along like...

591
00:39:58,126 --> 00:40:00,966
Lumbering?
What do you mean, "lumbering"?

592
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,756
-Shuffling.
-Stocky? Had a crew cut?

593
00:40:05,672 --> 00:40:08,000
Yeah, that's all correct.

594
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,798
Listen, it was dark.

595
00:40:10,672 --> 00:40:12,840
The guy was wearing a dark jacket.
There's no way...

596
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,336
He would have been covered in blood.

597
00:40:16,924 --> 00:40:18,546
Did you stop him?

598
00:40:20,588 --> 00:40:22,378
Did you talk to him?

599
00:40:22,966 --> 00:40:24,924
-Yes? No?
-No.

600
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,420
You need to get with a sketch artist.

601
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,420
We have to put out
a new composite right away.

602
00:40:33,504 --> 00:40:36,546
<i>Five persons have been murdered</i>
<i>in the San Francisco area,</i>

603
00:40:36,546 --> 00:40:38,042
<i>and in each case the killer...</i>

604
00:40:38,042 --> 00:40:40,672
<i>"I shall wipe out a school bus</i>
<i>some morning..."</i>

605
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:42,294
<i>San Francisco police...</i>

606
00:40:44,168 --> 00:40:46,714
<i>...to see the Stones in concert</i>
<i>this Sunday.</i>

607
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,168
<i>The new letters</i>
<i>from the Zodiac Killer were sent to</i>

608
00:40:49,168 --> 00:40:51,294
<i>the City room of the</i>
San Francisco Chronicle.

609
00:40:51,294 --> 00:40:52,546
<i>One of the letters was...</i>

610
00:40:52,546 --> 00:40:55,210
Looming. No looming.

611
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:58,420
-Have you considered the water theory?
-What?

612
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,336
Geographically, every attack
takes place near a body of water

613
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:02,588
-or a water-based name.
-This is your water theory?

614
00:41:02,588 --> 00:41:05,126
Lake Berryessa. Blue Rock Springs.

615
00:41:05,126 --> 00:41:07,798
-Lake Herman.
-Wash-ington and Cherry?

616
00:41:09,252 --> 00:41:10,966
You think?

617
00:41:10,966 --> 00:41:12,084
No.

618
00:41:12,084 --> 00:41:13,588
I'm reading this book,

619
00:41:13,588 --> 00:41:15,336
<i>Homicide Investigation</i>
by Lemoyne Snyder...

620
00:41:15,336 --> 00:41:16,840
-"Leymone."
-...and he says you look for patterns,

621
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,042
-so I'm looking for patterns.
-No.

622
00:41:19,042 --> 00:41:21,462
You can't think of this case
in normal police terms.

623
00:41:21,462 --> 00:41:23,714
-Why not?
-You got four crime scenes.

624
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:26,756
Solano, Vallejo, Berryessa, and here.

625
00:41:26,756 --> 00:41:30,462
Not a single usable print
at the first three or in any of the letters?

626
00:41:30,924 --> 00:41:34,462
How does our master criminal come
to the city and leave a bloody latent?

627
00:41:34,462 --> 00:41:37,126
I mean, assuming the gloves are his,

628
00:41:37,126 --> 00:41:38,966
he shoots the cabbie
and then takes them off?

629
00:41:38,966 --> 00:41:40,210
<i>So it's not his print?</i>

630
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:42,084
Maybe, maybe not.
You're missing the point.

631
00:41:42,084 --> 00:41:44,798
-The point is the first attack...
-David Faraday and Betty Jensen.

632
00:41:44,798 --> 00:41:46,462
They both die.

633
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,000
From there on out,
he only manages to kill the girls.

634
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,042
-Not for lack of trying.
-Not for lack of trying.

635
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:54,714
Mageau lives, Ferrin dies.
Hartnell lives, Shepard dies.

636
00:41:54,714 --> 00:41:58,168
He gets so caught up with the women
he forgets to finish off the men.

637
00:41:58,168 --> 00:42:00,588
Plus, they're all couples
and all on lover's lanes.

638
00:42:00,588 --> 00:42:02,546
-Paul Stine is not.
-Exactly.

639
00:42:02,546 --> 00:42:04,840
Single, male cab driver
on Washington and Cherry doesn't fit.

640
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,252
Doesn't fit.

641
00:42:07,126 --> 00:42:09,420
So, why does Zodiac kill him?

642
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:14,252
He's breaking the pattern.

643
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,546
Yeah?

644
00:42:24,546 --> 00:42:28,378
<i>Someone claiming to be Zodiac</i>
<i>called Oakland PD a half-hour ago.</i>

645
00:42:28,378 --> 00:42:31,714
<i>He says he's gonna call in on Jim</i>
<i>Dunbar's morning show in three hours.</i>

646
00:42:31,714 --> 00:42:32,882
On television?

647
00:42:32,924 --> 00:42:35,084
<i>He wants Melvin Belli on</i>
<i>to counsel him.</i>

648
00:42:35,084 --> 00:42:37,210
All right. All right.
Let's go wake up Melvin.

649
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,630
Animal crackers?

650
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:43,000
Glove box.

651
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,798
Are these windows bulletproof?

652
00:42:44,798 --> 00:42:47,462
Yes, Melvin.
You don't have to lie down back there.

653
00:42:47,462 --> 00:42:48,756
This man is a marksman,

654
00:42:48,756 --> 00:42:51,672
could snuff me out
at a moment's notice.

655
00:42:51,672 --> 00:42:53,168
Are you sure you're up for this?

656
00:42:53,168 --> 00:42:57,672
Don't you worry about me, Inspector.
I'll be fine when the lights are on.

657
00:42:57,672 --> 00:42:59,546
This man has asked for my help.

658
00:42:59,546 --> 00:43:01,714
The man you're worrying about
snuffing you out?

659
00:43:01,714 --> 00:43:03,672
What are these, cookies?

660
00:43:05,336 --> 00:43:07,462
Dear Lord, do you ever clean this car?

661
00:43:07,756 --> 00:43:11,210
-Shit.
-KGO must have tipped other stations.

662
00:43:20,756 --> 00:43:23,798
<i>Get him talking.</i>
<i>Convince him to meet you somewhere.</i>

663
00:43:23,798 --> 00:43:25,168
If you see an opportunity,

664
00:43:25,168 --> 00:43:28,000
we want you to suggest
Old St. Mary's Church in Chinatown.

665
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,294
You'll be tracing the call?

666
00:43:29,294 --> 00:43:32,504
Pacific Telephone says you need to
keep him on the line for 15 minutes.

667
00:43:32,504 --> 00:43:34,756
We can do that, can't we, Jim?

668
00:43:37,084 --> 00:43:39,462
Fifteen seconds. Clear the set.

669
00:43:45,798 --> 00:43:48,126
Here you go, you drunken reprobate.

670
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:52,000
<i>We interrupt our regular program</i>
<i>to bring you this news bulletin.</i>

671
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,084
<i>Welcome to this special edition</i>
<i>of our show</i>

672
00:43:54,084 --> 00:43:56,042
<i>in which we are joined</i>
<i>by attorney Melvin Belli</i>

673
00:43:56,042 --> 00:43:59,504
<i>who the Zodiac Killer</i>
<i>personally requested to appear.</i>

674
00:43:59,504 --> 00:44:01,462
Finish up, buddy, and put it in the sink.

675
00:44:01,462 --> 00:44:04,546
<i>-Good morning, Melvin.</i>
<i>-Good morning, Jim.</i>

676
00:44:04,546 --> 00:44:07,882
<i>So, the phone lines are open.</i>
<i>Mr. Belli is here.</i>

677
00:44:07,882 --> 00:44:09,042
<i>Here to help, Jim.</i>

678
00:44:09,042 --> 00:44:10,966
<i>Yes. Here to help.</i>

679
00:44:10,966 --> 00:44:15,714
<i>And we ask the public not to call in,</i>
<i>so that the Zodiac himself can reach us.</i>

680
00:44:24,756 --> 00:44:28,252
I saw your Star Trek, by the way.
It was excellent.

681
00:44:28,252 --> 00:44:30,294
A shame about the show.

682
00:44:30,294 --> 00:44:31,840
Good people.

683
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,672
You know, I've often thought of
becoming an actor full-time.

684
00:44:35,672 --> 00:44:37,042
What was your character's name?

685
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:39,294
<i>-Gorgon.</i>
<i>-Gorgon. That's right.</i>

686
00:44:40,798 --> 00:44:42,798
Roll the tape. Get the tape.

687
00:44:42,798 --> 00:44:45,462
Jim, we have a call. We're going live.

688
00:44:46,714 --> 00:44:47,924
Hello?

689
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,630
Hello? This is Melvin Belli.

690
00:44:54,798 --> 00:44:56,966
Who am I speaking with?

691
00:44:56,966 --> 00:44:59,378
<i>This is the Zodiac speaking.</i>

692
00:45:02,504 --> 00:45:06,378
Is there something I can call you
that's a little less ominous?

693
00:45:08,336 --> 00:45:09,420
<i>Sam.</i>

694
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,966
Sam.

695
00:45:12,294 --> 00:45:15,966
Is there somewhere we can meet, Sam,
and talk about this?

696
00:45:16,378 --> 00:45:19,714
<i>Meet me on top of the Fairmont Hotel.</i>

697
00:45:19,756 --> 00:45:21,588
<i>Without anyone else or I’ll jump...</i>

698
00:45:21,588 --> 00:45:23,504
Have a unit go to the Fairmont Hotel.

699
00:45:23,504 --> 00:45:25,756
<i>-Sam.</i>
-Yes?

700
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,966
Do you think you need medical care?

701
00:45:29,966 --> 00:45:31,966
<i>Medical, not mental.</i>

702
00:45:31,966 --> 00:45:34,336
Do you have health problems?

703
00:45:34,336 --> 00:45:36,168
<i>I’m sick. I have headaches.</i>

704
00:45:36,168 --> 00:45:38,000
Headaches?

705
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,462
I have headaches, too,

706
00:45:39,462 --> 00:45:42,252
but a chiropractor stopped them
a week ago.

707
00:45:42,252 --> 00:45:44,084
I think I can help you, Sam.

708
00:45:46,504 --> 00:45:47,798
Sam?

709
00:45:49,714 --> 00:45:52,168
He knows they're tracing his calls.

710
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:59,966
<i>Sam, we'd like you to know</i>
<i>that we are not tracing these calls.</i>

711
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:04,252
<i>It's a long, difficult process</i>
<i>and ineffective with these short calls.</i>

712
00:46:09,714 --> 00:46:10,798
Sam?

713
00:46:13,042 --> 00:46:16,168
We're not tracing these calls.
You have my word.

714
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:18,252
<i>Okay.</i>

715
00:46:18,714 --> 00:46:22,084
<i>Sam, you need to tell me</i>
<i>what your problem is.</i>

716
00:46:22,084 --> 00:46:24,042
<i>I don't want to go to the gas chamber.</i>

717
00:46:24,042 --> 00:46:26,672
<i>I have headaches.</i>
<i>I kill, I don't get them.</i>

718
00:46:26,672 --> 00:46:28,084
That is fucked up!

719
00:46:28,084 --> 00:46:31,672
<i>You want to live, don't you?</i>
<i>Well, this is your passport.</i>

720
00:46:31,672 --> 00:46:33,168
<i>How long have you been</i>
<i>having these headaches?</i>

721
00:46:33,168 --> 00:46:35,210
<i>Since I killed a kid.</i>

722
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:38,462
-Do you have blackouts?
<i>-Yes.</i>

723
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:42,294
-Do you have fits?
<i>-No. I just have headaches.</i>

724
00:46:42,294 --> 00:46:44,000
Did you attempt to call one other time

725
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,672
when F. Lee Bailey was with us
two or three weeks ago?

726
00:46:46,672 --> 00:46:47,798
<i>Yes.</i>

727
00:46:47,798 --> 00:46:49,714
And why did you want
to talk to Mr. Bailey?

728
00:46:49,714 --> 00:46:52,756
Why do you wanna tal k to me, Sam?

729
00:46:52,756 --> 00:46:54,504
<i>-I don't want to be hurt.</i>
-Why is he calling?

730
00:46:54,504 --> 00:46:56,546
-Hey, just a second, buddy.
<i>-I don't wanna go to the gas chamber.</i>

731
00:46:56,546 --> 00:46:58,336
<i>You won't get hurt if you talk to me.</i>

732
00:46:58,336 --> 00:47:01,420
And you're not going
to the gas chamber.

733
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:03,924
I wouldn't think they would ask
for capital punishment.

734
00:47:03,924 --> 00:47:06,168
<i>We should ask the District Attorney.</i>

735
00:47:06,168 --> 00:47:08,336
<i>Do you want me to do that, Sam?</i>

736
00:47:08,336 --> 00:47:11,084
<i>Do you want me to talk</i>
<i>to the District Attorney?</i>

737
00:47:14,966 --> 00:47:16,714
What was that, Sam?

738
00:47:17,672 --> 00:47:19,840
<i>I did not say anything.</i>

739
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,798
<i>We heard a scream.</i>

740
00:47:22,546 --> 00:47:24,714
<i>That was my headache.</i>

741
00:47:25,504 --> 00:47:28,504
You sound like you're in
a great deal of pain.

742
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:32,294
<i>My head aches. I’m so sick.</i>

743
00:47:34,126 --> 00:47:35,756
<i>I’m gonna kill them.</i>

744
00:47:35,756 --> 00:47:38,672
-Oh, okay.
<i>-I’m gonna kill those kids!</i>

745
00:47:38,672 --> 00:47:40,294
Fantastic.

746
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,294
<i>Sam?</i>

747
00:47:45,798 --> 00:47:50,126
<i>-Let's meet and talk. Just us.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

748
00:47:50,168 --> 00:47:52,924
<i>How about Old St. Mary's Church</i>
<i>in Chinatown?</i>

749
00:47:52,924 --> 00:47:54,336
<i>No.</i>

750
00:47:54,336 --> 00:47:58,294
<i>In front of the Daly City</i>
<i>St. Vincent de Paul at 10:30.</i>

751
00:47:58,294 --> 00:48:00,042
I'll see you there.

752
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:03,756
Take care of yourself, Sam.

753
00:48:28,042 --> 00:48:29,336
My, my, my.

754
00:48:29,336 --> 00:48:33,084
You fellows certainly know
how to put on a secret meeting.

755
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:37,042
<i>You know, the problem is,</i>

756
00:48:37,042 --> 00:48:39,966
<i>I don't want to go to the gas chamber.</i>
<i>I have headaches.</i>

757
00:48:39,966 --> 00:48:42,084
<i>I kill, I don't get them.</i>

758
00:48:42,084 --> 00:48:43,756
No, it's not him.

759
00:48:44,798 --> 00:48:48,042
It's the voice.
The voice is too high. It's too young.

760
00:48:48,042 --> 00:48:50,378
All right.
Thanks for coming down, Bryan.

761
00:48:50,378 --> 00:48:51,756
<i>Do you have blackouts?</i>

762
00:48:51,756 --> 00:48:53,630
That's okay. I got it.

763
00:48:59,798 --> 00:49:00,924
They pulled off the trace.

764
00:49:00,924 --> 00:49:04,294
Our Daly City no-show
called from a mental institution.

765
00:49:04,294 --> 00:49:06,252
Oakland PD's operator is sure

766
00:49:06,252 --> 00:49:08,840
the man she talked to
had a deeper voice.

767
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,000
Calmer.

768
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,042
Might have actually been him.

769
00:49:19,336 --> 00:49:22,630
"So I shall change
my way of collecting slaves.

770
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:26,210
"I shall no longer announce to anyone
when I commit my murders.

771
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:29,504
"They shall look like routine robberies,
killings of anger

772
00:49:29,504 --> 00:49:32,588
"and a few fake accidents, et cetera.

773
00:49:32,588 --> 00:49:33,756
"The police shall never catch me

774
00:49:33,756 --> 00:49:36,252
"because I have been
too clever for them.

775
00:49:36,252 --> 00:49:39,882
"I look like the description passed out
only when I do my thing.

776
00:49:39,882 --> 00:49:43,042
"The rest of the time
I look entirely different.

777
00:49:43,042 --> 00:49:47,546
"I shall not tell you what
my disguise consists of when I kill.

778
00:49:48,126 --> 00:49:50,756
"As of yet I have left no
fingerprints behind me,

779
00:49:50,756 --> 00:49:53,378
"contrary to what the police say.

780
00:49:53,378 --> 00:49:55,756
"I wear transparent fingertips.

781
00:49:56,714 --> 00:50:01,546
"All it is is two coats of airplane cement
coated on my fingertips.

782
00:50:01,546 --> 00:50:06,126
"I enjoy needling the blue pigs.
Hey, blue pig, I was in the park.

783
00:50:06,126 --> 00:50:11,672
"You were using fire trucks to mask
the sound of your cruising prowl cars.

784
00:50:11,714 --> 00:50:13,210
"Hey, pig, doesn't it rile you up

785
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:16,420
"to have your nose
rubbed in your booboos?

786
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:19,588
"If you cops think I am going to take
on a bus the way I stated I was,

787
00:50:19,588 --> 00:50:22,840
"you deserve to have holes
in your heads."

788
00:50:24,756 --> 00:50:26,966
And you need to look at this.

789
00:50:29,798 --> 00:50:32,294
"Take one bag of
ammonium nitrate fertilizer,

790
00:50:32,294 --> 00:50:34,042
"one gallon of stove oil,

791
00:50:34,042 --> 00:50:36,294
"and dump a few bags
of gravel on top..."

792
00:50:36,294 --> 00:50:38,126
-Okay.
-It's a bomb.

793
00:50:38,126 --> 00:50:40,000
Okay. We gotta call the Army
and see if this

794
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,840
science experiment could actually work.

795
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,378
Another cipher.

796
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:49,378
-When did these arrive?
-They arrived this morning.

797
00:50:49,378 --> 00:50:50,882
Are you planning to publish?

798
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:52,084
Robert.

799
00:50:53,588 --> 00:50:55,546
We should have a drink.

800
00:50:59,672 --> 00:51:01,084
Thank you.

801
00:51:02,882 --> 00:51:05,210
So, tell me about yourself.

802
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:08,756
-You married?
-Divorced. Two kids.

803
00:51:09,756 --> 00:51:11,672
What do you do for fun?

804
00:51:13,168 --> 00:51:14,798
I love to read.

805
00:51:15,714 --> 00:51:18,294
-I enjoy books.
-Those are the same things.

806
00:51:18,294 --> 00:51:20,840
Why you been going through my trash?

807
00:51:23,672 --> 00:51:25,546
I'll come back to that.

808
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:27,840
How did you know
he was gonna send another code?

809
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,672
I just guessed.

810
00:51:29,672 --> 00:51:31,924
-Just guessed.
-The first one seemed too easy.

811
00:51:31,924 --> 00:51:34,378
All right, this can no longer be ignored.

812
00:51:34,378 --> 00:51:38,084
-What is that you're drinking?
-It's an Aqua Velva.

813
00:51:38,084 --> 00:51:41,000
You wouldn't make fun of it
if you tried it.

814
00:51:50,504 --> 00:51:52,924
But who actually cracked the code?

815
00:51:53,714 --> 00:51:56,042
A married couple who like puzzles.

816
00:51:56,042 --> 00:51:58,294
So what's that tell us about the Zodiac?

817
00:51:58,294 --> 00:51:59,714
-He's no expert.
-Right.

818
00:51:59,714 --> 00:52:01,462
It's just a simple substitution code

819
00:52:01,462 --> 00:52:03,756
like the one that
we used to do as boy scouts.

820
00:52:03,756 --> 00:52:05,504
"A" is one, "B" is two.

821
00:52:05,504 --> 00:52:06,924
We weren't all boy scouts, Robert.

822
00:52:06,924 --> 00:52:10,588
Well, it's not that hard.
You just got to know where to start.

823
00:52:10,588 --> 00:52:12,462
In the first cipher...

824
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,798
You actually carry that around with you?

825
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:15,504
-Why?
-No reason.

826
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:20,168
What's the most common double
consonant in the English language?

827
00:52:20,168 --> 00:52:21,336
Consonant?

828
00:52:21,336 --> 00:52:22,756
-The double "L."
-Double "L."

829
00:52:22,756 --> 00:52:26,714
And what's the one word that we know
that he'll use in here, at least once?

830
00:52:26,714 --> 00:52:27,882
-"Kill."
-Right, "kill."

831
00:52:27,882 --> 00:52:29,420
So the Hardens start looking
for double symbols,

832
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:31,504
which they find here, here, and here.

833
00:52:31,504 --> 00:52:34,042
Each with the same
two symbols preceding them.

834
00:52:34,042 --> 00:52:36,084
So now they've got
a repeating four-letter word

835
00:52:36,084 --> 00:52:38,210
ending with two symbols
that they assume stand for "L."

836
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:39,756
And since they think the whole word
is "kill" then...

837
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:43,210
Then you got your "K," you got your "I,"
and you're on your way.

838
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:45,168
But how do you go
from "A" is one and "B" is two

839
00:52:45,168 --> 00:52:46,630
to figuring out this whole code?

840
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:49,546
Well, same way I did.
You go to the library.

841
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,840
In this book,

842
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:59,042
the author presents a very simple
substitution code in the preface.

843
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:02,084
Eight of the 26 symbols that
he suggests are found in this cipher.

844
00:53:02,084 --> 00:53:03,462
Yeah, but there are non-letter symbols

845
00:53:03,462 --> 00:53:04,966
because there's all
these medieval ones.

846
00:53:04,966 --> 00:53:07,546
I thought they looked medieval, too.

847
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,294
But then I found a code
written in the Middle Ages.

848
00:53:10,294 --> 00:53:11,378
Guess what it's called?

849
00:53:12,126 --> 00:53:13,924
The Zodiac Alphabet.

850
00:53:15,882 --> 00:53:17,084
Jesus.

851
00:53:18,252 --> 00:53:19,798
What do you want out of this?

852
00:53:19,798 --> 00:53:21,378
-What?
-What's your angle?

853
00:53:21,378 --> 00:53:24,252
This is good business
for everyone but you.

854
00:53:27,378 --> 00:53:29,168
How do you mean "business"?

855
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:34,672
Hey. Come to bed.

856
00:53:34,672 --> 00:53:37,966
I'll be up in a minute.
I need to make a phone call.

857
00:53:49,546 --> 00:53:51,252
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Bill?

858
00:53:52,084 --> 00:53:54,546
There's not many basements
in California.

859
00:53:54,546 --> 00:53:56,798
<i>"Basement for future use."</i>

860
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,420
That's right.

861
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:02,168
<i>I’ll have Vallejo and Napa</i>
<i>check with their city planners.</i>

862
00:54:02,168 --> 00:54:04,378
<i>-Get some sleep.</i>
-Yeah, sure.

863
00:54:17,294 --> 00:54:20,252
<i>"Dear Melvin,</i>
<i>this is the Zodiac speaking.</i>

864
00:54:20,252 --> 00:54:22,504
<i>"I wish you a happy Christmas.</i>

865
00:54:22,504 --> 00:54:26,042
<i>"The one thing I ask of you is this.</i>
<i>Please help me.</i>

866
00:54:26,042 --> 00:54:29,546
"I cannot reach out for help
because this thing in me won't let me."

867
00:54:29,546 --> 00:54:31,000
Thank you.

868
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,294
"I am finding it extremely difficult
to hold it in check

869
00:54:34,294 --> 00:54:37,000
"and I am afraid I will lose control again

870
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,924
"and take my ninth
and possibly tenth victim."

871
00:54:39,924 --> 00:54:42,336
Melvin, he's reaching out to you.

872
00:54:42,336 --> 00:54:43,756
Absolutely.

873
00:54:43,756 --> 00:54:47,378
Inspectors, he sent this letter
directly to my residence.

874
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:50,546
It is a cry for help,
intended as a private communiqué.

875
00:54:50,546 --> 00:54:52,756
Which is why
you contacted the Chronicle.

876
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:55,882
The people have a right to know.
Toddy?

877
00:54:55,882 --> 00:54:59,042
-When did the letter arrive?
-In the middle of last week.

878
00:54:59,042 --> 00:55:01,546
I was away on safari.

879
00:55:01,546 --> 00:55:03,420
What did you gentlemen
do for Christmas?

880
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,840
-You're looking at it.
-You must see Africa.

881
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:11,126
Cradle of civilization.
Fascinating people. Beautiful. Savage.

882
00:55:11,126 --> 00:55:15,000
-Back to the killer who wrote to you.
-Yes. Of course.

883
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
It is my belief
that he only penned this letter

884
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,126
because he couldn't get through to me
on the Dunbar show or here.

885
00:55:20,126 --> 00:55:22,756
-He tried to contact you here?
-Several times.

886
00:55:22,756 --> 00:55:25,000
I was out,
but he spoke with my housekeeper.

887
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,168
Didn't leave a number.

888
00:55:26,168 --> 00:55:28,798
He's kind of crafty like that.
Do you mind if I speak to her?

889
00:55:28,798 --> 00:55:32,000
Not at all. But the real story is the letter.

890
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,168
-I'll be back.
-Yeah.

891
00:55:34,168 --> 00:55:35,420
She's right this way.

892
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:40,840
Inspector Toschi, it is my belief
this is a window into this man's soul.

893
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,672
Killing is his compulsion.

894
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:45,336
Even though he tries to ignore it,
it drives him.

895
00:55:45,378 --> 00:55:46,504
It's in his blood.

896
00:55:46,504 --> 00:55:49,588
Could be.
Or maybe he just likes the attention.

897
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:38,798
I didn't mean to scare you,
but your right rear wheel is loose.

898
00:56:38,798 --> 00:56:39,924
Really?

899
00:56:39,924 --> 00:56:43,420
If you like,
I could tighten the lugs up for you.

900
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,252
If you don't mind.

901
00:56:47,252 --> 00:56:49,756
Well, you can't be too careful.

902
00:57:24,168 --> 00:57:26,672
-All done.
-Thank you.

903
00:57:26,672 --> 00:57:28,924
No problem. Have a good night.

904
00:57:33,882 --> 00:57:35,210
It's okay.

905
00:58:29,504 --> 00:58:31,168
Are you okay?

906
00:58:32,672 --> 00:58:35,336
Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

907
00:58:36,168 --> 00:58:38,714
Must have been worse than I thought.

908
00:58:38,714 --> 00:58:41,588
I can give you a lift to a service station.

909
00:58:43,798 --> 00:58:44,924
Okay.

910
00:58:51,252 --> 00:58:53,294
It's okay. Come on.

911
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,168
I didn't know you had a baby.

912
00:59:04,882 --> 00:59:06,546
Oh, is that okay?

913
00:59:08,084 --> 00:59:09,924
The more the merrier.

914
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:22,084
You shouldn't smoke. It's a bad habit.

915
00:59:28,546 --> 00:59:32,210
-I think we just passed a filling station.
-It was closed.

916
00:59:37,672 --> 00:59:40,840
Do you always go around
helping people in the night?

917
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:44,126
When I'm done with them,
they don't need much help.

918
00:59:46,966 --> 00:59:48,840
It's okay.

919
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,924
Before I kill you,

920
00:59:50,924 --> 00:59:53,798
I'm gonna throw your baby
out the window.

921
01:00:07,294 --> 01:00:10,504
No! Help! Please! No!

922
01:00:17,378 --> 01:00:20,378
She was on the side of the road.
She flagged me down.

923
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:22,126
-What happened to her?
-She said she jumped from a car.

924
01:00:22,126 --> 01:00:24,084
I found her like this.

925
01:00:24,084 --> 01:00:27,084
-What is it?
-Please, he said...

926
01:00:27,084 --> 01:00:30,000
-It'll be okay.
-Tried to kill me.

927
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,630
My baby!

928
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:35,126
-Where's her baby?
-She didn't have one when I stopped.

929
01:00:35,126 --> 01:00:36,798
Where's your baby?

930
01:00:43,252 --> 01:00:44,504
Jesus.

931
01:00:52,168 --> 01:00:54,630
-You hid it?
-In case he came back.

959
01:02:20,588 --> 01:02:22,798
Four letters in three months,

960
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:25,882
and this is the first mention
of Kathleen Johns. That's very weird.

That's because he's full of shit.

You don't know?

964
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:41,126
Welcome. Please put your stuff down.
You're going down five rows and left.

965
01:02:41,126 --> 01:02:43,840
Looking for the Modesto Bee
from March.

966
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,966
I'm going to stand here
and attempt not to vomit.

967

-Left.
-Left.

968
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,588
-What am I looking for?
-Kathleen Johns.

969
01:02:52,588 --> 01:02:53,882
Also probably you wanna
pull the Chron from...

970
01:02:53,882 --> 01:02:57,042
You know, never mind. I'll see to that.

971
01:02:58,168 --> 01:03:00,672
Okay, look at this letter again.
The part about Kathleen Johns.

972
01:03:00,672 --> 01:03:02,630
Tell me what facts he gives.

973
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:05,840
-A woman and her baby abducted.
-Fact.

974
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,210
-The car on fire.
-Okay, now,

975
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:14,084
look at the article from the Bee.

976
01:03:14,756 --> 01:03:16,420
Seen it yet?

977
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:18,420
Everything in the letter
already appeared in the article.

978
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,378
And he's done it before.

979
01:03:21,546 --> 01:03:24,294
Officer Richard Radetich,
shot sitting in his car.

980
01:03:24,294 --> 01:03:26,546
Zodiac claimed that he shot someone
in their car.

981
01:03:26,546 --> 01:03:30,168
Couple days after this article came out.

982
01:03:30,168 --> 01:03:31,924
The police already had somebody
in custody.

983
01:03:31,924 --> 01:03:34,588
Zodiac didn't do it,
but took credit for it anyway

984
01:03:34,588 --> 01:03:37,000
because he's in it for the press.

985
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,462
He even stole his symbol.

986
01:03:38,462 --> 01:03:40,840
-What?
-Yeah. Shit.

987
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,588
If I show you something,
you promise not to tell anyone?

988
01:03:42,588 --> 01:03:45,924
-Who would I tell?
-Okay. Totally solid point. Okay.

989
01:03:53,714 --> 01:03:55,504
That's the only place
that word and that symbol

990
01:03:55,504 --> 01:03:58,042
ever appeared together
before the letters.

991
01:03:58,042 --> 01:03:59,672
The guy stole his logo off a watch.

992
01:03:59,672 --> 01:04:01,084
How can somebody
who's killed 13 people do...

993
01:04:01,084 --> 01:04:02,420
He claims he's killed 13 people,

994
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:04,000
but which ones
can we actually confirm?

995
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,084
There's three in Vallejo,
one in Berryessa, the cabbie. That's it.

996
01:04:09,714 --> 01:04:12,210
Bobby, you almost look disappointed.

997
01:04:13,084 --> 01:04:15,588
Chief's pulling everybody off buses.

998
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:17,882
Business as usual.

999
01:04:17,882 --> 01:04:19,630
Something'll shake loose.

1000
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:21,924
Not a peep in four months.

1001
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:24,462
First he won't shut up and now...

1002
01:04:24,462 --> 01:04:26,798
Maybe we drove him underground.

1003
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:29,042
Maybe he's gone.

1004
01:04:30,084 --> 01:04:33,210

1006
01:04:45,672 --> 01:04:48,042
Does it ever bother you
that people call you Shorty?

1007
01:04:48,042 --> 01:04:50,630
Does it bother you

-Right.

a latent homosexual

1028

in at least one of your articles.

1029

Dave. I want a gun.

1030
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:06,756
A gun?

1031
01:06:11,336 --> 01:06:13,000
You're in Herb Caen.

1032

"Paul Avery's investigation

You should sell these.
You could do well.

It's been a windfall, since
they published the threat on my life.

1038
01:06:29,294 --> 01:06:31,084
I got the leads
coming out of the woodwork.

1039
01:06:31,084 --> 01:06:34,084
There's one guy down in Riverside.

1040
01:06:34,084 --> 01:06:35,336
I'm gonna drive down
and see him tonight.

-Really?
-Who is this guy?

1043

He wishes to remain anonymous.
I wish to remain infamous.

1044
01:06:45,798 --> 01:06:50,126
So we're going to get along great.

1045
01:06:56,882 --> 01:06:59,588
Hi. Good evening. Hi.
I'm looking for a Melanie.

1046
01:06:59,588 --> 01:07:01,546
Yes.
It's the young lady sitting by herself.

1047
01:07:01,588 --> 01:07:02,924
Thank you.

1048
01:07:09,294 --> 01:07:10,672
You must be Melanie.

1049
01:07:10,672 --> 01:07:12,672
-Which would make you Robert.
-It would.

1050
01:07:12,672 --> 01:07:15,966
Glynnis told me lots about you.

1051
01:07:15,966 --> 01:07:17,798
-And you have wine, great.
-I do.

1052
01:07:17,798 --> 01:07:19,714
Great. How late am I?

1053
01:07:21,588 --> 01:07:24,210
Just a few minutes, really.
I just got here myself.

1054
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:27,378
Traffic's bumper to bumper.
I was at the gun range.

1055
01:07:27,378 --> 01:07:30,546
-Glynnis said you were a cartoonist.
-Oh, yeah.

1056
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:32,504
Well, what're you doing at a gun range?

1057
01:07:32,504 --> 01:07:34,168
Reading.

1058
01:07:34,168 --> 01:07:37,084
Get some more...
You need some more napkins.

1059
01:07:38,378 --> 01:07:40,672
So, you work with Glynnis.

1060
01:07:40,672 --> 01:07:42,714
-For her, actually.
-For her?

1061
01:07:42,714 --> 01:07:44,378
Oh, well...

1062
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:48,378
My children are terrified of Glynnis.

1063
01:07:48,378 --> 01:07:49,672
Me, too.

1064
01:07:53,042 --> 01:07:54,294
So, the gun range?

1065
01:07:54,294 --> 01:07:57,336
We're... I'm working on...
Do you know the Zodiac?

1066
01:07:57,336 --> 01:07:58,756
-Yeah.
-I'm working with...

1067
01:07:58,756 --> 01:08:01,336
-Do you know who Paul Avery is?
-Sounds kind of familiar.

1068
01:08:01,336 --> 01:08:03,168
He's the writer
that the Zodiac threatened.

1069
01:08:03,168 --> 01:08:04,462
Oh, yeah, I saw that on TV.

1070
01:08:04,462 --> 01:08:07,714
Well, I work near him
and he's going down tonight

1071
01:08:07,714 --> 01:08:10,882
to track an anonymous tipster
down in Riverside.

1072
01:08:12,042 --> 01:08:14,210
Where is Riverside?

1073
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:15,756
It's near L.A.

1074
01:08:15,798 --> 01:08:19,420
Oh, wow. I don't think Paul knows
that it's that far away.

1075
01:08:21,588 --> 01:08:23,588
Sounds kind of dangerous.

1076
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:27,840
Yeah. How do you mean?

1077
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:30,336
Well, you said it was
an anonymous tip, right?

1078
01:08:30,336 --> 01:08:31,882
Yeah.

1079
01:08:31,882 --> 01:08:35,462
So it could be an ambush.
I mean, it could be the Zodiac.

1080
01:08:36,966 --> 01:08:39,462
Don't you think it's kind of stupid?

1081
01:08:39,462 --> 01:08:42,126
Yeah, yeah. Well, Paul has a gun.

1082
01:08:45,924 --> 01:08:48,420
So, do you know what's good here?

1083
01:08:50,252 --> 01:08:52,420
I've never been here before.

1084
01:08:54,504 --> 01:08:56,504
The pasta, spaghetti?

1085
01:08:58,210 --> 01:09:00,294
Are you ready to order yet?

1086
01:09:01,336 --> 01:09:04,252
Yeah, I'll have the penne vodka.
But could you do it in a cream sauce?

1087
01:09:04,252 --> 01:09:05,588
Of course.

1088
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:12,756
Maybe give us another minute?

1089
01:09:14,588 --> 01:09:16,630
Do you have any change?

1090
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:18,924
Oh, wait, no wait, hold on.

1091
01:09:18,924 --> 01:09:20,546
Nope. That's a penny.

1092
01:09:20,546 --> 01:09:22,042
Do you have to make a phone call?

1093
01:09:22,042 --> 01:09:25,546
Yeah, you know,
when you were saying that the Zodiac...

1094
01:09:26,126 --> 01:09:27,882
You know, when you said it
was dangerous, I just thought

1095
01:09:27,882 --> 01:09:30,000
-that it is dangerous, and it's...
-Stupid?

1096
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,714
Stupid. And I just thought that

1097
01:09:31,714 --> 01:09:35,504
I should call his wife
and just see if she's heard from him.

1098
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:39,252
I have some change.

1099
01:09:58,462 --> 01:10:01,798
Okay. Well, she said
she'd call when she heard from him.

1100
01:10:01,798 --> 01:10:03,294
-Good.
-Yeah.

1101
01:10:04,672 --> 01:10:08,126
Melanie, I should really go home
and wait for the call.

1102
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:14,714
Is this some sleazy plan
to get me to go home with you?

1103
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:16,882
What? No.

1104
01:10:19,378 --> 01:10:21,336
I'll get the food to go.

1105
01:10:23,042 --> 01:10:24,210
Hello!

1106
01:10:40,378 --> 01:10:43,210
Hi! I'm supposed
to meet somebody here.

1107
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:02,882
Anything?

1108
01:11:06,462 --> 01:11:07,840
You don't have to stay.

1109
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,378
Are you kidding?

1110
01:11:09,378 --> 01:11:12,504
This is the most interesting date
I've ever had.

1111
01:11:16,756 --> 01:11:17,966
<i>-Paul?</i>
-Robert?

1112
01:11:17,966 --> 01:11:19,630
-Yes.
-You sitting down?

1113
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:20,840
<i>Yes.</i>

1114
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:22,714
You're not gonna believe this.

1115
01:11:22,714 --> 01:11:23,840
Dave!

1116
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:26,546
<i>In a bizarre twist,</i>
<i>the hunted has become hunter.</i>

1117
01:11:26,546 --> 01:11:30,420
San Francisco Chronicle reporter
<i>and Zodiac target Paul Avery</i>

1118
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:32,588
<i>claims to have uncovered</i>

1119
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:37,126
<i>regarding the only unsolved homicide</i>
<i>in Riverside County's history,</i>

01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:40,420
<i>a 1966 Southern California murder,</i>

1121
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:43,462
<i>that Avery now believes</i>
<i>was the Zodiac's first victim.</i>

1122
01:11:43,462 --> 01:11:44,588
What?

1123
01:11:44,588 --> 01:11:45,840
-He didn't call you about this?
-Hang on!

1124
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,462
<i>The Riverside killer</i>
<i>wrote to the press letters</i>

1125
01:11:47,462 --> 01:11:51,378

<i>the Office of Questioned Documents.</i>

<i>The handwriting matches Zodiac's.</i>

1129
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,252
How'd he get the evidence
out of Riverside?

1130
01:12:00,252 --> 01:12:02,588
He took it to Sherwood
without telling us, the son of a bitch.

1131
01:12:02,588 --> 01:12:03,882
You know how bad this looks?

1132
01:12:03,882 --> 01:12:06,168
Hey, how do we know
that this lead is real?

1133
01:12:06,168 --> 01:12:08,546
It's very real. You know how I know?

1134
01:12:08,546 --> 01:12:10,420
Because I saw it on TV.

1135
01:12:16,462 --> 01:12:17,504
Excuse me.

1136
01:12:17,504 --> 01:12:18,672
Dave.

1137
01:12:19,042 --> 01:12:20,252
Hi.

1138
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:22,504
Dave, you know Mel Nicolai.
He's working the case for Justice.

1139
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:23,756
Good to see you, Mel.

1140
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:25,714
All due respect,
can someone explain to me

1141
01:12:25,714 --> 01:12:27,462
why I'm reading
about breaks in this case

1142
01:12:27,462 --> 01:12:29,378
in the Chronicle instead
of getting calls from you?

1143
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:30,546
We got screwed.

1144
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:31,840
Dave, come on.

1145
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,882
You do get your name in the paper a lot.
People talk.

1146
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:36,882
I don't ever talk about an open
investigation, period. Okay, Ken?

1147
01:12:36,882 --> 01:12:39,756
Dave? Hey. Hi.

1148
01:12:39,756 --> 01:12:42,420
Paul Avery. Can I catch a ride
with you gents when we get there?

1149
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:44,252
Not a good idea, Paul.

1150
01:12:45,126 --> 01:12:48,126
He's gonna make me take a cab
when we're going to the same place.

1151
01:12:48,126 --> 01:12:50,798
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>thank you for choosing PSA.</i>

1152
01:12:50,798 --> 01:12:53,000
-Fair enough. Fair enough.
<i>-Please take your seats at this time.</i>

1153
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,210
<i>Remember, smoking is</i>

-Cross? Hi.
-Yeah.

1156
01:13:03,882 --> 01:13:06,252
-Detective David Toschi, SFPD.
-How are you doing?

1157
01:13:06,252 --> 01:13:07,882
Great. Thanks for having us
down today.

1158
01:13:07,882 --> 01:13:10,462
Not at all.
I hear you have some files for us.

1159
01:13:10,462 --> 01:13:12,084
I'll show you mine. You show me yours.

1160
01:13:12,084 --> 01:13:14,462
-Frisco huh?
-That's right. San Francisco.

1161
01:13:15,084 --> 01:13:16,630
-Ken Narlow from Napa.
-Ken.

1162
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:18,462
-Mel Nicolai, Justice.
-Mel.

1163
01:13:18,462 --> 01:13:19,504
Here's what we know.

1164
01:13:19,504 --> 01:13:22,168
Cheri Jo Bates attended
Riverside Community College.

1165
01:13:22,168 --> 01:13:26,588
She studies in the library
the night of October 30th, 1966.

1166
01:13:26,588 --> 01:13:30,504
She leaves with an unidentified male
at closing, 9:00 p.m.

1167
01:13:30,504 --> 01:13:34,294
Her body's found the next morning
in a parking lot, stabbed to death.

1168
01:13:34,294 --> 01:13:35,714
Her car is disabled.

1169
01:13:35,714 --> 01:13:38,756
Someone cut the coil in the distributor,
the battery died.

1170
01:13:38,756 --> 01:13:41,252
The someone comes back,
offers to help.

1171
01:13:41,252 --> 01:13:43,504
-Like Kathleen Johns.
-Who?

1172
01:13:43,504 --> 01:13:46,252
A woman outside of Modesto,
might be a Zodiac victim.

1173
01:13:46,252 --> 01:13:49,882
Might. Might be.
I have her comp right here in this file.

1174
01:13:49,882 --> 01:13:51,168
Okay.

1175
01:13:51,168 --> 01:13:54,378
A typewritten confession was sent
<i>to the Riverside Press Enterprise</i>

1176
01:13:54,378 --> 01:13:57,252
on November 29th,
a month after Bates's murder.

1177
01:13:57,252 --> 01:13:58,672
They ran it.

1178
01:14:00,924 --> 01:14:03,714
"I'm not sick. I am insane.
But that will not stop the game.

1179
01:14:03,714 --> 01:14:06,000
"This letter should be published
for all to read."

1180
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,420
He wants to be published.
He calls it a game.

1181
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:08,882
I mean, this could be our boy.

1182
01:14:08,882 --> 01:14:12,294
Six months later, the police,
the girl's father, and the paper,

1183
01:14:12,294 --> 01:14:14,252
they all received these.

1184
01:14:19,084 --> 01:14:20,924
Double postage, just like Zodiac.

1185
01:14:22,462 --> 01:14:25,462
These are what Sherwood Morrill
matched the Zodiac letters?

1186
01:14:25,462 --> 01:14:27,588
These and the desktop. Don.

1187
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:31,924
This was found a couple of months later
by a janitor in RCC storage.

1188
01:14:40,882 --> 01:14:43,504
Sherwood got
a handwriting match off wood?

1189
01:14:45,378 --> 01:14:47,756
Who etches in their own handwriting?

1190
01:14:47,756 --> 01:14:49,000
To be honest with you,

1191
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,462
our letters and your letters,
I don't see it.

1192
01:14:51,462 --> 01:14:54,126
How did Paul Avery
get his hands on the exemplars?

1193
01:14:54,126 --> 01:14:55,588
I gave them to him.

1194
01:14:55,588 --> 01:14:57,546
We talked on the phone the other day
for about an hour.

1195
01:14:57,546 --> 01:14:59,126
And I told him you were gonna be here.

1196
01:14:59,126 --> 01:15:00,882
-You told him we were meeting?
-Yeah.

1197
01:15:00,882 --> 01:15:03,168
I also told him
we don't think this is Zodiac.

1198
01:15:03,168 --> 01:15:05,336
Okay, wait a minute.

1199
01:15:05,336 --> 01:15:08,504
-You don't think this is Zodiac?
-We got a guy we like for it.

1200
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:10,168
We don't have enough
to pin it on him yet,

1201
01:15:10,168 --> 01:15:11,504
but we're pretty sure it's him.

1202
01:15:11,504 --> 01:15:14,504
If you don't think this is Zodiac,
then why give anything to Avery?

1203
01:15:14,504 --> 01:15:16,210
I'm trying to cooperate.

1204
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:19,126
Oh, that's how you cooperate?
By giving information to reporters?

1205
01:15:19,126 --> 01:15:20,756
Look, I don't know
about the handwriting,

1206
01:15:20,756 --> 01:15:22,084
but Sherwood says it's a match, right?

1207
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:24,588
So, let's just say
that your guy did Cheri Jo.

1208
01:15:24,588 --> 01:15:25,840
He types the confession.

1209
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:29,084
Zodiac reads it in the paper,
and he writes a letter taking credit for it.

1210
01:15:29,084 --> 01:15:30,714
Now, that's something he's done before.

1211
01:15:30,714 --> 01:15:33,420
Look, now you have everything we have.

1212
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:36,798
But, in my opinion,
you guys came south for nothing.

1213
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:39,000
FUBAR, gentlemen, FUBAR.

1214
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,840
I don't care what he says.
This still could be Z.

1215
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:45,168
The problem is
the entire state already thinks it is.

1216
01:15:45,168 --> 01:15:48,546
Well, there's your press agent.
Talk to him about it.

1217
01:15:51,042 --> 01:15:53,042
I come in peace.
I don't want any trouble.

1218
01:15:53,042 --> 01:15:55,126
I really don't want to talk to you
right now, Paul. Not now.

1219
01:15:55,126 --> 01:15:59,168
-Just trying to do my job.
-Oh, really? Well, now I can't do mine.

1220
01:15:59,168 --> 01:16:01,294
We're already screwed with
the amount of tips we got on this thing,

1221
01:16:01,294 --> 01:16:03,084
and you just freaked out the entire state.

1222
01:16:03,126 --> 01:16:06,504
I have got Napa, Vallejo, and DOJ
looking at me sideways

1223
01:16:06,504 --> 01:16:09,420
and Riverside's telling me
I'm on a snipe hunt!

1224
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:12,168
Jesus. Hey, Cheri Jo Bates was a gift.
I gave that to you.

1225
01:16:12,168 --> 01:16:13,840
You and Armstrong
never would have found her.

1226
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,168
This may not be Zodiac.
Does that matter to you?

1227
01:16:16,168 --> 01:16:17,630
-What if it is?
-Does it matter that Riverside may not

1228
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:19,798
be able to make a case
against their suspect because of you?

1229
01:16:19,798 --> 01:16:21,798
Tell it to Sherwood.
I'm out here, beating the bushes,

1230
01:16:21,798 --> 01:16:23,462
trying to draw him out.
We're in this together.

1231
01:16:23,462 --> 01:16:24,924
No, we're not in anything together, Paul,

1232
01:16:24,924 --> 01:16:26,882
because I'm not interested
in upping my circulation.

1233
01:16:26,882 --> 01:16:29,882
Oh, boy. He wrote me.
He threatened my life.

1234
01:16:29,882 --> 01:16:31,588
Hey, Bullitt!

1235
01:16:31,588 --> 01:16:35,546
Been a year-and-a-half,
you gonna catch this fucking guy or not?

1236
01:16:37,672 --> 01:16:40,126
-Go fuck yourself.
-Happily.

1237
01:16:40,126 --> 01:16:42,168
You should have called me, Paul.

1238
01:16:47,714 --> 01:16:48,966
Thank you.

1239
01:17:02,210 --> 01:17:04,042
-Did you see this?
-Unfortunately, yes.

1240
01:17:04,042 --> 01:17:06,714
Here comes every lunatic in California.

1241
01:17:07,588 --> 01:17:08,966
I'm the Zodiac.

1242
01:17:08,966 --> 01:17:10,630
And how did you kill your victims?

1243
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:13,378
With a gun. No, with a hammer.

1244
01:17:13,378 --> 01:17:14,798
All I'm authorized to tell you

1245
01:17:14,798 --> 01:17:16,462
is that he's still under
government employment.

1246
01:17:16,462 --> 01:17:19,630
-And who authorized you to tell me this?
-That's all I'm authorized to say.

1247
01:17:19,630 --> 01:17:21,840
<i>Only a little rat bastard like Andre</i>

1248
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,504
could have done something
like cut off all the victims' hands.

1249
01:17:24,504 --> 01:17:27,000
Zodiac didn't cut off
any of the victims' hands.

1250
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,840
-Are you sure?
-Yes, sir.

1251
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:31,462
Travis and I worked here
side by side for 10 years.

1252
01:17:31,462 --> 01:17:35,630
His foot gets crushed in an accident
and the killings begin.

1253
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:37,252
-Coincidence?
-I don't know.

1254
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:39,126
You're a cop, man. Do the math.

1255
01:17:43,504 --> 01:17:46,840
Have you considered
the killer might be Paul Avery?

1256
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:48,042
Frequently.

1257
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:50,000
He was drinking Coors,
getting a load on.

1258
01:17:50,546 --> 01:17:54,294
Starts talking about hunting people.
Like that book.

1259
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:56,546
Says how you can put a light
at the end of a gun

1260
01:17:56,546 --> 01:17:58,168
to use as a sight in the dark.

1261
01:17:58,168 --> 01:18:00,042
-He said that?
-Yeah.

1262
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:02,966
So I asked him,
"How would you get away with it?"

1263
01:18:03,210 --> 01:18:05,042
And he said, "It would be easy

1264
01:18:05,042 --> 01:18:07,546
"'cause there'd be no real motive
to the thing."

1265
01:18:07,546 --> 01:18:09,546
Then he said he'd write letters
to the police

1266
01:18:09,546 --> 01:18:11,420
and call himself Zodiac
to mess with them.

1267
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:13,126
Leigh liked messing with people.

1268
01:18:13,126 --> 01:18:16,252
-You're positive he said "Zodiac"?
-Yeah.

1269
01:18:16,252 --> 01:18:19,462
I thought it was a stupid name.
So I told him.

1270
01:18:19,462 --> 01:18:22,966
He got up all upset and said,
"I don't care what you think.

1271
01:18:22,966 --> 01:18:25,714
"I've thought about it a long time
and that's the name I'm gonna use."

1272
01:18:25,714 --> 01:18:29,168
Did you feel like he'd been
thinking about it a long time?

1273
01:18:29,168 --> 01:18:32,504
He was raw about losing his job
at the school.

1274
01:18:32,504 --> 01:18:35,588
He talked about shooting out
the tires of a school bus

1275
01:18:35,588 --> 01:18:38,084
and picking off the little darlings.

1276
01:18:38,084 --> 01:18:42,252
-He actually used those words?
-That's what made me remember.

1277
01:18:42,252 --> 01:18:44,798
Afterwards, I told my wife
I didn't wanna see him again.

1278
01:18:44,798 --> 01:18:46,630
And I haven't since.

1279
01:18:46,630 --> 01:18:49,252
Other thing is, Leigh's into skin diving.

1280
01:18:49,252 --> 01:18:51,420
I know he's been up to that lake
a bunch of times.

1281
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:53,882
Lake Berryessa?
Did you ever go with him?

1282
01:18:53,882 --> 01:18:57,966
Couple times. We went fishing
by Putah Creek near there.

1283
01:18:57,966 --> 01:18:59,504
Tell him when you put it together.

1284
01:18:59,504 --> 01:19:04,336
About a year ago, in the paper,
there was a story about the Zodiac.

1285
01:19:04,336 --> 01:19:07,546
And it all comes back.
I tried to call the local cops.

1286
01:19:07,546 --> 01:19:09,210
They blew him off.
Thought he was a nut.

1287
01:19:09,210 --> 01:19:13,126
And you're sure
the conversation you had about Zodiac

1288
01:19:13,126 --> 01:19:17,000
took place on January 1st, 1968?

1289
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,840
It couldn't have been any later.

1290
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:21,756
I started a new job in L.A.
on January 20th.

1291
01:19:22,252 --> 01:19:23,840
I had to move.

1292
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,420
<i>-This is my problem. This guy...</i>
<i>-Arthur Leigh Allen?</i>

1293
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:29,126
This guy, Leigh,
just lays out his entire evil plan

1294
01:19:29,126 --> 01:19:30,714
to a fishing buddy on New Year's Day?

1295
01:19:30,714 --> 01:19:33,630
I don't know.
He's angry, he's been drinking,

1296
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:35,840
been thinking about it for a while.
I can buy that.

1297
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:38,294
So why didn't Cheney
contact us sooner?

1298
01:19:38,294 --> 01:19:39,840
I checked. He did.

1299
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,924
First recorded contact
with the police department about Allen

1300
01:19:42,924 --> 01:19:45,840
was in Pomona. January 10th, 1970.

1301
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,042
He just got lost in the shuffle.

1302
01:19:47,042 --> 01:19:48,798
Did Cheney have anything
against Allen?

1303
01:19:48,798 --> 01:19:50,210
Did Allen screw his wife or anything?

1304
01:19:50,210 --> 01:19:52,000
We're gonna do
a full background check.

1305
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,714
But I got to tell you, I like this guy.

1306
01:19:55,714 --> 01:19:57,630
So, let's pull
some handwriting samples.

1307
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:02,336
Hi. I talked to Sherwood.
He got the samples.

1308
01:20:02,336 --> 01:20:04,294
-What are you having?
-BLT.

1309
01:20:06,924 --> 01:20:09,546
So, the check stubs are a wash.
There's not enough handwriting.

1310
01:20:09,546 --> 01:20:12,168
The application's got more,
but it doesn't look like Z's,

1311
01:20:12,168 --> 01:20:14,588
so he can't rule him in.
But he can't rule him out, either.

1312
01:20:14,588 --> 01:20:17,504
-Well, that's vague.
-He needs more samples.

1313
01:20:18,546 --> 01:20:20,672
Also, our guy is a pervert.

1314
01:20:21,714 --> 01:20:23,672
When Mel got the application
from Valley Springs,

1315
01:20:23,672 --> 01:20:26,042
they told him that
Allen had been fired for touching kids.

1316
01:20:26,042 --> 01:20:28,210
-Touching?
-Polite euphemism.

1317
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:33,084
-So what do you want to do?
-Make some phone calls.

1318
01:20:33,084 --> 01:20:35,798
-Are you done with the fries?
-Go ahead.

1319
01:20:35,798 --> 01:20:37,336
<i>Did you and Mr. Cheney have a chance</i>

1320
01:20:37,336 --> 01:20:39,672
<i>to look at the copies</i>
<i>of the Zodiac letters we sent you?</i>

1321
01:20:39,672 --> 01:20:42,462
Yeah.
Some of this stuff is pretty creepy.

1322
01:20:42,462 --> 01:20:45,588
<i>-Yeah, we know that.</i>
-I mean, creepy like Leigh.

1323
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:48,546
He misspells words like that.
He thinks it's funny.

1324
01:20:48,546 --> 01:20:50,420
What about the handwriting?

1325
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:53,462
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Don't you have experts for that stuff?</i>

1326
01:20:53,462 --> 01:20:56,672
Our man at Questioned Documents
says it's inconclusive.

1327
01:20:56,672 --> 01:20:58,588
Maybe he did it with his other hand.

1328
01:20:58,588 --> 01:20:59,966
<i>The letters are a little too neat</i>

1329
01:20:59,966 --> 01:21:02,462
<i>for someone to have written</i>
<i>with the wrong hand.</i>

1330
01:21:02,462 --> 01:21:04,294
But not for Leigh, right.

1331
01:21:04,294 --> 01:21:06,294
-What do you mean?
<i>-He's ambidextrous.</i>

1332
01:21:06,294 --> 01:21:09,798
<i>He can write with either hand.</i>
<i>Didn't you guys know that?</i>

1333
01:21:09,798 --> 01:21:12,714
In everyday life, Allen uses his left hand.

1334
01:21:12,714 --> 01:21:15,252
Job applications,
letters to friends, et cetera.

1335
01:21:15,252 --> 01:21:18,000
But he writes the Zodiac letters
with his right hand

1336
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,798
producing a different handwriting
that he can't be linked to.

1337
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:23,672
We got to see this guy, Chief.

1338
01:21:23,672 --> 01:21:24,966
-Where is he?
-Vallejo.

1339
01:21:24,966 --> 01:21:28,126
He works at Union Oil in Pinole.
His brother's up there, too.

1340
01:21:28,126 --> 01:21:29,672
See them both.

1341
01:21:29,672 --> 01:21:32,252
Make sure you call Mulanax.
It is his backyard.

1342
01:21:32,252 --> 01:21:35,504
Oh, right, because that
worked so well for us in Riverside.

1343
01:21:35,504 --> 01:21:38,084
Cooperation, that's us, at all costs.

1344
01:21:47,672 --> 01:21:51,756
You can talk to him in here.
Coke machine's busted, by the way.

1345
01:21:52,882 --> 01:21:54,882
I'll go get him for you.

1346
01:21:56,336 --> 01:21:58,546
So how do you guys wanna do this?

1347
01:21:58,546 --> 01:22:02,294
Well, Bill talked to the informants.
He leads, we follow?

1348
01:22:02,294 --> 01:22:03,924
It's okay by me.

1349
01:22:17,798 --> 01:22:20,504
Mr. Allen, I'm Inspector Bill Armstrong.

1350
01:22:20,504 --> 01:22:23,504
This is Inspector Dave Toschi
and Sergeant Jack Mulanax.

1351
01:22:23,504 --> 01:22:27,966
We're investigating the Zodiac murders
in San Francisco and Vallejo.

1352
01:22:27,966 --> 01:22:29,588
Please, sit down.

1353
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:41,000
The informant notified us
that you made certain statements

1354
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,672
11 months prior
to the first Zodiac murder.

1355
01:22:43,672 --> 01:22:46,798
If they're true,
they're quite incriminating.

1356
01:22:46,798 --> 01:22:49,126
Do you recall
having any such conversation?

1357
01:22:49,126 --> 01:22:50,336
-No.
-Have you ever read

1358
01:22:50,336 --> 01:22:52,420
or heard anything about the Zodiac?

1359
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:53,756
When it was first in the paper.

1360
01:22:53,756 --> 01:22:55,924
But I didn't follow it
after those first reports.

1361
01:22:55,924 --> 01:22:58,462
-Why not?
-Too morbid. I...

1362
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:02,336
I told all this to the other officer.

1363
01:23:02,336 --> 01:23:04,840
-Which other officer?
-From Vallejo.

1364
01:23:06,210 --> 01:23:07,756
Do you remember his name?

1365
01:23:07,756 --> 01:23:11,588
No, but it was right after
the murder at the lake.

1366
01:23:11,588 --> 01:23:14,042
And what did you tell this officer?

1367
01:23:15,630 --> 01:23:19,966
I told him that I'd gone to Salt Point
that weekend to skin dive.

1368
01:23:19,966 --> 01:23:22,798
That I was alone
but I met a couple there.

1369
01:23:23,966 --> 01:23:26,168
I have their names at home
if you want them.

1370
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:27,924
That would be great, Arthur.

1371
01:23:27,924 --> 01:23:29,840
-Leigh.
-What?

1372
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:33,210
Leigh. Nobody calls me Arthur.

1373
01:23:34,966 --> 01:23:38,462
Also, that day when I came home,
my neighbor saw me.

1374
01:23:38,462 --> 01:23:42,336
It was around 4:00.
But I forgot to tell the other officer that.

1375
01:23:42,336 --> 01:23:44,546
-Neighbor's name?
-Bill White.

1376
01:23:46,336 --> 01:23:48,210
He died a week or so afterwards.

1377
01:23:48,210 --> 01:23:51,630
Heart attack.
So I didn't think to call to follow up.

1378
01:23:53,798 --> 01:23:55,966
The knives I had in my car
with the blood on them,

1379
01:23:55,966 --> 01:23:59,546
that blood came from a chicken
that I killed for dinner.

1380
01:24:02,336 --> 01:24:05,210
-What?
-I had knives in my car that weekend.

1381
01:24:05,210 --> 01:24:09,504
Maybe Bill saw them
and called the other officer on me.

1382
01:24:10,126 --> 01:24:13,294
Well, we'll be checking in on that.

1383
01:24:13,294 --> 01:24:14,840
Well, let me ask you something else.

1384
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:18,798
Were you ever in Southern California
at any time in 1966?

1385
01:24:19,798 --> 01:24:22,336
-Is this about the Riverside killing?
-Yes.

1386
01:24:23,420 --> 01:24:25,798
Well, I guess I was there
around that time.

1387
01:24:25,798 --> 01:24:29,126
I used to go down there a lot.
I like the auto races.

1388
01:24:33,462 --> 01:24:36,000
Informant says that
you're ambidextrous?

1389
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
No, that's untrue.

1390
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,336
You can't write with both hands?

1391
01:24:41,504 --> 01:24:44,672
My teachers tried to make me
when I was a kid, but I couldn't.

1392
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:46,882
I'm left-handed.

1393
01:24:46,882 --> 01:24:51,042
He also said that you made statements
about killing school children.

1394
01:24:51,756 --> 01:24:53,336
That is...

1395
01:24:53,336 --> 01:24:56,714
That is horrible. That is...
That's a horrible thing to say.

1396
01:24:56,714 --> 01:25:00,000
So, you weren't angry
about being fired from Valley Springs

1397
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,252
for touching your students?

1398
01:25:11,504 --> 01:25:13,210
I'm not the Zodiac.

1399
01:25:14,168 --> 01:25:17,168
And if I was, I certainly wouldn't tell you.

1400
01:25:19,378 --> 01:25:21,210
That's a nice watch.

1401
01:25:23,042 --> 01:25:24,168
Thank you.

1402
01:25:24,168 --> 01:25:25,630
May I see it?

1403
01:25:27,546 --> 01:25:29,000
May I see it?

1404
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:41,924
Where'd you get it?

1405
01:25:42,084 --> 01:25:44,924
It was Christmas gift
from my mother two years ago.

1406
01:25:44,924 --> 01:25:47,168
That's very sweet.

1407
01:25:47,168 --> 01:25:49,882
So, tell me something, Arthur.

1408
01:25:49,882 --> 01:25:51,000
You don't remember anyone

1409
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,882
you might have had a conversation with
regarding the Zodiac?

1410
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:01,420
Maybe Ted Kidder or Phil Tucker
at Vallejo Recreation.

1411
01:26:02,714 --> 01:26:04,630
But I couldn't be positive.

1412
01:26:04,630 --> 01:26:06,798
I used to work there when...

1413
01:26:10,462 --> 01:26:12,546
<i>The Most Dangerous Game.</i>

1414
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:15,000
What?

1415
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,294
<i>The Most Dangerous Game.</i>
That's why you're here, isn't it?

1416
01:26:18,294 --> 01:26:20,126
It was my favorite book in high school.

1417
01:26:20,126 --> 01:26:23,714
It's about this man who waits for people
to get shipwrecked on this island.

1418
01:26:23,714 --> 01:26:25,210
Because he was
tired of hunting animals,

1419
01:26:25,210 --> 01:26:26,882
he hunted the people for the challenge.

1420
01:26:26,882 --> 01:26:31,126
And man is the most
dangerous animal of all?

1421
01:26:31,126 --> 01:26:33,672
That's the whole point of the story.

1422
01:26:34,336 --> 01:26:35,714
Great book.

1423
01:26:36,924 --> 01:26:39,588
Or, at least, that's what I told Phil.

1424
01:26:45,168 --> 01:26:46,420
May I go?

1425
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,126
Sure.

1426
01:26:55,966 --> 01:27:00,336
-Thanks for your time.
-I'm willing to help in any way possible.

1427
01:27:00,336 --> 01:27:02,504
I look forward to the day

1428
01:27:02,504 --> 01:27:06,000
when police officers
are no longer referred to as pigs.

1429
01:27:06,966 --> 01:27:08,168
Thanks.

1430
01:27:09,252 --> 01:27:10,924
We'll be in touch.

1431
01:27:22,672 --> 01:27:26,882
So does anyone think this suspect
warrants further investigation?

1432
01:27:26,882 --> 01:27:29,882
These are copies of some
of the Zodiac letters that were sent.

1433
01:27:30,378 --> 01:27:33,798
We'd like you to take a look at them.

1434
01:27:33,798 --> 01:27:35,756
You think my brother's the Zodiac.

1435
01:27:35,756 --> 01:27:37,840
Well, we're looking at him.

1436
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,294
Are you going to arrest him?

1437
01:27:39,294 --> 01:27:43,336
Mrs. Allen, we don't arrest people
just because we're interested in them.

1438
01:27:43,336 --> 01:27:44,882
Well, Leigh's always been troubled.

1439
01:27:44,882 --> 01:27:47,084
Is it true about the children?

1440
01:27:47,630 --> 01:27:49,168
Unfortunately.

1441
01:27:49,168 --> 01:27:51,882
We don't see him much anymore
since we found out.

1442
01:27:51,882 --> 01:27:54,000
What are your feelings
about Don Cheney?

1443
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,420
Don Cheney? My old roommate?

1444
01:27:56,420 --> 01:27:59,504
-Was he the one who contacted you?
-That's confidential.

1445
01:27:59,504 --> 01:28:01,126
Well, Don's a very reliable guy.

1446
01:28:01,126 --> 01:28:04,294
If he were to tell you something,
I'd believe it to be true.

1447
01:28:04,294 --> 01:28:05,546
-This one.
-What about it?

1448
01:28:05,546 --> 01:28:07,798
Here, where he spells
"Christmas" with two "S's."

1449
01:28:07,798 --> 01:28:09,840
We got a Christmas card from Leigh
a couple years ago.

1450
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:12,966
He spelled it the exact same way.
Christ-mass.

1451
01:28:12,966 --> 01:28:15,798
-Would you still have that?
-I can look for it.

1452
01:28:15,798 --> 01:28:17,924
Thank you. That'd be great.

1453
01:28:19,042 --> 01:28:21,168
Is there anything else
we can do to help?

1454
01:28:21,168 --> 01:28:22,924
<i>The brother said</i>
<i>he would search Leigh's apartment</i>

1455
01:28:22,924 --> 01:28:24,252
next time he went out of town.

1456
01:28:24,252 --> 01:28:26,588
-That gets you around a warrant.
-For the time being.

1457
01:28:26,588 --> 01:28:29,924
If we do find something,
Mulanax will go to the DA in Vallejo,

1458
01:28:29,924 --> 01:28:31,756
and we could search the place properly.

1459
01:28:31,756 --> 01:28:33,336
Now I got a chance to talk to the cop

1460
01:28:33,336 --> 01:28:36,294
who interviewed Leigh Allen
two days after the Berryessa murders.

1461
01:28:36,294 --> 01:28:38,084
Doesn't remember how he got onto him,

1462
01:28:38,084 --> 01:28:41,210
but didn't think he looked like a killer
so he didn't like him for Z.

1463
01:28:41,210 --> 01:28:44,126
-But you do?
-I wish I could've taken the guy in there.

1464
01:28:44,126 --> 01:28:47,168
Take it slow, Dave.
Try and find more stuff for Sherwood.

1465
01:28:47,168 --> 01:28:49,294
A match'll get us farther
on the warrants.

1466
01:28:49,294 --> 01:28:52,504
-Avery's on two.
-Tell him to screw.

1467
01:28:52,504 --> 01:28:56,840
You want me to communicate that
verbatim or can I spice it up a little?

1468
01:29:06,630 --> 01:29:08,084
Christ, kid.

1469
01:29:09,714 --> 01:29:10,756
Yeah.

1470
01:29:10,756 --> 01:29:13,168
-Paul, I've been thinking...
-Oh, God save us all.

1471
01:29:13,168 --> 01:29:14,630
The letter to Melvin Belli

1472
01:29:14,630 --> 01:29:17,672
was sent exactly one year
after the Lake Herman Road murder.

1473
01:29:17,672 --> 01:29:19,504
And the one to Cheri Jo Bates' father

1474
01:29:19,504 --> 01:29:21,966
was sent exactly six months
after her death.

1475
01:29:21,966 --> 01:29:24,378
-She was killed a day before Halloween.
-Yeah.

1476
01:29:24,378 --> 01:29:25,966
And you received a Halloween card...

1477
01:29:25,966 --> 01:29:28,672
You know, these are all fascinating
pieces of news, Robert,

1478
01:29:28,672 --> 01:29:30,714
it's a bit early in the day.

1479
01:29:30,714 --> 01:29:33,588
Paul, it's 11:00 and we missed Editorial.

1480
01:29:38,168 --> 01:29:40,294
-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you up.
-No, no, no.

1481
01:29:40,294 --> 01:29:41,504
-I just thought that...
-No, no, no.

1482
01:29:47,126 --> 01:29:49,504
This suspect is not your Zodiac.

1483
01:29:51,588 --> 01:29:54,210
This sample matches the canceled
checks and the application?

1484
01:29:54,210 --> 01:29:55,294
Perfectly.

1485
01:29:55,294 --> 01:29:58,630
So we've just retested the left hand.
I mean, we know he's ambidextrous.

1486
01:29:58,630 --> 01:30:01,966
In 38 years, I've never seen anyone
that ambidextrous.

1487
01:30:01,966 --> 01:30:04,462
Both hands would have commonalities.

1488
01:30:04,798 --> 01:30:06,126
I'm sorry.

1489
01:30:06,588 --> 01:30:08,336
Just not gonna work.

1490
01:30:10,252 --> 01:30:12,756
<i>-Homicide, Toschi.</i>
-Dave, it's Jack Mulanax.

1491
01:30:12,756 --> 01:30:15,000
Hey. Mulanax. Yeah.

1492
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,504
<i>We struck out with the judge.</i>

1493
01:30:16,504 --> 01:30:18,210
<i>He won't sign off on a warrant</i>
<i>for Allen's house.</i>

1494
01:30:18,210 --> 01:30:20,378
-Why not?
-Said it wasn't enough.

1495
01:30:20,378 --> 01:30:22,798
Now, unless we bring him a handwriting
match or some evidence that...

1496
01:30:22,798 --> 01:30:25,252
How are we gonna get evidence
if we can't toss the house?

1497
01:30:25,252 --> 01:30:26,756
<i>I don't know.</i>

1498
01:30:27,252 --> 01:30:30,210
-I truly am sorry.
<i>-No, no. Thank you, Jack.</i>

1499
01:30:32,084 --> 01:30:33,252
What do you wanna do?

1500
01:30:33,252 --> 01:30:34,672
Don't know what I can do
without Vallejo.

1501
01:30:34,672 --> 01:30:37,630
We need Allen's right hand.
We can't get it without a warrant.

1502
01:30:37,630 --> 01:30:39,798
Are there other guys
you should be looking at?

1503
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,840
Only, what?

1504
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,840
Twenty-three hundred?

1505
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,210
Okay, then.

1506
01:30:48,378 --> 01:30:49,714
Okay, then.

1507
01:31:17,630 --> 01:31:20,378
Paul, you wrote the Justice Department

1508
01:31:20,378 --> 01:31:23,756
asking to be put in charge
of the Zodiac investigation?

1509
01:31:25,756 --> 01:31:27,756
I merely suggested...

1510
01:31:27,756 --> 01:31:29,042
On our letterhead?

1511
01:31:29,084 --> 01:31:31,210
...that those with intimate knowledge
of the case

1512
01:31:31,210 --> 01:31:33,252
create an information clearinghouse

1513
01:31:33,252 --> 01:31:35,462
to promote an exchange
and free flow of ideas.

1514
01:31:35,462 --> 01:31:38,588
-And that you run it.
-Well, who better than me?

1515
01:31:39,630 --> 01:31:41,168
The marked man.

1516
01:31:41,882 --> 01:31:43,924
Paul, if you want to work here,
I need three things.

1517
01:31:43,924 --> 01:31:45,462
One, stop boozing.

1518
01:31:45,504 --> 01:31:48,756
Two, stop doing
whatever else it is you're doing.

1519
01:31:48,756 --> 01:31:52,336
And three, cut this nonsense out.

1520
01:31:52,336 --> 01:31:55,546
Sweetest of Templetons, if at any time

1521
01:31:55,546 --> 01:32:00,840
you feel my excellent work is no longer
in step with this trashy provincial rag,

1522
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:02,588
I'll more than happily...

1523
01:32:02,588 --> 01:32:06,168
More than happily
decamp for greener pastures.

1524
01:32:06,168 --> 01:32:07,798
Paul, I mean it!

1525
01:32:17,966 --> 01:32:19,966
-Paul?
-Yep.

1526
01:32:19,966 --> 01:32:23,168
-What was that?
-An editorial tête-à-tête.

1527
01:32:24,336 --> 01:32:26,504
-Wanna grab a drink?
-It's 10:00 in the morning.

1528
01:32:26,504 --> 01:32:28,336
Late breakfast?

1529
01:32:29,378 --> 01:32:31,504
-Early lunch, or...
-Paul.

1530
01:32:33,966 --> 01:32:35,420
Are you okay?

1531
01:32:36,252 --> 01:32:37,336
No.

1532
01:32:40,756 --> 01:32:42,588
Thank you for asking.

1533
01:32:44,798 --> 01:32:47,000
Shorty! Let's go out for one.

1534
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,042
Paul, where are you going?

1535
01:32:51,084 --> 01:32:52,672
<i>So, you moved off my brother-in-law?</i>

1536
01:32:53,672 --> 01:32:55,630
We couldn't get a warrant.

1537
01:32:57,252 --> 01:33:00,798
Last year we arranged for Leigh
to get help from a social worker.

1538
01:33:00,798 --> 01:33:02,546
He only went twice.

1539
01:33:02,546 --> 01:33:05,588
We saw him recently for
the first time in nine months.

1540
01:33:05,588 --> 01:33:08,840
My mother-in-law brought him by
to see the new baby.

1541
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:12,252
After he left,
I went to see that social worker.

1542
01:33:12,252 --> 01:33:15,672
He couldn't talk about a former patient,
so I just asked him straight out

1543
01:33:15,672 --> 01:33:17,924
if he thought Leigh
was capable of killing people.

1544
01:33:17,966 --> 01:33:21,210
-Because of patient confidentiality...
-The man said yes.

1545
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,294
Why hadn't you seen him
in nine months?

1546
01:33:25,294 --> 01:33:27,294
He's going to school in Santa Rosa.

1547
01:33:27,294 --> 01:33:30,714
-Santa Rosa? Where is he living?
-In his trailer.

1548
01:33:30,714 --> 01:33:32,840
-In Santa Rosa?
-Sonoma County.

1549
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:35,168
We wouldn't have to go
through the Vallejo DA.

1550
01:33:35,168 --> 01:33:36,756
It's been 11 months
since you talked to this guy,

1551
01:33:36,756 --> 01:33:38,378
and now you wanna search his trailer?

1552
01:33:38,378 --> 01:33:40,252
If we find something, great.

1553
01:33:40,252 --> 01:33:43,546
If not, we get his prints and
handwriting samples from both hands.

1554
01:33:43,546 --> 01:33:45,924
I thought Sherwood shut you down.

1555
01:33:46,630 --> 01:33:49,126
What if I can get a second opinion?

1556
01:33:50,252 --> 01:33:52,378
I don't wanna step on Sherwood's toes.
He trained me at this.

1557
01:33:52,378 --> 01:33:55,252
Terry, all I need to know
is if the suspect is ambidextrous.

1558
01:33:55,252 --> 01:33:59,252
Could he possibly have written
those letters with his other hand?

1559
01:34:00,924 --> 01:34:02,378
Between you and me?

1560
01:34:02,378 --> 01:34:05,840
Because there are differing
schools of thought on this.

1561
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:11,546
Get the samples of his other hand.
If he's the Zodiac, you'll get a match.

1562
01:34:11,546 --> 01:34:14,210
<i>That's the current thinking,</i>
<i>according to Terry Pascoe.</i>

1563
01:34:14,210 --> 01:34:17,588
Meanwhile, I spoke to a psychologist
who'd be willing to testify

1564
01:34:17,588 --> 01:34:20,672
that someone who undergoes
a personality change like Zodiac

1565
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:23,714
would manifest it physically,
altering his handwriting.

1566
01:34:23,714 --> 01:34:27,420
Which is why Sherwood couldn't
get a match from Allen's samples.

1567
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:29,756
We got Terry Pascoe,
this psychology guy,

1568
01:34:29,756 --> 01:34:31,168
coupled with Cheney...

1569
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:32,756
It could be enough for a warrant.

1570
01:34:32,756 --> 01:34:33,924
Get Cheney on the record.

1571
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:37,252
"And that he would call himself Zodiac."

1572
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:39,462
Yes.

1573
01:34:39,462 --> 01:34:43,126
And you're willing to swear
to this, under oath, in Superior Court?

1574
01:34:43,126 --> 01:34:44,630
Without any hesitation.

1575
01:34:44,630 --> 01:34:46,882
Thank you very much, Mr. Cheney.
Thank you very much for your time.

1576
01:34:46,882 --> 01:34:48,000
Thank you.

1577
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,924
Suspect is Arthur Leigh Allen.

1578
01:34:49,924 --> 01:34:53,756
Lives in Sunset Trailer Court
in Santa Rosa, California.

1579
01:34:53,756 --> 01:34:55,420
Physical description.

1580
01:34:55,420 --> 01:34:57,756
Allen is similar in height,
weight and build

1581
01:34:57,756 --> 01:35:00,966
to a man seen at Lake Berryessa
on the day of the stabbings.

1582
01:35:00,966 --> 01:35:03,840
<i>I understand he doesn't look</i>
<i>much like the San Francisco composite.</i>

1583
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,462
True. Height and weight are sketchy,

1584
01:35:05,504 --> 01:35:07,798
but lumbering Caucasian
with a crew cut is right on.

1585
01:35:07,798 --> 01:35:10,168
We never had much confidence
in the composite from the kids.

1586
01:35:10,168 --> 01:35:12,294
The patrolman
who say Zodiac that night

1587
01:35:12,294 --> 01:35:13,840
said he didn't look much like the sketch.

1588
01:35:13,882 --> 01:35:15,420
Military boot prints.

1589
01:35:15,420 --> 01:35:18,252
Allen was in the Navy.
Wears a size 10-and-a-half.

1590
01:35:18,252 --> 01:35:20,798
Same size as the prints
found at Berryessa.

1591
01:35:20,798 --> 01:35:22,588
<i>What about gun?</i>

1592
01:35:22,588 --> 01:35:27,252
Cheney says Allen owns several
firearms. We'll list them in the warrant.

1593
01:35:27,252 --> 01:35:30,126
<i>-And the ciphers.</i>
-Could be code training in the Navy,

1594
01:35:30,126 --> 01:35:32,966
and people have seen Allen
with ciphers in the past.

1595
01:35:32,966 --> 01:35:34,084
<i>Really? Who?</i>

1596
01:35:34,084 --> 01:35:36,966
That would be his sister-in-law
and a man named Phil Tucker

1597
01:35:36,966 --> 01:35:39,378
that he worked with
at a public pool in Vallejo.

1598
01:35:39,378 --> 01:35:42,966
And Phil Tucker told us about
a conversation that he had with Allen

1599
01:35:42,966 --> 01:35:45,756
about how to attach a flashlight
to the barrel of a gun.

1600
01:35:45,756 --> 01:35:49,084
That gives us two sources
on the ciphers and two on the flashlight.

1601
01:35:49,084 --> 01:35:51,210
<i>What about his threats on children?</i>

1602
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:53,042
Suspect worked for elementary schools

1603
01:35:53,042 --> 01:35:56,378
and was fired for molestation
in March, April '68.

1604
01:35:56,378 --> 01:35:59,084
-Could give him motive.
-At the very least, it's home turf.

1605
01:35:59,084 --> 01:36:01,252
He'd have knowledge of bus routes,

1606
01:36:01,252 --> 01:36:03,798
which the two major threats
centered around.

1607
01:36:03,798 --> 01:36:05,546
<i>What about the bomb?</i>

1608
01:36:06,966 --> 01:36:09,000
Allen works as a chemist.

1609
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,546
Take him through the geography.

1610
01:36:10,546 --> 01:36:12,126
Vallejo murders.

1611
01:36:12,126 --> 01:36:15,714
Allen lives in Vallejo
with his mother in her basement.

1612
01:36:15,714 --> 01:36:19,000
Berryessa murder. On the day
that the two kids were stabbed

1613
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,756
his neighbor saw bloody knives
in his truck

1614
01:36:21,756 --> 01:36:24,756
which he claimed were used
to kill a chicken.

1615
01:36:24,756 --> 01:36:26,714
<i>Does he have any alibis?</i>

1616
01:36:26,714 --> 01:36:29,462
He claimed he did, but he's been unable
to produce the names

1617
01:36:29,462 --> 01:36:32,840
of the couple he supposedly met
on the day of Berryessa.

1618
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:35,294
The bottom line is that Allen
can't alibi up on anything.

1619
01:36:35,294 --> 01:36:37,210
Riverside, Vallejo, the lake or us.

1620
01:36:37,210 --> 01:36:39,504
-You want to tell me about the name?
<i>-What name?</i>

1621
01:36:39,504 --> 01:36:40,714
Zodiac.

1622
01:36:40,714 --> 01:36:44,714
Allen wears a watch that bears
both the word and crosshair symbol.

1623
01:36:44,714 --> 01:36:46,168
And he mentioned Zodiac to Cheney

1624
01:36:46,168 --> 01:36:48,756
a year and a half
before it appeared in any letter.

1625
01:36:51,924 --> 01:36:54,462
-John...
<i>-That's pretty good, guys.</i>

1626
01:36:54,462 --> 01:36:57,462
-We think so, too.
<i>-Let's take it to a judge.</i>

1627
01:37:17,630 --> 01:37:19,000
Mr. Allen?

1628
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,126
This is the
Santa Rosa Police Department.

1629
01:37:21,126 --> 01:37:23,966
We have a warrant
to search your residence.

1630
01:37:34,966 --> 01:37:36,126
Hello?

1631
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:47,084
I'll check with the neighbors.

1632
01:37:48,378 --> 01:37:49,504
Close the door.

1633
01:37:49,504 --> 01:37:52,588
Close the door,
there's rodents running around.

1634
01:38:04,924 --> 01:38:07,546
Neighbor said he tore out of here
about a half-hour ago.

1635
01:38:07,546 --> 01:38:11,882
-You think somebody tipped him?
-We're not leaving till he comes back.

1636
01:38:17,714 --> 01:38:19,462
I'll check the back.

1637
01:38:32,168 --> 01:38:33,294
Jesus.

1638
01:38:33,294 --> 01:38:34,924
-What?
-Squirrels.

1639
01:38:37,042 --> 01:38:39,042
Piece of work, this guy.

1640
01:38:45,924 --> 01:38:48,714
Not one, but two blue windbreakers.

1641
01:38:48,714 --> 01:38:52,420
-Like the Stine scene?
-We'll have those checked for blood.

1642
01:38:52,882 --> 01:38:55,798
And a pair of black gloves.

1643
01:38:57,126 --> 01:39:00,504
Men's seven,
just like the ones we found in the cab.

1644
01:39:00,504 --> 01:39:03,168
Well, he's got the same size shoes
and gloves as Z.

1645
01:39:03,168 --> 01:39:05,672
Probably just a coincidence.

1646
01:39:05,672 --> 01:39:09,546
Dave, I got a gun.
Check that. Two guns.

1647
01:39:10,714 --> 01:39:14,042
They're both .22s.
One automatic, one revolver.

1648
01:39:14,042 --> 01:39:15,672
Well, that's interesting.

1649
01:39:15,672 --> 01:39:18,924
Because he happens to have
an M-1 rifle here in the closet.

1650
01:39:18,924 --> 01:39:21,546
For little darlings bouncing off buses.

1651
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,546
Someone's here.

1652
01:39:31,462 --> 01:39:33,924
Hello, Arthur. Remember us?

1653
01:39:56,462 --> 01:39:57,630
No.

1654
01:39:57,630 --> 01:39:58,798
On the handwriting?

1655
01:39:58,798 --> 01:40:02,420
Ballistics, no match.
Prints, no match. Writing, no match.

1656
01:40:02,420 --> 01:40:04,252
On both hands, right?

1657
01:40:04,252 --> 01:40:06,126
Because we got handwriting
from both his hands.

1658
01:40:06,168 --> 01:40:07,588
And neither hand matches.

1659
01:40:07,588 --> 01:40:09,336
Forget Sherwood.
Let's get another opinion.

1660
01:40:09,336 --> 01:40:11,336
Fellas, he's not your guy.

1661
01:40:18,042 --> 01:40:19,252
Damn it.

1662
01:40:26,420 --> 01:40:27,504
Hey.

1663
01:40:28,336 --> 01:40:30,924
What do you want? Time off?

1664
01:40:33,126 --> 01:40:34,252
A hug?

1665
01:40:35,126 --> 01:40:37,168
Do you know what
the worst part of this is?

1666
01:40:37,168 --> 01:40:39,168
I can't tell if I wanted it
to be Allen so bad

1667
01:40:39,168 --> 01:40:42,546
because I actually thought it was him,
or I just want all this to be over.

1668
01:40:42,546 --> 01:40:44,546
It's because you thought it was him.

1669
01:40:44,546 --> 01:40:46,084
And I did, too.

1670
01:40:48,882 --> 01:40:50,378
You know what? Take some time off.

1671
01:40:50,378 --> 01:40:53,756
Spend some time with your wife
and the kids.

1672
01:40:53,756 --> 01:40:56,336
Go to Candlestick. See a movie.

1673

<i>"and I will set up meeting.</i>

1678
01:41:15,084 --> 01:41:16,798
<i>"If I do not hear from you,</i>

1679
01:41:16,798 --> 01:41:19,798
<i>"it will be my next pleasure</i>
<i>to kill a Catholic priest or a...</i>

1680
01:41:23,210 --> 01:41:24,672
<i>" ...Scorpio."</i>

1681
01:41:27,042 --> 01:41:28,588
<i>Who's out of their minds?</i>

1682
01:41:28,588 --> 01:41:30,756
I've got to get out of here.

1683
01:41:30,756 --> 01:41:34,126
<i>Where the hell does he expect me</i>
<i>to find $100,000?</i>

1684
01:41:34,126 --> 01:41:36,588
<i>You're not thinking of paying him,</i>
<i>are you, Mr. Mayor?</i>

1685
01:41:36,588 --> 01:41:40,966
<i>The city of San Francisco does not</i>
<i>pay criminals not to commit a crime.</i>

1686
01:42:03,924 --> 01:42:06,462
The killer gets shot in the chest.

1687
01:42:06,462 --> 01:42:08,756
That's how it ends.

1688
01:42:09,210 --> 01:42:10,924
Do I know you?

1689
01:42:10,924 --> 01:42:13,798
I'm Robert Graysmith.
I work at the Chronicle with Paul Avery.

1690
01:42:13,798 --> 01:42:15,462
Dave Toschi. Nice to meet you.

1691
01:42:15,462 --> 01:42:18,042
Dave! That Harry Callahan
did a hell of a job with your case.

1692
01:42:18,042 --> 01:42:20,672
Yeah. No need for due process, right?

1693
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,084
-What do you do at the Chronicle?
-I'm a cartoonist.

1694
01:42:27,084 --> 01:42:28,504
That's nice.

1695
01:42:28,504 --> 01:42:30,420
You're gonna catch him.

1696
01:42:32,042 --> 01:42:34,882
Pal, they're already
making movies about it.

1697
01:42:42,630 --> 01:42:45,672
<i>We today have concluded</i>
<i>an agreement</i>

1698
01:42:45,672 --> 01:42:49,378

<i>with honor in Vietnam.</i>

1699

<i>kidnapping case.</i>

1701
01:42:54,924 --> 01:42:57,294
<i>In the murder trial of one...</i>

1702
01:42:57,294 --> 01:42:59,168
<i>Chairman Mao died today...</i>

<i>...an absolute pardon</i>

1704

<i>-No, I’m not a crook...</i>
<i>-...Generation of hostility...</i>

<i>Patricia Hearst is kidnapped</i>

1708
01:43:15,756 --> 01:43:19,084
<i>All of us should stand up together</i>
<i>and say, "No more."</i>

1709

1710
01:43:23,420 --> 01:43:26,126
<i>Americans admire</i>

1711
01:43:26,126 --> 01:43:28,252
<i>Mr. Hoffa has disappeared.</i>

1712
01:43:28,252 --> 01:43:31,798
<i>If we despise our own government...</i>

1713
01:43:32,714 --> 01:43:35,126
<i>...that the police have captured a man</i>

1714
01:43:35,126 --> 01:43:36,798
<i>whom they believe</i>

1715
01:43:52,252 --> 01:43:54,462
Hi. We haven't met.

1716
01:43:54,462 --> 01:43:56,546
I'm Robert Graysmith.

1717
01:43:56,546 --> 01:43:58,504
I'm Duffy Jennings.

1718
01:43:58,504 --> 01:44:01,714
-Nice to meet you.
-Good to meet you, man.

1719
01:44:01,714 --> 01:44:02,924
You got a great desk.

1720
01:44:02,924 --> 01:44:05,042
Guy who used to work here
was a great reporter.

1721
01:44:05,042 --> 01:44:06,420
Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm sure he was.

1722
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:09,000
I mean, it's a honor
to leave the Chronicle

1723
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,882
and go work for the Sacramento Bee.

1724
01:44:11,882 --> 01:44:14,084
Dare to dream, right, Robert?

1725
01:44:17,756 --> 01:44:20,714
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too.

1726
01:44:20,714 --> 01:44:22,924
I'm just right down there
at the Art department

1727
01:44:22,924 --> 01:44:25,378
-if you need anything, Duffy.
-Yeah.

1728
01:44:28,924 --> 01:44:31,672
-You sure you don't want the car, Bill?
-It's your turn.

1729
01:44:31,672 --> 01:44:34,966
You could just drop me off at my place
and take the car.

1730
01:44:34,966 --> 01:44:36,924
You should keep the car.

1731
01:44:37,672 --> 01:44:38,756
Yeah?

1732
01:44:39,294 --> 01:44:41,378
I'm not coming in tomorrow.

1733
01:44:43,336 --> 01:44:44,840
Why? What's up?

1734
01:44:46,042 --> 01:44:47,336
I'm done.

1735
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:50,798
I put in for a transfer.

1736
01:44:56,798 --> 01:44:58,084
Where?

1737
01:44:58,462 --> 01:45:00,084
Looking at Fraud.

1738
01:45:02,294 --> 01:45:04,420
I can't be on call anymore.

1739
01:45:07,168 --> 01:45:09,462
I wanna see these kids grow up.

1740
01:45:10,630 --> 01:45:12,882
Hey, good for you, Bill.

1741
01:45:14,756 --> 01:45:17,294
-You'll be okay.
-Yeah. I'll be fine.

1742
01:45:19,336 --> 01:45:20,378
Hey,

1743
01:45:21,462 --> 01:45:24,924
I'm not leaving you
holding the bag on anything, am I?

1744
01:45:26,588 --> 01:45:27,630
No.

1745
01:45:29,966 --> 01:45:31,042
Okay.

1746
01:45:31,714 --> 01:45:33,420
Hey, you know what?

1747
01:45:34,042 --> 01:45:38,294
Maybe you'll have a chance
to try your Japanese food, the raw stuff.

1748
01:45:39,252 --> 01:45:40,336
Yeah.

1749
01:46:12,294 --> 01:46:14,042
I'm not Paul Avery.

1750
01:46:16,924 --> 01:46:19,966
The boys need to be tucked in, please,
and the baby needs changing.

1751
01:46:19,966 --> 01:46:22,294
-I'll flip you for it.
-You wish.

1752
01:46:25,714 --> 01:46:28,420
Nobody has more Zodiac crap
than you do.

1753
01:47:13,126 --> 01:47:15,336
-Are you kidding me?
-Hi, Paul.

1754
01:47:17,084 --> 01:47:19,840
Permission to come aboard.
It's right there.

1755
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:22,420
Anyway, you got shoes on.
This is perfect right here.

1756
01:47:22,420 --> 01:47:24,336
-That's the one.
-Okay.

1757
01:47:26,042 --> 01:47:28,966
-See that? Mesmerizing.
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1758
01:47:28,966 --> 01:47:31,630
My own kids
would kill me for one of those.

1759
01:47:33,462 --> 01:47:35,798
-How are you?
-Fantastic.

1760
01:47:35,798 --> 01:47:38,042
I mean, admittedly,

1761
01:47:38,042 --> 01:47:40,462
the <i>Bee</i> ain't exactly
the <i>Chron</i>, but fuck it, right?

1762
01:47:40,462 --> 01:47:43,462
Do you want a drink?
I don't have anything blue, but I got...

1763
01:47:43,462 --> 01:47:45,546
Don't worry about that.
Don't worry about it.

1764
01:47:45,546 --> 01:47:49,126
It's no bother at all.
Nobody comes by from the old days.

1765
01:47:49,504 --> 01:47:50,588
Cheers.

1766
01:47:51,294 --> 01:47:53,462
To your health and mine.

1767
01:47:55,378 --> 01:47:56,798
Mostly mine.

1768
01:48:01,966 --> 01:48:03,504
So,

1769
01:48:05,672 --> 01:48:07,042
what's new?

1770
01:48:09,042 --> 01:48:11,042
-I've been thinking.
-Yeah.

1771
01:48:11,042 --> 01:48:12,252
Somebody should write a book.

1772
01:48:12,252 --> 01:48:15,294
Somebody should write a fucking book,
that's for sure.

1773
01:48:15,294 --> 01:48:17,462
-About what?
-About Zodiac.

1774
01:48:19,084 --> 01:48:20,588
It's not new.

1775
01:48:20,588 --> 01:48:25,294
I've been thinking that
if you put all the information together,

1776
01:48:25,294 --> 01:48:26,966
maybe you could jog something loose.

1777
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,588
And then I was thinking that
nobody knows the case better than you.

1778
01:48:29,588 --> 01:48:30,714
Yeah. That's true.

1779
01:48:30,714 --> 01:48:33,840
You know all the players,
and you have all the files.

1780
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:35,168
Lost them.

1781
01:48:35,462 --> 01:48:36,630
You lost them?

1782
01:48:36,630 --> 01:48:39,924
Or I tossed them. I don't know.
I moved onto a boat.

1783
01:48:40,336 --> 01:48:42,504
You know that we work
in the daily business, right?

1784
01:48:42,504 --> 01:48:43,882
As in, today.

1785
01:48:43,882 --> 01:48:46,672
What do you think
we were doing back then?

1786
01:48:47,630 --> 01:48:49,882
Do you know that more people die
in the East Bay commute

1787
01:48:49,882 --> 01:48:52,252
every three months
than that idiot ever killed?

1788
01:48:52,294 --> 01:48:53,546
He offed a few citizens,

1789
01:48:53,546 --> 01:48:56,924
he wrote a few letters,
and he faded into a footnote.

1790
01:49:02,378 --> 01:49:05,504
Not that I haven't been sitting here idly

1791
01:49:05,504 --> 01:49:09,462
waiting for you to drop by
and reinvigorate my sense of purpose.

1792
01:49:11,798 --> 01:49:15,042
It was four years ago. Let it fucking go.

1793
01:49:15,042 --> 01:49:17,756
You're wrong. It was important.

1794
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,546
Then, what did you ever do about it?

1795
01:49:22,378 --> 01:49:24,588
If it was so fucking important,
what did you ever do?

1796
01:49:24,630 --> 01:49:27,546
You hovered over my desk,
you stole from wastebaskets.

1797
01:49:27,546 --> 01:49:29,210
Am I being unkind?

1798
01:49:30,336 --> 01:49:33,630
Oh, that's right, I forgot.
You went to the library.

1799
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:38,420
I'm sorry I bothered you.

1800
01:50:00,504 --> 01:50:02,630
-Hey, hi.
-Hi.

1801
01:50:02,630 --> 01:50:05,126
-Where you been?
-The library.

1802
01:50:36,714 --> 01:50:38,042
Thank you!

1803
01:50:53,756 --> 01:50:57,168
-Inspector Toschi?
-Yeah? One moment, please.

1804
01:51:01,504 --> 01:51:02,756
-Hi.
-Hi.

1805
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,042
We met at the movies once.

1806
01:51:06,504 --> 01:51:07,966
It must have been magical.

1807
01:51:07,966 --> 01:51:09,798
I'm Robert Graysmith.
I work at the Chronicle.

1808
01:51:09,798 --> 01:51:12,630
I was wondering if I could buy you lunch.

1809
01:51:14,336 --> 01:51:16,084
Sure, why not?

1810
01:51:16,084 --> 01:51:18,546
So, you're a friend of Paul Avery's?

1811
01:51:18,546 --> 01:51:21,000
He's actually the reason I'm here.

1812
01:51:22,714 --> 01:51:25,084
I wanted to ask you about Zodiac.

1813
01:51:25,546 --> 01:51:28,882
Well, I appreciate the interest,
but we don't discuss open cases.

1814
01:51:28,882 --> 01:51:31,504
Oh, well, what's going on with it,
day to day?

1815
01:51:31,504 --> 01:51:33,252
We're actively pursuing all leads.

1816
01:51:33,252 --> 01:51:35,882
And you're the only one on it, right?

1817
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:38,504
Mr. Graysmith,

1818
01:51:39,630 --> 01:51:41,672
Zodiac hasn't written in three years.

1819
01:51:41,672 --> 01:51:44,504
You know how many murders
we've had in San Francisco since then?

1820
01:51:44,504 --> 01:51:46,126
-No.
-Over 200.

1821
01:51:46,126 --> 01:51:49,504
That's a lot of dead people
and grieving families that need our help.

1822
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:51,252
So, nobody cares.

1823
01:51:51,252 --> 01:51:53,714
Excuse me? I care.

1824
01:51:56,378 --> 01:51:58,672
Okay. Can I show you something?

1825
01:52:01,546 --> 01:52:04,840
I've been doing research
on the first cipher.

1826
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:06,714
Everything an amateur
would need to create it

1827
01:52:06,714 --> 01:52:09,756
can be found in these books.

1828
01:52:09,756 --> 01:52:13,210
Now, I started thinking
that if you can track these books,

1829
01:52:13,210 --> 01:52:15,630
then maybe you can track the man.

1830
01:52:16,126 --> 01:52:19,084
So, I remember you thought
that Zodiac was military,

1831
01:52:19,084 --> 01:52:22,840
so I went to every base library
and I got a list of every person

1832
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:26,798
who's ever checked out these books
and that's when I found this.

1833
01:52:31,546 --> 01:52:34,042
-Missing.
-It means they were stolen.

1834
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:38,504
So, almost every book on ciphers
was stolen from the Presidio Library?

1835
01:52:38,504 --> 01:52:41,126
And the Oakland Army Terminal Library.

1836
01:52:43,924 --> 01:52:48,462
Somebody didn't want a record
of ever having checked out these books.

1837
01:52:48,462 --> 01:52:50,084
Who are you again?

1838
01:52:52,168 --> 01:52:53,840
I just wanna help.

1839
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,378
I can't allow you to help.

1840
01:52:59,378 --> 01:53:01,252
I can't discuss the case with you.

1841
01:53:01,252 --> 01:53:03,798
I can't give you information,
and I certainly couldn't tell you

1842
01:53:03,798 --> 01:53:06,000
to go see Ken Narlow in Napa.

1843
01:53:06,546 --> 01:53:07,966
N-A-R-L-O-W.

1844
01:53:17,924 --> 01:53:22,714
I'm sorry, Mr. Graysmith,
but we don't cooperate with writers.

1845
01:53:22,714 --> 01:53:25,504
Well, I'm not a writer, I'm a cartoonist.

1846
01:53:26,420 --> 01:53:28,714
-And Dave Toschi sent you?
-Yes.

1847
01:53:28,714 --> 01:53:30,798
-Why?
-Maybe he...

1848
01:53:30,798 --> 01:53:33,630
Maybe he thought
that I could do some good.

1849
01:53:34,336 --> 01:53:38,504
-What are you, some kind of boy scout?
-Eagle Scout, actually, first class.

1850
01:53:39,462 --> 01:53:42,672
Well, if you wanna do this,
don't let me stop you.

1851
01:53:43,924 --> 01:53:46,042
Better start with Vallejo, Jack Mulanax.

1852
01:53:46,966 --> 01:53:49,462
I understand what you're trying to do.

1853
01:53:49,462 --> 01:53:51,756
But this is an open police investigation.

1854
01:53:51,798 --> 01:53:53,966
I'm a friend of Dave Toschi's.

1855
01:53:53,966 --> 01:53:57,336
And he said
that you might be able to help.

1856
01:53:57,336 --> 01:54:00,294
I mean, the case is dead.
Zodiac's long gone.

1857
01:54:01,168 --> 01:54:03,378
He's yesterday's news, right?

1858
01:54:04,420 --> 01:54:06,210
That's what they say.

1859
01:54:07,126 --> 01:54:09,042
So, what's the harm?

1860
01:54:09,042 --> 01:54:10,546
<i>No pens, no paper.</i>

1861
01:54:11,042 --> 01:54:13,840
Anything that you see that's relevant,
you got to remember in your head.

1862
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:14,924
Okay.

1863
01:54:17,126 --> 01:54:18,546
Okay, here we go.

1864
01:54:18,546 --> 01:54:20,714
-Which one?
-All of them.

1865
01:54:20,714 --> 01:54:23,504
And there's more in the next room.
They're all marked with these numbers.

1866
01:54:23,504 --> 01:54:24,798
243-146.

1867
01:54:24,798 --> 01:54:26,756
You don't smoke, do you?

1868
01:54:26,756 --> 01:54:28,882
Once. In high school.

1869
01:54:32,252 --> 01:54:33,630
What's this?

1870
01:54:34,546 --> 01:54:35,882
Thank you.

1871
01:55:04,126 --> 01:55:06,126
<i>Man, you really creeped us out.</i>

1872
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
<i>"Nine millimeter.</i>

1873
01:55:15,546 --> 01:55:18,126
<i>"Said nothing and began firing."</i>

1874
01:55:26,924 --> 01:55:28,294
"Most Dangerous Game.

1875
01:55:28,294 --> 01:55:31,168
<i>"Do not eliminate this suspect</i>
<i>because of handwriting.</i>

1876
01:55:31,168 --> 01:55:33,294
<i>"Not because of handwriting.</i>

1877
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:35,924
"Darlene's sister, Linda.

1878
01:55:35,924 --> 01:55:38,630
"It was all just deep breathing. George.

1879
01:55:39,210 --> 01:55:42,000
"It was a strange man. George.
Strange man."

1880
01:55:42,966 --> 01:55:44,630
Thank you so much.

1881
01:55:46,504 --> 01:55:48,504
Oh, briefcase. Oh, thanks.

1882
01:55:51,210 --> 01:55:53,840
-Hey, Jack.
-Hey, Bawart.

1883
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:55,756
-Who's that?
-That's Graysmith.

1884
01:55:55,756 --> 01:55:59,042
Some cartoonist.
Thinks he's gonna solve the Zodiac.

1885
01:56:00,756 --> 01:56:02,084
Well, good for him.

1886
01:56:32,504 --> 01:56:34,882
-Thank you for meeting me, Inspector.
-No. We're not meeting, Robert.

1887
01:56:34,882 --> 01:56:36,504
We're just two guys
who happen to be sitting

1888
01:56:36,504 --> 01:56:37,756
on the same bench at the same time.

1889
01:56:37,756 --> 01:56:40,294
I've got five minutes.
I've got to get back to the Hall.

1890
01:56:40,294 --> 01:56:43,126
Okay. As far as you know,
did anyone ever get in touch

1891
01:56:43,126 --> 01:56:44,924
with Mike Mageau
during your investigation

1892
01:56:44,924 --> 01:56:47,504
-and show him suspect photos?
-Why?

1893
01:56:47,504 --> 01:56:50,000
Well, he's the only surviving victim
who ever saw Zodiac without a mask.

1894
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,462
No, I mean, why are you asking me?

1895
01:56:51,462 --> 01:56:53,420
Mageau and Darlene,
that's Vallejo's case.

1896
01:56:53,420 --> 01:56:56,294
Paul Stine is mine.
You've got four minutes now.

1897
01:56:56,294 --> 01:56:58,714
Darlene Ferrin was being followed.

1898
01:56:58,714 --> 01:57:00,546
Now, I know Mulanax says
that they already found this guy,

1899
01:57:00,546 --> 01:57:01,672
a George Waters?

1900
01:57:01,672 --> 01:57:03,546
But he also said
that she had a lot of admirers

1901
01:57:03,546 --> 01:57:05,294
who would come to
the restaurant where she worked.

1902
01:57:05,294 --> 01:57:07,000
-She was popular.
<i>-Very.</i>

1903
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,756
Yeah. So...

1904
01:57:08,756 --> 01:57:10,756
She and her husband,
they move into their new house,

1905
01:57:10,756 --> 01:57:12,504
and one night they throw
this painting party.

1906
01:57:12,504 --> 01:57:13,714
And what's a painting party?

1907
01:57:13,714 --> 01:57:15,798
It's a party where people come
and help you paint.

1908
01:57:15,798 --> 01:57:16,966
Sounds like a terrible party.

1909
01:57:16,966 --> 01:57:20,840
Well, supposedly,
somebody who's not Waters shows up.

1910
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:22,840
And Darlene is terrified of him.

1911
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:24,672
So you think that Darlene knew Zodiac?

1912
01:57:24,672 --> 01:57:29,210
And if Zodiac knew Darlene,
then maybe Mageau knows Zodiac.

1913
01:57:29,210 --> 01:57:31,168
Maybe. But Mageau's gone.

1914
01:57:31,168 --> 01:57:32,882
So if you wanna connect
Darlene to Zodiac,

1915
01:57:32,882 --> 01:57:34,378
you're gonna have to find another way.

1916
01:57:34,378 --> 01:57:35,798
I have another way.

1917
01:57:35,798 --> 01:57:37,504
Phone calls the night
of Darlene's murder.

1918
01:57:37,504 --> 01:57:40,714
-Yeah, Zodiac called the police.
-No, Dave, there were four other calls.

1919
01:57:40,714 --> 01:57:43,084
There were two to Darlene's house,
one to Darlene's brother-in-law,

1920
01:57:43,084 --> 01:57:45,504
and one to Darlene's father-in-law.
Just heavy breathing.

1921
01:57:45,504 --> 01:57:47,462
They started around 1:30 a.m. ,

1922
01:57:47,462 --> 01:57:51,210
and this was before anyone in the family
knew that Darlene had been shot.

1923
01:57:51,210 --> 01:57:53,420
-This was in the Vallejo files?
-Yeah.

1924
01:57:53,420 --> 01:57:54,546
God damn it.

1925
01:57:54,546 --> 01:57:56,378
It's got to be more
than just a coincidence, right?

1926
01:57:56,378 --> 01:57:59,336
I mean, somebody doesn't just randomly
prank phone call a victim's entire family

1927
01:57:59,336 --> 01:58:01,504
90 minutes after they were shot.

1928
01:58:01,504 --> 01:58:03,672
So, either Zodiac shoots
a random couple,

1929
01:58:03,672 --> 01:58:05,252
then he recognizes Darlene...

1930
01:58:05,252 --> 01:58:07,378
Or Darlene was shot on purpose.

1931
01:58:07,378 --> 01:58:10,588
Either way,
Zodiac had to have known Darlene.

1932
01:58:12,462 --> 01:58:14,210
That's good, Robert.

1933
01:58:14,714 --> 01:58:18,000
So, I can't find Mageau,
so maybe I can find Darlene's sister.

1934
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
And maybe she can tell me
who this mystery man is.

1935
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,840
Try that. I've got to go. She's very cute.

1936
01:58:26,714 --> 01:58:28,336
You know,

1937
01:58:28,336 --> 01:58:31,798
it's interesting that you should mention
Zodiac calling people at home.

1938
01:58:31,798 --> 01:58:33,336
He did that in San Francisco once.

1939
01:58:33,336 --> 01:58:34,924
What? Who did he call?

1940
01:58:34,924 --> 01:58:38,000
I can't tell you.
That's privileged information.

1941
01:58:38,630 --> 01:58:40,840
But maybe Melvin Belli could.

1942
01:58:43,462 --> 01:58:45,042
Melvin Belli.

1943
01:58:45,924 --> 01:58:48,294
How do I get to Melvin Belli?

1944
01:58:48,294 --> 01:58:51,420
-He should be along soon.
-Oh, that's all right.

1945
01:58:51,420 --> 01:58:53,882
I've really...
I've only been waiting two hours, so...

1946
01:58:53,882 --> 01:58:55,798
He's usually not this late.

1947
01:58:55,798 --> 01:58:58,630
Oh, cookies. Thank you.
These look great.

1948
01:58:59,420 --> 01:59:03,420
-You are here on business?
-I'm writing a book about the Zodiac.

1949
01:59:03,420 --> 01:59:06,462
I remember that. I spoke to him.

1950
01:59:06,462 --> 01:59:11,168
-You mean to Mr. Belli about the case?
-No, to the Zodiac when he called.

1951
01:59:11,168 --> 01:59:14,546
He said he had to kill
because it was his birthday.

1952
01:59:14,546 --> 01:59:17,882
He said it... Wait.
He said it was his birthday?

1953
01:59:17,924 --> 01:59:20,462
Yes. You want something to drink?

1954
01:59:21,462 --> 01:59:25,504
-When was this?
-Oh, so many years ago.

1955
01:59:27,168 --> 01:59:29,840
Mr. Belli was away for Christmas.

1956
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:31,168
Gone for a week.

1957
01:59:31,168 --> 01:59:33,630
The Zodiac called,
wanting to talk to him.

1958
01:59:33,630 --> 01:59:35,420
I said, "He is not here."

1959
01:59:35,420 --> 01:59:38,420
He said, "I have to kill.
Today is my birthday."

1960
01:59:38,420 --> 01:59:40,462
And then he hangs up.

1961
01:59:40,462 --> 01:59:42,042
Then the letter arrived.

1962
01:59:42,042 --> 01:59:46,210
So, the call came
before the letter of December 20th.

1963
01:59:46,210 --> 01:59:48,210
Mr. Belli was gone for a week?

1964
01:59:48,210 --> 01:59:52,084
He came back on Christmas.
Not a good day to work.

1965
01:59:52,084 --> 01:59:54,042
So, he left on the 18th.

1966
01:59:55,210 --> 01:59:56,756
Is that helpful?

1967
01:59:56,756 --> 01:59:58,294
She said it was his birthday.

1968
01:59:58,294 --> 02:00:02,210
<i>Well, you'd have to confirm that,</i>
<i>now wouldn't you?</i>

1969
02:00:02,210 --> 02:00:03,714
How?

1970
02:00:03,714 --> 02:00:06,924
<i>Well, I never spoke to her,</i>
<i>but maybe my partner did.</i>

1971
02:00:06,924 --> 02:00:09,840
-How do I get a hold of him?
<i>-You don't. Bill wanted out of this.</i>

1972
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:12,210
<i>As far as I’m concerned,</i>
<i>he should stay out.</i>

1973
02:00:12,210 --> 02:00:13,588
How do I confirm it?

1974
02:00:13,588 --> 02:00:16,210
<i>Well, if my partner</i>
<i>did talk to someone from Justice,</i>

1975
02:00:16,210 --> 02:00:17,882
<i>then they would've had</i>
<i>to put that in a report.</i>

1976
02:00:17,882 --> 02:00:20,294
<i>That's standard procedure.</i>

1977
02:00:20,294 --> 02:00:22,462
-Okay.
<i>-Mel Nicolai.</i>

1978
02:00:22,462 --> 02:00:24,504
-Thank you.
<i>-Goodbye.</i>

1979
02:00:24,504 --> 02:00:26,756
I just need to confirm a date.

1980
02:00:26,756 --> 02:00:28,210
-Mr. Graysmith...
-I've narrowed it down

1981
02:00:28,210 --> 02:00:30,588
between the 18th and the 20th
of December, and I just need...

1982
02:00:30,588 --> 02:00:33,966
Okay, I'll play.
Let's say this phone call did take place.

1983
02:00:33,966 --> 02:00:35,504
Let's say it really was Zodiac.

1984
02:00:35,504 --> 02:00:38,378
Why would he volunteer
the day he was born?

1985
02:00:38,378 --> 02:00:40,630
Plus, nobody died on December 18th,

1986
02:00:40,630 --> 02:00:43,504
just like nobody died over the weekend
when he was gonna kill a dozen people,

1987
02:00:43,504 --> 02:00:45,966
or when he was gonna
shoot school kids or blow up buses.

1988
02:00:45,966 --> 02:00:47,420
He's a liar, Mr. Graysmith.

1989
02:00:47,420 --> 02:00:49,168
What if he made a mistake?

1990
02:00:49,210 --> 02:00:51,336
What if he wasn't lying?
What if it was him on the phone?

1991
02:00:51,336 --> 02:00:53,798
He didn't expect to pick it up,
a nice person to pick up.

1992
02:00:53,798 --> 02:00:55,210
What if? What if? What if?

1993
02:00:55,210 --> 02:00:58,672
Look, off the record,
Bill Armstrong checked this out.

1994
02:00:58,672 --> 02:01:01,378
We took this very seriously.

1995
02:01:01,378 --> 02:01:04,714
None of the suspects had the
same birthday as this phantom caller.

1996
02:01:04,714 --> 02:01:06,924
Bill Armstrong.

1997
02:01:12,462 --> 02:01:14,504
Can I give you a piece of advice?

1998
02:01:14,504 --> 02:01:16,168
You're looking in the wrong place.

1999
02:01:16,168 --> 02:01:19,336
Handwriting, fingerprints,
that's what this whole thing's about.

2000
02:01:19,336 --> 02:01:20,672
Stick to the evidence.

2001
02:01:21,714 --> 02:01:22,798
Hi.

2002
02:01:31,084 --> 02:01:34,210
-Hey. How was your day?
-Long.

2003
02:01:39,630 --> 02:01:41,126
Who's Sherwood Morrill?

2004
02:01:41,126 --> 02:01:44,000
He's a handwriting expert
in Sacramento.

2005
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:45,210
He called.

2006
02:01:45,210 --> 02:01:47,420
He said he can meet you
tomorrow morning at 7:00.

2007
02:01:47,420 --> 02:01:48,798
Oh, great.

2008
02:01:48,798 --> 02:01:51,672
-So you're taking off work?
-Just an hour.

2009
02:01:53,420 --> 02:01:55,546
Sacramento's two hours away.

2010
02:01:56,672 --> 02:01:58,294
-Really?
-Yes.

2011
02:01:59,042 --> 02:02:00,672
What's this?

2012
02:02:00,672 --> 02:02:03,378
Oh, that's that article.

2013
02:02:03,378 --> 02:02:07,084
"Robert Graysmith has quietly been
shopping his book about the Zodiac."

2014
02:02:07,084 --> 02:02:08,252
Yeah.

2015
02:02:08,252 --> 02:02:11,000
It talks all about you
researching Zodiac.

2016
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:12,504
Well, that's what the article's about.

2017
02:02:12,504 --> 02:02:15,042
I'm not so sure that's something
we want people to know about.

2018
02:02:15,042 --> 02:02:16,210
Why? Are you embarrassed?

2019
02:02:16,210 --> 02:02:19,420
Robert, what's the one thing
we know about Zodiac?

2020
02:02:20,042 --> 02:02:21,336
He reads the Chronicle.

2021
02:02:21,336 --> 02:02:23,882
Yeah, but he's never
gonna read Herb Caen.

2022
02:02:28,504 --> 02:02:30,924
-Hello.
<i>-Mr. Graysmith?</i>

2023
02:02:30,924 --> 02:02:33,588
<i>The Robert Graysmith</i>
<i>mentioned in the paper today?</i>

2024
02:02:33,588 --> 02:02:36,714
-Yeah?
<i>-I can tell you who the Zodiac is.</i>

2025
02:02:40,504 --> 02:02:41,630
Who is this?

2026
02:02:41,630 --> 02:02:43,882
<i>The Zodiac Killer</i>
<i>is obsessed with movies.</i>

2027
02:02:43,882 --> 02:02:46,672
<i>He recorded his murders on film.</i>

2028
02:02:46,672 --> 02:02:50,126
<i>I tried to tell the police,</i>
<i>but they wouldn't follow through on it.</i>

2029
02:02:50,126 --> 02:02:53,168
<i>There's a man you need to find.</i>
<i>His name is Bob Vaughn.</i>

2030
02:02:53,168 --> 02:02:55,840
-Pen, pen.
<i>-V-A-U-G-H-N.</i>

2031
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:58,042
<i>He's a friend of the Zodiac's.</i>

2032
02:02:58,042 --> 02:03:00,294
<i>Mr. Vaughn does not know</i>
<i>his friend is a killer,</i>

2033
02:03:00,294 --> 02:03:03,000
<i>and he is storing</i>
<i>some film canisters for him.</i>

2034
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,798
<i>In these canisters is the evidence.</i>

2035
02:03:04,798 --> 02:03:08,252
Okay, yeah, friend? Who is this friend?

2036
02:03:08,252 --> 02:03:10,000
<i>You have quite enough to get started.</i>

2037
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:11,840
Oh, please.

2038
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:15,168
<i>The Zodiac's name is Rick Marshall.</i>

2039
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:20,882
Your toast is burning.

2040
02:03:21,882 --> 02:03:26,924
We choose at some point in our lives
how to physically construct each letter.

2041
02:03:27,672 --> 02:03:30,000
Once we lock that into our brains,

2042
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,378
our handwriting may change
over the years,

2043
02:03:32,378 --> 02:03:35,168
but the moves themselves
remain unaltered.

2044
02:03:35,168 --> 02:03:36,672
-Understand?
-Yes.

2045
02:03:38,252 --> 02:03:40,210
Except Zodiac's doesn't.

2046
02:03:41,798 --> 02:03:43,756
Specifically with his "K."

2047
02:03:44,966 --> 02:03:47,966
In his first letters,
he executed the "K" with two strokes.

2048
02:03:47,966 --> 02:03:49,546
Later letters, he did them with three.

2049
02:03:49,546 --> 02:03:51,924
-Why?
-We don't know.

2050
02:03:51,924 --> 02:03:53,966
Excuse me, I've got to spray this.

2051
02:03:53,966 --> 02:03:57,168
How many suspects
were cleared through handwriting?

2052
02:03:57,168 --> 02:03:58,714
All of them.

2053
02:03:58,714 --> 02:04:02,294
Also the print in the cab.
No match was ever found.

2054
02:04:02,294 --> 02:04:06,420
Is there any way that someone
could beat a handwriting test?

2055
02:04:06,420 --> 02:04:07,504
No.

2056
02:04:07,504 --> 02:04:10,714
Whoever the Zodiac is,
he's not someone I cleared.

2057
02:04:11,630 --> 02:04:15,210
About a month ago, a man showed up
on my doorstep very distraught.

2058
02:04:15,210 --> 02:04:17,294
His name was Wallace Penny.

2059
02:04:18,210 --> 02:04:20,588
He said he knew who the Zodiac was.

2060
02:04:20,588 --> 02:04:22,714
Gave me a name.

2061
02:04:22,714 --> 02:04:25,000
Rick. Rick somebody.

2062
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,504
-Rick Marshall?
-Yeah.

2063
02:04:27,504 --> 02:04:30,126
I think that the man
who you talked to called me, too.

2064
02:04:30,126 --> 02:04:32,840
After he left, then I checked my files.

2065
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:34,588
I never cleared a Rick Marshall.

2066
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:43,000
Hello?

2067
02:04:48,126 --> 02:04:49,882
Hello? Who is this?

2068
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:01,966
It's the wrong number.

2069
02:05:07,882 --> 02:05:11,042
Does the name Rick Marshall
mean anything to you?

2070
02:05:12,042 --> 02:05:14,168
What are you after?

2071
02:05:14,168 --> 02:05:15,336
What do you got?

2072
02:05:15,378 --> 02:05:19,630
Hypothetically, you just named
my favorite suspect in the whole case.

2073
02:05:20,756 --> 02:05:22,336
This is off the record.

2074
02:05:22,336 --> 02:05:24,756
Couple years back,
I was trying to get Marshall's prints.

2075
02:05:24,756 --> 02:05:26,588
I handed him a photo.

2076
02:05:26,588 --> 02:05:29,084
He looks at it. He's about to give it back
and he stops and he says,

2077
02:05:29,084 --> 02:05:31,588
"My goodness,
I got fingerprints all over this."

2078
02:05:31,588 --> 02:05:33,462
And he wipes them off.

2079
02:05:34,168 --> 02:05:35,966
Why didn't you test him for handwriting?

2080
02:05:35,966 --> 02:05:38,714
Because when they finally
did run his prints,

2081
02:05:38,714 --> 02:05:41,084
they cleared him
against the one in Stine's cab.

2082
02:05:41,084 --> 02:05:43,294
-So, then, it's not him.
-Maybe yes, maybe no.

2083
02:05:43,294 --> 02:05:45,420
No. What do you mean?

2084
02:05:45,420 --> 02:05:47,882
Zodiac left gloves behind at the scene.

2085
02:05:47,882 --> 02:05:50,000
If he had the foresight
to bring gloves with him

2086
02:05:50,042 --> 02:05:52,126
how the hell's he gonna
accidentally leave a print behind?

2087
02:05:52,126 --> 02:05:54,210
But it was in the victim's blood.

2088
02:05:54,210 --> 02:05:55,672
Could have been one of the bystanders,

2089
02:05:55,672 --> 02:05:58,126
or a cop just reaches out,
boom, false print.

2090
02:05:58,126 --> 02:06:00,588
Yeah, but that print
disqualified 2,500 suspects.

2091
02:06:00,588 --> 02:06:02,000
Which is why we also used handwriting.

2092
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,420
But not for Rick Marshall.

2093
02:06:03,420 --> 02:06:06,588
SFPD saw a handwritten sign
in the window of his house.

2094
02:06:06,588 --> 02:06:10,504
Decided it looked nothing
like the Z letters, so they just moved on.

2095
02:06:10,504 --> 02:06:12,840
How do they know
that Rick Marshall wrote the sign?

2096
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:14,126
My thoughts exactly.

2097
02:06:15,126 --> 02:06:18,882
Rick Marshall was a Navy man.
He received code training.

2098
02:06:18,882 --> 02:06:21,420
He was also a projectionist
at a silent film theater.

2099
02:06:21,420 --> 02:06:23,630
Well, then, how do I get copies
of Rick Marshall's handwriting?

2100
02:06:23,630 --> 02:06:27,588
Three ways.
One, get a warrant, which you can't.

2101
02:06:27,588 --> 02:06:29,840
Two, get him to volunteer,
which he won't.

2102
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:31,840
Yeah, and three?

2103
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:33,588
Get creative.

2104
02:06:33,588 --> 02:06:36,420
<i>I don't know what to tell you.</i>
<i>You get it, I’ll analyze it.</i>

2105
02:06:36,420 --> 02:06:37,882
<i>Beyond that, you're on your own.</i>

2106
02:06:37,882 --> 02:06:40,420
Okay, what about
the guy who came to see you,

2107
02:06:40,420 --> 02:06:41,924
the one who called me?

2108
02:06:41,924 --> 02:06:44,462
<i>You mean Wallace Penny?</i>

2109
02:06:44,462 --> 02:06:46,630
Yeah. Did he leave a number?

2110
02:06:55,924 --> 02:06:59,294
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Hi, this is Robert Graysmith.

2111
02:06:59,294 --> 02:07:00,378
<i>How did you find me?</i>

2112
02:07:00,378 --> 02:07:02,546
I need a sample
of Rick Marshall's handwriting.

2113
02:07:02,546 --> 02:07:03,924
<i>I told you. Vaughn is who...</i>

2114
02:07:03,924 --> 02:07:07,000
Mr. Penny,
if Rick Marshall is the Zodiac,

2115
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,588
I need a sample of his handwriting
to confirm it.

2116
02:07:09,588 --> 02:07:11,210
Can you help me or not?

2117
02:07:12,882 --> 02:07:17,630
<i>Rick used to draw movie posters</i>
<i>for the theater Vaughn worked at.</i>

2118
02:07:17,630 --> 02:07:19,588
<i>-I’ll send one down.</i>
-Thank you.

2119
02:07:29,546 --> 02:07:32,042
-I'll need to see more samples.
-Yeah, but is it...

2120
02:07:32,042 --> 02:07:34,672
It's as close as I've ever seen.
We have to tread lightly here.

2121
02:07:34,672 --> 02:07:37,210
We're talking about
implicating this man as the Zodiac.

2122
02:07:37,210 --> 02:07:40,294
I can get more. I'll just find Vaughn
and I'll track down Linda.

2123
02:07:40,294 --> 02:07:42,378
I mean, Linda is Darlene's sister.

2124
02:07:42,378 --> 02:07:45,168
I've been to the DMV,
and I talked to her parents,

2125
02:07:45,168 --> 02:07:48,378
but still, nobody knows
where to find her.

2126
02:07:48,378 --> 02:07:52,966
Mr. Graysmith, most of the writing
matches the exemplar.

2127
02:07:52,966 --> 02:07:56,084
In a way, though, it's the part that
doesn't match that scares me the most.

2128
02:07:56,084 --> 02:07:58,588
-What do you mean?
-Well, on the poster,

2129
02:07:58,588 --> 02:08:01,798
the one letter that absolutely,
positively does not match

<i>that the man</i>

<i>the Zodiac makes no overt threats</i>
<i>against the citizenry,</i>

02:09:48,798 --> 02:09:50,378

San Francisco Chronicle columnist
<i>Armistead Maupin says</i>

2174
02:10:12,336 --> 02:10:15,000
<i>that he thinks not only</i>
<i>is this new letter a forgery,</i>

2175
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,042
<i>but it was written by the very man</i>

2176
02:10:17,042 --> 02:10:20,882
<i>trusted to hunt down this killer,</i>
<i>David Toschi.</i>

2177
02:10:20,882 --> 02:10:24,672
<i>Maupin, a very well-respected author,</i>
<i>has gone on record saying</i>

2178
02:10:24,672 --> 02:10:29,378
<i>that he believes Toschi wrote the letter</i>
<i>to drum up publicity for himself.</i>

2179
02:10:29,378 --> 02:10:32,546
Maupin used David
as a character in his column.

2180
02:10:32,546 --> 02:10:34,546
David got a kick out of it

2181
02:10:34,546 --> 02:10:36,630
and so he wrote
a couple of anonymous letters

2182
02:10:36,630 --> 02:10:38,630
asking for the character
to be brought back.

2183
02:10:38,630 --> 02:10:41,756
<i>It was like</i>
<i>writing fan mail to himself. That's all.</i>

2184
02:10:41,756 --> 02:10:44,042
<i>But David did not write that letter.</i>

2185
02:10:44,042 --> 02:10:47,294
No, I'm sure that he didn't.
And I'm sure that this will all blow over.

2186
02:10:47,294 --> 02:10:48,714
<i>Blow over?</i>

2187
02:10:48,714 --> 02:10:51,042
They kicked him out of Homicide.

2188
02:10:51,042 --> 02:10:54,378
They made him give his handwriting
like some common criminal.

2189
02:10:54,378 --> 02:10:56,756
-May I talk to him?
<i>-No.</i>

2190
02:10:57,798 --> 02:10:59,084
Okay, can you just ask him

2191
02:10:59,084 --> 02:11:01,546
if he ever investigated
a man named Rick Marshall?

2192
02:11:01,546 --> 02:11:03,420
Is that all you can think about?

2193
02:11:03,420 --> 02:11:06,840
Mr. Graysmith,
Maupin works at your paper. We trust...

2194
02:11:12,630 --> 02:11:14,084
This girl, she wants music lessons?

2195
02:11:14,084 --> 02:11:15,588
Dave! Dave!

2196
02:11:18,042 --> 02:11:20,336
I'll catch up to you.

2197
02:11:20,336 --> 02:11:22,672
You stop calling my house.
Do you understand me?

2198
02:11:22,672 --> 02:11:24,462
I just need your help to find Linda.

2199
02:11:24,462 --> 02:11:26,504
-Jesus.
-Look, two seconds.

2200
02:11:28,462 --> 02:11:30,966
Look, we've been
running handwriting samples.

2201
02:11:30,966 --> 02:11:33,294
-Who's we?
-Sherwood and I.

2202
02:11:33,294 --> 02:11:34,504
Sherwood?

2203
02:11:34,504 --> 02:11:36,714
Sherwood who was fired
from Questioned Documents?

2204
02:11:36,714 --> 02:11:38,378
Sherwood who drinks
like Paul Avery now?

2205
02:11:38,378 --> 02:11:40,966
-He retired.
-Is that what he told you?

2206
02:11:40,966 --> 02:11:45,168
-What, are you saying he's wrong?
-I'm saying stop calling my house.

2207
02:11:45,756 --> 02:11:47,378
-We ran them on Rick Marshall.
-No, Robert.

2208
02:11:47,378 --> 02:11:48,798
No, I know you don't think it's him.

2209
02:11:48,798 --> 02:11:50,336
I mean, no, I am not having
this conversation.

2210
02:11:50,336 --> 02:11:53,252
But I think that Marshall knew Darlene,
and I can't talk to Mageau or Linda,

2211
02:11:53,252 --> 02:11:54,336
so I'm gonna talk to Bob Vaughn.

2212
02:11:54,336 --> 02:11:55,672
-Robert. Robert, stop it!
-What?

2213
02:11:55,672 --> 02:11:58,042
Okay, the Rick Marshalls
of this world will suck you dry.

2214
02:11:58,042 --> 02:11:59,084
They're blind alleys.

2215
02:11:59,084 --> 02:12:01,672
But he said he wasn't gonna announce
his murders anymore, Dave.

2216
02:12:01,672 --> 02:12:02,840
He was just gonna do them.

2217
02:12:02,840 --> 02:12:05,882
Do you know what the chances
of us arresting someone are now?

2218
02:12:05,882 --> 02:12:10,084
Too much time has gone by, okay?
Too much of the evidence is lost.

2219
02:12:10,084 --> 02:12:13,336
People get old, Robert. They forget.

2220
02:12:13,336 --> 02:12:17,588
Now, I have been a cop for 25 years.
Murder police for 12.

2221
02:12:17,588 --> 02:12:19,966
-What do you do for a living?
-You know what I do for a living.

2222
02:12:19,966 --> 02:12:22,294
-You're a cartoonist.
-So what are you saying?

2223
02:12:22,336 --> 02:12:25,462
I am saying Zodiac was my job.
It is not yours.

2224
02:12:28,672 --> 02:12:31,126
-He's still out there, Dave.
-No, Robert. I am through with this.

2225
02:12:31,126 --> 02:12:33,042
I am through with you.

2226
02:12:39,336 --> 02:12:41,924
What about September 26, 1970?

2227
02:12:41,924 --> 02:12:45,504
-Okay, which one was that?
-The Lake Tahoe nurse goes missing.

2228
02:12:48,462 --> 02:12:49,924
One day before the vernal equinox.

2229
02:12:49,924 --> 02:12:51,924
-Dad?
-Yeah. Mark that.

2230
02:12:51,924 --> 02:12:55,672
Got another one. June 19th, 1971.

2231
02:12:55,672 --> 02:12:58,462
That's got to be
near the summer solstice.

2232
02:13:00,798 --> 02:13:02,168
Oh, guys.

2233
02:13:02,168 --> 02:13:05,210
Don't tell Mom about
our special project, okay?

2234
02:13:05,714 --> 02:13:09,336
How come you and Mom
don't sleep in the same bed anymore?

2235
02:13:12,924 --> 02:13:13,966
Hello.

<i>Yeah. How can I help?</i>

2239

with the Zodiac's timeline.

2241
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:31,336
More often than not, each cycle
since '69 corresponds with an attack

2242
02:13:31,336 --> 02:13:34,294
or with one of the letters,
or an unsolved homicide.

2243

-Dad?

Hey, we found Linda.
She's in jail. Isn't that great?

2258
02:14:28,210 --> 02:14:29,462
Why'd you do it?

2259
02:14:29,462 --> 02:14:30,966
Because she'll be able to identify Rick...

2260
02:14:30,966 --> 02:14:33,714
-What are you talking about?
-You went on TV.

2261
02:14:34,294 --> 02:14:36,042
You put yourself out there

Oh, hon, you're being paranoid.

Oh, hon, you're being paranoid.

Nobody.

2266
02:14:44,042 --> 02:14:45,798
What's it gonna take
for you to be done with this?

2267
02:14:45,798 --> 02:14:48,798
I can't talk about this now.
I have to go see Bob Vaughn.

2268
02:14:48,798 --> 02:14:52,252
Well, that's too bad,
because we're gonna talk about this.

2269

And when is it gonna be finished?

2270
02:14:54,672 --> 02:14:56,588
When you catch him?
When you arrest him?

2271

-Be serious.
-I am serious.

2272

I need to know who he is.

2273

I need to stand there,

2274

I need to look him in the eye
and I need to know that it's him.

2275
02:15:13,252 --> 02:15:15,630
Is that more important
than your family's safety?

2276
02:15:15,630 --> 02:15:17,126
Of course not.

2277
02:15:19,084 --> 02:15:21,504
Why? Why do you need to do this?

2278
02:15:23,378 --> 02:15:24,462
Why?

2279
02:15:26,420 --> 02:15:28,504
Because nobody else will.

2280
02:15:28,504 --> 02:15:30,546
That's not good enough.

2281
02:15:30,546 --> 02:15:32,420
Are you done? Can I go?

2282
02:15:47,714 --> 02:15:49,840
-Mr. Vaughn?
-Mr. Graysmith?

2283
02:15:49,882 --> 02:15:51,000
-Yes.
-Hi.

2284
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:52,420
You needed to speak to me?

2285
02:15:52,420 --> 02:15:54,924
Yes. There's a coffee shop
right on the corner.

2286
02:15:54,924 --> 02:15:58,084
-Why don't we just go to my home?
-Oh, I don't wanna put you out.

2287
02:15:58,084 --> 02:16:00,084
It's no trouble at all.

2288
02:16:00,084 --> 02:16:02,672
-Where are you parked?
-Just right there.

2289
02:16:02,672 --> 02:16:06,042
-You can follow me.
-Oh. Okay.

2290
02:16:24,714 --> 02:16:26,336
Watch your step.

2291
02:16:27,798 --> 02:16:29,504
Come in.

2292
02:16:30,882 --> 02:16:34,084
-Very nice house.
-Oh, thank you.

2293
02:16:34,084 --> 02:16:36,042
It's very rustic.

2294
02:16:36,042 --> 02:16:39,294
-Can I take your jacket?
-No, thank you, I'm fine.

2295
02:16:39,294 --> 02:16:41,294
Okay. This way, please.

2296
02:16:44,084 --> 02:16:45,924
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

2297
02:16:45,924 --> 02:16:48,546
-How about some tea?
-Oh, no, I'm all right.

2298
02:16:48,546 --> 02:16:50,000
-You sure?
-Yes.

2299
02:16:50,882 --> 02:16:54,714
I wanted to ask you about a film
that the Avenue may have played

2300
02:16:54,714 --> 02:16:56,714
while you were the organist there.

2301
02:16:56,714 --> 02:16:59,084
<i>The Most Dangerous Game?</i>

2302
02:16:59,084 --> 02:17:02,546
Oh, it's a classic. R KO. 1932.

2303
02:17:02,546 --> 02:17:07,336
Fay Wray, Joel McCrea, Leslie Banks.
We've run that picture many times.

2304
02:17:07,336 --> 02:17:08,882
In '68, '69?

2305
02:17:10,462 --> 02:17:12,756
I'd have to check my records. Why?

2306
02:17:12,756 --> 02:17:14,882
Do you remember the Zodiac?

2307
02:17:17,084 --> 02:17:19,462
This is about Rick Marshall, isn't it?

2308
02:17:19,462 --> 02:17:22,966
-He was a projectionist there, right?
-For a time, yes.

2309
02:17:22,966 --> 02:17:27,084
But I have no occasion
to correspond with him these days.

2310
02:17:27,084 --> 02:17:29,672
Okay. Well, there is a connection

2311
02:17:29,672 --> 02:17:32,546
between one of the Zodiac attacks
and that film.

2312
02:17:32,546 --> 02:17:34,294
You mean the symbol?

2313
02:17:35,546 --> 02:17:36,756
Hold on.

2314
02:17:37,294 --> 02:17:41,420
The Zodiac symbol on film.
It's on the countdown.

2315
02:17:45,294 --> 02:17:48,000
It's trimmed off each reel
before it's shown,

2316
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,630
but it always arrives with it.

2317
02:17:50,630 --> 02:17:52,042
Right there.

2318
02:17:52,630 --> 02:17:56,336
The first time I saw it in the papers,
I thought about that.

2319
02:17:57,168 --> 02:17:58,840
We got a tip

2320
02:17:58,840 --> 02:18:02,882
that Rick left a film canister here
that he told you never to open.

2321
02:18:02,882 --> 02:18:06,000
A tip about a mysterious film canister?

2322
02:18:06,882 --> 02:18:08,210
Is it true?

2323
02:18:10,126 --> 02:18:11,336
Yes.

2324
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,420
-Did you open it?
-No.

2325
02:18:14,420 --> 02:18:18,714
-May I see it?
-Rick took it back in 1972.

2326
02:18:20,420 --> 02:18:25,294
This tip is how you got it in your head
that Rick is the Zodiac?

2327
02:18:25,294 --> 02:18:27,042
That and the poster.

2328
02:18:27,042 --> 02:18:28,420
The poster?

2329
02:18:30,336 --> 02:18:32,210
The poster that Rick drew.

2330
02:18:32,210 --> 02:18:35,504
The handwriting is the closest
that we have ever come to a match.

2331
02:18:35,504 --> 02:18:38,882
-Rick didn't draw any posters.
-No, he drew this one.

2332
02:18:38,882 --> 02:18:42,336
Mr. Graysmith, I do the posters myself.

2333
02:18:43,714 --> 02:18:45,588
That's my handwriting.

2334
02:18:53,840 --> 02:18:56,798
I won't take any more of your time.

2335
02:18:56,798 --> 02:19:02,294
Why don't I just go and find out
when we played that film?

2336
02:19:02,294 --> 02:19:03,840
Oh, that's all right.

2337
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:07,294
It's not a problem.
They're just down in the basement.

2338
02:19:09,084 --> 02:19:12,042
Not many people
have basements in California.

2339
02:19:14,714 --> 02:19:15,798
I do.

2340
02:19:17,966 --> 02:19:19,966
You coming, Mr. Graysmith?

2341
02:19:31,252 --> 02:19:34,966
The original studio one-sheets,
I always kept for myself.

2342
02:19:36,840 --> 02:19:39,462
The cheapo knock-offs
like you brought today

2343
02:19:39,462 --> 02:19:42,588
I end up tossing into the back alley.

2344
02:19:57,084 --> 02:19:58,588
'69.

2345
02:20:04,294 --> 02:20:05,630
You live alone?

2346
02:20:05,630 --> 02:20:11,504
Most Dangerous Game ran in May '69.

2347
02:20:11,504 --> 02:20:13,966
So, that would be about

2348
02:20:14,840 --> 02:20:18,168
nine weeks before
the first Zodiac letter, correct?

2349
02:20:21,042 --> 02:20:22,168
Yeah.

2350
02:20:26,630 --> 02:20:30,924
Do you think he saw the film
in our theater and was inspired?

2351
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,924
Are you sure
there's nobody else in the house?

2352
02:20:41,504 --> 02:20:44,210
Would you like
to go upstairs and check?

2353
02:20:44,924 --> 02:20:45,966
No.

2354
02:20:49,042 --> 02:20:51,630
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

2355
02:20:52,462 --> 02:20:53,966
You're welcome.

2356
02:21:15,210 --> 02:21:16,630
It's locked.

2357
02:21:27,462 --> 02:21:28,798
Thank you.

2358
02:21:31,924 --> 02:21:33,924
Good night, Mr. Graysmith!

2359
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:57,546
Two killers. Got to be two killers.
One has the...

2360
02:22:05,420 --> 02:22:06,588
Guys?

2361
02:22:40,126 --> 02:22:42,084
You've got five minutes.

2362
02:22:50,252 --> 02:22:51,420
Linda?

2363
02:22:52,546 --> 02:22:54,042
Hi, I'm Robert.

2364
02:22:58,000 --> 02:22:59,756
Did you get my note?

2365
02:23:00,672 --> 02:23:02,672
-What's this about?
-Zodiac.

2366
02:23:04,210 --> 02:23:05,462
Figures.

2367
02:23:06,798 --> 02:23:09,630
-You got the look.
-What look?

2368
02:23:09,630 --> 02:23:11,672
I didn't mean anything.

2369
02:23:12,924 --> 02:23:15,294
Tell me about this painting party.

2370
02:23:16,462 --> 02:23:19,084
I told the cops about that so long ago.

2371
02:23:22,546 --> 02:23:24,420
Darlene always had
a lot of boys around,

2372
02:23:24,420 --> 02:23:26,462
even though she was married.

2373
02:23:26,462 --> 02:23:28,546
And this one guy was weird, though.

2374
02:23:28,546 --> 02:23:31,924
He used to bring her presents
from Tijuana and...

2375
02:23:33,126 --> 02:23:35,840
I don't know why
she was friends with him.

2376
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:38,378
She once told me he'd killed somebody.

2377
02:23:38,378 --> 02:23:40,042
Really?

2378
02:23:40,042 --> 02:23:42,378
Yeah, I think maybe
when he was in the service.

2379
02:23:42,378 --> 02:23:44,420
-Navy?
-I think so.

2380
02:23:44,420 --> 02:23:46,714
Was he into movies?
Was he a movie buff?

2381
02:23:46,714 --> 02:23:49,714
I can tell you that
he was not into people.

2382
02:23:49,714 --> 02:23:51,126
The party Darlene threw,

2383
02:23:51,126 --> 02:23:54,126
people were supposed to
just show up and drink beer, help paint.

2384
02:23:54,126 --> 02:23:56,462
But this guy showed up in a suit,

2385
02:23:56,462 --> 02:23:59,504
and just sat in a chair
all by himself all night long.

2386
02:23:59,504 --> 02:24:01,042
Didn't talk to anyone.

2387
02:24:01,042 --> 02:24:03,000
And Darlene told me
to stay away from him.

2388
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:04,840
She was scared of him.

2389
02:24:07,084 --> 02:24:09,672
And a couple of weeks later,
she was dead.

2390
02:24:09,672 --> 02:24:12,126
I'm sorry. Do you remember his name?

2391
02:24:13,126 --> 02:24:17,084
I mean, it was short,
like a nickname, like Stan.

2392
02:24:17,084 --> 02:24:19,420
-Rick?
-No, I don't think so.

2393
02:24:20,294 --> 02:24:22,588
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

2394
02:24:22,588 --> 02:24:25,252
How can you be sure?
It was a long time ago. Think hard.

2395
02:24:25,252 --> 02:24:27,378
I am thinking hard.

2396
02:24:27,378 --> 02:24:28,798
It was Rick.

2397
02:24:29,798 --> 02:24:30,966
No, it wasn't.

2398
02:24:30,966 --> 02:24:33,462
-It was Rick. It was Rick Marshall.
-No.

2399
02:24:33,462 --> 02:24:35,252
Just say it!

2400
02:24:35,252 --> 02:24:37,126
It wasn't Rick.

2401
02:24:49,882 --> 02:24:51,210
It was Leigh.

2402
02:24:54,378 --> 02:24:56,924
-Leigh?
-Yeah, Leigh.

2403
02:24:58,252 --> 02:24:59,588
Sounds right.

2404
02:25:04,378 --> 02:25:07,294
Officer! I need you to let me in.

2405
02:25:07,294 --> 02:25:09,546
-Is this an emergency?
-No, I just need to see one file.

2406
02:25:09,546 --> 02:25:11,294
No, you need to come back
tomorrow morning.

2407
02:25:11,294 --> 02:25:13,588
-One file, just for one second.
-8:00 a.m. , when we're open.

2408
02:25:13,588 --> 02:25:15,336
Sergeant! Sergeant Mulanax!

2409
02:25:15,336 --> 02:25:17,882
Sergeant, I just need to see one file!

2410
02:25:17,882 --> 02:25:21,294
Just give me five minutes.
I know exactly where it is.

2411
02:25:22,252 --> 02:25:23,462
Please!

2412
02:25:36,798 --> 02:25:38,588
I shouldn't be talking to you.

2413
02:25:38,588 --> 02:25:40,588
-You got five minutes.
-Okay.

2414
02:25:42,840 --> 02:25:44,168
Here. Here.

2415
02:25:44,168 --> 02:25:48,042
Linda states that some of
Darlene's closest friends are Leigh,

2416
02:25:48,042 --> 02:25:51,126
who used to bring Darlene
presents from Tijuana.

2417
02:25:51,126 --> 02:25:53,126
-So what?
-He knew her.

2418
02:25:53,126 --> 02:25:54,924
Linda said Leigh. This is Leigh.

2419
02:25:54,924 --> 02:25:57,462
No. That's just one name in a file
that contains hundreds.

2420
02:25:57,462 --> 02:25:58,924
It's nothing.

2421
02:25:59,672 --> 02:26:01,882
-Dave Toschi...
-Agrees with me.

2422
02:26:02,378 --> 02:26:05,252
Our investigation
into this subject is over.

2423
02:26:08,252 --> 02:26:09,546
I'm sorry.

2424
02:26:18,672 --> 02:26:19,840
Hello.

2425
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:36,420
Who's there?

2426
02:26:39,882 --> 02:26:43,462
-You didn't return my calls.
-Oh, I've been kind of busy.

2427
02:26:43,462 --> 02:26:45,336
Yeah. I can see that.

2428
02:26:47,546 --> 02:26:49,420
How's the book coming?

2429
02:26:52,462 --> 02:26:54,462
I tried to send you these.

2430
02:26:55,546 --> 02:26:57,420
I called the Chron.

2431
02:26:57,420 --> 02:27:00,210
Well, I'm not a cartoonist anymore, so...

2432
02:27:01,756 --> 02:27:03,000
I heard.

2433
02:27:08,126 --> 02:27:10,756
When's the last time
you ate something?

2434
02:27:13,252 --> 02:27:15,420
Nothing makes sense anymore.

2435
02:27:18,084 --> 02:27:20,378
-Did it ever?
-Yeah, it did.

2436
02:27:21,840 --> 02:27:24,798
Robert, it was just the date
that didn't end.

2437
02:27:25,252 --> 02:27:27,042
You don't mean that.

2438
02:27:28,462 --> 02:27:29,672
A little.

2439
02:27:32,546 --> 02:27:34,420
The kids miss you.

2440
02:27:34,420 --> 02:27:37,546
-I can't have them see me like this.
-Neither can I.

2441
02:27:38,294 --> 02:27:40,420
So, do whatever you have to,

2442
02:27:41,378 --> 02:27:42,924
but finish this.

2443
02:28:10,462 --> 02:28:11,546
Dave!

2444
02:28:12,420 --> 02:28:14,042
Dave! It's Robert!

2445
02:28:16,210 --> 02:28:17,924
-Dave!
-Is he actually here?

2446
02:28:17,924 --> 02:28:19,672
I'm gonna kill him.

2447
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,630
I'm calling SFPD. Where's my gun?

2448
02:28:25,168 --> 02:28:26,420
Dave!

2449
02:28:26,420 --> 02:28:28,252
Robert! Go away!

2450
02:28:28,252 --> 02:28:30,336
Dave! He made a mistake!

2451
02:28:30,336 --> 02:28:32,378
-Get away from the window.
-I'll meet you around front.

2452
02:28:32,378 --> 02:28:33,882
No, you won't.

2453
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,336
-You have to hear this!
-No, I don't, Robert!

2454
02:28:37,336 --> 02:28:39,882
The birthday was the one time
that he was weak!

2455
02:28:39,882 --> 02:28:41,798
The one time
that he gave something away!

2456
02:28:41,798 --> 02:28:45,126
-Robert, I am calling the police.
-It's Arthur Leigh Allen!

2457
02:28:50,126 --> 02:28:52,504
Where did you get that name?

2458
02:28:52,504 --> 02:28:54,126
He called the Bellis' house.

2459
02:28:54,126 --> 02:28:56,462
December '69.
"I need to kill. Today's my birthday."

2460
02:28:56,462 --> 02:28:58,546
It was his birthday.

2461
02:28:58,546 --> 02:29:01,462
Arthur Leigh Allen
was born on December 18th.

2462
02:29:04,504 --> 02:29:05,924
Get in here.

2463
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,210
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

2464
02:29:13,168 --> 02:29:15,042
He wrote me, you know?

2465
02:29:15,714 --> 02:29:16,924
2,500 suspects,

2466
02:29:16,924 --> 02:29:20,546
the only one who ever wrote me
a letter was Leigh Allen.

2467
02:29:21,420 --> 02:29:23,252
They like to help, you know, sometimes.

2468
02:29:23,252 --> 02:29:25,042
Yes, Robert, I know.

2469
02:29:26,126 --> 02:29:28,966
He was arrested January 1975
for molestation.

2470
02:29:28,966 --> 02:29:30,966
He sent me that when he got out.

2471
02:29:30,966 --> 02:29:33,798
"Dear Dave, if I can ever be
of any help to you, just let me know.

2472
02:29:33,798 --> 02:29:35,714
"I'm sorry I wasn't your man."

2473
02:29:35,714 --> 02:29:37,378
And it's typewritten.

2474
02:29:37,378 --> 02:29:39,798
Using a typewriter is not a crime.

2475
02:29:41,210 --> 02:29:43,000
And he knew Darlene.

2476
02:29:44,378 --> 02:29:46,420
It's in the Vallejo files.

2477
02:29:51,588 --> 02:29:55,042
Mulanax said that
he was your favorite suspect.

2478
02:29:55,042 --> 02:29:59,042
That you spent two years on him,
and that nobody ever came close.

2479
02:30:02,084 --> 02:30:04,084
All the evidence said no.

2480
02:30:05,336 --> 02:30:07,672
Sherwood disqualified his handwriting.

2481
02:30:07,672 --> 02:30:10,840
The same Sherwood
that drinks like Paul Avery now?

2482
02:30:11,714 --> 02:30:13,756
Yes, you have Sherwood Morrill
in writing saying,

2483
02:30:13,756 --> 02:30:14,882
"I'm sorry, this just won't work."

2484
02:30:14,882 --> 02:30:16,756
-But you also have Terry Pascoe...
-His protégé.

2485
02:30:16,756 --> 02:30:17,882
Yeah, fine, it's his protégé,

2486
02:30:17,882 --> 02:30:19,840
but he's a handwriting expert
nonetheless, and he's saying,

2487
02:30:19,840 --> 02:30:22,630
"Do not disqualify this suspect
on the basis of handwriting."

2488
02:30:22,630 --> 02:30:24,672
-So the two cancel each other out.
-No, they don't.

2489
02:30:24,672 --> 02:30:26,042
It was Sherwood's case.

2490
02:30:26,084 --> 02:30:27,630
He was the head
of Questioned Documents.

2491
02:30:27,630 --> 02:30:29,084
If it went to trial,

2492
02:30:29,084 --> 02:30:32,126
all the defense would have to do
is call Sherwood to the stand.

2493
02:30:32,126 --> 02:30:34,882
And there was no way of getting Allen
into court in the first place,

2494
02:30:34,882 --> 02:30:36,210
because there was no evidence, Robert.

2495
02:30:36,210 --> 02:30:37,462
What do you mean,
there's no evidence?

2496
02:30:37,462 --> 02:30:38,672
You have him seen with the ciphers.

2497
02:30:38,672 --> 02:30:41,000
The military boot prints.
The same size shoes and gloves.

2498
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,294
<i>The Most Dangerous Game.</i>
The Zodiac watch.

2499
02:30:43,336 --> 02:30:44,630
The background with school children.

2500
02:30:44,630 --> 02:30:46,546
The misspellings of Christ-mass.
The bloody knives.

2501
02:30:46,546 --> 02:30:48,504
All circumstantial.

2502
02:30:48,504 --> 02:30:51,378
Paul Stine's shirt, his wallet, his keys.

2503
02:30:51,378 --> 02:30:53,210
We should have found
one of those things in that trailer.

2504
02:30:53,210 --> 02:30:54,966
-We didn't.
-That's...

2505
02:30:57,378 --> 02:30:59,462
Okay. Catherine Allen states that

2506
02:30:59,462 --> 02:31:01,714
"Leigh cleaned out his trailer
on Friday after work

2507
02:31:01,714 --> 02:31:05,462
"and moved it to Santa Rosa
on Saturday, August 7th, 1971."

2508
02:31:05,462 --> 02:31:07,588
You interviewed him
at the refinery on August 4th.

2509
02:31:07,588 --> 02:31:09,210
-Yeah.
-So, he's cleaning out his trailer,

2510
02:31:09,210 --> 02:31:13,084
he's moving into a different county
48 hours after you interviewed him?

2511
02:31:14,630 --> 02:31:17,756
Okay. Okay.
Look at the stuff side by side, Dave.

2512
02:31:17,756 --> 02:31:18,966
All right.

2513
02:31:18,966 --> 02:31:21,840
Okay, Arthur Leigh Allen
and the Zodiac, their timelines.

2514
02:31:21,840 --> 02:31:24,630
-When was the first murder in Vallejo?
-Christmas, 1968.

2515
02:31:24,630 --> 02:31:27,336
Eight months before that,
Allen is fired for molesting his students

2516
02:31:27,336 --> 02:31:29,546
and his family discovers
that he's a pedophile.

2517
02:31:29,546 --> 02:31:31,924
-Now, when do the letters begin?
-July, '69.

2518
02:31:31,924 --> 02:31:33,714
After the murder of Darlene Ferrin.

2519
02:31:33,714 --> 02:31:36,882
And they continue
until you go to see him at work.

2520
02:31:36,882 --> 02:31:40,210
Now, after that, do any of the letters
contain swatches of Paul Stine's shirt?

2521
02:31:40,210 --> 02:31:42,126
No. Because he dumped them,
because he got scared.

2522
02:31:42,126 --> 02:31:43,966
Because he knew
that you were on to him.

2523
02:31:43,966 --> 02:31:47,798
-So, when's the next letter from Zodiac?
-Not until January of 1974.

2524
02:31:47,798 --> 02:31:49,294
He is silent for three years.

2525
02:31:49,294 --> 02:31:51,168
Then, in '74, he feels comfortable again

2526
02:31:51,168 --> 02:31:53,168
because everybody's moved off
Allen as a suspect.

2527
02:31:53,168 --> 02:31:54,252
And what do we get?

2528
02:31:54,252 --> 02:31:58,378
Three new letters from Zodiac
in January, May, and July in '74.

2529
02:31:58,378 --> 02:32:01,504
-But then the letters stop.
-What happens to Allen?

2530
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:06,504
He's arrested.

2531
02:32:07,420 --> 02:32:10,840
January, 1975,
they send him to Atascadero.

2532
02:32:10,840 --> 02:32:13,840
We don't get another letter from Zodiac
the entire time he's there.

2533
02:32:13,840 --> 02:32:16,588
-When is he released?
-August, '77.

2534
02:32:16,588 --> 02:32:20,420
Allen gets out. He types you an apology,
and then what?

2535
02:32:20,420 --> 02:32:23,630
We get our first new Zodiac letter
in four years.

2536
02:32:29,210 --> 02:32:32,714
Okay. Zodiac had to have known
Darlene Ferrin, right?

2537
02:32:32,714 --> 02:32:35,042
Yes, because of the phone calls
on the night of her murder.

2538
02:32:35,042 --> 02:32:37,924
Because of the Vallejo file,

2539
02:32:37,924 --> 02:32:40,042
we know that Darlene knew
a man named Leigh?

2540
02:32:40,042 --> 02:32:41,126
Yes.

2541
02:32:41,126 --> 02:32:43,000
So, all coincidence aside, Robert,

2542
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,924
how can you be sure that Leigh Allen
is the Leigh from this file?

2543
02:32:45,924 --> 02:32:48,462
Now, Vallejo is a small town,
but it's not that small.

2544
02:32:48,462 --> 02:32:49,882
How do you put
the two of them together?

2545
02:32:49,882 --> 02:32:53,126
This is a case that's covered
both Northern and Southern California,

2546
02:32:53,126 --> 02:32:55,630
with victims and suspects
spread over hundreds of miles.

2547
02:32:55,630 --> 02:32:57,378
-Would you agree?
-Yes.

2548
02:32:58,630 --> 02:33:01,504
Darlene Ferrin worked
at the Vallejo House of Pancakes

2549
02:33:01,504 --> 02:33:04,042
on the corner of Tennessee and Caroll.

2550
02:33:06,882 --> 02:33:11,630
Arthur Leigh Allen lived in his
mother's basement on Fresno Street.

2551
02:33:13,336 --> 02:33:16,756
Door to door, that is less than 50 yards.

2552
02:33:20,126 --> 02:33:21,630
Is that true?

2553
02:33:22,630 --> 02:33:24,168
I've walked it.

2554
02:33:27,966 --> 02:33:29,462
Jesus Christ.

2555
02:33:36,126 --> 02:33:37,126
So?

2556
02:33:41,042 --> 02:33:42,714
The prints, the handwriting...

2557
02:33:42,714 --> 02:33:45,714
-I'm not asking you as a cop.
-But I am a cop.

2558
02:33:48,588 --> 02:33:50,714
I can't prove this.

2559
02:33:50,714 --> 02:33:53,756
Just because you can't prove it,
doesn't mean it's not true.

2560
02:33:53,756 --> 02:33:55,420
Easy, Dirty Harry.

2561
02:33:58,966 --> 02:34:00,546
Finish the book.

2562
02:34:09,462 --> 02:34:11,966
Thank you. Thank you for breakfast.

2563
02:35:20,210 --> 02:35:21,714
Can I help you?

2564
02:35:23,378 --> 02:35:24,378
No.

2565
02:36:45,756 --> 02:36:47,126
Mr. Mageau.

2566
02:36:47,798 --> 02:36:50,168
Thanks for coming to see me.

2567
02:36:50,168 --> 02:36:51,630
You're the one I talked to on the phone?

2568
02:36:51,630 --> 02:36:55,168
I'm George Bawart. Vallejo PD.
I took over for Jack Mulanax.

2569
02:36:56,168 --> 02:36:59,252
It's been 22 years.
I don't know how I can help you.

2570
02:36:59,252 --> 02:37:00,546
Well, this is just a formality.

2571
02:37:00,546 --> 02:37:02,042
I'm gonna show you
a group of photographs.

2572
02:37:02,042 --> 02:37:04,000
Now, the person that shot you
may or may not be

2573
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,126
among these photographs.

2574
02:37:06,126 --> 02:37:07,420
You don't have to pick anybody out

2575
02:37:07,420 --> 02:37:09,714
just because I'm showing you
these pictures, you understand?

2576
02:37:09,714 --> 02:37:11,252
Yes, sir, I do.

2577
02:37:12,126 --> 02:37:13,504
All right.

2578
02:37:14,504 --> 02:37:16,042
Take your time.

2579
02:37:16,504 --> 02:37:19,336
If you don't recognize anyone,
that's okay.

2580
02:37:30,798 --> 02:37:32,168
That's him.

2581
02:37:33,630 --> 02:37:35,672
How sure are you?

2582
02:37:35,672 --> 02:37:37,546
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

2583
02:37:40,210 --> 02:37:41,420
He had a round face like this guy.

2584
02:37:41,420 --> 02:37:42,756
Wait. Am I to understand

2585
02:37:42,756 --> 02:37:44,588
that you're now identifying
the second photograph?

2586
02:37:44,588 --> 02:37:47,714
No, no. Just that
he had a round face like that.

2587
02:37:49,756 --> 02:37:51,252
It's this man.

2588
02:37:52,126 --> 02:37:53,462
All right.

2589
02:37:55,294 --> 02:37:58,378
Now, on a scale of one to 10,
10 being positive,

2590
02:38:02,462 --> 02:38:04,084
how sure are you?

2591
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:09,504
At least an eight.

2592
02:38:12,252 --> 02:38:16,126
The last time I saw this face
was July 4th, 1969.

2593
02:38:19,378 --> 02:38:22,084
I am very sure
that's the man who shot me.
