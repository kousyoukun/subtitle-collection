00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:56,178
- You know, Will...
- I ain't the same.

320
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:02,427
Claudia straightened me up.
Cleared me of drinking whiskey and all.

321
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:05,562
Going on this killing...

322
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,899
...don't mean I'll go back
to the way I was.

323
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:11,940
Just need the money.

324
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:16,816
- Get a new start for them youngsters.
- Yeah. Yeah.

325
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:23,371
Remember that drover
I shot in the mouth...

326
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,704
...and his teeth came
out the back of his head?

327
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:32,213
- Yeah.
- I think about him now and again.

328
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:37,795
He didn't do anything
to deserve to get shot.

329
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:41,841
At least nothing I remembered
when I sobered up.

330

NED:
You was one crazy son of a bitch.

331
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:54,862
No one liked me,
and the boys all thought...

332
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,606
...I'd shoot them
out of pure meanness.

333
00:30:57,773 --> 00:31:02,074
NED:
You ain't like that no more.

334
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,159
Eagle, he hated my guts.

335
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,542
Bonaparte didn't think too much of me.

336
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,745
NED:
Quincy neither, I reckon.

337
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:17,168
Quincy used to just watch
all the time...

338
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,087
...scared.

339
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,756

Like I said...

...you ain't like that no more.

341
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,520
That's right.

342
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:32,020
I'm just a fellow now.

343
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:35,109
I ain't no different
than anyone else...

344
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,104
...no more.

345
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:57,500
What son of a bitch shot him?
Was it one of them John Bulls?

346
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:02,255
ENGLISH BOB: No, the would-be assassin
is a gentleman of French ancestry.

347
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:06,304
Or so it seems.
I don't wish to give offense...

348
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:10,475
...but the French are known
to be a race of assassins...

349
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,722
...who can't shoot worth a damn.

350
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:16,648
Any Frenchmen present
are excluded, of course.

351
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:21,649
Says here a fellow by the name
of Guiteau. G-U-I-T...

352
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:25,573
Sure as hell sounds
like a John Bull to me.

353
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:31,618
Again, I don't wish to give offense
when I suggest this country select...

354
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:36,168
...a king or even a queen,
rather than a president.

355
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:41,127
One isn't that quick
to shoot a king or a queen.

356
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,842
The majesty of royalty, you see.

357
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,847
Maybe you don't wish
to give offense, sir...

358
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:52,263
...but you are giving it pretty thick.

359
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,432
This country don't need
no queens whatsoever.

360
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,439
- When I heard about queens...
THIRSTY: Shut up, Joe.

00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,438
What's wrong with you, Thirsty?
This dude...

362
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:04,567
Might be that this dude
is English Bob.

363
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,616
Works for the railroad
shooting Chinamen.

364
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:12,708
Might be he's waiting
for some cowboy to touch his pistol...

365
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,576
...so he can shoot him.

366
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,973
Is that a fact, mister?

367
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,884

Let's shoot some pheasants.

370
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:40,478
Ten shots.

371
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,484
At, let's say, $1 a pheasant.

372
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:47,321
I'll shoot for the queen, and you...

373
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,327
...for whomever.

375

That's eight for me and one for you.
That comes to seven American dollars.

376
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:13,681
Pretty damn good shooting...

377
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,595
...for a John Bull.

378
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:20,442
No doubt your aim was
affected by your grief...

379
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:24,772
...over the injury to your president.

Come on, yeah!

ENGLISH BOB: It's the climate that
does it. And the infernal distances.

W.W.:
Does what?

383
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,883
Induces people to shoot
persons in high places.

384
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,672
- Yeah, uh...
ENGLISH BOB: It's a savage country.

385
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:53,138
ENGLISH BOB: That's the second one
shot in 20 years.

386
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:56,720
It's uncivilized shooting
persons of substance.

Come on.

Whoa. Whoa.

Thank you.

ANDY:
Pardon me, gentlemen.

391
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:07,045
The law obliges you to surrender
sidearms to the proper authorities.

392
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,338
Proper authority?

393
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:17,889
I assure you that neither my companion
or I carry firearms on our person.

394
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:22,268
We rely upon the goodwill
of our fellow man...

395
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,892
...and the forbearance of reptiles.

Christ, it's hot!

398
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:47,464
If I'm going to get shot,
I'd rather it was hot than cold.

399
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:51,836
Everything hurts more when it's cold.
You know how if you hit...

Shut up, Fatty!

- No.

Shit!

00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:09,106
- You clean my Remington?
- Cleaned and loaded.

405

Where's Little Bill?

406
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,274
Building his damn porch.

would you want it to be hot or cold?

ANDY:
I ain't gonna get shot.

He's coming?

411
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,167
CLYDE:
Of course he's coming.

412
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,377
I just loaded that.

413
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:34,844
I don't trust nobody loading my guns
before a shooting.

414
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,258
What'd he say?

415
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:39,678
Little Bill said
he was building his porch.

416
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:43,266
- You seen that thing?
- It was all loaded.

417
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:47,436
Clyde, you got three pistols
and you only got one arm!

418
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,570
I don't want to get killed
for lack of shooting back.

419
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:56,445
He don't have a straight
angle on that whole porch!

420
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:01,406
Or the whole house, for that matter!
He is the worst damn carpenter.

421
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,740
He didn't say nothing?

422
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:07,460
Asked what they looked like.

423
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:10,914
Maybe he's tough, but he
sure ain't no carpenter.

424
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,212
Maybe he ain't so tough.

425
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,136
Seem like he was scared?

426
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,052
Little Bill? Him scared?

427
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:24,561

He worked them tough towns.

00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,737
Just wondered.

432
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,608
Anybody could be scared.

433
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,619
He wasn't scared, boys.

434
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,836
He just ain't no carpenter.

435
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,880
There's a dignity in royalty...

436
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,925
...which precludes
the likelihood of assassination.

437
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,056

- If you pointed a pistol...

438
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:05,598
...at a monarch,
your hands would shake as if palsied.

439
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:09,394
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody.

440
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:11,479
That's a wise policy.

441
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:15,896
But if you did, I assure you,
the sight of royalty...

442
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:19,445
...would cause you to dismiss thoughts
of bloodshed.

443
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:20,859
BARBER: Right.
- You would stand...

444
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:24,454
How shall I put it?
In awe.

445

Why not shoot a president?

00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,514
- Billiards?
- Uh-huh.

I don't really wish to play?

No matter. They burned the

637
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:48,870
I can assure you, Mr. Daggett...

638
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:53,007
...that the events described are
from eyewitness accounts.

639
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:54,880
- Eyewitnesses?
- Yes, sir.

640
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:57,799
Like the Duck himself, I guess.

641
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:01,302
The Duke.

642
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,012
Duck, I says.

643
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,650
"'You have insulted the honor of
this beautiful woman, Corcoran...'

644
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:17,148
...said the Duck.

645
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:20,405
'You must apologize.'

646
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,237
But Two-Gun Corcoran
would have none of it.

647
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:26,912
He reached for his
pistols and would have killed him...

648
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:32,334
...but the Duck was faster and hot lead
blazed from his smoking six-guns."

649
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:36,091
I consider that an accurate
depiction of events.

650
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:40,713
There is a certain poetry to the
language which I couldn't resist.

651
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,927
LITTLE BILL:
Mr. Beauchamp.

652
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:47,098
I was in the Blue Bottle
Saloon in Wichita...

653
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:50,931
...the night English Bob
killed Corky Corcoran.

654
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,857
I didn't see you there.

655
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:55,186
Nor no woman.

656
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,563
Nor two-gun shooters.

657
00:55:57,855 --> 00:56:00,574
- Nor none of this.
- You were there?

658
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,242
LITTLE BILL:
Yeah, I was there.

659
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:06,288
First off...

660
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:10,702
...Corky never carried two guns,
though he should have.

661
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,957
W.W.:
He was called Two-Gun Corcoran.

662
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:17,754
A lot of folks did call him Two-Gun,
but not because he had two pistols.

663
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:19,960
It was because his dick...

664
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:23,677
...was longer than the barrel
on his Walker Colt.

665
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:30,939
Only insulting he did was stick it
into a French lady Bob was sweet on.

666
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:36,732
When Corky walked into the Blue Bottle
and before he knew what's what...

667
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:40,481
...Bob takes a shot at him!
And misses, he's so damn drunk.

668
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:44,907
That bullet whizzing by panicked
Corky. He did the wrong thing.

669
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:47,989
He hurried
and shot his damn toe off.

670
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:50,832
Meantime, Bob here...

671
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:54,416
...aims real good
and squeezes off another...

672
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:59,633
...but he misses, he's still so drunk!
Hits a $1000 mirror over the bar.

673
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:05,639
The Duck of Death is as good as dead
because Corky does it right.

674
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:08,016
He aims real careful.

675
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,265
- No hurry.
- And?

676
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:12,016
Bam!

677
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:18,152
That Walker Colt blew up in his hand,
a failing common to that model.

678
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:24,029
If Corky'd had two guns instead of
a big dick, he would've been there...

679
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,948
...to defend himself to the end.

680
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,654
Wait a minute.

681
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:33,542
English Bob killed him when
he didn't even have...

682
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:37,713
Bob wasn't going to wait
for Corky to grow a new hand.

683
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:41,717
No, he just
walked over there real slow...

684
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,545
...because he was drunk...

685
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:47,844
...and shot him
through the liver.

686
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:11,405
NED: Don't like rocks
on my dadgum back!

687

- I sure do miss my bed.
- You said that last night.

688
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:20,085
Last night I said I missed my wife.
Tonight I just miss my dadgum bed!

- The way they say it happened?
- What business?

695
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:57,327
There's two deputies up close
pointing their rifles right at you.

696
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:59,328
Got you dead to rights.

697
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:03,123
You pulled out your pistol
and blew them to hell.

698
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:06,551
Only took a scratch yourself.

699
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:14,385
Uncle Pete never seen
nothing like it...

700

...shooting your way out
of that scrape.

What the hell's that to you?

00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:56,431
To know the kind of fellow I'm riding
with, in case we get into a scrape.

709
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:02,308
- How many men you killed, Kid?
- Five.

710
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:04,359
How many?

711
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,154
Five!

712
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,532
I done killed five of them.

713
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:15,909
That's including a Mexican.
He come after me with a knife.

Why don't you shut up?
Get some rest.

You boys are as crotchety
as a couple of old hens.

716
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:30,836
Actually, then, Mr. Corcoran was faster
on the draw than the Duck...

717
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:32,880
Than English Bob?

718
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:35,724
Faster?
Faster was his mistake.

719
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:39,554
If he hadn't rushed, he wouldn't have
shot himself in the toe.

720
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:41,893
He would've killed old Bob.

721
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:44,433
Look, son.

722
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:48,320
Being a good shot,
being quick with a pistol...

723
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:53,409
...don't do no harm, but it don't mean
much next to being cool-headed.

724
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:57,743
A man who'll keep his head,
not get rattled under fire...

725
01:00:57,946 --> 01:00:59,744
...like as not he'll kill you.

- But if the other fellow is quicker...
- Then he'll hurry and he'll miss.

Look here.

728
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:14,092
That's as fast as I can draw, aim, hit
anything more than 10 feet away.

Unless it's a barn.

First, Ned wouldn't talk.

Then Little Bill hurt him so

He said how you was really
William Munny out of Missouri.
