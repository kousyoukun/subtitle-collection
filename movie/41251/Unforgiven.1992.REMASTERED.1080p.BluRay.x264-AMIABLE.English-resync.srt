00:29:53,434 --> 00:29:55,778
- You know, Will...
- I ain't the same.

320
00:29:57,271 --> 00:30:02,027
Claudia straightened me up.
Cleared me of drinking whiskey and all.

321
00:30:03,444 --> 00:30:05,162
Going on this killing...

322
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:08,499
...don't mean I'll go back
to the way I was.

323
00:30:09,867 --> 00:30:11,540
Just need the money.

324
00:30:12,036 --> 00:30:16,416
- Get a new start for them youngsters.
- Yeah. Yeah.

325
00:30:20,127 --> 00:30:22,971
Remember that drover
I shot in the mouth...

326
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:26,304
...and his teeth came
out the back of his head?

327
00:30:28,218 --> 00:30:31,813
- Yeah.
- I think about him now and again.

328
00:30:33,891 --> 00:30:37,395
He didn't do anything
to deserve to get shot.

329
00:30:37,561 --> 00:30:41,441
At least nothing I remembered
when I sobered up.

330
00:30:45,653 --> 00:30:48,247
NED:
You was one crazy son of a bitch.

331
00:30:51,492 --> 00:30:54,462
No one liked me,
and the boys all thought...

332
00:30:54,703 --> 00:30:57,206
...I'd shoot them
out of pure meanness.

333
00:30:57,373 --> 00:31:01,674
NED:
You ain't like that no more.

334
00:31:02,586 --> 00:31:04,759
Eagle, he hated my guts.

335
00:31:06,423 --> 00:31:09,142
Bonaparte didn't think too much of me.

336
00:31:09,593 --> 00:31:11,345
NED:
Quincy neither, I reckon.

337
00:31:12,012 --> 00:31:16,768
Quincy used to just watch
all the time...

338
00:31:18,185 --> 00:31:19,687
...scared.

339
00:31:20,854 --> 00:31:22,356
NED:
Like I said...

340

...you ain't like that no more.

341
00:31:26,777 --> 00:31:28,120
That's right.

342
00:31:29,697 --> 00:31:31,620
I'm just a fellow now.

343
00:31:31,865 --> 00:31:34,709
I ain't no different
than anyone else...

344
00:31:35,452 --> 00:31:36,704
...no more.

345
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:57,100
What son of a bitch shot him?
Was it one of them John Bulls?

346
00:31:57,349 --> 00:32:01,855
ENGLISH BOB: No, the would-be assassin
is a gentleman of French ancestry.

347
00:32:02,104 --> 00:32:05,904
Or so it seems.
I don't wish to give offense...

348
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:10,075
...but the French are known
to be a race of assassins...

349
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,322
...who can't shoot worth a damn.

350
00:32:12,573 --> 00:32:16,248
Any Frenchmen present
are excluded, of course.

351
00:32:16,493 --> 00:32:21,249
Says here a fellow by the name
of Guiteau. G-U-I-T...

352
00:32:21,498 --> 00:32:25,173
Sure as hell sounds
like a John Bull to me.

353
00:32:25,586 --> 00:32:31,218
Again, I don't wish to give offense
when I suggest this country select...

354
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:35,768
...a king or even a queen,
rather than a president.

355
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:40,727
One isn't that quick
to shoot a king or a queen.

356
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:43,442
The majesty of royalty, you see.

357
00:32:46,523 --> 00:32:49,447
Maybe you don't wish
to give offense, sir...

358
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:51,863
...but you are giving it pretty thick.

359
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:55,032
This country don't need
no queens whatsoever.

360
00:32:55,365 --> 00:32:58,039
- When I heard about queens...
THIRSTY: Shut up, Joe.

361
00:32:58,285 --> 00:33:01,038
What's wrong with you, Thirsty?
This dude...

362
00:33:01,288 --> 00:33:04,167
Might be that this dude
is English Bob.

363
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:08,216
Works for the railroad
shooting Chinamen.

364
00:33:08,462 --> 00:33:12,308
Might be he's waiting
for some cowboy to touch his pistol...

365
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:14,176
...so he can shoot him.

366
00:33:25,979 --> 00:33:28,573
Is that a fact, mister?

367
00:33:28,732 --> 00:33:30,484

Let's shoot some pheasants.

370
00:33:38,826 --> 00:33:40,078
Ten shots.

371
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:43,084
At, let's say, $1 a pheasant.

372
00:33:43,747 --> 00:33:46,921
I'll shoot for the queen, and you...

373
00:33:47,334 --> 00:33:48,927
...for whomever.

[GUNSHOT]

375

That's eight for me and one for you.
That comes to seven American dollars.

376
00:34:10,858 --> 00:34:13,281
Pretty damn good shooting...

377
00:34:13,443 --> 00:34:15,195
...for a John Bull.

378
00:34:15,696 --> 00:34:20,042
No doubt your aim was
affected by your grief...

379
00:34:20,868 --> 00:34:24,372
...over the injury to your president.

DRIVER:
Come on, yeah!

381

ENGLISH BOB: It's the climate that
does it. And the infernal distances.

W.W.:
Does what?

383
00:34:41,388 --> 00:34:44,483
Induces people to shoot
persons in high places.

384
00:34:45,517 --> 00:34:49,272
- Yeah, uh...
ENGLISH BOB: It's a savage country.

385
00:34:49,438 --> 00:34:52,738
ENGLISH BOB: That's the second one
shot in 20 years.

386
00:34:52,941 --> 00:34:56,320
It's uncivilized shooting
persons of substance.

Come on.

Whoa. Whoa.

Thank you.

ANDY:
Pardon me, gentlemen.

391
00:36:01,218 --> 00:36:06,645
The law obliges you to surrender
sidearms to the proper authorities.

392
00:36:07,641 --> 00:36:08,938
Proper authority?

393
00:36:12,062 --> 00:36:17,489
I assure you that neither my companion
or I carry firearms on our person.

394
00:36:18,068 --> 00:36:21,868
We rely upon the goodwill
of our fellow man...

395
00:36:22,114 --> 00:36:24,492
...and the forbearance of reptiles.

396

Christ, it's hot!

398
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:47,064
If I'm going to get shot,
I'd rather it was hot than cold.

399
00:36:47,306 --> 00:36:51,436
Everything hurts more when it's cold.
You know how if you hit...

Shut up, Fatty!

- No.

403
00:36:59,401 --> 00:37:00,493
Shit!

00:37:05,907 --> 00:37:08,706
- You clean my Remington?
- Cleaned and loaded.

405
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,747
Where's Little Bill?

406
00:37:12,247 --> 00:37:13,874
Building his damn porch.

would you want it to be hot or cold?

ANDY:
I ain't gonna get shot.

410

He's coming?

411
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:27,767
CLYDE:
Of course he's coming.

412
00:37:28,555 --> 00:37:29,977
I just loaded that.

413
00:37:30,223 --> 00:37:34,444
I don't trust nobody loading my guns
before a shooting.

414
00:37:34,811 --> 00:37:35,858
What'd he say?

415
00:37:36,229 --> 00:37:39,278
Little Bill said
he was building his porch.

416
00:37:40,067 --> 00:37:42,866
- You seen that thing?
- It was all loaded.

417
00:37:43,111 --> 00:37:47,036
Clyde, you got three pistols
and you only got one arm!

418
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:51,170
I don't want to get killed
for lack of shooting back.

419
00:37:52,996 --> 00:37:56,045
He don't have a straight
angle on that whole porch!

420
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:01,006
Or the whole house, for that matter!
He is the worst damn carpenter.

421
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:03,340
He didn't say nothing?

422
00:38:04,216 --> 00:38:07,060
Asked what they looked like.

423
00:38:07,761 --> 00:38:10,514
Maybe he's tough, but he
sure ain't no carpenter.

424
00:38:11,014 --> 00:38:12,812
Maybe he ain't so tough.

425
00:38:14,017 --> 00:38:16,736
Seem like he was scared?

426
00:38:17,604 --> 00:38:19,652
Little Bill? Him scared?

427
00:38:20,941 --> 00:38:24,161
We never seen him up
against any like these ones.

He worked them tough towns.

431
00:38:32,994 --> 00:38:34,337
Just wondered.

432
00:38:36,331 --> 00:38:38,208
Anybody could be scared.

433
00:38:43,296 --> 00:38:45,219
He wasn't scared, boys.

434
00:38:46,466 --> 00:38:49,436
He just ain't no carpenter.

435
00:38:54,182 --> 00:38:56,480
There's a dignity in royalty...

436
00:38:56,726 --> 00:38:59,525
...which precludes
the likelihood of assassination.

437
00:38:59,688 --> 00:39:01,656
BARBER: Uh-huh.
- If you pointed a pistol...

438
00:39:01,898 --> 00:39:05,198
...at a monarch,
your hands would shake as if palsied.

439
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:08,994
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody.

440
00:39:09,156 --> 00:39:11,079
That's a wise policy.

441
00:39:11,992 --> 00:39:15,496
But if you did, I assure you,
the sight of royalty...

442
00:39:15,745 --> 00:39:19,045
...would cause you to dismiss thoughts
of bloodshed.

443
00:39:19,207 --> 00:39:20,459
BARBER: Right.
- You would stand...

444
00:39:20,709 --> 00:39:24,054
How shall I put it?
In awe.

445
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:31,763

Why not shoot a president?

00:39:37,517 --> 00:39:38,939

00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:51,114
- Billiards?
- Uh-huh.

I don't really wish to play?

No matter. They burned the

You've shaved your chin whiskers off.

637
00:54:46,092 --> 00:54:48,470
I can assure you, Mr. Daggett...

638
00:54:48,886 --> 00:54:52,607
...that the events described are
from eyewitness accounts.

639
00:54:52,807 --> 00:54:54,480
- Eyewitnesses?
- Yes, sir.

640
00:54:55,476 --> 00:54:57,399
Like the Duck himself, I guess.

641
00:54:58,979 --> 00:55:00,902
The Duke.

642
00:55:01,315 --> 00:55:02,612
Duck, I says.

643
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:15,250
"'You have insulted the honor of
this beautiful woman, Corcoran...'

644
00:55:15,496 --> 00:55:16,748
...said the Duck.

645
00:55:18,082 --> 00:55:20,005
'You must apologize.'

646
00:55:20,334 --> 00:55:22,837
But Two-Gun Corcoran
would have none of it.

647
00:55:23,087 --> 00:55:26,512
He reached for his
pistols and would have killed him...

648
00:55:26,757 --> 00:55:31,934
...but the Duck was faster and hot lead
blazed from his smoking six-guns."

649
00:55:32,847 --> 00:55:35,691
I consider that an accurate
depiction of events.

650
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:40,313
There is a certain poetry to the
language which I couldn't resist.

651
00:55:40,479 --> 00:55:42,527
LITTLE BILL:
Mr. Beauchamp.

652
00:55:43,524 --> 00:55:46,698
I was in the Blue Bottle
Saloon in Wichita...

653
00:55:47,027 --> 00:55:50,531
...the night English Bob
killed Corky Corcoran.

654
00:55:50,739 --> 00:55:52,457
I didn't see you there.

655
00:55:53,284 --> 00:55:54,786
Nor no woman.

656
00:55:55,035 --> 00:55:57,163
Nor two-gun shooters.

657
00:55:57,455 --> 00:56:00,174
- Nor none of this.
- You were there?

658
00:56:00,374 --> 00:56:01,842
LITTLE BILL:
Yeah, I was there.

659
00:56:04,545 --> 00:56:05,888
First off...

660
00:56:06,547 --> 00:56:10,302
...Corky never carried two guns,
though he should have.

661
00:56:10,634 --> 00:56:12,557
W.W.:
He was called Two-Gun Corcoran.

662
00:56:12,803 --> 00:56:17,354
A lot of folks did call him Two-Gun,
but not because he had two pistols.

663
00:56:17,558 --> 00:56:19,560
It was because his dick...

664
00:56:19,852 --> 00:56:23,277
...was longer than the barrel
on his Walker Colt.

665
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:30,539
Only insulting he did was stick it
into a French lady Bob was sweet on.

666
00:56:30,905 --> 00:56:36,332
When Corky walked into the Blue Bottle
and before he knew what's what...

667
00:56:36,577 --> 00:56:40,081
...Bob takes a shot at him!
And misses, he's so damn drunk.

668
00:56:40,331 --> 00:56:44,507
That bullet whizzing by panicked
Corky. He did the wrong thing.

669
00:56:45,336 --> 00:56:47,589
He hurried
and shot his damn toe off.

670
00:56:48,589 --> 00:56:50,432
Meantime, Bob here...

671
00:56:51,342 --> 00:56:54,016
...aims real good
and squeezes off another...

672
00:56:54,261 --> 00:56:59,233
...but he misses, he's still so drunk!
Hits a $1000 mirror over the bar.

673
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:05,239
The Duck of Death is as good as dead
because Corky does it right.

674
00:57:05,898 --> 00:57:07,616
He aims real careful.

675
00:57:08,067 --> 00:57:09,865
- No hurry.
- And?

676
00:57:10,069 --> 00:57:11,616
Bam!

677
00:57:12,279 --> 00:57:17,752
That Walker Colt blew up in his hand,
a failing common to that model.

678
00:57:18,452 --> 00:57:23,629
If Corky'd had two guns instead of
a big dick, he would've been there...

679
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:26,548
...to defend himself to the end.

680
00:57:26,877 --> 00:57:28,254
Wait a minute.

681
00:57:29,296 --> 00:57:33,142
English Bob killed him when
he didn't even have...

682
00:57:33,467 --> 00:57:37,313
Bob wasn't going to wait
for Corky to grow a new hand.

683
00:57:37,471 --> 00:57:41,317
No, he just
walked over there real slow...

684
00:57:41,767 --> 00:57:44,145
...because he was drunk...

685
00:57:45,396 --> 00:57:47,444
...and shot him
through the liver.

686
00:58:07,876 --> 00:58:11,005
NED: Don't like rocks
on my dadgum back!

687

- I sure do miss my bed.
- You said that last night.

688
00:58:15,384 --> 00:58:19,685
Last night I said I missed my wife.
Tonight I just miss my dadgum bed!

- The way they say it happened?
- What business?

695
00:58:53,047 --> 00:58:56,927
There's two deputies up close
pointing their rifles right at you.

696
00:58:57,176 --> 00:58:58,928
Got you dead to rights.

697
00:58:59,219 --> 00:59:02,723
You pulled out your pistol
and blew them to hell.

698
00:59:02,931 --> 00:59:06,151
Only took a scratch yourself.

699
00:59:09,855 --> 00:59:13,985
Uncle Pete never seen
nothing like it...

700

...shooting your way out
of that scrape.

What the hell's that to you?

00:59:49,978 --> 00:59:56,031
To know the kind of fellow I'm riding
with, in case we get into a scrape.

709
00:59:58,278 --> 01:00:01,908
- How many men you killed, Kid?
- Five.

710
01:00:02,116 --> 01:00:03,959
How many?

711
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:07,754
Five!

712
01:00:08,038 --> 01:00:10,132
I done killed five of them.

713
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:15,509
That's including a Mexican.
He come after me with a knife.

Why don't you shut up?
Get some rest.

You boys are as crotchety
as a couple of old hens.

716
01:00:25,305 --> 01:00:30,436
Actually, then, Mr. Corcoran was faster
on the draw than the Duck...

717
01:00:31,228 --> 01:00:32,480
Than English Bob?

718
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:35,324
Faster?
Faster was his mistake.

719
01:00:35,524 --> 01:00:39,154
If he hadn't rushed, he wouldn't have
shot himself in the toe.

720
01:00:39,445 --> 01:00:41,493
He would've killed old Bob.

01:00:42,156 --> 01:00:44,033
Look, son.

722
01:00:44,825 --> 01:00:47,920
Being a good shot,
being quick with a pistol...

723
01:00:48,162 --> 01:00:53,009
...don't do no harm, but it don't mean
much next to being cool-headed.

724
01:00:53,167 --> 01:00:57,343
A man who'll keep his head,
not get rattled under fire...

725
01:00:57,546 --> 01:00:59,344
...like as not he'll kill you.

- But if the other fellow is quicker...
- Then he'll hurry and he'll miss.

Look here.

728
01:01:08,515 --> 01:01:13,692
That's as fast as I can draw, aim, hit
anything more than 10 feet away.

Unless it's a barn.

Not on purpose.

But he started hurting him worse.

First, Ned wouldn't talk.

Then Little Bill hurt him so
bad, he said who you was.

1307

He said how you was really
William Munny out of Missouri.

1308
01:51:39,418 --> 01:51:42,422
Little Bill said, "The one

Said you was...
