2
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,311
It's small!

3
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,202
No, please. No!
Please!

4
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,787
Davey!

5
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,289
Come running, lad!

6
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,253
- Stop!
- Brand you like a damn steer, bitch!

7
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,590
- No. Please!
- Hold the bitch! Go on, hold her!

8
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,177
Hold her, damn it!
I'll cut her tits off!

9
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,513
Go get Skinny! Quick!

10
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,224
Mike, don't!

11
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:28,814
Skinny!

12
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,275
Think it's funny?

13
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,028
Skinny, get the gun!

14
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,833
Get off of her, cowboy.

15
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,134
- Wouldn't let you settle it?
- You know Skinny.

16
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:00,762
He says he'll shoot them.
I says, "You can't."

17
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,433
He says, "Get Little Bill."
I says, "He's sleeping."

18
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,353
He says he don't care.
He'll shoot them boys soon.

19
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,327
She gonna die?

20
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,370
She's gonna live.

21
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,375
She didn't steal nothing
or touch his poke.

22
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,295
When she seen
his teensy little pecker ...

23
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:37,674
... she giggled.
She didn't know no better.

24
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,179
You can hang them, Little Bill.

25
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:06,536
Step over to the office
and get the bullwhip.

26
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:10,207
A whipping's all they get
after what they done?

27
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:16,255
- It ain't no little thing, Alice.
- But what they done --

28
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,006
Shut up!

29
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,595
- Whipping ain't gonna settle this.
- No?

30
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:28,892
Here's a contract between me
and Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut whore.

31
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:33,563
I brought her from Boston,
paid her expenses and all.

32
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,484
I got a contract that represents
an investment of capital.

33
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,027
Property.

34
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,071
Damaged property.

35
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,908
Like if I hamstrung
one of their ponies.

36
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,621
You think nobody'll fuck her now?

37
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,915
Hell, no!

38
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,959
Won't pay to do it.

39
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:59,673
She can clean, but nobody's gonna pay
good money for a cut-up whore!

40
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:06,388
You boys are off the Bar T.
Got your own string of ponies?

41
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,141
Yeah, I got four.

42
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,353
Six.

43
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,607
You just as soon
not have a trial, no fuss?

44
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,609
No, sir.

45
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,653
All right.

46
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,947
You did the cutting.

47
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:27,784
Come the fall, you bring in
five ponies to Skinny here.

48
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,703
Five?

49
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,789
And you!
You bring in two.

50
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,125
- You give them over, hear?
- Yes, sir.

51
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,670
Here's the bullwhip, Bill.

52
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,174
Maybe we don't need this now.

53
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:48,305
Let me tell you, come the spring,
Skinny don't have those ponies ... .

54
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:53,852
- I'll come looking for you.
- You ain't whipping them?

55
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,938
I fined them instead, Alice.

56
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,900
Skinny gets some ponies and that's it?!

57
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,153
That ain't fair.

58
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,738
That ain't fair!

59
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,456
Haven't you seen
enough blood tonight?

60
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,878
Hell, Alice!

61
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:26,426
It ain't like they was tramps or
loafers or bad men. They were just ...

62
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,846
... hardworking boys that was foolish.

63
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:34,017
- If they was given over to wickedness --
- Like whores?

64
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,729
Tend to Delilah.

65
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,983
Go ahead.

66
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,799
I got $85.

67
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,509
I don't know.

68
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,263
If Delilah doesn't care,
why are we so riled up?

69
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:15,183
Just because we let them fools
ride us like horses ...

70
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,895
... don't mean we let them
brand us like horses.

71
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:24,151
Maybe we ain't nothing but whores,
but, by God, we ain't horses!

72
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,113
I got $112.

73
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,532
That's everything.

74
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,493
How about you, Faith?

75
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,747
Two hundred.

76
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,042
Two hundred and forty dollars.

77
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,588
Jesus, Faith!
What you been doing?

78
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,508
Been giving Skinny something special?

79
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,055
She laughed.

80
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:01,146
With what Kate got, and Silky,
me and Little Sue --

81
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,606
It ain't enough.

82
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,318
Not yet, maybe.

83
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,486
You don't look like no
rootin'-tootin' ...

84
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,906
... son of a bitching
cold-blooded assassin.

85
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,245
Say what?

86
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:03,124
My guess is you're calling yourself
Mr. William Munny.

87
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,628
You have me confused
with someone else, mister.

88
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,799
The same one who shot Charlie Pepper
in Lake County?

89
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,551
Pa! Hey, Pa!

90
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,219
What's up, son?

91
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,429
Two more hogs got the fever.

92
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,515
You shot Charlie Pepper.

93
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:22,102
You killed William Harvey
and robbed that train in Missouri.

94
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,603
Hold on, mister.

95
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,524
Son, get those hogs separated there.

96
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,651
Penny, help your brother.

97
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:33,405
- That one's sick too?
- Yeah.

98
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,535
We'll talk inside.

99
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,920
So you're Pete Sothow's nephew?

100
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:55,552
I thought you'd come to kill me for
something I'd done in the old days.

101
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,222
I could have. Easy.

102
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,727
I guess maybe so.

103
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:10,191
You don't look like no meaner-than-hell,
cold-blooded damn killer.

104
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,736
Maybe I ain't.

105
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:17,365
Uncle Pete says you was the meanest
goddamn son of a bitch alive.

106
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:22,412
And if I wanted a partner
for a killing, you were the worst one.

107
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,751
Meaning the best.

108
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,712
On account as you're as cold as snow ...

109
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,840
... and don't have
no weak nerve nor fear.

110
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,136
Pete said that?

111
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,473
Yeah, he did.

112
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,017
I'm a killer myself, except ...

113
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:47,479
... I ain't killed as many as you
because of my youth.

114
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,358
Schofield Kid,
that's what they call me.

115
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,778
Why?

116
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,280
You from Schofield?

117
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,282
No, it's on account ...

118
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,994
... of my Schofield model
Smith & Wesson pistol.

119
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,334
How about it, Will?

120
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,920
How about what?

121
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,631
How about being my partner?

122
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:20,679
I'm heading north through Niobrara
to Wyoming to kill two no-good cowboys.

123
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,640
For what?

124
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,894
For cutting up a lady.
Cut up her face.

125
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,939
Cut her eyes out,
cut her ears off.

126
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,192
They even cut her teats.

127
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,655
Jesus.

128
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,825
$1,000 reward, Will.

129
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,577
500 apiece.

130
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,959
I can't move those damn pigs!

131
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:55,588
Watch your cussing, will you?
Do the best you can with it.

132
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,509
Then go to the pump
and get cleaned up. Come on.

133
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,809
I ain't like that anymore, Kid.

134
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,731
It was whiskey done it
as much as anything else.

135
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,191
I ain't had a drop in over 10 years.

136
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,362
My wife, she cured me of that.

137
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,825
Cured me of drinking and wickedness.

138
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,704
You don't look so prosperous.

139
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,876
You could buy her a new dress
with your half.

140
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:37,756
- If we kill them, you can buy your --
- She's passed on.

141
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,340
What?

142
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,220
Been gone near 3 years now.

143
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:55,315
Don't tell no one about the reward.
I don't need other gunmen collecting.

144
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,067
We don't see no one out here.

145
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:03,656
If you was to change your mind,
I'll be riding due west ...

146
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,159
... for the trail into Wyoming.

147
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,876
Come on, let's separate those hogs.

148
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:48,159
Two others.
I think they got the fever.

149
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,261
Took you boys a while.

150
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:52,849
A few more days and I was
gonna call on the sheriff.

151
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,350
How about that?

152
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,729
The river was all swelled up.
Couldn't cross it.

153
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,773
I bet. Sleepy,
get them horses to the livery.

154
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,651
Neil, take that one
over around the back.

155
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,661
Now there's a beauty.

156
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,998
You got two of mine.
This here one ain't yours.

157
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,000
We'll see about that.

158
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:23,087
Bastards!
Get out of town!

159
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,468
Sick sons of bitches!

160
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,391
- Don't come back, butcher!
- This here pony ...

161
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,978
... I brung for the lady my partner cut.

162
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,408
She's the best.

163
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:00,750
Better than the ones I gave him.

164
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,922
She can sell her ...

165
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,216
... or do what she wants.

166
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:16,683
A pony? She ain't got no face left,
you give her a mangy pony?

167
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,018
She ain't mangy!

168
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,688
Get out of here!

169
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:25,274
We don't need your goddamn charity!

170
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,444
Get out of our town
and don't come back!

171
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,448
Get out of our town!

172
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:48,149
Did Pa used to kill folks?

173
00:18:56,677 --> 00:19:00,054
I could tell your ma liked
those flowers I gave her.

174
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:05,143
He ain't a saddle horse no more.
Ain't used to the feel.

175
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,270
Take care of your sister, son.

176
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:12,275
Kill a few chickens if you must.
Keep those hogs with the fever separate.

177
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:17,238
If you have any problem, go see
Sally Two Trees at Ned Logan's.

178
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,683
Ain't been in the saddle myself
in a while.

179
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:53,065
She's getting even with me
for the sins of my youth.

180
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:57,486
In my youth before I met
your dear departed ma ...

181
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:02,200
... I used to be weak
and given to mistreating animals.

182
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:11,125
This horse and those hogs
over there ...

183
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:17,131
... are getting even
for the cruelty I inflicted.

184
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,133
I used to be able to cuss ...

185
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:23,888
... and whip a horse, but your ma
showed me the error of my ways.

186
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,017
I'll be back in two weeks.

187
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:33,314
Remember the spirit of your dear
departed ma watches over you.

188
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,209
- Where'd you get the money?
- We ain't got any!

189
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,796
- You told them cowboys you had!
- We was lying!

190
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,923
Lying?

191
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:02,760
What'll you do if somebody
comes to collect?

192
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,639
You going to hump them
a thousand times?

193
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:14,647
The kind of people who come for it
won't tolerate you not having it!

194
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:20,361
They won't just cut up your face!

195
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,908
You stupid bitches.

196
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,577
You stupid bitches!

197
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,133
Shit!

198
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,844
Damn it! Jesus!

199
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,055
Hit your finger?

200
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,101
Hello, Skinny.

201
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,562
Damn, you snuck up on me.

202
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,398
What do you think of her?

203
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,192
I heard you done the roof yourself.

204
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:05,031
Roof? Jesus, I did practically
the whole damn thing myself.

205
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:09,160
The Roberts boy carried wood for me,
but that's all.

206
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,287
What is all that wood?

207
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,333
I'm building a porch
so I can sit of an evening ...

208
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:20,129
... and smoke my pipe and drink coffee
and watch the sunset.

209
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,718
Came out here just
to take a look at her?

210
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,970
- Them whores!
- Yeah?

211
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:33,684
Been humping them cowboys
who been in town the last two weeks.

212
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,603
Shit, Skinny.

213
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:40,232
We got railroad barons.
We got cattle barons.

214
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,319
You'll be the first billiard baron.

215
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:47,490
They been humping and telling
every bowlegged one of them ...

216
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,743
... they'll pay $1,000 to whoever ...

217
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:53,996
... kills the two boys
that cut up Delilah.

218
00:22:56,208 --> 00:23:00,461
Those cowboys are riding that beef
down to Kansas and Cheyenne?

219
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,887
All week long?

220
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,640
I didn't hear till last night myself.

221
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:16,936
The word's probably got all the way
to Texas by now.

222
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,482
Nobody'll come clear from Texas.

223
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,443
You sure they got that money?

224
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:30,199
Women can lie. Asked where the
money is, they say they got none.

225
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:34,745
But those five could have
squirreled it away. Maybe.

226
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,417
That much?

227
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:43,671
You could run off them two cowboys.

228
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,841
I could run off them whores.

229
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,679
They'll just up and run anyhow,
them two.

230
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,935
They'll stay out at the Bar T.

231
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,813
Close to their friends.

232
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,025
Shit, could be nobody
won't come at all.

233
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,780
Got to go.
I like your house.

234
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,400
Well, I'll be ...

235
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,236
It's Will!

236
00:24:55,869 --> 00:25:01,499
Come in the house out of the sun.
Sally, see to Will's horse.

237
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,839
What are you doing here?

238
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:12,259
Just thought I'd drop in on you.

239
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,513
We ain't bad men no more.

240
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,515
We're farmers.

241
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:22,728
Should be easy killing them,
if they don't go on down to Texas.

242
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:28,442
How long since you fired a gun
at a man? Nine, ten years?

243
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,196
Eleven.

244
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,949
Easy, huh?

245
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:39,036
I don't know it was
all that easy even back then.

246
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,164
And we was young and full of beans.

247
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,458
If you was mad at them ...

248
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:47,836
... over some wrong,
I could see shooting them.

249
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,215
We done stuff for money before.

250
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,887
We thought we did.

251
00:25:57,138 --> 00:26:00,182
What'd these fellows do?
Cheat at cards?

252
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:03,978
Steal some strays?
Spit on a rich fellow? What?

253
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,771
They cut up a woman.

254
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,439
What?

255
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:14,029
Cut up her face, cut her eyes out,
cut her fingers off, cut her tits.

256
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,075
Everything but her cunny,
I suppose.

257
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,495
I'll be dogged.

258
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,835
Guess they got it coming.

259
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,921
Of course, Will ...

260
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:36,218
... if Claudia was alive,
you wouldn't do this.

261
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,397
Could you look in on my youngsters
next week?

262
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:51,525
They got some hogs
they're trying to separate.

263
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,614
How long you reckon you're gonna be?

264
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,617
Two weeks, I guess.

265
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,213
What's this Kid like?

266
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:17,676
Three ways?

267
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,473
I see you still have
that Spencer rifle.

268
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,812
And I can still knock the eye
out of a bird flying too.

269
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,781
Jesus, Will!

270
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,298
He must be moving right along.

271
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:42,302
We'll come across him
tomorrow, I reckon.

272
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,815
Kind of got used to my bed.

273
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:58,485
This ain't going to be like no home.

274
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:01,405
That ain't the only thing I'll miss.

275
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,287
Hell, I'm sorry.

276
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:12,416
Don't fret it.
It ain't nothing.

277
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,547
She don't like it much,
you riding off with me.

278
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,383
Gave me the evil eye.

279
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,598
You know, Sally's injun ...

280
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,642
... and injuns ain't over-friendly.

281
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,271
I don't blame her.

282
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,608
I won't hold it against her.

283
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,777
She knew me back then.

284
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,779
She knew what a ...

285
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,782
... no-good son of a bitch I was.

286
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,203
She ain't allowing that I changed.

287
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,790
She don't realize I ain't
like that no more.

288
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,375
- You know, Will --
- I ain't the same.

289
00:29:56,878 --> 00:30:01,632
Claudia straightened me up.
Cleared me of drinking whiskey and all.

290
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,760
Going on this killing ...

291
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:08,096
... don't mean I'll go back
to the way I was.

292
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,141
Just need the money.

293
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:15,062
Get a new start for them youngsters.

294
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:22,569
Remember that drover
I shot in the mouth ...

295
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:25,906
... and his teeth came
out the back of his head?

296
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:31,411
I think about him now and again.

297
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:37,000
He didn't do anything
to deserve to get shot.

298
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:41,046
At least nothing I remembered
when I sobered up.

299
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,845
You was one crazy son of a bitch.

300
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:54,059
No one liked me,
and the boys all thought ...

301
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:58,063
... I'd shoot them
out of pure meanness.

302
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,275
You ain't like that no more.

303
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,361
Eagle, he hated my guts.

304
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,740
Bonaparte didn't think too much of me.

305
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,951
Quincy neither, I reckon.

306
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,373
Quincy used to just watch
all the time ...

307
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,293
... scared.

308
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,962
Like I said ...

309
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:26,216
... you ain't like that no more.

310
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,718
That's right.

311
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,221
I'm just a fellow now.

312
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:34,308
I ain't no different
than anyone else ...

313
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,310
... no more.

314
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:56,705
What son of a bitch shot him?
Was it one of them John Bulls?

315
00:31:56,956 --> 00:32:01,460
No, sir. The would-be assassin
is a gentleman of French ancestry.

316
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:05,505
Or so it seems.
I don't wish to give offense ...

317
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:09,676
... but the French are known
to be a race of assassins ...

318
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,929
... who can't shoot worth a damn.

319
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,849
Any Frenchmen present
are excluded, of course.

320
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:20,854
Says here a fellow by the name
of Guiteau. G-U-I-T --

321
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,775
Sure as hell sounds
like a John Bull to me.

322
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:30,822
Again, I don't wish to give offense
when I suggest this country select ...

323
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:35,369
... a king or even a queen,
rather than a president.

324
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,332
One isn't that quick
to shoot a king or a queen.

325
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,043
The majesty of royalty, you see.

326
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,049
Maybe you don't wish
to give offense, sir ...

327
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,468
... but you are giving it pretty thick.

328
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,638
This country don't need
no queens whatsoever.

329
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,641
- When I heard about queens --
- Shut up, Joe.

330
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:00,644
What's wrong with you, Thirsty?
This dude --

331
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,772
Might be that this dude
is English Bob.

332
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,818
Works for the railroad
shooting Chinamen.

333
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:11,905
Might be he's waiting for some cowboy
to touch his pistol ...

334
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,782
... so he can shoot him.

335
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:28,171
Is that a fact, mister?

336
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,090
You English Bob?

337
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,386
Pheasants.

338
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,181
Let's shoot some pheasants.

339
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,683
Ten shots.

340
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,686
At, let's say, $1 a pheasant.

341
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,523
I'll shoot for the queen, and you ...

342
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,525
... for whomever.

343
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:10,297
That's eight for me and one for you.
That comes to seven American dollars.

344
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,883
Pretty damn good shooting ...

345
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,801
... for a John Bull.

346
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:19,639
No doubt your aim was
affected by your grief ...

347
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:23,977
... over the injury to your president.

348
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:39,367
It's the climate that does it.
That, and the infernal distances.

349
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:40,619
Does what?

350
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:44,081
Induces people to shoot
persons in high places.

351
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,339
That's the second one shot
in 20 years.

352
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:55,926
It's uncivilized shooting
persons of substance.

353
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,317
Thank you.

354
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,488
Pardon me, gentlemen.

355
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:06,246
The law obliges you to surrender
sidearms to the proper authorities.

356
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,540
Proper authority?

357
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:17,090
I assure you that neither my companion
or I carry firearms on our person.

358
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:21,469
We rely upon the goodwill
of our fellow man ...

359
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:24,097
... and the forbearance of reptiles.

360
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,362
Unarmed, my ass!

361
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:41,823
Christ, it's hot!

362
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:46,661
If I'm going to get shot,
I'd rather it was hot than cold.

363
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:51,041
Everything hurts more when it's cold.
You know how if you hit --

364
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,500
Shut up, Fatty!

365
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,129
Clyde's back.

366
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,256
- With Little Bill?
- No.

367
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,091
Shit!

368
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:08,308
- You clean my Remington?
- Cleaned and loaded.

369
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,353
Where's Little Bill?

370
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,480
Building his damn porch.

371
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,565
Building his porch?

372
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:19,486
If you got shot,
would you want it to be hot or cold?

373
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,488
I ain't gonna get shot.

374
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,574
He's coming?

375
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,369
Of course he's coming.

376
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,579
I just loaded that.

377
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:34,042
I don't trust nobody loading my guns
before a shooting.

378
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,418
What'd he say?

379
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,880
Little Bill said he was building
his porch.

380
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,467
- You seen that thing?
- It was all loaded.

381
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:46,137
Clyde, you got three pistols
and you only got one arm!

382
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:50,767
I don't want to get killed
for lack of shooting back.

383
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,647
He don't have a straight
angle on that whole porch!

384
00:37:56,107 --> 00:38:00,610
Or the whole house, for that matter!
He is the worst damn carpenter.

385
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,946
He didn't say nothing?

386
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,658
Asked what they looked like.

387
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:10,120
Maybe he's tough,
but he ain't no carpenter.

388
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,414
Maybe he ain't so tough.

389
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,334
Seem like he was scared?

390
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:19,254
Little Bill? Him scared?

391
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,758
We never seen him up
against any like these ones.

392
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,052
Killers.

393
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:30,056
Little Bill come out of Kansas
and Texas, boys.

394
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,267
He worked them tough towns.

395
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:33,935
Just wondered.

396
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,814
Anybody could be scared.

397
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,821
He wasn't scared, boys.

398
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:49,034
He just ain't no carpenter.

399
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:56,082
There's a dignity in royalty ...

400
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,461
... which precludes
the likelihood of assassination.

401
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,254
If you pointed a pistol ...

402
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,799
... at a monarch,
your hands would shake as if palsied.

403
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:08,595
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody.

404
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,680
That's a wise policy.

405
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,101
But if you did, I assure you,
the sight of royalty ...

406
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:20,065
... would cause you to dismiss thoughts
of bloodshed. You would stand --

407
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:23,651
How shall I put it?
In awe.

408
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:31,368
A president ...
Why not shoot a president?

409
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,541
Keep the change.

410
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:42,545
This Strawberry Alice person,
tell me again.

411
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:46,549
Down the street to Greely's Beer
Garden and Billiards Parlor.

412
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:49,344
Say you want a game of billiards.

413
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:52,889
Billiards? Even though
I don't really wish to play?

414
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:56,976
No matter. They burned the table
in '78 for firewood.

415
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,229
Quite right.

416
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,191
Mr. Beauchamp,
I think a cup of tea --

417
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,541
Hello, Bob.

418
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,712
Boys, this here is English Bob.

419
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:28,133
Shit and fried eggs.

420
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,220
Been a long time.

421
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,973
Run out of Chinamen?

422
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,602
I thought that you were dead.

423
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:43,189
You've shaved your chin whiskers off.

424
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,777
I was tasting the soup
two hours after I ate it.

425
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:51,448
Actually, what I heard was,
you fell off your horse ...

426
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,116
... drunk, of course.

427
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,994
And that you broke your bloody neck.

428
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,664
I heard that one myself, Bob.

429
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,749
Hell, I even thought I was dead.

430
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:05,295
Till I found out
I was just in Nebraska.

431
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,338
Who's he?

432
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,340
W.W. Beauchamp.

433
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:13,928
This is Little Bill Daggett.

434
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:16,139
And friends, of course.

435
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:19,684
From Newton, Hays? From Abilene?

436
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,187
In person.

437
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,857
You work for the railroads too?

438
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,027
I write.

439
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,154
Letters?

440
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,364
Books, Bill. Books.

441
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,533
Actually ...

442
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,578
... he's my biographer.

443
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,711
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

444
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,054
It's only a book.

445
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:57,680
A book?

446
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,523
That means you boys can read.

447
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:12,529
That means you saw the signs outside
town saying surrender your firearms.

448
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:17,951
But like you told young Andy ...

449
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,496
... you're not armed, are you?

450
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,248
Not really, Bill.

451
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:28,253
Got a Peacemaker, but that
wouldn't worry you, would it?

452
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:32,757
If you don't see it.
Or better, if you don't hear it.

453
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,051
I'm afraid so, Bob.

454
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:38,888
I don't like firearms around.

455
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,495
Be very careful with it, sonny.

456
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:11,379
See what kind of books
Mr. Beauchamp is packing.

457
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,386
Make sure you don't get wet.

458
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:25,727
No shit.

459
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:29,397
All he's got is writing
stuff and this book.

460
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,735
The Duck of Death?

461
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,278
Duke.

462
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,448
"The Duke."

463
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,620
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

464
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,997
I'll have that .32, Bob.

465
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,803
Now, Little Bill ...

466
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:04,807
... you will leave me at the mercy
of my enemies.

467
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,105
Enemies?

468
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:17,862
You been talking about the queen again?

469
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,280
On Independence Day?

470
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:35,421
I guess you think I'm kicking you.

471
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,298
But it ain't so!

472
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,592
What I'm doing is talking!

473
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,721
You hear?!
Talking to all them villains in Kansas!

474
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:46,474
To all those villains in Missouri!

475
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,483
And those villains ...

476
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:58,778
... down in Cheyenne!

477
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:08,579
I'm saying there ain't no whore's gold!

478
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:16,921
Even if there was,
they wouldn't want to come for it ...

479
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,172
... anyhow!

480
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,413
What are you all looking at?!
Go on!

481
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,714
Mind your own business!

482
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,119
Ever go into town?

483
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:35,249
On occasion.
To sell a hog, pick up supplies.

484
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:39,045
I mean, get yourself a woman.

485
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:44,801
No, I never go into town for that.

486
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,761
A man like me?

487
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:51,390
Only woman I could get
is one I'd have to pay for.

488
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,310
That ain't right, buying flesh.

489
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:59,398
Claudia, rest her soul,
wouldn't want me doing that ...

490
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,108
... me being a father.

491
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:08,991
You just use your hand?

492
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:16,332
I don't miss it all that much.

493
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:39,355
Goddamn!
Somebody's shooting at us!

494
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,149
Shit. Did it hit you?

495
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:47,947
I bumped my head
falling off my horse.

496
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,161
Ain't shooting at us no more.

497
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,332
Shooting way over yonder.

498
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:03,087
What the hell's he shooting at?

499
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:06,007
Beats the hell out of me.

500
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,344
Reckon we in somebody's field?

501
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:13,389
I didn't see nothing planted.

502
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,016
Shooting at us again.

503
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,981
He's shooting at the whole horizon.

504
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,859
Wait! You'll mark us!

505
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,360
Hey, Kid!

506
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:32,366
- That's the Kid shooting at us?
- Kid, it's me! Will Munny!

507
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,952
What's he shooting at us for?

508
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:36,454
Is that you?

509
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:40,541
Yeah, it's me!

510
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:44,211
Don't go shooting at us no more!
You hear me?

511
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:47,965
Who the hell you got with you, Will?

512
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,635
It's Ned Logan, my old partner!

513
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:53,471
Don't go shooting at us, you hear?

514
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:57,058
We'll get our horses
and come on over there.

515
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:00,895
You ain't going to shoot, are you?

516
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:03,064
No, I ain't!

517
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:19,956
- Chased that horse a damn mile.
- What was you shooting at us for?

518
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,959
- I thought you was following me.
- We was.

519
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:27,713
- You said if I changed my mind --
- Wasn't nothing said about no partner.

520
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,257
This here's Ned Logan.

521
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:33,636
He's the Schofield Kid,
nephew to Pete Sothow.

522
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:39,141
I seen two fellows following me.
My guess is, you come to kill me.

523
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:41,852
We never talked about no other fellow.

524
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:46,482
There's two cowboys. Better there's
three of us, if they got friends.

525
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:50,569
I can take care of them two myself.
It don't take three.

526
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:56,075
Ned's an awful good shot with a rifle.
Hit a bird in the eye flying.

527
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,119
Better than you, anyhow.

528
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,912
You wasn't even close.

529
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,665
Get your damn hands off my rifle!

530
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:15,845
Thought I'd check it for you.
Maybe something's bent.

531
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,555
It ain't bent.

532
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,393
- You were shooting all over!
- You'll share your half with him?

533
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,770
I figured three ways.

534
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,314
You figured wrong.

535
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,485
Sorry I wasted your time, Ned.

536
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,614
You going back with him?

537
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:38,534
He's my partner.

538
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,619
He don't go, I don't go.

539
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,585
What's it come to, three ways?

540
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:42,807
Shit!

541
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:46,519
What are you pissing on about?

542
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:52,191
- What are you looking at, anyhow?
- Looking at?

543
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,818
Clouds, Kid.

544
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:58,072
Looking at them on account of we got
a storm riding up our ass.

545
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,743
Hell, I seen them.

546
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:16,674
You was smart to change your mind.

547
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:22,346
I'm a real good shot with this rifle.

548
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:25,349
See that hawk?

549
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:31,772
I could hit it with one shot.

550
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:39,446
Hell, I could hit it too.
If I didn't mind wasting a shot.

551
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,784
There ain't no hawk, Kid.

552
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:46,954
You can't see for shit, can you?

553
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,875
See your canteen?

554
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:58,799
How far can you see?

555
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:02,678
- Far enough.
- We ain't shooting canteens! How far?

556
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:05,181
- 100 yards?
- More.

557
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:08,267
- See that scrub oak tree yonder?
- Fuck you.

558
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:11,395
- He's blind!
- I ain't blind, you asshole!

559
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:13,230
Hold it!

560
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:16,609
How far can you see, Kid?
50 yards?

561
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,945
You bet your ass
I can see 50 yards, Will.

562
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:23,741
I can see well enough
to shoot this son of a bitch.

563
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,284
Hold on.

564
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:27,244
Hear that, Ned?

565
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,955
Kid can see 50 yards. Fine.

566
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,125
Jesus!

567
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:39,840
50 yards'll do just fine.
Now let's move out.

568
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:51,227
They look like real hard cases, Bob.

569
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:56,523
Did you kill all seven of them?
Or just wing some of them?

570
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:05,616
That you here, Bob, on the cover?

571
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:09,703
"The Duck of Death"?

572
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:13,999
It's the Duke.
"Duke of Death."

573
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:22,049
You always were the hell in Jesus
with a pistol, but seven of them?

574
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:26,553
Protecting that woman.
How do you do that?

575
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:33,394
It's desirable in the publishing
business to take a certain ...

576
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:36,522
... liberty when depicting
the cover scene.

577
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,565
For reasons involving the marketplace --

578
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:43,821
From what I read, the writing's not
that much different than the picture.

579
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,075
I can assure you, Mr. Daggett ...

580
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:52,204
... that the events described
are from eyewitness accounts.

581
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,081
Eyewitnesses?

582
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:58,335
Like the Duck himself, I guess.

583
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,504
The Duke.

584
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:02,214
Duck, I says.

585
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:14,852
"'You have insulted the honor
of this beautiful woman, Corcoran ...'

586
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,353
... said the Duck.

587
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,606
'You must apologize.'

588
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:22,443
But Two-Gun Corcoran
would have none of it.

589
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:26,113
He reached for his pistols
and would have killed him ...

590
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:31,535
... but the Duck was faster and hot lead
blazed from his smoking six-guns."

591
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:35,289
I consider that an accurate
depiction of events.

592
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:39,918
There is a certain poetry to
the language which I couldn't resist.

593
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:46,300
I was in the Blue Bottle Saloon
in Wichita ...

594
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:50,137
... the night English Bob
killed Corky Corcoran.

595
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,056
I didn't see you there.

596
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,391
Nor no woman.

597
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:56,769
Nor two-gun shooters.

598
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:59,772
- Nor none of this.
- You were there?

599
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:01,440
Yeah, I was there.

600
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,486
First off ...

601
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:09,907
... Corky never carried two guns,
though he should have.

602
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:12,159
He was called Two-Gun Corcoran.

603
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:16,955
A lot of folks did call him Two-Gun,
but not because he had two pistols.

604
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,166
It was because his dick ...

605
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:22,878
... was longer than the barrel
on his Walker Colt.

606
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:30,135
Only insulting he did was stick it
into a French lady Bob was sweet on.

607
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:35,933
When Corky walked into the Blue Bottle
and before he knew what's what ...

608
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:39,686
... Bob takes a shot at him!
And misses, he's so damn drunk.

609
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:44,108
That bullet whizzing by panicked
Corky. He did the wrong thing.

610
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:47,194
He hurried
and shot his damn toe off.

611
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:50,030
Meantime, Bob here ...

612
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:53,617
... aims real good
and squeezes off another ...

613
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:58,831
... but he misses, he's still so drunk!
Hits a $1,000 mirror over the bar.

614
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:04,837
The Duck of Death is as good as dead
because Corky does it right.

615
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:07,214
He aims real careful.

616
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,466
- No hurry.
- And?

617
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:17,349
That Walker Colt blew up in his hand,
a failing common to that model.

618
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:23,230
If Corky'd had two guns instead of
a big dick, he would've been there ...

619
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:26,150
... to defend himself to the end.

620
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:27,860
Wait a minute.

621
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:32,739
English Bob killed him when
he didn't even have ...

622
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:36,910
Bob wasn't going to wait
for Corky to grow a new hand.

623
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:40,914
No, he just walked over there
real slow ...

624
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:43,750
... because he was drunk ...

625
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:47,045
... and shot him
through the liver.

626
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:10,611
Don't like rocks
on my dadgum back!

627
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:14,781
- I sure do miss my bed.
- You said that last night.

628
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:20,454
Last night I said I missed my wife.
Tonight I just miss my dadgum bed!

629
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:23,916
You'll miss your dadgum roof next,
I suppose.

630
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,002
Shit!

631
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:46,104
That business up in Jackson County,
that really happen?

632
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:50,025
- The way they say it happened?
- What business?

633
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:56,532
There's two deputies up close
pointing their rifles right at you.

634
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,534
Got you dead to rights.

635
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:02,329
You pulled out your pistol
and blew them to hell.

636
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:05,749
Only took a scratch yourself.

637
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,590
Uncle Pete never seen
nothing like it ...

638
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:16,426
... shooting your way out
of that scrape.

639
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:22,683
I don't recollect.

640
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,854
You don't recollect?

641
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,649
That's right.

642
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:33,569
Ned ...

643
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:38,865
... how many men you killed?

644
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,329
Ain't you gonna answer?

645
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:47,874
What the hell's that to you?

646
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:55,632
To know the kind of fellow I'm riding
with, in case we get into a scrape.

647
00:59:57,885 --> 01:00:01,513
- How many men you killed, Kid?
- Five.

648
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:03,557
How many?

649
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:07,352
Five!

650
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:09,730
I done killed five of them.

651
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:15,110
That's including a Mexican.
He come after me with a knife.

652
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:17,571
Why don't you shut up?
Get some rest.

653
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:22,576
You boys are as crotchety
as a couple of old hens.

654
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:30,042
Actually, then, Mr. Corcoran was faster
on the draw than the Duck --

655
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:32,085
Than English Bob?

656
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,921
Faster?
Faster was his mistake.

657
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:38,759
If he hadn't rushed, he wouldn't have
shot himself in the toe.

658
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:41,094
He would've killed old Bob.

659
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:47,517
Being a good shot,
being quick with a pistol ...

660
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:52,606
... don't do no harm, but it don't mean
much next to being cool-headed.

661
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:56,943
A man who'll keep his head,
not get rattled under fire ...

662
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:59,237
... like as not he'll kill you.

663
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:03,867
- But if the other fellow is quicker --
- Then he'll hurry and he'll miss.

664
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:05,285
Look here.

665
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:13,293
That's as fast as I can draw, aim, hit
anything more than 10 feet away.

666
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:15,379
Unless it's a barn.

667
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:17,756
But if he doesn't miss?

668
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:20,801
He'll kill you.

669
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:28,892
That's why there's so few
dangerous men around like Bob.

670
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:31,311
Like me.

671
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:35,565
It ain't so easy to shoot a man
if he's shooting back.

672
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,776
That'll flat rattle some folks.

673
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:41,780
Let me show you something.

674
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:44,741
Look here.
Take that.

675
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:49,496
Go on, take it.

676
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,419
There's the key.

677
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:58,505
Just shoot me ...

678
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:03,343
... and you and Bob can ride on
out of here free as birds.

679
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:12,227
- Is it loaded?
- Wouldn't do any good if it wasn't.

680
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:14,312
First, you got to cock it.

681
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:22,779
Go on, cock it.

682
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:33,039
Now you got to point it.

683
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:37,753
Go on. Point it.

684
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:50,849
Now all you got to do
is pull the trigger.

685
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:06,656
Hot, ain't it?

686
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:11,578
Didn't even put your finger
on the trigger.

687
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,413
What if ...?

688
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:17,292
What if I gave it to him?

689
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,044
Give it to him.

690
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:31,264
- You don't really want me to --
- Give it to him.

691
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:33,994
I guess he don't want it.

692
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:58,018
You were right not to take it.

693
01:04:58,269 --> 01:04:59,686
I'd have killed you.

694
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:20,874
We could use some rain.

695
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:34,220
You no-good, goddamn
pig-fucking whore!

696
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,641
Sorry, old horse.

697
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:51,821
I brung this for when we kill
them fellows.

698
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:54,240
Figured we could use some now.

699
01:05:54,533 --> 01:05:56,743
Not me. I don't touch it no more.

700
01:05:57,036 --> 01:06:00,205
- Come on, it's raining.
- I know it's raining!

701
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:02,457
Give some to the Kid.

702
01:06:05,252 --> 01:06:09,005
You think that Kid
really killed five men?

703
01:06:09,423 --> 01:06:10,757
No.

704
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:19,933
When he talked about the time
them deputies had the drop on you ...

705
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:26,398
I remember there was three men
you shot, not two.

706
01:06:26,607 --> 01:06:29,067
I ain't like that no more, Ned!

707
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,778
I ain't no crazy killing fool.

708
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:37,784
Still think it'll be easy
to kill them cowboys?

709
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:40,787
If we don't drown first.

710
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,215
Give these keys to the conductor.

711
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:57,095
He can loose Bob's cuffs
as soon as he's outside the county.

712
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:59,806
Got my pistols?

713
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:04,102
I guess you know, Bob ...

714
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:09,482
... that if I see you again
I'll just shoot in self-defense.

715
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:17,907
I didn't steal your biographer!

716
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:21,161
He's staying on his own account!

717
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:24,539
He can go stuff himself
as well, can't he?!

718
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:27,792
The plague on the whole
stinking lot of you!

719
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:30,170
Without morals or laws!

720
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:34,591
And all you whores!
You got no laws and no honor!

721
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:38,595
It's no wonder you all
emigrated to America!

722
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:41,681
Because they wouldn't have you
in England!

723
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,642
You're a lot of savages!

724
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:48,688
You're all a bunch of bloody savages!
A curse on you!

725
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:53,193
Nobody's going to come ...

726
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:57,822
... after what Little Bill done
to that Englishman.

727
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:01,367
Delilah, can't you get
them tables clean?

728
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:06,539
Cover your face, somebody might hump
you and you wouldn't have to clean.

729
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:11,211
- What do they call that face cover?
- A veil.

730
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,338
Yeah. Get a veil!

731
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:24,557
Rain's coming.

732
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:26,810
Thank God.

733
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,545
You sure?

734
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:07,225
You all right, Will?

735
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,195
Fellow asking for you.

736
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:22,157
Tonight?
You ain't joshing?

737
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:24,409
This way, mister.

738
01:09:24,785 --> 01:09:27,745
Must be randy as hell
to come out in this shit.

739
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:40,925
"No, no! You're wrong, Little Bill!"
he said.

740
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:44,470
"That's not a Curly J.
That's a Bobbed J!"

741
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:47,599
He had changed it over.
And I said to him:

742
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:50,935
"Jim, you're a liar and a horse thief!"

743
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:57,317
When he saw nobody would help him,
he started crying ...

744
01:09:57,568 --> 01:10:00,153
... and sobbing
and just carrying on.

745
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:04,115
He said, "God, please,
don't kill me, Bill!"

746
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:06,826
So I said, "Jim, it makes me sick ..."

747
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:09,787
Open the window, will you?

748
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:14,292
"... to see a man carrying
two pistols and a Henry rifle ...

749
01:10:14,793 --> 01:10:17,003
... and crying like a damn baby."

750
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:19,505
- So you killed him?
- No.

751
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:21,507
But I should have.

752
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:24,469
I can't abide them kind.

753
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:26,804
You see them in the taverns.

754
01:10:27,097 --> 01:10:29,349
Tramps and drunk teamsters.

755
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:31,684
Crazed miners.

756
01:10:32,436 --> 01:10:35,855
Sporting their pistols and acting
like they was bad men.

757
01:10:36,273 --> 01:10:40,235
But without any sand or character.
Not even any bad character.

758
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:46,866
I do not like assassins.

759
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:50,161
Or men of low character.

760
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:53,206
Like your friend, English Bob.

761
01:10:53,874 --> 01:10:55,875
But, now Bob was no coward.

762
01:10:56,126 --> 01:10:59,337
He wouldn't cry
and carry on like that --

763
01:11:00,714 --> 01:11:01,756
Sheriff ... .

764
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:05,718
I don't have any more receptacles.

765
01:11:06,136 --> 01:11:09,555
Maybe you should hang the carpenter.

766
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:11,557
What?

767
01:11:13,894 --> 01:11:18,314
I was just saying because of the ...
You hang ...

768
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:20,400
Doesn't matter.

769
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:24,654
What the hell?

770
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:27,073
On a night like this!

771
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:32,412
- Who the hell is it?
- Deputy Charley Hecker, Bill.

772
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:40,503
Three fellows just come into town.
They're down to Greely's.

773
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:43,089
At least two of them got guns.

774
01:11:50,764 --> 01:11:53,349
What the hell's keeping that Kid?

775
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:56,936
You don't suppose he's up --

776
01:11:58,272 --> 01:11:59,897
Jesus, Will!

777
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:01,607
You look like shit.

778
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,948
You remember Eagle Hendershot?

779
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:15,204
I saw him.

780
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:18,124
Will, he's dead.

781
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:20,877
No, I saw him, Ned.

782
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:25,381
His head was broke open.
You could see inside of it.

783
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:29,886
Jesus! You got a fever.

784
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:33,473
- Take a drink, will you?
- Worms were coming out.

785
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,645
Look, I'm going up to see
what's keeping the Kid.

786
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:44,442
Must be getting an advance
from one of the sporting ladies.

787
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:48,154
If I was to ...

788
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:55,661
If it worked out that I could take
a little time for myself ...

789
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:58,956
I mean you wouldn't ...

790
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:04,796
I guess you wouldn't want to come.

791
01:14:26,378 --> 01:14:28,087
Give me the pistol.

792
01:14:34,386 --> 01:14:37,597
I says give me over your pistol.

793
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:41,434
I ain't drunk.

794
01:14:43,687 --> 01:14:48,024
Ordinance says you got to turn in
your firearms to my office ...

795
01:14:48,192 --> 01:14:49,442
... day or night.

796
01:14:56,366 --> 01:15:01,454
I guess you didn't see the sign,
because of the weather.

797
01:15:01,705 --> 01:15:02,788
No.

798
01:15:04,124 --> 01:15:05,625
But I ain't ...

799
01:15:06,418 --> 01:15:07,919
I ain't armed.

800
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:13,132
What about your friends upstairs?
They got any pistols?

801
01:15:17,429 --> 01:15:19,222
They ain't armed either.

802
01:15:21,141 --> 01:15:22,642
Spilled your whiskey.

803
01:15:24,728 --> 01:15:26,145
What's your name?

804
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:29,315
William ...

805
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:33,152
... Hendershot.

806
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:39,325
Well, Mr. William Hendershot ...

807
01:15:41,453 --> 01:15:46,582
... what if I was to say you was
a no-good son of a bitch and a liar?

808
01:15:48,168 --> 01:15:53,339
And if I was to say you shit in your
pants because of a cowardly soul ...

809
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:58,678
... I bet you'd show me that pistol
quick and kill me. Isn't that so?

810
01:16:05,435 --> 01:16:07,603
Maybe, yeah, I guess.

811
01:16:09,314 --> 01:16:10,690
But the fact is ...

812
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:14,485
... I ain't carrying no firearm.

813
01:16:14,861 --> 01:16:16,195
Get up.

814
01:16:49,146 --> 01:16:51,397
What's this for,
snakes and such?

815
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:57,570
We don't have any snakes in here,
Mr. Hendershot.

816
01:17:01,908 --> 01:17:06,245
It ain't loaded or ...
Powder's wet.

817
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:11,125
You see, Mr. Beauchamp?

818
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:16,922
This is the trash
I was speaking of!

819
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:28,517
They're in all the saloons
in all your prosperous communities!

820
01:17:28,685 --> 01:17:29,769
Wichita!

821
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:34,899
Over in Cheyenne!

822
01:17:38,111 --> 01:17:39,362
Abilene!

823
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:46,952
But not in the town of Big Whiskey.

824
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:53,209
Hurry up!
You know what to tell Bill.

825
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:57,296
Look for that lone pine.
Miss the pine, you won't find it.

826
01:17:57,547 --> 01:17:59,674
Forget the shirt!
Put the boots on!

827
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:13,562
- What are we going to do about Will?
- Come on, Kid!

828
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:17,066
Let's hope them horses are still there!

829
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:52,518
Let the man out, W.W.

830
01:18:53,311 --> 01:18:57,523
He's desiring to leave the hospitality
of Big Whiskey behind him.

831
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:31,891
Easy!

832
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:36,645
- She's got to turn a dollar a time.
- Why'd they lit out the back window?

833
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:39,398
They seen you beating on their friend.

834
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:44,987
- They come for the billiards, honest.
- Billiards?!

835
01:19:45,697 --> 01:19:49,575
- They were just passing through?
- They was going to Fort Buford.

836
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:52,787
You kicked the shit
out of an innocent man.

837
01:19:53,413 --> 01:19:54,747
Innocent?

838
01:19:55,081 --> 01:19:56,415
Innocent of what?

839
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:27,613
Jesus, Ned! You done this before?

840
01:20:28,865 --> 01:20:30,366
Plenty of times.

841
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:34,245
His pistol must've jammed.

842
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:40,251
Here. Bring that candle in closer.
I can't see.

843
01:20:51,805 --> 01:20:55,808
He wouldn't take no beating
if it hadn't jammed.

844
01:20:55,976 --> 01:20:58,602
He wouldn't give it over
and not shoot.

845
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:04,400
He don't look so good.

846
01:21:06,611 --> 01:21:08,404
He didn't even pull his pistol?

847
01:21:08,655 --> 01:21:12,408
- He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
- I'd have pulled my pistol.

848
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:15,661
You did!
Out of the lady and out the window!

849
01:21:15,912 --> 01:21:18,914
- That was your idea! I --
- We got to go.

850
01:21:19,249 --> 01:21:22,293
What? I'm ready for another advance.

851
01:21:22,502 --> 01:21:26,130
- You'll use it all up.
- No more advances on what you ain't done.

852
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:31,010
Sweetheart, we're just waiting
on this weather to clear!

853
01:21:31,303 --> 01:21:34,889
We're going to need more food!
About three days' worth.

854
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:36,849
Three days?

855
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:39,476
We can kill them tomorrow.

856
01:21:39,686 --> 01:21:43,856
- I don't kill nobody without him.
- We don't need him! We can do it.

857
01:21:44,107 --> 01:21:45,441
Besides ...

858
01:21:45,775 --> 01:21:49,028
... he ain't nothing
but a broken-down pig farmer.

859
01:21:49,195 --> 01:21:52,406
We'll bring food in the morning,
and some whiskey too!

860
01:21:52,657 --> 01:21:55,910
And some medicine if you got any!

861
01:21:56,411 --> 01:21:58,871
Don't it make you sick hearing him?

862
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:00,664
Don't you ladies worry!

863
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:06,462
Me and Ned, we'll kill them two
sons of bitches for you!

864
01:22:12,218 --> 01:22:13,677
Claudia.

865
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:25,522
- Claudia's not here.
- Is that you, Ned?

866
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:28,817
I seen him.

867
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:34,156
I seen the Angel of Death.

868
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:37,242
I seen a river, Ned.

869
01:22:38,244 --> 01:22:42,498
- He's got snake eyes.
- Who's got snake eyes?

870
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,750
It's the Angel of Death.

871
01:22:49,089 --> 01:22:50,965
I'm scared of dying.

872
01:22:51,591 --> 01:22:53,384
Easy, partner.

873
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:55,886
I seen Claudia too.

874
01:22:56,763 --> 01:23:00,015
That's good you saw Claudia, ain't it?

875
01:23:00,517 --> 01:23:03,102
Her face was all covered with worms.

876
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:05,562
Ned, I'm scared.

877
01:23:06,773 --> 01:23:08,232
I'm dying.

878
01:23:12,195 --> 01:23:15,239
You won't --
No, don't tell nobody.

879
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:17,616
Don't tell my kids ...

880
01:23:18,201 --> 01:23:22,037
... none of the things I done.
You hear me?

881
01:23:22,789 --> 01:23:24,123
All right, Will.

882
01:23:41,558 --> 01:23:43,434
He's gonna die, ain't he?

883
01:23:44,936 --> 01:23:46,311
Maybe.

884
01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:48,897
Supposing he does?

885
01:23:52,652 --> 01:23:54,069
We'll bury him.

886
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,155
That ain't what I mean.

887
01:23:59,909 --> 01:24:03,495
You mean, will I help
you kill them cowboys?

888
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:06,582
I can't spot them myself.

889
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:08,542
But you could.

890
01:24:09,127 --> 01:24:13,255
That big bastard, you could spot him
a half-mile off, I bet.

891
01:24:14,674 --> 01:24:16,341
And if I spot him?

892
01:24:17,594 --> 01:24:20,095
Then I ride up close and shoot him.

893
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:24,308
Just like that?

894
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:27,352
I'm a damn killer.
I done it before.

895
01:24:30,356 --> 01:24:32,608
I'm more of a killer than he is.

896
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:36,028
Yeah?

897
01:25:02,388 --> 01:25:05,474
I thought you was an angel.

898
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:07,893
You ain't dead.

899
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:17,820
Some big fellow ...

900
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:21,031
... kicked the hell out of me.

901
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:26,161
I must look like you now.

902
01:25:28,248 --> 01:25:30,499
You don't look nothing like me.

903
01:25:32,418 --> 01:25:34,044
No offense meant.

904
01:25:36,881 --> 01:25:40,217
You got to be the one
those cowboys cut up.

905
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:48,892
My partners, Ned and that Kid ...

906
01:25:49,435 --> 01:25:51,145
... they around?

907
01:25:51,938 --> 01:25:55,023
They went out scouting
when your fever broke.

908
01:25:55,942 --> 01:25:57,067
Scouting?

909
01:25:57,944 --> 01:25:59,903
Out to the Bar T ...

910
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:02,197
... looking for them.

911
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:08,078
How long I been here?

912
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:10,706
Three days.

913
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:13,917
Are you hungry or ...?

914
01:26:14,627 --> 01:26:16,420
Three days?

915
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:18,213
I ought to be ...

916
01:26:30,476 --> 01:26:32,895
I thought I was gone.

917
01:26:35,481 --> 01:26:39,610
I wouldn't normally pay no notice
to high country like this ...

918
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:42,988
... trees,
but I'm sure noticing now.

919
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:46,491
Thought I was dying for sure.

920
01:26:48,328 --> 01:26:49,953
I brought your hat.

921
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:52,831
You left it down at Greely's.

922
01:26:53,499 --> 01:26:54,833
Thanks.

923
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:58,086
That sheriff ...

924
01:26:59,339 --> 01:27:02,090
- He still looking for me?
- Little Bill?

925
01:27:02,342 --> 01:27:05,093
No, he thinks you went south.

926
01:27:08,348 --> 01:27:11,225
Are you really gonna
kill them cowboys?

927
01:27:12,352 --> 01:27:13,644
I guess.

928
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:16,939
Still a payment coming, isn't there?

929
01:27:18,524 --> 01:27:21,276
Them other two, your friends ...

930
01:27:21,819 --> 01:27:24,863
... they been taking
advances on the payment.

931
01:27:25,698 --> 01:27:27,115
Advances?

932
01:27:29,035 --> 01:27:32,162
- Free ones.
- Free ones?

933
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:35,958
Alice and Silky been
giving them free ones.

934
01:27:37,877 --> 01:27:39,127
I see.

935
01:27:42,882 --> 01:27:44,967
Would you like a free one?

936
01:27:53,226 --> 01:27:56,520
No. I guess not.

937
01:27:57,313 --> 01:28:00,983
I didn't mean with me.
I meant ...

938
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:05,904
... Alice and Silky would be happy
to give you a free one if you wanted.

939
01:28:06,072 --> 01:28:08,323
That's all I meant.

940
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:12,077
I didn't mean ...

941
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:16,415
... I didn't want a free one
because you been cut up and all.

942
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:21,169
What I said about you looking like me,
that ain't true.

943
01:28:21,754 --> 01:28:23,588
You ain't ugly like me.

944
01:28:25,049 --> 01:28:28,552
It's just that we both got scars.

945
01:28:30,722 --> 01:28:34,224
You're a beautiful woman,
and if I wanted a free one ...

946
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:38,103
... I'd want it with you
more than the other two.

947
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:41,857
It's just that ...

948
01:28:42,608 --> 01:28:45,027
... I can't on account of my wife.

949
01:28:51,617 --> 01:28:52,868
Your wife?

950
01:28:53,786 --> 01:28:57,247
Yeah. You see?

951
01:29:01,961 --> 01:29:03,795
I admire you for that.

952
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:06,923
For being true to your wife.

953
01:29:07,967 --> 01:29:10,093
I've known a lot of men ...

954
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:13,764
... who weren't.

955
01:29:16,142 --> 01:29:17,601
I suppose.

956
01:29:24,108 --> 01:29:25,901
Is she back in Kansas?

957
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:29,071
Yeah.

958
01:29:30,114 --> 01:29:32,783
She's watching over my young ones.

959
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:41,124
- Hang on!
- Get the damn iron!

960
01:29:50,927 --> 01:29:52,677
Jesus, fellas!

961
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:06,817
Jesus, boys, my leg's broke!

962
01:30:08,861 --> 01:30:10,445
I'm pinned, boys!

963
01:30:11,864 --> 01:30:13,490
Better finish him, Ned.

964
01:30:13,908 --> 01:30:16,034
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?

965
01:30:16,327 --> 01:30:18,203
He got the boy's horse.

966
01:30:18,913 --> 01:30:21,289
Finish him before he gets clear.

967
01:30:24,043 --> 01:30:25,961
Get behind them rocks.

968
01:30:26,712 --> 01:30:28,004
Get over there!

969
01:30:31,384 --> 01:30:35,512
What happened? He ain't killed?!
What's going on?

970
01:30:35,888 --> 01:30:38,348
He gets in those rocks,
we won't get him.

971
01:30:38,724 --> 01:30:41,184
- Unless we go down there.
- What rocks?

972
01:30:41,561 --> 01:30:44,354
Why don't you shoot?
What's going on?

973
01:30:49,318 --> 01:30:50,360
Shoot!

974
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:06,334
I ain't very good with one of these.

975
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:14,384
Keep going, Davey! The rocks!

976
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:17,929
Did you get him?

977
01:31:18,764 --> 01:31:20,015
Where is he?

978
01:31:20,266 --> 01:31:27,355
How many more shots do I have?

979
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:34,196
- Two.
- Two.

980
01:31:43,748 --> 01:31:45,207
Did you get him?

981
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:04,434
Here, reload this.

982
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:07,938
- You missed him.
- I got him.

983
01:32:08,981 --> 01:32:11,816
They shot me, boys.

984
01:32:11,984 --> 01:32:13,276
He ain't killed.

985
01:32:13,986 --> 01:32:15,737
Maybe, maybe not.

986
01:32:16,322 --> 01:32:18,573
Got him through the gut, I think.

987
01:32:22,995 --> 01:32:24,621
Think he'll die?

988
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:29,626
You think we killed him?

989
01:32:36,425 --> 01:32:37,801
Yeah.

990
01:32:39,053 --> 01:32:42,347
We killed him, I guess.

991
01:32:46,018 --> 01:32:47,936
I'm dying, boys!

992
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:52,274
Then you shouldn't have cut up
no woman, you asshole!

993
01:32:57,863 --> 01:33:00,574
Jesus, I'm so thirsty!

994
01:33:03,369 --> 01:33:06,621
Give me some water, please!

995
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:08,373
Please, Slim!

996
01:33:09,542 --> 01:33:11,167
I'm bleeding, Slim!

997
01:33:15,381 --> 01:33:18,133
Give him a drink of water,
goddamn it!

998
01:33:22,221 --> 01:33:26,308
Give him some water, for chrissake!
We ain't gonna shoot!

999
01:33:28,352 --> 01:33:31,605
- You ain't gonna shoot?
- No.

1000
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:35,483
Hold on, Davey-boy!

1001
01:33:36,736 --> 01:33:38,194
Here I come now!

1002
01:33:44,744 --> 01:33:46,703
Don't shoot me,
you bastards!

1003
01:33:50,249 --> 01:33:51,541
Shit!

1004
01:34:01,427 --> 01:34:03,053
They take him water?

1005
01:34:05,765 --> 01:34:08,058
Jesus, Johnny! They shot him!

1006
01:34:08,267 --> 01:34:09,893
Hold on now!

1007
01:34:18,653 --> 01:34:22,197
You murdering bastards!
You killed our Davey-boy!

1008
01:34:31,123 --> 01:34:32,957
When will we double back?

1009
01:34:33,668 --> 01:34:35,418
After a ways.

1010
01:34:36,796 --> 01:34:38,046
Not me.

1011
01:34:38,798 --> 01:34:44,135
- I'm heading back down to Kansas.
- We got to kill the other one first.

1012
01:34:44,303 --> 01:34:48,431
With any luck, we'll find him
by nightfall or in the morning.

1013
01:34:48,599 --> 01:34:52,477
We'll shoot him and head back
with the money.

1014
01:34:53,646 --> 01:34:56,815
- Do you want the Spencer?
- It's no time to quit.

1015
01:34:57,108 --> 01:34:59,567
- You'll lose your share.
- Shut up!

1016
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:02,570
I'll see you, Will.
So long, Kid.

1017
01:35:11,038 --> 01:35:14,624
Here. I ain't no good
with that damn thing.

1018
01:35:15,126 --> 01:35:19,838
Me and the Kid'll head over
to that ranch and we'll shoot him.

1019
01:35:20,297 --> 01:35:24,175
We'll meet up with you,
get our money, and go back together.

1020
01:35:24,802 --> 01:35:27,262
Suppose he don't go back
to the ranch?

1021
01:35:27,638 --> 01:35:31,641
He ain't going into town
or stay out in the open country.

1022
01:35:31,976 --> 01:35:33,935
He'll hole up at that ranch.

1023
01:35:35,813 --> 01:35:37,272
I ain't waiting.

1024
01:35:37,815 --> 01:35:40,400
I'll look in on your young ones.

1025
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:50,160
Forget what the Kid said
about the money.

1026
01:35:50,369 --> 01:35:52,912
I'll bring your share.

1027
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:57,292
Kid's full of shit.

1028
01:36:25,488 --> 01:36:27,697
Just doing some repairs up here.

1029
01:36:28,073 --> 01:36:29,908
They killed one of them cowboys.

1030
01:36:33,996 --> 01:36:35,246
Shit!

1031
01:36:36,749 --> 01:36:41,294
Parson said he saw three men,
right after sunup, headed east.

1032
01:36:41,545 --> 01:36:46,007
One was on a dun and another
was on a flea-bitten gray.

1033
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:50,845
He didn't know what the third one
was on, maybe an appaloosa.

1034
01:36:51,096 --> 01:36:55,183
Amos says to ask if the county
will pay for feed for all the horses.

1035
01:36:55,434 --> 01:36:58,728
Witherspoon won't sell us
no more shells without pay.

1036
01:36:58,979 --> 01:37:00,605
Hell, use my dogs!

1037
01:37:00,856 --> 01:37:03,107
Then the county's got
to be responsible.

1038
01:37:03,984 --> 01:37:08,530
Get on out there to the Bar T
and make sure that other cowboy ...

1039
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:11,366
... stays put
and don't expose himself.

1040
01:37:21,377 --> 01:37:23,711
I didn't think they'd really do it.

1041
01:37:24,338 --> 01:37:27,215
Think they come up
from Kansas to fuck us?

1042
01:37:30,594 --> 01:37:33,972
That Kid, he's just a boy
and the other one ...

1043
01:37:34,223 --> 01:37:37,100
... Will, the nice one,
being so true to his wife ...

1044
01:37:37,351 --> 01:37:39,894
Wife?
He ain't got no wife.

1045
01:37:40,396 --> 01:37:43,231
- Yes, he does. He --
- He ain't got no wife.

1046
01:37:43,732 --> 01:37:45,567
Not above ground, anyways.

1047
01:37:51,657 --> 01:37:53,074
Murdering whores!

1048
01:37:54,243 --> 01:37:57,662
He had it coming!
He had it coming for what he done!

1049
01:37:57,997 --> 01:38:01,833
And the other one too!
Both of them for what they done!

1050
01:38:12,011 --> 01:38:13,428
We got one!

1051
01:38:15,848 --> 01:38:18,516
We got one, sheriff!
Out by Cow Creek!

1052
01:38:18,851 --> 01:38:21,227
- Is he alive?
- Hell, yeah!

1053
01:38:21,478 --> 01:38:26,107
Bunch of us from Bar T went looking
because they killed one of our own.

1054
01:38:26,442 --> 01:38:29,611
Come across the bastard
on a roan heading south.

1055
01:38:29,945 --> 01:38:31,195
He admit it?

1056
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:35,617
No. But I guess he will soon enough.
Had a Spencer rifle on him.

1057
01:38:36,368 --> 01:38:37,869
They messing him up?

1058
01:38:39,455 --> 01:38:40,955
Little bit.

1059
01:38:44,627 --> 01:38:48,630
Get out there. Find out what happened
to those other two!

1060
01:39:11,737 --> 01:39:13,905
See anything out there, Buck?

1061
01:39:14,156 --> 01:39:17,992
Hell, yes!
Seen about 200 fellows packing rifles.

1062
01:39:18,243 --> 01:39:22,538
Got the place surrounded.
Say they want Quick Mike's ass.

1063
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:26,084
I said, "How much?" They says, "Five."
I said, "Dollars?"

1064
01:39:26,335 --> 01:39:27,585
They said, "Cents."

1065
01:39:27,836 --> 01:39:29,337
I said, "Sold."

1066
01:39:31,006 --> 01:39:32,674
Well, I ain't worried!

1067
01:39:33,008 --> 01:39:36,511
Because I got me some protection.

1068
01:40:01,036 --> 01:40:03,329
- Tell you where them others is?
- Nope.

1069
01:40:03,497 --> 01:40:07,291
- Any names?
- Only told us his name, Ned Roundtree.

1070
01:40:09,878 --> 01:40:11,129
Bring him in.

1071
01:40:14,133 --> 01:40:17,802
You'll want to tell me
and Mr. Beauchamp here ...

1072
01:40:17,970 --> 01:40:20,179
... all about your two friends.

1073
01:40:20,597 --> 01:40:25,935
I'll want the names and whereabouts
of those son of a bitches.

1074
01:40:39,616 --> 01:40:41,242
Sure is ripe.

1075
01:40:42,911 --> 01:40:44,746
Going to get a lot riper.

1076
01:40:46,165 --> 01:40:47,749
Think he's still in there?

1077
01:40:49,334 --> 01:40:51,002
He's in there.

1078
01:40:51,837 --> 01:40:55,673
He's holding on to his shit
like it was money.

1079
01:40:55,841 --> 01:40:57,258
He's in there.

1080
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:01,095
Tell me right off if you see him.

1081
01:41:02,347 --> 01:41:04,766
You won't shoot him your own self?

1082
01:41:04,933 --> 01:41:07,643
You can shoot him.

1083
01:41:44,264 --> 01:41:47,308
Now you and Mr. Quincy and ...

1084
01:41:47,559 --> 01:41:50,019
What was the young fellow's name?

1085
01:41:53,774 --> 01:41:55,358
Elroy Tate.

1086
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:02,573
No, that's not what you said.

1087
01:42:03,033 --> 01:42:05,993
- Hell if it ain't!
- No, you said:

1088
01:42:06,578 --> 01:42:09,330
"Elroy Quincy out of Medicine Hat ...

1089
01:42:11,083 --> 01:42:13,835
... and Henry Tate out of Cheyenne."

1090
01:42:14,336 --> 01:42:18,172
Hell if I did.

1091
01:42:20,384 --> 01:42:23,719
Go get them whores that pumped
these boys that night.

1092
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:26,013
Strawberry Alice and Silky?

1093
01:42:26,348 --> 01:42:28,015
Go on and get them!

1094
01:42:37,067 --> 01:42:41,279
Them whores are going to tell
different lies than you.

1095
01:42:42,531 --> 01:42:47,326
And when their lies
ain't the same as your lies ...

1096
01:42:48,036 --> 01:42:50,246
Well, I ain't going to hurt no woman.

1097
01:42:51,373 --> 01:42:53,332
But I'm going to hurt you.

1098
01:42:55,794 --> 01:42:57,962
Not gentle like before ...

1099
01:42:59,506 --> 01:43:01,257
... but bad.

1100
01:43:17,524 --> 01:43:18,983
Where you going?

1101
01:43:19,151 --> 01:43:21,319
- The shithouse.
- Let me finish.

1102
01:43:21,653 --> 01:43:23,905
To protect me while I take a dump?

1103
01:43:24,156 --> 01:43:26,324
- You'll get bushwhacked.
- I'll fart on them.

1104
01:43:26,575 --> 01:43:29,744
- I'll go.
- Yeah, you can wipe my ass, Thirsty.

1105
01:43:29,995 --> 01:43:33,873
Hell with him. He ain't polite,
he should get shot.

1106
01:43:37,336 --> 01:43:38,669
Is that him?

1107
01:43:38,921 --> 01:43:40,546
Yeah, that's him.

1108
01:43:44,343 --> 01:43:48,221
All right, Kid. Go get him.
He's all yours.

1109
01:44:23,715 --> 01:44:24,840
Assassins!

1110
01:44:28,845 --> 01:44:30,221
Shoot him!

1111
01:44:45,862 --> 01:44:47,405
Come on, goddamn it!

1112
01:45:04,506 --> 01:45:05,923
Did you get him?

1113
01:45:18,812 --> 01:45:19,895
Cover me.

1114
01:45:22,441 --> 01:45:24,817
- I can't see them!
- Just shoot!

1115
01:46:01,897 --> 01:46:04,482
Was it like that in the old days?

1116
01:46:05,150 --> 01:46:07,693
Everybody riding out, shooting ...

1117
01:46:08,153 --> 01:46:12,073
... smoke all over, folks yelling,
bullets whizzing by?

1118
01:46:13,909 --> 01:46:15,242
I guess so.

1119
01:46:19,331 --> 01:46:21,832
Shit, I thought they'd get us.

1120
01:46:23,001 --> 01:46:25,002
I was even scared a little.

1121
01:46:25,337 --> 01:46:26,587
For a minute.

1122
01:46:29,341 --> 01:46:31,342
You ever scared in them days?

1123
01:46:33,595 --> 01:46:35,012
I can't remember.

1124
01:46:36,348 --> 01:46:39,392
I was drunk most of the time.

1125
01:46:45,273 --> 01:46:47,858
I shot that fucker three times!

1126
01:46:49,361 --> 01:46:53,280
He was taking a shit,
went for his pistol and I blazed away.

1127
01:46:53,448 --> 01:46:54,824
First shot ...

1128
01:46:56,618 --> 01:46:58,828
... I got him right in the chest.

1129
01:47:02,541 --> 01:47:05,584
- Say, Will?
- Yeah?

1130
01:47:08,046 --> 01:47:09,630
That was the first one.

1131
01:47:11,049 --> 01:47:12,425
First one what?

1132
01:47:14,803 --> 01:47:16,637
First one I ever killed.

1133
01:47:18,181 --> 01:47:19,265
Yeah?

1134
01:47:20,642 --> 01:47:23,060
You know how I said I shot five men?

1135
01:47:24,479 --> 01:47:26,063
It weren't true.

1136
01:47:28,483 --> 01:47:31,777
That Mexican with the knife?

1137
01:47:31,987 --> 01:47:36,323
I just busted his leg with a shovel.
I didn't kill him or nothing.

1138
01:47:39,619 --> 01:47:42,955
You sure killed
the hell out of that fellow today.

1139
01:47:44,791 --> 01:47:46,375
Hell, yeah!

1140
01:47:49,838 --> 01:47:52,840
Killed the hell out of him, didn't I?

1141
01:47:53,091 --> 01:47:56,135
Three shots and he was taking a shit.

1142
01:48:02,684 --> 01:48:04,059
Take a drink, Kid.

1143
01:48:14,946 --> 01:48:16,822
Jesus Christ!

1144
01:48:29,294 --> 01:48:31,170
It don't seem real.

1145
01:48:32,714 --> 01:48:35,841
How he ain't gonna
never breath again, ever.

1146
01:48:36,801 --> 01:48:38,135
How he's dead.

1147
01:48:39,971 --> 01:48:42,556
And the other one too.

1148
01:48:44,351 --> 01:48:47,645
On account of pulling a trigger.

1149
01:48:49,564 --> 01:48:52,858
It's a hell of a thing, killing a man.

1150
01:48:54,069 --> 01:48:56,904
You take away all he's got ...

1151
01:48:57,072 --> 01:48:59,281
... and all he's ever gonna have.

1152
01:49:04,746 --> 01:49:06,747
I guess they had it coming.

1153
01:49:12,754 --> 01:49:15,005
We all have it coming, Kid.

1154
01:49:29,604 --> 01:49:32,523
I was watching
that you weren't followed.

1155
01:49:33,942 --> 01:49:39,154
Silky and Faith rode off to the east
and two deputies followed them.

1156
01:49:44,869 --> 01:49:48,414
- You want to help me count this?
- I trust you.

1157
01:49:48,665 --> 01:49:51,083
Don't go trusting me too much.

1158
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:55,296
In fact, we'll give Ned his share
together.

1159
01:49:55,547 --> 01:49:58,173
You'll know I ain't holding out on you.

1160
01:49:58,425 --> 01:49:59,800
Ned's share?

1161
01:50:02,762 --> 01:50:04,805
He went south.
We'll catch up.

1162
01:50:05,557 --> 01:50:07,349
He's dead.

1163
01:50:10,729 --> 01:50:13,314
What do you mean, dead?

1164
01:50:13,481 --> 01:50:16,275
He went south yesterday.
He ain't dead.

1165
01:50:16,818 --> 01:50:19,403
They killed him.
I thought you knew.

1166
01:50:19,696 --> 01:50:21,572
Nobody killed Ned!

1167
01:50:21,823 --> 01:50:24,533
He didn't kill anyone.
He went south!

1168
01:50:24,701 --> 01:50:26,785
Why would anybody kill Ned?

1169
01:50:29,372 --> 01:50:30,623
Who killed him?

1170
01:50:31,416 --> 01:50:32,666
Little Bill.

1171
01:50:33,001 --> 01:50:35,502
The Bar T boys caught him ...

1172
01:50:35,879 --> 01:50:37,921
... and Little Bill beat him up.

1173
01:50:38,089 --> 01:50:43,010
He was making him answer questions,
beating him up. Then Ned just died.

1174
01:50:43,345 --> 01:50:45,888
They got a sign on him
says he was a killer.

1175
01:50:46,056 --> 01:50:47,514
A sign on him?

1176
01:50:48,266 --> 01:50:49,850
In front of Greely's.

1177
01:50:50,185 --> 01:50:52,436
A sign on him in front of Greely's!

1178
01:50:56,858 --> 01:51:00,152
These questions he was asking ...

1179
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:02,571
... what kind were they?

1180
01:51:05,325 --> 01:51:08,702
About where you and him was.

1181
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:10,371
Then what?

1182
01:51:11,456 --> 01:51:15,793
A cowboy come in saying you killed
Quick Mike in the shithouse.

1183
01:51:16,795 --> 01:51:19,672
So Little Bill killed him
for what we done?

1184
01:51:19,923 --> 01:51:21,298
Not on purpose.

1185
01:51:22,217 --> 01:51:26,220
But he started hurting him worse.
Making him tell stuff.

1186
01:51:26,554 --> 01:51:28,097
First, Ned wouldn't talk.

1187
01:51:28,890 --> 01:51:33,769
Then Little Bill hurt him so bad,
he said who you was.

1188
01:51:34,729 --> 01:51:38,857
He said how you was really
William Munny out of Missouri.

1189
01:51:39,025 --> 01:51:42,027
Little Bill said, "The one
who dynamited ...

1190
01:51:42,278 --> 01:51:45,614
... the railroad in '69,
killing women and children?"

1191
01:51:45,782 --> 01:51:48,909
Ned said you done a lot worse.
Said you was ...

1192
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:52,830
... more cold-blooded than Will Bonney.
Said if he hurt Ned again ...

1193
01:51:53,081 --> 01:51:58,168
... you'd come kill him
like you killed a U.S. marshal in '70.

1194
01:52:02,924 --> 01:52:06,135
That didn't scare him, did it?

1195
01:52:07,095 --> 01:52:08,721
No, sir.

1196
01:52:16,354 --> 01:52:18,188
Give me your Schofield.

1197
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:19,857
What for, Will?

1198
01:52:20,024 --> 01:52:23,902
- Give it to me.
- Yeah. Sure.

1199
01:52:28,491 --> 01:52:30,284
You want it, keep it.

1200
01:52:30,535 --> 01:52:31,910
I won't use it.

1201
01:52:34,497 --> 01:52:36,582
I won't kill nobody no more.

1202
01:52:40,170 --> 01:52:41,795
I ain't like you, Will.

1203
01:52:45,842 --> 01:52:48,969
You better ride on back, miss.

1204
01:52:52,515 --> 01:52:55,100
Go on, keep all of it.
It's yours.

1205
01:52:55,977 --> 01:52:58,854
What about spectacles
and fancy clothes?

1206
01:52:59,939 --> 01:53:02,941
I'd rather be blind and ragged
than dead.

1207
01:53:04,319 --> 01:53:08,280
You don't have to worry, Kid.
I ain't going to kill you.

1208
01:53:08,782 --> 01:53:10,866
You're the only friend I got.

1209
01:53:18,792 --> 01:53:23,337
Take this money and give my half
and Ned's half to my kids.

1210
01:53:23,922 --> 01:53:27,466
Tell them if I ain't back in a week,
to give half to Sally.

1211
01:53:27,717 --> 01:53:30,427
You keep the rest.
Get them spectacles.

1212
01:53:30,678 --> 01:53:32,429
You'll go kill Little Bill?

1213
01:53:32,889 --> 01:53:36,975
Stay clear of folks you see.
There'll be a lot out to hang you.

1214
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:38,852
Get going.

1215
01:54:22,647 --> 01:54:26,900
I'll say this just one more time,
so don't ask me again!

1216
01:54:27,068 --> 01:54:32,739
Those on today's posse got one drink
coming from the county budget!

1217
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:36,994
And those who rode yesterday
get one for that too.

1218
01:54:38,288 --> 01:54:39,830
Hold it!

1219
01:54:40,081 --> 01:54:44,543
That's two! After that, it comes
out of your own pocket! You hear?

1220
01:54:44,794 --> 01:54:47,838
- Yes, sir.
- We'll pull out early in the morning.

1221
01:54:48,256 --> 01:54:52,634
We'll chase them clear to Texas,
so don't spend too much money.

1222
01:54:53,595 --> 01:54:56,221
We'll divide up into four parties!

1223
01:54:56,472 --> 01:55:00,434
We'll hit all the farms and trails
in a big circle.

1224
01:55:00,685 --> 01:55:05,022
We're bound to find somebody
who's seen these skunks.

1225
01:55:22,457 --> 01:55:24,708
Who owns this shithole?

1226
01:55:34,218 --> 01:55:37,596
You, fat man. Speak up.

1227
01:55:40,224 --> 01:55:42,684
I own this establishment.

1228
01:55:45,146 --> 01:55:48,815
I bought it from Greely for $1,000.

1229
01:55:50,234 --> 01:55:51,860
Better clear out.

1230
01:55:54,822 --> 01:55:57,783
Hold it!

1231
01:56:07,001 --> 01:56:10,087
Sir, you are a cowardly
son of a bitch!

1232
01:56:11,089 --> 01:56:13,048
You just shot an unarmed man.

1233
01:56:13,508 --> 01:56:15,550
He should've armed himself ...

1234
01:56:15,802 --> 01:56:18,553
... if he's going to decorate his saloon
with my friend.

1235
01:56:19,263 --> 01:56:22,099
You'd be William Munny
out of Missouri ...

1236
01:56:22,266 --> 01:56:24,267
... killer of women and children.

1237
01:56:24,936 --> 01:56:26,353
That's right.

1238
01:56:28,064 --> 01:56:30,023
I killed women and children.

1239
01:56:31,567 --> 01:56:35,445
Killed just about everything
that walks or crawls.

1240
01:56:36,698 --> 01:56:39,366
And I'm here to kill you, Little Bill.

1241
01:56:40,201 --> 01:56:42,536
For what you did to Ned.

1242
01:56:46,708 --> 01:56:48,625
You boys better move away.

1243
01:56:59,095 --> 01:57:03,265
All right, gentlemen.
He's got one barrel left.

1244
01:57:04,142 --> 01:57:06,309
When he fires it,
use your pistols ...

1245
01:57:06,561 --> 01:57:10,814
... and shoot him down
like the mangy scoundrel he is!

1246
01:57:23,911 --> 01:57:26,371
Misfire! Kill the son of a bitch!

1247
01:58:03,201 --> 01:58:07,329
Any man don't want to get killed,
better clear on out the back.

1248
01:58:51,999 --> 01:58:53,667
I'm shot! I'm shot!

1249
01:58:54,168 --> 01:58:55,502
You ain't shot.

1250
01:59:01,551 --> 01:59:04,511
I don't have a gun.
I am not armed.

1251
01:59:05,930 --> 01:59:07,430
Pick up that rifle.

1252
01:59:09,392 --> 01:59:10,684
Pick it up.

1253
01:59:13,062 --> 01:59:14,146
Shells too.

1254
01:59:27,368 --> 01:59:28,827
You killed Little Bill.

1255
01:59:30,371 --> 01:59:31,872
Sure you ain't armed?

1256
01:59:34,292 --> 01:59:36,209
I'm not.
I don't have a gun.

1257
01:59:36,460 --> 01:59:39,171
I've never had a gun.
I'm a writer!

1258
01:59:40,631 --> 01:59:42,132
A writer?

1259
01:59:42,925 --> 01:59:45,051
- Letters and such?
- Books.

1260
01:59:45,761 --> 01:59:47,304
Books.

1261
01:59:47,471 --> 01:59:51,391
I don't believe it, you killed five men.
Single-handed.

1262
01:59:59,984 --> 02:00:02,944
- That's a Spencer rifle, right?
- Right.

1263
02:00:11,120 --> 02:00:12,537
Who'd you kill first?

1264
02:00:16,459 --> 02:00:18,710
"When confronted by superior numbers ...

1265
02:00:18,961 --> 02:00:23,006
... an experienced gunfighter will
fire on the best shot first."

1266
02:00:23,174 --> 02:00:27,510
Little Bill said that.
You probably killed him first.

1267
02:00:27,678 --> 02:00:29,721
I was lucky in the order.

1268
02:00:30,681 --> 02:00:34,684
I'm always lucky
when it comes to killing folks.

1269
02:00:35,561 --> 02:00:39,314
That so? Who was next?
Clyde, right?

1270
02:00:39,565 --> 02:00:42,275
You killed Clyde,
or it was Deputy Andy --

1271
02:00:42,526 --> 02:00:45,153
All I can tell you is,
who'll be last.

1272
02:01:21,816 --> 02:01:23,775
I don't deserve this.

1273
02:01:25,820 --> 02:01:27,404
To die like this.

1274
02:01:30,241 --> 02:01:32,325
I was building a house.

1275
02:01:33,244 --> 02:01:35,912
Deserve's got nothing to do with it.

1276
02:01:38,624 --> 02:01:42,043
I'll see you in hell, William Munny.

1277
02:01:48,467 --> 02:01:49,884
Yeah.

1278
02:02:21,375 --> 02:02:23,501
All right, I'm coming out!

1279
02:02:23,919 --> 02:02:26,713
Any man I see out there, I'll kill him!

1280
02:02:27,298 --> 02:02:29,799
Anyone takes a shot at me ...

1281
02:02:30,509 --> 02:02:35,347
... I'm not only going to kill him,
but his wife and all his friends.

1282
02:02:35,681 --> 02:02:37,932
And burn his damn house down!

1283
02:02:45,274 --> 02:02:47,067
Nobody better shoot!

1284
02:03:02,625 --> 02:03:04,709
Charley, go ahead.
Shoot him!

1285
02:03:18,849 --> 02:03:20,183
I can't.

1286
02:03:20,643 --> 02:03:23,436
Hell, no!
I ain't no deputy!

1287
02:03:43,332 --> 02:03:45,959
You better bury Ned right!

1288
02:03:46,544 --> 02:03:50,255
You better not cut up
nor otherwise harm no whores!

1289
02:03:54,176 --> 02:03:58,555
Or I'll come back and kill every
one of you sons of bitches.
