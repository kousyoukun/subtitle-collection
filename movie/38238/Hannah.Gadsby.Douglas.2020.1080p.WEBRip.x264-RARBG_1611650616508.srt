‎谢谢
Thank you.

00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,070
‎非常感谢
Thank you so much.

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,540
‎哈啰
Hello.

15
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,290
‎瞧瞧这个
Look at this!

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,910
‎瞧瞧这个
Look at this.

17
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:46,710
‎那是…
That...

18
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,920
‎这是完全用蜡笔做的狗
That is a dog made entirely out of crayons.

19
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,720
‎我不需要
I don't need that.

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,640
‎连我现在都是问题
I'm part of the problem now.

21
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,680
‎这是我的黄金马桶
That's my gold toilet.

22
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,940
‎我根本不打算到美国
I had no plans to make it in America.

23
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,310
‎这不在我的计划之内
This was not on my agenda.

24
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,780
‎然后是因为我写了‎一出节目《娜娜》
And then what happened though is I wrote a show called Nanette,

25
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,610
是吧…
right, that...

26
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,570
‎然后…
Well, then...

27
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,580
‎这很明显 是吧
That's clear, isn't it?

28
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,790
‎所以你们才都来此
That's why you're here.

29
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,870
‎你们来这里 ‎不是因为我先前的旧作 对吧
You're not here because of my back catalog of prior, are you?

30
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,420
‎而这也正是要问的问题 ‎如果你是因为《娜娜》来此
Which does beg the question, if you're here because of Nanette...

31
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,420
‎为什么
why?

32
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,590
我 ???
I ???

33
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,760
‎别误会我的意思 ‎那是个很棒的节目 很有实力
Like, don't get me wrong, it was a good show. Solid bit of work.

34
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,010
‎我也非常喜欢
I'm quite fond.

35
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,810
‎但这是个口味特定的特别节目
But it was a particular show of a very particular flavor.

36
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,890
‎如果是这原因让你来… ‎你究竟还想看什么
And if that is what has brought... What the fuck are you expecting from this show?

37
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,070
‎很抱歉 如果是要看更多创伤 ‎我已经都讲完了
Because I'm sorry, if it's more trauma, I... I am fresh out.

38
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:58,910
‎要是我早知道创伤是非常受欢迎的喜剧内容
Had I known just how wildly popular trauma was going to be in the context of comedy,

39
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,240
‎我该好好规划一下我的创伤
I might have budgeted my shit a bit better.

40
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,920
‎真的啦 ‎我可以靠创伤创业
Honestly. I could have built quite the career out of it.

41
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,290
At least a trilogy.

42
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,250
‎至少分三部曲

43
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:11,640
‎但我像个白痴 把我的创伤蛋全都放在同一个篮子里
But I went and put all my trauma eggs into one basket like a fucking idiot,

44
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,880
‎结果我傻呼呼地在这
and now here we are.

45
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,670
‎你们还想听
You want more?

46
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,160
‎就这阵掌声 我好奇问一下
Just out of curiosity, by round of applause,

47
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,930
‎谁没看过《娜娜》
who has not seen Nanette?

48
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,230
‎那我就更搞不清楚 ‎你为何会在这里了
Even less of an idea why the fuck you're here.

49
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,150
‎当然 欢迎
I mean, welcome.

50
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,940
‎你很不错 愿意试一下
Good on you, taking a punt.

51
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,690
‎别担心 没关系
And-- And don't worry, it's fine.

52
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,070
‎这节目不是看你 ‎有没有看过《娜娜》
This show does not depend on you having seen Nanette.

53
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,160
‎我没那么有自信 但是…
I'm not that kind of confident, but...

54
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,990
‎就边走边瞧了
We'll see what happens.

55
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,240
‎但除了创伤
But other than trauma,

56
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,790
‎我根本不知道大家 ‎对这节目期待什么
you know, I have no way of telling what people are expecting from this show.

57
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,210
‎但我所决定的倒是非常可能
Right? But what I've decided is possible

58
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,420
‎就是让我直接告诉你
is for me to just tell you.

59
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,130
‎接下来就是如此
And that's what's gonna happen.

60
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,760
‎这就是我满足你期待的方法
That's how I'm going to meet your expectations.

61
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,180
‎为了你们 现在做调整
-By adjusting them for you now. -

62
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,300
‎所以他们绝对是你想看到的
So they are exactly what you're gonna get.

63
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,060
‎然后我满足你 你会说“她好厉害” ‎是 我的确是
Then I'll meet them and you'll go, "She's very good." And, yes, I am,

64
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,020
但我作弊
but I cheat.

65
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,390
So that's what's gonna happen before the show even begins, right?
‎所以甚至节目还没开始 ‎就会发生这样的事 对吗

66
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,190
‎我将向你们巨细靡遗的描述
I'm going to give you a very detailed, blow-by-blow description

67
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,400
‎这节目将要展开的内容
of exactly how the show is going to unfold.

68
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,490
‎的确有这样的期待存在
Now this setting of expectations does go on a bit.

69
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,410
‎让我得要删掉实际的节目才能符合 但是…
I've had to cut the actual show in order to fit it in, but...

70
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,080
‎我相信很值得
I believe it's worth it, you know?

71
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,830
‎满足你的期待 就是我的职责
Like, to be able to meet your expectations, it's my job.

72
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,830
‎我们就面对现实吧 ‎这是我的第二张期待的畅销
And let's face it, this is my difficult second album,

73
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,210
‎这也是我第十‎以及有些人的第一次
that is also my tenth and some people's first.

74
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,960
‎其实压力超大
You know, it's a lot of pressure.

75
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,960
‎来看看你的期待吧
So let's set your expectations.

76
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,130
‎节目开始时… ‎
When the show begins...

77
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,840
节目真正开始时…
When the show actually begins...

78
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,640
‎这还不是 别紧张
This is not it. Don't panic.

79
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,390
‎开始的时候 我会用‎生活观察的笑料作为开始
When it begins, I'm gonna kick things off with a bit of observational comedy.

80
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,400
‎是吧 就象是“你们有没有注意过… ‎那怎么了 ”
Right? A bit of, you know, "Have you ever noticed... What's up with that?"

81
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,440
‎我就会开始说这鬼话 ‎
That shit. That's what I'm starting with.

82
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,610
‎这其实不是很好 我也完全对你们老实说
And look, it's not very good, I'm gonna be perfectly honest with you,

83
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,490
因为我其实观察力很差
because I'm not very observant.

84
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,450
‎基本上呢
-Typically speaking... -

85
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,320
就是过目即忘
vague as fuck, right?

86
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:09,290
‎这么说吧 我的观察就是美国人
Now, fair warning, my observations will be about Americans,

87
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,660
‎普遍说来 就是你们大家
which is, broadly speaking, you lot.

88
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,710
Right? So...

89
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,750
‎对吧 所以…

90
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,250
‎抱歉 取笑美国人
And-- And, sorry, but making fun of Americans

91
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,960
仍旧技术上来说很有梗
is still technically punching up,

92
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,590
‎虽然就快没机会了
although that window is closing.

93
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,380
‎的确
It is.

94
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,260
‎所以…
And so...

95
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,350
‎我只是顺手之便
I'm just making hay, you know.

96
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,060
‎因为我不会说俄文 ‎所以我真的得…
'Cause I can't speak Russian, so I've really gotta...

97
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,100
‎抓住机会
get it in while I can. I don't know.

98
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,440
‎我也该警告你
I should just also warn you,

99
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,850
‎在我嘲笑美国人期间
during the bit where I make fun of Americans...

100
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,080
‎你可能会感觉受伤
your feelings will smart,

101
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,920
‎因为我就是会直接取笑
because I will be making fun of you there.

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,800
‎我希望你们先有心理准备 好吗
I just need you to expect that, right?

103
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,760
‎我绝对会耻笑 这是我老家的说法 ‎你也不会在乎
I will be taking the absolute piss, as we say back home, not that you care.

104
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,050
‎然后你坐在那里 ‎可能反应像这样…
And so you'll be sitting there, just going, "Oh."

105
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,140
‎公平说来 ‎我不想否定你的感觉
And fair enough. I don't want to deny your feelings.

106
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,940
‎拜托 拥抱你的感受 ‎彻底感受一下
Have them, please. Let them run through you, definitely.

107
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,690
‎但我强烈建议
But what I would suggest, strongly,

108
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,610
别钻进牛角尖里
is that you do not invest in those feelings.

109
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,980
‎别让情绪冲昏你的头 ‎因为这个节目
Don't let them get a grip on you, because what this show is,

110
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,530
‎应该是个浪漫喜剧
if anything, is a romantic comedy.

111
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,660
‎为了节目最后 ‎不好的开始就至关重要了
So it's just, to that end, important that we get off to a shaky start.

112
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,000
‎就这样…别钻牛角尖
So that's all... Just don't invest.

113
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,540
‎感受 但别钻牛角尖
Feel, but don't invest.

114
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,080
‎跟着我 相信我
Just go with me. Trust me.

115
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,080
‎不要相信我
Don't trust me.

116
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,580
‎不要相信那个人
Don't trust that person.

117
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,750
‎总之…
Anyway...

118
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,260
‎就这样 对吧 ‎就这样开始
That bit, right? So that's how it's gonna start.

119
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,470
‎观察日常的喜剧
Bit of observational comedy.

120
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,760
‎接下来我呢 ‎就要告诉你一个故事
Then what I'm going to do is I am going to tell you a story

121
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,270
‎关于白天发生在‎狗公园的神秘习题
about a curious incident that took place in the dog park in the daytime.

122
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,940
‎这故事很有趣
Now, it's a fun story. It's a fun story.

123
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,060
‎透过这整个故事 ‎在同意下 我将会接触到
And throughout that story, I will touch on, with consent,

124
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,530
‎这节目最主要的主题 ‎所以你们要特别留意
most of the major themes of the show, so watch out for those.

125
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,650
‎同时也包含不少
And it will also include a fair dose

126
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,740
‎我所谓的温和和蔼的父权芒刺
of what I call a gentle and very good-natured needling of the patriarchy.

127
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,120
‎节目也包含这元素
-So that is in there. -

128
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,450
‎所以非常重要…
So it's very important...

129
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,630
‎要有心理准备很重要 ‎因为节目里绝对有
It's very important that you expect that, because it is there,

130
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,290
‎如果你不喜欢
and if that's not your thing...

131
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,630
‎离开
leave.

132
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,470
‎我已经不断地警告你了 ‎就走吧
I've given you plenty of warning. Just go.

133
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,430
‎走吧 玻璃心 ‎头也不要回地离去
Off you pop, man-flakes. Out you go. Go on with you.

134
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,560
‎在那个故事后 ‎我会再说一则故事
Now, after that story, I'm gonna tell another story.

135
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,850
‎什么 瞧我说的 ‎我知道 经典
What? Look at me go. I know. Classic.

136
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,230
‎第二则故事 ‎是我收到的误诊
The second story is about a misdiagnosis I received,

137
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,230
‎我会把误诊归咎于厌女症
and I'm gonna blame that misdiagnosis squarely on misogyny,

138
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,320
‎因为这是真的
because it's true.

139
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,480
‎现在 再之后…
Now, after...

140
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,740
‎再之后…那只是芒刺
After that... That's just the needle.

141
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,660
‎如果感觉痛的话 ‎趁还能走路 就先离开
If that hurts, get out while you can still walk. Now...

142
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,990
‎故事的最后 我会进行我所谓的“套恶”
at the end of that story, I'm going to do a bit of what I call "hate baiting."

143
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,000
‎我对痛恶我的人设套 ‎这是个非常复杂的概念
It's where I bait my haters. It's a very complex idea.

144
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,920
‎我采取的方式是 ‎我只会说一件事
Now the way that I'll do that is I will just say a thing.

145
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,000
‎我绝对不会搞笑
And I will make no fucking effort to make it funny.

146
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,050
‎我就大辣辣地说出 ‎然后就搁在那儿
I'll just say it and leave it there.

147
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,550
‎我不在乎
I don't care.

148
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,100
‎我强烈建议你不要…
Now, I would strongly recommend that you do not...

149
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,100
‎你不要入套
You do not take the bait.

150
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,060
‎不要对号入座 不是说你
Do not take the bait. It's not for you.

151
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,480
‎对你不好 你会口吐白沫
It's bad for you. You'll be all Frothy McFroth Face.

152
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,900
‎就搁在那边就好
Like, just leave it there.

153
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,360
‎然后呢 我就进入笑话桥段
Then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna move into the joke section,

154
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,190
‎也就是说笑话 对吧
which is jokes, right?

155
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,280
‎所以我才说是笑话桥段 ‎笑话一个接一个
That's why I call it the joke section. It's just joke after joke.

156
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,780
‎真的…很经典
It's really... It's classic.

157
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,280
‎如果在那期间
Now, if in that bit,

158
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,580
‎若你觉得被我所说的冒犯
you find yourself offended by anything I say in the joke section,

159
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,080
请记住都只是笑话
please just remember they are just jokes.

160
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,880
‎就算你发现自己 ‎周遭的人都在哈哈大笑
Even if you find yourself surrounded by people who are laughing

161
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,210
‎那些让你“不苏湖”的话题
at something you find objectionable...

162
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,050
‎只要记住喜剧的黄金准则
just remember the golden rule of comedy, which is,

163
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,590
if you're in a minority, you do not matter.
‎也就是只要你是少数族群 ‎你便举无轻重

164
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,850
‎的确是 别怪我 ‎这准则不是我写的
You don't. Don't blame me. I didn't write the rules of comedy.

165
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,520
‎男人写的 怪他们 ‎我会 挺净化人心的
Men did. Blame them. I do. It's cathartic.

166
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,690
‎现在…
Now...

167
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,060
‎来了 ‎笑话桥段的功用 ‎就是让节目渐入高潮
There we are. The joke section works to really ramp the show up,

168
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,650
‎语调、节奏 ‎加上我对父权的讽刺
in tone, in pace, and also in my needling of the patriarchy.

169
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,780
‎届时 小小的刺激就变成了尖锐的长枪
By that stage, the needle will have become a jousting stick.

170
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,700
‎是的 说是尖锐的长枪
Yep. And then, with said jousting stick,

171
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,990
‎意思就是准备对痛恶我的人‎再开一个屁眼
I'm going to set about tearing my haters a new asshole.

172
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,540
‎是的 又快又准
Yep. Quick as you like.

173
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,790
‎超新的洞
Brand-spanking new.

174
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:26,000
‎我所用的方式 正是痛恶我的人指控我所用的方式
And the way that I'll do that is by doing exactly what my haters accuse me of doing,

175
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,000
‎也就是教训你
which is lecturing you.

176
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,500
‎在节目当中 我将会说教
So in the middle of the show, I'm giving a big, old lecture.

177
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,220
‎曲折 那就好笑了
- -The twist? It's funny.

178
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,510
‎超好笑 对吧
It's fucking funny. Right?

179
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,010
‎也正是痛恶我的人 ‎指控我别当的
Which is exactly what my haters accuse me of not being.

180
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,430
‎让他们不断反覆循环 ‎他们可能会死 愿上帝保佑了
So that's gonna send them on a bit of a loop. May kill them. Fingers crossed.

181
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,020
‎在这个阶段 ‎你也许当下会很纳闷
Now, at this stage, you're probably wondering, and rightly so,

182
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,600
‎我为何要针对痛恶我的人
why would I focus on my haters?

183
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,400
‎我为何要这么做 ‎感觉很纵容自己 是的
Why would I do that? That is self-indulgent. Yes.

184
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,780
‎是的 我拜读过‎泰勒·斯威夫特所有作品
And, yes, I have read all of Taylor Swift's work.

185
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,610
‎我知道我们这年代的圣贤
I am aware of the great sage of our age.

186
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,530
‎我的确明白痛恶我的人 ‎将会不断怀恨下去
I do understand that haters are just gonna hate, hate, hate, hate.

187
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,990
‎痛恶
Hate.

188
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,990
‎不断痛恶
Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.

189
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,960
‎她说得没错 ‎他们会不断重复
And she's not wrong. They are repetitive.

190
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,210
-So why wouldn't I... -
‎所以我为何不…

191
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,040
‎我为何不追随她 然后摆脱掉
Why wouldn't I follow her lead and just shake it off?

192
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,420
‎我为何不这么做
Why wouldn't I do that?

193
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,170
‎就抖掉…
Just shake, shake, shake...

194
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,670
‎这是原因之一
It's one reason. That is one reason.

195
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,970
‎另一个原因是我不相信 ‎我们的朋友小泰泰
The other reason is because I'm not convinced our friend Tay Tay...

196
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,760
‎真的是仇恨犯罪下的受害者
has been a victim of an actual hate crime.

197
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,680
‎而我曾遭遇过
And I have.

198
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:27,600
‎所以自然我们对于网络仇恨处理方式不同
So, naturally, the way that we deal with online hate is going to differ.

199
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,810
‎就我个人 我喜欢当点心吃
Personally, I like to snack on it.

200
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,110
‎是的 吃吃吃 ‎这身材不是凭空而来的
Yep. Nom, nom, nom. This body doesn't just happen.

201
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,820
‎我是大啖仇恨的美女
I am a real hate patootie.

202
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,820
‎在我处理完痛恶我的人后
Now, after I've dealt with my haters there,

203
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,700
‎我会替他们奏管风琴赋格曲
sent them on their little fugue spiral,

204
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,410
‎然后在节目中 ‎我会做个巨大改变
what I'll do then is change gears dramatically in the show,

205
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,460
‎是藉由告诉你们 ‎我患有自闭症的方式
and I will do that by telling you that I have autism.

206
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,960
‎我说出口的方式 ‎就像是揭开一个大秘密
And I'm going to tell you in such a way that it's gonna sound like a big reveal.

207
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,340
‎但其实应该也不惊讶
But it just... it really shouldn't come as a surprise.

208
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,340
‎我刚不就说了 而且…
I've just told you. And...

209
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,350
‎节目到了那个点
And also because everything in the show up until that point

210
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,680
‎其实已经数度警告 ‎我有自闭症了
works as a big sequence of red flags that I have autism.

211
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:10,150
‎老实说 这沿路上都是 ‎我留下的面包屑
Honestly, I have Hansel and Greteled the fuck out of it.

212
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,560
‎都在那里
It is all there.

213
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,360
‎但因为我破坏了我的惊喜
But because I've spoiled my own surprise there,

214
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,570
‎为了再度揭开
in order to make it a big reveal again,

215
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,530
‎我得靠舞台与灯光的效果
I have to rely on staging and lighting tricks

216
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,660
‎让你们觉得 ‎“哇 这是个大秘密”
to bring it in so you go, "Oh, it's a big reveal."

217
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,120
‎所以灯光会照过来 ‎我会站在脚凳上
So the lights are gonna come in, I'm gonna sit on this stool here,

218
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,040
‎然后就象是“现在 当下…”
and it's gonna be, "Right, now..."

219
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,250
‎但没效 因为你们不是笨蛋
And-- And it's not going to work, because you're not fucking idiots.

220
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,960
‎然后再之后…
And then, after that bit,

221
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,300
‎我将会稍稍转到反疫苗运动
I'm gonna do a tiny bit of gear about the anti-vax movement.

222
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,260
‎听听你们自己
Listen to yourselves.

223
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,470
‎听听你们自己
-Listen to yourselves. -

224
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,600
‎这…你并不特别
This is... You're not unusual.

225
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,510
‎是吧 我世界巡回这节目表演
Right, I've toured this show around the world

226
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,390
‎我可以说没有任何地方的‎任何观众
and I can report that no audience anywhere

227
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,850
‎知道在一提到反疫苗运动时
has known how to collectively respond to just the mention...

228
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,400
‎该如何做出集体反应
- -of the anti-vax movement.

229
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,030
‎大概只要说“反疫苗” ‎大家就会说“哈哈 不”
Pretty much, you just say "anti-vax" and people are like, "Ha, ha, no!"

230
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,780
‎这一定会很有趣
So that's gonna be fun.

231
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,910
‎我反疫苗的话题素材‎会跟节目其他的内容风格不同
Now, my anti-vax material is different in tone to the rest of the show.

232
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,120
‎到最后 你可能会觉得
At the end of it, you'll sit there and go, "Ooh.

233
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,250
‎“她真的需要一个抒发的管道”
Well, she just needed to get that off her chest."

234
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,250
- -And it's true, I do. And I will.

235
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,210
‎这是真的 我一定会的

236
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,960
‎但重点是 ‎我从来没碰过
But here's the thing. I've never met a joke...

237
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,300
‎我会想收回的笑话
that I haven't wanted to call back.

238
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,720
‎我从来没碰过
I've never met a joke...

239
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,640
‎各位好
G'day.

240
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,510
‎我从自嘲…
I've never meta...

241
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,520
‎自嘲
Meta joke.

242
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,640
这是双关语
That's a pun.

243
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,520
‎跟上 好吗
Catch up. Right?

244
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,940
‎这是节目充满双关语 ‎会有很多双关语
Now, this is a very pun-heavy show. You need to expect a lot of puns.

245
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,480
‎还会有一个路易CK式笑话
And you also need to expect one Louis C.K. joke.

246
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,070
‎瞧瞧这反应
Listen to that.

247
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,200
‎他就像是个喜剧反疫苗 ‎对吧
He is like the anti-vax of comedy, isn't he?

248
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,160
‎我只有一个笑话 ‎但不是刚才说的
Now, I only have one joke. That wasn't it, by the way.

249
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,250
‎节目还没开始 ‎现在还只是前奏
The show hasn't started. We're still in the prelude.

250
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,790
‎这个笑话…非常棒
The one joke... It's very good.

251
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,960
‎我只需要一个笑话 ‎一个好的笑话
I only need one. It's a good... It's a good joke.

252
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,000
‎那天我休假 不拿笔 ‎吃了饼干 把笑话写出来
It was a day off, pens down, have a biscuit, the day I wrote that joke.

253
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,090
‎超棒的笑话
Fucking good joke.

254
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:02,720
‎我非常确定 我的路易CK笑话 ‎会是让麦克风掉落的经典
I am so solid, my Louis C.K. joke, it's a mic drop moment.

255
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,470
‎我会让让麦克风掉落
And I will drop the mic.

256
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,800
‎不管你们的反应如何 ‎我就会直接丢…
Doesn't matter how you respond, I will drop...

257
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,260
- -the mic.

258
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,260
‎麦克风

259
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,640
‎但我不会真的丢
Except I won't drop the mic,

260
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,430
‎因为你没不知道 ‎但已经有心里准备
because you don't know this yet, but you do,

261
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,150
‎我有自闭症 而且我发现 ‎巨大吵杂声很舒压
I have autism and I find loud noises quite distressing.

262
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,690
‎所以我就会直接 ‎把这鬼东西放在这里
So what I'll do instead is I'll just place the fucker directly on the ground there.

263
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,530
‎就放在这里
-Just pop it down now. -

264
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,410
‎当然这会带走当下的戏剧效果
Now, that will take away from the theatrics of the moment,

265
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,370
‎但先别当个健全主义份子
absolutely, but let's not be ableist about this.

266
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,950
‎路易CK笑话有趣的地方在于
The interesting thing about the Louis C.K. joke

267
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,750
‎是节目很后面的事情
is that it happens very late in the show,

268
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,500
‎后面到你都忘记 ‎你会听到我讲个路易CK的笑话
so late you will have forgotten that I told you to expect a Louis C.K. joke,

269
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,840
‎这表示我在你的欢笑蛋糕上
which means I've just added an extra layer of mirth

270
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,050
‎又加了一层
to your laugh cake.

271
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,930
‎是的 当你在笑的时候 ‎你绝对会 真的很棒
Yep, because when you laugh at it... and you will. It's very good.

272
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,010
‎你在笑的时候
As you're laughing at it,

273
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,470
‎你就会想起我会说个‎路易CK笑话给你听
you will remember that I told you to expect a Louis C.K. joke

274
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,970
‎发现你根本忘记
and realize you'd forgotten.

275
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,680
‎所以你会这样笑
Which means you'll laugh like this. "Ha, ha-- Oh!"

276
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,190
‎也表示我又加了第三层
Which means I've just added a third layer.

277
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:03,440
‎因为你想起来的时候 你会说“这就是她说她会说的笑话”
Because when you realize, you'll go, "That's exactly what she said she'd do!"

278
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,280
‎所以你就会这样笑…“哈哈，欧，嘿”
-So you'll laugh, "Ha, ha-- Oh! Hey!" -laughter]

279
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,700
‎一次两次三次 女人能做到 （歌曲《 ‎一辈子身边的女人》） 是吧
It's once, twice, three times a lady can do that, you see. Hey?

280
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,960
‎当然在对的手里
In the right hands, of course.

281
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,420
‎在对的手里 其实你只需要手
In the right hands. And you only need hands.

282
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,710
‎谁知道 大多女人知道
Who knew? Most women.

283
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,630
‎现在…
Now...

284
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,220
‎反疫苗话题之后…
After the anti-vax material,

285
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,220
‎我将要试图让你进入我的自闭症
what I'm going to do is I'm going to try and let you in on my experience of autism.

286
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,810
‎我的方式是说个我跟可能
And I'll do that by telling a story about, uh, my relationship to a penguin

287
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:36,730
‎在或不在箱子里企鹅之间关系的故事
that may or may not be inside a box.

288
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,690
‎我也不能保证有没有道理
I can't promise you it'll make more sense then either.

289
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,190
‎然后我再说教 做节目的结尾
And then I'll finish the show out with another lecture.

290
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,030
‎什么 还讲道理 谁知道
What? Another lecture? Who knew?

291
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,950
‎我知道 你现在知道了 ‎所以才在现在说明
I did. Now you do. That is what is going on here.

292
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,580
‎我承认节目的最后
Now, I will admit, the-- the last part of the show there,

293
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,000
‎我将会比节目一开始更讨喜一些
I will be much more likable than I am in the beginning.

294
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,500
‎几近可爱边缘
Borderline adorable.

295
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,170
‎你可能在想
Now, you're probably wondering

296
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,750
‎我为何不全力以赴
why wouldn't I start with my best foot forward,

297
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,000
‎发射可爱子弹 ‎我为何不这么做
adorable guns a-blazing? Why wouldn't I do that?

298
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,720
‎为何一开始要让人不喜欢
Why would I start off being a bit unlikable?

299
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,550
‎因为这是个自闭症的节目
Because this is a show about autism.

300
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,310
‎自闭症的人总是 ‎让人第一印象深刻
And people with autism rarely make a good first impression.

301
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:18,310
‎大部分的人因此对我们退避三舍
And most people tend to write us off because of that.

302
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:22,060
‎这是反馈给坚持不懈之人的节目
So this is a show that rewards people who persevere.

303
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:26,110
‎那些愿意穿越柳暗而看见花明的人
Who go beyond their discomfort just to see what's on the other side of the spectrum.

304
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:29,860
‎对于那些人而言 ‎这节目绝对就是浪漫喜剧了
For those people, this show does work like a romantic comedy.

305
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,320
‎理论上来说是的 ‎因为理论最迷人
Theoretically, 'cause theories are sexy.

306
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,700
‎节目就这样
Now, that's it. That's the show.

307
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,410
‎这就是你所期待能看见的一切 ‎期待已经设定完毕
That's everything you can expect. Expectations have been set.

308
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,920
‎现在就上台一鞠躬
So the show starts now.

309
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,500


310
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,130
‎你有没有注意到过…
Have you ever noticed...

311
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,920


312
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,560
‎美国人是如何…
how Americans...

313
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,060


314
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,440
‎变得没那么笨
are not stupid?

315
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,850
‎这有问题吗
What's up with that?

316
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,360
‎你们不笨
You're not stupid.

317
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,030
‎我发现这点时超失望
I was so disappointed to discover that.

318
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:10,860
‎因为我被你们误导
Because I had been led to believe, by you...

319
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,330
‎你们蠢到爆
that you are as dumb as bricks.

320
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,870
‎然后见到你们大家 ‎根本不是这样
And then I meet you all, and then you're not.

321
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,630
‎当然还是有配额 ‎我们都有 但你们不…
I mean, you've got your quota, as have we all, but you're not...

322
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,750
‎你知道你们如何 ‎在人文上非常有自信
Do you know what you are? You're culturally confident.

323
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,840
‎你们非常不错
Good on you, I say. Good on you.

324
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,840
And you know who else had that skill set?
‎真的不错 你们知道 ‎谁还有这种本领

325
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,930
‎古罗马人
The ancient Romans.

326
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,680
‎他们曾经一度辉煌
And things worked out well for them... for a bit.

327
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,640
‎别钻牛角尖 没事的
Don't invest. It's all right.

328
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,180
‎撑住 没事 美国 加油
Hold true. You're all right. You're all right, America. Hang in there.

329
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,850
Invest a little.

330
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,810
‎可以钻一点点了

331
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,900
‎我认为是你们的自信 ‎让你们愚蠢
Now, I think it's your confidence that makes you stupid.

332
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,150
‎先缓缓 别钻牛角尖
Bear with me. Don't invest.

333
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,530
‎老实说 我真的觉得 ‎因为自信…
Honestly, I do, because confidence...

334
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:52,110
‎自信让人愚蠢 ‎这点我非常有自信
Confidence makes you stupid, and I'm very confident in that opinion.

335
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,370
‎因为你们对于美国这身份 ‎非常的有自信
Because you're so confident in your American-inity

336
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:00,200
‎让你自恃一切 ‎因为是美国 一定是对的 是吧
that you hang onto things just 'cause it's American and it must be right, right?

337
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,410
‎你的自恃就是因为是美国
You hang onto things just 'cause it's American,

338
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,790
‎你所自恃的证明非常愚蠢
even if the thing you cling to is proof of literal stupidity.

339
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,210
‎我说个例子 一个就够了
And I'll give you an example. I only need one.

340
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,260
‎我们加油…
Now, we fossil fuel...

341
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,260
‎我们在澳洲给汽车加油 ‎跟你们加的油一样 对吧
We fossil fuel our cars with the same stuff you do, in Australia, right?

342
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,960
‎我们用的是“石油“
We fossil fuel it with petroleum.

343
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,640
‎因为石油挺难念的
Now, "petroleum" is very heavy of the syllable.

344
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,680
‎我们没时间 超忙的 ‎没时间念这么难的字
We don't have time. We're busy people. We don't have time for syllables.

345
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,480
‎哈哈哈 这就是我们擅长的
"LOL." You know, this is where we're at.

346
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,810
‎我们很聪明地把“石油” ‎变得好念 对吧
So we've wisely shortened "petroleum" here and there, right?

347
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,570
‎在澳洲 我们把“石油”简称做“汽油”
In Australia, we've shortened "petroleum" to "petrol."

348
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,450
‎我不是在自夸 这不是… ‎我们只是不讲了
Now, I'm not bragging. That's not... Like, we've just stopped talking.

349
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,120
‎就这样自然演变 我们就说“汽油”
That is all that has happened there. We're just like, "Petrol."

350
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,870
‎你们倒是更深一步发挥想象力
You have dug a lot deeper into the hat of imagination

351
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,710
‎来简称“石油”
for your shortening of "petroleum,"

352
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,330
‎因为你们称做“瓦斯”
because you've shortened it to "gas."

353
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:51,420
‎石油有意思的是它是液体
Now, the interesting thing about petroleum is that it is a liquid.

354
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:00,180
‎而瓦斯就它天杀的定义上而言 ‎非常有意思的是…
And the interesting thing about gas, by its very fucking definition...

355
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,390
‎它根本不是液体
- -is that it is not a liquid!

356
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,150
‎但你们比较喜欢煤气化科学 ‎还是随便了
But you guys would rather gaslight science, or flood it.

357
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,940
‎我根本不懂你们脑袋里在想什么
I don't know how the thinking happens in your head!

358
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,570
But you will not change,

359
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,610
‎但你们不会改变

360
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,690
‎因为你们会说“这是对的 ‎我们想过而且我们是美国人”
'cause you're like, "It's right, 'cause we thought of it and we're Americans."

361
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,610
‎但这不对 超蠢
But it's not right. It is dumb in the face!

362
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:23,700
‎我开始在这里巡回时 有人‎跟我说要把词汇改得美国一点
When I first started touring here, I was told I should Americanize my language.

363
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,080
‎而我的回答是
To which I responded,

364
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,790
‎“去你的 美国化这字的结尾不是Z 混帐”
"Fuck off. Americanise is not spelled with a 'Z,' fuckers."

365
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,130
‎老实说 美国就象是个白异男文化
Honestly, Americans are like the straight, white man of cultures.

366
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,510
‎你们说“口以” ‎就只在乎这点而已
You say, "To-may-to," that's all you care about.

367
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:42,010
‎见鬼了 我才不会 ‎屈服在你们的自信下
Like, fuck off. I will not bow to your confidence.

368
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,770
‎我不会说“汗衫”
I will not say, "Sweater."

369
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:49,190
‎我会说“套头衫” ‎你们自己调适
I will be saying, "Jumper," and you can cope.

370
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,990
‎我不是说“套头衫”比较对 ‎而是“套头衫”本来就对
I'm not suggesting that "jumper" makes sense. "Jumper" makes fuck all sense.

371
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,700
‎但这样改听起来很好玩
But what it does do is it sounds fun.

372
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,820
‎“我要穿套头衫”
"I'm gonna put on a jumper."

373
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,240
‎“好的 祝你愉快 闪边去”
"Oh, mate, you're gonna have a good day. Off you pop."

374
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,700
‎但你们穿汗衫
But you guys, you put on a sweater.

375
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,340
‎“是的 我身上上半身的衣服 ‎是用来吸我身体的汗”
"Yeah, this is the top I wear to soak up the wet of my body. Mmm."

376
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,130
‎饼干
Biscuit.

377
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,760
‎饼干
Biscuit.

378
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,180
‎是吧
Deal with it.

379
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:25,520
‎我节目后面叫某个人 ‎混帐饼干（短肥屌） 而我这么说…
I call someone a dick biscuit later in the show, and when I say...

380
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,600
‎因为我是大人了
'Cause I'm mature.

381
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,140
‎当…
And when...

382
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:32,060
‎我说“饼干” ‎你们所谓的“曲奇饼”
I say, "Biscuit," I mean what you call a cookie.

383
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,280
‎而不是你们所谓的小面包 ‎那个我叫做粗司康
And not what you call a biscuit, which is what I call a rogue scone.

384
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,780
-That is a scone what forgot its manners. -

385
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,490
‎那个是忘记规矩的司康

386
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,320
‎完全失控
It is out of control.

387
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,870
‎但我不会说“混帐曲奇饼”
But I will not say, "Dick cookie."

388
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,580
‎我绝对不会 ‎我拒绝 因为辞不达意
I will not. I refuse, 'cause it doesn't work.

389
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,380
‎当你叫混帐饼干时 ‎表示我们不喜欢他们
When you call someone a dick biscuit, it means we don't want to like them.

390
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,710
‎而“混帐饼干”就有这个含意
And "dick biscuit" does that.

391
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,500
‎听起来他们就在史莱哲林
It sounds like they're in Slytherin.

392
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,340
‎混帐饼干
- -Dick Biscuit.

393
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,760
‎混帐曲奇饼
Dick cookie? Yeah, it's all right.

394
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,220
‎雷文克劳
It's like Ravenclaw.

395
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,680
‎虽然搞不清楚他们在干嘛 ‎但他们好像还好 还可以
No one really knows what's up with them, but they seem all right. They seem fine.

396
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,100
‎如果我说考克毕斯卡提 ‎（义式坚果饼干）医师…
And I've decided that Dr. Cock Biscotti...

397
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:12,690
Hufflepuff.

398
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:12,650
‎赫夫帕夫

399
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,400
‎绝对是赫夫帕夫
That is definitely Hufflepuff.

400
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,440
Dr. Cock Biscotti.

401
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,480
‎考克毕斯卡提医师

402
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,950
‎我根本不考虑葛来分多 ‎去他们的
And I've put no thought into Gryffindor whatsoever, 'cause fuck 'em.

403
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,700
‎他们都象是霍格华兹李的白异男
They are like the straight, white man of Hogwarts.

404
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,370
"What about Hermione?" She's probably a terf. Fuck her.

405
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,330
‎“那妙丽呢 ” ‎她可能是个排跨基女 去她的

406
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,460
‎一记重击
Punching up.

407
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,630
‎我也做了些让步 ‎我不是蛮横不讲理
I mean, I have made some concessions for you. I'm not a monster.

408
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,470
‎我会说“沃里” ‎《沃里在哪里 》
Like, I'll say, "Waldo." Where's Waldo?

409
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,510
‎我其实知道他叫威利 ‎看吧 没这么难
I've always known him as Wally, but, look, it's not that hard.

410
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,760
‎“沃里” 就得了
"Waldo." Did it.

411
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,640
‎关键就在这里 找到沃里 ‎就能找到威利
So the trick is there. If you find Waldo, you've found Wally.

412
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,730
‎他们两个是同一人
-It's the same guy. -

413
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:55,190
‎我很乐意接受你们的赘词
And I've happily taken on a lot of your wordage.

414
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,650
‎你们的语言里很多 ‎美国 我喜欢
There's a lot about your language I like, America.

415
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,860
像是“芝麻叶”
Like "arugula."

416
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,940
Yes, please.

417
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,900
‎是的 来一份

418
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,400
‎我们称之为“火箭”
We call that stuff "rocket."

419
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,530
‎火箭滚开 我要芝麻叶 ‎听起来象是小丑车喇叭
Fuck off, rocket. I want arugula. It sounds like a clown car horn.

420
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,080
‎是的 麻烦 芝麻叶
Yes, please. Arugula!

421
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,460
‎还有铝
And aluminum. Mm-hmm. Yes.

422
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,340
‎是的 我们的拼法一样 ‎但念法不同
We have the same word, but we say, "Alu-min-ium."

423
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,050
‎可以带点情趣的语调念时 ‎为何要这么说
Why would you say, "Aluminium," when you can flirt it?

424
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,970
"Al-u-minum."

425
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,970
‎铝

426
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,510
‎“别闹了 美国”
"Stop it, America."

427
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,100
‎还有“你们大伙” 是的 拜托
And, "Y'all?" Oh, yes, please!

428
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,100
‎“感谢你们大伙
"Thanks all y'all for y'all.

429
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,730
‎我带你们大伙 我爱你们大伙”
I'm taking y'all. I love y'all."

430
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,230
‎因为“你们大伙”是最棒、最包含
Because "y'all" is the best, most inclusive

431
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,200
‎第二人称复数的英语系的字
second-person, plural pronoun in the English-speaking world.

432
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:50,040
‎感谢 南方 好盟军
Thank you, the South. What an ally.

433
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,870
‎对于“小妹妹”我就不确定了
I'm in two minds about "fanny."

434
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,500
‎单纯这个字
Just the word.

435
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,090
‎这里“小妹妹”指的是屁股后面、臀部、屁屁
'Cause, here, "fanny" is your butt. Your rear end, your backside, your bum.

436
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:05,510
‎在澳洲 “小妹妹”则是 ‎专门指的是女孩子那里
In Australia, "fanny" refers specifically to the lady front bum,

437
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,590
‎这是广义的说法
to use inclusive language. I don't know.

438
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:14,600
‎当我第一次在美国听见‎大家都有“小妹妹” 我觉得挺酷的
And when I first heard that everyone in America has a fanny, I thought, "Cool.

439
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,980
‎非常酷
Cool, cool, cool.

440
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,110
‎我象是到了勒斯博岛 ‎来去吧
I'm going to the Isle of Lesbos. Giddy up."

441
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,490
‎只是个玩笑 不该出现
That's just a joke. It doesn't belong there.

442
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:27,410
‎肯定是从玩笑桥段跑出来 ‎我道歉
Must have snuck out of the joke section. Apologies there.

443
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,660
‎不 我很久以前就知道 ‎“小妹妹”的差异性了
No, I've known about the fanny discrepancy for a very long time.

444
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,040
‎我从没忘记我发现
I will never forget the day

445
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,290
‎“小妹妹”在这里意思 ‎不同于家乡的那天
I discovered "fanny" meant a different thing here than it does back home.

446
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:40,250
‎当时我在学校 看一本书 ‎是一本没翻译的美国书
I was at school, I was reading a book. It was an American book. Untranslated.

447
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,380
‎我向来还蛮有语言天赋的
I've always had a bit of a gift for the languages.

448
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,510
‎只是一本四个小孩的探险故事
Now, it was just a random children's book about four kids on an adventure

449
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,760
‎而探险里…
and part of their adventure...

450
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,350
‎显然这四个小孩滑下山丘
Apparently these four children slid down a hill.

451
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,480
‎靠屁股（小妹妹）滑下去
On their fannies.

452
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,900
‎我一整个下午恍神
And I lost an afternoon.

453
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,450
‎我恍神了一个下午 ‎想把这件事搞懂
I lost an afternoon trying to make that work in my mind's eye,

454
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:10,280
‎因为滑下坡根本不是这种方法啊
because that is not how you go down a hill!

455
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:15,250
‎如果你这样滑下去 ‎绝对自愿 肯定是跌倒
If you go down a hill like that, that is not a decision. You've tripped.

456
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:20,210
‎而四个小孩同时跌倒的机率 ‎是有多高…
And what are the chances of four children synchronized-tripping...

457
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,210
‎而且作者还觉得稀松平常
and it not rating a mention from the narrator?

458
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,500
‎怎么可能
Fuck all.

459
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,840
‎所以为何要选择这样下去
So why would you choose to go down like that?

460
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,970
‎不符合空气力学
It's not aerodynamic,

461
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,930
‎我不在乎你怎么觉得 ‎那里可很脆弱
and I don't care how you identify, that is vulnerable.

462
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,680
‎你怎么开始下去 ‎是头先下去 还是脚
And which way do you go? Head first? Feet first?

463
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,430
‎都不符合空气力学 那膝盖勒
Well, neither are aerodynamic.

464
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,270
‎那膝盖勒
And what the fuck do you do with your knees?

465
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,030
‎我可能该告诉你 ‎“道格拉斯”是什么意思
I should probably tell you what "Douglas" means.

466
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,080
‎因为这里的意思 ‎跟我家乡的意思简直天壤之别
'Cause it means a very different thing here than it does back home.

467
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:59,080
‎在澳洲 道格拉斯是 ‎袋鼠子宫的俚语
In Australia, a Douglas is slang for a kangaroo's uterus.

468
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,380
‎才不是
It's fucking not.

469
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:06,050
‎我们为何有这种俚语
Like, why would we have slang for that?

470
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,340
‎搞什么飞机
For fuck's sake.

471
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,340
‎澳洲人根本没这么道地 拜托
Australians are not even that Australian. Come on.

472
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,470
‎那只是我狗的名字
It was just my dog's name.

473
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,350
‎我以我的狗命名这节目
I've named this show after my dog.

474
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,310
‎他叫道格拉斯
His name's Douglas.

475
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,730
‎你们鼓掌还蛮奇怪 但挺酷的
It's weird that that's the thing you clap, but cool.

476
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,320
‎“非常好 你替你的狗取名字 ‎再取同样的节目名称
"Well done, you named your dog and then your show after the same...

477
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,990
You're not so weird anymore."

478
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:31,990
‎你其实也没这么奇怪”

479
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,450
‎道格拉斯是我第一只狗
Douglas is my first dog. Douglas is my first dog.

480
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,160
‎现在长大了 在成长过程中 ‎我养过很多狗
As an adult. I had lots of dogs when I was growing up.

481
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,960
‎我家人也养过几只 ‎我们住在繁忙的街道上
Our family went through them a bit. We lived on a busy road.

482
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,590
‎好 你们了解这情况
All right. That's where you're at.

483
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,090
听着 只是…
-Look, it just... -

484
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,880
really paints a picture of a time and a place. Look... [chuckles]
‎真的具体描绘出时间地点

485
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,220
‎道格拉斯很好 ‎我不再住在繁忙的街道上了
Douglas is fine. I don't live on a busy road anymore.

486
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,760
‎我把它照顾得很好
I take good care of the boy.

487
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,300
‎我带它到狗公园去
I take him to the dog park.

488
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,970
‎固定去狗公园的人
And anyone who goes to a dog park on the regular

489
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,770
‎都知道其实在狗公园
knows that no good conversation is ever had...

490
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,270
‎并没有什么有趣话题
- -at a dog park.

491
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,650
‎那里只是八卦之处
They are just festivals of small talk,

492
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:09,360
‎那里不是我天生的生长地
and that is not my natural habitat.

493
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,320
‎你还不知道原因 ‎但会知道的
You don't know why yet, but you do.

494
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,950
‎现在我来说个故事
Now, I want to tell you a story

495
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,790
‎就说有一次我在狗公园 ‎一场相当糟糕的对话
about a terrible conversation I had at the dog park once.

496
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,290
‎有个家伙朝我走来
This bloke just walks up to me.

497
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:27,590
‎他带了只狗 不是什么怪咖 ‎跟地点相关的人士
I mean, he had a dog. He wasn't just being creepy. He had context.

498
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,130
‎我要告诉你
I want to tell you this.

499
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:31,470
‎这跟故事无关 ‎但我只是要你明白
It's not pertinent to the story, but I want you to know.

500
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,260
‎他的狗穿鞋
His dog had shoes on.

501
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,100
‎但他的狗不想穿鞋
And his dog did not want to have shoes on.

502
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,640
‎因为牠一直这样…
He was doing that, like...

503
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,890
‎它是只小灵狗 ‎大部分时间都在颤抖
And it was a whippet situation, and they're shaky at the best of times.

504
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,100
‎我们不知道原因 是冷吗 ‎还是紧张 不知道
We don't know why. Are they cold? Are they nervous?

505
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,060
‎但牠就…一直这样
But it was like just... It was a lot.

506
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,980
‎对我的故事不重要 ‎但一直在我的周边
Now, it's not important to the story, but it was a lot in my periphery,

507
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,490
‎这点也让你明白
so I just want you to know.

508
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,280
‎附加压力
Added stress.

509
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,200
‎这是我朋友的破冰工具
Now, this was my, uh, friend's icebreaker.

510
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,540
‎我们从没见过 这是他的破冰方式 ‎他说 “你知道…
We'd never met. This was his icebreaker. He said, "Did you know...

511
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:06,330
it takes less muscles to smile than frown?"
‎笑比皱眉头用到的肌肉要少 ”

512
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,630
‎坐在观众席的男人大概觉得
The men in the audience are sitting there going,

513
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,170
‎“你遇到的只是个别事件”
"Oh, you've experienced an isolated incident."

514
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:20,430
‎坐在观众席的女人一定觉得 ‎“拜托 搞什么鬼”
And the women are sitting there going, "Oh, for fuck's sake."

515
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:25,140
‎而非二元性别的人会觉得 ‎“妳那天不顺吧 是吧 ”
And non-binary folk are like, "Is that a hard day for you? Is it?"

516
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,190
‎就破冰的话题来说 ‎这真是差劲透顶了
Now, as far as icebreakers go, it's a fucking shit one.

517
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:34,740
‎基本上他的意思是 ‎“你的脸不对 能换一张吗 ”
Basically what he's saying is, "Your face is wrong. Can you change it?"

518
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,660
‎真的 ‎就算我对他合理怀疑 是吧
Like, honestly. And even if I gave him the benefit of the doubt, right,

519
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:43,250
‎真的相信消耗能量是他的主要考量
and truly believed that energy consumption was his chief concern...

520
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:46,870
‎他看着我心想“她最好知道
That he was just looking at me, going, "If only she knew.

521
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,170
She could live her best life.

522
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,170
‎她就该享福了

523
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,840
‎要是她知道 她就能从日常获得更多”
She could get so much more out of her day if only she knew."

524
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,090
Like, even if I believed that,

525
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,550
‎就算我相信 问题是 ‎我既没笑也没有皱眉

526
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,590
the thing is, I was neither smiling nor frowning.

527
00:25:56,050 --> 00:26:00,760
My face was neutral, which takes fuck all muscles.

528
00:25:56,050 --> 00:26:00,800
‎我的脸毫无表情 ‎根本没用到肌肉

529
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,060
‎现在我大概明白我毫无表情时 ‎可能不太令人愉快
Now, I am aware that my neutral face is not particularly chipper.

530
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,650
‎我的确看起来像有个人 ‎反拿汤匙插进马铃薯里
Like, I do look like someone stabbed a potato with a spoon upside down.

531
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:10,610
Honestly, like...

532
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,610
‎真的

533
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:14,900
No muscles.

534
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,900
‎完全没用到肌肉

535
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,070
‎毫无表情
Neutral.

536
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,570
我就是一张臭脸 ‎如此而已
Now, I have resting bitch face. That's what it's called.

537
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,950
‎也就是大家所谓的婊子脸
That's what it's colloquially known as. Resting bitch face.

538
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,080
‎只有女人才有婊子脸
Only women have resting bitch face.

539
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,000
‎男人就脑袋思考着重要事情 ‎最好别打岔
Men simply have very important thoughts you'd best not interrupt them having.

540
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,630
‎真的 没人走到一个陌生男人面前
Honestly, no one has ever gone up to a man while he's a stranger and gone,

541
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:35,170
"Cheer up, love. It may never happen." No!
‎然后说“开心点 亲爱的 ‎可能根本不会发生” 从来没有

542
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,930
‎就破冰话题而言 这挺差劲的
As far as icebreakers go, that was a bit shit.

543
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,640
‎你知道我怎么回答
Do you know how I responded?

544
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,300
‎我开始皱眉
I started frowning.

545
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,810
‎我开始使用我之前
I started using muscles

546
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:46,730
根本不想使用的肌肉
I'd had no intention of using just moments earlier.

547
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:51,810
‎但他觉得好像非常顺利 ‎于是他又更向前迈进
But he thought it went very well, so he stepped the conversation up another notch,

548
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,820
‎他说“你的狗叫什么名字 ”经典
and he said, "What is your dog's name?" Classic.

549
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,280
And I responded by saying, "Doug."
我回答“道格”

550
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,200
‎因为我发现只有它惹麻烦时 ‎才会是道格拉斯
'Cause he's only Douglas when he's in trouble, I discovered.

551
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,620
‎当我说“道格”时 ‎这家伙有点反应过渡
Now, when I said, "Doug," this man's response was a little much.

552
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,870
‎他基本上… ‎在我说“道格”时 他就这样…
He's basically... I said, "Doug," and he's gone...

553
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,370
"Good one."
‎“好名字”

554
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,540
‎然后我说…
And I said...

555
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,000
"It's not."

556
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:14,960
‎“并不是”

557
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:20,220
I don't know why. I think I was still in Frown Land.

558
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:20,260
‎我不知道原因 ‎大概我还是眉头深锁

559
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,180
I've just gone, "It's not a good name."

560
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,180
‎我就说“并不是个好名字”

561
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,180
And he said, "It is."

562
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,180
‎然后他说“是好名字”

563
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,730
‎所以我说“不是”
So I said, "It's not."

564
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,100
‎这简直…这事真的发生了
So let's just... This is what's happening.

565
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,610
‎我在狗公园跟个陌生人吵
I'm having an argument with a stranger in the dog park

566
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,690
‎我狗的名字好不好
about whether or not my dog's name is good,

567
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,530
‎我并没有站在你假设的那一方
and I'm not on the side you'd assume I'd be on.

568
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,320
And his dog had shoes on.

569
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,320
‎而且他的狗穿鞋子

570
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,990
‎我们有更重要的事要谈
We had more important things to talk about.

571
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,540
Instead, we're going, "It's a bad name." "It's a good name."

572
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,500
‎结果我们却在那边说 ‎“坏名字” “好名字”

573
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,040
‎最后 他就说“听着

574
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,080
Eventually, he's like, "Look.

575
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,880
It's a good name, because Doug...

576
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,830
‎是个好名字 因为道格…

577
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:55,380
Dogs dig.

578
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,380
‎是狗 挖洞

579
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,880
‎道格（挖洞）”
Doug."

580
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,640
‎身为专业的喜剧演员 ‎当下我深感受辱
Now it was a singularly humiliating moment as a professional comedian

581
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,470
‎我自己的笑话 居然没想到
to have my own joke, that I hadn't even thought of,

582
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,720
‎结果还让别人解释
explained back to me.

583
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,770
‎好像我想过 只是忘记而已
As if I had thought of it, but just forgot.

584
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:12,940
‎像是我根本没注意到
Like, I didn't notice.

585
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,270
‎我养了道格超过一年
I'd had Doug for over a year.

586
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,900
都没想到牠的名字是个双关语
Hadn't fucking clocked that his name was a pun.

587
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,320
‎真丢脸
Humiliated.

588
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,110
‎所以我做了任何成年人会做的事 我撒谎
So I did what any reasonable, mature person would do. I lied.

589
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,320
I said, "No.
‎ 我说“不

590
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,490
‎它叫道格拉斯
I've-- His name's Douglas.

591
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:30,330
‎我以道格拉斯凹陷来替它命名
And I named him after the Pouch of Douglas,

592
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,580
‎我让你明白”
I will have you know."

593
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,210
‎他问“什么是道格拉斯凹陷 ”
And he said, "What is the Pouch of Douglas?"

594
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,290
‎这倒是问得很公平
And it's a fair question,

595
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,670
‎因为道格拉斯凹陷是个难解的情况
because the Pouch of Douglas is an obscure situation.

596
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,130
‎于是我解释了
So I explained.

597
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:44,090
‎我说“道格拉斯凹陷 ‎算是存在的潜在空间存在于
I said, "The Pouch of Douglas is a bit of potential space that exists,

598
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,720
and it's situated between the anal cavity...
‎女性肛门腔与…

599
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:52,890
‎子宫之间 女性生理的生育环境”
and the uterus in the female, biological sex reproductive environment."

600
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,190
‎在狗公园勒
At the dog park!

601
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,980
‎这家伙眼眨都不眨
And this guy did not blink.

602
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,360
‎他僵在那里
He's just frozen.

603
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,400
然后开始皱眉
And he started frowning.

604
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:07,450
‎他突然非常地努力
And... he was suddenly working very hard.

605
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:11,830
‎我接收到他那恐惧带着点排斥的表情
And I took that look of fear mingled with vague repulsion

606
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:15,040
and mistook it for genuine curiosity.

607
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:15,080
‎并且误以为是单纯好奇

608
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,630
And I thought, "This man wants to know more."

609
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,630
‎我想“这家伙求知欲挺强的”

610
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,670
‎于是我又解释 ‎“不在前面 也不在后面
So I explained, "It's neither front, nor back.

611
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,470
‎就在正中间
It's right in the middle.

612
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,260
‎在女性生殖器中立地区 ‎
It's in fanny neutral territory.

613
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,300
我们称之为阴部瑞士
We'll call it fanny Switzerland.

614
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,720
‎而且没有自己的入口” ‎我说的以为这样更清楚
And it doesn't have its own entrance," I said, as if that made it all better.

615
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:35,140
‎“像是 你不能… ‎根本到不了
"Like, you can't...  You can't just get to it.

616
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,440
Although, if you were to stick your thumb up the bum

617
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,440
‎虽然如果你把拇指塞进你的屁股

618
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,650
‎用手指把阴道撑高
and your finger up the relevant vagine...

619
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,070
and clap...

620
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,030
‎然后抠一下

621
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,360
‎差不多就在那里
that bit in there...

622
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,910
‎那就是你的道格拉斯凹陷处 ‎在那里面”
that's your Pouch of Douglas. In there."

623
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,700
‎在狗公园里勒
At the dog park!

624
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,630
'Cause it's not an actual thing. It's just...

625
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,580
‎因为这真的不是这样

626
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:01,000
It's a crawl space for emergencies. The best...
‎这是紧急逃生空间 ‎我最多…

627
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,340
‎我最多能这样解释
The best way I can explain it is this.

628
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,670
‎像是你有个行李箱而且想要打开来
You've got a suitcase and you want to open the suitcase.

629
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,010
‎你拉起拉链 沿着行李箱拉一圈
You take the zip all the way around the suitcase,

630
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:11,260
‎但当你要打开行李箱时却开不了
but when you go to open the suitcase, it does not open,

631
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,260
‎因为你没有拉真的拉链
because you have not used the zip zip.

632
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,190
‎而是拉到周围一圈的扩增拉链
You've used the funny zip, which does go all the way around the suitcase,

633
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,350
‎但打不开行李箱 骗了你
but it doesn't fucking open. It just mocks you.

634
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,860
So when you go to open the suitcase, it just does that...

635
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,860
‎所以当你打开行李箱 ‎就这样…

636
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,820
‎而你还没打开行李箱
And now, you have not opened the suitcase.

637
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,530
‎但你让里面的空间变大了
But what you've done is you've created a bit of extra space in there,

638
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:31,830
‎但你看不见 也摸不到
and you can't see it, and you can't access it.

639
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,160
‎但你知道存在在里面
But you know it's there.

640
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,250
‎那就是道格拉斯凹陷
That is the Pouch of Douglas.

641
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,250
‎非常感谢 我很开心
Thank you. I'm delighted.

642
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:45,340
‎我很开心你们喜欢 ‎我解释道格拉斯凹陷的方式
I'm delighted you enjoyed my explanation of the Pouch of Douglas,

643
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,880
‎因为我那位狗公园的朋友不爱
because my friend at the dog park did not.

644
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:54,010
‎我仍旧无法释怀 ‎因为我体内有东西
I just still can't get over that there's something inside of me,

645
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,060
‎尤其在我身体里那特别的部位
in a very particular part of my body...

646
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,480
‎叫做道格拉斯凹陷
called the Pouch of Douglas.

647
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,980
‎超奇怪 也不算好
It's fucking weird, borderline not okay.

648
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,690
‎但也提醒我们生活在一个
But it is also a reminder that we do live in a world

649
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,320
‎一切由男人命名的世界里
where everything has been named by men.

650
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,570
‎所有一切
Everything.

651
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,320
‎一切的一切
Everything.

652
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:14,660
‎那是以一位男性医师 ‎詹姆斯道格拉斯而命名
And that was named after a man. Dr. James Douglas,

653
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,790
‎他是一位十八世纪的苏格兰助产男士
who was an 18th century Scottish man midwife.

654
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,500
‎真是个令人很不“苏湖”的人口统计
What an uncomfortable collection of demographics that is.

655
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,250
‎别把你领英档案的标题写成这个
Like, do not headline your LinkedIn with that.

656
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,630
这是个错误
That is a mistake.

657
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:30,510
It was named after Dr. James Douglas, because apparently he found it first.

658
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:30,510
‎以詹姆斯道格拉斯医师来命名 ‎显然是他最先发现的

659
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,140
‎那天真精彩 ‎他那天应该过得很精彩
What a day. What a day he must have been having.

660
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,100
‎对个女尸临检
Just rummaging around a lady cadaver.

661
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,020
‎检查检查 当时的嗜好不同
Rummage, rummage. Hobbies were different then.

662
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,890
‎他肯定找到增大拉链
He must have just found her funny zip,

663
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,270
‎然后看到它存在那里 ‎一个空间 没有名字
and then saw it sitting there, all void, no name.

664
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:46,520
‎当下詹姆斯道格拉斯医师 ‎肯定想到“这就是了
At which point, Dr. James Douglas must have thought, "Well, this is it.

665
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:49,610
‎这是我成为传奇的机会”
- -This is my shot at legacy."

666
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,530
‎老实说 这老是让我惊异不已
Honestly, it just never ceases to amaze me

667
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,740
‎小家伙要怎么做 ‎才能留名青史
how little men have to do in order to be remembered.

668
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,620
‎他发现了个“没什么” ‎然后宣称是他的
He found a "not thing" and called dibs.

669
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,170
‎要是女人参与命名的话
We would live in a very different world

670
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,050
‎我们的世界将会非常不一样
if women had participated in the naming of things.

671
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,010
Like, do you fellows honestly believe you'd have balls

672
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:11,010
‎你们各位真的相信 ‎如果让女人参与那场会议

673
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,800
‎你们会有球球吗
if women had been at that meeting?

674
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,890
‎才不会 因为是这样的
No. 'Cause here's the thing.

675
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:19,140
‎女人不会把你们的睪丸 ‎当成运动或是比赛
Women don't think of your testicles as a sport or a game.

676
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,640
‎你们喜欢玩 ‎这完全跟我们无关
You like to play with them. That is your bag and your bag alone.

677
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,730
-Cool story. -

678
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,100
‎这故事很酷吧

679
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:28,270
‎但如果我们叫做 ‎“凯伦双手握不住” 你们觉得呢
But how would you like it if we'd have given you "Karen's handful?"

680
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,660
‎你们究竟喜欢不喜欢
How the fuck would you like that?

681
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:37,990
‎让个老女人整天抓着你的腰内肉
Just having an olde woman with a grip around your tenderloins all fucking day.

682
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,290
‎你们会喜欢吗
How would you like that?

683
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,500
‎抱歉 我显然不是专家 ‎这怎么回事
I'm so sorry. I'm clearly not an expert. What is this?

684
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,460
‎非常抱歉
- -I am sorry.

685
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:50,130
‎在我想象里面 ‎凯伦是个牵线木偶
I think, in my mind's eye, Karen is a marionette. Just...

686
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,340
‎“这球球… ”
"What do balls...?"

687
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,340
‎我得去看医生
I had to see a doctor...

688
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,590
‎好久以前的事了
Uh, this is a while ago.

689
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,180
‎因为我的道格拉斯环境 ‎出了点问题
Um... 'Cause I had some issues with my Douglas environment,

690
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,140
‎非常广义的说来
very broadly speaking.

691
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,560
‎我的家医不在 我得看她的代班
And my regular doctor was away, so I was seeing her replacement.

692
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,060
‎那位代班医师
Uh, now, the replacement doctor

693
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,520
要是让我选 ‎我绝对不会选
was not a doctor I would ever have chosen for myself.

694
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:11,150
‎我们不太对盘 一开始就不太好
We weren't a good match. We didn't get along from the get-go.

695
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,570
‎他是目中无人的混球
He was a fucking arrogant asshole.

696
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:16,740
‎当然他绝对也是位合格的医师
I mean, he was a qualified doctor as well. Yes, absolutely.

697
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:19,330
‎那是张有很多交叉的维恩图
But that is a Venn diagram with a lot of crossover.

698
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,750
‎就把他称为混帐饼干医师
We're going to call him Dr. Dick Biscuit.

699
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,040
‎好的 来啦
Okay, there it is.

700
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:28,500
‎在不经过任何检查后 ‎混帐饼干医师决定
Now, Dr. Dick Biscuit decided, after running no tests,

701
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,090
‎我道格拉斯不适症的解决方式…
that the solution to my Douglas malaise...

702
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,170
‎就是我该继续吃那个药（避孕药）
was that I should go on the pill.

703
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,140
‎药 男人命名一切 ‎还有更多的证据
The pill. There's more proof men have named all the things.

704
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,390
‎“那个药” 这很模糊吧
"The pill." That's a bit fucking vague, isn't it?

705
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:43,850
‎“医生 你大多开的处方签‎都叫做药”
"Most things you prescribe, Doctor, could be called a pill."

706
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,270
‎他说“是的 但这是那个药”
He's like, "Yes, but this is the pill. The pill."

707
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:49,060
It sounds like there's just a giant pill in the town square
‎听起来就象是小镇广场上 ‎有一颗巨大的药

708
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:51,270
‎我们都冲上去吃 ‎还喊着“今天星期一”
we all scurry out and nibble on, "Mmm, it's Monday."

709
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,940
‎“有什么效用 ” ‎“巫术 闭嘴 叫药就行了”

710
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:54,940
"What does it do?" "Witchcraft. Shut up. Call it a pill."

711
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,660
‎我对混帐饼干医师说 ‎“听着 我不想吃药
I said to Dr. Dick Biscuit, "Look, I don't want to take the pill.

712
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:03,370
‎我之前服过药 而药物让我有自杀的念头”
I've been on the pill before and the pill tends to give me suicidal ideation."

713
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,540
‎你以为我创伤都讲光了
[chuckles] You thought I was all out of trauma.

714
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,210
‎混帐饼干医师不喜欢我提这件事
Now, Dr. Dick Biscuit didn't enjoy me bringing that to the table.

715
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,420
‎这次诊断是诊断我的身体
The table being a consultation about my body.

716
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,590
‎他敬谢不敏
He's like, "No. No, thank you very much."

717
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,720
And do you know what he did? He shushed me.
‎你知道他做了什么 ‎他叫我闭嘴

718
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:20,260
He said, "You will do well to listen to me."
‎他说“你乖乖听我的话做”

719
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:22,720
It was our first fight.
‎这是我们第一次的争执

720
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:26,350
‎我做了在冲突中 ‎我都会做的事情
And I did what I always do in a bit of conflict.

721
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,140
‎我说了个笑话 这是我的笑话
I made a joke. This was my joke.

722
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:32,320
‎我说“与其吃药 ‎不如切除我的子宫吧”
I said, "Instead of going on the pill, how about I have a hysterectomy?"

723
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:35,690
‎是啊 你就听懂了 ‎我不知道他为何听不懂
Yep, you get it. I don't know why he didn't get it.

724
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,990
‎就笑话来说 这算是经典
As far as jokes go, that's a classic.

725
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,700
-I can't... -
‎我想不出

726
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,740
‎不是笑话的内容
think of a context where that wouldn't be a joke.

727
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,910
像是我究竟有什么本事 ‎能控制我的身体
Like, on what planet would I have control over my own body?

728
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:45,950
‎起码这里不行
Not this one.

729
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,790
‎显然这是个笑话
So clearly, it's a joke.

730
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,540
‎而且应该也很清楚 ‎因为我用玩笑词
And also, it should have been clear, because I used jokey words.

731
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,420
‎我并没有用正式的词汇
I didn't use formal terminology.

732
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,250
I did not say, "Hysterectomy."

733
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,340
‎我没说“子宫切除术”

734
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:57,590
‎我当时说的是“我们何不干脆整组拿掉好了 ”
What I said was, "Why don't we just whip out the whole kit and caboodle?"

735
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:02,800
‎如果这还不清楚是说笑 ‎我还接着说
Then, if that wasn't clear enough I was joking, I followed it up with,

736
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:05,640
"Besides, I've heard decluttering is in fashion, Doctor.
‎“而且我听说现在很流行清除多余物品 医师

737
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,890
‎这并不会带来生活乐趣”
And this does not spark joy."

738
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,360
‎感谢 我很开心
Thank you. I'm delighted.

739
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,400
‎我很开心你们都喜欢这个笑话
I'm delighted you enjoyed that joke.

740
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,360
‎因为混帐饼干医生不喜欢
Because Dr. Dick Biscuit did not.

741
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,240
‎他听不懂我的笑话
He did not get my joke.

742
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,280
‎于是我并不明白他的慈悲
And so, I did not get his humanity.

743
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:24,450
‎于是情况开始转为激烈 ‎他就开始对我大吼
And things just escalated from there, and he just began shouting at me.

744
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,620
‎然后他就展开言语攻击
Right? And when he just fully laid into me,

745
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,540
然后我开始哭
at which point I began to cry,

746
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:31,790
‎然后混帐饼干医师 ‎把我的痛苦当证据
and then Dr. Dick Biscuit took my distress as proof...

747
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:34,000
‎证明他诊断正确
his diagnosis was correct.

748
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,960
‎显然我荷尔蒙失调
Clearly, I was hormonal.

749
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:39,090
‎典型回避 混帐饼干
Classic cop-out, Dick Biscuit.

750
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,010
‎我的老天
Fuck me.

751
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,720
‎男人说女人荷尔蒙失调
Men calling women hormonal.

752
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,260
Pretty much it's the number one hobby of mankind of all time.
‎大概是人类有史以来的第一个习惯

753
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,680
‎就像男人可以说女人荷尔蒙失调
Like, a man is allowed to call a woman hormonal

754
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,440
‎只要女人说或是做了 ‎男人意料之外的事情时
just whenever a woman says or does something a man failed to predict.

755
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,850
That's it.
‎就这样

756
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,560
‎像是“我根本没想到会这样
It's like, "I wasn't expecting that,

757
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:57,780
‎显然你的里面乱七八糟
so, clearly, you're just a cluster fuck of internalized chaos

758
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,440
‎你注定就是个婊子”
you make up to be a bitch."

759
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:04,990
‎像是男人没有荷尔蒙 ‎而说女人是荷尔蒙失调
Like, men call women hormonal as if men don't have hormones.

760
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,910
‎这就是让我不爽的地方
That's the bit that shits me.

761
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:10,120
‎因为根据最新消息 兄弟 ‎你也有荷尔蒙
Because newsflash, fellas, you've got hormones.

762
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,460
‎因为有时候你会暴躁
And sometimes you get testy.

763
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,250
‎是啊 你就会
Yeah, you do.

764
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,250
‎有时候 凯伦用力捏一下
Sometimes Karen gives it a bit of a squeeze...

765
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,170
‎你就生气
and you get upset.

766
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,720
‎很公平 你也是人 ‎我们大家都会
And fair enough, you're only human. Happens to the best of us.

767
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,890
‎众人皆知我在满月的时候 ‎想要吃一口黑巧克力
Look, I've been known to want to nibble a bit of dark chocolate on a full moon.

768
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:26,800
我也不懂
I don't know.

769
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,350
‎巫术
- -Witchcraft.

770
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,310
‎但我绝不会对门出拳
But I've never had to punch a door.

771
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,230
‎我们都有自己的问题 兄弟
So we all have our things, fellas.

772
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:42,530
Like, honestly, what do you think "boys will be boys" means...
‎老实说 你以为“男生永远长不大”是什么意思

773
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,740
‎要是男人擅长中和荷尔蒙的话
if men are so good at neutralizing their hormones?

774
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,660
‎这不是性侵的方便借口
Like, it's not the convenient alibi for sexual assault

775
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,750
‎好多人好喜欢拿这个当作借口
that so many people are so desperate for it to mean.

776
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,250
‎“男孩永远长不大”什么意思
Know what "boys will be boys" means?

777
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:56,000
‎这表示还没让小子准备好 ‎面对这个世界
It means we are not preparing our boys for the real world.

778
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,210
‎这表示我们很清楚
It means we know.

779
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,260
‎我们清楚男孩子的贺尔蒙不受控
We know that boys are at the mercy of their hormones.

780
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:05,010
‎我们只是人文学上 ‎无法让他们对自己行为负责
We're just culturally incapable of holding them accountable for their actions,

781
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,550
‎所以我们让女人来负责
so we hold women accountable.

782
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,430
‎住手
Stop it!

783
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:13,520
‎这是圈套 你们这些白痴 ‎这是套 搁着就好
It's bait, you fucking idiots. It's bait. Leave it!

784
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,440
‎不要对号入座
It's not for you.

785
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,860
‎这不是集会
It's not a rally.

786
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:27,780
‎我靠
Fuck.

787
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,040
‎每次我这么做 我就觉得 ‎我在圈套周围走一圈
Every time I do that, I feel like I've got to walk around the bait.

788
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,250
‎我不需要我的贺尔蒙不理性
Look, I don't need my hormones to be unreasonable.

789
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,170
‎我只是想让男人了解这件事
I would just love men to know that.

790
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,760
‎我不需要…
Like, I don't need...

791
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,130
我可以就因为我不想 ‎而无理取闹
I can just be unreasonable 'cause I don't wanna.

792
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,140
‎我有很多我所谓的 ‎“河豚鱼时刻” 对吧
I have plenty of what I call "puffer fish moments." Right?

793
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,100
‎你知道河豚鱼
You know puffer fish?

794
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,850
那些鱼被惊动 ‎就会这样 “这就是解决之道”
Those fish that get startled and go, "Oh, this is a solution."

795
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:55,730
‎实则不然

796
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:55,810
It's not.

797
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,610
‎就是这样 ‎我充满了这种无能的愤怒
That's what happens. I get filled with this impotent fury

798
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:04,400
‎我对我所生气的事情 ‎根本束手无策
and I can't do anything about whatever it is I'm angry about,

799
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,860
所以我就会…
because I'm just like... [groaning]

800
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,910
‎“如果你吃我 我就会搞死你 ‎否则我就在这里”
"If you eat me, I'll fuck you up, but otherwise I'm just over here."

801
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,950
‎但让我变成河豚鱼只是一些小事
And it's only little things that'll set the puffer fish off.

802
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,290
‎鸡毛蒜皮的事 ‎不是大事 像是原始人饮食法
Little things. Not the big picture. Little things, like the paleo diet.

803
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:20,040
‎别对我鬼扯这东西
Don't even look sideways at me with that shit.

804
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:23,210
‎因为我的反应绝对失控
- -Because my response is out of control.

805
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,670
‎不成比例
It's disproportionate.

806
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,260
‎有人会很无辜的说“我在用原始人饮食法减肥”
Someone will just innocently say, "I'm on the paleo," and I'll go,

807
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,430
我大叫“是吗 ”
[yells] "Are you?

808
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,430
‎首先，我不在乎 ‎再来，你口很臭
First of all, I don't care. Two, your breath stinks.

809
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,480
‎拜托吃点纤维好嘛
Eat some fucking fiber, for fuck's sake.

810
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,400
‎第三 我们也不知道他吃了什么
Three, we don't know what they ate.

811
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:46,940
‎我们根本不知道 ‎真正的原始人吃什么
We have no clue what paleolithic humans actually ate.

812
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:53,030
But we are dead certain they didn't eat cauliflower popcorn, you prick!"
‎但打死我们也不相信 ‎他们吃花椰菜爆米花 你这混蛋

813
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:01,790
‎你瞧 这跟我月经有没有来 ‎根本没有关系
And, you see, it doesn't matter where on my cycle I am.

814
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,250
‎同样愤怒
Same rage.

815
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,800
‎《威利在哪里 》则是另一个
Where's Waldo? is another one.

816
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,260
‎去他的
[scoffs] Fuck him.

817
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:14,260
‎为什么是沃里 为什么
Because why is Waldo? Why? Why?

818
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,100
‎为何我们浪费这么多时间
Why have we wasted so many hours

819
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:20,980
‎好几代的儿时来找那个混球
out of the lives of generations of children looking for that prick?

820
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,980
‎因为你不断地寻找 ‎寻找算是投入
Because you look and look, and looking is an investment.

821
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,780
‎你开始在乎 然后你开始担心 ‎
You're caring, and then you start to worry.

822
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,110
“我希望他没事”
"I hope he's okay."

823
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,200
‎然后你找到他 一切都不重要了 ‎都不重要了
And then you find him and nothing is ever the matter. Ever!

824
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:36,950
‎他只是在度假 相当享受人生
He's only ever on holiday, having quite a nice time of it.

825
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,910
‎去你的 沃里
Fuck you, Waldo!

826
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,290
‎他该跟我们其他人一样找到自己
He should have to find himself, like the rest of us have to.

827
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,130
‎真的
Honestly.

828
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:52,800
‎如果你想看白人男性优越的童书模板
If you want to see a children's book illustration of white male privilege,

829
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:53,930
‎那个家伙绝对是
it is that guy.

830
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,680
‎因为这家伙以逸待劳
Because here is a man who makes no effort.

831
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,480
‎完全不出力帮自己
No effort to help himself,

832
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,690
‎然后完全希望地球上的每个人
yet fully expects everybody on Earth

833
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:07,070
‎一直以来在乎他究竟在哪里
to give a shit about his whereabouts at all times.

834
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:12,490
Just change your ugly fucking jumper, mate.

835
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:12,570
‎换一下你丑毙了的套头衫 兄弟

836
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,460
‎老实说 那愤怒就跟 ‎月亮和潮水起伏有关了
To be honest, that one does fluctuate depending on the moon and the tides.

837
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:29,420
‎但老实说 真是浪费我的情绪资源
But ultimately, what a waste of my emotional resources.

838
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,840
‎我同时也浪费在《忍者龟》上头
I also waste them on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

839
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,470
‎问题大了
[popping sound] Big issue.

840
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,010
‎都是多纳泰罗 告诉你原因
It's Donatello. I'll tell you why.

841
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,470
‎要是你不知道
Now, if you didn't know,

842
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,560
忍者龟是街头帮派
the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are a street gang,

843
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,690
‎奇怪的是 我对这没意见
and, weirdly, that is not my issue.

844
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,860
‎是漫画、电视影集 ‎也改编成电影
It's a comic book, television, film franchise

845
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,820
‎目标观众群大概就是青少年
and the target demographic for it is pretty much young boys.

846
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,990
‎忍者龟各个都有名字
Now, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have names.

847
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:57,370
‎米开朗基罗、李奥纳多、拉斐尔 ‎以及多纳泰罗
They are Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael, and Donatello.

848
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,410
‎他们是以文艺复兴艺术家来命名
They are named after Renaissance artists.

849
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:02,580
Because nothing says frescoes like nunchucks. Am I right?
‎因为没有说壁画像双截棍 ‎对吧

850
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,910
‎我说错了
I'm not right.

851
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,460
‎文艺复兴有意思的地方是
Now, the interesting thing about the Renaissance,

852
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,460
‎我们普遍了解的文艺复兴
what we popularly understand as the Renaissance

853
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,800
‎是意大利文艺复兴全盛时期 ‎非常短暂的艺术运动
is the Italian High Renaissance, and that was a very short art movement.

854
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,260
‎二十年 没了
Twenty years, over.

855
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:17,510
‎从1500年到1520年 就这样
It went from 1500 to 1520. Done.

856
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,890
‎米开朗基罗、李奥纳多、拉斐尔
Now, Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael,

857
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:23,390
‎这二十年都是他们艺术上颠峰的状态
all at the height of their artistic prowess during those 20 years.

858
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,560
‎多纳泰罗 惨了
Donatello, oh, no.

859
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,270
Oh, no, no, no, no. He was dead.

860
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,230
‎惨了 他死了

861
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,740
‎他1465年就死了
Dead by 1465.

862
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,990
‎他根本就不是街头帮派份子的一员
[yelling] He does not belong in their street gang!

863
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,490
‎他死了
He's dead!

864
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,460
‎你知道谁才属于那街头帮派吗

865
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,460
Do you know who belongs in that street gang?

866
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:47,960
‎提香 他才是正宗
Titian. By rights, it should be Titian.

867
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,920
‎你知道为何提香...
Do you know why Titian...

868
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,380
‎你知道为何提香不在那街头帮派里面
Do you know why Titian is not in that street gang?

869
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,760
‎因为那电视节目的目标族群
Because the target demographic of that television show

870
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,880
‎没有办法接受名字开头为提（奶子）
could not handle a name that begins with "tit"

871
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:59,010
‎就因为他们天杀的荷尔蒙
because of their fucking hormones.

872
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,970
‎我们还没让男孩子准备好 ‎面对真实世界
We are not preparing our boys for the real world.

873
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,270
‎或是男人写的历史 ‎这就奇了吧
Or history, which they wrote. Weird.

874
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,860
‎而且他们是陆龟
And they're tortoises.

875
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,400
‎他们不是海龟
They are not turtles!

876
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,690
‎他们是陆龟
- -They are tortoises.

877
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,280
‎陆龟是脚 海龟是蹼
Tortoises are the clomp, clomps. Turtles are the flip, flips.

878
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,160
‎我明白…
-Now, I understand... -

879
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:24,700
‎我明白他们突变 我懂
I understand that they're mutants. I get it.

880
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:27,290
‎但他们用双截棍
But they are using nunchucks.

881
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:31,840
‎这表示他们得要具备 ‎某些陆地的灵巧性
This means they need to have some terrestrial dexterity experience,

882
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,420
‎而且这还不够
and this is not enough!

883
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,170
‎我们没准备好让男孩子们 ‎面对真实世界
We are not preparing our boys for the real world.

884
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:40,340
‎要是他们去了加拉巴哥群岛呢 ‎屎了
What if they went to the Galapagos? Fucked.

885
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,690
‎我最近的河豚时刻爆发…
My most recent puffer fish...

886
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,070
‎是在跟一个家伙交谈
was during a conversation with this bloke

887
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:56,820
‎他想告诉我高尔夫不算是运动
who was trying to tell me that golf is not a sport...

888
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:01,070
‎因为对你的心血管系统 ‎没有造成压力
because it doesn't put stress on your cardiovascular system.

889
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,870
‎这不是挺没意思的吗
Isn't that not interesting?

890
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,040
‎不管你怎么转 无聊
Doesn't matter how you spin it. Dull.

891
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,000
‎情况继续恶化 因为他讲个没完
And it gets worse, because he kept talking.

892
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,500
‎他说“如果你参加一个
He said, "If you're participating in something

893
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:17,090
‎对于心血管系统没有压力的事
and it doesn't put stress on your cardiovascular system,

894
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:19,050
‎就不算是运动
you're not participating in a sport.

895
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,890
‎你只是在玩游戏”
You're merely playing a game."

896
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,850
‎那场对话让我超生气
And that conversation made me so fucking angry,

897
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:27,100
‎感觉挺像运动的
it felt like a sport.

898
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:32,480
‎我希望这里没人说“终于
Now, I hope nobody's in here, just going, "Finally, oh.

899
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,440
‎这里有人捍卫高尔夫的名誉”
Someone here to defend golf's honor."

900
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,400
‎这里绝对没有这种事
That is not what's happening here.

901
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:39,280
‎事实上 我希望高尔夫难过
In fact, I hope golf is sad.

902
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,570
‎我希望高尔夫满腹牢骚
I hope golf is all sooky la la,

903
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,620
‎因为我对高尔夫 ‎说多痛恨就有多痛恨
'cause I fucking hate golf with all the reasonable rage I can muster.

904
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:49,460
‎土地、时间、水资源的巨大浪费
What a monumental waste of land, time, and water.

905
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,120
‎搞什么鬼
For fuck's sake.

906
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:53,170
‎真的
- -Honestly.

907
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:56,250
‎有家室的男人还打高尔夫
Men who have families and play golf

908
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,630
‎简直是蠢蛋
are cunts.

909
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:02,050
‎你没时间 兄弟 你有个家庭
You don't have time, fellas. You've got a family.

910
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:04,760
‎没有空闲的六小时 ‎跟你的朋友在公园漫步
Not a spare six hours to just waltz around a park with your mates

911
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,470
‎让你的女人付出一切免费的劳力
while your womenfolk do unpaid labor!

912
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:08,890
‎成熟点
Grow up!

913
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,730
‎还有更多证据证明一切由男人命名
There's more proof men have named all the things.

‎你骂别人最难听的是什么
What's the worst thing you can call someone?

‎鲍鱼
Cunt.

916
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,070
‎这说的是女人的阴道 ‎我不能忍受
It's a reference to female genitalia, and I won't have it.

917
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,070
‎我说阴道的时候 ‎真的是指阴道
When I use the C-word, I mean it.

918
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:25,370
‎我认为这是你骂人最难听的话
I mean it to be the worst thing you can call someone,

919
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:29,330
‎但我不会扯上我自己的身理 ‎或是任何人的身理
but I don't associate it with my own biology or anybody's biology.

920
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:32,410
‎你知道我说阴道时会想到什么
Do you know what I see in my mind's eye when I use the C-word?

921
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,870
‎真正的高尔夫球手
A literal golfer.

922
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,340
‎一个有钱的白人大块头佬 ‎穿着斜纹布裤 戴一支手套
Just a rich, white chump in chinos and one glove.

923
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,420
‎十足的白痴

924
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,460
What a cunt.

925
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:45,510
Honestly, it cannot be a coincidence that they're called cunt-ry clubs.

926
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:45,510
‎老实说 会叫做老土（乡村）俱乐部 ‎一点也不奇怪

927
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:46,430
‎拜托
Come on.

928
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,650
I'll tell you what, my... my last show, Nanette,
‎跟你们说 我上个节目《娜娜》

929
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:56,610
‎让很多人像河豚爆怒
gave a lot of people the puffer fish.

930
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:58,610
Like, pfff, you know you've made it.

931
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:58,690
‎像是你明白你做到了

932
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:00,820
‎我说很多人 表示不只是男人
And I say people, but it was only men.

933
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,530


934
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,950
‎标签“并非都是男人” 好吗
Hashtag "not all men." Okay?

935
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:07,700
‎当然 不全都是男人
Of course, it's not all men.

936
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,660
‎从来就不全是男的
It's never been all men.

937
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:13,040
‎一般说来 真的只有 ‎使用那标签的人
Generally speaking, it's really only the men who use that hashtag.

938
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,500
‎就是他们
-They're the ones. -

939
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,920
‎你知道男人 意味着“我”
You know, men, pronounced "me."

940
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,210
‎他们挺身而出
You know, they're the ones who go out of their way

941
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:22,090
‎告诉我《娜娜》不是喜剧
to let me know that Nanette was not comedy.

942
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:26,590
‎“因为节目里每个梗都没让我笑出来”
"Because it didn't make me laugh every step of the way."

943
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:28,680
‎首先 很好
First of all, good.

944
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,770
‎要是那节目让你从头笑到尾 ‎你究竟有什么毛病
If that show made you laugh all the way through, what the fuck is wrong with you?

945
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:36,650
‎再来 我把笑话龙头关掉
Secondly, yes, I turned the laugh tap off myself.

946
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:38,230
‎这是我的决定 我坚持这点
It was a decision. I stand by it.

947
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:41,110
‎不是我到了节目一半 ‎觉得“惨了 我没笑话可说
It's not like I got halfway through and thought, "Fuck, I'm out of jokes.

948
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:43,240
‎决定说个悲伤故事”
I'll tell a sad story. I hope anyone won't notice."

949
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,870
‎我比任何人清楚 我在《娜娜》里 ‎所表演的技术上而言不算喜剧
I know better than anyone that what I did with Nanette was not technically comedy.

950
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:49,240
‎我也不是他妈的白痴
But I'm also not a fucking idiot.

951
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,080
‎我要那节目有观众 一批广大的观众
I wanted that show to have an audience, and a broad audience,

952
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,290
‎如果那表示我得骗人
and if that meant I had to trick people...

953
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:56,460
‎称之为喜剧…
by calling it comedy...

954
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,000
‎技术上而言就是笑话
that's technically a joke.

955
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:05,920
‎但我得说…
But I have to say...

956
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:10,600
‎我得说 一个不好笑的笑话 ‎让许多男人打从心底愤怒
I have to say, a bad joke made so many men so viscerally angry

957
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,680
‎我很惊讶没人控诉我写运动 真的
I'm surprised nobody accused me of writing a sport, honestly.

958
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:15,230
这...
-It... -

959
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,020
‎首先 我不在乎 是吧
Look, first of all, it doesn't bother me. Right?

960
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,230
‎这并不会困扰我
This doesn't bother me. Look, look.

961
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,570
‎我还拿着大声的麦克风 ‎我没有感到威胁
I've still got the loud stick. I don't feel threatened.

962
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:24,070
‎事实上 我喜欢那种痛恨
In fact, I-I like the hate.

963
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:26,740
‎死亡威胁靠边站 很有趣 ‎好好吃
Death threats aside, it's fun. Nom, nom, nom.

964
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,450
‎对吧 问题是每当我‎像河豚爆怒时
Right? But the thing is, whenever I have a puffer fish...

965
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,990
‎我总是开始假设
I always work under the assumption

966
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:37,080
‎问题大部分在我 对吧
that the problem is mostly me, right? If I'm like... [popping sound]

967
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,710
‎如果我这样… ‎感觉就不容易好好开始说话
It just doesn't seem like a good place to start a dialog.

968
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:42,880
‎我从没写信给多纳泰罗或是沃里
I have never written a letter to Donatello or Waldo.

969
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:46,090
‎没必要 一个死了 ‎一个从不回家
Like, no point. One's dead and one's never home.

970
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:47,510
‎但仍然 我…
But still, I just...

971
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:50,180
‎从没想过
Wouldn't occur to me.

972
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:53,470
‎但今天 我还收到男人 ‎直接在我推特上留言
But to this day, I still get men sliding into my DMs

973
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,640
‎让我知道 全部都大写 ‎
to let me know, in all caps,

974
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,770
说他们从没听过我
[loudly] that they've never heard of me.

975
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,400
‎这是个谜
It's a riddle.

976
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,730
‎他们怎么知道
How do they know?

977
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:09,070
‎我没办法体悟到羞辱 ‎我懂他们非常想让我感受到
Look, I can't experience the humiliation I know they're so desperate for me to feel

978
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:11,490
‎因为我没办法不担心他们
because I can't help but feel worried for them.

979
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:13,450
‎因为这样人生难过
Because that's a tough life.

980
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,200
‎如果新事物如此痛苦…
If new things are so painful...

981
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,500
‎这就是学习障碍了
Ow. They.... That's a learning difficulty.

982
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,620
Imagine school for someone like that.

983
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,620
‎想象一下 学校里有那种人

984
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,460
Long division.

985
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:21,540
‎长除法

986
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,340
‎“我他妈的从没听过”
[yells] "I've never fucking heard of it!"

987
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,630
‎我被控诉做过所有不道德的事情 ‎而非喜剧
I got accused of doing all sorts of nefarious things in lieu of comedy.

988
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,970
‎真的 像是独白
I really did. Like a monologue.

989
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,600
‎如果是真的 那还真是个怪兽
What a monster, if true.

990
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:39,350
‎一场受崇拜的TED演讲
A glorified TED Talk. Uh-oh.

991
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,560
‎独女秀
A one-woman show.

992
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:46,400
‎说教 天杀的说教
A lecture. A fucking lecture. Can you believe that one?

993
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,990
‎你相信吗 放肆地说教
The cheek of that one. A lecture.

994
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:51,110
‎《娜娜》不是说教 也不是独白
Nanette was not a fucking lecture. It wasn't a monologue either.

995
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,620
‎又不是我坐在板凳上 ‎在舞台灯下像条目瞪口呆的鲱鲤
It wasn't like I was sitting on a stool like a stunned mullet in a spotlight.

996
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,240
‎不是天杀的独白
It wasn't a fucking monologue.

997
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:59,710
‎受崇拜的TED演讲 ‎为何他们要崇拜
And a glorified TED Talk? Why do they need glorifying?

998
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:01,210
‎他们根本就很好
They are fine.

999
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:03,500
‎独女秀
And a one-woman show?

1000
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,500
‎认真 福尔摩斯
No shit, Sherlock!

1001
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,010
‎也不是天杀的说教
And it wasn't a fucking lecture.

1002
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:12,010
‎你想听说教 我就对你说教
You want a lecture? I'll give you a fucking lecture.

1003
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,590
‎这才是说教
This is a lecture!

1004
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,650
‎关于文艺复兴事实上
Now, there is some debate...

1005
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:33,780
as to when the High Renaissance actually began.
‎从何时开始 其实有些争论

1006
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:36,370
‎有人说1940年
Some put it at 1490,

1007
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:39,370
‎但有些人则说是1500年开始
while others argue it began in 1500.

1008
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:42,290
‎不论哪一个 多纳泰罗早死透了
Either way, Donatello was fucking dead.

1009
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:50,710
‎回到16世纪 凯伦的手非常冰
Back in the 16th century, Karen had very, very cold hands.

1010
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,680
‎暖个手 小凯 快点
Give them a rub, Kaz. Come on.

1011
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:57,850
‎这是拉斐尔的《雅典学院》
Now, this is Raphael's School of Athens.

1012
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:01,180
‎这就是拉斐尔非常好心地画出
This is where Raphael has so kindly painted all the men

1013
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:03,520
‎命名所有一切的男人
who named all of the things.

1014
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,650
‎现在…
-Now... -

1015
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:07,270
‎严格说来 ‎这些不是拉斐尔的当代人物
strictly speaking, these are not Raphael's contemporaries,

1016
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,400
‎虽然他用了他们的相似之处
although he has used their likeness.

1017
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,440
‎基本上这些是古希腊人物
But basically, these are the ancient Greeks,

1018
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:14,950
‎拉斐尔画这画的时候 ‎所有的希腊人早就死透了
and, by the time Raphael painted this, all the Greeks were dead.

1019
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:16,370
‎不是所有希腊人 ‎我非常抱歉
Not all the Greeks. I am so sorry.

1020
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:19,580
‎今天世界上仍有许多 ‎活着并且蓬勃的希腊人
There are still a lot of Greeks alive and thriving in the world today.

1021
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:20,660
‎哈啰 欢迎
Hello and welcome.

1022
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:23,290
‎不是的 只有古代希腊人 ‎他们全都死光了
No, just the ancient Greeks. They are all dead.

1023
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:26,500
They lived on a busy road. It was built by the ancient Romans.
‎他们住在由古罗马人 ‎建造的繁忙街道上

1024
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:31,670
‎我们这儿有谁呢 ‎有毕达哥拉斯
Now, who have we got here? We've got Pythagoras.

1025
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,010
‎他忙着命名所有三角形
He's busy naming all the triangles.

1026
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:37,220
‎这锐角（可爱）
That's acute one.

1027
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,350
‎还有苏格拉底
You've got Socrates here.

1028
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:44,640
‎他滚了一下 典型的苏格拉底
He took a bit of a tumble. Classic Socrates.

1029
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:47,520
‎非常善于思考 却经常绊倒 ‎起来 芝麻叶兄弟
Good with the thoughts, shit with the walk. Get up, mate. Arugula.

1030
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:50,820
‎所有男人忙着…
Now, what were the women doing

1031
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,780
‎命名一切的大事时 ‎女人都在干嘛呢
while all the men were doing the very important naming of all the things?

1032
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,150
‎就我研究的资料显示
From my research, what I gather,

1033
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:58,910
‎女人通常三个一组站在旁边 裸体
women were generally standing around in groups of three, naked,

1034
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:03,410
‎等着男人命名一切事物
just waiting for men to name all of the things.

1035
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,040
‎你可以看见中央的这位
You can see it happening with this central figure.

1036
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:09,130
‎她说“妳手里拿着什么 凯伦 ”
She's saying, "What have you got in your hand there, Karen?"

1037
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,470
‎“只是一些小东西”
"Oh, just a couple of bits and bobs."

1038
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:23,890
‎女人只是拿着东西 等着 ‎希望东西没有毒
Women were just holding things. Just waiting, hoping it wasn't poisonous.

1039
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:26,560
‎等着男人命名一切
Waiting for men to name the things.

1040
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,600
‎这是在床被命名之前画的
This was painted before beds were named.

1041
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:31,060
‎你可以看到女人非常想要整理床铺
You can see women desperately trying to make the beds,

1042
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:33,900
‎无可奈何地把床单抛在树上
just flinging the linen into the trees willy-nilly.

1043
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:37,400
‎说着“我不知道 搭个城堡好了
Just going, "Oh, I don't know. Mm, let's just build a fort.

1044
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:40,780
‎来搭个漂亮的城堡
We'll make it a fancy fort.

1045
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:45,080
‎太棒了 我们搭好城堡了”
Yay, we finished the fort!"

1046
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:49,080
‎三人在森林里裸体跳舞
Dancing naked in groups of three in the forest

1047
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:52,170
‎一直以来都是女人的第一嗜好
is the number one hobby of women of all time.

1048
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,500
‎我们超爱的吧
And don't we just love it.

1049
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:57,090
‎这不是你所听过最安全的事 ‎我们好爱
Isn't that the safest thing you've ever heard of? Oh, we love it.

1050
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:59,050
‎这可看起来象是个自由自在 ‎在林子里无拘无束嬉闹
Now, this might just look like a footloose,

1051
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:02,350
‎还是国定假日 没有问题
fancy-free frolic in the forest on a bank holiday, no drama.

1052
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,220
‎我再请你看看这一群
But let me draw your attention to this group here.

1053
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:10,100
‎单纯玩乐的话 显然太紧了
That is too tight for fun times alone.

1054
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,150
‎这意味着紧张
It suggests tension.

1055
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:14,730
‎发生什么事
- -What has happened?

1056
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,490
有人提到原始人饮食法
Has someone mentioned the paleo?

1057
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:18,110
‎没有
-No. -

1058
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,990
‎这里是说中间这位女士发现
What has happened is this central figure here

1059
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:22,320
‎这块布 纱布
has realized that this bit of cloth, this waft of gauze,

1060
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:24,280
‎这可能的城堡布…
this potential fort, if you will...

1061
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:28,080
‎一路上来到她的肛门
has made its way so far up her clacker...

1062
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:34,000
‎一路上来到她的肛门 ‎把她小妹妹遮住
So far up her clacker, it has both fannies covered.

1063
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,380
‎她超生气
And she is upset.

1064
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,590
‎值得此刻说明的是
Now, it's worth pointing out, at this juncture,

1065
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,220
‎这不是照片
that this is not a photograph.

1066
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,470
‎这不是一张意外的照片
-This is not an accidental photograph... -

1067
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:49,940
‎拍下不幸的时刻 尴尬
taken of an unfortunate moment. Awkward.

1068
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,770
‎不 这是一张画
No, what this is, is a painting.

1069
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:56,570
‎也就是说这是…
Which makes this...

1070
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,950
‎决定下的产物
[yells] a decision!

1071
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:07,700
‎这是男人的决定而且还在上面花时间
It's a decision that a man made and spent time on.

1072
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:41,780
‎我有自闭症
I have autism.

1073
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,700
‎一点点的独白
It's a tiny monologue.

1074
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:51,910
‎最近才诊断出来 仅四年前而已
I was very late diagnosed. Only four years ago.

1075
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:53,620
‎四年前诊断出来
Diagnosed four years ago.

1076
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:56,790
‎但我先自我诊断出来
But I-I self-diagnosed first,

1077
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,170
‎找专家前非常棒的方法
which is a great way to approach any specialist.

1078
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:00,800
‎他们很喜欢
Ooh, they love it. Oh.

1079
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,550
‎他们说“多告诉我一点你的想法”
They say, "Tell me more about what you think."

1080
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:08,430
‎我甚至想到自我诊断的唯一理由
But the only reason I even thought to self-diagnose

1081
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:10,970
‎因为大家不断告诉我
was because people kept telling me.

1082
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,190
It was usually after a show.
‎通常都是节目后

1083
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:15,900
‎就会有人上来跟我说 ‎“我觉得你有自闭症”
People would just come up to me and say, "I think you have autism."

1084
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,150
‎老实说我生命里每一位 ‎对我这么做的人
To be fair to every single person that's ever done that to me in my life,

1085
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:22,610
‎我认为他们全都在这光谱范围内
I think they were all on the spectrum.

1086
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:24,990
‎因为这叫做物以类聚
Because that's how we roll.

1087
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:28,580
Pretty much, it's like, "I have a piece of information you seem to be missing.
‎就好像是“我有你好像没有的信息”

1088
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,040
‎不管你有没有心理准备 ‎我还是告诉你吧
You may or may not be ready to hear this information,

1089
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,870
‎因为知识就是力量
but I'll tell you, because knowledge is power,

1090
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,210
无知是牢笼 ‎情绪可以慢慢处理
ignorance is a cage. and feelings can be dealt with.

1091
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:37,420
‎祝你顺心了”
I bid you good day."

1092
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,710
‎我的问题在于我不了解自闭症
My issue was I didn't understand enough about autism

1093
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,800
‎来明白我怎么会有自闭症
to understand how I could have autism.

1094
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,970
‎因为我们可能对自闭症的了解
Because what we popularly understand autism to be

1095
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:50,060
‎就是好像只有影响 ‎非常喜欢数学的小男孩
is just something that only affects young boys that like maths a lot.

1096
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:53,520
‎到今天为止 这些条件我身上都没有
And, to this day, neither of those things apply to me.

1097
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,560
‎所以大家来跟我说 ‎“我想你有自闭症”
So people would tell me, "I think you have autism."

1098
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,480
‎我的反应是 ‎“我不懂你怎么会这么想”
I'm like, "I don't understand how you got that."

1099
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,860
‎当然我打过疫苗 除此外…
I mean, sure I've been vaccinated, but other than that...

1100
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,320
欧，嘿!
Oh, hey!

1101
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,280
‎来了
Here it is. Oh.

1102
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:06,400
‎你们自己系好了
Strap yourselves in.

1103
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:12,040
‎在所有自闭症相关的有毒迷思中 ‎这个应该是摆在第一位
Of all the toxic myths about autism, that's got to be right up the top.

1104
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,750
‎至少不是因为我们知道
Not least because we know...

1105
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:18,000
‎疫苗不会引发自闭症
[chuckles] that vaccinations do not cause autism.

1106
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,540
‎你知道什么才会引发自闭症
Do you know what causes autism?

1107
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:22,170
‎不 鬼才知道
No. You fucking don't.

1108
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:26,550
-And if... -

1109
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:25,550
‎而且如果…

1110
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,840
‎如果你真的以为你知道
If you honestly think you do,

1111
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:32,140
‎那就是你的自信让你傻了
your confidence is making you stupid.

1112
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,390
‎我也知道我说什么也不能
Now, I also know that there's nothing I can say

1113
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,440
‎改变反疫苗人士的心态
that can change an anti-vaxxer's mind.

1114
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,440
‎我很清楚 ‎因为封闭的心灵不是如此运作
I know that, because that's not how closed minds work.

1115
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,650
‎根本没在运作
They don't work.

1116
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:45,070
‎打烊了 对吧
They're closed for business. Right?

1117
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:48,030
‎要打开封闭的心灵 必须由内部执行
So... like, to open a closed mind, it has to be an inside job.

1118
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:50,870
‎所以我很清楚我没办法 ‎改变反疫苗人士的心态
So I know there's nothing I can do that'll change an anti-vaxxer's mind.

1119
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,660
I'm gonna have a go anyway. Gonna have a go.
‎但我还是继续说吧

1120
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:56,000
‎因为我的理论是 说他们心灵封闭
Because my theory is, by accusing them of having a closed mind,

1121
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:59,000
‎他们肯定说“不 我才没有” ‎然后我就能进去了
they'll be reactive and go, "No, I don't," and I'll get in.

1122
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:03,750
‎而且现场这里绝对有反疫苗人士
And there will be anti-vaxxers in this room. Absolutely.

1123
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:07,550
‎别自己对号入座 千万不要 ‎这不是重点
Do not identify yourselves. Do not. That is not what's happening here.

1124
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:10,180
‎你们为数众多
You are outnumbered.

1125
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:12,640
‎我知道你喜欢刻意操弄统计
And I know you like to willfully manipulate statistics,

1126
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,220
‎但这根本就不是在说你
but this is even beyond you.

1127
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:17,730
‎更何况…
And also...

1128
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,940
‎现场的确有反疫苗人士 绝对没错
And there will be anti-vaxxers in this room, make no mistake,

1129
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,940
‎因为我的核心人口统计 ‎是富有白人符合资格的女性
because my core demographic is rich, white, entitled women,

1130
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:28,490
‎而且是一张很多交错的维恩图
and that is a Venn diagram with a lot of crossover.

1131
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:34,700
‎但如果你是反疫苗人士
But if you are an anti-vaxxer,

1132
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:37,500
‎我向你保证 ‎接下来的你一点也不喜欢
I can guarantee you, you will not like this next bit.

1133
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:41,620
‎但如果你整场节目都能欢乐带过
But if you've been laughing the whole way through the show

1134
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:43,040
‎结果突然这时候停下来
and you suddenly stop now,

1135
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:44,670
‎大家就都了了
everyone will know.

1136
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:49,840
‎所以你也不希望这样
So if that's not what you want to happen...

1137
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,510
‎建议你这样做
just do a bit of this.

1138
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,970
‎你肯定不喜欢 但这样做就对了
You will not be enjoying it. Just do a bit of that.

1139
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:02,400
‎好了 反疫苗人士 就假装你是对的
All right, anti-vaxxers. Let's pretend you're right.

1140
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,360
‎你实际上不是
You're not.

1141
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,530
‎假装不是科学 但我们来…
Pretending is not science, but let's...

1142
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:15,160
Let's im-- Let's pretend you're right, that vaccinations cause autism.
‎我们来假装你是对的 ‎疫苗引发自闭症

1143
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,200
‎事实上并不会
They don't.

1144
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:20,040
‎现在怎样
Now what?

1145
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,420
‎因为就存在自闭症范围内的人
Because, as somebody who exists on the autism spectrum,

1146
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,710
‎让我来对你说
let me say this to you.

1147
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:28,170
‎我非常乐意身在其中
I'm happy to take one for the team.

1148
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:30,920
‎我并不是说自闭症很容易
And I'm not suggesting that autism is easy.

1149
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:32,840
‎绝对不是 非常艰难
It isn't. It is difficult.

1150
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:35,100
‎我不会也无法否认
And I will not and cannot deny that.

1151
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:37,850
‎但就算生命很苦 但能活着就很棒
But as difficult as this life is, it's nice to have a life,

1152
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:40,020
and it's particularly nice to have that life
‎尤其是活在这样一个世界

1153
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,940
一个没有
in a world without...

1154
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:43,100
‎小儿麻痺症的世界
[yells] polio!

1155
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:49,980
‎小儿麻痺症很不好
Polio is bad!

1156
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:54,740
‎这是事实 不是感受
And that is a fact, not a feeling.

1157
00:56:55,870 --> 00:57:00,660
‎我宁愿罹患自闭症 ‎而不想跟你一样没良心
And I would much prefer to have autism than be a sociopath like you.

1158
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,080
‎让我解释清楚
Let me explain.

1159
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:07,630
‎如果你真的认为你的孩子 ‎你唯一的独生子
'Cause if you honestly think that your child, your only, single child,

1160
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:10,800
‎比所有的孩子还重要…
is more important than all the other children collectively,

1161
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:12,880
‎你根本就不想融入
you're not playing for the team.

1162
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:14,590
‎如果你不想
And if you don't want to play for the team,

1163
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,680
那你干嘛生孩子
why the fuck are you even having children?

1164
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,720
‎找个石头宠物
Get a pet rock

1165
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:22,310
把你的部落格删除
and delete your fucking blog!

1166
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,440
‎终于抒发了
Got that off my chest.

1167
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:35,700
‎我也很清楚 一旦这上线直播 ‎这小小的桥段…
Now, I do know that once this is streaming, that little bit...

1168
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:39,490
‎将让我置身在反疫苗运动的
is opening me up to a whole world of a hate campaign

1169
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:40,740
‎仇恨阵营世界里面
from the anti-vax movement.

1170
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:43,620
‎但 千万别搞错 他们彼此协调
Because, make no mistake, they are coordinated.

1171
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,960
‎不是随机 他们像个邪教
They are not random. They are a cult.

1172
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,500
‎但我只是…
And I've only been...

1173
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,840
‎我只是一次一个地方谈这话题
I've only been telling this material one room at a time,

1174
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,880
‎而这仇恨就已经渗入
and the hate is already trickling in,

1175
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,680
‎而且瞄准目标还有毒
and it is targeted, and it is venomous.

1176
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:58,930
‎但我并不在意 ‎别担心
But it doesn't bother me. Don't worry about it.

1177
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:00,600
我当点心
Like, I snack on it. "Mmm, nom, nom, nom."

1178
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,810
‎真的…没事的
-It's really... It's fine. -

1179
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:06,520
‎你知道我为什么这么做 ‎我为何把仇恨当点心 你懂了吗
You have worked out why I do that, yeah? Why I snack on hate? You've worked it out?

1180
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,810
‎这是你增强免疫的方法 ‎叫做微量用药
It's how you build up immunity. It's called micro-dosing.

1181
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:15,280
‎是的 你的仇恨就是我的疫苗
Yeah. Your hate is my vaccine.

1182
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:21,280
‎你还能怎么样 ‎我已经罹患自闭症了
What are you gonna do? I've already got autism.

1183
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:32,210
‎我罹患所谓的高效自闭症
I have what's called high-functioning autism,

1184
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,630
‎这名字相当可怕
which is a terrible name for what I have,

1185
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:37,930
‎因为这让大家以为我效能高
because it gives the impression that I function highly.

1186
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:39,930
‎我才没有
- -I do not.

1187
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,810
‎让你们了解处于光谱范畴内 ‎是什么感觉
To give you an idea of what it feels like to be on the spectrum,

1188
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:46,680
basically, it feels like being the only sober person in a room full of drunks.
‎基本上说来就是在一间 ‎众人皆醉我独醒的房间里

1189
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:47,730
‎或是相反的情况
Or the other way around.

1190
00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:51,690
‎基本上就是你跟每一个人格格不入
Basically, everyone is operating on a wavelength you can't quite key into.

1191
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:53,070
‎让你用看的
To give you a visual...

1192
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:54,780
‎这个女人…
This woman...

1193
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:00,410
‎就是在自闭症光谱范畴下 ‎那就是…
is on the spectrum. That is...

1194
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:03,370
‎我他妈的生活故事
the story of my fucking life.

1195
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:08,500
‎真的 “上周同样时间 ‎同样地点的丧礼
Honestly. "Oh, it was a funeral same place, same time last week.

1196
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,250
‎我为何没收到通知
Why didn't I get the memo?

1197
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,590
‎他们干嘛亲嘴 我不喜欢那声音
Why are they kissing? I don't like the sound."

1198
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:21,760
‎我从没收过通知 从来没有
I never get the memo. I never do.

1199
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,220
我永远错过通知
I've always missed the memo.

1200
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:25,220
‎我记得很清楚 ‎从身为老师的爱将
I remember going from being the teacher's pet

1201
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:29,480
‎到课堂中把老师的克星带来
to bring the teacher's nemesis in one lesson.

1202
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:33,650
‎直到被诊断出来之前 ‎我从不明白究竟发生了什么事
And until I was diagnosed, I never understood what had happened.

1203
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:38,400
The lesson was on prepositions, so strap yourselves in for this story.
‎那堂课上的是介词 ‎所以各位听之前先系好安全带了

1204
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:40,990
‎我的确喜欢我的老师 ‎她是位好老师
Now, I do like my teacher. She was a good teacher.

1205
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:44,160
I liked the way she explained things, but we lost each other this way.
‎我喜欢她解释的方式 ‎但因此我们误解彼此

1206
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,950
‎她一开始上课是这样的 ‎“想象一个盒子”
This is how she began the lesson. She said, "Imagine a box."

1207
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,960
‎这我行 我生来就爱想象
And I could do that. I was gifted to a point.

1208
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,620
‎脑海里就出现扎扎实实的盒子
Visual thinker. Good box, solid.

1209
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:53,040
‎立体朴实但存在的盒子
Three-dimensional, nothing fancy, but there.

1210
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:56,170
‎接着她说“介词…
And then she said, "A preposition

1211
00:59:56,250 --> 01:00:00,300
is a word that explains your relationship to the box."
‎是解释你跟盒子关系的字”

1212
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,300
‎我的思绪在此瓦解
And that's when my thinking just fell apart,

1213
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:06,640
‎因为我心想“我跟盒子有关 ”
because I thought, "I'm related to a box?"

1214
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:11,310
‎接着她又说了 ‎“现在你可以在盒子后面
Then she said, "Now, you can be behind the box.

1215
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:13,860
‎有人知道那里是什么介词 ”
Does anybody know what the preposition is there?"

1216
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:16,110
‎他们不知道 但我有问题
No, they didn't, but I had a question.

1217
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:20,030
‎我说“我是盒子生的吗 ”
I said, "Am I made of box?"

1218
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,070
‎让我解释一下我的想法
Now, let me bring you into my thinking there.

1219
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,660
‎我认为如果我跟盒子有关 ‎我们一定有相同的基因
I thought if I was related to a box, we must share DNA,

1220
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:28,660
‎所以我脑袋里的逻辑
and it made more sense in my head

1221
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:31,750
that I would be made of box than the box would be made of me.
‎我是盒子生的 ‎而不是盒子是我生的

1222
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,540
‎但我老师从来不知道
But my teacher was not privy

1223
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,590
‎我脑袋瓜里打转的这一切想法
to that gifted train of thought circling my head there.

1224
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:40,380
‎她有点惊讶 然后说 ‎“不 汉娜 妳不是盒子生的
So she was a bit thrown, and she said, "No, Hannah, you're not made of box.

1225
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:43,090
‎我很惊讶妳会这么问
I'm surprised you had to ask that.

1226
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:50,270
‎好 那妳可以到盒子前面
So, okay, you can be in front of the box then.

1227
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:52,440
‎有没有人知道那里的介词是什么 ”
Does anybody know what the preposition is there?"

1228
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,690
‎不 他们不知道 但我又有问题了
No, they didn't. But I had another question.

1229
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:58,320
‎我说“这盒子有名字吗 ”
I said, "Does the box have a name?"

1230
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:03,200
‎我认为如果我有了名字 ‎我就能搞清楚我们什么关系
I thought if I had a name, I could work out how we were related.

1231
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,990
‎也许我们是亲戚
Maybe we were cousins.

1232
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:07,870
‎她说“不 只是盒子
And she said, "No, it's a box.

1233
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:10,410
‎盒子没有名字 汉娜
- -Boxes don't have names, Hannah.

1234
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:13,160
‎你知道哪个盒子有名字的吗 ”
What boxes do you know have names?"

1235
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:16,040
‎我开始列出早餐谷片
And I started listing breakfast cereals.

1236
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:21,670
‎她说“好的 够了
She's like, "All right, okay.

1237
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:26,390
‎你可以在盒子旁边 ‎有人知道那里是什么介词 ”
You can be beside the box. Does anybody know what the preposition is there?"

1238
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:27,350
‎不 他们不知道
No, they didn't.

1239
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:29,180
但我又有问题了
-But I had another question. -

1240
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:31,270
‎我不记得我这问题后面的逻辑
I don't remember my thinking behind this question,

1241
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:34,390
‎但我记得我问了 ‎因为我问的时候 大家都笑了
but I remember asking it, because when I did, everybody laughed

1242
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,650
‎我根本搞不清楚原因
and I had no idea why.

1243
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:39,480
‎但我记得真的非常喜欢那种感受
But I remembered really liking the feeling.

1244
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:43,780
‎问题是这样的
This was the question.

1245
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:46,490
‎我说“我可以吃盒子吗 ”
I said, "Am I allowed to eat the box?"

1246
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:53,160
‎当然 大家都在笑 ‎就剩老师跟我没笑
Of course, yes, everybody is laughing, except me and the teacher.

1247
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:56,330
‎回头想想 我不知道她为何没笑
Looking back, I don't know why the fuck she wasn't laughing.

1248
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:58,880
‎就笑话的角度 这算经典了
-As far as jokes go, that's a classic. -

1249
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,340
‎一个小蕾丝边在问盒子（阴道俚语）能不能吃
A baby dyke just asked if she was allowed to eat the box.

1250
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:06,840
‎她不觉得好笑 ‎她回答“好了 够了”
She didn't think it was funny. She was like, "Okay. All right. Okay.

1251
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,640
Calm down. Okay, we might be on the wrong track.
‎冷静 好了 我们可能有点误会

1252
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:15,440
‎不然我们想想另外跟盒子有关的
How about we imagine something else in relation to the box then?

1253
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:17,650
‎好吗 企鹅如何
Okay? How about a penguin?

1254
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:22,280
‎现在 企鹅可以在盒子里面
Now, the penguin can be inside the box.

1255
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,690
‎有人知道那里该用什么介词 ”
Does anybody know what the preposition is there?"

1256
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:28,410
‎不 他们不知道 ‎但我对于企鹅有个天杀的问题
No, they didn't, but I had some fucking questions about the penguin.

1257
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:31,660
‎我问“企鹅是什么生的 ”
- -I said, "What is the penguin made of?"

1258
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:36,000
‎这就是让我老师 ‎崩溃的最后一根稻草了
And that was the question that broke my teacher.

1259
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,080
‎你知道老师什么时候抓狂
You know you've broken a teacher

1260
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:41,090
‎就是从不出口成脏的老师‎满嘴脏话的当下
when a teacher who never swears swears bad.

1261
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:44,420
‎我继续问“企鹅是什么生的 ”
So I went, "What's the penguin made of?"

1262
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:46,970
‎她就说“企鹅 我是说…
And she's like, "Penguin? I mean... [exhales]

1263
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:49,590
‎是他娘的企鹅生的”
It's made of fucking penguin!"

1264
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:54,060
‎就答案来说 这太甜美了…
And as far as answers go, that's... mwah."

1265
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:57,100
‎简直是无懈可击
- -Like, that is watertight.

1266
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,520
‎这是个精彩的回答
That is a stunning answer.

1267
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,350
‎绝对没有其他逻辑
You can't logic out of that answer.

1268
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:01,860
绝对是个好答案
That is a good answer.

1269
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,610
‎但到那时候 我才觉得 ‎“我也许误会大了”
At that point, I thought, "I might be on the wrong track."

1270
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:07,360
‎但我还有其他的问题
But I had other questions pressing,

1271
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,280
‎但我心想“现在不是时候 ‎她好像抓狂了”
but I thought, "Now doesn't seem the time. She seems upset."

1272
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:13,700
‎所以我想“我还是把问题缓一缓好了”
So what I thought is, "I might hang on to my question."

1273
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,580
‎我当时这样想 但我错了
That's what I thought, and that was my mistake.

1274
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:18,620
‎趁我们僵持的时候 ‎我该直接问才对
I should have asked my question then while we were in the thick of it...

1275
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:20,500
‎否则都没有了
or not at all.

1276
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,880
‎因为我做了最差的处理
Because I did the worst possible thing.

1277
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,420
‎我等到她感觉安全以后
I waited until she felt safe.

1278
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,840
‎接着我问了我的问题
Then I asked my question.

1279
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,180
‎但我等了很久 ‎甚至到了别堂课
But I waited so long, it wasn't even the same lesson.

1280
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:34,220
‎是那天后来的阅读课
It was much later in the day, in silent reading.

1281
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,640
‎我等了这么久 甚至都不算是问题了

1282
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:38,640
I waited so long, it wasn't even a question anymore.

1283
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:40,980
‎比较像是理论 结果搞得更糟
It was more of a theory, and that made it worse.

1284
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:44,650
‎我问“要是如果…
I said, "What if...

1285
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,360
‎企鹅吃了盒子怎么办
the penguin ate the box?

1286
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:53,910
‎那么你不觉得 ‎企鹅也算是盒子生的 ”
Wouldn't then you say the penguin's a little bit made of box?"

1287
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:56,450
‎她说“出去”
She's like, "Get out."

1288
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:59,710
‎那是第一次 但并非最后一次 ‎我觉得我莫名其妙地
And that was the first, but not the last time, I was sent out

1289
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:02,210
‎被赶出教室
for reasons I had no idea why.

1290
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:07,760
‎因为问题是我非常投入在那堂课里
Because the thing is, I was genuinely engaged in that lesson.

1291
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:11,130
‎我真的想知道是什么介词
Like, I really-- I really wanted to know what a preposition was.

1292
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:13,140
‎我不是坐在那里说“介词
I wasn't sitting there going, "Prepositions?

1293
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:15,220
‎我他娘的从没听过”
[yells] I've never fucking heard of them!"

1294
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:18,600
‎但她后来跟我解释
But as she explained to me later,

1295
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:21,140
‎她说“你在故意装傻（顿角）”
she said, "You were being deliberately obtuse."

1296
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,310
‎我回答“但我不是三角形”
I'm like, "But I'm not a triangle."

1297
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:29,280
‎那天我没学到介词
I did not learn what a preposition was that day.

1298
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:31,400
‎我现在学会了 那都过去了
Look, I understand what they are now. I'm all over it.

1299
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:34,070
‎我也明白如果企鹅吃盒子
And I also understand, if the penguin ate the box...

1300
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:37,910
‎那企鹅就在盒子的周围
the penguin would be around the box.

1301
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:47,630
‎老实说 我被诊断出自闭症的那天 ‎简直就是晴空万里
Honestly, the day I was formally diagnosed with autism was a very good day.

1302
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:52,510
‎因为那像是有人给了我一把 ‎我的自我城市的大门钥匙
Because it felt like I'd been handed the keys to the city of me.

1303
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:54,760
‎因为我终于搞懂
Because I was able to make sense

1304
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:58,100
‎许多一直困惑我的事情
of so many things that had only ever been confusing to me.

1305
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:01,640
‎像是为何我这么聪明 ‎还要拼命留下证据
Like why I could be so intelligent but struggle to leave any proof.

1306
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:07,480
‎为何我不会填表格 为何…
Why I can't fill in forms. Why...

1307
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:12,280
‎为何我这一辈子都感到 ‎如此深沈的孤立
Wh-- Why I felt such a profound sense of isolation my entire life,

1308
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:14,820
‎不论我多努力想融入大家
despite trying so hard to be part of the team.

1309
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:18,660
‎这是光谱范畴下的大事 ‎就是寂寞
And that is a big thing about being on the spectrum. It is lonely.

1310
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:20,660
I find it very difficult to connect to others,
‎我感觉与他人建立关系非常困难

1311
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:25,120
‎因为我的脑袋把我带到 ‎无人居住的地方
because my brain takes me to places where nobody else lives.

1312
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:27,670
‎你不能一开始跟人
And you can't just start talking to people

1313
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:30,210
‎在狗公园里谈道格拉斯凹陷
about the Pouch of Douglas at the dog park.

1314
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:35,050
People do not like it. And I tried more than once.
‎大家不喜欢 我试过不只一次

1315
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:41,020
‎但我不是在此要求你们怜悯 ‎我在此是干扰你们的自信
But I'm not here to collect your pity. I'm here to disrupt your confidence.

1316
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,690
‎因为我显然努力用了方法 ‎分享我的想法
Because, clearly, I've worked out a way to share my thinking.

1317
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:46,190
‎不是吗
Haven't I?

1318
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:50,320
‎这叫什么随便你
Like, you can call this whatever the fuck you need to call this.

1319
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,320
‎独白
A monologue.

1320
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:52,860
说教
A lecture.

1321
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:55,860
‎你说“西红柿” ‎我说“蕃茄酱 繁忙街道”
You say "Tomato," I say, "Ketchup, busy road."

1322
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:57,030
‎让我让你好懂一些
Let me dumb it down for you.

1323
01:05:57,110 --> 01:05:58,490
‎本节目是解释
What this show is

1324
01:05:58,570 --> 01:06:01,540
你认为你觉得
is a metaphorical preposition that explains the relationship

1325
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:04,210
‎你了解我所想的与我真正能想的
between what you think you think you see me think...

1326
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:06,790
‎这两者间的暗喻介词
and what I'm genuinely able to think.

1327
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:09,880
‎因为我喜欢我想的方式
Because I like the way that I think.

1328
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:12,170
‎如果这世界是对的 而我身处其中
If the world is right and I'm right in it,

1329
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:14,760
‎我可以找到我的扩增拉链 ‎我的思考就能扩充
I can find my funny zip and my thinking expands.

1330
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,390
‎我思考的方式有其瑰丽之处
There is beauty in the way that I think.

1331
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:19,430
I don't think outside the box.
‎我并非跳脱传统思考

1332
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:22,680
But, as it turns out, if I ask nicely,
‎但 结果却是 ‎如果我有礼貌地问

1333
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:25,850
‎是的 我可以吃盒子
yes, I am allowed to eat the box.

1334
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:28,560

‎好个讨厌鬼
What a cunt.

1340

Now, this is Saint Bernard.
‎这是圣伯纳

1341
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,120
‎那是圣伯纳 那是圣母
That's Saint Bernard, that's the Virgin Mary,

1342
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,960
‎那是耶稣宝宝 那是头小狮子
that's the baby JC, and that is a tiny lion.

1343
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:51,290
‎你看得出来这幅画主要在干嘛
Now, can you see the main action that's going on in this picture?

1344

‎‎你看得出来他们在干嘛 圣母…
Can you see what's happening? The Virgin Mary...

1345

-[squirting sound] -G'day.

1347
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:02,640
‎这家伙说
Now, this guy's going,

1348
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,390
“你知道 ‎我通常是画里最怪的
"You know, look, I'm-- I'm usually the weirdest thing in a picture.

1349
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:07,350
I'm a tiny lion."
‎我是头小狮子“

1350
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,440
‎但牠不是
But he's not though,

1351
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:11,730
because the Virgin Mary is lactating on his fucking face.
‎因为圣母朝他脸上喷乳汁

1352
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,280
‎这张画说明伯纳如何成为圣伯纳
Now, this picture tells the story of how Bernard became Saint Bernard.

1353
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,190
‎以前 他只是普通的老伯纳
One day, he was regular old Bernard.

1354
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:18,740
‎然后他看见了个景象
And then he had a vision.

1355
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:21,660
‎在那个景象中 圣母出现在他眼前…
And in that vision, the Virgin Mary appeared to him...

1356
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:25,540
‎然后朝他脸上喷乳汁
and lactated on his fucking face.

1357
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:29,210
‎我并不批评这家伙 ‎我们都有梦来着
Now, I'm not judging the bloke. We've all had the dreams.

1358
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:31,960
‎我们都梦过 接着起床后 ‎对自己说
We've all had them, where we wake up and go,

1359
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:33,840
“我还不知道自己有这一面”
"I did not know that about myself."

1360
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:36,260
‎没事的
It's fine.

1361
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:38,300
‎奇怪的事情是 他醒来后
What's weird though is he did not wake up and go,

1362
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:40,470
"I might file that under 'Secret.'"
‎说“我不打算当作秘密”

1363
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:43,350
‎不 他没有这么做
No, that's not what he did.

1364
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:45,850
‎他醒来之后说“我该告诉大家”
He woke up and said, "I'd better tell the fellas."

1365
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:49,140
‎然后大家开会说“这太神了
And then the fellas have a meeting and go, "This is amazing.

1366
01:07:49,230 --> 01:07:50,980
‎我们最把这人视作圣人”
We'd better call this one a saint."

1367
01:07:51,730 --> 01:07:53,560
‎他现在成为圣人 因为… ‎什么
He's a saint now, 'cause... What? Sorry?

1368
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:54,860
‎什么
What?

1369
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:59,110
‎他成了圣人就因为他做了春梦
He's a saint 'cause what? He had a wet dream?

1370
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:01,700
‎他居然就成了圣人
And now he's a fucking saint?

1371
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:06,160
‎他目睹了喷乳汁的奇迹 ‎结果就成了圣人
He witnessed the miracle of lactation and now he's a saint?

1372
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:10,830
‎他杜撰了自己的事 ‎现在却成了天杀的…
He made it about himself, and now he's a fuck...

1373
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,630
‎这水平也太低了
This is a low bar.

1374
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:16,050
‎这就是男人命名一切事物的证据
This is proof men have named all the things

1375
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,090
‎而且支配整个游戏
and rigged the fucking game.

1376
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:19,340
‎这还不够
This is not enough.

1377
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:20,970
‎那就来谈谈菁英体制
Let's talk about a meritocracy.

1378
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:22,970
‎这位是圣则济利亚
Now, this is Saint Cecilia.

1379
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:27,180
‎她得学天杀的大提琴
She had to learn the fucking cello!

1380
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:29,680
‎小伯做了什么
What did Bernie do?

1381
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:37,860
It is not enough.
‎这还不够

1382
01:08:40,570 --> 01:08:44,030
Isn't it weird that the cello has been invented,
‎发明大提琴而没发明乐谱架

1383
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,660
‎不是很奇怪吗
but not the music stand?

1384
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:50,290
Why are they still relying on small, naked babies?
‎为何他们还要靠裸体小孩

1385
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,170
‎这是我最爱的一幅画
This is my favorite painting.

1386
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:58,300
‎这是《阿尔巴女爵》 由西班牙伟大的艺术家哥雅所绘
This is The Duchess of Alba by the great Spanish artist Goya.

1387
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:01,800
‎我喜欢是因为 ‎她付了一大笔钱画这幅画
I love it because she would have paid a pretty penny for this portrait,

1388
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,720
and she paid that pretty penny
‎她也的确付了那笔钱

1389
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:07,430
just so she could tell people for centuries to come...
‎让她可以后世的所有人

1390
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:09,850
‎她有穿鞋
that she's got shoes on.

1391
01:09:11,890 --> 01:09:14,350
"I've got shoes on! I've got shoes on!

1392
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:14,350
‎“我有穿鞋 各位 ‎我有穿鞋”

1393
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,560
各位 ‎我有穿鞋
Y'all, I got shoes on!"

1394
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:20,030
‎这是我想想在狗公园里 ‎那只小灵狗说的话
That is what I imagine the whippet was saying in the dog park.

1395
01:09:20,110 --> 01:09:21,320
‎“我有穿鞋”
"I got shoes on!"

1396

‎女人卡在岩石里
Women getting stuck to rocks

1397
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:32,160
‎是女人有史以来的第二嗜好
is the number two hobby of ladies of all time.

1398
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:35,540
All time.
‎一直以来都是

1399
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:38,710
This is under... This one's made of rock.
‎这是在…这是石头刻的

1400
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:42,130
They are just getting stuck. Look, what is happening here?
‎她们就是卡在那里 ‎究竟发生什么事情

1401
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:44,470
‎看…这是…什么情况

That is a salty, salty body of water.
‎那是海水

1403
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:49,560
‎她根本没在游泳
Like, she's not swimming.

1404
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:52,430
她只是靠屁屁滑过表面
She's just skating across the surface on her fanny.

1405
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:55,270
‎你的膝盖在干嘛
What do you do with your knees?

1406
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:58,110
‎猫中风了
Cat's had a stroke.

1407
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:08,780
‎这家伙说“感谢老天 你没穿衣服 ‎我在画风景画”
This guy went, "Thank God you're in the nude. I'm painting a landscape."

1408
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:14,750
