1
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:12,279
Iceland is a stable democracy with a high standard of living -

2
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,906
- and, until recently -

3
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,284
- extremely low unemployment and government debt.

4
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,040
We had the complete infrastructure of a modern society.

5
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,918
Clean energy, food production.

6
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,504
Fisheries with a quota system to manage them.

7
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,756
Good healthcare, education, clean air.

8
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:34,843
Not much crime.

9
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,346
It's a good place for families to live.

10
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,389
We had almost end-of-history status.

11
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,855
But in 2000, Iceland's government began a broad policy of deregulation -

12
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,691
- that would have disastrous consequences -

13
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:53,862
- first for the environment and then for the economy.

14
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,825
They started by allowing multinational corporations like Alcoa -

15
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:00,369
- to build giant aluminum-smelting plants -

16
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:05,374
- and exploit lceland's geothermal and hydroelectric energy sources.

17
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,752
Many of the most beautiful areas in the highlands -

18
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,465
- with the most spectacular colors are geothermal.

19
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,260
So nothing comes without consequence.

20
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,175
At the same time -

21
00:02:56,342 --> 00:03:00,012
- the government privatized Iceland's three largest banks.

22
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,681
The result was one of the purest experiments -

23
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,809
- in financial deregulation ever conducted.

24
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,484
We have had enough. How could all of this happen?

25
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:20,449
Finance took over and more or less wrecked the place.

26
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,161
In a five-year period, these three tiny banks -

27
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,788
- which had never operated outside of lceland -

28
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,875
- borrowed 1 20 billion dollars -

29
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,128
- 1 0 times the size of Iceland's economy.

30
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,547
The bankers showered money on themselves -

31
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,633
- each other, and their friends.

32
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,468
There was a massive bubble.

33
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,971
Stock prices went up by a factor of nine.

34
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,349
House prices more than doubled.

35
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:51,688
Iceland's bubble gave rise to people like Jon Asgeir Johannesson.

36
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:56,652
He borrowed billions to buy up high-end retail businesses in London.

37
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,029
He also bought a pinstriped private jet -

38
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,989
- a 40-million-dollar yacht -

39
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,242
- and a Manhattan penthouse.

40
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,244
Newspapers always had the headline:

41
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,455
This millionaire bought this company -

42
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:13,794
- in the U.K. or in Finland or in France or wherever -

43
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,254
- instead of saying:

44
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:19,174
"This millionaire took a billion-dollar loan -

45
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:23,679
- to buy this company, and he took it from your local bank."

46
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,847
The banks set up money market funds -

47
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:29,184
- and the banks advised deposit-holders to withdraw money -

48
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,603
- and put them in the money market funds.

49
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,189
The Ponzi scheme needed everything it could.

50
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,484
American accounting firms like KPMG -

51
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,112
- audited the Icelandic banks and investment firms -

52
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,072
- and found nothing wrong.

53
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,867
And American credit-rating agencies said lceland was wonderful.

54
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,160
In February 2007 -

55
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:54,710
- the rating agency upgraded the banks to the highest possible rate, triple-A.

56
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:59,756
It went so far as the government here traveling with the bankers -

57
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,801
- as a PR show.

58
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,598
When Iceland's banks collapsed at the end of 2008 -

59
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:12,060
- unemployment tripled in six months.

60
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,567
There is nobody unaffected in Iceland.

61
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,158
A lot of people lost their savings.

62
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,410
Yes, that's the case.

63
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,663
Government regulators who should've been protecting the citizens -

64
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,416
- had done nothing.

65
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,962
You have two lawyers from the regulator going down to a bank -

66
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,048
- to talk about some issue.

67
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,841
When they approach the bank -

68
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:48,305
- they would see 1 9 SUVs outside the bank.

69
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,639
You enter the bank -

70
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:54,019
- and you have the 1 9 lawyers sitting in front of you, right -

71
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:59,566
- very well prepared, ready to kill any argument you make.

72
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,819
And then, if you do really well, they'll offer you a job.

73
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,281
One-third of Iceland's financial regulators -

74
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,867
- went to work for the banks.

75
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,120
But this is a universal problem, huh?

76
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,998
In New York, you have the same problem, right?

77
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,032
What do you think of Wall Street incomes these days?

78
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,700
Excessive.

79
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:56,081
I've been told it's extremely difficult for the lMF -

80
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,291
- to criticize the United States.

81
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,584
I wouldn't say that.

82
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:10,178
We deeply regret our breaches of U.S. law.

83
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:17,853
They're amazed at how much cocaine these Wall Streeters can use -

84
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,188
- and get up and go to work the next day.

85
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:27,112
I didn't know what credit default swaps are.

86
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,905
I'm a little bit old-fashioned.

87
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,746
Has Larry Summers ever expressed remorse?

88
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,707
I don't hear confessions.

89
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,307
The government's just writing checks.

90
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,727
That's plan A, that's plan B and that's plan C.

91
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,772
Would you support legal controls on executive pay?

92
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,649
I would not.

93
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:12,073
Are you comfortable with the level of compensation in financial services?

94
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,742
If they've earned it, yes, I am.

95
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,952
-Do you think they've earned it? -l think so.

96
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:22,125
And so you've helped these people blow the world up?

97
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,335
You could say that.

98
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,598
They were having massive private gains at public loss.

99
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,318
When you think you can create something out of nothing -

100
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,945
- it's difficult to resist.

101
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,004
I'm concerned people want to go back to the old way -

102
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,840
- the way they were operating prior to the crisis.

103
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:25,021
I was getting a lot of anonymous e-mails from bankers saying:

104
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,983
"You can't quote me, but I'm really concerned."

105
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,699
Why do you think there isn't -

106
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,577
- a more systematic investigation being undertaken?

107
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,704
Because then you'll find the culprits.

108
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:48,628
You think Columbia Business School has any conflict-of-interest problem?

109
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,171
I don't see that we do.

110
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,642
The regulators didn't do their job.

111
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,730
They had the power to do every case that I made. They just didn't want to.

112
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,125
Lehman Brothers, one of the most venerable -

113
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,670
- and biggest investment banks, was forced to declare itself bankrupt.

114
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,923
Another, Merrill Lynch, was forced to sell itself today.

115
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:38,261
World financial markets are way down, following dramatic developments - .

116
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,812
In September 2008 -

117
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,982
- the bankruptcy of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers -

118
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,196
- and the collapse of the world's largest insurance company, AIG -

119
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,906
- triggered a global crisis.

120
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,241
Fears gripped markets overnight - .

121
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,910
Stocks fell off a cliff.

122
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,913
The largest single point drop in history.

123
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,082
Share prices continued to tumble -

124
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,418
- in the aftermath of the Lehman collapse.

125
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,506
The result was a global recession -

126
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,550
- which cost the world tens of trillions of dollars -

127
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,928
- rendered 30 million people unemployed -

128
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,390
- and doubled the national debt of the United States.

129
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,728
With the destruction of equity and housing wealth -

130
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,398
- the destruction of income, ofjobs -

131
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:36,986
- 50 million people globally could end up below the poverty line again.

132
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:41,700
This is just a hugely, hugely expensive crisis.

133
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,120
This crisis was not an accident.

134
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,498
It was caused by an out-of-control industry.

135
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,874
Since the 1 980s -

136
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:53,128
- the rise of the U.S. financial sector has led to a series -

137
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:56,423
- of increasingly severe financial crises.

138
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,634
Each crisis has caused more damage -

139
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,638
- while the industry has made more and more money.

140
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,314
After the Great Depression -

141
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:16,359
- the United States had 40 years of economic growth -

142
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,820
- without a single financial crisis.

143
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,865
The financial industry was tightly regulated.

144
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,409
Most regular banks were local businesses -

145
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,703
- prohibited from speculating -

146
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,788
- with depositors' savings.

147
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,208
lnvestment banks, which handled stock and bond trading -

148
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:35,086
- were small, private partnerships.

149
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,839
In the traditional investment banking model -

150
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,674
- the partners put the money up -

151
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,971
- and they watch that money very carefully.

152
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,598
They wanted to live well -

153
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,559
- but they didn't want to bet the ranch on anything.

154
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,353
Paul Volcker served in the Treasury Department -

155
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:57,442
- and was chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1 979 to 1 987.

156
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,235
Before going into government -

157
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:02,614
- he was a financial economist at Chase Manhattan Bank.

158
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,411
When I left Chase to go in the Treasury in 1 969 -

159
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,456
- my income was in the neighborhood of $45,000 a year.

160
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,541
Forty-five thousand dollars a year.

161
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,878
Morgan Stanley, in 1 972 -

162
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:21,716
- had approximately 1 1 0 total personnel -

163
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:26,262
- one office, and capital of 1 2 million dollars.

164
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,892
Now Morgan Stanley has 50,000 workers -

165
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,063
- and has capital of several billion -

166
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,816
- and has offices all over the world.

167
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,902
ln the 1 980s, the financial industry exploded.

168
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,654
The investment banks went public -

169
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,073
- giving them huge amounts of stockholder money.

170
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,285
People on Wall Street started getting rich.

171
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,373
I had a friend who was a bond trader -

172
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,503
- at Merrill Lynch in the 1 970s.

173
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,423
He had a job as a train conductor at night -

174
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:06,052
- because he had three kids and couldn't support them -

175
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,595
- on what a trader made.

176
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:11,432
By 1 986, he was making millions of dollars -

177
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,310
- and thought it was because he was smart.

178
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,647
The highest order of business before the nation -

179
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,191
- is to restore our economic prosperity.

180
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:24,863
In 1 981 , President Ronald Reagan chose as Treasury secretary -

181
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,533
- the CEO of the investment bank Merrill Lynch, Donald Regan.

182
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,785
Wall Street and the president see eye to eye.

183
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,622
I've talked to leaders of Wall Street.

184
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,542
They say, "We're behind the president 1 00 percent."

185
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,168
The Reagan administration -

186
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:42,130
- supported by economists and financial lobbyists -

187
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:46,217
- started a 30-year period of financial deregulation.

188
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,138
ln 1 982, the Reagan administration -

189
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,807
- deregulated savings-and-loan companies -

190
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:56,519
- allowing them to make risky investments with depositors' money.

191
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,146
By the end of the decade -

192
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,399
- hundreds of savings-and-loan companies had failed.

193
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:05,486
This crisis cost taxpayers $1 24 billion -

194
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,656
- and cost many people their life savings.

195
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:12,035
It may be the biggest bank heist in our history.

196
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:16,414
Thousands of executives went to jail for looting their companies.

197
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,167
One of the most extreme cases was Charles Keating.

198
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,668
Mr. Keating, got a word?

199
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:25,131
In 1 985, when federal regulators began investigating him -

200
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,927
- Keating hired an economist named Alan Greenspan.

201
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,762
In this letter to regulators -

202
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,515
- Greenspan praised Keating's sound business plans and expertise -

203
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:38,937
- and said he saw no risk in allowing Keating to invest customers' money.

204
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:44,817
Keating reportedly paid Greenspan $40,000.

205
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,863
Keating went to prison shortly afterwards.

206
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,698
As for Alan Greenspan -

207
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,953
- Reagan appointed him chairman of America's central bank -

208
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,704
- the Federal Reserve.

209
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,373
Greenspan was reappointed -

210
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,251
- by presidents Clinton and George W. Bush.

211
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,004
During the Clinton administration -

212
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,423
- deregulation continued under Greenspan -

213
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,176
- and Treasury secretaries Robert Rubin -

214
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,721
- the former CEO of the investment bank Goldman Sachs -

215
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:17,392
- and Larry Summers, a Harvard economics professor.

216
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,603
The financial sector, Wall Street being powerful -

217
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,730
- having lobbies, lots of money -

218
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:26,401
- step by step, captured the political system.

219
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,404
Both on the Democratic and the Republican side.

220
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,950
By the late 1 990s, the financial sector had consolidated -

221
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:37,620
- into a few gigantic firms, each of them so large -

222
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,832
- that their failure could threaten the whole system.

223
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,585
And the Clinton administration helped them grow even larger.

224
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,548
ln 1 998, Citicorp and Travelers merged -

225
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,091
- to form Citigroup -

226
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,094
- the largest financial services company in the world.

227
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,847
The merger violated the Glass-Steagall Act -

228
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,349
- a law passed after the Great Depression -

229
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,852
- preventing banks with consumer deposits -

230
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,272
- from engaging in risky investment-banking activities.

231
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,107
It was illegal to acquire Travelers.

232
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,193
Greenspan said nothing.

233
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,280
The Federal Reserve gave them an exemption for a year -

234
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,282
- then they got the law passed.

235
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:18,286
ln 1 999, at the urging of Summers and Rubin -

236
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,080
- Congress passed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act -

237
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:24,292
- known to some as the Citigroup Relief Act.

238
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,586
It overturned Glass-Steagall -

239
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,756
- and cleared the way for future mergers.

240
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,515
Why do you have big banks?

241
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:42,018
Because banks like monopoly power, lobbying power.

242
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:48,399
Because banks know that when they're too big -

243
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,817
- they will be bailed.

244
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,527
Markets are inherently unstable.

245
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,073
Or at least potentially unstable.

246
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,077
An appropriate metaphor is the oil tankers.

247
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,536
They are very big -

248
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,581
- and therefore, you have to put in compartments -

249
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,251
- to prevent the sloshing around of oil -

250
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,253
- from capsizing the boat.

251
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,757
The design of the boat has to take that into account.

252
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,885
And after the Depression -

253
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:21,766
- the regulations actually introduced these very watertight compartments.

254
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:28,231
And deregulation has led to the end of compartmentalization.

255
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:31,275
The next crisis came at the end of the '90s.

256
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,738
The investment banks fueled a massive bubble in lnternet stocks -

257
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,616
- which was followed by a crash in 2001  -

258
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,702
- that caused $5 trillion in investment losses.

259
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:45,456
The Securities and Exchange Commission, the federal agency -

260
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:49,085
- created during the Depression to regulate investment banking -

261
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,920
- had done nothing.

262
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,715
In the absence of meaningful federal action -

263
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,426
- and given the clear failure of self-regulation -

264
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,138
- it's become necessary for others to step in -

265
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,223
- and adopt the protections needed.

266
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,226
Eliot Spitzer's investigation revealed the investment banks -

267
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,147
- promoted Internet companies they knew would fail.

268
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,900
Analysts were being paid based on how much business they brought in.

269
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:17,405
What they said publicly was quite different from what they said privately.

270
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,032
Infospace, given the highest possible rating -

271
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,743
- dismissed by an analyst as a "piece ofjunk."

272
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:26,956
Excite, also highly rated, called "such a piece of crap."

273
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,543
The defense that was proffered by many of the investment banks -

274
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,382
- was not "you're wrong" -

275
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:40,011
- it was, "Everybody's doing it, everybody knows it's going on.

276
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,305
Nobody should rely on these analysts anyway."

277
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,807
ln December, 2002 -

278
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:49,520
- 1 0 investment banks settled the case for a total of $1 .4 billion -

279
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,440
- and promised to change their ways.

280
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:56,694
Scott Talbott is the chief lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable -

281
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,280
- one of Washington's most powerful groups -

282
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:03,284
- which represents nearly all of the world's largest financial companies.

283
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:07,371
Are you comfortable with the fact that several of your member companies -

284
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,541
- have engaged in large-scale criminal activity?

285
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,793
-l-- You'll have to be specific. -Okay.

286
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:16,797
And first of all, criminal activity shouldn't be accepted, period.

287
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,643
Since deregulation began, the world's biggest financial firms -

288
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,021
- have been caught laundering money, defrauding customers -

289
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:36,150
- and cooking their books again and again and again.

290
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,665
Credit Suisse helped funnel money for Iran's nuclear program -

291
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,334
- and for lran's Aerospace Industries Organization -

292
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,253
- which builds ballistic missiles.

293
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,674
Any information that would identify it as lranian would be removed.

294
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:02,885
The bank was fined $536 million.

295
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:07,014
Citibank helped funnel $1 00 million of drug money out of Mexico.

296
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,725
Did you comment that she should, quote:

297
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,728
"Lose any documents connected with the account"?

298
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,438
I said that in a kidding manner.

299
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,900
I did not mean it seriously.

300
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,072
Between 1 998 and 2003 -

301
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,575
- Fannie Mae overstated its earnings by more than $1 0 billion.

302
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,869
These accounting standards are complex -

303
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:32,873
- and require determinations over which experts often disagree.

304
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:37,211
CEO Franklin Raines, who used to be President Clinton's budget director -

305
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,381
- received over $52 million in bonuses.

306
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,472
When UBS was caught helping wealthy Americans evade taxes -

307
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,183
- they refused to cooperate with the government.

308
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,644
Would you be willing to supply the names?

309
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:57,273
-lf there's a treaty framework. -No treaty framework.

310
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,026
You've agreed you participated in a fraud.

311
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,581
But while the companies face unprecedented fines -

312
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:17,585
- the investment firms do not have to admit any wrongdoing.

313
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,964
When dealing with this many products, this many customers, mistakes happen.

314
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:26,969
The financial services industry seems to have a level of criminality -

315
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,096
- that is somewhat distinctive.

316
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:32,975
You know, when was the last time that Cisco -

317
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:37,271
- or lntel or Google or Apple or IBM, you know--?

318
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,149
I agree about high-tech versus financial services--

319
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,736
-So how come? -High-tech is a creative business -

320
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,780
- where the value generation -

321
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:49,116
- and income derives from actually creating something new.

322
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,869
Beginning in the 1 990s -

323
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,747
- deregulation and advances in technology -

324
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:59,085
- led to an explosion of complex financial products called derivatives.

325
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:02,671
Economists and bankers claimed they made markets safer.

326
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:06,300
But instead, they made them unstable.

327
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,803
Since the end of the Cold War -

328
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,972
- a lot of former physicists, mathematicians -

329
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,308
- decided to apply their skills -

330
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,186
- not on, you know, Cold War technology -

331
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,230
- but on financial markets.

332
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,524
And together with investment bankers--

333
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,901
-Creating different weapons. -Absolutely.

334
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:27,321
You know, as Warren Buffett said, weapons of mass destruction.

335
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,490
Regulators, politicians, business people -

336
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,995
- did not take seriously the threat of innovation -

337
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,498
- on the stability of the financial system.

338
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,375
Using derivatives -

339
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,336
- bankers could gamble on virtually anything.

340
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,172
They could bet on the rise or fall of oil prices -

341
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,217
- the bankruptcy of a company, even the weather.

342
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,678
By the late 1 990s -

343
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:55,850
- derivatives were a 50-trillion-dollar unregulated market.

344
00:23:56,184 --> 00:24:00,729
ln 1 998, someone tried to regulate them.

345
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:04,817
Brooksley Born graduated first in her class at Stanford Law School -

346
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:08,320
- and was the first woman to edit a major law review.

347
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,615
After running the derivatives practice at Arnold & Porter -

348
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,659
- Born was appointed by Clinton -

349
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,704
- to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission -

350
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,457
- which oversaw the derivatives market.

351
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:23,210
Brooksley Born asked me if l would come work with her.

352
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:31,051
We decided that this was a serious, potentially destabilizing market.

353
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:36,640
In May of 1 998, the CFTC issued a proposal to regulate derivatives.

354
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:40,019
Clinton's Treasury Department had an immediate response.

355
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:44,732
I happened to go into Brooksley's office -

356
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,944
- and she was just putting down the receiver on her telephone -

357
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:52,865
- and the blood had drained from her face.

358
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:56,410
And she looked at me and said, "That was Larry Summers."

359
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,747
He had 1 3 bankers in his office.

360
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:03,918
He conveyed it in a very bullying fashion -

361
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:07,379
- sort of directing her to stop.

362
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:10,633
Banks were now reliant for earnings on these activities.

363
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:17,848
And that led to a titanic battle to prevent this from being regulated.

364
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,392
Shortly after the phone call from Summers -

365
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,772
- Greenspan, Rubin, and SEC chairman Arthur Levitt -

366
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,358
- issued a joint statement condemning Born -

367
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,611
- and recommending legislation to keep derivatives unregulated.

368
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,449
Regulation of derivatives transactions -

369
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:39,286
- that are privately negotiated by professionals is unnecessary.

370
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:45,292
She was overruled, unfortunately. First by the Clinton administration -

371
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,127
- and then by the Congress.

372
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:51,298
In 2000, Senator Phil Gramm took a major role in getting a bill passed -

373
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:54,552
- that pretty much exempted derivatives from regulation.

374
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,263
They are unifying markets, reducing regulatory burden.

375
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,391
I believe we need to do it.

376
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,025
It is our very great hope -

377
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,405
- that it will be possible to move this year -

378
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,658
- on legislation that, in a suitable way -

379
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:24,498
- goes to create legal certainty for OTC derivatives.

380
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,381
I wish to associate myself -

381
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,051
- with all the remarks of Secretary Summers.

382
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:39,305
ln December of 2000, Congress passed -

383
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:42,266
- the Commodity Futures Modernization Act.

384
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,352
Written with the help of financial-industry lobbyists -

385
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,980
- it banned the regulation of derivatives.

386
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,233
After that, it was off to the races.

387
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,363
Use of derivatives and financial innovation -

388
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,866
- exploded dramatically after 2000.

389
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,659
-So help me God. -So help me God.

390
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:05,414
By the time George W. Bush took office in 2001  -

391
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,626
- the U.S. financial sector was vastly more profitable -

392
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:12,588
- concentrated and powerful than ever before.

393
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:16,634
Dominating this industry were five investment banks -

394
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,053
- two financial conglomerates -

395
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,889
- three securities insurance companies -

396
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,391
- and three rating agencies.

397
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:28,479
And linking them all together was the securitization food chain.

398
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,523
A new system which connected trillions of dollars -

399
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:36,195
- in mortgages and other loans with investors all over the world.

400
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,031
Thirty years ago, if you went to get a loan for a home -

401
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,910
- the person lending you the money expected you to pay him or her back.

402
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,996
You got a loan from a lender who wanted to be paid back.

403
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:50,000
We've since developed securitization, whereby people who make the loan -

404
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,586
- are no longer at risk if they fail to repay.

405
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:56,965
In the old system, when a homeowner paid their mortgage every month -

406
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,593
- the money went to their local lender.

407
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:03,514
And since mortgages took decades to repay, lenders were careful.

408
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,769
In the new system, lenders sold mortgages to investment banks.

409
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:13,148
The banks combined thousands of mortgages and loans -

410
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:17,403
- including car loans, student loans, and credit card debt -

411
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:21,740
- to create complex derivatives called collateralized debt obligations -

412
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,617
- or CDOs.

413
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:28,664
The investment banks then sold the CDOs to investors.

414
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,125
Now when homeowners paid their mortgages -

415
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:34,420
- the money went to investors all over the world.

416
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,131
The investment banks paid rating agencies -

417
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:39,007
- to evaluate the CDOs -

418
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,844
- and many of them were given a triple-A rating -

419
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,638
- which is the highest possible investment grade.

420
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,850
This made CDOs popular with retirement funds -

421
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:51,812
- which could only purchase highly rated securities.

422
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:56,316
This system was a ticking time bomb.

423
00:28:56,484 --> 00:29:00,154
Lenders didn't care anymore about whether a borrower could repay -

424
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,990
- so they started making riskier loans.

425
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,325
The investment banks didn't care either.

426
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:09,246
The more CDOs they sold, the higher their profits.

427
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:13,000
And the rating agencies, which were paid by the investment banks -

428
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:17,045
- had no liability if their ratings of CDOs proved wrong.

429
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:23,010
You weren't gonna be on the hook, there weren't regulatory constraints.

430
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:26,346
So it was a green light to just pump out more and more loans.

431
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,683
Between 2000 and 2003 -

432
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:34,605
- the number of mortgage loans made each year nearly quadrupled.

433
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,691
Everybody in this securitization food chain -

434
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,194
- from the very beginning until the end -

435
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,863
- didn't care about the quality of the mortgage.

436
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,574
They were caring about maximizing their volume -

437
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,534
- and getting a fee out of it.

438
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,203
In the early 2000s -

439
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:54,082
- there was a huge increase in the riskiest loans, called subprime.

440
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:58,837
When thousands of subprime loans were combined to create CDOs -

441
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:02,633
- many of them still received triple-A ratings.

442
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:09,348
Now, it would have been possible to create derivative products -

443
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,725
- that don't have these risks -

444
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,311
- that carry the equivalent of deductibles -

445
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:19,274
- where there are limits on the risks that can be taken on, and so forth.

446
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,902
-They didn't do that, did they? -They didn't.

447
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,904
In retrospect, they should've done.

448
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,865
So did these guys know they were doing something dangerous?

449
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,325
I think they did.

450
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:51,098
All the incentives financial institutions offered to their mortgage brokers -

451
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,893
- were based on selling the most profitable products -

452
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,645
- which were predatory loans.

453
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,775
If they make more money, that's where they'll put you.

454
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:10,033
Suddenly, hundreds of billions of dollars a year -

455
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,995
- were flowing through the securitization chain.

456
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:15,038
Since anyone could get a mortgage -

457
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,250
- home purchases and housing prices skyrocketed.

458
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:22,880
The result was the biggest financial bubble in history.

459
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,465
Real estate is real. They can see their asset.

460
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:28,802
They can live in their asset. They can rent out their asset.

461
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,180
You had a huge boom in housing that made no sense at all.

462
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:39,062
The financing appetites of the financial sector -

463
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,149
- drove what everybody else did.

464
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:46,194
Last time we had a housing bubble was in the late '80s.

465
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:51,491
In that case, the increase in home price had been relatively minor.

466
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,828
That housing bubble led to a relatively severe recession.

467
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:00,834
From 1 996 until 2006 -

468
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,837
- real home prices effectively doubled.

469
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,221
At $500 a ticket, they've come to hear how to buy their very own piece -

470
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,599
- of the American dream.

471
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:19,937
Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers -

472
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,898
- Merrill Lynch were all in on this.

473
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:28,946
The subprime lending alone increased from 30 billion a year in funding -

474
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:33,033
- to over 600 billion a year in 1 0 years.

475
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,743
They knew what was happening.

476
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,497
Countrywide Financial, the largest subprime lender -

477
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:42,709
- issued $97 billion worth of loans.

478
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:46,088
lt made over $1 1 billion in profits as a result.

479
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,510
On Wall Street, annual cash bonuses spiked.

480
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,178
Traders and CEOs -

481
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:56,056
- became enormously wealthy during the bubble.

482
00:32:56,224 --> 00:33:00,185
Lehman Brothers was a top underwriter of subprime lending -

483
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,562
- and their CEO, Richard Fuld -

484
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:06,650
- took home $485 million.

485
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:10,070
On Wall Street, this housing and credit bubble -

486
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:13,782
- was leading to hundreds of billions of dollars of profits.

487
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,411
You know, by 2006 about 40 percent of all profits -

488
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:21,665
- of S&P 500 firms was coming from financial institutions.

489
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,417
It wasn't real profits or income.

490
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,047
It was money created by the system and booked as income.

491
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:32,801
Two, three years down the road there's a default, it's all wiped out.

492
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:36,930
I think it was, in fact, in retrospect, a great big national--

493
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,766
And not just national, global Ponzi scheme.

494
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,395
Through the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act -

495
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,231
- the Federal Reserve board had broad authority -

496
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,358
- to regulate the mortgage industry.

497
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:52,154
But Fed chairman Alan Greenspan refused to use it.

498
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,865
Alan Greenspan said, "No, that's regulation.

499
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,366
I don't believe in it."

500
00:33:56,534 --> 00:34:00,370
For 20 years, Robert Gnaizda was the head of Greenlining -

501
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,956
- a powerful consumer advocacy group.

502
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,917
He met with Greenspan on a regular basis.

503
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:08,545
We gave him an example of Countrywide -

504
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:13,800
- and 1 50 different complex adjustable-rate mortgages.

505
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,803
He said, "If you had a doctorate in math -

506
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,639
- you wouldn't be able to understand them enough -

507
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:23,143
- to know which was good for you and which wasn't."

508
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,396
So we thought he was gonna take action.

509
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,815
But as the conversation continued -

510
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:31,818
- it was clear he was stuck with his ideology.

511
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:35,072
We met again with Greenspan in '05.

512
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:39,159
Often we met with him twice a year, and never less than once a year.

513
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,495
And he wouldn't change his mind.

514
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,253
In this world of global communications -

515
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,464
- the efficient movement of capital -

516
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:56,343
- is helping to create the greatest prosperity in human history.

517
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:06,561
A hundred and forty-six people were cut from the SEC Enforcement Division?

518
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,688
Is that what you also testified to?

519
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:09,856
Yes.

520
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,654
Yeah, l think there has been a systematic gutting -

521
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,406
- or whatever you wanna call it, of the agency -

522
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:21,701
- and its capability through cutting back of staff.

523
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,579
The SEC Office of Risk Management -

524
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:28,708
- was reduced to a staff, did you say, of one?

525
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:33,046
Yeah. When that gentleman would go home, he could turn the lights out.

526
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:38,218
During the bubble, investment banks were borrowing heavily -

527
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:42,180
- to buy more loans and create more CDOs.

528
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:46,101
The ratio between borrowed money and the banks' own money -

529
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,477
- was called leverage.

530
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:52,482
The more the banks borrowed, the higher their leverage.

531
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:58,238
In 2004, Henry Paulson, the CEO of Goldman Sachs -

532
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:02,909
- helped lobby the SEC to relax limits on leverage -

533
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:06,913
- allowing the banks to sharply increase their borrowing.

534
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,373
The SEC somehow decided -

535
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:13,170
- to let investment banks gamble a lot more.

536
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,464
That was nuts. l don't know why they did that, but they did.

537
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,891
We've said these are the big guys, and clearly that's true.

538
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:32,272
But that means if anything goes wrong, it's going to be an awfully big mess.

539
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,945
You are dealing with the most highly sophisticated financial institutions.

540
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:42,282
These are the firms that do most of the derivative activity.

541
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:46,536
We talked to some as to what their comfort level was.

542
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:51,708
The firms actually thought that the number was appropriate.

543
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:55,003
The commissioners vote to adopt the new rules as recommended.

544
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,547
Yes.

545
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:01,635
We do indeed. It's unanimous. And we are adjourned.

546
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,807
The degree of leverage in the financial system -

547
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,477
- became absolutely frightening.

548
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,148
Investment banks leveraging up to the level of 33-to-1 .

549
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,984
Which means that a tiny 3-percent decrease -

550
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:21,488
- in the value of their asset base would leave them insolvent.

551
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:27,077
There was another ticking time bomb in the financial system.

552
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,497
AlG, the world's largest insurance company -

553
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,166
- was selling huge quantities of derivatives -

554
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,168
- called credit default swaps.

555
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:39,339
For investors who owned CDOs -

556
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:43,009
- credit default swaps worked like an insurance policy.

557
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,845
An investor who purchased a credit default swap -

558
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:49,015
- paid AlG a quarterly premium.

559
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,934
lf the CDO went bad -

560
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:55,230
- AIG promised to pay the investor for their losses.

561
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,191
But unlike regular insurance -

562
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,987
- speculators could also buy credit default swaps from AIG -

563
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:05,740
- in order to bet against CDOs they didn't own.

564
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,327
In insurance, you can only insure something you own.

565
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:12,539
Let's say you and l own property. I own a house.

566
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,083
I can only insure that house once.

567
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:18,211
The derivatives universe essentially enables anybody -

568
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,338
- to actually insure that house.

569
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,841
You could insure that, somebody else could.

570
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,051
So 50 people might insure my house.

571
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,971
So what happens is, if my house burns down -

572
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,975
- the number of losses in the system becomes proportionately larger.

573
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,312
Since credit default swaps were unregulated -

574
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:39,816
- AIG didn't have to put aside any money to cover potential losses.

575
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:44,070
Instead, AIG paid its employees huge cash bonuses -

576
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,573
- as soon as contracts were signed.

577
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,242
But if the CDOs later went bad -

578
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,037
- AlG would be on the hook.

579
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:56,374
People were essentially being rewarded for taking massive risks.

580
00:38:56,542 --> 00:39:00,378
In good times, they generate short-term revenues and profits -

581
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,963
- and, therefore, bonuses.

582
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:05,508
But that's gonna lead to the firm to be bankrupt over time.

583
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,178
That's a distorted system of compensation.

584
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:11,931
AlG's Financial Products division in London -

585
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:16,478
- issued $500 billion worth of credit default swaps during the bubble -

586
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:21,649
- many of them for CDOs backed by subprime mortgages.

587
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:24,277
The 400 employees at AlGFP -

588
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:28,448
- made $3.5 billion between 2000 and 2007.

589
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:31,951
Joseph Cassano, the head of AlGFP -

590
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,330
- personally made $31 5 million.

591
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,581
lt's hard for us -

592
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,753
- and without being flippant, to even see a scenario -

593
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,214
- within any kind of realm of reason -

594
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:49,302
- that would see us losing one dollar in any of those transactions.

595
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:53,807
ln 2007, AlG's auditors raised warnings.

596
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:56,059
One of them, Joseph St. Denis -

597
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:59,854
- resigned in protest after Cassano repeatedly blocked him -

598
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:02,982
- from investigating AlGFP's accounting.

599
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,567
One person didn't get a bonus.

600
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:11,241
That was St. Denis. Mr. St. Denis tried to alert the two of you -

601
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,077
- to the fact you were running into big problems.

602
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,872
He quit in frustration, and he didn't get a bonus.

603
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:21,000
In 2005, Raghuram Rajan -

604
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:24,671
- then the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund -

605
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,507
- delivered a paper at the Jackson Hole symposium -

606
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,343
- the most elite banking conference in the world.

607
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,803
Who was in the audience?

608
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,016
It was the central bankers of the world -

609
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:40,520
- ranging from Mr. Greenspan himself -

610
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,896
- Ben Bernanke -

611
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,189
- Larry Summers.

612
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,358
Tim Geithner was there.

613
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,485
The title of the paper was essentially:

614
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:51,364
"Is Financial Development Making the World Riskier?"

615
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:54,909
And the conclusion was, it is.

616
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,706
Rajan's paper focused on incentive structures -

617
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:04,085
- that generated huge cash bonuses based on short-term profits -

618
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:07,547
- but which imposed no penalties for later losses.

619
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,633
Rajan argued that these incentives encouraged bankers -

620
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:14,387
- to take risks that might eventually destroy their own firms -

621
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,807
- or even the entire financial system.

622
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:24,606
It's very easy to generate performance by taking on more risk.

623
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:29,319
So what you need to do is compensate for risk-adjusted performance.

624
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,738
And that's where all the bodies are buried.

625
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:35,074
Rajan, you know, hit the nail on the head.

626
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,243
What he particularly said was:

627
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,787
"You guys have claimed you've found a way -

628
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:42,415
- to make more profits with less risk.

629
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,793
I say you've found a way to make more profits with more risk.

630
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,337
There's a big difference."

631
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,089
Summers was vocal.

632
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,634
He basically thought -

633
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:58,097
- that l was criticizing the change in the financial world -

634
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:01,559
- and was worried about, you know, regulation -

635
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,770
- which would reverse this change.

636
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,314
Essentially he accused me of being a Luddite.

637
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:10,944
He wanted to make sure that we didn't bring in -

638
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,946
- a whole new set of regulations -

639
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:15,615
- to constrain the financial sector.

640
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:23,831
You're gonna make an extra $2 million a year, or $1 0 million a year -

641
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:26,626
- for putting your financial institution at risk.

642
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,920
Someone else pays the bill, you don't.

643
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,505
Would you make that bet?

644
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:33,841
Most people on Wall Street said, "Sure, I'd make that bet."

645
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,761
It never was enough.

646
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:22,181
They don't wanna own one home, they wanna own five homes.

647
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:25,184
And they wanna have an expensive penthouse -

648
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,478
- on Park Avenue.

649
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,898
And they wanna have their own private jet.

650
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:33,943
You think this is an industry where high--?

651
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,362
Very high compensation levels are justified?

652
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:39,198
I think I would take caution, or take heed -

653
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:42,577
- or take exception to your word "very high." lt's relative.

654
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,121
You have a 14-million-dollar home in Florida.

655
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,373
You have a summer home in Sun Valley, ldaho.

656
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:51,794
An art collection filled with million-dollar paintings.

657
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,589
Richard Fuld never appeared on the trading floor.

658
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:57,050
There were art advisors there all the time.

659
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,426
He had a private elevator.

660
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,554
He wanted to be disconnected.

661
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,557
His elevator, they hired technicians to program it -

662
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,518
- so that his driver would call in in the morning -

663
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:09,812
- and a security guard would hold it.

664
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:14,442
There's only a three-second window where he actually has to see people.

665
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,654
And he hops into this elevator and it goes straight to 31 .

666
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,447
Lehman owned corporate jets.

667
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:22,325
-You know about this? -Yes.

668
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,660
How many were there?

669
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,496
Well, there were six, including the 767s.

670
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,414
They also had a helicopter.

671
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:31,084
Isn't that kind of a lot of planes to have?

672
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,922
We're dealing with type-A personalities.

673
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:40,885
Banking became a pissing contest.

674
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:43,304
"Mine's bigger than yours." That kind of stuff.

675
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:45,640
It was all men that ran it, incidentally.

676
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:49,811
Fifty-billion-dollar deals weren't big enough, so we'd do 1 00-billion deals.

677
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:52,814
These people are risk-takers. They're impulsive.

678
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:01,447
It's part of their behavior. It's part of their personality.

679
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:04,659
And that manifests outside of work as well.

680
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:07,370
It was quite typical for the guys to go out -

681
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,539
- to go to strip bars, to use drugs.

682
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,500
I see a lot of cocaine use, use of prostitution.

683
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,968
Recently, neuroscientists have done experiments -

684
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:27,098
- where they've taken individuals and put them into an MRl machine -

685
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:31,519
- and they have them play a game where the prize is money.

686
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:35,314
And they noticed that when the subjects earn money -

687
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,775
- the part of the brain that gets stimulated -

688
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:40,319
- is the same part that cocaine stimulates.

689
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:44,157
A lot of people feel that they need to participate in that behavior -

690
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:46,743
- to make it, to get promoted, get recognized.

691
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,996
According to a Bloomberg article, business entertainment -

692
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:53,499
- represents 5 percent of revenue for derivatives brokers -

693
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:58,004
- and often includes strip clubs, prostitution and drugs.

694
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:01,841
A New York broker filed a lawsuit in 2007 against his firm -

695
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:07,180
- alleging he was required to retain prostitutes to entertain traders.

696
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,223
There's just a blatant disregard -

697
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:14,061
- for the impact that their actions might have on society, on family.

698
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:17,482
They have no problem using a prostitute -

699
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,859
- and going home to their wife.

700
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,787
How many customers?

701
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,247
About 1 0,000 at that point in time.

702
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:39,545
What fraction were from Wall Street?

703
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:44,217
Of the higher-end clients, probably 40 to 50 percent.

704
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,969
Were all the major Wall Street firms represented?

705
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:51,098
-Goldman Sachs? -Lehman Brothers. They're all in there.

706
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:55,061
Morgan Stanley was a little less of that.

707
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:58,272
I think Goldman was pretty, pretty big with that.

708
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,024
Clients would call and say:

709
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,944
"Can you get me a Lamborghini for the girl?"

710
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:05,404
These guys were spending corporate money.

711
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:09,951
I had many black cards from, you know, the various financial firms.

712
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:13,913
What's happening is services are being charged -

713
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,790
- to computer repair.

714
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:20,294
Trading research, you know, consulting for market compliance.

715
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:23,756
Just gave them letterhead and said, "Make your own invoice."

716
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:27,093
This behavior extends to the senior management of the firm?

717
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,886
Absolutely does. Yeah.

718
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:31,138
I know for a fact that it does.

719
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:34,100
It extends to the very top.

720
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,982
A friend of mine in a company that has a big financial presence said:

721
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,862
"It's about time you learned about subprime mortgages."

722
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:49,782
So he set up a session with his trading desk and me.

723
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,828
And the techie who did all this gets very excited -

724
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:57,498
- runs to his computer, pulls up in about three seconds -

725
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:00,710
- this Goldman Sachs issue of securities.

726
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,295
It was a complete disaster.

727
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:08,050
Borrowers had borrowed, on average, 99.3 percent of the price of the house.

728
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,136
They have no money in the house.

729
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:13,514
If anything goes wrong, they walk away from the mortgage.

730
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:16,475
This is not a loan you'd really make, right?

731
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,060
You've gotta be crazy.

732
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:21,355
But somehow, you took 8000 of these loans -

733
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:23,733
- and by the time the guys were done -

734
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,694
- at Goldman Sachs and the rating agencies -

735
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:29,322
- two-thirds of the loans were rated triple-A.

736
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:32,325
They were rated as safe as government securities.

737
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,035
It's utterly mad.

738
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:38,497
Goldman Sachs sold at least $3.1 billion worth -

739
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:42,418
- of these toxic CDOs in the first half of 2006.

740
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:46,756
The CEO of Goldman Sachs at this time was Henry Paulson -

741
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,425
- the highest paid CEO on Wall Street.

742
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:54,347
Good morning. I'm pleased to announce -

743
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:58,351
- that l will nominate Henry Paulson to be the Secretary of the Treasury.

744
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:00,269
He has a lifetime of experience.

745
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,605
He has knowledge of financial markets.

746
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,691
He's earned a reputation for candor and integrity.

747
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,027
You might think it would be hard -

748
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,780
- to adjust to a meager government salary.

749
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,199
But taking the job as Treasury secretary -

750
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:16,369
- was the best financial decision of his life.

751
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:20,873
Paulson had to sell his $485 million of Goldman stock -

752
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,209
- when he went to work for the government.

753
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:26,379
But because of a law passed by the first President Bush -

754
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:28,714
- he didn't have to pay any taxes on it.

755
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:31,926
It saved him $50 million.

756
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:42,353
The article came out in October of 2007.

757
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:46,232
Already, a third of the mortgages defaulted.

758
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,818
Now most of them are going.

759
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:54,281
One group that had purchased these now worthless securities -

760
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:57,952
- was the Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi -

761
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,664
- which provides monthly benefits to over 80,000 retirees.

762
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:07,420
They lost millions of dollars and are now suing Goldman Sachs.

763
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:25,730
By late 2006, Goldman had taken things a step further.

764
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:28,399
It didn't just sell toxic CDOs -

765
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:32,737
- it started betting against them at the same time it was telling customers -

766
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:35,614
- that they were high-quality investments.

767
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:39,785
By purchasing credit default swaps from AlG -

768
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:42,955
- Goldman could bet against CDOs it didn't own -

769
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:46,333
- and get paid when the CDOs failed.

770
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:51,505
I asked if anybody called the customers and said:

771
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:54,467
"We don't really like this kind of mortgage anymore -

772
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:56,802
- and we thought you ought to know."

773
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:01,515
They didn't say anything, but you could feel the laughter over the phone.

774
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,644
Goldman Sachs bought at least $22 billion -

775
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:08,439
- of credit default swaps from AIG.

776
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:13,486
lt was so much that Goldman realized that AlG itself might go bankrupt.

777
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:16,655
So they spent $1 50 million insuring themselves -

778
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:19,617
- against AIG's potential collapse.

779
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:23,370
Then in 2007, Goldman went even further.

780
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:26,248
They started selling CDOs specifically designed -

781
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,959
- so that the more money their customers lost -

782
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,420
- the more money Goldman Sachs made.

783
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:41,597
Six hundred million dollars of Timberwolf securities is what you sold.

784
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,768
Before you sold them -

785
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:49,271
- this is what your sales team were telling to each other:

786
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:53,776
"Boy, that Timberwolf was one shitty deal."

787
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:57,029
This was an e-mail to me in late June, after the transaction.

788
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,535
No, no. You sold Timberwolf after as well.

789
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,912
-We did trades after that. -Yeah. Okay.

790
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:08,415
The next e-mail-- Take a look. July 1 , '07.

791
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:11,752
--tells the sales force, "The top priority is Timberwolf."

792
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:15,381
Your top priority to sell is that shitty deal.

793
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,800
If you have an adverse interest to your client -

794
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,802
- do you have the duty to disclose it?

795
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,304
To tell that client of your adverse interest?

796
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,974
-That's my question. -l'm trying to understand--

797
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,643
I think you understand. You don't wanna answer.

798
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,353
Do you believe you have a duty -

799
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,066
- to act in your clients' best interest?

800
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,281
I repeat, we have a duty to serve our clients -

801
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:44,910
- by showing prices on transactions that they ask us to show prices for.

802
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:47,872
What do you think about selling securities -

803
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:51,167
- which your own people think are crap?

804
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,085
Does that bother you?

805
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,920
I think they would - .

806
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:58,507
-As a hypothetical? -No, this is real.

807
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:01,093
-Well, then I don't know-- -We heard it today.

808
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:04,305
We heard it today. "This is a shitty deal." "This is crap."

809
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:06,515
I heard nothing today -

810
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:10,436
- that makes me think anything went wrong.

811
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:14,690
Is there not a conflict when you sell something to somebody -

812
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:20,279
- and then are determined to bet against that same security -

813
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:24,033
- and you don't disclose that to the person you're selling it to?

814
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,242
You see a problem?

815
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:28,495
In the context of market making, that is not a conflict.

816
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:35,502
When you heard your employees in e-mails said, "What a shitty deal" -

817
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,046
- did you feel anything?

818
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,548
That's very unfortunate to have on e-mail.

819
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,008
Are you embar--?

820
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:44,053
And very unfortunate-- I don't-- I don't--

821
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,972
"On e-mail"? How about feeling that way?

822
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,517
It's very unfortunate for anyone to have said that in any form.

823
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:55,731
Are your competitors engaged in similar activities?

824
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:59,693
Yes, and to a greater extent than us in most cases.

825
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:03,530
Hedge fund manager John Paulson made $1 2 billion -

826
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:05,741
- betting against the mortgage market.

827
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:09,119
When Paulson ran out of mortgage securities to bet against -

828
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:13,749
- he worked with Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank to create more.

829
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,751
Morgan Stanley was also selling -

830
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:19,672
- mortgage securities it was betting against, and it's now being sued by -

831
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:23,342
- the Government Employees' Retirement Fund of the Virgin Islands -

832
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,718
- for fraud.

833
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:27,346
The lawsuit alleges that Morgan Stanley knew -

834
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,139
- that the CDOs were junk.

835
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:31,225
Although they were rated triple-A -

836
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:34,019
- Morgan Stanley was betting they would fail.

837
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:38,399
A year later, Morgan Stanley had made hundreds of millions of dollars -

838
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:42,528
- while the investors had lost almost all of their money.

839
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:01,297
You would have thought pension funds would have said:

840
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:05,009
"Those are subprime. Why am l buying them?"

841
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,721
They had these guys at Moody's and Standard & Poor's -

842
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:10,597
- who said, "That's a triple-A."

843
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:16,812
No securities got issued without the seal of approval of the rating agencies.

844
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:21,734
The three rating agencies, Moody's, S&P and Fitch -

845
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:25,571
- made billions of dollars giving high ratings to risky securities.

846
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:30,200
Moody's, the largest rating agency, quadrupled its profits -

847
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:33,620
- between 2000 and 2007.

848
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:37,624
Moody's and S&P get compensated based on putting out ratings reports.

849
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:41,420
And the more structured securities they gave a triple-A rating to -

850
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,422
- the higher their earnings were.

851
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,382
Imagine going to The Times saying:

852
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,968
"Write a positive story, I'll pay you $500,000.

853
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:50,095
If you don't, l'll give you nothing."

854
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:52,765
Rating agencies could have stopped the party and said:

855
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:54,975
"Sorry. We're gonna tighten our standards" -

856
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:01,023
- and immediately cut off the funding to risky borrowers.

857
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,609
Triple-A-rated instruments -

858
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:11,033
- mushroomed from just a handful to thousands and thousands.

859
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:15,621
Hundreds of billions of dollars were being rated, you know, and--

860
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:17,664
-Per year? -Per year. Oh, yeah.

861
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:20,918
I've now testified before both houses of Congress -

862
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:24,338
- on the credit rating agency issue -

863
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:28,967
- and both times they trot out very prominent First Amendment lawyers -

864
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:33,305
- and argue that, "When we say something is rated triple-A -

865
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:37,142
- that is merely our 'opinion.' You shouldn't rely on it."

866
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,478
S&P's ratings express our opinion.

867
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:42,856
Our ratings are our opinions. They're opinions.

868
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,317
Opinions. And they are just opinions.

869
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:49,905
I think we are emphasizing the fact that our ratings are opinions.

870
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:58,997
They do not speak to the market value of a security -

871
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:03,710
- the volatility of its price, or its suitability as an investment.

872
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,107
We have many economists saying:

873
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,276
"This is a bubble, it's going to burst.

874
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,862
This is going to be an issue for the economy."

875
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:32,865
Some say it could even cause a recession at some point.

876
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:36,994
What is the worst-case scenario if, in fact, we were to see prices -

877
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:39,913
- come down substantially across the country?

878
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:43,208
I don't buy your premise. It's an unlikely possibility.

879
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:47,754
We've never had a decline in house prices on a nationwide basis.

880
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:52,426
Ben Bernanke became chairman of the Federal Reserve in February 2006 -

881
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,470
- the top year for subprime lending.

882
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,098
But despite numerous warnings -

883
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:01,393
- Bernanke and the Federal Reserve Board did nothing.

884
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:09,359
Robert Gnaizda met with Bernanke and the Federal Reserve Board -

885
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:12,654
- three times after Bernanke became chairman.

886
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:17,784
Only at the last meeting did he suggest that there was a problem -

887
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:20,245
- and that the government ought to look into it.

888
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:22,247
When? When was that? What year?

889
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:25,542
It's 2009, March 1 1th, in D.C.

890
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,503
-This year? -This year we met, yes.

891
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:30,214
And so for the two previous years you met him - .

892
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:33,008
-Even in 2008? -Yes.

893
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:37,012
One of the six Federal Reserve Board governors serving under Bernanke -

894
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,597
- was Frederic Mishkin -

895
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:42,267
- who was appointed by President Bush in 2006.

896
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:46,480
Did you participate in the meetings Robert Gnaizda -

897
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:49,441
- and Greenlining had with the Federal Reserve Board?

898
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:52,486
Yes, l did. I was on the committee that was involved -

899
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:55,239
- with the Consumer Community Affairs Committee.

900
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:59,243
He warned, in an extremely explicit manner, about what was going on.

901
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:02,704
He came to the Federal Reserve Board with loan documentation -

902
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:05,791
- of the kind of loans that were frequently being made.

903
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,794
And he was listened to politely, and nothing was done.

904
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:14,508
So again, l don't know the details in terms of - .

905
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,636
In fact, l just don't-- l--

906
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:21,557
Whatever information he provided, I'm not sure exactly - .

907
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:25,394
To be honest with you, I can't remember this kind of discussion -

908
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:30,399
- but certainly there were issues that were coming up.

909
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,859
The question is, how pervasive are they?

910
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:36,154
-Why didn't you try looking? -l think that people did.

911
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:37,906
We had people looking at--

912
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:41,326
Excuse me. You can't be serious. You would have found things.

913
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:45,831
That's very easy to always say that you can always find it.

914
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,708
As early as 2004 -

915
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:52,170
- the FBI was already warning about an epidemic of mortgage fraud.

916
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:54,631
They reported inflated appraisals -

917
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:58,427
- doctored loan documentation and other fraudulent activity.

918
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:03,807
ln 2005, the IMF's chief economist, Raghuram Rajan -

919
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:07,603
- warned that dangerous incentives could lead to a crisis.

920
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:11,690
Then came Nouriel Roubini's warnings in 2006 -

921
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,359
- Allan Sloan's articles in Fortune magazine -

922
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:16,612
- and The Washington Post in 2007 -

923
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:19,573
- and repeated warnings from the lMF.

924
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:25,537
I said, and on behalf of the institution, the crisis in front of us is a huge crisis.

925
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:26,747
Who did you talk to?

926
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:29,082
The government, Treasury, Fed, everybody.

927
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:35,088
In May of 2007, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman circulated a presentation -

928
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:36,882
- "Who is Holding the Bag?" -

929
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:39,885
- which described how the bubble would unravel.

930
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:43,722
And in early 2008, Charles Morris published his book -

931
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,474
- about the impending crisis.

932
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:50,520
You're not sure. What do you do?

933
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:54,858
You might have some suspicions that underwriting standards are weakened.

934
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:58,487
But then the question is, should you do anything about it?

935
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:03,575
By 2008, home foreclosures were skyrocketing -

936
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:06,912
- and the securitization food chain imploded.

937
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:10,540
Lenders could no longer sell their loans to the investment banks.

938
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:14,169
And as the loans went bad, dozens of lenders failed.

939
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:20,300
Chuck Prince of Citibank famously said -

940
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:24,388
- that we have to dance until the music stops.

941
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:27,849
Actually, the music had stopped already when he said that.

942
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:30,477
The market for CDOs collapsed -

943
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:33,980
- leaving investment banks holding hundreds of billions of dollars -

944
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:38,360
- in loans, CDOs, and real estate they couldn't sell.

945
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:42,114
When the crisis started, both the Bush administration -

946
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:46,618
- and the Federal Reserve were totally behind the curve.

947
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:49,121
They did not understand the extent of it.

948
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:53,375
At what point do you remember thinking for the first time:

949
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,877
"This is dangerous, this is bad"?

950
01:01:56,045 --> 01:02:00,215
I remember very well one-- I think it was a G7 meeting -

951
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,384
- of February, 2008.

952
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:06,471
And l remember discussing the issue with Hank Paulson.

953
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:09,683
And l clearly remember telling Hank:

954
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:12,853
"We are watching this tsunami coming -

955
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:16,773
- and you're just proposing that we ask -

956
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:19,526
- which swimming costume we're going to put on."

957
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:22,028
What was his response? What was his feeling?

958
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:23,613
"Things are under control.

959
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:27,743
Yes, we are looking at this situation carefully -

960
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:31,329
- and, yeah, it's under control."

961
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:36,585
We're gonna keep growing. Okay? And, obviously, I'll say it:

962
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,337
If you're growing, you're not in recession, right?

963
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:41,506
I mean, we all know that.

964
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:48,764
One of the pillars of Wall Street - .

965
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:53,185
ln March 2008, the investment bank Bear Stearns ran out of cash -

966
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:57,564
- and was acquired for $2 a share by JPMorgan Chase.

967
01:02:57,732 --> 01:03:01,401
The deal was backed by $30 billion in emergency guarantees -

968
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:03,028
- from the Federal Reserve.

969
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:07,157
That was when the administration could have come in -

970
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:13,288
- and put in place various measures to reduce system risk.

971
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:18,335
The information I'm receiving is the end is not here -

972
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:20,712
- that there are other shoes to fall.

973
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,215
Well, l've seen those investment banks -

974
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:27,177
- working with the Fed and the SEC -

975
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:33,391
- strengthen their liquidity, strengthen their capital positions.

976
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:37,646
I get reports all the time. Our regulators are very vigilant.

977
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:40,232
On September 7th, 2008 -

978
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:42,984
- Henry Paulson announced the federal takeover -

979
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:47,739
- of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, giant lenders on the brink of collapse.

980
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:52,118
Nothing about our actions today reflects a changed view -

981
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:53,912
- of the housing correction -

982
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:57,123
- or the strength of other U.S. financial institutions.

983
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,416
Two days later -

984
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:02,254
- Lehman Brothers announced record losses of $3.2 billion -

985
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:03,839
- and its stock collapsed.

986
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:09,928
The effects of Lehman and AlG in September still came as a surprise.

987
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:13,557
I mean, this is even after July and Fannie and Freddie.

988
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:18,603
So clearly there was stuff that, as of September -

989
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:22,649
- major stuff, that nobody knew about.

990
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:25,026
I think that's-- l think that's fair.

991
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:29,573
Bear Stearns was rated triple-A like a month before it went bankrupt?

992
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,783
-More likely A2. -A2?

993
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:33,076
-Yeah. -Okay.

994
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:34,995
A2 is still not bankrupt.

995
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:38,665
No, that's a high investment grade. Solid investment grade rating.

996
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:41,918
Lehman Brothers, A2 within days of failing.

997
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:46,882
AlG, double-A within days of being bailed out.

998
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:51,678
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were triple-A when they were rescued.

999
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:55,807
Citigroup, Merrill, all of them had investment-grade ratings.

1000
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:59,728
-How can that be? -Well, that's a good question.

1001
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:01,855
That's a great question.

1002
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:06,943
At no point did the administration ever go to all the major institutions and say:

1003
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:09,988
"This is serious. Tell us what your positions are.

1004
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:14,034
You know, no bullshit. Where are you?"

1005
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:18,246
Well, first, that's what the regulators-- That's their job, right?

1006
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:22,500
Their job is to understand the exposure across these institutions.

1007
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:25,587
And they have a very refined understanding -

1008
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:29,716
- that l think became more respon-- More refined as the crisis proceeded.

1009
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:33,011
-So-- -Forgive me, but that's clearly not true.

1010
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,013
What do you mean, that's not true?

1011
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:36,264
In August of 2008 -

1012
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:42,312
- were you aware of the credit ratings held by Lehman Brothers -

1013
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,189
- Merrill Lynch, AIG -

1014
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,816
- and did you think that they were accurate?

1015
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:49,986
Well, certainly by that time -

1016
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:53,031
- it was clear earlier credit ratings weren't accurate.

1017
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:55,867
-They had been downgraded. -No, they hadn't.

1018
01:05:56,035 --> 01:06:00,163
There was downgrading in terms of the industry and concerns of the--

1019
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:02,707
All those firms were rated at least A2 -

1020
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:05,627
- until a couple of days before they were rescued.

1021
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:10,382
The answer is l don't know enough to answer your question on this issue.

1022
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:13,927
Governor Fred Mishkin is resigning, effective August 31 .

1023
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:18,056
He plans to return to Columbia's Graduate School of Business.

1024
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:21,226
Why did you leave the Federal Reserve in August of 2008 -

1025
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:24,187
- in the middle of the worst financial crisis?

1026
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:28,483
So that-- I had to revise a textbook.

1027
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:32,404
His departure leaves the board with three of its seven seats vacant -

1028
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:34,739
- just when the economy needs it most.

1029
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:38,785
I'm sure your textbook is important and widely read, but in August 2008 -

1030
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:43,081
- some more important things were going on in the world, don't you think?

1031
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:45,583
By Friday, September 1 2th -

1032
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:47,877
- Lehman Brothers had run out of cash -

1033
01:06:48,045 --> 01:06:51,756
- and the entire investment-banking industry was sinking fast.

1034
01:06:51,924 --> 01:06:55,593
The stability of the global financial system was in jeopardy.

1035
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:59,597
That weekend, Henry Paulson and Timothy Geithner -

1036
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:02,183
- president of the New York Federal Reserve -

1037
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:05,812
- called an emergency meeting with the CEOs of the major banks -

1038
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,522
- in an effort to rescue Lehman.

1039
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:10,442
But Lehman wasn't alone.

1040
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:15,071
Merrill Lynch was also on the brink of failure.

1041
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:19,034
And that Sunday, it was acquired by Bank of America.

1042
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:24,289
The only bank interested in buying Lehman was the British firm Barclays.

1043
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:28,293
But British regulators demanded a financial guarantee from the U.S.

1044
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:30,879
Paulson refused.

1045
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:37,844
We got in a cab and went to the Federal Reserve Bank.

1046
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:45,727
They wanted the bankruptcy case commenced before midnight -

1047
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,896
- of September 14.

1048
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:54,319
We kept pressing that this would be a terrible event -

1049
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:57,113
- and at some point I used the word Armageddon -

1050
01:07:57,281 --> 01:08:01,910
- and they consider the consequences of what they were proposing.

1051
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:04,621
The effect on the market would be extraordinary.

1052
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:06,581
-You said this? -Yes.

1053
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:11,836
They just said they had considered all of the comments we had made -

1054
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:17,467
- and they were still of the belief that in order to calm the markets -

1055
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:21,346
- and move forward, it was necessary for Lehman to go into bankruptcy.

1056
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:22,889
-"Calm the markets"? -Yes.

1057
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:27,685
When were you first told that Lehman, in fact, was going to go bankrupt?

1058
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:31,564
-After the fact. -After the fact?

1059
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,901
Okay.

1060
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:41,157
And what was your reaction when you learned of it?

1061
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:43,368
"Holy cow."

1062
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:46,871
Paulson and Bernanke had not consulted with other governments -

1063
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:50,041
- and didn't know the consequences of foreign bankruptcy laws.

1064
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,960
--Lehman Brothers London empty their desks - .

1065
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:54,546
Under British law -

1066
01:08:54,713 --> 01:08:58,049
- Lehman's London office had to be closed immediately.

1067
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:02,428
All transactions came to a halt, and there are thousands of transactions.

1068
01:09:02,596 --> 01:09:05,974
The hedge funds who had had assets with Lehman in London -

1069
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,935
- discovered overnight, to their complete horror -

1070
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:11,229
- they couldn't get those assets back.

1071
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:14,149
One of the points of the hub failed.

1072
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:17,443
And that had huge knock-on effects around the system.

1073
01:09:17,611 --> 01:09:19,696
The oldest money market fund in the nation -

1074
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:23,908
- wrote off three-quarters of a billion dollars in bad debt -

1075
01:09:24,076 --> 01:09:26,077
- issued by now-bankrupt Lehman Brothers.

1076
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:29,414
Lehman's failure caused a collapse in the commercial paper market -

1077
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:33,334
- which many companies depend on to pay for expenses -

1078
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:34,836
- such as payroll.

1079
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:37,964
That means they have to lay off employees, they can't buy parts.

1080
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:39,924
It stops business in its tracks.

1081
01:09:40,092 --> 01:09:42,969
People stood and said, "Listen, what can we believe in?

1082
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:45,096
There's nothing we can trust anymore."

1083
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:48,850
That same week, AIG owed $1 3 billion -

1084
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:52,896
- to holders of credit default swaps and it didn't have the money.

1085
01:09:53,063 --> 01:09:55,023
AlG was another hub.

1086
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:59,277
If AIG had stopped, you know, all planes may have to stop flying.

1087
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:02,864
On September 17th, AlG is taken over by the government.

1088
01:10:04,241 --> 01:10:06,951
One day later, Paulson and Bernanke ask Congress -

1089
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:09,579
- for $700 billion to bail out the banks.

1090
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:11,080
We're coming together - .

1091
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:15,627
They warned that the alternative would be a catastrophic collapse.

1092
01:10:15,794 --> 01:10:18,463
It was scary. You know, the entire system froze up.

1093
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:22,425
Every part of the financial system, every part of the credit system.

1094
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:24,302
Nobody could borrow money.

1095
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,639
It was like a cardiac arrest of the global financial system.

1096
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:29,224
I'm playing the hand dealt me.

1097
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:32,352
A lot of what I'm dealing with--

1098
01:10:32,519 --> 01:10:36,981
I'm dealing with the consequences of things that were done years ago.

1099
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:38,983
Secretary Paulson spoke through the fall.

1100
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:42,195
All the potential root causes of this, and there are plenty -

1101
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:45,990
- - he called them. I'm not sure-- -You're not being serious about that.

1102
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:48,868
I am being serious. What would you have expected?

1103
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:51,454
What were you looking for that you didn't see?

1104
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:54,415
He was the senior advocate -

1105
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:58,962
- for prohibiting the regulation of credit default swaps -

1106
01:10:59,129 --> 01:11:02,715
- and also lifting the leverage limits on the investment banks.

1107
01:11:02,883 --> 01:11:03,925
So again, what--?

1108
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:07,553
He mentioned those things? l never heard him mention those things.

1109
01:11:07,721 --> 01:11:10,431
Could we turn this off for a second?

1110
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:19,023
When AIG was bailed out, the owners of its credit default swaps -

1111
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:21,859
- the most prominent of which was Goldman Sachs -

1112
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:25,571
- were paid $61 billion the next day.

1113
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:27,865
Paulson, Bernanke and Tim Geithner -

1114
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:31,244
- forced AIG to pay 1 00 cents on the dollar -

1115
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:34,205
- rather than negotiate lower prices.

1116
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:40,545
Eventually, the AIG bailout cost taxpayers over $1 50 billion.

1117
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:44,090
A hundred and sixty billion dollars went through AlG.

1118
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:47,051
Fourteen billion went to Goldman Sachs.

1119
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:50,430
At the same time, Paulson and Geithner forced AlG -

1120
01:11:50,597 --> 01:11:54,559
- to surrender its right to sue Goldman and the other banks for fraud.

1121
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:59,772
Isn't there a problem when the person in charge of dealing with this crisis -

1122
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:02,108
- is the former CEO of Goldman Sachs?

1123
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:05,862
Someone who had a major role in causing it.

1124
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:08,740
It's fair to say that the financial markets today -

1125
01:12:08,907 --> 01:12:10,742
- are incredibly complicated.

1126
01:12:10,909 --> 01:12:12,618
--and supply urgently needed money - .

1127
01:12:12,786 --> 01:12:15,038
On October 4th, 2008 -

1128
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:19,250
- President Bush signs a 700-billion-dollar bailout bill.

1129
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:21,753
But world stock markets continue to fall -

1130
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,756
- amid fears that a global recession is now underway.

1131
01:12:30,095 --> 01:12:33,389
The bailout legislation does nothing to stem the tide of layoffs -

1132
01:12:33,557 --> 01:12:35,350
- and foreclosures.

1133
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:40,605
Unemployment in the United States and Europe rises to 1 0 percent.

1134
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:44,108
The recession accelerates and spreads globally.

1135
01:12:47,946 --> 01:12:52,200
I began to get really scared because l hadn't foreseen -

1136
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:56,954
- the whole world going down at the same rate at the same time.

1137
01:12:57,623 --> 01:12:59,457
By December of 2008 -

1138
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:03,127
- General Motors and Chrysler are facing bankruptcy.

1139
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:06,214
And as U.S. consumers cut back on spending -

1140
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:09,926
- Chinese manufacturers see sales plummet.

1141
01:13:10,969 --> 01:13:15,473
Over 1 0 million migrant workers in China lose their jobs.

1142
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:20,478
At the end of the day, the poorest, as always, pay the most.

1143
01:13:25,984 --> 01:13:27,985
Here, you can earn a lot of money.

1144
01:13:28,153 --> 01:13:32,323
Like 70, 80 U.S. dollars per month.

1145
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:40,164
As a farmer in the countryside, you cannot earn as much money.

1146
01:13:40,332 --> 01:13:44,419
The workers, they just wire their salary to their hometown -

1147
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:47,338
- to give to their families.

1148
01:13:47,714 --> 01:13:50,591
The crisis started in America.

1149
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:54,512
We all know it will be coming to China.

1150
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:02,019
Some of the factories try to cut off some workers.

1151
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:06,774
And some people will get poor because they'll lose their jobs.

1152
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:09,569
Life gets harder.

1153
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,705
We were growing at about 20 percent.

1154
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:27,920
It was a super year. Then we suddenly went to minus-nine this quarter.

1155
01:14:28,088 --> 01:14:32,842
Exports collapsed, and we're talking like 30 percent.

1156
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:37,263
So we just took a hit, you know. Fell off a cliff.

1157
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:41,559
Even as the crisis unfolded, we didn't know how wide it was going to spread -

1158
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:43,561
- or how severe it was going to be.

1159
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:46,355
We were still hoping that there would be some way -

1160
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:51,527
- for us to have a shelter and be less battered by the storm.

1161
01:14:51,695 --> 01:14:52,904
But it's not possible.

1162
01:14:53,363 --> 01:14:55,072
It's a very globalized world.

1163
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:58,075
The economies are all linked together.

1164
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:32,109
Every time a home goes into foreclosure -

1165
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:34,612
- it affects everyone who lives around that house.

1166
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:37,949
When that house goes on the market, it'll be sold at a lower price.

1167
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:41,452
Maybe before it goes on the market, it won't be well-maintained.

1168
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:44,956
We estimate another 9 million homeowners will lose their homes.

1169
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:54,465
We went out on a weekend to see what houses were for sale.

1170
01:15:56,301 --> 01:15:57,718
We saw one we liked.

1171
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:01,722
The payment was going to be $3200.

1172
01:16:13,318 --> 01:16:15,987
Everything was beautiful, the house was very pretty.

1173
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:18,197
The payment low. Everything was--

1174
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:20,074
We won the lottery.

1175
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:23,160
But the reality was when the first payment arrived.

1176
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:33,713
I felt very bad for my husband -

1177
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:40,344
- because he works too much. And we have three children.

1178
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:52,023
The majority l've seen are people hurt by the economy.

1179
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:56,527
They were living day to day, paycheck to paycheck -

1180
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:57,945
- and that ran out.

1181
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:01,449
Unemployment won't pay a mortgage. It won't pay a car bill.

1182
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:03,784
I was a log truck driver.

1183
01:17:05,912 --> 01:17:08,789
They shut down the logging systems, shut down the sawmills.

1184
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:11,417
So l moved down here on a construction job.

1185
01:17:11,585 --> 01:17:14,462
And the construction jobs got shut down too, so - .

1186
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,173
Things are so tough. There's a lot of people out there.

1187
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:19,717
Soon you're gonna be seeing more camps like this -

1188
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:22,053
- because there's just no jobs right now.

1189
01:17:28,393 --> 01:17:32,980
When the company did well, we did well.

1190
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:36,942
When the company did not do well, sir, we did not do well.

1191
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:39,403
The men who destroyed their own companies -

1192
01:17:39,571 --> 01:17:41,322
- and plunged the world into crisis -

1193
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:44,825
- walked away from the wreckage with their fortunes intact.

1194
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:48,579
The top five executives at Lehman Brothers made over a billion dollars -

1195
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:50,456
- between 2000 and 2007.

1196
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:55,461
And when the firm went bankrupt, they got to keep all the money.

1197
01:17:55,629 --> 01:17:57,254
The system worked.

1198
01:17:57,422 --> 01:18:00,216
It doesn't make sense to make a failing loan because we lose.

1199
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:04,428
The borrower loses, the community loses and we lose.

1200
01:18:04,596 --> 01:18:06,931
Countrywide's CEO, Angelo Mozilo -

1201
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:11,435
- made $470 million between 2003 and 2008.

1202
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:15,439
One hundred forty million came from dumping his Countrywide stock -

1203
01:18:15,607 --> 01:18:18,359
- in the 1 2 months before the company collapsed.

1204
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:21,195
I hold the board accountable when a business fails.

1205
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:24,073
They're responsible for hiring and firing the CEO -

1206
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:26,409
- and overseeing big strategic decisions.

1207
01:18:26,576 --> 01:18:29,578
The problem with boards in America is the way boards are elected.

1208
01:18:29,746 --> 01:18:33,290
You know, the boards are pretty much, in many cases, picked by the CEO.

1209
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:35,960
The board of directors and compensation committees -

1210
01:18:36,128 --> 01:18:41,215
- are the two bodies best situated to determine pay for executives.

1211
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:43,843
How do you think they've done over the past 1 0 years?

1212
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:49,390
Well, l think that if you look at those-- I would give about a B, because--

1213
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:50,599
-A B? -A B, yes.

1214
01:18:50,767 --> 01:18:52,476
-Not an F? -Not an F, not an F.

1215
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:55,479
Stan O'Neal, the CEO of Merrill Lynch -

1216
01:18:55,647 --> 01:19:00,109
- received $90 million in 2006 and 2007 alone.

1217
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:02,445
After driving his firm into the ground -

1218
01:19:02,612 --> 01:19:05,197
- the board of directors allowed him to resign -

1219
01:19:05,365 --> 01:19:09,326
- and he collected $1 61 million in severance.

1220
01:19:09,661 --> 01:19:13,706
Instead of being fired, Stan O'Neal is allowed to resign -

1221
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:17,084
- and takes away $1 51 million.

1222
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:19,712
That's a decision that that board of directors made.

1223
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,714
What grade do you give that decision?

1224
01:19:21,882 --> 01:19:24,759
That's a tougher one. I don't know if l'd give it a B as well.

1225
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:31,348
O'Neal's successor, John Thain, was paid $87 million in 2007.

1226
01:19:31,516 --> 01:19:33,142
And in December of 2008 -

1227
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:37,021
- two months after Merrill was bailed out by U.S. taxpayers -

1228
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:41,400
- Thain and Merrill's board handed out billions in bonuses.

1229
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:46,155
ln March of 2008, AlG's Financial Products division -

1230
01:19:46,323 --> 01:19:47,740
- lost $1 1 billion.

1231
01:19:49,159 --> 01:19:53,078
Instead of being fired, Joseph Cassano, head of AIGFP -

1232
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:57,374
- was kept on as a consultant for a million dollars a month.

1233
01:19:57,542 --> 01:20:03,047
You wanna make sure key players and key employees within AlGFP -

1234
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:05,382
- we retain that intellectual knowledge.

1235
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:07,510
I attended a very interesting dinner -

1236
01:20:07,677 --> 01:20:11,347
- organized by Hank Paulson a little more than one year ago -

1237
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:14,141
- with some officials and a couple of CEOs -

1238
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:16,560
- from the biggest banks in the U.S.

1239
01:20:16,728 --> 01:20:21,065
And surprisingly enough, all these gentlemen were arguing:

1240
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:25,236
"We were too greedy, so we have part of the responsibility." Fine.

1241
01:20:25,403 --> 01:20:29,198
Then they were turning to the treasurer, Secretary of the Treasury, and saying:

1242
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:32,535
"You should regulate more. We're too greedy, we can't avoid it.

1243
01:20:32,702 --> 01:20:35,663
The only way to avoid this is to have more regulation."

1244
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:38,749
I have spoken to many bankers about this question -

1245
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:40,835
- including very senior ones.

1246
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:45,798
And this is the first time that I've ever heard anybody say -

1247
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:49,009
- they wanted their compensation to be regulated in any way.

1248
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:52,388
Yeah, because it was at the moment where they were afraid.

1249
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:56,851
And after, when solution to the crisis began to appear -

1250
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:59,270
- then probably they changed their mind.

1251
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:05,526
In the U.S., the banks are now bigger, more powerful -

1252
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:08,779
- and more concentrated than ever before.

1253
01:21:08,947 --> 01:21:10,781
There are fewer competitors.

1254
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:14,952
A lot of smaller banks have been taken over by big ones.

1255
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,538
J.P. Morgan is even bigger than it was before.

1256
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:21,667
J.P. Morgan took over first Bear Stearns and then WaMu.

1257
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:25,671
Bank of America took over Countrywide and Merrill Lynch.

1258
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:28,340
Wells Fargo took over Wachovia.

1259
01:21:28,508 --> 01:21:30,801
After the crisis, the financial industry -

1260
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:33,804
- including the Financial Services Roundtable -

1261
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:36,473
- worked harder than ever to fight reform.

1262
01:21:36,641 --> 01:21:39,310
The financial sector employs 3000 lobbyists -

1263
01:21:39,853 --> 01:21:43,314
- more than five for each member of Congress.

1264
01:21:43,815 --> 01:21:45,816
You think the financial services industry -

1265
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:48,652
- has excessive political influence in the United States?

1266
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:53,240
No. I think that every person in the country -

1267
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:55,200
- is represented here in Washington.

1268
01:21:55,368 --> 01:21:59,121
And you think that all segments of American society -

1269
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:02,625
- have equal and fair access to the system?

1270
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:07,671
That you can walk into any hearing room that you would like. Yes, l do.

1271
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:11,133
One can walk into any hearing room. One cannot necessarily -

1272
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:14,136
- write the lobbying checks that your industry writes -

1273
01:22:14,304 --> 01:22:18,098
- or engage in the level of political contributions your industry engages in.

1274
01:22:18,391 --> 01:22:21,268
Between 1 998 and 2008 -

1275
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:24,355
- the financial industry spent over $5 billion -

1276
01:22:24,522 --> 01:22:27,024
- on lobbying and campaign contributions.

1277
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:30,069
And since the crisis, they're spending even more money.

1278
01:22:31,821 --> 01:22:34,281
The financial industry also exerts its influence -

1279
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:38,369
- in a more subtle way, one that most Americans don't know about.

1280
01:22:39,996 --> 01:22:42,539
It has corrupted the study of economics itself.

1281
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:50,089
Deregulation had tremendous financial and intellectual support -

1282
01:22:50,256 --> 01:22:54,718
- because people argued it for their own benefit.

1283
01:22:54,886 --> 01:22:59,556
The economics profession was the main source of that illusion.

1284
01:22:59,891 --> 01:23:02,935
Since the 1 980s, academic economists -

1285
01:23:03,103 --> 01:23:05,562
- have been major advocates of deregulation -

1286
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:09,108
- and played powerful roles in shaping U.S. government policy.

1287
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:13,445
Very few of these economic experts warned about the crisis.

1288
01:23:13,613 --> 01:23:18,158
And even after the crisis, many of them opposed reform.

1289
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:22,287
The guys who taught these things tended to get paid a lot of money -

1290
01:23:22,455 --> 01:23:24,581
- being consultants.

1291
01:23:24,749 --> 01:23:29,336
Business school professors don't live on a faculty salary.

1292
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:33,090
They do very, very well.

1293
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:36,301
Over the last decade, the financial services industries -

1294
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:42,725
- made about $5 billion worth of political contributions in the U.S.

1295
01:23:43,768 --> 01:23:46,103
That's kind of a lot of money.

1296
01:23:46,604 --> 01:23:49,273
-That doesn't bother you? -No.

1297
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:51,942
Martin Feldstein is a professor at Harvard -

1298
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:54,528
- and one of the world's most prominent economists.

1299
01:23:54,904 --> 01:23:57,698
As President Reagan's chief economic advisor -

1300
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:00,284
- he was a major architect of deregulation.

1301
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:03,495
And from 1 988 until 2009 -

1302
01:24:03,788 --> 01:24:06,915
- he was on the board of directors of both AlG -

1303
01:24:07,083 --> 01:24:09,043
- and AlG Financial Products -

1304
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:11,462
- which paid him millions of dollars.

1305
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:14,590
You have any regrets about having been on AlG's board?

1306
01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:18,427
I have no comments. No, I have no regrets about being on AlG's board.

1307
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:22,014
-None? -That I can say. Absolutely none.

1308
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:23,640
Okay.

1309
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:30,773
You have any regrets about AlG's decisions?

1310
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:33,692
I cannot say anything more about AlG.

1311
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:37,946
I've taught at Northwestern in Chicago, Harvard and Columbia.

1312
01:24:38,114 --> 01:24:41,033
Glenn Hubbard is the dean of Columbia Business School -

1313
01:24:41,201 --> 01:24:43,911
- and was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers -

1314
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:46,080
- under George W. Bush.

1315
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:48,373
Do you think the financial services industry -

1316
01:24:48,541 --> 01:24:51,960
- has too much political power in the United States?

1317
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:56,548
I don't think so. No. You certainly wouldn't get that impression -

1318
01:24:56,716 --> 01:25:00,511
- by the drubbing that they regularly get in Washington.

1319
01:25:00,678 --> 01:25:03,514
Many prominent academics quietly make fortunes -

1320
01:25:03,681 --> 01:25:08,519
- helping the financial industry shape public debate and government policy.

1321
01:25:08,686 --> 01:25:11,939
The Analysis Group, Charles River Associates -

1322
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:13,440
- Compass Lexecon -

1323
01:25:13,608 --> 01:25:15,859
- and the Law and Economics Consulting Group -

1324
01:25:16,027 --> 01:25:18,237
- manage a multibillion-dollar industry -

1325
01:25:18,404 --> 01:25:21,698
- that provides academic experts for hire.

1326
01:25:21,866 --> 01:25:23,867
Two bankers who used these services -

1327
01:25:24,035 --> 01:25:27,079
- were Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin -

1328
01:25:27,247 --> 01:25:31,208
- Bear Stearns hedge fund managers prosecuted for securities fraud.

1329
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:34,545
After hiring the Analysis Group, both were acquitted.

1330
01:25:34,879 --> 01:25:40,134
Glenn Hubbard was paid $1 00,000 to testify in their defense.

1331
01:25:40,802 --> 01:25:46,640
Do you think the economics discipline has a conflict-of-interest problem?

1332
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:49,268
I'm not sure l know what you mean.

1333
01:25:49,435 --> 01:25:53,730
Do you think a significant fraction of the economics discipline, economists -

1334
01:25:53,898 --> 01:25:59,069
- have financial conflicts of interest that might call into question or color--?

1335
01:25:59,237 --> 01:26:01,238
I see what you're saying. I doubt it.

1336
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:06,577
Most academic economists aren't wealthy business people.

1337
01:26:06,744 --> 01:26:10,914
Hubbard makes $250,000 a year as a board member of MetLife -

1338
01:26:11,082 --> 01:26:13,500
- and was formerly on the board of Capmark -

1339
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:16,712
- a major commercial mortgage lender during the bubble -

1340
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,922
- which went bankrupt in 2009.

1341
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:21,466
He has also advised Nomura Securities -

1342
01:26:21,634 --> 01:26:26,054
- KKR Financial Corporation and many other financial firms.

1343
01:26:27,348 --> 01:26:30,475
Laura Tyson, who declined to be interviewed for this film -

1344
01:26:30,643 --> 01:26:34,438
- is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

1345
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:37,816
She was the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers -

1346
01:26:37,984 --> 01:26:41,445
- then director of the National Economic Council under Clinton.

1347
01:26:41,613 --> 01:26:45,282
After leaving government, she joined the board of Morgan Stanley -

1348
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:48,994
- which pays her $350,000 a year.

1349
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:51,663
Ruth Simmons, president of Brown University -

1350
01:26:51,831 --> 01:26:56,919
- makes over $300,000 a year on the board of Goldman Sachs.

1351
01:26:57,128 --> 01:27:00,172
Larry Summers, who, as Treasury secretary, played a role -

1352
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:05,677
- in the deregulation of derivatives, became president of Harvard in 2001 .

1353
01:27:06,012 --> 01:27:09,348
While at Harvard, he made millions consulting to hedge funds -

1354
01:27:09,515 --> 01:27:13,894
- and millions more in speaking fees, much of it from investment banks.

1355
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:20,025
According to his federal disclosure report, Summers' net worth -

1356
01:27:20,193 --> 01:27:25,239
- is between $1 6.5 million and $39.5 million.

1357
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:28,825
Frederic Mishkin, who returned to Columbia Business School -

1358
01:27:28,993 --> 01:27:33,121
- after leaving the Federal Reserve, reported on his disclosure report -

1359
01:27:33,289 --> 01:27:37,668
- that his net worth was between $6 million and $17 million.

1360
01:27:38,127 --> 01:27:42,547
In 2006, you coauthored a study of lceland's financial system.

1361
01:27:42,757 --> 01:27:44,549
"Iceland is an advanced country -

1362
01:27:44,717 --> 01:27:47,928
- with excellent institutions, low corruption, rule of law.

1363
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:51,098
The economy has adjusted to financial liberalization -

1364
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:55,519
- while prudential regulation and supervision is generally quite strong."

1365
01:27:55,687 --> 01:27:58,397
And that was the mistake, that it turns out -

1366
01:27:58,564 --> 01:28:02,025
- prudential regulation and supervision was not strong in lceland -

1367
01:28:02,193 --> 01:28:05,070
- - during this period-- -What led you to think it was?

1368
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:07,531
You're going with the information you had -

1369
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:13,203
- and generally, the view was that Iceland had very good institutions.

1370
01:28:13,371 --> 01:28:15,872
-lt was an advanced country-- -Who told you that?

1371
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,458
-What research did you do? -You talk to people.

1372
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:23,213
You have faith in the central bank, which actually did fall down on the job.

1373
01:28:23,381 --> 01:28:25,841
That clearly it-- This--

1374
01:28:26,009 --> 01:28:29,553
-Why have faith in a central bank? -Well, that faith-- You try--

1375
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:31,888
Because you go with the information you have.

1376
01:28:32,056 --> 01:28:34,683
-How much were you paid to write it? -l was paid--

1377
01:28:34,851 --> 01:28:37,227
I think the number-- It's public information.

1378
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:47,904
On your CV, the title of this report has been changed -

1379
01:28:48,072 --> 01:28:52,242
- from "Financial Stability in lceland" to "Financial lnstability in Iceland."

1380
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:56,955
Well, l don't know. Whatever it is-- If there's a typo, there's a typo.

1381
01:28:57,123 --> 01:28:58,999
What should be publicly available -

1382
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:01,585
- is whenever anybody does research on a topic -

1383
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:06,465
- that they disclose if they have any financial conflict with that research.

1384
01:29:06,632 --> 01:29:10,635
But if I recall, there is no policy to that effect.

1385
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:16,641
I can't imagine anybody not doing that in terms of putting it in a paper. You--

1386
01:29:16,809 --> 01:29:20,437
There would be significant professional sanction for failure to do that.

1387
01:29:20,605 --> 01:29:25,233
I didn't see any place in the study where you indicated you'd been paid -

1388
01:29:25,401 --> 01:29:28,695
- by the lcelandic Chamber of Commerce to produce it.

1389
01:29:28,863 --> 01:29:31,656
-No, I don't-- You know. -Okay.

1390
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:35,035
Richard Portes, the most famous economist in Britain -

1391
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:37,329
- and a professor at London Business School -

1392
01:29:37,497 --> 01:29:41,583
- was also commissioned by the lcelandic Chamber of Commerce -

1393
01:29:41,751 --> 01:29:45,796
- to write a report which praised the lcelandic financial sector.

1394
01:29:46,339 --> 01:29:48,215
The banks themselves are highly liquid.

1395
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:51,176
They've made money on the fall of the Icelandic krona.

1396
01:29:51,344 --> 01:29:52,761
These are strong banks.

1397
01:29:52,929 --> 01:29:56,181
Their market funding is assured for the coming year.

1398
01:29:56,349 --> 01:29:58,308
-These are well-run banks. -Thank you.

1399
01:29:58,476 --> 01:30:01,812
Like Mishkin, Portes' report didn't disclose his payment -

1400
01:30:01,979 --> 01:30:04,481
- from the lcelandic Chamber of Commerce.

1401
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:07,776
Does Harvard require disclosures of financial conflict of interest?

1402
01:30:10,988 --> 01:30:12,030
Not to my knowledge.

1403
01:30:12,198 --> 01:30:15,242
Do you require people to report the compensation -

1404
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:17,953
- - received from outside activities? -No.

1405
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:19,830
Don't you think that's a problem?

1406
01:30:19,997 --> 01:30:21,248
I don't see why.

1407
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:24,084
Martin Feldstein being on the board of AIG -

1408
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:26,169
- Laura Tyson at Morgan Stanley -

1409
01:30:26,337 --> 01:30:31,174
- Larry Summers making $1 0 million consulting to financial services firms - .

1410
01:30:31,342 --> 01:30:32,676
Irrelevant?

1411
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:33,844
Yeah.

1412
01:30:34,011 --> 01:30:35,512
Yeah. Basically irrelevant.

1413
01:30:38,349 --> 01:30:41,184
You've written many articles about a wide array of subjects.

1414
01:30:41,352 --> 01:30:44,104
You never saw fit to investigate the risks -

1415
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:47,607
- of unregulated credit default swaps?

1416
01:30:47,859 --> 01:30:49,526
I never did.

1417
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:53,447
Same question with regard to executive compensation?

1418
01:30:53,614 --> 01:30:55,615
The regulation of corporate governance?

1419
01:30:55,783 --> 01:30:58,118
The effect of political contributions?

1420
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:02,247
I don't know that l would have anything to add to those discussions.

1421
01:31:02,415 --> 01:31:04,499
I'm looking at your resume now.

1422
01:31:04,667 --> 01:31:09,463
It looks to me as if the majority of your outside activities -

1423
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:12,466
- are consulting and directorship arrangements -

1424
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:14,718
- with the financial services industry.

1425
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:17,053
Would you not agree with that characterization?

1426
01:31:17,221 --> 01:31:20,515
To my knowledge, l don't think my consulting clients are on my CV.

1427
01:31:20,683 --> 01:31:23,560
-So I wouldn't know. -Who are your consulting clients?

1428
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:25,896
I don't believe l have to discuss that with you.

1429
01:31:26,063 --> 01:31:27,230
Okay.

1430
01:31:27,857 --> 01:31:31,776
In fact, you have a few more minutes and the interview's over.

1431
01:31:31,944 --> 01:31:34,571
Do you consult for any financial services firms?

1432
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:37,282
-The answer is l do. -And?

1433
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:40,619
And-- But l do not wanna go into details about that.

1434
01:31:40,786 --> 01:31:43,580
Do they include other financial services firms?

1435
01:31:43,748 --> 01:31:44,915
Possibly.

1436
01:31:45,082 --> 01:31:46,750
You don't remember?

1437
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:50,170
This isn't a deposition, sir. I was polite enough to give you time.

1438
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:54,049
Foolishly, l now see. But you have three more minutes.

1439
01:31:54,217 --> 01:31:56,051
Give it your best shot.

1440
01:31:56,219 --> 01:31:58,845
ln 2004, at the height of the bubble -

1441
01:31:59,013 --> 01:32:02,849
- Glenn Hubbard coauthored a widely read paper with William C. Dudley -

1442
01:32:03,017 --> 01:32:05,810
- the chief economist of Goldman Sachs.

1443
01:32:05,978 --> 01:32:08,563
In the paper, Hubbard praised credit derivatives -

1444
01:32:08,731 --> 01:32:10,524
- and the securitization chain -

1445
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:13,276
- stating they had improved allocation of capital -

1446
01:32:13,444 --> 01:32:15,946
- and were enhancing financial stability.

1447
01:32:16,113 --> 01:32:18,615
He cited reduced volatility in the economy -

1448
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:23,453
- and stated that recessions had become less frequent and milder.

1449
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:26,623
Credit derivatives were protecting banks against losses -

1450
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:28,625
- and helping to distribute risk.

1451
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:33,922
A medical researcher writes an article, saying:

1452
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:38,635
"To treat this disease, you should prescribe this drug."

1453
01:32:38,928 --> 01:32:41,972
Turns out doctor makes 80 percent of personal income -

1454
01:32:42,139 --> 01:32:45,308
- from manufacture of this drug. Does not bother you?

1455
01:32:45,476 --> 01:32:50,021
I think it's certainly important to disclose the - .

1456
01:32:55,528 --> 01:32:57,696
Well, l think that's also a little different -

1457
01:32:57,863 --> 01:33:01,825
- from cases that we're talking about here because - .

1458
01:33:17,174 --> 01:33:21,386
So, what do you think this says about the economics discipline?

1459
01:33:21,554 --> 01:33:25,515
Well, l mean, it has no relevance to anything, really.

1460
01:33:25,683 --> 01:33:29,603
And, indeed, I think it's a part of the--

1461
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:33,690
It's an important part of the problem.

1462
01:33:49,123 --> 01:33:51,625
The rising power of the U.S. financial sector -

1463
01:33:51,792 --> 01:33:54,544
- was part of a wider change in America.

1464
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:59,549
Since the 1 980s, the United States has become a more unequal society -

1465
01:34:00,092 --> 01:34:03,511
- and its economic dominance has declined.

1466
01:34:03,804 --> 01:34:08,266
Companies like General Motors, Chrysler and U.S. Steel -

1467
01:34:08,434 --> 01:34:11,019
- formerly the core of the U.S. economy -

1468
01:34:11,187 --> 01:34:15,774
- were poorly managed and falling behind their foreign competitors.

1469
01:34:16,567 --> 01:34:19,653
And as countries like China opened their economies -

1470
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:23,990
- American companies sent jobs overseas to save money.

1471
01:34:25,951 --> 01:34:29,287
For many, many years, the 660 million people -

1472
01:34:29,455 --> 01:34:31,748
- in the developed world were sheltered -

1473
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:35,794
- from all of this additional labor that existed on the planet.

1474
01:34:35,961 --> 01:34:38,838
Suddenly the Bamboo Curtain and the lron Curtain are lifted -

1475
01:34:39,006 --> 01:34:42,175
- and you have 2.5 billion additional people.

1476
01:34:42,885 --> 01:34:46,888
American factory workers were laid off by the tens of thousands.

1477
01:34:47,056 --> 01:34:49,683
Our manufacturing base was destroyed, literally -

1478
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:51,142
- over a few years.

1479
01:34:51,310 --> 01:34:55,605
As manufacturing declined, other industries rose.

1480
01:34:55,773 --> 01:34:59,025
The United States leads the world in information technology -

1481
01:34:59,193 --> 01:35:02,278
- where high-paying jobs are easy to find.

1482
01:35:02,446 --> 01:35:04,614
But those jobs require an education.

1483
01:35:04,907 --> 01:35:09,786
And for average Americans, college is increasingly out of reach.

1484
01:35:11,288 --> 01:35:15,250
While universities like Harvard have billions of dollars in endowments -

1485
01:35:15,418 --> 01:35:19,713
- funding for public universities is shrinking and tuition is rising.

1486
01:35:20,673 --> 01:35:23,133
Tuition for California's public universities -

1487
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:28,638
- rose from $650 in the 1 970s to over $1 0,000 in 201 0.

1488
01:35:30,683 --> 01:35:34,978
The most important determinant of whether Americans go to college -

1489
01:35:35,146 --> 01:35:38,148
- is whether they can find the money to pay for it.

1490
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:43,361
Meanwhile, American tax policy shifted to favor the wealthy.

1491
01:35:44,905 --> 01:35:48,742
When I first came to office, l thought taxes were too high, and they were.

1492
01:35:48,909 --> 01:35:51,703
The most dramatic change was a series of tax cuts -

1493
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:54,497
- designed by Glenn Hubbard, who was serving -

1494
01:35:54,665 --> 01:35:58,001
- as President Bush's chief economic advisor.

1495
01:35:58,711 --> 01:36:02,338
The Bush administration sharply reduced taxes on investment gains -

1496
01:36:02,506 --> 01:36:05,508
- stock dividends, and eliminated the estate tax.

1497
01:36:05,676 --> 01:36:08,845
We had a comprehensive plan that when acted -

1498
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:12,766
- has left nearly $1 .1 trillion in the hands of American workers -

1499
01:36:12,933 --> 01:36:15,518
- families, investors and small-business owners.

1500
01:36:15,686 --> 01:36:20,231
Most benefits of these cuts went to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans.

1501
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:24,319
And by the way, it was the cornerstone -

1502
01:36:24,487 --> 01:36:26,863
- in many ways, of our economic recovery policy.

1503
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:29,866
Inequality of wealth in the United States -

1504
01:36:30,034 --> 01:36:33,411
- is now higher than in any other developed country.

1505
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:36,790
American families responded to these changes in two ways:

1506
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:42,796
By working longer hours and by going into debt.

1507
01:36:42,963 --> 01:36:46,549
As the middle class falls further and further behind -

1508
01:36:46,717 --> 01:36:50,595
- there is a political urge to respond -

1509
01:36:50,763 --> 01:36:54,098
- by making it easier to get credit.

1510
01:36:54,266 --> 01:36:55,892
You don't have to have a lousy home.

1511
01:36:57,353 --> 01:37:02,565
The low-income home buyer can have just as nice a house as anybody else.

1512
01:37:04,235 --> 01:37:07,487
American families borrowed to finance their homes, their cars -

1513
01:37:07,655 --> 01:37:11,407
- their healthcare, and their children's educations.

1514
01:37:11,784 --> 01:37:14,452
People in the bottom 90 percent -

1515
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:19,499
- lost ground between 1 980 and 2007.

1516
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:24,170
It all went to the top 1 percent.

1517
01:37:26,382 --> 01:37:29,259
For the first time in history, average Americans -

1518
01:37:29,426 --> 01:37:34,222
- have less education and are less prosperous than their parents.

1519
01:37:36,392 --> 01:37:41,771
The era of greed and irresponsibility on Wall Street and in Washington -

1520
01:37:43,274 --> 01:37:45,316
- has led us to a financial crisis -

1521
01:37:45,484 --> 01:37:49,195
- as serious as any that we've faced since the Great Depression.

1522
01:37:49,363 --> 01:37:52,615
When the financial crisis struck before the 2008 election -

1523
01:37:53,075 --> 01:37:55,326
- Barack Obama pointed to Wall Street greed -

1524
01:37:55,494 --> 01:37:59,789
- and regulatory failures as examples of the need for change in America.

1525
01:37:59,957 --> 01:38:02,667
A lack of oversight in Washington and on Wall Street -

1526
01:38:02,835 --> 01:38:05,837
- is exactly what got us into this mess.

1527
01:38:06,463 --> 01:38:10,758
After taking office, Obama spoke of the need to reform the industry.

1528
01:38:10,926 --> 01:38:13,553
We want a risk regulator, increased capital requirements.

1529
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:17,015
We need a consumer financial protection agency.

1530
01:38:17,182 --> 01:38:19,017
We need to change Wall Street's culture.

1531
01:38:19,643 --> 01:38:22,604
But when finally enacted in mid-201 0 -

1532
01:38:22,771 --> 01:38:25,523
- the administration's financial reforms were weak.

1533
01:38:25,691 --> 01:38:29,152
And in some critical areas, including the rating agencies -

1534
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:31,571
- lobbying and compensation -

1535
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:34,699
- nothing significant was even proposed.

1536
01:38:34,867 --> 01:38:38,369
Addressing Obama and, quote, "regulatory reform" -

1537
01:38:38,537 --> 01:38:42,749
- my response, if it was one word, would be "ha."

1538
01:38:43,542 --> 01:38:46,002
There's very little reform.

1539
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:47,712
How come?

1540
01:38:48,839 --> 01:38:51,007
It's a Wall Street government.

1541
01:38:53,469 --> 01:38:57,013
Obama chose Timothy Geithner as Treasury secretary.

1542
01:38:57,181 --> 01:38:59,933
Geithner was president of the New York Federal Reserve -

1543
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:02,977
- during the crisis, and a key player in the decision -

1544
01:39:03,145 --> 01:39:05,730
- to pay Goldman Sachs 1 00 cents on the dollar -

1545
01:39:05,898 --> 01:39:07,815
- for its bets against mortgages.

1546
01:39:07,983 --> 01:39:10,985
When Tim Geithner was testifying -

1547
01:39:11,153 --> 01:39:13,363
- to be confirmed as Treasury secretary -

1548
01:39:13,530 --> 01:39:16,616
- he said, "I have never been a regulator."

1549
01:39:16,784 --> 01:39:19,369
That said to me he did not understand his job -

1550
01:39:19,536 --> 01:39:21,245
- as president of the New York Fed.

1551
01:39:25,584 --> 01:39:28,795
The new president of the New York Fed is William C. Dudley -

1552
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:31,506
- the former chief economist of Goldman Sachs -

1553
01:39:31,674 --> 01:39:34,842
- whose paper with Glenn Hubbard praised derivatives.

1554
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:37,387
Geithner's chief of staff is Mark Patterson -

1555
01:39:37,554 --> 01:39:39,639
- a former lobbyist for Goldman.

1556
01:39:39,807 --> 01:39:42,350
And one of the senior advisors is Lewis Sachs -

1557
01:39:42,518 --> 01:39:45,645
- who oversaw Tricadia, a company heavily involved -

1558
01:39:45,813 --> 01:39:49,440
- in betting against the mortgage securities it was selling.

1559
01:39:49,775 --> 01:39:52,443
To head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission -

1560
01:39:52,611 --> 01:39:56,406
- Obama picked Gary Gensler, a former Goldman Sachs executive -

1561
01:39:56,573 --> 01:39:59,492
- who had helped ban the regulation of derivatives.

1562
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:01,953
To run the Securities and Exchange Commission -

1563
01:40:02,121 --> 01:40:06,082
- Obama picked Mary Schapiro, the former CEO of FINRA -

1564
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:09,919
- the investment banking industry's self-regulation body.

1565
01:40:10,087 --> 01:40:12,422
Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel -

1566
01:40:12,589 --> 01:40:17,176
- made $320,000 serving on the board of Freddie Mac.

1567
01:40:17,428 --> 01:40:20,013
Both Martin Feldstein and Laura Tyson are members -

1568
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:23,766
- of Obama's Economic Recovery Advisory Board.

1569
01:40:24,101 --> 01:40:28,771
And Obama's chief economic advisor is Larry Summers.

1570
01:40:29,314 --> 01:40:31,149
The most senior economic advisors -

1571
01:40:31,316 --> 01:40:33,901
- are the ones who were there, who built the structure.

1572
01:40:34,153 --> 01:40:36,738
When it was clear that Summers and Geithner -

1573
01:40:36,905 --> 01:40:41,325
- were going to play major roles as advisors -

1574
01:40:41,493 --> 01:40:43,953
- l knew this was going to be status quo.

1575
01:40:44,621 --> 01:40:48,291
The Obama administration resisted regulation of bank compensation -

1576
01:40:48,459 --> 01:40:51,127
- even as foreign leaders took action.

1577
01:40:51,295 --> 01:40:53,671
The financial industry is a service industry.

1578
01:40:53,839 --> 01:40:57,216
It should serve others before it serves itself.

1579
01:40:57,676 --> 01:41:00,678
In September of 2009, Christine Lagarde -

1580
01:41:00,846 --> 01:41:03,639
- and the finance ministers of Sweden, the Netherlands -

1581
01:41:03,807 --> 01:41:07,143
- Luxembourg, Italy, Spain and Germany -

1582
01:41:07,311 --> 01:41:10,646
- called for the G20 nations, including the United States -

1583
01:41:10,814 --> 01:41:14,358
- to impose strict regulations on bank compensation.

1584
01:41:14,526 --> 01:41:16,486
And in July of 201 0 -

1585
01:41:16,653 --> 01:41:20,656
- the European Parliament enacted those very regulations.

1586
01:41:20,949 --> 01:41:24,160
The Obama administration had no response.

1587
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:28,372
Their view is it's a temporary blip and things will go back to normal.

1588
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:32,001
That is why l am reappointing him -

1589
01:41:32,169 --> 01:41:35,171
- as chairman of the Federal Reserve. Thank you, Ben.

1590
01:41:35,339 --> 01:41:39,175
ln 2009, Barack Obama reappointed Ben Bernanke.

1591
01:41:39,343 --> 01:41:40,510
Thank you, Mr. President.

1592
01:41:41,970 --> 01:41:45,848
As of mid-201 0, not a single senior financial executive -

1593
01:41:46,016 --> 01:41:49,018
- had been criminally prosecuted, or even arrested.

1594
01:41:49,186 --> 01:41:51,771
No special prosecutor had been appointed.

1595
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:54,732
Not a single firm had been prosecuted criminally -

1596
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:57,902
- for securities fraud or accounting fraud.

1597
01:41:58,070 --> 01:42:00,613
The Obama administration has made no attempt -

1598
01:42:00,781 --> 01:42:02,573
- to recover any compensation -

1599
01:42:02,741 --> 01:42:05,785
- given to financial executives during the bubble.

1600
01:42:06,954 --> 01:42:10,289
I certainly would think of criminal action -

1601
01:42:10,457 --> 01:42:14,127
- against some of Countrywide's top leaders, like Mozilo.

1602
01:42:14,294 --> 01:42:17,630
I'd certainly look at Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs -

1603
01:42:17,798 --> 01:42:20,049
- and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch.

1604
01:42:20,217 --> 01:42:22,718
-For criminal prosecutions? -Yes.

1605
01:42:22,886 --> 01:42:26,556
-ln regard to-- -Yes. They'd be very hard to win -

1606
01:42:26,765 --> 01:42:32,270
- but l think they could do it if they got enough underlings to tell the truth.

1607
01:42:32,604 --> 01:42:35,439
In an industry in which drug use, prostitution -

1608
01:42:35,607 --> 01:42:38,568
- and billing of prostitutes as a business expense -

1609
01:42:38,735 --> 01:42:40,570
- occur on an industrial scale -

1610
01:42:40,737 --> 01:42:44,699
- it wouldn't be hard to make people talk if you really wanted to.

1611
01:42:45,117 --> 01:42:48,411
They gave me a plea bargain and l took it.

1612
01:42:48,579 --> 01:42:50,663
They were not interested in my records.

1613
01:42:50,831 --> 01:42:52,498
They weren't interested in anything.

1614
01:42:52,666 --> 01:42:55,751
-Not interested in your records? -That's correct. Correct.

1615
01:42:55,919 --> 01:43:02,091
There's a sensibility that you don't use people's personal vices -

1616
01:43:02,259 --> 01:43:06,179
- in the context of Wall Street cases, necessarily, to get them to flip.

1617
01:43:06,346 --> 01:43:11,726
Maybe after the cataclysms that we've been through, people will reevaluate.

1618
01:43:11,894 --> 01:43:15,855
I'm not the one to pass judgment on that right now.

1619
01:43:29,161 --> 01:43:34,540
You come to us today telling us, "We're sorry, we didn't mean it.

1620
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:36,876
We won't do it again. Trust us."

1621
01:43:38,378 --> 01:43:41,005
Well, l have some people in my constituency -

1622
01:43:41,173 --> 01:43:43,883
- that actually robbed some of your banks.

1623
01:43:44,051 --> 01:43:45,968
And they say the same thing.

1624
01:43:46,136 --> 01:43:49,222
They're sorry. They didn't mean it. They won't do it again.

1625
01:43:49,806 --> 01:43:54,685
In 2009, as unemployment hit its highest level in 17 years -

1626
01:43:54,853 --> 01:43:58,147
- Morgan Stanley paid its employees over $1 4 billion -

1627
01:43:58,315 --> 01:44:01,484
- and Goldman Sachs paid out over $1 6 billion.

1628
01:44:01,652 --> 01:44:05,404
ln 201 0, bonuses were even higher.

1629
01:44:05,572 --> 01:44:09,033
Why should a financial engineer be paid -

1630
01:44:09,201 --> 01:44:15,373
- four times to 1 00 times more than a real engineer?

1631
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:17,708
A real engineer build bridges.

1632
01:44:17,876 --> 01:44:21,212
A financial engineer build dreams.

1633
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:25,007
And, you know, when those dreams turn out to be nightmares -

1634
01:44:25,175 --> 01:44:26,884
- other people pay for it.

1635
01:44:29,388 --> 01:44:30,513
For decades -

1636
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:34,350
- the American financial system was stable and safe.

1637
01:44:34,726 --> 01:44:36,686
But then something changed.

1638
01:44:36,853 --> 01:44:40,189
The financial industry turned its back on society -

1639
01:44:40,357 --> 01:44:42,817
- corrupted our political system -

1640
01:44:43,235 --> 01:44:45,903
- and plunged the world economy into crisis.

1641
01:44:47,906 --> 01:44:50,866
At enormous cost, we've avoided disaster -

1642
01:44:51,159 --> 01:44:53,119
- and are recovering.

1643
01:44:53,495 --> 01:44:57,331
But the men and institutions that caused the crisis are still in power -

1644
01:44:57,499 --> 01:44:59,542
- and that needs to change.

1645
01:45:00,669 --> 01:45:02,795
They will tell us that we need them -

1646
01:45:02,963 --> 01:45:07,133
- and that what they do is too complicated for us to understand.

1647
01:45:07,926 --> 01:45:10,219
They will tell us it won't happen again.

1648
01:45:10,595 --> 01:45:13,889
They will spend billions fighting reform.

1649
01:45:14,266 --> 01:45:16,350
It won't be easy.

1650
01:45:17,644 --> 01:45:21,272
But some things are worth fighting for.
